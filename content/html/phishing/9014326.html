This guide will help you get started quickly and safely with your Ledger device, ensuring a smooth and secure onboarding process.</p><h3>Step 1: Unbox Your Ledger Device</h3><p>When you unbox your Ledger device, you’ll find the Ledger device itself, a USB cable, recovery sheets, and a quick start guide. Inspect each item to confirm everything is intact and original. Please avoid using any third-party cables or components to ensure compatibility and security.</p><h3>Step 2: Download Ledger Live</h3><p>To manage your crypto assets, download the Ledger Live app from our official website (ledger.com/live). Ledger Live is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as iOS and Android for mobile use. Ensure that you only download from Ledger’s official website to avoid phishing scams.</p><h3>Step 3: Set Up Your Ledger Device</h3><p>Plug your Ledger device into your computer and follow the on-screen instructions in Ledger Live. You’ll be prompted to set up a PIN code—choose a strong one, as it protects your device if it’s lost or stolen. <strong>Important:</strong> Do not share your PIN with anyone.</p><h3>Step 4: Write Down Your Recovery Phrase</h3><p>The Ledger device will generate a unique 24-word recovery phrase. Carefully write each word in the correct order on the recovery sheets provided, and store them in a safe, offline location. <strong>Warning:</strong> Never share or store your recovery phrase digitally. This phrase is your backup to recover access to your assets if you lose your device.</p><h3>Step 5: Add Your Crypto Accounts</h3><p>Once set up, open Ledger Live to add crypto accounts. Ledger supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, so you can start managing and securing your assets directly from the app.</p><h3>Step 6: Stay Secure</h3><p>Ledger provides unparalleled security for your crypto assets, but it’s essential to remain vigilant. Never share sensitive information like your recovery phrase or PIN, and beware of phishing attempts.</p><p><strong>Start Your Ledger Journey</strong>With these steps, you’re now ready to securely manage your digital assets with Ledger.

Enjoy the peace of mind that comes with top-tier security!</p></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=6731a8d7021e5e6240f7b9fb" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6731a8d7021e5e6240f7b9fb/js/webflow.7e939bc70.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
