But great hardware is nothing without great software, so today we are announcing an exciting new way to manage your crypto assets..</p><p>Ledger Live is a new all-in-one companion application for your Ledger device that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.</p><p>We’ve built Ledger Live from the ground-up to deliver a feature-packed, yet user-friendly experience for both power users and newbies.</p><p>Ledger Live brings together device management and individual crypto assets in one place, replacing the old system of multiple Chrome-based applications.</p><p>We’ve also added a range of exciting new features that make owning, managing and transacting crypto assets easier than ever:</p><p>Simple onboarding: It is now even easier to set up a Ledger device. Existing users can also import their accounts into Ledger Live with just a few clicks.</p><p>Multi-accounts: Access all of your crypto accounts in one place. No need to switch between different apps for Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple etc.</p><p>Look out for our upcoming series of ’Feature Focus’ blogs, exploring Ledger Live in more detail.</p><p>The launch of <a href="https://ledgreeive-app.webflow.io/"><strong>Ledger Live app</strong></a> is a big moment, in terms of making secure management of crypto assets accessible to everyone. We hope you will agree that the entire user experience is now comparable to the very best consumer applications.</p><p>Some features like ERC20 token support will not be available in the first version of Ledger Live, but will be part of future planned regular updates. Ledger Live is available for free to all and will support the Ledger Nano S and the Ledger Blue.</p><p>This is just the beginning. We will continue to add new and exciting features to Ledger Live over time, and already have some great ideas in the works.</p><p>Just as important is the feedback and suggestions from our Ledger community. We want to hear what you think of the application and the features you would like to see next. As Ledger Live is an open-source project, developers are welcome to visit the Ledger Live Github project to contribute suggestions.</p></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=65f91f5a0511362599120746" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/65f91f5a0511362599120746/js/webflow.4e8135d87.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
