          </b>Well it's been just over 7 years now since I came out to California 
          from Florida to work in the wonderful world of Television. I LOVE LA! 
          The weather, the mountains, the crazy creative energy and the amazing 
          melting pot of people all out here to follow their dreams of being a 
          part of the Entertainment industry! I've been steadily continuing my 
          profession of Producing on various TV Productions here in Hollywood. 
          I've been fortunate to have Produced, Directed, Written and Coordinated 
          for some of the biggest studios and networks in town like Disney, Paramount, 
          Warner Bros, G4TV, ABC, FOX, G4TV, E!, MTV, NBC, VH1, LTN (wow, that&#146;s 
          a lot of 3 lettered networks). I've taken a bit of hiatus from production 
          now and am back pursuing one of my other career loves, that of working 
          full-time in Motion Picture Marketing for the Walt Disney Studios. Juggling 
          that along with a family you can imagine my time is maximized, but always 
          full of fun and new things so keep checking back for updates frequently! 
          Thanks... -Steve C</font>

            the past few months have been really hectic and keeping up w/ my picture 
            updates has proven to be a challenge, but normally my Gallery Website 
            below is constantly being updated with new pictures and links. Please 
            feel free to take a look around, bookmark it for later, and please 
            check back frequently for on-going additions, events and announcements. 
            My Live Journal which can be found below as well, if you can't wait 
            for the next quarterly &quot;Steve C Update&quot;, then pop in every 
            once in awhile to see what's new with me (Seriously, I'm way behind 
            on it as well, but I'll be catching up soon,I hope!!!) Thanks, -Steve
