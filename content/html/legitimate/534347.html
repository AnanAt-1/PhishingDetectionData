The students get rewarded based off attendance and not their work performance in class. She holds her title as Principal over every one of her staff members heads. If your child have an Iep pleaseee please please don&#39;t send them here. They have no structure what so ever. This school is a big daycare. You have to pray your lucky enough to get one of the teachers who actually care about their students learning and trust me, ITS VERY FEW OF THEM! The principle hides in her office when a parent comes to the school and wants to meet with her. Its honestly nothing at this school to make the students WANT to be here. The list goes on and on. I can go on for days. To sum this all up. DO NOT PUT YOUR KIDS IN THIS SCHOOL. If all of us parents speak up we can make a change seriously. Start by getting the principal, assistant principal, and half the staff out of there asap. I cant speak for everyone but I’ll be at the board of ed everyday starting tomorrow until something is done. I’ll be emailing and contacting EVERYONE. MY VOICE WILL BE HEARD !!!!!">
  This school is honestly one of my worst experience ever. The principal is HORRIBLE. She do not care about these students academically. They will blow your phone completely up if your child is absent 1<span>... <a href="javascript:void(0);">More</a></span>

<span class="js-shortened-text" data-shortened-text-rest="  backgrounds come together to create a truly unique community. The teachers are kind, supportive, and dedicated to their students&#39; success, while the students themselves are engaged and friendly.

BTECH offers a wide range of opportunities for involvement, from numerous clubs to a student lounge that provides a quiet space for studying after school. The principal actively encourages students to give back to the community, organizing initiatives like food drives, winter coat donations, and more. This spirit of generosity and support extends throughout the school—everyone is open and eager to help those in need.

The PTA and parent coordinator are incredibly involved and supportive, ensuring a well-connected and welcoming school environment. The campus itself is clean, organized, and intentionally small, making it an ideal setting for shy students or teens with special needs.

One of the standout aspects of my son&#39;s time at BTECH has been the enriching experiences outside the classroom. He has gone on several field trips, including traveling abroad with friends, which has broadened his perspective. On top of that, he is graduating not only with honors but also with 30 college credits from a local community college, thanks to BTECH&#39;s early college program that allowed him to start earning credits in ninth grade.

This school has provided him with the tools, guidance, and confidence to thrive academically and personally, and he couldn’t be happier with his journey.">
