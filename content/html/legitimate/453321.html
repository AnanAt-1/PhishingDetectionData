<H3>The pre-Ball years</H3>
The area of Muncie, Indiana that is now known as Ball State University had its start in 1899 as a private school called the Eastern Indiana Normal School to educate teachers. The entire school, including classrooms, library, and the president's residence were housed in what is now known as the Ball State Administration building.<br />
<br />
The one-building school had a peak enrollment of 256 and charged $10 for a year's tuition. It operated until the spring of 1901, when it was closed by its president, F.A.Z. Kumler, due to the lack of funding. A year later, in the autumn of 1902, the school reopened as Palmer University for the next three years when Francis Palmer, a retired Indiana banker, gave the school a $100,000 <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("17230",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("17230")' href="/topics/Financial_endowment">endowment</a><span class="hp" id="m17230"><div class="hpHeader">Financial endowment</div><div class="hpContent">A financial endowment is a transfer of money or property donated to an institution.  The total value of an institution's investments is often referred to as the institution's endowment and is typically organized as a public charity, private foundation, or trust....</div><br></span>.<br />
<br />
Between 1905 and 1907, the school dropped the Palmer name and operated as the Indiana Normal College. It had two divisions, the Normal School for educating teachers and the College of Applied Sciences. The school had an average enrollment of approximately 200 students. Due to a diminishing enrollment and lack of funding, school president Francis Ingler closed Indiana Normal College at the end of the 1906–07 school year.<br />
<br />
Between 1907 and 1912 the campus sat vacant. In 1912, a group of local investors led by Michael Kelly reopened the school as the Indiana Normal Institute. To pay for updated materials and refurbishing the once-abandoned Administration Building, the school operated under a mortgage from the Muncie Trust Company. Although the school had its largest student body with a peak enrollment of 806, officials could not maintain mortgage payments, and the school was forced to close once again in June 1917 when the Muncie Trust Company initiated <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("42544",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("42544")' href="/topics/Foreclosure">foreclosure</a><span class="hp" id="m42544"><div class="hpHeader">Foreclosure</div><div class="hpContent">Foreclosure is the legal process by which a mortgage lender , or other lien holder, obtains a termination of a mortgage borrower 's equitable right of redemption, either by court order or by operation of law...</div><br></span>&nbsp;proceedings.<br />

The close relationship between the Balls and the school led to an unofficial moniker for the college as many students, faculty and local politicians casually referred to the school as "Ball State" as a shorthand alternative to its longer, official name. During the 1922 short session of the Indiana legislature, the state renamed the school as Ball Teachers College. This was in recognition to the Ball family's continuing beneficence to the institution. During this act, the state also reorganized its relationship with Terre Haute and established a separate local board of trustees for the Muncie campus.<br />

The Ball brothers continued giving to the university and partially funded the construction of the Science Hall (now called Burkhardt Building) in 1924 and an addition to Ball Gymnasium in 1925. By the 1925–26 school year, Ball State enrollment reached 991 students: 697 women and 294 men. Based on the school's close relationship with the Ball Corporation, a long-running nickname for the school was "Fruit Jar Tech."<br />

<div class='thumb tright'><img src='http://image.absoluteastronomy.com/images/encyclopediaimages/b/be/beneficience.jpg'/></div>
During the regular legislative session of 1929, the Indiana General Assembly formally separated the Terre Haute and Muncie campuses of the state teachers college system, but it placed the governing of the Ball State campus under the Indiana State Teachers College Board of Trustees based in Terre Haute. With this action, the school was renamed Ball State Teachers College. The following year, enrollment increased to 1,118, with 747 female and 371 male students.<br />

In 1935, the school added the Arts Building for art, music, and dance instruction (now used by the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("46314",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("46314")' href="/topics/Ball_State_University_Museum_of_Art">Ball State University Museum of Art</a><span class="hp" id="m46314"><div class="hpHeader">Ball State University Museum of Art</div><div class="hpContent">The Ball State University Museum of Art is an art museum located in the Fine Arts building on the campus of Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, USA....</div><br></span>&nbsp;and the Geological Science and Social Work departments).

In 1961, Ball State became fully independent of Indiana State University via the creation of the Ball State College Board of Trustees, so that Ball State was no longer governed remotely by the Indiana State College Board of Trustees. The official name of the school also was changed to Ball State College.<br />

Ball State has seen a trend of near-constant growth since its creation, and current enrollment is the highest in the school's history. Seven academic colleges now offer 175 bachelor's, 103 master's, and 17 doctoral degrees, a sharp increase from the five degree programs initially offered by the University.

Ball State's campus life revolves around two main quadrangles. The original historic quadrangle is at the south end of campus near L. A. Pittenger Student Center. The newer quadrangle is located to the north and consists of a variety of modern buildings, including Bracken Library and the cultural venue for recitals, ensembles, and films, Pruis Hall.<br />
<br />
Despite the two quadrangles, the most heavily-utilized buildings on campus are situated along McKinley Avenue (which runs north-south) and Riverside Avenue (which runs east-west). The intersection of the two streets is nicknamed the "scramble light" after its <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("72885",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("72885")' href="/topics/Pedestrian_scramble">pedestrian scramble</a><span class="hp" id="m72885"><div class="hpHeader">Pedestrian scramble</div><div class="hpContent">A pedestrian scramble, also known as a  'X' Crossing , diagonal crossing , scramble intersection , and more poetically Barnes Dance, is a pedestrian crossing system that stops all vehicular traffic and allows pedestrians to cross an intersection in every direction, including diagonally, at the same...</div><br></span>&nbsp;feature.

In September 2006, the University rejected a proposal to build a new student center. In lieu of a new building, the University approved a remodel and expansion, which was completed recently.<br />
<H3> Ball Honors House </H3>
The Edmund F. and Virginia B. Ball Honors House is the new home of Ball State University’s Honor College. The white Colonial-style house, which was originally built in the 1930s, has undergone $1.3 million in renovations. The home is only a short distance from the DeHority Complex, which houses many Honors College students. The home has three classrooms (two of them fully technology-equipped), administrative offices for staff, a full kitchen, and private gathering areas for students. The Honors College was previous located in the basement of Carmichael Hall.<br />
<H3>Student Housing</H3>
The University currently operates ten residence complexes that house nearly 7,000 students. Ball State's freshman residence hall program is listed as one of the best in the nation by the "Unofficial, Unbiased Insider's Guide to the Most Interesting Colleges."<br />

This co-ed facility, completed in 1967, has four L-shaped, eight-story units, and a ten story tower in the center that houses mainly non-traditional and international students. Johnson Complex, on the north end of campus, is a modern complex consisting of one eight-story building and two four-story buildings. The complex is the only one on campus to feature Z-shaped rooms.<br />
<br />
In addition, Ball State has one all-female residence hall that houses approximately 600 students. The Woodworth Complex comprises four halls and also houses sorority suites. In the fall of 2007, a two-story dining facility and atrium attached to the complex re-opened after two years of renovations.<br />
<br />
Of the current residence halls in operation, only one, <a rel='nofollow' class='greylink1' href="http://www.bsu.edu/directory/buildings/default.asp?buildingcode=EL">Elliott Hall</a>, has been in operation for most of the University's history.

In addition to the residence halls, two apartment complexes operated by the University provide affordable homes for single students and students with families.

The apartments are located close to campus, shopping, restaurants, entertainment, and schools.<br />

Three of Ball State's taller residence halls – Lafollette, Johnson B, and Studebaker East – have unusual elevator systems because the halls were early co-ed dorms. As such, their elevators serve only two floors: the first floor lobby and the sixth floor lobby, which duplicates the first floor almost exactly. This served to separate the male and female portions of the dormitory, as the stairs pass through lobby doors.<br />

<H4> History </H4>
Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Ball State campus since 1919, but this date was chosen due to an inaccuracy in records. It could be said that Greek-letter organizations at Ball State date back to 1905 with the founding of Indiana Normal School and College of Applied Science, Ball State's predecessor. Historical records are not specific regarding the number of Greek-letter organizations founded during this time. However, records show that, in 1907 the president, Francis M. Ingler decreed all fraternities to be disbanded. This was decided after a cow was discovered roaming through the Phi Sigma Theta fraternity house. Indiana Normal School and College of Applied Science also closed in 1907.<br />
<br />
The Eastern Branch of the Indiana State Normal School, which later became Ball State University, opened in 1918. The Girls Club started within a year of the school's founding. This followed in the tradition of the organization at Indiana State Normal School in Terre Haute. All girls were eligible to become club members. Local sororities started in sections of the club beginning with Alpha sorority in 1920, which later became <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("80425",this,"alpha_chi_omega.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("80425")' href="/topics/Alpha_Chi_Omega">Alpha Chi Omega</a><span class="hp" id="m80425"><div class="hpHeader">Alpha Chi Omega</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i80425"></div>Alpha Chi Omega  is a women's fraternity founded on October 15, 1885.

With the inaccuracy of records before the Girls club's founding, Ball State University celebrates 1919 as the founding year for the Greek community at Ball State.<br />
<br />
The Navajo social club, the first men's organization at Ball State, also was founded in 1920. The club later became Lambda Chi Alpha. Ball State did not have a large collection of national organizations until the mid-1950s, as many local organizations began affiliating with national fraternities and sororities.<br />
<H4> Chapters </H4>
Ball State is home to 27 Greek organizations on campus, including 15 fraternities and 12 sororities. Around eight percent of all undergraduates are members of the Greek community, with over 1,200 students maintaining membership in a Greek organization.<br />

Emphasizing immersive learning experiences, Ball State operates a satellite campus in Indianapolis and Muncie, as well as a number of specialized centers abroad. The Rinker Center for International Programs is responsible for maintaining these satellite campuses.<br />
<H3>Australia Center</H3>
Second only to the London Center in popularity, one of the most popular study abroad programs is the Australia Center.

In partnership with the Monteverde Rainforest Institute, the Costa Rica Center offers students a chance to combine academics with Central American customs, traditions, and values while serving the surrounding communities.  Trips to the Center are offered as semester-long or 6-week terms.
