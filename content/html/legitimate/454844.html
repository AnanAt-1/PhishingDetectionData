This duty involved keeping convoy routes open, breaking and finding leads in ice for the Greenland convoys, escorting the convoys and rescuing survivors from torpedoed ships, constructing and maintaining aids to navigation, and reporting weather conditions.  Ships of the patrol were also expected to discover and destroy enemy weather and radio stations in Greenland, continue hydrographic surveys, maintain communications, deliver supplies, and conduct search and rescue operations.  All of these duties, the Coast Guard performed with exemplary fortitude and faithfulness throughout the war.  It was during this time that she was designated as WPG-46.<br />
<br />
In both World Wars, when submarines were more of a menace than icebergs, the International Ice Patrol was suspended so that the cutters could perform more important escort duty.  During these years there was but one major collision; British ship Svend Foyne struck a berg 21 January 1943.  Before she sank Modoc rescued 128 survivors.<br />

Close to midnight 24 May Modoc found herself in the midst of an attack in which eight planes and three warships were involved.  Antiaircraft fire from Bismarck whizzed dangerously close to the cutter's port bow.  HMS Norfolk was about to take the cutter under fire until HMS Prince of Wales identified her as U.S. Coast Guard.  The cutter was undamaged, although they were near the fighting and at times only six miles from Bismarck.  The widespread movements of the combatants, 19 plus destroyers and smaller ships, had distributed danger over a wide area.  Aircraft had played a continuous part in coordinating activities, thus adding to the danger of accidents to innocent bystanders, a role the cutters had to play prior to Pearl Harbor.<br />

Modoc returned to the Treasury Department in accordance with Executive Order No. 9666 of 28 December 1945, and served as a patrol cutter until decommissioning in 1947.  Sold to Manuel Velliantis in Honduras, she was converted for merchant use and renamed Amalia V.
