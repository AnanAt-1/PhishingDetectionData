<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="90%"><b><font color="#FFFFCC">One of my dreams growing
up in the 70's and 80's was to have my own arcade games at my house.&nbsp;
I had a few console systems, but that's about as far as the Arcade experience
got for me.&nbsp; Whenever I had a controller for a console system, I would
imagine how I would transform it into a real Arcade Style Joystick.&nbsp;
When I bought a Super Nintendo Entertainment System years ago I bought
a joystick at the Thousand Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks, CA from a shop called
Babbages.&nbsp; It was rather large, and had almost perfect Real Arcade
controls.&nbsp; I loved playing games like Super Smash TV and Street Fighter
II games, as well as Mortal Kombat games.&nbsp; Using the joystick was
fun like the Arcade for a while, but in time I grew tired of the joystick
and sold it at a swap meet for like $30.&nbsp; I now feel quite stupid
for doing that now that people are collecting the Super Nintendo.&nbsp;</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Well it's 1999 and now I can finally say that
I have my dream come true in the form of some really nice Arcade Game Emulators
and a Real Arcade Joystick I made with the help of a few web pages on the
net and my friend Dutch who has many wood-working power tools.</font></b>

<br>Wires!&nbsp; What's that near the bottom left?&nbsp;
<br>A Sidewinder?&nbsp; naw, really?&nbsp; haha&nbsp;</center>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Where to start?</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Buy a Sidewinder.&nbsp; Order the Happ controls.&nbsp;
Make sure you have the soldering iron (thin tip) and some rosin core solder.&nbsp;
Grab some standard wire (I used speaker wire I already had - works fine)
not too thick, but wound wire (not single thread) and cut pieces big enough
for the wires to stretch like 12-14 inches for the buttons which are to
be far from the game pad's pc board, and smaller ones to daisy chain the
ground.&nbsp; Label the wires the same as what you see on the contacts
on the sidewinder.&nbsp; Once you understand the points on the sidewinder
you'll get a bit excited.&nbsp; It's freaking SIMPLE.&nbsp; I attached
the ground to the back where the original solder is - right next to one
of the BR/BL red wires (either ground is fine).&nbsp; I only tinned the
iron and heated the old solder and dropped a wire down in it.&nbsp; Boom.&nbsp;
Make a list of the stuff you need from this page, and make sure you have
it all before you start.&nbsp; Label all the wires on both ends so you
can go into NO BRAIN mode (helps sometimes) and I tinned one of the ends
(the ones that go into the points on the sidewinder just to make it a tad
easier (experienced solder people omit this part if you like).</font></b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">There are a couple of web sites I visited to
get a better picture of the project.&nbsp; <a href="http://underworld.fortunecity.com/riven/208/index.htm" target="_top">This
one</a> has some really good pictures of the solder points on the Sidewinder
<a href="http://underworld.fortunecity.com/riven/208/images/solder4.jpg" target="_top">(top

right)</a> <a href="http://underworld.fortunecity.com/riven/208/images/solder1.jpg" target="_top">(bottom)</a>.&nbsp;
You'll see them empty when you open the Sidewinder up for gutting. <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~staroscik/arcade/" target="_top">Here'</a>s
a site that has some more projects, and a <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~staroscik/arcade/pics/button-under.jpg" target="_top">great
picture</a> of just which point to ground to on the Arcade Buttons.&nbsp;</font></b>

<br>Interesting Polaroid effects on this one&nbsp;</center>

<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">The Prototype</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">It's very necessary to make a "Prototype" of
the project to make sure the soldering you did works, and also to get the
basic layout of the buttons and joystick.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFCC">Grab a cardboard box and use the gray washers
that attach the pushbuttons -&nbsp; to pencil in circles to cut on the
cardboard.&nbsp; Use the same washer to pencil in the center of the joystick
since it needs to move a little.&nbsp; Grab and exacto knife and cut the
holes and screw all the stuff in.&nbsp; Oh yeah - the prototype job (cardboard)
is essential to happiness.&nbsp; If you run into any problems you need
to stay on this phase.&nbsp; I would include a picture of the prototype
box, but it doesn't deserve photo paper.&nbsp; Ugly indeed.&nbsp; haha</font></b>
