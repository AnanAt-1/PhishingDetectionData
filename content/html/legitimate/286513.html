 <h1>Silicon Dreams</h1> 
 -->
 
 <h3>by Jonathan Souza</h3> 
 </center> 
  
 <p>This adventure is for a team of black ops, optimally a team of two 
 Combat ops, 
 one Tech op, one Security op, one Intel op, and one Science op. 
 Variations on this theme 
 are allowable, as the Company will give the team the required members. 
 The team 
 should be fairly well experienced (about 4-5 missions under their belt), 
 and the team has 
 to be pretty skilled in dealing with problems via their heads more than 
 their guns.</p>
  
 <h2>Starting Out</h2> 
  
 <p>The team gets their first warning when the Company contacts them and 
 sends 
 them a message via Omicron to report in for a briefing.  The briefing is 
 in the form of 
 unlabeled videotape and an envelope of papers on the subject.  The 
 videotape is direct, 
 and to the point: </p>
  
 <center> 
 <table width="90%"> 
 <tr> 
 <td> 
 <p>Hello and good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  A few days ago, Centurion 
  
 Computing Systems released a new palmtop computer called the Centex. 
 This 
 computer is equal or better to the Cistron that we issue to Technology 
 ops.  In 
 addition, we've been hearing reports from inside that they're going to 
 release new 
 technologies that are equal or better to our own.  There's a suspicion 
 of possible 
 interference by extra-terrestrial influences and such.  You're to 
 discover if this is 
 due to Grey or other ET influences, or possible compromise by someone in 
 the 
 Company.  Your equipment list is in the envelope as well as information 
 on the 
 company itself.</p> 
 </table> 
 </center> 
  
 <p>The tape self-destructs soon afterwards, and the players should review 
 the 
 equipment list, which gives them:
  
 <ul> 
 <li> Enough automatic pistols (all in .40 caliber Glocks) to equip the 
 entire team, and silencers for the guns. 
 <li> Ammo for the guns. 
 <li> A full set of surveillance and computer-cracking gear. 
 <li> Heavy monocrys armor for the combat ops, light monocrys armor for 
 everyone else. 
 <li> Information and paperwork to help the ops to get into the company with 
 identities, as 
 hired workers. 
 </ul> 
 </p> 
 <p>In addition, the team can request any sort of equipment listed in the 
 book (except 
 for experimental gear) within 12 hours and requests for personnel within 
 24.  The 
 information on Centurion Computing Systems (CCS) is like many other 
 startup computer 
 companies in San Francisco -- a nutty bunch of inventors and developers that 
 gave up jobs 
 with bigger companies and went to work independently.  The company has twenty-two employees, and none of them have had contact with anyone that has worked 
 for an Argus 
 front company, according to the investigation.  The team has tickets to 
 San Francisco 
 Airport and their gear will arrive at the safehouse at the same time 
 they do.</p> 
  
 
 <img src="/pyramid/gifbin/2000/blackops_saucers.jpg" width=300 height=599 alt="Silicon Dreams" vspace=6 hspace=8 align=left>
 
 <h2>Getting To Work</h2> 
  
 <p>The team of ops arrives at the safehouse and start getting set on the 
 job.  The 
 safehouse has vehicles  for the team: one minivan for surveillance (treat as 
 a TL 7 van, except for TL 8 sensors and a instant chameleon), and enough mid-sized cars to carry the team (all look like TL 7 equivalent cars, but built with TL 8 gear and armored). 
 The team should, by the first day, have figured out how they will get started.</p>
  
 <p>The first thing the team should do is investigating the company itself. 
 CCS 
 recently moved into a new office complex in San Jose, and getting hired 
 with the 
 expanding company would be easy for the ops.  The team quickly realizes 
 that it's the top 
 four people -- the head of the company, Walter Morrow; his two best friends 
 Nick Allyson 
 and Wang-Li Gi; and the girl that gave them the garage to work in, Lisa 
 Patterson -- that are 
 the inventive and creative parts of the company.  There appears to be no 
 form of contact or 
 method of transmitting information to the four -- taps on their e-mail 
 system both at home 
 and at work seems to be a mixture of work e-mail, bad jokes and stories, 
 and some erotic 
 commentary about the relationships in the office.</p>
  
 <p>If the team decides to break in and search the homes of the four 
 top people, 
 all they'll find is somewhat messy apartments and maybe a little bit of 
 pot and cocaine.  GMs should be willing to play this up for all it's 
 worth, as a team of very well-trained covert ops try their best not to 
 get caught by rent-a-cops, and what happens if they do. 
 Working out a check on the top people for Grey implants would be 
 difficult, but not 
 impossible -- the team will learn that they were checked and found clean. 
 Expanding to 
 search the twenty-plus people of the company will take too much time for 
 the ops, but 
 they will quickly discover one piece of information  -- of all the employees, only 
 ten, including the top four 
 people -- have been with the company since they started their innovative 
 streak.</p>
  
 <p>During this investigation, the team will hear that CCS is about to 
 release a new 
 computer system -- the Navi system -- which would be easily equal to a TL 9 
 mini-computer. 
 The ops will hear from the Company that unless the Navi can be proven not to 
 be developed by hostile forces, it has to be stopped or the creation and 
 the creators 
 destroyed.  The estimated release date of the Navi is one month, and the 
 team is ordered 
 to resolve the problem in under a month or "clean up" the situation.</p> 
  
 <p>Hunting down these ten people will quickly winnow down one name -- Morgana 
 Lafayette.  She's a twenty-six year old secretary and her personal 
 history has a few major 
 "blanks" in it, as well as having some other problems -- including that she 
 was rumored to 
 be the lover of the top people in the company.  Searching her apartment 
 will quickly reveal 
 several things that will make the ops suspicious.  A doctor's 
 prescription for 
 Pitremenopine (which Science ops will tell players is commonly used by 
 people with 
 psionic talents to keep their powers from working while they sleep) and 
 documentation 
 on certain items of hardware of early TL 9 computer designs are only just 
 a few of the 
 things found.</p>
  
 <p>Interrogation of Morgana will reveal that she had been getting visions 
 of such 
 things -- but she hadn't revealed the plans to the company.  A good team of 
 investigators 
 will reveal that where she had some of her blank spots have had links to 
 Grey operating 
 zones.  Calling in a PsiOp to check on her story will reveal that she's 
 telling the truth -- but  
 she does have some latent telepathic ability.  And, she does have a Grey 
 implant in her, 
 which looks like it had been placed there in one her "blank" periods a 
 few years ago.</p>
  
 <h2>Hunting Down The Grey Road</h2> 
  
 <p>The players will have to use Morgana's telepathic link to the Greys to 
 find the 
 Grey nest.  They broadcast the plans to her, and her own telepathic 
 ability "relays" the 
 signal to one of the four inventors, who think that it's their own idea 
 (and they 
 innovate on it).  By helping human computer technology grow more 
 rapidly, the Greys 
 have access to hardware to rebuild their ships and equipment.  They 
 didn't develop the 
 Navi system, but they will make use of it to get access to more and 
 better hardware.</p>
  
 <p>Tracking down the Greys will be difficult.  The moment they realize that 
 Morgana 
 has been compromised, they will cut the link to her and start packing up 
 to leave  
 the area.  But what they didn't know is that they left enough 
 information in Morgana's 
 head to let the ops be lead to the area where they established their base. 
 Assuming that there 
 is a Psi-Op available, the Op will be able to narrow down the signal to 
 within about ten 
 degrees and a thirty-mile arc in the southeast of Morgana's apartment. 
 Contacting the 
 Company for information on Grey psi-transmitters, they'll indicate that 
 the estimated 
 range of transmitters is about forty miles -- and is about the size of a 
 small car. 
 Investigating warehouses and other type of locations (as the area is too 
 well-inhabited for 
 the Greys to establish a concealed base without someone noticing it) 
 will reveal that a 
 large warehouse was rented in the last six months.  This warehouse is 
 next to the San Jose 
 Airport, and is of sufficient size to hold both a Grey saucer and the 
 transmitter hardware.</p>
  
 <p>The warehouse has armed guards carrying M16s (see Grey Guards stats), 
 claming 
 that the warehouse is under FBI investigation, and no story or 
 documentation that the 
 team uses will allow the team into the warehouse.  Any attempts to 
 force or bribe their 
 way in will cause the guards to go from firm statements to deadly force, 
 very rapidly. 
 Using FBI contacts or checking to make sure that there is a real FBI 
 investigation will 
 quickly reveal that the FBI doesn't have any idea of what's going on at 
 the warehouse. 
 The team does detect, if they're doing surveillance of the warehouse, a 
 lot of activities -- 
 clean-up activities that seem to be coming close to a 
 resolution -- sometime that night, 
 probably about 3-4 am.</p>
  
 <h2>Cleaning Up The Problem</h2> 
  
 <p>The team really has two options at this point -- let the Greys escape or 
 attack the 
 warehouse at some point that night.  The first option isn't one the Company 
 would really 
 like, but if the team does it, they'll see the "FBI" guards open up a 
 door in the warehouse 
 and the saucer will take off; the guards will quickly disperse to six 
 cars and drive them away in separate directions.  No amount of tailing will reveal 
 where the guards get 
 in contact with the Greys, or their equipment -- and no amount of 
 interrogation will reveal this, either. 
 However, the Greys do have an implant in all the guards.  If they let the Greys escape, the team will 
 be told that their handing of the situation wasn't perfect and will be 
 told to do better next 
 time.</p>
  
 <p>The second option is the one the Company would prefer.  Besides the 
 players, the 
 Company can provide three Combat ops and a Security op to help keep the 
 scene clear of 
 people not involved in the little attack.  All team members will have a 
 Castor '94 Assault 
 Carbine and a Heavy Monocrys suit, as well as communications gear for 
 the assault.  Any 
 other reasonable gear (grenades, night vision gear, etc), will be 
 provided.   Exotic or 
 experimental gear will require the players to have a very good reason 
 for it (and require good rolls on their Fast Talk skills).</p>
  
 <p>The layout of the warehouse is fairly straightforward,  but 
 there are several locations worth noting and being aware of. 
  
 <ul> 
 <li><b>Front Office.</b>  This room is accessible from the street.  It has a few simple chairs, a receptionist's desk, and an old 
 coffee machine. 
 There is not much else here, except for two Grey Guards waiting.  One is behind the 
 desk, the other 
 is sitting down enjoying his coffee (they'll both have to take an action 
 to bring their 
 weapons to the ready).  The receptionist's computer has no real 
 information on it 
 other than a few appointments for the "cover" staff. 
 <li><b>Office Space.</b> The front office leads to this area.  These are several small offices (consider the walls PD 2, DR 20). 
 There are four 
 Grey Guards in the office, sipping coffee and chatting about "government 
 foul-ups." 
 Unless previously alerted either by Grey telepathy, gunfire, or the 
 other Guards, it will 
 take two actions for the Guards to be ready for combat (one to get their 
 weapons, one 
 to ready them).  The computers in the offices are fairly standard, and 
 have no real 
 information on them. 
 <li><b>Bathrooms.</b> Leading off from the office space are men's and women's bathrooms.  Each has two stalls.  Other than that, ordinary. 
 <li><b>"Security Area."</b>  This room adjacent to the office space has two ready Grey Guards that can respond to an 
 attack instantly. The walls of this area, the warehouse area around the saucer, and the large doors exiting the warehouse, is 
 PD 3, DR 100. 
 The door has a retinal/telepathic lock and the door itself is DR 250. It leads to a large area where the Grey Saucer is being held.
 <li><b>Curtain.</b> Dividing the area between the Security Area and the floor where the Saucer is, this curtain is very flimsy and easy to damage; bullets will just go through it, and a knife will easily cut it. It seems to part the moment the players put an object through it, and has 
 no real effect on play other than to act as an obscurant for the Saucer (-4 to hit). 
 <li><b>Grey Saucer and Equipment.</b> A team of four Greys is working here.  Two 
 are loading 
 the equipment on the saucer (several large items, using contra-grav 
 pallets to help 
 manipulate them).   One is breaking down equipment with a tool, and the 
 last one is at 
 the seat of the saucer, powering up the reactor to allow the saucer to 
 take off.  The 
 moment the attack happens (the first Grey Guard that detects an Ops will 
 set off the 
 alarm), the three Greys outside the ship will move to get the already 
 disassembled 
 equipment into the saucer.  The fourth one will work harder to bring the 
 saucer up to 
 full operational power.   If the Ops manage to get into the hanger, the 
 three Greys will 
 open fire with omniblaster pistols (either in narrow-beam or standard 
 mode), and the 
 fourth Grey will get into the top xaser turret and start shooting at the 
 Ops.  Killing a 
 Grey or two will result in the last Greys escaping into the saucer, 
 sealing it up and 
 blowing the outer door (throwing the doors over a hundred meters away), 
 and flying 
 away at top speed, firing back into the hanger to do as much damage as 
 possible. 
 </ul> 
 <p>If the Ops move <i>very</i> quickly, they can secure the Saucer.  The Grey in 
 the top 
 turret won't switch over to the bottom turret because its field of fire 
 is blocked by the 
 equipment; within touching distance of the Saucer and a few feet 
 away, the xaser 
 can't fire and hit targets because the body of the saucer blocks the 
 weapon.  Assuming 
 Ops capture the saucer, the Company will move a team in <b>very</b> quickly to take it 
 away.  If 
 not, the Greys escape, leaving behind many confused people and several 
 bits of 
 equipment.</p>
  
 <h2>The Resolution Of Affairs</h2> 
  
 <p>Dynatronics personnel, reviewing the Navi's plans, inform Argus that 
 they can be 
 modified so that the Grey plan to use them to steal information won't 
 work.  With a few 
 doses of the Cocktail to people like Morgana and the Grey Guards, a plan 
 to break into 
 the computer market by the Greys has been thwarted.  And the Ops get 
 vacation time -- 
 four days of time to themselves.  A good reward for excellent work.</p>
  
 <h2>Characters Involved In The Adventure</h2> 
  
 <h3>Morgana Lafayette</h3> 
 <p><b>ST 11, DX 12, IQ 15, HT 10</b><br> 
 <b>Advantages:</b> Animal Empathy, Attractive Appearance, Fashion Sense, 
 Intuition, Rapid 
 Healing, Telepathy 15(Uncontrolled, only useable by Greys as a relay), 
 Unusual 
 Background (Latent Telepath), and Comfortable Wealth.<br> 
 <b>Disadvantages:</b> Delusions (Quirk, "Men love what I enjoy giving them"), 
 Dreamer, 
 Involuntary Duty (Grey Telepathic Relay), Lecherousness, Slave Mentality 
 (only vs. 
 Grey Telepathy, -20%), Weirdness Magnet.<br> 
 <b>Skills:</b> All Professional/Office type skills, Akido-14, Erotic Arts-14, 
 Savoir-Faire-15, Sex 
 Appeal-15, Guns (Pistol)-10</p> 
  
 <p>Morgana wears mostly hand-dyed outfits, usually of either Arabian or 
 Indian origin.  Her 
 personality is very sensual and she's able to project an aura of 
 feelings and sensuality 
 upon those around her.  While she wouldn't initiate violence, she will 
 defend herself. 
 She does own a .38 revolver at home, but no other weapon (and her 
 shooting is poor).</p> 
  
 <h3>Grey Guards</h3> 
 <p><b>ST 14, DX 14, IQ 12, HT 14</b><br> 
 <b>Advantages:</b> Collected and Composed, Combat Reflexes, High Pain 
 Threshold, two 
 levels Strong Will.<br> 
 <b>Disadvantages:</b> Delusion (Major, Believe that the Greys are "people"), 
 Duty (To defend 
 the Greys), Slave Mentality (only vs. Grey Telepathy).<br> 
 <b>Skills:</b> Guns (Light Automatic, TL 7)-15, Guns (Light Automatic, TL 8), 
 Karate-15.</p> 
  
 <p>There are eight Grey Guards involved in this adventure.  All of them had 
 been, in the 
 past, captured by the Greys and subjected to long-term mind control as 
 well as being 
 implanted.  They all believe that the team of four Greys in the 
 warehouse is a group of 
 government officials, and that they're working for a covert operations 
 branch of the 
 government.  Any efforts to convince the Guards that the Greys are not 
 human will be 
 rejected (short of long term psychotherapy or a combination of 
 Telerecieve and 
 Mindwipe to fix the damage).  When they're operating as "government 
 officials", they 
 are wearing TL 9 Combat Infantry Dress torso units (PD 4, DR 50 for hit 
 locations 9-11 
 and 17-18) concealed as TL 7 heavy body armor, armed with M16 assault 
 rifles.  When 
 operating as "covert officers", the team wears full Combat Infantry 
 Dress, and helmet 
 with radio communicators in them.  They are also carrying TL 9 Storm 
 Carbines (UT2) 
 loaded with AP ammo, six magazines of ammo and four concussion grenades 
 (6d 
 damage, detonate on impact, but the grenade doesn't generate 
 fragments).  To the Grey 
 Guards, they're defending the best of the United States (if a tad 
 humorless) from 
 Communist hordes/Militia fanatics/insane Islamic terrorists (take your 
 pick).</p>
