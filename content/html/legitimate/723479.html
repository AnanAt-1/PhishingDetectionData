Bring in items from home to represent your cultural background such as old pictures, recipes, maps and articles of clothing.  Use the library to locate folk tales, legends, and songs that describe or celebrate your heritage. Share the items you brought from home by placing them on display in your classroom.

Invite other classes, or families to attend.</LI></UL><P><P><B>Literary Devices:</B><UL><P><LI>Flashback in literature refers to a scene or a series of episodes that interrupts the normal sequence of events to describe an event or events that happened in the past.  Skim through Chapter two to find a flashback.  Respond to the following:</LI><UL><P><LI>What is the time period of the flashback?</LI><P><LI>What happens in the flashback?</LI><P><LI>Why is the information in the flashback important?</LI></UL><P><LI>Allusion is a reference in literature to a familiar person, place or event.  Do some research to find out about the Norse God Thor to whom Kirsti alluded when she named her cat.  Why was Thor a humorous name for the kitten?</LI></UL><UL><P><LI>A cliffhanger in literature is a device borrowed from serialized silent films in which an episode or chapter ends at a moment of heightened tension and suspense to encourage the reader to continue on in the story.  Tell about the cliff-hanger at the end of Chapter twelve.</LI><P><LI>Personification  in literature is a device in which an author grants human qualities or attributes to inanimate objects.  </LI></UL><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Dawn would creep across the Swedish farmland and coast; then it would wash little Denmark with light and move across the North Sea to wake Norway.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><UL><LI>The last section of the book is called the Afterward. Consider the information that the author gives the reader in this section.  Discuss why this section was included, what you learned by reading the section, and if there would be another effective way to include this information somewhere else in the text.</LI></UL><P><P><B>Literary Elements:</B><UL><P><LI>Create a sense chart that identifies a specific place.  Include the five senses.  Think about a special place that you once visited.  What did you see, hear, smell, taste, and feel while you were there?  Use the chart to list the things that you experienced with your senses.  Use at least one descriptive word to tell about each item.  Try to write a draft of a story about this place.</LI><P></UL><P><B>Suggested Activities:</B><UL><P><LI>Have students use classroom resource materials and media center resources to find out about when the German occupation of Copenhagen began.  Investigate the response of the people of Denmark.</LI><P><LI>Use classroom and media center resources to research Christian X, who was portrayed in the novel as a very principled, courageous man.  Have students find out about this unusual ruler.</LI><P><LI>Using a map of Europe, have students locate and label Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, France, Sweden, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea (and the part of the North Sea called Kattegat, p.16), Hillerod, and Norrebro (page 7).</LI><P><LI>Have students research the culture, economy, and history of Denmark.  Have students research and find out about places Annemarie remembered that her family enjoyed prior to the war (pages 30-31).  Have them present findings to the rest of their literature group, or to the class in a creative way.</LI><P><LI>Have students write a story, or poem that explores the meaning of bravery.  Annemarie wonders what it means to be brave.  Students can express their thoughts to Annemarie.</LI><P><LI>Annemarie sets out to deliver the package containing the handkerchief, while doing this she tells herself the story of Little Red Riding Hood.  Writers often use devices such as metaphor and allegory that help to bring a deeper meaning to their text.  Use examples of metaphor and allegory to help students understand how these devices are used.  Then, ask students to write a journal entry comparing Annemarie's experience on her mission to deliver the package to the tale of Little Red Riding Hood.  Have them share the ways that Annemarie's experience mirrors the tale.  Have students also discuss the ways it is different.</LI><P><LI>Ask students to find an image that Lois Lowry created that helps them understand the story.  Ask students to create a work of art that would help express these thoughts.</LI><P><LI>Danish boats ferried Jews to safety in Sweden from the following points on the map: Gillelje, Rungsted, Copenhagen and Mon.  Locate these places on a map and tell about the boats and people that ferried people to safety.</LI><P><LI>Have students select two characters from the story.  Draw their pictures.  Under the picture have them use descriptive language and tell about the characters, make sure that they  compare and contrast.</LI><P><LI>Students can create a poster or chart that show the elements of fiction found in <I>Number the Stars.</I> Have them present their poster in a creative way.</LI><P><LI>After each day's reading, encourage students to write one or more new things they learned from the text.</LI><P><LI>Provide students with quotes from the novel and ask them to write their own responses.</LI><P><LI>Students can design a postcard to send to Papa in Copenhagen.  Have them use descriptions from the book to draw the postcard (countryside, farm of Uncle Henrik, the seashore, or a fishing boat).  Have them write a message to Papa telling him of the trip to Uncle Henriks.  Remind the students that Nazis might intercept the mail,  and that they need to write in code. Display the finished postcards.  (Do front and back on two pieces of 3x5 oak tag.)</LI></UL><p><center><a href="../resist2.HTM#GUIDE"><img src="../../I/backbttn.gif" WIDTH=43 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0></a> <P><a href="../../I/menubar.map"><img src="../../I/menubar.gif" WIDTH=364 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0 USEMAP="#menubar" ismap></a><P><a href="../../sitemap/sitemap.htm"><img src="../../I/mapdex.gif" width=120 height=20border=0></a><p><a href="../../default.htm">A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust</a><br><font size="-1">Produced by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology,<br>College of Education, University of South Florida &copy; 2005.</font></CENTER><P><BR><P><map name="menubar"><area shape="rect" coords="01,02 76,18" href="../../timeline/timeline.htm"alt="Timeline"><area shape="rect" coords="83,01 144,19" href="../../people/people.htm"alt="People"><area shape="rect" coords="150,01 190,19" href="../../arts/arts.htm"alt="Arts"><area shape="rect" coords="198,01 271,19" href="../activity.htm"alt="Activities"><area shape="rect" coords="279,01 363,18" href="../../resource/resource.htm"alt="Resources"></map></BLOCKQUOTE></body></html>
