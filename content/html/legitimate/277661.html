<H2>NEWS</H2>
News?  Well, I'm leaving this page up for its historical significance <TT>:-)</TT>
<BR>
Please don't mail me asking "what is a floppy disk", check on <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">Wikipedia</A>.

<H2>OLDS</H2>
I moved the development page to <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=5505">SourceForge</A>.
The new URL for PenguinBackup is now <A HREF="http://PenguinBackup.sourceforge.net/">http://PenguinBackup.sourceforge.net/</A><BR>
Expect a new version (with support for the long-requested backups of Palms
with more than 2MB RAM) real soon now (tm).<P>

<B>For questions, comments, requests etc. please go to the new
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=5505">Discussion Forums</A></B>
(either "Help" if you have problems using the software, or "Open Discussion"
for general questions, or anything else).

<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
<B>PenguinBackup</B> is a single,
bootable 3.5" floppy disk which includes a complete operating
system, utilities, and communication software for all kinds of
Pilots (OS 1.x - 3.x), wrapped in a nice, easy-to-use
menu system.</P>
<P>It is intended as an emergency backup
system in case you're on the road with only your Pilot
and need to do a full restore
after a hard reset.</P>
<P>You only need to carry the PenguinBackup floppy (and a second
one holding the programs/data to restore) and can bring your Pilot
back to life with almost any plain ol' PC without the need to install
anything on it (it doesn't even need a hard drive).</P>
<P>You can also use it to do full backups on the road or install new
applications/databases (e.g. store some books in Doc format on a floppy
and install them one after the other to have something to read :-)
</P>
<IMG SRC="pb_menu.gif" ALT="Screenshot Main Menu">
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>It's also useful if you synchronize with the standard Palm Desktop
most of the time (which doesn't backup all 3rd party programs and
their databases) and would like to have a truly complete backup
just in case.  If you are one of the rare Pilot users without
an own PC, you can use PenguinBackup to occasionally do a full backup 
on any PC without having to install software on it first (and
leaving personal data around).
</P><P>
<H4>Things it can do</H4>
<UL>
<LI>full system backup/restore (including <EM>all</EM> 3rd party
applications and their databases)</LI>
<LI>install or delete a single application/database</LI>
<LI>do incremental backups</LI>
<LI>fetch a single application/database from your Pilot</LI>
<LI>amaze friends</LI>
<LI>and more...</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<B>System requirements:</B> This system should boot on everything
from a 386 to a Pentium II.  The PC should have at least 4MB RAM.
It obviously also needs a floppy disk drive and a serial or IR interface.
On the Palm[Pilot] itself, no additional software is needed.
<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="setup">Setup</A></H2>
<P>
Download the package (<A HREF="#download">see below</A>).
The zip archive contains the floppy
disk image <TT>pbackup.img</TT> and the MS-DOS <TT>rawrite.exe</TT> program 
to write the image to a floppy (note that simply using <TT>"copy"</TT>
<B>won't work!</B>).  Just start the <TT>rawrite.exe</TT> program and
have an empty floppy handy (it will prompt you for all information).
</P>
<P>
If you have access to a Linux/Unix box,
you can use <TT>dd</TT> to create the floppy:
<BR>
<TT>dd if=pbackup.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=1k</TT>
(if <TT>/dev/fd0</TT> is your 3.5" floppy).
</P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="usage">Using PenguinBackup</A></H2>
<H4>Booting</H4>
<P>Simply insert the floppy and boot the PC from it (make sure the PC's BIOS
is configured to boot from floppy).  It will boot straight into the main
menu.  You can  remove the boot disk once you got to the main menu
(you can also write-protect it).
<P>

<H4>Configuration</H4>
<P>
Before you can transfer data to/from your PalmPilot, you have
to configure the serial interface first.  Usually, you need
just two information for this: the serial interface the Pilot
is connected to (i.e. COM1, ..., COM4)
and the connection speed.
</P><P>
Configuration is done by selecting the "Basic Configuration" menu entry.
</P>

<IMG SRC="pb_speed_conf.gif" ALT="Screenshot: Serial Port Speed Selection">
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>Configuration is the same if you connect via infrared (IR).
Make sure the IR port is set in the PC's BIOS
to a serial interface (e.g. COM2), and give this interface when asked.
<BR>
For the connection speed, you probably want to go with the "fast"
setting (57600), unless you are running on a very old PC (where
you can't go faster than 9600 or 19200) or connect via IR
(19200 should work fine here).
</P>
<P>
In rare cases, when the PC's serial interfaces don't use the standard
values for interrupts and IO addresses, you'll have to configure
these values manually.  This can be done through the "Advanced
Configuration" menu point.
</P>

<H4>Usage (Backup, Restore etc.)</H4>
After configuring the interface, you can use the menu system to do
full backups (stored on a floppy in a "zip" archive), a full restore
(from a zip archive), or install a single application (.prc) or
database (.pdb) from a floppy to the Pilot.
The data stored in the zip archive can also be
accessed from a standard Unix or BillOS desktop.

<H4>Advanced Operations: the Command Shell</H4>
<P>The menu system does not cover all the possibilities of the
software.
A lot more functionality is available through the
<EM>command shell</EM>.  From there, you can directly
manipulate the file system, access floppy disks,
create ZIP archives,
and use the <TT>pilot-xfer</TT> communication
software (e.g. to fetch or delete 
a single database from the Pilot).</P>

<P>Documentation on the command shell is available
from the "Help" menu.  Some examples:
<UL>
<LI> To fetch a database "data.pdb" from a Pilot:
    <BR><TT>pilot-xfer -f data</TT>
    <BR>(note that you have to omit the .pdb extension)
<LI> To delete a program "proggy.prc" from a Pilot:
    <BR><TT>pilot-xfer -d proggy</TT>
    <BR>(note that you have to omit the .prc extension)
</UL>
</P>

The zip archive contains everything you need to set up the system.
If you want to build your own single-floppy backup system, you
can start with the root disk from the tar archive.

<H4>How does it work?</H4>
<P>
This is essentially a minimal Linux Operating System (2.0.33), 
together with a root filesystem,
the <TT>pilot-xfer</TT> software, and some tools.
The menu system is build with shell scripts
using <EM>dialog</EM>.
<BR>
When you boot the floppy, a minimal Linux kernel gets stored and
uncompressed into RAM.  Then it loads the root filesystem into
a ramdisk.
</P><P>
Note that this really is a minimal Linux system designed to fit onto
a single floppy (i.e. there is no SCSI or other harddisk driver,
no networking, no firewalls, no SMP, ...).</P><P>
If you would like to use it on a regular basis
you should probably get one of the standard Linux distributions and 
install a complete system (together with a nice desktop like 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.slac.com/pilone/kpilot_home/">KPilot</A>).
</P>

<H4>What's on the disk?</H4>
<P>
A <A HREF="contents.txt.html">full directory listing</A> is here.
</P><P>
There is also the <A HREF="PenguinBackup.conf.html">Kernel configuration file</A> if you want to know exactly what I compiled into the Kernel.
</P>

<H4>How do I build my own bootable Linux system?</H4>
Everything you need to know you can learn from the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO.html">Bootdisk-HOWTO</A>.


<H4>What is Linux?</H4>
Uhm.  For a start, have a look at
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/">linux.org</A>.
This is taken from there:
<EM><P>
Linux is a free Unix-type operating system originally
created by Linus Torvalds with the assistance of developers
around the world. Linux is an independent POSIX
implementation and includes true multitasking, virtual
memory, shared libraries, demand loading, proper memory
management, TCP/IP networking, and other features
consistent with Unix-type systems. Developed under the
GNU General Public License, the source code for Linux is
freely available to everyone.
</P>
</EM>
Linux runs on Intel, SPARC, Alpha, PowerPC, SGI, Mac, Amiga,
and there's even a port of it for the PalmPilot.

<H4>What's a PalmPilot?</H4>
You're lost.  Go away.  <TT>:-)</TT>

<H4>What about the license?</H4>
<P>
Everything on the floppy is Open Source (GNU) software.
For more information, have a look at the <A HREF="LICENSE">GNU license</A>.
</P><P>
But even though it's free, I'd appreciate an 
<A HREF="mailto:witte@acm.org?subject=PenguinBackup">e-mail</A>
or even a
<A HREF="postcard.html">postcard</A> if you like it (hint, hint).

You can also take the time to add a review or rating for the

<P>
A lot of work for 2.0 was done by Kim Alm, who rewrote the init scripts
and did a terrific job in cleaning up the root disk.  Thanks a lot Kim,
whereever you are! ;-)
</P><P>
Also, many thanks to all who tested the system, some of them since
1.0 and before (when it did not even have a name...).
