In the evening, a reception with live music was held, during which the steering box trophy was handed over to the organizers of the 2025 meeting in the UK and plans for the 2026 meeting in France were outlined.<p>Here are some photos from the 2024 Montreal meeting:<p><ul><li><a href="Montreal/37participants.jpg">The participants</a><li><a href="Montreal/GerhardM3.jpg">Montreal circle</a><li><a href="Montreal/AtOldtimerMuseum.jpg">At the JK Classic Car Museum</a><li><a href="Montreal/37insideJKclassic.jpg">Inside the museum</a><li><a href="Montreal/MontiParkAtHotel.jpg">The Montreal park at the hotel</a><li><a href="Montreal/37darova.jpg">Head to tail</a><li><a href="Montreal/37fuelSupply.jpg">High octane fuel for Monti drivers</a> <li><a href="Montreal/MontrealsAtMarienbad.jpg">Montreals at Marienbad</a><li><a href="Montreal/37chodovar.jpg">Chodovar Brewery lunch</a><li><a href="Montreal/GerhardM2.jpg">Yellow and Gold</a><li><a href="Montreal/GerhardM1.jpg">Alfetta with a Montreal heart</a><li><a href="Montreal/GerhardM4.jpg">Idyllic courtyard</a><li><a href="Montreal/YouthBrassband.jpg">Youth brass band</a><li><a href="Montreal/37handover.jpg">Handover to 2025</a><li><a href="https://rajce.net/album/O688NcqxsWsaiK1j">Photo album by Miroslav Rozum</a></ul><p>Here are some details and photos of earlier meetings:<ul><li> <a href="Montreal/2023meeting.html">2023 Montreal meeting in Milan, Italy</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2022meeting.html">2022 Montreal meeting in the Bavarian Alps, Germany</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2021meeting.html">2021 Montreal meeting in Schwarzsee, Switzerland</a><li> The 2020 Montreal meeting was postponed until 2021 because of Covid-19<li> <a href="Montreal/2019meeting.html">2019 Montreal meeting in Luxembourg</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2018meeting.html">2018 Montreal meeting in Argyll, Scotland</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2017meeting.html">2017 Montreal meeting in Rotterdam, Holland</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2016meeting.html">2016 Montreal meeting in the Dinant area, Belgium</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2015meeting.html">2015 Montreal meeting at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2014meeting.html">2014 Montreal meeting at Beaune, France</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2013meeting.html">2013 Montreal meeting at Hamburg, Germany</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2012meeting.html">2012 Montreal meeting at Lucignano, Italy</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2011meeting.html">2011 Montreal meeting at Porvoo, Finland</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2010meeting.html">2010 Montreal meeting at Vevey, Switzerland</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2009meeting.html">2009 Montreal meeting at Cascais, Portugal</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2008meeting.html">2008 Montreal meeting in Luxembourg</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2007meeting.html">2007 Montreal meeting at Cambrils, Spain</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2006meeting.html">2006 Montreal meeting at Rovigo, Italy</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2005meeting.html">2005 Montreal meeting at B&auml;ckaskog Castle, Sweden</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2004meeting.html">2004 Montreal meeting at Trehafod, Wales</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2003meeting.html">2003 Montreal meeting at Interlaken, Switzerland</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2002meeting.html">2002 Montreal meeting at Hann.

The salient points were:<p>1. Pre-convention Alfa driving tours began in Kingston Ontario on Monday 10 July, and ended at the hotel in Montreal on Wednesday 12 July in the afternoon. These tours included sightseeing and stops at many unique and interesting Canadian landmarks.<br>2. Thursday 13 July included an Autocross (solo racing with cones) for those so inclined, or you could use the day to enjoy some of the available pre-arranged tours and activities in the city. In the early evening, there was a traditional meal at a rustic maple syrup making farm.<br>3. On Friday 14 July, there was a special Montreal Owners brunch at 10h00, followed by a fun 'Gimmick Rally', set to include many of the wonderful landmarks of Montreal, including a (slow speed) driving tour of the Formula One track, several great photo opportunities, and both city and country driving. In the evening, there was a traditional Quebec-style cook-out, featuring live music and meats and vegetables cooked over coals outdoors.<br>4. Saturday 15 July was a day for selecting from a range of interesting driving tours, enjoying some track time at a local racetrack (time trials), or for your own independent tours and activities in the city. During the afternoon there were some technical seminars at the hotel, and the convention banquet was held at the hotel from 19h00 to 22h00.<br>5. On Sunday 16 July, participants gathered from 08h00 to 12h00 at a beautiful location for a judged Concorso at which the Alfa Romeo Montreal was the featured car. Other Italian cars also joined in separate groupings, and all the awards were made during the Awards Brunch from 12h00 to 14h00 before the convention ended.<p>The contact information for the convention chairman, Alex Sandor Csank, is Tel (+1) 514 7719513, Email <a href="mailto:alfaromeodriveralex (at) gmail.com">alfaromeodriveralex (at) gmail.com</a>.<p>Several Montreals attended the 2009 AROC National Convention, which was held in Portland, Oregon, from 15 to 19 July. <a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> from Simi Valley, California, made a <a href="http://www.alfagene.net/">7800km round trip</a> in his Montreal to visit the convention.<p>At least 4 Montreals attended the 2007 AROC National Convention which was held in Detroit, Michigan, from 1 to 5 August. The participation was organized by  <a href="mailto:alfapassion (at) videotron.ca">Jimmy Cornet</a>, who brought his Montreal from Montreal, Canada, to the event and received an award for it.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a> <p><hr><p><a name="Origins"><h4>Origins</h4></a><p><ul><li> Marcello Gandini's inspiration - <a href="Montreal/Miura.jpg">The Lamborghini Miura (1966)</a>.<li> Conception of the side windows - <a href="Montreal/MiuraDoor.jpg">The Miura door styling</a>.<li> Conception of the air vents - <a href="Montreal/CanguroSlots.jpg">The Alfa Romeo Canguro (1964)</a>.<li> Conception of the headlamp shelters - <a href="Montreal/Porsche911Spider.jpg">The Porsche 911 Spider/Roadster (1966)</a>.<li> A noble engine pedigree - <a href="Montreal/T332.jpg">The Alfa Romeo Type 33/2 V8-2l Sport-proto (1969)</a>.<li> Race-bred motor - <a href="Montreal/33Daytona.jpg">The Daytona 33/2 at the Alfa Romeo Museum (Arese)</a>.<li> 270 bhp at 9600 rpm from 2 litres - <a href="Montreal/33engine.jpg">The 33/2 Sport-proto engine</a>.<li> Cutaway view - <a href="Montreal/33cutaway.jpg">Engine drawing by G.

This carried out degreasing, zinc phosphate coating and electro-deposition of the undercoat before final spray painting by hand.<p>In keeping with late sixties fashion and the character of the car (a racing engine dressed in a gala evening gown?), Alfa offered the Montreal in a <a href="Montreal/ColChart.jpg">range</a> of flamboyant <a href="Montreal/Finish.html">body colours</a>.  One <a href="Montreal/ColorChartCover.jpg">colour chart</a> included the <a href="Montreal/ZMchart.jpg">finishes</a> offered for the <a href="Montreal/ZMlist.jpg">Montreal and the GT Zagato</a>. Bright orange (AR601/602) was a popular choice in the early sunshine years, ordered more frequently than classic Italian red (AR521).  The colour AR825, poetically named by Alfa Romeo "Luci del bosco metallizzato", has been incorrectly described as everything from olive to silver.  It was in fact metallic dark brown.  Alfa Romeo also used the name for the metallic light brown colour <a href="Montreal/AR524finish.jpg">AR524</a>, which is not included in the Montreal colour charts but was available to special order. Later Alfa Romeo re-used the name for other body colours such as AR556.<p>The Glasurit formulations corresponding to a number of Alfa Romeo paint codes are available through their <a href="http://color-online.glasurit.com/?language=8">Color-Online</a> facility. <a href="http://www.standox.com/portal/">Standox</a> formulations for the most common Montreal paint finishes are available by their <a href="http://cdb.sxcolor.info/en/AdvancedSearch.mvc/grid?companyName=alfa%20romeo&useYear=1972">Online Search</a> facility.

O (+Fl. Cl.) M6388 12/99) is a good match for the "Grigio fumo opaco" finish which was originally applied to the door sills and rear bumper area of the Montreal. [To Juhani: This may be an error, since M6388 is 7229, while 7228 is listed as "Tritongrau"]. When their cars were repainted, many owners finished these areas with the same colour as the rest of the bodywork.   <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Upholstery"><h4>Upholstery</h4></a><p>Bertone fitted leather upholstery to only a few Montreals to special order, at a <a href="Montreal/1976list.jpg">supplementary cost</a> in Germany in 1976 of DEM 1580. In most cars the front seats were covered with velour fabric. The surrounds and backs of the seats, the interior of the storage compartments, the door panels and the handbrake and gear lever gaiters were all of "Texalfa", a synthetic leatherette.

In <a href="Montreal/DreamCars.jpg">"Dream Cars: The Best Cars in the World"</a>, published in 1997 by George Weidenfeld & Nicolson, author Andrew Frankel includes the Montreal in his catalogue of the 50 most desirable cars in the history of motoring. The Montreal is the first car cited in "My Dad wished he had one of those", ISBN 9780340 963241, published in 2008 by Hodder & Stoughton. Authors Richard Porter and Giles Chapman say "... model Yasmin Le Bon bought one, proving that her taste in cars was better than her taste in husbands."<p>In 1992, <a href="http://www.giorgionadaeditore.it/">Giorgio Nada Editore</a> published a <a href="Montreal/Book.jpg">book</a> about the Montreal by Luigi Giuliani (ISBN 8879110721) but this is now out of print. It is a 96-page paperback in Italian language. This volume is one of the "Cars that made History" series, some of which eventually appear in English translation, but Nada inform me that they do not have plans for an English version at present. However, Australian Alfista <a href="mailto:mstreet (at) pcug.org.au">Malcolm Street</a> has made an excellent <a href="http://www.users.on.net/~mstreet/montreal.htm">translation into English</a> of the entire text of Luigi Giuliani's book including figure captions. (Revised version, April 1999). This remarkable work, undertaken by an amateur as a part-time project while learning Italian, complements the original text and illustrations and opens the book to the wider English-language readership.<p>A well-illustrated 33-page <a href="Montreal/100anniMg.jpg">booklet</a> on the Alfa Romeo Montreal was published by <a href="http://www.deagostini.it/">De Agostini</a> in the series "100 Anni di Italia in Automobile". In addition to an article on the Montreal "Vera opera d'arte" (A True Work of Art), the publication contains a brief review of some of the events of 1973 and a very short biography of the Montreal's mechanical design engineer, the late Giuseppe Busso.<p>In January 1992 <a href="http://www.giorgionadaeditore.it/">Giorgio Nada Editore</a> published the well-illustrated 416-page book <a href="Montreal/BertoneBook.jpg">"Bertone"</a> by Luciano Greggio, ISBN 8879110667, Italian/English text, ITL 180,000. This book is now out of print.<p>A beautifully illustrated <a href="Montreal/Bertone.jpg">"Nuccio Bertone Portfolio"</a> was published in English and Italian as a supplement to the September-October 1989 edition (Vol. 29, No. 5) of the periodical "La Manovella e Ruote a Raggi".  Copies may still be obtainable from Carrozzeria Bertone.<p>A 1972 Montreal is one of the 12 cars featured in <a href="Montreal/alfazioso.jpg">"alfazioso"</a> by Gianfilippo Salvetti, published in November 1998 by Fucina Edizioni (Italian and English text, ITL 80,000). The car illustrated (AR1425697) has been part of the Alfa Blue Team since November 1994.<p>Additional illustrations of Montreal bodies being fabricated at the Bertone plant at Caselle and painted and trimmed at Grugliasco were published in "Style Auto, Architettura della Carrozzeria", No. 30, January-February 1972.  Shrink-wrapped back numbers of the hardcover English text version of this issue were available from <a href="http://www.libreriadellautomobile.it">La Libreria dell'Automobile</a> for ITL 12,000 but are now difficult to find at a reasonable price.  The English translation is mediocre but the Italian text version is no longer available.  This issue of the periodical contains as an insert a folded 48 x 69 cm sheet reproducing a set of 1:10 scale Alfa Romeo drawings on one side and Bertone drawings on the other.  The two-colour Alfa Romeo drawings include three elevations and a plan of the Montreal unitary chassis with engine, drive train and suspension.  Here is an example of <a href="Montreal/Engineside.jpg">part of the side elevation showing the engine</a>.  The Bertone black-and-white drawings show the corresponding views of the Montreal body with numerous profiles.  Here is an example of the <a href="Montreal/Tailform.jpg">rear part of the side elevation</a>.<p>Luigi Fusi (<a href="Montreal/Fusi.jpg">"All Alfa Romeo cars from 1910"</a>, 3rd edition published in 1978 by Emmeti Grafica s.a.s., Milan) gives a short description of the Montreal on pp. 705-710.<p>A pink Montreal was chosen as the <a href="Montreal/ChinaMonti.jpg">front cover illustration</a> for Volume 5 "Transportation by land and sea" of the set of popular science books ("Shijiekepuhualang") published in Chinese by Zhe Jiang Educational Press in June 1997.<p>The entertaining and informative <a href="Montreal/Bible.jpg">"Alfa Romeo Owner's Bible"</a> by the late Pat Braden, ISBN 0837607078, published in 1994 by Robert Bentley, Cambridge, Massachusetts, although containing few specific references to the Montreal, contains a great deal of relevant material.

Pat's book <a href="Montreal/GiuliaHR.jpg">"Alfa Romeo Giulia: History and Restoration"</a>, ISBN 0879385294, published in 1991 by Motorbooks International, Osceola, Wisconsin, also includes a few pages on the Montreal.

Publication No. 1597 (5000 printed)<li> French: "<a href="Montreal/ManualF.jpg">Conduite et Entretien</a>". Publication No. 1598 (700 printed)<li> English: "<a href="Montreal/ManualE.jpg">Instruction Book</a>". Publication No. 1601 (1600 printed)<li> German: "<a href="Montreal/ManualD.jpg">Betriebsanleitung und Wartung</a>". Publication No. 1603 (2000 printed)<p></ul>Minor differences will be found as a result of editing which occurred between the publication of the various editions.  For example, a pump bleed screw was added to the cooling system diagram on p. 57 of the December 1971 English version, altering system component references 16, 17 and adding 18. But the associated text was not fully updated, so that block drain plug 18 is referred to in the draining instructions as 17 (which is now the pump itself). An error in the tolerance of the distributor contact-breaker gap (which should be &plusmn;0.03 mm) in the Italian and English owner manuals was corrected in the French and German versions.   <p>In 1971 the Italian version of the Montreal owner manual could be purchased for USD 2.50. Today originals in mint condition fetch over USD 100. Reproductions of the English version are available from <a href="http://www.mercianmanuals.co.uk/">Mercian Manuals</a> for GBP 16.76. The reproduction is of good quality apart from the wiring diagram, which has been scaled down by 65%, making the wire gauge and cable colour codes largely illegible. A reproduction manual can also be supplied for USD 44.95 by <a href="http://www.books4cars.com/">Voss Motors</a>. It is of somewhat poorer quality.<p>A CD-ROM with a scan of the French owner manual can be supplied by <a href="mailto:helfenraoul (at) yahoo.com">Raoul Helfen</a>.<p>User instructions for the optional <a href="Montreal/ACinstns.pdf">air conditioning system</a> were given in supplementary leaflets published in early 1972 (Publication No. 1905, 5500 printed, for the Italian version; No. 1907, 2000 printed, for the English version; No. 1908, 3000 printed, for the German version). A 17-page "Air Conditioning System" manual (Publication No. 1969, 1000 printed in October 1972) gives general directions for checking and recharging the system which are applicable to the units fitted to the Montreal, 2000 and Alfetta. <p>Supplements to the Montreal owner manuals indicating <a href="Montreal/RadioSuppl.pdf">how to install a radio</a> were published in Italian (Publication No. 1823, 6/71, 5000 printed), French (Publication No. 1850, 11/71, 3000 printed), English (Publication No. 1851, 12/71, 1600 printed) and German (Publication No. 1852, 10/71, 2800 printed).<p>The Montreal owner documents were supplied in a <a href="Montreal/DocPouch.jpg">synthetic pouch</a> on which "Alfa Romeo" is printed in gilt lettering of mediocre quality.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Carnet"><h4>Service carnet</h4></a><p>Alfa Romeo Montreal service carnets were printed in several languages (<a href="Montreal/CarnetI.jpg">Libretto di Servizio</a>, <a href="Montreal/CarnetE.jpg">Service Coupon Book</a>, <a href="Montreal/Carnet.jpg">Carnet de Service</a>, <a href="Montreal/CarnetD.jpg">Kundendienst Scheckheft</a>) by Arti Grafiche Milanesi in March-June 1971. A revised version was printed in March 1972. These little carnets contained the following items:<ul><li> 2 sales record forms which the vendor removed and returned to Alfa Romeo for customer registration. The registered owner received copies of the periodical "Il Quadrifoglio".<li> The vehicle pre-delivery check slip. This was usually removed from the carnet by the dealer and put in the car.<li> The 6-month guarantee certificate. The name of the first owner and the stamp of the vendor can be found on this card.<li> Coupons for the free services A at 700-1200 km and B at 5000-6000 km. The gearbox oil and the differential oil, as well as the engine oil, were to be replaced at each of these services.<li> The acceptance certificate for the vehicle and its equipment. This was retained by the vendor after signature by the purchaser of the car.<li> The guarantee conditions and notes on the use of the service coupons.<li> Notes on the checks to be made at 500 km intervals and items requiring occasional lubrication.<li> 7 coupons for the subsequent services at 6000 km intervals from 12000 to 48000 km.

Additional technical and service information for some of the component systems of the vehicle was published in several languages in a number of separate documents (e.g., "<a href="Montreal/CDI.pdf">Montreal: Capacitor discharge transistorized ignition</a>", DIASS No. 1643 for the English version; "<a href="Montreal/FrenchCDImanual.pdf">Montreal: L'allumage &eacute;lectronique &agrave; condensateur</a>", DIASS No. 1642 for the French version, both published in April 1971).<p>A <a href="Montreal/Shop.jpg">Montreal "Shop Manual"</a> has been compiled by Mercian Manuals which comprises a collection of reproductions of the most relevant of these separate documents. It is available directly from <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~mercman/">Mercian Manuals</a> (GBP 23.45) or via suppliers such as <a href="http://www.motorbooks.co.uk">Motor Books C&amp;SC</a> (GBP 24.95), <a href="http://www.millhousebooks.com/">Mill House Books</a> (GBP 25.95), <a href="http://www.ewacars.com/">EWA Cars</a> (USD 44.10) or <a href="http://www.books4cars.com/">Voss Motors</a> (USD 49.95).

Original manuals (Ref 1255 751 101) may still be available from some national service stations of <a href="http://www.zf-group.de/special2.asp?lang=1">ZF Friedrichshafen AG</a>. Alfa Romeo's 44-page repair manual for the gearbox was published in several languages (DIASS No. 1853 for the Italian version - September 1972, DIASS No. 1854 for the <a href="Montreal/GboxManF.jpg">French version</a> - February 1974, DIASS No. 1856 for the German version - August 1973).<p>A 39-page "Alfa Romeo Spica Fuel Injection Shop Manual", ISBN 0-87938-290-2, was published in 1988 by Motorbooks International Publishers & Wholesalers Inc, PO Box 2, 729 Prospect Avenue, Osceola, WI 54020, USA. It is now out of print. Tests, adjustments, regular maintenance and troubleshooting are covered, but the information is only partly applicable to the Montreal, and this is not a manual for overhauling or rebuilding the injection pump.<p>More comprehensive information on the Spica fuel injection system is available in the Owners Technical Notes Series published by the US Alfa Romeo Owners Club. The 171-page dossier, which was edited by the late Fred Di Matteo and John Hertzman, is available for USD 20 (+ postage) from the Club Librarian, <a href="mailto:alfalibrary (at) optonline.net">Jim Neill</a>.  It can be supplied to non-members of AROC. Jim can also supply back issues of the AROC "Alfa Owner" carrying articles by Joe Benson on "Opening the injection pump". Part 1 "Familiarization" was published in the April 1978 issue (Vol. 21, No. 4) and Part 2 "Repairs and maintenance" in the May 1978 issue (Vol. 21, No. 5). <p><p>When consulting documentation for <a href="Montreal/4cylSpica.jpg">4-cylinder Spica injectors</a>, note that references to the long link concern the short link on Montreal pumps, which have a more complex mechanism for operating the throttle butterflies.

The catalogue, which runs to 530 pages, contains exploded views of the subassemblies and lists almost all the components which were assigned separate Part Nos. Here is an <a href="Montreal/TAV.100.jpg">example page</a> from the catalogue. The parts are identified in Italian, French, English, German and Spanish and the designations of external suppliers (ATE, Bertone, Bosch, Carello, Fispa, Jaeger, Marelli, Spica, ZF, etc) are also given where appropriate. The catalogue comprises mechanical, electrical and coachwork sections and a numerical index. A copy can be downloaded <a href="FullPartsCat.pdf">here</a>. (27 MB pdf)<p>A number of revised tables were introduced in September 1973 and the revised sheets were supplied to Alfa Romeo dealers to allow their copies of the March 1971 catalogue to be updated. A Revision Index (<a href="Montreal/RevIndex1c.jpg">Page 4/1</a> and <a href="Montreal/RevIndex2c.jpg">Page 4/2</a>) was printed, but 9-1973 versions of the catalogue pages which I have highlighted in yellow in the Index have so far not been found!  Finally the revised parts catalogue was printed in February 1975.<p>In 1971, the spare parts catalogue was sold for USD 12. As examples of pricing, "Revues Automobiles Librairie" in Paris offered a photocopy of all the sections for FRF 300, while in recent years originals were sold at the Bern and Fribourg OTMs for CHF 100.<ul><li> <a href="http://www.haeckner.com/">G. H&auml;ckner</a> offers a good quality reproduction of the parts catalogue for EUR 65. (Part No. 992024).<li> <a href="http://www.mercianmanuals.co.uk/">Mercian Manuals</a> offer a reproduction parts catalogue for GBP 33.60. The quality is somewhat mediocre, however, with several pages missing (including the main index, p. 3, and the entire numerical index, pp. 511 - 529), others clipped or out of sequence, and a very few unreadable.<li> <a href="http://www.millhousebooks.com/">Mill House Books</a> can also supply this reproduction parts catalogue for GBP 32.95.<li> <a href="Montreal/VHB.html">VHB</a> offer a 92-page illustrated Montreal spare parts catalogue for FRF 120. The drawings are somewhat more compressed than in the Alfa Romeo parts catalogue, and the parts are identified by catalogue Page No. and Drawing No., not by Alfa Romeo Part No. Here's an <a href="Montreal/Parts.GIF">example page</a> showing some door parts (at low resolution, just to give you an idea).<li> <a href="http://www.international-auto.com">International Auto Parts</a> offer copies of the Montreal parts catalogue, instruction book (owner's manual) and technical characteristics document as a set for USD 87.<li> <a href="http://www.books4cars.com/">Voss Motors</a> offer a reproduction Montreal parts catalogue for USD 62.95.<li> <a href="Montreal/Schiff.html">Schiff European Automotive Literature</a> offers reprints of the Montreal Mechanical Spare Parts Catalogue and Bodywork Spare Parts Catalogue sections for USD 95 each.</ul>The Montreal air conditioner parts catalogue (DIASS Publication No. 2125) is a separate 21-page document with its own numerical index. The first edition was published in December 1973 and a revised version (2125/R1) in September 1974. A copy of the air conditioner parts catalogue is included with the Mercian "Shop Manual" and some reproduction Montreal parts catalogues. It can be dowloaded <a href="AirConCat.pdf">here</a>.<p>A "Performance Options" catalogue for 105-series cars was published by Alfa Romeo Inc, Newark NJ, USA. (Publication No. 104, revisions from November 1971 to February 1977). The catalogue lists numerous performance parts, some standard and others special production, which were normally stocked in the ARI parts centres during the 1970s. A special racing version (105.64.04.030.99) of the Montreal Spica pump is listed, together with the Autodelta cylinder heads (105.55.01.046.99 right, 105.55.01.053.99 left) and alternative 670 g connecting rods (105.59.02.020.01). Other references to the Montreal concern the use of Montreal parts, such as the Bosch CD ignition system and the differential sump, on other 105-series cars. Reproductions of the catalogue may be purchased from the AROC Technical Library (<a href="mailto:alfalibrary (at) optonline.net">Jim Neill</a>) for USD 20 plus shipping (USD 25 within the US).<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="CDROMs"><h4>CD-ROMs</h4></a><p><ul><li> A CD-ROM containing scans of the Montreal parts catalogue can be supplied by <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a>.

Contrary to general belief very few parts are common to both the Montreal and the Giulia.  When procuring drive and suspension parts be aware that some Montreal components can look the same as parts for 4-cylinder 105-series Alfa Romeo cars but are in fact made from stronger materials to support the greater loading.  <ul><li> Some Alfa Romeo parts vendors have a <b>Trascodifica microfiche</b> which gives the later (Group code) equivalents of a range of earlier (AR code) Part Nos. For example, the Montreal brake master cylinder/reservoir/servo assembly (105.64.45.022.05) is equivalent to 60716172.  The existence of such a later GR number does not guarantee that the part can actually be supplied by Fiat today. Most 105.64 parts correspond to the GR code group from 60715562 to 60717046 inclusive.  <br>The Part No. of the complete 4-part microfiche set itself is 60495490 and the 2nd edition was published in April, 1990.  This provides for the translation of AR codes to GR (and a few recodified GR/R) codes and <i>vice versa</i>.  Fiche 1/4 suffices for the translation of Montreal AR codes to GR codes.<p>  <li> Here is a list of a few Part No. equivalencies which may be useful:<p><table border=3 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=3 width="90%"  ><tr>			<th align=CENTER><font  color="red">Description</font></th>			<th align=CENTER><font  color="red">AR Part No.</font></th>			<th align=CENTER><font  color="red">GR Part No.</font></th></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Air filter elements (pair)</font></td>			<td>105.64.08.011.00/20</td>			<td>607.157.68</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Spica injector oil filter</font></td>			<td>105.64.04.082.00</td>			<td>607.156.83</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Main fuel filter</font></td>			<td >105.50.04.600.00</td>			<td>607.150.10</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Tank fuel filter (later felt type)</font></td>			<td >105.64.32.026.02</td>			<td>607.161.30</td></tr><tr>			<td><font color="#000000">Contact breaker (long)</font></td>			<td >105.64.05.011.03/01</td>			<td >607.157.26</td></tr><tr>			<td><font color="#000000">Contact breaker (short)</font></td>			<td >105.64.05.011.03/02</td>			<td >607.157.27</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Spica drive belt</font></td>			<td>105.55.04.312.00</td>			<td>607.153.27</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Alternator drive belt</font></td>			<td>105.55.02.103.01</td>			<td >607.152.68</td></tr><tr>			<td><font color="#000000">Head gasket (right bank)</font></td>			<td >105.55.01.508.04</td>			<td >607.152.53</td></tr><tr>			<td><font color="#000000">Head gasket (left bank)</font></td>			<td >105.55.01.508.05</td>			<td >607.152.54</td></tr><tr>			<td><font color="#000000">Brake pump and servo unit</font></td>			<td >105.64.45.022.05</td>			<td >607.161.72</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">ATE brake pump only</font></td>			<td >105.64.45.020.00?</td>			<td >605.172.01</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Clutch disc</font></td>			<td >105.64.12.032.03</td>			<td >607.157.82</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Spica thermostatic actuator</font></td>			<td>105.64.04.048.00</td>			<td>607.156.63</td></tr><tr>			<td><font color="#000000">Capacitor discharge ignition unit</font></td>			<td >105.64.65.116.00</td>			<td >607.170.18</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">External rear view mirror</font></td>			<td>105.64.61.017.00</td>			<td >607.167.22</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Bertone "Torino" emblem</font></td>			<td>105.64.61.210.00/01</td>			<td >607.167.43</td></tr><tr>			<td align=LEFT><font color="#000000">Retainer for Bertone emblem</font></td>			<td>105.64.61.210.00/02</td>			<td >607.167.44</td></tr><tr></table><p><li> <a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> has provided an <a href="Montreal/PartNoXref95.xls">Excel spreadsheet file</a> (1.7 MB) of an OCR scan of a book listing Alfa Romeo Part Nos. by GR code and AR code. However, the book lists only 212 105.64 Part Nos. compared with over 1500 on the Trascodifica microfiche. The origin and date and of this book are not known (information welcome!).<p><li> While the majority of Montreal parts are specific to the vehicle, a small number are common with other 105/115 series and earlier Alfa Romeo cars. Examples include the main oil filter (105.55.06.030.01), the Bonaldi brake hydraulic fluid reservoir (105.48.45.050.00) and the Carello side turning indicators (105.48.65.015.00, /01), which were fitted to many other models, and the heater assembly (105.48.57.004.02), which was also used for the 1750 Berlina and the 1750 and 2000 GTV models. <li> In addition, a very few parts developed for the Montreal and prefixed 105.64 were subsequently fitted to other Alfa Romeo models. Examples include the external rear view mirror (105.64.61.017.00), stop light switch (105.64.65.177.01) and road hazard warning light switch (105.64.65.006.00), fitted to many models, and the wood-rimmed Hellebore steering wheel (105.64.23.051.00), also fitted to the 2000 Berlina.<li> On the other hand a few 105.64 parts were never fitted to the Montreal although they were used in some other models. An example is the 105.64.65.048.00 ventilator fan rocker switch, which was fitted to some 1750 and 2000 Spiders. (The Montreal has a different rotary one). <li> Some parts cross-references can be traced with the aid of the illustrated 252-page <a href="Montreal/ShortCat.jpg">Alfa Romeo Short Spare Parts Catalogue</a> (Catalogo Rapido Ricambi, Publication No. 2235), although it does not specifically mention the Montreal.  Part descriptions are given only in Italian although notes are given also in English, French and German. A separate numerical index was printed.

The model, which was created in about 100 hours of work using <a href="http://www.zmodeler.com/">Zmodeler</a> software, is destined for eventual use in the <a href="http://www.nkzone.com">netKar</a> racing simulator. To meet the netKar poly-limit, Fred modelled the Montreal body by about <a href="Montreal/Wireframe.jpg">5100 polygons (triangles)</a>.<p>The Montreal model was based on the 1997 Hot Cars file card shown in the "Cards" section, supplemented by other pictures to make the skin, head and tail lights, etc. In addition to Zmodeler, the model can be <a href="Montreal/3Dmonti1.jpg">rendered</a> with better reflections and shadows etc with 3DStudio Max, by graphic designer Alessandro Piemontesi "Outrunner". It can be stretched, zoomed and rotated for <a href="Montreal/3Dmonti2.jpg">viewing at any angle</a>.<p>While studying automotive design at Coventry University, <a href="mailto:karlalansanders at yahoo.com">Karl Sanders</a> designed a new Montreal concept as a final year project in 2008-2009.

Nicholas  also used the images from the Hot Cars card as blueprints to build up the basic model of the car and texture it. Once the simple low-polygon shape had been completed he added more detail, such as fenders and complex bodywork curves. Finally he added the wheels, also textured and sized using the original images.<p>As part of a <a href="http://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be">Digital Arts and Entertainment School</a> exam requirement, <a href="mailto:lukas_van_daele (at) hotmail.com">Lukas Van Daele</a> has created an imaginative rendering of a <a href="Montreal/WinterMontreal.jpg">Montreal equipped for extreme winter conditions</a>.

It is available printed on three different types of paper in A2, A3 or 50x70 cm size.<p>To mark the 40th anniversary of the presentation of the Alfa Romeo Montreal at the 1970 Geneva Salon, talented industrial design student <a href="mailto:dvarennadesign at hotmail.com">Davide Varenna</a> created a design for a <a href="Montreal/Dvarenna1.jpg">modern version of the car</a> that maintains many of the original styling clues.<p>Davide says, "My aim was to design the heir to one of the loveliest two-seaters ever created in Arese. One of the goals I set myself from the start, which I was working on my research sketches, was to include a number of characteristic elements of the original car (such as the NACA duct on the bonnet and the six slits in the side), to make the link immediately obvious. Because I was fascinated by its proportions and characteristic aggressive look, I tried to design a car with the same strong impact, while I drastically modified its features to adapt them to the changes that have taken place in car styling in the last 40 years.<p>The front plays an important role in recreating the look of the original car, with its delicate, cutting headlights, which are emphasised by the small air intake just above them. This is the first reference to the original Montreal: instead of the "lid" that covered the upper part of the headlights, there are now two slits which continue down to the lower part of the front, after a sharp edge level with the wheel arch rib. Unlike the latest Alfas, the shield has been lowered to adapt to the horizontal development of the front view, which is also underlined by the size of the bumpers which convey great dynamism. The profile of the new Montreal is very clean, with the long front rib that smoothly guides the eye to the rear end with its muscular shoulders that come to a sudden close in the cut-off tail.<p>Here we find <a href="Montreal/Dvarenna2.jpg">other references to the past</a>, like the dual central exhaust pipes, "Alfa Romeo" written in upper case letters and the dark strip that makes the car wider, emphasising its sportiness. The delicate light clusters underline the family resemblance with other Alfa models, but in a way also the lines of a Lamborghini, just as the Montreal of the past revealed elements of the Miura, also designed by Marcello Gandini. This is a car that returns with the same spirit as its ancestor and with the ambition to relaunch the Italian brand in America, thanks to a powerful V8 engine (just like the earlier Montreal), plenty of muscle and a name that clearly conjures up the new world."<p>Davide's drawings are made using both freehand and digital techniques. First with pens, pencils and markers, and then with Photoshop to colour and improve the sketches. In 2010 his Alfa Montreal design was exhibited at the Geneva Salon and the Novegro Exhibition Center in Milan.<p>In 1970 Bruno Betti created a number of different versions of a very detailed <a href="Montreal/Bcutaway.jpg">cutaway drawing of the Montreal</a> which were published in "Quattroruote", "Autocar", "Moteurs" and "The Cutaway Collection". Here is a <a href="Montreal/A3cutaway.jpg">larger version</a> (1.3M) scaled for an A3 printer.<p>Each year the international autotechnical bureau Olyslager Organisation B.V., Amersfoort, The Netherlands, commissions one artist's rendering of a famous automobile.

These well-illustrated documents include several views of an early vehicle including an 83 cm wide <a href="Montreal/Brochure3p.jpg">3-page spread foldout</a>. Sectional drawings of several major components of the car are included as well as internal views of the cabin. The photography in all the brochures was the work of G. Jung and Michele Saluzzo.<p>The somewhat rarer earliest versions, dated December 1970, had illustrations relating the Montreal to its Type 33/2 Sport-proto origin (<a href="Montreal/Brochure33.jpg">The Montreal's heart is that of the "33"</a>) and showed an unmatriculated vehicle without front spoiler.  One illustration apparently shows a <a href="Montreal/BrochureRHD.jpg">RHD Montreal</a> but as no such vehicle had been built in 1970 this is probably due to lateral inversion of the photograph to suit the page layout. In a later ('R') revision of the brochure (usually dated February 1973 or March 1974) some of the photography was modified, the Type 33 illustrations were removed, and the Montreal was shown in a <a href="Montreal/Brochure2p.jpg">2-page spread</a> with a spoiler, an Italian export registration and the <a href="Montreal/Torino.jpg">red and blue/white chequered Bertone emblem</a>.<p>The December 1970 brochures were printed on heavy stock by Stampa STIEM of San Donato Milanese.  The later versions were produced by a variety of printers including Stampa A.G. Grisetti s.r.l., Stampa Ripalta - Milano and Stampa Amilcare Pizzi S.p.A. - Cinisello Balsamo (Milano).<p>The Montreal was also illustrated in colour brochures covering the range of models offered by national importers such as <a href="Montreal/Sbrochure.jpg">Alfa Romeo Svenska AB</a> in Sweden and <a href="Montreal/UKbrochure.jpg">Alfa Romeo (G.B.) Ltd</a> in the UK. In 1975, common illustrations were adopted for the <a href="Montreal/Ebrochure.jpg">English brochure</a>, the <a href="Montreal/Fbrochure.jpg">French/Belgian brochure</a> and the <a href="Montreal/Dbrochure.jpg">German brochure</a>, only the language of the text being changed.

This small dossier, which can still be found with auto documentation vendors, contained in a brown folder nine A4 sheets describing the merits and technical specifications of the vehicle and a set of black-and-white photographs of it.  The <a href="Montreal/PressKit.jpg">studio photography</a> and <a href="Montreal/PressKit2.jpg">location shots</a> (probably the work of renowned Milan photographer Michele Saluzzo) were of a high standard; the English translation of the text was not. <p>On the day (12 March 1970) that the Geneva Salon opened to the public, Alfa Romeo Inc, Newark NJ, USA, released a US version of the press kit (PR-70-6) with a 2-page introduction and 4-page description of the Montreal engine, including specifications in imperial units. The introduction contained the remark "It is interesting to note that these headlights are in accordance with U.S.A. height from ground specifications". <p>Bertone issued their own shorter Montreal press release with several black-and-white <a href="Montreal/Bertone1.jpg">photographs</a> showing different views of an early production vehicle with no front spoiler.  The Alfa Romeo Montreal coachwork was also featured in <a href="Montreal/Styling.jpg">advertisements for Bertone</a> themselves. Additional outdoor shots showed the Montreal in <a href="Montreal/InNature.jpg">natural</a> and <a href="Montreal/StatelyHome.jpg">stately home</a> settings. <p>While the Montreal was frequently reviewed by the specialist press during the early 1970's, Alfa Romeo published rather few <a href="Montreal/Venice2.jpg">advertising illustrations</a> for it. The slogan "A dream car come true" was used in <a href="Montreal/Ad.GIF">early text advertisements</a>. Following the appearance of a Montreal at the <a href="Montreal/2blondes.jpg">London Motor Show</a> at Earls Court in October 1970, a <a href="Montreal/NoWaiting.jpg">Thomson & Taylor advertisement</a> suggested that the car was available immediately. However, deliveries to customers did not start until well into 1971.<p>Alfa Romeo's subsidiary in Germany published some creative advertising:<ul><li> <a href="Montreal/3468a.jpg">DM 3,468</a>. (That was only the tax!)<li> <a href="Montreal/35000.jpg">Can you understand men who will spend DM 35,000 on a car?</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2points2.jpg">The most beautiful connection between 2 points is - an Alfa Romeo</a><li> <a href="Montreal/2points.jpg">(On wet roads, too)</a></ul><p>A <a href="Montreal/SafetyAd.jpg">1972 advertisement</a> belittled the safety claims of rival car manufacturers and stated that there are only good and not-so-good vehicles, a good automobile being a safe one.<p>In France, Alfa Romeo advertised the Montreal with <a href="Montreal/ARFranceAd.jpg">much latin poetry</a> and described it as a "Man's machine", quite the opposite of a boy racer's cabriolet.<p>Alfa Romeo in Switzerland described the car in somewhat less lyrical terms as <a href="Montreal/ARSvizzeraAd.jpg">one of the best things that can be obtained for money</a>. The bottom line extols the gentleman's GT concept: "An extraordinary sports car doesn't have to be a rude fire-spitting monster".<p>Some dealer advertisements were also published in <a href="Montreal/Hexagon.jpg">England</a> and <a href="Montreal/Advert.jpg">Germany</a> but almost all such publicity ceased in 1975.  In 1972 one German agent offered a DEM 37,000 package deal of an Alfa Romeo Montreal and a Honda CB750 motorcycle as "<a href="Montreal/WeberPackage.jpg">Something Extraordinary for Men</a>". The Montreal was no longer advertised at the Geneva salons in 1976 and 1977 and, in order to liquidate remaining stock, Swiss agents were obliged to take delivery of a small number of the vehicles to qualify for their quota of more popular Alfa Romeo models.  <p>A number of enlargements of original Alfa Romeo Montreal advertisements are now available as A3 black-and-white or colour <a href="#Poster">posters</a>. <p>A <a href="Montreal/2modelsc.jpg">Montreal in custom rainbow livery</a> was acquired by a large Canadian company, Macdonald of Montreal, and featured with elegant Parisian models in a cigarette advertising programme. The Montreal image was also used to promote products ranging from <a href="Montreal/ShoeShop2.jpg">Italian shoes</a> (Calzaturificio Tradate, Via Roma, Turin, late 1967) to the <a href="Montreal/AlfasudAd2.jpg">Alfasud TI</a> ("De la Montr&eacute;al &agrave; l'Alfasud TI: Une tradition de race"). A Montreal was featured on the front cover of the <a href="Montreal/Blaupunkt87ad.jpg">Blaupunkt autoradio catalogue</a> for 1987.<p>In 1979 UK Virgin used a <a href="Montreal/Pistol2.jpg">"Swindle" Montreal</a> to promote the Sex Pistols record album <a href="http://www.reviewcentre.com/reviews42343.html">"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle"</a>. The Montreal appears on the <a href="Montreal/Pistol1.jpg">gatefold sleeve</a> of the double-LP album. (Note that two versions of this album were produced). It does not appear in the movie of the same name, although the movie review published by Mojo Magazine in June 2002 does include an illustration of a <a href="Montreal/Sue.jpg">prowling Sue Catwoman</a>. <p>More recently, the Montreal image has been used in <a href="Montreal/InsuranceAd.jpg">advertisements for classic car insurance</a>. In August 2003 a professional photographer shot <a href="mailto:lhamberger (at) t-online.de">Leopold Hamberger</a> with his Montreal for an <a href="Montreal/LeoSIP.jpg">advertisement for SIP Scootershop</a>, a major German supplier of spare and tuning parts for motor scooters from all decades.

These wheels can normally be recognised by a <a href="Montreal/Rims.GIF">reduced 14.5 mm diameter counterbore</a> on the outside of the hole for the valve, while the conventional wheels have a 24 mm diameter counterbore. However, during a transitional period some wheels were produced which do have the safety rim for tubeless tyres, but which still have the older 24 mm diameter counterbore. Tube-type tyres can be fitted on either type of wheel. It is not recommended to fit inner tubes in tubeless tyres having extensive internal ribbing. <p>The <a href="Montreal/Tyre.jpg">195/70-VR14 XWX</a> are still listed in Michelin's 2000 catalogue "<a href="Montreal/MichelinCat.jpg">Tyres for veteran, vintage and classic cars</a>" (French version "Les pneus pour v&eacute;hicules d'&eacute;poque" and German version "Reifen f&uuml;r Oldtimer und Liebhaberfahrzeuge" also available).  According to Michelin headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand, any Michelin agent can order them for you. However, in view of the small demand, production runs are only scheduled when distributor stock is believed to be exhausted. At present 195/70-VR14 XDX tyres, which are rated to only 230 km/h compared with 240 km/h for the XWX model, are more readily available but they can cost more since there is generally no demand for them.<p>With the Montreal's maximum speed of over 220 km/h, and many limit-free roads in the early 1970s, Alfa recommended that exclusively V-rated tyres should be fitted to the car. These tyres have a maximum speed ratimg of 240 km/h. In view of today's restrictions, many national authorities accept the use of H-rated tyres that have a maximum speed rating of 210 km/h. Some authorities do not specify a speed rating at all, but the driver could be held responsible in the event that inadequate tyres were a factor in an accident. In the US there is no regulation of the ratings of tyres fitted to private passenger vehicles and federal law does not even require that the load index and speed rating symbols be indicated on the tyres.<p>The types of modern tyres which Michelin can supply in this size and rating (but with a different tread pattern) vary from country to country. In some countries like Switzerland, the 91V-rated (615 kg, 240 km/h) <a href="Montreal/Pilot.jpg">Pilot HX MXV3-A</a> is available in 195/70-R14 size (about CHF 220). In some other countries only the 91H-rated <a href="Montreal/EnergyMXV4.jpg">Energy MXV4</a> model is available in 195/70-R14. <p><a href="http://www.vintagetyres.com/">Vintage Tyre Supplies</a> could supply Michelin 195/70-VR14 XWX tyres at GBP 113.50 and 195/70-VR14 XDX at GBP 185.  If the tyres are in stock when you order, they are shipped immediately.  If not, and they have to be obtained from Michelin, there is an additional delay but there is no increase in price even for an order for a single tyre. An informative vintage tyre guide is available on <a href="mailto:sales (at) vintagetyres.com">request</a>.<p><a href="http://www.coker.com/">Coker Tire</a> also offer Michelin 195/70-VR14 XWX in the USA at USD 222. Despite a rumour to the contrary, Michelin have claimed that they would never sell moulds for high performance tyres to a company outside the Michelin group and allow them to actually manufacture tyres carrying the Michelin name. <p>Michelin state that when stocked under correct conditions the shelf life of their tyres exceeds 10 years.  A visual inspection for ozone cracks should be carried out.<p>Current production Continental 195/70-R14 tyres have the <a href="Montreal/CV90.jpg">CV 90 tread pattern</a>.  The 91V-rated version (Article 03 52 276) is being phased out, which will leave only the 91H-rated tyre (Article 03 52 275).<p>In Switzerland, over 20 types of 195/70-HR14 tyres are readily available at prices ranging from CHF 56 (Nankang Econex NA-1) to CHF 125 (Yokohama Advan HF type-D A008).<p>195/70-VR14 tyres that have been supplied in Switzerland include:<ul><li> <a href="Montreal/VSprintClassic.jpg">Vredestein Sprint Classic</a><li> <a href="Montreal/MaxxisMAP1.jpg">Maxxis MA-P1</a>.

Snow chains are not permitted with the 205/70 VR14 size. The use of these non-original tyre sizes will result in speedometer errors of 1.1% and 2.2% respectively.<p><a href="mailto:robert.digirolami (at) bt.com">Robert Di Girolami</a> has fitted <a href="Montreal/YokoA509.jpg">Yokohama 225/60-R14 A-509</a> tyres on the standard Montreal Campagnolo wheels.<p>In countries in which the use of non-homologated wheels is permitted, changing from 14" to 15" wheels allows the use of 205/60 tyres that are much more readily available than 195/70 tyres for 14" wheels.<p>On-vehicle wheel balancing systems can detect a wide range of imbalance conditions caused by the drum and rotor, studs, nuts and bearings as well as the wheel and tyre. When balancing the Montreal rear wheels using an Equitron or similar balancer, Alfa Romeo recommended chocking the front wheels and accelerating to 110 - 120 km/h with the rear of the car on jack stands. With the <a href="Montreal/Equitron.jpg">sensing element of the balancer as near as possible to the wheel being balanced</a> there is very little interaction from the balance condition of the other wheel.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Wheels"><h4>Wheels</h4></a><p>The striking <a href="Montreal/ProtoWhl.jpg">show-car wheels</a> which equipped the Expo '67 concept cars  were not fitted to the series production Montreals, which were given 5.8 kg 6.5J x 14" magnesium-aluminium alloy (elektron) <a href="Montreal/MyWheel.jpg">Campagnolo wheels</a> of a tamer multi-spoked "turbina" design.

Unlike the version used on some Alfettas, which are secured by a large circlip, the central Alfa Romeo emblem of the wheels fitted to most Montreals is a press fit.  The press-fit emblem is easily removed by a sharp tap from inside the hub. A suitable <a href="Montreal/Etool.jpg">tool to replace it</a> can be fashioned from a hard plastic cup of dimensions and profile such that it presses only on the periphery of the emblem. Normally the emblems are a good fit, but a touch of silicone can be applied for extra security.<p>The thin hub flange for the emblem can be damaged by the mounting arrangements of some wheel balancing machines if their conical securing device is overtightened. Instead of mounting the wheel on an axle passing through the hub, it is preferable to insist that the operator mount a universal adapter plate on the balancing machine and secure the wheel by its four studs.<p>The decorative wreath pattern of the <a href="Montreal/WhEmblem1.jpg">press-fit emblem</a> has an external diameter of 46 mm, while on the <a href="Montreal/WhEmblem2.jpg">alternate version</a> the wreath diameter is reduced to 40 mm to provide a clear flat area for the circlip.

It is not an agile country lane sports car like some smaller Alfas, and it is generally recognised that the suspension and <a href="Montreal/RearSuspension.jpg">Giulia-style live rear axle</a> are the most debatable parts of the vehicle's design. With the original suspension there is significant sway when cornering sharply at high speed and the rear wheels tend to patter on rough road surfaces, although the limited-slip differential does maintain the drive quite well.  Many owners report much improved handling on replacing the original shock absorbers by Bilstein or Koni dampers. <a href="http://www.bilstein.com/">Bilstein</a> recommend B46-0463 gas pressure shock absorbers for the <a href="Montreal/FrtBilstein.jpg">front axles</a> and B46-0473 for the rear axles of the Montreal.<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M8UKS?ie=UTF8&tag=thealfrommonw-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007M8UKS">Buy Bilstein front shocks for the Alfa Romeo Montreal</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thealfrommonw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0007M8UKS" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M8UL2?ie=UTF8&tag=thealfrommonw-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007M8UL2">Buy Bilstein rear shocks for the Alfa Romeo Montreal</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thealfrommonw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0007M8UL2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /><p>General information on procedures for checking car trim and front end geometry which is largely applicable to the Montreal is given in "Giulia and 1750 Models - Wheel and Suspension - Front End Geometry", DIASS Publication 1507, published in May 1970. The specific data for the Montreal were not included but were subsequently published in "Giulia, 1750, 2000 and Montreal models - Wheel and Suspension - Front End Geometry - Amendment to Specifications (Supplement to DIASS Public. 1507)", DIASS Publication 1838, published January 1972 (revised edition October 1977). The data are also included in the Montreal "Characteristics, inspection specifications and overhaul directions", DIASS Publication 1785, published June 1971. The latter document is included in the Montreal Shop Manual, although in one of the Mercian Manuals reproductions the relevant pages (61 and 62) are missing.<p>The specified loads for suspension trim are 45 kg on each front seat and 25 kg on the floor wells plus a full tank of fuel.<ul><li> <a href="Montreal/SpringSag.jpg">Spring sag</a>: Front suspension, A - B = 24 &plusmn; 5 mm.

A kit of 4 springs and 2 anti-roll bars can be supplied by <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/index.htm">Classic Alfa</a> for GBP 395 plus tax where applicable. A set of 4 Koni Sport shock absorbers can be supplied for an additional GBP 260, or Bilsteins for GBP 356. The anti-roll bars are similar to those of the HBE kit described in the following, and the ride height is about 3 cm lower.<p>A fast road handling kit for the Montreal can be suppplied by <a href="http://www.alfaholics.com/">Alfaholics</a> for GBP 440. This includes 4 springs, a 30 mm diameter front anti-roll bar and ball-joint drop links, but the rear anti-roll bar is not changed.<p>Suspension specialists <a href="http://www.harveybailey.co.uk/">Harvey Bailey Engineering</a> manufactured a Montreal handling kit comprising modified front and rear anti-roll bars and four new springs (plus optional Bilstein dampers). HBE are now a member of the <a href="mailto:info (at) epmtechnology.com">EPM Technology Group</a> (20 Victoria Road, Draycott, Derbyshire DE72 3PS, UK, Tel: +44 1332 875451, Fax: +44 1332 875415). The replacement front anti-roll bar has a diameter of 29 mm compared with 24 mm for the original part, while the rear bar has a diameter of 12.8 mm compared with 16 mm for the original. The ride height remains the same at the front and is lowered by about 2 cm at the rear.  While HBE have not released any technical data for the kit, the principle appears to be to reduce roll on cornering and dive on braking by greatly stiffening the front end, while providing a soft rear axle to maintain the drive in critical conditions. This approach has been used successfully in the track preparation of other powerful 105-series Alfas. The HBE handling kit for the Montreal cost about GBP 550 but following the departure of Rhoddy Harvey-Bailey from the company future availability is uncertain.<p>The handling kit can be installed without the use of special tools.  However, as new drop link rods are not provided for the front anti-roll bar a tool equivalent to <a href="Montreal/A.3.0243.jpg">Alfa Romeo A.3.0243</a> is required to extract the old silentblocs from the original rods. A half-inch drive socket with an external diameter just less than 30 mm may be used as a pusher. Alternatively just drill out the rubber in the old silentblocs, after which their thin outer shells can be easily removed from the link rods. The utmost attention must be paid to safety procedures when decompressing the springs, which are under very high pressure.  Note that the HBE front springs are stiffer than the original ones and have an uncompressed length of 29 cm compared with 35 cm for the latter. Hence when decompressing the original springs a range of 6 cm greater than that required for the HBE ones must be accommodated.  If <a href="Montreal/Decompression.jpg">M10 threaded rods</a> are used to substitute the <a href="Montreal/A.2.0169.jpg">Alfa Romeo tool A.2.0169</a> then a full set of 4 must be employed and they should have a length of at least 24 cm each. Materials must be of unquestionable quality - if a tool part fails and the suspension explodes it could do so with force sufficient to throw the car off jack stands. <p>Unlike the HBE front springs, which are made from larger diameter rod than the originals, the rear springs in the HBE kit are similar to the original ones with one turn removed. With the car body on jack stands, support the rear axle by the differential at a height just above the strap limit and place a jack under the trailing arm. The special bolts which secure the trailing arms to the rear axle are slightly longer than the clearance from the brake shields.  To facilitate the extraction of the bolts, observe the protrusion before removing the nuts retaining the links to the rear anti-roll bar and <a href="Montreal/TarmBolt.jpg">trim the length of the bolts</a> by a few mm before driving them. When the trailing arm jack and the rear axle support are precisely aligned the bolts can be extracted easily. Alfa Romeo tool <a href="Montreal/A.2.0178.jpg">A.2.0178</a> or an equivalent <a href="Montreal/DriverTool.jpg">replica</a> can be used to protect the threads.<p>To avoid damage to the protective brackets below the trailing arm pivots, lower the arms just sufficiently to allow the rear springs and dampers to be removed and exchanged.  Transfer the slit rubber bushes, sleeves and clips to the new rear anti-roll bar before mounting it as new ones are not supplied with the handling kit.  <p>Spring sets for the Montreal can be supplied for USD 299 plus shipping by <a href="mailto:dlrugh (at) msn.com">Rugh Engineering</a> in Portland, Oregon, USA, Tel.

The <a href="Montreal/Exhaust.GIF"> exhaust system</a> comprises 6 main elements - a centre muffler, silencer and rear muffler in each of the two exhaust pipes from the separate manifolds for cylinders 1-4 and 5-8, interconnected throughout by 45 mm OD tubing. The centre mufflers are identical, whereas the silencers and <a href="Montreal/RearPipes.jpg">rear mufflers</a> have left and right-hand mounting brackets.

Such engines are distinguished by the letter 'S' in the Engine No. (e.g., I have AR00564*S0883*).  They were equipped with Marelli S 127 D distributors instead of the earlier type S 127 C. See the <a href="index.html#Distribution">Ignition distribution</a> section for the 1973 recommendations superseding the 1971 specifications.<p>The 105.55.04.030.00 Spica injector pumps were also replaced with a new model (105.64.04.030.00) having a different cam profile. The later pumps have a red or <a href="Montreal/PaintDot.jpg">yellow dot on the upper part</a> and are <a href="Montreal/SpicaA.jpg">stamped with the letter 'A' at the control unit end of the pump section</a>. (Contrary to some documents such as Technical Bulletin 04.73.2.1 the 'A' is not stamped on the cylinder head of the engine!). <p>CO content (checked at both exhaust pipes) when idling at 850 rpm with a warm engine is about 6.5% for non-'S' engines. An 'S' engine with red dot Spica may achieve 3% CO but Alfa Romeo indicated that if the engine does not run smoothly with these settings it is permissible to reduce the <a href="#Idling">idling airflow</a> as far as results in the CO content increasing to a maximum of 4.5%. An 'S' engine with yellow dot Spica should achieve 3% consistently.<p>Swiss regulations permitted 1500 ppm max HC and 10% min CO<font size=-3>2</font> for the Montreal. For comparison the typical limits for a modern vehicle equipped with a catalyser are 0.1% max CO, 100 ppm max HC and 13% min CO<font size=-3>2</font>. Since 1995 (Art. 59a OCR, L'Ordonnance sur les r&egrave;gles de la Circulation Routi&egrave;re), Montreals first matriculated in Switzerland prior to 1 January 1976 do not require to undergo an annual antipollution test.  <p>In the UK, cars manufactured prior to 1 February 1975, or that were first registered before 1 August 1975, do not require full emissions testing, just a visual exhaust check.<p>In the US, emission testing requirements for classic cars vary from state to state (exemption in California 30 years after first registration, 25 years in some other states, no age exemption in others unless the car is registered as an antique). In California the biennial test is run on a dynamometer to check emissions at idle, 15 miles per hour and 25 miles per hour. It is also required that no piece of factory-installed smog equipment has been removed.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Accel"><h4>Accelerator</h4></a><p>The Montreal accelerator pedal is linked by levers and a cable to a mechanism which rotates the control arm of the Spica injection pump and opens the eight throttle plates in unison. Modifications to the accelerator mechanism were introduced from Chassis No. 1427428 (although the changes were also made to some vehicles with lower Nos.). The <a href="Montreal/OldAccel.GIF">earlier design</a> had a single return spring on the relay crank while the <a href="Montreal/NewAccel.GIF">later version</a> has a pair of springs attached to a plate fitted to the supporting bracket of the starter motor.  In addition to these springs the relay crank itself, the cable and the return spring for the accelerator pedal linkage were also changed. <p>The position of the <a href="Montreal/AccelBrkt.GIF">securing bracket for the activated end of the accelerator cable</a> must be adjusted carefully so that the cable remains accurately aligned in the vertical plane for the full travel of the accelerator pedal.  The mounting holes for the bolts by which the bracket is attached to the bulkhead are slotted to permit this adjustment.  If the linkage moves smoothly, but the accelerator feels stiff when driving, the pedal may simply be too high for the angle of your shoe!  The pedal height can be reduced by replacing the M6x25mm stop screw on the above bracket by a longer one, which allows the cable adjuster to be set to move the operating range of the pedal nearer to the floor after reducing the height of the floor stop. Some drivers may find that it is more comfortable to replace the original accelerator pedal by a modified one from an Alfetta. <p>Unlike those of the brake and clutch pedals, the cover of the accelerator pedal is not replaceable separately. The complete pedal is the same as that fitted to some other models, such as the Giulia 1600 TI and Super, and new ones may be purchased for around USD 45. The 9-1973 revision of the parts catalogue indicates on p.92 that the Montreal has two accelerator pedals! Perhaps because it is such fun to push?<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Acceladj"><h4>Throttle adjustment</h4></a><p>The accelerator adjustments should be checked before making changes to the Spica injection settings. This <a href="Montreal/AccLinks.jpg">drawing</a> identifies the accelerator bell crank in yellow, the throttle control rod in red, the throttle tie rod in blue and the Spica link rod in green. With the accelerator cable, throttle control and tie rods and Spica link rod disconnected, the idle and full throttle limit screws should first be set, using <a href="Montreal/A.4.0126.jpg">special tool A.4.0126</a> if available. Tools can be supplied by <a href="http://www.tstrettberg.de/">TST Rettberg</a>. At idle, the relay crank should be horizontal (parallel to the plane of the upper surface of the intake throats). The <a href="Montreal/ThrottleSet.jpg">rotation angle of the crank</a> to the full throttle position should be 78 deg.<p>After removing the two central O-rings, the special tool is <a href="Montreal/ThrottleTool.jpg">mounted on the left throttle unit</a> (not on the right head, as shown in the workshop manual). There are two versions of the tool with slightly different drilling. To facilitate mounting the earlier version without removing the Spica BC, cut a slot from the forward hole to the front edge of the tool. Adjust the idle limit screw so that the ball of the relay crank just <a href="Montreal/IdleStop.jpg">touches the underside of the reference arm</a>. Tighten the locknut. Now pivot the arm out of the way to allow the crank to be rotated such that the ball <a href="Montreal/FullStop.jpg">touches the full throttle reference arm</a>. Set the full throttle limit screw, tighten the locknut and remove the tool.<p>With the throttle control rod reconnected, first set the butterfly idle position for <a href="Montreal/LHmanifold.jpg">left side</a> cylinders 7 and 8 by adjusting its length. The throttle butterflies should just close (but close <i>completely</i>) when the relay is on the idle stop and they should not impact the throats when the throttle is released. Note that the lengths of the throttle control and tie rods can be adjusted simply by rotating their hex centre sections, which have right hand threads at one end and left hand threads at the other. Tighten the locknuts and set the butterflies for cylinders 5 and 6 by the central adjusting screw.  Now connect the throttle tie rod and set the butterflies for <a href="Montreal/RHmanifold.jpg">right side</a> cylinders 1 and 2 by adjusting its length. Then tighten the locknuts and set the butterflies for cylinders 3 and 4 by the central adjusting screw. Check the synchronisation by comparing the grip on a 0.03 mm feeler gauge or a strip of paper inserted between each butterfly and throat in turn and readjust if necessary. Note that this grip test is to check the synchronisation, <b>not</b> to set a gap!<p>If a <a href="Montreal/VacGauge.jpg">four-column vacuum gauge</a> equivalent to Alfa Romeo <a href="Montreal/C.2.0014.jpg">C.2.0014</a> is available it can be used with a set of four <a href="Montreal/C.2.0012.jpg">C.2.0012</a> three-way adapters to <a href="Montreal/VacGaugeUse.jpg">fine tune the throttle synchronization</a>. A Syncrotest (C.2.0019) or similar manometer may be used to check the intakes one at a time.<p>After reconnecting the accelerator cable, set the cable adjuster and floor stop such that full throttle is obtained when the pedal is fully depressed, while there is a little slack at idle. See the Spica TA section for adjustment of the Spica link rod length.   <p><a href="Montreal/ABplot.jpg">This graph</a> indicates the relationship between throttle rotation angle and Spica input lever rotation angle tabulated in DIASS 1785 (6/1971).

A hand throttle is provided which acts on the accelerator linkage via a cable and allows the idle speed to be set to much higher values for operations such as mixture adjustment.  To avoid breakage of its fragile <a href="Montreal/ManThrottleLever.jpg">plastic operating lever</a>, the hand throttle should be used only to block the accelerator after the pedal has been depressed to the position required.<p>A broken hand throttle operating lever can be <a href="Montreal/ManAccel.jpg">repaired and strengthened</a>.  After securing the parts with cyanoacrylate, drill long 1.7 mm dia holes through them and insert cyanoacrylate-coated 1.6 mm dia hard steel reinforcement pins made from the shanks of HSS drills.  <a href="Montreal/ReproTlevers.jpg">Replacement operating levers</a> made of much stronger polyurethane bicomponent plastic can be supplied by <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a>.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="SpicaFI"><h4>Spica pump</h4></a><p>The Montreal's 8 cylinder Spica <a href="Montreal/MySpica.jpg">fuel injection pump</a> incorporates a <a href="Montreal/Spica.jpg">mechanical control unit</a> which meters the fuel delivery to the injectors in accordance with the engine speed and throttle opening angle. Compensation devices make corrections for atmospheric pressure, engine and ambient temperature, cold starting and initial running and fuel cutoff during deceleration.<p>The pump is driven at half the engine speed by a 0.5 inch wide Gates PowerGrip 270L050 <a href="Montreal/SpicaBelt.jpg">toothed belt</a> from a pulley on the left side intake valve camshaft. Replacement drive belts (Part No. 105.55.04.312.00, GR Code 60715327) are readily available from suppliers such as <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a>. When refitting the belt, the reference mark on the injection pump splined pulley should be in alignment  with that on the pump body when the "I" reference mark on the flywheel is centred in the clutch housing inspection hole, with the piston of cylinder 1 approaching TDC of the induction stroke. To achieve this, proceed as follows:<p>Remove the spark plug from cylinder 1 so that you can check the positions of the piston and the intake and exhaust valves in that cylinder. Rotate the engine slowly (for example, by pushing the car forwards or backwards with 4th gear engaged) until the piston is at TDC and check the positions of the valves. If a valve is open its rim is visible, whereas if it is closed it is not visible. If both valves are open, the crankshaft is at TDC of the induction stroke, which is correct. If both valves are closed, the crankshaft is at TDC of the power stroke, which is incorrect. (The 1P mark on the flywheel will appear in the clutch housing inspection hole in both cases). If the crankshaft is at the incorrect TDC, rotate the engine 360 deg to the correct TDC. Now rotate the engine backwards (for example, by pushing the car backwards with 4th gear engaged) by 70 deg until the "I" reference  mark on the flywheel is centred in the clutch housing inspection window. (At this position the piston is approaching TDC of the induction stroke and the exhaust valve is open and the intake valve is still closed, whereas approaching TDC of the power stroke both valves are closed). With the crankshaft in the correct position, <a href="Montreal/SpicaMark.jpg">align</a> the reference mark on the injection pump splined pulley with that on the pump body. Put the belt on the drive pulley on the left side intake valve camshaft and then fit it on the injection pump pulley, if necessary rotating the pulley slightly so that the belt engages the nearest spline.  A tolerance of &plusmn; 5 mm is acceptable. Talcum powder can be applied to aid fitting the belt. It is worth checking the injection timing if there is any doubt about whether a mechanic has previously set it correctly. (If the injection timing is inadvertently set 360 deg out, the engine will still run but with reduced performance).<p>All the Montreal injection pumps carry the same Spica Type No. AIBB.8C.S75.T250/1. (8C = 8 cylinder). The three versions (differing only in the 3D cam profile) which were fitted to Montreals are identified by no colour dot, a red colour dot or a <a href="Montreal/PaintDot.jpg">yellow colour dot</a> on the pump body. (See the following section for the different set up data for each version).<p>Here are some photos of a pump which has been expertly restored by Bernhard Schalbetter.<ul><li> <a href="Montreal/SpicaRight.jpg">Right side of Spica pump</a><li> <a href="Montreal/SpicaLeft.jpg">Left side of Spica pump</a><li> <a href="Montreal/SpicaUside.jpg">Underside of Spica pump</a><li> <a href="Montreal/DisplaySpica.jpg">Display pump showing the control rack and pistons</a></ul>Regular engine oil and Spica filter changes are recommended to prolong the life of the pump components. Oil dilution caused by fuel leakage from the pumping elements into the engine oil increases wear and shortens the life of the engine piston rings. Do not inadvertently slacken the <a href="Montreal/SpringScrew.jpg">control rack tie rod spring retaining screw identified by the red arrow</a> on an installed pump! This may drop the spring, rendering the pump inoperable until it is opened for reinstallation. Breakage of this spring is not an uncommon cause of Spica pump failure.<p>Montreal Spica pumps were initially calibrated with the <a href="Montreal/Injector.jpg">fuel injectors</a> of the engines to which they were fitted. Alfa Romeo <a href="Montreal/TB04.73.3.2.jpg">recommended</a> that the pumps and injectors should be kept as a set and that when a new or reconditioned pump is fitted the injectors should also be renewed using those supplied with the replacement pump. The cylinder numbers of the new injectors should also be respected when they are installed. <p>The fuel pressure at the input to the Spica pump is nominally 1.5 kg/cm2 (21.3 psi), max 1.85 kg/cm2 (26.3 psi). As the pump is cooled by the circulation of excess fuel, it is not advisable to run with a very low fuel tank in hot weather. To prevent corrosion in the pump while a Montreal is in storage, Alfa Romeo recommended running the engine for a few minutes with some engine oil added to the fuel before shutting it down for a prolonged period. In very cold climates condensate in the control unit may freeze, blocking the mechanism. If this happens the shaft, rather than the drive belt, may break when an attempt is made to start the engine.<p>A small series of reproduction Spica driveshaft sealing rings (105.55.05.128.00) is being produced for <a href="mailto:dave.bramwell (at) huskyenergy.com">Dave Bramwell</a> by <a href="http://westernpolymers.com/">Western Polymers</a> in Calgary, Canada. These sealing rings are also used for the distributor driveshaft and the blanking plate on the opposite cylinder head. They will cost about CAD 16.15 each plus shipping.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Spica"><h4>Spica TA</h4></a><p>The <a href="Montreal/MontiTA.jpg">thermostatic actuator</a> (TA) of the Montreal Spica fuel injector has a <a href="Montreal/TA.jpg">right angle elbow</a> at the plunger end to clear the air filter box and differs from that fitted to 4 cylinder engines. The TA was not illustrated in the 1971 parts catalogue but this was corrected in the September 1973 revision. The TA ensures that the pump delivers the correct mixture at all engine temperatures, which is particularly important if the car is used for frequent short journeys, and also opens the throttles a little to ensure a satisfactory idle when it is cold.<p>With the TA removed, use a non-metallic gauge to check the free travel of the mechanism on which the plunger presses inside the Spica logic unit. It should be possible to depress the adjustment screw on the mechanism at least 31 mm below the mounting surface of the TA, encountering mild resistance from the spring, and it should return freely to its original position when the gauge is removed.  Be sure not to rotate the gauge when carrying out this test in order not to disturb the adjustment! The pump must be serviced if there is any sign of sticking.<p>The correct <a href="Montreal/DummyTA.jpg">dummy TAs</a> for setting up the different Spica models fitted to Montreal engines are A.4.0158 (27 mm, corresponding to 60 deg C) for pumps with either a red dot or no dot, and <a href="Montreal/A.4.0119.jpg">A.4.0119</a> (28.7 mm, corresponding to 76 deg C) for pumps with a <a href="Montreal/PaintDot.jpg">yellow dot</a>. With the Spica link rod disconnected and the appropriate dummy TA in place, adjust the internal cam centring screw on which the TA plunger presses by passing a screwdriver down the 4 mm diam hole in the TA shaft. The cam centring screw, which has a pitch of 0.7 mm, should be set for a <a href="Montreal/Agap.GIF">control arm/reference screw clearance "A"</a> of 0.5 mm for all versions of the pump.<p>Now replace the dummy TA by a 29 mm one, such as A.4.0120, which will result in the reference gap being reduced. Reconnect the Spica link rod and adjust its length so that it rotates the control arm sufficiently to increase the reference gap to 0.5 mm (tolerance 0.3-0.6 mm) for pumps without a coloured dot and 1.2 mm (tolerance 1.05-1.35 mm) for pumps with either the red or yellow dot. Since the cam centring screw is not accessed during this step, a hollow dummy TA is not required and a <a href="Montreal/Fixed29TA.jpg">simple solid 29 mm TA</a> can be used. Alternatively this adjustment can be made with a warm engine (80 deg C) and the real TA in place, but it should be noted that at idle the temperature can rise to 90-95 deg C before the radiator thermostat switches on the electric fan. It is not necessary to force the clevis socket of the link rod completely on the control arm ball for each trial. Just press the socket firmly on the outside of the ball while checking the reference gap with a feeler gauge.<p>Note that the 19 mm A.4.0159 dummy TA (corresponding to -20 deg C) is intended for adjusting the Spica CSS with the pump on the bench and it is not suitable for normal setting up.<p>When the dummy TA is replaced by the real one, the reference gap with a cold engine will be much greater. The Spica control arm will rotate sufficiently to raise the accelerator relay crank from the idle stop, opening the throttle butterflies slightly to ensure a satisfactory idle speed. The crank returns to the idle stop at engine temperatures above about 55 deg C. <p>A set of <a href="Montreal/SimpleDTA.jpg">simple dummy TAs</a> can be made by fitting M6 x 80 mm carriage bolts with a 20 mm dia washer, filed to 17 mm across the flats. Such TAs can be readily inserted and removed when adjusting the cam centring screw, and <a href="Montreal/TAinUse.jpg">secured in place</a> when adjusting the Spica link rod length.<p>The moulded clevis sockets of the <a href="Montreal/LinkRod.jpg">Spica link rod</a> often split after they have been removed from the ball joints many times for tuning adjustments. A visible gap between the clevis socket and its locknut would typically indicate that a split has allowed the socket to move. The sockets can be readily stabilised by a pair of miniature 8 mm dia hose clips, oriented as shown to avoid any possibility of interference with the mechanism.  Metal <a href="Montreal/MerxClevis.jpg">Mercedes clevis sockets</a> can also be used. Alfa Romeo specify that in order to make a fine length adjustment a misalignment of up to &plusmn; 30 &#176; from the in-line position of the sockets is permissible.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="TAOffsets"><h4>TA offsets</h4></a><p>Before tuning the Montreal fuel injection system, the TA calibration should be checked by measuring the extension of the plunger against a load of 4 kg with the bulb immersed in a water bath of controlled temperature. The <a href="Montreal/TAextension.jpg">total extension measured from the mounting flange</a> should be 23 +0.5 -1.0 mm at 20 deg C and 31 &plusmn; 1.0 mm at 100 deg C. Be sure to actually measure the temperature of the water bath, since boiling occurs at significantly less than 100 deg C at altitude or low atmospheric pressure.<p>In the course of time the TA may drift out of spec because of hydraulic fluid leakage. This is exacerbated by any <a href="Montreal/TAcorrosion.jpg">corrosion of the plunger</a> in the vicinity of the sealing O-ring. <a href="mailto:japeng (at) mweb.co.za">Hannes Paling</a> has <a href="Montreal/TAcorrosion2.jpg">dissected a TA actuator</a> to study this problem. It appears that the corrosion develops in the region just below the O-ring, outside the cavity filled with fluid. With the retraction of the plunger at low temperatures, this corroded region could be drawn into the O-ring, allowing fluid to leak out over time.<p>If the slope of the TA characteristic is correct (i.e., the range of plunger extension from 20 to 100 deg C is the full 8 mm), the Spica TA can still be used even if the plunger extension has a small offset from spec. The cam centring screw in the Montreal pump is a standard 0.7 mm pitch cyl-head M4 one, 12 mm long, with a compression spring on the shank to prevent the setting being disturbed by vibration. Because of the spring, the available adjustment range is about 6 mm, or 8.5 full turns. The Spica designer arranged that when adjusted for a nominal TA the screw is nicely positioned with about 5 mm of thread engaged.<p>To accommodate a TA with a positive offset (excessive plunger extension), a shim can be mounted under the actuator flange to bring it within specification and the cam centring screw adjusted in the normal way. If a shorter screw is used instead, some turns should be clipped from the compression spring to allow the screw to be inserted further.<p>For a TA that has a negative offset, a longer cam centring screw can be fitted if the 12 mm one would have too few threads engaged. If this is done, the spring should be opened up a little to ensure that it is still under compression. An alternative solution is to correct the TA itself by gently crushing the bulb, or inserting a tuning screw into it, until the plunger projection meets spec. Since the <a href="Montreal/TAparts.jpg">TA plunger</a> has a diameter of about 4 mm it could conceivably be fitted with a short extension but I have never heard of this being done.<p>If only a <a href="Montreal/DummyTA.jpg">fixed length dummy TA</a> is available for set-up, it can be used to set the pump gap and then the cam centring screw readjusted (at 0.7 mm per turn) to compensate for the offset of the real TA before it is installed. If an <a href="Montreal/C.6.0149.jpg">adjustable dummy TA</a> is available (which is preferable) it can be set to take account of the offset before being used for set-up. An adjustable dummy TA should be used to take account of the offset when adjusting the length of the Spica link rod.<p>One result of a negative offset is that the lower limit of the range of temperature which can be accommodated will be raised. With a 2 mm offset the plunger will disappear inside the cylinder at about -10 deg C, as against -30 deg C for a nominal TA or -20 deg C for one at the specified tolerance limit. Not an issue for Florida residents but certainly a consideration for Montreal owners who may use their cars at Alpine winter resorts.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="TArepl"><h4>TA replacement</h4></a><p>Defective Montreal TAs can be rebuilt by <a href="mailto:4hoeven (at) cox.net">Robin Hoeven</a> of San Pedro, California, by <a href="http://www.afra.it/">AFRA</a> in Settimo Milanese, Italy, by <a href="http://www.alfamontreal.ch/">B&uuml;rgi Automobile</a> in 8547 Gachnang, Switzerland, and by <a href="http://www.wesingram.com/">Wes Ingram</a> of Seattle, Washington. Since 1987, Robin Hoeven has rebuilt over 4000 Spica TAs, including several hundred Montreal ones. He fits the rebuilt TA with a <a href="Montreal/RHoevenRebuildTA.jpg">new stainless steel capillary tube</a>, so that even a TA with a broken tube is an acceptable core. The plunger is replaced with a heat-treated stainless steel one, ground and polished to hydraulic surface finish specs, and a stainless steel spring and buna-n O-ring are fitted. The cost is USD 325 plus shipping, and the rebuilt TA is guaranteed for 2 years. Robin can accept a core TA from a 4-cyl car and rebuild it to a Montreal one for USD 350. If no core at all can be supplied, there is an extra charge of USD 25.<p>A <a href="http://www.geocities.com/motorcity/downs/3837/ta_diy.html">DIY repair procedure for Spica TAs</a> has been described by Rich Hirsch. <a href="mailto:richardpamboer (at) planet.nl">Richard Pamboer</a> has <a href="Montreal/RPTA.html">described</a> a similar procedure in which a <a href="Montreal/TAcc.pdf">special compression chamber</a> is used to inject the fluid into the system.

The design uses a viton O-ring seal, which has a much higher temperature range and higher shore hardness than a neoprene one. <a href="Montreal/TAfilling.jpg">Filling</a> is accomplished by sucking with the lungs and the plunger end is fitted while submerged in the fluid. The bulb end is also kept submerged while the valve is fitted and closed. The first prototype TA has now undergone a successful <a href="Montreal/HannesTA2.jpg">long-term test</a>.<p>Hannes has provided an <a href="Montreal/MontrealTA.dwg">AutoCAD file</a> and  <a href="Montreal/HPTAparts.jpg">parts</a> and <a href="Montreal/HPTAassembly.jpg">assembly</a> drawings for the latest version of this replacement TA. There is a <a href="Montreal/TAflange.dwg">separate AutoCAD file</a> for the oval <a href="Montreal/TAflanges.jpg">mounting flange</a>, of which two are required per TA. It is cut from 3mm brass plate. Dimensioned drawings for the <a href="Montreal/HPTAsensor.jpg">sensor part</a> and the <a href="Montreal/HPTAflange.jpg">mounting flange</a> are also available for machining these parts manually. The capillary tubing must be silver soldered in place, as soft soldering is not sufficiently strong. At a later date Hannes plans to produce a batch of TAs.<p>An <a href="Montreal/AlfaCat1.jpg">electromechanical replacement</a> for the Spica TA was developed by <a href="Montreal/Alfacat.html">Alfacat Products</a>.  The unit featured a microcontroller-based control unit and could be equipped with an <a href="Montreal/AlfaCat4.jpg">optional beeper</a>. The <a href="Montreal/AlfaCat3.jpg">actuating plunger</a> was driven from the controller via a <a href="Montreal/AlfaCat2.jpg">flexible drive</a> in increments of 1.2 mm. The Montreal version (Model 1102-01A Opt03/Montreal) was produced in 1996 and current availability is unknown.<p>The Shankle "Sure-start" manual mixture enrichment device cannot be fitted to the Montreal Spica pump as it would obstruct the air filter box. <a href="mailto:nashbap (at) yahoo.com">Nash Bapola</a> has fabricated a <a href="Montreal/ManualTA.jpg">manual TA replacement</a> using brass DIY plumbing components and a bicycle gear shift cable. The plunger is a bolt with the head cut off and a piece of the cable inner sheath is inserted in the elbow to obtain smooth action over the 90 deg bend. The <a href="Montreal/ManualTAlever.jpg">operating lever</a>, a Shimano bicycle gear shifter, is mounted in the bracket formerly used for the hand throttle. It is pulled to retract the plunger during the engine warmup phase and in the released position the plunger extension is the same as that of a normal TA at operating temperature. The spring would return it to this position in the event of cable breakage. The total cost of this manual TA is under USD 20.<p>While popular folklore is that the Spica TA was originally filled with highly refined olive oil, and SAE 15 hydraulic oil and brake fluid have been used successfully for some rebuilds, the late Fred Di Matteo stated that the original fluid was undiluted glycol antifreeze. However, it may have been a polyethylene glycol of higher molecular weight than ethylene glycol, such as PEG-300 or PEG-400. In order to exclude air when refilling, he recommended assembling the TA submerged in glycol.<p>  <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="SpicaRef"><h4>Spica reference</h4></a><p>The <a href="Montreal/RefScrew.jpg">Spica reference screw</a> is set when the Spica pump is calibrated at the factory and should not be tampered with. Typically there are about 4 threads exposed on the control arm side of its mounting lug but the exact setting varies somewhat from one pump to another.<p>If it is known that the reference screw has been misadjusted, it can be reset by the following test bench procedure. Install a 27 mm dummy TA for a red dot or no dot pump, or a 28.7 mm dummy TA for a yellow dot one. Position a dial indicator to measure the relative height of the 3D cam follower through the barometric capsule opening of the pump. Start the fuel supply and while driving the pump at 2300 rpm adjust the cam centering screw through the hole in the dummy TA shaft for the lowest dial indicator reading, thus centering the cam follower in the calibration groove. Now adjust the reference screw to obtain a control arm/reference screw clearance of 0.5 mm.<p>A less precise setting may be possible by adjusting the cam centering screw for the lowest dial indicator reading with the pump mounted on the engine (stationary), the dummy TA installed and the Spica link rod disconnected.<p>  <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="CSS"><h4>Spica CSS</h4></a><p>To avoid any possibility that the connection wire to the Spica cold start solenoid (CSS) snags the throttle linkages, Alfa Romeo recommended in 1972 that the straight Faston connector fitted to early Montreals be <a href="Montreal/CSS.GIF">replaced by a right-angle one</a>.<p>With the injection pump removed from the engine, the CSS can be adjusted by removing the side inspection plate, fitting an A.4.0159 19 mm dummy TA (simulating -20 deg C) and adjusting the solenoid height to set a 1.5 mm <a href="Montreal/CSSgap.jpg">clearance "A"</a> between the pin (6) on the lever actuated by the solenoid and the shaped arm (7). An alternative procedure is to adjust the CSS for a drop in engine idling speed of about 100 rpm when the solenoid is energised by a jumper wire. This adjustment should be made with the engine warmed up and after the mixture has been set by the FCS. To avoid overheating of the solenoid do not energise it for periods of more than a few seconds at a time.<p>An oil damper on the CSS extension shaft slows its return to the rest position for the time necessary to keep the engine running immediately after starting. The piston of the damper is made of synthetic material and has a nominal diameter of 13.5 mm. If it tends to stick, the CSS will remain in the enriched position after deactivation, resulting in an over-rich mixture while the engine is warming up. This can be cured by removing the piston and turning down its diameter very slightly. The piston can be removed through the bottom of the dashpot after extracting the pivot pin linking the solenoid armature to its actuating rod. The pivot pin is secured by a small split pin which can be accessed through the rear inspection panel of the pump. The dashpot plug takes a 22 mm socket.<p>While the CSS performs correctly when energised by the application of power to the starter relay, it can be useful to add a CSS disable switch which can be opened to prevent flooding in the event of extended cranking, as when diagnosing an ignition problem.  To install the switch it can be tapped into the black lead from the ignition switch on the engine side of its connector. A new wire can then be run from the switch to the CSS, passing it through the bulkhead via the grommet for the rev counter cable. The wire should be insulated from the engine heat with glass cloth tubing and disposed such that there is no possibility of it interfering with the movement of the throttle linkages.<p>The switch and wire must both be adequately rated for the current of 10 A which is drawn by the CSS when it is energised.  The contact life of the <a href="Montreal/IgnitionSw.jpg">ignition switch</a> may be prolonged by energising the CSS via a relay.  <p>A 24 mm crowfoot spanner with a maximum thickness of about 6 mm is required for the CSS locknut. Alfa Romeo <a href="Montreal/A.5.0202.jpg">special tool A.5.0202</a>, intended for checking Alfetta track rods, is suitable. <a href="mailto:bergeb (at) online.no">Berge Bergesen</a> has fabricated a <a href="Montreal/CSSwrench.jpg">CSS locknut wrench</a> from an old spark plug spanner. <p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="FCS"><h4>Spica FCS</h4></a><p>In addition to cutting off the fuel supply during deceleration (see the following section), the position of the threaded housing of the <a href="Montreal/FCS.jpg">fuel cutoff solenoid</a> (FCS) controls the running mixture by setting the fuel flow for a given engine speed and control arm position. Unlike those on 4 cylinder engines, the FCS on Montreal Spica injectors is mounted with its axis horizontal instead of vertical. The <a href="Montreal/A.5.0174.jpg">A.5.0174 wrench</a> for the FCS castellated locking ring is difficult to manipulate without removing the air filter box but a simple <a href="Montreal/FCStool.jpg">FCS ring nut tool</a> can be fabricated from a 40 mm length of tubing of internal diameter about 29 mm (28.5 mm minimum).  This tool allows the locking ring to be freed for tuning the mixture without any dismantling. <a href="mailto:mygoose (at) mindspring.com">Tom Sanor</a> has provided a <a href="Montreal/TomSanor2.html">report</a> of how he successfully adapted an FCS ring wrench supplied by AR Ricambi so that it can be used on the Montreal without removing the air filter box.<p>The FCS locking ring can be damaged by the use of incorrect tools. <a href="mailto:HDN-AlfaMontreal (at) T-Online.de">Hannelore and Dirk Nehme</a> can supply <a href="Montreal/ReproFCSnut.jpg">reproduction locking rings</a> for EUR 13 each plus postage from Germany.<p>When tested on the bench, the FCS plunger should move from 0.3 mm below the surface to about 5 mm above it when the solenoid is energised. To check if the FCS is working, jumper battery voltage to it while the engine is running. There should be an audible click as the plunger moves and the motor should die immediately. For making tests like this, it can be convenient to have a fuse-protected outlet in the engine compartment, as suggested in the "Power outlet" section. When the FCS is activated the mechanism should move with only slight spring resistance, and retract when the solenoid is de-energised. If corrosion prevents it from retracting the mixture will be very weak, so that the engine may idle but not accelerate.<p>Having set the hand throttle for a fast idle (around 2500 rpm), the FCS may initially be set slightly on the lean side (screwed further in) of the position which results in highest engine speed.  Then check that the engine revs up smoothly from normal idle speed and, if necessary, enrich the mixture very slightly by unscrewing the FCS a fraction of a turn until this is achieved. The 8 notches inscribed at 45 deg intervals on the outside of the knurled section of the solenoid can help when assessing the small rotation. The mixture setting may be fine tuned by spark plug condition. In case you are confronted with an FCS which is totally out of adjustment I suggest starting with a setting of 14 threads exposed beyond the locking ring, or a distance from the outer surface of the locking ring to the end of the threaded cylinder of about 26 mm.  <p>The Montreal FCS is the same as that fitted to 4-cylinder Spicas, and tested used solenoids can be supplied by <a href="mailto:Ldandtb (at) pacbell.net">Alfa Parts Exchange</a> for USD 50 each.  An alternative part that can be used as a substitute for the FCS is the <a href="Montreal/CamSolenoid.jpg">cam retard solenoid</a> that was fitted to some 4-cyl Alfas with fuel injection, such as the 1988-92 75 twin spark.

The Spica cam itself suppresses fuel injection when the throttle is closed at high engine speeds but the cut-off is sharper when the FCS is functioning correctly too. The FCS is energised by a <a href="Montreal/SpicaMicroSw.jpg">control microswitch</a> mounted underneath the logic section which is operated by a <a href="Montreal/UswPlunger.jpg">plunger</a> actuated by the fuel delivery cam. It is deactivated when the speed of the decelerating engine falls to 1400 rpm, as against 1300 rpm for 4 cylinder engines. The solenoid draws a current of 800 mA when energised.<p>Defective operation is more likely to be due to failure of the <a href="Montreal/SpicaMS.jpg">microswitch</a> than failure of the solenoid itself. If the switch fails "closed", the FCS cuts off the fuel supply completely. (Just pull the faston connector off the solenoid if this happens on a trip). If it fails "open", which is more common, the fuel cut off on deceleration will be less sharp so there may be some burbling and afterfiring.<p>To check the microswitch, attach a test lamp to the connector of the FCS, rev up the engine and release the accelerator. The lamp should light immediately and extinguish again when the engine speed falls below 1400rpm.<p>New replacement microswitches  (Crouzet Type 831320C1.0) can be supplied by <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a>, either alone or <a href="Montreal/CabledSwitch.jpg">fitted with wires</a>, heat protection and faston connectors.

Tighten the lock nut before remounting the injector pump on the engine.<p>Failure of the microswitch can be caused by the ingress of water while washing the engine. Erratic operation can also be caused by rusting of the clip which secures the pivot of the operaing lever. To prevent this, some sealant can be applied to the cover gasket. Failure of the <a href="Montreal/ActuSeal.jpg">actuator oil seal</a> results in oil leakage from the bottom of the pump.

The bellows should be easily compressed between finger and thumb from about 27 mm to 25 mm and should immediately return to their normal length when released. As barometric pressure falls, the extension of the plunger should increase linearly at a <a href="Montreal/BarExtension.jpg">rate of about 1.5 mm per 100 mm of mercury</a>.<p>If the BC has to be replaced, note the distance between the flange and the base of the capsule before unscrewing it and screw the new one in to the same distance. With a warm engine, check the <a href="Montreal/BCadjust.jpg">position of the hairspring clip on the notched lever</a> after releasing the accelerator quickly from 4000 rpm to idle speed several times over. With the seasonal temperature compensator lever set to the "Above 15 deg C" position, 8 teeth (counting from the top of the notched lever) should be engaged at a barometric pressure of 741-760 mm Hg and temperature of 15-30 deg C. The smaller the number of teeth engaged, the greater the effective radius of the lever and hence the greater the fuel delivery for a given cam lift. The number of teeth engaged in this temperature range at different barometric pressures should be as follows:<p><table border=3 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=3 width="50%"  >			<th align=CENTER><font  color="red">Pressure</font></th>			<th align=CENTER><font  color="red">Teeth engaged</font></th><tr>			<td align=CENTER><font color="#000000">700 - 720 mm Hg</font></td>			<td align=CENTER>10</td></tr><tr>			<td align=CENTER><font color="#000000">721 - 740 mm Hg</font></td>			<td align=CENTER>9</td></tr><tr>			<td align=CENTER><font color="#009933">741 - 760 mm Hg</font></td>			<td align=CENTER><font color="#009933">8</font></td></tr><tr>			<td align=CENTER><font color="#000000">761 - 780 mm Hg</font></td>			<td align=CENTER>7</tD></table><p>When the atmospheric pressure is 760 mm Hg at sea level, it is  710 mm Hg at an altitude of about 570 metres. At the summit of the St Gotthard pass (2092 m) it has fallen to 589 mm Hg. The Spica BC can provide compensation for pressures of less than 500 mm Hg, and <a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> reported no problems when crossing the Loveland Pass in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado at an altitude of 11,990 ft (3655 m).<p>Before removing the hairspring clip from the control rack tie rod (e.g., to dismantle the governor), be sure to note in which of the three holes it is positioned and replace it in the same one when reassembling. The clip is usually located in the central hole of the three. <p>The capsule is partially evacuated and prevented from collapsing by an internal spring. If the spring fails, the hairspring clip will move to the top of the notched lever, resulting in an over-rich mixture. If the capsule leaks, the internal spring will cause it to expand, causing the clip to move to the bottom of the lever. This may cause the mixture to be too lean for the engine to run. To allow the car to be driven, the defective BC can be temporarily substituted by a bolt of length which results in 8 teeth being engaged on the lever. The length of the bolt should be about <a href="Montreal/BCL.jpg">L = 49 mm</a> measured from the mounting flange (about 37 mm from the bottom end of the casting).

This provides a margin of safety against possible piston damage in the cylinders fed by those Spica pumping elements whose delivery rate is on the low side of average. Because the TC lever has little effect on the mixture at low rpm, it can be used for fine tuning the high-speed mixture without significantly altering the idling. Moving the lever to the "Above 15 deg C" position will lean the mixture at high rpm by about 6% compared with the "0 - 15 deg C" position. Watch out for any signs of lean detonation if this is done. On a cold winter night <a href="mailto:peter.schweiss (at) ifp.fzk.de">Peter Schweiss</a> experienced piston burning after a 30-minute 220 km/h run at full throttle with the TC lever set to "Above 15 deg C". <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Injectors"><h4>Fuel injectors</h4></a><p>The Montreal <a href="Montreal/Injector.jpg">fuel injector nozzles</a> require no maintenance and were expected to have the life of the car itself. Both ends must be completely sealed if they are replated for cosmetic reasons. Testing the injectors is justified only if they have become corroded during a period of disuse or there is a definite indication of malfunction. A Diesel injector handpump with a pressure gauge reading up to 50 kg/cm2 can be used (with gasoline) to check for injector nozzle opening pressure, leakage and spray shape. The pipe from the test pump should be connected to the injector inlet fitting, which has a 12 x 1.5mm thread.<p>Having first operated the pump quickly to prime the pump and injector, it should then be operated slowly to determine the pressure at which the nozzle opens. This should occur at a pressure of 25-28 kg/cm2 for new injectors and a minimum of 18 kg/cm2 for used ones. To test for leakage, raise the pressure slowly to a value 1-2 kg/cm2 below that at which the nozzle has been found to open. There should be no drip from the nozzle during the following 5 seconds.<p>When operating the pump quickly there should be good vaporization even at minimum delivery and the spray cone should be straight and about 20 mm dia at a distance of 100 mm from the orifice. Injectors which fail to meet these requirements must be replaced. They should be lubetorqued to 2.8-3.2 mkg.<p>It is very unusual for an injector to become blocked. If fuel delivery from one injector stops, the cause may be breakage of the connecting rod in the corresponding pumping element.<p>Owing to the high operating pressure, any tiny invisible cracks in the fuel injection tubes can affect operation. To check for this, feel by hand for any cold spots along the tubes which could indicate that fuel is being vaporized. To avoid vibration-induced fractures it is important that the <a href="Montreal/InjectorLineClips.jpg">injector line clamps</a> be securely tightened.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Delivery"><h4>Spica fuel delivery</h4></a><p>If a test bench is available the calibration of the Spica pump can be checked. The injectors should be connected in the same order that they are fitted on the engine. About 200 gm of engine oil should be poured into the governor and the appropriate dummy TA inserted (see Spica TA section). It is assumed that the barometric pressure is in the range 741-760 mm Hg and the temperature compensation lever is at "N", so that 8 teeth of the notched lever are engaged (see Spica BC section).<p>If the pump delivery is found to be equally rich or lean over all the elements this should be corrected by adjustment of the FCS. If one or more individual pumping elements are out of spec, this should be corrected by turning the piston of that element slightly after slackening the securing screw of its pinion. Clockwise rotation of the piston reduces the delivery whereas anticlockwise rotation increases it. The pinion itself should be located such that there is one tooth free at each end when the rack is moved through its complete range.<p>The hollows on the left side of each cylinder should be aligned with the retaining set screw, which should not be long enough to press against the cylinder as this could distort it. On the other hand, <a href="mailto:nashbap (at) yahoo.com">Nash Bapasola</a> has reported encountering a retaining screw which was too short. This allowed the cylinder to rotate clockwise when the outlet valve tower was tightened, resulting in excessive fuel delivery from that pumping element.<p>To avoid the leakage of fuel into the oil past the lower copper sealing rings, ensure that the delivery valve towers are well tightened (but not overtightened) before being locked. The plastic rings on which they bear should be replaced if they have deteriorated. A simple way to determine whether fuel is leaking into the oil from the pumping elements or past the sealing rings is to apply compressed air and see where the bubbles appear.<p> The fuel deliveries

However, the actual <a href="Montreal/BoschSchema.jpg">circuit</a> of the electronic ignition units is more complex as, in addition to the firing thyristor,  3 transistors and numerous other components are employed in the charging oscillator and trigger circuits. A faint whistling sound should be heard in the CD units whenever the ignition is switched on, and the current drawn at their B terminals with the appropriate contact breaker wire disconnected should be in the range 1.2 to 1.6 A at about 11.5 v.<p>Although all the units carry the same Bosch Part No. 0 227 200 002, the internal printed circuit board layout can vary from <a href="Montreal/Boschpcb2.jpg">one unit</a> to <a href="Montreal/Boschpcb.jpg">another</a>. Bernhard Schalbetter has traced the circuit of several variants and provided a <a href="Montreal/BoschSch2.jpg">typical schematic diagram</a> indicating component values and suggested replacements for some of the semiconductors. Note that R1 and R3 are external to the PCB. In some units D6 is missing and R3 is 30 ohms, R4 is 600 ohms and R10 is 260 ohms instead of as shown. These ignition units were also fitted to the Maserati Ghibli, Indy and Mexico, as well as to certain Audi RO 80 models. Similar CD ignition units with a slightly different input circuit were fitted to certain Porsche 911 models equipped with an optical trigger instead of mechanical contact breakers.<p>The Bosch publication "<a href="Montreal/BoschTI.jpg">Technical Instruction: Battery Ignition Systems</a>" (English translation published by Dept. KH/VDT in October 1972) contains some quantitative information on the CD system including a performance comparison with conventional and inductive transistorized ignition systems. The variation of <a href="Montreal/VversusRate.GIF">secondary voltage</a> and power consumption with sparking rate is discussed, as well as the <a href="Montreal/VversusShunts.GIF">effect of shunts</a> formed by the deposit of lead compounds on the spark plug insulator nose.<p><a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> has provided a handy <a href="Montreal/IgnTshooting.pdf">troubleshooting chart</a> for Montreal ignition problems.<p>With one ignition unit not functioning, the engine will still idle smoothly, but there will be severe loss of power. As an emergency measure, the defective unit can be disconnected and the serviceable one <a href="Montreal/IgnJumpering.jpg">wired to supply both ignition circuits</a>, provided the engine speed is kept below 5000rpm. New replacement Bosch CD ignition units are rare and expensive, while Bosch in Germany no longer service them. <a href="mailto:hosvar (at) juno.com ">Horace Varner</a> reported in "The Montreal Register" in March 1990 having successfully repaired the Bosch CD unit by replacing the thyristor by a common 70 Amp 600 volt type SCR. Sometimes a defective unit can be revived by reflowing the internal solder joints. Other easily-repaired faults include arcing between components that are too close together on the pc board.<p>The CD ignition units can be repaired in Europe by <a href="http://www.ignitioncarparts.co.uk/">Ignition Car Parts</a> in the UK, by Mario Franceschini, Via Bologna 991, San Martino di Ferrara (FE), Italy, Tel (+39) 532 712451, by <a href="http://www.911-hkz.de">Ingenieurb&uuml;ro Gerberding</a> GmbH & Co.

They generate a primary voltage of 470 v, compared with 300-400 v for the Bosch CD units. For the Montreal, Joe LaPille of MSD recommended Series 6A ignition units such as Model 6200 (USD 273.30), or Model 6420 (USD 364.40) if rpm limiter is required. They may be used with their Model 8202 Blaster 2 coil (USD 52.70) with a socket tower or Model 8223 Blaster 3 coil (USD 58.10) with a spark plug style tower. These coils have a turns ratio of 1:100, so that the secondary voltage can reach 47 kV. Prices indicated are list and they are discounted by MSD dealers such as <a href="http://www.pawinc.com">Performance Automotive Warehouse</a>. Note that while multi-spark systems can be beneficial for lean mixture ignition, they also accelerate spark plug gap wear.<p><a href="mailto:mygoose (at) mindspring.com">Tom Sanor</a> has provided a <a href="Montreal/TomSanor.html">report</a> of very satisfactory results with the Model XR-3000 electronic ignition box and PS91 high-output E-core coil made by <a href="http://www.cranecams.com">Crane Cams</a>. A <a href="Montreal/CraneIgn.jpg">single system</a> is used, fired by an 8-cylinder optical trigger assembly which replaces the breaker points in the Montreal distributor. You can install the optical assembly in the distributor yourself. The XR-3000 (Part No. 3000-0231) is available from several retailers for less than USD 116 and the PS91 (Part No. 730-0091) for less than USD 53. <p><a href="mailto:info (at) mmanthey.de">Michael Manthey</a> has fitted his Montreal with the Lumenition Optronic ignition system manufactured by <a href="http://www.lumenition.com/">Autocar Electrical Equipment Co</a>. The Montreal is not included in their application list, but an adaptation of the system was made for Michael by their German agent Bob Stewart (Stewart Z&uuml;nd- und Abgastechnik, Ginsterweg 8, D-57271 Hilchenbach, Tel +49 2733 2329, Fax +49 2733 4491). The Montreal distributor had to be sent to Stewart for the fitting of the optical switches. Stewart now offers a version of the system which uses <a href="Montreal/ThorModules.jpg">Thor</a> instead of Lumenition modules. The cost is EUR 503.34, plus VAT where applicable and shipping (plus the return shipping of the modified distributor). To use this system the Montreal ignition coils have to be changed for conventional ones, such as Bosch 0221 119 030 or 0221 119 050 red coils without ballast resistors. These cost a further EUR 35 each. <p>The Montreal of <a href="mailto:harald.witt (at) okay.net">Harald Witt</a> is fitted with an unusual <a href="Montreal/SelfMadeIgnition.jpg">home-made ignition system</a>.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Coils"><h4>Ignition coils</h4></a><p>Montreals were equipped with a pair of Bosch 0 221 121 002 ignition coils. They have a primary winding resistance of 0.4 - 0.6 ohms and a secondary winding resistance of 650 - 790 ohms. These ignition coils are specifically designed to be driven by the relatively short-duration high-voltage pulses generated by the CD ignition units and coils designed for conventional contact breaker systems are not suitable. Because of the low primary winding resistance they cannot be tested with conventional testers such as the Bosch EFMZ1. The B coil is located forward of the A coil and the connections are numbered as follows: (1) Ground, (15) Input from CD unit, (4) High voltage output. <p>Alfa Romeo warned that to avoid damage to the <a href="Montreal/BoschIgn.jpg">electronic ignition units</a>, EMC suppression capacitors should not be added to any components of the ignition system. Never connect or disconnect any cables (including those to the spark plugs) while the ignition is switched on, do not crank the engine with either of the high voltage cables disconnected from its coil, and don't use the coil terminals as signal pickup points for ignition strobelamps.  Ensure that there are good ground connections at the ignition units and the coils.<p>The pulse inputs to the coils from the CD ignition units can be checked with an <a href="Montreal/IgnPulse.jpg">oscilloscope</a> with high impedance low-capacity probes. Since there are two coils, each fires twice for one revolution of the crankshaft. e.g., when idling at 850 rpm (14.17 Hz) the pulse repetition frequency is 28.33 Hz, corresponding to a period of 35.3 ms. The <a href="Montreal/IgnPulse2.jpg">pulses</a> should have an initial negative swing of 350-400v with a falltime of about 200 ns, followed by a positive overshoot of 200-250v. The duration of this cycle should be about 25 &#181;s and the subsequent damped oscillations should be of low amplitude. Revving the engine should result in no appreciable change to the pulse duration and only a small reduction in the pulse height.<p>Replacement 0 221 121 002 coils are no longer readily available. The earlier <a href="Montreal/BoschIgnCoil.jpg">0 221 121 001 type</a> which was made for certain Porsche 911 cars may be substituted, although they have slightly different dimensions and screw terminal input connectors instead of plug-in ones.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Distribution"><h4>Ignition distribution</h4></a><p>"Emission control" engines (with the letter 'S' in the Engine No.), which were initially fitted in late 1972 only to Montreals for export to certain countries, were installed in all the vehicles from early 1973. These engines were equipped with modified Spica injection pumps and with <a href="Montreal/DistPlate.jpg">Marelli S 127 D distributors</a> instead of the earlier type S 127 C, which had a buffer on the main shaft to limit the range of the centrifugal advance. The specifications for the S 127 D distributor are: Distributor points gap for each contact breaker 0.35 &plusmn;0.03 mm, contact pressure 950 &plusmn;100 g. Contact opening angle 56 &plusmn;3 deg, dwell angle 34 &plusmn;3 deg. Note that in the Italian and English owner manuals the distributor points gap tolerance is given incorrectly as &plusmn;0.3 mm. This was corrected in the French and German versions. Both distributors have a simple centrifugal <a href="Montreal/DistAdvMech.jpg">mechanical advance mechanism</a> and the published automatic advance characteristics (which appear to be rather approximate) for the <a href="Montreal/S127Cadvance.jpg">S 127 C</a> and <a href="Montreal/S127Dadvance.jpg">S 127 D</a> versions differ. Note that these characteristics are as measured at the distributor, at which rpm and angles are one half those at the flywheel. There is no vacuum advance.<p>After many years the grease in the mechanical advance mechanism <a href="Montreal/Dist2.jpg">tends to clog</a>. The mechanism should be <a href="Montreal/Dist3.jpg">cleaned thoroughly</a> and lightly lubricated from time to time to avoid sluggish operation, which could cause delayed reduction of the timing advance on deceleration. When dismantling the mechanism, note that the lighter of the two flyweights is marked with a yellow paint dot, together with its pivot pin and the end of the points cam fork with which it engages. The longer of the two springs should be put in the flyweight with this paint marking. The lubricant must be a high-temperature type and I use a non-melting grease with molybdenum disulphide. Wear of the distributor helical drive gears has been reported to cause a clattering noise with a resonance around an engine speed of 2500 rpm. The bearing is a 6003-2RS. <p>Because the points switch a much smaller current than in conventional ignition systems, contact life is very long. Breakage of any of the three springs on each <a href="Montreal/DistPoints.jpg">contact breaker set</a> in the distributor will cause the contacts to be shorted, so that the corresponding ignition unit will cease to function. For easy access when changing the points, a 120 mm <a href="Montreal/Dist1.jpg">gear puller</a> should be used to remove the upper bearing support frame. <p>Original distributor <a href="Montreal/DistRotor.jpg">rotor arms</a> (105.64.05.011.03/04, Magneti Marelli 71130801) are blue or black, whereas white rotor arms are reproductions. When replacing the rotor, the red dot should be aligned with the point punched in the distributor shaft. The <a href="Montreal/DistributorCap.jpg">distributor cap</a> should be kept clean and checked regularly for cracks or signs of arcing. Original <a href="Montreal/DistCap.jpg">replacement caps</a> are now rather rare but reproduction caps have also been made. Replacement helical gears and bearings can be supplied by <a href="http://www.alfamontreal.ch/">B&uuml;rgi Automobile</a>.<p>Since the 1971 owner manuals were never revised, the ignition timing description in them applies to the earlier (non-'S') engines. The fixed ignition advance of 5 &plusmn;1 deg (AF mark on flywheel in line with reference when contacts opening statically) for these engines was changed for the 'S' engines to a retard of 6 &plusmn;1 deg (RF mark in line with reference at 850 &plusmn;100 rpm). Since the flywheel is also scribed with a 1P TDC line, the AF or RF line may be coloured red to avoid confusion. Maximum timing advance remained 30 +0 -3 deg (AM mark in line with reference), measured at 4600 rpm for the earlier engines and at 4500 rpm for the 'S' version. The AM line may be coloured white. The ignition timing should be set using a strobelamp with the AM line rather than with the AF or RF lines.<p>To make the flywheel timing marks more easily visible, <a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> has <a href="Montreal/TMAssembly.pdf">scribed them on the crank pulley</a>, painting the pulley black and the marks yellow so that they show up well. Gene has provided a <a href="Montreal/TMPointer.pdf">detailed drawing for a pointer</a> which can be fabricated from sheet metal and attached to the three threaded holes already present on the engine front cover around the crankshaft oil seal. Since the pointer is adjustable, the timing marks do not need to be scribed precisely as long as the angles between them are measured accurately.<p><a href="mailto:nashbap (at) yahoo.com">Nash Bapasola</a> has reported that his 'S' engine Montreal gives best overall performance and no detonation with a maximum timing advance of 34 deg. He found that starting was easier and initial takeoff from a stop smoother with about 8 deg advance at 1000 rpm. <a href="mailto:info (at) mmanthey.de">Michael Manthey</a> reports that his 'S' engine will not start with a static ignition retard of 6 deg. <a href="mailto:mygoose (at) mindspring.com">Tom Sanor</a> reports that his optically-triggered Crane ignition system appears to switch quite abruptly from initial to maximum timing advance at a speed between idle and 2000 rpm and the engine runs very well with this characteristic.<p>Cylinder numbering from front to back is 1-2-3-4 right side, 5-6-7-8 left side. Montreal manuals indicate that the upper distributor arm (B circuit) feeds cylinders 2-3-5-8.  This can be misleading because the firing order for this circuit is 2-3-8-5.  The <a href="Montreal/DistLeads.jpg">order of the plug leads</a> clockwise from the front of the distributor should be 1-3-4-8-6-5-7-2, which gives the correct firing order 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8. This sequence is <a href="Montreal/FiringOrder.jpg">cast into both cam covers</a>, and is sometimes mistaken for the Engine No.!<p>For convenience in checking the dwell angles and 45 deg phasing of the A and B circuit distributor contacts on the test bench, I have prepared a <a href="Montreal/DistCard.jpg">calibration card</a> which can be printed (without changing the scaling!) on suitably stiff photo paper. After cutting out the card, it can be <a href="Montreal/Dist4.jpg">placed on the distributor</a> and used in conjunction with a screw through the rotor mounting hole as pointer. While the distributor shaft is rotated by means of the pointer, an audio continuity tester or lamp can be used to compare the opening and closing angles of the contact sets directly with the coloured sectors marked on the disc. The dwell angles should be adjusted by moving the contacts radially, while the relative phasing is adjusted by moving one or the other contact support plate a little axially around the shaft. <a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> has adapted a <a href="Montreal/DistProtractor.jpg">360 deg protractor</a> for this purpose. He attached a wire pointer to the distributor shaft, while the protractor itself is held in place by adhesive tape. I recommend making all measurements with the upper bearing in place, as without it there can be sufficient lateral play in the shaft to affect the results.<p>A dual-channel oscilloscope can be used to check the phasing of the A and B circuits dynamically. The <a href="Montreal/PhaseCheck.jpg">ignition pulses</a> on each circuit should occur midway between those on the other one. The linearity of the oscilloscope timebase should be checked with a square-wave calibrator before carrying out this test.<p>The <a href="Montreal/Hanger1.jpg">original design</a> of the hangers for the leads to cylinders 5-6-7-8 had a closed end.

These plugs have quad ground electrodes, which are claimed to increase ignition reliability and give a longer service life and a self-cleaning effect in the event of sooting. They are inexpensive, especially in <a href="Montreal/Lodge2HL10.jpg">boxes of ten</a>, and I would recommend fitting new ones every 10,000 km. Although the Lodge 2HL plugs are no longer manufactured, they are still readily available (eg, from <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> for GBP 6.50 each, or from <a href="http://www.difatta.com/">The Di Fatta Brothers</a> for USD 3.85 each). However, some quality issues have been reported with 2HL plugs of recent manufacture. Be careful not to overtighten the terminal nut. If the <a href="Montreal/Defective2HL.jpg">conductive seal breaks</a>, it is not impossible for the central electrode to fall down into the combustion chamber, causing serious damage. These quality problems have not been reported with earlier production Golden Lodge 2HL spark plugs in boxes marked "<a href="Montreal/Spica2HL.jpg">Spica. Made in Italy</a>".<p>The 2HL have a broad temperature window suitable for a wide range of driving conditions. Golden Lodge 2HLD spark plugs are believed to have the same characteristics except that they measure 16mm instead of 21mm across the flats. Possible alternatives are the <a href="Montreal/BP7ES.jpg">NGK BP7ES</a> (BP7EVX for the platinum version) and the Bosch Super-4 WR56, or the platinum W5DP with the electrode gap set to 0.7mm. If a worn engine is burning oil, it may be preferable to use the B7ES or B7EVX spark plugs, which have a shorter tip projection. The BP6ES plugs <a href="Montreal/NGKparts.jpg">suggested by NGK</a> are less subject to fouling in city traffic but may run too hot during hard driving, with some risk of piston damage.<p>This <a href="Montreal/LodgeCrossReference.pdf">cross-reference chart</a> lists equivalents of the Lodge 2HL from other spark plug manufacturers. Modern iridium spark plugs have a long life, but they can have narrower temperature windows and built-in RFI suppression resistors that slightly reduce the spark energy compared with non-resistorised plugs. All spark plugs deteriorate with use, and for the highest performance it is more important to replace them regularly than to purchase expensive ones.<p>Access to some of the spark plugs of the Montreal's V8 is more obstructed than for in-line engines. By welding an extension tube into the shaft of a standard universal-joint tool a handy <a href="Montreal/PlugTool.jpg">40 cm plug wrench</a> can be made which allows the obstructions to be bypassed. I recommend graphite emulsion for spark plug threads. Petroleum-based lubricants are unsuitable for this application as they can oxidise and bake hard.  <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="IgnitionSw"><h4>Ignition switch</h4></a><p>While replacement Montreal <a href="Montreal/IgnitionSw.jpg">anti-theft ignition switches</a> are available, they are expensive. Complete new Sipea 105.64.23.171.02 (GR Code 60716041) switches with a pair of <a href="Montreal/IgnKey.jpg">keys</a> can cost over CHF 200. The life of the ignition switch can be prolonged by fitting a relay. (See next section)<p>Ignition key blanks can be supplied by the <a href="http://www.casadellachiave.com">Casa della Chiave</a> in Italy, <a href="http://www.keyprof.com/en.index.php">Keyprof Luke</a> in Holland and <a href="http://www.keys4classics.com/html/ARMontreal.html">Keys4Classics</a> in Australia.<p>The wires supplying power to the ignition switch and column-mounted light switch are not protected by fuses. For safety, disconnect the car battery when working in the neighbourhood of these switches.<p>As in modern vehicles the ignition switch is secured by a shear-head bolt, but it may be found that the stub can be grasped and rotated with a suitable tool without having to be drilled out.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="IgnitionRly"><h4>Ignition relay</h4></a><p>The starter solenoid and CSS form a heavy inductive load, so that an arc is generated at the ignition switch contacts when they open. The arc can even cause the contacts to weld together, so that the starter remains engaged when the ignition key is released. To avoid this, and to prolong the ignition switch contact life, a relay can be installed to energise the CSS and starter solenoid indirectly.<p>Suitable low-cost 12v relays with 30A/40A SPST contacts are available from DIY motoring shops. Their faston connections have a standard layout and numbering (85, 86 for the coil; 30, 87 for the contacts). Note, however, that the orientation of the group of connections relative to the mounting lug does vary from one model to another.<p>The relay can be <a href="Montreal/IgnRly.jpg">concealed under the dash alongside the steering column and near the ignition switch</a>. It can be mounted by the existing M5 bolt that secures the bracket holding the padded panel of the manual accelerator lever.<p>In this position, only very short wires are required to connect the relay. The black wire from the ignition switch is cut and connected to terminal 86 on the relay, while terminal 85 is connected to chassis ground. A faston 'T' is used to tap terminal 30 of the relay into the red wire bringing battery power to the ignition switch. 2.5mm2 wire should be used for this connection. Finally the black wire leading to the starter solenoid and CSS is rewired to terminal 87 of the relay.<p>Be sure to disconnect the battery while doing any work on the ignition switch wiring!<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Switches"><h4>Other switches</h4></a><p>The Montreal central console <a href="Montreal/6SwBank.jpg">rocker switches</a> (105.64.65.039.00 etc.) were manufactured by <a href="http://www.ansor.it/">AnSor</a> of Canegrate - MI, Italy, and the contact configurations of the models used in the Montreal are shown in the <a href="Montreal/AnSorAlfaCatalogue.pdf">Alfa Romeo section of the AnSor catalogue</a>. (Search "Montreal"). They are sturdy but can develop intermittent contacts after many years of use. They can be quite readily dismantled for <a href="Montreal/Switches.html">cleaning and revision</a>. Some of these switches were also used in the 2000 Spider Veloce and in the 1750 Spider Veloce from Chassis No. 1820001 onwards (and also in the DeTomaso Pantera and other Italian cars, incidentally). Replacement switches can be supplied by <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> for GBP 20 each. <p>Replacements for the Jaeger <a href="Montreal/MultiSw2.jpg">steering column multi-function switch unit</a> (105.64.23.070.00) are available but quite expensive (about CHF 230). The switch housing is provided with apertures through which the contacts can be cleaned without dismantling. For a full service, dismount the switch from the column after removing the steering wheel and disconnecting the wires at the fusebox and <a href="Montreal/Flasher.jpg">turning indicator flasher</a>.  Drill out the four rivets securing the two parts of the switch housing and replace three of them with M3 screws and nuts on reassembly. (The 4th position will be occupied by a mounting screw). Broken switch mounting lugs can be repaired as described for the <a href="#Maccel">hand throttle lever</a> using 2 mm dia reinforcement pins.<p>The <a href="Montreal/RevSwitch.jpg">reversing lamp switch</a>, which is screwed into the rear of the gearbox extension housing, is not shown in the ZF Manual as it is an Alfa Romeo part. The switch was omitted from the first edition of the Montreal parts catalogue. It has Part No. 105.64.13.534.00 (GR code  60715912). The reversing lamp switch for Alfasuds (Part No. 510931) can be used to replace it at lower cost. The Montreal wiring diagram shows the switch energised through the upper Luci Citt&agrave; fuse, so that it is active only when the parking lights are on. In some Montreals it has been modified to be energised through the upper Accensione, Pompa Carburante fuse, which receives power at all times that the ignition switch is on. To make this wiring change, move the yellow/black wire from the left side of the third fuse from the top of the right fusebox to the top fuse on the same side of the box. <p>The brake fluid level warning light fitted to early Montreals incorporated an integral  push switch to allow the lamp bulb to be tested. In later Montreals this was superseded by an AnSor warning light without the test switch. While the Part No. change was made in the 9-1973 revision of the Parts catalogue, the illustration was not changed and TAV 109 does not carry the new date. The warning light can be tested by grounding the orange wire at the brake fluid reservoir.<p><a href="mailto:pi (at) crl.com">Paul Irvine</a> has described the repair of an Alfa Romeo <a href="Montreal/HazardSwRep.jpg">hazard warning switch</a> which appears similar to <a href="Montreal/HazardSw.jpg">the type (105.64.65.006.00/01) fitted in the Montreal</a>.<p>Montreal reversing lamp, radiator fan, fuel pressure and brake stop light <a href="Montreal/GPswitches.jpg">switches</a> can be supplied by <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a>.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Flasher"><h4>Hazard flasher</h4></a><p>The direction indicator lamps and hazard warning function are controlled by a <a href="Montreal/Flasher.jpg">Bosch type 0 336 401 004 flasher unit</a> (item 47 on the original wiring diagram) mounted under the dash. The hazard warning switch itself was omitted from the wiring diagram in the Montreal Owner Manual, but it is shown as item 75 in the A/C version of the wiring diagram in the following section. The output connection 49a from the flasher unit is connected to the column direction indicator  switch, which connects it to either the right or left side group of 3  bulbs when the indicator switch is operated. When the hazard switch  is operated, it connects 49a to all 6 bulbs simultaneously, in order to flash them all for the hazard warning. The switch is a simple 3-pole one. Separate poles are needed for each of the groups of 3 bulbs, so that  they are not connected together when the switch is open, while the third pole is for the internal red lamp, which is connected to ground  by the black wire.<p>This type of flasher unit was also fitted to the 1970 Toyota Corolla 1200 SL Sprinter and many VW cars exported to the USA from 1968 to 1974, but it is now difficult to source. It can be replaced by a more modern 4-pin electronic flasher unit such as the <a href="http://www.vehicle-wiring-products.eu/product.php/626/12-volt-4-pin-electronic-flasher-relay">Ring RFL5</a> if the unswitched side of the dashboard pilot lamp is connected to chassis ground instead of to contact 49.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Schema"><h4>Wiring diagram</h4></a><p>The Montreal wiring diagram which appears in some reproduction owner manuals can be difficult to read.

There is no fuse protection of the supply input to the bus side of the left fusebox, to the horn relay, the ignition switch and the stalk lighting switch. Be particularly vigilent to avoid an accidental short circuit of the main battery feed in the vicinity of the starter solenoid.<p>The PVC insulated copper wires installed in the Montreal are very durable unless subjected to overheating or corrosion. But the Faston connectors are not of the highest quality and some are without plastic sleeves and tags that crimp to the wire insulation. There is generally sufficient slack wire to replace them with better versions. Poor connections to the chassis are quite common if the paint has not been removed at the attachment point after a respray. Ensure that the engine ground strap is in place and undamaged. Compared with modern vehicles, the Montreal wiring is simple and fault finding is generally straightforward. Many checks can be done with just a test light, but a DMM is useful for measuring the resistance of wires and components, the voltage drops across connections, and any parasitic current drain from the battery.<p>Complete reproduction wiring looms for the Montreal are available from suppliers such <a href="https://www.autosparks.co.uk/">Autosparks</a> in the UK and <a href="https://www.okp.de/xtc2/105-Montreal:::3485.html">OKP</a> in Germany.

The idler shaft, which is chain-driven from the crankshaft, also carries the sprockets which drive the camshaft chains and the bearing may be somewhat under-dimensioned for this <a href="Montreal/Chains.jpg">complex asymmetric load</a>. Don't overtension the chains, and only adjust the tensioners when the engine is hot.<p>Several Montreal owners have reported failure of this bearing, even within the first 10 years of the car's life. In one case failure occurred after only 30,000 km, whereas many other Montreals have not encountered this problem in over 25 years of use. Driving technique may be a factor and after a cold start it is wise to allow the oil temperature to stabilise before fully exploiting the engine. With the Montreal's oil capacity of 11 kg this can require restrained driving for at least the first 10 km. It is advisable to keep the <a href="Montreal/DrainHole.jpg">drain hole</a> situated below the water pump housing clear by gently probing with a wire (max depth 43 mm), taking care not to damage the internal seal. As shown in <a href="Montreal/WPdrainHole.jpg">this picture</a>, the drain hole can be readily seen from above the engine using a mirror. In addition to providing a witness, the drain hole helps prevent any gradual seepage of coolant from reaching the bearing. Coolant is quite corrosive to the bearing. <p>Failure of the water pump bearing usually results in failure of the front seal, so that the oil and coolant mix and the first evidence of trouble may be the appearance of "mayonnaise" in the oil reservoir. Check for this symptom when considering buying a Montreal, as the bearing is inexpensive but replacing it is quite a major operation.<p>If the timing chest is removed, the water pump bearings can be extracted by a puller equivalent to <a href="Montreal/A.3.0259.jpg">Alfa Romeo tool A.3.0259</a>. <a href="mailto:japeng (at) mweb.co.za">Hannes Paling</a> has designed an <a href="Montreal/WBtool.jpg">impulse tool</a> which can (if you have a steady hand and a good eye) be tack-welded to the bearing to extract it. To extract the front bearing without removing the timing chest, <a href="mailto:v-herrera (at) raytheon.com">Val Herrera</a> fabricated an <a href="Montreal/VHtool.jpg">extraction tool</a> by grinding the heads and shanks of a pair of 4 in x 0.25 in bolts to replace the claws of a small standard gear puller. The ball bearing cage is first destroyed and removed to allow the balls to be moved around to insert the bolts. <a href="mailto:nashbap (at) yahoo.com">Nash Bapola</a> has reported successfully removing the bearing using a pilot bearing puller with a short extension on the jaws. He first destroyed the cage by breaking it in two pieces with a drift and removed the pieces with long nosed pliers. He then removed the balls with a telescoping magnet and pulled the inner race with pliers to give access to the outer race for the bearing puller.  The operation is best done with the engine standing on end, so that any debris and ball bearings which fall are collected in the cup of the front gear. <p>An <a href="Montreal/Fbearing.jpg">SKF 6003-2RS1 ball bearing</a> (CHF 14) is a suitable replacement for the cover bearing, which is 17x35x10 mm. This model is equipped on both sides with reinforced synthetic rubber contacting shields to prevent loss of lubricant and contamination by coolant. An <a href="Montreal/Rbearing.jpg">SKF NJ 202 ECP roller bearing</a> (CHF 60) may be used to replace the crankcase one, which is 15x35x11 mm. <a href="http://www.skf.se/index.html">SKF</a> bearings are available worldwide.

The preferred Gallital type has <a href="Montreal/PackingRing.jpg">three projecting stop tabs</a> that ensure that it is driven into the cover to the correct depth. When replacing the parts, ensure that the bearing surface of the packing ring is about 0.5 mm beyond the front end of the spacer, so that the spring presses the bearing surface firmly against the spacer with sealing ring. This normally requires a spacer length of about 29 mm. Avoid undue pressure on the packing ring as this can cause the spacer with sealing ring to adhere to it when the engine is not used for a long period.<p>In some cases corrosion of the steel spacer may contribute to bearing failure by causing damage to the <a href="Montreal/Seal.jpg">sealing ring</a>. <a href="mailto:albfur (at) hotmail.com">Alberto Furegon</a> can supply <a href="Montreal/AFspacer.jpg">replacement spacers</a> machined from 316 marine grade stainless steel for EUR 49.50, or a <a href="Montreal/AFkit.jpg">kit</a> comprising the spacer, the correct packing ring and a replacement O-ring for EUR 78 plus shipping.<p>Mal Nicholson of <a href="http://www.trentsideclassics.co.uk">Trentside Engineering</a> has produced a <a href="Montreal/WPKit.jpg">kit of service parts</a> comprising a sealed cover ball bearing, crankcase roller bearing, sealing and packing rings and corrosion-resistant spacers machined from stainless steel.

The <a href="http://www.burmanhiton.co.uk/the_company.htm">Burman</a> recirculating-ball steering box fitted to the Montreal is not interchangeable with those fitted to other 105 series cars. RHD cars were fitted with a Type 7320 <a href="Montreal/ZFstBox.jpg">ZF steering box</a> of the <a href="Montreal/ZF7320.jpg">worm-and-roller type</a> instead of the Burman model.<p>The Burman steering box should be filled with SAE 90 gear oil, not with grease, to a level about <a href="Montreal/StLevel.GIF">20 mm below the edge of the filler hole</a>. From 1974, to avoid damage to the lower oil seal by internal pressure build-up when the box is heated by the nearby exhaust manifold, the steering boxes were fitted with a filler plug having a breather slot.  Alfa Romeo recommended that earlier filler plugs be replaced by the later type, or that a <a href="Montreal/StPlug.GIF">breather slot be cut into them</a>.<p>From Chassis No. 1428255 (and RHD Chassis No. 1440121) the <a href="Montreal/Burman.GIF">screw linking the steering column to the steering box</a> of the Montreal was replaced by a new type 2100.14011 to reduce the danger of it loosening. Vehicles so equipped are identified by a blue paint mark on the steering box. Montreals with earlier Chassis Nos. were the subject of a factory recall for this modification in early 1974. <p>The casting of the Burman steering box tends to suffer from fatigue cracking, so that the use of wider front tyres may be inadvisable. Unlike the steering boxes of many other 105 series cars, the Burman box in the Montreal is not secured by through bolts with nuts. Instead, the three mounting lugs are fitted with helicoils into which 65mm long M10 x 1.25mm 2100.02044 bolts are screwed. As fracture of the lower front mounting lug is not uncommon, it may be desirable to unwind the helicoil in it and replace the bolt by a longer one with a nut and large washer to spread the load.<p>Greek Montreal owner <a href="mailto:gtvoula (at) yahoo.com">Manos Protonotarios</a> manufactured a series of <a href="Montreal/ManosBox.jpg">reproduction steering boxes</a> having <a href="Montreal/NewvsOld.jpg">greater wall thickness than the original design</a>. These boxes were supplied with a preassembled grooved bushing, one oil seal and three gaskets. The reproduction boxes were cast from the aluminium alloy of old Alfa Romeo 4-cylinder engine blocks and the entire production has now been sold. If the engine is jacked up a little the steering box can be replaced from below. Manos recommended the use of steel reinforcing plates (2mm thick <a href="Montreal/ISBplate.jpg">inside</a>, 3mm thick <a href="Montreal/OSBplate.jpg">outside</a>, with these <a href="Montreal/SBplateDimens.pdf">dimensions</a>).<p><a href="mailto:jaatinen (at) aref.fi">Timo Jaatinen</a> reports that one lug of his Montreal steering box broke after failure of the spot welding of the chassis member to which it is attached.

Timo <a href="Montreal/SteeringBoxParts.jpg">dismantled the steering box</a> to allow it to be repaired by welding, which requires heating it to 400 deg C.

Different versions equipped with <a href="Montreal/TRendComp.jpg">castellated nuts and nyloc nuts</a> have been found with the same Part No. The nyloc nut version may be longer, as there should be a minimum of 3 threads above the nut. Hence the version secured by castellated nuts is preferable for the Montreal track rod ends that have a <a href="Montreal/TRend.jpg">limited clearance</a> from the chassis members.<p>At least 10 different steering wheels and 6 different horn controls were fitted to 105/115 series cars. (See the "Horns" section for Montreal horn control variants). The wood-rimmed Hellebore steering wheel of the Montreal (105.64.23.051.00) was also fitted to the 2000 Berlina, equipped with the same black hub cover carrying a gold-backed transparent plastic emblem. As an alternative, a <a href="Montreal/MontiWheel.jpg">more colourful metallic emblem</a> can be fitted to the hub cover and 40 mm diameter emblems having a suitable surface curvature can be supplied by <a href="http://www.okparts.net/">OKP</a> for EUR 8.50 each. <a href="mailto:japeng (at) mweb.co.za">Hannes Paling</a> reports that the steering wheel of the early 1970s Giulia coup&eacute; can be fitted to the Montreal. In addition to having a <a href="Montreal/2wheels.jpg">smaller diameter</a>, this steering wheel is less dished than the normal model.<p>The steering wheel can be difficult to remove. The hooks of a small gear puller can be adapted to fit in the three rectangular notches in the hub, or a puller equivalent to Alfa <a href="Montreal/A.3.0451.jpg">Special Tool A.3.0451</a> can be fabricated with studs which fit in the two diametrically opposite M5 holes.<p>The height of the Montreal steering wheel can be adjusted by elongating vertically the holes in the <a href="Montreal/StBracket.jpg">U-section steering column mounting bracket</a>.  When lowering the steering wheel (in which case hole A is slotted up and hole B slotted down) it may be found that the bracket is narrower near the upper corners than at the lower edges.  This can be accommodated by filing down the width of the <a href="Montreal/ColBrkt.jpg">alloy support casting at the level of hole A</a>.  After adjusting the steering wheel height, the plastic column jackets (shrouds) will require minor reshaping to obtain a good fit.  Warm the thermoplastic with a hot air blower until it just softens, and then remould the jackets by hand to the new shape required.

The antifreeze contains corrosion inhibitors and also raises the boiling point of the coolant to above 100 deg C. The coolant circuit should be flushed and the coolant renewed every 30,000km or 12 months, whichever comes first. The heater valve should be opened during this operation.<p>Minor errors were introduced when the owner manuals were edited between the different language editions. A pump bleed screw was added to the cooling system diagram on p. 57 of the December 1971 English version, altering system component references 16, 17 and adding 18. But the associated text was not fully updated, so that block drain plug 18 is referred to in the draining instructions as 17 (which is now the pump itself).<p>As the engine heats up, a wax-pellet thermostatic valve opens to allow coolant to circulate through the radiator. To prevent boiling, a thermostatic switch senses the temperature of the coolant in the radiator and energises the electric fan when it reaches 90-95 deg C. The electric fan (Bosch 0130701010) has the same <a href="Montreal/FanMotor.jpg">motor</a> and blades as the type that was fitted to some early 1970s Mercedes cars, and they can be transferred to the Montreal mounting bracket. <a href="mailto:fabio.grandi (at) unibo.it">Fabio Grandi</a> has found that the assembly fitted to the 1980's SAAB 900 (2.0L) is also compatible. <a href="Montreal/SaabFan1.jpg">This picture</a> shows the two fans in their respective shrouds (SAAB one on the right). <a href="Montreal/SaabFan2.jpg">Here</a> are the two motors with their fan blades, and <a href="Montreal/SaabFan3.jpg">this</a> is the SAAB assembly mounted in the Montreal shroud with the wiring adapted.<p>As with the electric window motors, <a href="Montreal/VentMagnet.jpg">detachment of the stator magnets</a> in the fan can cause sluggish operation or failure. <a href="mailto:stevehasic (at) optusnet.com.au">Steve Hasic</a> has successfully repaired two fan motors by securing the magnets back in position with epoxy.<p>Replacement <a href="https://www.partscollector.com/en/mostraArticolo.php?IDArticolo=7321">Sipea fan relays</a> are offered on eBay and are available from many suppliers, such as <a href="https://www.partscollector.com/en/">PartsCollector</a> in CH-6834 Morbio Inferiore, Switzerland, for about EUR 30. If original appearance is not important, they can be replaced by standard 12v 30/40A auto relays, which are cheaper and available from DIY motoring shops. See the "Fuses" section concerning the fan fuse, which is somewhat under-rated.<p>The temperature of the coolant is measured by a thermistor located towards the rear of the right cylinder head. The thermistor has a resistance of 120 ohms at 100 deg C. At the gauge graduations of 40, 80 and 120 deg C, the resistance is approximately 1200, 200 and 47 ohms respectively.<p>As the pressure in the circuit rises, coolant is expelled into the compensating reservoir via the spring-loaded sealing ring of the filler cap above the thermostatic valve. If the cap seal is compromised by wear or corrosion, air instead of coolant may be drawn back into the system when the engine cools. As a result, air and excessive coolant can be expelled through the reservoir the next time the engine is run. Very slight leaks at gaskets or coolant hose clamps can cause the same effect. On the other hand, a continuous stream of bubbles in the coolant while the engine is idling normally indicates leakage of combustion gases due to a cylinder head crack or a defective cylinder head gasket.<p>Replacement coolant hoses are available from several suppliers, such as <a href="http://www.afra.it/">AFRA</a>, <a href="http://www.ams-montreal-service.de/">AMS Montreal-Service</a>, <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> and <a href="http://www.haeckner.com/">G.

It can be advantageous to fit a separate fuel cooler if the car is to be driven in severe conditions at high altitude.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Grilles"><h4>Air grilles</h4></a><p>Ventilation air for the adjustable vents in the sidewalls of the cabin is ducted from ram air inlets behind the radiator grille.

The centre console and lower dashboard must be removed to take out the heater unit for repair. <a href="mailto:o.heinisch (at) aon.at">Oliver Heinisch</a> has written a <a href="Montreal/Heater.pdf">note (5.3MB PDF file)</a> about the procedure. The gear lever knob is a push fit and can be removed by turning and rocking it while pulling upwards.<p>The heater control valve is the same as that fitted to all 105-series cars, and leakage due to cracking or deformation of its synthetic mounting flange is quite common. Although some agility is required to access the valve, it is possible to replace it without removing the heater unit. A <a href="Montreal/HeaterValve.jpg">deformed mounting flange</a> can be repaired by bonding a new metal flange to the original one.<p>As illustrated in the owner manuals on p.18, the correct <a href="Montreal/Escutcheon.jpg">escutcheon plate</a> for the horizontally-pivoting heater control levers of the Montreal without air conditioning has the airflow direction arrows engraved vertically.

In fact the <a href="Montreal/TailUnit.jpg">Carello tail light units</a> fitted to Montreals are usually equipped with 3 separate bulb holders for these functions, one BA15s holder for a 25W stop light <a href="Montreal/RearLampsPC.jpg">flanked by a pair of BA9s holders for 4W parking lights</a> in each unit. Since there is no ground in the 4-contact tail light unit connector, and the ground through painted bodywork may be of uncertain integrity, a wire should be connected to the chassis from one of the 6 mm fixing bolts. <p>In some Montreals with amber lens front direction indicators, the front parking lamps are integrated in the outer headlamps instead of implemented by dual filament lamps (No. 1) in these indicators as shown in the documentation. 55W axial filament H1 type headlamp bulbs should be used for both the outer pair of dipped headlamps and the inner main beam pair.<p>Headlamps with tarnished reflectors can be replaced with BMW 325 ones. While the lenses for the main beam lamps are symmetrical, those for the outer lamps have different patterns for LHD and RHD cars.

In the raised position, the pneumatically-operated shelters preserve the aerodynamics and aesthetics of the body. Unlike conventional pop-up headlamp designs they allow the headlamp flasher to be operated without delay. For night driving, the shelters pivot downwards to clear the beams of all 4 headlamps entirely. <p>The <a href="https://www.sirai.com">Sirai</a> <a href="Montreal/EyelidValve.jpg">solenoid valve</a> which controls the vacuum lines from the headlamp shelter actuators is located in the nose of the vehicle. The nipples of the valve are numbered as follows.<p>Left side:<ul><li> <b>1</b> Line to the vacuum reservoir via the manual/automatic cock.<li> <b>2</b> Line from the rear of the left actuator (for raising eyelid).<li> <b>3</b> Line from the front of the left actuator (for lowering eyelid).<li> <b>4</b> Vent tube (from the dry air area behind the left inner headlamp and also connected to nipple <b>5</b> at the lower end of the valve).</ul><p>Right side:<ul><li> <b>2</b> Line from the rear of the right actuator (for raising eyelid).<li> <b>3</b> Line from the front of the right actuator (for lowering eyelid).</ul><p>The logic is:<ul><li> Lamps off = valve solenoid de-energised = vacuum on lines 2, vent tube to lines 3 = actuator pistons retracted = eyelids raised.<li> Lamps on = valve solenoid energised = vacuum on lines 3, vent tube to lines 2 = actuator pistons extended = eyelids lowered.</ul><p>In the case of a failure of the pneumatic mechanism, the eyelids can be lowered manually when the <a href="Montreal/ManAutoValve.jpg">control valve</a> attached to the vacuum reservoir is moved from the automatic to the manual position. This allows air to be drawn in through a port at the bottom of the valve.<p>When renewing the tubes be sure to use enough flexible hose at the actuator ends to allow the actuators to pivot as the pistons extend and retract. Although there are no entries in the modification record boxes, there are two versions of the relevant <a href="Montreal/Shelters.jpg">TAV 135</a> in the Montreal Parts Catalogues. In the earlier version, separate Part Nos. are given for all the flexible hoses and there is no designation on the generic tube A, while in the later version the global designation 3.34150.045.214 is used for all the flexible hoses "by the cm".<p>In the revised table the Part No. of the small B clips was changed from 105.51.04.435.00 to 105.64.04.435.00 and their number increased from 24 to 26. The reference to the large C clips changes from (2) to (1) and the Part No. of the solenoid valve is listed incorrectly (should be 105.64.65.097.00). The pages 407 and 408 disappeared from the revised TAV135 because they are no longer required.<p>Leaks in the vacuum system can lean the mixture in engine cylinder 4 (cylinder 8 for RHD cars) relative to the others, with a risk of piston damage due to lean detonation in that cylinder. <p>Minor leaks in the actuator diaphragms can be repaired with car tyre inner tube repair materials. <a href="Montreal/VHTdiaphragm.jpg">Reproduction diaphragms</a> can be supplied for USD 60 per pair plus postage by <a href="mailto:vhtrein (at) hotmail.com">Victor Hugo Trein</a>, Rua Altamira 35, Esteio-RS-Brazil, CEP 93265-070, or for EUR 45.01 each by <a href="http://www.ams-montreal-service.de/">AMS Montreal-Service</a>.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Ebuffers"><h4>Eyelid buffers</h4></a><p>Some Montreals are fitted with adjustable rubber buffers mounted on brackets on the outer headlamp frames, which limit the downward movement of the eyelids when they are opened.

Some cars were fitted with horns with <a href="Montreal/Jhorns.jpg">curved brass trumpets</a> painted hammer-finish grey, while others have <a href="Montreal/Klaxon.jpg">straight trumpets</a> of bright blue colour. <p>The air compressor, located with the horns in the nose of the car, can be accessed for lubrication with engine oil through the dipped forward section of the bonnet.  For improved access, remove the lower grille by prising it from the retaining spring clips after slackening the nut on the lowest stud behind the moulded <a href="Montreal/frame.jpg">central radiator frame</a>.  For full access, remove this frame with its grille entirely, followed by the left bumper and the mesh grille above it.<p>After slackening the locknuts the horns can be adjusted by screwing the trumpets in or out of the base units.  The air gap is fairly critical and no more than a half turn adjustment either way is needed.  Since the upper (TA) high-tone and lower (TB) low-tone units interact they must be adjusted together. Ear protection should be worn when testing the horns.<p>To prolong the life of the pneumatic horns they should be used as frequently as possible, as the air flow purges any contaminant particles or road salt.<p>Early Montreal steering wheels were fitted with a solid three-pronged horn control, which was also used for the Nuova Giulia Super 1300/1600. Later Montreals had a version with three levers which pivot individually, as fitted to the steering wheel of the 2000 Berlina. The earlier version horn control can be balanced by adjusting the three red-painted screws in the wheel hub. These screws are not present in the later version. When removing the large circlip to service the mechanism, watch out for the big compression spring which can fly out when it is released!<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Battery"><h4>Battery</h4></a><p>The Montreal 12v 65Ah battery is housed in a rather inaccessible <a href="Montreal/Battery.jpg">location</a> in the left rear corner of the boot.  The service instructions suggest that it should be removed for routine checking, which requires the disconnection of the connecting cables and the removal of the anchoring clamp and even the spare wheel!  This operation requires care to avoid lower back strain or car paintwork damage and in practice it may be more convenient to arrange a mirror and illumination to allow the battery to be serviced <i>in situ</i>. Such maintenance can be eliminated by the use of a sealed battery such as the <a href="http://www.oerlikon-automotive.ch/">Oerlikon</a> Multipower 6 MP 550/50-51. The detachable bottom cleats of this battery should be removed before installation in the Montreal. Note that some maintenance-free batteries which have calcium added to the electrodes to reduce outgassing can benefit from a rather higher charging voltage than traditional ones. <p>The battery tray accepts standard 175 x 278 mm cases and the right anchor clamp (in front of the battery) adjusts for any type of foot. However the securing clamp on the left side of the car (behind the battery) is a 13 cm long U-section fixed steel channel of internal dimensions 14 x 14 mm. Since the base of the battery when mounted on the tray is 5 mm above the deck, the battery foot must have a chamfered edge at a height of about 9 mm to engage this channel correctly. Some modern battery cases have a much higher foot which will not enter the channel. <p>Initially a <a href="Montreal/BattCover.jpg">battery protection moulding</a> was provided to cover the battery. Since the spare wheel must be lifted to remove it, the protection hinders access to the battery to such an extent that original covers are now rarely to be found! <a href="Montreal/ReproBattCover.jpg">Reproduction battery covers</a> can be supplied by <a href="http://www.partscollector.com/eng/">Ren&eacute; Richner</a>. It has been reported that, possibly because they are more rigid, the reproduction covers can be even more difficult to fit than the originals.<p>If a battery cover is not present, a protection must be fitted so that it is impossible for anything placed in the luggage compartment to cause a short circuit to the positive terminal of the battery.  <a href="mailto:springvalley.k (at) gmail.com">Ken Swanstrom</a> has fitted his Montreal with a <a href="Montreal/KSinstalled.jpg">battery protection</a> made from <a href="Montreal/KSpanel.jpg">1/4-in plywood</a>. The top of the panel is <a href="Montreal/KSscrews.jpg">secured by two screws</a> with fluted plastic heads, tapped into the rail above the battery opening, while the lower part is held in place by the spare wheel. To check the fit, the <a href="Montreal/KScoverDrg.jpg">drawing</a> could be copied on to cardboard before cutting the plywood. The plywood panel can also be used to mount a <a href="Montreal/KSextinguisher.jpg">fire extinguisher</a> bracket.<p>In addition to the 4.5 mA of the clock, the <a href="Montreal/Flasher.jpg">flasher control unit</a> (which is powered at all times to allow the hazard warning lights to be used even when the ignition is switched off) has a continuous drain of 7.5 mA. The memory circuits of some autoradios may add another 8 mA or so to the quiescent battery drain.  The total current of 20 mA will run down the battery of an unused vehicle in a few weeks.<p>It's important to note that even without this current drain unused car batteries self-discharge steadily, and that leaving a battery in a partially discharged state will reduce its capacity permanently. Hence if a classic car is not used for a lengthy period, the battery must be regularly charged with an external trickle charger. Modern chargers have an electronic controller that prevents overcharging if they are left connected to the battery for long periods. Lead-acid batteries should not be allowed to run down below 50% of their rated capacity or below a no-load voltage of 12v. To avoid any possibility of the vent valve blowing due to overpressure, it is preferable not to charge sealed batteries at above 14.1v.<p>  <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Alternator"><h4>Alternator</h4></a><p>The Montreal was equipped with a claw-pole Bosch K114V55A20 <a href="Montreal/K1alternator.jpg">alternator</a> with integral diode rectifier assembly and external voltage regulator. The Type No. 0120400714 that was fitted up to May 1974 and the earlier Type No. 0120400643 fitted after that date are interchangeable. (0120400714, which is labelled 643-714, includes the Bosch 1126600046 pulley and 1126610025 fan). <p>The tension of the alternator drive V-belt should be checked regularly and the belt should be replaced every 42,000 km. The 9.53 x 775 mm belt can be replaced by a Fiat Type 4434797. This should be done from above the car, removing the belt from the alternator pulley first and then from the crankshaft pulley. Reinstall the new belt first on the crankshaft pulley and, after adjusting the tension, lock the screw on the alternator support link and finally that on the pivot.<p>The speed step-up ratio from the engine crankshaft to the alternator is about 1:1.7. Hence the alternator rotor speed varies from about 1500 rpm when the engine is idling to almost 12,000 rpm when it is redlined. The alternator is rated to supply 55 Amps at a rotor speed of 6000 rpm, while the "20" in the type designation indicates that the current falls to 2/3 of the maximum (37 Amps) at 2000 rpm. The <a href="Montreal/BoschAltChar.jpg">performance characteristic</a> indicates that the alternator can supply 24 Amps at 1500 rpm.<p>In the case of a charging problem, check first that the drive belt tension is sufficient to prevent slippage. To determine whether the alternator or voltage regulator is at fault, the regulator connector can be removed and the D+ contact bridged to DF. After the engine is started, the voltage at the battery should increase from around 12.8v to 14.1v at an engine speed of 1500 rpm. (A speed of 2000 rpm should not be exceeded when carrying out this test). If the voltage does not rise to this value, the alternator is defective. Otherwise, the problem is with the regulator.<p>The resistance of the field winding of the alternator, measured from the DF contact to ground, should be 4 ohms +-10%. A high reading is likely to indicate a problem with the brushes. Spare parts for these alternators, such as brushes (Bosch 1127014009) and rectifiers (Bosch 1127320081) are readily available from sources such as <a href="http://www.woodauto.com/">Wood Auto Supplies</a>.<p>Alfa Romeo recommended that when a radio is fitted in a Montreal the alternator suppression capacitor should be changed from a 2.2 uF to a 3 uF one.<p>In order to cope with the demands of an increased electrical lighting load, <a href="mailto:mygoose (at) mindspring.com">Tom Sanor</a> has replaced the original alternator with an 80 Amp unit supplied by J.C. Whitney (Item No. WL268284) for USD 89.99. This appears to be a Delco-Remy 12-SI series 78 Amp machine, a popular model with integrated regulator that was used in many older GM vehicles. The alternator can be mounted in place of the original with suitable spacers and <a href="Montreal/12SIbracket.jpg">straightening of the upper support bracket</a>. The <a href="Montreal/12SIAltChar.jpg">12-SI performance curve</a> indicates that it provides somewhat lower output than the Bosch alternator at idling speed. However, a 94 Amp version of this alternator also exists (J.C. Whitney Item No. WL268285, USD 119.99) which can provide 33 Amps at 1500 rpm.<p>When installing a 12-SI alternator, the original Bosch voltage regulator should be removed and the green wire which was attached to contact D+ of the original alternator should be connected to the warning lamp contact #1 of the Delco-Remy one. The voltage-sense contact #2 of the new alternator is best connected to the battery connection at the starter solenoid but it may alternatively be bridged to the B+ terminal of the alternator.  <p><a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> has replaced the original alternator with a salvaged 105 Amp Delco-Remy CS-130 model. (Delco-Remy Part No. 1101310, AC Delco Part No. 321-385). This model, which was fitted to 1988-90 Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Pontiacs equipped with the 3.8 l V6, is believed to have a similar performance characteristic to the later <a href="Montreal/CS130DAltChar.jpg">CS-130D</a>, which can provide 48 Amps at 1500 rpm. The CS-130 is fitted with a poly-groove pulley but the original pulley from the Bosch alternator can be transferred to it.<p>To mount the CS-130, the lower mounting bracket can be drilled out for a 10 mm bolt or the alternator hole can be sleeved to allow the original 8 mm bolt to be used. A 5 mm spacer is required at the <a href="Montreal/CS130mountL.jpg">lower mounting point</a> and a 10 mm spacer and longer mounting bolt at the <a href="Montreal/CS130mountU.jpg">upper bracket</a>, to allow the bracket to be positioned in front of the alternator. Alternatively the upper bracket could be flattened so that it would fit behind the mounting ear of the alternator. Note that different versions of the CS-130 may have mounting ears with different dimensions and orientations other than 6-12 o'clock. In addition to the main BAT terminal, which connects to the red wire in the Montreal, the CS-130 has a connector with <a href="Montreal/CS130alternator.jpg">S, F, L and P terminals</a>. When running at speed, the alternator is self-excited. To provide battery excitation of the field at low speed, the green wire which connected to the D+ input to the Bosch alternator should be connected to the L terminal of the CS-130. The F and P terminals can be left open while the S terminal, which is used for remote sensing, can be connected to the battery supply at the starter solenoid. <p><a href="mailto:dave.bramwell (at) huskyenergy.com">Dave Bramwell</a> has replaced the original alternator with a 65 Amp Bosch AL 25X model, which has an internal voltage regulator. To mount this alternator, <a href="Montreal/AL25X.jpg">the upper mounting bracket</a> must be shortened by about 3 cm and the slot in it widened by 1 mm. The lower mounting bracket does not require modification and the original drive belt can be used.<p><a href="mailto:rdd64287 (at) mail.telepac.pt">Joseph Santos-Fernandes</a> has replaced the alternator with a generic type sold under the Lucas brand name.

This model was fitted to other vehicles in the 1970s and replacements are still available. The resistance from the D+ contact of the regulator to ground (D-) should be about 85 ohms, 36 ohms for the solenoid and 49 ohms for its series compensating resistor.<p>A plug-compatible version (0190600006) of this voltage regulator with additional radio interference suppression components was also made. These electromechanical regulators have a range of 13.7 - 14.6v and at 20 deg C typically charge at about 14.1v. When replacing the regulator, Bosch recommend fitting type 0192062007, a simple transistor model which has the same physical dimensions and is adjustable over the range 13.9 - 14.9v. <p>The ideal charging voltage depends on the electrode chemistry of the battery used and its temperature. A higher voltage is desirable at low temperatures and to fully charge "maintenance-free" batteries which have calcium added to the electrodes to reduce outgassing. To avoid battery overheating, or having to top up frequently with water, a lower voltage is more appropriate for traditional lead/antimony batteries or at elevated operating temperatures. To avoid the vent valve blowing due to overpressure, sealed batteries should not be charged at above 14.1v.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Ammeter"><h4>Ammeter</h4></a><p>The ammeter in the Montreal left instrument pod indicates the current flowing to (+) or from (-) the battery, with the exception of that drawn by the starter motor and the horns.<p>During normal running, the ammeter should register a small positive current flow, indicating that the alternator is supplying the electrical loads of the car and charging the battery. A high positive reading would indicate either a battery that has been discharged, a defective battery, or a faulty voltage regulator causing the alternator output voltage to be too high. A negative reading, on the other hand, would indicate that the alternator is not able to supply all the electrical loads at the current engine speed.

A 15 Amp fuse (2600.70502) may be installed in the "<a href="Montreal/FuseLabels.jpg">Elettroventola</a>" position since it provides adequate protection for the 2.5 mm2 wiring used in this circuit.

When the starter solenoid is energised by the ignition switch, the pinion is engaged with the flywheel ring gear by a thrust lever and main battery power is applied to the motor. The ring gear, of overall diam 298 mm, has 140 teeth and the pinion, of diam 25.4 mm, has 9 teeth, giving a reduction ratio of 15.555... A roller-type overrunning clutch decouples the pinion from the starter to protect it when the engine fires. Replacement parts for the starter motor, such as <a href="http://www.woodauto.com/Component.aspx?Ref=SBR5620L">brush sets</a> and <a href="http://www.woodauto.com/Component.aspx?Ref=WSA1873">armatures</a>, are readily available.

The socket can be of the standard removable cigar lighter type, for which fused plugs are readily available for accessories which are not already equipped with them at origin. <p>  <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Windows"><h4>Electric windows</h4></a><p>Most Montreals were equipped with electrically operated side windows, an option which added DEM 660 to the cost of the car in Germany and CHF 800 in Switzerland. An emergency <a href="Montreal/Crank.jpg">crank handle</a> was provided to allow the windows to be operated in the event of a failure in their electrical drive mechanism. 140 full turns from top to bottom!  Depress the side locking spring on the crank to extract it after use. The crank may be <a href="Montreal/CrankStore.jpg">stored</a> in the vehicle glove compartment. A batch of <a href="Montreal/ReproCrank.jpg">reproduction crank handles</a> was produced  by <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a>. The window crank of the GTV6 may also be suitable for the Montreal.<p>For safety reasons, a relay prevents the windows being operated unless the ignition switch is turned on. An <a href="Montreal/WindOverRelay.jpg">overcurrent relay</a> greatly reduces the motor current and torque when the windows reach their limits or encounter an obstruction. Once energised, the relay contacts are held open until the operating switch is released. This is achieved by a reduced current passing through a hold-in coil with a resistance of 22 ohms. Sluggish action of the mechanism can be caused by excessive friction between the glass and the guides. The channel moulding can be lubricated with silicone spray or soap, and should be checked for any distortion that could hinder movement.<p>One can appreciate the descending speed of the electric windows of a new Montreal at around 4m43 - 4m46 into the 1972 Greek movie "<a href="Montreal/RansomBabyPoster.jpg">Ransom Baby</a>", which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A-ljzpH4lk">available on YouTube</a>. One of the causes of sluggish window operation is the voltage drop through the overcurrent and ignition interlock relays. If you don't mind bypassing these functions, you can make the window drive more perky by bridging one or both of them. To bypass the interlock, connect the heavy wires to contacts 87 and 30/51 together. To bypass the overcurrent relay, connect the two heavy wires to it together. i.e., to bypass both functions, connect the heavy wire to contact 87 on the interlock relay directly to ground.<p>Note that in making these modifications you are bypassing safety features, so you do so ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. If the ignition interlock is bypassed, the window switches will still be operational when the ignition is switched off. If the overcurrent relay is bypassed, you will have to be sure to release the operating switch as soon as the window is fully up or down, and there is no protection if, for example, a child were to get their fingers caught in the window.<p>A more radical approach is to bypass the multiple connections in the original wiring by energising the window motors via relays connected directly between the fusebox and the motors. The relays can be controlled by the original power window switches and the circuit protected by an auto-reset circuit breaker. <a href="mailto:alfagene@att.net">Gene Brown</a> has developed a <a href="Montreal/WindowRelays.jpg">kit of relay modules</a> that can be fitted to the motor wiring connectors in the footwells. The cost of the complete plug-in kit for both windows, including wire harnesses and fitting instructions, is USD 180 plus shipping.<p>The stator magnets are secured inside the motor shell by glue. In the case of poor motor performance, check that the magnets have not become detached and moved out of position. Alfa supplied replacement motor, drive and cable as a complete assembly (105.64.55.030.40 right side, 105.64.55.031.40 left side). While <a href="Montreal/WindowMotor.jpg">NOS parts</a> are still to be found, they are quite expensive as this part is unique to the Montreal.

The nearest equivalent Bosch wipers in current production are Part No. 3 397 118 610. Satisfactory <a href="Montreal/MyWipers.jpg">substitutes for the original wipers</a> are 41 cm <a href="Montreal/ArmanWiper.jpg">Arman Type 0.13.630 67A</a> which are manufactured today as replacement parts for 1970- Alfettas. Note that Arman Type 0.13.620.64A, although marked on the package as being suitable for the Montreal, are not in fact appropriate as they have 7 mm instead of 9 mm clips.

After disconnecting the feed hose at the coupler nipple and removing the securing hardware the shield can then just be manoeuvred out from under the lower windscreen panel.  The plastic hose becomes brittle with age and should be replaced with new 4 mm ID PVC tubing to prevent leakage into the heater inlet.<p>Spurious windscreen wiper sweeps could be caused if the carpet in the driver's footwell is not positioned to clear the windscreen washer foot switch. <p>The wiper controller (component 39 on the wiring diagram) is a Bosch <a href="Montreal/WiperContl.jpg">0 335 320 001</a>. It is secured by a single screw under the glove box, just to the left of the right side ram air vent, and has short cables to an 8-pin AMP connector, of which 7 contacts are used for the switches, and a 6-pin connector, of which 5 contacts are used for the motor. <p>The windscreen wiper motor is a dual-speed Bosch 0 390 346 087 model. A defective motor may be directly replaced with that from an Alfa Romeo 75 (Milano) with no changes other than the wiring connector.

Replace with a 30 mm M8 stud having a maximum thread length on the manifold side of 10 mm.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Idling"><h4>Idling</h4></a><p>Idling adjustments should be made only <i>after</i> the engine tuning, throttle, timing and Spica setup have been completed, the operating mixture having been optimised with the <a href="#FCS">Spica FCS</a> at 2500 rpm. The Spica will then deliver the correct idling fuel rate, and it is only necessary to adjust the idling airflow. Do not be tempted to adjust the throttle stop to set the idle speed. When idling after warmup, the throttle butterflies should be just <i>closed</i> and the engine should breathe entirely through the idling air tubes. During the engine warmup phase, the Spica control arm holds the throttle butterflies slightly open to obtain a satisfactory idle. A defective Spica TA can cause high idling speed if its plunger does not project sufficiently to allow the idle limit screw to rest on the stop after warmup. In the absence of an exhaust gas analyzer (see <a href="#Emission">Emission</a> section) adjust the idling air for the highest idle speed which does not result in roughness or hunting due to an over-lean mixture.<p>Excessively high idle speed after a period of fast running can be caused by the ignition timing failing to return to full retard. After many years the grease in the mechanical advance mechanism <a href="Montreal/Dist2.jpg">tends to clog</a> and the mechanism should be cleaned and lubricated from time to time to avoid sluggish operation. Note that the engine idle speed of a Montreal fitted with an air conditioner should be set with the compressor in operation. The English version of the Shop Manual describes idle adjustment "on the beach" (a pleasant alternative to on the bench?).<p>Ensure that the idling air tubes are <a href="Montreal/Injectors.jpg">routed</a> such that they cannot be squeezed between the air cleaner box and the fuel injector lines, pinching off the idling air supply for one of the cylinders. In the case of high idling speed, possibly varying with temperature, check for leaks in any of the idling air tubes or a defective equaliser O-ring.<p>The earlier type of Montreal idling air equalizer mounted at the rear of the air cleaner box is provided with a single adjustment screw to allow the idling airflow to be regulated.  With the later twin equalizers mounted on the air intakes the idling air is controlled by the adjustment of the inlet pipe union, which compresses an O-ring in each equalizer block, and by the size of the apertures communicating with the intakes to the air cleaner box. The latter may be varied by punching central holes of different diameters (typically 3.5 - 5 mm) in the equalizer block mounting gaskets. In this case I recommend overdrilling the (nominally 5 mm diameter) holes in the air intakes to ensure that the gasket hole diameter is determinant and the overall apertures are balanced on the two sides of the engine despite centering tolerances. When testing the engine with the air cleaner box removed, the gaskets should be attached to the equaliser blocks so that the resistance to airflow is the same as when the equaliser blocks are mounted on the air intakes.<p>The condition of the O-rings should be monitored as particles from them can partially obstruct the idling air channels if they begin to disintegrate. If this prevents a cylinder from firing during idle the resultant flooding may prevent it from firing when the throttles are opened also. <a href="Montreal/IdlerRing.jpg">Replacement O-rings</a> can easily be cut from 3.5 mm thick synthetic rubber that will be stable with time and temperature. The external diameter is about 12.5 mm. The central hole diameter will depend on the compressibility of the material - I suggest punching 2 mm diameter to start with and increasing the diameter (to a maximum of 5 or 6 mm) until screwing the pipe union in and out gives a smooth idling adjustment. Replacement O-rings can be supplied by <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a>, and the O-ring 53400 offered by <a href="http://www.international-auto.com/">International Auto Parts</a> for the Spica-injected 1750 GTV may also be suitable for the Montreal. Ensure that the washer is mounted on the outer side of the O-ring, not the inner side, so that screwing in the pipe union can force the O-ring into the tapered section to compress it radially.  <p><a href="mailto:bergeb (at) online.no">Berge Bergesen</a> reports that the earlier type of adjuster can be made more reliable by modifying the <a href="Montreal/Idlerscrew.jpg">adjustment screw</a> and dispensing with the O-ring.

It has been found that the original Tecnocar B-64 <a href="Montreal/B64filter.jpg">fuel tank filter element</a> (105.64.32.026.01) tends to soften and disintegrate with time. Tiny paper particles can then enter the fuel lines and lead to a blockage.  Alfa Romeo recommended that the filter element should be replaced by the <a href="Montreal/B64felt.jpg">later type</a> (105.64.32.026.02, GR Code 60716130) made of felt and, if the original shows any signs of deterioration, the fuel lines should be thoroughly cleaned out. Modern paper filter elements do not suffer from this problem. They can be supplied by <a href="Montreal/Muller.html">M&uuml;ller Service</a> in Switzerland (CHF 45 each) and from <a href="http://www.haeckner.com/">G. H&auml;ckner</a> for EUR 31.90. Coarser metal gauze filter elements are not suitable. <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> can supply tank filter elements with a moulded neoprene seal for GBP 27.50. Reproduction <a href="Montreal/FilterGasket.jpg">gaskets</a> are available from <a href="Montreal/Muller.html">M&uuml;ller Service</a>.<p>The fuel tank should be emptied by removing the outlet union before removing the <a href="Montreal/TankFilterFlange.jpg">tank filter flange</a>. While the fuel is drained for replacement of the tank filter element, check that the 2.4 mm diameter <a href="Montreal/FuelOrifice1.jpg">restrictor orifice</a> in the return line has not become blocked, impeding proper fuel circulation. New copper sealing rings of about 1.5 mm thickness (16.2 x 22.4 mm for the supply, 12.2 x 18 mm for the return) should be fitted when the banjo bolts are replaced.<p>Replacement <a href="Montreal/FiltElement.jpg">elements</a> (105.50.04.600.00, GR Code 60715010) for the <a href="Montreal/Filter.jpg">main fuel filter in the engine compartment</a> are readily obtainable (<a href="Montreal/UFIFuelFilter.jpg">Universal Filter Italiana 26.617.00</a>, FISPA 1584, FIAAM FA 4205/2, FRAM C4518, Purolator LI 1584) for about CHF 20, and should be changed frequently to protect the very fine tolerances in the Spica pump. In 1973 the original filter assembly (105.64.04.060.00, GR Code 60715664) was replaced by a <a href="Montreal/FuelFilter.jpg">modified unit</a> (105.64.04.060.01, GR Code 60715665) with water separation properties. This type should be checked for water collection at intervals and emptied.<p>The sealing washer on the retaining bolt "A" (originally 2340.32232, later 105.64.04.060.01/06 - GR Code 60715669) should be renewed when the filter housing is opened and the bolt retorqued to 1.6 mkg without lubrication of the washer. Replacement 80mm dia main seals for the filter canister are provided with the filter elements supplied by <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> and <a href="http://www.ams-montreal-service.de/">AMS Montreal-Service</a>. Use a mirror to verify that the seal is correctly seated and check for leakage after replacing the filter canister, as any leakage of fuel in the engine compartment is highly dangerous.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Fpumps"><h4>Fuel pumps</h4></a><p>The twin electric <a href="Montreal/FuelPumps.jpg">gasoline fuel pumps</a> fitted to the Montreal (<a href="Montreal/GFP274.jpg">GFP274</a>) are <a href="Montreal/BoschBox.jpg">Bosch type 0 580 970 001</a> or 0 580 970 003. (One of each type may be found fitted to some vehicles). The 001 version usually has a <a href="Montreal/Pump001.jpg">square pump housing</a> whereas the 003 version, which included a <a href="Montreal/003Clamp.jpg">securing clip</a> that is not required for the Montreal, has a <a href="Montreal/Pump003.jpg">round one</a>. The pumps operate at 2800 rpm at 12v, and each can deliver about 112 litres/hour (1 litre in 32 secs) at a pressure of 1.5 kg/cm2 (21.3 psi) at this voltage. The combined flow rate of the two pumps is required to ensure adequate cooling by fuel recirculation, especially when driving hard in hot weather with a low fuel tank. <p>Both fuel pumps must be in good order to ensure that adequate fuel recirculation can be maintained at high engine rpm. Each pump draws 2.5 Amps at 12v. The <a href="Montreal/FPwires2.jpg">electrical connections</a> must be sound and to minimise voltage drop it can be advantageous to run a separate ground wire to the pumps directly from the battery connection to the chassis. The nominal working fuel pressure at the input to the Montreal Spica pump is 1.5 kg/cm2 (21.3 psi), max 1.85 kg/cm2 (26.3 psi), somewhat higher than for 4-cylinder Spica systems (1.1 - 1.2 kg/cm2, 15.6 - 17.1 psi). The fuel pressure switch activates the warning light if the pressure falls below about 0.5 kg/cm2 (7.1 psi). Hence the warning light can indicate unduly low pressure caused, for example, by a blocked fuel filter. But the light off does not guarantee correct fuel pressure, and without such a blockage it will remain extinguished even if one of the two fuel pumps is not operating.<p>The multiple hose connections at the pumps should be checked regularly for leakage. To ensure a good seal, 9 mm ID hose should be used for the supply ports and 7 mm ID hose for the delivery and return ports of the pumps. Defective rubber mounts for the fuel pump clamp can be replaced by the oil tank mounts for Harley Davidson motorcycles.<p>To protect the pumps, it is important that the <a href="Montreal/TankFiltAssy.jpg">fuel tank filter</a> be in good condition. <a href="mailto:japeng (at) mweb.co.za">Hannes Paling</a> has found that a common cause of reduced performance can be contamination of the spring-loaded <a href="Montreal/PumpValve.jpg">valve</a> which controls the fuel flow from the <a href="Montreal/PumpPorts.jpg">Delivery (D) and Return (R) ports</a>. As well as opening the return port if the pressure exceeds about 2 bar, this valve acts as a stop valve on the delivery port when the pump is not running. The valve has been known to stick with the delivery port closed or with the return port open! This <a href="Montreal/ValveParts.jpg">picture</a> shows the valve components in the order of assembly, with a new aluminium end cap. After assembly, the parts can be <a href="Montreal/ValveClamp.jpg">clamped</a> to compress the rubber seal in the end cap and allow the cap to be crimped in position.<p>The <a href="Montreal/ImpellerGap.jpg">gap</a> between the impeller and the rollers should be about 0.35 mm. The O-ring is 29.87 mm ID x 1.78 mm diam, 70 shore hardness. When re-assembling the <a href="Montreal/PumpParts.jpg">pump parts</a>, the screws should be tightened while moving the front part of the pump around with the motor running until it sounds at its best. Commutator and brush wear is slight and the <a href="Montreal/PumpElec.jpg">electrical parts</a> of the pump are normally reliable.<p>If non-inflammable calibration fluid is not available when testing the fuel pumps out of the car, white spirit (Stoddard solvent) or paraffin oil (kerosene) can be used as it has a similar density to gasoline. Alternatively the pumps can be <a href="Montreal/PumpTest.jpg">tested while connected to the car</a> by extended fuel hoses and electrical connections. Before such testing, be sure to clean up any spilt fuel and ensure that the electrical connections and all hose clamps are secure. Have a second person check for fuel leaks immediately the ignition is turned on and keep a fire extinguisher to hand just in case!<p>The same Bosch pumps were fitted to certain fuel-injected Porsche 911s (Porsche type 901 608 105 00) and the Carrera 2.7 S, the Peugeot 504 TI and the US-spec Alfa 2000 Spider and 1975-1979 Alfetta. While <a href="Montreal/NewPump.jpg">new pumps</a> can still be supplied by some distributors, they can be very expensive. A new pump requires several hours running to bed in and deliver maximum flow rate. In the USA, leaking pumps can be rebuilt by <a href="http://www.fuelparts.com/">Fuel Parts</a> in Rancho Mirage, California. Rebuilt pumps can also be supplied by <a href="http://www.fuelinjectioncorp.com/">Fuel Injection Corporation</a> in Livermore, California (<a href="mailto:FIC_bob (at) sbcglobal.net">email</a>).<p>Beware new reproduction fuel pumps which are sometimes offered on eBay at greatly inflated prices. Although these <a href="Montreal/FpumpsSide.jpg">counterfeit pumps</a> may be <a href="Montreal/FpumpsBases.jpg">stamped with the Bosch logo and Part No.</a>, they are of inferior quality and may even have the ports in a different order from the Bosch originals. Hence if you buy pumps of unknown origin, be sure to test then fully before going to the trouble of installing them in the car.<p>Some Montreal owners have replaced the original twin pumps with a single fuel pump for an Alfa Romeo GTV6 or 75 (Milano). In view of the lower flow rate of the 75 pump, <a href="mailto:maxgilera (at) tele2.it">Max Gilera</a> fitted an adjustable <a href="Montreal/PressRegl.jpg">external pressure regulator</a> in the return fuel line from the Spica injector. While this allows the pressure at the input to the Spica to be raised to the nominal value, the lower flow rate reduces the cooling by recirculating fuel. <a href="mailto:vhtrein (at) hotmail.com">Victor Hugo Trein</a> fitted a pair of these pumps to ensure adequate cooling under all cirumstances.<p>Even with the pair of original pumps, <a href="mailto:peter.schweiss (at) ifp.fzk.de">Peter Schweiss</a> experienced fuel vapour problems under extreme conditions. He solved this by fitting his Montreal with an additional cooler in the return fuel line to the tank.<p>Walbro manufacture a single fuel pump (Type GSL392) which is capable of the same flow rate as the original pair. It is available as a kit (<a href="https://aftermarket.tiautomotive.com/projects/gcl611/">TI Automotive GCL611</a>) complete with <a href="Montreal/GCL611.jpg">sound insulator, mounting brackets and a choice of inlet and outlet fittings</a>. For safety reasons, any such fuel pump that only has a high pressure internal pressure relief valve should be fitted with an external one, plumbed to return excess fuel to the top of the fuel tank. <a href="mailto:bertmonty (at) yahoo.com">Jules Becker</a> has <a href="Montreal/GSL392instal.jpg">fitted his Montreal</a> with a GSL392 pump and an <a href="Montreal/WalbroPumpRegl.jpg">adjustable SimFlo bypass regulator</a>. <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a> can supply a <a href="Montreal/GPpumpKit.jpg">complete kit</a> comprising a Walbro GSL392 fuel pump and a suitable adjustable bypass pressure regulator of his own design, with all the fittings for interconnecting the parts and attaching the Montreal hoses.<p>In the Montreal the <a href="Montreal/FuelOrifice2.jpg">calibrated orifice</a> which controls the fuel pressure is located in the return inlet to the fuel tank (and not directly at the outlet of the Spica pump as in 4-cyl systems). The <a href="Montreal/FuelOrifice1.jpg">orifice</a>, which has a diameter of 2.4 mm, directs the recirculated fuel tangentially into the base of a centrifuge cylinder to promote devaporisation and cooling. For this reason, the orifice should not be removed or drilled out, even if the fuel circuit is modified.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Fgauge"><h4>Fuel gauge</h4></a><p>The fuel gauge is operated by the current flowing to chassis ground through the <a href="Montreal/FSender.jpg">level sender</a> in the fuel tank, whose resistance varies with the height of the float.

With age, cracks can occur in any of the hoses including those interconnecting the fuel pumps and the tank. Since the electric fuel pumps continuously circulate a large volume of fuel through the Spica injection pump for cooling purposes, a fuel line rupture in the engine compartment can result in a <a href="Montreal/MontiFire.jpg">serious deflagration</a>. The flexible hoses in the engine compartment should be of a type that has a smooth internal wall and resists fuel, temperature and pressure, such as <a href="https://shop.angst-pfister.com/ishop/product/node/14464/product/06.5324.02/article/06.5324.2010.xhtml">Angst+Pfister Benolpress Type 06.5324.2010</a>.

But it is light to operate and has a very smooth action.<p>Note that in Alfa Romeo Montreal literature the <a href="Montreal/ClutchDisc.jpg">clutch disc</a> is referred to as the "driven plate" while the <a href="Montreal/PressPlate.jpg">pressure plate</a> is called the "clutch". The <a href="Montreal/Rlsbearing.jpg">release bearing</a> ("throwout bearing") is the same as that fitted to most Alfa models of this vintage. Since it is continuously in contact with the diaphragm spring of the pressure plate, clutch wear is automatically taken up and no adjustment is required.<p>The clutch disc thickness when new is about 10 mm and the <a href="Montreal/ClutchWear.jpg">wear limit</a> is 7 mm. Clutch lifetime varies greatly with driving conditions but 100,000 km is not unusual for the Montreal. In the original 1971 edition of the Montreal parts catalogue a facing kit (105.64.12.032.01/50) for the clutch disc was illustrated but this was removed in the September 1973 revision when the clutch disc Part No. was changed from 105.64.12.032.01 to 105.64.12.032.03. The internal and external diameters of the clutch disc facing are 150.5 mm and 228 mm, while the corresponding dimensions of the machined surface of the pressure plate are 149.5 mm and 230 mm. <a href="mailto:sail4funsf (at) sympatico.ca">Jimmy Cornet</a> has reported receiving a replacement clutch disc of slightly larger diameter which tended to touch the casing.<p>The Part Nos of the clutch components are as follows:<ul><li> Clutch disc (F &amp; S 1861 412 102 Type 228) 105.64.12.032.03 (GR Code 60715782)<li> Pressure plate (F &amp; S 3082 023 031) 105.64.12.031.00 (GR Code 60715781)<li> Release bearing (F &amp; S 3151 001 001) 105.48.12.042.02 (GR Code 60516873)</ul><p>The Montreal clutch can be replaced from below the car by dropping the gearbox with the engine in place (see the following section). A mandrel equivalent to Alfa Romeo special tool <a href="Montreal/A.4.0133.jpg">A.4.0133</a> can be used to ensure that the clutch disc is accurately centred before fully tightening the pressure plate screws. With a team of three, <a href="mailto:phil (at) hehir.co.nz">Philip Hehir</a> has done <a href="Montreal/Philip6.jpg">clutch replacement at the side of a race track</a> in two hours. <p>Breakage of the clutch pedal pivot shaft (105.64.44.030.03) at the weld with the actuating lever is not uncommon. Compatible replacement pivot shafts are available from <a href="http://www.international-auto.com/">International Auto Parts</a> for USD 48.25 (Part No. 06751000). A replacement pivot shaft of stronger design can be supplied by <a href="mailto:ortak (at) knology.net">John Ortakales</a> for USD 60 plus shipping. <a href="mailto:Len_Leeb (at) sr.hp.com">Len Leeb</a> has described a <a href="Montreal/LenLeebClutchShaft.pdf">procedure for replacing the pivot shaft</a> without opening the hydraulic lines. Before breakage occurs, the joint between the shaft and the lever can be strengthened by welding on the inside of the lever where the shaft diameter is greater than on the outside. After breakage, it is difficult to ensure the correct orientation of the lever on the shaft to make a weld repair. The clutch <a href="Montreal/PedalCover.jpg">pedal cover</a> is the same as that fitted to all other 105-series cars and replacements are readily available at low cost. <p>While the clutch slave cylinder (105.64.12.050.00, ATE 03.2525-1901.3) has the same 1-inch (25.4 mm) bore as that fitted to many other Alfa Romeo models, the Montreal version has a longer 76 mm pushrod and a <a href="Montreal/ClutchSlaveCyls.jpg">longer cylinder</a> that permits a stroke of 17-19 mm, compared with 11 mm for the version for 4-cylinder cars. The more readily available shorter slave cylinder can (only just) be used as a replacement if it is fitted with a pushrod of length about 70-72 mm. The margin for tolerances is quite small. With a shorter pushrod, the piston will be near to projecting from the cylinder when disengaging a new clutch. With a longer pushrod, the piston may bottom in the cylinder before a used clutch has reached the wear limit.<p><a href="Montreal/GPclutchSlaveCyl.jpg">Replacement clutch slave cylinders</a> with the same length as the original can be supplied by <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a>. <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> can also supply a repro slave cylinder (MN014) of the correct dimensions that is made from aluminium alloy.<p>Alternatively, the original slave cylinder can be resleeved in brass by brake cylinder specialists such as <a href="http://www.brakecylinder.com">Sierra Speciality</a> (USD 50), <a href="https://whitepost.com/brake-sleeving-rebuilding-services/">White Post Restorations</a> or <a href="http://www.jlspares.co.uk/further.htm">J & L Spares</a>.

The ATE rebuild kit for the 4-cylinder car version of the slave cylinder is compatible with the longer version fitted to the Montreal.<p>The Montreal <a href="Montreal/ClutchMCs.jpg">clutch master cylinder</a> (ATE 03.2422-2801.3, Benditalia 6 06495) has a larger 7/8-inch (22.23 mm) bore than the 11/16-inch (17.46 mm) one (ATE 03.2417.0301.3) fitted to other 105-series cars. Since the original part is not easily obtainable, several vendors propose the 11/16-inch bore cylinder as a Montreal replacement. Its use will result in somewhat longer pedal travel and possibly marginal disengagement when the clutch disc is new. As with the clutch slave cylinders, the clutch master cylinders can be resleeved by <a href="http://www.whitepost.com/brake.html">White Post Restorations</a>.

For use in other vehicles, different versions of this gearbox were produced with a variety of gear ratios and with mechanisms for steering column and either central or <a href="Montreal/Gearbox1.jpg">set-back floor shift</a>. A lateral power take-off ('nebenabtrieb') option was also available for the version with central floor shift for use in light commercial vehicles. The versions of the gearbox fitted to Montreals were typically Ref 1255 003 019 or 1255 003 057 and the appropriate number should be quoted when ordering spare parts from ZF.<p>The gear ratios in any ZF box are indicated on a label on the left side. For the Montreal they were normally 2.99, 1.76, 1.30, 1.00 and 0.87:1, reverse 3.64 or 3.67:1. The differential ratio is 4.1:1 so that the overall drive ratio in 5th gear is 3.57:1. Much higher gear ratios are found in boxes of this type fitted to light commercial vehicles, while the version fitted to the Alfa 6 (which had a differential ratio of 4.55:1) had gear ratios 3.42, 1.94, 1.39, 1.00 and 0.795:1, reverse 3.66:1, and a shorter shift set-back. Early versions of the Maserati Biturbo (launched at end 1981) were fitted with a similar gearbox having ratios 3.42, 1.94, 1.39, 1.00 and 0.87:1, reverse 3.67:1, and an electronic instead of mechanical speedometer drive. For 195/70 VR14X tyres having an average circumference under load of 1.912 m, the theoretical relationship between road speed and engine speed for the Montreal in 5th gear is about 32.3 km/h per 1000 rpm (6800 rpm for 220 km/h).<p>Except when used with an engine tuned beyond the normal 200 bhp, the Montreal gearbox proves generally reliable. <a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> has experienced shift fork breakage, and premature wear of the <a href="Montreal/ZFRGIshaft.jpg">reverse gear idler shaft</a> (105.64.13.105.00/01) has been reported by several owners. The ZF Part No. of this shaft is 1255 305 027, not 1255 305 024 as indicated in the Montreal Parts Catalogue. While spare shafts are not always available in ZF stock, they can be manufactured to order for EUR 105 plus tax. Some spare parts can be purchased through the ZF national service station in your country. ZF also operate a worldwide "Virtual spare parts store" through which they claim that every spare part for any of their products is available by the web.

Tel. +4416977 41800.<p>In the Montreal Parts Catalogue, the ball bearings of the direct drive input shaft and the main output shaft are listed with the same Part No. (105.64.13.223.00/01, ZF Ref 0635 333 017). In fact, although they have the same dimensions, the input bearing (SKF 305604 B) is a four-point angular contact split-race type having a greater axial thrust rating than the output one (FAG 6306 N). When rebuilding the gearbox of his race Montreal, <a href="mailto:phil (at) hehir.co.nz">Philip Hehir</a> fitted the following gears: Input shaft - FAG QJ 306 MA, Layshaft - 30206A J2/Q, Output shaft - SKF 306NR, Mainshaft needle rollers - SKF K 23x35x16.<p>The Montreal version of the gearbox has an <a href="Montreal/GearboxPeg.jpg">additional peg</a> welded to the gear change extension which eliminates any possibility of contact with the rotating output flange.<p>ZF published a 35-page English language <a href="Montreal/ZFmanual.pdf">Assembly, maintenance and operating instructions manual (9MB PDF file)</a> for the S 5-18/3 gearbox. Original manuals (Ref 1255 751 101) may still be available from some national service stations of <a href="http://www.zf-group.de/special2.asp?lang=1">ZF Friedrichshafen AG</a>. Alfa Romeo's 44-page repair manual for the gearbox was published in several languages (DIASS No. 1853 for the Italian version - September 1972, DIASS No. 1854 for the <a href="Montreal/GboxManF.jpg">French version</a> - February 1974, DIASS No. 1856 for the German version - August 1973).<p>For service, the Montreal gearbox can be removed from below the car while leaving the engine in place. The gear lever knob is a push fit and can be removed by turning and rocking it while pulling upwards. After draining the gearbox oil, the gear lever should be taken off by removing the turret assembly from inside the car (4 bolts), applying protection to prevent residual oil spillage from the opening. The speedometer cable and attachment plates should be removed from the gearbox as well as the clutch slave cylinder, the distributor cap and the protective plate from the lower front of the bell housing. After removing the centre exhaust sections, the front of the engine should be jacked up as far as possible and the gearbox rotated to the right by about 90 deg to allow it to be dropped. The gearbox weighs about 33 kg. Conversely the engine, complete with the exhaust manifolds, can be removed while leaving the gearbox in place if it is jacked up slightly.<p>Reproduction Montreal gear lever knobs can be supplied by <a href="http://www.MtCarmelSpares.com">Mount Carmel Spares</a>. Note that the <a href="Montreal/MontrealShift.jpg">shift pattern</a> is quite different from that of other 105-series cars. The rubber boot (105.64.13.618.01) of the Montreal gear lever also differs. However, the straight version that was fitted to  several other models is only a little smaller in diameter and can be stretched to fit. The GB021 type supplied by <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> is suitable.<p>Minor oil leakage from the gearbox is quite common and Alfa Romeo recommended checking the level and topping up every 6000 km. A <a href="Montreal/ZFset.jpg">gasket and seal set</a> (Ref 1255 200 933 01) was produced by ZF, but it is no longer available from the manufacturer. It contains 1 large and 3 small gaskets, 2 copper sealing rings for the drain plugs, 1 large O ring for the speedometer bush, 6 small O rings for the selector fork pivots and 1 metal/synthetic output shaft and 1 synthetic input shaft oil seal. The large gasket goes between the two main sections of the gearbox housing. The gaskets for the rear (speedo) cover and the small front cover (centralising flange) are not included as they are now replaced by sealing compound such as ZF 7000 798 505 (30 ml tube).<p>Movement of the gear lever relative to the central console when driving can be caused by deterioration of the <a href="Montreal/GboxMount.jpg">gearbox support</a> (105.64.13.080.02). Reproduction supports can be supplied by <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a>, <a href="http://www.afra.it/english/index.asp">AFRA</a> and <a href="https://www.okp.de/xtc2/105-Montreal:::3485.html">OKP</a>.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Mounts"><h4>Engine mounts</h4></a><p>The Montreal engine mounts should be checked occasionally for deterioration of the rubber isolation.

The giubo has a long life but should be inspected regularly for cracks.<p>If special tool A.2.0315 is not available, a large hose clamp can be used to compress the giubo while it is being removed. The compression band of the replacement giubo should not be detached until it has been installed.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Propshaft"><h4>Propeller shaft</h4></a><p>Before removing the propeller shaft, mark the correct orientation of the yokes of the U-joints with paint. Never clamp the tubular part of the shaft in a vice as it is easily distorted. When reassembling the propeller shaft, ensure that the U-joints are correctly phased by <a href="Montreal/SlipJoint.jpg">aligning the arrows</a> stamped on each side of the slip joint. The yokes at each end of the shaft should be parallel to each other.<p>The centre bearing of the Montreal propeller shaft (105.39.15.123.00) is the same as that of other 105-series cars, but the <a href="Montreal/CentreBearing.jpg">bearing mounting</a> (105.64.15.127.00) has stiffer rubber than the 105.48.15.127.00 version fitted to these less powerful vehicles. The heavy-duty centre support (GB029) supplied by <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> is a suitable replacement. Before installing the support, ensure that the fixing hole positions allow it to be centred accurately.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Oils"><h4>Oils</h4></a><p>Relatively frequent oil changes are very desirable to prolong the life of a classic car like the Montreal. Before starting the oil changes, procure new copper sealing washers for all the fill and drain plugs. The sizes required are approximately:<ul><li>Sump drain 14 x 20 mm. (16 x 22 mm indicated in the Parts Catalogue)<li>Oil reservoir drain 23 x 28.5 mm<li>Spica oil filter 31 x 37 mm. (Not 10 x 14 mm as indicated in the Parts Catalogue)<li>Gearbox fill and drain 22 x 27 mm<li>Differential fill and drain 23 x 28.5 mm</ul>If a washer is not available, the original one can be re-used if it is annealed. Heat the washer with a torch until it becomes red, allow to cool and then remove surface oxide before installing.<p>All the oils should be drained when hot, taking appropriate precautions. The oil quantities required for refilling are approximately:<ul><li>Engine oil 10 l. (Note that the capacity of the <a href="Montreal/LubSystem.jpg">complete oil circuit</a> is over 12 l)<li>Gearbox oil 1.6 l<li>Differential oil 2.3 l</ul>Alfa Romeo recommended changing the engine oil and filter at intervals of 6000 km or 6 months. Montreal owners have reported satisfactory results with a wide variety of engine oils ranging from Castrol 15-50 to fully synthetic 10-40. For use in colder climates, a multigrade oil with a "W" (Winter) rating is recommended as it has specific cold-flow properties. Even for such a lubricant, the viscosity at 0 deg C can be about 30 times that at the operating temperature, so it is advisable not to exploit the engine fully until it has warmed up. In general it is best to use the narrowest viscosity span that is appropriate for the temperatures you will meet. I currently use <a href="Montreal/EngineOil.jpg">Mobil Super S 10W-40</a> semi-synthetic engine oil with <a href="Montreal/ZDDPflacon.jpg">ZDDPlus additive</a>. As oil tends to gravitate to the sump when the car is not in use, it is important to run the engine for a few minutues before checking the oil level with the reservoir dipstick. The sump plug takes a 19 mm socket wrench and the <a href="Montreal/TankHole.jpg">oil reservoir drain plug</a> a 12 mm or 14 mm hex key.<p>The low ZDDP levels in most modern oil formulations can be compensated by the addition of a little <a href="http://www.zddplus.com/">ZDDP additive</a> or <a href="http://www.lucasoil.com/products/display_products.sd?iid=82&catid=9&loc=show">assembly oil</a> at each oil change. Note that a high zinc concentration does not provide increased wear protection - it just provides protection for a longer time if the oil is being changed infrequently (which is not desirable).<p>Alfa Romeo recommended changing the gearbox oil at intervals of 18,000 km. Both the fill plug on the right side of the box and the drain plug at the bottom require a 19 mm socket. Alfa initially recommended the use of a monograde SAE 30 engine oil such as Shell Rotella T30. In December 1972 approval was given to Shell Rotella SX30. The viscosity of these oils is 10.9 cSt at 100 deg C, which corresponds to ISO viscosity grade 100, on the border between gear oil viscosity 80W and 85W. Shell Rotella oils are no longer sold in some countries and Shell Aseol (Switzerland) recommend the use of Shell Rimula X30 as a substitute. For proper synchromesh operation, it is probably unwise to use synthetic oils or any kind of friction-reducing additive in the gearbox. However, <a href="mailto:phil (at) hehir.co.nz">Philip Hehir</a> uses Redline Blue Schockproof oil in the gearbox of his racing Montreal. The <a href="Montreal/GearboxPlug.jpg">gearbox drain plug</a> is fitted with a magnet which should be cleaned with each oil change.<p>Alfa Romeo also recommended changing the differential oil at 18,000 km intervals, although this is less important than for the gearbox. A limited slip differential axle oil such as <a href="Montreal/Spirax90LS.jpg">Shell Spirax A 90LS</a> should be used. The fill plug takes a 12 mm or 14 mm hex key while the drain plug requires a 22 mm socket wrench. The <a href="Montreal/DifflPlug.jpg">drain plug</a> is fitted with a magnet which should be cleaned with each oil change.<p>The Spica pumping elements are lubricated by fuel and premature wear has been attributed to the fuel formulations that were made at the beginning of the unleaded era. While there is no confirmed evidence of its utility, some owners add a little <a href="Montreal/MMOil.jpg">Marvel Mystery Oil</a> to the fuel with the objective of adding some lubrication. While this should not be necessary with modern fuel formulations, it should do no harm either. MMO consists of about 75% naphtha and 25% white spirit (Stoddard solvent), with less than 1% benzene and a trace of wintergreen oil for fragrance.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Oilfilt"><h4>Oil filters</h4></a><p>Suitable main engine oil filters for the Montreal are quite readily available. The same disposable cartridge type was fitted to many 4-cylinder 105-series 1300, 1600 and 2000 cars, with the exception of the 1300 Giulia TI, Giulia Super, GT Junior and Spider Junior, the 1600 Giulia Super and the 1750 models, which had a canister with renewable element. Compatible Alfa Romeo oil filter types include the 96 mm diam <a href="Montreal/Filter1.jpg">60507080</a> (116.44.06.030.0), 60522155 (116.46.45.050.00) and 109 mm diam <a href="Montreal/Filter2.jpg">60521128</a> (116.00.06.030.99), while the Crossland 484, K&N HP-2004 and <a href="Montreal/PH2941.jpg">FRAM PH2941</a> can also be used. US owners have reported satisfactory results with FRAM HP1 and PH8A filters, the AC Delco PF-20, the K&N HP-1002, the Baldwin B253 and Purolator models L20081, L20017 and L20020. FRAM PH16, TG16 and XG16 filters can also be used. 96 mm diam filters can be replaced from the top, whereas larger filters must be replaced from below the car after lowering the anti-roll bar.<p>Before turning over a rebuilt engine allow time for oil from the tank to run down to prime the delivery pump. Prime the recovery pump by adding oil to the return hose at the input to the thermostatic bypass valve at the left side of the oil cooler. It can be prudent to <a href="Montreal/PressGauge.jpg">attach an oil pressure gauge to the filter housing</a> and crank the engine without spark plugs until pressure is registered.<p>In spite of the protection provided by the oil filter, <a href="mailto:trentcars (at) lineone.net">Mal Nicholson</a> has reported finding an oil pressure release valve blocked by debris. The debris, consisting of small flakes of rubber which may have been shed by the interior walls of the flexible oil hoses, prevented the valve opening and resulted in very high oil pressure. Contamination of the oil circuit can also arise from particles shed by the timing chain guides, which tend to disintegrate with age. <a href="mailto:phil (at) hehir.co.nz">Philip Hehir</a> has reported a similar blockage of the pressure relief valve by metallic debris.<p>Replacement oil hoses for the Montreal (105.64.31.901.01/902.00), which have DIN standard size LX18 fittings, can be fabricated by some local specialist hydraulic shops. <a href="mailto:steve.merrihew (at) lmco.com">Steve Merrihew</a> has reported that a 45-degree fitting cannot be used as a replacement for the original 30-degree fitting at the oil reservoir. Some hydraulic shops which do not stock the fittings can transfer the original ones to new hoses. <a href="mailto:rugh (at) jhu.edu">Jack Rugh</a> had this done by Lonsdale and Holtzman in Baltimore for USD 55. <a href="Montreal/OilHose.jpg">New oil hoses</a> can be supplied by <a href="http://www.partscollector.com/eng/">Ren&eacute; Richner</a>.<p>The Spica injection pump lubricating circuit has an additional oil filter which is <a href="Montreal/SpicaF.jpg">integrated with the front support of the pump</a>. Alfa Romeo specified replacement of this filter at 42,000 km intervals. Original Tecnocar OP50 replacement <a href="Montreal/SpicaFilter.jpg">oil filter elements</a> (105.64.04.082.00, GR Code 60715683) are difficult to procure but satisfactory  <a href="Montreal/SpicaRefabFilt.jpg">refab filters</a> have been produced. The overall length of the filter (including its sealing ring) should be about 48 - 48.5mm. Some longer repro filters have been found. The securing plug requires a 32 mm socket wrench. When replacing the filter, lightly grease the end of the spring to ensure that the element is not twisted when the plug is tightened.  Note that the filters are not the same as for 4 cylinder Spica pumps.<p>A check valve above the Spica filter prevents oil draining back from the pump. A stuck valve or blocked filter can cause <a href="Montreal/SpicaCamDamage.jpg">damage</a> to the <a href="Montreal/SpicaShaft.jpg">main shaft of the pump</a>. The control section of the pump is not included directly in the pressure lubrication circuit and after replacing the filter, some engine oil should be added to it through the TA hole. To completely refresh the oil in the control section, it may be sucked out through the BC hole with a pvc tube attached to a syringe. The total capacity of the control section is about 250 ml but any excess drains back to the engine.<p>The strainers in the oil reservoir and at the entrance to the intake duct in the sump do not normally require routine maintenance. (They have a wide mesh intended to protect the engine from foreign objects). The filters in the reservoir may also promote devaporisation. The 22 mm hex socket of the oil reservoir strainer can be unscrewed with a normal 18 mm box spanner.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Separator"><h4>Oil separator</h4></a><p>The Montreal engine draws blow-by gases and oil vapour from the crankcase and oil reservoir into the <a href="Montreal/OilSeparator.jpg">oil separator</a>, where the oil is separated by centrifugal action and returned to the main lubrication circuit. When the throttles are open, the gases are drawn into the intake manifolds via the air cleaner for combustion. When the engine is idling, the gases enter the idling airstream via the equaliser block(s). Different versions of the separator were fitted to engines having a single rear equaliser block and those having twin side blocks.<p>The oil separator requires little maintenance. From time to time it should be checked that the internal passages are clean and free from corrosion and that the connecting hoses are unobstructed. Access to the far side M6 fixing bolt is facilitated by removing the Spica drive belt cover. The length of this bolt is somewhat critical. To avoid an oil leak, ensure that it does not bottom before the gasket has been compressed.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Sump"><h4>Oil sump</h4></a><p>With the stock suspension, the ground clearance below the oil sump is about 14.5cm. Cracks can be repaired by specialist welders, such as <a href="mailto:info (at) frey-schweisstechnik.de">Schweisstechnik</a> in Germany, or by cold weld products.<p>To avoid stripping the threads, the sump drain plug should not be overtightened. <a href="mailto:d.dunkling (at) btinternet.com">David Dunkling</a> has effected a successful repair by retapping the hole for a 3/8 BSPT (British Standard Pipe Taper) 14tpi pressure plug. He avoided removing the sump by pouring oil into the reservoir to wash out the swarf during the repair.<p>A <a href="Montreal/ReproSump.jpg">reproduction oil sump</a> for the Montreal has been produced in Germany by <a href="mailto:achimagne (at) gmail.com">Achim Agne</a>, who created a CNC program by measuring the original sump completely. The sump is made from AlMg4.5Mn aluminium alloy, and the surface is anodised black. Achim could produce a small series of them if required.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Heads"><h4>Cylinder heads</h4></a><p>The original height of the Montreal cylinder heads (measured between the surfaces mating with the cylinder head and cam cover gaskets) is 120.5 +0 -0.1 mm and the maximum acceptable re-grinding depth for flattening is 0.2 mm. If the maximum tolerance is reached, the peripheries of the combustion chambers should be re-chamfered to avoid possible piston interference with the cylinder head at TDC. Italian Montreal owner <a href="mailto:michele.judica (at) tin.it">Michele Judica</a> reports having successfully reduced the height to 119.9 mm without having to modify the pockets in the pistons. Using a professional lab tool, <a href="mailto:a.duiven (at) oosterhuis.info">Arnoud Duiven</a> has obtained combustion chamber volume measurements of 34.0, 34.6 and 35.0 cc on a cylinder head of standard height (with spark plugs and valves in place). The pistons have a dome height of 3 mm above the top of the liners and occupy a volume of 5 cc.<p>While it is easier to remove the cylinder heads with the engine out of the car, this is also possible in situ. The engine should be jacked up a little after disconnecting the front engine mounts. Reproduction engine mounts can supplied by <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> and <a href="mailto:achimagne (at) gmail.com">Achim Agne</a>. Some of the exhaust header nuts are quite difficult to access. <a href="mailto:dirkvanrompaey (at) yahoo.com">Dirk Van Rompaey</a> made a <a href="Montreal/HeaderWrench.jpg">right-angle 13mm wrench</a> to access the forward nut of cylinder 4.<p>Alfa Romeo emphasized that correct cylinder head tightening procedures are very important for the Montreal's high performance engine.  The three procedures detailed in the Owner Manuals are those which were carried out on the factory assembly line in series production.  They should be repeated after removal of the cylinder heads (when the cylinder head gaskets must also be replaced) but the sequence as described is <i>incomplete</i> and additional operations are necessary at later times as indicated here. (Note that the final operation is procedure <b>B</b>, <i>not</i> procedure <b>C</b>)<ul><li> <b>A</b> With a cold engine and lubricated cylinder head studs, nuts and washers, tighten to 7.7 - 7.9 mkg in the <a href="Montreal/HeadSeq.jpg">recommended sequence</a>. As you approach the target torque go round the sequence repeatedly applying only a small torque increment to each nut. <li> <b>B</b> Warm the engine by actually driving the car for 15 minutes and then (without slackening the nuts) torque to 8.1 - 8.2 mkg.<li> <b>C</b> With a cold engine drain off some of the coolant so that it will not run along the studs (which can alter the torque).  Then, again following the recommended sequence, slacken each nut (one at a time) by at least 1.5 turns, oil between the nut and washer and retorque to 7.7 - 7.9 mkg. <p></ul>700-1200 km after the above work, procedure <b>C</b> should be carried out <i>followed by procedure</i> <b>B</b>. Repeat this operation (procedure <b>C</b> <i>followed by procedure</i> <b>B</b>) 5000-6000 km after the initial work. By the way, to preserve the accuracy of a toggle-action torque wrench it is good practice to set the dial near the lower part of the torque range while it is in storage. Never apply additional force to such a wrench after the mechanism has toggled.<p>See the following section concerning higher torquing with "Victory" brand Montreal cylinder head gaskets and racing engines.<p>While the Montreal cylinder head studs have the same M12 x 1.5 mm thread as those of 1750 and 2000 cars, the head nuts are 17 mm instead of 19 mm because of the smaller wells.  Alfa Romeo special tool <a href="Montreal/A.5.0170photo.jpg">A.5.0170</a> allows the Montreal head nuts to be <a href="Montreal/A.5.0170.jpg">accessed easily</a>.  The 11 cm long special tool <a href="Montreal/S1061.jpg">No. 1061</a> made by <a href="http://www.stahlwille.de/">Stahlwille</a> of Wuppertal, Germany, is also suitable.

In 2011 <a href="mailto:inquiries (at) gasketstogo.com">John Baker</a> produced a <a href="Montreal/GtGgaskets2.jpg">new batch</a> of these gaskets using the same material, but which are silicone coated on the entire surface on both sides. The final 8 sets from this batch are available at a special discounted price of  USD 69.95 per pair plus USD 21.95 for registered airmail shipping.<p>A Montreal <a href="Montreal/VGasketPack2.jpg">engine gasket set</a> (Ref. 305930), initially developed under the "Victory" brand name by the Italian manufacturer Sivocci Est, can now be supplied by <a href="http://www.athena-spa.com/">Athena Spa</a>, Via delle Albere 13, I-36040 Alonte (Vicenza), Italy. This <a href="Montreal/VGasketSet2.jpg">comprehensive set</a> includes almost all the gaskets for the engine and exhaust system. Some of the sets had some unnecessary and some missing gaskets. The Sivocci Reference Nos. for the missing gaskets are <a href="Montreal/Gskt3310.jpg">3310</a> (the distributor drive flange/blanking plate gasket 105.64.05.102.00) and <a href="Montreal/Gskt3323.jpg">3323</a> (the upper timing chest gasket 105.55.01.305.01).<p>The cylinder head gaskets in the kit can also be purchased separately (Right head gasket, Ref. 330929; Left head gasket, Ref. 330930), but they are not of the highest quality. For owners who wish to fit superior quality cylinder head gaskets from another manufacturer, the engine gasket set less the cylinder head gaskets (Ref. 300930) can also be supplied. Seals are not included in the sets. Montreal owners can order any of the gasket sets directly from Athena from <a href="mailto:l.tregnago (at) athena-ad.com">Luisa Tregnago</a>  or <a href="mailto:sales (at) athena-ad.com">Daniela Zanellato</a>. <p>Some of the cylinder head gaskets have been manufactured without the copper sealing ring for the <a href="Montreal/GasketFault.jpg">hole by which the pressurized oil reaches the heads</a>. Athena will replace such defective gaskets free of charge.<p>See the preceeding section concerning cylinder head tightening.<p>Sivocci did not recommend the use of sealant with their Montreal cylinder head gaskets, which are already treated with a material that reacts to the heat of the engine. Avoid contamination of the gaskets or mating surfaces with oil and do not handle the gasket surfaces with bare fingers. Sivocci also indicated that the cylinder head nuts can be torqued 15-20% more than was prescribed by Alfa Romeo (i.e., to 9.3 - 9.8 mkg). Racing Montreal owner <a href="mailto:phil (at) hehir.co.nz">Philip Hehir</a> torques to 11.1 mkg following a gasket failure when using lower torque. At high torques there is a risk of pulling a stud from the block.<p>The OEM <a href="Montreal/HeadGaskets.jpg">cylinder head gaskets</a>, which were of higher quality than the "Victory" ones, were manufactured in Germany by <a href="http://www.elring.de/en/home.html">Elring</a> (Part Nos. 512.117 for the right side and 512.125 for the left side), but these are no longer available from the manufacturer. In early 2006, German Montreal fans <a href="mailto:HDN-AlfaMontreal (at) t-online.de">Dirk and Hannelore Nehme</a> arranged for the refabrication by Elring of a new batch of 80 gaskets. This version (Part Nos. 560130-02 for the right side and 560129-01 for the left side) uses silk-screened <a href="Montreal/Elring2.jpg">silicone beads</a> instead of copper rings for sealing.

The cylinder can be identified by examination of the spark plugs, since that from the affected cylinder will be cleaner than the others. A minor gasket leak may cause a continuous stream of bubbles in the coolant reservoir when the engine is running. However, such bubbles can also be caused by cracks in the cylinder heads, or by air in the coolant circuit if a malfunctioning filler cap valve prevents coolant returning from the reservoir to the engine after it has stopped.<p><a href="Montreal/A.2.0193a.jpg">Special tool A.2.0193</a> can be used to help remove the cylinder heads from the block, but this can still be a difficult task if <a href="Montreal/BlockCorrosion.jpg">significant corrosion</a> has occurred. Use penetrating oil liberally on the studs and ensure that the heads remain parallel to the block as they are raised. In difficult cases, an effective technique is to slacken the head nuts, remove the plugs and camshafts and stuff thick soft rope down the cylinders with pistons at BDC on their way to TDC (on the compression and exhaust strokes). Then rotate the crankshaft (by hand, or by pushing the car in gear, or even by blipping the starter if it is connected) to break the head free.<p>Note that the <a href="Montreal/DiffGasket.jpg">Montreal differential sump gasket</a> is longer than that for other 105 series cars.<p><a href="mailto:albfur (at) hotmail.com">Alberto Furegon</a> can supply <a href="Montreal/SpicaGasket.jpg">repro gaskets</a> for the joint between the Spica pump and the engine for EUR 3 each plus postage.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Compression"><h4>Compression testing</h4></a><p>The unmodified Montreal engine has a compression ratio of 9.0:1. Tests with a <a href="Montreal/CompTest.jpg">compression gauge</a> can be used to diagnose a number of engine problems caused by a defective head gasket, cracked cylinder head, burned valves or seats, sticking valves, or worn rings or cylinders.<p>To perform a compression test the engine should be run until working temperature is reached. Before starting, the battery should be well charged to allow consistent cranking throughout the test. All the spark plugs should be removed, the throttle blocked open and the fuel pumps and ignition units disabled by removing the two "Accensione, Pompa carburante" fuses. To reduce the injection of fuel, the CSS should be disabled and the Spica link rod disconnected.<p>The maximum compression figures for each of the eight cylinders should be recorded and compared. The actual values, typically 10 - 14 kg/cm2 (142 - 199 psi), depend on many factors such as engine temperature, cam timing and cranking speed and are of less importance than the difference between cylinders. The readings should be within 10-15% of each other.<p>Low compression on two adjacent cylinders may indicate a blown head gasket between them. A sticking valve could cause compression to be low for the first few turns before increasing to normal. If one cylinder has low compression, a wet test should be run by adding a little engine oil to it. If this raises the compression, worn piston rings or cylinders are indicated. If the oil has little effect, the head gasket or valves may be leaking.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Pistons"><h4>Pistons</h4></a><p>The Montreal engine uses 3-ring aluminium pistons with valve recesses in the crowns. During 1971 the pistons fitted to early engines were replaced by reinforced models (105.55.02.030.00 for pistons with Borgo rings, 105.55.02.030.01 for pistons with Goetze rings).  The reinforced pistons <a href="Montreal/Piston.GIF">carry the identification number 2926</a>, which distinguishes them from the early models (2773). <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> can supply a number of <a href="Montreal/PistonSet.jpg">NOS sets</a> of these pistons and rings.<p>Alfa Romeo recommended that the later models should be fitted if any pistons require replacement.  As there is a difference of weight between the early models and the later ones, the whole set of pistons must be replaced together to avoid balance problems. Piston clearance is 0.030 - 0.049 mm, from 10 mm below the top to 20 mm above the bottom of the liner.<p>The Montreal piston rings are the same as those used in the 1750 engine, the 1200 and 1300 engines of the Alfasud and the 1300 of the Alfa 33.<p><a href="Montreal/BottomEnd.jpg">Connecting rod</a> bearings (and <a href="Montreal/CrankBearings.jpg">main bearing shells</a>) for the Montreal engine can be supplied by <a href="http://www.afra.it/english/index.asp">Afra</a> and <a href="http://www.sergioallais.com/">Sergio Allais</a> in Italy.

(<a href="Montreal/LinerDrg.jpg">Higher resolution drawing</a> - 600 KBytes). They are machined from cast iron with <a href="http://home1.pacific.net.sg/~greglim/wtech/brinell.htm">Brinell hardness number</a> 220 - 270 and were classed in 3 tolerance ranges as follows: <ul><li> A (Blue) 80 -0.015 -0.006 mm<li> B (Red) 80 -0.005 +0.004 mm<li> C (Green) 80 +0.005 +0.014 mm</ul><p>The tolerance class is stamped on the top of liners which were supplied by Wizemann and marked on the outside lower wall of those from Borgo.<p>To avoid unseating a cylinder liner and breaking its delicate oil seal, ensure that the main crankshaft is not moved while a cylinder head is off the block. When the crankshaft has to be rotated, as to change pistons and connecting rods, <a href="Montreal/SlvRetain.jpg">sleeves and washers on the cylinder head studs</a> can be used to retain the liners instead of <a href="Montreal/A.2.0191.jpg">Special tool A.2.0191</a>. The acceptable projection of the liners above the block is 0 to 0.06 mm. <p>To extract a liner which is stuck in the block, run a bead of weld around the inside of it about a third of the way down from the top of the fitted portion. The liner will usually become free when the weld cools and shrinks.<p>The liner O-rings (105.41.01.102.00) are the same as used in 105-series 1750 engines.

Some owners have finished them in <a href="Montreal/CamCover.jpg">black</a>, <a href="Montreal/AdieV8.jpg">grey with black detailing</a>, or even <a href="Montreal/RedCams.jpg">red</a>. Autodelta often used a striking <a href="Montreal/ADcamCover.jpg">blue</a>. If powder coat is used for painting the cam covers a low-temperature version should be chosen to avoid warping of the castings during curing.<p>If the cam covers have been exposed to any acidic solvent it is likely to have eaten some way into the metal. If the corrosion is not too deep, bead-blasting should be able to clean the surface. Ensure that the blasting media have not been contaminated by cleaning previous oily parts and that the machined edges of the covers are fully protected. As the alloy contains magnesium it will re-oxidise quite rapidly after cleaning if no surface treatment is applied.<p><a href="Montreal/A.5.0180.jpg">Special tool A.5.0180</a> allows the cam cover nuts to be tightened conveniently with a 32 mm socket wrench. The Montreal parts catalogue shows the use of fibre washers (1306.12.08) in all 12 positions. In fact, aluminium washers (105.02.01.582.00) were fitted in the 4 rearmost positions to ensure electrical continuity between the cam covers and the cylinder heads.<p>When raising the engine, risk of damage to the cam covers can be avoided by employing a <a href="Montreal/Safelift.jpg">lifting hoist spread bar</a>.<p>In late 1972 Alfa Romeo issued a warning that when replacing the Montreal cam covers great care should be taken to centre them exactly on the cylinder heads. <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Tensioners"><h4>Chain tensioners</h4></a><p>The timing chain tensions should be checked at least every 10,000 km. The spring-loaded tensioners are locked in place by set screws that take a 14 mm wrench. The <a href="Montreal/LeftSetscrew.jpg">left side set screw</a> is located about the middle of the Spica, while the <a href="Montreal/RightSetscrew.jpg">right side one</a> is just above the alternator. <p>Before starting the adjustment procedure, drive the car to thoroughly heat the engine. Do not adjust the chain tension when the engine is cold, and do not overtension the chains as this may compromise the water pump bearing. To allow the tensioners to tighten the chains, slacken the tensioner set screws for a short time while the engine is running steadily at 1300-1500 rpm. Then tighten the set screws to lock them in place. While doing this operation keep clear of the fan, which might start running at any moment without warning. Be sure to slacken the set screws only while the engine is running at constant speed. On no account rev the engine during this operation, and don't start the engine with the set screws already slackened!<p>To allow the tensioner to move freely to set the chain tension, each set screw should be slackened at least one full turn so that the locking plate is not exerting any pressure on the shaft. But do not slacken the set screw so much that the locking plate could move out of position! (If the hole in the locking plate is not lined up with the tip of the set screw the tensioner may not be well secured when the screw is tightened).<p>If you feel nervous about this procedure, it is alternatively possible to turn over the engine by hand. The engine should still be hot before starting. Jack up the right rear wheel, slacken the tensioner set screws, and turn the wheel clockwise for a few revolutions while in top gear before retightening them.<p>Swiss Montreal specialist <a href="mailto:info (at) alfamontreal.ch">Sepp B&uuml;rgi</a> has described his recommended adjustment procedure in German, French and English <a href="http://alfamontreal.ch/wp/?page_id=291">here</a>.<p>Note that decreased cam timing chain tension may be an indication of a failing water pump bearing.

The synthetic rubber facings that are bonded to the timing chain guide castings tend to deteriorate with time and can eventually disintegrate.

Frendo FD 501 brake pads (105.64.22.052.01/25 front, 105.64.26.003.01/25 rear) were fitted to the Montreal initially, superseded in 1974 by FD 1004 HG pads (105.64.22.052.02/25 front, 105.64.26.003.02/25 rear). The later pads have white/yellow/white/yellow colour marks.<p>While the large ventilated disc brakes can take a lot of punishment without fading, they do require a relatively high pedal pressure in spite of the vacuum servo. Higher bite may be obtained by the use of pads having a high coefficient of friction, such as <a href="http://www.ferodo.co.uk/ferodo%5Fhome/">Ferodo DS3000</a>, but it should be noted that these are not E marked or approved for road use. Ferodo DS2000 pads are approved for road use but have a coefficient of friction 30% lower. <a href="mailto:agustivg (at) readysoft.es">Agusti Vilella</a> has reported good results with NECTO FD51A pads.<p>The braking efficiency can be significantly improved by replacing the front callipers with the 4-piston models which were made by ATE for some other vehicles. The callipers fitted to the Alfa 6 and to certain early BMW E23 7-series cars have the same bolt spacing.

The bolts must have precision shanks and very high shear strength. Brake pads of maximum thickness 15 mm should be used (e.g., asbestos-free Derendinger SB 33.11-60). Since the Alfa 6 callipers have twin hydraulic inputs, T-pieces (e.g., Derendinger 3.3513-0200.1) must be fitted in the brake lines and adequately secured.<p>These pictures were taken by <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a> during the fitting of Alfa 6 callipers to his Montreal:<ul><li> <a href="Montreal/Alfa6orig.jpg">The Alfa 6 callipers before adaptation</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Alfa6drilling.jpg">New M6 hole for securing T-piece</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Alfa6T.jpg">Hydraulic adapters with 10mm diam, 1mm pitch bushings</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Alfa6Ton.jpg">Calliper pair with T-pieces mounted</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Alfa6pipes.jpg">Calliper with complete hydraulic line</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Alfa6C1.jpg">Calliper mounted on Montreal</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Alfa6C2.jpg">Side view of mounted calliper</a></ul>The T-pieces and hydraulic brake lines were provided by an Italian manufacturer which supplies parts to Fiat.

One kit is required for the 4 pistons of each calliper.<p>Note that the ATE 13.4401-8019.2, 13.4401-8020.2 callipers fitted to some later BMW  E23 7-series models are not suitable for the Montreal as they are designed for 25 mm instead of 22 mm brake discs. (Since these callipers are wider they do not clear the wheels).<p>Suitable asbestos-free pads for the callipers are ICER 180304 or Siffert 2272 (Ferrari 365, 1969-73 etc) with ATE M4-13 (BMW 3411.1150.554) <a href="Montreal/AteM4-13.jpg">retaining clips</a>. The universal profile code for the pads is WVA 20437.<p>As the <a href="Montreal/MyCar14.jpg">BMW callipers</a> are about 1 mm off-centre, mounting spacers are required (int. diam. 12.5 mm, ext. diam. 25 mm). But no modification of the brake lines is necessary as they have a single hydraulic input, although they have twin bleed screws. These callipers bolt right in without any modification of the splash shield. <p>The replacement 4-cylinder callipers add somewhat to the unsprung weight: <ul><li> Original Montreal callipers: 4.80 kg<li> Alfa 6 4-piston callipers: 5.85 kg<li> BMW 4-piston callipers: 5.65 kg</ul>(Pads, clips and guide pins are included).<p>Brake squeal can be avoided by the application of high temperature grease such as Molyslip COPA-SLIP between pistons and pads.<p>In view of the small clearance between both the front and rear brake callipers and the wheels, it is not advisable to fit adhesive balance weights inside the wheels. The type of weights which clip on to the external edges of the wheel rims are to be preferred.<p><a href="http://www.alfaholics.com/">Alfaholics</a> offer a front brake kit for the Montreal including slotted discs with aluminium mounting bells and 4-pot callipers. The callipers require mounting adaptors, which are included in the kit along with a full bolt pack. The kit costs GBP 795, plus taxes where applicable.<p>High Performance Restorations of Nesscliffe, Shrewsbury, UK, Tel.

Since these callipers have a mounting hole spacing of 5.25in (133.4mm), they require <a href="Montreal/SSwilwoodRear.jpg">adaptors</a> to fit the Montreal. Universal adaptors (UNID .5) are available that can be machined to the required shape and drilled to suit the 3.5in (88.9mm) spacing of the Montreal.<p>The Montreal <a href="Montreal/RearCalips.jpg">rear brake callipers</a> are similar to those fitted to 1750 and 2000 Berlina, GTV and Spider Veloce models, except that they have an additional 10.5 mm spacer to accommodate the wider vented brake discs.  When <a href="Montreal/RearCalliper.jpg">replacing the callipers</a>, orient the pistons at an angle of about 20 deg to the reference surface of the callipers, with the higher end of the arc towards the front of the car. The bleed screws have 7 mm diam  x 1 mm pitch threads. The pad retaining kits for these callipers (ATE 13.0460-0125.2) are BMW Part No. 3421.1150.557.

To minimise this, a 7/8-inch ("22 mm") bore master cylinder (605.172.01, ATE 03.2122-0142.3) should be used rather than a 13/16-inch ("20 mm") one such as ATE 03.2120-4504.3. The 7/8-inch master cylinders were fitted to Montreals at the factory instead of the 13/16-inch ones from October 1973 onwards. Repair kits for both types of master cylinder are still available (105.48.45.020.03/30, 607.144.87, ATE 03.0370-1920.2, Seinsa D1123 for 13/16-inch, 105.64.45.020.00/30, 607.161.67, ATE 03.0370-4822.2, Seinsa D1093 for 7/8-inch).<p>To reduce pedal travel further, <a href="mailto:gtvoula (at) yahoo.com">Manos Protonotarios</a> has fitted a 15/16-inch (23.81 mm) master cylinder (ATE 03.2123-6802.3 or 03.2123-7002.3) from a 1970s BMW E12 5-series car to his Montreal. The two extra ports on this cylinder require to be plugged, but the original Montreal fluid reservoir can be fitted if larger rubber washers are used.<p><a href="mailto:marius (at) sorteberg.no">Marius Sorteberg</a> has fitted his Montreal with the 15/16-inch (23.81 mm) bore <a href="Montreal/BMW5MC.jpg">master cylinder</a> from an E28 528 BMW (model up to 1985). The BMW Part No. of this ATE master cylinder is 34311153053. As it has only two ports, a T-junction has to be fitted to the forward one to feed the separate hydraulic lines for the front callipers of the Montreal. The fluid reservoir from a BMW E30 320i can be fitted, as the original one is not suitable.<p>The Brazilian-made <a href="Montreal/VargaBrakeMC.jpg">Varga brake master cylinders</a> fitted to pre-1986 VW Golfs (VW Part No. 171 611 019D or 171 611 019N) can be used as replacements for the "20 mm" version of the more expensive ATE components.<p>The Montreal's dual brake system has separate hydraulic circuits for the front and rear brakes. Hence a single <a href="Montreal/BrakeRegl.jpg">proportioning valve</a> suffices to reduce the hydraulic pressure to the rear brakes, to improve the braking balance and prevent premature rear wheel lockup during hard braking. The valve is located just forward of the left side centre exhaust muffler. It requires no maintenance and does not require readjustment when the front callipers are upgraded.<p><a href="mailto:HDN-AlfaMontreal (at) T-Online.de">Dirk Nehme</a> has fitted his Montreal with the larger <a href="Montreal/MBservo.jpg">ATE 03.6850-0200.4 servo unit</a> which equipped Mercedes-Benz 230.6-280 CE (W114) (07.67 - 10.76). To accommodate the larger servo, Dirk extended the actuator of the clutch master cylinder to allow it to be <a href="Montreal/ClutchMC.jpg">mounted further forward on a new bracket</a>. The bracket was made by carefully cutting the original one from the old brake servo, turning it through 180 degrees and bolting it to the wheel arch with suitable reinforcing.  <p>With age, any of the three flexible hoses in the hydraulic brake piping can become partially obstructed internally. When this problem develops, the brakes may still be applied but the pistons may not retract the pads from the brake disks, resulting in excessive wear and overheating. Replacement hoses are readily available. <a href="Montreal/RearBrakeHose.jpg">Metal braided types</a> such as <a href="Montreal/GoodridgeHoses.jpg">Goodridge brakelines</a> have superior performance and longer life. The TAR0200-3P brakehose kit, although intended for the Alfa Spider, has been certified by Goodridge for the Montreal. It can be supplied by <a href="http://www.classicalfa.com/">Classic Alfa</a> for GBP 35, plus taxes where applicable.<p>The brake pedal cover is the same as that fitted to all other 105-series cars and replacements are readily available at low cost. <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Handbrake"><h4>Handbrake</h4></a><p>To maintain handbrake efficiency and correctly radiused brake shoes, the rotary adjusters inside the brake drums must be set before the cable length adjuster in the transmission tunnel. With a slack cable, the rotary adjusters should be used to lock the brakes and then backed off just sufficiently for the shoes to clear the drums. It can be helpful to remove the disc brake pads during this operation. The handbrake ratchet has a range of 5 clicks and the brake light switch should be adjusted to close at the 2nd click, while the brakes should be fully applied at the 3rd click. If the <a href="Montreal/HbrakeAdj.jpg">cylindrical cable length adjuster</a> is out of range, withdraw the cotter and remove the clevis pin from the handbrake linkage. The <a href="Montreal/HandbrakeLink.jpg">clevis</a> can then be rotated to set the cable length adjuster in the middle of its range.<p>The <a href="Montreal/HbrakeCable.jpg">handbrake cable</a> is routed over the rear axle housing. Some versions are fitted with metallic braid reinforcement in this area to prevent abrasion of the outer sheath. Replacement cables can be supplied by <a href="http://www.haeckner.com/">G. H&auml;ckner</a> for about EUR 33.<p>The <a href="Montreal/BrakeCables.jpg">side cables</a> are unequal in length and somewhat longer than those fitted to other 105 series cars, measuring about 57.5cm (left) and 55.5cm (right), hole-centre to hole-centre. The cables tend to stretch a little in service but as the main handbrake cable is adjustable their length is not extremely critical as long as it results in the relay levers being at a <a href="Montreal/BrakeRelays.jpg">reasonable angle</a>. Reproduction cables are available from suppliers such as <a href="http://www.ams-montreal-service.de/index.php/shop/bremsen/handbremsseile-hi-detail">AMS</a>.<p>In some cases, it can be difficult to separate the drums from the wheel hubs to change the brake shoes. With the wheel nuts on the studs for safety, retract the handbrake shoes completely and use a <a href="Montreal/DrumRemoval.jpg">gear puller</a> to apply moderate pressure to the brake disc while tapping the drum in a radial direction only with a rubber mallet. Do not try to separate the drum with the gear puller alone and do not strike the disc with the mallet! <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="ToolKit"><h4>Tool kit</h4></a><p>The tool kit supplied with the Montreal comprised only a wheel nut wrench, 19/21 mm spark plug box spanner, plain and Philips screwdrivers and a pair of pliers of mediocre quality. These items are contained in a black cloth pouch which is stored in the boot of the car. The handle of the wheel nut wrench is only 20 cm long but can be extended somewhat with the box spanner. The Part No. of the tool kit is 105.48.80.010.00, not 105.14.80.010.00 as shown in the TAV. 164 illustration. <a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a> produced <a href="Montreal/ToolKit.jpg">reproduction tool kits</a> that have the same content as the originals but the tools are of better quality.<p>Although some of the illustrations in the owner manuals show otherwise, the <a href="Montreal/MontiJack.jpg">jack</a> supplied with the Montreal (105.64.80.015.00) was of a different design from that supplied with other 105 series cars (105.00.80.015.01). The Montreal version has a large rake angle to clear the bulbous bodywork of the car and has telescopic tubes of square section, which prevents the inner tube rotating when the handle is turned with the foot off the ground. When not in use the jack is <a href="Montreal/JackMounting.jpg">secured by a wing nut</a> to a stud on the inside of the tail panel.

Some tools, such as dummy TAs of different lengths, are alternatives for the different versions of Spica injection pump which were fitted to the Montreal at different times. There were also a few special tools for the electrical equipment, the clutch and the propeller shaft.<p>Some examples of Montreal special tools include <a href="Montreal/A.5.0170p.jpg">A.5.0170</a> for accessing the cylinder head nuts, <a href="Montreal/A.5.0180.jpg">A.5.0180</a> for the cam cover nuts, <a href="Montreal/A.2.0169p.jpg">A.2.0169</a> for compressing the front springs, <a href="Montreal/A.2.0193.jpg">A.2.0193</a> for removing the cylinder heads and dummy TAs such as <a href="Montreal/A.4.0119.jpg">A.4.0119</a> (28.7 mm) for setting up the Spica injection pump. <p>The September 1977 edition of the <a href="Montreal/SpecToolsCat.jpg">Alfa Romeo Special Tools Catalog</a> (DIASS Publication No. 2561, 6000 printed) includes sketches of tools for the Montreal and other models.

A 40-page <a href="Montreal/BodyTools.jpg">Bodywork Supplement</a> to the Special Tools Catalog (DIASS Publication No. 2628, 6000 printed), published in April 1979, illustrates a few additional tools suitable for the Montreal.<p>At various dates numeric lists of Special Tools (without illustrations) were also published in several languages (e.g., <a href="Montreal/SpecToolsCatIt.jpg">DIASS No. 1669, November 1970, 2000 printed, for an Italian version</a>, DIASS No. 1678, May 1971, 1500 printed, for an English version; DIASS No. 2161, September 1973, 1500 printed, for a later version including the Alfetta and Alfasud; DIASS No. 2450 for an Italian version, October 1976, 2000 printed, DIASS No. 2549 for an even later Italian version, published in March 1977, including the F12 commercial vehicles).  <p>Reproductions of a few of the Alfa Romeo special tools for the Montreal can be supplied by <a href="http://www.totallyalfa.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.dspProductsByEngine&id=7">Totally Alfa</a>.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="ToolSets"><h4>Tool sets</h4></a><p>In 1974 Alfa Romeo offered 10 different special tool sets for the Montreal alone or in combination with other models. Each of the 10 sets was available at 3 different levels - A, B and C. The special tools required for major overhaul of the Montreal Spica injection pump were not included in any of the sets.<p>A-level sets comprised the basic tools required by Approved Workshops for ordinary service operations, while B-level sets were intended for all Dealers who might be required to carry out work on any of the mechanical components. C-level sets were recommended for Main Dealers since they included additional tools allowing some service operations to be carried out more rapidly. <p>The special tool sets were made available at very affordable prices. The simplest set (The A-level one for the Montreal alone), comprised 46 tools and in 1974 was sold for ITL 126,000. The most comprehensive (The C-level one for the Montreal, Giulia, 2000, F12 Benz., Alfetta and Alfasud) comprised 455 tools and cost ITL 1,595,000.<p>1973 Tool Bulletin 134/3 stated (my translation) "Tool Set A for the Montreal is optional for Approved Workshops because its use is dependent on the technical capabilities of the staff of these workshops and the number of cars of this type in the area".  <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="ToolBulls"><h4>Tool bulletins</h4></a><p>To complement the Special Tools catalogue, Alfa Romeo issued a number of Tool Bulletins (<a href="Montreal/ToolBulls.jpg">"Notiziari attrezzature"</a>) illustrating the use of some of the special tools to perform prescribed operations. A few of the Tool Bulletins issued between 1971 and late 1973 were relevant to the Montreal. The bulletins were numbered progressively and published in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. Some of the bulletins were revised 3 or 4 times during their lifetime.<p>Here is an example of the 2nd revision of the <a href="Montreal/ToolBull93.2.jpg">French version of Tool Bulletin 93</a>, issued in February 1973 in replacement of the revision of March 1969 (prior to Montreal production).

As mail order suppliers do not always distinguish between the variants it is wise to purchase emblems at classic car spare parts sales where they can be inspected and matched. The plastic insert type retaining glue tends to become brittle with age, allowing the insert to drop out.

But this material is relatively brittle and easily fractured by a minor frontal shock. As the alloy melts without warning at about 385 deg C, considerable skill is required to make a welding repair. With the appropriate flux Carr's solder can be used, but it is only half the strength of tin solder. The late Tony Pappas had the broken heart of his Montreal repaired by a specialist welder before polishing and replating.<p>A heart that is in good condition apart from the plating can be re-chromed. After removing the original coating, the metal should be copper plated and polished before applying the nickel and the chrome. Small surface imperfections can be covered by grinding down the area, or by plating with several layers of copper, polishing after each application. After the first copper plating, larger pits can be filled with low-temperature soft solder before polishing and applying further layers of copper.<p>A number of reproduction Montreal hearts have been produced at different times, but these did not all fit as well as the original. A run of 20 <a href="Montreal/ReproHeart.jpg">aluminium alloy hearts</a> was produced in Lucerne. These are very solid, accurately made castings, that are highly polished instead of being plated.

During renovation the material should be removed to check for rust, particularly in the area below the C-pillar ventilation slats. This tedious work can be facilitated by the use of an electric chisel with a 5 cm blade. Owing to its age, the material is hard and does not stick to tools. It can be replaced by modern <a href="http://www.dynamat.com/">Dynamat</a> or <a href="http://www.henkel.com/cps/rde/xchg/henkel_com/hs.xsl/12165_COE_HTML.htm">Teroson</a> products.<p>If the coachwork has been stripped, the sound-insulating material can alternatively be removed by dry ice blasting. In this process, pellets of solid carbon dioxide  at about -79 deg C are propelled against the surface by compressed air. The combination of thermal shock and kinetic energy breaks the bonding and the material is removed from the metal by the airstream. This technique can also be used for <a href="Montreal/DryIce.jpg">cleaning the underside of the body</a> in the case of a partial renovation with some of the major components still in place.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="AC"><h4>Air conditioner</h4></a><p>User instructions for the optional <a href="Montreal/ACinstns.pdf">air conditioning system</a> were given in supplementary leaflets published in early 1972 (Publication No. 1905, 5500 printed, for the Italian version; No. 1907, 2000 printed, for the English version; No. 1908, 3000 printed, for the German version). A 17-page "Air Conditioning System" manual (Publication No. 1969, 1000 printed in October 1972) gives general directions for checking and recharging the system which are applicable to the units fitted to the Montreal, 2000 and Alfetta. <p>Montreals that were fitted with an optional Borletti air conditioner have different climate control panels, and the blower fan has three speeds instead of two. Alfa suggested that to test the air conditioner the system should be run for about 10 minutes to allow all parts to reach operating temperature. The temperature of the air discharged by the evaporator outlets should then be about half the ambient temperature. However, this should only be considered a rough guide because the test does not take any account of the relative humidity of the ambient air. The latent heat transfer for water condensation on the evaporator would be expected to have a major influence on the capacity available for sensible cooling. A copy of the air conditioner parts catalogue can be dowloaded <a href="AirConCat.pdf">here</a>.<p>The combined heat and air conditioning system can be used to accelerate demisting provided that such blending is only used for a few minutes at a time. The blower fan is only used for recirculating cabin air and the lower control lever should not be pushed fully to the EST (outside air) position when the fan is operating. Note that the engine idle speed of a Montreal fitted with an air conditioner should be set with the compressor in operation.<p>Montreals equipped with the air conditioner have an <a href="Montreal/TAV.4.jpg">additional roller bearing</a> (105.55.02.154.00) for the crankshaft extension which drives the damper (alternator pulley) to which the compressor pulley is secured. To provide clearance for the compressor drive belts, the 105.55.07.304.00 pump tee was replaced by a modified design (105.64.07.304.00) having a flat at the front. The water pump body was also modified, possibly to receive the unequal length mounting studs of the new pump tee, which has a different flange thickness. <p>The <a href="Montreal/Compressor.jpg">original compressor</a>, although labelled 'Made in Italy', appears to be a single-cylinder Tecumseh HG500 model (Tecumseh mini, possibly manufactured by Blissfield) fitted with a Baruffaldi 154 mm electromagnetic clutch. This cast iron compressor weighs about 10 kg. To correct the ride height, front spring spacers of 7 mm greater thickness were used in Montreals fitted with air conditioners. The HG500 is no longer manufactured but gasket sets are available from <a href="http://www.compresores.com.mx/spanish/Qstore/p000057.htm">CyrSa</a>. <a href="http://www.classicautoair.com/">Classic Auto Air</a> in Tampa, Florida, <a href="Montreal/RebuiltComp.jpg">rebuilt</a> the compressor of <a href="mailto:alfagreene (at) yahoo.com">Delmas Greene</a> for about USD 600. <a href="mailto:marksonleave (at) hotmail.com">Mark Wallis</a> reports that a near equivalent is a <a href="http://www.ccicompressor.com/">CCI/York</a> Super-Compact ("Mini") Model SC206, a twin cylinder aluminium unit which is 2 kg lighter. The side plates require redrilling to fit it.<p>The original refrigerant was R12, which is now becoming expensive in some countries as it is only available by recuperation. When measured by the pressure gauges on a filling rig, the suction pressure should be in the range 0.8 - 2.5 kg/cm2 and the delivery pressure in the range 10 - 20 kg/cm2. For R12, 15 kg/cm2 saturation pressure corresponds to a temperature of 61 deg C at the output from the condenser. Note that the discharge pressure if R134a refrigerant is used may be 10-15% higher. Modern refrigerants like R134a may require seal changes and are somewhat less efficient. R134a seal kits are available for Tecumseh and York compressors. <a href="mailto:alfaron (at) yahoo.com">Ronald Johnston</a> offers a <a href="http://alfaron0.tripod.com/netauto/freon.html">replacement refrigerant</a> which is claimed to cool better than R134a and does not require component changes. <p>The 1975 Montreal of <a href="mailto:nashbap (at) yahoo.com">Nash Bapasola</a> is equipped with a relatively lightweight Harrison 365 rotary compressor. If replacing with R134a, Nash recommends charging to about 80% of recommended R12 capacity and using about 3 fl.oz. (90 cc) of Ester oil. <a href="mailto:vhtrein (at) hotmail.com">Victor Hugo Trein</a> has equipped his Montreal with a Nippon denso 10P08 compressor by making a new pulley for it and adapting the original support.<p>The 1972 Montreal of <a href="mailto:alfagene (at) att.net">Gene Brown</a> was fitted with an RD12 Sanden SD-505 compressor. The R134a equivalent of this model is the SD-5H09. Owing to their greater length, mechanical modifications are required to install even the smallest Sanden compressors in the Montreal. In the Montreal of <a href="mailto:keith.jolly (at) bigpond.com">Keith Jolly</a>, the problem of pulley alignment has been solved by fitting a single V-belt, using the rear sheave of the Sanden compressor pulley and the front sheave of the crankshaft one. Sanden International have published a <a href="http://www.sanden.com/support/RETRO.html">guide to the procedure for converting from R12 to R134a</a>. When using R134a with compressors that were initially designed for R12, they recommend charging to about 95% (by weight) of the R12 capacity and replacing the mineral oil by PAG oil rather than Ester oil.<p>The HG500 compressor has an oil capacity of about 8 fl.oz. (240 cc). The oil does not require to be changed regularly but the level should be topped up whenever the system is discharged. The oil must be completely changed when converting from R12 to R134a. Double end-capped PAG oil will blend with any mineral oil remaining in the system. <p>The receiver-drier should be replaced any time that the air conditioning circuit has been opened for service. <a href="mailto:BlackBart (at) aol.com">Bob Bartel </a>reports that the drier fitted to his wife's 1972 Montreal is AC Delco Part No. 12322478, which was used in many VW cars.

This appears to be a "universal" type equivalent to the Frigette 207-101.1 offered by <a href="http://www.airpartsonline.com">Airmec</a>. As XH5 desiccant is not compatible with R134a, the drier should be replaced by one containing XH7 or XH9 when changing to that refrigerant. After the air conditioning system has been discharged it should be vacuum evacuated for at least an hour to remove air and moisture before recharging.<p>Montreals fitted with air conditioners have a <a href="Montreal/ACpanel.jpg">different escutcheon plate</a> from that fitted to other cars (see <a href="#Escutcheon">Heater</a> section), on which a single double-headed horizontal arrow indicates the direction of movement of the upper control lever, which adjusts the heating, not the direction of the airflow.<p>A green and white <a href="Montreal/ACsticker.jpg">"Aria Condizionata" sticker</a> was applied inside the rear window of Montreals so equipped. <a href="Montreal/ACsticker2.jpg">Reproduction stickers</a> are available.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Chianti"><h4>Chianti clip</h4></a><p>Owners of Montreals without the optional air conditioner have discovered that the unused mounting bracket provided for the freon cleaner makes a <a href="Montreal/MyChianti.jpg">handy half-bottle holder</a>.

Most of the early cars were later retrofitted with spoilers through Alfa Romeo's after-sales service network and unused spare spoilers in original wrapping are occasionally found today. In addition to improving the front end adherence of the car at high speed, the spoiler improved the cooling airflow around the rear differential housing.<p>A <a href="Montreal/ReproSpoiler.jpg">reproduction front spoiler</a>, moulded in fibreglass by a tool from an original Montreal spoiler, can be supplied by <a href="mailto:Ldandtb (at) pacbell.net">Alfa Parts Exchange</a> for USD 125. <a href="mailto:mike_nakamura (at) msn.com">Mike Nakamura</a> reports that this spoiler was quite a <a href="Montreal/FittedSpoiler.jpg">good fit on his Montreal</a>, although the <a href="Montreal/DrillGuide.jpg">drill guide nub</a> positions did not all line up perfectly with the fixing holes on his vehicle.<p><a href="mailto:g.penatti (at) gmail.com">Giorgio Penatti</a> can supply a fibreglass reproduction front spoiler which is composed of <a href="Montreal/GP4spoiler.jpg">four separate sections</a>.

A silicone product should be used to ensure a watertight seal with the bonnet to prevent corrosion of the injection pump which is <a href="Montreal/Nacat.jpg">located immediately behind it</a>. I suggest drilling out the single embedded 4 mm fixing screw at the front of the duct and replacing it by a stainless steel stud.<p>Although no air can pass through the <a href="Montreal/OrigNACA.jpg">simulated grille</a> of the original duct, Montreal owners have been known to modify this component by <a href="Montreal/OpenNACA.jpg">removing the metal</a> between the 6 vertical struts.<p>NACA, by the way, the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/stories/2005/032505_NACA_90th.html">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</a>, was active from 1915 to 1958.

This excellent miniature, <a href="Montreal/NewTogiBox.jpg">boxed</a> with a presentation stand and cover, was available in red only through Alfa Romeo dealers as an "accessory" (Part No. 60708423).  Although it can no longer be centrally supplied, some Alfa Romeo parts distributors may still have stock as it was still catalogued up till 1997. Versions of the model in orange with <a href="Montreal/OrangeTogi.jpg">beige</a> or <a href="Montreal/ElfTogi.jpg">black</a> interiors can be found at model markets, while kit versions in <a href="Montreal/TogiKit2.jpg">orange</a> and <a href="Montreal/TogiKit.jpg">black</a> were also made. The kits were sold in a very fine <a href="Montreal/TogiBox.jpg">box</a>.

But the wheel styling and bonnet opening geometry are inaccurate and the headlamp shelters are too large and coloured black. The Togi model has better dimensional accuracy at the front and rear of the car, and more realistic wheels which steer, but the spare wheel is wrongly positioned and it lacks engine compartment and under-chassis detail.  The bonnet profiling behind the NACA duct (which needs to be finished black in both cases) is too curved on the Polistil/Politoys model and too straight on the Togi one.<ul><li> Otaki produced a <a href="Montreal/OtakiBuilt.jpg">1/24 scale plastic model</a> of the Expo '67 prototype Montreal in kit form in 1971.

At these intermediate stages no particular attempt was made to use the bulkheads in exact numerical sequence and the <a href="Montreal/MontiBodies.jpg">stocking arrangements</a> were not strictly first-in-first-out.<p>As a result, although LHD Montreals carry Chassis Nos. in the range AR1425101 to AR1428862, while RHD cars are in the range AR1440101 to AR1440326, the sequence of Chassis Nos. differs from the order of manufacture of the vehicles.  For example, Montreal AR1428832 was officially made in December 1976 while AR1428837 (5 numbers later) was made in March 1975. Both cars were originally shipped to Germany and are now owned by <a href="mailto:thoroddt (at) online.no">Thorodd Thoroddsson</a> in Norway. As an extreme example, AR1425245 was made in 1971 whereas AR1425244 was made in 1977! Two Montreals carry the Chassis No. AR1425101, one of which is exhibited in the Alfa Romeo Museum.<p>Having reviewed previously published lists and personally researched Alfa Romeo records at the Centro di Documentazione Storica at Arese, Bernhard Schalbetter compiled a new database of Montreal Chassis Nos. Permission was granted by Alfa Romeo (<a href="Montreal/ElviraRuocco.jpg">Elvira Ruocco</a>) to publish the information on this website, and the <a href="Montreal/ChassisNos14May2020.pdf">current version (May 2020) of the database</a> with corrections by Federico De Franceschi is available in PDF format. Note that within each year the Chassis Nos. are listed in ascending numerical order. As explained above, this does not indicate the order in which the vehicles were manufactured!<p>The Montreal data given in Luigi Fusi's <a href="Montreal/Fusi.jpg">"All Alfa Romeo Cars from 1910"</a> (3rd edition published in 1978 by Emmeti Grafica s.a.s., Milan) are quite superficial.1971: Chassis Nos. 10564.1425101 to 10564.1425668, Engine Nos. 00564.00001 to 00564.00668.1972: Chassis Nos. 10564.1425669 to 10564.1428045, Engine Nos. 00564.00669 to 00564.03045.(No data are given for later years). Nevertheless Fusi's estimate of a total of 3925 Montreals manufactured has been widely copied by the motoring press and is now stated on the FCA Heritage website.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Records"><h4>Records</h4></a><p>The <a href="mailto:heritage@fcagroup.com">FCA Heritage Service</a> can provide a <a href="https://www.fcaheritage.com/en-uk/classic-services/alfa-romeo-certificate-origin">Certificate of Origin</a> for an Alfa Romeo Montreal on submission of its Chassis No.They can normally indicate:<ul><li> Original body and interior colours<li> Date of manufacture<li> Date of sale by Alfa Romeo<li> First purchaser (owner's name and city for cars sold to customers in Italy, otherwise normally the Alfa Romeo importer for his country)<li> Engine No.</ul>Then use this <a href="http://www.copleys.com/calendar/">calendar</a> to see on what day of the week your car was built.<p>They can also inspect a Montreal at the <a href="https://www.museoalfaromeo.com/en-us/Pages/MuseoStoricoAlfaRomeo.aspx">Museo Storico Alfa Romeo</a> in Arese and issue a <a href="https://www.fcaheritage.com/en-uk/classic-services/alfa-romeo-certification-authenticity">Certificate of Authenticity</a> that guarantees its originality.<p>The date of manufacture may reveal that your Montreal is much older than you thought!  Some late-1972 cars sat in <a href="Montreal/Stock1.jpg">unfinished</a> and <a href="Montreal/Stock2.jpg">finished</a> factory stock and showrooms for over a year before finding buyers who were not too intimidated by the oil crisis. Most cars sold in 1976 and 1977 may have been built before the end of 1975 using body shells manufactured before July 1974 - see <a href="#End">End of the line</a>. <p>Jaeger components, such as the main instruments and the steering column switch, are individually stamped with their date of manufacture. A date may also be stamped on the insides of the fusebox covers. These component data do <b>not</b> indicate the date of manufacture of the vehicle, but they do set an earliest limit to the date of its assembly.<p>In the UK, cars manufactured before 1 January 1973 are exempt from vehicle excise duty. From 1 April 2014, the cut-off date will be changed to 1 January 1974. Cars manufactured prior to 1 February 1975, or that were first registered before 1 August 1975, do not require full emissions testing, just a visual exhaust check.<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Production"><h4>Production</h4></a><p>Between 1971 and 1977 more than 3900 Montreals were manufactured, comprising about 3733 LHD (105.64) and 180 RHD (105.65) versions.  Although a RHD prototype was shown at Earls Court in October 1971, it has been <a href="Montreal/Winwood.html">reported by Robert Winwood</a> that the production RHD cars were assembled in a single run at the Iso plant in Modena during 1972. However, Alfa Romeo records show that they were manufactured from 1973 and they did not begin to enter the UK until May 1974. About 9 or 10 <a href="Montreal/RHDconversion.jpg">RHD conversions</a> (with 00564 LHD engines having the distributor on the right) are believed to have been made in 1971-72 by Thomson &amp; Taylor, Bell &amp; Colvill in West Horsley, Surrey, and Mario Dellioti in Birmingham. Original RHD Montreals have <a href="Montreal/RHDinsts.jpg">instruments</a> with labels in English instead of Italian, deg F instead of deg C, and speedometer figures in both mph and km/h. <a href="mailto:paulb (at) highway1.com.au">Paul Blank</a> reports that a LHD Montreal which was imported to Australia was dismantled for conversion to RHD when fairly new and is still awaiting reassembly!<p>The number of Montreals manufactured is not known precisely, but the production figures per year for LHD cars are believed to have been approximately:<ul><li> 1971 - 674<li> 1972 - 2348<li> 1973 - 316 . . . (Year of the oil crisis)<li> 1974 - 78<li> 1975 - 273<li> 1976 - 17<li> 1977 - 27</ul> <p>    A total of 155 Montreals were sold in Britain and 480 in France.  <a href="mailto:peter.schweiss (at) ifp.fzk.de">Peter Schweiss</a> reports that the central register of the Federal Motor Transport Authority (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt) in Flensburg shows that 135 Montreals are registered in Germany today (including temporarily unregistered cars). Alfa Romeo Australia imported about 100 Montreals between February 1974 and December 1975 and well over 30 of them are believed to have survived today (plus at least 3 private imports). <a href="mailto:laurent (at) demycars.lu">Laurent Schandeler</a> reports that there are currently 12 Montreals in Luxembourg plus 4 parts cars. There are at least 7 Montreals (plus a parts car) in Norway, over 10 in South Africa, 3 in Argentina, 3 in Hungary and 6 or 7 (one of which is dismantled) in New Zealand. <a href="mailto:josepachecoalves (at) hotmail.com">Jos&eacute; Pacheco Alves</a> reports that at least 9 of 17 Montreals that came to Portugal have survived. <a href="mailto:jaatinen (at) aref.fi">Timo Jaatinen</a> reports that one Montreal was imported to Finland when new and there are at present 7 in the country. One Montreal was imported to Iceland when new and there are now 2 in that country. Piotr Nag&oacute;rski in Pozna&#324; owns the only Montreal in Poland. <a href="mailto:g.solomonides (at) solomonides.eu">Georgios Solomonides</a> is restoring the only Montreal that was sold directly by Alfa Romeo to Cyprus. From late 1972 onwards, 10 Montreals were imported to Japan and at least 7 are still in the country, including 2 in Saitama. In 2023, one was re-exported to the USA. Two Montreals were imported to Iran, but neither is in running condition today.<p>The Montreal was never officially marketed in the USA and the Montreals which found their way Stateside were personal imports. A report in Hemmings Sports &amp; Exotic Car for November 2006 that there are only 14 Montreals in the US is entirely false. A US Montreal Register that was maintained by the late Ken Shaff listed 76 Montreal owners in March 1990 and this website includes actual photos of over 30 US Montreals. <a href="mailto:DCZaitz (at) aol.com">Doug Zaitz</a> reports that 25 year old vehicles are now exempt from compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and 21 year old vehicles from EPA (emissions) requirements. US vehicle importation regulations are published by the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/">NHTSA</a>. The EPA has a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/otaq/ld-hwy.htm">website</a> and a Faxback Information system on vehicle importation at 202-564-9660. Document #101 is an index of the faxes available and #115 appears to be the one which Montreal importers should review. However, emission testing requirements for classic cars vary from state to state (exemption in California 30 years after first registration, 25 years in some other states).<p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Modifications"><h4>Modifications</h4></a><p>So few Montreals were built after the oil crisis and European speed restrictions struck that it was somewhat neglected by Alfa Romeo and relatively few significant factory changes were made to the 1970 vehicle design:<ul><li> Front <a href="#Spoiler">spoiler</a> added after the first 100 vehicles. As this had significant impacts on performance most early cars were retrofitted through the after-sales network.<li> Height adjustment rack for the headrests introduced in the first year of production.<li> Reinforced <a href="#Pistons">pistons</a> fitted in 1971.<li> <a href="Montreal/RearTrim.jpg">Trim flanking rear registration plate</a> simplified from late 1971.<li> "Milano" removed from the <a href="Montreal/Badge.jpg">Alfa Romeo emblem</a> after the opening of the Pomigliano d'Arco Alfasud factory in 1972.<li> Modifications to the <a href="#Accel">accelerator linkage</a> in late 1972 (from Chassis No. AR1427428, with exceptions).<li> Modifications to the <a href="#Suspension">front suspension</a> from Chassis No. 1428312 onwards.<li> From late 1972 engines with <a href="#Emission">improved emission characteristics</a>, distinguished by the letter 'S' in the Engine No., were fitted to Montreals for certain markets. By May 1973 they were being fitted to all vehicles.<li> New connecting rods, brake servo, master cylinder, floor stamping and other structural bodywork changes (not affecting the external appearance) in the autumn of 1973.<li> Minor changes, mainly affecting internal trim, made to the last vehicles to be made (see next section).</ul><p>Some of the very first production Montreals had minor differences in items like the NACA duct, quarter window winders and chrome trim at the base of the windscreen pillars. Some vehicles had additional <a href="Montreal/DecoSlats.jpg">decorative trim</a> surrounding the headlamp shelters. During production other small design changes were made to details such as the <a href="#Filters">fuel filters</a>, the <a href="#Airbox">idling air equalizers</a> and the central console (reinforcement bracket for cigarette lighter, changes to gear lever gaiter mounting and trim). The water pump tee was modified to allow the addition of an <a href="#AC">air conditioner</a>. In addition, in order to meet different national regulations, there were variations in the lighting and turn indicator arrangements of models shipped to different countries. <p>Some countries impose very few restrictions on the modification of classic cars by their owners, whereas in others (such as Switzerland) alterations from the original manufacturer's specifications are strictly regulated. In the UK, MoT testing laws will be changed from 20 May 2018, so that Montreals (and other vehicles that were first registered over 40 years ago) will no longer need an annual MoT test unless they have been 'substantially modified' in the last 30 years.<p>'Substantial modifications' include changes to the technical characteristics of the chassis, running gear, suspension, steering or engine. But there are many exceptions, including changes that are made to preserve the vehicle when original type parts are no longer reasonably available, and changes to the axles and running gear that improve efficiency, safety or environmental performance. The Government guidelines are available <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/670431/vehicles-of-historical-interest-substantial-change-guidance.pdf">here</a>.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="End"><h4>End of the line</h4></a> <p>It has been reported by <a href="Montreal/Book.jpg">Luigi Giuliani</a> that production of the Montreal effectively ceased in 1975 and the cars sold in 1976 and 1977 were actually manufactured earlier. Gian Beppe Panicco of Bertone has stated (in December 1990) that Montreal body production ended in July 1974.<p>A report by the Italian car magazine "Automotor Magazine" (Issue 89, February 1997, page 123) that the last Montreals may have been assembled under contract by Iso Rivolta has been denied by both Alfa Romeo and Carrozzeria Bertone.  According to research by Maurizio Bedina, an Iso Rivolta minority shareholder called Paolo Curti and partners claim that they bought some of the remaining materials and moved them to Rome where they continued to assemble a small number of clone vehicles until they ran out of essential parts.  Paolo Curti claims to have shipped the last such car to a Swiss customer in 1994.<p>Some different internal trim items, such as vent window control knobs, wooden instead of metal door kick panels, and ashtrays without the Montreal logo, were fitted to the last Montreals to be manufactured.  Other changes which I have seen on late models include a larger diameter brake booster. To provide clearance for this, the clutch master cylinder was positioned further forwards, and a special <a href="Montreal/Reservoir.jpg">angled headlamp shelter vacuum reservoir</a> was fitted to accommodate it. Some cars have the angled vacuum reservoir but the original size of brake booster and clutch master cylinder.<p>Some late Montreals have a  <a href="Montreal/NarrowSeat.jpg">narrower rear seat squab</a> than earlier cars, which permits the front seats to be moved further back to accommodate a tall driver and passenger. To permit this, the <a href="Montreal/StandardSS.jpg">normal seat support member</a> was replaced by an <a href="Montreal/AngledSS.jpg">angled one</a>.  The length of the bucket section is reduced from 25 cm in the <a href="Montreal/WideSeat.jpg">standard seat</a> to 20 cm in the <a href="Montreal/NarrowSeat2.jpg">narrower one</a>. According to the Dutch SCARB records of <a href="mailto:Mertens-AR-Montreal (at) ziggo.nl">Wil Mertens</a>, this change was made in late 1975 and affected about the last 100 Montreals to be manufactured. <p> <a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Prices"><h4>Prices</h4></a><p>The Alfa Romeo list price for the Montreal was ITL 5,200,000 in 1971, rising to ITL 6,779,100 at the end of 1973, to ITL 9,570,000 at the beginning of 1975 and ITL 11,505,000 at the end of that year.  In the UK it was launched at GBP 5077, rising to GBP 5549 in August 1972 (metallic paint GBP 129 extra) and to GBP 6999 by mid-1976. In France the Montreal was priced at FRF 60,000 in 1973. (Sport-Auto claims that this sum was equivalent to FRF 270,000 in 1998). In Germany the basic Montreal was offered at DEM 35,000 in 1975, with supplements of DEM 750 for metallic paint, DEM 2400 for the air conditioner, DEM 660 for electric windows and DEM 167 for the front spoiler. These prices were maintained in 1976 and a genuine leather interior was offered for an additional DEM 1580. In Australia the starting price for a RHD Montreal in 1974 was AUD 14,400 (metallic paint AUD 193, air conditioner AUD 574), rising to AUD 17,490 for the last one sold.<p>In Switzerland the vehicle was listed at CHF 39,500 in 1971-73 and CHF 39,700 in 1974-75.  (The Montreal was no longer officially catalogued here in 1976-77). The following factory options were offered:<ul><li> Metallic paint:  CHF 1000<li> Air conditioner:  CHF 2000<li> Electric windows:  CHF 800<li> Spoiler:  CHF 150 (This was really a non-optional option)</ul>Today USD 1 = CHF 0.95, but in 1972 the <a href="Montreal/CHFUSD.GIF">exchange rate</a> was USD 1 = CHF 3.92, making the basic vehicle about USD 10,077. After the 1970 Geneva Salon it had been expected that the Montreal would be available in the USA for about USD 9000, but this was not to be. <p>Since the publication by Veloce of <a href="WhichBook2.jpg">two books</a> about the Alfa Romeo Montreal, the car has become more widely understood and appreciated. In the US, the average price of very good cars at auction has risen from USD 30,250 in 2007 to USD 80,000 in 2023.<p>In November 2006, Bonhams &amp; Goodman auctioned a low-mileage 1974 Montreal in Sydney for AUD 36,000. In 1999 a California buyer paid USD 35,000 for a fine example (AR1426457) that was shipped to France. In May 2009, the car was resold at auction in Monaco by <a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/17302/lot/220/">Bonhams</a> for EUR 35,650 and shipped back to the US.<p>In August 2007, orange 1972 Montreal AR1426462 was sold for USD 30,250 by <a href="https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/mo07/monterey-sports---classic-car-auction/lots/r223-1972-alfa-romeo-montreal-coupe/481190">RM Sotheby's</a> at the Monterey Sports and Classic Car Auction.

Even high resolution photos can fail to reveal defects that are visible to the naked eye, and a road test should be part of every evaluation. Be very wary of purchasing a cheap car that requires major restoration work. In the end, this may require much greater expenditure than the extra cost for a Montreal that is in good condition. In addition, some Montreal advertisements on eBay are scams. That is, the advertiser does not possess the car being auctioned, but has made up a fake advertisement using photos of a Montreal belonging to someone else.<p>Here are some links to websites that usually list some Montreals for sale:<ul><li> <a href="http://www.ooyyo.com">OOYYP network - select your <b>country</b> and <b>Alfa Montreal</b></a><li> <a href="http://suchen.mobile.de/fahrzeuge/search.html?isSearchRequest=true&sortOption.sortBy=searchNetGrossPrice&sortOption.sortOrder=ASCENDING&lang=en&scopeId=C&_features=on&bodyStyleRadio=on&makeModelVariant1.makeId=900&makeModelVariant1.modelId=&makeModelVariant1.modelDescription=montreal&makeModelVariant2.makeId=&makeModelVariant2.modelDescription=&makeModelVariant3.makeId=&makeModelVariant3.modelDescription=&minFirstRegistrationDate=&maxFirstRegistrationDate=&minMileage=&maxMileage=&minPowerAsArray=&minPowerAsArray=KW&maxPowerAsArray=&maxPowerAsArray=KW&minPrice=&maxPrice=&export=ALSO_EXPORT&fuel=&transmission=&damageUnrepaired=ALSO_DAMAGE_UNREPAIRED&ambitCountry=&zipcode=&climatisation=&numSeats=&doorCount=&emissionClass=&emissionsSticker=&adLimitation=&daysAfterCreation=&usageType=&usedCarSeals=">Mobile.de in Germany</a><li><a href="http://www.autoscout24.ch/fr/voitures/alfa-romeo--montreal?make=2&model=1982&nav=7&vehtyp=10"> AutoScout24 in Switzerland</a><li> <a href="http://www.classiccar24.ch/go/Voitures;0">ClassicCar24 in Switzerland</a><li> <a href="http://voiture.trovit.fr/voitures-occasion/alfa-romeo-montreal">Trovit in France</a><li> <a href="http://www.anciennes.net/lecture.php?c=201&page=0&cl=pri&rec=alfa%20montreal">Anciennes.net in France</a><li> <a href="http://www.lacentrale.fr/occasion-voiture-modele-alfa%20romeo-montreal.html">LaCentrale in France</a><li> <a href="http://www.lva-auto.fr/petites-annonces.php?idType=-1&idMarque=MA238&idModele=MO1440&idCarrosserie=-1&idDepartement=-1&idVae=AR110&rechercheType=1&newrecherche=1&vue=liste">LVA-auto in France</a><li> <a href="http://www.gaspedaal.nl/Alfa-Romeo/Montreal/">GasPedaal in the Netherlands</a><li> <a href="http://bringatrailer.com/?s=alfa+montreal&x=8&y=8">Bring a Trailer in the US</a><li> <a href="http://www.hemmings.com/classifieds/?adtypeFacet=Vehicles+for+Sale&makeFacet=Alfa+Romeo&modelFacet%5B%5D=Montreal&range_zip=&distance=&price_min=&price_max=&year_min=&year_max=&categoryFacet=&q=">Hemmings classified ads in the US</a><li> <a href="http://autos.aol.com/used-list/make1-Alfa+Romeo/model1-Montreal">AOL Autos in the US</a><li> <a href="http://www.carandclassic.co.uk/classic_cars.php?keyword=Montreal&make=1&category=&region=&country=&advert_type=&price=&era=&Search.x=47&Search.y=15">Car and Classic in the UK</a><li> <a href="https://www.classiccarsforsale.co.uk/keywords-alfa+montreal">ClassicCarsForSale in the UK</a><li> <a href="http://www.ukvehicle.com/cars-for-sale/alfa-romeo/montreal-8554/">UKvehicle.com</a><li> <a href="http://topclassiccarsforsale.com">Top Classic Cars For Sale (international)</a><li> <a href="http://www.vast.com/cars/make-Alfa+Romeo/body-Coupe">Vast Used Cars (international)</a><li> <a href="http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/alfa-romeo/montreal">Octane (international)</a><li> <a href="http://www.carsales.com.au/all-cars/results.aspx?Ns=pCar_RankSort_Int32%7c1%7c%7cpCar_PriceSort_Decimal%7c1%7c%7cpCar_Make_String%7c0%7c%7cpCar_Model_String%7c0&N=1247%201282%201252%201246%204294967249%201216%204294967153&SearchAction=N&Qpb=true&sid=123FC121EB07&Nne=20">Car Sales in Australia</a><li> <a href="http://digiads.com.au/used-ALFA%20ROMEO-for-sale/ALFA%20ROMEO-carsales.html">DigiAds in Australia</a></ul>Montreals have also been sold at auction.

The test vehicle had chassis No. 1425101. <p>The French authorities in Paris homologated the Montreal on 28 June 1971 (<a href="Montreal/DescriptifP1.jpg">Page 1</a>, 255 Kbytes; <a href="Montreal/DescriptifP2.jpg">Page 2</a>, 275 Kbytes). The prototype vehicle presented for examination was chassis No. 1425102, at the time fitted with engine No. 2604.<p>With a view to competition participation, the standard 2593 cc Montreal was <a href="Montreal/FIA3044.jpg">homologated by the CSAI</a> in FIA Group 3 (GT series) on 1 April 1972, after the required minimum production of 1000 cars was reached in January of that year. An extension to include the normal front spoiler was added on 1 May.<p>At the same time <a href="Montreal/Group4Monti.jpg">Group 4 (GT special)</a> variants of the vehicle were homologated with some bodywork (wheel flare) and rear suspension changes and a few Autodelta clutch and engine modifications. Heavier connecting rods (105.59.02.020.01) were installed, the counterweights of the crankshaft (105.55.02.100.056 AD) were altered, the flywheel was lightened from 8.4 kg to 5.8 kg, and the <a href="Montreal/SlideBlock.jpg">sliding block system</a> of the Giulia GTA was adapted to locate the rear axle.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="3litre"><h4>3-litre engine</h4></a><p>Subsequently Autodelta made a small number of higher performance hybrid engines comprising a combination of 33 and Montreal parts. The 3-litre (2997 cc) variant of the standard 2593 cc engine had a single-plane steel crank. A <a href="Montreal/LondonShow.jpg">3-litre Group 4 racing Montreal</a> shown by Autodelta at the International Racing Car Show in London in January 1973 was claimed to develop 370 bhp at 9000 rpm. Following the event, the car was <a href="Montreal/G4showroom.jpg">exhibited</a> for some time in the Edgware Road showroom of Alfa Romeo's UK subsidiary. A <a href="Montreal/RGM04.jpg">1/43 model of this car</a> by Reiner G&ouml;tzke (RGM Design) was produced by BBR.<p>In 1973,  Montreals were entered for the world championship 5th round at Spa (No. 44, Dino Pizzinato) and the 7th round at N&uuml;rburgring (<a href="Montreal/Gleich73.jpg">No. 64</a>, Dieter Gleich and Dieter Weizinger for Alfa Romeo Deutschland) but Pizzinato failed to qualify and Gleich failed to finish. At this time the car was still painted <a href="Montreal/G4Gleich.jpg">green</a> but had a raised black bonnet area above the engine. In February 2006, a <a href="Montreal/64metro.jpg">1/43 model of this car</a> which was manufactured in China for <a href="http://www.metro.mo.it/">Metro Sales Promotion</a> was sold in Italy with issue No. 14 of the "<a href="Montreal/14model.jpg">Alfa Romeo Sport Collection</a>" supplement to La Gazzetta dello Sport, published by <a href="http://edicolafabbri.corriere.it">Fabbri Editori</a>. Repainted in <a href="Montreal/Stahlberg.jpg">white livery</a>, Gleich's car was later raced with Nos. 18 and 360 by Hans Stahlberg, an Alfa Romeo dealer in Hamburg who had done much to promote the Montreal in Germany.<p>In 2004 the car (<a href="Montreal/Grp4ChassisNo.jpg">Chassis No.</a> AR*1425230*, <a href="Montreal/Grp4EngineNo.jpg">Engine No.</a> AR00564*01459*) was discovered in storage in Germany and purchased by <a href="http://www.haenggi-bauleitung.ch/portfolio/garage-salvadori-lausen/">Ivo Salvadori</a>, who runs a repair shop for Italian cars in Lausen, Switzerland. At that time the car was painted <a href="Montreal/G4Salvadori.jpg">orange</a>, but Ivo has now restored it to its original "London Show" condition and it was <a href="http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/images/gallery/techno2015/44701.jpg">exhibited</a> by <a href="http://www.lukashuniag.ch/index.html">Lukas H&uuml;ni</a> at the 2015 Techno Classica in Essen, Germany. <p>In 2014 a Montreal was meticulously rebuilt as a Group 4 racer and improved with great attention to detail by <a href="mailto:dha.schumann (at) t-online.de">Dirk Schumann</a> of <a href="http://www.lucky-racing.de/">Lucky Racing</a>. It participated in a number of classic races such as the Historic Dutch Grand Prix Zandvoort carrying the No. 46.<p>The Bobcor 3-litre racing Montreal is described in the next section.<p>Two modified Alfetta GTV shells were equipped with 3-litre Montreal engines and a 340 bhp marine version of this engine was also developed (see later sections).  Unfortunately the premature dismantling of the engine production line at Alfa Romeo thwarted plans by Autodelta to have 400 3-litre Montreal engines produced for a series of Alfetta GT 3000s (to permit Group 4 homologation of this vehicle).<p>The <a href="Montreal/MontiBlock.jpg">97 mm centre spacing of the outer cylinder pairs</a> is sufficient to allow the standard Montreal block to be bored out to accept 92 mm liners for 86 mm dia pistons. Several Montreal owners including <a href="mailto:maurizio (at) bedina.it">Maurizio Bedina</a>, <a href="mailto:cimagesinc (at) aol.com">Allan Kramer</a> and <a href="mailto:Wheelerxjr (at) aol.com">John Wheeler</a> have successfully bored out the standard engine to 2838 - 2998 cc. John has provided a <a href="Montreal/JohnWheelerNote.pdf">summary of the details of his 3-litre engine conversion</a> and the resulting dyno data, which shows 227 ft lbs torque at 5500 rpm and 290 bhp at 8000 rpm. He attributes the performance improvement in part to the introduction of a fully mapped electronic management system for fuel injection and ignition. Note that this engine has now been sold.<p>The <a href="Montreal/MalEngine.jpg">3-litre Montreal engine</a> of Mal Nicholson (<a href="http://www.trentsideclassics.co.uk">Trentside Classic & Sportscars</a>) develops about 240 bhp. The <a href="Montreal/MalCar.jpg">bonnet of the car has been modified</a> to clear the carburettors and more direct <a href="Montreal/MalExhaust.jpg">side exhaust pipes</a> have been fitted. Mal participated in the "Italian days" event at the historical Zandvoort circuit in June 2003.

Robert (Bob) Cozza</a>, who bought his first Alfa in 1961 while an engineer with Lockheed Aircraft, resigned his position as a corporate vice-president to open a small car dealership and chose sports car racing as a showcase for his new venture. As the business expanded and racing successes accumulated, Bob negotiated Alfa Romeo sponsorship for a racing Montreal to be built by Autodelta. In 1973, the 3-litre <a href="Montreal/BobcorFlier.jpg">Bobcor Racing Montreal</a> was entered for the 10th round of the International Makes' Championship at Watkins Glen (<a href="Montreal/BobcorWG73.jpg">No. 25</a>, <a href="Montreal/BertEverett.jpg">Bert Everett</a> and Teodoro Zeccoli) but failed to finish due to gearbox failure. The car was extensively modified and in 1974 took part in several races and finished 27th in the 6 hour IMSA Championship round at <a href="Montreal/Bobcor25.jpg">Road Atlanta</a>. It again participated at <a href="Montreal/BobcorWG74.jpg">Watkins Glen</a> but on this occasion engine failure occurred after 6 laps. After <a href="Montreal/PaulNichter.jpg">Paul Nichter</a> was classed 35th and 41st but failed to finish in both rounds at Laguna Seca, the Montreal adventure into international-level racing was terminated when Autodelta support was withdrawn.<p>Before he died in March 2010, Bob Cozza provided <a href="Montreal/Bobcor.html">an account of the Bobcor Racing Montreal story</a>. He summarized: "The car was super fast....we blew by Corvettes, Porsches, Mustangs, etc, in the straights but it couldn't stop or corner as it should and the Type 33 engine or ZF box would always fail after two hours or so".<p>In 1978, the Bobcor Racing Montreal was leased for one year to Jose Guttirez in Venezuela and returned as a wreck. While Bobcor were starting to rebuild it, the car was bought by Luis Cattenna, a gentleman with a private race track in El Salvador, and shipped there in pieces. It was then raced for two years as a Club Sport but caught fire in a hillclimb event in Mexico. The car was later owned by the late Jerry Galich and is now <a href="Montreal/Galich.jpg">undergoing restoration</a> by his son <a href="mailto:xanny9 (at) aol.com">Victor Galich</a> in Huntington Beach, California. By the winter of 2005 it was planned to have it ready for racing by a few well-known drivers from the period. A sister car is also being constructed. This will have a relocated engine and modern drive train and was to have been ready in the spring of 2007. <p><a href="Montreal/RGM06.jpg">Models</a> of the Bobcor Racing Montreal have been produced by RGM Design and M4 s.a.s. <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Hybrid"><h4>Hybrid engine</h4></a><p>In early 2001 <a href="mailto:Wheelerxjr (at) aol.com">John Wheeler</a> acquired one of the <a href="Montreal/Hybrid.jpg">Autodelta engines</a> (#0226) which had been in store for over 25 years, totally immersed in Castrol R and with almost zero miles.<p>This engine is fitted with a single-plane steel <a href="Montreal/ADcrank.jpg">crankshaft</a> instead of the normal Montreal cross-plane one. The stroke is 64.4 mm but the engine has been bored out to 86 mm (92 mm dia liners). The compression ratio is 11.25:1. The connecting rods are standard Montreal and the <a href="Montreal/ADpistons.jpg">pistons</a> 86 mm forged slipper section. The inlet throttles are the slide type of the Daytona 33/2.<p>John has made a <a href="Montreal/JohnWheelerNote2.pdf">detailed list</a> of the differences between this engine and the normal Montreal one. He has obtained dyno data of 251 ft lbs torque at 6000 rpm and 336 bhp at 8500 rpm. The engine is now performing well in a historic Cooper-Alfa Formula 1 car.<p>In 2008, a <a href="Montreal/Autodelta2.jpg">similar engine</a> was acquired by Dutch Montreal owner <a href="mailto:ADuiven (at) flowserve.com">Arnoud Duiven</a>, who has <a href="Montreal/MOV00005.3gp">fitted it in his Montreal</a>. At present the air horns are not mounted, so that the original bonnet fits, and a modified air filter is fitted on the throttle bodies. Arnoud is designing a new intake system to optimise the performance.<p>In 2005, <a href="mailto:alfaward (at) bellsouth.net">Ward Witkowski</a> purchased a <a href="Montreal/WWviewS.jpg">special Montreal</a> equipped with a similar Autodelta engine from the estate of the late John Murphy. (See Ward's Personal story in the "Montreal owners" section for details). Unlike the racing Montreals, only the large <a href="Montreal/WWfrontS.jpg">NACA duct</a> reveals that the car does not have the standard engine. <a href="Montreal/WWengineS.jpg">The Autodelta engine</a> has Spica injection, but with the rack controlled by an external mechanism, and at present has butterfly throttles instead of the sliding plate system. The RIAR have indicated that only three Montreals of this type were built. Ward is at present restoring the car to its original condition.<p>Another <a href="Montreal/AreseAD.jpg">Autodelta Montreal engine</a> is in storage at the <a href="http://www.alfaromeo.com/com/#/history/museum/">Alfa Romeo Museum</a> in Arese.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="GTV"><h4>Montreal GTV</h4></a><p>In 1975 Carlo Chiti's team at Autodelta fitted a <a href="Montreal/V8GTV.jpg">version of the 3-litre 340 bhp Montreal marine engine</a> to two special <a href="Montreal/GTV8shell.jpg">light-alloy Alfetta GTV shells</a>.  Described at the time as an Alfetta GT3000, this <a href="Montreal/GTV8factory.jpg">hybrid car</a> has been referred to as a GTV8 after the appearance of the GTV6. One of these cars was entered in the rally of Elecar, Piacenza, Italy, in December 1975 but failed to finish due to failure of the gearbox (in spite of its having been strengthened). After further improvements were made for the 1976 session, the car had a few racing successes before the project was abandoned to save costs and the two drivers Jean Claude Andruet and Ballestrieri left the team.<p>One of these cars was located near Milan and <a href="Montreal/GTV8Holland.jpg">fully restored by Bob van der Sluis in Holland</a>. It has been described by <a href="http://www.alfaromeochallenge.com/joshugense.html">Jos Hugense</a> in the Dutch Alfa Romeo Club publication "Het Klaverblaadje", No. 73, 1996. Ed McDonough's impressions on driving the car at the 1997 SCARB meeting at the Assen circuit are recorded in "Assen Alfas", Auto Italia, No. 19, March 1998. The car is now owned by Sauerbier Beheer Inc. It is believed that the second car was sold to Japan in 1990. <p>In 1977, on the initiative of Horst Reiff, Alfa Romeo's German distributor in Aachen, a very small number of GTVs were equipped  with the Montreal's normal 200 bhp engine. These GTV shells were the regular steel ones and only the bulge on the bonnet betrayed that they were fitted with the V8 engine. This powerful coup&eacute; was marketed in Germany as the <a href="Montreal/V8alfetta2.jpg">Alfetta GTV 2.6i V8</a> for DEM 50,000.  0-100 km/h acceleration for the hybrid vehicle remained as for the Montreal, but the maximum speed was claimed to exceed 230 km/h. <p>A fine original Alfetta GTV 2.6i V8 is maintained by <a href="mailto:stefan (at) schmoelzl.de">Stefan Schm&ouml;lzl</a> in Bavaria, South Germany.

Volker had bought the car in 1980, and during the following years he drove it regularly during the summer months. In 1988 he bought a Montreal, which he restored. Since the future availability of spare parts was uncertain, he started to acquire additional mechanical parts for the car, and in the late 1990s he acquired two Montreals in pieces. He then had the idea to install one of the Montreal engines in his Spider, since he loved the sound and considered it one of the best V8 engines ever made.<p>In his "first life" Volker had worked as a car mechanic in a small but fine garage, mostly on Alfa Romeo cars, and he planned to make the completed car look just as if it had been manufactured by Alfa Romeo. For good handling, and because there was little clearance under the Spider bonnet, the engine had to be positioned as low as possible and near to the centre of mass of the car, so that the Montreal steering box and column had to be used. In addition to the engine, with Weber IDF 40 carburretors, he transferred the water and oil radiators, the gearbox, propshaft, rear axle and front disc brakes to the Spider.<p>Volker started the project in October 2002, and the work took about 250 hours. In addition to solving many smaller problems, the main steps were:<ul><li> Overhauling the engine and the rear axle using Spider driveshafts<li> Moving the battery to the boot<li> Adapting the engine mounts<li> Fitting a special oil tank under the right fender<li> Welding work to enlarge the engine bay, especially the sides and the front for the Montreal water and oil radiators<li> Modifying the steering, including the column shroud, bracket and steering rods<li> Adapting the gearbox and gear lever in order to avoid modifying the Spider's centre console<li> Modifying the propshaft<li> Adapting the Montreal exhaust system</ul><p>After several tests the suspension setting is now satisfactory, the car handles well and it accelerates rapidly.

To comply with the Racers 2500 category, the displacement of the 2593 cc Montreal engine was diminished to 2466 cc by reducing the bore from 80 mm to 78 mm. Apart from the new Autodelta pistons and liners (AD.105.55.02.031.026), the principal modifications concerned the engine supports, the exhaust manifolds (AD.105.55.01.072.008) and output couplers and the oil/coolant heat exchanger (AD.105.55.31.045.019). Autodelta produced a <a href="Montreal/Marino1.jpg">descriptive brochure</a> for the "Motore Marino Alfa Romeo Montreal". <p><a href="Montreal/ADmarine.jpg">This engine</a>, which weighed 190 kg, developed <a href="Montreal/Marino2.jpg">190 bhp in standard form</a> and 260 bhp in a tuned version.  In December 1971, Franco Giliberti's <a href="Montreal/Gilberti.jpg">Montreal-powered speedboat</a> carried off 3 world records in this class at Sarnico on Lake Garda. In 1973 other Montreal-powered racers such as Celli and Popoli were victorious at Lignano Sabbiadoro and Cremona, while a Montreal-powered speedboat  built for Leopoldo Casanova of Colorno (Parma) by Lucini-Frigerio in Como won the R4 2500 class world championship at Sabaudia. Casanova raced with this engine until 1977, when Autodelta replaced it by a 3000 cc version that developed 320 bhp at 8200 rpm.<p>After a long period in storage, this boat (without its engine, which had been returned to Autodelta) was bought by Guido Romani in Milan. In 2007, Guido was able to acquire an original Autodelta 3000 cc engine for it, complete with Spica and 33-style slide throttles, which he exchanged for <a href="Montreal/GuidoEngine.jpg">4 dual Weber 40 carburettors</a>. The boat has now been <a href="Montreal/Guido31.jpg">fully restored</a> and is one of the fastest vessels to participate in <a href="Montreal/Sacca2012.jpg">historic racing events</a>. It has also been <a href="Montreal/Monza2013.jpg">exhibited</a> at major automobile shows, such as the Autodelta 50th Anniversary event at Monza in September 2013.<p>One Popoli speedboat is exhibited outside the basement floor of the <a href="http://www.alfaromeo.com/com/#/history/museum/the-opening">Alfa Romeo Museum</a>, Arese, Italy.  With a 2465 cc 78 x 64.4 mm Montreal engine tuned to 315 bhp at 8800 rpm, Leopoldo Casanova achieved a world record speed of 225 km/h with this speedboat on the Lake of Sabaudia. This boat was made specially to break the world record, and was never raced in circuits. Another Popoli speedboat, made in 1972 for Antonio Dosi of Vigevano, was originally fitted with a 6-cylinder Alfa Romeo 2500 engine but was later upgraded with a <a href="Montreal/PopoliEngine.jpg">Spica-injected Autodelta hybrid Montreal V8</a>. Dosi raced this boat successfully for 5 years, achieving a 200 km/h run at Sabaudia in 1979. <a href="Montreal/Popoli.jpg">This boat</a>, which has special alloy cladding on the bodywork and a forward pilot position, is currently being restored by Guido Romani.<p>Offshore boats equipped with twin Montreal engines competed successfully in the OP2 class (limit 8200 cc) and in September 1973 Caprara and Scalabrin's speedboat <a href="Montreal/UFO66.jpg">UFO 66</a> established a new European record in this category at Alassio.<p>Several different versions of the Montreal marine engine were produced, including a 260 bhp version of the normal 2593 cc one. A marine version of the 3-litre Montreal engine with a compression ratio of 11:1 developed up to 340 bhp, while an Autodelta adaptation of a 4-litre version of the 33/3 engine raised the power to 500 bhp for a weight of 180 kg.  The all-Italian offshore powerboat Dart, which was equipped with <a href="Montreal/DualMarine.jpg">two such engines</a>, was capable of speeds of about 150 km/h. <p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Tasman"><h4>Tasman engine</h4></a><p>Another 2500 cc version of Autodelta's 33/2 V8 engine was developed to meet the "Formula Tasman" specification. These engines were run in various open-wheeler (formula) cars such as the Mildren Alfa (Australia) which competed successfully in the "Tasman series" of races in Australia and New Zealand. The success of these 2500 cc engines was a factor in the decision to equip the Montreal with an enlarged version of the 33/2 engine.  Autodelta's <a href="Montreal/Tasman.jpg">"Relazione Prova Motore"</a> sheet for this Spica-injected V8 "2500 Montreal" engine indicates that it developed 262.5 bhp at 8400 rpm, falling to 245.5 bhp at 9000 rpm.<p>In March 1968 an Alfa Romeo "2500 Tasmania" engine was offered by Autodelta to Don Black of ARI, New Jersey, for ITL 6,000,000 (USD 10,125 landed USA). One such engine was sold to Leon Greff for use in his tube-frame (GTV shell) drag car.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Competition"><h4>Contemporary competition</h4></a><p>Specially-prepared Montreals have also participated in contemporary competition events on road and track. In 2001 <a href="mailto:phil (at) hehir.co.nz">Philip Hehir</a> commenced racing a <a href="Montreal/Philip1.jpg">lime-green Montreal</a> prepared by Alfa racer Chris Snowdon. The rebuilt car had its first trials on English circuits and is now in New Zealand for the summer racing season there and in Australia. It has been extensively modified for competition work and a sturdy roll cage has been welded into the frame. The car has been lightened, the brakes, suspension and drivetrain have been modified and the Spica system has been replaced by an OMEX controlled electronic fuel injection system.<p><ul><li> <a href="Montreal/Philip7.jpg">Out in front</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Philip2.jpg">The cockpit</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Philip4.jpg">Interior view</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Philip5.jpg">The engine bay</a><li> <a href="Montreal/Philip6.jpg">Trackside clutch change</a></ul><p><a href="Montreal/Start2000.jpg">Richard Anderson's car</a> has regularly taken part in the Classic Adelaide rally in Australia.

Average speeds on the Classic Adelaide are extremely high and the Montreal is almost unbeatable on the fastest stages. Hence the car regularly beats specially prepared Porsches and BDA Escorts with special equipment such as the best gearboxes.<p>French drivers <a href="mailto:vichy (at) wanadoo.fr">Stanislas Macho&iuml;r</a> and his wife Clair Macho&iuml;r De Buffon have recently had notable successes with their <a href="Montreal/TourDeEspana.jpg">Group 4 racing Montreal</a>. In the 3rd Tour de Espana in November 2001 Macho&iuml;r and co-driver Jaquinot were placed 9th in the competition section, ahead of 7 Ferraris, and gained 3rd prize in the post-1965 category. 18 cars out of 82 starters failed to finish this tough 5-day trial over 10 hill climbs and 3 circuits. The car was also well placed in the 2001 and 2002 Tours Auto and the 2002 and 2004 Tours d'Italia, performing in these events without any mechanical problems. <p>In 2002 a <a href="Montreal/238.jpg">racing Montreal</a> driven by Thomas H&auml;fner participated in several <a href="http://www.sac.onlinehome.de/">Scuderia Alfa Classico</a> events including that at the <a href="http://www.eurospeedway.de/">Lausitz EuroSpeedway</a> in Germany on 21-23 June. Thomas was victorious in his class at the <a href="http://www.motopark.de/">Oschersleben Motopark</a> event on 26-28 July 2002 with an average speed of 124.68 km/h. Montreals have also participated in the annual classic events at the <a href="http://www.hockenheimring.de/">Hockenheim ring</a> and <a href="http://www.nuerburgring.de/">N&uuml;rburgring</a> in Germany and the <a href="http://www.circuit-zandvoort.nl/">Circuit Park at Zandvoort</a> in the Netherlands.<p>Since 2005, the Montreal of Ralph Ortiz has achieved many racing successes in South Australia, winning several overall championships as well as the under 3-litre class in his state. Ralph's car, possibly the only black Montreal in Australia, has a carbon fibre bonnet and has been lightened to 1000 kg. It has 1200 lb springs at the front and a lowered rear end, with a front suspension camber kit and a Watt's linkage at the rear. It is fitted with 8J x 15" <a href="http://www.centerlinewheels.com/">Center Line</a> Convo Pro wheels, which weigh only 5.5 kg each, and has upgraded front brake callipers and discs. Except for a Motec EFI system, custom extractors and a racing exhaust, the engine is standard and develops 197 bhp. Ralph is currently collecting the components to build a full race engine.<p>In 2003, at the age of 85, Australian Montreal owner <a href="Montreal/Charges.jpg">Neal Charge and his son Chris</a> decided to enter their pristine car in the Targa Tasmania with minimum modifications. In that first rally the Charge's Montreal was placed 3rd in its class. It went on to gain 1st place in its class and category in 2004, and 2nd in 2005, securing them a Gold Plate trophy. Neal and Chris also participated in the Classic Adelaide in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and were class and category winners in 2004. They also competed in the 2005 Mount Buller Sprint (2nd in class) as well as historic demonstrations during the 2005 Australian Grand Prix and 2007 Phillip Island events. The team again entered for the Targa Tasmania in 2008, when Neal won another class victory at 90 years of age, and <a href="Montreal/CNC2009.jpg">in 2009</a>, securing them a Platinum Plate trophy.<p><a href="#top">(top)</a><p><hr><p><a name="Matta"><h4>Montreal jeep</h4></a><p>In the 1980s the Italian owner of a 1954 Alfa Romeo 1900M (AR51) military 4x4 utility vehicle replaced the original 65 bhp engine with the 200 bhp Montreal power plant. This unique <a href="Montreal/LaMatta.jpg">"Montreal jeep"</a> is now owned by Jeremy Upsall in the UK, who reports that it makes collecting spares for his business more interesting! The forward-hinging bonnet, like that of the Jaguar E-Type, gives splendid access to the V8 engine.
