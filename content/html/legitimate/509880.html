The premise was simple,  deliver accurate, compiled information about the events industry. It was a revolutionary tool for event professionals  such as event vendors, suppliers and service providers. It was over 800 pages of previously unavailable information that grew  into a new industry and it was produced by Events Media for over 10 years.</p><p>The explosion of the Internet as the source of "instant" information was just beginning. After the early years of the printed version, the Special Events Directory evolved into an online presence under the name www.eventcrazy.com. In 1998, eventcrazy.com exploded onto the  Internet "event" landscape. We took our existing data and created a simple, revolutionary and easy to navigate search  system developed and created by our inhouse team. It was a breakthrough technology that could help people in the events industry such  as vendors, suppliers and venues. But it also was the #1 source for just anyone looking for places to go and things to do all over the  United States and Canada.</p><p>Along with our own site, Events Media, the parent company of eventcrazy.com began licensing our information to the major online players; Lycos, Google, The Weather Channel, Microsoft, Hilton Hotels, Accuweather, Synacor and many, many more.  All of the movers and shakers at the infancy of the Internet were people that used the EventCrazy feed in their online sites.</p><p>Many things have happened in the evolution and changing landscape of the Internet. We are proud of what we have  accomplished and of what we meant to the launch of the Internet for commercial purposes.  We delivered a remarkable product for years and we were one of the firsts of the firsts. Our legacy speaks for itself. Our trailblazing ideas helped, in some small way, to change the event landscape by delivering instant results for people  looking for something to do "NOW".</p><p>So now the time has come for us to have our own personal "events". It is time for all of us to reap the benefits of our hard work of the last 34 years.  We sincerely thank all of our users as we announce our retirement. We are proud of what we began and of all the  wonderful event experiences we navigated our users to visit for their enjoyment. So few professions and websites can claim  that they have been responsible for creating fabulous memories and memorable experiences to last a lifetime.</p><p>Thank you to all of our friends, we wish you health and happiness and a continued life of event experiences!</p><p>Maria, Marshall, Brad, Jen, Doug and the entire EventCrazy team.</p><p>EventCrazy and it's .com domain names are for sale.
