<p><b>The first definite record we have of our Orton ancestry is William
Orton of Wilnecote, parish of Tamworth, Staffordshire, England. Wilnecote
is a chapelry of Tamworth, a parish that was formerly partly in Warwickshire
and partly in Staffordshire, and since 1988 the whole of the parish, including
Wilnecote, has been transferred to Staffordshire. William was age 21 according
to his marriage record, 26 May 1845, placing his birth at about 1824. His
marriage record also states he was the son of John Orton. He is perhaps
the William Orton baptised 8 Feb 1824 parish of Mancetter, Warwickshire,
England son of John and Ann Orton. John and Ann Orton resided in Oldbury,
a hamlet within the parish of Mancetter where he was a brick maker and
laborer. Family tradition states that the name was originally Horton, but
because there were so many Hortons the "H" was dropped and our family adopted
the name Orton. John and Ann Orton appear in records as both Orton and
Horton. Besides our ancestor William Orton, John and Ann had baptised at
Mancetter the following: Charles Orton baptised 5 May 1822, Ann baptised
17 Sept 1826, Arthur baptised 9 Aug 1829, and Bartholomew born Hartshill,
baptised 5 Aug 1832. Further research is in the process of determining
this families relationship and the identity of our William Orton.</b>
<p><b>On the 1841 census of Wrapper&#8217;s Hole, hamlet of Stockingford, parish
of Nuneaton was enumerated:</b>
<p><b>John Orton, 56, brick maker</b>
<p><b>Henry, 19, labourer,</b>
<p><b>Charles, 17, brick maker</b>
<p><b>William, 15, coal miner</b>
<p><b>Arthur, 11, ribbon weaver ap</b>
<p><b>Bartholomew, 8</b>
<p><b>William Orton married 26 May 1845 at the parish church, parish of
Foleshill, Warwickshire, Hannah Payne b. July 1826 baptised 12 Nov 1826
parish of Ansley, Warwickshire, England, daughter of Charles Payne and
Sarah Moore. William was a coalminer and she was a weaver at the time of
their marriage, both residing at Longford, which is located in the parish
of Foleshill, near Coventry. Both signed by mark (an X versus a signature).
As above stated William was age 21 and Hannah was age 20 on the marriage
record, though Hannah was actually age 18. The family was living on Randles
End, parish of Exhall, Warwickshire in the 1851 census enumeration. An
Ann Orton, widow, age 56, born Bulkington, Warwickshire was close by and
residing on Randles End, but whether this is William&#8217;s mother cannot at
this time be ascertained. Ann&#8217;s birth at Bulkington might mean that she
is one and the same person as Ann Atkins who married a John Orton in 16
Apr 1822.</b>
<p><b>Census records for the family for 1851, 1861, 1871, 1881, and 1891

of senile gangrene of left foot (death record). If she was born in July
1826 her actual age was 73. The informant was Ellen Wiggall, granddaughter.
It would appear William was living at her decease. He was enumerated at
126 Hockley Road, Wilnecote, Tamworth, Warwickshire, England, widower,
age 74, "not able to work." There is no cemetery at Wilnecote and perhaps
their interment may be at Tamworth.</b>
