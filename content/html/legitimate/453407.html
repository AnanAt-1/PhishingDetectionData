Trigger also made significant contributions to theory and debates on epistemological&nbsp;issues within archaeology.  The 2003 book "Artifacts and Ideas" is a collection of previously published papers that trace the history and development of these contributions.<br />
<br />
In particular was his arguments about how the social and political contexts of research effect archaeological interpretation.  One  essay entitled "Archaeology and the Image of the American Indian" documents how archaeological interpretation reflected and legitimated stereotypes&nbsp;of Native American peoples and expressed the dominant political&nbsp;ideas and interests of Euro-American culture.  For example, prior to 1914 Euro-American&nbsp;stereotypes resulted in a prehistory that saw native cultures as being primitive and inherently static.  It was commonly believed that Native Americans had not undergone any significant developmental changes and that they were incapable of change.  It was believed that natives had arrived in the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("77123",this,"americas.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("77123")' href="/topics/Americas">Americas</a><span class="hp" id="m77123"><div class="hpHeader">Americas</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i77123"></div>The Americas, or America , are lands in the Western hemisphere, also known as the  New World.
