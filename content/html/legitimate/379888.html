									<p><strong>Absecon &#8211; Pitney House &#8211;</strong> Late at night, as the only visitors when staying in a private cottage of this B&amp;B, a soft song could be heard playing on a fife (a flute like instrument).  No one else was on this property that night, not even the owner or caretaker.</p>

It is said that if you drive down there late at night, and you enter into a patch of fog on the road, it will follow you and you will find footprints on your car&#8230;human footprints.<br />
<strong><br />
Allamuchy &#8211; Ghost Lake &#8211;</strong> Ghost Lake is located on Shades of Death Road in Allamuchy Township the local legends vary &#8211; but the prevailing theme is that there was an Indian Graveyard there and settlers built a man made lake over the graveyard. At night the Indians haunt the area &#8211; even we (locals) stay away. Plus there are MANY bear families there so be careful.</p>

While it was being built, the wife went up to the top floor, as she came down, she saw her husband with another woman! She ran back up to the top, and jumped out. There is a myth, if you circle the tower, 8 times or something, something is supposed to happen. Nobody has been able to complete it.</p>

Bay Head &#8211; The Greenville Hotel/Restaurant &#8211;</strong> Over the years many employees have experienced many things from ghosts physically appearing (looking very much like a live person) and walking down the hall and disappearing, to the sounds of children playing in the lobby late at night. One employee even reported falling asleep on the couch in the lobby and awaking to the sounds of kids playing in front of them. He saw glimpses of them as well. There are sounds of moving furniture in unoccupied rooms, sounds of people walking down the hall but &#8220;no one is there&#8221;, the sense that someone is standing behind you, but &#8220;no one is there&#8221;. Guests report hearing children run down the halls laughing in the middle of the night, but there are never any live children doing that. In fact it is rare that children stay there.</p>
<p><strong>Bayonne &#8211; Bayonne High School &#8211; </strong>The now auditorium of the high school used to be the Jr high section. It&#8217;s been said that a boy around 14 hung himself from the stairwell, also it&#8217;s been said he was pushed and broke his neck but anyway. If you go there just before school season begins you will see a boy opening the doors to the auditorium with school books in his hands. Also on many nights that the high school has put on plays there is a boy in the back of the room just watching.</p>

Never to be seen again but forever heard!</p>
<p><strong>Bayonne &#8211; Robbins Reef Yacht Club &#8211;</strong> The gentleman who haunts this location was said to have hung himself in an unstairs bedroom. If you enter the room in the dark, a cold icy feeling passes over your skin. In addition, bottles have been seen &#8220;jumping&#8221; off the ledges in the back of the bar, not breaking, and if replaced on the ledge, will again leave the spot to land on the floor.</p>

At the end of the field there is a huge hideous looking tree with a branch that extends perfectly parallel to the ground. It is said that the tree was used to hang slaves on and still has a chilling aura to it. You can see marks on the trunk from people attempting to chop it down, they say whoever tries, something bad happens to and sometimes a pickup truck will try to chase you out. In the Summer that tree is in full bloom and actually quite lovely. In the Winter or Fall however, it is creepy looking. The axe marks on the tree are from years of kids hearing the legend of the tree and what would happen if you tried to cut it down. Supposedly if you try to cut it down the devil in a black pick up truck will come and chase you away, once you drive down the road a bit the truck just vanishes. It&#8217;s an Urban Legend that gets featured in Weird NJ magazine all the time. Please get permission before you visit this property, otherwise you are trespassing and could get arrested.</p>
<p><strong>Blackwood &#8211; Jefferson Hall at Camden County College &#8211;</strong> This structure used to be a monastery before becoming a learning institution. It is said that a residing monk hanged himself on the third floor of this building. Security guards of the college have reported hearing footsteps thumping down the hall of the third floor. They often avoid interior patrol.</p>
<p><strong>Boonton &#8211; Darress Theater &#8211; </strong>It was closed for many years and was finally bought and used for children&#8217;s theater (like Snow White, etc.) and they also show movies there at night, too. The people that are there late at night say they hear voices, footsteps and the chair seats move. There have also been reports of singing coming from the theater when everyone has gone home for the night.</p>

When it was discovered by Washington&#8217;s troops that Champlain was a spy they did not let on to him that he was compromised. At the start of the battle it was relayed to the troops by Washington himself that Champlain should be shot from behind to let the British know that his traitorous dealings didn&#8217;t deserve a bullet from the firing squad. Upon the start of the Battle Champlain moved to the front of the line to get a better shot he was heard to say, and before the first volley of shots were exchanged between side&#8217;s he was dropped in his stride from a volley of shot&#8217;s from five patriot&#8217;s. It has long been said that the spirit of William Champlain Haunt&#8217;s the sub-division in search of Washington in the hopes of finding out why he was struck down by his own troops. Being only a boy of 17 at the time of his demise and fond of the flute he has been heard many a fall night playing sad ballads and tunes in search of his mentor. So if you are walking or driving down Shelly Drive one evening and see a young lad dressed in Colonial attire don&#8217;t be alarmed it is only William Champlain looking for his troops bivouac, and the reason for his betrayal.</p>

									<p><strong>Alamogordo &#8211; cemetery and canyon road &#8211;</strong> many people and especially the older residents of Alamogordo have claimed to have seen a woman dressed in white in the cemetery late at night and also along and up canyon road as far as the scenic extension floating, and always at night.

Double Eagle restaurant and Peppers grill are both in the same building.</p>
<p><strong>Montezuma &#8211; Montezuma Castle &#8211; </strong>60 miles east of Santa Fe, The Evil was filmed there. Ever since, people have seen some sort of woman in the castle towers at night. No one wants to go in there at night. It is currently being renovated.</p>
<p><strong>Pendaries &#8211; Restaurant &amp; Lodge &#8211; </strong>Many of the employees have seen an older man in the downstairs bar. He has also been seen outside one of the rooms in the lodge.</p>
<p><strong>Philmont &#8211; the haunted mesa &#8211;</strong> paranormal activities and sightings of apparitions have appeared over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Pojoaqus &#8211; Pojoaque High school &#8211; </strong>A girl hung herself in the girls locker room at the gym from a showerhead. She is now said to wander around the gym and if you go into the locker room at night you will see her body hanging from the shower.</p>
<p><strong>Raton &#8211; The Shuler Theatre &#8211; </strong>Located in the center of town, the theatre is most certainly haunted. On stage there are scraping sounds of someone in high heels. Down in the dressing rooms is the scariest place in the theatre. The dressing area with just a curtain as a door has very different temperatures in certain places. There is a broken mirror, which ALMOST always never works. Creepy all over. All you have to do is see a performance to witness the haunting of Mr. Shuler. Very cool.</p>
<p><strong>Roswell &#8211; Chaves County Courthouse- </strong>Young children are heard playing in the basement area at any time of the day or night. This place used to be the only execution site in New Mexico for many years.</p>
<p><strong>Roswell &#8211; New Mexico Military Institute &#8211; </strong>The New Mexico Military Institute does not use the phonetic alphabet &#8216;J&#8217; for Juliet for one of its troops for a very simple reason&#8230;it is believed to be cursed. Back in the 1800&#8217;s when the school was still an all male military school in the frontier Juliet troop was on of the troops to go out and defend the school from Indians and other Wild West characters. After one such excursion, no one from the Juliet troop survived. A tower with a clock was built in their honor and the letter &#8216;J&#8217; has not been used since. On some days when the sun is just right if you look up at the tower you can see faces in the rock of the boys who lost their lives looking back at you.</p>
<p><strong>Roswell &#8211; Pecan Fields &#8211; </strong>it seems to happen every Sunday during October, but if you drive down Country Club towards the pecan fields after midnight there is a little boy who runs across the street crying. if you listen you can hear the sounds of a little kid crying. he&#8217;ll look over to you. he has no legs.</p>
<p><strong>Roswell &#8211; Pueblo Auditorium &#8211;</strong> in the upstairs balcony you can see a boy, that is, until you go up there, then he disappears</p>
<p><strong>Ruidoso &#8211; Bonita Lake &#8211; </strong>Full of abandoned gold mines, this lake used to be a miners prospect. There is still an entire town underneath the lake. In the camping areas around the lake you can still find many miners carts, lanterns much of it untouched. There is a house in one part that many people camping in the area have reported strange lights coming from as well as sounds. &#8220;I thought there were a bunch of kids goofing off&#8221; claimed one camper. &#8220;It sounded like a party with music, lots of people talking and gunfire.&#8221; Later this camper discovered the only other people in the area were three adult campers and a border collie.</p>
<p><strong>Ruidoso Downs &#8211; Hale Lake &#8211; </strong>Eyewitnesses report many strange activities in Hale Lake Just outside of Ruidoso Downs. It is said that this is where a Settler, Indian dispute first took place. If you go there at night be sure to take friends. As you drive up the radio the heater and anything electrical will not work on your car. Be prepared to stay the night. If you drive down in the middle of the night the brakes on your car will not work. There is not a lake there, but rather a small pond. Many people have claimed to see faces in their campfires. Other reports include War Paint on their vehicles. Vehicles dieing in the middle of the night, and starting up in the morning with nothing apparently wrong with them. Illuminated Gates have been seen, as well as many reports of a man wearing all leather on horseback that many have thought they run over only to look back as the dust cleared to see him in their rearview mirror. The dreams that people have while camped there are probably the most interesting aspect of the whole place though.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Fe &#8211; The College of Santa Fe &#8211; </strong>One ghost in particular paces in the shadows late at night. Another prominent ghost on campus is that of a decapitated nurse during WWII. The campus was an insane asylum during this time, and a post-war inmate snapped and cut off a nurse&#8217;s head. She has been seen walking in the hallways, which now lead to the cafeteria. Ask the students, they can tell you, and the whole college is haunted.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Fe &#8211; Grant Corner Inn &#8211;</strong> Rooms 4 and 8 and the hallway on the second floor are the primary haunting sites in this three- story house built in 1905. Objects falling on the floor, footsteps, and slamming doors are among the usual fare. There is also a grayish figure that appears in the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Fe &#8211; The Heritage Home &#8211;</strong> an old turn-of-the-century site where criminals were hung from the large cottonwood in front of the building. The tree&#8217;s limbs have long since been cut down, however the shadows of the limbs are still casting on moonlit nights.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Fe &#8211; La Fonda Hotel &#8211; </strong>The present dining room in this lovely old hotel is situated exactly over an old well, in which a man leapt to his death over 100 years ago. He had lost his company&#8217;s money gambling. Guests in the dining room sometimes report seeing a man walk to the center of the room and then jump as if into an invisible hole and simply disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Fe &#8211; La Posada Hotel &#8211; </strong>the ghost of Julie Stabb is seen on the 2nd floor.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Fe &#8211; The Old Hospital Building downtown &#8211; </strong>Located downtown, the hospital was originally established as a sanitarium for victims of tuberculosis. It was the main hospital until the early 1980s when a new building was built. Until recently, it served as a nursing home. On the 4th floor, which originally served as the maternity ward, sounds of crying babies floated through the halls. There are reports of a child running through the halls as well.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Fe &#8211; Santa Fe Indian school &#8211;</strong> The dorms are known to be haunted.. at night you can see people being hung in the shadows, and hear screaming</p>
<p><strong>Truth or Consequences &#8211; The Hospital, located at 800 E. 9th St. &#8211;</strong> Ask any hospital employee that has worked at Sierra Vista Hospital for any length of time, especially if they worked a night shift and they will tell you about a paranormal experience they have had . This is an old hospital built in the early 1950`s and as a result tends to have a lot of sightings. Nurses will tell you that they will hear the sound of a baby crying a day before a baby will be delivered. There have been numerous times night shift staff will see ghosts out of the corner of their eye only to disappear when they turn to get a better look. Beds have raised and lowered by themselves without anyone at the helm operating the bed. Linen closet doors would open on their own as one would pass by. When the hospital first opened nuns operated it and would cook brownies for the patients. The nuns are long gone and do not work in the hospital any more, however their have been several sightings of the nuns cooking in the little kitchen area in the hall on the second floor. Also once in a while the smell of brownies cooking can be detected, but no one is cooking! A new hospital is scheduled to be built soon.</p>
<p><strong>Watrous &#8211; The Ranch &#8211; </strong>An old ranch house used for the &#8220;Pony Express&#8221; during the 1800&#8217;s.Residents of the house have awoken to a shot gun blast in the room with no one else in the house, a lady and man in a wagon with horse riding over a hill outside the window, when inspected the field over the hill was empty, also cold spots near fire place even when fire place is being used.</p>

									<p><strong>Adirondack Mountains &#8211; Big Moose lake &#8211;</strong> This was featured on unsolved mysteries and is the topic of books, and a movie called a place in the sun. In the early 1900s Grace Brown was drowned by her fiance, Chester Gilette. She haunts a cabin. Reports say that they have tried to pull the string on a light and they feel a cold hand, see her drowning, or see apparitions at the lake..</p>

<p><strong>Albany &#8211; Education Building </strong>&#8211; In the basement there is an elevator that leads to the sub-basement. The sub-basement goes down another four floors and is nicknamed &#8220;the dungeon&#8221;. It was said that when workers were laying the cement for the sub-basement a co-worker went mysteriously missing, his lunch and house keys were found but he wasn&#8217;t. It was assumed that when laying the cement floor he must have fallen in and no one saw it happen. People who are new to the building are told about this ghost and the name given to him, &#8220;Jason.&#8221; (for no real reason)To this day there have been many reports from people who travel down there for old documents and books. He will travel with you up the old steel elevators and you will get chills that will go all over your body. It feels like you have walked into a cold spot. And as soon as the chills start they will stop again. He will turn on the lights after they have been turned off (maybe to read so old books). He has also been known to help people look for books that they can&#8217;t find. Books will mysteriously fall off of shelves and it will be the book that you were looking for. People say that they can feel him watching them work when they work down in &#8220;the dungeon&#8221;. Many people have seen him out of the corner of their eye, but as soon as you turn your head to look at him he&#8217;s gone again. He&#8217;s also scared a few people enough to never want to go down there alone or again but he has never harmed anyone. He&#8217;s become a part of everyday life with all of the people who work in the sub-basement.</p>
<p><strong>Albany &#8211; Sage College of Albany &#8211; Formerly &#8211; Junior College of Albany/Russell Sage &#8211; </strong>Fine Arts building on Albany Campus have numerous ghosts that still can be heard.

<p><strong>Albany &#8211; Wolf Road &#8211; Professor Java&#8217;s Coffee Sanctuary &#8211; </strong>Middle age gentlemen seen in walking past mirrors but when you turn there is no one there. Workers hear noises at night and sometimes lights come off and on. Spirit does not like to be around when there are many people but late during the night you get a strange feeling of heaviness and even hairs sticking up on your arms. A spirit of a dog can also be sometimes heard and seen. Building has gone many extensive renovations. It was once an old house, and then renovated to a hair stylist, it also has been reported by several people to have been at one time a secret illegal meth production house that was shut down. Spirit has been felt standing behind people and in some cases breathing down their necks behind them or being lightly touched or pushed. The activity stems from the basement. Some workers refuse to go down there by themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Albany County &#8211; Selkirk &#8211; GE Plastics &#8211; </strong>The site of GE in Selkirk used to be the Becker farm. It is over 300 acres. The original farm house is still intact and was occupied on and off with offices until March of 2004. There had been many stories from employees on what they had seen or heard. The story goes that Mr. Becker caught his wife having sex with one of the slaves. He took the slave and pushed him down a very narrow out of the way set of slave stairs and he died, he then took a knife and killed his wife by cutting her head off or attempting to anyway. He was so grief stricken about his wife having an affair and the fact that he killed her, he went to the basement and hung himself. When in the basement sometimes the lights will all blow out or other things will turn on and off. And when on the second floor where he supposedly killed his wife there is a strange smell, kind of like perfume. And when going up or down the slave stairs you get a strange sense of being watched or followed. There are also motion detectors and intrusion alarms. some guards say there that sometimes they will go off, when the building is completely empty. And they will go off in a strange order, sometimes near the basement and then almost immediately near the stairs. Sometimes it appears as if someone is walking through. They will check the system to see who accessed the Becker House and see that no one has.</p>

An eerie postscript: before her death, Capt.

The college then turned the fourth floor of the main building into an infirmary.

Rumors are told that at some point in the past it was told that a man had been wrongly convicted of committing murder. Either as punishment or in holding before his punishment he was placed in a small shack at the end of Whiskey Hollow Road. Due to some mysterious circumstances the man died in that shack before his execution or during his incarceration there.

The most pronounced story is that of the Jesus Tree (cut down in the early 1990&#8217;s). This tree with the image of Jesus on the crucifix was said to &#8220;bleed&#8221; a red substance from its trunk when they cut it down. There are twelve trees evenly spaced and equal in stature directly following where the Jesus Tree stood. These are said to be the twelve apostles. When you travel farther down the road (eastbound), you come to a very curious looking estate. this ominous looking estate is actually Morefar Golf Club. This is believed to be a cover for something else. Word of links to the Satanic church have been bantered about. The main entrance has a sign reading &#8220;Back &#8216;o Beyond&#8221;. Interesting welcome for a country club. Immediately following Morefar, and across the street is Farrington Pond. There have been several stories about people driving off the road, into the pond, claiming to have seen &#8220;something&#8221;. The undifinitive story of this pond is that a young lady, on her way to a High School Prom, went off the road and into the pond. She was said to have drowned. When the moonlight hits the water, people have been known to see an image in a prom dress on top of the water, dancing &#8211; alone. In 1988, a young man named Dean, was found in his car on the side of the pond (just off the road), dead from gun shot wounds to the back of his head. The two men who were responsible were captured within a week. It is unknown whether this has anything to do with the spirit of the pond, but, if nothing else, it adds to the eeriness of the road.</p>

<p><strong>Bronx &#8211; Strawberry Fields of Silver Beach Gardens &#8211; </strong>In the fields at the edge of this small beach town, stands an old abandoned farmhouse overlooking the water. People say that a large mansion once accompanied the farmhouse. The residents of the mansion were very wealthy and many people were jealous of them. One man went to the extreme and caught their house on fire. The entire house was destroyed, but the family was able to escape to the farmhouse in time. The police came to investigate, but feared the people of Silver Beach would move if they heard about the arson. The police simply said that there was a tragic fire and the family had died. They even went as far as to say the field could be used for children to play. The suspect was never found, and the family continued to live secretly in the farmhouse. In 1950, ten years after the fire, the suspect who set the fire returned. He murdered the entire family the night before Halloween by stabbing them to death. The next evening, a group of teenagers came to the field to hang out. The young daughter, who had been able to escape the murderer, was going crazy looking for her family.

<p><strong>Brooklyn &#8211; Most Holy Trinity Church &#8211;</strong> January 2006: New information has been issued for this haunting, the submission has been rewritten.<br />
The church was built between 1882 and 1885; the school, built in 1887, is located on a site that had been a cemetery from 1841 until 1853. The church&#8217;s first two pastors, priests who had been Vicar Generals of the Brooklyn Diocese, are buried in a crypt under the narthex of the church. There are mysterious passageways on the &#8220;triforium&#8221; level of the church where it is said that only priests are able to enter. Originally posted for this haunting it was mentioned Bishops where buried here, this is untrue. NO BISHOPS WERE EVER BURIED AT THE CHURCH. The church property covers an entire city block; it is said that there are false closets leading to tunnels throughout the church and convent. Mysterious sub-basements and bricked-up doorways suggest concealed passageways. It is said that run-away slaves used these areas to hide when escaping to the North. A number of people have died while praying in the church. The church&#8217;s second pastor built the church&#8217;s rectory in 1872; he died in the building while sleeping in his second-floor room in 1895; the same room is used as a guest room by the priest who live in the building today. No-one wishes to take up permanent residence in the room in which the priest died. Guests have claimed to have heard strange noises and the sounds of someone walking back and forth while staying in the room. It is said that loud footsteps can be heard up and down the four floors of stairs at late hours of the night. Dogs have been known to stare, as in a trance, at the stairs leading to the basement and into the dining room when it has been very cold in the house. It always feels like other people are in the building, even when someone is alone there. The lights in the school gym have been known to go on and off without any reasonable explanation. At night, it is said that voices, and the sounds of people walking back and forth, can be heard in the school building. George Stelz, the parish sexton and bell ringer, was murdered in the vestibule of the church in August of 1897; while there was a prime suspect in the crime (a man who had been a parishioner of Trinity, and who was eventually executed for a different murder), no-one was ever convicted of the Stelz murder. The blood of Mr. Stelz, as well as the bloody hand-print of the murderer, are said to be still on the wall in a stairway leading to the bell tower. It is said that the spirit of Mr. Stelz roams the building and will do so until the crime is solved. The name of Mr. Stelz appears in a stained glass window he had donated to the church twelve years before his murder. The bells to the church are said to ring sometimes without explanation; it is believed that the ghost of Mr. Stelz rings the bells in order that people will not forget him after all these 109 years since his murder.

She had no friends and her father built her a stone club house on the property for her to play. She liked animals and wuld play with them in her stone clubhouse. Supposedly she was possessed by a spirit and started mutilating the animals on a stone table in her clubhouse. Later on she killed her father and her brother with an axe. After the some time the townspeople went to see what had happened the the land owner and found her sleeping in her fathers bed with him covered in blood. They hung her on a tree on the property. The tree is there on the side of the road. It always looks dead all year long. The burn marks from her rope are on the tree branch. Up the hill is the house. You can see a figure sitting in the window looking down on the road. Now that part of the house is supposed to be blocked off. Her stone clubhouse is on the road just a bit further up. The way it went was back in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s you were the big tough guy if you went up to Mary&#8217;s grave and urinated on it.

<p>Newburgh &#8211; Plum Point Condos &#8211; The story goes&#8230; There is a rather large building, in which is now know Plum Point condo&#8217;s, in Newburgh NY that used to be a all boys Christian school. One of the nun&#8217;s molested the boy &amp; killed him then put his body in the wall and covered it up well (being there was already construction going on inside it was a good cover-up, he was just reported missing) Then about a year later strange things would happen that drove the school to shut down. For about 10 or more years now they have been trying to make it into an apartment complex because there are condo&#8217;s all around it, and every time someone goes in there to work, a hand was cut off by machinery, the machinery would break for no apparent reason, etc.. And many people have said they have seen the boy. &#8211; October 2005 Correction: The above submission is the &#8220;popular word about town&#8221; regarding the information on our site, however, most of it is not true. Unfortunately, this same description regarding Plum Point on many websites. Probably cutting and pasting from this site. A visitor to our site reports the following: &#8220;Before the condos went in, there was a large mansion (complete with detached servant&#8217;s quarters.) It was originally constructed for a family who met an untimely death. The mansion then became a home for wayward girls for many years and eventually an orphanage of sorts, accepting children who were not only parentless, but had no where to run. This is where the rumors of the molestation occurrence sprouts from. The molestation may be true, but in all my research and hearing of rumors, I have never heard a report of anyone being buried in the walls.<br />
Eventually, the mansion became a hotel, had an addition put on both sides of the original building, and then was abandon for many years (The room numbers were still on the doors during abandonment.) The property changed hands uneventfully several times as Plum Point started building north of the property. The condo construction went fine UNTIL there was finally a developer who had funding to begin working on the mansion itself. By this time, condominium construction was creeping around all sides of the mansion.<br />
They developer intended to knock down the servant&#8217;s quarters which was a small home just a few yards to the south of the mansion. Heavy equipment was brought in, but would break down every time they attempted to start the job. Eventually, the fire department attempted to burn the house down and failed. if I remember correctly, an article appeared either in the Newburgh News or Times Herald Record regarding this, however I cannot be certain enough to state this as fact. There was no record of a worker losing a hand in the information I remember seeing. Eventually, the building was torn down by hand.<br />
Currently, Plum Point Condos have engrossed the entire area all the way down to the beach of the Hudson River. The mansion has been rebuilt and turned into several condos and stands proud today, however, a shell of its&#8217; former glory.<br />
Regarding the haunting phenomenon, there have been many reports of a women/girl holding a baby in the same 2nd floor window of the mansion looking out at the cars driving by. No one really knows if the ghost was a resident from the girl&#8217;s home, or the original owner, other than to say the girl appeared fairly young. I witnessed this ghosts myself while walking by the mansion one winter night.<br />
When the mansion was abandon, doors would frequently slam open and shut while trespassers were walking down the narrow hallway. Rumors regarding this range from a single boy ghost to a group of mischievous boy ghosts having fun with their &#8220;living guests&#8221; As &#8220;their&#8221; actions never appeared or felt threatening according to witnesses. A female ghost was frequently reported coming down the sweeping staircase in the main hall. This was heralded by a noticeable temperature drop in the area.<br />
Trespassers inside the mansion itself while it was abandon, who were cut by objects inside the house, would bleed for unordinary amounts of time. I witnessed this myself on several occasions. In one case, a friend of mine was cut by a piece of black fireplace marble. He bled for the rest of the day and into the evening despite the cut appearing to be small and superficial, my friend being in perfect health and treating the cut properly.<br />
A crying baby could often be heard down by the riverfront near the railroad tracks, just over the hill, a short walk towards the river from the mansion. Trains used to frequently stop on this section of tracks. Rumors said that many men who rode in the caboose of the freight train would often hear a baby cry. When they would get out to investigate, they would never be able to find the child. When they would approach the area where the crying was coming from, the crying would start from somewhere else close by.<br />
Condos have now been built on this spot (formerly a very swampy area) and I do not know if this phenomenon continues today. People currently live in the mansion, however, the current state of haunting phenomenon there is unknown as well. &#8221;</p>

<p>Oyster Bay &#8211; Raynham Hall &#8211; The home was originally owned by the Townsend family. The house was used as a base for the British during the Revolutionary War. John Andre was a British Major during the war and visited often. One day Townsend&#8217;s daughter overheard Andre and John Simcoe (Commander of British Forces) talking about a payment to Benedict Arnold to surrender his troops. The Townsends relayed this information to George Washington. Benedict Arnold escaped, but Andre was captured and hanged. His ghost was first reported here in the 1930s when he was seen on horseback outside a bedroom window. John Andre isn&#8217;t the only ghost here. Sally Townsend, allegedly John Simcoe&#8217;s lover is said to still haunt the house. Her former bedroom is always cold, even in the summer the curator wears a warm wool vest in that room! Paranormal investigators have said that whatever is in that room is not happy. In October of 1999 a volunteer was working on the property when the garden door opened and a man came out wearing a dark wool coat with brass buttons. First it was strange to see someone wearing that clothing, second the building was locked, and third the alarms were all on! In march another worker saw the same ghost materialize by the staircase. Once with the bottom half of his body missing, and then again full-figure. The ghost is believed to be Michael Conlin, an Irish immigrant who worked as a servant in the 1860&#8217;s. In the upstairs of the former servants quarters moving shadows have been seen when no one else is in the house. In that same area the smell of roses has mysteriously been sensed. The spirit of a servant woman has materialized and walked into the kitchen. In that kitchen the smell of apple pie has also been present when ghosts want to make themselves known. The submitter was extremely privileged when they smelled the strong scent of cinnamon-apple on their way down the stairs near the kitchen. When they got down to the bottom of the stairs they could smell the strong scent of something like cinnamon rolls or apple pie! Another area that is said to produce some interesting smells is the front foyer. The smell of a non-existent stove has been sensed there as well as the faint smell of a smoking pipe. At one time this was the kitchen area. The former museum director Andrew Batten says he has sensed at least 5 different entities and something in Sally Townsend&#8217;s room.</p>

About 10-15ft from the area at which the camper&#8217;s sleep is a steep hill (about 80deg.), with a large creek at the bottom. A boy known as Riley was found at the bottom of that hill in the creek one morning after a campout. He was though to have slept walked off the side of the hill.

<p>Westchester &#8211; Buckhout Road &#8211; On the border of White Plains, NY and possibly New Castle, NY, there is a road tucked away in the woods. Buckhout road evidently dates way back to the early days of the country, 1600&#8217;s. the local magistrate or some such, (an influential person in the area nonetheless) by the name of Isaac Buckhout suspected that his wife was cheating on him with a friend of his. He invited the friend and his son over to dinner one night where he proceeded to take a shotgun and kill the two of them as well as his wife. Afterward he walked a good 12-15 miles to Tarrytown and sat in a pub until the police picked him up a few hours later. The jury that tried him deliberated for days over his sentence but as the story goes he was the last man hung in White Plains, NY. Now apparently off the main road there are several side roads wherein if you walk into the woods you will see houses that have been abandoned. Further legend has it that back in the 1600&#8217;s three women were burned at the stake supposedly for witchcraft where the road now lies. There have been reports of their spirits supposedly roaming the area around the road and rumors tell a story of three X&#8217;s being painted on the road to mark the spot where the woman died. As legend goes, if you drive over these X&#8217;s and stop, your car will stall and &#8220;strange things will happen.&#8221; Exactly what is not known.

									<p><strong>Bloemfontein &#8211; Jim Fouché High School &#8211; </strong>Girl mysteriously disappeared in 1961.

<p><strong>Cape Town &#8211; Cape Town Castle &#8211;</strong>This castle is probably world renowned for it&#8217;s historical purposes. It was a castle build in the 1600&#8217;s for protection of Cape Town harbor against foreign invaders. Many slaves and traitors were held captive here&#8230;and tortured to death. The castle is a museum today and open to the public. Off course it&#8217;s got quite a few spooks haunting it. The &#8216;hole&#8217;, a tiny cell with no windows were used to torture the inmates. No sunlight what so ever entered this room/cell. After a time in the &#8216;hole&#8217;, the inmate would be blindfolded and taken out into the courtyard where the blindfold would be removed and they were forced to look at the sun and were blinded by doing so. That &#8216;hole&#8217; screams of terror.</p>

It is as if the voices, stench and eerie feelings are a couple of feet from you and then and random intervals violently attack. It is a deserted hole in the mountain with a stagnant pool of water in the center-Quite beautiful during the day.</p>

<p>New South Wales &#8211; Kurri Kurri &#8211; Richmond Vale Rail &amp; Mining Museum &#8211; Richmond Main is an abandoned mine which operated from 1910 to 1967. Today, it is a steam railway and mining museum. During its operating life, there were 54 lives lost from accidents and mistakes. In 1922, a mine shaft which can travel 300 feet underground, and is preserved today, was taking five miners down to the bottom of the pit. Its cable snapped when the shaft cage was still 200 feet from the ground. All the miners lost there lives (the records of the incident still exist). Today, about five out of ten people who visit the museum, and have had a look at the abandon shaft, say that they feel very sad. Some say they can hear the sounds of people yelling out, as if they are falling. Also, strange things happen to some of the steam locomotives preserved at the museum. Some of the drivers have said that various controls on the loco&#8217;s N o. 30 go haywire. A former South Maitland Railway&#8217;s loco is the engine that has strange things done to it. The throttle will be fully open for the locomotive to move, when the drivers have left it in the closed position. There are also incidents where there the driver, the fireman or both are in the cab, and the engine&#8217;s whistle will be pulled right in front of them, without either of them pulling the whistle cord. It is said to be a sprit of the former manager, Mr. John Brown, who died there in 1930 (cause of death not known). He has been seen early in the morning, firing off the steam loco for a days run. Two museum members have seen him, and they refused to ever work in that area ever again. Mr. Brown is seen on the third Sunday of each month, five out of ten times.</p>

It&#8217;s also believed that the body of Groundskeeper Brown was buried at the school. Brown killed himself on March 29th, 1940. On every March 29th, he appears around the whole school, and protects himself and his grounds from any moving object within a 100 meter radius.</p>
<p>South Australia &#8211; Barossa Valley &#8211; Seppeltsfield Winery &#8211; Built in the early 1800s by Oscar Benno Seppelt, who is said to have turned slightly insane after spending hours confined in his private retreat, located behind the trophy cellar. If you go on one of their ghost tours held in the summer months, you feel as if you are being watched all the time. Walking through the barrel tunnel, you can hear loud footsteps above you, but there is no floor above you. After 7PM, the lights will not turn on in the lower levels. The ghostly apparition of a maid is said to haunt the homestead and tunnels. If you walk past the distillery and other cellars, you can hear screaming in the vineyards and see glowing in the top tower of the distillery. While walking past the Vinegar factory, you can hear the machines working, wheels cranking and the sounds of steam blasts, even though the factory has been locked for over 150 ye ars. During the tours, you can go into Oscar’s retreat, which is so small it can only fit a maximum of 4-5 people who even have to duck their heads to walk in. In the Mausoleum of the Seppelt family, you can see eerie bloodstains on the walls, which are still wet on the anniversary of their deaths. Due to this, the Mausoleum was locked and bolted shut in the late 20th century. Moans and whispering can be heard in the dinning hall, which you can hire for functions. Staff and tourists in the garden have heard rifle shots. These ghost tours are not for the faint hearted, and no tapes, projectors or computers are used at all. Also not recommended for children under ten years old. Walk through the gardens as you hear stories of near death experiences and listen to the screams and shots through the air. Many tourists have felt cold spots, and being pushed by invisible forces. Others have told of feeling depressed near the gardens, and even being frightened into screaming fits.</p>
<p>South Australia &#8211; Kapunda &#8211; Cemetery &#8211; Kapunda is a mining town just two hours from Adelaide. It is an old mining town. A young girl haunts the local cemetery there.

Grover was transported to Van Diemen&#8217;s Land in 1825 for stealing, and by 1829 records show him as the flagellator at Richmond. His death in early March 1832 resulted in an inquest, concluding that he had laid down while drunk, and &#8220;fell or was pushed&#8221; from the parapet of the bridge, 27 feet in height. Grover&#8217;s ghost is said to appear on the bridge at certain times. The ghost of a large black and white dog, sometimes called &#8216;Grover&#8217;s Dog&#8217;, is also seen on the bridge. One lady reports it appearing at her side on several occasions, as she walked the bridge at night. It would walk alongside her from one end to the other, and then disappear as quickly as it had come.</p>
<p>Tasmania &#8211; Theatre Royal &#8211; The theatre has been haunted for many years by a deceased actor/stagehand named Fred. Fred is frequently seen in theatre, both backstage and in the audience.

Many believe it was Fred who lowered the curtain to save his beloved theatre, so the show could go on.</p>

Also, passersby report seeing apparitions in the window. The place is currently a function hall, but no one is allowed access to the staircase. The main gate closes by itself, and lights go on and off when there is apparently no one home.</p>

									<p><strong>Besancon &#8211; Downtown &#8211;</strong> A man was driving down a road at a very high speed and crashed into a brick wall. At night time, you can hear squealing tires, and a man saying, &#8220;Merde!&#8221; (French curse word) before hearing a crash.</p>
<p><strong>Blois &#8211; Fougeacuteres Sur Bieacutevre &#8211; </strong>Poltergeist outbreaks with loud banging noises on house walls, things being frozen in ice and eerie figures that make themselves noticed from the window sills.</p>
<p><strong>Lyons &#8211; Seyssuel &#8211; </strong>Rumor has it that there was once a school ground that got destroyed in World War One. Since the village was re-built in the late 1920s, ever since then, there have been reports of poltergeist activities, contagious laughter and singing.</p>
<p><strong>Paris &#8211; Best Western Montparnasse &#8211;</strong> Reports of awaking from strange dreams to see a bright wispy blue hand and arm directly over their face.</p>
<p><strong>Paris &#8211; The Catacombs &#8211;</strong> Found Camera and video, of an explorer, the footage shows him running, and being afraid of something. He was never found.</p>
<p><strong>Paris &#8211; Eiffel Tower &#8211;</strong> One night, a girl and her boyfriend went out. The girl arranged the date to break up with him. He wanted to propose to her. When she told him, he erupted. He took her to the top of the Eiffel tower, and threatened her. She didn&#8217;t believe him, because he had always been so nice to her. So when he said if she married him, he would spare her, she said NO. Then, he pushed her off the top! At night, you can hear a girl laughing and saying NO, then a scream, and silence.</p>
<p><strong>Versailles &#8211; Chateau of Versailles &#8211;</strong> This was the home of the French royal family from 1682 to 1789, when the French Revolution began, and in the end, the King and Queen were beheaded. People experience seeing people in 18th century clothing and a different landscape from what it is today. It is said that you travel back in time during their visit. Also an odd silence is heard. The most famous ghost of this palace is Marie Antoinette herself, the queen who was beheaded long ago.</p>
<p><strong>Vimey Ridge &#8211;</strong> One student tells of hearing the sounds of the war. Another described being grabbed by someone who looked like they were in a period movie about the site and being told to &#8220;run for your life you stupid kid&#8221; and being shoved towards the tunnel exit. As they were exiting the tunnel, yet another student tells of seeing, in plain daylight, a soldier stepping on a land mine and then nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Vimy Ridge &#8211; Canadian trenches &#8211;</strong> Soldiers have been awoken by the sounds of heavy breathing and gear rustling, we where startled and amazed to see a German soldier in full ww1 combat gear attempting to &#8220;stick&#8221; them with a bayonet.</p>

									<p><strong>Afghan &#8211; Tajikistan border &#8211; Hindu Kush mountains &#8211; </strong>The &#8220;Ail&#8221;, feminine looking entities with floating hair, pale eyes resembling milky white orbs and glacier pale skin are said to inhabit the region whenever the suns rises so high, that you cannot see your own shadow, or at twilight. Even though they normally go on about their business, it is best to treat them with respect, since the Ail are known to be quite violent and hostile. That is why you almost never see any villagers or nomads out during those times in the day.<br />
<strong><br />
Kabul &#8211; Kabul University &#8211;</strong> It has been told that some of the abandoned dorms and abandoned classrooms were used by the Taliban to torture and kill people whom dare defy them. While some foreign aid workers were helping out on re-building Kabul University, it was said by many that they smelled the foul scent of rotting flesh, feces and other bodily wastes. Others said they also saw the entities of the victims that were tortured to death by the Taliban or heard screaming and crying in pain, when there was no one there.</p>

									<p><strong>Atsugi Naval Air Base &#8211; BEQ 985 &#8211;</strong> The spirit of a young man is often seen wandering from room to room. Believed to be the ghost of a marine that was killed in a car accident in the 1960&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Hiroshima &#8211;</strong> It was said that the souls of the nuclear bomb victims at the end of World War 2 haunt the area. voices, pleading for help, crying and screaming can be heard around twilight. It was also said that some of those souls sometimes lurk in the shadows of the living.</p>
<p><strong>Iwakuni &#8211; Barracks 1687 Room 301 &#8211;</strong> A Marine living in that room a few years ago committed suicide. In a drunken rage the Devil Dog broke the mirror in his room and slit his wrists with the broken pieces. From Marines checking in and out of that room since then, late at night if you look at the mirror you can see a Marine staring at you from the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>Kanagawa &#8211; Atsugi Naval Air Facility &#8211; The Corrosion Hangar Bay &#8211;</strong> Located on the other side of the base stands over the old hangar used by Imperial Japan Kamikaze pilots. After Imperials surrender, many pilots killed themselves in this hangar for disgracing their nation.. At night, you can hear doors slamming on their own and sightings of floating &#8220;red eyes&#8221; can be seen from inside the bay. There was one incident during watch in which a man dressed in a Imperial era uniform walked through the bay access doors and out the back exit.</p>
<p><strong>Kanagawa Prefecture &#8211; field hospital &#8211; </strong>The hospital is an old field hospital located on a military base by the name of Sagami Depot. There have been reports of noises and individuals walking around in the hospital. The building is seldom used but at night when security checks on it they often find a windows raised or a door that ha been locked previously unlocked. The Military police usually have a new soldier go there to conduct checks his first night on the job. Many have reported hearing some one walking around inside. The Japanese have experienced the same.</p>
<p><strong>Nagasaki &#8211; Like Hiroshima</strong>, it was also said that the souls of the nuclear bomb victims in Nagasaki at the end of World War 2 haunt the area. voices, pleading for help, crying and screaming can be heard around twilight. It was also said that some of those souls sometimes lurk in the shadows of the living.</p>
<p><strong>Okinawa &#8211; Camp Hansen &#8211; Gate #3 &#8211; </strong>Every weekend at night a soldier dressed in WWII gear, with blood all over his fatigues, a cigarette in his hand, and would ask the gate guard the same thing. &#8220;Gotta light?&#8221; Usually, the MP would light the cigarette for the soldier. As soon as it was lit, the GI would disappear. Update: this gate is closed because of this haunting; they had problems keeping a Japanese Sentry at this gate.</p>
<p><strong>Okinawa &#8211; Camp Hansen &#8211; Gate #3 (Across the road from) &#8211;</strong> there was a fierce Samurai battle down that road one time. They said that at night, you can still hear the moans from the wounded Samurai Warriors, as they lay there dieing.</p>
<p><strong>Okinawa &#8211; Gate One MCAS Futenma &#8211; </strong>Apparition of an Okinawa man from the waist up.</p>
<p><strong>Okinawa &#8211; Machinato &#8211;</strong> HQ Spec Troops Barracks &#8211; Doors opening, cold spots, manual plumbing working automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Okinawa &#8211; The WWII Room &#8211;</strong> Witnesses have felt things touch them that were cold with no wind in contact.</p>
<p><strong>Okinawa &#8211; USAF Storage Area &#8211;</strong> This whole island is haunted, mainly from WWII. One of the many haunted areas is in the Munitions Storage Area on Kadena AB. Along one of the main roads is a small clearing for people to stop and fish in the lake there or do whatever. It is reported that some nights when it&#8217;s foggy, people will be sitting at that clearing (security forces looking for speeders) doing whatever. They will hear noises like feet stomping on the ground. Then they will look out onto the lake and see a whole battalion of Japanese soldiers marching on the water. Then all of the sudden that person is surrounded by all the soldiers. Then they just disappear.Okinowa Experience</p>
<p><strong>Tokyo &#8211; Akasaka &#8211; Weekly mansion Akasaka &#8211;</strong> There have been reports from many people that the weekly mansion building No.1 is haunted.  Many have seen visions standing at the end of their beds, white mists coming in through the air vents, the room becoming suddenly very cold there have also been reports of lights going out or coming on by themselves, television and radios turning themselves on and a feeling of someone stroking their heads while they sleep and even being pushed into the bed by some unknown force being forced into a state of being so frozen they cannot move.  One person even repirted being dragged from her bed to the other side of the room and then back again, she had scratches on her back the next day!</p>
<p><strong>Tokyo &#8211; Outskirts &#8211;</strong> Outside Tokyo is a haunted mansion that was the basis of the game &#8220;Fatal Frame&#8221;. It is said there are other houses close by linked to the past of the mansion. People who have gone in there were later found by police with rope marks on their wrists, legs, and neck. There are also vast tunnels under this mansion but it is unknown what they&#8217;re for. Sometimes during the day you can photograph a small girl in a kimono in one of the windows</p>
<p><strong>Tokyo &#8211; Square Building</strong> &#8211; A bluish male child wandering the halls at night. If he thinks he has been seen he will disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Yokohama &#8211; Ikego &#8211; The middle gate &#8211;</strong> A World War 2 concentration camp. Where thousands of Chinese and Korean people were put to work and killed by the Japanese army. It is now a U.S. military housing Base. There are five incinerators that still stand today. It has three gates that keep it separate from the Japanese community. The Main Gate, The middle Gate and a back gate. At the middle gate, gate guards have experienced hearing voices, footsteps and a feeling of being watched. Some have reported a World War 2 Japanese soldier in a brown uniform with no legs between the middle gate and back gate.</p>
<p><strong>Yokosuka Naval Base &#8211; Gridley Tunnel &#8211;</strong> This is a narrow, one way tunnel that runs through a hill from Gridley Lane to Nimitz Blvd. There have been numerous reports of people driving through the tunnel and seeing a man dressed as a Samurai. The reports are all similar, the people are driving through the tunnel when they look in their rear view mirror and see a man dressed as a Samurai standing in the road behind their vehicle when there was no one in the tunnel a moment before. Some people have been so startled by this that they have wrecked their vehicles into the side of the tunnel. The sightings are reported most often on rainy nights between midnight and 1:00am. The base newspaper, The Seahawk, once featured a story on this haunting.  The rumor is that the apparition is the ghost of a Samurai who was on his way to avenge the death of his lord when he was ambushed and cut down in the tunnel. Because he failed in his mission of vengeance he can&#8217;t leave his place of death.</p>
