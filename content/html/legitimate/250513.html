But if computers are so good atrepetition, why is it that the users are the ones who keep repeating things?<P> Programming by example [or "programming by demonstration"*] is a technique for teaching the computer new behavior by demonstrating actions on concrete examples. The system records user actions and generalizes a program that can be used in new examples.<p><menu><li><H3>Where can I <a href="Learn-About.html">learn about Programming by Example?</a></H3><li><H3>Can I see some <a href="PBE-Examples.html">examples</a> of Programming by Example?</H3><li><H3><A href="PBE-Researchers.html">Who works on </A>Programming by Example?</h3><li><H3>I'm working on a Programming by Example related project, and I'd like to <a href="Contribute.html">contribute to</a> this page.</H3><P></menu><hr><P>*(We decided to call this page "Programming by Example", but "Programming by Demonstration" is also used to designate this research area.<hr>This page is maintained by <P>Henry Lieberman<ADDRESS><a href="mailto:lieber@media.mit.edu">lieber@media.mit.edu</a></ADDRESS>
