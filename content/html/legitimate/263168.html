<title>Information Infrastructure Task Force</title>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<h1>THE INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE</h1>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
         While the private sector will build and run virtually all of
the National Information Infrastructure (NII), the President and
the Vice President have stated clearly that the Federal
government has a key leadership role to play in its development. 
Accordingly, the White House formed the Information
Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) to articulate and implement the
Administration's vision for the NII.  The task force consists of
high-level representatives of the Federal agencies that play a
major role in the development and application of information
technologies.  Working together with the private sector, the
participating agencies will develop comprehensive
telecommunications and information policies that best meet the
needs of both the agencies and the country.  By helping build
consensus on thorny policy issues, the IITF will enable agencies
to make and implement policy more quickly and effectively.
<p>
         A high-level Advisory Council on the National Information
Infrastructure has been  established by Executive Order to
provide advice to the IITF.  It will consist of  representatives
of the many different stakeholders in the NII, including
industry, labor, academia, public interest groups, and state and
local governments.  The Secretary of Commerce will appoint the 25
members of the advisory committee.
<p>
         The IITF is working closely with the High Performance
Computing, Communications, and Information Technology (HPCCIT)
Subcommittee of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science,
Engineering, and Technology (FCCSET), which is chaired by the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.  The HPCCIT
Subcommittee provides technical advice to the IITF and
coordinates Federal research activities that support development
of the National Information Infrastructure.  
<p>
<p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
         
         All the key agencies involved in telecommunications and
information policy are represented on the task force.  The task
force operates under the aegis of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy and the National Economic Council. 
<a href="/dykki/pics/ron.gif">Ron Brown</a>, the
Secretary of Commerce, chairs the IITF,
and much of the staff work for the task force will be done by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the
Department of Commerce.
<p>
<p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>
To date, three committees of the IITF have been established:
<p>
(1)  Telecommunications Policy Committee, which will formulate a
consistent Administration position on key telecommunications
issues, is chaired by <a href="/nii/irving.html">Larry Irving,</a> head of the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the
Department of Commerce.  Recently, the Committee created:
<p>
<ul><li>     The Working Group on Universal Service, which will work to
         ensure that all Americans have access to and can enjoy the
         benefits of the National Information Infrastructure.
</ul><p>
(2)  Information Policy Committee, which is addressing critical
information policy issues that must be addressed if the National
Information Infrastructure is to be fully deployed and utilized. 
Sally Katzen, head of the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), chairs the
Committee.  The Committee has created three working groups:
<p>
<ul><li>     The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, to
         develop proposals for protecting copyrights and other IPR in
         an electronic world.  Bruce Lehman, head of the Patent and
         Trademark Office of the Department of Commerce, chairs this
         group. 
<p>
<li>     The Working Group on Privacy, to design Administration
         policies to protect individual privacy despite the rapid
         increase in the collection, storage, and dissemination of
         personal data in electronic form.  It is chaired by Pat
         Faley, Acting Director of the Office of Consumer Affairs,
         Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li>     The Working Group on Government Information focuses on ways
         to promote dissemination of government data in electronic
         form.  Bruce McConnell, OMB's Office of Information and
         Regulatory Affairs, chairs this group.
</ul><p>
(3)  Applications Committee, which coordinates Administration
efforts to develop, demonstrate, and promote applications of
information technology in manufacturing, education, health care,
government services, libraries, and other areas.  This group
works closely with the High-Performance Computing and
Communications Program, which is funding development of new
applications technologies, to determine how Administration
policies can best promote the deployment of such technologies. 
<a href="Prabhakar.html">Arati Prabhakar</a>, Director of the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, chairs the committee.  This committee is
responsible for implementing many of the recommendations of the
Vice President's <a href="/npr/nptoc.html">National Performance Review</a> that pertain to
information technology.  So far, the Committee has created one
working group:
<p>
<ul><li>     The Working Group on Government Information Technology
         Services (GITS)  will coordinate efforts to improve the
         application of information technology by Federal agencies.
