<h1>The LWN.net Linux Distribution List</h1>

  You have found the <b>LWN.net Linux Distributions List</b>.  LWN
  has been tracking Linux distributions since 1999.  Early versions of the
  list consisted of links on the side bars of the weekly Distribution
  page.  By 2001 the list had grown to fill both sidebars of the weekly
  page, often trailing far below any actual mid-page content.  So the list
  was moved to a flat file and released on October 11, 2001.
  <p>
  The next major release was on February 7, 2002.  Additional information
  was added to each entry, and in the process links were fixed, entries
  moved to different categories and dead distributions were removed.  Minor
  revisions have been made almost every week since then.  A table of
  contents was added on May 9, 2002.  There have been no major releases
  since then, however new distributions are added when found, dead
  distributions are removed when found, and link checking remains an
  ongoing (low-priority) process. Many thanks to Andrew Cater for a massive
  link-checking effort that took place in May 2020, resulting in a smaller
  and more up-to-date list.
  <p>
  We once hoped that this list would move to a searchable database, however
  that now seems unlikely to happen. We do hope you will enjoy this
  celebration of Linux diversity, with distributions large and
  small, specialized and generalized, old and new.
  <p>
  Maintenance of this list ends December 31, 2021.

<h2>Leading Distributions</h2>
  Leading distributions have usually been around for a while and are
  well-established.  They generally support several architectures and are
  translated into multiple languages.  Some come from companies that supply
  service and support contracts for their products, others are community
  projects.

Android is Linux without any GNU.  Google backs Android, which can be found
in the wild in phones, tablets and other devices.  These devices usually
contain proprietary software, and some of the available apps are
proprietary as well.  See
the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/">Android Open Source
Project</a> for the open source parts.  Android was first announced
November 5, 2007.  Android 1.5 (Cupcake) was released April 30, 2009.
Android 4.4 (KitKat) was released October 31, 2013.  Android 5.1 (Lolipop)
was announced March 9, 2015.  Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) was released

  The Debian Project is one of the oldest distributions, dating back to
  1993, and is currently the largest volunteer-based distribution provider.
  Debian, the "universal operating system", has been translated into many
  languages; works on many hardware platforms; has a large repository with
  a wide variety of packages; includes experimental kernel variants for
  kfreebsd and the GNU Hurd; and has many derivatives. Debian Stable
  releases when ready, not on any fixed schedule, but stable releases
  happen about every two years and are supported for about 3 years. The
  LTS team provides commercial support for old-stable releases with
  security updates for a reduced set of packages after the Debian security
  team ends official support. The Debian testing branch (currently 12.0
  "bookworm") is where the next stable release is prepared; packages are
  more current than stable while (usually) providing a stable desktop.  The
  unstable branch (sid) is more bleeding edge, while the experimental
  branch contains packages that aren't yet ready for sid. Debian 13 will be
  named "trixie".  Debian 9.0 "stretch" was released June 17, 2017.  The
  13th and final stretch point release, Debian 9.13, was released July 18,
  2020.  The LTS team is maintaining stretch.  Debian 10.0 "buster" was
  released July 6, 2019. The eleventh buster point release, Debian 10.11,
  was released October 9, 2021.  Debian 11.0 "bullseye" was released August
  14, 2021. The second bullseye point release, Debian 11.2, was released
  December 18, 2021.

  The Fedora Project is Red Hat's community distribution.  It is intended
  to be a fast-paced distribution for those that like to stay on the
  leading edge of technology.  It is also a test-bed for Red Hat's
  Enterprise Linux products. The first Fedora Core release was dated
  November 5, 2003.  Fedora strives for a new release every 6 months and
  releases will be supported for about 13 months. Fedora Editions include
  Workstation and Server, with CoreOS and IoT in preview. Workstation comes
  with the GNOME desktop, while Fedora Spins provide alternate
  desktops. Fedora Labs target a variety of use cases, such as astronomy,
  design, scientific computing, and more. A number of architectures are
  supported.<br>

  months with 18 months of support, but now offers two
  options.  <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</a> uses
  a rolling release model that updates to the latest stable software, with
  frequent snapshots.  The more conservative openSUSE Leap is based on core
  SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) components with more up-to-date applications.
  Its releases follow SLE service packs, with the initial release (42.1)
  based on SLE 12 SP1.  Leap 42.1 was was released November 4, 2015 and
  reached eol May 16, 2017.  With the following release, openSUSE Leap 15

  Red Hat, Inc. provides one of the the best known Linux distributions in
  the world. In 2003 the company announced its decision to drop its
  popular Red Hat Linux in order to concentrate on the Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux line.  The Fedora Project (see above) has replaced the Red Hat
  Linux line for the home user or small business.  Red Hat Linux 9 was the
  last release in the Red Hat Linux series.  It was released April 7, 2003
  and was supported until May 1, 2004.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux comes with
  service and support contracts for those Red Hat customers who require a
  stable, supported system.  There are a number of other Red Hat products
  for cloud environments. Red Hat was acquired by IBM in July 2019, however
  no changes were planned for RHEL products and services, or for Fedora and
  CentOS. Supported versions: RHEL 7 was released June 10, 2014; now at
  update 7.9, released September 29, 2020. RHEL 8 was released May 7, 2019;

  and infrastructure, but are supported by the community.  Ubuntu takes a
  snapshot of Debian unstable and then creates a small fork, recompiling
  and stabilizing the code to get a final stable release. Ubuntu releases
  happen every 6 months, in April and October.  Ubuntu comes with the GNOME
  desktop, Kubuntu with the KDE Plasma desktop, Xubuntu features XFCE,
  Ubuntu Studio integrates packages for multimedia creation, Lubuntu comes
  with the LXQt desktop environment, Ubuntu Kylin has been localized and
  customized for users in China, Ubuntu MATE features the MATE desktop, and
  Ubuntu Budgie features the Budgie desktop.<br>
The first Ubuntu release was 4.10 Preview "Warty Warthog", released
  September 15, 2004.  Ubuntu LTS releases are supported for 5 years.
  Flavors usually have shorter LTS support windows.  Non-LTS releases are
  supported for 9 months. 22.04 "Jammy Jellyfish" is in development.<br>

<h2>Also well-known</h2>
  There is often a fine line between "leading" and "well-known"
  distributions.  Some might consider a few of these to be "leading"
  distributions.

  The Free Software Lab at the NCHC has combined Debian Live with

  the need for the computer being cloned to boot from a network.
  Clonezilla Live can be used to clone individual computers using a CD/DVD
  or USB flash drive.  Though the image size is limited by the boot media's
  storage capacity, this problem can be eliminated by using a network
  filesystem such as sshfs or samba.  Clonezilla live 1.2.1-53 (stable) was

  Porteus is a portable/live media Linux OS, based on Slackware and Linux
  Live Scripts which have been heavily modified by chief maintainer
  Fanthom.  In essence, Porteus is a portable Slackware which started out
  as Fanthom keeping the Slax OS up to date as a community remix
  project. Unlike a standard linux install, Porteus exists in a compressed
  state on the portable drive. It has no /root /bin /etc file structure on
  the portable device itself, rather this is created on the fly during the
  boot process, which only takes around 20-30 seconds on a relatively new
  computer. It is modular in design which means extra software comes in the
  form of  'modules' which can be activated and injected into the live file
  system. It does not need to be installed and uninstalled as you may
  expect with other operating systems which takes numerous amounts of
  clicks and agreements.  Porteus joined the list with the release of
  version 1.0 rc2 x86_64, dated May 7, 2011.  Porteus 1.0 was released June
  20, 2011.  Porteus 3.2.2 was released December 29, 2016.  Porteus Kiosk
  4.9.0 was released September 16, 2019. Porteus Kiosk 5.1.0 was released
