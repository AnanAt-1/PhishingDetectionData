The "grassroots army" is the affectionate pet name for supporters and fans of Miranda Stone.  Many of you aren't going 
to be in this section because we just can't fit you all in! Please forgive us!  But we thought it would be nice to throw 
a few pictures in here of some long-time friends.

His work can be seen all over this site as well as the inside of the Live album booklet. Not only is he a great photographer, but a brilliant writer as well, and has great musical taste. Dave hangs out in Oshawa, Ontario.</td>

They're one of the many warm-hearted hippy "mom and dad" couples that Miranda manages to find in almost every state and province when she's on the road. </td>

Sue got a crash course in touring when she came along for the ride one weekend.  She's enthusiastic and vibrant.  Todd is the world's biggest U2 fan and has a trunk full of posters, shirts and ticket stubs that he likes to show to houseguests.  It's really a glorified shrine and we're sure that he's lighting incense in front of it daily. </td>
