        Clash Of Armor At Kishinev</h1>

      <p>When Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the Nazis did not do so by themselves. 
        German diplomats had convinced several other European states to join the 
        attack, the most important being Romania. 
      <p>Romanian troops fought alongside the Germans at the key battle of Kishinev 
        in early July 1941, and this is the subject of <em>Red Steel. </em>The 
        Axis player is trying to get his or her army across the Prut River and 
        then through the hills of the Cornesti Massif to capture Kishinev, the 
        capital of Bessarabia. The Soviet player must prevent this. 
      <p> As with the other games that use this game system, most units are battalions 
        with some companies and small regiments. These usually belong to divisions, 
        and they operate more effectively together with units of the same division.

      <p>Units are rated for morale, attack, defense and movement. Superior morale 
        assists a unit in several game functions but particularly in combat. Tank 
        units are rated for armor quality; anti-tank units have a similar rating 
        used to fight tanks. 
      <p> Artillery is the most powerful weapon on the battlefield. Artillery 
        units may support an attack or a defense; German units are somewhat more 
        flexible than Soviet or Romanian ones thanks to better communications. 
        And artillery must be supplied; running out of artillery ammunition is 
        a very bad thing, and both players must choose where to use their shells. 
      <p>Each game &#8220;day&#8221; is divided into three daylight and one night 
        turns. The map is divided into hexagons (&#8220;hexes&#8221;) shows the 
        area around Kishinev at a scale of 2 kilometers per hex.

      <p>Axis forces include a German infantry division, at full strength with 
        excellent artillery support. There&#8217;s also a Romanian armored division, 
        with 10 companies of tanks (R2 and R35 types; see our piece on <a href="http://www.avalanchepress.com/EFRomanian.php">Romanian 
        forces in <em>Panzer Grenadier: Eastern Front</em></a> for more detail 
        on these). The Axis has a tough Romanian border guard division and a cavalry 
        brigade; the three Romanian regular infantry divisions are respectable 
        but all the Romanian divisions have weak artillery components. The Romanian 
        reserve infantry division is of terrible quality. The Axis side also has 
        the help of a battalion of Ukrainian Nationalist commandos fighting in 
        the Romanian army.

      <p>The Red Army of Workers and Peasants counters with two full tank divisions 
        and parts of a third. There&#8217;s also a mechanized division, four rifle 
        divisions and a mountain rifle division. The best Soviet formation is 
        the 2nd Cavalry Corps, which would become famous later in the war as the 
        1st Guards Cavalry Corps. Because the Red Army has been caught by surprise, 
        each turn the Soviet player is not sure which of his or her formations 
        will be able to move and fight, other than the cavalry (which is always 
        battle-ready). And the Soviets suffer from poor maintenance; every time 
        a Soviet tank unit moves there&#8217;s a chance it will suffer losses 
        from breakdowns. There are NKVD border guards as well, and the Soviet 
        player can call out the local militia (which may defect to the Romanians, 
        as this area was part of Romania until 1940). 
      <p>These factors balance out to create perhaps our most finely balanced 
        game in terms of competitive play. While <em>Red Steel</em> is not the 
        easiest game in the Avalanche Press catalog, it is generally considered 
        the closest contest for highly-skilled wargamers. There are five scenarios, 
        or game situations, and a wide variety of optional rules including the 
        river monitors of the Romanian Danube Flotilla.
