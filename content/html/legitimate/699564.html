The relationship between brands and consumers has shifted. The structure of communications has undergone this massive leap. While the smart thinking in marketing is leaping to embrace a whole new way of doing things, much of the practice in marketing still clings to the past. That's why it wasn't just gutsy, but a strategically brilliant move for Microsoft to use a television style commercial to make the point for them.</p>

			<div class="entry-content">
	<p><img alt="" src="http://www.digitaltrainingacademy.com/digitalmediasalesacademy/banner.jpg"  /><h3>A lesson from the Digital Creative Academy about why online advertising delivers impact</h3> We live in a media saturated world. Audiences have become experienced in advertising. Many media are at risk of being screened out; television commercials not seen when they are fast forwarded, sections of newspapers going unread… Yet on the web the advertising is delivered the very moment the viewer requests the next page of content. Rather than an ‘opportunity to see’ that’s a guaranteed view. This means the impact of online advertising can be that much greater. </p>

Minor variations in the way video advertising messages are delivered can have a disproportionate impact on the effectiveness of the commercials and the quality of the campaign.

If you’re a film company releasing a new blockbuster, when are people most receptive?

	<p>Selling online advertising is harder than selling print.

	<p>The world’s largest online ad market is still enjoying the largest annual growth in real terms. Spend surged ahead by 25.4%, crossing the $5bn mark in a single quarter. Boosted in particular by massive increases in the supply of media from social networks, and the continued switch of acquisition budgets into search, the wider media sector is hurting as budgets are displaced and advertisers follow their audiences. The big changes are now starting.</p>

	<p><img alt="OrgStr01-10.JPG" src="http://www.digitaltrainingacademy.com/digitalmediasalesacademy/OrgStr01-10.JPG" width="100" height="76" />When it comes to planning the set up and structure for a digital media business the economies of scale are different to those in classic media. In magazines and newspapers, centralising the buying of paper or the operations of accounts and HR functions is the norm, and the bulk of decision making and innovation moved to the editors and publishers of individual titles. However the economics work differently in digital media and there is a much broader economy of scale that means groups benefit from not only centralising the ‘plumbing’ (bandwidth, servers and IT management), but also in standardising the systems and platforms (content tools, analytics packages, advertising servers). This leaves the publishing and editorial teams free to be creative within the content, but without having to build and constantly refine the structures and templates around the business.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.digitalstrategyconsulting.com/images/ifra.gif" alt="" />Getting online news media to earn real revenues is a tougher challenge than many newspaper directors expect. Web advertising spend may now be larger than newspaper advertising in many countries, but that doesn’t mean newspapers can expect a big share. The search engines, portals and sales networks continue to dominate the sector, and as the next wave of revenue pours into social media like Facebook, newspaper sites need to fight to earn their share.</p>

A few years on, does the promise measure up to reality, or does this sound more familiar: “we’re drowning in numbers, but lacking in meaningful analysis” and “we’ve got half a dozen different versions of the truth”?</p>

<p>Social media has changed the rules of publishing. These days any publisher who isn't connecting their readers together is missing out on the biggest driver of traffic and revenue. Involving the audience in the content of a site may still feel like a big leap, but as the web has grown up, the models of publishing have too. In this session Digital's team explore the principles behind effective social networking and ask why most publishers get it wrong. They provide plain spoken commentary about what magazines large and small need to be doing, and look at simple steps for getting started. Senior Associate Consultant Tom Bureau leads this session for us. As the former UK Managing Director of multi award winning CNET Networks, Tom built their range of online magazines, portals and networks based on the power of social networking. As part of this Digital Training Academy, Tom will be taking general questions about social media and Digital's Team will be feeding these into a live online classroom for event participants.</p>

We created this Academy three years ago to help media sales teams sell online advertising as effectively as they'd sold print, radio and television space before. The Academy centres around a packed day of lessons, but it also includes research we're giving you before, and time online afterwards to answer your questions. This website on <a href="http://www.digitaltrainingacademy.com/">DigitalTrainingAcademy.com</a> is the place where we'll be hosting your questions and tutoring notes.</p>

	<h2><a href="http://www.digitaltrainingacademy.com/digitalmediasalesacademy/2007/04/why_did_media_owners_ask_us_to.php">Why did media owners ask us to create the Digital Media Sales Academy?</a></h2>
			<div class="entry-content">
	<p>Publishers told us they needed to raise their ad revenues online. Just think about your business: maybe that's 500k this year, maybe it's double last year's budgets, but you'll be facing a pretty steep goal if you're like most of the firms we work with.</p>

<p>Your teams are probably less familiar with online than print and suddenly it's at the heart of their work rather than a value-add that was bundled to close something in the next print edition. They're selling against some of the most powerful and structured teams in the world, and your market share is probably falling even if your revenues are growing substantially …in fact at the hands of search engines it could be collapsing. Worse than that, the other guys are raising the bar all the time. The migration of classified ads out of print is hurting.</p>

<p>Suddenly sales teams have to get up to speed with the new tools and use them in an intensely competitive market. Their clients may know much more than they do, and certainly some of the digital agencies will have mastered the jargon and the principles. The ad formats, the targeting, the metrics and reporting; it's a world beyond print or broadcast. And that's before you think about the daunting jargon and the impenetrable web of companies in the industry, that's a scary place for a sales person to be. </p>

<p>The Digital Media Sales Academy focuses on giving you the right knowledge to build your understanding and shift your confidence. It's a full day training Academy preceded by pre-course reading and followed by access to a bespoke learning centre for the group. We've even set up a graduate programme that lets us continue supporting them with email news services for six months. </p>

<p>We're the premium training provider in the industry, training thousands of executives across fifteen countries. My passion has always been training and more than 30,000 people have attended my talks and courses. All of us at the Digital training Academy not only hope you enjoy this Academy, but that it changes the way you work. The digital landscape is rich in opportunity and I look forward to seeing you get your fair share of it.</p>

	<h2><a href="http://www.digitaltrainingacademy.com/digitalmediasalesacademy/2007/04/digital_training_academy_and_i.php">Digital Training Academy and its founder</a></h2>

	<p><img title="Dannymeadowsklue" height="108" alt="Dannymeadowsklue" src="http://www.digitaltrainingacademy.com/images/dannymeadowsklue.jpg" width="100" border="0" />Knowledge and training are critical for online marketers. Get it right and the internet becomes the most powerful marketing tool there's ever been, but getting it right is not straight forward. That's why I helped set up the Internet Advertising Bureau in 1997, and why I moved on from being its Chief Executive in 2005 to set up the Digital Training Academy. Thousands of marketers need to learn these new skills, so what the Digital Training Academy does is bring together senior industry figures to help them get there. Our team has been training marketers since 2001, and now through the forty academy courses, we have great ways to get your team on the fast track.</p>
<p>If you'd like some more background about some of the things I've done in the internet marketing and publishing industries then there's <a href="http://www.digitalstrategyconsulting.com/documents/DSC_DMK_consultant_profile.pdf">a biography</a> in our press centre.</p>
