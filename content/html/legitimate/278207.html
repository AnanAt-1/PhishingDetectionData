<P>The following is a brief compendium of what we at Auburn Univeristy
College of Engineering use to secure our NIS networks. We had a mix of
about 65% NIS, 35% NIS+ network before dropping NIS+ due to reliability
problems and setting all machines to use NIS.
The following is our implementation of securing NIS
using various vendor patches and free utilities from around the world.</P>
<P>NIS has a reputation of being extremely insecure. If you implement
these steps it will lose most if not all of the reasons for this, and
you will retain all the administrative advantages of NIS without 
the security risks.  We use NIS on SunOS4 and on Solaris 2.X machines and 
are a
predominantly Sun shop.  All other machines may have slightly different
results and implementations.  Hopefully others will find this useful,
though. Here's a list of reasons why you should follow these steps.</P>
<OL><LI>People can

may have confidential information.

<UL><LI><P><STRONG>Router Modifications</STRONG></P>Most sites have
a router connecting themselves with the outside world. If you have
control of this router make sure you do the following to things, or
everything else below could be completely useless. (Note, implementation
details and configuration is router specific, and we can't help
configure your particular brand of router.)<OL>
<LI>Turn off source routing.</LI>
<LI>Apply a filter that makes sure that packets coming in from the
outside network do not have source IP address that match the inside
network. (IP spoofing) see the following <A HREF="ftp://ciac.llnl.gov/pub/ciac/bulletin/f-fy95/f-08.IP-spoof-hijacked-session" NAME="CIAC IP spoofing attack notice" TITLE="CIAC IP spoofing attack notice"

<LI>If practical install a router filter that blocks ALL RPC packets.
and everything on port 111 (and 2049 if you don't export NFS outside
your LAN(s))</LI></OL><P><STRONG>Replacing Daemons</STRONG></P></LI>
<LI>Wietse Venema has written 2  excellent utilities that are
absolutely essential for securing NIS. They are replacements for the sun
shipped portmap and rpcbind (SunOS4.1.X, Solaris2.X) respectively. 
These tools work much the same way as tcp_wrappers by defining access
lists for hosts that are and are not allowed to access your portmap.
Without these tools in place a remote user can effectively use your own
portmap as a way to circumvent security by accessing your NIS services
through the portmap and appearing to be coming from a machine inside
your domain. Click 
<A HREF="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/netutils/portmap">here</A> 
to download portmap from <A HREF="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub" NAME="COAST FTP site"
>the COAST security archive.</A> Click 
<A HREF="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/rpcbind">
here</A> for rpcbind (Solaris2.X). Both of these require that you
have 
<A HREF="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/netutils/tcp_wrappers"</A>
tcp_wrappers</A>. 
<P><STRONG>Installing Vendor Patches</STRONG></P></LI>
<LI>For SunOS4.1.3_U1B and below get the NIS patch for securenets and
install it on your system.  On SunOS 4.1.3_U1 and U1_B this is patch
101435-03.  On SunOS 4.1.[0-3] this
is patch 100482-08.  In your securenets file you should ONLY have those
domains which require NIS maps. Use the smallest subset of domains
possible. Try to not include subnets with PC's and macs on them if
possible, since these machines have no concept of root; anybody could
get your maps.</LI>
<LI>
For Solaris machines, the securenets capability is integrated into
Solaris 2.6 and more recent as a standard part of the NIS server installation. It
is also a good idea to have the OS specific NIS patches installed if
applicable. For instance, for Solaris2.6, you should have vendor patch 105403 installed. You should <STRONG>not</STRONG> be running a NIS server (ypserv) on
a machine that has an older version of Solaris than 2.6. For more information on
securenets <A
HREF="http://docs.sun.com:80/ab2/coll.47.4/NETNAME/@Ab2PageView/33137?DwebQuery=securenets&Ab2Lang=C&Ab2Enc=iso-8859-1"> see docs.sun.com</A></LI>
<P><STRONG>Restricting Access</STRONG></P>
<P>
<LI>It is a very good idea to make your NIS master machine restricted
access for administrative staff only. This is where all the jewels are
and if it gets compromised it does not good that NIS is protected when
the raw text files are not. It is also a good idea to turn off routed on
this machine and install static routes to all of your local networks
that use NIS service. This way, even if a hacker can bypass your
portmap/securenets security, the information drops on the floor on the
way out of your machine because it doesn't have a way back to the
hackers site.<P><STRONG>Blocking TCP Attacks</STRONG></P></LI>
<LI>TCP sequence number guessing attacks are on the rise. These attacks
rely on the fact the the kernel is not very good at picking random
numbers for TCP sequence numbers. The sequence numbers control the order
of the packets in the TCP/IP stream. If a hacker can guess what sequence
numbers you are using (there are now automated tools to do this) he can
intercept your session. In theory, removing the route to outside
networks should prevent this attack, however, if it does not, or if you
are not able to do this, you may wish to investigate some of the
unsupported patches (for SunOS in particular) that block this kind of
attack by altering the TCP sequence number generation. I've placed a
README containing the rationale and instructions for one such patch <A HREF="ftp://ftp.eng.auburn.edu/pub/doug/fix-sequence-no" TITLE="Preventing TCP Sequence Attacks"
>here</A>. There are patches for Solaris 2.6 to prevent sequence prediction, and 
Solaris7 and above have this feature integrated.

<P><STRONG>Shadow Passwords</STRONG></P></LI>
<LI>Set your machine up to do Shadow Passwords.  (Contrary to popular
belief, this does NOT require the C2 security patch on SunOS4). Shadow passwords
can be enabled by following a few short easy steps. (If you use groups
with passwords, you should do the following steps for the group.adjunct
file as well, except for the AU* stuff)
<OL>

<P> <STRONG> SunOS4 instructions: </STRONG>

<LI>Make backup copies of the passwd maps on the NIS master and on all
client and slave machines. Make a backup copy of the Makefile on your
NIS master too.<br>
</LI>
<LI>In the directory where you keep your NIS maps, make a directory
called security (e.g. /var/yp/security). <CODE><BR>cd /var/yp<BR>mkdir security<BR
>chown root security
<BR>chmod 700 security</CODE><BR></LI>
<LI>Take all of the passwords out of your NIS master passwd map and
place them in a passwd.adjunct map in the security directory. Replace
all the password entries in the password map with entries that have the
username preceeded by two hash marks. Like this:<CODE><BR>root:##root:0:0::/:/bin/csh<BR
></CODE>The format for the shadow password map is then follows the form
of<CODE><BR>username:password:::::<BR></CODE>Where password is what
you removed from the passwd file. The 5 remaining colons will never have
anything in them. They are used by C2 security for mandatory security
accesses, but that is irrelevant here. The following awk script will
generate a passwd.adjunct file.<CODE><BR><BR>nawk -F\: '{printf("%s:%s:::::\n", $1, $2)}' passwd &GT security/passwd.adjunct
<BR><BR></CODE>And the following script will fix your passwd file.<CODE>
<BR><BR>nawk -F\: '{printf("%s:##%s:%s:%s:%s:%s:%s\n", $1, $1, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7)}' passwd &GT passwd.new<BR><BR>
</CODE>Check the file passwd.new for any errors before replacing passwd
with this new file. Now is also the perfect time to check for users that
have no password and replace the emtpy password entry with a "*" in the
passwd.adjunct file.<BR></LI>
<LI>Create an /etc/security directory on every machine. And take the
root password (and any other local passwords) our of your /etc/passwd
file and into /etc/security/passwd.adjunct file (like above)<CODE><BR># mkdir /etc/security<BR
># chmod 700 /etc/security<BR></CODE> Then fill the file with something
like this:
<CODE><BR>root:ZbAirHUqwr9w:::::<BR>
nobody:*:::::<BR>
daemon:*:::::<BR>
sys:*:::::<BR>
bin:*:::::<BR>
audit:*:::::<BR>
sync:*:::::<BR>
AUpwdauthd:*:::::<BR>
AUyppasswdd:*:::::<BR>
+::::::<BR>
</CODE>Obviously, your root password will be taken our of your
/etc/passwd file. The above password is nonsense anyway.  If you want a
different root password for each machine, make sure the root entry above
has a valid password. If you want an identical root password for all
your machines which comes out of NIS, delete the root line above all
together.
<BR></LI>
<LI>Insert the following two lines in your NIS master password map AND
in each machines local /etc/passwd file <CODE><BR>AUpwdauthd:##AUpwdauthd:10:10::/lost+found:/bin/true<BR
>
AUyppasswdd:##AUyppasswdd:11:10::/lost+found:/bin/true
<BR></CODE><P>Lost+found can be replaced with the name of any local
directory.</P><BR></LI>
<LI>Insert the following two lines into your NIS master passwd.adjunct,
and make sure they are contained in every local
/etc/security/passwd.adjunct map as well.<CODE><BR>AUpwdauthd:*:::::<BR>




AUyppasswdd:*:::::
<BR></CODE><BR></LI>
<LI>Make sure your rc.local file has the following set of lines
uncommented.  These provide a way for clients to authenticate a password
as being valid or not without the password being passed over the net in
clear text. The encrypted password is passed to the server for
authentication. 
<PRE>
#
# start up authentication daemon if present and if adjunct file exists
#
if [ -f /usr/etc/rpc.pwdauthd -a -f /etc/security/passwd.adjunct ]; then
        rpc.pwdauthd &          echo -n ' pwdauthd'
fi
</PRE><BR></LI>
<LI>Now you need to make sure that when you update passwords and users
that your Makefile is setup properly to push out the passwd.adjunct map.
 After the all: rule in your Makefile add a new entry, c2secure.  
 Now you need to add a make rule for this entry.
<PRE>c2secure:
        -@if [ -f $(DIR)/security/passwd.adjunct ]; then \
                if [ ! $(NOPUSH) ]; then $(MAKE)  $(MFLAGS) -k \
                passwd.adjunct.time group.adjunct.time; \
                else $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) -k NOPUSH=$(NOPUSH) \
                passwd.adjunct.time group.adjunct.time; \
                fi; \
        fi
</PRE></LI>
<LI>You now need to make sure the rpc.yppasswdd on your NIS master is
running with the right flags.  Below is a sample.  The -noshell and
-nogecos flags specify that users are not allowed to change their shell
or their full name using the passwd command. They are not stricly
necessary for the proper functioning of rpc.yppasswdd. One further note:
the rpc.yppasswdd supplied with 4.1.3_U1B seems to crash, so we use the
one from 4.1.3 instead, and it works fine.
<PRE><BR>
if [ -f /usr/etc/rpc.yppasswdd ]; then
	rpc.yppasswdd /var/yp/dbdir/passwd /var/yp/dbdir/security/passwd.adjunct -nosingle -noshell -nogecos -m passwd.adjunct &gt /dev/console
	echo -n ' yppasswdd'
fi
</PRE><BR></LI>
<LI>Finally, you need to push the maps out. First run make on your
master. It will update the map and attempt to push it out. If you have
slaves it may fail because the slaves don't know about this newly
created map. Use ctrl-c to break the process and either ypxfr the map by
hand or ypinit -s on each of the slaves to reinitialize and synchronize
with the NIS master.<BR></LI>
<LI>Test it out.  If it doesn't work let me know, I may have
inadvertently forgotten a step. In any case, you did follow step 1 and
make backups right?</LI></OL>
<OL>

<P><STRONG>Solaris2 instructions</STRONG><br>
(with corrections contributed by <A href="mailto:rick.parsons@eds.com">Rick
Parsons</a>)</P>

<LI>
Solaris 2 has a standard mechanism for shadowing the local passwd file
(using /etc/shadow) so only the NIS passwd map needs attention. 
For new installs, make sure you have SUNWypr and SUNWypu packages installed. 
See your AnswerBook documentation for NIS installation instructions (on the
docs CD).</LI>
<LI>Make backup copies of the passwd maps on the NIS master and on all
client and slave machines (if not a fresh install). Make a backup copy 
of the Makefile on your
NIS master.<BR></LI>
<LI>
In the directory where you keep your NIS maps, make a directory called
security (e.g. /var/yp/security).
<p>

<pre>
cd /var/yp
mkdir security
chown root security
chmod 700 security
</pre>

<LI>
Take all of the passwords out of your NIS passwd map and stick them in a
passwd.adjunct map in the security directory. Replace all the password
entries in the password map with entries that have the username preceded by
two hash marks. Like this:
<p>
<code>username:##username:2120:2120:Joe User:/:/bin/csh</code>

<p>
The format for the shadow password map is then follows the form of
<p>
<code>username:crypt:::::</code>
<p>
Where crypt is the encrypted password string that you removed from the passwd file. The 5 remaining
colons will never have anything in them. They are used by C2 security for
mandatory security accesses, but that is irrelevant here. The following awk
script will generate a passwd.adjunct file.
<p>
<pre>
nawk -F\: '{printf("%s:%s:::::\n", $1, $2)}' passwd > security/passwd.adjunct
</pre>
<p>
And the following script will fix your passwd file.
<p>
<code>
nawk -F\: '{printf("%s:##%s:%s:%s:%s:%s:%s\n", $1, $1, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7)}'
passwd > passwd.new
</code>
<p>
Check the file passwd.new for any errors before replacing passwd with this
new file. Now is also the perfect time to check for users that have no
password and replace the empty password entry with a "*" in the
passwd.adjunct file. Also, you'll need to adjust your new account add script
to automatically add an entry to the /etc/security/passwd.adjunct file. This
passwd map should NOT contain root or other administrative usernames, these
should be in the local passwd file protected by the standard shadow
mechanism.

</LI>
<LI>
Insert the following two lines in your NIS master password map
<p>
<pre>
AUpwdauthd:##AUpwdauthd:10:10::/var/tmp:/bin/true
AUyppasswdd:##AUyppasswdd:11:10::/var/tmp:/bin/true
</pre>
<p>
/var/tmp can be replaced with the name of any local directory.
</LI>
<LI>
Insert the following two lines into your NIS master passwd.adjunct.
<p>
<code>
AUpwdauthd:*:::::<br>
AUyppasswdd:*::::
</code>

</LI>
<LI>Now you need to make sure that when you update passwords and users that
your Makefile is setup properly to push out the passwd.adjunct map. It may
be there already, but if not, after the all: rule in your Makefile add a new
entry, c2secure.  Now you need to add a make rule for this entry.
<p>
<pre>
c2secure:
    -@if [ -f $(DIR)/security/passwd.adjunct ]; then \
       if [ ! $(NOPUSH) ]; then $(MAKE)  $(MFLAGS) -k \
       passwd.adjunct.time group.adjunct.time; \
       else $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS) -k NOPUSH=$(NOPUSH) \
       passwd.adjunct.time group.adjunct.time; \
       fi; \
    fi
</pre>
</LI>
<LI>
 Stop and restart NIS (use /usr/lib/netsvc/yp/ypstop and ypstart.) This
 will start yppasswd with the correct parameters.
</LI>
<LI>
Finally, you need to push the maps out. First run make on your master. It
will update the map and attempt to push it out. If you have slaves it may
fail because the slaves don't know about this newly created map. Use ctrl-c
to break the process and either ypxfr the map by hand or ypinit -s on each
of the slaves to reinitialize and synchronize with the NIS master.
</LI>
<LI> (If this is a new install, remember to change the <B>nsswitch.conf</B> 
file so that <I>passwd:</I> is set to either <B>compat</B> or <B>files nis</B> 
or whatever your local preferences indicate.</LI>
</OL>
<P><STRONG>TCP Wrappers Addendum</STRONG></P></LI>
<LI>Here are some ways to setup your hosts.allow file when you have
portmap installed. Let's assume you have a class B network with address
129.129, subnetted using mask 255.255.255.0.  Now let's assume your sun
network has 10 subnets.  There are two ways you can setup your
hosts.allow file. You can put all 10 subnets in one at a time like this:<PRE
>portmap: 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0
portmap: 129.129.1.0/255.255.255.0
portmap: 129.129.2.0/255.255.255.0
...
...
portmap: 129.129.10.0/255.255.255.0
</PRE> Note: the first line is not always necessary, but it's safe to
include it. It is necessary on NIS slaves and masters that have to
answer ypbind broadcast requests on the local network. The second
approach is to just put a broad mask for your entire Class B network. 
Sometimes this is easier than doing every single subnet one at a time.
(That would make for a HUGE /etc/hosts.allow file, 1 per machine.
Obviously, this would be impractical. Here's an example of the latter
approach.<PRE>portmap: 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0
portmap: 129.129.0.0/255.255.0.0
</PRE><BR></LI>
<LI>Read the documentation included with tcp_wrappers. It's very useful
stuff.  You can apply lots of options to the above. For example, you
could put a statement up there such that any request from an
unauthorized host would result in a reverse finger being mailed to the
account of your choice plug a syslog entry that could trip an alarm.<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>If you get complaints about 'audit', you'll need to mkdir 
/etc/security/audit on the machines where you run shadow passwords.
<BR><BR></LI>
<LI>Congratulations! You are now immune to most of the security holes
and attacks that been publicized widely and have plagued NIS.<BR></LI></UL>
