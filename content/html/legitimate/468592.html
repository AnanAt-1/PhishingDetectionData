INTRODUCTION 


N  December,  1864,  my  father,  Ebenczer^ 
Blodgctt,  of  Rumney,  N.  H.,  then  near 
his  seventy-eighth  birthday,  was  visiting 
me  at  my  house  in  Boston.  One  even- 
ing the  conversation  turned  u))on  family 
history,  and  I  was  fortunate  enough  to  make  some 
pencil  notes  of  his  statement  relating  chiefly  to  the 
family  in  Hudson,  N.  H.  His  memory  was  almost  per- 
fect in  regard  to  the  great  family  of  thirteen  children, 
reared  by  his  father  Asahel^,  and  he  gave  a  very  clear 
account  of  his  grandfather  Jeremiah^,  and  was  familiar 
with  the  tradition  that  his  great-grandfather  Joseph*, 
left  Chelmsford,  Mass.,  the  original  home,  settled  at  Not- 
tingham West,  now  Hudson,  at  a  period  so  early  that  he 
had  to  live  in  a  garrison  house  for  protection  from  the 
Indians,  and  that  a  son  of  his  was  the  first  white  child 
born  in  the  town.  I  still  retain,  considerably  yellowed 
by  the  lapse  of  more  than  forty  years,  the  notes  of  that 
conversation,  and  later  study  of  documentary  evidence 
and  records  verified  the  substantial  accuracy  of  my 
father's  statement. 


A  Introduction 

About  1893  I  received  from  John  Taggard  Blodgett, 
of  Providence,  R.  I.,  now  my  esteemed  friend  and  cor- 
respondent, and  one  of  the  Honorable  Justices  of  the 
Supreme  Court  of  Rhode  Island,  an  Incomplete  List 
of  Certain  Lines  of  the  Descendants  from  Thomas 
Blogget,  who  sailed  from  London  for  New  England 
in  April,  1635,  in  the  Increase,  and  who  settled  in 
Cambridge,  Mass.  This  "  List,"  compiled  largely  from 
the  Town  Records  of  Chelmsford,  Mass.,  and  Hudson, 
N.  H.,  disclosed  my  descent  from  the  original  Immigrant 
of  1635,  as  well  as  that  of  my  esteemed  informant. 

Prompted  by  this  new  light,  I  prepared  a  condensed 
outline  of  the  lineage  of  myself  and  my  near  kinsmen. 
Judge  Caleb  Blodgett  of  the  Superior  Court  of  Mass- 
achusetts, now  deceased  ;  of  his  brother  Judge  Isaac  N. 
Blodgett,  of  New  Hampshire,  late  Chief  Justice  of  the 
Supreme  Court  of  that  State,  also  now  deceased,  and  of 
Hon.  Rufus  Blodgett,  late  United  States  Senator  from 
New  Jersey,  — which  was  published  in  Munsell's  Ameri- 
can Ancestry  of  1893. 

In  the  Spring  of  1901  I  was  convalescent  after  a  long 
sickness,  and  having  withdrawn  from  business  after  a 
continuous  mercantile  experience  of  more  than  half  a 
century,  was  living  temporarily  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
Boston  Public  Library,  and  began  a  systematic  exam- 
ination of  Town  Histories,  War  Rolls,  Genealogical 
Registers,  Family  Genealogies,  English  Visitations,  Pro- 
bate Records,  etc.  This  I  continued  at  the  library  of 
the  New  England  Historic  Genealogical  Society,  hand- 
ling and  examining  thousands  of  volumes,  and  transcrib- 
ing everything  I  found  bearing  upon  my  subject.  A 
general  correspondence  followed,  which  continues  at  the 


Introduction  5 

present  writing.     The   family  is  much  more  numerous 
and  widely  scattered  than  I  could  anticipate. 

I  have  found  the  name  in  every  State  of  the  Union, 
in  Canada,  in  Mexico,  even  in  far  off  Hawaii.  I  have 
on  hand  more  material  than  I  can  expect  to  arrange 
properly  for  publication  ;  my  aim  is  to  put  in  form  for 
preservation,  as  much  as  possible  of  the  history  of  an 
old  and  honorable  family. 

This  present  little  work  was  projected  only  in  the 
interest  of  my  own  immediate  branch  of  the  general 
family,  and  for  distribution  to  the  descendants  of  my 
grandfather  Asahel^  Blodgett.  An  afterthought  prompts 
me  to  add  in  Part  III,  The  first  four  generations  of 
Blodgetts  in  America,  the  family  of  Daniel^  at  Chelms- 
ford, and  the  family  of  Samuel^  at  Woburn,  Mass.

wife  Susan,  aged  37,  with  two 
young  sons,  Daniel,  aged  four,  and  Samuel,  aged 
one  and  a  half.  The  official  custom-house  record 
of  their  departure  from  London,  according  to 
Drake's  "  Early  Founders  of  New  England," 
Boston,  1865,  and  Hotten's  "  Original  Lists,"

The  official  record  gives  no  suggestion  as  to 
the  English  locality  from  which  the  family  came. 
Thomas  was  evidently  a  Puritan ;  the  Puritan 
emigration  was  chiefly  from  the  eastern  Coun- 
ties, and  as  the  compiler,  after  a  diligent  search 
through  the  great  mass  of  Harleian  Publications, 
Parish  Registers,  Heraldic  Visitations,  Court  Rec- 
ords, etc.,  which  are  available  in  the  great  libra- 
ries, has  only  found  the  name  in  the  Eastern 
Counties  of  Norfolk  and  Suffolk,  it  seems  probable 
that  Thomas,  from  whom,  so  far  as  ascertained, 
all  of  the  name  in  this  country  are  descended, 
was  from  that  part  of  England;  but  no  definite 
information  has  been  found  as  to  the  locality 
from  which  he  came,  or  of  his  ancestry,  and  this 
answers  a  question  frequently  asked  regarding  a 
coat-of-arms.  When  the  daughter  and  heir  of 
Richard  Blodgett,  in  the  County  of  Suffolk,  Gent., 
married  John  Herberd,  of  Yaxley- Yaxley,  1561, 
the  Blodgett  arms  were  quartered  with  those  of 
the  bridegroom,  etc.,  but  we  cannot  connect  our 
ancestor  with  Richard,  or  with  Edward  Blodgett, 


Of  Asahel  Blodgett  ii 

also  mentioned  about  the  same  time.      (See  Visi- 
tations of  Norfolk,  1563,  1589,  1613.) 

Thomas  arrived  in  Boston  in  due  course  and  set- 
tled in  Cambridge  (then  "  New-Towne"),  where 
he  was  one  of  the  original  members  of  "  Rev. 
Thomas  Shepard's  Company,"  which  founded  what 
is  now  the  Shepard  Memorial  Church.  Early  in 
the  year  1636  Mr.  Hooker  and  his  congregation 
at  Newtowne  had  removed  to  Hartford,  Conn. 
In  the  quaint  language  of  the  times  the  organiza- 
tion of  the  church  which  took  their  place  is  thus 
described  : 

Thefe  people  and  Church  of  Chrijl  being  thus  de- 
parted from  Newtowne,  the  godly  people,  who  came  in 
their  roomes,  gathered  the  eleaventh  Church  of  Chrijl, 
and  called  to  the  Office  of  a  Paftor,  that  gratious, 
fweete,  Heavenly  minded,  and  foule-ravifliing  Minifter, 
Mr.  Thomas  Shepheard* 

Thus  on  the  ist  of  February,  1636,  was  formed 
the  first  permanent  church  at  "Newtowne"  (Cam- 
bridge). 

Thomas'  was  allotted  land  March  6,  1636,  and 
made  a  freeman  the  same  year.  A  daughter, 
Susanna,'  was  born  in  June,  1637,  of  whom  more 
below.  A  son,  Thomas,'  whose  birth  is  not  given, 
died  Aug.  7,  1639,  and  his  death  is  the  seventh 
recorded  in  "  Newtowne."

12  The  Blodarett  Ancestors 


&lt;b ' 


Thomas  Blogget,  the  father,  was  apparently  a 
man  of  some  means.  He  conveyed  a  house  and 
land  in  Garden  Street  in  1638,  and  also  an  estate 
in  Dunstan  Street  in  1639.  He  died  in  1642, 
and  his  will,  dated  loth  August,  1641,  was  pro- 
bated in  1643.     I^  w^^  ^"  ^^  following  terms  : 

I,  Thomas  Blogget,  being  at  this  time  in  my  right  mind, 
give  to  my  wife  Susan  my  whole  estate  after  my  decease, 
as  well  within  doors  as  without.  She  to  bring  vp  my 
children  in  such  learning  &amp;  other  things  as  is  Meete  for 
them,  &amp;  pay  oldest  son  Daniel  ^15.  when  one  and 
twenty,  or  in  one  month  after  decease.  To  my  2^  son 
Samuel  £,\^.  as  above.  To  daughter  Susanna  ;£i5. 
Should  they  have  a  father-in-law  who  does  not  treat 
them  well,  my  will  is  that  the  Deacons  &amp;  our  brother 
ffessington  &amp;  our  brother  Edward  Windship,  they,  or 
either  of  them,  should  have  power  to  see  unto  it  and 
reforme  it  by  one  means  or  other.

His  widow  married  Feb.  15,1 644,  James  Thomp- 
son, of  Woburn,  Mass.,  and  the  daughter  Susanna^ 
married  Nov.  28,  1655,  Jonathan  Thompson,  the 
son  of  her  step-father.     She  had  seven  children,

and  her  oldest  son  Jonathan'  Thompson,  born 
Sept.  28,  1663,  was  the  great-grandfather  of  Sir 
Benjamin*^  Thompson,  knighted  by  George  III, — 
the  distinguished  philosopher  better  known  as 
Count  Rumford.  with  which  title  he  was  honored 
by  the  King  of  Bavaria.  He  was  born  at  Woburn, 
March  26,  1753,  and  died  at  Auteuil,  near  Paris, 
Aug.  21,  1 8 14,  in  his  sixty-second  year.  The 
King  of  Bavaria  honored  his  memory  by  a  statue 
at  Munich,  a  replica  of  which  occupies  a  conspicu- 
ous site  in  front  of  the  Public  Library  at  Woburn, 
the  gift  of  Marshall  Tidd  of  that  city. 

From  the  circumstance  of  their  mother's  mar- 
riage it  is  probable  that  the  sons  DanieP  and 
Samuel'  were  brought  up  in  Woburn,  although 
there  are  no  authentic  data  to  confirm  this  proba- 
bility. On  reaching  maturity  Samuel,  the  younger, 
married  and  settled  permanently  at  Woburn,  where 
his  descendants  became  numerous,  and  whence 
went  the  first  of  the  name  to  settle  at  Lexington 
and  thence  to  Brimfield,  Mass.,  to  Stafford,  Conn., 
Randolph,  Vt.,  etc. 

Daniel,^  the  elder  son,  who  more  nearly  con- 
cerns our  present  interest,  went  a  little  further 
north  and  located  in  what  became  the  West  Parish 
of  Chelmsford,  Mass.,  set  off  in  1729  as  the 
town  of  Westford.  The  plantation  of  Chelmsford 
was  granted  May  18,  1653,  and  incorporated  May 
29,  1655.  The  first  petitioners  for  the  grant, 
twenty  in  number,  were  of  Concord  and  Woburn, 


14  The  B  lodge  It  Ancestors 

and  of  these  Daniel  Bloggett  of  VVoburn  was  one. 
He  married  and  settled  there,  and  his  descendants 
became  numerous  and  prominent.  A  grandson. 
Joseph,  was  one  of  the  first  settlers  of  Notting- 
ham West,  now  Hudson,  N.  H. ;  thence  descend- 
ants went  to  Plymouth,  Rumney  and  Dorchester, 
N.  H.  Another  grandson,  Benoni,  was  the  founder 
of  a  numerous  branch  at  Windsor,  Conn.  ;  thence 
they  went  to  Amherst,  Mass.,  etc.  By  the  begin- 
ning of  the  nineteenth  century  the  family  had 
become  numerous  and  widely  scattered. 

They  were  a  patriotic  race.  They  served  in 
the  French  and  Indian  Wars ;  at  the  siege  and 
capture  of  Louisburg  ;  in  the  invasion  of  Canada  ; 
and  the  names  are  preserved  of  more  than  one 
hundred  Revolutionary  soldiers. 

Many  individuals  have  conferred  honor  and 
distinction  on  the  name.  Samuel'  Blodgett  filled 
many  important  offices  in  civil  and  military  life  in 
Massachusetts  and  New  Hampshire.  He  was  a 
friend  and  correspondent  of  Washington ;  was 
called  "  The  Pioneer  of  Progress  ;  "  and  was  best 
known  by  his  great  enterprise  —  for  the  time  — 
of  completing  a  canal  around  Amoskeag  Falls,  at 
Manchester,  N.  H.  His  son,  Samuel,^  Jr.,  served 
on  the  staff  of  Washington,  and  after  the  National 
Capital  was  projected  on  the  banks  of  the  Poto- 
mac, he  was  Chairman  of  the  Commissioners  to 
further  the  project ;  he  built  the  first  house  there  ; 
and  he  furnished  the  first  money  ($io,"ooo),  to-

wards  laying  the  foundations  of  the  Capitol  and 
the  President's  house. 

In  the  eipfhth  ofeneration  there  have  been  a 
United  States  Senator,  a  Judge  of  the  United 
States  District  Court,  a  Chief  Justice  of  the 
Supreme  Court  of  one  New  England  State,  an 
eminent  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court  of  another, 
a  Publicist  and  Statistician  of  national  reputation, 
a  member  of  the  New  York  Chamber  of  Com- 
merce ;  and  in  the  ninth  generation,  a  Judge  ol 
the  Supreme  Court  of  a  third  New  England 
State. 

The  name  has  been  variously  spelt.  Genealog- 
ical records  furnish  not  less  than  twenty-four  va- 
riations, most  of  them,  of  course,  the  offspring  of 
illiteracy ;  one  or  two  branches  have  adopted  a 
fanciful  termination,  perhaps  to  make  plausible 
the  claim  that  it  had  a  Huguenot  origin,  but  there 
is  no  good  ground  for  that;  the  family  came  from 
the  eastern  Counties  of  England.  The  original 
immigrant  wrote  the  name  Blogget,  and  that 
form  prevailed  for  a  century ;  then  Blodget  was 
adopted,  and  about  a  hundred  years  ago,  Blod- 
gett became  the  form  followed  by  most  of  the 
name,  and  it  is  interesting  to  find  from  the  "Visit- 
ations," i.  e.,  the  Heraldic  Records  of  Suffolk  and 
Norfolk,  that  this  was  the  correct,  and  as  far  as 
observed,  the  only  English  spelling,  as  far  back 
as  1561,  long  before  the  immigrant  Thomas  ar- 
rived in  Boston.

Daniel,''  son  of  Thomas'  and  Susan,  born  in 
England,  1631 ;  died  June  28,  1672,  at  Chelmsford, 
Mass.  From  the  history  of  that  town  it  appears 
that  May  19,  1653,  Daniel  Bloggett  was  a  signer 
to  a  petition  "To  the  Hon.  John  Endicott,  with 
others  of  the  Hon.  Magiftrates  and  deputies  at 
the  Hon.  Court  in  Bofton  AHembled,"  for  laying 
out  the  town  of  Chelmsford.  He  appears  to  have 
been  a  prominent  man,  as  his  name  repeatedly 
appears  in  the  early  history  of  the  town.  He 
was  twice  married,  first,  Sept.  15,  1653,  to  Mary, 
daughter  of  Benjamin  Butterfield,  by  whom  he 
had  seven  children,  Thomas,^  Anna,^  Daniel,^  Ben-

so  early  that  he  had  to  live  in  a  "garrison  "  for 
protection  from  Indians.  The  date  of  his  mar- 
riage is  not  known,  but  it  is  probable  that  it  was 
after  the  removal  to  Hudson,  as  in  17 10  he  would 
have  been  but  2 1  years  of  age.  He  married

the  Revolutionary  Army,  and  both  died  in  1776 
of  a  virulent  fever  which  broke  out  in  the  camp 
at  or  near  Ticonderoga,  N.  Y.  Their  father  at 
Hudson,  hearing  of  their  sickness,  started  on 
horseback  to  visit  them,  but  when  he  arrived  at 
the  camp  both  were  dead  and  buried.  The 
father  appears  to  have  carried  home  the  con- 
tagion, as  a  younger  daughter  and  son  died  of 
the  same  fever  in  the  early  months  of  1777. 

Strangely  enough,  the  name  of  Ebenezer 
alone  appears  in  New  Hampshire  Revolutionary 
War  Rolls,  —  a  circumstance  for  which  the 
present  compiler,  who  is  the  grandson  of  their 
brother,  is  unable  to  account  ;  but  the  famil)-

ASAHEL  BLODGETT

^ 


ASAHEL  BLODGETT 


AND 


HIS   DESCENDANTS 


)SAHEL  BLODGETT,  in  the  sixth 
generation  of  the  family  in  Amer- 
ica, was  the  third  son  and  child 
of  Jeremiah^  and  Miriam  (Pro- 
vender) Blodgett.  He  was  born 
in  Nottingham  West,  now  Hud- 
son, N.  H.,June  19,  1755.  The  family  was  one  of 
prominence  and  influence  in  a  community  where 
the  simple  manners  and  rugged  features  of  the 
early  New  England  life  contributed  to  the  devel- 
opment of  sterling  traits  of  character.  The  op- 
portunities for  education  were  very  meagre,  and 
the  brief  terms  of  the  town  schools  seldom  per- 
mitted any  advance  beyond  "  the  three  primary 
R*s."  He  grew  up  on  the  paternal  farm  and 
arrived  at  manhood  in  the  early  part  of  the  Revo- 
lutionary War.     Two  older  brothers  died  in  the 


24  A  sake  I  B  lodge  tt 

service,  as  stated  in  the  preliminary  sketch.     (See 
ante.) 

AsaheP  entered  the  service  in  December,  1776, 
as  appears  by  the  following  record  in  New  Hamp- 
shire War  Rolls,  Vol.  i :  page  438  :  — 

CAPT.  WILLIAM  WALKER's  COMPANY. 

Muster  Roll  of  42  men  raised  out  of  the  fifth  regi- 
ment Militia  in  the  State  of  New  Hampshire  by  an  order 
of  Maj.  Gen.  Folsom,  of  Dec.  7,  1776,  to  rehiforce  the 
Continental  Army  at  New  York  until  the  first  of  March, 
1777. 

This  order  appears  to  have  been  issued  in  ac- 
cordance with  the  following  :  — 


'fc&gt; 


COL.  DAVID  oilman's  REGIMENT,    1 776. 

In  answer  to  a  call  from  Gen.  Washington  the  Legis- 
lature Voted,  Dec.  4,  1776  :  "That  500  men  be  draught- 
ed from  the  several  Regiments  in  the  State  ....  and 
sent  to  New  York.  The  cause  of  this  call  was  that  the 
time  of  service  of  the  troops  in  garrison  at  Fort  George 
and  Ticonderoga  would  expire  the  last  day  of  Dec,  and 
if  their  places  are  not  filled  those  posts  would  fall  into 
the  hands  of  Gen,  Sir  Guy  Carlton."

pears as  follows :

"  He  was  taken  sick  with  a  fever  soon  after  arriving  at 
Fishkill,  N.  Y.,  and  getting  a  fudough  went  to  Danbury, 


A7id  His  Descendants  25 

Conn.,  where  he  remained  until  his  short  term  of  service, 
three  months,  was  out." 

He  does  not  appear  to  have  entered  the  army 
again,  and  as  he  was  the  only  surviving  son  old 
enoiio-h  to  manaofe  affairs  he  remained  at  home 
with  his  parents,  and  for  their  support  received 
the  Homestead  farm.  His  father  Jeremiah,^  died 
in  1796,  aged  75,  and  his  mother,  Miriam  Pro- 
vender, in  May.  1800.  He  built  a  house  on  the 
ancestral  place,  which  his  son  Caleb^  described 
somewhat  as  follows,  to  his  son,  the  late  Judge 
Caleb^  Blodgett  of  Boston,  from  whom  the  present 
writer  received  it. 

The  house  was  a  one-story,  frame  structure,  a 
cellar  under  the  whole.  A  door  in  the  centre  of 
the  front  side  opened  into  an  entry  from  which 
access  was  had  to  the  large  rooms,  one  on  either 
side.  A  huge  chimney  in  the  centre  had  a  fire- 
place in  each  room,  large  enough  to  burn  4-foot 
wood.  There  was  a  brick  oven  at  the  side  of  the 
fireplace  in  the  kitchen  and  living  room.  A  pan- 
try, or  buttery  as  it  was  called,  occupied  the  space 
behind  the  chimney,  opposite  to  the  entr}'  in 
front.  The  cooking  was  done  over  the  open 
wood  fire ;  a  big  crane,  with  swinging  connec- 
tions, was  attached  to  one  side  of  the  fireplace, 
and  from  it  depended  hooks  of  graduated  lengths, 
from  which  hung,  as  occasion  requir(^d,  the  vari- 
ous pots  and  kettles  of  the  kitchen  service.     The 


26  Asahel  B lodge tt 

shovel  and  tongs,  of  ponderous  proportion,  with 
which  the  fire  was  adjusted,  leaned  against  the 
chimney  jamb.  Once  a  week  the  big  oven  was 
heated  and  a  week's  supply  of  bread  and  pies 
baked,  and  the  traditional  pot  of  New  England 
beans  was  seldom  omitted.  The  furniture  and 
furnishings  of  the  house  were  primitive  and  sim- 
ple. A  high,  corded  bedstead  supported  the 
straw  and  feather  bed  in  universal  use.  Linen 
sheets  were  used  in  summer,  while  woolen  sheets 
of  home-made  flannel  were  found  more  agreeable 
for  winter ;  a  heavy  comforter  was  added  for 
warmth,  and  a  patchwork  quilt  covered  the  whole. 
The  tables  and  chairs  were  of  the  plainest  de- 
scription. The  chairs  in  common  use  were  such 
as  may  even  now  be  seen  in  old  country  homes, — 
of  turned  posts,  a  high  straight  back,  the  seat  of 
basket-work,— -  the  whole  very  durable  and  very 
uncomfortable.  The  broom  must  have  mention. 
To  a  stout  handle  hemlock  twigs  of  proper  length 
were  bound  in  successive  layers  by  winding  a  cord 
round  their  stems  until  proper  dimensions  were 
reached,  when  the  cord  was  securely  tied.  A 
broom  made  in  this  way  did  very  good  work  and 
lasted  some  weeks.  Below  the  kitchen  ceiling 
poles  were  suspended,  where  the  housewife  hung 
her  skeins  of  yarn  to  dry,  after  scouring ;  and  in 
the  autumn  the  circlets  of  pumpkins  and  the 
strings  of  quartered  apples  were  hung  to  dry  for 
winter  use. 


And  His  Descendants.  27 

Over  the  lower  rooms  was  an  open  garret, 
broken  only  by  the  great  chimney  ;  here  the  older 
children  slept,  and  here  the  corn  was  spread  to 
dry  in  the  fall. 

The  roof  of  the  house  was  shingled,  but  the 
outside  walls  were  simply  feather-edged  boards 
nailed  to  the  frame.  It  was  not  clap-boarded  on 
the  outside,  nor  was  it  lathed  and  plastered  on 
the  inside ;  so  that  only  an  inch  of  pine  board 
protected  the  inmates  from  the  rigor  of  a  New 
Encrland  winter.  And  this  was  one  of  the  best 
houses  in  the  town.  It  illustrates  the  manner  of 
life  among  New  England  farmers  three  genera- 
tions ago. 

In  1805  Asahel  sold  his  farm  at  Hudson  and 
bought  one  at  Dorchester,  whither  he  removed  in 
the  spring  of  1806.  For  the  motives  and  results 
of  this  removal  see  the  statement  of  his  son  Caleb,=' 
Appendix  A. 

The  present  compiler  visited  Hudson  in  the 
autumn  of  1902,  and  could  not  help  wondering 
how  his  grandfather  left  so  beautiful  a  town  to 
settle  at  Dorchester.  The  site  of  the  garrison 
house  which  the  first  ancestor  in  Hudson  erected 
was  visited.  Since  that  visit  this  site  has,  through 
the  public  spirit  of  Kimball  Webster,  Esq.,  the 
historian  and  antiquarian  of  Hudson,  been  appro- 
priately marked  by  a  boulder  bearing  a  bronze 
tablet,  inscribed  :

The  compiler  also  visited  the  ancient  "  Blod- 
gett Cemetery,"  where  many  of  the  name  are  in- 
terred. A  white  marble  slab  of  modern  design 
marks  the  graves  of  these  immediate  relatives, 
and  is  inscribed  as  follows :

In  these  days  of  strenuous  modern  life,  in  the 
marvelous  development  of  material  forces,  when 
the  express  train  carries  the  traveler  as  many 
miles  in  an  hour  as  he  could  accomplish  in  a  day's 


And  His  Descendants.  29 

travel  in  the  olden  time ;  when  the  movvinq^  ma- 
chine in  the  field  and  the  sewing  machine  in  the 
house  have  so  greatly  reduced  the  ordinary  labors 
of  a  rural  community,  it  is  interesting  and  sugges- 
tive to  recall  the  conditions  and  environments  in 
which  our  ancestors  lived  in  Hudson  and  Dor- 
chester a  hundred  years  ago. 

In  1800,  when  the  Union  comprised  17  States, 
with  a  population  of  5,300,000,  there  were  but 
five  steam  engines  in  the  United  States,  and  their 
joint  capacity  would  not  equal  the  power  that 
propels  an  Atlantic  liner  at  the  present  day. 
Steamboats  had  not  passed  beyond  the  experi- 
mental stage  ;  there  was  not  a  mile  of  railroad 
nor  a  locomotive  in  existence.  It  was  a  good 
day's  travel  from  Hudson  to  Boston  ;  it  was  four 
days  from  Boston  to  New  York,  It  was  nearly 
half  a  century  before  the  telegraph  annihilated 
distance,  and  three  quarters  of  a  century  before 
the  telephone  enabled  the  resident  of  Hutison  to 
hold  conversation  with  a  distant  friend.  Life  at 
that  remote  period  would  seem  monotonous  and 
dull  even  to  the  resident  of  the  country  town  at 
the  present  day.  Now  the  thrifty  farmer  of  Hud- 
son receives,  by  rural  delivery,  the  daily  city 
papers  which  keep  him  in  touch  with  all  the  hap- 
penings of  the  world.  He  lives  in  a  house  with 
comforts  and  conveniences  that  the  city  aristocrat 
did  not  have  a  hundred  years  ago.  His  wife  has 
a    sewing    machine    which    greatly    lightens    her 


30  Asahel  Blodgett 

labor.  His  daughters,  perhaps,  have  a  piano  in 
the  parlor,  and  magazines  and  fashion  plates  on 
their  tables.  When  he  rides  abroad  he  enjoys 
a  top  buggy  and  a  silver-plated  harness. 

The  century  which  has  elapsed  since  the  time 
we  are  considering  has  been  emphatically  the  age 
of  mechanical  invention.  The  wonderful  devel- 
opment of  machinery  has  changed  the  whole 
course  of  industrial  effort,  and  in  many  instances, 
enabled  one  man  to  do  the  work  of  ten  under 
the  old  methods  of  hand  labor.  In  1800  cut 
nails  had  not  been  invented ;  a  wrought  nail, 
made  by  hand,  could  only  be  used  by  first  boring 
a  hole  with  a  gimlet  in  which  to  drive  it.  A 
carpenter  was  an  artisan  ;  he  must  be  able  to 
"  lay  out"  and  plan  the  frame  of  a  building  which 
involved  considerable  mechanical  skill ;  he  must 
also  be  able  to  make  a  paneled  door  and  even  the 
window  sashes,  —  work  now  wholly  done  by  ma- 
chinery in  large  establishments. 

Under  similar  conditions  the  blacksmith  re- 
ceived his  iron  in  large,  solid  bars,  which  he  split 
and  laboriously  forged  into  such  forms  as  he 
required.  Every  little  bolt,  and  even  the  nails 
which  fastened  the  shoe  to  the  hoof  of  the  horse 
or  the  ox,  were  made  by  hand,  one  at  a  time. 
And  so  through  the  whole  range  of  the  mechanic 
arts,  as  far  as  there  were  any  mechanic  arts.

the  old  farms  until  a  period  within  the  memory 
of  the  present  compiler,  who  has  vivid  recollec- 
tions of  their  weight  and  clumsiness. 

It  has  already  been  shown  what  a  farmer's 
house  was  in  1800.  It  was  a  winter's  work  to 
cut  and  haul  wood  for  a  year's  supply.  Oxen 
were  exclusively  used  for  farm  work.  All  farming 
implements  were  heavy  and  clumsy  ;  hay  was  cut 
with  the  scythe,  and  rye  and  oats  with  the  sickle, 
and  threshed  with  the  flail. 

But  if  the  man's  work  was  hard,  the  woman's 
was  more  exacting.  Beyond  the  daily  routine 
of  household  cares  which  never  end,  there  was 
the  dairy  work,  now  commonly  delegated  to  the 
"creameries;"  but  the  clothing  for  the  family, 
however  numerous,  was  a  heavier  burden.  The 
farm  furnished  flax  for  summer  and  wool  for  win- 
ter use,  and  it  was  the  feminine  province  of  wife 
and  grown-up  daughters,  if  there  were  such  — 
sometimes,  of  necessity,  reinforced  by  neighbors' 
daughters  —  to  card  and  spin  and  weave  the  cloth 
with  which  the  family  were  to  be  clothed.  The 
woolen  fabrics  were  sometimes  dyed  at  home  and 
sometimes  sent  to  the  fulling-mill  to  be  dyed, 
scoured  and  finished.  The  garments  were,  of 
necessity,  made  by  hand  ;  there  were  no  sewing 
machines  in  those  days  of  primitive  methods. 
The  women  made  their  own  a-arments  and  the 
men's  every-day  clothes,  but  in  the  case  of  the 
man's  Sunday  suit,  assistance  was  had  from  the 


32  Asahel  Blodgett 

professional  tailoress,  who  came  with  her  shears 
and  press-board  and  goose.  It  was  before  the 
days  of  "  shoddy,"  and  the  home-made  woolen 
fabrics  were  always  substantial  and  sometimes 
handsome. 

The  writer  plainly  remembers  his  father's  wed- 
ding '*  surtout,"  with  graduated  capes,  which  re- 
mained in  evidence  until  the  boy  was  well  grown  ; 
it  was  made  from  cloth  spun,  woven  and  dyed  by 
the  father's  sisters  so  late  as  1825.  The  fabric 
would  be  creditable  to  a  modern  woolen  mill, 
though  the  garment  would  be  thought  peculiar 
and  picturesque. 

Specimens  of  home-made  table  linen  are  still 
prized  by  the  granddaughters  &amp;,nd  great-grand- 
daughters of  that  period,  which  were  creditable 
alike  in  design  and  execution.  Shoes  for  both 
sexes  were  usually  made  in  the  homes  by  the 
itinerant  shoe-maker,  who  came,  as  occasion  re- 
quired, to  make  shoes  for  the  family. 

The  average  farmer's  family,  a  hundred  years 
ago,  was  very  frugal ;  they  produced  nearly  every- 
thing they  consumed.  The  staple  articles  of  food 
were  brown  bread,  —  that  is,  of  corn  and  rye 
mixed,  —  beans,  peas,  potatoes,  and  a  moderate 
amount  of  meat,  mostly  salted.  Tea  and  coffee 
were  not  used  to  any  considerable  extent ;  roasted 
peas  and  crust  coffee  were  frequently  used  in- 
stead. Their  maple  orchards  furnished  sugar. 
Cider  was  a  home  product  and  universally  used. 


And  His  Descendants  33 

A  man's  standing  in  the  community  was  not  im- 
paired by  the  moderate  use  of  New  England  rum. 
The  family  also  had  to  buy  salt,  a  few  spices,  per- 
haps a  little  calico  and  coarse  cotton  cloth,  and 
not  much  else.  The  opportunities  for  mental  im- 
provement or  recreation  were  limited.  They  went 
to  meeting  on  Sunday,  as  a  matter  of  course,  and 
heard  two  sermons,  usually  of  a  doctrinal  char- 
acter ;  during  the  noon  hour  the  men  gathered  in 
groups  outside  the  meeting-house  and  discussed 
the  weather,  the  crops  and  politics  ;  while  inside, 
the  women  talked  of  matters  of  more  interest  to 
the  feminine  mind. 

Of  books  they  possessed  very  few ;  the  Bible, 
of  course  ;  very  likely  the  "  Pilgrim's  Progress," 
and  probably  Fox's  "  Book  of  Martyrs,"  and 
Josephus's  "War  of  the  Jews."  The  "  Farmers' 
Almanac  "  always  hung  in  a  conspicuous  position 
and  was  consulted  with  great  regularity.  The 
weekly  newspaper  of  moderate  size  was  just 
coming  in,  but  at  the  period  we  are  considering 
had  not  attained  great  circulation  or  influence ; 
but  what  these  people  read  they  remembered  ; 
they  had  ample  time  for  reflection,  and  were  men 
of  decided  convictions  and  of  earnest  purposes. 
If  lacking  in  worldly  wisdom  and  the  refinements 
of  society,  they  developed  those  hardy  and  rugged 
traits  of  character  common  to  the  inhabitants  of 
New  England  while  they  remained  a  homogeneous 
people,  and  which  exercised  so  potent  an  influ- 


34  Asahel  Blodgett 

ence  in  moulding  our  institutions  in  the  first  half 
century  after  the  adoption  of  the  Federal  Consti- 
tution. 

Such  were  the  people  among  whom  Asahel 
Blodgett  dwelt,  and  such  the  environment  in 
which  his  large  family  of  eight  sons  and  five 
daughters  were  reared,  ten  of  whom  lived  to  at- 
tain an  average,  within  a  fraction,  of  four-score 
years,  and  three  died  under  thirty. 

He  married,  first,  Dec.  13,  1781,  Catherine, 
daughter  of  Ebenezer  and  Abigail  Pollard,  born 
June  12,  1 76 1.     Their  children  were:

All  except  Betsey  were  born  in  Hudson  ;  she 
was  born  after  his  removal  to  Dorchester.  He 
died  at  Dorchester,  June  2,  1842,  and  was  buried 
in  "  Blodgett  Cemetery,"  about  one  mile  north- 
west from  the  Town  House. 

Of  the  character  of  the  subject  of  this  sketch, 
one  of  his  grandsons,  Hon.  Rufus  Blodgett,  of 
New  Jersey,  writes  :  — 

I  remember  our  grandfather  quite  distinctly,  though  I 
was  but  eight  years  old  at  the  time  of  his  death.  As  I 
recall  him  he  was  a  man  of  stern  nature,  very  firm  convic- 


36  Asahel  Blodgett 

tions,  and,  so  far  as  I  have  been  able  to  judge,  of  strict 
integrity.  It  is  possible  he  possessed  more  native  talent 
than  any  of  his  descendants,  ....  but  they,  both  male 
and  female,  were  a  strong  people  intellectually,  though 
they  lacked  early  education  and  business  training 


ig- 


The  compiler  of  these  pages,  when  eight  years 
old,  made  a  winter  trip  of  two  hundred  miles  in 
an  open  sleigh,  with  his  father,  to  visit  the  grand- 
father, then  eighty-one  years  of  age,  and  vividly 
recalls  his  patriarchal  appearance  as  he  sat  before 
the  great  open  fire,  with  a  red  flannel  cap  on  his 
head.  To  the  statement  that  he  was  an  austere 
man  the  writer  can  readily  agree,  for  he  remem- 
bers but  one  remark  addressed  to  him  during  the 
visit  of  two  or  three  weeks :  "So  you  have  come 
to  see  Grandsir,  have  you  ? "  Not  all  grandfathers 
in  these  days  are  so  undemonstrative.  But  his 
children  always  regarded  him  with  affectionate 
respect ;  they  addressed  him,  and  spoke  of  him 
to  each  other,  as  "  Sir." 

In  personal  appearance,  and  perhaps  in  mental 
traits  as  well,  his  first  two  sons  most  resembled 
him.  That  he  was  a  man  of  marked  natural 
abilities  can  hardly  admit  of  question,  for  among 
his  children  were  several  of  strong  character,  who, 
under  more  favorable  conditions  as  to  education 
and  environment,  would  have  been  eminent.  As 
it  was,  it  may  be  fairly  said  that  in  both  Hudson 
and  Dorchester  no  family  was  more  prominent 
and  influential. 


FAMILY   OF  ASAHEL. 


SAHEL^  son  of  AsaheP  and  Catherine 
(Pollard)  Blodgett,  born  in  Hudson, 
N.  H.,  May  15,  1784;  died  in  Dor- 
chester, N.  H,,  April  II,  1863.  He 
was  a  farmer;  married,  about  1804, 
Polly,  daughter  of  Phineas  and  Martha  (Hamblet) 
Blodeett,  born  in  Hudson,  Dec.  20,  1781  ;  died 
Nov.  17,  1862.  He  removed  to  Dorchester  about 
1806,  and  resided  there  until  his  death.  He  was 
a  man  of  strong  individuality,  as  liberally  en- 
dowed by  nature,  perhaps,  as  any  member  of  his 
father's  family,  but  circumstances  and  environ- 
ment were  unfavorable  to  the  development  of 
his  natural  abilities,  and  most  of  his  life  was 
spent  in  the  profitless  labor  of  clearing  up  and 
bringing  into  cultivation  a  large  farm  in  one  of 
the  poorest  towns  of  his  native  State.  It  is  a 
curious  fact,  illustrating  the  decadence  of  farm 
property  in  the  hill  towns  of  New  Hampshire, 
that  his  farm,  consisting  of  about  three  hundred 
acres,  including  an  ample  wood  lot,  a  sugar  or-

chard,  and  a  considerable  amount  of  standing 
timber ;  the  arable  portion  well  cleared  of  stones 
and  enclosed  by  stone  walls  ;  a  well-constructed 
farm-house  in  good  repair,  painted  outside  and 
inside,  supplied  with  flowing  water  from  a  spring 
on  the  hillside ;  a  good  wood-shed  and  piggery ; 
a  barn  large  enough  to  hold  fifty  tons  of  hay  and 
to  house  a  dozen  cattle,  were  all  sold  by  his 
grandson  in  1890  for  one  thousand  dollars, —  a 
sum  which  would  not  replace  the  house  alone. 
His  descendants  were : 

I.  Elias,^  born  in  Hudson,  Aug.  9,  1805.  A  farmer. 
He  married  June  8,  1830,  Melinda,  daughter  of

in  Dorchester,  and  died  there  Aug.  6,  185 1. 
His  widow  married  Wolcott  Dana,  of  Went- 
worth,  and  died  in  that  town,  Feb.  23,  1905. 
His  children,  born  in  Dorchester,  were : 

i.  Mary  Elizabeth,^  born  Oct.  30,  1835 ;  married

ton Institution.  He  became  one  of  the  most 
useful  and  prominent  citizens  of  his  native  town. 
For  a  period  of  thirty  years  he  filled  success- 
ively about  every  office  in  the  gift  of  his  fellow 
townsmen.  He  was  a  representative  to  the 
State  Legislature  in  1854-5  ;  selectman,  18 50-1 :

FAMILY  OF  EBENEZER/ 


BENEZER/  son  of  Asahel''  and  Cath- 
erine (Pollard)  Blodf^ett,  was  born 
in  Hudson,  N.  H.  (then  Nottingham 
West),  Jan.  14,  1786.  He  removed 
with  his  father's  family  in  March, 
1806,  to  Dorchester,  N.  H.,  where  he  co-operated 
with  his  father  and  brothers  in  clearing  off  the 
forest  and  bringing  into  cultivation  a  large  farm, 
which  proved  of  sterile  soil,  in  one  of  the  poorest 
townships  of  the  State.  For  a  few  years  after  the 
clearing  up  of  the  land  good  crops  of  corn,  pota- 
toes and  rye  were  obtained,  but  after  the  stimu- 
lating effect  of  the  ashes  had  ceased,  it  was  found 
cold  and  unproductive.  Like  many  other  young 
men  in  those  days,  after  coming  of  age,  he  went 
"  down  country "  and  for  a  time  worked  in  and 
about  Boston  ;  but  his  home  was  in  Dorchester, 
and  here  he  married,  June  21,  1827,  Sally  Cheever, 
born  in  Danvers,  Mass.,  Nov.  29,  1800.  She  was 
the  daughter  of  Nathan  and  Mehitable   (Porter) 


42  Asahel  Blodgett 

Cheever,  and,  through  her  father,  directly  de- 
scended from  Ezekiel  Cheever,  "  the  celebrated 
schoolmaster"  of  Boston,  and,  through  her  mother, 
from  the  Porter  family  of  Essex  County. 

In  conjunction  with  his  brother  Caleb,  he  built 
a  house  near  his  father's,  and  about  half  a  mile 
north  of  the  present  town  house  in  Dorchester ; 
the  house  was  burned  several  years  since.  His 
residence  there  was  brief,  however.  Business 
reverses  impelled  him  to  seek  a  new  home,  and 
after  some  wandering  he  settled  at  Fort  Coving- 
ton, Franklin  County,  New  York,  then  a  com- 
paratively new  country.  Thither  his  wife  went  to 
join  him  in  the  winter  of  1829-30,  a  distance  of 
two  hundred  miles,  travelling  in  an  open  sleigh 
in  the  rigors  of  a  northern  winter,  and  carrying 
her  infant  son,  then  about  twenty  months  old ;  a 
daughter  was  born  to  them  in  1831.  He  con- 
tinued to  reside  at  Fort  Covington  until  1845, 
following  his  occupation  as  farmer.  For  a  time 
he  was  town  constable,  and  one  year  collector  of 
taxes. 

In  1845  family  ties  and  influences  drew  him 
back  to  New  Hampshire,  and  he  lived,  1845  to 
1847,  i"  Dorchester,  and  from  1848  to  1870  in 
Rumney,  where  he  died,  March  19  of  the  latter 
year,  aged  84  years,  2  months,  5  days.  His  wife 
died  Nov.  23,  1886,  lacking  but  six  days  of  com- 
pleting eighty-six  years,  at  New  Hampton,  N.  H., 
where  she  spent  the  last  years  of  her  life,  a  mem- 


And  His  Descendants  43 

ber  of   her    daughter's    family.     The  remains   of 
both  repose  in  the  village  cemetery  at  Rumney. 

It  may  be  permitted  to  filial  affection  to  record 
in  this  brief  memorial  a  few  words  of  ^rateful 
tribute  to  the  memory  of  beloved  parents. 

The  father  had  no  opportunities  for  early  edu- 
cation   beyond    those    afforded    by  a   few  weeks 
annually   in    the    district   school  in  a  small  New 
England  town  at  the  end  of  the  eighteenth  cen- 
tury ;  but  his  family  was  a  prominent  one  in  the 
town  of  his  birth,  as  well  as  that  where  his  early 
manhood  was  passed,  and  he  had  the  advantage 
of  a  pious  ancestry  and  healthy  family  influences. 
In  early  life  he  became  a  professed  Christian,  and 
in  May,  181 1,  he  was  baptized  by  the  Rev.  Mr. 
Bridgeman   and   united  with  the  Baptist  Church 
in  Canaan,  a  town   adjoining  Dorchester,  where 
he   resided.     On    the    formation    of  a  church  in 
Dorchester  he  became  a  member  of  it,  and  was 
made  a  deacon  in  18 19.     Through  all  his  subse- 
quent   life   his  religion    was    his    inspiration  and 
guide  and  solace.     Orthodox,  Calvinistic,  and  lit- 
eral in  his  understanding  of  the  written  Word,  as 
befitted  the  times,  and  rigid  in  his  construction  of 
Scripture,  he  was  naturally  charitable  and  tolerant 
in  his  judgment  of  others,  and  never  indulged  in 
invective  towards  those  of  a  different  faith.     In 
his  old  age  he  ripened  and  mellowed  in  his  relig- 
ious views,  so  that  he  came  to  regard  those  who 
differed  from  him  with  a  degree  of  tolerance  that 


44  Asahel  Blodgett 

was  hardly  consistent  with  his  earHer  views.  He 
was  a  careful  student  of  the  Bible  and  of  religious 
literature,  especially  that  relating  to  his  own  de- 
nomination, so  that  he  became  a  power  in  the 
church  to  which  he  belonged,  and,  in  a  sense,  a 
theologian  to  whom  even  clergymen  came  for 
information  and  counsel.  Duty  was  his  watch- 
word. Until  the  infirmities  of  age  prevented,  he 
was  a  constant  attendant  on  the  public  worship 
of  the  Sabbath ;  and  after  he  had  passed  the 
"three  score  and  ten"  years  of  the  Psalmist,  he 
frequently  walked  four  miles  to  and  from  the 
third  service,  and  it  was  seldom  that  he  did  not 
take  an  active  part  in  the  prayer-meeting,  speak- 
ing from  a  warm  heart  and  ripe  experience.  He 
was  for  many  years  the  senior  deacon  of  the 
Baptist  Church  in  Rumney.  Always  in  straitened 
circumstances  as  to  this  world's  goods,  he  was 
rich  in  the  respect  of  his  neighbors  and  the  affec- 
tion of  his  family. 

The  mother  was  more  favored  as  to  early  edu- 
cation, and  had  a  natural  facility  for  acquiring 
knowledge,  and  a  retentive  memory  which  treas- 
ured it.  In  early  life  she  was  a  school  teacher. 
She  had  a  natural  fondness  for  literature  and 
great  facility  of  expression.  Some  papers  are 
still  extant,  chiefly  written  in  connection  with 
church  work,  which  show  considerable  literary 
ability ;  but  after  her  marriage,  the  life  of  a  plain 
farmer's  wife  gave  little  opportunity  for  the  exer- 


And  His  Descendants  45 

cise  of  that  talent  beyond  that  which  famiHar  and 
family  correspondence  permitted.  Her  letters 
were  models  in  their  way,  seldom  equalled  in 
these  days  of  hurried  and  careless  writing. 

Soon  after  her  marriage  she  made  a  public 
profession  of  religion  and  united  with  the  Con- 
gregational Church  in  Dorchester,  being  baptized, 
by  immersion,  by  the  pastor,  the  Rev.  Increase  S. 
Davis.  At  Fort  Covington,  and  in  all  her  sub- 
sequent life,  she  and  her  husband  were  members 
of  the  Baptist  denomination.  Deeply  religious  in 
all  her  instincts,  a  naturally  cheerful  and  charita- 
ble temperament  made  her  a  model  wife  and 
mother,  discreet,  gentle,  patient  and  affectionate. 
She  lived  until  within  a  few  days  of  her  eighty- 
sixth  birthday ;  and  although  the  last  years  were 
marked  by  physical  infirmities  and  weakness,  her 
mind  remained  clear  and  her  mental  force  un-^ 
abated.  She  quietly  passed  away,  leaving  to  her 
children  and  children's  children  and  friends  a  fra- 
grant memory  and  a  bright  example  of  Christian 
character. 

They  were  kind  and  indulgent,  yet  discreet, 
parents.  They  recognized  the  importance  of 
education,  and  made  sacrifices  to  give  their  chil- 
dren the  best  that  their  limited  means  and  oppor- 
tunities permitted ;  and  the  modest  monument 
which  marks  their  resting-place  in  the  village 
cemetery  at  Rumney  bears  this  inscription  :  —

Their  children  : 

I.  Isaac  Dimond,^  born  in  Dorchester,  N.  H.,  May 
II,  1828.  Merchant,  of  Boston  and  New  York. 
When  he  was  less  than  two  years  old  his  parents 
removed  to  Fort  Covington,  Franklin  County, 
N.  Y.,  and  there  his  school  days  were  passed. 
In  addition  to  the  opportunities  afforded  by  the 
common  district  school,  he  enjoyed  several  terms 
at  the  Fort  Covington  Academy,  beginning  when 
he  was  nine  years  old,  and  remaining,  intermit- 
tently, until  he  was  fifteen,  amounting  in  all  to 
perhaps  two  years'  attendance.  In  1 844,  when 
he  was  sixteen,  his  family  returned  to  New 
Hampshire.  The  season  of  1845  he  assisted 
his  father  in  carrying  on  a  large  and  sterile 
farm  in  Dorchester.  The  following  winter,  when 
he  was  in  his  eighteenth  year,  he  taught  two 
district  schools,  and  "boarded  round,"  in  the 
adjoining  town  of  Groton,  with  such  success 
that  he  was  invited  to  take  both  schools  again 


And  His  Descendants  47 

the  following  year  ;  but  on  May  6,  1 846,  he  be- 
gan his  mercantile  experience  in  a  country  store 
at  Wentworth,  N.  H.,  where  he  remained  nearly 
four  years.  In  1850  and  part  of  185 1  he  was 
clerk  in  a  dry-goods  store  at  Salmon  Falls  and 
Great  Falls,  N.  H.  In  October,  185 1,  he  went 
to  Boston,  Mass.,  and  entered  a  wholesale  dry- 
goods  house  as  salesman,  in  which  relation  he 
continued  several  years.  In  1861  the  firm  of 
Sweetser,  Swan  &amp;  Blodgett  was  formed,  and 
from  that  date,  for  twenty-three  years,  he  was 
in  business  in  Boston  in  various  connections. 
In  this  period  occurred  two  panics  and  the  great 
fire  of  1872,  entailing  great  loss,  but  not  pre- 
venting him  from  meeting  his  obligations  in 
full.  In  1884  he  removed  to  New  York,  and 
became  connected  with  large  mercantile  inter- 
ests which  continued  fourteen  years.  Upon 
reaching  his  seventieth  year,  and  after  fifty-one 
years  of  arduous  mercantile  experience,  he  re- 
tired from  active  business,  and,  drawn  by  family 
ties,  returned  to  the  vicinity  of  Boston. 

It  may  be  briefly  noted  that  he  was  one  of 
the  original  members  of  the  Boston  Young  Men's 
Christian  Association  at  its  formation  in  1852. 
He  was  an  original  member  of  the  Merchants' 
Association,  and  served  on  leading  committees. 

In  New  York  he  was  a  member  of  the  New 
York  Chamber  of  Commerce,  a  relation  which 
he  continued  after  his  return  to  Massachusetts  ; 
a  member  of  the  New  England  Society,  of  the 
Republican  Club,  and  of  the  Metropolitan  Mu- 
seum of  Art.

After  the  sheets  of  this  little  work  were  printed,  but

called  to  meet  the  most  grievous  sorrow  of  my  life  in  the 
unexpected  death  of  a  dear  son,  and  as  this  Lineage  is  in-

CHARLES   WILLIAM    BLODGETT. 


HARLES  WILLIAM9  BLODGETT  was 
born  in  Boston,  September  14,  1856,  the 
son  of  Isaac  D.^  and  Mary  L.  (Went- 
worth)  Blodgett,  inheriting  through  both 
parents  the  traditions  and  characteristics 
of  the  early  settlers  of  New  England,  as  well  as  what- 
ever of  honor  or  prestige  attaches  to  Revolutionary  ser- 
vice. 

His  childhood  was  uneventful,  though  his  ardent  tem- 
perament and  natural  flow  of  spirits  made  him  an  active 
participant  in  all  boyish  sports.  His  summer  vacations 
were  always  spent  at  his  grandfather's  farm  in  New 
Hampshire,  where  he  imbibed  that  love  of  country  life 
which  impelled  him  in  later  years,  for  many  successive 
seasons,  to  go  to  the  woods  and  lakes  of  Maine  for  his 
annual  vacations.     He  was  an  apt  scholar: — when  eight 


49^5  Iti  Memoriam 

years  old  he  accompanied  his  father  to  church  one  even- 
ing, and  from  the  tablets  on  the  wall  committed  to  mem- 
ory the  Ten  Commandments,  which  he  repeated  correctly 
after  returning  home.  In  recognition  of  this  he  re- 
ceived from  his  father  a  handsome  Bible,  appropriately 
marked.  Many  years  later  that  Bible,  packed  in  a  trunk 
with  other  personal  effects,  was  subjected  to  the  ordeal 
of  fire  in  the  loft  of  his  store,  and  the  father,  who  ac- 
companied him  in  the  examination  of  the  trunk,  recalls 
his  expressions  of  pleasure  when  he  found  the  Bible  had 
been  spared,  although  the  binding  was  considerably  in- 
jured by  the  heat. 

At  fourteen  he  graduated  from  the  Dwight  Grammar 
School,  at  the  head  of  his  class ;  a  few  months  before 
his  eighteenth  birthday,  he  graduated  from  the  English 
High  School,  again  as  "Number  One,"  which  place  he 
had  maintained,  without  a  lapse,  for  the  two  years  pre- 
ceding. 

In  1875  he  began  his  business  education  with  his 
father's  firm,  Blodgett,  Hidden  &amp;  Swan,  and  continued 
with  that  firm  and  its  successors  until  its  dissolution  in 
December,  1883.  A  new  firm  was  organized  January  i, 
1884,  in  which  he  was  a  partner.  His  application  to 
business  was  so  intense  that  his  health  gave  way,  and  in 
1886  he  made  a  brief  trip  to  Europe  for  rest  and  recre- 
ation, and  after  his  return  was  compelled  to  take  a  long 
vacation ;  but  he  never  entirely  recovered  his  former 
buoyancy  and  vigor  ;  tired  nerves  and  headaches  com- 
pelled him  to  take  liberal  vacations. 

In  189  s  a  reorganization  of  the  business  brought  him 
to  the  head  of  the  firm  of  Blodgett,  Ordway  &amp;  Webber, 


Charles    William  Blodgett.  4gc 

and  in  the  eleven  years  that  succeeded,  his  ability  and 
application  were  clearly  shown  in  the  success  that  fol- 
lowed, although  he  found  it  necessary  to  take  an  annual 
summer  rest  of  several  weeks,  which  he  usually  spent 
in  the  woods  of  Maine,  away  from  the  haunts  of  men 
and  the  constraints  of  society. 

At  the  beginning  of  1906  some  premonitory  symp- 
toms of  the  dread  disease  which  was  to  terminate  his 
life  so  soon,  added  to  the  nervous  fatigue,  made  a  vaca- 
tion imperative,  and  guided  by  the  best  medical  advice 
of  Boston  and  New  York,  he,  with  his  family,  went  to 
Southern  California,  in  the  hope  that  freedom  from  care, 
and  the  open-air  life  of  a  warm  climate,  would  bring  im- 
provement. But  this  hope  was  not  to  be  realized ;  he 
enjoyed  the  scenery,  the  flowers  and  the  foliage  of  that 
sunny  land,  but  no  real  improvement  was  observed. 
About  the  first  of  May,  a  few  days  before  he  was  to 
start  homeward,  he  caught  a  severe  cold,  which  seemed 
to  precipitate  and  develop  the  disease  lurking  in  his 
system,  and  brought  on  immediate  and  severe  prostra- 
tion and  suffering.  He  made  a  forced  journey  across 
the  continent  under  most  distressing  conditions,  reach- 
ing his  home  May  13th,  just  three  months  from  the 
date  of  his  departure,  and  took  his  bed  from  which  he 
was  not  again  to  arise ;  but  neither  he  nor  those  who 
loved  him  realized  that  the  end  was  so  near.  During 
the  first  few  days  he  enjoyed  hearing  the  newspapers 
read  and  seemed  anxious  to  keep  in  touch  with  current 
news ;  he  also  talked  freely  of  matters  of  personal  and 
family  interest.  But  the  disease  was  remorseless  and 
its  progress  rapid ;  all  that  his  physicians  could  say  at 


4gd  In  Memoriam 

the  end  of  a  week  was  that  they  would  make  his  suffer- 
ings as  light  as  possible.  With  increasing  weakness  he 
seemed  to  realize  that  the  result  was  inevitable,  and 
feeling  that  all  efforts  to  avert  it  were  futile,  he  re- 
marked one  day  "  Nature  is  inexorable."  The  next  day, 
when  so  weak  that  he  could  hardly  articulate  audibly,  his 
mind  seemed  to  be  musing  on  the  mystery  of  suffering 
and  the  inscrutable  ways  of  Divine  Providence,  and  he 
broke  out  with,  —  "  O  the  depth  of  the  riches  both  of 
the  wisdom  and  knowledge  of  God  1  how  iinsearcJiable 
are  his  judgments,  and  his  ways  past  finding  out !  "  A 
moment  later  he  added,  "  Whatever  my  shortcomings 
may  have  been,  I  have  faith  in  God  and  in  Jesus  Christ." 
He  said  but  little  after  this ;  he  recognized  those  dear 
to  him  on  Tuesday  ;  —  the  end  came  on  Wednesday 
morning,  May  23d,  and  on  Saturday,  the  26th,  his  re- 
mains were  laid  to  rest  in  the  family  lot  in  Forest  Hills. 
There  are  left  to  mourn  for  him  a  devoted  wife  and 
a  little  son, — too  young  to  appreciate  the  loss  of  a 
father,  —  aged  parents,  a  sister  and  a  brother,  all  over- 
whelmed with  grief. 

His  funeral  was  a  striking  evidence  of  the  respect  in 
which  he  was  held  by  his  business  associates,  his  em- 
ployees, even  by  his  competitors  ;  while  from  many  dis- 
tant cities  came  warm  expressions  of  sympathy,  and 
tributes  to  his  character  as  a  merchant  and  a  man. 

His  personal  friendships,  if  not  lavishly  bestowed, 
were  discreetly  chosen,  and  faithfully  cherished. 

He  was  a  lover  of  art,  and  for  many  years  was  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Boston  Art  Club. 

He  was  naturally  religious  ;  it  was  easy  for  him  to 
accept  the  cardinal  truths  of  Christianity,  and  although 


Charles    William  Blodgett  49*? 

not  of  a  demonstrative  nature,  his  faith  was  firm  and 
abiding ;  —  pure  in  thought  and  spirit,  his  daily  life  re- 
flected the  nobility  of  his  character,  and  the  perfect 
integrity  conspicuous  in  all  his  business  relations  had  its 
foundation  in  the  enduring  principles  of  rectitude  rather 
than  the  shifting  suggestions  of  policy. 

He  united  with  the  Shawmut  Congregational  Church 
in  his  youth,  and  when  he  removed  from  its  neighbor- 
hood, he  transferred  his  relation  to  the  Old  South 
Church,  of  which  organization  he  was  a  member  at  the 
time  of  his  death. 


FAMILY   OF  CALEB. 


ALEB/  son  of  AsaheP  and  Catherine 
(Pollard)  Blodgett,  was  born  in 
Hudson,  N.  H.  (then  Nottingham 
West),  Dec.  13,  1793  ;  died  in  Ca- 
naan, N.  H.,  Oct.  5,  1872.  By  occu- 
pation he  was  a  farmer,  but  was  much  in  public 
life,  and  for  many  years  was  one  of  the  most 
prominent  and  influential  men  in  his  native  State. 
For  an  interesting  review  of  his  public  services 
and  reminiscences  see  his  own  statement  in

days.     He  died  Oct.  29,  1853,  ^g^^  33  years. 
They  had  a  son  : 

I.  George^  Jackson,  born  in  Canaan,  April  30,  1848  ; 
died  there  Sept.  28,  1848,  aged  4  months,  28 
days. 

III.  Caleb,^  born  in  Dorchester,  N.  H.,  June  3,  1832  ; 
died  in  Canaan,  Dec.  11,  1901,  aged  69  years, 
6  months,  8  days.  A  lawyer,  and  Judge  of 
the  Superior  Court  of  Massachusetts.  He  was 
educated  in  the  public  schools  of  Canaan,  at 
Kimball  Union  Academy,  Meriden,  N.  H.,  and 
at  Dartmouth  College,  where  he  graduated  in 
1856.  His  alma  mater  conferred  the  degree 
of  LL.  D.  in  1889.  After  graduation  he  taught 
school  a  year  or  two  at  Fitchburg  and  Leo- 
minster, Mass.  He  began  his  legal  studies  at 
Canaan,  and  continued  them  in  the  office  of 
Bacon  &amp;  Aldrich,  Worcester,  Mass.,  and  was 
admitted  to  the  bar  at  Worcester,  Jan.  24,  i860. 
He  began  practice  at  Hopkinton,  but  within  a 
year  he  removed  to  Boston  and  became  a  mem- 
ber of  the  firm  of  Boardman  &amp;  Blodgett,  and 
this  relation  continued  twenty-one  years,  until 
January,  1882,  when  he  was  appointed  a  Justice 
of  the  Superior  Court  by  Governor  John  D. 
Long.  In  1 89 1  he  was  offered,  by  Governor 
Russell,  a  promotion  to  the  bench  of  the  Su- 
preme Judicial  Court,  but  his  health  was  some- 
what precarious,  and,  acting  upon  the  advice  of 
his  friends  and  physician,  he  deemed  it  unwise 
to  accept  it.  He  continued  to  serve  with  signal 
ability  upon  the  bench  of  the  Superior  Court 


52  Asahel  Blodgett 

until  March,  1900,  when  his  health  gave  way, 
and  in  September  following  he  resigned.  It 
was  hoped  by  his  family  and  friends  that  com- 
plete rest  might  bring  improvement  to  some- 
thing like  normal  conditions,  but  he  lingered 
with  uncertain  strength  until  his  death  at  his 
country  home  in  Canaan,  Dec.  11,  1901.  His

FAMILY   OF   JEREMIAH; 


IEREMIAH^  son  of  AsaheP  and  Lois 
(Pollard)  Blodgett,  was  born  in 
Hudson,  N.  H.  (then  Nottingham 
West),  March  lo,  1806;  died  in 
New  Haven,  Conn.,  Aug.  2,  1881  ; 
and  was  buried  at  Wentworth,  N.  H.  When 
he  was  but  a  few  months  old  his  parents  moved 
to  Dorchester,  N.  H,,  where  his  childhood  and 
youth  were  passed.  At  that  time  the  educa- 
tional advantages  of  that  section  of  the  State 
were  very  limited,  consisting  of  a  few  weeks' 
schooling  during  the  winter  months ;  but  not- 
withstanding these  limitations  he  succeeded,  by 
diligent  effort  and  application,  in  acquiring  an 
education  sufficient  to  enable  him  to  engage  in 
teaching  district  schools  in  the  winter  months, 
while  during  the  summer  months  he  worked  at 
brick-making.  At  the  age  of  twenty- six  he  had 
acquired  enough  to  purchase  a  good  farm  in 
Dorchester  and  to  begin  life  as  a  farmer,  though

owing  to  the  sterile  soil  of  that  town  he  did  not 
rapidly  accumulate  property.  After  a  few  years 
he  removed  to  Rumney,  N,  H.,  and  later  to  Went- 
worth.  For  a  more  extended  account  of  his  sub- 
sequent life  see  a  sketch  of  him  by  his  son,  Hon. 
Rufus  Blodgett,  of  New  Jersey,  in  Appendix  C.

daughter  of  Dea.  William  and  Hannah  (Brown) 
Johnson,  of  Wentworth,  born  April  8,  1813.  Both

Appendix   A. 


HON.  CALEB  BLODGETT  OF  NEW  HAMPSHIRE. 


Reminiscences  and  Reflections,  Dictated  to  his   Son, 
Caleb,  Jr.,  about  1870. 


)Y  great-grandfather,  Joseph  Blodgett,  set- 
tled in  Hudson  (then  Dunstable),  N.  H., 
about  1 710,  on  the  farm  where  Calvin 
Pollard  now  lives,  and  was  the  first  set- 
tler on  that  land,  and  one  of  the  first  in 
town.  He  was  a  small  man,  and  was 
born,  I  think,  in  Tyngsborough  or  Chelmsford,  Mass. 
He  went  up  the  Merrimac  River  in  a  canoe,  and  was 
led  to  settle  where  he  did  from  the  fact  that  the  lot  of 
land  where  he  built  his  house  was  an  Indian  corn-field. 
He  lived  in  a  garrison-house,  of  which  the  old  cellar  is 
still  to  be  seen ;  was  often  chased  by  the  Indians,  and 
was  once  or  twice  saved  from  capture  by  the  barking 
of  his  dog.  His  wife  was  a  Perham.  They  had  five 
sons  —  Joseph,  Jeremiah,  Ebenezer,  Jonathan  and  James 


64  Asahel  Blodgett 

—  and  two  daughters,  possibly  three.  One  of  the  daugh- 
ters married  a  Greeley,  and  lived  to  be  95  or  96  years 
old ;  and  one  a  Merrill,  who  was  killed  in  battle  in  the 
French  war.  His  widow  lived  to  be  nearly  100  years 
old. 

Joseph,  Jr.,  married  a  Wheeler  for  his  first  wife,  and 
Sarah  Cross  for  his  second,  and  died  in  Hudson  at  the 
age  of  about  Zy.  He  had  four  children  by  his  first 
wife  and  one  by  his  second. 

Ebenezer  and  James  both  moved  to  Plymouth,  N.  H., 
before  the  War  of  the  Revolution,  and  died  there. 

Jonathan  married  a  Provender,  from  York,  Me.,  and 
died  in  Hudson  when  he  was  about  96  years  old. 

Jeremiah  was  my  grandfather,  and  was  born  in  17 19, 
and  died  in  1796.  I  think  I  recollect  his  funeral,  and 
it  is  the  earliest  thing  I  do  remember.  He  died  on  the 
old  homestead  in  Hudson,  and  died  younger  than  any 
of  his  brothers  or  sisters.  He  was  a  large,  strong  man, 
of  light  complexion  and  blue  eyes ;  he  was  accustomed 
to  carry  two  bushels  of  grain  on  his  back  three  miles,  to 
Lovell's  mills  in  Nashua,  to  be  ground. 

He  married  Miriam  Provender,  a  most  excellent  wo- 
man, who  died  in  May,  1800.  It  was  her  practice  for 
many  years  to  raise  poultry,  and  in  the  fall  to  take  it  to 
Boston,  riding  one  horse  and  leading  another,  sell  the 
poultry,  then  go  to  Rhode  Island,  and,  with  the  money 
received  for  the  poultry,  buy  wool,  which  she  carried 
home  to  Hudson  and  carded,  spun  and  wove  into  cloth. 
Sheep  could  not  be  kept  at  Hudson  then  on  account  of 
wolves.  I  have  often  heard  my  father  tell  of  his  mother 
sitting  up  till  twelve  and  one  o'clock,  carding  and  spin- 
ning, the  only  light  being  what  could  be  obtained  from 


And  His  Descendants.  65 

burning  pine  knots  and  splints.  She  was  a  large  woman, 
much  resembling  my  sister  Lois,  and  lived  to  be  about 
eighty  years  old.  Her  children  were  Jeremiah,  Eben- 
ezer,  Asahel,  Hannah  (who  married  Stephen  Chase), 
Sarah,  Isaac,  and  Beniah. 

Jeremiah  and  Ebenezer  both  moved  to  Plymouth, 
married  there,  and  both  died  in  the  army,  during  the 
Revolutionary  War,  while  in  camp  near  Ticonderoga, 
Each  left  a  young  daughter.  My  grandfather,  hearing 
of  their  sickness,  went  on  horseback  to  see  them,  but 
both  died  before  he  got  there.  On  his  return  to  Hudson 
he  was  immediately  taken  sick  with  typhus  fever,  and 
before  he  had  recovered  every  other  member  of  his  fam- 
ily had  the  same  disease,  and  Isaac  and  Sarah  died  of  it. 
Hannah  (Mrs.  Chase)  died  in  Topsham,  Vt.,  about  1846, 
and  was  not  far  from  ninety  years  old.  Beniah  married 
a  Hamlet,  and  died  in  Dorchester,  January,  1830,  aged 
sixty-five,  leaving  no  children. 

My  father,  Asahel,  was  born  June  19,  1755,  and  died 
June  2,  1842.  He  remained  at  home  with  his  parents, 
and  for  their  support  received  the  homestead  farm.  In 
the  winter  of  1776  and  'yy  he  went  into  the  army  and 
was  sent  to  Fishkill,  N.  Y.,  was  taken  sick  with  fever 
almost  immediately  on  his  arrival,  and,  getting  a  fur- 
lough, he  went  to  Danbury,  Conn.,  where  he  remained 
until  his  short  term  of  service,  three  months,  was  out. 
He  married  Catherine  Pollard  about  1781  ;  she  died 
Dec.  20,  1895.  His  second  wife  was  Lois  Pollard,  sister 
of  his  first  wife,  to  whom  he  was  married,  I  think,  in 
1798. 

He  moved  to  Dorchester  in  March,  1806,  having 
bought  a  farm  there  the  previous   fall.     He   sold   his 


66  A  sake  I  Blodgett 

farm  in  Hudson  in  the  spring  of  1805,  but  by  agree- 
ment retained  possession  for  a  year  after.  The  Hudson 
farm  contained  about  one  hundred  acres,  and  was  sold 
for  $2,000.  The  Dorchester  farm  contained  four  hun- 
dred acres,  and  the  price  paid  for  it  was  $2,000.  The 
removal  from  Hudson  to  Dorchester  was  not  a  change 
for  the  better.  The  farm  at  Hudson  was  on  a  river, 
easily  tilled,  and  with  a  market  near  at  hand  for  any 
produce  the  farmer  had  to  sell.  The  Dorchester  farm 
was  in  a  poor  town,  seventy  miles  further  north,  away 
from  market,  schools  or  churches,  with  a  soil  which 
might  be  called  strong  but  cold,  wet,  stony,  and  hard  to 
till.  His  family  was  large,  and  he  wanted  more  land. 
The  summers  of  1804  and  1805  were  unusually  hot  and 
dry,  and  the  crops  at  Hudson  were  seriously  injured  by 
drought,  and  the  pastures  were  so  dry  that  stock  suf- 
fered greatly.  But  the  heat  and  drought  helped  the 
Dorchester  land,  so  that  when  my  father  went  there  in 
the  fall  of  1805  everything  appeared  to  the  best  advan- 
tage, and  this,  with  the  desire  for  more  land,  induced 
him  to  make  the  purchase.  The  seasons  soon  changed. 
1806  was  a  year  of  about  the  ordinary  temperature, 
but  1807,  '08,  '09  and  '10  were  cold  and  wet, —  1809 
especially,  —  and  that  year  very  little  corn  got  ripe  in 
Dorchester. 

My  father's  children  by  his  first  wife  were  Catherine, 
born  in  1781  ;  Asahel,  May  15,  1783;  Ebenezer,  Jan. 
14,  1786;  Isaac,  Aug.  18,  1787;  Sibyl,  Nov.  13,  1789; 
Lois,  Jan.,  1791  ;  and  myself,  Dec.  13,  1793  ;  and  by  his 
second  wife,  Rufus,  Dec,  1798  ;  Lucinda,  Nov.  12,  1800  ; 
Abner,  Dec.  5,  1802;  Beniah,  April,  1804;  Jeremiah, 
March  9,  1806;  and  Betsey,  May  14,  1810.     Catherine 


Aiid  His  Descendants  6y 

died  of  consumption  at  Hudson,  Dec.  lO,  1805  ;  Isaac, 
of  typhus  fever  at  Nashua,  Oct.  29,  18 16;  Beniah  of 
spotted  fever  at  Dorchester,  April,  18 17;  Sibyl,  March 
6,  1863  ;  Asahel,  April,  1863,  and  Ebenezer  at  Rumney, 
March,  1870. 

My  brother  Asahel  did  not  live  at  home  after  he  was 
sixteen  or  seventeen  years  old,  and  was  married  when 
he  was  twenty.  When  Isaac  was  sixteen  he  went  to 
live  with  his  uncle  Beniah  at  Nashua,  and  remained  with 
him  until  we  moved  to  Dorchester.  He  went  with  us 
and  lived  at  home  one  season,  but  afterwards  was  gen- 
erally away.  The  other  children,  except  when  occasion- 
ally away  at  work,  remained  at  home  until  they  became 
of  age.  In  March,  18 12,  Isaac  and  I  started  for  Boston 
for  work ;  we  walked  all  the  way,  and  carried  heavy 
packs.  I  went  to  work  for  Bowman  &amp;  Merriam,  who 
were  carrying  on  a  teaming  business.  My  work  was 
mainly  loading  wood  that  came  on  the  Middlesex  canal. 
The  work  was  too  hard  for  a  boy  and  it  strained  my 
stomach,  from  which  I  did  not  recover  for  four  years. 
I  returned  to  Dorchester  Aug.  20,  and  remained  there 
until  March,  18 16,  when  Asahel,  Isaac  and  I  left  for 
Boston  in  pursuit  of  work.  I  stopped  at  Nashua  and 
went  to  work  for  Uncle  Beniah,  Asahel  and  Isaac  going 
on  to  Boston.  In  October  following,  Isaac  was  taken 
sick  in  Boston  with  typhus  fever  ;  he  came  up  to  Nashua, 
and  there  he  died  at  Uncle  Beniah's.  I  took  care  of 
him  and  caught  the  disease,  but  had  it  in  a  mild  form. 
I  returned  to  Dorchester  the  last  of  November,  and 
lived  there  until  1833,  when  I  moved  to  Canaan. 

I  was  one  of  the  selectmen  of  Dorchester  in   18 19, 
again  in    1822,   and  four  or   five  years  after  that,  the 


68  Asahel  Blodgett 

last  year  being  1833.  I  was  the  representative  from 
Dorchester  in  the  State  Legislature  in  1823,  '24,  '25, 
'26,  '29  and  '30.  In  1833  and  '34  I  was  a  member  of 
the  New  Hampshire  Senate  from  District  No.  11.  I 
was  appointed  deputy  sheriff  in  May,  1833,  and  in  con- 
sequence of  that  appointment  I  moved  to  Canaan.  In 
October,  1835,  I  was  appointed  sheriff  of  Grafton 
County  and  held  the  office  until  1 840,  when  I  was  re- 
appointed deputy  sheriff  and  continued  in  office  until 
1855.  I  was  one  of  the  selectmen  of  Canaan  in  1838, 
'39,  '40,  '41  and  '49,  and  represented  the  town  in  the 
House  of  Representatives  in  1842  and  1843.  I  was 
one  of  the  road  commissioners  of  Grafton  County  in 
1 84 1  and  1842,  and  a  member  of  the  Governor's  Council 
in  1844  and  1845. 

The  style  of  living  in  my  father's  family  at  Hudson, 
and  among  the  people  generally  in  that  vicinity,  was  very 
plain  and  simple.  Milk,  corn  and  rye  bread,  and  bean- 
porridge,  were  the  staple  articles  of  food,  morning  and 
night,  with  meat  of  some  kind  at  noon.  Wheat  flour 
was  unknown.  The  first  wheat  bread  I  ever  saw  was 
at  Bow,  N.  H.,  on  my  way  from  Hudson  to  Dorchester, 
when  I  was  twelve  years  old.  Clothing  for  both  sexes 
was  nearly  all  home  made.  The  shoemaker  came  to 
the  house,  and  there  made  boots  and  shoes  for  the  family, 
the  customer  finding  his  own  leather.  Every  man  who 
employed  a  blacksmith  found  his  own  iron.  Houses  were 
poor,  never  plastered  and  usually  not  clap-boarded. 
There  was  little  money  in  circulation  at  Hudson,  and 
much  less  in  Dorchester.

HON.    CALEB    BLODGETT. 


The  Memorial. 


HE  members  of  the  Suffolk  Bar  take  this 
opportunity  to  make  pubhc  their  sincere 
appreciation  of  the  judicial  services  ren- 
dered by  the  late  Justice  Blodgett  upon 
the  bench  of  the  Superior  Court  of  this 
Commonwealth,  and  to  express  their  af- 
fection for  his  personal  qualities,  their  admiration  for 
his  character  and  attainments,  and  their  profound  sor- 
row that  their  personal  relations  with  him  have  been 
severed. 

Caleb  Blodgett,  for  nearly  twenty  years  a  Justice  of 
the  Superior  Court,  was  born  in  Dorchester,  N.  H.,  June 
3,  1832,  was  a  graduate  of  Dartmouth  College  in  1856, 
and  was  later  in  life  honored  by  the  same  college  with 
the  degree  of  LL.  D.  He  began  the  study  of  the  law 
after  teaching  for  two  years,  was  admitted  to  the  bar  at 


70  Asahel  B lodge tt 

Worcester  in  i860,  and  began  the  practice  of  his  pro- 
fession in  Hopkinton,  removing  to  Boston  in  i860.  He 
continued  in  active  and  steadily  increasing  practice  until 
1882,  when  he  was  commissioned  a  Justice  of  the  Su- 
perior Court,  and  the  real  work  of  his  life  began.  He 
was  later  offered  a  position  upon  the  Supreme  Bench 
by  Governor  Russell ;  but  his  health  was  such  that  he 
deemed  it  unwise  to  undertake  new  duties,  and  he  de- 
clined the  position.  This  decision  was  received  with 
regret  by  the  bar,  who  desired  for  him  the  highest 
judicial  honors,  and,  knowing  his  unusual  fitness  for 
the  office  he  then  held,  anticipated  for  him  with  confi- 
dence a  not  less  useful  and  brilliant  future  as  a  Judge 
of  our  highest  Court. 

He  took  no  part  in  local  or  general  politics,  but  de- 
voted his  whole  strength  and  energies  to  the  conscien- 
tious performance  of  his  official  duties.  Suffering 
intensely  from  a  disease  of  the  heart,  he  resigned  from 
the  bench  in  September,  1900,  and  died  at  his  summer 
home  in  New  Hampshire  on  Dec.  11,  1901. 

No  better  nisi prins  Judge  has  sat  upon  the  bench  of 
Massachusetts  in  this  generation.  He  combined  a  firm 
grasp  of  principle  with  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the 
decisions  and  a  marked  power  of  lucid  statement.  He 
had  an  eager  love  for  the  truth,  and  was  not  easily  de- 
ceived by  the  evasions  of  a  witness  or  the  sophistries  of 
counsel.  His  sense  of  justice  was  strong,  and  he  did 
his  best  to  see  that  it  was  done  in  every  case  that  was 
tried  before  him.  He  had  a  quiet  but  complete  control 
of  all  trials  before  him.  He  was  uniformly  patient  and 
courteous  to  counsel  and  witnesses,  but  firm  and  decided 
in  his  rulings,  which  were  the  results  of  proper  delib- 


And  His  Descendants  yi 

erations,  and  were  seldom  found  to  be  wrong.  He  did 
not  shrink  from  responsibility,  but  was  anxious  that  what- 
ever ruling  he  made  should  be  stated  so  clearly  that,  if 
he  was  in  error,  it  might  not  go  uncorrected,  letting  no 
pride  of  opinion  weigh  against  his  sense  of  justice.  He 
spared  no  pains  to  make  the  jury  understand  the  issues 
involved  in  litigation,  and  he  did  not  hesitate  to  set  aside 
their  verdict  when  he  was  satisfied  that  it  was  wrong. 
He  was  in  every  essential  a  model  of  what  a  Judge 
should  be.  The  Commonwealth  has  been  fortunate  in 
having  the  service  of  so  admirable  a  magistrate  for  so 
many  years,  but  it  makes  our  regret  only  the  keener  that 
his  usefulness  was  not  prolonged,  and  that  he  was  unable 
to  accept  the  seat  on  the  Supreme  Bench  which  would 
have  made  his  contributions  to  the  law  of  Massachusetts 
more  permanent.  He  enjoyed  the  respect  and  confi- 
dence of  us  all  while  he  lived,  and  it  is  with  the  most 
sincere    sorrow    that    we    offer  this  last   tribute  to  his 

memory.

Judge  Blodgett  was  graduated  from  Dartmouth  Col- 
lege in  1856.  We  men  of  Massachusetts  gratefully 
recognize  the  obligations  we  owe  to  that  institution  of 
learning  which  has  given  so  much  to  us.  Scan  our 
judicial  history,  and  you  will  find  page  after  page  illu-

mined  by  the  labor  of  her  graduates ;  and  she  speaks 
to-day  from  our  bench  with  the  same  learning,  the  wise 
judgment,  the  spirit  of  patient  and  searching  investiga- 
tion, and  the  influence  of  high  character  with  which 
those  whom  she  has  trained  have  been  endowed 

The  undergraduate  life  of  Judge  Blodgett  was  marked 
rather  by  evidences  of  sterling  character,  conscientious 
attention  to  the  work  that  lay  before  him,  and  capacity 
to  master  thoroughly  the  studies  he  had  entered  upon, 
than  by  brilliancy  or  ease  of  achievement.  He  rightly 
earned  a  place  among  the  very  first  scholars  of  his 
class,  and  had  the  universal  regard  and  respect  of  his 
fellows. 

The  first  forecast  of  his  life-work  exhibited  a  curious 
unconsciousness  of  the  great  power  he  later  developed. 
Partly,  perhaps,  from  a  desire  to  immediately  acquire  the 
means  of  livelihood,  but  undoubtedly  also  because  of 
great  interest  in  the  work,  he  became  the  principal  of 
the  High  School  at  Leominster,  in  the  county  of  Wor- 
cester. And  there  are  many  now  living  in  that  town, 
and  many  more,  widely  scattered  over  our  country,  who 
gratefully  testify  to  the  influence  of  his  example  and  the 
benefit  of  his  instruction. 

I  well  remember  a  summer  afternoon,  when  I  went 
with  him  from  court  in  Fitchburg,  when  he  made  a  pil- 
grimage to  those  old  scenes.  With  the  keenest  pleasure 
he  marked  and  spoke  of  the  beauty  of  the  river,  valley, 
and  woodlands  he  knew,  and  of  the  homes  in  which  he 
had  been  welcomed.  I  saw  the  greetings  of  those  who 
had  known  him,  full  of  that  affection  and  cordiality 
mingled  with  respect  which  told  that  his  earlier  associa- 
tions had  ripened  into  lifelong  ties 


And  His  Descendants  73 

No  judicial  life  was  ever  more  pure  or  more  exalted 
in  ideals  than  his.  Whatever  there  was  of  human  frailty 
in  his  temperament,  it  was  in  court  never  suffered  to 
appear.  Ignorance  of  procedure  or  mere  lack  of  knowl- 
edge of  the  law,  or  even  unconscious  temerity  of  coun- 
sel, excited  in  him  no  manifestation  of  impatience  or 
irritation.  With  the  utmost  consideration  he  brought 
out  the  truth  from  a  dull  or  frightened  witness.  Only 
in  case  of  willful  falsehood  or  plain  disclosure  of  an  at- 
tempt to  pervert  justice  did  his  indignation  show  itself  ; 
and  then  it  was  the  dignity  and  power  of  the  law  that 
spoke  in  crushing  denunciation,  never  tainted  by  accent 
of  passion  or  anger.  I  believe  no  one  of  us  who  ever 
practiced  before  him  can  recall  a  single  instance  or  occa- 
sion when,  from  the  bench,  a  word  of  impatience  or  per- 
sonal irritation  escaped  him.  He  was  to  my  mind  the 
incarnation  of  deliberate,  calm  judgment 

His  charges  to  juries  were  masterpieces,  and  I  think 
his  most  memorable  service  in  the  efBcient  and  sound 
administration  of  the  law  lay  here.  His  line  of  thought 
was  beautifully  clear  and  logical,  but  followed  those  paths 
of  reasoning  along  which  the  minds  of  the  jury  could 
most  readily  follow  him.  His  choice  of  language  was 
admirable,  simple,  yet  exact  and  apt  and  always  perfectly 
intelligible.  His  absolute  fairness  of  mind,  his  evident 
sincerity  of  purpose  to  see  absolute  justice  done,  his 
dignified  and  impressive  appearance,  led  every  juryman 
not  only  to  obey  his  every  instruction  of  law,  but  as 
well  to  realize  its  reason  and  its  justice.  No  Judge  ever 
more  strictly  abstained  from  invading  the  province  of 
the  jury  upon  the  facts,  yet  no  Judge  was  more  fearless 


74  Asahel  Blodgett 

in  the  exercise  of  the  inherent  power  of  the  Court  to  set 
aside  a  verdict  manifestly  grounded  upon  error  in  their 
deliberations. 


From  Response  of  His  Honor  Chief-Justice  Mason. 

Brethren  of  the  Bar :  —  In  our  imperfect  acceptance 
of  the  great  facts  of  life,  a  tinge  of  sadness  attends  a 
review  of  the  life-work  of  loved  associates  who  have 
recently  gone  from  us.  The  clouds  which  thus  depress 
the  spirit  are  but  the  mist  of  earth  shutting  out  the 
ever-constant  sun  of  heaven.  To  the  unobstructed 
vision,  death  becomes  an  orderly  step  in  continuous 
human  life,  the  joyous  entrance  upon  a  freer  and  more 
delightful  stage  of  manhood. 

The  contemplation  of  efficient,  manly  living  in  others 
should  be  uplifting  and  stimulative  of  all  which  enriches 
our  own  lives.  The  exceptional  attainment  of  Judge 
Blodgett,  which  you  have  portrayed  with  appreciative 
commendation,  did  not  spring  forth  suddenly  as  you  saw 
it  in  its  full  maturity.  He  had  indeed  an  inheritance 
of  more  than  usual  strength,  but  the  symmetrical  vigor 
of  the  man  was  a  growth  involving  lifelong  effort  with 
constant  vigilance. 

It  was  a  sturdy  stock  from  which  he  sprung.  The 
sterile  farms  of  his  native  town  produced  vigorous  men, 
though  their  other  products  were  meagre.  Native  thrift 
and  diligence  wrested  moderate  competency  from  most 
adverse  conditions.  Judge  Blodgett  wasted  no  early 
years  in  aught  that  poisoned  or  weakened  the  sources  of 
character.  While  he  entered  heartily  into  the  normal 
diversions  of  youth,  these  were  not  suffered  to  prevent 


And  His  Descendants  75 

earnest  application  to  serious  preparation  for  the  life- 
work  which  was  to  follow. 

His  early  opportunities  for  the  acquisition  of  knowl- 
edge were  those  of  a  country  boy  in  a  family  of  limited 
means.  He  was  accustomed  to  aid  by  his  own  earnings 
in  obtaining  advantages  which  the  public  school  then 
failed  to  furnish.  From  the  first  he  manifested  marked 
aptness  for  study  and  conscientious  application  to  im- 
prove every  opportunity  open  to  him.  He  secured  in 
the  Academy  at  Canaan,  his  boyhood  home,  and  at  the 
famous  Kimball  Union  Academy  at  Meriden,  N.  H.,  the 
best  preparation  for  college  to  be  had  in  his  vicinity ; 
and  at  the  age  of  twenty  he  entered  Dartmouth,  admira- 
bly equipped  to  make  the  most  of  the  larger  opportunity 
there  afforded. 

His  class-work  in  college  was  thorough ;  but  he  did 
not  need,  nor  was  he  content,  to  limit  his  studies  to 
what  this  required,  but  read  widely  and  thoughtfully.  It 
was  inevitable  that  he  should  take  high  rank  at  gradua- 
tion,— he  was  second  in  a  class  of  sixty, —  but  this 
measured  a  small  part  only  of  what  the  four  years  at 
Hanover  had  accomplished,  in  aid  of  the  upbuilding  of 
that  sterling  character  which  characterized  his  after-life. 

At  graduation  he  was,  in  physique,  a  fit  embodiment 
of  the  intellectual  and  moral  strength  within.  It  was 
but  the  natural  manifestation  of  his  sturdy  character 
that  he  should  at  once  stand  upon  his  own  feet  and  spend 
two  years  in  teaching.  As  principal  of  the  High  School 
at  Leominster,  Mass.,  he  put  the  whole  strength  of  his 
young  manhood  into  the  work  in  hand.  He  enjoyed 
his  temporary  service  as  a  teacher,  and  always  retained 
pleasant  recollections  of  the  community  in  which  it  was 


^6  Asahel  Blodgett 

rendered,  and  where  his  administration  of  the  school  is 
still  remembered  as  a  model  of  excellence 

His  legal  studies  were  begun  at  his  home  in  Canaan, 
but  principally  pursued  in  the  office  of  Bacon  &amp;  Aldrich 
at  Worcester.  He  was  admitted  to  the  bar  Jan.  24, 
i860,  at  Worcester.  He  began  practice  with  his  col- 
lege classmate,  the  Hon.  Henry  L.  Parker,  at  Hopkin- 
ton ;  but  later  in  the  same  year  he  came  to  Boston,  where 
for  twenty-one  years  he  applied  himself  closely  to  prac- 
tice at  the  bar,  early  winning  the  confidence  of  an  ex- 
tended clientHe,  and  securing  an  excellent  standing  in 
the  profession.  While  not  wanting  in  forcible  and  effec- 
tive presentation  of  causes  to  court  or  jury,  his  reputation 
was  that  of  a  sound  lawyer  rather  than  that  of  a  brilliant 
advocate 

In  January,  1882,  he  was  appointed  a  Justice  of  the 
Superior  Court.  He  found  in  judicial  labor  the  oppor- 
tunity for  service  which  was  most  congenial  to  his  tastes 
and  for  which  his  qualifications  were  well  nigh  ideal. 
For  eighteen  years  he  gave  himself  unreservedly  to  this 
service.  He  strove  to  make  his  part  in  it  worthy  of  the 
Commonwealth  and  its  best  traditions.  It  was  his  crown- 
ing life-work,  and  by  it  we  measure  his  success 

In  1889  the  degree  of  LL,  D.  was  conferred  upon  him 
by  Dartmouth  College.  Two  years  later  he  was  offered 
a  deserved  promotion  to  the  Supreme  Judicial  Court ; 
but,  after  consultation  with  friends  and  with  his  phy- 
sician, he  deemed  it  unwise  to  make  a  radical  change  in 
his  work 


And  His  Descendants  yy 

His  labors  with  us  continued  unbroken  until  March, 
1900,  when  from  physical  exhaustion  he  was  obliged  to 
suspend  them.  They  were  never  resumed,  and  in  the 
following  September  he  resigned.  He  lingered  with 
varying  degrees  of  strength  until  Dec.  11,  1 901,  when 
he  died  at  his  summer  home  in  Canaan,  N.  H.,  in  his 
seventieth  year. 

To  adequately  summarize  the  life  of  another,  one  must 
catch  something  of  his  spirit.  As  a  fellow- worker.  Judge 
Blodgett  was  kindly  and  helpful.  Generous  in  his  ap- 
preciation of  the  best  traits  of  his  associates,  he  seemed 
to  know  no  other  qualities.  As  we  saw  him  in  close 
intimacy,  free  from  the  restraint  of  publicity  or  formal 
functions,  our  respect  for  him  was  in  no  way  diminished. 

The  every-day  life,  in  which  he  was  at  home  and  in 
perfect  freedom,  was  upon  a  high  plane ;  yet  the  pro- 
longed prostration  of  the  final  illness  revealed  even  to 
his  most  intimate  friends  a  depth  and  delicacy  of  feeling 
which  had  before  been  veiled  in  modest  reserve 

His  culture  was  by  no  means  confined  to  the  law. 
In  general  knowledge  it  was  broad,  and  in  several  lines 
it  was  careful  and  thorough.  It  cannot  be  said  that  his 
attainments  were  those  of  a  brilliant,  many-sided  scholar, 
but  it  is  true  that  they  were  solid  and  substantial  in  the 
lines  which  he  pursued.  His  reading  was  in  the  main 
serious  and  thoughtful  He  had  a  keen  appreciation  of 
felicity  of  expression  when  there  was  a  thought  worthy 
of  expression  ;  but  he  was  impatient  of  empty  phrases, 
however  gracefully  framed. 

With  our  friend  and  associate  the  books  of  this  pre- 
paratory life   are    closed.     He  has   filled  out   the  "six

days "  within  which  the  law  from  which  there  is  no 
escape  requires  that  all  work  of  the  earthly  plane  shall 
be  done.  So  far  as  human  judgment  may  pass  upon  the 
record,  happy  will  it  be  for  each  one  of  us,  if,  when  the 
earthly  task  is  complete,  it  can  be  said  to  furnish  like 
preparation  for  the  higher  service  of  the  Sabbath  which 
follows,  and  like  reason  for  the  final  word,  "Well  done, 
thou  good  and  faithful  servant." 

The  Resolution  presented  will  be  entered  of  record, 
and  the  Court  will  stand  adjourned  for  the  day.

SKETCH  OF  THE  LIFE  OF  JEREMIAH^  BLODGETT. 


By  his  Son,  Hon.  Rufus^  Blodgett,  of  New  Jersey. 


1842  and  1843. 


[HROUGH  his  whole  life  he  took  a  deep 
interest  in  political  affairs  and  was  fre- 
quently elected  to  various  town  offices. 
He  represented  the  town  of  Dorchester, 
N.  H.,  in  the  Legislature  during  the  years 
In  1845  ^^  moved  to  Rumney,  N.  H., 
where  he  continued  his  vocation  of  farming  until  the 
following  year,  when  he  was  appointed  deputy  sheriff  for 
Grafton  County. 

In  1847  he  moved  to  Wentworth,  N.  H.,  where  he 
ever  after  resided.  His  appointment  as  deputy  sheriff 
raised  a  bitter  feeling  among  the  friends  of  the  rival 
candidate,  whom  he  had  succeeded  in  that  office.  So 
determined  were  his  opponents  to  crush  him  that  Hon. 
Josiah  Quincy,  of  Rumney,  then  a  prominent  member 
of  the  bar,  refused  to  allow  the  business  of  his  office  to 
be  transacted  by  Mr.  Blodgett ;  and  in  order  more  ef- 


8o  Asahel  Blodgett 

fectually  to  break  down  the  new  sheriff,  Mr.  Quincy, 
then  a  leading  member  of  the  Legislature,  succeeded  in 
procuring  the  passage  of  laws  conferring,  to  a  great  ex- 
tent, the  powers  and  duties  of  the  sheriff's  office  upon 
constables  elected  by  the  different  towns.  After  two 
years  of  agitation  the  objectionable  laws  were  repealed, 
to  which  result  Mr.  Blodgett  contributed  largely  by  his 
influence  and  exertion.  The  extreme  bitterness  which 
had  been  manifested  against  his  appointment  gradually 
passed  away,  so  that  at  the  end  of  his  two  terms  of  five 
years  each  as  deputy  sheriff  his  former  opponents  be- 
came his  warmest  friends  and  supporters. 

He  was  prompt  and  efficient  as  a  public  officer,  yet 
generous  to  a  fault,  seldom  exacting  his  full  legal  fees 
from  a  poor  debtor.  He  performed  his  unpleasant  du- 
ties with  the  least  possible  annoyance  and  expense  to 
parties  in  litigation,  and  very  frequently  sustained  loss 
by  his  indulgence,  often  relinquishing  his  fees  rather 
than  add  to  the  burdens  of  the  poor. 

His  wife  died  in  February,  1849,  and  was  buried  in 
the  family  burying  lot  at  Wentworth  village.  He  mar- 
ried a  second  time,  in  September,  185 1,  Ann  B.,  daugh- 
ter of  the  late  Judge  Samuel  Burns,  of  Rumney,  who 
survived  him.  No  children  were  born  to  him  by  his  last 
marriage. 

Mr.  Blodgett  was  a  member  of  the  Constitutional  Con- 
vention of  1850,  which  was  presided  over  by  Franklin 
Pierce,  and  contained  among  its  members  some  of  the 
most  distinguished  men  of  the  State.  He  was  also  a 
member  of  the  Convention  of  1876,  which  reported  the 
present  Constitution  of  the  State.  He  was  also  the  candi- 
date of  his  party  for  the  office  of  Registrar  of  Deeds  for 


And  His  Descendants  8t 

Grafton  County  in  the  years  1855,  '56,  57,  '58,  but  was 
defeated,  as  were  those  associated  with  him  on  the  Dem- 
ocratic ticket.  During  the  administration  of  President 
Buchanan  he  was  tendered  the  appointment  of  inspector 
at  the  Boston  Custom  House,  but  dechned  it.  He 
accepted  the  appointment  of  mail  route  agent  between 
Concord  and  Littleton,  serving  until  relieved  by  a  change 
of  the  National  Administration.  He  represented  the 
town  of  Wentworth  in  the  Legislature  during  the  ses- 
sions of  1870,  '71.  '72,  and  was  elected  a  member  of  the 
Governor's  Council  in  1875  and  1877. 

Mr.  Blodgett  was  a  pronounced  Democrat  and  never 
swerved  from  that  political  faith.  He  believed  in  the 
Jeffersonian  doctrine  of  State  Rights,  and  voted  for  Mr. 
Breckenridgc  for  President,  in  i860,  because  of  those 
views.  He  was  for  many  years  one  of  the  prominent 
Democrats  of  the  State,  his  active  participation  in  politi- 
cal and  business  affairs  covering  a  period  of  more  than 
half  a  century.  He  was  endowed  with  an  unusually 
sound  discretion,  and  lived  an  active,  useful  Hfe ;  but  he 
seemed  to  enjoy  serving  others  better  than  himself. 
Caring  little  for  worldly  gain,  he  loved  his  books  and 
the  knowledge  derived  from  them,  and  being  a  great 
reader,  of  a  remarkably  retentive  memory,  he  had  become 
possessed  of  a  store  of  general  and  varied  information 
equalled  by  few.  He  possessed  great  force  of  charac- 
ter and  firm  determination  of  purpose,  and  yet  his 
was  the  tenderness  of  a  child.  An  appeal  to  his  charity 
always  met  a  just  response ;  his  sympathy  was  easily  ex- 
cited and  often  caused  him  to  make  sacrifices  for  the 
benefit  of  others.  His  attachments  were  strong  and 
enduring,  particularly  to  his  family  and   kindred.     His 


82  A  sake  I  B  lodge  tt 

friends  and  intimates  were  those  of  kindred  spirits,  and 
so  keen  was  his  perception  of  character,  that  he  who 
once  gained  his  full  confidence  and  respect  always  re- 
tained it. 

Having  been  reared  in  the  strictest  Calvinistic  faith, 
he  naturally  became  imbued  with  the  views  of  his  ances- 
tors, and  although  never  uniting  with  the  church,  he  was 
in  early  life  in  full  accord  with  its  teachings.  So  deeply 
impressed  was  he  with  the  importance  of  the  subject 
that  he  devoted  years  to  a  careful  study  of  the  Bible, 
earnestly  invoking  Divine  aid  in  search  of  the  truth. 
His  earnest  and  patient  investigation  resulted  in  a 
change  of  belief,  and  he  became  a  pronounced  Deist, 
or  Liberal,  which  latter  views  he  entertained  through 
life. 

Mr.  Blodgett  was  a  very  robust  man,  enjoying  excel- 
lent health  until  within  a  few  weeks  of  his  death,  which 
occurred  at  New  Haven,  August  2,  1 881,  in  the  seventy- 
sixth  year  of  his  age.  The  funeral  services  took  place 
at  his  late  residence  in  Wentworth,  N.  H.,  and  was 
attended  by  a  large  concourse  of  friends  and  prominent 
citizens  from  different  parts  of  the  State.

SKETCH    OF    THE   LIFE   OF    RUFUS^   BLODGETT 


UFUS^  BLODGETT,  of  Long  Branch, 
N.  J.,  was  born  in  Dorchester,  N.  H., 
Oct.  9,  1834.  His  parents  were  Jere- 
miah and  Amanda  (Johnson)  Blodgett, 
both  descendants  of  distinguished  New 
England  ancestry.  He  was  educated  in  the  public  schools 
of  his  native  State  and  at  the  Wentworth,  N.  H.,  Acad- 
emy. He  learned  the  trade  of  a  locomotive  builder  at 
the  Amoskeag  Locomotive  Works  of  Manchester,  N.  H., 
beginning  while  very  young.  He  followed  his  trade  for 
several  years  in  New  Hampshire  and  afterwards  at  New 
Haven,  Conn.  He  was  appointed  master-mechanic  of 
the  New  Jersey  Southern  Railroad  in  1866,  and  in  1874 
became  its  superintendent.  In  1884  he  was  appointed 
to  the  position  which  he  still  holds  —  superintendent  of 
the  New  York  &amp;  Long  Branch  Railroad. 

As  a  railroad  manager,  a  politician  and  a  business  man 
he  has  ranked  among  the  prominent  citizens  of  New  Jer- 


84  A  sake  I  Blodgett 

sey  for  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century.  As  a  life-long 
democrat  he  has  held  many  of  the  most  important  politi- 
cal offices  in  the  gift  of  his  party,  and  in  the  councils  of 
the  New  Jersey  Democracy  he  still  exerts  a  powerful  in- 
fluence in  shaping  their  acts  and  policy. 

He  was  elected  a  member  of  the  New  Jersey  Assembly 
in  1877,  was  re-elected  in  1878  and  in  1879,  and  in  the 
latter  year  he  was  the  candidate  of  his  party  for  Speaker. 
In  1880  he  was  one  of  New  Jersey's  district  delegates 
to  the  National  Democratic  Convention  which  nominated 
General  Hancock  for  the  Presidency,  and  a  delcgate-at- 
large  to  the  Convention  in  1 896  which  nominated  Wil- 
liam J.  Bryan.  During  the  presidential  contest  of  1884 
he  was  chairman  of  the  Democratic  State  Committee. 

In  the  Democratic  State  Convention  of  1886,  Mr. 
Blodgett  was  the  strong  rival  of  Robert  S.  Green  for  the 
gubernatorial  nomination  and  was  defeated,  on  a  close 
vote,  after  an  exciting  and  bitterly  fought  contest.  The 
following  year  he  was  elected  United  States  Senator  and 
served  in  that  capacity  until  the  close  of  his  term  in 
1893.  He  was  elected  Mayor  of  Long  Branch  in  1893 
and  was  re-elected  each  year  afterward  until  1898. 

He  assisted  in  organizing  the  First  National  Bank, 
and  the  Citizens'  National  Bank  of  Long  Branch,  N.  J., 
and  became  president  of  each  at  its  organization.  At 
present  he  is  president  of  the  Citizens'  National  Bank  of 
Long  Branch,  a  director  of  the  First  National  Bank  of 
Princeton,  N,  J.,  of  the  First  National  Bank  of  South 
Amboy,  N.  J.,  and  president  of  the  Tintern-Manor 
Water  Company. 

His  paternal  grandfather  was  Asahel^  Blodgett,  a 
soldier  of  the  American  Revolution.

On  the  maternal  side,  his  great-grandfathers  Samuel 
Johnson  and  William  Brown  both  rendered  distinguished 
service  during  the  Revolution,  the  one  in  the  army  and 
the  other  in  the  navy,  for  which  service  each  received 
a  pension  from  the  government  up  to  the  time  of  his 
death.  Samuel  Johnson  was  born  in  Sutton,  N.  H., 
and  died  at  Wcntworth,  N.  H.  in  1847.  William  Brown 
was  born  in  England  about  1753  and  came  to  this 
country  in  1772.  He  enlisted  on  board  the  American 
frigate  "  Boston,"  and  sailed  from  Marblchead  under 
Captain  Samuel  Tucker.  Afterwards  his  vessel  was 
used  to  transport  to  Europe  John  Adams  and  his  son 
John  Quincy  Adams,  the  former  as  Minister  to  France.

jN  the  summer  of  1904,  Kimball  Webster, 
Esq.,  a  public  spirited  citizen  of  Hudson, 
N.  H.,  and  the  historian  and  antiquarian 
of  that  town,  erected,  at  his  own  expense, 
a  memorial  tablet  to  mark  the  site  of  the 
"  Blodgett  Garrison  House  "  built  in  that  town  about 
1 7 10  by  Joseph  Blodgett,  who  went  from  that  part  of 
Chelmsford,  Mass.,  which  was  in  1730  set  off  as  the 
present  town  of  Westford. 

A  description  of  the  memorial,  with  some  genealogical 
reminiscences,  published  in  the  NasJina  Press  of  June  i, 
1 904,  is  appended  :  —

This  is  the  inscription  on  a  bronze  tablet,  securely  placed 
on  the  south  front  of  a  granite  boulder  weighing  three  tons , 
supported  by  a  granite  foundation  in  the  earth  to  mark  the 
spot  where  one  of  the  first  three  garrison  houses  was  erected 


88  Asahcl  Blodzett 


'i&gt;' 


on  the  east  side  of  the  Merrimack  river  in  old   Dunstable 
nearly  two  hundred  years  ago. 

The  location  of  the  boulder  is  in  a  field  on  a  line  with  the 
Lowell  electrics,  about  sixty  rods  west  of  the  house  of  P.  J. 
Connell  in  Hudson.  It  is  a  lovely  spot  where  this  old  home 
of  the  first  settlers  was  located.  It  was  built  on  ground 
sloping  to  the  south,  which  borders  the  Merrimack  river,  a 
short  walk  by  trail  to  the  banks.  At  the  north  is  a  fine 
spring  of  water  which  bubbles  forth  to-day  just  as  attractively 
as  it  did  when  the  Blodgett  ancestral  home  was  erected  and 
the  family  visited  it  to  obtain  their  water  supply. 

At  the  west  the  forest  is  still  in  its  primeval  glory,  and 
looking  from  the  historic  spot  in  either  direction  one  is 
charmed  by  the  expanse  of  meadow  and  beautiful  landscape. 
On  Saturday  this  tablet  was  placed  in  position  by  the  efforts 
of  Mr.  Webster,  assisted  by  Mr.  Connell,  and  from  this  time 
on  there  will  be  no  further  question  as  to  the  site  of  the  Blod- 
gett garrison  house.  The  child  mentioned  lived  to  be  eighty 
years  old,  was  quite  prominent  as  one  of  the  townsmen,  and 
is  buried  in  the  Blodgett  yard,  a  plain  slate  stone  marking 
his  resting  place.  The  tablet  and  boulder  were  put  in  posi- 
tion without  formal  exercises,  the  tablet  being  prepared  and 
set  up  by  T.  D.  Fuller  of  this  city  for  Mr.  Webster. 

This  house  was  one  of  the  four  that  were  built  by  the  first 
settlers  who  came  from  Tyngsboro.  North  of  these  there 
was  an  unbroken  wilderness  to  the  Canadas.  These  garri- 
son houses  were  the  Fletcher  garrison  house  now  located  in 
Tyngsboro,  the  Blodgett  at  this  point,  the  John  Taylor  on 
the  river  road  near  the  residence  of  Mr.  Webster,  and  the 
Hills  garrison  house  on  the  extreme  north  of  the  settlement. 
These  block  houses  were  all  built  about  the  year  17 lo,  and 
it  is  supposed  that  the  Hills  garrison  house  was  the  first 
to  be  put  up. 

The  town  then  had  twelve  or  fourteen  inhabitants  with 
trails  connecting  through  the  unbroken  forests.    To-day  it  has 


And  His  Descendants  89 

a  population  of  twelve  hundred,  with  electric  cars  running 
within  sixty  rods  of  the  port-holed  mansions  built  to  protect 
the  people  from  the  attacks  of  hostile  Indian  raiders.  After 
Captain  Lovewell's  fight  there  came  peace  for  these  hardy 
settlers,  and  soon  afterward  the  savages  were  driven  back 
toward  the  Canadian  frontiers. 

Mr.  Webster,  in  placing  a  mark  on  this  historical  spot  at 
his  own  expense,  is  entitled  to  the  thanks  of  his  fellow 
townsmen , 

The  history  of  the  Blodgett  family  and  the  incidents  con- 
nected with  their  home  are  as  follows ; — 

Thomas  Blodgett  sailed  from  London  for  Boston,  April  18, 
1635,  in  the  ship  Increase,  and  settled  in  Cambridge.  His 
son  Daniel,^  born  in  England  in  1631,  married  Sept.  15, 
1653,  Mary  Butterfield  and  removed  to  Chelmsford,  Mass. 

Thomas,3  son  of  Daniel,^  born  June  25,  1654,  resided  in 
Chelmsford. 

Joseph,4  son  of  Thomas,^  born  in  Chelmsford  Oct.  10, 
1689,  married  Dorothy  Perham,  and  removed  to  the  east 
side  of  the  river  in  Dunstable  (now  Hudson),  previous  to 
17 18,  where  he  built  a  garrison.  Tradition  says  he  came  up 
the  river  Merrimack  in  a  canoe,  and  settled  where  the  In- 
dians had  previously  had  a  cornfield,  which  was  about  eight 
acres  of  cleared  land ;  that  he  was  a  small  man,  was  some- 
times pursued  by  the  Indians,  and  that  he  was  once  or 
twice  saved  from  capture  by  the  barking  of  his  trusty 
dog.  He  died  Dec.  3,  1761,  in  the  seventy-fourth  year  of 
his  age.  Dorothy,  his  widow,  died  March  6,  1778,  in  the 
eighty-fourth  year  of  her  age. 

Joseph,s  their  eldest  child,  as  recorded  in  the  old  Dun- 
stable records,  was  born  Feb.  9,  17 19,  which  evidently  should 
have  been  recorded  17 18,  as  the  inscription  on  his  headstone 
in  the  Old  South,  or  Blodgett  Cemetery,  gives  his  death  as  of 
Aug.  16,  1 80 1,  in  the  eighty-fourth  year  of  his  age.  This 
would  make  his  birth  in   17 18.     And   further,  the  birth  of 


90  A  sake  I  Blodgett 

Ebenezers  Blodgett,  their  second  son,  is  given  as  Jan.  3,  1720, 
which  would  be  possible,  but  not  probable. 

They  had  other  children:  Jeremiah, s  born  July  20,  1721  ; 
Dorothy,5  born  Feb.  18,  1724  ;  Rebecca,s  born  Feb,  3,  1728  ; 
Jonathan, 5  born  Dec.  5,  1730,  as  recorded,  but  from  age  at 
death  and  church  records,  he  was  probably  born  in  1726; 
James,5  born  Feb.  17,  1734;  Josephs  Blodgett,  Jr.,  married, 
first,  Dorcas  Wheeler :  they  had  children,  Dorcas,^  born  Dec. 
II,  1757;  Joseph,^  born  Feb.  10,  1760:  Phineas  Wheeler,^ 
born  Oct.  9,  1761  ;  Judah^  and  Abigail,^  twins,  born  June  25, 
1763;  Judah  died  Oct.  15,  1763.  Dorcas  died  June  29, 
1763,  in  the  thirty-fourth  year  of  her  age,  and  Joseph  married 
second,  Sarah  Cross,  daughter  of  Nathan  and  Sarah  Cross, 
born  June  26,  1731. 

This  Nathan  Cross  was  taken  prisoner  with  Thomas  Blan- 
chard,  by  a  party  of  Mohawk  Indians,  Sept.  4,  1724,  when 
employed  in  gathering  turpentine,  a  short  distance  north  of 
the  present  Nashua  cemetery,  and  they  were  carried  to  Can- 
ada as  prisoners.  They  effected  their  release  in  the  spring 
of  1725,  and  returned  home  through  the  wilderness. 

A  very  large  proportion  of  the  inhabitants  of  this  town,  by 
various  names,  are  descendants  of  the  first  Joseph.  Judge 
Isaac  N.  Blodgett  late  Chief  Justice  of  New  Hampshire,  is 
a  descendant  of  this  Joseph^  Blodgett.  So  also  is  Judge 
John  T.  Blodgett  of  Providence,  R.  I.,  the  late  Judge  Caleb 
Blodgett  of  Boston,  Mass.,  and  the  late  Jere.  Blodgett  and 
Caleb  Blodgett,  so  well  known  in  this  State,  as  well  as  many 
other  distinguished  citizens  of  our  country.

HOMAS  BLOGGET/  aged  30, 
and  wife,  aged  37,  embarked  at 
London  in  the  ship  Increase, 
April  18,  1635.  They  arrived 
in  Boston  and  settled  in  "  New- 
towne,"  now  Cambridge,  Mass. 
Their  children  were : 

-|-     I.  Daniel,"  born  in  England,  163 1. 
+    II.  Samuel,^'  born  in  England,  1633. 

III.  Susanna,"  born  in  Cambridge,  June,  1637. 

IV.  Thomas,"  born  in  Cambridge  ;  died  Aug.  7,  1639, 

and  his  death  is  the  seventh  recorded  in  "  New- 
towne." 

Thomas'  died  in  1642,  and  by  his  will,  probated 
in  1643,  left  to  each  of  his  three  children /i 5. 
His  widow,  Susan,  married  Feb.  15,   1644,  James

Thompson,  of  Woburn,  Mass.  ;  and  the  daughter, 
Susanna,  married  Nov.  28,  1655,  Jonathan  Thomp- 
son, the  son  of  her  stepfather.     She  died  Oct.  20, 
1 69 1.     Her  oldest  son,  Jonathan,^  was  the  great- 
grandfather of  the  distinguished  philosopher,  Sir 
Benjamin  Thompson,  knighted  by  George  III,  and 
better  known  as  Count  Rumford,  with  which  title 
he  was   honored   by  the    King  of  Bavaria.     He 
was  born  at  Woburn,  March  26,  1753,  and  died 
at  Auteil,  near  Paris,  Aug.  21,  1814,  in  his  sixty- 
second  year. 

Their  children  were : 

1.  Susanna  Thompson,^  born  July  4,  1661. 

2.  Jonathan  Thompson,^  born  Sept.  28,  1663. 

3.  James  Thompson,^  born  1666;  "d.  soon." 

4.  James  Thompsons  (2c1),  born  June  22,  1667. 

5.  Sarah  Thompson,^  born  June  i,  1670. 

6.  Simon  Thompson,^  born  June  15,  1673. 

7.  Ebenezer  Thompson,^  born  Aug-.  18,  1676. 


DANIEL,^    THOMAS.' 


ANIEI/  the  eldest  child  of  Thomas 
and  Susan  Blogget,  was  born  in 
England  in  1631,  and  came  with 
his  parents  to  America  in  1635. 
The  family  settled  in  Cambridge 
(then  Newe  Towne),  where 
Thomas  the  father  died  in  1642,  and  early  in 
1644  the  mother  married  James  Thompson,  a 
prominent  citizen  of  Woburn,  Mass.,  and  it  seems 
a  natural  inference  that  her  sons  were  brought 
up  in  that  town,  although  it  appears  that  DanieP 
was,  1652,  made  a  freeman  in  Cambridge  and 
received  a  Land  Grant  of  40  acres,  in  the  division 
of  Shawshine  in  1652.* 

The  Plantation  of  Chelmsford,  Mass.,  was 
granted  May  18,  1653,  and  incorporated  May 
29.  1635.  The  first  petitioners  for  the  grant, 
twenty  in  number,  were  of  Concord  and  Woburn, 

*  Cambridge  Records. 


96  Asakel  Blodgett 

and  of  these  Daniel  Blogget  of  Wobiirn  was  one.* 
He  appears  to  have  settled  about  1654  in  the 
West  Precinct  of  Chelmsford,  which  was  set  off 
and  incorporated  as  the  town  of  Westford,  Sept. 
23,  1729.  Here  he  resided  until  his  death,  which 
occurred  (according  to  Savage)  Jan.  28,  1672. 
He  received  a  Land  Grant,  1652.  He  is  men- 
tioned in  the  History  of  Chelmsford  : — "  Daniel 
Bloggett  one  of  Committee  appointed  by  Select- 
men to  State  to  every  proprietor  in  the  new  field 

their  proportion  offence,  etc 12  ist  Month 

1666-7."  I"  ^659  he  had  four  acres  at  Little 
Tad  muck,  a  part  of  Chelmsford. f 

He  married,  first,  Sept.  15,  1653,  Mary,  daugh- 
ter of  Benjamin  Butterfield,J  who  died  Sept.  5, 
1666. 

Children,  born  in  Chelmsford  : 

-|-         L  Thomas,^  born  June  25,  1654;  assessed  1720- 
1721. 
n.  Anna,3  born  Nov.  2,  1655. 
III.  Daniel,3  born  Jan.  6,  1657. 
-|-      IV.  Benjamin,^   born  in    1658;  assessed   1720  to 

1732. 
+        V.  Jonathan,^  born  Sept.  18,  1660. § 

*  History  of  Westford.  t  Westford  Records. 

\  Chelmsford  Records  give  the  date  of  Daniel's-  marriage  as  1659, 
an  evident  error,  as  four  children  were  born  before  that  date.     It  should 

be  1653.     If  he   married  a   Mary in  1659,  it  would  mean  that  he 

was  married  three  times ;  but  as  each  of  the  first  two  wives  would  be  a 
Mary,  we  prefer  to  assume  that  the  date  1659  is  erroneous.

-|-     VI.  Samuel,^  born  Oct.  12,  1662. 

VII.  Nathaniel,^  born  Oct.  22,   1664;  died  Oct. 
27,  1666.* 

He  married,  second,  March  10,  1669,  Sarah, 
dauQfhter  of  William  Underwood.  Their  children 
were: 

-|-  VIII.  Nathaniel,^  born  March  16,  1670. 
-f-     IX.  William,^  born  probably  in  1672. 

The  death  of  DanieP  does  not  appear  in  the 
Chelmsford  Records.  The  Town  Clerk  writes : 
"  A  note  at  the  end  of  the  earliest  records  says 
that  when  this  copy  was  made  from  the  first 
'  Book  of  Records,'  in  many  places  it  was  torn  and 
defaced,  and  in  other  places  the  births  and  deaths 
wholly  lost,  so  that  all  could  not  be  perfectly 
transcribed."  This  may  account  for  some  names 
that  otherwise  could  be  found. 

Thomas^  {Daniel,^  Thomas^),  son  of  DanieP 
and  Mary  (Butterfield)  Blodgett,  born  in  Chelms- 
ford, June  25,  1654;  assessed  1720  to  1721.  He 
probably  died  March  30,  1741,  aged  87  years.f 
He  married  first,  "  29''^  4*'^  mo."  (June),  1682, 
Mary,  daughter  of  Joseph  Parkis,  of  Chelmsford, 
born  Aug.  10,  1657.  The  date  of  her  death  is 
uncertain  ;  Chelmsford  Recor^^s  say  Sept.  9,  1694,

Samuel^  (^Daniel,''  Thomas^'),  son  of  DanieP 
and  Mary  (Butterfield),  Blodgett,  born  in  Chelms- 
ford, Oct.  12,  1662.  The  only  subsequent  infor- 
mation is  derived  from  Savage,  who  says,  "  He 
died  at  Woburn  July  3,  1687,  "^"^^  Samuel  Blod- 
gett, of  Woburn,  was  appointed  administrator." 
This  administrator  may  have  been  either  his 
uncle  Samuel, ''  or  his  cousin  Samuel  ;^  there  are 
no  data  for  determining.  See  record  of  Samuel,^ 
of  Woburn,  on  page  113  below. 

Nathaniel^  (^Daniel,''  Thomas^),  son  of  DanieP 
and  Sarah  (Underwood)  Blodgett,  born  in  Chelms- 
ford, Mass.,  March  16,  1670;  married  July  17, 
1695,  Elizabeth  Warren  of  Chelmsford.  There  is 
no  record  of  assessment.  The  "  Early  History  of 
Hollis,  N.  H.,"  says : — "At  a  meeting  of  the  in- 
habitants of  the  West  Parish  in  Dunstable,  assem- 
bled January  18,  1742,  called  Mr.  Daniel  Emerson 
for  their  Gospel  minister,  etc.  Nathaniel  Blodgett 
was  one  of  the  signers." 

William^  {Daniel,'  Thomas'") ,  son  of  Daniel' 
and  probably  Sarah  (Underwood)  Blodgett.  His 
birth  is  not  recorded  in  Chelmsford  town  records, 
but  it  seems  probable  that  he  was  the  second 
child  of  DanieP  and  Sarah  his  second  wife.  That 
he  was  the  son  of  DanieP  is  beyond  reasonable 
doubt,  for  there  is  no  other  place  for  him.  He 
was    probably  born    about   1671   or   1672,  as    his 


And  His  Descendants  lOi 

father  DanieP  died,  according  to  Savage,  Jan.  28, 
1672.  In  Chelmsford  Tax  Lists  he  is  called  Dea. 
William  Blodgett,  and  was  assessed  from  1720  to 
1728,  indicating  that  he  died  about  the  latter  date. 
There  are  no  Tax  Lists  extant  prior  to  1720.  He 
married  June  14,  1696,  Mary  Warren  who  prob- 
bably  died  June  7,  1749.

Thomas,"  Jr.  {Thomas  ■&gt;  Daniel,'  Thomas'),  son 
of  Thomas^  and  probably  Mary  (Parkis)  Blodgett. 
This  lineage  is  beset  with  difficulties,  as  it  in- 
volves records  both  of  Chelmsford  and  Westford. 
Most  of  the  Blodgetts  lived  in  what  was  the  West 
Precinct  of  Chelmsford  until  it  was  set  off  as  the 
town  of  Westford  in  1729  ;  hence  the  record  is  in- 


*  See  Westford  Recs. 


102  Thomas  Blodzett 


&lt;s' 


complete,  as  it  is  partly  in  Chelmsford  and  partly 
in  Westford.  He  was  assessed  in  Chelmsford 
1720  to  1728.  There  is  no  record  of  his  birth  in 
either  town.  That  he  was  the  son  of  Thomas,^  is 
evident  from  the  fact  that  in  the  tax  lists  of  Chelms- 
ford the  father  is  designated  as  "  Senior,"  and  the 
son  as  "  Junior."  From  a  careful  study  of  all 
obtainable  facts,  the  compiler  concludes  that  he 
was  probably  the  oldest  son  of  Thomas,^  and  was 
born  about  1686  ;  this  assumed  date  is  fortified  by 
the  fact  of  his  wife's  birth  in  1686,  as  will  appear 
below.  The  record  of  his  marriage  is  :  "  Thomas 
Blodgett  and  Tabitha  Blanchard,  both  of  Chelms- 
ford, married  by  Justice  Minott,  Concord,  Sept. 
30,  1719." 

Their  children  were  probably  as  follows : — 

I.  Tabitha,5  born  "Jan.  y®  2d,  1719/20." 

II.  AbigaiLjS  born ;  probably  died  young. 

III.  Thomas,5    born   July    28 ;  baptized    Aug.    10, 
1729. 

He  is  thus  mentioned  in  the  History  of  West- 
ford  : 

"  Thomas*  Blodgett,  Jr.,  occupied  a  tract  of  40  acres  on 
the  west  side  of  Tadmuck  Hill.  He  lived  on  the  Heywood 
place,  and  died  1741." 

This  statement  of  his  death  is  erroneous  ;  it  was 
the  father,  Thomas,^  who  died  1741,  aged  %"] 
years.  Thomas,'*  Jr.,  probably  died  in  1730,  but 
his  death  does  not  appear  in  either  Chelmsford  or 


And  His  Descendants  103 

Westford  records.  His  will,  dated  May  16,  1730, 
approved  June  26,  1730,  is  recorded  in  "Middle- 
sex Wills,"  Book  19,  page  92.  In  it  he  mentions 
wife  Tabitha,  son  Thomas  under  2 1  years  of  age, 
daughter  Tabitha  and  daughter  Abigail ;  his  wife 
and  Deacon  John  Fletcher  were  executors.  There 
is  no  later  mention  of  him  in  the  tax  lists,  but  the 
widow  Tabitha  appears  subsequently  in  several, 
having  been  assessed  in  1730,  1732,  and  1735. 

Other  papers  on  file  with  his  will  show  that 
"Widow  Tabitha  died  March  i,  1764,  aged  about 
76  years,  and  that  said  widow  and  both  daughters 
were  under  guardianship  as  Non  Corns"  There 
is  no  further  information  concerning  the  son 
Thomas.' 

Joseph*  {Thomas,^  Daniel,''  Thomas'),  son  of 
Thomas'  and  Mary  (Parkis)  Blodgett,  was  born 
in  Chelmsford,  Mass.,  Oct.  10,  1689.*  About 
1710  he  removed  from  that  part  of  Chelmsford 
known  as  the  West  Precinct  (incorporated  as  the 
town  of  Westford,  1729),  to  that  part  of  Dun- 
stable which  in  1732  became  Nottingham,  and  in 
1 741,  Nottingham  West,  now  Hudson,  N.  H.,  a 
date  so  early  that  he  had  to  live  in  a  "  garrison  " 
for  protection  from  Indians.f 

The  date  of  his  marriage  is  not  known,  but  it  is 
probable  that  it  was  after  he  settled  in  Hudson, 

*  Chelmsford  Records.  t  See  Appendix  F,  p.  87,  supra. 


104  Thomas  Blodgett 

for  in  1 710  he  would  have  been  but  21  years  old, 
and  the  birth  of  his  oldest  child  indicates  that  he 
was  not  married  until  several  years  after  his  re- 
moval thither.  His  wife  was  Dorothy,  daughter 
of  Joseph  Perham,  born  July  9,  1696.  He  died 
Dec.  3,  1 76 1,  in  his  73d  year;  she  died  March  6, 
1778,  aged  82. 

There  is  difficulty  in  tabulating  the  children  of 
this  family ;  Hudson  Records  mention  the  birth 
of  but  two  daughters,  Dorothy  and  Rebecca,  but 
have  the  marriage  of  an  "  Abigail."  Mr.  Kimball 
Webster,  who  is  an  authority  on  Hudson  geneal- 
ogies, ventures  the  opinion  that  Dorothy  changed 
her  name  and  was  married  as  "Abigail."  The 
evidence  against  this  theory  is  too  long  to  be 
quoted  here,  but  the  family  tradition  that  there 
were  three  daughters,  is  so  clear,  direct  and  con- 
clusive, the  compiler  is  forced  to  adopt  that  view. 
It  simply  means  that  the  birth  of  one  daughter 
was  not  recorded,  an  omission  quite  too  common. 
Adopting  this  view,  the  record  of  his  family  may 
be  stated  as  follows.

JosiAH"  {^William,^  Daniel,^  Thomas,"^),  son  of 
William^  and  Mary  (Warren)  Blodgett,  was  born 
in  Chelmsford,  Mass.,  July  27,  1709,  but  his  sub- 
sequent record  is  found  in  Dunstable,  where 
there  is  frequent  mention  of  him. 

"  Josiah  Blodgett  protested  against  location  of  Meeting 
House." 

In  1743  he  was  "Dear  Reave  to  prevent  killing  of 
Dear  out  of  season." 

Josiah  Blodgett  is  one  "of  y^  14  in  account  of  y® 
names  of  y^  Fifteen  Highest  Payers  which  was  to  Draw 
y«  Pew  Ground  as  They  were  voted  By  y^  Second  Parish 
Dunstable  first  of  all."  [It  seems  they  built  their  own 
pews  on  ground  selected  as  above.] 

Josiah  Blodgett  was  on  a  Committee  "to  see  that  the 
minister  has  his  wood  by  Jan.  i,  1762  or  get  it  them- 
selves." 

In  1764  he  was  a  "Quirester  on  y^  Congregation"  (to 
set  the  tune).

Zacheus,^  as  this  is  the  only  instance  of  the  name.

In  Dunstable  Records  is  this  marriage  :  —  Lieut.  John 
Cheeney  and  Mrs.  Elizabeth  Blodgett,  July  6,  1777  ;  she 
must  have  been  of  5th  generation,  as  there  does  not  ap- 
pear to  have  been  any  of  6th  generation  of  marriageable 
age  in  Dunstable,  in  1777.  Was  she  daughter  of  Josiah* 
and  Jemima,  born  between  1737  and  1743?  There  ap- 
pears to  have  been  room  for  her.  It  would  follow  that 
she  was  first  wife  of  Lieut.  John  Chaney,  or  Cheeney, 
and  that  after  her  decease,  he  married  her  younger  sis- 
ter, Abigail.

at  the  siege  and  capture  of  Louisburg.

SAMUEW  THOMAS; 


AMUEL,-  son  of  Thomas'  and 
[^^  Susan  Blodgett,  was  born  in 
England,  1633,  '^^^  settled  at 
Wobnrn,  Mass.,  where  his  de- 
scendants became  numerous  and 
influential.  He  was  "  Deputy  to 
the  General  Court,  1693,"  "  Commissioner  of  the 
Rate,  1692,"  "  Selectman  i68r,  1690,  1691,  1693, 
1695,  1696,  1697,  1703."==' 

He  was  assessed  in  Woburn,  1666  to  1719,  and 
died  there  May  21,  1720,  aged  nearly  87  years. 
Savage  gives  his  death  July  3,  1693,  an  evident 
error,  as  he  was  assessed  until  17 19.  Woburn 
Records  have  the  death  of  Samuel  Blodgett,  July 
3,  1687,  but  this  was  probably  Samuel,'  son  of 
Daniel,'  of  Chelmsford,  who.  according  to  Savage, 
died  at  Woburn  July  3.  1687,  and  "  Samuel  Blod- 
gett of   Woburn   was    appointed    Administrator."

This  Samuel  may  have  been  his  uncle  (SamueP), 
or  his  cousin,  Samuel, =*  then  twenty-nine  years  old. 
The  only  objection  to  this  assumption  of  the  death 
of  Samuel,^  son  of  Daniel,^  in  Woburn,  is  that  it 
appears  to  be  the  only  instance  where  the  Chelms- 
ford (Daniel')  and  the  Woburn  (SamueP)  families 
fraternized 

It  is  a  curious  fact  (if  the  premises  are  correct), 
that,  with  this  single  exception,  the  entire  family 
of  Daniel'  lived  in  Chelmsford,  and  the  entire 
family  of  Samuel'  lived  in  Woburn,  yet  the  his- 
tories and  records  of  the  families  do  not  show  any 
affiliation. 

Paige,  in  his  "  History  of  Cambridge,"  makes 
the  death  of  Samuel,'  May  21,  1720,  aged  nearly 
87  ;  this  is  consistent  with  the  date  of  birth  and 
with  an  imperfect  record  of  a  death  in  Woburn  :  — 

"Blodgett,  s.  of ,  May  21,  1720."

she  must  have  been  the  daughter  of  Samuel,^

by  her  marriage  she  was  probably  born  be-

1664.  In  "  Middlesex  Marriages,  Births  and 
Deaths,"  her  name  is  given  as  Hannah  when 
married,  but  her  birth  is  not  stated.  She 
appears  to  have  had  a  daughter  Sarah, ^  who 
married  Samuel  Wilson,  and  after  his  death 
married  Feb.  19,  1755,  Deacon  Edward  John-

And  His  Descendants  1 19 

Thomas^  appears  to  have  been  assessed  in  Wo- 
burn  from  1684  to  1689.  Although  he  removed 
to  Lexington  some  years  earHer,  his  first  assess- 
ment in  that  town  was  in  1691.  He  was  the 
ancestor  of  the  greater  part  of  the  Lexington 
Blodgetts,  and  one  of  the  most  active  and  prom- 
inent citizens.  Capt.  Blodgett,  as  he  was  famil- 
iarly called,  was  a  subscriber  to  the  meeting-house 
in  the  Precinct  in  1692.  He  and  his  wife  were 
added  to  the  church  March  5,  1699,  by  a  letter 
of  dismissal  from  the  Woburn  church.  He  was  an 
assessor  in  17 10,  and  after  the  incorporation  of 
the  town  he  filled  nearly  every  place  of  honor  and 
trust,  in  1 7 14,  he  was  chosen  one  of  the  select- 
men, an  office  to  which  he  was  afterward  re- 
elected. He  also  represented  the  town  in  the 
General  Court. 

Among  the  town  offices  was  that  of  tything- 
man,  then  regarded  as  of  the  first  moment. 
Often  the  leading  men  of  the  town,  the  best  and 
most  worthy,  were  elected  to  that  office,  it  being 
esteemed  as  of  even  more  dignity  than  that  of 
selectman.  At  the  first  town  meeting  Thomas 
Blodgett  was  elected  tythingman. 

He  lived  on  Adams  Street,  near  the  intersec- 
tion of  North  Street.  It  is  recorded  in  Hud.son's 
"  History  of  Lexington,"  that  he  gave  i  pound, 
10  shillings,  towards  the  first  meeting-house,  and 
5  shillings  towards  the  purchase  of  Lexington 
Common,  at  a  meeting  held  April,  171 1.     At  an-

other  meeting,  Jan.  9,  17 13,  it  was  voted  to  build 
a  new  church  on  the  plan  of  the  one  at  Concord, 
and  Thomas  Blodgett  and  four  others  were  ap- 
pointed to  carry  the  measure  into  effect. 

In  Hudson's  "  History  of  Lexington,"  the  death 
of  the  wife  Rebecca  is  given  as  July  3,  17 16; 
but  Paige's  "History  of  Cambridge"  says,  "In 
Thomas's^  will,  made  Oct.  26,  1738,  his  wife  Re- 
becca and  all  his  children  except  Ruth  are  men- 
tioned," and  this  makes  it  clear  that  the  Lexing- 
ton record  of  her  death  in  17 16  is  erroneous. 

The  will  of  Thomas^  Bloggett  was  hied  in  the 
Probate  Office  Oct.  27,  1740,  approved  Nov. 
24,  1740,  and  is  recorded  with  Middlesex  Wills, 
Book  22,  page  34:  it  mentions  wife  Rebecca;  son 
Thomas  ;  son  Joseph,  who  had  /20  extra ;  son 
Samuel;  daughter  Rebekah  Russell,  who  had  £\o 
extra  and  daughter  Abigail  Reed.  Sons  Thomas 
and  Samuel  had  extra.  Other  papers  on  file  with 
the  will  show  that  Abigail's  husband  was  Peter 
Reed. 


Samuel^  {Samuels  Samuel^  Thomas'),  son  of 
Samuel,^  Jr.,  and  Huldah  (Simonds)  Blodgett,  was 
born  in  Woburn,  Mass.,  Dec.  2,  1683,  and  died  at 
Stafford,  Conn.,  Dec.  12,  1762.  His  marriage  is 
not  recorded  in  Woburn,  but  in  the  record  of 
Births  there,  are  the  following  children  of  Samuel 
and  Lydia  Blodgett :

V.  A  SoN,s  name  not  ascertained,  born  at  Stafford 
about  1 72 1. 

In  VVoburn  tax  lists,  Samueh  is  called  Samuel 
Tertius,  and  after  the  death  of  his  father,  Samuel, 
Jr.  He  was  assessed  in  Woburn,  1704  to  17 19. 
About  the  latter  date  he  and  his  brothers,  Daniel, 
Joshua,  and  Josiah,  removed  to  Stafford,  Conn., 
and  their  subsequent  lineage  must  be  traced  in 
that  town. 

Stafford  was  surveyed  in  1718,  and  its  settle- 
ment was  begun  in  the  spring  of  1719.  Among 
the  earliest  settlers  were  four  brothers  from  Wo- 
burn, viz.  ;  Samuel,  Daniel,  Joshua  and  Josiah 
Blodgett  (or  Blogget,  as  it  was  then  spelled), 
sons  of  Samuel^  and  Huldah  (Simonds)  Blodgett. 
The  family  became  very  numerous  in  Stafford. 
They  went  thence  to  Monson,  Mass.,  to  Ran- 
dolph, Vt.,  Claremont,  N.  H.,  Lebanon,  N.  H., 
Chelsea,  Vt.,  etc. 

In  Hinman's  "  Early  Puritan  Settlers  of  Con- 
necticut "  there  is  no  mention  of  Samuel,  the 
eldest  brother,  whose  removal  to  Stafford  is  per- 
fectly clear,  but  he  does  mention  Paul  and  "  Ben-

means  Benjamin,^  a  younger  brother  of  the  four 
above  named,  born  March  4,  1701.  He  may 
have  gone  to  Stafford  for  a  few  years,  but  if  so, 
he  returned  to  Woburn,  where  he  was  assessed 
1729  to  1763.  Hinman  is  clumsy  in  expression 
and  arransfement.

it  does  not  appear  in  Woburn  Records,  although 
his  marriage  and  the  births  of  his  children  are 
recorded  there.  He  married  April  4,  1 709,  Mary 
Mallet."^  He  was  assessed  in  Woburn  1707  to 
1712,  but  after  the  latter  date  he  does  not  appear 
in  the  Woburn  Records.  He  removed  to  Stafford, 
Conn.,  about  1719;  died  there  Dec.  15,  1762.

appears  to  have  served  in  the  expedition  to 
Canada  during  the  summer  of  1709,  as  his  father 
"  Samuel  Blogget  of  Wobourn  "  petitioned  "  The 
Governor,  Her  Majesties  Counsell  and  Represen-

fore  1721.  He  was  highly  approved  of  as  a  physician  in 
Plainfield  and  Canterbury,  and  in  172 1  he  applied  to  the 
General  Court  for  license  to  practice  medicine,  with  full 
proof  of  his  good  moral  character,  and  the  satisfaction  of 
the  people  of  the  towns  aforesaid,  of  his  skill  and  success ; 
but  his  petition  was  negatived  on  the  ground  that  he  was 
illiterate,  and  should  not  be  received  with  the  members  of 
any  learned  profession  —  [meaning,  probably,  that  he  had 
not  had  a  collegiate  education]. 

He  is  mentioned  as  of  Plainfield  in  a  transfer 
of  real  estate  in  1 7 1 9  :  — 

William  Blogget,  physician,  and  Sarah  his  wife  of  Plain- 
field  convey  to  Henry  Cob  of  Plainfield  land  in  Plainfield 
commonly  called  Tophet,  April  30,  17x9- 

He  is  also  mentioned  as  of  Plainfield  in  real 
estate  transfers  in  1724,  1726,  1731,  1736.  He 
later  appears  to  have  lived  in  Boston,  as  Town

conveys  to  William  Blogget,  Jun.,  his  son,  160 
acres  of  land  in  Preston.  He  appears  to  have 
died  in  Preston,  1750  or  1751,  as  shown  by  va- 
rious records  relatino-  to  the  settlement  of  his 
estate.

Stephen  Hall,  of  Concord  and  Stow,  and  sister 
of  Lieut.  John  Hall,  of  Plainfield,  which  explains 
why  he  settled  there.  In  the  distribution  of  the 
estate  of  Lieut.  John  Hall,  a  share  went  to  "  Sarah 
Blogget,  youngest  sister,  March  28,  1727." 

Thomas  Stevens  as  Attorney  for  William  Blogget  and  his

Children  : 

\.  WiLLiAM,5   born   ;    he  married  probably 

Mary  Starkweather,  for  in  "  Connecticut 
Marriages  "  the  following  record  is  found : 
"Wm.  Blogct  and  Mary  Starkweather  of 
Preston-Griswold,  June  23"  [prob.  1738]. 
"She  died  April  4,  1785,  in  the  71st  year 
of  her  age."t  This  would  make  her  birth 
171  5  ;  the  natural  inference  is  that  the  hus- 
band, William,5  was  born  as  early  as  171 5, 
and  this  is  consistent  with  the  birth  of  his 
brother  Benjamin,  which  is  of  record  May 
17,  1 71 7.  He  administered  on  his  father's 
estate   1752.

The  above  are  all  the  children  of  whom  men- 
tion has  been  found,  but  perhaps  there  were  others. 
As  to  the  daughters,  there  are  no  dates  of  births, 
and  no  data  to  establish  their  order.  The  above 
tabulation  is  therefore  conjectural. 

Caleb^  {^Samuel,^  Samuel,^  Thomas'),  son  of 
Samuel,5  Jr.,  and  Huldah  (Simonds)  Bloclgett. 
was  born  in  Woburn,  Mass.,  Nov.  11,  1691,  and 


And  His  Descendants  127 

died  June  17,  1745.  He  was  an  innholder,  and 
was  designated  as  "  Capt."  and  "Mr.,"  both  titles 
of  respect.  He  was  assessed  1712  to  1744.  In 
1739  the  "  Proprietors"  met  at  his  house,  and  he 
was  moderator  of  "Proprietors'  meetings,"  1739- 

1743.  In  1744  he  was  Proprietors'  clerk.  There 
is  a  little  uncertainty  about  his  marriages.  Ac- 
cording to  Wyman's  "  Genealogies  and  Estates  of 
Charlestown,"  he  married,  first,  Sarah  Wyman, 
born  Jan.  17,  1690/ 1,  by  whom  there  were:

He  appears  to  have   married,  second,  Aug.  7, 

1744,  Elizabeth  Wyman,  a  second  cousin  of  his 
first  wife,  Sarah,  by  whom  he  had  : 

V.  Elizabeth,*  born  Oct.  27,  1744. 

But  in  Woburn  Records,  in  a  list  of  "  Epitaphs

128  Thomas  Blodgett 

So  far  as  appears  there  was  but  one  Caleb  Blog- 
get  to  whom  this  could  apply, —  namely  Caleb/ 
whose  lineage  we  are  considering.  At  the  time 
of  Elizabeth's  death,  "aged  about  22  years," 
Caleb'  was  not  quite  twenty-two  years  old ;  it 
therefore  means  an  early  marriage  and  an  early 
bereavement ;  no  other  explanation  seems  pos- 
sible to  the  present  compiler.  If  the  graveyard 
epitaph  is  correct,  it  indicates  that  there  was  a 
wife  Elizabeth,  who  died  in  17 13,  aged  about  22 
years ;  that  his  second  wife  was  Sarah  Wyman. 
and  his  third  wife  was  Elizabeth  Wyman. 

In  Woburn  Records,  1745,  is  mention  of  Widow 
Elizabeth  Blodgett,  Innholder. 

Joshua^  {^Samuel:  Samuel,^  Thomas'^,  son  of 
Samuel,^  Jr.,  and  Huldah  (Simonds)  Blodgett,

was  assessed  there  17 15  to  17 19,  and  married 
Dinah,  probably  daughter  of  John  and  Dinah 
(Knight)  Morse,  of  Watertown,  Mass.  About 
1 7 19  he  went  to  Stafford,  Conn.  (See  lineage  of

was  assessed  at  Woburn,  1716-19,  and  was  one 
of  the  original  proprietors  and  settlers  of  Staf- 
ford, Conn.,  whither  he  went  about  17 19.  (See 
lineage  of  Samuel.'')  He  appears  to  have  mar- 
ried before  the  removal,  as  the  birth  of  his  first 
child  is  recorded  at  Woburn.  "  He  and  his  bro- 
ther Daniel  built  the  old  dam  at  the  Furnace." 
He  died  at  Stafford,  1756;  the  inventory  of  his 
estate' was  about  ^160.  Hinman  gives  his  wife's 
name  as  Margaret,  which  is  probably  erroneous, 
for  both  Woburn  and  Stafford  records  have  the 
name  of  the  mother  of  his  children  as  Elizabeth  ; 
her  family  name  has  not  been  ascertained,  as 
there  is  no  record  of  his  marriage.

Benjamin^  (^Samuel,"'  Samuel,''  Thomas^'),  son 
of  Samuel,^  Jr,,  and  Huldah  (Simonds)  Blod- 
gett, was  born  in  Woburn,  Mass.,  March  4,  1701, 
and  assessed  there  1729-30,  1732-4,  1737-63. 
His  life  appears  to  have  been  spent  in  Woburn, 
at  least  until  he  was  62  years  of  age,  but  there  is 
no  record  of  marriage,  children  or  death.  There 
is  in  1745,  in  Proceedings  of  Proprietors,  this  men- 
tion of  Benjamin  Blodgett:  "To  see  if  Proprie- 
tors will  grant  or  sell  him  site  for  Smiths  Shop, 
etc."  And  in  Record  of  Deaths  is :  "  Widow  of 
Benjamin  (Blodgett)  of  old  age,  Sept.  i,  1801." 

As  no  other  Benjamin  appears  in  Woburn  Rec- 
ords these  items  may  refer  to  him.

removed  to  the  neighboring  town  of  Lexington, 
where  he  seems  to  have  resided  until  he  was 
about  thirty-five  years  of  age,  but  no  record  of 
assessment  in  Lexintrton  has  been  found,  nor  in 
Woburn.  He  married,  first,  Nov.  5,  17 19,  Sarah 
Stone,  born  in  Lexington,  Nov.  7,  1700.  She 
was  admitted  to  the  church  in  Lexington,  June 
19,  1728.  They  removed  to  Brimfield,  Mass., 
where  he  appears  to  have  been  a  prominent  citi- 
zen. He  was  one  of  the  original  members  of  the 
church  there  in  1724.  In  1736  he  was  on  the 
"  committee  to  treat  with  minister  relating  to  his 
principles  and  all  soe,  relating  to  y^  proposals  made 
by  y^  town  in  order  to  settlement  &amp;  sallery."  In
