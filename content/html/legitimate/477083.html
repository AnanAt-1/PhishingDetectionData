      <p><b>Summary</b>: There is no federal law in the U.S. requiring bicycle helmets. The states and localities below began
      adopting laws in 1987. Most are limited to children under 18, but there are 49 all-ages laws, broken out on <a href=
      "allageshelmetlaws.htm">our all-ages page</a>. At present, 22 States including the District of Columbia have state-wide
      laws, and more than 200 localities have local ordinances. Riders of electric bikes are required to wear helmets in some
      states <a href="https://helmets.org/ebikelaws.htm">listed on this ebike page in detail</a> and noted below. More info on
      helmet laws follows the list.<br>

      <p>State and local helmet laws now apply in states that include more than half of the total population of the US, but
      actually a much smaller portion of the population is covered, less than 15 per cent, due to age limitations of the laws.
      Laws have been proposed and may be either defeated or in some stage of the legislative process in a number of other
      states. In 2020 that includes at least Kentucky. And a proposed NY State law targeted at New York City would require
      helmets for every rider on a bicycle, e-bike or e-scooter in a city with a population over 1 million.<br>

      Consumer Product Safety Commission staffer Greg Rodgers has published <a href="briefs.htm#rodgers_state_laws">a study

      New York State reported that since it introduced its first helmet law in 1989 for passengers under 5, and its second in
      1994 for riders under 14, the annual rate of cyclists hospitalized from bicycle-related traumatic brain injuries fell for
      the under 14 group from 464 in 1990 to 209 in 1995. The rate for cyclists 14 and over for the same years declined less
      rapidly, from 454 to 382. There is no way to determine exactly what proportion of the improvement was due to helmet laws,
      since there is no data on improvements to bicycle facility safety, rider education or total miles ridden in those years,
      and helmet promotion campaigns by Safe Kids Worldwide and others were active in the state. But it is likely that
      increased helmet use, prompted by passage of the first law in 1989 and the promotion campaigns in New York communities,
      played a role in the reduction of injuries.<br>
      <br>
      New Jersey reported in July of 1997 that since it introduced a helmet law for kids under 14 the number of bicycle-related
      fatalities for that group fell by 60 per cent, from 41 in 1987-1991 to 16 in 1992-1997. For riders age 14 and over the
      figures were 75 and 71. The School Board of Sommers Point, NJ added a helmet rule and boosted helmet use by those who
      ride to school from 6 per cent up to more than 70 per cent. Their attorney thought that failure to require helmets could
      leave the School District liable in the event of an injury.<br>
      <br>
      Duval County, Florida, reported an increase in helmet use by all ages from 19 per cent in 1996 to 47 per cent in 1997
      after the Florida law was passed. Bicycle deaths fell from five to one, and injuries from 325 to 105. Results were even
      better in the age group covered by the law. Hillsborough County, Florida, also reports <a href=
      "https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/9/2/177.abstract">an increase in helmet use and a decline in injuries</a> after
      passage of the same law.<br>

      A study done in North Carolina using actual field observation before (1999) and after (2002) their law covering kids
      under 16 passed showed a small increase in adult helmet use but no increase for kids covered by the law. Overall
      on-street NC helmet use went from 18% to 24%, with larger gains among mountain bikers. The study concluded that
      "statistical analyses indicate that the law failed to generate a differential increase in helmet use by children ages
      zero to 15 years, mandated to wear helmets, compared with those ages 16 and above and not covered by the law. Although
      the difference in helmet use between surveys (1999 pre-law and 2002 post-law) was significant, it is clear that the
      helmet requirement has had little effect on increasing helmet use by children thus far." As far as we know they have not
      updated the study since 2002.<br>
      <br>
      A study published in <i>Pediatrics</i> in 2002 found that in Canada the bicycle-related head injury rate declined
      significantly (45% reduction) in provinces where legislation had been adopted compared with provinces and territories
      that did not adopt legislation (27% reduction). <a href=
      "https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/16/4/219.abstract?sid=ae6fb749-4be3-4f3b-a2ee-f71c2b4b885d">A 2010 Canadian
      study</a> showed that bicycle usage remained constant after helmet laws were adopted in two provinces, and that helmet
      use was increased more by all-ages laws than those applying only to children.<br>
      <br>
      A study of California statistics by Lee et al published in <i>Accident Analysis & Prevention</i> in 2005 shows that head
      injuries in the under-16 group covered by the law went down by 18.2 per cent in California after the state helmet law was
      passed. There was no change in adult head injury rates.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w15658/w15658.pdf">This statistical analysis</a> concludes that
      passing a state-wide bicycle helmet law covering youth riders reduces cycling by those who are covered by the law by 4 to
      5 per cent. We note a number of problems with the data they used, but are still concerned about the conclusion. No actual
      rider counts have ever shown that result anywhere in the US.</p>
      <p class="h4" id="tacoma">Notes<br>
<br>
      </p>Tacoma, Washington, repealed their all-ages law in 2020. The repeal was part of a major
      overhaul of their city's micro-transportation environment. An article in the <i>News Tribune</i> had background. In 2019, the Tacoma Police Department handed out 12 citations
      for people not wearing a helmet.<br>
      <br>
      The National Survey of Bicyclist and Pedestrian Attitudes and Behavior, a Gallup
      poll sponsored by the US Government, found that 90% of cyclists support helmet laws for children, while 62 percent
      support such laws for adults. (Here is <a href="nhtsasurveyextract.pdf">an excerpt from the study with details</a>.)<br>
      <br>
      The Spokane law was passed by the City Council over the Mayor's veto. The Mayor wanted to delay, reduce coverage to those
      16 and under, not cover skateboarders or inline skaters and coordinate with neighboring jurisdictions. The Council vote
      was 5-1 with one absent. Here is <a href=
      "https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2004/jul/16/lack-of-logic-in-helmet-law-a-big-headache/">a columnist in the local
      newspaper who agreed with the action.</a> In April 2019 the City Council exempted people riding electric scooters rented
      through smartphone apps.<br>
      <br>
      The Shaker Heights, Ohio, law covers adults but not kids under the age of 5 years. It does cover passengers on bicycles,
      however. The Austin, Texas, law was originally for all ages, but a grass-roots protest movement resulted in limiting it
      in October, 1997, to riders under 18. A similar change was made in Barrington, Illinois. Seymour, Connecticut, repealed
      its law. (The referendum also included an unpopular no-smoking law.) An attempt in 1999 to force a referendum on the
      Farmington Hills, Michigan, law for riders under 16 failed for lack of signatures.<br>
      <br>
      El Cerrito, California, dropped its 1993 all-ages law in 2013, noting that the 1994 California State statute takes
      precedence. In 2015 there was a California State Senate
      bill that would have expanded their law to cover all ages, skateboards, non-motorized scooters and more.<br>
      <br>
      The Dallas all-ages law was changed in June, 2014 after 18 years and now applies only to riders under 18. The impetus was
      the establishment of a shared bicycle program, whose promoters believed a strictly-enforced all-ages law would severely
      restrict their program. A local newspaper reported that the majority of the citations had been handed out in poor,
      minority neighborhoods, leading to charges that the law was not evenly applied. A
      <i>Dallas News</i> article showed that few citations had been handed out to younger riders.<br>
      <br>
      The City of Oakwood, Ohio, has taken an different route by adopting a resolution encouraging the use of helmets. It
      directs the Safety Department (Police) to develop educational programs for helmet safety. It also provides the authority
      for officers to "wave over" minor cyclists who are not using protective head gear. No fines or other deterrents are
      permissible as this is not an ordinance, but a "soft mandate."<br>
      <br id="kingco">
      King County, Washington, mounted a comprehensive safety program with many elements, including their all-ages helmet law.
      They brought their child deaths down by 62 percent over a nine year period. But in 2022 they decided to repeal the law,
      just two years after Tacoma had done so. The reason: data showed that enforcement had been minimal and had
      disproportionately affected people of color and people experiencing homelessness. The Metropolitan King County Council
      has budgeted more than $200,000 to buy helmets and expand education.<br>
      <br>
      Many bicycle clubs, the <a href="https://usacycling.org:443/">US racer's organizing body, USA Cycling</a> and the
      Triathlon Federation require helmets in their events, although they may or may not support helmet laws. Touring
      organizations like <a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/">Adventure Cycling</a> usually require them for organized
      tour riders. U.S. military regulations require helmets on military facilities. The National Bicycle Dealers Association
      opposes mandatory helmet laws. <i>Bicycle Retailer and Industry News</i> has editorialized against them.

     There are mandatory helmet laws in Argentina, Australia, Austria, most of

      Lithuania, Malta, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, United Arab Emirates and
      parts of the United States. In 2017 a new review of their effects was reportedly being undertaken at the University of

      In Australia, bicycle helmets are mandatory in all states and territories for all ages. Compliance is high but varies by
      area, with some cities over 90% and rural areas much lower. In the State of Victoria cyclists' head injuries declined
      41%. There were 36% fewer child riders on the road, immediately after the legislation passed, but perhaps more adult
      riders. Changes in ridership may or may not have been related to the passage of the laws, and the road culture in
      Australia is unique to that country. (No similar effects have ever been documented in the US.) Injury reduction was below
      expectations, but still spectacular. Hospital data from Western Australia showed that the number of intracranial injuries
      was cut in half with increased helmet use, while head injuries were less serious, and hospital stays shorter. There is
      more analysis in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21819836/">this journal article</a> and

      as their main concerns, with about 16% saying helmets deter them, ranking number 13 in the list. In 2011 a film maker in
      Brisbane produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=2ZNLb_SBbuA">this anti-helmet law

      repeal the Queensland law. In 2012 a study of long term bicycle related head injury trends for New South Wales found
      indicators that cycling had increased and head injuries had dropped over time. Posting comments on <a href=
      "https://www.crikey.com.au/">this blog</a> the critics continued to debate. In 2016 Canberra announced they would study
      the possibility of relaxing their helmet law for "parks, town centres and other low-speed environments such as shared
      zones and university precincts" in an effort to increase ridership. <br>

      New Zealand's national helmet law took effect in January, 1994.  A study showed that although

      In some European countries, cycle helmets have become mandatory in the last few years. In Malta, cycle helmets became
      mandatory for all cyclists in April 2004. In Sweden, cycle helmets became mandatory for children up to 15 years of age on
      January 1st 2005. The same group of cyclists has to wear helmets in Slovenia and the Czech Republic. In Spain, cyclists
      have to wear a helmet outside urban areas except when going uphill.<br>
      <br>
      The Swedish government conducted an international literature search, summarized in a study published in 2003. They found
      that helmet laws can achieve levels of usage not achieved by education alone, that helmet laws reduce head injuries, and
      that helmet laws can result in a reduction of cycling by young people. <br>

      Iceland's mandatory helmet rule, a ministerial decree covering children under 15, came into effect in September of

      The British Medical Association examined the evidence and <a href="bmareport.htm">recommended in 2004</a> that the UK
      adopt a mandatory helmet law for both children and adults. They had previously recognized the benefits of helmet use but
      had feared that a helmet law might reduce cycling, resulting in negative net health benefits. That same argument led
      readers polled by the BMA's magazine to <a href="bmjpoll.htm">vote against helmet laws</a> in 2011. In 2010 Jersey was
      considering a new law that would require helmets for riders under 18, having rejected a proposal for an all-ages law. The
      UK's Transport Research Laboratory has published <a href="https://trl.co.uk/uploads/trl/documents/PPR446_new.pdf">a paper on the effectiveness
      of helmets</a>. It found that in 2008, 34 per cent of riders in the UK were already wearing helmets on major roads, and
      17 per cent on minor roads. In a 2011 poll of 4000 cyclists conducted by the non-profit IAM, ten percent of the
      respondents said they would quit cycling if a mandatory helmet law were enacted.<br>
      <br>
      The Copenhagen Post reported in November, 2009 that a failed attempt to pass a Danish law requiring helmets for those
      under 12 was being revived after evidence surfaced that the proportion of Danish cyclists arriving at emergency rooms
      with head injuries was declining as helmet use there has increased to about one in six cyclists.<br>
      <br>
      In 2011 Switzerland considered a helmet law as part of a package to reduce road deaths, but the Transportation Committee
      of the National Council rejected the recommendation.<br>
      <br>
      Canada has provincial and local helmet laws. Ontario's helmet law for cyclists under 18 took effect in 1995. It was
      originally to have covered all ages, and there is a bill in parliament now to extend it to do that. There is spirited
      opposition by a few cyclists there. (see links below) Proponents cite the cost of cyclists' injuries to the national
      health system, without reference to the much greater cost of treating those injured in cars, a blind spot also found in
      the US. In March, 2003, the Canadian Institute for Health Information announced that hospitalizations due to
      cycling-related injuries were down 12.5 per cent between 1997-98 and 2001-02. Head injuries fell even more precipitously,
      by 26 per cent during the same period. British Columbia's 1996 all-ages law was very successful in increasing helmet use,
      according to <a href=
      "https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/5551">
      an evaluation project for this law</a> conducted by the University of North Carolina. It showed substantial increases in
      helmet use after the law was passed. There are exceptions to the law for medical exemptions, those with heads larger than
      size 8 (manufacturers had not yet begun producing the extra large helmets available today) and those whose religion
      requires headgear that makes helmets impossible (primarily Sikhs). Nova Scotia's law came into effect in 1997 and covers
      all ages. New Brunswick also has an all-ages law. In Quebec, the Montreal suburbs of Cote Saint-Luc and Westmount have
      passed by-laws requiring the use of bicycle helmets within their boundaries. In October, 1997, the Cote Saint-Luc law was
      extended to cover bicyclists and skaters of all ages. Alberta added a law on May 1, 2002, requiring helmets for riders
      under 18, including passengers and toddlers on tricycles. Prince Edward Island's law was effective on July 5, 2003, and
      covers all ages. A <a href=

      research project in Toronto</a> before and after their law came into effect showed that "although the number of child
      cyclists per hour was significantly different in different years, these differences could not be attributed to
      legislation. In 1996, the year after legislation came into effect, average cycling levels were higher (6.84 cyclists per
      hour) than in 1995, the year before legislation (4.33 cyclists per hour)." Conclusion: Contrary to the findings in
      Australia, the introduction of helmet legislation did not have a significant negative impact on child cycling in this
      community. Manitoba's under-18 helmet law came into effect in 2013. They will permit first-time offenders to avoid a fine
      by taking an on-line bike safety quiz. A 2015 law in Newfoundland and Labrador required all cyclists of any age to wear a
      helmet. In 2021 only two provinces, Saskatchewan and Quebec, do not have mandatory helmet laws.<br>

      Spain adopted a mandatory helmet law for cycling outside of cities in 2004. Helmets are not compulsory in towns and may

      France has a lively discussion on helmets going on. The best summary is probably <a href=
      "https://mdb-idf.org/le-casque-utile-indispensable-obligatoire/">this page on the Mieux se D&#233;placer &#229;
      Bicyclette site</a>. They analyze deaths in Paris and in France as a whole and conclude that helmet usage is a personal
      question but can save lives. In 2017 a French law went into effect requiring helmets for anyone under 12 years old, with
      a fine of &#8364;135 for an adult carrying a child on their bike without a helmet or accompanying a child who is cycling
      without one.<br>
      <br>
      The Netherlands has a similar discussion, <a href=
      "https://www.dutchnews.nl/2015/02/safety-researchers-recommend-bike-helmets-for-children-elderly/">focusing
      primarily on children and seniors</a>. Helmet laws would be a big step for a country as bike-centric as the Netherlands,
      where cycling has been made safer by meticulous attention to road facilities, legal structure that places all blame on a
      motorist in a crash and by high volumes of riders. A
      study published in 2020 by van den Brand et al concluded: "In this study we found that patients with TBI due to
      bicycle accidents did not wear helmets as often as a comparable control group. This association could not be established
      for patients with TBI as a result of a collision between a bicycle and a motorized vehicle. This study has some
      limitations, but the results strongly suggest that TBI in adult cyclists could be reduced if cyclists in the Netherlands
      would wear a helmet more often. Future research should focus on establishing the exact frequency of bicycle helmet use in
      the Netherlands and ways to promote helmet use without discouraging cycling."<br>

      Germany examined the question of a mandatory helmet law in 2023 and reportedly decided not to pursue it.

      Shinbun</i> article reported that 76 per cent of the surveyed parents of kids 1 to 6 years old had bought helmets for
      their kids, but only 54 per cent said the kids always wear them. <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20221220/p2a/00m/0na/067000c">A  2023 law</a> requires all riders of all ages to use helmets, or at least says: “Cyclists must make an effort to wear a helmet.” The government found that in a crash unhelmeted riders were about twice as likely to die as helmeted riders. There will be no punishment for failure to observe the law. There are reports of new helmets being marketed in Japan as a result of the law.<br>

      Mexico City briefly adopted a mandatory helmet law, but an article on the European Bicycle Federation

      In April of 2003 the <a href="https://www.uci.org/">Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI)</a> announced that it intended to
      make helmet use compulsory in the professional races it sanctions. The ruling has stuck this time (in 1991 an compulsory
      helmet rule was rejected by the riders). It followed several well-publicized deaths, including that of Kazakh rider
      Andrei Kivilev. Kivilev died of a head injury without a helmet. The impetus for the ruling had also grown since a
      helmeted rider fell on a turn at an intersection in a rainy Dutch stage of the Tour de France and hit his head on a
      concrete bollard in the center of the road, but to the astonishment of the crowd got up and raced away. In 2004 the UCI
      even extended its requirement for impact protection to the teardrop-shaped "chrono" helmets the riders use in time trials
      for better aerodynamics. The rule initially had an exemption for elite riders in climbs of more than 5 km. The <a href=

      <h4>Our View</h4><br>
      	The Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute supports carefully drawn mandatory helmet laws covering all age
      groups because we believe they are needed to raise awareness that helmets save lives, in the same way that seatbelt laws
      and smoke detector requirements were used to inform the public that those safety devices were necessary. Many riders and
      parents do not know that they need a helmet, and the laws educate as much as they force compliance. We also believe that
      most riders regard helmets as a fashion item rather than as a safety appliance, and like any other fashion this one may
      wane. We support efforts like Vision Zero to improve the safety of the cycling environment to reduce the need for helmets, and that should always be regarded as the primary injury prevention measure for reducing all injuries to cyclists. We would include safety education for both riders and car drivers as an important element of that effort.  We do not believe that
      wearing a helmet causes riders to take additional risks. We believe that in this country promoting helmets will not
      detract from the effort to improve road safety, and in fact has stimulated those efforts, giving us the most widespread
      and best-supported campaigns for better road safety for cyclists that we have ever had in our history. We are keenly
      aware that increasing riders may reduce injury rates, but we do not believe that helmets discourage cycling in
      the US. Since bicycles on a public road are vehicles, we believe that the operator has the rights and obligations of
      vehicle users in our ever-more-populated and outrageously unsafe road environment, so requiring a bicycle helmet is as
      reasonable as requiring a helmet on a motorcycle rider or requiring seatbelt usage in cars. We would support provisions
      for medical exemptions based on a doctor's certification or <a href="turbans.htm">religious requirements for
      headgear</a>.<br>
      <br>
      We have always been a lot more enthusiastic about promoting voluntary use of helmets than promoting laws, and it would
      appear from the list above that most U.S. states and localities are too. Even seatbelt laws that have been around for a
      long time are mostly secondary offense laws limiting enforcement to occasions when a driver has been stopped for
      something else. But those laws have saved millions of lives. Helmet laws can be useful, but given the problems with enforcing them they will probably not work well in
      most places until more riders have accepted the need for wearing a helmet. So we favor a stronger push for voluntary
      usage than for passing new helmet laws, and our website has always reflected that attitude.<br>
      <br>
      At present the pace of new helmet laws has slowed to almost zero. Attempts to extend laws to cover adults have been
      unsuccessful. Urban riders are increasingly questioning the need for helmets, and certainly the need for helmet laws.
      WABA, our parent organization, has taken a position opposing the extension of the Maryland state helmet law to adults. A
      pendulum is swinging. We expect it to swing back eventually as injuries show up, but the positive experience with shared
      bicycle programs has raised basic questions about the need for helmets, and younger riders are reconsidering. We regard
      all that as a fashion trend and remain convinced that bike riders need helmets.<br>
      <br>
      We do not participate in the endless Internet "Helmet Wars," among a small group of posters in blogs and social media,
      but we have a <a href="negativs.htm">web page up discussing some of the recurring points</a>.<br>

<li>A Systematic Review of Bicycle Helmet Laws Enacted Worldwide is a 2018 study of helmets laws done at Australia's UNSW Sidney. This link is to the full text .pdf file. The summary: "There are currently 28 countries in total that have a bicycle helmet law. When the data is broken down in terms of countries, states, and cities, there have been at least 273 bicycle
helmet laws enacted all over the world. Nine countries have bicycle helmet laws that apply to all ages as well as half of
Canadian provinces, some US cities, urban travel in Chile and Slovakia, and interurban travel in Israel and Spain. To date,
seventeen jurisdictions have modified their laws and only two laws have been fully repealed (Mexico City and Bosnia and
Herzegovina)" In the intervening years the Portland, Washington State, USA law has also been repealed.

        <li>The US Government: the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of DOT, has a report called 
        <a href="dotbicyclehelmetuselaws.pdf">Bicycle Helmet Use Laws: Lessons Learned from Selected Sites CD-ROM 2004</a>. It includes lessons learned
        from Austin, Texas; Jacksonville and Duval County, Florida; the State of Maryland; the State of Oregon; Port Angeles,
        Washington, and Seymour, Connecticut. It is a 219 page file in .pdf format. We include that file now on
        the CD we send with our Toolkit for Helmet Promotion Programs. Email us at the address below if you need just the CD.
        </li>
        <li>NHTSA also has an interesting page on automotive seatbelt laws, if you can find it. It shows that most states have
        minimal fines for not wearing a seatbelt. At the time of the report only 21 of them authorized a police officer to stop
        a car and ticket the driver for not wearing a belt, and some states are adding similar offenses since the #MeToo
        movement showed that they were disproportionately enforced against people of color. New Hampshire still has no seatbelt
        law for adults. The parallels with bicycle helmet laws are obvious.</li>
        <li>A <a href="briefs.htm#rodgers_state_laws">CPSC study on the effectiveness of State helmet laws</a> concludes that a
        state helmet law increases helmet use by 18.4 per cent.

        <li>The most definitive site that promoted scepticism about the use of helmets and laws to require them was that of the
        <a href="https://www.cyclehelmets.org/">Bicycle Helmet Research Foundation</a>. They find "serious flaws in the
        evidence most frequently cited in favour of helmet effectiveness. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that
        real-world data, from independent sources and based on large populations where helmet use has become common, do not
        support these claims. Most disturbing of all, there are sources of evidence to suggest that increased helmet use has
        sometimes been associated with an increase in the number or severity of head injuries to cyclists." All that is on
        their <a href="https://www.cyclehelmets.org/1004.html">Policy Statement page</a>. They have links to other like-minded
        sites. But the site now says: "Since 2020-08-29 this website is an archive, to preserve links. Not much has been added since about 2016."
