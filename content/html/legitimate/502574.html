    <i><p></i><font face="Arial">Over 30 years ago, Tobias Schneebaum wrote about his journey
    into Peru's Madre de Dios region in his cult classic <em>Keep the River on Your Right</em>
    , but now the book has an epilogue.&nbsp; A epilogue in the form of a feature length
    documentary that follows Schneebaum as he returns to to Peru and meets up with the
    remotely located Peruvians, he had lived with many years ago.&nbsp; The basic storyline is
    compelling, but Schneebaum is no ordinary traveler.&nbsp; His amazing story and details
    about the documentary can be found at <a

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><em><font size="2" face="Arial">It takes little imagination to understand
      why Roko and Adrian Belic had problems financing their film. It would focus on a type of
      music&#151;throat-singing&#151;that few had ever heard of, and be filmed in Tuva, an
      isolated region near Mongolia that wasn&#146;t even on the map. Worse still, the camera
      would follow one Paul Pena&#151;a relatively unknown blind blues singer who had taught
      himself throat-singing&#151;as he interacted with Tuvan culture. The brothers weren&#146;t
      particularly surprised that no one was interested, but neither were they dissuaded. So
      with little money and a rag-tag crew who wanted to work on the film for nothing, they
      booked a flight to Tuva.</font></em></p>

      documentary, D.A. Pennebaker&#146;s Don&#146;t Look Back follows four weeks of Bob
      Dylan&#146;s solo acoustic tour across England in 1965. Virtually absent are the standard
      documentary conventions of archival or interview footage. Nor is the film a concert
      picture, with very few live numbers captured in their entirety, and more than half of the
      film following Dylan backstage and between gigs. Instead the camera acts solely as a fly
      on the wall and for 96 minutes the viewer watches Dylan ongoing evolution as performer and
      personality. Here&#146;s hoping he&#146;s evolved since.</font></em></p>

    event for documentary filmmakers, buyers, programmers, distributors and commissioning
    editors from around the world. Last year, 1,100 industry delegates from 25 countries
    attended Hot Docs.<br>
    <br>
    This year, Hot Docs will present over 80 cutting-edge documentaries from Canada and
    abroad, and an expanded roster of professional development, networking and market events.

    documentary filmmaking; <br>
    * Cutting Truths: Convergence, Interactivity and the Future of Documentary, a one-day
    conference mounted in collaboration with the Banff New Media Institute (Banff Centre),
    exploring the impact of the &quot;digital revolution&quot; on documentary practice; <br>
    * Rendez-vous, an afternoon of one-on-one meetings between independent filmmakers and
    international documentary financiers; <br>
    * Kickstart, a half-day programme geared towards emerging documentary filmmakers. <br>
    <br>
    Regular events returning in 2001 include Filmmaker Discussions, a series of panels
    focusing on the creative aspects of documentary filmmaking; Micro-Meetings led by industry
    professionals; Master Classes with Albert Maysles and the collaborative team of D.A.
    Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus; and Hot Docs' annual Symposium, this year entitled

    with the festival, will include an on-demand videotheque and a video library of over 1,100
    documentaries. <br>
    <br>
    In 2001, Hot Docs will also mount the 2nd annual Toronto Documentary Forum (May 2-3), a
    two-day international market event during which independent documentary production teams
    pitch their projects to an international assembly of commissioning editors and other
    documentary financiers. A limited number of Observer seats are now available (see

    Amazon.com plans to announce today, July 9, that it will now add the selling of films to

    work on Amazon.com without having distribution deals with large publishers or labels.</font></p>

    category </a>to the program.&nbsp; Details are similar to the other Advantage programs, in
    that the independent video will receive the same type of display as any other video on
    Amazon.com, and the artists will receive 45% of the retail price of the video.&nbsp; The
    filmmaker is allowed to set his or her own price, and Amazon.com handles fulfillment for
    all orders and keeps filmmaker informed on sales and inventory.&nbsp; The only other
    Amazon.com related cost, is the cost of getting the videos shipped to Amazon.com.</font></p>

    <p align="left">Set to be released just as the Star Wars phenomenon reaches it height, <a
    href="http://www.trekdoc.com"><em>Trekkies</em></a> is a documentary that chronicles the
    &quot;other&quot; sci-fi fan obsession, Star Trek.&nbsp; Paramount Classics is releasing <em>Trekkies</em>
    in selected cities May 21.&nbsp; The film is produced by Paramount in association with Neo
    Art &amp; Logic Production with Roger Nygard directing.</p>
    <p align="left">Director Nygard and host Denise Crosby, who created and played the role of
    Lt. Tasha Yar on Star Trek: The Next Generation, traveled across the country documenting
    the obsessive&nbsp; and fun nature of Star Trek fans.&nbsp; Fans highlighted include
    Barbara Adams, a grand juror on the Little Rock, White Water Grand Jury, who thought
    nothing of where a Star Trek uniform to the jury proceedings.&nbsp; Another profiled fan
    legally changed his name to James T. Kirk, and yet another is considering get his ears
    physically altered to look like a Vulcan.&nbsp; These fans along with hundreds of others
    represent the subjects of <em>Trekkies</em>.</p>
    <p align="left">The films subject alone makes this a enjoyable film, but Paramount is
    getting behind the film with promotion including national television advertising, that
    includes the trailer.&nbsp; Paramount is likely getting behind the films because of it
    huge potential.&nbsp; Beyond the documentary and independent film audiences, over 100,000
    individuals have registered as official Star Trek fans.&nbsp; Other facts which Paramount
    lists in its &quot;Fun Facts&quot; section on the film's Paramount <a
    href="http://www.startrek.com/trekkies/trekkies.html">web site</a> include that, &quot;The
    average &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan spends $400 per year on &quot;Star Trek&quot;
    merchandise.&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Star Trek&quot; products have elicited over a billion
    dollars in retail sales in the last five years.&quot;.&nbsp; These numbers mean that
    Paramount thinks the film has a chance and will act accordingly.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">Gabriel C. Keorner one of the profiled fans in the film posted on the <a
    href="news://news.startrek.com/startrek.filmtrekkies">Trekkies news group</a>, that
    Paramount has released 320 prints of <em>Trekkies</em> nationwide for the May 21 weekend.
    We have posted a <a href="trekkies.htm">list</a> of theaters were the film will playing
    this weekend.&nbsp; This number of prints being released for a documentary in the first
    week is very rare.&nbsp; Hopefully this support for the films will allow it to be shown on
    screens across the country, during the traditionally competitive summer film market.

    <p align="left">This past year has witnessed the released of several films that deal in
    some way with the Holocaust.&nbsp; Whether it be the comedic drama Life is Beautiful or
    the Oscar winning documentary The Last Days, films are increasingly more willing to deal
    with the issues of the Holocaust, and with a increased level of frankness.&nbsp; However,
    long before any of these movies had ever even been conceived, and just at the end of World
    War II as the allies began to liberate the concentration camps, the United States and
    British governments conceived of a plan to film the conditions of the camps and the
    results of the Nazi's actions.</p>
    <p align="left">This effort resulted in the filming of six reels and the contribution of
    Alfred Hitchcock in editing the film, but bureaucratic fights and changing priorities left
    this film without release until 40 years later.&nbsp; In 1985, Frontline, attempting to
    remain true to the filmmaker's vision of the film, recorded the written narration that
    accompanied the film and showed it to a nationwide audience.</p>
    <p align="left">This week Frontline is showing this one hour film again; it should not be
    missed, as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/talk.html">viewers

    &quot;The colorful, neon like murals seen here (far removed from the ugly gang territory
    markings) are, rather the brash Picasso's of&nbsp; hip-hop culture.&quot;<br>
    Booklist Review<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The minority Artists are so well represented and come across with such integrity,
    intelligence, cultural and artistic knowledge .&nbsp; This will do a great deal to help
    dispel the usually wrong impression that Graffiti Artists are anti-intellectual and
    unaware of anything other that their own wish to express themselves.&quot;<br>

    &quot;The work shown here in this video is very impressive, even more so when you consider
    that the primary tool here is a can of spray paint.&quot;<br>
    Video Librarian Review<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The strength of your videotape is that you focus on the commentary of the
    Artists...to understand their thinking and what motivates them is really important to an
    appreciation of this art form.&quot;<br>

    &quot;Intelligent and in-depth, it's 45 minutes of art, from Gallery Shows to the stuff on

    Page</em></strong></big></big></p>
    <p align="left">This year 18 dramatic films will be presented at Sundance, but more
    importantly 18 documentaries will be presented.&nbsp; Here at Documentary Films .Net we
    have our prediction for the doc that will be the most talked about this year.&nbsp; It is<a
    href="http://www.d-word.com/homepage/index.html"> <em>Home Page</em></a>, from <a
    href="http://www.d-word.com/bio.html">Doug Block</a> a Sundance veteran, who has produced
    such films as <a href="http://el.net/jupiters-wife/wife.html">Jupiter's Wife</a> and <em>Silverlake
    Life: The View From Here</em>. Both of these films where prize winners at Sundance, but
    this time his film is somewhat different.</p>
    <p align="left">Block began to travel the country in a effort to understand the Internet
    phenomenon that was becoming the focus of America's youth.&nbsp; He travels and meets
    various Internet fixtures such as Justin Hall of <a href="http://www.links.net">www.links.net</a>,
    &nbsp;and Block chronicles all of his travels on film.&nbsp; In the process he becomes
    what he studies: a Internet junkie.&nbsp; This new understanding starts in his
    establishing of a web site <a href="http://www.d-word.com">D-Word</a> devoted to what he
    loves: documentaries. &nbsp; As Block begins to turn his focus inward, he deals with his
    relation with the Internet and how it enhances his ability to communicate with others.</p>
    <p align="left">Block used part of his <a href="http://www.d-word.com">D-Word</a> site to
    keep the Internet community abreast on the status of the film.&nbsp; He even posted when
    he got the <a href="http://www.radzone.org/d-word/journal/11-25-98.html">call</a> from
    Sundance.&nbsp; This film is truly a film of the Internet.</p>
    <p align="left">Undoubtedly, as the population as a whole becomes more interested in the
    Internet, <em>Home Page</em> will receive a&nbsp;considerable amount of public
    exposure.&nbsp; A Sundance victory will be one of the steps towards this exposure.</p>

    <p align="left"><big><big><strong><a name="Frontline 1999">Frontline 1999</a>: The Triumph
    of Evil -- Genocide in Rwanda</strong></big></big></p>
    <p align="left"><em>Frontline</em>'s<strong> </strong>season is well underway, and several
    great documentaries have aired including the season opener <em>A Farmer's Wife</em>, <em>Ambush
    at Mogadishu</em> as well as the somewhat disappointing <em>Jesus to Christ</em>, among
    others.&nbsp; However, some of the best of the season should be coming in 1999.</p>
    <p align="left">The January 12 <em>Frontline</em>, <em>Snitch</em>, will highlight, how
    the mandatory minimum laws are forcing all those that are accused of a drug related crime
    to turn state evidence, whether they have legitimate information or not to avoid a
    life-time in jail.&nbsp; The result of this system is that more and more lower-level
    dealer are landing jail sentences that surpass murders and rapists. &nbsp; This
    documentary will be highlighting the depth (90 minutes) that <em>Frontline</em> continues
    to put into its analysis of the drug war and its consequences.</p>
    <p align="left">On January 29, <em>Frontline</em> in <em>The Triumph of Evil</em> examines
    the genocide that Western governments promised would not happen again after the Holocaust:
    the 1994 <strong>Genocide in Rwanda.</strong>&nbsp; <em>Frontline</em> is finally doing
    what few other U.S. journalist would do, address the genocide that the world let happen.
    &nbsp; Following two UN detectives, <em>Frontline</em> exposes the continuing dismissal
    conditions in the country and the cover-up of genocide. This documentary should not be
    missed. </td>
