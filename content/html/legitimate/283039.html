<blockquote>
The <b>subject</b> of the game, which is part of the company's
American Adventure series, is a 1903 Packard trip from San Francisco
to New York completed in sixty-one days.
It was not the first, but the third such journey
completed, nor was it the fastest motor vehicle to have so done, it having
been done previously in fifty days by motorcycle.
But in the superhighway/jumbo jet era, it is almost
impossible for us to imagine what was required to drive unreliable
cars over such a distance, especially in the west where  roads and communication
facilities were so few and far between.  The game's two-page
historical article, apparently prepared
by personnel at the Henry Ford Museum, does a good job of detailing the
historical background.
<p>
Also with this <b>game</b> for 1-4 players comes a non-resealable plastic bag
with a map, four cut-out car pieces (in two varieties),
sixty-three points pieces and a spinner.  All of the above
material comes on heavy paper.  Also included are plastic
parts for a spinner and two pages of instructions.
<p>
The <b>map</b> is an old-style representation of the United States
in two broad swaths, the top from San Francisco to Kansas and the bottom
from Kansas to New York.  The instructions mention that the board is designed
to be cut lengthwise and joined  together at the ends to show the
proper geography, but that this is not strictly necessary.  Indeed,
to do so would be to cut in half the article which is printed on the
back of the game map.  Superimposed on the map are sixty spaces in
which the paper cars may move from coast to coast.  Each space is rated
for terrain conditions, e.g. "Good Road", "Desert and Sand", or 
"Mountain Roads and Trails."
<p>
Players all begin on the Start space with five points
and <b>move</b> one space forward each turn.  A space may have a number in it &ndash;
upon arriving there, a player receives this number in points.
The more difficult the terrain in a space, the higher the number &ndash; they
range from zero to three. After landing in the space, the player spins
the spinner and consults one of six tables that make up what is called
"Mr. Tom Fetch's Complete Guide to The Great Transcontinental Automobile Trip."
This table will have some effect on the player's fortunes, ranging anywhere
from "lose a turn" or "go back 1" to "advance 3" (on good roads).
<p>
The <b>instructions</b> are clear and leave no doubts about the correct way to play.
Two ways of playing are offered.  One version gives victory to the
car which acquires the most points, with finishing first contributing to
that while the second version is purely interested in minimizing the number of
turns.
<p>
In terms of <b>strategy,</b> there is not much here of interest.  There are three
decisions to be made along the route depending on which route the player
wishes to take, but they seem to not make much difference.  Or, if one route
can be proven to be better than others, there is no reason to prohibit 
everyone from using it.  If cars could interact with one another in some
way, or if special conditions of some cars gave them certain proclivities
toward one fork or the other, those could contribute toward the route choice,
but such things do not exist here.  Players must always resolutely move
forward at a speed of one.  If instead they were allowed to vary their pace,
they might have had an interesting tradeoff to make between points and
speed in the points version of the game.  But the rules state that
each space entered provides points, regardless of whether or not the car stopped
in that space or merely passed through it via table.  The table events do not
permit any player choices either.
<p>
The game states that it is designed for ages 8 to adult which is somewhat at
variance with the website which states 10 to adult.  Regardless of the lower
age bound, without any apparent strategy considerations in the game, the upper
bound is questionable to me.  It appears that game should be mainly of interest
to players who have recently reached a decent reading age and at most, a couple
years beyond.  Perhaps in that audience, this racing game may awaken some interest
in a little-known segment of American history and encourage them to read more.
Beyond this <b>educational</b> use, there isn't much mature game value.
