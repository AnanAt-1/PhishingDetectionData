useful  auxiliary  to  all  departments  of  business,  and  all  classes  of 
the  community,  over  the  United  States. 


A  BRIEF 
HISTORY  OF  PITTSBURGH. 

In  Writing  a  history  of  the  prosperous  City  which  now  stands 
at  the  head  of  the  Ohio,  we  will  be  brief  and  concise. 

The  Governor  of  Canada,  with  that  enterprising  ambition  so 
characteristic  of  Frenchmen,  had  formed  a  vast  scheme  for  the 
connection  of  Canada  with  Louisiana,  by  a  line  of  well  selected 
posts,  to  be  extended  from  .the  Lakes  to  the  Mississippi.  It 
was  hoped  that  this  scheme,  if  successfiil»  would  not  only  con- 
tribute to  the  mutual  advantage  of  those  distant  Provinces,  but 
would  also  circumscribe  the  bounds  of  the  English  Colonies,

and  effectually  destroy  their  trade  and  influence  with  the  In- 
dians. A  post  had  already  heen  established  at  the  mouth  of 
French  creek,  where  the  village  of  Franklin  now  stands,  and 
preparations  were  making  to  take  possession  of  "  the  Forks," 
at  the  junction  of  the  Monongahela  and  Allegheny  rivers.  The 
Governor  of  Virginia,  becoming  alarmed  by  the  intelligence  he 
had  received  of  the  progress  of  the  French,  despatched  GEO. 
WASHINGTON  from  that  state  with  instructions  to  proceed 
to  Fort  Venango,  (the  name  of  the  Fort  at«French  creek)  to  de- 
mand an  explanation  of  their  designs  from  the  French  comman- 
dant. On  his  way  to  Fort  Venango,  on  the  23d  of  November, 
1753,  he  arrived  at  the  spot  where  Pittsburgh  now  covers. 
While  here  he  carefully  examined  the  ground,  and  thought  it  a 
very  suitable  position  for  the  erection  of  a  military  post.  From 
a  careful  perusal  of  his  journal,  it  seems  manifest,  that  there 
w- as  not  at  that  time,  a  single  white  resident  within  the  limits 
of  our  present  City. 

In  the  ensuing  spring,  the  Virginia  Ohio  Conipany,  made  ar- 
rangements to  take  permanent  possession  of  the  country  near 
the  junction  of  liie  Allegheny  and  .Monongahela  rivers,  and  had 
commenced  the  erection  of  a  redoubt,  to  secure  their  possession. 
On  the  17th  April,  1754,  before  this  redoubt  was  completed, 
Monsieur  de  Contrecceur,  a  French  officer,  with  three  hundred 
canoes,  containing  one  thousand  French  and  Indians,  and  eigh- 
teen pieces  of  cannon,  arrived  here  from  Fort  Venango  and  com- 
pelled Ensign  Ward,  who  commanded  the  party  engaged  in 
erecting  the  redoubt,  to  surrender.  The  capture  of  this  small 
detachment  of  troops  w^as  the  first  open  act  of  hostility  commit- 
ed  by  the  French^  and  may  be  considered  as  the  commencement 
of  a  war  which  continued  for  nine  years,  and  which  agitated 
the  two  continents,  from  the  banks  of  the  Ganges  to  the  head 
of  the  Ohio.  From  the  17th  April,  1754,  to  the  24th  Novem- 
ber, 1758,  the  French  retained  possession  of  this  place;  and 
this  position  gave  them  an  influence  over  the  neighboring  tribes 
of  Indians,  which  was  so  used  as  to  inflict  upon  the  frontier 
settlers  much  distress  and  bloodshed.  The  importance  of  this 
position  in  a  military  point  of  view,  was  duly  appreciated,  and 
early  and  energetic  measures  were  adopted  to  expel  the  French. 
The  expedition  and  defeat  of  General  Braddock,  on  the  9th 
,Tuly,  1755,  are  notorious  events,  the  account  of  which  is  not 
necessary  to  repeat  in  this  sketch.  In  1758,  a  formidable  army 
was  assembled  at  Carlisle,  under  the  command  of  Gen.  Forbes. 
On  the  14th  September,  1758,  Major  Grant  who  had  been  de- 
tached in  advance  from  Loyalhanna,  with  eight  hundred  men, 
was  surrounded  by  the  enemy,  on  the  hill  which  has  sineo 
borne  his  name,  and  lost  above  three  hundred  men  killed  or 
taken  prisoners,  and  himself  shared  the  latter  fate.  General 
Forbes,  however,  undismayed  by  this  disaster,  pressed  forward, 
and  having  on  the  24th  November,  1758,  arrived  within  cme

day's  march  of  Fort  du  Quesne,  the  French  having  set  fire  to  the 
Fort,  abandoned  it,  and  descended  by  the  Ohio  to  their  posts 
on  the  Mississippi.  On  the  next  day  General  Forbes  took 
possession  of  the  abandoned  post,  having  hastily  repaired  the 
fortifications,  and  garrisoned  them  with  four  hundred  and  fifty 
men,  principally  Provincials,  from  Pennsylvania,  Maryland, 
and  Virginia,  under  Colonel  Mercer-— the  General  marched  the 
rest  of  the  troops  to  Lancaster,  Reading,  and  Philadelphia* 

In  1763  an  arrangement  w^as  made  between  the  Shawanese, 
and  other  tribes  of  Indians,  along  the  Lakes,  and  on  the  Ohio, 
and  its  tributary  streams,  to  attack,  simultaneously,  all  the 
English  posts  and  frontier  settlements.  Li  the  execution  of  this 
plan,  they  captured  Le  Boeuf,  Venango,  Presquile,  Michilimac- 
kinac,  and  various  other  posts,  which  were  feebly  garrisoned, 
and  murdered  all  the  prisoners.  As  a  part  of  this  great  scheme 
of  operations.  Fort  Pitt  was  completely  surrounded  by  the  Indi- 
ans, who  cut  off  all  communication  with  the  interior  of  the 
country,  and  greatly  annoyed  the  garrison  by  an  incessant  dis- 
charge of  musketry  and  arrows.  The  commanding  officer. 
Captain  Ewyer,  and  the  garrison,  (which  was  increased  by  the 
Indian  traders,  who  had  escaped  massacre  and  taken  refuge  in 
tlie  fort)  made  a  gallant  defence. 

Colonel  Bouquet  was  detached  from  Carlisle,  to  relieve  the 
beleaguered  posts,  and  after  a  severe  conflict  with  the  Indians, 
at  Bushy  Run,  he  arrived  at  Fort  Pitt  on  the  9th  of  August, 
1763.  In  the  action  of  the  5th  August,  1763,  the  Indians  were 
severely  handled,  several  of  their  principal  Chiefs  were  killed, 
and  they  were  so  much  dispirited  that  they  immediately  aban- 
doned their  operations  against  Fort  Pitt,  and  retired  to  their 
Towns  on  the  Muskingum  and  farther  west.  In  October,  1764, 
Colonel  Bouquet  marched  on  an  expedition  against  the  Indian 
towns  on  the  Muskingum.  He  reached  the  Indian  towns  near 
the  forks  of  that  river,  without  opposition,  and  there  dictated 
tenns  of  peace  to  them. 

It  was  during  this  year,  1764,  probably  after  the  treaty  had 
removed  all  fear  of  the  Indians,  that  the  old  military  plan,  being 
that  portion  of  the  city  lying  between  Water  street  and  Second 
street,  and  between  Market  and  Ferry  streets,  was  laid  out. 
During  this  year  also,  was  erected  the  brick  redoubt  still  stand- 
ing, a  little  west  of  Stanwix  street,  and  north  of  Penn  street, 
being  the  only  remaining  monument  of  British  industry  within 
our  city  limits.  In  a  stone  block,  in  the  south  face  of  this  re- 
doubt, is  still  to  be  seen  this  inscription,  "  CoL  Bouquet,  A.  D., 
1764.* 


*  In  our  early  day,  the  ditch  that  ran  from  the  Allegheny  river 
through  Marbury,  down  Liberty  and  Short  street  to  the  Monon- 
gahela,  and  the  Mound,  and  several  old  brick  and  log  houses, 
■that  composed  apart  of  old  '•'FortFUU^'  were  standing  conspic- 


0  HISTORV    OF    PITTSBURGH. 

From  tl.is  time  mitil  the  close  of  the  Revolutionary  war,  but 
little  imp'oi^ement  was  made  at  Pittsburgh.  The  fear  of  Indian 
hostilities,  or  the  actual  existence  of  Indian  warfare  prevented 
emigration.  In  1775,  the  number  of  dwelling  houses  within 
the  limits  of  our  present  City,  did  not,  according  to  the  most  au- 
thentic accounts,  exceed  twenty-five  or  thirty. 

During  the  Revolution,  the  Penn  family  were  adherents  of 
the  British  Government,  and  in  1779,  the  Legislature  of  this 
State  confiscated  all  their  property,  except  certain  manors,  &amp;c. 
of  which  surveys  had  been  actually  made  and  returned  into  the. 
land  office,  prior  to  the  4th  of  July,  1776,  and  also,  except  any 
estates  which  the  said  Penns  held  in  their  private  capacities,  by 
devise,  purchase  or  descent.  Pittsburgh  and  the  country  east- 
ward of  it  and  south  of  the  Monongahela,  containing  about  5800 
acres,  com'posed  one  of  these  manors,  and  of  course  remained  as 
the  property  of  the  Penns. 

In  the  spring  of  1784,  arrangements  were  made  bj?"  Mr.  Tench 
Francis,  the  agent  of  the  Penns,  to  lay  out  the  manor  of  Pitts- 
burgh, in  town  lots  and  out  lots,  and  to^sell  them  without  dela3^ 
For  this  purpose  he  engaged  Mr.  Geo.  Woods,  of  Bedford,  an 
experienced  surveyor,  to  execute  this  work.  In  May,  1784,  Mr. 
Woods  arrived  here,  bringing  with  him  as  an  operative  survey- 
or, Mr.  Thomas  Vickroy,  of  Bedford  county,  who  was  then  a 
very  young  man,  and  who  still  survives  and  enjoj^s  vigorous 
health,  at  a  good  old  age.  Thro'  theiaactivity  and  industry,  the 
work  was  soon  completed,  and  the  lots  and  out  lots  being  pla- 
ced in  market,  seem  to  have  been  very  rapidly  purchased.  From 
this  time  improvement  seems  to  have  commenced  here — Me- 
chanics and  traders  composed  a  greater  proportion  of  the  popu- 
lation. In  1784,  Arthur  Lee,  a  conspicuous  diplomatist  during 
our  Revolution,  was  appointed  a  commissioner  to  treat  with  the 
Indians,  and  on  his  w^ay  passed  through  Pittsburgh.  In  his 
journal  we  find  the  following  notice  of  this  place:  "  Pittsburgh 
is  inhabited  almost  entirely  hj  Scots  and  Irish,  who  live  in  pal- 
try log  houses,  and  are  as  dirty  as  in  the  north  of  Ireland,  or 
even  Scotland.  There  is  a  great  deal  of  small  trade  carried  on; 
the  goods  being  brought  at  the  vast  expense  of  forty-five^  shil- 
ings  per  cwt.,  from  Philadelphia  and  Baltimore.  They  'take, 
in  the  shops,  money,  wheat,  flour,  and  skins.  There  are  in  the 
town  four  attorneys,  two  doctors,  and  not  a  priest  of  any  per- 
suasion, nor  church,  nor  chapel.  The  rivers  encroach  fast  on 
the  town;  and  to  guch  a  degree,  that,  as  a  gentleman  told  me, 
the  Allegheny  had  within  thirty  years  of  his  memory,  carried 
away  one  hundred  yards.     The  place,  I  believe,  will  never  be 

uos.  Several'  of  our  first  houses  were  built  of  old  brick,  es- 
pecially, the  large  three  story  brick  house  at  the  cornc-'r  of  the

very  considerable."  If  Mr.  Lee  could  now  visit  tlie  valley  of 
the  head  of  the  Ohio,  he  would  find  here,  a  free  white  popiila- 
^  tion  exceeding  that  of  the  six  largest  cities  and  towns  in  the 
Old  Dominion.  The  appearance  of  Pittsburgh  at  that  time, 
was  not  such  as  would  excite  extravagant  expectations.  A 
small  town,  composed  of  two  or  three  brick  redoubts,  converted 
into  dwelling-houses,  and  some  forty  or  fifty  round  or  hewn  log 
buildings,  inhabited  principally  by  poor  mechanics  and  laborers, 
would  have  a  very  discouraging  aspect  to  the  eye  of  a  Virgi- 
nia gentleman,  who  had  visited  London,  Paris,  aiwl  Madrid. 
But  these  mechanics  and  laborers  were  free,  had  the  directions 
of  their  own  exertions,  were  industrious,  were  striving  for  the 
advantages  of  themselves  and  their  offspring,  and  the  possession 
and  enjoyment  of  the  produce  of  their  own  labor  were  secured 
to  them  by  equal  laws.  These  circumstances,  aided  by  the 
natural  advantages  of  this  situation,  in  less  than  fifty  years, 
converted  a  village  of  a  few  petty  log  houses,  into  a  large, 
"healthy,  and  rapidly  increasing  city. 

Discouraging  as  were  the  appearances  of  things  in  1784,  yet 
in  1786,  John  vScull  and  Joseph  Hall  two  poor  but  enterprising 
young  men,  boldly  determined  to  r-isk  their  little  all  in  a  print- 
ing establishment  here,  and  on  the  SQth  of  July,  of  that  year, 
issued  the  first  number  of  the  Pittsburgh  (razette.  The  publi- 
cation of  a  paper,  by  disseminating  information,  and  attracting 
attention  to  the  place,  no  doubt  contributed  to  the  growth  of  the 
town;  it  therefore  deserves  to  be  mentioned  as  one  of  the  causes 
of  the  rise  of  a  frontier  village  to  a  great  city. 

About  this  time  the  tide  of  emigration  from  Pennsylvania  and 
Virginia  to  Kentucky  commenced,  and  in  its  progress  it  contri- 
buted to  the  advancement  of  the  place,  not  only  by  leaving  por- 
tions of  the  funds  of  the  emigrants,  in  exchange  for  the  means 
•  of  transportation  and  supplies,  but  occasionally  leaving  here 
some  of  the  emigrants  themselves. 

The  Indian  wars,  too,  which  raged  on  our  Northern  and 
Western  frontier,  until.  Wayne's  treaty,  in  1795,  by  collecting 
here  large  bodies  of  troops,  thus  creating  a  demand  for  the  pro- 
duce of  farms  and  shops,  contributed  greatly  to  the  prosperity 
and  growth  of  our  town.  On  the  24th  September,  1788,  an  act 
passed  creating  the  county  of  Allegheny,  out  of  parts  of  Wash- 
ington and  Westmoreland  counties.  By  this  act  the  Courts 
were  appointed  to  be  held  at  Pittsburgh,  until  certain  trustees 
named  in  the  act,  should  erect  suitable  buildings  on  the  reserv- 
ed tract  opposite  Pittsburgh.  By  the  act  of  the  13tb  April, 
1891,  this  provision  of  the  act  of  1788  was  repealed,  and  thf 
trustees  were  authorized  and  required  to  purchase  lost  in  Pitts- 
burgh for  a  Court  House  and  Jail. 

The  creation  of  a  separate  county,  and  the  consequent  estab- 
lishment of  county  offices,  and  the  frequent  assemblage  here  ot 
jtirors,  suitorf*  ^.-nd  witnesses,  operated  to  the  advantage  and  im-

provement  of  the  place.  The  most  important  event,  however, 
in  the  early  history  of  our  town,  was  the  Western  insurrection, 
in  179 1.  This  disturbance  compelled  the  Government  to  send 
a  large  number  of  troops  to  this  neighborhood.  These  troops 
were  principally  volunteers;  active  enterprising  young  men, 
many  of  whoni  were  so  pleased  with  Pittsburgh  and  the  sur- 
rounding country,  that  after  performing  their  tour  of  duty,  they 
returned  home  merely  to  make  the  necessary  arrangements  for 
a  permanent  settlement  here.  From  that  time  the  progress  of 
this  city  has  been  regular,  and  scarcely  interrupted,  except  by 
the  reaction  which  took  place  after  the  late  war. 
'  In  addition  to  the  foregoing  "  Brief  Sketch,"  a  few  statistical 
and  appropriate  facts  relative  to  the  progress  of  our  town,  at  an 
early  peried,  will  here  be  added. 

In  an  article  written  by  the  late  Judge  Brackenridge,  then  a 
young  attorney,  and  published  in  the  first  number  of  the  Pitts- 
burgh Gazette,  the  number  of  houses  in  the  town  of  Pittsburgh, 
was  stated  to  be  about  one  hundred.  Allowing  to  each  house 
five  inhabitants,  which  is  probably  quite  enough,  the  population 
w^ould  be  about  five  hundred. 

In  the  Pittsburgh  Gazette  of  the  9th  of  January,  1796,  we 
find  the  following  paragraph: 

"  The  number  of  inhabitants  in  the  borough  of  Pittsburgh,  as 
taken  by  the  assessors,  during  the  last  week,  amounts  to  one 
thousand  three  hundred  and  ninety-jive.''''  This  is  the  earliest  au- 
thentic account  of  the  population  of  this  place. 

In  a  description  of  the  country  at  the  head  of  the  Ohio,  pub- 
lislied  in  the  4th  and  5th  numbers  of  the  Pittsburgh  Gazette,  on 
the  19th  and  26th  of  August,  1789,  we  find  some  statements 
which  may  be  interesting. 

1.  It  appears  that  there  was  then  settled  in  the  town,  one 
clergyman  of  the  Calvinistic  church,  Samuel  Barr,  and  one  of 
the  German  Calvinistic  church,  occasionally  preached  here. 

2.  It  is  stated  also,  that  "  a  church  of  squared  timber  and 
moderate  dimensions  is  on  the  way  to  be  built."  This  church 
stood  Avithin  the  ground  now  covered  by  the  First  Presbyterian 
church. 

3.  There  were  two  gentlemen  of  the  medical  family  then 
here.     One  we  know,  was  Dr.  Bedford. 

4.  There  were  also  two  lawyers  here.  These,  we  presume, 
were  the  late  Judge  Brackenridge  and  John  Woods. 

5.  Carriages  from  Philadelphia  were  then  six  pence  for  each 
pound  weight.  The  writer  makes  the  following  prediction. 
'•'  However  improved  the  conveyance  may  be,  and  by  whatever 
channel,  the  importation  of  heavy  articles  will  still  be  expen- 
sive. The  manufacturing  them,  therefore,  will  become  more  an 
ebject  here  than  elsewhere.'''* 

Pittsburgh  was  then  (1786)  in  Westmoreland  county,  and 
the  inhabitants  had  to  travel  to  Hannah's  town,  about,  thirty 
miles  to  attend  court. 


HISTORY    OF    PITTSBURGH.  9 

In  the  Pittsburgh  Gazette  of  September  30, 1786,  there  is  the 
following  extract  of  a  letter,  dated 

Philadelphia,  Sept.  U,  1786. 

"  Mr.  Brison  has  just  returned  from  New-  Yorlt,  with  orders 
to  establish  a  post  from  this  place  to  Pittsburgh,  and  one  from 
Virginia  to  Bedford.     The  two  to  meet  at  Bedford." 

Prior  to  that  time  there  was  no  regular  mail  to  this  place, 
and  the  then  printers  of  the  Gazette  and  other  inhabitants  had 
to  depend  upon  casual  travellers. 

In  the  Gazette  of  March  10,  1787,  it  is  mentioned  that  "^a 
meeting  of  the  inhabitants  of  Pittsburgh,  had  been  held  on  the 
Istinst.  and  that  Messrs.  Hugh  Ross,  Stephen  Bayard,  and  the 
Rev.  Samuel!  Barr,  had  been  appointed  a  committee  to  report  a 
plan  for  building  a  Market  House  and  establishing  market  days." 
The  citizens  were  also  invited  to  meet  the  committee  in  the 
public  square  on  Monday  the  IStliw  inst.,  to  hear  their  report. 
Soon  afterward  the  first  Market  House  was  erected  near  the 
corner  of  Second  and  Market  streets,  where  Beale's  tavern  now' 
stands. 

During  the  session  of  the  Legislature  of  1786-7  an  act  v/as 
passed  "  for  the  establishment  of  an  Academy  or  Public  School 
at  Pittsburgh,  and-  another  for  the  incorporation  of  the  Church 
of  Pittsburgh,"  being  in  fact  the  first  Presbyterian  Church. 

The  first  act  for  the  incorporation  of  the  Borough  of  Pitts- 
burgh, was  passed  on  the  22d  of  April,  1794.  The  act  to  incor- 
porate the  City  of  Pittsburgh,  was  passed  on  the  18th  of  March, 
1816. 


PREFACE  TO  THE  WORK. 

HISTORICAL  CONTRAST. 

We  have  again,  for  a  third  time,  responded  to  the  calls  and 
wants  of  our  business  community,  by  preparing  a  brief  view  of 
the  trade,  commerce,  manufactures,  and  business,  of  Pittsburgh 
and  many  flourishing  cities  and  towns  in  the  West,  and  interior 
of  our  country.  In  1837,  we  performed  a  similar  service,  and 
presented  a  very  general  detail  of  the  business  of  Pittsburgh,  in 
all  its  various  departments,  and  of  about  100  towns  and  cities, 
also.  In  1839,  we  furnished  a  Director)^  of  Pittsburgh,  Alle- 
gheny, and  the  immediate  environs.  We  have  been  encouraged 
to  extend  our  views,  and  enlarge  our  work,  to  meet  the  wide 
spread  progress  of  our  rapidly  growing  trade,  commerce,  ma- 
nufactures, agricultural  interests,  and  mechanical  arts, — and  a 
brief  history  of  our  business,  rivers,  lakes,  canals,  rail  roadS; 
and  turnpikes,  besides  a  considerable  amount  of  very  valuable 
statistical  information,  with  a  notice  of  each  town  and  city  unci  ei

its  proper  head, — all  which  we  have  collected  with  care;  and 
we  strove  to  present,  not  a  Pittsburgh,  but  an  impartial  General 
Business  Directory. 

From  1790  to  1800,  the  business  of  Pittsburgh  and  the  West 
was  small,  but  gradually  improving,  the  fur  trade  of  the  West 
was  very  important,  and  Messrs.  Peter  Maynard  and  William 
;^  Morrison  were  engaged  largely  in  it,  and  from  1790  to  1796  re- 
ceived considerable  supplies  of  goods,  through  Mr.  Gay  Bryan, 
a  wealthy  merchant  in  Philadelphia,  and  the  goods  were  taken 
to  Kaskaskia  in  a  barge,  which  annually  returned  to  Pittsburgh, 
laden  with  bear,  buffaloe,  and  deer  skins,  and  furs  and  peltries 
of  all  kinds,  which  were  sent  to  Mr.  Bryan,  and  the  barge  re- 
turned, laden  with  goods;  at  that  period  there  was  no  regular 
drayman  in  Pittsburgh,  and  the  goods  were  generally  hauled 
from  the  boats  with  a  three  horse  wagon,  until  (in  1797)  a  Mr. 
James  Rattle,  an  Englishman,  settled  in  this  city,  and  was  en- 
couraged to  take  up  the  business,  and  drayed  and  stored  goods, 
until  a  box  of  dry  goods  was  stolen  from  his  yard,  and  shed, 
(for  then  we  had  no  warehouse,  nor  regular  commission  mer- 
chant, in  Pittsburgh,)  and  this  broke  the  poor  man  up,  and  he 
died  broken-hearted  and  unhappy. 

A  French  gentleman,  Louis  AnastasiusTaras(jon,*  emigrated 
in  1794,  from  France,  and  established  himself  in  Philadelphia, 
as  a  merchant;  he  was  a  large  importer  of  silks,  and  all  kinds  of 
French  and  German  goods;  being  very  wealthy  and  enterpris- 
ing, in  1799  he  sent  two  of  his  clerks,  Charles  Brugiere  and 
JamesBerthoud,  to  examine  the  course  of  the  Ohio  and  Mis- 
sissippi Rivers,  from  Pittsburgh  to  New  Orleans,  and  ascertain 
the  practicability  of  sending  ships  and  clearing  them  from  this 
port,  ready  rigged,?to  the  West  Indies  and  Europe.  Those  two 
gentlemen  returned  to  Philadelphia,  reported  favorably,  and  Mr. 
TarasQon  associated  them  and  his  brother,  John  Anthony,  with 
himself,  under  the  firm  of  "John  A.  TarasQon,  brothers,  James 
Berthoud,  &amp;  Co.,"  and  immediately  established,  in  Pittsburgh, 
a  large  wholesale  and  retail  store  and  warehouse,  a  ship  yard,  a 
rigging  and  sail  loft,  an  anchor  smith  shop,  a  block  manufacto- 
ry, and  in  short  every  thing  necessary  to  complete  vessels  for 
sea.  The  first  year,  1801,  they  built  the  Schooner  Amity,  of 
120  tons,  and  the  Ship  Pittsburgh,  of  250  tons;  and  sent  the  for- 
mer, loaded  with  flour,  to  St.  Thomas,  and  the  other,  also  with 
flour,  to  Philadelphia,  from  whence  they  sent  them  to  Bordeaux, 
and  brought  back  a  cargo  of  wine,  brandy,  and  other  French 
goods,  part  of  which  they  sent  here  in  wagons  at  a  carriage  of 
from  six  to  eight  cents  per  pound.  In  1802,  they  built  the  brig 
Nanino,  of  250  tons, — in  1803,  the  ship  Louisiana,  of  300  tons, 
— and  in  1804,  the  Ship  Western  Trader,  of  400  tons. 

*  These  facts  have  been  furnished  by  Anthony  Beelen,  Esq., 
an  early  merchant. 


HISTORICAL  CONTRAST.  11 

In  or  about  the  year  1796,  three  of  the  Royal  Princes  of  Or- 
leans came  to  Pittsburg-h,  and  stopped  at  a  hotel,  situated  on  the 
bank  of  the  Monongahela,  where  Jno.  D.  Davis'  warehouse  now 
stands;  they  were  very  affable  and  conversant,  and  remained  for 
some  time  in  the  city;  at  length  they  procured  a  large  skiff,  part 
of  which  was  covered  with  tow  linen,  laid  in  a  supjily  of  provi- 
sions, and  (having-  procured  two  men  to  row  the  skiff,)  proceed- 
ed on  to  New  Orleans.  One  of  these  Princes  was  Louis  Phil- 
lippe,  the  present  King  of  France;  who,  in  his  exile,  visited  our 
city,  and  spent  his  time  very  agreeably  with  General  Neville, 
General  James  O'Hara,  and  several  other  repectable  families, 
who  then  lived  on  the  bank  of  the  Monongahela  River. 

Having'  lived  in  Pittsburgh  forty  years,  the  most  of  which 
time  we  have  been  actively  engaged  in  business,  in  the  busy 
throng  of  trade,  and  having  in  early  times  travelled  a  good  deal, 
we  present  a  variety  of  facts  and  statistics,  in  the  course  of  our 
work,  to  shew  by  way  of  contrast,  not  only  what  Pittsburgh — 
but  Wheeling,  Erie,  Cleaveland,  Chambersburgh,  and  a  number 
of  flourishing  towns  and  cities,  were  in  our  early  days,  and 
what,  by  their  real  business,  they  are  now.  Facts  that  will 
shew,  that  in  about  forty  years,  our  own  time,  these  United 
States,  and  especially  our  range  and  portion  of  it,  have  exceeded 
in  growth,  population,  improvement,  and  wealth,  any  nation  on 
the  face  of  the  earth;  for  we  remember  well  during  the  Embargo 
times  and  last  war,  when  the  internal  trade  and  commerce  of 
Pittsburgh,  by  the  Ohio,  Western,  and  Southern  Rivers,  brought 
us  comparatively  nigh  to  Wheeling,  Cincinnati,  Louisville, 
Nashville,  St.  Louis,  Natchez,  and  New  Orleans — but  the  slow 
process  of  keel  boats  and  barges  was  such,  that  it  consumed 
almosFa  whole  summer  for  a  trip  down  and  up, — when  all  was 
done  by  the  hardy  boatman,  with  the  pole  or  by  warping, — 
and  when  a  barge  arrived,  with  furs  from  St.  Louis,  cotton 
frcm  Natchez,  hemp,  tobacco,  and  saltpetre  from  Maysville,  or 
sugar  and  cotton  from  New  Orleans  and  Natchez,  it  was  a  won- 
der to  the  many,  and  drew  vast  crowds  to  see  and  rejoice  over 
it;  and  the  internal  commerce  during  the  war,  allied  us  closely 
with  Richmond,  Baltimore,  Philadelphia  and  New  York,  these 
cities  getting  much  of  their  sugar,  saltpetre,  &amp;c.,  by  boats  and 
wagons,  through  Pittsburgh,  which  then  did  an  immense  carry- 
ing trade  for  the  United  States. 

Since  the  Steam  Boats,  Canals,  Turnpikes,  Rail  Roads,  and 
other  public  improvements  have  afforded  vast  additional  facili- 
ties for  supplying  the  great,  wide-spread,  and  wonderful  West 
with  goods  and  manufactures  of  all  kinds,  and  transporting  her 
rich  and  inexhaustless  supplies  of  tobacco,  lead,  iron,  cotton,  su- 
gar, molasses,  flour,  furs,  peltries,  &amp;c.  &amp;c.  to  the  eastern  cities, 
who,  we  ask,  can  measure,  count,  or  estimate  the  immense 
magnitude  of  this  trade  in  future  ;^ears  and  ages,  as  the  coun- 
try teems  with  her  millions  upon  millions  of  sober,  intelligent.

industrious,  productive  citizens,  and  her  rich  prolific  soil;  and 
especially,  in  times  such  as  we  have  seen  and  passed  through; 
wars  in  Europe,  and  wars  in  our  own  country,  and  our  foreign 
trade  and  commerce,  embargoed  and  cut  up? 

We  refer  to  the  body  of  our  work,  and  leave  the  thoughtful, 
calculating,  sober  citizen,  that  loves  his  country's  prosperity 
and  glory,  to  pore  over  her  future  greatness,  if  she  adheres  to 
her  flag  and  motto,  "  Virtue,  Liberty,  and  Independence."  Let 
our  young  men — thej'-oung'men,  that  every  patriot  and  lover  of 
his  country  delights  to  see  rising  in  the  path  of  honor  and  true 
glory,  and  a  virtuous  lover  of  his  country's  honor  and  true  great- 
ness, study  well  the  history  of  their  country  and  of  its  trade  and 
commerce,  and  the  ramifications  of  its  rich  agricultural,  mine- 
ral, manufacturing,  mechanical,  and  its  literary  pursuits,  and 
learn  to  contribute  their  mite  to  its  grandeur  and  greatness —

This  Association,  organized  in  IS'SG,  under  the  control  o 
a  President,  two  Vice  Presidents,  Treasurer,  Secretary  aiKl 
twenty-one  Directors,  has  for  its  object  the   amicable  adjust- 
ment of  all  difficulties  of  a  business 'onaracter  among  merchants, 
shippers  and  others. 

Reference  may  be  made  to  a  commitlee  of  three,  appointed 
monthly,  who  are  made  known  throagh  the  public  prints,  and 
who  being  selected  for  their  ^general  »ooinTOercial  knowledge, 
"have  as  yet  had  no  appeals  made  Irom  their  decision. 

Although  established  for  so  short  a  time,  many  useful  sug- 
gestions relative  to  the  prosperity  of  the  city,  and  calculated 
to  extend  its  trade  and  commerce,  have  already  originated  in 
it,  and  we  have  more  to  hope  for  from  this  unity  of  action  and 
combined  intelligence  of  our  mercantile  communit}-. 

A  Reading  Room,  containing  the  most  valuable  commercial 
papers  of  the  country,  shipping  iistSjiprices  current,  public  docu- 
ments, &amp;c.,  is  connected  with  the  Institution,  Bnd  its  rooms  are 
used  as  a  Merchant's  Exchange  for  our  city.  Strangers  can  be 
introduced  by  application  to  any  of  the  members  and  have  their 
names  enrolled  for  one  month  without  charge. 

The  Association  holds  its  meeting  on  the  first  Thursday  of 
January,  April,  July  and  October.  The  board  of  managers

This  invaluable  public  improvement,  first  put  in  operation  in 
1827,  already  supplies  a  very  large  part  of  our  city  with  the 
pure  and  wholesome  water  of  the  Allegheny,  and  works  are  in 
progress  by  which  its  utility  will  be  very  much  extended.  The 
Total  cost  of  the  works,  up  to  1841,  has  been  $188,056.

MoYvoiiga\ie\a  Na\\gat\o\\  Company. 

This  Companjs  holding  a  charter  from  the  State,  for  the  im- 
provement of  the  navigation  of  the  Monongahela  River,  have 
already  expended  large  sums  of  money  and  much  labor  upon 
this  enterprising  and  useful  work. 

The  difficulty  cf  procuring  funds  for  the  past  two  years,  has 
prevented  the  advancement  of  the  work  as  rapidly  as  could 
have  been  wished  ;  but  since  the  Stat«  has  authorised  an  ad- 


BUSINESS    DIRECTORY.  79 

ditional  subscription  of  two  thousand  shares  of  stock,  and 
other  advantageous  arrangements  have  been  made,  it  is  tho't 
that  the  first  and  second  locks  will  l)e  completed  daring  the 
present  summer. 

The  advantages  to  the  country  bordering  upon  the  Monon- 
gahela  will  be  immense,  and  particularly  so  to  Brownsville, 
Monongahela  and  Elizabeth  cities. 

The  present  officers  are — T.  Bakewell,  President — Johh 
D.  Davis,  Treasurer. 

Managers. — W.  Eichbaum,  John  Freeman,  L.  Peterson, 
James  May,  J.  W.  Burbridge,  John  Shipton,  John  Anderson,

T\\e  Western  Pewitentiavy. 

This  establishment  built  on  the  Cfothic  plan,  is  situated  on 
Beaver  street,  in  Allegheny  city.  For  utility  in  perfecting  all 
the  ends  of  punishment  as  well  as  for  economy  and  profitable 
results,  it  is,  perhaps,  not  surpassed  by  any  establishment  of  a 
similar  nature  in  the  country.  The  aggregate  profit  from'the 
labor  of  convicts  for  the  last  year,  exceeded  by  several  thou- 
sand dollars,  the  charges  necessar}'^  for  their  maintenance.  The 
report  of  the  attending  physician,  presents  the  singular  fact, 
"  that  our  Penns5dvania  system  of  solitary  confinement,  with 
labor,  is  rather  conducive  than  injurious  to  the  health  of  the 
persons  confined."  The  following  are  the  officers  at  the  pre- 
sent time  :  A.  Beckham,  Warden, 
W.  F.  Irwin,  Physician, 
Rev.  Joseph  Banks,  Moral  Instructor.

Weaving,  shoe  making  and  oakum  picking,  are  the  employ^

to  have  been  the  cause  of  a  large  proportion  of  tlie  crimes  for

T\\e  Wirt  Institute. 

This  Institute  was  formed  in  August,  1837.  The  number  of 
members  at  the  present  time,  is  about  forty.  Any  young  man 
of  correct  moral  deportment,  can  be  admitted  by  paying  twen- 
ty dollars.  This  society  has  established  a  course  of  literary 
and  scientific  lectures  during  the  winter  months,  which  have 
been  well  patronised.  The  proceeds  of  these  lectures  are  de- 
voted to  the  increase  of  the  library,  which,  at  present,  contains 
314  volumes,  and  is  shortly  to  be  much  increased.  The  socie- 
ty meets  in  the  Philo  Hall,  in  Fourth  strc^Bt,  between  Wood 
and  Market  streets.  The  officers  are  elected  semi-annually,  and 
are  at  present  as  follows; 

Prtsident—R.  E.  Sellers. 

Vice  President- — Wm.  Collincrwood. 

Secretary — Thompson  Bell.

Censor — E.  G.  Nicholson. 

Ti\g\\man  Society,  (West.  "UivVxcrsity.) 

'•'Omnia  explorate^  optima  tenete.''- 

This  society  was  founded  in  1822,  and  takes  its  name  from 
the  late  chief  justice  of  Pennsylvania.  The  officers  of  the  In- 
stitution, are  a  President,  Vice  President,  (who  is  also  treasu- 
rer), a  Secretary,  Librarian  and  Censor,  who  are  chosen  month- 
ly. The  Lihrary  is  not  large,  but  the  members  have  followed 
the  spirit  of  their  very  apposite  motto,  by  securing  the  best  and 
most  authoritative  works  on  history,  which,  with  copies  of  tht- 
English  classics,  constitute  their  collection,  in  all  about  500 
volumes. 

The  Hall  of  the  society  is  in  the  S.  E.  corner  of  the  Univer- 
,sity  Building,  in  the  third  story,  and  is  very  neatly  furnished. 

A  very  faithful  portrait  of  the  learned  and  venerable  Provost, 
Dt.  Bruce,  painted  by  J.  Clarenden  Daily,  Esq,  of  Philadel- 
phia hangs  in  the  Hall.  It  is  the  property  of  the  "  Alumni  As- 
sociation" who  are  all  members  of  the  Society.  By  an  article 
of  the  constitution  none  others  but  those  who  have  been  at  some 
period  students  of  the  University,  can  become  members  of  the 
society.  The  fate  of  the  rival  Society  suggested  this  con- 
servative provision,  for  when  the  interests  of  the  different  mem- 
bers of  the  societies  and  the  Institution  to  which  tht-y  belong  are 
not  identical,  sooner  or  later  dissension  will  arise  among  them. 
The  number  of  regular  members  at  the  present  time  is  25.  The 
list  of  Honorary  Members  consists  chiefly  of  those  who  have 
been  ordinary  members,  yet  they  have  given  many  who  arejiow 
in  the  front  rank  of  their  profession  in  the  pulpit  and  the  bar, 
and  some  who  are  in  the  Halls  of  Congress.  The  Society 
meets  every  Fiiday  evening.

"Beiie"&lt;e&gt;\ei\t  Soeietiea  o£  Pittsburgli  and 

Li  the  great  benevolent  operations  of  the  age,  the  citizens  of 
Pittsburgii  and  Allegheny,  and  the  c6unty  generally,  have  al- 
ways manifested  a  most  comraendable  and  zealous  interest.  As 
early  as  the  year  1802,  the  Presbyterian  Synod  at  its  first  meet- 
ing, formed  itself  into  a  society,  whose  object  was  the  dissemi- 
naUon  of  Christian  Education  and  intelligence  among  the  West- 
f  rn  Indians,  and  through  its  exertions  schools  were  established 
among  the  Wy.andots,"the  Alleghenies,  the  Ottowas  and  other 
tribes  in  their  neighborhood.  This  society  was  called  "  The 
Western  Missionary  Society,'*  and  continued  its  operations  for 
some  years.'  The  same  Synod,  in  1831  organized^"  the  West» 
t^rn  Foreign  Pvlissionary  Society,"  which  has  done  much  to  ex- 
tend the  light  of  life  to" the  heathen.  The  Bible  cause,  also  is 
one  in  which  great  exertions  have  been  made  and  great  good  ac- 
complished amongst  us.  The  Pittsburgh  Bible  Society  was  or- 
g'anzed  in  1814,  and  became  an  auxiliary  of  the  American  Bible 
Society  in  1817,  In  this  institution  men  of  all  denominations 
have  united  to  pursue  and  carry  out  the  grand  object  of  spread- 
ing the  Holy  Scriptures  throughout  the  nations  of  the  earth. 
The  Young  Men's  Bible  Society,  organized  in  1817,  likewise 
lent  its  aid  "to  the  same  noble  cause,  and  although  the  original 
plan  of  its  constitution  is  somewhat  changed,  still  pursues  the 
accoiuplishment  of  the  great  ends  of  Christian  benevolence, 
'i  he  Pittsburgh  Fem.ale'Bible  Society,  organized  in  1822,  and 
the  Young  Ladies*  Bible  Society,  organized  in  1830,  together 
have  eontributed  nearly  fivo  thousand  dollars  to  the  parent  in- 
stitution since  their  formation.  In  Allegheny  city  a  female  Bi= 
ble  Society  has  for  a  long  time  existed,  and  this,  together  with 
the  Allegheny  Bible  Society,  an  auxiliary  of  the  Pennsylvania 
Bible  Society,  have  nlso  contributed  largely  to  circulate  the 
^^criptures. 

The  Female  Benevolent  Associations  and  Dorcas  Societiae 
of  our  cities,  many  of  which  have  existed  for  a  long  time,  have 
done  immense  good  in  relieving  the  distresses  of  the  suffering 
poor.  Their  kindness  will  long  be  remembered  by  the  widows 
and  the  fatherless.

The  effects  of  the  "Association  for  promoting  the  observadon 
of  the  Christian  Sabbath,"  are  visible  in  the  quiet  s6lemnity  of 
the  Sabbath,  and  the  great  respect  paid  to  all  the  ordinances  of 
religion.  Indeed,  we  think  we  are  safe  in  asserting,  that  there  is 
not  a  city  in  the  Union,  of  the  same  population,  in  which  as 
great  respect  is  paid  to  the  observation  of  the  one  day  in  seven, 
as  in  our  own. 

Besides  those  societies  in  which  all  without  regard  to  religi- 
gious  denomination,  blend  their  united  efforts,  there  are  associ- 
ations in  almost  every  church  devoted  to  objects  of  benevolence. 
The  Bible,  the  Tract,  the  Missionary,  the  Temperance  causes, 
and  all  charitable  objects  are  promoted  with  a  zealous  good 
will  in  ail  our  churches  and  conoregations.  It  would  exceed 
our  limits,  were  we  to  give  individual  notices  of  them  all,  for 
we  believe  that  there  is  no  one  of  our  religious  bodies,  that  has 
not  several  connected  Vv'ith  it. 

The  Sabbath  Schools  we  have  noticed  as  far  as  lay  in  our 
power,  uj:ider  the  head  of  Churches,  &amp;c.  to  which  we  refer. 

The  glorious  cause  of  Temperance  has  progressed  among  us 
nobly,  wonderfully.  A  branch  of  the  American  Temperance 
Society  has  existed  here  since  1827,  but  it  has  not  been  until 
within  the  last  year,  that  the  reformation  has  proceeded  with 
such  giant  strides,  as  to  overcome  all  opposition.  We  are  un- 
able to  procure  the  exact  number  that  are  members  of  the  differ- 
ent Temperance  Societies  in  this  and  Allegheny  city,  but  from 
all  the  information  we  can  procure,  we  believe  the  number  to 
exceed  ten  thousand.  This  great  and  happy  change  in  the  hab- 
its of  our  community,  may  be  attributed  to  the  exertions  of  ma- 
ny of  our  citizens,  assisted  more  recently  by  the  labors  of  dele- 
gates from  the  Washington  Society  of  Baltimore.  The  spirit 
of  Father  Mathew,  the  Irish  apostle  of  Temperance,  seems  to 
have  sped  over  the  waters  to  our  land,  and  to  have  alighted  not 
only  upon  the  clergy  of  his  own  denomination  but  upon  those  of 
all  denominations,  and  the  good  work  has  gone  on  triumphant- 
ly. 

In  conclusion,  it  appears  evident  that  the  march  of  intellect- 
ual and  moral  improvement  is  onward  in  our  midst,  and  that  a 
universal  desire  to  speed  its  progress  fills  the  minds  and  hearts 
of  our  citizens.  Let  these  good  works  advance  and  prosper 
until  the  wine  cup  shall  be  labelled  "poison,"  until  the  Bible 
shall  be  in  the  hands  of  all,  until  the  "  sun  of  righteousness" 
shall  shed  his  rays  on  every  darkened  mind.

books  were  adopted,  as  the  difficulties  of  changing  books  with 
every  new  teacher,  are  an  incalculable  drawback  to  the  scholar,

prrrsBURGH  in  olden  time— the  contrast. 

We  have  selected  from  Cramer,  Spear  &amp;  Eichbaum's  excel- 
lent Magazine  Almanac,  the  first  view  of  the  business  of  Pitts- 
burgh, which,  with  our  early  history  of  it,  will  furnish  a  faith- 
ful contrast,  and  show  how  v^e  commenced,  progressed,  and 
our  present  business. 

Pittsburgh,  September  23,  1803. 

Upon  a  rough  calculation,  we  find  that  the  imports   to  this 

place  for  the  last  twelve  months   of  merchandize   of  various 

kinds  amount  to  two  hundred  and  fifty  tliousand  dollars.     And 

the  amount  of  the  exports  of  flour,  whiskey,  bar-iron,  castings. 


IS2  HAREIS'    GENERAL 

d^,  from  ih^  neighborhood  of  Pittsburgh,  about  one  hundred 
and  eighty  thousand;  so  that  we  find  ourselves  in  debt  no  Icsi. 
iimii  BO  verity  thouscind  dollars,  This  year  we  are  flattered  with 
th©  hope  of  a  better  market  for  our  produce;  the  lightness  of  the 
crops  however  will  acareely  make  up  the  deficiency.  So  thatX 
gee  but  little  prospect  of  g^elting  rid  of  this  already  accumulated 
dabt  for  two  years  to  come.  For  every  corner  and  hole  in  thi&amp; 
Vt^estern  country,  if  they  be  not  already  filled  with  foreign  ex- 
tmvaganceg,  they  cannot  long  remain  so,  To  see  miles  togeth- 
er of  the  mountains  lined  with  waggons,  you  would  be  dispos- , 
f'd  to  presume  either  that  their  contents  were  lost  to  the  right 
owners,  or  that  the  bov/ek  of  the  country  must  groan  with 
minm  of  gold  equal  to  those  of  Peru,  It  is  known  to  but  a  few: 
how  m  many  debts  are  paid  off  as  really  are.  Where  the  mo- 
ney com.es  from  God  knows.  To  visit  the  coimtry — to  hear 
ih©  cries  of  the  widow  and  fatherless — to  see  their  property  torn 
from  them  by  the  rugged  hand  of  the  law—- exposed  to  sale — ^ 
the  crier  oneB-^who'lfhuy! — and  perhaps  it  is  the  last  bed  that 
a  delicate  female  has  to  sleep  on — ^or  a  cow,  the  only  support 
of  a  numerous  and  helpless  famUy  of  children.  The  picture  is 
%Q(i  alarming— we  will  let  the  curtain  fall  for  a  moment,  and 
w^iJt  ^h^  event  of  time.

The  following  enumeration  of  the  manufactories,  artists  and 
mechanics  of  Pittsburgh,  Vv'ill  give  a  tolerable  good  idea  of  the 
progress  of  the  place. — Perhaps  no  place  of  the  same  size  in 
the  U.  S.  could  turn  out  so  many  industrious  artisans,  and  it  is 
believed  we  bid  the  fairest  to  become  the  most  considerble  man- 
ufacturing people,  fur  an  interior  tow^n,  in  the  Union.  The 
natural  situation  of  the  place  must  push  us  on  to  this  point — and 
the  local  advantages  attending  us,  are  uncommonly  numerous, 
and  peculiarly  adapted  for  our  convenience.  In  a  few  years  we 
hope  to  see  all  heavy  articles  in  iron,  brass,  copper,  &amp;c.,  man- 
ufactured among  ourselves — It  wants  nothing  now  to  accom- 
plish this,  but  a  few  spirited  and  monied  men  to  set  the  thing 
on  foot,  and  give  countenance  to  the  enterprise.  There  are 
many  articles  daily  floating  over  the  mountains  w^hich 
helps  to  drain  the  country  of  money  to  pay  for  them,  and 
which  might  as  easily  be  made  here,  as  a  common  horse  shoe, 
were  the  proper  steps  taken.  There  is,  at  least  20,000  dollars 
worth  of  hardware  sold  out  of  our  stores  annually,  which  ought 
to  be  m-ade  on  the  spot.  The  principal  of  these  articles  are, 
scythes,  sickles,  spades,  shovels,  fiat  irons,  drawing  knives, 
carpenter's  squares,  hand  and  mill  saws,  currycombs,  coffee 
mills,  chissels,  gimlets,  hammers,  shovels  and  tongs,  handirons 
fenders,  knives  and  forks,  bridle  bits,  mounting  for  cabinet 
w"ork,  &amp;c.,  augurs  and  many  other  articles  not  recollected — 
And  there  might  be  $20,000  saved  in  the  article  of  delf,  and 
as  much  more  in  the  article  of  fine  glass,  all  of  which  might  be 
manufactured  in  the  town,  and  wants  nothing  but  a  public  spir- 
it in  the  citizens  to  accomplish  it.  Let  the  public  spirit  exist, 
and  the  object  is  nearly  accomplished,  nothing  but  this  is  want- 
ing— money,  materials,  and  workmen  are  at  hand.  We  can 
only  hope  and  pray  that  the  propriety  and  advantages  of  these 
things  may  be  looked  into. 

The    population   and    buildings,  are   also  increasing  very

rapidly — In  1806  there  were  built  about  80  dwellings — this 
season,  1807,  about  100  is  on  the  way.  It  was  our  intention  to 
have  taken  an  exact  enumeration  of  all  the  inhabitants.  Cir- 
cumstances, however,  prevented  us;  but  we  will  try  this  object 
for  our  next  year's  Almanac,  and,  at  present,  present  our  rea- 
ders with  the  number  of  tlie  Master  Workmen  in  each  particu- 
lar branch  of  business  carried  on  in  Pittsburgh:  we  have  tried 
to  get  the  statement  as  correct  as  possible,  if  any  mistakes 
should  have  occurred,  wo  hope  they  will  be  pointed  out  to  us, 
with  a  communication  of  any  other  information  which  may  be 
deemed  worthy  of  notice,  and  to  the  advancement  of  our  manu- 
facturing interest. 

MANUFACTORIES,     ARTISTS    AND    MECHANICS. 

1  Cotton  manufactory,  which  cards,  spins  and  weaves  an 
immense  quantity  of  beautiful  cotton  yearly,  and  to  the  great 
credit  and  profit  of  its  industrious  proprietor.  It  has  one  mule 
which  spins  at  once  120  threads,  with  the  assistance  of  one  man 
and  a  boy;  and  one  spinning  jenny  of  40  threads;  4  looms,  one 
of  which  is  3^  yards  broad,  for  ticking,  &amp;c.  A  wool  carding 
machine  is  carried  on  under  the  same  roof. 

1  Green  glass  works  opposite  the  town,  which  makes  an  im- 
mense quantity  of  window  glass,  bottles,  jars,  &amp;c.,  annually. 

2  Breweries. 

1  Air  furnace,  at  which  are  cast  pots,  kettles,  mill-irons,  flat- 
irons,  &amp;c. 

4  Nail  manufactories,  cut  and  wrought. 

7  Coppersmiths,  and  tinplate  workers — two  of  these  carry 
on  the  japanning  largely,  and  one  planishes  equal  in  appear- 
ance to  silver.

THE  ALLEGHENY  RIVER  TRADE  AND  COM- 
MERCE. 

This  beautiful  river  that  comes  from  the  great  and  populous 
state  of  New  York,  and  mingles  with  the  Monongahela  at  Pitts- 
burgh, forming  the  Ohio  River,  is  becoming  daily  more  impor- 
tant in  its  trade,  and  we  find  it  difficult  to  give  even  a  faint  idea 
of  its  growing  business,  as  no  collector  or  register  has  been  ap- 
pointed to  make  a  record  of  its  commerce.     In  our  early  day  a 
few  flat  and  keel  boats,  and  the  Luliayi  canoe  done  all  the  busi- 
ness on  it.     We  then  sent  up  all  the  flour,  meat,  whiskey  and 
many  articles  of  trade,  used  by  the  inhabitants,  along  the  river 
and  its  numerous  tributaries.     The  state  of  Michigan  and  the 
I  Army  of  the  U.  States  at  Detroit,  Michilimackinack,  &amp;c.,  was 
supplied  with  provisions  that  went  from  Pittsburgh  to  Franklin, 
then  by  French  Creek  to  Waterford,  thence  in  waggons  to  Erie, 
and  from  the  thence  in  ships  on  Lake  Erie.     All  the  salt  used 
in  Pittsburgh  and  the  western  country,  was  brought  from  the 
Canandaigua  salt  works,  New  York,  by  way  of  Erie,  French 
Creek  and  the  Allegheny  river,  and  sold  at,  from  ten  to  twenty 
dollars  a  barrel.     NoW  the  scene  has  changed,  and  on  looking 
at  the  business  of  Jamestown,  N.  Y.,  and  Warren,  Pa.,  the  rich 
products  and  business  of  the  French  Creek  valley,  from  Mead- 
ville  down,  and  the  great  iron  establishments  in  Venango  and 
Armstrong  counties    and  the  immense  lumber  trade  of    the 
Allegheny,  it  will  be  seen  that  they  have  become  heavy  export- 
ers, coming  to  Pittsburgh,  and  passing  down  the  Ohio  to  Wheel- 
ing, Cincinnati,  Louisville  and  New  Orleans,  St.  Louis  and  all 
intermediate  ports — with  their  trade,  produce  and  manufactures; 
from  the  Allegheny  and  tributaries   down  from   Olean,  Kiske- 
minitas,  Conewango,  French  Creek,  Clarion  river,   &amp;:c.   &amp;c. 
They  take  up  annually  a  great  many  Pittsburgh  manufactures, 
groceries  and  foreign  and  domestic  goods,  and  bring  down  a  vast 
deal  of  all  kinds  of  lumber,  logs  and  shingles,  pot  and  pearl  ash- 
es, whiskey,  cheese,   cabinet  ware,  patent  tubs  and  buckets, 
hay,  oats,  potatoes,  hoop  poles,  bark,  &amp;c.  &amp;c.,  and  large  quan- 
tities of  salt  from  the  Kiskiminitas,  and  a  vast  quantity  of  pig 
metal  from  Venango  and  Armstrong  counties.     From  three  to 
six  steam  boats  now  ply  on  the  Allegheny  to  Freeport,  Kittan- 
ning,  Franklin,  Warren,  and  back.     In  the  last  two  years  they 
have  made  about  500   trips,  up  and  down.       The   folio-wing 
steam  boats  have  been  engaged   in  the  Allegheny  river  trade, 
viz.  Elizabeth,  Pulaski,  Forrest,  Beaver,  Pauline,  (now  with- 
drawn, and  the  Orphan  Boy  to  replace  her)    and   occasionally 
the  Izaak  Walton.     In  the  summer  season,  when  the  river  is 
low,  several  small  keel  and  flat  boats  are   employed   to  do  the 
carrying  trade.     About  400  very  large  arks,  or  flat  boats,  from 
65  to  120  feet  long,  come  down  the  Allegheny  annually,  loaded 
with  lumber  and  produce.      The   boats  are   generally  sold   at 


136  Harris'  general

Cincinnati,  Louisville,  Natchez  and  intermediate  ports.

In  collecting  and  arranging  for  publication,  the  business  sta- 
tistics of  a  great  commercial  city  like  our  own,  it  must  necessa- 
rily occur  that  slight  errors  will  arise,  both  from  the  difficulty 
in  many  cases  of  procuring  accurate  information,  and  also  from 
those  mistakes  to  which  the  Press  is  always  liable.  Our  ex- 
ertions, however,  have  been  unremitted  and  we  confidently  be- 
lieve that  the  preceding  pages  present  as  comprehensive  and 
concise,  and  at  the  same  time,  as  fair  and  impartial  a  view  of 
the  manufactures,  trade,  commerce  and  general  business  inter* 
ests  of  our  large  and  rapidly  improving  city  as  it  is  possible  to 
comprehend  in  a  w^ork  of  the  design  and  extent  of  the  present. 

In  glancing  back  through  the  medium  of  history  as  we  have 
done,  and  comparing  Pittsburgh  as  it -at  present  appears,  and  as 
it  was  forty  years  ago,  the  fact  forcibly  presents  itself  to  the 
mind,  that  not  only  its  position  at  the  starting  point  of  the 
greatest  continued  extent  of  inland  navigation  in  the  word,  have 
fostered  its  growth  and  drawn  wealth  to  the  coffers  of  its  inhabi- 
tants, but  that  the  character  which  our  citizens  have  always  main- 
tained for  industry  and  economy,  has  likewise  been  a  philoso- 
pher's stone  which  has  turned  our  coal,  and  iron,  and  timber  into 
gold.  The  faces  of  many  of  our  citizens  who  are  now  worth 
their  tens  of  thousands,  were  once  blackened  by  the  smoke  of 
the  furnaces  which  they  now  own,  and  some  who  now  ride  in 
their  carriages,  might  once  have  been  seen  driving  drays.  Tlie 
advantages  of  a  man's  own  individual  exertion  in  raising  him- 
■  self  to  competence  and  a  respectable  station  in  society,  has  tru- 
ly been  exemplified  in  our  city. 

The  scholar,  the  antiquarian  and  the  poet  may  also  find  much 
to  please  and  interest  in  our  neighborhood,  for  we  are  located 
on  classic  ground.  Here  were  the  sites  of  old  Fort  Pitt  and 
Du  Quesne,  and  a  few  miles  distant  amid  the  bold  and  beauti- 
fully varied  scenery  by  which  we  are  surrounded,  are  Brad- 
dock's  Field  and  the  site  of  old  Fort  Mcintosh,  all  of  them  loca- 
lities which  are  associated  with  the  names  of  such  men  as 
Wayne,  Braddock,  Mcintosh  and  Washington,  who  were  all 
here  in  the  infancy  of  our  city,  and  whose  deeds  contributed  so 
iargely  to  the  early  prosperity  of  this  portion  of  our  country. 


BUSINESS    DIRKCTORV.  131 

The  literarj'  man,  and  we  have  many  among  us,  could  scarcely 
choose  a  spot  in  tho  west  more  suited  totho  gratification  of  his 
lastfis,  than  the  neighborhood  of  our  city. 

And  with  such  facilities  as  we  have  shown  that  it  has,  it  it* 
impossible  to  predict  what  may  be  its  future  greatnes^^.  Wheu 
we  walk  along  our  streets  and  see  rows  of  warehouses  ani 
»*plendid  mansions,  where  within  the  memory  of  many  now  liv- 
ing, the  log-  cabin  was  the  only  dwelling,  and  when  along  our 
Avharves  we  see  rows  of  noble  steamboats  where  the  arrival  oi 
a  single  keel  boat  mice  attracted  t^e  attention  of  half  the  then 
population,  we  are  filled  with  wonder  .at  the  improvement 
which  labor  and  mechanical  science  have  made  in  the  condition 
and  happiness  of  our  population,  and  we  look  forward  to  results 
still  more  wonderful.  Indeed,  we  do  not  think  we  over  esti- 
mate the  resources  of  our  location  and  the  enterprising  business 
character  of  our  community,  when  we  predict  that  Pittsburgh 
will  one  day  be  the  greatest  manufacturing  city  on  the  western 
continent,  if  not  in  the  world.

"WUkiiasburgTa. 


Wilkinsburgh  is  pleasantly  situated  near  the  Pennsylvania 
turnpike,  leading  to  Greensburgh,  Chambersburgh  and  Phila- 
delphia; the  Northern  turnpike  leading  to  Blairsville,  Hunting- 
ton, and  Harrisburgh  intersects  this,  near  this  place. 

About  two  and  a  half  miles  south  is  the  celebrated  Braddock's 
Fields  on  the  Monongahela  river,  a  place  interesting  for  its  his- 
torical reminiscence.  For  a  long  time  the  prosperity  of  this 
delightful  village  was  paralized  and  its  inhabitants  dishearten- 
ed by  litigations  attending  uncertain  titles  to  the  soil,  but  now, 
since  this  serious  difficulty  has  been  removed,  a  new  impetus 
has  been  given  to  business,  good  buildings  are  being  erected, 
important  improvements  are  making,  and  Wilkinsburgh  is  be- 
coming one  of  the  most  beautiful  and  desirable  locations  for 
country  seats  in  our  neighborhood.  There  are  many  flourish- 
ing farms  and  gardens  in  and  around  it,  and  within  a  mile  of  the 


154  HARRIS*^    GENERAL 

village  the  Hon.  Wm  Wilkins,  cur  late  ambassador  to  Rus- 
sia, has  a  most  charming  country  seat.  Mr.  Wm  Peebles,  Ma- 
jor A  Horback,  and  several  others  have  pleasant  country  resi- 
dences in  this  neighborhood. 

There  is  much  travel  through  this  place,  especially  in  winter, 
when  other  transportation  being  closed,  the  freights  between 
Baltimore,  Philadelphia  and  Pittsburgh,  are  carried  by  wag- 
gons, large  numbers  of  which  pass  through  this  place.  Ther* 
are  two  Hotels,  two  merchants,  a  Post  Office,  a  church,  a  school 
house,  and  several  industrious  mechanics  in  the  place.  A  large 
quantity  of  lime  is  made  in  this  vicinity,  much  of  which  is 
brought  to  Pittsburgh.

This  village  is  pleasantly  situated  about  two  miles  east  of 
Pittsburgh,  on  a  new  turnpike  road,  which  passes  through  it 
tVom  Pittsburgh  to  East  Liberty.  It  is  the  dwelling  place  of  a 
number  of  verv  respectable  families,  whose  neat  houst^^s  and 
flourishing  farms  and  gardens,  and  other  choice  improvements, 
surrounded  by  the  naturally  picturesque  scenery,  render  it  a 
very  desirable  residence.  There  are  some  of  the  best  coal 
pits  in  our  vicinity  here,  and  many  coal  dealers  and  waggoners 
^reside  in  the  neighborhood.  There  are  two  churches,  (Presby- 
terian and  Welsh)  with  Sabbath  schools  attached,  in  the  vil- 
lage, and  the  population  is  sober,  intelligent  and  industriouB. 
We  have  seen,  on  a  Sabbath  evening,  both  these  houses  of 
worship,  which  are  within  one  hundred  feet  of  each  other, 
orowded  to  overflowing,  with  their  respective  congregations. 
As  much  mining  is  done  here,  a  large  proportion  of  the  inhabi-

THE  NEW  COURT  HOUSE. 

This  immense  work  is  now  completed.  It  is  situated  on 
Crant's  Hill,  on  a  lot  formerly  the  property  of  James  Ross,  Esq. 
This  edifice  stands  on  an  eminence  so  high  above  the  city  as  to 
afford  an  extensive  and  beautiful  view  of  the  hills  and  valleys 
of  the  three  rivers — the  Allegheny,  the  Monongahela  and  the 
Ohio,  with  all  the  towns  and  villages  for  miles  around.  The 
architecture  is  of  the  Grecian  Doric  order,  a  style  the  most  no- 
ble and  imposing  left  us  as  a  legacy  by  the  ancients.  The  ruins 
of  Paestum  and  Sie  Parthenon  at  Athens  contain  the  finest  spe^ 
cimens  of  this  class — the  wonder  and  admiration  of  all  modern 
travelers. 

The  main  front  is-divided  into  a  hexa-style  portico,  and  two 


BUSINESS   DIRECTOR*-.  161 

pseiulo  peripteral  wings.  The  building  is  165  feet  long,  and 
100  feet  broad,  and  is  connected  with  the  jail  in  the  rear.. 

The  basement  contains  8  rooms,  4  of  which  are  32  by  25  feet 
rach,  and  the  other  4  are  15  by  32  feet  each.  These  are  used 
for  public  offices;  the  prothonotary  and  recorder  occupy  the  two 
in  front,  and  the  commissioners,  clerk  of  sessions,  -fee.  those 
in  the  rear.  The  whole  of  this  story  is  made  fire  proof  with 
groined  arches,  and  makes  a  safe  depository  for  the  public  re- 
cords. These  rooms  are  connected  with  each  other  by  commo- 
dious passages,  12  feet  in  width. 

The  principal  story  contains  a  rotunda  60  feet  in  diameter,  4 
court  rooms,  about  45  feet  square  each,  and  two  jury  rooms, 
each  20  by  18  feet.  Each  court  room  is  connected  with  the  ro- 
tunda by  two  entrances,  the  one  for  the  members  of  the  bar,  and 
the  other  for  the  public. 

The  rotunda  is  50  feet  high  to  the  base  of  the  dome,  which  is 
supported  by  8  Corinthian  columns.  The  dome  at  the  base,  is 
'37  feet  in  diameter,  and  is  finished  on  the  top  by  a  lantern;  from 
the  highest  part  of  which  inside,  to  the  floor  of  the  rotunda,  is 
128  feet.  The  ceiling  of  the  dome  is  exceedingly  beautiful, 
being  executed  in  stucco  work  with  enriched  paneling.  In  the, 
base  of  the  dome  are  8  circular  headed  v/indows,  which  throw 
a  softened  and  subdued  light  into  the  rotunda. 

The  second  story  is  connected  with  the  rotunda  by  three  stone 
stair  cases;  the  main  one  is  lighted  from  a  small  cupola  which, 
witli  the  ceilings  of  the  s'air  case,  exhibits  richly  ornamented 
stueco  work.  This  story  contains  5  rooms  on  each  side.  The 
eastern  side  is  appropriated  to  the  District  Court  of  the  U.  S.  by 
which  it  is  already  occupied,  and  furnished  in  the  finest  style. 
•On  the  west  side  are  the  rooms  for  the  Supreme  Court  of  Penn- 
sylvania, the  public  library,  the  judges,  grand  and  petit  jury, 
Each  set  of  rooms  is  approached  by  a  spacious  corridor,  12  feet 
wide,  and  running  the  whole  depth  of  the  building,  which  gives 
to  these  appartments  a  high  degree  of  elegance  and  commo- 
diousness. 

The  height  of  the  principal  stor\'  is  20  feet,  that  of  the  second 
story,  15  feet;  and  from  tlie  floor  of  the  basement  to  that  of  the 
principal  story,  is  13  feet. 

The  floor  of  the  portico  will  be  20  feet  above  Grant  street 
when  graded,  and  is  gaiued  by  two  flights  of  stone  steps  in  ffont. 
Here  stand  10  massive  columns,  33  feet  high  and  5  feet  10  in- 
ches in  diameter;  These  are  of  solid  stone  and  fluted,  and  with 
their  capitals  are  finely  polished.  From  the  level  of  Grant  street 
■  when  graded,  to  the  top  of  the  lantern  is  148  feet.  The  Court 
House  and  Jail  stand  upon  a  lot  240  feet  square,  both  are  built 
of  sand  stone  from  quarries  in  this  vicinity.  The  principal 
fronts  of  both  are  enriched  and  polished. 

The  Court  House  has  been  in  tbe  progress  of  erection  for 
about  five  years,  at  a  cost  of  near  $200,000,  and  is  pronounced 
*14

EXCHANGE  HOTEL, 

Corner  of  tSL  Clair  and  Penn  Streets, 

Near  the  Allegheny  Bridge. 

M'KIBBEN  &amp;  SMITH,  Proprietors. 

We  have  recently  made  a  business  visit  to  this  extensive 
house,  kept  by  M'Kibben  &amp;  Smith,  two  experienced  gentlemen 
who  have  long  kept  Hotels.  They  moved  into  the  Exchange 
Hotel  on  the  1st  of  April,  1840,  having  first  made  a  great  ma- 
ny useful  repairs  and  improvements,  fresh  papering,  flooring. 
Carpeting,  and  furnishing  this  large  establishment  with  an  en- 
tire new  stock  of  the  very  best  furniture,  made  by  our  Pitts- 
fiurgh  mechanics.  We  ])assed  through  it,  and  found  the  bed- 
rooms, chambers  and  parlors  furnished  and  got  up  in  the  very 
best  style,  and  the  beds  and  bedding  of  the  first  order,  clean  and 
aeat  and  the  rooms  large  and  airy.  Anew  dining  room  for  la- 
dies is  about  to  be  made  on  the  first  floor,  near  the  large  dining 
room,  which  is  also  to  receive  a  new  finish.  There  are  besides 
the  largo  double  reading  rooms  down  stairs,  six  parlors,  and 
from  seventy  to  eighty  double  and  single  bedrooms,  an  excellent 
ice  house,  a  good  bathing  house  at  Concert  Hall,  just  opposite, 
established  for  the  accommodatton  of  guests  at  the  Exchange, 
and  large  roomy  stables,  kept  by  J  &amp;  J  Mathews,  near  it.  The 
Exchange  Hotel,  wo  are  assured  by  the  most  respectable  gen- 
tlemen who  are  boarding  in  it,  and  by  many  respectable  stran- 
gers and  travelers,  is  kept  in  the  very  best  manner,  and  one  in- 
telligent merchant  who  travels  a  good  deal  in  the  Eastern  cities, 
assured  us  it  was  hardly  surpassed  in  the  United  States.  The 
tables  arc  excellent  and  richly  provided  with  tlie  best  fare:  the 
servants  are  attentive  and  accommodating,  and  150  persons  can 
be  genteely  accommodated  in  it.  This  large  and  spacious 
Hotel  was  built  by  the  late  John  M'Donald,  Esq.,  and  lately 
purchased  by  Col.  Wm  Robinson,  for  45,000,  who  rented  it  to 
M'Kibben  and  Smith  on  a  lease  for  $5,000  per  annum.  Those 
gentlemen  relet  the  stables,  stage  and  other  offices,  canal  pac- 
ket, barber  shops,  &amp;c,,  for  about  $2000,  reducing  their  rent  to 
$3000  a  year.     In  order  t^  do  justice  to  our  mechanics,  we  no-

MOx\OI\GAHEI^A  HOUSE, 

Corner  of  Watpr^  Sinithjield  and  Front  sts. 

Near  the  Monongahela  Bridge. 

JAMES  CROSSAN,  Proprietor. 
We  have  taken  some  pride  in  noticing  the  improvements  of 
Pittsburgh  from  time  to'time,  and  now  have  the  pleasure  of  pre- 
senting to  the  public  a  particular  account  of  the  large  new  Ho- 
tel, which  was  commenced  early  in  the  year  1840,  at  the  cor- 
ners of  Water,  Smithfield  &amp;  Front  streets,  and  was  finished  in 
the  spring  of  the  present  year.  It  occupies  120  feet  on  botli 
Water  and  Front  streets,  and  160  feet  on  Smithfield  street,  and 
is  5  stories  high,  the  roof  is  covered  with  iron,  with  a  beautiful 
terrace  on  the  top,  making  a  delightful  walk  and  view  of  tlin 
city,  rivers,  and  the  arrival  and  departures  of  steamboats  and 
all  the  river  business  with  surrounding  scenery.  The  cellar  has 
five  apartments  for  washing,  dressing,  mangling  and  drying 
clothes;  two  large  ice  houses,  one  for  the  use  of  the  bar  and  ta- 
ble and  the  other  for  the  kitchen  and  cooking  departments,  with 
a  variety  of  rooms  for  fuel  and  for  the  accommodation  of  the 
several  offices,  &amp;c.  &amp;c.  In  the  first  story,  which  is  level  witl» 
the  street,  there  are  twelve  good  store  rooms  and  offices  ou 
Water  and  Smithfield  streets;  the  entrance  for  ladies  to  the  Ho- 
tel from  Smithfield,  and  for  gentlemen  from  Water  street.  A 
bar  room  42  by  38  feet,  a  kitchen  38  by  28  feet;  a  court  G7  by 
56  feet,  with  an  elegant  Grecian  portico  in  front  of  the  Hotel 
on  Water  street,  and  a  porch  all  around  the  court  on  the  first 
floor  and  level  with  the  dining  room,  and  an  area  under  the  court 
on  three  sides. 

On  the  second  story  there  is  a  receiving  room  directly  above 
the  bar  room,  28  by  18  feet;  a  dining  room  for  gentlemen,  7f) 
feet  by  29 — 13^  feet  high,  and  a  dining  room  for   ladies  66  by 


164  HARRIS'    GENERAL 

16  feet  and  the  same  height;  13  parlors,  divided  by  folding; 
doors,  two  lobbies  and  three  beautiful  Terraces  in  front  on  Wa- 
ter street.  The  cellar  is  9i,  the  1st  and  3d  stories  11,  the  4th 
story  10,  and  the  5th  story  7  feet  3  inches  high.  On  the  2d,  3d, 
4th,  and  5th  stories  (the  three  last  being  laid  out  in  sleeping 
rooms)  there  are  altogether  210  bed  rooms,  small  or  single  9  by 
18,  and  larger  double  bed  rooms  18  by  18  feet  each. 

There  are  205  outside  windows  and  about  207  inside,  mak- 
ing altogether  about  412  windows  in  the  building.  This  splen- 
did Hotel,  is  a  vast  addition  to  the  public  accommodations  of 
■Pittsburgh,  and  vies  with  any  thing  of  the  kind  in  the  interior, 
or  perhaps  in  the  Union.  It  is  the  property  of  four  wealthy  and 
respectable  gentlemen,  and  with  the  ground  on  which  it  is 
erected  will  cost  about  one  hundred  thousand  dollars.  Mr  James 
Crossan,  so  long  known  as  the  keeper  of  the  Exchange,  occu- 
pies and  keeps  it.  In  order  to  do  justice  to  the  artist  who  plan- 
ned and  superintended  the  work — Mr.  James  Kerr,  Architect, 
who  very  kindly  showed  us  his  plans  and  drawings,  and  to  the 
mechanics  and  builders  who  erected  it,  we  close  with  their 
names. 

Stone  Masons — Pagan,  Alston  and  Swan.  Brick  Mason — 
Thomas  Simmons.  Carpenters — Vodges,  J  Dilworth,  Scott 
and  Gay.  Plasterer — George  Bassett.  Painter — Samuel  M'- 
Kinlcy.  The  Terrace  and  Iron  work — Vincent  A  Brown.  We 
wish  the  owners  and  proprietors  of  this  very  splendid  establish- 
ment that  success  which  their  enterprize  merits. 


POPULATION  OF  PITTSBURGH,  ALLEGHENY 
AND  THEIR  ENVIRONS. 

^Many  of  those  extensive  manufactories,  the  products  of  which 
-are  so  extensively  and  so  favorably  known,  not  only  through- 
out the  United  States,  but  also  in  Mexico,  Guatamala,  West 
Indies,  and  the  northern  part  of  South  America,  although  at  vi 
distance  they  are  spoken  of  as  being  situated  at  Pittsburgh,  are 
not  within  the  limits  of  the  city  proper,  as  might  at  once  be 
■supposed  when  its  location  upon  a  point  of  land  between  two  riv- 
ers is  considered,  but  are  scattered  around  within  a  circle  of  five 
miles,  the  centre  of  which  might  be  placed  at  the  Court  House. 
Within  this  compass  are  the  cities  of  Pittsburgh  and  Alleghe- 
ny, (the  latter  already  a  large  place  of  near  12,000  inhabitants, 
containing  many  extensive  manufactories,  particularly  of  cot- 
ton, iron  and  white  lead,  and  doing  a  large  proportion  of  the 
lumber  business  of  the  district,)  the  boroughs  of  Birmingham 
and  Law-renceville,  &amp;  the  towns  &amp;  villages  of  Manchester,  Stew- 
artstown,  Sharpsburgh,  E.  Liberty,  Wilkinsburgh,  Croghans- 
ville,  Minersville,  Arthursville,  Riceville,Oakland,  Kensington, 
Sligo,  Cuddysville,  Temperance  village,  Millersville  and  New 


BUSINESS    DIRECTORY*  165 

Troy.  The  manufacturing  establishments  located  in  these  sur- 
round ing^  villages,  have  their  Warehouses,  owners  or  agents 
within  the  city,  and  so  tar  as  general  business  interests  are 
concerned,  may  be  considered  a  part  of  the  city  itself,  that  be- 
ing the  centre  point  where  the  greater  part  of  the  business  is 
transacted.  The  population  within  this  region  we  estimated 
in  a  former  work  at  00,000,  since  the  census  of  1810  it  is  found 
that  that  estimate  was  too  large.  At  page  121  of  this  work,  it 
will  be  seen  that  the  population  of  Allegheny  county  is,  w^hites 
81,417 — colored  2,101 — Total  83,518.  Upon  consulting  witli 
our  County  Commissioners,  we  received  it  as  their  opinion 
that  within  the  district  above  laid  down,  50,000  of  this  popula- 
tion reside.  This  estimate  in  our  opinion  is  full  small  enough, 
when  we  look  at  the  size  of  the  largest  towns  in  other  parts  of 
the  country  compared  with  those  immediately  around  us.  How- 
ever this  is  a  matter  of  no  great  moment,  as  it  is  allowed  by  all 
hands  that  there  is  not  a  more  industrious  and  flourishing  com- 
munity in  the  West  than  our  own.  Within  this  district  there 
are  likewise  about  seventy-five  churches,  or  places  where  reli- 
gious worship  is  held  upon  the  Sabbath — about  90  Sabbath 
schools,  98  clergymen  of  all  denominations,  95  lawyers,  65 
practising  physicians,  besides  many  who  have  retired  from 
practice,  about  475  merchants  of  all  kinds,  about  100  of 
whom  are  wholesale,  and  325  hotels  and  tavern  keepers. 

Any  important  errors  or  omissions,  which  we  may  discover  in 
the  foregoing  part  of  the  work,  will  be  corrected  at  the  close.

RELIANCE  PORTABLE  BOAT  COMPANY. 


Line  of  Iron  Boats 


I 


Por  the  Transportation  of  Goods  be-' 
tween  Philadelphia  ^  Pittsburgh. 

This  iiiiflrovement  secures  to  Merchants  important  advanta- 
ges, as  goods  placed  in  the  Boats  at  one  point,  are  never  remo- 
ved until  they  reach  the  warehouse  at  the  other.  Thus  dispen- 
sing with  the  risk  and  delay  of  transhipment  at  three  different 
points  on  the  route.  Careful  and  experienced  Captains  and 
crews  are  employed,  who  occompany  the  boats  the  whole  dis- 
tance. 

The  Boats  are  built  in  sections,  which  are  seperated  on  their 
Jirrival  at  the  Portage  and  Columbia  Rail  Roads,  transferred 
from  the  water  upon  Cars  to  the  road,  and  continue  their  course 
by  the  agency  of  steam  power. 

Owing  to  the  peculiar  construction  of  the  Boats,  the  risk  of 
damage  to  goods  is  but  trifling,  as  it  is  impossible  to  injure 
more  than  one  section  at  any  one  time;  and  their  light  draught 
enables  them  to  perfonn  their  trips  in  from  three  to  four  dayis 
less  than  by  any  other  mode. 

The  company  solicit  a  continuance  of  the  increasing  patron- 
age they  have  experienced  for  the  past  two  years,  and  their 
friends  may  depend  upon  their  business  being  done  upon  as  fair 
and  liberal  terms  as  by  any  other  line. 

Goods  consigned  to  either  of  the  following  houses  will  be 
despatched  without  delay,  and  all  freights  and  charges  paid 
when  required.

e.  e.  BRISTOL, 

D'Mggist  and    Chemical  Laboratpry, 
2011,  Main  Street,  Buffalo. 

Proprietor  of  Bristol's  Extract  of  SarsapariHa  for  parifying 
the  blood.  The  following  is  sufficient  testimony  to  satisfy  the 
most  incredulous:— 

"This  is  to  certify,  that  I,  Jane  Demee,  aged  32  years,  resi- 
ding at  No.  20,  Main  street,  in  the  city  of  Utica,  was  attacked 
about  five  years  since,  with  scrofula,  which  terminated  in  scro- 
fulous cancer*  For  the  first  four  years  I  was  attended  by  sev- 
eral physicians,  and  took  during  the  time 

14  bottles  Phoenix  Bitters, 
20  boxes  Life  Pills, 
100       "     Brandreth's  (genuine)  do. 

3  bottles  Phelp's  Arcanum, 

4  "        Smith's  An ti- Mercurial  Syrup, 

5  '•        Swain's  Panacea, 
3     "        Indian         do, 

6  dollars  worth  ofO&amp;nway's  (Boston)  Medicine,  a  large 
quantity  of  Fowler's  Solution  of  arsenic;  different  preparations 
of  Mercury,  and  other  medicines  prescribed  during  that  time  by 
my  physicians. 

After  having  exhausted  all  the  remedies  my  husband  could 
hear  of,  that  would  be  likely  to  prolong  my  wretched  life,  I  was 
reduced  to  my  bed,  where  I  lay  for  two  years  perfectly  helpless, 
and  a  greater  portion  of  the  third  year  in  the  same  situation,  an 
object  of  pity;  abandoned  by  the  doctors  as  incurable.  At  this 
period,  my  mouth,  throat,  palate  and  nose  were  greatly  ulcera- 
ted; my  palate  nearly  destroyed;  the  roof  of  my  mouth  entirely 
eaten  away;  the  wings  of  the  nose  with  the  lower  portion  all 
gone,  leaving  only  a  small  hole  instead  of  the  nostrils.  My 
head  and  face  considerably  swollen,  my  flesh  nearly  gone  from 
my  bones  with  a  fever.  In  this  situation,  I  commenced  taking 
Bristol's  Fluid  Extract  of  Sarsaparilla.  Before  I  had  used  up 
the  whole  of  one  bottle  I  got  out  of  my  bed  without  help,  and 
could  walk  about.  I  have  taken  eight  bottles  in  all,  &amp;  am  so  per- 
fectly cured  that  I  can  go  out  to  work  and  labor  through  the 
day.  My  general  health  is  good,  although  my  mouth  is  closed 
up  so  as  to  leave  but  a  small  round  hole,  which  prevents  my 
eating  except  in  very  small  quantities.  Since  I  commenced 
using  the  Sarsaparilla  my  appetite  has^  been  good,  and  I  can 
eat  any  thing  that  I  can  get  into  my  mouth.  W  hile  I  was  using 
the  Sarsaparilla,  I  paid  no  particular  attention  to  diet,  but  ate 


*"  I  am  satisfied  that  my  life  has  been  preserved  and  health  en- 
tirely restored  by  the  blessing  of  God,  and  the  use  of  Bristol's 
Fluid  Extract  of  SarsapariUa,  and  that  alone,  without  the  use 
of  any  other  medicine,  and  after  all  others  had  failed  to  effect  a 
cure.  JANE  DEMEE.

On  the  first  of  August,  1840,  came  before  me  the  above  napi- 
ed  JaneDemee,  tome  personally  known,  who  being  duly  ;aworn 
says  that  the  foregoing  statement,  made  by  her  is  just  and  true. 

IRA  CHASE, 
Justice  of  the  Peace  of  Oneida  county. 

I,  Lodowick  Demee,  residing  at  No.  20  Main  st.  in  the  city 
of  Utica,  have  read  the  foregoing  statement  made^by  my  wife 
Jane,  and  know  the  same  to  be  correct,  and  do  further  state 
that  no  other  medicine  that  she  has  taken  for  the  last  five  years, 
has  ever  done  her  any  good,  except  Bristol's  Fluid  Extract  of 
Sarsaparilla,  which  has  effected  a  miracle,  and  snatched  my 
poor  wife  (although  dreadfully  disfigured,)  from  an  early  grave.

T5oro\ig\\  &amp;i  County  of  ^Vas\\\ngton,Pa. 

Few  portions  of  our  country  are  more  happily  situated  than 
Washington  County,  Pennsylvania.  It  has  nearly  a  central 
position  in  the  United  States,  and  enjoys  gxeat  faciMties  of  com- 
munication and  general  intercourse  with  all  parts  of  the  Union. 
The  county  borders  on  the  Monongahela  river,  on  the  east,  and 
near  to  the  Ohio  on  the  west,  and  is  intersected  by  the  National 
Road,  the  great  thoroughfare  from  the  seat  of  the  National 
Government  to  the  western  states.  The  surface  is  gently  un- 
dulating. The  soil  itself  is  remarkably  fertile,  and  is  cultivat- 
ed by  a  population,  industrious  in  their  habits,  and  of  strictly 
moral  and  religious  character.  The  salubrity  of  the  climate  4 
proverbial.  The  Borough  of  Washington,  being  the  sea t^  of 
the  Courts  of  Justice,  is  the  principal  town  in  the  county.  Be- 
sides this,  there  is  the  flourishing  manufacturing  eity  of  Mon- 
ongahela, on  the  Monongahela  river — Canonsburgh,  the  seat 
of  Jefferson  College-r-West  Alexandria,  Cliysv'Ue,  Hillsbo- 
rough, West  ?.Iiddletown,  Florence,  Cross  Creek  Village, arid 
other  towns  and  villages  of  minor  note.  The  population  of  the 
eounty  of  Washington,  by  tlie  ?cnsu.^j  of  a  .340,  is  45,000.  Its

Staple  commodities  are  wool,  wheat,  com,-  flour,  horses,  hog-s, 
cattle,  sheep,  &amp;c.  In  1830  there  were  in  the  county  145,000 
sheep.  At  present  there  must  he  considerably  upwards  of 
200,000.  As  a  wool-growing  county,  Washington,  Pa.,  is  al- 
lowed to  be  second  in  the  Union  only  to  Duchess  county,  N.  Y- 
The  wool  is  of  the  best  quality  Merino  and  Saxon,  and  tlxe  an- 
nual produce  must  be  over  500,000  pounds.  There  are  about 
20  steam  mills  in  the  county  for  the  manufacture  of  floui:,  and 
also  several  woolen  manufactories. 

The  population  of  the  Borough  of  Washington,  by  the  last 
census,  is  upwards  of  2,100.  The  town  i&amp;  handsomely  situat- 
ed on  two  acclivities  rising  towards  the  north  and  east.  The 
principal  streets  are  Main,  Maiden,.  Belle,  Beaux,  and  Chestnut 
streets.  These  streets  contain  several  handsome  private  resi-. 
dences,  and  many  well  kept  stores.  The  public  buildings  are, 
the  two  college  edifices  of  Washington  Coliege,  the  Female 
Seminary,  the  Court  House,  a  new  building,  rearly  completed,, 
of  imposing  appearance,  and  having  large  and  commodious 
chambers,  and  erected  at  an  expense  of  upwards  of  $20,000; 
also  Sheriff's  House,  Market  House,  Public  Offices,  Churches, 
&amp;c.,  &amp;c. 

WASHINGTON  COLLEGE. 

The  Borough  of  Washington  is  probably  best  known  by  ite 
Literary  Institutions.  These  are  deservedly  celebrated,  and 
are  gradually  acquiring  an  extensive  and  commanding  influ- 
ence. Washington  College  was  established  in  1806.  Its 
pop\ilarity  was  such,  that  in  1835  another  new  edifice  was 
4?rected  at  a  cost  of  upwards  of  $10,000.  The  style  is  hand- 
some. The  halls  and  recitation  rooms  exceedingly  comiirto-; 
dious,  and  the  College  grounds  are  laid  out  with  taste,

Faculty,  are  always  ready  to  give  requisite  information  to  appli- 
(vants  for  admission. 

The  staged  College  Vacations  are  during  the  months  of  A- 
pril  and  October.    The  winter  session  opens  on  the  first  Men- 


flusiNESS  BiRECtroiiy  219 

-day  of  November.  The  summer  session  oji  the  first  Monday 
of  May.  Tuition,  $12  50  per  session,  always  paid  in  advance. 
CTOod  boarding  can  be  had  in  the  town  and  vicinity  at  $1  50 
to  $2  00.  In  the  new  boarding  establishment  in  the  Collegw 
buildings,  under  the  supervision  of  Mr.  Wherry,  boarding  and 
dodging  are  $1  87:  when  the  student  furnishes  his  own  lodg- 
ing, 1  50.  Some  of  the  students  board  themselves;  the  ex- 
pense is  from  50  to  62  cents  per  week,  and  $5  per  session  for 
room  rent. 

The  following  are  a  few  of  the  many  advantages  of  Wasli- 
ington  College:  Any  person  not  wishing  to  take  a  full  course 
may  become  a  student  for  the  desired  time,  in  any  one  of  the 
■classes.  Students  in  the  Englifeh  Department  have  the  privi- 
lege of  attending,  without  expense,  the  Lectures,  Recitations, 
and  Experimental  Demonstrations,  in  any  of  the  other  Depart- 
ments, as  far  as  they  come  wiihin  the  general  scope  and  objects 
of  the  English  course.  In  this  Department  are  taught  all  the 
branches  necessary  to  the  education  of  the  man  of  business, 
comprising  not  only  Grammar,  Geography,  Arithmetic,  &amp;c.,  but 
also  Natural  and  Moral  Philosophy,  Political  Economoy,  the 
htgher  branches  of  the  exact  Sciences,  Chemistry,  &amp;c.  It  is 
well  known  that  there  are  but  few  schools  throughout  the  coun- 
ty in  which  these  sciences  are  taught,  save  in  Colleges.  To 
obtain  acquaintance  with  the  branches  therefore,  without  pursu- 
ing a  regular  College  course,  and  devoting  years  to  the  dead 
languages,  is  often  exceedingly  diffiuclt,  and  subjects  the  stu- 
dent to  serious  inconvenience,  and  much  loss  of  valuable  time. 
His  course  must  be  so  controlled  by  the  arrangements  of  the 
regular  College  classes  as  to  place  him  at  one  time  behind,  and 
-at  another  too  far  in  advance  of  his  previous  acquirements.  Ke 
is  thus  either  deeply  and  unjustly  discouraged,  or  strongly 
tempted  to  habits  of  indolence.  These  evils  have  always  been 
studiously  avoided  in  the  English  Department  of  Washington 
■College.  Being  under  a  distinct  Professor,  and  other  Teach- 
ers, it  gives  the  student  all  the  advantages  of  a  College,  with- 
out, subjecting  him  to  any  of  those  drawbacks  so  well  known 
to  those  who  do  not  wish  to  undertake  a  full  Academical  course. 
Further,  Civil  Engineering,  and  the  Hebrew,  French,  and  Ger- 
man languages,  although  not  advertised  as  parts  of  the  regular 
College  Curriculum^  are  yet  taught  when  required,  and  without 
any  additional  expense.  There  are  also  t^ee  valuable  and 
well  selected  Libraries  connected  with  the  College  and  contain- 
ing about  4,000  volumes.  The  Weuihingtm,  the  Uni&amp;n  and  the 
Jackson  Literary  Societies  belonging  to  the  College  have  all  se- 
parate libraries.  These  societies  have  also  elegant  apartments 
in  the  new  College  Edifice-  The  College  Cabinet  contains  nu- 
merous specimens  of  minerals,  shells,  petrifactions,  coins,  In- 
dian, Eastern,  and  African  antiquities,  &amp;c.,  &amp;c.  There  is  a 
'"jading  room  connected   with  tlie  College,    where  the  impor 


'^'^0  HARRIS^   GENERAL      * 

tant  periodicals  of  the  day  are  to  be  obtained;  and  a  Society 
of  Inquiry  on  Missions,  where  the  Religious  and  Missiona- 
ry Journals  are  received.  By  the  terms  of  the  State  appro- 
priation which  It  enjoys,  Washing-ton  College  is  bound  to 
educate  gratis  young-  men  to  the  number  of  20  annually  who 
wish  simply  to  qualify  themselves  as  teachers. 

The  merits  of  Washington  College  rest  not  on  its  antiquity^ 
bat  on  its  efficiency.  It  is  formed  on  the  model  of  the  best  Eas- 
tern Institutions,  and  the  great  object  of  the  Faculty  and  Board 
of  Trustees  has  always  been  to  impart  a  solid,  and  an  accurate, 
not  a  hasty  and  a  superficial  education.  The  consequence  is 
that  this  Institution  is  unsurpassed  by  any  similar  Institution 
west  of  the  AUeghenies.  ^^ny  of  its  Alumni  are  at  this  mo- 
ment filling,  with  honor  to  themselves,  and  advantage  to  their 
country,  important  and  conspicuous  stations  in  the  Army,  the 
Navy,  the  National  and  State  Legislatures,  and  also  on  the 
Bench  and  at  the  Bar;  several  are  now  Presidents  and  Profes- 
sor* in  other  Colleges;  and  among  the  present  Alumni,  amount-- 
ing  to  upwards  of  VSQ  in  constant  and  regular  attendance  are 
r^tudents  from  all  partg  of  the  Union;  from  New  York,  New 
Jersey,  Vermont,  Mississippi,  Alabama,  North  Carolina,  Lour- 
s^ima,  &amp;C.1  and  from  Canada.  The  influence  of  the  College, 
and  the  number  of  educated  and  literary  persons  resident  in  the 
place,  give  a  tone  to  the  habits  and  manners  of  the  population. 
TIic  general  society  is  good,  and  the  hospitality  of  the  inhabit- 
ants proverbial.  These  advantages  together  with  the  local  situ- 
ation of  the  Borough,  the  highly  moral  and  religious  character 
of  the  population,  the  excellencies  of  the  College  itself,  and 
the  strict  attention  paid  by  the  Faculty  to  the  good  character  of 
the  students,  have  all  combined  to  make  this  College  a  favor- 
ite one  with  those  parents  and  guardians  who  are  naturally  anx- 
ious for  the  health  and  the  comfort,  as  well  as  the  education  of 
liieir  youth.  They  can  obtain  here  air  the  advantages,  without 
being  exposed  to  any  of  the  temptations,  of  large  and  densely 
oopulated  cities.- 

WASHINGTON  FEMALE  SEMINARY. 

This  institution  was  established  in  1836.  The  building  is

18US1NES6    DIRECTORY.  2&amp;1 

The  Board  of  Directors  consist  of  nine  gentlemen,  lay  and 
v?.lerical,  who  appoint  from  themselves  a  "  Visiting  Committ-ee,'' 
whose  duty  it  is  to  visit  the  Seminary  at  least  twice  every  fcur 
weeks.  The  Institution  has  a  State  appropriation  of  $50©  per 
annum.  Though  comparatively  but  lately  established,  iti^  gen- 
eral management,  and  the  abilities  of  the  teachers,  in  connex- 
ion with  tJie  known  advantages  of  the  place,  have  raised  il  to 
almost  unprecedented  prosperity.  The  present  number  of  pu- 
pils is  106.  Of  these,  fourteen  are  from  the  cit^  of  Pitts b.jrgh; 
several  from  the  various  counties  of  Pennsylvania,  and  other-s 
from  the  states  of  Virginia,  Louisiana,  Missouri,  Arkansus,  In- 
diana, &amp;c.  The  branches  taught  are  vocal  and  instrumental 
Music,  French,  Latin,  Drawing,  Painting,  Arithmetic,  Alge--

Boarding  in  the  Seminary,  $1,75,  per  week.  Fees,  Primary 
Class,  $7  per  session.  Junior  Class,  $9,50.  Senior,  $12. 
Summer  term  commences  in  May,  and  closes  on  the  last  week 
of  September.  Winter  term  commences  on  the  first  Monday 
of  November,  and  closes  on  the  last  week  of  March.  The  abil- 
ity' and  the  popularity  of  this  institution  are  such,  that  the  pres- 
ent building  has  now  become  inadequate  to  contain  the  number 
of  applicants.  The  Directors  have  resolved  to  build  a  large 
addition  to  the  present  edifice,  at  an  expense  of  about  $4,000. 
The  architect  has  been  already  engaged,  and  the  work  is  Just 
about  to  be  commenced.  It  may  be  added,  that  this  Institution 
is  conducted  on  the  principles  of  the  celebrated  Troy  Seminary, 
and  is  well  furnished  with  Library,  Globes,  and  other  necessa-

Is  situated  in  the  west  end  of  Huntingdon  county  near  the  eas» 
tern  base  of  the  Allegheny  mountains.  It  stands  on  the  eleva- 
ted tract  which  just  precedes  the  abrupt  rise  of  the  Allegheny 
ridge  proper.  It  is  amidst  a  most  abundant  iron  region,  and 
on  the  eastern  range  of  great  bituminous  coal  mines.  Ere 
long  it  will  have  a  fine  turnpike  communication  with  Bedford 
on  the  south,  and  will  connect  by  a  state  road  with  Clearfield 
on  the  north.  It  is  located  on  the  great  northern  turnpike 
leading  from  Harrisburg  to  Pittsburgh,  and  at  the  junction  of 
the  eastern  division  of  the  Pennsylvania  Canal  and  Portage 
Railroad.  To  this  junction  it  owes  much  of  its  prosperity.  It 
is  of  recent  growth.  A  few  years  ago  it  was  an  obscure  vil- 
lage (in  1830  contained  about  72  inhabitants)  but  when  the 
canal  and  rail  road  joined  there,  it  increased  in  population, 
business  and  wealth,  and  daily  improved  in  appearance.  Now 
two  boroughs,  Hollidaysburg  and  Gaysport,  immediately  join, 
and  have  the  appearance  of  one  town.  A  small  branch  of  the 
Juniata  separates  them;  they  are  the  centres  of  a  fruitful  country, 
which  will  be  well  cultivated,  and  teem  with  abundance,  both 
mineral  and  vegetable. 

Hollidaysburg,  Gaysport  and  environs  contain  upwards  of 
3000  inhabitants.

In  addition  to  the  Common  Schools,  there  are  several  pri- 
vate schools  in  successful  operation  in  all  of  which  the  several 
branches  of  an  English  education  are  taught;  also  one  classical

Above  are  the  statistics  of  Beaver  county,  for  the  year  1838, 
since  which  time  the  Canal  to  Cleveland  has  been  opened  for 
navigation;  and  in  another  season  we  may  fully  expect  a  canal 
navigation  from  our  own  harbor  to  Erie. 

The  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio  Canal  has  been  in  active  opera- 
tion since  the  commencement  of  the  season,  and  an  immense 
business  has  been  done  by  oui  forwarding  houses  at  this  place, 
,as  you  will  find  by  the  report  of  the.  ("';llector  of  Tolls,  at

Bridgewater.  When  the  Canal  to  Erie  is  completed  we  may 
reasonably  expect  a  great  increase  of  business,  as  there  will 
tlien  be  a  direct  water  communication  from  Pittsburgh  to  that 
harbor,  and  thence  to  Buffalo  and  the  towns  and  villages  along 
^.e  great  New  York  Canal. 

During  the  months  of  April,  May,  and  June,  1841,4,500 
tons  have  been  received  and  forwarded  by  our  canals. 

Besides  these  advantages  it  is  well  known  that  the  Big  Bea- 
v:r  river  affords  one  of  the  finest  water  powers  in  the  coun- 
try, v/hich.  as  yet,  is  not  improved  to  one  fourth  the  extent  of 
which  it  is  capable;  we  have  also  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of 
the  the  mouth  of  Beaver  immense  facilities  for  building  steam 
boats  and  all  other  kinds  of  boats,  and  perhaps  the  best  steem 
boat  landing  and  harbor  of  any  port  on  the  Ohio. 

All  those  advantages  and  facilities  are  located  in  a  healthy. 
rich,  and  fertile  country,  abounding  in  coal,  timber,  iron,  and 
fire-clay,  with  a  direct  water  communication,  east,  west,  north 
and  south,  for  at  least  three-fourths  of  the  year. 

A  situation  combining  so  many  natural  advantages,  only  re- 
quires to  be  known  to  be  duly  appreciated;  and  though  we 
are  from  circumstances  not  necessary  to  mention,  as  it  were, 
under  a  cloud,  yet  ere  long  the  horizon  must  clear  up,  and 
the  vicinity  of  the  mouth  of  Beaver  shine  forth  resplendant 
in  all  its  glory.  C 

"A  snt;lement  of  Germans  called  the  Harmonic  Society,  IB 
miiios  below  Pittsburgh  on  the  Ohio  river  in  Beaver  county." 
Theii  town  of  the  same  name,  containing  about  one  hundred 
brick  and  frame  dwelling  houses,  is  laid  out  at  right  angles  on 
a  beautiful  plain,  about  eighty  feet  above  low  water  mark. 
Tiieir  tract  of  land,  betv/een  three  and  four  thousand  acres, 
about  one-half  under  cultivation  is  partly  in  Allegheny  county, 
and  part  in  Beaver.  Population,  between  four  and  five  hundred, 
part  of  which  attend  to  the  cultivation  of  the  soil,  while  others 
arc  engaged  in  manufacturing. 

The"  property  is  held  in  common  as  general  and  indivisible 
slock,  and  the  models  of  their  religious  and  private  regulations, 
are  taken  from  the  precepts  of  the  first  church,  as  recorded  in 
the  Acts  of  the  Apostles.  They  say,  without  practical  exercise 
of  this  religion  in  its  strictest  sense,  they  could  not  prosper  as 
a  society. 

(ieorge  Rapp,  near  eighty-four  years  of  age,  is  in  fine  health 
and  vigor,  retaining  all  his  facultfes.  He  is  the  head  of  the 
Society,  and  has  been,  since  tha  formation  of  it  in  1805,  which 
took  place  soon  after  their  arrival  in  the  U.  States.  Their  first 
location  was  in  Butler  county.  Pa.,  but  being  desirous  of  a 
milder  climate,  they  sold  out  their  possessions,  and  settled  on

die  Wabash  river,  in  the  state  of  andiama,  where  they  mad^^ 
great  improvements,  and  after  remaining  there  ten  years,  tht  y 
resolved  unanimously  to  return  to  Pennsylvania,  \vhich  thfy 
effected  in  the  year  1824  and  25,  and  selected  their  present  lo- 
cation, which  is  said  to  be  the  best  of  the  three,  in  many  iff?- 
pects. 

Their  woolen  manufactory,  propelled  by  steam,  consumes 
annually  from  seventy  to  eighty  thousand  pounds  of  wool,  whx-h 
is  made  into  broad  cloth,  satinet,  flannel,  and  blankets  of  snpf- 
■•  rior  quality.  Their  cotton  manufactory  and  grist  mill  are  pro- 
pelled by  one  steam  engine,  the  former  consumes  about  three 
hundred  bales  of  cotton  a  year;  a  part  is  used  for  a  satinet  waip, 
a  part  is  made  into  cotton  goods,  and  the  balance  is  sold  in  the, 
yarn.  .       -, 

They  pay  great  attention  to  raising  and  manufacturing  Silk, 
using  both  the  white  Italian  and  Morus  Multicaulis  Mulberry 
with  good  success.  In  1840,  tlie  product  of  silk  was  2389  lbs. 
&lt;'.ocoous,  yielding  218  lbs.  of  reeled  silk,  which  they  manufac- 
tured into  silk  goods  of  almost  every  description. 

Having  commenced  this  business  on  a  small  scale  aboni 
twelve  years  ago,  without  any  experience  or  proper  machinery. 
and  without  any  American  model  to  take  instructions  by,  tht»y 
met  with  numerous  difficulties,  and  under  the  present  non-pro- 
tective system,  the  income  was  so  scant,  that  it  required  the  aid 
of  true  patriotic  and  economical  principles,  v.ith  an  eye  to  the 
general  good,  more  than  for  immediate  profit  and  gain,  in  Dol- 
lars and  cents,  to  overcome  the  obstacles  which  ofi^ered. 

Encouraged,  however,  for  several  years  past,  by  a  libentl 
bount}^,  paid  by  the  state  of  Pennsylvania  on  cocoons  and  reel- 
fid  silk,  they  have  spared  neither  trouble  nor  expei-^ee  to  import 
and  introduce  the  latest  and  most  accomplished  English  and 
French  machinery,  as  well  as  to  obtain  first  rate  mechanics  to 
receive  instructions  from,  to  manufacture  silk  goods  in  the  latest 
and  most  apjuoved  manner,  having  for  some  time  past  produ'- 
&lt;^ed  various  kinds  of  handkerchiefs,  plain  and  figured  dress  silk, 
plain  and  figured  satin  vestings,  floren tine,  plain  and  figured  silk 
velvet,  «S:c.  They  have  lately  erected  here,  and  kee})  now  ia 
•operation,  a  loom  of  the  latest  and  best  improved  English  plan, 
producing  sev^en  pieces  beautifull)'"  figured  Satin  Ribbon  at  one

A  small  steam  engine  has  lately  been  attached  to  the  cocoo;-- 
ery,  by  which  reels  and  other  machinery  will  be  propelled,  an  i 
a  proper  ventilation  and  temperature  in  the  cocoonery  efTectec?. 
Having  succeeded  in  finding  a  mode  by  which  tht;  Eggs  canb

serve  during  May,  Jane  and  July,  that  of  the  Morus  Multicadii 
during  August  and  September. 

After  having  had  one  of  the  best  and  ablest  silk  manufactu- 
rers of  London,  (with  family,)  i,n  their  employ  for  several  years 
they  succeeded  in  obtaining  the  services  and  information  of  an- 
other in  this  art,  a  most  distinguished  family,  immediately  on 
their  arrival  in  this  country,  by  whom  the  latest  and  best  Euro- 
pean inventions  and  improvements  in  this  interesting  branch  of 
industry,  are  thus  happily  transplanted  to  this  country.  Th6 
silk  produced  at  Economy  is  pronounced  by  the  manufacturers 
Rbove  alluded  to,  as  being  fully  equal  in  quality  to  the  best 
Piedmontese.  Upon  the  whole  the  Economy  Silk  Establish- 
ment, may  well  serve  as  a  model,  and  any  instruction  to  young 
silk  growers  is  cheerfully  given  without  charge. 

Allt'ie  product  of  th&amp;se  manufactories,  after  the  society  is 
suppii  3d,  are  deposited  in  a  warehouse  or  store,  where  sales  are' 
m  I  ie  either  by  wholesale  or  retail.

well  for  their  own  use  and  comfort,  as  also  for  the  accommoda- 
tion of  their  country  neighbors,  with  whom  a  considerable  busi- 
ness is  carried  on  in  the  purchase  and  exchange  of  country  pro- 
duce, &amp;c.  &amp;c. 

In  the  lower  story  of  a  brick  building  120  by  60  feet,  is  to  be 
found  a  large  and  extensive  museum  of  natural  curiosities,  with 
one  of  the  finest  collections  of  minerals  in  the  United  States  and 
a  large  number  of  paintings. 

The  upper  story  of  the  same  building  consists  of  one  room 
called  the  Social  Hall,  in  w^hich  the  whole  society  on  certain 
occasions  dine  altogether,  in  celebration  of  their  yearly  Harvest 
home;  the  anniversary  of  their  society,  as'  well  as  other  days  of 
importance  to  them. 

Th«y  have  also  erected  a  large  brick  church,  finished  in  a 
neat  but  plain  manner.  They  meet  twice  on  Sunday  and  once 
on  an  evening  during  the  week.  Visitors  all  agree  that  ryj 
where  so  much  good  order,  silence  and  attention  can  be  found 
during  service  as  among  these  people.,  Mr.  Rapp  delivers  the 
discourse  in  the  German  language,  which  is  generally  sp-oken 
amonfir  them,  although  many  of  the  members  are  vveil  acquaint- 
ed with  the  Englishlanguage.  The  tower  or  steeple  m  furnish- 
ed with  two  bells,  and  a  town  clock  which  strikes  each  quarter 
of  an  hour,  the  latter  is  said  to  be  of  their  own  make. 

They  have  a  large  and  commodious  school  house  for  the  edu- 
cation of  their  children. 

A  fine  and  numerous  band  of  music  occasionally  entertain 
the  society  with  a  concert. 

They  have  a  physician  of  their  own,  and  an  apothecary  shop. 

A  large  and  well  arranged  Hotel  for  the  accommodation  o*f 
travellers  is  keptby  the  society,  as  \vell  as  a  post  oflUce.

of  good  stock,  and  regularly  taken  care  of,  and  stabled  in  "win- 
ter, are  the  best  we  have  seen  in  the  western  coittitry. 

In  agriculture  they  are  not  surpassed  by  any,  their  fieids, 
meadows,  orchards,  vineyards,  museries  of  mulberry  and  frwit 
trees,  are  the  best  the  country  afibrds,  and  many  travellers  from 
all  parts  take  pleasure  in  stopping  to  see  this  interesting  place. 

Some  peculiarities  in  their  internal  arrangments,  seem  to  us 
strange  and  singular,  but  having  chosen  the  United  States  for 
their  residence,  and  complying  with  all  civil  duties  required  by 
law,  no  one  will  pretend  to  question  their  free  and  undeniable 
jprivilege  to  select  such  a  inode  of  living  as  in  their  opinion  will 
oest  promote  happiness  here  and  hereafter. 

Each  department  or  branch  of  business  is  headed  by  a  fore- 
man, who  is  responsible  to  uphold  the  standing  rules  and  regu- 
lations, and  to  dojustice  to,  and  act  impartially  to  all  members, 
in  the  distribution  of  all  the  necessaries  of  life. 

Their  habits  of  industry,  morality  and  strict  adherence  to 
sound  religious  principles,  leading  to  unanimity  and  peace, 
speak  volumes  in  their  favor.  They  clearly  demonstrate  to  the 
world,  how  much  vice  and  misery  can  be  eradicated  in  the  hu- 
man family,  and  what,  degree  of  human  happiness  may  be  at- 
tained, by  combined  action  of  heart  and  hand. 

We  say,  it  cannot  be  a  bad  tree  that  bears  good  fruit.

Is  situated  on  the  west  bank  of  Big  Beaver  river,  at  the  base  of 
a  precipice  or  hill  from  five  to  six  hundred  feet  in  height,  and 
three  miles  in  length,  abounding  incoalj  alum  and  other  miner- 
als. Its  location,  situated  as  it  is,  with  its  numerous  munufac- 
tories  of  various  kinds,  between  water  and  coal,  and  immediate- 
ly opposite  New  Brighton,  we  think  is  one  of  the  best  in  the 
world  for  various  manufactures.  Its  water  power  is  immense, 
situated  immediately  on  or  at  the  foot  of  the  falls,  from  which  the 
town  assumes  its  name.  Both  steam  and  water  power  is  em- 
ployed; a  race  is  permanently  constructed  a  mile  and  a  half  in 
in  length  which  conducts  the  water,  upon  Vv^hich  a  solid  row  of 
manufactaring  establishments  is  erected  and  in  full  operation. 
This  borough  contains  from  ten  to  twelve  hundred  inhabitants, 
who  are  a  very  industrious  and  useful  people,  prosperous  and 
flourishing.  A  permanent  bridge  connects  it  with  New  Brigh- 
ton, on  which  shore  is  a  canal  and  slack  water  navigation  from 
the  Ohio  river  to  Cleveland  and  Lake  Erie,  on  which  canal

Brig\vton, 


Situated  on  the  west  side  of  the  Big  Beaver  river,  in  Beaver 
county,  four  miles  from  the  Ohio,  is  a  very  beautiful  and  flour- 
ishing place,  commanding  an  everlasting  water  power,  capabl* 
of  driving  any  quanty  of  machinery. 

"^rhere  is  now  in  successful  operation  1  flouring  mill  and  on» 
cotton  mill,   owned  by  Mr.  Jas.   Patterson.     The  flouring  mill 
^6  capable  of  turning  out  200  bble.  of  flour  per  day,  of  very 
21 


•J42  HARRIS*    GENERAL. 

snperioT  quality,  and  is  pronounced  by  fir?!  rate  judges  in  Phi- 
ladelphia, (to  which  place  Mr,  Patterson  principally  ships  his 
flour)  to  be  equal  to  the  best  Genessee  Brand.  3  boats  are 
kept  in  constant  motion  during  the  navigable  season  to  supply 
it  with  wheat.  6  men  are  engaged  in  the  mill,  and  the  shops 
connected  with  it  give  constant  employment  to  16  coopers.— 
The  enterprising  owner  has  recently  constructed  a  canal  leading 
to  his  mills  and  machinery  for  unloading  wheat  from  boats  which 
is  nearly  completed.  It  is  really  pleasing  to  see  one  of  Messrs. 
fl.  &amp;  P.  Graff's  pretty  portable  boats  gliding  along  the  canal 
with  a  load  of  flour,  and  to  think  of  the  short  time  that  has 
passed  away  since  the  poor  Indian  trod  upon  the  earth  that  has 
bc-en  excavated. 

The  cotton  mill  gives  employment  to  35  hands,  and  manufac- 
tures  about  3,000  lbs.  of  yarn  per  week;  a  store  is  connected 
.with  these  establishments, 

There  is  also  one  steam  paper  mill,  owned  by  Mr.  A.  Robert- 
son, with  four  engines;  and  a  staining  establishment  is  connect- 
ed with  it,  giving  employment  to  ten  families.  The  water  used 
m  this  establishment  is  forced  some  500  feet,  by  the  application 
of  a  pump,  which  works  by  water,  and  is  free  from  expense 
and  trouble;  too  much  praise  cannot  be  bestowed  on  the  enter- 
prising owner;  and  he  richly  deserves  the  reputation  he  now 
enjoys. 

There  is  also  a  tannery  and  several  mechanical  establish- 
ments. Also  a  very  neat  and  commodious  meeeting  house  and 
school  room.     Population  300.

lis  procured  with  but  little  labor,  some  veins  being  from  4  to  6 
feet  thick. 

.Fire  Clay  is  also-found  in  abundance. 


BUSINESS   DtRECTORV  240 

Considerable  quantity  of  good  Quartz  is  found  near  at  hand 
and  taken  in  connection  with  the  abundance  of  coal,  it  would 
fully  justify  the  investment  of  capital  for  the  manufacture  of 
Glass, 

The  water  power  is  sufficient,  if  put  into  use,  to  make  this  a 
large  manufacturing  town,  there  is  a  permanent  dam  across  the 
Nashanock  and  Shenango,  10  feet  high,  built  by  the  state,  con- 
necting them  by  canal  and  guard  lock.  Since  our  last,  therq 
has  been  two  Churches  erected,  which  shows  that  the  inhabit- 
ants are  working  for  their  spiritual  as  well  as  their  worldly 
good,  fully  aware  that  without  the  former,  the  blessings  of  the 
lattet  would  be  unenjoyed. 

Amount  of  surplus  Produce  shipped  from  New  Castle,  Pa.^  from

Is  situated  in  the  North  Western  part  of  Mercer  county,  Pa.  -^ 
This  village  is  pleasantly  located  on  the  Shenango  river,  and 
is  surrounded  by  the  finest  and  most  beautiful  bodies  of  land 
in  western  Pennsylvania.  The  Erie  extension  canal  passes 
through  the  town,  affording  every  facility  of  commerce.  There 
are  in  the  immediate  vicinity,  extensive  mines  of  coal  of  a  su- 
perior quality,  large  quantities  of  which  are  exported  to  Nevr 
York  and  the  Lakes.  There  are  also  inexhaustible  beds  of  iron 
oy&lt;*  in  the  neighborhood.

The  rapid  growth  of  the  town,  and  the  taste  and  beauty  ex- 
hibited in  its  improvements,  are  strong  indications  of  the  supe- 
rior advantages  of  its  location.  Five  years  ago  it  contained  not 
more  than  three  hundred  inhabitaiits;  it  now  comprises  a  popu- 
lation of  near  one  thousand.  The  Srhenango  river  affords  very 
extensive  water  ^ower.  There  are  now  in  successful  opera- 
tion two  flouring  mills,  one  saw  mill,  one  fulling  mill,  1  car- 
ding machine,  one  furniture  factory,  all  owned  by  Messrs.  Mc- 
Dowell, Mathers  and  Sill.  An  extensive  foundry,  owned  by 
G.Bond.  Thereisinthe  immediate  neighborhood,  a  valuable 
oil  mill.  There  is  still  a  large  supply  of  water  power,  well 
worthy  the  attention  of  the  capitalist  and  manufacturer.

sons residing  at  Eltzabetli  will  be  able  visit  to  Pittsburgh  by  this 
pleasant  and  expeditious  route,  in  two  hours  of  the  morning, 
;ind  return  on  the  same  evening,  allowing  them  more  than  half 
the  day  to  attend  to  business  in  the  city^  It  will  also  afford 
manufactories  a  tine  field  for  operation.'  Lots,  lumber,  lands 
and  materials  being  held  very  low,  and  the  place  now  so  easy 
of  access,  it  affords  the  strongest  inducements  to  men,  either  of 
large  or  small  means,  t^  invest.  Coal  in  the  pits  per  bushel 
can  be  purchased,  for  half  a  cent,  and  delivered  in  the  village  at 
three  cents  per  bushel.  Lime  and  free  stone  of  the  best  quality 
are  cheap  and  convenient.  Lumber  froin  the  upper  country  on 
the  river  descends  to  this  point  on  large  rafts  and  is  afforded  at 
fair  prices.  Steam  boats  of  the  largest  as  well  as  some  of  the 
smallest  class  are  built  here  to  as  great  an  extent  as  any  place 
on  the  western  waters;  many  of  those  boats  do  credit  to  the  build- 
ers and  place,  as  well  as  to  the  city  of  Pittsburgh,  where  they 
•arc  generally  furnished  and  finished,  and  put  in  commission. 
There  are  three  steam  boats  now  on  the  stocks  of  Elizabeth-

BUSINKJ-s    i.\  RECTORY  ^^•' 

Jo^mestowu,  New   Yotk. 

The  village  of  Jamestown  is  situated  on  the  outlet  of  Chatau- 
'que  Lake,  7  miles  north  of  ilu.  i^ennsylvania  line,  twenty-one 
miles  S.  E  of  Mayvillc,  and  !2i)  miles  from  the  port  of  Barcelo- 
na, on  Lake  Brie,  30  miles  8  r.i  Dunkirk,  21  miles  from  War- 
renPa.,  and  150  miles  from  Pi;  burgh. 

This  village  is  the  most  pc'p&gt;;l.  us  in  the  county,  and  was  in- 
corporated in  182G,  and  is  govei  wed  by  a  President  and  Board 
©f  Trustees,  elected  annually,  and  contains  a  population  of  about 
1500.  Perhaps  no  place  in  the  Tnited  States  is  healthier  or 
less  subject  to  epidemics.  The  outlet  of  the  Lake,  within  the 
bounds  of  the  village,  furnishes  ?■  good  extent  of  water  power 
for  manufacturing  purposes,  and  within  about  three  miles  has  a 
fall  of  over  75  feet,  and  from  the  durability  of  the  stream,  its 
contiguity  to  the  great  reservoir  which  the  Lake  affords;  its 
gradual  rise  and  fall,  no  damage  is  ever  experienced  from  floods, 
nor  is  the  machinery  ever  olistructed  by  ice,  as  the  river  remains 
open  in  the  winter.  Much  of  the  water  power  has,  until  recent- 
ly been  employed  in  manufacturing  lumber  which  has  been 
tafted  down  the  stream  to  the  Ohio  and  Mississippi  rivers,  but 
^rom  the^becoming  scarcity  of  pine  lumber  and  the  rapidjimprove- 
•ment  of  the  village  and  the  surrounding  country  in  buildings, 
nearly  all  the  lumber  made  is  required  for  h'^rne  consumption. 
The  village  and  the  surrounding  country  and  indeed  nearly  the 
whole  county,  was  mostly  an  entire  wilderness  until  the  ter- 
mination of  the  war  in  1815,  since  which,  they  have  ha3  a 
steady  and  gradual  growth  corresponding  with  the  surrounding 
country,  unaccompanied  with  that  mania  of  speculation  and  con- 
sequent ruin  that  has  visited  some  other  places.  Tlie  county 
now  contains  a  populution  of  48,000  and  is  rapidly  improving. 
This  village  was  laid  out  by  Judges  Prendergrast  and  Foote, 
the  latter  is  still  a  resident!  Freight  is  transported  between 
New  York  and  Jamestown  by  canal  and  steam  boat  navigation, 
except  a  portage  of  8  miles  between  the  port  of  Barcelona  on 
Lake  Erie,  (GO  miles  above  Buffalo,)  and  Mayville  the  head  of 
'Chatauque  Lake;  this  is  the  shortest  portage  between  Lake 
Erie  and  the  navigable  waters  of  the  great  valley  of  the  Missis- 
sippi. The  remains  of  an  ancient  French  portage  road  between 
these  points,  is  in  many  places  plainly  to  be  traced,  though 
large  trees  have  grown  up  on  the  road,  and  at  the  harbor  of 
Barcelona  are  the  remains  of  an  ancient  wharf  under  water. 
There  is  a  daily  Steam  Boat  on  Lake  Chatauque,  from  James- 
town to  Mayville,  (21  miles)  and  back  daily.  This  Lake  is 
more  than  200  feet  above  Lake  Erie,  and  more  than  1100  above 
tide  water,  and  perhaps  the  highest  body  of  water  upon  which  a 
^team  boat  floats.  In  the  village  there  are  4  religious  societies, 
Presbyterian,  Methodist,  Congregational  and  Baptist,  each  hav- 
ing  well  finished  and  pleasant  houses  of  worship   and   setth^l

and  but  two  taverns  and  a  drug-ocist  that  deals  in  the  article,  and

DEXTERVILLE, 

One  and  a  fourth  miles  E.  of  Jamestown,  on  the  N.  shore  of  the 
outletof  Chautiuque  Lake.  At  this  place  is  one  of  the  best 
h3'draulic  powers  in  the  western  country  and  will  no  doubt,  ere 
iong,  become  like  its  neighbor,  Jamestown,  a  place  of  much 
business  and  extensive  in  manufactures.  At  this  place  there  is 
annually  manufictuved  about  two  millions  feet  of  pine  boards, 
besides  large  quantities  of  lath  and  shingles.  However  the 
pinetimbffris  rapidly  disappearing,  and  the  water  power  will 
soon  cease  to  be  used  for  manufacturing  lumber.  At  this  place 
:s  the  celebrated  axe  and  edge  tool  manufactory  of  Barns  an&lt;l 
Edgerton.  John  R.  Cowing,  Esq.,  is  the  principal  proprietor  of 
this  village.     Patrie  Falconer,  attorney. 

LEVANT, 

A  new  village  and  Post  Office,  situated  at  the  conlluence  of  the 
outlets  of  Chautauque  and  Cosadauqua  lakes,  four  miles  East 
of  Jamestown  on  the  eastern  stage  rout  from  Jamestown,  EUi- 
otiville  and  Canandaigua.  This  village  was  laid  out  by  Wood- 
ley  W.  Chandler  and  John  W.  Winsor,  Esqs.,  and  bids  fair  to 
becomie  a  fine  town.  Samuel  B.  Winsor,  Esq.  Justice  of  the

i'his  is  the  seat  of  justice  for  Brooke  County,  Va.,  sitaate«l 
on  an  elevated  and  extensive  bottom  on  the  Ohio  river,  16  m\]t'n 
above  Wheeling,  and  44  miles  by  land  below  Pittsburgli.  It 
is  surrounded  by  one  of  the  most  productive  countries  in  th*- 
western  country,  having  for  its  inhabitants,  an  industrious  anil 
enterprising  people,  who  annually  produce  and  furnish  large 
quantities  of  grain,  flour,  horses,  cattle,  sheep,  wool,  beef,  pork.- 
butter,  and  a  variety  of  other  articles  common  to  this  latitudt.

neighborhood  am^nof  which  are  R.  Waugh's,  3  miles  frorri 
town,  on  Buffalo  creek,  manufacturing  about  10,000  barrels  of 
flour  annually  for  exportation.  This  town  has  had  for  many 
years  the  reputation  of  furnishing  more  flour,  and  that  of  a  bet- 
ter quality  than  any  town  on  the  Ohio  river — the  principle  mar- 
ket for  which  has  been  New  Orleans,  though,  of  late  years, 
much  of  it  has  been  sent  via  Pittsburgh  to  Philadelphia.  Many 
of  the  citizens  are  engaged  in  purchasing  and  exporting  this 
article.  Its  advantages  for  roads  are  not  surpassed,  they  lead- 
ing to  and  from  it  in  all  directions.  East  is  the  Wellsburg  and 
Washington  turnpike  intersecting  the  great  National  Road  at 
"Washington,  Pa.;  west  a  graded  road  intersecting  the  national 
road  at  Cambridge,  forming  a  route  from  Baltimore  to  Colum- 
bus ten  miles  shorter  than  any  other  used,  and  passing  through  a 
country  that  for  beauty  and  fertility  cannot  be  surpassed.  The 
road  from  Wheeling  to  Pittsburgh  passes  through  the  town,  in- 
tersecting the  Steubenville  and  Pittsburgh  turnpike,  at  Holli- 
days  (yove.  The  town  has  been  engaged  for  some  years,  and 
is  still  engaged,  in  erecting  wharves,  the  walls  of  which  are 
of  stone,  and  of  great  weight.  When  these  are  finished  there 
will  be  no  town  on  the  river  surpassed  in  its  convenient  land- 
inos  and  safe  harbors  from  ice.  There  is  now  being  erected  at 
Bethany,  only  7  miles  from  Wellsburg  and  in  the  same  county, 
one  of  the  most  extensive  colleges  in  the  United  States.  It  will- 
go  into  operation  in  November  next,  under  the  superintendance 
of  Alexander  Campbell,  and  is  calculated  for  the  accommoda- 
tion of  500  students.  The  buildings  erected,  and  those  erect- 
ing, are  of  the  most  permanent  kind  being  built  of  brick  upon 
stone  foundations,  and  are  expressly  adopted  to  the  health  and 
cemfort  of  the  occupants.  The  situation  is  one  of  great  beau- 
ty. Wellsburg  will  necessarily  derive  much  benefit  from  its- 
neighborhood  to  this  institution  as  it  will  be  the  point  at  which, 
those  visiting  it  will  arrive  and  depart  from. 

The  town  embraces  a  large  area  of  ground,  and  contains  up- 
wards of  2000  inhabitants.  The  buildings  are  generally  of 
brick,  well  and  substantially  constructed,  and  latterly  theKe 
have  been  many  erected  as  dwellings,  which  display  a  consid- 
erable degree  of  taste.  Its  location  is  generally  con- 
ceded to  be  one  of  the  most  healthy  and  pleasant  on  the  Ohio 
river,  and  is  surrounded  with  all  the  advantages  of  water,  fer- 
tility and  health.  Its  inhabitants  are  an  intelligent  and  enter- 
prising people;  it  is  gradually  increasing  in  population  and  per- 
manent buildings,  and  no  doubt  will  eventually  be  a  place  of 
some  considerable  importance,  as  there  are  in  its  immediate 
vicinity,  many  inexhaustible  beds  of  stone  coal,  a  great  number 
of  the  most  desirable  and  advantageous  situations  for  man- 
ufacturing establishments,  and  much  unoccupied  water  power 
which  mfght  bo  used  with  profit.  The  public  buildings  are  a

Warren,  0\\\o. 

This  flourishing  town,  the  county  seat  of  Trumbull  county, 
is  situated  on  the  Mahoning  river,  a  branch  of  the  Big  Beaver, 
n»ar  the  centre  of  the  county,  and  is  easy  of  access  both  from 
the  east  and  west  by  means  of  the  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio  ca- 
nal which  passes  through  it.  The  principal  part  of  the  town 
is  laid  out  around  a  large  public  square,  in  the  centre  of  which 
is  the  Court  House,  and  around  or  near  it  are  the  county  oflices. 
There  are  many  delightful  private  residences  here,  the  grounds 
around  which  are  very  elegantly  and  tastefully  laid  out,  and 
planted  with  trees  and  ornamental  shrubbery,  like  those  family 
mansions  which  are  more  frequently  met  with  in  the  eastern  and 
longer  settled  portions  of  our  country  than  in  the  west. 
As  might  be  expected  from  this  evidence  of  refinement,  the  so- 
ciety is  very  good  and  intelligent,  and  this  with  the  accommo- 
dations of  several  first  rate  hotels,  make  Warren  a  very  plea- 
sant place  to  pass  a  few  months,  particularly  in  the  summer. 
The  inhabitants  are  very  industrious,  wealthy,  and  good-livers, 
presenting  a  fair  sample  of  the  best  New  England  manners.

This  flourishing  town  is  situated  in  the  centre  of  a  rich  and' 
fertile  county,  and  pjobably  no  one  town  on  the  Reserve  deals 
as  largely  in  agricultural  products.  Some  of  the  farmers  are 
Tery  wealthy.  It  has  a  population  of  between  fifteen  hundred 
and  two  thousand. 

The  water  power  of  the  vicinity  is  very  good,  being  situated 
on  the  Mahoning,  and  is  the  producer  of  much  wealth  to  the 
inhabitants.  The  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio  Cross  Cut  canal  pass- 
es through  it,  affording  facilities  for  comjnanication  with  all  the 
principal  towns  in  Ohio  and  Pennsylvania.  It  will  probably 
be  one  of  the  most  important  places  in  the  Western  Reserve, 
both  as  respects  agriculture  and  manufacturing  interests.

Akron,  OWio, 

Is  located  upon  the  Ohio  Canal,  at  the  junction  of  the  Penn- 
sylvania &amp;  Ohio  Canal  and  the  Ohio  Canal,  38  miles  south  of 
Cleveland,  and  116  miles  west  of  Pittsburgh.  The  commer- 
cial prosperity  and  facilities  of  Akron,  are  equal,  if  not  superior, 
to  any  other  interior  town  in  the  State,  having  a  location  at  the 
western  termination  of  the  P.  &amp;  O.  Canal,  and  at  its  junction 
with  the  Ohio  Canal.  Akron  holds  the  key  to  its  commerce, 
and  through  it  is  connected  the  western  commerce  of  Philadel- 
phia and  New  York,  by  way  of  the  Pennsylvania  rail  roa5s 
and  canals.  Its  peculiar  location  upon  the  Ohio  canal,  with  a 
jeference  to  the  21Jiocks,  where  it  is  situated,  together  with  its 
manufacturing  power,  makes  Akron  the  depot  of  an  extensive 
cultivated  and  fertile  region  of  country  west  and  south  of  it, 
which  country  depends  exclusively  upon  it  for  her  market  and 
manufactures.  The  improved  and  unimproved  hydraulic  power 
concentrated  at  Akron,  is  confessedly  superior  in  extent  and 
permanency  to  any  other  water  power  in  the  State  by  the  im- 
provements already  completed.  It  controls  the  entire  water  of 
the  southern  branch  of  the  Cuyahoga  river,  over  a  fall  of  about 
one  hundred  and  eighty  feet,  and  by  means  of  the  P.  &amp;  O.  ca- 
nal, and  the  improvements  of  the  Portage  Canal  and  Manufac- 
t-uring  Co.,  now  in  process  of  completion,  will  ultimately  se- 
cure about  the  same  amount  of  fall  of  the  water  of  the  western 
branch  of  the  Cuyahoga.  These  immense  resources  of  water 
power  are  rendered  accessible  and  convenient  to  the  business 
precincts  of  Akron.  A  portion  of  this  water  power  is  now  em- 
ployed in  Akron,  in  running  the  machinery  of  four  flouring 
mills,  having  in  the  aggregate  seventeen  run  of  stones,  and  ma- 
nufacturing in  the  season  about  sixty  thousand  barrels  of  flour. 
3  cupala  and  1  black  furnace,  4  woollen  factories,  2  machine 
shops,  1  pail  factory,  1  chair  factory,  and  a  variety  of  other  ma- 
chinery. 

The  present  population  of  Akron  is  upwards  of  two  thou- 
sand, a  population  acquired  principally  within  six  years,  and 
now  rapidly  increasing,  Akron,  as  a  town,  is  located  on  a 
high  and  healthy  position,  and  furnished  abundantly  with  pur-e 
spring  water.  The  enterjjrise,  industry,  and  prosperity,  is  in- 
dicated by  the  extent  and  rapidity  of  its  growth  and  its 
business  success.  Akron  has  12  dry  goods,  drug,  and  book 
stores,  6  taverns,  and  manufacturing,  mechanical,  and  trading 
business  in  proportion. 

The  moral  intelligence  and  religious  character  of  the  inhab- 
itants has  procured  within  the  last  live  years  the  erection  of  five 
edifices  of  religious  worship:  1  Presbyterian,  1  Baptist,  1  Epis- 
eopal,  1  Methodist  PJpiscopal,  1  Universalist.

which  we  have  received  from  our  early  friend,  the  author,  and 
read  over  with  pleasure  and  profit,  and  derived  much  instruc-

of  forty  years;  and  we  love  to  tell  of  her  industry,  progress,

Cincinnati,  the  largest  city  of  the  west,  is  situated  in  a  gradu- 
al bend  of  the  Ohio  river,  on  its  northern  bank,  and  immediat«- 
l)"-  opposite  Newport  and  Covington,  Kentucky.  Its  latitude 
was  determined  by  colonel  Jared  Mansfield  in  his  topographi- 
cal surveys,  39  deg.  6  min.  30  sec.  north,  and  its  longitude  7 
deg.  24  min.  45  sec.  west.  It  is  nearly  central  between  Pitts- 
burgh at  the  head  of  the  Ohio,  and  Cairo  at  the  junction  of  that 
river  with  the  Mississippi,  being  about  465  miles  from  each 
point.  Its  distance  by  land  traveling  is — ^from  Columbus  1 15; 
Indianapolis  120;  Lexington  90;  Nashville  270;  and  Pittsburgh 
298,  miles.  By  steamboat  conveyance — from  Louisville  138, 
St.  Louis  655,  Natchez  1335,  and  New  Orleans  1631.  By 
stage  route  it  is  502  miles  from  Washington,  518  from  Balti- 
more, 617  from  Philadelphia,  and,  via  Lake  Erie  and  the  Erie 
canal,  650  miles  from  New  York. 

The  upper  plane  of  Cincinnati  is  540  feet  above  tide  water 
at  Albany,  and  25  feet  below  the  level  of  Lake  Erie:  low  water 
mark  of  the  Ohio  river  here  being  432  feet  above  tide  water  at 
Albany,  or  133  feet  below  Lake  Erie.     The  descent  of  the  up-

per  part  of  Cincinnati  to  low  water  mark  is  therefore  108  feet; 
The  city  is  almost  in  the  eastern  extremity  of  a  valley  of  about 
twelve  miles  in  circumference,  perhaps  the  most  delightful  and 
extensive  on  the  borders  of  the  Ohio.  The  platform  of  the 
city  is  composed  of  two  parts,  the  second  table  rising  consider- 
ably above  the  level  of  the  first,  affording,  under  a  regular  sys- 
tem of  city  grading,  that  desirable  medium  of  slope  which  per- 
mits the  drainage  to  pass  off  freely,  while  it  affords  from  the 
city  landing  an  easy  ascent. 

The  hills  which  surround  this  extensive  valley,  present  to  the 
eye  of  the  beholder  one  continued  ridge,  irregularly  elevated, 
and  of  diversified  configurations.  They  exhibit,  under  no  cir- 
cumstances, an  aspect  of  grandeur;  but  are  always  beautiful  and 
picturesque.  Their  average  elevation  above  the  plain,  is  about 
three  hundred  feet;  and,  instead  of  the  bold  and  rocky  declivi- 
ties, which  characterize  the  freestone  regions  of  the  Ohio,  they 
present  gentle  and  varying  slopes,  which  are  mostly  covered 
with  native  forest  trees.  The  aspect  of  the  valley  from  the  sur- 
rounding hills  is  highly  beautiful.  It  is  various  in  its  charac- 
ter, as  it  is  seen  at  different  seasons,  and  from  different  points. 
In  approaching  Cincinnati  by  water,  whether  ascending  or  de- 
scending the  tiver,  the  view  is  neither  extensive  nor  com- 
manding." 

BOUNDARIES  AND  DIVISIONS. 

"Cincinnati  is  bounded — north  by  Fulton  and  Mill  creek 
townships;  the  Ohio  river  forms  its  southern  and  eastern  boun- 
daries; and  Mill  creek  lies  on  its  west.  It  is  divided  into  seven 
wards,  whose  boundary  lines  are  as  follows: 

1st  Ward,  includes  that  part  of  the  city  which  is  between 
Main  street  and  the  corporation  line,  on  the  north  and  west,  and 
the  third  ward  on  the  south  and  east.  The  line  between  the 
first  and  third  wards  is — from  Main  street,  east  on  Fourth  to 
Pike  street,  thence  to  Symmes  or  High  street,  to  the  reservoir 
of  the  city  water  works,  thence  north  1 6  degrees  east  to  the  line 
o{  Fulton  township. 

2d  Ward  comprehends  all  between  Main  street  and  Western 
row,  and  Sixth  street  on  the  north  and  the  fourth  ward  on  the 
south.  The  boundary  line  between  the  second  and  fourth  ward 
is — from  Main  along  Fourth  to  Walnut  street,  thence  on  Wal- 
nut to  Baker  street,  thence  along  Burnet  street,  Wright's  alley, 
McFarland  and  Ruffner  streets  to  Western  row. 

3d  Ward,  from  Main  street  to  the  Fulton  township  line,  and 
from  the  division  line  with  the  first  ward,  to  the  river  Ohio. 

4th  Ward,  from  Main  street  to  Western  row,  and  its  division 
line  with  the  second  ward,  to  the  Ohio. 

5th  Ward,  extends  from  Main  to  Plum  street,  and  from  Sixth 
street  to  the  corporation  line. 


274 

6th  Ward  embraces  that  part  of  the  city  from  Sixth  street  to 
the  river,  and  from  Western  row  to  Mill  creek. 

7th  Ward  includes  the  space  from  Sixth  street  north,  and 
Plum  street  west,  to  the  corporation  lines." 

CLIMATE. 

"The  climate  of  Cincinnati  and  vicinity,  is  such  as  rnightbe&gt; 
expected  in  its   appro|3riate  latitude.     It  differs  from  the  same', 
parallel  at  the  Atlantic,  only  in  being  rather  more  variable  in' 
the  range  of  the  thermometer,  and  the  greater  frequency  of  rain  , 
in  the  winter  months.     Indeed,  a  fall  of  many  degrees  in  Uie.^, 
thermometer,  in  the  course  of  but  a  few  hours,  is  not  uncoiri- 
mon  in  this  city,  at  any  period  of  the  year.     The  cold  weather  . 
in  winter  is  of  intensity  equal  to  that  at  the  east,  and  perhaps  r, 
the  north,  but  severe  frosts  are  less  freqUiBnt  in  their  occurrence, 
and  of  briefer  existence.     Snow  rarely  lies  long  enough  to  fur- 
nish sleighing,  and  the  constant  alternation  of  the  freezing  and 
thawing  renders  the  traveling  through  unpaved  streets,  in  the 
winter  season,  very  unpleasant."

REMARKS. 

From  Pittsburgh  to  Cincinnati,  both  shores  of  tlie  Ohio 
amount  to  more  tlian  nine  linndred  miles.  From  Cincinnati  to 
New  Orleans,  there  is  a  river  coast  of  the  Ohio  and  Mississippi 
of  more  tiian  three  thousand  miles.  The  Upper  Mississippi, 
from  the  moiith  of  the  Ohio  to  the  Falls  of  St.  Anthony,  has 
one  thousand  six  hundred  miles  of  fertile  shore.  The  shoresr 
of  that  part  of  the  Missouri  which  has  been  navigated  by  steam, 
amount  to  four  thousand  miles.  One  of  the  numerous  tribu- 
taries of  the  Missouri,  the  Yellow  Stone,  is  represented  to  be 
as  large,  and  to  afford  an  extensive  navigation  as  the  Oliio. 
The  Arkansas  and  Red  rivers,  toorether,  have  not  less  extent  of 


BUSINESS   DIRECTORY.  283 

Bteamboatable  waters  than  the  Missouri.  The  shores  of  lli« 
Illinois,  Wabash,  Tennessee,  Cumberland,  St.  Francis,  White, 
Wachitta,  and  Des  Moines  rivers^  as  far  only  as  those  streams 
can  be  navigable  by  larg^e  steamboats,  amount  to  nljout  four 
thousand  miles.  Althouoh  tiie  above  enumeration  leaves  »juta 
great  many  streams  on  which  large  steam  vessels  will,  at  some 
firtare  day,  ply  for  thousands  of  miles,  it  is  believed  that 
enough  has  been  brought  into  this  estimate  for  my  purpose. 
Here,  then,  are  fertile  shores  falling  little  short  of  twenty  thou- 
sand miles,  which  can  easily  be  visited  by  large  steam  vessels 
the  greater  part  of  the  year.  According  to  Mr  Flint,  the  boatar 
ble  waters  of  the  Ohio  and  its  tributaries  alone,  amount  to  five 
thousand  miles;  and  those  of  the  Mississippi,  including  all  its 
tributaries  and  bayous,  are  estimated  by  the  same  author  at 
forty  thousand  miles.  Taking  all  these  streams  together,  they 
probably  afford  facilities  for  trade  nearly  equal  in  value  to  the 
same  number  of  miles  of  common  canals. 

What  reasonable  man,  then,  having  informed  himself  on  the 
subject,  can  doubt  that,  in  the  midst  of  these  wonderful  facili- 
ties for  trade,  with  such  a  soil,  and  peopled  and  peopling  by  tht&gt; 
most  active  and  enterprising,  and,  in  some  respects,  intelligent 
population  on  the  globe,  prodigious  cities  must  here  grow  up, 
and  with  a  rapidity  having  no  example  on  the  Atlantic  coast. 
You  will  look,  in  vain,  on  that  border  for  towns  exhibiting  such 
rapid  advances  in  wealth  and  population  as  Cincinnati,  Pitts- 
burgh, and  Louisville  have  ex})erience(l  since  1825.  And  who 
can  doubt  that  they  will  continue  to  advance  in  a  rapidly  in- 
creasing ratio,  unless  Providence,  b}''  some  unforeseen  event, 
should  stop  the  tide  of  immigration,  and  dry  up  the  prolific  sour 
ces  of  increase  at  home,  which,  in  their  wonderful  fecundit}', 
seems  to  insure  us,  at  no  distant  day,  a  multitudinous  popula- 
tion, independent  of  foreign  supply. 

But  our  interior  cities  do  not  depend  for  their  developement 
altogether  on  the  domestic  trade;  they  can  partake,  with  their 
Atlantic  sisters,  of  the  foreign,  also;  and  if,  as  some  suppose, 
the  profits  of  commerce  increase  with  the  distance  at  which  it  is 
carried  on,  and  the.  difficulties  which  nature  has  thrown  in  its 
way,  the  western  marts  will  have  the  same  advantage  over  their 
eastern  rivals  in  foreign  commerce,  which  some  claim  for  the 
latter  over  the  former  in  our  domestic  trade.  Cincinnati  may 
use  the  outports  of  New  Orleans  and  New  York,  as  Paris  and 
Vienna^  use  those  of  Havre  and  Trieste;  and  it  may  come  to 
pass,  that  steamships  from  Europe  will  enter  our  great  lakes, 
and  be  seen  booming  up  the  Mississippi.

CITY  OF  CLEVELAND. 

Cleveland  is  the  emporium  of  Northern  Ohio,  and  is  the  next 
in  importance  to  Cincinnati.  It  is  situated  in  Cuyahoga  coun- 
t}',  upon  the  Southern  shore  of  Lake  Erie,  upon  the  east  side  of 
the  Cuyahoga  river,  at  its  mouth,  where,  also,  is  the  northern 
termination  of  the  greit  Ohio  canal.  It  is  distant  130  miles  N 
W  from  Pittsburgh;  140  N  E  from  Columbus;  200  by  water 
from  Buffalo,  and  130  from  Detroit.  N.  lat.  41  deg.  31  min. 
W.  long.  81  deg.  46  min.  or  4  deg.  44  min.  West  from  Wash- 
ington. 

The  city  derives  its  name  from  Moses  Cleveland,  the  agent 
of  the  Connecticut  Land  Company,  who  accompanied  the  first 
..purveying  party  upon  the  Connecticut  Western  Reserve,  and 
caused  a  plat  and  survey  to  be  made  of  Cleveland  in  1796,  two 
years  after  the  extinguishment  of  the  Indian  title,  and  before 
there  was  a  single  white  settler  in  that  part  of  the  N  W  Terri- 
tory. The  Indian  title  upon  the  west  side  of  the  river  was  not 
t-xtinguished  till  the  4th  of  July,  1805. 

Cleveland  was  incorporated  as  a  village,  Dec.  23, 1814,  and 
its  powers  vested  in  a  President  and  Trustees.  In  March,  1836, 
it  was  incorporated  as  a  city,  with  ample  powers  vested  in  a 
Mayor  and  Council,  elected  annually — the  Council  consisting 
of  three  members  from  each  Ward,  and  as  many  Aldermen  as 
Wards,  chosen  from  the  city  at  large.  There  are,  at  present, 
three  Wards,  and  all  citizens  are  voters  who  are  qualified  to 
vote  for  members  of  the  state  Legislature,  and  have  been 
one  year  resident  in  the  city.  Cleveland  was  regularly  organi- 
sed under  its  city  charter  on  the  11th  April,  1836.  The  Hon. 
.fohn  W  Willey,  lately  deceased,  was  the  first  Mayor,  and  was 
also  re-elected  the  second  year — great  credit  is  awarded,  and 
justly  due  him,  for  putting  into  successful  operation,  the  ma- 
chinery of  the  cit}'^  government. 

Northern  Ohio  was  almost  an  unknown  region,  till  the  sur- 
rey in  1796.  A  few  families,  soon  after,  found  their  way  to 
the  mouth  of  the  Cuyahoga,  but  did  not  permanently  settle 
there,  and  in  1799  one  family  only  remained  at  Cleveland — it 
was  the  family  of  Lorenzo  Carter. 

Forty  years  ago,  the  Lake  Cotmiry  was  considered  as  forever 


•294 

cut  off  and  secluded  from  the  business  world,  by  distance  from 
market,  and  impediments  which  it  had  not  been  dreamed  could 
be  overcome.  Since  then,  the  extraordinary  improvements  of 
the  age,  by  canals,  rail  roads,  and  steam  boats,  in  connexion 
with  the  great  chain  of  lakes,  have  given  to  th^it  solitary  region, 
a  teeming  population,  and  the  choice  of  markets  throughout  the 
world.  Cleveland,  which  was  unheard  of,  till  the  war  of  1812 
brought  it  slightly  into  notice,  received  and  cleared  by  canal, 
alone,  in  1840,  the  immense  quantities  of  produce  and  other 
property  exhibited  in  the  following  table,  by  D  H  Beardsley, 
Canal  Collector  at  Cleveland.

lowing are  the  principal  articles  of  property  that  were  cleared 
from  Cleveland,  by  way  of  the  canal,  during  the  past  year,  viz:

Much  of  the  flour,  wheat  and  pork,  shipped  from  Cleveland 
and  other  Lake  ports,  goes  through  the  Welland  canal,  (  a  ship 
canal,)  and  Lake  Ontario,  to  Montreal,  and  is  shipped  thence 
10  Great  Britain,  under  a  system  of  duties  more  favorable  than 
to  direct  shipment  from  U.  S.  ports,  and  framed  to  secure  to  Bri- 
tish bottoms  the  carrying  trade. 

The  harbor  at  Cleveland  has  been  greatly  improved  by  th« 
General  Government,  and  is  one  of  the  best  and  easiest  of  ac- 
cess of  the  lake  harbors.  It  is  still  in  charge  of  the  officers  of 
Government,  to  be  furnished  in  the  most  substantial  and  endur- 
ing manner  by  stone  masonry.  The  piers  are  extended  into  the 
lake  about  425  yards  and  are  200  feet  apart.  In  the  event  of  a 
war  with  England  each  party  would  deem  the  possession  of 
this  harbor  of  the  greatest  importance,  and  more  particularly  on 
account  of  the  juncture  with  it,  of  the  great  Ohio  canal — should 
the  British  obtain  the  mastery  of  the  Lake  it  would  fall  an  easy 
prey  into  their  hands,  unless  strongly  fortified  and  defended. 

Ohio,  as  shown  by  the  statistics  of  tlic  late  census,  is  th« 
greatest  grain  growing  state  of  the  Union,  and  Cleveland  is  the 
mart  to  which  the  largest  proportion  of  its  surplus  accumulates, 
for  distribution  to  the  New  Yor^k,  Canat'a,  and  other  markets. 

The  Cross  Cut,  or  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio  canai,  85  miles  in 
length,  connects  the  Ohio  canal  at  Al&lt;ron,  with  the.  Heaver  ca- 
nal at  New  Castle,  and  was  opened  in  1640,  and  is  becoming- 
of  great  benefit  to  Cleveland  and  Pittsburgh,  b}'^  the  convenient 
and  cheap  communication  it  furnishes  the  tv/ocii'u-.ei — it  opens 
to  Pittsburgh  the  whole  chain  of  Lakes  for  the  nx&gt;?.ptian  of  hec 
manufactories.

from  Louisville.     It  is  a  very  healthy  and  pleasant  place,  sur- 
rounded by  a  large  extent  of  well  settled  country.     There  is   a 
rail  road  in  progress  which   leads  from  the   town  to  Indianapo- 
lis, the  state  capital,  which  road  is  nearly  finished.     This  town

business.     There  are  a  very   few  places  iji  the  whole  western

The  town  of  New  Brighton  is  admirably  situated,  both  as  re- 
spects conveniences  of  building  and  water  privikges  on  the 
eastern  bank  of  the  Beaver  river,  about  three  miles  above  its 
mouth.  The  village  is  well  laid  out  in  broad  streets  crossing 
at  right  angles  to  each  other,  and  many  of  the  private  tesiden- 
ees  are  neatly  built  and  tastefully  adorned  with  shrubbery  and 
shade  trees.  At  either  end  of  the  town  a  bridge  crosses  the 
Beaver  river,  one  connecting  it  with  the  town  of  Brighton  and 
the  other  with  the  borough  of  Fallston.  These  bridges  are 
owned  by  stock  companies,  and  add  much  to  the  appearance  of 
the  place.  The  water  privileges  of  New  Brighton,  are  hardly 
surpassed  in  the  west.  Situated  as  it  is,  on  the  Falls  of  the 
Beaver,  with  the  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio  Canal  passing  thro' 
it,  the  quantity  of  machinery  which  might  be  put  in  opera- 
tion here,  is  almost  unlimited.  The  surrounding  agricultural 
country,  supplies  all  necessary  produce,  and  the  water  connnu- 
nication,  both  east  and  west,  is  of  the  most  constant  aad  conve- 
nient character.  It  will  at  once  be  seen  that  with  these  facili- 
ties it  would  be  a  profitable  place  for  the  investment  of  capital. 
There  are  at  present  in  the  place  several  factories  and  manu- 
factories of  various  kinds,  as  well  as  many  industrious  and  en- 
terprising merchants,  mechanics  and  farm.ers.  There  are  1 
Presbj^terian,  1  ^Methodist,  1  Seceder,  1  Unionist,  and  2  Friends 
places  of  public  worship.  The  office  of  the  Beaver  county  In- 
surance company  is  here.  This  company  has  a  capital  of  $400,- 
000,  all  paid  in  and  well  secured.  R.  Townsend,  President, 
Edward  Hoops,  Secretary.  There  is  a  branch  office  in  Pitts- 
burgh, of  which  M  B  Lowrie,  Esq.  is  actuary.  The  New 
Brighton  Female  Seminary,  under  the  care  of  Mrs.  E*  Critch- 
low,  is  an  excellent  school  of  the  higher  class.  The  New 
Brightou  Institute,  a  society  for  literary  and  scientific  purposes 
has  been  several  years  in  existence,  and  competed  as  itis  of  the 
best  heads  in  the  county,  has  done  much  to  promote  the  march 
of  intelligence  among  its  members  and  their  associates.  It  has 
a  library  and  a  cabinet  of  curiosities,  and  its  proceedings  are 
conducted  on  the  Lvceum  principle.     The  following  is  a

PRINCIPAL  HOTELS 

IN  THE 

targer  Cities  and  Towns 

IN  THE  UNITED  STATES. 

Anxious  to  make  our  work  as  generally  useful  as  possible,  to 
the  business  and  traveling  community,  we  have  prepared  a  list 
of  the  principal  Hotels  in  the  Cities  and  Towns  in  the  United 
States,  so  far  as  we  could  conveniently  collect  and  arrange  them* 
We  may  have  omitted  some  for  want  of  correct  information 
and  returns  to  our  solicitations;  such  must  excuse  us.  Those 
in  the  cities  and  towns  embraced  in  the  Directory  are  noticed 
under  the  head  of  the  towns  in  which  they  are  situated.  We 
believe  this  is  the  first  general  list  published  in  any  Directory 
of  the  kind,  for  we  could  not  find  such  a  list  in  any  of  them 
which  we  have  seen.
