Avery Seaman<br>
top sailor among sailors <br>
Longtime Middletown resident and "a top sailor among sailors" Avery Seaman, 77, <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/60525/" target="_blank">died</a> at his home in Ocala, Florida on April 11. He was the former president of Corp Brothers, organizer of the 1976 Tall Ships and Commodore of the Cruising Club of America from 1990 to 1991.
Born in Providence, Mr. Seaman developed an early love of boats from his parents, the late David S. and Elizabeth Sweet Seaman. According to long-time friend, Pierre Irving, an executive committee of the Preservation Society of Newport, Mr. Avery had a penchant for sailing on every scale. In the early 1960s the Irving and Seaman families vacationed together at a small lake in Dublin, New Hampshire. "The lake had a very small sailing club and Avery bought a Dublin lake boat that he completely refinished. He stripped it and varnished the whole boat." He became commodore of the Dublin Sailing Club when he was in his early 40s. "I was only 12 when I spent the summer at the lake, Avery influenced me. Through the years he was always very supportive of my sailing endeavors," said Irving.
Mr. Seaman volunteered to help organize the Tall Ships arrival in Newport for the bicentennial in 1976. Along with Vice Admiral Thomas Weschler who had just retired from the Navy and moved to Middletown, Mr. Seaman was tasked with coordinating anchorage for the ships. "There wasn t enough pier space for the ships in Newport Harbor, so Avery was very effective in getting moorings that the Navy had used for mine nets. It was a real logistics feat, but Avery did it skillfully." Vice Admiral Weschler added, "Avery was the kind of person you d enjoy standing a long watch with. He was a great help to me as I began organizing the Tall Ships 2000 in Newport."
In the late 1970s Mr. Seaman bought Boothden, former residence of John Wilkes Booth s brother, on Indian Avenue in Middletown. A craftsman, Mr. Seaman, set about restoring the house as well as an old barn that was on the property that he converted to a workshop. "He loved to build things with his hands," according to Mr. Irving. "Avery always had a project going and a group of people helping him. He was a great motivator."
An avid sailor, Mr. Seaman raced his Cal 40 "Conquest" in Narragansett Bay and throughout the Northeast. He completed more than 15 Newport-to-Bermuda races and 4 transatlantic crossings. In 1990 he became commodore of the Cruising Club of America, a private club with a membership of 1,100 top sailors among sailors. He was a former board member of the New York Yacht Club, former commodore and honorary member of the 2000 Club, past president of the Narragansett Boat Club, past president of the Brown University Rowing Association and a member of the East Greenwich Yacht Club.
Trudy Coxe, former executive director of Save the Bay said of Avery Seaman, "He is one of my angels because when Save the Bay was young, he, as a true believer and a respected business owner and civic leader, had enough juice to recruit other business leaders into helping the clean up of Narragansett Bay. As such, he headed the first corporate campaign for Save the Bay and his success changed the dynamics of the organization." On a personal note, she adds, "He was a real gentleman, full of heart, and always caring."
Among his many accomplishments, Mr. Seaman was a graduate of Exeter Academy and Yale University and a Navy veteran of World War II. He was a past president of the National Welding Supply Association and a co-founder of the Providence Chapter of the American Welding Supply. He was past president of the Agawam Hunt Club and the Yale Club of Rhode Island and was a member of the Newport Reading Room, Spouting Rock Beach Association, Newport Clambake Club, Hope Club and Newport Country Club. He was active with the Narragansett Chapter of the Boy Scouts and a member of St. Martin s Church in Providence and St. Columba s Chapel of middletown.
He was the husband of Eleanor (Kritzer) Seaman. Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Pamela Jean Seaman of Chicago, two sons, John Scott Seaman of Brookline, MA, and Avery "Whip" Seaman, Jr. of Portsmouth, and three grandchildren. He was the brother of the late David Sands Seaman, Jr.

Natalie Winslow, 91, a long-time resident of Coggeshall Avenue in Newport <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/60525/" target="_blank">died</a> at the Grand Islander Center in Middletown on Monday, April 25. She was the daughter of Nathaniel J. and Violet Hess. Mr. Hess, a New York stockbroker, kept a stable of hunters at their Long Island home, where he started Natalie in the art of horsemanship and devotion to animals that would stay with her for her entire life. She participated in many equestrian events, most notably, riding at the prestigious Madison Square Garden Horse Show.
Mrs. Winslow was educated at the Convent of the Sacred Heart on New York City and later in Italy. As a young woman, she served with the American Red Cross during World War II in Italy. "Natalie told me once that she was in love with an Italian prince but his family wouldn t accept her because she was a commoner," stated a long -time friend, Muriel Case. She went on to say, "Natalie was a very endearing person."
While still in Italy, Mrs Winslow met and <a href="https://www.archives.com/search/?location=US&tid=context_married&cam=5495">married</a> Commander Cameron McRae Winslow, a Navy Cross hero. Commander Winslow <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/60525/" target="_blank">died</a> in 1981.
Her lifelong interest in and concern for animals led Mrs. Winslow to the Potter League for Animals. "Back in the 1950s Mrs. Winslow saw a need to revitalize the League and continued her work here for fifty years. So much of her life centered around her love of animals," stated Christie Smith, executive director of the Potter League. One of the activities for which she is well-recognized is the Annual Blessing of the Animals, which she helped to organize and attended every year with her Cairn Terriers.
Mrs. Winslow founded the Newport Dog Training School, which met at Rovensky Park. People who knew her commented that while she was able to train the dogs of others, she met with limited success with her own dogs.
"While on the Newport Show House Committee for Hope Farm in Bristol, I decorated a dog house on the property and dedicated it to Natalie. She was so dedicated to her dogs, it seemed only fitting," stated Dottie Wheeler.
A memorial funeral service was held on Tuesday, May 1 at St. Augustin Church in Newport. Donations may be made in her memory to the Potter League for Animals, Box 412, Newport RI.
