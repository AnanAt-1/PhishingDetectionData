TO 

Lord  Mount  Stephen, 

MOxXTREAL. 


I  have  much  pleasure  in  dedicating^  this  volume  on  the  History 
and  Biographical  Gazetteer  of  Montreal  to  your  Lordship,  for  the 
followinof  reasons  : — 

ist.  You  have  been  a  citizen  of  Montreal  nearly  all  your  life,  "a  citizen  of  no 
mean  city  "  ; 

2nd.  You  have  been  connecled  with  the  progress  of  the  City  for  many  years, 
and  in  many  ways  ; 

^rd.  You  have  been  intimately  connecled  with,  and  instrumental  in,  beginning 
and  developing  that  great  undertaking,  '•^The  Canadian  Pacific  Rai/zaay,"  which  now 
spans  this  Continent,  and  of  which  you  were  once  the  President ; 

4th.     You  are  one  of  the  two  who  have  given  to  the  City  of  Montreal  "  The 
Jubilee  Victoria  flos/fita/" — a  gift,  in  conjunction  with  that  of  Sir  Donald  Smith's,  of 
such  amo..ii     '--^•^  '"*  stand's  or  ~  nf  the  larges'  ever  donated  in    lis  country  for  a  public 
purpose  ; 

5th.  But  especially  because  Her  Most  Gracious  Majesty  The  Queen,  in  recog- 
nizing worth,  has  raised  you  to  the  Peerage  of  Great  Britain,  under  the  title  of  the 
highest  and  most  magnificent  of  ^A\  the  Canadian  peaks  of  the  Rocky  Mountains — 
^'Lord  Afoitnt  Stephen  " — which  title  1  pray  you  may  be  long  spared  to  bear,  and, 
with  '^  Lady  Mount  Stephen,"  enjoy  years  of  health  and  happiness,  not  only  in  Old 
England,  but  in  that  City   which  feels  proud  of  you  and  your  well-earned  honors — 

Montreal. 

I  remain, 

Your  Lordship's  obedient  servant, 

J.  DOUGLAS  BORTHVVICK.

PREFACE. 


Several  books  on  Canadian  Biography  have  been  printed  since  I  issued  ilie  first 
one,  in  book  form  and  illustrated,  sixteen  years  ago.  They  generally  take  in  the 
whole  Dominion — this  present  volume  is  devoted  to  Montreal  alone.  I  have 
endeavored  to  make  this  volume  of  such  ])articular  character,  that  it  may  become  of 
some  value  as  a  book  of  reference  and  a  guide  in  wliich  many  interesting  items  (in 
connection  with  the  old  and  modern  families  of  the  City)  will  be  found  therein.  The 
History  of  Montreal  will  be  an  important  item  of  the  work.  Very  many  items  of 
historical  interest  were  exhumed  by  me  from  the  Records  of  the  Court  House  and 
the  Montreal  Gaol  relative  to  the  old  customs  and  manners  of  our  citizen  fore- 
fathers, and  during  some  of  the  stirring  periods  of  her  history.  A  few  extracts  from 
men  of  note  and  position,  and  who  are  calculated  to  be  the  best  judges  of  these 
things,  will  give  a  fair  idea  that  I  have  done  something  towards  saving  from  oblivion 
the  interesting  memorials  of  Montreal  and  its  environs.  The  well-known  Canadian 
Litterateur,  J.  M.  Le  Moine,  Esquire,  of  Quebec,  writes  :  "  I  must  commend  your 
broad  and  liberal  views  of  matters  generally  affecting  the  Colony." 

HoNiiLE.  Judge  Babv,  of  the  Historical  Society,  as  its  President,  says  : — *'  Tiiey 
contain  a  most  excellent  resume  of  the  subject  you  treat  of;"  and  in  writing  of  the 
Records  of  Montreal  he  says  that  they  "  contain  much  valuable  information  for 
which  the  public  is  certainly  indebted  to  you." 

Tliis  is  endorsed  by  Mr.  J.  M.  Le  Moine,  one  ofthebestofall  Canadian  Litterateurs 
and  writers,  when  he  says  in  a  letter  of  date  ist  July,  1890  :  "  I  have  read  with  much 
interest  in  the  Star  your  history  of  the  origin  of  the  names  of  the  Montreal  streets, 
and  hope  it  will  be  preserved  in  the  more  durable  shape  of  a  brochure.  Such  infor- 
mation, I  am  sure,  will  find  thousands  of  readers  in  Montreal  and  elsewhere." 

L.O.  David,  Esquire,  the  well-known  writer  and  Historian  of  1837-3S,  etc.,  says  : 
— "  J'ai  lu  avec  le  plus  grand  interet  le  livrc  que  vous  venez  de  publier  sur  les  evene- 
menls  de  1837-38.  Vous  avez  le  merite  d'avoir  fait  connaitre  une  foule  de  details 
et  de  documents  oflficiels  relalifs  a  ces  evenemcnts." 

Louis  J.  A.  Papineau,  Esquire,  son  of  the  fiimous  Leader,  writing  from  "  Monte 
Pello,"  says  : — "  It  is  full  of  statistical  facts  that  were  generally  unknown,  and  which 
must  have  cost  you  much  care  and  research.  It  is  a  precious  collection  to  add  to 
our  Iiistorical  records." 

RouER  Roy,  Esquire,  says : — "  It  certainly  reflects  great  credit  on  your  efforts 
to  collect  all  possible  information  on  the  subject." 


6  PREFACE. 

The  History  of  Montreal,  in  the  first  i)nrt  of  this  volume,  will  contain,  then,  a 
very  large  amount  of  items  culled  from  all  the  writings  of  the  Author  for  years  past, 
and  this  feature  will  give  it,  I  believe,  much  more  interest  than  that  of  any  previous 
work  on  the  same  subject. 

To  all  who  have  assisted  me  in  the  literary  part,  and  especially  to  V.  S.  Murphy, 
Esquire,  for  his  interesting  article  in  La  Croix  /^oui;e,  I  return  my  sincere  thanks. 
Many  of  the  IJiograiihical  sketches  will  be  read  with  much  interest.  Interwoven 
with  them  are  numerous  items  of  History  which  otherwise  would  never  have  seen  the 
light  of  day. 

Lastly,  to  all  my  patrons  and  subscribers.  I  return  my  most  hearty  thanks  for 
the  promptitude  and  readiness  shown  in  enabling    me  to  bring  out  the  work.

HISTORY   OF   MONTREAL. 


j)v  the  first  missionariL's  sent  out  to  Canada  from  iMuncc  it  was  soon  jjcrceivLHi 
thai  the  (;ccii]):ition  and  dcft-ncc  of  the  Island  of  Montreal  was  an  object  of  llie 
greatest  importance,  nay  rendered  indeed  imperative,  if  tlie  l'"rench  wished  to  retain  . 
authority  in  the  Island;  l)ut  '"The  Company"  in  1'" ranee  were  unwilling  to  second 
their  views  in  this  respect.  It  fell,  therefore,  to  the  lot  of  some  private  individuals  to' 
accomplish  this  good  design.  Several  ])ersons  in  France,  full  of  religious  zeal,  formed  , 
themselves  into  a  Society  consistnig  of  ihirly-five  members,  for  the  purpose  of  colon-  ;; 
izing  the  Island  of  Montreal.  It  was  proposed  that  a  I'rench  village  should  be 
estal)lished,  and  be  well  fortified,  that  the  poorer  class  of  emigrants  should  there  fnid 
an  asylum  and  emi)loyment,  and  the  rest  of  the  Island  be  occupied  by  such  friendly 
tribes  of  Indians  as  should  embrace  Christianity,  or  wish  to  receive  religious  instruc- 
tion :  and  it  was  hoped  lh:it  in  time  they  might  become  accustomed  to  civilized  liie. 
The  greater  jKirt  of  the  Island  had  been  granted  to  Messrs.  Charrier  and  I,e  Royer, 
whether  disposed  of  by  them  or  forfeited  to  the  Crown  does  not  appear  from  any 
official  record  that  has  been  preserved.  The  king,  however,  ceded  the  whole  of  it, 
in  1641,  to  this  Society,  who  took  formal  possession  of  it,  at  the  conclusion  of  a  grand 
mass  which  was  celebrated  on  the  occasion.  'I'he  following  vear  M.  de  Maisonneuve. 
one  of  the  Associates,  brought  out  several  families  from  France,  and  was  appointed 
Governor  of  the  Island.  "On  the  iSth  of  May,  1642,  the  spot  destined  for  the  City 
was  consecrated  by  the  Superior  of  the  Jesuits,  who  also  dedicated  a  small  chapel, 
hastily  constructed,  in  which  he  deposited  The  Most.  'I'his  ceremony  had  been  ])re- 
ceded  three  months  before  by  a  similar  one  in  Paris,  where  all  the  Associates  went 
together  to  the  Church  of  Xolre  Dame;  those  of  them  who  were  priests  officiated, 
and  all  supi)licated  the  '•Queen  of  Angels  "  to  take  the  Island  under  her  jjroiec- 
tion.  The  ceremony,  at  Montreal,  was  celebrated  on  the  i8th  of  August;  a  great 
number,  French  and  Indians,  were  present,  and  nothing  was  omitted  which  could 
give  to  the  natives  a  lofty  idea  of  the  C'hristian  Religion.  'J'hus  "a  few  houses," 
as  UourlK'tte  observes,  "built  close  together  in  the  year  1642  on  the  site  of  the 
Indian  village  of  Hochelaga,  was  the  commencement  of  tlic  City  of  Montreal,  or, 
as  it  was  first  named,  "  ^'ille  Marie."  Parkman,  the  Historian,  thus  speaks  of  this 
interesting  event : — 

"  Maisonxkuvk  sprang  ashore  and  fell  on  his  knees.  His  followers  imitated 
his  example;  and  all  joined  their  voices  in  enthusiastic  songs  of  thanksgiving. 
Tents,  baggage,  arni  and  stores,  were  laiuLcl.  An  altar  was  raised  on  a  pleasant 
si)ot  near  the  landing,  and  Mademoiselle  Mance,  with  Madame  de  la  Peltrie,  aided 
by  her  servant,  Charlotte  l^)arre,  decorated  it  with  a  taste  which  was  the  admiration 


8  HISTORY  OK  MONTREAL. 

of  the  beholders.  Now  all  the  company  gathered  before  The  Shrine.  Here  stood 
Vincent  in  the  rich  vestments  of  his  office.  Here  were  the  two  ladies  with  their 
servant;  Montniagny,  no  very  willing  spectator;  and  Maisonneuve,  a  warlike  figure, 
erect  and  tall — his  men  clustering  around  him.  They  kneeled  in  reverent  silence 
as  The  Host  was  raised  aloft ;  and  when  the  rite  was  over,  the  priest  turned  and 
addressed  them  :  '  You  are  a  grain  of  mustard  seed  tliat  shall  rise  and  grow  till  its 
branches  overshadow  the  eartl;.  You  are  (e\v,  but  this  work  is  the  work  of  God. 
His  smile  is  on  you,  and  your  children  shall  fill  the  land.'" 

Of  the  truth  of  this  good  man's  prophecy,  we,  living  250  years  afterwards,  have 
an  abundant  \noof.  The  small  mustard  seed  has  indeed  become  a  great  tree,  and 
the  various  nations  of  the  Old  World  have  lodged  and  are  lodging  in  the  branches 
thereof. 

"The  afternoon  waned,  the  sun  sank  behind  the  western  forest  and  twilight 
came  on.  Fireflies  were  twinkling  over  the  darkened  meadow.  They  caught  them, 
tied  them  with  threads  into  shining  festoons  and  hung  them  before  the  altar.  Then 
they  pitched  their  tents,  lighted  their  fires,  stationed  their  guards,  and  lay  down 
to  rest.     Such  was   the  birthnight  of  Montreal." 

Another  writer  (Sandham)  says  thus: — "The  following  morning  they  proceeded 
to  form  their  encampment — the  first  tree  being  felled  by  Maisonneuve.  They  worked 
with  such  energy  that,  by  the  evening,  they  had  erected  a  strong  palisade,  and  had 
covered  their  altar  with  a  roof  made  of  bark. 

"  On  the  evening  of  this  memorable  day,  Maisonneuve  visited  the  Mountain. 
Two  old  Indians  who  accompanied  him,  having  conducted  him  to  the  summit,  told 
him  that  they  belonged  to  the  nation  which  had  formerly  occupied  the  country  he 
beheld.  '  We  were,'  said  they,  '  a  niunerous  peojjle  by  us.  The  Hurons  drove 
from  thence  om*  ancestors,  some  of  whom  took  refuge  with  the  Abenaquis,  some 
with  the  Iroquois,  and  some  remained  with  their  conquerors.'  The  Governor  urged 
the  old  men  to  invite  their  brethren  to  return  to  their  hunting-grounds,  assuring 
them  that  they  should  want  for  nothing,  and  that  he  would  protect  them  from  every 
attack  of  their  enemies.  This  incident  awakened  feelings  of  no  ordinary  interest 
in  the  bosom  of  the  Governor.  The  unbounded  tract  that  opened  itself  to  his 
view  discovered  to  him  dark,  thick,  and  deep  forest?,  whose  height  alone  was  a 
proof  of  their  anti(piity.  Large  rivers  came  down  from  a  considerable  distance  to 
water  these  immense  regions.  Everything  appeared  grand.  Nature  here  displayed 
great  luxuriancy." 

"  It  was  some  considerable  time  after  their  arrival  before  their  enemies,  the 
India;''',  were  made  aware  of  it,  and  they  improved  the  time  by  building  some 
substantial  houses  and  in  strengthening  their  fortificatio!is.  In  this  way  they  passed 
the  Summer,  and  all  seemed  bright,  when  in  the  month  of  December  the  River  St. 
Lawrence  rose  rapidly  and  threatened  to  destroy  the  result  of  their  toil.  The  flood 
rose  until  it  filled  the  fort  and  ditch  and  reached  the  foot  of  their  fortifications  ; 
but  it  then  receded  slowly  and  they  were  safe."

"While  the  water  was  rising,  Maisonneuve  made  a  vow  that,  should  the  danger 
be  averted,  he  would  cause  a  cross  to  be  made,  and  would  bear  the  same  upon  his 
shoulders  and  fix  it  on  the  lop  of  the  mountain.  He  now  i)roceeded  to  fulfil  his 
vow,  and  in  January,  1643,  he  set  his  men  to  work  to  clear  a  road  up  the  mountain. 
When  this  was  completed,  they  formed  a  procession,  headed  by  one  of  the  Jesuits, 
and  followed  by  Maisonneuve  '  bearing  a  cross  so  heavy  that  he  could  scarcely 
ascend  the  mountain.'  When  they  arrived  at  the  highest  crest  of  the  mountain,  the 
cross  was  erected,  and  all  knelt  to  worship  before  it.  Mass  was  said  and  the  Sacra- 
ment was  administered  to  Madame  de  la  Peltrie." 

The  Indians  were  continually  a  sourcj  of  great  trouble,  anxiety  and  danger  to 
these  early  settlers,  as  indeed  they  were  for  two  hundred  years  afterwards  to  settlers 
all  (ner  the  Continent  of  America.  These  Red  Men  would  watch  sometimes  for 
days  for  any  one  to  pass  the  palisades,  and  then  pounce  upon  the  unfortunate  straggler,, 
tomahawk  him,  scalp  him.  and  brutally  murder  him.  This  occasioned  Maisonneuve 
to  order  that  no  man  should  go  out  or  be  near  the  outside  walls  without  permission, 
which  rule  was  imputed  by  his  men  to  cowardice  on  the  part  of  their  leader.  This 
so  galled  him  that  he  determined  to  show  that  he  was  as  brave  as  they  were,  and 
ordered  his  men  to  prepare  to  attack  the  enemy  and  he  would  lead  them  himself. 

•'  He  sallied  forth  at  the  head  of  thirty  men,  leaving  d'Aillebout  with  the  balance 
to  hold  the  fort.  After  they  had  waded  through  the  snow  for  some  distance,  they 
were  attacked  by  the  Iroquois,  who  killed  three  of  his  men  and  wounded  several 
others,  .^^aisonneuve  and  his  party  held  their  ground  until  their  annnunition  began 
to  fail,  and  then  he  gave  orders  to  retreat,  he  himself  remaining  to  the  last.  The 
men  struggled  onward  for  some  time  facing  the  enemy,  but  finally  they  broke  their 
ranks  and  retreated  in  great  disorder  towards  the  fi)rt.  Maisonneuve,  with  a  pistol 
in  each  hand,  held  the  Indians  in  check  for  some  time.  They  might  have  killed  him, 
but  they  wished  to  take  hiui  prisoner.  Their  chief,  desiring  this  honor,  rushed  fi)r- 
ward  ;  but.  just  as  he  was  about  to  grasp  him,  Maisonneuve  fired  and  he  fell  dead. 
The  Indians,  fearing  that  the  body  of  their  chief  would  fall  into  the  hands  of  the 
French,  rushed  fi)rward  to  secure  ''.,  and  Maisonne.ive  passed  safely  within  the  fijrt. 
From  that  day  his  men  never  dared  to  impute  cowardice  to  him." 

One  of  the  most  effective  of  the  guardians  of  the  fort  was  a  female  dog  named 
''Pilot"  and  a  number  of  other  well-trained  sagacious  dogs.  I&lt;^very  morning  regu- 
larly these  animals,  headed  bv  "  Pilot,"  would  i)airol  and  make  a  reconnoiterimr 
tour  all  over  the  town.  It  is  said  she  trained  her  own  young  to  be  most  valuable 
allies  to  their  masters,  ^\■henever  these  dogs  perceived  any  traces  of  the  Iroquois, 
and  more  especially  when  "  Pilot  "  had  discovered  any  signs,  then  back  they  ran  to 
the  fort,  giving  a  particular  bay  to  intimate  that  danger  was  nigh.  Then  the  colonists 
became  alert,  and  they  had  need  to  be,  fi)r  already  had  \]vc  Frenchmen  lallen  before

erected  to  commemorate  the  event  of  each  locality?  Tiic  citizens  of  Montreal  have 
at  last  bestirred  themselves,  and  many  tablets  are  being  placed  throughout  the  City  in 
connection  with  his  suggestion. 

In  the  year  1644,  ^'1^'  whole  Island  became  the  jjroperty  of  the  St.  Sal[)icians  at 
Paris,  and  was  by  them  afterwards  conveyed  to  the  ScMninary  at  Montreal,  in  whose 
possjssion  much  of  it  still  remains. 

In  1649,  a  i)Oor  girl  of  Montreal  was  executed,  and  only  sixteen  years  of  age,  for 
a  petty  tiieft,  and  now  it  seems  she  was  innocent. 

The  year  1660  should  ever  be  remembered  in  the  History  of  Canada  for  the  act 
of  noble  self-devotion  of  Adam  d'.\-alac,  vSieur  des  (Jrmeaux,  and  his  sixteen  brave 
companions,  who  met  the  Iroquois  whilst  descending  the  Ottawa  on  their  way  to 
attack  the  settlements  of  Montreal.  D'Aulac.  witli  his  few  followers  of  white  men, 
aided  by  a  party  of  Huron  Indians — the  niiijority  of  wliom.  however,  during  the  night 
deserted  the  Fiench  and  went  over  10  the  Irocpiois  (who  were  always  their  enemies) 
— liHik  possession  of  a  small  fort  of  palisade  work,  and  defended  themselves  with 
such  dauntless  and  persistent  vigor  that  when  he  and  all  his  while  companions  with 
the  few  faithful  Ilurons  were  slain,  it  made  such  an  impression  on  the  warlike  Iroquois 
th:it  tiiey  returned  home,  sullen,  dejected  a'ld  discontented.  Only  live  men  (Huron 
Indi.ins)  escaped  and  reached  .Montreal  in  s;ifelv,  bringing  the  disastrous  news. 

In  the  }ear  16S9,  Montreal  and  the  whole  Island  fearfully  experienced  the 
tieachery  of  the  Indians  in  tlie  '■  Lachine  M;issacre."  A  well-known  Historian  thus 
describes  the  event  : — '•  The  winter  and  sjjring  of  16SS-89  had  been  passed  in  an 
unusually  tranquil  manner,  and  the  smnmer  was  preliy  well  advanced,  when  the 
storm  suddenly  fell  on  the  beautiful  Island  of  Montreal.  During  the  night  of  the  5tli 
Augu.-t.  1400  Iroquois  Iraversed  the  Lake  St.  Louis  and  disembarked  silently  on  the 
upper  part  of  ihe  Island,  liefore  daybreak,  next  );iorning,  the  invaders  had  taken 
their  station  at  Lachine — in  platoons  around  each  house  within  the  radius  of  several 
leagues.  Tl;e  inmates  were  buried  in  sleep — soon  to  be  the  dreamless  sleep  that 
knows  no  waking,  for  many  of  them.  Ihe  Irtxpiois  only  wailed  for  a  signal  from 
their  leaders  to  begin  the  attack.  It  was  given.  In  a  short  space  the  doors  and 
the  windows  of  the  dwellings  were  broken  in.  the  sleei)ers  dragged  from  their  beds  ; 
men,  women  and  i  hildren,  all  struggling  in  the  hands  of  their  butchers,  .Such  houses 
as  the  savages  cannot  force  their  way  into,  they  fire  ;  and,  as  the  tlames  reach  the 
l)ersons  within,  intolerable  pain  drives  them  forth  to  meet  death  from  beyond  the 
threshold  from  beings  who  know  no  jnly.  The  fiendish  murderers  forced  jiarents  to 
throw  their  children  into  the  llames.  Two  hundred  ])ersons  were  burnt  alive  ;  as 
many  more  were  reser\etl  to  perish  similarly  at  a  future  time,  'i'he  fair  island  upon 
which  the  sun  shone  brightly  erewhile,  was  lighted  up  by  fires  of  woe ;  houses,  ])lan- 
Mtions  and  crops  were  reduced  to  ashes,  while  the  ground  reeked  with  blood  to  a 
sh(!rl  league  from  Montreal.  The  savages  crossed  to  the  opposite  shore — the  desf)- 
l.ilion  behind  them  being  complete,  and  forthwith  the  Parish  of  1  ,a  Chenie  was  wasteil 
by  lire  and  inan\'  of  the  people  massacred.  Tiie  savages  lost  but  tliri'e  men  in  the 
wtU'k  of  desolation."

Again,  in  1691,  a  large  br;dy  of  these  same  Indians.  cml&gt;oldencd  by  the  liavoc 
thev  had  made  in  16S9,  advanced  along  the  Riclielieu  to  attack  Montreal  ;  but  they 
were  signally  repulsed  by  de  Callieres.  Tiiey,  however,  treated  with  the  greatest 
cruelty  all  who  fell  into  their  hands. 

In  i'')93,  a  considerable  army  of  seven  hundred  men,  under  Frontenac,  was 
assembled  at  Montreal  to  chastise  the  Mohawks  and  other  tribes  of  Iroquois.  After 
some  lime  they  returned  to  Montreal  without  accomplishin"  much.  This  caused,  in 
1695.  the  Indians  to  retaliate  by  landing  on  the  Island  and  committing  some  depre- 
dations and  killing  several  ])ersons.  To  avenge  the  massacre  of  Lachine  and  this 
last  incursion,  l-'rontenac  started  from  Montreal,  July,  1695,  with  1000  men.  Em- 
barking at  Lachine.  he  i)assed  a  considerable  way  into  their  country,  but  met  no 
resistance.  The  e\i&gt;edilion  was  of  little  value  or  result,  t!ie  Indians  having  retired 
bcfiin' him.  He  shortly  afterwards  returned  to  Montreal  and  died  at  Quebec,  and 
was  buried  in  the  Ciiurch  of  the  Recollets  there.  The  Marquis  de  \'au(h-euil  was 
elected  the  Clovernor  of  Montreal  in  his  ])lace. 

Tiiw.uds  the  end  of  the  nionih  of  July,  1701,  no  less  than  r5oo  Indians 
assembled  at  Montreal.  These  included  the  Algonquins.  Ilurons,  converted  Irorpiois, 
several  other  tribes  and  some  of  the  Mve  Xalions.  A  grand  pow-wow  or  I'onferencc 
took  ]ilace,  which  ended  in  a  general  ])eace,  signed  by  all  concerned  on  the  4th  of 
the  following  August.  The  princi[)al  Redman  present  was  the  fimous  chief  Kon- 
diiironk  (LeRat).  who  has  been  styled  "an  Indian  only  in  name."  "  When  the 
deputies  arrived  in  July  foi'  the  purpose  of  'weeping  for  tiie  l''rench  who  had  been 
skiin  in  tliew.ir'  and  to  '  bury  their  hatchets,  over  which  should  run  a  stream  of 
water  in  the  earth,'  ;is  they  entered  the  town  they  were  saluted  by  the  great  guns 
arid  cannons  of  the  gariison.  This  caused  one  of  the  chiefs  of  the  Huron  Indians 
to  say  that  'fear  makes  the  French  show  more  respect  to  their  enemies,  th.an  love 
can  make  ihem  show  to  their  fi  iends." 

In  the  year  1710,  Montreal  was  again  in  danger,  as  (leneral  XicoNun,  the  Rriiish 
Commander  in  the  Fnglish  Colom'es.  prepared  then  to  move  o!i  it  with  a  force  of 
4000  I'rnvinciais  and  600  Indians.     This  expedition  f.iiled  and  Montreal  was  saved. 

I, el  me  here  describe  Montreal,  as  taken  from  an  old  volume  published  in  I'aris 
in  the  year  1721.  h  says  : — ■"•  The  town  of  Montreal  has  a  very  pleasing  aspect,  and 
is  besides  very  Cdiiveniently  silualed.  The  streets  are  well  laid  out  and  the  houses 
Well  built.  The  beauty  of  the  country  around  it,  and  of  its  jjiospccts,  ins])ires  a 
certain  cheerfulness  to  which  everybody  is  perfectly  sensible.  It  is  not  fcjrtified, 
only  a  simple  palisade  with  bastions  and  in  a  very  indifferent  C(Uidition,  with  a  sorry 
red(Uil)i  in  a  small  spot,  wliich  serves  as  a  sort  of  outwork  and  terminates  in  a  gentle 
declivity,  at  the  end  of  which  is  a  small  square,  which  is  all  the  defence  it  has." 

In  the  year  17^1  nviils  were  regularly  conveyed  between  Montreal  anil  (Jiu-hec 
for  the  first  time.  About  this  time  great  improvements  were  begun  and  completed 
on  the  fortifications  of  Montreal,  so  much  so  that  the  next  traveller,  describing  the 
place,  speaks  of  tliein  in  the  year  1749.     Kalm,  the   great  Swedish   naturalist,   thus 


12  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL. 

says: — "  Tlie  city  is  well  fortified,  surrounded  by  a  high  and  thick  wall.  In  front 
runs  the  river,  w'lile  on  tlie  oilier  side  is  a  deep  ditch,  filled  with  water,  which 
secures  the  inhabiiants  against  all  danger  from  sudden  incursions  of  the  enemy.  It 
cannot,  however,  stand  a  long  siege,  as,  on  account  of  its  extent,  it  would  require  a 
large  garrison.  There  are  several  churches  and  colleges.  Some  of  the  houses  are 
built  oi"  stone,  but  most  of  them  are  timber,  though  very  neatly  built.  Each  of  the 
better  sort  of  houses  has  a  dour  towards  the  street  with  a  seat  on  each  side  of  it,  for 
amusement  and  recreation  in  the  evening.  The  gates  of  the  town  are  numerous, 
there  being  five  on  the  river  side.  The  Governor-Cieneral,  when  here,  resides  in  the 
Castle,  wliich  is  hired  from  the  Vaudreuil  family. 

"Within  the  walls  is  a  nunnery  (Old  Ulack  Nunnery),  and  without  is  half  a  one 
(Grey  Nunnery),  and  though  the  latter  is  ([uiie  ready,  it  has  not  yet  been  confirmed 
by  the  Pope. 

"Every  Friday  is  market  day,  when  the  country  people  come  to  town  with  pro- 
visions, and  those  who  want  them  must  supply  themselves  on  that  day,  because  it  is 
the  only  market  day  in  the  week.  Numbers  of  Indians  may  then  be  seen  trying  to 
sell  furs  and  bead  work." 


THE  RED  CROSS. 

I  have  much  pleasure  to  present  here  to  my  readers  Mr.  P.  S.  Murphy's  history 
of  "  La  Croix  Rouge." — "  The  Red  Cross  is  at  the  corner  of  Guy  and  Dorchester 
streets,  which  for  a  century  and  a  quarter  has  so  prominently  marked  the  burial 
place  of  IJelisle,  the  murderer,  and  has  long  been  an  object  of  curious  speculation. 
The  popular  story  is  that  it  marks  the  grave  of  a  notorious  highwayman,  who  robbed 
and  murdered  habitants  returning  from  Montreal  to  St.  Laurent  and  the  back 
country  by  Dorchester  street,  which  was  at  that  time  the  only  highway  west  of  St. 
Lawrence  street.  This  story  is  somewhat  incorrect.  Bel  isle  was  not  a  highway 
robber,  his  crime  was  house-breaking  and  a  double  murder.  He  lived  on  Le  Grand 
Chemin  du  Roi,  now  called  Dorchester  street,  near  the  spot  where  the  Red  Cross 
stands.  On  the  other  side  of  the  road,  and  a  little  higher  up,  Jean  Favre  and  his  wife 
Marie-Anne  Bastien  lived,  Favre  was  reputed  to  bv  well  off  and  to  have  money 
in  his  house.  This  excited  the  cupidity  of  Belisle,  who  formed  the  project  of  robbing 
his  neighbor,  and  accordingly,  one  dark  night,  broke  into  the  house  and  fired  his  pistol 
at  Favre,  when,  however,  only  wounding  him,  he  stabbed  him  to  death  with  a  large 
hunting  knife.  Favre's  wife  rushed  in  to  help  her  husband,  and  was  met  by  Belisle, 
who  plunged  the  knife  into  her  breast,  and  then  despatched  her  by  a  blow  of  a  spade. 
Belisle  was  suspected,  and  soon  after  arrested,  tried,  convicted  and  condemned  to  the 
terrible  punishment  of  "breaking  alive"  (jomp-i  tv/^,  which  was  then  in  force 
under  the  French  regime  in  Canada.  Belisle  was  condemned  to  "  torture  ordinary 
and  extraordinary,"  then  to  be  broken  alive  on  a  scaffold  erected  in  the  niarke 
place  (the  present  Custom  House  Square)  in  tliis  city.

"  This  awful  sentence  was  carried  out  to  the  letter,  his  body  buried  in  Guy  street, 
and  the  Red  Cross  erected  to  mark  the  spot,  as  fully   described  in    the  following

'"  FOUCHKR.'" 

This  history  of  the  "  Red  Cross  "  was  narrated  lo  Mr.  Murphy,  nearly  fifty  years 
ago,  by  Ihe  widow  of  Louis  Haldimand,  a  nephew  of  General  Haldimand,  once 
Governor  of  Canada.  This  lady  was  born  in  1774,  and  heard  the  story  from  her 
nioiher,  who  lived  near  "  la  Place  du  Marche  "  (present  Custom  House  Square) 
when  the  execution  took  place. 

The  year  1759  will  ever  be  memorable  in  the  annals  of  Canada.  The  l''rench, 
perceiving  that  the  English  were  in  earnest  in  their  designs  upon  it,  sent  strong  rein- 
forcements to  their  garrisons.  The  campaign  opened  with  great  vigor.  Canada  was 
to  be  invaded  at  three  different  points  under  generals  of  high  talent.  The  forces 
intended  to  act  against  (Quebec  were  under  the  command  of  General  Wolfe,  who  had 
taken  Fort  Louisburg  and  subdued  the  Island  of  Cape  Breton  the  preceding  year. 
Wolfe's  army,  amounting  to  about  8000  men,  was  conveyed  to  the  vicinity  of  Quebec 
by  a  fleet  of  vessels  of  war  and  transports,  commanded  by  Admiral  Saunders,  and 
landed  in  two  divisions  on  the  Isle  of  Orleans,  the  27th  of  June.  The  French  Com- 
mander Montcalm  made  vigorous  preparations  for  defence.  He  arranged  his  army 
of  about  12,000  men  between  the  river  of  St.  Charles  and  the  Falls  of  Montmorenci, 
to  oppose  the  landing  of  the  British  forces,  which,  in  their  attack  upon  his  entrench- 
ments, were  repulsed.  Wolfe  at  first  doubted  from  this  failure  whether  anything 
could  be  effected  in  the  present  season  ;  but  afterwards,  rousing  his  brave  and  ardent 
spirit,  and  calling  a  council  of  war,  he  resolved  upon  the  bold  and  hazardous  enter-

prise  of  ascending  the  Heiglils  of  Abrab.am,  and  attacking  the  city  in  tliat  direction. 
The  ])hin  was  executed  with  admirable  skill  and  determination.  The  result  is  well 
known  ;  the  chiefs  on  both  sides  fell  and  left  behind  them  most  honorable  names. 
Wolfe  died  on  the  field  of  battle,  in  the  arms  of  victory  ;  and  Montcalm  in  the  city, 
to  which  he  had  been  carried,  thankful  that  he  should  not  live  to  see  the  surrender 
of  the  place.  The  battle  on  the  Plains  of  Abraham  was  fought  on  the  13th  of  Sep- 
tember, 1 759;  and  five  days  afterwards,  on  the  i8th,  Quebec  surrendered  to  tiie 
British  arms. 

l-'ighting  continued  more  or  less  for  several  months  till  in  the  following  year 
hostilities  finished  by  the  surrender  of  Montreal.  Its  capitulation  took  place  Sep- 
tember 9th,  1760,  just  one  year  after  the  Battle  of  the  Plains  of  Abraham.  J5y  the 
terms  of  this  ca])itulation,  signed  both  by  (lenerals  Amherst  and  de  Vaudreuil,  pro- 
tection was  promised  to  the  inhabitants.  'I'hc  free  use  of  their  Religion.  Laws  and 
Language  was  also  guaranteed  them.  This  was.  however,  only  till  the  treaty  of 
peace  was  signed.  This  was  done  between  France  and  England  at  Paris,  l"'eb.  10th. 
1764.  This  treaty  confirmed  generally  those  articles  of  capitulation  at  Quebec  and 
Montreal  which  related  to  the  French  inhabilaius  of  Canada,  arid  ihey  thus  became 
legally  as  much  subjects  of  tiie  Crown  of  Great  ISritain  as  the  inhabitants  of  L'eland 
or  Wales.  During  the  interval  between  the  capitulation  of  Montreal  and  its  receiv- 
ing warrant  to  hold  ()uarter  Sessions,  that  is,  from  the  fall  C)f  Montreal  in  1760  to 
1764,  Canada  was  held  in  occupation  by  the  iirilish  troops.  Ceneral  Gage  com- 
manded in  &gt;[ontreal.  General  Murray  was  chief.  Councils  sitting  in  (Quebec,  Three 
Rivers  and  Montreal  regulated  the  affairs  of  the  couiUry.  They  were  composed 
entirely  of  military  oflicers.  'J'his  govermnent  at  last  gave  way  to  that  granted  by 
General  Murray. 

In  October  of  176;^,  an  imi)ortant  proclamation  was  issued  in  the  name  of 
"  George  III,  King  of  I-aigland  ;  "  officers  and  men  in  it  were  offered  free  grants  of 
land  in  Canada,  and  "all  jjcrsons  resorting  to  the  said  colonies  might  confide  in  Mis 
Majesty's  royal  proteciion  for  enjoying  the  benefit  of  the  laws  of  England."  More 
than  400  Protestants  of  Jiritish  origin  now  became  residents  in  Canada — the  French 
])opulation  of  the  province  being  a  little  over  75.000.  In  November,  1763.  the 
military  form  of  Government  was  brought  to  an  end  by  the  ap[)ointment  of  General 
Murray  to  the  office  of  Ciovernor-General.  His  instructions  were  as  far  as  i)ossible 
to  introduce  the  laws  of  England.  Another  thing  recjuired  was  that  the  inhabitants 
should  comply  with  these  conditions,  viz.  :  "  'l\)  take  the  oath  of  allegiance,  to  make 
a  declaration  of  abjuration  and  to  give  up  all  arms  in  their  possession."  It  was 
found  impossible  to  procure  compliance  with  these  orders,  and  the  (ieneral  modified 
them  as  much  as  possible.  The  oath  of  abjuration  could  not  be  taken  by  the  Roman 
Catholics,  as  it  involved  a  fundamental  principle  of  their  Religion,  and  therefore  no 
Roman  Catholic  was  sworn  in  as  Justice  of  the  Peace ;  that  about  arms  was 
extremely  distasteful ;  whilst  that  of  allegiance  to  the  English  throne  was  taken 
readily  and  cheerfully.  It  took  a  little  over  a  year  to  regulate  all  these  matters,  and 
on  the  nth  of  January,  1764,  letters  patent   under  the  Great  Seal  of  the  Province

■j'lie  first  instance  of  ••  felony '' is  adjudicated  on  in  the  ^^ay  met;iing  of  the' 
Court.  i7'i5.  It  was  a  case  of  a  man  and  liis  wife,  with  a  negro,  stealing  different 
articles.  It  is  ihus  rec(MLled  :  •'Sentence  of  A\'i]liani  and  Flnior  March,  and  (ieorge 
the  N'agre."  '"  'I  ney  are  to  go  luck  lo  the  place  of  their  confinement,  tiie  said  W'll-

instance  of  a  man  and  woman  being  flogged.  Fli/.abeth  Upt(^n  is  also  condemned  by 
the  same  Court  for  felony  ;  "  I'hat  she  go  back  to  the  prison  and  there  receive  25 
strijies,  ,ind  then  be  dischargeil." 

On  the  next  ojiening  of  the  Court,  July  22iid,  1765,  the  names  of  the  Justices 
are  Jn.  Dumas,  Daniel  Robertson  and  Isaac  Todd.  It  seems  tluit  our  friend  "die 
N'agre"  either  didn't  think  much  of  his  50  lashes  received  three  months  previousl\  — 
or  dial  the  cuticle  of  liis  back  like  his  skull  was  so  thick  as  to  defy  "  the  cat."  We 
find  him  at  this  Court  again  a  prisoner  for  stealing  '•  two  pieces  of  silk  ribjion." 
Knowing  there  was  no  use  of  prevarication,  as  a  witness  swore  dead  against  him,  he 
acknowledged  his  crime  and  pleaded  guilty.  This  is  the  sentence  which  he  received  : 
I  hat  the  said  Ceorge,  between  the  hours  of  9  and  10  o'clock  on  the  forenoon  of 
Tuesday  the  22nd  August,  be  stript  naked  to  the  waist,  and  tied  at  a  cart  tail  at  the 
gaol,  and  then  to  receive  10  stripes,  and  at  iMr.  Dechambaux's  corner  10  stripes,  and 
the  Pt.  Street  this  side  the  GeneraPs  10  stripes,  and  at  Mr.  Landruve'a  corner  10 
stripes,  and  proceed  to  the  Court  cinner  and  then  receive  10  stripes,  and  on  the 
I'arade  10  stripes."  Pet  us  sum  up  this  sentence  :  Six  times  in  his  march  he  had  lo 
stop  and  receive  each  time  10  stripes  on  his  naked  back  with  the  cat  of  nine  taiks. 


16  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL, 

August  2nd,  1765.  In  this  sitting  of  thu  Court  a  Frenchwoman  named  Margaret 
Tourangeau,  for  stealing  ''  a  iiiece  of  camblet,"  is  sent  down  to  be  "  set  for  one 
hour  in  the  stocks."  Tliis  is  the  first  instance  of  these  Old  Country  instruments  of 
punishment  being  mentioned  and  used  in  Montreal.  They  were  in  commcn  use  in 
the  IS'ew  England  colonies. 

Among  the  first  regulations  is  that  of  the  bakers,  in  which  the  while  loaf  is 
called  'a  brick,''  ..nd  sold  at  S  coppers  of  4  lbs.  weight  and  the  brown  o(  6  lbs.  at 
lo  copi^ers.  AniJther,  and  this  shows  there  were  slaves  in  Montreal  in  those  clays, 
who  were  bought  and  sold  like  oilier  merchandise,  'i'he  rule  was,  "  \o  tavern,  ale- 
house or  innkeeper  do  receive,  harbor  or  entertain  any  bond  or  servant  slave  or 
slaves  drinking,  gaming  or  loitering  in  their  houses,  under  a  iienally  of  ^5."  Two 
years  and  a  half  before  this,  on  .&gt;4lh  May,  1764,  the  first  ])aper  had  lieen  published  and 
printed  in  ()uebec.  This  was  called  the  (Quebec  Gazette,  and  like  its  official  name- 
sake of  to-day  was  printed  in  two  columns, — one  French,  the  other  Knglish. 

In  the  first  copy  of  this  ])aper  there  is  found  a  reference  in  the  Ilovie Neix-s  10 
the  New  England  States,  and  it  '"hoi'es  that  the  news  brought  out  by  the  last  shi]i 
is  not  true,"  of  taxing  those  colonies  for  some  of  the  expense  incurred  by  Cireat 
Britain  in  their  defence,  especially  the  wars  between  the  British  Colonies  and  the 
French  and  Indians  of  Canada.  Twelve  years  after,  in  1776,  the  troubles  culmin- 
ated 111  the  separation  of  these  colonies  into  the  13  United  States. 

If  Moses  Ha/en,  John  Burke,  Thos,  Walker  or  any  others  of  llicse  old  Justices 
of  the  Peace  were  alive  to-day,  after  the  space  of  130  years,  they  would  indeed  fail  to 
recognize  the  present  Montreal  of  A.  D.  rSyi.  An  old  Quebecer  suddenly  apjiearing 
in  the  Ancient  Cajjital  would  not  be  quite  so  bewildered,  'inhere  would  be  the  natural 
features,  the  grand  old  heights  and  the  noble  river  [lowing  past — the  old  fi)rt,  "  Plains  " 
and  ancient  buildings  which  he  would  remember  ;  but  the  old  Montrealer  would  look 
with  astonishment  at  tlie  grand  advance  which  his  city  has  made  in  a  hundred  years, 
notwithstanding  all  it  disadvantages  of  being  700  miles  from  the  ocean  and  icebound 
in  its  river  for  months  every  year.  The  great  energy  of  its  new  inhabitants  has  obliter- 
ated almost  every  feature  and  relic  of  the  past,  and  it  can  now  hold  ils  head  high  up 
among  the  largest  cities  of  North  America.  Indeed,  Montreal  by  the  laicst  census  of 
the  United  States  and  Canada  is  now  the  7th  hi.rgest  city  on  this  Continent.  Slie  was  by 
official  records  in  the  year  1.S61  tlie  loth  city  in  the  listuf  American  cities,  n(yw  she  is  the 
7th  ;  what  she  will  be  by  the  energy  and  jiush  of  her  merchants  in  50  years  hence  our 
children  will  see.  But,  in  the  days  we  write  of.  the  site  of  old  "  Ville  Marie  "  was  very 
much  the  shape  of  a  parallelogram.  Of  course  St.  Paul  street  and  the  river  beach 
formed  one  of  the  longer  sides, — we  might  call  it  the  front  side.  The  opposite  side,  or 
the  rear,  as  it  may  be  called,  was  Craig  street  ;  the  western  boundary  extended  from 
the  foot  of  McCill  street  to  Craig  street,  and  the  eastern  from  the  old  Quebec  barracks 
to  the  same  street,  Craig.  East  and  west  were  strong  fortification  walls,  4  feet  thick. 
These  extended  some  distance  along  Craig  street,  and  there  is  yet  a  narrow  lane  run- 
ning between  St.  James  street  and  Craig,  called  Fortification  lane. 


HISIORY  OF  MONTREAL.  *    17 


At  tlie  conquest  in  1759,  tlie  principal  buildings  of  the  town  included  the  Palace 
of  the  Governor-General,  who  was  then  M.  de  Vaudreuil,  near  the  foot  of  Jacques  Car- 
tier  square  and  the  house  of  M.  de  Longueuil,  at  the  western  end  of  St.  Mary  street. 
Probably  the  total  area  of  the  town  did  not  exceed  100  acres.  When  the  establishment 
of  English  rule  was  perfected  by  the  Treaty  of  Paris,  in  February,  1764,  then  a  strong 
tide  of  emigration  set  in  towards  Canada,  and  in  U\c  persons  who  arrived  the  bad  was 
mixed  with  the  good.  It  is  remarkable  that  in  the  records  of  the  (^ourt  of  Quarter 
Sessions  for  years  aft^r  the  conquest  of  the  country  in  Montreal  there  are  very  few 
French  names  before  the  magistrates  for  those  crimes  for  which  punishment  by  whi[)- 
ping,  the  stocks  or  the  pillory  or  branding  on  the  hand  was  nicted  out.  This  shows 
how  thoroughly  they  obeyed  their  cur6s  to  respect  the  laws  and  be  faithful  in  their  alle- 
giance; and  though  after  this  many  emissaries  from  the  colonies  (among  whom  was 
the  great  Benjamin  Franklin  himself)  tried  to  allure  them,  they  remained  firm. 

This  emigration  largely  increased  the  population  of  Montreal.  St.  Paul  street 
became  the  chief  emporium  for  business.  All  beyond  Craig  street  to  the  foot  of  the 
Mountain  and  to  the  east  and  west,  including  i)ortions  of  St.  Lawrence,  St.  Mary's 
and  St.  Antoine  or  Anthony  wards,  were  green  fields,  varied  occasionally  by  swamps, 
woods,  and  underbrush.  Those  present  populous  adjuncts  of  the  city,  Quebec 
suburbs  and  Griffiatown,  presented  a  very  desolate  appearance.  There  were  the 
chapel  and  convent  of  the  Sisters  of  the  Congregation,  the  old  Recollet  Church,  the 
Grey  Nuns  and  the  Parish  Church.  Tiiere  was  not  a  single  Protestant  church  or 
school  in  the  place. 

Two  dreadful  fires  visited  Montreal  at  this  period  of  its  I.Istory.  On  Saturday, 
iSth  May,  1765,  a  fire  broke  out,  and  within  a  few  hours  destroyed  108  houses  and 
reduced  215  families  to  the  greatest  distress.  A  very  interesting  pamphlet,  drawn  up 
by  a  benevolent  individual,  was  printed  in  London  on  this  occasion,  and  circulated 
freely  in  behalf  of  the  sufferers.  A  large  sum  was  thus  raised  in  England  and  for- 
warded to  Montreal  in  aid  of  those  who  had  been  burnt  out.  The  population,  at 
this  time,  of  Montreal  was  about  7000,  and  according  to  an  oflicial  list  of  this  year 
there  were  136  Protestants.  In  the  year  189 1  there  were  about  80,000  Protestants 
in  Montreal,  a  steady  increase  from  the  136  in  the  year  1765.  On  the  nth  of  April, 
1768,  another  fire  broke  out  in  the  stable  of  one  of  the  sufferers  of  the  last  fire,  and 
raged  with  ungovernable  fury  for  hours,  when  ninety  houses,  two  churches  and  a  large 
school  were  consumed.  The  number  who  suffered  was  great,  many  of  them  having 
been  burned  out  at  the  fire  of  1765,  only  three  years  before. 

Governor  Carleton,  of  date  25th  November,  1767,  thus  says,  speaking  of  Quebec 
and  Montreal :  "The  town  of  Quebec  is  the  only  port  in  this  province  that  has  the 
least  claim  to  be  called  a  fortified  place,  for  the  flimsy  wall  about  Montreal,  was  it 
not  falling  to  ruins,  could  only  turn  musketry."  He  then  writes  about  both  the 
French  inhabitants  and  the  new  subjects  since  the  Cession  r  "  The  Europeans  who 
migrate  never  will  prefer  the  long,  inhospitable  winters  of  Canada  to  the  more  cheer- 
ful climate  and  more  fruitful  soil  of  His  Majesty's  southern  provinces.     The  few  old

subjects  at  ))rcscnt  in  this  province  iiavc  been  mostly  left  here  by  accident,  and  are 
cillier  disbanded  officers,  soldiers  and  followers  of  the  army,  who,  not  knowing  how 
to  dispose  of  themselves  elsewhere,  settled  where  they  wore  left  at  the  reduction — 
or  else  they  are  adventurers  in  trade,  or  such  as  could  not  remain  at  home,  who  set 
out  to  mend  their  fortune  at  the  opening  of  this  new  channel  for  commerce.  But 
experience  has  taught  almost  all  of  them  that  this  trade  requires  a  strict  frugality  they 
are  all  strangers  to,  or  to  which  they  will  not  submit.  But  while  this  severe  climate 
and  the  poverty  of  the  country  discourages  all  but  the  natives,  its  healthfulness  is 
such  that  these  multiply  daily,  so  that  this  country  must  to  the  end  of  time  be  peojjlcd 
by  a  Canadian  race,  who  have  already  taken  such  firm  root  and  got  to  so  great  a 
height,  that  any  new  stock  transplanted  will  be  totally  void  and  imperceptible  among 
them,  except  in  the  towns  of  Quebec  and  Montreal."  Of  this  prophecy  of  General 
Carleton,  the  fulfilment  has  shown  it  to  be  perfectly  true.  If  we  except  the  Eastern 
Townships,  settled  greatly  by  U.  E.  Loyalists,  and  those  counties  settled  by  Scotch 
and  English  emigrants  and  officers  and  men  after  the  war  of  1812-13,  there  is  hardly 
a  county  now  in  Lower  Canada  where  his  words  are  not  verified. 

In  the  general  Sessions  of  October,  1768,  one  of  those  disgraceful  acts  was  per- 
formed which  was  a  shame  in  any  Christian  country  to  tolerate.  In  the  case  of  the 
King  vs-  Anne  Laneford  for  "  larceny,"  she  is  found  guilty,  and  her  sentence,  carried 
out,  was  as  follows  :  Knowing  the  nature  of  her  punishment,  "  she  had  put  herself  on 
her  country,"  but  nevertheless  received  the  following  punishment :  "  She  is  to  be  tied 
to  a  cart's  tail,  and  conducted,  naked  to  the  waist,  to  Quebec  Gate,  where  she  is  to 
jeceive  5  lashes,  as  also  5  lashes  at  the  Old  Chapellc,  5  lashes  at  the  Chateau,  5  lashes 
at  Landrunc's  Corner,  10  lashes  at  the  Market  Place  and  5  lashes  at  the  corner  of 
the  Court  House,  and  she  is  then  to  be  discharged  on  paying  her  fees." 

In  the  January  Sessions  of  1769,  a  Erenchman  of  the  name  of  Pierre  Girard  is 
arraigned  for  stealing  flour  and  wheat.  The  jury  find  him  not  guilty,  and  add  :  "  He  is 
a  perfect,  honest  man" — a  high  eulogium  to  be  given  on  one  who  ten  years  just  before 
belonged  to  the  J^rench  colony  of  Canada.  At  the  same  Court  the  first  example  of 
any  one  being  put  in  the  pillory  is  recorded.  L.  Beauvais  (this  time  the  culi)rit  is  a 
Frenchman)  iscondemned  "  to  stand  there  from  nine  to  eleven  o'clock, "and  it  adds, "  for 
three  market  days."  This  sentence  seems  small  enough  on  paper,  but  terrible  in  fact 
even  for  one  day  only.  Let  me  explain  what  these  jjunishments — //le  stocks  and  the 
pillory — mean.  We  read  of  the  Apostles  St.  Paul  and  St.  Silas  in  the  gaol  of  Phil- 
ippi  having  their  feet  "  made  fast  in  the  stocks."  Also  King  David  says  of  Joseph, 
"  whose  feet  they  hurt  in  the  stocks."  It  consisted  of  a  machine  of  two  pieces  of 
timber  with  cut  out  half  circular  holes  in  each  board,  which  when  brought  to  stand 
one  upon  another  narrow-wise  formed  two  complete  hoi'  s,  into  which  the  ankles  of 
the  i)risoners  were  placed,  the  two  pieces  being  firmly  locked  together.  The  i)illory 
was  a  senseless  and  useless  punishment.  It  consisted  of  a  frame  of  wood  erected  on 
■posts  with  movable  boards  and  holes,  through  which  holes  they  put  the  head  and 
hands  of  the  criminal  for  punishment,  the  machine  turn  ng  on  a  pivot  and  in  a  circle. 
It  was  inflicted  near  the  market  place  of  the  old  city  on  the  prison  ground  and  near

tliis  rentuiy  had  passed )  al  Xelson's  Mmnnnenl.  the  culpiil  faciii-  the  ri\er  and  Don-

wrctcli  wlieelcd  around  to  faee  tlie  ^[oniimcnt  and  save  lnni&gt;elf  from  tlie  shower  of 
rotten  etri^s  and  mud  used  it  and  made  tlie  culprit  turn  round  aL^ain  on  the  movable 
pivot  of  the  pilloiy.  After  an  hour  or  two  standing  thus  in  sucli  a  constrained 
position,  sometimes  the  effect  was  disastrous,  and  peoi)le  suffered  loni,'  afterwards 
from  it.  The  first  Frenchman  publicly  whipped  was  condemned  by  this  (^mit.  Ueiny 
guilty  of  larceny,  he  received  the  same  i)unislinicnt  ns  the  Englishman  mentioned 
before,  only  his  number  of  stripes  \vas  thirty-five  divided  at  the  same  points  in  the 
public  march  and  tied  to  the  cart's  t.iil. 

In  the  August  term  of  1769,  there  is  given  a  long  list  of  twenty-four  bakers  of 
the  town  md  environs,  but  there  is  not  one  I'aiglish  name,  so  that  the  iniiabitants 
were  entirely  deiKUulent  on  the  French  "  boulangers  "  for  their  daily  breail.  I'he 
4-lb.  white  loaf  an.d  the  6-lt).  brown  were  ])oth  sold  for  twelve  sols  at  this  time. 

In  the  Court  of  June,  1772,  are  the  following  names,  showing  how  the  new  emi- 
grants were  pushing   their  way  in   the  new  colony  :    John  Sunderland,  Peter  Arnoldi, 
Ilugli  Fanes,  Jas.  Perry,  Thomas  JUisby,  Peter  Forbes,  John  Iiorne,  Duncan  Camp- 
bell, Wm.  Murray,    John  Trotter,    Allan  McF'arlane.  \Vm.  McClements   and  William 
INIcKay.     For  the  second  time  only  (in  this  Court)  \vc  come  upon  the  reports   being 
written  in  the  I'"rench  language.     Tlie  two  justices  wlio  held  this  Court  were  French- 
Swiss  Huguenots,  viz.,  John  Marteilke  and  John  Dumas.     At  the  General  Sessions 
of  Sei)tember,  1775,  John  Smith  has  four  indictments  brought  against  him  for  larceny. 
He  is  found  to  be  guilty  of  all,  but  sentence  is  suspended  until  next  term.     It  seems 
the  next  term  was  never  recorded.     The  Court  did  not  open  again  till  January,  1779. 
During  these  next  three  years  the  inhabitants  of  Montreal  had  much  to  do  to  show 
their  fidelity  to  their  new  king,   and  their  ajiproval  of  the  way  the  British  had  gov- 
erned since  1 760.     All  available  men  were  now  required  for  the  defence  of  the  country. 
Among  the  New  Englanders  things  had  been  getting,   in   relation  to  Great  Britain, 
from  bad  to  worse.     We  all  know  that  on  July  4,  1776,  the  Declaration  of  Inde- 
pendence severed  these  thirteen  States  for  ever  from  England   and  made  a  new 
nation,  destined  to  become  one  of  the  most  progressive  and  remarkable  of  the  earth. 
This  was  a  memorable  year  in  Montreal.     The  new  act,  called  the  "  Quebec  Act," 
was  to  come  into  force  on   ist  May,  but  the   events  which  ensued   prevented   the 
assembling  of  a  new  Council  till  the  year  1777.     During  this   year  the  colonists  of 
the   New  England  States  refused  to  pay  the  reve.iue  taxes  laid  on   them   by    the 
Mother  Country.     It  was  first  a  rebellion,  and  in  July,   1776,  they  declared  them- 
selves no  longer  subjects   of  the  King,  but  free  and  independent  States.     Having 
declared    rebellion,   the  war   with  Britain  and  her  colony,  Canada,  began  early  in 
J^'ly&gt;  ^775-     The  Americans  determined  to  take  Canada,  and  for  this  purpose  they 
sent  two  armies  towards  the  North.     In  connection  with   this  movement  General 
Montgomery    had    detached  Col.    Ethan    Allen    with  150   men    from    the  main

army  to  attack  NFoiitrcal.  On  the  24th  October,  1775,  ho  ciosscd  the  St. 
J.awrciice  three  miles  l)elo\v  the  ciiy,  at  Loiimie  Poiiile.  No  sooner  did  (len- 
eral  Carlton  know  of  it  than  he  asseml)led  30  regnlars  and  about  200  militia, 
I''rench  and  English,  of  the  town,  and  put  them  under  the  command  of  Major 
Garden,  who.  early  next  day,  marched  down  to  Longue  Pointo  and  encountered  the 
enemy.  The  Americans  had  jjossessed  themselves  ot"  some  houses  and  barns.  An 
engagement  took  ])lace  which  histed  half  an  hour,  when  the  colonists  under  Allen 
were  coinjjletely  defeated,  and  he  and  his  whole  command  were  taken  prisoners  of 
war.  Afterwards  tlu'y  wire  all  liberated  when  their  main  army  under  Montgomery  took 
Montna.l.  'I'he  American  armies  were  conniianded  respectively  by  Montgomery  and 
Arnold  as  their  generals.  'I'lu'y  first  t()(&gt;k  the  I'oute  of  Lake  Chanii)lain  and  the  Richelieu 
Rivei-,  capturing  all  the  fortified  places  011  their  way.  as  St.  Johns.  Cluinibly  and  Sorel. 
AtSorel,  Montgomery  jilaced  heavy  batteries  to  prevent  any  comra.nicalion  between 
(Quebec  aiul  Montreal  ;  and  as  soon  as  he  marched  to  take  the  latter  jjlace.  (lov- 
ernor  Carlton  was  obliged  to  escape  to  Quebec,  which  he  reached  under  the  skilful 
guidance  of  Captain  JJouchette  and  his  aide-de-camji,  Chas.  Del.anaudiere. 

Tlie  .Americans  took  Montreal  and  entered  the  city  on  the  13th  Novendjer,  1775, 
and  finding  abundance  of  tine  liiick  woollen  cloth.  .\[ontgomery  clad  all  his  troops 
in  tliis  C'anadian  stuff.  'I'hey  did  not  remain  long  in  the  city,  but  set  out  for  Quebec, 
which  was  reached  on  the  5th  day  of  December,  1775.  An  act  of  heroism  and  i)atri- 
otism  occurred  at  this  time  well  worthy  of  being  noticed  here.  It  was  necessary  to 
communicate  with  the  General  at  Quebec  from  NFontreal  ;  but  by  the  strict  watch  of 
the  Americans  at  Sorel  it  was  impossible  now  to  ])ass  by  the  River  St.  Lawrence. 
In  the  exigencies  of  the  case,  a  French  Canadian  stepped  forward  and  volunteered 
for  the  office.  It  has  been  attributed  to  Mr.  Papineau,  father  of  the  Honorable 
Joseph  Papineau.  'I'he  letter  was  written  and  enclosed  in  a  walking  staff,  and  the 
brave  man,  equip]")ed  as  a  ])cddler,  set  ()Ut  on  his  perilous  route.  Leaving  Montreal, 
he  passed  over  to  Longucuii,  and  travelled  on  slowly  as  a  peddler  to  Sorel.  Arrived 
there,  he  saw  the  American  army,  which  was  stationed  there  to  protect  the  larger 
body  soon  to  be  on  its  way  from  Montreal  to  attack  Quebec.  Mixing  with  the 
soldiers,  he  sold  various  things  and  learned  ^nuch  that  was  useful.  Pretending  to 
sympathize  with  them  against  the  Pritish,  he  was  unrestrained  and  permitted  to  gO 
on  his  way,  as  he  said,  to  the  next  village.  When  some  miles  from  Sorel  he  left  off 
his  disguise,  and\engaging  swift  horses  never  slackened  reins  nor  speed,  till,  carrying 
the  dreadful  news  before  him  and  warning  the  people  of  the  approach  of  the  Amer- 
ican army,  he  arrived  at  Quebec,  and  the  news  of  the  capture  of  Montreal  was  the 
means  of  so  strengthening  Quebec  that  it  resulted  in  the  death  of  Montgomery  and 
retreat  of  his  army.  Followed  by  the  British  Army,  tliey  abandoned  Sorel,  Chambly, 
St.  Johnii  and  of  course  Montreal.  During  the  year  1775  the  Americans  were  con- 
tinually attempting  to  entice  the  French  Canadian  population  to  join  in  their 
revolt,  but  the  more  the  Canadians  saw  of  them,  and*  especially  after  their  taking  and 
plundering  the  city  of    Montreal,    the  less    they   liked    them.      They  could  not

forgcl  their  massacres  in  former  years  when  these  Colonists  willi  their  Inth'an  Iroquois 
desolated  their  country  anil  homes.  They  had  prospered  iii'the  fifieen  years  of  15riti^•h 
rule,  and  they  knew  what  war  and  its  accompaniments  meant,  'i'luis  they  remained 
loyal  to  the  JJritish  Throne  and  Constitution. 

'i"he  Philadelphia  Congress,  which  had  decided  on  Independence,  determined  to 
send  a  deputation  to  Canada  ;  and  Dr.  IJenjamin  I'"rankliii.  of  world  renown,  and 
others  formed  that  deputation.  None  knew  better  than  I'ranklin  the  powers  of  the 
Press  in  any  cause,  and  therefore  he  suizgested,  and  it  was  acti-d  on.  bringing  into 
Canada  a  printing  i)re;.s.  so  tliat  by  manifestoes,  circidars  and  such  like  ]iapers 
sj)read  broadcast  among  the  inhabitants,  they  would  know  the  f)bjects  of  ihcir  mission 
and  the  advantages  of  annexation  lo  the  levolled  colonies.  As  an  attache  of  the  depu- 
tation sent  on  to  follow  Montgomery's  army  we  find  one  named  Mesplet.  I'ranklin 
composed  the  matter  f)f  these  circulars  and  Mes])lel  did  the  mechanical  work,  but  it 
all  signally  failed.  I'ranklin  and  the  rest  of  the  dejuitatidii  returned  to  the  Slates  ; 
Mesplet,  however,  remainetl  in  Montreal  and  continued  the  printing  office  in  Custom 
House  .S(piare,  and  subsetpienlly  issued  a  four-paged  eight-column  weeklv  iicwspajier, 
and  called  it  the  Gazette.  It  is  the  pioneer  of  all  our  I'jiglish  papers  in  Canada 
proper,  and  is  still  continued  to  this  day  in  the  Gazette  of  Montreal.  The  Halifax 
Recorder  was  earlier  than  the  Gazette,  ■\'r,  it  was  published  in  1769,  but  the  very  first 
newspaper  in  Ihitish  North  America  was  the  (Quebec  6'&lt;?3t'/'/^,  pul)]islud  in  Ma\, 
1764.  a  very  small  sheet  in  two  columns — I'"rench  and  iMiglish — but  miu  h  appre- 
ciated by  the  inhabitants.  Mes])let,  however,  must,  after  this,  have  been  of  a  rather 
plotting  character,  as  we  find  on  August  24th,  1778,  a  public  notice,  "  that  th.e  order 
to  com|)el  K.  Mesplet,  jirinter,  to  quit  the  Province  is  suspended  on  certain  con- 
ditions." 

\w  connection  wiih  llie  tami)ering  with  the  loyalty  of  the  Canadians  at  this 
time,  the  following  incident  may  be  mentioned  to  show  how  far  some  people  will  go 
to  try  and  accomplish  their  ends.  There  was  at  this  time  a  fine  bust  of  His  Majesty, 
George  Hi,  erected  in  the  Place  d'Armes  Scpiare.  Ivirly  in  tin;  year  1775  or  at 
the  close  of  1774,  one  morning  this  said  bust  was  found  all  daubed  and  dirtied  witli 
tarrv  paint,  a  chaplet  of  potatoes  was  placed  on  it,  and  on  the  breast  was  a  notice 
which   read  thus  :  "  Behold  the  Pope  of  Canada  and  the  I'nghsh  Sot." 

Although  the  Governor  offered  a  large  reward  for  llie  perpetrators  of  tliis  insult 
to  His  Majesty,  it  was  never  found  out,  but  some  one  of  the  Americans  then  in 
Montreal  was  suspected  with  good  reason  of  being  the  culprit.  The  bust  was  removed, 
but  the  stand  still  remained.  The  head  of  this  bust  is  now,  I  am -informed  by  Hon- 
orable Judge  Baby, — than  whom  none  is  more  competent — to  be  seen  on  a  j)laster 
bust  in  the  rooms  of  the  Montreal  Natural  History  Society,  of  which  the  judge  is  the 
presiding  genius,  and  who  has  given  me  some  valuable  notes  on  Montreal,  which  arc 
inserted  in  this  history.  This  is  recorded  in  the  records  of  the  Court,  January,  1790, 
in  the  presentment  of  the  Grand  Jury,  where  tliey  say  :  "That  the  building  situated 
upon  the  Place  d'Armes   under  which   His  Majesty's  bust  was   formerly  placed  is  a 


22  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL. 

public  nuisance,  and  ought  to  l)e  pulled  down."  'J'he  Court  granted  the  request,  and 
*•  orders  that  the  same  be  pulled  dcnvn  accordingly."  It  had  remained  for  fifteen 
years  after  the  insult  to  the  ICing  and  seven  years  after  the  fuial  independence  of  the 
colonies  of  America. 

AVe  can  well  understand  after  all  that  has  been  written,  that  in  these  stirring 
times  they  hadnoojiportunity  of  solemnly  opening  the  ("icneral  Se.i.;ions  in  the  name 
of  His  Majesty,  when  King  George's  foes  had  taken  the  city.  We  can  see,  too, 
that  even  after  they  had  left  Canada  in  the  autumn  of  1776,  and  how  every 
available  man  was  needed  for  Home  defence  and  Volunteer  duty,  that  these  courts 
for  the  trial  of  petty  misdemeanors  would  be  unopened  till  more  quiet  times  arrived. 
There  is  one  thing,  however,  that  we  find  when  the  courts  were  in  full  working  order 
again,  that  many  French  names,  the  descendants  of  wnorn  are  now  well-known  citi- 
zens, or  have  been  of  ^Montreal,  must  have  taken  sonic  kind  of  oath  of  office,  as  many 
of  them  are  nominated  as  Justices  of  the  Peace  and  sit  hereafter  as  Magistrates  in 
the  Cicneral  (Quarter  Sessions. 

It  may  be  inleresling  at  this  point  of  our  history  to  divert  a  little  to  the  social 
manners,  customs  and  condition  of  the  inhabitants  of  Montreal  fr  )m  the  Cession  of 
the  rrovince  to  the  close  of  the  eighteenth  century.  As  we  read  that  the  King  of 
iM-ance,  in  the  years  between  1650  and  1660,  procured  wives  for  his  colonists,  so, 
after  the  disbanding  of  the  army,  many  of  the  officers  and  soldiers  married  women 
of  the  country,  and  thus  were  intermixed  the  Knglish  Old  Country  names  and  the 
Trench  manners  and  religion,  which  we  find  in  certain  parts  of  Quebec  Prcnince  at 
this  very  day. 

Every  ship  which  sailed  to  Canada,  that  is,  to  Quebec,  during  1650  and  some 
following  years,  was  recpiired  to  carry  out  a  certain  number  of  young  men  called 
"  engages,"  who  afterwards  procured  land,  and  then  wanted  wives.  To  furnish  such, 
young  women  of  good  character  were  brought  out  under  the  auspices  of  religious 
jiersons  of  their  own  se.\.  Thc}'  were  at  first  selected  from  amc&gt;ngst  the  orphan  girls 
who  were  brought  up  in  the  Oeneral  Hospital  in  Paris,  at  the  expense  of  the  King. 
From  these  circumstances  they  were  called  "  King's  Daughters."  Afterwards 
])ersons  of  stronger  constitutions  were  chosen  from  the  cotmtry  jiarishes,  and  thus 
many  of  the  present  families  of  Quebec  Province  received  their  lirst  progenitors.  It 
is  interesting  to  read  records  of  the  first  marriages  and  baptisms  during  these  years, 
after  l''rench  and  l-aiglish  had  both  sworn  allegiance  to  (leorge  III. 

Rev.  Dr.  Cami)bell,  in  his  interesting  volume  on  "Old  St.  Gabriel  Church," 
from  which  I  have  received  a  vast  amountof  information  regarding  the  old  families 
of  Montreal,  tells  us  that  Rev.  Dr.  Dclisle  was  "the  first  Protestant  minister  resident 
in  Montreal  ; "  and  then  he  adds  this  information,  which  may  be  the  true  meaning  of 
"  Swiss  "  as  applied  to  a  l*"rench  Protestant :  "  The  advent  into  Canada  of  )""rench 
Protestants,  as  representatives  of  the  Church  of  Kngland,  was  in  pursuance  of  the 
policy  of  the  IJritish  authorities,  who  hojied  and  expected,  by  means  of  clergymen 
sjjeaking  their  own  language,  to  convert  the  Frcncii  Canadians  to  Protestantism,  and 


HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL.  23 

thereby  secure  Uieir  loyalty  to  England.  This  hope  of  winning  tlie  habitants  W.  the 
faith  of  the  Church  of  J''.ngland  was  doomed  to  disai)pointment,  and  after  a  fifty  years' 
trial  it  was  entirely  abandoned." 

Diirnig  the  years  1775  and  1776,  the  inhabitants  of  Montreal  experienced  many 
changes  and  vicissitudes.  Xo  doubt  to  some  of  the  French  pojjulation  it  Iiad  at  first 
been  galling  to  be  under  the  Union  Jack  instead  of  the  lilies  of  France,  but  the  fifteen 
years  of  IJritish  rule  had  greatly  changed  .heir  opinion.  They  had  better  markets, 
better  crops  in  these  days  of  peace,  and  seruier  privileges  every  way,  and  now  to  be 
subjected  to  the  sway  of  the  New  England  colonist  was  indeed  worse  than  ever. 
Toy  spread  over  the  City  when  the  last  of  the  invading  American  army  passed  .St, 
Johns  on  their  retreat  to  their  own  country.  It  was  a  busy  time,  not  only  in  Mon- 
treal, but  in  the  Fort  of  Ciiambly,  which  was  then  the  principal  station  of  JJrilish 
troops  and  munitions  of  war  during  the  continuance  of  the  struggle  between  the 
^Mother  Country  and  her  revolted  colonies.  'I'roops  were  arriving  and  troops  dejiarf 
ing — for  preparations  were  being  made  to  follow  up  the  retreating  Americans  under 
General  Arnold,  from  Quebec,  and  invade  their  country.  In  all  these  struggles,  up  to 
the  close  nearly  of  the  fratricidal  war,  Vermont  was  always  co([uelting  to  remain 
faithful  to  England  and  join  Canada,  and  we  find  in  the  archives  of  that  period  various 
letters  and  documents  from  different  individuals  relating  to  this  subject.  At  las 
"Tile  Green  Mountain  Boys"  threw  in  their  allegiance  with  their  countrymen  and 
joined  the  Republic.  In  a  letter  from  Governor  Chittenden  to  General  llalde. 
mand,  we  find  him  slating  :  '•  That  the  i)eople  (jf  Vermont  are  waiting  for  a  free 
trade  with  Canada."  "  They  consider  themselves  unconnected  with  any  power,  and 
by  natural  situation  inclined  to  this  province  (Canada)  for  commerce."  This  was 
written  in  July,  1784,  just  when  the  war  finished  and  before  the  \'ermonters  finally 
j(;ined  the  Union.  Previous  to  this,  in  1782,  Ethan  Allen  had  written  to  the  Gover- 
nor that  "Congress  had  refused  to  admit  Vermont," — this  had  "stirred  up  the 
common  people  against  the  Confederacy."  He  says  that  "  he  believes  a  vote  to  con- 
tinue the  British  connection  would  be  carried,  and  will  do  all  in  his  power  to  render 
the  .State  a  Jjrilish  Province."  Washington  threatened  in  July,  1783,  that  if''Vei- 
mont  were  not  (juiet  he  would  move  his  whole  force  into  the  State," 

(Jn  the  24th  July,  1776,  the  distribution  of  troops  and  the  order  of  march  were 
issued  in  general  orders.  ()uite  a  number  of  recruits  had  joined  the  regulars,  and 
the  Volunteers  and  .Militia  were  daily  drilling  in  Montreal.  All  the  recruits  at  Chambly 
were  drafted  into  the  47th  and  53rd  Kegiinenls,  and  two  companies  of  the  2rst  set 
out  on  the  march  to  St.  Johns.  On  the  26th  a  seige.uu's  parly  were  ordered  to  look 
after  "rebel  (that  is,  American)  skulkers,"  who  were  trying  to  assassinate  struggling 
soldiers.  The  principal  party  of  rebels  were  under  a  man  named  Whitecoiirt.  Short 
shrift  was  granted  to  any  of  them  who  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  British  troops,  who 
had  peremptory  orders  to  hang  at  once  every  one  taken  in  Canada.  On  the  27th  a 
general  order  from  General  Burgoyne  commanded  all  to  be  in  readiness  to  march. 
On  the  9th  of  August  a  gang  of  deserters  was  captured,  and   all   French  Canadian 


24  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL. 

prisoners  were  condemned  to  work  at  the  fortifications  of  Isle  aux  \oix.  The  62nd 
Regiment  was  ordered  to  cover  the  works  at  St.  Johns,  and  the  other  troops  were 
distributed  along  the  Richelieu.  The  yth,  21st,  62nd  and  29th  Regiments  are  men- 
tioned as  belonging  to  the  ist  and  2nd  Brigades.  Orders  were  issued  in  Sejitember 
to  take  great  precautions  "on  the  Sorel,  Yamaska  and  St.  Francis  against  skulkers." 
All  sjjare  baggage  was  to  be  sent  on  to  Montreal.  All  children  belonging  to  the 
forces  forming  the  expedition  were  also  sent  into  the  city.  Lastly,  all  horses  in  the 
parish  of  Ciiambly  and  surroundings  were  pressed  into  army  service.  After  three 
days  no  horse  was  allowed  to  any  person.  On  the  21st  of  September,  the  47th 
Regiment  was  ready  to  march,  and  all  the  posts  at  Lacolle,  Isle  aux  Xoix,  St.  Johns, 
etc..  were  strictly  guarded.  The  31st  Regiment  on  the  24th  marched  to  St.  Johns. 
On  the  4lh  of  October,  1776,  at  Isle  aux  Xoix,  the  General  issued  general  orders, 
thanking  the  troc-ps  for  the  rapid  progress  made  in  the  i)reparation  of  the  expe- 
dition to  meet  the  enemy,  and  thus  began  the  uivasion  of  the  New  England  colonies  in 
retaliation  for  their  invasion  of  (Canada  the  year  before.  It  resulted  in  General 
Burgoyne  and  his  whole  army  surrendering,  as  prisoners  of  war.  When  he  started  from 
Canada  early  in  the  beginning  of  1777,  he  had  with  him  a  well-equi])pcd  army  of  7000 
men  and  a  large  body  of  Indians.  His  advance  was  executed  with  great  skill  and  intre- 
pidity. He  marched  boldly  on  from  .St.  Johns  into  the  .States,  and  bore  down  all  before 
him.  but  of  no  avail.  At  an  immense  distance  from  his  sujiplies  the  situation  became 
most  hazardous,  and  at  last  he  iiad  to  surrender,  liy  the  terms  made,  the  39th  and 
other  regiments  returned  no  more  to  Canada  during  this  war.  They  were  shi])ped 
either  from  Boston  or  New  York.  The  terms  of  surrender  were  ''  that  the  troops 
should  lay  down  their  arms,  be  sent  home,  and  should  not  serve  again  in  America 
during  the  war."  ( )f  course  this  sad  result  left  many  a  Canadian  fr.niily  in  sorrow  and 
misery,  and  thus  we  find  so  many  petitions  to  the  Governor  for  relief  like  the  follow- 
ing: Agnes  Laforce  l)rays  "  that  her  late  husband  suffered  for  his  loyalty,  and  was 
compelled  to  leave  Virginia,  that  she  and  her  family  were  taken  ])risoners  by 
British  troops  and  Indians,  and  with  thirteen  negroes  taken  to  Detioit,  where  the 
negroes  were  sold."  ( )n  Ivr  arrival  in  Montreal  she  ])rays  for  their  restoration  to  her, 
or  that  their  value  be  paid  her.  We  must  remember  that  this  was  in  January.  17S0, 
and  the  American  war  was  then  going  on.  ( )ne  of  the  most  jiathetic  letters  of  the 
times  is  that  of  Michel  Delisle,  a  l''rencli  Canadian  prisoner  with  the  Americans,  to 
his  wit'i'.  He  regrets  the  se])aration,  ho]»es  for  a  speedy  release,  and  ex])rtsses  sub- 
mission to  the  will  of  Heaven.  Angelique  Godefroy  ])etitions  that  "  her  husband 
has  bt'en  missing  since  the  action  of  the  19th  September.  1777, and  he  is  supposed  to

•  umors  were  rife  of  another  attempted  invasion  of  Canada  by  the  Americans,  ppon- 
tancoiisly,  from  both  Quebec  and  Montreal,  came  addresses  from  the  French  Cana- 
dians to  the  Government,  expressing  indignation  at  the  renewed  attempt  and  their 
determination  to  oppose  it. 

Tiie  address  Hkewise  declared  "  that  the  most  earnest  and  hearty  supi)ort 
should  be  given  to  every  measure  of  defence  necessary  for  the  safety  of  the  p.rov- 
ince."  I  presume  that  the  seeds  of  tliis  loyalty  still  lingered  in  the  hearts  of  the  des- 
cendants of  these  men  ;  at  least  it  was  exemplified  to  the  full  thirty  years  after,  when 
the  Americans  did  actually  invade  their  country,  and  when  the  sons  of  those  men 
who  showed  themselves  faithful  to  England's  Crown,  and  drove  back  the  enemy, 
under  the  command  of  the  immortal  DeSalabcrry,  completely  discomfited  their  ene- 
mies at  the  battle  of  Chateauguay.  God  only  knows  the  amount  of  misery  and  woe 
which  the  ^^'ar  of  Independence  occasioned.  During  the  years  from  177510  17S3, 
when  the  British  Government  at  last  signed  tne  articles  of  freedom  with  the  13  States, 
homes  were  ruined  ;  farmsteads  obliterated,  burned,  or  demolished;  thousands  of 
helpless  women  and  children  wandered  about  homeless,  widows  and  orphans,  and  all 
caused  by  the  stubbornness  of  the  King's  councillor:-,  although  the  ablest  and  great- 
est oratorand  statesmanofthe  time,  liuike,  declared  that ''peace  should  be  made  with 
the  revolted  colonies  even  by  giving  them  their  independence."  Let  me  give  tiie 
character  and  condensed  contents  of  some  of  the  petitions  presented  to  the  Govern- 
ment of  the  country — to  show  the  ])resenl  generation  the  blessings  of  ])eace.  In 
August,  1778,  Thos.  .Sutton,  then  in  Montreal,  an  ensign  of  the  47111  Regiment, 
])rays"fora  bmnity  of  one  year's  pay  granted  to  officers  wounded  in  action,  lie 
having  lost  a  leg  whilst  serving  with  Hurgoyne."  In  1784,  "John  I'"raser,  Judge  of 
Common  Pleas,  Montreal,"  prays  for  '•  payment  of  arrears  while  a  i&gt;risor.er  with  the 
Rebels."  Whether  he  wci-e  taken  ]irisoner  when  Montg(»iiiery  took  Montreal,  and 
carried  away  as  a  sort  of  hostage,  or  captured  at  some  subsetpient  date,  there  is  no 
means  of  kncnving.  It  shows,  however,  that  he  was  a  prisoner  in  the  hands  of  the 
Americans. 

In  October.  1778.  there  is  a  re(iuest  of  sundry  loyal  inhabitants  of  the  frontiers 
of  New  York  and  Pennsylvania  now  in  Montreal,  asking  for  permission  logo  ba&lt;:k  to 
relieve  their  families,  "  they  having  been  carried  off  prisoners  by  the  Indians."  'l"he 
next  is  a  sad  case,  but  shows  the  loyal  spirit  of  the  woman,  i'llizabelh  Tiiompsoni 
ill  ( )clol)er,  i  779,  states  that  "  her  husband,  to  avoid  the  treatment  which  was  threat- 
ened against  him  by  the  Rebels,  had  esca])ed  to  Ireland  ;  she  had  escaj)eil  with  her 
infant  daughter  into  Canada,  and  now  wishes  to  rejoin  her  husband,  and  asks  for  a 
]iassage  to  Cork."  In  1781,  a  number  of  Loyalists  at  St.  Johns  request  to  be 
granted  a  "  flag  of  truce,"  sous  *'  to  get  their  wives  and  children  out  of  the  hands  of 
the  Rebels."  Perhaps  the  most  pathetic  of  all  is  that  of  John  McDonald  from  Mon- 
irral.  He  is  74  years  of  age  and  Iiis  wife  67.  He  says  that"  he  had  nine  sons  1  '' — ■ 
no  liss  than  "seven  in  the  army  of  his  King  and  two  on  the  King's  works."

poverty  from  llic  losses  he  has  sustained,  and  prays  for  relief,  and,  no  doubt,  substantial 
relief  was  meted  out  to  him  for  his  gift  to  his  country  and  the  loss  of  all  his  worldly 
goods  in  the  revolted  colonies. 

No  wonder,  then,  that  we  find  in  the  army  of  Burgoyne  many  Montrealers.  His- 
tory tells  us  there  were  no  less  than  500  Canadians  in  liis  army. 

In  looking  over  the  register  of  the  Rev.  Dr.  Delisle  from  1766  to  1787,  we 
find  very  many  intermarriages.  His  register  was  the  first  English  register  in  Mont- 
real, for  although  there  were  two  Protestant  clergymen  before  him,  viz. :  Rev. 
Mr.  Ogilvie  and  Rev.  Mr.  Bennett,  they  left  no  registers.  Some  of  our  most  influen- 
tial families  are  mentioned,  and  others  whose  names  are  connected  with  the  advance- 
ment and  progress  of  the  province,  and  Montreal  in  particular.  We  find  there  the 
name  of  Simon  Fraser,  of  Wolfe  renown,  also  the  founder's  name  of  McGill  Univer- 
sity and  McGill  street,  "James  McGill." 

Mostly  all  the  names  are  of  common  occurrence,  as  in  these  days,  and  a  large 
percent.ige  Scotch  ;  also  every  man  is  English-speaking  and  every  woman  French- 
speaking,  and  we  know  th^;  result  as  regards  the  religion  of  their  posterity  at  the 
present  day. 

At  this  time,  when  comparing  Montreal  of  1S92  with  Montreal  of  1780,  it  was 
then  indeed  "  a  humble  town."  The  English  mail  was  once  a  month.  It  was  sent  by 
way  of  New  York  after  the  final  signing  of  Independence  by  Great  Britain,  and  was 
four  weeks  in  getting  to  New  York  from  Montreal  to  the  packetship  that  carried 
it  across  the  Atlantic.  One  had  to  wait,  not  four  weeks,  but  four  months,  before 
an  answer  was  received  from  the  other  side.  Let  us  follow  the  answer  back,  of  this 
letter,  which  was  sent  to  Britain  three  months  ago.  The  packet  returning  called 
at  Halifax,  whence  the  letter  would  in  a  month's  time  arrive  in  Montreal.  We  may 
well  be  proud  of  the  19th  century.  Science,  in  many  of  its  most  wonderful  divi- 
sions, lay  slumbering  till  its  advent.  Steam  coaches,  steamships,  steam  mills 
of  every  description,  telegraphs  by  land  and  sea,  telephones  and  phonographs, 
sewing  machines  and  all  the  wonders  by  electricity,  iron  ships  and  ironclads,  smoke- 
less powder,  things  never  before  conceived  nor  thought  of  in  the  mind  of  man — these 
are  the  inventions  of  the  19th  century  ;  and  when  a  daily  mail  leaves  Canada,  not  only 
for  Great  Britain,  but  for  France,  Germany,  Belgium  and  a  host  of  other  countries, 
it  does  seem  strange  to  us  iha.  the  postal  authorities  should  have  issued  this  notice 
about  this  period  :  "  Letters  for  any  part  of  the  Continent  of  F^urope  are  to  be  sent 
under  cover  to  a  correspondent  in  London,  otherwise  they  cannot  be  forwarded  from 
this  i)rovince." 

'I'he  social  condition  of  Montreal  during  these  years  and  succeeding  ones  may  be 
summed  up  by  reading  an  account  of  a  visit  by  Isaac  Weld  in  his  "Travels  in  and 
through  the  States  of  North  America,  etc."  He  speaks  of  Montreal  thus  :  "  There 
are  six  churches  in  Montreal, — one  for  English  Episcopalians,  one  for  Presbyterians 
and  four  for  Roman  Catholics."  "  The  people  of  Montreal  are  remarkably  hospit- 
able and  attentive  to  strangers.  They  are  sociable  also  amongst  themselves,  and  fond 


HISTORY    OF    MONTREAL.  -7 

ill  the  extreme  of  convivial  amusements.  In  winter  they  keep  up  such  a  constant 
and  friendly  intercourse  with  each  other  tliat  it  seems  tlien  as  if  the  town  were  inhab- 
ited but  by  one  large  family.  During  summer  they  live  somewhat  more  retired,  but 
throughout  that  season,- li  club,  formed  of  all  the  principal  inhabitants,  both  male  and 
female,  meet  every  week  or  fortnight  for  the  purpose  of  dining  at  some  agreeable  spot 
in  the  neighborhood  of  the  town."  "  On  this  part  of  tiie  mountain  it  is  that  the  Club, 
which  1  mentioned,  generally  assembles.  Two  stewards  are  appointed  for  the  day, 
who  always  &gt;'hoosc  some  new  spot  wher^  there  is  a  spring  or  rill  of  water  and  an 
agreeal)le  sliade;  each  family  brings  cold  provisions,  wine,  etc.,  tlie  whole  is  put 
togetlier,  and  the  company,  often  amounting  to  one  hundred  persons,  sits  down 
to  dinner." 

This  is  no  doubt  the  effect  of  these  intermarriages  already  spoken  of  Not  agree- 
ing entirely  with  Joseph  F.  R.  Perraultin  his  beautiful  extracts,  which  I  give  as  found 
in  one  of  the  most  interesting  volumes  on  modern  Canada,  from  the  pen  of  Dr.  Bender, 
of  Quebec — still  this  Utopian  period  may  yet  come  in  the  distant  future.  He  says: 
"  Happy,  thrice  iiappy  shall  be  the  day  wiien  Canadians  and  English  of  all  denom- 
inations shall  unitedly  form  but  one  and  tiie  same  family,  have  the  same  institutions, 
speak  the  same  language,  obey  the  same  laws,  and  have  no  other  ambition  than  of 
bearing  the  name  of  Canadians  and  combining  their  efforts  to  maintain  l!ie  glory  of 
the  Ihitish  Emj)ire  and  the  prosperity  of  the  colony  of  Lower  Canada."  This  was 
written  about  1832,  and  before  the  rebellion  of  1837-38. 

To  show  the  state  of  the  social  condition  at  this  time  may  be  also  recorded  the 
following  facts  :  Here  is  an  advertisement  which  appeared  in  the  public  jiress  of 
Montreal  : — 

"Montreal,  ist  April,  1789. 

"To  be  sold — A  stout,  healthy  negro,  about  28  years  of  age,  is  an  excellent 
cook  and  very  fit  for  working  on  a  farm.     Enquire  of  the  Printer." 

As  far  back  as  1777,  John  King,  a  negro,  petitioned  the  Governor,  and  "prays 
that  he  may  be  set  at  liberty,"  and  giving  as  a  reason  his  services  to  the  Govern- 
ment. Then  in  1783,  "  Plato,  a  negro  slave,"  prays  that  he  be  allowed  to  join  his 
own  master.  In  1784,  "  John  Black,  a  negro,"  who  had  served  as  a  seaman  in  His 
Majesty's  service,  "  prays  the  Government  for  a  passport  to  protect  him  in  his  lib- 
erty, of  which  Captain  Martin,  with  whose  wife  he  is  now  serving,  seeks  to  deprive 
him  ;  "  and  in  the  courts  of  178 1,  held  in  tlie  month  of  April,  of  that  year,  one  Samuel 
Judah  makes  a  complaint  "  that  a  negro  man  named  Jacob  was  sold  to  him  by 
Mr.  I,auzon,  having  lived  with  liim  as  his  servant  slave  for  about  five  months,  that  he 
did  assault  him  and  take  him  by  the  collar,  etc.,  etc."  Tiie  Court  ordered  poor 
"Jacob,  the  negro  man,  to  be  committed  to  prison  for  assault,  and  to  find  security 
for  his  future  behavior,"  and  in  the  same  Court  is  this  record  :  "Court  found  tiie  defen- 
dant, Caisar,  a  negro  man,  not  guilty,  and  ordered  him  to  be  discharged."     In 


28  HISTORY   OF    MONTREAL. 

these  days  of  Montreal's  history,  this  time  exactly  loo  years  ago,  slavery  was  one  of 
its  institutions,  and  slaves  were  bought  and  sold  regularly  as  other  goods  and  chattels 
on  the  market. 

Slavery  was  abolished  in  Upper  Canada  by  an  Act  of  Parliament  (held  at  New- 
ark, now  Niagara),  May  31st,  1793.  In  Lower  Canada  a  bill  for  the  same  purpose  was 
brought  into  Parliament  in  1793,  and  not  carried.  It  was  again  brought  up  in  1799 
and  1800,  but  nothing  was  done,  however,  until  1833,  when  slavery  was  abolished  by 
an  Act  of  the  British  Parliament,  sanctioned  August  28th,  1833,  abolishing  slavery 
throughout  the  British  Empire  from  and  after  August  ist,  1834.  But  in  1803,  Chief 
Justice  Osgoode  decided,  at  Montreal,  that  "  slavery  was  incompatible  with  the  laws 
of  the  country." 

In  1780,  Patrick  Langan  sold  to  John  Mittleberger,  a  negro  named  Nero^  foi  ;^6o, 
and  the  last  slave  was  publicly  sold  in  Montreal,  25th  August,  1797.     The  deed  was. 
passed  by  Mr.  Guy  and  his  partner,  notaries.     The  name  of  the  slave  was  Emanuel 
Allen,  aged  2)2&gt;  years;  price,  ;^36.     The  sale  was  afterwards   set  aside  by  legal  pro- 
ceedings. 

This  year,  1777,  much  fighting  took  place  between  the  mother  country  and  the 
revolted  colonies.  Wliilst  these  events  were  in  progress.  Sir  Guy  Caileton,  the 
Governor,  was  devoting  his  attention  to  the  internal  affliirs  of  the  country.  The 
Quebec  Act,  or,  as  it  was  designated,  "  An  Act  for  making  better  provision  for  the 
Government  of  the  Province  of  Quebec  in  Nortli  America,"  had  been  passed  in  1774 
by  tlie  Parliament  of  England,  but  on  account  of  these  troublous  limes  had  never 
been  carried  into  effect.  This  Act,  Carleton  brought  into  active  effect  by  creating 
the  new  council,  wliich  held  its  first  meeting  in  tlie  spring  of  tliis  year.  Five  of  its 
members  were  Frencli  Canadians.  Tiie  courts  of  law  were  now  reorganized  to  con- 
duct their  business  according  to  the  si)irit  of  this  Act;  and  thus  we  find  that  these 
Courts  were  once  more  opened.  The:  court  ojjcned  January  9,  1779.  At  the  March 
term  we  find  several  French  names  as  justices  of  the  peace;  out  of  nine,  five  are 
Frencli,  viz.,  Hertcl  de  Rouville,  Joseph  Longueuil,  Nex'iieiSevcsire,  Pierre  Mezure, 
Pierre  Forlier. 

Tiie  first  time  James  McGill  appears  as  a  justice  is  in  the  September  term.  His 
brother  justice  was  Pierre  Fortier. 

Bread  was  very  dear  at  this  time,  in  the  middle  of  the  American  War,  and 
wheat  was  scarce.  The  brown  loaf  was  30  sols,  or  is  3d,  of  6  lbs.  ;  the  wliite  loaf 
25  sols,  or  IS  o'^^d. 

In  May  tiiere  is  a  schedule  of  the  amounts  (granted  by  the  Court  to  several 
traders)  they  could  purchase  of  different  articles.

This  table  shows  that  Js.  McGill  was  an  extensive  merchant, — one  of  the  largest 
in  Montreal. 

In  tl'.e  Court  of  King's  Bench,  September,  1781,  is  recorded  the  first  murderer 
to  bo  hanged  in  the  history  of  this  Province  since  the  Cession,  William  Blunt. 
Another,  Elijah  Lawrence,  for  grand  larceny,  is  convicted,  sentenced  to  be  hanged 
but  recommended  to  mercy.  No  capital  sentence  was  pronounced  in  Montreal  dur- 
ing the  years  1782  and  1783,  although  in  Quebec  five  men  were  hanged  for  highway 
robbery  and  grand  larceny,  three  being  soldiers.  In  the  presentment  of  the  Grand 
Jury  for  17S2,  they  speak  of  a  disease  known  as  "  Ma/  aiigiois  Lustacn/c  "  or  "  Sib- 
l)i/is."  They  give  reports  by  Blake,  Syn),  Selby  and  Jobert,  surgeons.  This  disease 
was  more  generally  known  as  the  "St.  Paul  Bay  disorder,"  and  wc  find  that  in 
September,  1783,  a  letter  is  sent  from  the  Government  toSurgeon  Blake,  "  to  investi- 
gate, report  and  use  remedial  measures  in  respect  to  the  St.  Paul  Bay  disease." 

In  the  Court,  January,  1784,  a  man  named  Francoeur  is  placed  in  the  stocks 
"  with  a  paper  label  on  his  breast,"  with  these  words  "for  theft"  on  it,  "and  then 
afterwards  he  was  to  be  discharged."  The  sheriff  reminded  this  Court  that  all  persons 
sentenced  to  be  "  burned  in  the  hand  in  the  Court  of  King's  Bench  may  receive 
their  punishment  in  this  Court  agreeable  to  sentence."  Let  us  describe  what  burn- 
ing in  the  hand  was.  This  is  the  first  instance  of  its  being  mentioned  as  a  punish- 
ment on  malefactors.  It  is  often  si)oken  of  during  the  first  25  years  of  this  century. 
The  punishment  consisted  thus:  The  prisoner  was  l)rought  from  the  gaol  into  the 
court  room,  and  made  firm  by  an  iron  hand  at  the  back  of  the  dock,  the  palm  part  of 
his  own  hand  being  opened  tightly.  The  red  hot  iron,  sometimes  ending  either  in 
a  crown  or  some  other  device,  was  held  ready  by  the  connnon  hangman,  and  the 
punishment  was  inflicted  in  the  centre  of  the  palm.  The  instrument  being  ready, 
the  prisoner  is  informed  that  the  moment  it  touches  his  flesh  he  can  repeat  as  fast 
as  he  can  these  words  in  French,  "  Vive  le  Roi,"  three  times,  and  at  the  end  of  the 
third  repetition,  the  punishment  would  cease,  or  the  words  "  God  save  the  King," 
if  he  were  an  English  prisoner.  Even  in  this  short  time,  the  hot  iron  has  hissed  into 
the  flesh,  and  made  such  a  mark  that  all  the  waters  of  the  St.  Lawrence  could  not 
efface  it.  In  the  records  of  the  Court  of  King's  Bench  for  this  year,  we  find  some 
terrible  instances  of  the  punishments  then  meted  out.  In  the  March  term,  eight 
men  for  grand  larceny  were  sentenced  to  be  imprisoned  and  "  burned  in  the  hand." 


30  HISTORY  OF  Montreal- 

Two  men  were  ordered  "  lo  be  twice  wliipped  in  the  pul)lic  market  of  Montreal 
by  the  common  hangman,  and  Josette  Poldevin  was  condemned  to  be  ])laced  in  the 
stocks,  with  a  label  on  her  breast  s[)ecifying  her  crime."  in  the  Sei)tember  term 
this  year,  two  men  for  stealing  cattle  and  sheep  were  condemned  to  be  hanged. 
John  Abbot  and  Henry  Arckle  for  grand  larceny  were  imi)risoned  and  whijJjKd  by 
the  common  hangman.  The  city  and  environs  were  at  this  time  in  a  deplorable 
condition  on  acc(nint  of  the  inisettled  order  of  things.  In  a  commimicalion  of  date 
December,  1783,  and  signed  by  Mr.  James  McGill  and  Mr.  Longneuil  in  behalf  of 
the  magistrates  of  Montreal,  they  i)ray  the  Governor  for  military  assistance  lo  be 
joined  to  the  civilians,  in  order  to  allay  the  terror  of  the  frequent  robberies  in  the 
town,  suburbs  and  adjoining  neighborhood,  found  to  be  committed  by  disbanded 
German  soldiers.  German  regiments  or  Hessians  were  at  one  time  quartered  both  in 
Montreal  and  Quebec. 

The  merchants  of  Montreal  must  have  received  permission  by  this  time  to  have 
a  Custom  House  of  their  own,  as  the  first  case  of  seizure  of  the  Customs  is  recorded 
on  the  22nd  May,  1783,  when  John  Beck,  "  surveyor  of  His  Majesty's  Customs  for  the 
Port  of  Montreal,"  obtained  "a  monition  admonishing  all  persons  to  appear  and 
show  cause,  if  any  they  can,  why  four  cases  of  gin  seized  at  Montreal  on  the  28th 
April  last  should  not  be  condemned  as  forfeited."  No  person  appearing,  the  Court 
granted  the  monition. 

What  would  Mrs.  Maysant  think  if  she  woke  out  of  her  grave  and  saw  at  the 
present  day  the  means  of  conveying  goods  from  Montreal  to  Kingston  ?  She  sent 
a  memorial  to  the  Government  at  this  time  for  leave  "  to  take  a  canoe  load  of  mer- 
chandise to  Cataraqui  (now  Kingston),  for  purposes  of  trade — the  goods  in  tiie  two 
canoes  taken  up  by  her  husband  not  having  been  taken  to  Detroit,  owing  to  the  ves- 
sels being  employed  in  carrying  the  King's  goods,  so  that  by  the  loss  of  the  sales  she 
and  her  family  will  be  exposed  to  great  hardships  during  the  approaching  winter,  if 
the  permission  be  not  granted."  Fancy  her  surprise  when  she  would  look  upon  the 
magnificent  line  of  steamers  and  the  propellers  besides,  as  well  as  the  two  Canadian 
lines  of  railways  of  which  our  country  is  i)roud.  Think  of  the  time  taken  and  the 
danger  and  difficulties  of  the  Rapids  and  Lake  of  a  Thousand  Isles,  of  all  the  fatigue 
and  labor  of  slowly  working  up  that  canoe  load  of  goods  from  Montreal  to  King- 
ston, and  then  we  read  of  a  circumstance  connected  with  just  such  like  journeys  as 
this  in  these  words,  in  a  case  "  against  Theo.  Pellion,  for  having  left  the  plaintiff's 
service  as  a  battoe  man,  contrary  to  his  written  agreement."  In  Court  "  he  acknow- 
ledged his  agreement  to  conduct  a  canoe  to  Detroit,  as  steersman,  but  that  he  left 
the  said  canoe  on  the  way,  finding  it  impossible  to  make  the  voyage  for  want  of  pro- 
per assistance."  A  witness  in  the  case  deposed  thus  in  Court :  "  They  set  out 
from  Lachine,  with  said  canoe  ;  that  when  they  had  reached  Pointe  au  Diable,  the 
defendant  refused  to  proceed  any  further,  saying  it  was  impossible  to  effect  that  voy- 
age without  assistance."  In  spite  of  the  "  Devil's  Point  "  the  poor  man  was  condem- 
ned  to  fourteen  days'  common  gaol.     These  King's  ships  taking  "  the  King's  goods  "

•nd  other  merchandise  as  well  were  not  sufTicient  for  the  purposes  of  commerce,  and 
therefore  we  find  a  petition  from  the  merchants  of  Montreal,  praying  the  Govern- 
ment "  that  private  vessels  may  be  allowed  to  transport  goods  on  the  Lakes," — 
«  the  reduction  (1784,  and  after  peace  had  been  proclaimed  between  Great  Britain 
gnd  the  United  States)  of  the  naval  armaments  leading  them  to  apprehend  that  other- 
wise their  goods  would  not  reach  the  markets  in  the  upper  country."  Tlie  Governor 
in  a  week  after  writes  to  them  that  a  third  vessel  would  be  employed  and  remain  on 
the  Lakes.  His  secretary  also  writes  officially,  and  tells  the  merchants  that  they 
"delay  in  paying  the  freight  of  goods  carried  by  the  King's  vessels  over  the  lakes." 
Thev  are  *'  urged  to  discharge  punctually  their  debts  on  this  account." 

After  the  year  1784  the  punishment  of  whipping  never  exceeds  thirty-nine 
iashcs,  and  they  are  all  delivered  at  once.  I  presume  the  Justices  had  it  in  their 
mind  what  St.  Paul  wrote  about  the  nu  mber  he  had  received  :  "  Three  times  received 
I  of  the  Jews  forty  stripes  save  one." 

The  justices  in  1795  seem  all  to  have  old  country  names — viz.,  John  McKind- 
lay,  Robt.  Cruickshank,  Charles  Blake,  John  Lilly,  Thomas  McCord,  and  Alexander 
Henry.    Wm.  Lindsay  appears  at  General  Sessions  in  January,  1799. 

Before  finishing  this  sketch  of  old  Montreal  in  the  i8th  century,  I  will  insert  the 
trial  and  execution  of  the  only  person  who  underwent  death  for  "  high  treason  "  in  the 
lirst  fifty  years  of  the  British  rule  of  Canada.  Before  the  next  fifty  passed,  no  less 
than  twelve  individuals  suffered  in  Montreal  at  the  gaol  for  tjiis  crime,  and  we  all  know 
that  during  the  third  half  century  one  individual,  Louis  Rielle,  thus  also  suffered.  Tiic 
following  trial  is  remarkable,  not  only  for  the  atrocity  of  the  sentence,  its  ap- 
plication and  the  occasion,  but  that  it  entirely  was  uncalled  for  in  the  circumstances 
cf  the  case.  Different  individuals  had  for  years,  before,  during  and  after  the  war 
of  Independence,  endeavored  to  detach  the  loyalty  of  the  Canadians  from  the 
jUitish  Crown,  but  all  had  signally  failed. 

In  1797,  the  first  execution  for  "high  treason  "  took  place,  and  although  it  was 

arricd  out  in  Quebec  city,  most  of  the  circumstances  connected  with  it  were  done 

y  the  prisoner  in  Montreal,  St.  Johns  and  places  on  the  borders  of  Canada  and  the 

nitcd  States.     The  prisoner  who  was  executed  was  named  David  McLane.     He 

■as  an  American  citizen,  and  employed  as  an  emissary  of  Mr.  Audel,  who  at  this  time 

ivas  the  representative  of  the  New   French  Republic  at  Washingto-n.     The  scheme 

ivas  a  gigantic  one,  and  was  the  extinction  of  the  British  power  on  this  Continent  and 

he  entire  subjugation  of  the  French  inhabitants   to  the  powers  at  Washington. 

"rely  he  might  have  known  that  all  former  attempts  had  signally  failed;  even  the 

jrcnowncd  Franklin  had  to  leave  Montreal  with  the  word  failed  written  on  his  brow. 

McLane  visited  Canada  in  1796,  and  endeavored  to  gain  the  symi)athy  of  the  Cana- 

'•"tn  people,  but  he  did  not  succeed.     Next  year,  1797,  he  returned.     Beginning  at 

t-  Johns,  he,  with  a  man  named  Frechette,  came  to  Montreal,  and  continued  and 

gjyicd  hard  to  get  the  inhabitants  to  abjure  the  British  Crown.     At  List  he  arrived  in 

^icbec,  and  unfolded  his  grand  scheme   (as  he  thought  it)  to  a  Mr.  John  Black, 


32  HISTORY    OV    MONTRF.AL. 

member  of  tl\c  AsscniMy.  At  once  he  was  denounced  to  the  Government,  and  was 
arrested  for  '"high  treason."  I  need  not  enter  on  the  chimerical  plan  which  he 
had  formed,  but  after  a  patient  trial  he  was  condcmried  by  Chief  Justice  Osgood  in 
the  fallowing  sentence:  ''That  you,  David  McLane,  be  taken  to  the  place  from 
whence  you  came,  and  from  thence  you  are  to  be  drawn  to  the  place  of  execution — 
where  you  must  be  hanged  by  the  neck,  but  not  till  you  arc  dead — for  you  must  bo 
cut  down  alive  and  your  bowels  taken  out  and  burnt  before  your  face  ;  then  your 
head  must  be  severed  from  your  body,  which  must  be  divided  into  four  parts,  and 
your  head  and  your  quarters  be  at  the  King's  disjiosal,  and  may  the  Lord  have  mercy 
on  your  soul."  This  terrible  and  horrible  sentence  was  not  quite  fully  carried  out. 
It  was  intended  to  terrify  the  Canadians  and  American  sympathizers.  IJut  the 
execution  was  ghastly  indeed.  Dc  Gaspe's  work  on  "Canadians  of  Old  "  gives  a 
very  gra[)h.ic  description  of  it.  Let  me  condense  it  here.  He  says  :  "Artillery  and 
a  body  of  troops  paraded  the  streets,  and  accompanied  the  prisoner  to  the  place  of 
execution.  There  McLane  was  seated  on  a  sledge  with  runners  which  grated  on  the 
earth  rul  stones.  He  was  back  to  the  horse,  and  an  axe  and  block  stood  on  the 
front  of  the  sledge.  He  was  of  high  stature  and  remarkably  handsome.  Dr.  Duvert 
pulled  out  his  watch  as  soon  as  Ward,  the  executioner,  had  withdrawn  the  ladder,  on 
which  rested  McLane,  lying  on  his  back,  with  the  rope  around  his  neck,  hanging 
from  the  gallows  ■  the  body  then  struck  the  northern  side  of  the  gallows'  post  and 
remained  stationary  after  a  few  jerks.  *  He  is  stone  dead,'  said  Dr.  Duvert,  after 
Ward  had  cut  him  down  at  the  end  of  twenty-eight  minutes  ;  '  he  will  be  insensible  to 
what  shall  follow.'  Ward  then  opened  his  body,  took  out  his  heart  and  bowels,  which 
he  burned  in  a  *  rechaud.'  He  then  cut  off  his  head,  and  held  up  this  bloody  trophy  to 
the  gaze  of  the  crowd."  Let  me  finish  all  in  the  words  of  Christie,  the  Historian,  on 
the  subject,  where  he  says  :  "This  from  the  Conquest  to  that  time  is  the  only 
instance  in  Canada  of  a  trial  for  '  high  treason,'  and  it,  be  it  also  observed,  not  of 
a  British  subject.  It  is  creditable  to  the  Canadian  character  that,  with  the  single 
exception  mentioned,  none  were  connected  with  McLane,  the  very  absurdity  of 
whose  scheme  denoted  him  a  mere  maniac,  and  who  might  with  more  propriety  iiave 
been  treated  as  an  unhappy  lunatic  than  as  a  criminal." 

The  following  description  of  Montreal  is  taken  from  a  rare  and  old  book  written 
by  Isaac  Weld,  and  titled,  "  Travels  through  the  States  of  North  America  and  the 
Provinces  of  Upper  and  Lower  Canada  during  the  years  1795  and  1797  "  :— 

"  MoNTREAi.,  July,  1797. 

''  The  town  of  Montreal  was  laid  out  pursuant  to  ihe  orders  of  one  of  the  kings 
of  France  ;  which  were,  that  a  town  should  be  built  as  high  up  the  St.  Lawrence  as 
it  was  possible  for  vessels  to  go  by  sea.  In  fixing  upon  the  spot  where  it  stands,  his 
commands  were  complied  with  in  the  strictest  sense.  The  town  at  present  contains 
about  twelve  hundred  houses,  whereof  five  hundred  only  are  within  the  walls  ;  the 
rest  are  in  the  suburbs  which  commence  from  the  north,  east  and  west  gates  \  the 
houses  in  the  suburbs  are  mostly  built  of  wood,  but  the  others  are  all  of  stone  ;  none 


HISTORY   OI'    MONTREAL.  33 

of  ihem  arc  elegant,  l)ut  there  are  many  very  comfortable  habitations.  In  the  lower 
pan  uf  the  town  towards  the  river,  where  most  of  the  shops  stand,  they  have  a  very 
gloomy  ap|)earar\ce,  and  look  like  so  many  prisons,  being  all  furnished  at  the  outside 
with  sheet  iron  shutters  to  the  doors  and  windows,  which  are  regularly  closed  towards 
evening,  in  order  to  guard  against^fuc.  The  town  has  suffered  by  fire  very  mate- 
rially al  different  times,  and  the  inhabitants  have  such  a  dread  of  it  that  all  who  can 
afford  it  cover  the  roofs  of  their  houses  with  tin  plates  instead  of  shingles.  Bylaw 
thev  are  obliged  to  have  one  r)r  more  ladders,  in  proportion  to  the  size  of  the  house, 
always  ready  on  tlie  roofs. 

•'  The  streets  are  all  very  narrow  ;  three  of  them  run  parallel  to  tlic  river,  and 
these  arc  intersected  by  others  at  riglit  angles  but  not  at  regular  distances.     On  the 
side  of  the  town  farthest  from  the  river,  and  nearly  between  the  northern  and  southern 
extremities,  there  is  a  small  square  called  Tyi  Place  d'Armes,  which  seems  originally  to 
have  been  left  open  to  the  walls  on  one  side,  and  to  have  been  intended  for  the  military 
to  exercise  in  ;  the  troops,  however,  never  make  use  of  it  now,  but  parade  on  a  long 
walk  behind  the  walls,  nearer  to  the  barracks.     On  the  opposite  side  of  the  town, 
towards  the  water,  is  another  small  square  where  the  market  is  held,     'i'hcrc  arc  six 
churches   in   Montreal  :  one  for   English   Episcopalians,   one  for  Presbyterians,  and 
four   for   Roman    Catholics.     The   Cathedral  church  belonging  to  the  latter,  which 
occupies  one  side  of  La  Place  d'.Vrmes,  is  a  very  spacious  building,  [and  contains 
five    altars,   all   very  richly  decorated.     There  are  in  Montreal  four  convents,  one  of 
which  is  of  the  (&gt;rder  of  .St.   Francis  ;    the  number  of  the  friars,  however,  is  reduced 
iunv  to  two  or  three,  and  as  by  tiie  laws  of  the  Province  men  can  no  longer  enter  into 
any  religious  order,  it  will  o'  course  in  a  few  years  dwindle  entirely  away.     In  the 
female  order  there  is  no  restriction,  and  they  are  still  well    filled.     The    Hotel-Dieu, 
I'oinided  as  early  as  1644  for  the  relief  of  the  sick  poor,  and  which  is  the  oldest  of  the 
convents,  contains    thirty    '  religieuses,'  nuns  ;   La  Congregation  de   Notre-Oame, 
instituted  for  the  instruction  of  young  girls,  contains  fifty-seven   soeurs,  another  sort 
of  nuns  ;  L'H(5pital  General,    for   the  accommodation  of  the   infirm   poor,  contains 
eighteen  suiurs.     The  barracks  are  agreeably  situated  near  the  river,  at  the  lower  end 
of  the  town  ;   they  arc  surrounded  by  a  lofty  wall,  and  calculated  to  contain  about 
three  hundred  men. 

•'  The  walls  round  the  town  are  mouldering  away  very  fast,  and  in  some  places  are 
totally  in  ruins.  The  gates,  however,  remain  quite  perfect.  The  walls  were  built 
principally  as  a  defence  against  the  Indians,  by  whom  the  country  was  thickly  inhab- 
ited when  Montreal  was  founded,  and  they  were  found  necessary  to  repel  the  open 
attacks  of  these  people  as  late  as  the  year  1736.  When  the  large  fairs  used  to  be 
held  111  Montreal,  to  which  the  Indians  from  all  parts  resorted  with  their  furs,  they 
were  also  found  extremely  useful,  as  the  inhabitants  were  thereby  enabled  to  shut 
out  the  Indians  at  night,  who,  had  they  been  suffered  to  remain  in  the  town,  addicted 
as  they  are  to  drinking,  might  have  been  tempted  to  commit  great  outrages,  and 
would    have   kept    the    inhabitants    in    a   continual   state  of  alarm.     The  people  of 

:i 


34  HISTORY    OF    MONIREAL. 

Montreal  are  remarkably  hospitable  and  attentive  to  slr,inge''s.  They  are  sociable 
also  amongst  themselves,  and  tbiid  in  the  extreme  of  convivial  amusement.;.  In 
winter  they  keep  np  such  a  constant  and  friendly  intercourse  with  each  other  that 
it  seems  then  as  if  the  town  were  inhabited  but  by  one  large  family.  During  sum-. 
mer  they  live  somewhat  more  retired,  but  throughout  that  seasi)n,  a  elul),  formed  of 
all  the  principal  inhabitants,  both  male  and  female,  meet  e\ety  week  or  fortnight  for 
the  purpose  of  dining  at  some  agreeable  spot  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  town. 

'*  The  Island  of  Montreal  is  agreeably  diversified  with  hill  and  dale,  and  toward.s 
its  centre,  in   the  neighborhood  of  .\[ontreal,  there  are  two  or  three  consideral)le 
mountains.     The   largest  of  these  stands  at  tlu'  distance  of  about  one  mile  from  the 
town  which  is   named   from  it.     The  base  of  this  mountain  is  surrounded  with  neat 
country  houses  and  gardens,  and  |)artial  improvements  have  lieen  made  about  one- 
third  of  the  way  up  ;  the  remainder  is  entirely  covered  with  lofty  trees.     On  that  side 
towards  the  river  is  a  large  old  monastery  with  extensive  inclosures  walled  in,  round 
which  the  ground  has  been  cleared  for  some  distance.     'Hiis  open  part  is  covered 
with  a  rich  verdure,  and  the  woods    encircling  it,   instead  of  being  overrun  with 
brushwood,     are    quite   clear  at    bottom,    so   tnat   you    may    here    roam    about    at 
pleasure  for  miles  together,  shaded  by  the  lofty  trees  from  the  rays  of  the  sun.     The 
view  from  hence  is  grand  beyond  description.     .A.  prodigious  expanse  of  country  is 
laid  open   to  the  eye  with  the  noble  River  St.  J^awrence  wending  through  it,  which 
may  be  traced  from  the  remotest  part  of  the  horizon.     The  river  comes  from  the  right 
and  flows  smoothly  on,  after  passing  down  the  tremendous  rapids  above  the  town, 
where  it  is  hurried  over  iiigh  rocks  with  a  noise  tliat  is  heard  even  up  the  mountain. 
On  the  left  below  you  appears  the  town  of  Montreal  with  its  churches,  monasteries, 
glittering   s[)ires,  and  the  shipping  under  its  old   wall.     Several    little    islands  in  the 
river  near  the  town,  partly  improved,  jjartly  overgrown  with  wood,  add  greatly  to 
the  beauty  of  the  scene.     Laprairie  with  its  large  church  on  the  distant  side  of  the 
river  is  seen  to  the  greatest  advantage,  and  beyond  it  is  a  range  of  lofty  mountains 
which   terminates   the  prosi)ect.      Such   an   endless  variety,  and  such  a  grandeur  is 
there  in  the  view  from  this  part  of  die  mountain,  that  even  those  who  are  most 
habituated  to  the  view  always  find   it  a  fresh  subject  of  admiration  whenever  they 
contemplate  it  :  and  on  this  part  of  the  mountain  it  is  that  the  club  which  I  mentioned 
generally  assembles.     Two  stewards  are  appointed  for  the   day,  who  always  choose 
some  new  ^)oi  where  is  a  spring  or  rill  of  water  and  an  agreeable  shade  ;  each  family 
brings  cold  provisions,  wine,  etc.,  the  whole  is  put  together,  and  the  company,  often 
amounting  to  one  hundred  persons,  sits  down  to  dinner." 

THE  NINETEENTH  CENTURY. 

From  authentic  sources  we  find  that  from  the  commencement  of  the  century 
to  1816  "  sixty-four  houses  built  of  stone  were  erected  within    the  old  gates." 

On  the  loth  January,  1800,  the  following  gentlemen  as  jurors  appeared  at  the

The  inhibilants  of  .Moiitreal,  having  hitherto  felt  very  much  inconvenienie  from 
the  scanty  sujiply  of  water,  determined  to  remedy  the  evil.  They  had  been  accus- 
tomed to  get  their  water  (not  over  clean)  from  the  St.  Lawrence,  or  from  the  town 
punijis  which  were  placed  in  I'lacc  d'Arnies.  the  market  place  (now  Custom  Huuse 
Square),  the  Jesints'  (iarden  which  lay  near  the  Court  House,  and  a  U:w  other 
localities.  "  Phe  proprietors  of  the  Moiureal  \V^lter  Works."  therefore,  procured  a 
Charter,  and  were  authorized  to  erect  buildings  and  lay  down  pipes  within  the  city. 
A  clause  in  tlrj  Coni|Kiny's  .\ct  enjoined  that  no  shaieholdcr  could  hold  more  than  six- 
teen .■^iiare'i  of  the  fir.Tl  amount  raised  and  eight  in  the  second.  It  gave  the  Company 
exclusive  right  for  50  years  of  supplying  the  City  wiih  water.  'I'liis  wa.s  the  com-

In  December,  1S05,  the  news  arrived  in  Montreal  of  tlie  death  of  Nelson  at  the 
Battle  of  Trafalgar. 

\  ball  was  being  held  n\  the  Exchange  Coffee  House  at  the  corner  of  St.  ]'aul 
and  St.  Peter  streets.  During  sup[)cr  the  news  arrived,  which  powerfully  affecteel  a 
number  of  the  company.  Many  ladies  present  wiire  seen  to  shed  tears.  Under  the 
excitement  of  the  moment  the  chairman  proposed  that  a  monument  should  be  erect, 
ed  to  his  memory  and  a  subscriptiori  ojjened  to  defray  the  cost  of  the  same.  Ladies 
and  gentlemen  then  and  there  in  their  beautitul  ball  dresses,  French  and  English  alike, 
pressed  forward  to  put  down  their  names,  so  that  in  a  few  minutes  a  sum  sufticient 
tor  the  purpose  was  subscribed,  and  a  committee  appointed  to  carry  oui  the  undertak- 
ing.    This  is  the  true  story  of  Nelson's  monument  in   Jacques  Carlier  Square. 

Heriotinhistravels  thus  speaks  of  Montreal  at  this  period  : —  ''The  streets  are  airy 
and  regularly  disposed — one  of  them  (St.  Paul)  extending  nearly  parallel  to  the  river

through  llie  einirelengtli  of  the  place  ;  they  are  of  sufficient  width,  Ijeing  intersected  ;it

THE  FIRST  .STEAMHOATS  OF  THE  ST.  LAWRENCE. 

i'roni  ihc  days  when  Jacques  Carlier  first  sailed  on  the  waters  of  the  Si.  Law- 
rence river  to  llie  beginning  of  this  nineteenth  century — thai  is  for  over  250  years — 
all  travel  between  ()uel)ec  and  Montreal  had  either  been  by  a  tedious  journey  along 
the  north  or  south  banks  of  the  river,  and  occupying  many  weary  and  tlreary  days  ; 
or  by  the  almost  e(iually  weary  and  dreary  mode  of  batteaux, — sailing  i)artly  and 
pulled  partly,  hul  niosily  pulled  along  ihe  banks. 

This  waterw;iy  was  thai  by  which  many  e\pedilion&gt;  during  the  regime  of '"  La 
llellc  I'lancc  "  went  either  to  victory  or  sometimes  annihilation  from  the  hands  of 
thi'  savage  Indians,  their  powerful  enemies,  who  then  swarmed  throughout  the 
country. 

It  also  was  ihe  route  by  which,  aflci  "  the  Cession,"  Hrilish  troops  and  expe- 
ditiiuis  were  sent  from  the  "  .Ancient  C'apital  "  to  various  i)oints  and  places  throughout 
the  continent,  and  ])revious  to  railways. 

It  was  by  this  route,  thebcjsom  of  the  Si.  Liwrenre,  thai  Ihe  chivalrous  Jaciiues 
Caitier  came  when  he  discoveied  Hodielaga — now  Montreal. 

It  was  by  this  route  thai  llu-  grial  explorer  Champlain  came  when  he  gave  its 
name  to  I.achiiu.'  (the  way  to  China  ),  and  passed  on  and  pushed  westward  even  to  the 
( ieorgian  Hay  of  Lake  Huron. 

On  its  bosom  sailed  the  expedilion  under  Cieneral  Murray,  which  resulted  in  the 
capilul.ilion  of  Montre.il  in  1760, 

i{y  the  olhei  route.  /.  r.Aty  land,  the  army  ol  .Moiitgonurv  pa'-sed  on  to  besiege 
f^&gt;uebec,  and  lo  meet  there  with  defeat,  and  ihe  Oeiieral  with  his  deaih. 

Hardships  iniuimeiable  presented  lliunsclves  in  ihc  laud  journey,  whilst  dan- 
gers by  day  and  by  night  conliiiually  stared  Ihe  hardy  voyageiirs  in  the  face  when  the&gt; 
mad"  Iheir  journeys  from  (^)uebec  lo  Montreal.  This  was  always  the  moie  diflicult 
of  the  two  journeys — the  heav&gt;  and  swili  llowiiig  currents  of  the  Si.  I  iwreiit  e  made

\()  wonder  tlien  iluu  wlieii,  in  the  year  1809  a  citizen  oi"  Nloiuical,  John  Moi,- 
soN  by  name,  declared  that  lie  would  navigate  the  St.  Lawrence  between  these  two 
cities  ill  a  \essel  propelled  by  steam,  and  in  one-tenth  of  the  time  occupied  hereto- 
fore bv  either  route,  and  against  all  wind  and  tide,  he  had  all  the  city  incredulous. 
Montreal  lauuhed  at  iiim,  and  declari'd  it  could  never  i)e  done.  .\[ontreal  said  it 
was  impossible.  .\11  the  city  unanimously  declaied  it  w.is  tlu  itlea  of  an  enthusiast, 
and  utterly  impracticable. 

Xeverdieless  there  were  some  who  had  heard  the  news  that  such  a  thing  had 
been  done  at  .\ew  \'ork.  'i'hcio  l-"i;r,i'()N  had  sailed  his  little  steamer  sui  ce-^sfuiiy 
without  sail  or  o;ir.  on  the  River  Hudson,  not  long  before. 

John  \roi„i()N  thought  what  could  be  done  in  New  York  and  on  the  Hudson  lOuld 
ti/so  be  doih'.  in  Montreal  and  on  the  St.  Lawrence,  .\fter  patiently  woiking  and  com- 
])letingall  the  parts  ol' his  little  craft,  this  enterprising,  energetic  and  public-spirited 
merchant,  on  tiie  j^rd  tlay  of  November,  1S09,  got  the  steam  up  in  his  ••  Ai  co  M.\ri  id.v- 
■n&lt;&gt;\.''  as  the  vessel  was  called,  and  amidst  the  hu/,/.is  and  the  clv'ers  of  almost  the

little  criift  &gt;hoi  into  the  ciirient  of  Si.  Mary,  and  after  a  vovage  of  66  innrs.  ,?o  of 
which  she  was  at  anchor,  safely  arrived  at  ()uel)ec.  Here  the  whoie  ciix.asin  .Mon-

HISTORY    OF    MONTRKAL.  39 

Canada,  as  a  Colony  of  (ireat  Britain,  had  made  rapid  progress  since  its  cession 
to  the  Union  Jack  in  A.D.  1759.  It  must  be  said  trnthfully  that  in  the  latter  years  of 
the  ;-&lt;%''''"'■  &gt;^*  "  J-"'^  Belle  France,"  the  colonists  were  treated  in  such  a  manner  that 
after  a  trial  of  King  Ceorge's  Ciovernment — for  nearly  seventeen  years — they 
unanimously  declared  that  the  flag  of  England  was  preferable  to  the  "  Fleur  de  l.ys  " 
of  France — and  why  ? 

After  ihe  (Session,  the  British  Commander,  (leneral  Murray,  decreed  that  all 
things  should  he  done  "  decently  and  in  order.''  The  habitants  luiist  be  paid 
lionestly  in  ■'  hard  cash  "  for  whate\er  they  l)rougiit  either  to  the  markets  or  to  the 
ijritish  Cantonments  for  sale.  Rights  were  resijected,  the  Religion,  Language,  and 
T.aws  of  the  I'rovince  were  secured,  and  every  thing  was  done  to  content  the  peoi)le. 
Lvery  l^'renchman  and  i-'rench  Canadian  who  had  remained  in  the  countr)  felt  securer 
now,  and  more  at  ease,  than  in  those  lasi  days  of  l'"rancf's  hold  upon  her  territories  in 
i\orth  -America.  Had  not  King  ( ieoige  himself  called  them  '' His  Children  ? ''  and 
thev  knew  that  a  better  era  had  begun  to  c'iawn  on  Canada. 

No  wonder  then  that  when  trouble c.ime  to  Fngland— in  the  l\e\&lt;iltof  her  ihuleeii 
States  (;r  ("olonies — Canada  remained  faithful  to  her,  and  tlinl  it  look  two  armies  inider 
Montgomery  and  Arnold  to  enter  her  suil,  but  only  to  experience  defeat,  disordei'  and 
death,  and  to  leave  tlie  coinUrv  )nore  faithful  still  to  the  iiritish  Crown  than  even 
licfore  the  Revolution  (jf  the  American  States. 

\Mkii  we  turn  to  Montreal,  we  find  the  same  patriotism  displayed  in  both  her 
Knglish  an&lt;l  her  !•' ranch  inh.abitants  :  and  although  by  the  fortunes  of  war  the  Army 
of  Montgomu-}- ,//&lt;/ caplurt.  the  city,  and  tlu;  "  Stars  and  Slri[)es  "  waved  defiantly 
over  .Nfarieopolis,"  it  was  only  t'or  a  short  period.  It  soon  passed;  but  the  recol- 
lection of  [776  rankled  in  the  breasts  of  all,  and  from  father  to  son  descended  ihis 
feeling,  and  to  them  ajiplied  the  words  of  the  Knglish  poet  Byron  :  — 

"  Have  left  tlieii'  sons  .1  hope,  .t  f.inie, 
They  too  would  lalhev  die  lliari  sliame." 

A  generation  had  to  be  born  before  retaliation  came  ;  but  about  thirty-seven  years 
after,  thc^   wiped  the  stigma  of  their  fathers  off  at  the  Battle  of  Chateauguay. 

I'liis  episode  of  C:. nadian  History  would  never  have  been  written  had  it  not 
belli  tor  Br(.'ck — Sir  Isaac  Hkik  k — the  Hero  of  I'pper  Canada,  as  DeSalabcrry 
is  that  of  Lower  ("anula  for  all  time  to  come.  The  first  honor  of  wiping  out  the 
defeat  of  Burgoyne  at  Saratoga  fell  to  the  Upper  Canadians,  when  they  captured  the 
entire  American  .Army  under  (leneral   Hull,  at  Detroit. 

Thus,  after  thirty-six  years,  or  after  nearly  fifty  two  )ears  from  tlu' Cession,  on  a 
sunny  and  leafy  day  in  the  month  of  June  (the  iHth),  1812,  Congress  declared  war 
against  Cleat  Ihitain.  \\s  some  strange  omission  on  the  p.irt  of  the  British  Minister  at 
W.ishington,  the  otticial  notification  did  not  reacli  the  Governor  of  Canada— "Sir 
George  Prevosi  " — until  the  7Lh  day  of  July.  General  Hrock  was  never  otficially 
notified  at  all.     Mr.  Richarelson,  who   was  afterwards   Hon.  John    Kichardsoii,  of 


40  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL. 

Montreal,  apprised  him  of  it,  through  a  private  means,  about  tiie  25th  of  June.  But 
the  Canadians  were  not  slow.  And  who  were  these  Canadians  who  had  to  withstand 
the  first  brunt  and  shock  of  battle  in  Upper  Canada? — thp:  United  Empire  Loyal- 
ists! !  As  one  writer  fitly  remarks  : — "  Loyally  to  England,  fealty  to  the  Crown, 
were  the  birthright  and  heirloom  of  this  i)eople."  The  first  settlers  of  tliis  western 
soil  were  the  fathers  and  mothers — American  Loyalists,  men  of  educated  and  ele- 
vated minds,  who  had  lost  their  &lt;?// in  the  United  States  by  iheir  staunch  loyally  to 
the  British  Tjnone,  They  had  during  these  past  thiriy-six  or  thirty-seven  years 
made  homes  for  themselves  and  families  in  the  Canadian  forests,  and  they  were  not 
again  going  to  lose  their  homes  to  these  American  enemies  as  they  hnd  their  first. 

And  when  the  thunder-cloud  burst,  it  found  them  prepared  to  venture  all  for 
"  Hearth  and  Home."  General  Hull  crossed  over  from  Detroit,  and  landed  amongst 
a  quiet,  inoffensive  agricultural  people.  Immediately  he  issued  a  iHoclaniation.  To 
give  Canadians  now  in  this  last  decade  of  the  century  some  idea  what  this  document 
meant,  let  me  state  that  it  denied  the  right  of  the  Indian  to  defend  his  own  native 
soil,  and  doomcil  to  death  every  lohite  man  found  fighting  by  his  side.  It  threatened 
all  Canadians  who  resisted  with  "  the  horrors  and  calamities  of  war,''  and  offered  to 
any  who  would  quietly  join  the  American  flag,  ''  ])eace,  lil)erty  and  security." 

To  this  terri/'/e  ukase  Brock  simply  rejilied,  that  the  Crown  of  England  would 
defend  and  avenge  all  her  subjects,  whether  red  or  white,  and  that  Canada  knew  her 
duty  to  herself  and  her  Sovereign,  and  "was  neither  to  be  bullied  nor  cajoled  into  a 
departure  from  it." 

Not  long  after  Hull's  crossing  into  Canada  he  saw  that  he  had  made  a  groat 
mistake.  He  had  to  draw  all  his  resources  from  his  rear,  and  when,  on  the  4lh  of 
August,  the  Indian  warrior  Tecumseh  met,  defeated  and  scattered  Van  Home's 
detachment — the  American  Commander  of  that  division  of  the  United  States  army— 
and  secured  all  the  jjrovisions  and  the  mail.  Hull  was  appalled.  On  the  7th  and 
.Sth.  he  withdrew  himself  and  army  across  the  river, — sneaking  away,  and  mightily  dif- 
ferent from  his  defiant  proclamation, — and  resumed  his  occupation  of  Detroit.  And 
although  a  temporary  check  was  given  the  British  and  Canadians  at  Maguaga  or 
Brownstown,  as  it  is  called,  yet,  a  most  gallant  deed  was  performed  by  the  captur- 
ing of  Foil  Macinaw  by  Capt.  Roberts  and  Toussaint  Fothier,  afterwards  the  Hon. 
Toussaint  Pothier,  ^LL.C,  of  Montreal.  When  Roberts  told  him  his  plans,  I'othier 
answered  with  delight  •  "  Pardieu,  Monsieur,  il  faut  frolier  ces  gens  la  bas,  jolieineiit." 
The  fori  fell  into  their  hands,  with  all  the  military  stores  and  valuable  furs,  and  the 
laughable  side  of  the  enterprise  was  that  the  American  Commandant  did  not,  until 
then,  know  of  the  war  between  the  two  countries.  This  chivalrous  event  disconcerted 
Hull  still  more. 

Now,  came  General  Brock's  turn,  in  the  correspondence  which  fell  into  Te&lt;  um- 
sch's  hands  on  the  4th  of  August  by  the  defeat  of  Van  Home,  Brock  found  that  Hull 
had  much  fear  and  many  misgivings  of  the  army  under  his  conimand.  Urock,  there- 
fore, crossed  the  river,  invested  Detroit  with  330  regulars  of  His  Majesty's  forces  and 


HISTORY   OF    MONTREAL.  4I 

400  militia,  dressed  in  red  coats,  and  wlien  the  preparations  for  an  assault  were  all 
ready,  suddenly  there  was  seen  to  emerge  from  the  works  of  the  enemy  an  officer 
who  bore  a  flag  of  truce.  Hull  resolved  to  capitulate,  and  proposed  a  cessation  of  hos- 
tilities. Immediately  articles  were  drawn  up  then  and  there.  The  whole  Michigan 
territory,  Fort  Detroit,  a  ship  of  war  at  Detroit,  33  pieces  of  cannon,  many  stores, 
the  military  chest,  2,500  troops,  and  one  stand  of  colors  surrendered  to  the  Jiritish. 

This  surrender  of  Detroit  electrified  all  Canada.  It  was  the  very  first  occasion 
in  which  the  Miliiia  had  been  engaged,  and  their  courage  and  success  encouraged 
every  one. 

And  so  it  came  to  pass  that  this  episode  in  Montreal's  History  at  the  beginning 
of  this  century  tjok  place.  The  effect  produced  in  Lower  Canada  was  as  great  as 
in  Upi)er  Canada. 

Let  us  quote  the  following  account  from  the  Montreal  Jferaiif  of  'I'uesday, 
September  12th.  181 2,  of  the  entry  of  General  Hull  and  his  army,  etc.,  as  prisoners 
of  war  into  Montreal.     It  says: 

"  Nlontreal,  Seutember  12th  :  l^a^t  Sunday  evening,  the  inhabitants  of  this  city 
were  gratified  with  an  exhibition  ecpially  novel  and  interesting. 

"  That  (leneral  Hull  should  have  entered  our  city  so  soon  at  the  head  of  his  troops, 
rather  exceeded  our  expectations.  We  were,  however,  happy  to  see  him,  and  leceived 
him  with  all  the  honors  due  to  his  rank  and  importance  as  a  public  character.  The 
following  jjarticulars  relative  to  his  journey  and  reception  at  Montreal  may  not  be

''  Ceneral  Hull  and  suite,  accompanied  by  about  25  officers  and  350  soldiers,  left 
Kingston  imder  an  escort  of  130  men,  commanded  by  Major  Heathcote  of  the  New- 
foundland regiment.  At  Cornwall  the  escort  was  met  by  Captain  (iray  of  the  Quarter- 
Master  General's  Department,  who  took  charge  of  the  prisoners  of  war,  and  from 
thence  proceeded  with  them  to  Lachine,  where  they  arrived  about  two  o'clock  on 
Sunday  afternoon.  .At  Lachine,  Captains  Richardson  and  Ogilvie  with  their  companies 
of  Montreal  Militic^  and  a  company  of  the  King's,  commanded  by  Captain  Blackmore, 
formed  the  escort  till  they  were  met  by  Col.  Auldjo  with  the  remainder  of  the  flank 
companies  of  the  Militia,  upon  which  Captain  Ulackmore's  company  fell  out  and  pre- 
sented arms  as  the  General  passed  with  the  others,  and  then  returned  to  Lachine, 
leaving  the  prisoners  of  war  to  be  guarded  by  the  Montreal  Militia  alone.  The  line

42  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAI,. 

"  It  unforiuiialely  proved  rather  late  in  the  evening  for  tlie  vast  concourse  ofspac- 
ators  assembled  to  experience  the  gratification  they  so  anxiously  looked  for.  This  incon- 
venience w  ts,  however,  in  a  great  measure  remedied  by  the  illumination  of  the  streets 
through  which  the  line  of  march  passed.  When  they  arrived  at  the  Governor's  house, 
the  General  was  conducted  in  and  presented  to  His  Excellency  Sir  George  Prevost. 
He  was  received  with  the  greatest  politeness,  and  invited  to  take  up  his  residence 
there  during  his  stay  in  Montreal.  The  officers  were  quartered  in  Holmes'  Hotel, 
and  the  soldiers  were  marched  to  the  Quebec  Gale  Barracks.  The  General  appears 
to  be  about  sixty  years  of  age,  and  bears  his  misfortune  with  a  degree  of  resignation 
that  but  few  men  in  similar  circumstances  are  fitted  with." 

Some  days  after,  the  pri.soners  started  for  Quebec  under  a  guard  of  Militia,  com- 
manded by  Major  Shakelton.  General  Hull  had  in  the  meantime  been  exclianged  at 
Montreal  for  thirty  British  prisoners  taken  in  the  hands  of  the  Americans,  and  all  the 
United  States  Militia  taken  prisoners  at  Detroit  had  been  sent  home. 

On  the  morning  of  the  19th  of  November  following,  the  drums  were  heard  all 
over  Montreal,  calling  the  Militia  to  muster,  as  an  attack  was  to  be  made  on  the  city 
by  another  invasion  of  the  American  Army.  The  sununons  was  speedily  obeyed. 
Hundreds  of  Militia  men,  F^nglish  and  French,  hastened  to  the  call,  and  with  deter- 
mined resolution  fell  into  their  tanks  and  marched  away  to  meet  the  unseen  foe.  But 
it  seems  that  it  was  a  false  alarm,  for,  after  nine  days'  anxious  wailing  and  witching 
(the  alarm  either  was  a  false  one  or  the  enemy  had  jjrudently  retired),  the  Montreal 
Militia  returned  to  the  city  in  the  morning  of  the  2Sth.  They  called  it  "  their  pleasant 
trip."  as  we  find  in  the  pajiers  of  the  day. 

And  who  were  the  Militia  ?  Who  were  they  who  ventured  their  lives  to  protect 
their  city  and  their  homes?  Let  their  names  be  ever  honored.  Many  of  them  the 
following  year  actually  met  the  same  enemy  at  Chateauguay,  and  proved  that  they 
were  worthy  of  their  sires. 

Let  it  be  always  remembered  that  Montreal  was  the  great  objective  i)oinl  of  the 
American  War  of  i.Sia-r^.  One  of  their  greatest  men  of  that  era,  their  Secre- 
tary of  State,  had  .said,  "That  Montreal  was  the  apple  of  his  eye.  Why  waste  men 
and  money  ujjon  distant  frontiers  ?  strike  at  the  vitals,  then  you  will  paralyze  the 
extremities.  Capture  Montreal  and  you  st.irvo  de  Rottenburg  and  Proctor,  In 
Montreal  your  troops  will  find  winter  quarters  and  iMiglish  Christmas." 

These  counsels  carried  great  weight,  and  we  know  from  History  that  the  re- 
mainder of  the  campaign,  viz.,  the  capture  of  Montreal,  was  the  grand  and  crowning 
object  of  American  strategy.  To  forward  this  plan  the  United  States  soo',  collected 
a  large  force  on  Lake  Champlain,  In  the  summer  of  1S13,  about  6,000  men  were 
collected  at  Burlington  and  Plattsburg. 

During  all  this  time,  and  for  the  past  year,  drilling  had  gone  on  incessantly  in 
Montreal.  Men  of  all  ranks  and  nationalities  eagerly  pressed  for  service.  To  the 
honor  of  our  forefathers  we  must  give  the  names  of  the  officers  at  least  who  com- 
posed these  volunteer  corps,  determined  to  defend  their  country  with  their  lives,

44  HISTORY  OK  MONTREAL. 

We  now  come  to  the  Corps  of  Canadian  Volfii^e  iirs,  of  whom  Brevet  Lt. -Col- 
onel Charles  DeSalaberry  was  the  "  Commandant  and  Superintendent."  IVie  Crf/- 
/a///A  were  Joseph  K.  Perrault,  J.  B.  Jucliereau  Diichesnay,  M.  L.  Juchcreau  Duches- 
nay,  BL-njamin  Kcuyer,  J.  B.  Herlel  l)e  Rouville,  Jacques  Viger  and  Jacques  Clement 
Herse.  7'/ic  itt  Lieutenants  were  Jaccpies  Adhemar,  Narcissi.-  Diichesnay,  VA. 
Lewis  Prendergast,  John  McKay,  Henry  Tiioinas,  Thomas  Place.  Charles  D'Estimau- 
ville  and  Daniel  De  Herlel.  T/ie  zntt  Lieutenants  were  William  Clarke,  .Simon 
Clarke,  I.oiiis  Cramer,  I,ouis  (iuy  and  Henry  Bouthillicr.  John  Kbden,  Adjutant; 
John  Porters,  Quarter-master  ;  Thos.  Place,  Paymaster;  P.  De  Sales  l,a  I'erriere, 
Surgeon  ;  Toussaint  C.  Truteau,  Assistant  Surgeon. 

In  the  Troop  of  Cavalry  for  Montreal,  George  Plait  was  Captain  ;  Robert  Gilles- 
pie, Lieutenant  :  and  John  Molson,  Cornel.  \n  the  Companv  of  Guides.  Jos.  Ignace 
Heberl  was  Ca|)tain  and  Constant  Cartier,   Lieutenant. 

So  by  degrees  Montreal  became  the  focus  or  centre  of  American  strategy.  It 
was  to  be  in  its  capture  and  pillage  an  atonement  for  Hull's  dellMt  at  Detroit ;  but  man 
proi)oses  and  God  disposes,  (ieneral  Hampton,  with  his  .American  arm),  on  the  21st 
of  Gctobcr,  1813,  moved  his  forces  direct  and  on  to  the  Canadian  frontier.  .About  four 
]).  m.  that  afiernopn  their  advanced  guard  drove  m  the  Canadian  advanced  vide'ttes. 
These  videttes  were  about  ten  miles  t'rom  Chateauguay  church,  (jenernl  de  Watte- 
ville  being  notitied  of  this,  instantly  ordered  up  iwo  companies  of  the  5th  Incorporated 
Mihlia,  under  the  cuumiand  nf  Capts.  Levesipie  and  Debartzcli,  and  200  men  of  the 
Beauharnois  Militia.  Advancing  about  two  leagues  or  six  nules,  liiey  at  night  halted 
al  the  confines  of  a  thick  wootl.  When  morning  came  ihey  were  joined  by  Colonel 
DeSalaberry  with  his  Voltigeurs  and  Captain  I'erguson's  Light  Company  of  the 
Canadian  Kencibles.  DeSalaberry  thus  reinforced  pushed  on  for  three  miles,  and 
on  the  left  i)ank  of  the  river  came  up  wiili  the  isl  patrol  of  the  eiu.my.  l"&gt;xpecting 
that  iieie  or  in  this  vicinity  there  would  be  the  meeting  of  ihe  invaders  and  Cana- 
dians, he  h.id  some  weeks  before  reconnt)itered  the  locality,  and  peifeclly  knew 
from  his  own  observation  the  whole  course  of  the  River  Chaleauguay  in  this  district, 
and  found  that  no  place  ])resented  a  better  position.  The  thick  forest  was  cut  by 
ravines,  and  a  great  swamp  was  on  the  right.  On  four  of  these  ravines  he  threw  up 
stro  ig  breastworks.  The  first  three  lines  he  placed  distant  about  200  yards 
ol  eacii  other.  The  fourth  was  juslone  mile  in  tiie  rear,  but  this  was  iin|)orlant,  for  it 
commanded  a  ford  by  which  the  enemy  tVom  the  right  bank  might  have  got  to  his 
rear.  This  was  the  most  important  place.  Almost  all  the  day  they  were  employed 
in  strengthening  their  breastworks,  Finally  the  right  bank  of  the  river  was  strictly 
guarded  by  sixty  men  of  the  Beauharnois  .Nfiliiia.  DeSalaberry  also  sent  a  well- 
armed  party  of  thirty  men  (axe  men)  to  destroy  every  bridge  within  five  miles  of  his 
front.  His  great  strategy  was  in  throwing  (uit  a  formidable  abattis  of  trees,  with 
their  branches  lying  outward  across  the  full  line  of  advance,  and  about  a  mile  distant, 
thus  rendering  the  American  artillery  of  ten  guns  perfectly  useless,  as  they  could  not 
be  brought  into  action.  'I'o  DeSalaberry  alone  must  be  credited  the  choice  of  the 
ground  and  the  dispositions  made. 


HISTORY   OF    MONTREAL.  45 

The  General,  on  the  22nd,  visited  all  the  lines,  and  entirely  approved  of  every- 
thing. All  the  23rd  and  24th  were  employed  in  strengthennig  the  positions,  piling 
up  trees,  forming  the  abattis  still  larger,  and  doing  everything  that  could  be  done 
to  render  the  i)osition  safe  ;  and  now  the  morning  of  the  25th  arrives,  and  about  ten 
a.m.,  the  sun  shining  brightly  down  through  the  open  vistas  in  the  forest,  and  reveal- 
ing a  sturdy  band  of  Canadians,  every  man  at  the  attention,  de,termined  to  sell  his 
life  for  hearth  and  home,  the  American  skirmishers  opened  fire  on  the  abattis.  After 
a  sharp  exchange  of  muskets,  tiiose  employed  by  DeSalaberry  as  laborers,  augment- 
ing the  strength  of  tlie  abattis,  fell  back,  covered  by  the  i)icket  of  the  Canadian 
Volligeurs.  As  soon  as  DeSalaberry  heard  the  firing  he  rode  up  from  the  front  line 
of  defence,  and  brought  with  him  three  companies  of  the  Canadian  Fencibles,  who 
deployed  immediately  on  the  right  rear  of  the  abattis.  He  aho  extended  Captain 
Duchesnay's  company  on  the  left,  while  the  company  of  Captain  Juchereau  Duches 
nay  occupied  a  position  on  the  left  rear  among  the  trees. 

Those  who  know  the  course  of  the  River  Chaleauguay  know  th:it  here,  at  this 
point,  the  river  makes  a  considerable  curve  or  bend.  Nothing  could  be  better  tlinn 
this  point  for  the  defenders.  DeSalaberry  knew  this,  and  saw  at  once  by  his  position 
that  their  fire  flanked  the  ford  in  support  of  the  fire  in  front. 

While  these  arrangements  were  being  made,  and  the  Canadians  were  put 
into  i)osition  by  the  intrepid  Commander,  the  enemy  had  debouched  from  the  woods 
into  a  large  open  space  in  front  of  the  abattis.  They  amounted  to  between  3,000  and 
3,500  men  with  three  scjuadrons  of  cavalry  and  four  guns.  Then  they  advanced  in 
columns  close  to  the  abattis,  but  by  doing  so  exposing  their  head  to  the  fire  in  front, 
and  their  flank  to  the  Indians  and  tirailleurs  in  the  bush  and  swamp. 

Now  came  the  crisis.  An  American  officer  rode  out  of  the  ranks  forward  to  the 
rear  of  the  abattis,  and  began  to  harangue  the  troops  in  front.  DeSalaberry  seized  a 
musket  from  the  nearest  soldier,  aimed  fire,  and  the  .American  would-be  Demosthenes 
threw  up  his  aims  and  fell  from  his  horse  a  dead  man.  At  the  same  moment,  the 
(Canadian  bugles  sounded  the  order  to  fire,  and  a  blaze  of  musketry  belched  forth 
from  the  abattis  and  the  swamps,  full  on  the  head  of  the  American  line.  It  halted, 
paused  for  a  moment,  made  a  turn  then  to  the  left,  formed  line  and  began  to  pour  in 
a  vigorous  fiisilade.  but  of  no  avail,  as  their  fire  was  thrown  into  the  wood  where  it 
did  little  or  no  execvition.  Jiut  their  vigorous  fire  on  the  right  com])elled  all  the 
Canadian  pickets  to  re' ire  within  the  abattis.  Mistaking  this  movement  on  the  part 
of  the  pickets  to  flight,  the  Americans  raised  a  great  shout,  l.)Ut  it  was  returned  with 
interest  by  the  w.cu  within  the  abattis.  While  both  side-^  were  thus  huzzaing, 
DeSalaberry  ordered  all  his  bugles  to  sound  and  pretend  tliat  his  forces  were  far  more 
numerous  than  they  really  were.  This  ruse  acted  completely.  After  a  time  their  fire 
slackened,  but  they  never  placed  their  foot  upon  or  within  the  Canadian  abattis. 

Thus  went  it  on.  here  and  at  other  points,  attack  and  defence,  and  when  from  a 
high  stump  the  Canadian  Commander  beheld  his  friend  Daly  with  his  company  of  the 
5th  Incorporated  boldly  plunge  into  the  river,  and  shoulder  to  shoulder  stem  both  the

water  and  the  enemy,  whom  they  thrust  back  on  reaching  the  other  side,  he  gave 
words  of  encouragement  to  him  and  his  men.  Uut  overpowered  by  numbers,  and 
the  well-sustained  fire  of  the  enemy,  he  was  over-matched,  and  slowly  fell  back.  He 
had  been  wounded  in  that  glorious  advance  of  the  5th  when  crossing  the  river,  ami 
while  retiring  and  faint  from  loss  of  blood,  encouraging  his  men,  he  received  a  second 
wound  and  fell.  Capt.  Jiruyere  also  was  wounded  and  fell.  Slowly,  and  like  a  lion 
at  bay,  they  receded  step  by  step  under  command  of  Lieutenant  Schiller,  and  so  close 
to  the  enemy  ihat  they  heard  (hard  thing  to  bear)  the  shouts  and  jeers  of  the 
American  soldiers.  Litile  did  they  think  that  they  were  being  drawn  into  an 
ambuscade.  Suddenly  they  became  exposed  to  a  crushing  fire  in  flank,  which 
arrested  their  march  and  threw  them  into  total  and  utter  confusion.  \'ain  was  the 
attempt  to  rally,  they  broke  and  scrambled  back  into  the  bush  ;  and  thus  the 
Canadian  Militia  slept  that  night  on  the  field  of  Chateauguay.  Gen.  Hampton  with- 
drew his  forces.  Many  prisoners  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  Canadians.  They  found  on 
the  way  of  advance  next  day,  muskets,  knapsacks,  drums,  and  all  kinds  of  provisions. 
No  less  than  forty  dead  bodies  were  interred  by  them,  and  many  graves  were  seen — 
notably  two  of  American  officers  of  distinction  who  had  fallen  in  the  tight. 

All  did  their  duty  well  and  nobly  that  day,  but  let  especial  mention  be  made  of  Cap- 
tains Ferguson,  de  P)artzch  and  Levesque,  Capt.  I-'Kcuyerand  the  two  Duchesnays» 
(Captains  Daly,  Bruyere  and  Lamothe,  who  handled  his  Indian  warriors  well,  1-ieuls. 
Pinguet,  Guy.  Johnson,  Powell,  Hebben  and  Schiller — all  displayed  courage  and 
vigor.  Capls.  I.cjngtin  and  Huneau  were  examples  to  their  men.  Capi.  l.ongtin 
did,  as  the  Ironsides  of  Kngland  under  Cromwell  were  accustomed  to  do.  li  is  re- 
lated of  him  diat  before  the  battle  he  knelt  down  at  the  head  of  his  company  and 
offered  a  short  but  earnest  prayer.  "  And  now,  mes  enfans,"  he  said,  rising,  "  having 
done  our  duty  to  God,  we  will  do  the  same  by  our  king." 

Last,  but  not  the  least,  stand  out  the  names  of  the  "  simple  soldats,"  Vincent^ 
Pel/eticr,  Vcrvais,  Dubois  wnd  Caron,  all  of  the  Voltigeurs,  who,  in  the  face  of  diffi- 
culties, danger  and  death,  swam  the  River  Chateauguay  and  cut  off  ihe  retreat  of  the 
prisoners,  who  were  taken,  amounting  to  near  a  score.  All  honor  be  10  them  too. 
Let  their  names  for  ever  be  remembered  in  the  hearts  of  all  Canadians,  whether  they 
be  French  or  Knglish  speaking  I  doubt  not  but  the  same  "  esprit  de  corps,"'  the 
same  love  of  country,  fills  the  hearts  of  nine-tenths  of  our  people  to-day  ;  and  if  neces 
sity  came  (which  may  God  avert),  the  same  courage  and  pluck  as  seen  in  the 
volunteers  of  1812-13  would  be  displayed  ii»  those  of  1892  and  following  years. 

Here  arc  some  interesting  items  which  are  picked  out  fr()m  an  old  Almanac  of 
A.D.  181 3,  printed  at  (Quebec.  They  will  shew  the  great  changes  which  have  taken 
place  in  Montreal  since  I  lie  days  of  ihe  last  war  between  Canada  and  the  United 
Slates.  Many  old  and  well-known  names  are  also  recorded  worth  remembering,  as 
many  of  our  streets,  squares  and  avenues  arc  still  called  after  then).  The  [)rii\ter

DOCTORS    AND    DENTISTS. 

We  now  come  to  the  Doctors,  and  we  find  that  the  whole  number  in  the  city  was 
ten,  and  in  the  country  (district  of  Montreal)  thirty.  The  city  names  are  :  Cieo.  Selby, 
Hy.  Loedel,  Joiin  Rowand,  ]''.  H.  Bender,  Daniel  Arnoldi,  lienj.  Green,  Grant  Pow- 
ell, D.  T.  Kennelly,  Abner  Rice  and  Rene  Kimbert.  At  the  jtresenl  day  not  one 
of  these  names  appears  on  our  medical  list  :  the  families  have  become  extinct,  or  have 
left  the  city.  Among  the  country  doctors  there  are  some  well-known  names,  which 
afterwards  figured  in  Canadian  History,  such  as  Henry  Munro,  Wm.  D.  Selby,  Simon 
F&gt;aser,  Henry  Carter,  Wolfred  Nelson  and  Samuel  Newcombe.  The  last  two  were 
well  known  in  the  Rebellion  of  1837-8.  Then  besides  the  doctors  there  were  the 
apothecaries.  There  are  only  three  :  A.  Lyman,  George  AVadsworth  and  Moses 
Nichols.

A  pei  iiliar  title  was  ^iven  to  doctwis  alxjut  this  time  in  connection  with  this 
name.  In  an  old  account  of  a  trial  now  in  the  virchivcs  of  the  Court  House,  there  is 
a  i)hysician  called  .\\e\.  Spence,  who  is  dcsi^Miated  accarhen  and  man-midwife,  This 
seems  to  htve  been,  in  legal  parlance,  the  designation  at  the  beginning  of  this 
century. 

\\\  the  Customs,  N.  H.  Percival  was  collector ;  Hugh  McDonald,  tidesman  ;  ^Vnl^ 
Lindsay,  collector  at  St.  Johns  :  W  m.  McCrae.  ganger  at  same  i)lace  ;  and  Hugh 
O'Hara,  deputy  collector.

29  tons. 

\Ve  now  come  to  the  militia  and  military  then  in  Canada.  In  the  4th  Co.  of 
voluiurcrs,  of  the  1st  Uattalion  .Militia  of  .Montreal,  we  find  I'.  Caldwell,  major,

We  now  (  ome  to  the  ecclesiastical  stale  of  Canada,  which  shows  a  startling 
advance  since  those  early  days.  In  the  whole  provinces  of  Upper  and  Lower  Canada 
there  were  only  thirteen  clergymen  of  the  Church  of  Lngiand  and  three  of  the  Church 
of  Scotland.  There  is  not  one  Methodist,  Baptist  or  Congregational  minister  given. 
Rer.  Dr.  Mountain  was  rector  of  Christ's  Church,  Montreal,  and  Rev.  Mr.  Soiner- 
ville  was  the  Presbyterian  clergyman  in  the  city.  'J'here  were  ;d)Out  twenty-two  or 
twenty-four  Roman  Catholic  priests  in  the  city  then.  Schoolmasters  were  more 
plentiful  than  clergy,  no  less  than  eighteen  English  teachers  being  then  in  the  Province 
of  Lower  Canada.  Finley  Fisher  is  tlie  teacher  for  Montreal,  and  we  find  Mr, 
Nelson  at  William  Henry  (now  Sorel),  Mr.  Baker  at  Durham,  Rev.  Mr.  Wilkie, 
(,&gt;uebec.  with  Mr.  Thoni  and  Mr.  Sprat. 

The  greatest  quantity  of  wiieal  ever  exported  from  Canada  up  to  the  date  of  this 
Almanac  was  in  1802.  it  amounted  to  1,010,033  bushels.  There  were  besides 
exported  that  year  28,301  bbls.  of  flour  and  22,051  cwt.  of  biscuit. 

It  may  be  interesting  to  know  that  our  esteemed  fellow-citizen.  Mr.  W.  W, 
Ogilvie,  and  Senator  Ogilvie's  gtattdfather,  was  the  first  man  who  exported  flour  from 
Canada,  and  in  this  year  1802  ;  in  the  previous  one  1801  he  had  come  from  Scotland 
to  Quebec,  and  started  a  flour  mill  at  Jacques  Cartier  near  Quebec,  and  this  same 
year  opened  up  one  at  Lachine.  What  a  difference  now  !  Last  year  his  grandson 
exported  from  Manitoba  over  7,000,000  bushels.

HISTORY    OF    MONTREAL. 


New  ships  5896  tons  weight  were  built  in  tlie  province  in  tlie  year  1813.  iJroad 
and  beef  continue  much  about  the  same  as  then.  IJread  (luoled  at  a}^d.  per  lb.,  and 
beef  5d.  Lastly,  when  Montreal  was  not  one-tifth  the  size  that  it  is  now,  there  were 
four  members  of  Parliament  allowed.  \V^hy  not  reorganize  and  give  the  wealthiest  and 
largest  City  of  the  Dominion  her  just  rights  as  regards  parliamentary  representation  ? 
She  Avould  now  have  at  least  12  members  m  proportion  to  the  4  of  1813. 

It  may  be  worth  while  here  to  write  about  tiie  Montreal  of  this  period — 1815-16. 
These  ret.ords  are  generally  taken  fiom  a  paper  by  the  late  J.  H.  Dorwin,  whicii 
appeared  in  the  67(/r.  and  are  very  correct,  as  lie  was  an  eye-witness  to  all  he  speaks 
about :  "  Viger  Garden  was  a  swamp,  and  from  this  swamp  a  sluggish  creek  or  ditch 
ran  south-westerly  along  what  is  now  Craig  street,  past  the  east  end  of  St.  Xntoine 
street, makinga  turn  at  Dow's  Brewery,  coming  east  through  the  Priest'sCarden  across 
McCill  street  at  St.  Ann's  market  and  into  the  river,  where  the  Custom  House  now 
stands.  Its  lower  course  was  at  least  twenty  feet  deep,  allowing  canoes  in  times  of 
high  water  to  come  up  \u  McCiill  street.  ( )ver  its  banks  was  thrown  all  t'e  lillii  and 
refuse  of  the  city,  to  be  washed  away  once  a  year  hy  the  sprnig  freshets.  It  was 
crossed  by  four  bridges,  over  which  ran  roads  into  the  country.  In  the  bed  of  this 
creek  is  now  Craig  street  umnel,  the  main  sewer  of  the  city. 

"  .\bout  where  St.  Louis  street  now  is  was  a  small  deep  pond,  the  lesort  n\'  musk 
rats  and  walcrluwl.  IJeiween  Bonsecours  street  and  St.  Mary  was  '  Citadel  Hill,' 
sixty  feet  high,  occupied  l)y  the  military,  having  on  its  summit  a  large  block  house, 
where  cannon  were  fired  at  sunrise  and  at  noon,  and  a  sentry  jxaced  constantly.  I'he 
eastern  portion  of  this  hill,  where  Dalhousie  s([uare  is  now.  was  removed  in  1812  to 
construct  the  plateau  of  the  ('hamp  de  .Mars,  and  in  1819  the  remainder,  between 
lionsecours  stteet  and  the  square,  was  taken  to  fill  up  ,ind  le\el  off  the  pond  just 
mentioned.  Mr.  Dorwin  was  one  of  the  &lt;  oniractoi'-  in  the  latter  removal,  and  e.irii)  to 
the  dei)th  of  55  leet  was  taken  from  where  the  old  Donegani  Hotel  stands,  a,iid  St. 
Mary  street  was  thus  joined  with  Notre  Dame.  There  was  a  tradition  among  the 
old  settlers  that  the  hill  had  originally  been  built  with  material  tlug  from  the  pond 
but  this  was  disproved  by  the  disclosure  through  it  of  the  natural  strata  and  layers 
of  earth,  (in  tlie  side  of  the  hill  next  the  pond  were  found  several  coflins,  some  of 
them  well  preserved.  The  coroner  was  notitied  .  hut  inste;.d  ot  holding  a  long  judi. 
( ial  and  scientifn:  investigation,  he  ordeied  them  to  be  tumbled  into  the  [)oiul  with 
the  rest  of  the  earth.  Cnder  the  block-house  on  the  summit  was  found  a  huin.m 
skeleton  wrapjjcd  in  the  remains  of  an  old  blanket. 

"  five  roads,  corresponding  to  St.  Mary. St.  l.awienre.  St.  .Antoiue,  St.  Joseph  and 
Wellington  streets,  riii  out  ctf  the  ( il\  tf)  the  country,  four  of  them  ])assing  through 
groups  of  houses  forming  four  .sm.ill  suburbs 
^  "  'I'he  (^&gt;uebec  suburbs,  the  most  arisiixratic  locality  outside  the  city  limits,  con- 
sisted of  a  score  or  two  of  buildings,  mostly  small,  scattered  along  both  sides  of  St. 
Mary  street  from  a  gate  at  the  east  end  of  St.  Paul  street  to  beyond  Molson's  Brew- 
ery.    There  were  a  few  side  lanes,  the  (uillines  of  the  present  cross  streets,  and  the

]'apineaii  road  had  just  been  opened,  ihrough  which  the  habitants  from  the  country 
U)  tlie  nortli  and  east  began  to  pass  as  the  shortest  way  to  market.  On  the  right 
hand  passing  down  were  the  three  fine  stone  residences  of  Bishop  Mountain,  Judge 
Rcid  and  Baron  (rrant,  all  now  standing,  the  last  afterwards  bought  by  William 
Molson.  Molson's  Brewery  stood  then  as  now,  and  a.  short  distance  beyond  was  a 
toruidry  carried  on  by  the  large  firm  of  Allison,  Turner  cV'  Co.  Between  the  two  was 
a  shipyard,  the  only  one  then  in  the  place,  where  a  shipbuilder  named  Johnson  built 
vessels  for  Mr.  James  Miller  ;  and  below  the  foundry  was  ihe  fine  country  residence 
of  the  Hon.  Joim  Kichardson,  the  prime  mover  in  the  digging  of  the  I&gt;achine  canal. 
In  liochelaga  were  a  few  farm-houses  and  a  tavern  or  two. 

"  St.  Lawrence  suburb,  the  most  populous  of  the  four,  ccjmmenced  at  a  bridge 
over  the  creek,  at  the  foot  of  St.  Lawrence  street.  Tliis  street,  as  fiir  up  as  where 
Ontario  now  intersects,  was  quite  thickly  lined  witii  small  low  wooden  buildings. 
Above  Sherbrooke  street,  before  reaching  the  Mile  End  tavern,  there  were  but  two 
houses,  both  of  stone,  and  on  the  left  side  (jf  the  street,  then  belonging  to  John  Clark 
and  now  the  property  of  the  Bagg  estate.  Slierbrooke  street  was  liien  opened  from 
St.  Lawrence  street  about  as  far  west  as  ]&gt;leurv.  In  r.SiQ  two  fine  residence^  were 
built  on  this  street,— one  by  Jacol&gt;  Hall  and  the  other  i)y  Torrance.  They  were  both 
prominent  objects  to  the  citizens  below,  and  the  latter,  being  the  only  cut-stone 
structure  outside  the  main  city,  was  the  admiration  of  every  passer-by.  It  is  now 
the  residence  of  the  Molson  family.  To  the  west,  •  The  Towers,'  still  well  pre- 
served, had  even  then  been  standing  for  over  a  hunilred  years,  and  are  [)rol)ably  the 
oldest  buildings  in  Montreal.  A  fool  bridge  crossed  the  creek  at  Bleury  street, 
and  a  narrow  lane  ran  up  about  as  far  as  Dorchester  street,  along  which  straggled 
abou.  half  a  dozen  small  liouses.  This  was  called  •  Flirtation  Lane,' and  was  a 
favorite  promenade  for  romantic  couples  during  the  long  twilight  of  the  sunmier 
evenings, 

"  St.  Antoine  sid)urbs  began  at  a  I)ridge  crossing  the  creek  at  the  east  end  of  Si;. 
Antoine  street,  and  was  a  road  with  seveial  cross  lanes  pretty  ilosely  built  up  is  far 
west  as  Mountain  street.  There  was  only  one  first-class  house,  that  of  Norman  .V. 
McLeod,  a  rich  '  North-Wester,'  or  member  of  the  Norlh-AN'est  Company.  The  chief 
\\u\u  of  tiii:^  company,  tlie  lion.  \Vm.  .McCillivray,  had  a  fine  stone  residence  in  Cote 
St.  Antoine,  about  the  end  ot  Dorchester  street,  the  most  magnificent  building  m  the 
whole  city,  attrrwards  owned  l)y  the  Hon.  (Sharks  \\'iUon.

'•(  )ver  the  creek  at  Dow's  Ihtuery  was  a  third  l)ridgc  crossed  by  the  Upper 
L.achine  road  ;  at  the  foot  of  McCill  street,  near  St.  Ann's  market,  was  a  fourth,  over 
which  ran  the  Lower  Lachine  road,  both  roails  much  travelled  in  those  ante-canal 
days.  Beyond  the  latter  bridge  the  drey  Nun  road  led  down  to  the  water.  At 
Bointe  Calliere  the  Crey  Numiery  tlien  stood,  and  a  little  farther  west  were  three  wind- 
mills.    West  of  this,  in  what  rejoiced  in  the  name  oi  '  St.  .\mi  subur!)s,'  were  seven

buildings  scattered  confusedly  over  the  common,  and  other  than  the  Lachine  road 
not  even  an  attempt  at  street-making.  The  nearest  buildings  were  H.  \:  R.  Corse's 
dwelling  and  linseed  oil  faclory.  Thomas  McCord  had  a  block  house  near  the 
Canal  Basin,  and  William  Forbes  lived  in  a  two-storey  Yankee  house  near  the  corner 
of  King  and  Wellington  streets.  Robert  Oriffin,  from  whom  Griffintown  took  its 
name,  had  a  soap  factory  near  the  latter  street,  and  away  west  the  Gregory  house 
was  standing  called  '  Woodlands  '  then  ;  a  fine  stone  house  was  standing  with  polar 
trees  around  it,  owned  by  Gregory,  a  '  North-Wester.'  A  little  btyond  was  Chap- 
man's Brewery,  ^[uch  of  the  land  around  was  then  a  swamp,  flooded  during  the 
spring  freshets  and  wet  seasons. 

"  Point  .St.  (.'harles  was  a  common.  Beaver  Hall  Hill  was  a  field  with  a  long  low 
wooden  building  at  its  fool  called  '  Krobisher's  '  house.  The  mountain  was  cov- 
ered u'ith  trees,  and  h;id  on  it  McTavish's  monument  and  unfinished  house.  All  the 
rest  of  the  country  round  not  before  mentioned,  now  cut  uj)  by  miles  and  miles  of 
streets,  lined  with  the  I.K-st  residences  of  the  city,  was  then  orchards,  gardens  and 
open  fields,  dolled  Ikmo  and  there  wilh  farm  houses.

"  Mt)st  of  the  money  in  use  then  was  silver,  'i'he  C(jins  were  Spanish  dollars. 
Ireiich  half-crowns  valued  at  two  s'lillings  and  iiinepence,  pistareens  valued  at  one 
shilling,  and  sevenpence  ha!f-i)emiy  pieces.  The  only  paper  money  ever  seen  in  the 
country  were  army  bills  which  had  been  issued  by  the  Government  durii'.g  the  war,  and 
were  most  of  them  redeemed  shortly  after.  The  habitants,  not  being  able  to  read, 
would  not  lake  paper  money,  and  preferred  silver  coin,  perhai)s,  to  any  other.  Con- 
secjuently,  all  kinds  of  silver  coins,  depreciated  and  otherwise,  jjoured  into  the  coun- 
tr\  from  all  quarters,  and  ])assed  at  par  and  sometimes  above  it.  Half-crowns  and 
pistareens  were  worth  only  half  a  dollar  and  rycts.,  respectively,  in  Boston,  but  were 
brought  over  here  by  the  boxful  and  passed  at  the  above  quoted  values.  Si)ecula- 
lors  brought  over  large  (luanlities  of  American  half-dollars  and  exchanged  them  for 
army  bills,  which  were  at  a  heavy  discount  here,  look  lhe,army  bills  over  ihe' border 
and  sold  them  al  a  high  premium."' 

THK   KIRS'i'    C.WADIAN    HANK. 

In  the  .summer  of  1817  a  number  of  prominent  merchants  of  the  city,  after  hold- 
ing several  meetings,  formed  a  company  wilh  a  capital  of  $1,000,000  and  started  the 
Bank  of  Montreal.  They  had  no  charier,  for  in  those  days  the  obtaining  of  rights 
for  private  companies  was  a  very  dilVicult  and  tedious  undertaking,  as  after  the  neces- 
sary legislation  had  passed  the  Provincial  (Jovernment,  the  whole  matter  had  to  be 
sent  to  the  Ihitish  Governmenl  for  sanction.  It  was  a  great  pu/zle  to  the  Bank  how 
to  issue  bills  for  circulation  without  making  each  stockholder  personally  liable  for 
their  i)ayment,  but  at  last  the  f  illowing  form  for  the  reading  of  their  notes  was 
adopted : — 


HISTORY    OF    MONTREAL.  I  53 

"The  President  and  Directors  of  the  Bank  of  Montreal  promise  to  pay  A.  li.,  or  bearer,  the  sum 
ijf  live  dollars  (or  other  amount)  out  of  the  joint  funds  of  the  Association,  and  no  other." 

This  form  was,  of  course,  dropped  when  the  charter  was  obtained.  Several  years 
ago  one  of  these  old  notes  was  presented  as  payment  to  the  Metropolitan  Bank  of 
this  city.  John  Grey,  a  retired  dry  goods  merchant,  was  the  first  President  of  the 
Hank ;  Robert  Griffin,  the  lirst  Cashier.  The  directors  were  some  of  the  most  pro- 
minent business  men  of  the  city.  'I'hey  were  Hon.  John  Richardson,  Samuel  Gerard, 
Thomas  Thain,  Horatio  Gates,  George  Auldjo,  John  Molson,  Thomas  A.  Turner, 
William  Krmatinger.  /abdiel  Thayer  and  David  David.  On  the  ist  of  October,  1817, 
the  first  bank  note  ever  issued  in  Canada  was  issued  by  the  Montreal  Hank.  Not- 
withstanding the  prejudice  of  the  habitants  against  paper  money,  the  Bank  i)rospered 
until  r8?4,  when  Samuel  Gerard  was  made  President.  He.  by  his  mismanagement, 
had  lost  the  one-third  of  its  capital  by  1S27.  John  Molson  then  became  President, 
and  tlie  losses  were  redeemed  in  a  few  years,  but  for  five  years  at  that  time  tiie  Bank 
[)aid  no  dividend.  It  occupied  for  the  first  few  years  of  its  existence  a  small  building 
in  St.  Paul  Street,  and  then  moved  into  a  much  hirger  one  in  St,  James  Street. 

ANOTHER  BANK. 

In  181S  the  r.ank  of  Canada  was  started  by  a  few  wealthy  individuals,  who  were 
dissatisfied  witli  the  directorship  of  the  Bank  of  Montreal.  Thomas  H.  Tunier  was 
['resident,  and  Robert  Armour,  Cashier.  There  was  not  room  for  two  banks,  how- 
e\'er,  and  the  inlluence  of  its  rival  was  too  powerful,  so  it  died  in  a  few  years,  and  fell 
into  the  hands  of  two  firms — H.  Gates  i^  ('o.  and  Wm.  J'eddie  \'  Co.,  wlio  wound 
up  its  affairs  without  any  loss  to  the  stockholders.  Many  persons  have  a  belief  that 
such  an  institution  as  the  "  Bank  of  Canada  "  never  existed,  so  for  liicir  Itettei  con- 
vincement  the  following  business  notice  has  been  clip[)ed  from  the  Canadian  Courant 
of  May  13,  1S20  :

These  advertisements  occur  weekly  through  the  (?(///«&lt;//(?//  Courant  for  1820,  side 
by  side  with  similar  announcements  of  the  liank  of  Montreal. 

WHAl"  IT  COST  TO  SEND  LEITERS. 

The  mail  system  of  that  lime  was  a  part  of  the  English  Postal  Service,  and  the 
Province  had  no  voice  in  the  matter.  Tiie  Montreal  Post  (Jftice  was  a  room  about 
twelve  feet  sipiare  in  St.  Sulpice  Street,  near  St.  Paul.  There  were  no  letter-boxes  ; 
it  was  all  "  general  delivery  "  in  its  crudest  form.  The  few  letters  lay  scattered  about 
on  a  table,  and  had  all  to  be  looked  over  at  each  application  at  the  door.     Very  few 


54  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL. 

letters  came  or  went ;  the  mail  to  Upper  Canada  was  weekly,  and  the  seven  days'  col- 
lection could  be  contained  in  one  small  mail-bag.  That  to  Quebec  was  oftener  and 
larger.  The  English  mail,  carried  in  sailing  vessels,  arrived  during  the  summer  at 
periods  of  from  a  month  and  a  half  to  three  months  apart.  In  winter  it  came  by  New 
York  and  was  longer  on  the  way.  Postage  was  very  dear,  about  gd.  to  Quebec,  5d. 
to  St.  John,  IS.  6d.  to  western  part  of  Upper  Canada,  and  is.  6d.  to  the  Lower  Pro- 
vinces. In  1820  there  appeared  in  the  various  newspapers  an  official  advertisement 
signed  by  a  member  of  the  English  Postal  Service,  giving  a  list  of  reduced  rates 
between  Canada  and  many  foreign  countries,  the  postage  on  a  letter  to  the  various 
countries  of  Western  Europe  varying  from  3s.  lod.  to  4s  4d.  There  were  no  money 
letters,  for  indeed  there  was  no  money  in  a  form  convenient  for  sending  thus.  The 
recipient  of  a  letter  paid  all  the  postage  except  in  cases  where  it  crossed  the  United 
States  boundary,  when  the  sender  paid  as  far  as  the  lines.  There  was  much  private 
mail  carrying  both  for  pay  and  free.  Anyone  travelling  to  the  United  States  or  Upi)er 
Canada  was  exj^ected  to  fill  half  his  baggage  with  letters  and  various  articles  for  per- 
sons there. 

THE    NEWSPAPER  PRESS. 

There  were  three  English  newspapers  piib'ished  in  Montreal  in  181 6,  the  Gazette, 
Herald,  and  CanaJiini  Cotuant.  I'liere  was  no  French  paper.  The  Gazette, 
started  in  1778,  was  at  the  time  of  which  we  are  writing  owned  and  printed  by  James 
Brown  in  a  small  wooden  building  which  has  been  before  spoken  of,  standing  on  the 
corner  of  St.  Francois  Xavier  and  Notre  Dame  Streets.  The  Herald  had  been 
started  in  iSoQby  a  man  named  Kay.  The  Canadian  Coiirant,  established  in  1807 
by  Nahum  Mower,  was  still  conducted  by  hi n  in  a  small  building  in  St.  Paul  Street 
in  1820,  and  was  perhaps  then  tlie  most  influential  and  widely  read  of  the  three. 
Mower,  however,  was  the  life  of  it,  for  when  he  died  it  died  shortly  after  him.  in  1833. 
A  glance  at  its  pages  for  1820  shows  that  it  was  conducted  with  considerable  ability. 
The  local  columns  were  well  filled  and  well  written  ;  the  many  abuses  of  the  time 
were  denounced,  and  necessary  improvements  advocated.  The  European  intelligence, 
the  most  imjiortant  part  of  which  in  1820  concerned  the  trial  of  Queen  Caroline,  was 
about  two  months  behind  time.  The  Canadian  Courant  was  published  twice  a 
week  in  1820,  and  its  advertising  columns  were  well  patronized.  Many  of  the  inser- 
tions there  would  now  be  called  unique  and  amusing.     Mere  is  a  sample  :

HKEl.LA  known  not  to  be  his  own:  he  is

find  the  owner's  name  marked  in  several  places 
with  a  pen,  and  to  l)ekind  enough  to  return  it.

WHAT  GOODS  USED  TO  COST. 

As  another  matter  for  comparison,  we  give  the  prices  of  a  few  staple  articles 
taken  from  the  market  price  list  in  the  Canadian  Courant  of  May,  20,  1820,  which 
are:  Beef,  .£2  los  per  bbl;  pork,  £4  to  £5  do;  flour,  £1  5s  to  £1  los  do;  coffee, £8 
to  £9  per  cwt;  sugar,  £3  to  £3  los  do;  butter,  best  quality  lod  per  lb;  tea,  4s  to 
8s  6d ;  tobacco,  6d  to  is  3d  do;  brandy,  4s  to  5s  per  gal;  coal,  £1  los  to  £1  15s 
per  chaldron.  All  these  articles  sold  at  a  mud;  iiigher  rate  during  and  shortly  after 
the  war. 

THE  MKRCHANT  PRINCES  OF   1816. 

The  principal  wholesale  firms  doing  business  in  Montreal  in  1816  were: 
McGillivray,  Thain  N:  Co.,  otherwise  called  the  "  North-West  Company;"  Korsythe, 
Richardson  «!t  Co.,  who  were  agents  East  India  Company;  Maitlands,  Carden  &amp; 
Auldjo  ;  (ierard,  Gillespie,  MofTiut  ^v:  Co.,  then  agents  I'hceni.x  Fire  Insurance  Co., 
of  London,  and  now  existing  as  Gillespie,  MofTatt  &lt;!^  Co.  ;  H.  Gates  iS:  Co.  ;  Allison, 
Turner  &lt;S:  Co.  :  Desrivieres,  Blackwood  lV  Co.  ;  Blackwood,  LaRofjue  &amp;  Co. ;  Rob- 
inson, Masson  (S:  Co. ;  Hector  Russel  &amp;  Co.,  also  retailing  fancy  dress  goods — the 
grer.t  retail  dry  goods  house  of  that  time;  Miller,  Parlane  &amp;  Co.  James  Miller  left 
the  firm  in  181 9  and  engaged  exclusively  in  shipbuilding,  and  was  really  the  founder 
of  the  Allan  line  of  steamships ;  James  McDougall  iV'  Co.,  merchants  and  brokers  ; 
Hart,  IvOgan  «S:  Co. ;  Geo.  Platl  N:  Co.,  hardware  ;  J.  &amp;  J.  M.  Frothingli.im,  hardware, 
now  existing  as  i-'rothingham  &lt;.V'  Workman  ;  J.  T.  Barrett,  hardware  ;  Jacob  DeWitt, 
hardware  ;  Lewis  Lyman,  druggist,  the  founder  of  the  present  house  of  Lyman,  Sons 
tV  Co.  ;  Day,  Gelston  ^^  Co.,  druggists,  Mr.  Day  being  the  father  of  the  late  Judge 
Day  ;  Wadsworth  &amp;  Nichols,  druggists  ;  Thomas  Torrance  and  John  Torrance,  both 
wholesale  and  retail  grocers  ;  Bowman  iV  Smith,  grocers  ;  Zabdiel  Thayer,  crockery  ;

auctioneers  ;  M.  C.  Cuvillier  cV  Co.,  do.,  and  Bridge  iV  Penn,  do.  Most  of  these 
firms  did  what  would  even  now  be  called  a  very  large  business,  and  many  of  the  men 
composing  them  were  reputed  wealthy.  The  possession  of  $25,000  in  those  days 
made  a  rich  man,  and  $100,000  a  very  wealthy  man. 

I  will  now  give  the  principal  events  of  the  Court  of  Ring's  and  Queen's  Bench  in 
a  tabulated  form  and  in  chronological  order,  beginning  A.D.  1812  to  the  Rebellion  of

Correction. 

Benefit  of  Clergy. 

It  was  an  ancient  privilege  allowed  to  the  Clergy  of  claiming  those  accused  of 
felony  to  be  delivered  up  to  the  ecclesiastical  judge — always  favorable  to  his  own 
order — for  compurgation,  instead  of  being  tried  in  the  ordinary  way  before  the  lay 
judges  of  the  land.     In  ancient  times  few  persons  except  those  in  Holy  Orders  could 


HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL.  57 

read,  and  accordingly  the  test  for  an  accused  person  claiming  benefit  of  Clergy  was 
his  ability  to  read.  If  he  could  not,  the  courts  would  not  part  with  the  defendant, 
but  proceed  to  try  him  as  if  he  were  a  layman.  Afterward,  when  education  became 
more  general,  other  persons  besides  Clergymen  were  able  to  read  ;  and  so,  in  the  reign 
of  Edward  III.,  Parliament  extended  the  privilege  of  Clergy,  as  it  is  called,  to  clerkly 
laymen  until  the  reign  of  Elizabeth,  Women  were  not  allowed  their  Clergy  until  the 
reign  of  William  and  Mary,  when  Parliament  extended  the  benefit  to  them.  In  the 
reign  of  Henry  VII.,  however,  a  blow  was  aimed  at  this  singular  privilege  as  enjoyed 
by  laymen,  and  a  statute  was  then  passed  against  "divers  persons  lettered,  wlio  have 
been  more  bold  to  commit  murders,  rapes,  robbery,  theft,  as  well  as  other  mischievous 
deeds,"  which  enacted  that  persons  "  not  within  Holy  Orders,"  accused  of  these 
offenses,  and  convicted  thereof,  were  in  cases  of  murder  to  be  marked  with  tlie  letter 
•'  M  "  on  the  brawn  of  the  left  thumb,  and  in  all  others  with  the  letter  "  T,"  to  denote, 
it  is  presumed,  that  the  person  had  been  guilty  of  theft.  In  cases  of  high  treason, 
benefit  of  Clergy  was  never  allowed  to  be  pleaded.  It  is  stated  that  when  an  accused 
person  claimed  his  Clergy  it  was  usual  to  test  his  learning  by  requesting  him  to  read 
the  first  verse  of  the  fifty-first  Psalm,  which  in  Latin  begins  with  the  words  •'  Miserere 
mei  Deus."  In  addition  to  the  extraordinary  character  of  tiiis  proceeding,  in  which 
a  touch  of  grim  humor  seems  perceptible,  its  absurdity  is  apparent,  for,  of  course,  men 
might  easily  have  coached  themselves  up  in  the  required  test.  The  ecclesiastical 
judge,  who  was  generally  the  Bishop,  might,  however,  have  given  the  defendant  any- 
thing else  to  read,  and,  in  either  case,  in  the  event  of  his  inability  to  comply,  might 
have  handed  him  over  to  the  law,  and  this  proceeding  generally  meant  death.  A 
custom  which  favored  criminals  solely  on  accoimt  of  their  good  education  appears  to 
us,  when  it  is  unjustly  thought  that  superior  intelligence  adds  a  stain  to  criminality  of 
any  kind,  to  be  in  the  highest  degree  absurd  ;  yet  we  are  told  by  able  writers  that  the 
benefit  of  Clergy  or  learning — for  "  clergy  "  is  here  tantamount  thereto — was  not  so 
ridiculous  as  it  seems.  Without  saying  more  on  the  subject,  it  may  be  stated  tiiat 
the  privilege  was  abolished  in  the  reign  of  George  IV.

J  will  now  give  an  example  of  the  order  which  the  military  authorities  issued  for 
the  punishment  of  Desertion. 

''  Sentence  awarded  against  private  Christ.  Smith,  No.  948  of  the  43rd  Regt. 

"To  be  transported  as  a  Felon  for  the  term  of  14  years,  and  further  to  1)e 
marked  with  the  letter  D  in  the  manner  prescribed  in  the  Mutiny  Act. 

"  N.  BooiH,  I..  Col.  43rd  Regt. 
"  Chambly,  Lower  Canada,  9  May,  1838." 

On  the  1 6th  May  the  following  paper  clearly  shows  that  the  soldiers  of  Her 
Majesty  then  stationed  in  the  Montreal  district  were  continually  on  the  part  of  some 
of  them  trying  to  escape  or  desert,  although  more  than  one  English  Historian  of  the 
present  period  states  that  not  a  single  soldier  deserted  during  the  period  of  1837-8-9. 

"Town  Major's  office,  Montreal,  15  May,  183S. 
"  Mr.  Wand, 

"  Will  have  the  goodness  to  receive  from  the  officer  of  the  34th  Regt.,  14  soldiers, 
deserters  under  sentence  of  transportation,  and  I  shall  be  at  the  gaol  this  evening, 
and  will  inform  Mr.  Wand  what  is  to  be  done  with  the  prisoners. 

'Colin  McDonald,  Town  Major," 


62  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL, 

On  the  nth  July,  three  soldiers  are  sentenced  thus:  Thos.  Stewart,  14  years 
transportation;  Henry  Tindal,  ji  years  transportation;  John  M.  Miller,  21  years 
transportation. 

This  is  signed  l)y  ().  A.  Weiherall,  Lieut.  Col.  commanding  officer  of  the  2nd 
Battalion  "  Tiie  Royal." 

On  the  same  day  as  the  above,  Henry  Fisher,  for  desertion,  was  sentonccd  to 
transportation  "for  the  period  of  his  natural  life."     He  was  of  the  71st  Regt. 

'J'hos.  Sutherland,  for-  desertion  of  the  same  corps,  received  the  same  sentence, 
and  (ieorge  Connolly,  also  of  the  /ist  Rcgt.,  for  the  same  crime,  '*  Desertion,'' was 
punished  "as  a  felon  (transported)  for  his  natuial  life." 

Again  on  the  jjrd  August,  five  soldiers  of  the  71st  Regt.,  committed  by  l..ieut. 
Col.  drey,  were  all  sentenced  to  transportation  for  14  years,  for  ''  Desertion." 

On  the  3rd  September,  1838,  J.  Mathewson,  for  desertion  and  selling  his  kit^ 
received  "  transportation  for  14  years  and  to  be  branded,  and  further  to  be  marked 
with  the  letter  D."  Same  day  Peter  Relly,  for  same  crime,  received  7  years  and  the 
mark  1).  Same  day,  Thos  Carty,  Thos.  l'"rancis  and  Pat.  M.  Donnely,  for  same 
crime,  received  each  14  years  and  all  marked  D.  The  last  three  belonged  to  the  151!) 
Regt.,  the  other  two  to  the  71st. 

In  May,  1839,  '''^  less  than  twenty-four  soldiers  were  committed  at  one  time 
for  desertion  by  order  of  the  Town  Major  ;  five  were  discharged,  the  remainder  were 
transported.     These  men  belonged  to  the  85th  and  34th  Regiments. 

Again,  on  the  14th  of  the  month,  eight  soldiers  were  committed  of  the  same 
Regiments,  and  all  were  transported  for  desertion.  On  the  30th  May,  two  soldiers 
of  the  73rd  Regiment  were  transponed  for  desertion,  and  on  the  4th  July  five  more 
were  transported  for  the  same  crime,  belonging  to  the  S^tlf  and  321UI  Regiments. 
Two  men  were  committed  by  Lieutenant  Maclachan,  R.A.,  for  desertion,  and  trans- 
ported on  the  31st  July. 

These  records  are  sufficient  to  show  that  many  British  soldiers  deserted  or  tried 
to  desert  during  the  Rebellion  of  1837-38. 

After  the  country  had  quieted  down  from  the  American  War,  and  peace  and  pros- 
perity once  more  reigned  over  Canada,  in  Montreal  a  movement  was  made  towards 
getting  more  light  for  the  city.  In  iSii.  the  manner  of  lighting  the  city  had  been 
suggested,  but  no  definite  conclusion  had  been  arrived  at  up  to  the  year  18 15.  The 
following  curious  inducement  for  the  successful  carrying  out  of  the  street  lighting  at 
the  time  was  "  that  ladies  might  be  induced  to  visit  their  friends  much  more  fre- 
(|uently." 

In  November.  1815,  entirely  through  the  exertions  of  Mr.  Samuel  Dawson,  part  ol 
St.  Paul  street  was  lighted  by  twenty-two  lamps,  costing  $7.00  each.  They  were  distant 
from  each  other  fifty-four  feet.  This  was  the  west  end  of  St.  Paul  street,  and  by  Christ- 
mas, same  year,  the  east  end  of  St.  Paul  street  was  similarly  lighted.  Notre  Dame  street 
followed,  and  thus  began  the  lighting  of  Montreal — now  in  this  year  1892  lighted  by 


HISTORY    OF    MONTREAL.  6_^ 

Electricity.  An  Act  passed  in  iSicS  provided  tor  liit-  orerlion  of  street  lamps  and 
night  watches  also,  consisting  of  twenty-four  in  number — their  duties  being  to  trim 
and  attend  to  the  lamiis,  and  also  art  as  police  guardians  of  the  city. 

Let  me  record  what  the  well-known  writer,   M.  de   Gaspe,   says    of  travelling 
between  Montreal  and  ()uei)ec  at  this  period,  1818  : 

"  This  reminds  me  of  a  t'lrst  voyage  from  Quebec  to  Montreal  by  steamer.  It 
was  in  October  of  1818,  at  eleven  o'clock  in  die  evening,  when  the  Caledonia,  in 
which  I  had  taken  passage,  left  the  Queen's  wharf.  Between  seven  and  eight  o'clock  on 
the  following  morning  my  companion,  the  late  Robert  Christie,  opened  the  windows 
of  his  stateroom  and  called  out  '  we  are  going  fflmously.'  We  were  really  progressing 
well,  for  we  were  opposite  Pointe-aux-'l'rembles  ;  aided  by  a  strong  wind  we  had  made 
seven  leagues  in  nine  Jiours.  We  arrived  at  the  foot  of  the  c  urreni  below  Montreal 
on  the  third  day,  congratulating  ourselves  on  the  rapidity  of  steamer  trips,  nor  did 
we  feel  humiliated  in  the  absence  of  favorable  winds,  which  did  not  last  more  than 
twenty-four  hours,  to  have  recourse  to  the  imited  strength  of  forty-two  oxen  to  assist 
us  in  ascending  the  current.  I  acknowledge  that  the  Caledonia  deserved  to  be 
ranked  as  a  first-class  steamer  of  that  lime,  and  it  was  with  regret  that  we  bade  adieu 
to  it,  after  the  pleasant  time  we  had  on  board." 

On  17th  July.  1827,  the  Laciiine  Canal  was  begun,  the  first  sod  being  removed 
by  Hon.  j.  Ricliardson.  This  year  what  had  hitherto  been  Citadel  Hill  and  a  po.vder 
magazine  was  turned  into  a  sipiare,  and  as  the  t rovernor  had  donated  it  to  the  citizens, 
it  has  received  the  name  of  Ualhousie  Square  ever  since.  A  great  fire  occurred  in 
1825.  ^^"^"^  f*^''  ^'^'-'  cTforts  of  the  men  of  the  70th  Regiment  the  conflagration  would 
have  been  much  greater.  This  year  must  be  remarkable  for  the  exertions  the  mer- 
chants of  Montreal  made  towards  the  navigation  between  Ouebec  and  Montreal. 
Very  modest  was  the  petition  to  Parliament.  '•  that  steps  should  be  taken  to  deepen 
the  channel  of  the  river,  particularly  at  Lake  St.  Peter,  and  thereby,  render  it  navigable 
throughout  the  season  for  vessels  of  two  hundred  and  fifty  tons  fully  laden.''  \V'hat 
n  contrast  to  the  magnificent  vessels  '' The  Parisian  '  or  "  The  Vancouver  "  of  the 
present  day,  and  all  this  has  been  accouiplished  within  the  past  forty  years  ! 

The  year  1832  will  ever  be  remembered  for  the  first  appearance  of  the  Asiatic 
('holera,  by  which  four  thousand  four  hundred  and  twenty  citizens  were  attacked,  and 
one  thousand  nine  hundred  and  four  died.  The  Bill  incorporating  Montreal  took 
effect  in  1833,  ^'^^^  Jacques  Viger  was  ajipointed  Mayor.  He  continued  in  oflic&lt;'  till

by  Wolfred  Nelson  in  1854-55.  Henry  Starnes  was  next  Mayor  in  1856  and  1857, 
and  he  was  succeeded  by  C.  S.  Rodier,  who  had  four  terms  of  office,  in  1858-59- 
60-61.  J.  L.  Beaudry  succeeded,  and  was  .\Layor  in  1862-63-64-65,  when  Henry

In  thi;  suimui  r  ot  i.S^;.  public  meetings  were  held  n\  almost  every  county  in 
ihe  Piovince,  especially  in  the  Di^ilrict  of  Montreal.  At  these  meetings  the  i&gt;eoplc 
were  liarangued,  by  the  leading  members  of  the  Assembly,  in  the  most  inflammatory 
language,  and  resolutions  were  ])assed  repudiating  the  authority  of  Parliament,  deny- 
ing the  obligations  of  the  laws,  and  enforcing  a  scheme  of  general  organization. 
AI)out  this  time  the  tri-colored  flag  was  disjjlayed  for  several  days  at  St.  Hyacinthe, 
and  in  the  iicigldiorhood  t)f  .St.  (.,'harles  and  St.  Denis.  Associations  were  formed, 
with  a  design  of  uverthrownig  the  (lovernrnent:  and  the  "(.'entral  Committee  of

tober  an  '  Address  to  the  Young  Men  o^  the  North  American  Colonies,"  avowing 
sentiments  of  the  most  dangerous  tendency.  I'A'ery  method  was  employed  to  circu- 
late these  sentimeiiis,  dnUing  look  place  on  Sundays  and  other  holidays  ;  armed 
bands  paraded  the  streets  of  t'le  city  in  the  night  time,  the  tn-coloied  flag  was 
hoisted,  and  the  peaceable  inhabitants  fell  themselves  insecure  if  tliey  ventured  out 
unarmed  after  the  day  had  closed. 

A  grand  meeting  of  the  ''Confederation  of  the  Six  Counties  "  look  place  at  St. 
C  ii.iries.  on  the  J3rd  of  ()ci()ber.  when  n,  fuller  and  unreserved  avowal  of  treason,d)le

it  to  be  faithful  to  the  revolutionary  princi|)ies  of  whi«  !i  it  was  emblematical.  All 
allegiance,  and  every  pretence  to  it.  were  at  once  discarded,  and  a  determination 
evinced  to  take  the  management  of  alTaiis  into  their  own  hand.'^.  This  meeting  was 
attended  by  the  Speaker  (L.  J.  P,ii)ineau)  and  twelve  Members  of  the  House  of 
.Asseaibly.  and  no  time  was  lost  in  carrying  the  treasoiKible  part  of  the  resolution 
intoi'tfect.  justices  of  the  Peace  and  Officers  of  Militia  were  comjielled  to  resign 
their  commissions,  and  many  took   ri'fuge  in  Montreal. 

On  the  same  day  a  meeting  of  the  loyal  and  constiliilion.il  inhabit. ints  uf  Mun-

Nova  Scotia  and  from  Upper  Canada.  'I'he  Atloinev  General  ariived  f:om  Quel)et

lo  p;iradc  the  stiveis  ol  the  city,  iinmedialely  issued  a  i&gt;ioclam;itioii  to  prohibii  sucli 
a  measure.     On  Monday,  the  6th,  persons  were  anxiously  inquiiing  as  to  the  motions 
and  intentions  of  the  iwi)  )iarlics  :  and   about  two  o'clock   it  was   l^nown  that  a  ron- 
siderabie  number  of  ilie  '*  Sons  of  Liberty  '    had  assembled  in  an  enclosed  yard  iiear 
St.   janies  street,   although  some    of  their  leaders  had    pledged  themselves  to   the 
Magistrates  that  no  procession  should  take  place.   ,\bout  three  hundred  of  them  sallied 
forth,  armed  with   bludgeons,  pistols,   and   other  weapons,   and  made  a  furious  and 
indiscrimmale  all.uk  on  all  that  fll  in  their  wav.      For  a  lime  ihey   had  full  [)osses- 
sion  of  the  street,  breakuig  windows,  and  tin  eat'Miing  other  mischief.       Ilui  the  Con- 
stiluiionalisls  were  soon  aroused  and  dispersed  the  riotous  assemblage,  but  weie  far 
from  satisfied  with  this  success.       .About  six  o'clock  the  Riot  Act  was  read,   and  the 
military  wi-re  called  out.      .\  |)ariy  of  the  ('onstitutionalists  were  encountered  by  the 
koyal  Regiment  in  tiont  of  I'apineau's  house  :  but  instead  of  offciing  ,iny  resistan&lt;;e 
ti.ey  heartily  cheered  the  gallant  regiment,  and  accompanied    it    to  the    Champ  dc 
Man,  where  it  was  ordered  to   take   post.     A  company  of  the    Royals  was  posted 
Jiear  the  Bisho[)  s  Church,   St.    Denis    street,     -\fter  this  all  became   quiet,  and   the 
Magistrates  ordered  the  troo|)s  to  their  barracks.     In  proceeding  thither,  the  Royals 
found  a  pai ty  atlempling  Sfune  injurv   to  r.ipmeau's   lu)use.    but  they  desisted   the 
moment  the  troops  came  upon  them.      In  the  course  of  the  evening  the  office  of  the 
Viinludtoi  was  destroyed.     The  military  patiolled  the  streets  till  daylight. 

On  the  i6tii  of  Novcinber.  warrants  were  issued,  ami  rewards  offered,  for  the  appre- 
hension of  twenty-six  indi\  iduals  charged  with  high  treason,  of  whom  all  were  of  I'rench 
origin,  excejit  oin  ;  light  were  Members  ot  the  Provincial  l\uliament,  and  the  greater 
part  ot  the  wiiole  number  were  in  the  higher  classes  of  societ) .  Eight  .ji  them  were 
t  .mimiltcd  to  jirison  at  the  time  .  lait  all  the  others  who  resided  in  town  maile  their 
escape.  Two  of  them  resided  at  St.  Johns,  and  one  at  St.  Athanase,  and  the  w.ir- 
rants  for  their  apjuehension  wee  entrusted  t&lt;.&gt;  a  peace  ofiicer,  who.  accompanied  by 
.t  body  of  tlie  Mi)nfroal  Royal  Cavalry,  proceeded  to  execute  them,  by  way  of  liOn- 
gueuil  and  &lt;  hatiibl} .  Demaray  and  IXivignon  were  ariested  at  St.  Johns,  and  the 
j&gt;arly  were  returning  to  Montreal  s^ith  them  by  the  same  route.  When  within  .d)out 
•Wo  miles  of  I/ongueuil,  the  (..av.Jr)  and  peace  officer  in  the  charge  of  the  prisoners 
were  intercepted  by  a.  large  body  of  armed  peasantry,  who  lired  upon  them  from 
tlieir  houses,  from  behind  fences,  and  from  ,i  i)arn  whic'i  bordered  the  road, 
and  tompelled  them  to  .diandon  ihoir  prisoners.  Se\eral  ul"  the  (iavalry  were 
wounded,  .ind  tluir  horses  injured,  by  the  fire  of  the  insurgents. 

( )n  the  joth  ol  November,  intelligence  was  received  that  l".  S.  llrown  had  col- 
lec  ted  a  large  fon:e  at  the  village  of  St.  Charles  on  'lu.  River  Ri&lt;  helieu,  which  he 
was  ))roccediiig  to  fortify,  and  that  I'apineau,  O'CaLaghan,  and  Wolfred  Nelson  were 
I'oni  erned  in  these  measures.  &gt;Varrants  had  been  issued  for  their  apprehension  j

narclied  towards  St,  Denis,  intending  to  attack  the  force  at  that  place,  and  then 
move  on  rapidly  to  assist  Colonel  Wetherall  of  the  Royal  Regiment  in  his  attack 
ujjon  St.  Charles.  The  march  was  a  terrible  one,  in  consequence  of  a  heavy  rain, 
and  the  rnuddiness  of  the  roads.  Tiiey  did  not  reach  St.  Denis  till  after  dayliglit. 
An  attack  was  commenced  ;  several  were  killed,  but  tinding  it  impossible  to  dislodge 
some  of  the  rebels  from  a  large  stone  house  from  which  they  were  firing,  and  his  men 
being  exhausted  by  the  fatigues  of  the  preceding  night  and  day,  the  Colonel  retreated 
upon  Sorel,  where,  after  much  suffering,  the  parly  arrived  on  the  morning  of  the  24th. 

Colonel  VVetlicrall  had  received  orders  to  attack  St.  Charles  at  the  same  lime 
the  other  fcrces  were  to  be  engaged  al  St.  Denis.  For  this  purpose  he  left  Cham- 
bly  on  the  22nd,  but  the  roads  were  so  bad  thai  his  troops  were  notable  to  reach  the 
place  till  noon  of  the  25th.  The  houses  nlong  the  route  were  deserted;  the  bridges 
broken  down,  barricades  erected,  and  every  precaution  taken  against  an  attack. 
Halting  to  reconnoitre,  C'olonel  Wetherall  observed  that  two  guns  commanded  the 
road,  and  he  therefore  resolved  to  attack  by  tkploying  to  the  right.  The  lroo])s 
were  saluted  with  a  loud  cheer  from  the  stockade,  and  a  constant  fire  was  kej)!  up 
by  the  rebels  from  the  op])osite  bank  of  the  river.  When  he  had  approached  within 
two  hundred  and  fifty  yards  from  the  wttrks.  he  took  up  a  position  with  the  hope 
that  a  dis])la}' of  his  force  would  induce  some  change  amcuig  the  infatuated  people. 
I'hey,  however,  opened  a  heavy  fire,  which  was  relumed.  He  then  ailvanced  nearer 
to  the  works,  but,  finding  the  defender^-  obstinate,  he  stormed  and  carried  them, 
burning  every  building  within  the  stockade  except  Mr.  I  )ebart/.ch's  lu)Use.  whicii  was 
extinguisiied,  and  occu|)ied  by  the  troops.  'l"he  affair  occu])ied  about  ,in  hour.  J'he 
slaughU'r  was  great  on  the  side  of  the  rebels,  but  slight  on  that  of  the  troops.  Sev- 
eral prisoners  were  taken.  Hrown,  I'apmeau,  Drolet,  and  others  crossed  the  river  to 
St.  .M.irk,  on  tlu*  arrival  of  the  troo[ts  before  St.  Charles.  On  the  whole,  the  means 
and  ])re|iarations  of  the  rei)els  were  more  formidable  than  many  ])ersons  had 
supposed.  Having  thus  captured  St.  (Miarles  and  dispersed  the  insurgents,  who 
are  said  to  liave  amounted  at  this  place  to  fifteen  hundred  fighting  men,  the 
Colonel  determined  to  attack  a  considerable  body  of  the  rebels  collecied  for  the 
pur]iose  of  cutting  off  his  retreat  to  Chambly  ;  and  on  the  morning  ol  the  2,^rd, 
he  discovered  them  mi  a  well-chosen  position,  and  under  the  protection  of  ,tn 
abatlis.  They  tied,  however,  as  soon  as  he  had  formed  to  attack,  leaving  their 
two  guns  l&gt;ehind  them. 

( )n  ihe  2i)th  of  November,  the  ( '.overnorin-Chief  issued  a  monitory  proclama- 
tion to  the  insurgents,  inviting  them  to  return  to  their  allegiance,  and  j)romising  them 
torgelfulnevs  and  immunity  for  the  past,  and  a  continuance  of  paternal  protection 
and  favor  ;  at  the  sanu  time  offering  rewards  fiir  the  apprehension  (jf  the  lea&lt;lers. 
Martial  law  was  prcjclaiined  in  the  distiict  of  .Montreal  on  the  5th  of  December,  and 
Sir  John  Colborne  invested  with  authoiily  to  execute  it. 

In  the  course  of  the  summer  and  autumn  of  t8,vH.  rumors  were  circulated  and 
'uirmises  formed,  that  another  rising  of  liie  disaffected  was  in  progress,  t)r  al  least  in

-agitation.  A.n  unusual  run  upon  the  banks,  in  the  demand  for  cash  on  the  part  of 
the  /tabitatits,\\\\o  Iiad  notes  in  their  possession,  willi  various  murmurings  and  other 
symptoms,  gave  sign  that  all  was  not  at  rest.  The  ''sympathy,"  as  it  was  termed, 
shewn  to  the  insurgents  by  many  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  border  States  kept  alive 
the  expectation.  Early  in  October,  if  not  before,  many  facts  were  in  tlie  knowledge 
of  the  Governor-in-Chief  and  the  Commander  of  the  Forces  which  called  for  in- 
creasing vigilance,  and  justified  active  prei)aralion.  The  lenient  measures  which 
had  been  adopted  with  regard  to  several  of  those  who  had  been  apprciiended  for 
their  share  in  the  lust  rebellion,  instead  of  being  followed  by  a  grateful  return  of  alle- 
giance, were,  in  many  instances,  construed  into  fear,  and  abused  to  the  purposes  of 
renewed  aggression  and  tumult.  These  seditious  movements  were,  for  the  most 
part,  confined  to  tiie  south  side  of  the  St.  Lawrence  ;  the  country  above  Si.  Eustache 
and  its  neighborhood  remaining  perfectly  quiet,  whatever  might  have  been  the  hints 
or  threats  of  individuals. 

On  the  29th  and  30th  of  November  nearly  a  hundred  rebels  from  Napierville 
and  Beauharnois  were  l)rought  in  as  prisoners. 

The  Hon.  I).  Mondclct  and  Charles  D.  Day,  Es(|.,  having  l)een  appointed 
Judge  Advocates  in  conjunction  wiih  Ca[)tain  Muller,  the  Courl-Marlial  commenced 
the  trial  of  the  twelve  following  prisoners  on  Wednesday,  the  28lh  of  November  : — 
Joseph  Narcisse  ('ardinal.  Joseph  Duquette,  Joseph  I/Ecuyer,  Jean  Louis  Thibert, 
Jean  Marie  Thibert,  Leandre  Ducharmc.  Joseph  Guimond,  Louis  Guerin,  Edouard 
Therien,  Anloine  Cote,  Maurice  Lepailleur,  Louis  Lesiege.  After  a  patient  and 
imi^arliai  investigation,  in  which  the  prisoners  had  the  benefit  of  able  advocates, 
two  of  tiiem,  Edouard  'I'herien  and  Louis  l,esiege,  were  acquitted,  the  other  ten 
were  foinid  guilty,  and  condemned  to  deatli.  and  two  of  them,  J.  N.  Cardinal  and  J. 
Duquette,  were  executed  on  Friday,  the  21st  of  December. 

On  the  iSth  of  January,  1839,  five  were  executed  over  the  front  gateway  of  the 
(iaol:  P.  K.  Decoigne.  enga.yed  at  Napiervillr,  and  Jacfpies  Robert,  two  brothers  of 
the  name  of  Sanguinet,  and  P.  Ihimelin.  The  gallows  had  been  removed  to  a  more 
public  situation  to  convince  the  habitants  of  the  icalily  of  the  executions,  for  on  that 
point  they  appear  to  have  been  incredulous. 

On  the  15th  February,  1839,  ^l^*^'  '^^^  'i^c  I'^ifiots  were  hanged.  Perhaps  the 
most  interesting  fact  at  the  death  of  Do  Lorimier  was  the  act  of  our  late  citizen, 
William  Workman,  who.  the  day  before  the  execution,  went  to  Sir  John  Colbornc 
and  showed  him  that  those  e.\eciilions  were  illegal, — that  the  military  can  never  ride 
over  the  civil  law  except  in  revolutions  when  no  tivil  courts  are  in  existence, — but  all 
in  vain.  Mr.  Workman,  who  was  then  a  (!aptain  of  Militia,  took  off  his  sword  and 
presenting  it  to  t!ie  Commander,  said  that  henceforth  he  would  never  serve  the  (Jtieen 
as  an  officer,  and  for  the  whole  course  of  his  life  he  never  after  had  anything  to  do 
with  tlie  Militia  or  Volunteers,  as  he  considered  those  deaths  "  military  mnniers." 

On  the  0th  of  May,  1839,  Benjamin  Molt,  of  Albtirgh,  Vermont,  was  found 
guilty  of  treason  at  Lacolle   by  the  Cotirt  Martial,  and  sentenced  to  death,  but  was

reprieved.  With  this  trial  the  Court  finished  its  labors,  after  a  session  of  five  months 
and  a  half,  during  which  one  hundred  and  ten  prisoners  had  been  tried,  twelve  exe- 
cuted, nine  acquitted,  and  the  remainder  placed  under  sentence  of  death. 

MONTREAL,  DPXEMBER,  1837. 

The  following  fine  word-paintings  are  from  the  Hicile  pen  of  John  Eraser,  who 
was  one  of  the  most  active  members  of  tlie  Loyalists  of  that  day.  It  includes  a 
picture  of  1837  'i"d  one  of  1838.  They  are  taken  from  a  most  interesting  volume 
published  lust  year  by  him  and  entitled.  "  Pen  and  Ink  Sketches  of  Montreal."  Those 
who  have  not  the  book  itself  will  read  these  pages  of  his  with  great  satisfaction. 

"  There  was  a  sound  through  the  dark  and  narrow  streets  of  old  Montreal  on 
the  night  of  the  i3lh  of  December,  1837. 

It  was  the  sound  of  armed  men  mustering  and  hurrying  in  wild  confusion  and 
under  fearful  excitement,  all  concentrating  to  a  rallying  point — the  old  Champ  de 
Mars. 

In  the  early  morning  of  that  eventful  day  Sir  John  Colborne,  the  Commander- 
in-Chief,  started  from  Montreal  on  his  march,  with  about  2,000  men,  to  disperse  the 
rebel  force  encamped  at  the  village  of  St.  Eustache,  some  twenty  miles  to  the  north. 
The  whole  northern  district  was  then  in  open  rebellion.  The  city  had  been  left 
almost  entirely  under  the  protection  of  the  volunteer  force. 

Sucii  of  the  citizens  as  were  on  the  street  about  eight  o'clock  that  night  would 
have  seen  a  horseman,  one  of  the  Lachine  Troop  of  Cavalry,  so  well  known  by  their 
fierce-looking  bear-skin  helmets,  dasiiing  along  our  streets  at  a  mad  gallop.  The 
guard  at  the  city  gale  at  Dow's  brewery  was  no  hindrance  to  his  wild  speed,  the 
crossed  bayonets  of  the  four  sentries  posted  there  being  cleared  at  a  bound  :  his 
uniform  being  known  to  the  sentries  saved  him  from  a  passing  shot.  Then  along 
old  St.  Joseph  and  Notre  Dame  streets,  at  the  same  wild  pace,  to  the  Main  Guard, 
which  stood  nearly  in  front  of  the  present  Court  House,  and  there  delivered  his 
verbal  despatch  from  Major  Tenner,  commanding  officer  at  Lachine,  to  the  officer  of 
the  day  in  command  at  Montreal,  nearly  as  follows: — 'The  rebels  have  escaped 
from  St.  Eustache,  and  arc  reported  advancing  in  force  on  Lachine  to  capture  the 
arms  stored  there  fi)r  the  frontier  volunteers.'  This  despatch  was  delivered  at  the 
Main  (iuard  within  thirty  minutes  after  the  trooper  had  mounted  his  horse  at  Lachine  ; 
the  distance  being  over  eight  miles. 

Then  there  was  wild  hurrying  on  the  streets  of  Montreal.  '  To  arms  ! '  was  the 
cry  ;  'the  rebels  are  at  hand  1 '  The  alarm  bells  rang — the  news  Hew  like  lightning, 
reaching  every  nook  and  corner  of  the  city  in  a  few  minutes  ;  the  city  was  confined 
within  small  limits  at  that  time.  Ecw  of  the  young  volunteers  of  that  day  are  now 
living,  but  the  wild  excitement  of  that  night  can  never  be  forgotten  by  the  living  ones. 
All  was  uproar  and  disorder,  but  amid  this  disorder  and  uproar  there  was  method, 
pre-arranged,  to  meet  any  such  emergency. 

The  rallying  words  were  :  '  Every  man  to  his  post !  ' — the  headquarters  of  bis 


HISTORY    OI'    MONTREAL.  7 1 

company  or  regiment, — and,  within  the  space  of  two  hours,  nearly  4,000  armed  men — 
volunteers,  old  and  young  ;  professional  men,  clerks,  mechanics  and  laborers — stood 
side  by  side  in  their  ranks,  shoulder  to  shoulder,  a  solid  mass  of  living  valor  ready 
to  do  their  duty. 

It  was  a  grand  sight  to  see  the  mustering  squads  falling  in  and  taking  up  their 
double-quick  march  to  the  rallying  point,  with  bugles  blowing  and  drums  beating 
announcing  tlieir  approach,  but  it  is  regretable,  now,  to  tiiink  that  so  dire  a  neces- 
sity ever  existed  in  our  country.  The  different  regiments  took  up  their  line  of  march 
to  the  outskirts  of  the  city,  and  proceeded  as  far  as  the  top  of  the  Tanneries  Hill, 
the  high  road  to  [^aciiine,  waiting  orders  from  the  front  to  direct  their  onward  course. 

The  alarm  had  reached  Laciiine  about  seven  o'clock.  A  French-Canadian 
loyalist,  Paul  Lcbert,  living  near  St.  Genevieve,  brought  the  report  of  the  supposed 
rebel  advance  on  Lachine.  Major  Penner  immediately  sent  orders  to  the  captains 
of  the  four  Foot  companies  of  the  Lachine  Brigade  to  muster  their  men  ;  some  of 
them  had  five  miles  to  march  in.  By  ten  o'clock  every  man  was  in  front  of  Laflamme's 
hotel,  the  headquarters  of  the  brigade,  presenting  a  front  of  two  hundred  and  I'orly 
bayonets  and  nearly  sixty  swordsmen — as  fine  a  body  of  men  as  could  be  found  in 
the  Province.  Word  having  been  sent  over  to  Caughnawaga,  about  two  hundred 
Indian  warriors  crossed  the  river  and  joined  the  Brigade. 

By  the  advice  of  old  Colonel  Wilgress,  a  Peninsular  veteran,  then  living  at 
Lachine,  who  undertook  or  assumed  the  direction  of  atfairs,  the  Lachine  Troop  and 
the  Village  Company  of  Foot  (Captain  Leponsec's)  were  sent  to  the  front  or  advance, 
half-a-mile  above  the  village,  to  watch  and  to  report  the  rebel  advance.  The  tiiree 
other  companies  of  Foot  arrived  shortly  afterwards. 

The  first  to  arrive  was  Captain  Begley's  company  from  Lower  Lachine.  The 
writer  was  with  this  company.  They  came  in  at  double-quick,  nearly  a  run,  and 
drew  up  opposite  Laflamme's.  Such  a  cheer  as  greeted  their  arrival;  it  rent  the  very 
air.  Then  Captain  Carmichael,  with  his  company  from  Cote  St.  Paul,  reached  the 
villaiyi  by  way  of  the  banks  of  the  Lachine  canal,  and  lastly,  Captain  Charles"  com- 
pany, from  Cote  St  Pierre  and  the  Tanneries,  arrived  and  formed,  amid  a  deafening 
cheer.  But  let  us  turn  our  eyes  to  the  St.  I^awrence.  What  a  cheering  sight  was  to 
be  there  seen  !  The  river  was  literally  covered  with  canoes.  Kvery  warrior  in  Caugh- 
nawaga was  on  the  river  crossing  to  join  the  Lachine  Brigade. 

The  cheer  of  welcome  from  that  little  band  of  volunteers  which  greeted  the 
arrival  of  the  Indian  warriors,  and  their  wild  warwhoop  in  response,  was  a  sound,  a 
sight  and  a  scene  ;  the  like  of  it  may  never  again  be  heard  or  seen  in  this  province  ! 
By  ten  o'clock  fully  500  armed  men  of  all  classes  stood  in  the  old  village  of  Lachine. 
The  night  passed  over  without  any  enemy  putting  in  an  appearance.  There  were  no 
telegraphs  in  those  days.  All  communication  was  made  and  kept  up  by  the  Cavalry. 
The  Lachine  Troop  was  then  overworked,  carrying  despatches  and  keeping  up  the 
lines  of  communication  between  the  outposts."

( Written  on  the  Jubilee  of  the  Day.) 

SUNDAY  THE  4TH  OF  NOVEMBER,   1838. 

"  Tlie  jMcsent  generation  will  aiijMcciate  a  ])en  and  ink  sketch  of  the  opening 
day  of  tlie  second  rebellion  of  Lower  Canada  by  one  who  was  an  eye-witness  and 
shouldered  his  musket  at  that  time.  The  rebellion  of  1837  ^^^'^  closed  and  the  winter 
of  1838  passed  over  quietly  so  far  as  Lower  Canada  was  concerned,  and  the  volun- 
teers were  called  upon  to  ])ile  their  arms  and  to  lay  aside  their  warlike  apparel.  It 
was,  literally  sjieaking,  '  turning  their  swords  into  ])loughshares  and  their  spears 
into  ])runing  hooks  and  to  study  war  no  more.'  'I'he  boys  did  not  altogether  relish 
this,  for,  it  must  be  admitted,  they  were  spoiling  for  a  fight. 

Springtime  came,  summer  passed,  a  bountiful  harvest  crowned  the  year,  and  the 
blasts  of  November  have  again  made  fields  and  forests  bare.  Low,  murmuring 
sounds  of  discontent  were  then  heard,  here,  there  and  every wiiere  over  the  whole 
length  and  breadth  of  the  land,  something  like  a  smouldering  volcano,  ready  to  burst 
forth  at  any  moment  :  and  instead  of  the  usual  autumn  thanksgivings  of  a  grateful 
peojjle  foi  a  bountiful  liarvest,  the  standard  of  rebellion  was  again  raised  in  Novem- 
ber, 1838.  Roofless  walls  and  ruined  homes  marked  its  desolating  trr':ks,  leaving  a 
dark  blot  on  the  jiages  of  our  country's  history. 

On  Sunday  morning,  the  4th  of  November,  1838,  the  standard  of  rebellion  was 
again  raised  in  Lower  Canada.  Tl. ;  whole  south  side  of  the  St.  Lawrence  was  once 
more  in  open  rebellion.  The  princijial  camps  were  at  ]5eauharnois  and  Chaleauguay. 
'J"he  first  actual  outbreak  of  this  second  rebellion  occurred  at  Beauharnois  on 
Saturday  afternoon,  the  3rd.  The  ]:)atriots,  as  they  styled  themselves,  seized  the  mail 
steamer  '  Henry  Brougham,'  while  on  her  way  down  from  the  Cascades  to  Lachine. 
The  ])assengers  were  detained  as  ])risoners,  among  whom  were  Sheriff  Mclntyre,  of 
Cornwall,  and  Duncan  McDonald,  now  of  Montreal. 

In  the  early  morning  of  Sunday,  the  4th,  the  patriots  of  Chateauguay  marched 
in  force  on  Caughnawaga  to  disarm  the  Indians.  The  Indians  were  then  attending 
early  mass  in  a  small  Chapel  half  a  mile  beliind  their  village.  The  Chapel  waS  sur- 
rounded by  the  patriots.  They  said  they  came  as  friends  to  have  a  ])arley.  The  Indians 
exi)ressed  surprise  that  friends  should  come  armed,  and  asked  Ihem  to  i)ile  their 
arms  preparatory  to  a  friendly  talk.  The  innocent  patriots  |)iled  their  arms — they 
were  immediately  taken  possession  of  by  the  Indians.  Sixty-four  of  the  patriots  were 
made  i)risoners  ;  eleven  more  were  secured  during  the  day  ;  making  in  all  seventy- 
five  prisoners.  The  rest  of  them  escajjcd  through  the  woods  to  their  camp  at  Cha- 
teauguay. 

The  arrival  of  the  prisoners  at  Lachine  was  the  first  intimation  there  of  the 
outbreak  of  the  second  rebellion.  The  Indians  of  Caughnawaga  crossed  the  river 
with  the  first  lot  of  sixty-four  prisoners  and  landed  them  near  the  Windmill,  close  by 
the  old  Parish  French  Church,  just  at  the  foot  of  the  cross  road  leading  through 
Cote  St.  Paul.     This  was  about  ten  o'clock.     The  people  of  Lower  Lachine  were 


KISTORV    OF    MONTRKAL.  73 

then  on  their  way  to  attend  morning  service  at  their  different  churches.  Fancy  their 
surprise  !  Here  was  new  work  for  them.  It  did  not  take  long  to  muster  Captain 
Pegley's  Coujpany  of  Foot  and  twenty  of  the  Cavalry,  who  took  the  prisoners  m 
charge. 

The  line  of  marcli  was  soon  formed.  Instead  of  taking  the  high  road  to  Mon- 
treal by  the  way  of  Cote  St.  Pierre — the  Upper  Lachine  road — the  march  was  taken 
by  the  cross  road  through  Cote  St.  Paul.  It  was  a  liard  tramp  of  three  hours ;  it  had 
been  raining  most  of  the  previous  week  ;  the  mud  was  ankle  deep.  The  men  would 
not  hear  of  any  conveyances  being  provided  ;  the  prisoners  must  walk  it — they  .said  ; 
the  men  also  walked.  The  march  of  this  escort  and  their  prisoners  through  Cote. 
St.  Paul  and  ilie  Tanneries  caused  great  excitement. 

By  the  time  it  reached  the  Tanneries  fully  one  hundred  stragglers  had  joined, 
but  not  exactly  comprehending  what  it  really  was,  as  perfect  silence  was  maintained 
in  the  ranks. 

News  of  the  incoming  prisoners,  with  their  escort,  had  early  reached  town. 
Their  numbers  were  swelled  by  hundreds  of  stragglers  on  their  onward  course. 
There  were  no  telegraphs  in  those  early  days  to  transmit  the  news,  and  the  report  had 
reached  Montreal  that  the  I.achine  Brigade  was  marching  in,  in  full  force,  having  the 
whole  rebel  camp  of  Chaleauguay  as  prisoners  ;  such  was  the  -ictual  report  that 
reached  the  city  that  Sunday  morning,  the  4th  November,  1838. 

The  readc-r  of  this  day  may  [)iclure  to  himself  the  excitement,  hurry  and  bustle 
on  the  streets  of  old  Montreal  caused  by  this  report. 

Far  out  in  the  outskirts  of  the  city,  towards  the  Tanneries,  the  escort  was  met 
by  thousands  of  the  citizens.  The  sight  that  met  their  astonished  gaze  was  strange 
and  new  to  them.  Heie  was  a  large  Lody  of  men  advancing,  having  been  largely 
supplemented  by  stragglers.  Ten  of  the  Lachine  'I'roop  rode  in  front  and  ten  in  the 
rear,  and  on  both  sides  were  thirty  men  of  the  Lower  Lachine  ("ouipany  of  Foot, 
having  the  sixty-four  prisoners  in  the  centre.  The  stragglers  who  had  joined  were 
totally  ignorant  of  the  whole  affair,  except  the  fact  of  seeing  the  prisoners  and  their 
escort.  The  writer  was  one  of  the  escort.  There  have  been,  time  and  again,  many 
programmed  processions  in  our  streets,  but  never  before  nor  since  that  day  has  so 
remarkable  a  procession  passed  along  the  streets  of  old  Montreal.  In  front  and  in 
rear,  as  steady  as  regulars,  rode  the  yoimg  boys  of  the  Lachine  Troop  with  their  bear- 
skin helmets  and  drawn  swords,  and  the  Fool  ('ompany  on  both  sides  with  fixed 
bayonets,  guarding  and  protecting  the  prisoners  from  the  surrounding  excited  and 
enraged  citizens.     They  moved  along  steadily  and  in  perfect  silence. 

Come,  young  Canadian  reader,  and  take  your  stand  with  us  on  the  front  steps 
of  the  old  French  Cathedral  ;  let  us  suppose  the  time  to  be  about  three  o'clock  in 
the  afternoon  of  Sunday,  the  4th  of  November,  1838;  and,  in  retrospect,  let  us 
cast  our  eyes  up  Notre  Dame  street ;  an  immense  crowd,  reaching  back  to  McGill 
street,  having  no  flags  waving  nor  drums  beating  to  announce  their  appproach,  is 
slowly,  solemnly  advancing  in  funeral-like  procession  !     What  is  it,  and  who  are 


74  HISTORY    OF  MONTREAL. 

they  ?  It  is  the  escort  from  Lachine  with  their  sixty-four  prisoners  wending  their 
way  down  to  the  then  '  new  gaol,'  with  thousands  of  the  citizens  lining  the  streets 
and  following  in  the  rear. 

It  was  a  sad  day  and  truly  '  a  funeral-like  procession'  for  tiie  poor  prisoners, 
all  young  men,  in  the  prime  of  life  and  manhood.  They  had  marched  onl  from  their 
camp  at  Chateauguay  in  the  early  dawn  of  the  Sunday  morning,  in  high  hopes  and 
full  of  life  and  vigor.  They  were  now  in  the  afternoon  on  their  way  to  be  enclosed 
within  pri.  n  u\.lls  !  The  writer  remembers  well  the  nnploring  and  anxious  looks  of 
those  poor  young  boys  ;  and  although  fifty  years  have  i)assed  away  he  can  hardly 
now  restrain  the  '  welling  tears  '  as  that  picture  rises  vividly  before  him.  A  few  of 
them  were  afterwards  liberated  ;  others  of  them  suffered  the  extreme  penalty  of  the  law 
for  the  crime  of  high  treason  ! 

It  were  well  if  we  could  dra\.'  a  dark  veil  over  those  dark  days  and  darker  scenes 
and  blot  them  out  of  memory.      vVe  cannot. 

On  our  arrival  at  the  new  gaol,  and  during  our  short  stay  there,  cabs  and 
caleches  were  arriving  filled  with  prisoners  to  be  locked  up,  having  some  notable 
characters  among  them.  The  sun  had  gone  down,  and  that  never-to-be-forgotten 
Sunday  night  closed  in  darkness  over  the  unlighted  streets  of  old  Montreal.  The 
Lachine  escort,  after  handing  over  their  prisoners  to  the  gaol  guard,  reformed  for  their 
rendezvous  at  Grant's  Hotel,  on  St.  Henry  street,  the  Montreal  headquarters  of  the 
Lachine  Brigade,  to  partake  of  refreshments  preparatory  to  their  return  march  home. 

The  escort,  after  leaving  the  gaol,  had  over  ten  miles  to  reach  home  ;  rain 
was  then  pouring  down  in  torrents. 

That  return  march  is  as  fresh  in  the  memory  of  the  writer  as  if  it  were  yesterday. 

The  tramp  up  old  St.  Mary  and  Notre  Dame  streets  was  a  tiresome  one  of  two 
miles  over  muddy  roads  to  Grant's  Hotel.  The  streets  were  crowded  with  armed 
men  ;  all  was  excitement.  Guards  and  pickets  were  being  posted  at  every  exposed 
part  of  the  city,  and  cannon  placed  at  every  avenue  or  road  leading  into  the  country 
and  facing  the  river. 

After  leaving  Grant's  Hotel,  our  return  march  was  up  old  St.  Maurice  street  ; 
wij  had  in  charge  a  large  quantity  of  ammunition  and  other  supplies  which  we  found 
waiting  us  at  Grant's  to  be  conveyed  to  Lachine.  The  city  gate  at  Dow's  brewery 
closed  behind  us  with  a  death-like  sound,  allowing  us  to  grope  our  way  as  best  we 
could  through  the  thick  darkness  ahead. 

There  were  no  macadamized  roads  in  those  early  days  ;  it  was  mud  underfoot 
— mud  to  the  right — mud  to  the  left  of  us,  mud  everywhere,  and  thick  darkness  all 
around  !     Worse  still,  a  concealed  enemy  niight  be  met  with  at  any  moment. 

At  nearly  every  mile  a  cavalryman  dashed  past,  hailing  us,  with  despatches  to 
or  from  Montreal  ;  it  was  an  exciting  march.  Tired,  wet  and  hungry,  the  escort 
reached  its  headquarters,  Laflamme's  Hotel,  Lachine,  by  lo  o'clock  that  night. 

The  writer  is  one  of  the  very  few  now  living  of  the  three  hundred  of  the  Lachine 
Brigade  who  did  duty  at  Lachine  during  the  week  ending  the  eleventh  of  November, 
1838. 


HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL.  75 

The  Brigade  and  the  Caughnawaga  Indians  marched  on  Chateauguay  on 
Saturday  niglit,  the  loth.  A  small  portion  of  the  Brigade,  the  writer  among  them, 
was  at  the  burning  (jf  Beauliarnois  on  Sunday  morning,  the  nth  of  November.  1S3S. 

Fifty  years  have  passed  away,  and  from  the  seed  sown  broadcast  over  the  land 
during  tliat  rebellion,  there  arose  high  and  above  the  ruins  of  the  patriots'  visionary 
republic,  the  grand  structure  or  foundation  of  Canada's  present  responsible  govern- 
ment, entombing  or  casting  to  the  winds  all  family  compacts  or  other  obstructions, 
and  securing  to  Canadians  their  rights  as  free-born  British  subjects  ;  and,  in  truth, 
it  must  be  said,  that  Canadian  liberty  had  not  its  birthright  under  the  sunshine  or 
the  smile  of  heaven,  but  was  nursed  and  cradled  amid  the  rage  and  the  strife  of 
fratricidal  foes. 

The  time  will  come  when  the  memories  of  Canada's  rebel  dead  of  1837  '•■'"^  '^38 
Vf'ill  be  revered  and  held  sacred  in  every  British  colony,  distant  or  near,  as  the 
fathers  of  colonial  responsible  government,  under  wl'ich  every  British  colony  is 
now  governed. 

And  on  the  pages  of  Canadian  History — yet  to  be  written — the  rebel  dead  of 
Canada  of  1837  '^'^^  ^838  will  be  classed  in  comparison  and  held  uj)  side  by  side 
with  the  great  Barons  of  England  who,  on  Runnymede,  demanded  and  obtained 
from  King  John  the  great  charter  of  English  liberty." 

Let  me  now  give  this  generation  a  few  of  the  commitments,  etc.,  of  this  interest- 
ing period. 

The  first  on  the  list  is  that  of  the  late  Sheriff  Leblanc,  .and  the  document  tlius 
reads  :

sides  being  y.C.  at  ilie  time  of  his  death,  he  had  been  decorated  by  His  Holiness 
'J'he  Pojie..  and  his  children  may  rest  assured  that  all  he  did  in  1S37  was  done  from  a

the  future  good  of  his  native  land.

Wan  appointed  Mayor. 

l!i  icS44,  ''"'  &lt;&lt;overnnient  was  iranslatetl  from  Kingston  to  Montreal. 

The  following  graphi&lt;:  account  of  the  ship  fever  of  1846,  frum  tin;  pen  of  an  ex- 
Chief  of  Tolice,  is  truthful  and  correct  :  - 

'•  In  the  summer  of  1846,  Montreal  was  visited  by  the  dread  jjestilence  tiiat  cainc 
to  be  known  as  the  'Ship  Kever.' 

As  (.'hief  of  I'olice  I  was  tlirown  into  the  midst  of  tin;  saddest  scenes  possible 
for  man  to  wilncNS.  Tragic  were  the  sigiits  that  tiuis  came  under  my  daily  view. 
Officials  of  all  grades  and  classes,  Govermncnl,  Municipal  and  (!lerical,  carried  their 
lives  in  their  hand:;,  uulieir  ministrations  u&gt;  those  sad  (uacasls  from  their  nativiland. 
Amongst  the  sacriHced  were  the  Mayor  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Uishop  of  Montreal, 
many  clergymen  of  all  denominations,  and  very  many  Sisters  of  ('narity  aiul  others. 
How  often  I  have  witnessed  the  blessed  ministrations  of  those  adnn'rable  women  at 
the  bedsides  of  the  sick  ami  dying  at  what  was  then  a  \eritable  pest  house,  the 
Emigrant  Hospital  at  Point  St.  Charles.  Their  errand  of  mercy  was  in  so  many 
cases  an  errand  of  death  to  themselves,  that  one  could  not  help  pitying  and  admir- 
ing the  iieroK   and  self  sac  rificing  devotion  of  these 

'  Noble  ty|)C's  of  jjood  licroii-  woinniiiiond,' 

My    Cod's  good    ])rovidence  I    escaped   unscathed,    whilst   so   many   of  my   co- 
laborers  f(  II  around  me.     'I'he  small  police  force  then   under  my  commaiul,  number- 
ing forty-five  men  all  told,  suifered  pro  rata  of  its  sticngth  pretty  severely,    four  men 
died  of  the  ship   fever,    fourteen   olh.ers  contracted    the  disease,  but  ultimately  re- 
covered,     from  alioul  midsummer  until  far  into  September  the   |)estilence  raged  in 
our    midst,   and    day   aftttr  day   crowds  of  infected    emigrants    were  cast   ui»on   our 
wharves.      i'hese  Wiie  generally  landed  whert'  the  .\llan    steamships  now  berth,    the 
nearest  spot  lo  the  Ismigranl  Sheds  at  the  IN^iiil.      i'olicemen  wi-re  stationed  at   all 
the  bridges  over  the  ("anal,  to  st(jp  them  getting  back  from  the  sheds,  for  which  ihey 
had  a  great  horror  and  detestation.      In  consequence  of  this  they  were-  ever  endeav- 
oring to  make  their  escape  therefrom.      Many  did  so  escape,  and  were  afterwards 
l)icked  up  sick,  dying  or  dead,  hid  away  in  stables,  out-houses,  or  alley  ways  in  the 
city,  to  which,  despairing,   they  had  betaken  themselves.      To  meet  this  emergeni  y, 
I  had  oigani/ed  a  sort  of  and)ulaiice,  a  spring  wagon,  covered  by  a  white  lilt,   whi&lt;;h 
was  kepi  ctuislantly  on  duty   at  the  (Jenlral   Station,  ready   for  the  first  summons. 
From  the  day  of  its  establishment,    19th  July,  to   the  day   that  it  was  discontinued, 
Hjlh  Se|)tcinber  following,  this  ambidance  had  conveyed  to  the  hospital  no  less  than 
472  sick  .md  (&gt;o  dead,  found  hid  away  in  various  holes  and  corners  of  the  city. 


86  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL. 

It  may  be  readily  imagined  that  it  was  no  easy  task  to  find  people  to  undertake 
so  dangerous  and  forbidding  a  work.  The  cartel  who  drove  the  ambulance  would  do 
nothing  else.  To  handle  the  dead,  or  dying,  it  was  no  easy  matter  to  find  men  will- 
ing to  run  the  risk.  As  it  was  not  j)OHsil)le  to  get  men  for  this  pnrjjose,  volunteers 
had  to  be  sought  for,  at  high  wages,  amongst  the  loafers  who  hung  about  the  wharves. 
Strange  to  say,  none  of  these  men  ever  suffered  from  their  contact  with  the  infected. 
One  of  the  common  daily  sights  in  Welnngton  street,  in  those  sad  days,  were  the 
coffins  on  their  way  to  the  Emigrant  Hospital.  These  |)laiii  deal  coffins  might  b^ 
seen  any  day  piled  uj)  in  the  Hospital  yard,  awaiting  the  daily  toll  f)f  the  dead,  who 
were  always  buried  at  night. 

The  duties  of  the  police  in  such  times,  as  may  well  be  imagined,  were  onerous, 
and  tryuig  in  the  extreme,  1  cannot  say  that  they  were  borne  cheerfully,  but  I  must 
freely  admit  that  they  were  submitted  to  without  a  murmur.  As  I  have  before  noted, 
the  casualties  for  so  small  a  body  were  severe.  A  third  of  the  Force  were  prostrated 
by  sickness,  whilst  death  exacted  its  tenth.  Death  stalked  abroad  in  the  streets  at 
noonday,  and  when  he  struck  his  victims  it  was  suddenly  and  swiftly. 

At  Point  St.  Charles,  near  the  northern  end  of  tlie  Victoria  IJridgc,  in  a  small 
plot  of  land,  lie  deposited  the  remains  of  6,000  of  the  victims  of  that  calamitous  year. 
A  large  boulder  stone,  j)laced  on  a  solid  base  of  ashlar  masonry,  murks  their  burial 
place.  This  monument,  erected  by  the  generous  contributions  of  the  workmen  on 
the  Victoria  Bridge,  in  1859,  commemorates  the  sad  event,  and  preserves  from 
desecration  the  spot  hallowed  by  such  tragic  memories." 

Wc  cannot  close  the  account  of  this  dreadful  event  without  inserting  the  poem 
of  our  own  well-known  writer,  Mrs.  Leprohon,  on

A  kindly  thought — a  generous  deed  ! 

Ye  gallant  sons  of  toil  ! 
No  nobler  trophy  could  ye  raise. 

On  your  adopted  soil. 
Than  this  funeral  stone  to  the  good  and  brave, 
Who  came  to  our  shores  but  to  find  a  grave. 

Like  you  they  left  their  fatherland 

And  crossed  the  ocean  foam, 
To  seek  for  themselves  a  new  career. 

And  make  another  home. 
But  alas  for  hearts  that  had  beat  so  high  ! 
They  reached  the  goal,  but  only  to  die.

Let  no  rich  worldling  dare  to  say, 

For  tlicm  why  should  we  grieve  ? 
JBut  jjaupcrs  came  tliey  to  our  shores, 

Rags,  poverty,  to  leave. 
Kacli  stalwart  frame  full  of  power  and  health, 
And  eacli  active  arm  was  a  mine  of  wealth. 

'Twas  a  mournful  end  to  day-dreams  high, 

A  sad  and  fearful  doom, 
To  excliange  tiioir  fever-stricken  ships 

For  the  loathsome  typhus  tomb, 
.\nd  ere  they  had  glanced  at  our  clear  bright  sky, 
In  a  stranger  land  breathe  their  dying  sigh. 

The  strong  man  in  the  ])rime  of  life, 

Struck  down  in  one  short  liour  ; 
Tlie  loving  wife;  the  rose-checked  girl, 

Fairer  tiian  opening  flower  ; 
The  ardent  youth  witii  fond  hopes  elate — 
O'ertaken  all  by  one  coamion  fate. 

Long  since  forgotten,  here  they  rest, 

Sons  of  a  distant  land  ; 
The  epoch  of  their  short  career, 

Mere  foot-prints  on  life's  sand  : 
But  this  stone  will  tell  through  many  a  year, 
They  died  on  our  shores  and  they  slumber  hcie. 

In  January.  1847,  Lord  Fllgin  arrived  in  Montreal  as  the  newly  appointed  Gov- 
ernor-General of  Canada. 

In  January  of  nevt  year,  1848,  a  great  inundation  took  place,  and   nuich  resem- 
bled the  great  flood  of  a  few  years  ago. 

On  the  i8th  of  June,  the   largest  bell   in   Canada  was  christened,  an    immense 
congregation  of  citizens  being  present  at  Notre  Dame  for  the  ceremony. 

Among  the  public  buildings  erected  this  year  were  the  Reid  Wing  to  the  General 
Hospital,  St.  Andrew's  Church,  and  the  Protestant  Orphan  Asylum. 

The  following  is  taken  from  my  "  History  of  the  Montreal  Prison  from  1784   to 
1887": 

During  the  Session  of  Parliament  in  1849,  ^  ^'^^  ^^'^•''  introduced  and  passed 
providing  for  the  payment  of  losses  sustained  during  the  Rebellion.  The  British 
inhabitants  were  indignant  that  any  such  bill  should  have  been  introduced,  and  every 
means  were  taken  to  ])revent  its  passage  through  the  House.  When  it  had  been 
passed,  great  anxiety  was  manifested  as  to  whether  it  would  receive  the  sanction  of 
the  Governor  (General.     On  Wednesday,  the  25th  April,  1849, — '^^  ^'^V  which  will  be

long  noted  in  the  ;innuls  oT  our  city,-- Lord  Kigin  ])roceeded  to  llie  rarlianient  House 
to  sanction  tl^c  new  tariff,  and  other  Acts.  About  five  o'c:h)(:k  in  the  afternoon  he 
sanctioned  a  number  of  bills,  and  among  tliem  was  the  objectionable  Rei)eIiion  Bill- 
No  sooner  had  tiie  bill  become  law  than  the  information  was  conveyed  to  the  crowds 
in  wailing  outside  of  the  building,  and  when  His  Kxcellency  appeared  he  was  re- 
ceived with  groans  and  pelted  with  stones  and  eggs.  The  excitement  was  intense. 
Printed  notices  were  ])osted  in  various  parts  of  the  city,  calling  a  mass  meeting  to 
beheld  inuiiedialely  on  the  Champ  de  Mars,  and  by  eight  o'clock  an  innnensc  num- 
ber of  persons  had  assembled,  when,  after  some  strong  resolutions  had  been  passed, 
the  cry  was  raisetl  ''To  the  Parliament  Buildinixs.'' 
^P  'The  liouse  of  Assembly  was  engaged  in  discussing  the  Judic.iture  ]'&gt;ill,  when  a 

loud  shout  gave  the  members  warning  that  a  riot  was  fomenting  outside.  A  number 
of  stones  were  now  thrown  through  the  windows,  and  in  a  short  time  there  were  but 
few  squares  of  glass  left  unbroken  in  tiie  whole  range  of  the  buildings. 

Hy  this  time  the  members  had  all  retreated,  when  about  a  (If)zen  jiersons  entered 
the  .Assembly  Hall,  and  one  of  them  ol  the  name  of  (Courtney  boldly  seated  himself 
in  the  .Si)eaki;r's  chair,  and  mutter'Ml  something  about  dissolving  iIk;  I'arliament. 
The  otiicrs  then  connnenced  the  work  of  demolishing  all  that  came  before  them, 
sticks  being  thrown  al  the  glass  globes  on  the  gasaliers  whi(  h  were  l)eyond  their 
reach. 

The  cry  f)f  hre  was  now  raised,  and  it  was  discovered  that  the  building  had  been 
fired  by  some  of  the  mob.  The  fire  spread  with  great  rapidity,  and  in  half-an-hour 
the  whole  building  was  wrapped  in  a  sheet  of  (lame.  No  attemjitwas  made  to  save 
the  building,  and  the  engines  were  only  used  u])on  the  surrounding  property.  liy 
this  fire  the  valuable  library,  containing  the  archives  and  records  of  the  colony  for 
over  a  century,  was  completely  di'stroyetl.  'I'he  only  article  saved  was  the  mace 
belonging  to  the  J.ower  House.  The  party  who  saved  the  mace  carried  it  to  Done- 
gani's  Hotel,  and  delivered  it  to  Sir  .Allan  McNab. 

The  mob  now  proceeded  to  the  residence  of  Mr.  r.afonlaine,  and  set  it  on  fire, 
but  through  the  efforts  of  some  of  the  citizens  the  (lames  were  e.vtinguished,  but  the 
whole  of  the  furniture  and  library  was  completely  demolished.  Several  t)llier  houses, 
occupied  by  obnoxious  members  of  the  Parliament,  were  also  destroyed. 

It  was  feared  that  the  (lovernor  might  suffer  from  the  violeme  of  the  mob. 
He  therefore  left  his  residence  at  Monklands  and  remained  in  the  city  under  the  pro- 
tection of  a  military  body. 

On  the  26th.  Messrs.  Mack,  Howard,  I'crri;-.  Montgomery  ;uul  Perry  were 
arrested  on  the  charge  of  arson,  and  were  committed  for  trial.  A  crow&lt;l  of  nearly 
3000  ])ersons  aecf)mi)anied  them  to  gaol,  but  ncj  violence  was  shown. 

The  Parliament  Building  destroyed  during  this  riot  was  originally  the  St.  Ann's 
market,  the  interior  of  which  had  been  remodelled  for  the  accommodation  of  the 
Legislature.  It  was  342  feet  in  length  by  50  in  width,  the  centr.il  portion  projec'ing 
four  feet  beyond  the  wings.     It  was  constructed  of  Montreal  limestone,  and  tiiough

are  exactly  in  the  same  position  as  the  l''rench  paily  during  that  period.  'I'uc)  d.iys 
after  the  ol/iio\ioiis  Hill  had  passed,  a  riot  took  place  and  Colonel  Gngv  was  of  the 
greatest  u.'Je  then  in  calming  the  populace.    ,\n  eye-witness  of  this  thus  (les&lt;rihed  it  : 

"  Having  worsted  the  police,  and  defying  the  troops,  the  jiopulace  assembled 
round  the  (lovernmeiU  House,  l)ent  on  taking  it  by  storm,  and  killing  I^ord  i'llgin. 
who  was  in  it.  Without  Colonel  (lugy  tlu-  attempt  would  liavc  been  made,  J)iit  walk- 
ing coolly  up  and  down  lie  soothed  the  mullitude.  and  persuaded  them  to  desist  .So 
happy  was  he  in  his  manner  of  dealing  with  them  that,  notwithstan(bng  his  oji|)osi- 
tion  to  their  wishes,  they  carried  him  home  on  their  shoulders  in  triumph.  Neither 
the  ])olice  or  the  troops  produced  any  effect  011  the  infuriated  multitude.  IIk 
administratK  11  thereupon  put  muskets  into  the  hands  ot  a  body  of  French  Canadians 
who  weie  drilled  and  intended  fur  the  repressicjii  of  the  Mritish  population.  The 
latter  arming  themselves,  marched  in  a  sort  oi  military  arr.iy  to  attack  the  I'lench. 
and  a  terrible  night  ccjiilhct  was  about  to  take  place  in  the  streets  of  Mont:eal.  I'o 
prevent  it.  a  wing  of  llie  71st  Regiment,  and  two  guns  loaded  with  gra|)e,  were  drawn 
u].,  with  orders  lo  fire  with  effect  on  the  advancing  multitude.  I'he  latter  had 
nearly  rea(  hed  the  limit  assigned  them  l)y  the  officer  commanding,  and  the  lr(joi)s 
were  abcjiit  lo  fire,  when  Cohuiel  (lugy  met  the  crowd  and  threw  himself  into  its 
midst.  Ascending  a  lamji-post.  In:  addressed  them  fc^r  upwards  ol  two  hours  without

the  guillotine,  making  a  speech  with  the  axt'  pendent  over  his  neck.  If  it  be  true,  as 
it  is  tiue,  that  but  for  his  intervention  four  or  live  hundred  natives  of  the  Hritish  Isles 
might  or  would  on  that  occasion  have  lu'eii  slaughtered  b\'  the  troops,  it  is  manifest 
that  the  connection  with  liritain  must  have  been  severed." 

Mr.  Powell  writing  in   the   (^)uebec    Mercury  of  dale  4th   Januaiy,    rS55,  and 
recounting  the  events  of  this  memoraiile  mghl,  thus  says  : 

"  There  is  a  dark  spot  in  the  |)age  of  Canadian  history  ;  the  angry  passions  of 
'^■:l:i  were  roused  by  an  act  which  was  by  them  deemed  to  extend,  not  only  the 
sanction  of  the  law  lo  treason,  rebellion  and  munlei,  but  worse  still--to  reward  them. 
The  spirit  of  those  who  had  lived  obedient  to  law  all  their  lives  rose  in  passionate 
revolt  against  an  enactment  to  their  minds  subversive  of  every  princi])le  of  religion, 
UKjrality  and  law.  The  (lames  of  the  House  in  which  the  slalate  was  passed,  with 
all  the  most  valuable  records  of  the  country,  fearfully  attested  the  state  of  men's 
minds.      It  was  at  such  a  moment,  when   energy  and  determination    were  most  re-

quired,  that  the  energies  of  those  whose  duty  it  was  to  quell  tlie  storm  seemed 
thoroughly  paralyzed.  There  was  one  man,  at  least,  who  proved  an  exception  to 
the  prevailing  cowardice.  That  man  was  Colonel  Giigy.  Dark  as  is  tiic  memory  of 
those  days,  they  would  have  been  darker  still  but  for  him. 

"  Not  only  did  he  throughout  those  tryin^  scenes,  by  his  inHuence,  by  his 
example,  by  his  unwearying  exeition,  restrain  the  passions  of  the  enraged  multi- 
tude, but  on  one  particular  occasion  he  stayed  the  tide  of  riot,  of  bloodshed,  and 
what  might  have  caused  a  rebellion  worse  than  that  'a'htch  had  been  so  lately 
terminated 

''Weil  do  I  remember  the  second  night  af'er  the  Parliament  House  was  burnt, 
when  the  tidings  spread  like  wild-tire  through  the  City,  that  the  Covernment  had  armed 
their  supporters  in  the  suburbs,  and  that  even  at  that  moment  they  were  assembled  at 
Bonsecours  Market.  A  spirit  was  evoked  in  the  breast  of  every  c,  ,)onent  of  such  a 
rash  and  one-sided  act  as  the  arming  of  one  part  of  the  po|nilation  against  the  other, 
that  boded  fearful  results,  had  the  Hame  once  burst  its  bounds.  Arms  were  in  the 
hands  of  every  man  and  boy  who  could  bear  them,  and  a  stern  determination  in  the 
minds  of  all  to  meet  in  deadly  hostility.  The  military  were  drawn  up  across  Notre 
Dame  street,  near  Jacques  Cartier  Square,  cutting  off  communication  by  that  street. 
It  was  at  this  time,  when  all  were  resolved  to  force  their  way  through  the  armed 
troojjs  to  reach  the  Bonsecours  Market,  that  (iugy  appeared  amongst  them,  and 
from  the  paling  on  which  I  was  standing  by  his  side,  addressed  the  assembled  mul- 
titude, and  by  his  commanding  eloquence,  his  boldness,  his  energy  and  strong  com- 
mon sense,  succeeded  in  allaying  the  popular  excitement,  and  inducing  all  to  dis- 
perse in  quiet  to  their  homes.  Had  he  nut  been  the  instrument  ir,  the  hands  of  that 
Power  who  rules  over  all.  He  alone  knows  what  might  have  been  the  consequence  of 
the  shedding  of  the  blood  which  must  have  flowed  on  that  night. 

•'  Up  to  the  present  lime,  I  have  never,  amid  all  the  obliquy  which  has  been 
heai)ed  upon  his  name,  seen  one  word  of  tribute  in  justice  to  conduct  which  was  as 
honorable  to  the  man,  as  invaluable  to  our  common  country.  Such  is  the  testimony 
of  an  eye-witness.  Under  a  lamp  elevated  about  ten  teet.  above  an  armed  and 
infuriated  mob,  in  the  full  glare  of  the  light,  hearing  the  imprecations  of  the  frantic 
multitude  around  him,  varied  by  the  occasional  flash  of  fire-arms  and  the  whistling  of 
a  ball,  Colonel  Gugy  was  a  mark  which  no  man  could  miss.  He  could  at  any 
moment  have  been  killed,  even  with  a  bvick  bat,  and  as  every  man  has  his 
friends  and  his  enemies,  he  must  have  felt  that  his  time  was  at  hand.  He  knew 
that  within  a  hundred  and  fifty  yards  were  two  guns  charged  with  grape — and 
upward  of  200  soldiers  with  guns  loaded  and  capped,  and  he  must  have  heard 
the  officer  in  conuiiand  press  on  the  troops  the  necessity  of  firing  with  effect. 
He  must  have  felt  that  any  half  dozen  imprudent  or  drunken  fellows  might  have 
brought  all  the  fire  upon  him.  Vet,  for  two  long  hours  and  more,  despite  con- 
tinual interruption,  he  never  faltered.  Avoiding  all  irritating  topics — gently 
insinuating  respect   for  order — appealing   to   the   hearts  of  his  audience — drawing

affecting  picliircs  of  desolated  lieaitlis,  widowed  mothers,  and  helpless  orphans — 
soothing  this  one.  cracking  a  joke  with  another,  then  provoking  the  laugh  which 
indicates  the  calming  down  of  irritation,  he  eventually  induced  the  assembled  thou- 
sands peaceably  to  disperse.  He  performed  the  same  part  on  several  evenings, 
always  at  more  or  less  risk,  and  it  is  undeniable  tlvit  it  was  owing  to  his  efforts  that 
no  blood  was  shed. 

■'On  the  night  above  referred  to,  considering  the  proximity,  number,  and  dispo- 
sition of  the  soldiery,  with  the  dense  mass  of  closely  packed  thousands  in  the  street, 
no  one  can  affect  to  rale  the  killed  and  wounded,  had  the  troops  fired,  otherwise 
than  by  hundreds."  '  - 

In  March,  1855,  an  Industrial  E.xhibition  was  held  in  the  City  Concert  Hall  for 
the  purpose  of  selecting  articles  to  be  sent  to  the  Paris  Exhibition.  It  was  publicly 
inaugurated  by  His  Excellency  Sir  Edmund  Head,  the  (lovernor-General,  who 
^■isited  Montreal  for  the  first  time  (for  that  purpose)  on  March  5th.  This  visit  was 
celebrated  in  the  most  enthusiastic  manner,  and  every  possible  effort  was  made  to 
render  it  agreeable. 

In  August,  1857,  Montreal  was  visited  by  the  most  distinguished  company  tliat 
ever  met  in  the  Provinces.  On  \V'ednesday,  12th.  the  "American  Association  for  the 
Advancement  of  Science  "  assemb!.  J  in  the  C^ourl  House,  and  continued  in  session 
for  one  week.  On  Thursday  evening,  a  soiree  was  given  by  the  Natural  History 
Society,  in  the  City  Concert  Hall,  and  was  numerously  attended.  On  Saturday,  by 
invitation  of  the  officers  of  the  garrison,  the  party  visited  St.  Helen's  Island.  On  the 
Monday  following,  a  Conversazione  was  given  by  the  Governors,  i""aculty  and  Fellows 
of  McGill  College,  and  was  a  magnificent  affair.  At  the  closing  meeting  of  the 
Af;SOciation,  addresses  were  given  by  ex-President  P'ilmore,  Professors  Henry,  Swal- 
low, Ramsay,  Caswell,  and  other  celebrities.  One  of  tliese  speakers  congratulated 
the  citizens  on  possessing  such  a  city,  and  staled  that  there  was  "  a  power  stored  up 
here  upon  the  shores,  which,  within  less  than  one  hundred  years,  will  probably  result 
in  making  this  city  the  greatest  city  in  America.  This  immense  water  power  being 
directed  to  the  maniif;xctures  which  might  be  established  here,  will  make  this  one  of 
the  great  cities  of  the  globe." 

On  Tuesday,  4lh  January,  1859,  the  Bishop's  Church,  St.  Denis  street,  was 
destroyed  by  fire. 

The  formal  opening  of  the  \Mctoria  Bridge  was,  in  colonial  importance,  the  chief 
feature  in  the  visit  of  the  Prince  of  Wales  to  Montreal.  As  an  engineering  triumph 
over  natural  difficulties  of  the  most  stupendous  kind  it  is  without  its  equal  in  the 
world. 

While  the  city  was  in  the  midst  of  excitement  on  account  of  the  seizure  of  Mason 
and  Slidell,  an  event  occurred  which  tended  to  throw  a  sadness  over  its  inhabitants- 
On  Tuesday,  December  24th,  the  news  was  spread  that  the  husband  of  our  beloved 
Queen  had  suddenly  died.  A  large  meeting  of  the  citizens  was  held  at  the  City 
Concert  Hall,  and  adopted  an  address  of  condolence  to  Her  Majesty,  for  which  she 
returned  her  thanks. 


•92  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAL, 

111  July,  1862,  the  Oovciiioi-dcnoral,  I^ord  Moiick,  paid  his  first  visit  to  the 
city,  and  was  hospitably  entertained  by  the  Corporation,  who  presented  an  address 
of  welcome,  and  provided  every  jjossible  means  towards  rendering  his  visit  agreeable. 

One  of  the  most  important  trials  ever  held  in  Montreal  v/as  that  of  the  St. 
Albans'  Raiders.  During  the  terrible  fratricidal  war  between  the  Northern  States  of 
America  and  the  Southern,  a  band  of  )oiiiig  men,  sworn  soldiers  of  the  Confederate 
Army,  entered  from  Canada  the  Stale  of  \'ermont  and  raided  tiie  town  of  St.  Albans, 
in  that  State,  and  after  committing  certain  acts  of  violence,  escaped  back  to  Canada 
with  their  spoil.  The  account  has  been  culled  principally  from  the  History  of  the 
Trial,  by  1..  N.  JJenjamin.  The  names  of  those  incarcerated  and  tried  for  this 
offence  and  acquitted  were  Jk'nnell  H.  Young,  S.  E.  Lackey,  Marcus  Spurr,  A.  Pope 
Bruce,  C.  M.  Swager,  C.  McD.  AN'allace,  Joseph  McCirorty,  George  Scott,  W,  H. 
Hutchinson,  Dudley  Moore,  T.  B.  Collins,  J.  A.  Doty,  S.  S.  (iregg,  and  S,  T. 
Teavis.  'J'hese  men,  according  to  their  commitment,  robbed  tlie  Bank  of  St.  Albans 
of  $70,000,  and  one  man,  a  depositor  at  the  time,  of  $300.  The  best  array  of  legal 
talent  that  the  Province  could  produce  was  enlisted  on  both  sides,  but  it  must  be 
averred  that  the  prisoners'  counsel  carried  the  day,  und  were  comi&gt;letely  sustained  by 
the  Privy  Council  of  England.  When  the  case  was  opened  on  November  2nd,  1864, 
the  (-ourt  was  crowded.  Hon.  Mr.  Abbott,  Q.C.,  Hon.  Mr.  Laflamme,  Q.C.,  and 
Mr.  Kerr,  Q.C..  we.'e  the  lawyers  wiio  api)earcd  for  the  St.  Albans'  raiders.  Mr. 
Devlin,  Q.C.,  apjieared  for  the  United  States  Government,  Mr.  Johnson,  Q.C.,  now 
Sir  Francis  Johnson,  Ciiief  Justice  of  the  Court  of  Review,  and  Mr.  Carter,  Q.C., 
represented  the  Ci&lt;jwn  ;  Mr.  Strachan  Betluine,  Q.C.,  Hon.  John  Rose,  Q.C.,and 
Mr.  Ritchie.  Q.C..  were  also  connected  with  the  trial. 

It  began  before  Judge  Coursol,  who  dismissed  the  prisoners,  as  he  held  he  had 
no  jurisdiction  ;  then  coming  before  Hon.  Judge  Smith,  after  a  long  and  most  careful 
examination  of  facts  and  documents,  and  after  speeches  remarkable  on  all  sides  for 
terseness,  fluency  and  fervor.  His  Honor  concluded  and  discharged  the  prisoners. 

1  now  come  to  one  of  the  most  stirring  periods  of  the  history  of  the  country  and 
of  the  City  of  Montreal. 

This  was  the  disgraceful  invasion  by  a  body  of  men,  called  Fenians,  of  Canada 
contrary  to  all  international  law. 

For  some  time  during  the  early  part  of  the  year  1866  the  attention  of  the  authorities 
had  been  directed  towards  the  movements  of  an  organization  e.xisting  principally  in 
the  United  States,  and  known  as  the  "  Fenian  Brotherhood,"  whose  design  was  the 
liberation  of  Ireland  from  British  rule.  At  its  organization,  and  for  a  considerable 
time  afterwards,  little  attention  was  paid  to  threats  made  by  its  leaders,  but  when  they 
proceeded  so  far  as  to  threaten  the  peace  and  safety  of  the  country,  the  authorities 
made  prejjaration  whereby  they  might  be  able  to  repel  an  attack  made. 

A  short  account  of  the  proceedings  of  June,  when  Pigeon  Hill  was  first 
brought  prominently  before  the  Canadian  people,  will  now  be  given. 

When  it  was  known  throughout  Montreal  and  district  that  the  Fenians  were

actually  attempting  to  invade  Canada,  the  utmost  indignation  i)revailed.  When  ilic 
British  troops  arrived  at  St.  Armand's  Station  bel^vecn  eleven  and  twelve  o'clock  of 
the  9th  June,  they  found  two  wagons  which  arrived  from  Pigeon  Hill  with  five 
Fenian  prisoners,  who  had  been  captured  that  morning  by  different  parties.  "  These,'' 
writes  one  present,  "  were  little  scamps  such  as  one  sees  about  the  streets  of  all  great 
cities.  One  was  a  tolerably  stout,  resolute  looking  fellow  ;  another,  a  mild  looking 
young  man  much  belter  dressed  than  the  rest." 

'I'hese  men  were  left  in  the  custody  of  the  St.  Armantl's  volunteers,  and  the 
column  of  attack  on  the  Fenians  at  Pigeon  Hill  started  at  two  p.m.  The  (Jranby 
and  Waterloo  volunteers,  commanded  by  Captain  Millard,  formed  the  advance  "uard 
being  followed  by  two  twelve  pounder  Armstrong  guns  of  Captain  Balfour's  Battery, 
Royal  Artillery,  then  stationed  in  Hochelaga,  accompanied  with  their  regular  (iiiota 
of  artillery  guns,  commanded  by  Captain  Pliipps,  R.A.  These  were  followed  by 
two  companies  of  the  Rifle  Brigade  under  Major  Nixon,  who  commanded  the  whole 
column,  also  two  companies  of  the  25th  Regiment,  then  stationed,  as  well  as  the  Ritle 
Brigade,  in  Montreal.  x\nother  company  uf  the  25th  brought  up  the  rear  and  formed 
the  rear  guard. 

Between   the   main  body  and  rear  guard,  the   supply  wagon   and   a    farmer's 
wagon,  carrying  the  surgeon's  apparatus  and  medical  comforts,  were  placed. 

The  officers  and  men  were  in  the  highest  spirits,  only  fearing  lest  the  redoubt- 
able Fenians  should  seek  shelter  too  promptly  in  the  United  States,  the  "  lines  " 
being  only  half  a  mile  from  their  camp.  The  day  was  very  fine,  the  sun  was  shining 
brightly,  yet  tempered  by  a  cool  breeze.  Tliis  made  the  roads  dry  and  the  marching 
pleasant.  One  thing  regarding  this  march  must  not  be  passed  over.  Although 
several  .soldiers  of  the  Line  and  Rifles  were  knocked  up  with  the  march  and  obliged 
to  fall  out,  yet  sucli  was  the  pluck  and  training  of  our  volunteers,  and  they  were  the 
advanced  guard  and  in  front  of  the  strong  Artillery  horses  of  Cai)tain  Balfour's 
Battery,  not  one  single  man  evinced  the  least  fatigue,  but  kept  straight  ahead.  A 
short  halt  was  made  at  a  place  called  Holt's  Corners  and  another  jirisoner  was 
brought  in  from  the  south  road,  having  been  captured  by  a  farmer,  who,  with  his  son 
and  hired  man,  had  been  reconnoitering  the  enemy.  The  Fenian  was  mounted  on 
a  handsome  horse,  and  was  rather  of  a  gentlemanly  and  refined  appearance.  He  was 
speedily  dismounted,  being  succeeded  in  the  saddle  by  Captain  Hallowes  of  the  25th 
Regiment,  and  the  Fenian  was  conducted  to  the  rear  in  charge  of  a  guard  from  that 
Regiment.  Another  prisoner  was  soon  met,  squatted  in  a  single  wagon  between  the 
feet  of  two  farmers  of  Stanbridge,  who  had  captured  him.  Just  before  the  column 
reached  Pigeon  Hill  there  was  the  cry  "  Incline  to  the  right"  and  that  splendid  body 
of  horsemen  "  The  Guides,"  under  Captain  I).  Lorn  McDougall,  dashed  past  in 
single  file  and  took  their  place  in  front.  They  had  no  opportunity  that  day  and 
more  is  the  pity  to  "  flesh  their  maiden  swords  "  upon  any  large  body  of  Fenians. 
But  they  rode  round  by  the  Cook's  Corner's  Road,  and  at  a  later  period  of  the  day 
cut  off  the  retreat  of  some  who  would  have  escaped  and  took  two  of  the  miserable

scoundrels  prisoners.  If  ilie  Fenians  had  a  good  sight  of  thoni,  and  they  had  from 
their  position,  they  must  have  felt  inclined  to  keej)  out  of  their  way.  In  turning  to 
the  right  at  the  tavern  at  Pigeon  Hill,  the  whole  column  descended  the  hill  on  the 
road  leading  directly  to  the  lines,  the  Artillery  taking  the  lead.  The  guns  were 
placed  in  position  on  a  high  point  overlooking  the  whole  valley  in  the  direction  of 
the  woods  and  about  half  a  mile  from  tlvi  lines.  The  company  of  the  25th  remained 
with  the  guns,  and  the  remainder  of  the  Infantry  in  two  lines  with  the  Rifles  thrown 
out  in  front  as  skirmishers  descended  into  the  valley.  The  last  red  coat  disappeared 
among  the  trees,  and  presently  a  single  rifle  shot  was  heard  echoing  loudly  enough 
through  the  woods,  two  more  followed,  tiien  a  dripping  fire  of  musketry  and  all  was 
silent. 

At  the  first  report  every  one  sprang  to  his  feet.  The  gunners  placed  themselves 
by  their  i)ieces,  and  the  officers  of  Artillery  prepared  to  point  them  upon  any  body 
of  the  enemy  that  might  break  cover.  The  disappointment  was  very  great  when 
the  firing  ceased. 

Presently  the  red  coats  emerged  from  the  woods,  marched  across  a  small  clear- 
ing and  disappeared  in  the  woods  beyond.  After  wailing  some  time  longer,  and 
the  sun  beginning  to  approach  the  western  horizon,  the  horses  were  put  to  the  guns 
and  wagons,  and  preparations  were  made  for  returning  to  St.  Armand.  One  com- 
pany of  tiie  25111  rejoined  their  comrades  on  the  hill.  The  rest  of  the  force  made 
their  way  by  the  Cook's  Corner's  Road  back  to  Pigeon  Hill  with  the  exception  of 
one  company  of  the  Rifles,  which  was  detached  towards  Frelighsburg.  The  rest  of 
the  force  reached  St.  Armand's  Station  between  nine  and  ten  o'clock  at  night. 

In  the  early  part  of  1868  the  mutterings  of  a  new  Fenian  excitement  were  again 
heard  on  our  borders,  and  after  an  inteival  of  nearly  two  years  of  peace  and  quiet, 
we  were  once  more  threatened  by  an  invasion.  As  in  the  previous  case,  this  report 
was  the  result  of  the  unfriendly  feelings  existing  between  the  United  States  and 
England.  But,  fortunately  for  Canada,  the  resources  of  the  "  Brotherhood  "  were 
not  sufficient  to  enable  them  to  carry  out  their  design  ;  but  while  the  invasion  of  th® 
country  was  abandoned,  still  the  diabolical  spirit  which  animated  many  of  its  par- 
tisans made  good  its  foothold  in  the  country,  and,  as  in  other  places  throughout  the 
world,  those  who  opposed  the  mad  scheme  were  singled  out  as  victims,  and  a  more 
distinguished  victim  could  not  have  been  chosen  than  the  Hon.  Thomas  d'Arcy 
McGee,  a  representative  of  the  City  of  Montreal  in  the  Dominion  Parliament,  who 
was  foully  assassinated  on  the  morning  of  April  ytli.  1868,  while  reluming  from  the 
Parliament  Buildings  to  his  lodgings  in  Ottawa. 

The  funeral  which  took  place  on  Monday,  13th,  will  be  long  remembered.  The 
streets  were  covered  with  mourning  flags  and  festoons  of  black,  giving  the  scene  a 
striking  and  funereal  aspect,  and  those  streets  through  which  the  procession  was  to 
pass  were  lined  on  either  side  by  soldiers,  regulars  and  volunteers. 

On  Friday,  September  nth,  1868,  His  Lordship  Bishop  Fulford,  the  first  Angli- 
can Bishop  of  the  Diocese  of  Montreal,  died  at  his  residence  after  a  i)ainful  illness ^ 
and  was  binied  in  Mount  Royal  Cemetery. 


HISTORV    OK    MONTREAL.  99 

On  I'liday,  llic  8tli  of  (October,  1869,  Prince  Arthur,  tlurd  son  of  Her  Most 
Gracious  Majesty,  arrived  in  Montreal  to  join  the  P. CO.  Ritks,  here  stationed,  lie 
holding  a  lieutenant's  commission  in  that  splendid  regiment. 

His  Kxcellency  the  Governor-General,  having  left  Canada  for  England,  Sir  John 
Michel  was  sworn  in  at  Montreal  as  Administrator  of  the  Government  in  tlie-absence 
of  the  Governor-General.     Sir  John  look  u])  his  ro-sidence  in  the  city,  and  curing  his 
administration  the  Executive  Council  met  here  twice  in  each  month  for  the  trans- 
action of  public  business. 

I  now  come  to  what  is  called  the  second  Fenian  Invasion,  and  it  seems  the 
result  of  the  first  had  no  effect  on  these  men.  About  .Vpril  loth,  1870.  an  intima- 
tion was  received  by  the  Dominion  Government  from  the  l&gt;ritish  Minister  at  Wash- 
ington to  the  effect,  that  tlie  American  Executive  had  received  warning  of  an  in- 
tended Eenian  raid  into  Canada  along  the  frontier  from  Port  Huron  to  St.  A'ban's. 
Later  on,  information  was  received  that  the  intended  raid  would  not  be  made  at  the 
place  indicated,  but  that  all  the  Fenians  were  concentrating  at  Malone,  a  town  on 
the  north  side  of  the  Stale  of  New  York  and  near  to  the  frontier,  and  that  they 
intended  making  a  raid  on  St,  .Armand  and  Frelighsburg.  In  consetiuencc  of  this 
information  several  frontier  corps  were  oidered  to  hold  themselves  in  readiness  for 
immediate  action,  and  by  the  end  of  the  week  all  the  battalions  so  ordered  were 
under  arms.  From  Montreal  on  the  Monday  following  this  information  Muir's 
troop  of  Cavalry  was  ordered,  and  they  arrived  at  Huntingdon  on  Tuesday  after- 
noon. Col.  Chamberlain  had  already  gone  to  Missisquoi  to  bring  out  the  force 
under  his  command,  whilst  a  large  force  was  collected  of  the  Volunteers  in  Montreal. 
During  the  following  week  the  streets  of  Montreal  appeared  gay  with  marching 
troops  and  sounds  of  martial  music  from  the  many  bands  which  were  moving  to  and 
from  the  execution  of  their  military  duties.  Rumors  were  plentiful,  but  not  until 
H.  M.  (j.  Majesty's  Birthday  following  were  the  rumors  turned  into  fact.  The 
celebration  of  the  Queen's  Birthday  was  interrupted  by  a  call  for  the  Regulars  and 
Volunteers  to  move  to  the  front.  Word  was  received  that  the  I'enians  were  massing 
both  at  St.  Alban's  and  Malone,  as  well  as  in  Upper  Canada  on  the  Niagara  frontier, 
and  also  at  the  Town  of  Prescotl.  St.  Johns  and  Frelighsburg  were  at  once  well 
garrisoned  by  troops  from  Montreal,  Fort  Wellington  at  Prescotl  was  garrisoned  by 
the  Ottawa  Volunteers,  and  every  thing  was  done  to  protect  the  frontier  of  Canaua 
from  the  lawless  raljble. 

U'he  day  after  the  (Queen's  Birlhday.  viz.,  25111  May,  a  band  of  over  two  hundred 
of  these  misguided  men,  under  the  command  of  one  O'Neil,  crossed  the  frontier  and 
entered  Canada,  trying  to  effect  a  lodgment  at  J'igeon  Hill.  Many  hundreds  of 
Fenians  were  in  and  about  St.  Alban's  during  this  time.  Also  there  were  large 
bodies  of  them  arrived  at  Malone  and  elsewhere.  'I'he  proclamation  of  General 
G..  lit.  the  President  of  the  United  St-^.tes,  rather  disconcerted  their  plans,  whilst  on 
the  nii'Miing  of  the  26th,  a  finely  equipped  little  army  of  itself  in  the  shape  of  the 
Prince  Consort's  Own   Rifles  (Regulars)  of  seven  hundred  strong,  under  command 


ij6  HISTORY  OF  MONTREAl,. 

of  Lord  A.  Russell,  and  accompanied  by  Prince  Arlluir,  went  by  special  train  to  Si. 
Johns,  where  the  Volunteers  had  preceded  them,  (ieneral  Lindsay  assumed  com- 
mand of  the  whole.  Col.  Smilli  with  a  detachment  of  the  6oth  arrived  at  Stan- 
bridge,  and  left  early  next  morning  with  Col.  Chamberlains  Corps  for  Cook's 
C(&gt;rners,  the  old  I'eiiian  camping  ground.  When  they  arrived  there,  they  foimd  that 
the  Homeguard  was  already  on  the  spot,  recruited  only  the  day  before  by  Col. 
Weslover.  and  a  few  other  loyal  and  spirited  farmers  and  gentlemen  living  on  the 
borders,  who  took  upon  themselves  the  iluty  of  defendinj;  their  hejrtlis  and  homes, 
waiting  the  arrival  of  regular  troops. 

General  Lindsay  disposed  of  all  his  forces  at  the  best  available  spots,  but  it  was 
only  here  that  any  lighting  took  place,  as  all  the  f)ther  bands  of  Fenians  tied  when- 
ever they  were  opposed  to  the  regular  troops  of  Her  Majesty  or  the  Car.adian  Vol- 
unteers. All  along  the  frontier  at  Cook's  Corners,  the  Fenians  had  scattered  their 
arms  and  ammunition  in  their  hurry,  ami  it  is  supposed  on  good  authority  that  over 
a  thousand  men  were  at  this  time  either  on  Canadian  soil  or  near  it  in  the  frontier. 

Disregarding  the  proclamation  of  the  Government  of  the  United  .States,  and  the 
Marshal  then  there  recpiestnig  him  not  to  proceed,  O'Neil  with  Donnelly,  his  second 
In  command,  crossed  the  lines  into  Canada.  The  Homeguards  were  posted  on  the 
hill  side,  about  five  hundred  yards  from  the  American  line.  On  the  Queen's  Birth- 
day and  on  the  follt&gt;\ving  morning  they  were  joined  by  a  portion  of  the  forces  under 
Col.  Smith  and  Lieut. -Col.  Chamberlain.  'J'he  whole  number  of  the  Canadian 
troops  did  not  here  exceed  seventy  men,  though  anii)le  reserves  were  in  waiting  at 
])oints  near  at  hand.  About  noon  the  Fenians  moved  onwards,  and  actually  m  a 
body  crossed  the  lines.  The  liurlington  (V^t.)  Company  of  Fenians  dashed  down 
to  form  a  skirmish  line  across  a  little  brook  that  flowed  between  the  combatants. 
The  moment  they  crossed,  the  Homeguards  and  others  opened  fire,  one  man  was 
instantly  killed  and  others  wounded.  The  Fenians  wavered  and  fell  back.  Another 
company  tried  and  too  receded,  and  it  so  resulted  that,  from  the  sharp  firing  of  the 
Canadians,  no  Fenian  dared  to  approach  the  bridge,  and  all  fell  into  confusion  and  a 
stampede.  In  the  afternoon  they  again  attempted  to  cross,  losing  one  man  killed 
and  several  wounded,  though  the  actual  number  could  never  be  ascertained.  O'Neil 
and  the  other  leaders  were  then  taken  prisoners  by  the  L'.  S.  Marshal  and  driven 
off  to  St.  Alban's  Gaol.     Thus  collapsed  the  Fenian  raid  of  1870  at  Cook's  Corners. 

On  the  21st  November,  1872,  the  ceremony  of  formally  presenting  to  the  city 
the  statue  of  Our  (rracious  Majesty  tiie  Queen  was  performed  by  Lord  Dufferin,  the 
Governor  General. 

In  1873,  Sir  George  E.  Cartier  died  in  London,  and  his  funeral  in  Montreal  was  the 
largest  ever  seen  in  the  city.  The  expenses  of  his  obsequies  were  borne  by  the 
Dominion  Government. 

In  1875,  the  Guibord  burial  case  occasioned  some  ill-feeling  in  Montreal,  btit  by 
the  energetic  action  of  Dr.  Kingston,  the  Mayor,  all  passed  off  without  any  actual 
disturbance. 


IlISTURY    OF    MONIRKAL.  97 

In  Movcmber,  1878,  the  Marquis  of  Lome  and  the  Princess  T,oi'ise  arrived  in 
the  ciiy.  (ircat  rejoicings  showed  tiie  wclcoine  which  every  one  gave  to  tlie  (Jiieen's 
daughter. 

During  the  jjasl  ten  or  twelve  years,  tlie  city  has  steadily  increased,  and  its  boun- 
daries are  extending  in  every  direction.  Among  the  |)rin(;i|)al  items  and  events  of 
the  past  few  years  may  be  mentioned  the  Kiel  RebeUion  in  the  North  West,  wiien 
two  MtMitrcal  regiments  were  sent  to  tl-.e  scene  of  the  ujirising — tiie  (larrison  Artil- 
lery and  the  65th  ;  the  first  an  English,  the  second  a  l''ren  'i-(Janadian  ciMjis. 

During  the  summer  of  [885,  the  Small-ro.v  epidemic  was  of  such  magnitude 
that  several  thousand  fell  victims  to  its  scourge,  the  mosi  noted  being  the  late  well- 
known  politician,  Honorable  Sir  Francis  Hincks. 

Tlie  execution  of  Louis  Riel,  after  the  close  of  the  Rebellion,  caused  great 
excitement  in  Montreal,  hapijiiy  without  any  serious  outbreak,  although  thousands 
met  on  the  Champ  de  ALirs  and  passed  condemnatory  resolutions. 

A  greai  bridge,  built  by  the  C.  P.  Railway,  has  been  erected  at  l.achiiu;  within

is  recorded  in  the  title  page  of  this  History — shoulder  to  shoulder,  their  city  will  yet 
be,  not  the  seventh,  as  it  now  is,  but  the  tourth  in  size  of  all  the  cities  on  the  Ameri- 
can Continent,  when  the  first  decade  of  the  twenlietii  century  has  come  and  gone.

helped.  What  the  AuJior  has  particularly  striven  to  do  is,  so  to  jiiace  the  photo-

Considerable  prominent  e  is  given  to  the  female  writers  and  singers  of  Montreal,  as 
in  a  work  of  this  kind  they  should  be  honorably  mentioned  as  well  as  the  male  writers, 
poets  and  savants. 

In  connection  with  these  Biographies  a  vast  amount  of  information,  not  gen-

age  (jf  eighty-seven,  after  having  lived  some  fifty-four  years  in  this  city.  I'lu-  Mayor 
went  to  school  until  about  fifteen  years  of  age  if)  Mr.  Daniel  .Mahoney,  a  good  old 
Irish  master,  one  of  the  leadmg  teachers  at  that  lime,  many  of  whose  pupils  have 
since  distinguished  themselves,  and  whu  have  held  ami  occupied  leading  positions 
all  over  tht-  rountry.  Mr.  McShane  afterwards  linislu'd  hi.s  studies  ;il  the  Sulpician 
College,  then  situated  on  College  street,  but  which  has  since  been  transferred  to  that 
magnificent  edificeon  Sherbrooke  sireet  west. 

He  began  business  early  in  hfe,  at  about  eighteen  years  of  age.  with  his  father, 
who  Wcis  then  the  most  extensive  cattle  dealei,  packer  and  exporter  of  meals  in 
Montreal,  i'iiey  had  the  contract  for  supplies  to  the  .Mian  line  and  other  steamers 
coming  to  our  port,  and  also  supplied  Her  .Majesty's  troops  for  about  four  years 
previous  to  their  departiu'e  from  Canada. 

About  1S70  lie  retired  from  this  business,  when  he  began  operating  largely  (on 
St.  Kranyois  Xavier  street)  in  Moiitreal  Hank  and  other  local  stocks,  besides  carrying 
on  an  extensive  business  in  Kvw  ^'o^k  slocks  and  in  Chicago  ])ork  and  grain,  in  which 
business  he  is  still  engaged.  In  September,  1874,  he,  with  Mr.  Roddick,  of  Liverpool, 
began  the  .shipping  of  cattle  from  Canada  and  the  United  Slates  to  England,  being  the 
pioneers  of  a  trade  which  has  grown  since  to  such  immense  proportions,  and  which 
is  now  classed  arnongsl  the  largest  ex])orts  of  the  country.  He  lias  had  as  many  as 
ten  to  fifteen  steamers  on  the  Atlantic  at  one  time,  loaded  with  cattle. 

The  honorable  gentleman  was  an  alderman  of  Montreal,  representing  St.  Ann's 
Ward  for  over  twenty  years,  and  has  occiii)ied  many  prominent  positions  in  the 
City  Council  :  chairman  of  City  Hall  and  Market  Committees,  member  of  the  Roads, 
Finance  and  other  important  Committees.  He  is  at  present  a  member  of  the 
Chicago  and  Montreal  Boards  of  Trade,  member  of  the  Montreal  Harbor  Board, 
director  of  St.  Bridget's  Asylum,  a  governor  of  the  Montreal  (leneral  Hospital, 
member  of  tiie  Provincial  Legislature  for  Montreal  West  and  Centre  since  1877, 
having  twice  been  elected  by  acclamation,  in  1887  and  1890.  In  1887,  at  the  downfall 
of  the  Conservative  Government  at  Quebec,  he  was  called  by  the  Mercier  Adminis. 
tration  to  accept  the  portfolio  of  Minister  of  Pidjlic  Works  and  Agriculture,  which 
position  he  held  for  nearly  two  years,  but  retired  fiom  it  as  he  did  not  agree  with  a 
certain  element  of  the  Cabinet. 

In  politics  Mr,  McShane  is  a  strong  Liberal — one  of  the  old  school.  While 
Minister  of  Public  Works  he  provided  and  gave  out  immense  work  to  the  poor  of 


102  GAZETTEER    OF  MONTREAL. 

Quebec  during  tlic  hard  winters  of  1887  .ind  1888.  He  is  as  popular  in  Quebec  as 
in  Montreal.  He  is  a  born  i^olilician,  faithful  to  his  friends,  and  his  popularity  and 
success  are  due,  amongst  other  reasons,  to  thai  liberality  of  disposition  which  en- 
ables him  by  the  generosity  of  his  acts  to  win  the  esteem  of  every  one  with  whom 
he  comes  in  contact.  It  is  this  same  trait  of  character  which  has  made  him  so  many 
staunch  friends. 

He  is  so  ready  to  oblige  the  man  who  has  recently  voted  against  and  op- 
posed him,  that  it  can  be  instanced  in  thousands  of  cases  where  those  who  had 
been  for  years  ranged  against,  now  think  with  and  vote  u\)on  the  same  side  as  the 
Honorable  Member  for  Montreal  Centre.  In  all  his  transactions  through  life  his 
word  once  given  has  never  been  broken,  and  in  dealing  with  the  pcoi)le  as  a  busi- 
ness man,  he  has  treated  Conservative  and  l,iberal  alike.  No  man  was  kept  out  of 
work  on  account  of  his  jjoiitics  when  he  appealed  to  him. 

His  reputation  is  not  alone  confined  to  the  city  of  which  he  is  chief  magistrate, 
but  he  is  well  known  in  England,  in  the  United  States  and  throughout  Canada  as  a 
man  of  broad  and  liberal  views.  He  has  always  been  an  ardent  and  fearless  cham- 
pion for  the  masses,  and  he  is,  perhaps,  more  widely  known  as  the  "  People's  Jimmy." 

In  Parliament,  when  Montreal's  interests  were  ever  contirned,  he  has  always 
been  faithful  to  his  native  city,  even  against  his  own  party ;  and  the  people  of  Mont- 
real, irrespective  of  creed  or  parly,  recognizing  his  ability,  outspoken  honesty,  vigor 
and  earnestness,  called  upon  him  last  year  to  accept  the  highest  honor  at  their 
bestowal,  that  of  the  Mayoralty.  Mr.  McShane,  acceding  to  the  request  of  his  fellow- 
citizens,  came  forward  as  a  candicate  for  tlial  important  office,  and,  although  ojiposed 
byai)owerful  and  popular  man,  Ex-Mayor  Grenier,  he  received  the  largest  majority 
(nearly  6000  votes)  ever  given  to  a  Montreal  Mayor. 

The  ])la!form  he  laid  down  when  a  candidate  he  has  carried  out  to  the  very  letter, 
opi)using  jobbery  and  corruption  in  all  departments  of  civic  ii.hninistration.  Close 
and  assiduous  attention  to  the  public  weal  has  given  him  a  name  that  has  come  to 
few  in  our  midst.  In  his  position  as  Mayor  of  Montreal  he  has  shown  himself  to 
be  a  liberal  and  gracious  host  to  the  visitors  from  England  and  the  United  States 
and  Canada,  and  in  thus  discharging  his  social  duties  he  has  done  credit  to  his  city 
and  its  people.  The  large  daily  levees  which  he  holds  are  an  evidence  of  the  confi- 
dence reposed  in  !iim  by  all  classes.  The  poor  people  go  there  to  consult  him  on 
their  temporal  troubles.  His  kindness  to  the  distressed  is  cliaracteristic,  and  many 
a  "  God  bless  you  "  has  been  showered  upon  him.  He  has  always  devoted  a  great 
deal  of  his  time  and  attention  to  all  charitable  institutions  of  whatever  denomi- 
nation. His  presence  has  conduced  in  a  great  degree  to  their  success,  and  they 
have  all  had  occasion  to  remember  Mayor  McShane's  magnetic  influence  at  their 
festivities  and  reunions. 

Mr.  McShane  was  married  twice  :  first  in  1863  to  Elizabeth  Jane  Darragh  of 
Montreal  ;  she  died  on  26th  June,  1867,  leaving  one  child  ;  and  in  January,  1868,  he 
married  Miss  Josephine  Kathleen  Mirom,  of  Plattsburg,   New  York,  U.S.A.;  but 


GAZETTEER   OF    MONTREAL.  IO3 

though  of  Plattsburg,  she  has  the  old  French  blood  within  her  veins.  Mrs.  McShane, 
whose  beautiful  artotype  is  at  the  head  of  this  sketch  with  her  husband's,  is  one  of  the 
best  known  ladies  in  the  social  circles  of  Montreal.  And  there  is  this  to  be  said 
besides,  that  although  her  domestic  duties  are  of  course  those  of  every  mother  and 
housekeeper,  she  nevertheless  never  shirks  from  appearing  publicly  when  her  hus. 
band  has  officially  to  appear  in  gatherings  of  all  nationalities  and  demonstrations. 
And  of  all  the  ladies  who  have,  in  the  past,  graced  the  position  of  consorts  to  the 
Mayors  of  Montreal,  none  have  done  more,  none  have  appeared  to  better  advantage, 
none  have  so  effectually  realized  what  a  mayor's  wife  should  be — i)ublicly  and  pro- 
fessionally— than  Mrs.  McShane,  llie  accomplished  wife  of  the  j)resent  Mayor  of 
Montreal. 

DE  maisonneuvl:. 

Paul  Chomedv  De  Maisonneuve  was  the  founder  of  the  City  of  Montreal  in 
1642,  where  he  had  already  settled  some  French  colonists,  and  was  appointed  Gov- 
ernor. In  1647,  he  was  advanced  to  the  governorship  of  the  whole  Province,  and 
succeeded  in  getting  M.  D'Aillebout    appointed  in  his  stead,  when  he  retired. 

A  pension  was  conferred  upon  him  by  the  Seminary  of  Paris,  in  consequence  o^ 
his  important  services  to  the  Church  of  Rome  in  Canada.  After  a  lapse  of  nearly 
250  years  Maisonneuve  appears  to  appeal  to  his  fellow  citizens  as  the  founder  of  their 
city.  A  monument  is  to  be  erected  to  his  memory  in  Place  d'Armes,  and  aided  too 
by  the  Corporation  of  the  City  by  a  substantial  grant.  No  man  deserves  more  of 
his  countrymen  than  he,  as  the  first  Governor  and  founder  of  Montreal,  and  all 
nationality  is  laid  aside  in  the  monument  to  be  erected  to  the  memory  of  him  who 
began  the  city  and  made  it  what  it  now  is — the  Commeicial  Elmporium  of  Canada. 
Much  of  the  life  of  Maisonneuve  is  given  in  the  History  of  Montreal,  in  the  first 
part  of  this  book.  He  well  deserves  all  the  praise  and  public  recognition  which  he 
is  about  to  receive  from  his  fellow  citizens  on  this  250th  anniversary  or  the  5th 
Jubilee  of  the  foundation  of  Villi;  Marie — Montreal. 

CHARLES  LEMOYNE 

Was  the  ist  Baron  de  Longueuil  and  among  the  very  first  persons  born  in 
the  City  of  Montreal,  having  been  born  in  this  city  loth  December,  1656-  On 
account  of  his  bravery,  chivalry  and  life,  he  has  received  the  name  of  "  Le  Machabee 
de  Montreal,"  in  allusion  to  the  brave  family  of  the  Machabees  mentioned  in  the 
Apocrypha  of  the  Bible.  He  distinguished  himself  in  the  war  of  Flanders,  where  he 
immortalized  Canada  and  especially  his  native  city  by  his  heroic  acts  and  military 
fame.  Returning  to  Montreal  he  became  in  1706  "  Major  de  Montreal."  In  1683  he 
married  a  niece  of  one  of  the  first  priests  of  the  city.  He  rendeied  such  great  service 
to  the  Province  at  the  siege  of  Quebec,  1690,  where  he  was  wounded,  also  in  the 
Iroquois  War,  that  Louis  XIV  created  him  a  Baron  with  the  above  title.  Afterwards 
he  was  successively  Governor  of  Three  Rivers  in   1720  and  of  Montreal  in  1724.

He  died  jth  June,  1729,  at  Montreal,  and  he  had  a  magnificent  funeral.  A  true 
Montrcaler — born,  died  and  buried  in  it,  one  of  whom  all  succeeding  citizens  may 
feel  proud. 

CHEVALIER  DE  CALLIERES. 

Louis  Hector  de  ^Callieres  was  a  wise  and  prudent  Governor  of  New  France, 
and  a  gallant  French  military  officer.  Originally,  he  came  from  Torigny  in  Normandy 
to  Canada,  as  a  member  of  the  Montreal  Company,  and  afterwards  became 
Governor  of  this  place.  He  exhibited  great  wisdom  during  the  war,  and  in  his 
relations  with  the  Iroquois,  with  whom  he  concluded  a  peace  in  1701,  at  Montreal. 
He  succeeded  De  Fronienac  in  the  governme  it  of  the  country  in  1698,  and  con- 
tinued to  hold  his  appointment  until  1703. 

Charlevoi.x  does  not  hesit.ite  to  proclaim  him  one  of  the  best  generals  Canada 
ever  j)ossessed  under  Frencii  luic.  " 

LEMOINE  DIBERVILEE 

'•  Was  a  Canadian  navigator,  who  began  the  colonization  of  Louisiana.  Born 
in  Montreal  in  1642,  he  died  in  Havana,  July  9,  1706.  He  was  one  of  seven 
brothers,  who  were  all  active  in  Canadian  affairs  in  the  latter  half  of  the  seventeenth 
century.  He  early  went  to  sea,  and  distinguished  himself  for  bravery  and  ability  as 
a  volunteer  in  the  midnight  attack  on  Schenectady  ;  as  commander  of  the  expedition 
which  recovered  Fort  Nelson  from  the  British  (1686),  and  with  it  the  control  of  the 
Indian  commerce  of  the  region  of  Nelson's  river ;  as  a  successful  invader  of  the  English 
possessions  in  Newfoundland,  and  as  a  victor  in  naval  contests  (1697),  in  spite  of 
icebergs  and  a  shipwreck,  in  Hudson's  Bay.  He  was  reputed  the  most  skilful  naval 
officer  in  the  service  of  France,  when  in  1698  he  was  commissioned  by  the  French 
Government  to  explore  the  mouth  of  the  Mississi])pi,  which  had  never  yet  been 
entered  from  the  sea,  and  to  erect  a  fort  near  it.  With  two  frigates,  two  smaller 
vessels,  a  company  of  marines,  and  about  two  hundred  settlers,  he  set  sail  from 
Rochefort,  October  17,  1698  ;  was  welcomed  at  San  Domingo,  found  Pensacola 
preoccupied  by  Spaniards,  and  cast  anchor,  February  2,  1799,  on  the  Island  of 
Massacre,  near  Mobile.  Accompanied  by  his  brother,  Lemoine  de  Bienville,  a 
Franciscan,  who  had  been  a  companion  of  La  Salle,  and  forty-eight  men,  in  two 
barges,  and  with  provisions  for  fifteen  days,  he  sailed  thence  to  seek  the  Mississippi, 
which  they  entered  2nd  March,  and  ascended  to  the  village  of  the  Bayagoulas. 
They  also  visited  the  Oumas,  among  whom  they  found  a  letter  written  by  Tonty  to 
La  Salle,  in  1684,  and  they  probably  reached  the  mouth  of  the  Red  River.  Returning 
to  the  bay  of  Biloxi,  Iberville  erected  a  fort  as  a  testimony  of  French  jurisdiction, 
the  command  of  which  he  entrusted  to  his  two  brothers,  Sanville  and  Bienville. 
He  himself  sailed  for  France,  but  returned  when  the  French  supremacy  on  the  Mis- 
sissippi was  endangered  by  British  aggression,  and  the  French  Protestant  refugees 
were  seeking  there  an  asylum  after  their  exile  from  France.     He  again  ascended  the

Mississippi  (1700)  as  fiir  as  the  country  of  the  Nachez,  while  his  brotlicr  explored 
western  Louisiana,  crossed  the  Red  R=ver,  and  approached  New  Mexico.  Bilious 
fevers  desolated  the  colonists  at  Biloxi  ;  Sanville  was  a  victim  to  it,  and  the  chief 
command  devolved  on  Bienville;  and  when  Iberville  arrived  with  reinforcements, 
July  22,  1701,  there  were  but  one  hundred  and  fifl.  of  them  alive.  Soon  after,  this 
fortress  was  transferred  to  the  western  bank  of  Mobile  river,  the  first  European 
settlement  in  Alabama.  Iberville  also  constructed  fortifications  on  the  Island  of 
Massacre,  which  he  named  Dauphinc  island,  and  which  became  the  centre  of  the 
colony.  Attacked  by  the  yellow  fe\er,  he  escaped  with  broken  health.  In  1706,  in 
command  of  three  vessels,  he  made  a  descent  upon  the  English  Island  of  Nevis, 
which  he  captured  ;  and  he  died  at  Havana,  on  board  of  his  ship,  on  llie  eve  of  an 
expedition  against  Jamaica." 

CHA'lLbVOIX. 

"  Pierre  Fran(;ois  Xavier  Charlevoix,  a  celebrated  traveller  and  writer,  was  a 
member  of  the  Order  of  Jesuits,  and  was  born  at  St.  Quintin,  in  1684.  He  was  for 
several  years  a  missionary  in  America,  and  more  particularly  in  Canada.  On  his 
return  he  had  a  chief  share  in  the  '•'•Journal  de  l^ravaux  "  for  twenty-four  years. 
He  died  in  1761,  greatly  esteemed  for  his  high  moral  character  and  extensive  learn- 
ing. His  works  are:  '•'■  Histoire  et  Description  Cinerale  du  /upon"  '■' Histoire 
Gcnerale  de  Paraguay,"  "  Histoire  de  PIsle  de  St.  Dominique,''  "  Vie  de  Mere 
Marie  de  V Incarnation,"  and  "  Histore  (Jinerale  de  la  Nouvelle  France.'''  Of  these, 
the  latter  is  the  most  valuable,  describing  his  own  experience,  and  the  manners  and 
customs  of  native  Americans.  He  is  often  quoted  as  a  writer  of  good  authority. 
His  style  is  simple  and  unaffected." 

MARQUIS  DE  VAUDREUIL. 

"Philippe  de  Rigaud,  Marquis  de  Vaudreuil,  a  Lieutenant-General  in  the  French 
army,  and  Governor  of  New  France  for  the  space  of  several  years.  He  was  a  brave 
soldier,  and  had  distinguished  himself  at  the  siege  of  Valenciennes.  He  was  sent  to 
Canada  as  Commander  of  the  Forces,  and  brought  with  him  eight  hundred  men. 
With  three  hundred  of  these  he  went  to  the  relief  of  Montreal  during  the  massacre 
of  Lachine,  and  served  under  De  Frontenac  in  the  grand  expedition  against  the 
Iroquois.  In  1690,  he  was  engaged  in  the  defence  of  Quebec  against  the  attack  of 
Admiral  Phipps.  Three  years  afterwards,  he  surprised  and  defeated  La  Chaudiere 
Noir,  the  most  terrible  and  cunning  of  the  Iroquois.  But  he  gave  up  the  military 
for  the  naval  service,  and  in  1702,  before  inheriting  his  father's  title,  he  obtained  a 
seigniory,  and  was  appointed  Governor  of  Montreal. 

"  He  succeeded  M.  de  Calli^res  in  the  government  of  Canada  in  1703.  He  was 
married  at  Quebec  to  Louise  Elizabeth  Joybert  de  Soulange,  daughter  of  Chevalier 
Joybert  de  Soulange.  This  marriage  was  viewed  with  dissatisfaction  by  the  French 
ministry,  who  did  not  wish  him,  nor  any  of  their  colonial  governors,  to  ally  them- 
selves with  the  residents. 


I06  GAZETTEER   OF   MONTREAL. 

'*  He  displayed  great  activity  in  1710,  in  rhe  defence  of  Quebec — the  expense 
of  which,  however,  was  mainly  borne  by  its  inhabitants ;  and  he  made  preparation 
for  the  relief  of  Montreal. 

"After  the  accession  of  Louis  XV,  he  effected  in  the  colony  numerous  reforms, 
which  were  much  required,  and  the  most  important  were  those  of  improved  educa- 
tion and  civilization.  He  died  at  Quebec  on  the  loth  of  October,  1725,  universally 
regretted  by  the  people  of  the  colony.  His  administration  was  tranquil  ;  and  his 
measures,  whether  civil  or  warlike,  were  usually  crowned  with  success." 

MARQUIS  DE  BEAUHARNOIS. 

*'  Charles,  Marquis  de  Beauharnois,  succeeded  M.  de  Vaudreuil  in  the  gov- 
ernment of  New  France  in  1726,  and  held  that  appointment  for  more  than  twenty 
years — a  fact  which  goes  far  to  prove  his  fitness  and  capacity  for  such  a  high  office. 
He  was  Commodo.e  in  the  Royal  Navy  of  France,  in  which  he  had  gained  distinctic«n 
in  bygone  years,  and  had  filled  some  important  posts  besides. 

'•  During  the  long  and  critical  period  in  which  he  exercised  the  gubernatorial 
functions  in  Canada — although  inundations  and  earthquakes,  death,  famine,  war  and 
sickness  prevailed  and  had  to  be  contended  with — the  French  ministry  had  never 
cause  either  to  reproach  him  for  remissness  of  duty,  or  correct  him  in  his  general 
administration  of  affairs,  except  once,  when  he  took  jjart  in  the  quarrel  between  the 
Clergy  and  the  Cliapter  on  the  occasion  of  the  collision  of  those  parties  relative  to 
the  burial  of  the  body  of  Bishop  de  Valli^res. 

"  In  consequence  of  the  sanguinary  inroads  which  the  Outagamis  were  making  on 
the  unprotected  colonists  throughout  the  country,  he  found  it  necessary,  during  the 
early  part  of  his  administration,  to  give  a  sudden  and  decided  check  to  their  pro- 
ceedings. A  small  army  was  organized,  composed  of  the  colonists,  who  pursued  the 
savages  as  far  as  where  the  City  of  Chicago  now  stands,  and  the  Mississippi.  They 
met  in  with  the  Indians,  and  signally  defeated  them  ;  besides  destroying  their  huts 
and  plantations,  they  indeed  nearly  exterminated  the  cruel  and  unrelentless  red  men 
of  the  tribe  of  the  Outagamis,  while  they  avenged  the  death  of  their  countrymen.  It 
was  a  just  retribution. 

"  When  war  was  declared  between  England  and  France,  and  the  conquest  of 
Canada  and  the  other  French  colonies  resolved  01.  by  the  former,  and  when  only  a 
small  and  feeble  force  was  at  his  disposal,  he  fortified  and  strengthened  the  several 
weak  positions  of  the  country,  and  founded  the  impregnable  Crown  Point.  By  his 
representations  and  entreaties,  he  at  length  prevailed  on  the  French  Ministry  to  send 
an  expedition  to  recapture  Cape  Breton,  and  to  drive  the  English  from  the  West 
Indies.  Had  this  expedition  been  commanded  by  a  rompetent  and  able  officer,  great 
damage  would  certainly  have  been  done  to  our  sea  and  hnid  forces.  As  it  happened, 
the  French  fleet  was  annihilated  by  fierce  and  violent  storms,  which  the  inexperienced 
D'Auville  was  unable  to  contend  against.  Beauharnois  was  succeeded  in  1746  by 
M.  de  la  Jonquiere."

MARQUIS  T)E  VAUDREUIL. 

"PiKr.RK  Francois,  Maniuis  dc  Vaudreuil-Cavagnal,  was  ilu-  last  (lovenior  of 
Canada  iiiuler  French  domination,  and  undoubtedly  one  of  the  best.  He  was  a  son 
of  the  former  dovernor  of  New  France  of  the  same  name,  and  was  l)orn  at  (^)uebcc 
in  1698.  Having  joined  the  military  service  he  rose  to  the  rank  of  Major  in  the 
Marine  Corps.  In  1733  he  was  appointed  Ciovernor  of  Three  Rivers,  and  in  1743 
of  Louisiana,  in  both  of  which  situations  he  was  greatly  popular.  In  1  74^^  he  suc- 
ceeded to  his  father's  title;  and  in  1755  was  elevated  to  the  higli  and  responsible 
appointment  of  Oovernor  of  x\'ew  France, — an  appointment,  which,  if  Montcalm 
and  he  had  acted  in  concert,  and  the  former  had  paid  more  attention  to  the  i)lans 
of  the  latter,  he  would  certainly  have  held  foi  a  much  longer  i)eriod  than  he  did.  The 
jealousy — or  rather,  the  contempt — with  which  Montcalm  regarded  M.de  Vaudreuil 
and  his  valuable  suggestions,  certainly  tended,  in  a  great  measure,  to  hasten  the 
downfall  of  the  French  nation  in  America.  M.  de  Vaudreuil  ever  studied  the  wel- 
fare of  Canada,  and  was  devotedly  attached  to  his  sovereign.  He  would  rather  have 
died  and  sac-ificed  all  he  possessed,  than  tarnish  the  glory  and  honor  of  the  arms 
of  his  country.  He  was  a  true  Frenchman,  bold  and  energetic  in  his  measures, 
and  yet  wise  and  judicious  in  carrying  them  out.  This  was  clearlv  manifested  when 
he  capitulated  to  Amherst  at  Montreal,  notwithstanding  the  intention  of  the  valorous 
De  Levis  to  hold  out  with  his  scanty  forces  to  the  last;  a  determination  which 
De  Vaudreuil  saw  was  hopeless,  and  would  involve  the  needless  destruction  of 
Montreal,  and  the  loss  of  many  valuable  lives.  He  therefore  pursued  the  wisest, 
and  indeed  the  only  course  open  to  him,  and  no  one  can  justly  impeach  his  loyalty 
or  patriotism  in  so  doing. 

''  After  his  return  to  France  he  was  imprisoned  in  the  Bastille  on  some  r'^arges 
preferred  against  him  by  the  friends  of  Montcalm,  but  a  trial  before  the  Chatelet  de 
Paris  exonerated  him  from  these,  and  t'roni  all  blame  in  his  administration  of  the 
affiiirs  of  Canada.  He  was  released  from  imprisonment,  but  stripped  of  nearly  all 
his  worldly  possessions.     He  died  in  1764." 

GENERAL  THOMAS  GAGE 

"  Was  the  last  Ciovernor  of  Massachusetts  by  the  King  of  England.  He  accompanied 
General  Braddock  to  America,  and  was  present  when  that  officer  was  killed.  In 
1760  he  was  made  Governor  of  Montreal,  and  in  1763  was  appointed  Commander- 
in-Chief  of  the  British  Forces  in  North  America,  in  succession  to  treneral  Amherst. 
In  1774  he  was  appointed  Governor  of  Massachusetts,  in  which  office  he  rendered 
himself  very  obnoxious  to  the  people  by  his  arbitrary  proceedings;  and  in  the 
following  year  the  Frovincial  Congress  disqualified  him  from  serving  as  Governor. 
Soon  after  he  returned  to  England,  where  he  died  in  1787."

DUC  DE  LEVIa. 

"Marshal  Di;c  dk  Levls,  although  only  '  Chevalier  de  Levis'  during  the  time 
he  fought  under  Montcahii  in  this  country,  held  the  rank  of  second  in  com- 
mand. He  was  a  most  brave  and  chivalrous  general,  whom  (larneau  declares  superior 
in  many  res|iects  to  Montcalm;  horn  in  1720  at  the  Chateau  d'Anjac  en  Languedoc, 
the  same  birthplace  as  Levy  de  Ventadour,  who  was  Viceroy  of  New  France  in  1625. 
He  liad  early  adopted  the  military  ])rofession,  to  which  he  was  an  honor  and  a  credit  ; 
he  energetically  mastered  every  difficulty  that  lay  in  his  way  or  obstructed  the  fulfil- 
ment of  his  desire  to  become  a  perfect  soldier;  and  the  result  showed  how  well  he 
had  accomi)lished  the  task  wl-.ich  he  had  imposed  on  himself.  He  took  part  al  the 
battle  of  CariUon,  where  he  commanded  the  right  division  ;  as  also  at  Montmorenci, 
where  the  French  repulsed  Wolfe  in  his  endeavor  to  gain  the  fortified  camp  that 
covered  (Quebec.  He  was,  however,  absent  at  Montreal  when  the  first  battle  of 
Quebec  was  fought  ;  and  therefore,  when  Montcalm  fell,  could  not  take  the  command. 
This  was  an  unfortunate  circumstance  for  the  French,  as  they  had  no  one  in  whom 
they  could  place  so  much  confidence  as  in  their  recognized  leader,  De  Levis  ;  the 
army,  consequently,  fell  into  confusion,  and  the  F-nglish  gained  the  victory.  At  the 
second  battle  of  Quebec,  which  took  place  near  St.  Foy,  and  where  he  had  gathered 
the  remnant  of  the  French  army  with  the  ostensible  purpose  of  wresting  Quebec 
from  Murray's  hands,  he  commanded,  and  achieved  a  victory  over  Murray  ;  but  this 
so-called  victory  was  not  so  complete  as  to  i)revent  the  latter  from  holding  the 
city.  De  Levis,  elated  by  his  success,  still  ki:\)t  near  Quebec  until  sprirg,  when,  on 
reinforcements  arriving  from  F^ngland,  he  had  to  beat  a  hasty  retreat  to  Montreal ; 
and  even  there  he  would  have  held  out  aganist  the  F'.nglish  until  the  very  last,  had 
not  De  Vaudreuil  wisely  capitulated.  He  returned  to  France  and  again  sought  active 
service.  In  1762  we  find  him  at  the  battle  of  Johannisbourg,  where  the  Prince  of 
Cond6  obtained  a  signal  victory  over  the  forces  of  Prince  Ferdinand.  In  1783,  the 
Government  of  Artois,  as  a  reward  for  his  services,  created  him  a  French  Marshal, 
and  in  the  next  year,  a  Duke  and  Peer  of  France.  He  died  in  1787,  whilst  endeavor- 
ing to  uphold  the  State  of  Arras." 

HISHOP   PLESSIS. 

"Joseph  Octave. Plessis  was  the  greatest  man  who  ever  occupied  the  Roman 
Catholic  Episcopal  seat  at  Quebec  since  Francois  de  Laval  Montmorency.  M. 
Plessis  was  the  first  Canadian  Bishop  who  ever  visited  Rome,  and  the  first  ever 
appointed  by  the  Crown  to  be  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Council.  He  was  born 
at  Montreal,  3rd  March,  1762.  He  was  ordained  a  priest  at  Quebec  nth  March, 
1786.  From  time  to  time,  he  was  employed  as  Professor  of  Humanity,  at  the  Col- 
lege of  St.  Raphael,  also  as  Secretary  to  the  Bishop  of  Quebec  and  Curate  of  the 
Capital.  On  the  6th  September,  1797,  he  was  created  Coadjutor  to  Bishop  Denault,

in  iiis  relations  with  certain  rulers.  'J'he  I'litish  ( iovcMiimem  hesitated  to  place  in 
him  that  contidence  which  he  afterwards  accpiired.  I'luler  I'revosl,  Plessis  began  to 
reap  the  fruits  of  his  services,  and  triumphed,  at  least  jiartially,  in  the  opposition 
raised  against  the  provincial  ordinance  of  1791,  since  Sir  dcorge  I'revosl  acknowl- 
edged his  title  of  Roman  Catholic  Hishop  of  Quebec.  lb-  was  called  by  the  Crown 
to  the  Legislative  (!ouncil  in  iSiS,  and  in  this  honnrable  position  he  proved  him- 
self to  be  a  loyal  and  patriotic  Senator.  In  i8ji,  when  the  majority  of  the  Legisla- 
tive Council  resolved  not  to  concur  in  any  bill  from  the  Lower  House,  relative  to  the 
Civil  List,  111  which  special  items  would  be  contained,  this  prelate,  as  well  as  Judge 
Olivier  rerrault,  dissented  therefrom,  and  declared  that  thi.  said  resolution  was  pre- 
mature, too  general,  and  did  not  contain  a  precise  specification  of  the  objects  com- 
prised under  the  head  of  the  Civil  List.  This  indefatigable  Bishop  meditated  the 
erection  of  all  the  l-inglish  Colonies  into  one  ecclesiastical  province,  of  which  Quebec 
should  be  the  metropolis.  He  left  for  Hngland  and  Rome  in  1819.  In  considera- 
tion of  eminent  services  wliich  he  had  rendered  to  Liigland,  during  the  I'rench 
Revolution,  and  during  the  War  of  1812,  as  J.egislative  Councillor,  he  met  with  a 
kind  and  hearty  recei)tion  from  Lord  lialhurst,  with  whom  he  had  several  interviews, 
and  was  his  guest  at  his  country  seat.  Although  he  could  not  obtain  his  consent  to 
the  appointment  of  an  archbishop  at  ()uebec,  nor  to  that  of  bishops  for  Montreal 
and  Kingston,  he  was  allowed  district  bishops  at  Kingston,  Red  River,  and  in  the 
Lower  Province ;  their  bulls  not  only  denominated  them  au.xiliaries,  but  suffragans 
to  the  iJishap  of  Quebec,  and  they  were  thus  assimilated  to  other  metropolitan 
bishops  of  the  first  centuries  of  the  Church,  before  the  title  of  archbishop  was  known. 
With  respect  to  Nova  Scotia,  the  Sovereign  Pontiff  had  placed  there  a  vicar-apostolic. 
It  was  Monseigneur  Edmund  lUirke,  e.\-grand  vicaire  to  Plessis,  who  consecrated  him 
in  1818,  prior  to  his  departure  for  Europe.  He  returned  to  Quebec  on  the  16th 
August,  1820,  and  was  received  with  great  demonstrations  of  respect  and  affection 
by  the  inhabitants  of  Quebec.  FK  was  accompanied  by  the  Abbe  Lartigue,  named 
suffragan  and  au.xiliary  for  the  district  of  Montreal,  where  Monseigneur  Hubert  had 
already  tried  to  have  an  E]&gt;iscopal  See  erected.  He  consecrated  him  in  the  ancient 
Parochial  Church  in  1821.  The  mandate  of  installation,  issued  by  Monseigneur 
Plessis,  accorded  to  the  suffragan's  auxiliaries  the  same  honors  as  to  himself.  He 
died  at  the  General  Hospital  in  Quebec,  on  the  4th  December,  r825,  aged  sixty-two

LORD  MOUNT  STEI'IIliN. 

(Ieoroe,  Loud  Mount  Stephen,  forinr.ily  Sir  (ieorge  Stcplieii,  was  born  at  iHiffiown,. 
lianff.  Scolland,  5th  June,  1829.  He  conimeiiccd  liis  business  life  in  the  town  of 
Aberdeen.  Afterwards  lie  went  to  liOndon.  where  his  business  education  was  com- 
pleted. In  iS;,o,  at  twenty-one  years  of  age,  he  came  to  Canada,  where,  in  Montreal,, 
he  entered  into  arrangements  with  his  cousin,  the  late  William  Stephen.  After  three 
years,  he  was  given  a  partnership  in  the  business.  The  elder  Mr.  Stephen  dying  in 
1862,  the  subj;;ci  of  tliis  sketch  purchased  his  cousin's  interest  in  the  t)i'siness,  and 
began  on  a  large  scale  the  manufacture  of  cloth.  Proving  highly  lucnitive,  lie  with- 
drew from  the  wholesale  busmess  and  devoted  himself  entirely  to  manufacturing. 
He  was  elected  a  Director  of  the  H.ink  of  .Montreal,  and  in  1876  was  made  Vice- 
President.  When  David  Torrance  died,  he  was  made  President.  At  this  lime  he 
give  m  :ch  attention  to  ceitain  railways  in  the  Far  West,  and  which  led  to  his  con- 
ne&lt;tio;i  with  the  formalion  and  development  of  the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway.  In 
i88i,  he  was  elected  its  Piesident,  and  he  richly  deserved  that,  ,n  1885,  the  Govern- 
ment of  Canada  gave  him  the  Confederation  medal.  Ne.xt  year,  1886,  Her  Majesty 
the  Qiicen,  also  to  recogni/e  his  energy  and  great  services  in  this  wonderful  under- 
taking, created  him  a  Baronet.  In  1885,  with  Sir  Donald  Smith,  he  founded  what  is 
called  "  The  Montreal  Scliolarship."  It  is  tenable  for  three  years  and  open  to  all 
residents  of  Montreal  and  its  vicinity,  and  gives  the  recipient  a  ihree  years'  course  in 
tlie  R)yal  ('oUege  of  Music,  London.  But  the  best  as  well  as  the  largest  of  all  his 
munificent  gifts  was  that,  also  in  conjunction  with  Sir  Donald  Smith,  who  is  ever  first 
in  every  good  cause,  of  the  princely  gift  of  $1,000,000,  or  $500,000  each,  to  build  a 
new  hospital,  to  be  called  '' T!ie  Victoria  Hospital,"  in  commemoration  of  the 
Jubilee  of  Her  Most  Giacious  Majesty  the  Queen. 

In  commemoration  of  this  munificent  gift,  the  Queen  rai.sed  him,  in  1889,  to  the 
high  rank  of  a  Peer  of  the  Realm  of  Great  Britain,  and  under  the  title  of  Lord 
Mount  Stephen,  which  is  the  highest  mountain  of  the  Rockies,  acknowledged  his 
worth  and  generosity  towards  the  citizens  of  Montreal  in  particular,  and  all  Canada 
in  general.  He  married  when  quite  a  young  man,  but  having  no  children,  Lady 
Mount  Stephen,  some  years  ago,  adopted  a  Montreal  little  girl  as  her  own  daughter  :i 
she  is  now  married  to  a  son  of  the  well-known  English  politician,  Sir  Stafford 
Northcote.  and.  as  Lady  Northcote,  resides  in  England.  His  Lordship  resides  part 
of  the  year  in  England  and  part  in  Montreal.  The  reasons  of  the  Author  why  the 
dedication  of  this  book  is  given  to  Lord  Mount  Stephen  show  the  principal  events- 
of  his  public  life,  and  why  these  honors  have  been  showered  on  him.  He  is  not  an 
old  man  by  any  means,  but  still  energetic  and  active,  and  let  us  hope  has  many  years 
of  usefulness  and  ease  still  in  store  for  him  and  his  most  estimable  lady. 

Since  the  above  short  sketch  of  Lord  Mount  Stephen  has  been  written,  he  has  lost 
his  father.  A  few  weeks  ago,  and  in  Montreal,  the  old  gentleman  died,  full  of  years 
and  peace,  at  the  advanced  age  of  ninety-one.    Little  did  the  father  think,  more  thai&gt;

world — a  Pear  of  that  Realm  on  which  the  sun  never  sets.     But  truth  every  day  is 

stranger  than  fiction,  and  it  all  points  to  the  fact  that  what  has  been  done  in  the

Montreal  at  the  present  day  who  in  the  coming  twentieth  century  will  also  make 

his  mark  (like  the  subject  of  this  sketch)  among  the  nations  of  the  earth,  and  his

"This  most  estimable  and  learned  divine,  J.  J.  Lartigue,  was  born  at  Montreal,  on 
the  20th  of  June,  1777.  He  was  named  by  Pope  Pius  VII.,  on  the  ist  February, 
1820,  Bishop  of  Felmessa  in  Lycia,  and  suffragan  bishop  to  the  Bishop  of  Quebec 
for  the  district  of  Montreal.  He  was  consecrated  in  the  Parochial  Church  of  Mont- 
real, by  His  Grace  Bishop  Plessis,  on  the  21st  January,  iSar.  He  labored  hard 
during  1837-8  to  allay  the  agitated  feelings  of  hi.s  people,  and  was  most  useful  during 
that  troublous  time.     He  died  on  the  i6th  April,  1840,"

David  Torrance,  of  Quebec.  Removing  to  Montreal  he  joined  Harrison  Stephens 
in  business.  No  man  was  more  imbued  with  a  lovc  for  developing  Montreal  than 
John  Young.  In  1851,  he  was  chosen  Commissioner  of  Public  Works,  in  the 
Hincks-Morin  Cabinet,  and  retired  Irom  ill-health  in  1857.  In  1872,  he  was  elected 
for  Montreal  West,  for  the  House  of  Commons.  In  two  years  he  gave  up  political 
life  and  devoted  himself  to  the  interests  of  Montreal.  He  was  President  of  the  Board 
of  Trade,  for  years  one  of  the  Harbor  Commissioners,  and  after  doing  as  much 
as  any  man  had  ever  done  for  develo])ing  the  growth  of  his  adopted  city,  he  died  on 
the  1 2th  April,  1878,  universally  mourned  by  all  classes  of  the  community  and  city

SIR  DONALD  A.  SMITH. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch,  remarkable  for  his  generosity  and  gifts  to  Montreal,  was 
born  in  Morayshire,  Scotland,  1821.  He  came  to  Canada  when  quite  a  youth. 
There  is  no  living  man  so  identified  with  the  Northwest  Territories  of  Canada  and 
the  Hudson  Buy  Company  as  Sir  Donald  Smith.  E;irly  in  life  he  entered  the  employ 
of  the  Hudson  Bay  Company,  and  rose  gradually  from  post  tu  post  til'  he  became 
a  Director  and  afterwards  i'rcsident.  Governor  and  Chief  Commissioner  of  that  vast 
concern.  In  1S70,  he  was  appointed  an  Executive  Councillor  of  the  Northwest 
Territories  and  one  of  the  Commissioners  to  incjuire  into  the  reasons  of  the  insur- 
rection of  18^19-70.  He  has  had  an  active  life,  and  has  been  connected  with  the 
Mitchell  Steamship  Company,  the  Bank  of  Montreal,  of  which  he  is  now  the 
esteemed  President,  and  the  Railway  Equi[)mcnt  and  Stock  Comjjany.  He  repre- 
sented Winnipeg  from  187 1  to  1874  in  tlie  Manitoba  Assembly,  wiien  he  resigned,, 
in  order  to  confine  his  attention  to  the  House  of  Commons.  He  was  returned  for 
Manitoba  on  its  admission  into  the  Union  in  187  i,  re-elected  in  1874,  and  again  in 
1878.  At  present  he  is  the  worthy  member  for  Montreal  West  in  the  House  of  Com- 
mons of  Canada, 

Sir  Donald  Smith  was  the  last  resident  Governor  of  the  Hudson  Bay  Company, 
and  has  been  greatly  connected  with  the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway  from  its  com- 
mencement. When  the  last  spike  of  that  celeb'  xted  railway  was  driven  in  on  the  7th 
November,  1885,  at  Craigallachie,  B.C.,  Sir  Donald  Smith  was  present.  His  house 
in  Montreal  is  one  of  the  finest  private  residences  in  the  city.  His  munificent  gifts 
to  McGill  College  are  still  fresh  in  the  public  mind,  and  especially  that  of  the 
"  Donalda  College  "  for  women,  entirely  purchased  and  equipped  by  him.  He  is 
justly  a  Governor  of  McGill,  which  he  has  so  much  benefitted.  The  crowning  act 
of  Sir  Donald's  is  in  conjunction  with  Lord  Mount  Stephen  of  their  princely  gift  for 
building  and  endowing  the  "Victoria  Jubilee  Hospital." 

Perhaps,  among  all  the  thousands  of  the  gifts  to  Her  Majesty  on  her  auspicious 
Jubilee,  none  were  so  costly  or  princely  as  that  one  of  Lord  Mount  Stephen  and  Sir 
Donald  Smith.  The  writer,  when  looking  at  the  vast  variety  of  these  gifts  exhibi.eu 
from  every  land  and  shore  in  the  Glasgow  Exposition  of  1888,  could  not  but  feel 
proud  of  his  adopted  country,  Canada,  and  a  wave  of  national  pride  passed  through 
his  bosom  when  he  looked  upon  the  hand-made  socks  and  mitts  and  the  scarfs  and 
mufilers  knitted  by  old  palzied  hands  of  ''Scottish  birth  and  Scottish  name"  among 
those  gifts,  and  then  thought  of  the  grand  Christian  cosmopolitan  one  of  the  "Jubilee 
Hospital  of  Montreal." 

"Show  me  thy  faith  by  thy  works."  Christ  went  about  ever  doing  good.  All 
manner  of  disease  He  cured,  and  the  man  or  men  who  devote  their  energy  and 
means  to  do  the  same,  receive  a  better  testimony  than  they  who  give  their  all  to 
advance  their  family  and  name.  The  great  command  of  the  Christian  religion  is 
— "  to  love  thy  neighbor  as  thyself."  All  praise,  then,  to  the  two  citizens  of  Montreal 
who  have  so  grandly  exemplified  these  words  of  the  Evangel.

Upon  the  whole,  the  career  of  Sir  Donald  Smith  has  been  marked  by  individual 
generosity  and  public  gratitude,  by  fine  abilities  and  the  highest  sense  of  public  in- 
tegrity and  honor.  May  he  live  long  to  dispense  his  gratitude  and  benevolence,  and 
to  him  may  tlie  declaration  at  last  be  applied,  "  Well  done," 

SIR  JAMES  CUAIG,  K.CB., 

Was  born  at  Gibraltar  in  1750,  where  his  father  was  botii  civil  and  military  judge- 
He  chose  the  military  profession,  and,  after  an  eventful  career,  was  sent  out  to  Quebec 
as  (jovernor-in-Chief  of  British  America.  A  disease,  which  was  incurable,  rendered  - 
him  imable  to  continue  longer  his  command,  so  he  retired  and  left  (Canada,  19th 
June,  181 1.  His  name  is  perpetuated  in  Craig  street,  Montreal.  He  died  January, 
1.S12. 

Christie,  in  his  History  of  Canada,  thus  describes  him  :  — 

"  He  was  of  an  agreeable  countenance,  and  impressive  ])resence,  stout  and  rather 
below  the  middle  stature  ;  manly  and  dignified  in  deportment,  but  social,  polite  and 
affable;  positive  in  his  opinions,  and  decisive  in  his  measures.  Although  hasty  in 
temper,  he  was,  like  most  men  who  are  so,  far  from  implacable  ;  and,  as  we  have  seen, 
easily  reconciled  to  those  who  may  have  incurred  his  displeasure.  Hospitable  and 
princely  in  his  style  of  living,  he  was  also  munificent  in  his  donations  to  public  insti- 
tutions :  and  to  charitable  purposes,  a  generous  patron  ;  and  lastly,  we  vMaW  mention, 
though  not  the  least  of  his  virtues,  a  friend  to  the  poor  and  destitute,  none  of  whom, 
applying  at  his  threshold,  ever  went  away  unrelieved." 

CniEF-JUSTTCE  SIR  J.  STUART,  Bart.,  LL.D. 

"  Sir  James  Stuart  was  the  third  son  of  Dr.  John  Stuart,  a  Clergyman  of  the  Church 
of  England  at  Fort  Hunter,  and  afterwards  Rector  of  Kingston.  Sir  James  was  born 
at  Fort  Hunter,  on  the  Mohawk  River,  State  of  New  York,  on  the  2nd  of  March, 
1780.  He  went  to  the  College  at  Windsor,  in  Nova  Scotia,  then  the  only  Protestant 
collegiate  institution  in  British  North  America.  Having  completed  the  ordinary 
course  of  study  in  that  College  at  the  unusually  early  age  of  fourteen,  he  became, 
in  1749,  a  student-at-law  with  Mr.  Reid,  then  Prothonotary  of  the  Court  of  King's 
Bench  at  Montreal,  with  whom  he  remained  four  years.  In  1798,  he  entered  the 
office  of  the  late  Jonathan  Sewell,  then  Attorney-General,  and  afterwards  Chief-Justice 
of  Lower  Canada,  and  was  called  to  the  Bar  28th  of  March,  1801.  Before  being 
called,  however,  he  received  |from  Sir  Robert  Shore  Milnes,  Lieutenant-Governor  of 
Lower  Canada,  the  appointment  of  assistant-secretary,  which  he  retained  for  several 
years,  practising  at  the  same  time  his  profession  at  Quebec. 

In  1805,  at  the  early  age  of  twenty-five,  he  was  appointed  Solicitor-General  for 
Lower  Canada,  and  removed  to  Montreal,  which  was  the  usual  station  of  the  Incum- 
bent of  that  office.

suspended  from  office  by  Lord  Aylmer,  the  then  (iovernor-Ceneral,  which  suspension 
the  Colonial  Minisiei  (Lord  Coderich)  thought  it  expedient  to  advise  the  Crown  to

member  of  the  special  Council  of  Lower  Canada,  and  acted  as  Chairman  of  that 
body.  The  incorporation  of  liie  cities  of  (Quebec  and  xMontreal,  and  a  general 
municipal  system  for  Lower  Canada,  are  also  understood  to  l)e  liis  work  :  and  his

Kor  his  eminent  public  services,  he  was  created  a  Baronet  of  the  ITnited  King- 
dom in  1840,  on  which  occasion  he  selected  for  his  motto:  '' Jiistitiu- [&lt;roposiliqu€

1818  to  the  only  surviving  daughter  of  Alexander  Robinson,  Esquire,  of  Montreal, 
and  left  four  children,  three  sons,  the  eldest  of  whom  inherits  the  baronetcy,  and  one

house  of  Burnside  and  all  his  property  and  a  sum  of  ;^io,ooo  to  found  the  College

lence of  his  actions  toward  the  families  of  the  political  offenders  in  1837--1838.  He 
also  was  amongst  the  number  who  were  incarcerated  at  that  unliappy  period. 
After  his  release  he  devoted  himself  entirely  to  the  families  of  his  co-patriots  then

Bishop.  It  was  decided  at  the  election  of  Bishop  Bond,  or  just  I'cfore  it,  that  the 
office  of  Metropolitan  should  be  no  longer  stationary  in  Montreal  Diocese,  but  that 
the  longest  consecrated  Bishoj)  should  always  be  the  Metropolitan,  and  Montreal 
continue  to  be  the  seal  of  the  Provincial  Synod,  which  meets  every  three  years,  and 
includes  all  the  Provinces  of  the  Dominion  east  of  Manilol)a.  ^ 

The  Bishop  received  the  degree  of  M.A.  from  Bishop's  College,  Lennoxville,  and 
LL.D.  from  McGill  University,  in  1877.

He  has  ahvnys  been  n  great  friend  of  education,  and  was  a  member  for  some 
time  of  llie  Council  of  I'ubh'c  Instruction  for  the  Province  of  Quebec. 

He  was  instrumental,  with  the  first  Metropolitan,  in  getting  the  Normal  School 
(I'rotestant)  opened  in  this  city.  .'Xt  the  jubilee  of  Iiis  ministry  last  year,  a  con- 
siderable sum  of  money  was  jtresciued  to  the  IJishop,  with  the  best  wishes  of  his  many 
friends  and  admirers.  He  is  still  able  to  travel  through  his  extensive  diocese,  and 
annually  visits  every  Church  and  Parish  within  its  bounds.  He  has  ruled  the  affairs 
of  the  Diocese  most  successfully,  and  has  been  at  all  times,  to  his  Clergy  and  the 
Laity  of  every  Parish,  not  only  their  spiritual  father,  but  their  friend. 

His  sons  are  well  known  in  IMontreal.  Col.  Frank  Pond  for  many  years  was 
the  genial  Commander  of  "  1'he  l^rincc  of  Wales  Rifles  Regiment,"  and  his  other 
son,  luhvard — (;nce  Major  in  the  same  corps — is  now  an  extensive  Marine  Insurance 
agent  in  Montreal.  He  is  a  successful  worker  in  the  Temperance  cause  and  Equal 
Rights,  and  on  the  floor  of  the  Synod  is  ever  ready  to  ujjhold  whatever  is  beneficial 
to  the  Diocese,  and  likely  to  promote  iih  welfare.  He  is  very  useful  in  the  Societies 
for  "  The  Protection  of  Women  and  Children,"  and  that  of  "Cruelty  to  Animals." 
The  two  brothers  are  true  Montrealers — boll;  having  been  born  in  this  city,  and 
educated  in  the  High  School  and  McCill  University. 

SIR  GEORGE  CARTIER,  Bart. 

CiKoRp,!.;  Ktiexne  Cartter  was  born  at  St.  Antoine,  on  the  Hanks  of  the  Chambly 
River,  on  the  6ih  September.  1814,  His  grandfather  was  one  of  the  first  represen- 
tatives of  his  native  County  of  Vercheres.  In  1791,  the  present  name  of  Vercheres 
was  not  known,  the  county  was  called  Surrey.  Sir  George  was  educated  at  St.  Sulpice 
College,  Montreal,  afterward  studied  Law,  and  in  1835  was  admitted  to  the  Par  of 
Lower  Canada.  The  year  after  broke  out  the  rebellion  of  1837-38.  It  is  needless 
here  to  say  that  the  French  (Canadians  almost  to  a  nian  supported  Papineau,  their 
leader,  and  that  the  family  compact  had  much  to  do  with  the  uprising.  Cartier 
was  one  of  those,  and,  as  a  price  was  set  upon  his  head,  he  escaped  to  the  United 
States.  At  the  close  of  hostilities  he  returned  to  Canada  a  sadder  and  a  wiser  man. 
Pai^ineau  found  him  a  "  mastering  rival."  He  was  first  elected  for  Vercheres  in 
184S,  and  continued  to  t86i  to  represent  the  county,  till  he  defeated  Mr.  Dorion, 
whom  a  writer  styles  ''  Tiie  Goliath  of  the  Rouges  in  Montreal,"  and  became  the 
member  for  the  East  District  of  the  city.  Previously,  in  1S56,  he  was  Provincial 
Secretary  in  the  McNab-Tache  Administration,  and  the  same  year  succeeded  Mr. 
Drummoiul,  Attorney  General  for  Lower  Canada.  In  August,  1858,  he  became  one 
of  the  Cartier-McDonald  Administrati(jn.  He  was  instrumental  in  getting  passed 
many  prominent  Acts  for  the  better  arlministration  of  the  affiiirs  of  the  Dominion. 
Her  Majesty,  shortly  after  Confederation,  created  him  a  Baronet.  He  had  mu('h  to 
do  in  the  project  of  the  C.  P.  Railway,  etc.  Elections  took  place  in  1872,  and  Sir 
George    was   utterly  overwhelmed   by   Mr.    Jette,     now  Hon.   Justice  Jette.     This

broke  his  heart.  He  retired  to  England,  and  shortly  after  died.  His  funeral  was 
one  of  the  grandest  ever  .seen  in  Montreal.  It  was  a  public  testimony  to  his  great 
worth.     ],ady  Cartier  and  daughter  still  live  abroad. 

SIR  L.  H.  LAFONTAINt:,  Hart. 

Oi''  the  history  of  this  celebrated-  man  we  cannot  say  a  great  deal,  as  the  space  at 
our  command  is  very  meagre.  He  is  the  descendant  of  Antoine  Menard  Lafonlaiiie, 
Esq..  who  was  a  member  of  the  Parliament  of  I,o\ver  Canada  from  1796  to  1804. 
Sir  Louis  Hypolite  was  born  at  Boucherville,  Canada  East,  in  October,  1807  ;  he  is 
the  third  son  of  A.  M.  Lafontaine  (son  of  the  former),  and  of  Marie  J.  Fontaine 
Hienvenu.  his  wife. 

For  tlie  sketch  of  his  career,  we  are  indebted  to  the  clever  writer  of  tlie  "  Jl^ds/i- 
ingtoii  Sketches,''  written  at  the  time  that  the  ("hief-Juslice  was  at  the  zenith  of  his 
jiolitical  life  : — 

'■  For  many  years  M.  Lafontaine  apjjlied  himself  to  the  \\x\  with  great  diligence 
and  success.  He  accumulated  a  handsome  fortune  and  made  an  advantageous 
match.  It  was  not  until  he  thought  himself  "  rich  enough  "  that  he  gave  much 
attention  to  politics. 

"  At  first  he  was  follower,  then  a  rival,  of  I'apineau.  Tlie  latter  was  wiUi  the 
parti pretre,  the  former  led  that  of  La  jetiiie  France,  and  the  i)riests  shook  their 
heads  at  his  ortliodoxy  ;  in  fact,  sj)oke  of  him  as  little  better  than  an  intidel.  But 
"circumstances  alter  cases."  Botii  fled,  in  1837,  f''^'"!  warrants  for  high  treason, 
M.  T.afonlaine  reached  J^ngland,  where,  not  feeling  himself  safe,  by  the  assistance  of 
Mr.  Edward  Ellice,  who  had  the  greatest  single  property  in  Canada,  he  escaped 
across  the  channel  to  France. 

"  More  fortunate  than  M.  Papineau,  he  v/as  very  soon  enabled  to  return,  there 
in  reality  being  no  evidence  against  him. 

"  In  1843,  M.  I,afontaine,  who,  after  the  deatli  of  Lord  Sydenhnm,  had  worked 
himself  into  place  as  the  h.ead  of  the  Frencii  party,  quarrelled  with  i,ord  Metcalfe,  in 
whom  he  met  a  man  resolute  as  himself.  The  issue  was  taken  on  a  general  election. 
The  Tory  party  was  then  in  the  ascendency  in  Upper  Canada,  and,  united  with  the 
Moderates,  out  of  forty-two  representatives,  returned  all  but  nine,  aid  of  these  three 
doubtful.  M.  Lafontaine  brought  up  his  wing  of  the  brigade  gallandy  ;  i)Ut  it  was  of 
no  use  ;  the  centre  and  the  other  wing  were  routed.  He  was  doomed  for  three  years 
to  the  ''  cold  shade  of  opposition,"  in  which  he  showed  great  constancy  and 
industry. 

"  In  March,  1848,  the  Tory  party  fell.  Their  o])ponents  in  Upper  Canada 
gained  twenty  seats,  saved  all  the  French  counties,  and  gained  Montieal  and  three 
English  or  mixed  counties,  giving  them  a  m.-jority  of  two-thirds  of  the  House.  M, 
Lafontaine  then  resumed  his  old  pl:ice,  and  became  the  virtual  premier. 

"  M.  Lafontaine  was  not  an  eloquent  speaker,  his  utterance  being  thick  and 
guttm-al,  and  his  English,  though  good   in  structure,  bad  in  pronunciation.      In  fact 


122  GAZKTTKKR  OK  MONTREAL. 

he  rarely  tried  the  latter.  But  he  was  a  close  and  compact  logician,  and  never  lost 
his  temper. 

"  M .  Lafontainc  had  a  handsome  countenance,  of  a  style  which  much  resembled 
that  of  Najjoleon,  and  a  magnihcent  forehead." 

Sir  l/niis  remained  in  otfice  until  October.  1851,  wlien  the  Hincks-Tache  Admin- 
istration was  formed.  On  the  13th  August,  1S53,  he  was  elevated  to  the  Chief- 
justiceship  of  the  Court  of  Queen's  Bench  of  I.jwcr  Canada,  and  on  the  28lli  August, 
1854,  was  created,  for  liis  eminent  services,  a  Baronet  of  the  United  Kingdom. 

.Sir  Louis  married  twice,  but  had  no  issue  ;  first  in  1S31,  to  Adele.  only 
daughter  of  A.  Berthelot,  I'.stiuire,  advocate,  and  secondly,  in  i860,  to  a  widow  lady 
of  Montreal.     He  died  a  few  years  ago.

career  and  graduated  B.C'.L.  At'terwards  he  studied  Law,  and  in  1847  was  called  to 
the  Bar  of  Lower  Canada.  He  has  always  been  a  standard  authority  on  Commer- 
cial l-a\v.  It  was  in  1859  he  first  entered  politics,  being  the  representative  of 
his  native  county  in  the  old  Canadian  Assembly  till  the  I'nion,  when  he  was 
returned  to  the  House  of  Commons.  From  1874  to  1880  he  retired  from  [)ublic 
life,  but  again  represented  Argenteuil.  His  gieat  work  was  the  Insolvent  Act  of 
1864.  For  a  short  lime  in  1862  Mr.  Abbott  lield  the  appointment  of  Solicitor- 
Cleneral  in  the  Sandfield  Macdonald-Sicotte  Administration.  Some  time  before 
this  he  had  been  made  a  Q.C.  He  is  the  author  of  several  important  public 
measures.  For  some  years  he  has  been  a  Senator.  On  the  death  of  the  late  Sir  John 
A.  Macdonald,  he  was  called  to  form  a  new  Cabinet,  and  now  holds  the  high  position 
of  Premier  of  Canada,  His  wife  is  a  daughter  of  the  first  Dean  of  Montreal  —  May,

C.  J.  C.OURSOL,  Q.C, 

Was  born  in  (Jntario.  1S20,  being  the  son  of  an  officer  of  the  Hudson  Bay  Company. 
He  was  called  to  the  Bar  of  J,ower  Canada  in  1841.  In  the  Trent  affair  he  raised 
the  Regiment  of  the  "Chasseurs  Canadiens,"  and  during  the  Fenian  excitement 
Judge  Coursol  was  with  his  Regiment  on  the  Borders  of  Canada.  Afterwards  he 
was  appointed  Judge  of  Quarter  Sessions  and  Police  Commissioner.  He  is  well 
known  in  connection  with  the  St.  Alban's  Raiders,  and  his  decision  thereon  was 
endorsed  by  l^ord  Cairns.  He  was  connected  with  the  reception  of  the  Pontifical 
Zouave  movement  and  was  elected  Mayor  of  Montreal  in  187 1.  He  was  also 
Director  of  various  public  Institutions,  and  died  some  years  ago  universally  regretted.

CHIKE'   Jrsi  li,'lf.,    SriKKK'K    (   OLRl. 

Thk  siihjcct  of  this  skclcii  was  \)()T\\  at  Oakcy  House,  Bedfordshire,  England,  on 
New  Year's  ilay,  1S17.  His  father  was  (lodschall  Joliiis  jn,  an  officer  of  tlie  loth 
Royal  Hu//.ars.  This  Reginicnl  was  then  known  as  the  Trineo  of  Wales  Regiment. 
His  mother,  Lucy  Bishop,  came  of  an  historical  family.  Slie  was  a  daughter  of  Sir 
Cecil  l&gt;ishop,  and  sister  to  Col.  Cecil  Jti^hop,  who  fell  in  the  War  of  1S12-1  [.  and 
was  buried  at  NMagara,  where  a  fme  monument,  v. sited  h)  many  tourists,  is  still  to  lie 
seen.  Our  subject  was  cdui  ated  at  St.  Dmer.  Irance,  hence  Sir  Francis'  thorough 
knowledge  of  the  French  language  and  Parisian  :m  cent.  Afterwards  he  went  to  a 
large  educational  establishment  at  iiiuges,  I'.elgium.  In  1835,  he  came  to  Canada 
and  studied  Law  with  the  late  Hon.  Justice  Day,  was  called  to  the  Bar  m  i.S.to,  prac- 
tised in  Montreal,  and  created  a  (,).C.  m  1.S46  ;  a  rapid  career  for  one  ueit  thirty 
years  of  age.  It  was  whilst  Crown-Lroso*  utor  that  the  abihty  of  the  lawyer  was 
shown.      His  eloquence  was  so  noted  that  he  had  few  compeers  ai  the  Bar 

So  thoroughly  versed  in  legal  lore  was  Sir  1  rancis  at  tliis  time  that  he  hekl  one 
or  two  civil  ai)]ointments.     One  was  the  Secretary   of  the  Commission  to  revise  the 
Statutes  of  Lower  Canada  ;  another,  the  Recorder  of  Ru[)ert's  Land.     The  third  was 
J     the  most  important,  being  the  jxisition  of  Governor  of  Assiniboine,  Manitoba,  which 
he  held  for  four  years,  and  returned  to  Montreal  in  185S. 

He  resumed  his  practice  in  the  city  foi  seven  years  after  his  return,  till  June, 
1865,  when  he  was  api)ointed  a  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court,  rising  gradually  on  the 
Bench  till  he  is  now  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  Superior  Court  for  the  large  and  most 
important  District  of  Montreal. 

in  the  year  1870,  Judge  Johnson  was  deputed  by  the  Dominion  Government  to 
act  as  S])ecial  Commissioner  to  ^L'lnitoba,  and  to  report  on  and  organize  the  ('ourts 
of  that  new  Liovince. 

He  was  also  appointed  the  sole  Commissioner  to  settle  the  Rebellion  Losses 
claims  after  the  first  Riel  uprising.  He  returned  to  Montreal  in  1872,  and  was  offered 
the  (Governorship  of  the  Province  he  had  labored  so  much  to  bring  into  legal 
existence,  but  as  this  would  necessitate  the  resignation  of  his  being  Judge,  he  ])re- 
ferred  his  profession,  and  remains  in  it  as  one  of  its  most  illustrious  lights. 

Sir  l-'rancis  has  been  twice  married.  His  first  wife  was  Mary  Gates  Jones,  who 
died  in  1853.  She  was  a  daugiiter  of  Mr.  Jones  of  Montreal,  a  partner  in  the  once 
famous  firm  of  Horatio  Gates  iV  Co.,  of  Montreal.  His  second,  whom  he  married  in 
1857.  was  Mary  Mills,  daughter  of  John  M.  Mills,  of  Somersetshire,  England.  He 
has  had  six  children,  and  though  now  in  his  75th  year,  no  man  walks  the  street  so 
upright  and  soldier-like  as  hims&lt;;lf. 

His  long  services  to  his  country  were  recognized  by  the  Queen,  and  on  the  24th 
■     of  May,  1890,  the  Chief  Justice  received  the  distinguished  honor  of  Knighthood,  and 
is  now  known  by  the  name   of  Sir  Francis  Johnson.     May  he  be  long  spared  to  bear 
this  name.

cluded his  studies  at  the  Laval  University,  Quel^cc.  He  was  called  to  the  Bar  of 
Lower  Canada  when  he  had  just  completed  his  majority,  being  twenty-one  years  of 
age  in  TS63,  and  soon  found  himself  with  a  lucrative  and  important  legal  business. 
His  pra(  tice  was  prompt,  he  was  an  able  lawyer  and  he  was  to  be  trusted.  In  1880, 
he  was  made  a(,).C.,  and  called  on  the  4th  March,  1882,  to  the  Legislative  Council 
of  the  Province  of  Quebec  for  the  Division  of  Mille  Isles.  Resigning  the  next  year, 
he  was  appointed  a  Senator  in  1884.  He  was  called  to  the  Speakership  of  the  House  in 
1891.  On  the  death  of  the  late  Chief  Justice,  Sir  A.  A.  Dorion,  from  a  number  of 
names  mentioned  in  the  papers  of  all  kinds,  the  subject  of  our  sketch  was  selected  by 
the  Dominion  Government  to  fill  this  high  and  important  position  on  the  Judiciary 
Bench.  That  he  will  do  so,  he  already  has  shown  his  ability,  and  even  in  this  yet 
short  period  of  his  incumbency  has  inaugurated  certain  reforms,  much  needed,  and 
thus  endorsing  the  Crovernment's  judgment  that  as  Chief  Justice  of  the  Court  of 
Queen's  Bench  he  is  the  right  man  in  the  right  place.

( )l(.l  i'lanci;  and  early  sellled  in  llic  Seigniory  ot  'rerrclionnc.  'I'lic  primary  education 
of  the  lad  was  procured  al  die  Coi!e,ne  of  'IVrrel)onne,  and  thence  lie  went  to  that  of 
St.  Hyiciiuhe,  where  lie  passed  a  brilliant  curricidum.  Having  completed  his 
college  career,  he  entered  for  the  study  of  Law  the  ofFiC(  of  Messrs.  Ouiniet,  .Morin 
&amp;  Maiehand.  When  the  Hun.  i,  S.  Morin  was  &lt;  alK.d  as  Soh'.itor-Oeneral  to  the 
Executive  Council,  Mr.  Cliaple.iu  tl.eii  tirsi  canie  mio  iiolice.  Mis  maiilcu  spcich 
on  the  hustings  was  delivered  at  the  town  of  Terrebonne,  on  the  25111  of  Hecember, 
1859,  anil  his  success  on  that  occasion  made  him  at  once  an  important  factor  in  that 
celebrated  campaign  which  resultt'd  in  the  return  of  ih.e  SolicitDrdcneral.  In  i(S6i, 
he  was  called  to  the  Bar,  and  retained  by  the  new  firm  of  Moreau  \  ()uinKt,  on 
acciiunt  of  his  legal  acumen  in  the  exciting  spheres  of  the  Criminal  Courts.  lli~,  fir.sl 
case  was  the  defence  of  a  whole  family  implicated  in  a  case  of  child  murder.  The 
miserable  condition  of  the  accused,  the  indignation  of  the  people  of  the  ward,  where 
the  crime  had  been  committed,  and  the  weight  of  the  evidence,  had  doomed  tiie 
unfortunate  prisoners  to  certain  condemnation.  'I'lie  young  lawyer  nevertheless  ac- 
cepted that  uneiiual  challenge,  and  .after  superhuman  efforts  saved  the  whole  family 
from  the  gallows.  Since  that  period  more  than  twenty  prisoruus  accused  of  capital 
offences  Jiave,  nearl)  all  successfully,  been  defended  b\  the  learned  Criminalist, 
whose  record  in  the  Court  of  (Queen's  Ijeiich  has  lueii  one  of  the  most  c(jmpkle  in 
the  ranks  of  those  who  have  given  themselves  specially  to  the  practice  of  Criminal 
Law  in  Canada.  In  1873,  he  was  made  a  Queen's  Counsellor,  aiui  in  1882  had  the 
high  honor  of  being  created  "  Commaiuler  of  the  F.egion  of  Honor  of  ]'' ranee."  The 
year  previous  he  had  received  from  Rome  the  distinction  of  having  been  made  a 
*'  Commander  of  the  Order  of  St.  Gregory  the  (ireal." 

However,  politics  had  already  absorbed  a  'arge  portion  of  the  young  lawyer's 
attention  and  studies.  From  i860  to  1867  there  ki  s  not  an  electoral  contest  in  which 
he  did  not  take  a  most  active  jiart.  On  th'e  is,  of  January,  1862,  he  became  the 
joint  proprietor  and  editor  of  "  Le  Co/ou/sa'tur,"  a  tri-weekly  newspaper  which  was 
the  centre  of  action  of  the  young  Conservatr'e  ele.nent  during  the  two  years  of  its 
existence.  At  the  advent  of  Confederation,  he  was  found  fighting  for  the  cause 
of  Confederation.  He  had  during  the  fifteen  months  th.vt  preceded  Confederation, 
successfully  canvassed  the  District  of  Montreal,  where  the  '  Parti  National,"  headed 
by  the  late  M6deric  Lanctot,  was  trying  to  raise  an  anti-British  movement.  He  was 
elected  by  acclamation  member  of  the  Quebec  Legislature  for  Terrebonne  in  1867, 
and  was  returned  without  opposition  in  the  next  (General  Elections  of  1871.  At  the 
opening  of  the  first  Provincial  Parliament  of  Quebec  he  was  intrusted  with  the  task 
of  presenting  the  address  in  answer  to  the  Speech  from  the  Throne.  As  early  as  in 
the  session  of  1868  he  strongly  advocated  the  policy  of  protection   to  Canadian

industries  and  ilie  policy  of  railways,  as  heini;  the  only  moans  of  securing  to  tlu&gt; 
I'ldvuice  the  rank  that  its  geographical  and  coinniercial  situation  in  the  (Confedera- 
tion entitled  it  to  (Kcui)y.  His  speeches  c)n  the  question  of  the  St.  Maurice  and 
(Irandcs  I'iles  .uid  the  Nurth  .Shore  Roads  are  s'ill  m  the  memory  of  the  Members 
(if  tiic  Assembly.  He  deprecated  the  building  of  \vood(.n  railroads,  then  the  hobliy 
of  the  Chauveau-Dunkin  Cabinet,  as  bi-iiig  a  atopy  with  our  rigorous  climate.  With 
the  member  of  Shelford  at  ihe  time,  Mi'.  j&gt;essette,  he  first  l)rought  before  the  House 
the  question  of  Stipendiary  Magistrates,  which  became  an  accomplished  fact  the 
year  after.  His  party  recognized  his  services  in  jjiomoting  him  to  the  Kxecutive 
Council  when  the  Hon.  (1.  ( )uiniet  was  &lt;:alled  to  reconstruct  the  Chauveau  Cabinet 
in  February,  1S73.  He  reieived  then  the  portfolio  of  Solicitor-General  of  the  Pro- 
vince. In  January,  1876,  he  entered  ihe  I  )(.■  lloucherville  (iovcrnmenl  as  Piovincial- 
Secrt'lary  ami  Registrar.  He  held  this  until  the  fracas  of  the  Lelellier  affair  in  1S78, 
wlicn  he  became  tiie  Leader  of  the  Conservative  ( )pi)osiiion.  and  was  mainly  inslru 
mental  in  giving  the  death-blow  to  the  July  Government.  When  it  fell,  the  new 
Lieutenant-Governor,  Hon.  M.  Robitaille,  called  upon  Mr.  Chapleau  to  form  a  new 
Government.  In  this  he  remained  i'remier  ami  Minister  of  Agriculture  and  Public 
Works  and  Minister  of  Railways  till  i,S82,  when  he  was  called  into  the  federal 
Cabinet  as  Secretary  of  State  for  Canada,  in  the  place  of  the  late  Mr.  Mousseau,  who 
succeeded  him  as  Premier  of  (Quebec.  In  July,  1884,  he  was  appointed  a  Commis- 
sioner to  proceed  to  liritish  Columbia  lo  investigate  and  report  upon  China  immi- 
gration into  ('nnada. 

In  the  held  ot  letters  he  has  been  a  frequent  and  brilliant  writer,  but  it  has  always 
been  in  his  oratory  that  he  has  so  far  eclipsed  all  his  contemporaries.  He  is  truly  a  born 
orator,  and  never  made  by  the  precise  rules  of  ihetoric  and  belles-lettres.  Kloqiient, 
fiery  and  fluent,  with  a  clear  musical  utterance,  evejy  syllable  falls  on  the  listener's 
ears  distinct  and  perfect.  As  professor  in  Laval  University,  where  he  occupied  the 
chair  of  Crimiiiai  Law,  it  was  right  he  should  receive  from  that  institution  his  title  ot 
Doctor  of  J.aws,  and  among  all  the  titles  and  affixes  to  his  name,  not  one  is  more 
richly  earned,  nor  does  any  one  sound  better  tlian  this  one  by  which  the  wiiter  desig- 
nates the  subject  of  this  sketch.  May  he  live  long  to  be  an  honor  10  the  LTniversiiy 
from  which  he  derived  it,  not  as  Premier  of  Quebec  nor  as  Secretary  of  State  for  the 
Hominioti  ol  t  anada.  but  as  a  Doctor  of  Laws  from  the  oldest  L'niversily  in  British

Tmk  iianio    of   this    distinguislicd    arid   justly   relebialod   suvdiit    is    not   unknown 

to  most  of  our  readers.      His  labors  in  the  cause  of  Science,  History  ami  Kilucation 

are  calculated  to  give  liiiu  a  high  place  among  (Canadian  literati. 

Sir  William  Dawson  is  a  native  of  I'ictou,  Nova  Scotia,  wlicre  he  was  born  of  a 
good  Scottish  family,  in  October,  1820.  After  com))lci!ng  a  course  of  study  in  C'lassics, 
Mathematics,  Physics,  Mental  Science,  Chemistry,  etc..  in  Pictou  Academy,  taking

on  Mineralogy  and  Cieology.  On  his  return  to  Nova  Scotia,  i!i  1841,  he  travelled 
with  Sir  C.  Lyell,  and,  under  his  dlieclion.  he  explored  and  described,  in  the  ''■Pro- 
ceedings of  the  Geological  Society  of  J.onJon,''  several  points  of  interest  regarding 
the  geology  of  that  jjrovince.  After  having  lectured  on  13ot.in\  and  (leology  in  the 
Academy  of  Pictou,  and  in  the  Dallunisie  College,  and  having  i)ui)lished  several 
educnlional  works,  Mr.  Dawson  was  ap])ointed,  in  1850,  Superintendent  of  Kducalion 
for  Nova  Scotia.  In  1853,  he  resigned  his  office,  and  was  ap[)ointed  one  of  the 
Directors  of  the  new  Normal  School.  Dr.  Dawson  w.is  ai)pc)inled  Principal  of  the 
McGill  Coll(?ge  in  1855,  ^'^^^  '^''■^  subsequently  conferred  on  him  the  honorary  degree 
of  LT..D.  by  the  same  University.  Sir  William  Dawson  is,  moreover,  a  lellow  of 
the  Royal  Geological  Society  of  London,  the  Royal  Society  and  a  Member  of  the 
Natural  History  Society  of  Montreal,  and  of  the  Canadian  Institute.  Toronto,  Cor- 
responding Member  of  the  Academy  of  Natural  Science,  of  Philadelphia,  Fellow  of 
the  American  Academy  of  Arts  and  Science,  and  Honorary  Member  of  the  Botanical 
Society  of  Canada.  He  has  contributed  several  papers  to  the  Pritisli  and  American 
Associations  for  the  promotion  of  the  sciences.  Iksides  the  numerous  essays  juib- 
lished  in  the  Transactions  of  scientific  bodies  or  in  pamphlet  form,  he  has  i)ublished 
the  following  works  :  —  ''  Haiidbool:  of  the  Geogrii[&gt;hy  and  Natural  History 
of  Nova  Scotia,''  "  Mints  to  the  Farmets  of  Nova  Scotia"  "  Acadian  Geology,'" 
"  Archaia."  Besides  these  he  lias  published  a  long  list  of  works — lectures,  jiamphlets 
and  papers  on  almost  every  subject  connected  with  his  favorite  study,  Geology.  Sir 
William  was  awarded  the  Lyell  Medal  of  the  Geological  Society  of  London  for  his 
eminent  discoveries  in  Geology.  He  was  the  first  member  of  the  Royal  Society  of 
Canada.  \\\  recognition  of  his  brilliant  career  and  eminent  qualities  in  Science,  Her 
^Lajesty  honored  him,  in  1881,  with  the  title  of  C.M.G.,  and  in  1884  made  him  a 
Knight.  He  has  travelled  in  Egypt,  Palestine  and  Syria,  and  ])ublished  most  in- 
teresting geological  observations  on  his  tour  through  the  Holy  Land.  In  1884,  1'*^ 
received  the  honorary  degree  of  LL.D  from  the  University  of  Edinburgh.  His  whole 
desire  is  the  promotion  and  advancement  of  McGill  University.  The  writer  well 
remembers  when  he  first  joined  the  College.  It  was  then  the  day  of  small  things,  but 
like  the  mustard  seed  planted  firmly  by  his  governing  hand,  it  has  increased,  till 
the  literary  birds  of  all  denominations  and  nationalities  have  now,  at  the  close  of  the 
nineteenth  century,  come  and  lodged  in  the  branches  of  it.

CAPTAIN  KCJllERTSON. 

Captain  G.  Rouertson  is  a  son  of  the  well-known  Dr.  Robertson  of  Montreal.  He 
joined  the  army  as  late  as  17th  June,  1851.  and  in  Deceniber,  1S59,  had  been  pro- 
moted to  a  captaincy.  He  served  with  the  12th  Regiment,  in  the  Caffre  War  of 
1851-53,  for  which  he  received  the  medal,  and  was  with  the  95th  Regiment  at  the 
siege  and  fall  of  Sebastopol,  from  26th  January,  1855,  f"''  which  he  received  the 
medal  and  clasp,  and  was  honored  with  the  fifth  class  of  the  Medjidie.  He  also 
served  in  1858,  at  the  siege  and  capture  of  Kotah  (medal).  The  Gazette,  in  speak- 
ing of  his  former  services,  said  :  "  Our  citizens  will  join  with  us  in  expressing  our 
hearty  congratulation  on  the  honors  bestowed  upon  him,  which  we  cannot  doubt 
have  been  well  earned  ;  "  and  of  him  and  other  Canadians  "the  whole  country  will 
rejoice  at  these  honors  won  by  Canadians." 

MAJOR  FORSYTH. 

Major  G.  J.  Forsyth  was  a  native  of  Montreal.  "  He  entered  the  military  service  at 
an  early  age,  and  rose  to  the  rank  of  Captain  at  the  age  of  twenty-six,  without  the 
aid  of  those  influences  that  help  others  on.  He  served  through  the  Eastern  Cam- 
paign of  1854-55,  including  the  batdes  of  Balaklava  and  Inkerman,  s'ege  of  Sebas- 
topol, capture  of  the  Quarries,  attack  on  the  Redan,  on  the  18th  June  (with  the 
storming  column),  and  on  the  8th  September,  also  at  Kinbourn,  for  which  he  re- 
ceived the  medal  and  clasps,  the  Sardinian  medal,  and  was  decorated  with  the 
Legion  of  Honor  by  the  F^mperor  of  the  French.  He  retired  with  the  rank  of  Major 
on  the  26th  December,  1856.  His  career  testified  to  the  valor  and  patriotism  of 
the  Canadians,  and  has  been  a  source  of  honor  both  to  himself  and  his  country."

Mr.  Hall  was  l)orn  in  Montreal.  7th  .August,  1S53.  He  w.is  the  son  of  John  S. 
Hall,  sen.,  a  member  of  the  late  well-known  firm  of  (Irant,  Hall  X:  Co.,  extensive 
hnnber  merchants  of  this  city.  Ho  was  educated  at  JJishop's  College  School,  anil  after- 
wards in  Mc(jill  University.  I'' rom  this  latter  institution  he  graduated  15..\.in  1874.  and 
15. C.  I.,  in  1875.  Choosing  Law  as  his  profession,  after  his  curriculum,  he  was  called  to 
the  15ar  of  the  Province  of  (Quebec  in  January,  1X76,  and  appointed  Queen's  Counsel, 
iSS7,on  which  occasion  he  was  heartily  congratulated  by  his  confreres  at  receiving  the 
"silk  '■  so  early  in  his  legal  career.  l)uring  his  incumbency  as  a  (^.C.  he  has  suc- 
cessfully conducted  several  most  important  cases,  and  has  appeared  before  the  Privy 
Council  of  England  on  more  than  one  occasion.  For  some  years  he  has  been  the 
active  partner  of  the  extensive  legal  firm  of  Chapleau,  Hall,  Xicholls  vS:  Brown — 
the  Hon.  J.  A.  Chapleau,  the  .Secretary  of  State  for  Canada,  being  the  senior  i)artner, 
but  taking  no  jiart  in  the  legal  work.  Since  ever  he  was  called  to  the  15ar,  Mr.  Hall 
has  always  taken  a  lively  interest  in  public  affairs.  It  was  reasonable,  therefore,  to 
find  that  he  looked  to  politics  and  the  public  government  of  his  native  i)rovince  as 
the  arena  where  he  could  display  his  talents  and  show  his  administrative  ability. 

At  the  (Jeneral  I'lleclions  in  ICSS7  he  was  returned  for  the  Fifth  Division  of  the 
City  of  Montreal  by  acclamation.  As  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  he  has 
won  the  confidence  of  both  sides.  His  tact  in  debate,  his  industry  in  committee 
work  and  general  straightforwardness  have  given  him  not  only  the  confidence  of  his 
own  colleagues  but  the  respect  of  his  o})ponents.  At  the  dismissal  of  the  Mercier 
Covernment  by  the  Lieutenant-Ciovernor  on  th':  21st  of  last  December,  the  uqw 
Premier  gave  Mr.  Hall  the  important  portfolio  of  Treasurer  of  the  Province,  which 
position  he  now  retains. 

Mr.  Hall  was  elected  a  member  of  the  Corporation  of  McGill  University  in 
1 883  and  re-elected  in  1886.  He  was  also  President  of  the  University  Literary 
Society  in  1880  and  President  of  the  McCiU  Clraduate  Society  in  1884.  He  has  also 
been  President  of  the  Junior  Conservative  Club,  Montreal.

JOHN   RKDrA'lH 

Was  born  at  Jvulston,  Scotland,  in  1796,  and  came  to  Canada  in  1816.  He  became 
one  of  the  most  successful  contractors  in  the  country.  The  Lachine  Canal  is  an 
example  of  his  capabilities  and  work.  When  he  retired  from  business  he  became  con- 
nected with  many  of  Montreal's  institutions.  For  the  long  space  of  thirty-five  years 
he  was  a  Director  of  the  Montreal  Bank  and  became  its  Vice-President.  He  was 
also  connected  with  the  Montreal  Telegraph  Company  and  the  Richelieu  and  Ontario 
Navigation  Company  ;  but  he  is  best  known  as  the  one  who  started  the  first  sugar 
refinery  in  Canada,  a  large  institution  which  still  bears  his  name.  Fie  married  Janet 
Macphie,  glh  December,  181S,  and  had  a  large  family.  His  eldest  Hcn,  Peter,  lives 
in  England,  but  will  ever  be  remembered  in  Montreal  from  the  magnificent  building 
which  he  erected,  and  known  as  the  "  Peter  Redpath  Museum,"  which  he  pre- 
sented to  McCill  College  and  University.  One  of  the  daughters  of  John  Redpath 
married  John  Dougall  of  the  Witness ;  another,  T.  M.  I'aylor,  who  was  one  of  our 
most  efficient  Insurance  Agents,  and  was  well  known  in  all  Christian  good  work.  A 
third  married  Hon.  George  A.  Drunimond.  so  well  known  in  Montreal  asSenatorand 
connected  with  the  Refinery.  A  fourth  married  Professor  IJovey  of  jNIcCill  Uni- 
versity ;  and  the  fifth  married  C.  J.  Fleet,  Advocate,  of  the  firm  of  Messrs.  Robert- 
son, Fleet  &amp;  Co. 

Mr.  John  Redpath  was  for  years  the  Chairman  of  the  General  Hospital  Com- 
mittee and  President  of  the  Mechanics'  Institute.  But  perhaps  the  most  important 
act  of  his  was  his  laying  the  foundation  of  the  Theological  Seminary  of  the  Pies 
byterians,  now  the  "  Presbyterian  College,"  and  which  has  been  so  successful  in 
training  men  for  the  ministry  of  their  church.  He  died  universally  lamented  at  his 
house,  "  Terrace  Bank." 

HON.  JUSTICE  FOUCIIER. 

''Louis  Charles  Foucher  was  born  in  1760,  and  died  26th  December,  1829.  He 
was  admitted  to  the  Bar  in  1784,  and  was  first  returned  to  Parliament  in  1796,  as 
member  for  the  City  of  Montreal.  Some  time  after,  he  was  appointed  Solicitor- 
General,  an  honor  well  merited  by  M.  Foucher,  else  he  could  not  have  attained  it, 
as  in  those  days  it  was  seldom  conferred  upon  a  French  Canadian.  Subsequently 
he  became  resident  Judge  of  Three  Rivers  ;  and,  in  1803,  attained  the  position  whicli 
he  held  at  his  death."

HON.  II.  \V.  RYLANU,  G.  II.  KYLAJ  D  AND  W.  II.  RYLANL). 

H.  W.  RYi.ANDwas  born  in  Norlhamptoii,  England,  in  1770.  He  cnlcicd  the  Public 
service  at  the  early  age  of  twenty-one  as  Assistant  Paymaster-General  in  charge  of 
General  Burgoyne  and  Lord  Cornwallis'  armies  in  the  first  American  War,  in  which 
he  look  part  and  rendered  important  services.  He  accompanied  his  friend  Sir  Guy 
(^arleton  (Lord  Dorchester),  Commander-in-Chief,  to  England. 

In  1793,  when  Lord  iJorchester  was  appointed  to  the  Gove  iment  of  Britisii 
North  America,  Mr.  Ryland  was  induced  by  the  tlien  Prime  Minister,  under  promises 
which  never  were  fulfilled,  to  surrender  a  high  and  lucrative  office  to  accompany  him 
to  Canada  as  Civil  Secretary. 

On  Lord  Dorchester's  return  home  Mr.  Ryland  continued  to  hold  the  same 
office  under  his  immediate  successor  and  several  succeeding  (iovernors. 

Li  the  year  1809  he  was  appointed  by  the  Government  to  proceed  to  England 
on  a  public  mission,  the  ostensible  object  of  wliicli  was  to  endeavor  to  get  the  Ln- 
perial  Government  to  amend  or  suspend  the  Constitution  to  render  the  Government 
independent  of  the  people  by  appropriating  towards  it  all  the  revenues  accruing  from 
the  estates  of  the  St.  Sulpicians  at  Montreal,  and  to  assume  the  patronage  exercised 
by  the  Roman  Catholic  Bishop  of  Quebec  to  the  cures  or  church  livings  in  his 
diocese.  Reluming  to  Canada  no  one  could  ascribe  to  him  the  failure  of  the  Govern- 
ment scheme. 

The  darling  object  of  his  heart  was  doubtless  to  anglicize  the  French  Canadian 
people. 

On  Sir  George  Prevost's  accession  to  tlie  Government,  Mr.  Ryland  gave  up  his 
post  of  Civil  Secretary  and  retained  only  that  of  Clerk  of  the  Executive  Council,  also 
an  important  appointment,  which  he  held  until  his  decease  on  the  aotii  July,  1838, 
at  the  age  of  seventy-eight. 

His  son,  the  late  G.  H.  Ryland,  was  the  Registrar  for  Montreal.  As  a  boy  he 
was  intended  for  the  navy,  but  entered  the  Civil  service  in  1817  as  Secretary  to  the 
Commission  for  the  management  of  the  Jesuits'  Estates.  Li  1821,  he  was  appointed 
Assistant  Clerk  of  the  Council  of  Lower  Canada  and  succeeded  his  father  as  Her 
Majesty's  Clerk  of  the  Council,  which  office  he  afterwards  on  public  grounds  con- 
sented to  surrender,  receiving  under  guaranty  the  Registrarship  of  Quebec,  from 
which  he  was  transferred  to  Montreal.  He  married,  in  1833,  Mary  Pitt,  youngest 
daughter  of  Lieut. -Colonel  Ralph  Gore  and  niece  of  Admiral  Sir  John  Gore.  His 
second  son,  Warwick  Hastings  Ryland,  is  now  the  Registrar  of  Montreal  West.  He 
married  Miss  Kaiilback,  of  Nova  Scotia.

REV.  JOHN  liETIIUNE,  REV.  DEAN  15ETIIUNE,  AND  STRACIIAN  BETIIUNE,  Q.C. 

Perhaps  no  English  family  in  this  city  is  so  long  and  intimately  connected  with  the 
advance  and  growth  of  Montreal  as  the  Belhune  family. 

The  first  mentioned,  the  founder  of  the  family  on  this  Continent,  was  born  in 
the  Island  of  Skye,  Scotland,  in  175 1.  He  was  educated  at  King's  College,  Aber- 
deen, and  emigrated  to  South  Carolina  before  the  War  of  Independence.  Being 
made  a  prisoner  by  the  Americans,  he  so  continued  till  an  exchange  took  place,  when 
he  went  to  Nova  Scotia  and  resided  at  Halifax.  After  the  Peace  he  came  to  Mon- 
treal, not  the  only  U.  E.  Loyalist  who  found  his  way  thither.  He  remained  in  Mon- 
treal till  1787,  when  he  removed  to  Upper  Canada.  One  reason  of  this  removal  was 
his  wish  to  locale  on  the  land  which  as  a  U.  E.  Loyalist  he  had  received  from  the 
Government.  His  grant  was  3,000  acres,  he  ranking  as  a  military  chaplain,  equal  to 
a  captani.  He  took  up  liis  residence  at  Wiiliamstown  and  resimied  his  ministerial 
work  there.  'J'o  sliow  how  zealously  he  worked  during  his  term  of  office  in  that  part 
of  Upper  Canada,  he  baptized  no  less  than  2,379  pt-'i'sons.  He  died  23rd  September, 
1815,  universally  regretted.  Two  of  his  sons  and  the  most  eminent  members  of  his 
family  became  high  dignitaries  in  the  Chur  ch  of  England — John,  the  third  son,  being 
the  late  Very  Reverend  the  Dean  of  Montreal,  and  Alexander  Neil,  the  fifth  son,  the 
late  Right  Reverend  Bishop  of  Toronto. 

The  Rev.  John  Bethune,  D.l).,  late  Dean  of  Montreal,  was  born  about  the  time 
his  father  removed  to  Upper  Canada,  ordained  in  1814,  and  was    fir^t  settled  at 
Augusta,  near  Brock ville.     In  1818,  he  became  Rector  of  Christ  Church,  Montreal. 
In  features  he  very  much  resembled  his  father.     An  admirable  portrait  likeness  of  the 
Dean  can  be  seen  in  the  Vestry  House  of  the  Cathedral.     In  1835,  ^''^  ^^''•^  appointed 
Principal  of  McGill  College.     J.  McGill,  the  founder,  wished  tlie  Rev.  Dr.  Strachan, 
who  was  afterwards  the  first  Bishop  of  Toronto,  but  the  Rector  of  that  city  then,  to 
be  the  Principal.     However,  he  declined,  and  the  choice  fell  on  the  late  Dean.     The 
college  question,  however,  not  being  ever  satisfactorily  settled,  a  new  charter  was  pro- 
cured in  1852,  and  the  present  regime  of  that  Institution  then  began.     From   1850, 
when  Montreal  District  became  a  separate  diocese  under  Bishop  Fulford,  the  Dean 
was  ever  prominent  in  ecclesiastical  affairs,  and  through  all  the  changes  of   chief 
Diocesan  Pastors,  and  meetings  of  both  Provincial  and  Local  Synods,  he  was  ever 
ready  to  advise  and  counsel  what  was  best  to  be  said  or  done.     He  was  more  than 
once   the  Bishop's  Commissary  during  the  absence  of  the  Head  of  the  Diocese   in 
England,  and  for  six  months  before  the  second  Bishop  was  elected.     During  his  long 
incumbency  he  saw  great  changes   in  the  city.     At  one  time  he  was  the  only  clergy- 
man of  the  Church  of  England  in  Montreal,  now  there  are  resident  at  this  day  over 
thirty.     After  an  honored  life  he  died  some  years  ago.

STRACIIAN  BETIIUNK,  Q.C. 

He  was  the  eldest  son  of  the  late  Very  Reverend  John  Eethune,  Dean  of  Montreal, 
and  was  born  on  the  6th  November,  1821.  After  a  successful  study  of  Law,  he  was 
called  to  the  Bar  of  Lower  Canada,  22nd  May,  1843.  He  was  appointed  Queen's 
Counsel  on  the  I2tli  February,  1864.  He  is  now  one  of  tlie  oldest  members  of  the 
Bar  of  Montreal,  and  has  held  different  positions  of  trust  in  the  Court  House  and  Bar 
from  tiie  hands  of  his  confreres,  who  liavc  always  highly  esteemed  him  for  intelligence, 
probity,  and  legal  lore.  He  still  continues  the  duties  of  his  profession,  his  sun  being 
associated  with  iiim  in  the  law  firm  of  Bethune  &amp;  Bethune.  For  many  years  he  has 
been  the  Chancellor  of  the  Diocese  of  Montreal,  and,  so  far  as  I  know,  has  never 
missed  for  a  (juarler  of  a  century  its  annual  meetings,  where,  with  his  well-limed 
remarks,  he  generally  settles  matters  when  they  begin  to  appear  irrational,  absurd, 
outrageous,  insignificant,  or  trilling,  as  is  always  seen  in  every  large  body  of  men — 
political,  classical  or  national,  who  gather  for  consultation,  research,  advice  or  govern- 
ment. His  eldest  daughter  is  married  to  the  \'en.  Archdeacon  Evans  of  Montreal. 
Two  others  are  married  in  England.  His  sister  married  Hon.  J.  J.  C.  Abbott,  now 
the  Premier  of  Canada,  so  that  the  sons  and  grandchildren  of  at  one  time  the  only 
Protestant  clergyman  in  Montreal  near  the  close  of  the  last  century  are  all  in  respon- 
sible phases  of  life  ;  and  to  the  founder  of  the  ftimily  may  be  applied  the  Biblical 
words,    "  A  little  one  will  become  a  thousand." 

DUNCAN  FISHER. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch,  and  from  whose  family  of  sons  and  daughters  so  many  of 
our  present  well-known  Montreal  families  are  descended,  was  born  in  Dunkeld, 
Scotland,  and  came  to  Montreal  very  soon  after  the  end  of  the  American  War  of 
Independence.  His  wife  was  Catherine  Embury,  daughter  of  Rev.  P.  Embury,  the 
pioneer  clergyman  of  Methodism  in  America. 

His  eldest  son,  Daniel,  a  merciiant  on  St.  Paul  street,  was  killed  by  an  explosion 
in  1826.  His  second  son,  John,  did  business  both  in  Montreal  and  Quebec.  From 
him  are  descended  Dr.  Arthur  Fisher  one  of  the  best  known  citizens  of  Montreal,  and 
his  sons,  Roswell  C.  Fisher,  advocate,  and  Sydney  A.  Fisher,  late  M.P.  for  Hrome. 

The  late  T.  W.  Ritchie,  Q.C,  was  married  to  a  daughter  of  John,  whose  son, 
W.  F.  Ritchie,  advocate,  is  associated  as  partner  with  Leo  H.  Davidson,  Esq.,  D.C.L., 
in  an  extensive  Law  practice  in  this  city,  and  his  daughter  has  greatly  distinguished 
herself  in  the  study  of  Medicine,  and  her  career  in  McGill  University  and  elsewhere 
is  a  remarkable  one. 

The  third  daughter  married  the  late  John  Torrance,  whose  flimily  are  connected 
with  that  of  Sir  A.  T.  Gait,  Rev.  Dr.  Matheson  and  the  late  Robert  Esdaile. 
The  third  son  married  a  sister  of  the  late  William  Lunn. 

The  son  who  most  distinguished  himself  was  Duncan,  and  by  marriage  became 
connected  with  Mr.  E.  H.  King,  once  President  of  the  Bank  of  Montreal.     He  was 
a  Q.C.  and  partner  of  the  late  Justice  Smith,   He  died  in  1845.     The  late  Judge  Tor- 
rance studied  in  his  office,  and  also  Judge  Cross,  who  married  his  niece.

HON.  LOUIS  OLIVIER  TAILLON,  Q.C., 

Was  born  at  Terrebonne,  i6tii  September,  1840,  and  educated  in  the  College  of 
Terrebonne,  in  company  wilii  the  Hon.  J.  A.  Ciia})leau,  Dr.  Desjardins  and  his 
brotlier,  A.  Desjardins,  Esq.,  M.  P.  for  llochelaga  County,  Rev.  L.  M.  Taillon,  Cure 
of  St.  Moniquc,  and  Rev.  F.  H.  Leclerc.  Wiien  he  had  completed  iiis  studies  he  en- 
tered as  an  ecclesiastic  and  was  Professor  in  the  College  for  six  years,  but  not  wishing 
to  proceed  any  further  in  Theology,  he  quitted  Masson  College  and  studied  Law. 
Mr.  Taillon  passed  successively  into  the  offices  of  Messrs.  Fabre,  Lesage  &amp;  Jett6 
and  Mr.  Laflamnie,  and  then  to  that  of  Mr.  Girouard.  After  his  admission  to  the 
Bar,  in  November,  1865,  lie  entered  the  office  of  the  latter-named  gentleman,  but  very 
soon  left  it  to  enter  into  partnership  with  the  late  Mayor  Rivard,  where  he  remained  till 
May,  1872,  wiien  he  formed  a  partnersiiip  with  the  Hon.  F,  X.  Trudel.  In  1875, 
Mr.  Taillon  was  returned  as  representative  of  Montreal  East  to  the  Local  Par- 
liament, and  re-elected  at  the  General  Election  in  1878  by  acclamation  ;  ap- 
pointed Speaker  of  the  House  in  1882,  and  Attorney  General  in  1884.  He  ever 
advocated  the  interests  of  liis  country  in  Parliament,  and  in  the  downfall  of  the 
Ross  Administration  at  Quebec,  in  1887,  Mr.  Taillon  was  called  as  the  Premier  to 
form  a  Conservative  Government,  but  the  fates  being  against  him  he  only  held  the 
position  a  short  time.  When  the  Mercier  Government  came  into  power,  Mr.  Taillon 
retired  from  politics,  and  directed  his  whole  time  to  the  duties  of  his  profession. 

Mr.  Tadlon  was  a  member  of  the  Committee  which  organized  the  grand  fete  of 
*'St.  Jean  Baptiste,"  in  1874,  and  as  one  of  the  Commissioners  of  that  day  he  greatly 
contributed  to  its  success.  At  the  dismissal  of  the  Mercier  Government  on  Dec.  2rst, 
1891,  he  was  invited  by  Hon.  Mr.  DeBouchervilie  to  enter  the  new  Cabinet,  which 
he  has  done,  without  portfolio.

WILLIAM  SCOTl'. 

The  subject  of  this  meimir  is  ushered  into  i)iiblic  life  as  a  baker  in  St.  I^awrence 
street  in  the  early  years  of  this  century.  His  son,  Wm.  H.  Scott,  was  a  merchant 
of  St.  Eustache,  and  a  staunch  rebel  in  1837-8.  I  find  his  commitment  in  the 
records  of  that  time,  thus:  "Committed  for  High  Treason,  William  H.  Scott,  of 
St.  Eustache."  This  was  on  the  19th  December,  1837.  After  remaining  some  time 
in  prison  he  was  discharged  on  bail,  and  became  after  the  Rebellion  such  a  loyal 
subject  that  he  was  returned  to  Parliament  for  Vwo  Mountains,  and  became  ever 
after  a  firm  supporter  of  Sir  Geo.  E.  Cartier. 

Another  son,  James,  died,  when  a  student,  from  a  wound  received  in  a  duel  with 
the  late  Sir  Wm.  Meredith,  Ciiief  Justice  of  Quebec. 

His  three  daughters  will  be  more  remembered  by  posterity  than  the  sons. 
Barbara  gave  $32,000  to  McGill  College  to  found  the  William  Scott  Chair  of  Civil 
Engineering,  and  $2,000  to  found  a  Scholarship  which  bears  her  name.  Anne  gave 
$17,600  to  the  Trafiilgar  Institute  when  she  died,  January  7,  1879.  Another  sister, 
Jane,  only  died  3rd  December,  1880,  aged  83,  and  left  $2,000  to  St.  Gabriel  Church  ; 
she  was  very  eccentric  and  retired. 

HON.  PETER  McGILL 

Was  born  at  Cree  Bridge,  Wigtonshire,  Scotland,  August,  1789.  When  twenty  years 
old  he  arrived  in  Montreal.  He  first  entered  the  employ  of  the  firm  of  Parker, 
Gerard,  Ogilve  &amp;  Co.,  and  afterwards  his  firm  was  styled  Peter  McGill  &amp;  Co.  Per- 
haps no  man.  at  least  no  Scotchman,  was  ever  more  respected  or  beloved.  This 
was  seen  in  his  election  as  first  Mayor  under  the  new  Constitution  in  1840,  when 
he  remained  in  office  for  three  years.  He  was  the  first  to  form  a  Volunteer  force, 
which  he  did  during  the  trying  season  of  1837.  For  the  long  period  of  twenty-six 
years  he  was  President  of  the  Bank  of  Montreal.  He  was  a  Director  of  the  G.  T.  R., 
and  Chairman  of  the  first  one  ever  run  in  Canada,  viz.,  "The  St.  Lawrence  and 
Champlain."  He  was  President  for  some  time  of  the  Bible  Society  and  Governor  of 
the  General  Hospital.  He  was  appointed  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Council,  No- 
vember, 1832,  and  when  the  Canadas  were  united  in  1840,  he  became  a  member  of  the 
united  Legislative  Council.  He  became  a  member  of  the  Executive  Council  under 
Lord  Elgin,  but  resigned  because  of  the  aspect  of  affairs  at  the  Rebellion  Losses 
Bill  in  1848.  He  became  a  Governor  of  McGill  College,  and  Trustee  of  Queen's 
College,  Kingston.     After  an  honorable  career,  he  died  in  Montreal.

CHARLES  SMALLWOOD,  M.D.,    LL.D. 

Doctor  Smallwood  is  entitled  to  rank  among  tlie  most  eminent  scientific  men  which 
this  Province  has  produced.  During  the  short  time  he  resided  in  Canada,  lie  con- 
tributed much  to  advance  the  brancli  of  science  to  which  he  chiefly  devoted  so  much 
of  his  valuable  professional  time  and  private  means. 

"  He  is  an  Englishman,  having  been  born  in  the  town  of  Birmingham,  in  the 
year  1812  ;  where  he  pursued  iiis  studies,  graduated  at  University  College,  and 
obtained  his  medical  degree.  He  came  to  Canada  in  the  year  1853,  and  in  1S54  he 
settled  at  St.  Martin,  Isle  Jesus,  where  he  acquired  a  large  practice  as  a  medical 
practitioner,  and  soon  after  established  iiis  meteorological  and  electrical  observatory, 
a  description  of  which  is  given  in  the  Smithsonian  Reports. 

He  discovered  the  effects  of  atmospheric  electricity  on  the  formation  of  the 
snow  crystal,  and  instituted  extensive  investigations  on  ozone  in  connection  with 
light,  electricity  and  the  effects  of  germination  of  seeds,  on  its  development  and 
effects  in  disease. 

In  1858,  Dr.  Smallwood  received  the  honorary  degree  of  LL.D.,  from  McGill 
College,  and  was  appointed  Professor  of  Meteorology  in  that  University.  In  i86c, 
he  obtamed,  through  the  liberality  of  the  Canadian  Government,  a  small  grant  for  the 
purchase  of  magnetic  instruments,  which  were  duly  received,  and  observations  were 
commenced  on  the  3rd  of  August,  1861. 

Dr.  Smallwood  contributed  largely  to  the  various  scientific  periodicals,  not  only 
in  this  country,  but  also  in  the  United  States  and  in  Europe.  He  is  likewise  the 
author  of  "  Contributions  to  Canadian  Meteorology^  The  object  of  the  whole  of 
these  observations  have  always  been  directed  to  practical  utility,  with  reference  to 
Medical  Science,  and  to  the  health  of  mankind.  They  have  been  written  during  the 
brief  intervals  which  he  could  snatch  from  a  very  active  and  laborious  professional 
life,  and  therefore  are  the  more  valuable  and  interesting. 

Dr.  Smallwood  was  one  of  the  Governors  of  the  College  of  Physicians  and 
Surgeons  of  Lower  Canada,  Member  of  the  British  Meteorological  Society,  of  the

JUDGE  W.  VV.  LYNCH,  D.C.L. 

We  liavo  pleasure  in  i)rescnting  our  readers  with  a  portrait  of  this  popular  public 
man,  whose  api)ointmcnt  on  the  5th  July,  1889,  to  the  position  of  Judge  of  the  Su- 
perior Court  of  the  Province  of  Quebec  was  hailed  with  satisfaction  by  the  entire 
community  without  regard  to  race,  creed  or  politics.  William  Warren  Lynch,  who 
had  been  for  over  twenty  years  engaged  in  political  life,  was  born  in  Betlford  in 
1845,  and  is  thus  in  the  prime  of  vigor  and  usefulness.  He  first  entered  the  Legis- 
lature in  187 1,  and  though  only  twenty-five  years  old,  was  soon  recognized  as  one  of 
the  leaders  of  the  Conservative  party.  His  judgment,  candor,  freedom  from  i)reju- 
dice  and  genial  manners  won  him  the  respect  of  both  friends  and  foes,  and  by  the 
former  he  was  implicitly  trusted  as  a  safe  guide  in  seasons  of  difiiculty.  His  former 
constituency  (Brome)  twice  elected  him  by  acclamation,  and  in  five  contests  gave 
him  large  majorities.  On  the  formation  of  the  Ciiapleau  Government  in  October, 
1879,  Mr.  Lynch  was  accepted  as  a  fit  person  to  represent  the  interests  of  the  Pro- 
testant minority,  and  he  was  admitted  to  the  Cabinet  as  Solicitor-General,  a  post 
which  he  held  till  its  abolition  in  July,  1882.  He  then  assumed  charge  of  tiie  De- 
partment of  Crown  Lands,  which  he  administered  with  his  wonted  ability  and  cir- 
cumspection until  tiie  defeat  of  the  Ross  Government  in  January,  1887.  Mr.  I-ynch 
has  been  a  member  of  the  Bar  for  more  than  twenty-one  years.  He  is  a  graduate  of 
McGill,  having  taken  his  B.C.L.  and  won  the  Elizabeth  Torrance  Gold  Medal  in 
1868.  He  is  also  a  D.C.L.,  honoris  causa,  of  Lennoxville  University,  in  which,  as 
in  his  alma  mater,  he  has  always  taken  a  deep  interest.  He  has  also  concerned 
himself  in  common  school  education,  and  has  served  on  the  Protestant  Committee  of 
the  Council  of  Public  Listruction.  It  was  he  who  initiated  the  movement  which 
resulted  successfully  at  the  last  Session  of  the  Legislature,  for  the  recognition  of  the 
B.A.  degree  as  suflicient,  without  examination,  to  secure  admission  to  the  study  of 
any  of  the  learned  professions.  He  was,  after  the  Session  of  1887,  appointed  by  the 
Attorney-General  one  of  the  Committee  to  revise  the  work  of  codifying  the  Statutes 
of  this  Province,  and  later  on  in  October,  1887,  he  was  named  by  the  Federal  Gov- 
ernment, in  connection  with  Mr.  Justice  Burbridge  and  Mr.  Dingman  of  the 
Indian  Department,  a  Commissioner  to  settle  the  Indian  title  to  lands  in  the  Town- 
ship of  Dundee,  and  he  has  always  been  credited  with  having  prepared  the  report 
upon  which  the  Government  finally  acted,  as  being  fair  to  Indians  and  settlers  alike. 
He  has  been  a  Queen's  Counsel  since  1880.  Mr.  Lynch's  home  has  always  been  at 
Knowlton.  In  September,  1887,  he  removed  to  Montreal  to  practise  his  profession, 
which  he  did  there  until  his  appointment  to  the  Bench,  in  connection  with  J.  S. 
Archibald,  Q.C.,and  George  G.  Foster.  As  Judge  Lynch's  patriotic  spirit,  firmness 
and  integrity  have  won  him  universal  esteem  in  public  life,  so  in  social  intercourse 
he  is  a  favorite  with  all  classes.     He  is  sure  to  do  credit  to  the  Judicial  Bench.

Was  born  at  L'Islct,  Quebec,  on  tlie  6th  September,  1S2S.  Ilis  father  was  Cfcrmain 
Verreaii,  and  his  mother,  Marie  Ursiile  Foiirnier.  He  was  educated  at  the  Quebec 
Seminary,  and  after  his  graduation  taught  for  two  years  in  tliat  institution.  At  the 
early  age  of  twenty-one  years,  he  went  to  St.  'I'herese  College  as  the  Principal,  which 
position  he  occupied  for  the  next  eight  years.  In  1.S56,  M.  Wrreau  removed  to 
Montreal,  and  in  1857  he  became  the  Principal  of  the  Jacques  Cartier  Normal  School 
when  it  was  instituted,  a  position  he  has  filled  to  this  day,  a  period  of  nearly  thirty- 
four  years.  In  1873,  the  Provincial  (lovernment  sent  him  to  Europe  to  make 
investigations  there  regarding  Canadian  History.  The  result  of  this  trip  was  the 
]niblisliing  of  most  interesting  items  by  the  Government  in  their  Report  on  Agricul- 
ture. Principal  Verreau  is  a  Doctor  of  Letters  and  an  Ofiiccr  of  Public  Instruction, 
France,  which  position  was  granted  him  by  the  French  Government.  M.  Verreau 
was  ordained  Priest  in  1851  by  Bishop  Prince,  and  he  frequently  officiates,  though 
such  a  busy  man  in  the  Normal  School.  L'Abbe  Verreau  has  written  some  articles 
on  Canadian  History,  and  it  is  a  pity  for  the  ccnmtry  at  large  that  he  could  not  be 
induced  to  partly  give  up  his  laborious  work  and  devote  himself  and  his  splendid 
talents  to  jjurely  literary  work. 


HON.  JUDGE  MOUSSEAU,  Q.C.,  M.P. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  at  Berthier,  i6th  July,  1838.  He  was  the  son 
of  Louis  Mousseau,  and  grandson  of  Louis  Mousseau,  who  sat  in  the  Quebec  Assembly 
as  one  of  its  members  for  several  years.  He  was  called  to  the  Bar  of  Lower  Canada 
in  i860,  and  early  showed  great  aptitude  in  his  profession,  which  resulted  in  his  being 
made,  in  1873,  a  Queen's  Counsellor.  He  was  one  of  the  partners  of  the  firm  of 
Mousseau,  Chapleau  &amp;  Archambault.  Mr.  Mousseau  was  well  known  as  a  political 
writer  and  for  the  periodical  press.  He  was  one  of  the  founders  of  La  Coloni- 
zateur  newspaper  in  1862,  of  VOpinion  fubliqiie  in  1870.  He  is  the  author  of 
a  pamphlet  in  defence  of  Confederation  against  the  attacks  cf  the  Opposition,  1869, 
which  was  highly  thought  of  when  it  appeared.  He  also  wrote  a  brochure  "  Car- 
dinal &amp;  Diiquet,  victimesde  1837-38."  He  was  first  returned  to  Parliament  for  Bagot 
V*^  County,  1S70,  and  re-elected  in  1878.  He  moved  the  expulsion,  in  1879,  ^^  Lieut.- 
Governor  Letellier  from  office — the  results  of  which  are  hardly  smoothed  at  this  day, 
1 891.  He  became  one  of  the  Privy  Council,  resigning  for  Hon.  Mr.  Chapleau,  and 
exchanging  for  him  as  the  Premier  of  Quebec.  His  ministry  being  defeated  after- 
wards, lie  was  elevated  to  the  Bench  and  died  some  years  ago.

Was  born  in  Stiiartficld,  Al)crcIt'L'iishire,  Scotland,  on  ilu-  isi  January,  1820.  His 
father  was  the  Rev.  James  Kobertson  of  that  place,  where  lie  had  l)een  Tastor  of  the 
Congregational  Church  for  thirty  years.  He  afterwards  resigned,  and  ("anie  to  this 
coinitry  in  1832,  and  went  to  Derby,  N'erniont.  and  remained  there  nearly  four  years  ; 
then  came  to  Sherbrooke  in  May,  1836,  and  became  Pastor  of  the  .Sherbrooke  Congre- 
gational Church  for  twenty-five  years,  where  i)e  died  in. September,  1861,  full  of  years 
and  Christian  work. 

Joseph  finisli!'!  Iiis  education  in  .Sherl)rooke,  became  a  merchant  there,  and  re- 
tired some  years  ago.  Was  for  years  President  of  the  Stanslead  iV  Sherbrooke  Mutual 
Life  Insurance  Company,  and  I'resident  of  the  (Quebec  Central  Kaihvay  ("ompany, 
and  was  its  principal  originator,  and  most  ardent  supporter  '"or  many  years.  Is  now, 
and  has  been  for  many  years,  President  of  the  Sherbrooke  .Agricultural  Society.  Was 
Secretary-Treasurer  of  the  County  of  Siierbrooke  for  the  establishment  of  ('oimty 
Councils,  till  the  i)resent  system  of  Township  Councils  came  into  operation.  Was 
Mayor  of  Sherbrooke  for  eighteen  years,  and  President  of  the  Temperance  League  in 
1870-71. 

He  was  elected  to  the  Provincial  Assembly  for  Sherbrooke  in  1.S67,  and  has 
since  then  held  tin's  important  jiosition.  He  was  appointed  a  member  of  the  Lxe- 
cutive  Council  in  1869  in  the  CHiauveau  Cabinet  as  Treasurer  of  the  Province,  and 
held  that  office  in  all  for  eleven  years  and  six  months,  under  lour  succeeding 
administrations.  In  1874.  he  was  sent  to  Lngland  to  lloal  a  loan  of  $4,000,000, 
which  he  successfully  accomplished,  and  on  his  return  some  two  thousand  citizens  of 
Sherbrooke  turned  out  to  congratulate  him  on  his  success.  In  1S70,  he  married 
Mary,  daughter  of  A.  (i.  Woodward,  of  Sherbrooke. 

The  family  of  the  Rev.  Mr.  Robertson  has  abunilantly  jiroved  that  they  have  all 
come  of  a  good  stock.  Perhaps  no  man  in  the  legal  fraternity  of  the  City  of  Mon- 
treal was  belter  known  in  his  day  than  Andrew  Robertson,  (^.C.  He  was  one  of 
the  brightest  jewels  in  the  galaxy  of  Montreal  lawyers,  and  his  quieland  unostentatious 
manner  secured  him  the  respect  and  profound  admiration  and  confidence  of  his 
confreres.  He  died  in  March,  1880,  universally  lamented  as  an  upright  Christian 
man. 

Another  brother,   (ieorge,  also    in  the    legal  profession,   and  partner  with  his 
brother  Andrew  for  many  years   in   Montreal,    was  a   successful  lawyer,  and  much 
esteemed  by  his  confreres   and  the   general   public.     He   died  in   Sherbrooke,  Feb- 
ruary, 187 1. 

To  another  brother,  William,  can  be  applied  much,  if  not  all,  of  the  encomiums 
of  his  brother  Andrew.  He  is  a  well-known  lawyer  of  Montreal,  and  universally 
esteemed  by  all  shades  of  political  opinion,  and  by  all  sorts  and  conditions  of  men. 
He  now  represents  one  of  the  largest  legal  firms  in  the  city.  ^._.:'

In   the    ye;ir   17C17.    the    fatlur    of  Dr.    Holmes    was    on  his  way    to  Canada 
with  his    wife,    when  the    vessel  in    which    he    sailed  was    captured  by    a    JMeiich

bapli/ed  at  the  Church  of  Si.  Jago  by  the  name  of  Andrew  Lernando.    The  family 
reached  Canada  in  1801.     In   1811,   he   was   articled  to  the  late  Dr.   Arnoldi,  with 
whom  he  studied   for  several   years,  after  which  he  went  to  Kdinburgh   to  complete 
liis  studies,  and  thence  to  Paris.      L'  iSig,  he  returned  to  Canada  with  the  diploma 
of  ^LD.,  and  began  the  practice  of  his  i)rofession  as  a  partner  of  his  fjrmer  patron. 
'I'his  [)artner,-ihip  being  subsequently  dissolved,  he  continued  to  practice  alone  up  to 
the  day  of  his  death.     After  his  return,   in  1824,  with  the   late  Drs.   Caldwell  and 
Robertson,  he  founded  the  Montreal  School  of  Medicine,  known   afterwards  as  the 
"Montreal  Medical  Institution,"  which,  when  the  University  of  McGill  College  was 
set  in  operation  in  1828  or  1829,  was  merged  in  the  Medical  Faculty  of  that  institu- 
tion.    This  school  has  long  ranked  among  the  foremost  on  this  Continent,  and  has 
been    a  boast  of  Montreal.     Up  to   the  year   1836  he   filled  the  chair  of  Materia 
Medica  and  Chemistry,     hi  that  year  the  duty  was  divided,   he  taking   Chemistry 
alone,  which  he  held  till  1842,  when  he  succeeded  Dr.  Robertson  in  the  chair  which 
he  held  up  to  the  day  of  his  death.     At  the  reorganization  of  the   Faculty  in  1854,

years  the  study  of  the  natural  sciences  with  great  zeal  and  success,  winning  for  him- 
self reputation  as  a  Naturalist,  in  days  when  students  in  those  fields  lacked  the  many 
aids  and   incitements  to  diligence   possessed  now.     His  herbarium,  consisting  of  a

Jean  IUptiste  Mkh.leur  was  indeed  one  of  the  literati  of  Canada,  and  a  gentle- 
man of  many  attainments,  to  whose  efforts  we  owe  much  of  the  i)resent  admirable 
system  of  education  in  this  i)rovince.  Born  at  St.  Laurent  in  1796,  he  was  educated 
in  the  College  of  Montreal,  admitted  to  Medic;ine  in  1825.  and  returned  to  Parliament 
in  1834.     He  was  the  first  Superintendent  of  Education  for  Lower  Canada. 

At  the  request  of  Lord  Durham,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Abbe  Duchaiiie,  he 
conducted  a  polemical  contest  on  the  subject  of  electricity,  and  was  engaged  giving 
lectures  on  the  foundation  of  the  Society  of  Natural  History,  when  he  was  apjjoinled 
Superintendent  of  Public  Lislruction  by  Sir  Charles  JJagot,  with  the  promise  of  that 
Governor  that  the  situation  should  not  be  made  a  i)oliiical  one.  He  made  two  trips 
round  Lower  Canada,  to  obtain  information  as  to  its  extension,  but  failed.  During 
the  fifteen  years  and  upwards  that  he  occupied  this  elevated  station,  he  contributed 
from  the  funds  of  the  department  to  the  foundation  of  forty-five  superior  educational 
establishments.  He  afterwards  was  Postmaster  of  Montreal,  an  office  from  which 
he  retired  and  went  to  reside  in  Quebec. 

Dr.  Meilleur  was  a  member  of  several  learned  American  and  Canadian  institu-

GENERAL  LORD  DORCHESTER,  K.H. 

a  The  iKimc  of  Dorchester  deserves  to  be  nn'iitionccl  witli  the  greatest  eulogy  and 
praise,  for  the  great  services  he  rendered  Canada  in  tiie  two  capacities  in  which  he 
served  her  interests,  as  Commander-in-Chief,  and  as  her  (lovernorand  tiie  preserver 
of  her  high  destinies. 

''  (liiy  Carleton,  Lord  Dorcliester  (the  Saviour  of  Quebec,  as  he  is  called)  rvas  the 
descendant  of  an  ancient  and  honored  family,  which  had  lived  in  Cornwall,  J'higland, 
five  centuries  previous  to  the  Norman  conquest.  He  was  born  about  the  year  1725, 
and  being  destined  for  the  army,  entered  its  ranks  after  completing  liis  studies,  and 
speedily  made  his  way  onward  in  the  service.  He  accompanied  Wolfe's  e\i)edition 
to  Canada,  and  was  present  at  the  hrst  and  second  battles  on  Abraham's  I'lains,  in 
both  of  which  he  displayed  such  skill  and  jjrecision  in  commanding  the  part  of  the 
army  under  his  c(;nnnand,  as  to  leave  no  doubt  on  the  minds  of  his  sujjerior  officers 
that  he  would  rise  to  distinction  in  the  profession  he  had  chosen.  Being,  we  believe, 
speciallv  mentioned  in  the  despatches  of  both  Townshend  and  Murray,  and  having 
continued  luider  the  command  of  the  latter,  was  inomoted  to  the  rank  of  ]5rigadier- 
General.  In  1767,  (leneral  Murray  having  to  proceed  to  England,  the  govermiient 
of  the  colony  devolved  on  Carleton,  who  was  much  liked  by  the  French  Canadians 
and  tlie  English  (of  whom  there  were  then  few)  generally.  In  1770,  he  proceeded  to 
J'jigland  on  leave  of  absence,  and  whilst  there,  the  celebrated  Quebec  Act  passed  the 
Houses  of  Parliament,  and  some  ascribe  it  in  a  great  measure  to  re])resentations  he 
made  to  the  Home  (lovernment  respecting  Canada,  it  being  well  known  that  he  carried 
home  a  compiled  form  of  the  French  civil  laws,  or  Coiituines  dc  Paris,  for  the  con- 
sideration of  the  Imjierial  authorities.  In  1774,  General  Carleton  returned  to  Canada, 
and  look  prompt  measures  to  carry  out  the  provisions  of  his  new  instructions  relative 
to  the  Act  just  i)assed.  He  had,  however,  little  time  to  think  or  act  upon  this 
matter,  for  the  next  year  the  Americans,  having  declared  their  independence,  entered 
Canada  in  large  forces,  with  the  hostile  intention  of  wresting  it  from  the  hands  of  the 
English  ;  but  they  made  a  sad  mistake  in  their  estimate  of  the  man  they  had  to  deal 
with  ;  brave  and  gallant,  and  of  chivalrous  courage,  and  yet  perfectly  cool  and  self- 
possessed  in  the  greatest  and  most  critical  moments,  Carleton,  although  with  but  eight 
hundred  men  at  his  disposal — all  attempts  to  coax  or  coerce  the  natives  to  assist  him 
proving  fruitless — at  once  took  measures  to  prevent  the  meditated  attack.  On  the 
17th  September,  Montgomery,  with  his  army,  amounting  to  two  thou.sand,  arrived  at 
Isle-aux-Noix ;  the  fall  of  Chambly  and  St.  Johns  followed,  and  Carleton,  in  his 
endeavor  to  succor  the  latter,  received  a  check  from  a  part  of  the  Americans,  near 
Longueuil,  which  compelled  him  to  retreat  to  Montreal.  Here,  anticipating  the 
intention  of  Montgomery  to  take  possession  of  the  town,  he  burnt  and  destroyed  all 
the  public  and  valuable  stores,  and  left  the  city  one  way,  just  as  the  American  General 
was  entering  at  the  other.  During  the  night,  he  had  a  narrow  escape  from  the 
enemy,  who  was  encamped  at  Sorel,  and  whose  sentinels    he  had  to  pass  in  an  opea

boat ;  this  ho  accomplished  with  the  aid  of  muffled  oars,  and  arrived  at  Quebec  on 
the  iglh  November,  to  the  great  joy  of  the  people.  He  hastily  made  the  most 
judicious  arrangements  in  his  power,  for  Arnold  and  Montgomery  were  advancing, 
and  expelled  from  the  city  all  those  he  thought  were  disaffected,  who  would  not 
volunteer  to  defend  it,  and  assist  in  strengthening  the  works. 

"  The  united  forces  of  Montgomery  and  Arnold  succeeded  in  gaining  the  city  on  the 
4th  of  December,  ;ind  after  concocting  their  ])lans,  divided  their  forces  so  as  to  attack 
the  city  in  several  places;  this  Carlelon,  nowise  intimidated,  became  cognizant  of, 
and  on  the  Americans  raising  the  siege,  took  renewed  measures  for  the  safety  of  the 
place.  On  the  31st,  Montgomery  was  killed  ;  Arnold  and  Mf)rgan's  forces  were 
routed  at  first  and  captured  afterwards,  and  the  remnant  of  'he  American  army  com. 
pelled  to  retreat  to  some  distance  from  the  city.  On  being  reinforced,  however, 
during  the  winter  they  made  a  stand  for  another  attack  on  Quebec,  but  disease  and 
famine  at  last  comitelled  them  to  retreat,  being  actually  chased  towards  Sorel  by  the 
gallant  Carleton.  In  the  spring,  when  the  reinforcements  arrived  from  England,  he 
possessed  himself  of  Crown  I'oint,  and  launched  a  fine  fleet  on  Lake  Champlain, 
which,  after  several  actions,  completely  annihilated  that  of  the  Americans.  In  1777, 
upon  Burgoyne  being  appointed  Commander-in-Chief  in  America,  Carleton,  thinking 
that  he  had  been  slighted  by  the  Government  after  his  brilliant  successes,  at  once 
dciuanded  his  recall,  and  proceeded  to  England.  His  suspicions,  although  well- 
founded,  were,  notwithstanding,  unjust;  for  on  his  jjroceeding  to  i'aigland,  he  was 
well  received  by  his  sovereign,  who  conferred  upon  him  the  honor  of  knighthood. 

"In  the  year  1782,  he  was  appointed  as  the  successor  of  Sir  Henry  Clinton, 
Commander-in-Chief  of  all  His  Majesty's  forces  in  America.  He  arrived  at  New  York 
with  his  commission  in  the  beginning  of  May.  After  the  treaty  of  peace  was  signed, 
he  delayed  for  some  time  the  evacuation  of  the  city,  from  regard  to  the  safety  of  the 
loyalists;  but  on  November  25th,  1783,  he  embarked,  and  withdrew  the  British  ships 
from  America.  In  1786,  on  returning  to  Fngland,his  grateful  Sovereign  was  pleased 
to  raise  him  to  the  peerage  as  Lord  Dorchester,  and  Parliament  voted  him  a  pension 
of  £1,000  i)er  annum  during  his  own  life,  and  the  lives  of  his  wife  and  two  elder 
sons  ;  and  towards  the  latter  end  of  the  same  year,  he  was  again  appointed  Oovernor- 
General  andCai)tain-General  of  Q';ebec,  and  Commander-in-Chief  of  the  forces  therein 
His  re-appearance  in  Canada  was  hailed  with  delight  by  the  majority  of  the  jieople. 
Ke  continued  to  govern  the  province  until  1796,  and  during  that  time  did  much 
towards  the  welfare  of  the  country,  particularly  ''n  ameliorating  the  laws. 

"  On  his  final  departure,  the  unfeigned  regret  that  was  expressed  was  universal, 
and  many  were  the  addresses  presented  by  the  inhabitants  to  the  good  old  General, 
conveying  their  heartfelt  gratitude  for  all  that  he  had  done,  and  prayers  for  his  eternal 
welfare. 

"  His  lordship,  although,  it  appeared,  a  very  strict  disciplinarian  in  the  execution 
of  his  duty,  was  as  humane  and  kind  of  heart  as  any  man  that  ever  breathed  ;  indeed, 
his  kind  treatment  of  the   French  Canadians  during  his  government  and  of  the

American  prisoners  during  the  American  war  evinces  that  in  the  highest  degree.     He 
was,  besides,  a  man  of  honor  and  a  gentleman,  a  sincere  Christian,  and  a  devoted 
soldier  and  servant  of  his  country.     He  married,  in  1772,  Lady  Maria,  daughter  of 
the  second  Ivarl  of  Efiiinghani,  by  whom  he  had  many  children.     His  death  occurred 
on  the  19th  November,  1808,  in  the  fine  old  age  of  eighty-three." 

HON.  GEORGE  PYKE 

Was  born  at  Halifiix,  N.S.,  1775.  He  practised  as  a  Barrister  in  Quebec,  and 
held  the  offices  of  Solicitor  and  Attorney-General  and  Advocate-General.  He 
was  promoted  to  the  Bench  of  Montreal  about  the  year  1820.  He  delivered  the 
great  judgment  of  the  Court,  maintaining  the  claim  of  the  Cliurch  of  England  to  the 
University  of  McGill  College,  but  which  by  mismanagement  has  been  lost  to  that 
Christian  body.  He  retired  about  the  year  1844,  and  went  to  live  at  his  country 
residence  in  the  Seigniory  of  Vaudreuil,  Hud'^on,  which  was  beautifully  situated  on 
the  banks  of  the  River  Ottawa,  and  wiiich  he  named  "  Mount  Victoria." 

He  died  at  Hudson,  1851,  aged  76,  much  regretted.  He  left  three  sons,  viz., 
George,  for  many  years  a  chief  clerk  in  the  Prolhouotary's  Ofiice  of  Montreal, 
afierwaids  Deputy  Prothonotary,  and  who  died  in  1882.  John  (M.  D.)  who  died

in  the  Diocese  of  Montreal,  and  fifty  years  in  the  same  Parish,  which  no  other  clergy- 
man of  any  denomination  can  say  in  the  District  of  Montreal.  He  is  now  in  his 
75th  year,  and  has  seen  great  changes  in  the  country  since  his  appointment  to  the 
Mission  of  Vaudreuil. 

HENRY  HOWARD,  M.D.,  M.R.C.S.L.  Eng., 

Was  born  in  Nenagh,  County  Tii)perary,  Ireland,  on  the  ist  December,  1815,  and 
studied  medicine  in  Dublin  under  the  celebrated  Dr.  Jacob.  He  took  his  degree  in 
London,  England,  in  1838,  emigrating  to  Canada  in  1842,  first  residing  on  Amherst 
Island,  afterwards  in  Kingston,  coming  to  Montreal  in  1845.  He  practised  iiis  profession 
in  Montreal  till  1861,  when  he  was  appointed  Superintendent  of  the  Provincial  Lunatic 
Asylum,  St.  Johns,  Q.,  which  position  he  occupied  till  1875,  when  he  received 
the  appointment  of  Government  Sui)erintendent  of  the  Longue  Pointe  Lunatic 
Asylum,  which  position  he  filled  until  the  day  of  his  death.  Dr.  Howard  was  author 
of  several  works,  those  most  noted  being  "  The  Anatomy,  Physiology  and  Pathology 
of  the  Eye,"  "The  Philosophy  of  Insanity,  Crime  and  Responsibility,"  "The 
Somatic  Etiology  of  Crime,"  and  other  works.  He  was  an  honorary  member  of  the 
American  Association  for  the  Cure  of  Inebriates,  and  an  ex-president  of  the  Medico- 
Chirurgical  Society  of  Montreal,  being  its  oldest  member  at  the  time  of  his  death. 
Dr.  Howard  was  a  i)ersonality  in  his  profession  and  as  a  public  man,  through  his 
long  public  career  of  Superintendent  of  the  Insane.     His  views  on  the  subject  of

llie  unbalancing  of  the  niiiul  were  quite  pronounee'l,  and  m  sevei.il  printed  works  he 
laid  down  the  doctrine  of  Moral  insanity,  and  upheld  tlie  efisenlial  relations  between 
physical  lesion  and  mental  and   moral  obliquity.     In  his  professional  relations  I)r. 
Ho\/ard  was  highly  esteemed  for  his  old-fashioned  sense   of  etiquette  and   the  ob- 
servance of  the   normal  jiropricties.      In   the   intimacy  of  private  life,  he  was  a  most 
estimable  man,  devotedly  attached  to  his  family,  and  thoroughly  sympathetic  to  a 
wide  circle  of  friends.      The  Doctor  was  good  company,  and  had  the  gift  of  anec- 
dote and  broad  reminiscence  of  men  and  things.     He  liked  to  recall  Ins  student  days 
in  the  old  country,  and  his  political  adventures  in  Montreal,  esj;iecially  in  the  case  of 
St.  Patrick's  Society,  of  wiiich  he  was  at  one  time  one  of  its  most  honored  Presidents. 
He  died  at  the  age  of  seventy-two,  on  the  12th  of  (Jctober,  1SS7,  altera  life  well 
spent,  and  left  behind  him  the  legacy  of  a  name  honored  by  the  public  at  large,  and 
beloved  by  his  personal  friends.    He  fought  the  battle  of  life  with  credit  to  himself,  and 
with  bei'   fit  to  the  nation — none  the  less  great,  because  his  worlli  was  what  all  true 
worth  is,  unassimiing  and  modest. 

LOUIS  L.    L.   r)l-:SAUI.NIERS,  M.U., 

Was  born  at  Vamachiche,  Quebec,  i6th  February,  1823.  He  is  descended  from  an 
old  and  well-known  family,  three  of  his  brothers  having  been  Professors  of  Philosophy, 
Mathematics  and  Theology  in  tiie  Colleges  of  Nicolet  and  St.  Hyacinthe.  He  studied 
chiefly  at  Harvard  University,  Boston,  where  he  graduated  M.D.  in  1S46.  Since 
1876  he  lias  resided  in  Montreal.  He  has  been  for  years  a  member  of  the  Council 
of  Public  Instruction,  is  also  a  member  of  the  Medical  Society  of  Mass.,  U.  S.,  and 
for  the  i)ast  twenty-three  years  he  has  been  one  of  the  Inspectors  of  Prisons  and 
Asylums  for  the  Province  of  Quebec.  The  writer  has  had  now  an  intercourse  of  all 
this  time  with  Dr.  Desaulniers,  and  has  ever  found  him  a  gentleman  both  in  his  official 
visitations  and  in  private  life.  Through  hi;:  indefatigable  exertions  much  of  the  great 
change  to  be  seen  in  the  condition  of  the  criminal  classes,  and  other  letter  means  of 
classification,  etc.,  are  due  to  him,  and  the  separation  of  the  sexes  in  separate  prisons 
was  finally  brought  about  by  the  work  and  perseverance  of  Dr.  Desaulniers  and  his 
colleagues. 

JOHN    A.   PROCTOR 

Was  born  at  Liverpool,  England,  in  1833,  and  came  to  Canada  in  1838.  For  some 
time  he  was  a  Professor  in  the  University  of  Lennoxville.  His  poems  were  published 
in  the  different  journals  of  the  day,  but  principally  in  the  Gazette^  of  Montreal. 
His  "Essays  of  a  Ragged  Philosopher"  appeared  in  The  Freeman  of  Sherbrooke. 
In  1861,  he  published  his  book,  "  Voices  of  the  Night."  This  work  on  its  appearance 
stamped  him  as  a  poet  of  no  mean  ability.  He  has  written  several  other  poems 
since.

to  the  College,  and  endowed  the  Joseph  Mackay  Chair  of  Systematic  'I'heology  in 
the  College.  His  nephews,  Hugh,  Robert,  and  James,  have  also  followed  their

been  identified  with  all  progressive  measures  looking  toward  the  improvement  and 
extension  of  the  trade  of  Montreal.  Mackay  Bros,  have  been  important  factors  in 
aiding  to  develop  the  commercial  greatness  of  the  city  and  make  its  name  more 
widely  known  beyond  the  bounds  of  Canada.  The  past  record  of  this  house  is 
perhaps  the  best  guarantee  for  its  future.  Honorable  it  has  been,  and  marked  by 
intelligence  and  enterprise.  These  have  their  reward  in  a  steady  and  successful 
trade.  Long  may  it  flourish  as  one  of  die  old  solid  names  of  Montreal,  and  a 
landmark  that  may  not  easily  be  obliterated.

''  Father  Dowd,  as  his  parishioners  love  to  call  him,  was  born  in  the  County  Louth, 
Ireland,  in  1813.  At  an  early  age  he  evinced  an  ardent  desire  to  devote  himself  to  the 
Church,  and  made  his  classical  course  at  Newry.  He  went  to  Paris  in  1832,  when 
he  made  his  theological  studies  in  the  Irish  College  in  that  city  ;  his  course  was  a 
brilliant  one.  In  1837,  May  20th,  he  was  ordained  Priest  by  Monseigneur  Quelan, 
Archbishop  of  Paris.  After  his  ordination,  he  returned  to  Ireland  where  he  lived 
about  ten  years,  six  with  the  Archbishop  of  Armagh,  and  was  President  of  the  Dio- 
cesan Seminary  of  that  town  for  one  year. 

In  1847,  li^  resolved  on  joining  the  order  of  St.  Sulpice,  and  weut  to  Paris  for 
that  purpose.  After  spending  a  year  in  that  novic'ate  he  was  admitted  a  member  of 
that  illustrious  body.  He  came  to  Monucal,  21st  June,  1848,  and  officiated  at  St. 
Patrick's  Church.  When  Father  Connolly  left  St.  Patrick's,  in  i860.  Father  Dowd 
was  appointed,  by  the  Superior,  Director  of  the  congregation,  a  position  which  he 
retained  to  hi?  death. 

Shortly  after  his  arrival  he  saw  the  necessity  of  an  asylum  for  Irish  orphans 
here,  and  early  in  1849  established  one,  and  the  same  year  commenced  the  building 
of  the  present  St.  Patrick's  Orphan  Asylum,  which  was  opened  in  November,  1851. 

In  1865,  he  established  St.  Bridget's  Home  for  the  old  and  infirm,  and  the  Night 
Refuge  for  the  destitute.  In  1866-7,  he  erected  the  present  commodious  building 
on  Lagauchetierc  street  for  the  Home  and  Refuge. 

In  1872,  he  established  Si.  Patrick's  School  on  St.  Alexander  street,  opposite  the 
Church, — the  building  is  large  and  commodious.  This  school  is  for  girls,  and  is  con- 
ducted by  the  Rev.  Ladies  of  the  Congregation  of  Notre  Dame,  whose  reputation  as 
educators  is  known  all  over  America.     Over  five  hundred  pupils  attend  this  school. 

Besides  the  above  Father  Dowd  has  done  much  to  ornament  and  beautify  the 
interior  of  St.  Patrick's  Church,  which  next  to  Notre  Dame  is  the  most  richly 
decorated  in  this  city. 

In  1866,  when  the  dismemberment  of  the  ancient  parish  of  Notre  Dame  was 
proclaimed.  Father  Dowd's  quick  and  vigilant  eye  saw  that  the  congregation  of 
St.  Patrick's,  and  the  other  Irish  churches  of  this  city,  would  suffer  seriously  thereby, 
and  he  promptly  petitioned  the  Holy  See  that  the  Irish  Catholics  of  Montreal  should 
be  left  in  the  undisturbed  possession  of  their  old  privileges  ;  his  petition  was 
received  and  substantially  granted,  and  their  position  confirmed  and  defined  to  their 
satisfaction. 

In  1877,  he  organised  the  great  Irish  Catholic  Pilgrimage  to  Lourdes  and  Rome. 
We  can  all  recollect  the  prayerful  anxiety  that  was  felt,  when  the  vessel  carrying  the 
pilgrims  and  their  beloved  Pastor  was  not  heard  of  for  several  agonizing  weeks 
Prayers  were  offered  in  all  the  churches  without  distinction  of  creed,  a  pleasing  proof 
that  we  Montrealers  are  not  so  bigoted  or  intolerant  as  some  would  make  us  appear. 

When  God  in  His  great  mercy  was  pleased  to  restore  them  to  their  homes  and 
friends,  Father  Dowd  met  with  an  enthusiastic  reception,  and  was  presented  with  a 
life-size  portrait  of  himself  for  the  Presbytery  of  St.  Patrick's,  where  it  now  hangs.

F.'Uher  Dowel  has,  on  several  occasions,  been  ofleied  the  highest  dignities  in  the 
cliiirch,  but  has  always  declined  them, —  twice  at  least  having  refused  the  mitre, 
namely: — the  Sees  of  Toronto  and  Kingston.  On  December  17th,  1852,  he  was 
named  Bishop  of  Can6e,  in  partibus,  and  Coadjutor  of  Toronto,  but  declined, 
preferring  to  remain  with  the  St.  I'atrick's  congregation." 

It  is  impossible  in  this  brief  sketch  to  do  full  justice  to  the  Rev.  Pastor  of  St. 
Patrick's  ;  indeed,  to  write  his  memoir  in  full,  since  he  came  to  this  city  in  1848,  W(juld 
be  to  write  the  history  of  the  Irish  Catholics  of  Montreal  for  the  last  fifty  years,  so 
intimately  has  he  been  associated  with  eveiy  good  and  charitable  work.  One  trait 
of  his  Catholic  life  must  be  recorded,  and  appertaining  to  the  Author  ol  this  Book. 
More  than  a  quarter  of  a  century  ago,  he  published  a  volume  as  a  Reader  for 
schools,  containing  everything  jiertainiiig  to  British  North  America.  His  great 
friend  Father  Dowd  was  one  of  the  Council  &lt;jf  Public  Instruction.  When  the  book 
was  discussed  at  the  Council  table  as  one  of  those  to  be  the  auihoiized  books  for  all 
kinds  of  schools,  Father  Dowd  firmly  said  :  "I  will  not  rise  from  this  meeting  till  that 
excellent  book  is  adopted,"  and  adopted  it  was  ;  and  in  the  Statutes  of  Quebec  in 
the  Education  Act  mention  is  made  of  this  same  book,  and  what  regulation  was  to 
appertain  thereto  in  the  examination  of  future  teachers  for  the  Province.  Ifc  died 
on  the  iQih  December,  1891,  full  of  years  and  Christian  work,  and  his  funeral  was 
one  of  the  largest  ever  seen  in  Montreal.  All  denominations  attended  the  service, 
and  showed  that  all  nationalities  were  determined  to  do  respect  to  the  good  old  man. 

SIR  ALEXANDER  GALT,  Cl.C.M.G., 
Is  the  youngest  son  of  John  (lalt,  a  name  not  unknown  both  in  literature  and  (Canada, 
as  he  was  the  author  of  several  books  and  the  founder  of  the  populous  and  important 
town  of  (ialt  in  Ontario.  The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  at  Chelsea,  England, 
6th  September,  1817.  He  early  came  to  Canada  in  connection  with  the  British 
American  Land  Co.,  and  lived  in  Sherbrooke.  In  1844,  he  was  appointed  Commis- 
sioner, and  for  twelve  years  after  held  this  important  position.  In  1849,  ^''-  ^^^'^ 
entered  Parliament  as  the  rei)resentative  of  Sherbrooke.  Retiring  from  political  life 
for  some  years  he  again  entered  it  in  1853  and  once  more  represented  Sherbrooke, 
which  he  continued  to  do  till  Confederation,  when  the  Brown-Dorion  Administration 
came  to  an  end.  Sir  Edmund  Head,  the  Governor-General,  invited  Mr.  Gait  to  form  a 
new  Ministry,  but  he  declined.  In  the  Cartier-MacDonald  Government,  Mr.  Gait 
accepted  the  position  of  Minister  of  Finance.  In  1864,  he  became  again  same  minister 
in  the  Tach^-MacDonald  Government. 

In  the  first  Dominion  Government  under  Sir  John  MacDonald,  he  again  was 
the  Minister  of  Finance.  Not  long  after,  he  resigned  and  took  his  seat  as  a  private 
member  of  the  House.  In  1869,  he  was  created  a  K.C.  of  Order  St.  Michael  and 
St.  George.  In  1872,  he  entered  into  private  life.  In  1880,  he  was  appointed  a  High 
Commissioner  for  Canada  at  the  Court  of  St.  James,  London,  with  a  salary  of 
$10,000  per  annum  and  a  residence,  and  he  resigned  from  this  in  1883.  Ever  since 
lie  has  remained  in  private  life,  but  perhaps  he  may  yet  be  induced  to  re-enter  public 
life  and  the  troublesome  arena  of  political  warfare.     Time  will  tell.

DOUGLAS  15RYMNEK. 

Thk  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  in  Greenock,  Scotland,  in  1823,  where  his  family 
had  been  long  and  favorably  known.  He  came  out  to  Canada  in  1857  ,  and  began  farm- 
ing in  the  Eastern  Townships,  at  Melbourne.  This  did  not  suit  the  ideas  and  feelings 
of  the  young  Scotsman.  The  proprietors  of  the  Montreal  Herald  (who  were  then 
Messrs.  Penny,  Wilson  &amp;  Stewart)  soon  found  him  out,  and  discovered  that  Douglas 
was  far  better  fitted  to  guide  a  pen  than  a  plough,  and  so  it  happened  that  he  was  shortly 
after  placed  on  the  staff  of  their  paper.  Mr.  Brymncr  was  then  appointed  editor  of  the 
Presbyterian.  This  was  then,  as  now,  the  mouthpiece  and  organ  of  the  Presbyterian 
Church  in  Canada.  He  continued  connected  with  this  j^aper  till  he  removed  to 
Ottawa,  where  Ik  was  appointed  Archivist  to  the  Dominion  Government.  Here  he  is 
in  his  native  element,  and  Canada  has  much  indeed  to  be  thankful  for  when  such  a 
man  undertakes  the  mighty  task  of  classifying,  arranging  and  docketing  her  archives 
and  records  of  the  past  two  hundred  years.  Whilst  the  work  lasts,  liis  annual  volume 
which  he  produces  shows  the  character  of  the  undertaking  and  the  laborious  nature 
of  the  charge.  Long  may  he  be  spared  so  that  all  the  remaining  records  be  also  as 
systematically  arranged.  The  result  of  his  investigations  into  these  old  records  has 
been  the  publicity  of  a  vast  amount  of  knowledge  which  otherwise  would  never  have 
been  known  to  the  public,  and  which  is  of  so  much  value  to  all  historians.

officer  of  (ieneral   Wolfe's  army  of  invasion.     Captain  Alexander  Ross  took  part  in 
the  l)atlle  on  the  I'lains  of  Ahr.ihani,  whicii  resulted   in  tlie  defeat  uf  the  French  and 
the  &lt;()ni|ucsl  of  all  Canada.     I  ic  snbseciueiitly  received  a  grant  oi  land  from  the  Crown 
and  settled  in  I'ruice  l'',dward  County,  Upper  (Janada,  where  he  lived  until  hisdeath, 
which   occurred    in    1S05.      Captain     Alexander    Ross  was  grandson    of  Alexander 
Ross,  laird  of  Halnagown,  Ross-shire  Scotland,  who  descended  in   a  direct  line  from 
Hugh  Ross,  of  iiarichcs,  second  son  of  Hugh,  tlie  sixth  and  last  ICarl  of  Ross,  of  the 
old  family.      I  )r.  Ross'  grandmother,  f)n   his    fathers  side,   was    Hannah    Prudence 
Williams,  a  descendant  of  Roger  Williams   |  i595-i&lt;&gt;H3),  the  f imous  liberal  preacher 
and  apostle  of  freedom,  (jf  Rlunle  Island.      His  mother,   Fiederika   (irant,  was  the 
youngest  daughter  of   |ohn(lr:iiil    of  liie  lirilisli  Army,   wlio  died  from  wounds  re-

fenks  has  left  a  famous  record  of  public  services.      He  was  Speaker  of  the  House  of 
R(;presentatives    of  Rhode  Island,  from    October,  iCajS  to  1708  ;    Deputy  (Iovernor 
from  May,  1715,  l&lt;&gt;  May,  1727  ;  (Governor  from  May,   1727,  to  May,  1732.     He  was 
a  staunch   ;ind   persistent  friend  and   advocate  of  political  and  religious  liberty.      In 
his  boyhood    Dr.    Ross  made  his  way  to   New    York  cily,  and  after  struggling  with 
many  adversities,  became  a  compositor  in  the  office  of  the  Evening  Post,  then  edited 
and  owned  by  William  Cullcn  P.ryant,  the  poet.     Mr.  JJryant  became  much  interested 
in  young  Ross,  and  ever  .ifier  remained  his  steadfast  friend.      It  was  during  this 
period  lie  became  acquainted  with  (leneral  (iaribaldi,  who  at  that  time  was  a  resident 
of  New  York,  and  employed  in  making  candles.     This  acquaintance  soon  ripened 
into  a  warm  friendship,  which  continued  unbroken  down  to  Garibaldi's  death  in  1882. 
It  was   through  Dr.  Ross'  efforts  in  1874  that  (iaribaldi  obtained  his  pension  from 
the  Italian  (Government.      In  1851,  Dr.  Ross  began  the  study  of  Medicine,  under  the 
direction  of  the  eminent  Dr.  Valentine  Mott,  and  subsequently  under  Dr.  Trail,  the 
celebrated  hygienic  physician.      After  four  years  of  unremitting  toil,  working  as  a 
compositor  during  the   day  ,  .1  I   studying  Medicine  at  night,  he  received  his  degree 
of  M.D.   in    1H55,    and    shortly   after  received  tlie  appointment  of    surgeon  in  the 
the  army   of    Nicaragua,     then    commanded    by    General  William    Walker.       He 
subsequently  became  actively  and  earnestly  engaged   in    the  anti-slavery   struggle 
in  the  United  States,  which  ciilmin.ited  in  the  liberation  from  bondage  of  four  mil- 
lions of  slaves.     Dr.    Ross  was  a  personal    friend  and  co-worker  of  Captain  John 
Brown,   the  martyr.     Although  Dr.  Ross'   sphere  of  labor  in  that  great  struggle  of 
human  freedom   was  less  public  than  that  of  many  others  in  the  cause,  it  was  not  less 
important,  and  rejuired  the  exercise  of  greater  caution,  courage  and  determination, 
and  also  involved  greater  personal  risks.     Senator  Wade,  Vice-President  of  the  United

The  sincere  radical  abolitionists,  with  whom  Dr.  Ross  was  laboring,  were  despised, 
hated  and  ostracised  by  the  rich,  the  powerful  ar.d  the  so-called  higher  classes  ;  but 
Dr,  Ross  always  possessed  the  courage  of  his  oi)inions,  and  prefers  the  ap])roval  of 
liis  own  conscienr(,'  to  the  smiles  or  favors  of  men.  Dining  tlu;  Southern  Rebellion 
he  was  employed  by  J'resident  Lincoln  as  confidential  correspondent  in  ("an;ida,  and 
rendered  very  imjjortant  services  to  the  LFnited  States  Government.  I'or  this  he  re- 
ceived the  special  thanks  of  President  lancoln  and  Secretary  Seward.  When  the 
war  ended,  with  the  downfall  of  the  Confederacy,  Dr.  Ross  offered  his  services  to 
rresident  Juarez,  of  Mexico,  and  received  the  ap])ointment  of  surgeon  in  the  ReiMib- 
lican  army.  'J'he  capliu'' of  Ataximillian,  and  the  speedy  overthrow  of  the  empire, 
rendered  Dr.  Ross'  services  unnecessary,  and  he  returned  to  Canada  and  to  the  con- 
genial and  more  peaceful  pursuits  of  a  naturalist.  The  object  of  his  ambition  was 
now  to  collect  and  classify  the  fauna  and  flora  of  his  native  country,  a  labor  never 
before  attenjpted  by  a  Canadian.  He  has  collected  and  classified  five  hundred  and 
seventy  species  of  Irirds  that  regularly  or  occasionally  visit  the  Dominion  of  Canada  ; 
two  hundred  and  forty  species  of  eggs  of  birds  that  breed  in  Canada  ;  two  hundred 
and  forty-seven  Hi)ecies  of  mammals,  reptiles,  and  fresh  water  fish  ;  three  thousand 
four  hundred  species  of  insects  ;  and  two  thousand  species  of  Canadian  flora.  Dr. 
Ross  has  been  a  member  of  the  British  Association  of  Science  for  the  last  twenty-one 
years,  and  of  the  French  and  American  Associations  for  the  past  seventeen  years. 
He  has  devoted  special  attention  to  the  ornithology,  ichthyology,  botany  and  ento-

opi^ressed,  no  matter  how  unpopular  the  cause  may  be.  He  does  his  duty  as  he  sees 
it,  regardless  of  conse([uences  to  himself.  When  Dr.  Ross  had  attained  his  fiftieth 
birthday,  he  was  the  recipient  of  many  tokens  of  regard  and  congratulations  from 
friends  and  co-workers,     i'lom  the  poet  Whittier  the  following  : —

on  the  prescriptions  which  are  prepared  in  his  establishment. 

The  ancestors  of  the  subject  of  this  sketch  have  lived  in  Wombv.'cll  for  over  eight 
himdred  years,  in  the  one  homestead  for  over  four  himdred  years,  and  they  have  been 
the  agents  of  .Sir  (leoige  Wombwcll  of  Wombwell  Hall  for  the  past  three  hundred 
years,  and  at  the  close  (jf  this  century  the  old  homestead  is  still  in  the  family. 

Mr.  JJirks  married  Mary  Morris  in  1848,  and  has  two  sons  and  two  daughters.

He  died  universally  regretted  by  all  who  knew  him. 

KKV.  KOMEKT  CAMPliKl.E,  D.D., 
Was  born  in  the 'J'ownship  of  Drummond,  Out.,  June  21st,  18,35.  His  i)arents  came 
to  Canada  in  1817  and  took  up  land  near  what  is  now  the  town  of  Perth.  Recollect 
what  Canada  was  in  those  da)3,  and  think  of  the  difficulty  of  the  subject  of  our  sketch 
getting  what  he  panted  for — education  beyond  what  the  common  schools  of  those  days 
afforded.  At  last  the  day  dawned,  andan  Irishman  wIk^  could  leach  a  liberal  education 
offered  his  services  for  the  school.  Thus  .Mr.  Cami)bell  eagerly  entered  the  arena  as  a 
studious  candidate.  So  determined  was  he,  that  one  hundred  lines  of  Virgil  at  one  sit- 
ting of  "  The  Dominie  "  was  n(,t  an  uncommon  occurrence.  After  a  few  years  of  such 
study  he  entered  Queen's  College,  Kingston,  with  Hying  colors,  and  graduated  J?  \.  in 
all  sul)jectsin  1856,  and  M.A.  in  1858.  Al'terwards  he  was  Head  Master  of  (^)ueen's 
College  Preparatory  School,  and  was,  in  the  autumn  of  1861,  ordained  Presbyterian 
minister  of  Gait.  Remaining  there  foi  five  years,  he  came  to  Montreal  in  1866, 
where  he  has  ever  since  been  the  well-known  and  much  res[)ected  minister  of  St. 
Gabriel  Church.  In  [863,  he  married  Margaret  McDonnell.  He  has  given  a  con- 
siderable amount  of  his  time  to  literary  work — being  connected  with  the  Preshyteriaii. 
In  1870,  he  was  given  the  prize  for  the  best  essay  on  the  Presbyterian  Union  in 
('anada.  His  great  work  in  the  literary  line  is  the  valuable  book  he  issued  a  few 
years  ago  on  St.  Gabriel  Church,  from  which  the  Author  of  this  work  acknowledges 
having  received  a  great  amount  of  information.  He  is  Chairman  of  the  Ministers' 
Widows'  and  Orphans'  Fund,  which  oflice  he  has  held  ever  since  the  death  of  the 
late  Dr.  Matheson.  He  is  also  a  rriember  of  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  Queen's 
University,  Kingston,  from  which — quite  unexpectedly — he  received  the  highest 
honor  a  clergyman  can  receive,  that  of  the  degree  of  D.D.  This  honor  was  conferred 
on  Dr.  Campbell  in  .'^pril,  1887,  and  if  any  man  deserved  recognition  from  the  hands 
of  his  college,  it  is  he.  He  is  still  in  the  prime  of  life,  a  great  curler — which, 
perhaps,  goes  to  prove  that  manly  exercises  arc  not  opposed  to  i)hysical  health  and 
clerical  virtues.  St.  Gabriel  ('hurch,  the  oldest  Presbyterian  Church  in  Montreal, 
was  sold  a  few  years  ago  to  the  Local  Government  for  Court  House  improvements, 
and  the  congregation  have  removed  to  St.  Catherine  street,  very  near  Phillips  Square, 
where  he  has  a  large  and  flourishing  congregation.

A  liiof.RArincAi,  sketch  printed  lilcvcn  years  agotluis  speaks  of  our  pre  sent  energetic 
I'rciniei  :  "  'I'lie  nieml)er  ot'tlie  (^iiebei:  Assembly  for  St.  Ily.irinthe  is  a  man  of  no 
)idiiiary  parts."  His  after  record  justifies  the  jjrophecy  of  the  writer  of  the  sketch 
in  tlie  year  iS.So,  as  found  in  [he  ''  Cii/hh/id/i  tVu\^ral^ki:(il  Dictionary  :''  "  He 
is  a  man  of  mark,  and  calcuhxted  by  Iiis  magnetic  power  to  exert  a  mighty  inlUience. 
'I'he  sid)sequent  years  of  his  career  fully  verify  this."  I'erhaps  no  man  in  this  prcstnt 
stage  of  the  History  of  Canada  has  been  more  honored  by  the  ecclesiastical  powers 
that  be,  none  more  spoken  of  '•  for  evil  and  fur  good  report,"  none  more  criticised, 
none  more  blamed  on  the  one  hand  and  lauded  on  the  other,  none  more  looked  up  to 
by  a  certain  portion  of  the  political  community,  and  none  more  looked  down  upon  by 
the  other,  none  more  successful  politically,  none  more  ennobled  by  him  who  rules  the 
spiritual  destinies  of  more  than  200  millions  of  the  itdiabilants  of  the  world,  none 
more  opposed  by  foes  on  the  one  hand,  and  none  more  upheld  by  friends  on  the 
other— than  the  subject  of  this  sketcIi^HoN'oKi';   Mi;kiii;i&lt;,   PrivMiiir  oi'   (,)i;i:iiKC. 

He  was  born  at  Iberville  on  the  15th  Octoboi-,  1S40.  He  received  a  first-class 
literary  education  at  the  Jesuit  College,  Montreal,  entering  the  college  at  the  early  age 
of  fourteen  years.  He  studied  Law  with  Mr  srs.  Laframboise  iV  I'apineau,  of  St. 
Hyacinthe,  and  was  admitted  to  the  Wwx  in  1S65.  Kven  in  his  younger  days  he 
engaged,  as  almost  all  our  young  r'rench  legal  and  medical  students  do,  in  literary 
pursuits.  '1  his  is  an  incentive  to  our  I'jiglish  stuilents.  My  experience  after  years 
in  Montreal  and  Canatla  shows  me  that  the  French  students  in  their  colleges,  ami 
when  studying  their  professions,  are  much  more  given  to  literary  pursuits  than  their 
English  confreres.  When  Mr.  Mercier  was  admitted  to  practice  he  then  dr&lt;jpped 
journalism  and  gave  his  whole  time  and  mind  to  the  duties  of  his  profession,  in  which 
he  soon  attained  to  the  first  rank  as  an  Advocate. 

In  1872,  he  was  returned  as  member  for  Rouville  to  the  House  of  Commons. 
In  1879,  he  was  elected  to  the  Legislative  Assembly,  as  the  Liberal  candidate,  to 
represent  St.  Hyacinthe,  and  became  Solicitor-General  in  the  Joly  Government,  and 
held  that  position  till  the  Cabinet  went  out  of  power  in  that  year. 

The  biogrr.phy  cpioted  above  thus  goes  on  to  s{)eak  of  Mr.  Mercier :  "  It  is 
almost  needless  to  say  that  Mr.  Mercier  has  lived  a  very  busy  life,  his  time  having 
been  divided  between  law  and  politics.  He  belongs  to  that  class  of  men  who  are 
always  ready  for  duty — always  fully  equij)i)cd  for  a  fight,  and  his  blows  never  fail  to 
be  felt.  His  friends  have  thought  that  at  times  his  political  contests  have  been  too 
fierce,  his  struggles  too  hard  for  his  health.  But  he  has  great  courage,  much  pluck, 
and  never  yields.  We  should  add  that  he  has  the  name  of  being  a  manly  fighter, 
never  taking  any  improper  advantage  of  his  adversary.  He  has  made  a  success  in 
whatever  he  has  undertaken." 

Let  us  then  follow  his  career  from  this  date,  1880,  to  the  present  time,  and  see 
whether  or  not  the  words  of  his  Biographer  then  are  now  verified.  He  continued  to 
lead  the  Loyal  Opposition  at  Quebec  till  the  fall  of  the  Taillon  Ministry  in  1887,

when  he  was  colled  on  to  form  a  Ministry,  which  he  did,  and  it  has  continued  ever 
since.  In  18S7,  the  General  injections  placed  Mr.  Mercier  at  the  licad  of  the 
Government,  being  returned  to  i)o\ver  witii  a  majority  of  over  twenty-five.  It  then 
behoved  iiim  to  do  wiiat  he  had  long  wished  to  do — settle  the  Jesuits'  claims.  This 
was  successfully  done,  and  by  the  i)ayment  of  $400,000  cash,  all  claims,  demands 
and  dues  of  the  Jesuits  against  the  Jiritisli  and  Colonial  Governments  were  finally 
and  for  ever  settled,  and  this  subject,  distracting  for  years,  has  at  last  by  his  intre- 
pidity been  laid  to  rest.  Many  reforms  have  accompanied  his  administration, 
Political,  Social,  Criminal  and  Civic:  and  let  iiis  enemies  say  what  they  will,  they 
must  all  conclude  lh?l  "  e.rceeding  much  benefit  has  accrued  to  the  Province  of 
Quebec  from  his  spirited  administration  of  its  affivirs."  In  a  book  of  siort  biographical 
sketches  like  this,  the  Author  eschews  as  mu(  h  politics  as  possible,  and  if  he  intro- 
duces such,  it  is  what  must  be  recorded  in  a  statistical  sketch  of  the  person  written 
about.  Tlie  following  are  ihe  principal  events  in  the  life  of  the  Premier  since  he 
accepted  power  in  1887.  Besides  liis  settlement  of  the  Jesuits'  Estates  he  has  been 
instrumental  in  expanding  the  development  of  the  country  by  railways,  railway 
bridges  and  other  public  works  ;  and  not  the  least  has  been  his  Bill  to  grant  to  each 
father  who  has  twelve  living  children  of  any  nationality  whatsoever,  the  gift  of  100 
acres  of  land  for  a  settlement  of  one  or  more  of  llie  family  on  the  homestead.  If  in  the 
old  Roman  Law  men  were  exempted  (who  had  just  married)  from  military  service  for 
a  year  after,  so  that  they  might  enjoy  the  pleasures  of  matrimony,  and  if  a  man  had 
seven  lining  children  he  was  free  from  taxation  ;  surely,  the  parents  wlio  have  given 
twelve  living  children  to  r.well  the  i)opulation  of  their  country  deserve  the  above 
grant  of  land.  It  is  pleasing  to  record  that  more  than  one  thousand  families  have 
applied  for  or  already  received  the  grant. 

At  the  commencement  of  the  Session  of  1883,  ^^^^  Hon.  Mr.  Joly  retired  from  the 
Leadership  of  the  Liberal  Party,  and  Mr.  Mercier  was  unanimously  elected  to  fill  his 
place;  and  during  his  administration,  whether  on  the  Treasury  Benciies  or  in 
Opposition,  all  must  maintain  that  he  has  fought  manfully,  successfully  and  spiritedly 
against  every  insinuation  of  maladministration  of  public  affairs  or  partiality  in  his 
official  career.  So  far  no  man  has  done  more  for  his  country  in  all  its  spheres  than 
Honore  Mercier  has  done,  the  Premier  of  Quebec.  He  has  ever  tried  to  do 
justice  impartially  to  majority  and  minority,  as  his  bitterest  enemies  must  admit ;  for 
instance,  in  the  Protestant  Insane  Hospital  at  V^erdun,  Montreal.  He  has  been 
most  generous  and  fair  in  his  dealings  with  that  Institution,  and  without  him  it  never 
would  have  existed. 

In  a  volume  lately  published  by  M.  Pelland,  Advocate,  of  Montreal,  and  called 
"  T/ie  Biography  and  Speeches  of  the  Hon.  Honore  Mercier,^'  there  are  some  very 
fine  flights  of  rhetoric,  which  might,  as  some  parts  of  our  best  French  and  English 
Divines,  Lawyers  and  Statesmen's  speeches,  be  adopted  as  recitation  or  reading 
lessons  for  the  higher  classes  in  our  colleges  and  schools. 

The  first  of  these  quotations  refers  to  the  time  when,  in  the  Autumn  of  1880,  a 


MADAMK  MHRCIKR.

report  was  in  circuhilioii  that  he  was  in  favor  of  a  Coalition  Ministry,  and  tlial  he 
would  accept  a  portfolio  in  tlic  Conservative  I'ahinet  ai  (Quebec,  of  which  lion.  Mr. 
Cliaplean  was  then  the  Premier.  In  a  speecii  at  St.  Hyacinthe  he  set  himself  right 
before  the  public,  and  we  call  the  attention  of  our  readers  to  the  nobleness  of  the 
sentiments  tlierein  contained. 

In  a  speech  delivered  before  His  Kxcellcncy  the  \rar(iuis  of  Lome  on 
"  I'airiotisni,"  he  displayed  a  remarkable  flow  of  language  and  senlnnents  that 
redounded  to  his  credit  and  called  fo.th  pl.iudits  of  admiration. 

In  this  sketch  we  have  saitl  nothing  of  the  higii  honors  which  have  been  placed 
upon  him.  He  is  a  Count  of  the  Holy  Roman  l^mpire,  and  wears  mure  thai  one 
decoration  from  European  Powers.  The  Pope  himself  has  conferred  on  him  marked 
gifts,  and  this  may,  perhaps,  have  stirred  the  spleen  in  certain  bosoms  whi&lt;h  have 
made  his  enemies  so  bitter  in  some  (piarters  against  him.  lie  that  as  it  may,  Canada 
has  produced  some  men  of  mark  which  is  the  more  remarkable  in  so  young  a 
country.  If  .Sir  John  A.  .Macdonald  stands  conspicuously  out  (a  native  of  Scotland) 
as  the  helmsman  of  Canada,  so  Sir  George  K.  Cartier  in  the  Province  of  Quebec  ;  and 
if  among  the  Premiers  that  have  been,  or  are,  in  this  Dominion,  Sir  John  holds  the 
first  rank,  surely  the  subject  of  our  sketch  as  a  Premier  holds  no  insignificant  place. 
This  may  displease  some,  nevertheless  I  close  with  Pilate's  address  to  the  Jews, 
"  ll^/i(i(  I  have  written,  I  have  tvritten." 

Smce  the  above  sketch  was  written  a  great  change  has  taken  place  in  the  Govern- 
ment of  Quebec.  The  Ministers  possessing  a  majority  of  twenty-five  votes  in  the 
Legislative  Assembly  of  the  People  have  been  dismissed.  On  the  21st  December 
last,  the  Lieut.  Governor  of  the  Province  did  so,  and  immediately  after  ordered  the 
formation  of  a  new  Ministry.  The  Assembly  was  also  dissolved  and  new  general 
elections  gazetted  for  the  8th  of  March.  . 

Hon.  Mr.  Mercier  married  on  the  29th  May,  1866,  Lcopoldine  Boivin  of  St. 
Hyacinthe.  She  died  a  year  or  two  after.  On  the  9th  of  May,  187 1,  he  married 
again  a  lady  of  St.  Hyacinthe,  Virginie  St.  Denis.  A  fine  portrait  of  her  is  found  in 
this  G.\ZErTfc:h:R.     O.ie  of  th-'ir  chiliren  is  the  wif^;  of  Mr.  Gouin,  advocate.

ARTHUR  IMNSKRKAU. 

Oni:  of  our  most  promiiifnt  men  of  letters  in  Canada.  He  was  horn  July  5,  i&lt;S44, 
at  Contrecieur.  Some  well-known  men  have  been  horn  there,  such  as  Mgr.  Duhamel, 
Archbishop  of  Ottawa,  and  the  late  Senator  Holland.  His  father  was  Clement 
Dansereau,  and  his  mother  Louise  I'iset.  Arthur  was  the  eldest  son.  He  was  sent 
to  Vercheres  College  first,  then  to  that  of  J/Assoniption,  where  he  passed  a  brilliant 
career.  He  arrived  in  Monucal,  September,  1.S62,  and  j)resenled  himself  to  Sir 
Cieorge  Cartier,  a  friend  of  his  father,  anil  asked  him  where  he  should  go.  IJeing 
advised  to  be  a  student  with  Mr.  (iirouard,  he  entered  that  gentleman's  oft'ice,  and 
for  three  years  was  a  diligent  student  of  I,aw.  Afterwards  he  entered  McGill  College, 
and  from  that  Institution  received  his  ]J.C.L,  and  in  1S65  was  admitted  to  the  IJar. 
He  did  not  go  on  with  his  profession,  but  chose  literature  and  entered  the  office  of 
Jai  Minerve.  In  1S70,  he  became  one  of  its  proprietors.  In  1880,  he  retired.  Hur- 
ing  the  years  between  the  above  date  and  this  year,  Mr.  Dansereau  employed  him- 
self in  literature  and  other  congenial  occupations,  and  on  the  ist  February,  1S92,  he 
was  appointed  Tost  Master  of  Montreal,  on  the  retiring  v.di  a  pension  of  Mr. 
I;amothe.  During  the  sliort  time  .Nfr.  Dansereau  has  been  in  office,  he  has  i)rovcd 
himself  both  a  courteous  and  capable  head  of  this  important  deparlnioiit.  The 
whole  internal  economy  of  the  Post  Office  has  been  improved,  and  Mr.  Dansereau 
bids  fair  to  be  as  popular  a  I'ost  Master  as  any  who  have  gone  before,  as  he  pos- 
sesses energy  and  patience,  two  gifts  especially  necessary  in  the  right  performance 
of  such  an  onerous  and  public  position. 

DKSIRE  GIROUARD,  M.r., 

Was  born  at  St.  Timothy,  in  the  County  of  Beauharnois,  7th  July,  1826.  After 
finishing  his  preliminary  studies,  he  entered  the  Montreal  College,  and  passed  with 
eclat  through  all  his  studies  and  classes.  He  then  entered  the  Law  office  of  Edward 
Carter,  Esq.,  Q.C.,  and  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  on  the  ist  October,  i860.  Mr. 
Girouard  is  one  of  our  most  important  Law  writers.  In  i860,  he  published  a  work 
entitled,  "  Essai  sur  les  lettres  de  change  et  sur  les  billets  promissoires."  The 
importance  of  the  subject,  the  diffusion  and  obscurity  of  our  laws  at  this  epoch  upon 
this  matter,  rendered  the  work  of  Mr.  Girouard  of  the  greatest  utility.  Th&gt;a  intro- 
duction, which  contains  the  historical  part,  is  treated  in  a  most  lucid  manner. 

In  1868,  he  published  another  work  entitled,  "Considerations  sur  les  loisciviles 
du  mariage."    This  work  first  appeared  in  the  columns  of  the  Nouveau  Monde. 

In  1869,  he  printed  the  "Etude  sur  I'Acte  Concernant  la  Faillite."  "  M. 
Girouard  exprime  le  regret  de  voir  de  si  notables  alterations  s'op6rer  dans  notre  droit, 
et  compliquer  dans  une  certaine  mesure  le  fonctionnement,  des  rdgles  courtes  et 
simples  du  droit  commun  de  nos  lois  statutaires.  Cette  brochure  se  recommande 
par  des  commentaires  et  des  discussions  utiles.  Elle  est  divis6e  en  dix-sept  chapitres 
et  subdivisee  en  cent  un  paragraphes.  L'auteur  fait  preuve  des  connaissances  sur 
ce  sujet,  mais  la  phraseologie  est  loin  d'Otre  irreprochable." 


r.AZKTTKKR    OF    MOiNTRKAI,.  165 

In  the  work  which  Mr.  Clirouard  puhhshed  on  marriage,  taken  from  a  notice  in 
a  recent  Krencli  work,  he  divides  his  part  on  Catholic  marriages  into  four  sections, 
viz.:  1st.  "  I'ai  face  de  I'l'lgMse;  2nd.  I'ar  le  propre  cure  des  parlies;  ^^rd.  Apres 
pul)Hcation  on  dispense  des  bancs  ;  4lh.  iCnfm,  il  nc  doit  exister  aucun  empeche- 
mcnt  non  disjjense  par  leur  eveque." 

In  the  Protestant  marriages  it  is  thus  divided: — "  l,e  mariagc  des  Protestants 
doit  aussi  etre  celehre  par  leur  propre  ministre;  ii  doit  etre  celelre  publiquenient 
apres  publication  de  bancs,  suivant  les  usages  de  chaque  congregation  ;  unc  licence 
de  mariage  dispense  de  toutes  ces  formalites,  il  suftlt  alors  (|u'il  soit  celebre  par  le 
minisire  des  parlies,  sans  autre  forme." 

He  promoted  and  carried,  during  the  session  of  1S82,  the  l&gt;il!  authorizing  mar- 
riage with  a  deceased  wife's  sister. 

Mr.  (lirouard  has  contributed  a  great  deal  to  tlie  columns  of  the  Revue  Criti(/tie, 
in  which  he  writes  in  the  English  language.  These  writings  on  the  reports  of  the 
Church  and  State  show  much  work,  much  research  and  a  great  love  of  study. 

He  has  held  the  position  of  one  of  the  members  of  the  Counsel  of  the  Montreal 
Bar,  and  has  always  maintained  a  high  position  in  the  city  as  an  intelligent  and  well 
instructed  advocate;  hence  he  has  often  been  retained  in  some  of  the  niosl  important 
law  suits  which  have  a|)peared  before  the  Court  for  the  [)asi  years. 

His  Parliamentary  career  miy  be  thus  summed  up.  He  was  first  returned  to 
Parliament  for  the  present  seat  at  the  General  Elections  of  rSyS.  Was  an  unsuccess- 
ful candidate  for  Beauharnois  at  the  elections  of  1874.  He  was  re-elected  for  Jacfjues 
Cartierin  1882,.  and  also  at  the  last  Ceneral  I'^lections.  J5esides  the  carrying  through 
of  the  above  very  important  Bill,  he  has  been  Cliairman  of  many  imi)ortant 
Committees  in  the  House. 

Mr.  Girouard  first  married  the  daughter  of  the  well-known  and  much  respected 
citizen,  John  Pratt,  Esq.  This  lady  having  died,  he  again  married  an  American  lady, 
Essie  Granwell,  of  New  Orleans ;  his  third  consort  is  I'^dith  B.,  daughter  of  J. 
Beatty,  M.D.,  of  Cobourg,  and  has  an  interesting  family. 

SIR  HUGH  ALLAN 

Was  born  at  Saltcoats,  in  the  County  of  Ayr,  Scotland,  on  the  2gth  September, 
1810.  He  was  the  second  son  of  the  late  Captain  Allan;  who  was  long  and  favorably 
known  as  a  lighly  jjojjular  shipmaster,  trading  between  the  Clyde  and  Montreal. 
During  the  thirty  years  he  was  engaged  \\\  that  business,  the  different  ships  he  com- 
manded were  much  sought  after  by  passengers  ;  and  several  persons  still  living 
throughout  the  Province  retain  to  this  day  pleasant  reminiscences  of  the  voyages 
which  they  made  across  the  Atlantic  under  his  watchful  care. 

Sir  Hugh  sailed  from  Greenock  for  Montreal,  on  the  12th  of  April,  1826,  in  the 
hng  Favorite,  of  which  his  father  v.. is  then  commander,  and  his  eldest  brother  second 
officer.  Arriving  in  Montreal  he  fiUca  m  engagement  in  the  establishment  of  Wm. 
Kerr  &amp;  Co.  After  this  he  travelled  for  some  time  in  the  United  States,  and  re. 
visited  Scotland,  where  he  remained  one  year,  and  returned  to  Montreal. 


lf&gt;()  r.AZKTTKKR  OK  MONTPKAL. 

Having  decided  to  make  ii  Iiis  liome  he  entered  the  fiini  of  J.  Millar  iS:  Co.. 
shipbuilders  and  shipix.'rs,  and  thus  had  ample  scope  in  the  display  of  his  .icciuircd 
knowledge.  So  well  did  he  ac(piil  himself,  that  after  the  short  period  f)f  four  years 
he  was  admitted  as  a  jiartner  of  the  firm.  In  the  year  i,S,?8  Mr.  Miller  died,  and 
the  husiness  was  thereafter  conducted  by  I'.dmonstone  vV  Allan,  which  firm,  through 
various  mutations  of  title,  and  vastly  iiicieased  business  relations,  is  still  continued 
under  the  title  of  H.  \-  A.  Allan, 

In  i837-.^8  .Sir  Hugh  served  as  (^ajitain  in  the  Volunteers.  He  was  President 
of  the  Montreal  Telegraph  Company,  of  the  Canadian  Navigation  ("oinpany,  the 
Merchants'  Hank  of  Canada,  Lake  Meni|)hrcn)agog  Navigation  Company,  the  Mul- 
grave  (lold  Mining  Company,  Montreal  Warehousing  Company,  \'ermont  and 
Canada  i\[arble  Company,  besides  a  great  number  of  other  industries  and  comjianies. 
Indeed  no  man  in  the  Dominion  of  Canada  deserved  public  lecognition  like  Sir 
Hugh  Allan,  and  therefore  Her  .Most  (iracious  Mi'jesly  the  (Jueni  on  her  ])art 
acknowledged  his  past  sevvices  by  Knighting  him  with  her  own  hand,  and  theieby 
])roving  thai  indomitable  perseverance  and  continued  industry  will  ultimately 
and  always  succeed.     He  died  some  years  ago. 

A.NDRLW  ALLAN, 

Tifi;  brother  of  Sir  Hugh,  and  the  third  of  the  four  sons  of  the  late  Captain  .V. 
Allan,  was  also  born  at  Saltcoats,  Ayrshire,  Scoiland,  on  the  ist  l)eceml)er,  1822. 
On  compleu'ng  his  education  he  came  to  Montreal,  and  entered  into  business  in  the 
firms  with  which  his  elder  brother  was  connected,  and  he  continued  throughout  to  be 
an  energetic  and  i'xlustrious  sujjporter  of  all  the  commercial  enterprises  in  which  Sir 
Hugh  has  been  engaged.  He  married  a  daughter  of  the  late  Mr.  John  Smith  and  sister 
to  Lady  Allan.  Mr.  Allan  is  President  or  \'ice-President  of  many  of  our  most  enter- 
prising conii)anies,  ever  ready  to  lend  his  hand  and  means  to  the  advancement  of 
Montreal  and  everything  connected  with  its  development.  We  feel  pleasure  in 
appending  the  foil  &gt;ving  record,  from  a  liiverpool  paper  of  the  Allan  Line  of  Steam- 
ers, as  an  honor  to  these  gentlemen  and  to  Montreal  itself: — 

"  As  an  instance  of  the  great  development  of  the  Canadian  trade,  we  may 
remark  that  up  to  the  year  1S40,  about  a  dozen  sailing  vessels  of  from  four  to  five 
hundred  tons  register  were  sufficient  to  conduct  all  the  trade  that  then  existed. 
Now  the  Allan  Company  alone  possess  twenty-one  first-class  steamers,  with  a  gross 
tonnage  of  56,000  tons,  the  bulk  of  which  are  engaged  in  the  Canadian  trade. 
From  the  year  1840  to  1S50,  the  sailing  tleet  of  the  Allan  Company  was  increased 
according  to  the  advance  of  the  Canadian  trade,  the  requirements  of  which  were 
attentively  watched  by  the  late  Mr.  Jiryce  Allan,  Mr.  Alexander  Allan,  Mr.  Andrew 
Allan,  and  the  late  Sir  Hugh  Allan.  Nearly  all  the  CajHains  in  the  service  have 
been,  literally  speaking,  born  in  it,  and  consequently  have  a  thorough  knowledge 
of  the  trade.

of  the  conntiy,  by  railways,  canals,  and  the  establishment  of  a  more  regul.ir  and 
rapid  connnnnication  with  the  mother  country.  'I'he  enormous  stream  of  emi- 
gration whi(  h  was  then  ll  )wing  from  the  old  to  the  new  world  attracted  their  atten- 
tion, ami  to  some  extent  nilurally  .iroiis;,'d  their  jealousy.  Th'-y  were  nnt  the 
meii  to  rest  rjuietly  on  their  o  irs  without  making  any  attempt  to  discover  whether 
there  wiMe  not  hundreds  and  thousands  of  Kngli^hmen,  Irishmen  and  Scotchmen 
who.  while  they  were  desirous  to  emigrate,  looked  with  more  favor  on  the  United 
Slates  than  Canada.  ll  was,  therefoie,  against  many  and  dif^'icull  obstacles  that 
Messrs.  .Allan  established  a  line  of  steamships  to  promote  and  accommodate  the 
growing  trade  between  (Ireat  liritain  and  the  Dominion  of  Canada,  and  also  for  the 
])urposc  of  carrying  the  mails.  At  this  period  the  sailing  lleet  of  the  Allan  Company 
numbered  I'liteen  vessels  ;  but  in  the  year  1S53  two  hue  iron  screw  steamships  were 
added  t  j  the  lleet.  'I'liese  were  llie  Indian  and  the  Canadian  of  1,500  tons  register, 
and  230  nominal  horse-p  :wer  each.  'I'hesf  vessi.'ls  were  intended  to  trade  regularly 
l)etween  Liverpool  and  (Quebec  and  Montreal.  In  the  bi'ginning  of  1857,  the  fleet 
having  been  increased  by  the  steamers  North  American  and  Anglo-Saxon,  the  .Mian 
Company  enteretl  into  arrangements  with  the  Canadian  (iovernment  for  a  fort- 
nightly service  of  mail  steamers  between  Liverpool  and  (Quebec  in  the  summer,  and 
Portland  (Maine)  in  the  winter  months  ;  and  since  that  ilate  the  Comjjany  has 
carried  the  Canadian  mails  under  contract  with  the  (lovernment  of  Canada.  In 
1859,  however,  the  origuial  contract  was  extended  to  a  weekly  instead  of  a  fortnightly 
.sailing,  which  continues  u[)  to  the  present  dale — the  steamers  leaving  Liverpool 
every  Thursday,  calling  ai  Moville  on  the  following  day  for  the  supplementary 
IJrilish  mails.  In  addition  lo  this  service,  the  Allan  Company  a  few  yea.s  ago 
entered  into  a  fresh  contract  with  the  Canadian  (lovernment  ibr  the  carriage  of  the 
mails  between  Liverpool  and  Halifax,  Nova  Scotia;  and  St.  Jcjhn's,  Newfoundland. 
In  1859  the  trade  between  Liverpool  and  Canada  had  so  far  increased  that  the 
Messrs.  Allan  were  obliged  to  add  fr)ur  new  steamers  to  their  lleet;  and  from  that 
year  u\)  to  the  present  time  their  line  of  steamships  iias  increased  until  it  stands  at 
its  present  strength.  In  connection  with  the  construction  of  their  steamers  we  may 
slate  that  Messrs.  Allan  were  the  first  Company  to  adopt  t!ie  spar  or  Hush  deck  to  their 
steamers,  and  in  doing  this  ihey  were  opposed  strongly  by  the  I&gt;oard  of  Trade,  who 
would  not  allow  them  any  concession  in  the  way  of  measurement  for  harbor  clues, 
etc.,  and  thus  put  them  at  the  great  disadvantage  of  placing  su])erior  ships  at  an 
extra  cost  upon  the  transatlantic  line  of  traffic,  without  the  slightest  recognition  of 
the  circumstances  in  their  favor.  lUit  when  the  unfortunate  London  went  down  in 
the  Bay  of  Biscay  the  death-knell  of  the  open  deck  system  was  tolled,  and  the  Board 
of  Trade  itself  was  literally  *  pooped,'  and  it   was  compelled  by  the  inexorable  logic

In  reading  the  second  division  or  part  of  the  History  of  Canada,  we  perceive  a  figure 
who  stands  forth  as  the  glorious  defender  of  our  rights.  This  figure,  this  type,  this  old 
patriot  is  Du  Calvet.  He  was  arrested  27111  .September,  i7eSo,  over  110  years  ago, 
because  of  his  liberal  ideas,  and  was  cominilled  lo  prison  by  the  order  of  Governor 
Haldimand.  There  he  was  de[)rived  of  his  papers  and  his  money.  Aft^r  his  libera- 
tion he  went  to  I*aigland  to  demand  justice  from  King  G(iorge,  and  there  requested 
that  Haldimand  be  brought  to  London  that  he  mighl  be  accused  before  an  English 
tribunal.  There  was  no  attention  paid  Lo  his  request.  He,  however,  published  a 
volume  of  letters,  which  Carneau  declares  to  be  written  in  a  style  showing  a  tiery 
and  independent  spirit.  His  works  were  printed  in  London  in  1784.  He  was  one 
of  the  first  Justices  of  the  Peace  in  the  City  of  Montreal.  His  work  treats  of  Cana- 
dian History  between  the  years   1774  and  1791.

Th:.  Prime  Minister  of  tlie  Province  of  Quebec,  conies  of  an  old  and  most  dis-

dred  years  have  played  no  unimportant  part  in  the  history  of  Canada.  The  first 
known  of  the  family  in  Canadian  annals  was  Lieutenant-Cieneral  Pierre  lioucher, 
Sieur  de  (Irosbois,  who  was  Governor  of  Tlirce  Rivers  in  1653,  and  tlie  founder  of 
the  Seigniory  of  Houciierville.  He  was  a  man  of  great  distinction  and  influence  in 
his  day.  The  fither  of  the  Premier  was  also  one  of  Canada's  able  legislators,  being 
one  of  tiie  Legislative  Council  t'or  Lower  Canada  for  many  years. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  at  the  family  seat,  Houchervilie,  in  1820.   He 
was  educated  at  the  St.  Sulpice  College  in  this  city,  and  subsequently  went  to  Paris  to 
finish  Iiis  medical  studies,   and  graduated  with  the  Iiighest  honors  in  his  profession. 
IL;  did  not  enter  ])()lilical  life  before    1S61,    when   he   was  elected  to  the  House  of 
Assembly  fi)r  the  County  of  Cliambly,  which   he  continued  to  represent  until  1S67, 
when  he  was  appointed  a  Legislative  Councillor  of  (J;uebec  Province,  and  became  a 
member  of  the  Chauveau  Ministry,  with  the  office  of  President  of  the  Council,  which 
oflice  he  held  until  1S73.     On   the   reconstruction  of  the  Cabinet  on  September  2, 
1S74,  he   was   entrusted  with   the   formation   of  a   Ministry.     This  he    successfully 
accomplished,  taking  for  iiimself  tiie  portfolio  of  Secretary  and  Registrar  and  Minis- 
ter of  Public  Instruction.     In  1876,  he  changed  his  portfolio  for  that  of  Agriculture 
and  Public  Works.     J'^arly  in  ^Larch,  1878,  the  De  Boucherville  Ministry  were  sud- 
denly dismissed   from  office   by   the  late    Lieut.  Governor  Letellier  de  St.  Just  on 
alleged  charges  of  extravagance  and  of  giving  way  to   undue  influence  of  railway 
*'  rings  "  of  supporters  in  the  House  and  their  friends,  contractors,  etc.  These  reasons 
appeared  sufficient  for  the  Lieut.  Governor  to  dismiss  them,  and  with  very  little  time 
or  ceremony  they  were  put  out  of  power.     Mr.  De  IJoucherville,  feeling  that  fair  play 
had  not   been  meted   out  to  him,   refused  to  name  a   successor,  and  thereupon  Mr. 
Letellier  sent  for  Hon.  Mr.  Joly  de  Lotbiniere  and   invited  him  to  form  a  Ministry, 
which  he  did.    One  of  his  contemporaries  was  Hon.  Honore  Mercier,  now  dismissed 
in  turn  by  Governor  Angers,  who  was  then  a  colleague  of  Mr.  De  Boucherville  and 
Attorney  General.      In  October,   1S79,   the  Joly  Ministry  was  defeated,  and  Mr. 
Chapleau  came  back  to  power  with  the   Conservatives  and  as  Premier,  but  Mr.  De 
Boucherville  did  not  enter  the  Cabinet,  having  accomplished  all  he  wanted  in  driv- 
ing his  opponents  from  office.     In  1879,  he  was  called  to  the  Senate  of  Canada.  He 
was  married  twice,  his  second  wife  being   Mile   C.  Lussier  of  Varennes,  who  died  a 
few  days  ago.     Last    December   he  was  called  on  to   form  a  new  Ministry  on  the 
dismissal  of  the  Mercier  Cabinet,  which  he  did,  and  the  result  of  the   Elections  of 
tlie  8th  of  March  last  has  replaced  him  in  power  with  an  overwhelming  majority.

KOlfKRT  ARMOUR. 

Thkre  were  three  brothers,  Rol)ert,  Hugh  and  Shaw — all  born  in  Kilnia'-nock,  Scot- 
land. Robert,  the  eldest,  came  to  Canada  in  1798.  lie  commenced  business  in 
Montreal,  and  soon  became  the  head  of  t'.j  firm  of  ''  R.  Armour  i\:  Co."  in  1S17,  his 
name  occurs  as  the  senior  partner  of  the  firm  of  Robert  Armour  \',  Davis.  Robert, 
his  son,  died  in  Montreal,  1S59.  He  had  been  the  first  partner  in  the  old  and  well- 
known  i)ublishing  firm  of  "  Armour  vs:  Ramsay."  They  had  owned  the  Gazette  for 
many  years.  His  uncles,  Hugh  and  Shaw  Armour,  had  come  to  Canada  a  few  years 
after  their  brother  Robert.  Hugh  died  in  icS22  at  St.  Therese,  and  Shaw  removed 
to  Upper  Canada  in  1S20,  where  his  descendants  are  found  at  the  present  day. 

IIHW  RAMSAY. 

Hkw  Ramsay  was  well  known  in  Montreal  thirty-five  years  ago.  He  was  a  pub- 
lisher with  Armour.  He  married  Agnes  Hunter,  and  then  resided  at  a  fine  suburban 
residence  at  the  Tanneries  called  *'  The  Glen,"  where  he  died  some  years  ago.  Their 
son,  the  late  advocate,  Robert  A.  Ramsay,  was  a  brilliant  youth,  and  at  his  death 
was  universally  lamented.  He  had  passed  most  successfully  through  McCill  High 
Scho;&gt;l  and  the  University,  and  was  one  of  the  Fellows  when  he  died.  Mrs.  H. 
Ramsay  died  not  long  since. 

JOHN  FISHER 

Wa.s  born  in  Montreal  in  1788,  thus  his  family  must  have  been  among  the  earliest 
in  the  city.  When  he  grew  up,  his  business  was  known  as  that  of  *'  Daniel  \:  John 
Fisher,"  grocers  and  dry  goods  merchants — or  what  was  in  those  early  days  "  a 
general  store,"  as  seen  in  the  country  at  the  })resent  day.  In  Ocober,  182 1,  he 
married  Miss  Hunter  of  Quebec.  She  was  one  of  the  handsomest  women  of  her 
times,  and  the  writer  well  remembers  her,  between  forty  and  fifty  years  ago,  as  such, 
with  her  daughters.  They  lived  then  in  St.  Antoine  street.  He  represented  Montreal 
West  in  the  Provincial  Parliament  from  1830  to  1834.  After  an  eventful  life  he  died 
in  Montreal. 

EUSTACHK  PRUDHOMME  . 

Was  a  Notary  of  Montreal,  being  born  there,  and  studied  in  that  city.  His  poetry 
is  most  descriptive,  and  for  the  most  pait  published  in  the  Revue  Canadienne.  In 
the  one  "  Mon  Village  "  the  author  shows  an  immense  amount  of  vivacity.  His 
best  poem  is  "  Les  Martyrs  de  la  Foi  en  Canada."  For  this  work  he  obtained  the 
silver  medal  in  the  Congress  of  Poesy,  in  1868.  He  was  also  honorably  mentioned 
in  that  of  1867  for  his  poem  of  "  La  d^couverte  du  Canada."      .       .,      ,,  .

DAVIIJ  MORUICE. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  in  Penh,  Scuthmd.  His  was  a  home  where 
i;arcful  Christian  advantages  of  teaching  were  seen  in  everything.  Me  attended  tiie 
Higli  Scliool  of  his  native  city,  and  received  there  a  thorougli  secular  and  &lt;oninicr- 
cial  education.  Afterwards  he  entered  business  in  Perth,  but  shortly  after  went  to 
Ireland,  remaining  a  sliorl  time  in  the  cities  of  Dublin  and  Cork.  Thence  he  went  to 
England,  and  resided  chiefly  in  London,  Liverpool  and  Manchester  —  the  great 
nianufacturing  and  exporting  cities  of  IJritain.  In  all  these  places  he  was  receiving 
that  knowledge  and  experience  which  has  l)een  turned  to  so  good  account  in  this 
country.  When  he  was  twenty-three  years  of  age,  he  left  England  and  arrived  in 
Montreal  in  1X55.  Remaining  a  short  time  there  he  went  to  Toronto  where  he  lived 
for  some  time,  being  employed  by  a  large  wholesale  establishment  in  that  city.  In 
1S63,  Mr.  Morrice  removed  to  Montreal,  and  began  to  build  up  the  immense  busi- 
ness now  managed  by  him  and  his  scmis.  As  general  merchants  and  mamifaclurers' 
agents,  they  carry  on  the  largest  business  of  their  line  in  the  Dominion.  They  have 
large  warehouses  in  .Montreal  and  Toronto,  and  control  over  forty  cotton  and  woollen 
mills  throughout  the  country. 

On  the  arrival  of  Mr.  Morrice  in  Montreal,  he  attended  Colte  .Stree;  Church, 
where  Rev.  Dr.  MacVicar  was  the  Minister,  and  the  late  Hon.  Justice  Torrance  the 
Sunday  School  Superintendent.  On  the  retirement  of  the  latter  from  his  duties, 
Mr.  Morrice  was  elected  Superintendent,  and  has  now  been  for  a  quarter  of  a  cen- 
tury the  efficient  and  beloved  head  of  the  large  Sunday  School  in  connection  with 
the  church. 

In  1876-77,  he  was  an  active  worker  and  a  generous  donor  to  Crescent  Street 
Church,  which  was  erected  when  the  old  building  in  Cotte  street  was  sold.  But  the 
work  by  which  he  is  most  widely  known,  and  by  which  his  name  will  be  perpetuated 
to  distant  generations,  is  part  of  the  Presbyterian  College  of  Montreal,  or  as  it  is 
better  known  by  the  name  of  "  David  Morrice  Hall."  This  cost  the  large  sum  of 
$So,ooo,  and  was  opened  with  great  rejoicings  on  28th  November,  1882.  This  was 
the  beginning  of  other  substantial  donations  to  the  College  since.  He  has  been  a 
liberal  giver  to  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association,  the  General  Hospital,  the 
Sailors'  Institute,  the  House  of  Refuge,  etc. 

In  June,  1881,  he  married  Anne  S.  Anderson,  of  Toronto,  a  lady  who  has 
admirably  helped  him  and  seconded  all  his  undertakings — a  true  helpmeet  to  him. 
He  has  seven  sons  and  one  daughter.  His  two  eldest  sons  are  now  members  of  the 
firm,  and  another  is  practising  Law.  He  is  a  member  of  various  societies,  the  chief 
being  the  Microscopic  Club,  and  for  many  years  a  Director  of  the  large  cotton  mills 
in  the  East  End  of  the  City-  In  conclusion  I  may  quote  from  a  former  writer,  who 
says  :  "  In  combining  Christian  effort,  and  in  freely  and  wisely  dispensing  his  bounty 
during  his  own  lifetime,  he  has  set  an  example  which  our  merchant  princes  and 
wealthy  men  generally  would  do  well  to  follow."

in  i8ig,  and  from  that  period  was  a  citizen  of  Montreal.  Coming  from  thegreat  linen 
districts  of  Ireland,  Mr.  Murphy's  store  was  always  a  great  rendezvous  for  all  kinds 
of  Irish  linen,  etc.  He  commenced  business  in  1819,  the  year  of  his  arrival,  in 
Notre  Dame  Street,  and  retired  in  1S60.  'I'hc  business  was  carried  on  in  the  same 
store  where  Mr.  Murphy  had  been  so  long  and  well  known  by  his  two  sons,  Alexan- 
der and  John,  under  the  title  of  Murphy  Brothers.  After  some  years  they  dissolved 
partnership.  John,  the  younger  son,  is  at  this  day  one  of  tiie  largest  dry  goods 
merchants  in  the  city,  his  extensive  premises  being  about  opposite  the  place  where 
his  father  did  business  for  over  fifty  years. 

Of  his  daughters,  one  married  George  Childs,  merchant;  another  Dr.  Uowlby,

Hk  came  from  the  North  of  Ireland,  ilis  family  occnpicd  a  high  soc  i;d  pusition  m 
Montreal.  His  sons  seem  to  have  been  hot-blooded  youths.  ( &gt;ne  of  them,  a  lawyer 
by  profession,  had  a  dnel  with  a  person  named  js.  Seoti,  who.  altlioii_t;h  a  novice,  slior 
Sweeny  in  the  leg.  IVc-vioiis  to  this  he  had  liad  an  affa  r  of  honor  with  the  (  elel)rali. d 
Walker,  also  a  brother  lawyer,  when  lu*  shot  Mr.  W'alkei  in  the  hand,  thereby 
destroying  one  of  his  hngers. 

The  eVv'iil  of  the  family  was  the  tragedy  in  which  Robert  Sweeny  had  a  mis- 
understanding with  a  Major  Ward  of  the  '"  Royals,"  then  quartered  iii  Montreal.  He 
was,  like  his  brother,  a  lawyer,  and  the  (piariel  arose  about  Sf)ine  foolish  nonsense 
connected  with  his  wife,  who  afterwards  as  a  widow  married  the  late  Sir  John  Rose, 
Hart.  Having  sent  a  challenge  lo  Major  Ward,  they  met  May  22n(l,  1.S38,  ami 
Sweeny,  who  had  an  unerring  aim,  shot  his  f)pponeiit  dead.  The  witnesses  or  the 
seconds  with  Sweeny  immediately  tied  to  the  L^nited  States.  The  f)nly  witness 
besides  was  a  French  farmer  called  Lanoueftc.  The  dnel  was  Ajiight  on  "  the  old 
Race  Course."  Lanouette  said  to  Sweeny  :  "  Vous  avez  mal  commence  votre  jonrnee." 
At  the  (Irand  Jury,  no  witnesses  app'^aring,  Sweeny  had  a  "  No  IJill.''  Afterwards 
he  returned  to  Montreal,  but  he  died  not  long  after  from  melancholy  over  the  sad 
event.  He  was  well  known  among  the  Cavalry  Volunteers  of  Montreal  at  that  time, 
and  it  is  said  he  could  hit  a  i)osi  at  full  gallop  ivery  tim^^  so  true  ,ind  sjilendid  a 
marksman  he  was,  hence  the  melancholy  death  of  poor  Major  Ward.

of  the  largest  fortunes  in  the  city.  He  has  ever  been  ready  to  aid  each  good  cause, 
and  especially  his  own  Church,  the  Presbyterian,  has  received  many  substantial  testi- 
monies of  this.  He  is  Vice-President  of  the  Merchants'  Bank,  and  has  always  been 
an  active  worker  in  the  Church.  Mr.  Anderson  has  never  married.  His  property

Montreal  Hi^^h  School,  an  institution  which  has  had  the  honor  of  educating  liinidreds

(;.  J.    15.  LaMOTIIK 


Was  biiin  in  Montreal  on  the  ?4tli  September,  1H24.  His  father,  Captain  M.  I.a- 
Mothc,  was  Superintendent  of  the  Indian  Di-parlinent  from  1816  to  his  death  in 
1826.  He  was  the  Captain  in  command  of  the  Indian  alhes  at  llie  memorable  battle 
of  Cliateaiiguay.  Tiie  grandfather  of  this  skct'^li  was  ( 'a|)tain  Joseph  LaMotiie.  In 
1776,  the  Military  ('onnn;indanl  of  Montreal  entrusted  him  widi  most  im])ortant 
despatches  for  (leneral  (luy  Carleton,  then  besieged  in  Quebec.  An  account  of  this 
adventure  is  written  in  the  previous  History  of  Montreal.  paj.;e  20  of  this  liook.  Hon. 
Judge  J?aby  notified  the  writer  that  the  person  was  Mr.  rai)ineau,  the  father  of  the 
celebrated  leader  of  1837-38  ;  but  I  hud  that  Mr.  LaMothe's  grandfather  is  cred- 
ited with  the  adventure.  However,  nothing  is  said  of  placing  the  despatches  in  a 
hollow  staff,  as  is  found  in  a  note  in  one  of  tiie  large  Histories  of  Canada,  I  think 
Smith's.  Be  that  as  it  may,  the  arrival  of  the  letters,  etc.,  in  ])roijer  time  con- 
tributed to  the  salvation  of  ()uebec,  as  the  inhabitants  were  ready  for  the  .Americans 
under  (leneral  Montgomery  when  he  arrived  to  besiege  the  city.  The  l^aMothes 
have  been,  and  are  one  of  the  oldest  families  in  Montreal.  They  caine  originally 
from  liordeaux,  France.  Mention  is  made  of  the  family  in  1673,  and  we  find  one 
Pierre  de  St.  Paul  de  I.aMothe  as  (Commander  of  the  Town  and  Island  of  Montreal  in 
the  year  1689. 

The   subject   of  our  sketch  was  educated  at  St.   Hyacinthe  College,  and  after- 
wards at  Montreal  College.     He  had  for  some  years   been  in  the  \'oluntcer  Cavalry 
before  he  was  transferred  to  and  promoted  Major  commanding  the  Rifle  Companies 
(police)  active  force  in  Montreal.     In  1861,  he  was  appointed  C'hief  of  Police  of  the 
city,  and  held  that  office  to  1865,  when   he  resigned.     It  was  Mr.   LaMothe,  in  his 
official  capacity,  that  effected  the  capture  of  the  celebrated  St.  Albans  Raiders.     On 
the  15th  July,  1874,  he  was  appointed  Postmaster  of  Montreal,  and  continued  to  fill 
this   important  ofHce  till    1891,  when  he  retired  on  a    jiension.     He  has   travelled 
'  .&lt;tensively  on  the  Continent  of  Europe  and  in  K.ngland.     When  he  was  in  England 
he  joined  an  exjjedition  against   Ecuador  (South  America),  which,  after  jjutting  to 
sea,  was  overtaken  by  a  Urilish  man-of-war  and  brought  back  to  London.     He  also 
took  part  in  the  French  Revolution  of  1848,  and  at  the  storming  of  theTuilleries  Mr. 
LaMothe  was  one  of  the   very  first  to  enter    the  Palace.     After  this  he  frvelled  on 
foot  all  through  Switzerland  and  Italy,  and  here  in  the  sunny   land  of  Italia  he  be- 
came a  benedict,  having  married  in  Rome,  in  1850,  Marguerite  de  Savoye.     He  re- 
turned to  Canada  and  his  native  city.     He  has  one  son,  an  Advocate  of  Montreal 
Bar,  and  four  daughters.     Tiie  oldest  is  married  to  Hon.  J.  R.  Thibaudeau,  Senator 
for  the  division  of  Rigaud,  and  now  the  efficient  Sheriff  for  Montreal  and  District, 
and  another  is  married  to  a  gentleman  of  Quebec.     Mr.  LaMothe's  career  bears  out 
what  I  have  said  of  all  the  living  or  dead  true  Montrealers,  that  every  one  of  them 
has  made  his  mark  either  on  the  political,  social,  literary  or  mercantile  platforms  of 
his  native  city  and  coimtry.

of  tiiat    well-known   Prelate,  the  liisliop  of  Montreal.     In  1.S76,  owing  to  infirmity 

and  old    age,  he   resii^ned   his  seat,  and  was  made  Titular  Ar&lt;hl)isliop   of  Marian- 

o|)olis  (in  parlibus).      His  life  was  an   eventfid  one,  and  his  sermons  to  the  Roman 

Catholics    in   Canada  can     never    be   over  estimated.     He    brought    no    less    than 

fifteen  religious  orders  into  the  country,  among  which   may  be   mentioned  "The 

Jesuits,"     "Oblates."     "Ikotliers    of    the    Christian    Seiiools,"     ''Fathers    of    the 

Holy  Cross,"  "Sister    cf  Providence,"  -'Sisters  of  the  (iood  Shepherd,"  "Brothers 

of  Charity,"  etc.     Such  was  his  rei)Utation  for  sanctity  that  many  miracles  have  been 

attributed  to  him.     He  celebrated  the  (ioldcn  Jubilee  of  his  ordination  in  1882,  and 

died  June,   1S85,    leaving    a  name  which    all  classes    and  creetls   united  to    honor. 

The  writer  and  Author  of  this  book  adds  that  the  good  Archbishop  entirely  ap])roved 

of  his  work,  "The  Harp  of  Canaan,"  and  one   of  the  most  flattering  letters    ever 

received  by  an  Author  was  issued  from  the  Palace  to  him  by   one  of  the  Canons  in 

regard  to  the  same  book.

^VAs  i)orn  in  Longueuil  in  1806.  In  1817,  Dr.  Kimber,  of  Montreal,  seeing  the  boy's 
jirecocity  and  ap'iitude,  took  him  under  his  patronage,  sent  him  to  school  and  then 
to  college.  Such  was  his  ardor  and  assiduity  that  on  the  25lh  February,  1828,  he 
was  received  as  a  Doctor,  and  established  himself  at  St.  Benoit,  in  the  County  of 
Two  Mountains.  In  1831,  he  married  Miss  Labrieand  then  went  to  Saint  Eustache, 
entering  with  all  his  heart  and  soul  into  the  troubles  of  1837-38.  He  was  slain  at 
Saint  F^ustaciie,  in  the  battle  between  the  Patriots  and  the  Queen's  Troops.  Of  all 
the  Chiefs  of  the  Patriots,  Chenier  is  the  one  whose  memory  will  last  the  longest. 
His  death  attests  the  sincerity  of  his  patriotism,  and  justifies  the  confidence  the 
people  placed  in  him.  As  Mr.  L.  O.  David  says  : — "  Les  Canadiens  Fran&lt;,;ais  ne 
cesseront  jamais  de  se  rdpeter,  de  p6re  en  fils,  le  r(5cit  de  sa  mort  heroique,  et  long- 
temps  on  dira:  '  Brave  comme  Chenier.' " 

FENNINGS  TAYLOR 

Was  born  in  London,  and  came  to  Toronto  in  1836.  He  was  all  his  life  connected 
with  the  Government  offices.  As  a  writer  he  is,  perhaps,  one  af  the  most  favorably 
known.  His  style  is  beautiful,  and  his  flights  of  rhetoric  are  telling.  What  brought 
him  fame  was  his  "  Portraits  of  British  Americans,"  by  William  Notman,  Montreal, 
with  Biographical  Sketches  by  Fennings  Taylor,  in  three  volumes  of  four  hundred 
pages  each.  He  also  wrote  "  The  Three  Last  Bishops  appointed  by  the  Crown 
in  Canada,"  and  published  by  John  Lovell,  Montreal,  and  another  well-known  work 
of  his  that  was  also  published  in  Montreal,  on  the  murder  of  Hon.  T.  D'Arcy  McGee, 
with  a  full  account  of  his  funeral  in  that  City.

great  work  is  *' 1812,  Tlic  War  audits  Moral.  A  Canadian  ('hronicle."  He  has 
made  a  most  interesting  narrative  of  one  of  the  most  important  periods  in  Canadian 
History,  and  every  after  writer  lias  drawn  considerably  from  his  well-written  book 
when  writing  on  the  War  of  181J.  His  name  will  ever  be  leiuembered  in  Canadian 
History  as  a  reliable,  honest  and  valuable  writer  on  the  war  between  his  native 
country  and  tiie  United  States. 

MICHEL  BIBAUD 

Was  born  in  1782,  and  died  1857.  He  was  a  great  historian,  and  his  History  of 
Canada  to  this  day  holds  a  first  part  in  the  annals  of  the  country.  "The  Voyage  of 
Franchere  "  is  also  another  interesting  and  instructive  book,  containing  much  infor- 
mation of  America  from  1810101814.  It  was  published  in  Montreal  in  the  year 
1820,  and  is,  perhaps,  one  of  the  best  and  oldest  of  our  literature.  C,  B.  Pas- 
teur, of  Montreal,  was  the  printer. 

JACQUES    VIGER. 

He  is  otherwise  called  Commander  Viger,  and  was  born  in  Montreal,  in  17S7,  and

was  called  by  the  name  of  the  College  of  St.  Raphael.  In  the  War  of  1812,  he  was  an 
officer  under  DeSalaberry.  He  passed  the  greater  part  of  his  life  as  a  collector  of 
historical  documents  and  pamphlets  pertaining  to  the  history  cf  the  country.  Every- 
body consulted  Jacques  Viger  on  any  difficult  historical  point.  He  was  Mayor  of 
Montreal  in  1832,  and  was  recommended  by  Lord  Gosford  to  a  seat  in  the  Legisla- 
tive and  Executive  Council.  He  was  a  great  writer,  and  perhaps  his  most  interesting 
work  for  Montreal  was  that  published  in  i84i,and  titled,  "  Rapports  surles  chemins, 
rues,  ruelles,  ponts  de  la  Ch€  et  Paroisse  de  Montreal  avec  Notes,"  Huston,  a  well- 
known  writer,  calls  him  ''  Le  Benediction  du  Canada."  Every  one  who  wrote  on 
Canada  in  his  time  consulted  him  freely — as  Garneau,  Taillon,  Mergry,  Aup^re.  etc. 
He  was  an  ornament  to  his  native  city. 

DR.  GAUVIN. 

He  belonged  to  one  of  the  most  estimable  families  of  Montreal.  His  mother  and 
sisters  are  gratefully  remembered  for  their  help  and  assistance  to  the  Patriot  pri- 
soners, and  their  charity.  The  sisters  afterwards  were  Mrs.  Brault  and  Mrs.  Ostell. 
Dr.  Gauvin  contracted  disease  whilst  incarcerated  as  a  political  offender  in  the 
Montreal  Gaol,  and  died  not  long  after  the  cessation  of  the  troubles  of  1837-38.

IIF.CTOR  MrNKO. 

The  subject  of  this  skctcli  was  born  Id  IJlaiiisbe,  Roxboroiighsliiic,  Scoilainl,  on 
tin-  21st  Jiinury.  1807.  When  lie  was  ;il)()iil  twenty-four  years  of  age  his  parents 
leit  FManisIie  to  reside  in  the  City  of  I",ihn burgh.  Hector  went  with  tliein,  liaving 
learnt  his  trade  in  his  native  place  with  his  father,  who  was  a  contractor.  Marrying 
at  tile  age  of  twenty-five,  he  and  his  wife,  in  1832,  left  Scotland  for  America.  They 
made  Canada  tiieir  destination,  and  arrived  in  Montreal  the  same  year,  (^uite  a 
misfortune  overtook  them  on  their  way  out,  tlie  ship  having  bei'n  wrecked,  and  the 
newlv  wedded  couple  lost  all  they  possessed  save  their  clothes.  With  his  indomi- 
table |)luck  he  soon  set  U])  for  himself  in  Montreal,  and  prospered  as  a  (onlractor. 
Some  of  the  largest  and  most  iin|)oriani  buildings  and  highways  were  constructed  by 
him.  The  well-known  Bonsecours  Market  was  one  of  his  largest  public  buildings. 
He  had  very  large  contracts  with  the  (lovernment  on  the  Lachine  and  Rideau  Canals, 
and  also  at  Sorel,  Three  Rivers,  St.  b)hns,  and  Chambly. 

[n  railways  he  was  also  ..  large  contractor,  being  empluyetl  on  the  Lachine  Rail- 
way, and  es])ecially  on  the  (iraiid  Trunk  between  Longueui!  and  the  Province  Line. 
In  all  these  undertakings  Mr.  Munro  displayed  remarkable  energy 

He  held  the  office  of  Protestant  School  Commissioner  for  some  years,  and  his 
practical  knowledge  was  of  the  utmost  importance  to  the  School  Board  in  the  build- 
ing of  several  of  their  large  schools.  He  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the  Mechanics' 
Institute,  one  of  its  Presidents,  and  an  active  mepMicr  till  within  a  few  years  of  his 
death. 

He  was  also  a  great  friend  and  supporter  of  the  Bible  Society  of  Montreal,  and 
almost  daily  visited  the  Bible  House  to  give  any  help  or  advice  required.  After 
an  eventful  and  active  life  he  died  on  the  5th  Oet(;ber.  1888,  aged  eighty-one. 

At  the  special  meeting  of  the  Committee  of  the  Bible  Society  after  his  death, 
the  following  resolution  was  unanimously  passed  and  sent  to  his  family  : — "  The 
Committee  have  heard  with  much  concern  the  intelligence  now  received  of  the 
sudden  decease  of  their  esteemed  colleague,  and  they  desire  to  place  on  record  their 
high  sense  of  the  value  of  the  services  rendered  by  him  to  this  Society,  in  various  ways, 
during  the  long  period  of  his  connection  with  it,  and  also  of  the  loss  the  Society  has 
sustained  by  his  death,  whereby  it  will  be  deprived  of  his  unfailing  interest  and  long 
continued  efforts  to  promote  the  work  in  which  it  is  engaged.'' 

He  left  three  sons  and  three  daughters.  One  daughter  is  married  to  our  well- 
known  and  highly  respected  citizen,  Mr.  James  Haite,  Chemist  and  Druggist,  whose 
establishment,  for  over  thirty  years,  has  been  a  landmark  in  Central  Notre  Dame 
street.  Another  daughter  is  married  to  Dr.  McBean,  late  of  Martintown,  Ontario? 
and  now  of  this  City.

His  father,  Chevalier  de  la  Legion  d'honneur,  received  one  silver  medal  in  1H08 
from  the  l'.mi)er()r  Nai)oleon  the  ist,  and  another  in  iSiSfrom  I,oiiis  the  iMih,

lie  look  his  degree  as  r)octor  in  Medicine  in  1831,  and  arrived  in  Monlieal  in 
iS;^3.  Foreign  l)ii)Iom.is  not  being  admitted  in  Canada  at  that  time,  he  was  em- 
ployed as  I'rotessor  of  French  Literalnre  by  the  most  important  schools  of  the  day. 

In  183S,  the  law  having  been  altered,  he  took  his  licence  to  practice  medicine, 
and  soon  opened  a  pharmacy,  which  to  this  tlay  has  ranked  amongst  the  best  in  the 
city. 

Called  to  succeed  T.  Doncet,  Fsq.,  he  was  appointed  by  the  French  (lovern- 
ment,  in  1868,  Agent  Consulaire  of  l'"rance,  and  promoted  to  the  (irade  of  Vice- 
Consul  in  1869.     He  died  some  years  ago. 

CHARLES  HEAVYSEGE 

Was  born  in  Liverpool,  England,  on  the  2nd  of  May,  1816.  Arriving  in  Montreal 
he  took  up  the  work  of  a  machinist.  Afterwards  he  became  a  local  reporter  for  the 
Witness.  He  was  over  forty  years  old  before  he  published  any  poetry.  He  pub- 
lished ".Saul,''  his  greatest  work,  in  1857.  This  work  fell  into  the  hands  of  Haw- 
thorne, who  had  it  favorably  reviewed  in  the  North  British  Re7&lt;iew.  Longfellow 
and  Fmersonboth  spoke  highly  of  its  excellence.  Longfellow  declared  it  "The  best 
tragedy  written  since  the  days  of  Shakespeare."  After  this  his  adopted  countrymen 
discovered  that  they  had  a  genius  of  no  common  order  amongst  them.  \\\  i860  he 
published  "  Count  Philippo  ",  and  in  1865  his  "Jephtha's  Daughter,"  a  drama  in 
some  respects  even  superior  to  that  of  "  Saul."  The  sanie  year  he  printed  the  novel, 
"  The  Advocate,"  a  story  of  old  Montreal.  The  last  poem  he  sent  to  the  press, 
just  before  his  death,  was  "  The  Dark  Huntsman."  His  death  occurred  in  August, 
1876,  in  Montreal,  where  he  had  resided  ever  since  his  arrival,  twenty-eight  years 
before. 

WILLIAM  II.  HICKS, 

He  is  a  native  of  Portsmouth,  England,  being  born  on  the  17th  November,  18 16. 
After  teaching  school  for  fourteen  years  in  England,  he  came  to  Montreal  in  connec- 
tion with  the  Colonial  Church  and  School  Society.  When  the  Normal  Schools 
were  established  Mr.  Hicks  was  made  Professor  of  English  Literature,  Sir  William 
Dawson  being  President.  About  187 1,  he  resigned  the  situation  on  account  of  old 
age.  He  married  in  1843  Isabella  Barron  of  London,  and  has  a  large  family,  the 
most  noted  being  Francis,  known  as  Frank  Hicks,  who  was  one  of  our  most 
popular  teachers  in  Montreal  some  years  ago.

Solicilor-dencral  in  1X57,  entering  Parliament  the  same  year  for  theCityof  Montreal. 
In  185H.  he  was  Receiver-deneral  of  Canada,  and  Mmister  of  Public  Works  in  1H59. 
He  became  Finance  Minister  and  a  member  of  the  Privy  Council  in  1S67.  Resign- 
ing otFice  in  1869,  he  removed  to  London,  England,  in  icSyo,  and  there  became  a 
partner  in  the  Itanking  firm  of  Morton,  Rose  vV  Co.  He  was  sent  on  a  confidential 
mission  t.  the  United  .Slates  after  the  Civil  War  in  connection  with  the  settlement  of 
difficulties  arising  from  it  between  the  coimtries.  This  resulted  in  the  Treaty  of 
^Vashinglon.  For  this  service  the  Queen  created  him  a  Uaronet.  In  1X69,  he  again 
went  to  Washington  for  the  Dominion  (iovernment  on  the  subje&lt;:t  of  Reciprocity, 
the  Fisheries,  and  other  International  (luestions.  Afterwards  the  (^ueen  made  him  a

He  was  a  trustee  of  the  Royal  College  of  Music,  and  a  member  of  the  Council  of  the 
Duchy  of  Cornwall.  For  the  last  ten  years  of  his  life  he  took  an  active  part  in  Lon- 
don affairs,  being  a  Director  of  both  the  Westminster  and  London  Hanks  and  Royal 
F'.xchange  Insurance  Co.,  and  a  Deputy-Governor  of  the  Hudson  15ay  Co.,  and  the

in  Montreal,  on  accoimt  of  the  Major  Ward  duel  in  1838,  and  his  second  wife  was 
the  Dowager  Marchioness  of  Tweedale,  In  early  life  he  was  a  teacher  of  a  little 
school  in  Himtingdon,  his  parents  having  settled  in  that  locality. 

The  remarkable  career  of  Sii  John  Rose  should  be  an  incentive  to  the  present 
generation.  What  has  been  done  can  be  done,  and  in  the  comjng  century  more 
wonderful  things  will  yet  be  done.  Let  then  the  young  man's  motto  ever  be 
"  Excelsior." 

HON.  JUDGE  McKAY.

year  an  Assistant  Judge  of  the  Court  of  Queen's  Bench.  After  many  years  of  useful- 
ness he  died  some  time  ago.  He  is  remembered  by  his  gift  of  valuable  pictures 
to  the  Art  Gallery,  and  other  donations  to  different  institutions.  He  was  a  man  of 
sterling  value,  virtue  and  respect ;  tall,  spare  and  somewhat  stern,  nevertheless  the 
public  had  great  confidence  in  his  legal  decisions.

HON.    THOS,   WHITK 

AVas   born   in   Montreal,   on  the  7th    August,  1830.      His  father  was  Irish  and  his 
mother  Scotch.      His  father  was  a  leather  merchant  for  many  years  in  Montreal.  'I"he 
subject  of  this  sketch  was  sent  to  the  Higli  School  where  he  obtained  a  good  educa- 
tion.    After  leaving  school  he  engaged  for  some  time  in  mercantile   jiursuits,  but 
soon  abandoned  this  and  accepted  a  position  on  the  (,)uebec  Gazette.     In  i.Ssj,  he 
started  with  his  brother-in-law,  Robert  I'iomain,  the  l\'lerboro'  Revieu&lt;,  and  was  con- 
nected with   this  pa|)er  until   i860.     After  this  he  studied  i,aw  for  four  years.      In 
1864,  with  !iis  brother,  Richard  White,  he  went  to  Hamilton  and  became  (iroprietor 
of  the  Spcrtator.     Here  he  resided  till   1870.     Afterwards  they  relumed  to  their 
native  city  and  bougiit  the   Gazette,  making  it   to  this  day  the  chief  Conservative 
Knglish  paper  for  the   Province.     In  1879,  the  name  of  the  tirm  was  changed  from 
T.  (S;    R.   White,  to  "  The  Gazette  I'rinting  Co."     In  1878,  he  was  first  returned  to 
Parliament  for  Cardwell.     In  1885,  Mr.  White  was  invited  by  Sir  John  A.  Macdonald

tinued as  a  Privy  Councillor  to  his  death,  which   occurred  some  few  years  ago.    His 
funeral  was  one  of  the   largest  seen    for  years   in    Montreal.     All  denominations  of 
Christians  and  nationalities   turned  out  to  do  respect  to  one  of  their  own   citizens, 
one  born  in  Montreal,  and  of  whom  Montrealers  may  feel  proud.

W\,s  born  in  tllenorchy,  Argylshire,  in  1788;  canie  to  Canada  in  i8.'3  ;  went  to 
New  Glasgow  for  four  years,  but  returned  to  Montreal  in  1827.  In  the  spring  of 
183 1,  Mr.  Fletcher  met  with  an  accident  which  ultimately  caused  his  death  same 
year.  His  son,  John  Fletcher,  was  born  in  (ireenock  on  the  23rd  May,  1815.  The 
late  Mr.  John  Hruce,  Inspector  of  Schools,  when  John  was  tifteen  or  sixteen  years 
old  had  him  as  one  of  his  besi  pupils,  but  Archibald,  his  father,  dying  as  above  said, 
he  had  to  leave  school  at  sixteen  and  assist  his  mother.  In  1834,  he  organized 
for  the  city  a  Hook  and  Ladder  Co.  which  did  good  service  until  CS40,  when  a  Fire 
Department  was  instituted  by  Charter  for  the  city.  In  1837-38,  he  was  two  years  a 
Volunteer  in  the  Scotch  Company  No.  6,  and  in  1840,  when  the  troubles  were  over, 
Mr.  I'letcher  joined  the  Fire  Brigade,  and  in  1845  ^^^s  appointed  Captain.  Lj  1849,

CAZKTTEER    OF    MONTRKAL.  U&gt;3 


JOSEPH  DUHAMEL,  Q.C. 


The  subject  of  tliis  sketch  was  born  in  the  City  of  Montreal  on  tiie  20th  day  of 
January^  1836.  His  father  was  Joseph  Duhanicl,  a  merchant,  wiio  died  at  the  ail- 
vanccd  age  of  eighty-eight  years.     His  mother  was  D'^nv/hihJe  Moiisset. 

At  the  age  of  seven,  Mr.  Joseph  Duhamel  entered  the  preparatory  depart- 
ment of  tlie  College  of  St.  Th^rese  ;  he,  subsequently,  followed  a  full  course  of 
studies  at  the  College  of  St.  Hyacinthe  and  at  the  Jesuits'  CoUetjc  in  Montreal.  At 
the  age  of  nineteen  he  had  completed  a  brilliant  classical  education. 

The  great  oratorical  qualities  which  iie  had  developed  at  college,  his  sound 
reasoning  and  argument,  shewed  at  their  early  stage  that  he  was  destined  to  become 
an  ornament  of  the  legal  profession  ;  and  immediately  upon  leaving  the  college  ho 
selected  Law  as  his  profession.  He  passed  his  course  of  legal  studies  in  the  office  of 
Messrs.  Badgley  iV  Abbott,  two  of  the  most  eminent  Barristers  at  that  time. 

Upon  his  admission  to  the  Bar  on  the  7th  of  Ai)ril,  1857,  he  formed  a  partner, 
ship  with  the  late  Cyrille  Archambault,  a  lawyer  of  great  reputation  in  the  profession- 
wiio,  whiliit  travelling,  came  to  an  untimely  deatli  by  the  explosion  of  the  boiler  of 
the  steamer  "St.  John,"  on  the  Hudson  River,  near  New  York. 

He  subsequently  made  a  partnership  witii  Mr.  Gustave  Drolet.  a  Chevalier  of 
the  Legion  of  H(jnor  (France),  who  has  since  retired  from  the  practice  of  his  pro- 
fession. Mr.  Duhamel  afterwards  became  the  hjad  of  the  firm  of  "  Duhamel,  Rain- 
ville,  Rinfret  &amp;  Rainville." 

The  acceptance  by  one  member  of  this  firm  of  a  Superior  Court  Judgeship  and 
the  demise  of  another  resulted  in  the  formation  of  that  of  '•  Duhamel,  Pagnuelo  &amp; 
Rainville," 

At  the  present  time,  Mr.  Duhamel  is  the  senior  member  of  the  firm  of  "  Duhamel, 
Marceau  &amp;  Merrill." 

In  1878,  he  was  appointed  a  Queen's  Counsel  by  the  Government  of  the  Province 
of  Quebec.  The  Liberal  party  was,  at  that  time,  in  power  in  tint  Province.  The 
right  of  Provincial  Governments  to  confer  this  title  was,  later  on,  put  in  cpiestion  by 
the  Federal  authorities,  who  contended  that  they  alone  had  the  power,  under  the 
Constitution  of  Canada,  to  make  such  appointments.  However,  Mr.  Duhamel  cannot 
be  said  to  enjoy  a  doubtful  honor,  for,  shortly  afterwards,  he  received  another  com- 
mission from  the  Government  of  Canada,  appointing  him  Queen's  Counsel,  although 
he  was  their  political  opponent, — the  Conservative  party  being  in  power. 

Owing  to  his  high  reputation  among  his  fellow  countrymen,  his  great  oratorical 
ability,  his  knowledge  of  the  law,  and  his  unbounded  energy  and  devotion  to  his  pro- 
fession, Mr.  Duhamel,  immediately  on  his  entering  the  Bar,  commanded  one  of  the 
largest  practices  in  the  Province  of  Quebec. 

His  legal  career  has  been  very  lucrative  to  himself.  He  is  one  of  the  legal 
advisers  of  the  "  Grand  Trunk  Railway  Company,"  the  "  Canada  Atlantic  Railway 
Company,"  the  "  Jacques  Cartier  Union  Railway,"  the  "St.  Lawrence  and  Adiron- 

13

dack  Railway  Company,"  and  commands  also  a  large  commercial  practice,  represent- 
ing many  wholesale  houses. 

During  his  legal  career  he  obtained  very  great  success  in  several  important  law- 
suits  with  which  lie   was  connectca    amongst  others    that  of    Duncan   McDonald 
against  the  (Irand  Trunk  Railway  Coi  ipany,  involving  nearly  $100,000 ;  and  also  in 
obtaining  for  the  same  company  the  se  tlement  with  the  City  of  Montreal  of  dispu- 
ted claims  reaching  nearly  one  million  and  a  half  of  dollars  ;  then  the  cases  on  writ  of 
injunction  and  in  dainages  amr  unting  to  more  than  one  million  and  a  half  of  dollars 
of  Messrs.  Stanton  lv  Balch  against  the  Canada  Atlantic   Ruii»vay  Company  were 
also  decided  in  favor  of  his  clients,  the  Canada  Atlantic  Railway  Company.  These 
cases  were  most  complicated  as  well  on  questions  of  law  as  of  facts,  and  were  tried 
before  all  tiie  Courts  of  the  Dominion  of  Canada.     We  might  also  mention  the  case 
of   Mr.  Charles  Alexander  against  Mr.  Samuel  Nordheimer,  involving  many    very 
important  legal  questions,  which  case  was   also  carried  before  all  the  courts  of  the 
land,  and  was  always  decided  in  favor  of  his  client. 

In  days  when  the  question  of  representation  according  to  nationality  in  the  City 
Council  was  very  prominent,  and  the  exigencies  to  serve  therein  seemed  to  demawd 
the  very  best  talent,  the  residents  of  St.  Mary's  Ward  sohcited  him  to  become  a 
candidate,  and  he  was  elected  by  a  large  majority.  He  served  in  tiie  City  Council  of 
Montreal  before  he  obtained  his  majority  an  example  of  jjopular  favor  unknown  in 
the  history  of  Montreal's  Municipal  Government. 

Mr.  Duhamel  did  not  disappoint  the  anticipations  of  those  who  had  brought  him 
forward.  Indeed,  so  thoroughly  satisfied  were  they  with  their  choice  tiiat,  when  his 
term  of  office  had  expired,  his  constituents  strongly  urged  him  to  present  himself 
again,  but  he  declined  on  account  of  his  professional  duties.  Some  years  afterwards, 
yielding  to  the  pressure  of  his  friends,  leading  merchants,  lawyers,  etc.,  etc.,  of  the 
Montreal  East  Ward,  Mr.  Duhamel  was  re-elected  their  representative  for  three 
years  more,  during  which  time  he  devoted  himself  with  uiuch  zeal  and  assiduity  to 
the  interests  of  Montreal. 

During  the  last  twenty  years  Mr.  Duhamel  has  been  repeatedly  solicited  to 
become  a  candidate  for  the  mayoralty.  Several  times  large  and  influential  depu- 
tations of  men,  representing  all  nationalities  and  professions,  have  waited  upon  him 
and  urged  him  to  allow  himself  to  be  put  in  nomination  ;  but,  his  professional  duties 
requiring  all  his  time,  he  declined. 

In  politics,  Mr.  Duhamel  has  always  been  a  Liberal,  and  for  his  assistance,  both 
by  his  pen  and  as  a  speaker  on  the  public  platforms,  the  Liberal  party  is  under  very 
considerable  obligation. 

Immediately  on  his  leaving  college,  he  took  an  active  part  in  electoral  struggles. 
At  the  age  of  twenty,  he  was  the  victim  of  his  devotion  to  his  party  during  an  election 
which  took  place  for  the  Senatorship  in  the  Alma  Division,  a  thorough  Conservative 
constituency.  At  a  meeting  of  the  whole  Division,  which  took  place  at  Sault-au- 
RecoUet,  neai  Montreal,  in  spite  of  the  warnings  of  his  friends,  and  in  defiance  of 


GAZETTEER  OF  MONTRKAL,  195 

ihe  threats  of  a  very  large  crowd,  composed  of  several  thousand  persons,  lie  siicceeled 
in  gaining  the  platform,  where  he  spoke  so  successfully  that  the  political  enemies  of 
the  Liberal  paity,  in  order  to  put  an  end  to  the  discussion,  overturned  the  hustings. 
Then  the  infuriated  mob  attacked  him  with  sticks,  fired  several  pistol  shuts  at  iiim, 
beat  him  and  left  him  for  dead.  Whrn  attended  to,  it  was  found  that  two  of  his  riljs 
and  ins  right  arm  had  been  broken,  and  that  his  head  had  received  several  sore  cuts 
as  a  result  of  which  he  was  confin-jd  to  his  bed  for  several  weeks. 

Mr.  Duhamel  Ikh  repeatedly  been  asked  to  become  a  candidate  for  legislative 
honors,  but  has  always  preferred  to  devote  himself  to  the  Law,  a  career  in  which  his 
energy  and  ability  have  been  crowned  with  success. 

On  Die  2.Sth  of  April,  1882,  as  a  mark  of  respect  as  well  as  in  acknowledgment 
of  his  well-known  talents  and  faithfulness  to  his  party,  at  a  general  meeting  of  the 
leaders  of  the  Liberal  party,  which  was  held  at  Montreal,  Mr.  Du'amel  w.is  unani- 
mously electeil  President  of  the  "  Reform  Association." 

It  is  not  unreasonable  to  suppose  that  the  sterling  (jualities  which  have  enabled 
him  to  fulfill  so  well  his  duties  will  win  success  in  a  still  more  extensive  field  of  actijii  ; 
and  should  he  ultimately  consent  10  enter  the  political  arena,  he  will  no  doubt  attain 
the  position  which  his  ability  marks  out  for  him. 

Having  paid  several  visits  to  Europe  he  has  availed  himself  of  all  the  advan- 
tages and  opportunities  afforded  thereby.  He  knows  how  to  respect  the  honest  con- 
victions of  others,  and  is  prepared  to  grant  to  them  the  toleration  and  privileges  he 
claims   for  himself. 

He  was  married  in  1859  to  Miss  Alphonsine  Masson,  a  daughter  of  the  late  Mr. 
Damase  Masson,  who  was  formerly  one  of  the  most  eminent  wholesale  merchants  of 
the  City  of  Montreal,  and  one  of  its  most  useful  and  enterprising  citizens.

JAMES  DUNCAN 

Was  htirii  in  Cokrainc,  Ireland,  in  1806.  Ho  ame  lo  Montreal  in  1830,  where  he 
was  for  years  a  most  successful  artist  and  teacher  of  drawing.  He  drew  the  skeK  iu-s 
of  that  rare  book  ''  Hoc  helaga  hepicta."  which  was  published  in  [829.  He  was 
jirincipally  a  water-color  |)ainter;  nearly  all  the  i)rincipal  Institutes  of  this  city  had 
hitn  as  teaclier.  Some  of  his  larger  works  are  reckoned  among  the  best  in  Montreal, 
such  as  that  one  rejiresenting  the  "(fiants  Ciius{;way,"  Ireland.  He  dieil  2Sth 
September,  1880.  Two  of  his  sons  have  held  C(jmmissions  as  Surgeons  in  the  r.riiish 
Army,  Ur.  J.  S.  Duncn,  late  of  tin;  8ist  Kegt.,  now  of  Plymouth,  and  Dr.  Geo. 
Duncan,  who  retired  from  Her  Majesty's  service  and  has  a  large  practice  in  Ports- 
mouth, Kngland.     A  third  son,  David,  is  in  the  t'ustoms  Department  of  .Montreal. 

J(J.SK1II  DOUTki:,  (j.i  . 

TnK  iiistory  of  Mr.  Doutre's  life  is  that  of  the  struggles  ot  his  countrymen  for  civil 
and  religious  liberty,  and  is,  therefore,  of  more  than  personal  interest.  His  ancestors 
were  from  the  old  province  of  Roussillon,  in  the  department  ot  Pyrenees-Orientales. 
His  grandfather  came  from  the  immediate  neighborhood  of  Perpignan,  and  had 
hardly  arrived  in  Canada  when  the  country  passed  under  the  dominion  of  I'^ngland. 
Mr.  Doutre  was  born  at  Heauharnois,  in  1S25,  and  was  educated  at  the  Montreal 
College.  He  was  admilted  to  the  Bar  in  i&lt;S47.  In  1844,  at  the  age  of  eighteen,  his 
first  work,  a  romance  of  five  hundred  p.iges,  eiiiiilcd  :  Lcs  Fiances  de  1812  (The 
Betrothed  of  1812),  was  published.  He  was  an  early  adherent  of  the  Institut 
Canadien,  and  ever  since  the  warm  friend  of  that  institution,  which  obtained  its 
charter  under  his  presidency.  As  soon  as  the  Avciiir  newspaper  had  taken  a  fair 
start  in  1848,  Mr.  Doutre  became  one  of  its  contributors.  Mr.  Doutre  has  been  a 
liberal  contributor  to  the  newspaper  press,  and  most  of  the  journals  of  the  province 
have  at  times  published  contributions  from  him.  In  1848,  he  published  Le  Fi'icet 
1(1  S(VUf\  which  was  afterwards  republished  in  Paris.  In  1851,  he  was  the  author  of 
the  laureate  essay,  paid  for  by  the  late  Hon  Mr.  DeBoucherville,  on  "  The  best 
means  of  spending  time  in  the  interest  of  the  tamilyand  the  Country.'"  In  1S52  was 
published  Le  Sauvagt  dii  Canada.  To  these  should  be  added  a  series  of  biographical 
essays  on  the  most  prominent  political  men  of  that  date  which  appeared  in  the 
Avenir.  As  one  of  the  Secretaries  of  the  Association  formed  in  1849  for  the 
Colonization  of  the  'J'ownships,  he  was  instrumental  in  starting  the  first  settlements 
of  Roxton  and  the  vicinity,  which  work,  it  is  said,  Mr.  Cartier  did  much  to  impede. 
In  1853,  Mr.  Doutre  took  the  direction  of  the  great  struggle  for  the  abolition  of  the 
feudal  tenure,  and  by  means  of  meetings  lield  throughout  the  country,  and  diligence 
and  care  in  the  preparation  of  practical  measures  the  agitation  came  to  a  crisis  at  the 
General  Elections  of  1854,  when  the  Parliament,  filled  with  moderate  abolitionists, 
passed  a  law  wliich  did  away  with  this  mediieval  system  of  land  tenure,  to  the 
mutual  satisfaction  both  of  the  seigniors  and  tenants.     Another  campaign  of  equal

importance  bewail  inum-diately  after  for  miking  the  lA'gislalivc  Council  elective 
inste.ici  of  being  nominated  by  the  Crown,  and  a  law  was  passed  to  this  effect  in  iH5^», 
at  whirli  time  Mr.  Doutn-  was  reijuested  to  stand  as  candidate  for  the  I)ivision  of 
Salaberry,  but  lie  was  defeated.  In  1H5.S,  there  conunenced  in  a  decided  manner  on 
tiic  ])art  of  the  Roman  Catholic  liishop  of  Montreal,  the  long  looming  wt)rk  of 
destruction  against  everything  which  gave  manifestation  of  life  in  the  minds  of 
educated  Catholics.  Mr.  Doutre  stood  foremost  in  the  hand  to  hand  battle  which 
followed,  and  the  victory  was  a  painful  one,  being  achieved  in  the  face  of  the  conscien- 
tious opposition  of  many  friends.  In  1861,  Mr.  Doutre,  under  party  pressure, 
aciepted  the  candidature  for  I,aprairie,  which  resulted  in  auotiier  defeat.  This 
election,  however,  had  the  good  effect  of  drawing  attention  to  the  evil  system  of  two 
days'  prilling,  as  it  was  evident  that  his  first  day's  majority  had  been  upset  by  large 
sums  of  money  being  brought  into  play  upon  the  second  day.  i'his  is  the  last  time 
we  find  the  subject  of  our  remarks  in  the  arena  of  politics.  He  then  devoted  himself 
entirely  to  his  profession.  In  1863,  he  became"  (Queen's  Counsel.  In  iS66,  he 
delivered  a  lecture  before  the  Institut  Canadien  on  '"The  Charters  of  Canada," 
a  remarkably  concise  and  complete  synopsis  of  the  jjolitical  constitutions  of  the 
country  under  the  French  Government. 

In  the  same  year  he  was  intrusted  with  the  defence  of  I/imirande,  the  p'rench 
banking  defaulter,  whose  extradition  was  sought  for  before  our  Courts.  After  the 
kidnapping  of  the  man,  when  he  was  about  to  be  released,  he  followed  up  the 
demand  for  his  restoration  to  the  jurisdiction  of  our  Courts,  through  the  Foreign 
Office  in  London,  to  a  point  when  the  Kritish  and  Frencli  Governments  were  very 
seriously  out  of  harmony,  when  Lamirande  solved  the  difficulty  by  surrendering  all 
claims  to  further  negotiations. 

In  1869,  the  refusal  of  the  Roman  Catholic  authorities  to  bury  Guibord,  because 
he  had  been  a  member  of  the  Institut  Canadien,  brought  Mr.  Doutre  face  to  face  with 
the  necessity  of  choosing  between  a  direct  contest  with  the  authorities  of  his  Church  or 
renouncing  liis  right  to  belong  to  a  literary  society,  which  implied  the  right  of  any 
personal  liberty  of  action.  His  choice  in  this  matter  entailed  political  ostracism,  and 
imposed  upon  him  the  most  arduous  task  of  following  the  case  in  question  from  court 
to  court  through  all  the  degrees  of  jurisdiction  in  Canada,  in  order  to  obtain  the 
burial  of  Guibord,  and  of  continuing  the  same  in  Fngland,  where  he  went  to  argue, 
before  the  Privy  Council,  not  only  without  fee,  but  at  his  own  expense,  and  where  he 
gained  at  last  his  case. 

In  1872,  Mr.  Doutre  and  his  friends  brought  the  Institut  Canadien  to  a  con- 
dition of  permanent  and  final  success.  By  a  careful  management  the  institution  was 
made  self-supporting,  but  is  now  defunct.  Mr.  Doutre  was  afterwards  connected 
with  the  Fisheries'  Question  and  other  important  cases.  After  an  eventful  life  he 
died  in  Mont.'=;al  much  regretted  by  a  large  circle  of  friends.

much  vivacity.  He  had  a  briUiant  imagination,  and  we  must  regret  that  he  was  cut 
oft  in  the  Hower  of  his  age  and  the  height  of  his  poetic  aspirations.  But  man  jiroposes

Tiii^  poetess  was  born  at  Magog,  Province  of  (Quebec,  in  i&lt;S35,  and  died  in  1^63, 
at  the  early  age  of  twenty-eight.  Siie  seems  to  hive  been  \m\\\  under  the  wings  of 
poetry.  At  fifteen  years  of  age  she  conijiosed  some  beautiful  verses,  at  twenty  she 
published  a  volume  of  poetry  of  two  hundred  and  fifty  pages,  which  was  publicly 
received  with  favor  and  encouragement.  In  1858,  she  publislied  "The  Hride  of 
(Christ."  Of  this  peculiar  named  production,  even  one  of  our  F'rench  Canadian 
authors,  lately  deceased,  says  :  "Sa  poesic  est  ardeiite,e  t  il  y  a  comme  un  souffle  puissant 
de  g6nie  quiunime  et  vivifte  ses  strojjhes  ;  sa  diction  est  riche  et  variee."  Among 
her  minor  ])ieces  are  those  most  familiar,  '"  Good  Night,"  "  To  a  Dandelion," 
"I  shall  Dejiart,"  and  "  The  Watcher."  I  am  more  than  pleased  in  being  able, 
to  insert  in  the  Ga/i:tteer  this  short  and  imperfect  sketch  of  one  of  our  most  dis- 
tinguished female  writers,  from  what  is  called  in  our  Province  ''  The  Eastern  Town- 
ships." The  Townships  have  given  to  Canada  many  of  our  prominent  business, 
literary  and  political  men  and  women,  and  the  mixture  of  races  as  seen  there  demon- 
strates that  the  mind  is  improved  and  vivified  by  the  same  as  much  as  the  body. 

T.   STERRV    HUNT 

Was  born  at  Norwich,  Connecticut,  on  September  the  5th,  1826.  In  1845,  entered 
Yale  College  as  a  Student,  under  the  well-known  Benjamin  Silliman.  About  1846 
the  Geological  Survey  of  Canada  was  organized,  and  Sir  William  Logan  applied  to 
Professor  Silliman  for  an  assistant,  and  the  subject  of  our  sketch  was  appointed  in 
1847.  Here  he  continued  foi  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century,  and  in  1872  resigned, 
to  pass  the  rest  of  his  life  in  ease  and  comfort. 

He  collected  the  Canadian  specimens  for  the  Foreign  Exhibitions  of  1851,  1856 
and  1867.  He  was  one  of  the  Judges  at  the  Centennial  Exhibition  of  Philadelphia, 
in  1876.  During  1856  to  1862  he  was  one  of  tlie  Professors  of  Laval  University, 
Quebec,  being  that  of  Chemistry — he  is  still  an  honorary  one ;  afterwards  he  was  a 
Lecturer  in  McGill  University.  In  1872,  he  was  Professor  of  Geology  in  Boston  In- 
stitute of  Technology.  He  was  made  M.A.  at  Harvard  in  1852,  Doctor  of  Science  of

the  founders,  also  iliat  of  the  American  Society  for  the  Advancement  of  Science. 
He  was  decorated  by  Napoleon  III  with  the  Legion  of  Honor,  and  the  King  of  Italy 
bestowed  on  him  the  Cross  of  St.  Mauritius  and  St.  Lazarus. 

His  publisheil  articles,  t;ssays  and  writings  on  all  subjects  jjrobably  amount  to 
over  two  hundred.  He  married,  in  1870,  the  oldest  daughter  of  the  well-known  Mr. 
Justice  Gale,  and  has  no  children.  Judge  dale  is  oftened  mentioned  in  the  annals 
of  Montreal  in  the  early  part  of  this  century.*  His  large  farms  have  been  sold  to 
Henry  Hogan,  and  the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway  runs  through  them  now. 

JAMES  A.  CANTT.IE 

Was  born  at  Mortloch,  Banffshire,  Scotland,  on  the  5th  Jiuie,  1836.  After  serving 
some  lime  in  Aberdeen  in  the  dry  goods  business  in  different  establishments,  so  well 
did  he  show  his  ability  in  this  department,  that  on  an  offer  being  given  him  for  Can- 
ada flir  more  propitious  than  that  of  the  Old  Country,  he  left  Aberdeen  and  arrived 
in  Montreal  in  May,  18O3,  entering  the  employ  of  the  firm  of  William  Stephen  «S:  Co. 
For  years  Mr,  Cantlie  was  employed  in  buying  in  England  for  the  firm,  continuing 
thus  till  the  firm  emerged  into  its  present  name  of  Robertson,  Linton  t-S:  Co.  After  this 
he  did  not  (ontinue  long  with  the  new  firm,  entering  into  a  co-partnership  with 
Alexander  Ewing  and  William  Stephen,  in  the  firm  of  Cantlie,  Ewing  «Sr  Co.  He 
was  elected  President  of  the  "  Dominion  Commercial  Travellers'  Association  of 
Montreal"  in  1880,  and  by  acclamation  in  1881.  He  was  the  mainspring  in  the 
suits  connected  witli  the  commercial  tax  laid  on  travellers  in  New  Brunswick  and 
(Quebec,  and  effected  a  lasting  cure  for  a  barbarous  and  feudal  law  and  system  which 
then  prevailed.  He  is  still  devoted  to  his  business,  and  is  now  one  of  the  most  stic- 
cessful  merchants  of  the  city. 

JONATHAN  BARBER,  M.D., 

Was  born  in  London,  England,  April  27th,  1784  ;  was  a  graduate  of  the  Royal  College 
of  Surgeons,  London,  Eng.,  and  i)ractised  extensively  in  Scarboro  and  London.  He 
came  to  America  in  i82i,and  practised  in  Washington,  District  of  Columbia,  but  he 
abandoned  the  practice  of  Medicine  for  the  more  congenial  pursuits  of  general  litera- 
ture and  elocution,  and  many  of  the  American  orators,  notably  Charles  Sumner  and 
Wendell  Phillips,  were  his  pupils  in  Harvard  and  Yale  Universities.  In  1843,  he 
became  warmly  interested  in  Homoeopathy,  and  for  ten  years  practised  it  successfully 
in  Montreal.  His  maternal  grandfather  died  at  eighty,  and  it  was  his  earnest  wish  to 
attain  the  same  age,  and  he  was  eighty  years  and  two  weeks  when  he  died  May  nth, 
1864,  at  Knowlton,  Quebec. 

His  two  daughters  were  well-known.  The  oldest  married  the  late  Judge  Dunkin, 
a  n.an  of  distinguished  learning,  and  one  of  the  most  prominent  workers  of  Montreal 
in  his  day.  She  died  a  few  weeks  ago.  The  other  Miss  Barber  needs  no  pen  of 
mine  to  commend  her  to  the  public.  The  amount  of  good  which  she  has  accom- 
plished in  Montreal  in  her  Sheltering  Home,  her  Rooms  for  Girls,  and  many  other

father  when  associated  with  him  in  the  old  High  School,  and  barber's  method  ot

REV.  DR.  MATHESON 

Was  born  in  1795,  at  Renton,  .Scotland.  Such  was  his  advance  in  college,  that  at 
twenty  he  took  his  degree  of  M.A.  In  1823,  he  was  licensed  to  preach,  and  ordained 
the  same  year.  Shortly  after  he  arrived  in  Montreal  he  was  appointed  to  St. 
Andrew's  Church  of  this  city.  In  1837,  Mr.  Matheson  received  his  Doctor's  degree. 
Happening  to  be  in  Glasgow  at  that  time,  he  visited  the  University  at  the  instal- 
lation of  the  Duke  of  Montrose  as  Chancellor,  and  was  surprised  to  hear  his  own 
name  read  out  as  one  of  those  on  whom  the  honor  of  D.D.  had  been  conferred.  In 
i860,  he  presented  to  the  Prince  of  Wales  the  address  of  welcome  from  the  Presby- 
terian Church  of  Canada.  He  was  connected  with  St.  Andrew's  Society  from  its 
inception,  and  was  the  first  Chaplain,  and  continued  such  for  twenty-five  years. 
After  a  life  of  usefulness,  for  both  his  Church  and  country,  and  after  a  long  illness,  he 
died  on  the  14th  February,  1870,  aged  seventy-five  years.

RICHaRD  ALHKRT  KKNNKOY,  M.I).,  CM. 

Was  born  in  1839,  '"  Montreal.  He  is  the  son  of  the  late  William  Kennedy,  builder, 
formerly  of  Vorkshire,  England.  Kducated  in  the  High  School,  he  commenced  the 
study  of  Medicine  in  i860,  entering  the  University  of  McGill  that  same  year.  He 
completed  the  curriculum  of  studies,  passing  all  the  examinations  and  being  a  partici- 
jKiiit  in  the  first  prize  given  for  the  l)est  examination  in  the  primary  branches  in  1863. 
The  following  year,  1864,  he  received  the  (loid)le  degree  of  M.I).,  CM.,  from  the 
University  of  McGill,  and  in  .May  of  the  same  year  obtained  the  Licence  of  the  Col- 
lege of  Physicians  and  Surgeons  of  Lower  Canada,  becoming  a  member  of  the  same  in 
1874.  Commenced  practice  in  Montreal,  but  shortly  after  went  to  Dunham.  After 
practicing  for  some  time  in  Dunham  he  returned  to  Montreal,  and  recommenced  i)ro« 
fessional  practice  in  1869.     In  187 1,  he  was  elected  one  of  the   attending  physicians

to  the  Montreal  Dispensary,  afterwards  taking  an  active  part  in  the  management  of 
that  institution  and  becoming  its  Secretary  in  1875.  ^^'^  ^^'^^  ^  member  of  the 
Medico-Chirurgical  Society  of  Montreal,  and  read  severil  papers  at  its  meetings  ; 
also  a  member  of  the  Health  Association,  and  author  of  a  paper  on  the  "  Disposal 
of  Sewerage." 

In  1871,  he  joined  with  others  in  establishing  a  new  Medical  School  which  was 
affiliated  to  the  University  of  Bishop's  College,  Lennoxville,  as  the  Medical  Faculty 
of  that  Institution,  receiving  the  same  year  from  th;'t  University  the  ad  eundem  de- 
gree of  M.D.,  CM.,  and  also  the  degree  of  A.M.  During  the  four  following  sessions 
he  occupied  the  Chair  of  Anatomy,  but  in  Ai)ril,  1875,  having  resigned  that  Chair  he 
was  elected  to  the  Professorsiiip  of  Surgery,  a  position  he  was  eminently  fitted  for, 
as  his  long  acquaintance  with  the  Chair  of  Anatomy  rendered  him  i^roficient  in  that 
branch.     Some  years  ago  he  died  of  consumption  at  an  early  age,  much  regretted. 

COI.ONKL  HOOKER. 
Alfred  Booker,  the  subject  of  this  sketch,  was  born  in  Nottingham,  England,  in 
1824,  consequently  at  tlie  time  of  his  early  death  he  was  only  forty-seven  years  of 
age.  The  family  came  to  Canada  in  1842.  His  father  was  a  Jiaptist  clergyman  of 
Hamilton,  and  lost  his  life  at  the  terrible  Desjardins  Bridge  accident,  (ireat  Western 
Railway,  in  1857,  when  Samuel  Zimmerman,  Alderman  Stuart,  and  many  other  men 
of  note  all  perished.  His  son  commenced  business  in  Hamilton,  and  soon  by  his 
assiduity  and  honesty  attracted  the  confidence  and  patronage  of  the  business  men 
of  Canada. 

It  was,  however,  as  a  devotee  to  the  i)romotion  of  the  volunteer  movement  that 
he  deserves  especial  mention.  No  man  evoked  the  martial  spirit  of  the  young  men 
of  the  old  Gore  District  of  Upper  Canada,  now  Ontario,  more  than  the  late  Colonel 
Booker.  He  organized  the  ist  Battery  of  Volunteer  Artillery  there  in  1853,  and  at 
his  own  expense  bought  two  field-pieces  and  the  whole  accoutrements  for  botli  men 
and  guns.  In  1855,  he  organized  Field  Battery  B.  In  1858,  he  was  gazetted  Lieut. - 
Colonel  commanding  all  the  active  force  of  the  City  of  Hamilton.  He  commanded 
at  Niagara  Falls,  when  he  was  specially  thanked  by  H.  R.  H.  the  Prince  of  Wales, 
and  also  a  general  order  to  that  effect  was  sent  by  the  Governor-General.  In  1864, 
he  visited  England,  and  had  the  high  honor  of  being  presented  to  the  Queen  by  His 
Royal  Highness  the  Prince  of  Wales.  In  1866,  daring  the  Fenian  Raid  at  Ridgeway, 
he  did  his  duty  fully  and  well,  and  although  the  results  of  that  action,  owing  to  the 
slow  movements  of  Colonel  Peacock  and  the  Regulars,  were  not  altogether  such  as 
might  have  been  realized  had  Colonel  Booker  been  promptly  supported  by  Her 
Majesty's  Troops,  nevertheless,  when  an  investigation  took  place  at  his  request,  the 
verdict  was  that  both  his  action  and  conduct  were  entirely  approved  of  by  those  in 
authority.  He  retired  shortly  after  from  the  service,  and  removed  to  Montreal, 
where  he  devoted  his  whole  attention  to  business,  and  to  him  we  may  apply  the 
French  term  that  in  his  business  standing  he  was  "  sans  reproche."  He  died  in 
Montreal  some  years  ago.

Michael  Oiiiniet,  J. P.,  and  was  born  at  St.  Rose,  I'.Q.,  on  .May  301I1,  1848.  His

('ollege,  (Jobouri;,  wliere  he  graduated  in  iiS^g  with  the  degree  of  LL.li.  Having 
(.  hosen  the  Law  as  his  profession,  he  was  called  to  tlie  Oiiebec  Par  in  1S70.  and  lias 
since  pursued  an  cmmently  successful  legal  career,  bemg  now  the  head  of  the  well- 
known  Montreal  firm  of  Ouiniet  &amp;  Emard.  He  was  appointed  a  Queen's  Counsel  in 
iSSo,  when  he  was  also  appniiUed  Ciown  Prosecutor  jointly  with  Mr.  (now  Justice) 
Chas.  P.  Davidson.  'I'hey  hoiU  filled  that  very  important  oltice  with  the  greatest  efficien- 
cy and  honor  until  1887.  Colonel  ( )uimel  has  always  taken  an  active  interest  in  milila. 
ry  affairs,  and  rose  to  the  rank  of  Lieui. -Colonel  of  the  65111  Battalion  Mouni  Royal 
Rifles,  which  he  commanded  during  the  Northwest  Rebellion  of  1885,  His  battalion 
was  in  the  field  in  the  P^dmonton  District,  and  Lieut -Colonel  Ouiniei  rendered 
valuable  service  in  iiacifying  the  Indians  and  prevailing  upon  the  Half-breeds  to 
maintain  their  loyalty  to  llie  Government.  Colonel  (Juiiiiet  has  been  for  the  last 
three  years,  and  is  yet,  Chairman  of  the  Council  of  the  L)ominion  Rifle  Association, 
and  has  always  been  a  warm  friend  of  that  organization.  He  is  interested  in  educa- 
tional work,  and  in  1874  was  appointed  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Roman  Catholic 
School  I'rustces  for  Montreal.  The  parliamentary  e\i)erience  of  Colonel  Ouimet, 
for  a  man  of  his  years,  has  been  remarkably  long  and  succes.sful.  In  October,  1873, 
when  only  twenty-five  years  old,  he  was  returned  to  Parliament,  after  a  fierce  fight 
against  Mr.  L.  O.  David,  one  of  the  brightest  champions  of  the  Liberal  party. 
He  was  re-elected  by  acclamation  at  the  (ieneral  Elections  in  1874,  and  again 
in  1878  and  1887.  He  was  also  returned  in  1891,  and  from  the  13th  of  April, 
1887,10  the  close  of  the  sixth  parliament  in  1891,  he  held  the  honorable  position 
of  Speaker  of  the  House  ofC'ommons,  an  otlice  for  which  his  ability  and  e.xperi- 
ence  amply  fitted  him.  Colonel  Ouimet  possesses  a  wide  knowledge  and  clear  grasp 
of  public  affairs  in  Canada,  and  is  an  able  and  eloquent  speaker.  Still  in  his  prime, 
there  seems  every  reason  to  predict  for  him  a  continued  career  of  eminence  and  use- 
fulness. In  politics  he  is  an  Independent  Conservati\e,  an  advocate  of  provincial 
rights  and  a  strong  protectionist.  Colonel  Ouimet  is  a  director  of  the  Montreal  City 
and  District  Savings  Bank,  and  President  of  the  Laval  Agricultural  Society.  On  May 
30th,  1874,  he  was  united  in  marriage  with  I'heresa,  daughter  of  Alfred  LaRocque, 
Esq.,  of  Montreal,  and  has  now  five  children.  On  the  20th  of  May  last,  1891,  his 
forty-fourth  birthday,  he  was  sworn  a  member  of  Her  Majesty's  Privy  Council." 
When  just  going  to  press  we  find  that  Col.  Ouimet  has  again,  for  the  fourth  time 
been  elected  by  acclamation  to  represent  the  county  of  Laval  in  the  House  of

JEAN  LUKIN  LF.rKOHON,  M.A.,  M.n„C.M., 

Bt)kN  atCluiinbly,  A[)ril  ylh,  iSj.',  is  the  re])resenUUivc  in  Caiuida  of  the  Leprohon 
family,  wliose  anccslur,  Jean  Piiiliiipe  Leprolion,  came  to  Canada  in  1758,  Lieutenant 
in  a  French  Kcginicnt,  and  settled  in  Montreal  after  the  cession  of  the  country  to 
Great  Britain. 

Kdouard  Martial  Leprohon,  the  father  of  Dr.  Leproiion,  served  during  the  War 
of  i8i2j  was  present  at  the  battle  of  (.'hateanguay,  and  was  decorated  later  for 
services  rendered  in  that  action,  llis  wife,  Mane  Louise  Lukin,  was  of  Swiss  descent. 
Her  grandfather  came  to  Canada  shortly  after  the  conquest  as  Secretary  to  one  of 
the  early  English  Governors. 

He  went  through  a  complete  classical  course  in  Nicolel  College,  of  which  estab- 
lishment his  uncle,  the  Rev.  J.  ().  Leprolion,  was  Director  for  a  period  of  thirty 
years.  On  leaviiig  Nicolet  College  Dr.  Leprolion  entered  en  the  study  of  Medicine 
under  Dr.  Holmes,  following  the  lt;ctures  at  Mc(iill  College,  and  graduating  at  that 
Institution  in  May,  1843.  He  Uieii  visited  Europe,  and  remained  abroad  till  the  fall 
of  1845.  On  his  return  he  commenced  practising  his  profession,  and  entered  also  on 
the  publication  of  a  French  medical  periodical  :  La  Lancette  Canadiiiinc.  He  also 
lectured  several  times  on  Hygiene,  the  climate  of  Canada,  etc.,  before  L'lnstitul 
Canadieii.  In  1851,  he  was  married  to  Mi^s  R.  F.  Mullins,  already  known  in  literary 
circles  through  tales  and  seiials  contributed  to  the  Literary  uar/and,  printed  and 
published  by  John  Lovell,  under  the  signature  of  R.  K.  M.  In  1858,  he  represented 
the  St.  Antoine  Ward  in  the  City  Council,  receiving  a  vote  of  thanks  from  that  body 
on  his  retirement  from  office. 

Dr.  Leprohon  has  been  attached  to  the  Montreal  Dispensary  as  Consulting 
Physician  since  1864.  In  1866,  he  was  appointed  with  another  medical  gentleman 
to  report  on  the  sanitary  state  of  Montreal,  and  a  report  was  published  by  them 
embodying  valuable  suggestions  concerning  hygienic  improvements  in  the  city.  In 
1870,  he  received  a  call  to  the  chair  of  Hygiene  in  the  Medical  Department  of 
Bishop's  College.  Dr.  Leprohon  holds  the  honorable  post  of  Vice-Consul  of  Spain 
for  Montreal  since  September,  1871.  He  was  appointed  Justice  of  the  Peace  in 
1851  ;  Surgeon  in  the  loth  Battalion  of  Militia  in  July,  1855;  and  is  one  of  the 
Founders  of  the  Women's  Hospital.  He  was  appointed  by  the  Lieutenant-Governor 
of  the  Province  in  September,  1890,  a  member  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Council  of 
Public  Instruction  for  the  Province  of  Quebec. 

MRS.  LEPROHON. 

A  French  writer — indeed,  the  author  himself  of  "  Histoire  de  la  Littcraturc 
Canadienne^' — says  thus  of  Mrs.  Leprohon  :  "  Les  femmes  qui  se  sont  livrees  aux 
travaux  intellectuels,  parmi  nous,  forment  une  rare  exception.  A  peine,  dans  toute 
la  liste  de  nos  ecrivains,  rencontre-l-on  cpiatre  ou  cinq  noms  feminins.  A  la  tete  de 
ces  exceptions  se  place  Madame  Leprohon."

Mrs.  Leprohon,  better  known  to  the  jiublic  by  licr  maiden  name  of  Miss  R.  K. 
Mullins,  tlic  accomplished  and  talented  authoress,  was  born  in  Montreal,  and  received 
her  education  in  this  city.     At  the  early  age  ot' fourteen,  she  evinced  a  strong  inclina- 
tion for  writing;  and  from  that  time  became  a  steady  contributor,  both  of  |)rose  and 
verse,  to  the  celebrated  JAterary  GarUxnd.     Under  the  initals  of  "  R.  K.  M."  she 
became  speedily  known ;  and  her  pieces  were  invariably  admired  and  received  the 
encomiums  of  all.     Among  the  many  tales  contributed  by  her  to  the  Garland,  none 
were  so  well  received   or  so  popular  as  '■'Ida  Beresford  '  (since  translated  and  pub- 
lished in   French),  "  Florence  Fitz  Ilardinge,'"  and  "  Eva  Huntingdon  " — tales  of 
fiction  and  pathos  of  so  high  a  character,  that  they  may,  without  exaggeration,  he 
ranked  among  those  of  the  same  class,  by  the  best  English  or  American  contributors 
to  the  periodical  press.     She  afterwards  became  enrolled  on  the  staff  of  some  of  the 
American  journals  and  magazines. 

In  i860,  Mrs.  Leprohon  became  connected  with  the  Family  Herald,  and 
whilst  engaged  on  that  paper,  wrote  her  celebrated  tale  of  the  ''  Afanor  House  of  De 
Villerai"  wherein  she  made  it  her  object  to  describe  faithfully  the  manners  and  cus- 
toms of  the  peasantry  or  habitants,  as  they  are  called,  of  Lower  Canada.  It  was  also 
written  to  illustrate  that  period  of  our  hisf.ory  embracing  the  cession  of  Canada  to 
England.  In  all  that  she  purposed,  the  authoress  was  eminently  successful,  and  so 
popular  was  this  work,  that  it  was  translated  into  French,  and  published  in  book 
form.  This  work  has,  according  to  general  opinion,  been  considered  as  the  very 
best  written  on  Canada,  and  adds  another  laurel  to  Mrs.  Leprohon's  well-earned 
fame.  In  the  same  year  she  translated  into  English  the  words  of  the  cantata  of  Mr. 
Sempe,  written  to  commemorate  the  visit  of  the  Prince  of  Wales,  sung  before  His 
Royal  Highness,  whilst  in  Montreal,  by  the  Oratorio  .Society  of  that  city. 

Mrs.  Leprohon  was  also  a  very  superior  musical  artiste  awd  linguist,  endowed  with 
great  general  abilities  and  accomplishments.  She  died  some  years  ago.  We  append 
to  this  short  sketch  her  poem  on  the  two  old  towers  of  the  Grand  Seminary,  and  are 
happy  to  be  able  to  give  a  place  in  this  Gazetteer  to  one  so  talented  and  at  the 
same  time  a  native  of  Montreal. 

THE  OLD  TOWERS. 

On  the  eastern  slope  of  Mount  Royal's  side, 

In  view  of  St.  Lawrence'  silvery  tide. 

Are  two  stone  towers  of  masonry  rude. 

With  massive  doors  of  time-darkened  wood  ; 

Traces  of  loop-holes  still  show  in  the  walls, 

Whilst  softly  across  them  the  sunlight  falls  ; 

Around,  stretch  broad  meadows,  quiet  and  green  '~' 

Where  cattle  graze — a  fair,  tranquil  scene. 


208  GAZETTEER   OF   MONTREAL. 

Those  old  towers  tell  of  a  time  long  jiast 
When  the  Red  man  roamed  o'er  these  regions  vast, 
And  the  settlers — men  of  hold  heart  and  brow, 
Had  to  use  the  sword  as  well  as  the  plough  : 
When  women,  no  lovelier  now  than  then, 
Had  to  do  the  deeds  of  undaunted  men. 
And  had  higher  aims  for  each  true  warm  heart 
Than  study  of  fashion's  or  toilet's  art. 


It  was  in  those  towers — the  southern  one — 
Sister  Margaret  Bourgeois,  that  sainted  Nun, 
Sat  patiently  teaching,  day  after  day, 
How  to  find  Jesus — The  Blessed  Way, 
'Mid  the  daughters  swarth  of  the  forest  dell, 
Who  first  from  her  (jf  a  God  heard  tell  ; 
And  learned  the  virtues  that  woman  should  grace, 
Whatever  might  be  her  rank  or  iier  race. 

Here,  too,  in  the  chapel  tower  buried  deep, 
An  Indian  brave  and  his  grandchild  sleep, 
True  model  of  womanly  virtues — she — 
Acquired  at  Margaret  Bourgeois'  knee  ; 
He,  won  unto  Christ  from  his  own  dark  creed, 
From  the  trammels  fierce  of  his  childhood  freed, 
Lowly  humbled  his  savage  Huron  pride 
And  amid  the  pale  faces  lived  and  died. 

With  each  added  year  grows  our  city  fair  ; 

Churches  rich,  lofty,  and  spacious  square. 

Villas  and  mansions  of  stately  pride, 

Enibciiish  it  now  on  every  side  ; 

Buildings — old  landmarks — vanish  each  day, 

For  stately  successors  to  quick  make  way ; 

But  ive  pray  from  change  time  may  long  leave  free 

The  ancient  towers  of  Ville  Mat  ie  !

HON.  KDWAKI)  Ml'Rl'IIY. 


Hon.  I'Idwari)  MiRriiv  was  ciiUcil  to  the  SciiiUo  by  Orclor  in  Council,  May  30th, 
aiul  ^j;i/,ellcd  June  6lh,  1889,  as  rc|»rcsciUativc  fur  the  division  of  Vicloria,  in 
succession  to  tlie  late  Hon.  Tlionias  Kyan.  Mr.  Murphy  was  born  in  IJallyeilcn, 
County  Carlow,  Ireland,  on  the  sfith  July,  1818.  His  family  were  for  over  a  cen- 
tury extensive  mill  owners  anil  corn  merchants  in  the  County  Carlow.  Mr.  Murphy 
claims  lineage  from  Donald  Jfor,  a  Chieftain  of  considerable  power  and  territory  in 
the  County  ^Vexford,  dating  back  to  the  reigns  of  Henry  VHI  and  ICdward  \'I, 
uiuKr  whom  the  major  part  of  his  estates  were  confiscated  to  the  Crown.  His 
mother  was  a  descendant  of  the  old  distinguished  family  of  the  O'Uyrncs,  of  (!ounty 
AVicklow  ;  he  is  related  to  the  Ivavanaghs,  Rudkins,  iMtzgeralds,  Motleys,  iJutlers  and 
other  families  of  position  in  the  east  and  south  of  Ireland.  Mr.  Murphy  was  twice 
married  :  first,  in  1848,  to  Miss  McJJride,  of  Dublin;  and  secondly  to  Miss  Power, 
second  daughter  of  the  late  Hon.  William  Power,  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court  of 
(Quebec,  and  of  Susannc  de  (laspe,  his  wife  (daughter  of  the  late  Philippe  Aubert  de 
Oaspe,  seigneur  of  St.  Jean  Port  Job,  author  o(  Lrs  AncleiisCaiuuiicns  and  other  works 
on  Canailian  History).  Mr.  Murphy  has  never  from  his  earlier  manhood  sought  to 
hide  his  firmly  grounded  opinions  respecting  the  various  political,  religious  and  social 
(piestiijiis  which  are  being  discussed  around  him,  yet  he  has  at  all  times  made  his  con- 
victions known,  his  iniluencc  felt,  and  his  generosity  of  heart  manifest  in  so  worthy 
a  manner  that,  wlien  at  last  an  honorable  reward  came  to  him  for  long  years  of 
service  to  Crown  and  country,  there  is  in  all  Canada  to-day  no  pen  to  write  or  voice 
to  utter  a  word  other  than  in  unqualified  praise.  In  a  word,  we  may  say  that  he 
possesses  to  an  extraordinary  degree  the  goodwill,  the  respect  and  even  the  affec- 
tion of  all  classes  of  the  community.  In  business  his  word  is  as  good  as  his  bond, 
and  in  politics  he  has  been  a  sincere  and  steadfast  supporter  of  the  Liberal-Conser- 
vative parly.  Mr.  Murphy,  while  being  a  devout  adherent  of  the  Church  of  his 
fathers,  has  never  allowed  his  generous  impulses  to  rest  exclusively  within  the  pale 
of  his  own  denomination,  and  consequently  he  has  been  recognized  by  all  races  and 
creeds  as  a  true-hearted,  faithful.  Christian  gentleman.  His  devotion  to  the  cause  of 
the  land  of  his  birth  has  been  never  known  to  firil,  and  a  representative  Irish  Cana- 
dian in  every  sense  of  the  word  now  sits  for  the  \'icloria  division  in  the  Canadian 
Senate. 

Mr.  Murphy  with  his  parents  came  to  Montreal  in  1824,  where  he  has  since 
resided.  He  was  i)ut  to  commercial  business  at  the  early  age  of  fourteen  years,  and 
from  being  a  salesman  in  the  extensive  wholesale  hardware  lirm  of  Frolhingham  &amp; 
Workman,  he  became  in  1859  a  partner  in  the  concern,  and  is  to-day  one  of  the 
senior  members  of  that  great  establishment.  Mr.  Murphy's  connection  with  St. 
Pa^'ick's  Church  of  this  city  dates  back  from  its  foundation,  and  the  influence  for 
good  which  he  has  exercised  over  his  co-religionists  and  compatriots  can  never  be 
too  highly  appreciated.

Prize,"  of  the  annual  value  of  $100  in  perpetuity,  for  *•  the  encouragement  of 
commercial  education  in  Montreal,"  open  to  all,  has  done  much  to  stimulate  our 
youths  to  In'gher  excellence  in  commercial  pursuits.

He  has  been  for  many  years  a  Life  Governor  of  the  Montreal  General  Hosjjital  and

He  received  his  early  echication  at   Masson   College,  ami  when  his  «()iirsc  ended  lie 
entered  the  Seminary  of  Nicolet.     lie  afterwards  (hose  Law  as  his  profc  sion,  and 
commenced  his  studies  in  the  olttee  of  Wilfred  I'rovost,  sui)se(Hienlly  studying,'  in  the 
ofHce  of  Messrs.  Kabrc,  F.esage  iV  Jette,  of  Montreal.     He  was  called  to  the  Har  in 
tS(i2,  and  began  the  practice  of  his  profession,  which  he  continned   until  18^)7,  Init 
seeing  at  this  time  a  brighter  field   in  journalism,  he  relinquished  ''  Mia.  kslone"  for 
the  pen,  and  became  one  of  the  associate  editors  of  //O/Jir,  where  his  pungent  pen 
will  long  be  remembered  l)y  its  readers.     Kor  some  four  years  he   reiniincd  with 
/.'On/rg,  at  the  conclusion  of  which  he  accepted  the  editorship  of  f.i-  A'ouvtait  Momicy 
which  position  he  held  from  1S72  to  1H78,  and  which  paper  like  its  bril!.;  nt  editor  was 
Faberal-Conservative.     In  every  senlenc.'  that   it   utiered   there   was  .111  independeiil 
ring,  and  it  is  due  to  Mr.  Desjardins  to  say  that  his  pen  was  largely  instrumental  in 
infusing  courage,  life  and  ambition  into  his  political  confrtJres.     He  was  firsl  elected 
to  Parliament  by  acclamation  at  the  General  Elections  of  1S74,  and  was  reelected  in 
1S7.S,   i88i,    1S.S7   and    1H91.     Ik'ing  a  comprehensive  and  convincing  speaker,  he 
always  conmiands  the  attention  of  the   House.     His  speeches  favoring  the  construc- 
tion  of  the  Canadian    PacilU:    Railroad,  also  urging   an  anniesty  to   Kiel  at'ter  the 
Rebellion  of  1870-71,   showed  marked  ability.      He  is  a  believer  in  separate  schoo's, 
and  warmly  co-operated  with   Mr.  Cosligan  in  his  exertions  to  have  the  Free  School 
Law,  passed  by  the  New  Brunswick   Legislature,  repealed.     Rtf.  Desjardins  retired 
from  journalism  in  1879,  and  accepted  the  presidency  of  the  Jacques  Cartier  I'.ank, 
which  position  he  still  ably  fills.     After  his  return  in   1872  from  a  visit  to  Rome, 
where  he  had  the  honor  of  being  admitted  to  an  auilietice  with  His  Holiness,  he  was 
created  a   Knight  of  the  Order  of  Pius  IX.     He  had  taken  an  active  part  in  the 
organization  of  the  Canadian  I'apal  Zouave  contingent  which  went  to  the  assistance 
of  the   Holy  Father  in    1S68.     He  was   one  of  the   authors   of  the    "Programme 
Catholifiue,"  first  published  in  April,  1871,  which  was  prepared  for  the  purjjose  of 
being  offered  to  the  Conservative  party  as  a  basis  on  which  the  several  opposing 
sections  of  that  party  might  agree.     In  1882,  Mr.  Desjardins  was  elected  President 
of  "  Le  Credit   Foncier  du  JJas  Canada,"  and   in   1883  became  a  director  of  the 
Richelieu  and  Ontario  Navigation  Co.    In  July,  1887,  he  was  elected  Vice-President 
of  the  Montreal  and  Weslern    Railway  Co.,  a  line  now  being  built  from  St.  Jerome 
terminus  of  a  branch  of  the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway  to  the  Desert,  where  it  will 
cross  the  Gatineau  Valley  Railroad,  and  thence  run  westerly  through  the  Ottawa 
Valley  region.     He  has  always  taken  an  active  interest  in  the  development  of  the 
commercial  relations  between  Canada,  France  and  Central  Europe.     He  has  been 
chairman  of  a   committee  of  business  men  selected  to  study  and  promote  such  a 
policy,  and  open  new  markets  to  the  industries  and  resources  of  Canada."

WILLIAM  MOLSON, 


WiiosK  name  is  so  prominently  conneclcd  with  tlic  rise  and  progress  of  Montreal, 
and  indeed  of  Canada,  was  of  J'!nglish  descent.  Hon.  John  .Nfolson,  his  fallier,  visited 
Canada  in  1782,  and  was  so  much  jileased  with  the  country  that  he  decided  to  settle, 
and  two  years  after  returned  to  England,  raised  a  considerable  sum  of  money  on  his 
English  estate,  and  cime  back.  Me  was  a  member  of  the  JCxeculive  Council  of  Lower 
Canada  in  1836,  and  died  at  the  age  of  seventy-two,  leaving  three  sons,  John, 
Thomas  and  Williau).  The  youngest  was  connected  with  most  of  the  enterprises  for 
the  advancement  of  the  country,  and  took  an  active  part  in  furthering  them.  He  was  a 
(Irand  Trimk  Railway  Director.  In  1853,  he  retired  from  the  Board  of  Directors  of 
the  J5ank  of  Montreal,  and  with  Hon,  John  Molson,  his  brother,  established  Molsons 
Bank  under  the  free  lianking  Act.  In  1855,  ^'"^  institution  obtained  a  Charter,  and 
their  brother  Thomas  became  a  sharehcjlder  in  it.  He  was  liighly  conservative  in  his 
views,  and  frcfiuenlly  refused  to  enter  i)ublic  life,  preferring  to  carry  out  important 
enterprises  lending  to  the  advancement  of  his  country.  He  took  part  with  other 
loyal  men  in  suppressing  the  Rebellion  of  1S37,  but  strongly  objected  to  the  i)assage 
of  the  Act  of  1849  against  the  Rebels,  and  signed  the  Annexation  manifesto.  He 
was  then  deprived  of  his  commission  of  Justice  of  the  Peace,  and  also  his  position  in 
the  Militia  ;  and  though,  afterwards,  the  ( jovernment  sought  to  make  amends,  he 
persistently  declined  reinstatement  in  office,  considering  he  had  been  unjustly  dealt 
with. 

As  a  private  citizen  he  was  highly  esteemed,  there  being  scarcely  any  educa- 
tional or  charitable  institution  in  the  city  which  did  not  experience  his  beneficence. 
He  was  a  member  of  the  Senate  of  McGill  College,  and  selected  that  seat  of  learning 
as  one  of  the  almoners  of  his  bounty.  It  thus  happens  that  the  name  of  Afolson  is 
associated  with  McCJill  on  the  honor  roll  of  the  University.  Deceased  built  the 
Library,  Convocation  Hall,  corridors  and  class-rooms,  in  honor  of  which,  one  wing 
of  the  University  bears  the  name  of  William  ]\[olson  Hall.  The  stone  tower  and 
spire  of  Trinity  Church  has  associated  with  it  the  name  of  Molson.  It  was  erected  by 
him,  at  the  request  of  his  wife,  in  the  interest  of  Religion,  and  to  the  memory  of  his 
only  son,  who  died  in  1843,  ^t  twenty-one  years  of  age.  Mr.  Molson  never  forgot  the 
sick  or  poor.  He  gave  $5,000  towards  the  Montreal  General  Hospital,  and  with  others 
established  the  House  of  Refuge.  He  gave  $2,000  towards  the  erection  of  a  con- 
valescent hospital  in  connection  with  the  General  Hospital.  He  also  joined  with 
his  brothers  in  endowing  an  English  Literary  Chair  in  McGill.  He  was  President  of 
the  (ieneral  Hospital  at  the  time  of  his  death,  and  also  held  the  same  position  in  the 
Bank  which  bears  his  family  name.  His  two  married  daughters  are  Mrs.  D.  L. 
Macpherson  and  Mrs.  John  Molson.  His  acts  were  those  of  a  good  man,  and  his 
deeds  will  long  be  held  in  loving  remembrance  by  his  fellow  citizens.

HON.  SAMUKl,  COkWVAI.l.IS  MON'K.  1,1,1). 

To  ')L'^iii  ;il  the  l)cgiiiiiing  i)f  this  wc'll-known  ami  impnrtant  family  who  have  hi't-n 
so  prominent  in  the  annals  of  [.owcr  Canada,  we  must  ^o  hack  l(j  the  early  days  of 
last  ceniiiry.  '{'he  family  of  the  late  jiidLje  Monk,  the  subject  of  this  sketch,  came 
from  Devonshire.  I'^iigland — a  county  that  has,  with  its  conligiious  one,  Cornwall, 
])ro(liice(l  many  emiiuiU  men  in  literature,  art,  and  science,  in  the  Church,  liar  and 
Senate,  'i'hey  come  from  an  old  Norman  family,  the  name  having  originally  been 
Moviie  or  r,e  Moine. 

We  fust  lind  trace  of  the  family  ni  lioslon — not  then  "'The  Hub,"  but  a  small 
English  town  during  the  days  before  the  War  of  Independence,  James  .Monk,  of 
this  time,  married  in  Jjoston  an  Ann  Dering,  a,  daughter  of  the  well-known  Henry 
Dering.  After  having  taken  part  in  the  expedition  against  LouisbiM'g,  then  held  by 
!•' ranee,  he  received  a  grant  of  land  in  Nova  Scotia,  and  going  there,  settled  near 
Halif.ix,  where  he  died.  He  had  three  sons,  James.  Hi'tiry  and  Charles.  The  oldest 
afterwards  became  Sir  James  Monk,  Chief  Justice  of  .Montreal.  We  find  his  name 
at  the  opening  of  the  first  Coml  of  King's  liench  on  the  ist  September,  1S02.  'i'he 
judges  then  present  were  "Chief  Justice  Monk.  Mr.  Justice  I'anet,  and  Mr.  Justice 
Davidson."  'I"hc  second  son,  (leorge  Henry,  after  having  been  a  naval  officer, 
became  a  Juilge  in  Nova  Scotia.  The  thinl,  Charles,  went  to  live  in  I'jigl.ind,  and 
became  the  father  of  James  Henry  M(jnk,  at  one  lime  Dean  of  I'eterboro,  and 
afterwards  iJishop  of  (doiicester  and  IJristol. 

(leorge  Henry  Monk  married  a  Miss  Gould,  a  niece  of  dovernor  ]5enning  Went 
worth.  His  son,  at  an  early  age,  became  rrolhonolary  of  Montreal.  This  was  by 
the  influence  of  his  uncle,  Chief  Justice  Sir  James  Monk. 

Samuel  Went  worth  XTonk  had  an  only  son,  Samuel  Cornwallis  Monk.  The  subject 
of  our  present  sketch  was  born  at  Windsor,  Nova  Scotia,  on  the  29th  of  July,  1S14. 
He  was  educated  at  Windsor,  and  subsetiuently  entered  Trinity  College,  Dublin. 
Arriving  in  Canada  in  1831,  he  commenced  immediately  the  study  of  Law,  and  was 
admitted  to  the  Bar  of  J^ower  Canada  in  the  midst  of  revohilion  and  rebellion,  viz., 
in  iS,37.  For  the  next  two  years  he  made  a  lour  of  J'-urope,  thereby  saving  himself 
from  either  side  of  the  political  volcano,  which,  during  1837  and  1838,  raged  through- 
out tne  Province.  (Jn  his  return  to  Montreal  he  entered  into  partnership  widi  the 
late  Sir  John  Rose.  He  was  made  a  ().C.  in  1854,  and  for  some  years  represented 
the  Attorney  Ceneral  of  Lower  Canada  as  Crown  Trosecutor.  In  1859,  he  was 
raised  to  the  liench  of  the  Superior  Court  of  Lower  Canada,  When  the  well-known 
Mr.  Justice  Aylwin  retired  in  1868  from  the  Queen's  Bench,  the  subject  of  this

laud;ilile  object  by  his  elder  brother,  who  hail  in  Scot  hiiiil  been  educated  lor  the 
Scottish  liar,  he  rendered  Alexander  every  assistance  in  his  power,  -eeiiii^  thai  his 
brother  bent  his  mind  on  ihe  leyal  profession.  When  sivteeii  years  ol  age  he  came 
to  Montreal  ;'.iul  entered  as  a  i)upil  the  Montreal  College  at  the  time  the  cele- 
brated Rebellion  broke  out. 

Indge  ("n.ss  slmlied  i,aw  with  jchn  J.  Day.  lie  also  enlisted  a,s  a  volunteer  in 
Col.  Mailland's  iSattalion,  and  served  ihrouglioul  the  npiisin:;,  retiring  with  the  rank 
of  Sergeant.  '1  lii-^  is  a  differeiil  title  to  thai  ol'  Sergeant  in  the  London  i,aw

the  CMerk  of  the  Cmnicii  of  the  Couniy  of  lieauharnois.  So  weil  did  he  aiteud  lo 
the  duties  of  this  situation  that  i,ord  Selkirk  and  others  who  had  sia\edai  the  Manor 
House  lo  see  its  workings,  complimented  him  on  the  abilities  which  he  ilisplaye'd. 
Hewas  called  to  the  liar  in  1S44,  anil  was  in  practice  in  Montreal,  fu'st  with  Dun- 
can Fisher,  (J&gt;.C.,and  afterwards  with  James  Smith,  (J.C.,  late  .\tlorney  (leiieral  and 
Judge  of  the  Sui)erior  Court.  He  was  made  (^.C.  in  1864.  I  must  mention  here,  and 
taken  from  the  second  vol.  of  '"  Men  of  Progress,"  published  in  New  Vork  that  al 
the  burning  of  the  rarliamenl  House  of  Montreal  in  1.S49,  the  subject  of  this  sketch 
was  then  present,  and  assisted  the  late  Sir  Louis  Lafontaine  and  some  others  of  ihe 
notable  politicians  in  making  their  escape  from  the  burning  biiildings,  escorting  them 
unmolested  through  the  turbulent  crowd  of  rioters,  among  whom  he  exercised  an 
amount  of  influence." 

He  was  raised  to  th^  Queen's  Bench,  30th  August,  1877,  where  he  has  continued 
ever  since  one  of  its  brightest  ornaments.  He  seems  all  his  life  to  have  had  a  great 
aversion  to  publicity.  When  a  young  man  he  was  more  than  once  offered  positioiis 
of  public  trust,  but  always  refused. 

In  1848,  he  married  Julia,  a  daughter  of  William  Lunn  and  sister  of  Mr.  Lunn, 
the  well-known  advocate,  of  the  firm  of  Lunn  &amp;  C.;ramp.

His  father  was  a  teacher  of  celebrity  in  the  County  of  Suffolk,  England.  Mis  father's 
sudden  death  caused  his  removal  from  school,  and  at  the  early  age  f)f  fitteeii  he 
commenced  his  educational  career,  afterwards  hokling  the  Classical  and  Mercantile 
chairs  in  lUiry,  Si.  Edmunds,  Stanton,  St.  John,  and  Cavendish  Grammar  School,  in 
his  native  county.  He  then  tilled  high  positions  in  the  large  private  schools  in  the 
vicinity  of  London,  viz.,  I&gt;arnes,  Willesden,  and  Kensington.  The  head  classical 
assistant  maslershii)  in  the  Royal  Reading  Grammar  School  falling  vacant,  he  became 
an  applicant,  and,  after  a  severe  examination,  was  successful  in  obtaining  the  appoint-

famous  school  that  he  became  connected  with  the  College  of  Preceptors,  and  whose 
Licentiate's  Diploma  he  obtained  in  1852.  After  his  departure  from  Reading,  he

ClIAKLI  S  AI.i:.\AM&gt;r.K.  M  I'.l  .,  J. P., 

Was  l)«»rn  in  I  )iiik1cc.  Scotland,  and  left  it  with  \\h  wii  and  xon  on  tlic  .sih  of  April, 
iH.|o,  .Mid  III)  the  51I1  of  May  following'  he  was  shipwrecked  in  tlu-  ntiildle  nt'  the 
night  at  Torl)ay,  einhieen  miles  nf)rtheaHl  of  St.  John's,  NewlDiniill.uid,  with  all  the 
p.ii&gt;&lt;enj,'ers,  and  the  loss  of  eviryihing.  He  was  safely  pulled  up  .1  hij;li  rock  .iiid 
on  to  the  main  land,  with  llu-  others,  and  llui&lt;  saved. 

After  siil'fi'ring  miieh  privation,  without  lood  ;md  clothes  for  two  days,  womtn 
and  children,  they  pushed  on  to  Si.  John's,  wlure  the  iioMe  SioN  hiniii  of  that  place 
lodged  them,  and  provided  necdiiil  clothing  .mil  other  ne(  ess. iries.  When  (tpportmiity 
offered  they  wiTe  sent  by  ship  onwards  to  Montu'al.  They  l.uided  in  July,  aiul  Mr. 
Ale.x.inder  had  work  at  once  in  Mr.  KeilU'r's  confectionery  store. 

I  Living  l«t-.t  all  their  effects  hy  the  shipwreck,  the  first  winter  wan  a  h.ird  one  to 
the  yoinig  people,  and  needed  all  the  economy  both  could  e.xercise. 

"( )ur  Inst  dmy,"  says  Mr.  Alexander  in  another  memoir,  "after  being  settled, 
was  to  seek  &lt;  hurch-fellowship.  ( )ur  Utters  to  Rev.  Dr.  Wilkes,  from  our  church  in 
Dundee,  with  all  else,  had  been  lost,  with  our  hard  earnings  brought  frmn  home  ;  b\it 
we  did  not  need  a  letter.  We  were  one  with  the  brethren  then  worshipping  in  old 
St.  Maurice  Street  Church." 

In  1S41,  Mr.  Alexander  started  business  in  London,  C  W.  ;  but  after  nine 
months  he  canje  back  to  Montreal,  as  the  town  of  I,on(h)n  was  then  too  small  for 
two  confectioners,  where  he  worked  hard  imlil  the  next  year.  A  church  member 
then  gave  him  the  loan  of  sufticient  money  to  start  himself. 

Making  all  necessary  arrangenienis,  he  began  business  in  September,  1842.  in 
Mcdill  street,  at  a  rent  of  C 100.  He  rented  the  ujiper  part  for  £60  and  slept  behind 
the  .shop  and  thus  saved  all  he  could.  The  bakehouse  was  in  the  cellar.  '*  Saving 
and  toiling  early  and  late,  Our  l'"alher  blessed  us,  and  we  got  on  ])rosperously." 

After  some  two  or  three  years,  he  paid  off  what  was  borrowed,  then  went  ahead 
fast  until  the  small  i)rcmiscs  were  now  too  confined,  and  he  moved  to  Notre  Dame 
street. 

He  then  look  hold,  with  others,  of  the  St.  Andrew's  Society — was  a  life  member 
for  some  years  on  its  Committee  and  its  Charitable  Fund.  After  several  private  efforts 
and  beginnings  a  soup  kitchen  for  suffering  I'oor  was  commenced,  and,  after  many 
conferences,  a  charter  was  obtained  and  the  Protestant  House  0/  Industry  -uuis 
estabiislu'd  \\\  1S65.  This  was  for  respectable  friendless  Protestant  poor  as  perma- 
nent inmates,  also  for  a  night  refuge  for  any  poor  wanderer. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  at  its  beginning,  and  subscribed  a  good  sum  to 
help  it.  He  has  been  connected  with  it  ever  since,  and  for  the  past  twelve  years  its 
President.     As  a  blessing  to  the  community  its  annual  reports  speak  for  themselves. 

To  the  noble  and  useful  Institution,  the  General  Hospital,  he  became  a  Life 
Governor  some  twenty-seven  years  ago,  and  on  its  Board  of  Management  almost 
ever  since.  Ha^  been  the  Secretary  to  the  Board,  Treasurer  and  Vice-President ;  but 
resigned  this  position,  and  is  still  on  the  Management.

While  ill  the  (.'oiineil  his  atteiilion,  fioni  frei|iieiil  visits  to  the  cominoii  gaol, 
w.is  directed  to  a  sl.itc  of  thiiii;'.  diere  thai  pained  him  iiiueh.  Hi'  saw  "very 
small  and  yoinig  boys  in  the  prison  yard,  as  a  piinishineiil,  hre.ddng  stones,  and  lh.it 
side  by  side  with  old  offenders.  There  could  be  no  hop'j  of  these  po(jr  boys  being 
maile  morally  l)elter  l)y  sii&lt;;li  ireatimnl  as  this." 

llel)ronght  this  (jiiestioii  time  and  again  bel'ore  the  (Council  as  to  a  remedy, 
lie  wrote  to  the  I'ress,  the  judges  on  tlie  lieiie.h,  and  th(;  I'oliee  Magistrates.  .\ll 
these  endorsed  his  views.  At  last  the  movement  took  sh.i|)e,  when  the  Rev.  y\bbe 
Kams.iy  '.ind  .Mr.  Alex.ander  agree&lt;l  that  the  remedy  toiild  be  found  in  llu;  passage  of 
an  Act  (founded  on  the  Imperial  .\&lt;:t)  to  be  entitled  "  Reformatory  and  Industrial 
.School  Act." 

'I"o  press  this  on  the  Dominion  rarliameiil,  .\bbe  Ramsay  ;ind  he  went  tog(;ther 
to  Sir  John  Macdonald,  and  in  due  time  it  !)ccame  law. 

In  his  visits  to  llu;  gaol,  he  s.iw  women  who  were  there  for  slight  offences  silting 
in  a  circle,  teasing  oakum,  their  chief  cinploymeiit  as  labor,  ycjiing  and  old  together, 
and  lu-  asked  himself  tlie  f[iiesti(jn,  "  How  c(.iuld  reformation  be  ex])eeted  under  such 
a  stale  of  things?"  'I'o  reni'dy  this  he  v/rote  of  the  matter  •&lt;)  the  I'ress  and  to 
inlluenlial  men  to  have  a  ri'inedy  provided,  in  (jrder  that  poor  women  might  have 
di:ciiil  oc«aipalion  and  such  as  might  give  hope  of  reformation  after  their  return  to 
society  again. 

In  the  CJouncil  he  gave  them  no  rest,  and  at  last  got  an  open  letter  from  the 
Mayor  to  introduce  him  to  lioston  city  aulhorilits  .ind  New  York, 

He  visited  tjiese  cities  .and  many  of  their  institutions  for  women,  and  was  shewn 
great  attention,  especially  at  IJoston,  wlure  the  Aldermen  shewed  the  work  which 
they  had  done  for  fallen  women.  They  afterwards  took  him  down  their  harbor  in  a 
steamer  to  see  their  Inslilulion  for  iJoys  Reformatory,  built  cmi  an  island. 

Again,  Mr.  AlexandeV  (luaintly  writes  in  .ajiposition  of  other  journeys  taken  by  the 
Dominion  and  Local  officials  for  the  same  or  other  [Jiirpcjses  ; — "  'J'/ic  lo/io/e  journey 
7uas  taken  at  my  own  cost  and  (-/laif^cs." 

On  his  return  he  rei)orted  the  result  to  the  City  Council,  wliich  was  kindly 
received.     The  (Jouncil  was  then  forced  to  see  to  the  matter. 

The  result  of  all  was  that  the  City  Council  voted  $25,000  to  .aid  in  the  erection 
of  suitable  buildings  for  a  l''emale  (iaol. 

This  (luestion  had   to  be  lobbied  through  tlie  rrovincial  Parliament,  and  to  aid

Something  had  to  be  doiu-  for  those  who  had  no  homes. 

The  matter  then  took  shape.  Mr.  Alexander  said  he  would  build  a  suil,d)lc 
house.  Aiiolliir,  J.  Ilaylis,  said  he  wcjuld  givi-ihe  land.  'I'liiis  arose  the  JJoys'  ll(jme 
in  Mountain  street. 

In  \H(i(),  a  mei'img  of  cili/ciis  was  held  to  cue  for  the  deaf  and  dumb  of  our

ami  others  who  liavi:  since  died,  desired  to  begin  the  work.  Mr.  (.'ramp  collected 
(|uite  a  sum  of  money.  A  locality  was  bought  in  Cote  .St.  Antoine,  and  the  work 
begun.  .Mr.  .Mexander  was  i'resideut;  !'.  McKenzie,  .Secretary-'lVeasurcr,  with  a 
good  (  (unmitlie  of  men  and  women. 

I'or  six  years  it  kept  on  under  much  discouragement,  until  Joseph  Mackay  built 
the  iiistilution  further  out  on  Cote  .St.  Antoine.  Then,  (Jii  the  opem'ng  by  Lord 
l)uirerin,  ..Mr.  Alexander  retired  from  being  I'resideut,  but  is  still  closely  identified 
with  the  work. 

Probably  ih  .ill  the  public  efforts  of  the  subject  of  this  memoir,  none  cost 
him  more  aiixiel)  Irom  the  first  inception  until  this  present  time  than  that  of  the 
beginning  and  ( (jiitinuiiig  of  the  great  work  of  the  I'roteslant  Ilosjiital  for  the 
Insane,  'i'liis  Institution  is  now,  it  is  to  be  hoped,  settled  on  a  linn  basis,  and  its 
valuable  benelils  spread  far  and  near. 

I'or  many  years  .Mr.  .Alexander  has  been  an  active  helper  in  the  .Society  for 
I'reveiition  of  (Jruelly  to  Anim.ds  and  is  now  the  ['resident.  It  employs  two 
Inspectors — one  for  the  Ivisl  and  another  for  the  West  (jf  the  city.  I.olli  these  men

.\lr.  Alexander  was  at  the  lirsl  meeting  several  years  ago  of  the  .Society  for  the 
Prevention  of  Cruelty  to  Women  and  (."hihlreii,  and  is  still  an  active  member  (jf  the 
Society.  It  is  d(jing  a  good  work  ;  has  an  earnest  agent  ilaily  employed  hearing 
compl.iints  and  trying  to  remedy  them. 

Whatever  the  subject  of  this  sketch  has  done  in  any  hmnble  way  since  he  has 
jjeen  in  this  city,  he  attributes  all  U)  the  goodness  of  God,  who  has  [)ul  it  in  his  heart 
to  do  so,  and  given  him  grace  and  strength  and  time  for  such  W(jrk.

iiarclay,  a-&lt;kiiig  him  to  come  to  (,'aiiada  and  take  charge  of  this  church,  which  he 
consented  to  do,  and  was  inducted  as  its  minister  on  the  1  1  th  of  October,  iHS,^. 
Since  then  his  ministry  in  .Montreal  has  been  eminently  successful,  and  his  inllui'iice 
among  the  young  men  of  that  city  is  greatly  marked,  so  much  so  that  they  lh)ck  to 
his  church  in  great  numbers,  and  regard  him  in  a  special  sense  as  their  friend.  'i"he 
Rev.  Mr.  Barclay  has  great  mental  qualities,  is  an  independi'iil  thinker,  and  never 
hesitates  to  i.-nunciate'  the  scieiitilic  and  theological  thoughts  of  the  times  we  live 
in.  His  sermons  are-  prepared  with  great  care,  and  are  delivered  with  earnest- 
ness and  force.  He  is  a  good  reader,  and  an  impressive  i)latform  speaker.  IMiysically 
the  Rev.  .Nfr.  Jiarclay  is  tall  and  muscular,  giving  one  an  idea  of  strength  and  power. 
He  belongs  to  the  Charles  Kingsley  school,  and  is  a  lover  of  outdoor  pastimes  and 
s]ji&gt;rts,  a  champion  crii  keter  and  golf  player,  and  a  gieat  admirer  of  the  "  roaring 
game" — curling.  'I'he  Edinburgh  .S'tt^/.vw^ir// has  spoken  of  him  as  being  the  best  all 
round  cricketer  in  Scotland,  and  a  terrifically  fast  bowler  who  has  won  victory  after 
victory  for  the  West  of  Scotlatid.  He  was  captain  of  the  Glasgow  University  cricket 
and  football  clubs  for  some  years,  and  also  cai)lain  of  the  "  (lentlemen  of  Scotland." 
We  are  glad  that  in  this  matter  of  out-door  recreation,  and  also  in  some  other  matters, 
he  has  shown  the  courage  of  his  convi'tions,  and  we  do  not  think  he  has  lost  any- 
thing by  it.  I'here  is  such  a  thing  as  being  too  professional  and  too  jjriestly,  and 
there  can  be  little  doubt  but  that  this  has  done  its  full  share  in  creating  the  somewhat 
genera!  prejudice  that  exists  among  young  men  against  religion.  'I'his  popular  divine 
has  been  honored  by  being  called  on  to  preach  before  (^ueen  Victoria  on  several 
occasions,  and  he  stands  high  in  Her  Majesty's  estimation  as  an  expounder  of  the 
Gospel  of  Christ.  The  congregation  of  St.  Paul's  Church  is  large  and  influential.  Jts 
ministers   have  always  been   men  of  commanding  intellect  and  gentlemanly  bearing,

York  and  imnu'dialely  came  to  .Montreal,  where  lu;  had  been  given  up  as  lost  by  all 
but  his  wife.  In  nS^i,  he  went  to  (,)uebec  as  Inspector  of  .Ashes,  and  was  subsequently 
macU'  manager  there  of  tin;  Towboat  (Company,  rt'laining  liis  place  as  lnspe&lt;;lor.  In 
1S33,  he  was  appoii.led  Lieutenant  and  Adjutant  of  tlu;  (lariison  .Artillery.  In  1S.35, 
in  addition  to  his  other  ai)poiiitmenls,  he  received  the  position  of  Manager  of  the  St. 
I.awr  'lice  Steamboat  Company.  .At  the  outbreak,  in  1X37,  of  the  political  troubles 
he  raised  the  (,'ompany  of  (Ireiiadiers  in  twenty-four  hours  .after  llie  order  had  issued 
to  raise  a  regiment  oi  a  thous.md  strong,  "  The  J&gt;oyal  (Quebec  Volunlceis,"  and  thus 
became  senior  officer.  'The  rebellion  having  been  appaiently  (pielled,  the  "Loyal 
(Quebec  Volunteers"  were  on  the  ist  of  May,  nS^S,  disbanded,  and  he  returned  to 
Montreal,  and  received  the  situation  of  Inspector  of  Ashes.  In  .N(jvembi;r  the 
rebellion  having  again  broken  out,  he  was  transferred  to  the  Montreal  Light  Infantry, 
and  served  with  them  till  the  troubles  were  over.  In  1845,  during  the  Oregon 
dilticiilty,  he  organized  the  Montreal  Light  Infantry  in  three  weeks. 

In  1850,  he  acted  as  Magistrate  with  the  Troops  in  suppressing  the  fearful  riots* 
in  (Irifl'mlown,  when  207  houses  were  burned.  In  1855,  at  the  reorganization  of  the 
active  militia,  he  was  a])pointed  Lieutenant-Colonel  of  the  Montreal  Rifles,  now  the 
Prince  of  Wales,  and  on  his  promotion  to  command  the  brigade  was  presented  by 
the  Regiment  with  a  magnificent  testiiTionial.  In  t86o,  he  was  appointed  Commandant

years  of  the  St.  George's  Society  of  Montreal.  In  1.S66,  (hiring  the  l""enian 
difliculties,  he  commanded  the  Second  Urigade,  the  l-'irst  being  composed  of  all 
the  Kegulars,  the  Second  of  all  the  \'ohmleers.  In  1S6S,  by  the  provision  of  Sir 
George  Cartier's  Militia  iJill.  his  connection  with  the  force  was,  mu('h  to  his  regret, 
unexpectedly  severed  after  I'lfty-four  years  of  uninterrupted  service,  lie  was,  however, 
by  special  privilege  allowed  to  retain  his  rank.  On  the  25th  of  March,  1.S71,  he  was 
presented  by  the  Volunteer  I'orce  with  a  inagnit'iceiil  full  length  portrait  of  himself, 
j)ainted  by  the  late  well-known  artist,  Mr.  Hell-Smitli,  sen.  So  great  was  the  number 
of  persons  present  on  the  occasion  that  the  ceremony  became  a  jjcrfect  ovation.  The 
hall  was  densely  packed,  and  hundreds  were  unable  to  gain  admittance.  I  lis  sixty  years 
service  in  the  Military  Korcc  of  the  country  did  not  impair  his  \  igor.  To  the  last  he 
was  fond  of  all  athletic  pursuits,  and  was  a  keen  curler.  On  one  occasion  he  had  the 
honor,  at  his  l,oidship's  special  invitation,  of  playing  a  single-handed  match  with  the 
Governor  General,  the  Karl  of  Dufferin,  who  had  been  a  pupil  of  the  Colonel's  in 
curling.  After  a  most  eventful  life  and  beloved  by  all  classes  of  the  citizens,  he

of  IJ. ('.!,.  In  the  same  year  he  was  called  to  tlie  J!ar  of  the  Province  of  (Quebec. 
Prior  to  this  he  had,  in  1874.  entered  the  Military  School  in  Montreal,  taking  a  se(  ond- 
class  certificate,  intl  then  joined  No.  i  Cavalry  Trooj).  Since  i&gt;&gt;75,  he  his  been  an 
active  member  of  St.  Jean  Haptisie  S(n:iel),  .Montreal,  and,  in  iSSo,  becanie  a  member 
of  the  s;ime  society  in  ValUyfield.  His  first  appearance  in  the  arena  of  active 
politics  was  in  li'i-jij,  when  the  death  of  the  sitting  member  for  Meauharnois  left  a 
vacancy  in  the  representation  of  that  constituency.  Mr.  Ilerjeron  was  nominated 
and  elected  by  thirteen  votes  over  his  opponent,  and  was  re-elected  by  acclamation 
on  the  13th  June,  18S2.  To  illustrate  the  confidence  which  his  electors  refxjse  in  him, 
it  may  be  noted  that  when,  in  I.SS7,  Mr.  Bergeron — having  taken  a  very  aciive  part 
in  the  North-West  political  difticulty,  and  fighting  the  Clovernmcnt  on  such  a  point 
— offered  himself  again  for  re-election,  though  opjiosed  by  a  Oovernment  candidate 
(Mr.  Pelletier),  and  in  spile  of  ilu;  constituency  been  looked  upon  as  a  Tory  strong- 
hold.— in  spite  als(j  of  the  patronage  exercised  by  them  on  a  large  scale,  .Mr.  Jiergeron 
carried  the  election  by  a  majority  of  222  votes.  When  the  House  opened,  after  the 
election  of  18S7,  the  administration  which  Mr.  iiergeron  had  supported  fo"  eight 
years  previously  was  still  in  power,  and  as  the  Kiel  and  North-West  (piestions  were 
matters  of  the  past,  and  coukl  not  be  brought  before;  Parliament  any  more,  Mr.  Per- 
geron,  still  holding  on  those  (luestions  the  same  views,  continued  his  sup|)ort  to  the 
Ciovernment,  whose  general  policy,  he  was  convinced,  was  in  the  interest  of  the 
country,  in  the  election  of  1S91,  Mr.  Bergeron  had  to  cross  swords  with  his  first 
opponent,  Mr.  I..  .A.  Seers,  who  presented  himself  as  an  Independent("onservative, 
having  the  support  of  the  entire  Liberal  parly,  but  .Mr.  Jk-rgeron  was  elected  by  over 
300  majority.  .\t  the  Session  of  18S2,  Mr.  ]&gt;ergeron  moved  the  .\ddress  in  reply  to 
the  Speech  from  the  Throne.  He  was  then  but  iweniy-seven  years  of  age.  During 
the  last  Parliament,  from  1888  to  1890,  Mr.  ]»ergeron  was  Chairman  of  the  Standing 
Committee,  one  of  the  most  importiiMt  comniittees  of  the  House.  \t  the  opening  of 
the  last  Session  of  Parliament,  he  was  elected  Deputy  Speaker  of  the  Commons,  a 
further  proof  of  his  ability  and  popularity.  On  July  7th,  1S90,  Mr.  liergeron  was 
united  in  marriage  with  Miss  Ada  Wall,  daughter  of  the  late  Robert  Wall,  of  Mon- 
treal. Mr.  Bergeron  is  a  pleasing  speaker,  an  indefatigable  worker,  and  thoroughly 
versed  in  parliamentary  procedure.  Having  youth,  ability  ond  popularity  on  his 
side,  the  friends  of  Mr.  Bergeron  may  fairly  be  pardoned  if  they  indulge  the  confident 
hope  that  his  will  be  a  bright  and  eminently  successful  public  career,  even  as  it  has 
been  in  the  past.  Mr.  Bergeron  is  a  member  of  the  St.  Denis  Club,  Le  Canadien 
Club,  City  Club,  St.  James  Club,  and  the  Montreal  Hunt  Club."

for  the  place  and  its  neighborhood,  but  were  not  a  jiecuniary  success  to  him,  and  he 
soon  .accepted  the  offered  position  of  Registrar,  then  becoming  one  of  coinparaiive 
importance  in  such  a  coimiry.  A  man  of  kind  manners  and  progressive  views  he 
wielded  unlimited  influence  throughout  a  large  district. 

The  early  part  of  William  K.  Liglithall's  life  was  thus  spent  at  Huntingdon 
and  Ormstown.  In  1846,  he  studied  his  profession  at  Montreal  under  Mr.  J.  j. 
Gibb,  and  afterwards  under  the  late  Mr.  J.  H.Joliin.  Passing  in  184S,  he  rom- 
iDenced  practice  in  Ormstown,  where  he  acted  at  the  same  time  as  deputy  of  his 
father.  On  the  invitation  of  .Sir  A.  S,  Mc.Nab,  Premier,  he  went  to  Hamilton, 
Upper  Canada,  to  study  for  the  JJar  of  that  Province,  but  he  never  completed  his 
course.  AVhile  there  he  acted  as  heputy  Registrar  of  the  City,  and  assisted  in 
totally  reforming  the  sys-tcm  of  registration,  which  hail  been  in  a  bad  state.  I'inding 
after  two  years  i  lat  he  preferred  Montreal  to  Hamilton,  he,  in  1859,  removed  to  the 
former  city,  where  liv  resumed  the  practice  of  his  original  profession.  He  had  mar- 
ried in  the  meantime,  ai  Hamilton,  a  daughter  of  Captain  Henry  Wright,  of  ("hateau- 
guay. He  has  long  enjoyed  a  large  i)ractice  in  Montreal,  and  may  fairly  be  styled 
one  of  the  landmarks.  He  has  served  on  different  occasions  as  representative  of 
the  .Montreal  Notaries  on  the  Provincial  JJoard  of  Notaries.  The  improvement  of 
the  Profession  has  always  been  one  of  his  aims,  and  it  is  to  his  efforts  that  the  estab- 
lishment of  a  Notarial  Chair  at  McCiill  University  is  due.  He  was  appointed  a  Jus- 
tice of  the  Peace  in  1865,  and  has  been  u  number  of  limes  called  upon  to  accept  the 
representation  of  Chateauguay  in  Parliament,  and  the  aldermanship  of  influential 
wards  in  Montreal,  but  has  refused  to  touch  politics  or  civic  honors.  His  sons  are 
Mr.  W.  D.  Lighthall,  advocate,  and  Mr.  G.  R.  Lighlhall,  notary.  Mr.  W.  D.  Light- 
hall  is  becoming  widely  known  on  account  of  his  literary  career.  He  has  collected 
and  printed  a  fine  volume  of  poetry,  embodying  all  the  best  pieces  of  native  literature, 
and  he  has  been  very  active  in  the  erection  of  the  various  notice  boards  now  being 
placed  throughout  the  city  at  those  places  which  are  marked  in  the  history  of  Mon- 
treal. He  is  a  member  ofseveral  literary  and  scientific  societies,  and  a  young  man 
of  promise.

five  years  ofa^-c.  In  ihc  (iriiiid  Assembly  at  St.  (,'liarKs,  on  llic  a^tli  October,  iS^y. 
he  scc«)iiilc&lt;I  one  of  llic  ri'soliilioiis.  One  clay  previously  at  thi' rimrth  door,  alter 
MaHH,  he  declared  he  vvonldyivf  two  hundred  bushels  of  urain  to  buy  powder,  whic:h 
soinllamcd  the  youiij^  men  that  they  joined  him  in  numbers.  After  the  battle  otSt. 
Chailfs,  \  i^er  esiMped,  but  was  taken  prisoner  near  Isle  au.\  Noix,  and  condiuted 
to  the  Montreal  Prison.  The  first  one  he  saw  when  he  arrived  at  the  J.iil  was  "  Ic 
trnitrc  Arnoldi." 

This  patriot  was  cousin  to  lion.  I ).  |{.  \iyer.     After  many  trials  and  adventures 
he  was  taken  prisoner  and  &lt;:ondii&lt;:ted   to  Montreal  (laol.      lie   w. is  the  most  refrac- 
tory of  all  the    'Sons  of  Liberty  "  therein  tonfmed.      .\    story  is    told  of  him  thai 
siiows   his   f|ui&lt;  k  and    resolute   spirit,  which  was  seen   in   all  his  actions  dmini.,'  the 
Rebellion.     One  day  whilst  cvcrythini;  was  j^oing  on  smcjolhly  inside  the  g.iol,  Niger 
asked  for  some  water  from  the  sentmel.     Now,  water  in  those  days  was  not  so  easily 
procured  as  at  the  present  time.     The  water  had  t(j  be  fetched  from  the  St.  Lawrence 
opposite,  and  many  stories  are  told  of  how  prisoners,  when  srni  out  for  w.iier,  espe- 
cially dm'ing  the  winter  time,  would  escape  by  crossing   the  river  and  getting  away 
on  the  neighboring  side  into  ihe  woods  and  then  to  the  Slates.     The  .Montreal  W'.iter 
Works  never  were  applied  to  a  better  purpose  than  in  the  now  plentiful  supply  of  w.iler 
within  the  prison,  for  culinary  and  cle.insing  purposes.     Indeed  a  very  great  amount 
in  the    decrease  of  disease    and  filth   is    entirely  owing  to  the,  I   might   say.  super- 
abundaiu    use    of    water    and  soap,  so    pKiitifully   applied  by  the  late  Mr.  Payette 
and  his  eflicient  successor,  Mr.  Vallee.     When  the  sentinel  was  asked  for  the  water  he 
at  first  refused,  but  thinking  better  of  it,  he  took  a  cup  of  water  and  carried  it  to  Viger- 
He  took  the  goblel  ami  threw    the  contents  in  the   face   of  the  guard.      furious  at 
this  insult,   the    guard  discharged  his  gun,    the   ball  traversing   the  window  sill  of 
Viger's  cell,   passed  him  at  some   distance  and  lodged  in   the  wall  of  thai  of  Mr. 
Lacoste,  who  was  also  imi^risoned  at  this  time  as  one  of  the  Patriots.     The  guard 
having  thrust  through  his  head  between  the  bars  to  see  what  effect  the  shot  had  done. 
received  a   tremendous  blow  from  \  iger,  who  had   seized  a  bottle  and  brought  it 
down  with  such  force  as  to  lay  open  and  smash  his  nose.     As  might  be  expected  this 
scene  caused   a  great   commotion  in   the  i)rison,  and  the  authorities,   exasperated, 
determined  to   proceed  against  \'iger  for  his  unmerciful  attack.     Next  day  ciuile  a 
stir  was  made  by  the  arrival  of  the  Deputy  Sheriff  and  several  soldiers  to  |)lace  X'iger 
in  chains.     He  at  once,  acting  on   the  spur  of  the  moment,  seized  by  one  hand  the 
coal  of  the  Deputy  Sheriff,  and  with  the  other  drawing  a  knife  from  his  pocket,  said 
to  him  :  "  What  right  have  you  to  put  a  man  in  irons  without  the  Sheriff  saying  so  ?  " 
Sometime  after  this,  Viger,  with  others,  was  sent  as  an  exile   to  ]}crmudas,  and 
about  the  time  of  Robert  Nelson's  defeat  at  Odeltown,  in  1838,  he,  with  others,  had 
returned  from  Bermudas  to  the  United  States,  and  reluming  to  Canada  he  was  again

arrested,  on  the  Slh  June,  1839,  tried  and  bailed  out,  and  afterwards  became  a 
"  citoyen  paisible  "  as  one  account  gives  of  him.  His  son  is  now  one  of  tlie  largest 
grocers  in  Montreal,  belonging  to  the  well-known  firm  of  Fraser,  Viger  &amp;  Co.,  of  St.

CAPTAIN  JALBERT. 

The  trial  of  Captain  Jalbert  was  one  of  the  most  interesting  in  the  annals  of  the 
Rebellion,  and  the  only  one  tried  by  Civil  Court,  the  ('ourt  of  Queen's  Bench.  On 
the  3rd  day  of  September,  1839,  '^^  ^^'^^^  arraigned  before  the  Bar  of  Justice  in  the 
Court  House  of  Montreal,  after  an  incarceration  of  nearly  two  years.  His  accusa- 
tion was  that  he  was  guilty  "on  the  23rd  November,  1837,  of  ^'1^'  deatli  of  Lieuten- 
ant George  Weir,  of  the  32nd  Regi'^ent  of  Her  Majesty." 

Three  Judges  sat  on  the  Bench,  viz  :  Judge  G.  Pyke,  Judge  J.  R.  RoUand  and 
Judge  S.  (lale.  Attorney-General  Ogden  conducted  the  trial,  and,  with  the  cele- 
brated Andrew  Stuart,  represented  the  Crown.  Mr.  Walker  and  Mr.  Chas.  Mondelet 
were  retained  for  the  accused.  The  jury,  says  one,  was  comi)osed  entirely  of  French 
Canadians.  Another  account  (LcMoine)  says  it  was  composed  of  nine  French 
Canadians  and  three  old  country  men.  And  another  account  makes  it  eleven  French 
Canadians  and  one  old  country  man.  To  set  this  matter  right  the  real  truth  is  that 
the  jury  consisted  of  eight  French  Canadians  and  four  P^nglishmen,  as  is  seen  with 
their  names  further  down  this  sketch,  and  which  list  tiie  Writer  himself  look  from  the 
original  papers  in  the  archives  in  the  Court  House. 

Previous  to  this  date,  Mr.  C.  Mondelet  had  put  into  the  Court  of  (Queen's  Bench 
— Criminal  side — a  motion  withdrawing  Jalbert's  plea  of  "  not  guilty  "  and  substituting 
a  special  one  which  he  founded  on  the  general  amnesty  of  Lord  Durham  promul- 
gated on  the  28th  day  of  the  previous  June.  The  general  substance  of  this  si)ecial 
plea  was  that  Lord  Durham  had  proclaimed  a  general  pardon,  and  not  mentioning 
any  particular  j)risoner's  name  to  whom  it  did  not  apply,  that  in  virtue  of  this  Ordin- 
ance the  prisoner  Jalbert,  though  accused  of  the  murder  of  Lieut.  Weir,  was  included 
in  the  amnesty  as  the  proclamation  had  been  approved  off  by  Her  Majesty  and  by 
Her  Representative,  the  Governor  General  in  Chief.  After  a  long  and  animated 
discussion  between  Mr.  .Nfondelet  and  the  Solicitor-General  Stuart,  the  motion  was 
rejected  by  the  Judges,  and  on  the  3rd  of  September,  the  prisoner  was  arraigned 
before  the  Har  of  the  Court. 

The  accusation  held  against  four  persons,  Jalbert,  J.  Bte.  &gt;Laillet,  Joseph  Pratte, 
and  Louis  Lussier,  and  was  divided  into  four  charges  :  ist.  "That  the  prisoner  Jalbert 
had  carried  the  sword  of  the  deceased  Lieut.  Weir,  and  had  been  aided  and  abetted 
by  the  other  three.  2nd.  That  when  J.  B.  Maillet  had  xhe  sword  in  his  Iiand,  the 
prisoner  with  the  other  two  aided  and  assisted  in  the  murder  of  Lieut.  Weir.  3rd« 
That  whei^  Jose])h  Pratte  had  a  sword  in  his  hand,  the  prisoner  with  the  other 
two  aided  and  assisted  in  the  murder  of  Lieut.  Weir.  4th.  That  when  Louis 
Lussier  had  fired  a  gun  at  the  deceased,  Jalbert  and  the  two  others  were  present, 
aiding,  assisting  and  encouraging  in  the  commitment  of  the  murder." 


GAZETTEER  OF  MONTREAL.  237 

The  other  three  mentioned  in  the  indictment  had  tied  to  the  United  States.     As 
an  historical  fact,  and  especially  as  in  all  smaller  English  Canadian  Histories,  very 
little  is  told  us  of  this  unfortunate  episode  of  the  times  of  the  Rebellion,  1  will  give  the 
Solicitor-General's  ojjcning  remarks,  whicli  clearly  and  succinctly  state  all  the  circum- 
stances connected  with  this  melancholy  affair.     He  said  :  "  You  will  probably  recol- 
lect that  in  November,  1837,  a  detachment  of  troops  under  the  command  of  Col,  Oore 
marched  upon  St.  Denis.   Lieut.  Weir  of  the  32nd  Regiment  of  Her  Majesty,  which  was 
then  stationed  in  Montreal,  received  orders  to  go  to  Sorel  to  carry  despatches  for  Col. 
Gore.     Determined  to  reach  Col.  Gore  in  the  shortest  possible  time,  he  went  by  land, 
as  the  Col.  and  his   little  army  had  gone  by  water.     Full  of  the  accomplishment  of 
this   object,   Lieut.  Weir    hired  a  vehicle  to  take    him  to  Col.  Gore  before  lie  should 
reach  St.  Denis.     It  is  but  right  to  state  here  that,  at  the  distance  of  four  miles  from 
Sorel,  the  road  divides   into  two  branches,  one  of  which  is  much  longer  than    the 
otlicr-     Lieut.  Weir,  presuming,  without  doubt,  that  Col.  Gore  had  taken  the  shortest 
route,  passed  by    the  other  and   thus   missed  him.     Going  along  this  way,   he  was 
arrested  by  a  guard,  and    brought  as  a  prisoner  into  the  presence   of  Dr.   Nelson. 
The  latter  then  gave  orders  that  he  should  be  sent  as  a  prisoner  to  St.  Charles   liider 
the  charge  of  Jalbert  and  others.     His  hands  were  then  bound  and  he  was   mounted 
in  a  waggon.     A  r'.ort  time  after   they  untied  his   hands.     Near  the  church  Lieut. 
Weir  jumped  out  of  the  waggon  and  is  struck  by  a  man  of  the  name  of  j\Iailict  who 
had  a  sword  in  his  hand.     Jalbert,  who  at  that  moment  was  on  horseback,  and  had 
a  sword  at  his  side,  cried  out  '  kill  him,  kill  him,  the  deserter.'     At  the  same  instant 
Jalbert  gave  him  a  cut  of  his  sword  under  which  the  deceased  fell.     The  others  fol- 
lowing his  example,  Lieut.  Weir  succumbed  to  the  storm  of  blows  that  fell  upon  him. 
The  band  standing  around  him,  he  breathed  again,  when  one  of  them  cried  out  with  a 
loud  voice,     '  He  is  recovering,  he  is  recovering.'     The  prisoner  at  the  bar  is  one  of 
those  who  believed  so.     A  man  named  Lussier  then  came   up  and  discharged   a  gun 
or  pistol  at  the  deceased.     Several  days  after  the  engagement  with  the   troops,  the 
authorities  made  a  search  for  the  body,  and  they  found  it  at  some  distance  from  tnc 
river,  covered  with  wounds  and  horribly  mutilated." 

The  trial  continued  seven  days,  witnesses  for  the  Crown  proving  such  facts  that 
the  Crown  prosecutions  were  established.  It  was  proved  that  Maillet,  Pratte  and 
Lussier  had  struck  the  body  of  Lieut.  Weir  many  times,  but  there  was  a  contradiction 
in  the  case  of  Jalbert ;  several  witnesses  affirmed  that  Weir  had  been  killed  before 
Jalbert  arrived  where  they  were. 

From  the  records  taken  from  the  trial  of  C  of  Q.  B.,  I  find  that  the  debated 
point  of  the  composition  of  the  jury  is  settled  once  and  for  all  by  the  following  being 
the  sworn  jurors  : 

Etienne  Courville,  Charles  Lenoir  dit  Rolland,  Pascal  Lemieux,  Edwin  Atwater, 
Simeon  Lecomte,  Elie  Deseve,  Benjamin  Trudelle,  Amable  Desautels,  Daniel 
McKercher,  George  Eraser,  John  Cadotte,  John  Mabell. 

The  trial  continuing  seven  days,  or  rather  some  of  the  Ju.y  determining  to  bring 


238  GAZETTKER    OF    MON'J  REAL. 

in  n  verdict  of  not  guilty,  day  by  day  refused  to  come  to  an  understanding  except 
tluit  of  non-agreement.  On  Saturday,  the  7th  September,  one  of  the  Jurors,  Edwin 
Atwater,  was  indisposed  and  required  refresliment.  The  Jurors  llien  received  food, 
etc.,  and  were  locked  up  for  the  night  and  all  Sunday.  On  Monday,  not  agreeing, 
they  were  again  ordered  to  retire,  and  I  find  this  :  "  The  following  constables  are 
sworn  to  keep  the  jury  in  this  case  without  meat,  drink,  fire  or  candle,  and  to  suffer 
none  to  speak  to  them,  nor  siieak  to  them  themselves,  expect  to  ask  if  they  are 
agreed." 

Daniel  Shannon  and  (reorge  (iibson  were  the  constables. 

On  the  last  day  of  the  term  the  Jury  were  again  remanded  to  their  room,  and  che 
Court  adjourned  to  half-past  eleven  at  night,  when  Judges  Rolland  and  Gale  were 
present.  It  records  "  the  Court  at  fifteen  minutes  before  twelve,  or  midnight,  desires 
that  the  Jurors  be  brought  into  Court,"  and  the  Jurors  unanimously  delare  that  they 
have  not  agreed  upon  a  verdict,  nor  are  ever  likely  to  agree. 

The  Attorney-General  and  the  prisoner's  Counsel  "  having  declared  that  they 
had  nothing  more  to  nujve,"  and  ''  the  term  as  fixed  by  law  for  holding  this  Criminal 
Session  extending  only  until  midnight,  the  Court  at  that  hour  (juitted  the  Uench,  the 
Session  being  over  and  tlie  Jury  were  discharged." 

In  a  few  moments  no  persons  were  in  the  room  save  W^and  the  Gaoler,  and  the 
prisoner,  and  the  late  Mr.  Schiller,  then  quite  a  young  man.  Jalbert  was  taken  back 
to  the  prison  and  soon  discharged. 

A  considerable  riot  occurred,  several  of  the  Jurors  receiving  hard  blows,  and  a 
detachment  of  the  Guards  and  a  troop  of  cavalry  of  the  7th  Hussars  were  necessary 
to  restore  order.  As  one  writer  quaintly  remarks  concerning  the  riot  :  "  La  foule 
se  disperse,  et  ainsi  se  termine  ce  proces  oil  se  concentra  tant  d'animosite  de  la 
part  de  cetle  population  jadis  si  loyale,  mais  aujourd'hui  enfin,  devenue  revolu- 
lionnaire." 

KLKANAII  BILLINGS,  F.K.G.S. 

Mr.  IjILIjngs  was  one  of  the  most  talented  paUeontologists  that  Canada  ever  pos- 
sessed, and  whose  name  was  for  years  associated  with  the  Geological  Survey  of 
Canada.  He  was  an  Ottawaite,  having  been  born  in  the  township  of  Gloucester,  on 
the  Ottawa,  on  the  5lh  of  May.  iSao.  His  father's  family  came  originally  from 
Wales,  and  settled  in  the  New  England  Slates.  His  father  was  born  in  Massachu- 
setts during  the  war  of  the  Revolution,  shortly  after  which  his  grandfather  came  to 
Canada,  and  settled  near  Brockville. 

Mr.  Billings  pursued  his  studies  partly  at  Ottawa  city  and  partly  at  Potsdam, 
N.V.  He  entered  the  Law  Society  of  Upper  Canada  as  a  student-at-law  in  Trinity 
term,  1840  ;  and  studied  at  different  offices,  in  Ottawa  and  Toronto.  At  the  latter 
place  he  completed  his  probationary  studies,  and  was  called  *'j  the  Bar  in  1845,  He 
practiced  in  Ottawa  city  and  the  adjoining  county  of  Renfrew  until  June,  1856,  when 
he  was  appointed  Palaiontologist  of  the  Geological  Survey  of  Canada.  He  was  elected 
a  fellow  of  the  Royal  Geological  Society  of  London  in  February,  1858. 


GAZETTEER   OF    MONTREAL.  239 

While  residing  in  Ottawa  city,  Mr,  Billings  made  a  large  and  valuable  collection 
of  the  fossils  which  abound  in  the  rocks  of  tiie  neighborhood.  By  studying  these,  he 
made  himself  well  acquainted  with  the  palaeontology  of  the  Silurian  rocks  of  Canada. 
His  first  papers  were  jjublislied  in  tlie  Ot/cuoa  Citizen  newspaper,  and  in  the  Cana- 
dian /oi/rn  a  I  oi  'l\n-o\\io  ;  the  latter  the  organ  of  the  Canadian  Institute,  and  a  most 
valuable  publication.  In  l-ebruary,  1856,  iMr.  Billings  published  the  first  number  of 
the  Canadian  Natiirclist.  a  periodical  devoted  to  scientific  objects,  which  ])roved 
extremely  successful.  The  first  volume  was  edited  by  Mr.  Billings.  He  alsu  look 
an  active  part  in  the  compiling  and  issuing  of  the  Canadian  Journal  and  oi  Silli- 
man's  Journal.  In  1863,  he  obtained  a  medal  of  honor  at  the  Universal  E.xhibition 
of  London,  and  in  1S67  the  Historical  Society  of  Montreal  conferred  on  him  the 
same  honor.  Perhaps  there  is  no  man  who  has  written  S(j  much  as  xMr.  Billings  has  on 
a  vast  variety  of  subjects  connected  with  his  profession.  It  would  be  impossible  here 
to  enumerate  them.  He  is  thus  spoken  of  in  Litteraturc  Caiuidiennc :  '•  Mr.  Billings 
est,  au  dire  des  savants,  la  plus  haute  autorite  de  la  puissance  en  fait  de  paleontologie." 
He  died  full  of  honors  some  years  ago. 

REV.  ROBT.  L.  LUSHER, 

An  eminent  Minister  in  tlie  Wesleyan  Denomination,  was  born  in  London  in  the  year 
1786.  and  at  an  early  age  was  trained  and  educated  for  the  Ministry.  In  1817 
he  was  appointed  to  take  charge  of  the  Society  in  ^Montreal,  and  arrived  here  in 
December  of  that  year.  The  Wesleyan  chapel  ai  that  lime  was  in  St.  Sulpice  street, 
once  occupied  by  the  Fabrique,  but  now  pulled  down,  where  he  preached  for  three 
years.  He  returned  to  England  in  1828,  and  nine  years  later  he  was  reappointed 
as  Chief  Pastor  of  the  Wesleyan  Body  in  Lower  Canada,  and  arrived  here  in  October, 
1837.  Shortly  after  his  second  arrival  in  this  country  his  health  gradually  tailed,  and 
after  a  career  of  great  usefulness,  he  died  in  July,  1848,  in  the  sixty-second  year  of 
his  age  and  thirty-third  of  his  Ministry.  He  was  chiefly  eminent  for  his  learning, 
gentleness  of  disposition,  and  deep  but  unobtrusive  piety.  The  scienc  of  Astronomy 
was  a  favorite  study  of  his,  and  his  lectures  on  that  subject  showed  great  research. 
As  a  preacher  he  was  seldom  ecjualled,  if  excelled,  in  his  day,  as  the  following  extract 
from  the  Canadian  Courant,  under  date  23rd  January,  1810,  will  shew  : 

"  We  have  sat  under  the  preaching  of  the  ablest  divines,  but  we  conceive  the 
pulpit  elocution  of  the  Rev.  Mr.  Lusher  in  this  or  almost  any  other  country  stands 
unrivaled.  Uniformly  elo(pient,  his  language  is  chaste,  persuasive  and  classically 
correct,  full  of  pathos  and  a  laudable  zeal.  Although  he  preaches  extemporaneously, 
the  eye  of  criticism  discovers  nothing  in  his  language  redundant,  nothing  to  retrench  ; 
and  whilst  it  sweetly  allures  the  understanding,  is  free  from  ostentation,  bigotry  and 
enthusiasm,  remarkable  in  a  preacher  of  that  persuasion."  It  was  not  an  uncommon 
occurrence  that  when  it  was  known  of  his  intention  to  preach  in  the  country  parts,  he 
had  to  take  his  position  at  the  church  door,  so  that  all  might  hear  him  both  outside 
and  in.  Mr.  Seymour,  of  Montreal,  remembers  this  to  have  been  the  case.  His  sou 
is  tie  present  Superintendent  of  the  Montreal  Street  Railway.

a  great  energy  to  keep  and  satisfy,  after  the  advancement  of  his  brother  to  the  Bench, 
a  very  large  number  of  clients.  He  was  considered  one  of  the  best  lawyers  of  the 
Bar  of  Montreal.  Since  1866  he  was  a  member  of  the  Council  of  the  Bar,  and 
was  elected  to  represent  the  St.  Louis  Ward  in  1861,  and  continued  for  some  time  to 
represent  the  Ward.  He  was  President  of  the  Committee  of  Arrangement  of  the

1873  for  the  county  of  Laval,  and  soon  became  one  of  the  members  of  the  Quebec 
Cabinet,  and,  after  being  one  of  the  best  Attorney-Generals  ever  in  ofiice,  was 
promoted  as  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court  of  Montreal,  where  he  has  been  ever  since. 
He  is  distinguished  by  a  practical  spirit,  a  sound  judgment,  an  easy  and  agreeable

HON.    JOHN    HAMILTON 

Was  born  in  Quebec,  1827.  Originally  the  family  came  from  Wandale,  Scotland 
He  was  the  third  son  of  Colonel  George  Hamilton  of  Hawkesbury,  Canada,  and 
educated  in  Montreal.  He  was  a  member  of  the  extensive  lumber  firm  of  Hamilton 
Bros.,  and  proprietor  of  the  Hawkesbury  Mills,  Ontario.  He  was  also  a  Director  of 
the  Bank  of  Montreal,  and  was  for  some  time  President  of  the  Merchants  Bank.  In 
i860,  he  was  elected  to  the  Legislature  of  United  Canada,  for  Inkerman,  and 
retained  his  seat  till  Confederation.  Then  by  Royal  Proclamation  he  was  called  to 
the  Senate,  in  which  body  he  remained  till  he  died  in  Montreal  not  long  ago.  His 
son  who  died  in  Colorado  recently  must  be  remembered  in  the  history  of  Montreal — 
a  fine  young  man  who  by  his  will  left  $100,000  to  the  funds  of  the  General  Hospital, 
besides  other  large  benefactions  to  private  individuals  and  other  public  institutions. 

MAJOR  GODDU

his  men  to  St.  Cesaire,  but  very  shortly  after  was  arrested  by  one  of  his  own  friends, 
who  was  a  Constitutionalist,  and  being  conducted  to  Montreal,  laden  with  chains, 
was  thrown  into  the  gaol,  where  he  remained  till  the  2nd  July,  1838,  when  he  was 
sent  to  Bermudas.  -^.  &gt;—-„-^  .^.     -  _  ^.

RAYMOND  rOURNIER   PNEFONTAIXE,  15.C.L.,  M.P. 

"  Was  born  al  i-ongucuil,  Province  of  (Quebec,  on  the   i6lh  of  September,  1850.  He 
is  descended  from  one  of  the  oldest  and  most   honoral)le  fainiHes  in  the   I'rovince. 
His  ancestors  settled  in  what  was  then  New  l-'rance,  in  1680.  Receiving  a  sound  edu- 
cation, partly  l)y  private  luiliun  anil  partly  at  the  Jesuits'  College  in   Montreal,  and 
gifted  with  strong  niiural  abilities.  abrilliaiU  future  was  predicted  for  him  al  an  early 
period.     He  graduated  from  ^fcCiill  University,  at  Mo'itreal.  and  in  1873  Was  called 
to  the  l&gt;ar,  receiving  the  degree  of  H.C.L.  the  same  year  from  Mcdill  College.     His 
success  in  the  ])ractice  of  the  law  has  been  an  unusually  brilliant  one,  and  he  is  now 
a  partner  in  one  of  the  leading  Law  firms  of  the   Metropolis.     .\t  an  early  age,  like 
most  young  lawyers,  he  went  into  politics,  and  ere  long  he   was  looked  upon,  not 
only  as  an  exceedingly  active  worker,  but  as   an  effective  orator  of  great  jjower  and 
a    coming  man.     At   the   General    l"'.lections   of   1875    for    the    Quebec   Legislative 
Assembly,  he  was  nominated  as  Liberal  candidate  while  only  in  his  25th  year.      He 
can  led    the  county  against  overwhelming  odds,      it  was  then    hoped  that   he  had 
emered  upon  a  career  of  great  credit  to  himself  and  usefulness  to  the  Province,  when 
he  was  relegated  to  private  life.       The  successful  candidate,  however,  was  unseated, 
and  in  1879   Mr.   I'refonlauie  was  re-elected.      In  1881,  at  the  time  of    the  (ieneral 
Elections,  when  "the  Conservative  wave  "  swept  over  the  I'rovince,  Mr.  Prefontainc 
found  himself  again  defeated.       While   a   member  of  the  Legislature  he  was  elected 
Mayor  of  Hochelaga,   and   secured  a   re-election  in  1884.      -^  year  later  Hochelaga 
was  annexed  to  the  city,   and   Mr.   PreOjnlaine  '.jccame  an   Alderman  of  MontreaL 
The  eyes  of  the   Dominion  were  turned  on  Mr.    Prefontaine  in    1886,  when  he  ran 
as  the  Nationalist  candidate    in    Chambly,    the  first  constituency    opened    b_v    the 
Dominion   Government   to    test  their  strength    after    the  execution  of    Louis  Riel. 
The    election    was    one    of   the    most    stubborn    and    fiercely    fought    contests    in 
Canada,  and  it  resulted  in  the  return  of  .Mr.   Prefontaine,  to  the  great  satisfaction 
of  his  friends  and  his  party.      The  Dominion  Elections  of    1887    came  on  before 
Mr.   Prefontainc  could    take  his  seat,    and  again    he  had    to  go    through  a  great 
contest,  but  he  did  so  successfully.      With  a  similar    result   at    the  next    General 
Elections    Mr.    Prefontaine    may    be    considered    as    possessing    the    entire    con- 
fidence   of    his    electors,  who    look    widi    pride    upon    tlieir   champion.      Mr.    Pre- 
fontaine  ranks  high  among    his    colleagnes    of    the  Commons,   and    is     one  of  the 
most  i)opular  members  of   the   House.       He   does   not  si)eak  often,    but  when    he 
does  it  is  to  the  point,  and  his  remarks  are  effective.     He  is  possessed  of  a  keen, 
discerning  judgment,  and  his  great  business  abilities  stand  him  in  good  stead.    He 
is  a  hard    worker  and  full  of  energy.      The  laboring  classes,    among   whom  he  is 
very  popular,  owe  him  much.      He  was   the  member  who  succeeded  in  having  the 
first  law  adopted  for  relieving  the   workingmen  from  the  persecution  of  insatiable 
creditors.     Only  one  half  of  the  wages  of  laborers  can  now  be  seized  for  debt.     In 

Ottawa  he  has  devoted  much  time  and  labor  in  securing  a  practicable  charter  for

sively Montreal  and  tiie  south  shore  of  the  St.  Lawrence  by  bringing  them  into  closer 
relations  by  easy  access  from  one  side  of  the  river  to  the  other.  Lately  Mr.  Trefon- 
taine  has  devoted  much  of  his  great  energy  and  applied  his  talents  as  an  Alderman 
and  Chairman  of  the  Road  Committee  to  entirely  lenovate  the  roadway  of  the  streets 
of  Montreal,  and  in  this  he  has  succeeded  in  a  wonderful  manner.  During  the  four 
years  that  he  has  ])resided  over  this  imjjortant  body  he  has  succeeded  in  carrying 
out  a  considerable  part  of  a  vast  scheme  of  improvement,  extending  over  the  entire 
city,  and  which  is  intended  to  make  of  Montreal  one  of  the  cleanest  and  best  paved 
cities  on  the  Continent.  Personally  he  is  very  popular,  and  although  one  of  the 
busiest  men  among  his  ellow-citizcns,  he  is  always  ready  and  willing  to  help  his 
friends  and  those  who  apply  to  him.  He  is  especially  poi)uiar,  and  leads  among  the 
younger  generation  wno  have  great  faith  in  the  future  of  Montreal,  and  wax  enthu- 
siastic over  its  prosperity.  In  1876,  Mr.  Prefontaine  married  Mile.  Hermantine  Rol- 
land.  second  daughter  of  the  late  Senator  J.  15.  Rolland,  and  lias  three  children." 

JOHN  WANI.K.SS,  M.D. 

*'  This  famed  homoeopathic  ])iiysician  is  a  Scotchman  by  birt  .,  having  been  born  at 
Perth  road,  Dundee,  near  St.  Peter's  parish  church,  where  the  celebrated  Rev.  R.  M. 
McCheyne  was  pastor,  on  May  26th,  1813.  He  is  the  second  son  of  the  late  James 
Wanless,  a  man  who  was  in  his  day  very  much  respected  by  his  fellow  townspeople, 
and  who  for  many  years  carried  on  business  as  a  manufacturer  of  green  cloth  in  Dun- 
dee. His  mother,  .\gnes  Sim,  at  the  age  of  ninety-six  years,  was  in  full  jjossession 
of  her  mental  faculties,  and  could  see  to  read  without  si)ectacles.  Dr.  Wanless  much 
resembles  this  wond'^rful  woman  in  many  respects.  Dr.  Wanless's  father  intended 
that  his  two  sons  should  succeed  him  in  his  own  business,  but  after  his  death, 
which  took  place  when  the  doctor  was  only  ten  years  old,  the  executors  of  the  estate, 
when  he  had  reached  his  thirteenth  year,  apijrenliced  him  to  Dr.  James  Johnston, 
one  of  themselves,  a  leading  physician  in  Diuidec.  This  gentleman  having  died 
shortly  afterwards,  James  Hay,  merchant  and  ship-owner,  another  of  the  execu- 
tors, and  one  of  the  governors  of  the  Dundee  Royal  Infirmary,  discovering  the 
boy's  aptitude  for  medical  study,  was  induced  to  secure  for  him  the  position  of 
dresser  and  clinical  clerk  in  the  above  hosjjital,  which  for  three  years  he  filled  to  the 
entire  satisfaction  of  the  governors  and  medical  men  of  the  institution.  While  he  was 
here  he  was  a  great  favorite  with  the  celebrated  lithotomist.  Dr.  John  Creighton,  of 
Dundee,  and  this  gentleman  often  asked  young  Wanless  to  assist  him  in  his  private 
operations,  as  well  as  in  the  hospital,  and  on  the  eve  of  his  leaving  to  prosecute  his 
studies  in  Edinburgh,  he  bore  high  testimony  to  his  ability  and  diligence  as  a  student, 
and  as  to  his  practical  knowledge  of  his  profession.  It  may  be  as  well  to  mention 
here  that  young  Wanless,  like  all  other  boys  on  the  Scotch  seaboard,  was  very  fond 
of  paddling  in  the  water,  and  on  several  occasions  narrowly  escaped  drowning. 


GAZETTEER   OF    MONTREAI,.  843 

When  aljout  ten  years  of  age  he  and  some  other  boys  wore  amusing  tliemselves  on 
some  logs  that  had  got  adrift  from  the  ship  J/orton,  of  Dundee,  jus'  arrived  from 
America,  and  Iiad  floated  up  the  river  into  a  small  bay,  which  at  its  mouth  had  a 
sort  of  i)ier  with  arches  on  it.  While  astride  a  piece  of  this  timber  it  capsi/ed,  and 
our  young  hero  was  soon  at  the  bottom  of  the  river.  On  coming  to  the  surface,  he 
found  himself  immediately  below  a  raft,  and  considering  that  his  time  had  'lot  yet 
come  to  be  drowned,  he  struck  out  boldly  from  under,  and  gasping  for  breath,  he  was 
hauled  on  the  rafl  by  his  terrified  comrades.  On  getting  ashore  he  dried  his  clothes 
and  niadt;  for  home;  but  his  father  nevertheless  discovered  that  he  had  had  a  duck- 
ing, and  gave  him  a  sound  thrashing  and  confined  him  indoors  for  some  time  for  his 
boyish  escapade.  Tiie  doctor  now  thinks  tiiat  if  his  father — who  was  a  very  loving 
man — had  not  been  imbued  with  the  idea  that  "he  that  spareth  the  rod  Iiaietli  the 
child,"  he  would  have  done  belter  had  he  given  him  some  dry  clothes,  or  sent  him 
for  a  time  to  a  warm  bed.  In  1831,  John  "Vanless  left  J)undee  and  went  to  l^din- 
burgii,  as  a  student  in  tiie  Royal  College  of  Surgeons,  under  the  then  celebrated  Pro- 
fessors Mcintosh,  Liston,  Lizars,  Ferguson,  and  others,  Fellows  of  the  College,  all  of 
whom  are  now  gone  to  their  final  rest.  During  the  College  Session  of  183 1,  his  friend, 
Mr.  Hay,  offered  him  the  position  of  Surgeon  on  board  the  whaling  ship  Thomas, 
which  office  he  cheerfully  accepted,  althougii  he  was  then  only  seventeen  years  of 
age.  This  good  ship  sailed  from  Dundee  in  March,  1832,  and  returned  with  a  full 
cargo  in  time  to  permit  the  young  Surgeon  to  attend  the  opening  of  the  College 
Session  of  1832-3.  Subsequently  during  college  vacation  he  went  three  times  to 
Davis  Straits  in  the  same  ship,  and  thereby  greatly  Invigorated  his  previously  rather 
slender  physical  frame.  While  on  one  of  his  whaling  voyages  he  one  day  was  out  in 
a  boat  shooting  loons,  which  are  very  numerous  in  Davis  Straits,  and  a  good  many 
can  be  killed  by  one  discharge  from  a  gun.  In  the  act  of  gathering  the  killed  he 
espied  a  wounded  bird  at  a  short  distance,  and  in  his  endeavor  to  reach  it  he  leaned 
too  fiir  over  the  gunwale,  lost  his  balance,  and  went  head  first  into  the  Arctic  Sea.  His 
shipmates  were  alarmed,  and  waited  in  dread  suspense  for  some  time,  but  at  length 
he  came  up,  holding  on  to  the  loon  by  one  of  its  legs.  The  mate  afterwards 
remarked  "  that  the  doctor  should  always  be  taken  with  the  shooting  parties,  for  he 
could  dive  for  the  wounded  fellows."  It  may  be  here  mentioned  that  the  doctor  was 
a  good  swimmer,  and  as  a  youth  practised  swimming  in  the  Tay  of  Dundee,  and  was 
in  the  habit,  sometimes,  of  carrying  younger  boys  on  his  back  out  into  the  stream, 
and  then  throwing  them  off;  but  before  doing  this,  however,  he  always  gave  them 
instructions  how  to  swim  on  their  "  own  hook."  He  has  been  known  to  swim  for 
three  miles  on  a  stretch,  resting  occasionally  on  his  back.  At  Pond's  Bay  he  one 
time  fell  out  of  a  boat,  while  steering  with  a  long  oar,  amongst  a  lot  of  whales. 
There  were  about  fifty  ships'  boats  and  their  crews  in  a  crack  in  the  land  ice,  which 
extended  about  twenty  miles  from  the  shore,  and  in  some  places  the  rent  was  about 
one  hundred  yards  wide.  In  this  opening  the  whales  were  so  numerous  that  the  har- 
pooners  only  selected  the  largest  fish  for  capture.     During  the  excitement,  and  when

passing  anotlicr  boat,  llie  liladc  of  one  of  their  bide  oars  unshipped  the  doctor's  steer- 
ing oar  while  lie  was  pushing  it  from  him,  and,  h)sing  his  bahmce,  he  fell  into  the 
water,  lie,  however,  did  not  feel  the  least  alarmed,  hut  at  oiice'struck  out  for  the  ice, 
and,  drying  his  clothes  as  well  as  he  could,  walked  to  his  ship,  which  was  anchored 
about  two  miles  away,  in  the  field  ice,  and  soon  found  himself  on  deck,  not  much  the 
worse  for  his  ducking.  In  the  spring  of  1H35,  having  passed  his  examination  before 
the  Faculty  of  Physicians  and  Surgeons  of  CUasgow,  he  returned  to  Dundee  and 
married  Margaret  McDonald,  the  only  daughter  of  Duncan  McDonald,  a  well-known 
manufacturer  of  that  town,  and  Margaret  Rose,  his  wife.  To  Miss  McDonald  he  had 
been  betrothed  for  several  years.  Me  then  became  House  Surgeon  in  the  Dundee 
Royal  Infirmary,  and  having  filled  this  position  for  about  two  years,  gave  il  up,  and 
ciUered  into  private  practice,  his  office  bemg  in  the  same  house  in  which  he  was 
born  and  married.  In  1843,  Dr.  Wanless,  accompanied  by  his  wife,  mother,  brother, 
and  sisters,  with  their  husbands,  emigrated  to  Canada,  and  uliimalely  settled  in 
London,  Ontario.  While  in  this  city  the  doctor  built  uj)  a  good  practice,  and  as 
Coroner  for  the  City  of  London  and  County  of  Middlesex  he  was  highly  spoken  of  by 
the  jjress  for  the  luminous  and  logical  way  in  which  he  presented  evidence  to  his 
jurors.  In  1S49,  he  received  his  license  from  the  Ct)llege  of  Physicians  and  Surgeons 
of  Lower  Canada.  One  day,  in  1859,  as  he  was  walking  along  a  street  in  London  to 
visit  a  patient,  he  observed  Dr.  l!ull,  a  honueopalhisl,  give  some  pellets  to  a  man  who 
had  fallen  out  of  a  two-storey  window.  Having  a  prejudice  against  hoinoeopalh}',  he 
accosted  Dr.  IjuII  in  these  words,  "  Don't  you  think  shame  of  yourself  in  giving  that 
useless  trash  to  a  man  in  that  condition  ?"  Dr.  Bull  rose  up,  in  a  defensive  attitude, 
and  said,  "  1  have  always  taken  you  for  a  sensible  man,  and  instead  of  acting  as  you 
have  done  in  your  persecutions  of  us,  why  don't  you  try  to  test  our  remedies  accord- 
ing to  the  law  of  cure  ?  1  will  give  you  some  (jf  our  books  to  read,  and  also  some  of 
our  medicines  for  thai  jjurpose."  Dr.  Wanless  accepted  the  offer,  and  took  the  books 
and  medicines,  thinking  that  he  would  be  able  to  expose  what  he  then  thought  was 
a  humbug.  After  studying  the  princii)le  of  honneopalhy  for  some  time  he  gave  the 
medicines  to  some  of  his  patients,  strictly  according  to  the  ])rincipks  of  homteopathy, 
beginning  with  some  cases  which  had  resisted  the  alloijathic  treatment  under  his  own 
care,  and  that  of  some  of  die  ablest  men  in  the  country,  keeping  a  strict  account  of 
the  symptoms  and  disease,  and  the  symptoms  and  pathogeny  of  what  the  medicine 
would  produce  on  the  healthy  body,  and  after  carefully  testing  this  method  of  prac- 
tice for  nearly  two  years,  he  found  that,  instead  of  persecuting  the  liomceopathisis,  he 
would  have  to  become  a  homoeopalhist  himself.  After  thorough  conviction  of  its 
benefits  to  his  patients,  like  Paul  with  the  Christians,  and  in  order  to  carry  out  the 
practice  of  homteopathy  with  more  efficiency,  he  ceased  from  practice  in  London,  and 
devoted  himself  to  renewed  study  at  the  age  of  fifty  years,  and  obtained  the  degree  of 
Bachelor  of  Medicine  from  the  L^niversity  of  Toronto  in  1861,  and  the  degree-  of 
T)octor  in  Medicine  from  the  same  University  in  the  following  year,  1862.  II  ihen, 
in  order  to  have  a  wider  field  to  labor  in,  went  to  Montreal  (but  before  leaving  .laving

Dr.  Wanlcss  has  soui,'ht  to  conserve  the  good,  and  set  aside  the  effete  and  worthless. 
Both  in  London  and  Montreal,  by  his  s|)iriled  antl  able  contributions  to  the  press,  he 
has  done  much  to  popularize  honneopalhy,  and  establish  its  ])rlnie  tenets.  He  was 
instrumental  in  procuring  an  Act  of  the  Provincial  Parliament  of  (Quebec,  in  favor  of 
HonKcopathic  lulucation,  and  with  |)ower  to  grant  licenses  to  those  who  had  studied 
according  to  the  curriculum  specified  by  the  Act.  and  who  had  passed  a  satisfictory 
examination  before  the  appointed  IJoard  of  l"".xaminers,  as  he  always  'jpheld  that 
homceopaths,  as  well  as  allopaths,  should  be  able  to  show  that  they  possessed  a 
thorough  medical  education  and  training.  Dr.  Wanless  is  nominal  Dean  of  the 
Faculty  of  the  College  of  Homceopathic  Pliysicinns  and  Surgeons  of  Montreal,  and 
Professor  of  the  Practice  of  Physic  and  one  of  the  Examiners  of  the  College.  He

no  desire  to  scold  and  burn  those  who  differ  from  him.  except  to  show  lliem  their

DUNCAN  McNAB  McEACIIRAX,  F.K.C.V.S., 

"  Princii'.vl  of  Montreal  Veterinary  College,  Chief  Lispector  of  Stock,  etc.,  was  born 
at  Campbeltown,  .\rgyleshire,  Scotland,  on  the  27th  October,  1841.  He  is  the  olde  t 
son  of  the  late  l^avid  McEachran,  who  for  many  years  was  a  member  of  the  Town 
Council,  and  for  five  years  j^receding  his  death  was  senior  liailie  of  Campbeltown, 
The  fiimily  is  one  of  the  oldest  in  Kintyre,  descended  from  McEachran  of  Killellan 
and  Penygowan.  The  Ionic  cross  of  Campbeltown,  one  of  the  oldest  in  Scotland, 
bears  the  names  of  Edward  and  Malcolm  McEachran,  and  the  family  tombstones 
which  are  found  within  the  ruins  c&gt;f  the  old  church  of  St.  Kiarian,  date  back  as  far  as 
the  fourteenth  century,  David  McEachran  is  also  buried  here.  Duncan  received 
his  earlier  education  in  the  schools  of  his  native  place,  and  at  the  age  of  sevc  ntcen 
entered  on  his  professional  studies  at  Edinburgh,  under  the  late  Professor  Dick.  In 
the  autumn  of  1862,  he  came  to  Canada,  and  took  up  his  abode  in  Woodstock, 
Onta-io,  where  he  practised  his  profession  for  neatly  three  years  with  marked  success, 
at  the  same  time  being  engaged  during  part  of  the  winter  in  giving  lectures  at  Toronto, 
and  by  this  means  rendered  valuable  service  in  the  establishment  of  the  Veterinary 


246  GAZETTEER    OV   MONTREAL. 

College  in  that  city.     During  his  residence  in  Woodstock,  he  contributed  in  various 
ways  to  the  advancement  of  his  jDrofession,  by  lectures  at  farmers'  meetings,  by  con- 
tributions to  tlie  agricultural  press,  and  by  the  publication  of  a  manual  of  veterinary 
science.     The  work  on  the   "Canadian  Horse  and  his  ])isea^ies,"  under  the  joint 
editorship  of  himself  and  his  friend,  Professor  Andrew  Smith,  of  the  Toronto  Veter- 
inary College,  soon  ran  through  two  editions,  and  although  a  third  edition  is  now 
called  for,  Professor  McEachran  will  not  consent  to  its  issue,  as  he  fondly  hopes  to 
find  time  in  the  near  future  to  publish  a  larger  work  on  the  same  subject.     In  1S66, 
he  left  Ontario  and  settled  in  Montreal,  but  before  he  left  for  that  city,  the  IJoard  of 
Agriculture  for  Upper  Canada  passed  a  very  complimentary  resolution,  expressing 
regret  at  his  departure,  and  he  was  entertained  by  a  large  number  of  his  friends  at  a 
public  dinner  at  Woodstock.     On  his  arrival  in  Montreal,  thanks  to  his  good  rejjuta- 
tion  which  had  preceded  him,  and  the  induence  of  his  numerous  friends,  his  success 
was  speedily  assured.     Through  the  intluence  of  the  late  Major  Campbell,  President 
of  the  Board  of  Agriculture,  aided  by  Principal  (now  .Sir)  J.  W.  Dawson,  and  the  laie 
G.  W.  Campbell,  Dean  of  the  Medical  Faculty  ofMcGill  University,  an  arrangement 
was  made  for  Professor  McEachran   to  deliver  a  course  of  lectures  on  Veterinary 
Science,  in  connection  with  the  Medical  School,  which  was  the  commencement  of  the 
now  widely  known  Montreal  Veterinary  College.     In   1875,  the  present  commodious 
College  buildings  were  erected  on  Union  Avenue,  at  tiie  expense  of  the  founder  and 
Principal,  the  Government  guaranteeing  $1,800  per  annum  toward  its  expenses  for  ten 
years,  with  the  privilege  of  sending  to  it  thirteen  French  and  seven  English  students 
annually  free.     This  College  is  now  considered  tiie  first  of  its  kind  in  America,  and 
justly  ranks  high,  even  when  compared  with  many  of  tlie  schools  in  Europe,  owing  to 
the  appreciation  of  its  head  for  thorough  education.     While  the  Veterinary  .Schools 
at  Toronto  and  New  York  admitted  students  without  matriculation,  and  graduated 
them  in  two  sessions,  here  a  matriculation  is  required,  and  the  course  extends  over 
three  sessions  of  six  months  each.     This  i)lan  was  adopted  by  the  Montreal  College 
before  the  English  schools  ;  even  the  Royal  Veterinary  College  of  England  was  led 
by  the  Montreal  school  in  this   very  important  matter.     Professor  McEachran  has 
associated  with   him  in  teaching  tlie   learned  Principal  and  Professors  of   McGill 
University,  whose  classes  his  students  attend  for  collateral  studies.     Year  by  year 
since  the  establishment   of  tiiis   college,  its   progress  has  been  most  marked  in  the 
number  and  educational  standing  of  the  pupils,  and  students  have  been  attracted  to 
it  from  all  parts  of  the  United  States  and  Canada.  A  Veterinary  Medical  Association 
has  been  established  in  connection  with  the  College,  for  the  reading  (,f  ])apers   and 
the  discussion  of  professional  and  kindred  subjects,  and  a  well-fin'nished  library,  C(mi- 
taining  most  of  the  old  works,  and  all  the  new  ones,   embraced  in  veterinary  litera- 
ture,   has  been   added  to  the  College,  mainly  through   the  efforts   of  its  energetic 
Princii)al.     Professor  McEachran,  during  the  past  few  years,  has  contributed  man\ 
valuable  articles  to  professional  journals  and  the  agricultural  press,  as  well  as    1)\ 
public  lectures,  on  his  favorite   theme.     In   1875,  he  earnestly    pressed   upon  ihe

attention  of  the  Dominion  Government,  the  necessity  for  theestahlishment  of  a  quar- 
antine system,  to  prevent  the  importation  of  certain  cattle  diseases  from  Europe,  where 
they  were  then  prevaiHng  to  a  deplorable  extent.     Acting  on  his  advice  the  Govern- 
ment created,  in  April,  1876,  a  quarantine  station  at  Point  Levis,  Quebec,  and  made 
the  Professor  Chief  Inspector  for  the  Dominion,  and  this  position  he  still  continues  to 
occupy.     In  January,  1879,  he  was   sent  l)y  the  Dominion  Government  to  the  United 
States,  to  investigate   the    lung-plague — jjleuro-pneumonia — and  visited  New  York, 
Long    Island,   New  Jersey,  rennsylvania,  Maryland,  Virginia,  and  the   District  of 
Columbia  ;  and  on  his  return  he  reported  the  prevalence  of  this  serious  disease  in 
all  the  States  he  had  visited.     The  result    was   that  shorly  afterwards  an   embargo 
was  placed  on  the  importation  of  all  cattle   from  the  United  Suites  to  Canada  and 
Great  Britain,  requiring  that  they  should  be  slaughtered   at  the    port  of  debarkation, 
within  fourteen  days  after  landing,     'i'his  action  of  the  IJritish  Government  entailed 
a  heavy  loss  on  cattle  exported  from   the   United  Stales,  but  Canada,  owing  to  her 
freedom  from  the  disease,  and  the  perfect  condition  of   her  quarantine  system,  be- 
came a  gainer  in  proportion  to  a  large  amount.     Professor  McKachran's  name  will 
ever  be  associated  with  the  early  history  of  the  export  cattle  trade  of  Canada,  as  one 
who,  at  the  proper  moment,  gave    sound  advice  to    the  Government,  which,  being 
promptly  acted   upon,  helped  in  these  early  days  to  assist  a  trade  that  has  since 
grown    to  vast  proportions.     The  efficiency  of  the   quarantine  for  cattle  under  his 
management  has  been   thoroughly    tested  on  two  occasions,  viz.,   1885,  when  the 
contagious  disease,  "foot  and    mouth,"  or    vesicular  epizootic,  was  twice  brought 
into  the  quarantine  from  Cxreat  Britain,  so  thorougli  was  the  quarantine  that  not  only 
did  it  not  extend  beyond  but  it  did  not  even  affect  puy  other  cattle,  of  which  there 
were  several  hundred  within  the  enclosure.     The  prompt  and  effective   manner  in 
which   pleuro-piieumonia  was  dealt  with  in  1886,  when  that  fell  destroyer  was  im- 
ported in  a  herd  of  Galloways,  proved  beyond  doubt  the  efficiency  of  the  quarantine, 
and  the  ability  of  the  inspectors  to  deal  with  contagious  diseases.     If  Canada  to  day 
is  free  from  contagious  disease,  it  is  due  in  a  great  measure  to  his  energy  and  know- 
ledge of  disease.     In  acknowledgment  of  his  professional  attainments  he  was  elected 
one  of  the  original    Fellows  of  the  Royal  College   of  Veterinary  Surgeons,  on  that 
body  being  raised  to  the  rank  of  a  University  in   1875,  being  the  only  one  in  Canada 
on  whom  that  honor  was  conferred.  He  has  been  intimately  connected  with  the  cattle 
ranching  business  in  the   District  of  Alberta,  Senator  Cochrane    and  he   being  the 
pioneers  in  that  business  on  a  large  scale  in  Canada.     Together  they  visited  Alberta 
in  1881,  going  via  the  Missouri  River  to  Fort  Benton,    thence  driving  across  the 
plains  to  where  Calgary  is  now  built.      On  his  return  he  published  a  series  of  inter- 
esting letters,  being  a  narrative  of  his  trip,  and  description  of  the  country.     He  was 
Vice-President   of  the   Ct)chrane  Ranche  Co.,  till    18S3,  when  he  became  General 
Manager  of  the  VValrond  Cattle  Ranche  Co.,  of  which  Sir  John  Walrond,   Bart.,  is 
President,  and  which  is  now  the  largest  and  one  of  the  most  successful  ranches  in 
Canada.     Professor  McEachran  was  married  on  the  9th  of  June,    1S68,  to  Esther,

ROHERT  NELSON,  M.I)., 

AVas  horn  January,  1794,  and  at  an  early  age  was  apprenticed  to  tlie  late  celebrated 
Doctor  Arnoldi,  of  .\[ontreal.  While  yet  in  his  youth  he  was  appointed  surgeon  to  a 
regiment  called  the  ''  Indian  Warriors,"  and  sei  ved  during  the  War  of  1S12.  He  was 
one  of  the  most  distinguished  and  celebrated  doctors  of  the  day.  It  is  told  that  on 
one  occasion  an  influential  patient  of  hi:;  who  had  a  ball  lodged  in  his  thigh  for  a 
considerable  time,  and  which  I)r,  Nelson  was  unable  to  extract,  went  to  England  to 
consult  some  of  the  medical  celebrities  there.  These,  on  ascertaining  who  had 
attended  him  in  Canada,  said,  "  if  Dr.  Nelson  is  unable  to  do  anything  for  you,  we 
are  |)erfectly  sure  we  can  do  nothing."  The  gentleman  returned  and  died  without 
the  bail  having  been  extracted.  Having  been  prominently  mixed  up  with  the  politics 
of  the  day,  after  a  warm  contest,  the  Doctor  was  elected  in  iiS^y,  conjointly  with  M. 
Papineau,  to  represent  the  City  of  Montreal  in  Parliament.  He  soon,  however,  with- 
drew from  that  position  to  devote  his  time  solely  to  his  profession,  which  he  loved 
beyond  all  other  things.  He  did  not  take  an  active  part  in  1837  ;  but  he  was  arrested 
and  cast  into  prison.     After  a  time  he  was  admitted  to  bail. 

In  1838,  the  most  eventful  period  of  his  career,  he  played  a  conspicuous  part  in 
the  affairs  of  the  country.  Being  induced  by  a  number  of  dissatisfied  persons  of 
Canada,  as  well  as  some  "  sympathizers  "  from  the  States,  to  take  up  arms  against 
his  country,  he  entered  madly  as  chief  into  the  chimerical  scheme  of  invading 
Canada,  which  })roved  abortive  to  those  engaged  in  it.  His  property  was  sold  at  a 
great  sacrifice.  He  himself,  a  fugitive  from  justice,  went  to  California,  were  he 
amassed  a  considerable  fortune.  He  died  at  his  country  seat  on  Staten  Island, 
N.V.,  in  March,  1873,  aged  eighty-four,  leaving  a  large  fortune  to  his  son  and  suc- 
cessor, Dr.  iLiigene  Nelson,  of  New  York.

HENRY  LYISLVN. 

'SIr.  Hkxrv  Lyaian,  of  ]\[cTavish  street,  is  now  in  his  seventy-ninth  year,  nearly 
the  whole  of  which  has  been  i)assed  in  this  city.  Mr.  Lyman  entered  upon  his 
business  career  in  1829,  in  his  sixteenth  year,  in  connection  with  the  firm  of  Hedge 
iv:  Lyman,  druggists,  St.  Paul  street.  With  the  view  to  public  usefulness  he  early 
joined  John  Luckiiis'  fire  company,  called  the  "  Property  Protecting  Eire  Company,'' 
to  protect  portable  property,  and  prevent  pilfering  at  fires.  He  about  the  same 
time  joined  the  "  Philomathic  Society,''  a  small  club,  formed  for  literary  discussions, 
of  which  he  is  now  probably  the  sole  representative.  In  1837,  Mr.  Lyman  joined 
the  ranks  of  the  "  .Montreal  Rilles,"  under  the  command  of  Jjieutenant-Colonel, 
the  late  Henry  Griffin,  Notary  Public,  and  both  as  private  and  commissioned  officer, 
saw  active  service  during  the  Rebellion. 

Subsequently  he  assisted  his  brother  and  partner,  the  late  Benjamin  Lyman,  in 
the  formation  of  a  volunteer  fire  engine  company,  the  "  Union,"  which  proved  a 
model  company,  and  its  improved  engine,  the  first  of  its  kind,  by  emulation  led  to 
substantial  improvement  in  the  then  existing  civic  fire  department.  Mr.  Lyman 
took  an  active  part  in  the  establishment  of  the  "  American  Eree  School,"  the  late 
Rev.  G.  W.  Perkins,  of  the  American  Presbyterian  Church,  taking  the  initiative  in 
the  movement.  A  governmt;nt  grant  in  aid  was  obtained  from  the  Government  of 
Lord  Sydenham,  and  voluntary  subscriptions  provided  the  balance  of  funds  necessary. 
The  school  su[)plied  a  crying  want,  was  a  success  from  the  beginning,  and  continued 
its  operations  for  many  years,  very  quietly  and  without  ostentation,  Init  with  increas- 
ing usefulness.  Li  1845,  '^f'-  Lyman  assisted  in  the  direction  of  the  •'  Montreal 
Building  Society,"  which  was  the  first  institution  of  the  sort  in  the  city,  and  so  far 
as  is  known  only  one  other  member  of  the  board  survives  at  this  date.  The  society 
was  woinid  up  under  Mr.  Lyman's  presidency  in  1856.  In  1851,  Mr.  Lyman  was  a 
meml)er  of  the  local  commission  for  the  great  London  Exhibition  under  the  pre- 
side y  of  the  late  Prince  Consort,  and  received  a  diploma  and  medal  "  for  services." 
About  this  period,  associated  with  others,  all  of  whom  have  passed  away,  Mr.  Lyman 


252  GAZETTEER    OF    MONTREAL. 

assisted  in  the  formrtion  of  the  "Canada  Sunday  Scliool  Union,"  an  organization  for 
the  promotion  of  mission  schools  in  Upi)cr  and  Lower  Canada,  In  1S53,  Mr.  Lyman 
was  elected  a  member  of  the  City  Council  from  the  West  Ward,  where  he  rendered 
yeom.in  service,  more  especially  in  th*.  establishment  of  the  then  new  water  works, 
tne  introduction  of  the  fire  alarm  telegrajjh,  which  added  to  the  value  of  all  insur- 
able property  for  all  lime  to  coniL^and  also  in  the  establishment  of  the  Mount  Royal 
Park,  a  boon  of  inestima!)le  value  to  the  citizens.  Mr.  Lyman  represented  the  Centre 
Ward  in  1X67,  and  retired  in  1870  with  a  vote  of  thanks  from  the  Fire  Committee 
and  Council.  In  1.S56,  Mr.  Lyman  assisted  as  honorary  treasurer  for  the  celebration 
of  tiic  opening  of  the  Grand  Trunk  Railway,  a  very  noticeable  event,  and  numerously 
attended  by  prominent  persons  from  Ontario  and  the  neighboring  United  Stales. 
Li  1863,  &gt;L-.  Lyman  was  Vice-President  of  the  Board  of  Trade,  and  represented  it  on 
the  Harbor  Commission.  The  other  members  were  the  Hon.  John  Young,  the  Hon. 
Jean  I,.  Beaudry,  Thomas  Cramp  and  Alex.  M.  Delisle,  all  of  whom  are  dead.  He 
filled  the  ofiicc  of  President  of  the  Board  of  Trade  in  1S81-1882. 

P&gt;t'lieving  that  the  Lisolvent  or  Bankrupt  Law  was  injurious  to  the  commercial 
interests  of  the  country,  he  took  an  active  and  successful  part  in  effecting  its  repeal. 

Mr.  Lyman  is  a  Life  Governor  of  the  House  of  Liduslry  and  Refuge,  and  a  life 
member  of  the  Mechanics'  Listitute  and  of  the  Natural  History  Society. 

In  1867,  he  was  elected  a  member  of  the  board  of  the  Citizens'  Insurance  Com- 
pany, and  succeeded  the  late  Sir  Hugh  Allan  in  tiie  presidency  at  his  decea&gt;^e  in  1881. 
In  1876,  Mr.  Lyman  took  an  active  jiart  as  chairman  of  the  building  committee  of 
Emmanuel  Congregational  Church.  Mr.  Lyman  has  now  retired  from  many  of  the 
active  labors  which  occupied  his  time  and  energies  in  former  days,  but  he  is  still 
anytliing  but  an  idle  man,  attending  regularly  to  business  and  other  pursuits,  being 
the  senior  partner  of  the  firm  of  Lyman  Sons  &amp;  Co.,  Montreal,  and  Lyman  Bros.  &amp; 
Co.,  Toronto. 

HON.  HORACE  ARCHAMHAULT

VVM.  EVAN'S. 

Tiiii  subject  of  our  sketcli  was  one  of  the  most  well-known  agriculturists  of  J.owcr 
Canada.  Nearly  thirty-five  years  ago  the  old  gentleman,  full  of  honors  and  patriotism, 
passed  away  fiom  this  busy  scene,  but  his  endeavors  to  elevate  the  standard  of  agri- 
culture in  this  Province  and  to  raise  the  position  of  a  farmer  (the  real  bone  and 
muscle  of  any  country,  except  a  purely  manufacturing  one)  still  live  and  are  observ- 
able, as  annually,  the  various  country  and  other  e.xiiibitiuns  and  cattle  shows  come 
round.  Improved  breeds  of  animals,  and  latest  styles  of  agricultural  implements, 
better  barns  and  stables,  a  much  improved  system  of  planting  and  reaping,  and  many 
other  things  have  all  been  the  offspring  of  Mr.  Evans'  endeavors  to  promote  the 
agricultural  interests  of  this  Province.  He  was  for  many  years  the  Secretary  of  the 
Agricultural  Society  of  Lower  Canada.  A  contemporary  writing  of  him  at  the  lime 
of  his  death,  1857,  says:  '  ^^  '^^''^  i^een  our  fortune  to  meet  few  worthier  or  more 
patriotic  men  than  he,  few  more  diligent  in  the  ijromotion  to  the  uttermost  of  his 
pbility  of  the  prosperity  of  this  his  adopted  country."  I'jithusiastically  devoted  to 
agricultural  pursuits,  he  spent  over  forty  years  as  an  agriculturist  in  Canada.  He 
was  also  editor  of  the  Agricultural  Journal ^  published  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Society  of  which  he  was  Secretary.  During  his  latter  years,  after  retiring  from  the 
Secretaryship,  he  was  a  frequent  contributor  to  the  columns  of  \.\\&lt;i  Journal.  Almost 
the  last  words  he  wrote  were  these :  '"  While  it  may  be  the  will  of  Cod  to  spare  me  I 
shall  persevere  in  the  good  cause  of  endeavoring  to  promote  the  improvement  of 
agriculture  in  Canada."  Kven  while  the  good  old  man  wrote  these  words  the  vow  so 
to  speak  was  fulfilled.  He  died  rather  suddenly,  though  he  had  been  ailing  some 
time  previously.  "  Full  of  years,  enjoying  the  esteem  of  all  who  knew  him,  and  sur- 
rounded by  a  large  circle  of  tried  friends,  he  has  passed  peacefully  away — a  man 
whom  many  loved  while  living,  many  will  regret  his  death;  one  who  strove  faithfully 
to  do  his  duty  in  that  state  of  life  in  which  it  pleased  Cod  to  place  him." 

His  sons  are  well-known  merchants  of  Montreal.  One  is  in  the  coal  and  wood 
business  ;  the  second  died  not  long  ago,  well  respected  by  his  fellow  citizens;  whilst 
the  third  owns  the  well-known  agricultural  implement  and  seed  depot  opi)osite 
St.  Ann's  Market,  and  whose  name  to  fiirmers  in  all  parts  of  Canada  is  almost  as 
familiar  as  his  father's  was  of  old.  He  is  also  a  tried  and  intelligent  agriculturist 
and  seedsman. 

MATTHEW  HUTCHINSON 

Was  born  in  Halifax  County,  Nova  Scotia,  29th  October,  1842.  He  is  the  grandson 
of  a  United  Empire  Loyalist,  who  emigrated  there  after  the  War  of  Indepen- 
dence in  America.  The  family  afterwards  removed  to  Upper  Canada,  near  Clinton. 
He  was  educated  in  London  Grammar  School  and  McGill  College,  where  he  attained 
his  B.C.L.  degree  in  1873,  being  the  gold  medallist  of  the  year.  He  was  admitted 
to  the  Bar  in  1874,  and  has  ever  since  given  all  his  attention  to  the  duties  of  his 
profession.  In  1879,  he  was  appointed  Associate  Professor  of  McGill  on  Civil 
Procedure,  and  still  retains  the  Chair.

The  suljjcct  oi'tliis  sketch  was  born  on  the  banks  of  l^akc  Mempliremagog,  Province 
of  (Quebec — consecjuently  Dr.  Bernard  is  a  Canadian  by  birlh,  although  wlien  quite 
a  child  he  was  taken  to  tiie  United  States.  There  lie  ol)tained  all  that  could  be 
accjuircd  in  dentistry.  He  practised  about  ten  years  in  the  Southern  States,  and  in 
1.S40  caine  North  on  account  of  his  health.  Previous  to  his  leaving  the  South  he 
had  married  a  lady  of  Maryland.  He  spent  a  short  time  at  Niagara  and  other 
parts  of  Ontario,  but  in  1S41  came  to  Montreal,  where  he  lived  till  his  death. 
There  were  only  three  dentists  in  Montreal  then,  the  naniiis  of  wiiom  few  of  the 
present  generation  have  ever  heard  of.  The  three  dentists  were  called  Spooner, 
Logan  and  Scripture.  In  1844,  when  Mcjntreal  was  the  seat  of  (lovernment,  Dr. 
JJernard  endeavored  to  im])rove  the  condition  of  his  profession  by  legislation,  but 
the  burning  of  the  Parliament  House  with  the  Act  containing  the  improved  clauses 
])ut  an  end  to  his  attempts  at  that  time.  He,  however,  persisted  in  his  efforts,  and 
being  strongly  aided  by  the  dentists  of  Montreal  and  Quebec,  finally  succeeded  in 
obtaining  an  Act  of  Incorporation  which  has  greatly  elevated  the  standard  of  ability 
in  iiis  profession  and  made  it  honorable  and  useful.  He  was  api)ointed  the  first 
President  under  the  provisions  of  the  Act,  and,  having  from  time  to  time  afterwards 
been  elected  by  the  Association,  held  the  office.  In  1844,  a  heavy  bereavement  fell 
upon  him  in  the  death  of  his  wife  and  only  child. 

He  was  always  an  active  member  of  the  City  and  its  Council.  In  1858,  he  was 
elected  City  Councillor  for  the  Centre  Ward,  and  for  many  years  represented  that 
Ward.  Among  other  public  matters  in  which  he  took  a  most  active  jKirt  and  interest, 
he  was  President  of  the  Mechanics'  Institute,  one  of  the  founders  of  the  So- 
ciety for  the  Prevention  of  Cruelty  to  Animals,  an  honorary  member  and  dental 
licentiate  of  Ontario,  and  also  of  the  Ontario  Dental  Society.  He  was  successively 
Chairman  of  the  Finance  Committee,  of  the  Police,  and  of  the  new  City  Hall.  He 
is  the  Author  or  the  chief  promoter  of  many  of  the  most  beneficial  by-laws  of  Mon- 
treal, such  as  City  Passenger,  Sunday  Liquor,  Milk  Inspection  and  Tree  Planting  by- 
laws. 

On  the  23rd  of  June,  1873,  he  was  unanimously  elected  to  the  highest  office  in 
the  city  on  the  death  of  Mayor  Cassidy,  and  next  year,  1874,  in  opposition  to  five 
other  candidates,  he  was  again  re-elected  Mayor  of  the  City.  During  his  term 
C)f  office  the  Mountain  Park  was  acquired  by  the  city,  also  the  Dominion 
Square,  the  old  Protestant  Burying  Ground,  Quebec  Gate  Barracks,  St.  Helen's 
Island  and  Logan's  Farm  for  public  purposes.  The  new  City  Hall  was  begun,  and 
many  other  essential  and  recognized  improvements  in  the  Montreal  City  Charter, 
Water  Works,  sanitary  and  other  matters. 

Dr.  Bernard  was  a  Harbor  Commissioner,  a  Director  of  the  Northern  Coloniza- 
tion Railway,  a  Justice  of  the  Peace,  and  one  of  the  License  Commissioners  by  Act 
of  Parliament.  In  politics,  a  Liberal ;  in  religion,  a  Wesleyan.  He  re-married  in 
1 85 1,  and  had  a  family  of  five  sons  and  two  daughters.     He  died  some  years  ago.

WILLIAM  CKAICi  HAYNLS 

Was  born  in  Quebec  in  1.S09,  and  went  lionie  will)  his  parents  in  1815.  He  was  llie 
eldest  of  five  sons,  three  of  whom  entered  the  army.      lie  was  educated  for  the  civil 
service  of  the  Honorable  Kast  India  C!()in])any,   to  which  he   received   his  a|)point- 
ment,  and  went  to  Heylebury  College.  He  was  a  contemporary  there  with  Sir 'i'homas 
Lawrence,  the  late  Governor  (leneral  of  India.      On  the  death  of  his  father  he  gave 
up  his  ai)pointnient,  and  shortly  after  entered  Trinity  College,  Cambridge,  taking  his 
bachelor  of  Arts  degree  in  1X36,  passing  through  the  Divinity  School  with  a  view  to 
Ordination.     In  1839,  he  was  summoned  to  take   his  Master's  degree,  but  conscien- 
tiously declining  the  oath  of  conformity,  the  degree  was  refused.   Having  married  in 
1841  adaughter  of  Dr.  Augustus  Harvey,  of  Cole  Park  in  the  County  of  Wills  ;  in  1843 
lie  came   to  Canada,  and  settled  on   the  lands  purchased  by  his  father   in  1809,  and 
having  arrived,  proceeded  to  Kingsey,  where  he  farmed  extensively  for  twelve  years, 
and  assisted  materially  in   the  introduction  of  improved   breeds  of  cattle   into  the 
neighboring  districts.     In    1856,   on    the   Secretaryship  of  the   Royal    Institution  for 
Advanceu'.ent  of  Learning  being  vacant,  and  being  solicitid  by  his  friends  to  apply, 
the  aiJ])oininient   was  conferred  upon  him  in   May  of  that   year,  rnd  he  held    the 
appointment  to  his   death  ;  and  while  ardently  desiring  the  progress  of  the  estate 
and  welfare  of  the  University,  he  secured  at  the  same  time  a  material  end  he  had  in 
view,  viz.,  the  education  of  his  four  sons,  all  of  whom    took  their  degrees  in  one  or 
other  of  the  Faculties,  being  trained  at  the  High  School  and  graduating  at  McCill 
University.       He  died  some  years  ago. 

The  connection  of  this  family  in  Canada  is  as  far  back  as  the  early  part  of  this 
century.  Major  (leneral  Baynes  was  born  in  the  year  1771,  and  v/as  trained  at  the 
Military  Academy  at  Marlow.  He  was  the  eldest  of  five  sons  ;  the  four  younger 
were  all  educated  at  Woolwich  Academy,  where  their  uncle,  the  late  General  Sir 
John  McLeod,  was  Adjutant  General,  who  married  Lady  Emily  Kerr,  daughter  of 
the  Marquis  of  Lothian,  whose  eldest  son  was  Lieutenant  Colonel  of  the  42nd  High- 
landers, and  fell  leading  the  Forlorn  Hope  at  the  capture  of  Badajos.  They  enlcired 
the  Royal  Artillery  and  served  in  the  Peninsular  war ;  two  of  them  were  in 
the  battle  of  Waterloo.  Major  General  Baynes  received  his  commission  in 
1783  ;  and  after  serving  at  C-ibi altar  and  the  West  Indies  be  became  aide-de- 
camp  to  Major  General  Sir  James  Henry  Craig,  K.C.B. ,  in  1784.  He  was  with 
Sir  James  at  the  taking  of  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope  in  1795,  and  also  at  the 
capture  of  a  Dutch  Force  in  Saldanna  Bay  in  1796,  and  obtained  his  majority 
in  76th  Foot;  he  proceeded  with  Sir  James  to  India,  where  he  served  through 
the  whole  of  that  General's  active  service.  Here  he  married  Anne  Francis,  the 
only  child  of  William  Cator,  of  the  Honorable  Fast  India  Company's  Civil  Ser- 
vice, who  fell  in  the  action  of  the  Kent,  Fast  Indiaman  captured  by  French 
privateers  in  1800.  On  returning  to  England,  in  1803,  he  was  appointed  Lieut.- 
Colonel  of  the  5th  Foot,  and  in  1805  joined  the  Expedition  at  Portsmouth  under 
Sir  James  Craig,  who  again  wishing  his  services  as  his  first  aide-de-camp  he  was 


■3=(J  GA/KTIEKR    Ol'    .\U)MKliAt.. 

placed  on  lialf-pny  and  served  willi  Sir  James  al  (iibr.dtar,  Malta,  Xa[)les  and 
Sicily  milil  1806,  when  the  l'',x[)eiliti()n  returned  to  Kngland.  For  a  long  time 
there  had  been  a  serious  misunderst  indiiifr  with  the  Cabinet  al  Washington,  and 
war  was  considered  nnminenl  with  the  United  Stales;  the  Knglish  (.lovernmenl, 
therefore,  felt  it  was  necessary  to  set  the  Canadas  in  defence.  Upon  the  urgent 
solicitations  of  the  Government,  Sir  James  Craig,  whose  health  was  then  con- 
siderably impaired,  at  that  time  consented  to  come  out  as  the  (iovernor  (ieneral, 
with  the  nomination  of  the  King's  two  aiipoinimenls  of  Adjutant-Ceneral  and 
Quarter  Master  Cieneral  of  Jbitish  North  America;  to  the  Adjutant  Generalshi[) 
Colonel  Haynes  was  appointed,  and  Colonel,  afterwards  Lieutenant  General  Sir 
James  Kemp,  G.C.li.,  to  tlie  (Quarter  Master  Generalship.  They  arrived  in  1807, 
and  took  active  measures  to  carry  out  the  end  in  view.  One  of  them  was  the 
strategical  road,  known  as  the  present  Craig's  road,  that  passes  through  the  East- 
ern Townships,  then  the  only  communication  between  (Quebec  and  that  district. 
The  expenses  of  this  undertaking  were  met  by  the  sale  of  lands  in  the  townships, 
and  the  subject  of  this  memoir  purchased  a  considerable  tract  in  the  Township  of 
Kingsey.  On  the  raising  of  the  Glengarry  Fencibles,  the  Co'')nelship  was  given 
to  the  Adjutant  General.  Sir  James'  health  failing  him  rapidly,  he  begged  to  be 
recalled,  and  was  succeeded  i)y  Lieutenant  General  Sir  George  Prevost,  Uaronet. 
Colonel  Kemp  had  previously  returned  to  England  and  joined  the  ],)uke  of  Wel- 
lington, but  the  Adjutant  General  remained,  and  was  actively  engaged  through  the 
war  of  1812:  among  other  engagements  he  led  the  troops  at  the  taking  of  Sacket's 
LLirbor.  On  Sir  Gordon  Drummond  succeeding  Sir  George  Prevost,  General 
Uaynes,  being  earnestly  pressed  to  attend  the  trial  of  Sir  George  Prevost,  returned 
to  J''-ngland,  and  jieace  being  shortly  after  declared  his  military  services  closed. 
The  General  died  in  1829. 

VICTOR    IIL'DON 

Was  born  at  •■  Riviere  Quelle"  in  1812,  his  iather  being  a  farmer  of  that  place. 
He  came  to  Montreal  at  the  age  of  iwenty-t'ive,  and  has  ever  since  lived  here.  He 
early  commenced  his  career  in  the  grocery  trade,  and  rapidly,  by  strict  attention  to 
business,  acquired  a  large  fortune.  No  man  can  better  claim  the  name  of  patriot 
than  \'ictor  Hudon.  Victor  by  name,  he  has  been  victorious  over  many  difficulties, 
and  struggled  on  to  affluence  and  success.  Well  does  a  man  deserve  a  niche  in  his 
country's  history,  who  at  the  allotted  term  of  man's  life  nobly  began  such  a  patriotic 
enterprise  as  Mr.  Hudon  did,  in  building  the  extensive  mills  which  once  bore  his 
name  in  Hochelaga,  and  endeavoring  to  bring  back  his  countrymen  from  the  United 
States  to  work  in  their  own  land  to  emigrate  no  more  to  other  scenes  of  labor. 

Mr.  Hudon  is  a  Director  of  the  Jacques  Cartier  Bank.  As  a  good  Christian  he 
has  given  no  less  than  three  sons  to  the  C'hurch,  who  are  priests  in  the  Jesuits 
College  of  St.  ^Liry.  He  has  always  refused  all  positions  in  the  City  Council  and  in 
the  Government  of  the  country.  And  now,  after  many  misfortunes  in  business,  still 
appears,  as  he  has  ever  been,  victor  over  all.

C.  S.  CHERRIER,  Q.C.,  LL.D. 

This  well-known  citizen  of  Montreal  was  born  at  Repentigny,  22nd  July,  1798. 
His  father  was  poor,  but  the  son  had  for  his  protection  a  man  who  occupied  the  first 
rank  in  the  annals  of  his  country,  the  Hon.  Denis  Benjamin  Viger,  son  of  Denis 
Viger,  into  whose  house  young  Cherrier  had  been  received. 

At  the  time  the  celebrated  Mr.  Roque  was  principal  of  the  Montreal  College, 
the  subject  of  our  sketch  was  a  student  under  him.  After  passing  his  curriculum, 
he  entered  the  Law  office  of  his  patron,  Hon.  D.  B.  Viger,  and,  in  course  of  time, 
was  received  as  an  advocate,  25th  August,  1822.  Mr.  Cherrier  entered  society  in 
company  with  one  of  the  most  distinguished  advocates  of  the  time,  Louis  Michel 
Viger,  who  is  generally  known  by  the  name  of  Le  Beau  Viger.  In  1827,  Attorney 
General  Stuart  was  beaten  at  Sorel  by  VVolfred  Nelson,  the  Liberal  candidate,  and 
the  whole  power  of  the  bureaucracy  was  levelled  against  many  of  the  electors,  who 
were  accused  of  perjury.  Mr.  Cherrier  defended  them  in  routine,  and  they  were  all 
acquitted. 

In  the  following  year.  Walker,  of  the  Canadian  Spectator,  Duvernay  of  the 
Gazette,  Samuel  Nelson,  and  M.  Lee,  of  Quebec,  also  Charles  Mondelet  of  Three 
Rivers,  were  all  arrested  and  brought  before  the  Tribunals,  for  writing  seditious  libels 
against  the  administration  of  Lord  Dalhousie.  The  question  of  the  illegality  of  the 
composition  of  the  petit  jury,  impannelled  for  the  trial  of  Mr.  Waller,  was  success- 
fully pleaded  in  the  Court  of  King's  Bench  by  Cherrier,  Walker  and  Dominique 
Mondelet,  and  ended  in  the  acquittal  of  Walker. 

Mr.  Cherrier  was  associated  with  Mr.  L.  H.  Viger  from  1832  to  1834;  with  M. 
Laberge  from  1835  ^o  ^^4^  5  with  Chas.  Mondelet,  afterwards  Judge,  from  1841  to 
i860  ;  and  also  for  some  time  with  the  late  Sir  A.  A.  Dorion  and  Wilfrid  Dorion, 
afterwards  Judge.  Mr.  Cherrier  married,  in  1833,  Dame  Veuve  Coursol,  mother  of 
the  well-known  Judge,  lately  deceased.  All  the  honors  which  the  Montreal  advocates 
are  wont  to  confer  on  their  most  distinguished  confreres  they  conferred  on  Mr. 
Cherrier.  He  was  the  Batonnier  of  the  Bar  of  Montreal,  and  the  University  of  St. 
John,  Fordliam,  New  York,  conferred  on  him  the  degree  of  LL.D.,  Doctor  of  Laws. 
He  was  decorated  by  Pope  Pius  IX.,  on  the  occasion  of  his  great  speech  on  the 
temporal  power  of  the  Papacy,  a  speech  remarkable  in  every  way,  and  wliich  he 
delivered  in  the  Notre  Dame  Church. 

In  the  troublous  times  of  1837-3S  the  young  advocate,  with  his  friend  D.  B. 
Viger,  were  both  arrested  and  lodged  in  gaol  for  high  treason.  He  was  amongst  the 
very  first  names  marked  off,  and  among  the  first  commitments  signed  by  P.  C. 
Leclere,  Police  Magistrate;  but,  afterwards,  he  was  allowed  out  on  bail.  On  tlie 
fiftieth  year  of  his  profession  a  great  banquet  was  given  him  in  Montreal.  A  fine 
address  was  presented  to  him  by  his  confreres  and  citizens.  The  orators  that  evening 
were  of  the  most  distinguished  ranks:  Judges  Monk,  Mondelet,  Loranger,  Coursol, 
and  Armstrong,  Mr.  Doherty  (afterwards  Judge),  who  was  then  Batonnier  of  the  Bar»

and  who  presided  on  the  occasion.  Hon.  Mr,  Dorion  (afterwards  Sir  A.  A.  and  Chief 
Justice),  Mr.  T.acoste  (now  Chief  Justice),  and  Messrs.  Hunter,  Cassidy,  and  J.  A. 
Chapleau.  The  last  two  made  stirring  speeches  in  reply  to  the  "  Health  of  the 
Ladies,"  "  I^e  premier  en  sa  qualile  de  vieux  gar(;on  actuel,  I'autre  en  sa  qualite 
de  futur  vieux  gargon  deja  pas  mal  avance." 

Let  me  finish  this  short  sketch  of  Mr,  Cherricr's  life  in  die  words  which  I  used 
in  his  sketch  seventeen  years  ago,  for  the  sentiments  were  unchanged  to  his  death, 

"  La.  vie  de  M.  Cherrier  offre  le  spectacle  d'une  riche  nature  perfectionnee  par  le 
sentiment  religieux,  illuminee  par  le  tlambeau  de  la  foi.  C'est  grace  a  cette  lumiere 
qu'il  a  pu  marcher  toujours  si  droit  dans  la  voie  du  bien,  pratiquer  toutes  les  vertus, 
remplir  si  parfaitement  tous  ses  devoirs  envers  Dieu  et  envers  la  societe. 

Quoiqu'on  en  dise,  la  philosophie  seule  formera  difficilement  un  honnete  homme 
comme  I\[.  Cherrier,  un  homme  dont  la  viedepuis  les  ardeurs  de  lajeunesse  jusqu'aux 
graces  de  la  vieillesse  est  un  enchainement  de  bonnes  actions,  d'actes  de  vertu," 

WILLIAM  HENDERSON 

Was  born  at  Derannanning,  County  Fermanagh,  Ireland,  ist  June,  1810,  He  was 
of  Scotch  descent.  He  came  to  Que])ecwilh  his  father,  David  Henderson,  in  June, 
1820.  Afterwards  he  was  engaged  in  the  firm  of  A.  Jackson  &amp;  Co.,  lumber  mer- 
chants of  that  city.  At  the  end  of  two  years  he  entered  into  partnership  with  Messrs. 
Jackson  and  McAlpinc.  In  1828,  he  went  into  partnership  witli  his  father,  when  they 
commenced  manufacturing  lumber  on  the  St.  Anne,  Batiscan  and  Ciiamplain  Rivers, 
sixty  miles  west  of  Quebec.  At  tliis  time  he  also  kept  a  general  store  at  Ste.  Gene- 
vieve de  Batiscan,  wh'ch  he  continued  till  1840.  He  was  at  the  same  time,  from 
1830  to  1838,  the  Superintendent  of  Allan,  Gilmour  &amp;  Co.'s  Wolfe-Cove  and  Ship- 
ping Department,  Quebec.  In  1842,  he  came  to  Montreal,  and  started  in  business. 
In  connection  with  the  lumber  and  timber  trade  he  started  steam  saw  and 
planing  mills  and  a  box  factory  on  the  Lachine  Canal  Bank.  These  large  mills 
were  all  burned  down  in  1874,  but  in  January,  1875,  were  rebuilt,  and  are  now  the 
finest  and  largest  saw  and  planing  mills  in  the  city,  doing  an  immense  amount  of 
business  during  the  year.  In  1872,  he  also  built  steam  saw  mills  in  I'Assomption  for 
the  manufacture  of  sawn  lumber,  where  he  had  many  miles  of  well  wooded  limits 
extending  on  the  different  rivers  round  about  the  mills.  Almost  all  the  produce  of 
these  mills  was  for  the  English  and  American  markets,  although  a  quantity  was 
sent  to  South  America.  He  owned  several  boats  for  shipping  his  lumber  and  timber, 
all  of  which  industries  gave  employment  to  a  large  number  of  men. 

Mr.  Henderson  was  a  member  of  the  City  Council  from  1868  to  1871.  He  was 
a  life  member  of  the  Protestant  House  of  Industry  and  Refuge,  and  took  a  most 
active  part  in  the  welfare  and  support  of  the  Montreal  General  Hospital  and  other 
charitable  institutions. 

He  married,  in  1835,  ^  daughter  of  the  late  Captain  Jamieson  of  the  4th  Royal 
Battalion,  and  his  sons  are  actively  employed  in  the  business.  After  a  busy  life  he 
died  not  long  ago  in  Montreal.

HON.   SENATOR   URUMMOND. 

"  The  Hon.  Geo.  A.  Driimmond.  Senator,  needs  no  introduction  to  tlie  Canadian 
public.  As  a  citizen  of  Montreal,  as  a  business  man,  as  a  patron  of  art  and  a  friend 
of  all  good  works,  he  has  earned  and  holds  to-day  an  honored  place  in  the  ranks  of 
the  leading  men  of  his  adopted  country.  Mr.  Drummond  is  a  native  of  Kdinburgh, 
Scotland,  where  he  was  born  in  the  year  1829.  In  1854,  he  came  to  Canada,  to  act 
in  the  capacity  of  Superintendent  for  the  Canada  Sugar  Refining  Company.  Gifted 
with  fine  business  ability,  as  well  as  energy  and  force  of  character,  he  rose  to  the 
position  of  President  in  the  company.  He  has  also  interested  himself  in  many  other 
important  industrial  and  commercial  enterprises.  His  standing  in  the  business  world  is 
indicated  by  the  fact  that  he  is  Vice-President  of  the  Bunk  of  Montreal,  and  was  for 
several  years  President  of  the  Montreal  Board  of  Trade,  In  whatever  concerned  the 
welfare  and  progress  of  Montreal,  the  Hon.  Mr.  Drummond  has  interested  himself 
heartily  and  to  good  jnirpose.  In  addition  to  being  the  President  of  the  Canada 
Sugar  Refining  Company  he  is  President  or  Vice-President  or  Director  in  many  other 
important  companies  engaged  in  commerce,  mining  or  manufacture.  Ajjart  from 
purely  business  concerns  he  is  an  intelligent  and  discriminating  j^atron  of  art,  and 
possesses  one  of  the  finest  collections  *of  paintings  to  be  found  in  Canada.  His 
private  residence  is  one  of  the  handsomest  in  Montreal.  Mr.  Drummond  was  called 
to  the  Senate  on  December  ist,  1888,  and  the  appointment  was  received  with  universal 
satisfaction.  His  high  reputation,  coupled  with  the  knowledge  of  his  wide  reaching 
and  successful  business  career,  inspired  confidence  that  the  talents  so  ably  exercised 
in  personal  concerns  would  be  no  less  worthily  and  ably  devoted  to  the  general 
interests  of  the  country." 

GEORGE  BROWNE 

Was  born  in  Belfast,  Ireland,  181 1.  His  fiither,  of  the  same  name,  was  an  architect 
of  that  city.  He  came  to  Quebec  in  1830,  where  he  resided  for  a  number  of  years. 
During  1837-3S  he  held  a  commission  in  the  JVlilitia,  and  then  took  an  active  i)art. 
In  1840,  he  removed  to  Montreal.  In  1841,  he  was  sent  to  Kingston  to  prepare  the 
Parliament  Buildings  there,  and  was  at  the  same  lime  the  architect  of  the  Cifv  Hall 
and  Market.  In  1844,  he  was  sent  by  the  Board  of  Works  Department  to  Montreal 
to  prepare  the  Parliament  Buildings  and  other  Government  offices ;  and  "  Monk- 
lands,"  the  residence  then  of  the  Governor  (ieneral,  the  City  Hall  and  the  City 
Concert  Hall  were  fitted  up  under  his  supervision.  In  1851-52,  he  was  employed 
by  the  Board  of  Works  Department  to  proceed  to  ( )uebec  to  plan  and  superintend 
the  alterations  in  the  Parliament  Buildings  (since  destroyed  by  fire)  and  Spencer 
Wood,  the  then  Governor  General's  residence. 

In  1854,  he  was  unanimously  elected  to  represent  the  Centre  Ward.  In  1857, 
he  was  appointed  to  the  Commission  of  the  Peace.  Special  mention  may  be  made 
of  the  Montreal  Merchants'  Exchange,  subsequently  destroyed  by  fire,  and  the 
Molson  Banking  House,  which  were  also  designed  by  Mr.  Browne.  He  died  a  few 
years  ago.

HON.  JUDGE  C.  P.  DAVIDSON 

"  Was  born  in  this  Province  in  i843,and  is  the  eldest  son  of  the  late  Captain  Alexander 
Davidson.  The  learned  judge  was  educated  at  McGill  University,  Montreal.  He 
graduated  B.A.  and  li.C.L.  in  1863,  and  received  his  M.A.  in  1867.  He  was  admitted 
to  the  I3ar  in  1864,  and  practised  in  i)artners]iip  with  Mr.  Justice  Cross  of  the  Court 
of  Appeals.  During  his  career  at  the  Bar  Mr.  Davidson  greatly  distinguished  himself 
as  an  able  and  eloquent  pleader.  For  several  years  he  acted  as  Crown  Prosecutor  in 
this  city,  and  was  in  every  respect  a  model  Crown  Counsel.  He  was  created  Queen's 
Counsel  in  1878,  in  which  year  he  published  a  work  on  "  The  Banking  Laws  of 
Canada."  He  contested  Montreal  Centre  for  the  Legislature  in  1882  and  Huntingdon 
for  the  House  of  Commons  in  1883,  but  was  unsuccessful  on  both  occasions.  His 
appointment  to  the  Superior  Court  in  June,  1887,  was  a  very  popular  one,  and  it  is 
not  too  much  to  say  that  Judge  Davidson  has  fully  justified  the  brightest  prophecies 
of  his  friends.  He  has  not  only  been  a  diligent  and  faithful  judge,  whose  decisions 
have  been  It  gaily  found  and  gracefully  expressed — for  the  learned  judge  is  a  master 
of  English — but  his  conduct  of  trials  has  invariably  been  marked  by  great  judicial 
dignity  and  suavity.  His  promptitude  in  deciding  cases  has  been  remarkable,  though 
he  has  never  sacrificed  thoroughness  to  celerity.  Since  his  appointment,  he  has 
presided  over  most  of  the  large  commercial  jury  trials  with  great  acceptance.  He 
is  in  the  full  vigor  of  life,  and  his  nomination  as  a  late  Royal  Commissioner  was 
well  received.  Judge  Davidson  was  Colonel  of  the  Victoria  Rifles,  and  for  many 
years  President  of  the  Montreal  Snowshoe  Club  and  the  Victoria  Skating  Club.  He 
is  an  enthusiastic  yachtsman,  and  spends  his  vacations  at  his  beautiful  summer  home 
at  Dorval,  on  Lake  St.  Louis." 

J.  T.  FINNIE,  M.D.,  L.R.C.S  ,  EniN., 

Was  born  at  Peterhead,  Scotland,  14th  September,  1847.  Dr.  Finnic  was  educated 
partly  in  the  Parish  School  of  his  native  place,  and,  after  coming  to  Canada,  in  the 
High  School  of  McGill  College,  Montreal,  and  latterly  in  the  University.  He  gradua-

Edinburgh,  London  and  Paris,  walking  the  hospitals  of  these  celebrated  cities,  and 
in  October  of  that  year  he  passed  the  necessary  examination  at  th.e  Royal  College  of 
Surgeons,  Edinburgh,  and  received  from  that  Institution  the  degrees  of  Surgery 
and  Midwifery.  He  returned  to  Montreal  in  1879,  and  for  the  first  quarter  of  a 
century  has  successfully  practised  his  profession.  Dr.  Finnic  is  well  known  amongst 
various  Societies,  national  and  other  kinds,  and  on  two  occasions  has  been  elected 
President  of  the  Montreal  Caledonian  Society.  He  has  also  been  President  of  the 
Montreal  Swimming  Club.  He  is  too  busy  to  attend  to  Municipal  or  Provincial  politics, 
though  more  than  once  offered  positions  both  in  the  Cily  Council  and  Legislature. 
If  time  permitted  he  would  make  a  valuable  addition  to  any  party  to  which  he  would 
ally  himself.  He  married  9th  April,  1874,  Amelia,  daughter  of  the  late  Chas.  Healy,. 
of  Montreal,  and  has  fjur  children.

JOHN  G.  DINNING 

Was  born  July  loth,  1807,  in  Glasgow,  Scotland.    He  was  educated  in  the  principal 
commercial  school   of  that   city.     He  was    there  a   clerk    in  the  firm   of  Pxlward 
Walkinshaw  &amp;  Co.,  engaged  in  the  Australian  trade,  and  by  them  was  sent  to  Liver- 
pool in  1 83 1.  A  friend  of  his  family,  a  Mr.  Middleton,  offered  him  a  position  in  a  house 
in  Gibraltar,  and  after  some  time  in  tliat  interesting  fortress  town,  he  was  transferred 
to  Cadiz,  Spain,  where  he  remained  until  the  Spaniards  closed  the  port.     He  then 
came  to  Canada  to  push  a  claim  of  Mr.  Middleton  against  a  Montreal  firm  of  that 
day.     After  forty-two  days  of  tempestuous  struggle  against  wind  and  sea,  the  vessel 
reached  New  York  in  the  spring  of  1835.     He  came  on  to  Montreal  and  met  with  a 
cordial  reception  from  Messrs.  H.  &amp;  A.  Allan.    In  1836,  the  ice  on  tlie  St.  Lawrence, 
which  had  done  great  damages  by   "  shoves  "  and   floods,  drove  in   the  walls  of 
Handyside's  distillery  on  Commissioners  street.     'I'he  ice  piled  thirty  feet  high.     At 
a  point  on  Common  street,  not  far  from  what  is  now  McGill  street,  the  ice  crushed 
a  house  in  wliicii  a  man  named  White,  wife  and   three  children  were  killed  while 
sitting  at  dinner.     Mr.  Dinning  then  commenced  writing  upon  tl.e  flood  question. 
The  floods  of  1838,  1840  and  1841  followed,  and  a  public  meeting  was  held  and  a 
Royal  Commission  of  the  Royal  F.ngineers  was  appointed.     Nothing  came  out  of  it 
but  a  re])ort,  and  Mr.  Dinning  employed,  at  his  own  expense,  the  late  George  Wait 
to  make  surveys.    In  1836,  Mr.  Dinning  entered  into  a  partnership  with  Mr.  Senior, 
a  Liverpool  commissi  &gt;n   merchant,  under  the  name  of  Dinning  &amp;  Senior,  and  an 
extensive  and  lucrative  trade  was  built  up  between  Montreal  and  Liverpool,  Glasgow, 
Hamburg  and  Dundee.  Then  came  the  Rebellion,  and  exchange  on  London  reached 
thirly-eight  per  cent  premium.     Several  heavy  losses  resulted  in  a  closing  up  of  the 
partnership.     Mr.  Dinning  served  in  the   Royal  Montreal  Cavahy,  under  Captain 
Sweeney,  and  was  mentioned  iionorably  for  his  services.  Mr.  Dinning's  next  venture 
was  the  purchase  of  the  Courier  about  1856.     With  Mr.  Turner  as  editor,  he  pub- 
lished the  journal  until  1862,  when  he  sold  it  to  the  late  Edmund  H.  Parsons,  who 
changed  the  name  of  the  paper  to  the  Evening  Tcleg^raph.,  and  made  it  a  two-cent 
daily,  which  continued  to  be  in  Montreal  the  rampant  organ  of  the  Southern  States, 
then  fighting  for  states' rights.     The  Witness  inaugura.ed  the  one-cent  newspaper 
system,  and  the  Telegraph  died  a  natural  death.   Mr.  Dinning,  in  1851,  was  appointed 
Secretary  of  the  Board  of  'i'rade,   and  filled   the   duties   of  Secretary  of  the  Corn 
Exchange  and  of  Secretary  of  the  Merchants'  P^xchange.     He  resigned  the  position 
after  nine  years  of  service.     Mr.  Dinning  held  the  position  of  Secretary  of  the  Mer- 
chants' Exchange  Reading  Room  for  twenty-eight  years.     He  was  constantly  at  his 
post  until  stricken  down  with   palsy.     In   1882,  Mr.  Dinning  removed  to  Lachine, 
where  he  resides   with    his  family  of  two  daughters  and  one  son.     In   1842,   Mr. 
Dinning  himself  paid  for  the  first  water  cart  on  St.  Antoine  street,  and  paid  for  the 
first  posts  and  chains  on  Victoria  Square  in  order  to  protect  the  public  from  accidents. 
Mr.  Dinning's  public  spirit  is   recorded  in  the  improvements  now  seen  and  so  often 
advocated  by  him.

DAVID  ROSS  AND  DR.  GEORGE  ROSS. 

The  grandfather,  David  Ross,  was  a  Banker  of  Tain,  Scotland.  The  father, 
John  Ross,  was  in  the  78th  Fraser  Higlilanders  under  Wolfe  at  the  taking  of 
Quebec,  1759.  His  brother  John  was  Frothonotary  for  years  of  the  District  of  Quebec, 
and  his  son,  the  Hon.  David  A.  Ross,  has  long  been  connected  in  the  Government  of 
the  Province  and  Quebec  Institutions. 

One  of  the  very  few  representatives  now  in  Montreal  of  this  family  is  the 
well-known  Physician  and  Professor,  Dr.  George  Ross  of  McGill  University.  He 
was  the  son  of  David  Ross'  eldest  son,  Arthur.  Mr.  D.  Ross  was  a  prominent  member 
of  the  Montreal  Bar,  and  Attorney-General  in  1820.  The  writer  many  years  ago  had 
the  aid  and  Christian  help  of  Mr.  Arthur  Ross,  in  visiting  and  helping  him  in  his 
ministrations  and  work  as  Chaplain  to  the  Gaols,  and  he  looks  back  with  pleasure  to 
the  days  when  Dr.  Ross  and  many  others  of  his  present  contemporaries  were  pupils 
under  his  tuition  in  the  High  School  of  McGill  College,  and  remembers  the  pleasure 
experienced  when  Dr.  Ross  as  a  student  became  the  Gold  Medallist  of  the  University 
of  McGill.  His  career  as  a  medical  man  is  well  known  in  Montreal,  He  has  been 
connected  with  his  Alma  Mater  for  years  as  one  of  her  Professors  of  Medicine,  and 
he  is  Vice-Dean  of  the  Faculty  of  that  Department. 


HON.  JUSTICE  SMITH. 

James  S^^ITH  was  a  Canadian  by  birth,  though  a  Scotchman  by  origin.  He  was  born 
in  tiie  City  of  Montreal,  and  received  his  education  in  Scotland  ;  although  previously 
he  had  been  placed  with  a  gentleman  (Rev.  Mr.  Doty)  at  Three  Rivers.  He  re- 
mained in  Scotland  for  seven  years,  and  returned  to  Montreal  in  1823  ;  and  was 
immediately  articled  as  a  law  student,  first  with  Mr.  B.  Beaubien,  with  whom  he 
remained  four  years ;  and  secondly,  with  Mr.  (afterwards  the  Honorable  Justice) 
Gale,  with  whom  he  completed  his  lime.  Mr.  Smith  was  called  to  the  Bar  of  Lower 
Canada  in  1830.  He  at  once  entered  into  partnership  with  an  old  and  experienced 
practitioner  and  a  King's  Counsel,  the  late  D.  Fisher,  Esq. 

In  November,  1844,  he  was  elected  for  the  County  of  Missisquoi,  in  the 
Eastern  Townships,  after  having  on  the  ist  September  previously  gone  into  office  in 
the  Viger-Draper  Administration,  as  Attorney  General,  East.  Party  feeling  ran 
exceedingly  high,  and  many  offices  in  the  Administration  were  unfilled,  consequently 
the  others  were  the  more  arduous  and  onerous  to  hold,  especially  when  the  Ministry 
had  only  a  very  small  majority  (about  five  or  six)  in  the  House.  Nevertheless  they 
held  together;  and  Mr.  Smith  continued  to  hold  office  until  the  22nd  April,  1847, 
when  he  resigned,  and  was  appointed  a  Judge  of  the  Court  of  Queen's  Bench  of 
Lower  Canada.  Judge  Smith  will  be  best  remembered  in  connection  with  the  St* 
Albans  Raiders.     He  died  some  years  ago.

JOHN  SLEEP  HONEY. 

He  was  born  in  Callington  (Borough),  County  of  Cornwtall.  His  father  was  a 
master-builder.  At  the  age  of  thirteen  John  S.  Honey  entered  the  office  of  a  dis- 
tinguished lawyer,  in  his  native  Borough,  as  clerk,  and  continued  in  this  employ- 
ment for  four  years.  In  the  month  of  July,  1832,  the  family  emigrated  to  Canada. 
Mr.  John  S.  Honey  was  favored  witii  a  kind  letter  of  introduction  from  Sir  William 
Pratts  Call,  Baronet,  to  Lord  Aylmer,  then  Governor  of  Lower  Canada.  The  ftimily 
were  promptly  conveyed  from  Quebec  to  Montreal  by  the  Steamer  ''  John  Bull."  In 
December  following  his  arrival  Mr.  Honey  had  the  good  fortune  to  be  engaged  by 
the  Joint  Prothonotarics  of  the  then  Court  of  King's  Bench,  Messrs.  Monk  &amp; 
Morrogh.  He  was  drst  employed  as  Enquete  Clerk,  and  at  the  end  of  the  engage- 
ment, which  lasted  about  a  week,  he  became  Clerk  in  the  Inferior  term  of  tlie  Court 
of  King's  Bench,  whence,  after  some  two  weeks'  service,  \\^  v.'as  promoted  to  the 
permanent  staff  of  the  Court  of  King's  Bench.  In  six  months  after  his  promotion 
he  was  articled  for  five  years  as  a  law  student  in  the  office  of  the  Prothonotarics, 
who  were  both  lawyers,  and  at  the  end  of  this  term  was  duly  admitted  to  the  Bar, 
but  as  his  services  in  the  Department  were  considered  valuable  by  the  Prothonotarics, 
and  his  salary  having  been  handsomely  augmented,  he  declined  to  enter  upon  the 
practice  of  the  profession.  In  the  course  of  four  years  Mr.  Honey's  administrative 
capacity  effected  many  important  changes  in  the  office,  which  continue  in  operation 
to  the  present  period. 

In  1850,  the  fees  of  the  Court  in  Lower  Canada  were  ordered  by  law  to  be 
funded.  About  the  same  period  took  place,  under  another  enactment,  further  decen- 
tralization of  the  administration  of  justice,  which,  by  establishing  several  Courts  in 
new  localities,  so  reduced  the  fees  in  all  the  old  Districts  that  the  Government  was 
obliged  to  pay  from  the  general  revenue  a  large  amount  annually  to  meet  deficien- 
cies. 

In  order  to  remedy  this  defect  in  the  working  of  these  several  Courts,  Mr. 
Honey  submitted  to  the  Government,  in  the  year  i860,  a  readjustment  of  the 
Montreal  Tariff  of  Fees  of  tlie  Superior  Court,  which  was  adopted  in  March,  1861, 
and  extended  uniformly  to  all  the  Districts.  As  a  result  of  this  change,  instead  of  a 
deficiency  there  has  been  always  an  annual  surplus. 

In  the  year  1862,  Mr.  Honey  rendered  important  services  to  the  legal  profession 
by  the  publication  of  a  Table  of  Fees  and  Disbursements  payable  to  .Attorneys  and 
Officers  of  the  Courts  in  suits  at  law  ;  also.  Rules  of  Practice  of  the  Court  of  Queen's 
Bench  ;  and  Tariffs  of  Fees  for  Registrars,  Advocates  and  Officers  of  the  Courts, 
including  schedules  of  taxes  upon  Proceedings  in  Courts  of  Civil  and  Criminal 
Jurisdiction  in  Lower  Canada. 

In  the  year  1844,  upon  the  death  of  Mr.  Morrogh,  Mr.  Honey  was  appointed 
Deputy  Prothonotary  of  the  Superior  and  Circuit  Courts,  and  so  continued  till  the 
year  1865,  when  upon  the  demise  of  Mr.  Monk  he  received  the  appointment  of  Joint

Protlionotary  with  Messrs.  Coffin  &amp;  Papineau.  In  the  following  year  Mr.  Coffin 
died,  and  was  succeeded  by  Mr,  Hubert,  the  firm  then  becoming  Hubert,  Papineau 
&amp;  Honey.  Mr.  Papineau  retired,  Mr.  Hubert  died,  and  Mr.  Honey  continued  sole 
Prothonotary  to  his  death. 

SIR  JOHN  COPE  SHERBROOKE,  G.C.B. 

"  General  Sherbrooke,  who  succeeded  General  Sir  Gordon  Drummond  in  the 
govsrnment  of  Canada,  in  1816,  was  a  military  commander  of  some  repute,  and  had 
seen  some  service.  He  was  the  youngest  broliier  of  VV.  Sherbrooke,  Esq.,  of  Oxton, 
and  of  Colonel  Cope,  of  Sherwood  Lodge,  Notts.  He  distinguished  himself  in  the 
taking  of  Seringapatam,  in  the  East  Indies,  in  1797.  He  afterwards  served  on  the 
Peninsula  in  the  early  campaign  of  the  Duke  of  Wellington.  Previously  to  his  con- 
nection with  Canada  he  administered  the  Government  of  Nova  Scotia,  as  history 
tells  us,  "  with  much  tact  and  dexterity." 

He  assumed  the  reins  of  government  at  a  most  critical  period  of  the  country, 
— namely,  that  in  which  the  farmers  of  Lower  Canada  suffered  the  total  loss  of  their 
wheat  crop.  The  wise  and  prudent  course  adopted  by  Sir  John  in  this  instance 
secured  for  him  the  love  and  esteem  of  all.  He  look  the  responsibility  of  advancing 
to  the  relief  of  the  farmers  the  sum  of  _;^i4,2i6  to  secure  them  from  destitution,  and 
to  assist  them  in  laying  down  another  crop.  On  the  meeting  of  Parliament,  it  not 
only  released  him  from  the  responsibility  which  he  had  taken  on  himself,  but  voted  an 
additional  sum  of  ;^35,Soo  for  the  same  purpose,  and  to  loan  to  industrious  and 
deserving  farmers. 

He  took  a  bold  and  determined  stand  in  the  matter  of  Judges  Sewell  and  Monk  ; 
and,  when  advised  by  the  Home  Government  to  support  those  gentlemen,  plainly 
advised  that  it  would  be  hopeless,  and  strongly  advised  the  impeachment  to  be  tried 
before  the  Privy  Council.  To  his  resolute,  manly  and  open  conduct  in  this  instance 
must  be  ascribed  the  result. 

During  his  administration,  he  also  effected  the  entrance  of  the  Si)eaker  of  the 
Assembly  ex-officio  to  a  seat  in  the  Executive  Council ;  and  the  concurrence  of  the 
Imperial  Government  was  announced,  that  it  accepted  the  Canadian  Government's 
offer  to  defray  the  expenses  of  the  Civil  List. 

Sir  John  governed  the  Province  from  1816  to  1818;  and  on  account  of  ill-health&gt; 
but  principally  from  dislike  of  the  station,  he  requested  his  recall.  Accordingly  he 
left  the  country  on  the  12th  of  August,  carrying  with  him  the  best  wishes  and  regards 
of  the  majority  of  the  people  of  Lower  Canada.  Prior  to  his  departure  numerous 
addresses  were  presented  to  him  from  different  sections  of  the  country,  all  breathing 
alike  the  warmest  sentiments  of  goodwill  and  prayers  for  his  future  welfare. 

He  returned  home,  but  did  not  leave  the  military  service,  as,  in  May,  1825, 
he  was  raised  to  the  high  rank  of  General.  His  death  occurred  on  the  14th 
February,  1830,  at  Claverton,  Nottinghamshire."

ROBERT  UNVVIN  HARWOOD 

"  EusTACHK  G.  M.  DE  LoTBiNiERE  was  the  last  male  representative  of  the  ancient 
house  of  Lotbini6re,  having  inherited  fro.n  his  father  the  Seigniories  of  Vautlreiiil, 
Rigaud  and  Lotbini^re,  with  the  title  of  Marquis.  In  1793,  he  was  made  Speaker  of 
the  House  of  Assembly,  succeeding  Mr.  Panet.  To  him  is  justly  due  that  all  political, 
civil,  military  or  criminal  affiiirs  arc  transacted  in  either  or  both  the  English  and 
French  languages.  At  the  close  of  his  great  speech  on  this  question,  he  thus  said  : 
*'  Nous  deniandons  que  I'une  et  I'autre  soient  permises ;  que  nos  proc^s-verbaux 
soient  ecriis  dans  les  deux  langues." 

He  died  in  1821  at  Vaudreuil,  and  was  buried  in  the  Parish  Church  there.  He 
had  been  twice  married — first  to  Mile,  de  Tonnancour,  who  died  leaving  no  children. 
Afterwards  he  married  Mile.  Munro,  who  bore  him  three  daughters.  The  Marchioness 
died  in  1834,  and  was  buried  beside  her  husband.  The  Lotbini^re  family  is  now  repre- 
sented alone  by  his  three  daughters.  Marie  L.  J.  de  Lotbiniere  married,  in  1823,  Robert 
Unwin  Harwood,  an  English  merchant  and  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Council. 
The  Harwood  family  was  one  of  the  first  families  in  Sheflield,  England.  In  1822,  he 
came  to  Canada  to  found  a  branch  of  the  Sheffield  business,  and  fixed  on  Montreal 
as  the  locality.  After  his  marriage,  having  plenty  of  money  and  the  beautiful  Seigniory 
of  Vaudreuil,  which  his  wife  had  brought  him  as  her  dowry,  he  retired  from  business 
and  resided  at  the  Manor  House  of  Vaudreuil,  giving  up  all  his  spare  time  to  agri- 
culture. He  was  named  Legislative  Councillor  in  1832,  and  in  1838  a  member  of 
the  Special  Council.  After  having  represented  the  County  of  Vaudreuil  and  Clark 
from  1858  to  i860,  he  was  elected  to  represent  the  Division  of  Rigaud,  which  he  held 
to  his  death  in  1863.  He  had  ten  children.  Antoine  C.  de  L.  Harwood,  the  eldest, 
was  born  in  Montreal,  23rd  April,  1825.  After  finishing  his  studies  in  the  College  of 
Montreal,  and  being  called  to  the  Bar  in  1848,  he  became  Member  of  the  Provincial 
Parliament  for  the  County  of  Vaudreuil  for  seven  years,  from  1863  to  1870.  He 
married  on  February  4th,  1851,  Mile.  Margaret  Angelique  Lefebvre  de  Bellefeuille, 
the  daui^htcr  of  the  Colonel  of  that  name.  His  military  career  dates  from  January, 
1869.  Since  then  he  was  one  of  the  most  esteemed  officers  of  the  Militia,  and 
an  ornament  and  example  to  the  service.  The  most  notable  speech  whicii  the  gallant 
Colonel  ever  made  was  at  the  dedication  and  unveiling  of  the  monument  to  DeSala- 
berry,  at  Chambly.  All  were  charmed  by  the  dignity,  brilliancy  and  fluency  which 
he  then  displayed.  He  had  a  magnificent  voice,  and  thus  often  delighted  those  who 
had  the  pleasure  of  meeting  him  in  social  circles.  He  died  in  Montreal  6th  August, 
1891. 

The  other  sons  are  Robert  Unwin  Harwood,  second  son,  who  was  Prefet  du 
Comte  de  Vaudreuil  and  highly  esteemed.  He  was  born  in  Montreal,  27ih  October, 
1826,  and  educated  at  St.  Sulpice  College  ;  has  been  a  Member  of  Parliament.  Wm. 
Bingham  Harwood,  merchant,  of  Montreal.  Alain  C.  Harwood,  who  resides  at 
Vaudreuil.  Henri  Stans.  Harwood,  Civil  Engineer  and  Provincial  Surveyor,  who 
resides  also  at  Vaudreuil,  and  Chas.  L.  Harwood.

Of  the  four  daughters,  three  were  married,  The  first,  Marie  Louise,  married 
de  Uellefeuille  McDonald,  of  Montreal.  Marie  Antoinette  married  Mr.  'I'ascliercau, 
Advocate,  of  (Quebec,  and  who  is  now  Judge  of  tiie  Superior  ("ourt.  Mane  I  lenriette 
married  Lieutenant-Colonel  I'anet,  Advocate. 

Another  daughter,  the  second  of  tlie  House  of  Lotbini^re,  married  in  iSji,  as 
Seignioress  of  Rigaud,  Mr.  VVui.  JSingham,  a  millionaire  of  Pliiladelphia,  U.S.A. 
He  was  the  son  of  an  American  Senator.  His  daughter  was  married  to  the 
celebrated  Lord  Aslibuilon,  whom  we  Clanadians  have  to  thank  that  we  were  deprived 
of  the  territory  of  the  St.ile  of  Maine  in  the  Ashburlon  Treaty  between  Canada  and 
the  United  Slates  in  settling  the  JJoundary  Line,  when  he  foolislily  gave  over  that 
large  tract  of  pinewood  territory  to  the  United  States,  and  thus  enabled  them,  as 
they  do,  to  run  within  a  few  miles  of  Quebec. 

IJy  the  marriage  of  this  second  daughter  to  Wm.  Bingham's  son  there  were  born 
five  children,  two  sons  and  ihree  daughters.  One  of  the  daughters  marrieil  Coiuu 
Olivier  r&gt;rian  de  Bois-(.luilbert,  a  descendant  of  the  famous  Templar,  who  is  spoken 
of  in  the  beautiful  tale  of  "  Ivanhoe,"  by  Sir  Walter  Scott,  All  the  famil&gt;  reside  in 
France. 

The  third  daughter,  Mile.  Julia  de  Lolbiniere,  married  in  1830  M.  Guslave 
Joly,  and  gave  iiim  the  Seigniory  (jf  Lotbiniere  as  dowry.  They  had  tiiree  children. 
The  Honorable  and  well-known  Cruslave  Joly  is  their  son,  whose  career  needs  no 
pen  of  mine  to  describe,  as  his  past  deeds  show  him  to  be  "  lui  chevalier  sans  peur 
et  sans  reproche."  Amelie  married  Mr.  Savage,  an  English  officer.  I'.dmund  was 
also  in  the  English  army,  and  was  slain  at  the  siege  of  Lucknow,  in  the  Lulian 
revolt. 

The  two  portraits  in  this  sketch  are  those  of  Colonel  Harwood,  whose  death 
is  above  recorded,  and  Henri  Stans.  Harwood,  NLP.P.  for  Vaudreuil.  His  sou  is  a 
Doctor  in  Montreal.  He  studied  at  Bourgct  College,  Rigaud,  and  was  admitted  to 
practice  as  a  physician  and  surgeon  in  1890.  He  mr.rried  Miss  ^L^rie  ^Llssoll,  niece 
of  the  ex-IJeutenant-Governor  of  Quebec,  and  is  now  in  the  present  Cabinet  ot  the

HON.    JOSEPH    MASSON. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  in  St.  Faistache,  1791.  After  receiving  his 
education  there  and  remaining  for  a  short  time  in  St.  Eustache,  Mr.  Masson  came  to 
Montreal,  and  in  1814  entered  into  partnership  with  W.  &amp;  H.  Robertson,  of  Glas- 
gow, Scotland,  under  the  title  of  Robertson,  Masson  &amp;  Co.  in  Montreal,  and  W.  &amp; 
H.  Robertson  in  Glasgow. 

This  partnership  continuedamtil  1820,  and  on  the  death  of  Mr.  W.  Robertson 
Mr.  Masson  entered  into  partnership    with    F.  A,  Larocque  and   Struther  Strang.

They  opened  a  new  house  in  Quebec  under  the  name  of  Masson,  Larocquc,  Strang 
&amp;  Co.,  which  continued  until  1832,  when  the  two  latter  gentlemen  retired  from  the 
firm,  when  it  was  continued  by  H.  Robertson,  the  Honorable  Joseph  Masson,  John 
Strang  and  Charles  Langevin.  Tliis  firm  continued  to  1846,  when  the  firm  in  Mon-

in  Glasgow,  Masson,  Sons  &amp;  Co.,  which  continued  till  the  death  of  the  founder  of 
the  firm,  Honorable  Joseph  Masson,  in  1847.  After  his  death  Wilfred  A.  R.  Masson

will  be  ever  remembered  by  her  munificent  and  generous  gift  to  the  education  of  the 
country,  in  the  building  and  endowing  Masson  College,  Terrebonne,  one  of  the 
finest  educational  establishments  in  Lower  Canada. 

The  honorable  gentleman   died  on  the  15th   May,  1847,  '^"&lt;^''  ^^^^^  buried   in  the 
Church  of  Terrebonne. 

HON.  LOUIS  FRAN(;OIS  RODRIQUE  MASSON 

Was  born  at  Terrebonne  in  1833,  and  was  educated  at  the  Jesuit  College,  George- 
town, and  at  Worcester,  U.S.,  and  completed  his  classical  studies  at  St.  Hyacinthe. 
He  studied  Law,  and  was  called  to  the  ]&gt;ar  of  Lower  Canada  in  1859.  He  first  entered 
public  life  in  1867,  representing  his  native  county  m  the  Commons  of  Canada  from 
that  time  up  to  1882,  when  he  was  called  to  the  Senate.  He  wns  sworn  of  the  Privy 
Council  as  Minister  of  Militia  and  Defence  in  1878,  but  resigned  in  1880  and  ac- 
cepted the  portfolio  of  President  of  the  Council,  which  office  he  was  forced  to  give 
up  through  severe  ill  health  to  the  regret  of  the  whole  country.  His  record  as  Minister 
of  Militia  stands  much  to  his  credit  as  a  soldier  and  administrator.  He  knew  the 
wants  of  the  service,  having  served  himself  as  a  volunleer  since  1862.  In  the  Militia 
he  has  held  the  ])ositions  of  Brigade  Major,  8th  Military  District,  from  1863  to  1868, 
and  served  on  the  frontier  during  the  first  Fenian  raid,  Nfarch,  1866,  and  was  also  on 
active  service  during  the  second  raid  the  same  year.  He  was  promoted  Lieutenant- 
Colonel,  1867.  On  the  resignation  of  the  late  Hon.  Mr.  Mousseau,  Premier  of 
Quebec,  he  was  called  upon  to  form  an  administration,  but  was  compelled  to  decline 
owing  to  his  continued  ill-health.  He  was  next  a])poiiUed  Lieutenant-Governor  of 
Quebec  in  1884,  and  held  this  office  up  to  1887,  when  his  health  agam  fi)rced  him 
to  resign.  After  his  temporary  retirement  from  political  life  he  studied  Literature  and 
published  an  ''  Historical  Sketch  of  the  Old  North-West  Company,"  which  comprised 
many  unpublished  records,  letters,  etc.,  relating  to  the  early  history  of  the  North- 
West  Territories.  He  was  reappointed  to  the  Senate  in  1890.  He  has  been  twice 
married  :  first,  in  1856,  to  Louisa  Rachel,  eldest  daughter  of  the  late  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Alexander  Mackenzie,  who  died  in  1880  ;  and  second,  in  1883,  to  Cecile,  daughter  of 
John  H.  Burroughs,  of  Quebec.  He  has  been  Mayor  of  Terrebonne,  and  has  always 
been  a  staunch  Conservative.  He  has  again  entered  political  life,  having  been 
appointed  one  of  the  present  Cabinet  at  Quebec  without  portfolio.

"WOLFRED  NELSON,  M.U. 

This  well-known  gentleman  was  born  in  Montreal  on  the  loth  July,  1792.  His  father 
was  William  Nelson,  son  of  a  victualling  officer  in  the  Royal  Navy,  as  the  Com- 
missariat of  that  department  was  then  termed,  His  mother  was  a  daughter  of 
Mr.  G.  Dies,  of  Hudson  River,  State  of  New  York.  Being  an  enthusiastic  loyalist, 
he  lost  all  he  possessed,  and  took  refuge  in  Canada,  where  he  terminated  a  long  and 
respected  life. 

At  the  early  age  of  less  than  fourteen  years  Wolfred  Nelson  was  apprenticed  to 
Dr.  Carter,  of  the  army  medical  staff,  at  Sorel,  December,  1805.  There  being  few 
medical  men  in  Canada  at  that  period,  he  was  soon  forced  into  practice,  and  had  the 
drudgery  of  a  small  military  hospital  confided  to  him.  In  January,  1811,  he  was 
duly  licensed,  and  established  himself  at  St.  Denis,  on  the  Richelieu  river,  and  soon 
enjoyed  a  flourishing  practice. 

When  the  war  was  declared  in  1812,  he  volunteered  his  services,  requeslinj  at 
the  same  lime  to  be  the  right  hand  man  of  his  regiment  of  miliiia  ;  lie  was,  however, 
forced  to  take  the  Surgeoncy,   as  medical  men  were  "  few  and  far  between." 

In  1827  he  was  solicited  to  contest  the  rei)resentation  of  the  "Royal  Borough 
of  William  Henry,"  against  Mr.  James  Stuart,  the  Attorney-General ;  and  although 
great  mflucncc  was  used  against  him,  he  was  elected  by  a  majority  of  two,  after 
seven  days  of  ihe  hardest  election  contest  ever  cxijeiierced  in  Canada.  The  Attor- 
ney-Cieneral  instituted  actions  of  so  harassing  a  nature,  that  the  House  of  Assembly 
was  petitioned  ;  this  resulted  in  Mr.  Stuart's  suspension  from  office.  But  he  assumed 
such  a  fierce  and  determined  attitude  towards  the  then  (jovernor,  Lord  Aylmer,  that 
it  led  to  his  being  deprived  of  his  high  office. 

The  part  that  the  Doctor  took  in  the  troubles  of  '37  are  sufficiently  well  known 
not  to  be  here  reproduced,  suffice  it  to  say  that  two  thousand  dollars  had  been 
offered  ior  his  arrest.  He  was  conveyed  to  Montreal,  and  confined  for  seven  months  in 
the  gaol.  At  the  end  of  that  time,  having  jjreviously  received  his  sentence,  which  was 
banishment  for  life,  he  was,  with  other  jjersons  connected  with  the  rebellion,  taken 
to  Quebec,  and  placed  on  board  one  of  Her  Majesty's  vessels,  in  order  to  be  taken 
to  the  West  Indies.  When  in  the  A\'est  Indies,  the  exiles  received  the  proceedings 
which  had  taken  place  in  the  House  of  Lords  declaring  their  trans])ortalion  illegal  ; 
they  were  allowed  to  dei)art,  and  reached  the  United  States,  1st  November,  1838- 
In  the  United  States  the  Doctor  remained  until  August,  1842,  when  he  returned  to 
his  native  city,  with  a  wife  and  large  family,  to  begin  the  world  anew,  having  lost  all 
his  fine  property  by  fire.  He  had  deei)ly  atoned  for  the  past  ;  and,  by  his  services 
in  preserving  human  life  during  the  time  when  fever  and  cholera  were  raging,  and 
when  grim  denth  was  stalking  and  carrying  oft  numberless  victims,  he  endeared  him- 
self to  a  great  many,  and  became  entitled  to  the  grateful  remembrance  of  the  pecple 
of  the  country.  In  1845,  ^^r.  Nelson  was  triumi)hantly  elected  for  the  County  of 
Richelieu,  in  opposition  to  the  great  Hon.  D.  15.  V'iger.  He  represented  that  county 
for  two  parliaments,  and  was  a  member  of  the  House  when  the  celebrated  Rebellion

Losses  Bill  was  discussed  and  passed.  When  the  hard  names  of  traitor  and  rebel 
were  hurled  against  him,  the  old  man  rose  in  his  place,  and  in  a  determined  manner, 
claimed  to  be  heard  :  ''  Those  who  call  me  and  my  friends  rebels,"  said  he,  ''  I  tell 
them  they  lie  in  their  throats  ;  and  here  and  everywhere  else,  I  hold  myself  respon- 
sible for  the  assertion.  But,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  love  my  country  quite  as  much  as 
myself,  if  to  be  ardently  attached  to  the  British  Crown  and  our  glorious  Sovereign,  is 
to  be  guilty  of  high-treason,  then  1  am  a  rebel  indeed.  But  I  tell  those  gentlemen  to 
their  teeth,  that  it  is  they,  and  such  as  they,  who  cause  revolutions,  who  pull  down 
thrones,  trample  crowns  into  the  dust,  and  annihilate  dynasties.  It  is  their  vile  acts 
that  madden  people,  and  drive  them  to  desperation.  As  for  my  own  great  losses, 
wantonly  inflicted  as  they  were,  I  cheerfully  make  no  claim  for  them  ;  but  I  call  on 
you  to  pay  those  whose  property  you  destroyed  in  my  hands ;  and  1  am  happy,  for  I 
feel  that  with  the  protection  of  an  Almighty  Providence,  I  may  yet  honorably,  by  my 
own  exertions,  acquit  my  dues,  advanced  as  I  am  in  years.  But  there  are  hundreds 
of  others  with  less  encouraging  prospects  before  them,  whose  only  crime  was,  repos- 
ing confidence  in  the  man  they  loved  and  trusted;  pay  these  unhappy  men,  I  ask 
no  more." 

Doctor  Nelson  refused  re-election,  and  devoted  himself  with  his  wonted  energy 
to  his  profession,  in  the  line  of  which  the  inspection  of  prisons  clearly  ran.  ]ie  was 
made  Inspector  of  Prisons  in  1851,  and  so  continued  until  December,  1859,  when 
he  was  appointed  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Prison  Ins])ectors  for  the  two  Provinces, 
He  was  also  a  Justice  of  the  Peace  and  Co  umissioner  for  the  trial  of  smallcauses — 
offices  which  he  threw  up  in  1837.  He  was  repeatedly  elected  Vice-President  and  Pres- 
ident of  the  Medical  Board  and  College  of  Surgeons.  He  was  appointed  Chairman 
of  a  Board  of  Commissioners  during  the  prevalence  of  the  emigrant  fever  in  1847,  on 
which  occasion  he  rendered  great  service  in  preventing  the  spreading  of  that  dreadful 
disease  ;  as  also  Chairman  of  the  lioard  of  Health  during  the  time  tiiat  the  cholera 
raged  in  the  country.  He  was  also  tvvice  elected  Mayor  of  the  City  of  Montreal. 
His  reports  on  prisons,  etc.,  are  well  written,  and  contain  much  valuable  informa- 
tion, He  died  full  of  years  and  honors,  and  the  name  of  Dr.  VVolfred  Nelson  will 
ever,  like  that  of  Papineau,  be  held  in  veneration  by  those  who  now  enjoy  that  liberty 
and  freedom  for  which  they  fought  in  1837  '^^^^^  i&lt;^38- 

JOHN  SMITH 
Was  a  native  of  .\thelstanford,  Haddingtonshire,  Scotland.  He  came  to  Canada 
when  quite  a  youth.  He  became  a  succcsst'ul  dry  goods  merchant,  and  retired  from 
active  business  in  1844,  and  built  a  fine  house  for  himself  in  Alexander  street,  then 
one  of  the  fashionable  streets  of  Montreal.  He  was  one  of  the  original  members  of 
St.  Andrew's  Society.  He  was  one  of  the  nine  commissioners  for  the  management 
of  the  Clergy  Reserves,  and  died  on  2nd  March,  1872.  His  wife  survived  him  six 
years,  dying  i8th  May,  1878.  One  daughter  afterwards  became  Lady  Allan,  being 
the  wife  of  Sir  Hugh,  of  Kavenscrag;  another  the  wife  of  his  brother,  Andrew;  a

ALEXANDER  SCLATER. 

For  many  years  one  of  the  most  prominent  figures  in  Montreal,  and  especially 
wherever  that  portion  of  the  business  community  interested  in  shijjping  "most  do 
congregate,"  was  the  imposing  form  of  Alexander  Sclaler,  the  late  Port  Warden. 

Jiorn  at  Saltcoats,  Ayieshire,  Scotland,  on  the  13th  March,  1819,  he  followed  a  sea- 
faring life,  and  when  grown  to  manhood  commanded  a  merchantman,  visiting  during 
this  time  every  portion  of  the  globe. 

He  happened  to  be  in  Africa  with  his  vessel  when  the  Kaffir  war  broke  out, 
narrowly  escaping  being  murdered  by  the  natives.  He  carried  to  his  grave  the 
mark  of  an  assegai  which  was  thrown  at  Inm  by  one  of  the  Kaffirs  who  attacked  him, 
which  he  grasped,  lecciving  a  severe  wound  in  tiie  palm,  but  saving  his  own  life  by 
his  quickness  and  presence  of  mind. 

In  the  course  of  his  career  he  saved  from  drowning  several  people,  and  for  his 
various  noble  and  humane  acts  of  heroism  was  presented  by  the  Royal  Humane 
Society  of  London  Mith  a  gold  watch  and  several  gold  medals  suitably  inscribed. 
He  came  to  Montreal  to  settle  in  1S58,  and  was  appointed  Port  Warden  in  1863, 
holding  the  office  till  his  sudden  death  on  May  4,  1876. 

He  was  accorded  a  public  funeral,  the  various  i)laces  of  business  being  closed, 
the  flags  being  at  half  mast  on  all  the  ship])ing  and  the  ])ublic  buildings.  Work  was 
susj'ended,  and  all  the  public  bodies  in  the  city,  including  all  the  laborers  in  the 
Harbor,  attended  to  show  their  respect  for  his  many  sterling  qualities. 

Captain  Sclaler  married  a  daughter  of  the  late  Dr.  James  Grant,  of  ,\!artintown. 
County  of  Glengarry,  Upper  Canadn,  a  sister  of  Sir  James  Grant,  M.I).,  of  Ottawa, 
by  whom  he  had  ten  children,  seven  daughters  and  three  sons,  nine  of  whom  survived 
him.  \\'illiam  and  James,  of  the  firm  of  Wm.  Sclater  (S:  Co.,  are  in  business  in  this 
city  as  asbestos  miners  and  manufacturers,  and  are  widely  and  favorably  known, 
their  business  having  been  established  in  1S76.  Alexander  is  also  engaged  in  com- 
mercial pursuits  in  the  City  of  Montreal. 

CHARLES  GLACKMEYER 

Was  born  in  Montreal  on  the  22nd  June,  1820.  He  followed  a  complete  course  of 
studies  at  the  Montreal  College  under  the  auspices  of  the  Gentlemen  of  the  Seminary 
of  St.  Sulpice.  He  studied  Law  under  the  late  Messrs.  Peltier  &amp;  Bourret,  and  was 
admitted  to  the  Bar  on  the  loth  October,  1843.  i^^^'o  years  after,  in  1845,  '^^  entered 
the  Corporation  as  Assistant  City  Clerk  of  Montreal,  and  on  the  15th  April,  1859, 
was  appointed  City  Clerk — an  office  which  he  has  continued  to  hold  to  the  present 
day  with  jjcrfect  satisfaction  to  the  various  Mayors  and  Councils  which  have  been 
since  then. 

Mr.  Glackmeyer  has  rendered  important  service  to  the  City  on  many  occasions, 
and  his  services  could  ill  be  sj)ared  to  the  Corporation  of  Montreal.  He  is,  in  his 
official  capacity,  the  right  man  in  the  right  place.

ALBANI— EMMA  LAJEUNESSE. 

This  distinguished  songstress,  a  credit  to  Canada  in  general,  and  Montreal  in  parti- 
cular, was  born  near  Chanibly  some  lliirty-five  or  thirty-six  years  ago.  Losing  her 
mother  when  quite  a  child,  she  and  her  sisters  were  sent  to  the  Convent  of  the 
Sacred  Heart  to  he  educated.  Her  i)roficiency  on  the  organ  was  such  that  in  a  (aw 
years  we  find  her  in  Albany,  New  York,  directing  the  music  and  ofticiating  as  organ- 
ist in  St.  Joseph's  Church  and  giving  lessons  in  vocal  music.  The  Roman  Catholic 
Bishop  seeing  vhat  she  had  extraordinary  talents  sent  her  to  lunope.  iMnally  she 
came  to  Milan,  and  became  a  pupil  of  the  celebrated  J.amperti.  After  studying  some 
time  with  him  it  became  necessary  to  make  a  choice  of  a  stage  name,  and  she  chose 
Albani,  from  the  city  of  her  first  love — the  place  that  recalled  home  and  tender  mem. 
cries,  Albany  in  the  State  of  New  York.  After  singing  in  Malta  she  first  attracted 
the  attention  of  Col.  Mai)leson.  Having  heard  her,he  at  once  offered  her  an  engage- 
ment in  London,  England.  She  accepted  and  made  her  debut  at  Covent  Garden 
'I'heatre,  under  the  direction  of  Mr.  Gye.  There  she  won  a  magnificent  triumph,  and 
ever  since  it  has  been  one  triumphal  career.  The  effect  of  all  this  was,  that  most 
costly  presents  poured  in  upon  her.  In  Berlin  the  Empress  gave  her  a  pair  of  valu- 
able porcelain  vases  from  the  Royal  Pottery;  but  better  still,  she  was  dubbed  then 
"  Hof  Kammer  Sangerin,"  a  "  Royal  Chamber  Singer,"  by  the  luiiperor  himself.  In 
1879,  she  was  presented  by  the  Czar  of  all  the  Russias  at  St.  Petersburg  with  a 
magnificent  set  of  diamond  studded  jewels.  At  the  wedding  of  the  Grand  Duke 
Michael  she  sang  and  shared  in  the  festivities.  In  Brussels,  with  the  characteristic 
generosity  which  distinguishes  her.  she  arranged  a  concert  for  the  sufferers  by  the 
inundations  and  was  presented  with  a  beautiful  wreath  of  silver.  Her  social  position 
is  an  enviable  one,  and  is  acknowledged  throughout  the  world.  The  Queen  of  Eng- 
land, in  acknowledgment  of  her  worth  as  a  wonian  and  greatness  as  an  artist,  has 
received  Madame  Albani  at  lunch,  a  tribute  which  has  never  yet  been  paid  to  any 
other  artist.  Her  progress  has  been  one  continued  triumph.  She  married  Mr. 
Gye  as  a  matter  of  course,  he  who  had  introduced  her  to  future  fame  and  name. 
The  Queen  is  tbnd  of  Albani,  who  now  ])ossesses  a  fine  property  a  few  miles  from 
Balmoral  Castle,  Scotland. 

With  the  two  following  notices  we  close  her  past  career,  and  hope  that  she 
may  yet  for  years  appear  before  the  public  as  one  of  the  most  talented  ("anadians 
that  the  world  ever  saw  : — 

"  In  addition  to  Madame  Albani  having  been  commanded  to  sing  at  \Vindsor 
Castle,  before  the  Queen,  it  may  be  mentioned  as  an  instance  of  the  kindness  of 
Her  Gracious  Majesty  to  her,  that  when  Albani  was  singing  in  Berlin  last  winter, 
1890,  the  Queen  telegraphed  from  the  Isle  of  Wight  to  the  Crown-Princess  of 
Prussia,  specially  recommending  Madame  Albani  to  her  care,  and  asking  the  Prin- 
cess to  do  all  in  her  j)Ower  to  help  her." 

Col.  De  Winton  tells  the  following  :  "  During  the  visit  of  the  Prince  of  Wales 
to  this  country,  in  i860,  in  visiting  the  Convent  of  the  Sacred  Heart,  the  Lady  Su- 
perior introduced  a  child  of  seven  years  old  as  Mile.  Lajeunesse,  wIkj  would  sing 
for  H.R.H.,  when  with  marvellous  sweetness  and  jjower,  that  astonished  the  whole 
company,  the  future  Albani  sang,  '  God  Bless  the  Prince  of  Wales.' "

LOUJS  EDWARD  HUBERT. 

Nearly  two  hundred  and  forty-four  years  ago,  in  the  year  1648,  the  year  in  which 
King  Charles  I.  of  England  was  bel  eaded  by  his  rebellious  subjects,  there  lived  in 
the  City  of  Paris,  in  the  Parish  of  Saint  Genevieve  des  Ardents,  in  the  Archbishopric 
of  that  city,  Ren6  Hubert,  an  honorable  man  and  of  good  position.  He  held  the 
high  appointment  of  Apostolic  Notary  and  Registrar  of  the  Oflicialite  of  Paris  (one 
of  the  most  remarkable  and  highest  of  all  the  Parisian  Courts  of  Law),  His  wife  was 
Anne  Horry,  a  daughter  of  Nicholas  Horry,  wlio,  when  living,  was  also  Apostolic 
Notary  of  the  Parish  of  St.  Nicholas  du  Chardonnel  of  Paris. 

'Vhh  couple  had  a  son  who  figured  in  the  early  history  of  Quebec,  of  the  same 
name  as  his  father,  Rene  Hubert.  When  living,  he  held  the  responsible  position  of 
Registrar  of  the  Provost  Marshal  of  Quebec,  receiving  his  commission  directly  from 
King  Louis  XIV.  of  France,  and  dated  20th  April,  1700.  He  was  also  the  Clerk  of 
Conseil  Superieur,  of  Quebec,  by  commission,  from  April  13th,  1703,  until  his  death, 
ist  September,  1725.  All  the  papers,  edicts,  and  ordinances  of  that  court  from  14th 
June,  1703,  to  I  St  November,  1705,  were  signed  by  him. 

His  son  was  Pierre  Hubert,  who  left  Quebec  to  reside  in  Montreal.  He  married 
Dame  Marie  Joseph  Chartier  de  Beauce.  He  was  a  "  constructeur  de  vaisseaux,'^ 
or  ship  builder,  doing  a  large  business  and  making  latterly  a  good  competency.  The 
subject  of  this  sketch,  Louis  Edward  Hubert,  his  son,  was  born  in  Montreal,  on  the 
i6th  February,  1766,  just  seven  years  after  the  cession  of  Canada  to  Britain,  and  the 
same  year  in  which  the  old  Pretender  to  the  British  throne  died  neglected  at  Rome. 
After  passing  with  ec/dt  all  his  studies  in  the  Colleges  of  Montreal  and  Quebec,  he 
married,  on  the  22nd  November,  1796,  Demoiselle  Marie  Cecil  Cartier,  only  daughter 
of  Jacques  Cartier,  merchant  of  the  Parish  of  St.  Antoine,  River  Richelieu,  and  aunt 
of  the  late  Sir  George  E.  Cartier,  Baronet. 

He  represented  the  County  of  Richelieu  in  the  Parliament  of  Lower  Canada  from 
the  year  1801  to  1805,  and  when  the  War  of  1812  broke  out  between  Great  Britain 
and  the  United  States,  he  was  named  Captain  Quartermaster  of  the  Militia  of  St. 
Denis. 

It  was  in  1813  that  the  combined  movement  of  the  American  armies  took  place, 
their  intention  being  to  invade  Canada  at  different  points.  One  army  of  this  move- 
ment was  to  march  from  tiie  States  by  way  of  Champlain  Lake  and  invade  Montreal. 
The  inhabitants  of  Montreal  District  then  showed  their  loyalty  and  bravery,  and  they 
offered  themselves  voluntarily  to  serve  against  the  invaders. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  holding  an  appointment  in  the  Militia,  with  many  others, 
responded  immediately  to  tiie  appeal  made  by  the  Governor,  and  the  Camp  at  Laprairie 
was  formed,  among  wiiose  citizen  soldiery  were  Joseph  Cartier  of  St.  Antoine,  Col. 
Bourdages  of  St.  Denis,  and  J.  J.  Girouard,  notary,  of  St.  Benoit,  and  an  old  member 
of  the  Provincial  Parliament  of  Lower  Canad.i. 

Mr.  Hubert  died  at  St.  Denis  in  1843,  at  •^he  advanced  age  of  seventy-seven. 
He  left  several  children,  the  only  one  surviving  being  Pierre  David  Hubert,  Doctor  of 
Medicine.  Rene  Auguste  Richard  Hubert,  late  the  Prothonoiary  of  the  Superior 
Court  of  the  City  and  District  of  Montreal,  his  other  son,  died  some  years  ago.

GEORGE    HAGUE. 

Mr.  Hague,  the  well-known  General  Manager  of  the  Merchants'  Bank  of  Canada, 
is  a  native  of  Rotherham,  a  manufacturing  town  in  the  West  Riding  of  Yorkshire, 
England  (a  short  distance  from  Sheffield).  He  is  of  an  old  family  who  have  been 
residents  of  the  same  locality  for  many  generations,  an  ancestor  having  held  a  farm 
in  the  neighborhood  from  the  Earl  of  Strafford,  of  Charles  the  First's  time,  by  the 
curious  old  tenure  of  a  peppercorn  a  year. 

At  an  early  age  he  displayed  a  remarkable  faculty  for  calculation,  and  carried  off 
the  prize  in  mental  arithmetic  against  the  whole  of  a  large  boarding  school  when  only 
eleven  years  old.  In  subsequent  years  at  school  he  was  distinguished  for  industry 
and  application,  and  became  proficient  in  every  branch  of  an  ordinary  English 
education. 

Leaving  school,  he  pursued  for  years,  in  leisure  hours,  a  course  of  private  study 
in  Mathematics,  Logic  and  Languages,  forming  thus  those  habits  of  application, 
concentration  and  accuracy  of  thought  which  have  been  of  signal  service  in  subse- 
quent stages  of  his  career. 

His  arithmetical  proficiency  naturally  led  to  the  choice  of  Banking  as  a  profes- 
sion, and  in  1840  he  was  placed  as  a  junior  in  the  office  of  tlieSiieffield  Banking  Co., 
which  was  then,  and  has  ever  since  continued  to  be,  one  of  the  most  ably  m  aiaged 
banks  in  the  North  of  England.  To  the  thorough  training  received  in  this  institution, 
Mr.  Hague  has  always  attributed  much  of  his  success  as  a  banker  in  Canada. 

A*"'  r  a  service  extending  over  eleven  years  in  this  bank,  he  made  an  engage- 
ment with  a  firm  of  railway  contractors  who  had  large  enterprises  on  hand  in 
Canada,  and  was  sent  out  by  them  in  the  firrst  place  to  New  Brunswick  to  make  an 
audit  of  their  business,  and  afterwards  to  Montreal  to  lake  charge  of  their  office. 
Here  he  remained  until  the  death,  in  the  year  1854,  of  the  senior  partner  of  the  firm 
by  shipwreck.  This  untoward  event,  taking  place  at  the  time  of  the  outbreak  of  the 
Crimean  War,  compelled  a  suspension  and  final  abandonment  of  the  extensive 
operations  in  which  the  firm  was  engaged.  During  these  years  Mr.  Hague  obtained 
an  experience  of  business  and  commercial  life  which  rarely  falls  to  a  banker's  lot. 
The  contracts  undertaken  by  this  firm  anticipated  by  some  twenty-five  years  the  lines 
of  railway  through  the  Ottawa  Valley  and  along  the  North  and  South  shores  of  the 
St.  Lawrence,  which  have  now  become  incorporated  in  the  Canadian  Pacific  system. 

After  the  winding  up  of  the  affairs  of  this  firm,  Mr.  Hague  decided  to  return  to 
banking  as  a  profession,  and  took  service  as  Accountant  with  the  Bank  of  Toronto. 
This  was  in  1856.  To  the  small  beginnings  of  this  now  prosperous  Institution,  Mr. 
Hague  has  referred  in  a  lecture  on  "  Canadian  Banking  "  published  some  years  ago. 

After  several  years'  experience  in  the  Head  Office  of  the  Bank,  he  was  placed 
in  charge  of  one  of  the  Branches  in  which  a  too  enterprising  style  of  management 
had  resulted  in  a  mass  of  undesirable  business.  The  process  of  weeding  and 
trimming  was  a  most  laborious  one,  but  during  its  progress  invaluable  lessons  were 

18 


3^4  GAZETTEER  OF   MONTREAL. 

learned  as  to  the  country  business  of  a  Canadian  Bank,  and  especially  of  that  which 
is  doubtful  and  dangerous.  The  experience  gained  was  a  preparation  for  the  same 
kind  of  work  on  a  far  larger  scale  which  it  fell  to  his  lot  to  accomplish  nearly  twenty 
years  afterwards. 

His  services  in  this  Branch  were  recognised  by  a  transfer  to  the  Head  Office. 
Translated  to  a  higher  sphere,  and  having  an  able  Board  of  Directors  around  him, 
Mr.  Hague  developed  and  extended  the  business  of  the  Bank  on  the  sound  principles 
whicii  he  had  learned  in  England.  He  instituted  a  methodical  system  of  loaning  and 
discounting,  of  the  government  of  branches,  of  inspection,  and  of  supervision,  which 
resulted  in  time  in  placing  the  Bank  in  the  first  rank  of  sound  institutions  in  the 
Dominion. 

It  was  during  his  incumbency  of  office  in  the  Bank  of  Toronto  that  the 
Dominion  Government  made  a  strenuous  effort  to  introduce  the  American  system  of 
currency  into  Canada.  Mr.  Hague  was  among  the  first  to  apprehend  the  dangerous 
consequences  to  the  mercantile  community  and  to  the  Banks  of  this  measure,  and 
took  the  lead  in  a  persistent  opposition  to  it.  The  difficulties  were  great,  for  the 
Government  had  a  strong  majority  at  its  back,  and  at  one  time  it  seemed  as  if  all  hope 
of  successful  opposition  would  have  to  be  abandoned.  He  displayed  in  those 
difficult  circumstances  an  undaunted  spirit,  and  succeeded  in  rallying  the  scattered 
forces  of  those  who  were  with  him  in  sentiment,  and  finally,  by  their  assistance,  in 
winning  over  so  many  influential  members  of  both  Houses  of  Parliament  that  the 
Government  considered  it  prudent  to  withdraw  the  measure. 

After  the  advent  of  Sir  Francis  Hincks  to  office  as  Finance  Minister,  various 
conferences  of  bankers  were  held  with  him,  in  all  which  Mr.  Hague  took  part,  the 
result  being  the  preservation  in  all  its  essential  features  of  a  system  of  &gt;ank 
circulation  which  has  been  of  inestimable  service  in  the  growth  and  development  of 
the  country,  and  which  is  looked  upon  as  a  desirable  model  by  eminent  financiers  in 
the  United  States. 

During  the  whole  progress  of  this  agitation,  which  continued  for  several  years, 
and  necessitated  constant  visits  to  the  seat  of  Government,  close  watch  was  kept 
upon  the  business  of  the  Bank,  which  continued  to  grow  and  prosper  until  it  had 
reached  that  happy  goal  of  all  Bankers  of  that  time,  when  the  "  Reserve  Fund  "  was 
equal  to  one-half  of  the  Capital. 

During  these  years  Mr.  Hague  had  been  actively  engaged  in  hours  of  leisure, 
and  as  opportunity  offered,  in  the  service  of  the  Christian  Church,  and  took  part  in 
various  religious  and  philanthropic  enterprises  in  Toronto.  Some  of  these,  which 
are  now  important  and  flourishing  institutions,  owe  much  of  their  development  to  his 
assiduous  care,  and  this  at  a  time  when  the  full  weight  of  Banking  responsibilities 
was  upon  him. 

So  much,  indeed,  was  his  heart  in  such  enterprises,  that  he  concluded  it  to  be  his 
duty  to  relinquish  his  position  in  the  Bank  in  order  to  devote  to  them  his  whole 
time  and  the  remaining  energies  of  his  life-     This  resolution  was  carried  out.     On 


QAZKTTKKR  OF  MONTRKAL,  275 

the  31st  December,  1876,  lie  severed  his  connection  with  the  Bank  of  Toronto, 
and  witli  the  business  woild  generally,  and  entered  upon  the  service  of  the  Cliristian 
Church  as  a  layman. 

In  less  than  two  months,  however,  events  transpired  which  led  to  a  return  to  his 
old  sphere,  and  to  the  entrance  upon  responsibilities  even  larger  than  any  that  had 
hitherto  fallen  to  his  lot.  The  times  were  difficult,  for  several  years  of  depres- 
sion had  already  passed  over  Canada,  and  every  interest  had  felt  the  effect  of  it. 
Insolvencies  had  been  multiplying  at  an  alarming  rate,  and  the  whole  commercial 
and  financial  atmosphere  was  clouded.  The  full  effect  of  this  state  of  things  fell  with 
great  weight  upon  the  Merchants'  Bank  of  Canada,  an  Institution  which  was  doing 
an  immense  business  in  all  parts  of  Canada,  and  also  carrying  on  extensive  oper- 
ations in  New  York  and  London,  Eng.  It  became  known  that  the  Bank  was  suffer- 
ing severe  losses,  and  its  stock  fell  steadily  downwards.  Efforts  to  stem  the  tide 
proved  unavailable,  and  at  length  meetings  of  stockholders  were  called  to  discuss 
the  position.  These  resulted  in  a  call  for  a  change  of  management.  Thereupon 
the  President,  Sir  Hugh  Allan,  and  the  General-Manager,  Mr.  Jackson  Rae,  botli 
resigned  their  positions.  The  Hon.  John  Hamilton  was  immediately  elected  President, 
and  Mr.  John  McLennan,  Vice-President.  These,  changes,  however,  did  not  i)revent  a 
drain  of  deposits  from  going  on,  and  the  Bank  was  rapidly  drifting  to  the  point  when 
a  stoppage  would  have  been  inevitable.  It  was  under  these  circumstances  that  an 
appeal  was  made  to  Mr.  Hague  to  assume  the  general  management  of  the  Bank.  The 
crisis  was  urgent.  There  was  little  time  for  consideration,  and  after  such  an  e.xam- 
ination  of  the  Bank's  position  as  could  be  had,  with  assurances  of  support  from 
other  banks  and  of  active  co-operation  from  the  Board  of  Directors,  he  assumed 
charge  of  the  Institution  about  the  latter  end  of  February,  1877,  removing  to 
Montreal  for  the  purpose.  It  was  said  at  the  time  by  one  of  the  daily  journals  that  it 
would  be  a  tremendous  task  to  wade  through  the  masses  of  securities  and  bills  possessed 
by  the  Bank,  together  with  the  diversified  assets  of  many  insolvent  estates  with  which 
it  was  encumbered,  but  that  the  work  must  be  done  before  the  Bank  could  be 
put  upon  a  proper  foundation.     The  Board  lent  a  zealous  co-operation  to  the  task. 

The  staff  of  the  Bank  worked  vigorously  in  the  same  direction.  The  whole 
internal  economy  of  the  Bank  was  overhauled  and  strengthened.  Unprofitable 
Branches  were  closed.  Large  operations  in  which  the  Bank  had  engaged,  in 
connection  with  the  first  Quebec  Provincial  Loan,  and  also  with  the  gold  market  of 
New  York,  were  brought  to  a  termination  ;  while  zealous  care  was  exercised 
in  preserving  such  business  as  was  sound  and  valuable.  The  task  of  reforma- 
tion and  reconstruction  proved,  however,  to  be  a  far  heavier  one  than  any  person  had 
anticipated.  Insolvent  estates  amounting  in  the  aggregate  to  many  millions  had  to 
be  dealt  with  in  the  way  of  settlement,  and  before  the  Annual  Meeting,  in  July,  it 
became  apparent  that  a  heavy  reduction  of  capital  would  be  required  in  order  to 
place  the  Bank  upon  a  solid  foundation.  The  necessary  authority  for  this  was 
granted  by  Parliament  during  the  ensuing  session,  but  many  years  of  toil  and  labor 


tjft  OAZETTF.ER   OK   MONTREAL. 

elapsed  before  the  Bank  was  in  a  position  whicli  justified  the  Board  in  looking  upon 
it  with  satisfaction.  During  the  whole  of  this  period  an  amount  of  labor  became 
necessary  far  beyond  what  is  customary  amongst  Bankers,  constantly  protracted  to 
late  hours  of  the  night,  and  whicli  would  have  proved  exhausting  but  for  those  habits 
of  persevering  application  of  which  the  foundation  had  been  laid  by  Mr.  Hague  many 
years  before.  There  is  also  another  word  to  be  said.  Those  who  know  the  subject  of 
this  memoir  are  aware  that  he  is  not  given  to  obtruding  religious  matters  in  conver- 
sation. But  they  know  well  that  he  has  stated  repeatedly  that  but  for  strength  from 
a  Higher  than  any  human  source  he  must  have  been  utterly  broken  down  by  the 
experience  passed  through  during  these  adverse  years. 

The  clor.ds,  however,  broke  at  length.  In  1881,  a  marked  improvement  in  trade 
took  place,  and  the  country  began  to  recover  prosperity.  The  credit  of  the  Bank 
was  thorougiily  re-established,  and  Mr.  Hague  stated  at  an  annual  meeting  of  stock 
holders  that,  notwithstanding  the  severe  process  of  pruning  and  weeding  that  had 
been  necessary,  the  Bank  had  retained  all  the  valuable  business  thai  had  formerly 
belonged  to  it.  The  history  of  the  JJank  for  the  last  ten  years  has  been  one  of  steady 
growth  and  increasing  prosperity. 

During  the  period  of  Mr,  Hague's  incumbency  of  the  general  management  the 
whole  subject  of  Banking  has  been  twice  brought  before  Parliament  in  connection 
with  the  renewal  of  the  Bank  charters.  On  the  first  occasion,  in  iHSo,  the  (piesliou 
again  arose  of  assimilating  the  circulation  of  Canadian  J}anks  to  that  of  the  Uiuled 
States.  The  Finance  Minister  of  the  time  favored  this  idea,  but  on  the  strong 
representations  made  by  a  majority  of  Bankers  the  project  was  again  abandoned. 
It  fell  to  Mr.  Hague's  lot,  at  the  request  of  the  Bankers  convened  in  Ottawa,  to 
present  to  the  Finance  Minister  their  views  on  this  question. 

In  1890,  it  became  known  that  the  Government  were  proposing  considerable  modi- 
fications in  the  Banking  Law,  and  Mr.  Hague  took  the  initiative  in  calling  a  con- 
ference of  the  Bankers  of  the  Dominion  to  consider  the  changes  proposed.  In  the 
discussion  that  followed  he  naturally  took  part,  and  also  in  the  interviews  that  were 
had  with  the  Finance  Minister  and  the  Privy  Council  on  the  subject. 

For  some  years  back  it  has  been  customary  with  the  general  management  of 
large  banking  institutions  in  Canada,  followuig  Blnglish  precedents,  to  deliver  an 
address  at  the  Annual  Meeting,  reviewing  not  only  tiie  business  of  the  Bank  itself,  but 
the  position  and  prospects  of  the  trade  of  tiie  country.  The  addresses  of  Mr.  Hague 
from  year  to  year  have  been  noted  for  their  comprehensive  and  practical  character, 
being  eminently  readable,  devoid  of  technical  and  abstruse  discussion,  dwelling  on 
matters  of  universal  business  interest,  and  have  been  widely  read  and  commented 
upon  both  in  Canada  and  the  United  States. 

So  far  with  regard  to  the  practical  position  of  Mr.  Hague's  banking  career.  He 
has,  however,  been  active  in  the  theoretical  as  well  as  in  the  practical  sphere  of 
Banking.  His  contributions  to  the  Press  on  financial  subjects  have  been  carried 
on  without  intermission  for  more  than  twenty  years,  in  the  shape  of  leading  articles 


GAZETTEER  OF  MONTREAL.  tfj 

in  financial  journials.  His  addresses  to  Bankers  in  tiie  United  Slates  at  the  annual 
meeting  of  their  Associations  have  been  received  with  marked  approval,  and  all  of 
them  are  now  in  print  in  pamphlet  form.  Amongst  other  addresses  was  one  delivered 
before  the  British  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science,  when  it  met  in 
Montreal,  four  years  ago.  Few  men  in  Canada  have  written  as  much  on  banking 
and  financial  subjects,  or  done  more  to  diffuse  sound  principles,  to  expose  prevalent 
errors,  and  bring  about  honorable  and  wise  methods  of  business,  or  to  warn  the 
community  against  commercial  rocks  and  shoals,  and  generally  to  promote  the  per- 
manent prosperity  of  the  country. 

Mr.  Hague  has  long  taken  a  warm  interest  in  the  young  men  of  Canada, and 
has  been  identified  with  the  Young  Men's  Christian  Association  and  other  agencies 
for  their  improvement.  ]}efore  this  body  he  has  delivered  papers  and  addresses 
on  various  subjects,  most  of  which  have  been  piinted.  He  has  taken  special  i)ains 
to  educate  llie  young  men  who  have  at  various  times  served  under  liim  in  his  banking 
career,  and  has  had  the  satisfaction  of  seeing  many  of  them  rise  to  prominent  positions 
in  the  banking  world.  He  was  for  many  years  Chairman  of  the  Congregational  College 
of  Canada,  and  is  one  of  the  Governors  of  McGili  University.  For  mere  parly  poli- 
tics he  has  no  particular  taste,  but  has  for  some  lime  been  a  member  of  llie  Imperial 
Federation  League,  and  lias  always  taken  a  deep  interest  in  the  development  of 
Canada  as  an  integral  portion  of  the  British  Empire. 

He  has  lately  been  honored  by  the  Privy  Council  of  Canada  in  being  appointed 
Chairman  of  the  Royal  Commission  to  enquire  into  the  working  of  the  ('ivil 
Service  of  the  Dominion. 

THOMAS  STORROW  BROWN 

Was  born  at  St.  Andrews,  New  Brunswick,  on  the  7th  of  May,  1803.  His  grand- 
father was  a  lioston  merchant,  who  sacrificed  his  all  for  the  Royal  cause,  and  left 
that  city  for  Halifax  in  1776,  when  Boston  was  evacuated  by  General  Gage.  His 
grandmother  was  the  granddaughter  of  John  Wentworlh,  and  niece  of  Sir  Benning 
Wentworth  and  cousin  of  John  Wentworlh  (afterwards  Sir  John,  Governor  of  Nova 
Scotia),  who  in  succession  were  the  three  last  Royal  Governors  of  New  Hampshire. 
She  accompanied  to  New  Brunswick  a  son-in-law,  Captain  Thomas  Storrow,  of  the 
British  Army.  On  the  approach  of  war  with  the  United  Slates  in  t8ii,  when  friends 
on  the  opposite  side  of  the  River  St.  Croix  were  to  become  enemies,  Mr.  JJrown 
retired  as  far  as  possible  from  the  frontier  to  Woodstock  in  the  Stale  of  Vermont. 
From  this  place,  his  son,  the  subject  of  this  sketch,  in  May,  1818,  then  fifteen 
years  old,  came  friendless  and  alone  to  Montieal,  to  enter  the  hardware  store  of  Mr. 
J.  T.  Barrett.  In  1825,  he  commenced  the  hardware  business  on  his  own  account» 
and  in  a  few  years  had  one  of  the  largest  establishments  of  this  trade  in  the  city, 
which  he  gave  up  in  1835,  devoting  himself  to  public  matters  and  land  speculations. 
In  1832,  he  was  one  of  the  principal  organizers  of  the   Vindicator  newspaper,  and 


278  GAZETTEER  OF  MONTREAL. 

soon  became  a  public  writer.  He  was  the  most  active  promoter  of  the  Charter  of 
the  City  Bank,  whicli  commenced  business  in  1833,  and  soon  after  equally  active  in 
organizing  the  Banque  du  Peuplc,  of  which  he  was  one  of  the  first  directors.  In  the 
summer  of  1834,  ihe  law  for  the  protection  of  emigrants  had  expired,  and  there  was 
no  office  or  provision  for  them  in  Montreal.  Suddenly  the  cholera  broke  out,  creat- 
ing universal  panic  ;  the  city  being  without  funds,  applied  to  Lord  Aylmer,  then 
Governor  General,  for  an  advance,  but  was  refused  ;  the  Mayor  called  a  meeting  of 
the  citizens,  and  in  this  way  related  his  position,  when  Mr.  Brown  moved  and  carried 
a  resolution  naming  himself  and  four  other  citizens,  Felix  Souligne,  Toiissaint  Peltier, 
James  Duncan  Gibb,  and  Francois  Desautels,  as  a  committee,  to  do  all  things  need- 
ful. These  gentlemen  at  once  assumed  full  authority,  and  with  their  own  funds 
established  Cholera  Hospitals  and  shelter  for  emigrants,  furnished  provisions  to  all  in 
need,  forwarded  daily  to  their  destination  all  who  were  in  health,  paying  the  passage 
of  all  who  had  come  destitute.  Mr.  Brown  devoted  every  morning  to  attendance  in 
the  hospital,  and  the  afternoon  to  forwarding  emigrants.  In  all  public  agitation  up 
to  the  fall  of  1837,  '^'''  Brown,  being  in  daily  communication  with  Mr.  Papineau  and 
other  leaders  of  his  party,  was  among  the  most  active  and  ubiquitous  in  writing  and 
public  speaking.  He  wrote  a  series  of  letters,  signed  Z.  M.  N.,  to  the  Nc7ii  York 
Express,  on  the  affairs  of  Canada.  When  the  Sons  of  Liberty  were  organized  in 
August,  he  was  chosen  General  of  that  body.  On  the  sixth  of  November,  when 
returning  home  alone  after  their  last  meeting,  he  was  assailed  by  a  body  of  the 
opposite  i^arty,  and  nearly  beaten  to  death,  losing  the  sight  of  his  right  eye,  which 
he  never  recovered. 

The  injuries  thus  sustained  confined  him  to  his  home  till  the  i6th  November, 
when  hearing  that  a  warrant  for  high  treason  was  issued  against  him  he  went  down 
to  Point  aux  Trembles,  from  which,  after  passing  a  day  in  bed  on  an  island,  he 
crossed  to  Varennes.  When  at  supper  there  he  was  joined  by  Alphonse  Gouvin 
and  Rodolph  Desrivieres,  two  chiefs  of  the  Sons  of  Liberty,  who,  by  accident,  arrived 
at  the  same  time.  These  three  determined  to  establish  a  Military  camp  at  St. 
Charles.  Riding  over  night  they  accomplished  this  the  following  morning.  Mr. 
Brown  being  too  weak  for  action,  his  two  associates  completed  the  preparations. 
The  people  of  the  village  and  county,  supposing  that  a  general  rising  had  commenced, 
came  to  the  camp  in  great  numbers,  and  such  as  had  arms  of  any  kind,  to  the 
number  of  about  two  hundred,  remained. 

Trees  were  felled  to  form  defensive  works,  but  as  there  was  not  time  to 
throw  up  earthworks  it  was  merely  a  log  fence,  nor  were  there  officers  or  military 
organizations.  At  the  same  time  Dr.  Wolfred  Nelson  had  collected  a  number  of 
armed  men  at  St.  Denis,  for  the  defence  of  that  place.  When  news  reached  Montreal 
of  these  doings,  Col.  Gore  was  sent  with  a  force  against  St.  Denis,  by  way  of  Sorel, 
and  Col.  Wetherall  to  St.  Charles,  with  a  brigade  of  infantry,  two  pieces  of  field  artil- 
lery and  a  small  body  of  cavalry.  Resting  a  day  at  St.  Hilaire,  and  the  roads  being 
good  and  weather  fine,  on  the  25 th  November  he  marched  rapidly  to  St.  Charles, 


'      •  GAZETTEER    OF   MONTREAL.  279 

using  the  ordinary  military  stratagem  in  an  open  level  country  of  setting  fire  to  a  few 
barns  as  he  approached.  The  great  columns  of  smoke  and  tiame  bursting  up  from 
them  produced  its  usual  terror,  and  the  country  people  came  flocking  before  him. 
In  the  midst  of  this  Mr.  Brown  was  thrown  to  the  frozen  ground  from  his  horse, 
with  a  shock  that  in  ordinary  times  would  have  knocked  him  senseless,  but  mounLmg 
again  he  endeavored  to  restore  what  order  he  could. 

In  the  camp  were  less  than  a  hundred  men  wjio  made  a  heroic  stand,  but  the 
firing  of  Colonel  Wetherall's  musketry  and  guns  soon  scattered  all,  except  about 
thirty,  who  were  killed,  and  whose  names  have  been  carefully  and  religiously  pre- 
served. All  order  being  ended,  and  Atr.  Brown  finding  himself  only  one  among  the 
many,  proceeded  about  nightfiill  to  St.  Denis,  where  he  joined  Dr.  Wolfred  Nelson, 
and  after  returning  for  a  day  to  St.  Charles,  remained  with  him  for  a  week.  On  the 
2nd  of  December,  they  left  with  four  companions  for  the  States.  Cetting  separated, 
all  were  captured  except  Mr.  Brown,  who,  by  passing  through  the  woods,  and  lodging 
in  barns,  reached  the  United  States,  on  the  9th  of  December,  after  many  romantic 
adventures,  having  been  obliged  to  sustain  life  on  raw  peas,  etc.  He  now  found  that 
$2,000  had  been  offered  for  his  apprehension.  Subsequently  he  was  by  a  decree  of 
Lord  Durham  declared  guilty  of  high  treason,  to  be  punished  accordingly,  if  found 
in  Her  Majesty's  dominions.  Taking  no  part  in  the  border  disturbances  he  went  to 
Florida  in  1838,  being  occupied  while  there  with  public  questions.  In  the  spring  of 
1844,  hearing  that  a  Nolle  Prosequi  had  been  entered  in  his  case  in  Montreal,  by  the 
Attorney  General  of  Canada,  Mr.  Lafontaine,  for  what  reason  he  never  knew,  he 
returned  to  this  city,  welcomed  by  his  old  acquaintances  of  all  parties  as  one  who 
had  merely  returned  from  a  journey. 

Finding  his  land  operations,  after  six  years'  neglect,  all  in  ruin,  he  returned  to 
the  hardware  trade,  in  which  he  continued  until  1862,  when  he  was  appointed  by  the 
Macdonald-Dorion  Government  Chairman  of  a  Commission  to  inquire  into  the  posi- 
tion of  the  Public  Departments,  and  their  manner  of  keeping  accounts.  In  1864,  he 
was  the  first  named  official  assignee  under  the  Insolvent  Act  of  that  year.  Mr. 
Brown  was  married  in  1829  to  Miss  Jane  Hughes,  who  died  in  1833,  leaving  one 
daughter.  He  was  again  married  in  i860  to  Mrs.  Hestor  Livingstone,  of  St.  Augustine, 
Florida.  His  connection  with  the  Board  of  Trade  has  been  from  its  earliest  day. 
He  has  held  a  high  social  position  as  a  man  of  honor  and  cultivation,  his  connection 
with  the  press  as  an  independent  and  popular  writer  on  all  social  questions  has  been 
continual,  and  he  has  been  prominent  in  all  matters  connected  with  Temperance 
Reform.  When  looking  back  on  his  long  eventful  life,  and  especially  to  1837,  ^[r. 
Brown  saw  what  he  and  his  compatriots  fought  and  bled  for.  We  have  now  the 
blessings  of  Constitutional  Government  and  a  free,  loyal  and  prosperous  commu- 
nity, thanks  to  him  and  the  Fils  de  la  Liberie  of  1837.

EDMUND  BARNARD,  Q.C., 
Was  born  at  Three  Rivers,  on  23rd  January,  1831.  He  is  a  son  of  Edward  Barnard, 
for  many  years  Prothonotary  of  Three  Rivers,  whose  family  was  originally  from 
Yorkshire,  England,  settled  at  an  early  day  in  the  history  of  the  Colonies,  at  Deer- 
field,  Mass.,  and  immigrated  thence  into  Canada.  Mr.  Barnard  received  his  education 
in  the  Colleges  of  St.  Hyacinlhe,  Nicolet  and  Montreal,  and  took  his  degrees  of  B.A. 
and  M.A.  at  St.  John's  College,  Fordhani,  N.Y.  He  studied  Law  in  the  office  of 
Judge  Polette,  in  Three  Rivers  ;  also  with  Sir  John  Rose  and  the  late  Mr.  Justice 
Monk,  of  the  Court  of  Appeals,  and  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  on  the  23rd  of  October, 
1853.  Mr.  Barnard  is  known  as  one  of  the  most  studious,  painstaking  and  successful 
lawyers  in  Montreal.  He  has  made  a  specialty  of  certain  branches,  such  as  real 
estate,  French  law,  municipal  law,  and  law  of  banks  and  corporations,  he  having 
a  very  extensive  clientele  in  tliose  several  departments.  He  often  visits  England  to 
attend  to  Canadian  cases  before  the  Judicial  Committee  of  the  Privy  Council.  A 
fellow  member  of  the  Montreal  Bar  gives  Mr.  Barnard  credit  for  having  a  very  keen 
perception  of  the  old  French  law — second  to  that  of  no  other  lawyer  in  the  province, 
for  being  a  very  indefatigable  worker  in  preparing  his  cases,  and  for  being  a  fluent 
and  strong  Advocate,  equally  good  in  the  French  and  English  languages.  In  1858, 
Mr.  Barnard  was  married  to  Ellen  King,  daughter  of  the  Hon.  C.  L.  Austin,  Recorder 
of  the  City  of  Albany,  N.Y.     His  son  is  associated  with  him  in  his  office, 

REV.  J.  U.  LECLERC 
Was  born  at  Isle  Bazarre,  August  7th,  1836.  He  is  the  son  of  Francis  LecL re, 
farmer,  and  Josephte  Demers,  his  wife.  While  still  a  youth,  his  parents  determined 
to  dedicate  their  son  to  the  service  of  the  Church,  and  with  this  object  in  view  his 
education  was  properly  attended  to.  He  took,  first,  a  Classical  course  at  Montreal 
College,  after  studying  Philosophy  at  St.  Mary's  College,  Montreal,  and  St.  Michael's 
College,  Toronto.  He  next  went  to  Sandwich  College,  as  Professor,  in  1858,  but  soon 
resigned  this  position  to  enter  on  a  course  of  study  in  Theology  at  the  Cirand  Seminary 
at  Montreal,  being  ordained  Priest  in  June,  1862.  His  first  clerical  charge  was  at 
Vaudreuil,  where  he  was  Curate  for  two  years.  In  1865,  he  left  Yaudreuil,  having 
been  appointed  Chaplain  of  the  Reformatory  Prison  at  St.  Vincent  de  Paul.  In 
1873,  he  was  appointed  Chaplain  to  the  great  Penitentiary  there,  and  for  the  ten  years 
following  he  filled  that  very  important  post  with  great  acceptability  to  the  officers  of 
the  institution,  who  were  deeply  struck  with  the  Chaplain's  piety,  and  the  zeal  with 
which  he  ministered  to  the  spiritual  wants  of  the  many  unfortunate  outcasts  from 
society  who  were  confined  within  its  walls.  In  1883,  Father  Leclerc  was  transferred 
to  the  important  parish  of  St.  Joseph's,  Richmond  street,  Montreal,  where  he  has  since 
ministered.  He  is  also  Pastor  of  St.  Anthony's  Parish,  for  the  English-speaking 
classes  of  St.  Joseph's  and  St.  Cunegonde,  by  whom  he  is  much  beloved.  About  four 
years  ago  he  visited  Manitoba,  and  was  much  impressed  with  the  richness  of  the 
country,  and  the  immense  resources  of  the  Northwest  Territories.  He  has  also  twice 
visited  the  Maritime  Provinces,  and  has  thus  a  good  knowledge  of  the  topography  of 
the  Dominion  from  personal  observation.

CLEOPHAS  BEAUSOLEIL,  M.P., 

Was  born  iglh  June,  1845,  at  St.  Felix  de  Valois,  County  of  Joliette.  Fourth  son  of 
Joseph  Beausoleil  and  of  Rose  Ducharmc.  He  was  educated  at  the  Academy  of 
Berthier  and  at  Joliette  College.  He  came  to  Montreal  in  August,  1864,  and  studied 
Law  at  the  office  of  Messrs.  Bclanger  &amp;  Desnoyers,  now  judges.  In  1866,  his  love 
of  politics  induced  him  to  enter  journalism.  He  wrote  first  for  Z'(7;v//v,  then  for 
L'Eveneiiient.  In  1868,  he  became  one  of  the  editors  of  Le  Nouveau  Monde  under 
Mr.  Joseph  Royal,  now  Lieutenant-Governor  of  the  North  \Vest,  and  chief  editor  in 
1870,  a  position  he  occupied  until  1873,  when  he  established  Lc  Bieii  Fiib'ic  in  co- 
parlnershi])  with  Mr.  L.  O.  David.  His  career  as  a  political  writer  was  one  of  the 
brightest.  In  1875,  ^'^''*  Beausoleil  left  politics  and  was  appointed  Official  Assignee, 
in  which  office  he  obtained  the  confidence  of  the  trade  and  acquired  quite  a  com- 
petency. In  1880,  ]Mr.  Beausoleil  resumed  his  legal  studies,  and  was  admitted  to  the 
Bar,  July,  1880.  Six  months  later  he  entered  into  partnership  with  Hon.  Honorei 
Mercier,  Premier  of  the  Province  of  Quebec,  and  the  firm  still  exists  under  the  name 
of  Mercier,  Beausoleil,  Choquet  &amp;  Martineau.  In  1882,  Mr.  Beausoleil  contested 
St.  James  Ward  for  the  Municipal  Council  against  Alderman  Louis  Ailard,  and  was 
elected  by  221  votes  of  a  majority  after  one  of  the  bitterest  contests  on  record.  He 
was  re-elected  by  acclamation  in  1885,  ''•'^^  resigned  in  18S8.  His  principal  works 
in  the  Council  were  the  repeal  of  the  Abattoir  ]\Ionopoly,  the  repeal  of  the  Statute 
Labor  Tax  and  the  annexation  of  Hochelaga  and  St.  Jean  Baptisle  A'ards,  thus 
giving  the  control  of  the  city  to  the  French  element.  In  1867,  Mr.  Beausoleil  was 
elected  to  the  House  of  Commons  for  the  County  of  Berthier,  defeating  the  late 
member,  Mr.  Robillard,  by  a  majority  of  231.  He  was  re-elected  in  March,  1871, 
defeating  Mr.  Victor  Ailard  by  157  votes.  Mr.  Beausoleil  has  taken  a  prominent 
part  in  some  very  important  debates,  such  as  the  Reciprocity,  Dual  Language  and 
Beet-root  Sugar  debates.  Mr.  Beausoleil  speaks  as  he  writes,  with  knowledge  of 
the  subject,  clearness  of  exjiression,  going  straight  to  the  point  and  bringing  all  the 
arguments  in  the  most  lucid  manner.  Mr.  Beausoleil  is  a  National-Liberal,  devoted 
to  his  Church,  to  his  country  and  to  his  party.  He  is  one  of  the  most  trusted 
Lieutenants  of  Hon.  Wilfred  Laurier.  He  has  once  more  (Feb.,  1892)  been  elected 
by  acclamation  as  one  of  the  Aldermen  of  the  City  of  Montreal.

MICHAEL  PATRICK  RYAN. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  at  Palis,  in  the  County  of  Tipperary,  one  of  tlie 
finest  and  most  delightful  counties  of  the  many  such  in  Ireland,  on  the  29th  Sep- 
tember, 1824.  He  is  the  third  son  of  William  and  Mary  Ryan.  He  received  his 
education  tliere,  and  at  an  early  date  came  to  Montreal  and  commenced  business. 
He  married,  in  1850,  Margaret,  eldest  daughter  of  the  late  Patrick  Brennan,  Esq.,  of 
this  city.  Mr.  Ryan  was  at  one  time  one  of  the  most  extensive  merchants  in  Mon- 
real  in  his  own  line,  which  was  that  of  produce,  and  ranked  amongst  the  merchant 
princes  of  the  great  Canadian  Metropolis.  He  has  been  most  active  in  the  welfare 
and  prosperity  of  his  adopted  city.  He  was  Vice-President  of  the  Artisans'  Mutual 
Building  Society,  and  a  Director  of  the  Metropolitan  Bank,  of  which  the  well-known 
Honorable  Henry  Starnes  was  at  one  time  the  Ma:nager.  He  was  also  a  Director  of 
the  Northern  Colonization  Railway,  and  is  the  President  of  the  Local  Directors  of 
the  Confederation  Life  Association.  He  is  also  a  Justice  of  the  Peace  for  the  District 
and  City  of  Montreal.  Whilst  he  was  a  member  of  the  Corn  Exchange  Association 
he  had  the  high  honor  of  three  times  being  elected  to  serve  as  the  President.  He  was 
a  Harbor  Commissioner  from  August,  1873,  to  August,  1874. 

In  1868,  Canada  lost  her  noblest  adopted  child,  Thomas  D'Arcy  McGee.  The 
election  that  preceded  that  Statesman's  last  return  to  Parliament  had  been  conducted 
with  a  bitterness  unprecedented  in  the  annals  of  electioneering  warfare.  The  passion 
of  the  multitude  had  not  subsided  when  the  tragic  event  occurred  that  sent  poor 
McGee  to  an  untimely  end.  Many  of  the  Protestant  population,  with  whom  he  was 
a  great  favorite,  registered  a  vow  that  no  Irish  Catholic  should  be  his  successor. 
The  moment  was  a  trying  one.  Had  the  tacit  understanding  as  to  the  representation 
of  Montreal  in  the  House  of  Parliament  been  then  broken  through,  it  is  imi)Ossible 
to  say  what  might  have  been  the  result  politically  ;  but  in  any  case  it  must  have  proved 
disastrous  to  tiie  interests  of  the  Irish  Catholics.  Meeting  after  meeting  was  held  to 
bring  forward  a  candidate ;  the  names  of  many  prominent  citizens  were  mentioned ; 
but  the  Protestant  section  refused  to  hear  of  any  unless  Mr.  M.  P.  Ryan,  who  had 
jnost  emphatically  refused  to  offer  himself,  should  be  the  candidate.  No  doubt  those 
who  desired  to  see  the  Irish  people  deprived  of  their  representation,  never  dreamt 
that  Mr.  Ryan  would  consent  to  sacrifice  his  business,  involving  hundreds  of  thousands 
of  dollars  annually,  for  the  profitless  task  to  him  of  sitting  in  Parliament,  and  the 
late  Mr.  Morland,  a  gentleman  of  high  standing,  was  ready  in  the  background  to 
step  forward,  with  the  whole  support  of  the  Government,  to  snatch  the  coveted  prize. 
Mr.  Ryan's  patriotism  had  now  to  stand  a  severe  test.  His  fellow-countrymen,  those 
who  had,  with  himself,  followed  the  fortunes  of  the  late  lamented  McGee,  and  those 
who  had  fought  hardest  on  the  other  side,  were  clustered  around  him,  and,  responsive 
to  the  solicitations  of  clergy  and  laity,  he  consented  to  accept  the  candidature  that  he 
in  no  way  desired,  and  which,  whilst  it  preserved  the  seat  to  his  fellow-countrymen 
and  co-religionists,  was  destined  to  be  one  of  the  causes  of  the  great  commercial 
misfortunes  that  overtook  him  later  on.  Thus,  however,  was  finally  settled  the 
question  of  Irish-Catholic  representation  in  the  City  of  Montreal,  and  so  effectually 


GAZETTKER   OF   MONTREAL.  283 

that  no  political  party,  without  counting  inevitable  defeat,  can  afford  to  trample 
upon  that  acknowledged  right.  Mr.  Ryan  was,  therefore,  elected  by  acclamation  in 
1868,  and  again  in  1872.  In  the  memorable  campaign  of  1874,  the  late  Mr.  Devlin 
opposed  Mr.  Ryan,  but  was  defeated  by  383  votes.  On  a  subsequent  occasion,  the 
seat  having  been  declared  vacant,  Mr.  Devlin  succeeded  in  carrying  the  election  by 
a  majority  of  73;  but,  at  the  General  Election  following  (1878),  Mr.  Ryan  defeated 
Mr.  Devlin  by  the  sweeping  majority  of  802. 

In  Parliament,  Mr.  Ryan  occupied  positions  on  most  of  the  important  com- 
mittees of  the  House.  He  seldom  spoke  except  on  questions  affecting  the  interests 
of  the  people  he  more  especially  represented,  and  on  subjects  affecting  the  fiscal 
policy  of  the  country,  wlien  he  commanded  universal  attention  and  respect.  His 
devotion  to  his  party  was  well  known,  but  it  had  never  led  him  so  far  as  to  swerve 
for  one  moment  from  the  strict  path  of  duty.  On  the  New  Brunswick  school  question, 
in  the  exciting  and  bitter  controversy  on  the  Manitoban  difficulty,  in  a  Mord,  on 
every  occasion  where  manly  independence  was  necessary,  Mr.  Ryan  showed  that  by 
voice  and  vote  he  was  prepared  to  stand  by  the  good  cause,  let  the  consequences  to 
Government  or  political  parties  be  what  they  might.  During  his  long  and  useful 
career,  Mr.  Ryan  connected  himself  with  many  organizations  for  the  moral  and  social 
improvement  of  his  people,  but  with  none  more  actively  than  the  St.  Patrick's 
Temperance  Society,  of  which  he  was  President  for  several  years.  Many  is  the  weak 
and  erring  man  his  kind  word  has  comforted,  and  his  noble  example  strengthened  in 
his  resolve  to  turn  over  a  new  leaf,  and  adhere  to  that  total  abstinence  which  has 
effected  so  much  good  everywhere,  but  in  no  instance  more  markedly  than  amongst 
the  Irish  people. 

In  1882,  Mr.  Ryan  retired  from  public  life  to   take  the  position  of  Collector  of 

Customs  at  the  Port  of  Montreal,  and  was  succeeded  by  the  present  member,  J.  J. 

Curran,  M.P. 

JOSEPH  BRUNET 

Was  born  at  St.  Vincent  de  Paul,  26th  November,  1835.  His  father  was  also  of  the 
same  name  and  of  that  village.  The  family  went  to  Laprairie  when  Mr.  Brunet  was 
thirteen  years  old,  and  after  four  years  he  came  to  Montreal  and  was  apprenticed  to 
a  large  building  firm.  At  the  age  of  twenty-one  he  began  business  on  his  own  account, 
and  by  strict  assiduity  and  correct  management  of  his  affairs,  has  acquired  the  position 
he  now  holds.  In  February,  1871,  he  was  elected  as  Councillor  for  the  St.  Louis 
Ward,  and  since  that  dale  for  some  years  he  continued  to  represent  the  Ward,  being 
for  two  years  elected  as  Alderman. 

He  is  one  of  the  Directors  of  the  Metropolitan  Building  Society,  also  of  the  St. 
James',  also  the  Canada,  and  of  the  Magog  Association  for  giving  cheap  and  healthy 
residences  in  the  country  to  those  who  are  members  of  the  Society.  His  place  of 
business  is  on  Mignonne  street.  He  was  elected  to  the  Local  Provincial  Legislature 
for  Montreal  last  General  Elections,  and  is  now  awaiting  the  result  of  March  8th 
next — what  the  General  Elections  caused  by  the  dismissal  of  the  Mercier  Government 
will  bring  forth.

THOMAS  FORTIN,  LL.  L. 

He  was  born  in  St.   Frangois,   Beauce,   7th   December,  1853,  conscfjuently  he  is 
thirty-nine  years  of  age.     He  was  educated  first  at   the  elementary  school  of  tlie 
locahty  up  to  the  age  of  twelve,  then  went  away  to  the  State  of  Minnesota  for  two 
years,  after  which  he  tried  farming,  and   then  travelled  in  the  Eastern  States  for  a 
couple   of  years.     After   this  he   was  apprenticed  to  a  blacksmith  for  six  months. 
Afterwards  he  really  worked  by  the  day  on  the  Quebec  Central  Railway,  near  Sher- 
brooke,  for  some  time  in  1872,  so  determined  was  he  to  get  the  means  to  prosecute 
his  further  studies.     From  there  he  went  to  the  Military  School  of  Quebec,  where 
the  usual  certificate  was  obtained.     It  was  when  he  was  in  Quebec  attending  the 
Military  School  tliat  he  met  some  friends  who  thought  he  could  do  something  else 
than  travel  about  and  work  by  the  day.     Witli  the  assistance  of  his  parents,  and  with 
the  few   dollars  earned  by  the  pick  and  shovel,  he  attended  Mr.  W.  Thom's  Com- 
mercial Academy  for  one  year.     He  then  entered  the  employ  of  Fyfe  &amp;  Garneau,  dry 
goods  store,  as  bookkeeper,  and  was  there  and  elsewhere  until  the  15th  November, 
1876,  when  he  came  to  Montreal  in  search  of  a  better  situation.     Through  the  pro- 
tection and  recommendation  of  a  friend  in  Quebec,  he  entered  as  bookkeeper  in  the 
Canadian   Rubber  Co.,  and  remained   until   March,    1879,     Whilst    there,  he    met 
friends  who  were  taking  night  lessons  from  the  late  L'Abbe  ('handonnet,  one  of  the 
best  teachers  ever  known  in  Canada.     He  joined  the  class  of  L'Abbe  Chandonnet  in 
January,  1878,  and  in  January,  1879,  was  admitted  to  the  study  of  Law  without  oral 
examination,  and  with  much  congratulations  from  examiners  on  his  proficiency  and 
advancement.     He  then  entered  the  office  of  the   Hon.  J.  K.  Robidoux,  in  March. 
1879,  ^'•s  'I  student,  and  followed  the  Law  course  at  Laval,  Montreal.     He  graduated 
there  in  Law,  in  June,  1881,  obtaining  the  degree  of  LL.  L.,  Sutfima  cum  iaude,  the 
highest  degree  obtainable,  at  the  end  of  the  course.     He  was  admitted  to  practice  in 
January,  1882,  also  coming  out  first  from  the  examinations,  and  entered  into  partner- 
ship  with    Mr.   Robidoux.      He   married   in    May,    1882,    Miss    Amanda    Fortier, 
daughter  of  Antoine  Fortier,  Esq.,  N.P.,  of  Ste.  Scholastique.     In  1885,  he  removed 
his   residence  to  St.   Rose,  where  he  still   lives,  partly  on   account  of  poor  health. 
Chosen  as  a  candidate  in  1888  to  oppose  Mr.  Leblanc  in  a  bye-election  for  Laval, 
he  was  defeated.  He  met  with  the  same  experience  in  1890  in  the  deneral  Elections. 
By  request,  he  replaced  Mr.  Robidoux  as  Professor  of  Civil  Law  at  McGill  during 
the  Session  of  1888-89  ;  was  appointed  Assistant  Professor  of  Law  in  said  institution, 
and  given  the  Course  of  Professor  Lareau  in  1889-90.     At  the  reorganization  of  the 
Faculty  of  Law,  in  1890,  after  the  munificent  endowment  of  Mr.  McDonald,  he  was 
appointed  Professor  of  Civil  Procedure  and  Municipal  Law,  which  position  he  still 
holds.     He  dissolved  partnership  with  Mr.  Robidoux,  when  the  latter  entered  the 
Provincial  Government  as  Provincial  Secretary,  and  is  now  practising  alone. 

In  the  List  of  our  Biographies  I  don't  think  there  is  one  single  example  which 
should  arrest  the  attention  of  the  youth,,  not  only  of  Montreal,  but  the  Province  at

large,  such  as  llial  of  Thomas  Foriin,  now  one  of  the  Professors  of  Law  in  the 
University  of  McGill.  It  is  a  grand  incentive  to  all  our  young  men  ////  desperandum, 
for  through  every  amount  of  difficulty,  trouble  and  opposition,  if  a  young  man  will 
only  set  himself  in  a  determined  manner  to  succeed,  he  will  in  the  end  accomplish  his 
desire.  A  good,  honest,  religious  and  healthy  life,  moral  and  physical,  will  always 
succeed  in  the  end.  Let  all  remember  the  old  Roman  adage  :  "  Labor  omnia 
vincii." 

RKNi;  AUGL'STE  RICHARD  HUBERT 

Was  the  son  of  Louis  Edward  Hubert,  merchant  of  St.  Denis,  River  Richelieu,  and 
of  Dame  Marie  Cecil  Cartier,  aunt  of  the  late  .Sir  George  E.  Carlicr,  Baronet,  and 
was  born  on  the  5th  of  June,  181 1. 

When  he  had  made  with  distinction  all  the  classes  of  his  course  of  study  in  the 
College  of  St.  Hyacinthe,  at  twenty-five  years  of  age,  he  was  admitted  en  the  i6th 
April,  1836,  to  the  Bar  of  Lower  Canada.  Among  his  classmates  maybe  mentioned 
the  Bishop  of  .St.  Hyacinthe,  Hon.  Judge  Sicotte  and  Pierre  David  Hubert,  ALD., 
his  brotlier.  He  studied  in  the  offices  of  the  late  Louis  Michel  V'iger,  Esq.,  and  in 
that  of  the  well-known  C.  S.  Cherrier,  Esq. 

Choosing  Montreal  for  the  exercise  of  his  profession,  for  the  long  period  of 
thirty  years  he  always  had  a  large  number  of  rich  and  lucrative  clients  as  a  reward 
for  his  assiduity  to  his  profession,  his  talents  and  great  integrity.  No  man  deserved 
a  better  position  than  R.  A.  R.  Hubert.  In  after  years,  his  sterling  qualities  were 
well  known  and  his  honest  purpose  appreciated  by  those  in  power. 

He  married,  on  the  26th  December,  1833,  in  the  Parish  of  Pointe  aux  Trembles, 
Dlle.  Hermine  Viger,  the  daughter  of  the  late  Joseph  Viger,  P^sq.,  and  of  Therese 
Archambault  of  that  place. 

Just  thirty  years  after  his  admission  to  i)ractice  as  an  advocate  he  was  named 
Prothonotary,  nth  January,  1866,  and  occupied  this  important  position  and  difficult 
situation  to  his  death,  to  the  entire  satisfaction  of  the  Bench,  the  Bar  and  the  public. 

A  new  Bank  had  been  established  in  Montreal  and  received  the  name  of 
the  patron  saint  of  Canada,  the  St.  Jean  Baptistc  Bank.  The  subject  of  this  sketch 
was  the  Provisional  President  of  the  new  enterprise. 

A  s*ale  which  Mr,  Hubert  made  at  Cote  St.  Paul,  near  Montreal,  showed  the 
advance  of  proi)erty  iu  this  city  at  that  time.  The  farm  consisted  of  ninety-six  arpents 
extent,  and  cost  the  small  s\mi  of  $4,800  in  the  year  1866,  and  was  sold  to  a  company 
of  capitalists  for  the  fabulous  price  of  $280,000. 

Let  us  now  go  back  to  1837.     ^  J'^^^  ^f*^^''  '^'^  admission  to  the  Bar  he  was 
engaged  in  the  troubles  of  that  year,  and  was  present  on  the  14th  December  at  the 
battle  of  St.  Eustache  with  the  late  Dr.  Chenier,  slain  in  the  fight ;  J.  H.  Peltier,  Esq. 
advocate,  then  his  co-partner  ;  J.  Chevalier  de  Lorimier,  who  was  one  of  the  victims 
of  the  troubles  of  1838.     St.  Eustache  is  pleasantly  situated  on  the  north  branch

of  the  Ottawa  river  or  tlie  Riviere  du  ChGnc.  Tlie  malcontents  were  strongly 
entrenched  in  the  church  which  was  set  on  fire,  as  was  also  the  presbytcre  and 
about  sixty  of  the  principal  houses  in  the  village.  Nearly  200  fell  victims  to 
their  folly  from  the  fire  and  charges  of  the  troops,  or  they  were  suffocated  in 
the  rtanies  of  the  buildings  destroyed.  Mr.  Hubert  was  exposed  to  the  fire  of 
the  32nd  Regiment  and  a  battalion  of  volunteers  on  the  north  side  when  he  was 
riding  on  horseback  on  the  south  side  of  the  Petite  Riviere  du  ChGne,  having 
had  a  ball  pass  through  his  hat,  and  he  would  certainly  have  been  killed,  exj)Osed  as 
he  was  to  the  fire  of  more  than  800  guns,  if  the  balls  had  been  better  directed,  but 
for  the  most  part  tiiey  lodged  in  the  sides  of  the  houses  opposite  to  the  Royal  Regiment. 
On  the  6th  January,  1838,  he  was  taken  prisoner  with  his  brother,  Fran&lt;;ois  Xavier 
Hubert,  N.P.,  of  St.  Denis,  at  St.  Anloine,  River  Richelieu,  and  thrown  into  the 
Montreal  gaol,  where  were  then  confined  the  late  Sheriff  Leblanc,  the  late  Dr. 
Wolfred  Nelson  and  many  others.  He  remained  in  gaol  for  some  months,  till  Lord 
Durham,  converting  his  mission  into  one  of  peace,  on  the  occasion  of  the  coronation 
of  Her  Most  Gracious  Majesty  Queen  Victoria,  caused  the  gaols  of  Canada,  now 
crowded  with  political  offenders,  to  be  emptied — many  being  released  on  giving 
security  for  future  good  behavior.  Mr.  Hubert  gave  recognizances  of  $10,000  that 
he  would  not  "  trouble  the  peace  again  for  five  years."  More  than  fifty  years  have 
passed  since  the  subject  of  this  sketch  gave  these  bonds,  a  new  generation  has  arisen, 
Mr.  Hubert  and  all  his  old  companions  have  passed  away,  but  what  he  and  the 
other  "  Fils  de  la  Liberte  "  fought  and  bled  for,  this  generation  and  their  children 
have  now  obtained,  viz.,  responsible  government  and  the  election  of  ils  members  by 
the  people  themselves. 

Very  few  have  such  an  unblemished  escutcheon  and  genealogical  register  as  Mr. 
Hubert,  and  very  few  can  tell,  especially  in  a  new  country,  of  the  position  and  occu- 
pation of  his  great-great-grandfather. 

CARDINAL   AND   DUQUETTE. 

We  will  give  the  closing  scenes  of  the  life  of  these  two  Patriots,  the  first  of  the  twelve 
who  were  hanged  above  the  gate  of  the  present  Gaol.  All  these  memoirs  are  taken 
from  my  "  Historv  of  the  Montreal  Prison." 

'•  Cardinal  and  Duquette  were  at  the  head  of  the  Patriots  who  went  to  the 
village  of  Caughnawaga  to  possess  themselves  of  the  Indians'  weapons,  when  they 
were  arrested  on  the  4th  November,  and  on  the  28th  with  Lepailleur  condemned  to 
die.  The  last  named  escaped  the  gallows,  and  was  transported  to  Australia,  but 
afterwards  returned  to  Montreal,  where  he  died  not  long  ago. 

On  the  20th  December,  from  his  cell  in  the  Montreal  Prison,  Cardinal  wrote, 
amongst  other  things,  these  words  to  his  wife  :  Demain,  a  I'heure  ou  je  t'ecris,  mon 
ame  sera  devant  son  Createur  et  son  Juge.  Je  ne  crains  pas  ce  moment  redoutable. 
Je  suis  muni  de  toutes  les  consolations  de  la  religion.     Oh  Dieu,  ayezpitie  de  moi,  de

ma  femnie  ct  de  mcs  enfanls,  je  voiis  Ics  rccomniancle,  veilicz  sur  eiix,  servez  leur 
d't'poiix  ct  de  peie,  et  ne  tardcz  pas  de  les  leunir  tons  avcc  moi  dans  voire  saint 
paradis.'  And  yet  such  is  tlie  height  to  whicli  party  feeHng  will  he  carried  during 
times  like  those  of  which  we  are  now  writing  that  The  Montreal  Jferaid,  of  dale 
November  19th,  1838,  thus  says:  *  We  have  just  seen  the  new  gallows  made  by  ^^^. 
Bronsdon,  and  we  believe  that  it  is  to  be  set  up  facing  the  prison,  so  that  the 
incarcerated  rebels  may  enjoy  a  sight  that  doubtless  will  not  fail  to  assure  to  ihem 
sound  sleep  and  agreeable  dreams  I  Six  or  seven  of  them  can  be  strung  up  at  once, 
without  difficulty  on  the  new  gibbet,  but  a  yet  greater  number  at  a  pinch  would  it 
accommodate.' 

Great  efforts  were  made  to  save  Cardinal,  and  his  wife  sent  a  most  touching  letter 
to  f-ady  Colborne.  It  was  of  no  avail.  The  last  scene  of  bidding  adieu  between  him 
and  his  family  was  heart-rending  as  the  Historian  of  this  period,  .Mr.  L.  ().  David, 
justly  says  in  his  late  interesting  work  from  wliich  the  Author  here  acknowledges  to 
have  gained,  as  from  former  works  of  his,  a  great  deal  of  information  :  '  Quand  I'heure 
fatale  de  la  separation  sonna  d  I'horloge  de  la  prison,  quand  ils  se  donnerent  dans  un 
long  sanglot  le  baiser  de  I'^lernel  adieu,  ils  etaient  plus  morts  que  vivants.' 

At  last  the  fatal  day  arrived.  It  was  a  gloomy,  cold,  cheerless  morning.  The 
sun  was  as  it  were  ashamed  to  shine ;  massive  clouds  iloated  like  funeral  trappings 
all  over  Montreal.  Nine  o'clock  arrived.  The  procession  wended  its  way  from  the 
condemned  cell  on  to  the  scaffold.  The  friends  of  the  prisoners  and  others  recited 
the  Deprofnndis.  One  great  cry  arose  from  the  assembled  thousands  round  the 
walls  and  gate.     The  trap  fell  and  Cardinal  was  launched  into  eternity. 

Joseph  Duquette  had  a  more  tragic  end.  He  was  quite  a  boy,  not  yet  twenty- 
one  years  of  age.  Everything  i)Ossible  was  done  to  mitigate  his  sentence.  Even  the 
Indians  of  Caughnawaga,  regretting  their  haste  arresting  Cardinal  and  Duquette,  sent 
a  beautiful  petition  to  Sir  John  Colborne,  but  in  vain,  he  suffered  the  same  day  as 
Cardinal.  One  of  those  horrible  spectacles  sometimes  seen  at  executions  happened 
to  him.  The  cord  was  badly  adjusted  round  his  throat  and  became  disarranged. 
They  saw  the  body  of  the  unfortunate  young  man  swinging  from  right  to  left  and 
strike  violently  the  wood  work  of  the  scaffold.  Some  one  called  out  '  pardon, 
pardon,'  but  this  was  of  no  use.  The  executioner  hardly  knowing  what  to  do, 
seizing  the  cord,  brought  back  the  body  upoji  the  scaffold  and  at  last  all  was  over. 

On  the  2cth  December,  1838,  L.  E.  Drummond,  afterwards  the  well-known 
Judge  Drummond,  sent  a  most  pathetic  letter  to  His  Excellency  Sir  John  Colborne, 
to  arrest  the  execution  of  Cardinal  and  Duquette,  stating  therein  that  they  had  been 
illegally  condemned,  and  proving  the  facts  by  declaring  their  actions  during  the 
uprising.  Besides  the  last  named  was  not  a  major  in  the  eye  of  the  law,  as  Duquette 
was  not  twenty-one  years  of  age.  But  all  seems  to  have  been  in  vain  as  they  both 
suffered  execution."

ROHEKT,  HAMKLIN,    DKCOKINK,  A.  SANGUINET  AND  CHARLES  SANGUINET. 

"  The  prisoners  Robert,  Hamclin  ;iiid  tlio  two  Sanguincts  were  accused  of  having 
taken  part  in  tlie  expedition  against  La  Tortue  and  the  deatii  of  the  unfortunate 
Walker,  and  for  this  they  suffered  death.  On  tlie  iSth  January,  these  four  with 
Decoigne,  alscj  condemned  to  suffer  deatli,  marched  willi  steady  tread  from  their  cells 
to  the  scaffold,  wiiere  they  were  hanged  in  a  row. 

J.  J.  Robert  was  the  leader  of  a  band  of  insurgents  who,  on  the  3rd  November, 
endeavored  to  disarm  the  Loyalists  at  St.  Philippe,  St.  Constant  and  Laprairie,  and 
had  besieged  the  house  of  Mr.  Walker.  He  was  a  farmer  of  St.  l'hili])pe.  His 
j)Osition  and  character  and  age  were  sufficient  to  make  him  a  leader  among  the 
])alriots  of  his  parish.  He  had  long  been  an  admirer  of  I'apineau,  and  was  one  of  the 
first  who  had  remitted  to  the  Authorities  his  Commission  as  a  Captain  of  Militia. 
On  the  morning  of  his  execution  he  consoled  his  companions  in  the  condemned  cell, 
and  prayed  both  for  them  and  for  his  country.  Efforts  was  made  for  a  res|)iie  of  his 
sentence  by  his  friends  on  account  of  his  age,  but  in  vain. 

F.  X.  Hamelin  was  a  Lieutenant  in  the  company  of  which  Robert  was  Captain. 
He  had  taken  an  active  part  in  the  attack  of  Mr.  Walker's  house,  when  Walker  was 
killed.  Hamelin  was  quite  a  boy,  not  more  than  eighteen  years  of  age,  and  as  in  the 
case  of  Duquette,  strenuous  efforts  were  made  to  save  him  on  account  of  his  youth, 
but  all  in  vain.  Frightened  at  first  with  the  fear  of  death,  he  afterwards  maintained  a 
calm  demeanor  during  all  the  fearful  preparations,  and  having  received  the  last  rites 
of  the  Church,  and  [)itiei  by  everyone,  he  bravely  died,  as  he  firmly  believed,  in  the 
discharge  of  his  duty  and  for  his  country. 

The  two  Sanguinets  were  brotliers,  and  belonged  to  one  of  the  oldest  and 
most  respectable  families  in  the  country.  Their  father  was  the  proprietor  of  the 
Seigniory  of  Lasalle  in  the  County  of  Laprairie.  The  father  lost  all  by  law.  The 
sous  had  been  active  ever  against  the  Crovernment,  and  by  their  energy,  the  unfor- 
tunate Cardinal  had  been  returned  as  Member  for  their  County.  ]ioth  were  married 
now  and  highly  esteemed  by  their  fellow  citizens.  The  one  was  called  Ambrose,  and 
was  thirty-eight  years  old  when  he  suffered;  the  other,  Charles,  was  thirty-six.  They 
were  both  in  the  company  of  Robert,  one  as  Captain,  the  other  as  Lieutenant. 

Decoigne  was  a  notary  of  Napierville,  married,  and  twenty  four  years  of  age. 
He  was  condemned  on  account  of  being  one  of  the  chiefs  in  the  camp  of  the  Patriots 
at  Napierville.  Expecting  to  escape,  as  the  proof  against  him  was  feeble,  he  received 
the  news  on  the  12th  January  to  prepare  to  die  on  the  i8th  with  calm  resignation,  and 
on  that  day  he  expired  as  the  others,  fortified  by  the  rites  of  his  Church,  and  the  feel- 
ing that  what  he  had  done  was  for  his  country."

NARHONNK,  NlCUl-AS,  DAUNALS,  inNI)i:LAN(i   ANO   UkI.OUIMIEK. 

"  At  their  execution,  I5tli  l''el)riiary,  18,59,  another  of  those  disgusting  spectacles  hap- 
pened as  in  the  case  of  poor  Duipiette.  When  the  rope  was  placed  round  the  throat 
of  Narhonne,  and  the  execution  about  to  take  place,  on  account  of  one  of  his  arms 
having  nearly  been  cut  off  when  a  child,  and  the  executioner  having  neglected 
sufficiently  to  secure  the  other,  the  poor  soul,  when  the  trap  fell  (his  arms  becoming 
loose)  seized  the  cord  and  suspended  himself  both  by  his  mainitd  and  whole  arms. 
Twice  they  had  to  let  go  their  hold  and  twice  Narbonne  seized  the  cord.  At  last 
after  this  bungling  and  sad  spectacle,  death  kindly  came  and  terminated  his 
sufferings. 

At  the  same  time  was  executed  a  Quebecer  n  mud  Nicolas.  After  the  battle 
of  Odellown,  he  was  taken  prisoner,  when  he  had  wanderetl  nearly  half-starved  and 
frozen,  into  a  miserable  cottage,  and  sent  under  a  strong  escort  to  the  (laol  of 
Montreal.  Having  been  condemned,  he  was  executed  witli  the  otiier  four  on  the  15th 
February,  1839. 

On  the  iSth  Janu.iry,  when  he  arrived  at  the  prison  of  Montreal,  he  passed 
under  the  gallows  wiiere  a  few  hours  before  the  five  unfortunates  and  his  friends, 
Decoigne,  Robert,  the  two  Sanguinets  and  Hamelin  had  been  executed.  One  of  the 
guards  tiien  said  to  him  :  '  Look  at  the  roi)es,  one  of  them  is  wailing  for  you.' 
Nicolas  quickly  replied:  'I  will  die  as  I  have  lived,  a  Patriot.'  Only  eight  iiours 
elapsed  from  the  arrest  of  Nicolas  till  he  was  court-martialed  and  condemned  to 
death.  He,  on  the  15th  February,  mounted  witli  his  com|)anions  tiie  steps  of  the 
scaffold  with  a  fum  tread,  and  when  on  the  platform  spoke  to  tlie  crowd,  the  substance 
of  which  has  been  much  debated  about  ever  since.  Some  say  he  expressed  regret  at 
the  part  he  had  taken  in  the  rebellion,  whilst  others  say,  according  to  all  trustworthy 
accounts  his  last  words  were  the  following: — 'Je  ne  regrette  qu'une  chose,  c'est  de 
mourir  avant  d'avoir  vu  mon  pays  libre  ;  mais  la  Providence  finira  par  en  avoir  pitie, 
car  il  n'y  a  pas  un  pays  plus  mal  gouverne  dans  le  monde.' 

Daunais  was  only  twenty  years  of  ag.',  and  in  the  last  hours  of  his  life  was  calm 
and  silent,  and  endured  without  a  murmur,  and  died  without  a  struggle. 

Charles  Hindelang  was  the  only  Protestant  among  the  twelve  who  suffered 
death,  during  these  times,  by  execution  at  theMontreal  Gaol.  He  was  not  a  French 
Canadian,  but  came  from  Paris.  Originally  Swiss,  and  for  a  long  time  residing  in  the 
Capital  of  France.  After  the  affair  of  Odeltown,  Hindelang  was  taken  prisoner  and 
thrown  into  the  Montreal  Oao",  and  on  the  24lh  January  condemned  to  be  hanged, 
but  he  was  not  executed  for  three  weeks  afterwards,  as  he  was  one  of  the  five  hanged 
15th  February, 

We  find,  the  evening  before  their  execution,  the  five  prisoners  obtained  permis- 
sion to  give  a  banquet  to  their  other  unfortunate  compatriots  confined  in  the  Gaol, 
Hardly  any  one  ate  much,  for  their  hearts  were  overcharged  with  sorrow,  and  it  was, 
indeed,  a  sad  and  melancholy  scene.    After  supper,  DeLorimier  said  these  words  :— 


290 


GAZETTEER    OE    MONTREAL. 


'  Ma  palric,  puissc  l-ellc  ne  jariiais  oublier  que  nous  sonimcs  morts  pour  elle  sur 
I'dchafaiid  !  Nous  avons  vecu  en  palriotes  et  nous  mourrons  en  patriotes  !  A  bas 
les  tyrans  !     l,eur  legne  acheve.' 

Hindelang  also  spoke,  and  in  the  course  of  an  eloquent  harangue  lie  burst  out 
and  said : — '  Oli,  France,  cherie,  tu  as  regu  mon  premier  soupir  ;  ton  fils  cpii  va 
motirir  deniain  sur  une  terre  etrangere  t'ainie  toujours.'  On  the  morning  of  the  15th 
February,  as  he  was  busy  writing  what  he  would  say  on  the  scaffold,  at  eight  o'clock 
the  officials  entered  his  cell  and  told  him  that  the  hour  had  come  for  his  execution. 
'Oui,'  replied  he,  'je  suis  pret,  accomplissez  votre  oeuvre  infame.'  When  he  left 
his  cell,  he  saw  his  friend  DeLoriniier,  who  called  to  him  : — '  Courage,  my  friend, 
the  end  draws  near,' — when  Hindelang  replied  : — '  Death  is  nothing  for  a  French- 
man.' 

The  prisoners  then  bade  adieu  to  all  their  comrades  and  companions,  and  with 
firm  steps  marched  on  to  the  scaffold.  DeLorimier  leading  the  double  band, 
followed  immediately  after  by  Hindelang,  then  Nicolas  and  Narbonne,  and  last  the 
youthful  Daunais. 

A  great  crowd  lined  all  the  streets  and  avenues  leading  to  the  Gaol.  Whilst  very 
many  wept,  others  positively  laughed  at  the  awful  spectacle. 

Arrived  on  the  scaffold,  when  all  was  ready,  Hindelang  addressed  the  crowd  in 
these  words  : — '  Sur  cet  echafaud,  eleve  par  des  mains  anglaises,  je  declare  que  je 
meurs  avec  la  conviction  d'avoir  renipli  mon  devoir.  La  sentence  qui  m'a  coii- 
damne  est  injuste,  mais  je  pardonne  volontiers  a  ceux  qui  I'ont  rendue.  La  cav.se 
pour  laquelle  je  meurs  est  noble  et  grande,  j'en  suis  fier  et  ne  crains  pas  de  mourir. 
Le  sang  verse  pour  elle  sera  rachete  par  le  sang.  Puissent  les  coupables  en  porter 
la  responsabilite  !  Canadiens  en  vous  disant  adieu,  je  vous  16gue  la  devise  de  la 
France  :  "  Vive  la  liberie  !  "  ' 

Having  pronoimced  these  words  with  a  loud  and  firm  voice,  he  was  launched 
into  eternity.  His  body,  it  is  believed  was  buried  in  the  Military  Burying  Ground  on 
the  Papineau  road.  Hindelang  was  escorted  to  the  scaffold  by  the  late  Rev.  John 
Bethune,  D.D.,  his  spiritual  adviser,  who  remained  till  the  last. 

DeLorimier  was  the  last  of  the  five  executed  this  day.  He  was  a  native  of 
Montreal,  his  fiimily  a  noble  one,  and  one  that  remained  in  Canada  when  it  became 
a  British  Province.  After  Napierville,  he  w^as  arrested  and  brouglit  to  the  ^'^ontreal 
Gaol  on  foot,  where  he  was  tried  by  Court  Martial,  and  condemned  to  be  hanged. 
This  sentence  was  carried  out  on  the  fatal  15th  February.  When  he  was  about  to 
go  to  the  scaffold,  he  gave  Prieur  a  lock  of  his  hair,  that  was  contained  in  a  leWer, 
which  rtad  thus  : 

Prison  de  Montreal,  15  F6vrier  1839. 
Cher  Prieur, 

Vous  me  demandez  un  mot  pour  souvenir.  Cher  ami,  que  voulez-vous  que  je 
vous  ecrive,  je  pars  pour  I'echafaud.  Soyez  courageux,  et  je  meurs  votre  ami. 
Adieu. 

Chevalier  DeLorimier.

At  a  qiiaitcr  lo  nine  o'clock,  DcLorimior  parted  with  Hiiid-lang,  in  the 
presence  of  the  gaoler,  military  officers  and  several  soldiers,  he  saying  to  the  execu- 
tioner :  *  1  am  ready.'  He  mounted  the  scaffold  with  a  firm  step,  and  when  Hinde- 
lang  had  finished  his  address  with  the  words  •  Vive  la  liberte,'  he  nodded  his  head, 
in  approval  of  the  sentiments,  and  almost  immediately  after,  the  sign  was  given,  and 
the  trap  fell,  and  the  five  unfortunates  were  launched  into  eternity. 

A  letter  written  to  his  wife,  at  seven  o'clock  of  the  morning  of  the  day  of  his 
execution  was  found  on  his  heart,  after  he  was  cut  down,  full  of  love  and  heroic 
sentiments,  the  last  paragraph  of  which  is  given  as  a  sample  of  the  whole  : — "  Sois 
done  heureuse,  ma  chere  et  pauvre  femnie,  ainsi  que  mes  chers  i)etits  enfants,  c'est 
le  vceu  le  [jIus  ardent  de  mon  ame.  Adieu  ma  tendre  femme,  encore  une  fois  adieu  ; 
vis  et  sois  heureuse. 

Ton  malheureux  mari, 

Chevalier  DeLorimier. 

I  cannot  close  this  imperfect  sketch  of  the  last  sufferer  on  tiie  scaffold  for  1837- 
38  with.out  just  stating  that,  within  the  past  year  or  two,  Colbornc  avenue,  next  the 
Gaol,  has  had  its  name  changed  to  DeLorimier  avenue,  after  the  Chevalier  DeLorimier. 
Sir  John  Colborne  is  often  spoken  about,  especially  at  .St.  Kustache,  after  the  disas- 
trous engagement;  perhaps  our  fellow  French  citizens  had  this  in  view  when  they 
changed  the  name  of  the  avenue. 

A  beautiful  monument  has  been  erected  in  the  Roman  Catnoli'^  Cemetery  of 
Cote  des  Neiges  to  Mieir  memory,  and  to  the  lasting  praise  of  our  French  Roman 
Catholic  fellow  countrymen,  Hindelang's  name  is  as  conspicuous  (although  a  Swiss 
and  a  Protestant)  as  any  of  the  others.  On  the  four  sides  of  the  splendid  column's 
pedestal  are  engraved  mementoes  of  this  melancholy  epoch,  recording  also  the  names 
of  C.  O.  Terrault,  who  figured  then,  an  Advocate  and  Member  of  Parliament,  and  J. 
O,  Chenier,  a  Physician,  who  fell  at  St.  Eustache. 

The  oration  on  the  occasion  of  the  inauguration  of  the  monument  was  pronounced 
by  the  late  worthy  Chief  Justice,  Sir  (then  the  Honorable)  A.  A.  Dorion,  and 
speeches  were  also  delivered  by  AL-.  Wilfred  Dorion  and  ALr.  Hector  Fabre.  Thus 
rest  till  the  Great  Day  of  final  judgment  these  twelve  Patriots  of  1837-3S.  Let  the 
prayer  be  softly  said  over  them,  Rcquiescat  in  Face,  and  let  us  all  ever  bear  in  mind 
the  saying  of  one  of  ihe  eaiinent  Latin  writers,  Horace,  '  Diilcc  est  &gt;ri  pro 
putrid.' 

I  will  close  with  an  account  of  what  took  place  exactly  forty-four  years  after 
DeLorimier  had  written  those  beautiful  words  in  his  last  letter  to  his  wife,  the  night 
before  he  was  hanged,  and  when  he  penned  :  '  O  mes  com[)atriotes,  je  vous  confie 
mes  enfants.  Je  meurs  pour  la  cause  de  mon  pays,  de  votre  pays,  ne  souffrez  &lt;.  a\c 
pas  que  ceux  que  je  suis  oblige  de  quitter  souffrent  de  la  pauvrete  apres  ma  mort, ' 

And  how.  though  tardily,  this  was  done  was  seen  wh.cn  an  article  appeared  in 
1883,  in  La  Tribune,  of  Montreal,  making  public  that  the  widow  and  two  daughters 


292  GAZETTEER    OK    MONTREAL. 

of  DeLoiimier  were  living  in  poverty  and  want  at  the  beautiful  village  of  L'Assomp- 
tion,  about  twenty-four  miles  from  Montreal,  The  effect  was  electrical,  and  stirred 
u])  the  heart  of  the  French  community  to  the  very  core,  and  under  the  presidency  of 
Mr.  L.  O.  David,  Mr.  I^ouis  Frechette,  the  poet,  being  vice-president,  and  the  late 
Mayor  H.  Beaugrand,  as  secretary,  subscriptions  were  soon  raised,  and  a  trip 
taken  to  the  village,  where  an  address  and  a  large  purse  of  money  were  given  to 
Madame  DeLorimier,  Among  the  chief  promoters,  besides  the  above  three  gentle- 
men, were  MM.  Archambault,  Saint-Pierre,  Deseve,  Madame  Saint-Pierre  and  Mile. 
Peltier." 

SKETCHES  OF  CANADIAN  PATRIOTS. 

I  WILL  give,  on  the  side  of  the  Constitutionalists,  a  series  of  short  sketches  as  they 
appeared  in  'The  United  Service  Journal '  of  1838.  Among  the  sketches  from  this 
writer  of  1838,  it  will  be  seen  that  he  speaks  most  kindly  of  several  of  the  Patriots, 
but  makes  an  egregious  blunder  in  causing  Dr.  Wolfred  Nelson  to  die  in  the  Mon- 
treal Gaol.     The  article  is  given  as  originally  printed  : — 

"  Louis  Joseph  Papineau  is  the  son  of  Joseph  Papineau,  a  Notary  in  Montreal, 
v.'ho  is  still  living,  although  ninety  years  of  age.  He  has  ever  been  denominated  by 
the  Canadians  as  '  Father  of  the  Patriots,'  but  not  a  patriot  either  in  the  spirit  or 
sense  in  which  it  is  now  applied  to  his  son.  This  aged  individual  has  never  been 
the  enemy  of  Great  Britain,  neither  was  he  opposed  to  the  Government  at  a  period 
when  it  was  generally  believed  by  the  Canadians  to  be  the  intention  of  England  to 
make  innovations  on  the  institutions  and  privileges  guaranteed  to  them  at  the  con- 
(juest  of  the  country.  Vet,  naturally  jealous  and  fearful  of  such  consecjuences,  he 
was  induced  to  take  the  chair  at  a  large  iniblic  meeting  held  on  the  Champ  de  Mars, 
against  the  then  projected  Union  of  the  Upper  and  Lower  Provinces,  at  which  a 
petition  was  voted  to  the  Sovereign,  and  afterwards  signed  by  eighty  thousand 
Canadians,  expatiating  on  the  blessings  they  enjoyed  under  the  Constitution  as  it 
then  stood,  and  still  stands,  and  praying  that  it  might  remain  unaltered. 

Such  was  the  spirit  of  the  aged  parent  of  the  rebel  Papineau.  We  have  I)een 
induced  cursorily  to  mention  him,  merely  to  show  that  the  revolutionary  ojMuions 
of  the  son  were  not  inculcated  from  early  ^youlh,  but  nieiely  the  oulbreakings  of 
a  discontented  mind,  embittered  by  events  and  disasters  of  his  own  seeking.  On 
the  contrary,  we  have  reason  to  believe  that  the  aged  Papineau  earnestly  endeavored 
to  check  the  rebellious  jjrinciples  exhibited  by  the  son  in  all  his  actions  lor  several 
years  past,  being  fully  convinced  that  he  was  guided  and  governed  in  all  his  extra- 
vagant and  rebellious  designs  far  more  from  vanity  and  ambition  than  from  any  con- 
viction that  his  patriotism,  so  called,  could  lead  to  the  welfare  of  his  country,  or  that 
he  had  the  means  or  ability  of  carrying  his  measures  into  effect. 

The  individual  we  have  here  alluded  to  is  about  forty-nine  years  of  age,  and  of 
mild  and  courteous  manners,  which  have  no  similarity  with  his  opinions  or  a[)pear-

ance.  In  height  he  is  al)oiit  five  feet  eight,  and  inclining  to  cmbonpobit.  His 
features,  which  are  prominent,  have  something  of  the  Jewish  cast,  wiiich  is  much  added 
to  by  his  dark  hair  and  eyebrows,  wliich  are  thick  and  arclied,  giving  much  fire  to 
the  eye.  He  is  undoubtedly  a  man  of  much  information,  and  in  society  his  conver- 
sational powers  are  most  fascinating.  It  cannot  but  be  deplored  that  an  individual 
so  gifted  should  be  led  by  motives  of  ambition  to  seek  his  own  ruin,  instead  of 
employing  his  talents  for  the  benefit  of  his  fellow  men. 

The  Commander-in-Chief  of  Louis  Papincau's  rebel  army  is  named  l&gt;ROWX,  who 
appears,  if  we  may  judge  of  his  speedy  abandonment  of  the  fi)rces  undt.M-  his  com- 
mand, to  have  as  much  mistaken  his  calling  as  the  cause  which  has  joined  him  with 
the  great  Canadian  chief.  I'his  individual,  denominated  General  Urown,  is  an 
American,  but  very  unlike  the  American  portion  of  the  .Montreal  community,  who, 
it  is  but  justice  t3  say,  have  always  been  as  true  to  tlie  cause  of  Great  Britain  as  the 
most  loyal  of  her  subjects,  which,  by-the-by,  is  another  argument  to  the  i)rejudice  of 
Mr.  Papineau. 

General  Brown  is  a  miserable  sijualid-looking  person,  of  short  stature  and  con- 
temptible appearance  ;  his  countenance  being  stami)ed  with  an  expression  of  dis- 
content, meanness,  and  indecision  of  character  in  mind — in  fact,  by  his  own  country- 
men he  would  be  termed  a  'crooked  cretur.'  Not  long  before  the  rebellion  he 
became  a  bankrupt  ironmonger,  and  thus  having  nothing  to  lose,  but  everything 
to  gain,  he  placed  himself  at  the  head  of  the  factious  army.  In  this  capacity,  how- 
ever, he  proved  himself  unworthy  the  confidence  of  the  poor  deluded  victims  whom 
he  and  his  leader  Papineau  had  seduced  into  their  service. 

A  character  not  less  conspicuous  is  Doctor  Wolired  Nelsov.  His  person  was 
handsome  and  manly  ;  in  height  about  six  feet  ;  and  his  disposition  was  far  more 
determined,  courageous  and  active  th  i  any  of  his  brother  traitors  ;  and  had  he 
been  well  sui)ported,  he  would  have  proved  a  dangerous  and  powerful  enemy.  This 
individual  was  the  son  of  an  Knglishman  of  high  respectability,  who  formerly  kept  a 
school  at  Sorel.  He  married  early  a  Canadienne,  and  settling  at  St.  Charles,  the  hot- 
bed of  democracy  in  that  section  of  the  country,  and  being  possessed  of  talent,  intel- 
ligence, and  energy,  he  was  sought  out,  fiattered,  and  caressed,  until  at  length  falling 
into  the  snare,  he  became  the  tool  of  the  factious  party,  until,  hurried  on  step  by 
step,  he  fell  a  victim  to  ultra-liberal  oi)iniDns,  and  having  had  leisure  to  brood  over 
his  follies  and  disappointed  ambition  as  an  inmate  of  the  prison  at  Montreal,  died 
within  its  walls,  a  sacrifice  to  the  cowardice  and  ill-advice  of  his  flatterers,  and  his 
own  weakness. 

Doctor  O'Callaghan  may  rank  next  amongst  the  list  of  factious  heroes.  This 
gentleman  is  the  ci-devant  editor  of  Louis  Papineau's  gazette,  mis-termed  '  The 
Irish  Vindicator,'  and  the  coadjutor  of  the  traitor  chief  in  every  thing  that  was  vile 
and  miserable.     He  was  first  known  in  Canada  as  the  apothecary  at  the  Montreal

Hospital,  which  place  he  left  for  Quebec — being  at  that  period  an  Ultra-Tory  in 
every  sense  of  the  word.  Having  persecuted  the  then  Governor,  Lord  Aylmer.  with 
constant  applirations  ibr  lucrative  employment,  without  success,  he  forsook  his  old 
calling.  Dissatisfied  and  inconsistent,  he  offered  himself  as  an  agent  for  Canadian 
agitation,  and  ultimately  succeeded  in  being  appointed  by  Mr.  Papineau  editor  of 
'  The  Irish  Vindicator,'  in  which  situation  he  catered  fully  for  the  seditious  tastes 
of  his  employer.  His  advance  was  afterwards  as  rapid  as  his  fall.  Rewarded  for 
his  democratic  scribbling  by  a  scot  in  Parliament,  he  there  made  himself  conspicuous 
by  taking  a  part  ])rominently  and  diametrically  opposite  to  that  with  which  he  had 
hitherto  sided.  He  then  proceeded  with  his  patron  to  the  action  of  St.  (Jharles, 
from  wb.ence  lie  accompanied  him  to  his  secret  hiding-place  in  the  United  Slates, 
and  neither  the  one  nor  the  other  have  since  been  heard  of. 

Doctor  CoATES,  of  L'Acadie,  another  prominent  rebei,  the  chief  of  that  district, 
is  a  man  of  about  thirty-five  years  of  age,  and  a  member  of  the  Provincial  Parliament. 
He  is,  however,  a  man  of  little  ability,  and  still  less  personal  courage,  strength  of 
mind,  or  fitness  to  head  any  party  whatever  but  is  a  fit  associate  for  those  with  whom 
he  has  connected  himself. 

Another  far  more  talented  individual  is  Mr.  SfiORE  Milne  Bouchette.  He  is 
the  son  of  the  Surveyor-Cieneral,  and  a  young  man  of  not  more  than  twenty-five  years 
of  age,  of  courteous  and  distinguished  manners  and  address,  If  it  may  be  termed  dis- 
tinguishing himself  in  such  a  cause,  he  did  so  ;  for  he  fought  bravely  at  Missisipioi 
Bay,  and  was  taken  after  being  severely  wounded,  and  his  unhappy  fate  may  be  ter- 
minated before  his  career  had  well  begun.  He  is  now  in  the  Prison  of  Montreal, 
and  is  to  be  rcgrettctl  that  one  so  promising  should  have  been  betrayed  into  his 
present  diflficullies  under  promises  of  great  preferment  and  reward. 

GiR(3UARii  is  well  known  from  his  height,  which  is  above  six  feet.  He  is  also  of 
dark  comi)lexion,  with  jet-black  hair  and  eyes.  This  leader  is  by  profession  a  notary, 
and  has  always  been  known  as  a  thorough  Revolutionist  at  heart.  Since  his  discom- 
fiture at  Grand  Brule  he  has  been  taken  by  Mr.  Simpson,  the  Collector  of  Customs 
at  Coteau  du  Lac,  who  is  stepfather  to  Mr.  Roebuck,  although  entirely  differing 
from  him  in  political  opinions. 

M.  Du.MoucHEi,,  of  St.  Benoit,  or  Grand  Brule,  is  also  one  of  the  principal 
promoters  of  the  Rebellion,  which  is  die  more  to  be  regretted  as  he  can  boast  of 
more  than  sixty  years  of  age,  many  of  which  he  has  passed  in  the  bosom  of  his  fiimily, 
and  surrounded  by  the  most  peaceful  peasantry  in  the  world.  He  has  also  been  rich 
in  fortune  and  prosperity,  both  of  which  have  hitherto  been  deserved  as  amassed  by 
his  own  labors  and  honest  exertions.  Alas  I  tJiat  his  overwrought  Republican 
opinions  should,  at  the  close  of  a  long  life,  have  led  him  to  connnit  those  offences 
against  the  law  of  his  country  which  must  terminate  in  his  own  ruin  and  the  sacri. 
fice  of  his  valuable  property.

GiROD,  frequently  confounded  wilh  and  mistaken  for  Girouard,  was  a  Swiss. 
He  went  to  Canada  about  six  years  ago  as  an  adventurer,  thrust  himself  upon  the 
notice  of  the  Government  as  having  imported  into  the  province  a  new  system  of 
agriculture  peculiarly  adapted  to  the  Canadian  farmer,  and  requesting  assistance  to 
carry  his  plan  into  effect  ;  but  not  meeting  with  the  encouragement  he  anticipatedi 
he  conceived  he  might  turn  his  talents  to  more  advantage  by  joining  the  rebels  ;  and 
being  unsuccessful  with  them  at  Grand  Brule,  he  retreated  to  I'ointe  aux  Trembles 
where  he  put  an  end  to  his  republican  s';hemes  and  adventures  by  blowing  out  his 
brains. 

The  IJrilish  settlers  in  this  part  of  the  Montreal  district  had,  from  the  connncucc- 
ment  of  the  revolt,  been  so  persecuted  and  annoyed  by  the  Canadians,  nay,  even 
driven  from  their  homes,  and  that  during  the  most  inclement  season  of  the  year,  diat 
it  is  not  surprising  when  they  found  themselves  in  a  position  to  retaliate,  ihcy  should 
have  inflicted  on  the  inhabitants  of  St.  luistache  and  Grand  "JJrule  that  severe 
degree  of  retributive  vengeance  which  they  experienced  from  the  hands  of  the  loyal- 
ists, but  which  the  Queen's  troops  (to  whom  have  been  falsely  attributed  those  acts 
of  severity)  endeavored,  with  their  wonted  forbearance,  to  prevent.  True  it  is  that 
the  small  force  under  the  orders  of  Colonel  Wetherall,  at  the  battle  of  St.  Charles  on 
the  Chambly  River,  were  directed  by  that  gallant  ofticer  to  follow  up  their  successes 
by  those  decisive  and  rig(jrous  measures  which  dictated  the  necessity  of  destroying 
the  property  of  the  principal  traitors  in  that  quarter  ;  but  when  we  consider  the  very 
critical  situation  of  that  brave  and  little  band,  surrounded  as  they  then  were  by  an 
extensive  disaffected  p()[)ulation  marcliing  upon  them  from  all  sides,  no  alternative 
remained  but  to  employ  sucii  measinx's  as  shoidd  frighten  the  traitors  from  their 
rebellious  purpose,  wh.ich,  to  persons  unacquainted  with  the  true  state  of  that  ])art  of 
the  country,  may  have  api)eared  harsh  and  uncalled  for,  yet,  upon  dispassionate 
retU'clion,  nuist  i)e  deemed  most  merciful  and  salutary,  resulting,  as  they  did,  in  staying 
the  progress  of  the  rebellion,  and  thereby  preventing  that  effusion  of  human  blood 
which  nnist  u'lavoidably  have  ensued  had  the  warfare  been  protracted,  and  the 
deluded  habitants  not  have  retired  to  their  homes  as  they  did,  and  that  very  rapidly, 
on  learning  the  fate  of  their  misguided  compatriots  ;  besides  which,  it  has  been  posi- 
tively ascertained  that,  had  the  expedition  under  Colonel  Wetherall  failed,  the  revo- 
lution would  then  have  been  complete,  as  the  entire  Canadian  people,  flushed  wilh  the 
check  the  troops  under  Colonel  Gore  experienced  from  the  Patriot  foice  at  .St. 
Denis,  were  only  waiting  a  similar  result  at  St.  Charles  to  rise  en  masse. 

There  are  now  ai)Out  270  prisoners  in  the  Montreal  Prison  under  a  charge  of 
high  treason,  among  whom  are  some  persons  of  res[)ectable  standing  in  society,  but 
who  have  long  been  among  the  most  active  partisans  of  the  great  rebel  Papineau, 
and  are  now  implicated  as  concerned  in  the  councils  of  that  plot  which  was  to  destroy 
the  coimection  now  subsisting  between  Canada  and  Great  J3ritain.  The  UKJSt  intUr 
ential  person  of  this  party  is  Mr.  Louis  Michel  Viger,  commonly  called  '  Jieau 
Viger,'  from  possessing  a  very  handsome  and  prepossessing  person  and  mien.      He

is  about  fifty  years  of  age,  a  lawyer  by  profession,  a  nieml.'er  of  the  Provincial  Par- 
liament, and  brother  of  the  Hon.  Denis  V.  Viger,   well  known  at  the  Colonial  Office 
as  a  Canadian  Ambassador,  and  to  be  remembered  by  those  Ministers  whom  he  has 
not  failed  to  fatigue  with  his  favorite  theme  of  Canadian  grievances.      The  said  Mr. 
Louis  Michel  \'iger  was  president  of  a  recently  established  institution  in  Montreal 
styled    '  La   ]}anque   du  Peuple,'     whose   notes   were   peculiarly  stamped  on   blue 
paper,   and  inscribed  in  the  French  language,  for  the   purpose,  as  it  was  stated,  of 
causing  a  ready  circulation  of  money   among  the  habitants,  wh.o,  ))rior  to  the  forma- 
tion  of  this  in^;titution,    refused  ])aper-money  of  any  description.    But  subsequent 
events  have  caused  it  to  be   suspected  that  the  projectors  of  this  bank  had  a  deeper 
scheme  in  view,   as  it  is  now  supposed  to  have    been  originated  for  the  purpose  of 
according  facilities  to  the  rebel  army  ;  and  i\[r.  Louis  Michel  Viger  stands  now  com- 
mitted,  charged  with  having  made  large  advances    and  otherwise  assisted  the  rebel 
cause.     There  is  also  in  company  with  him,  in  the  same  prison,  Mr.  Come  Ciierrier, 
a  lawyer  of  eminence,  and  member  also  of  the  Provincial  Parliament,  a  young  man  of 
promising  abilities,  but  who,   unfortunately   for  himself,   has   employed  them  in  the 
cause  of  sedition  and  rebellion,  for  which  he  is  now  under  confinement.      It  is,  how- 
ever, believed,  thai  he  had  been  betrayed  into  this  error  by  tiie  natural  bias  of  attach- 
ment to  his  lUicle,   Papineau.      But  among  the  extensive  group  of  accused  rebels 
there  is  one,  who  was  arrested  at  Quebec  at   the  commencement  of  the  revolution, 
more  specious,  artful  and  dangerous  than  any  of  them.      This  person,  who  has  con- 
trived to  get  admitted  to  bail,  is  Mr.  Arthur  Norbert  Morin,  the  last  missionary  of 
the  Canadian  faction  to  the  British  Government,  whose  evidence  before  a  committee 
of  the  House  of  Commons  on  Canadian  affairs  has  recently  appeared  in  some  of  the 
leading  public  journals  of  the  Metropolis,  and  who,  prior  to  his  mission,  had  the  dar- 
ing  audacity   to  appear  before  the  Governor  of  Canada,  with   the  other  members  of 
the  House  of  Assembly,  decorated  with  a  tricolor  riband,   which  was  a  clear  indica- 
tion of  the  revolutionary  principles  he  then  entertained,  and  of  his  hostile  feelings 
towards  (ireat  Britain.     Tiie  period  must,  however,  shortly  arrive  when  these  parties 
will  all  be  heard  in  defence  of  the  crimes  for  which  they  stand  accused,   when  they 
will  have  awarded  to  them  that  justice  which  they  severally  merit."

JOSKPll  LOUIS  ARC1IAM15AULT,  (^.C, 


Was  born  at  Varennes,  19th  June,  1849.  ^^'^  father  was  J.  N.  A.  Archambault, 
Notary  Public,  of  \'arL'nnc.s,  who  had  for  yeais  been  a  member  and  president  of  the 
Provincial  Board  of  Notaries,  Quebec.  His  mother.  Dame  Aurelie  Mongeau,  of 
Verch^res,  from  her  ancestors,  is  one  of  the  most  ancient  families  established  in  this 
Province.  He  was  educated  in  the  College  of  St.  Myacinthe,  where  he  obtained 
great  success.  He  was  then  a  student  in  the  law  office  of  Cartier,  Pominville  &amp; 
Jknournay,  in  Montreal,  'look  his  degree  of  B.C.L.  at  McGill  University,  31st 
March,  1871,  and  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  of  Quebec,  nth  July,  1871,  at  twenty-two 
years  of  age.  tie  married  iMnestine,  eldest  daughter  of  the  late  Senator  Rolland, 
of  the  Ellectoiai  Division  of  Mille  Isles. 

Soon  after  his  admission  to  the  Bar  he  went  into  a  partnership  with  the  Hon. 
J.  A.  Chapleau,  now  Minister  of  Customs  in  the  Dominion  Government,  and  the  late 
Hon.  J.  A.Mousseau,  late  Prime  Minister  of  Quebec,  andJ.S.C.  of  this  Province.  At 
the  appointment  of  the  late  Hon.  Mr.  Mousseau  to  the  IJench,  Mr.  Archambault 
formed  a  new  jjartnership  with  the  Hon.  W.  W.  Lynch,  late  Commissioner  of  the 
Crown  Lands  Department,  Quebec,  and  now  a  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court,  and  G. 
H.  Bergeron,  M.P.,  the  present  Deputy  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Commons  of 
Canada,  and  P.  B.  .Nlignault,  advocate,  a  former  student  in  his  office. 

The  career  of  Mr.  Archambault  as  a  legal  member  of  the  Bar  has  been  one 
marked  with  continuous  success  and  great  devotit)n  to  the  interests  of  his  profession. 
From  his  first  start  in  his  profession  he  has  been  entrusted  with  very  important 
cases  in  all  the  Courts  of  this  Province  and  the  Dominion,  and  even  in  the  Privy 
Council  in  England,  whither  he  had  been  twice  called  to  argue  two  important  cases. 
He  was  appointed  a  Q.C.  by  the  Dominion  Government  on  the  18th  February, 
1887,  before  leaving  on  his  second  trip  to  England  for  professional  business  before 
the  Privy  Council.  This  was  a  well-deserved  reward,  and  a  compliment  paid  to  his 
legal  attainments  and  ability.  He  has  always  stood  one  of  the  most  foremost  re/or- 
mators  of  his  profession,  and  interested  himself  in  all  the  good  and  efficient  work  of 
the  legislation  dealing  with  the  Bar  of  the  Province.  He  was  appointed  a  member  of 
the  Council  of  the  Bar  in  1889. 

Mr.  Archambault  has  the  reputation  of  being  fully  versed  in  the  history 
and  literature  of  his  country.  His  contributions  to  the  literature  of  Canada  are 
scattered  in  a  great  many  pamphlets  and  periodicals.  One  of  the  most  important  of 
his  works  is  a  legal  study  on  the  vexed  question  of  the  Laval  University  and  School 
of  Medicine  difficulty. 

Mr.  Archambault  never  entered  into  politics.  A  staunch  Conservative,  he 
always  took  an  active  part  in  the  political  struggles  of  his  party.  At  three  different 
times  when  the  Cartier  Club  was  the  only  political  Conservative  Association  of  the 
Province,  he  has  been  unanimously  appointed  its  President. 

Mr.  Archambault  is  of  very  amiable  disposition.      His  turn  of  mind  and  char- 


agS  (;azettekr  of  Montreal. 

acter  bring  to  him  men  of  all  classes  of  society  and  of  all  political  shades.  He  is 
yet  in  the  prime  of  life,  and  if  circumslances  permit  he  will  be  a  marked  man  in  the 
future,  whether  in  the  ])ursuit  of  a  public  career  or  in  the  higher  ranks  of  his  pro- 
fession. Mr.  Archambault  has  lately  been  appointed  Crown  I'roseculor  for  the  Dis- 
trict of  Montreal. 

WILLIAM  WOr&lt;KMAX. 

Pkrhaps  no  man  deserves  a  public  place  in  our  JUographical  .Sketches  belter  than 
Wm.  Workman.  He  was  one  of  our  most  ])rominenl  citizens  for  the  long  period  of 
nearly  fifty  years.  Mr.  Workman  was  born  near  Belfast,  North  of  Ireland,  and  came 
to  Canada  about  the  year  1829,  previously  having  spent  three  years  of  service  with 
the  Royal  Engineers  on  the  Irish  Survey.  He  was  a  young  promising  man  when 
he  made  his  debut  in  Montreal  as  assistant  editor  of  the  Courant.  His  elder 
brother,  Dr.  IJ.  Workman,  now  of  Toronto,  was  associated  with  him.  Abandoning 
journalism,  he  entered  into  the  large  establishment  of  Frothingham  &amp;  Co.,  where  he 
soon  commanded  so  much  confidence  and  esteem  that,  shortly  after  iiis  entrance,  he 
was  admitted  i)artner,  and  the  name  of  the  firm  was  then  changed  to  what  it  is  still 
styled  to  this  day,  "  Frothingham  &amp;  Workman."  This  firm  has  always  been  the 
largest  establishment  in  the  hardware  business  in  Canada,  and  its  name  is  "  familiar 
as  household  words  "  throughout  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  Dominion,  Hon. 
Senator  Murphy  being  now  the  head  of  the  firm.  Mr.  Workman  retired  from  the 
firm  in  1859,  having  made  an  ample  fortune.  In  1849,  '"-'  ^^'^^  elected  President  of 
the  City  Bank,  and  continued  for  some  years  to  hold  this  responsible  office,  when  he 
resigned.  He  was  the  foimder  of  the  City  and  District  Savings  Bank.  He  was  the 
first  President  of  the  Bank,  and  held  the  office  for  six  consecutive  years.  He  received 
from  the  Bank  officials  a  grand  epergne  and  service  of  solid  silver  i)late.  He  was  a 
Liberal  in  politics,  and  a  strong  su])pjrter  of  the  Lafontaine-Baldwin  party.  Having 
these  views,  Mr.  Workman  was  often  brought  into  close  relations  with  the  French 
Canadians  of  this  party,  and  the  .\uthor  can  personally  testify  to  the  unfailing 
expressions  of  respect  and  esteem  enteriained  by  many  leaders  of  the  Liberal  party 
towards  him.  In  1868,  Mr.  Worktnan  was  elected  to  the  high  and  honorable  position 
of  .Mayor  of  Montreal,  and  for  the  next  two  years  following  he  was  re-elected  by 
acclamation.  During  his  term  of  office  his  house  was  always  open,  as  his  generous 
hospitality  was  always  profusely  dispensed  to  all  strangers  who  visited  Montreal. 
During  the  office  of  Mayoralty,  Mr.  Workman  was  twice  honored  with  a  public 
banquet  in  which  all  classes  of  the  community  joined.  On  the  occasion  of  the  second, 
and  on  his  retirement  from  the  office  of  Mayor,  he  was  presented  as  a  gift  from  the 
citizens  with  a  magnificent  diamond  ring  which  cost  $i,ooo,  and  two  costly  pieces  of 
solid  silver  plate,  accompanied  by  a  most  flattering  address,  signed  on  behalf  of  the 
citizens  and  Corporation  by  a  committee  com[)osed  of  the  most  wealthy  and  influen- 
tial citizens  of  Montreal.  The  fi)llowing  names  of  the  Committee  show  the  esteem 
in  which  .Mr.  Workman  was  held  by  every  shade  of  political  opinion  :  C.  J.  Coursol,

he  landed,  and  was  the  recipient  of  many  tiianks  from  the  Royal  party  during  their 
sojourn  in  this  city.  For  some  years  before  his  death,  Mr.  Workman  had  been 
gradually  retiring  into  private  life.  Death  hadtliinned  his  family,  and  he  felt  that 
during  the  remaining  term  of  his  allotted  career,  having  done  his  duty  to  this,  his 
adopted  country,  he  might  now  retire  from  the  battle  of  life  and  let  the  mantle  of  his 
intelligence,  energy  and  success  fall  u|)on  the  shoulders  of  some  other  rising  men. 
He  died  a  few  years  ago.  His  gifts  to  the  Protestant  poor  of  Montreal  in  the  Work- 
man Wing  of  the  Country  House  of  Refuge  will  never  be  forgotten. 

DR.  BJ.AKE. 

This  name  often  appears  in  the  garrison  and  criminal  records  of  the  City  of  .Montreal. 
Dr.  Charles  Blake  was  a  retired  Army  Surgeon.  He  came  from  Ireland.  .After 
leaving  the  army  he  practised  in  Montreal.  In  one  of  the  first  murder  cases  ever 
recorded,  we  find  his  name  in  the  Judge's  sentence.  This  is  the  first  record  in  the 
annals  of  the  Court  of  King's  Bench  of  a  murder  case  in  Montreal.  The  Judges 
present  were  Hon.  Chief  Justice  Monk,  Mr.  Justice  Panel  and  Mr.  Justice  Davidson. 
It  reads  thus  : — Dominus  Rex  vs.  Ignace  Vaillancourt.  A  jury  of  twelve  French 
Canadians  was  empannelled,  and  the  Attorney-General  opened  the  case  and 
examined  the  witnesses.  After  the  return  of  the  jury  into  Court  by  their  foreman, 
Antoine  Desloriers,  the  prisoner  is  declared  guilty,  and  the  Court  pronounced  the 
following  sentence  :  "  That  the  prisoner  be  taken  from  hence  to  the  Common  Gaol 
of  the  District  from  whence  he  came,  and  from  then:e,  the  day  after  to-morrow,  that 
is  to  say,  on  the  ninth  day  of  March  instant,  to  the  common  place  of  execution,  and 
that  he  then  and  there  be  hanged  by  the  neck  till  he  l)e  dead,  and  that  his  body 
immediately  afterwards  be  delivered  to  Charles  Blake,  Esq.,  of  Monlreal,  Surgeon,  to 
be  dissected  and  anatomized." 

We  again  find  his  name  in  a  petition  to  be  appointed  "  Surgeon  to  the  Garrison 
at  Montreal."  In  1774  or  1775  he  received  the  appointment,  as  we  find  his  name 
recorded  afterwards  as  such.  One  of  his  daughters  married  the  well-known  late 
Judge  Aylwin,  and  his  widow,  in  1814,  married  Major  B.  A.  Panel,  another  well- 
known  name.  He  was  rather  a  prominent  man  in  his  day.  I  find  he  was  appointed 
a  Justice  of  the  Peace  in  1795,  and  was  one  of  a  Commission  of  Doctors  to  report  on 
a  curious  disease  which  had  broken  out  in  1782,  cMed,"  A/a/  A/ig/ois  Lusfacun,  or 
Sibbins.''  This  disease  was  since  widely  known  by  the  name  of  "  St.  Paul  Bay 
Disease."  Dr.  Blake,  like  most  of  his  countrymen,  was  a  ready  wit,  and  it  is  said 
that  he  dictated  this  inscription  to  be  placed  on  his  tomb,  "  The  Last  of  the  Blakes."

STANLEY   (:F,ARK  UACC,,  J.l'. 

IJUKINC,  the  hillLT  pari  of  llir  last  c-ciUury  one  of  llic  niL'inbcrs  of  this  family,  \vlio 
had  married  a  daughter  of  the  oUl  I'aiglisli  Iioiise  of  Stanley,  came  lo  settle  in 
America,  and  was  the  paternal  grandfather  of  the  subject  of  the  present  memoir. 

The  ancient  family  of  Hagg  can  chiim  descent  from  tiie  distinguished  race  of 
Normans,  or  Norsemen,  and  tiie  fust  ancestor  of  whom  any  authentic  record  is  ])vc- 
served  came  over  from  the  icebountl  shores  of  Sweden  in  the  time  of  1  lardicanute, 
about  A.I).  1040,  and  settled  in  England,  where  a  branch  of  the  family  still  exists. 

'J'he  coat  of  arms  of  the  Uagg  family  of  I'lymouth  was  granted  in  1607.  Shield  : 
Paley  and  bendy  of  six  counter-charged  ar.  and  gu.  on  a  chef  or  ;  three  ciiuiue  foils 
az.  Crest  :  a  cinque-foil  az.,  between  two  wings  endorsed  the  dexter  gu.,  the  other 
ar.  The  motto  '■Remember''  is  an  expression  under  which  great  mysteiies  were 
supposed  to  be  c  «ncealed,  it  being  the  last  word  uttered  by  King  Charles,  the  martyr, 
in  1649. 

Stanley  Clark  liagg  was  horn  in  Moutreal,  .V.l).  1S20.  He  received  his  educa- 
tion at  some  of  the  principal  city  academies,  and  at  McCiU  College.  In  1842,  he 
was  admitted  to  the  notarial  profession  ;  but,  after  practising  successfully  for  some 
years,  was  induced  to  relinquish  it,  as  he  wished  to  give  his  personal  supervision  to 
the  management  of  his  estates,  bjing  at  the  time  (after  the  seigneurs  of  Si.  Sul[uce) 
the  largest  landed  proprietor  on  the  island  of  Montreal,  having  inherited  his  exten- 
sive properties  in  that  city,  as  well  as  a  freehold  estate  in  Kngland,  from  his  grand- 
father, the  late  John  Clark.  In  1844,  .Mr.  Bagg  married  the  eldest  daughter  of  the 
late  Robert  Mitcheson,  of  Monteith  House,  Philadelphia,  a  native  of  Durham, 
England. 

As  early  as  the  Rebellion  of  1838,  .Mr.  Bagg's  ever  thorough  loyalty  lo  the 
Crown  was  evinced,  when  he  volunteered  as  iMisign,  and  was  at  St.  Eustache, 
subsequently  rising  in  the  service  to  the  rank  of  a  Captain  of  Cav.ilry. 

He  was  also  an  nonorary  member  of  the  Montreal  Field  JJatlery  of  Artillery  and 
the  Hochelaga  Light  Infantry;  but  in  1859,  by  his  own  request,  was  placed  on  the 
unattached  list  with  a  view  to  future  service  in  the  Active  force. 

He  was  appointed  one  of  Her  Majesty's  Justices  for  Montreal  in  1859,  and  for 
a  time  performed  judicial  duties.  In  January,  1865,  a  large  deputation,  consisting  of 
seven  representatives  from  each  ward  in  the  city,  waited  on  him  to  solicit  his 
acceptance  of  the  position  of  Mayor,  which  he  declined.  He  also  invariably  refused 
to  participate  in  politics,  or  to  accept  a  seat  in  Parliament  ;  but  took  great  interest 
in  the  Benevolent,  Literary,  and  Scientific  Societies  of  Montreal,  having  being  one 
of  the  founders  of  the  Numismatic  and  Antiquarian  Society,  in  which  he  continued 
to  take  great  interest  until  the  time  of  his  death,  and  of  which  he  was  President, 

When  the  publication  of  the  journal  was  first  suggested,  he  entered  most  heartily 
into  the  project,  and  was  unanimously  placed  ujjon  the  editorial  staff;  and  a  more 
pleasant  and  genial  companion  in  editorial  labors  could  not  have  been  selected.

The  local  press  was  largely  iiulebted  lo  Iiis  pen,  and  nianv  of  our  readers  are

not refrain  from  giving  the  titles  of  some  of  iiis  most  able  productions,  which  have  all 
been  warmly  noticed  by  the  press  of  I'jigland  and  Am&lt;M  ic.a  :  i.  '' Notes  on  Coins,''

first  Presidenl  of  the  Knglish  Workingmen's  JJenefit  Soi'iety,  which  has  been  of 
incalculable  value  to  the  families  of  the  hundreds  of  members  who  were  induced  to 
join  through  his  instrumentality  and  patronage.  In  addition  to  the  societies  just 
named,  Mr.  Jiagg  belonged  to  other  literary,  scientific,  national,  religious,  and 
charitable  associations,  being  Life  (jovernor  of  the  Protestant  House  of  Industry 
and  Refuge,  Vice-President  of  the  Montreal  Dispensary,  and  a  Life  Member  of  the 
following  Societies  :  The  Cathedral  Young  Men's  Christian  Association,  the  British 
Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science,  the  Numismatic  Societies  of  London  and 
Philadelphia,  the  Natural  History  Society  of  Montreal,  the  Horticultural  and 
Agriculuiral  Society,  the  Mechanics'  Lislitute,  and  a  (^)rresi)onding  Member  of  the 
Stale  Historical  Society  of  Wisconsin,  U.  S. 

Surrounded  by  all  the  members  of  his  family,  except  his  only  son,  who  was 
absent  in  Juirope,  and  by  clergy  and  friends,  he  died  on  the  &lt;Sth  of  August,  1S73,  at 
his  residence,  l"'airmount  \'illa.  Sherbrooke  Street.  The  funeral  was  attended  by  i 
very  large  number  of  citizens. 

We  are  glad  lo  append  here  what  is  recorded  of  Mr.  IJagg  in  the  '•  Hisloire  de 
la  Lilteralure  Canadienne,"  printed  in  1874  :  "  M.  l&gt;agg  a  rendu,  comme  on  le  voit,

ANDREW  ROBERTSON 

Was  a  Scotchman  by  birth,  having  been  born  in  Paisley,  Scotland,  on  the  i8lh  fune, 
1827.  He  was  the  eldest  and  only  son  (jf  the  late  Alexander  Robertson,  of  Paisley,  by 
his  tirst  wife.  Grant  Stuart  Macdonald.  Mr.  Robertson  received  his  education  at  the 
Paisley  Grammar  School,  going  through  the  usual  curriculum  of  Knglish,  Latin  and 
Greek.  Shortly  after  leaving  school,  like  the  majority  of  Scotch  boys,  he  learned  a 
trade,  that  of  weaving.  He  went,  in  1840,  to  Glasgow  to  push  his  fortune.  Here 
he  served  for  four  years  in  a  dry  goods  store,  and  then  took  a  position  in  a  manufac-

confidence  of  Iiis  employers,  lie  was  four  years  al'lerwards,  in  1848,  admitted  a  partner 
in  the  business.  A  i'cw  years  later  on,  his  liealtii  having  given  way,  he  was  admonished 
by  his  medical  adviser  to  leave  Olasgovv,  and  try  the  efLcts  of  eiilier  the  climate  ^f 
Australia  or  ("anada  on  his  enfeebled  constitution.  He  decided  on  the  latter  country, 
and  along  with  his  wife  and  two  sons  &lt;:ame  to  Montn-al  in  1853.  Shortly  after  his 
arrival  he  went  into  the  dry  goods  business,  and  S(jon  became  one  of  the  leadiig  men 
in  the  trade,  as  senior  partner  in  the  firm  of  Robertsons,  l.inton  iS:  Co.,  of  that  city. 
Business  having  succeeded,  Mi.  Robertscjii  was  enabled  to  retire  from  it  in  1885,  and 
afterwards  enjoyed  other  an;!  p  ■rli  ips  more  c  iii^  ;ni,il  pirsuiis.  l};iiii;  a  public- 
spirited  gentleman,  he  never  shirked  his  iesp&lt;jnsibilities  as  a  citizen,  in  i86Sand 
1869,  he  accepted  the  ])osition  of  ['resident  of  St.  Andrew's  Society  of  Montreal; 
in  1876,  he  was  J'resident  (jf  the  Dominion  JJoard  (jf  i'lade  ;  in  1876  and  1877,  he  was 
President  of  the  Montreal  J}oard  (jf  Trade  ;  was  the  first  I'resi(Jent  of  the  iJominion 
Travtlleis'  .Association;  was  the  President  oi'  the  Royal  CJanadian  insurance 
Ciniipany  since  1876;  and  President  of  the  JJeli 'iV'lephone  ( 'onipany  of  (Janada  since 
its  organization  in  1880.  In  1872,  Mr.  Robeitson  became  one  of  ih  :  (Governors  of 
the  Montreal  (jeneral  Hospital,  and  since  th.it  period  has  filled  the  offices  of 'i'reasurer,

Harbor  ("ommissioners  for  Montreal,  and  he  occupied  tliat  position  to  his  death. 
He  also  took  an  interest  in  military  affairs,  and  in  1861,  during  the  "Trent" 
excilemeiit,  he  was  i'irst  i,ieuteiiant  and  i  ^lai  Leriua^ler  of  the  &gt;  -iilre:..  Light  infantry

jiolitics,  we  think  he  would  rather  act  the  part  (jf  the  Cood  Samaritan  than  indulge  in 
political  discussions,  lie  was  married  on  the  19th  April,  1850,  to  Agnes,  youngest 
daughter  of  the  late  Alexander  Bow,  of  (llasgow,  and  died  a  few  years  ago.

than  Mr.  (jault.  He  was  born  in  a  village  near  .Strabane,  Ireland,  in  iS,^3,  and 
arrived  in  Montreil  when  in  his  boyhood.  There  he  attended  the  High  .School  for 
a  short  while  and  afterwards  was  employed  in  a  wholesale  clothing  house.  In  1S54, 
when  com'paralively  a  young  man,  he  started  in  the  wholesale  dry  goods  business 
in  ])artn(.'rshii)  with  the  late  .Mr.  J.  15.  Stevenson,  imder  the  name  of  (jault,  Steven-

valuable,  he  is  always  the  genial  and  courteous  gentleman,  ready  to  listen  but  (pii(  k

he  w;i,s  sent  to  the  Canadian  Seiiiiniry  of  Xieolet,  near  'I'liree  Rivers.  'I'here  he  was 
Mie  lirsl  to  intro(hi&lt;c  and  keep  up,  in  spite  of  ridicule,  the  current  I'.iriaan  pronuu- 
-KUiou  instead  of  the  anti.piated  l/nns  XIV.  style,  which  still  prevails  m  some  of  the 
I'  reiich  ( '  inadian  (  'ollet^es. 

Ill   .sy.,  he  was  calle.l  to  the  l!ar.      So  -real  had  l,een    iiis   reputation  as  a  Law 
student,  that  in  h.is  first  term  he  wa,s  employed  on  sixty  different   cases.      .Soon    after

in  any  way  departing  from  loyalty  to  tin   Crown. 

Ifc  was,  in  his  day.  ( oiisicKued  th.  best  ciiniinal  lawyer  in  ihe  I'rovimc  of 
(,)iiel)ec.  And  in  one  famous  murder  trial,  it  was  curious  to  n,,te  that  he,  an  Irish- 
man, counsel  for  tl,c  defence,  and  the'  present  [iidKe  john.on.  mnv  Sir  francis  |,,hi,-

eiitranced  with  the  charm  of  iheir  iMvuch  speecjies.  For  S(une  six'een  yc-ars,  en.lin- 
with  iSrn,,  Mr.  Drummond  was  a,  memher  of  the  Canadian  Leirjslative  Asscanl)l\^ 
His  political  adversaries  ^vryc  pleased  to  qualify  his  eloriueiu'e  with  the  epithet' 
"Ihcalncai";  hut  th,w  were  forced  to  own  that  this  perhaps  excessive  !)rilliaiicv 
adorned  depth  uf  ihouyht,  lueadth  of  view,  .^real  powers  of  or;,Miiizaii(,n,  and  perfe.t 
misellishness.  These  latter  (lualilies  were  particularly  shown  in  llu;  way  in  which,  as 
Alt,)ri,ey(;eneral,  he  cariied  the  Seigniorial  'IVnure  liill  against  determined  oppo.si- 
'H-n.  and  in  spite  of  the  fict  that  this  very  ilill,  wjnle  sweepii.n-  :nvay  the  abuses  then 
attaching  to  all  the  Canadian  .U7\//cw,r/rs,  cut  down  the  fortunes  of  his  nearest  and 
dearest  relatives  and  friends. 

At  the  time  wh.u,  so-called  wise  men  seriously  entertained  the  project  (,f  fortify- 
ing a  country  which  is  all  frontier,  he  won  for  himself  the  W'/vyW  of  ■•  no  arinamcni''' 
Drummond,  because  he  had  said  in  the  House  in  his  antithetic  way:  '• 'I'he  hct 
armameni  for  Cana.la  is  no  armament  at  all."  When  aske&lt;l  how  mu.h  pirparatnu, 
he  had  given  to  an  exhaustive  speech  of  several  hours  on  .1,  vital  commeirial  .piestioi&gt;, 
he  answered:   "  Remote  preparation,  eighteen  years;  i^roximate,  half  an  hour."

decision  in  the  •'  l,:imirandc  I'Atradilion  Case"  is  known  to  jurists  who  have  never 
seen  the  banks  of  the  St.  Lawrence. 

Worn  out  by  the  immense  labors  of  his  youth— when  already  in  the  forefront  of 


306  GAZETTEER  OF  MONTREAL. 

his  profession,  lie  looked  so  young  that  strangers  took  him  for  a  mere  bo}' — and  by 
exposure  in  all  weathers  on  the  hustings,  he  spent  the  last  years  of  his  life  in  retire- 
ment in  the  society  of  a  few  kindred  spirits  who  delighted  in  drawing  him  out  on  his 
reminiscences  of  the  Bar  and  of  Parliament.  Like  most  good  talkers,  he  could  give 
you  plenty  of  humorous  and  grave  sayings  of  his  own.  though  he  did  not  fail  keenly 
to  appreciate  wit  and  wisdom  in  others. 

\Vhile  ever  able  to  silence  the  wrongdoer  with  the  keenest  irony  and  satire,  he 
was  the  kindliest  and  most  forgiving  of  men.  He  was  too  open-handed  and  gener- 
ous in  the  management  of  other  people's  affairs  to  take  any  successful  interest  in  his 
own.  Eiit  in  his  closing  years  he  found  especial  interest  in  directing,  as  its  President, 
a  Conference  of  St.  Vincent  de  Paul  almost  exclusively  composed  of  small  trades- 
people and  workmen. 

As  lo  iiis  devotedness  to  Ireland,  Maguire  in  his  Irish  in  America  (p.  90)  tells 
us  how  he  gave  to  Irishmen  in  Montreal  asocial  status  from  which  they  had  been  iij) 
to  his  time  debarred.  Others  might  tell  how  he  helped  to  link  together  in  public  life 
two  interests  which  ought  never  lo  be  parted,  and  which  in  his  private  life  he  had 
knit  indissolubly  into  one — the  interests  of  Irish  and  French  Canadian  Catholics. 
He  was  just  and  merciful  to  liis  fellow  men  ;  we  have  firm  hope  that  he  now  enjoys 
the  reward  of  the  just  from  the  hand  of  our  merciful  God. 

He  died  on  the  20th  November,  1882.  His  son,  the  Rev.  Abb6  Drummond,  is 
at  present  the  esteemed  Rector  of  St.  Mary's  College  (Jesuits),  and  under  his  able 
management  the  affairs  of  that  Institution  will,  no  doubt,  flourish  more  than  they 
have  ever  done.  The  poi trait  of  the  Judge  is  from  an  old  photograph  in  the  Abba's 
possession.

ized a  grand  Kermcssc  in  aid  of  Notre  Dame  Hospital  which  realized  the  handsome 
sum  of  $15,000.    When  the  establishment  of  Laval  University  Branch  in  Montreal  was 
decided  upon,  Dr.  Lachapelle  became  one  of  its  most   ardent  supporters,  and  con- 
tributed much  to  its  accomplishment.     In  journalism,  he  is  favorably  known,  having 
been  the  Editor  raid  Proprietor  of  I' Union  Medicale  from   1876  to  1882.     He  is  a

SIR  FRANCIS  IIINCKS.  C.B. 


Sir  Francis  Hi.vcks  was  ihe  youngest  son  of  the  late  Rev.  Dr.  Hincks,  Professor 
of  Onental  Languages  in  the  Royal  JJelfast  Institution,  and  was  brother  of  the  late 
Rev.  Kd.  Hincks,  D.D.,  rector  of  Ivillylcagh,  who  is  well  known  by  his  writings  on 
subjects  connected  with  Egyptian,  Persian  and  Assyrian  antiquities  and  archajology. 

Sir  Francis  was  born  in  the  ('ity  of  Cork,  14th  Deceml^^r,  1807,  ^^^^^  educated 
at  the  Belfast  Institution.  In  1832,  he  married  Martlia  Anne,  the  daughter  of  Alex. 
Stewart,  Esq.,  of  Ligoniel  near  B^ilf^ist.  He  visited  the  United  States  and  Canada 
in  1830,  and  next  year  commenced  business  in  Toronto.  In  1839,  l"*^  founded  the 
Toronto  Examiner,  which  he  edited  for  several  years.  In  1844,  he  removed  to 
Montreal  and  founded  the  old  well-known  paper  The  Pilot,  and  was  for  many  years 
the  chief  political  writer.  At  the  first  General  Election  after  the  Union  of  the  two 
Canadas,  Sir  Francis  was  returned  for  the  County  of  Oxford,  and  in  next  year  was 
appointed  Insi^ector  General  of  Public  Accounts  in  tlie  l^.Udwin-Lafontaine  Admin- 
istration. From  this  date  he  continued  to  sit  in  the  Assembly  till  1858.  Previous 
to  this  last  date,  from  October,  1851,  to  September,  1854,  in  the  Hincks-Morin 
Administration,  he  was  the  Leader  of  the  Government.  He  visited  Washington  on 
several  occasions  to  confer  with  the  British  Minister  there  on  the  subject  of  commer- 
cial intercourse  between  Canada  and  the  United  States.  He  was  elected  by  Lord 
Elgin  to  accompany  him  as  representative  of  Canada  \vhen  he  negotiated  the  Reci- 
procity Treaty  in  1854.  He  was  also  a  delegate  to  the  Maritime  Provinces  in  1862 
on  the  subject  of  the  Intercolonial  Railway,  and  in  the  same  year  was  a  delegate  to 
the  Imperial  Government  to  urge  the  repeal  of  the  Clergy  Reserve  Act  and  the  grant 
of  a  guarantee  for  the  Intercolonial  Railway,  during  which  visit  he  made  the  pre- 
liminary arrangements  with  Messrs.  Peto,  Brassey,  Betts  and  Jackson,  which  resulted 
in  the  construction  of  the  Grand  Trunk  Railway  by  English  capitalists. 

He  retired  from  office  in  1854,  and  the  next  year  had  the  high  honor  conferred 
on  him  of  being  appointed  by  the  Imperi.il  Government  to  the  (rovernorship  of  the 
Windward  Isles,  West  Indies,  where  he  continued  till  1862,  when  he  again  had  the 
high  honor  of  being  appointed  the  Governor  of  British  (Guinea,  South  America,  where 
he  remained  until  A.l).  1869.  During  his  Governorship  of  those  two  Colonies  of  the 
British  Empire  he  received  many  proofs  of  the  approval  of  the  Home  Authorities, 
among  which  are  these  two  distinctions  :  in  1862  he  was  created  a  Companion  of  the 
Order  of  the  Bath  (civil),  and  in  1869  a  Knight  Commander  of  the  Order  of  St. 
Michael  and  St.  George. 

Visiting  Canada  in  1869,  he  consented  t(j  accept  office  in  the  Rose  Government, 
then  in  power,  and  was  sworn  of  the  Privy  Council  of  Canada  and  appointed 
Minister  of  F'inance  for  the  Dominion,  9th  October,  [869,  which  office  he  continued 
to  hold  till  his  resignation  in  F'^ebruary,  1873. 

On  the  return  of  Sir  Francis  to  Canada  after  a  lapse  of  nearly  fifteen  years  he 
was  hailed  by  all  classes  of  the  people.

It  is  to  be  hoped  llial  Canadian  funiulcrs  will  extend  to  this  native  industry  a 
hearty  support,  and  that  Canadians  generally  will  appreciate  and  aid  the  effort  that 
is  being  made  to  establish  the  cliarcoal  iron  industry  within  their  borders.  When  it 
is  considered  that  almost  seven-eighths  of  the  actual  cost  of  pig  iron  is  spent  in  lai)or. 
the  imi)orlance  of  eslablisjiing  and  fostering  in  Canada  sueh  an  industry  as  the  one 
in  question  will  be  patent  to  everyone. 

Aside  from  the  above  mentioned  enterprises  established  by  the  fiim,  the  DiUM- 
mond-MiCall  Pli'K  J'oUNDRV  Co.  has  lately  been  formed  (under  Dominion  Charter) 
for  the  purpose  of  manufacturing  water  and  gas  pipe.  The  works  are  located  at 
Lachine,  immediately  adjoining  the  Car  Wheel  Foundry,  'i'iie  capacity  of  the  Piiic

HON.  FRANCOIS  GEORGE   UABY, 

PuiSNK  Judge  r)f  the  Court  of  Queen's  Bench,  is  descended  from  one  of  the  oldest 
French  families  on   this  Continent,      its  first  Canadian  representative  was  jaccpies 
baby  dc  Rainville,  an  officer  in  the  celebrated  regiment  of  Caiignan  Sallieies,  who 
first  f^ettlcd  in  what  is  now  the  Province  of  (Quebec  more  than  two  hundred  years  ago. 
Various  descendants   of  the  Seigneur  de    Rainville   liave  figured   conspicuously  in 
Canadian  history,  and   some  of  them  have  rendered  distinguished    services  to  the 
State.      At  the  ])resent  day  the  family  is  creditably  represented  in  every  jjiovince  of 
the   Dominion.     The   paternal    grandfather  of  Judge    T)a!)y  was  the  Hon.    P'ranqrois 
Paby,  an  Executive  and  Legislative  Councillor  and  Adjutant-Cieneral   for   the  Pro- 
vince of  Quebec.     His   father,   the    late   Mr.    J()se])h   Paby,  was  also  a  well  known 
member  of  Parliament,  wl-,u  early  in  life  married   Miss  Caroline   Cuy,  daughter  of 
Hon.  Louis  Guy,  Ring's  Notary,  and  a  Legislative  Councillor  of  the  old  Province  of 
Quebec.     Judge  J?aby  was  born  in  Montreal,  August  26th,  1S34.     After  some  time 
spent  in  St.  Sulpice  College,  where  he  diligently  prosecuted  his  classical  studies,  ATr. 
Baby  finished  his  education  at  the  College  of  Joliette.     Here  he  soon  made  a  name 
for  himself  as  a  student  of  good  attainments,  and  succeeded  in  carrying  off  iheliigher 
prizes  in  the  various  de])artments   of  learning.     At   the   conclusion   of  his    College 
career  he  chose  the  profession  whicli   peculiarly  suited  the  bent  of  his  mind,  and  set 
himself  vigorously  to  the  study  of  the  Law.     When  twenty-three  years  of  age  he  was 
called  to  the  Bar  of  Lower  Canada.     Li  1873,  he  was  created  a  Queen's  Counsel,  an 
honor  which  attested  the  quality  of  his  legal  acquirements.     For  several  years  he  was 
a  clerk  in  the  Civil  Service  of  Canada,   a  position  which  provided  him  with  the  means 
of  gathering  a  vast  amount  of  information  which  has  since  i)roved  most  valuable  to 
him.     For  several  years  he  was  ]\Layor  of  Joliette,  and  is  one  of  the  founders  and 
most  active  members  of  the  Montreal  Antiquarian  and  Numismatic  Society,  and  an 
honorary  member  of  "  L'Listitut  Canadien,"  of  Quebec.     In  July,  1873,  he  married

Marie  Ilclonc  Adelaide  JJcrtlieict,  daughter  of  the  late  Dr.  Berthelei.  His  political 
career  dates  back  from  1867,  when  he  ran  for  the  Commons  for  the  County  of 
joliette,  when  he  was  defeated.  In  i&lt;S72,  however,  he  was  more  successful,  being 
returned  by  acclamation.  He  seconded  the  reply  to  the  address  at  the  second 
session  of  Parliament,  October  27th,  1.S73,  that  famous  short  session,  which  opened 
on  ( )ctober  23rd,  and  rose  from  its  labors  on  November  7lh.  The  address  was 
rejected  in  the  Lower  House,  but  adopted  as  ii  stooil  in  the  Senate.  'I'he  MacDo;;- 
ald  Administration  resigned  without  allowing  the  ([uestion  at  issue  to  come  to  a  vote. 
Mr.  Mackenzie  formed  a  (lovernmcnt,  and  an  appeal  was  made  to  the  country  in 
I1S74.  Mr.  liaby  was  re-elecled  by  his  constituency,  but  was  unseated  on  petiticm 
on  October  2&lt;St!i.  On  December  loth  he  was  again  returned,  and  also  in  1X78,  and 
'HI  his  taking  olhce  as  Minister  of  Inland  Revenue  on  October  26th,  of  the  same  year 
he  was  entertained  at  a  jjublic  banquet  at  Joliette.  He  was  a  ready  and  effective 
debater  and  an  efficient  departmental  officer.  In  iSSo  he  was  raised  to  the  Court 
of  (Queen's  IJeiich,  his  present  ijosition. 

Judge  IJaby  is  well  known  as  President  of  the  Montreal  Historical  Society,  and 
is  foremost  in  many  of  our  Societies,  'i'iie  Author  has  to  thank  him  for  several  inlei- 
esting  points  found  in  this  book.  His  last  public  act  was  as  one  of  the  Royal  Com-

WILLIAM  NOTMAN. 

"  Bv  the  death  of  William  Notman,  which  occurreti  at  his  residence,  557  Shei- 
brooke  street,  Montreal  has  lost  one  of  her  distinguished  citizens.  He  was  born  in 
Paisley,  Scotland,  on  the  8th  of  March,  1.S26,  and  came  to  Montreal  in  1856,  when 
he  went  into  the  dry  goods  business  of  Messrs.  Ogilvy,  Lewis  iS:  Co.  He  had  pre- 
viously been  an  amateur  photogra|)her,  fond  of  the  art,  and  full  of  enthusiasm  for  it. 
Soon  he  determined  to  make  it  his  profession,  and  he  began  in  a  small  way,  his 
modest  gallery  being  at  that  time  but  little  known.  It  was  not  long,  however,  until 
he  had  achieved  great  local  distinction  as  an  artist  in  i)hotograpliy,  and  soon  the 
fame  of  Notman's  photographs  spread  over  Canada,  to  the  United  States,  and  even  to 
Great  Uritain  and  the  Continent.  How  artistically  photographic  pictures  were  grouped 
need  not  be  here  described.  Mr.  Notman  was  singularly  modest  and  unobtrusive,  piid 
close  attention  to  his  business,  but  was  well  informed  in  the  events  of  the  day,  and 
quick  to  note  their  trend.  He  had  a  good  deal  of  the  thoughtful  deliberation  of  the 
Scotsman,  without  reaching  the  point  known  as  '  canny,'  and  was  always  cheerful 
in  conversation.  In  his  opinions  he  was  decided,  and  even  tenacious,  but  only  after 
he  had  thoughtfully  considered  matters.  Like  many  Paisley  men,  he  put  fair  play 
uppermost.  Attention  to  business  was  his  ruling  characteristic.  He  refused  to  lake 
rest,  insisting  upon  going  to  his  establishment,  even  after  the  cold,  which  fastened,  as 
it  proved,  fatally  upon  him,  had  progressed  considerably."

a  most  pleasant  feature  of  our  city.  While  deeply  engaged  in  his  own  business,  Mr. 
Notman  was  public  spirited,  too,  and  was  a  Ieadin&lt;:  factor  in  building  the  Windsor 
Hotel.  He  was  a  member  of  the  first  Windsor  Syndicate.  He  was  also  active  in 
securing  the  city  an  Art  Gallery,  wliich  profitted  from  his  efforts.  To  say  that  Mr. 
Notman  was  highly  resj)ected  is  not  necessary  in  tiiis  community,  'j'hose  acquainted 
with  him  cannot  but  feel  that  his  death  is  the  loss  to  our  city  of  a  man  great  in  his 
professi(/n.  He  leaves  three  sons  and  two  daughters,  one  of  the  latter  being  Mrs.

SIR  \YM.   LOGAN, 

TiiK  subject  of  our  sketch  is  cue  of  the  very  few  who  in  this  Bigc.raphicai, 
Gazetteer  are  recorded  as  being  born  in  Montreal.  The  Mayor,  Arclibishop  Fabre, 
Hon.  'J'hos.  White,  the  late  Sheriff  Leblanc,  Strachan  Jlcthune,  ist  Baron  of  Lon- 
Liiieuil.  etc.,  aic  some  of  those  who  can  be  counted  as  true  Montrealers. 

Sir  William  was  born  20th  Ai)ril,  1798.  His  grandi)arents  came  fr&gt;)m  Stirling, 
Scotland.  They  came  to  Montreal,  about  the  year  1784,  with  their  only  two  children, 
AVilliam  and  Hail.  Here  he  carried  on  his  busines.s  as  a  baker,  flourished  and 
bought  large  tracts  of  land  in  the  neighborhood  of  tlie  city,  and  afierwards  we  find 
him  settled  down  at  what  is  now  called  ''Logan's  Farm.'"  In  1794,  Janet  Edward, 
his  niece,  arrived  from  Stirling,  and  married  her  cousin  \\'il'iain,  who  had  succeeded 
his  father  in  the  l)usiiiess.  'I'hey  had  nine  childrei.,  Mr  William  beini;  the  third 
eldest.  His  laihei'  sent  him  to  the  celebrated  school  of  Dr.  Skakel.  Afterwards  lu' 
was  sent  to  the  Hi^u  Scliool  of  Edinburgh,  and  then  for  a  vear  to  the  Universitv.  At 
eighteen  he  went  to  I-ondon,  thence  to  Canada,  where  he  was  impressed  with  his  first 
geological  ideas.  Afterwards  he  went  to  Swansea,  in  Wales,  in  1839,  to  be  the 
Manager  of  the  Copper  Smelting  Works,  in  which  his  uncle  was  interested.  l"'or 
seven  years  he  thus  continued  working  at  the  copper  and  coal  mines,  and  studying 
every  jihase  ol  their  formation.  In  1841,  he  visited  the  coal  fields  of  Pennsylvania  and 
Nova  Scotia  in  connection  with  the  Geological  Society  of  London.  Soon  after  this 
he  was  appointed  head  of  the  Survey  in  Canada.  In  1851,  he  had  charge  of  the 
Canadian  Collection,  and  was  well  received.  He  was  also  Canadian  Commissioner  at 
the  Paris  Exposition  in  1853,  and  was  created  Knight  of  the  Legion  of  Honor. 
Next  year  he  was  Knighted  by  the  Queen,  and  al?o  received  the  Wollaston  Palladium 
Medal  for  his  ])re-eminent  services  in  Geology.  He  received  the  honorary  degree  of 
D.C.L.  fiom  Lennowille  in  1855,  and  LL.D.  in  1856  from  McGill.  He  had  also 
F.R.S.('..  given  to  him  in  1851,  and  R.S.E.  in  1861.  He  was  also  a  member  of  many 
of  the  highest  and  most  important  societies,  both  in  Europe  and  America.  He  died 
July  22nd,  1875,  in  Wales,  and  was  buried  in  the  churchyard  of  Llechryd  in  that 
principality.     Sir  William  never  married.

IIOLT.IS  SHOREY,  J.  V. 


Thk  subject  of  this  skclcli  was  born  at  IJarnston,  Eastern  Townships,  Province  of 
Quebec,  on  liie  2nd  December,  1823.  His  fiither  was  Samuel  1^.  Shorey,  of  J'lngHsli 
descent  and  a  native  of  the  United  States,  and  his  motlicr  was  Fanny  Jones,  of  Three 
Rivers.  His  father  had  come  to  Canada  at  eight  years  of  age.  He  was  educated 
at  Halley  Academy,  especially  in  a  commercial  course,  which  has  been  abundantly 
shown  in  the  success  of  his  after  Hfe.  At  sixteen  he  began  the  world  as  an  appren- 
tice, but  when  about  twenty  years  of  age,  his  father  died  and  the  responsibility 
of  a  large  family  of  brothers  and  sisters,  eight  in  all,  fell  entirely  on  his  young 
shoulders.  He  began  business  for  himself  in  Barnston,  where  he  remained  for  over 
twenty  years.  He  came  to  Montreal  in  18G1,  and  was  at  first  connected  with  the 
firm  of  Wm.  Stephen  &amp;  Co.,  at  the  time  when  the  present  Lord  Mount  Stephen  was 
one  of  the  i)artners.  For  six  years  he  was  one  of  the  most  successful  traveHers,  his 
field  of  operation  being  chiefly  throughout  the  Eastern  Townships  districts,  in  which 
he  made  friends  who  continue  to  this  day.  At  last  getting  tired  of  this  travelling  he 
determined  to  begin  business  for  himself.  In  i866,  he  laid  the  foundation  of  one  of 
the  largest  wholesale  clotliing  establishments  in  tiie  Dominion.  After  two  years  he 
took  as  partner  his  son-in-law,  E.  \.  Small,  to  assist  him.  After  a  long  partnership 
of  eigliteen  years,  it  was  dissolved,  and  Mr.  Shorey  then  associated  in  his  business 
liis  two  sons,  S.  O.  Shorey  and  C.  L.  Shurey,  who  now  attend  entirely  to  tlie  duties 
of  the  establishment. 

Mr.  Shorey  was  for  over  eighteen  years  a  member  of  the  Council  of  the  Board 
of  Trade.  He  was  Chairman  of  the  Citizen's  Committee  during  the  small-pox 
epidemic,  and  did  splendid  work  to  alleviate  the  sufferings  of  the  afflicted  and  remove 
t!ie  causes  which  produced  the  disease.  He  was  elected  an  Alderman  for  the  St. 
Antoine  AVard  in  1890,  and  has  been  Acting  Mayor  during  his  incumbency.  He  is 
President  of  the  Montreal  Improvement  Association  ;  is  Vice-President  of  the  Sani- 
tary Association,  and  also  a  member  of  the  Civic  Board  of  Health.  He  is  a  (iovernor 
of  the  Ceneral  Hospital  and  also  of  llie  Women's  Hospital,  a  Director  of  the  Dis- 
pensary, and  also  a  Director  of  the  Society  for  the  Prevention  of  Cruelly  to 
Animals.       He  was  made  a  Justice  of  the  Peace  in  1887. 

He  married,  in  1844,  Miss  Fanny  Wheeler,  of  Barnston,  who  died  in  1S50.  In 
1 85 1,  he  married  Miss  Clara  Gilson,  of  Vermont,  U.S.  He  has  two  sons  and  two 
daughters.  Tiiey  are  all  grown  up  to  man's  estate  and  married,  and  he  has  no  less 
than  fifteen  grandchildren.  Mr.  Shorey  exemplifies,  that  a  man  with  determination 
and  energy  is  sure  to  succeed,  that  "just  and  righteous  dealing  "  will  always  bring 
ts  own  reward,  and  that  a  sober  and  industrious  youth  will  always  result  in  a  luippy

ture system  for  five  years  to  Wm.  i^Iarch,  (Chemist  and  Apothecary,  Newark. 

He  established  his  business  in  Montreal  in  1S59.  The  specialties  of  Mr.  (liay's 
business  are  the  supplying  of  public  institutions  and  physicians  with  drugs,  chemicals 
and  i)harmacenlical  preparations  and  the  dispensing  of  physicians'  i)rescriptions. 

Mr.  Gray  has  devoted  himself  during  the  last  twenty  years  to  the  study  of  .Sani- 
tary Science,  and  jjarticularly  to  the  sanitation  of  cities,  and  has  been  connected 
with  every  movement  to  improve  the  sanitary  condition  of  Montreal.  Mr.  (rr;iy  was 
one  of  the  originators  of  the  Pharmaceutical  Association  of  the  Province,  and  alter 
being  successively  Secretary,  Treasurer  and  ^'ice-President,  was  elected  for  tiirce 
years  in  succession  President  and  member  of  th.e  Poard  of  Examiners.  He  was 
also  one  of  the  Charter  Members  of  the  Montreal  College  of  Pharmacy,  and  for  two 
years  its  President.  In  1884,  Mr.  Gray  was  elected  Alderman  for  the  St.  Lawrence 
Ward.  Shortly  after  his  election  Mr.  Gray  was  elected  unanimously  by  the  City 
Council,  Chaiimaii  of  the  Local  IJoard  of  Health,  serving  in  that  very  difficult  capa- 
city during  the  whole  of  the  clisaslroufi  epidemic  of  small-pox  which  overrun  the  City 
and  Province  in  1S85-86. 

In  1885,  Mr.  Gray  succeeded  in  getting  a  by-law  through  the  City  Council  re- 
quiring the  contents  of  closets  and  all  household  refuse  to  be  cremated,  and  sliortly 
afterwards  crematories  were  erected  and  a  contract  for  five  years'  collection  and 
cremation  given  out.  After  having  served  his  term  as  .Aklerrnan  I'or  three  vears, 
Mr.  Gray  declined  re-election.  Shortly  afterwards  he  was  appointed  by  the  Govern- 
ment a  Justice  of  the  Peace,  and  member  of  the  Council  of  Public  Instruction  for 
the  Province  of  Quebec. 

When  the  "  Public  Health  Act  "  passed  the  Legislature  shortly  after  the  small- 
pox epidemic,  Mr.  Gray,  who  had  in  addition  to  his  aldermanic  duties  been  a  mem- 
ber of  the  old  Central  Poard  of  Health  for  the  Province,  was  api)ointed  a  member 
of  the  new  Public  Health  Poard  then  created,  and  has  remained  a  member  ever 
since,  having  been  reappointed  by  the  (iovernment  of  Mr.  NFercier  at  the  expiration 
of  his  first  term  of  service. 

In  1885,  Mr.  Gray  was  elected  "  membre  honoraire  de  la  Societe  d'Hygiene 
Francaise,"  of  Paris,  France.  We  may  add  that  shortly  after  his  retirement  from  the 
City  Council,  Mr.  Gray  was  asked  by  a  number  of  leading  citizens  of  all  parties  and 
creeds  to  accept  the  nomination  of  Mayor,  but  owing  to  business  reasons  he 
was  obliged  to  decline.

Was  born  in  Londf^n,  England,  Marcli,  1825.  In  tlie  year  1832  lie  came  to  Canada 
wilji  his  parents.  His  father  was  a  mechanical  engineer.  Edward  was  the  eldest  of 
the  family,  and  commenced  early  to  work  for  himself,  his  first  situation  being  with 
Joseph  Mackay,  then  doing  Inisiness  in  the  I'lace  D'Armes  ;  he  next  engaged  with 
\V.  Ccmmell,  clothier,  where  he  remained  for  some  time.  He  next  removed  to 
Springfield.  Massachusetts,  where  he  started  business  for  himself  which  he  continued 
for  two  years,  but  at  the  end  of  that  time,  finding  it  not  as  profitable  as  he  wished, 
he  returned  to  Montreal,  where  he  entered  into  a  i)artnership  willi  his  old  employer 
Mr.  (iemmell.  which  was  dissolved  some  lime  afterwards,  and  he  then  commenced 
business  in  his  own  name  in  McClill  street.  In  1853,  he  bought  the  property  near 
the  corner  of  Si.  I'cter  and  St.  Paul  streets,  then  known  as  the  J'Achange  Coffee 
House,  where  he  erected  two  large  warehouses,  one  of  which  he  occupied  as  a 
wholesale  clothing  house.  In  the  fall  of  1859  he  went  to  England  to  make  his  usual 
purchases,  returning  along  with  his  wife,  who  had  accompanied  him  on  the  trip,  in 
S.S.  •'  Hungarian  "  of  the  .Mian  Line.  This  ill-fated  steamer  was  wrecked  off  Cape 
Sahle.  Xova  Scoiia,  on  the  moining  of  the  jolh  i''ebruary,  i860,  when  every  soul 
(numbering  over  400)  found  a  watery  giave.  Jiy  his  many  sterling  (juaiities,  com- 
bined with  strict  attention  to  business,  he  was  enabled  to  accumulate  a  handsome 
competency  with  which  he  was  always  ready  to  assist  those  in  distress,  and  many 
were  beU'jfitted  by  his  liberality.

Court,  then  in  McCiill  street,  and  afterwards  in  the  new  premises  in  S'.  Henry 
street.  He  liad  by  strict  attention  to  business  rapidly  acquired  a  fortune  ;  energetic  in 
his  business  habits,  his  real  estate  operations  placed  him  among  the  largest  of  the 
landed  i)ro])rietors  of  the  Island  ot"  Montreal. 

Mr.  Evans'  last  real  estate  operation  was  the  ptirchase  of  the  magnificent  prop- 
erty iii  Diuchester  street  west,  and  known  by  the  name  of  Rose  Pre,  and  costing 
the  large  sum  of  $40,000.

of  Hamilton,  and  the  inventor  of  the  •'  Hotel  Register,"  now  ])atented  in  the 
United  States. 

In  1873,  the  English  Insurance  Companies  in  Montreal  entered  into  a  combina- 
tion \o  raise  their  rates  of  premiums,  which  actimi  on  the  part  of  their  offices  caused 
Mr.  Evans,  himself  one  of  the  largest  insurers  in  the  &lt;:ity,  to  suggest  the  idea  of 
starting  a  new  Company  which  might  break  the  combination  and  lower  the  rate  of 
insurance,  hence  the  existence  of  the  Koyal  Canadian  Insurance  (Company  (jf

FiiE  first  ecclesiastics  who  came  to  Canada  \v'cre  four  Recollcls,  htout^'ht  to  (Quebec 
by  (^hamplain,  in  1615.  Tliey  weic,  the  Superior  of  the  Mission,  and  tlic  I'ailiers 
[oseph  le  Caron,  Jean  D'Olheai:,  and  Pacifiiiue  Duplessis.  'J'lirce  others.  Jesuits, 
were  sent  out  in  1625,  I)y  Henry  1).  F-evis,  Duke  of  \'enladour,  and  three  nioie  were 
added  in  the  following  year.  In  1636,  there  were  filieen  Jesuit  Missionaries  in 
Canada.  'I'hose  who  settled  in  (Quebec,  assisted  by  the  (Jueen  of  Franct-,  llu'  l)u(  licss 
of  Aiguillon,  and  other  benevolent  indivii "u.ds,  fcMined  several  establishments  in  that 
city  and  the  neighboring  country  for  iili[,ious  instruction,  the  relief (jf  the  miserable, 
especially  ihe  sick,  and  the  tuition  of  tlie  young. 

jMontreal,  which  was  founded  in  the  year  i642,s(j()n  became  the  scene  of  similar 
operations.  The  chapel,  which  was  a  slight  ami  hasty  structure  of  wood,  wa.^  bv 
degrees  improved  and  enlarged  as  the  wants  of  the  population  reipnred.  and  was  at 
length  succeeded  by  a  more  substantial  erection  of  stone  in  1672.  'I'hissioid  in  what 
is  now  called  the  French  .Sipiare,  o\  I  lace  d'Aniics.  antl  occupied  the  middle  of  \otie 
Dame  Street,  standing  quite  across,  so  as  to  tlivide  it  into  two  nearly  eipial  parts, 
and  requiring  tra\ellers  to  pass  half  round  the  church  to  proceed  from  one  part  to 
the  other.  As  the  inhabitants  increased  in  number,  tlie  church,  even  in  its  enlarged 
state,  became  too  small,  and  the  Church  of  Jionseccnirs  was  erected  for  their  acconmio- 
dation.  The  city  continuing  to  prosper,  especially  after  the  Colony  became  JJiiiish, 
further  accommodation  was  needed;  and  in  the  year  iS2_i,  the  present  magniticent 
church  was  commenced.  On  the  3rd  of  September  the  corner-stone  was  laid  ;  and  it 
was  so  far  completed  as  to  admit  of  being  opened  lor  pid)lic  worship  on  the  15th  of 
July,  1829,  when  high  mass  was  performed  by  tlie  Uishop  t)f  Telmesse,  and  an  oration 
delivered  by  the  Rev.  Mr.  (^)uibler.  The  greater  part  of  the  Canadian  Roman  Catholic 
Clergy  were  present,  and  the  solemnity  was  attended  by  Sir  James  Kempt,  Adminis- 
trator, the  Staff,  Corporation,  and  other  public  bodies,  and  upwards  of  eight  tiiousand 
persons. 

The  edifice  is  a  chaste  specimen  of  the  perpendicular  style  of  (loihic  aachiteclure 
in  the  middle  ages.  'I"he  length  (jf  the  church,  from  east  to  west,  is  264  feet  6  inches, 
and  its  breadth  from  north  to  south,  144  feet  6  inches.  'I'lie  height  of  the  think  is  6t 
feet  from  the  flagging  of  the  terrace  to  the  eaves.  Tliere  are  six  toweis.so  arr.mged 
that  each  Hank  presents  three,  and  the  east  and  west  ends  two  each.  Those  on  the 
princii)al  or  west  front  are  220  feet  high.  The  space  between  the  front  towers 
is  73  feet,  by  120  in  height,  crowned  with  an  embattled  parapet.  The  thinks  and  east 
towers  are  each  115  feet  in  height.  There  are  five  public  and  thiee  private  entrances 
to  the  first  Hoor,  and  four  to  the  galleries,  so  that  an  audience  of  ten  thousand  ])er- 
sons,  the  number  for  whi  '  t  is  seated,  may  assemble  and  disp'T.^o  in  a  few  minutes 
without  disagreeable  pressure.  Hie  tower  contains  the  largest  bell  in  America,  and 
weighs  29,400  lbs. 

The  eastern  window  at  the  high  altar  is  54 feet  in  height,  and  32  in  breadth.     It 
is  separated   by  shafts   into  five  compartments,  and  subdivided  by  muUions  into  36

divisions.  Tiie  windows  in  llie  Hanks  consist  of  one  range,  and  those  in  the  front 
are  finished  in  the  same  style  as  the  eastern  window.  The  i)0rtal  is  formed  l)y  an 
arcade,  consisting  of  tiiree  arches,  eacli  19  feet  by  48  in  height.  From  tliis  arcade 
are  the  cntiaiux-s  to  the  churcli  ;  and  over  it  is  phiced  another  of  tlie  same  form  in 
relief,  which  connects  the  towers  and  jjiers.  ]&gt;etween  these  are  trefoil  canopy-headed 
niches,  intended  for  marble  statues.  It  was  a  part  of  the  original  design  to  have  a 
promenaile  between  the  towers  76  feet  by  20,  elevated  120  feet  above  the  surface  of 
the  Place  d'Armcs,  from  whicli  the  spectatcjr  would  have  a  delightful  and  extensive 
view  of  the  River  Si.  Lvwrence  and  the  surrounding  country.  The  front  towers  were 
intended  to  contain  clcjcks,  and  bells  are  n(nv  placed  in  the  towers,  and  the  view 
from  the  top  is  now  accessible  by  safe  and  easy  tb'ghts  of  steps. 

The  floor,  from  the  front  entrance  to  the  chancel,  is  a  gently  inclined  i)lane  of 
three  feet  in  the  whole  length.  There  arc  seven  spacious  aisles  in  the  same  direction, 
and  two  crossing  them  at  right  angles,  one  of  which  leads  to  the  Hank  doors.  The 
pews  are  raised  six  inches  above  the  aisles.  There  are  seven  cha])els,  so  placed  that 
all  are  seen  fiom  the  front  entrance.  The  high  altar  is  nearly  at  the  extremity  of  the 
nave  :  it  is  elevated  in  the  chancel  2  feet  6  inches  above  the  Hoor  of  the  church,  and 
is  encompassed  on  three  sides  by  semicircular  seats  for  the  clergy,  etc.  The  front 
of  the  chancel  is  open,  and  is  api)roached  by  an  easy  Hight  of  five  steps,  in  the  form 
of  a  double  semi-reverse.  The  eastern  window,  high  altar,  ami  choir,  are  seen  frt)m 
the  front  door  to  great  advantage,  with  a  perspective  view  of  the  side  windows,  altars, 
galleries,  and  the  groined  ceiling,  80  feet  in  height.  The  vaults  of  the  ceiling  and 
galleries  are  supported  in  i)art  by  a  double  range  of  grouped  columns,  3  feet  4  inches 
in  diameter:  from  these  spring  the  groins  of  the  ceiling.  The  pillars  are  of  wood, 
and  jiainted  in  imitation  of  clouded  Italian  or  American  marble.  The  hue  accords 
with  the  ceiling;  but  the  effect,  though  time  may  improve  it,  is  too  glaring,  and  is 
evidently  inferior  to  that  which  stone  pillars  would  have  produced.  The  facings  of 
the  gallery  trusses,  and  the  greatest  portion  of  the  car[)entet's  work,  are  painted  in 
imitation  of  the  oak  finishings  in  the  Gothic  Cathedrals  of  Europe.  The  gallery 
screens  are  in  moveable  pannels,  and  painted  a  crimson  color :  the  railing  in  tVoPt 
of  them  imitates  iron,  and  produces  au  agreeable  effect. 

There  are  recesses  in  the  piers,  between  the  windows  on  the  first  Hoor,  intended 
for  family  monuments,  and  in  the  recesses  of  the  windows  are  placed  the  confessional 
screens.  .Suitable  arrangements  are  made  in  the  interior  for  all  the  monuments  and 
paintings  that  may  be  wanted;  and  at  the  sides  .  f  the  high  altar  are  places  assigned 
for  twelve  large  historical  paintings,  which  will  occupy  an  admirable  light  from  their 
position.  The  organ  is  placed  in  the  upi)er  gallery  over  the  front  entrance  ;  the  floor 
in  tb.is  part  is  elastic,  and  the  organ  projects  six  feet  beyond  the  line  of  galleries. 
The  choir  screen  is  finished  in  recessed  seats  for  the  clergy.  Tlie  pulpit  and  canopy 
are  attached  to  one  of  the  pillars:  the  access  to  it  is  from  the  first  gallery.  It 
resembles  in  form  that  in  the  Gothic  Cathedral  at  Strasburg,  in  Germany;  the  high 
altar  resembles  in  part  that  of  St.  Peter's  at  Rome.  The  eastern  window  was  intended 
to  be  filled  with  stained  glass.

V.    WOLFEKSTAN    THOMAS 

Was  born  on   the  9th  January,   1834,   .it  Moorwenston,  Cornwall,  England.      His 
lather  was  of  the  same  name.     Mr.   Thomas  was  educated  at   King  Edward   I\"s 
School,  Sheiborne,  his  i)arenls   designing  him  for  Holy  Orders.     His  own  ambition 
was   the  army.     Before  either  C(juld  be   rea'ized,  he  came  to  Canada   to  eng.ige  in 
farming,  and  going  to  Rice  J-ake  to  learn  practical  agriculture,  he  fcnnid  the  idea  not 
l)raciicable.     Eailing  to  do  so,  he,  after  some  time,  received  a  situation   in  the  ]5ank 
of  LI'pper  Canada.     After  a  year's  service,  he  wer.t  into  the  Tcjronto  JJranch  of  the 
Jiank  of  Montreal,  and  in  1S65  he  was  appointed  Manager  of  the  London  IJranch. 
After  five  years,  in  1870,  .Sir  1).  L.  Macpherson,  by  the  cordial   recommendations  of 
\'l.  H.  King,  ex-President  of  the  Bank  of  Montreal,   gave   Mr.  Thomas   the  offer  of 
Cashier  of  Molsons  Bank,  Montreal.     He  accepted,    and  since    1870  has   faithfully 
rendered  such  st-rvices  to  the  Institution  that  it  is  now  one  of  the  j)rincipal  JJanking 
Houses  in  the  Dominion.     Among  the  many  phases  of  its  increase  may  be  mentioned 
that  llie  capital  has  been  increased  from  one    to  two  millions  of  dollars,  and  more 
than  fifteen   branch   offices   have   been  established    throughout  (Janada.     There  has 
also    been  a  reserve  of  $675,000   provided,  and    the  business  of  the  J]ank  increased 
sevenfold.       Mr.  Tliomas   is  a    Director  of  the   Canada   Life  Assin-ance  Company. 
He   is  also  Vice-President  of  the  McKay  Institute  for  Deaf  Mutes,  and  connected 
with  tlie  General  Hospital,  the  Mount  Royal  Cemetery  Company,  and   the  Verdiui 
Protestant  Hosi)ilal   for  the  Insane.     In    18S4,  'it;   was   appointed  Chairman  of  the 
Finance  Committee  when   the  British  Association    for  the  Advancement  of  Science 
visited  Montrenl.     He  is  also  a  consistent  son  of  the(.'hurch  of  England,  ever  ready 
by  every  means  to  advance  her  interests  and  claims.      He  married  a  daughter  of  Hon. 
Senator  Goodhue.     Mr.  'J'homas  is  one  of  our  best  known  and  respected  citizens. 

CHARLES  E.  SCHILLER. 

His  father  was  at  the  Battle  of  Chateauguay.  His  grandfather  came  to  this  coimtry 
about  1778  as  Surgeon  to  one  of  the  Hessian  Regiments  serving  in  America.  Charles 
was  born  17th  September,  1819,  at  Riviere  du  Loup  (e//  /iauf).  After  being  educated 
at  Benjamin  Workman's  Academy,  he  entered  the  Court  House  in  1835  ^^  Clerk, 
where  he  remained  for  fifty-two  years,  until  his  death.  He  assisted  at  the  Jalbert 
trial  during  1837-8,  also  at  the  great  trial  of  the  St.  yVlban's  Raiders  in  1S64,  and  that 
of  the  Fenians  in  1866.  He  was  appointed  joint  Clerk  with  Mr.  Carter,  and,  on  the 
latter's  resignation,  became  sole  Clerk,  hi  1880,  Mr.  Brehaut  was  appointed  in  place 
of  Mr.  Carter;  but  he  died  suddenly  in  1882,  and  Mr.  Sicotte  was  named  partner. 
Perhaps  Mr.  Schiller  was  the  man  who  jiossessed  the  largest  amount  of  criminal 
knowledge  of  any  person  in  the  Dominion.  The  only  holiday,  in  fifty  years,  which 
he  ever  took,  was  one  month,  when  he  went  on  a  trip  to  New  Orleans.  ]\Ir.  Schiller 
was  universally  confided  in  by  the  Bench  and  Bar,  and  both  Judges  and  Advocates 
placed  unbounded  confidence  in  his  advice  or  decisions.  He  died  on  the  25th  of 
April,  1887.  He  left  a  brother  and  sister.  His  sister  married  M.  P.  Guy,  the  oldest 
notary  in  Montreal.

University,  and  graduating  in  1859  at  Trinity  ('oUege.  He  was  ordained  Deacon  by 
Bishop  Cronyn  in  April,  i860.  His  lirst  appointment  was  assistant  to  Dr.  Caultield 
of  St.  Thomas,  Ontario.  In  1862,  he  became  Incumbent  at  Port  Dover.  \w  1S65, 
lie  was  elected  Incumbent  of  St.  Luke's,  Montreal.  Five  years  after,  in  1S70,  he

in  the  Diocese  of  Huron  by  the  death  of  Bishop  Cronyn,  the  Dean  was  consecrated 
Bishop  of  that  important  Diocese  in  his  stead.  He  has  continued  ever  since  as  one  of 
the  most  earnest  and  impressive  preachers  of  the  day.  His  usefulness  in  Montreal 
can  never  be  estimated.  It  is  still  seen  when  the  Bishop  pays  the  Metropolis  a  visit 
in  the  crowd  which  tlock  to  hear  their  favorite  preacher  again. 

The  Bishop  has  not  been  a  great  producer  of  books,  but  two  which  he  did  write

HON.  JOHN   MOl.SON. 

He  was  the  son  of  the  original  John  Molson  who  was  the  tirstof  the  name  in  Canada, 
and  whose  wonderful  energy  is  well  noticed  in  the  History  in  the  first  part  of  this 
volume,  in  speaking  of  the  first  steamboat  which  ever  sailed  the  St.  Lnvrencc,  The 
subject  of  this  memoir  was  connected  with  his  father  in  all  his  enterpiises,  first  in  his 
father's  service,  then  for  a  short  time  in  opposition,  when  his  father  gave  him  a  vessel 
to  set  him  up  in  business,  and  afterwards  as  a  partner,  and  we  believe  we  are  correct 
in  saying  that  it  was  not  a  little  owing  to  the  energy  and  enterprise  of  the  son  that 
the  father  added  largely  to  the  iKindsome  competence  of  which  he  died  possessed. 

A  striking  instance  of  the  business  capacity  of  the  son  has  often  been  mentioned. 
'J"he  boat  given  him  by  his  father  was  of  inierior  power  and  speed,  but  the  young  man 
was  not  to  be  outdone.  The  river  was  not  lighted  and  buoyed  as  at  the  present  day 
in  these  closingyears  of  the  19th  century,  and  it  was,  therefore,  deemed  unsafe  to  run 
after  dark.  The  son,  however,  ran  his  boat  all  night,  and  by  working  while  others 
slej)!.  made  the  best  time  with  the  slowest  boat. 

"  At  a  later  ])eriod,  when  railroads  were  introduced,  Mr.  Molson  took  an  active 
l)art  in  their  introduction  into  Canada,  and  was  President  (jf  the  first  railroad  opened 
in  the  Province,  the  Si.  Lawrence  and  Champlain,  of  which  he  continued  a  Director 
until  his  demise.  Nor  was  he  less  active  in  advancing  the  interests  of  our  monetary 
institutions.  He  had  fell  the  want  of  these  in  early  life,  when  he  kept  guard  over  his 
fiither's  strong  box,  and  paid  out  the  Knglish  guineas,  French  crowns,  and  Si)anish 
pieces,  to  his  numerous  workmen.  He  became  a  Director  in  the  Bank  of  Montreal, 
but  retired  to  make  room  for  his  father.  Resuming  his  seat  at  tiie  Board  on  tiie 
retirement  of  his  fathe-  from  the  ])residency,  he  remained  as  a  Director  till  1853,  when, 
in  connection  with  his  brother,  William,  lie  es'.ablished  the  Molsons  Bank,  under  the 
Free  Banking  .Act,  and  which  obtained  a  Charter  in  1854,  when  his  young  brother 
Thomas,  also  became  a  1  irge  shareholder  in  that  institution. 

'•  In  politics,  Mr.  Molson  w:is  highly  conservative ;  and  when  the  Special  Council 
replaced  the  Parliament  in  1837.  he  was  called  to  a  seat  m  it.  He,  however,  never 
desired  to  enter  ])ublic  life.  He  preferred  to  assist  in  carrying  out  those  public 
improvements  which  had  been  set  on  foot  by  himself  and  others,  to  develop  the 
resources,  and  aid  in  the  advancement  of  his  native  country.

As  a  private  ciii/.eii,  Mr.  .Molsoii  was  highly  esteemed.  The  cause  of  education

the  three  brothers,  may  be  specially  mentioned  as  an  instance  of  munit"icence  and 
public  spiiit.  As  a  (Governor  for  many  years  of  the  Montreal  (leneral  Hospital,  from 
the  Presidency  of  which  he  retired  about  a  year  previous  to  his  death,  owing  to  his 
failing  health,  hh  zeal  will  be  long  remembered,  which,  cc)nsidering  the  magnitude  of 
his  business  engagements,  often  surprised  his  coadjutors  in  the  management  of  that 
benevolent  institution.  He  died  at  his  residence.  ISelmont  I  lall,  Montreal,  on  the

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  of  Welsh  parentage,  but  he  was  bjrn  in  the  town  of 
Exeter,  England,  5th  December,  1813.  He  was  educated  at  Ivxeter  Collegi'.  and 
afterwards  at  King's  College,  Eor.don.  He  was  ordained  to  the  Ministry  in  iS^j.and 
immediately  proceeded  to  India  as  a  Missionary  to  the  station  of  M\sore.  where  his 
weTkknown  son,  Edwaid,  in  the  City  of  JUmgalore,  was  l^orn.  Edward  is  well  kn;)wn 
to  literary  fame  as  the  aulluir  of  '■  (jinx's  IJaby."  and  who  was  once  a  member  of  the 
Imperial  Tarliament  for  Dinidee,  Scotland. 

Dr.  Jenkins  remained  about  t'lve  years  m  India  and  then  returned  to  England  in 
enfeebled  healih.  He  afterwards  resided  two  years  in  NFalta,  and  in  1.S47  came  to 
M(jntreal,  and  for  six  years  was  the  jiastor  of  St.  James  .Siieet  Methodist  Chiu-ch.  At 
this  time  he  was  best  known  for  his  lectures  :  '"A  Eroteslant's  Appeal  to  the  Douay 
iiible."  Four  large  editions  of  this  bo(jk  were  published  and  sold  during  the  tnst 
year,  but  ncnvit  is  almost  impossible  to  procure  a  copy. — s/r  transit  '^/oria  Diiiiuii. 

Shortly  after  this,  on  accoimt  of  determined  opposition  to  him  in  relation  to  this 
book,  he  resignetl  and  went  to  Philadel(jhia,  as  Minister  of  the  Pre^^b)  terian  (Jlunch 
of  Calvary,  where  he  remained  for  ten  years.  This  closing  period  brought  the 
Doctor  face  to  face  with  the  War  of  Secession,  and  because  he  would  not  pray  on 
Simday  for  President  Davis  and  his  Cabinet,  he  had  to  resign  in  1.S63.  and  went  to 
Eondon,  England,  where  he  was  for  a  year.  Next  year,  1S64,  he  was  invited  to  St. 
Paul's  Chinch,  Montreal,  which  iie  accejited  and  remained  for  no  less  than  ten  years. 
From  1868,  in  connection  with  the  City,  he  was  (Chairman  f)f  the  Protestant  Board  of 
School  Commissioners.  He  was  made  an  EE.D.  by  McCill  in  1879,  'I'lJ -'^  X'tXi.  in 
1859  by  the  University  of  New  York.  In  1S75,  he  resigned  from  school  work.  He 
was  also  a  inem')er  of  the  I]oard  of  ^[c(iill  University,  and  also  that  of  (Queen's, 
Kingston.  In  1869,  he  was  elected  Moderator  of  the  Synod  of  the  Presbyterian 
Church  of  Canada,  and  in  I1S78  Moderator  of  the  United  Churches.  After  an  event- 
ful and  useful  life  to  his  party,  church  and  belief,  he  died  some  years  ago.

ROr.ERT  CRAIK,  M.D. 
He  is  one  of  those  in  these  sketches  who  were  born  in  Montreal.  He  first  saw  the 
light  in  this  city,  22nd  April,  1829.  His  jiarents  had  come  to  ^fontreal  in  i8i8- 
I'he  well-known  late  John  Bruce  educated  the  Doctor  in  his  younger  years.  After- 
wards he  studied  Medicine  and  graduated  with  fust  honors  from  Mcdill  in  1854.  The 
same  year  he  became  House  Surgeon  to  the  General  Hospital,  resigning  in  i860.  In 
1856,  he  was  Demonstrator  of  Anatomy  in  his  Alma  Maler  until  1861,  when  he 
became  Professor  of  Clinical  Siiigery  to  1866-7.  During  this  Session  he  lectured  on 
Chemistry  for  the  late  Dr.  Sutherland,  and  at  his  death  succeeded  him.  retainmg  this 
Chair  till  1879.  He  then  retired,  and  is  now  luneritus  Professor.  To  show  how  far- 
thinking  the  Doctor  was,  even  in  his  youthful  days  of  practice,  we  may  mention  that 
his  graduation  thesis  was  "On  the  Nature  of  Zymotic  Diseases,"  and  now,  more  than 
a  (piarter  of  a  century  afterwards,  what  he  then  spoke  of  and  shadowed  forth  of  the 
theory  of  germ  disease  has  made  a  deep  impression  on  the  i)ul)lic  mind.  The 
Doctor  has  long  held  a  high  standing  among  his  confreres.  He  is  now  a  great 
agriculturist,  and  has  some  of  the  tinest  horses  in  the  country.  In  1856,  he  married 
Miss  Alice  Symmons,  of  Dublin,  Ireland,  but  she  died  in  1874.     'j'lie  Doctor  has  no 

children. 

HON.  JAMKS  FERRJEK,  Sknator, 

Was  born  in  Scotland.  He  was  educated  in  Fifeshire,  and  went  to  Perth  to  serve 
his  apprenticeship.  In  1821,  he  left  Scotland  for  C'anada.  At  twenty-two  he  com- 
menced business  in  Montreal,  and  by  Scotch  ])rudence  and  shrewdness,  he  soon 
accumulated  a  h.andsome  competency.  When  the  Piai  ;.  of  British  North  America  was 
founded  he  became  a  Director  of  it.  For  six  years  he  was  i'rcsident  of  the  Montreal 
Assurance  Co.  When  the  Rebellion  broke  out  in  1837,  '"^  shouldered  his  musket 
among  the  Constitutionalists,  and  liecame  a  Lieut. -(xjlonel  of  the  Militia.  In  1841, 
he  was  ajjijoiiiled  a  ^lunicipal  Councillor.  When  in  '.844  the  offices  became  elective, 
he  was  returned  Alderman  of  ih.e  East  Ward.  Tiiis  same  year  he  was  elected 
Mayor.  Whilst  Mayor  a  terribly  disastrous  fire  took  place  at  Quebec,  and  Mr- 
Feriier  being  at  the  time  an  eye-witness  of  the  awful  destruction  everywhere  seen&gt; 
waited  at  once  on  the  (lovernor-General,  Lcjrd  Metcalfe,  and  so  interested  him  that  an 
immense  fund  was  raised  for  the  sufferers.  Shoitly  after  this,  Mr.  Ferricr  was  called 
by  royal  mandamus  to  a  seat  in  the  Legislative  Coiuicil.  He  projected  the  Montreal 
and  Lachine  Railway,  and  for  a  number  of  years  was  President  of  the  road.  He 
was  elected  as  one  of  the  Directors  of  the  Grand  Trunk  Railway,  and  for  many 
years  was  the  Chairman  of  this  great  concern  in  Canada.  I  le  was  also  appointed  a 
Governor  of  McGill  University,  as  he  had  been  a  member  of  the  Board  of  the 
Royal  Institution  for  the  Advancement  of  Learning.  He  was  also  a  Member  of  the 
Council  of  the  University  of  Victoria  College,  Cobourg.  He  was  for  years  President 
of  the  Quebec  Temperance  and  Prohibitory  League,  as  well  as  that  of  the  Bible 
Society.  He  was  ajjpointed  a  Senator  of  the  Dominion,  and  was  such  at  the  time  of 
his  death,  which  occurred  some  years  ago  after  a  life  of  wonderful  activity,  benevolence 
and  Christian  sympathy.

duc'j  it  as  the  best  sketch  that  can  be  given  of  the  College: — 

•'  As  this  is  the  princiiial  ]Mil)iic  Institution  of  the  CJanadian  Jesuits,  it  will  not 
be  amiss  to  jxjint  out  with  what  nienu)rics  of  Canada,  and  of  Montreal  in  i)ailicular, 
it  is  linked  in  the  past.  The  Society  of  Jesus,  founded  and  defniitely  organized  by 
.St.  Ignatius  of  Loyola,  in  1540,  had.  feu-  more  than  half  a  century,  been  sendin.;  mis- 
sionaries into  every  part  of  the  habitable  world.  As  fast  as  new  lands  were  discovered 
in  America,  they  were  evangeli/ecl  by  missionaries  of  the  Society.  l!ra/il.  IVru, 
I'lorida,  Mexico,  in  fact  nearly  the  entire  Southern  portion  nf  the  New  World,  had 
received  its  apostles;  the  Northern  portion,  and  Canada  in  particular,  were  )iow  to 
receive  theirs.  In  161 1,  Fatheis  Jiiard  and  Masse  accompanied  to  Acadia  tlu'  fn&gt;t 
settlers  of  New  France.  In  1625.  their  followers,  bi'ing  re(piested  by  the  RecoUet 
Fathers  of  New  I'"rance  to  share  their  hard  l.ibors.  landed  at  the  foot  of  liie  ihi-n  lo:  ely 
rock  of  Cham[)lain  ;  ten  years  later,  in  1635,  diey  laid  the  foundations  of  the  College 
of  Quebec,  destined  to  be  foi  many  years  the  training  school  of  Canadian  youth  in 
science  and  virtue.  In  the  previous  year  (1634),  a  residence  was  established  by 
I'ather  LejcuVie  in  the  incipient  city  cjf  Three  Rivers.  The  birth  of  .Monlreal  did  m  t 
come  till  1642;  nevertheless,  as  early  as  1626.  Father  de  Hrebeiif,  on  his  Inst  jtjuniey 
to  the  land  of  the  Hurons,  had,  as  it  were,  selected  the  site  of  the  future  city  ;  in  his 
second  journey  (1635),  he  pointed  it  out  as  the  extreme  limit  of  the  navigation  of  the 
Si.  Lawrence,  and  consetjuently  as  a  spot  of  great  importance.  In  the  same  and 
subsequent  years,  l''ather  Lejeune  concerted  with  the  Companv  of  tlie  Hundred 
Associates  a  settlement  at  this  identical  place,  '  which  may,'  he  sa\s,  •  become  some 
day  a  large  city.'  In  1637,  in  coniixiii)'  with  the  (ioveriior.  he  came  thereon  an 
exploring  expedition.  I''inally,  cm  the  iSth  of  May,  1642.  l'"ather  Iiarthol(ji::ew 
Vimont,  in  the  name  of  the  New  Society  of  Our  Lady,  recently  organized  in  Paris 
by  the  zealous  and  venera'ole  Mr.  (^lier,  said  the  first  Mass  and  invoked  upon  the 
foundations  of  the  future  City  of  \'iHe-M.irie,  or  Montreal,  the  choicest  blessings  (^'i 
Heaven.  During  the  fifteen  years  following,  or  until  the  arrival  of  tiie  Reverend 
Sulpician  I'riests  in  1657,  the  Jesuit  Fathers  were  sole  pastors  of  Montreal;  but.  as 
soon  as  the  spiritual  care  of  the  settlers  could  be  entrusted  to  devoted  hands,  th.ey 
resumed  their  favorite  occupation,  the  preaching  of  the  Cospel  to  the  destitute  Indians. 
Towards  the  end  of  this  periotl,  in  the  spring  of  1657,  Feather  LeMoyne  blessed  the 
corner-stone  of  the  ancient  sanctuaiy  of  Notre  Dame  dc  j^onsecours  (Our  L;uly  of 
Good  Help),  in  1663,  whilst  conveying  to  the  distressed  settlers  a  cargo  of  pr(;- 
visions,  Father  Chaumonot  founded,  in  com])any  with  Rev,  Mr.  Souart,  Sulpician 
Priest,  the  Confraternity  of  the  Holy  F'amily,  which  is  still  in  a  prosperous  condiiitui. 
In  1692,  when  the  wants  of  Montreal  were  on  the  increase,  and  the  very  existence 
of  the  Colony  was  threatened  by  the  incursions  of  the  fndians,  the  Jesuit  Fathers 
returned  and  built  within  its  walls  a  house  and  chapel.      In  the  same  year  they  estab-

day  abundant  fruits  of  salvation.  Their  i)r(&gt;i)erty,  includiiiij;  cha|iel,  convent  and 
garden,  covered  nearly  all  the  ground  now  occujiied  by  the  Chanii)  de  Mars  (drilling 
ground),  the  Court  House  anil  the  new  City  Hall.  At  a  later  period  a  church  was 
adiled  and  rebuilt  on  a  larger  scale  in  1742.  'I'iie  church  faced  the  street  which  now 
forms  tiie  eastern  side  of  Jactiues  Carliei  Scpiare.  In  that  ground,  then  held  sacred, 
lie  the  ashes  of  many  dauntless  missionaries,  who  watered  with  their  sweat  and  blood 
the  seed  of  the  (lospel.  After  toiling  for  a  century  and  a  half  previous  to  the  year 
i77,V  the  members  of  the  su])pressed  Society  of  Jesus,  then  resident  in  Canada,  were 
gradually  gathered  to  their  fathers.  I'ather  Well,  the  last  survivor  in  Montreal,  died 
in  1791,  and  Father  Cazot,  the  last  in  Quebec,  in  i860,  at  tiie  very  time  when,  by  a 
special  providence.  Cod  was  preserving  the  remnants  of  the  Society  of  Jesus  in  the 
\(jith  of  JMirope,  by  providing  them  with  a  shelter  in  Russia,  where,  screened  from 
the  reV(jlutionary  storm  wluch  swe|)t  over  the  Continent,  they  jiatiently  bided  the 
coming  of  better  times.  During  the  lifetime  of  the  Fathers,  the  Fnglish  Government 
allowed  them  the  administration  of  the  i)roperly  belonging  to  their  communities; 
hut  after  their  death,  in  (.lefiance  of  rights  and  protestations,  the  Crown  uncere- 
moniously annexed  everything  to  itself.  The  most  remaikable  of  the  Jesuit  F'athers

jiast  and  at  the  beginning  of  the  present  century  had  partially  i)assed  away,  the 
Socii'ty  of  Jesus  emerged  from  its  temporary  ecHpse,  and  resumed  with  unabated 
vigor  its  mis&gt;&gt;ionary  career.  Those  countries  which  most  retpiired  assistance  were, 
of  course,  first  attended  to;  Canada  was  not  actually  in  want  of  spiritual  laborers, 
but  she  retained  a  kind  remembrance  of  her  early  apostles  and  was  leady  to  give 
them  a  joyous  welcome  ;  in  the  interval  succeeding  their  de])arture,  the  resources  of 
the  coimtry  liad  greatly  developed  and  its  spiritual  necessities  had  increased  with  its 
natural  progress.  Accordingly,  in  1839,  after  an  absence  of  nearly  forty  years,  the 
Society  ajjpeared  once  more  on  the  banks  of  the  great  St.  Lawrence. 

'•  Father  Chazelle,  President  of  St  Mary's  College,  Kentucky,  was  requested  by

own  mansion;  ihey  remained  there  till  1S51.  In  i&lt;S47,  typhus  fever  and  cholera 
made  yreat  havoc  among  the  Irish  immigrants  arriving  in  Canada  ;  the  local  clergy, 
nc;irly  exhausted  by  the  incessant  demands  of  the  sick,  were  aided  in  their  charitable 
work  by  six  Jesuii  I'alhers  who  h.istenetl  from  New  N'ork  for  that  purpose.  It  had 
long  bi;en  fell  that  the  Catholic  educational  institutions  of  .Montreal  were  inerfuieiit 
for  the  growing  importance  of  the  city  and  province  :  Kr.glish  literature  had  not 
received  the  attention  due  to  it,  especially  since,  in  1840,  the  city  had  become  the 
capital  of  United  Canada.  .Sensible  of  this  deficiency,  the  citizens  of  Montreal 
earnestly  entreated  the  Fathers  to  open  a  college  where  liie  Kiiglish  language  sIkjuUI 
be  taught,  and  the  pupils  receive  instruciion  in  commercial  affairs,  as  well  as  in 
JMeiich  and  the  classics.  On  the  isl  of  November,  1S45,  a  public  meeting  of 
influential  citizens,  presided  over  by  IJishop  Bourget.  was  held  to  secure  the  imme- 
diate establishment  of  the  intended  college.  Enthusiasm  ran  high,  but  the  times 
were  unpropitious  ;  great  fires  at  Quebec,  and  an  impending  financial  crisis,  caused 
postponement  of  the  undertaking.  The  present  building  was  commenced  in  1847, 
and  was  suthciently  advanced  to  allow  of  occupation  in  April,  1851  ;  a  school  had, 
however,  been  opened,  20tli  September,  184S,  in  a  frame  house  still  extant  at  the 
iiorliieasl  corner  of  Dorchester  and  St.  Alexander  streets.  Its  progress  is  encourag- 
ing ;  during  the  first  year  the  students  numbered  65  ;  in  1850,  they  were  124;  in 
iS6o,  they  had  increased  to  249  ;  in  1870,  to  336  ;  in  1S91,  to  487.  The  plan  of  the 
college  was  designed  and  jjartly  cairied  out  by  the  first  Rector,  the  Rev.  Father  Felix 
Martin,  a  man  of  rare  administrative  ability,  who  combined  an  almost  stern  s|&gt;irii  ot 
dis(ii)line  with  extraordinary  versatility  of  talent  and  great  kindness  of  heart.  The 
riglit  wing  was  finished  for  occupation  in  1855,  but  the  front,  facing  the  boys'  play 
ground,  is  still  without  its  intended  portico  and  colonnade.  Th&gt;j  entire  structure  is 
built  of  free  stone;  it  is  225  feet  long,  and  on  an  average  30  feet  in  width  i)y  60  in 
height.  The  building  is  provided  with  two  ingenious  fire  escapes,  one  of  which  is 
seen  in  the  view  from  Bleury  street.  They  are  invented  and  patented  by  Father 
Jones,  the  archivist  of  the  (!!ollege.  The  Provincial  Parliament,  after  adding  to  its 
programme  a  course  of  legal  studies,  incorporated  the  college  by  statute,  under  the 
title  of  'St.  Mary,'  in  the  year  1852. 

"  The  Curriculum,  in  which  religious  instruction  holds  the  first  place,  embraces  all 
the  branches  of  a  complete  classical  course,  followed  by  two  years  of  Philosophy,  at 
the  end  of  which  Laval  University  degrees  are  conferred  upon  the  graduates.  Con- 
nected with  the  College  are  preparatory  classes  for  younger  students  who  are  not 
ready  to  begin  their  classical  studies,  and  also  an  elementary  course  for  little  lads,  wlio

lor  the  purity  of  its  i''.nglish  speech.     This   is  no  doubt  owing  to  the  care  which  has 
alw.iys  been  beuowed  by  its  well-'^vd  professors  upon  the  elocutionary  effoits  of  the

GEORG1-:  BRUSH. 

This  well-known  figurehead  of  Montreal  was  horn  at  Vergennes^  State  of  Veruujiit, 
6th  January,  1793.  His  father  was  KIkanah  ]&gt;rush,  and  his  mother  Alulhea 
(Frink)  IJrush.  When  quite  a  young  man  he  lutned  his  attention  to  steamboat  and 
shi|)  br.i  ding.  In  1816  and  1817,  he  commandeda  steamboat  named  "  Chamiilain,  " 
on  the  hike  of  the  same  name.  This  was  the  secoad  steamboat  that  ever  sailed  on 
the  waters  of  that  beautiful  lake. 

When  navigation  closed  in  1S17,  Mr.  Jirush  settled  in  Montreal,  and  for  the  next 
sixteen  years  engaged  in  his  favorite  occupation  of  sieamboating  and  navigation — 
fiom  1818  to  1834.  Mr.  Brush  superintended  the  building  of  some  of  the  early 
steanijrs  ])Ut  on  the  St.  Lawrence  between  Montreal  and  (,)uebec.  He  built  the 
'■  Hercules"  in  1823,  the  first  tow-boat  that  ever  sailed  on  the  river. 

In  1838,  Mr.  Brush  went  into  partnership  with  the  Wards  in  the  Kagle  Foundry 
which  they  had  begun  in  1822.  In  time  he  became  the  sole  possessor  of  it,  and  in 
1852  his  eldest  son  became  intrusted  with  the  business.  Mr.  Brush  married  i'.liza 
M.  Seymour,  of  \'ergennes,  Vermont.  He  died  not  long  ago.  His  eldest  ^un^ 
George  S.  Brush,  is  now  the  head  of  the  firm  and  tlie  foundry. 

REV.  CANON   ANDERSON,  M.A. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  in  the  City  of  (Quebec,  January,  181  i,  therefore 
he  is  now  the  oldest  clergyman  of  the  Fnglish  Church  in  the  City  and  Diocese  of 
Montreal.  His  father  was  John  .Vnderson,  his  mother  Mary  Petry.  His  grand- 
father was  Anthony  Anderson,  of  Hcdley  Lodge,  M.P.I*,  for  Afegantic,  so  that  the 
Anderson  family  is  one  of  the  oldest  of  the  Flnglish  families  in  the  Province.  They 
came  originally  from  Nortlnmiherland,  England,  and  arrived  in  Canada  near  the 
close  of  the  last  cenuiry. 

Something  must  be  said  here  of  his  mother.  The  mother  has  a  great  deal  to  do 
in  the  after  career  of  the  son,  and  we  find  in  the  \'enerable  Canon  some  traits  tjf  that 
stern  justice  and  inflexible  character  which  must  have  marked  her  career  in  these 
early  days  of  Colonial  life  and  experience.  His  mother,  Mary  Petry,  was  of  old 
(lerman  descent.  She  was  the  daughter  of  Frederick  Petry,  of  Xierstein,  on  the  Rhine, 
and  the  niece  of  Dr.  Wiliiam  Petry,  wi  o  was  Surgeon  in  the  Prussian  Army  under 
F'rederick  the  Great,  having  the  charge  of  the  field  Lazaretto  under  that  conipiering 
Monarch  during  the  Seven  Vear-&gt;'  War.  He  afterwards  served  with  Gen.  Herkimer 
of  New  York  during  the  American  Revolutionary  War.  In  Stone's  "  Life  of  Brandt," 
honorable  mention  is  made  of  Dr.  Petry,  for  he  was  both  before  and  during  that 
fratricidal  war  a  prominent  Surgeon  of  the  Mohawk  Valley.  The  family  descendcUits 
remain  to  this  day  occupying  the  original  Petry  estates  in  the  town  of  Herkimer 
New  York. 

Rev.  Canon  .Anderson  received  his  education   at  Dr.  Wilkes'  School,  Quebec.

Rector  of  Sorel  in  1839,  '^^^^^  since  then  has  ever  continued  to  hold  this  position.  In

"  Was    born    ;U    Charlestown,    in   Fifeshire,    Scotland,    in   September,   1843.     He 
was   educated   at    the  scliools   of   his   native  phice.     At    the  age   of  eighteen    lie

latter  point,  a  change  was  made  from  the  old  broad  to  the  standard  gauge,  and  for  a 
full  year  e.ery  passenger  and  way  car  load  of  freight  had  to  be  transferred  at  Strat- 
ford, entailing   an   enormous  amount  of  additional  labor  and  trouble  on  both  Mr 
Whyte  and  his  staff.       15iit  his  plans  were  so  well  laid,   and   promi)tiy  carried  out, 
that  little  delay     and    no   blockade  was  occasioned  by  the  change.      In    1874,  he 
was  moved   to   London,   where  he  held  a  similar  position   till  January,  1881.     He 
was    then   ordered  to  Toronto,  to   take    the   entire  charre  of  the   important  freight 
ottices  and  sheds  at  that  city.    In  November  of  the  same  year  the  Company  acknow- 
ledged his  services  by  appointing  him  Assistant-Superintendent  of  the  Cential  Divi- 
sion from    Kingston  West  to  Stratford,  including  the  Gait  and  W:;terIoo  branches. 
After  remaining  in  that  position  for  about  a  year  and  a  half,  he  severed  his. connec- 
tion with  the  Grand  Trunk,  and  accepted  tiie  position  of  Genertd  Superintendent  of 
the  Credit  Valley  Railway  (May,  1883),  on  the  resignation  of  James  Ross.      F-oUow- 
ing  this  appointment  soon  came  that  to  the  management  of  the  Toronto,    Grey  and 
Ilruce,  which  in  September  of  the  same  year  became  a  part  of  the  Ontario  and  (Quebec 
system,  and  was  afterwards  designated  the  Ontario  Division  of  the  Canadian  Pacific. 
When  the  Ontario  and  Quebec  road  was  completed  m  August  of  1884,  its  manage- 
ment likewise   fell    under  tiie  control  of  Mr.  Whyte.     What  his  administration  has 
been  since  his  elevation  to  this  important  office  is  very  well  known.     'Corporations, 
it  is  beer,  well  said,  are   bodies  without  souls,  and  they  are  not  in  the  habit  of  pro- 
moting a  man  out  of  feelings  of  sentiment  or  of  friendship.      But  corporations  have 
ejes  ;  and  they  are  ever  on  the   alert  for  administrative  talent.    The  genius  for  the 
management  of  railway  traffic  which  Mr.  Whyte  possesses  was  perceived,  the  reader 
will  see,  as  soon  as  the  opportunity  for  the  dis[)lay  of  his  talents  was  opened  to  the 
subject  of  this  sketch.      Mr.  Whyte  is  a  man  of  cpiick  insight,  and  as  he  possesses  a 
cool  and  a  clear  head,  it  does  not  take  him  long  to  see  his  way  out  of  a  difficulty, 
and  come  to  a  decision.     Eminently,  it  may  be  repeated,  he  is  an  administrator,  be- 
ing above  all  things  swift  and  expedient,  and  sound  of  judgment.'    He  is  an  extremely 
popular  railway  official  ;  and  in  the  social  life  of  Toronto,  his  removal  from  that  city 
was  much  regretted.     Mr.  Whyte  married  in  1872,  Jane,  daughter  of  Adam  Scott,  of 
Toronto.     There  has  been  issue  by  this   marriage  a  family  of  three  girls  and  two 
boys."

HON.  ANSELME  F.  X.  TRUDEL 

Is  the  son  of  F.  X.  Trudcl  of  St.  Prospere,  District  of  Three  Rivers.  He  is  llio 
grandson  of  (IHvicr  Trudel,  Esq.,  of  Ste.  Genevieve  de  Batiscan,  who  represented 
Ciianiplain  County  in  the  Legislative  Assembly  of  Lower  Canada  f(jr  a  long  period. 
Mr.  Trudel  was  born  at  St.  Anne  de  la  Perade  on  the  29th  April,  1838.  He  was 
educated  at  Nicolet  College,  where  he  distinguished  himself  by  assiduity  in  his  studies. 
In  April,  1864,  he  mairied  Marie  Zoe  Ainiee,  daughter  of  the  Hon.  Louis  Renaud. 
He  was  called  to  the  Bar  of  the  Province  in  1861.  For  a  short  time  in  i860  he 
edited  the  well-known  paper,  La  Mincrvc.  He  was  during  several  years  Pre- 
sident of  the  Ccrcle  Litteraire  and  also  oi L'  Union  Catholique.  In  1S69,  his  services 
as  advocate  were  secured  conjointly  with  those  of  the  late  Mr.  Cassidy  and  L.  A. 
Jette,  M.P.  (new  the  Hon.  Judge  Jette),  by  the  Fahrique  of  Xotrc  Dame  de  Montreal 
for  the  fiimous  cause  "  Guibord." 

The  opinions  which  he  sustained  in  his  speech,  touching  the  freedom  of  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church's  complete  independence  and  its  civil  rights,  and  the  thesis 
which  he  developed  then  on  the  cjuestion  of  "  La  propriete  ecclesiastique,"  gave  vent 
to  considerable  discussion  in  the  press,  and  were  the  subject  of  tlattering  apprecia- 
tions from  many  publicists  and  economists  in  France,  Pelgium  and  Spain.  They 
determined  at  first  in  Canada  a  certain  excitation,  and  induced  the  Trustees  ( Mar- 
guilliers)  of  Notre  Dame  to  decline  to  employ  him  (Mr.  Trudel)  any  1  jore  in  the 
case,  and  even  a  vote  of  blame  was  jjassed  condemning  his  opinions,  and  is  still  in 
the  registers  of"  La  Fabrique."  This  censure  cause  j\Ir.  Trudel  to  submit  his  argu- 
ments to  the  judgment  of  the  Holy  See.  His  contested  opinions  were  approved  of, 
not  only  by  the  most  eminent  economists  of  Rome,  namely,  P.  Perone,  Drs.  De 
Angelis  and  Sanguinetti,  but  the  whole  pleading  was  the  subject  of  their  praises.  He 
was  one  of  the  authors  of  the  Programme  Catholique  (1871),  and  has  written  consider- 
ably in  the  various  journals  and  periodicals  of  the  day.  From  1867  to  1872  he 
sustained  in  the  press  many  polemics  on  the  question  of  the  Rights  of  the  Roman 
Church,  and  of  its  relations  with  the  civil  power,  'i'he  most  important  of  his  works 
has  been  published  in  part  in  the  Revue  Canadienne  for  1S70-71  under  the  title 
of  "  (^uekpies  considerations  sur  les  ra])ports  de  I'Kglise  et  de  I'Etat," 

He  thought  it  his  duly  10  discontinue  publication  on  account  of  the  irritation 
that  these  religious  polemics  had  created  among  the  Roman  Catholics  of  the  Province 
of  Quebec. 

Since  the  General  Elections  of  187 1  he  sat  for  Champlain  in  the  (Quebec 
Assembly,  He  was  called  to  the  high  position  of  Senator  of  Canada  on  the  31st 
October,  1873.  He  was  one  of  the  promoters  and  organizers  of  the  Canadian  Papal 
Zouaves.  Some  of  his  writings  have  been  published  in  the  Echo  dii  Cabinet  de 
Lecture,  in  1861,  1862  and  1863,  under  the  heads  of  "Destinies  of  the  Canadian 
People,"  "  Temperance,"  "  Frederick  Osanam  and  his  Works." 

For  some  years  previous  to  his  death  he  was  the  ruling  spirit  as  l";ditor-in-Chief 
and  proprietor  of  L Etendard,  one  of  the  most  influential  French  papers  in  Montreal.

Latterly  he  was  afflicted  with  heart  disease,  which  at  last  carried  him  off  a  (ew  years 
ago.  His  eldest  son  now  conducts  the  paper.  Another  son  is  an  Advocate  of  the 
Montreal  Bar.  They  are  born  citizens  of  Montreal,  and  seem  to  have  the  ability  of

WILLIAM  CASSILS 

''  Was  born  at  Denny,  Stirlingshire,  Scotland,  on  the  25th  June,  1832,  being  the  eldest 
son  of  John  Cassils  and  Margaret  Murray.  The  family  removed  in  1835  to  Rcnton, 
a  village  in  the  vale  of  Leven,  Dumbartonshire,  where  his  boyhood  was  spent,  and 
where  in  the  parochial  school  he  was  educated  in  such  branches  as  were  then  taught 
in  that  institution.  Having  relatives  in  Canada,  wiio  urged  that  lie  should  proceed 
thither,  he  sailed  from  Glasgow  in  the  barque  Euclid  o\\  April  5lh,  185 1,  arriving  at 
Quebec  in  tlie  first  week  of  May.  On  reaching  Montreal  a  couple  of  days  later,  and 
hearing  tliat  a  young  man  was  wanted  to  learn  operating  in  the  office  of  tiie  Montreal 
Telegraph  Company,  iie  applied  for  the  situation  and  was  accepted.  The  Company 
was  then  in  its  infancy  ;  it  owned  a  single  line  extending  along  the  highway  from 
Toronto  to  Quebec,  and  had  fourteen  offices  in  all,  between  these  two  points.  In 
November,  1853,  Mr.  Cassils  took  charge  of  the  Quebec  office,  and  three  years  later, 
the  Company  having  acquired  the  lines  of  the  British  American  Telegraph  Company, 
was  appointed  Eastern  Divisional  Superintendent.  On  the  nth  June,  1856,  he 
married  Agnes  Simpson,  daughter  of  the  late  William  Hossack  of  Quebec.  Resign- 
ing the  position  of  Telegraph  Superintendent  in  November,  1866,  Mr.  Cassils  re- 
moved to  Montreal,  becoming  a  member  of  a  commercial  firm,  from  wiiich  he 
retired  ten  years  later.  While  a  resident  of  Quebec  Mr.  Cassils  commanded  the 
esteem  of  a  wide  circle  of  acquaintances,  and  in  addition  to  active  participation  in 
church  and  charitable  work,  was  chosen  Secretary-Treasurer  of  the  Board  of  Pro- 
testant School  Commissioners  of  that  city,  which  position  he  held  during  several 
years.  Shortly  after  retiring  from  the  wholesale  trade  in  Montreal,  he  became 
President  of  the  Canada  Central  Railway  Company,  which  position  he  retained  for 
three  or  four  years,  until  1881,  when  the  line  became  part  of  the  Canadian  Pacific 
Railway  Company's  system.  His  careful  methodical  habits  of  business  becoming 
known,  his  services  were  i'^  request  by  other  public  companies.  He  subsequently 
became  Receiver  of  the  St.  Lawrence  and  Ottawa  Railway  Company,  and  now  occu- 
pies the  Presidency  of  the  following :  the  Dominion  Transport  Company,  limited 
(the  cartage  agents  of  the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway  Company),  the  Canadian  Dis- 
trict Telegraph  Company,  limited ;  and  of  the  Electro-Mechanical  Clock  Company, 
limited.  He  is  also,  we  believe,  Vice-President  of  the  British  American  Ranche 
Company,  limited ;  and  Director  of  the  Montreal  Herald  Printing  and  Publishing 
Company,  limited.  By  no  means  least  in  importance  of  the  positions  held  by  Mr. 
Cassils  in  connection  with  public  companies  is  his  directorship  in  the  Montreal 
Telegraph  Company,  which  has  1,680  offices  and  30,000  miles  of  wire  scattered  over 


GAZETTEER   OF   MONTREAL.  339 

Ontario,  Quebec  and  New  Brunswick,  as  well  as  over  large  parts  of  Vermont  and 
New  York  and  touching  Michigan.    His  fifteen  years  of  experience  in  the  early  days 
of  telegraphy  form  an  interesting  chapter  in  his  life.      Thirty-three  years  ago,  before 
the  time  of  submarine  cables,  the  wires  were  stretched  across  the  St.  Lawrence,  near 
Montreal;  in  summer,  masts  210  feet  higli  being  set  on  either  shore,  while  in  winter 
they  were  strung  on  poles  stuck  in  the  ice.      There  were  but   fourteen  offices  in  the 
five  hundred  miles  between  Quebec  and  Toronto,  and  telegrams  from  the  latter  city  to 
Montreal  cost  3s.  9  J.  currency.      The  modes  of  transmission,  such  as  the  Bain  and 
House  system,  as  well  as  the  more  successful  Morse   system,  had  not  then  passed 
the  experimental  stage,  while  the  instruments  were  clumsy,  and,  measured  by  the  pro- 
gress of  to-day,  ineffective  and  slow.     Having  been  a  practical  telegrapher,  however, 
'  in  the  day   of  small  things,'  electrically  considered,   and  having  watched  the  deve- 
lopment of  tlie  science  to  its  present  marvellous  stage,  the  experience  and  technical 
knowledge  of  tlie  man  we  are  describing  proves  of  decided  service  in  his  capacity  of 
director  to-day.     '  To  be  a  well-favored  man  is  the  gift  of  fortune,'   says  the  clown 
in  the  play,  words  which  are  hardly  less  absurd  than  the  rest  of  the  sentence,   '  but 
readin'  and  wrilin'  comes   by  natur'.'     A  man's  pleasant  looks  are  far  more  a  matter 
of  disposition,  surroundings  and  descent,  than  of  chance.      In   temperament  as  well 
as  in  aj)pearance,  Mr.  Cassils  is  perceptibly  a  debtor  to  his  parents,  who  were  both 
good  looking ;  the  fiitlier  being  fine-featured  and  atliletic,  the  mother  (who  still  sur- 
vives) fresh  and  douce.      Both  were  of  the  spirited,  sterling.   God-fearing  people  of 
whom  Scotland  has   fiirnished  so  many  to  this  and  other  lands.     Their  sons  and 
daughters,  eight  in  number,  are  all  in  Canada  ;  the  five  sons  are  among  the  respected 
business  men  of  .Montreal,  and  several  of  them  besides  the  eldest,  whom  we  are 
describing,  have  attained  positions  of  responsibility  and  prominence   in  that  great 
city.     To  be   called  '  a  popular  man  '  is  sometimes  an  ambiguous  compliment.      In 
Mr.  Cassils'  case,  the  popularity  enjoyed  is  founded  rather  upon  integrity,  geniality 
and  quiet  discernment  than  upon  more  sliowy  bat  less  admirable  qualities." 

WILLIAM  DARLING 

"  Was  born  in  Edinburgh,  Scotland,  in  1819,  and  when  he  was  in  his  twenty-first  year 
came  to  Canada,  establishing  himself  shortly  afterwards  at  Montreal,  where  so  dis- 
tinguished and  honorable  a  business  career  awaited  him.  His  father  having  adopted 
commerce  in  Edinburgh,  the  son  resolved  to  try  his  fortune  in  the  same  sphere  of 
activity  in  our  new  country.  He  entered  into  the  iron  and  hardware  trade,  and  re- 
mained connected  with  the  same  till  the  time  of  his  death,  achieving  a  wide  measure 
of  success.  Mr.  Darling  married  Miss  Davidson,  of  Edinburgh,  and  there  were  eight 
children  by  the  union,  two  of  whom  died  in  infancy.  Two  girls  grew  to  maturity, 
one  of  whom  married  Dr.  G.  W.  Ross,  of  Montreal,  and  died  suddenly  within  a  year 
of  her  marriage ;  the  other  died  unmarried,  f  Four  sons  grew  up  with  their  father's 
business,  and  were  associated  with  him  as  partners.  William  and  James  remained 
in  Montreal,  Andrew  and  Thomas  J.  went  to  Toronto,  and  took  charge  of  the  busi-

ness  there,  while  William  Darling,  the  subject  of  this  memoir,  continued  up  to  the 
time  of  his  death  a  partner  in  both  firms.  He  was  the  eldest  brother  of  Henry  W. 
Darling  and  Robert  Darling,  of  'I'oronto,  and  of  Thomas  and  Adam  Darling,  of 
Montreal.  The  business  of  the  two  hcniscs  which  Mr.  Darling  controlled  reached 
every  part  of  the  several  provinces,  and  while  its  style  never  changed,  its  methods  of 
operation  always  brought  credit  to  the  deceased  founder  for  honorable  and  ui)right 
dealing.  Since  1840,  he  has  been  constantly  and  prominently  identified  with  the 
commercial  and  political  interests  of  Montreal.  For  many  years  he  was  a  member 
of  the  C(juncil  of  the  15oard  of  Trade,  and  for  several  terms  its  president.  When 
the  Merchants  Ikink  was  in  trouble  several  years  ago,  such  was  the  confidence  (jf 
his  fellow  business  men  in  Mr.  Darling's  clear-sightedness,  that  he  was  called  by 
unanimous  voice  of  the  shareholders  to  take  \)an  in  the  management  of  the  JJank.  It 
was  largely  due  to  Mr.  Darling's  iiifluence  that  George  Hague  was  called  to  this  Hank, 
and  the  deceased  merchant  was  thereafter  Mr.  Hague's  right-hand  man.  In  1878, 
Mr.  Darling  was  the  Liberal  candidate  for  Montreal  West,  when  lie  was  defeated  by 
M.  H.  Gault.  Mr.  Darling  was  an  intimate  friend  of  tJie  Hon.  Alexander  Mac- 
kenzie, Hon.  Edward  Blake,  and  the  late  Hon.  L.  H.  Holton.  On  commercial  law, 
his  opinion  was  regarded  as  second  to  that  of  no  lawyer  in  the  Dominion,  and  he 
was  largely  concerned  with  Mr.  Abbott  in  framing  the  Insolvency  Act  that  was  re- 
pealed in  1879.  He  was  selected  by  the  Mackenzie  Government  as  commissioner 
to  expropriate  lands  for  the  enlarged  Lachine  Canal,  and  so  well  was  his  work 
appreciated,  that  on  the  change  of  Government  Sir  John  Macdonald  retained  him  in 
that  position  till  his  duties  were  completed.  He  died  at  his  residence  at  Hochelaga, 
on  the  i8th  of  November,  1885,  of  inflammation  of  the  lungs. 

"The  character  of  Mr.  Darling  was  the  very  higliest,  andhe  was  a  man  of  si)len- 
did  abilities.  Modesty  is  often  associated  with  men  of  the  highest  worth,  and  this 
was  eminently  so  in  the  case  of  Mr.  Darling,  and,  as  pointed  out  by  a  leading  news- 
paper after  his  death,  his  shyness  often  kept  him  in  the  background  when  liis 
talents  would  have  taken  him  to  the  front.  At  a  meeting  of  the  directors  of  ilie 
Merchants  Bank  of  Canada,  the  following  resolution  was  passed  ; — '  That  the  direc- 
tors of  the  Merchants  Bank  of  Canada  desire  to  place  on  record  their  deep  sense  of 
the  loss  the  Bank  and  mercantile  community  have  sustained  in  the  death  of  their 
late  esteemed  colleague,  Mr.  William  Darling.  His  large  experience  and  sound 
judgment  were  uniformly  used  in  the  advancement  of  the  interests  of  the  Bank,  and 
his  assiduous  attention  to  the  many  important  matters  brought  before  the  lioard 
greatly  contributed  to  the  i)Osition  the  Bank  now  occupies  in  the  community.  The 
directors  beg  to  convey  to  the  widow  and  family  of  the  deceased  their  sincere  con- 
dolence on  the  loss  they  have  sustained,  and  for  the  purpose  of  duly  conveying  to 
them  this  mark  of  appreciation  and  sympathy,  direct  that  a  copy  of  this  minute,  duly 
engrossed  and  signed,  be  forwarded  by  the  President  and  General  Manager  on  be- 
half of  the  Bank.  Andrew  Allan,  President;  G.  Hague,  General  Manager.'  The 
Council  of  the  Board  of  Trade  of  Montreal  passed  the  following  :  '  Resolved — that

the  Council  of  ihc  Montreal  Hoard  o(  Trade  fully  recognizes  tiie  valuable  and 
varied  services  so  luiliringly  rendered  to  the  commercial  and  trade  interests  of  this 
city  by  the  late  William  Darling,  Ksq.,  during  the  many  years  in  which  he  served 
as  a  member  of  the  Council,  and  afterwards  as  President  of  the  Hoard,  and  the 
Council  now  records  its  deep  sense  of  the  loss  sustained  by  Montreal  in  his  de- 
cease ;  that  a  copy  of  this  resolution  be  communicated  to  the  bereaved  family, 
together  with  an  ex|)ression  of  the  sincere  sympathy  of  tiie  Council.  I'ermit  me 
to  say,  that  I  personally  share  in  the  regrets  of  the  Council,  and  lender  also  my 
respectful  condolence,  I  am,  dear  sir,  yours  sincerely,  W.  |.  Patterson,  Secre- 
tary; William  Darling,  l'".s(|.'  Mr.  Darling  was  often  consulted  by  his  brother 
merchants,  and  was  frequently  called  as  arbitrator  between  them,  as  well  as  for 
the  Government  in  disputes  that  would  otherwise  have  been  carried  bef(jre  the 
higher  Courts  in  the  Dominion,  He  was  much  devoted  to  farming  and  gardening, 
and  these  occui)ations  he  carried  on  to  some  extent  at  his  residence,  JJloomfield 
House,  Hochelaga." 

JOHN   KEADK 

'■  ^V^\s  born  at  Jjallyshannon,  County  Donegal,  Ireland,  on  the  13th  November,  1S37. 
He  was  educated  at  Portora,  Royal  School,  I'lnniskillen.  and  (Vaeen's  ('oUege,  Hel- 
fast.  He  came  to  Canada  in  1856,  and  assisted  by  some  fiiends  established  the 
Montreal  Literary  .]fa^i^azinc\  which,  though  favonibly  received  by  the  press,  failed 
for  want  of  support  from  the  ])ublic.  Mr.  Reado  afterwards  became  associated  for  a 
time  with  the  Montreal  Gazette,  and  passed  some  years  between  journalism  and  jiri- 
vate  tuition.  In  1859,  he  began  the  study  of  Daw,  passing  the  i)reiiminiary  examina- 
tion, but  learning  that  the  Rectorship  of  Lachule  College  was  vacant,  he  applied  for 
the  situation,  which  he  obtained,  retaining  the  same  for  three  years.  During  this 
time  he  was  able  to  pursue  the  study  of  Theology,  and  in  1864-65  was  ordained  by 
Bishop  Fulford  as  a  clergyman,  and  in  that  capac:ity  served  in  the  Eastern  Town- 
ships. In  1868-9,  ^I''-  Heade  had  charge  of  a  Church  of  England  journal  in  Mon- 
treal, and  renewed  his  connection  with  the  ])ress  of  the  latter  city,  which  connection 
has  since  continued,  J"'or  the  last  sixteen  years,  with  the  exception  of  an  interval  of 
a  year  or  so  spent  in  the  country,  Mr.  Reade  has  been  connected  with  the  Montreal 
Gazette.  Since  1874  he  has  been  regularly  on  its  staff  as  literary  and  assistant 
general  editor.  But  it  is  as  an  author,  as  the  writer  of  verse,  that  Mr.  Reade  has 
the  greatest  claim  upon  the  biographer.  Among  his  contributions  to  the  higher 
class  literature  may  be  mentioned,  '  The  Prophecy  of  Merlin  and  other  Poems,' 
Dawson  Brothers,  1870.  Since  the  appearance  of  this  volume,  Mr.  Reade  has

of  Herder,  .Schiller,  Koerner,  Heine,  etc.  ;  and  from  the  Italian  of  Leopardi,  Caterina 
Franceschi,  Alfieri,  etc,  .Some  of  the  latter  translations  were  highly  commended  in 
the  lico  t/'/fa/ia,  of  New  York.  Mr.  Reade  has  also  written  some  tales  : — '  Winty 
Dane's  Transformation,'  '  The  De  Chalneys,'  '  The  Kcclestons,'  etc.  He  has  con- 
tributed either  prose  or  verse  to  every  magazine  or  review  that  has  been  started  in 
Canada  during  tlie  last  thirty  years  ;  r.nd  he  purposes  publishing  soon  a  volume  of 
essays  on  subjects  connected  wi'h  Canadian  history,  literature,  etc.  Some  of  these 
were  papers  read  before  the  Montreal  Athenaeum,  Kukios  Club,  Literary  and  His- 
torical Society  of  Quebec  (of  which  Mr.  Reade  is  an  honorary  member),  the  Royal 
Society,  etc.  Others  were  delivered  as  lectures,  and  others  contributed  to  magazines, 
while  several  have  not  been  in  any  way  made  known  to  the  public.  Among  the 
collection  are  these:  'Were  the  Ancient  Britains  savage  or  civilized?'  'Thomas 
D'Arcy  IS^r^'iee  as  a  Poet,'  'Exploration  before  Columbus,'  'History  in  Geogra- 
phical Names,'  '  The  Origin  of  Canadian  Geographical  Names,'  '  Origin  and  Early 
History  of  the  Alphabet,'  'The  Half-breed,'  'Language  as  Indicating  Conquest,' 
*  British  Canada  in  the  Last  Century,'  '  Some  Curious  Kinships — an  Essay  in  Phil- 
ology,' 'The  Ethnology  of  Canada,' and  a  critical  and  historical  sketch  of  *  Cana- 
dian Literature.'  This  work  will  probably  be  published  soon.  .Some  of  Mr. 
Readc's  historical  papers  have  been  translated  into  French.  One  of  them,  a  review 
of  Abbe  Desmazure's  admirable  biography  of  Abbe  Taillon,  author  of  the  •' Histoire 
de  la  Colonic  Francaise,"  and  quite  a  library  of  other  works,  was  translated  and 
published  in  Paris  in  one  volume.  Of  the  work  of  Mr.  Reade  there  has 
been  but  the  one  verdict  by  all  the  critics,  namely,  that  it  is  fine  and  true, 
exhibiting  all  those  varieties  of  excellence  that  go  to  make  verse  imperishable. 
Writing  to  Mr.  Reade  of  the  volume  referred  to,  the  late  William  Cullen  Bryant 
said :  '  It  is  no  small  merit  in  my  eyes  that  you  have  avoided  that  misty  phrase- 
ology in  which  so  many  poets  of  the  day  are  accustomed  to  wrap  up  their  reflec- 
tions, and  that  you  clothe  yours  in  a  transparent,  luminous  diction.'  John  J. 
Whittier  describes  'Dominion  Day'  as  'a  fine  outburst  of  patriotic  song,'  and 
bestows  general  praise  upon  Mr.  Reade's  work.  A  like  commendation  came  to 
the  author  from  Longfellow.  But  hosts  of  competent  critics  have  employed  their 
pens  in  praise  of  Mr.  Reade's  work,  and  the  paper  by  L'Abbe  Verreau,  in  the 
Reinie  de  Alontreal,  is  a  comprehensive  tribute  to  the  achievements  of  our 
author.  We  produce  the  following  stanza?,  '  Thalatta,  Thalatta,'  for  they  exhibit 
so  many  qualities,  grace,  ease,  fervor  and  the  lyrical  lament  : — 


In  my  ear  is  the  moan  of  the  pines — in  my  heart  is  the  song  of  the  sea, 
And  I  feel  his  salt  breath  on  my  face  as  he  showers  his  kisses  on  me  ; 
And  I  hear  the  wild  scream  of  the  gulls,  as  they  answer  the  call  of  the  tide, 
And  I  watch  the  fair  sails  as  they  glisten  like  gems  on  the  breast  of  a  bride.

II. 

From  the  rock  where  I  stand  to  the  sun  is  a  pathway  of  s.ipphire  and  gold, 
Like  a  waif  of  those  I'atmian  visions  that  rapt  the  lone  seer  of  old  ; 
And  it  seems  to  my  soul  like  an  omen  that  calls  me  far  over  the  sea — 
But  I  think  of  a  little  white  cottage  and  one  that  is  dearest  to  me. 

III. 

Westward  ho  !  Far  aw.iy  to  tiie  Fast  is  a  cottage  tliat  looks  to  the  shore — 
Though  each  drop  in  tlie  sea  were  a  tear,  as  it  was  I  can  see  it  no  more — 
For  the  heart  of  its  pride  with  the  flowers  of  tlie   '  Vale  of  the  Shadosv '  reclines, 
And — hushed  is  the  song  of  the  sea  and  hoarse  is  the  moan  of  the  pines. 

This  is  at  once  true  to  nature  and  the  Iieart  of  humanity,  witliout  wliich  qualities 
death  must  wait  upon  all  verse.  How  accurately  the  discerning  eye  of  Mr.  Hryant 
judged  of  tlie  quality  of  such  work,  for  if  ever  diction  was  transparent  and 
luminous,  the  above  surely  is,  and  like  the  above  is  all  of  Mr.  Reade's  verse." 

DAVID  TORRANCE. 

"  Mr.  Torrance,  during  his  lifetime  one  of  Montreal's  most  successful  and  dis- 
tinguished merchants,  was  of  Scotch  parentage.  He  was  born  in  New  York 
in  1805,  and  died  in  Montreal,  January  29th,  1876.  When  yet  a  boy  lie  came  to 
Kingston,  Upper  Canada  (now  Ontario),  with  his  fatlier,  James  Torrance,  who  was 
then  extensively  engaged  in  business  in  that  town.  In  182 1,  he  removed  to  Montreal, 
and  became  a  clerk  with  hi.i  uncle,  tlie  late  John  Torrance,  who  kept  a  place  of  busi- 
ness at  the  corner  of  St.  Paul  and  St.  Nicholas  streets.  By  his  close  attention  to  his 
duties,  and  aptitude  to  the  work,  he  rapidly  rose  in  iiis  employer's  estimation,  which 
ended  in  iiis  being  taken  into  partnership  in  1833.  During  his  clerkship  tiie  late 
Rev.  Dr.  Wilkes  and  the  late  Hon.  John  Young  were  engaged  in  the  same  establish- 
ment. With  the  view  of  extending  the  business  of  the  concern,  in  1835  ^^'^-  Torrance 
entered  into  partnersiiip  with  Mr.  Young,  of  Quebec,  under  the  firm  name  of  Torrance 
&amp;  Young  ;  and  on  tiie  retirement  of  tiie  late  John  Torrance,  the  senior  member,  the 
firm's  name  was  clianged  to  that  of  D.  Torrance  &amp;  Co.,  which  continued  to  the  date 
of  his  demise,  his  partners  being  for  many  years  Thomas  Cramp,  and  his  son  John 
Torrance.  In  1826,  the  old  firm  purchased  a  tug  and  passenger  boat,  the  Hercules, 
from  John  Handyside  &amp;  Co.,  and  placed  it  under  the  command  of  Captain  Brush, 
who  afterwards  became  the  proprietor  of  the  Eagle  Foundr\-,  Montreal.  This  was 
the  first  step  towards  the  establishment  of  an  opposition  line  to  the  Molsons' steam- 
boats, then  plying  on  the  St.  Lawrence,  and  its  stock  was  eventually  merged  in  that 
of  the  Richelieu  Steamboat  Company  (now  the  Richelieu  and  Ontario  Navigation 
Company).  Mr.  Torrance  was  early  alive  to  the  great  future  in  store  for  Montreal, 
and  was  the  first  to  launch  out  into  direct  trade  with  the  East  Indies  and  China,  and

for  over  thirty  yc.irs  tlie  nanie  ofliis  firm  lias  been  well  known  in  llu'  great  Eastern 
centres  of  commerce.     As  a  business  man    he  was  remarkable  for   great  force  of 
character  ;ind  determination.     Tiiis,  combined  with  unflinching  industry  and  regular 
habits,  made  th(;  immense  business  of  the  firm  move  ahead  with  jirecision.     An  old 
friend  ofliis  once  said  of  him.   '  IK'  was  a  model  mnn   in  regard  to  his  business  and 
social  habits,  and  in  the  days  of  his    prosjierily  was  as  regular  in   his  attendance  at 
the  counting  house  as  when  he  first  started  in  business.      His  ambition  was  great,  but 
tein|)ered  with  prudence,  and  though   he  engaged  in    commercial    ventures  in  other 
cities  than  Montreal,  yet  was   uniformly  successful.'     Jk-sides   his  ])romotion  of  com- 
merce and  navigation,  he  likewise  proved  himself  a  stay  to  our  banking  system,  and 
after   holding  office  for  a  long  time  as  one  of  the  Directors  of  the  Hank  of  Montreal, 
he  was   in  187.^  elected  President,  which   responsible  position  he  held  at  the  lime  of 
his  death.      His  firm  was    also   one    of  the  originators    of  the    Dominion   .Steamship 
Company.      While  largely   engaged  in  ocean    commerce,    his  capital   and  resources 
were  also  de\()led  to  tlu'  carrying  on  of  our  inland  forwarding  trade.      He  was  a  dili- 
gent merchant,  and  did  not  nn;ddle  mucli  in  jjiiblic  affiirs.   though  he  was  a  consis- 
tent f-iberal  in   i)olitics  throughout.     To  all    benevolent   and  charitable  schemes  he 
was  a  frecpieiU  and  liberal   giver.      He  was   always  ready  to  aid  the    distressed  and 
bring  joy  to  those  in  want,  and  the  main  feature  in  this  regard  was  the  unostentatious 
way   ill  which  he  helped  those  in  need.     He  was  a  member  of  the  .St.  James   Street 
Methodist  Churchy  and  at  the  time  of  his  death  was  one  of  its  trustees.    He  was,  in  fact, 
the  thorough  type  of  a  merchant  jirince,   a  representative  of  a  class  which,  unfortun- 
ately, is  far  too  small  in  these  latter  days.      He  was  married  to  his  cousin,  the  eldest 
daughter  of  the  late  John  'I'orrance.      He  was  in  feeble  health  some  years  ])revious 
to  his  death,  and  had  only  a  few  months  before  to  forego  active  business,  and  when 
death  at  last  came  he  passed  away  cpiietly,  surrounded  by  his  sorrowing  family."

Gyna3cological  Society,  and  Professor  Emeritus,  McGill  University,  Montr^^al, 
was  born  in  the  Province  of  Quebec,  on  the  12th  November,  1825.  By  descent  Dr. 
Campbell  is  a  pure  Celt,  being  the  son  of  John  MacCallum  and  Mary  Campbell. 
His  maternal  grandfather,  Malcolm  Campbell  of  Killin,  during  his  lifetime  widely 
known  and  highly  esteemed  through  the  Perthshire  Highlands,  was  a  near  kinsman 
and  relative,  through  the  Lochiel  Camerons,  of  the  Earl  of  Breadalbane.  Dr.  Mac- 
Callum received  his  medical  education  at  McGill  University,  at  which  institution  he

PIERRE  GUY. 

"  The  Guy  family,  of  ancient  and  noble  origin,  supposed  to  be  a  branch  of  the  Guy 
de  Montfort  family,  has  been  distinguished  for  the  valuable  services,  military  and  civil, 
which  its  members  have  rendered  to  the  Province  of  Quebec,  botii  under  the  old  and 
new  rigimes.  Pierre  Guy,  the  first  of  the  name  to  settle  in  Canada,  joined  the  French 
army  under  M.  de  Vaudreuil,  in  which  he  rose  rapidly  to  the  rank  of  captain.  He  took 
an  active  part  in  the  engagements  which  were  then  so  frequent  between  theFrench  in 
Quebec  and  English  in  Massachusetts  and  New  York.  He  died  at  the  early  age  of  forty- 
eight.  His  son  Pierre,  who  was  sent  to  France,  and  received  a  thorough  and  careful 
education,  also  joined  the  French  army  and  distinguished  himself  under  General  Mont, 
calm  at  the  battle  of  Carillon,  and  in  the  following  year  at  Montmorency.  The  battle  of 
the  Plains  of  Abraham  having  annihilated  the  power  of  France  in  Canada,  young 
Guy  with  others  left  for  France  after  the  capitulation  of  the  country,  where  he  re- 
mained till  1764.  Returning  to  Canada,  he  accepted  the  situation,  entered  into 
business  at  Montreal,  and  became  a  loyal  subject  of  Great  Britain.  Shortly  after, 
when  General  Montgomery  invaded  Canada,  he  took  up  arms  for  the  defence  of  the 
country,  and  this  so  exasperated  the  Americans  that  they  sacked  liis  stores  after  the 
capitulation  of  Montreal.  In  1776,  he  received  from  the  Crown  the  appointment  of 
Judge,  which  at  that  time  was  considered  a  signal  mark  of  fixvor,  and  in  1802  he  was 
promoted  to  the  rank  of  Colonel  of  Militia.  A  man  of  great  attainments  and 
scholarly  parts,  lie  was  an  ardent  promoterof  all  educational  projects.  He  was  one 
of  the  most  active  in  the  foundation  of  the  College  .St.  Raphael,  under  tlie  control  of 
the  gentlemen  of  the  Seminary  of  the  Sulpician  Order,  and  which  still  exists  and 
flourishes  under  the  name  of  the  *  College  of  Montreal.'  He  died  in  1S12,  and  left 
several  sons  and  daughters.  Louis,  who,  by  the  death  of  his  brother,  became  the 
eldest  of  the  family,  was  an  intimate  friend  and  adviser  of  Sir  James  Kempt,  and 
subsequently  of  I.,ord  Aylmer.  He  was  made  a  Councillor  by  King  William  in  Feb- 
ruary, 1831.  He  died  in  1840.  Of  his  family,  Judge  Hippolyte  Guy  was  the  second 
son  The  eldest  son,  named  Louis,  received  a  commission  as  Lieutenant  in  the 
British  Army,  through  the  influence  of  the  Duke  of  Wellington,  in  consideration  of 
the  bravery  he  had  disi)layed  at  the  battle  of  Chateauguay,  where  he  gallantly  led 
the  advanced  guard  of  the  Voltigeurs.  Several  years  before  entering  the  British  army 
he  served  as  a  member  of  the  body  guard  of  Charles  X.  of  France,  into  which  no  one 
was  admitted  who  was  not  of  proved  noble  origin.  Judge  Guy  married  the  adopted 
daughter  of  Chief  Justice  Valli^res,  and  had  four  children,  a  son  who  died  in  youth, 
and  three  daughters.  The  eldest  of  the  latter  is  married  to  Chief  Justice  Austin, 
late  of  Nassau,  Bahamas,  and  the  yotmgest  to  Gustave  Fabre,  brother  to  Archbishop 
Fabre,  Montreal."

DUKE  OF  RICHMOND,  K.G. 

Charles  CIordon  Lennox,  fourth  Duke  ofRiclimond,  Earl  of  March,  and  Baron 
of  Sittrington  in  the  peerage  of  England  ;  Duke  of  Lennox,  Earl  of  Darnley  and 
Baron  Mcthuen  in  the  peerage  of  Scotland,  and  Duke  d'Aubigny  in  France,  was  the 
only  son  of  l^ieutenant-General  Lord  George  Henry  Lennox,  by  Louisa,  daughter  of 
the  fourth  ALarquis  of  Lothian,  having  been  born  in  1764.  His  Grace  succeeded 
General  Sherbrooke  in  the  Government  of  Canada,  on  the  29th  July,  1819.  He  had 
previously  held  the  liigh  and  distinguished  office  of  Lord-Lieutenant  of  Ireland,  in 
which  he  had  given  much  satisfaction  to  the  people  of  that  distracted  country. 

His  administration  of  the  (iovernment  here  was  not  of  a  i)rolonged  nature;  but 
during  the  short  time  he  held  the  reins  of  power,  he  did  much  to  show  the  deter- 
mined and  energetic  nature  of  his  character  ;  more  particularly  on  the  occasion  when 
the  Legislature  having  refused  to  grant  any  supplies  to  defray  the  Civil  List,  he 
drew  on  ihe  Receiver-General  on  his  own  responsibility.  Death  cut  short  the  career 
of  this  great  man,  on  the  27lh  August,  1820,  during  a  tour  of  inspection  in  ITpper 
Canada,  singularly  enough  through  the  bite  of  a  tame  fox,  not  expected  to  be  in  a 
rabid  state,  with  which  he  was  amusing  himself.  His  demise  occurred  at  a  village 
on  the  Ottawa,  and  called  after  himself;  his  remains  were  conveyed  to  Quebec,  and 
buried  in  the  English  Cathedral  of  that  ancient  city. 

His  Grace  had  married  in  1789,  Charlotte,  daughter  of  the  ff)urtli  Duke  of  Gor- 
don, by  whom  he  had  a  large  jjrogeny. 

The  original  letter,  which  we  produce,  describing  the  manner  of  his  death,  was 
written  by  a  member  of  his  staff,  and  may  be  interesting  to  our  readers  : — 

"  Quebec,  .September  6. — Vou  will  learn  from  the  Quebec  papers  the  melancholy 
event  of  the  death  of  his  Grace  the  Duke  of  Richmond  ;  but  notwithstanding  what 
you  will  observe  in  them,  it  is  aftirmed  a  case  of  hydrophobia  was  the  cause  of  this 
sad  catastrophe,  and  it  is  asserted  to  have  originated  from  the  bite  of  a  fox  on  the 
28th  of  Jnne.  His  Grace  having  left  this  place  about  the  24th  of  June  on  an  exten- 
sive tour  through  the  Canadas,  after  his  arrival  at  William  Henry,  one  hundred  and 
thirty-five  miles  up  the  river,  whilst  walking  about  the  village  with  his  little  dog 
Blucher,  met  a  fox  about  the  jjlace,  with  which  the  dog  appeared  sociable,  and  they 
entered  into  play  together.  His  Grace  seemed  much  pleased,  and  expressed  some- 
thing like  a  wish  that  the  fox  should  be  purchased.  Accordingly,  the  hint  was 
attended  to  by  a  servant  belonging  to  the  suit,  who  purchased  the  fox  the  same  night. 
Next  morning  Sir  C.  Saxton,  seeing  the  fox  tied  to  a  tent  pitched  for  the  accommo- 
dation of  the  servants,  and  apparently  much  irritated  from  his  restrained  situation 
under  a  scorching  sun,  desired  that  the  animal  should  be  removed  somewhere  in  the 
shade.  He  was  then  fixed  to  a  wicket-gate  in  the  front  of  the  house.  His  Grace, 
on  coming  out  in  the  morning,  observed  the  fox,  which  he  knew  to  be  the  same  he 
had  seen  the  day  before,  went  up  to  him,  saying,  '  Is  this  you,  my  little  fellow?' 
and  on  offering  to  put  out  his  hand  to  caress  the  fox,  Sir  Charles  Saxton  touched  the

Duke  on  the  shoulder  to  prevent  it,  appraising  his  (iraceat  the  same  lime  of  the 
irritation  of  the  fox,  and  tliat  he  miglit  bite.  *  No,  no,'  said  his  (Irace,  '  tiie  Httle 
fellow  will  not  bite  me  I '  and  putting  out  his  hand,  the  fox  snapjjed,  and  made  three 
scratches  on  the  back  of  his  hand,  which  drew  blood.  His  Grace,  (juickly  drawing 
it  back  said,  '  Indeed,  my  friend,  you  bite  very  hard.'  The  next  morning  his  Grace 
found  an  uneasy  sensation  in  his  shoulder  ;  but  nothing  furthered  occurred  till  near 
returning  from  his  tour  ;  when  at  die  new  back  settlement  of  Perth,  on  the  32nd  or 
23rd  of  .'Vugust,  after  having  returned  from  walking,  his  Grace  desired  his  servant  to 
make  two  glasses  of  wine  and  water  for  himself  and  Major  Bowles.  As  soon  as  the 
Duke  took  the  wine  and  water,  he  observed  to  the  ^[ajor  that  he  felt  a  strange  sen- 
sation on  drinking  it.  On  the  way  from  Perth  towards  the  Ottawa  River,  some  of  the 
attendants  observed  his  irritability,  and  extreme  aversion  to  water  on  crossing  the 
smallest  streamlets  in  the  woods,  and  they  could  scarcely  get  him  along.  On  his 
approaching  a  small  hut  on  the  Ottawa  River,  rather  than  go  into  a  house  close  to 
the  river,  he  turned  short  and  ran  into  a  barn  ;  at  another  time  he  ran  from  them 
into  the  woods,  as  if  to  shun  the  sight  uf  water.  His  disorder  was  now  rapidly 
increasing  ;  but  on  his  arrival  ^within  six  miles  this  side  of  the  new  named  place 
Richmond,  after  suffering  excruciating  torments,  he  died  at  eight  o'clock  on  Saturday 
niorning,  the   28lh  of  August." 

The  following  is  an  extract  from  the  Montreal  Herald  of  that  day  ;  — 
"  In  public  life  he  was  steady,  firm  and  decisive  in  his  measures.  He  was  ac(  es- 
sible  to  all  who  chose  to  prefer  their  complaints  to  him  ;  and  when  he  was  compelled 
to  refuse  their  i)rayers,  he  anxiously  studied  to  convey  that  refusal  in  terms  the  least 
unpleasing  to  the  feelings  of  the  a[)plicant.  In  [irivate  life  his  affable  condescension 
was  gratifying  to  all  around  him  ;  and  although  he  could  descend  to  the  social  inter- 
course of  the  domestic  circle,  he  never  lost  sight  of  that  native  dignity  which  rei)el!ed 
imjiroper  liberties,  and  checked  the  forward.  In  early  life,  devoted  from  choice  to 
the  jjrofession  of  arms,  lie  evinced  that  most  valuable  of  all  qualities  in  an  officer, 
the  power  of  seeming  the  attachment  of  those  under  him.  And  when  he  al'terwards 
came  to  be  employed  in  the  more  difficult  and  complex  duties  of  a  ruler,  he  pertormed 
the  office  so  as  to  secure  him  the  esteem  and  confidence  of  his  sovereign,  and  the 
ardent  atlachmeiit  of  those  people  over  whom  he  was  placed.  A  striking  instance 
of  this  was  evinced  in  his  appointment  as  Lcjrd-Lieutenant  of  Ireland.  At  a  time 
when  contending  jiarties  and  discontented  individuals  distracted  the  jjublic  mind  in 
that  country,  his  Grace's  behavior  soon  produced  the  happiest  result.  His  affable 
condescension  pleased  all  parties ;  his  confidence  gained  their  esteem  ;  and  they  soon 
discover'^d  that  the  chief  aim  of  his  administration  was  to  relieve  their  distresses,  and 
promote  tli^ir  happiness.  Ai  the  present  time,  though  twelve  years  have  elapsed 
since  his  appointment  to  office,  the  anniversary  of  the  arrival  of  the  Duke  of  Richmond 
in  Ireland  still  continues  to  be  celebrated  in  that  country  with  the  warmest  enthusiasm 
and  most  gratifying  recollection  of  the  event.  And  that  we  consider  a  higher  tribute 
to  his  memory  than  '  st(jried  urn  or  monumental  epitaph  '  can  ever  {)erpetuate."

It  was  resolved  by  the  magistrates  in  Montieal,  in  consequence  of  the  death  of 
this  lamented  nobleman,  that  the  public  should  be  requested  to  wear  mourning  for 
thirty  days. 

COLONEL  DeSALABERRY,  C.15. 

TiiK  family  of  DeSalaberry  is  descended  from  a  noble  family  of  the  Pays  des  Basques 
(Navarre).  The  father  of  the  subject  of  this  notice  was  a  Legislative  Councillor, 
and  devotedly  attached  to  his  Sovereign,  so  much  so  indeed  that  he  placed  his  four 
sons  in  the  army. 

"The  Hun.  Charles  Michel  d'lrumberry  DeSalaberry,  C.B.,  surnamed  the  Cana- 
dian Leonidas,  was  born  at  the  Manor  House  of  Beauport  November,  19th,  1778. 
He  married  Demoiselle  Hertel  de  Rouville,  and  served  during  the  space  of  eleven 
years  in  the  West  Indies,  under  General  Prescott.  At  the  siege  of  Fort  Matilda 
under  Prescott,  he  commanded  the  Grenadier  company  of  the  41)1  battalion,  60th 
Regiment,  which  covered  the  retreat.  In  1795,  he  served  at  the  conquest  of  Martin- 
ique ;  became  Aide-de-Camp  to  Major-General  de  Rottenburg,  and  accompanied 
him  in  the  \Valcheren  Kxpedition.  Circumstances  recalled  him  to  his  country, 
where  he  formed  the  Voltigeurs  ;  and  Lieutenant-Colonel  commanding  this  fine  corps, 
he  was  selected  as  one  of  the  chiefs  of  the  staff  of  the  Militia.  Attacked  at  Lacolle, 
at  tiie  end  of  1812,  he  fought  the  Americans  until  night  ;  in  attempting  to  surround 
him,  they  fired  against  each  other,  which  soon  terminated  in  their  retreat  ;  thus 
ended  the  first  battle  of  DeSalaberry  and  the  Voltigeurs.  DeSalaberry,  in  proceed- 
ing  to  discover  tiie  whereabouts  of  General  Ham])ton,  obstructed  the  road  from  Odel- 
town  to  L'Acadie,  by  cutting  down  a  great  many  trees.  After  several  skirmishes, 
the  Americans  retired  to  a  place  called  Four  Corners.  His  adversary  made  an 
incursion  into  his  camp,  at  the  head  of  two  hundred  Voltigeurs  and  one  hundred 
and  fifty  Indian  warriors  of  the  tribe  of  Lower  Canada,  and  threw  the  enemy  into 
disorder,  without  any  loss  on  his  own  side,  Hampton  being  repulsed  in  the  Odel- 
town  route,  resolved  wisely  to  effect  a  junction  with  his  Chief  General,  in  taking  the 
route  leading  to  Chateauguay.  DeSalaberry  was  too  sagacious  not  to  discover  that 
this  strategic  point  was  the  road  which  Hampton  would  be  sure  to  take  in  order  to 
jom  Dearborn.  The  former,  in  the  meantime,  swept  away  the  English  pickets,  and 
Major  Henry  with  difficulty  resisted  them  ;  when  DeSalaberry  ably  shifted  his 
position,  and  threw  himself  on  the  route  to  face  that  General.  The  Canadian  hero, 
who  had  the  advantage  of  being  acquainted  with  the  whole  of  tiie  country  above 
the  Chateauguay,  then  ascended  to  the  left  of  the  bank  of  the  river,  to  reach  the 
other  extremity  of  a  wood,  where  he  knew  there  was  an  excellant  position  in  a 
swamp,  intercepted  by  deep  rivulets.  On  four  of  these  he  established  lines  of 
defence  in  succession.  The  fourth  was  about  half  a  mile  in  the  rear,  and  commanded 
a  ford  on  the  right  shore,  which  was  a  very  important  point  of  defence,  with  a  view 
to  the  protection  of  the  left  bank.  He  caused  to  be  erected  on  each  of  these  lines  a 
sort  of  breastwork,  which  was  extended  some  distance   in  the  woods,  to  protect  his 


GAZETTEER    OF   MONTREAL.  35 1 

right.     The  breastwork  on  his  first  line  formed  an  obtuse  angle  on  the  right  of  tlie 
road.     On   the  24th  of  October,  the  An^erican    General  advanced  at    tlie  head    of 
seven  hundred  infantry  and  four  hundred  horse,  witli  twelve  pieces  of  artillery,  send, 
ing  during  the  night  Col.  Purdy  to  take  possession  of  the    ford,  but  this  officer  lost 
liis  way  in  the  woods.     The  next  day,  Hampton  made  an  advance  in  person  towards 
tlie  abattis,  with  3,500  men,  and  placed  Purdy  at  the  head  of  1,500  men,  to  attempt 
again  to  turn  the  Canadians,    leaving  in  reserve  the  remainder  of  his   troops.     De« 
Salaberry  warned  of  this  movement,  by  the  fire  directed   on  his  advanced  pickets, 
now  seeing  before  him  an  enemy  whom  he  had  on  two   former  occasions  brought  to 
the  charge,  advanced  in  front ;  and,  giving  the  signal,   placed  himself  in  the  centre 
of  the  first  line  of  defence,    leaving  the  second  in  charge  of  Lieut.-Col.   Macdonnell. 
The  firing  commenced  on  both  sides,  but  badly  directed  by  the  Americans.      They 
firod  better  afterwards  ;    meanwhile,    the  circumstance  of  hearing  incessantly  the 
reports  from  the  corps  at  different  intervals,  led  them  to  believe  that  the  Canadians 
were  advancing  in  great  numbers,  and  their  ardor  began  to  weaken.     Purdy's  column 
arrived  at  the  ford  during  the  engagement,  but  was  repulsed  and  thrown  into  disorder 
by  DeSalaberry,  who  had  directed  his  attention  to  that  particular  spot.     Seeing  his 
plan  disconcerted  by  the  defeat  of  tliat  division,   the  American  Commander  ordered 
a  retreat,  which  he  effected  with  considerable  loss.      DeSalaberry  slept  on   tlic  field 
of  battle,  and  on  the  following  day  at  daybreak  he  was  joined  by  Captain  de  Rouville, 
his    brother-in-law,    with    his    company   of  Voltigcurs,    the    Watteville  Grenadiers, 
together  witli  a  few  of  the  native  warriors.     On  the  28th  he  sent  Captain  Ducharnie, 
with  one  hundred  and  fifty  warriors,  to  reconnoitre,  and  they  assured  him  tliat  the 
Americans  had  abandoned  their  camp  on  Piper's  road,  and  returned  to   Plattsburg. 
Wilkinson,  who  was  at  Cornwall,   hearing  of  the  defeat  of  his  colleague,  retired  to 
Salmon   River,  and  fortified  himself.     The  victory   at  Chateauguay  permitted  the 
Earon  de  Rottenburg,  and  afterwards  Sir  Gordon  Drummond,  his  successor  in  com- 
mand, to  resume  the  offensive  in   Upper  Canada.     Great  Britain  commemorated  the 
victory  by  causing  a  gold  medal  to  be   struck  ;  the  Voltigeurs  were  presented    with 
colors,  ornamented  with  devices  ;  and  DeSalaberry,    beside  the  gold  medal,  had  the 
Order  of  the  Bath  conferred  upon  him,  transmitted  with  an  autograph  letter  from  His 
Royal  Highness  the  Prince  Regent.      The  two  Houses  of  the  Provincial  Legislature 
passed  a  vote   of  thanks    to  him.     The  Voltigeurs  took  part  in  the  second  victory 
obtained  at  LacoUe,  in  March,  181 4.     DeSalaberry  laid  down  tiie  sword  for  the  pen. 
He  became  a  Senator,  being  called  to  the  Legislative  Council  in    18 18,  at  the  same 
time  as  Bishop  Plessis.     He  died  at   Chambly,  on  the  26th  February,   1829,  aged 
fifty-one  years  ;  and  was  buried  in  the  new  church  at  that  place,  which  was  erected 
in  the  room  of  the  one   destroyed  by  fire   in  1806.      DeSalaberry  is  represented  in 
his  likeness  attired  in  the  uniform  worn  by  the  Voltigeurs  decorated  with  the  Chateau- 
guay medal  and  the  Cross  of  the  Bath,  with  his  sword  under  his  arm.     His  family 
crest  is  also  seen.     The  escutcheon  of  our  compatriot  bears  the  motto  becoming  to 
the  par/ait  chevalier  :    '  Force  d  superbs;   merci  a.  faible.''      A  medallion  repre-

seating  a  battle  in  the  woods.  On  tiie  trunk  of  a  tree,  reversed,  is  written  :  '  Clia- 
teauguay,  26th  October,  1813.'  A  serpent  biting  his  tail,  symbol  of  iinmortaHty, 
encircles  the  medal.  With  respect  to  the  English  medal  at  Chateauguay,  Britannia 
is  seen  bearing  a  palm  in  hand,  crowning  a  lion  at  her  feet.  On  the  reverse  is 
engraved  Chateauguay." 

A  fine  monument  has  been  erected  at  Chambly  to  his  memory,  at  the  unveiling 
of  which  Col.  Harwood  made  one  of  the  finest  speeches  ever  delivered  in  Canada. 

JUDGE  VINCESLAS  I'AUL  WILFRED  DORION 

Was  born  on  the  2nd  October,  1827  ;  '^^^  ^^-  Anne  La  Perade,  in  the  District  ofThree 
Rivers.      He  was  the  son  of  the  late  Pierre  Antoine  Dorion,  a  merchant  of  the  place, 
and  an  ex-M.P.  for  tlie  County  of  Champlain  before  the  troubles  of  1837.    ^^'^  mother's 
name  was  Genevieve  Bureau.     He  went  to  a  common  school  at  an  early  age,  and  it 
is  greatly   to  his  credit  liow  he  advanced  in  his  profession,    that  he  never  received 
a  collegiate  education,  but  is  really  a  self-taught  and  self-made  man.     At  the  age  of 
thirteen  he  entered  a  country  store  as  junior  clerk.     He  came  to  -\[ontreal  in  May, 
1842,  and  remained   tiiree  years   in  Messrs.   Fabre   &amp;  Gravel's  book  store  as  their 
assistant.     Determined  to  enter  a  profession  he  chose  that    of  the  Law,  and  in  ALiy^ 
1845,  he  began  to  study.     For  some  years  he  studied  iiard,  and  at  the    end  of  his 
studies  was   admitted  to  tiie  Bar  in  June,  1850.     He   then  entered  into  partnership 
with  C.  S.    Cherrier,    Esq.,    Q-C,    and    his    brother,      Sir    A.    A.   Dorion,  the   late 
Chief  Justice.     He  took  an  active  part  in  the  foundation  of  tlie  Institiit  Canadien  of 
Montreal,  and  filled  successively  nearly  all  the  offices  in  the  Society,  including  the  Presi- 
dency, to  which  high  position  lie  was  unanimously  elected.  He  was  one  of  the  collabora- 
tors of  Z'/^7^^«//',  and  for  several  years  co-proprietor  oi\\\Q.  Fays  with  C.  F.  Papineau, 
Esq.,  N.  P.,  until  the  pai)cr  was  merged  into  the  Printing  and  Publishing  Company 
of  Canada.  He  was  moderate  but  firm  in  his  ]iolitical  convictions,  and  a  true  Liberal. 
He  had  taken  part  in    nearly  all   political  and  electoral  contests  since  the  Hon.  L. 
Papineau  was  nominated  by  the  Liberal  Parly  as  their  candidate  for  ^LJntreal  in  the 
winter  of  1851-52.     He  had  for  several  times  held  the  high  position  of  Member  of  the 
Council  of  the  Bar  of  Montreal.   In  t866,  when  his  brother,  J.  ]&gt;.  E.  Dorion,  Esq.,  mem- 
ber for  Drummond  and  Artliabaska,  died,  he  was  offered  the  candidature  of  these  two 
large  constituencies.    Considering,  however,  that  general  elections  would  soon  be  held 
under  the  Confederation    Act,   he  declined,   in  order  not  to  submit  the  counties  to  a 
second  election  within  so  short  a  time. 

When  the  General  Elections  took  place  he  was  asked  to  stand  for  the  County  of 
Chambly  and  also  for  Drummond  and  Artliabaska.  He  was  very  reluctant  to  accept 
either  on  account  of  his  professional  business,  but  the  elections  being  considered  so 
important,  he  ran  for  Chambly  for  the  Federal  House,  and  Drummond  and  Artha- 
baska  for  the  Local.  Not  having  been  able  to  attend  either  the  nomination  or  votation 
in  Drummond  and  Arthabaska,  he  was  defeated  by  a  very  small  majority,  and 
his  co-candidate,  Mr.  Senecal,  was  returned.  He  was  raised  to  the  Bench  some 
time  after  this,  and  died  some  years  ago  in  Montreal.

II.  C.  ST.    I'IKRRK,  Q.C. 

'I'liK  siiljjccl  (jf  this  sketch  was  l)oru  at  St.  Madeloine  ilc  Kigaud,  I3lh  Scptcinbcr, 
i&lt;S42.  His  father,  Joseph  St.  Pierre,  •' cullivaleiir,"  having  died  wlien  he  was  not 
nuich  more  tiian  two  years  of  age,  C.  Raymond,  merchant  of  Isle  Bizard,  took  charge 
ol  the  child  and  reared  him  as  Iiis  own  son.  At  the  age  of  twelve  years  lie  entered 
the  College  of  Montreal,  where  he  passed  through  all  his  sludics  with  success.  In 
iS6j,  he  left  the  College,  and  the  young  student,  as  his  temperament  shows  even  at 
this  present  day,  full  of  energy  and  vim,  wi^^hed  to  enter  the  Army  of  the  Northern 
States.  Tlie  War  of  Secession  was  in  all  its  fury,  but  the  wish  of  his  friends  and  [)ro- 
lectors  was  against  it. 

Jjv  the  death  of  his  j^rotector  he  had  to  launch  out  on  life's  journey  by  himself. 
Thus,  we  find  him  at  this  time  in  Kingston,  Ontario,  studying  Law  in  the  office  of 
tlie  Well-known  James  Agnew,  I'lscp  As  soon  as  he  passed  his  e.vaminalions  he 
returned  to  the  Slates  and  enlisted  in  the  y^ih  New  \(.rk  Volunteers,  which  tormed 
pan  of  the  Army  of  the  Potomac,  and  was  sent  to  the  from.  In  two  months  he  became 
Sergeant.  At  the  retreat  of  General  Mead  he  received  a  wound,  and  again  receiving 
a  woimd  at  Mine  Rim,  near  l''rederi(-ksburg,  which  stretched  him  on  the  bailie  fukl, 
he  was  taken  prisoner  of  war  by  the  enemy's  cavalry  and  transported  to  Gordonsvilie, 
not  far  from  Richmond,  the  Capital.  So  it  came  to  [lass  that  his  name  was  recorded  in 
the  battle  roll  as  slain  on  the  field  of  honor.  A  funeral  service  was  even  celebrated 
for  him  in  the  Montreal  College  and  in  St.  Madeleine,  his  native  place.  It  would  be 
long  to  enumerate  all  the  sufferings  which  he  endured  during  thirteen  months  in  thedif- 
tercnl  military  prisons  where  he  was  confined,  but  by  the  evacuation  of  Charleston  by 
liie  .\rmy  of  the  South  in  1S65.  heat  last  attained  his  liberty.  Pen  cannot  describe  the 
joy,  the  pleasure,  the  delight  when  he  once  more  appeared  in  his  native  land  by  his 
parents,  by  his  friends  and  by  the  community  at  large,  who  had  so  long  thought  him 
dead  and  Ijuried  on  an  American  battle  field.  In  1866,  having  been  admitted  to  the 
study  of  his  jMofessicjii,  he  was  successively  in  the  offices  of  .Messrs.  Cartier,  Pominville 
t\:  Ijetournay,  F.  X.  .\.  Trudel  and  J.  J.  C.  .-Vbbott,  and  in  July,  1870,  he  was  admitted 
10  the  IJar  of  the  Province  of  Quebec.  In  1871,  he  was  associated  with  the  Hon.

handle,   neverdieless   two  were  aciiuitted  and    the   third  was  pronounced  guilty  of 
assault  on  tlie  1  erson.     He  received  an  enthusiastic  ovation  at  the  conclusion  of  the 
trial.     Many    others   accused  of  murder  have    been    ac(piitted  by  his   indefatigable 
means.     One  of  the  most   notable  trials  was  that  of  f'errari,  an  Italian,  who  stabbed 
to  the  heart  another  countryman.      In   this  trial  Mr.  Si.  I'ierre  was  ably  seconded  by 
Mr.  Donald  McMaster,  one  of   the  brightest  lights  now  of  the  Montreal  liar.     The 
accused  was  acrjuitted.     Again,  a  brilliant  manifestation  was  given  to  Mr.  Si.  Pierre

SAMl'SOX    1'.    RiJlilNS,    M.A,    I,l-.l)., 

Was  born  at  f'eversham,  CouuiV  of  K.e;)t,  Iviglaiul,  2G1U  January.  rS?_^.  His 
father  was  the  Rev.  Paul  Robins,  Mmister  of  the  IJible  Christian  Ciiurcli,  and 
Ann  N'icker  (a  good  old  Welsh  l-'-iiglish  name)  was  his  wife.  They  are  an  old 
Cornw.ill  family,  tliough  his  mother  originally  hails  from  the  Trincipality  of 
Wales.  He  came  to  Canada  in  1846  with  his  parents,  they  settling  at  I'eter- 
borough,  Ont.  Here  he  had  the  good  f)rtune  to  come  under  the  notice  of  the 
Rev.  K.  C.  Taylor,  the  Rector  of  the  i'arish  and  Head  Master  of  ilie  (Irammar 
Sciiool.  Like  the  Writer  of  this  sketch,  he  began  teiching  at  sixteen  years  of 
age.  He  was  a  born  educator,  and  at  this  ag.-  taught  his  first  school  in  the 
Township  of  Drummond,  County  of  Victoria,  Onl.  i''iom  this  place  he  removed  to 
Northumberland,  where  he  taught  three  years. 

In  1S51,  Mr.  Robins  went  to  Toronto  and  entered  as  a  pupil  in  the  Normal 
School.  After  teaching  in  this  school  and  the  Motlel  School  for  more  than  three 
years,  he  was  appointed  Head  Master  of  the  Central  School  of  the  Town  of  Urant- 
ford. 

When  the  Normal  School  was  established  in  Montreal  in  1.S57,  Mr.  Robins 
removed  to  the  Metropolis  to  become  one  of  the  Professors  in  that  institution,  and 
he  continued  to  fill  that  position  for  the  next  thirteen  years.  Meantime  he  con- 
nected himself  with  the  .\rts  Course  of  Mc(iill  University,  did  double  work  while  an 
undergraduate,  and  was  made  J5..'\.  in  1863,  and  M.A.  in  1868.  The  degree  of 
LL.D.  was  given  him  from  his  Alma  Mater  in  1880.  Dr.  Robins  is  a  first-class 
mathematician,  and  came  to  Montreal  as  the  Professor  of  Mathematics  in  the  Normal 
School.  He  has  been  Superintendent  of  the  Protestant  Schools  of  Montreal.  He 
is  one  of  our  most  energetic  and  well-known  teachers,  and  as  an  educator  has  not 
his  equal  in  the  Province.  A  year  or  two  ago  he  was  appointed  the  Principal  of  the 
Protestant  Normal  School,  a  position  which  he  richly  deserved  for  his  long  series  of 
labors  in  the  cause  of  education  in  the  Province  of  Quebec.  The  Protestant  Schools 
under  the  control  of  the  School  Commissioners  of  Montreal  give  a  great  deal  of  their 
advancement,  usefulness  and  reputation  to  his  ever  fostering-care.  His  able  and 
zealous  exertions  in  the  cause  of  education  can  never  be  surpassed. 

He  married,  in  1834,  Miss  Elizabeth  Hore,  of  Camborne,  Ont,,  but  she  died  in 
1867.     He  again  married,  in  1871,  Miss  Jane  Dougall,  of  Montreal.     Mrs,  Robins 


356  GAZEITKER  t)F  MONTREAL. 

deserves  a  jiassing  remark.  She  was  at  llic  time  of  lier  marriage  a  teacher  in  the  city, 
and  one  of  the  best  in  Montreal.  .She  luul  a  remarkable  forte  for  Malhematies  and 
occult  sciences,  but  it  is  presumed,  like  many  others,  her  children  and  household 
cares  have  prevented  her  from  advancing  still  further  in  those  branches  in  which 
she  had  excelled. 

Dr.  Robins  is  a  member  of  the  Methodist  Church,  and  has  been  an  office  bearer 
in  that  Christian  body  for  nearly  forty  years.  He  is  a  class  leader  and  local  jjreacher, 
and  as  untiring  in  his  religious  duties  as  he  has  ever  been  in  his  educational.  Some 
of  his  children  are,  like  their  father  and  mother,  born  teachers.  If  a  general  Protes- 
tant Superintendent  of  all  the  schools  in  (Quebec  Prcnince,  and  of  all  the  Inspectors 
of  those  schools,  should,  as  it  is  intended,  be  ai)pointed,  no  man  is  more  fitted  to 
fill  the  position  than  Dr.  Robins,  antl  Uie  (Government  will  do  well  to  appoint  him, 
leaving  all  considcnUions  of  class  or  pijlitics,  as  the  right  man  in  the  right  jjlace. 

JOSEPH    FROni.^llER 

Was  one  of  those  who  in  the  winter  of  17S3-4.  wi:h  .Simon  Mc'l'avish.  formed  what 
has  been  known  in  Canadian  History  as  the  "  Xorth-W'est  Comjiany."  He  was  the 
first  to  proceed  to  the  great  unknown  AVest,  and  went  as  far  as  the  Churchill  River. 
Up  to  1774,  all  the  Imlians  of  that  vast  region  were  accustomed  to  carrv  their  fuis 
to  the  Hudsons  Bay.  Mr.  Frobisher  meeting  several  bands  of  Indians  on  the  way 
thither  induced  them  to  trade  with  him.  He  lemained  two  years  in  the  countr\-, 
enduring  great  hardships,  but  established  a  firm  tnule  with  the  Ri:d  Men.  He  re- 
turned in  1776,  and  during  these  two  years,  so  plentiful  were  the  furs  in  those  days, 
and  bought  on  such  advantageous  terms,  that  when  he  arrived  in  Montieal  lie  had 
scctired  what  was  at  that  time  counted  a  competency.  His  brother  lienjamin,  who 
died  in  1787,  travelled  even  further  West,  antl  was  the  lirst  white  man  who  ever 
reached  ''  Isle  a  la  Croix." 

In  1798,  Joseph  retired  from  commercial  life.  He  had  come  from  England,  and 
with  James  McClill  was  a  vestryman  of  what  was  then  called  the  '•  I'rotestant  Con- 
gregation of  Montreal."  This  afterwards  became  Christ  Cluirch,  erected  in  Notre 
Dame  street,  and  burned  down.  Ii  is  now  the  I'.nglish  Cathedral  in  St.  Catherine 
street.  He  and  John  Richardson  represented  the  Mast  Ward  of  Montreal  in  the 
very  first  Parliament  of  Lower  Canada  in  1792.  His  son  represented  St.  Laurent 
District  in  1804. 

With  John  Gray,  Daniel  Sutherland  and  several  others,  he  formed  the  first  Com- 
])any,  in  1801,  to  construct  water  works  for  the  city.  Lie  received  a  grant  of  no  less 
than  X  1.550  acres  of  land  from  Governor  Milncs  in  1802.  This  property  was  situ- 
ated in  the  Township  of  Ireland,  and  in  the  next  Township  a  hill  to  this  day  is 
called  '■  Lrobisher  Hill."  He  built  a  fine  large  residence  and  called  it  "  Jieaver 
Hall,"  after  the  way  he  had  made  his  fortune.  It  was  burnt  down  in  1847,  but  the 
name  will  ever  remain  as  at  this  day  in  that  part  of  Montreal,  "  Beaver  Hall  Hill."

HON.   LOUIS  ADELARl)   SEXHCAL. 

His  ancestors  came  from  l-'rance,  his  father  being  a  farmer  in  County  of  Vercheres, 
P.(1&gt;.  Born  at  \'arennes,  loth  July,  1829,  and  educated  there  and  in  r)Urlington, 
U.S.,  he  married,  in  1850,  Delpliine,  daughter  of  I-ieut. -Colonel  Dansereau,  merchant, 
Vercheres.  He  was  Commander  of  the  Legion  d'Honneur,  France.  He  was  a 
Mnancier  and  President  of  the  Richelieu  and  Diitaiio  Navigation  Company,  was 
Genera!  Superintendent  of  the  Government  Railways  of  the  Province  of  (Quebec, 
and  ['resident  of  the  North  Shore  kailway  and  of  the  Montreal  (.ity  Passenger  Kail- 
way.  He  opened  to  navigation,  in  1857,  the  Yamaska  River,  between  Sore!  and  St. 
Aime,  and  the  St..  Francis  River  between  Sorel  and  St.  I-'rancis.  He  constructed 
the  Richelieu,  Drummond  and  Arthabaska  Railway,  now  a  portion  of  the  South 
Eastern  Railway;  the  Laurentian  Railway,  from  St.  Therese  to  St.  Lin;  the  St.

was  one  of  the  greatest  wonders  of  modern  railroading  and  the  constant  object  of 
interest  to  natives  as  well  as  strangers,  viz.,  the  Ice  Railway  on  th'"  St.  Lawrence, 
from  Montreal  to  Longueuil.  He  sat  in  the  (-ommons  for  Dnmimoiul  and  Artha-

WILLIAM  CHRISTIAN  MUNDERLOII, 

C.l-.RMAN    CONSUL. 

He  was  born  in  Elsflelh,  Grand  Duchy  of  Oldenburg,  (lerma'iy,  on  8lh  September, 
1831.  His  fatiier's  name  was  Heinrich  .N[Linderloh  and  Iiis  moilier's  Mela  von  Liencn. 
In  the  year  1847,  ^'^^  ^'^^^  '^'^  liirtliplace  for  Bremen,  wliere  h;;  served  four  years  as 
ap])rentice  in  a  dry  goods  iiouse.  He  remained  till  1857  •'^  Bremen,  occupying  the 
position  as  clerk  in  a  dry  goods  establishment. 

In  the  -pring  of  1857,  he  was  fortunate  in  obtaining  an  engagement  as  clerk  in  a 
Montreal  wholesale  dry  goods  house,  and  arrived  on  15th  June  same  year,  and 
on  the  following  day  entered  his  new  position,  which  he  held  for  about  three  years. 
He  was  two  years  the  traveller,  which  gave  him  an  excellent  opportunity  of  getting 
a  thorough  knowledge  of  what  was  then  called  Ui)per  and  Lower  Canada,  and  was 
convinced  thai  the  possibilities  of  Canada,  were  very  great,  and  liking  the  country 
and  its  inhabitants  very  much,  he  made  up  his  mind  to  make  Canada  his  adopted 
country. 

]5efore  he  left  (Germany  he  had  promised  his  aged  father  that  he  would  return 
in  about  three  years,  and  consequently  lie  sailed  from  Portland  in  the  fall  of  i860,  and 
reached  his  native  i)lace  jusl  in  time  to  meet  his  father  once  more  alive,  as  he  died 
in  January,  i86[. 

He  again  started  for  Canada  in  the  same  year,  and  shortly  after  commenced 
business  (wholesale  dry  goods)  on  his  own  account  3  but  irni)orting  dry  goods  from 
the  Continent  at  that  time  did  not  offer  sufficient  scope  to  extend  his  business,  and  as 
he  saw  a  fair  chance  in  t'le  shipping  between  Canada  and  the  Continent  of  Kurope, 
he  endeavored  to  add  that  branch  to  his  importing  business,  it  was  uphill  work  and 
a  difhcult  role  In  fill  a  lew  sailing-vessels  with  Canadian  goods,  but  the  commence- 
ment was  mnde,  and  he  had  the  satisfaction  to  see  that  four  or  five  ships  were  con- 
signed to  his  firm.  IJy  perseverance  the  trade  developed  considerably,  so  that  he  could 
safely  recommend  to  his  friends  in  Antwerp  the  adoption  of  sending  a  few  steamers 
instead  of  sailing-vessels  to  Montreal.  His  advice  was  taken,  and  soon  sailirg-vessels 
were  abandoned  and  steamers  took  their  ])lace  ;  but  the  service  was  not  regidar. 
Only  when  the  Dominion  Government  came  to  his  assistance  in  granting  a  moderate 
subsidy,  he  succeeded  in  eslablishing  a  fortnightly  line.  On  recommendation  of  the 
late  large-hearted  and  patriotic  Premier,  Sir  John  A.  Macdonald,  he  was  enabled  to 
close  a  contract  with  the  Dominion  Government  for  five  years  ;  but  at  the  end  of  five 
years  there  was  no  need  of  renewing  the  contract,  as  the  trade  between  Canada  and  the 
Continent  of  lMiro])e  had  sufticienlly  developed  to  carry  on  a  regular  Steamshij)  Line 
without  Government  assistance.  'I'he  Hansa  Line  Steamship  Company  of  Hamburg 
with  nine  first-class  steamships,  most  of  them  built  during  the  last  three  years 
ex[)ressly  for  the  ('anadian  trade,  have  given  abundant  proof  that  it  was  a  wise  step 
on  the  jiart  of  the  (iovernment  to  foster  the  trade  between  Canada  and  the  Continent 
of  Kurope  in  the  way  indicated,  and  that  Mr.  Munderloh's  conception  regarding  the 


GAZETTEER    OF    MONTREAL.  359 

possibilities  of  Canada  was  correct.  Nearly  every  week  during  the  navigation  of 
the  St.  Lawrence  a  steamer  loaded  with  Canadian  producls  sails  from  Montreal  to 
Hamburg  and  other  continental  ports,  and  during  the  summer  season  llie  (rerman 
flag  can  now  be  seen  in  our  port  every  day,  indicating  that  Canada  extends  her  trade 
with  foreign  nations  and  the  great  continental  ])owers  of  the  German  Emi)ire. 

In  the  year  187 1,  he  was  ai)poinled  Imperial  German  (Consul  at  Montreal  by 
His  Majesty  the  late  I'aiiperor  William,  who,  after  he  had  filled  the  honorary  office  for 
nearly  fifteen  years,  was  pleased  to  decorate  him  with  the  Crown  Order  (Golden 
Cross).  He  holds  the  oftice  up  to  the  present  date,  and  has  served  during  llie  life  of 
three  iMnperors  of  (^icrmany,  viz:  William  I.  ['"rederick,  and  William  II,  the  present 
Emperor. 

For  years  he  has  been  President  of  the  German  Ijcnevolenl.  Society  of  this  city, 
and  holds  this  position  at  the  jjresent  lime. 

He  has  fre([uenlly  served  on  the  Council  of  the  Montreal  IJoard  of  Trade,  and 
was  appointed  again  to  that  important  ])osilion  at  the  last  general  election.  He 
married  a  Montreal  lady,  a  daughter  of  the  house  of  lilaekadder,  a  name  once  very 
familiar  in  McMitreal,  but  like  some  of  our  old  English  and  Scotch  names  gradually 
dying  out,  or  only  perpetuated  in  the  daughters,  with,  their  cliangcd  mairicd  names. 
He  has  two  sons  and  one  daughter,  and  is  a  well-known  alteiulaiu  in  Cri.'.;ci'nt

■■  .\.M()Nc.  the  many  proofs  of  Montreal's  greatness  as  a  c)mm  }rcial  centre  none  are 
more  often  cpiolel,  and  rightly  so,  than  that  of  the  extensive  and  tlourishing  Keal 
Instate  business  done  here.  Many  i)rominent  merchants  are  engaged  in  this  pmsuil, 
and  it  is  needless  to  say  that  to  succeed  well,  in  this  progressive  age,  as  a  Real  Estate 
dealer,  a  man  must  be  wide-awake  and  of  superior  judgment  and  ability  :  among 
these  are  Messrs.  Hutchins  &lt;!v:  Brown,  the  well-known  Real  Estate  and  Financial 
Agents  of  this  city.  The  senior  partner  of  this  tirm  was  one  of  the  oldest  merchants 
in  this  city,  and  has  been  engaged  in  his  present  line  of  business  for  the  last  fifteen 
years  or  more.  His  well-established  reputation,  coupled  with  his  extensive  opera- 
lions,  has  brought  his  firm  to  the  front  and  rendered  their  enterprise  conspicuous."' 
Mr.  Hutchins  has  seen  very  many  changes  in  Montreal  the  past  forty  years,  and  to- 
day he  is  busily  engaged  in  his  profession  in  developing  the  city  and  extending  its 
area  by  the  sale  of  subiirban  lots,  and  thus  en.ibling  the  mechanic  and  the  middle 
class  to  own  their  own  homestead  and  breathe  the  fresh  air  of  Heaven.

EDMUND  ROBII,LARD,,  M.D., 

Was  born  30th  Octol&gt;cr,  1S25.  Kis  father  was  Joseph  Robillard,  and  his  mother 
Rose  Aussem,  lioth  belonging  to  ancient  faniih'es  of  Montreal.  His  father  was  one 
of  tile  oldest  officers  of  the  Montreal  Corporation. 

After  his  classical  education  he  studied  widi  Dr.  Wolfred  Nelson,  in  October, 
1842,  and  continued  till  1846,  during  which  time  he  also  attended  the  course  of  the 
Canadian  Medical  School,  of  which  he  was  appointed,  yet  a  student,  Demonstrator 
of  Anatomy. 

Admitted  to  practise  i6tli  November,  1846,  he  was  ai)pointed  one  of  the  Medical 
attendants  in  tlic  Quarantine  of  Grosse  Isle  in  the  summer  of  1847,  during  the  ship 
fever.  He  also  became  a  member  of  the  Medical  College  of  Physicians  and  Surgeons 
of  Canada.  In  the  fall  of  1847,  he  left  for  New  York,  where  he  continued  iiis  sur- 
gical studies  under  the  celebrated  Dr.  Robert  Nelson,  one  of  the  greatest  surgeons 
of  his  time.  In  1848,  Dr.  Rnbillard  was  appointed  Surgeon  of  the  N.Y.  iS:  Krie  R.K. 
while  in  construction.  Sul)se(piently  lie  went  to  Paris  to  attend  the  courses  of  the 
different  Medical  Faculties  during  the  years  1849-1850,  after  which  he  returned  to 
resume  his  duties  on  the  N.Y.  iS:  Erie  R.R.  as  Surgeon. 

On  his  way  back  on  board  the  Packet  ll'^ater/00,  Dr.  Robillard  as  Surgeon  of 
the  ship  established  so  strict  a  sanitary  cordon  that,  though  tiie  cholera  was  at  the 
time  raging  in  Liverpool,  not  one  of  the  passengers  was  sick  during  the  passage.  Dr. 
Robillard  received  a  complimentary  address  from  the  passengers  on  the  arrival  of 
the  ship  at  New  York.  He  was  forced  to  leave  the  United  States  in  about  two  years 
or  so  in  consequence  of  sickness  whicli  was  contracted  during  his  surgical  operations  in 
the  West,  and  then  returned  to  Canada.  He  was  appointed  in  1854  one  of  the  Surgeons 
of  the  G.  T.  R.  R.  Contractors  during  the  construction  of  the  Victoria  Bridge  for 
the  space  of  eight  years,  in  the  course  of  which  time  he  had  opportunities  to  perform 
many  of  the  most  remarkable  operations  of  surgery,  very  honorably  mentioned  in  the 
work  of  Mr.  Hodges  on  the  Victoria  IJridgc.  His  post  being  at  Pointe  Claire,  the 
people  of  the  locality  elected  him  first  the  Mayor  and  afterwards  he  was  the  Warden 
of  the  County  of  Jacques  Cartier. 

In  the  fall  of  1854,  he  married  Miss  Adeline  Loranger,  sister  of  the  Judges,  Priest 
and  Lawyer  of  the  same  name.  In  1859,  he  was  elected  by  the  members  of  the 
College  of  Surgeons  and  Doctors  of  Canada  one  of  the  Governors  and  Examiners. 

From  1868  to  1874  he  was  the  Registrar  of  the  College.  Dr.  Robillard  has  a 
Diploma  of  the  Medical  College  of  Philadelphia.  He  is  also  a  member  of  the  Cana- 
dian Medical  Association  of  the  Dominion  since  1868,  and  was  its  treasurer  in  1870. 
In  1873,  the  Bishop's  College  of  Lennoxville  conferred  upon  him  the  honorary  title 
oi  Ad  EiiHiicm,  being  a  spontaneous  confirmation  of  his  Diploma.  He  now  resides

J.  C.   WILvSON. 


GAZKTTKKR    OF    MONTKKAL.  36I 

J.  C.  WILSON,  M.  P. 

The  contents  of  this  skctcli  arc  principally  taken  from  a  succinct  bii)grai)hy  wrilicn  for 
one  of  the  most  inllucnlial  nc\vs[)apcrs  in  the  North  of  Ireland  (Ulster).  What  the 
Irish  paper  declares  is  well  borne  out  in  Montreal  by  all  who  know  Mr.  Wilson.  A 
man  of  progress,  development  and  push,  he  has  stayed  at  nothing  which  will  in  iiis 
business  advance  tiie  interests  of  his  adopted  city  and  country.  The  inhabitants  of 
Lachule  and  neighborhood  have  much  to  thank  Mr.  Wilson  for,  that  he  has  established 
such  an  extensive  industry  in  their  midst,  and  tleveloped  their  locality  to  such  an 
extent,  that  the  manufactured  paper  of  this  mill  is  well  known  in  the  l-'-nglish  I'.mpire. 
He  has  been  one  of  the  most  intelligent  and  i)raise\vorthy  merchants  of  Montreal, 
remembering  always  the  city  of  his  adoption. 

'•  Mr.  Wilson  was  born  in  the  County  .Vntrim,  near  the  town  of  Kasharkin,  in 
US41,  and  his  family  came  soon  after  to  Canada.  The  elder  ^[r.  Wilson  was  what 
is  known  in  Ireland  as  a  'handyman,'  and  could  use  carpenter's  tools  lo  good 
advantage.  He  was  by  these  means  enabled  to  secure  a  position  as  pattern  maker  in 
St.  Mary's  Foundry,  Montreal,  at  which  occupation  he  gave  great  satisfaction,  and 
succeeded  in  proving  the  old  saw,  '  Where  there's  a  will  there's  a  way.'  When 
only  twelve  years  of  age  the  subject  of  our  present  sketch  was  apprenticed  to  learn 
the  trade  of  a  machinist.  His  inclination  ran  in  the  line  of  mechanics  (snme  tools 
made  by  him  when  he  was  fourteen  years  of  age  he  is  prt)ud  of  exhibiting),  but  he 
met  with  a  severe  accident  which  prevented  him  from  completing  his  specified  term. 
Through  the  influence  and  sympathy  of  kind  friends,  he  was  placed  in  McGill  Normal 
School  in  this  city.  He  was  not  long  in  this  establishment  until  he  gave  practical 
assurance  to  his  benefactors  that  the  money  invested  in  his  education  was  not  thrown 
away;  for  he  graduated,  and  received  a  diploma  for  teaching  in  1S59,  and  became 
teacher  of  the  Beauharnois  Dissentient  School,  over  which  he  successfully  presided 
for  three  years.  At  this  time  he  began  lo  realize  the  fact,  "Once  a  teacher,  always 
a  teacher."  He  saw  that  his  duties  as  preceptor  did  not  afford  him  sufficient  scope 
for  his  latent  energies,  the  exercise  of  which  he  desired  should  result  in  financial 
success.  With  this  in  view  he  went  West  and  accepted  a  position  in  a  bookstore  in 
the  town  of  J5elleville,  in  Ontario,  where  he  remained  for  some  time,  gaining  that 
insight  into  the  trade  which  enabled  him  to  claim  a  higher  position  in  more  extensive 
houses.  His  patience  and  energy  were  soon  rewarded  by  the  offer  of  a  position  in 
a  large  [)ublishing  and  newspajjcr  house  in  Toronto,  which  he  accepted.  'Onward' 
and  '  Excelsior '  were  still  his  mottoes,  and  in  the  fall  of  1863  he  went  to  New  Vork, 
and  was  not  long  in  obtaining  a  position  in  the  publishing  house  of  T.  W.  Strong. 
Here  again  his  indefatigable  perseverance  asserted  itself.  Encountering  many  difti- 
cullies  such  as  a  peculiar  mode  of  doing  business,  and  the  difference  in  surround- 
ings, he  fought  against  all  odds,  and  by  strict  and  careful  application  to  business,  he 
attracted  the  attention  of  the  head  of  the  firm,  and  his  untiring  efforts  in  his  interest 
resulted  in  his  eventually  assuming  the  responsible  position  of  manager  of  the  entire 
concern.  '  '~'         "     '"     ~~'

"  lie  remained  in  New  York  until  he  married  (Mrs.  \\'ils()ii  is  a  (Canadian  lady), 
when  the  love  of  home  surronndings  recalled  him  to  Montreal.  In  1S67,  he  entt-rcd 
the  employment  of  Annus,  l,ogan  and  Com|)any,  wholesale  stationers  anrl  jiaper 
manufacturers  (now  the  Canada  Paper  Company)  as  their  l)ookkeei)er.  After  remain- 
ing three  years  and  a  half  in  that  position  his  old  time  energy  again  asserted  itself, 
and  he  concluded  by  making  a  venture  on  his  account.  With  the  assistance  of  his 
employers  he  started  a  Paper  Hag  Factory,  in  which  were  maniiractured  s'.iccessfully 
the  J/'/s/  machineniide  paper  bags  that  were  placed  on  the  market  in  all  Canada. 
Tin:  business  was  a  success  from  its  inception,  and  continued  to  be  a  succi'ss,  nnd  the 
assistance  reiuii'red  to  Mr.  Wilson  by  his  immediate  former  employers  was  soon 
repaid,  and  their  kindness  reciprocated  in  a  practical  manner,  foi'  he  became  one  of 
their  largest  and  best  customers. 

"  It  is  ciiaracteristic  of  the  i)vesent  age  that  men  are  ever  on  the  alert  to  inlroduce 
some  idea  into  \ery  old  existing  princi|)les  of  action.  At  the  head  of  most  success- 
ful maiuifacturiiig  eiiterjirises  do  we  find  praclic.d  men  of  experimental  tuiii,  who  .ire 
constantly  endeavoring  to  sccairi'  here  a  little,  and  there  a  little  gain  on  tlie  difiiculties

n.uioii.il  ciueipiises  to  be  buoyed  up  against  the  difficulties  wiiii  which  they  have  to 
contend. 

'•  Mr.  Wilson  started  first  on  what  may  be  justly  termed  a,n  infant  scale.  .At  the 
outsL't  two  tlats  of  a  building  were  sulficienl,  but  these  in  a  short  time  were  found  to 
be  too  iimileil  to  meet  the  demands  of  an  exlensisely  increasing  trade,  and  it  thus 
became  necessary  to  -^ecure  more  room  from  time  to  time  until  the  block  of  buildings 
of  tlie^e  stores  with  sjx  il.its  each  wrre  sei'ured.  in  18S0.  Mr.  Wilson  foiiml  his 
paper  and  juper  bag  tradi,'  so  extensive,  and  his  reipiirements  so  great  that  they 
could  11  »t  be  salisfactorilv  nn't  by  the  outside  paper  mills,  and  it  became  nec.ess.iry 
that  he  should  have  a  m.inufactory  entirely  under  his  control.  With  this  object  in 
view  he  selected  Lachute.  a  small  town  within  an  hour  .and  twenty  minutes'  ride  by 
rail  from  .Montreal,  on  the  CaiKulian  Pacific  Railway,  as  the  most  convenient  site  for 
his  pro|)osed  operations.  Here,  ii])on  an  excellent  water-power,  he  erected  a  mill, 
and  eipiipped  it  with  all  the  latest  antl  in)^t  im|)roved  machinery.  I''ive  years  later 
the  trade  had  grown  to  great  proportions,  and  a  larger  turn  out  of  paper  was  recpiii'ed 
to  meet  the  new  ilemands.  Another  mill  was  ere&lt;:ted  adjoining  the  lirst.  In  point 
of  architecture  these  structures  are  both  s(jlid  and  ornamental,  being  built  of  stone, 
with  cut-stone  Iriiiunings.  and  otherwise  exhibiting  the  most  elaborate  modern  garnish, 
'i'he  cost  of  thc^e  buildings  reaches  .^175, 000,  and  by  the  emplo3'menl  of  about 
seventy-five  ex|)eit  hands,  they  turn  out  seven  tons  of  i)aper  daily. 

"  .\fter  the  mills  had  been  doubled,  the  trade  of  the  fact  )ry  and  warehouses  in 
Montre.d,  founded  in  1S70,  had  grown  to  such  an  extent  that  the  three  stores  of  six 
tlats  each  woie  found  insufficient  to  contain  the  machinery,  or  the  employees  necess.uy 
to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  fast  growing  trade;  and,  finding  that  the  dimensions 
of  the    ])uilding    could    not  i)e    increased,    .Mr.    Wilson   resolved  to    construct    f)ne

acquired  a  number  of  houses  on  Western  Craii;'  street,  pulled  them  down,  and  raised 
a  magnificenl  eii^ht-story  slruclure^certaiidy  the  most  imposing;  upon  that  ihoiou^di-

"  In  the  interest  of  the  business  there  are  eighteen  travellers  constantly  on  the 
road,  covering  the  territoi'v  from  Newfoundland  to  Hritish  Columbia.  'I'he  extent 
of  commercial  dealings  may  be  estimated  at  above  half  a   million   dollars  annually.

for  this  work,  it  is  called  "  Ville  Marie;  or,  Skete/ies  of  Montreal,  l\isf  and

I  believe,  now  lives  in  Toronto,  and  has  become  a  painter  of  good  repute.  His  work 
of  1870  is  now  getting  scarce,  and  commanding  a  higher  price  than  that  at  which  it

'IMIOMAS  PORTllOUS 

Was  one  of  the  early  English  merchants  of  Montreal.  Removing  from  Terrebonne, 
where  he  had  resided,  to  Montreal,  he  began  business  as  a  general  merchant  in  Notre 
Dame  Street.  He  had  married  Olive  Everett,  and  to  iheni  was  born  in  Montreal  a 
daughter,  Agnes,  in  1798.  In  1814,  his  eldest  daughter,  May,  was  married  to  Henry 
Griffin,  ivho  was  a  Notary  Public  of  that  time.  The  son  of  this  marriage  is  the  well- 
known  J.  C".  Griffin  of  Montreal,  one  of  the  most  highly  respected  and  efticient 
notaries  of  the  jjresent  day.  Mr.  Porteous  was  rather  an  important  man  in  his  day. 
He  held  several  oflices  of  trust.  In  i8i8^he  was  the  President  of  the  Company 
which  organized  the  first  Water  Works  for  supplying  Montreal  with  water.  Previous 
to  this,  during  the  War  of  181 2-14,  he  undertook  at  the  request  of  the  Government 
the  great  task  of  forwarding  supplies  to  the  troops  throughout  the  Province.  In 
1820,  he  was  President  of  the  Agricultural  Society  of  Montreal,  also  Vice-President 
of  the  Savings  Bank  then  in  existence.  He  was  also  for  some  time  a  Director  of  the

Quarter  Sessions  of  Montreal,  lie  wasa  Justice  of  the  Peace  and  rather  a  proiiiinent 
man  in  those  days.  Me  owned  and  farmed  a  i)roperty  above  Sherbrooke  street 
stretching  up  towards  l''letcher's  Field,  with  what  is  called  now  "lamn's"  man- 
sion as  his  summer  residence.  Mr.  Hugh  JJrodie,  sen.,  the  grandfaiher  of  our 
respected  citizen,  Hugh  Hrodie,  Esq..  N.P.,  was  Mr.  Lilly's  farmerfora  time  after  his 
arrival  in  Canada.  One  of  the  daughters  married  Thomas  lloston,  in  i(So6.  He 
died  October,  1822.  The  Hcrahi  thus  speaks  of  him  at  his  death;  "  Died,  T&lt;jhn 
Lilly,  Esq.,  at  the  advanced  age  of  eighty-three  years.  He  was  one  of  the  oldest 
]5ritish  merchants  of  the  city,  having  arrived  in  1763,  and  supjjorted  during  his  long 
residence  of  fifty-nine  years  the  character  of  a  good  subject,  a  virtuous  citizen,  and  an 
exemijlary  Christian."

Pi'.RHAi's  of  all  the  new-comers  and  early  I'higlish  (this,  of  course,  includes  Scotch 
and  Irish  too)  settlers  of  Montreal,  none  are  so  identified  with  its  early  [)rogrt'ss  as 
the  NorthAVesters — those  who  were  connected  with  her  commercial  development 
in  the  then  main  sta[ile  of  her  existence — furs.  Of  all  those  who  embarked  in  this  adven- 
turous undertaking,  none  deserve  a  place  in  this  Gazetteer  more  than  the  subject  of 
this  sketch — Alexander  McKenzie.  IJorn  in  Inverness,  that  beautifid  Capital  of  the 
Scottish  Highlands,  he  had  imbibed  from  the  glorious  scenes  surrounding  the  "  (^ucen 
of  the  Night"  sentiments  of  courage  and  adventure.  He  came  to  Canada  while  still 
an  enthusiastic  lad,  and  entered  the  counting  house  of  John  Ciregory,  where  he  faith- 
fully remained  and  served  for  five  years,  when  his  master  and  the  McLeod  resolved 
to  start  a  company  to  compete  with  a  firm  not  long  before  started,  and  com[)rising 
McTavish,  Frobisher  and  others,  they  induced  Alexander  McKenzie,  who  at  this 
time  was  in  business  for  himself  at  Detroit,  and  also  Peter  Pangman,  another  well- 
known  name  in  Montreal,  to  join  them.      So   heartily  did  these  two  young  men  go

into  the  iindcrtakiiiL;  that  the  now  strong  tlriu  alrcaily  spoken    of  \v;is  gkid  in  17S7 
to  join  ihc  ncw-nuulo  one,  and  the  union  took  pkicc  tiial  year. 

Il  was  tlic  great  desire  and  ambition  of  tlic  iniited  c;«mi)any  to  reach  the  remotest 
Indian  Seitlemenls,  in  order  to  lap,  as  it  were,  the  very  vitals,  the  fountain  head 
of  the  peltry  trade,  aiul  as  said  elsewhere,  which  usually  i'oiind  its  way  to  the  different 
posts  of  tile  liiidsoii  Bay  Company.  Thus  pushing  on  the  ends  and  aims  of  their 
Company,  the  trailers,  each  one,  unconsciously  liecame  great  discoverers. 

In  many  of  tliem  it  is  not  to  i)e  wondered  al  that  after  a  taste  of  this  lomantic 
and  exciting  life  they  should  hecoine  travellers  and  voyageiiis  on  theirown  account, 
and  solelv  for  the  purpose  of  discovering  new  lands  and  new  peopks.  AN'ere  it  nol  iuv 
the  vim.  the  pith,  tiie  energy  and  the  persevirance  of  those  sturdy  Highlanders,  this 
might\'  land  would  have  remained  lor  a  far  longer  period  an  unknown  region,  a  true 
/(77(/  i/uoi^nitir.  The  Author  of  this  volume  well  remembers  when  he  resitled  be- 
tween forty  and  fifty  years  ago  in  the  Isle  of  Lewis,  in  the  Western  Hebrides,  that  a 
ship  annually  took  away  many  of  the  Ixnie  and  muscle  of  the  young  Lewis  High- 
landers to  America  to  serve  in  the  diffeienl  po&gt;ls  of  the  Hudson  J!ay  and  .North 
West  Companies,  and  it  was  from  these  young  men's  \\\)\k  that  the  enormous  fortunes 
of  these  Companies,  ami  tiie  vast  tracts  of  land  at  last  and  finally  granted  to  these 
Companies,  received  their  mainspring  of  action  and  the  source  of  all  their  riches. 

In  June,  17S9,  McKenzie  started  Irom  Fort  Chippewa  to  the  west  end  of  Lake 
Athabasca.  He  called  this  great  body  of  water  "  I,ake  of  the  Hills,"  We  :an  tuid 
the  name  in  that  journey  which  has  rendered  his  name  immortal,  and  which  is  en.- 
bodied  in  the  McKenzie  River,  a  mighty  stream,  one  of  the  greatest  rivers  on  earth, 
which  we,  living  now  at  the  close  of  the  nineteenth  century,  and  a  hundred  ve:;rs  after 
McKenzie's  discovery,  know  almost  as  little  of  as  he  did  when  sailing  on  its  mighty 
w. iters.  Wlial  future  developments  shall  be  brought  forth  in  the  twentieth  century,  we 
know  nf)l,  but  this  they  will  find,  that  the  mighty  McKenzie  River  of  2200  miles  in 
length  will  How  through  a  land  inhabited  by  Kuro!)ean  descendants,  enjoying^  ail 
the  civilization  of  the  great  future,  with  all  iis  progress  and  advancement.  Let  us 
turn  our  eyes  to  the  adventurous  voyager.  With  a  small  band  of  faithhil  followers, 
some  white  men,  some  red  men,  he  ])ursued  his  North- West  vo}age  until  at  last  he 
struck  the  mighty  river  which  will  ever  bear  his  name.  Following  its  wanderings  he 
found  out  the  enormous  lakes,  (ireat  Slave  Lake,  Great  J«ear  Lake  and  Athabasca 
Lake — lakes  they  may  be  called,  but  really  inland  seas — and  at  last  arrived  after 
innumerable  incidents  and  adventures  at  the  mouth  of  the  river,  which  he  found 
emptying  itself  into  the  Arctic  Ocean.  A  river  the  McKenzie  is,  longer  than  our  own 
mighty  .St,  Lawrence,  counting  in  all  its  lakes  and  intervening  rivers;  a  river,  one  of 
the  grandest,  longest  and  most  magnificent  in  scenery  in  all  the  world, 

(October,  1782,  saw  him  again  on  a  voyage  of  discovery.  He  was  determined 
to  follow  the  Peace  River  and  exi)lore  it  all.  He  traced  it  actually  running  across 
the  Rocky  Mountains^  a  thing  ever  before  thought  impossible.  He  traced  it  to 
the  Mountains,  and  being    assured  by    the  Indians  that    its  waters  llowed  into  a

set  in,  resulting  in  the  rupture  of  a  blood  vessel.  The  death  was  sudden  and  totally 
unlooked  for.  Mr.  Brayley  was  a  native  of  Devonshire,  England,  and  came  to  this 
country,  first  settling  in  New  Brunswick,  when  quite  a  young  man.  In  1877,  he  came 
to  Montreal,  and  soon  by  i)robity  and  attention  to  his  work  built  up  a  large  busi-

Apostle,  where  for  seven  years  he  was  people's  Warden.  He  was  a  conscientious, 
business  man,  upright  and  respected.

century,  and  before  the  eslablishment  of  the  North  West  C'ompany  in  1806.  He 
soon  made  a  large  fortune,  retiring  from  business,  and  built  a  fine  house  on  the  other 
side  (^f  the  Mountain  and  called  it  "  JJeaver  Lodge."  Here  he  died  and  his  son

BENJAMIN   A.  TESTARI)   DkMONTIGNV. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  at  St.  Jerome,  County  of  Terrebonne,  in  183S. 
It  was  then  the  middle  of  the  RebeHion  of    1837-38,  when  the  whole  country  north 
of  tlie  St.  Lawrence   was   in  a  stale   of  commotion.     His   father  was  Lieut.-Colonel 
Testard  Chevalier  DeMontigny,  a  name  not  unknown   in  Canadian  History.     The 
son  was  sent  for  a  course  of  studies  to  the  College  of  Joliette,  where  lie  distinguished 
himself  by  assiduity  to  his  studies  and  advancement  in  all  the  branches  of  his  cur- 
riculum.    After  passing  his  legal  studies  he  wiis  admitted  to  the  Bar  in  1859,  when 
he  was  exactly  twenty-one  years  of  age,  having  just  then  obtained  his  majority.     One 
year  after  this,  in  1S60,  the  movement  began  to  raise  a  battalion  of  Pontifical  Zouaves 
to  aid  His  Holiness  the  I'ono  in    the  struggles  then  going  on  i!i    Italy  against  Oiri- 
baldism  and  those  who  had  raised  tiic  standard  of  battle  against  the  powers  that  be. 
On  15th  January,  i86f,  Mr.   DeMontigny  joined  that   battalion,  in  which  he  served 
two  years.     I    presimie   these   were  llie  two   most   eventful  years  of  his   life.     The 
battalion  of  Zouaves  imder  Colonel  Allet  and  Lieut. -Colonel  DeCharette  numbered 
1,500  men.     As  our  subject  is,  no  doubt,  the  oldest  Zouave  in   the  country  now,  in 
connection  with  this  sketch  we  must  be  pardoned  in  giving  a  short  account  of  the 
movements  of  the  Zouaves.     The  Italian  Civil  War  continued  for  some  years,  and  in 
lhiy,'irs  rSr)S,    1869  and  187c,  tlie  chief  number  of  Zouaves  were  sent  from  Can;ida. 
In    1S67,  Murray  and    Laroque  were  severely  wouiule'd  at   the   battle  of   Menlana- 
When  this  news  arrived    in   Canada,  and   that   the  Zouaves  had   made  a  successful 
march  and  covered  themselves   with  glory  at  this  battle,  the  spirit  of  adventure,  as 
well  as  love  to  the  Holy  Father,  filled  the  bosoms  of  thousands  of  young  Canadians. 
The  men  who  then  went  forth  were  men  (jf  good  family.     Oustave  Drolet  left  on  the 
7th  Xovember,  18G7,  for  Rome.  MM.  Desilet,  Prendergast,  Henault  and  Tetu,  at  the 
end  of  December.    Scores  of  Canadian  youths  voluntee-red  th.eir  services.   The  Bishop 
of  Montreal  took  the  direction  of  the  movement  into  his  own  hands,  and  eneouraged 
this  new  Crusade  of  the  19th  Century. 

On  the  26th  December,  1867,  a  committee  was  formed  in  Montreal  under  the 
presidency  of  .\L  O.  B.Mthelet  composed  of  ten  citizens,  of  whom  MM.  Rivard  and 
Koyal  were  the  joint  secretaries.  At  the  cry  of  ''  Dieu  le  veut,"  scattered  broadcast 
through  the  parishes  by  the  cures,  hundreds,  nay  thousands,  of  young  men  willingly 
offered  themselves.  The  committee  soon  organized  tlie  first  detachment  of  137 
"  Zouaves  Canadiens."  They  left  Montreal  i8th  February,  1868,  under  the  direction 
of  Messire  Moreau  as  "aumonier,"  and  J.  Taillefer  as  commander.  The  [jassage  of 
this  little  army  of  crusaders — among  those  wlio  left  were  our  i)resent  energetic 
Governor  of  the  Oaol,  L.  A.  A'allee  ;  Geo.  A.  Hughes,  the  present  Chief  of  Police, 
and  Lucien  Forget,  Clerk  of  the  Recorder's  Court — caused  an  immense  excitement 
both  in  the  United  States  and  France.  "  Drapeau  blanc  en  tete,  avec  la  devise  : 
Aime  Dieu  et  va  ton  chcmin,"  these  Zouaves  were  acclaimed  the  champions  of 
the  most  holy  and  noblest  of  all  causes  of  the  present  century.     In  their  passage

through  Lyons,  France,  De  la  Perade,  a  member  of  the  French  Academy,  wrote  a 
beautiful  ode  on  their  career.     We  give  four  lines  : — 

"  AUez  voire  cheniin,  Frangais  de  Nouveau  Monde, 
Race  de  nos  aleux  tout  i  coup  ranini^e, 
AUez,  laissant  cliez  nous  une  trace  feconde, 
OflVir  un  noble  sang  au  Dieu  que  vous  aimez." 

The  Montreal  Committee  sent  six  other  detachments  to   Rome    after  that   of 
February,  1868,  viz. : 

ist,  on  May  14,  1868,  22  men. 
2nd,  on  May  23,  1868,  28  men. 
3rd,  on  June  25,  t868,  48  men. 
4lh,  on  September  30,  1869,  95  men. 
5th,  on  August  iS,  1870,  38  men. 
6th,  on  September  ist,  1870,  115  men. 

When  we  count  those  who  went  singly  or  in  small  squads,  we  have  over  530 

Voluntcer-Zouavcs  who  went  to  Rome  from  Canada.     After  the  fall  of  the   Eternal 

City,  on  the   20th  September,  1870,  into  the  hands  of  Victor  Emanuel,  the  Italian 

King,  the  war  was  at  an  end,  and  the    Zouaves  marching  out  of  Rome  with  all  the 

honors  of  war,  and  by  the  Gate  Angelica,  were  immediately  transported  to  Leghorn 

and  thence   to   Liverpool  en  route  for  Canada.     Tiicy  landed   in   New  York,   5th 

November,  after  having  been  seventeen  days  at   sea,  and  without  delay  they  safely 

arrived  in  Montreal,  where  an  immense  concourse  of  people  welcomed  them  back — 

their  sons,  their  brothers  and  all  their  friends.     The  Zouaves  founded  an  association 

among  themselves  to  perpetuate  tlieir  journey   to   Rome.     Last  year,  1891,  a  great 

gathering  took  place  at  the  home  of  the  Premier  of  Quebec — near  Three  Rivers. 

Hon.  Honore  Mercier  had  received  medals  for  each  Zouave,  when  last  in  Rome,  and 

the  occasion  was  made  use  of  for  a  reunion  of  old  comrades,  and  of  talking  over  once 

more  their  hairbreadth  escapes  in  sunny  Italy.     The  subject  of  our  sketch  being  the 

oldest  Zouave,  had  the  honor  of  distributing   the  medals  and  pinning  them  on  the 

breasts  of  the  various  heroes. 

Mr.  DeMontigny  resumed  the  duties  of  his  profession  when  he  returned  to 
Montreal,  and,  in  1872,  he  was  made  District  Magistrate  for  Terrebonne.  In  1880,  he 
was  appointed  Recorder  of  Montreal,  to  succeed  the  late  Mr.  Sexton,  who  had  held 
the  position  for  many  years.  He  is  the  author  of  several  valuable  literary  works.

The  Recorder  has  done  much  hy  his  intluence  and  recommeadations  in  alleviat- 
ing the  condition  of  the  poor  and  the  criminal  classes,  and,  so  far  as  has  been 
observed,  tries  always  l(j  temper  his  judgments  with  mercy.  He  is  particularly 
anxiou^  regarding  youthfid  criminals  and  tiie  better  classification  of  all  convicts  in 
our  Prisons  and  Penilentiaries.  This  laudable  object  may  in  the  near  future  be 
accomplished,  and,  if  so,  one  great  m  jtive  will  have  been  the  exertion  towards  its  con- 
summation by  the  pn  sent  Recorder  of  Montreal. 

HON.   THOMAS  D'ARCV   McGEE. 

The  following  tribute  to  an  Irishman,  ''great  and  well  beloved,"  is  from  the  pen  of 
the  well-known  writer,  Mrs.  Sadlier,  one  of  our  best  writers  and  not  enough  known  by 
Canndians.  This  eminent  Canadian  statesman,  ])()et  and  orator,  was  born  at  Carling- 
ford.  County  Louth,  Ireland,  on  the  13th  of  April,  1S25.  His  father,  Mr.  James 
McGce,  was  an  officer  in  the  Coast  Guard  Service,  and  his  mother,  Dorcas  Catherine 
Morgan,  was  the  accomplished  daughter  of  a  Dublin  bookseller,  who  had  been  im- 
prisoned and  financially  ruined  oy  his  participation  in  the  conspiracy  of  179S,  as  a 
United  Irishman.  Of  this  union,  Thomas  D'Arcy  McCee  was  the  fifth  child  and 
second  son.  ]!orn  and  nurtuied  amid  livj  grand  and  lovely  scenery  of  the  Ross- 
tree(;r  coast,  his  early  childhood  Heeled  by  in  a  region  of  wild,  romantic  beauty, 
which  impressed  itself  for  ever  on  his  heart  and  mind,  and  tended  not  a  little,  as  we 
may  u'ell  suppose,  to  foster,  if  not  create,  that  jjoetic  fancy  which  made  the  charm 
of  his  life,  niid  infused  itself  into  all  he  wrote  and  all  he  said.  Like  most  eminent 
men,  he  owed  much  of  his  genius  to  a  highly  intellectual  and  gifted  mother.  He  was 
eight  years  old  when  the  family  removed  to  Wexfortl,  in  which  ancient  and  historic 
city  the  years  of  his  youth  and  early  manhood  ])assed.  -Soon  after  their  arrival  in 
Wexford,  the  McGee  family  sustained  a  heavy  loss  in  the  death  of  the  excellent  and 
admirable  wife  and  mother,  which  left  a  deej)  and  lasting  wound  in  the  heart  of  her 
favorite  son,  Thom;is,  who,  to  the  last  day  of  his  life,  fondly  cherished  her  memory. 
Mr.  McGee's  youth  was  s|)ent  in  the  ardent  pursuit  of  knowledge,  history  and 
poetry  being  his  favorite  studies,  and  in  these  he  became,  so  to  say,  a  master.  I'llo- 
quence  was  a  special  gift  bestowed  upon  him  from  his  earliest  years.  He  was  little 
more  than  seventeen,  when,  after  paying  a  visit  to  his  aunt  in  Providence,  R.L,  he 
arrived  in  Boston,  iust  when  the  "Repeal  Movement"  was  at  it;&gt;  height  amongst  the 
L-ish  population  of  that  city.  It  was  the  4tii  July,  and  I'liomas  D'Arcy  McGee,  boy 
though  he  was,  addressed  the  j)eo[)le  that  day,  and  his  precocious  eloquence  sur- 
prised and  delighted  the  multitudes  who  heard  him.  He  was  soon  after  offered,  and 
accepted,  a  position  on  the  staff  of  the  Hosto/i  Pilot,  and  two  years  later  became 
editor  of  that  journal.  He  very  soon  made  such  a  reputation  for  himself  as  a  jour- 
nalist that  his  fame  crossed  the  ocean,  and  he  was  invited  by  the  proprietor  of  the 
Dublin  Ft  ccman's  Jounial,  then,  as  now,  one  of  the  leading  Irish  papers,  to  become 
its  editor.     This  offer,   which  he   at   once  accepted,    he  justly   considered  a  signal

tiiunipli.  So  at  twenty  years  of  aj^c,  our  i)()cl-jouriialist  took  his  jilace  in  llie  front 
rank  of  the  Irish  press.  His  conneclion  with  the  Frccmaii's  Journal.,  however,  was 
not  of  long  (Juration,  and  we  next  fnul  him,  witli  his  friend  Charles  Gavin  Duffy,  and 
two  other  talented  young  Irishmen,  editing  'he  newly  started  Dublin  Nation,  which 
soon  became  a  power  in  the  couniry.  and  the  mouthpiece  of  the  National  pai  ly, 
afterwai'ds  known  as  the  voung  Irelanders.  it  was  owing  to  his  conneclion  with  this 
brilliant  and  powerful  organ,  and  his  leal  or  supposed  participation  in  tlie  abortive 
rebellion  of  184S,  that  Mr.  .Nhdee  became  obnoxious  to  the  J5riiish  (lovernmenl, 
and  was  forced  to  tlce  to  America  in  that  memorable  \^\.\\.  leaving  his  young  wife  to 
follow  him  when  once  he  had  prepaied  a  home  for  her. 

He  started  in  1S4S.  or  the  year  following,  the  Xm'  York  Xjtion.  whic:h  paper 
from  various  untoward  circumsta.nces  did  not  succeed,  and  Mr.  McClee.  being  in- 
duced to  remove  to  llostot^  commenced  in  that  city  llie  ]iublication  of  the 
Auicrican  Celt,  win'ch  he  subse&lt;]uently  removed  to  New  York,  and  for  some  yiars 
published   it   there  with   marked    success. 

It  was  during  the  jjublication  of  the  Celt  in  llostoii  that  the  maiuiiiig  niind 
of  its  editor  l.-egan  giadualiy  to  recogni/e  the  senseless  folly  of  the  revoluiionaiy 
doctrines  to  the  dissemination  ami  support  of  which  he  had  hitherto  bent  all 
the  energies  of  his  powerful  mind.  The  c;int  of  taction,  the  hery  denunciations 
which,  after  all.  amounted  to  nothing,  and  had  onlv  ili;'  effect  (jf  unsettling  men's 
minds  and  leading  many  to  luin  and  destruction,  giving  rise  to  a  general  spirit 
of  insubf)rdinalioii,  he  began  to  see  in  their  true  ccjlor.--.  It  then  became  his 
aim  to  elevate  the  Irish  [jcople,  not  bv  impracticable  schemes  of  rebillioii,  but 
by  teaching  tiiem  to  make  the  best  of  tiieir  actual  condition,  to  cultivate  ;imong 
them  the  arts  of  peace,  and  r.ii.^e  tiiemselves  by  steadv  industry  ami  incieasing 
enlighteinnenl  to  liie  level  of  more  ])i-osperous  nations,  'i'hough  as  fondly  as  ever 
devoted  to  the  hind  ot  Ids  birth,  he  became  more  conservative  in  his  views. -atid 
that  because  he  had  made  a  deeper  and  more  earnest  study  of  the  eternal  principles 
whicii  lie  at  the  foundation  of  ail  human  affairs,  and  of  the  relation  between  the 
governing  and  the  governed.  This  change,  this  new  direction  given  to  his  thoughts, 
was  sincerely  owing  to  tlie  i'urtlier  development  of  .Mr.  McCiee's  own  reasoning 
powers  and  the  salulaiy  iiilluence  of  wisi'  and  learned  Christian  friends.  ^'et  it 
was  unfortunately  misrepresented,  and  excited  much  and  bitter  hostility  among  th.at 
rcvoluiionar_\-  party  (jf  which  he  had  so  long  been  a  brilliant  and  able  supporter. 

During  the  years  that  Mr.  McCee  was  editing  the  /American  Ccl*  in  Boston  and 
New  York,  and  subsequently  the  Buffalo  Sentinel  in  that  border  city,  he  deliv- 
ered in  nearly  all  the  principal  towns  and  cities  of  the  United  Slates  and  tlie 
British  Provinces  a  prodigious  number  of  lectures  (m  all  manner  of  subjects  calcu- 
lated to  improve  and  elevate  the  people.  He  also  organized  and  look  a  leading 
part  in  the  convention  of  one  hundred  delegates  who  met  in  Buffalo,  for  the  special 
purpose  of  promoting  and  increasing  Irish  emigration. 

A  short  time  after  this,  Mr.  McCiee  was  invited  by  a  number  of  influential  Irish 


C.AZKITEKK    OK    MONTRKAI,.  373 

citizens  of  Monlreal  to  make  liis  home  in  that  city,  Injldiny  out  to  him  tlic  promise 
of  a  Ijiilliant  success,  which  promise  the  future  more  than  justified.  Soon  after  his 
arrival  in  Montreal,  he  commenced  the  j)ul)lication  ofiheiVt7t.'  Era,  which  journal, 
owing  to  his  as  yet  imperfect  knowledge  of  Canadian  affairs,  was  not  a  success,  and 
was  discontinued  when  Mr.  Mcdee  was  elected  by  the  Irish  citizens  of  Montreal  as 
one  of  tlie  three  members  for  liiat  city.  .Such  enliie  satisfaction  did  his  conduct  in 
the  House  of  .Assembly  give  to  his  friends  and  constituents  that  .1  number  of  gentle- 
men sul)scri'&gt;ed  a  considerable  sum  of  money  and  purchased  a  handsome  residence 
in  Montmorency  Terrace,  S:.  Catherine  street,  which  lliey  presented,  furnisheel,  to 
Mr.  Mctieeas  a  homestead  for  his  family.  ( )f  the  I'arliamcntary  (-areer  of  Mr. 
McGee  in  Canada,  space  will  not  permit  us  to  speak  at  length.  Suffice  it  to  say 
that  it  was  successful  beyond  all  anli(:i[)ation,  and  won  for  him  a  1  isiing  and  honor- 
able place  amongst  the  statesmen  of  the  country.  11  is  rare  and  ciptivaling  eloquence, 
his  consummate  tact,  his  profouiul  abiiit}-,  made  iiini.  after  a  little  tinv,-,  ilie  mo^t 
brilliant,  as  well  as  the  most  popular  membjr  of  the  Legislature.  trium[)hing  even 
over  political  hostility,  and  making  friends  of  religious  and  political  opponents,  'i'o 
his  expansive  mind  ami  soaring  genius  wa-;  mai'ily  due  the  I'nion  of  the  I'l-ovinces 
as  the  Xew  Dominion  of  Canada.  During  t!ie  Government  of  Lord  .Monck,  Mr. 
Mcdee  was  api)ointed  ['resident  of  the  Lxecuiive  Council,  and  acted,  moreo\er.  for 
a  short  lime,  as  Provincial  Secretary, /v 6*  tciii.  It  was  during  tiie  time  of  his  holding 
this  double  olfice  that  he  wrote  the  concluding  portion  of  his  popular  Ilisioryof 
Ireland,  confessetUy  one  of  the  best  and  most  readable  histories  of  that  country  that 
has  yet  appearetl.  The  other  books  written  1)\-  Mr.  McCee  at  v.irious  periods 
of  his  life  were  "The  (lallei'y  of  Irish  Wiiters  of  the  Seventeenth  Century."  "  .Mc- 
Murroch."  •'O'Connell  antl  his  Friends,"  and  •'Irish  Settlers  in  .Vmerica."  His 
"Canadian  Hallads ''  were  embodied  in  the  general  collection  of  his  poems  pub- 
lished in  Xew  York  since  his  laniented  death. 

Mr.  McCee  ha  1  been  three  times  returned  f  u'  Monlreal  V/cst,  twice  by  accla- 
mation ;  aiul  was  again  elected  by  the  same  constituency  as  a  member  of  the  House 
of  Commons  of  ihe  Dominion,  in  live  first  session  of  which,  as  in  the  former  House 
of  Assembly,  he  won  golden  o[)inions  from  all,  and  had  apparently  a  long  and  useful 
career  before  him,  wiien.  on  leaving  the  l*arliament  liuildings,  in()itawa,  on  the 
morning  of  .Vpril  7th,  1869,  he  was  followed  by  an  assassin  ,vho  had  been  lying  in 
wait  for  liim,  and  shot  dead  at  the  door  of  his  lodgings.  .Sad  and  pitiable  close  for 
such  a  lil'e.  It  is  not  for  us  to  say  who  were  the  instigators  of  so  foul  a  crime,  but  a 
man  named  Whelan  was  arrested,  tried  for  the  murder  in  Ottawa,  and  paid  with  his 
worthless  life  the  atrocious  crime  of  which  he  was  convicted,  a  crime  which  robbed 
the  Dominion  of  its  foremost  statesman,  and  the  Irish  race  of  one  of  its  most  gifted 
sons.  The  whole  country  was  horrified  by  the  ,news  of  .Mr.  ^[cGee's  most  crue 
death,  and  the  iniblic  manifestations  of  sorrow  were  great  and  also  universal.  A 
public  and  most  magnificent  funeral  was  given  to  her  murdered  representative  by 
the  City  of  Montreal.     All  classes  of  the  citizens  vied  with  each  other  in  shewing

their  respect  and  admiration  for  tlie  cniincnt  man,  wlio.  coming  amongst  them  as  a 
stranger  only  a  few  years  before,  iiad  in  that  comparatively  short  time  gained  the 
hearts  of  the  people  and  entitled  himself  to  the  nation's  gratitude.  'J'he  name  of 
Thomas  D'Arcy  McGee  will  go  down  to  posterity  as  one  of  the  men  of  whom  the 
Dominion  of  Canada  has  reason  to  he  proud. 

As  a  specimen  of  the  ])oetical  genius  of  my  J'ri :/u/,  for  he  was  a  good  friend 
and  a  much  loved  one  by  me,  I  insert  the  following  well-known  j  oeni  on  the  Dis-

In  the  crowded  old  cathedral  all  tlic  to\\n  were  on  their  knees 

Vox  the  safe  return  of  kinsmen  from  the  luidi^cover'd  seas  ; 

And  every  autunm  lilast  ihat  swejit  o'er  ]iinnacle  and  pier

A  year  pass'd  o'er  St.  Malo— ai^ain  came  roiiiil  the  day

In  the  forests  of  the  north — while  liis  townsmen  niouni'd  his  los.-^

lie  told  them  of  a  region,  hard,  iron-bound,  and  cold, 
Nor  seas  of  pearl  abounded,  nor  mines  of  shining  gold  ; 
Wliere  the  wind  from  Thule  freezes  the  word  upon  the  lip, 
And  the  ice  in  spring  comes  sailing  athwart  the  early  shi]i ; 
He  told  them  of  the  frozen  scene  until  they  thrill'd  with  fear, 
And  piled  fresh  fuel  on  the  hearth  to  make  him  better  cheer.

But  wlien  he  changed  the  strain — he  told  how  soon  are  cast 

In  early  spring  the  fetters  thai  hold  the  waters  fast ; 

How  the  winter  causeway  broken  is  drifted  out  to  sea, 

And  the  rills  and  rivers  sing  with  pride  the  anthem  of  the  free  ; 

How  the  magic  wand  of  summer  clad  the  landscape  to  his  eyes, 

Like  the  dry  bones  of  '.he  just  when  they  wake  in  Paradise.

DR.  K.  P.  HOWARD 

WAslforn  in  Aronlrc  il,  Jaiuiaiy  i2lh,  1S23.  His  paiciUs,  Robert  Howard  ;iiid  Miirgart-t 
Kent,  cimc  from  Ircla:ul  to  Mon'.real,  where  his  father  went  into  business.  The  Doctor 
studied  Medicine  botii  here  and  in  luiiope,  graduated  from  McGill  College  in  ICS4S, 
and  was  made  a  L.C'.S.M.  in  1S40,  in  which  same  year  lie  began  practising  in  his 
native  city.  For  over  thirty  years  Dr.  Howard  was  one  of  our  most  intluential  and 
leading  Physicians  and  Surgeon-^.  His  whole  soul  wns  set  on  the  important  duties 
of  his  profession.  To  him  is  given  the  honor  of  introducing  into  Montreal  the  prac- 
tice now  universal  of  bedside  instruction,  a  most  important  part,  when  we  look  at 
it,  of  medical  education. 

He  was  President  of  the  Canada  Medical  Association,  also  President  of  the 
College  of  Physicians  and  Surgeons  of  (Quebec,  and  was  a  Governor  f(jr  more  than  a 
(juarter  of  a  ccntiMv.  He  was  also  I'residenl  of  the  Medico-Chirurgical  Society  of 
Montreal,  and  1  nia\'  add  here  no  medical  man  in  his  native  city  had  a  higher 
standing. 

He  was  also  a  diligent  student  and  a  writer  to  various  i)eriodical  publi- 
cati(jns.  Some  of  his  writings  are  most  im[)ortant  to  the  medical  fraternity.  'I'hose 
relating  to  tonsumption  (though  rather  o])posed  to  general  ideas)  have  been  at  last 
gradually  ;ulop;etl  by  the  l&lt;"aculty  at  large,  proving  him  to  have  been  :  far  seeing  and 
a  far-thinlcing  man,  ahead  of  the  times,  and  realizing  what  the  future  will  bring  forth 
in  all  its  advancement  and  jjiogress  in  every  [ihase  and  department  of  literature, 
philosophy  and  science. 

He  was  Professor  of  Medicine  in  McCill  College,  aiul  President  of  the  Canada 
Medical  Association.  In  connection  with  these  societies  his  papers  read  before  them 
or  sent  to  Medical  journals  on  affections  of  the  lungs,  of  the  heart,  and  diseases  of  the 
chest  have  not  oidy  been  numerous,  but  showed  that  the  Doctor  had  a  great  and  favor- 
ite study  in  these  diseases,  and  did  much  by  these  writings  t(;  advance  the  knowledge 
requisite  to  their  relief. 

Jn  1876,  he  contributed  a  most  inii)ortant  paper  to  the  International  ^ledical 
Congress  of  Philadelphia,  on  '' Pernicious  An;cmia,"  which  was  the  most  elaborate

Dr.  Howard  was  first  married  in  1855  to  Miss  Frances  Chipman,  daughter 
of  the  late  Judge  Chipman  of  Flalifax,  and  had  one  son,  the  present  Dr.  Howard, 
who  married  the  only  daughter  of  our  well-known  benevolent  citizen  and  member 
of  Parliament,  Sir  Donald  Smith.  Mrs.  Howard  died  in  1870.  In  1872,  he  married 
Miss  Eva  Lewis,  of  London,  England,  and  had  three  children.  The  Doctor  died 
two  years  ago,  and  at  his  death  men  said:  "A  good  man,  noble  philanthrojiist  and 
honored  native  of  Montreal  lias  passed  away.  It  will  be  a  long  time  before  one  will 
be  found  to  fill  his  place."

accept  the  vice-presidency  of  the  St.  I'aul,  .M  inu'sipolis  and  .Manitojja.  Kailuay.  a 
step  which  in  due  time  was  to  have  important  results.  It  will  be  remembered  that, 
as  in  the  east,  the  entrance  of  the  Maritime  |)i-ovinces  into  the  (amadian  (Jonfedera- 
tiou  necessitated  the  construction  of  the  Intercolonial  Railway.  So  in  the  extreme

communication  should  be  established  between  ihe  Pacific  region  and  the  rest  of  the

an  age  fertile  in  great  undertakings.  In  i.Syr,  the  survey  was  begun,  but  the  scheme

last  a  syndicate  was  formed,  with  Mr.  (now  Lord  .\bjunt-Slephen)  as  its  leadiii}; 
spirit.  .Nfr.  .Angus  was  (jne  of  the  original  body,  and  has  remained  in  cc^nnection 
with  the  incorporate  company  ever  since  as  one  of  its  directors.  He  shares,  there-

su'.iciently  appreciate  the  services  of  the  men  by  whom  the  (Janadian  Pacil'ic  Rail- 
way was  completed,  an  all  thr&lt;Migh  route  from  ocean  to  ocean  on  British  territory 
and  a  hand  of  union  between  the  metropolis  and  the  firllu-sl  east,  without  which

Montreal  l(j  he  educated,  and  afterwards  he  entered  the  employ  of  the  Inir  Compjiiy. 
In  1792,  to  sliow  how  he  worked  for  his  employers,  Sir  Alcxantler  Mackenzie  tells  us 
that  Cuthbert  (Irani  had  penetrated  as  far  as  the  Slave  Ki\er  in  17S6.  In  one  of 
these  expeditions  no  less  than  six  of  his  voy  a  incurs  had  been  drowned  whilst  he

inlliience  over  all  tiie  Indians  and  I  Lilf-lJreeds.  We  Inid  his  name  at  the  head  of  the

not find  out,  whether  he  died  in  tlie  Xorth-West,  or  retired,  as  so  many  of  the  traders 
did  to  Montreal,  and  enjoyed  their  fi^rtunes,  and  spent  the  latter  part  of  their  lives  in

MARIli  MARdUERITK  DU   FROST, 
l,i,s  SdoiKs  (Jkisi'.s. 

This  lieioic  woman  was  born  al  Wircnnes,  near  .Monlrcul,  in  lyoi.  Siic  was  the 
daughter  of  a  brave  officer  of  Marine  from  Brittany,  wiu)  h,.d  come  to  remain  in 
(^lanada.  A  former  society  luid  looked  after  the  poor  till  the  advent  of  the  subject  of 
oiu"  sketch  into  the  Institution,  but  it  had  become  almost  inert  on  account  ofjxjverty 
fifty  years  after  its  foinidation  in  1747. 

In  1722,  she  married  M.  d'Vouville.  He  died  in  1730,  leavnig  two  children. 
She  determined  henceforth  to  consecrate  herself  to  works  of  charity.  She  began  bv 
visitnig  the  sick  at  their  houses  and  by  receiving  some  in  her  own  home.  \ery  soon 
several  good  girls  joined  themselves  to  her.  She  extended  her  circle  n(  charity  and 
influence,  and  her  intelligent  zeal  in  all  her  actions  so  moved  the  St.  Sul[)iciaus,  that 
they  unanimously  gave  her  the  direction  of  the  (leneral  Hospital.  She  entered  on 
charge  in  1747,  but  almost  immediately  there  arose  against  her  a  cabal  amor.gst  some 
of  the  most  honorable  citizens.  This  was  on  account  of  the  ''  Freres  Hospitallers," 
whose  functions  they  considered  were  being  infringed  on — an  ancient  society  who  had 
done  much  good  in  its  day.  Even  the  Governor  and  the  authorities  leagued  to 
expel  Madame  d'Vouville  from  the  ''  I'Hopital  Gene.al,"  and  they  wrote  to  Paris  all 
that  they  could  imagine  derogatory  of  her.  Hut  all  in  vain,  the  C'ourt  at  N'ersailles 
maintained  her  position,  and  by  letters  jjatent  in  1753  made  Madame  d'Vouville  the 
head  or  Superioress  of  the  establishment  of  the  General  Hospital.  'I'hen  she  adopted 
every  way  of  clearing  the  Institution  of  debt,  which  she  happily  accomplished. 

In  1765,  a  serious  fire  crippled  her  in  the  housing  of  iiS  persons  then  under  her 
care.  Five  years  after,  this  indefatigable  woman  had  once  more  erected  the  building, 
and  now  had  170  persons  dependent  on  her. 

After  the  Cession  she  received  60,000  livres  annually  by  work  done  for  the 
troops  and  government,  by  annual  donations,  subscriptions  and  gifts.  It  was  then 
she  considered  the  idea  and  carried  it  out,  of  adopting  found  infants — infants 
deserted  by  their  mothers — and  those  confided  to  their  care ;  and  also  a  Refuge  for 
Penitents.  Her  faith  that  God  would  provide  was  constant.  At  one  time  when  entirely 
destitute  of  means,  she  found  several  pieces  of  gold.  Another  time  when  there  was 
no  bread  in  the  house,  a  large  quantity  of  tlour  came  to  the  door  without  anyone 
knowing  who  had  sent  it  or  whence  it  came.  But  this  continues  to  this  very  day. 
With  an  income,  say,  of  $30,000  per  annum,  it  distributes  $60,000  per  annum  in 
charity. 

Madame  d'Vouville  can  never  be  forgotten.  She  was  a  Canadian,  pure  and 
simple,  an  honor  to  Canadians,  and  her  good  works,  though  she  is  dead,  yet 
speak. 

We  must  now  speak  a  little  of  another  one  connected  with  this  Institution. 
Catherine  KoUmyer,  born  of  Protestant  parentage,  was  early  convinced  that  her 
vocation  was  with  the  Grey  Nuns,  and  so  she  requested  admittance   into  the  com-

We  may  add  that  the  old  l)iiiUhii[;s  of  llie  '•  .Seems  (irises  "  have  years  ago  been

which  to  me  call  up  reminiscences  of  Montreal  of  years  ago.  'I'he  first  is  sister  to  him

and  oratory,  independent  of  his  legal  lore.  I  have  much  pleasure,  through  the 
kindness  of  my  late  old  friend,  K.  |.  Devins,  in  ])lacing  this  imperfect  sketch  of

"The  antecedents  of  Mr.  Hodges  constitute  him  another  striking  illustration  of 
self-help.  Tf)  his  own  indomitable  perseverance  alone,  coupled  with  the  strictest 
integrity  of  character  and  honorable  conduct,  does  he  owe  his  ])resent  high  position 
in  the  engineering  world — a  position  which  did  not  fail  to  attract  the  notice  of  his 
future  king,  oii  the  occasion  of  the  laying  of  the  laijt  stone  of  the  Victoiia  IJriilge  by 
His  Royal  Highness  the  Prince  of  Wales,  on  the  25th  of  August,  1860.  Of  the  many 
claimants  that  have  sprung  up,  both  in  IWitain  and  in  Canada,  for  the  honor  of  being 
the  originator  or  designer  of  the  Victoria  Jiridgc,  it  is  not  our  intention  to  speak  ; 
but  we  are  at  the  present  time  about  to  ititroduce  a  name  in  connection  with  tliis 
stupendous  structure  which  well  deserves  the  record  we  here  give  it.  I'rom  the 
hour  in  which  the  lu'st  cofferdam  was  laid,  until  the  last  rivet  was  driven,  which  com- 
pleted the  Victoria  Bridge  as  it  now  stands,  the  presiding  genius  was  .Mr.  Hodges,  as 
the  engineer  of  tlie  contractors,  Messrs.  I'eto,  ISrassy  and  IJetts. 

"  .\rr.  Hodges  was  born  on  6th  .April,  1814,  in  Queeid)orough,  in  the  county  of 
Kent,  where  he  was  i:ducatcd  at  the  Crammar  School  of  that  town.  After  going 
through  the  schclastic  duties  of  a  (Irammar  School  of  that  day,  he  was  removed,  in 
order  to  receive  a  Government  appointment  whicii  some  of  his  Parliamentary  friends 
had  promised,  but  which  ])romise  was  never  redeemed.  After  waiting  until  his 
patience  was  exhausted,  he  apprenticed  himself,  at  the  age  of  seventeen,  to  a  builder, 
residing  at  ]irompton  near  Chatham.  Having  served  four  years  in  this  trade,  he  com- 
menced his  railway  practice  under  Mr.  John  Rowland,  the  agent  of  Macintosh,  the 
contractor  of  the  Creenwich  Railway,  his  first  essay  in  railway  work  being  the  cent- 
ring of  the  arches.  After  this  he  went  to  Shard,  and  at  the  age  of  twenty-two  had 
charge  of  the  building  of  the  Union  Houses  of  that  place.  These  finished,  his  next 
work  was  at  the  Shakspcare  Tunnel,  Dover,  which  he  superintended  at  first  as  the 
agent  of  the  contractor,  Mr.  Rowland;  but,  on  his  death,  Mr.  Hodges  assumed  the 


(iAZKITHKR  Dl'  MONTH  KAL.  387 

charge  of  the  work  in  concL-rt  with  the  resi&lt;leiit  engineer  of  the  South  Ivisteni  Rail- 
way :  and  it  is  not  a  little  remarkalile,  that  every  ounce  of  gunpowder  used  in  the 
large  blasts  was  de])osited  in  its  plaee  by  iiis  own  hands.  During  the  progress  of 
this  work  \\v  attra(  ted  the  attention  of  the  laic  Sir  W'm.  Cul)itt,  then  i-nginrer-in-chief 
of  tlu'  South  Ivistcrn  Railway,  to  whom  Mr.  Hodges  has  frecpiently  stated  he  is  more 
indebted  for  his  subscMpicnl  rise  and  progress  in  his  profession  than  to  any  other 
man,     'The  puj)!!  in  this  case  is  .1  worthy  disciple  of  a  \ery  worthy  masliT. 

'•  It  was  at  this  time  that  a  i niiou.-.  resolve  was  made  by  young  1  lodges,  and  it 
was  ihis,  that,  if  spared,  he  ^vould  work  until  the  age  of  thirty-five,  for  whatever 
amount  of  remuneration  others  might  think  his  labor  worth,  but  afii'r  that  time  //&lt;• 
should  name  the  price  at  which  his  services  were  to  be  ()l)tained.  And  to  this  end 
he  steadily  kept  on  prtjgressing,  so  that  by  the  time  this  period  of  his  life  was  reachetl 
— having  superintended  thedriving  of  the  Abbott's  Cliff,  Seahani,  and  Archcliff  I'ort 
tunnels,  aiul  the  erection  of  the  Sliakspeare  viaduct,  along  with  the  blasting  of  the 
Rounddown  Cliff,  and  several  other  works  in  that  neighborhood,  as  well  as  the  erec- 
tion of  swing  britlges  ;ii.  Norwich.  Needham  and  Sonierleyton,  as  the  agent  of  Sir 
Morton  i'eto,  Jiart..  witli  whom,  about  this  lime,  he  became  acfpiainted — his  resolve 
was  no  castle  in  the  air  on  his  ])art  but  a  tirm  determination  to  work  up  by  hard 
industry  and  integrity  to  the  point  which  he  himself  had  chosen,  and  which  he 
allained  within  the  time  he  had  himself  specihed.  A  handsome  testimonial  from  Sir 
\\'illiam  Cubitl,  at  the  termination  of  their  business  relations,  as  to  his  worth,  gave 
him  a  fresh  start  as  it  were  in  his  upward  tendency,  and  the  next  ai)pointment  he 
filled  was  that  of  resident  engineer,  under  Mr.  (J.  1'.  Didder,  on  the  Norfolk  Railway. 
The  trammels  of  daily  routine,  and  on  so  limited  a  scale,  were  not  in  consonance 
with  his  feelings,  and,  retiring  from  thai  jiosition,  we  next  hud  him  as  the  engineer 
of  ihe  l/owestcjft  harbor;  after  which,  in  connection  with  Mr.  James  I'eto,  the 
brother  of  Sir  Morton  Peto,  he  contracted  for  and  built  fifty  miles  of  the  (Ireat 
Northern  Railway,  on  behalf  of  his  principals,  Messrs.  Peto  and  JJelts. 

"  After  so  many  years  of  active  life,  under  which  his  health  suffered  to  some 
considerable  extent,  Mr.  Hodges  determined  on  retiring  into  private  life,  and  with 
that  view  purchased  a  small  estate,  near  Jiagshot,  Surrey,  where  he  resided  ; 
but  no  sooner  had  he  completed  his  arrangements,  in  1S53,  for  enjoying  his  otiuiii 
cum  eiignitate,  than  the  organization  of  the  Grand  Trunk  Railway  Company,  with  its 
Victoria  Rridge  across  the  St.  I.awrence,  afforded  him,  as  the  agent  of  the  contrac- 
tors who  had  undertaken  the  work,  the  ojiportunity  of  handing  his  name  down  to 
posterity,  associated  with  an  undertaking  which  will  last  through  all  time.  Such  an 
opportunity  was  not  to  be  lost  sight  of  by  the  active  and  genial  temperament  of  such 
a  man,  and  it  was  at  once  embraced.  The  good  he  has  done  in  the  field  of  his  labors, 
between  that  time  and  the  present  day,  may  be  summed  up  in  the  words  of  the  late 
iJishop  Fulford,  Metropolitan  Bishop  of  Canada,  who  spoke  them  on  the  occasion  of 
the  workmen  in  the  employ  of  Messrs.  Peto  i!v:  Belts  erecting  a  stone — a  granite

foundations  of  some  of  tlie  Grand  Trunk  Railway  works.  The  Right  Reverend 
gentleman  said  :  '  He  was  tliere  because  he  wished  to  i)ay  the  tribute  of  his  personal 
respect  to  Mr.  Hodges,  to  te  ^ify  his  high  sense  of  tliai  gentleman's  integrity,  and  of 
the  Christian  principle  with  which  he  had  always  acted  towards  all  emi)loyed  under 
him.  He  had  provided  for  their  spiritual  and  educational  supervision  ;  and  his 
otherwise  high  moral  principles,  his  Christian  ])hilanthropy,  and  his  munificent 
liberality  to  the  charities  of  tiieir  city,  would  remain  on  i)erpclual  record.'" 


JACQUES  CARTIER. 

In  this  series  of  Biographical  sketches  we  will  now  present  the  bold  and  intrepid 
mariner,  Jacques  Cartier,  the  discoverer  and  explorer  of  the  country.  The  first 
to  discover  Canada,  and  to  plan  out  a  great  country  ;  the  first  to  colonize  it,  though 
on  a  small  scale  ;  and  the  first  to  take  an  interest  in  and  endeavor  to  advance 
her  interests  and  welfare,  even  at  the  sacrifice  and  expense  of  his  own. 

",To  us  the  career  of  such  a  man  from  whom  we  have  sprung,  and  to  whom  the 
province  owes  its  existence,  is  full  of  material  interest.  He  was  the  founder  and 
discoverer  of  this  country,  and  although  it  was  then  a  vast  wilderness,  and  sparsely 
peopled  by  barbarians,  yet  as  he  glided  up  the  placid  and  limpid  waters  of  the  St. 
Lawrence,  he  was  forcibly  struck  with  the  beauty  and  the  variety  of  the  scenery,  and 
with  the  excellent  spots  which  nature  had  formed  to  be  inhabited  by  more  civilized 
beings.  Cartier  predicted  that  this  would  become  a  great  country  in  time,  and  his 
prediction  has  been  verified.  Consider  the  history  of  the  period,  extending  from 
1534  to  1892,  and  mark  the  result;  it  is  wonderful,  it  is  m.igicai  !  Although  in  one 
sense  it  may  appear  a  long  time  ;  yet  for  an  infant  colony  how  short  does  the  space 
seem  for  the  achievement  of  such  miracles  ?  The  country  was  not  colonized  for  fifty 
years  after  Cartier  first  discovered  it,  and  then  very  sparsely  ;  and  so  it  continued 
for  many  successive  years.  When  the  Cession  took  place,  there  where  '  ery  few 
settlers  or  settlements  in  Upper  Canada  ;  yet,  in  the  present  day,  we  have  cities  and 
towns  and  villages  and  hamlets,  and  cleared  land  and  farms,  from  one  end  of  the 
country  to  the  other ;  commerce  and  trade  allied  togetiier,  and  active  business  car- 
ried on  everywhere  ;  railroads  cross  our  country  at  every  point ;  rivers  are  connected 
by  magnificent  bridges ;  steamers,  propellers  and  river  craft  traverse  our  lakes  and 
rivers  from  the  Gulf  of  St.  Lawrence  to  Lake  Superior ;  valuable  public  works  are 
constructed  so  as  to  make  the  most  distant  points  available  to  trade  ;  and  nearly 
every  nook  and  corner  of  the  province  has  been  explored  and  found  or  made  useful 
for  settlement ;  hidden  treasures  have  been  brought  to  light  that  would  gladden  the 
heart  of  an  Eastern  Nabob.  The  country  is  peopled  by  a  population  of  nearly  five 
millions,  which  will  soon  be  doubled.  The  population  is  becoming  an  enlightened  and 
intelligent  people,  active  and  energetic,  anxious  and  willing  to  advance  the  country  ;.

in  fact,  there  is  no  country  which,  for  its  size  (and  we  might  nearly  put  England  in 
one  of  our  counties),  is  possessed  of  such  superior  privileges  and  such  valuable 
sources  of  wealth.  Who  could  have  foreseen  all  this  as  Cartier  sailed  tranquilly  up 
the  St.  Lawrence?  Did  he,  in  his  ''  mind's  eye,"  think  of  it,  and  raise  up  before 
him  the  hapi)y  setttemcnts,  cleared  lands,  and  large,  thriving  and  gay  cities  and 
towns,  and  crowded  and  teeming  industrious  populations  ?  We  fear  not ;  notwith 
standing  his  i)rediction,  he  could  never  have  dreamed  that  the  country  just  dis- 
covered by  him  could  be  brought  to  such  a  stale  of  perfection  and  magnificence, 
and  become  such  a  source  of  wealth  and  prosperity  to  the  nation  tliat  held  it  ;  yet, 
such  is  the  case,  and  the  name  of  Cartier  will  undoubtedly  be  ever  allied  with  the 
discovery  of  this  country,  and  be  entwined  in  unison  with  that  of  Champlain,  as  our 
national  benefactors,  and  as  the  establishers  of  a  young  and  vigorous  nation." 

Unfortunately,  in  this  present  sketch,  we  are  unable  to  give  any  more  informa- 
tion concerning  the  interesting  and  erratic  history  of  the  adventurous  navigator  than 
has  already  been  given  in  several  biographical  works. 

He  was  celebrated  in  France  as  an  enterprising  mariner  and  pilot,  and  was  a 
native  of  St.  Malo,  .\fter  the  voyage  of  the  Cabots,  who  discovered  Newfoundland 
and  the  mouth  of  the  St.  Lawrence,  the  French  perceived  the  value  of  the  recent 
discoveries  ;  and  in  a  iew  years  began  the  cod  fishery  upon  the  banks  of  Newfound- 
land, The  Baron  de  Levis  is  said  to  have  discovered  a  part  of  Canada  about  15 18. 
In  1524,  John  \'eranzza,  a  Florentine  in  the  service  of  France,  ranged  the  coast  of 
the  new  continent  from  Florida  to  Newfoundland.  From  a  subsequent  voyage,  in 
1525,  he  never  retu«rned,  and  it  is  supposed  that  he  was  cut  to  pieces,  and  devoured 
by  the  savages.  His  fate  discouraged  other  attempts  to  discover  the  new  world,  till 
the  importance  of  having  a  colony  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  fishing  banks  induced 
Francis  L  to  sent  out  Cartier  in  1534.  That  monarch,  tradition  has  it,  said:  "  The 
Kings  of  Spain  and  Portugal  are  taking  possession  of  the  new  world,  without  giving 
me  a  part ;  1  should  be  glad  to  see  the  article  in  Adam's  last  will  which  gives  them 
the  whole  of  the  fine  continent  of  America."  Cartier  sailed  from  St.  Malo  on  the 
20th  April,  with  two  ships  of  sixty  tons,  and  one  hundred  and  twenty-two  men.  On 
the  loth  of  May  he  came  in  sight  of  Bonavista,  on  the  Island  of  Newfoundland  ;  but 
the  ice  obliged  him  to  go  to  the  south,  and  he  entered  a  harbor  at  a  distance  of  five 
leagues,  to  which  he  gave  the  name  of  St.  Catherine.  As  soon  as  the  season  would 
permit,  he  sailed  northward  and  entered  the  Straits  of  Belleisle.  In  this  voyage  he 
visited  the  greater  part  of  the  coast  which  surrounds  the  Gulf  of  St.  Lawrence,  and 
took  possession  of  the  country  in  the  name  of  the  king ;  he  discovered  a  bay,  which 
he  called  Baie  des  Chaleurs,  on  accomit  of  the  sultry  weather  which  he  there  expe- 
rienced. He  sailed  so  far  into  the  great  liver,  afterwards  called  the  St.  Lawrence,  as 
to  discover  land  on  the  opposite  side.  15th  August,  he  set  sail  on  his  return  to 
France,  and  arrived  at  St.  Malo  on  the  5th  of  September. 

When  his  discoveries  were  known  in  France,  it  was  determined  to  make  a  settle- 
ment in  that  part  of  America  which  he  had  visited.     Accordingly,  in  the  following 


39©  GAZKTTEER   OP   MONTREAL. 

year,  he  received  a  more  ample  commission,  and  was  equipped  with  tliree  vessels. 
When  he  was  ready  to  depart,  he  went  to  the  Cathedral  Church  with  his  whole  com- 
pany, and  the  bishop  gave  them  his  benediction.  He  sailed  19th  May,  1535.  He 
encountered  a  severe  storm  on  his  passage  ;  but  in  July  he  reached  the  destined  port. 
He  entered  the  Gulf,  as  in  the  preceding  year,  being  accompanied  by  a  number  of 
young  men  of  distinction.  He  sailed  up  the  St.  I^awrencc,  and  discovered  r  n  island, 
which  lie  named  L' Isle  de  Bacchus.,  but  which  is  now  called  Orleans,  in  the  neigh- 
borhood of  Quebec.  This  island  was  full  of  inhabitants,  who  subsisted  by  fishing, 
etc.  He  went  on  shore,  and  the  native  Indians  brought  him  Indian  corn  for  his 
refreshment.  With  his  pinnace  and  two  boats  he  proceeded  up  the  river  as  far  as 
Hochelaga,  a  settlement  upon  an  island,  which  he  called  Mont  Royal,  the  Royal 
Mount  now  called  Montreal.  In  this  Indian  town  were  about  fifty  long  huts,  built  with 
stakes,  and  covered  with  bark.  The  people  lived  mostly  by  fishing  and  tillage.  They 
had  corn,  beans,  squashes  and  pumpkins.  In  two  or  three  days  he  set  out  on  his 
return,  and  arrived  4th  October  at  St.  Croix,  not  far  from  Quebec,  now  called 
Jacques  Cartier's  river.  Here  he  passed  the  winter.  In  December  the  scurvy  began 
to  make  its  appearance  among  the  natives  ;  and,  in  a  short  time,  Cartier's  company 
were  seized  by  the  disorder.  By  the  middle  of  February,  of  one  hundred  and  ten 
persons,  fifty  were  sick  at  once,  and  eight  or  ten  had  died.  In  this  extremity  he 
appointed  a  day  of  humiliation,  A  crucifix  was  placed  on  a  tree;  a  procession  of 
those  who  were  able  to  walk  was  formed,  and  at  the  close  of  the  devotional  exer- 
cises, Cartier  made  a  vow,  that  "  if  it  should  please  God  to  permit  him  to  return  to 
France,  he  would  go  in  pilgrimage  to  Our  Lady  of  Roquemado,"  The  sick  were  all 
healed  by  using  a  medicine,  which  was  employed  with  success  by  the  natives.  This 
was  a  decoction  of  the  leaves  and  bark  of  a  tree.  The  liquor  was  drank  every  other 
day,  and  an  external  application  was  made  to  the  legs.  Charlevoix  says  the  tree  was 
that  which  yielded  turpentine,  and  Dr.  Belknap  thinks  it  was  the  spruce  i)ine.  In 
May,  Cartier  set  sail  on  his  return  to  France,  carrying  off  with  him  Donacona,  the 
Indian  king  of  the  country,  and  nine  other  natives,  all  of  whom,  except  a  little  girl, 
died  in  France.     He  arrived  af  St.  Malo,  July  6th,  1536. 

At  the  end  of  four  years,  a  third  expedition  was  projected.  Francois  de  la 
Roque,  Lord  of  Roberval,  was  commissioned  by  the  king  as  his  Lieutenant  Governor 
in  Canada ;  and  Cartier  was  appointed  his  pilot,  with  the  command  of  five  ships. 
His  c  mimission,  which  may  be  seen  in  Hazard's  collection,  was  dated  October  17th, 
1540.  He  sailed,  however.  May  23rd,  1540,  to  Newfoundland  and  Canada.  August 
23rd,  he  arrived  at  the  haven  of  St.  Croix,  in  the  River  St.  Lawrence  ;  about  four 
leagues  above  that  place,  on  a  cliff,  at  the  east  side  of  the  mouth  of  a  small  river, 
he  built  a  fort,  which  he  called  Charlesbourg ;  this  was  near  Quebec.  In  the  spring 
of  1542,  he  determined  to  return  to  France,  and  accordingly  in  June  he  arrivea  at 
St.  John's,  in  Newfoundland,  on  his  way  home.  Here  he  met  Roberval,  who  did 
not  accompany  him  in  his  voyage,  and  had  been  detained  till  this  time.  He  was 
ordered  to  return  to  Canada,  but  he  chose  to  pursue  his  voyage  to  France,  and 


GAZETTEER   OF   MONTREAL.  39I 

sailed  out  of  the  harbor  privately  in  the  night.  Roberval  attempted  to  establish  a 
colony,  but  it  was  soon  broken  uj),  and  the  French  did  not  establish  themselves 
permanently  in  Canada  till  after  the  expiration  of  half  a  century. 

Cartier  published  memoirs  of  Canada  after  his  second  voyage.  The  names 
which  he  gave  to  islands,  rivers,  etc.,  are  now  entirely  changed.  In  this  work  he 
shews  that  he  possessed  a  large  share  of  the  credulity  and  exaggeration  of  travellers. 
Being  one  day  in  the  chase,  he  says,  he  pursued  a  beast  which  had  but  two  legs,  and 
which  ran  with  astonishing  rapidity.  This  strange  animal  was  probably  an  Indian, 
clothed  with  the  skin  of  some  wild  beast.  He  speaks  also  of  human  monsters  of 
different  kinds,  uf  which  accounts  had  been  given  him;  some  of  them  lived  without 
eating. 

HON.  LOUIS  N.  MORIX. 

Mr.  Morin  was  born  at  Lavaltrie,  in  the  County  of  Berlhier,  on  the  North  Shore  of 
the  St.  Lawrence,  on  the  21st  of  January,  1832.  He  entered  L'Assomption  College 
in  1842,  where  he  followed  the  ordinary  course  of  education  in  that  institution  until 
July,  1849  ;  '1^  commenced  the  study  of  the  Law  in  1850,  in  the  office  of  Messrs. 
Cherrier,  Dorion  &amp;  Dorion,  of  Montreal ;  also,  followed  a  course  of  lectures  under 
the  late  Hon.  D.  B.  Viger,  and  on  the  7th  of  February,  1853,  was  admitted  to  the 
Bar,  and  highly  complimented  for  his  creditable  examination  by  the  late  T.  Peltier, 
I'-sq.,  baltonier  of  the  Bar  of  the  Montreal  District.  The  deceased  gentleman,  it  is 
said,  used  these  words  in  conclusion  on  addressing  M.  Morin  :  "  I  hope,  with  the 
talents  which  Providence  has  bestowed  upon  you,  you  will  not  fail  to  do  honor  to  your 
country."  Mr.  Morin  early  took  an  interest  in  politics,  and  at  the  General  Elections 
of  1854  he  was  solicited  to  run  for  the  County  of  L'Assomption,  but  was  defeated. 
A  vacancy  having  occurred  during  the  same  Parliament  for  the  County  of  Terrebonne, 
adjoining  L'Assomption,  Mr.  Morin  presented  himself,  and  wasrjturned  by  acclama- 
tion, but  scarcely  was  his  election  concluded  when  Parliament  was  dissolved ;  this 
happened  in  1857.  When  the  next  General  Election  took  place,  Mr.  Morin  again 
became  a  candidate  for  the  same  constituency,  and  was  again  unanimously  elected. 
When  the  new  Parliament  met  in  February,  1858,  a  high  honor  awaited  Mr.  Morin  in 
his  being  selected  from  the  whole  batch  of  newly  returned  members  to  move  the 
Reply  to  the  Speech  from  the  Throne.  During  that  Session  and  the  succeeding  one, 
he  took  an  active  part  in  all  the  proceedings  of  the  House,  and  being  an  excellent 
speaker  and  possessed  of  rare  talenis  for  a  young  member,  he  exercised  considerable 
influence  in  the  Assembly.  Previously  to  this  he  was  connected  with  the  La  Patrie 
newspaper,  the  first  French  journal  started  on  the  daily  principle  in  Canada,  and 
edited  by  some  of  the  cleverest  writers  among  the  French  Canadian  portion  of  the 
community. 

In  January,  i860,  Mr.  Morin  was  appointed  to  the  vacant  Solicitor-Generalship 
for  Lower  Canada,  with  a  seat  in  the  Cabinet.  The  political  world  was  somewhat 
surprised  to  hear  of  this  appointment,  Mr.  Morin  being  in  the  opinion  of  many  too 
young  for  an  Executive  Councillor  and  Queen's  Counsel,  so  that  members  of  the 


302  GAZETTEER   OF   MONTREAL. 

Other  party  raised  various  objections,  all  of  which  were  eitlier  satisfactorily  answered 
or  successfully  overcome.  The  honorable  gentleman  proved  that,  notwithstand- 
ing his  age,  he  was  none  the  less  tilting  and  capable  of  sustaining  the  duties  of  his 
appointment.  When  we  add  that  he  was  as  brave  as  he  was  talented,  we  have  said 
sufficient.  In  the  General  Election  which  followed  he  was  defeated  in  Terrebonne,  but 
returned  for  Laval  by  a  large  majority.  After  a  busy  and  eventful  life  he  died  some 
years  ago. 

LIEUT.  CHARLES    McKAY. 

"Charlfs  McKay  was  the  youngest  but  one  of  four  sons  who  survived  their  father, 
the  late  Hon.  Thomas  McKay,  M.L.C.,  of  Ottawa.  He  was  born  in  Montreal,  21st 
April,  1836,  and  educated  at  the  High  School  of  that  city,  and  also  in  Edinburgh, 
Scotland,  where  he  was  at  his  studies  when  the  Crimean  War  created  so  much 
military  ardor  amongst  the  youth  of  Britain.  As  a  boy,  he  was  remarkable  for  his 
steadiness,  self-control  and  self-reliance,  and  a  judgment  beyond  his  years.  Possessed 
of  great  personal  strength  and  a  fearless  disposition,  he  was  slow  to  anger;  amiable 
and  gentle  in  his  deportment,  and  though  not  wanting  in  means  or  opportunity  for 
indulgence,  was  temperate  in  all  things, 

"  At  his  urgent  request,  while  at  school  in  Edinburgh,  a  commission  was  obtained 
for  him  in  a  line  regiment,  and  on  May  10,  1855,  he  was  gazetted  to  the  97th 
Regiment,  then  one  of  the  strongest  in  the  Crimea,  the  depot  of  which  was  at  Preston, 
where  he  joined.  So  rapid  was  promotion  in  consequence  of  death  vacancies,  that 
on  2ist  December  of  the  same  year  lie  became  Lieutenant,  without  purchase,  and 
embarked  for  Malta,  where  reinforcements  were  located  to  acclimatize  them  for  the 
Crimea.  In  1856,  he  sailed  for  Balaklava,  where  he  arrived  on  the  nth  March, 
after  the  fall  of  Sebastopol  and  the  cessaticii  of  hostilities.  On  his  return  from  the 
Crimea,  he  paid  a  visit  to  his  family  in  Canada,  which  was  abruptly  terminated  by 
the  breaking  out  of  the  Sepoy  Rebellion,  in  1857.  He  sailed  with  his  regiment  from 
Spithead,  5th  August,  1857,  arrived  at  Calcutta  in  November,  and  was  sent  up  in 
December  to  Benares,  where  his  regiment  formed  part  of  General  Frank's  division, 
in  the  march  to  Lucknow.  At  Benares,  he  was  laid  up  with  fever  on  his  arrival  on 
the  i6th  December,  and  did  not  come  off  the  sick  list  until  the  2nd  of  January.  On 
the  4th,  the  regiment  marched  to  Babudpoor.  During  this  period  his  diary  shows 
hard  work — up  at  four  every  morning,  and  sometimes  on  his  feet  till  midnight ;  fre- 
quently going  the  whole  day  without  food,  and  sleeping  where  only  soldiers  have  to 
sleep.  On  the  8th,  they  were  joined  by  two  Ghoorka  Regiments  at  Manccahoo. 
On  the  22nd,  they  came  up  with  the  Rebels  at  Secundia,  Coming  in  from  outlying 
pickets,  on  the  morning  of  the  23rd  January,  yo'  ng  McKay  was  marched  with  the 
column  to  attack  the  Sepoys  who  were  strongly  fortified  in  the  midst  of  a  thick 
jungle."  He  was  killed  in  the  Indian  Mutiny,  to  the  extreme  regret  both  of  men 
and  officers  who  greatly  loved  the  young  hero.  His  father's  house  is  now  the 
gubernatorial  residence,  "  Rideau  Hall,"  of  the  Governors  of  the  Dominion  of 
Canada.

COLONEL  C.  AIMIt;  DUGAS,  J.P. 

TiiK  subject  of  this  skctcli,  our  efficient  and  painstaking  Police  Magistrate,  was  born  on 
the  nth  February,  1845,  ^^  ^^-  Kemi,  near  Montreal.  His  parents  were  Adolphe  Dugas, 
M.I).,  and  iiis  mother  was  Clothilde  Ohgny.  His  father  figured  rather  prominently 
.n  the  troubles  of  1S37-38,  and  war,  for  some  time  incarcerated  in  the  (laol  for  High 
I'reason.  His  comniiiment  is  dated  ist  March,  1837,  in  which  he  is  declared  guilty 
of  High  Treason.  I  find  that  on  the  23rd  of  the  following  June,  he  must  have  con- 
vinced the  authorities  that  he  could  be  admitted  to  bail,  as  on  that  day  his  name  is 
mentioned  as  having  been  discharged  from  prison  in  a  paper  headed  thus  :  "  Discharge 
of  various  .State  Prisoners,"  and  with  him  were  discharged  some  well-known  names, 
such  as  Joseph  Gervais,  Jean  Jabot,  Damien  Masson,  Joseph  Tongas,  Leon  Breau 
and  Felix  Cardinal      The  paper  was  signed  by  George  Pyke,  J.K.B. 

The  subject  of  our  present  sketch  was  educated  in  the  Montreal  College.  He 
entered  the  Law  office  of  the  Chief  Justice  at  that  time,  and  also  passed  some  time  in 
the  offices  of  Hon.  J.  J.  C.  Abbott,  now  Premier  of  the  Dominion,  and  of  the  Lorangers. 
He  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  in  May,  1868,  and  became  co-partner  with  D.  Girouard 
for  five  years,  and  also  with  A.  B.  Longpr6,  late  Prothonotary  for  the  same  ])eriod. 
He  was  appointed  President  of  the  Court  of  General  Sessions  of  the  Peace,  Octobe'", 
1878,  which  lie  still  holds. 

Amidst  all  his  multiplicity  of  legal  business  he  devoted  himself  a  little  to  jjolitics 
and  ran  for  Hochelaga  County  in  the  interests  of  the  Liberal  patty  to  which  he  had 
belonged,  but  was  defeated  in  the  elections  of  1878.  He  has  been  connected  with  the 
Volunteers  since  1879  as  Major  and  then  Colonel  of  the  65th  Battalion,  Mount  Royal 
Rifles.  With  this  Battalion  as  Major,  he  went  to  the  North-West  Rebellion  in  1885. 
Was  stationed  at  Calgary,  Battleford  and  Fort  Pitt.  After  the  return  of  the  Battalion 
m  1886,  he  was  promoted  to  the  rank  of  Colonel,  which  he  held  till  lately,  when  he 
resigned  on  account  of  pressing  legal  and  magisterial  duties.  He  had  succeeded 
Colonel  Ouimet,  now  one  of  the  Privy  Council  of  the  Dominion.  The  Judge  of 
Quarter  Sessions  is  much  interested  in  developing  the  mines  of  this  country, 
especially  near  St.  Jerome,  where  we  all  know  that  in  the  Laurentian  Range  of 
Mountains  all  the  minerals  most  required  by  man  are  found  in  abundance.  This 
developing  the  resources  of  Canada  is  one  of  the  most  patriotic  ways  of  raising  her 
to  a  high  standard  among  the  nations.  The  vast  Laurentian  Range  was  the  first  part 
of  the  earth  that  rose  to  solidity  in  the  bygone  ages  of  Creation,  and  in  these  rocks 
we  find  great  deposits  of  different  minerals  far  beyond  that  of  any  othe*-  country. 
All  the  economic  minerals,  save  limestone,  are  found  in  abundance,  and  gold,  silver, 
nickel,  iron,  asbestos,  mica,  plumbago,  and  a  long  list  even  of  gems  and  ornamental 
stones  are  all  to  be  procured  in  that  grand  old  Laurentian  Range.  May  Judge  Dugas 
and  all  others  who  are  endeavoring  to  develop  such,  be  well  rewarded.  I  must  state 
how  some  can  be  rewarded  in  these  mining  probabilities  by  instancing  the  actual 
record  of  one  such  which  took  place  a  year  or  two  ago.     The  Author's  Church

Warden,  an  official  of  ihc  C.  P.  R.,  was  s'jut  from  Hochclaga  to  Sudbury. 
He,  in  connection  with  a  friend,  bought  the  mining  rights  of  an  Indian  of  a  piece 
of  ground  for  a  few  dollars  which  showed  copper  deposits  in  abundance.  'I  hey  sold 
ii  t'^  a  company  for  $40,000.  The  company  is  now  the  (Ireat  Nickel  Company  of 
Sudbury,  as  this  mineral  was  found  to  be  associated  fifty  per  cent,  wiiji  the  copper. 
Lately  this  company  were  offered  by  another  Association  of  the  I'nitcd  States  one 
million  dollars  for  half  their  rights  and  refused.  No  wonder  that  the  Government  at 
Quebec  lately  gave  orders  that  no  more  Government  lands  should  be  sold  at  iheir 
previous  cheap  rates.  Canada  from  Labrador,  where  Judge  Dugas  has  excellent  mines 
of  mica,  etc.,  to  the  shores  of  the  Arctic  Ocean  and  the  blue  Pacific  in  the  West,  i)os- 
sesses  an  extraordinary  amount  of  all  these  minerals  and  gems,  and  in  the  future  they 
will  be  the  means  rf  raising  her  high  j'mong  the  nations  of  the  world.

CHAMPLAIN. 

"  Samuel  de  Champi.ain,  a  name  rendered  illustrious  in  our  annals  from  his  services 
in  not  only  founding  the  ancient  C'ity  of  Quebec,  but  in  establishing  Canada  ;  in 
spreading  civilization,  repelling  the  attack  of  tlie  hordes  of  Indians,  and  thus  saving 
the  lives  of  the  early  French  settlers  ;  in  exploring  the  country  and  its  valuable 
resources,  and  thus  bringing  its  name  conspicuously  before  not  only  his  own  nation, 
but  many  others. 

"  He  was  of  a  noblefamily  of  Brouage,  in  the  Province  of  Saintonge,  France.  He 
commanded  a  vessel,  in  which  he  made  a  voyage  to  the  F^ast  Indies,  about  the  year 
1600,  and  acquired  a  high  reputation  as  an  able  and  experienced  officer.  After  an  ab- 
sence of  two  years  and  a  half,  he  returned  to  France,  at  a  time  when  it  was  proposed 
to  prosecute  the  discoveries  whicli  had  been  commenced  in  Canada  by  Cartier.  The 
Marquis  de  la  Roche  and  Chauvin,  Governors  of  Canada,  had  endeavored  to  estab- 
lish a  Colony,  and  the  latter  was  succeeded  by  De  Chaite,  who  engaged  Champlain 
in  his  service  in  1603.  Champlain  sailed  March  16,  accompanied  by  Pontgrave, 
who  had  made  many  voyages  to  Tadousac,  at  the  entrance  of  the  Saguenay  into  the 
St.  Lawrence.  After  their  arrival  at  this  pi  ice,  25th  of  May,  they  in  a  light  batteau 
ascended  the  St.  Lawrence  to  the  Falls  of  St.  Louis,  which  bounded  the  discoveries 
of  Cartier  in  1535.  This  was  not  far  from  Hochelaga  ;  but  that  Indian  settlement 
was  not  now  in  existence.  After  making  many  inquiries  of  the  natives,  and  explor- 
ing much  of  the  country  along  the  St.  Lawrence,  he  sailed  for  France  in  August. 
On  his  arrival  in  September  he  found  that  De  Cliatte  was  dead,  and  his  commission 
as  Lieutenant-General  of  Canada  given  to  the  Sieur  De  Monts.  This  nobleman 
engaged  him  as  his  pilot  in  another  voyage  to  the  New  World. 


CAZETTI'.KR   OF   MONTREAL.  395 

"  Champlain  sailed  upon  his  second  voyage,  March  7th,  1604,  and  arrived  at 
Acadia,  May  6th.  After  being  employed  about  a  month  in  the  long  boat  visiting 
the  coast,  in  order  to  find  a  proper  situation  for  a  settlement,  he  pitched  upon  a  small 
island  about  twenty  leagues  to  the  westward  of  St.  John's  River,  and  about  half  a 
league  in  circumference.  To  this  island  De  Monts,  after  his  arrival  at  the  place, 
gave  the  name  of  St.  Croix.  It  li^s  in  the  river  of  the  same  name,  which  divides  the 
United  Slates  from  the  Province  of  New  IJrunswick.  During  tiie  winter  Champlain 
was  occupied  in  exploring  the  country,  and  he  went  as  far  as  Cape  Cod,  where  he 
gave  the  name  of  Malebarre  to  a  poiiil  of  land,  on  account  of  the  imminent  danger 
of  running  aground  near  it  with  his  bark.  Next  year  he  pursued  his  discoveries, 
though  he  did  not  pass  mire  thin  ten  or  [\vAvc  lea.;ue-i  b 'yond  Maleha- •.!. 

"  In  1607,  he  was  sent  out  on  aiiotlier  voyage  to  Tadousac,  accompanied  by 
Pontgrav6.  In  July,  1608,  he  laid  the  foundation  of  (Quebec.  He  was  a  man  who 
did  not  embarrass  himself  with  commerce,  and  who  felt  no  interest  in  traffic  with  the 
Indians,  which  proved  so  profitable  to  many  engaged  in  it.  Ik'ing  entrusted  with 
the  charge  of  establishing  a  permanent  colony,  he  examined  the  most  eligible  places 
for  settlement,  and  selected  a  spot  upon  the  St.  Lawrence,  at  the  confluence  of  this 
river  and  the  small  river  of  St.  Charles,  about  four  hundred  and  ten  miles  from  the 
sea.  The  river  in  this  place  was  very  much  contracted,  and  it  was  on  this  account 
that  the  natives  called  it  Quebec  (although  various  surmises  are  advanced  by  His- 
torians and  others  as  to  the  origin  of  the  nam--).  Here  he  arrived  on  the  3rd  of  July. 
He  erected  barracks,  cleared  the  ground,  sowed  wheat  and  rye,  and  laid  the  founda- 
tion of  the  "  Gibraltar  of  America."  The  toil  of  subduing  the  wilderness  was  not 
very  acceptable  to  all  his  company  ;  for  some  of  them  conspired  to  put  their  leader 
to  death,  and  to  embark  at  Tadousac  for  France.  The  attempt  to  destroy  him  was 
to  be  made  by  poison  and  by  a  train  of  gunpowder ;  but,  the  apothecary  having  dis- 
covered the  scheme,  one  of  the  conspirators  was  hanged,  and  others  were  condemned 
to  the  galleys.  During  the  winter  his  people  were  afflicted  with  the  scurvy.  Cham- 
plain  sought  after  the  medicine  which  had  been  so  successfully  used  by  Cartier  ;  but 
the  tree,  which  was  called  Auneda,  was  not  now  to  be  found.  From  this  circum- 
stance it  was  concluded  ihat  the  tribe  of  Indians  with  which  Cartier  was  acquainted 
had  been  exterminated  by  their  enemies. 

"In  the  summer  of  the  year  1609,  when  the  Hurohs,  Algonquins,  and  othei.s, 
were  about  to  march  against  their  common  enemy,  the  Iroquois,  Champlain  very 
readily  joined  them;  for  he  had  a  keen  taste  for  adventures;  and  he  hoped,  by  a 
conquest,  to  impress  all  the  Indian  tribes  with  strong  ideas  of  the  power  of  the 
French,  and  to  secure  an  alliance  with  tiiem.  He  did  not  foresee  that  he  should 
force  the  Iroquois,  who  lived  in  what  is  now  called  the  State  of  New  York,  to  seek 
the  protection  of  the  English  and  Dutch.  He  embarked  on  the  river  Sorel,  which 
was  then  called  the  Iroquois,  because  these  savages  usually  descended  by  this  stream 
into  Canada.  At  the  Falls  of  Chambly  he  was  stopped,  and  was  obliged  to  send 
back  hij.boat.     Only  two  Frenchmen  Tetnained  with  him.     He  ascended  with  his 


396  GAZEiTKKR  OK  MONIRKAI,. 

allies  in  the  Indian  canoes  to  the  lake,  to  which  he  gave  his  own  name,  whidi  it 
retains  to  the  present  clay.  The  savages  whom  he  accompanied  Iioped  to  surprise 
the  Iro(]nois  in  the  villages,  hut  they  met  them  unexiiectcdly  upon  the  lake.  After 
gaining  the  land,  it  was  agreed  to  defer  llie  battle  till  the  next  day,  as  the  night  was 
now  ajjproaching.  In  the  morning  of  30th  July,  Champlam  placed  a  party  with  his 
two  Frenchmen  in  a  neighboring  wood,  so  as  to  come  upon  the  enemy  in  flank.  The 
Iroquois,  who  were  about  two  hundred  in  number,  seeing  but  a  handful  of  men, 
were  sure  of  victory.  Hut  as  soon  as  the  battle  began,  Champlain  killed  two  of  their 
chiefs,  who  were  conspicuous  by  their  i)lumes,  by  the  first  discharge  of  his  firelock, 
loaded  with  four  balls.  The  report  and  the  execution  of  the  fire-arms  filled  the 
Iroquois  with  inexpressible  consternation.  'I'hey  were  quickly  put  to  flight,  and  the 
victorious  allies  returned  to  Quebec  with  fifty  s-calps. 

"  In  September,  1609,  Champlain  embarked  with  I'ontgrave  for  France,  leaving 
the  colony  under  the  care  of  a  brave  man,  Peter  Chauvin.  J]ut  he  was  soon  sent  out 
again  to  the  New  World.  He  sailed  from  Honfleur,  April  8,  1610,  and  arrived  at 
Tadousac  on  the  26th.  He  encouraged  the  Montagnais  Indians,  who  lived  at  this 
place,  to  engage  in  a  second  expedition  against  the  Iroquois.  Accordingly,  soon 
after  his  arrival  at  Quebec,  they  sent  him  about  sixty  warriors.  At  the  head  of  these 
and  others  he  proceeded  up  the  river  Sorel.  The  enemy  were  soon  met,  and  after  a 
severe  engagement,  in  which  Champlain  was  wounded  by  an  arrow,  were  entirely 
defeated.  He  arrived  at  Quebec,  from  Montreal,  June  19,  and  landed  at  Rochelle, 
August  II.  After  the  death  of  Henry  IV.  the  interest  of  De  Monts,  in  whose  ser- 
vice Champlain  had  been  engaged,  was  entirely  ruined,  and  the  latter  was  obliged  to 
leave  a  settlement,  which  he  was  commencing  at  Mont  Royal  or  Montreal,  and  tc  go 
again  to  France  in  161 1.  Charles  de  Bourbon,  being  commissioned  by  the  (^ucen 
Regent  Governor  of  New  France,  appointed  Champlain  his  lieutenant,  with  very 
extensive  powers.  He  returned  to  Canada  in  161 2,  was  engaged  in  war  with  the 
Iroquois,  and  made  new  discoveries.  His  voyages  across  the  Atlantic  were  frequent. 
He  was  continued  Lieutenant-Governor  under  that  distinguished  nobleman,  the 
Prince  of  Conde  and  Montmorenci.  In  1615,  his  zeal  for  the  spiritual  interests  of 
the  Indians  induced  him  to  bring  with  him  a  number  of  Jesuit  Fathers,  some  of  wliom 
assisted  him  in  his  warfare.  He  penetrated  to  Lake  Ontario,  and,  being  wounded 
while  assisting  the  Hurons  against  their  enemies,  was  obliged  to  pass  a  whole  winter 
among  them.  When  he  returned  to  Quebec  in  July,  1616,  he  was  received  as  one 
risen  from  the  dead.  In  July,  1629,  he  was  obliged  to  capitulate,  on  account  of  the 
sparseness  of  his  forces,  and  the  exhausted  state  of  his  men  through  famine,  tc  an 
English  armament  under  Sir  David  Kertk.  He  was  carried  to  France  in  an  English 
ship,  and  there  he  found  the  public  sentiment  much  divided  with  regard  to  Canada; 
some  thinking  it  was  not  worth  regaining,  as  it  had  cost  the  Government  vast  sums 
without  bringing  any  returns;  others  deeming  the  fishery  and  fur  trndu  great 
national  objects,  especially  as  a  nursery  for  seamen.  Champlain  exerted  1  nself  to 
effect  the  recovery  of  this  country,  and  Canada  was  restored  by  the  treaty  of  St. 
Germains,  in  1632,  with  Acadia  and  Cape  Breton.

Chainpluin  ihc  Governor.  In  a  short  tinvj  he  was  at  the  head  of  a  new  armaniciit, 
furnislied  witli  a  fresh  recruit  of  Jesuits,  settlers,  as  well  as  all  kinds  of  necessaries 
for  the  welfare  of  the  revived  colony.  His  attention  was  now  engrossed  by  the 
spiritual  interests  of  the  savages,  whom  it  was  his  principal  object  to  bring  to  the 
knowledge  of  the  Christian  religion.  The  number  of  ecclesiastical  missionaries, 
exclusive  of  lay  brothers,  was  now  fifteen,  the  chief  of  whom  were  Le  [eime,  l)c 
None,  Masse  and  Iireb(jeuf.  A  mission  was  established  among  the  llurons;  the 
colony  was  gaining  an  accession  of  numbers  and  strength,  and  an  attempt  was  just 
commencing  to  establish  a  college  in  (Quebec,  when  the  (lovernor  died,  and  was 
succeeded  the  next  year  by  l)e  Montmagny. 

"  Champlain  merited  the  title  of  the  f.ither  of  New  France.  Though  ho  was  cre- 
dulous, he  possessed  an  uncommon  share  of  penetration  and  energy.  His  views 
were  upright ;  and  in  circumstances  of  difficulty,  no  man  could  make  a  better  choice 
of  measures.  He  ])rosecuted  his  enterprises  with  constancy,  and  no  dangers  could 
shake  his  firmness.  His  zeal  for  the  interests  of  his  country  was  ardent  ami  disin- 
terested;  his  heart  was  lender  and  compassionate  towards  the  unhappy;  and  he  was 
more  attentive  to  the  concerns  of  his  friends  than  to  his  own.  He  wa-s  a  faithful 
historian,  a  voyager  who  observed  everything  with  attention,  skilful  in  geometry,  and 
an  experienced  seaman.  He  appears  to  have  been  fond  of  good  cheer  ;  for,  in  the 
early  part  of  his  residence  in  Canada,  he  established  with  his  associates  an  order, 
'  De  bon  temps,'  which  contributed  not  a  little  to  the  gratification  of  the  palate. 
By  this  ordt;r  every  one  of  the  same  table  was  in  his  turn  to  be  steward  and  caterer 
for  a  day.  He  was  careful  by  hunting  to  make  a  suitable  provision,  and  at  supper, 
when  the  cook  had  made  everything  ready,  he  marched  at  the  head  of  the  company 
with  a  napkin  over  his  shoulder,  having  also  the  staff  of  office,  and  wearing  the  collar 
of  his  order,  and  was  followed  by  his  associates,  each  of  whom  bore  a  dish.  .A.I  the 
close  of  the  banquet  he  pledged  his  successor  in  a  bumper  of  wine,  and  resigned  to 
him  the  collar  and  staff.  It  may  not  be  easy  to  justify  Champlain  in  taking  an 
active  part  in  the  war  against  the  Irocjuois.  It  is  even  supposed  by  some,  that 
his  love  of  adventures  led  him  to  arouse  the  spirit  of  the  Hurons  and  to  excite 
them  to  war.  His  zeal  for  the  propagation  of  religion  among  the  savages  was 
so  great,  that  he  used  to  say  '  that  the  salvation  of  one  soul  was  of  more  value 
than  the  conquest  of  an  empire;'  and  that  'kings  ought  not  to  think  of  extend- 
ing their  authority  over  idolatrous  nations,  except  for  the  purpose  of  subjecting 
them  to  Jesus  Christ.' 

"  He  published  an  account  of  his  first  voyages  in  i6i3,in  4to ;  and  a  contin- 
uation in  1620,  in  8vo.  He  published  an  edition  to  these  in  1632,  in  one  volume, 
entitled,  Les  voyages  de  la  Noiivelle  France.,  occidentale,  dite  Canada,  in  4to.  This

M.  H.   SANBORN. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  came  from  the  Eastern  Townships,  where  such  a  number 
of  our  Montreal  men  have  hailed  from.  He  was  a  notary  by  profession,  having  been 
admitted  to  practice  in  1850.  After  five  years  of  notarial  work  in  the  City,  he 
was  appointed  Deputy  Sheriff  in  1855,  by  the  late  Sheriff  Boston,  wliich  position 
he  held  to  his  death.  He  was  a  man  of  retiring  disposition,  a  good  Churchman 
and  one  of  the  most  constant  attcnders  at  the  Diocesan  Synod  of  Montreal,  where 
he  was  held  in  much  esteem,  and  where  his  work  and  notarial  lore  made  him  a 
valuable  member  in  all  things  pertaining  to  the  real  estate  of  the  Diocese.  He  pub- 
lished a  most  useful  book  entitled,  "  Hand  Book  for  Sheriffs  and  Bailiffs  of  the  Pro- 
vince of  Quebec."  He  was  the  author  of  other  pamphlets.  Mr.  Sanborn  was  a 
great  musician,  and  gave  a  good  deal  of  time  to  the  Sol  Fa  system,  and  the  systems 
which  in  his  day  were  coming  into  vogue.  After  an  honorable  career,  a  stainless 
life  and  a  Cliristian  course,  he  died  universally  lamented  by  both  Bench  and  Bar  and 
a  large  circle  of  citizens. 

HON.  WIL:  lAM  McGILLIVRAY. 

This  name  is  an  important  one  in  the  annals  of  the  Province  as  well  as  in  its  public 
affairs.  We  find  him  in  1806  the  head  of  the  large  firm  of  MacTavish,  McGillivray 
&amp;  Co.  At  this  time  a  fierce  conflict  was  being  carried  on  by  the  Fur  Company 
which  they  represented  and  Lord  Selkirk,  in  regard  to  the  possession  of  the  Red 
River  District.  At  this  time  Lord  Selkirk  requested  Sir  Gordon  Drummond,  the 
then  Administrator  of  the  Government,  to  send  a  small  military  force  to  jjrotect  the 
Red  River  or  Selkirk  Colonists  from  the  annoyances  and  persecutions  of  the  North 
West  Company.  It  was  refused,  and  greatly  owing  to  McGillivray's  influence  as  a 
member  of  the  Executive  Council  of  the  Province. 

Fort  William,  one  of  the  chief  posts,  was  called  after  him,  and  it  became  the 
headquarters  of  the  North  West  Company's  operations.  It  is  supposed  that  here 
the  orders  emanated  which  were  carried  out  in  181 5,  of  attacking  the  Colony  of 
Lord  Selkirk.  For  this  brutal  and  unwarrantable  outbreak  and  attack  Mr.  McGilli- 
vray, Kenneth  Mackenzie  and  Simon  Eraser  were  all  put  under  arrest,  August,  1816, 
by  Lord  Selkirk,  who  had  been  invested  with  magisterial  powers.  They  were 
arraigned  as  responsible  for  the  death  of  Governor  Semple  and  the  almost  total  de- 
struction of  the  Red  River  Settlement  the  previous  June.  As  this  company  was  at 
this  time  all  powerful  in  Quebec,  and  the  members  of  it  almost  completely  controlled 
the  acts  of  the  Government  and  the  Governor  in  Council,  the  issue  was  at  last  in 
favor  of  McGillivray  and  his  colleagues.  The  well-known  Judge  Reid  had  married  the 
sister  of  the  subject  of  our  sketch,  and  this  mighty  influence  had  something  to  do  with 
the  final  issue.  In  1802,  he  received  a  grant  of  1 1,550  acres  of  land  in  the  township 
of  Inverness  from  the  Governor,  Sir  R.  S.  Milnes.  He  will  ever  be  remembered 
as  the  Lieut.-Col.  of  the  cor[)s  of  Voyageurs  who  captured  Detroit  in  the  War 
of  i8i2.  The  river  in  the  North  West  also  commemorates  his  name.  After  a  most 
romantic  and  interesting  life  he  died  in  Montreal  in  the  year  1825.

HON.  TOUHSAINT  A.  K.  LAFLAMME,  D.C.L. 

ToussAiNT  Antoini;  Rodoli'HK  Laklammk,  Q.C,  D.C.L. ,  was  born  in  Montreal  in 
1828.    His  fiitlier,  Toussaint  Laflamme,  a  nicrcliant  of  good  standing  in  this  city,  was 
of  a  family  that  originally  came  from  Normandy,  and  his  mother,  Marguerit.- Suzanne 
Thibaudeaii,  was  descended   from  one  of   the   banished   Acadian  families,  and  an 
uncle  of  hers  founded  the  town  of  Thibaudeauville  in  Louisiana,  and  became  a  member 
of  the  United  States  Congress.   Having  completed  his  studies  at  Montreal  College,  he 
entered  on  the  study   of  Law  in  Mr.  Drummond's  office,  afterwards  Judge  of  the 
Court  of  Queen's  Bench.     In  those  days  the  democratic  ideas  which  were  agitating 
the  world  had  penetrated  even  to  the  banks  of  the  St.  Lawrence,  and  in  Montreal 
they  found  adherents  in  a  band  of  young  men  of  talent,  among  whom  were  Messrs. 
Papin,    Laberge,  Labreche,  Viger,  Eric  Dorion,   Wilfred  Dorion,  Gustave  Papineau, 
son  of  the  Hen.   L.   J.  Papineau,   Casimir    Papineau,    M.  Lanctot,  Joseph   Doutre, 
Charles  Daoust,  etc.,   several  of  whom  had  come  prominently  before  the  country  in 
connection  with  the  Listitut  Canadian  and  public  meetings.     To  further  their  j)oliti- 
cal  aspirations,  which  were   considerably  in  advance  of  their  time,  they  founded  the 
noted  journal   L'Avenir,  which,  during  its  existence,  demonstrated  the  talent  and 
fearlessness  in  handling  political  questions  which  our  French-Canadian  brethren  are 
capable  of  when   not  overpowered  by  ecclesiastical  influences.     Occupying  a  fore- 
most place  in  this  phalanx  of  young  politicians,  who  then  formed  the  vanguard  of 
the   great  Liberal  party,   stood  Mr.  Laflamme,  who  was  elected  President  of  the 
Institut  Canadien  in  1847,  when  only  nineteen  years  of  age,  and  was  one  of  the  chief 
editors  o{ L'Avenir,  and  the  writer  of  several  of  its  most  striking  articles.  Chimerical 
as  many  of  the  aspirations  exjjressed  in  that  paper  are  said  to  have  been,  it  is  claimed 
that  most  of  the  leading  reforms  advocated  by  it,   such  as  the  repeal  of  Seigniorial 
rights,  decentralization  of  the  Judiciary  and  the  Colonization  project  of  1848,   have 
been  taken  up  and  carried  by  the  Conservatives,  assisted  in  the  latter  item  by  the 
clergy.     Nevertheless,   tiese  young  Reformers  were  looked  on  with  no  friendly  eye 
by  the  hierarchy  and  priesthood,  who  labored  to  prejudice  the  minds  of  the  people 
against  them. 

Mr.  Laflamme  was  called  to  the  Bar  of  Lower  Canada  in  1848,  and  at  first 
practised  in  partnership  with  the  late  Mr.  Laberge.  In  a  fe.v  years  he  acquired  a 
splendid  practice,  bringing  him  from  four  to  five  thousand  pounds  per  annum.  He 
is  said  to  be.  a  born  lawyer,  thoroughly  versed  in  all  the  details  and  all  the  depart- 
ments of  his  profession.  In  some  years  he  has  had  as  many  as  four  hundred  cases 
in  the  Superior  Court  alone.  He  is  frequently  charged  with  very  important  cases 
before  the  Court  of  Appeals  and  the  British  Privy  Council.  Among  other  noted 
cases  he  acted  as  counsel  from  1857  to  1858  for  the  Seigneurs,  who  claimed  their 
indemnity  in  virtue  of  the  Seigniorial  Act,  having  opposed  to  him  Mr.  Doutre,  coun- 
sel for  the  Censitaires  and  a  foeman  worthy  of  his  steel,  the  contest  in  this  case  be- 
ing afterwards  prolonged  in  the  press.     Mr.  Laflamme  was  created  a  Queen's  Coun-

sel  in  1863,  and  in  1865  acted  along  with  Messrs.  Abbott  and  Kerr  for  the  defence 
in  the  trial  of  the  St.  Albans  Haiders.  He  was  at  one  time  Professor  of  the  Law  of 
Real  Estate  in  McGill  College,  from  which  he  received  the  degree  of  B.C.L.  in 
1856,  and  that  of  D.C.L.  in  1873.  He  was  twice  elected  Batonnier  for  the  Bar  of 
Montreal.  He  was  offered  a  Judgeship  in  the  Supreme  Court  in  1875,  but  declined 
it.  Although  unceasingly  zealous  in  the  service  of  the  Liberal  party  by  tongue  and 
pen.  he  did  not  seek  Parliamentary  honors  till  the  General  Elections  of  1872,  when 
he  was  elected  representative  in  the  House  of  Commons  for  Jacques  Cartier  County, 
being  re-elected  by  acclamation  for  the  same  constituency  in  1874,  and  in  1876  he 
was  sworn  in  member  of  the  Privy  Council  as  the  Minister  of  Inland  Revenue.  On 
the  8th  of  June  succeeding  he  became  Minister  of  Justice,  and  in  this  capacity  intro- 
duced many  wholesome  measures  which  have  since  become  law.  For  years  past  he 
has  given  up  all  politics  and  attended  to  the  increasing  duties  of  his  profession. 

WILLIAM  WAINWRIGIIT, 

Assistant  Manager  Grand  Trunk  Railway,  Montreal,  like  not  a  few  of  the  prom- 
inent railway  men  of  North  America,  is  a  native  of  England.  He  was  born  in  a 
city  which,  from  its  situation  and  industrial  and  commercial  importance,  could  not 
fail  to  be  closely  associated  with  whatever  was  most  enterprising  in  the  British  rail- 
way movement  of  from  forty  to  fifty  years  ago.  It  was  not  surprising  that  a  young 
man  of  ability  and  ambition  should  be  early  attracted  to  a  branch  of  business  which 
had  prizes  for  those  who  could  win  them.  Mr.  Wainwright,  born  on  the  30th  April, 
1840,  was  not  quite  eighteen  when  he  entered  the  service  in  January,  1858.  He 
applied  himself  diligently  to  the  tasks  assigned  him,  and  that  he  succeeded  in  master- 
ing them  in  all  their  details  was  shown  by  the  successive  steps  of  promotion  of 
which  he  was  deemed  worthy  by  his  superiors.  He  began  as  junior  clerk  in  the 
chief  accountant's  office,  but  in  due  time  rose  to  the  positions  of  senior  clerk,  secre- 
tary to  Assistant-General  Manager,  and  General  Manager  of  the  road  with  which  he 
was  connected.  That  line  was 'the  Manchester,  Sheffield  and  Lincolnshire  Railway, 
which  traverses  a  most  important  portion  of  Central  England.  In  1862,  Mr.  Wain- 
wright came  to  Canada,  and  obtained  a  position  on  the  Grand  Trunk.  For  a  year 
he  served  as  senior  clerk  in  the  Accountant's  office.  Then  he  was  appointed  Secre- 
tary to  the  Managing  Director,  and  in  that  capacity  he  continued  for  three  years. 
We  next  find  him  filling  the  office  of  Senior  Clerk  in  the  Managing  Director's  Depart- 
ment, and  taking  charge  of  the  car  mileage.  Thus  passed  six  years  more,  and  then 
Mr.  Wainwright  became  General  Passenger  Agent.  As  such  he  was  widely  known 
and  gave  general  satisfaction  as  well  to  his  colleagues  and  superiors  as  to  the  public 
that  had  deaHngs  with  him.  He  remained  in  that  position  for  upwards  of  eight 
years,  until  in  May,  1881,  he  received  the  appointment  of  Assistant-Manager,  the 
duties  of  which  he  still  so  ably  discharges.  Mr.  Wainwright  was  also  General-Man- 
ager of  the  North  Shore  Railway  from  April,  1883,  until  the  transfer  of  that  line  to 
the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway.  Mr.  Wainwright  is  highly  esteemed  in  private  life, 
being  as  agreeable  in  social  intercourse  as  he  is  assiduous  and  conscientious  in  the 
discharge  of  his  official  duties.

DAMASE  PARIZEAU.  ' 

"  La  Chambre  DE  Commerce  du  J)i.strict  dk  Montreal"  is  presided  over  by  a 
man  well-known  in  the  city.  The  first  of  his  name  came  to  Canada  with  the  regi- 
ment of  Carignan,  and  established  himself  after  it  was  disbanded.  One  of  its  members 
fought  at  Chateauguay,  and  received  until  he  died  the  pension  due  to  the  old 
patriotic  soldiers  of  1812-13.  Mr.  Parizeau  received  from  his  village  school  a  very 
model. ite  education.  When  eighteen  years  of  age  he  was  as  good  a  carpenter  as 
any  old  workman,  but  workmanship  did  not  suit  him.  He  then  went  with  the 
Messrs.  Henderson.  Tliree  years  after  he  was  their  head  clerk.  Experience  and 
savings  helping  him,  he  started  business  with  Mr.  Prefontaine,  which  business  he  now 
manages  alone. 

Mr.  Parizeau  did  not  spend  his  activity  on  trade  only.  Having  been  obliged  for 
his  health  to  leave  the  city,  he  chose  Boucherville  for  his  home.  There  he  spends  his 
time  in  the  enjoyment  of  a  fine  farm,  and  for  the  last  three  years  Mr.  Parizeau  has 
been  at  the  head  of  the  progressing  agriculturists  of  the  County  of  Chambly. 

A  few  years  ago,  La  Chambre  de  Commerce  was  created.  The  idea  was  new, 
modest  were  the  firstactions,  but  the  best  French  Canadian  financiers  wereat  the  head 
and  the  success  was  sure.  The  young  Board  of  Trade  had  great  results  in  many  diffi- 
culties, but  its  efforts  were  perceived  by  business  men  in  general.  Mr,  Parizeau  has 
been  one  of  the  most  active  founders  of  the  institution.  His  zeal  and  activity  gave  him 
a  good  mark  on  different  occasions,  when  two  years  ago  the  Board  elected  him  as 
President.  From  this  time  he  never  has  ceased  to  give  to  this  Board  the  attention 
which  he  gives  to  everything. 

By  the  Annual  Report  of  the  Listitution  it  seems  that  he  gave  his  special  atten- 
tion to  two  questions,  the  S^-^uth  Shore  Railway  and  the  improvement  of  the  Harbor. 
Under  his  inspiration  the  Board  has  made  many  appeals  to  the  Government  in  favor 
of  the  South  Shore  so  long  neglected,  and  the  time  is  not  far  off  when  we  shall  have 
a  beautiful  railroad  from  Montreal  to  Levis.  As  for  harbor  ameliorations  La 
Chamure  de  Commerce  seems  to  be  against  it ;  not  that  these  gentlemen  do  not  wish 
the  progress  of  the  city,  but  they  would  not  like  the  other  side  to  suffer  from  the  pro- 
gress of  this  side. 

Mr.  Parizeau  is  now  fifty  years  of  age.  He  has  been  put  up  as  an  Independent 
Liberal  in  the  great  contest  of  the  eighth  of  March  next,  to  run  opposition  to  the 
present  member,  Alderman  Rainville.     That  day  will  decide  who  wins.

ARCHIBALD   HALL,    M.I). 

The  subject  of  this  .sketch  was  one  of  tlie  best  known  pl-ysician.s  of  Montreal  in  his 
day.  He  wns  born  about  the  time  of  the  second  American  War  of  1812,  and  his 
name  runs  on  through  the  decad'is  to  1862.  He  was  at  one  lime  a  distinguished 
Professor  in  McGill  Medical  Sciiool,  but  had  a  great  love  for  Zoology  and  its  atten- 
dant branches.  He  gained  the  silver  medal  of  the  Historical  Society  of  Montreal  f&lt;;r 
his  Kssay  on  "  The  Zoology  of  the  District  of  Mcjntreal."  For  a  longtime  he  edited 
The  British  American  Journal  of  Medical  and  Physical  Science  which  he  founded 
in  i8.)5.  He  also  wrote  "  Letters  on  Medical  Kducation,"  and  a  biograjihy  of  the 
late  Dr.  Holmes.  After  a  busy  life  he  died  some  years  ago  universally  lamented  by 
all  classes,  and  especially  by  his  brother  professors  of  McGill  and  the  then  medical 
students,  who  all  loved  Dr.  Hall. 

CHARLES  ANDRK  LEBLANC,  Q.C. 

Charles  Andre  Leblanc,  late  Sheriff  for  the  District  of  Montreal,  was  born  in 
Montreal  on  the  i8th  August,  1816.  Besides  the  office  of  Sheriff,  he  held  many 
positions  of  high  honor  during  his  long  and  eventful  life.  We  will  merely  mention 
the  principal.  In  June,  1867,  he  was  appointed  a  Queen's  Counsel,  and  in  Novem- 
ber, 1872,  was  elevated  to  the  post  which  he  held  at  his  death — that  of  Sheriff.  Vox 
twelve  years  he  was  a  member  of  the  Council  of  the  Bar,  which  in  1863  elected  him 
as  its  Batonnier.  Sheriff  Leblanc  was,  on  behalf  of  the  then  Government,  Director 
of  the  Northern  Colonization  Railway,  and  also  President  of  thf  Reformatory  Insti- 
tution, to  which,  in  conjunction  with  Mr.  Olivier  Berthelet,  he  gave  a  great  deal  of 
his  time.  He  also  was  for  two  years  the  Presiutrt  of  the  St.  Jean  Bapliste  Society, 
and  belonged  to  the  Council  of  Public  Instruction  for  the  Province  of  Quebec,  of 
which  he  was  an  active  member. 

If  we  turn  to  his  early  days  we  find  that  he  was  educated  at  the  Montreal  Col- 
lege in  College  street,  the  only  educational  institution  at  that  time,  and  which  was 
under  the  direction  of  the  Sulpicians,  the  Directors  during  his  time  being  successfully 
R.  R.  Messrs.  Quiblier  and  Bayle.  On  leaving  College  he  studied  Law  for  five 
years  under  Pierre  Moreau,  Q.C,  whc  took  him  as  a  partner  when  he  was  called  to 
the  Bar  in  1838.  The  late  Francis  Cassidy,  Esq.,  Q.C,  who  studied  Law  in  the 
firm  of  Moreau  &amp;  Leblanc,  became  the  latter's  partner,  and  remained  so  for  twenty- 
five  years.  In  1837,  '^s  ^  Fil  de  la  Libert e,  he  became  implicated  and  was  incar 
cerated  during  five  months  in  the  Montreal  Gaol, — that  gaol  which  as  Sheriff  he 
had  entire  jurisdiction  over.  Of  his  comrades  at  College  we  mention  the  names  of 
Sir  Geo.  E.  Cartier,  Judges  Berthelot,  Beaudry,  Mgr.  Bacon,  Bishop  of  Portland, 
Messrs.  Roiier  Roy,  de  Boucherville,  and  many  other  Canadian  celebrities.  He 
was  the  Grand  Marshal  of  the  St.  Jean  Baptiste  Society  for  the  long  period  of  eigh- 
teen years.  He  was  also  the  Attorney  of  the  Jacques  Cartier  Bank  from  its  com- 
mencement until  his  elevation  to  the  office  of  Sheriff.      He  was  one  of  the  Directors

of  the  London  and  Lancashire  Life  Insurance  Company,  and  a  churchwarden  of  the 
Parish  Churcli  of  Notre  Dame,  audit  is  a  remarkable  fact,  showing  the  high  estimation 
in  which  Mr.  Leblanc  was  held  by  the  gentlemen  of  the  Seminary,  that  lie  was  the  first 
advocate  that  ever  held  theap[)ointment  He  died  some  years  ago,  much  lamented, 
and  was  succeeded  by  the  Honorable  V.  J.  O.  Chauveau,  LL.I).,  who  also  died  not 
long  ago,  and  has  been  succeeded  by  our  present  Sheriff,  I  Ion.  Senator  Thibaudeau. 
We  will  describe  the  (Jourt  House  in  connection  with  the  Siieriff's  Oflicc.  The 
Court  House  was  built  in  i8co,  under  a  Provincial  Statute,  by  which  the  sum  of 
;^5;000  was  appropriated  for  its  erection.  The  ground  upon  which  it  stands  was^ 
formerly  the  property  of  the  Jesuits.  It  contains  the  Court  Hall,  Court  of  Quarter 
Sessions,  Prothonotary's  Office,  oftices  of  Clerk  of  the  Crown,  Judges'  Chambers, 
Grand  Jury  Room,  Petty  Jury  Room,  the  Magistrates'  Room,  Law  Library  and 
Advocates'  Library,  and  Superior  and  Circuit  Court  Rooms,  etc.  (rrcat  alterations 
arc  now  being  made  in  its  structure.  A  third  storey  has  been  added,  a  Rotund  i  for 
the  Library,  and  very  many  essential  improvements,  and  which  will  render  it  the  finest 
Court  House  in  the  Dominion. 

THOMAS  M.    TAYLOR. 

The  Taylors  have  long  been  connected  with  Montreal  l)Oth  as  business  men  and  well, 
known  citizens.  One  of  them  died  a  few  days  ago.  The  subject  of  this  sketch  was, 
perhaps,  the  most  important.  They  were  for  years  connected  with  various  Insurance 
Companies,  Marine,  Life  and  Fire,  and  did  an  immense  business.  Mr.  Taylor, 
November,  1891,  writing  from  London,  ICngland,  to  the  Author  of  these  sketches, 
says  ;  "  There  might  be  some  justification  on  the  score  of  my  being  now  one  of  the 
older  men  of  Montreal."  He  has  had  a  rather  public  life  for  many  years.  He  is  now 
the  oldest  living  Governor  of  the  Montreal  General  Hospital,  by  api)ointment,  and 
always  had  a  great  deal  to  do  with  the  Home  for  Friendless  Women.  Perhaps  no 
man  like  Mr.  Taylor  can  say  that  he  has  lived  in  the  same  house  for  upwards  of  forty 
years.  He  is  still  active  and  energetic,  and  may  be  spared  for  years  yet  in  his  labor 
of  love  and  good  deeds  to  the  unfortunate.  His  sons  are  in  honorable  positions. 
One  son  is  a  Captain  in  the  British  Army,  the  other  is  well  known  as  a  Barrister  of 
Montreal,  and  one  of  the  rising  young  lawyers  of  the  Bar  of  the  Province  of  Quebec. 

NAHUM  MOWER. 

He  was  a  native  of  Worcester,  Mass.,  U.S.A.,  and  a  printer  by  trade.  In  1807,  he 
began  the  publication  of  a  newspaper  called  the  Canadian  Courant,  perhaps  the  first 
purely  English  paper  published  in  Canada.  The  two  Gazettes  of  Quebec  and  Mon-

Perkins,  who  had  two  sons.  The  eldest  was  a  lawyer  of  this  city,  and  died  some  ycais 
ago ;  the  other  is  in  the  Agency  business.

MLLE.  MANCE  AND  HOTEL  DIEU. 

In  May,  1642,  the  little  company  of  French  adventurers  arrived  at  Hochelaga  and 
commenced  Montreal  at  a  place  to  which  they  gave  the  name  of  "Pointe  a  Callieres." 
She  whjse  name  stands  at  the  head  of  this  sketch  was  one  of  them  with  "  quatre 
oil  cinq  filles  amenees  pour  aider  Mile.  Mance,"  as  we  find  in  "  Annales  de  I'HOtel 
Dieu."  This  intrepid  lady  had  come  to  Canada  to  found  this  Institution.  For  years 
she  had  none  to  help  her  but  the  devoted  sisters  who  had  come  from  sunny  France 
to  an  unknown  land,  and  in  1658  she  went  back  to  France  to  procure  assistance. 
Mme.  de  UuUion,  the  widow  of  an  old  State  Minister,  gave  her  22,000  livres  to  found 
her  hospital  at  Montreal.  Many  others  rendered  her  much  assistance  in  means  and 
money,  so  that  she  returned  to  Montreal  with  quite  a  large  surp  for  the  hospital, 
but  belter  still  with  three  Sisters  of  St.  Joseph.  On  the  voyage  out,  and  in  those 
olden  days  the  time  occupied  was  not  days  but  weeks  and  sometimes  months,  a 
serious  pestilence  broke  out  among  the  troops  on  board,  and  the  good  Sisters  had 
then  an  opportunity  of  displaying  their  zeal  and  charity,  which  they  did  so  effectually 
in  ministering  to  the  helpless  soldiers  that  many  were  saved  and  the  disease 
stamped  out. 

In  November,  1669,  three  other  Sisters  arrived  from  France.  Mme.  de  Bresoles 
was  then  appointed  Superioress,  but  it  was  long  before  the  building  was  fit  and  com- 
fortable to  dwell  in.  Often  have  the  Sisters  in  the  winter  time  when  they  awoke  in 
the  morning  found  their  bsds  covered  with  snow,  yet  they  plodded  on  in  their  good 
work,  which  was  at  last  rewarded.  In  August,  1662,  Sister  Marie  Morin  entered  the 
Hotel  Dieu  as  a  novice  at  the  early  age  of  thirteen  and  a  half  years.  She  is  the  very 
first  Canadian  Sister  who  made  her  vows  in  Montreal.  Like  Anna  the  Prophetess  of 
Jerusalem's  Temple  of  old,  she  served  God  day  and  night  till  she  died  at  the 
advanced  age  of  eighty-two  years. 

In  1694,  the  hospital  was  burned.  It  was  again  burned  19th  June,  1721.  In 
November,  1824,  the  Sisters  re-entered  their  home,  but  again  for  the  third  time,  in 
1734,  the  building  was  burned  to  the  ground.  It  was  again  rebuilt,  and  at  the  time 
of  the  great  fire  of  the  Grey  Nunnery  of  1765  the  Hotel  Dieu  could  offer  an  asylum 
to  the  Sceurs  Grises.  In  1795,  it  was  determined  to  propagate  the  Roman  Catholic 
faith  in  the  newly-made  thirteen  States  of  America.  A  Mr.  Thayer,  once  a  Protes- 
tant Minister,  now  converted  to  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  was  the  founder  of  an 
association  for  this  purpose.  The  Revolution  in  France  at  the  close  of  the  last 
century  deprived  the  Hotel  Dieu  of  a  large  part  of  its  revenues,  but  in  1815  a  good 
priest.  Rev.  J.  B.  Thavenet,  went  to  France  to  try  and  collect  the  scattered  revenues 
unpaid  now  for  nearly  twenty  years.  He  succeeded,  and  all  the  Canadian  Institutions 
benefitted  by  his  pious  endeavors. 

In  1852,  the  Sisters  acquired  the  large  and  handsome  building  which  had  been 
a  Baptist  College,  and  gave  it  the  name  of  St.  Patrick's  Hospital. 

After  some  years,  they  purchased  the  large  tract  on  Fletcher's  Field  where  the

immense  buildings  of  the  Hotel  Dieu  are  now  built,  and  could  the  first  Sisters  only 
sec  the  result  of  their  p.-i*'-  nt  work  250  years  ago,  when  Ville  Marie — Mariopolis — or 
Montreal  was  founded  then,  by  these  intrepid  Frenchmen  and  Frenchwomen,  they 
could  hardly  believe  that  their  eyes  were  looking  on  the  buildings  of  as  grand  an 
Institution  as  is  found  on  the  Continent  of  America,  where  pain  and  sickness,  sorrow 
and  woe,  are  either  moderated  or  entirely  removed  by  as  skilful  a  body  of  Physicians 
and  patient  nursing  Sisters  as  found  anywhere. 

MARGUERITE  BOURGEOIS. 

This  celel)ratcd  lady  was  born  in  1620  in  the  town  of  Troyes,  France,  celebrated 
for  giving  name  to  Troy  weight.  It  is  one  of  the  principal  towns  of  that  department 
of  France  called  Champagne,  hence  the  well-known  wine  of  that  name.  She  early 
evinced  a  religious  lif^,  and  when  quite  a  young  girl  joined  a,n  institution  of  young 
persons,  who  witiiout  contracting  any  conscientious  engagement,  nevertheless  gave 
themselves  up  to  devotion  by  the  good  works  which  it  did  in  common.  She  early 
felt  herself  called  to  found  a  new  institution  wliich  would  devote  itself  to  the  educa- 
tion of  the  young.  When  DeMaisonneuve,  in  1653,  returned  to  France,  he  passed 
some  time  in  the  town  of  Troyes,  Marguerite  then  dedicated  herself  to  God  and 
determined  to  go  with  him  to  Montreal,  quitting  her  native  country  with  a  courage 
rarely  seen,  and  a  confidence  in  the  Divine  guidance  of  the  Spirit  of  God.  After 
many  trials  she  arrived  in  Montreal  on  the  i6lh  November,  1653,  and  there  displayed 
the  ardor  of  a  heroine  and  the  cliarity  of  an  apostle.  Montreal  tlien  consisted  of 
about  fifty  houses,  and  there  were  not  many  children  to  form  a  school.  La  Soeur 
Bourgeois'  first  scholars  were  Jeanne  Loysel,  who  was  four  and  a-half  years  old,  and 
Jean  Desroches.  These  children  were  among  the  first  if  not  the  first  born  in  Mon- 
treal in  1649. 

In  1657,  she  had  a  school  now,  but  it  was  in  a  stable,  so  poor  was  the  colony. 
In  1658  she  returned  to  France  to  collect  money  and  other  requirements,  and  from 
Troyes  she  brought  four  young  women,  and  when  she  arrived  in  Montreal  with  them 
she  founded  the  Congregation  of  Notre  Dame.  In  1666,  their  establishment  having 
prospered,  they  opened  a  school  for  little  girls  of  the  poorer  class.  These  good  and 
pious  ladies  not  only  worked  incessantly  among  the  people,  but  with  their  own  hands 
helped  the  masons  in  the  building  of  the  Bonsecours  Church,  which  is  now  the 
oldest  edifice  of  worship  in  Montreal.  She  employed  the  last  years  of  her  eventful 
life  in  making  her  establishment  rest  on  a  firm  and  legal  foundation.  In  [671,  she 
had  obtained  Letters  Patent  from  Louis  XIV,  and  in  successive  years  the  property  of 
the  Sisters  was  secured  from  all  annoyance. 

On  the  ist  December,  1683,  the  whole  establishment  was  burned  to  the  ground. 
Trusting  in  God,  the  heroic  Sister  began  to  rebuild  "  with  only  forty  sols,"  but  dona- 
tions soon  poured  in  to  help  her,  and  above  all  she  received  the  aid  and  help  of 
Mile.  Jeanne  LeBer,  a  rich  girl  of  Canada  of  seventeen  years  old,  who  with  the  consent 
of  her  father  determined  to  abandon  the  world  and  live  the  life  of  a  recluse.  This 
example  brought  others.

In  1698,  the  third  Superioress  was  la  Scciir  MaigiiL-ritc  LcMoyne.  llcr  valiant 
brollicrs  were  lUcrviiic,  IJieiiville,  Ohateaiigiuiy,  etc. 

In  176.S,  a  second  fire  oMiged  the  Sisters  to  seek  the  hospitality  of  the  Hotel 
Dicii.  The  convent  was  reconstructed  to  receive  the  Sisters  once  more.  In  1S44, 
it  was  thoroughly  reconstructed  and  is  now  one  of  the  f-iiest  educational  establish- 
ments in  Canada,  though  situated  in  the  very  heart  of  the  city. 

J.  CRANKSIIAW. 

"TiiK  profession  of  the  Law  is  one,  the  importance  of  whi(  ii  cannot  be  over-rated, 
and  in  this  work,  where  the  commercial  and  industrial  enterprises  of  the  Ciiy  of  Mon- 
treal are  described,  the  Local  Bar  comes  within  its  scope.  Among  members  of  this 
profession,  Mr.  J.  Cranksiiaw  deserves  a  passing  tribute,  'i'iiis  i)opular  barrister 
began  practice  in  1883,  which  has  steadily  increased,  having  during  the  intervening 
period  drawn  about  him  a  very  extensive  and  intluential  clientele.  Mr.  Crankshaw 
has  always  taken  a  high  stand  in  his  profession,  and  has  had  many  years'  experience 
in  this  country  as  well  as  in  Knghind,  where  for  many  years  he  was  manager  for  a 
Law  firm  in  Manchester,  thus  fitting  him  for  conducting  all  the  details  in  Law. 
During  his  professional  career  in  this  city  he  has  successfully  handled  many  difficult 
cases,  and  his  advice  on  all  legal  matters  is  widely  recognized  as  an  authority,  clients 
visiting  him  from  various  parts  of  the  Province.  He  has  at  all  limes  identified  himself 
with  the  best  interests  of  the  city,  and  has  for  many  years  been  a  Commissioner  for 
Ontario.  He  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  of  Quebec  in  1883,  and  has  ever  since  kept 
up  with  the  times." 

REV.  ROBERT  LINDSAY,  M.A., 

Was  born   in    London,  England.     Studied  at  Lennoxville  College,  and  graduated 

thence  with   much  success.     He  was   ordained   Deacon  in  1850  by  the  Bishoi)  of 

Quebec,  and  next  year  Priest  by  the  new  Metropolitan,  the  late  Bishop  Fulford,  1851. 

Mr.  Lindsay  had  only  two  parishes,  that  of  Brome  as  Licumbent  for  the  long  period 

of  twenty-five  years,  and  Rector  of  St.  Thomas,  Montreal,  till  he  died  last  year,  after 

an  incumbency  of  over  sixteen  years.     He  will  ever  be  remembered  in  comiection 

with  the  charities  and  works  of  mercy  in  this  city.     He  devoted  a  great  deal  of  his 

time  to  these  things,  and  no  Committee  of  any  general  character  was  ever  made  up 

without  him.     He  was  Rural  Dean  for  years,  and  performed  the  duties  of  his  ofiice 

thoroughly  and  well.     Elected  almost  continually  both  on  the  Executive  Committee 

of  the  Diocese,  and  as  a  Delegate  to  the  Provincial  Triennial  Synod  be  always  was 

ready  to  advocate  everything  needful  to  the  advancement  of  the  Church  generally, 

to  which  he  belonged.     He  was  cut  off  in  the  midst  of  many  schemes  of  future 

usefulness,  and  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  his  mantle  will  fall  on  some  other  as  able 

shoulders.

much,  if  not  more,  power  with  the  Government  than  any  other  man  in  Canada.  From

offices  in  Toronto  and  Quebec,  where  he  carried  out  his  Government  contracts.     In

Son  of  Rollo  Ciimphcll,  was  born  in  Montreal  on  the  5tli  of  Novcnil)cr.  1S37.  In 
1 85 1,  when  fourteen  years  of  age,  he  issued  tlic  first  ninnl)er  ofa  inontlily  temperance 
publication  called  the  Life  lioat,  which  for  the  year  cf)iitinued  uiuler  his  care,  when 
it  was  transferred  to  a  firm  in  Montreal,  who  continued  its  publication  for  several 
years.  Afterwards  he  became  a  pupil  of  the  late  Dr.  James  Crawford,  and  a  student 
of  McCIill  IHiiversity.  He  graduated  in  i860.  He  shortly  afler  proceeded  to 
Europe  and  spent  a  considerable  time  in  London,  Dublin,  I'ldinburgh,  and  (ilasgow. 
In  June,  1861,  he  passed  most  successfully  an  examination  before  the  Royal  College 
of  Physicians  of  London.  About  the  same  time  he  was  also  elected  a  member  of  the 
Royal  Medical  Society  of  lulinburgh  and  of  the  Microscopic  Club.  In  October, 
1861,  he  married  Miss  Rodger,  of  (Ireenock,  Scotland,  and  in  November  of  same 
year  returned  to  (!anada  and  began  the  practice  of  his  profession.  The  late  Dr. 
Hall,  who  was  i)ublishing  the  Jhitish  Anurican  /oiirtui/,  at  once  offered  hun  the 
editorship  of  "The  Hospital  Report  Dei)artment,"  which  he  accepted,  ami  till  1864, 
when  it  ceased  publication,  he  continued  to  edit  this  dejjartment.  Tiie  i)rofession 
at  this  time  felt  much  the  loss  of  this  journal,  and  Messrs.  Dawson  IJros.  were  induced 
to  commence  the  publication  of  the  Canada  i\f('d'tcal Journal,  when  Dr.  Campbell 
joined  Dr.  l-'enwick  in  its  editorial  management,  and  he  continued  in  this  position 
till  1872,  when  Dr.  Campbell  having  joined  the  Medical  Faculty  of  Bishop's  College, 
Dr.  Fenwick  declined  to  longer  continue  associated  with  him.  The  result  was  the 
stoppage  of  the  Canada  Medical JonrnaL  Dr.  Fenwick  having  determined  upon 
issuing  a  medical  journal  under  his  own  control,  Dr.  Campbell  at  once  determined 
to  contest  the  field,  and  immediately  issued  the  Canada  Medical  Record,  which  is 
still  published  under  his  sole  editorial  management,  and  of  which  he  is  proprietor. 
Besides  his  editorial  duties,  Dr.  Campbell  has  contributed  about  thirty  papers  upon 
various  medical  subjects  to  medical  journals  during  the  past  twelve  years.  In  1872, 
Dr.  Campbell  joined  with  Drs.  David,  Smallwood,  Hingston  and  Trenholme,  in 
organizing  the  present  Medical  Faculty  of  Bishop's  College.  He  was  appointed  Pro- 
fessor of  Physiology,  and  elected  by  the  Faculty  their  Registrar.  He  joined  the 
Volunteers  in  1854,  and  in  i860,  on  his  graduation,  was  appointed  Assistant  Surgeon 
of  the  First  Battalion  Volunteer  Rifles  of  Canada  (now  the  First  Battalion  or  Prince 
of  Wales  Rifles).  In  this  caj)acity  he  served  with  his  Regiment  on  the  Eastern 
frontier  (Hemmingford  and  Durham)  during  the  Fenian  raid  of  1866.  In  the  fall  of 
that  year  he  was  promoted  to  the  Surgeoncy  of  the  Regiment,  and  again  during  the 
brief  Fenian  raid  of  1870  served  with  his  Regiment  on  the  Eastern  frontier  at  Pigeoa 
Hill,  St.  Armands  and  St.  Johns.  He  is  still  actively  engaged  in  the  duties  of  his- 
profession,  and  one  of  the  oldest  as  »rell  as  the  most  prominent  physicians  of  our

MICHKI.  I.KFEBVRE,  J. P. 


GAZEITEER   OF    MONTREAL.  4^9 

MICHEL    LEFEBVRE,  J.P. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  at  La  Riviere  du  Loup  en  Haut,  Louisviile&gt; 
Maskinonge  County,  Quebec,  on  the  28th  June,  1827.  His  father,  of  the  same  name, 
was  a  farmer  of  that  place.  He  left  his  native  place  in  search  of  fortune  in  1840, 
and  in  that  year  arrived  in  Montreal  when  only  thirteen  years  of  age,  and  then,  like 
many  men  both  in  Montreal  and  other  Canadian  cities,  had  no  money.  He  was 
employed  for  the  next  nine  years  in  two  situations  only,  and  quite  a  young  man,  in 
1849  commenced  business  on  his  own  account,  manufacturing  extensively  till  1867, 
syrups,  beer,  vermicelli,  macaroni,  etc.,  and  receiving  first-class  prizes  for  each  of 
these  articles  at  the  Montreal  Industrial  Exhibition,  1865.  On  account  of  bad  health, 
in  1867  he  made  a  tour  of  Europe,  and  on  his  return  gave  up  business,  and  bought 
the  beautiful  seigniory,  known  by  the  name  of  "de  Lanaudiere,"  in  St.  Ursule,  where 
he  quietly  resided  enjoying  his  well-earned  fortune.  In  1873,  he  returned  to  Mon- 
treal. In  1874,  he  established  Vinegar  Works,  one  of  the  largest  manufactories  of 
that  commodity  in  the  Dominion,  and  capable  of  making  200,000  gallons  per  annum. 
He  is  also  a  great  manufacturer  of  all  kinds  of  syrups  and  jams.  Perhaps  no  man  in 
Canada  goes  more  extensively  into  these  things  than  Mr.  Lefebvre,  and  his  conserves, 
vinegar  and  syrups  are  found  all  over  the  Dominion.  Mr.  Lefebvre's  travels  and 
reminiscences  of  the  Holy  Land  would  fill  a  large  volume.  He  is  one  of  those  men 
who  travel  with  their  eyes  and  wits  about  them,  and  who  can  give  a  good  account 
of  what  they  have  seen  and  heard. 

Mr.  Lefebvre  was  Mayor  of  Cote  St.  Louis  Municipality,  having  been  three 
times  elected  to  that  position,  a  Justice  of  the  Peace  for  the  District  of  Montreal, 
and  Director  for  C()le  St.  Louis  of  the  Northern  Colonization  Railway,  and  has  lent 
his  influence  to  many  works  for  the  future  development  of  thr.  City  of  Montreal. 
Let  me  give  from  a  recent  publication  a  description  of  Mr.  Lefebvre's  establish- 
ment : 

"  Their  present  premises  on  Papineau  Road  prove  that  the  enterprise  of  the 
partners  has  received  a  due  measure  of  reward.  An  idea  of  the  size  of  these  build- 
ings may  be  gained  when  it  is  said  that  the  main  building  is  two  hundred  feet  long 
and  sixty  feet  deep,  built  of  solid  brick,  and  four  stories  high.  This  structure  is 
occupied  by  the  offices,  warehouse  and  jam  factory.  The  other  buildings  are  as 
follows:  vinegar  works  two  stories  high,  50  x  80  feet;  pickle  works  of  the  same  size; 
salt  house  120  x  60  feet.  Besides  these  erections  there  are  shops  for  the  coopers, 
blacksmiths  and  carpenters,  as  well  as  dwellings  for  the  foreman  and  watchman,  etc. 
As  may  be  judged  from  the  above  the  amount  of  business  done  is  considerable,  the

hundred  and  fifty  additional  hands  in  the  summer  season.  Messrs.  Michel  Lefebvre

These  goods  are  known  as  the  ''Lion  *  L'  Brand,"  and  that  they  are  of  the  best 
quality  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  they  have  received  gold,  silver  and  bronze  medals,.

JOSEPH  PAPINEAU,  HON.  L.  J.  PAPINEAU,  AND  LOUIS  JOS.  A.   PAPINEAU. 

L.  J.  Papineau  may  well  be  called  "The  O'Connell  of  Lower  Canada."  His 
(political  career,  generally,  was  contemporaneous  with  the  greatest  Irish  liberator. 
He  played,  perhaps,  the  most  important  part  in  the  history  of  Lower  Canada,  during 
his  long  career.  Tims  nearly  sixty  years  ago  he  held  a  high  and  important  position, 
and  as  Speaker  could,  with  the  oratory  of  his  tongue,  sway  the  House  before  him. 
No  man  of  any  nationality  was  as  eloquent  as  he — his  genius  and  oratory  were 
unsurpassed,  and  the  name  of  Louis  Joseph  Papineau  will  ever  remain  in  Canadian 
Parliamentary  History  as  the  "  Demosthenes  of  Canada." 

Mr.  Papineau  was  born  in  Montreal,  7th  October,  1786.  His  father,  the  well 
known  Notary  of  his  day  and  a  very  distinguished  man,  was  called  Josepli  Papineau- 
Joseph  Papineau  was  one  of  the  principal  promoters  of  the  Constitution  of  1791, 
•and  was  elected  to  the  first  Parliament  that  Canada  enjoyed  after  the  Military  and 
Arbitrary  Governments  that  followed  the  Cession,  and  remained  with  Bedard,  the 
leader  for  many  years  in  the  Legislative  Assembly  of  Quebec,  wherein  he  displayed 
much  tact  and  ability,  great  eloquence,  and,  more  than  anything  else,  an  unfaltering 
attachment  to  the  Crown,  as  well  as  to  the  liberties  of  Parliament  and  of  the  country. 
He  retired  fro-n  the  Leadership  of  the  Liberal  Party  in  Parliament  when  his  illus- 
trious son  replaced  him  there.  In  the  summer  of  1838,  they  met  for  the  last  time  at 
Saratoga,  to  bid  each  other  a  final  adieu — the  son  starting  for  France,  the  father 
returning  heart-broken  to  his  native  land,  where  he  died  July  8th,  1841,  aged  ninety. 

The  Hon.  L.  J.  Papineau  was  educated  chiefly  at  the  Seminary  of  Quebec,  and 
having  studied  the  course  of  Law  prescribed  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  of  Lower  Canada 
in  181 1.  So  brilliant  were  his  prospects  and  his  talents  even  before  this,  that  in 
1809,  and  when  still  a  student,  he  was  elected  to  the  Assembly  for  the  County  of 
Kent,  now  Chambly,  and  in  18 15  the  high  honor  was  given  him  of  being  appointed 
Speaker.  This  office  Mr.  Papineau  held  with  only  two  years'  intermission — during  his 
mission  to  England  as  delegate  of  the  Assembly  in  T822-23 — for  the  long  period  of 
twenty  years,  or  until  the  year  1837,  the  year  of  the  unfortunate  troubles,  when  he 
threw  himself  heartily  into  what  he  considered  the  right  and  lawful  course  of  action 
— to  gain  that  which  the  present  generation  enjoys,  through  his  and  his  confreres 
endeavors  then — Responsible  Government  and  all  the  liberties  of  the  British  Consti- 
tution which  had  so  long  been  denied  in  practice.  In  1820,  when  Lord  Dalhousie 
became  Governor,  he  appointed  Mr.  Papineau  to  a  seat  in  the  Executive  Council, 


GAZKTTKER  OF  MONTREAL.  411 

but  this  post  was  soon  declined  by  him,  when  he  found  it  a  vain  honor  without  tlie 
influence  tliis  Council  should  have  had  on  the  determinations  of  the  Governor.  In 
1822,  the  Union  of  Upper  and  Lower  Canada  having  been  upon  the  ta/&gt;is,  and  the 
subject  being  distasteful  to  many,  Messrs.  Papineau  and  John  Neilson  went  lo  Eng- 
land, and  were  successful  in  getting  the  Union  postponed  for  the  next  two  years. 
In  1827,  unfortunate  difficulties  arose  between  the  Governor  and  Mr.  Papineau,  and 
to  sucii  a  height  did  they  reach  that  the  former  refused  to  acknowledge  Mr.  Papineau 
as  Speaker,  though  duly  elected  to  that  liigii  office  by  a  large  majority  of  the  Assembly. 
The  Assembly  triumphed,  and  Lord  Dalhousie  had  to  resign  his  office  as  Governor, 
after  having  in  a  pet  dissolved  the  Assembly.  He  was  succeeded  by  Sir  James 
Kempt,  who,  after  the  next  elections,  duly  accepted  Mr.  Papineau  as  the  Si)eaker 
again  ajipointed,  and  giving  him  perhaps  one  of  the  greatest  triumphs  ever  achieved 
by  any  person  in  the  political  arena  of  any  country.  Political  troubles  grew  worse 
as  years  rolled  on,  and  in  1836  they  culminated  in  the  events  of  that  and  the  next 
two  years,  whicii  for  the  time  threw  Canada  into  a  state  of  turmoil  and  anxiety,  now 
happily  all  passed  away,  leaving  only  the  fruits  so  bravely  and  indomitably  sought 
for,  constitutional  government  and  unbiased  representation. 

The  so-called  leaders  of  the  disturbances  having  had  rewards  of  apprehension 
placed  on  their  heads,  Mr.  Papineau  as  one  fled  to  the  United  States,  where  he 
resided  from  1837  to  1839.  He  then  removed  to  Paris,  France,  where  he  lived  till 
1847,  when  the  issue  of  the  amnesty  proclamation  enabled  him  to  return  to  his 
native  land.  His  aged  father  had  passed  away  when  liis  son  was  in  exile  in  1840, 
and  many  of  the  old  familiar  faces  had,  too,  gone  to  that  "  country  from  whose 
bourne  no  traveller  returns." 

But  Mr.  Pajjineau,  ever  energetic  and  possessed  of  an  indomitable  courage, 
again  entered  Parliament,  and  was  continued  there  until  1854.  At  this  period,  how- 
ever, for  various  reasons  he  retired  into  private  life,  and  for  the  next  seventeen  years 
enjoyed  the  calm  of  a  green  and  sturdy  old  age,  the  love  of  books  and  horticultuie, 
and  the  personal  esteem  of  those  who  best  knew  his  character.  His  death  took  place 
on  Saturday,  the  23rd  September,  187 1,  at  his  residence  ai  Monte-Bello,  and  at  the 
patriarchal  age  ot"  eighty-five. 

Louis  Joseph  Amedee  Papineau,  grandson  of  Joseph  Papineau,  and  eldest  and 
only  surviving  son  of  Hon,  Louis  Joseph  Papineau,  was  born  at  Montreal,  on  26th 
July,  1819.  A  pupil  of  the  Waller  and  Ksson  Schools,  and  of  i'Abbe  Duchene,  he 
entered  the  College  of  Montreal  in  1829,  and  completed  his  course  of  Philosophy  at 
the  College  of  St.  Hyacinthe.  At  the  latter,  he  wrote  the  legend  of  '•  Chateau  Bigot," 
and  published  it  in  L'Echo  du  Pays  of  St.  Charles  :  so  often  amplified  since  by  other 
writers.  In  1835,  he  began  the  study  of  Law  with  a  notary,  Trudeau,  ^nd  an  advocate, 
Philippe  Bruneau — both  relatives.  Organized  several  Societh  Liitiraire  in  and  out 
of  the  Colleges.  But  the  Political  Crisis  soon  absorbed  all  his  attention.  He  wrote 
frequently  in  La  Minerve  and  The  Vindicator.  He  followed  his  father  in  that 
momentous  campaign  of  protestation  and  revendication  all  over  the  Province,  from

May  to  November,  1837.  Full  of  the  study  of  the  American  Revolution,  in  Jeffer- 
son, Paine,  Randolph,  Marshall,  and  Patrick  Henry,  he  remembered  what  the  Sons  of 
Liberty  had  done  in  New  England,  and  he  founded,  with  his  friends,  Lcs  I^ils  de  la 
Liberie.  After  the  defeat  of  the  Patriots,  he  took  refuge  in  the  United  States, 
after  ])assing  the  ordeal  of  the  guards  at  Stanstead  Plain,  whom  he  skilfully  deceived 
after  an  imprisonment  of  a  few  hours.  They  took  him  for  an  idiot  emigrant,  after 
he  had  allayed  their  suspicions  that  he  was  a  rebel  messenger.  He  joined  his  father 
two  weeks  later,  at  the  first  Convention  at  Middlebury,  and  returned  with  him  to 
Saratoga,  where  he  was  for  three  years  studying  Law  as  an  adopted  son  of  the 
Chancellor  and  of  the  Supreme  Judge  Cowen  of  the  State.  A  special  and  gratui- 
tous Act  of  the  Legislature  of  New  York  admitted  him  to  v.ie  profession,  although 
he  was  an  alien.  Introduced  by  his  patrons  to  one  of  the  first  law  firms  of  the  City 
of  New  York,  Tillon  &amp;  Cutting,  he  practised  there  for  a  couple  of  years,  and  then 
visited  his  father  and  exiled  family  in  Paris.  In  1843,  icturned  to  Canada.  Was 
appointed  Census  Commissioner  for  the  City  and  Island  of  Montreal.  On  the  4th 
of  July,  1844,  01^  t'le  death  of  Mr.  Morrogh,  he  was  appointed  Prothonotary  of  the 
Queen's  Bench,  witii  Messrs.  Monk  &amp;  Coffin  ;  and  of  the  Superior  Court,  when  it 
took  that  title  for  the  civil  side  of  the  Queen's  Bench,  He  remained  Prothonotary 
for  thirty-two  years,  and  then  resigned  to  travel  in  Europe  with  his  family.  Pie  did 
not  return  until  1881,  when  lie  settled  at  the  Manor  of  Monte-Bello,  inherited  in 
187 1  from  his  father.  He  there  cultivates  the  fine  arts,  books,  and  garden,  and 
occasionally  fires  a  shot  at  tyranny  and  abuses  when  tiie  trumpet  sounds  the  alarm. 
His  motto  and  watchword  is — Liberlas,  Patria,  Htimanitas,  and  he  ardently  hopes 
for  the  independence  and  glory  of  his  native  land  in  a  near  future,  and,  like  Saint 
Simeon  of  old,  if  accomplished,  then  lie  shall  die  in  jDcace. 

REV.  CANON  ELLEGOOD,  M.A, 

The  subject  of  this  short  sketch  is  one  of  the  oldest  Episcopal  Clergy  in  Montreal. 
Jacob  Ellegood  was  born  in  New  Brunswick  and  educated  at  the  well-known  College 
of  that  Province,  "  King's  College,"  situated  in  Frcdericton,  one  of  the  Capitals  of 
the  country.  Studied  and  was  ordained  Deacon  as  far  back  as  1848,  and  next  year 
Priest  by  the  Bishop  of  Quebec.  Came  to  Montreal,  and  was  appointed  Assistant 
Curate  in  Ciirist  Church  Cathedral  in  1848.  Afterwards  received  the  Incumbency  of 
St.  Anne's  Church,  Griffintown,  since  called  St.  Stephen's,  and  now  under  the  charge 
of  the  Ven.  Archdeacon  Evans,  M.A.  After  many  years  in  charge,  he  built  St.  James 
the  Apostle,  St.  Catherine  street,  where  ever  since  he  has  been  the  genial  and  beloved 
Rector.  He  was  installed  Canon  of  the  Cathedral  in  1872,  and  has  travelled  exten- 
sively in  Europe  and  Palestine.  He  married  a  sister  of  the  late  Canon  Duvernet. 
She  died  many  years  ago.  His  sister  is  married  to  the  well-known  John  Crawford  of 
Verdun.

DR.  DESJARDINS 

Was  born  at  Terrebonne,  loth  September,  1837.  He  studied  at  Masson  College  and 
finished  at  Nicolet.  He  married  Mile  Z.  Pare,  one  of  the  daughters  of  the  late  H. 
Pare,  Esq.  Having  practiced  Medicine  for  seven  years  in  Montreal,  he  then  went  to 
Europe  to  study  Ophthalmy  or  disease  of  the  eyes,  and  on  his  return  made  a  special 
treatment  of  eye  troubles  in  the  Hotel  Dieu.  He  went  a  second  time  to  Europe  to 
complete  his  studies,  and  whilst  in  London  was  admitted  a  member  of  the  International 
Congress  of  Ophthalmy.  In  1873,  he  returned  to  Montreal  and  founded  ihe  Oph- 
thalmic Institution.  He  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the  "  Societe  M6dicale  de  Mont- 
real," and  also  of  the  journal  L'  Union  Midicale.  But  it  is  in  the  charitable  work 
of  the  Doctor  that  Montreal  prides  herself.  He  has  by  his  liberality  and  Christian 
sympathetic  charity  endeared  himself  to  thousands  who  have  benefitted  by  his 
wonderful  cures  "  without  money  and  without  price."  Yes,  no  man  deserves  more 
of  his  fellow  citizens,  be  he  who  he  may,  than  he  who  wholly  devotes  his  time,  his 
talents,  his  life  and  means  to  the  amelioration  of  poor  miserable  humanity.  To  him 
shall  be  ascribed  the  words,  "  Well  done." 

HENRY    H.    MILES,    LL.D.,  D.CL. 

Henry  Hopper  Miles,  late  S.  :retary  of  the  Department  of  Public  Instruction  for 
the  Province  of  Quebec,  and  a  writer  of  text-books  for  public  schools,  is  well  known 
throughout  the  Dominion  for  his  invaluable  labors  in  connection  with  the  cause  of 
education.  He  was  born  in  London,  Isngland,  on  the  i8th  October,  1818,  his  father 
being  Lieutenant  Richard  Miles,  of  the  Royal  Navy,  who  died  at  Deal,  Kent,  in  1822. 
The  family  belonged  originally  to  the  West  of  England,  and  a  branch  went  over  to 
Kent,  in  which  county  it  is  now  not  uncommon  to  meet  with  persons  of  the  name  of 
Miles.  His  mother  was  Mary  Hopper,  which  name  was  originally  Hooper,  one  of 
her  ancestors.  Bishop  Hooper,  having  been  burnt  at  the  stake,  after  which  the  numer- 
ous immediate  descendants  of  the  martyr,  finding  their  family  ..--me  obnoxious  to 
many  of  their  neighbors  and  fellow  citizens,  changed  it  to  Hopper,  and  went  away 
to  settle  in  the  other  counties. 

Our  subject  was  educated  in  part  at  the  Grammar  School  of  Exeter,  Devonshire, 
and  finished  in  Edinburgh  and  Aberdeen,  Scotland,  including  medical  studies  ;  but 
finding  the  profession  distasteful,  he  never  took  up  the  practice  of  it. 

In  1845,  by  invitation,  he  came  to  Lennoxville  to  fill  the  Chair  of  Mathematics 
and  Natural  Philosophy  in  the  University  of  Bishop's  College,  and  also  the  office  of 
vice-principal  of  that  institution,  a  post  which  he  held  for  twenty-one  years.  During 
this  period  he  took  great  interest  in  educational  matters  generally  in  the  province, 
and  did  no  inconsiderable  amount  of  literary  work  outside  of  his  special  labors  at 
Lennoxville. 

In  1862,  he  was  sent  to  England  in  company  with  Sir  William  Logan,  to 
represent  the  Eastern  Townships  of  Quebec  in  the  International  Exhibition,  held  in 


414  GAZETTEER   OF    MONTREAL. 

London.  In  185S,  he  took  part,  by  invitation,  in  a  course  of  public  lectures  given 
by  various  lecturers  in  the  Mechanics'  Hall,  Montreal,  when  he  delivered  two  on  the 
suDJect  of  "  The  Ventilation  of  Dwelling  Houses  and  Schools,"  which  were  published 
in  pamphlet  form  and  circulated  gratuitously  at  the  expense  of  members  of  the 
Merchants'  Exchange. 

In  1866,  he  resigned  his  office  in  Bishop's  College,  the  corporation  of  which,  in 
consideration  of  his  lengthened  and  valued  services,  generously  continued  to  him  the 
payment  of  his  customary  salary  for  the  space  of  a  year  subsequent  to  his 
retirement. 

When  the  Confederation  of  the  Provinces  was  completed,  he  was  offered,  and 
accepted,  the  office  already  mentioned,  and  removed  to  the  City  of  Quebec. 

Dr.  Miles,  in  the  year  1863,  had  the  degree  of  LL.D.  conferred  on  him  by  the 
University  of  Aberdeen,  and  tiie  same  by  the  University  of  McGill,  Montreal,  in  1866. 
He  is  also  a  D.C.L.  of  Bishop's  College,  1866.  In  1867,  he  was  elected  President  of 
the  Provincial  Association  of  Protestant  Teachers,  and  in  the  same  year  when  the 
Geograi)hical  Society  of  Quebec  was  founded  through  the  efforts  of  the  late  Hon. 
P.  Forlin,  M.P.,  aided  by  Dr.  Miles  and  otiier  warm  friends  of  such  enterprises,  he 
was  chosen  one  of  its  vice-presidents. 

Dr.  Miles  was  for  the  year  1880  jiresidentof  the  latter  society.  In  other  lines  of 
literary  labor  his  hand  has  often  made  its  mark.  He  has  written  a  good  deal  for 
educational  and  literary  magazines,  and  has  done  important  work  in  preparing  text- 
books for  use  in  the  public  schools  of  the  Dominion.  He  is  the  author  of  a  "  Child's 
History  of  Canada,"  the  "  School  History  of  Canada,"  and  of  a  larger  work, 
entitled  :  "  ('anada  Under  the  French  Regime,"  some  of  these  works  having 
passed  through  two  or  three  editions.  His  work  on  the  French  Regime  in  Canada 
is,  it  is  understood,  to  have  a  sequel,  entitled:  "Canada  Under  British  Rule, 
1760-1 867."  Among  his  minor  productions,  mention  may  also  be  made  of  "  Canada 
East  at  the  International  Exhibition,"  and  "  The  Eastern  Townships  of  Canada," 
both  published  in  London  in  1862,  as  well  as  several  historical  articles  printed  in  the 
volumes  of"  Transactions  of  the  Quebec  Literary  and  Historical  Society."  A  some- 
what remarkable  article  upon  a  controverted  question  relating  to  the  earlier  days  of 
the  great  Admiral  Nelson,  entitled  :  "  Nelson  at  Quebec,"  was  written  by  him  for  the 
Toronto  Canadian  Monthly,  and  appeared  in  the  number  for  March,  1879.  Dr. 
Miles  is  likewise  reputed  author  of  an  important  document,  styled  a  "  Memorandum," 
treating  in  minute  detail  of  the  case  of  the  High  Schools  of  Quebec,  Montreal  and 
Kingston,  as  the  successors  of  the  Royal  Grammar  Schools,  established  by  the 
Imperial  bounty  in  those  cities  in  the  early  part  of  this  century,  and  it  is  generally 
believed  that  the  arguments  advanced  in  this  "  Memorandum "  exercised  much 
influence  upon  the  Local  Government  of  the  day  in  securing  the  continued  payment 
of  their  grants  from  the  public  chest,  in  perpetuation  of  the  endowments  originally 
settled  upon  the  institutions  named. 

Dr.  Miles  is  a  member  of  the  Church  of  England,  as  might  be  inferred  from  his 


GAZETTEER  OK  MONTREAL.  415 

connection  witii  Bishop's  College,  and  he  served  as  warden,  and,  we  believe,  in  other 
offices  connected  with  the  cluircli,  and  with  other  societies  whicii  it  has  established. 

In  1847,  he  married  Miss  Elizabeth  Wilson,  daughter  of  William  Wilson,  Ksq., 
B.M,  of  Cambridge,  and  M.D.  of  Edinburgh  College  of  Physicians,  who  practised 
many  years  at  Ripon,  Yorkshire,  prior  to  his  coming  out  to  Canada  10  settle  near 
Sherbrooke,  in  the  Eastern  'I'ownships,  having  discontinued  the  practice  of  the  pro- 
fession. He  died  in  the  year  1851.  Dr.  Miles  was  sujierannuated^  in  1881,  by  the 
Quebec  Government,  and   now   lives  in    Montreal. 

Dr.  Miles  has  four  children,  two  sons  and  two  daughters.  John  C,  the  oldest 
son,  is  connected  with  the  Boston  &amp;  Maine  Railroad,  Boston,  Mass. ;  the  second, 
Henry,  has  been  in  the  Wholesale  Drug  business  of  Lyman,  Sons  &amp;  Co.  since  1870, 
and  for  the  past  five  years  managing  partner.  He  is  one  of  the  proprietors  and 
the  editor  of  the  Montreal  Plixrmaceutical  Journal.  He  is  one  of  the  incor- 
porators of  the  Montreal  Philharmonic  Society,  is  a  Governor  of  the  Montreal 
Dispensary  and  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Trade.  Both  daughters  married,  the 
elder  residing  in  Boston  and  the  younger  in  Quebec. 

H.  A.  NELSON 

Was  born  in  Keene,  New  Hampshire,  on  October  20,  1816,  and  removed  to  Mon- 
real  when  twenty-four  years  of  age,  in  the  year  1840,  entering  into  business  with  the 
late  Isaac  Butters,  under  the  name  of  Nelson  &amp;  Butters.  The  firm  so  existed  until 
1 86 1,  when  Mr.  Butters  retired  on  account  of  ill-health,  and  O.  S.  Wood  look  his 
place,  until  he  retired  from  a  similar  cause  in  1874.  Mr.  Nelson,  then  took  into 
partnership  his  four  sons,  and  the  firm  name  was  changed  to  that  of  H.  A.  Nelson  i\: 
Sons,  which  at  present  it  bears.  In  the  year  1878,  Mr.  Nelson  was  elected  to 
represent  Montreal  Centre  in  the  Quebec  Legislature,  as  a  supporter  of  Mr.  Joly,  and 
represented  the  constituency  for  three  years,  when  he  retired.  But  it  was  as  an 
Alderman  that  Mr,  Nelson  was  best  known.  Occupying  a  seat  in  the  Municipal 
Council  for  the  long  period  of  fourteen  years,  and  for  the  latter  portion  holding  the 
important  post  of  Chairman  of  the  Finance  Committee,  a  position  for  which  he 
proved  himself  singularly  well  fitted,  his  name  will  be  as.sociated  with  what  was  best 
calculated  to  secure  a  judicious  regulation  and  expenditure  of  the  civic  funds,  and 
to  promote  the  best  interests  of  the  city  generally.  In  the  commercial  community 
Mr.  Nelson  was  equally  well  known  and  esteemed.  In  addition  to  building  up  a 
large  and  prosperous  private  business,  he  was  a  trusted  councillor  on  the  boards  of 
several  public  companies  and  institutions.  He  was  a,  Director  of  the  Molsons  Bank, 
President  of  the  Loan  and  Investment  Association,  and. Vice-President  of  the  Pro-- 
vincial  Loan  Association.  The  deceased,  gentleman  was  also  foremost  in  works  of  a 
charitable  natur*,,  and  the  boards  and  committees- of  several  charitable  societies  have 
missed  his  kindly  presence,  his  sympathetic  aid,  and;  his  valued  advice.  Par- 
ticularly, his  death  was  mourned  by  the  pastor  and.  aougregation  of  the  American^

Presbyteritin  Church.  For  many  years  lie  was  an  active  member  of  that  church,  and 
at  his  death  was  senior  elder,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Trustees,  and  Superin- 
tendent of  the  Sunday  School,  in  all  of  which  his  loss  has  been  deeply  felt.  This 
worthy  man  died  at  home  in  Montreal,  on  the  24th  December,  1882.  Speaking  of 
his  demise  on  the  following  day,  the  Gazette  said  : — "  By  his  death  the  community 
loses  a  large-hearted,  upright  and  honorable  citizen,  and  the  city,  one  who  as  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Council  and  in  various  other  capacities  lias  proved  himself  a  man  of 
sound  judgment,  of  sterling  integrity,  and  of  active  and  beneficial  enterprise." 

GEO.  \V.  STEPHENS, 

Son  of  the  late  Harrison  Stephens,  Esq.,  was  born  in  Montreal  and  educated  at  the 
High  School.  He  graduated  in  McGill  College,  and  took  the  degree  of  B.C.L. 
He  was  engaged  for  nine  years  in  commercial  pursuits,  hence  his  value  in  the  Council 
of  Montreal  connected  with  his  legal  acumen.  He  was  admitted  to  practice  Law  in 
November,  1863,  and  elected  to  the  City  Council  in  1868.  Alderman  Stephens  was 
the  promoter  of  the  following  By-Laws  :  "  Prohibiting  the  keeping  of  Pigs  in  the 
City,"  "Planting  Trees,"  "Sale  of  Coal  to  prevent  Fraud,"  "Sale  of  Wood  to  pre- 
vent Fraud,"  "  By-Law  concerning  Nuisances,  Drains,  etc.,"  "  Scavengers,"  and  the 
*'  Carters'  New  Tariff."  He  also  conducted  the  Drill  Shed  and  Road  Committee  Investi- 
gations, and  has  generally  kept  up  a  surveillance  over  speculators  in  the  City  Council. 
His  efforts  have  resulted  in  turning  public  attention  to  the  importance  of  improving 
the  standard  of  public  representatives.  And  so  uncomfortable  has  he  made  it  for 
speculative  Aldermen,  that  they  have,  for  the  most  part  now,  left  the  Council.  The 
Municipal  Legislature  is  improved  in  its  morale,  and  this  is  partly  due  to  his  seven 
years'  strenuous  labors. 

Mr.  Stephens  gained  much  distinction  at  the  Bar  in  conducting  the  great  case 
of  Connolly  vs.  Woolrych  to  a  successful  issue.  This  was  a  cause  cilebre,  and  will 
ever  be  a  leading  case  on  the  Law  of  Marriage  as  applied  to  Indian  marriages  and 
those  by  cohabitation. 

Whilst  at  the  Bar  he  was.  associated  with  J.  A.  Perkins,  the  firm  being  Perkins 
&amp;  Stephens,  and  their  practice  was  very  extensive  and  successful.  He  was  rarely 
absent  from  a  Council  meeting,  and  has  always  been  on  the  side  of  economy  and 
good  government.  He  has  finally  retired  from  the  Council,  but  is  at  present  a  can- 
didate for  representation  in  the  County  of  Huntingdon  for  the  Local  Legislature.

RAOUL  UANDURAND. 

He  was  born  in  Montreal  on  tlie  4tli  of  November,  1861.  His  fiither  was  the  late 
CEdippe  Danduraiid,  nieichant,  and  his  mother,  Marie  Marguerite  Roy.  He  was 
educated  at  Montreal  College,  and  studied  Law  from  July,  1879,  with  the  late  Joseph 
Doutre,  Q.C.,  his  relative,  and  whose  partner  he  became  when  admitted  to  the  Bar 
in  January,  1883.  He  took  his  degrees  at  Laval  University.  He  was,  in  the  follow- 
ing year,  1884,  elected  President  of  the  Club  National,  of  Montreal,  being  only 
twenty-two  years  of  age.  He  married,  January,  1886,  Josephine,  the  second  daughter 
of  the  Hon.  F.  G.  Marchaud,  Speaker  of  the  Legislative  A.sembly  of  (Quebec,  and 
residing  at  St.  Johns.  He  was  ap|)ointed,  in  1888,  a  magistrate,  and  acted  as  such 
for  over  a  year.  He  has  published,  with  Chas.  Lanctot,  Esq.,  lately  appointed  Law 
Officer  of  the  Crown,  a  "  Treatise  on  Criminal  Law,"  and  a  "  Manual  for  Justices 
of  the  Peace."  He  is  a  Liberal,  of  rather  Radical  lineage,  his  father  being  all  his 
life-time  a  member  of  the  Institut  Canadien.  He  has  taken  an  active  part  in  all 
the  political  contests  of  tlie  last  twelve  years.  He  was  made  a  Knight  of  the  Legion 
of  Honor  by  the  French  Government  for  upholding  the  Republican  institutions  of 
that  country.  He  is  the  head  of  the  law  firm  of  Dandurand  &amp;  lirodeur.  Mr. 
Brodeur  is  Member  of  Parliament  for  Rouville.  What  I  said  regarding  those  who 
were  actually  born  in  Montreal,  and,  therefore,  true  Monirealcrs,  can  fitly  be  applied 
to  the  subject  of  this  sketch.  He  is  still  a  young  man,  in  the  thirtieth  year  of  his 
age  ;  but  has  already  held  some  important  positions.  The  beginning  of  next  century 
may  see  him  one  of  the  leading  men  of  Canada.  Whether  or  not,  his  name  will 
never  die,  so  long  as  the  facile  writings  of  his  talented  wife  (daughter  of  a  talented 
father)  survive.  And  when  thousands  now  treading  Montreal's  streets  will  be  for- 
gotten and  unknown,  Madame  Dandurand's  works  will  remain,  a  lasting  testimony  of 
the  development  of  woman's  intellect,  woman's  brains  and  woman's  will,  as  much  as 
that  of  man's.

HON.  JUDGK    I'AGNUKLO 

Was  born  on  the  5lh  January^  1.S40,  in  Lapiairic.  His  father  was  from  Seville, 
Sjjain,  having  conic  lo  this  country  in  1.H12  with  tlic  DcMciiron  regiment.  His 
mother  wa.s  of  French  Acadian  descent.  He  graduated  at  the  Montreal  College,  ii\ 
185.S.  After  a  complete  course  of  studies  he  entered  at  once  the  Law  office  of  Messrs. 
R.  iV  (i.  I.atlam.re,  and  was  admitted  to  the  Mar  on  the  7th  October,  1.S61.  After 
four  years  practice  in  Napiervillc,  he  returned  to  Montreal,  where  he  practised  Law&gt; 
tirst  in  partnership  with  S.  B.  Nagle,  then  with  Kdmund  Harnard.  He  was  on  the 
Law  IJoard  of  Kxaminers  for  several  years. 

Jk'ing  retained  as  counsel  by  the  K(jman  (Catholic  IJisliop  of  Montreal,  in  the 
different  contestations  whicli  arose  in  the  Civil  and  I'icclesiasiical  Courts  regarding 
the  division  of  the  city  and  suburbs  of  Montreal  into  different  parishes,  he  was 
induced  to  make  special  study  of  the  civil  status  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Chinch  in 
Canada.  He  ixiblished  in  1872  a  book  entitled  :  Kttnics  Jlidoriqnes  ct  Lcgales  stir 
la  Libcrti'  Religieiise  en  Caiuxda.  The  lust  part  of  this  book  contains  a  iligesl  on 
the  change  in  the  civil  status  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  Canada,  arising  out 
of  the  Coiupiest  of  the  Country  from  the  freiicii  by  the  English,  and  from  the 
Capitulation  and  Treaty  of  Cession  ;  it  includes  also  a  complete  review  of  the  English 
International  Law,  and  of  the  Imperial  and  i'rovincial  Statutes,  as  well  as  a  history 
of  all  the  facts  bearing  on  the  relations  between  the  State  and  the  ('luirch  of  Kngland, 
the  Dissenters,  the  Jews,  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  Canada.  His  con- 
clusions are  in  favor  of  the  complete  liberty  of  all  Christian  denominations,  and  of 
their  equality  before  the  law,  as  a  fundamental  basis  of  the  Constitution  of  the 
Country  ;  the  second  part  of  the  book  is  devoted  entirely  to  the  (picstion  of  the 
power  of  the  Bishop  to  divide  a  Catholic  religious  parish,  for  religious  j)urposes  only, 
independently  of  the  Government.  Although  the  Catholic  corrimunity  in  the 
Province  of  Quebec  was  then  greatly  excited  and  divided  on  this  question,  it  may  be 
said  that  not  a  single  voice  was  raised  in  its  midst  against  the  tone  or  the  conclusions 
of  this  book  ;  all  the  Bishops  of  the  Province  sent  letters  to  the  author,  some  of  which 
were  most  eidogistic :  even  His  Holiness  the  Pope  honored  the  author  with  a  special 
autograph  Briefs  complimenting  him  on  his  learning  and  the  soundness  of  his 
doctrine. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  also  connected  with  the  Press,  especially  the 
Nouveau  Monde,  to  which  he  was  for  a  time  legal  correspondent  and  reporter. 

He  also  organized  the  first  Lower  Canadian  Agricultural  Insurance  Company, 
which  obtained  its  Charter  from  the  Quebec  Parliament  in  1872,  under  the  name  of 
"  The  Cultivators'  Fire  Insurance  Company  of  the  Province  of  Quebec,"  which  amal. 
gamated  at  once  with  the  ''  Isolated  Risk  Insurance  Company  of  Canada,"  with  its 
head  office  at  Toronto. 

He  married,  in  1863,  Miss  Azilda  Gauthier,  daughter  of  the  late  Arthur  Gauthier 
Esq.,  Notary,  of  Montreal.  After  being  in  partnership  with  some  of  our  best  lawyers,

TiiK  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  in  Calais,  Krancc,  t.Sa6.  llis  father  was  Henry 
Penton,  of  I'entonville,  I,ondon,  Kngland,  and  his  nn)ther,  a  daughter  of  Mr.  Cortlier 
(Ic  la  Housie.  'I'll;.'  family  left  England  after  their  return  from  l''rance,  and  came  to 
Canada  in  the  summer  of  1S32  to  .Sorel.  Mr.  I'entf)n  was  educated  in  the  Island  of 
jersey  (one  of  the  Channel  Islands),  :un\  on  his  arrival  in  (his  coimtry  «-omnienced 
farming.  In  1.S6.:,  ho  came  to  Montreal  and  was  appointed  Superiniendcnl  of  the 
City  Passenger  R^xilway,  which  post  he  resigmd  in  1S65  upon  his  appointment  as 
Chief  of  the  Police  Force  of  the  City,  on  tin-  resignati^)n  of  Chit'f  l.aniothe,  which 
position  he  occupied  tilt  his  death.  Tne  remarks  relative  to  ilic  ••  I'olicc  l'"orce  '' 
are  taketi  from  "  llochelagi  Dopicta,''   .\.l).  1.S3.S: 

"This  l'"orce  was  orgain'/ed  in  consequence  of  an  ()rdinance  issued  during  the 
Admitiisliation  of  the  Karl  of  Durham,  on  the  28th  June,  183S.  It  consists  of  t02 
privates,  four  mounted  patrols,  six  sergeants,  and  six  corporals,  under  the  command 
of  four  officers,  vi/.  :  Capt.  Alexaiulcr  Comeau  and  Lieut.  Worth,  for  division  .\,:in(l 
Capt.  William  Hrown  and  Lieut.  Williiim  Suter.  for  division  15.  The  superintendent 
is  Mr.  P.  Leclere.  The  day  duty  commences  at  7  a.m.  and  ends  at  6  j).m.  Kach 
man  is  on  duly  every  three  hours  in  winter,  and  six  hours  in  summer.  Night  duly 
commences  at  6  p.m.,  and  ends  at  6  a.m.  The  lime  of  relief  in  winter  is  governed 
by  the  weather,  at  the  discretion  of  the  ofHcer  on  duty  :  in  summer,  every  four  hours 
duty  relieves.  The  expetise  is  borne  by  the  Civil  Home  Government,  and  amounts 
to  at  least  six  thousand  pounds  |ier  annimi.  A  book  of  admirable  regulations  has 
been  published  for  the  guidaiKX'  of  the  police,  and  all  its  operations  are  scru[)ulou&gt;ly 
conducted  in  accordance  with  them. 

''  The  jurisdiction  of  the  police  extends  throughout  the  city,  suburbs,  harbor,  and 
Island  of  Montreal,  together  with  the  parishes  of  Laprairie  de  la  Magdelaine,  Lon- 
gueuil,  Boucherville,  Varennes,  Repentigny,  Lachenaie,  .St.  Vincent,  de  Paul,  St. 
Martin,  and  Isle  Perrot." 

This  is  a  very  different  arrangement  from  that  of  the  present  day,  1892.  The 
four  mounted  patrols  would  be  most  beneficial  now.  especially  in  the  outskirts  of 
Montreal.  The  efficient  i)resent  Chief  does  all  that  lies  in  his  power  with  the  force 
at  his  command,  but  it  is  utterly  impossible  to  cover  such  an  extent  as  the  city  now 
does,  with  fool  police  alone. 

JOHN  McCORD,  Senior. 

This  persoua'ie,  the  founder  of  the  McCord  family  in  Montreal,  came  from 
Antrim,  Ireland.  He  was  born  in  1711,  and  died  at  "  The  Grange,"  Montreal,  on 
the  loth  October,  1793.     He  was  the  patentee  of  the  half  of  the  Gaspe  property 


420  GAZETTEER   OP    MONTREAI,. 

which  was  styled  "  O'Hara  and  McCord  Patent."  There  is  perhaps  no  name  so 
intimately  connected  with  the  history  of  the  country  as  that  '^f  McCord.  John 
McCord,  senior,  had  two  sons — John  and  Thomas.  John,  the  elder,  died  at  Quebec 
without  issue,  in  1822,  and  thus  his  branch  of  the  family  became  extinct  as  to  his 
name.  Thomas,  the  younger,  owned  the  greater  part  of  Griffintown,  and  a  street 
there  to  this  day  perpetuates  his  name.  He  represented  the  West  Ward  of  the  City 
in  the  Provincial  Parliament,  and  afterwards  was  the  Police  Magistrate  of  Montreal, 
which  position  he  held  to  the  day  of  his  death,  which  occurred  in  the  year  1824.  He 
left  two  sons,  and  it  is  remarkable  that  both  of  them  afterwards  rose  to  be  Judges  of 
the  Superior  Court  of  the  Province — the  Hon.  John  S.  McCord  and  the  Hon.  Wm. 
King  McCord.  I  find  the  latter's  name  in  the  Records  of  the  Montreal  Prison  and 
in  connection  with  the  Rebellion  ol  1837-38.  He  committed,  as  Justice  of  the  Peace? 
several  prisoners  from  St.  Scholastique  suspected  of  High  Treason.  He  had  one  son, 
Thomas,  who  afterwards  became  Hon.  Thomas  McCord,  Judge  of  the  Superior 
Court.  Hio  daughter  married  tiie  Hon.  Justice  Polette,  The  Hon.  John  S.  McCord 
had  two  sons,  the  representatives  of  the  family  being  ex-Alderman  David  McCord, 
and  Robert  McCord,  late  an  officer  of  the  British  Army,  now  deceased.  The 
mother  of  David  and  Robert  McCord  was  Anne  Ross,  daughter  of  David  Ross, 
Advocate.  The  ex-Alderman  now  attends  entirely  to  tiie  duties  of  his  profession,  and 
has  eschewed  politics  and  civic  affhiirs  for  years  i)ast. 

WILLIAM  LUNN 

Was  born  in  Devonshire,  England,  iStli  July,  1796.     His  father  was  for  many  years 
an  officer  in  the  Dock  Yard  of  Devonport.     The  subject   of  this  sketch  received  his 
education  at  Devonport,  where  he  was  attached  to  the  Dock  Yard  till  1819,  when  he 
arrived  in  Montreal,  being  sent  out  by  the  Admiralty  to  take  the  charge  of  the  Naval 
Stores.     At  this  time  there  was  a  Naval  Establishment  in  each  of  the  five  great  Lakes 
under  the  command  of  a  Port  Captain.     This  continued  till  1834,  when  this  whole 
branch  of  the  service  was  broken  up.  However,  Mr.  Lunn  did  not  return  to  England. 
He  had  in  the  interval  married  in  1821,  and  concluded  to  remain  in  the  country. 
Perhaps  no  man  has  been  more  identified  with  the  educational  interests  of  Montreal 
than  Mr.  Lunn.     He  was  the  means  of  establishing  the  very  first  public  school  in  this 
Province,  the  first  meeting  being  held  in  his  own  parlor.     At  this  time  the  teachers 
were  sent  nut  by  the  British  and  Foreign  School  Society  of  London,  England.     The 
first  school  was  at  the  corner  of  Cotte  and  Lagauchetiere  streets,  and  is  still  a  well- 
regulated  institution  under  the  careful  guidance  of  one  of  the  best  and  most  experiened 
Teachers  of  Montreal — Mr.  Chambers.     For  more  than  thirty  years  Mr.  Lunn  was 
the  Secretary-Treasurer  of  the  Protestant  Board  of  School  Commissioners  of  Montreal. 
He  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the  High  School.     His  wife  died  in  1862.     His  son 
Alexander  Hutchinson,  is  one  of  the  most   prominent    Lawyers  in  Montreal,  being 
associated  in  the  firm  of  Cramp  «Sc  Lunn.     One  daughter  married  Judge  Cross,  of 
Montreal.     Mr.  Lunn  died  some  years  ago,  full  of  years  and  good  deeds,  a  man  who 
had  done  much  in  his  day  to  promote  the  interests  of  the  city  of  his  adoption.

WILLIAM  PALMER 

Was  born  in  Montreal  in  i8iv  of  Englisli  parents.  His  mother  died  in  this  city  at 
the  age  of  ninety-six.  When  a  lad  of  fourteen  lie  commenced  life  in  a  ship  chandler 
store  and  afterwards  in  tlie  grocery  business.  He  was  clerk  afterwards  in  the  whole- 
sale house  of  the  late  Mr.  John  Smith,  so  well  known  in  Montreal  in  his  day.  He 
also  was  in  the  employ  of  the  late  Hon.  James  Ferrier.  In  1836,  a  year  before  tlie 
Rebellion,  he  went  into  business  on  iiis  own  account.  As  an  opportunity  offered  in 
H.  M.  Stores  in  1838,  he  was  then  appointed  by  the  late  Commissary  General,  Sir 
Randolph  Routh,  a  writer  in  his  own  office.  In  1850,  lie  was  recommended  lor  pro- 
motion, on  account  of  his  wonderful  knowledge  of  accounts  and  management  of 
Government  books,  and  the  Lords  Commissioners  of  H.  M.  Treasury  appointed  him 
to  a  Commission  Clerksliip.  and  in  a  very  responsible  position.  He  served  in  Her 
Majesty's  Service  for  upwards  of  thirty  two  years,  one  of  tlie  most  painstaking  and 
conscientious  servants  she  ever  had.  In  1870,  he  was  superannuated,  the  War  Office 
granted  him  two-thirds  of  his  annual  pay  as  pension.  He  is  now  in  the  fifty-sixth 
year  of  married  life,  and  his  wife  and  self  are  in  the  enjoyment  of  good  health. 

Let  me  add  that  I,  the  Author  of  this  book,  look  back  with  pleasure  on  those 
days  of  Montreal's  "  Military  Occupation."  As  Chaplain  to  H.  M.  Forces  for  over 
eight  years,  I  had  much  to  do  with  Mr.  Palmer,  the  subject  of  our  sketch,  and  ever 
found  him  an  earnest  and  obliging  servant  of  the  Queen.  Those  were  the  fine  times 
for  Montreal,  plenty  of  money  circulated  then,  but  then  there  was  also  the  dark  side, 
which,  as  both  military  and  civil  Chaplain,  I  well  knew.  However,  if  we  cannot 
pray  that  these  old  times  return,  let  us  hope  that  our  grand  Dominion  will  yet  be 
an  independent  nation,  forming  at  last  one  of  the  great  Empires  of  the  world,  as  she 
is  now  the  fifth,  maybe  the  fourth,  in  the  scale  of  her  mercantile  marine. 

Mr.  Palmer's  son  is  one  of  the  best  known  faces  in  the  Post  Oftice  of  Montreal. 
After  years  of  patient  service  l:e  was  a  few  days  ago  promoted  to  the  high  position 
of  Deputy  Postmaster  of  Montreal.  This  in  the  son  recognizes  the  worth  and  work  of 
the  sire.  May  they  all  be  spared,  and  that  Mr.  Palmer^  sen.,  reach  his  Diamond  Wed- 
ding— sixty  years  married — he  is  now  in  his  fifty-sixth  year.  All  the  old  military  men  in 
Montreal  should  then  unite  to  "  bounce "'  him.  He  walks  the  streets  to-day  with  such  an 
elastic  step,  looks  "  so  fresh  and  rosy,"  that  the  period  of  his  diamond  wedding  seems 
sure  to  pass,  and  he  will  enter  into  the  almost  unknown  ages  of  .VIethusclah.  Long 
may  he  live.  Say  what  men  will,  our  climate  is  one  of  the  most  health-giving  in  all 
the  world.  Where  I  should  like  to  know  can  be  found  so  many  scores  of  octoge- 
narians and  nonagenarians,  nay  centenarians,  as  found  in  Canada.  May  our  friend

The  subject  of  this  short  sketch  was  a  very  successful  merchant  of  Old  Montreal. 
He  was  associated  with  his  nephew,  a  Mr.  Jones.  His  daughter  was  married  to  J. 
G.  McKenzie,  the  head  of  the  great  house  of  "  J.  G.  McKenzie  &amp;  Co.,"  which  to  this

day  is  still  seen  in  St.  Paul  street.  Tiie  sons  of  J.  G.  McKenzie  were  well  known 
names  in  Montreal,  Hector  and  Fred.  The  latter  was  once  M.P.  for  our  city  in  the 
Federal  Parliament,  and  gave  much  attention  to  the  Society  for  the  Prevention  of 
Cruelty  to  Animals, 

Mr.  Gates  was  appointed  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Council  on  March  i6th, 
1833.  He  was  besides  this,  one  of  the  seven  gentlemen  who  signed  the  requisition, 
calling  the  meeting  to  elect  the  first  Directors  of  the  Bank  of  Montreal,  July  4th, 
1817.  He  was  chosen  one  of  the  Directors,  and  remained  so  to  his  death  years 
after. 

ARTHUR  H.  PLIMSOLL. 

*'  In  this  age  of  progress,  and  especially  in  large  centres  of  commercial  activity  like 
Montreal,  the  services  of  the  chartered  accountant  are  indispensable,  and  their  impor- 
tance cannot  be  overrated.  Among  the  accountants  of  this  city,  Mr.  Arthur  H. 
Plimsoll  is  deserving  of  special  mention.  This  well  and  favorably  known  accountant 
has  been  before  the  public  in  his  profession  since  1875,  and  during  the  intervening 
period  has  met  witii  marked  and  eminently  well  deserved  success  therein,  a  result 
due  mainly  to  his  energy,  superior  executive  ability,  and  high  character.  Mr.  Plim- 
soll is  widely  known  throughout  the  city,  and  his  services  have  also  frequently  been 
engaged  in  many  parts  of  Canada.  As  a  professional  Auditor  he  has  few  equals  in 
the  Dominion,  being  the  annual  auditor  for  many  of  the  largest  public  corporations 
as  well  as  private  concerns,  and  he  is  also  regarded  as  exceptionally  expert  in  the 
examination  of  books  and  intricate  accounts.  Mr.  Plimsoll  is  a  gentleman  popular 
socially  and  otherwise,  and  it  is  needless  to  add  that  he  has  always  enjoyed  and 
retained  the  good  will  and  respect  of  a  host  of  friends.  He  is  the  son  of  one  of  the 
old  Montrealers  who  thirty  years  ago  was  well  known  in  the  mercantile  and  other 
phases  of  Montreal." 

HARRISON   STEPHENS. 

He  was  born  in  Jamaica,  in  the  State  of  Vermont,  in  the  year  1801.  The  Ver- 
monters  have  always  been  renowned  for  energy  and  perseverance;  hence  Mr. 
Stephens,  when  he  arrived  in  Montreal,  in  the  year  1828,  determined  to  show  his 
energy  and  pluck.  Though  a  poor  man,  by  indomitable  industry  and  perseverance, 
he  made  his  mark  commercially  in  the  city.  He  established  tlie  old  and  well-known 
house  of  Stephens  &amp;  Kellogg,  and  was  also  the  senior  partner  in  the  extensive 
establishment  of  Stephens,  Young  &amp;  Co.  He  retired  from  the  firm  in  1845,  and 
spent  the  rest  of  his  life  enjoying,  the  laurels  of  his  well-earned  patrimony.  He 
was  for  several  years  one  of  the  Directors  of  the  Bank  of  Montreal.  His  sons 
enjoy  a  large  share  of  public  respect,  one  being  the  well-known  and  widely  esteemed 
Geo.  W.  Stephens,  Alderman  of  Montreal.  The  residence  of  the  late  Mr.  Stephens 
(now  the  Alderman's),  situated  in  Dorchester  Street,  next  to  St.  James  Club,  is  per- 
haps one  of  the  finest  in  the  city.     He  died  some  years  ago.

VEN.  ARCHDEACON  EVANS,  M.A, 

Lewis  Evans,  Archdeacon  of  Montreal  of  the  Anglican  Church,  comes  from  an 
old  Irish  family.  His  descent  can  be  traced  back  to  Hugh  Evans,  of  Balin- 
robe.  County  Mayo,  Ireland,  and  dates  to  1653.  His  son,  Francis  Evans,  of 
Dublin,  died  June,  1780;  his  son,  Nicolas  Evans,  of  Baymount,  County  Dublin, 
died  June,  1803.  I'rancis  Evans,  of  Rohnstown,  County  Westmeath,  was  a  mem- 
ber of  the  Irish  Bar,  and  died  20th  May,  1834.  His  son,  Francis  Evans,  D.C.L., 
was  the  Rector  of  Woodhouse,  Upper  Canada,  and  died  September  6th,  185S. 
Such  is  the  male  branch  of  the  Evans  family.  The  aaicesiors  of  the  mother  of 
the  Archdeacon  were  named  Lewis,  and  came  of  a  long  line  of  Church  of  Eng- 
land Clergymen  of  that  name. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  at  Woodhouse  Rectory,  County  of  Nor- 
folk, Upper  Canada,  on  the  19th  December,  1845.  He  was  educated  at  Upper 
Canada  College,  won  the  Competitive  Scholarshij)  at  Trinity  College,  Toronto, 
matriculated  in  1863,  and  after  a  curriculum  of  unexceptionable  merit  graduated 
B.A.  in  1870  and  M.A.  in  1871. 

He  then  took  his  Divinity  Term  in  Huron  College,  London,  and  after  due 
course  was  admitted  Deacon  in  1869  and  Priest  in  1870,  by  the  Bishoj)  of 
the  Diocese,  Bishop  Cronyn.  He  was  assistant  in  Christ  Church  Cathedral 
for  three  years,  and  of  whicli  he  was  made  an  Honorary  Canon  in  1873.  Since 
then  he  has  been  the  Rector  of  St.  Stephen's,  having  succeeded  Mr.  Curran,  now 
Canon  Curran,  of  Hamilton,  Ontario.  He  afterwards,  in  1879,  was  appointed  Bishop's 
Chaplain,  a  post  he  yet  occupies,  and  Archdeacon  of  Iberville  in  1881.  On  the 
death  of  the  late  Archdeacon  Leach,  he  received  the  appointment  of  Archdeacon  of 
Montreal,  which  he  still  holds.  He  is  a  man  of  indefatigable  exertion,  and  stops  at 
no  difliculty  in  pressing  on  the  benefits  and  advancement  of  the  Church  at  large. 
Through  his  indomitable  perseverance  one  of  the  most  beautiful  churches  in 
Montreal — St.  Stephen's — has  been  erected,  and  that  too  without  debt.  Where  it  now 
stands,  in  former  years  was  a  wretched  locality,  and  great  has  been  the  change 
which  has  taken  place  by  removing  the  church  congregation  from  its  old  position 
and  building  the  present  edifice,  thanks  to  the  indefatigable  Rector. 

Archdeacon  Evans  has  devoted  a  good  deal  of  his  time  to  the  schools  of  Mon- 
treal. He  is  one  of  the  Protestant  School  Commissioners,  and  has  been  the  means 
of  extending  the  benefits  of  public  education  throughout  the  city.  He  also  takes 
great  interest  in  the  Montreal  Diocese  and  meetings  of  Synod. 

He  married,  in  1873,  Marion  Stewart,  the  eldest  daughter  of  Strachan  Belhune, 
Esq.,  Q.C.,  and  has  a  family  of  sons  and  daughters. 

HON.  JOHN  RICHARDSON. 

Perhaps  no  man  of  his  time  did  more  for  the  development  and  advance  of  Montreal 
than  the  subject  of  this  sketch.  He  was  a  native  of  Banffshire,  Scotland,  having 
been  born  at  Portsoy,  and  the  testimony  of  the  late  Mr.  John  Dougall,  of  the  IVit- 


424  GAZETTEER    OF   MONTREAL. 

ness,  is  worth  here  recording  about  him.  Mr.  Dougall  said  a  few  months  before 
he  died,  that  out  of  all  the  English-speaking  citizens  of  Montreal  to  be  most  beloved 
and  trusted,  he  would  select  three — Hon.  John  Richardson,  Hon.  Geo.  Moffiitt,  and 
Hon.  Peter  McGill ;  and  lie  added  this  excellent  testimony  of  them:  "That  the 
public  of  Montreal  have  never  been  so  well  served  since  as  by  these  three  men  in 
succession." 

Hon.  John  Richardson  represented  tlie  East  Ward  in  conjunction  with  Joseph 
Frobishcr  in  the  very  first  Parliament  of  Lower  Canada.  We  find  him  as  one  of  the 
Commissioners  appointed  to  remove  the  old  fortification  walls  of  the  ciiy  in  1802.  He 
next  appears  in  urging  on  the  Lachine  Canal  in  1821,  where  on  the  17th  July  of  that 
year  he  turned  the  first  sod  of  that  useful  body  of  connecting  water.  In  1825,  he 
was  Chairman  of  the  company  that  completed  it. 

After  the  great  victory  of  Waterloo,  he  was  on  the  list  of  collectors.  A  com- 
mittee was  appointed  by  Sir  G.  Drumrnond  to  obtain  subscriptions  in  aid  of  the  families 
that  were  slain  in  that  terrible  battle.  He  was  also  one  of  the  six  commissioners 
appointed  for  building  Nelson's  Monument.  He  was  a  Director  of  the  first  Savings 
Bank  Montreal  ever  had,  and  a  Trustee  for  looking  after  and  improving  the  highway 
from  Montreal  to  Lachine,  a  most  important  King's  road  in  those  early  days.  He 
was  also  a  Justice  of  the  Peace,  authorized  to  administer  oaths  to  the  half-pay  officers 
of  the  Montreal  District.  He  was,  as  the  honorable  shows  before  his  name,  a  Legis- 
lative Councillor  of  Lower  Canada  in  1821.  This  remarkable  man,  with  Hon.  Wil- 
liam McGillivray  and  Samuel  Gerrard,  formed  a  committee  to  purchase  the  land  on 
which  the  General  Hospital  is  now  built,  and  in  1821,  when  a  large  hospital  was 
about  to  be  erected,  he  was  named  Chairman  to  superintend  its  erection,  and  after- 
wards became  its  first  President.  He  died  i8th  May,  1831,  aged  seventy-six  years. 
After  his  death,  to  commemorate  his  exertions  in  aid  of  the  General  Hospital,  his 
friends  erected  in  what  is  called  tiie  Richardson  wing  a  tablet  with  the  following  in- 
scription: — "This  Building  was  erected  A.  D.  1832,  to  commemorate  the  public  and 
private  virtues  of  the  Hon.  John  Richardson,  a  distinguished  merchant  of  this  city 
and  a  member  of  the  Executive  and  Legislative  Councils  of  the  Province.  He  was 
the  first  President  of  the  Hospital,  and  a  liberal  contributor  to  its  foundation  and 
support." 

PIERRE  BEAU15IEN,  M.D. 

He  was  born  at  La  Baie  du  Febvre,  and  educated  at  the  College  ef  Nicolet.  After 
finishing  his  studies  he  went  to  Paris,  and  graduated  in  the  University  there. 
Returning  to  Montreal,  he  established  a  flourishing  and  lucrative  practice.  He 
married  Justine,  daughter  of  the  late  Hon.  C.  E.  Casgrain,  seigneur  de  la  Riviere 
Onelle.  He  represented  the  City  of  Montreal  from  1841  to  1844,  -''"d  again  had  the 
honor  of  being  elected  for  the  County  of  Chambly  from  1848  to  1851  m  the  Canadian 
Assembly.  Since  then  he  attended  to  the  onerous  duties  of  his  profession,  and  was 
the  visiting  and  consulting  physician  to  the  Hotel  Dieu  and  the  Montreal  Gaol  for  a 
long  period  of  years.  He  was  the  patron  and  Dean  of  the  French  School  of  Medicine  in 
Montreal  in  connection  with  the  Victoria  College,  Ontario,  and  died  some  years  ago. 


DICKSON  AXDKRSON. 


GAZETTEER   OF   MONTREAL.  4*5 


DICKSON  ANDERSON 

Is  the  second  son  of  the  late  William  James  Anderson,  M.D.,  L.R.C.S.,  of  Edin- 
burgh, Scotland,  and  was  born  at  Pictou,  Nova  Scotia,  on  14th  June,  1845.  ^'^ 
younger  days  were  passed  in  schools  at  Toronto  and  Quebec  ;  his  course  of  studies 
having  been  completed  under  the  late  Daniel  Wilkie,  LL.D,,  Principal  of  the 
High  School,  and  afterwards  under  James  Thorn,  the  well-known  teacher  of  (Que- 
bec. He  was  for  a  number  of  years  in  the  employ  of  the  firm  of  J.  C.  DcWoIf 
&amp;  Co.  and  DeWolf  &amp;  Vaughan,  of  Quebec.  He  then  entered  the  employment 
of  the  Quebec  Chronicle^  on  the  staff  of  which  he  remained  for  several  years. 
He  came  to  Montreal  in  1869,  and  commenced  business  as  a  ship-broker  in  connec- 
tion with  Mr.  E.  H.  Duval,  of  Quebec,  under  the  firm  name  of  Duval,  Anderson  &amp; 
Co.  This  firm  was  dissolved  at  the  end  of  two  years,  and  he  formed  a  new  partner- 
ship with  Captain  Charles  H.  McrCenzie,  under  the  style  of  Anderson,  McKenzie  &amp; 
Co.,  continuing  the  business  of  the  old  firm.  Captain  McKenzie  a  few  years  later, 
becoming  tired  of  business,  retired,  and  Mr.  Anderson  continued  it  on  his  own  account 
and  under  the  old  name.  His  business  has  been  a  successful  one.  He  is  largely 
interested  in  shipping,  both  sail  and  steam,  and  his  affairs,  as  a  result  of  his  close 
attention  to  business,  are,  we  believe,  most  promising.  Mr.  Anderson's  father.  Dr. 
Anderson,  was  a  well-known  litterateur  in  Quebec.  Not  only  was  he  President  of 
the  Quebec  Historical  Society,  but  he  published  some  most  interesting  papers,  such  as 
"  The  Gold  Fields  of  Canada,"  and  "  On  the  finding  of  Coal  at  Point  I-evis,  Quebec." 
He  also  was  the  Author  of  the  interesting  "Tourist's  Guide  to  Quebec."  His 
most  important  work,  however,  was  the  "  Life  of  the  Duke  of  Kent  in  Nova 
Scotia."  Mr.  Dickson  Anderson  has  now  been  in  Montreal  over  twenty-two  years, 
and  he  has  done  much  to  increase  the  foreign  trade  of  the  city.  He  is  the  Consul 
for  the  Hawaiian  Kingdom,  and  ranks  high  in  Masonry,  being  Past  Deputy  Grand 
Master,  and  during  his  term  of  office  acting  as  Grand  Master,  owing  to  the  illness  of 
the  Grand  Master.  His  business  consists  of  ship  and  steamship  agent,  forwarder 
and  shipper  of  lumber,  coal  and  deals.  His  two  brothers  are  now  in  Montreal. 
The  elder  of  the  two,  James  W.  Anderson,  is  in  the  lumber  business,  and  represents 
one  of  the  largest  concerns  in  Quebec,  and  the  younger,  William  J.,  is  employed  in 
the  Port  Warden's  office. 


426  OAZETTEER   OF   MONTREAL. 

JUDGK  GILL 

Was  born  at  St.  Fnincis,  Vamaska,  March  12,  1844.  His  father  was  Ignace  Gill, 
who  had  been  twice  elected  to  represent  the  County  of  Yamaska  in  the  Legislative 
Assembly  under  the  Union  from  1854  to  1861.  In  one  of  the  numerous  raids  of  the 
wild  Indians  on  the  New  Kngland  States  in  1700  to  17 10,  Samuel  Ciill  was  taken 
prisoner  by  the  Abenaki  Indians  and  brought  to  the  village  of  St.  Francis.  He  was 
then  fifteen  years  of  age  and  was  adopted  by  the  tribe,  as  was  also  a  young  girl  named 
James,  also  taken  prisoner,  and  who  was  the  daughter  of  a  Church  of  England  minister, 
whose  age  was  twelve.  A  Jesuit  Father  took  care  of  these  two  young  people,  and  in 
process  of  time  (as  a  matter  of  course  and  naturally),  they  married,  the  good  Father 
performing  tiie  ceremony,  much  to  the  chagrin  of  the  Indians,  who  were  anxious  to 
intermix  their  own  blood  by  marriage  with  the  white  man. 

In  1756,  a  Mrs.  Johnston,  who  also  had  been  taken  prisoner  by  these  same 
Indians  and  brought  to  St.  Francis,  tells  us  that  she  was  sold  to  a  man  of  the 
name  of  Gill,  living  in  the  Indian  village,  but  seemingly  far  above  the  Red  Men  in 
every  particular.  He  kept  the  store  of  the  village,  and  often  said  to  Mrs.  Johnston 
that  he  was  of  pure  English  blood.  He  was  one  of  the  sons  of  Samuel  Gill  and  the 
girl  James,  above  mentioned — hence  the  history  of  the  name. 

Judge  Gill  received  his  education  at  the  College  of  Nicolet,  being  tiiere  between 
1856  and  1864.  Leaving,  he  entered  Laval  University,  Quebec,  as  a  Law  Student, 
studying  at  the  same  time  in  the  office  of  Mr.,  afterwards  Justice  Tessier, 
till  1867,  when  in  October  of  that  yr-ar  he  was  called  to  the  Bar  of  the  Pro- 
vince. He  then  went  to  reside  ut  Sorcl  and  practise  Law,  entering  into  partner- 
ship with  the  well-known  Mr.,  afterwards  Chief  Justice  P.  Armstrong,  of  St. 
Lucia  and  the  Tobago  Islands  in  the  West  Indies.  In  January,  1870,  he  was 
married  to  the  eldest  daughter  of  L.  A.  Senecal,  the  Railway  King.  When 
the  General  Elections  took  place  in  1871,  Mr.  Senecal  made  way  for  his  son-in- 
law,  and  he  was  elected  for  the  County  of  Yamaska,  continuing  to  represent  the 
County  till  1874,  when  he  resigned  and  was  immediately  elected  to  represent 
the  same  County  in  the  Commons  of  Canada,  and  again  re-elected  in  1878.  He 
accepted  a  Judgeship  at  the  early  age  of  thirty-five,  on  the  20lh  May,  1879. 
Since  then  nearly  thirteen  years  have  passed,  but  he  still  maintains  the  opinion 
of  his  friends  and  confreres,  that  as  one  said  when  he  saw  him  administering 
justice  among  his  first  cases,  "  He  had  an  old  head  on  young  shoulders."  The 
Judge  resides  in  St.  Denis  street,  and  is  now  connected  with  the  Montreal  Superior 
Court  as  one  of  its  Judges. 

C.  O.   PERRAULT. 

Charles  Ovide  Perrault,  late  Vice-Consul  of  France,  in  Montreal,  is  descended 
from  an  old  French  family  which  came  over  from  Normandy  in  1725,  the  first  settler

Assignees  for  the  District  of  Montreal.  In  1863,  when  in  Paris,  Mr.  Perrault  had 
the  honor  of  being  received  in  an  audience  extraordinaire  at  the  Palace  of  the 
Tuilleries.  He  married,  28th  F'ebruary,  1869,  Emma  Matilda,  daughter  of  Joseph 
Tiffin,  of  Montreal,  but  she  died  on  the  13th  June,  1880.  Mr.  Perrault  died  not

JUDGE  M.  DOIllORTY. 

'*  Hon.  Marcus  Dohkrty  was  born  in  Dungiven,  ('ounty  Derry,  Ireland,  in  i8i8,ancl 
came  to  Canada  in  1835.  He  was  educated  at  Hamilton's  Grammar  School,  Dun- 
given,  at  St.  Hyacintlie  College,  and  at  the  University  of  Vermont,  where  he  gradu- 
ated B.  A.  in  1842,  and  M,  A.  in  1845.  He  was  called  to  the  Bar  in  1848,  having 
studied  in  the  office  of  the  late  R.  S.  M.  Uuuchelte.  For  many  years  he  enjoyed  a 
large  and  lucrative  practice  in  Montreal,  and  was  honored  by  his  confreres  iw.  the  Bar 
by  an  election  as  Syndic  in  1871  and  Uatonnier  in  1872.  Mr,  Doherty  was  twice  a 
candidate  for  the  Mayoralty  of  the  city,  but  was  twice  defeated,  in  1861  by  Hon.  C. 
S.  Rodier  and  in  1866  by  j.  I..  Beaudry.  In  1872,  Mr.  Doherty  was  named  Q.C., 
and  in  1873  he  was  named  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court.  He  has  acted  as  Assistant- 
Judge  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  past  few  years.  During  his  long  judicial 
career  Judge  Doherly's  decisions  have  had  an  almost  unique  exemption  from  reversals 
by  higher  courts,  and  his  judgments,  especially  in  commercial  matters,  have  been 
distinguished  by  sound  common  sense  and  much  learning.  His  courtesy  towards 
the  Bar  and  his  ready  wit  have  made  him  a  great  personal  favorite,  and  he  retires 
with  the  proud  consciousness  that  his  reputation  as  a  pure  and  impartial  magistrate 
is  absolutely  unsullied." 

JIDGE  C.  J.  DOHERTY 

"Was  born  in  Montreal,  May  nth,  1855.  He  was  educated  at  St.  Mary's  College, 
wl:«re  he  graduated  summd  cum  laude  in  1873.  He  studied  Law  at  McCill  University 
and  graduated  there  in  1876,  taking  jointly  with  Mr.  Greenshields,  Q.C.,  the  Eliza- 
beth Torrance  gold  medal.  He  was  admitted  to  practice  in  1877,  and  during  his 
career  at  the  Bar  has  been  engr.ged  in  many  important  cases.  He  conducted  success- 
fully the  defence  of  J.  P.  Whelan  in  the  famous  McNamee  libel  case  ;  was  counsel 
for  Mr.  Lynam  in  the  sensational  proceedings  brought  by  Mr.  Alfred  Perry  for  the 
release  of  Rose  Lynam  from  the  Longue  Point  Asylum  ;  represented  the  Post  in  the 
libel  suit  brought  against  it  by  the  Montreal  Amateur  .\thletic  Association  ;  acted  as 
counsel  in  the  proceedings  for  prohibition  against  the  Royal  Commission,  and  in 
connection  with  the  Statute  Labor  and  Water  tax  litigations  displayed  great  ability 
as  an  expert  in  Municipal  law.  Mr.  Doherty  has  appeared  before  the  Privy  Council 
in  London.  He  was  one  of  the  lawyers  for  the  Society  of  Jesus  in  its  libel  suit  against 
the  Toronto  Mail.  In  1887,  ^^r-  Doherty  was  created  a  Queen's  Counsel,  and  since 
has  been  elected  a  member  of  the  Council  of  the  Montreal  Bar.  On  the  re-organiza- 
tion of  the  McGill  Law  School  he  was  honored  with  the  appointment  of  Professor  of 
Civil  Law  which  he  still  holds.  On  two  occasions  Mr.  Doherty  entered  the  political 
arena  as  candidate  for  Montreal,  being  defeated  both  times  by  Hon.  James  McShane. 
He  was  for  several  years  President  of  the  Junior  Conservative  Club.  He  has  also 
been  President  of  the  University  Literary  Society,  and  Vice-President  of  the  Grad- 
uates' Society,  For  several  years  he  was  President  of  the  Montreal  Branch  of  the  Irish 
National  League,     He  is  now  President  of  the  Shamrock  Lacrosse  Club,     He  was

named  in  1883  a  member  of  the  Royal  Commission  to  invesligatf  the  workings  of 
the  Catholic  and  Protestant  School  Hoards  of  this  city. 

On  the  outbreak  of  the  Kiel  rebellion,  Mr.  Doiierty,  who  then  held  a  commis- 
sion as  captain  of  the  65th  Battalion,  went  with  his  regiment  to  the  North-West,  and 
served  th.oughout  the  entire  affair,  taking  part  in  all  its  marches  and  i.eing  in  com- 
mand of  the  (larrison  at  Fort  Saskatchewan  until  the  withdrawal  of  the  troops. 

Mr,  Doherty  has,  however,  been  essentially  a  lawyer,  and  has  long  been  looked 
upon  as  one  of  the  foremost  men  of  his  years  at  the  I,ower  Canadian  liar.  An  earnest 
student,  his  style  as  a  pleader  is  concise,  vigorous  and  erudite,  and  his  arguments 
have  always  been  conspicuously  free  from  verbosity.  Mr.  Doherty  married  several 
years  ago  a  daughter  of  Mr.  Edmund  Barnard,  Q.C.,  one  of  the  leading  members 
of  the  Montreal  Bar." 

JAMK.S  HKOWN. 
He  was  bom  in  Glasgow  in  1776.  and  came  as  a  lad  to  Quebec.  He  then  married 
at  the  early  age  )f  nineteen.  In  1801  or  1S02  he  removed  to  .Montreal  and  became 
a  bookseller  and  stationer.  He  was  the  first  of  that  class  ever  in  the  city.  He  also 
acquired,  some  time  after,  the  proprietorship  of  the  Gazette  newspaper.  As  such, 
and  in  his  store,  quite  a  number  of  men  were  employed.  About  this  time  an  American 
Company  (Thomas  Mears,  Ware  and  Jackson)  commenced  the  erection  of  a  paper 
mill  at  St.  Andrews,  Province  of  Quebec.  Tiiis  was  the  very  first  paper  mill  in  all 
Canada.  The  first  paper  was  made  in  1805  or  1806.  The  Mill  fell  into  difficulties, 
and  Mr.  Brown  had  to  take  over  as  payment  the  entire  concern,  so  that,  over  and  above 
his  store  and  newspaper,  he  was  obliged  to  manufacture  paper  to  keep  the  mill  going. 
He  industriously  carried  on  the  work  for  some  twenty-five  years,  until  the  lease  of 
the  water-power  expired.  He  also  had  disposed  of  the  Gazette  to  Mr.  Turner  and 
his  shop  and  business  to  other  parties  to  enable  him  to  give  his  attention  to  the  mill. 
Year  after  year  he  lost  heavily  by  it.  He  died  23rd  May,  1845,  '^ged  sixty  years. 
His  son  was  a  well-known  name  in  Montreal  a  quarter  of  a  century  ago— John  O. 
Brown— who  was  one  of  the  best  auctioneers  of  Montreal. 

JOSEPH   QUESNEL 

Was  born  at  St.  Malo,  France,  15th  November,  1749.  After  passing  through  his 
studies  he  took  service  on  board  a  man-of-war,  thus  in  three  years  visiting  Pondi- 
cherry,  Madagascar,  Guinea  and  Senegal,  encountering  numerous  adventures,  and 
arriving  safely  back  to  his  native  land.  The  love  of  roving  had  taken  too  strong  a 
liold  of  him,  and  he  again  left  France  and  visited  French  Guiana,the  Antilles,  Brazil, 
and  finally  established  himself  in  Canada.  He  married  in  Montreal,  and  after  visiting 
the  Valley  of  the  Mississippi,  fixed  his  home  at  Boucherville.  He  is  the  author  of 
an  opera,  "  Lucas  et  Cecile,"  and  "  Les  Republicans  Frangais,"  a  comedy  printed  in 
Paris.  He  also  composed  some  pretty  sacred  pieces  for  the  "  Soci6te  d'Amateurs." 
The  writings  of  Quesnel  are  found  in  the  first  volume  of  the  "  Repertoire  National." 
He  died  in  Montreal,  3rd  July,  1809,  at  the  age  of  about  sixty  years.

NVIIXIAM  IIAI.ES  lIINliSTON,  M.D,. 

Is  the  son  of  the  late  F-icutenanl-ColoiicI  Hiii^'stoii,  forinorly  in  IIlt  Majesty's  looili 
Regiment,  which  came  to  this  country  to  take  part  in  the  hist  American  war,  and 
dill  much  service.  The  Hingstons  had  been  established  in  Ireland  for  centuries,  and 
are  allied  with  the  Cotters  ol"  Cork,  the  ilder  Latouches  of  Dublin,  and  the  Hales 
family  ;  and  on  the  mother's  side  to  the  old  lamily  of  the  Careys.  When  the  numbrr 
of  Regiments  was  reduced,  after  the  close  of  the  war.  the  loolh  became  the  (^ylh, 
and  was  only  disbanded  several  years  afterwards,  when  Colonel  lling^lon  selected  a 
pretty  spot  on  the  banks  of  the  Chateauguay  River,  near  Huntingdon.  There  he 
organized  the  Militia  I'orce,  I.ord  Dalhousie  giving  him  command  of  the  County  of 
Huntingdon  ;  and  subseipienlly,  Sir  James  Kempt,  of  the  County  of  Heaiiharnois. 
The  wounds,  however,  he  had  received  ni  action,  especially  one  through  the  groin 
at  the  battle  of  Chippewa,  which  had  lamed  him,  terminated  his  life  early,  when  the 
subject  of  our  notice  -one  of  six  children— was  only  eighteen  months  old.  At 
thirteen  he  was  sent  to  the  Montreal  College,  where  at  the  end  of  his  hrsl  year  he 
obtained  the  prize  in  every  branch,  carrying  three  first  and  two  second,  while  his 
chief  opponent,  the  late  Superior  of  the  College,  obtained  the  remaining  two  fust  and 
three  second.  He  afterwards  spent  a  couple  of  years  in  studying  I'harmacy  with 
R.  VV.  Rexford,  when  he  entered  upon  the  study  of  Medicine  at  McCiill  University. 

He  graduated  at  the  end  of  four  years,  and  immediately  left  for  Kdinburj^h,  to 
obtain  the  Surgeon's  diploma  of  that  University;  and  by  practicing  the  mo^t  rigid 
economy  he  succeeded  i'l  visiting  England  and  Ireland  also,  and  almost  every  country 
in  Europe,  spending  the  greater  part  of  his  time  in  the  hospitals  and  bringing  back 
with  him  diplomas  from  Scotland,  France,  Prussia,  Austria  and  Bavaria.  One,  the 
membership  of  the  l-eopold  Academy,  purely  honorary  and  given  only  to  Authors, 
was  the  first  ever  obtained  by  a  Caradian,  Sir  William  Logan  and  T.  Sterry  Hunt 
being  the  next  recipients  of  the  honor.  He  had  almost  made  up  his  mind  to  settle 
in  Edinburgh,  as  assistant  to  Professor  Simpson,  but  yielded  to  the  well-understood 
wishes  of  his  mother  and  returned  to  Canada. 

Dr.  Hingston  began  the  practice  of  his  profession  in  the  City  of  Montreal,  in 
1853,  taking  up  his  residence  in  McCiill  street.  Here  his  urbanity  of  manner,  his 
punctuality,  promptitude,  strict  attention  to  the  minutest  details  of  his  profession, 
and  his  uniform  kindness  and  gentleness  of  disposition  towards  all,  with  his  gen- 
erosity to  the  suffering  poor,  soon  won  for  him  the  goodwill  of  those  with  whom 
he  came  in  contact,  and  secured  for  him  a  rapidly  extending  practice.  Cholera  visited 
the  city  in  1854,  and  was  most  severely  felt  in  Griffiniown.  Being  the  nearest 
physician  to  that  locality,  the  Doctor  had  abundant  opportunity   of  ministering  tc 

the  relief  of  the  afflicted. 

A  few  years  afterwards,  he  removed  into  a  house  of  his  own  ni  Bonaventure 
street.  Afterwards,  he  removed  to  Beaver  Hall,  where  he  resided  until  1872,  when 
he  purchased  a  residence,  corner  of  Union  Avenue  and  St.  Catherine  street.  His 
house  and  the  block  have  been  pulled  down  to  make  room  for  Morgan's  magnificent 


liAZhTIKKk   Ol     MONIKEAL.  43 1 

Stoic  which  now  stands  in  their  place.     The  Doctor  has  bought  a  house  still  higher  up 
in  Sherhrookc  street  where  he  now  resides. 

Di.  ilingston  has  now  occupied,  for  ni.my  years,  a  most  prominent  position  in 
Montreal,  as  a  leading  member  of  his  profession  — especially  in  surgery  —  his  ''  first 
love,"  as  the  Cdiiiu/a  Mediid/  Jotirnal  slates  ;  ami  having,  at  the  present  time, 
besides  a  laif;e  (,'ity  jjractic  e,  one  of  the  very  largest  consulting  practices  in  (."anada — 
c.dling  him  freipientiy  to  visit  outlying  towns  and  ciiics.  and  not  unficipieiitly  to  the 
neighboring  Stales. 

Soon  after  beginning  practice.  Dr.  Ilingston  received  unsolicited,  tlu'  ap|.oinl- 
ment  of  Surgeon  to  the  I'aiglish-speaking  department  of  tin-  Hold  Dieii  Hospital, 
and  has  been  unremitting  in  his  attendance  upon  the  suffering  inmates  of  that  I'xcel- 
lent  institution.  There  he  has  iiad  the  largest  field  in  this  country  for  the  exi,'rc'se 
of  his  c.dling,  and  has  accpiired  a  (lexteiiiy  and  precision  in  operating  which  is  un- 
usual. Many  &lt;jf  the  more  dilTiculi  and  hazardous  operations  in  surgery  have  been 
there  introduced  by  him  to  the  profession  in  (Janada,  such,  foi  instance,  as  excision 
of  the  knee-joint,  acquired  deformities,  and  llie  successful  removal  of  the  tongue  and 
lower  jaw,  at  the  same  time. 

Though  altaciied  to  no  Medical  .School,  Dr.  ilingston  has  largely  availed  him- 
self of  the  material  at  his  disposal  in  the  hospital  for  i)raclically  instructing  the 
medical  students  who  attended  il.  Iwery  day,  for  many  years,  clinical  instruction 
was  given — the  Doctor  receiving  no  pecuniary  reward  therefrom.  Hut  as  the  young 
gentlemen  whom  he  instructed  graduated  in  Medicine,  and  scattered  themselves 
over  the  country,  they  gave  many  evidences  of  their  gratilude  to.  and  confidence  in 
their  generous  instructor,  and  have  largely  assisted  in  building  \\\&gt;  his  rei)utation. 

Again  visiting  Europe,  in  1867,  one  of  his  masters,  Professor  (  afterwards  Sir 
James)  Simpson,  paid  a  high  tribute  to  Canadian  Surgery  in  the  person  of  Doctor 
Hingston  by  inviting  him  to  perform  a  surgical  operation  of  difiiculty  on  one  of  his 
(Sir  James')  patients  ;  and  on  speaking  of  him,  a  few  weeks  afterwards,  in  a  Ihitish 
Medical  Journal  of  the  time.  Sir  James  styles  him  "that  distinguished  American 
Surgeon  lately  amongst  us."  He  should  have  said  Canadian,  but  to  this  day  we  are 
called  American  by  the  old  country  people. 

As  a  graduate  of  McGill  University  he  was  one  of  a  few  gentlemen  to  organize 
the  McGill  University  Society,  and  to  advocate  and  secure  the  appointment,  from 
among  the  graduates,  of  Convocation  Fellows  to  the  University.  The  late  Hon. 
Alexander  Morris,  Mr.  JJrown  Chambtrlin  and  himself  were  the  first  ofilce-bearer.s 
in  the  McGill  University  Society,  a  society  founded  chiefly  for  the  purpose  named  ; 
but  he  alone,  we  believe,  never  occupied  that  position  in  the  University  he  was 
instrumental,  in  part,  in  obtaining  for  his  fellow  graduates. 

When  IJishop's  College  Medical  School  was  organized  by  the  late  Dr.  Small- 
wood  and  Dr.  David,  Dr.  Hingston  was  named  Professor  of  Surgery,  and  afterwards 
Dean  of  Faculty,  both  of  which,  however,  he  was  forced  to  resign  as  the  duties  were 


432  GAZETTEER    OF    MONTREAL. 

incompatible  with  his  position  at  the  Hospital.     He  received  the  degree  of  D.C.L. 
trom  the  University  of  Lennoxville  in  1871. 

When  the  Dominion  Medical  Association  was  formed,  Dr.  Kingston  was 
appointed  first  Secretary  for  the  Province  of  Quebec ;  and  a  few  years  ago,  he  was 
unanimously  elected  representative  of  the  profession  for  the  same  Province.  During 
his  connection  with  the  Association  he  contributed  several  papers  on  medical  sub- 
jects. 

He  was  unanimously  elected  Governor  of  the  College  of  Physicians  and  Sur- 
geons of  Lower  Canada,  in  the  place  of  the  late  Dr.  Smallwood. 

One  of  the  founders  of  the  Medico-Chirurgical  Society  of  Montreal,  l.e  has  three 
times  held  the  position  of  Vice-President,  and  twice  that  of  President,  no  small 
honor  in  a  city  where  the  i)rofession  stands  so  high,  and  a  (ah  indication,  it  may 
be  presumed,  of  the  estimation  in  which  he  is  held  by  his  professional  brethren; 
while  the  unanimity  with  which  he  was  called  upon  to  accept,  and  apparently  with 
great  reluctance  on  his  part,  the  Civic  Chair  by  the  members  of  his  own  profession 
as  well  as  by  the  public  at  large,  is  the  best  testimony  that  could  be  given  of  the 
esteem  in  which  he  is  held  by  all  classes  and  conditions  of  the  community.  The 
boldness  and  frankness  of  the  inaugural  address  of  the  new  Mayor  was  of  a  char- 
acter to  call  forth  encomiums  from  the  Press  generally — the  IVitucss  speaking  of  it 
as  equalling  Gladstone's  efforts,  in  clothing  the  dryest  material  ia  poetic  language. 

The  ease  and  elegance  with  which  Dr.  Hingston  writes  render  it  a  matter  of 
regret  to  medical  readers  that  he  does  not  contribute  so  frequently  as  formerly  to  the 
Medical  Press  of  the  country.  For  several  years.  Dr.  Hingston  wrote  largely.  Morgan, 
in  his  Bibliotheca  Canadensis,  meiitions  a  dozen  of  papers  from  his  pen,  the  more 
important  beftig  on  the  state  of  medicine  in  Paris  and  Berlin  ;  and  a  series  of  papers 
on  the  climate  of  Canada  in  its  sanitary  aspects.  This  latter  paper  the  Doctor,  a 
personal  friend  of  the  Author  of  this  sketch  and  for  many  years  his  family  physician, 
wrote  especially  for  The  British  American  Reader,  the  first  of  the  Author's  books 
introduced  into  Catholic  and  Protestant  schools  alike,  and  by  School  Act  once  the 
basis  of  the  Examination  in  Dictation,  etc.,  of  Candidates  for  school  diplomas  for  the 
Province  of  Quebec.  As  years  have  rolled  on,  however,  and  as  professional  duties 
have  been  multiplied,  Dr.  Kingston's  efforts  in  that  direction  have  been  less  frequent, 
and  of  a  more  desultory  character  ;  only  being  called  forth  in  connection  with  some 
circumstances  or  study  of  special  interest. 

He  is  a  member  of  the  Royal  College  of  Surgeons,  Edinburgh,  besides  the 
honorary  titles  of  D.C.L.  and  M.L.A.,  and  other  lately  acquired  degrees  and  dis- 
tinctions. Dr.  Hingston  has  received  at  the  hands  of  Universities  and  Societies  every 
honor  it  was  possible  to  confer.  The  British  Medical  Association,  the  American 
Medical  Association  and  the  State  Societies  of  New  York,  Massachusetts,  and  Michi- 
gan elected  him  to  honorary  membership.  Dr.  Hingston  married,  in  1875,  Margaret, 
daughter  of  the  Hon.  D.  A.  Macdonald,  then  Lieutenant-Governor  of  Ontario,  and 
has  four  sons  and  one  daugliter.

HON.  JUDGE  DeLORIMIER,  LLD. 

Charles  Chamilly  DeLorimier  was  born  September  13,  1842,  at  Dubuque, 
Iowa,  U.S.A.  His  father  was  J.  B.  Chamilly  DeLorimier,  advocate  of  Montreal,  and 
his  mother,  Rachel  Cadieux  de  Courville.  He  was  educated  at  the  Jesuits  College 
of  St.  Mary's.  Even  when  a  young  student  he  showed  signs  of  his  love  of  literature 
by  composing  a  very  interesting  brochure  entitled,  "Three  Days'  Fete  at  St.  Mary's 
College."  He  afterwards  studied  Law  under  Maximilien  Bibaud  and  Achille  Bell, 
advocates.  During  his  curriculum  Judge  DeLorimier  was  elected  President  of  the 
Catholic  Union  for  the  academic  year  1861-62.  He  was  made  delegate  to  repre- 
sent this  Society  in  the  Catholic  Congress  held  at  Quebec  in  1880.  He  was  admitted 
to  the  Bar,  September  4th,  1865,  and  practised  with  his  brother,  T.  C.  DeLorimier  ; 
then  with  D.  Girouard,  Q.C.,  M.P.  for  Jacques  Cartier  County.  Judge  DeLorimier 
was  elected  a  member  of  the  Council  of  the  Bar  in  1878,  and  appointed  one  of  the 
Examiners  lor  the  District  of  Montreal,  and  occupied  for  three  successive  sessions  the 
high  distinction  of  Syndic  of  the  Bar  of  Montreal.  It  was  when  he  was  thus  honored 
that  he  was  instrumental  in  reforming  the  condition  of  the  bailiffs.  He  was  the 
chief  one  in  getting  this  profession  recognised  as  a  Corporation,  and  went  to 
plead  their  cause  before  the  Legislature  at  Quebec.  This  important  step  resulted  in 
this  body  of  men  now  having  an  Act  of  Incorporation  and  Bye-laws  to  govern  them- 
selves. 

He  was  one  of  the  founders  of  Za  T/ienis,  a  public  review,  from  1879  to  1884 
along  with  the  late  Hon.  T.  J.  J.  Loranger,   fudge. 

His  principal  work  was  commenced  in  1870,  and  entitled  "  Bibliotheque  de 
Code  Civil."  This  great  undertaking  consisted  of  eighteen  volur-,s,  and  is  found  in 
every  library  of  any  advocate  of  importance.  Another  important  work  is  his  "  Cours 
de  Droit  Criminel." 

From  1873  to  1875,  he  filled  the  situation  of  Crown  Prosecutor  for  the  District 
of  Terrebonne.  He  was  created  a  Q.C.,  September  12,  1879,  by  the  Quebec  Govern- 
ment, and  also  October  3,  1882,  by  the  Dominion  Government  of  Canada.  He  was 
Professor  of  Criminal  Law  in  Laval  University  in  1880,  and  in  1882  it  conferred  on 
him  the  title  of  LL.D.,  Doctor  of  Laws.  In  1886,  he  was  named  "  Procureur"  of 
the  "Credit  Foncier."  On  the  15th  April,  1889,  he  was  raised  to  the  high  honor  of 
being  appointed  a  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court  of  the  Province  of  Quebec,  and  the 
choice  never  fell  on  one  more  suitable  and  more  capable,  or  on  one  who  knew  more 
of  Law  in  all  its  phases  and  departments. 

In  1865,  the  Judge  married  Delle.  St.  Jean,  of  Montreal,  and  has  four  children

HON.  LOUIS   BEAUBIEN. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  is  the  son  of  the  late  Pierre  Beaubien,  Esq.,  M.D.,  and  is 
descended  from  Trottier  de  Beaubien,  who  came  to  Canada  from  Perche,  France,  in 
1650.  He  was  born  in  1837,  and  was  educated  at  St.  Sulpice  College  of  this  city. 
He  entered  public  life  in  1867,  being  returned  for  Hochelaga  County  in  the  Legis- 
lative Assembly,  which  he  represented  up  to  1885.  He  was  also  elected  to  the 
House  of  Commons  in  1872,  which  seat  he  held  until  1874,  when  dual  representation 
was  abolished.  He  was  Speaker  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  from  1876  to  1878. 
He  has  to  a  great  extent  devoted  himself  to  agriculture  and  improving  the  breed  of 
cattle  and  horses  in  the  Province,  and  to  this  end  has  succeeded  in  establishing  a  fine 
stud  farm  called  the  "  H arras  Nanonal."  He  was  an  active  promoter  of  the 
Montreal  Colonization  Railway,  and  was  vice-president  of  the  same.  The  Laurentides 
Railway  also  received  great  assistance  from  him.  He  has  served  in  the  Volunteers, 
and  held  the  rank  of  Captain  in  the  old  Chasseurs  Canadiens,  now  the  65th  Bat- 
talion. Mr.  Beaubien  has  had  long  experience  as  a  legislator,  and  is  looked  upon  as 
a  safe  man.  He  is  a  fair  speaker,  and  an  authority  on  Agriculture.  He  married,  in 
1864,  Susanne  Lauretta,  daughter  of  the  late  Hon.  Justice  Stuart,  of  Quebec.  He  is 
now  in  tlie  Cabinet  of  the  Province,  sirce  the  dismissal  of  the  Mercier  Govenmient 
in  December  last,  as  Minister  of  Agriculture.  Mr.  Beaubien  has  done  a  good  deal, 
not  only  for  the  agriculture  of  his  country,  but  in  many  other  ways,  and  his  career 
is  not  without  results  already  shown  of  his  competency  and  ability. 

F.  M.  LEPAILLEUR. 

Thk  following  sketch  is  taken  from  an  interview  with  Mr.  Lepailleur  some  short  time 
before  his  death.  He  says  :  "I  wasborn  at  Boucherville,  but  had  been  a  resident  '"01 
some  years  at  Chateauguay,  when  the  Insurrection  broke  out.  During  1837  nothing 
of  any  importance  took  place  in  that  locality.  In  1838,  however,  the  inhabitants 
were  much  moved  by  what  had  taken  place  elsewhere,  and  decided  to  take  a  hand 
in  the  movement  which  in  our  eyes  solely  tended  towards  securing  the  independence 
of  the  country.  Those  who  were  most  active  in  organizing  in  our  locality  were 
Cardinal,  Duquette,  Dr.  Newcombe  and  Jos.  Dumouchel.  I  was  unwilling  at  first  to 
mix  in  the  affair,  but  when  I  was  told  we  would  receive  assistance  from  the  United 
States  I  went  in  with  the  others.  Previous  to  this  I  had  assisted  Cardinal  and  Dr. 
Robert  Nelson  in  escaping  to  the  United  States.  When  the  former  returned  we  began 
meeting  in  small  numbers  in  secret,  and  finally  some  two  hundred  of  the  inhabitants 
of  the  place  had  been  initiated.  Things  went  on  quietly  enough  until  the  first  days 
of  November,  when  we  were  informed  by  Cardinal  and  Duquette  that  they  had  been 
ordered  by  Mr.  joiin  Macdonald,  a  lawyer  in  Montreal,  who  was  looked  upon  as  the 
head  centre,  that  we  were  to  march  to  Caughnawaga  and  there  receive  arms  from  the 
Indians.  On  the  evening  of  November  3,  some  two  hundred  of  us  met  by  appoint- 
ment at  the  Church  door,  many  of  us  armed,  but  the  majority  unarmed.  It  was  about 
nine  o'clock  when  we  started  to  cover  a  distance  of  about  six  miles.     We  made  but 


GAZETTEER  OK  MONTREAL.  '  435 

slow  progress ;  the  roads  were  very  muddy  and  we  were  in   no  particular  hurry 
Towards  tlie  dawn  of  day  we  halted  at  the  outskirts  of  the  wood,  just  outside  the 
village.     It  appears  that  Cardinal  and  Duquette  had  received  a  promise  from  Mr. 
George  DeLoriniier,  a  resident  of  the  place,  that  they  would  receive  assistance  in  the 
way  of  aims,  etc.     Our  intention  was  to  then  march  back  to  Beauharnois  and  there 
join  the  Patriots.     Cardinal,  Duquette  and  Newcombe  left  us  in  the  wood  and  went 
into  the  village  to  confer  with  DeLorimier.  They  were  a  longtime  away, and  I  began 
to  grow  suspicious  that  all  was  not  as  we  expected.     Some  of  the  men  began  disper- 
sing, and  Cardinal  and  Duquette  said  that  they  had  been  led  into  a  trap,  and  they 
escaped  along  the  river  front.     DeLorimier  and  some  of  his  friends  had  given  the 
alarm,  and  the  whole  body  of  Indians,  some  two  hundred  strong,  were  preparing  to 
make  us  prisoners.     We  did  not  expect  a  fight  and  consequently  did  not  prepare  for 
it.     I  was  standing  near  the  old  Chapel  on  the  Chateauguay  road,  quite  near  to  the 
village,  when   I  saw  DeLorimier  coming  towards  me  with  a  large  number  of  armed 
Indians.     As  he  came  up,  1  said  :  '  Where  is  Cardinal  and  Duquette  ?  '     'I  did  not 
see  them,'  he  replied,  and  then  he  added,  '  yes,  they  were  at  my  place,  but  they  are 
gone.'     While  this  conversation  was  going  on,  I  saw  that  we  were  being  surrounded. 
I   was  armed  with   two  revolvers,  but  did  not  attempt  to  use  them.     My  friends 
wanted  to  fire,  but  I  prevented  them,  and  we  were  all  made  prisoners.     I  received  a 
slight  scratch  on   the  hand,  caused  by  one  of  tiie  Indians,  but  nothing  more.     No 
shots  were  fired  and  no  one  was  injured. 

"  We  had  fallen  into  a  trap  which  had  evidently  been  prepared  before  hand. 
We  were  taken   to  the  village  under  this  strong  escort  and   thence  crossed  over 
to   Lachine  in  boats.     Here  about  one  hundred  armed  men  surrounded  us,  and 
the  march  into  the  city  was  commenced.     The  roads  were  very  bad  and  we  were  all 
covered  with  mud,  and  many  were  nearly  exhausted  for  want  of  rest  and  nourishment. 
No  demonstration  took  place  along  the  road  ;  but  in  the  city  a  large  crowd  followed 
us,  flinging  epithets  which  were  not  very  complimentary.    The  word  '  rebels '  .sounded 
over  all.     It  was  two  o'clock  when  we  reached  the  gaol  (the  present  one),  and  I  was 
the   first   to  enter  it.     Our  feelings  can  better  be  imagined  than  portrayed.     Our 
names  were    taken    and  food  was   given   us.     We   remained  for  a  couple  of  days 
together,  but  after  that  we  were  confined  to  the  cells  and  saw  very  little  of  each 
other.     It  was  ten  o'clock  that  night  when  Cardinal  and  Duquette  were  brought  in. 

"  Four  days  later  Sir  John  Colborne  suspended  the  habeas  corpus  and  proclaimed 
martial  law.  On  the  27th  the  court  martial,  composed  of  Major-General  Clitherow 
and  fifteen  officers,  was  constituted,  and  on  the  28th  the  trials  commenced.  At  nine 
o'clock  on  that  day  twelve  of  us  were  taken  up  for  trial  under  strong  guard  to  the 
old  Court  House  which  stood  on  the  square  before  the  present  Court  House  and 
City  Hall.  Large  crowds  witnessed  our  arrival.  The  court  room  was  small,  and  but 
few  uninterested  spectators  were  admitted.  The  members  of  the  Court  sat  around  a 
table  and  we  stood  in  a  corner  of  the  room,  twelve  of  us.  Cardinal,  Duquette, 
Thibert  and  myself  among  the  number.     The  prosecution  was  carried  on  by  Mr.  D. 


436  GAZETTEER  OF  iMONTREAL. 

Mondelet,  Mr.  C  D.  Day,  and  Captain  Muller,  who  were  styled  Judge-Advocates. 
We  were  defended  by  Mr.  Lewis  T.  Drummond  and  Mr.  Pierre  Moreau,  whom  we 
had  sent  for.  The  trials  lasted  several  days.  A  large  number  of  witnesses  were 
examined.  I  did  not  attempt  to  disprove  the  facts  alleged,  but  produced  two  wit- 
nesses as  to  character.  Proceedings  were  carried  on  in  a  summary  manner.  When  the 
trial  was  over  we  were  brought  back,  and  the  next  day  we  were  told  that  we  had  all 
been  sentenced  to  death,  and  were  called  into  the  gaoler's  room,  where  the  sentences 
were  read  to  us.  Cardinal,  Duquette,  J.  1'.  Thibert  and  myself,  however,  had  not  been 
recommended  to  clemency,  and  therefore  we  did  not  expect  to  be  commuted.  We 
therefore  expected  to  die,  but  when?  That  was  the  great  question.  On  Tuesday 
afternoon,  December  18,  Cardinal  was  called  into  the  gaoler's  quarters.  You  may 
imagine  with  what  intense  interest  we  awaited  his  coming  out.  He  returned  in  a  few 
minutes  as  calm  as  ever,  and  merely  said  :  '  My  friends,  I  expected  it ;  I  am  to  die, 
Friday.'  Poor  young  Duquette  was  next  called  in,  and  a  moment  later  he 
returned.  He  had  also  been  told  to  prepare  for  death  on  the  same  day.  It  was  hard 
for  him  to  die  while  still  so  young,  but  he  faced  his  dreadful  fate  with  fortitude.  My 
anxiety  continued.  I  was  preparing  to  die,  and  was  expecting  to  be  informed  of  the 
date  every  minute.  The  day  passed,  however,  and  I  thought  that  tlie  execution  had 
been  postponed  for  a  week,  and  that  my  turn  would  come  on  the  following  Friday.  I 
saw  very  little  of  poor  Cardinal.  He  recommended  to  me  his  wife  and  children  ;  he 
seemed  to  regret  to  die  only  on  their  account.  Cardinal's  wife  came  often  to  see  him, 
and  heartrending  scenes  followed.  Duquette's  widowed  mother  was  with  him  until 
the  eve  of  the  execution.  Those  were  sad  days  all,  I  can  tell  you.  On  the  morning 
fixed  for  the  dual  execution  we  awoke-  early.  Rev.  Father  Labeile,  Cure  of  Chateau- 
guay,  who  had  prepared  Cardinal  and  Duquette  for  the  next  world,  celebrated  Mass, 
at  which  the  whole  twelve  of  us  assisted  and  partook  of  Communion,  after  which  I 
retired  to  my  cell  after  one  last  farewell  to  my  friends.  I  saw  them  pass  on  their 
march  to  the  scaffold,  shortly  before  eleven  o'clock,  accompanied  by  the  priests  and 
the  officers  of  the  gaol ;  that  was  the  last  time  I  saw  them.  I  did  not  witness  the 
execution,  which  took  place  in  presence  of  a  large  crowd  over  the  entrance  to  the 
gaol.  Neither  of  them  spoke.  Cardinal  died  without  a  struggle,  but  poor  Duquette 
met  with  a  terrible  fate.  The  rope,  it  appears,  had  been  badly  adjusted,  and  when 
he  fell,  his  face  struck  against  the  side  of  the  scaffold  and  became  covered  with 
blood.  His  agony  was  frightful  ;  he  had  to  be  launched  by  the  hangman  a  second 
time.  I  am  not  aware  where  his  remains  lie,  but  those  of  Cardinal  I  had  removed 
from  the  old  cemetery,  Dominion  Square,  some  years  ago  to  Cote  des  Neiges  ceme- 
tery and  over  them  now  stands  the  monument  erected  to  the  memory  of  the  Men  of 
1837-38-  Two  days  after  the  execution  of  my  two  friends,  I  was  informed  by  Rev. 
Abbe  Quiblier,  Superior  of  the  Sulpicians,  that  I  would  be  saved.  I  was  never  able 
to  ascertain  by  what  influence  this  was  done,  but  I  have  always  suspected  that  my 
wood  angels  were  my  two  aunts,  two  cloistered  nuns  who  spent  sixty  years  of  their 
lives  in  the  Hotel  Dieu.     Having  been  removed  to  another  cell  in  the  meantime  I 


GAZETTEER  OF  MONTREAL.  437 

was  an  unwilling  witness  of  the  executions  of  Robert,  Hamelin,  the  two  Sanguinets 
and  Decoigne,  on  January  i8,  and  of  Narbonne,  Nicolas,  Daunais,  Hindelang  and 
DeLorimier,  on  February  12,  following. 

"  I  will  never  forget  those  horrible  sights  as  long  as  I  live.  The  executions  took 
place  on  the  prison  wall  over  the  entrance,  and  were  witnessed  by  immense  throngs. 
I  remained  in  prison  until  September  29,  following,  when  with  fifty-seven  others  I 
was  placed  on  board  of  a  sailing  vessel,  and  left  for  Australia,  to  which  country  we 
were  transported.  Our  leaving  our  country  with  our  families,  helpless  women  and 
children,  was  painful  to  a  degree.  We  never  knew  when  we  would  return.  At  Quebec 
we  were  transported  to  a  man-of-war,  and  then  we  proceeded  on  our  long  journey 
■  to  Sydney,  New  South  Wales,  where  we  landed.  For  the  first  two-and-a-half  years 
we  were  detained  in  a  penal  establishment,  just  outside  of  the  city,  and  given  hard 
work.  Through  the  intervention  of  Mgr.  Folding,  Bishop  of  Sydney,  with  Sir  John 
Russell,  we  obtained  our  liberty,  but  were  not  free  to  return  to  Canada  until  two 
years  and-a-half  later.  All  of  us  returned  except  two,  one  who  had  died  and  another 
who  settled  in  Australia.  I  arrived  in  Montreal  on  January  19,  1 845,  after  having 
gone  through  enough  experience  to  satisfy  any  man." 

Some  years  later,  Mr.  Lepailleur  married  Cardinal's  widow,  and  was  the  means 
of  assisting  in  bringing  up  his  family,  and  of  thus  carrying  out  his  friend's  last  wish. 
The  old  gentleman  died  not  long  since,  almost  the  last,  if  not  the  last,  of  the  Patriots 
ofi837-i838. 

HON.  JUDGE  SANBORN. 

Thk  late  Judge  John  Sewell  Sanborn  is  better  known  in  Siierbrooke  than  in  Montreal. 
He  was  an  Advocate  for  twenty-five  years  in  that  city.  The  subject  of  this  sketch 
was  born  at  Gilmonton,  New  Hampshire,  U.S.A.,  ist  January,  1819.  He  then 
studied  at  Dartmouth,  graduating  thence  both  B..\.  in  1842  and  M.A.  in  1845.  He 
also  received  an  M.A.  from  Bishop's  College,  Lennoxville,  in  1855.  From  the  latter 
College  he  was  made,  in  1873,  a  Doctor  of  Civil  Law,  D.C.L.  Next  year,  he  received 
the  honorary  degree  of  LL.D.  from  his  Alma  Mater. 

After  Judge  Sanborn  left  Dartmouth,  he  came  to  Sherbrooke,  where  he  taught 
as  Principal  of  the  .Academy  for  three  years ;  meanwhile,  studying  Law  with  Mr. 
Justice  Short,  finishing  his  studies  with  Messrs.  A.  &amp;:  W.  Robertson,  of  Montreal. 
He  was  admitted  to  practice,  January,  1847.  When  Judge  Short  died  in  1874,  Sir 
John  A.  Macdonald,  notwithstanding  some  political  differences,  at  once  raised  Mr. 
Sanborn  to  the  Bench  of  the  Superior  Court.  After  a  year,  the  Liberals,  being  in 
power,  transferred  him  to  the  Court  of  Queen's  Bench,  where  he  remained  to 
his  death.  He  died  July  17th,  1877.  So  well  liked  was  the  Judge  that,  at  his  funeral, 
no  less  than  six  judges  were  pall-bearers — Judges  Monk,  Badgley,  Rainville  (all 
since  deceased),  Doherty,  Johnson  (now  Sir  Francis  Johnson),  and  Berthelot. 

He  was  twice  married — first,  in  1847,  to  Eleanor  Hall  Brooks,  daughter  of 
Samuel  Brooks,  of  Sherbrooke,  who  died  in  1853  ;  the  second  time,  to  N.  Judson 
Hazeltine,  of  Bradford,  Mass.,  who  also  died  December,  1874.

teau,  of  the  same  place.  He  arrived  in  Montreal  at  the  age  of  twenty  years,  and 
began  the  business  of  a  grocer.  His  was  a  very  large  establishment  near  the  old 
eastern  boundary  of  Montreal.  He  prospered  in  this  undertaking.  In  1869,  he  was 
elected  to  the  City  Council,  to  represent  St.  Mary's  Ward,  and  also  was  re-elected 
by  acclamation  in  1872  as  Alderman  of  the  City  to  represent  the  same  Ward.  He 
was  a  great  promoter  to  extend  St.  Catherine  street  beyond  the  city  limits,  which 
was  accomplished  in  the  annexation  of  Hochelaga  to  Montreal,  and  this  street  is 
now  running  through  the  whole  of  that  new  adjunct  to  the  City.  He  was  once  Dir- 
ector of  several  Societies  for  the  developing  of  Montreal,  but  latterly  gave  up  his 
civic  duties  as  well  as  his  store,  and  has  directed  himself  to  the  profession  of 
Assignee  and  Accountant.  He  is  one  of  the  principal  Assignees  of  Montreal,  and

REV.  JAMES  HENRV  DIXON 

Was  born  in  Kildaie,  P.Q.,  on  the  20th  of  June,  1843.  ^'s  father,  Lieut.  John 
Dixon,  J.P.,  was  one  of  the  earliest  settlers  of  the  Township  of  Kildarc,  and  took 
an  active  part  in  church,  achool  and  municipal  matters.  His  paternal  grandfather 
belonged  to  an  old  English  family  which  furnished  several  soldiers  to  the  country, 
and  which  settled  in  Ireland  many  years  ago,  when  marriage  alliances  were  entered 
into  with  an  Irish  family.  Mr.  Dixon  was  early  destined  for  the  Church,  and  con- 
tinued his  studies  at  Berthier  and  Bishop's  College  Schools,  of  the  latter  of  which 
he  is  an  undergraduate.  lie  was  ordained  to  the  office  of  a  Deacon  by  the  Right 
Reverend  Dr.  Oxenden,  Bishop  of  Montreal,  in  the  year  1870,  and  to  the  office  of 
a  Priest  by  the  same  in  1871.  His  first  charge  was  the  Mission  of  Mille  Isles,  P.Q., 
where  he  is  still  kindly  remembered  by  the  people.  He  next  spent  four  years  in 
charge  of  Grenville,  P.Q.,  where  he  had  charge  of  a  district  now  ministered  to  by 
two  additional  clergymen.  In  1876,  Mr.  Dixon  was  inducted  into  the  charge  of  the 
Rectorate  of  St.  Jude's,  Montreal.  Mr.  Dixon  has  now  held  the  position  for  sixteen 
years,  during  which  time  he  lias  seen  the  church  property  increased  in  value  :ts  a 
result  and  blessing  upon  his  efforts  by  at  least  $28,000.  St.  Jude's  Church  has  now 
a  seating  capacity  of  nine  hundred  persons.  The  congregations  are  good,  and  the 
attendance  at  the  Sunday  School,  Band  of  Hope,  and  all  the  organizations  of  the 
church  large.  The  large  number  of  five  hundred  families  claim  St.  Jude's.  Since 
Mr.  Dixon's  incumbency,  there  have  been  changes  in  the  Rectorate  of  all  the  Churches 
of  England  in  the  city,  with  the  exception  of  St.  James  the  Apostle,  St.  John  the 
Evangelist's,  and  St.  Stephen's,  so  that  he  is  now  the  fourth  in  degree  of  seniority  of 
the  Rectors  of  this  city.  He  has  been  deeply  interested  in  Temperance,  and  held 
at  one  time  the  post  of  Secretary  of  the  Diocesan  Temperance  Society.  At  the  age 
of  twenty-one,  Mr.  Dixon  married  Miss  Frances  Jane  Connolly,  daughter  of  the  late 
James  Connolly,  Esq.,  of  Clarenceville,  P.Q.,  and  of  Margaret  Crawford  Adams. 
Of  the  issue  of  this  marriage,  five  children  still  live,  one  of  whom  is  Dr.  John  C. 
Dixon,  Dentist,  of  this  city,  a  young  man  destined  to  make  his  name  known  among 
the  Progressive  Dentists  of  the  day. 

LEWIS  JAMES  SEARGEANT 

Was  born  at  Trowbridge,  Wiltshire,  England,  and  came  first  to  America  in  1874. 
After  along  experience  of  railways  in  England,  heca  me  to  this  country.  He  had 
been  connected  with  several  of  the  largest,  amongst  them  the  South  Wales.  Upon 
its  amalgamation  with  the  Great  Western,  Mr.  Seargeant  was  handsomely  rewarded 
and  appointed  Superintendent  of  the  South  Wales  Division.  He  then  joined  the 
South  Division  fis  General  Manager  and  Secretary.  Being  offered  a  lucrative  appoint- 
ment in  India,  he  declined  at  the  request  of  the  North  Western  Company,  and  by 
doing  so  was  still  further  rewarded.     He  was  the  first  appointed  Traffic  Manager

on  any  railway  on  this  Continent,  and  we  are  happy  to  state  that  Mr.  Seargeant  has 
at  last  reached  the  goal  of  all  his  progression  and  advance,  being  now  the  General 
Manager  of  tiie  Grand  Trunk  Railway  of  Canada;  and  when  we  look  back,  as  the 
Author  can,  to  the  inception  and  progress  of  that  Railway — its  former  Managers, 
Messrs.  Blackwell  and  C.  J.  Brydges,  and  its  late  manager,  Sir  Joseph  Hickson,  and 
all  the  various  phases  it  has  passed  through,  wo  may  say  that  now  our  first  Grand 
(for  its  detractors  cannot  take  away  its  name)  Canadian  Railway  will  progress  more, 
and  in  the  twentietli  century  be  a  blessing  to  Canada. 

Mr.  Seargeant  is  a  man  of  rather  a  commanding  appearance,  well  cultured  and 
a  good  linguist — ([iialities  very  necessary  in  the  head  of  a  great  establishment  like 
the  Grand  Trunk.  Besides  these,  he  has  written  quite  considerably  on  many  subjects, 
such  as  the  "  Pool  Question,"  and  an  able  "  Review  on  the  English  Railway  System." 
Mr.  Seargeant  married  Elizabeth  Sedley  Barnes,  sister  of  the  well-known  physician 
of  London,  England,  Dr.  Robert  Barnes. 

HUGH  DAVID  LUMKDEN 

Was  born  at  Belchelvie  Lodge,  Aberdeenshire,  Scotland,  7th  September,  1844.  His 
father  was  the  late  Colonel  Lumsden,  C.B.,  and  his  mother,  Hay  Burnett.  The 
Lumsden  family  are  conspicuous  in  the  annals  of  Great  Britain.  He  was  educated  at 
Aberdeen,  and,  after  his  coming  to  Canada,  joined  the  volunteers.  He  was 
engineer  in  charge  of  the  Toronto  and  Nipissing  Railway,  also  of  the  Toronto,  Grey 
and  Bruce  Railway,  and  other  works  in  Ontario.  He  has  latterly  been  Engineer  to 
the  Canadian  Pacific  Railway.  Is  a  member  of  the  Institute  of  Civil  Engineers, 
England.  He  married,  October,  1885,  Mary  Frederica,  only  daughter  of  J.  W.  G. 
Whitney,  of  Toronto,  and  now  resides  in  Montreal. 

JOSEPH  VINCENT       « 

Was  born  at  Longueuil,  19th  March,  1835.  His  father  was  Antoine  Viiffcent,  and 
mother,  Melanie  Cere.  He  chose  mechanics  for  his  career,  and  after  some  years 
entered  into  the  opening  up  of  a  large  foundry  at  Longueuil.  After  Confederation, 
he  was  appointed  to  a  position  in  the  Inland  Revenue  at  Montreal,  August,  1867. 
He  passed  a  first-class  examination,  and,  in  1877,  was  promoted  to  the  Deputy  Col- 
lectorship.  When  the  position  of  Collector  became  vacant  in  1S79,  the  subject  of 
our  sketch  was  advanced  to  the  office,  and  never  was  appointment  made  better  than 
in  this  case,  "  the  right  man  in  the  right  place."  In  1880,  he  was  elected  Mayor  of 
the  Town  of  Longueuil ;  but  could  only  accept  the  honor  for  one  year,  having  to 
attend  to  his  Revenue  duties,  which  were  paramount  of  all  honors  and  distinctions. 
He  married,  November,  1858,  Philomene  Theroux,  and  he  had  the  large  family  of 
fifteen  children.  Mr.  Vincent  is  a  fine  example  of  a  self-made  man,  and  by  honesty 
and  push  has  raised  himself  to  the  position  which  he  now  enjoys.

SENATOR  ROLI-ANI) 

Was  l)()rii  at  V  ere  lit}  res,  2nd  January,  181 5.  His  father  was  Pierre  RoUand  and  his 
mother  was  Kuphrasine  Donais,  of  tlie  Parisli  of  Contrccceiir.  His  parents  removed, 
in  liis  early  childhood,  to  St.  Hyacinthe,  wliere  the  subject  of  this  sketcli  was  educated 
in  the  Parish  school.  (Jn  .\pril  ist,  iS^^2,  Mr.  Rolland  reached  Montreal  after  a  forty- 
five  miles  tramp  from  St.  Hyacinthe,  on  miserable  roads,  and  crossing  the  Richelieu 
River,  when  the  ice  was  loose  and  very  dangerous.  When  he  arrived  in  Montreal, 
he  knew  not  a  living  soul  in  the  jjlace,  and,  faint  and  weary,  he  applied  for  a  situation 
of  any  kind  or  for  information  what  to  do,  at  a  house  in  St.  Vincent  street,  the 
])roperty  which  lie  afterwards  bought,  and  which  is  now  tiie  well-known  house  of 
J.  J}.  Rolland  i\;  I'ils.  Not  h)ng  after  he  entered  the  office  of  La  Mincrve  as  an 
apprentice,  and  remained  there  till  he  became  of  age.  After  this  he  worked  as  a 
journeyman  for  four  years.  l&lt;'or  tlie  next  few  years  he  went  into  the  job  printing 
business  with  John  Thompson,  the  firm  being  then  called  Rolland  X:  Thompson. 
Since  1842,  to  his  death,  Mr.  Rolland  was  in  the  book  and  printing  business,  and  to 
help  the  cause  of  education  he  printed  several  school  books.  And  here  I  must 
state  that  no  man  was  more  anxious  to  edit  and  bring  out  the  work  of  provincial 
autiiors  than  the  late  Mr.  Rolland,  He  published  at  his  own  expense,  for  the  Author 
of  this  work,  his  Canadian  Geography — a  little  manual,  the  first  school  book  of  Can- 
adian Geography  published  after  the  Confederation.  It  was  well  received,  as  it 
si)oke  of  all  the  changes  which  the  new  Dominion  involved. 

During  years  past  Mr.  Rolland  let  his  sons,  associated  with  him  in  the 
business,  manage  the  ever-increasing  concern  of  their  huge  store.  He  devoted  him- 
self to  house  building,  of  which  many  now  can  testify  to  his  ambition  to  extend  the 
boundaries  of  his  adopted  city.  After  a  most  trying  and  energetic  life,  he  was  raised 
to  the  high  honor  of  being  nominated  one  of  the  Senators  of  Canada  ;  but  did  not  live 
long  to  enjoy  the  position.     He  died  universally  lamented  on  the  22nd  March,  1888. 

His  sons  are  tlie  sole  agents  for  the  Rolland  Paper  Company  of  St.  Jerome. 
This  immense  mill,  one  of  the  finest  in  Canada,  was  erected  to  supiily  a  great  demand 
for  home  paper,  and  ever  since  it  has  been  running  continuously  in  giving  to  Can- 
adians as  fine  a  commercial  paper  as  can  be  jjiocured  in  Canada.  This  house 
was  established  in  the  year  1842  by  their  father,  the  late  Senator  Rolland,  and  since 
that  date  has  prospered  in  a  marked  degree ;  the  energy  and  ability,  coupled  with 
the  intimate  knowledge  of  all  the  details  connected  with  the  trade  possessed  by  the 
partners  having  had  their  due  effect.  But  it  must  be  noticed  here  that,  especially  to 
Mr.  J.  B.  Rolland,  who  for  years  has  had  the  entire  management  of  the  works,  is 
due  much  of  its  prosperity  and  wonderful  growth.  He  is  here  the  right  man  in  the 
right  place.  The  mills  of  this  company  are  located  in  the  picturesque  village  of  St. 
Jerome,  and  are  among  the  best  of  their  kind  in  the  Dominic  n,  and  they  are  the 
only  manufacturers  in  Canada  of  tub-sized  and  loft  dried  papers,  linens,  book  papers, 
etc.  The  members  of  the  firm  are  well  and  favorably  known  in  commercial  circles 
in  Montreal  as  men  of  great  business  ability  and  foresight,  thoroughly  cognizant  of

all  that  pertains  to  their  trade,  and  always  interested  in  anything  that  goes  on  for  the 
benefit  of  the  city  and  its  commerce.  The  eldest  son,  Damien  Rolland,  has 
been  in  the  Council — first,  of  Hochelaga,  and  then  in  Montreal — latterly  as 
Chairman  of  the  important  Committee  of  Finance  for  the  long  period  of  twenty  years. 
He  is  one  of  the  best  known  of  our  Aldermen,  and  well  liked  by  the  English  portion. 
Having  lost  his  election  in  Hochelaga  lately,  through  the  influence  of  the  Labor 
League,  he  has  been  unanimously  elected  by  the  richest  and  most  influential  section 
of  the  city,  the  St.  Antoine  Ward,  to  take  the  place  of  Alderman  Shorey,  resigned. 
The  other  sons,  Octavien  Rolland  and  Damasien  Rolland,  are  also  associated  in  the 
immense  business  of  the  firm. 

HON.  HENRI  F.  RAINVUXE,  LL.H. 

The  late  Judge  was  brother  to  H.  B.  Rainville,  whose  sketch  is  found  at  page  151  of 
this  Gazetteer.  He  was  born  at  St.  Marie  de  Monnoir,  County  of  Rouville,  i6th 
December,  1839.  His  father  was  Jos.  Felix  Rainville  :  his  mother,  Marie  Louise 
Daigneau.  He  was  educated  at  St.  Hyacinthe  College.  Hi.s  legal  studies  were 
made  in  Laval,  of  which  Institution  he  was  LL.B.  After  his  studies,  he  was  admitted 
to  the  Bar  in  1862.  He  practised  in  Montreal  till  called  to  the  Bench  of  the  Superior 
Court  in  February,  1876,  occasioned  by  the  death  of  Mr.  Justice  J.  U.  Beaudry. 
Before  this,  he  had  been  Professor  of  Real  Estate  Law  in  McGill  University.  He 
married,  in  1867,  Helene  Herminie,  daughter  of  the  late  Gustave  Drolet,  of  Montreal. 
She  died  in  1872.  Judge  Rainville,  for  a  year  or  two  before  his  death,  did  not  enjoy 
good  health.  He  went  to  Paris  in  search  of  it,  after  being  retired  from  the  Bench, 
but  died  there  last  year.  He  was  a  man  of  clear  and  correct  judgment,  and  had  a 
keen  perception  of  all  points  of  Law. 

LOUIS  BOYER. 

He  was  born  in  Montreal,  30lh  November,  1793.  His  fixther  was  Frangois  Boyer, 
and  his  mother,  Josette  Boutone.  He  commenced  life  as  a  mason,  and  was  one  of 
the  contractors  of  the  Rideau  Canal,  also  of  the  Penitentiary  of  Kingston.  Attentive 
to  his  work  and  persevering  in  all  the  details  of  such  large  undertakings  as  the  above, 
with  many  others,  he  soon  acquired  a  fortune  of  over  a  million  dollars.  He  acquired 
immense  properties  of  land  near  Montreal  and  in  the  centre  of  the  village  of  Lachine 
and  other  places. 

On  14th  July,  1836,  he  married  Mile.  Aurelie  Mignault  de  St.  Denis.  She  was 
a  niece  of  the  well-known  Cure,  M.  Mignault.  He  had  three  sons  and  two  daughters. 
Two  short  sketches  of  two  of  the  sons  are  given  elsewhere.  His  daughters  were 
Madame  Auguste  Amor  and  Madame  Horace  Baby.  He  died  21st  December,  1870. 
He  had  been  one  of  the  Directors  of  La  Banque  Jacques  Carlier.  His  charitable 
character  is  seen  in  his  leaving  $4,000  in  perpetuity  to  give  bread  to  the  poor. 
He  was  an  intimate  friend  of  L.  J.  Papineau,  Sir  L.  Lafontaine,  A.  N.  Morin,  and 
other  well-known  names  in  Canadian  history.

GUSTAVE  ADOLPHE  DROLET,  Chkvalier, 

Was  born  at  St.  Pie,  County  of  Bagot,  February,  1844.  His  fiither  was  Charles 
Drolet,  of  that  place.  He  is  the  grandson  of  J.  'J".  Drolet,  the  Seigneur  of  the  large 
and  beautiful  Seigniory  of  St.  Marc,  and  who  played  an  important  part  in  1837,  and 
was  for  many  years  representative  to  the  House  of  Assembly  for  the  County  of  Ver- 
cheres. 

Mr.  Drolet  was  educated  in  the  College  of  St.  Hyacinthe  and  then  at  Terre- 
bonne (Masson  College).  He  studied  Law  at  St.  John  d'Ibeiville  with  the  Honorable 
C.  J.  Laberge,  and  was  admitted  to  the  practice  of  the  Law  in  1867.  He  then  enrolled 
as  one  of  the  Pontifical  Zouaves,  and  whilst  at  Rome  was  the  correspondent  of  the 
Minerve-  He  has  refused  several  times  to  be  a  member  of  either  the  Federal  or 
Local  Parliaments.  He  has  written  several  marked  articles  in  the  Canadian  Press, 
and  was  for  two  years  following,  the  President  of  the  "  L'Union  AUet." 

Mr.  Drolet  visited,  whilst  travelling  in  Europe  and  Asia,  among  other  places 
Athens,  Malta,  Paris,  Andros,  Smyrna,  Ephesus  and  Constantinople. 

He  and  his  co-partners,  Messrs.  Aldermen  David  and  Rivard,late  Mayor,  imbued 
with  a  desire  of  improving  the  northwest  section  of  the  city,  bought,  some  years  ago, 
the  farm  "  Comte,"  and,  in  one  year,  1874,  more  than  one  hundred  houses  were 
built  on  the  lots  which  were  sold  from  this  purchase.  They  also  built  in  Drolet 
street  a  number  of  cottages  (forty-five),  forming  a  beautiful  terrace  which  they  have 
named  "  Place  Comte  "  in  remembrance  of  the  original  proprietor.  These  houses 
were  just  the  kind  wanted  in  Montreal,  the  rents  averaging  from  $160  to  $200  per 
annum,  and  containing  all  improvements,  and  situated  in  one  of  the  pleasantest  and 
healthiest  places  in  the  city.  Every  one  who  thus  extends  and  builds  healthy  and 
agreeable  but  cheap  and  compact  houses  for  the  middle  classes,  is  indeed  benefiting 
the  city,  and  deserves  the  thanks  of  all  interested  for  the  good  work.  There  is 
perhaps  not  a  belter  spot  for  the  erection  of  houses  than  in  the  finely  located  ground 
above  Sherbrooke  street  cast.  The  view  is  here  magnificent,  stretching  away  down 
the  river  and  across  the  country,  bounded  by  the  blue  mountains  of  St.  Hilaire  or 
Beloeil  beyond.  Mr.  Drolet  resided  for  some  years  past  in  Paris,  but  he  returned 
to  Montreal,  where  he  now  lives. 

JOHN  McDOUGALL 

Was  one  of  the  self-made  and  prosperous  men  of  Montreal.  Proprietor  of  the 
Caledonia  Foundry.  He  is  a  native  of  Berwickshire,  Scotland,  and  was  born  in  1826. 
He  came  to  Canada  in  1832  with  his  parents,  and  received  an  ordinary  English 
education,  such  as  what  was  given  in  those  days.  He  started  the  Caledonia 
Foundry  in  1854,  and  from  a  small  beginning  the  establishment  now  covers  between 
three  and  four  acres  in  extent.  He  does  a  great  deal  of  work  for  the  different  lines 
of  railroad  coming  into  Montreal.  His  work  generally  is  heavy  machinery,  large 
steam  engines  and  boilers,  also  saw  and  grist  mills,  and  the  complicated  machinery 
used  in   sugar  manufactories.     Mr.  McDougall  has  ever  borne  the  name  of  being  a 


444  GAZETTEER  OF  MONTREAL. 

generous  and  straightforward  gentleman.  Knowing  the  advantage  of  first-class  educa- 
tion, he  has  given  his  children  the  advantages  of  the  best  institutions  both  in  and  out 
of  Montreal.  What  he  has  accumulated  has  been  by  his  own  innate  industry, 
which  like  virtue  always  brings  its  own  reward. 

HON.  D.  U.  VIGER 

Was  born  ir  Montreal,  August  19,  1774.  After  having  completed  his  studies,  he 
entered  the  office  of  L.  C.  Foucher,  Parliamentary  Representative  for  Montreal  and 
Solicitor  (leneral.  His  first  writings  were  in  the  Gazette  of  Montreal.  In  this  cor- 
respondence Mr.  Viger  vigorously  defended  the  citizens.  He  was  only  eighteen 
years  old  at  the  time.  He  then  went  to  Quebec  to  complete  his  studies  under  J.  A. 
Panet,  and  was  admitted  to  the  Bar,  March  9,  1799.  All  at  once  a  popular  star 
arose  for  the  advantage  of  the  French  Canadians,  and  he  so  advocated  their  just 
rights  that  he  was  elected  to  represent  the  East  Division  of  Montreal  in  1808.  The 
same  year  his  cousin,  L.  J.  Papineau,  was  elected  for  the  County  of  Kent,  now  no 
more  seen  on  the  map  of  Canada.  Let  me  now  quote  what  I  received  seventeen 
years  ago  regarding  this  election.  It  says,  speaking  of  these  two  great  names  : 
"  C'^taient  deux  nobles  intelligences  qui  se  levaient  ensemble  a  I'horison  de  la 
patrie.  C'etaient  deux  mains  puissantes  qui  venaient  au  secours  de  la  liberte 
menacee."  In  the  administration  of  Governor  Craig  he  was  incarcerated,  but 
released  in  1810.  He  represented  then  the  County  of  Leincesler,  now  wiped  out 
from  Canadian  Geography.  He  then  represented  the  County  of  Kent  from  18 16  to 
1830.  Such  a  length  of  service  that  we  may  calculate  on  the  results  of  his  Parlia- 
mentary career  in  the  twenty  years  his  constituents  reposed  confidence  in  him. 

In  1828,  Mr.  Viger  chose  Mr.  Neilson  and  Mr.  Cuvillier  to  go  to  England, 
carrying  with  them  the  historical  address  of  the  Canadian  people  to  the  Throne  of 
Britain,  and  exposing  the  grievances  of  the  administration  of  the  Governor  Dalhousie. 
This  wonderful  petition  had  80,000  signatures  of  the  Canadian  people,  a  vast  num- 
ber, considering  all  things  and  the  census  of  the  people  at  that  time.  It  resulted,  as 
we  all  know,  in  the  recall  of  Lord  Dalhousie,  and  the  granting  of  favorable  terms  to 
the  Parliament  of  Lower  Canada.  Mr.  Viger  was  raised  to  the  Higher  Court  of 
Parliament  by  Governor  Sir  James  Kempt.  He  took  part  in  the  troubles  of  1837-38, 
and  was  thrown  into  prison.  His  papers  were  confiscated,  and  he  was  subjected  to 
every  indignity. 

He  had  an  eventf"!  life  during  the  times  of  1837-38,  and  on  till  1850,  ever  fore- 
most in  advancing  the  interests  of  his  native  country. 

D.  B.  Viger  stands  out  prominently  as  the  Father  of  the  Canadian  Press  of 
Montreal,  He  founded  the  Spectator,  he  was  connected  with  Minerve  and  the 
VAurore  des  Canadas.  He  much  aided  the  efforts  of  Ludger  Duvernay,  who  was  then 
the  proprietor  of  the  Minerve.  He  was  one  of  the  founders  of  rOrdre,  and  encour- 
aged the  publication  of  t Echo  of  \.\\q.  Cabinet  de  Lecture. 

Full  of  Christian  generosity  and  Catholic  Christianity,  he  died  in  1861  at  the 
advanced  age  of  eighty-six  years  and  six  months.  We  may  well  say  in  the  words  of  a 
contemporary  historian  :  ''  Sa  mort  a  6te  celle  d'un  vrai  Chretien."  Requiescat  in  pace.

EDWARD  A.  ST.  GEORGE  HUGHES 

Was  born  July  5,  r847,  ^^  St.  Ther^se.  His  fixther  was  Henry  B.  Hughes,  Advocate 
and  Clerk  of  the  Peace,  and  his  mother's  name  was  Eliza  Dumoulin.  He  was  edii-* 
cated  at  Nicolet  College,  and  admitted  as  a  Notary  in  187?,  and  called  to  the  Bar 
of  Lower  Canada  in  January,  1881.  He  first  practised  in  partnership  with  Hon.  J. 
A.  Ouimet,  now  one  of  the  Privy  Council  of  the  Dominion  of  Canada.  For  two  years 
he  was  Deputy  Clerk  of  the  Peace  and  the  Clerk  for  Licences  for  the  City  of  Mon- 
treal. He  resigned  these  appointments  to  become  Brigade-Major  for  No.  6  Military 
District.  He  received  a  first-class  certificate  at  the  Military  School  of  Quebec,  be- 
came then  Major  of  the  65th  Battalion  in  1880,  and  in  being  appointed  Brigade- 
Major  was  made  a  Brevet  Lieut. -Colonel. 

When  the  North-West  Rebellion  broke  out,  he  waved  his  rank  of  Lieut. - 
Colonel,  and  went  as  major  of  his  old  corps  to  the  front,  which  he  commanded  at 
the  engagements  of  Frenchmen's  Cut,  May  28,  1885.  He  was  recommended  by 
General  Middleton  to  be  a  full  Colonel  for  his  actions  then.  He  was  appointed 
Chief  of  Police  for  the  City  of  Montreal,  April  17,  1888.  When  he  took  the  reins  of 
this  most  important  office  of  the  city  in  hand,  there  were  228  men  of  all  ranks  in  the 
strength  of  the  Police  Force,  now  by  his  exertions  he  has  had  it  raised  to  the  num- 
ber of  320  with  three  new  stations.  He  has  also  got  the  pay  of  the  men  increased  25 
per  cent,  and  has  thoroughly  reorganized  the  whole  staff  and  departments.  He  is 
now  engaged  on  an  important  book  on  ilie  duties  of  the  constabulary.  He  was  the 
mainspring  in  preparing  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Benefit  Fund  now  in  exist- 
ence in  the  Force. 

His  greatgrandfather  was  a  Caleb  Hughes,  who  arrived  in  Montreal  in  1825, 
and  who  was  transferred  to  what  was  then  known  as  the  Canadian  Fesicibles,  for  the 
Chief  has  come  of  an  old  fighting  military  family.  His  grandfather  was  in  tiie  Eng- 
lish army,  the  78th  Highlanders,  and  his  uncle  Cartright  died  at  Lacolle  in  the  War 
ofi8i2.  The  Chief  is  a  fine  specimen  of  the  old  family,  and  to  him  can  truly  be 
applied  the  nautical  saying,  he  is  "  a  chip  of  the  old  block." 

REV.  FATHER  QUINi.IVAN. 

The  vacant  pastorate  of  St.  Patrick's  Church  has  been  filled,  and  filled  by  an  appoint- 
ment that  seems  most  natural,  and  one  that  will  doubtless  be  very  welcome  to  the 
parishioners  of  that  Church.  The  successor  of  the  late  Father  Dowd  is  the  priest 
who  for  a  number  of  years  has  been  connected  with  that  Church  as  assistant,  the 
Rev.  Father  John  Quinlivan.  It  is  a  name  well  known  to  the  Irish  Roman  Catholics 
of  Montreal,  and  the  reverend  gentleman  is  recognized  by  all  as  a  worthy  successor 
to  the  important  charge  left  vacant  by  the  death  of  Father  Dowd.  Rev.  John  Quinli- 
van is  an  Upper  Canadian  by  birth,  and  his  youth  was  spent  in  that  Province  where 
he  received  his  early  education.  He  pursued  his  classical  studies  in  the  School  of 
the  Basilian  Fathers,  Toronto,  which  is  a  branch  College  of  the  Mother  House  of  the 
Fathers  of  St.  Basil,  an   order  established  more  than   half  a  century  ago  at  Lyons,

France.  He  graduated  with  high  honors  and  then  came  to  Montreal  and  entered 
the  Department  of  Philosophy  of  the  Seminary  of  St.  Sulpice.  After  completing  his 
studies  there,  he  pursued  for  four  years  his  theological  studies  in  the  Grand  Seminary 
and  then  went  to  Paris  and  entered  the  Seminary  of  St.  Sulpice  there,  but  poor 
health  compelled  him  to  return  to  Montreal.  Shortly  after  his  return  he  was  or- 
dained by  Archbishop  Fabre,  and  became  one  of  the  Professors  at  the  Grand  Semi- 
nary on  Sherbrooke  street.  His  i)rincipal  pastoral  work  has  been  in  connection  with 
St.  Patrick's  Church  over  which  he  is  now  called  to  preside  as  Parish  Priest.  For 
several  years  he  was  Father  Dowd'i;  principal  assistant,  ?nd  was  entrusted  with  a 
large  portion  of  the  administration  of  tiie  finances  of  the  parish.  It  was  in  a  measure 
owing  to  his  thorough  knowledge  of  the  parish  work  and  its  interests  that  he  has 
received  his  present  im|)ortant  position.  In  speaking  of  Father  Quinlivan,  one  of 
his  fellow-priests  said  :  "  He  is  a  thoroughly  educated  gentleman  of  a  rather  retiring 
disposition.  He  is  a  close  student,  an  indefatigable  worker  and  an  easy  but  convincing 
speaker.  He  is  a  man  worthy  of  the  greatest  confidence."  He  fully  appreciated  the 
sterling  qualities  of  his  predecessor,  and,  no  doubt,  he  will  walk  closely  in  his  foot- 
steps, and  thus  secure  a  continuation  o{  the  prosperous  state  in  which  Father  Dowd 
left  the  parish.  Rev.  Father  Quinlivan  is  a  man  about  forty-six  years  of  age.  He 
is  still  in  his  prime,  and,  no  doubt,  many  years  of  great  usefulness  are  before  him  in 
the  broad  field  of  labor  which  the  parish  of  St.  Patrick's  opens  before  him. 

T.  A.  LABADIE,  N.P., 

Was  born  in  Montreal,  June  5,  1805.  His  father  was  Joseph  Labadie,  and  his 
mother,  Marie  Francome  Desautels.  When  he  was  only  seven  years  of  age  he 
entered  the  College  of  Montreal.  After  two  years  he  went  for  five  years  to  the  Col- 
lege of  St.  Thomas  at  Vercheres,  under  the  direction  of  Rev.  Messire  T.  Kimber  and 
his  uncle,  Mr.  Louis  G.  Labadie.  In  1819,  at  fourteen,  he  returned  to  Montreal.  His 
parents  wanted  to  make  him  a  merchant  and  placed  him  in  the  care  of  the  well-known 
Austin  Cuvillier,  where  he  remained  about  two  months.  His  desire  being  seen  that 
he  wished  to  be  a  notary,  he  was  placed  in  the  charge  of  J.  M.  Cadieux,  a  very  dis- 
tinguished notary  of  the  city  at  that  time,  where  he  remained  till  he  was  nineteen 
years  old  and  had  completed  his  curriculum.  As  he  could  not  be,  for  his  youth, 
admitted  to  the  profession  for  two  years,  Mr.  Cadieux  gave  him  full  charge  of  the 
office,  in  which  he  continued  till  June  25,  1826,  wlien  he  was  admitted  to  practice 
the  profession  of  a  notary  on  his  own  account.  He  then  went  for  a  year  to  prac- 
tice at  Laprairie  with  Pierre  Lanctot,  but  was  requested  by  quite  a  number  of  clients 
to  come  back  to  Montreal,  which  he  did  in  1827.  His  office  was  where  the  Banque 
du  Peuple  now  siands.  During  his  life  he  was  President  of  the  old  Chamber  of 
Notaries  of  Montreal ;  also  of  the  first  Provincial  Chamber.  In  1837,  he  was  arrested 
as  a  political  prisoner.  Arrested  in  November,  1838,  at  the  same  time  as  Hon.  Sir 
L.  H.  Lafontaine,  Hon.  D,  B.  Viger  and  many  others,  he  was  detained  in  gaol 
for  thirty-five  days,  and  at  last  liberated  on  giving  bail.      He  was  also  a  Magis-

tratc  and  Commissioner  and  a  Lieut-Colonel  in  the  Militia,  Thj  I,abadic 
family  have  been  notaries  for  generations.  His  son  is  a  well-known  notary  of 
Montreal,  J.  E.  O.  Labradie,  one  of  the  best  and  most  reliable  in  the  i)rofcssion, 
and  the  grandsons  of  this  sketch  are  also  notaries  practicing  in  Montreal — J.  K. 
O.  Labadie,  jiin.,  and  A.  Labadie.  Just  before  the  death  of  the  grandfiither,  a 
few  years  ago,  there  were  three  generations  of  notaries  all  seen  practicing  in  the 
same  office  near  St.  Lambert  Hill — a  very  rare  thing  and  an  occurrence  happen- 
ing seldom  in  a  century,  No  family  has  more  identified  themselves  with  the 
City  of  Montreal  in  its  advance  and  development  than  that  of  the  family  of 
Labadie.  It  is  an  essential  thing  in  real  estate  to  have  a  notary  fit  and  com- 
])etent  to  execute  deeds  and  transfers,  to  wr'te  wills  and  last  testaments;  and  in 
all  this  the  Labadie  family  is  excelled  by  none. 

BISHOP  OXENDEN. 

London,  February  23rd,  1892.  —  "Bishop  Oxenden,  late  Bishop  of  Mo  real  and 
Metropolitan  of  the  Anglican  Church  in  Canada,  died  in  Biarritz  yesterday."  Such 
was  the  cablegram  which  arrived  in  Montreal  a  few  days  ago. 

"  The  deceased  was  born  at  Broome  Park,  near  Canterbury,  in  1808,  and  finished 
his  studies  at  University  College,  Oxford,  taking  his  B.A.  in  1831.  Some  three  years 
afterwards  he  was  ordained  Priest  of  the  Anglican  Church.  He  entered  upon  his 
ministry  with  zeal  and  energy.  From  1848  to  1869  he  was  the  much-esteemed  Rector 
of  Puckley-with-Pemington  in  the  beautiful  County  of  Kent.  His  ministrations  here 
won  for  him  the  love  and  respect  of  not  only  his  own  parishioners,  but  also  those 
who  differed  from  the  Established  Church.  In  1864,  he  was  made  an  Honorary 
Canon  of  Canterbury  Catlicdral, . 

"  The  late  Bishop  l*ulford,  the  first  Metropolitan  and  Primate  of  Canada,  having 
died  in  the  year  1869,  the  Anglican  Synod  of  Canada  after  much  deliberation  chose 
The  Rev.  Ashton  Oxenden,  of  England,  as  his  successor.  Bishop  Oxenden  was 
thereupon  consecrated  by  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury  and  other  Anglican 
Bishops  in  Canterbury  Cathedral  with  great  ceremony.  On  his  arrival  in  Canada 
he  energetically  set  to  work  to  carry  out  the  large  and  broad  ideas  of  his  predecessor, 
in  the  developement  and  extension  of  the  Anglican  Church  throughout  the  whole 
Dominion.  Never  very  strong,  his  physical  powers  soon  gave  way  under  the  great 
strain  of  his  labors.  The  climate  was  also  found  to  be,  in  winter,  too  much  for  his 
delicate  constitution,  so  that  he  was  compelled,  though  reluctantly,  after  serving  less 
than  ten  years  as  Metropolitan  to  offer  his  resignation  of  his  See,  finding  the  fatigues 
of  the  large  diocese  beyond  his  then  failing  strength.  As  the  country  at  this  time 
was  beginning  to  fill  up  with  a  large  class  of  emigrants  from  England,  the  majority 
of  whom  were  of  the  Anglican  faith,  the  labors  of  the  Metropolitan  were  increased 
in  seeing  after  the  interest  of  the  Church  in  this  region.  Bishop  Oxenden,  therefore, 
resigned  in  April,  1878,  and  returned  to  England.  In  May,  1879,  he  was  instituted 
to  the  vicarage  of  St.  Stephen,  near  Canterbury,  where  he  has  ministered  up  to  the 
time  of  his  demise."

R.  J.  DEVINS. 

The  late  Mr.  Devins  had  been  connected  with  the  drug  business  of  this  city  most  his  of 
life,  and  was  one  of  its  leading  members.  At  one  time  he  was  the  senior  member  of 
the  firm  of  Messrs.  Devins  &amp;  Bolton,  a  well-known  firm  next  the  Court  House,  Notre 
Dame  street.  They  were  in  business  together  in  this  stand  for  about  ten  years,  sub- 
sequent to  which  he  continued  it  alone  until  about  two  years  ago,  when  he  gave  up 
the  retail  business  and  confined  himself  to  the  manufacture  of  specialties.  The 
deceased  was  a  widower,  and  had  been  boarding  at  the  Grey  Nunery,  where  he  has 
a  sister — Sister  Devins,  one  of  the  best  known  and  highest  ladies  of  this  great  estab- 
lishment. 

DR.  DUGDALE. 

"  J.  J.  DuGDALE  was  a  native  of  Ireland.  He  was  born  at  Claragara  on  Lake  Garadise, 
in  the  County  of  Leitrini,  in  the  year  1834.  Early  in  the  fifties  the  family  emigrated 
to  Canada  and  settled  in  the  City  of  Kingston.  Dr.  Dugdale  was  favored  with  the 
early  advantage  of  a  superior  education.  For  a  time  he  was  engaged  in  commercial 
life.  Determining  in  favor  of  the  medical  profession,  he  entered  the  Queen's  Uni- 
versity, and  in  1866  graduated  in  Medicine.  Soon  after  he  established  himself  in 
Montreal,  and  for  the  last  twenty-five  years  he  has  been  practising  his  profession 
here  with  ever-widening  influence.  For  some  years,  in  the  early  period  of  his  pro- 
fessional life,  Dr.  Dugdale  held  the  position  of  medical  officer  of  health  for  Montreal. 
His  fidelity  in  this  department  of  duty  was  beyond  all  praise,  doubtless  saving  thou- 
sands of  lives  by  his  vigorous  enforcement  of  sanitary  regulations  at  a  period  when 
but  little  attention  was  paid  to  the  perils  of  zymotic  diseases." 

In  his  death  Montreal  has  lost  one  of  his  most  worthy,  benevolent  and,  accord- 
ing to  his  means,  generous  citizens.  He  was  intimately  associated  with  the  Dominion 
Square  Methodist  Church  as  a  trustee,  class  leader  and  Sunday-school  teacher.  For 
some  years  he  had  been  in  failing  health,  and  his  intimate  friends  feared  that  his 
career  might  close  at  any  time. 

His  fatal  illness  developed  on  December  nth,  1891,  the  evening  following  an 
address  on  the  effects  of  alcohol  on  the  stomach,  at  a  Royal  Templars'  entertainment 
at  the  Assembly  Rooms, Queen's  Hall,  he  being  a  member  of  that  order,  and  he  died 
a  few  days  ago. 

WILLIAM   STEWART. 

This  name  figures  in  the  annals  of  Old  Montreal.  He  must  have  come  to  the  city 
about  the  time  of  the  American  war  of  Independence.  He  was  a  native  of  Glasgow, 
Scotland.  He  died  December,  17S7,  at  sixty-four  years  of  age.  He  left  a  widow 
named  Isabella  Cowan,  who  afterwards  married  Mr.  William  Hunter.  One  of  the 
daughters  of  this  marriage  afterwards  became  the  wife  of  the  late  Sheriff  Boston,  and 
was  married  to  him  in  1814.     She  died  in  1821.

MR.  JUSTICE  WURTELE 

Was  born  at  (Quebec,  27th  January,  1828.  His  fatlier  was  Jonathan  Wurtelc, 
Seignior  of  River  David,  and  his  mother  Louisa  Sojiliia  Campbell,  of  a  family  well 
known  in  Quebec.  His  paternal  ancestors  came  from  Strumfeibagh,  a  village  in 
Wurtemburg,  distant  a  few  miles  from  Stuttgart,  and  they  can  be  traced  up  in 
the  churcii  records  to  1559.  When  he  was  an  infant  his  father  removed  his  family 
to  River  David,  in  the  County  of  Yamaska,  where  he  spent  his  youth.  He  was 
educated  partly  at  the  Quebec  Classical  School  and  High  School,  which  was  then 
conducted  by  tiie  Rev.  Francis  Lundy,  D.C.L.,  afterwards  Principal  of  McGill  Col- 
lege, and  partly  at  home  by  a  private  tutor,  Frederick  B.  Calvert,  li.A.,  Aberdeen. 
He  owes  his  French  education  to  Mr.  Labonte,  the  then  worthy  Schoolmaster  of 
River  David.  He  studied  Law  at  Quebec  under  the  Hon.  Jean  Chabol,  M.P.P. 
for  Quebec,  and  afterwards  a  Judge  of  the  Superior  Court,  and  was  called  to  the 
Bar  of  Lower  Canada  on  the  6th  of  August,  1850.  Shortly  after  he  was  offered  a 
partnership  by  Henry  Judah,  (^.C,  and  practised  with  him  at  Montreal  until  1852, 
when  the  Trust  and  Loan  Company  of  Canada  agreed  to  advance  $400,000  to  the 
sufferers  by  the  great  fire,  and  Mr.  Judah  was  appointed  the  Solicitor  and  Mr. 
Wurtele  the  Agent  of  the  Company.  He  remained  in  this  office  until  1856,  when 
family  affairs  compelled  him  to  remove  to  River  David,  where  he  resided  until  1862. 
During  his  residence  at  Rivor  David  he  was  Mayor  of  the  Parish,  President  of  the 
School  Commission,  a  Justice  of  the  Peace  and  Commissioner  of  the  court  of  small 
causes.  He  returned  to  Montreal  in  1862,  and  was  employed  as  Chief  Clerk  of  the 
Seigniorial  Commission,  of  which  Henry  Judah,  ( ).C.,  was  the  Chief  Commissioner, 
until  1866.  He  was  then  associated  by  the  Hon.  J.  J.  C.  Abbott,  Q.C.,  in  his  firm, 
and  practised  with  him  until  1868,  when  he  formed  a  partnership  with  Frederick 
T.  Judah,  Q.C.,  with  whom  he  practised  until  1878.  He  was  himself  appointed 
Queen's  Counsel,  28th  January,  1873.  In  1878  he  formed  a  partnership  with  Desire 
Girouard,  Q.C.,  and  practised  with  him  until  1883. 

Mr.  Wurtele  was  appointed  a  Lecturer  on  Commercial  Law  in  McGill  Univer- 
sity in  1867,  and  received  the  degree  of  B.C. L.  in  1870;  m  1871,  he  was  appointed 
Associate  Professor  of  Commercial  Law  with  the  Hon.  J.  J.  C.  Abbott,  Q.C.»  whose 
professional  engagements  interfered  with  his  lectures.  In  1882  he  received  the  degree 
of  D.C.L.,  and  he  afterwards  resigned  his  professorship  owning  to  his  political 
engagements,  but  on  the  reorganization  of  the  faculty  of  Law,  he  accepted  the  chair 
of  the  Law  of  Real  Estate, 

At  the  time  of  the  agitation  for  the  abolition  of  the  .Seigniorial  tenure  Mr. 
Wurtele  was  appointed  Secretary  of  the  Association  of  Seigniors  formed  for  co-oper- 
ation to  secure  a  fair  indemnity,  and  he  acted  with  Louis  J.  A.  Papineau  and  the  late 
Col.  T.  E.  Campbell,  C.B.,  and  the  late  Hon.  John  Pangman,  as  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee of  the  Association.  They  employed  as  Counsel  on  behalf  of  the  Seigniors 
before  the  Legislature.  Mr.  Justice  Dunkin  and  Mr.  Justice  Ramsay,  and  through 
the  efforts  of  these  gentlemen  and  their  own  exertions,  the  Bill  before  the  Legislature 
to  wiiich  they  took  exception  was  modified,  and  the  Seigniorial  Act  of  1854,  which  did

justice  to  both  Seigniors  and  Censitaires,  was  passed.  Subsequently  tliey  retainrd 
and  secured  the  services  of  the  two  al)ove-namcd  gentlemen,  together  with  C.  S. 
Cherrier,  ().C.,  and  ^^r.  Justice  McKay,  as  Counsel  for  the  Seigniors  before  ihc 
Seigniorial  C'ourt.  Mr.  \Vurtclc  is  tlie  last  Lower  Canadian  Seignior  who  ren- 
dered fealty  and  homage  ;  having  done  so  on  the  3rd  February,  1S54,  between 
the  hands  of  His  Excellency  Lieut, -General  Rowan,  Administrator  of  the  Govern- 
ment, and  his  act  closes  the  register  of  fealty  and  homage  for  Lower  Canada. 

Mr.  Wiirtele  represented  for  many  years  the  ('ounty  of  Yaniaska  in  the  Legis- 
lative Assembly  of  Quebec.  He  was  first  elected  in  1875;  then  in  1878,  after  the 
dismissal  of  the  DeBoucherville  Ministry  ;  then  in  18S1,  and  the  last  time  by  acclama- 
tion on  his  appointment  as  Provincial  Treasurer  in  1882.  He  apijlied  himself  prin- 
cipally to  the  work  of  legislation,  and  carried  through  many  important  amendments 
to  our  laws,  and  he  was  for  several  sessions  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Private 
Bills,  and  also  Chairman  of  the  Select  Committee  on  the  Municipal  Code. 

Li  1880,  he  was  sent  to  France  by  the  Chapleau  Ministry  to  negotiate  a  loan  of 
$4,000,000,  which  was  required  to  continue  the  construction  of  the  Railway  on  the 
North  Shore  from  Quebec  to  Ottawa,  and  completed  the  negotiation  and  returned  to 
Qiiebec  in  forty  days.  After  the  loan  was  voted  by  the  Legislature  he  returned  to 
France  to  complete  it,  and  at  the  same  lime  he  organized  the  Credit  Foncier  Franco- 
Canadien,  which  had  considerable  influence  in  effecting  a  reduction  in  the  rate 
of  interest  on  loans  on  real  estate,  and  introduced  the  system  of  rei;ayment  by 
amortization,  and  has  been  a  success,  having  now  loans  on  real  estate  lor  over 
$6,500,000.  As  a  recognition  of  his  services  in  affording  a  new  field  for  the  invest- 
ment of  French  capital,  he  was  made  an  officer  of  Public  Instruction  in  i88o,  and 
was  awarded  the  Cross  of  an  Officer  of  the  Legion  of  Honor  in  1882.  He  filled  the 
office  of  Provincial  Treasurer  during  the  years  1882  and  1883,  and  imposed  the  tax 
on  commercial  corporations,  of  which  the  constitutionality  was  contested  both  in  the 
Legislative  Assembly  and  in  the  Court,  but  was  finally  acknowledged  by  the  Privy 
Council.  In  1884,  he  was  named  Speaker  of  the  Legislative  Assembly,  and  occupied 
the  Chair  until  June,  1886.  He  rendered  many  decisions  on  questions  of  order  and 
on  constitutional  questions  which  are  referred  to  as  authority.  During  his  term  of 
office  as  Speaker  he  prepared  a  Manual  of  Parliamentary  Procedure  whicii  has  been 
adopted  for  the  use  of  the  Assembly.  He  was  raised  to  the  Bench  of  the  Superior 
Court  for  Lower  Canada  on  the  28th  June,  1886,  and  was  first  assigned  to  the  District 
of  Ottawa,  where  he  remained  until  November,  1888.  His  removal  was  much  regret- 
ted by  the  inhabitants  of  the  district,  and  their  feelings  were  expressed  by  resolu- 
tions of  the  Council  of  the  Counties  of  Ottawa  and  Pontiac.  He  wao  removed  to 
Montreal,  and  in  September,  1891,  was  appointed  an  Assistant  Judge  of  the  Court 
of  Queen's  Bench,  in  which  he  now  sits.  He  has  earned  and  holds  a  high  position 
in  judicial  circles. 

Mr.  Wurtele  was  married  twice  :  the  first  time  on  the  7  th  January,  1854,  to 
Julia  Nelson,  daughter  of  the  late  Dr.  Wolfred  Nelson  ;  and  the  second  time  on  the 
ist  of  June,  1875,  to  Sarah  Braniff,  daughter  of  the  late  Thomas  Braniff"  of  New- 
Brighton,  Staten  Island,  N.  Y.

\'et,  after  having  ciiarged  the  Jury,  as  in  more  than  one  case  in  the  memory  of  the 
Author,  clear  and  against  the  prisoner,  that  "August  Hody  "  going  diametrically 
opposite  to  the  learned  Judge's  charge,  he  must  then  have  felt  the  glorious  uncertainty 
of  the  J,aw.  The  late  Judge  Ramsay  was  a  writer  of  no  mean  repute.  He  is  the 
Author  of  the  "  Digested  Index  to  the  Reported  Cases  in  Lower  Canada,'  1865,  and 
before  that  time  of  the  "  Law  Reporter  or  Journal  of  Jurisprudence,"  1S54.  Tiiese 
works  were,  as  they  have  been,  destined  to  render  immense  service  to  the  Advocates 
of  the  Province  of  Quebec.  In  1863,  he  published  a  work  of  great  importance.  It 
was  called  '"  Notes  on  the  Law  of  Paris."  The  result  of  this  publication  was  in  the 
abrogation  of  no  less  than  one  hundred  and  forty-eight  articles  affecting  the  legisla- 
tion of  tile  Province  in  the  old  Statutes.  After  a  busy  and  eventful  life  he  died  a  few 
years  ago,  full  of  honors  and  respect. 

ALEXANDER  JOHN.SON,  LL.D. 

No  man  stands  higher  in  Science  and  Literature  than  he  who  occupies  this  sketch. 
McGill  University  may  be  proud  of  such  a  man  as  the  Dean  of  the  Faculty  of  Arts. 
His  past  career  has  been  one  of  wonderful  progress,  and  we  well  remember,  when  as 
a  very  young  man  he  made  his  debut  in  McGill,  how  much  was  said  of  his  mathe- 
matical lore  and  reasoning  powers.  His  honor  list  is  as  follows  :  he  is  an  M.A.  and 
LT^.D.  of  Dublin,  honorary  D.C.L.  of  the  University  of  Bishop's  College,  Lennox- 
ville,  and  a  Fellow  of  the  Royal  Canadian  Society.  He  is  Senior  Moderator  (Cold 
Medalist)  in  ^fathematics  and  Physics  in  Dublin  University,  and  formerly  Classical 
Scholar  in  Trinity  College  there.  He  is  now  Professor  of  Mathematics  and  Natural 
Philosophy  in  McGill  University,  and  Dean  of  the  Faculty  of  Arts  and  Vice-Principal 
of  that  Institution.  He  was  one  of  the  original  members  of  the  Royal  Society  of 
Canada,  and  has  been  President  of  Section  HI  (Mathematics  and  Physics  and 
Chemistry).  Dr.  Johnson  has  contributed  Mathematical  and  Physical  Papers  to 
its  Transactions,  e.g.  ''A  Symmetrical  Investigation  of  the  Curvature  of  Surfaces," 
and  "  Tidal  Observations  in  Canadian  Waters." 

In  1884,  when  the  British  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Science  met  in 
Montreal,  he  procured  the  appointment  of  a  Committee  of  the  Association  on  the 
subject  of  Tidal  Observations,  of  which  he  was  made  Chairman  and  Secretary.  Sir 
William  Thomson,  Professor  J.  Couch  Adams  (the  discoverer  of  Neptune),  and 
Professor  George  Darwin  were  appointed  a  Corresponding  Committee  in  England. 
The  direct  object  of  the  Committee  was  to  persuade  the  Dominion  Government  to 
undertake  systematic  Tidal  Observations  that  would  tend  to  lessen   the    dangers

of  iKivigalion  in  Canadian  waters.  Iiuliicctly  llic  results  would  benefit  Science. 
The  Cominillee  collectetl  the  evidence  of  Scientific  men,  and  of  Shii)inasters  and 
others;  was  supported  l)y  the  different  Hoards  of  Trade  of  the  Dominion,  more  espe- 
cially by  the  Hoard  of  'I'rade  of  Montreal,  by  petitions  from  the  masters  and  officers 
of  shijjs,  and  by  the  Koyal  Society  of  Canada.  After  six  years'  work  (being  re- 
aj)pointi'd  year  after  year  at  the  annual  meeting  of  the  Hritish  .\ssociatioii,  (Ireat 
Jiritain),  it  was  at  length  successful.  The  greater  part  of  the  woik  necessarily 
devolved  on  the  Chairman.  The  'I'idal  Observations  are  now  being  proceeded  with, 
and  it  is  expected  that  their  results  will  be  very  beneficial  to  navigation,  as  well  of 
scientific  value. 

HON.  DOMINKJUK  MONDEI-KT 

Was  a  member  of  the  Special  Council  in  1S38,  then  elected  to  the  high  office  of 
Judge  of  the  Superior  Court  for  the  District  of  Three  Rivers.  He  was  born  in 
Montreal,  and  died  in  Three  Rivers  in  1863.  He  published  in  1S35  a  book  called 
'•  Traite  sur  la  politicjue  coloniale  du  Has  Canada." 

I'ON.  J.  A.  JUCRTllIil.OT 

Was  born  May  S.  1S15,  at  St.  Kustache.     His   father  was  Jos.  Amable   Berlhelot. 

Notary,  and  his  mother  Danie  Marie  M.  Hervieux.     The  Judge  was  only  nine  years 

old  when  he  began  his  Latin  course,  and  he  continued  it  to   1832,  the  curriculum 

suddenly  terminating  on  account  of  Cholera  which  visited  the  country  that  year.    He 

studied  Law  with  Sir  L.  H.  Lafontaine,  and  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  in  November, 

1836.     In  partnership  with   Mr.  Lafontaine  the  firm  practised  till  1853,  when  Mr. 

Lafontaine  was  api)ointed  Chief-Justice  for  Lower  Canada.     Mr.  Berthelot  at  once 

entered  into  partnershij)  with  the  late  Sir  George  Cartier,  and  so  continued  till  he  was 

raised  to  the  Ben  .h  in  1859  as  Assistant  Judge.     On  tiie  resignation  of  Judge  Day, 

he  was  made  permanent  Judge.    He  was  twice  Batonnier,  in  1858  and  1859.    Jn  1875, 

the  Pope  appointed  him  Commander  of  the  Order  of  St.  Sylvestre.    His  old  partner. 

Sir  L.  H.  Lafontaine,  was  the  first  person  in  Canada  who  had  ever  received  this  honor, 

and  who  got  it  in  1853.     After  eighteen  years  of  hard  work  Judge  15erthelot  was 

superannuated  and    retired   to  private   life.      He   has   extensively    travelled  on  the 

Continent  of  Europe.     Like  the   two  Baronets  who  were  his  Law  partners  he  was 

connected  with   the  Rebellion  of  1837-38.     He  was  one  of  a  band  of  celebrated 

names  who  figured  as  arrested  in  1838,  viz  :  Sir  Louis  H.  Lafontaine,  D.  B.  \'igerand 

Beau  Viger,  M.  Papineau,  brother  of  the  Speaker,  Dr.  Lusignan,  Mr.  J-'abre,  father 

of  the  present  Archbishop  of  Montreal,  Mr.  DeBoucherville  and  Dr.  Perrault.     Mr. 

Berthelot    demanded  of  the   Governor  General,   Sir  John   Colborne,   why   he   was 

arrested,  received  no  answer,  out  in  a  few  days  after  was  told  to  leave  the  gaol  and  go 

home.     The  Judge  is  a  well-preserved  old  gentleman,  and  we  hope  may  be  spared 

yet  for  some  years  as  the  connecting  link  between  the  present  generation  and  the 

Patriots  of  1837-1838.

lliey  divided  and  went  north  and  west.  The  immediate  ancestors  of  Col.  [,ynian 
settled  in  Noriham|iton,  Mass.,  where  he  was  hum  (on  tiie  homestead  bought  trom 
the  Iiulians)  on  J7th  March,  iSiS.     Col.  I,yman  came  to  Montreal  in  183^5. 

Early  in  1837  l&gt;e  joined  the  guard  that  patrolled  the  city  at  night,  which  eventually 
became  No.  i  ('ompany  X'olunteer  Rifles  under  ("apt.  I'.  I",.  Leclere,  with  Lewis 
Moffatt  as  Lieut.,  and  W.  C.  Mereditli,  as  I'j.sign  (now  Chief  Justi«:e  Sir  \\ .  C. 
Meredith).  l''roin  this  Company  many  were  selected  to  serve  as  ofVicers  in  the 
Ward  liattalions. 

I-ieut.-Col.  Criftin.  S.V.,  commandeil  the  liattalion  of  Rifles,  composed  of  iluic 
Companies,  with  Mr.  Kardley,  as  Ailjutant,  who  had  lately  left  the  66lh  Regiment, 
and  was  considered  the  best  drill  in  the  city.  'I'he  companies  were  drilled  every  day, 
and  it  is  not  saying  loo  much  to  state  that  the  Mattalion  attained  a  good  degree  of 
discipline.  In  iiS^S,  the  l&gt;attali(jn  was  increased  to  five  companies,  and  Mr.  Lyman 
was  promoted  to  a  "  non.  com.''  On  the  organization  of  the  Militia,  in  1S45,  he  was 
appointed  Senior  Ensign  in  the  Montreal  Light  Infantry  under  Lieut. -Col.  Dyde, 
and  wid)  Lieut.  II.  1'',.  Montgomery  enrolled  a  Company  of  fifty-five  men.  When, 
for  a  second  time,  the  reorganization  of  the  Militia  took  place  in  1S47,  he  was  pro- 
moted to  be  1st  Lieut.  .\  new  .Militia  Law  came  into  force  on  ist  August,  1S55.

the  Jlrsf  Company  organized  under  the  new  law.  Lieut.  Haldimand  and  Ensign  J.  E. 
Mailhot  being  the  other  officers. 

This  Company  became  subsequently  No.  i  Cotnpany  of  the  ist  or  Prince  of 
Wales  Rifle  Regiueiit  of  (Janada.  It  is  not  too  much  to  say  that  Captain  Lyman's 
Company  was  a  model  Company,  and  furnished  officers  to  many  of  the  Companies 
afterwards  formed  in  the  city.  Tiiree  of  its  members  obtained  commissions  in  Her 
Majesty's  Army,  while  the  Captain  and  Lieutenant  declined  corresi)onding  positions 
in  the  loolh  Royal  Canadian  Regiment  at  its  formation.  We  will  now  give  an  extract 
from  General  Orders  of  November  20th.  1856  : — 

"  And  His  Excellency,  tl.e  Commaniler-in-Chief,  is  further  pleased  to  direct  that 
the  ^700  Senior  Captains  of  the  Volunteer  Companies  in  Montreal,  Captain  Theodore

these  officers  having  commenced  the  organization  of  a  force  in  that  city  whose  dis- 
cipline and  appearance  are  not  excelled  by  any  other  Cor])s  in  the  Province." 

He  was  appointed  Assist:.nt  Quarter-Master  (leneral  to  the  active  Force,  May 
26th,  i860.  He  was  promoted  to  be  Lieut. -Col.  for  special  services  in  the  Militia 
under  General  Orders  of  May,   1861.     January   i8th,    1865,   at   the  request  of  His 


454  GAZETTEER  OF  MONTREAL. 

Excellency  the  Commander-in-Chief,  he  accepted  the  Chairmanship  of  the  Board  of 
Examiners  of  Candidates  for  admission  to  the  MiHtary  School  of  Instruction  for  the 
5th  Military  District  sitting  at  Montreal. 

He  served  on  the  Brigade  Staff  as  Assistant  Quarter-master  General  in  both 
Fenian   Raids,    1866  and    1870,   and  retired,   retaining  rank  with  the  privilege  of 
wearing  uniform,  on  January  28th,  1876.  He  was  on  the  Staff  of  His  Excellency  the 
Governor  General,   the  Earl  of  Dufferin,  at   review  on  the  (Queen's  Biiihday,  24th 
May,  1878,  and  1879. 

In  liie  year  1841,  under  the  leadership  of  the  late  Hon.  John  Young,  he  assisted 
at  the  formation  of  the  Mercantile  Library  Association,  and  for  many  years  was  one 
of  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  as  the  Representative  of  the  Board  he  handed  over  to 
the  "  Eraser  Institute"  the  whole  Library  of  some  thousands  of  volumes  of  books, 
pictures,  and  the  marble  bust  of  the  late  John  Voung,  together  with  the  sum  of  seven 
thousand  dollars  ($7,000)  in  cash.  He  also  assisted  in  the  formation  of  the  Voung 
Men's  Christian  Association  of  Montreal,  the  first  association  formed  in  America.  He 
was  also  one  of  the  founders  of  the  Montreal  Gymnasium,  subsequently  merged  into 
the  Montreal  Amateur  Atiiletic  Association. 

MARIE  FISSON. 

This  lady  was  the  first  Superioress  of  the  "  Dames  du  Bon  Pasteur,"  itnd  is  known 
under  the  name  of  Ste.  Celeste.  Four  sisters  of  the  Good  Shepherd  arrived  in 
Montreal,  nth  June,  1844,  to  found  a  house  for  their  society.  Tiiey  came  from 
Angers,  France.  They  are  best  known  in  Montreal  as  the  community  who  have  had 
charge  'for  nearly  fifteen  years  of  the  Roman  Catholic  female  .sonc  j  in  the 
Women's  Jail,  Fullum  street.  As  their  great  work  is,  recovering  liie  fallen  among 
their  own  sex,  tliere  are  always  a  number  of  penitents  in  that  Institution.  Tiie  work 
wliich  they  have  done  is  indeed  great,  and  in  their  Mother  House  on  Sherbrooke 
street  tliey  have  a  Reformatory  for  girls  which  is  of  much  use  in  a  large  city  like 
Montreal.  I  will  give  the  names  of  these  first  four  sisters  as  two  of  their  names  arc 
English  and  two  French  :  the  mother,  as  I  have  said  above,  was  Marie  Fisson,  and 
the  others  names  were  Eliza  Chaffaux,  Alice  Ward  and  M.  Andrews. 

RFV.    DAVID   LINDSAY,    M.A., 

Was  born  in  the  City  of  London.  England,  ist  February,  1S21.  His  father  was 
James  Lindsay,  a  merchant  of  that  place  ;  his  mother  was  Elizabeth  Finch. 
Educated  in  London,  he  came  to  Canada  in  1843,  studied  for  the  Ministry  at 
Bishop's  College,  Lennoxville,  and  was  ordained  by  Bishop  I^ulford  in  March,  185 1. 
First  appointment  was  Frost  Village,  at  that  time  the  county  town.  He  also  had 
charge  of  Stukely.  In  1862,  Frost  Village  and  Waterloo  became  one  parish.  In 
1874,  he  was  appointed  Rural  Dean  of  the  District  of  Bedford,  and  two  years  later 
Archdeacon.  He  has  built  churches  at  Frost  Village,  Stukely,  Waterloo  and  Ful- 
ford.  He  inaugurated  missions,  now  prosi^erous  stations,  atBoscobel,  South  Ely  and

otlier  places.  He  has  almost  always  been  a  member  both  of  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee of  the  Diocese  and  a  Delegate  to  the  Provincial  Synod.  No  men  deserve  a 
higher  place  in  this  Gazetteer  than  the  Lindsays.  They  have  ever,  the  two 
brothers — the  late  Rev.  Robert  Lindsay,  Rector  of  St.  Thomas,  and  whose  sketch  is 
given  elsewhere  in  this  Gazetteer,  and  the  Archdeacon — his  brother,  tried  to 
develop  the  resources  of  their  adopted  country ,religious,  literary,  dramatic  and  social. 

ROSWELL  C.   l.VMAN. 

••  TiiK  subject  of  this  sketch,  Roswell  Corse  Lyman^  son  of  the  well-known  Mr.  Henry 
Lyman,  was  born  in  Montreal,  June  26,  1850.  He  was  educated  in  the  High 
School  of  this  city.  In  1868,  he  entered  the  business  of  the  then  firm  of  Lymans, 
Clare  &amp;  Co.,  and  became  a  partner  in  1878,  and  at  the  time  of  his  death  was  second 
senior  paiLner  of  the  present  firm  of  Lyman,  Sons  &amp;  Co.  Mr.  Lyman,  however,  by 
no  means  confined  his  attention  solely  to  business,  employing  his  leisure  hours  in 
promoting  many  useful  and  philanthropic  objects.  Especially  was  he  interested  in 
promoting  antiquarian  and  historic  research,  and  possessed  n  large  collection  of 
sketches  which  he  h.ad  made  of  many  of  the  old,  interesting  and  historic  buildings  of 
tliis  City  and  Quebec.  He  was  thus  naturally  a  very  active  member  of  the  Numis- 
matic and  Antiquarian  Society,  and  was  for  some  time  one  of  the  editing  committee 
of  the  Society's  Journal,  the  Canadian  Antiquarian^  to  which  he  contributed  a  num- 
ber of  valuable  and  interesting  papers,  and  in  addition  had  for  some  years  past  been 
the  Treasurer  of  that  Society.  Several  valuable  articles  from  his  pen  upon  historical 
subjects  were  also  contributed  to  the  Dcminion  I/ittstrated,  wliich,  as  well  as  all 
other  enterprises  for  the  promotion  of  Canadian  sentiment,  could  count  upon  his 
support.  He  took  a  very  warm  interest  in  the  movement  for  a  closer  union  of  the 
Empire,  and  was  one  of  the  founders  of  the  Imperial  Federation  League  in  Canada, 
and  had  been  since  1887  the  Treasurer  of  the  Montreal  Branch  and  a  Member  of 
tlie  General  Council  of  the  League  in  Canada.  He  was  a  life  member  of  the 
Mechanics'  Listitute,  a  member  of  the  Art  Association  and  the  Young  Men's 
Christian  Association.  Modest  and  retiring,  generous  to  a  fault,  upright  and  con- 
scientious in  fulfilment  of  duty,  patient  in  suffering,  always  thinking  of  others  rather 
than  of  himself,  a  true  Christian  and  Patriot,  he  was  beloved  and  honored  by  all 
who  really  knew  him.  He  died  on  the  22nd  February,  1892,  at  the  early  age  of 
forty-two.  His  brother  is  the  partner  in  the  well-known  legal  firm  of  Dunloj)  &amp; 
Lyman." 

JOHN  JAMES  BROWNE 

Was  born  in  Quebec,  October  12th,  1837.  At  the  age  of  nineteen  he  commenced 
his  profession  of  an  architect,  and  entered  into  four  competitions  with  his  seniors  and 
was  successful,  and  since  that  time  he  has  designed  and  superintended  many  of  our 
noble  edifices  which  adorn  not  only  our  city  but  also  other  towns  throughou  the 


456  GAZETTEER  OP  UONTREAL. 

Dominion.  He  erected  the  Albert  buildings,  three  banks,  twenty-four  markets  and 
there  police  stations,  which  arc  all  great  additions  to  our  public  buildings,  five  fire 
stations,  four  churches,  Stormcnt  Cotton  Mills,  Cornwall,  the  foundry  of  William 
Clendinneng,  and  eight  monuments  and  tombs  in  the  Roman  Catholic  Cemetery. 
Mr.  Browne  designed  the  Rectory  for  Christ  Church  Cathedral ;  for  William  Clen- 
dinneng, Esq.,  two  warehouses  ;  a  villa  for  A.  F.  Gault,  Es(]..  and  in  Toronto,  Ont., 
a  villa  for  John  Gordon,  Esq.;  residence  for  W.P.Seybold  ;  a  terrace  of  thirteen  houses 
for  the  Colonial  B.  &amp;  I.  Association;  five  houses  for  Wm.  Rodden,  Esq. ;  and  four- 
teen houses  for  Dr.  O'Leary.  Mr.  Browne  visited  Europe  four  times,  and  travelled 
throughout  England,  Scotland,  Ireland,  France  and  Germany,  examining  all  the 
ancient  and  modern  buildings  that  were  considered  of  any  note,  and  gained  a  large 
amount  of  valuable  information  which  he  could  never  have  attained  otherwise,  hence 
the  success  of  his  professional  career.  In  December,  1867,  he  married  a  daugliter 
of  the  late  Thomas  Hay,  Leith,  .Scotland.  Perhaps  no  architect  has  erected  so 
many  and  various  kinds  of  buildings  as  Mr.  Browne,  and  being  yet  in  the  prime  of 
life,  many  important  buildings  in  the  future  will  be  designed  by  him. 

REV.  SAMUEL  MASSEY 

Was  born  at  Wincham,  Cheshire,  England,  December,  1817.  He  was  educated  in 
Lostock  Gralam.  Wnen  a  young  man,  for  eight  years  he  taught  the  public  schools 
of  Helsly  and  Poyntcn,  in  Cheshire.  He  was  afterwards  connected  with  the  mission 
work  of  the  City  of  Manchester,  and  in  1853  came  to  Montreal,  and  has  ever  since 
been  engaged  in  many  Christian  enterprises.  For  eleven  years  he  was  Pastor  of 
Chaboillez  Square  and  Inspector  Street  Church.  During  a  long  and  busy  life  he  has 
been  a  great  worker  in  the  Temperance  cause,  and  in  religious  literature  he  has  ever 
been  one  of  our  foremost  Authors.  The  following  have  come  from  his  fertile  brain 
and  pen: — "  A  Voice  to  Christian  Mothers,"  "Self-Improvement,"  "The  Dying 
Peer,"  "Sir  Henry  Havelock,''  ''Jesus  and  the  Poor,"  "Papers  for  Toung  Men," 
"The  Black  and  Dark  Nights,"  "Breakers  Ahead,"  "What  Went  Ye  Out  for  to 
See?  "  and  others.  He  founded,  with  the  late  Dr.  P.  P.  Carpenter,  the  first  Sanitary 
Association  in  Montreal.  It  did  a  splendid  work  in  its  day,  cleaning  yards  and 
lanes,  and  ventilating  and  improving  the  houses  of  the  citizens.  We  all  know  wl^at 
an  important  department  the  Sanitary  one  is  in  tlie  present  Corporation  of  Montreal. 
After  many  years  of  ministerial  labor,  Mr.  Massey  joined  the  Church  of  lingiand, 
and  is  now  ministering  in  conncc'iion  with  the  Church  of  St.  James  the  Apostle, 
Rev.  Canon  Ellegood,  Rector.  Rev.  Mr.  Massey  married,  in  1840,  May  Fryer,  daugh- 
ter of  Thomas  Fryer,  of  Winnington.  His  son  is  favorably  known,  to  the  Volunteers 
especially,  as  well  as  to  the  citizens  at  large  of  Montreal.  Colonel  Massey  is  one  of 
our  most  eflicient  officers  of  Volunteers,  and  the  Regiment  which  he  commands,  the 
6th  Fusiliers,  is  one  of  the  best  disciplined  and  orderly  bodies  of  men  in  all  the 
Volunteer  Register.

REV.  JOHN   ALLAN 

Was  born  al  .\herdeen,  Scotland,  September  6th,  1S13.  After  having  gone  through 
his  school  course,  lie  left  Aberdeen  at  seventeen,  for  London.  England,  where  for 
some  time  he  was  engaged  in  commercial  pursuits,  'liiis  did  not  agree  with  iiis 
studious  nature,  and  he  entered  King's  College,  London.  After  his  college  curri- 
culum, he  taught  for  some  years  a  school  in  Wales.  In  ^Larch,  1847,  '^'^  "''^^ 
a])pointed  to  the  Head  ^L'^stership  of  the  "  Holy  Trinity  School,''  Birkenhead,  Eng- 
land, a  position  which  he  held  for  nearly  ten  years.  He  also  engaged  in  private 
tuition,  preparing  the  sons  of  gentlemen  for  their  final  examinations  for  the  Army  and 
Navy,  besides  giving  lectures.  In  September,  1856,  he  determined  to  enter  into 
"  Holy  Orders,"  becoming  a  student  in  Theology  at  the  Thoelogical  College  of 
St.  Bees,  in  Cumberland.  When  he  had  finished  his  curriculum  in  this  institution  he 
sailed  for  Canada  and  went  direct  to  l&gt;ondon,  Canada  West.  On  the  29th  Septem- 
ber, 1858,  he  was  ordained  Deacon  by  the  late  Bishop  Cronyn.  While  ofificialing  in 
London,  the  Reformatorv  Prison  for  Lower  Canada  was  established  at  Isle  aux 
Noix,  and  Mr.  Allan  was  api)ointed  in  November,  1858,  ProtestantChaplain.  In  1861, 
the  Fort  at  "  Isle  aux  Noix  "  was  required  for  military  purposes,  and  the  Prison  was 
removed  to  St.  Vincent  de  Paul.  At  Confederation,  1867,  it  was  transferred  by 
the  old  Government  of  Canada  to  the  new  Province  of  (Quebec,  and  Mr.  Allan  was 
left  undisturbed  until  the  removal  of  the  Reformatory  Boys  on  i6th  January,  1873, 
from  St.  Vincent  de  Paul  to  the  new  Institution,  conducted  by  the  IJelgian  Brothers 
on  Mignonne  Street,  Montreal.  Prior  to  the  removal  of  the  prisoners  the  Dominion 
Government  had  acquired  the  ground  and  buildings  from  the  Government  for  a 
Penitentiary  for  the  Province.  In  May,  1873,  Mr.  Allan  was  ai)pointed  Protestant 
Chaplain  of  this  new  Institution,  and  on  May  21,  1873,  the  Penitentiary  was  opened 
by  the  arrival  from  Kingston  of  119  convicts.  In  addition  to  his  ])rison  duties  he 
also  undertook  other  work  at  the  request  of  the  Bishop.  The  subject  of  our  skelcii 
was  very  fond  of  gardening,  and  to  this  he  devoted  all  the  spare  time  he  had.  He 
married  July  23,  1844,  Miss  Jane  Oakden,  and  had  seven  children,  one  of  his  sons 
being  a  clergyman  in  London,  England.  Mrs.  Allan  died  Augusc  30,  1S76,  in  the 
fifty-ninth  year  of  her  age.  On  September  18,  1880,  Mr.  Allan  married  a  second 
time,  Miss  Isabella  T.  Young,  wiio  died  May  30,  1889.  Mr.  Allan  died  on  the 
29th  September,  1889.  A  work  which  might  fairly  be  considered  his  life  work 
would  have  appeared  in  a  few  months,  had  his  life  been  spared,  which  was  to  prove 
the  authenticity  of  the  Scriptures  by  means  of  the  two  great  witnesses  in  heaven, 
"  The  Sun  and  the  Moon."  Tiiis  work,  so  far  as  it  had  gone,  and  it  was  well 
advanced,  had  the  unqualified  approval  of  the  Archbishop  of  Canterbury,  together 
with  an  expression  from  the  Archbishop  of  his  willingness  to  assist  him  by  every 
means  in  his  power.  It  is  to  be  hoped  that  some  one  of  his  children,  and  if  not 
them,  some  publishing  house  or  society  will  publish  the  above  work,  that  it  may 
be  given  to  the  world. 


4S8  OAZKTTliKR  OF  MONTREAL. 

HON.  JUDGE  TAIT. 

'I'lfis  well-known  Jud^^e  was  born  at  Melbourne,  Quebec,  20th  May,  1842,  licncc  his 
baptismal  name — Melbourne  McTaggart.  His  father  was  the  late  Thomas  Tait,  who 
settled  in  that  Township  as  early  as  1834,  and  who  afterwards  became  one  of  the 
leading  men  of  the  place — indeed,  throughout  the  Eastern  Townships.  The  subject 
of  our  sketch  was  educated  in  St.  Francis  College.  In  1859,  he  began  the  study  of 
Law  in  Montreal  in  the  office  of  Bethune  &amp;  Dunkin  ;  the  latter,  afterwards,  being 
Judge  of  the  Superior  Court  and  one  of  the  Privy  Council  of  Canada.  He  also  then 
attended  the  Lectures  on  Law  in  that  Faculty  in  McCill  College,  and  after  an  excel- 
lent curriculum  graduated  B.C.L.  in  1862.  He  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  in  June,  1863, 
and  immediately  commenced  practice  witli  the  Hon.  Mr.  Webb,  Q.C.,  in  his  native 
place.  In  1870,  he  removed  to  Montreal,  and  became  a  i)artncr  with  Hon.  J.J.  C. 
Abbott,  Q.C.,  now  Premier  of  Canada.  Some  years  ago  the  senior  partner,  Mr. 
Abbott,  retired  from  the  firm,  and  Mr.  Tait  was  then  its  practical  head.  In  1882,  he 
was  made  a  (Queen's  Counsellor,  and  was  for  years  the  Treasurer  of  the  Bar  of 
Montreal.  Amidst  all  his  engagements  he  had  time  to  devote  a  little  to  military 
work.  In  1864,  he  took  a  first-class  certificate  in  Quebec  at  the  Military  School  ;  was 
Lieutenant  of  one  of  the  Companies  of  the  54th  Battalion  when  it  was  called  out  on 
the  occasion  of  tiie  Fenian  troubles.  Afterwards  he  became  Captain,  and  retired  when 
he  removed  to  Montreal.  After  many  successful  years  as  a  member  of  the  Bar  of 
Montreal,  he  was  raised  to  the  high  position  which  he  now  holds — a  Judge  of  the 
Superior  Court  of  the  Province  of  Quebec. 

In  1863,  Judge  Tait  married  Monica,  daughter  of  the  late  J.  S.  Holmes,  of 
Montreal,  who  dying  in  Kingston,  in  1876,  he  again  married,  in  1878,  Miss  Kaign,  of 
Newport,  R.  I.,  United  States.  Judge  Tait  commands  a  great  amount  of  esteem  from 
his  confreres  on  the  Bench  as  well  as  from  the  Bar  in  general,  and  is  an  example  how 
men  can  succeed  if  they  are  determined  honestly  to  do  so. 

J.  B.  McCONNELL,    M.D., 

Was  born  28th  August,  185 1,  at  Chatham,  County  of  Argenteuil.  His  father  was  a 
successful  farmer  of  that  place  ;  and  his  mother,  Martha  Jane  Bradford,  daughter  of 
Rev.  Richard  Bradford,  who  v-as  the  first  English  Church  minister  at  Chatham.  This 
Clergyman  had  a  rather  remarkable  career.  He  was  once  in  New  York  (in  1782) 
engaged  in  business.  He  then  came  to  Canada  as  a  United  Empire  Loyalist,  and  in 
the  War  of  181 2  was  Chaplain  to  the  4gth  Regiment.  Afterwards  he  built  a  fine 
house  on  the  Ottawa,  and  at  this  time  owned  nearly  the  whole  Township  of  Chatham 
— 12  miles  square.  He  went  with  the  celebrated  Captain  Cook  in  one  of  his  voyages 
around  the  world;  afterwards  studied  with  Rev.  Mr.  Jeffreys,  whose  daughter  he 
married,  and  entered  the  Church  of  England.  He  had  a  large  family  of  children ; 
the  youngest  daughter  married  Rev.  Joseph  Abbott,  whose  son  is  now  the  Premier 
of  Canada.

John  Bradford  McConnell,  the  subject  of  our  sketch,  entered  McGill  College  in 
1S69,  and  graduated  in  1873.  In  187 1,  he  went  through  the  Military  School,  and  was 
appointed  Lieutenant  to  the  nth  IJattalion  of  Argenteuil  Rangers.  For  eight  years 
he  was  Surgeon  to  the  Prince  of  Wales  Rifles.  He  has  been  engaged  in  JJishop's  Col-

in  1875,  Theodora  l.ovell,  daugliter  of  Robert  Miller,  who  is  now  one  of  our  oldest 
and  best  known  citizens,  and  whose  short  sketch  ai)pears  in  this  Gazettkkk. 

J.  ]).  LAW  I, OR 

Was  born  in  the  County  Wicklow,  Ireland,  on  the  8th  of  September,  1829.  His 
father  was  a  farmer,  who  sold  out  his  interest  in  his  holding  to  go  and  seek  a  home 
elsewhere,  and  finally  settled  in  Liverpool,  England,  where  he  spent  the  remainder 
of  his  days.  His  son  John  received  a  common  school  education  in  Liverpool,  and 
was  afterwards  apprenticed  to  the  trade  of  machinist,  and  at  the  age  of  twenty-one 
emigrated  to  the  United  States.  He  landed  in  New  York,  September,  1S50.  Trade 
was  exceedingly  dull  at  this  time,  and  he  being  an  entire  stranger  found  it  very 
difficult  to  get  enijjloyment.  However,  nothing  daunted  at  the  obstacles  before 
him,  he  fought  his  way  manfully  to  the  front.  Having  a  peculiar  aptitude  for  his 
])articular  calling,  Mr.  Lawlor  soon  made  himself  valuable  to  his  employers.  To  him 
v\'as  entrusted  the  oversight  of  the  most  important  works  in  the  establishments  where 
he  was  employed.  A  year  or  two  after  his  coming  to  the  United  States,  one  of  the 
most  useful  of  modern  inventions — the  Sewing  Machine — was  presented  to  the 
world.  Mr.  Lawlor  had  the  honor  of  assisting  the  late  Mr.  Singer  in  i)erfccting  in  all 
its  parts  the  celebrated  '•  Singer  Sewing  Machine."  No  sooner  did  he  get  the  idea 
of  sewing  by  machinery  than  he  applied  himself  exclusively  to  the  sewing  machine 
business.  In  the  year  1S57,  he  invented  and  perfected  the  famous  "  Lawlor  Sewing 
Machine."  In  1S58  he  removed  from  New  York  City  to  Buffalo,  and  there  com- 
menced the  manufacture  of  his  invention,  in  company  with  R.  H.  Stevens,  Esq.,  a 
prominent  lawyer  of  the  latter  city ;  but,  owin.;  to  the  monopoly  granted  richer 
and  more  influential  concerns  by  the  extension  of  patents,  who  demanded  high 
royalty,  Mr.  Lawlor  was  compelled  to  seek  "  fresh  fields  and  pastures  new  "  for 
the  successful  prosecution  of  his  business,  and  came  to  Canada  in  the  year  1861. 
His  partner,  Mr.  Stevens,  being  an  American  gentleman,  and  desirous  of  remaining 
in  the  United  States,  Mr.  Lawlor  was  compelled  to  dissolve  business  relations  with 
him,  and  established  himself  in  the  City  of  Montreal,  where  he  subsequently  com- 
menced the  manufiicture  of  his  sewing  machines.  He  obtained  several  patents,  both 
in  the  United  States  and  Canada,  on  sewing  machines  and  improvements  on  sewing 
machines  for  the  next  twenty  years.  He  invented  a  most  superior  washing  machine, 
for  which  he  obtained  patents  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  in  the  year  1875.  The 
Lawlor  sewing  machine  was  considered  by  competent  authorities  to  be  the  best 
machine  ever  invented. 

After  many  years  in  th's   business  he  gave  up  sewing  machines  entirely,  other

competitors  having  entered  the  Canadian  field,  and  for  the  past  few  years  lie  has 
devoted  himself  as  Agent  in  the  city  for  all  kinds  of  musical  and  sewing  instruments, 
and  particularly  to  Insurance  of  all  kinds,  in  which  branches  he  is  Iniilding  up  a 
large  and  successful  business.

Counsel  before  that  tribunal. 

On  the  resignation  of  the  Hon.  Mr.  Justice  Wurtele  as  Professor  of  Commercial 
Law  in  McGill  Ti.iw  Faculty,  Doctor  Davidson  was  appointed  by  the  Governors  to 
that  Chair  in  his  stead,  and  still  occupies  that  position.  He  was  for  many  years  one

tice. He  has  taken  a  prominent  part  in  all  Church  matters  since  1864,  and  is

JOHN  DOUGALL 

Was  born  in  Paisley,  Scotland,  July  8,  1808.  His  grandfather  was  Duncan  Dougall, 
his  father  John  Dougall.  He  had  two  boys,  John  and  James.  John,  who  became 
renowned  as  the  proprietor  of  the  Witness,  and  James,  who  was  well  known,  espe- 
cially in  the  West  as  the  great  nursery  man  of  \Vindsor,  Ont.  At  eighteen  years 
of  age,  John  Dougall  sailed  for  Canada  in  the  year  1826.  After  some  time  he  began 
a  book  and  stationery  business  in  Montreal.  It  was  then  he  started  with  James 
Court  the  Canada  Temperance  Advocate.  Afterwards  i.  changed  hands,  J.  C. 
Becket  taking  the  management  of  it,  while  Mr.  Dougall  embarked  in  a  new  enter- 
]iii.se,  the  issuing  of  the  IVeek/y  ll'itness  in  the  winter  of  1845-46.  He  soon  ob- 
tained over  eight  iumdred  subscribers,  which  at  the  price  the  papers  sold  at,  $3.00 
per  annum,  in  those  days  was  considered  a  handsome  thing.  The  paper  has  long 
ago  become  a  daily,  and  tlie  Il^itness  is  looked  upon  as  one  of  tlie  Institutions  of 
Montreal.  Mr.  Dougall  was  for  over  fifty  years  a  total  abstainer.  Mr.  Dougall  often 
expressed  a  wisii  to  die  suddenly  rather  tiian  by  a  lingering  sickness.  He  had 
his  wish.  He  was  living  with  his  son,  Mr.  James  Dougall,  at  Flushing,  Long  Island, 
as  he  had  for  years  been  publishing  the  New  Vork  Witness,  and  suddenly  at  break- 
fast he  breathed  his  last. 

Mr.  Dougall  had  married  F^lizabeth  Redpath,  eldest  daughter  of  Mr.  John  Red- 
path.  She  died  in  1883.  His  sons  are  Mr.  John  Redpath  Dougall,  the  present 
proprietor  of  the  Montreal  Witness,  and  James  Dougall  of  the  New  York  Witness, 
and  several  daughters.  One  of  the  daughters  ha.s  been  quite  encouraged  by  the 
high  encomiums  given  her  on  a  book  she  has  lately  published  in  England.

The  premises  of  i lie  Daily  Witness  arc  of  large  extent  in  St.  Jiunes  street,  ;inci 
the  thorough  organization  of  all  its  de|Kirtnients  as  that  of  a  first-class  publishing 
house  can  be  seen  through  all  its  management.  Mr.  Dougall  when  he  first  came  to 
Canada,  and  for  some  lime  after,  occasionally  wrote  both  in  prose  and  verse,  for  the 
Jlera  &lt;/ and  other  papers.  A  few  of  his  poems  had  the  high  honor  of  appearing  in 
the  "  ]5ook  of  Scottish  Song,"  published  in  Kdinburgh,  Scotland,  by  JJlackie  &amp;  Son, 
in  1854.  'I'his  beautiful  volume  was  edited  by  Alexander  Whitelaw.  Perhaps  no 
man  has  ever  done  the  amount  of  good  Mr.  Dougall  has  done  in  iiii  advocacy 
of  Temperance,  and  though  sometimes  his  paper  was  placed  under  the  ban  on 
account  of  its  plain  speaking,  still  the  seeds  sown  will  yet  bring  forth  fruit  abun- 
dantly, and  John  Dougall  will  be  a  name  well  known  and  remembered,  not  only  in 
Montreal,  but  throughout  Canada,   when  thousands  now  living  are  totally  forgotten. 

FREDERICK  STYI.KS   LYMAN,  Q.C. 

Was  bom  in  Montreal,  January  6,  1S44,  and  is  the  eldest  son  of  the  well-known 
citizen,  Henry  Lyman,  Ksq.  He  received  his  education  in  the  old  High  School  and 
in  McGill  University.  After  this  he  went  to  England  and  studied  for  some  time  at 
St.  John's  College,  Cambridge,  where  he  took  the  degree  of  B.A.  in  ICS67.  On  his 
return  to  his  native  city  he  received  from  his  Alma  Mater  the  degree  of  B.C.F/.  He 
selected  Law  as  a  profession,  and  having  passed  a  most  creditable  examination  be- 
fore finally  commencing  his  career  in  Law  he  travelled  for  a  year  over  Europe,  where 
he  studied  the  various  legal  aspects  of  the  different  countries  visited.  On  returning 
to  Montreal,  he  entered  into  partnership  with  John  Duiilop,  ().C.,  a  gentleman  be- 
longing to  an  old  family  well  known  in  the  city.  Mr.  Lyman  married  August  15, 
1871,  Louisa  Lyman.  His  brother  is  connected  with  the  father  in  the  extensive 
business  of  Lyman,  Sons  &amp;  Co.,  of  Montreal  :  and  Lyman,  Brothers  &amp;  Co.,  of 
Toronto.     Mr.  Fvyman  was  made  a  Queen's  Counsellor,  January,  1S91. 

COLONEL  A.    A.  STEVENSON. 

Alexander  Allan  Stkvknson  is  perhaps  as  well  known  as  any  citizen  in  Montreal. 
His  parents  were  James  Stevenson,  of  Riccarton,  Ayreshire,  Scotland,  and  Janet 
Frances  Allan,  a  cousin  of  the  poet  Burns  and  sister  of  the  late  Capt.  Allan, 
and  aunt  of  the  late  Sir  Hugh  Allan  and  Andrew  Allan.  He  was  educated  at 
Riccarton  School,  and  came  to  Canada,  Montreal,  in  1846,  where  he  has  been 
ever  since.  On  arrival  here  he  entered  a  printing  office,  and  in  1853  began 
business  under  the  firm  of  Moore,  Owler  &amp;  Stevenson.  During  this  time  they 
published  the  Snn,  also  for  some  years  the  Mackay  Montreal  Directory,  afterwards 
merged  into  the  present  "  Lovell's  Directory."  On  the  retirement  of  the  first  tv/o 
members  of  the  firm,  Mr.  Stevenson  carried  on  the  business  by  himself.  \\\  1879 
it  was  merged   into  the  Montreal  Printing  Company.

lie  was  clcclccl  in  i(S6i  Councillor  for  the  West  Ward.  He  was  then  the 
Chairman  of  the  Kire  Alarm  Telegraph  Constniclion  Committee.  He  served  as 
Councillor  for  six  years.  Diirinj^  this  period  he  made  the  first  motion  in  the 
Council  to  aciiuire  the  mountain  as  a  public  park.  (Ireat  opposition  was  dis- 
played to  this  by  members  of  the  Council,  but  he  succeeded  at  last,  and  Mon- 
treal has  to-day  the  finest  i)ark  on  the  Continent  of  .\merica.  He  retired  from 
the  Council  in  1867,  but  in  1SS2  was  again  induced  to  enter  it.  He  was  elected 
as  Alderman  for  his  late  Ward  in  18S2,  was  the  means  of  getting  the  jjresent 
Drill  Hall  erected,  and  has  ever  since  continued  in  the  Council  ('luimber.  In 
1886,  he  was  made  Chairman  of  the  Kire  Committee,  and  it  is  not  too  much  to 
say  that  it  is  greatly  owing  to  the  gallant  Colonel's  military  discipline  that  this 
important  branch  of  the  civic  service  has  attained  to  such  perfect  discipline  that 
their  motlo  should  be  over  the  whole  American  Continent,  "  Secundus   Nulli." 

It  is,  however,  in  his  military  career  that  Col.  .Stevenson  is  best  known  to 
the  citizens  of  Montreal.  The  most  correct  sketch  of  his  career  as  a  soldier  is 
found  in  his  address  to  the  men  in  his  farewell  order  of  April  24,  1891,  where  he 
says : 

"Having  been  connected  with  the  Battery  since  its  organization  in  July,  1885, 
and  having  had  the  honoi  of  commanding  it  since  April,  1857,  and  with  the  ex- 
ception of  three  months'  absence  in  Europe,  having  been  personally  present  at 
every  out-door  parade  of  the  corps  for  that  whole  period  of  nearly  thirty-six 
years,  I  am  in  a  i)osition  to  testify,  as  I  do  most  cheerfully,  to  the  loyal, 
patriotic  and  martial  si)irit  which  has  animated  its  members  from  lirst  to  last. 
They  have  fully  proved  the  appropriateness  of  the  Battery  motto,  '  Always  on 
hand,'  by  being  on  hand  whenever  required  and  ready  for  any  duty. 

"  The  Battery  has  responded  with  alacrity  to  every  call  made  upon  it,  whether 
for  salutes  or  receptions  on  pub'^'c  occasions,  or  assisting  the  civil  power  in  repress- 
ing local  disturbance  or  in  resisting  invasion,  as  in  1866  and  1870,  when  stationed 
for  several  weeks  on  the  Huntingdon  frontier.  In  other  respects,  also,  it  has  ren- 
dered the  city  good  service,  as  for  instance  in  raising  a  fund  for  restoring  the  Nel- 
son monument,  and  in  the  famous  ascent  of  the  Battery  to  the  top  of  Mount  Royal 
before  any  roads  were  constructed,  to  fire  a  Royal  salute  at  noon  of  Monday,  the 
10th  November,  1862,  when  H.R.H.  the  Prince  of  Wales  attained  his  majority, 
which  had  the  effect  of  materially  influencing  public  opinion  in  favor  of  purchasing 
the  mountain  for  a  public  park — that  park  which  is  now  the  glory  of  the  citizens  of 
Montreal. 

"  It  has  always  been  on  the  best  terms  of  friendship  with  the  other  city  corps, 
and  with  the  militia  forces  of  Canada  and  the  United  States.  The  military  bearing 
and  exemplary  conduct  of  its  members  have  been  the  subject  of  universal  remark  on 
all  occasions.  As  a  corps  it  has  paid  visits  to  Quebec,  Chambly,  Knowlton,  Kings- 
ton, Toronto,  Hamilton,  St.  Catharines,  Niagara  Falls  and  to  St.  Albans,  N.Y.,. 
Boston  and  Portland.     When  visiting  New  York,  in  1858,  it  had  the  honor  of  being 


4^4  GAZETTEER  OK  MONTREAL, 

the  guest  of  tht;  7th  Regiment,  National  (iiiard,  and  i)ataded  on  the  right  of  that 
famous  regiment  in  the  great  military  demonstration  held  in  New  York  to  celebrate 
the  laying  of  the  first  Atlantic  cable.  J'he  Battery  enjoys  tiie  distinction  of 
being  the  only  British  military  organization  wliich  has  marched  through  Neiv  York 
and  Boston  carrying  the  JJritish  flag  since  the  American  Revolution.  These  flicts 
are  mentioned  to  ac([uaint  the  younger  members  of  the  Battery  with  its  past  record, 
and  to  stimulate  them  to  such  exertions  as  will  ensure  its  high  character  being  sus- 
tained in  the  future. 

"  I  naturally  experience  a  deep  feeling  of  regret  at  severing  my  connection  with 
the  old  Battery,  to  which  1  am  so  warmly  attached,  but  I  have  the  satisfaction  of 
knowing  that  I  leave  it  in  good  order  and  in  the  hands  of  capable  and  zealous 
officers,  who  will,  I  am  sure,  do  all  in  their  power  to  increase  its  efficiency.  1  earn- 
estly trust  that  my  successor  will  receive  from  the  members  of  the  corps  such  a 
ready  obedience  of  orders,  submission  to  discipline  and  faithful  discharge  of  duty,  as 
will  place  the  I^attery  even  yet  higher  in  the  estimation  of  the  Militia  authorities  and 
the  public  generally.  So  long  as  I  am  spared  I  will  regard  its  career  with  deep 
interest,  and  earnestly  hope  and  trust  that  its  ranks  may  be  ever  full  of  young  men 
strongly  imbued  with  the  spirit  of  loyalty  and  devotion  to  the  Queen  and  country. 
That  Queen,  the  best  and  the  best  beloved  in  the  universe,  and  that  country  yet  to 
be  one  of  the  grandest  on  the  face  of  the  earth. 

'•  And  now,  my  gallant  gunners,  I  bid  you  an  affectionate  farewell,  and  may 
Heaven  bless  you  every  one." 

Col.  Stevenson  has  also  been  President  of  the  Caledonian  and  St.  Andrew's 
Societies,  and  has  been  connected  witn  so  many  organizations  and  societies  that 
space  will  not  permit  us  to  name  them  all.

On  the  ist  of  November,  1843,  these  ladies  determined  to  begin  a  Society  in  the  then 
village  of  Longueuil,  with  the  approval  of  the  Bishop,  and  under  the  direction  of 
the  Oblate  Fathers.  They  took  the  name  of  "Seeurs  des  Saints  Noms  de  Jesus  et 
Marie,"  and  their  Community  was  styled  "  The  Sisters  of  Longueuil."  Next 
year,  8th  December,  1S44,  these  three  founders  of  the  order  made  their  vows,  and 
the  Community  was  erected  canonically  for  the  instruction  of  young  persons. 

In  1849,  ^'^&lt;-'  Oblate  Fathers,  having  left  Longueuil  to  locate  in  Montreal,  ceased 
to  direct  the  Institution,  and  Messire  Brassard  then  became  the  Superior.  Some 
years  ago  the  Community  built  one  of  the  largest  establishments  at  Hochv.laga, 
where  they  have,  perhaps,  the  finest  school  for  girls  in  the  Province.  The  annexa- 
tion  of  Hochelaga  to  Montreal  has  mucn  militated  against  the  Convent,  as  it  is 
being  rapidly  surrounded  by  manufactories  and  buildings  of  all  kinds.  They  have 
therefore  decided  to  leave  the  east  end,  and  have  purchased  "  Thornbury  "  property 
at  Outremont,  where  they  will  erect  a  large  establishment  in  place  of  the  one  at 
Hochelaga.

DR.    DK  .SOLA. 


CAZETTEKR    OK    MONTREAL.  465 

REV.    ABRAHAM  i&gt;k  SOLA,  LL.D., 

Who  for  many  years  was  so  familiar  a  figure  in  literary  circles  in  MoiUreal,  and  who 
earned  so  wide  and  deserved  a  reputation  as  an  Oriental  scliolar  and  theologian,  was 
a  descendant  of  an  illustrious  Spanish-Jewish  family.  The  marvellous  history  of 
Israel  must  ever  be  of  peculiar  interest  to  mankind,  and,  perhaps,  no  chajjier  in  the 
post-l)il)lical  i)ortion  of  that  history  possesses  more  charm  than  that  which  relates 
about  the  jews  of  .Spain  and  I'ortugal,  or  Se/// a ri////i  as  they  are  styled.  Tiiese  lived 
free  and  untrammeled  during  those  niediajval  times  when  their  brethren  in  less 
favored  countries  were  weighed  down  by  the  burden  of  oppression,  and  witii  the 
Saracens  ilii;y  kept  alive  the  tlame  of  learning  and  science  in  the  Iberian  Peninsula 
at  a  time  when  it  burnt  lowest  in  the  rest  of  Kurope.  Power,  rank  and  honor  wera 
theirs  ;  and  when  afterwards  clouds  obscin-ed  the  sky  of  their  i)rosperity,  and  the 
storm  of  persecution  burst  ])iiilessly  over  their  heads,  their  record  of  heroic  martyrdom 
and  thrilling  adventure  is  a  tale  as  fascinating  as  that  of  many  of  the  most  imaginative 
pages  of  fiction. 

Among  the  many  bright  ni^acs  which  illumined  Spanish-Jewish  history,  that  of 
de  Sola  stands  prominent.  The  de  Solas  had  settled  in  Andalusia  as  early  as  the 
sixth  century,  whence  they  had  conic  from  Judea  by  gradual  stages  through 
Northern  Africa.  They  held  various  offices  under  the  Saracenic  Caliphs  at  Toledo 
and  Cordova,  and  afterwards  when  they  removed  to  Navarre  they  were  received  with 
like  tavor  by  the  Gothic  Princes.  From  their  estate  in  this  province,  their  surname  had 
its  origin.  A  particularly  distinguished  member  of  the  family  was  Don  Bartolomcu 
de  Sola,  who,  in  reward  for  his  services,  was  ennobled,  and,  after  being  a  Minister  of 
State,  I-.eld  for  a  while  the  position  of  Viceroy  of  Navarre. 

During  the  14th  Century  another  de  Sola  distinguished  himself  fighting  under  the 
Infimte  of  Aragon,  and  figured  conspicuously  in  the  Spanish  Wars  of  that  jjcriod. 
During  the  succeeding  centuries  the  fiimily  continued  to  hold  an  illustrious  place, 
owing  to  the  large  number  of  eminent  scholars,  physicians  and  statesmen  it  produced. 
Their  forLimes,  however,  changed  when  King  Ferdinand,  having  by  the  Conquest  of 
Granada  destroyed  the  last  vestige  of  Moorish  jiower  in  Spain,  decided  to  drive 
therefrom  all  who  did  not  conform  to  the  dominant  fiith  ;  and  in  1492,  was  i)romul- 
gated  the  terrible  edict  of  expulsion,  which,  at  one  blow,  deprived  hundreds  of  thou- 
sands of  S[)ain's  most  intelligent  and  industrious  inhabitants  of  happy  and  prosperous 
homes.  The  de  Solas  took  refuge  in  Holland,  but  a  branch  of  the  family  continued  to 
hold  business  connections  with  Lisbon,  and  eventually  some  of  them  settled  in  the 
Portuguese  Capital,  where  they  amassed  much  wealth.  Watched  by  the  Inquisition, 
they,  like  many  other  Portuguese  Jews,  for  some  time  evaded  the  danger  by  assum- 
ing to  become  Maiannos  or  Nncvos  C/irisfiaiios — as  converted  Jews  were  styled — 
while  they  secretly  remained  loyal  to  Judaism.  In  the  latter  part  of  the  17th 
Century,  however,  suspicion  was  attracted  towards  them,  and  David  de  Sola  (who 
to   elude  his  persecutors  had  assumed  the  name  of  Bartolome)  was  apprehended,

and  charged  witli  having  relapsed  into  Judaism.  AUhoiigh  placed  under  the  most 
fearful  tortures  notliing  seems  to  have  been  proved,  as  lie  was  allowed  to  afterwards 
go  free  ;  but  he  was  physically  broken  down  by  his  terrible  sufferings.  Escape  from 
the  country  by  a  suspect  was  then  extremely  difficult,  but  in  the  next  generation  his 
son,  .Aaron  de  Sola,  managed  to  secure  refuge  on  board  a  British  Man-of-War,  and  to 
make  good  his  escape  with  his  family  to  Kngland  ;  not,  however,  before  two  of  his 
relatives  had  been  imprisoned,  tortured  rnd  contKained  to  death  at  an  auto  da  Fc,  by 
the  Inquisition,  for  secret  adherence  to  jud.iism. 

It  was  in  1749,  that  Aaron  de  .Sola  lied  with  his  wife  and  family  to  Kngland,  and 
now  that  they  were  freed  from  the  terrors  of  the  Inquisition  they  openly  avowed  once 
more  their  103'alty  to  the  faith  of  their  fathers,  l-'rom  Kngland  they  took  i)assagc  for 
Holland,  where  they  rejoined  their  relatives,  and  taking  up  their  residence  in 
Amsterdam  they  soon  again  rose  to  distinction  in  the  various  learned  professions. 

Previously  to  this — in  the  year  i690--()nc  of  the  preceding  generation,  Isaac 
de  Sola,  had  settled  in  London,  and  had  acquired  a  high  reputation  in  the  Hebrew 
community  there  as  an  eloquent  preacher  and  author.  Several  volumes  of  his  works 
are  still  extant. 

Four  sons  had  accompanied  Aaron  de  Sola  in  his  flight  from  Lisbon  in  1749,  of 
whom  the  eldest,  David,  was  the  great-grandfather  of  the  Dr.  Abraham  de  Sola  who 
forms  the  chief  subject  of  this  sketch.  The  youngest  of  Aaron  de  Sola's  sons,  Dr. 
Benjamin  de  Sola,  attained  to  a  foremost  ])lace  among  the  practitioners  of  the  last 
century.  He  was  Court  Physician  to  William  V.  of  the  Netherlands,  and  was  the 
author  cf  a  large  number  of  medical  works.  The  other  two  sons  of  Aaron  de  Sola 
settled  in  Curasao,  and  one  of  them  was  the  grandfather  of  General  Juan  de  Sola,  who 
became  so  distinguished  as  a  Ccnimander  of  ("avalry  under  Bolivar  and  Paez  when 
the  South  American  Slates  revolted  from  Spain.  He  took  part  in  the  decisive  battle 
of  Carabobo,  and  led  the  charge  on  Puerto  Cabello  when  that  city  was  stormed  by 
Paez,  receiving  a  sabre-wound  during  the  fight.  After  the  restoration  of  ])eace  he 
held  important  public  offices  during  the  Paer.  regime. 

The  Reverend  Abraham  de  Sola,  LL.D.,  was  born  in  London,  England,  on  the 
i8th  September,  1825.  His  father,  David  Aaron  de  Sola,  was  Senior  Minister  of 
the  Portuguese  Jews  of  London,  to  which  city  he  had  been  called  from  Amsterdam, 
and  was  eminent  as  a  Hebrew  author,  having  produced  among  many  other  works  an 
elegant  translation  of  the  Jewish  Forms  of  Prayer  ;  also,  in  conjunction  with  Dr.  Ra- 
phall,  an  edition  of  Genesis,  very  valuable  to  Biblical  students  on  account  of  its 
comiTientaries  and  copious  notes,  and  the  first  English  translation  of  Eighteen 
Treatises  of  the  iT//V//«&lt;i.  His  moth  was  the  daughter  of  Dr.  Raphael  Meldola, 
Chief  Rabbi  of  the  Spanish-Jewish  congregations  of  Britain.  The  Meldolas  had 
given  eminent  Chief  Rabbis  to  Europe  for  twelve  generations.  Abraham  de  Sola 
received  careful  tuition  in  all  the  usual  branches  of  a  liberal  education.  He 
became  early  engrossed  in  the  study  of  Oriental  languages  and  literature  and  of 
theology,  and  continued  to  devote  his  attention  to  those  subjects  until  he  acquired 


GAZETTEER   OF   MONTREAL.  467 

that  profound  knowledge  of  tliem  whicli  subsequently  won  him  so  proninicnt  a 
place  among  scholars.  Having  been  offered  the  position  of  Rabbi  of  the  Spanish 
and  Portuguese  Jewish  Co:igi-egation  of  Montreal  he  accepted  the  call,  and  arrived 
in  this  city  in  the  beginning  of  1847,  ^^^^  here,  for  over  thirty-five  years,  he  conti- 
nued to  minister  to  the  spiritual  wants  of  his  people.  His  able  pulpit  discourses 
soon  attracted  attention.  Dr.  de  Sola's  abilities,  however,  were  not  destined 
to  be  confined  exclusively  to  his  oflicial  duties.  Before  leaving  London  he  had  been 
associated  in  the  editorial  work  of  a  Hebrew  journal,  T/ie  Voice  of  Jacobs  and  soon 
after  his  arrival  in  Canada  he  delivered  a  course  of  lectures  on  Jewish  history  before 
the  Mercantile  Literary  Association.  In  1848,  he  published  his  "  Notes  on  the  Jews 
of  Persia  Under  Mohammed  Siuih,"  and  also  "  A  History  of  the  Jews  of  Persia." 
Within  the  same  year  there  appeared  his  important  work  on  "  Scripture  Zoology." 
Soon  afterwards  he  published  his  "  Lectures  on  the  Mosaic  Cosmogony."  This  was 
followed  by  his  "  Cosmography  of  Peritsol,"  a  work  displaying  such  erudition  that  it 
gained  a  wide  circulation  in  Europe,  and  was  reprinted  there  in  several  languages. 
His  next  work,  "  A  Commentary  upon  Samuel  Hannagid's  Introduction  to  tne  Tal- 
mud," was  a  book  which  deservedly  attracted  much  attention,  owing  to  the  light 
which  it  threw  upon  an  interesting  portion  of  rabbinical  literature,  and  to  its  depth 
of  Talmudic  knowledge.  In  1853  he  published,  conjointly  with  the  Rev.  J.  J.  Lyons, 
of  New  York,  a  work  on  the  Jewish  Calendar  System,  chiefly  valuable  on  account  of 
its  excellent  prefatory  treatise  upon  the  Jewish  system  of  calculating  time. 

Dr.  de  Sola's  mastery  of  Semitic  languages  and  literature  early  attracted  the 
notice  of  our  learned  bodies,  and,  after  first  acting  as  lecturer,  he  was,  in  1853,  ap- 
pointed Professor  of  Hebrew  and  Oriental  Literature  at  McGill  University.  The 
high  abilities  which  he  displayed  as  occupant  of  this  chair  proved  the  wisdom  of 
the  appointment,  and  he  continued  to  hold  the  position  during  the   rest  of  his  life. 

For  some  time  Dr.  de  Sola  had  been  engaged  in  the  preparation  of  one  of  his 
most  important  productions,  "  The  Sanatory  Institutions  of  the  Hebrews."  The  work 
was  published  in  two  parts,  and  was  an  exhaustive  exposition  of  the  hygienic  laws  of 
the  Hebrews,  as  exhibited  in  both  Scriptural  and  rabbinical  writings,  critically  exam- 
ined in  the  light  of  modern  scientific  knowledge.  It  was  a  production  which  evinced 
how  deeply  the  author  had  penetrated  into  scientific  as  well  as  rabbinical  paths  of 
learning.  Shortly  afterwards  he  published  a  supplemental  work  to  it,  entitled 
"  Behemoth  Hatemeoth." 

The  prominence  to  which  Dr.  de  Sola  had  now  reached  among  men  of  letters 
led  McGill  Univerity  to  confer  upon  him  the  degree  of  LL.D.  in  1858. 

In  i860,  Dr.  Hall,  the  editor  of  The  British  American  Journal,  ^^sqX.qA  to 
physical  and  medical  science,  induced  Dr.  de  Sola  to  assist  that  publication  with  his 
pen,  and,  among  other  contributions,  his  series  of  articles  "  Upon  the  employment  of 
Anaesthetics  in  cases  of  Labor,  in  connection  with  Jewish  Law,"  call  for  particular 
mention. 

Dr.  de  Sola's  wide  range  of  studies  had  made  him  very  popular  both  as  a  public 
lecturer  and  as  a  contributor  to  various  literary  papers.  The  themes  of  some  of  these 


4^8  GAZETTKER  OF  MONTREAL. 

were  afterwards  much  amplified  by  him,  and  republished  in  their  elaborated  and 
completed  form.  At  comparatively  sliort  intervals  he  gave  to  the  public  his  works  on 
"  Scripture  Botany,"  "Sinaiiic  Inscriptions,"  "  Hebrew  Numismatics,"  "The  Ancient 
Hebrews  as  Promoters  of  the  Arts  and  Sciences,"  "The  Rise  and  Progress  of  the 
Great  Hebrew  Colleges,''  and  "  Philological  Studies  in  Hebrew  and  the  yVramaic 
Languages."  Turning  his  attention  again  to  Jewish  History,  he,  in  1869,  wrote  his 
interesting  "  Life  of  Shabethai  Tsevi,  the  False  Messiah."  The  following  year  he 
completed  his  "  History  of  the  Jews  of  Poland,"  and  in  1871  he  published  his  "  His- 
tory of  the  Jews  of  France." 

Dr.  de  Sola  closely  identified  himself  with  many  of  our  literary  and  scientific 
associations,  notably  with  the  Natural  History  Society,  in  which  he  was  an  active 
co-laborer  of  Sir  William  Dawson  and  Sir  William  liOgan.  He  was  for  manv  vears 
President  of  the  Society,  and  received  H.R.H.  Prince  Arthur  (afterwards  Duke  of 
Connaught)  when  that  prince  visited  the  Society  in  1870.  His  address  upon  "  The 
Study  of  Natural  Science,"  delivered  upon  that  occasion,  called  forth  a  letter  of 
approbation  from  Queen  Victoria. 

During  all  his  intense  literary  activity  Dr.  de  Sola  was  taking  a  very  prominent 
part  in  all  matters  affecting  the  Jewish  people.  His  mastery  of  Jewish  theology,  in 
all  its  branches,  had  earned  him  wide  renown  among  his  own  race,  and  had  gained 
him  a  high  place  among  the  very  foremost  Rabbis  of  tlie  day.  Convinced  that  the 
fences  which  orthodoxy  ])laced  around  the  citadel  of  his  ancestral  faith  were  the  best 
safeguards  against  disintegrating  forces,  die  upholders  of  Historical  Judaism  found 
in  him  an  able  and  powerful  champion.  Equally  noticeable  were  his  bold  attacks 
upon  the  weak  points  of  the  sceptical  school  of  modern  Biblical  criticism.  His 
intimate  knowledge  of  .11  those  branches  of  learning  which  bear  upon  this  subject 
made  him  particularly  foimidable  in  this  respect.  Tiie  Jewish  press  and  pulpit  and 
the  lecture  platform  were  the  vehicles  by  which  he  usually  reached  the  public  on 
these  subjects.  He  had,  indeed,  since  his  first  arrival  in  Canada  been  a  particularly 
active  contributor  to  Jewish  journals,  more  especially  to  the  Occident  of  Philadelphia, 
with  which  he  was  for  years  identified,  being  in  intimate  literary  relations  with  its 
editor,  the  gifted  Isaac  Leeser. 

Dr.  de  Sola's  ability  in  the  pulpit  led  to  his  frequently  being  invited  to  lecture 
in  the  United  States,  where  he  had  acquired  much  prominence  and  popularity.  On 
the  9th  of  January,  1872,  he  was  invited  by  General  Grant's  Government  to  perform 
the  ceremony  of  opening  the  United  States  Congress  with  prayer,  and  for  the  first 
time  was  witnessed  the  unique  spectacle  of  one  who  was  not  a  citizen  of  the  United 
Slates  nor  of  the  dominant  belief  officiating  at  the  opening  ceremonies  at  the  assem- 
bling of  Congress  at  Washington.  The  broad  liberality  of  this  act,  upon  the  part  of 
the  United  States  Government,  was  fraught  with  particular  significance  at  that  time, 
owing  to  the  fact  that  diplomatic  relations  between  Britain  and  the  United  States 
had  then  but  lately  been  strained  to  dangerous  tension  by  the  "  Alabama  Claims," 
and  this  high  compliment  to  a  British  subject  was  the  first  evidence  of  the  growth  of 


GAZKTTK.KR    Oh'   MONTRKAL.  469 

a  belter  feeling  between  the  two  countries.  Sir  Edward  Tliornton,  the  Ikitisli 
Ambassador  at  Washington,  formally  extended  to  Dr.  de  Sola  the  tlianks  of  the 
British  Government,  and  Mr.  Gladstone  —  then  Prime  Minister  —  also  personally 
communicated  his  satisfaction. 

Upon  the  death  of  Isaac  J.eeser,  Dr.  dc  Sola  i)uri;hased  tlie  stereotyped  plates 
of  his  works,  and  issued  a  new  edition  (jf  that  author's  translation  of  the  JJible 
according  to  Jewish  authorities.  He  also  brought  out  a  revised  translation  of  the 
Jewish  Forms  of  Prayer,  in  six  volumes,  based  upon  tiie  editions  of  D.  A.  dc  Sola 
(his  fatiier)  and  of  Leeser.  He  was  invited  to  become  llie  successor  of  Mr.  Leeser 
in  his  ministerial  office  bu*;  declined.    He  had  previously  refused  several  similar  offers. 

Dr.  de  Sola's  onerous  duties  were  at  this  time  further  increased  by  his  being 
offered  the  Chair  of  Hebrew  at  the  Montreal  Presbyterian  College,  and  later  on  he 
accepted  the  appointment  of  Lcctiner  in  Spanish  Literature  at  Mc(iill  University,  a 
literature  and  language  with  which  lie  was  specially  familiar,  and  to  whicii  he  was 
particularly  attached. 

But  such  incessant  application  to  work  could  not  but  prove  exhaustive,  and  liis 
naturally  vigorous  health  broke  down  under  the  strain.  A  year's  rest,  spent  in  Europe, 
proved  sufficiently  beneficial  to  enable  him  to  return  to  some  of  iiis  duties.  For  a 
while  he  also  resumed  his  contributions  to  tlie  Jewish  Press,  and  among  other 
interesting  writings  we  notice  his  ''  Yehuda  Alchari/i  and  tlie  JJook  Tachkemoni." 
In  1880  he  published  his  last  important  work,  "Saadia  Ha-Gaon,"  a  book  giving  a 
very  valuable  description  of  the  writings  and  life  of  one  of  tiie  greatest  of  Jewish 
philosophers,  and  also  containing  an  interesting  account  of  llie  Court  of  a  Prince  of 
the  Captivity. 

But  failing  health  was  destiiicd  now  to  clieck  for  ever  the  filj^rsof  his  active  pen, 
and  while  in  New  York,  on  a  visit  to  his  sister,  he  was  seized  by  an  attack  of  illness 
which  terminated  fatally  on  June  5th,  1SS2.  The  remains  were  brought  on  to  Mon- 
treal and  there  interred.  He  had  not  yet  completed  his  fifty-seventh  year  when  he 
passed  away. 

In  his  death  the  Hebrew  community  sustained  a  loss  whose  magnitude  could 
scarcely  be  over-estimated.  His  self-sacrificing  devotion  to  the  scivice  o^  his  race, 
his  ceaseless  labor  in  everytiiing  which  could  elevate  and  ])romole  both  their  moral 
and  intellectual  welfare,  his  quick  readiness  to  assuage,  with  kind  counsel  and  hel|), 
the  lot  of  those  in  adversity,  and  the  rare  talents  which  he  had  dis[)layed  in  his  mul- 
tifarious writings,  had  won  for  him  the  warmest  admiration  and  attachment  of  his 
people,  and  had  gained  him  a  reputation  among  them  that  was  world-witle.  His  loss, 
indeed,  was  scarcely  less  regretted  by  Gentile  than  by  Jew,  for  the  prominence  which 
his  scholarly  attainments  had  acquired  for  him  among  Canadian  litteratcnrs,  the 
active  role  which  he  had  for  thirty-five  years  played  in  our  various  learned  bodies, 
and  the  distinguished  position  which  he  held  in  our  leading  University,  achieved  for 
him  an  illustrious  place  among  Canada's  public  men. 

Dr.  de  Sola  was  married  in  1852  to  Esther  Joseph,  the  youngest  daugliter  of 
Henry  Joseph,  of  Berthier,  one  of  the  earliest  Jewish  settlers  in  this  country.  Of  his 
several  children,  the  eldest  son, the  Rev.  Meldola  de  So'a,  succeeded  him  as  Rabbi  of 
the  Spanish  and  Portuguese  Synagogue  of  Montreal,  and  another  son,  Mr.  Clarence  I. 
de  Sola,  is  general  manager  of  the  Belgian  Syndicate,  "  Comptoir  Bclgo-Canadien."

IIENKV  JOSKI'II, 

Who  figures  prominently  among  the  early  Canadian  Hebrew  colonists,  was  born  in 
England  in  1775,  and,  as  stated  in  our  sketch  of  the  Spanish  and  Portuguese 
Synagogue  (page  475),  was  induced  to  settle  in  Canada,  when  he  was  yet  a  mere 
youth,  by  his  uncle,  Ci)ininissary  Aaron  Hart.  In  those  days  Herthier  was  an  impor- 
tant distributing  i)oint,  owing  to  its  being  oijjjosite  Fort  William  Henry,  the  noted 
military  ))ost  at  the  mouh  of  the  Richelieu.  As  Henry  Joseph  had  connections  with 
the  Commissariat  of  this  division  he  took  up  his  abode  at  Jijrlhier.  Afterwards 
from  this  central  point  he  branched  out  as  a  very  extensive  trader,  both  west  and 
east,  establishing  one  of  the  largest  commercial  houses  in  that  part  of  the  country, 
and  venturing  into  undertakings  which  were  considered  particularly  enterprising  at 
that  time,  when  Canada's  trade  was  only  at  its  dawn.  He  was  the  first  one  to  charter 
Canadian  ships  direct  and  exclusively  for  Canadian  trade  with  England,  and  thus  he 
became  one  of  the  founders  of  Canada's  merchant  marine.  Among  the  vessels  he 
controlled  was  the  ship  liiui.  'ir,  which  brought  many  a  cargo  to  this  port.  He  was 
assisted  in  some  of  his  enterprises  by  his  brother,  Judah  Joseph.  The  latter,  how- 
ever, after  amassing  considerable  wealth,  returned  to  England.  Ui)on  the  outbreak 
of  the  War  of  1812-14,  Henry  Joscfih  once  more  joined  the  military  forces  and  saw 
active  service.  Subsecpient  to  this  he  became  a  dormant  partner  in  the  extensive 
mercantile  firm  established  in  Montreal  by  his  brother-in-law,  and,  upon  the  death  of 
the  latter,  he  decided  to  take  up  his  residence  in  this  city,  his  business  conriections 
here  having  become  so  important  as  to  render  this  change  of  domicile  necessary. 
But  shortly  after  his  removal  to  Montreal  there  occurred  that  terrible  outbreak  of 
cholera  of  1832,  which  devastated  Europe  and  America,  carrying  death  and  gloom 
to  many  a  house.  His  eldest  son,  Samuel,  was  stricken  down  by  the  fell  disease,  in 
Berthier.  Hastening  from  Montreal  to  his  dying  son's  bedside,  Henry  Joseph  was 
himself  seized  with  the  cjjidemic,  and  within  a  few  hours  died  from  it.  The  body 
was  afterwards  interred  at  Montreal.  His  death  occurred  on  the  21st  June,  1832. 
One  hundred  and  fifty-nine  deaths  took  place  that  same  day  in  Montreal  from 
this  dreadful  scourge.  Henry  Joseph  was  married  to  Miss  Rachel  Solomons,  a 
daughter  of  one  of  those  who  are  mentioned  among  the  first  Israelitish  settlers 
and  founders  of  the  Spanish  and  Portuguese  Hebrew  congregation.  Four  sons 
and  four  daughters  survived  him.  His  sons  were  J.  H.,  Abraham,  Jesse  and 
Gershom  Joseph,  all  of  whom  attained  to  prominence.  We  give  sketches  of  the 
careers  of  three  of  them  below,  but  it  is  out  of  our  province,  as  historians  of  Mont- 
real, to  give  any  extended  notice  of  the  life  of  the  second  named  son,  Abraham,  as 
the  latter  resided  in  Quebec,  and  that  duty  must  therefore  devolve  upon  the 
chronicler  of  the  ancient  capital.  We  may,  though,  observe  en  passant  that 
Abraham  Joseph  was  one  of  Quebec's  most  prominent  men,  and  among  the  many 
important  positions  occupied  by  him  we  remark  that  he  was  President  of  the 
Dominion  Board  of  Trade,  President  of  the  Stadacona  Bank,  a  director  of  the  Banque

NatioiKile  and  director  of  the  Quebec  and  Gulf  Ports  Steamship  Co.  He  also  sat 
in  (Quebec's  City  ('ouncil,  and  once  stood  for  mayor  of  that  city.  Of  the  four 
daughters  who  survived  Henry  Joseph,  the  eldest  was  married  to  Dr.  A.  M.  David 
and  the  youngest  to  the   Rev.  Dr.  Abraham  de  Sola.

Was  born  in  I^erthier,  but  removed  to  Montreal  when  his  fatiiertook  up  liis  residence 
liere  about  the  year  1S30.  While  occupied  with  his  own  extensive  business  aftiirs  he 
found  time  to  take  an  interest  in  many  jiublic  enterprises,  and  when  later  on  he 
retired  entirely  from  commercial  pursuits  he  still  continued  to  take  a  very  active 
part  in  a  number  of  our  most  important  ])ul)lic  undertakings,  notably  in  several  of 
our  fust  telegraph  companies,  railways  and  banks.  He  was  not,  though,  easily  to  be 
persuaded  to  accept  directorship,  although  frequently  pressed  to  do  so,  as  it  was 
always  a  i)rinciple  with  him  never  to  allow  his  name  to  api^ear  responsible  for  any 
enterprise  which  he  could  not  fully  control. 

Noticing  first  his  participation  in  the  introduction  cf  telegraph  lines  in  Canada,  it 
is  interesting  to  observe  that  he  was  one  of  theoriginal  group  of  thirty  who  organized 
thetirst  telegra;Mi  company  here,  and  was  also  one  of  those  that  built  the  first  line 
to  the  United  States  via  Plattsburgh.  He  was,  likewise,  partner  in  the  Newfoundland 
Telegra[)h  Compa.iy.  that  formed  the  last  link  in  the  first  Atlantic  Cable  line. 

Mr.  J.  H.  Joseph  also  very  materially  assisted  in  the  construction  of  some  of 
the  very  earliest  railroads  built  in  Canada.  He  was  one  of  those  who  were  connected 
with  the  Champhiin  Railroad  Company,  and  was  a  director  of  the  Branch  constructed 
in  the  United  States  to  Rouses  Point — continuing  to  be  a  large  stockholder  until  its 
final  absorption  by  the  Grand  Trunk.  He  was  also  one  of  a  half-a-dozen  merchants 
who  designed  and  constructed  a  railroad  from  Joliette  to  Rawdon,  in  continuation 
of  the  Lanoraie  and  Joliette  Road. 

Mr.  Joseph  largely  aided  in  the  formation  of  several  of  our  banks.  When  the 
Union  Bank  was  founded,  1,400  shares  of  stock,  which  had  been  allotted  for  Montreal, 
remained  unsubscribed,  and  he  took  these  up  to  further  the  successful  organization  of 
the  JJank.  He  was,  too,  one  of  the  original  stockholders  of  the  ]5ank  of  British  North 
America — a  certain  jjortion  of  whose  capital  was  allotted  to  Canada.  Originally 
one  of  the  largest  shareholders  of  the  Ontario  Bank,  he  grew  dissatisfied  with  the 
action  of  the  Head  Board,  then  in  Bowmanville,  and  he  expressed  his  disapproval  of 
their  course  by  disposal  of  all  his  stock.  Events  afterwards  justified  his  views.  He 
was  also  one  of  the  original  members  of  the  Provident  Savings  Bank,  but  his  indei)en- 
dence  and  foresight  showed  itself  here  also,  for,  disapproving  of  the  policy  pursued, 
he  withdrew  all  connection  with  it  long  before  it  met  with  the  unsuccess  which  he 
prophesied. 

Mr.  Joseph  was  for  many  years  closely  identified  with  and  the  largest  stock- 
holder in  the  Montreal  Elevator  Co.,  of  which  he  was  for  some  time  President. 
He  was  an  active  member  of  the  Montreal  Board  of  Trade,  and  was  Vice-President

when  Holton  and  Cramj)  wore  at  its  head.  He  was  ilic  originator  of  the  Port  Warden 
and  Harbor  Inspector's  offices,  and,  though  objected  to  by  many  at  tlie  time  as 
unnecessary,  exjiericnce  has  since  sliown  the  wisdom  of  their  establisliment. 

Mr.  Josepli  has  taken  considerable  interest  in,  and  is  a  hfe  member  of,  many  of 
our  important  institutions,  inchiding  the  (leiieral  Hospital,  the  Mercantile  IJbrary, 
the  Art  Association,  the  Mechanics'  Institute  and  the  Natunil  History  Society.  Of 
the  last  mentioned  he  has  been  Vice-President.  He  has  also  assisted  materially 
towards  the  growth  of  Montreal  l)y  liis  extensive  building  operations,  having  sin':e 
185.^  erected  more  buiUbngs  for  his  own  jiersonal  holding  than  any  other  citizen  ; 
wliile  of  public  buildings  lie  had  much  to  do  with  the  originating  of  the  Mercantile 
Library  building,  and  the  old  Merchants'  P^xchange. 

Apart  from  these  public  enter])rises  Mr.  j.  H.  Josc])h  has  always  taken  a  deep 
interest  in  all  political  cpiestions  affecting  this  country.  During  the  Rebellion  of 
T837-3S,  he  took  an  active  part,  and  was  entrusted  to  convey  dispatches  at  night 
between  Sir  John  Colborne  and  General  ^Vethe^all — then  in  command  at  Cham- 
bly  of  the  troops  on  the  Richelieu, — the  disiialches  being  hidden  in  the  leather 
linings  to  escape  risk  of  capture.  He  was  olhcer  in  a  regiment  regularly  enrolled 
under  Colonel  Dyer,  forming  part  of  the  battalions  employed  to  garrison  Hochelaga, 
Laprairie,  Chambly  and  St.  Johns  at  the  time  that  the  troops  were  despatched  to 
resist  the  attack  from  the  American  line  at  Lacollc. 

Always  an  active  ])olitician,  from  the  days  of  Lafontaine  and  IJaldwin,  he  was 
the  conftcre  of  Holton,  Kinnear,  John  Voiuig  and  Penny,  and  an  unwavering  Liberal 
until  the  General  Elections  of  1891.  Some  years  ago  he  was  invited  to  become  the 
Liberal  candidate  for  Montreal  A\\,'st.  but  declined.  He  also  rejected  overtures  to 
enter  the  Legislative  Council  of  this  Province,  refusing  always  to  be  bound  by  any 
party  shackles. 

Mr.  J.  H.  Joseph  is  married  to  the  niece  of  Rebecca  Gratz.  Two  sons  and 
several  daugliters  are  the  offspring  of  this  union,  the  sons  being  Mr.  Henry 
Joseph  and  Mr.  Horace  Joseph.  Miss  Gratz  was  a  woman  whose  lofty  character, 
benevolent  deeds  and  devoted  efforts  in  the  cause  of  education  made  her  one  of  the 
noblest  figures  in  Philadelphia  society  half  a  century  ago,  and  an  additional  interest 
is  attached  to  her  personality  from  the  fact  of  her  having  been  the  original  from 
whom  Sir  Walter  Scott  sketched  his  character  of  Rebecca  in  "  ivanhoe."  The 
incident  is  thus  related  in  Morais's  account  of  her  life  :  "  Washington  Irving  (who 
was  one  of  the  cotene  of  celebrities  who  formed  her  most  intimate  circle  of  friends) 
while  paying  a  visit  to  Sir  Walter  Scott,  at  his  home  in  Scotland,  learnt  from  the 
latter  that  his  novel  of  "Ivanhoe"  was  in  course  of  preparation,  and  that  a 
Jewish  female  character  would  be  introduced.  Whereupon  the  former  remarked 
that  he  knew  of  a  lady  who  would  suit  admirably.  He  proceeded  to  describe,  in 
glowing  terms,  Rebecca  Gratz,  her  acquirements  and  suavity  of  manners  and  her 
unyielding  devotion  to  Israel's  God.  Scott  attentively  listened  to  the  interesting 
narrative,  and  when  lie  had  finished  "  Ivanhoe,"  he  sent  the  first  copy  to  Irving, 
inquiring  whether  the  "Rebecca"  he  had  pictured  compared  with  the  pattern  given."

JESSE  JOSEPH, 

Who  has  so  long  occupied  so  prominent  a  place  among  our  public  men,  and  taken 
so  leading  a  part  in  the  administration  of  so  many  of  our  most  important  enterprises 
is  the  third  of  the  sons  who  survived  Henry  Joseph. 

He  was  born  at  Eerthier,  Inil  removed  to  Montreal  in  his  boyhood.  Here  he 
soon  displayed  those  great  business  talents,  and  that  inherent  capacity  for  organizing 
and  successfully  directing  large  public  undertakings  wiiich  have  so  distinguished  his 
entire  career.  Believing  that  commercial  relations  between  Canada  and  JJelgium 
could  be  advantageously  cultivated,  he  became  the  earliest  pioneer  of  commerce 
between  the  two  countries,  carrying  on  an  enormous  trade,  and  chartering  the  first 
vessels  that  were  ever  charged  with  cargoes  between  this  port  and  Antwerp.  The  large 
volume  of  business  that  has  since  been  developed  with  Belgium  is  to  be  credited  to  his 
initiative.  l''ew,  indeed,  of  our  merchants  ventured  upon  business  on  a  more  exten- 
sive scale,  or  did  more  to  extend  Canada's  commerce  at  that  time,  than  Jesse  Joseph. 

Retiring  from  commercial  pursuits  in  1864,  when  he  was  yet  a  young  man,  he 
devoted  his  attention  to  the  many  jjublic  companies  with  which  he  had  become 
closely  associated,  and  which  he  had,  by  his  personal  efforts  as  well  as  with  his 
capital,  largely  assisted  in  furthering.  His  sound  judgment,  high  executive  abilities 
and  mature  experience,  rendered  his  co-operation  on  any  Board  of  the  highest  value  ; 
and  hence  he  has  figured  prominently  in  the  directorship  of  many  of  Canada's  most 
successful  enterprises. 

Since  1877,  Mr.  Jesse  Jose))h  has  been  President  of  the  Montreal  Cas  Company, 
one  of  the  strongest  companies,  financially,  in  Canada.  During  his  administration 
its  business  has  made  enormous  strides,  having  more  than  quadrupled  in  volume  in 
fifteen  years.  As  far  back  as  1863,  he  was  elected  one  of  its  Directors,  and  thus  for 
almost  thirty  years  he  has  taken  a  most  important  part  in  the  administration  of  its 
affairs. 

He  has  also  been,  since  1884,  President  of  tiie  Montreal  Street  Railway  Com- 
pany, having  seven  years  before  that  date  been  elected  one  of  its  Board  of  Directors. 
Under  his  presidency  it  has  developed  to  very  large  proportions,  being  now  one  of 
the  most  extensive  tram  roads  on  this  Continent,  having  over  thirty-five  miles  of  track 
at  present  in  operation. 

Among  the  large  number  of  other  public  enterprises  with  which  he  has  been 
connected,  we  remark  that  he  has  been  for  many  years  a  Director  of  the  Montreal 
Telegraph  Co.,  and  also  one  of  the  original  Directors  of  the  People's  Telegraph  Co. 
He  has  likewise  been  a  member  of  the  Board  of  the  Banque  Nationalc. 

Mr.  Jesse  Joseph  has  for  over  forty  years  been  Consul  here  for  Belgium,  and  was 
the  first  one  appointed  to  that  ofiice  in  Canada.  In  recognition  of  his  distinguished 
services  in  inaugurating  relations  with  this  country,  he  was  some  years  ago  created 
a  Chevalier  (Knight)  of  the  Order  of  Leopold  by  the  King  of  the  Belgians,  and  in 
1890  he  was  further  honored  by  the  King  conferring  upon  him  the  Dhoration 
Civique  of  the  First  Class.

GEKSHOM  JOSEPH. 

Mr.  Gershom  Joseph,  M.A.,  B.C.L.,  is  the  youngest  son  of  Mr.  Henry  Joseph  of 
Berthier.  Designed  for  a  professional  career,  he  was  sent  at  on  early  age  to  Upper 
Canada  College,  Toronto,  to  be  educated,  and  from  there  to  Toronto  Uni^'ersity. 
After  passing  through  the  course  in  Arts,  and  receiving  tlie  degree  of  M.x^.,  he  took 
to  Law,  and  graduated  as  B.C.L.  In  addition  he  studied  for  five  years  with  Chief 
Justice  Meredith  and  Judge  Mondelet.  After  a  long  sojourn  in  Europe,  he  returned 
here  and  began  the  practice  of  his  profession.  He  had  risen  to  a  very  high  position 
in  the  legal  fraternity  when  the  California  Gold  Fever  broke  out  in  1849,  '^^^  '^^ 
became  seized  with  a  desire  to  try  his  fortune  on  the  Pacific  Coast.  Casting  aside 
his  lucrative  profession,  he  was  among  the  earliest  to  seek  the  new  field  of  enter|)rise 
offered  at  that  time  by  California.  Here  his  experiences  were  very  varied,  and 
spiced  with  adventure,  but  our  limits  prevent  our  relating  more  than  one  or  two 
incidents.  Having  succeeded  in  accumulating  a  very  large  sum,  he  had  some  60,000 
dollars  of  this  in  go'd  dust  placed  in  a  safe  in  a  building,  standing,  like  many 
other  San  P'rancisco  structures  then,  on  piles  in  the  water.  A  notorious  gang  of  des- 
peradoes, known  as  "  the  Hounds,"  who  were  the  terror  of  San  Francisco  at  that 
time,  ascertained  about  this  gold,  and  managed  to  make  away  with  all  by  getting 
imder  the  building  in  a  boat  at  low  tide.  The  depredations  of  this  band  gave  rise 
to  the  establishment  of  the  celebrated  Vigilance  Committee.  Again  setting  to  work, 
he  had  once  more  accumulated  a  good  deal  of  property  when  the  great  conflagration, 
which  swept  over  San  Francisco  in  185 1,  destroyed  nearly  all.  For  more  than  a 
decade  after  this  he  resided  in  San  Francisco,  engaged  in  various  enterprises, and  for 
a  time  associated  in  business  with  Mr.  Belleau,  the  cousin  of  our  former  Lieut'.- 
Governor,  Sir  Narcisse  F.  Belleau.  He  was  also  while  in  California  the  special 
correspondent  of  the  '■'Herald.'' 

In  1861,  Mr.  Joseph  married  Miss  Celine  Lyons,  and  in  1863,  he  returned  to 
Montreal  and  resumed  the  practise  of  law,  entering  into  partnership  with  Mr.  Rouer 
Roy,  the  present  City  Attorney.  The  firm  was  one  of  the  best-known  legal  firms 
here  during  the  6o's. 

Mr.  Gershom  Joseph  is  now  one  of  the  oldest  members  of  the  Bar,  there  being 
only  two  or  three  at  present  practicing  that  ante-date  his  admission.  He  has  occupied 
various  honorary  positions  in  some  of  our  institutions,  and  has  been  at  two  different 
periods  President  of  the  Corporation  of  Spanish  and  Portuguese  Jews,  a  position 
which  he  still  holds.

THE  SPANISH   AND  roRTUGUESK  SYNAGOGUE, 

The  Congregation  of  Spanish  and  Ponuguese  Jews,  "  Shearilh  Israel,"  to  which 
we  liave  referred  in  our  sketch  of  Dr.  de  SuUi's  hfe,  has  a  most  interesting  history. 
There  are  probably  not  more  tlian  three  or  lour  (e.vish  congregations  now  existing 
in  America  whose  record  dates  as  far  bai  k  as  theirs.  Many  generations  have  jjassed 
away  since  it  was  foinided  by  a  small  band  &lt;-.'  Sephardic  Jews,  who  entered  Canada  at 
the  time  wlien  France  and  England  were  iockcil  in  tlieir  final  struggle  for  supremacy 
on  this  Continent. 

Among  the  officers  of  Amherst's  invading  army  was  Co/fimissaty  Aaron  HurV 
He  became  attached  to  the  divisions  of  infantry  under  General  Haldimand's  com- 
mand in  1760,  and  was  stationed  at  Thiee  Rivers,  where  he  rendered  good  service 
to  the  British  arms.  He  had  come  originally  from  London,  where  he  was  born 
ia  1724.  After  the  close  of  the  war  he  became  Seigneur  of  Becancour.  About 
the  same  time  there  arrived  in  Montreal  Lazarus  David,  who  by  his  public  spirit  and 
enterprise  attained  to  a  position  of  considerable  prominence  in  the  community* 
These  were  among  the  first  Israelites  known  to  have  taken  u\)  a  permanent  residence 
in  Canada.  Within  the  decade  following  the  fall  of  Quebec  there  arrived  iiere  a 
number  of  Jewish  settlers,  among  whom  were  Andrew  Hays,  David  Salesby  Franks, 
Jacob  de  Maurera,  Elias  Seixas,  Levi  Solomons,  Uriah  Judah,  Fernandez  da  Fonseca, 
Joseph  Bindona  and  Emanuel  de  Cordova.  Mjst  of  them  were  men  of  means.  Some 
were  occupied  in  large  enterprises,  and  three  or  four  were  attached  to  the  army. 

In  1768,  this  little  band  of  early  Hebrew  ];ioiieors  formed  themselves  into  a  con- 
gregation, and  took  the  name  of  "  Shearith  Israel'''  (Remnant  of  Israel),  and  thus 
was  founded  the  Spanish  and  Portuguese  congregation,  which  still  bears  that  name ; 
for  tlie  first  colonists  being  nearly  all  descended  from  Hebrews  of  Spain  and  Portugal 
adhered  to  the  impressive  and  venerable  ritual  of  the  6&gt;/*//&lt;ir&lt;//&lt;:(S})anish)  Jews,  a  ritual 
to  which  the  descendants  of  these  founders  have  ever  since  clung  with  unswerving 
loyalty. 

After  worshipping  for  nine  years  ir  a  room,  they,  in  1777,  built  the  first  syna- 
gogue ever  erected  in  Canada,  upon  a  piece  of  property  between  Notre  Dame  and 
St.  James  street,  near  the  Court  House,  and  belonging  to  the  David  family.  It  was 
a  low  stone  building  with  a  red  roof,  and  was  surrounded  by  a  high  stone  wall. 

\\\  1775,  they  purchased  a  piece  of  ground  near  the  present  Dominion  Square 
for  a  cemetery,  and  the  first  one  interred  was  Lazarus  David,  who,  born  in  1734, 
had  died  during  the  year  following  the  purchase  of  this  ground.  The  original 
headstone,  bearing  the  date  22nd  October,  1776,  is  still  to  be  seen  standing  in  the 
present  ground,  at  the  side  of  a  newer  one  that  replaced  it,  the  bodies  interred  in 
the  Old  ground  having  been  removed  to  the  new  one  when  the  latter  was  purchased. 

The  number  of  men  belonging  to  this  congregation  who  attained  to  prominence 
was  remarkably  large.  A  near  relative  of  David  Salesby  Franks  was  the  celebrated 
Colonel  Isaac  Franks,  who,  having  fixed  his  residence  about  this  time  in  Philadelphia, 
joined  the  Revolutionary  Army  after  the  Battle  of  Lexington,  and  became  Aide-de-

Camp  to  (leorge  Wasliington.  It  was  at  his  house  tliat  Wasliington  took  up  his 
quarters  wlicn  he  came  to  Philadelphia  to  atiend  the  assemhling  uf  the  first  Congress 
of  the  then  newly-born  United  States.  Jacob  Franks,  his  nephew,  was  also  dis- 
tinguished, nearly  a  century  ago.  for  his  success  in  establishing  trading  posts  in  the 
Hudson  i]ay  Territory,  penetrating  into  the  very  heart  of  the  wild  unsettled  North 
West  in  his  enterprises.  Another  one  (jf  the  earl&gt;  Jewish  colonists,  distinguished 
for  enterprises  of  somewhat  similar  character,  was  Henry  Joseph.  He  had  been 
induced  to  settle  here  by  his  uncle,  the  Commissary  Hart  referred  to  above.  In  our 
notice  of  the  Jose])h  family  we  refer  more  fully  to  the  very  noteworthy  jjart  he 
played  in  public  affairs. 

Of  the  early  members  of  the  Spanish  and  rortugucse  Synagogue  one  of  the  most 
eminent  was  David  David,  who  was  one  of  the  sons  of  the  above-mentioned  Lazarus 
David.  He  was  born  in  1764,  and  was  one  of  the  wealthiest,  most  philanthropic  and 
most  public-spirited  of  Montreal's  citizens  nearly  a  century  ago.  He  was  one  of  the 
chief  founders  of  the  Bank  of  Montreal  in  i&lt;So8,  and  one  of  the  Directors  of  its  first 
Board.  There  was  sc  rcely  an  important  cnterj)rise  at  that  time  in  Montreal  in  which 
he  did  not  play  a  leadir.g  role,  and  liis  benevolent  and  self-sacrifi„ing  spirit  made  him 
one  of  the  most  esteemed  and  most  prominent  of  our  public  men. 

In  those  days  the  Jews  still  labored  under  certain  political  disabilities  in  most 
countries,  and  although  in  Canada  the  laws  were  much  more  favorable  to  them  than 
in  other  i)arts  of  the  Empire,  yet  their  right  to  sit  in  Parliament  had  never  been 
defined.  In  1807,  the  question  of  their  jiolitical  status  was  suddenly  raised  by  the 
election  in  Three  Rivers  of  Mr.  Ezekiel  Hart — son  of  Commissary  Aaron  Hart — as 
member  of  the  Legislature.  Having  declined  to  take  the  oath  on  the  faith  of  a 
Christian,  in  the  usual  way,  the  Clerk  permitted  him  to  take  it  in  the  Jewish  form, 
and  with  head  covered.  The  majority  of  the  House,  influenced,  it  is  said,  more  by 
political  partizanship  than  by  any  actual  feeling  of  religious  intolerance,  objected, 
and  declared  the  seat  vacant.  After  an  exciting  scene  he  was  compelled  to  withdraw, 
and  the  election  was  declared  null.  Ezekiel  Hart  again  appealed  to  the  people  and 
was  again  elected,  defeating  three  other  candidates  by  heavy  majorities,  but  once 
more  he  was  prevented  from  taking  his  seat,  and  a  bill  was  brought  in  to  disqualify 
Jews  from  being  eligible  to  a  seat  in  the  House  of  Assembly.  On  the  15th  May, 
1809,  the  bill  was  to  have  come  up  for  its  third  reading  when  the  Governor  General, 
Sir  James  H.  Craig,  highly  displeased  with  the  measure,  in  angry  and  indignant 
terms  dissolved  the  House.  "  You  have  dissipated  your  time,"  said  he,  "  in  passing 
"  acts  which  appear  to  be  unconstitutional  unfringements  of  the  rights  of  the  subject, 
"  and  repugnant  to  the  very  letter  of  the  statute  of  the  Imperial  Parliament  under 
"  which  you  hold  your  seats  :  and  to  have  been  matured  by  proceedings  which  amount 
"  to  a  dereliction  of  the  first  principles  of  natural  justice."  A  struggle  followed  this 
dissolution,  but  it  was  not  till  1831  that  all  disqualifications  were  removed,  by  a 
formal  Act  passed  that  year.  It  is  a  noteworthy  fact  that  Canada  extended  full  poli- 
tical rights  to  the  Jews  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century  sooner  than  the  mother 
country.

The  affairs  of  the  congregation  having  got  into  a  rather  unsatisfactory  condition, 
and  the  old  Synagogue  building  near  the  Court  House  having  been  aliandoncd,  an 
earnest  api)eal  for  reorganization  was  issued  on  the  24tii  July,  1826,  signed  by  V&gt;en- 
jamin  Hart.  Steps  were  taken  to  raise  the  necessary  funds  for  a  new  building,  but 
some  time  paused  before  tangible  results  were  attained.  Meanwhile  the  congregation 
met  lor  worship  in  a  room  provided  by  Mr.  Benjamin  Hart  off  his  residence  at  the 
south-west  corner  of  St.  Helen  and  Recollet  streets.  Benjamin  Hart  was  one  of  the 
sons  of  Commissary  Aaron  Hart.  He  had  removed  to  Montreal  from  Three  Rivers 
years  previously,  and  was  at  this  time  one  of  tlv^  most  active  members  of  the  Si)anish 
and  Portuguese  Synagogue.  The  fact  that  the  residence  of  a  gentleman  of  means 
was  then  situated  in  St.  Helen  street  is  interesting  ao  showing  what  a  transformation 
has  talcen  place  in  .Montreal  since  that  time. 

Steps  were  taken  in  1831  and  1832  to  have  the  formalities  required  by  Legislative 
Acts  now  properly  complied  with  by  the  congregation. 

On  the  30th  June,  1835,  the  congregation  jjurchased  a  piece  of  land  facing  upon 
Chenneville  street  and  Lagauchetiere  street,  north-east  corner,  and  began  the  erec- 
tion of  a  Synagogue  thereon.  The  corner-stone  was  laid  by  M.  E.  David,  the  grandson 
of  Lazarus  David  and  nephew  of  David  David.  For  fifty-two  years  the  congregation 
worshipped  within  the  walls  of  this  edifice.  It  was  a  neat  stone  structure  with  a 
Doric  fagade,  and  a  chaste  and  dignified  interior.  The  building  was  planned  and  its 
erection  superintended  by  Moses  J.  Hays,  the  son  of  that  Andrew  Hays  whom  we 
have  mentioned  among  the  founders  of  the  congregation.  He  was  a  man  of  consider- 
able prominence,  whose  restless  spirit  of  enterprise  led  to  his  originating  many 
important  public  improvements.  It  was  he  who  first  established  Water  Works  in 
Montreal,  and  managed  them  for  many  years.  He  was  also  for  some  time  Chief 
Commissioner  of  Police.  It  is  a  noteworthy  fact  that  another  Israelite,  Jacob  Kuhn, 
was  Chief  Commissioner  of  Police  as  far  back  as  1778. 

In  the  erection  of  the  Chenneville  street  building,  the  congregation  was  largely 
assisted  by  the  munificence  of  Mrs.  Frances  Michaels,  the  sister  of  David  David, 
whose  generous  gift  of  a  considerable  sum  of  money  greatly  facilitated  the  completion 
of  the  work.  Mrs.  Michaels  had  then  become  possessed  of  that  piece  of  the  David 
family's  property  upon  which  the  congregation  had  been  permitted  to  erect  their  first 
building. 

It  is  a  noteworthy  fact  that  both  during  the  War  of  1812-14  and  the  Rebellion 
of  1837-38  we  find  a  number  of  members  of  "  Shearith  Israel"  acting  as  officers 
of  British  troops  and  rendering  important  assistance  to  the  Government.  We  refer 
more  particularly  to  members  of  the  David,  Joseph,  Hart  and  Hays  families. 

The  first  regidar  Rabbi  of  the  Montreal  Spanish  and  Portuguese  Synagogue  was 
the  Rev.  J.  R.  Cohen,  who  came  to  Montreal  in  1778,  and  after  being  here  for  some 
while  removed  to  Philadelphia,  where  he  became  minister  of  the  Portuguese  congre- 
gation "  J/"//^t/^  Israel"  there.  After  his  departure,  Mr.  Myer  Levy  temporarily 
officiated,  and  after  him  Mr.  Isaac  Valentine.    Upon  the  completion  of  the  Chenne- 


47?  GAZETTEER   OF    MONTREAL. 

ville  Street  building  the  Rev.  David  Piza  was  appointed  Rabbi.  He  held  office  for 
several  years  and  then  returned  to  England,  where  he  had  been  appointed  to  the 
Bevis  Marks  Synagoj^ue  of  London.  In  1846,  the  Rev.  Dr.  Abraham  de  Sola  was 
elected  Rabbi,  and  for  nearly  thirty-six  years  this  eminent  man  guided  the  destinies 
of  the  congregation  with  a  sway  that  well  attested  his  powerful  influence  over  iiis 
flock.  His  brilliant  career,  which  cast  so  much  lustre  upon  the  name  of  Hebrew  in 
Canada,  has  been  fully  described  by  us  elsewhere. 

During  its  earlier  years  the  congregation  was  unincorporated  ;  out  after  a  while 
Acts  were  passed  affecting  it,  and,  in  1846,  a  new  Act  of  Incorporation  was  secured, 
this  having  become  necessary  owing  to  the  formition,  that  year,  of  another  Jewish 
congregation  here.  This  second  congregation,  however,  was  very  short-lived,  and  it 
was  not  until  between  1858  and  i860,  nearly  a  century  after  the  formation  of  the 
Portuguese  congregation,  that  a  second  Hebrew  congregation  was  permanently  estab- 
lished here,  by  the  foundation  at  this  latter  date  of  the  present  German  and  Polish 
congregation — made  necessary  by  the  immigration  at  this  time  of  a  number  of  Polish 
and  German  Jews,  who  now  availed  themselves  of  the  Act  of  1846. 

Among  the  men  who  held  office  and  figure  prominently  in  the  affairs  of  the 
Spanish  and  Portuguese  Synagogue,  during  or  about  the  time  of  Dr.  Abraham  de  Sola's 
long  pastorate,  we  observe  many  well-known  and  honored  names.  There  was  Dr. 
A.  H.  David  (grandson  of  Lazarus  David),  Dean  of  the  Faculty  of  Medicine  at  Bishop's 
College,  whose  notable  life  we  have  chronicled  elsewhere.  (See  page  48c.)  He 
occupied  in  turn  almost  every  lay  office  in  the  congregation,  and  was  several  times 
its  president.  VVe  also  remark  Mr.  J.  H.  Joseph  acting  as  honorary  treasurer  for 
years.  A  very  conspicuous  place  is  held  in  the  annals  of  the  congregation  at 
this  time  by  Samuel,  Goodman  and  William  Benjamin,  who  were  such  familiar  and 
popular  figures  in  Montreal  over  a  generation  ago.  They  all  held  the  highest  offices 
in  the  gift  of  "  Shearith  Israel!^  Samuel  Benjamin  was  for  some  time  a  member  of 
the  City  Council  of  Montreal.  Mr.  Jesse  Joseph,  too,  has  for  nearly  half  a  century 
figured  among  the  most  prominent  and  most  important  lay  officers  of  the  Spanish  and 
Portuguese  Synagogue,  and  his  ever-ready  support  of,  and  deep  interest  in,  everything 
tending  to  promote  its  welfare  has  conduced  very  much  towards  its  prosperity.  Among 
other  staunch  supporters  in  years  gone  by  were  Mr.  Alexander  Levey,  for  some  time 
president ;  the  venerable  Gottschalk  I.  Asher,  who  passed  away  some  while  ago  at 
the  patriarchal  age  of  96  years,  and  Mr.  A.  E.  Cohen  and  Mr.  Louis  Davis, — the 
last  mentioned  being  yet  in  office.  Another  officer  who  has  long  and  loyally  worked 
for  the  best  interests  of  the  congregation  is  Mr.  Israel  Rubenstein,  the  present  Par- 
nas  (ecclesiastical  warden).  A  number  of  the  descendants  of  the  first  settlers  still 
figure  among  its  members,  among  whom  we  notice  Mr.  Gerald  E.  Hart,  the  author  of 
"The  Fall  of  New  France."  Our  limits  prevent  the  continuation  of  a  list  that 
might  be  much  prolonged.  We  will  not,  though,  omit  referring  to  Mr.  Jacob  L. 
Samuel,  who  for  upwards  of  a  quarter  of  a  century  has  been  honorary  secretary,  and 
whose  indefatigable  and  faithful  services  have  been  as  valuable  as  they  have  been 
unostentatious.

Tlie  death  of  Dr.  Abralinm  de  Sola,  in  1882,  led  to  tlie  election  of  his  son,  ilic 
Rev.  iMeldohi  de  Sola,  as  Rabbi  of  the  Spanish  and  V^jiuiguese  Synagogue.  As  a 
preaclier,  the  Rev.  Meldola  de  Sola  is  earnest,  forcible  and  Ihient,  and  he  is  a  zealous 
and  conscientiou.s'  worker  in  the  field  whicii  he  has  chosen;  laboring  steadily  in  UK- 
Jewish  press,  as  well  as  in  the  pulpit,  to  advance  the  cause  of  Piistorical  Judaism  as 
handed  down  to  the  House  of  Israel  by  their  forefathers. 

In  1883,  a  movement  was  inaugmated  in  ilu»  congregation  towards  the  erection 
of  a  more  commodious  .'^ynagogut',  and,  at  a  general  meeting  of  its  members,  held  in 
the  autumn  of  tliat  year,  a  committee  was  appointed  to  select  a  suitable  site,  and  to 
receive  offers  for  the  old  property  ;  but  it  was  not  until  the  close  of  1886  that  suf- 
ficient funds  were  collected  to  proceed  with  the  work.  In  the  spring  of  1887,  '^  pice 
of  property  was  purchased  on  Stanley  street,  above  St.  (Catherine,  and  the  work  of 
erecting  the  new  building  was  immediately  begun.  Tlie  JJuilding  Committee  was 
composed  of  Messrs.  Jesse  Joseph,  Louis  Davis,  Clarence  I.  de  Sola,  Jacob  I^. 
Samuel,  Horace  Jose])h,  Israel  Rubenstein,  and  the  Rev.  M.  de  Sola,  ex  officio,  'i'he 
plans  adopted  were  "  signed  by  Mr.  Clarence  I.  de  Sola,  who  directed  the  work  of 
erection  throughout,  .r.d  to  whose  energies  was  due  much  of  the  success  of  the 
undertaking.  The  corner  stone  was  laid  in  September,  1887,  by  Mr.  Gershom 
Joseph,  and  on  the  31st  August,  1890,  the  edifice  was  completed  and  dedicated  amid 
imposing  ceremonies. 

The  building  is  a  most  attractive  place  of  worship,  and  is  of  peculiar  interes 
from  an  artistic  point  of  view,  owing  to  its  design  bring  based  upon  the  best  traditions 
of  what  is  known  of  Jewish  architecture — being  a  combination  of  the  massive  and 
imposing  forms  of  Ancient  Egypt  with  the  graceful  outlines  and  luxuriant  features  of 
Oriental  Art — a  cimibination  at  once  chaste  and  elegant.  Its  noble  colonnades,  its 
beautiful  ark  of  mahogany  and  marble,  the  strict  correctness  of  its  forms,  and  the 
harmonious  tones  of  its  coloring,  all  unite  in  producing  a  most  pleasing  and  impres- 
sive effect,  while  the  markedly  pronounced  Jewish  characteristics  which  predominate 
throughout  the  entire  edifice  make  it  stand  distinct  in  style  from  any  other  place  of 
worship  in  the  city,  and  give  it  an  individuality  appropriately  in  keeping  with  the 
striking  individuality  of  the  Peculiar  People  who  worship  within  its  walls. 

Shortly  before  the  completion  of  the, building — during  the  Legislative  Session  of 
1889-go — the  congregation  received  a  new  Act  of  Incorporation,  amending  various 
points  of  the  previous  Acts.  It  was  framed  by  two  of  its  members,  Mr.  G.  Joseph^ 
B.C. L.,  and  Mr.  Lewis  A.  Hart,  B.C.L.  The  latter  was  for  some  years  Lecturer  on 
Notarial  Practice  at  McGill.

A.  II.  DAVID,  Ml). 

Aaron  Hart  David  was  the  second  son  of  ilic  kite  Samuel  David,  Esq.,  niercliant. 
wlu)  Wiis  born  in  Montreal  in  1766.  Dr.  David  was  born  in  this  city  on  the  9th 
October,  1S12.  He  was  i)arlly  educated  in  Montreal  and  jjartly  at  Round  Hill 
School,  Northampton,  Mass.,  under  tiie  cliarge  of  the  Historian,  the  Hon.  Mr. 
JJancroft,  and  while  there  had  the  honor  of  being  presented  by  Mr.  JJancroft  to  llie 
late  General  Lafayette  as  a  Canadian,  and  speaking  French  ;  who  shook  hands  with 
him,  wiien  he  visited  that  celebrated  school. 

He  commenced  studying  Medicine  in  January,  1830,  in  Montreal,  and  in  1833 
proceeded  to  Edinburgh  to  comi)lete  liis  studies.  He  became  a  Licentiate  of  the 
Royal  College  of  Surgeons  m  1834,  and  graduated  in  the  University  of  that  city  in 
1835,  i^ftcr  which  he  returned  to  Montreal  and  commenced  practice,  where  he  re- 
mained to  his  death.  He  was  Professor  of  Practice  of  Medicine  and  Dean  of  the 
Medical  l-'aculty  of  the  University  of  Bishop's  College,  and  a  D.C.L.  He  was 
president  of  the  Na  ■  al  History  Society  of  Mcjnlreal,  and  also  one  of  the  phyhi- 
cians  of  Montreal  Ceneral  Hospital  and  St.  Patrick's  Hosi)ilal,  and  enjoyed  a  large 
and  lucrative  practice  for  many  years. 

He  was  a  member  and  ex-governor  of  the  College  of  Physicians  and  Surgeons  of 
Lower  Canada, "and  a  life  member  of  the  Natural  History  Society  of  Montreal,  a 
corresponding  member  of  the  Literary  and  Historical  Society  of  Quebec,  an  extra- 
ordinary member  of  the  Royal  Medical  Society  of  Edinburgh,  a  member  of  the 
Medico-Chirurgical  Society  of  Montreal,  a  corresponding  member  of  the  Gyn;eco- 
logical  Society  of  Boston,  a  member  of  the  British  Association  for  the  Advancement 
of  Science,  a  member  of  the  Ameircan  Association  for  the  same,  a  member  and 
general  secretary  of  the  Canada  Medical  Association,  and  was  one  of  the  oldest 
medical  officers  of  the  Volunteer  Force  in  the  Dominion,  having  served  with  the

The  suhjecl  of  this  sketch,  and  qraiulfatlirr  ;)f  f.  (1.  Jones,  of  tliis  city,  was  born 
ill  l.iule  St.  James  street,  in  1761,  the  lirsl  llritish-horn  subject  in  Montreal,  and 
died  at  Iiis  son's  residence  (Hon.  Rol)crl  Jones  of  St.  John's)  in  1842,  in  the  eighty- 
second  yiar  of  liisage.  He  was  Ashes  Inspector,  and  precedeil  the  well-known  names 
of  I  )yde  iV  Major  in  that  office  ;  also  (^oljiiel  of  the  Militia  and  Volunteers  for  the  district 
of  Montnal.  It  was  he  who  gave  Colonel  I  )yde  his  first  commission  in  the  Voluntcrs. 
lie  owned  the  property  on  which  the  Merchants'  ISank  and  Nordheimer's  IMock  is  now 
erected.  When  (piite  a  youth,  he  was  entrusted  by  Lord  Howe  to  carry  over-land  most 
important  dispatches  to  Halifax  via  Canada,  which  he  successfully  performed  and  re- 
ceived tliedeiierars  thanks.  He  represented  the  County  of  Missisquoi  in  tlie  Parliament 
known  as  the  (lovernor  in  ('ouncil.  He  and  his  son,  C.  H.  Jones  (father  of  C.  (). 
Jones),  were  at  the  battle  of  IMattsbiirg,  the  latter  (not  sixteen)  acting  as  Aide-de- 
Camp  to  his  father.  A  powerful  field  glass  picked  u])  by  him  on  the  battle-field  is 
now  m  the  possession  of  Mr.  C.  (1.  Jones. 

The  father  of  Col.  Jones,  John  Jones,  Sen.,  came  with  his  Regiment  from  New 
York  to  Canada  in  1761 ,  to  take  possession  of  the  country  before  the  final  Cession. 
He  was  Quarter-master,  and  remained  about  a  week  in  Montreal,  during  which  time 
Col.  Jones  was  born.  The  Regiment  then  pushed  on  to  Quebec,  but  he  returned  after- 
wards with  his  Regiment  to  New  Y'oik,  and  was  appointed  Captain  of  Fort  l*",dward. 
When  the  Revolutionary  War  of  Independence  broke  out  he  tied  with  his  family  to 
Canada.  When  General  Eurgoyne's  Army  was  formed  in  Canada  against  the  Ameri- 
can Colonists,  he  was  ai)pointed  (^uartermaster-Cieneral,  and  "A'as  accomi)anied  in 
this  expedition  by  his  son,  John  Jones,  Jun.  Both  were  taken  i)risoners,  with  the 
whole  liritish  army,  at  Saratoga.  When  i)eace  was  declared  they  both  returned  to 
Canada,  John  Jones,  Sen.,  beii.g  appointed  to  the  charge  of  the  Military  Station  of 
William  Henry,  now  Sorel,  and  also  agent  for  the  Seigniory  of  W^illiam  Henry,  and 
receiving  a  grant  of  5,000  acres  of  land  as  a  U.  E.  Loyalist,  on  which  nearly  all  the 
town  of  Sorel  now  stands. 

John  Jones,  Sen.,  belonged  to  a  very  ancient  Welsh  family,  wdiose  descent  can 
be  traced  through  his  Crest  and  Arms  to  Nefydd  Hardd,  Lord  of  Nant  Conway, 
founder  of  the  VI  Noble  Tribe  of  North  Wales  and  Powis,  about  A.D.  goo.  The 
family  arc  also  connected  with  the  Jones  of  Foreman  Castle,  near  Cowbridge,  Gla- 
morgan, Wales,  the  Crest  and  Arms  being  similar. 

John  Jones,  Jun.,  or  Col.  Jones,  married  Mary  Magdalen  Heney  of  Lachine. 
Her  father  was  the  factor  of  the  North-West  Fur  Company's  Depot  there 
She  was  granddaughter  of  Charles  Rene  Lipailleur,  who  was  descended  from  Jean 
£,  Lafpailleur  of  Paris,  whose  son  was  procureur  du  Roi  et  Notaire  Royal  (French 
Noblesse)  of  Batiscan  (see  Tanguay,  Vol.  5).  It  was  owing  to  the  influence  of  Col. 
Jones  and  family,  that  L#pailleur,  the  Patriot  of  1837-38,  was  banished  to  Aus- 
tralia, instead  of  suffering  as  his  twelve  compatriots  did.     Five  sons  of  Col.  Jones

held  Commissions  during  the  Rebellion — two  as  Colonels  and  three,  C.  H.,  Edward  and 
T.  W.  Jones,  as  Captains  of  Cavalry.  'I'lic  troop  of  Thomas  W.  Jones,  of  which  he  was 
Captain,  was  a  splendid  Corps,  the  Queen's  Light  Dragoons,  which  showed  its  mettle  at 
the  Battle  of  St.  Eustache.  It  was  n.)t  disbanded  till  icSjO.  It  had  the  honor  of  being 
drilled  by  the  Earl  of  Cathcart,  who  declared  that  it  was  as  efficient  a  body  of 
Cavalry  as  any  in  Her  Majesty's  service.  Lord  Elgin  brought  about  their  disban- 
donment  because  they  would  not  charge  the  populace  at  the  riot  arising  from  the 
burning  of  the  Parliament  Buildings  in  1849.

SIMON  FRASER. 

Another  of  the  old  Monlrealers  of  the  last  century.  He  was  a  Roman  Catholic,  and 
came  from  Inverness.  Lord  Lovat  was  the  heid  of  the  Fiaser  Clan,  and  to  this 
sec'.ion  Simon  belonged.  He  will  ever  be  remembered  as  the  man  who  discovered 
the  River  which  bears  his  name,  the  I'raser  River  of  British  Columbia.  He  was 
one  of  the  most  energetic  agents  of  the  North  W^est  ComiKuiy,  and  striking  one  day 
the  banks  of  a  noble  river  he  hiuncheu  on  its  waters,  and  followed  it  to  its  mouth 
for  inmdreds  of  miles  until  il  fell  ir.'o  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Less  than  eighty  years 
passed,  when  the  great  Canadian  Pacific  Railway  has  followed  his  steps,  and  trains 
now  are  conveying  travellers  down  the  Fraser  River  Valley  to  Vancouver  through  a 
section  of  the  Dominion  which  will  yet  be  ])eoi^led  by  an  industrious  and  agricultural 
race.  He  was  one  of  those  whom  Lord  Selkirk  placed  in  arrest  for  their  part  in  the 
uprising  at  Fort  Garry,  and  when  Governor  Seniple  was  put  to  death  in  1816. 

REV.  ED.  BLACK,  D.D., 

Was  bom  at  Penninghatn,  Wigtonshire,  Scotland,  December,  1793.  Studied  there,  and 
latterly  in  1808  and  following  years  passed  his  curriculum  in  Edinburgh  University, 
and  in  1815.  was  licensed  to  preach.  He  was  assistant  to  his  fatlier  till  1822,  when  he 
determined  to  emigrate  to  Canada.  He  remained  in  Montreal,  and  for  twenty-three 
years  was  one  of  its  most  successful  preachers.  He  died  May  7th,  1845,  '"  '^'^'^  '"''^'^y" 
second  year  of  his  age.  He  had  married  into  the  Greenshields  family.  His  sister  had 
married  a  Pov.  Samuel  Richardson,  who  had  succeeded  the  Rev.  James  Black  in 
Penningbam.  Tiie  Author  of  this  work  was  connected  with  his  Church  for  one  year 
when  residmg  in  Wigtonshire,  and  a  few  years  after  was  comiected  with  St.  Paul's, 
Montreal,  for  five  years.  To  Dr.  Black  must  be  due  the  grand  church  of  St.  Paul's 
of  Montreal.  He  sowed  the  seed  and  the  result  is  now  seen — one  of  the  healthiest 
in  a  Christian  point  of  view,  and  financially  one  of  tlie  strongest  of  all  the  churches  in 
the  city,  and  overlooked  by  Rev.  James  Barclay,  M.A.,  whose  sketcii  is  given  else-

JOSEPH  ROV 

Was  born  at  Mascouche,  October,  1771.  His  father  was  one  of  the  early  farmers 
of  that  locality.  Tn  1790,  he  came  to  Montreal,  and  went  into  the  employ  of  Mr. 
Pasteur,  an  eminent  sculptor  of  that  time.  Determined  to  get  on  he  attended  a  night 
school,  and  thus  received  a  good  commercial  education.  In  1803,  he  opened  a  store 
at  the  corner  of  St.  Paul  street  and  Jacques  Cartier  square,  and  in  time  became  one 
of  the  great  merchants  of  Montreal.  In  1814,  he  was  chosen  against  the  celebrated 
James  Stuart,  then  Solicitor-General,  as  a  candidate  for  Montreal.  We  living  in  these 
last  years  of  the  century  must  look  back  and  find  that  at  this  pericd  great  things 
were  required  of  the  British  Empire.  He  had  thrown  down  the  gauntlet  against  the 
Government  and  against  such  a  man  as  James  Stuart.  As  a  writer  remarks  of  this 
period,  "  I'etat  sous  le  r^gne  de  la  terreur."  Governor  Craig  dissolved  the  Chamber 
the  second  time  in  the  short  space  of  six  months,  having  thrown  into  prison  those 
men  who  were  the  most  prominent  and  remarkable  against  his  administration.

Ls  the  grandson  of  Henry  Hobbs,  i77i,of  Staple  Hill  and  Stapleton,  Gloucester- 
shire, JMigland,  landed  proi)rietor,  carrying  on  business  in  collieries,  stone  quarries, 
flour  mills,  by  steam  and  water  power:  and  grand-nephew  of  Mr.  Mackay,  mer- 
chant and  shij)  owner  of  London,  England,  whose  vessels  traded  between  Lon- 
don and  Montreal  as  early  as  the  beginning  of  the  present  century.  Tlie  subject  of 
our  sketch  was  tiie  son  of  James  Hobbs  of  Staple  Hill,  manufacturer.  We  may 
mention  that  he  was  the  nephew  of  William  Hobbs  of  Didsbury,  Lancashire,  an 
extensive  cotton  manufacturer  of  Spring  Bank  Mills,  Stockport ;  Vale  House 
Mills,  Entwistle,  and  Gibraltar  Mills,  Ashton-under-Line,  England.  He  was  a 
Merchant  of  Montreal  from  1809  to  1817,  when  he  left  Canada. 

Mr.  Hobbs  came  to  Canada  at  the  age  of  twenty,  in  1851,  joining  the  firm  of 
W.  White,.;. d  &amp;  Co.,  successors  to  the  late  Peter  McGill  &amp;  Co.,  whose  business  he 
succeeded  in  1854,  which  he  carried  on  for  several  years.  In  1870,  as  promoter  of 
the  Hudon  Cotton  Mills,  he  organized  that  Company,  and  made  the  plans  for  the 
same.  In  1872,  he  organized  the  Montreal  Cotton  Company,  and  designed  iheplafts 
for  both  the  mills  and  bleach  works,  and  superintended  the  erection  of  the  mills 
and  machinery,  as  well  as  the  construction  of  the  canal  water  power,  etc., 
managing  the  mill  for  twelve  months,  until  it  was  in  good  working  order.  In  1879, 
he  organized  the  Coaticook  Cotton  Company,  and  constructed  the  mills  on  i)lans  of 
his  own  design,  and  ran  the  same  for  two  years,  realizing  large  profits  for  the  owners 
during  that  period.  In  1882,  he  organized  the  Magog  Textile  and  Print  Com|)any  of 
Magog,  at  the  outlet  of  Lake  Memphremagog,  d'jsigned  the  plans  for  the  building 
and  superintended  the  construction  of  the  same,  and  the  erection  of  the  machinery, 
with  the  assistance  of  his  son,  Mr.  William  Henry  Hobbs,  and  started  all  the  cotton

macliinery.  He  also  designed  the  dam,  embankment,  canal  and  tail  race,  creating 
a  power  of  2,500  horse  jjo'.ver.  In  1889,  he  assisted  Mr.  A.  K.  Gault  in  the  amal- 
gamation and  consolidation  of  the  Dominion  Cotton  Mills  Company,  embracing 
nearly  all  the  grey  and  white  cotton  mills  in  the  Dominion.  Mr.  Hobbs  is  still  active, 
and  lias  in  hand  jjrojecls  in  farther  developing  water  power  which  it  is  believed  will 
bring  him  slill  further  honors,  and  eclipse  all  he  has  done  in  the  past  towards  the 
development  of  his  adopted  coinury,  and  the  advancement  of  Montreal  in  particular. 

CIIAS.  E.  GOAD. 
**  DuuiNc;  the  last  seventeen  years  there  has  been  established  in  Canada  a  very 
important  system  of  Insurance  Surveys.  The  credit  for  the  establishment  of  this 
system  belongs  to  Mr.  Chas.  K.  Goad,  CI''..,  of  Montreal,  Toronto  and  London,  E.G., 
England.  Mr.  Goad,  who  is  a  member  of  the  American  Society,  and  of  the  Canadian 
Society  of  Civil  Engineers,  began  his  career  on  the  staff  of  the  Toronto,  Grey  and 
Bruce  Railway,  llu-n  of  the  Montreal  Northern  ('olonization  Railway,  and  in  1876 
was  Chief  luigineer  of  the  Halifax  and  Cape  Bret  )n,  after  which  he  found  it  neces- 
sary to  the  success  of  the  system  of  insurance  plans  which  he  had  inaugurated,  to 
give  his  whole  time  to  the  supervision  of  the  work.  A  few  years  ago  Mr.  Goad 
extended  his  operations  to  the  United  Kingdom,  where  the  work  is  very  much  more 
difficult,  owing  to  the  crooked  and  irregular  thoroughfares  and  the  manner  in  which 
the  buildings  have  been  crowded  together.  In  the  B.-itish  Isles,  the  surveys  include 
twe  ily-five  of  the  largest  cities  and  towns,  and  cover  an  area  of  nearly  twenty  square 
miles  of  the  most  closely  built  and  valuable  blocks  in  the  world.  His  Atlas  of 
Montreal  shows  all  building  and  street  numbers,  and  also  the  official  sub-division 
numbers,  which  render  it  of  great  service  to  all  who  are  interested  in  real  estate. 
Recently  he  has  issued  an  excellent  map  of  Montreal  and  vicinity,  which  is  acknow- 
ledged to  be  the  best  and  most  comprehensive  map  of  the  city  ever  published,  and 
Mr.  Goad  has  exhibited  considerable  public  spirit  in  producing  so  good  a  work  at  a 
popular  price."

GEORGE  A.  HOLLAND,  Sen. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  at  Mounl  Shannon,  Ireland,  on  the  12th  May, 
181 2.  His  parents  were  Andrew  Holland  and  Jane  Clarke.  He  was  educated  in 
Ireland.  He  came  to  Canada  and  settled  at  New  Glasgow  in  1827.  Tlien  canie  to 
Montreal  in  1832,  and  began  business  as  clerk  with  his  brother  John,  and  during  the 
Rebellion  took  up  arms  to  suppress  it.  He  was  then  of  the  "  Band"  in  tlie  army 
that  attacked  St.  Eustache.  After  some  time  he  opened  up  for  himself  in  Notre 
Dame  street,  where  he  continued  for  many  years  as  one  of  the  largest  businesses  in 
Montreal  of  wall  paper  and  general  fancy  goods.  At  one  time  he  did  the  entire 
wholesale  business  of  these  lines  of  goods.  He  continued  attending  to  the  routine 
of  the  establishment  till  his  death  on  ist  July,  1883.  Mr.  Holland  was  among  the 
first  who  sold  largely  to  the  Indians  and  the  Hudson  Bay  Company.  His  two 
brothers  are  still  in  Montreal  and  well-known  citizens,  Richard  and  Andrew. 

The  business  is  now  carried  on  by  his  youngest  son  in  Notre  Dame  street. 
George,  his  eldest  son,  is  engaged  in  the  importation  and  manufacture  of  musical 
instruments.  He  has  the  largest  stock  of  band  instruments  in  the  Dominion,  and 
is  a  thorough  musician.  Hardly  any  public  entertainment  is  given,  or  concert 
arranged,  without  his  aid  and  advice,  himself  being  one  of  the  principal  ])erformers. 

George  was  born  in  Montreal,  nth  December,  1843.  He  commenced  to 
study  music  (violin  first)  at  seven  years  of  age.  He  joined  the  Active  Militia 
at  the  time  of  Trent  Troubles  as  Bandsman  of  the  Victoria  Rifles,  where  he 
remained  for  twelve  years.  He  then  joined  the  Sixth  Fusiliers,  where  he 
also  remained  for  twelve  years.  He  is  now  attached  to  the  Royal  Scots.  He  rose 
from  private  to  Bandmaster,  He  plays  every  instrument  of  both  brass  and  string. 
He  is  proficient  also  on  the  clarionet.  He  has  performed  in  nearly  all  the  principal 
cities  of  the  Dominion  and  throughout  part  of  the  United  Slates.  He  has  also 
played  at  nearly  all  the  principal  local  concerts  of  Montreal  where  instrumental  music 
was  required,  and  at  all  the  military  concerts  which  were  got  up  in  the  old  Crystal 
Palace  by  Colonel  P'ane,  of  the  25th  Regiment. 

He  is,  therefore,  an  authority  as  to  value  and  make  of  almost  any  instrument, 
having  made  it  a  life  study.  All  kinds  of  instruments  are  sent  from  over  the  whole 
Continent  for  his  examination  and  approval.  He  is  a  true  Monlrealer,  and  one  that 
the  City  may  be  proud  of  as  regards  his  instrumental  lore  and  great  musical  ability.

PIERRK   S.  GKNDRON. 

He  was  one  of  the  late  Pjothnnotaries  of  Montreal.  He  was  born  at  St.  Rosalie, 
on  the  31st  of  Auyust,  18^,  and  educated  in  the  College  of  St.  Hyacinthe  ;  he  then 
taught  for  nine  years  in  the  country,  during  which  he  sliidicd  Law  under  Mr.  Louis 
Tache.  In  I060,  he  was  admitted  to  the  Har.  Ho  jiracliced  as  a  notary  from  i860 
to  1876.  and  was  then  called  to  the  office  of  Prothonolary  of  Montreal.  He 
was  elected  Member  for  Bagot  in  the  House  of  Commons  in  1867.  Li  1871,  he  was 
again  elected.  Li  1872,  re-elected.  Li  1873,  dual  representation  was  abolished,  and 
he  preferred  to  retain  his  seat  in  the  Local  and  not  tiie  Federal  Legislature.  He 
married  in  May,  1850,  Louise  Fournier.  One  of  his  sons  was  once  President  and 
Professor  of  Philosophy  in  St.  Hyacinthe  Colk-ge. 

HON.  WILLIAM  MORRIS 

Was  born  at  Paisley,  on  the  31st  October,  1786.  On  arriving  at  Montreal,  Mr. 
Morris'  father  determined  to  remain  in  the  city.  He  then  engaged  in  shipping. 
Mr.  Morris  was  occupied  in  the  quiet  pursuit  of  his  calling  when  a  shij)  owned  by 
him,  richly  laden,  was  lost  in  the  Straits  of  Belle  Isle.  The  consequence  was  that 
h'  was  ruined  and  left  Montreal  to  settle  on  a  firm  near  Brockville.  Li  1809,  he 
died.  The  Hon.  William  Morris  and  Mr.  Alexander  Morris,  eleven  years  afterwards, 
voluntarily  paid  all  his  debts.,  and  received  from  the  creditors  as  a  mark  of  regard 
two  handsome  pieces  of  plate.  In  1S12,  when  war  with  the  United  States  was 
declared,  Mr.  Morris  left  his  business  to  serve  his  country.  Having  received  his 
commission  of  Ensign  from  General  Brock,  he  joined  the  militia  flank  companies. 
In  October  he  volunteered  with  a  British  force  under  Lieut. -Col.  Lcthbridge  in  the 
attack  on  Ogdensburg.  After  the  close  of  the  war,  1816,  he  proceeded  with  the 
military  settlers  to  the  lands  allotted  to  them,  near  the  Rideau,  and  began  business 
in  Perth. 

About  1820,  he  was  elected  to  the  Provincial  Parliament.  Not  long  after  he 
initiated  the  discussion  of  that  great  Clergy  Reserve  question,  which,  for  good  or 
evil,  is  inseparably  associated  with  his  name.  In  the  year  1820,  he  moved  and  carried 
an  address  to  the  King,  asserting  the  claim  of  the  Church  of  Scotland  to  a  share  of 
the  Clergy  Reserves.  In  1835,  '^'^  ^^'^^  elected  for  the  sixth  time  for  Lanark.  In 
1836,  he  was  called  to  the  Legislative  Council.  In  1837,  there  was  a  gathering  in 
Cobourg  of  members  of  the  Scotch  Church  from  all  parts  of  Canada.  The  object 
was  to  take  counsel,  to  address  the  Throne,  and  claim  with  their  fellow-subjects  of 
English  origin  a  fair  share  of  the  lands  set  apart  for  the  maintenance  of  a  Protestant 
clergy.  Mr.  Morris  and  Dr.  Mathieson  of  Montreal  were  appointed  to  be  the  bearers 
of  petitions  to  the  Queen  and  Parliament,  setting  forth  the  grievances  of  the  Scottish 
race  in  Canada.  Mr.  Morris'  conduct  was  so  satisfactory  that  his  countrymen  pre- 
sented him  with  a  handsome  piece  of  plate. 

In  1837-8  he  exerted  great  influence  in  organizing  the  militia  of  his  county.  In 
1841,  he  was  appointed  Warden  of  the  District  of  Johnstown.     At  the  union  of  the 


OAZKTTKKR    OK    MONTREAL.  49^ 

Provinces,  he  was  called  to  the  Legislative  Council  of  Canada  ;  Septembi-T,  1844,  he 
was  invited  to  accept  the  office  of  Receiver-General,  and  a  seat  in  the  Kxecutive 
Council.  This  office  he  continued  to  fill  till  May,  1847,  when  he  succeeded  to  the 
Presidency,  which  he  held  until  the  resignation  of  the  (lovernment  in  March,  1S4.S. 
From  October,  1844,  to  June,  1846,  he  was  also  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Works. 
He  died  on  the  29th  June,  1858,  in  the  72nd  yea'-  of  his  age.

In  1.S2S,  the  subject  of  this  sketch,  tlie  widow  of  J.  \l  GameUii,  commenced  a  com- 
pany to  look  after  the  aged  and  infirm  women  of  the  city,  and  to  visit  tlie  sick  at  tiieir 
homes,  but  esi)ecially  the  poor,  which  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  the  Sisters  of 
"  ImI  I'rovidence."  His  (Irace  the  late  Arciibishop  lJ(Kirget  sanctioned  the  work  and 
blessed  the  community  in  i(S44 — six  Sisters,  she  was  the  fust  Superioress.  At  first  there 
were  only  six  Sisters,  now  lliey  arc  an  influential  body,  and  have  built  some  very  fine 
eslablislimeiUs  in  and  around  iMontreal.  Ciiicf  of  these  were  the  inuneiise 
buildings  at  Longue  Pointe  (burned  some  time  ago),  wiiere  one  of  the  largest 
Lunatic  establishments  in  the  world  was  located.  Of  all  the  Sisters  which  have 
joined  this  Community  none  have  been  so  much  before  the  public  as  Sister 
Ther^se,  who  died  a  short  time  ago.  She  never  recovered  the  effects  of  the  terrible 
catastrophe  of  the  burning  of  her  grand  home  for  lunatics. 

MLLE.  MARIE  ESTHER  S.  15LONDIN. 

This  lady  was  the  first  Superioress  of  the  "  Filles  de  Sle.  Anne."  On  the  13th  Sep- 
tember, 1848,  the  Bishop  of  Montrenl  authorized  several  pious  persons  to  uniti,'  at 
Vaudreuil  and  live  in  a  Community.  They  procured  the  buildings  of  the  Sacred 
Heart,  and  established  themselves  at  Lachine,  where  they  have  a  fine  Boarding 
Sciiool  and  Institution  for  the  education  of  young  girls.  The  Convent  is  beautifully 
situated  on  the  banks  of  the  St.  Lawrenco,  opposite  the  Lachine  Rapids,  and  every 
attention  is  paid  to  the  education  and  oversight  of  the  large  number  of  pupils  always 
intrusted  to  their  care. 

II.  M.  GILES 

Was  born  in  London,  of  an  old  Kentish  family,  in  1834  ;  educated  at  the  Grammar 
School,  Bedford;  canu  to  Canada  in  1S45,  to  St.  Catharines,  Ontario.  He  came  to 
Montreal  in  1881.  He  has  written  largely  for  the  press.  Many  of  his  poems  are 
well  known  to  the  reading  public.  Some  of  them  attracted  the  notice  of  Longfellow 
and  Charles  McKay,  from  whom  Mr.  Giles  received  flattering  letters  in  connection 
with  them.  He  is  also  the  author  of  a  most  interesting  work,  styled  "Vox  Dei 
aut  Vox  Populi,"  published  in  1874.  This  work  received  the  highest  commenda- 
tion of  the  Rev.  T.  C.  Evans,  D.D.,  of  New  York,  who,  reviewing  it,  thus  says  : — 
"  It  is  as  a  whole  so  admirable  in  respect  of  perspicuity,  strength,  vivacity,  terseness 
of  expression,  in  short  of  all  those  elements  which  are  clustered  under  the  phrase, 
*  English  style.'  It  is  so  copious  in  apt  quotations  and  so  convincing  in  all  its 
arguments."  For  some  years  Mr.  Giles  has  not  written  much,  his  time  being  too 
occupied  ;  but  perhaps  in  the  near  future  all  his  fugitive  pieces  may  be  gathered 
together,  and  they  will  surely  make  one  of  the  most  readable  volumes  published  in 
this  country.

FRANCIS  CASSIDY,  Q.C. 

Thk  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  of  Irisli  p;irciita|^'c  at  the  \'ilhige  of  St.  Jacques

Receiver-Cicneral,  at  an  income  of  £400  per  annum,  which  Mr.  Cassidy  nuxlestly  refused 
on  account  of  his  youth.  At  the  time  of  his  death  he  was  one  of  the  oldest  practition-

of  (Quebec.  On  the  retirement  of  Mr.  Coursol  from  the  Mayoralty  in  i'ebruary, 
1872,  Mr.  Cassidy  was  elected  by  acclamation.  Illness,  however,  ])reveiited  him 
from  occui)ying  the  office  long.  He,  however,  fullilled  the  duties  of  Mayor  in  an 
able  manner  during  the  short  term  which  his  health  permitted  him  to  do.  Not  long 
before  his  election  to  the  Chief  Magistracy  of  the  city,  Mr.  Cassidy  was  seized  with 
a  severe  illness,  being  very  feeble  at  the  time  of  his  inauguration,  and  afterwards  pie- 
vented,  except  on  one  or  two  occasions,  from  filling  the  office.  He  died  on  the  r4lh 
June,  1 87 2.  His  only  brother,  John  L.  Cassidy,  lately  deceased,  was  one  of  the 
largest — if  not  the  largest — merchants  in  glassware  and  china  in  Montreal,  his  busi- 
ness being  carried  on  in  that  beautiful  block  on  St.  Paul  street  called  the  Nuns 
Buildings. 

ALEX.  H.  KOLLMYER,  M.D., 

Is  the  son  of  the  late  Henry  Christian  Kollmyer,  and  was  born  in  Montreal,  May  18, 
1832.  He  was  educated  here,  especially  in  the  Royal  Grammar  School  kept  by  the 
late  Alexander  Skakel,  TJ^.D.  This  was  then  the  only  institution  in  Montreal  where 
a  classical  education  could  be  obtained.  When  that  gentleman  died,  all  the  pu])ils 
were  transferred  to  the  High  School,  which  was  then  under  the  care  of  the  Rev.  Mr. 
Simpson.  He  remained  there  until  1848,  when  he  became  connected  with  the  then 
well-known  establishment  of  R.  W.  Rexford,  Chemist  and  Druggist,  remaining  there 
for  four  years. 

Desirous  to  prosecute  Medicnie,  he  became,  in  i85i,a  student  of  McGill,  and 
was  appointed  House  Apothecary  to  the  Montreal  General  Hospital  in  1855.  In 
1856,  he  obtained  his  degree  of  i\LD.  In  1868,  he  was  appointed  Lecturer  on 
Materia  Medica  in  the  Montreal  College  of  Pharmacy.  In  1869,  he  was  appointed 
Lecturer  on  Botany  in  the  same  Institution,  and  in  1872-73,  he  alone  gave,  greatly  to 
his  credit,  the  whole  of  the  three  courses  of  six  months  lectures  on  Chemistry, 
Materia  Medica  and  on  Botany,  and  solely  through  his  instrumentality  is  due  the 
fact  that  by  his  keeping  up  these  lectures  the  druggists  of  Montreal  obtained  their  bill 
through  Parliament  in  1874,  by  which  they  are  now  enabled  to  educate   and  license

Therapeutics  in  the  Medical  Faculty  of  the  University  of  Bishop's  College,  and  during 
the  same  year  an  honorary  degree  of  M.A.  was  conferred  upon  him  by  the  same 
University  at  its  Convention  in  Lennoxville.     He  died  some  years  ago. 

WILFRED  PREVOST. 

He  was  descended  from  Guillaume  Prevost,  a  merchant  of  Paris,  France,  who  was 
one  of  the  Cent  Associes,  son  of  M.  Guillaume  Prevost,  merchant  of  St.  Anne  des 
Plaines,  Terrebonne,  Quebec,  by  Marie  losephle  Quevillon  ;  and  brother  of  G.  M. 
Prevost,  N.P.,  who  represented  the  County  in  the  Canadian  Assembly  from  1854 
to  1857.  He  was  born  at  St.  Anne  des  Plaines,  ist  of  May,  1832,  and  educated  at 
St.  Sulpice  College,  Montreal,  and  at  the  Colleges  of  L'Assomption  and  St.  Hyacinthe. 
He  married  4th  July,  1852,  Dclle  Angelicpie  Reine  Marier,  He  was  called  to 
the  ]^ar  of  Lower  Canada  in  1853,  and  enjoys  an  extensive  practice  in  the  District 
of  Terrebonne.  After  repeated  refusals  to  accept  representation  of  the  County  in 
Parliament,  at  length  he  con.sented  to  stand  for  the  Commons  at  the  General  Elec- 
tions of  1872,  and  was  returned  by  acclamation;  re-elected  at  last  General   Election. 

WM.  H.  DRUMMOND,  M.D. 

Thk  subject  of  our  sketch  is  an  Irishman,  having  been  born  in  the  County  of  Lei- 
trim,  Ireland.  He  came  to  Canada  when  only  eleven  years  of  age  with  his  family. 
His  father  was  an  officer  in  the  Royal  Irish  Constabulary. 

On  arriving  in  this  country  the  family  settled  in  Montreal,  where  the  father  died 
within  a  year  afterwards.  Dr.  Drummond  was  educated  in  Montreal,  and  graduated 
from  Bishop's  University  as  CM.,  M.D.,  in  18S3.  He  at  once  engaged  in  the 
practice  of  his  profession,  and  shortly  afier  located  at  Slornoway,  in  the  eastern  part 
of  St.  Francis  District,  and  afterwards  for  a  time  at  Knowlton,  Quebec. 

In  1887,  he  returned  to  Montreal.  In  his  younger  days  he  gave  a  good  account 
of  his  skill  and  ability  in  the  gymnasium  and  athletic  field.  He  is  a  thorough  sports- 
man, fully  imbued  with  the  true  spirit  of  sport.  He  is  a  capital  shot.  Last  year, 
on  the  Grand  Cascapedia,  he  had  the  good  fortune  to  kill  the  monarch  of  the  salmon 
season  of  1890,  weighing  50  lbs.  8  oz. 

He  has  three  brothers,  two  of  whom,  George  E.  and  Thomas  J.  Drummond,  are 
the  well-known  iron  and  steel  merchants,  of  Montreal.  The  other,  John  J.  Drum- 
mond, is  Manager  of  the  Canada  Iron  Foundry  Company  at  Radnor,  Quebec.  The 
wonderful  development  of  the  country  in  its  iron  industry  is  spoken  of  in  this 
Gazetter  at  page  308,  and  commends  itself  to  all  our  readers. 

Mr.  Drummond's  reputation  as  a  humorous  writer^  especially  of  habitant  Eng- 
lish verse,  extends  all  over  the  Continent.  That  his  poetic  genius  is  not  confined 
to  the  humorous  or  burlesque,  is  evidenced  by  his  "  October  Days."  One  of  his 
articles,  Cauda  Morrhtue,  shows  a  good  deal  of  the  Tom  Hood  versatility  of 
composition.

"  Prince  of  Wales  Royal  (Canadian  Regiment,'  then  being  organized,   a  position  he 
accepted,  but  subsequenily,  for  private  reasons,   he    resigned,    notwithstanding  that 
he  had  passed  the  necessary  examinations  therefor.     On  two  occasions   he  declined 
important  ap[)ointments  under  Government,  and  after  the  death  of  Sir  G.  E.  Cariier, 
refused  a  seat  in  the  Cabinet  owing  to  the  unsettled  policy  of  the  Government  on 
the  Manitoba  Amnesty  and  the  N.  B.  School  questions,  but   principally  on  account 
of  the  Pacific  Railway  charges   then  pending.     He  sat   for  Laval  in  the  Canadian 
Assembly  from  the  General  Election  in  1863   until  the  Union,  and  for  the  same  seat

was  for  some  years  Chairman  of  the  Private  Bills  Committee  of  the  Senate.     Luring 
the  Session  of  1871  he  was  offered  the  Speakership  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  of 
Quebec  for  the   next  Parliament,   which   he   then   accepted.      He   is  still,  as   ever, 
always  on  the  lookout  for  everything  that  may  benefit  Canada  in    general,  and  his 
native   Province — Quebec — in    particular.     He  resides   at  St.  Vincent   de    Paul,   a 
beautiful  village  on  the  banks  of  the   "  Back  River,"  as   it  is  called,  and  is  only  a 
few  miles  from  Montreal.

REV.  CHAS.  BANCROFT,  D.D.,  LL.U. 

The  subject  of  our  sketch  is  one  of  the  very  few  in  this  great  list  of  seven  hundred 
Biographies  pubHshed  in  this  Gazettekr  that  was  born  in  Montreal,  therefore 
claiming  the  Mctropolitical  city  of  the  Dominion  as  his  birthplace,  and  like  the 
others  being  an  ornament  to  Montreal.  He  was  born  in  Montreal,  July  iQih,  1819  , 
educated  at  Rev.  Dr.  Muhlenberg's  School,  New  York,  and  afterwards  entered  as  a 
student  in  Columbia  College  (wiiich  formerly  was  called  King's),  New  York  City. 
There  he  passed  through  all  his  classes  with  distinction,  and  after  his  curriculum  grad- 
uated first  as  15. A.,  tiien  M.A.,  and  latterly  D.I).  He  was  one  of  our  Montreal  clergy 
rt'hu  received  more  honors  than  generally  falls  to  the  lot  of  citizens  of  this  city.  He 
received  an  ad  eundem  M.A.,  and  afterwards  D.D.  from  Bishop's  College,  Lcnnox- 
ville,  and  an  M.A.  and  LL.D.  from  McGill  University,  Montreal — honors  well 
bestowed  on  a  son  of  the  soil. 

Dr.  Bancroft  was  ordained  Deacon  in  18/3  and  Priest  in  1844  by  the  Bishop  of 
Quebec.  He  was  tirst  appointed  to  St.  Paul's  Chapel,  Quebec  ;  afterwards  lie  was 
Curate. at  St.  Anne's,  Brooklyn,  N.Y.  Resigning  this  cure  he  was  appointed  to  St. 
Thomas's  Church,  Montreal,  before  that  edifice  was  donated  to  the  diocese  by  the 
will  of  the  late  'I'homas  Molson,  and  the  choice  had  fallen  on  him.  It  is  rather 
remarkable  that  the  choice  has  ever  since  been  given  to  St.  Johns  or  neighboring 
clergy.  Tiiey  have  been  since  Dr.  Bancroft's  day  :  Rev.  Mr.  McLeod,  late  of  Christie- 
ville  ;  Rev.  Robert  Lindsay,  late  of  Brome,  and  now  Rev.  Mr.  Renaud,  late  Rector 
of  St.  Johns,  Quebec. 

In  1848,  he  left  St.  Thomas  and  became  Rector  of  St.  Johns,  where  he  remamed 
till  September,  1858.  In  October  of  the  samt;  year  he  was  appointed  Rector  of 
Trinity  Church,  Montreal,  where  he  continued  till  his  death.  His  great  work  was  in 
erecting  that  beautiful  structure,  the  present  Trinity  Church  in  Viger  Square,  the 
graceful  spire  of  which  was  raised  at  the  sole  expense  of  the  late  William  Molson, 
Ks(i.  For  years  the  large  congregation  worshipped  in  what  was  once  a  Dissenting 
Chapel,  then  the  Cathedral  ("lunch,  after  the  Parish  Church  was  burned  in  Notre 
Dame  street,  and  it  is  now  a  manufactory,  opposite  the  north  entrance  to  the  Champ 
de  Mars.  When  Trinity  finally  abandoned  this  building  it  was  used  as  a  Military 
Chapel,  and  the  writer  and  Author  of  this  volume  was  one  of  Her  Gracious  Majesty's 
Military  Chaplains,  who  conducted  services  in  it.  Before  that  and  for  some  time  he 
had  been  Assistant  Minister  to  Dr.  Bancroft  in  Trinity  Church  (the  same  building). 
This  was  his  first  clerical  charge. 

In  1854,  Dr.  Bancroft  was  made  an  Honorary  Canon  of  Christ  Church  Cathedral. 
He  published  a  volume  called  "  The  Church  Hymn  Book, '  which  was  greatly 
used  throughout  the  Diocese  in  these  days.  He  also  issued  "  Family  Prayers," 
a  "  Sunday  School  Manual  "  and  a  volume  of  Sermons.  Aficr  a  busy,  earnest  and 
successful  life  he  died  near  Boston,  Mass.,  November  26th,  1877.  He  married  in 
Philadelphia,  in  1844,  Miss  Smith,  and  had  two  sons  and  five  surviving  daughters.

His  son  following  in  the  footsteps  of  his  father,  entered  the  ministry  of  the  Church, 
Charles,  after  his  father's  name,  was  also  born  in  Montreal  in  1845.  He  was  edu- 
cated at  iMcGill  College  and  at  Caius  College,  Cambridge,  England.  He  is  a 
graduate  of  McGili  College.  Ordained  Deacon  in  1866  and  Priest  in  1869,  he  was 
first  Curate  of  Trinity  Churcli,  Montreal,  then  Curate  of  Woodstock,  Ont.  After  this 
he  was  Incumbent  of  Mansonvillc,  Quebec,  and  Rector  of  Knowlton.  At  present 
he  is  Rector  of  Sutton.  He  married,  in  1869,  Miss  Foster,  of  Knowlton,  and  has 
seven  children,  I  have,  as  Author  of  this  Gazkttkkr,  much  pleasure  in  recording  the 
past  career  of  my  pupil,  Rev.  Charles  Bancroft,  jun.,  and  remark  that  he  was  the 
Preacher  at  the  last  meeting  of  the  Synod  of  the  Diocese  of  Montreal. 

One  of  the  daughters  of  the  late  Dr.  Bancroft  married  Mr.  R.  H,  Buchanan,  an 
important  agent  in  Montreal  for  all  kinds  of  machinery,  but  he  is  best  known  as  the 
enlightened  and  well-beloved  Superintendent  of  Christ  Church  Cathedral  Sunday 
School,  which  position  he  has  held  for  many  years.  He  is  a  cousin  of  W.  Buchanan, 
Esq.,  late  President  of  the  ]]ank  of  Montreal,  and  as  a  young  man,  he  is  one  to  be 
held  up  as  a  beacon  light  toother  Montrealers  to  go  and  do  likewise.  His  whole  soul 
is  in  his  Sunday  School  work  ;  and  here  publicly  I  thank  him,  and  my  confri'r':  the 
Roman  Catholic  Chaplain  does  also,  that  he  donated  by  his  Sunday  School  children 
to  the  Montreal  Male  Prison  a  Melodeon,  by  which  the  Sunday  services  are  much 
more  improved,  and  both  the  Gregorian  and  modern  chants  are  much  appreciated  by 
the  "miserable  sinners"  within  its  walls.

has  remained  during  all  the  "  chances  and  changes  "  of  spiritual  rulers  and  city  de- 
velopment.   The  oi'ginal  building  has  passed  away,  being  an  old  school  house  in  what 
was  once  called  the  English  Burying  Ground,  now  Dufferm  square.     Afterwards  a 
small  chapel  was  built  at  the  corner  of  St.  Urbain  and  Dorchester  streets  where  the 
congregation  met  for  many  years  until  it  was  impossible  to  give  room  to  the  numbers 
who  always  crowded  to  llie  services.     At  last  the  congregation  determined  to  build 
a  much  larger  church,  which  was  accomplished  in  tiie  edifice  that  now  stands  at  the 
corner  of  Ontario  and  St.  Urbain  streets.     One  of  the  largest  and  most  flourishing 
congregations  in  Montreal  constantly  attend  this  church.     It  is  the  only  (what  may 
be  called)  High  Church  in  the  city  in  connection  with  the  Church  of  P^ngland — the 
Rector  being  al^ly  assisted  by  Rev.  Dr.  Wright  and  Rev.  Arthur  French,  B.A.  Oxon. 
For  years  the  only  really  Church  School  in  Montreal,  perhaps  in  the  Province, 
except  that  of  Lennoxville,  in  connection  with  the  college,  has  been  kept  up  by  the 
hard-working   clergy   of  St.  John's.     And    after  years   of  patient  toil,  they  have  at 
last   seen  one  of   the   best  buildings   for  a  new  School,  Rectory,  Boys'   Boarding 
Establishment,  etc.,  built  on  the  vacant  lot  of  the  Church  property.     This  school  is 
undoubtedly  one  of  the  best  in  the  country.     It  has  all  the  appliances  of  the  best 
institutions  of  the  present  day  with  a  large  staff  of  skilled  and  talented  masters,  and 
is  always  full  to  the  required  number.     Rev.  A.  French  is  the  head  master,  a  born 
teacher,  and  a  credit  to  St.  John's.     One  of  the  lately  deceased  citizens  of  Montreal 
enabled  the  Corporation  of  the  Church  and  School   to  complete  the  whole  arrange- 
ment by  a  generous  gift  of  ten  thousand  dollars ;  another  friend  has  lately  given 
$5,000  for  a  new  organ  to  the  church  ;  another  at  his  death  a  few  weeks  ago  has  lefc 
$10,000  to  the  Rector;  certain  friends  are  about  erecting  a  pulpit  which  will  cost 
at  least  five   thousand  dollars, — so  the  good  work  goes  on.     Although  Mr.  Wood 
has    now     been   over    thirty  years    as    Incumbent   and    Rector   of  St.    John's,   he 
still  glories  in   the  plain  ecclesiastical  title  of  "Mr.,"  and  while  he  has  seen  men 
advanced  high  in  station  in  the  Church,  he  has  labored  on — not  for  the  empty  titles 
of  this  world,  which   soon   pass  away,  but  for  that  crown   which  never  fiides   in 
Paradise.     Long  may  he  yet  be  si)ared  to  continue  his  good  work.     The  Author  of 
this  short  sketch  can  testify  in  his  i)eregrinations  amongst  all  nationalities  and  classes 
in  his  position  as  Chaplain  to  the  Gaols  of  Montreal,  and  thus  meeting  all   *'  kinds  and 
conditions  of  men,"   that  he  has  never  heard  one  derogatory  word  spoken  against 
'*  Father  Wood,"  as  he  is  so  popularly  called  by  every  denomination,  bi.U  ever  and

always  has  heard  him  spoken  of  in  thehigliest  terms  of  praise,  admiration  and  friend- 
ship. His  life  is  wrapped  up  in  St,  John's ;  for  its  advancement  he  has  in  the  i)ast 
labored,  for  its  advancement  in  tiie  future  is  he  only  anxious;  and  when  all  is 
accomplished,  when  the  church  outwardly  and  internally  is  finished,  when  the 
various  Guilds,  Associations  and  Societies  are  fully  equipped,  and  all  the  externals  of 
the  Parish,  as  well  as  the  internal  arrangements  of  the  Church  and  School,  are  fully 
completed,  then  he  will  be  able  to  say  as  St.  Simeon  in  his  Divine  Canticle,  and  which 
he  has  so  often  sung  for  over  thirty  years  at  P^vensong  in  his  loved  church,  in  his 
own  harmonious  and  rich  voice,  "  Lord  now  lettest  thou  Thy  servant  depart  in  peace."

REV.  DONALD  FRASER,  D.D. 


'' London,  February  13th,  1892. — Rev.  Donald  Fraser,  M.A.,  D.D.,  died  to-day." 
Such  was  the  announcement,  a  few  days  ago,  of  the  death  of  a  former  well-known 
minister  of  Montreal. 

"  Donald  PVaser,  M.A.,  D.D.,  was  well-known  to  Montrcalers,  having  served  for 
some  years  as  minister  of  the  old  Cotte  Street  Presbyterian  Church.  He  was  born 
at  Inverness,  Scotland,  on  January   15th,    1826,   his  father  being  Provost  of  the

Borough  and  his  motht-r  one  of  the  Frasers  of  Kirkhill.  After  five  years'  study  at 
Aberdeen  University  he  took  tlie  degree  of  M.A.  He  studied  Divinity  at  Knox  Col- 
lege, Toronto,  and  later  at  tlie  New  College,  Edinburgh.  He  was  ordained  a  Minister 
in  1851,  and  inducted  to  the  charge  of  Cotte  street  congregation.  In  1859,  he  took 
charge  of  the  Free  Church  congregation  in  his  native  town  of  Inverness.  In  1870, 
he  accepted  a  call  to  the  Marylebone  Presbyterian  Church,  London,  where  he  has 
since  labored,  becoming  one  of  the  best  known  of  the  ministers  of  the  great 
metropolis.  Twice  he  was  elected  Moderator  of  the  Presbyterian  Church  of  England. 
He  was  also  Vice-President  of  the  British  and  Foreign  Bible  Society,  and  was 
prominently  connected  with  many  missions  and  charities.  In  1872,  the  University 
of  Aberdeen  conferred  on  him  the  degree  of  D.D.  He  published  at  various  times 
two  volumes  of  "  Synoptical  Lectures  on  the  Books  of  Holy  Scripture,"  which  went 
througii  four  editions  ;  *'  Metaphors  in  the  Ciospels  ;  "  "  Seven  Promises  Expounded  ;  " 
"  Speeches  of  the  Holy  Apostles,"  two  editions ;  "  The  Church  of  God  and  the 
Apostacy,"  and  a  "  Biography  of  Thomas  Chalmers,  D.D.,"  and  of  "  Mary  Jane, 
Lady  Kinnaird."  He  contributed  also  to  the  Pulpit  Commentary  and  various  reviews. 
Colonel  Torrance  Fraser,  his  brother,  is  the  only  one  of  the  family  now  remaining." 

ALEXANDER  FERGUSON. 

He  was  the  son  of  an  old  Waterloo  hero,  wiio  was  a  comrade  in  arms  of  the  well- 
known  Colin  McDonald,  late  Town  Major.  They  were  both  in  the  79th  Highlanders. 
The  subject  of  this  sketch  was  born  in  Edinburgh  Castle  in  1810,  where  his  father's 
regiment  was  stationed.  It  is  said  he  was  born  in  the  very  identical  room  where  Mary, 
Queen  of  Scots,  was  born.  This  is  doubtful,  as  that  part  of  the  Castle  is  set  apart  as 
precious  to  Scotsmen  in  general  and  antiquarians  in  jiarticular.  Alexander  Ferguson 
came  to  Montreal  in  1840.  He  entered  into  the  forwarding  business  under  the  firm  of 
Macpherson  &amp;  Crane,  ultimately  becoming'a  partner.  Although  immersed  in  trade, 
he  had  a  fine  literary  taste,  and  many  articles  of  his  appeared  in  the  Herald  under 
the  nom  de  plume  of  '•  McCrimmon."  He  died  of  consumption,  istMay,  1846.  He 
was  married  to  a  Miss  Orkney,  grand-daughter  of  the  first  Benaiah  Gibb.  Mrs. 
Ferguson,  his  widow,  lived  with  Benaiah  Gibb,  Jun.,  in  his  fine  house,  near  Phillips 
Square,  and  she  died  not  many  years  ago. 

JOHN  BATES,  Sen., 

Was  born  in  1800,  in  Wexford  County,  Ireland.  He  married  Elizabeth,  daughter  of 
Lieut.  John  Sutton  of  the  Cavalry,  Wicklow,  a  family  name  well  known  in  that  part  of 
Ireland.  Mr.  Bates  came  to  Montreal  in  1832,  and  for  years  was  connected  with  the 
Sheriff's  Office.  He  died  in  1876.  He  was  one  of  the  first  Church  Wardens  of  St. 
John  the  Evangelist's.  Two  of  his  sons  are  advocates  in  Montreal :  John  was  admitted 
to  the  Bar  in  1849,  ^"d  William  in  the  same  year.  They  are  now  among  the  oldest 
practising  Attorneys  in  the  city,  and  the  firm  of  J.  &amp;  W.  A.  Bates  was  in  existence 
before  the  present  generation  of  our  Montreal  citizens  was  born.  They  have  always 
been  respected  as  painstaking  and  conscientious  lawyers.

HON.  ALEXANDER  MORRIS

March,  1827.  Educated  in  McGill,  and  Glasgow,  Scotland.  Called  to  the  Bar  in 
1851  for  both  the  Canadas.  In  1861,  he  was  returned  for  South  J.anark.  In  1867, 
again  returned  by  acclamation,  and  in  November,  1869,  accepted  office  as  Minister 
of  Inland  Revenue.  Mr.  Morris  was  a  most  active  member  in  the  House.  For 
several  years  he  occupied  the  position  of  Chairman  of  the  Private  Bills  Committee. 
To  him  is  due  the  introduction  into  Parliament  of  a  most  humane  and  Christian  bill, 
"  The  abolition  of  Public  Executions."  One  of  the  great  aims  of  Mr.  Morris'  politi- 
cal career  was  the  Confederation  of  all  the  British  Provinces  into  one  grand  Do- 
minion. In  1858,  he  delivered  a  lecture  in  the  Mercantile  Library,  Montreal,  called 
"  Nova  Britannia  ; "  there  he  advocated  his  favorite  theory.  Next  year  he  published 
another  lecture  on  the  Hudson  Bay,  etc.,  in  which  similar  views  were  expressed.  His 
crowning  laurels  were  the  gaining  of  the  2nd  piizeof  the  Paris  Exhibition  Committee 
in  1855,  for  a  well-written  and  digested  work  on  Canada.  During  the  political  excite- 
ment of  1864,  Mr.  Morris  played  a  most  important  part,  and  through  him  alone  was 
brought  about  the  peaceful  negotiation  of  Sir  John  A.  Macdonald  with  Hon.  George 
Brown,  which  resulted  in  the  Confederation  of  the  Provinces.  He  died  some  years 
ago.

to  Montreal,  he  for  many  years  was  engaged  in  the  dry  goods  business,  first  as  Scott, 
Tyre  &amp;  Co.,  and  afterwards  Tyre,  Colquhoun  (S;  Co.  Retiring  from  business  he 
afterwards  became  an  official  assignee.  He  was  a  keen  curler,  and  was  one  of  the 
four  "  Auld  Gallants,"  a  rare  old  quartette,  consisting  of  Col.  Dyde,  Sir  Hugh 
Allan,  Hon.  John  Young  and  James  Tyre.  After  an  eventful  life  he  died  at  Lachine, 
May  8,  1876.

son  is  the  Rector  of  Drummondville,  in  the  Diocese  of  Quebec.  Another  son  is  in 
Montreal.  He  died  some  years  ago  universally  lamented  as  a  skilful  physician,  a 
gentleman  of  unapproachable  character  and  a  valuable  citizen.

FRANK  HULLER,  M.D. 

The  subject  of  this  sketch  is  the  Lecturer  on  Diseases  of  the  Eye  and  Ear  in  McGill 
University.  He  is  one  of  the  most  skilful  scientists  of  his  profession  in  the  Dominion 
of  Canada,  and  deserves  a  place  in  this  Gazetteer  of  Montreal.  He  is  an  honor 
to  Canada  at  large,  being  a  pure  Canadian,  having  been  born  near  Cobourg,  Province 
of  Ontario,  on  the  4th  May,  1844.  He  was  the  fourth  son  of  Charles  G.  and  Frances 
Elizabeth  Boucher  BuUer.  His  father  was  educated  for  the  Church  of  England, 
but  declining  Holy  Orders,  emigrated  to  Canada  in  183 1,  and  settled  near  Cobourg. 
The  BuUer  family  had  for  centuries  occupied  an  important  position  in  the  south  of 
England,  and  his  brother  is  one  of  the  most  prominent  men  in  the  army  of  Great 
Britain  at  the  present  time — General  Buller.  Dr.  BuUer  graduated  at  Victoria  School 
of  Medicine,  Toronto,  in  1869;  then  went  to  London  and  other  cities  to  perfect  him- 
self in  his  profession.  He  again  went  to  Europe  in  1872.  On  his  return  he  began 
practice  in  Montreal,  1876.  In  May,  1876,  he  was  appointed  Ophdialmic  and  Aural 
Surgeon  to  the  General  Hospital  of  Montreal,  and  Lecturer  in  McGill.  Dr.  Buller 
is  a  self-made  man,  and  to  the  younger  members  of  the  profession  an  example  of 
what  pluck,  energy  and  perseverance  will  do  when  the  object  is  self-advancement  in 
one's  profession. 

HON.  JUDGE  DUNKIN 

Was  born  at  Walworth,  London,  England,  on  the  25th  September,  1812.  He

JOHN  McDonald. 

Little  need  bie  said  in  a  work  like  this,  as  a  Gazettekr  of  Montreal,  regarding  the 
indispensability  tvnd  importance  of  the  services  of  expert  auditors  and  accountants 
in  all  centres  of  commercial  activity.  In  Montreal  there  are  gentlemen  of  education 
and  ability  engaged  in  this  prominent  pursuit,  and  Mr.  Joiin  McDonald  is  one  of  the 
longest  established  auditors  and  accountants  in  the  city.  This  popular  gentleman 
began  business  in  1867,  and  his  many  sterling  qualities  and  rare  executive  ability 
were  soon  recogriized.  The  leading  merchants,  corporations  and  banks  gave  him 
first  place  and  honored  him  with  their  confidence.  Mr.  McDonald  is  an  expert  at 
examining  books,  and  makes  a  specialty  of  auditing  accounts  and  statements  of  joint 
stock  companies,  corporations  and  private  firms.  Mr.  McDonald  is  popular  in  social 
and  commercial  circles  ;  he  is  honored  by  the  position  of  Vice-President  of  the 
Chartered  Accountants'  Association  of  the  City,  and  is  esteemed  by  all  with  whom 
he  comes  in  contact. 

F.  X.  PRIEUR. 
The  subject  of  this  short  notice  was  bornjSth  May,  1814,  at  St.  Polycarpe.  He  was 
at  the  head  of  a  flourishing  establishment  at  that  place  when  the  Rebellion  broke  out« 
He  was  made  a  prisoner  2fst  January,  1839,  condemned  with  many  of  his  co-patriots 
and  sentenced  to  exile  in  Australia.  He  wrote  a  large  work  on  his  voyage  to  and 
from  that  Colony  when  he  returned,  some  years  after,  from  banishment.  In  i860, 
Sir  George  Cartier  made  him  Warden  of  the  Reformatory  School,  now  the  Penitentiary, 
at  St.  Vincent  de  Paul.  In  1870,  he  was  made  Director  of  Provincial  Penitentiaries 
He  retired  in  1876,  when  his  wife  died,  to  Montreal,  on  a  pension,  and  died  ist

ALDERMAN  CLENDINNENG. 
He  was  born  at"^  Cavan,  Ireland,  in  1833,  and  remained  there  till  1847,  i"  which 
year  he  came  to  Montreal.  In  1852,  he  entered  as  an  employee  the  foundry  of  Wm. 
Rodden,  and  very  soon  became  his  partner.  He  is  a  Governor  of  the  House  of 
Industry  and  Refuge,  also  of  the  General  Hospital,  and  is  a  member  of  the  Chamber 
of  Commerce.  He  was  elected  in  1888  for  St.  Antoine  quarter  in  the  City  Council, 
and  still  represents  that  ward.  His  business,  in  which  his  son  is  now  associated,  is 
of  immense  proportions.  Mr.  Wm.  Clendinneng,  jun.,is  one  of  the  best  business  men 
in  the  city,  and  the  success  of  the  firm  is  much  owing  to  his  energy  and  talents- 
This  firm  is  the  only  one  in  Canada  that  manufactures  pipes  from  four  inches 
to  sixty  inches  diameter — cast  faucets  down.  They  are  identified  with  the  Canada 
Pipe  and  Foundry  Co.,  of  which  Mr.  Clendinneng,  jun.,  is  the  President.  They  have 
immense  works  in  William,  Ann  and  Shannon  streets.  Alderman  Clendinneng 
Went  to  Europe  with  Alderman  Hurteau  and  floated  the  last  civic  loan  most 
successfully.  Altogether,  Mr.  Clendinneng  is  one  who  has  greatly  developed  the 
trade  of  Montreal,  and  to  him  may  its  inhabitants  look  with  pride  for  many  improve- 
ments in  the  civic  regulations  and  bye-laws. 


LOUIS  PAYETTE. 


GAZEITF.KR  OF  MONTREAL.  S^S 


LOUIS  I'AVETTE, 

He  was  horn  at  St.  Siilpice,  29th  September,  1S31,  and  educated  at  L'Assomption 
College.  After  leaving  college  he  entered  Mr.  Beaupre's  employ,  who  was  a  general 
merchant.  After  four  years  he  joined  his  father  as  a  Contractor.  He  afterwards 
visited  the  United  S;  .tes,  and  there  married  Kmily  Lambert.  A  few  years  after  he 
returned  to  Canada  and  joined  the  Grand  Trunk  Railway  Company,  where  he 
remained  until  February,  1864.  Then  he  received  the  appointment  of  Clovernor  of 
the  Montreal  Gaol  by  the  Dorion-Macdonald  Government,  and  remained  so  until 
his  death,  which  took  place  April  3Cth,  1891.     He  had  four  daughters  and  one  son. 

The  Author  of  these  sketches  was  appointed  Protestant  Chaplain  a  few  months 
after  Mr.  Payette's  a])pointmcnt  as  (iovernor,  and  during  the  long  series  of  twenty- 
seven  years  they  always  maintained  the  greatest  cordiality  and  friendship.  It  is  to 
the  credit  of  the  deceased  to  say  that  during  that  long  period  there  has  never  been 
the  very  slightest  disagreement  on  the  internal  arrangements  or  the  religious  depart- 
ments of  the  Institution. 

yiv.  Payette  was  of  a  kindly  disj)osition,  yet  he  could  be  stern  and  firm  when 
occasion  required.  For  two  years  before  his  deatli,  Mr.  Payette  was  a  great  sufferer, 
and  on  April  29th,  1891,  he  cjuielly  died,  conscious  to  the  last,  surrounded  by  his 
sorrowing  family  and  friends.  He  had  the  high  distinction  of  being  visited  by  that 
good  man,  Archbishop  Fabre,  during  his  illness,  who  administered  to  him  the  last 
and  solemn  rites  of  his  Church.  'J'he  funeral  was  one  of  the  largest  which  had  taken 
place  in  Montreal  for  many  years.  Everyone  was  there— for  everyone  had  a  kindly 
remembrance  of  ''  Louis  Payette."  His  son,  of  the  same  name,  is  the  agent  on  St. 
Paul  street  of  a  very  large  manufacturing  firm  of  Ontario  dealing  in  all  kinds  of  iron 
ware  and  machinery.

through  liis  curriculum  with  great  success,  made,  on  account  of  his  proficiency, 
two  years  study  into  one,  and  received  prizes  for  both.  He  was  admitted  to  the 
study  of  the  Law  in  1851,  and  studied  with  ^Tr.  S.  Robinson  in  St.  Therese,  and  the 
remainder  of  his  time  with  Messrs.  Lafrenaye  tS:  Papin.  He  was  admitted  to  prac- 
tice his  profession  in  1855,  and  successively  was  in  partnership  with  Messrs.  Du- 
hamel,  Bourgeau  and  Joseph  Papin,  and  at  the  time  of  his  la.Mented  and  terrible 
death  with  his  brother,  Mr,  F.  X.  Archambault,  the  present  well-known  lawyer  of 
that  name,  and  who  is  one  of  the  Counsel  of  the  l&gt;ar  for  the  District  of  Montreal. 
He  made  a  conspicuous  mark  in  his  ])rofession,  and  acquired  the  reputation  of  a 
first-class  orator.  He  was  elected  to  the  City  Council  in  1864  for  the  East  Ward. 
'J'he  papers  of  the  day  give  an  account  of  his  awful  death,  -.vhich  caused  quite  a  sen- 
sation then,  as  Mr.  Archambault  was  universally  beloved,  and  was  one  of  the  hand- 
somest men  of  Montreal,  "  le  beau  Canadien,"  as  he  was  called,  and  cut  off  in  the 
vigor  of  manhood  and  in  the  prospect  of  health,  wealth  and  happiness.  The  follow- 
ing is  extracted  from  the  Mincrvc.  The  accident  of  the  explosion  of  the  magnificent 
steamer  "St.  John  "  happened  on  October  29lh,  1865,  when  Mr.  Archambault,  his 
young  wife  and  little  girl  were  killed. 

"  La  famille  Archambault  passa  la  journee  de  samedi  a  Albany,  et  y  prit  le 
meme  soir  le  vapeur  '  St.  John,'  pour  se  rendre  a  New  York. 

"  On  pense  generalement  que  la  famille  etait  encore  dans  le  chambre  lorsque 
I'explosion  a  eu  lieu.  Nos  depechcs  nous  apprennent  que  Madame  Archambault  et  sa 
petite  fille  sont  mortes  instantanement;  M.  Archambault  aurait  suivecu  plusieurs  heures. 

"  ^L  Archambault,  avocat  de  talents,  et  jeune  encore,  avait  un  bel  avenir  que 
cette  horrible  catastrophe  est  venue  briser ;  ses  belles  qualiles  lui  avaient  fait  un 
nombreux  cercle  d'amis  profondemcnt  desoles  de  cette  fin  tragique.  Le  defunt 
occupait  une  position  avantageuse  parmi  ses  concitoyens,  et,  comme  conseiller 
de  ville,  joussait  d'une  juste  popularite." 

From  VOrdre  we  also  find  that,  when  the  bodies  arrived  at  the  Bonaven- 
ture  station,  "  Une  foule  de  250  ou  300  jjcrsonnes,  dans  laquelle  on  remarquait 
le  Mairc,  I'hon.  M.  Dorion,  I'elite  du  Harreau  et  de  la  Corporation  attendait,  la 
tristesse  sur  la  figure  et  la  sympathie  dans  le  coeur,  I'arrivee  des  chers  defunts ; 
cette  reunion  tout-a-fait  spontanee  altestait  le  degre  de  veritable  estime  dont 
jouissaient  AL   Cyrille  Archambault  et  sa  jeune  compagne." 

Mr.  Y.  X.  Archamhault,  his  brother,  was  born  at  St.  Vincent  de  Paul. 
He  also  studied  at  St.  Therese.  He  was  admitted  to  the  Bar  in  the  year  1836,  '&lt;Su'3 
and  has  ever  since  enjoyed  a  very  large  practice.  He  entered  Parliament  as  the 
representative  of  Vaudreuil,  but  soon  gave  up  politics  for  his  profession.  He  has 
been  elected  to  many  of  the  honorary  positions  in  the  Bar  of  Montreal,  and  '^till 
has  one  of  the  largest  clientele  in  the  city

JAMES  O'DONELL. 

How  many  citizens  of  Montreal  have  ever  visited  the  vault  of  our  noble  Notre  Dame 
Church  ?  There  alone,  near  one  of  the  square  pillars  of  this  grand  edifice,  about  the 
centre  of  the  church,  lie  the  ashes  of  tlie  architect  and  builder  of  this  sacred  and 
solid  house  of  worship.  One  has  to  grope  in  the  dark  to  find  the  place,  which  is 
surrounded  by  a  cast  iron  fence.  Above,  attaclied  to  a  supporting  rough  jjlaster 
square  column,  is  aftixed  a  small,  cheap,  white  marble  slab,  with  letters  cut  in,  in" 
scribed  as  follows  : —

James  O'Donell,  Esquire, 
Architect,  born  in  Ireland, 

Who  died  in  this  city 
The  28th  January,  1S30, 
In  the  56th  year  uf  his  age. 

"  He  labored  five  years  on  this  church,  giving  the  plans  and 
directing  the  works  wuh  zeal  antl  intelligence.  Having 
embraced  the  Catholic  faith,  he  desired  that  his 
remains  might  rest  beneath.  His  disinterestedness, 
his  talents  and  his  probity  of  character  were  worthy 
the  esteem  of  this  parish  ;  and  the  church-wardens 
have  Consecrated  this  monument  to  his  memory. 

"  Requiescat  in  pace-" 

Such,  in  French,  is  the  tablet,  in  an  out-of-the-way  place,  seldom  visited,  and  the 
manner  of  recording  the  achievement  of  an  architect  who  certainly  deserved  some- 
thing more  handsome.  Why  not,  at  leas',  place  some  rich  mural  design  on  the 
ground  floor  of  the  church?  Let  the  Irish  Catliolic  ]:)eople  of  tlie  City  bestir  them- 
selves and  raise  some  better  monument  to  him  who  was  an  honor  to  the  land  of  his 
birth.

the  charge  of  Cotte  Street  Ciuirch,  Montreal.  He  had  hardly  enteied  on  the  duties 
of  his  charge  when  he  was  selected  to  go  to  Trois-Pistoles  and  other  places  below 
Quebec,  in  the  affairs  of  the  Church,  and  was  there  cut  down  by  the  terrible  scourge 
of  cholera,  which  was  then  devastating  the  country,  and  died  on  the  13th  of  Septem- 
ber, 1851.  As  it  was  imi)Ossil)lc  to  convey  the  infected  body  to  Montreal,  he  was

SIMON  V  A  LOIS 

Was  born  at  Pointc  Claire  in  1791.  At  twelve  years  of  age  he  came  to  ^[ontreal 
and  joined  the  store  of  one  of  the  ])rincipal  merchants  of  the  day.  He  worked  with 
such  energy,  and  was  so  industrious  in  the  business  he  had  adopted  (a  tanner),  that 
he  retired  with  a  considerable  fortune  in  1837.  He  then  built  at  the  foot  of  St.  Mary's 
Current  a  fine  mansion,  with  one  of  the  best  views  in  Montreal.  Two  or  three  farms 
in  this  vicinity  belonged  to  him,  whicli  have  lately  by  his  son  and  daughter — Abbe 
Valois  and  Madame  Lussier — been  sold  at  an  immense  value.  The  Sisters,  or  "  Les 
Sceurs  du  St.  Noms  de  Jssus  et  Marie"  were  established  by  him  on  one  of  these 
farms.  There  Mr.  Valois  displayed  his  generosity.  He  contributed  greatly  to  the 
building  of  tliC  Institution.  When  he  died,  the  Bishop  officiated,  and  more  than  fifty 
priests  occupied  1)Oth  sides  of  the  chancel  and  sang  alternately  with  the  principal 
voices  of  Notre  Dame  Church  and  the  Sisters.  Abbe  Valois  still  lives  in  the  house 
his  father  built.  He  was  instrumental  in  bringing  the  Carmelite  Nuns  to  Hoche- 
laga,  but  they,  like  the  others  across  the  road,  must  soon  leave,  to  give  place  to  the 
march  of  trade  and  business,  which  will  require  property  for  wharf  and  building 
purposes.

of  1837-38,  and  defended  with  much  vigor  and  ccldt  and  in  connection  with  the  late 
Judge  Dtummond,  many  of  tiie  Patriots  accused  of  high  treason.  His  name  appears

Queen's  Jjcnch  in  1858.  He  was  a  very  stern  yet  just  dispenser  of  Criminal  Law,  and 
his  ai)pearance  on  the  Judicial  Bench  at  the  opening  of  a  term  of  Queen's  Bench  was 
the  sure  sign  that  sentences  at  its  close  would  be  long  and  severe.  The  Judge  died 
in  1S76. 

DR.  PERIilGO 

Was  born  in  Montreal  in  1846.  His  father  was  John  Perrigo  and  his  mother  Eleanor

General  Manager,  and  in  18S4  was  advanced  to  the  high  position  of  Vice  President 
of  this  great  concern,  and  is  nov  the  President  of  the  Road.  Mr.  Van  Home's 
remarkable  career  and  gradual  rising  up  the  ladder  of  promotion  should  be  a  good 
incentive  to  others  to  go  and  do  likewise.  He  is  one  of  the  best  examples  of  a  truly 
self-made  man.

LA  SALLE. 

"RoMKRT  Cavamkr  I)f,  LA  Sai,lk  was  a  native  of  Rouen,  wliere  he  was  born  al)c)Ul 
1635.  He  was  thoro  ighly  educated  by  the  Jesuits,  having  been  intended  to  be  a 
member  of  that  community.  He  left  it,  however,  and  about  the  year  1667  i)roceeded 
to  Canada,  in  the  capacity  of  a  merchant.  In  tliis  career  lie  appears  to  have  been 
eminently  successful ;  but  he  aimed  at  still  higher  objects,  iiaving  formed  to  himself 
the  magnificent  scheme  of  opening  a  way  to  China  and  Japan  ihrougji  the  lakes  of 
Canada,  which  he,  not  unreasonably  for  that  time,  imagined  must  send  off  navigable 
wa'.ers  into  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Mr.  Bibaud,  author  of  a  history  of  this  country, 
says,  '  He  was  learned,  active,  enteri)rising  and  animated  with  the  double  desire  of 
rising  to  fame  and  fortune,' 

"  La  Salle  visited  his  native  country  in  1677.  On  his  return  he  set  about  execut- 
ing tiie  great  scheme  he  had  long  meditated,  of  tracing  the  river  Mississippi  to 
its  outlet  in  the  Atlantic,  or,  as  it  miglit  be,  in  the  (lulf  of  Mexico.  l''or  this  purpose 
he  caused  to  be  constructed  a  vessel  of  sixty  tons  burden,  about  two  leagues  above 
the  Falls  of  Niagara.  On  the  7th  of  August,  1679,  the  vessel,  with  thirty-four  per. 
sons  on  board,  a  suitable  proportion  of  whom  were  priests  for  the  instruction  of  the 
Indians,  was  launched  on  Lake  Erie,  and  steered  towards  ]\[ackinaw.  In  this 
unknown  and  most  hazardous  navigation.  La  Salle  displayed  unbounded  .esolu- 
tion,  and  not  less  address,  both  in  cheering  on  iiis  own  men  amidst  all  their  labors 
and  perils,  and  still  more  in  securing  the  favor  of  the  savages,  with  wliom,  to  his 
everlasting  honor  be  it  mentioned,  he  was  never  in  all  his  lifetime,  except  once,  in 
danger  of  coming  to  a  rupture.  He  arrived  at  Mackinaw  on  the  27th  of  August,  and 
in  a  few  weeks  after  anchored  at  a  small  Island  in  the  mouth  of  (Ireen  l]ay.  Here  he 
loaded  the  vessscl  with  furs,  and  dispatched  her  to  the  head  of  the  Falls. 

"  He  then  proceeded  in  canoes  along  the  eastern  and  southern  shores  of  Lake 
Michigan,  to  the  St.  Joseph,  then  called  the  Miami,  a  name  now  appropriated  to  the 
river  falling  into  the  south-western  angle  of  Lake  Erie.  All  the  preparations  being 
made,  they  took  their  departure  from  the  island  on  the  19th  h^eptember.  Nightfall 
came  on  before  they  reached  the  nearest  part  of  the  continent,  which  was  twelve  miles 
distant. 

"Trusting  their  fragile  canoes  again  to  the  waves,  they  were  soon  overtaken  by 
new  disasters.  Clouds  gathered  over  them,  winds  blew  angrily,  and,  deluged  with 
rain  and  sleet,  they  were  glad  to  seek  safety  on  a  naked  rock  for  two  days,  and  no 
other  shelter  than  their  blankets.  At  the  end  of  another  day  they  were  in  so  great 
danger  in  attempting  to  land,  that  the  Sieur  de  la  Salle  leaped  into  the  water  with  his 
men,  and  assisted  them  to  drag  his  canoe  ashore.  His  example  was  followed  by 
tliose  in  the  other  canoes.  They  landed  somewhere  in  the  neighborhood  of  the 
river  Milwaukie. 

"  By  this  time  the  provisions  were  exhausted,  but  they  had  seen  Indians,  and 
presumed  their  habitations  were  at  hand.  Three  men  were  sent  with  the  calumet  of 
peace,  to   search   for  corn.     They   came   to  a  deserted  village,  where  they  found 


GAZl'.TTKER  OK  MONTREAL.  51I 

abundance  of  corn,  of  wliich  they  took  as  much  as  tiiey  wanted,  and  left  sucli  articles 
as  the  natives  valued  in  exchange.  Before  night  the  Indians  Jiovcred  sur.piciously 
around  the  party  at  the  canoes  ;  but  when  the  calumet  of  peace  uas  presented,  they 
showed  themselves  friends,  and  entertained  their  visitors  with  dances  and  songs. 
They  were  so  well  satisfied  with  the  goods  left  in  the  village,  that  the  next  day  they 
brought  more  corn  and  a  supply  of  deer,  for  which  they  were  amply  rewarded.  This 
proof  of  human  sympathy,  even  in  men  called  savages,  was  a  sunbeam  in  the  path  of 
the  weary  voyagers. 

"  After  some  further  adventures  of  the  same  nature,  I^a  Salle  and  his  company 
arrived  on  the  ist  November  at  the  mouth  of  the  St.  Joseph,  where  they  spent  the 
remainder  of  that  month.  On  the  3rd  of  December  they  ascended  the  river  in  canoes, 
with  a  view  to  reach  the  portage  leading  into  the  Ivankakoo,  or  eastern  branch  of  the 
Illinois.  On  the  ist  of  January,  1680,  they  reached  Peoria,  situated  on  the  last- 
named  river,  and  set  about  constructing  a  tort.  At  last,  after  several  changes,  they 
found  what  they  considered  a  tavorable  position,  and  built  upon  it  Fort  St.  Louis, 
which  may  be  considered  the  headquarters  of  La  Salle  during  the  remainder  of  his 
wanderings.  The  faithful  Tout  generally  iield  the  command  during  the  long  and 
frequent  occasions  of  his  own  absence.  On  tlie  aSt.i  of  February,  La  Salle  set  out 
on  an  overland  journey  to  Frontenac,  now  Kingston,  still  bent  on  making  further 
preparations  for  his  voyage  of  discovery  on  the  Mississippi.  Various  disagreeable 
incidents  occurred  on  this  long  and  perilous  journey  ;  but  the  chief  calamity  that 
befelhim  was  the  murder  of  his  faithful  attendant.  P'atiier  Gabriel,  who  fell  a  sacrifice 
to  the  cruel  suspicions  of  the  Lidians.  Three  young  warriors  belonging  to  a  tribe 
hostile  to  that  whose  friendship  tlie  travellers  had  gained,  met  the  venerable  Father 
in  one  of  his  solitary  rambles,  and  murdered  him  in  cold  blood. 

•  On  arriving  at  Fort  Frontenac,  he  appears  to  have  spent  several  montlis  in  mak- 
ing further  preparations  for  his  expedition  to  the  south,  and  also  in  making  proper 
arrangements  with  his  creditors,  with  whom  his  extended  schemes  of  discovery 
brought  him  sometimes  into  difficulty,  but  whose  claims  he  satisfied  by  suitable 
sacrifices  of  his  property.  Then  he  proceeded  to  Fort  St.  Louis.  On  the  6th  of 
February  he  at  last  floated  on  the  bosom  of  the  long  sought  Mississippi.  On  the  same 
day  he  passed  the  mouth  of  the  Missouri,  distinguished  by  its  powerful  current  and 
muddy  waters.  Father  Zenobe,  whose  notes  are  incorporated  in  Le  Clercq's  Etahlisse. 
incut  dc  la  T'oi,  is  copious  in  his  description  of  the  various  tribes  of  Indians  whom 
they  found  on  the  banks,  and  whose  friendsiiip  they  were  careful  in  cultivating. 
Then  they  passed  the  mouth  of  the  Arkansas.  On  they  6th  of  April  they  arrived  at  a 
triple  portion  of  the  river,  soon  after  which  the  water  became  first  brackish,  and  then 
sait,  when  the  broad  Gulf  of  Mexico  appeared  in  view. 

"  He  retraced  his  steps,  and  reached  Quebec  in  November,  1683,  and  embarked 
for  France,  where  he  was  welcomed  by  Seignelay  as  "the  delight  of  the  New  World," 
and  received  a  commission,  according  to  which  all  the  French  and  natives  of  the 
country,  from  Fort  St.  Louis  to  New  Biscay,  were  placed  under  his  authority.     An

diately arose  between  La  Salle  and  the  Naval  Commander,  Beaujeu. 

"  After  much  quarrelling,  La  Salle  determined,  January  i2tli,  1681,  to  seek  by  land 
the  country  of  Illinois,  and  thence  to  pass  to  Canada.  He  set  out  with  sixteen  men, 
following  the  track  of  the  buffalo,  passed  the  basin  of  the  Colorado,  and  reached  a 
branch  of  the  Trinity  river.  They  went  in  groups  ;  and  the  malignity  of  two  men, 
Duhantand  L'Archeveque,  who  had  embarked  their  capital  in  the  enterprise,  found 
an  opportunity  for  gratification.  They  quarrelled  and  murdered  a  nephew  of  La 
Salle.  He  suspected  the  fact,  and  asked  one  of  ihem  respecting  the  fate  of  his 
relative,  when  the  other  fired  upon  him  from  an  ambush,  and  he  fell  dead.  '  Such 
was  the  end,'  says  Bancroft,  'of  tliis  daring  adventurer.'  "

Montreal,  and  Dr.  Reddy  devoted  himself  to  the  care  of  the  sufferers.  For  thirty 
years  he  worked  as  perhaps  no  other  physician  did,  but  in  1883  his  health  gave  way 
and  he  went  to  Europe  to  recuperate,  but  all  in  vain.  He  died  23rd  January,  1884, 
in  Dublin,  Ireland.  In  1856,  he  received  the  degree  of  M.D.  from  McGill  College,

in  his  practice,  while  William  B.  S.  Reddy  is  one  of  our  well-known  notaries.  He  is

ERNEST  IDLER 

Was  one  of  the  oldest  citizens  of  German  parentage  residing  in  Montreal.  He  was 
born  in  Wurtemburg,  July  16,  1796.  When  he  came  in  181 1  to  this  city,  Montreal 
had  not  more  than  15,000  inhabitants.  McGill  street  had  only  one  building  on  it, 
and  that  was  occupied  by  a  negro.  When  he  arrived  in  Montreal  he  learned  the 
butcher's  trade,  and  followed  the  business  of  meat  packer  and  dealer  together  with 
produce  dealer.  This  he  continued  for  fifty  years.  He  retired  in  1875,  after  making 
a  large  fortune.  In  the  great  fire  of  1852  he  lost  considerably.  The  American 
second  war  was  just  breaking  out,  and  although  only  seventetr.  years  of  age  Mr. 
Idler  volunteered  his  services,  as  he  also  did  in  the  Rebellion  of  1837-38.  He  was 
also  often  asked  to  be  Councillor  or  Alderman,  but  always  refused.  When  the 
German  Society  of  Montreal  was  founded  in  1835  he  was  the  first  Treasurer, 
afterwards  he  was  the  President.  When  the  Lutheran  Church  was  formed  in  Mon- 
treal in  1857  he  wa-  one  of  its  founders.  His  life  was  an  even  and  untarnished 
one,  and  he  saw  his  adopted  city  grow  up  till  it  now  is  within  the  ninth  largest  city

THOMAS  A.  GIBSON,  M.A., 

Was  born  July  5,  1804,  in  Forfar,  the  county  town  of  Angus-shire,  Scotland.  In  the 
beginning  of  January,  1813,  his  parents  removed  to  Tain.  In  May,  1822,  the  subject  of 
this  sketch  was  appointed  Master  of  Nigg  Parish  School.  .  He  was  then  not  eighteen 
years  old.  In  the  Session  of  1824-5,  he  attended  the  Humanity  (Latin)  and  (ireek 
classes  under  Professors  Piilans  and  Dunbar  respectively.  He  was  obliged  to  leave 
for  home  (Tain)  a  fortnight  before  the  close  of  the  College.  Professor  Piilans  in  the 
forenoon  drew  the  attention  of  the  class  to  the  necessity  of  his  availing  himself  of 
the  opportunity  of  returning  home  by  the  fortnightly  coaster,  and  presented  him  with 
the  prizes  which  he  had  won — 9  volumes.  He  kindly  addressed  lum,  wishing  him 
speedy  restoration  to  health.  He  left  the  class-room  with  the  volumes  under  his  arms, 
amidst  the  applause  of  some  130  fellow  students,  and  posted  to  Leith  for  the  vessel. 

We  will  now  give  the  dates  of  Mr.  (libson's  professional  career,  and  I  may 
state  that  the  writer  and  author  of  this  (Ia/kttkkr  is  his  oldest  \)n\n\  in  Montreal. 
He  taught  iiim  in  Scotland  from  the  year  1840  to  1843.  ^^  '^'-'Id  '^'^s  Parish  School

sity during  Session  1824-5  !  'i-tled  as  Tutor  to  the  family  of  Captain  Spalding,  Gov- 
ernor of  Fort  Augustus,  Inverness-sliire,  1826  ;  attended  Edinburgh  University  during 
Session  1826-7.  He  held  the  Grammar  School  of  Wick,  County  town  of  Caithness, 
from  October,  1827,  to  October,  1833  ;  held  the  Mastership  of  C!auvin's,  Duddingston, 
Edinburgh,  from  November,  1833.  till  September,  1843,  when  he  left  for  Montreal 
to  be  first  Assistant  Master  in  the  High  School ;  was  one  of  the  Masters  of  that 
Institution  from  December,  1843,  till  July,  1868,  a  long  period  of  twenty-five  years. 

During  iiis  incumbency  in  Wick,  he  attended  Edinburgh  University  for  the 
Session  of  1832-3.  In  1868,  after  accepting  a  yearly  pension  from  McCMIl  Univer- 
sity for  his  long  and  faithful  services,  he  engaged  in  private  tuition,  and  had  the 
satisfaction  of  superintending  the  studies  of  young  gentlemen  and  L  dies  to  the  num- 
ber of  upwards  of  one  hundred  for  nearly  fifteen  years.  Some  of  these  students 
having  a  view  to  the  Ministry,  Medicine  or  Teaching,  have  for  years  been  occu- 
pying responsible  positions. 

In  connection  with  his  residence  in  Montreal,  it  may  be  mentioned  that  he 
officiated  for  about  twenty  years  as  Superintendent  of  St.  Paul's  Sunday  School, 
during  the  entire  incumbency  of  Drs.  McGill  and  Snodgrass,  and  a  short  period  of 
Dr.  Jenkins,  and  for  upwards  of  forty  years  as  a  member  of  the  Kirk  Session  and  its 
Clerk.  For  twenty-five  years  he  was  Secretary  of  the  Protestant  Board  of  F^xam- 
iners  of  Montreal,  and  till  tlie  new  regulations  came  into  force. 

Mr.  Gibson,  like  his  brother  Gilbert,  was  much  given  to  literature.  He  edited 
for  years  the  organ  of  the  Presbyterians.  He  published  some  most  interesting  edu- 
cational volumes,  such  as  Gibson's  "  Latin,  Greek  and  F'rench  Vocabulary."  He 
wrote  an  excellent  work  on  Canada  and  many  other  contributions  to  the  Canadian 
Press.     His  "  Etymological  Geography  "  has  never  been  surpassed.    The  great  work

hard  at  it  over  forty  years  ago),  is  a  Tyro's  Latin  Dictionary,  which  will,  if  ever 
printed,  be  the  finest  work  of  its  kind  for  all  young  students.  .\[r.  Gibson  has 
placed  it  in  the  writer's  hands  to  lay  it  before  some  large  publishing  house,  and 
has  requested  him  to  collaborate  and  edit  its  pages  tlirough  the  press.

WILLIAM  WILSON, 

Who  sustained  fat  il  injiiiies  sonic  time  ago  by  being  struck  by  the  shaft  of  a  sleigli 
in  St.  James  Street,  died  lately  at  liis  residence  in  Lagauclietiere  street.  The  news 
was  received  with  much  regret  by  a  huge  circle  of  friends,  but  esjiecially  among 
the  Irish  citizens,  by  whom  he  was  highly  respected  and  esteemed.  Mr.  Wilson  was 
a  i)ublic-s|)iiite(l  citizen,  and  his  fellow  countrymen  always  found  him  ready  to  assist 
in  any  undertaking  which  tended  to  further  the  material  and  social  interests  of  the 
men  of  his  race.  In  turn,  he  was  President  of  the  St.  Patrick's  National  .Societv,  the 
Emerald  Snowshoe  Club,  the  Shamrock  Lacrosse  Club,  and  was  connected  with 
other  societies.  For  many  years  he  was  an  active  member  of  the  Junior  Conservative 
Club,  and  was  also  President  of  the  I-orne  Fish  and  (iame  Club.  He  was  in  his 
seventy-fourth  year,  and  was  a  native  of  Fnnis,  (J(j.  Clare.  In  his  early  years  he 
served  as  a  member  of  the  ?.\\\\  Regiment,  and  some  thirty  years  ago  he  retired  on  a 
life  pension.  He  then  went  inio  business,  and,  being  successful,  retired  many  years 
ago  with  a  competency.      He  fust  came  to  .Montreal  in  1852. 

1!ENAL\II  GI1J15,  SEN., 

Was  born  in  Northumberland,  England,  May  6ih,  1755.  Came  to  Montreal  in  1774, 
and  in  1775  opened  the  business,  which  still  continues  (perhaps  the  oldest  of  any) 
in  the  City  of  Montreal.  He  retired  from  active  business  in  1815,  the  year  of  the 
Battle  of  Waterloo.  His  two  sons,  Thomas  Gibb  and  James  Diuican  (libb,  succeeded 
him.  In  1S20,  he  was  a  Director  of  the  "Savings  Bank."  He  commemorated  his 
jubilee  of  coming  to  Montreal  in  1774  in  1S24  by  a  grand  entertainment  given  to  the 
])rincipal  citizens,  where  "  the  Band  of  the  70th  Regiment  (according  to  the  account 
found  in  the  Herald  of  that  date)  added  much  to  the  enjoyment  of  the  company." 
He  died  in  1826. 

Isaac  J.  Gibb,  one  of  the  best  known  men  in  connection  with  the  English  Church 
(with  his  estimable  wife,  the  benevolent  and  Christian  Mrs.  I.  J.  Gibl),  of  Como),  is 
descended  from  this  family  ;  also  the  late  Charles  Gibb,  of  Abbotsford,  who  did  so 
much  regarding  the  pomology  of  our  country,  and  who  went  even  to  Russia  in  the 
pursuit  of  information.  One  of  the  daughters,  Elizabeth,  married  James  Orkney, 
whose  daughter,  Miss  Orkney,  now  resides  in  the  Gibb  mansion,  St.  Catherine 
street. 

His  son,  Benaiah,  faithfully  carried  out  the  ideas  and  opinions  of  his  father. 
At'ter  an  even  and  uneventful  political  and  civic  life,  he  died  in  Montreal,  ist  June, 
1877.  By  his  will  (now  long  ago  acted  on)  he  left  all  his  pictures  and  statues  to  form 
the  nucleus  of  an  Art  Gallery  for  the  citizens  of  Montreal.  What  puzzles  the  writer 
is,  that  left  to  the  city,  at  least  to  the  x'\rt  Association,  the  public  should  be  compelled

L.  D.  LAFONTAINE,  M.D. 

His  death  occurred  a  few  days  ago  at  St.  Kdouard  de  Napierville.  The  deceased 
gentleman  represented  Napierville  County  in  the  Legislature,  as  a  Liberal,  from  1870 
to  1881.  Dr.  Lafontaine  took  a  prominent  i)art  in  the  political  troubles  of  1838, 
and  was  sentenced  to  death,  but  subsecpienlly  pardoned.  He  had  long  been  ill.  Last 
autumn  he  returned  t'rom  Kurope  after  an  unsuccessful  search  for  relief,  and  had 
since  been  under  the  care  of  Drs.  Brosseau  and  Roltot,  of  this  city.  He  leaves  seven 
children,  one  of  whom  is  Mr,  Eugene  Lafontaine,  advocate,  and  ex-member  of  Parlia- 
ment for  Napierville.  Mr.  Lafontaine  once  was  partner  with  the  well-known  Alder- 
man Prefontaine,  which  gave  occasion  to  the  Author  one  day  to  say,  when  visiting 
their  office,  and  finding  first  the  junior  partner's  office  and  then  behind  it  the  senior's, 
"  The  fountain  stands  before  the  fountain."  He  was  born  at  St.  Edouard,  on  the 
27th  November,  1857,  and  educated  in  Montreal  College  and  at  Laval  University, 
where  he  was  the  prize  medalist.  He  married  Elmire,  daughter  of  L.  J.  Moll,  of 
Berthier.  He  was  called  to  the  Bar  of  the  Province  of  Quebec,  in  1879,  and  had 
the  high  distinction  of  being  made  a  Doctor  of  Civil  Law — the  degree  having  been 
conferred  on  him  by  Laval  University  in  1881.  He  was  first  returned  to  the  Legis- 
lative Assembly  at  the  last  General  Election,  but  has  since  retired  from  i)olitics,  and 
is  entirely  engrossed  in  the  duties  of  his  ever-increasing  practice.  Other  children 
of  Dr.  Lafontaine  are:  Mr.  Ulric  Lafontaine,  of  the  Court  House;  Mr.  Emery 
Eafontaine,  civil  engineer,  of  Quebec,  and  Guslave  Lafontaine,  M.l).,  of  St.  Joseph, 
Kansas. 

LAURENT  OLIVIER  DAVID 

Was  the  son  of  Major  Stanislas  David  and  Elizabeth  Treniblay.  He  was  born  at 
Sault  au  Recollet  in  1840,  and  educated  at  the  College  of  St.  Therese.  He  studied 
Law  with  the  late  Judge  Mousseau,  and  became  his  partner  when  admitted  to  the  Bar 
in  1864.  He  established  with  Mr.  Mousseau  and  Mr.  Desbarats  the  V Opinion 
Publique,  which  was  a  very  popular  periodical  for  many  years.  He  separated  from 
Mr.  Mousseau  and  left  L' Opinion  Publique  on  account  of  differences  of  opinion  aris- 
ing among  the  proprietors  on  the  question  of  Pacific  Scandal.  He  then  established 
with  Mr.  C  Beausoleill,  in  1874,  the  Bien  Public,  by  the  writings  of  which  the  Ouimet 
Government  fell  on  the  Tanneries  (Land  Swap)  Scandal,   and  he  originated  a  deter.

known  to  these  who  lived  during  these  burning  times.  He  left  the  Bicn  /'ii/&gt;/ic  in 
1.S76,  because  lie(X)iikl  not  agree  with  the  M&lt;-Kcn/ie  l''ederal  Ciovernnu'nt  at(&gt;ttawa, 
on  the  (lucstion  (jf  Protection.  Mr.  D.ivid  held  the  opinion  that  Protection  was  a 
necessary  thing  to  save  Canada  at  that  time  on  account  of"  the  crisis,  and  that  it  was  the 
duty  of  the  l-'edera!  Oovernmcnt  to  ])iil  our  native  industries  in  a  position  to  compete 
against  all  foreign  ones,  and  thai  Protection  for  Canadian  industries  would  be  good  for 
ten  or  fifteen  years.  These  years  h  ive  jiassed,  and  the  N.P.  still  holds  its  sway,  so  that 
Mr,  David  is  now  in  favor  of  free  trade  with  the  LHiited  State's  and  all  other  coun- 
tries. It  is  as  a  literary  man  that  Mr.  David  is  brst  known  to  the  public.  He  wrote, 
after  having  left  the  Bicn  Public,  a  '.vcll-kiiDWu  work  on  lh;f  Ri'bullion  of  1S37-S, 
and  called  "  Les  Patriotes."  Imoui  that  work  the  authvir  of  th's  (i  \/i' iiki.r  has 
received  more  than  once  immense  benefit  and  lielj)  in  tlie  writing  up  f)f  his 
History  of  the  Montreal  (laol  and  the  i)restnt  work  ;  he  also  published  "  Portraits 
and  JJiographies  "  of  well-kntnvn  Canadians.  He  was  elected  in  1886  to  the  Local 
House  of  Parliament  for  the  Provinci;  of  (Quebec,  and  Deputy  for  Montreal 
East,  and  refused  re-election  in  1890.  He  has  been  President  of  tlie  Associa- 
tion of  St.  jean  Haptiste  since  1S88,  and  no  man  has  done  more  than  he  has 
in  undertaking  to  construct  the  immense  national  building  now  being  erected  in 
St.  Lawrence  street.  His  great  object  in  this  undertaking  is  not  only  a  national 
monument,  but  a  grand  depository  to  do  practical  work  to  his  fellow-country- 
men, so  that  useless  processions  may  be  done  away  with,  and  more  learning 
and  intellectual  development  given  t(j  all  who   will  enter  within  its  halls. 

ANTOINK  ROIJS.SEAU 

Was  born  at  Trois  Pistoles,  March,  1S35.  '^'^  father,  Ant:)ine  Rousseau,  was  the 
maker  of  the  monster  clock,  builtat  (Quebec,  in  1S48.  He  is  of  Norman  descent.  His 
mother  was  Adelaide  St.  Pierre,  of  Ste.  .Anne  la  Pocatiere,  Biittany,  France,  and  the 
saying  below  is  well  exemplified  in  the  subject  of  our  sketch.  We  must  remeinl)er  that 
in  Old  France  they  say,  "  Audacieu.x  comme  un  Normand,  tenace  conuiie  un  ilretou." 
He  was  educated  at  the  Quebec  Seminary  and  St.  Anne's  C!ollege,  and  there  he  car- 
ried off  the  First  Prizes  for  Latin,  Logic  and  Drawing.  \\\  1S63,  he  married  Charlotte 
Ann  Williams,  of  New  Brunswick,  a  descendant  of  thj  United  Empire  Loyalists. 
He  had  oae  son  who  di..'d  of  typh  )id  fever  in  1880. 

Mr.  Rousseau  has  built  several  large  engines,  such  as  that  of  the  steamer 
"  Montmagny,"  also  some  well-known  bridges,  such  as  the  Chaudiere  Bridge  at 
Ottawa,  for  the  Federal  Government.  It  has  gained  hini  much  praise  from  several 
eminent  engineers,  amongst  others  from  Chief  Engineer  Perley,  In  1884,  he 
removed  after  the  destruction  of  his  premises  by  fire  in  Quebec  to  Montreal,  where 
he  is  now  the  controlling  spirit  of  the  Imperial  Bridge  Company.  In  1887,  he  was 
elected  Alderman  for  Hochelaga  Ward,  but  retired  in  order  to  devote  himself  to  the 
ever-increasing  duties  of  his  business.

The  epitaph  on  liis  tombstone  tells  where  lie  was  born  and  the  concluding  event  of 
his  life.  The  grave  is  in  the  old  Military  lUiryiiig  Groiuid  on  the  rajjineaii  Road 
seldom  seen  by  travellers  and  as  seldom  liy  the  citizens  of  .Montreal.  A  square  flat 
stone,  over  a  low  vault  some  two  feet  high,  surrounded  by  an  iron  rail,  and  wliose 
four  cf)ruer  iron  ornaments,  re])resenting  an  acoin,  have  long  since  disapjieared,  but 
which  is  otherwise  in  an  excellent  condition,  is  the  spot  that  visitors  seek  most. 
The  inscription  on  the  top  heavy  slab,  in  dee])  clean  cut  letters,  reads  : — 

"  Ik'neath  tliis  stone  are  deposited  tlie  icniainsof  (Jeorge  Weir.  Escj.,  of  Karnes,  in  lierwiekshire, 
.Scotland,  late  Eieutenant  Jn  Her  Majesty's  32nd,  or  Cornwall  Regiment,  aged  2(j  years,  who  was 
l)arl)arously  murdered  at   .St.  Denis,  Lower  C;!nada.  on  the  2',r.l  of  November,  1837."' 

DAVID   IIANDVSIDE. 

He  was  l)orn  in  iMlinburgh,  the  Capital  of  .Scollaiul,  iilh  August,  1794.  With  his 
two  brothel  .  when  they  weie  all  young  men,  they  left  their  native  land  and  came 
to  Montreal.  'I'hey  b-came  merchants  in  St.  Joseph  stri'ct.  The  two  brothers  after- 
wards owned  and  operated  a  large  distillery  at  I.ongue  Pointe,  the  ruins  of  which 
to-day  are  made  into  fine  stables,  barns  and  oiuhouses  belonging  to  Mr.  Viau,  who 
now  owns  the  property.  David's  Distillery  was  on  .St.  Mary  street,  and  the  foinida- 
tions  and  walls  are  still  seen  in  the  large  tobacco  fictory  op[)osite  Fullum  street. 
He  was  named  a  member  of  the  new  Corporation  of  Montreal  in  1840.  He  married 
Melinda  .Adams,  of  Hurlington,  Vermont,  and  died  15th  March,  ICS55.  His  eldest 
daughter  married  Joseph  Jones,  the  Coroner,  a  man  who,  though  over  eighty  years 
of  age,  is  still  able  to  perform  the  duties  of  his  onerous  profession.  His  son,  Charles 
Handyside,  resides  at  l.achine. 

IIOX.  JOHN  McIXTOSH,  JcN., 

A\'as  born  in  the  Comity  of  Laprairie,  in  1842,  and  is  of  Scotch  |)arentage.    He  early 
engaged  in  farming  and  stock  raising,  being  a  successful  man  in   this  line  of  business 
as  f;ir  back  as  i860.       He  was  for  many  years   the  manager  of  the  Canadian   Meat 
and  Produce  Company,   and  latterly  has  been  extensively  engaged  in  the   export  of 
produce  and  cattle  to  England  and  European  markets.      He  was  first  returned  to  the 
Local   Legislature  for  Compton   in    1886,   and   was  re-elected  at   the   last  General 
Election.     Hi  the  House  he  holds  a  leading  position  as  a  sound,  practical,  common- 
sense   member,   and  when   roused  he  is  able   to  deal  his  adversaries  sharp  cutting 
blows,  all  the  more  effective  because  he  is  generally  well  posted  on  what  he  speaks 
about.     After  the  dismissal  of  the  Mercier  Government  in  December,  1801,  he  was 
chosen  to  represent  the  Protestant  division  of  the  Eastern  Townships,   and  is  now 
(February,  1892)  in  the  Local  Cabinet  of  Quebec,  and  by  the  result   of  the  General 
Elections  of  8th  ISL-v.ch  last  still  remains  in  power.

BAZAR  GKNl^RALE. 

Ix  tliis  age  of  cliange  and  pro&lt;:ress  we  observe  things  never  dreamed  of  in  the  j)lii- 
losophy  of  our  ancestors.  Men  in  the  Iiighest  ranks  of  life,  at  the  close  of  this  cen- 
tury, are  seen  devoting  their  time  and  energy,  not  only  to  literatmc  and  science,  but  to 
the  broad  platform  of  commerce,  and  though  even  yelthe  old  wall  of  partition  between 
])lue  lilood  and  Trade  still  in  many  cases  remains,  the  march  of  progress  is  too  strong 
and  too  overwhelming,  so  that  this  wall  will  soon  totter  down,  and  the  old  antiiialhy 
die  out,  and  labor  in  all  its  mental  and  physical  phases  will  in  no  way  detract  from 
the  man.  1  am  led  to  these  remarks  by  the  heading  of  this  sketch.  Two  years  ago 
two  I'Vcnch  noblemen  determined  to  make  Canada  their  home,  and  they  chose  Mon- 
treal. Le  Comie  de  Sieyes  and  Jiaron  T.ouis  dc  Poliniere  saw  thai  this  Province 
ofleied  special  inducements  for  iheniselves  and  their  families,  but  they  were  men  ol 
advanced  ideas  as  regards  labor,  and  they  conceived  and  have  now  carried  out  the 
development  of  one  of  the  finest  establishments  on  the  Continent  of  America.  It 
consists  of  an  innnense  store  of  all  kinds  of  merchandise,  and  rivals  its  great  Knglish 
one — Morgan's.  The  establishment  is  situated  on  three  streets,  St.  Lawrence,  St. 
Catherine  and  St.  ("harles  Borromee.  It  is  carried  on  in  the  same  manner  as 
Le  i5on  Marclni  of  Paris,  Maccy'sof  New  York,  or  Jordan,  Marsh  iv  Co. 's  of  Boston. 
They  have  taken  this  name  as  the  title  of  the  tirm,  Le  Compagnie  Generale  des 
Bazars,  but  its  popular  name  among  the  citizens  of  Montreal  is  sim]:)ly  The  Bazaar. 

The  building  is  four  stories  h.igh,  of  cut  limestone,  but  what  impresses  one  is  not 
the  out  but  the  inside,  although  the  immense  plate  glass  windows  are  worth  looking 
at.  On  entermg,  the  visitor  or  buyer  finds  himself  in  a  sjjacious  store  where 
he  can  procure  all  kinds  of  family  goods  of  every  make  and  ])rice,  whilst 
opposite  to  this  runs  another  store  as  large,  occupied  entirely  with  gentlemen's 
furnishings  of  all  sorts,  with  every  kinl  of  perfumery  and  all  the  et-ceteras  of  a  refined 
home.  The  elevator  will  then  take  him  to  the  ladies'  dei)artment,  where  one  of  the 
most  comi)lete  assortments  of  furs,  mantles,  boots  and  shoes,  silks  and  everything 
required  by  the  most  fastTdious  dame  can  be  seen  in  abundance  and  at  remarkably 
low  prices. 

The  second  floor  is,  ])erha])s,  for  the  ladies  the  goal  of  their  desires.  Here  are 
the  drawing  rooms  of  the  Parisian  artiste  who  superintends  all,  and  connected  with 
them  is  the  millinery  departments.  Aristocratic  costumes,  equal  to  Worth's,  are  sent 
from  this  department,  and  her  dresses  for  balls  and  evening  ])arties  have  attracted 
mu'^h  attention,  so  that  her  hands  are  always  full.  Another  department  is  devoted 
to  carpets  of  every  kind  and  quality,  and  here  one  of  the  best  stocks  in  Montreal  is 
to  be  found.  The  next  is  the  glass,  china,  silver  and  tinwire  dei)arlments,  inch  '- 
ing  almost  everything  in  these  lines  that  any  one  can  wish,  with  that  of  house  furnish- 
ings in  endless  variety.  This  short  description  can  give  a  poor  idea  of  the  size  and 
importance  of  the  JJazar  Generale.  Let  those  who  have  not  been  in  it  yet  see  for 
themselves.  It  lies  on  two  h'nes  of  the  street  cars,  and  is  in  one  of  the  most  central 
parts  of  Montreal.

is  foimd^in  all  jewellers"  sho|)S  in  iJriiain.  Imiucc  and  ( leiniany .  as  well  as  oii  this 
Continent.  •'  [leinsley's  automatic  Diamond  tweezers,"  for  lifiinggems  for  ihr  piirpese 
of  examination,  has  supplied  a  want  which  forages  was  never  thought  of;  but  t  hi' thing 
which  luir,  brought  the  most  renown  to  him  has  been  his  air  tight  wiiuhiw.  of  which 
a  fine  engraving  is  given,  and  which  is  the  onlv  one  of  its  kind  on  {\\\&gt;  (Continent. 
In  I'airo[)e  window  display  is  the  leading  feature  of  the  retail  trade,  and  in  no 
business  is  this  carried  to  such  ])erfection  as  among  the  jewellers.  These  displays 
are  one  of  the  chief  attractions  to  liie  cities  of  the  old  world,  ami  any  one  wiio 
has  visited  Lontlon  or  Paris  can  testify  to  the  fact  of  the  seductive  intlumcc  that 
they  have  on  (Mie's  ])urse.  In  these  cities,  immense  values  are  put  in  the  windows, 
and  form  one  of  the  sights  for  travellers.  Keen  competition  for  generations  has 
com|iellod  retail  merchants  to  adopt  everv  i)ossible  means  to  attract  customers,  and 
without  some  such  enterprise  it  is  impossible  to  succeed.  The  general  store  has 
exerted  a.  very  gre.it  intluence  on  tlie  trade  of  this  country,  and  the  word  store  implies 
a  search  within  for  anything  you  want  :  but  in  the  old  country  way  of  doing  business 
the  merchandise  is  forced  on  ihe  notice  of  the  [uiblic,  while  here  one  has  to  search 
for  what  they  think  they  would  like,  and  a  great  deal  of  time  is  lost  in  what  is  called 
shop|jing.  One  of  the  great  hindrances  m  adoi)iiiig  the  old  country  method  of  window 
display  has  been  the  extreme  cold  in  winter  and  the  dust  aiul  flies  in  summer.  In 
winter  the  windows  freeze  and  become  opaque,  and  if  ventilated  so  that  they  could 
not  freeze,  the  dust  and  dirt  caused  by  the  \entilalion  will  spoil  the  goods.  .After 
years  of  experimenting  and  trying  to  overcome  these  difficulties,  Mr.  llemsley 
invented  a  method  by  which  these  troubles  can  be  avoided,  and  which,  if  generally 
adopted,  would  have  a  great  elTect  in  miking  the  retail  streets  more  attractive. 
The  invention  consists  in  m;iking  tlu'  window  perfectly  air-tight  and  isolating  it 
completely  I'roin  the  shop.  The  window  is  separated  from  the  shop  by  a  narrow 
passage,  so  ventilated  from  tiie  sides  and  top  that  when  the  door  is  opened  leading 
to  the  window  and  again  closed  all  the  hot  air  hom  the  shop  is  carried  away,  and 
when  the  air-tight  window  is  opened  the  air  in  the  passage  and  window  are  of  the 
same  temi)eralure.  So  perfectly  does  this  work  that  even  at  20°  below  zero  outside 
and  the  shop  at  70°,  the  window  can  be  opened  and  closed  with  impunity  without 
any  steaming  of  the  glass  ever  occurring.  The  articles  are  displayed  in  such  a  con- 
venient manner  that  goods  to  any  amount  of  value  can  be  shown,  so  that  every 
article  with  its  price  is  easily  seen,  and  the  goods  so  arranged  that  any  tray  or  article 
can  be  removed  from  the  window  and  shown  to  the  customer  with  the  greatest  of  ease. 
The  window   and   httings   were   made  by    .Messrs.  !•'.  Sage  &amp;  Co.,  Crey's  Inn  Koad,

London,  the  celebrated  shop  fitters,  who  carried  out  the  work  in  the  most  satisfactory 
manner;  and  altliough  the  window  and  fittings  were  made  there,  even  to  tlie  French 
polishing  of  the  wood  work,  some  idea  of  the  great  nicety  of  the  work  can  be  under- 
stood when  we  learn  that  it  took  three  months  to  arrange  it  in  its  position  by  work- 
men especially  sent  out  to  set  it  up.  The  lighting  is  very  effective,  having  a  row  of 
electric  lights  in  silver  lamps  suspended  outside  the  window.  It  is  secured  at  night 
by  corrugated  steel  shutters,  and  protected  from  the  sun  by  an  awning  ingeniously 
arranged  on  spring  rollers,  so  that  when  it  is  not  used  it  is  completely  invisible  to  the 
eye  of  the  passer-by.  The  interior  of  the  shop  was  also  designed  by  the  same  London 
firm,  which  with  the  large  and  complete  jewellery  factory  in  the  rear  form  one  of  the 
most  complete  and  attractive  establishments  in  Montreal.  This  attractive  window  is 
in  St.  James  street,  and  is  one  of  the  best  sights  of  tlie  street.  There  are  always  more 
or  less  passengers  stopping  and  looking  at  the  beautiful  collection  of  all  knids  of 
articles,  gold  and  silver,  whicli  one  sees  there  displayed.  What  renders  the  window 
so  attractive  is,  that  as  the  price  of  every  individual  thing  is  plainly  marked  the  public 
at  once  know  the  value  of  it.  This  European  plan  should  be  far  more  established 
here.

NOTE. 

The  Author,  ai  ihe  conclusion  of  tliis  GA/CKrn.i'.R,  l)cgs  leave  to  apologize  to  all  his 
patrons,  and  to  those  whose  memoirs  are  printed  williin  its  pages,  that,  imperfect  as 
those  memoirs  are,  they  give  only  a  slight  idea  (maybe  a  compressed  idea)  of  the 
l)rincipal  parts  of  each  individual's  life.  Time,  space  and  cost  are  important  factors 
ill  compiling  such  a  work  as  tiiis  ;  but  if  he  should,  through  ignorance  or  any  other 
cause,  have  ignored  any  families  in  Montreal  which  would  otherwise  have  appeared 
in  these  pages,  he  can  only  say  that  hundreds  (he  was  going  to  say  thousands)  of 
letters,  notes,  and  postal  cards  have  been  sent  out,  and  scores  of  calls  made  on  very 
many  families  whose  names  do  not  appear,  or  who  appear  only  in  a  shortened  sketch  ; 
that  it  is  not  the  fault  of  the  Author,  who  did  not  know  the  whole  particulars  in  such 
cases,  but  that  the  fault  is  their  own.  Perhaps,  in  the  near  future,  another  volume 
may  be  i)roduced,  dealing  with  the  balance  of  Montreal's  worthies,  and  especially  its 
Commercial  Worthies,  and  then  they  can  ajipcar  in  it.  The  original  design  of  the 
Author, — which  was  to  reproduce  all  the  pictures  in  the  same  page  with  the  letter-press 
descrijjtion, — has  been  abandoned,  and,  at  a  little  more  expense  to  both  publishers 
and  patrons,  the  likenesses  have  been  printed  and  inserted  on  thick,  separate  sheets, 
thereby  making  a  far  better  and  more  valuable  volume.  This  is  a  change  for  the 
better  which,  the  Author  feels,  not  one  of  the  interested  parties  will  object  to.  The 
original  intention  of  the  Author  was  to  publish  a  work  containing  only  the  names 
and  Biographies  of  his  actual  Patrons  and  Subscribers,  but  the  Gazkttekr  has  grown 
on  his  hands  to  such  an  extent,  that  he  has  made  it  as  complete  as  he  possibly  could, 
under  existing  circumstances,  and  he  Hatters  himself  that  the  result  is  a  work,  the 
like  of  which  has  never  before  been  published  in  Montreal,  and  containing  over 
six  hundred  sketches  of  different  persons  and  families,  who,  in  days  gone  by,  or  at 
this,  the  close  of  the  Nineteenth  Century,  have  made  Montreal  what  she  now  is, 
"  The  Metropolitical  City  of  the  Dominion  of  Canada,"  and  the  seventh  or  eighth 
largest  on  the  American  Continent. 


ADDENDA. 

Tlio  following  changes  in  the  Skotclies  of  several  of  those  represented  in  this 
Gazettickr  have  taken  place  whilst  tiie  work  was  passing  through  tlie  Press.  A 
most  important  era  in  the  History,  not  only  of  Montreal,  but  of  the  Province  of 
Quebec,  has  passed  over  the  country  since  the  commencement  of  the  printing  of  tiiese
