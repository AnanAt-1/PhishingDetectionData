<H2><A NAME="his"></A>History of Marche</H2>

<P>The County of Marche (Latin, <I>Marchia</I>) was founded in the
10 century. The first Counts of Marche were the lords of Charroux, now a village of 1,500 inhabitants, which was built near a Benedictine abbey dedicated to St. Savior. The abbey was protected
by Charlemagne and housed several councils. The owner of venerated relics, such as parts of the True Cross and samples
of the flesh and the blood of Christ, which attracted more than
25,000 visitors during the June pilgrimage, the abbey was extremely
wealthy and owned land up to England. Suppressed in 1762, the abbey
was preserved from total destruction by the writer Prosper
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, General Inspector of the Historical Monuments
during the <A HREF="fr_2emp.html">Second Empire</A>.</P>

<P>The next owners of Marche were the Counts of Lusignan, from
<A HREF="fr-poit.html">Poitou</A>, who claimed to descend from
Melusine. The most famous member of the Lusignan family, Guy of
Lusignan (1129-1194), was King of Jerusalem (1186-1192) and of
<A HREF="cy.html">Cyprus</A> (1192-1194) after having been expelled
from Jerusalem by Conrad I of Montferrat.</P>

<P>In 1308, King Philippe IV the Handsome incorporated Marche to the royal
domain. Marche was later granted to the junior branch of the house of
Bourbon as its <A HREF="fr-prov.html#apa">apanage</A>. In 1531,
following the betrayal of Constable de
<A HREF="fr-bourb.html">Bourbon</A>, all the his possessions,
including Marche, were reincorporated to the royal domain.</P>

<P>The name of the province come from the Frankish word
*<I>marka</I>, meaning "border". In the Carolingian times, a march was a
territorial district expected to protect a border. Charlemagne
created severals marches: a Danish march, which gave the name of
<A HREF="dk.html">Denmark</A>; a Saxon marche (both to protect the
north of Germany); a <A HREF="de_sorbs.html">Sorb</A> march (Elbe
region), an Avar marche (around the Danube),; a
<A HREF="it-fri.html">Friulian</A> march in Italy; a
<A HREF="fr-gasc.html">Gascon</A> march and a
<A HREF="fr-bz.html">Breton</A> march (north of
<A HREF="fr-44-na.html">Nantes</A>).<BR>
After the sharing of Charlemagne's empire, Charles the Bold, King
of <I>Francia Occidentalis</I>, maintained the march system. Some of
these marches became powerful feudal states (for instance
<A HREF="fr-flndr.html">Flanders</A> and the
<A HREF="fr-lr.html#cou">County of Toulouse</A>) when the Carolingian
rule collapsed, most probably because they were located quite far
from the central power (or at least its remains).</P>

<P>The flag of Marche is a banner of the arms <I>D'azur sem&eacute; de fleurs de lis d'or, &agrave; la cotice de gueules charg&eacute;e de trois lionceaux d'argent, brochant sur le
tout</I> (Azure semy de lis or on a bend gules three lions rampant
bendwise argent), assigned to the province by <A HREF="fr-provf.html#mod">Jacques Meurgey</A> in his <I>Notice historique sur les blasons des anciennes provinces de France</I> (Historical note on the coats of arms of the ancient French provinces, 1941).</P>

<P>These arms were used by Count Jacques around 1360. They are
similar to the arms of <A HREF="fr-bourb.html">Bourbonnais</A>, with
the three lions as the surbrisure. Jacques was the second son of
Louis I, Duke of Bourbon and founder of the third house of Bourbon.<BR>
The three lions, recalling the Lusignan family, come from the old arms of the province.</P>
