<H2> Early years </H2>
Cyr was born "Cyprien-Noé" in St. Cyprien de Napierville&nbsp;in <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("30264",this,"quebec.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("30264")' href="/topics/Quebec">Quebec</a><span class="hp" id="m30264"><div class="hpHeader">Quebec</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i30264"></div>Quebec  or   is a province in east-central Canada.

From the age of twelve Cyr worked in a lumber camp during the winters and on the family’s farm the rest of the year. He impressed his fellow workers with his feats of strength. According to one of his biographers, his mother decided “he should let his hair grow, like <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("79635",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("79635")' href="/topics/Samson">Samson</a><span class="hp" id="m79635"><div class="hpHeader">Samson</div><div class="hpContent">Samson, Shimshon ; Shamshoun  or Sampson  is the third to last of the Judges of the ancient Israelites mentioned in the Tanakh  ....</div><br></span>&nbsp;in the Bible.”  She curled it regularly.<br />
   <br />
In 1878 the Cyr family immigrated to <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("54321",this,"lowell,_massachusetts.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("54321")' href="/topics/Lowell,_Massachusetts">Lowell, Massachusetts</a><span class="hp" id="m54321"><div class="hpHeader">Lowell, Massachusetts</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i54321"></div>Lowell is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, USA.

It was in Lowell that, Cyr changed his name from Cyprien-Noé to Louis, as it was easier to pronounce in English. Again his great strength brought him fame. At seventeen he weighed 230 pounds (104 kg). He entered his first strongman contest in Boston at age eighteen, lifting a horse off the ground, the fully grown male horse was placed on a platform with 2 iron bars attached enabling Cyr to obtain a better grip. The horse weighed at least 3/4 of a ton.<br />
<H2> Rise to fame </H2>
Cyr returned to Quebec in 1882 with his family and was married. The following year he and his wife returned to Lowell, hoping to capitalize on his fame there.

He then began touring Quebec with his family in a show they called "The Troupe Cyr".<br />
From 1883 to 1885, Cyr served as a police officer in <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("78378",this,"montreal.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("78378")' href="/topics/Montreal">Montreal</a><span class="hp" id="m78378"><div class="hpHeader">Montreal</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i78378"></div>Montreal  is a city in Canada.

Following this he went on tour with a troupe that included a wrestler, a boxer and a weightlifter. He entered a strongman competition in March, 1886 at <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("27750",this,"quebec_city.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("27750")' href="/topics/Quebec_City">Quebec City</a><span class="hp" id="m27750"><div class="hpHeader">Quebec City</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i27750"></div>Quebec , also Québec, Quebec City or Québec City  is the capital of the Canadian province of Quebec and is located within the Capitale-Nationale region.

Cyr lifted a 218-pound (99 kg) barbell with one hand (to Michaud’s 158 pounds/72 kg) and a weight of 2,371 pounds (1 076 kg) on his back, to his opponent’s 2,071 pounds (940 kg) to win the title of strongest man in the country.<br />
<H2> Reputation as a strongman </H2>
While several of Cyr's feats of strength may have been exaggerated over the years, some were documented and remain impressive. These included lifting a platform on his back holding 20 men, lifting a 500 pound (227 kg) weight with his finger and pushing a freight car up an incline. He also beat <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("2436",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("2436")' href="/topics/Eugen_Sandow">Eugen Sandow</a><span class="hp" id="m2436"><div class="hpHeader">Eugen Sandow</div><div class="hpContent">Eugen Sandow , born Friedrich Wilhelm Müller, was a Prussian pioneering bodybuilder in the 19th century and is often referred to as the "Father of Modern Bodybuilding".-Early life:...</div><br></span>'s <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("77121",this,"bent_press.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("77121")' href="/topics/Bent_press">bent press</a><span class="hp" id="m77121"><div class="hpHeader">Bent press</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i77121"></div>A bent press is a type of weight training exercise wherein a weight is brought from shoulder-level to overhead one-handed using the muscles of the back, legs, and arm.

<br />
Perhaps his greatest feat occurred in 1895, when he was reported to have lifted 4,337 pounds (1,967 kg) on his back in Boston by putting 18 men on a platform and lifting them. Perhaps one of his most memorable displays of strength occurred in Montreal on October 12, 1891. Louis resisted the pull of four draught horses (two in each hand) as grooms stood cracking their whips to get the horses to pull harder.<br />
