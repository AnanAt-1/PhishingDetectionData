Additionally, the Reserved Parking areas cost $2/day from 10am-3pm on weekdays.  Like at other BART stations with paid parking, BART patrons can do parking validations and parking payments inside the BART paid area of the station.  However, since Caltrain patrons may use the same parking spaces, there are also parking payment machines outside of the BART paid area of the station.<br />
