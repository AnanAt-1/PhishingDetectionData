      <p> In the summer of 1943, the Red Army of Workers and Peasants 
        launched a massive offensive designed to drive the Nazi 
        invaders out of the Soviet Union. In Ukraine, the Dnepr 
        River presented a vital barrier. To defeat the invaders, 
        the Soviets would have to get across. Seeking a decisive 
        victory, they called on their airborne troops to break 
        this barrier and sustain the offensive. 
      <p> <em>Red Parachutes: Soviet Airborne Assault Across the 
        Dnepr</em> is based on the September 1943 operation. The 
        Soviet player is trying to get his or her army across 
        the Dnepr River by any means possible. The German player 
        must prevent this. 
      <p>As with the other games that use this game system, most 
        units are battalions with some companies and small regiments. 
        These usually belong to divisions, and they operate more 
        effectively together with units of the same division. 
      <p align="center" class="cutline"><img src="images/RPCDesant.jpg" width="246" height="377" border="1"><br>
        Crossing the Dnepr is the Soviet player&#8217;s objective. 
      <p>Units are rated for morale, attack, defense and movement. 
        Superior morale will assist a unit in several game functions 
        but particularly in combat. Tank units are rated for armor 
        quality; anti-tank units have a similar rating used to 
        fight tanks. 
      <p>Artillery is the most powerful weapon on the battlefield. 
        Artillery units may support an attack or a defense; German 
        units are somewhat more flexible than Soviet ones thanks 
        to better communications. But some of the Soviet artillery 
        has massive firepower, especially the Guards rocket units. 
        Artillery must be supplied; running out of artillery ammunition 
        is a very bad thing, and both players must choose where 
        to use their shells. 
      <p>Each game &#8220;day&#8221; is divided into three daylight 
        and one night turns. The map is divided into hexagons 
        (&#8220;hexes&#8221;) shows the area around the Bukrin 
        Bridgehead at a scale of 2 kilometers per hex.

        Loading the Red Parachutists. 
      <p>The Soviet player&#8217;s strength lies in his or her 
        rifle divisions: sixteen regular divisions, plus two more 
        of the more capable Guards rifle divisions. There are 
        also three tank corps and a cavalry corps. All of thee 
        are trying to fore their way over the river. Plus there 
        are three Guards Airborne brigades that drop behind the 
        German lines to try to assist the crossings.

      <p>The Germans have already been battered before the battle 
        opens, but have some potent formations of their own. The 
        best by far is the 7th Panzer Division, with excellent 
        morale and six tank companies (no other German division 
        brings more than four). There are four other panzer divisions, 
        one panzer grenadier division, six infantry divisions 
        and some independent units. The German side has a definite 
        edge in quality, but the German player will constantly 
        be moving his or her best units from one place to another 
        along the river line in a desperate attempt to fore back 
        the determined Soviet attackers. 
      <p><em>Red Parachutes </em>is old-fashioned wargaming at 
        its finest. Entire divisions disappear in a single turn 
        in the fierce fighting along the river line. With fearsome 
        tank battles and parachute landings, there&#8217;s also 
        exciting movement and tense decisions to be made.
