<p>From James H. Fristoe <fristoe@mindspring.com>, 13 Sep 1998, who shares an E-mail message from D. Maring <dmaring@hotmail.com>, Sep 1998.  Marin says, "Let me tell you a little of what is in Kathryn E. Jones's "Crockett Cousins",(1st ed. 1984) and an article by Robert Montgomery: "Robert Crockett made an importation oath 22 May 1740 stating that he came over from Ireland by way of Philadelphia.  His first son, John, was born July 1730 before the ship reached port.<br>The oath was taken for the purpose of getting a head-right-land grant based on bringing oneself and family to the Colony of VA.  Possibly he resided for some or all of the intervening ten years in southern Lancaster Co. Pa, near Chestnut Level, and is the Robert who is associated in court records of the 1730's along with Joseph and Samuel. (Some researchers doubt this).  He made his last will and testament 16 Nov 1746.  It was proved 19 Feb 1747 (1746 "old style" before the calendar reform)....Robert is sometimes referred to as Robert Crockett "of the Great Calfpasture, a part of present-day Rockbridge Co. taken off in 1778 from Augusta Co., VA which itself was formed from Orange Co. VA. Before he crossed from westward over North Mountain to take up land on the Calfpasture, Robert Crockett owned 322 acres in the northwest section of the Beverly Tract roughly seven miles southwest of Staunton, VA.  This tract he sold in 1743 to William McFeeters.  The Beverly Tract land could be described as lying on both sides of Middle River (formerly Catheys Creek), at the eastern foot of Little North Mountain, extending east almost to Back Creek.  Trimble's Mill on his north is easily found on a good modern map. Howard McKnight Wilson, "The Tinkling Spring: Headwater of Freedom: /A Study of the Church and The People 1732-1952 (Fisherville, VA) has a map of settlements and abstracts of the often-mentioned importation lists and some early Presbyterian records.<br>     Guardians were appointed for Robert's younger children.  John Gay was appointed guardian 20 Mar 1755 for Alexander and three brothers, but shortly after, on 221 May, 1755, John Ramsey was appointed.  In 1758, John McFeeters became Alexander's guardian."</p>
<p>"Robert Crockett of the Great Calfpasture, Augusta County, Virginia", by Robert H. Montgomery of Cambridge, Massachusetts, makes a case that this Robert has been wrongly identified by French & Armstrong (Notable Southern Families V: the Crocketts, 1928)as Robert Watkins Crockett Junior, and was probably independent of other Augusta Co. VA Crocketts.  He never used "W" or any other middle initial in VA records.  He lived quite a distance from Wythe Co. Crocketts to whom he is supposedly related".    (Note:  in my personal opinion, these arguments are not persuasive enough to dismiss other research and evidence suggesting otherwise, J. Boyer)</p>
<p>"An older and generally rejected speculation by Worth S. Ray is that Robert was the son of Robert who was the son of Richard Crockett of VA and MD.  This is contradicted by the importation oath and not supported by any evidence at all. It also makes Robert a liar."</p>
<p>"Montgomery believed that Robert "must be taken as an Irish immigrant of unknown ancestry".  His arguments are persuasive, but he did not know of some Lancaster Co. PA court records which suggest that Robert was related to the other Crocketts who settled much further south in VA (modern Wythe Co.)  I accepted Montgomery's line of reasoning until I came across records showing a Robert, Joseph, and Samuel, and the Montgomerys and other familiar names, all associated in Lancaster Co. PA in the early 1730s.  Others think I am mistaken.<br> I don't believe the case is closed".   Don Maring, Sept. 1998</p>
<p>From "Carlile And Related Families, Augusta, Bath and Highland Counties Virginia 1745 to 1875" by Carol Watson and Frances Buchanan Arlington, 1994. "...Robert Crockett, an original settler on the Calfpasture River near present-day Goshen, VA.  Robert Crockett died before 20 Mar 1755 when the Augusta County VA court recorded "John Gay's bond as guardian (appt) to Samuel, James, Alexander and Andrew Crockett, orphans of Robert Crockett, deceased, with sureties John Ramsey, James Boreland" (Chalkey, III, pg 38)"</p>
