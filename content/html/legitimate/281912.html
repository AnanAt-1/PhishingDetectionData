	 <H1>Monitoring the weather with RISC OS </H1> 
	 <P>If, like me, you think it's fun to keep tabs on the weather, you might
		be pleased to discover the budget weather station kit sold by a firm in the
		USA. <A HREF="http://www.dalsemi.com/"><STRONG>Dallas
		Semiconductor</STRONG></A> <A HREF="#webliography">[1]</A>, of Texas, are well
		known as manufacturers of integrated circuits. One of their devices may be
		found in some Acorn models. Lift the lid on a Risc-PC for example, and towards
		the front from the processor slots you can locate a socketed 3-pin device that
		looks like a transistor. This is a DS2401 silicon serial number, that holds a
		unique 64-bit code, laser-engraved at the factory. This was chosen by Acorn to
		give a unique machine ID. </P> 
	 <P>What's clever about this line of chips is the 1-wire bus that connects
		them to the rest of the system. This is a bi-directional serial data line, that
		allows communication between the host and many Dallas chips without the need
		for a clock line. &#145;1-wire&#146; is a bit of a fib of course, as for any
		current to flow there has to be an &#145;earth&#146; connexion as well. But
		even a power line is optional, as an internal capacitance gets charged up off
		the serial line, providing the required drive voltage.</P> 
	 <P>Dallas now have a broad line of <A HREF="http://www.ibutton.com/">1-wire
		devices</A> <A HREF="#webliography"> [2]</A>, including switches, counters and
		analogue-to-digital converters. They even do a Java-based computer in a tiny
		stainless-steel canister (called an &#145;iButton&#146;), like a calculator
		battery, that holds secret keys and has its own encryption engine for tasks
		such as e-mail encoding or as an alternative to stamps in the US postal system.
		</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="fig1"></A><A HREF="jpegs/fig1.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="jpegs/thumbs/fig1.jpg" ALT="1-wire WX station" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0"></A></P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 1. The 1-wire weather station </I></P> 
	 <P>The weather station kit is a bit of a departure from their normal range,
		mainly intended as a promotional item I think, rather than as a serious
		contender to the professional systems that cost a great deal more. You can buy
		it on-line at the <A HREF="http://www.ibutton.com/weather/">iButton web
		site</A> <A HREF="#webliography">[3]</A> for $79. They will add a charge for
		delivery (mine came by Federal Express) and HM Customs &amp; Excise will want
		to charge you too (usually via the couriers). </P> 
	 <P>As kits go this one doesn&#146;t take much putting together. The main
		body of the weather station is a plastic moulding, split down the middle. The
		anemometer, with its three cups, projects from the top, and the wind vane from
		beneath &#150; see <A HREF="#fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</A>. In the middle is a circular
		printed circuit board (PCB), on which are all the 1-wire chips &#150; see
		<A HREF="#fig2">Fig.&nbsp;2</A>. The 1-wire bus is connected through US-style
		(RJ11) telephone sockets, which are a smaller version of 10baseT ethernet
		sockets (RJ45). This is a little unfortunate for us (outside America) as the
		tools to make up cables are more expensive than those for our domestic
		telephone connectors; around &pound;15 from <A HREF="http://www.farnell.com/">Farnell</A> <A HREF="#webliography">[4]</A> is
		the cheapest I've found. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="fig2"></A><A HREF="jpegs/fig2.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="jpegs/thumbs/fig2.jpg" ALT="WX station PCB" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0"></A> </P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 2. Weather station PCB and wind vane shaft.</I></P> 
	 <H2>How it works </H2> 
	 <P>The main components on the weather station PCB are: </P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>DS1820 thermometer</LI> 
		<LI>DS2401 silicon serial number, &times; 8 </LI> 
		<LI>DS2423 counter </LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>To measure the temperature the computer instructs the DS1820 to start
		its temperature conversion cycle. Around one second later it will have the
		result. To measure wind speed the anemometer cups rotate a shaft, with two
		magnets mounted just above the PCB. These pass over a reed switch &#150; a
		small glass capsule containing a pair of contacts that close when near to a
		magnet. Each time either magnet passes, the switch pulses the DS2423 counter
		&#150; twice per rotation. By reading the count every few seconds the rate of
		shaft rotation, and consequently the wind speed, is determined. </P> 
	 <P>The wind vane is a little more troublesome &#150; but clever! In this
		case the shaft from the vane has a single magnet, that rides just below eight
		reed switches. Each reed switch connects a DS2401 silicon serial number (as
		used by Acorn) to the bus. The program scans the bus to see which chips are
		present, showing which of the reed switches are closed. If the magnet is about
		midway between two switches both will close, so in all sixteen compass points
		can be read. </P> 
	 <P>The instructions for assembling the weather station are on the iButton
		site. You will need to drill holes through the 1-inch aluminium tube for a
		suitable U-bolt, to mount it to a mast. If the PCB is not already coated, you
		should apply a waterproof PCB varnish or lacquer. Silicone rubber sealant must
		be applied to the join in the weather station body, and around the tube entry,
		to keep out the rain. </P> 
	 <P>A bus interface to connect to your computer&#146;s RS232 port is
		supplied with the weather station. This has a 9-pin D connector, and plugs
		straight into later RISC OS models. Pre-A5000 machines will require a short
		lead between the interface and the computer, with pins 2, 4 and 8 joined at the
		computer end. </P> 
	 <H2>Installation </H2> 
	 <P>To get a representative measure of wind speed and direction the weather
		station needs to be mounted well away from obstructions. Ideally it should be
		on a mast away from buildings, but a mast on the house should be a reasonable
		compromise, so long as you get it as high as possible, and above the roof line.
		</P> 
	 <P>Good quality cable should be used, especially for longer runs.
		Ethernet-style category 5 &#145;twisted-pair&#146; cable is ideal, but
		telephone cable will often suffice. Be sure to secure the cable to your mast /
		walls with suitable ties and cleats, or it will make a lot of noise and even
		come off in a strong wind. If you have to go through a wall or window frame
		make a downwards loop in the cable, so that the approach to the hole is from
		below, to keep drips away. Use some silicone sealant around the hole. </P> 
	 <H2>Software </H2> 
	 <P>The main program supplied by Dallas, at the iButton site, is for MS
		Windows (95 or later). There is also a Java version and simple example programs
		in C for Linux, Mac, &amp;c. My contribution is it take this C code, change the
		serial port code to talk to the block drivers, and bolt on a graphical
		interface, resembling the Windows application. The resulting program,
		<I>!Oww</I> (one-wire weather), can be found on the
		<A HREF="../download.html#oww">downloads</A> page. </P> 
	 <P>Before you run the program be sure to have the latest version of the
		block driver program, <I>!SerialDev</I>. Early versions may lead to a crash.
		Basic version-12 drivers are included in the application directory in case
		<I>!SerialDev</I> is absent. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="fig3"></A>
		<IMG SRC="jpegs/fig3.jpg" ALT="!Oww" WIDTH="476" HEIGHT="415" BORDER="0" LOWSRC="jpegs/lowthumbs/fig3.jpg"></P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 3. !Oww main window </I></P> 
	 <P><I>Oww</I> has three windows. The main display window is shown in
		<A HREF="#fig3">Fig.&nbsp;3</A>. This is where the values read from the weather
		station are presented. The wind direction has a graphical display as a compass
		rose. Above this is the wind speed. Temperature is shown numerically and by a
		small &#145;virtual&#146; bulb. For a more dramatic display you may set the
		weather station graphic to animate! </P> 
	 <P>But you won&#146;t get any results here until you've done some setting
		up. There are two further windows (available from the<I>Oww</I> menu):
		&#145;Setup&#146; and &#145;Devices&#146;. These are shown in <A HREF="#fig4">Figs. 4</A> and <A HREF="#fig5">5</A>. I will leave the fine
		detail of the setup window to the <TT>!Help</TT> file, but the important item
		to consider now is the serial port setup, in the &#145;Block driver&#146;
		section.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="fig4"></A><IMG SRC="pngs/fig4.png" ALT="Setup" WIDTH="448" HEIGHT="307" BORDER="0"> </P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 4. Setup window </I></P> 
	 <P>With the standard built-in serial port, <I>Oww</I> can use the
		&#145;<TT>InternalPC</TT>&#146; driver. Older machines machines (pre-A5000) are
		not likely to work, because of the lower voltages provided on the serial port.
		The numeric entry only comes into play if your serial device has multiple
		ports. </P> 
	 <P>Already <I>Oww</I> will have complained about a missing
		&#145;devices&#146; file. This is because all 1-wire device numbers are unique,
		and I can't anticipate the IDs of the chips in your weather station. So you
		will have to access the &#145;Devices&#146; dialogue. Now click
		&#145;Search&#146; in the &#145;devices&#146; window. If all is well the
		program will determine the IDs of your weather station chips, and the main
		window will correctly display temperature and wind speed &#150; see
		<A HREF="#fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</A>. If not, check that the serial port
		configuration is correct, and that everything is properly connected.</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="fig5"></A><IMG SRC="pngs/fig5.png" ALT="Devices" WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="307" BORDER="0"> </P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 5. !Oww devices setup </I></P> 
	 <P>At this stage <I>Oww</I> will not know the IDs of all the wind vane
		switches. Begin &#145;teaching&#146; with the wind vane pointing north &#150;
		conventionally pointing away from the 1-inch tube, but it depends on how you
		finally mount the instrument. Press &#145;Search&#146;. The wind vane section
		of the devices window should read &#145;Vane &#150; Found &#150; 1&#146;,
		indicating that one switch ID has been determined. If the number is
		&#145;2&#146; you should move the vane slightly and start again, as starting
		with the magnet over two switches might get them in the wrong order. Now rotate
		the vane slowly in a clockwise direction (setting the update time to
		&#145;1&#146;&#150; see the &#145;Setup&#146; window). The number should
		increment, and the vane displayed in the main window will also rotate. When you
		reach &#145;8&#146; the procedure is complete, and you can click the
		&#145;Save&#146; button. But do another full rotation to check that everything
		is in order. If after installation the wind vane direction is misaligned you
		can adjust the &#145;Offset&#146; entry by &plusmn;8 compass points. You will
		have noticed that the procedure requires access to the weather station, so you
		must do this before permanent installation! It would probably be a good idea to
		make a safe back up of the &#145;<TT>devices</TT>&#146; file inside the
		<I>!Oww</I> application directory, or at least lock it.</P> 
	 <P>Once all is correctly set up the display window should produce sensible
		readings, such as in <A HREF="#fig3">Fig.&nbsp;3</A>. After being mesmerized
		for a bit by the wind vane display twirling about, you could check the results
		in a log file. </P> 
	 <H2>Keeping a log </H2> 
	 <P><I>Oww</I> can record your weather measurements to comma-separated-value
		(CSV) log files, which you can later use in spreadsheets, for example.
		<A HREF="#fig6">Fig.&nbsp;6</A> shows the wind speed (raspberry) and ambient
		temperature (dark blue) on a day in early December. You can log data to a
		single file or to a fresh file each day. In this mode <I>!Oww</I> will create a
		directory for the current month, into which it will write a file for the
		current day, changing to a new one at midnight. </P> 
	 <P> <A NAME="fig6"></A><IMG SRC="pngs/fig6.png" ALT="WX plot" WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="295" BORDER="0"></P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 6. Some weather &#150; wind speed and temperature </I></P> 
	 <H2>Passing it on</H2> 
	 <P>If you want to read live data into another program you may simply access
		the <TT>Oww$Logged</TT> system variable. This always holds the most recently
		recorded weather values, in the same format as a log line. Here is an example:
		</P> 
	 <P><TT>04/12/99 , 16:03:33 , 1.1,&deg;C , 8.34, MPH, East , 90.0 , 4 , 8.1,
		mm </TT></P> 
	 <P>Applications may also pick up values broadcast in <I>ThermIIC</I>-style
		broadcast messages. So my <I><A HREF="../thermiic/thermon.html">TherMon</A></I>
		application <A HREF="#webliography">[5]</A> can be used to plot the weather in
		real time. See <A HREF="#fig7">Fig.&nbsp;7</A> for an example screen grab. This
		also means that simple <I>cgi</I> programs can be used if your computer is
		running a web server, providing real-time weather data on a web page. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="fig7"></A><IMG SRC="pngs/fig7.png" ALT="TherMon" WIDTH="372" HEIGHT="273" BORDER="0"> </P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 7. TherMon screen grab </I></P> 
	 <H2>Rain gauge </H2> 
	 <P>You may have spotted some icons in the windows referring to a rain
		gauge. This is an optional extra from Dallas, for $49. As you can see from
		<A HREF="#fig8">Fig.&nbsp;8</A> it is another two-part plastic moulding. The
		top of the unit acts as a funnel to collect precipitation (yes, snow or hail
		works too, once it melts!).</P> 
	 <P><A NAME="fig8"></A> <A HREF="jpegs/fig8a.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="jpegs/thumbs/fig8a.jpg" ALT="rain gauge" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0"></A>&nbsp;<A HREF="jpegs/fig8b.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="jpegs/thumbs/fig8b.jpg" ALT="rain gauge" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="200" BORDER="0"></A></P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 8. The rain gauge kit </I></P> 
	 <P>Inside sits a tipping bucket &#150; see close-up, <A HREF="#fig9">Fig.&nbsp;9</A>. This pivots at the bottom, so that one side tips
		down, and the other side tips up to collect water from under the funnel. When
		this fills it becomes unbalanced, and eventually tips over. This side then
		empties, and the other side starts filling, so that the process repeats as long
		as it keeps raining. The bucket carries a small magnet, which sweeps past an
		interface PCB on each tip. The PCB contains another reed switch, connected to a
		counter. Reading this counter determines the number of tips &#150; each
		corresponds to 0.01&quot; of rainfall. </P> 
	 <P><A NAME="fig9"></A><A HREF="jpegs/fig9.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="jpegs/thumbs/fig9.jpg" ALT="Tipping bucket" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0"></A> </P> 
	 <P><I>Figure 9. Tipping bucket and 1-wire counter </I></P> 
	 <P>Assembly of the kit is even simpler than for the main weather station.
		For one thing we don&#146;t have to keep water out! The PCB is encapsulated in
		black rubber. The tipping assembly is pushed together and bolted into position.
		You'll need some more cable and an RJ11 plug to connect link the bus to the
		second socket in the weather station. At the rain gauge this must be connected
		to the two wires protruding from the PCB. The recommended means for this is
		called a &#145;Skotchlok&#146;. These snap down onto the wires and squidge
		waterproof grease around the join. If you solder to the wires instead, be sure
		to provide your own waterproofing. To attach the gauge to a pole requires two
		&#145;Jubilee&#146; clips. </P> 
	 <P>To get an accurate 0.01&quot; per tip you must adjust two screws that set the
		travel of the bucket. This takes a while, as you must let 1 US pint (i.e. 473.2
		ml, or 16 US fluid ounces &#150; a little over 16 imperial fluid ounces, and a
		lot less than a &#145;real&#146; pint) dribble through in an hour. This
		corresponds to 1&quot; of rainfall, and so should produce 100 tips. If the water
		runs through too quickly some will get lost during each tip, and the gauge will
		under-read. This is a known short-coming of tipping-bucket gauges. </P> 
	 <P>Even if your system does not run for 24 hours a day the rain gauge
		should still accumulate the correct total precipitation. When the bus is
		powered-down the counter runs off a small battery on the PCB. </P> 
	 <H2>&#145;Devices&#146; revisited </H2> 
	 <P>As for the main instrument <I>Oww</I> needs to determine the serial
		number of the 1-wire counter in the rain gauge. So open the &#145;Devices&#146;
		window and start the search process. Now the rain entry should also read
		&#145;Found&#146;. However, you must make sure <I>Oww</I> has not confused rain
		and wind &#150; twirl the anemometer and tip the bucket. Click the swap button
		to swap them, if necessary. </P> 
	 <P>With everything set up and the instrument installed, all you need is
		some rain. My colleagues thought me quite peculiar (more than usual) fervently
		hoping for rain. Once it comes you should find the reading on the main window
		incrementing in 0.01&quot; (or 0.25-mm) steps. After some days of heavy rain the
		reading might be so big that you prefer to start again from zero. On the setup
		window there is a button to reset the reading. </P> 
	 <H2>Final words </H2> 
	 <P>That covers wind, temperature and rain measurements, telling you most
		you might want to know about the current weather. Dallas are now talking about
		a pressure add-on, which would provide some more predictive information. All
		we&#146;d need then is a &#145;virtual&#146; Michael Fish! </P> 
	 <H2>Lightning </H2> 
	 <P>If your area suffers from a lot of lightning you should take extra
		precautions when mounting electronic equipment high up. The weather station has
		some built-in protection (an electro-static discharge protection diode) but
		this might not be enough to guard against a really close strike. Useful advise,
		about lightning conductors and other schemes, was posted on the weather station
		<A HREF="http://www.ibutton.com/weather/#forum">discussion group</A>
		<A HREF="#webliography">[6]</A>, and this is now available from the
