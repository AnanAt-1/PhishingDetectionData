<H3> The early years (1924-33) </H3>
Arkansas had a relatively late start in basketball; it didn't field its first team in the sport until 1924.  <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("40083",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("40083")' href="/topics/Francis_Schmidt">Francis Schmidt</a><span class="hp" id="m40083"><div class="hpHeader">Francis Schmidt</div><div class="hpContent">Francis Albert Schmidt  was an American football player and coach of football, basketball, and baseball.

During this time, Arkansas finished first in the Southwest Conference&nbsp;four out of six years, and compiled an overall record of 113-17, which, at .869, is the highest  winning percentage of any Arkansas coach ever.<br />
<br />
In the 1930 season, Charles Bassett&nbsp;took over as head coach. He would coach until the 1933 season. Arkansas finished first in the Southwest Conference during his first year, but would not finish above third place for the rest of his reign. After 4 seasons, his overall record was 62-29.<br />
<H3>First Glen Rose era (1934-42)</H3>

Lambert's final record was 113-22.<br />
<br />
Presley Askew would take over in 1950 and would only last until 1952. Arkansas would tie for first place in the Southwest conference in his first season, but would get progressively worse. The Razorbacks would not make the NCAA tournament during this tenure. His combined record was 35-37.<br />
<H3>Second Glen Rose era (1953-66)</H3>
Glen Rose would take back over on 1953 and would last until 1966.

Rose's overall record for his time at Arkansas was 325-204.<br />
<H3> Waller and Van Eman years (1967-74) </H3>
Duddy Waller&nbsp;would become head coach for the 1966-67 season, but only lasted until the 1970-71 season. His overall record during his 4 seasons was 31-64, which was the worst overall winning percentage, at 0.326, of any Arkansas basketball coach. Waller was replaced by Lanny Van Eman, who lasted from the 1970-71 season through the 1973-74 season. Van Eman finished his career at Arkansas with a 48-56 record. Arkansas failed to finish above second place under during the tenure of these 2 coaches, and would not receive any invitations to the NCAA tournament.<br />
