MGGHAT Version 1.1

<DD>
MGGHAT (MultiGrid Galerkin Hierarchical Adaptive Triangles) is a
FORTRAN program for the solution of general second order linear
self-adjoint elliptic partial differential equations with
Dirichlet, natural or mixed boundary conditions on 2D polygonal
domains (possibly with holes).
<P>
MGGHAT uses a finite element method with linear, quadratic or
cubic elements (user selectable) over triangles.  The adaptive
refinement via newest vertex bisection and the multigrid iteration
are both based on a hierarchical basis formulation.  Run time and
a posteriori graphical displays are made with gnuplot.
<P>
Several changes have been made since version 1.0.  It now has
the capability to save the program state and evaluate the solution
from the saved state.  This is useful for systems of equations,
time dependent problems, nonlinear equations, etc.  Examples for
a system of equation and a time dependent problem are included.
All graphics are now done with gnuplot.  A Tcl/Tk based menu has
been added for manipulation of the graphics.

<P>  An <A HREF="user.f.poisson"> example driver program </A> for solving
     Poisson's equation with mixed boundary conditions is available.  You can
     also view the <A HREF="poisson.output"> printed output </A> from
     running this example, and a <A HREF="screendump.gif"> screendump </A>
     showing an example of the graphics.

<P>  You can learn more about the methods used in MGGHAT by reading
     <A HREF="/~WMitchell/papers/thesis.pdf"> ``Unified
     multilevel adaptive finite element methods for elliptic problems''</A>
     (pdf, 260K).

<P>  The MGGHAT software is available as a <A HREF="mgghat1.1.tar.gz">
     single gzipped tar file</A> (300K),
     or as <A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/pdes/mgghat">
