Although possessing a heavier build the weight is muscle and he is very agile and light on his feet. He wears his blonde hair in a 80/20 part split with a practical undercut<br /><br />Distinguishing Features: Erwin has a very striking face with a strong masculine jawline and prominent cheekbones. His eyebrows are however his most obvious facial feature due to their large size an peculiar shape. <br /></div></div><br /><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br />Personality: When people look at Erwin they may say he is a man who is very much ruled by his head and not his heart. However the true thoughts of the Commander are a lot more complex. Erwin Smith is a man that will listen to all feedback that is given to him, be it positive or negative or downright abusive with a very serious but stoic demeanor. He will accept the outcomes of his actions and is strong in the face of grim situations. He stands strong in the face of adversity by having full confidence in himself and having a clear image of what he wants to achieve. His composed nature can come off as cold and ruthless but he is not void of emotion and he does not wish for an unnecessary amount of people to die. He is fully aware that he is not infallible but he is a man whose determination and courage will lead him to never give up until the day his heart can no longer physically beat for humanity. <br /><br />Erwin does have the ability to send men to their deaths if it is for the greater good of humanity, a trait that is needed in his line of work even if it comes off as cold blooded to those who are not yet familiar with the true face of war and death. While he trusts his men to do their duty he knows that all people have the ability to make mistakes and there are only a few who he trusts completely. Past experiences will heavily influences his choices which could be considered merciless to those looking in at his decisions. The Commander however is not all talk and will actively follow through with his own words believing in what he does with all his heart and will give up everything including his humanity and happiness for the sake of the survival of mankind. <br /><br />Over the years it seems that his will to save humanity has led him to give up almost everything on a personal level. Behind his stoic mask you may however catch a glimpse of the human he once was and you will see a very fatherly man whose goal always has been and will be to unite humanity under the banner of freedom. He can be quite friendly in a personal setting and is especially colloquial with those he considers equals such as Hange, Mike and Levi.<br /><br />Erwin is a very honest man in the regard that he will never tell a lie he will however very often choose not to comment on a situation. He believes that a person should be fully educated on what they are fighting for and will not fill new cadets heads with false ideas of glory for all that join the recon corps and feels comfort from knowing that all that offer their hearts to humanity do so under their own free will. <br /><br />Calculative and far thinking he is a man that will never say something without thinking of its consequence. Sometimes what he says and does not make sense or can seem confusing but rest assure that it always does have something to do with the situation or possible future scenarios. <br /><br /></div></div><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br />History: ((Will be added to and altered as the canon is revealed ))<br /><br />Erwin was born within the walls of Sina during the years of peace and for his young life he was unaware that anyone suffered. He spent his time oblivious to such things and was much more focused on challenging his mind with puzzles, books or other things he was curious about solving.  Erwins uncle often traveled between the walls and when Erwin was old enough he requested to travel with him on one of his adventures even if that adventure was just business. However Erwin was surprised to see that not everyone enjoyed the life that he did and that got his mind thinking more and more. Having an advanced mind for a boy of his age it was forgivable for those around him to not think that he would understand things sooner or later and and that he would start to question things like corruption. As he aged he saw that those who he considered family, friends and neighbours seems to only care about sustaining their wealth and power within humanities center of existence. Peace had been as it is for decades but nothing had changed, were they really as great as they said if they were just the kings of their cages? He felt suddenly insignificant and in a way he was. He was set up to live a privileged and uneventful life where he lived in a happy bubble of ignorance while looking down at those who were not lucky enough to be born into a better situation and Erwin wanted more than that. <br /><br />Despite protest from his family he decided to join the military who only finally agreed after convincing them that his goal was to join the Military police. The training was hard work as he had only ever had training with horse riding when it came to physical exercise. Erwin had to work twice as hard to help catch up physically with the other cadets and after a growth spurt he became a decent enough solider to be ranked in within the top 10 of his graduating year alongside the likes of Hange Zoe, Mike Zakarius, Moses Brown and Nile Dawk. This achievement however was due to a lot of hard work and perfect scores in theory to make up for his shortcomings.<br /><br />Even from a young age he was quite set on joining the Survey Corps and worked very diligently at improving his abilities. With the ability to think very quickly on the spot when given a task his skills as a strategist and leader rapidly improved and became his obvious strength. <br /><br />Besides the plans to try and extend human territories, there was little else to do for the Survey Corps to do so his time was spent within the inner walls anyway, assisting the Military police in Criminal control. However Erwin always took this rather seriously and made a few enemies within the MP as well as solidifying an ever growing grudge between himself and Nile Dawk. At this point in his mind Erwin still carried part of his youthful but reserved enthusiasm and hope. He smiled more often and he had more trust in others as well as having a much more personal point to prove about changing the way things are run in the Military.<br /><br />As he gained more experience and had his first mission outside of the walls he did start to realize that there was more to changing the world than just being strong for others. He was soon counted on for his strategy and leadership skills and it was apparent that he was a born leader and by his mid twenties he had become a squad leader of his own squad. However he was required to choose his own squad which proved very difficult. Mike and Hange were two very obvious choices, he felt as if he could trust those two and both had very obvious strengths. Mike who was the best in his class in battle and Hange who could level out his more practical intellect with her ability to think outside the box. Erwins choices for the remaining members of his squad came from a very unexpected place, three thugs who had commandeered some black market maneuver gear and who had finally run out of luck selling one too many lots of Opium. <br /><br />Since seeing Levi use his gear he had his mind set on seeing Levi on his squad and knew he had a well of untapped potential even if that meant arguing for Levis freedom for a year after the thug was arrested. In the end Erwin became personally responsible for Levi and making sure that he behaved. <br /><br />Levi didn't join with the others, like Hange and Mike and came in and viewed the military with fresh eyes. Sometimes it takes an outsider to notice the changes and issues a person is experiencing and Erwin had not realized how far he had gone until he had a slap of reality given to him. Having a close friendship to Levi gives him reassurance that he is still human and also lets him share in that "outsider" view and not feel so institutionalized. Erwin is also aware that Levi is a beacon of hope for humanity, people view him as humanities strongest and their greatest. <br /><br />When Erwin was promoted to Commander those who remanded alive were all given promotions as well, along with their own squads. Despite his now highly ranked position he earned that completely on his own worth and not that of connections.  Even now that he is in his early thirties Erwin has yet to settle down with anyone or get married. In fact any thoughts or possibilities were given away the day he decided to accept the position of Commander. Right now he believes he could not devote what is needed to a spouse or family and chose to not seek that path in life.<br /></div></div><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br /><br />Likes: <br />Strategy games or any activity that gets him thinking: Erwin has a sharp mind and has a fondness of strategy games like chess and Poker. He also enjoys reading and doing research. <br /><br />Horse riding: Although there is little time now for him to enjoy horse riding on a recreational basis Erwin is very comfortable in the saddle. He is quite good at controlling a horse and doing trick riding. <br /><br />Drawing: Erwin is surprising good with his hands when it comes to the art of map and guide creation. He finds the creation of formation plans surprisingly enjoyable and has come up with many new and innovative strategies. He can also draw diagrams in a realistic fashion, again he no longer has the time to do this often on a recreational basis. <br /><br />Spicy food: The commander has a fondness for spicy cuisine, especially if it is spiced with red chillis. Back in his cadet years he was notorious in always making food extraordinarily spicy when it was his turn to help cook. The one luxury item that he will sometimes indulge in is dark chocolate favoured with chilli. <br /><br />Puns and play on words: To anyone that knows Erwin this would not come as a surprise. He secretly finds such jokes hilarious and will sometimes slip them into his own speech patterns while keeping a straight face which may leave you wondering if he did it on purpose.<br /><br />Blue is his favourite colour, his lucky number is 13 and he finds the smell of Lavender relaxing. <br /><br />Dislikes: <br />Ignorance: He finds blatant ignorance and stubborn idiocy very irritating. Erwin does try to combat this issue by being very honest, open and understanding of people, especially when he firsts meet them in hopes of setting a good base for a pleasant rapport between them, this however is not possible with all people and in all situations.<br /><br />Corruption: Erwin understands that not everyone has the fortitude and ability to face Titans in battle and harbours no resentment to those who choose not to fight. However those who actively exploit the system are people that lose respect in the eyes of the commander. If you are a hindrance to humanity than chances are you are heading to be disliked by Erwin.<br /><br />Laziness: Erwin recognizes that not everyone can reach greatness, in fact he states this honestly when he speaks. But he does believe one should do all they can to better themselves, to the best of their abilities.<br /><br />Abuse of power or potential: There is one thing that he dislikes more than people being lazy and that is those who make a decent effort to then only use to for negative means. Those who actively work hard just to join the military police come to mind as well as those who use their brilliant minds for selfish reasons. <br /><br /><br />Strengths: <br />Well spoken: Erwin has an eloquent way of speaking and can convey his ideas and arguments well which results in him successful persuading people to follow and trust him. He has the ability to deliver a stirring speech while keeping a very calm demeanor which gives him an aura of confidence and honesty that garner him respect. <br /><br />Collectedness: In the face of an adverse situation Erwin has the ability to remain composed and think rationally. This strength helps him remain calm even in the face of death or failure. <br /><br />Conviction: Erwin is not a man to say meaningless words in an eloquent manner. He believes in what he is fighting for with complete conviction and his words and actions ring true. <br /><br />Master of strategy and general intelligence: Erwin has a very gifted mind and has the ability to think in an unbiased and creative manner. He has the ability to assess people and the situation and think out many different motives and possibilities that could be accurate. <br /><br />Patience: Erwin has the ability to look at a plan long term strategy and wait for the right moment to implement his actions. <br /><br /><br />Weaknesses: <br />Stone cold alienation: After certain events in his life, Erwin has come to wear an emotional mask. He even finds it difficult to take this down in front of those he has known a long time and often will end up distancing himself from those who care about him or humanity in general. This is a Strength in some cases such as the battle field but on a personal level there is often a wall between him and his emotional opinion. He has a mindset that he has a limited future, will never live a normal life and has given up thoughts on marriage or family, to him the military is his family. He is very aware that his own humanity is a low on the priority list. In a nut shell he has difficultly turning 'commander mode' off. <br /><br />Lack of empathy: A symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Erwin has little empathy for trivial everyday issues. He feels detached from others and emotionally numb at times. These are common symptoms with PTSD and the fact that he seems distant and closed off can cause many others to find him impossible to get close to and a few people who knew him before hand have taken his attitude change personally. He is still kind to newcomers he just can't open up to them. He simply has never had the time to sort out these issues. Erwins PTSD symptoms are mostly of the Avoidance and numbing variety. Due to all this he does have issues dealing with whining and 'high school' problems. <br /><br />His remaining personal agenda: As much as Erwin tries to keep an unbiased outward view on everything there are still some very big exceptions to his usual mindset. He believes that everyone was born equal but some humans are more equal than others and the fact that he honestly believes that unsettles him. He wants humanity to survive but also believes that some are more important to the world and need to live on. On that note as much of a power duo he and Levi make, Levi friendship is a weakness for Erwin. This being the case he always views Levis existence as very important and will put his live over the worth of many others. <br /><br />He is inwardly high strung: Erwin often runs the risk of burning himself out. He will often stay awake late into the night and forgets to sleep. He has an issue of setting himself personal limitations and often forgets that he still has a human body to look after while trying to get all his work done. He often needs someone to tell him to go sleep.<br /><br />Fears: <br />Failure: Erwin fears that he will fail in his goal to save humanity. It is a big ask of himself with a very high chance of happening and he is trying to create realistic fall backs for if he was to die. <br /><br />Humanity losing their faith in him: Erwin fears that he may go too far one day due to his method of throwing away his humanity to get results. He fears his alienation will cause him to be viewed as a monster by everyone and for them to cast him aside. The support and trust of those he considers his inner circle keep him feeling human. <br /><br />Losing those he cares for: Erwin is actually quite naturally a people person and honestly does enjoy the company of others. However he has created a select inner circle of friends who managed to make their way into his heart before he walled it off. This fear ties in with one of his weaknesses. He fears he will lose them. He fears that they will be gone and he will be unable to let anyone new into his life. He fears that this is when he will slip into losing his humanity completely. <br /><br />Quirks:<br />Erwin has an odd sense of humour that could be best described as 'dad humour'. He will often make puns and play on words when describing things although these will be done almost always completely straight faced so often they fly completely over peoples heads.<br /><br />Erwin has been noted to have no noticeable scent even by those with very sensitive noses. He will brush it off if you asked about it but that does not mean there is necessarily an underlying reason for lack of distinct smell. It could just be him quietly finding it amusing that it bothers a few people that he does not seem to acquire that unfortunate odour most soldiers get after a day of training.<br /><br /><br />Skillset: <br />Physical Strength: 9<br />Intelligence: 10<br />Teamwork: 7<br />Confidence: 10<br />Agility: 10 </div></div><br /><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br />Roleplay Sample: (this is also a little history for Erwin! )<br />~~Before the fall of Wall Maria~~<br /><br />Captain Erwins head hung as low as his current state of moral as the line of horses made it's way through the streets of the Shiganshina District. His eyebrows creased slightly and he felt a weird prickling sensation creep up the back of his neck. His mind was unable to shake away the thoughts of choices he could of changed to have assured a better outcome. His eyes flicked up for a moment as the drone of the crowd became louder and his mind finally focused on the curious mass of humans that had gathered to watch them return. As he glanced up, his eyes make contact with a young brown haired boy who was smiling at him with awed expression. Erwins eyes widened in for for a split second at the surprise that someone could still look at him like that. Right now he did not feel like he deserved that sort of admiring look and he quickly looked away as the feeling of shame threatened to engulf him. <br /><br />The recon corp has suffered one of the most overwhelming losses that Captain Erwin Smith had ever seen in his time in Military. Moral was appalling low within Legion and he could feel the sense of hopelessness lingered in everyones minds and left many feeling sick including Erwin himself. However, as horrific as the expedition had been it was not the feeling of loss that was bringing the taste of bile to his mouth, it had been the return home and the actions of his Commander. Erwin remained quiet during the whole ordeal, unable to look at the man as he dropped to his knees to tell Moses' mother that it had all been for nothing, the 12th Commander unable to cope with the guilt when faced yet again with grieving families and a jeering crowd. Moses Brown had not died believing he was giving his life for nothing and he felt as his Commanders actions were an insult to all those who had died. <br /><br />Erwin felt numb as they were finally able to leave the scene and the sound of hooves connecting with cobblestone drowned out the crowd as the remains of his companions made their way back towards the inner walls. As Erwin got a view of the commanders face he knew that the man would not last much longer in the position, the mans spirit was utterly shattered. However it was unlikely he would keep his job either way, he was quite sure that he would be demoted for his recent actions. But who would be the one they chose to take on the role as the next commander if that happened? This mission had seen the deaths of those who would have been considered decent candidates including Moses Brown who had rode beside the 12th Commander until his untimely death. <br /><br />When Erwin had joined the Recon Corps he had been wanting to change things, he wanted to make a difference and as embarrassed as he was now to admit it he wanted to save humanity. After joining the recon Erwin had quickly discovered that those who were not up to the task were quickly weeded out. He never thought that it was possible to have a worse experience than the feeling he had on his first mission but this expedition had been nightmarish. He knew now however there was so much that needed to be sacrificed before this selfish species could ever even hope to find salvation. <br /><br />His commanding officers breakdown had affected him deeply and in a way it had disturbed him. He never wanted another person to feel the utter hopelessness he felt in knowing that their superiors had lost all hope. As a Captain he had decided from that moment he would never show such a weakness in front of his subordinates. He wanted to save them from that sickening feeling that this was all for nothing and no one knew what they were even fighting for anymore. He felt a surge of resolve in the heart he had already sacrificed to humanity the day he joined the recon.<br /><br />A man needed to be willing to sacrifice everything in order to change the world. </div></div><br /><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br />Additional Information (OOC): I had old man issues working out the coding so please excuse such a late up. -shakes fist at technology- <br /><br />Name/Nickname: Carmel<br />Time Zone: Sydney Australia<br />Contact Info: PM for link to FB~ or whatever you prefer.<br />Introduce yourself: Hello!

Although possessing a heavier build the weight is muscle and he is very agile and light on his feet. He wears his blonde hair in a 80/20 part split with a practical undercut<br /><br />Distinguishing Features: Erwin has a very striking face with a strong masculine jawline and prominent cheekbones. His eyebrows are however his most obvious facial feature due to their large size an peculiar shape. <br /></div></div><br /><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br />Personality: When people look at Erwin they may say he is a man who is very much ruled by his head and not his heart. However the true thoughts of the Commander are a lot more complex. Erwin Smith is a man that will listen to all feedback that is given to him, be it positive or negative or downright abusive with a very serious but stoic demeanor. He will accept the outcomes of his actions and is strong in the face of grim situations. He stands strong in the face of adversity by having full confidence in himself and having a clear image of what he wants to achieve. His composed nature can come off as cold and ruthless but he is not void of emotion and he does not wish for an unnecessary amount of people to die. He is fully aware that he is not infallible but he is a man whose determination and courage will lead him to never give up until the day his heart can no longer physically beat for humanity. <br /><br />Erwin does have the ability to send men to their deaths if it is for the greater good of humanity, a trait that is needed in his line of work even if it comes off as cold blooded to those who are not yet familiar with the true face of war and death. While he trusts his men to do their duty he knows that all people have the ability to make mistakes and there are only a few who he trusts completely. Past experiences will heavily influences his choices which could be considered merciless to those looking in at his decisions. The Commander however is not all talk and will actively follow through with his own words believing in what he does with all his heart and will give up everything including his humanity and happiness for the sake of the survival of mankind. <br /><br />Over the years it seems that his will to save humanity has led him to give up almost everything on a personal level. Behind his stoic mask you may however catch a glimpse of the human he once was and you will see a very fatherly man whose goal always has been and will be to unite humanity under the banner of freedom. He can be quite friendly in a personal setting and is especially colloquial with those he considers equals such as Hange, Mike and Levi.<br /><br />Erwin is a very honest man in the regard that he will never tell a lie he will however very often choose not to comment on a situation. He believes that a person should be fully educated on what they are fighting for and will not fill new cadets heads with false ideas of glory for all that join the recon corps and feels comfort from knowing that all that offer their hearts to humanity do so under their own free will. <br /><br />Calculative and far thinking he is a man that will never say something without thinking of its consequence. Sometimes what he says and does not make sense or can seem confusing but rest assure that it always does have something to do with the situation or possible future scenarios. <br /><br /></div></div><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br />History: ((Will be added to and altered as the canon is revealed ))<br /><br />Erwin was born within the walls of Sina during the years of peace and for his young life he was unaware that anyone suffered. He spent his time oblivious to such things and was much more focused on challenging his mind with puzzles, books or other things he was curious about solving.  Erwins uncle often traveled between the walls and when Erwin was old enough he requested to travel with him on one of his adventures even if that adventure was just business. However Erwin was surprised to see that not everyone enjoyed the life that he did and that got his mind thinking more and more. Having an advanced mind for a boy of his age it was forgivable for those around him to not think that he would understand things sooner or later and and that he would start to question things like corruption. As he aged he saw that those who he considered family, friends and neighbours seems to only care about sustaining their wealth and power within humanities center of existence. Peace had been as it is for decades but nothing had changed, were they really as great as they said if they were just the kings of their cages? He felt suddenly insignificant and in a way he was. He was set up to live a privileged and uneventful life where he lived in a happy bubble of ignorance while looking down at those who were not lucky enough to be born into a better situation and Erwin wanted more than that. <br /><br />Despite protest from his family he decided to join the military who only finally agreed after convincing them that his goal was to join the Military police. The training was hard work as he had only ever had training with horse riding when it came to physical exercise. Erwin had to work twice as hard to help catch up physically with the other cadets and after a growth spurt he became a decent enough solider to be ranked in within the top 10 of his graduating year alongside the likes of Hange Zoe, Mike Zakarius, Moses Brown and Nile Dawk. This achievement however was due to a lot of hard work and perfect scores in theory to make up for his shortcomings.<br /><br />Even from a young age he was quite set on joining the Survey Corps and worked very diligently at improving his abilities. With the ability to think very quickly on the spot when given a task his skills as a strategist and leader rapidly improved and became his obvious strength. <br /><br />Besides the plans to try and extend human territories, there was little else to do for the Survey Corps to do so his time was spent within the inner walls anyway, assisting the Military police in Criminal control. However Erwin always took this rather seriously and made a few enemies within the MP as well as solidifying an ever growing grudge between himself and Nile Dawk. At this point in his mind Erwin still carried part of his youthful but reserved enthusiasm and hope. He smiled more often and he had more trust in others as well as having a much more personal point to prove about changing the way things are run in the Military.<br /><br />As he gained more experience and had his first mission outside of the walls he did start to realize that there was more to changing the world than just being strong for others. He was soon counted on for his strategy and leadership skills and it was apparent that he was a born leader and by his mid twenties he had become a squad leader of his own squad. However he was required to choose his own squad which proved very difficult. Mike and Hange were two very obvious choices, he felt as if he could trust those two and both had very obvious strengths. Mike who was the best in his class in battle and Hange who could level out his more practical intellect with her ability to think outside the box. Erwins choices for the remaining members of his squad came from a very unexpected place, three thugs who had commandeered some black market maneuver gear and who had finally run out of luck selling one too many lots of Opium. <br /><br />Since seeing Levi use his gear he had his mind set on seeing Levi on his squad and knew he had a well of untapped potential even if that meant arguing for Levis freedom for a year after the thug was arrested. In the end Erwin became personally responsible for Levi and making sure that he behaved. <br /><br />Levi didn't join with the others, like Hange and Mike and came in and viewed the military with fresh eyes. Sometimes it takes an outsider to notice the changes and issues a person is experiencing and Erwin had not realized how far he had gone until he had a slap of reality given to him. Having a close friendship to Levi gives him reassurance that he is still human and also lets him share in that "outsider" view and not feel so institutionalized. Erwin is also aware that Levi is a beacon of hope for humanity, people view him as humanities strongest and their greatest. <br /><br />When Erwin was promoted to Commander those who remanded alive were all given promotions as well, along with their own squads. Despite his now highly ranked position he earned that completely on his own worth and not that of connections.  Even now that he is in his early thirties Erwin has yet to settle down with anyone or get married. In fact any thoughts or possibilities were given away the day he decided to accept the position of Commander. Right now he believes he could not devote what is needed to a spouse or family and chose to not seek that path in life.<br /></div></div><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br /><br />Likes: <br />Strategy games or any activity that gets him thinking: Erwin has a sharp mind and has a fondness of strategy games like chess and Poker. He also enjoys reading and doing research. <br /><br />Horse riding: Although there is little time now for him to enjoy horse riding on a recreational basis Erwin is very comfortable in the saddle. He is quite good at controlling a horse and doing trick riding. <br /><br />Drawing: Erwin is surprising good with his hands when it comes to the art of map and guide creation. He finds the creation of formation plans surprisingly enjoyable and has come up with many new and innovative strategies. He can also draw diagrams in a realistic fashion, again he no longer has the time to do this often on a recreational basis. <br /><br />Spicy food: The commander has a fondness for spicy cuisine, especially if it is spiced with red chillis. Back in his cadet years he was notorious in always making food extraordinarily spicy when it was his turn to help cook. The one luxury item that he will sometimes indulge in is dark chocolate favoured with chilli. <br /><br />Puns and play on words: To anyone that knows Erwin this would not come as a surprise. He secretly finds such jokes hilarious and will sometimes slip them into his own speech patterns while keeping a straight face which may leave you wondering if he did it on purpose.<br /><br />Blue is his favourite colour, his lucky number is 13 and he finds the smell of Lavender relaxing. <br /><br />Dislikes: <br />Ignorance: He finds blatant ignorance and stubborn idiocy very irritating. Erwin does try to combat this issue by being very honest, open and understanding of people, especially when he firsts meet them in hopes of setting a good base for a pleasant rapport between them, this however is not possible with all people and in all situations.<br /><br />Corruption: Erwin understands that not everyone has the fortitude and ability to face Titans in battle and harbours no resentment to those who choose not to fight. However those who actively exploit the system are people that lose respect in the eyes of the commander. If you are a hindrance to humanity than chances are you are heading to be disliked by Erwin.<br /><br />Laziness: Erwin recognizes that not everyone can reach greatness, in fact he states this honestly when he speaks. But he does believe one should do all they can to better themselves, to the best of their abilities.<br /><br />Abuse of power or potential: There is one thing that he dislikes more than people being lazy and that is those who make a decent effort to then only use to for negative means. Those who actively work hard just to join the military police come to mind as well as those who use their brilliant minds for selfish reasons. <br /><br /><br />Strengths: <br />Well spoken: Erwin has an eloquent way of speaking and can convey his ideas and arguments well which results in him successful persuading people to follow and trust him. He has the ability to deliver a stirring speech while keeping a very calm demeanor which gives him an aura of confidence and honesty that garner him respect. <br /><br />Collectedness: In the face of an adverse situation Erwin has the ability to remain composed and think rationally. This strength helps him remain calm even in the face of death or failure. <br /><br />Conviction: Erwin is not a man to say meaningless words in an eloquent manner. He believes in what he is fighting for with complete conviction and his words and actions ring true. <br /><br />Master of strategy and general intelligence: Erwin has a very gifted mind and has the ability to think in an unbiased and creative manner. He has the ability to assess people and the situation and think out many different motives and possibilities that could be accurate. <br /><br />Patience: Erwin has the ability to look at a plan long term strategy and wait for the right moment to implement his actions. <br /><br /><br />Weaknesses: <br />Stone cold alienation: After certain events in his life, Erwin has come to wear an emotional mask. He even finds it difficult to take this down in front of those he has known a long time and often will end up distancing himself from those who care about him or humanity in general. This is a Strength in some cases such as the battle field but on a personal level there is often a wall between him and his emotional opinion. He has a mindset that he has a limited future, will never live a normal life and has given up thoughts on marriage or family, to him the military is his family. He is very aware that his own humanity is a low on the priority list. In a nut shell he has difficultly turning 'commander mode' off. <br /><br />Lack of empathy: A symptom of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Erwin has little empathy for trivial everyday issues. He feels detached from others and emotionally numb at times. These are common symptoms with PTSD and the fact that he seems distant and closed off can cause many others to find him impossible to get close to and a few people who knew him before hand have taken his attitude change personally. He is still kind to newcomers he just can't open up to them. He simply has never had the time to sort out these issues. Erwins PTSD symptoms are mostly of the Avoidance and numbing variety. Due to all this he does have issues dealing with whining and 'high school' problems. <br /><br />His remaining personal agenda: As much as Erwin tries to keep an unbiased outward view on everything there are still some very big exceptions to his usual mindset. He believes that everyone was born equal but some humans are more equal than others and the fact that he honestly believes that unsettles him. He wants humanity to survive but also believes that some are more important to the world and need to live on. On that note as much of a power duo he and Levi make, Levi friendship is a weakness for Erwin. This being the case he always views Levis existence as very important and will put his live over the worth of many others. <br /><br />He is inwardly high strung: Erwin often runs the risk of burning himself out. He will often stay awake late into the night and forgets to sleep. He has an issue of setting himself personal limitations and often forgets that he still has a human body to look after while trying to get all his work done. He often needs someone to tell him to go sleep.<br /><br />Fears: <br />Failure: Erwin fears that he will fail in his goal to save humanity. It is a big ask of himself with a very high chance of happening and he is trying to create realistic fall backs for if he was to die. <br /><br />Humanity losing their faith in him: Erwin fears that he may go too far one day due to his method of throwing away his humanity to get results. He fears his alienation will cause him to be viewed as a monster by everyone and for them to cast him aside. The support and trust of those he considers his inner circle keep him feeling human. <br /><br />Losing those he cares for: Erwin is actually quite naturally a people person and honestly does enjoy the company of others. However he has created a select inner circle of friends who managed to make their way into his heart before he walled it off. This fear ties in with one of his weaknesses. He fears he will lose them. He fears that they will be gone and he will be unable to let anyone new into his life. He fears that this is when he will slip into losing his humanity completely. <br /><br />Quirks:<br />Erwin has an odd sense of humour that could be best described as 'dad humour'. He will often make puns and play on words when describing things although these will be done almost always completely straight faced so often they fly completely over peoples heads.<br /><br />Erwin has been noted to have no noticeable scent even by those with very sensitive noses. He will brush it off if you asked about it but that does not mean there is necessarily an underlying reason for lack of distinct smell. It could just be him quietly finding it amusing that it bothers a few people that he does not seem to acquire that unfortunate odour most soldiers get after a day of training.<br /><br /><br />Skillset: <br />Physical Strength: 9<br />Intelligence: 10<br />Teamwork: 7<br />Confidence: 10<br />Agility: 10 </div></div><br /><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br />Roleplay Sample: (this is also a little history for Erwin! )<br />~~Before the fall of Wall Maria~~<br /><br />Captain Erwins head hung as low as his current state of moral as the line of horses made it's way through the streets of the Shiganshina District. His eyebrows creased slightly and he felt a weird prickling sensation creep up the back of his neck. His mind was unable to shake away the thoughts of choices he could of changed to have assured a better outcome. His eyes flicked up for a moment as the drone of the crowd became louder and his mind finally focused on the curious mass of humans that had gathered to watch them return. As he glanced up, his eyes make contact with a young brown haired boy who was smiling at him with awed expression. Erwins eyes widened in for for a split second at the surprise that someone could still look at him like that. Right now he did not feel like he deserved that sort of admiring look and he quickly looked away as the feeling of shame threatened to engulf him. <br /><br />The recon corp has suffered one of the most overwhelming losses that Captain Erwin Smith had ever seen in his time in Military. Moral was appalling low within Legion and he could feel the sense of hopelessness lingered in everyones minds and left many feeling sick including Erwin himself. However, as horrific as the expedition had been it was not the feeling of loss that was bringing the taste of bile to his mouth, it had been the return home and the actions of his Commander. Erwin remained quiet during the whole ordeal, unable to look at the man as he dropped to his knees to tell Moses' mother that it had all been for nothing, the 12th Commander unable to cope with the guilt when faced yet again with grieving families and a jeering crowd. Moses Brown had not died believing he was giving his life for nothing and he felt as his Commanders actions were an insult to all those who had died. <br /><br />Erwin felt numb as they were finally able to leave the scene and the sound of hooves connecting with cobblestone drowned out the crowd as the remains of his companions made their way back towards the inner walls. As Erwin got a view of the commanders face he knew that the man would not last much longer in the position, the mans spirit was utterly shattered. However it was unlikely he would keep his job either way, he was quite sure that he would be demoted for his recent actions. But who would be the one they chose to take on the role as the next commander if that happened? This mission had seen the deaths of those who would have been considered decent candidates including Moses Brown who had rode beside the 12th Commander until his untimely death. <br /><br />When Erwin had joined the Recon Corps he had been wanting to change things, he wanted to make a difference and as embarrassed as he was now to admit it he wanted to save humanity. After joining the recon Erwin had quickly discovered that those who were not up to the task were quickly weeded out. He never thought that it was possible to have a worse experience than the feeling he had on his first mission but this expedition had been nightmarish. He knew now however there was so much that needed to be sacrificed before this selfish species could ever even hope to find salvation. <br /><br />His commanding officers breakdown had affected him deeply and in a way it had disturbed him. He never wanted another person to feel the utter hopelessness he felt in knowing that their superiors had lost all hope. As a Captain he had decided from that moment he would never show such a weakness in front of his subordinates. He wanted to save them from that sickening feeling that this was all for nothing and no one knew what they were even fighting for anymore. He felt a surge of resolve in the heart he had already sacrificed to humanity the day he joined the recon.<br /><br />A man needed to be willing to sacrifice everything in order to change the world. </div></div><br /><div style="float:left;width:375px;height:inherit;background-color:#E6E6E6;margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:2px;color:#000000;"><div style="height:inherit;overflow:inherit;font-size:11px;margin-left:5px;margin-right:5px;text-align:justify;line-height:12px;"><br />Additional Information (OOC): I had old man issues working out the coding so please excuse such a late up. -shakes fist at technology- <br /><br />Name/Nickname: Carmel<br />Time Zone: Sydney Australia<br />Contact Info: PM for link to FB~ or whatever you prefer.<br />Introduce yourself: Hello!
