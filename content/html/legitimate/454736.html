The longest period of time were there have been no living supercentenarian in the world (since the first verifiable case in the late 19th century) occurred between 14 October 1932, when <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("60723",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("60723")' href="/topics/Katherine_Plunket">Katherine Plunket</a><span class="hp" id="m60723"><div class="hpHeader">Katherine Plunket</div><div class="hpContent">Katherine Plunket  was an Irish aristocrat from County Louth, a prolific botanical artist and the oldest person in Irish history...</div><br></span>&nbsp;died, and 20 August 1952, when <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("11352",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("11352")' href="/topics/Betsy_Baker_(supercentenarian)">Betsy Baker</a><span class="hp" id="m11352"><div class="hpHeader">Betsy Baker (supercentenarian)</div><div class="hpContent">Betsy Russell Baker  was the first listed supercentenarian in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's then-oldest person...</div><br></span>&nbsp;turned 110 - a period of nearly 20 years.<br />
<br />
The first supercentenarian who lived in three different centuries was the first ever female supercentenarian, <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("36666",this,"margaret_ann_neve.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("36666")' href="/topics/Margaret_Ann_Neve">Margaret Ann Neve</a><span class="hp" id="m36666"><div class="hpHeader">Margaret Ann Neve</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i36666"></div>Margaret Ann Neve, née Harvey  of St. Peter Port, Guernsey, was the first recorded female supercentenarian, and the first supercentenarian of either sex in the 20th century.

Neve was in fact the only supercentenarian born in the 18th century that lived into the 20th century. This is contrasted to the hundreds of verified supercentenarians that have lived from the 19th century into the 21st century.<br />
<br />
Over 2,500 supercentenarians have been documented in history. It is likely that more have lived, but the majority of claims to have lived to this age do not have sufficient documentary support to be validated. This is slowly changing as those born after birth registration was standardized in more countries and parts of countries attain supercentenarian age.<br />
