HOW   TO   MAKE    A   PEDIGREE 


Air,  "Nelly  Gray" 


If  you'd  like  a  goodly  tree, 

With  a  branching  pedigree, 
Where  you'll  stand  forth  in  full  ancestral  fame, 

Just  employ  an  antiquary, 

Who  will  humor  your  vagary. 
And  have  everything  indorsed  with  some  great  name. 

If  the  good  Bernard  Burke 

Will  but  put  it  in  his  work. 
And  he'll  scarcely  have  the  heart  to  say  you  nay. 

What  though  Garter  King  should  scowl, 

And  the  Scotish  Lyon  growl? 
There's  no  power  that  can  take  your  tree  away. 

Chorus. 

Oh!  good  Bernard  Burke, 

Please  to  put  me  in  your  work, 
Sure  an  Irish  heart  will  never  say  me  nay; 

Then  though  Garter  King  may  scowl. 

And  the  Scotish  Lyon  growl, 
Where's  the  power  that  can  take  my  tree  away? 

As  the  Highland  Bible  showed. 
There  were  Grants  before  the  Flood, 
And  the  Grants  still  believe  it  to  a  man; 


And  the  like  proof  you  can  bring 

That  the  Coultharts  were  the  thing 
Ere  our  own  Anno  Domini's  began. 

Just  delete  a  letter  here, 

And  insert  another  there, 
And  interpolate  what  balderdash  you  please; 

With  this  Soldier  and  Crusader, 

And  that  Viking  and  Invader, 
You  may  soon  have  the  best  of  pedigrees. 

Chorus. 

Then  if  good  Bernard  Burke 

Will  but  put  you  in  his  work. 
And  if  once  you're  there  you're  pretty  sure  to  stay, 

What  though  Garter  King  should  scowl. 

And  the  Scotish  Lyon  growl? 
There's  no  power  that  can  take  your  name  away. 

You  must  never  care  a  straw 
Though  anachronism  or  flaw 
,  ^how  your  History  and  Heraldry  run  mad; 
;"_  ■'  "'Though  your  Peer  was  but  a  Ploughman, 
;•'..=  '■  And  you've  made  a  Man  a  Woman, 
;  'And'  you've  charters  when  no  charters  could  be  had. 
If  authorities  you're  scant  in, 
As  perhaps  they're  wholly  wanting, 
You  must  ne'er  on  that  account  lay  down  the  pen; 
Quote  Schiekfusius  and  Seniglesius, 
With  Rhubarbus  and  Magnesius, 
And  the  Devil's  self  can't  contradict  you  then. 


3 


Chorus. 


Then,  if  good  Bernard  Burke 

Will  but  put  them  in  his  work, 
You've  a  very  pretty  chance  that  there  they'll  stay; 

For  in  spite  of  Garter's  scowl, 

And  the  Scotish  Lyon's  growl, 
There's  no  power  that  can  take  such  stuff  away. 

But  I'll  give  you  here  a  hint 

Your  ambitious  views  to  stint: 
There's  a  limit  that  a  wise  man  will  not  pass. 

You  may  safely  vaunt  and  vapor, 

While  it's  only  done  on  paper, 
But  you'd  better  keep  from  panel  and  from  glass. 

For  if  there  you  lay  a  brush. 

It  may  put  you  to  the  blush. 
Should  the  Lyon  at  your  'scutcheon  make  a  dash; 

Your  Arms,  so  well  devised, 

Are  not  "duly  authorized," 
All  your  Quarters  may  some  morning  get  a  smash. 

Chorus. 

For  though  good  Bernard  Burke 

Might  still  keep  you  in  his  work, 
There  are  others  that  would  something  have  to  say; 

Old  Garter  with  his  law, 

And  the  Lyon  with  his  paw,  ^^ 

Might  then  mercilessly  tear  your  Coat  away!

To  the  memory 
of  my  dear  mother 

Judith  Sprague  Weston 

If  I  were  hanged  on  the  highest  hih, 
Mother  o'  inine,  0  mother  o'  mine! 

I  know  whose  love  would  follow  me  still, 
Mother  o'  mine,  0  mother  o'  mine! 

If  I  were  drowned  in  the  deepest  sea, 
Mother  o'  mine,  0  mother  o'  mine! 

I  know  whose  tears  would  come  down  to  me. 
Mother  o'  ?nine,  0  mother  o'  mine! 

If  I  were  damned  of  body  and  soul. 
Mother  o'  mine,  0  mother  o'  mine! 

I  know  whose  prayers  would  make  me  whole. 
Mother  o'  mine,  0  mother  o'  mine!"

THE   SONG  OF  THE  SHIP       * 

"Oh,  the  sweep  of  the  toppHng  crests, 

The  ocean's  salt  sea  foam, 
Where  the  roUing  Ijillows  comb, 

When  I  dance  upon  her  breast — 
With  the  winds  abeam  and  the  skies  agleam. 

In  the  hght  of  the  crimson  west; 
My  sails  a  white  cloud  and  I  sing  aloud 

In  a  glory  of  beauty  dressed! 

When  the  tempests  upon  me  pour 

My  body  groans  and  creaks, 
And  my  cordage  wails  and  shrieks 

'Midst  the  battling  billows"  roar; 
Oh,  I  sob  and  cry,  for  'tis  hard  to  die, 

And  be  known  by  the  seas  no  more. 
Though  torn  by  the  strain  yet  I  laugh  again, 

If  I  win  when  the  storm  is  o'er. 

When  I'm  safe  and  my  voyage  is  done, 

All  stowed  aloft,  alow; 
Then  the  winds  may  rail  and  blow, 

Who  cares  when  the  battle's  won! 
Oh,  the  sea,  the  sea!    'tis  the  place  for  me; 

'Tis  my  home!     Why  its  dangers  shun? 
Up,  up  and  away!     Though  I  die  to-day, 

I  shall  die  where  my  life  begun!" 


"Long  years  I've  waited  for  the  sight. 
My  ship  to  come  with  sails  so  white;. 
She  has  wandered  far  on  manv  a  shore." 


THE  OLD  CHURCH  AT  UPWEY,  DORSETSHIRE,  ENGLAND 


'They  are  going  down  the  valley,  the  deep,  dark  valley; 

^Ye'll  see  their  faces  nevermore 
Till  we  pass  through  the  valley,  the  deep  death-valley, 

And  meet  them  on  the  other  shore. 

They  have  laid  them  down  to  rest 

In  the  grave  so  cold  and  hard; 
Bury  me  with  the  friends  I  loved  the  best, 

Bury  me  in  the  old  ehurchvard." 


"It  is  not  necessary  to  learn  to  play  a  harp  in  this  world.     If  you 
win  one  in  the  next,  you  will  have  long  years  for  practice."

preface 

T  EM  PUS   FUGIT 

Come  one,  Come  all. 
I  am  your  Kinsman  true. 


Having  compiled  this  little  book  from  data  and  informa- 
tion kindly  given  me  by  many  different  families  (though 
not  so  correct  and  perfect  as  I  could  wish),  in  presenting  it 
to  my  numerous  kindred  I  crave  yovir  indulgence  for  any 
errors  or  omissions,  and  beg  you  will  not 

"View  it  with  a  critic's  eye, 
But  pass  my  imperfections  by," 

Wifli  a  s)iulc 

and  accept  it  in  the  same  spirit  of  love  and  good  will  in 
which  it  is  given.  I  was  born  on  the  twentieth  day  of  June, 
1830,  and  from  living  a  clean,  wholesome,  honest,  upright, 
frugal,  temperate,  and  simple  life,  as  our  good  old  grand- 
father did,  and  ever  having  in  mind  my  mottos, 

"Live  and  let  live," 
"Do  unto  others  as  you  would  have  others  do  unto  you," 

I  set  up  my  eighty-fourth  milestone  last  June,  with  fair 
prospects  of  reaching  our  grandfather's  age  of  eighty-seven 
years. 


I  strongly  advise  and  urge  the  present  generations  of  my 
kinsmen,  and  those  to  come  in  future  times,  to  follow  the 
good  example  of  our  fine  old  grandsire  in  living  frugal, 
simple,  and  hard-working  lives. 

With  love  and  good  wishes  for  my  kindred,  when  the  time 
comes,  I  invite  one  and  all,  who  feel  so  inclined,  to  come  to 
my  funeral  and  see  how  an  old  man  who  thinks  for  himself 
retires  to  the  embraces  of  old  Mother  Earth  for  his  everlasting 
rest  and  sleep.

MY  SHIPS 

'  How  many  ships  with  silken  sails 

I've  launched  upon  the  sea, 
When  glittering  waters  kissed  their  keels 

And  seraph  gales  were  free! 
I've  seen  them  start  for  cloudless  climes 

xVlong  a  star-bright  way ; 
Alas!  these  waiting  eyes  of  mine — 

Where  are  my  ships  to-day.^ 

I  scan  the  sea-encircled  shore: 

No  shi])  rocks  at  its  piers; 
No  pennons  fly  along  the  sky; 

The  wintry  chill  of  years 
Moans  at  my  heart,  at  night,  at  morn; 

Still  through  tlie  bickering  rain 
I'm  watching  for  my  silken  sails 

That  never  come  again."

Ancestors! 

Edward  Sprague  (a  fuller  by  trade)  lived  in  Upwey  in 
Dorsetshire,  England,  and  died  in  1614,  leaving  a  widow 
and  six  children. 

Three  of  the  sons  (Ralph,  29  years,  Richard,  24  years, 
and  William,  20  years)  sailed  from  England  in  1629  and 
landed  in  Salem,  and  in  the  summer  of  that  year  removed 
to  Charlestown,  where  they  with  a  few  others  were  the  first 
to  form  an  English  settlement.  William  in  1635  married 
Milicent  Eames,  and  in  1636  removed  to  Hingham.  They 
had  eleven  children,  and  eight  of  them  were  living  at  the 
time  of  his  death  on  October  26th,  1675.  His  widow  died 
on  February  8th,  1696. 

Samuel,  their  third  son,  born  in  1640,  removed  to 
Marshfield  prior  to  1664,  and  married  Sarah  Chilhng- 
worth. 

Samuel,  Jr.,  their  oldest  son,  married  Bejfthia  Thomas 
and  removed  to  Duxbury  before  1710,  and  John,  their 
second  son,  also  removed  to  Duxbury,  and  they  lived  on 
adjoining  farms,  inherited  from  their  father,  comprising 
230  acres,  called  Sprague's  Neck,  bounded  as  follows: — 
Beginning  at  a  point  near  what  is  now  known  as  Sprague's 
Wharf,  the  boundary  ran  along  the  shore  to  Blue-fish  River, 
thence  up  the  river  to  the  neighborhood  of  John  Alden's, 
thence  by  land  of  Jacob  Smith  to  meet  a  line  w4iich  ran 
westward  by  the  sites  of  the  village  school-house  and  the 
Methodist  Church  to  the  house  of  Daniel  Glass.  The  two 
farms  were  divided  by  the  road  now  called  Harrison  Street, 


that  on  the  south  being  occupied  by  Samuel  Sprague,  and 
that  on  the  north  by  his  brother  John. 

Phineas,  son  of  Samuel,  Jr.,  son  of  Samuel,  son  of  Will- 
iam, married  the  widow  of  his  cousin  Peleg,  son  of  John 
(maiden  name  Mercy  Chandler,  great-grand-daughter  of 
Francis  Sprague),  and  they  had  one  son — 


'Toiling — rejoicing — sorrowing, 
Onward  through  Hfe  he  goes; 
Each  morning  sees  some  task  begun, 

Each  evening  sees  its  close; 
Something  attempted,  something  done, 
Has  earned  a  night's  repose."" 

— Longfellow. 

GOOD-BY 

'  Friends  come  and  go — we  meet  and  pass 

Like  ships  upon  the  distant  main, 
A  sign,  a  smile,  a  word — alas, 

"  Good-by  ";  we  may  not  meet  again. 
Thus  have  we  met  with  joyful  hail. 

Thus  have  we  passed  upon  the  sea. 
And  I  have  said  to  you,  "  Farewell," 

x\nd  you  ha^•e  waved  "  Good-by  '"  to  me. 

Bon  voyage,  friend — with  calm  and  sun 
May  you  pursue  your  peaceful  way. 

And  haven  lost  or  haven  won. 

Bon  voyage  still  from  day  to  day!  " 


"Some  must  watch,  while  some  must  sleep: 
So  runs  the  world  awav." 


0ut  (§ranbfatt)er 
Hon.  Seth  Sprague 

was  born  on  July  4th,  1760,  in  the  old  house  on  his  father's 
farm,  and  on  the  death  of  his  father,  in  1775,  he  had  to  take 
entire  charge  and  care  of  said  farm  at  the  youthful  age  of 
fifteen.  He  was  sixteen  years  old  on  July  4th,  1776,  the 
day  on  which  the  Declaration  of  Independence  was  declared 
and  published.  In  1777  he  enlisted  as  a  private  in  the 
Continental  Army,  and  at  the  expiration  of  his  term  re- 
turned home  and  engaged  in  shore  fishing,  which  was  a 
very  hazardous  business,  as  many  English  ships  and  priva- 
teers were  cruising  along  the  coast. 

He  was  married  in  March,  1779,  when  in  his  nineteenth 
year,  to  Deborah  Sampson,  born  on  October  8th,  1761, 
and  she  rode  on  her  pillion  on  the  back  of  his  old  farm 
horse  with  him  to  her  new  home  in  his  old  farm-house, 
where  they  lived  together  most  happily  for  the  long  time  of 
sixty-five  years  up  to  the  time  of  her  death,  November  2d, 
1844.  With  hard  work,  frugality,  and  love  they  reared  and 
brought  up  the  large  family  of  fifteen  children,  four  sons 
and  eleven  daughters,  who  were  all  born  in  the  old  farm- 
house, and  all  married  (the  eleven  girls  in  the  old  home- 
stead) and  went  out  and  established  homes  for  themselves 
in  the  world  and  helped  on  the  progress  of  the  times. 

Our  grandfather  was  a  man  of  very  strong  constitution, 
vigorous,  energetic,  and  persistent;  and,  although  he  had 
but  little  schooling  in  his  boyhood,  his  great  natural  abil- 


ities  ripened  and  matured  with  age,  and  he  soon  developed 
into  one  of  the  leading  men  of  his  times. 

He  went  to  the  Grand  Banks  for  a  few  seasons  and  found 
fishing  a  hard,  laborious,  and  dangerous  work  with  small 
returns,  and  with  his  increasing  family  calling  for  better 
support  he  started  in  as  a  small  trader  with  such  success 
that  in  a  few  years  he  branched  out  and  commenced  ship- 
building, owning,  freighting,  and  selling  many  vessels  and 
establishing  himself  a  merchant  in  good  standing. 

He  was  always  ready  to  speak  and  work  for  any  good 
cause  or  object,  and  his  fellow-townsmen  were  pleased  to 
call  on  him  on  all  occasions  of  danger  and  emergencies,  and 
he  responded  quickly,  ably,  and  faithfully. 

He  was  elected  and  served  for  twenty-seven  years  in  the 
State  Legislature,  House  and  Senate,  and  worked  faithfully 
and  very  ably  for  the  interest  and  benefit  of  his  town  and 
county,  as  well  also  for  the  welfare  of  the  Commonwealth. 

He  was  twice  honored  by  being  chosen  a  member  of  the 
electoral  college,  which  decides  the  choice  of  President  and 
Vice-President  of  the  United  States. 

He  continued  his  hard  work  on  the  old  farm,  and  lived 
in  the  old  house  in  which  he  was  born  throughout  his  long 
eventful  and  happy  life,  to  the  ripe  old  age  of  eighty-seven 
years  on  July  8th,  1847,  with  the  esteem,  respect,  and  love 
of  the  whole  community,  who  followed  and  laid  him  in  his 
last  resting-place,  full  of  honors.  He  will  not  pass  this  way 
again. 

"Life's  blessings  all  enjoyed,  life's  labors  done. 
Serenely  to  his  final  rest  has  gone, 
While  the  soft  memory  of  his  virtues  j'et 
Lingers,  like  twilight  hues  when  the  bright  sun  is  set."

A    GOOD    CREED 

"To  be  able  to  look  every  man  squarely  in  the  eyes;  to 
make  friends  and  hold  them;  to  keep  clean  of  mind  and 
body;  to  smile  at  ill  fortune;  to  laugh  at  my  mistakes; 
to  frown  when  temptation  comes  a- visiting;  to  be  ready 
with  a  word  of  cheer  w^hen  that  word  will  help;  to  strive 
to  develop  to  the  utmost  the  heart,  head,  and  hand  qual- 
ities endowed  by  the  Ruler  over  all;  to  hold  all  women  in 
respect  and  to  love  one;  to  weave  the  thread  of  eternal 
optimism  into  the  lives  of  all  with  whom  I  may  come  in 
contact;  to  worship  Nature  and  the  Great  Spirit  that  con- 
ceived it  all, — in  a  word,  to  play  the  game  of  life  with  a 
steady  hand  and  a  qualmless  conscience  and  a  real  desire 
to  be  of  service — that  is  my  religion.  And,  say,  if  I  can 
hve  up  to  the  mark,  don't  you  think  I've  corralled  about 
all  the  creed  that  is  necessary?" 


\ 


"The  end  crowns  all; 
And  that  old  common  arbitrator.  Time, 
Will  one  day  end  it." 


"  Look  up,  not  down — 
At  all  this  little  life's  mistakes! 
Quick,  smooth  away  that  scornful  frown — 
There!     Now  a  little  smile  awakes. 

Look  up,  not  down; 
Good  cheer  brings  back  the  old  renown. 
Aye,  when  the  light  of  morning  breaks 
And  saddened  earth  at  last  awakes, 
Where  think  you  we  shall  wear  our  crown.^ 

Look  up,  not  down!  " 


(grantrfatfjer 


Though  I  look  old,  yet  I  am  strong  and  lusty ; 
For  in  my  youth  I  never  did  apply 
Hot  and  rebellious  liquors  in  my  blood ; 
Nor  did  not  with  unbashful  forehead  woo 
The  means  of  weakness  and  debility : 
Therefore  my  age  is  as  a  lusty  winter, 
Frosty,  but  kindly."

Let  no  day  pass  without  some  acknowledgment  of  your 
indebtedness  to  her.  Study  her  unspoken  wishes;  receive 
her  opinion  with  respect,  yield  your  will  to  hers  with  perfect 
sweetness.  In  all  that  she  allows  you  to  do  for  her,  show, 
by  your  zeal  and  cheerfulness,  that  for  her  sake  the  employ- 
ment is  delightful." 


Warm  summer  sun, 
Shine  kindly  here. 
Warm  southern  wind. 
Blow  softly  here. 
Green  sod  above. 
Lie  light,  lie  hght. 
Good  night,  dear  heart. 
Good  night,  good  night.

'Love  is  merely  a  madness,  and,  I  tell  you,  deserves  as  well  a  dark  liouse 
and  a  whip  as  madmen  do." 


"Life's  but  a  walkinj;  sliadow,  a  ))oor  player 
That  struts  and  frets  his  hour  upon  the  stage. 
And  then  is  heard  no  more." 


"Why  should  this  day  he  one  of  joy  to  me? 

Why  should  kind  words  and  gifts  be  mine  to  have.' 
Life  came  unsought  by  me:   its  mystery 

Grows  apace,  and,  from  cradle  to  the  grave. 
I  must  unlearn  what  self  would  teach.     To  feel, 

To  know,  to  see,  to  live,  to  simply  be. 
To  sit  with  folded  hands,  to  wound,  not  heal, 

To  meet  the  daily  cross  with  apathy. 
Are  these  the  highest  ends  that  I  can  find? 

Owe  I  not  more  to  her  who  gave  uic  l)irth 
Than  to  the  world,  or  self,  or  all  mankind? 

I'll  try  to  make  a  heaven  on  this  earth. 
And  to  this  end  my  soul  shall  rise  and  say, 
'This  shall  be  called  not  mine — but  "Mother's  Day.""

On  being  asked  "Whence  is  the  flower?  " 

'  In  May,  when  sea  winds  pierced  our  solitudes, 
I  found  the  fresh  Rhodora  in  the  woods. 
Spreading  its  leafless  blooms  in  a  damp  nook, 
To  please  the  desert  and  the  sluggish  hrook. 
The  purple  petals,  fallen  in  the  pool,  ^ 

Made  the  l)laek  water  with  their  lieauty  gay: 
Here  might  the  redhird  come  his  plumes  to  cool 
And  court  the  flower  that  cheapens  his  array. 
Rhodora!    if  the  sages  ask  thee  why 
This  charm  is  wasted  on  the  earth  and  sky. 
Tell  them,  dear,  that  if  eyes  were  made  for  seeing. 
Then  Beaut,\-  is  its  own  excuse  for  being: 
Why  thou  wert  there,  O  rival  of  the  rose! 
I  never  thought  to  ask.  I  never  knew: 
But.  in  my  simple  ignorance,  suppose 
The  selfsame  Power  that  brought  me  there  brought  vou.

TO   MY   MOTHER 

"  A  mother  heard  our  infant  cries. 

And  folded  us  with  fond  embrace. 
And  when  we  woke,  our  infant  eyes 
Were  opened  on  a  mothers  face. 

Our  wishes  she  (Hd  make  lier  own. 

Her  bosom  fed  and  pillowed  too. 
Answering  each  start  or  fitful  moan 

With  trembling  pulses  fond  and  true. 

Then  knowledge  was  a  thing  untaught: 

Heaven's  charity,  a  daily  dole. 
Stole  in  inaudibly,  and  wrought 

Its  gentle  bonds  about  the  soul." 


'  Hers  was  sweetest  of  sweet  faces, 
Hers  the  tenderest  eyes  of  all; 
In  her  hair  she  had  the  traces 

Of  a  heavenly  coronal. 
Bringing  sunshine  to  sad  places 
Where  the  sunlight  could  not  fall. 


■'  Rest,  my  baby,  rest 
In  thy  downy  nest."

'Sweet  is  the  memory  of  distant  friends. 
Like  the  mellow  rays  of  the  departing  sun. 
It  falls  tenderly  yet  sadly  on  the  heart." 


LOVE 

'Love  is  a  dream  that  knows  no  waking, 
Love  is  a  bond  that  knows  no  breaking; 
Memories  pass  in  a  mist  of  tears. 
Love  grows  stronger  through  the  years. 

Life  is  a  rugged  pathway  lifting. 
Life  is  an  isle  that  is  ever  drifting; 
Visions  call,  and  we  vainly  follow. 
Love  is  the  goal  over  hill  and  hollow. 

Death  is  a  dream  tliat  knows  no  waking. 
Death  is  a  bond  that  knows  no  breaking; 
Headlines  rise  from  the  fading  foam. 
Love  is  the  light  that  leads  us  home."

"  We  will  not  from  the  helm  to  sit  and  weep, 
But  keep  our  course,  though  the  rough  wind  say  no, 
From  shelves  and  rocks  that  threaten  us  with  wreck." 


'Oh!   tell  me  not  the  woods  are  fair.  The  wild  waves"  thunder  on  the  shore. 

Now  Spring  is  on  her  way;  The  curlew's  restless  cries, 

Well,  well  I  know  how  brightlj-  there  Unto  my  watching  heart  are  more 

In  joy  the  young  leaves  play;  Than  all  earth's  melodies. 

How  sweet  on  winds  of  morn  or  eve,  Come  back!  my  ocean  rover,  come! 

The  violet's  breath  may  be;  There's  but  one  place  for  me. 

Yet  ask  me,  woo  me  not  to  leave  Till  I  can  greet  thy, swift  sail  home, 

jNIy  lone  rock  by  the  sea.  My  lone  rock  by  the  sea."

THE  SEA'S  SPELL 

"  Beneath  thy  spell,  O  radiant  summer  sea — 
Lulled  by  thy  voice,  rocked  on  thy  shining  breast. 
Fanned  by  thy  soft  breath,  l)y  thy  touch  caressed — - 
Let  all  thy  treacheries  forgotten  he. 
Let  me  still  dream  the  ships  1  gave  to  thee 
All  golden-freighted  in  fair  harbors  rest; 
Let  me  believe  each  sparkling  wave's  white  crest 
Bears  from  thy  depths  my  lo\'ed  and  lost  to  me. 
Let  me  not  heed  thy  wrecks,  nor  coiuit  tliy  slain. 
As  o'er-fond  lovers  for  love's  sake  forget 
Their  dearest  wrongs  so  I,  with  eyes  still  wet 
With  thy  salt  tears,  with  heart  still  wrung  with  pain, 
Back  to  thy  fierce,  sweet  beauty  turn  again. 
And,  though  thou  wreck  me,  will  I  love  thee  yet."

'Oil.  a  life  oil  the  ocean  wave, 

A  home  on  the  rollinji'  deep. 
Where  the  scattered  waters  rave. 

And  the  winds  their  revels  keep; 
Like  an  ea,t;lc  caged,  I  ])ine 

On  this  dull,  unchanging  shore: 
Oh,  give  me  the  flashing  brine. 

The  s])ray  and  the  tempest's  roar! 

Once  more  on  the  deck  I  stand 

Of  my  own  swift-gliding  craft : 
Set  sail!  farewell  to  the  land! 

The  gale  follows  fair  abaft. 
We  shoot  througli  the  sparkling  foam 

Lilie  an  ocean  bird  set  free; 
Like  the  ocean  bird,  our  home 

We'll  find  far  out  on  the  sea. 

The  land  is  no  longer  in  view. 

The  clouds  have  begun  to  frown; 
But  with  a  stout  vessel  and  crew. 

We'll  say,  Let  the  storm  come  down! 
And  the  song  of  our  hearts  shall  be. 

While  the  wind  and  the  waters  rave, 
A  home  on  the  rolling  sea! 

A  life  on  the  ocean  wave!  "

■'I  count  myself  in  nothing  else  so  happy.

And  as  my  fortune  ripens  with  thy  love, 
It  shall  be  still  thy  true  love's  recompense."

"  Remember  me  when  I  am  gone  away, 
Gone  far  away  into  the  silent  land 
When  you  can  no  more  hold  me  by  the  hand, 
Nor  I  half  turning  go,  yet  turning  stay. 
Remember  me  when  no  more,  day  by  day, 
You  tell  me  of  your  future  that  you  planned; 
Only  remember  me:  you  imderstand 
It  will  be  too  late  to  counsel  then  or  pray. 
Yet  if  you  should  forget  me  for  a  while 
And  afterwards  remember,  do  not  grieve, 
For,  if  darkness  and  corrujjtion  leave 
A  vestige  of  the  thoughts  that  once  I  had. 
Better  by  far  you  should  forget  and  smile 
Than  that  you  should  remember  and  be  sad."

THE  WAYS 


BY  JOHN  OXENHAM 


'  To  every  man  there  openeth 
A  way,  and  ways,  and  a  way. 
And  the  high  soul  climbs  the  high  way, 
And  the  low  soul  gropes  the  low; 
And  in  between,  on  the  misty  flats. 
The  rest  drift  to  and  fro. 
But  to  every  man  there  openeth 
A  high  way  and  a  low. 
And  every  man  decideth 
The  way  his  soul  shall  go."

"The  little  cares  that  fretted  me, 

I  lost  them  yesterday 
Among  the  fields  above  the  sea, 

Among  the  winds  at  play; 
Among  the  lowing  of  the  herds. 

The  rustling  of  the  trees, 
Among  the  singing  of  the  birds. 

The  humming  of  the  bees. 


The  foolish  fears  of  what  may  happen, 

I  cast  them  all  away 
Among  the  clover-scented  grass, 

Among  the  new-mown  hay; 
-Vmong  the  husking  of  the  corn 

Where  drowsy  poppies  nod, 
Where  ill  thoughts  die  and  good  are  born. 

Out  in  the  fields  with  God."

"The  angel  of  the  flowers  one  day 
Beneath  a  rose-tree  sleeping  lay, — 
That  spirit  to  whom  charge  is  given 
To  bathe  young  buds  in  dews  from  heaven. 
Awakening  from  his  light  repose. 
The  angel  whis]5ered  to  the  rose, 
'O  fondest  object  of  my  care. 
Still  fairest  found  where  all  is  fair. 
For  the  sweet  shade  thou  hast  given  me 
Ask  what  thou  wilt,  'tis  granted  thee.' 
Then  said  the  rose  with  deepen'd  glow, 
'On  me  another  grace  bestow.' 
The  spirit  paused,  in  silent  thought. 
What  grace  was  there  that  flower  had  not? 
'Twas  but  a  moment — o'er  the  rose 
A  veil  of  moss  the  angel  throws; 
And,  robed  in  nature's  simplest  weed, 
Could  there  a  flower  that  rose  exceed?"

THE   DIARY  OF  PILGRIM   GEORGE   SOFLE 

The  Mayflower,  September  6-November  11,  1620 

"It  lies  upon  the  libraiy  desk, 

A  diary  brown  and  old; 
The  leather  back  is  torn  away, 

The  pages  blurred  with  mould; 
But  still  a  sentence  here  and  there 

Is  left  by  time  to  show 
The  hopes  and  fears  of  Pilgrim  Soule, 

Who  kept  it  long  ago. 

In  what  a  stiff,  old-fashioned  hand 

His  solemn  thoughts  were  penned, 
And  how  the  Mayflower  must  have  rolled, 

For  half  the  letters  blend! 
And  here  he  enters  "Grievous  sick," 

And  here,  "A  child  was  born," 
And  later  on,  "A  sailor  dyed 

This  holy  Sabbath  morn." 

He  mentions,  too,  a  Mistress  Anne 

He  left  across  the  sea 
In  some  old  garden  hedged  with  box 

And  haunted  by  the  bee; 
And  if  you  hold  this  tattered  leaf 

Between  you  and  the  light. 
You  still  can  see  the  pilgrim's  tear 

That  blistered  "Land  in  sight!" 

In  stately  tomb  and  simple  mould 

The  Pilgrim  Fathers  sleep, 
Forgetting,  in  their  final  rest. 

The  perils  of  the  deep. 
The  Mayflower,  with  her  oaken  ribs, 

Is  nothing  but  a  name; 
But  Pilgrim  Soule,  your  little  book 

Outlived  your  sturdy  frame!"

No  I'onnt  of  deep,  strong;,  deathless  love,  save  that  within 
A  mother's  heart!" 


'A  mother's  love — how  sweet  the  name! 

What  is  a  mother's  love? 
A  noble,  pure  and  tender  flame 

Enkindled  from  ahove. 
To  bless  a  heart  of  earthly  mould. 
The  warmest  love  that  can  grow  old — 

This  is  a  mother's  love." 


"A  mother  is  a  mother  still, 
The  holiest  thins  alive."

On  his  brow  the  wrinkles  tell 

That  life's  journey's  almost  through, 
Then  cheer  his  footsteps  down  life's  path — 

What  a  friend  he's  been  to  you!

Speak  for  father  one  kind  word. 

For  his  joiu'ney's  almost  through; 
You  know  he'll  love  to  hear  you  say 

What  a  friend  he's  been  to  you. 

Speak  for  father  one  kind  word;  Though  your  childhood  days  are  past, 

Don't  forget  where'er  you  go,  Though  his  locks  are  turning  gray, 

In  your  youth  his  watchful  eye  Still  the  love  remains  the  same. 

Guided  and  protected  you;  Just  as  pure  and  fresh  to-day. 

All  his  deeds  were  those  of  love,  Mother's  love  to  us  is  dear. 

No  unkind  or  selfish  thought  Never  was  a  friend  more  true. 

Could  ever  for  a  moment  dwell  But  one  kind  word  for  father  speak. 

In  his  fond  and  trusting  heart.  He  is  just  as  dear  to  you."

ARE  THE   CHILDREN  AT  HOME? 

"Each  day  when  the  glow  of  sunset 

Fades  in  the  western  sky. 
And  the  wee  ones,  tired  of  playing. 

Go  tripping  lightly  by, 
I  steal  away  from  my  husband. 

Asleep  in  his  easy-ehair. 
And  watch  from  the  open  doorway 

Their  faces  fresh  and  fair."

"'Man  wants  hut  little  here  below. 

Nor  wants  that  little  long.' 
'Tis  not  with  me  exactly  so; 

But  'tis  so  in  the  song. 
My  wants  are  many,  and,  if  told, 

Would  muster  many  a  score; 
And  were  each  wish  a  mint  of  gold. 

I  still  should  long  for  more." 


"I  count  myself  in  nothing  else  so  happj'. 
As  in  a  soul  remembering  my  good  friends; 
And,  as  my  fortune  ripens  with  my  love, 
It  shall  be  still  thy  true  love's  recompense."

HEART  VENTURES 

"I  stood  aiul  watched  my  ships  go  out 
Each  one  by  one,  unmooring  free. 
What  time  the  quiet  harbor  filled 
Willi  flood-tide  from  the  sea. 

The  first  tliat  sailed,  her  name  was  Joy, 
She  spread  a  smooth,  white  ample  sail. 

And  eastward  drove  with  bending  spars 
Before  the  singing  gale. 

Another  sailed,  her  name  was  Hope. 

No  cargo  in  her  hold  she  bore. 
Thinking  to  find  in  Western  lands 

Of  merchandise  a  store. 

The  next  that  sailed,  her  name  was  Love. 

She  showed  a  red  flag  at  the  mast, — 
A  flag  as  red  as  blood  she  showed, 

And  she  sped  south  right  fast. 

The  last  that  sailed,  her  name  was  Faith; 

Slowly  she  took  her  passage  fortli; 
Tacked  and  lay  to;  at  last  she  steered 

A  straight  course  for  the  north. 

My  gallant  ships  they  sailed  away 
Over  the  shimmering  summer  sea; 

I  stood  at  watch  for  many  a  day, 
But  one  came  back  to  me. 

For  Joy  was  caught  by  Pirate  Pain, 
Hope  ran  upon  a  hidden  reef. 

And  Love  took  fire  and  foundered  fast ' 
In  whelming  seas  of  grief. 

Faith  came  at  last,  storm-bent  and  torn, 
She  recompensed  me  all  my  loss, 

For  as  a  cargo  safe  she  brought 
A  crown  linked  to  a  cross."

HE   GIVETH  HIS  BELOVED  SLEEP 


'"He  giveth  His  beloved  sleep' — 
O  wondrous  .sweet  and  restful  boon! 
For  since  the  weary,  sultry  noon, 
We've  trod  the  pathway  sharp  and  steep; 
What  greater  could  He  gi^e  than  sleej)? 

'He  giveth  His  beloved  sleep' — 
The  very  promise  brings  a  peace 
In  which  the  stings  of  thorns  now  cease, 
And  soft  rest  comes  as  shadows  creep, 
To  bring  forgetfulness  in  sleep. 


Oh,  what  are  we  that  this  sweet  sleep 

He  gives  to  His  beloved  should  rest 

On  us,  unworthy  to  be  blest? 

0  lo\-e  so  great,  in  mercy  deep 

He  folds  round  us  this  robe  of  sleep. 

Exce]&gt;t  the  Lord  the  city  keep, 
The  watchman  wakes  in  vain  from  sleep. 
Then  trust,  and  rest,  O  eyes  tliat  weep, 
As  evening  winds  the  grasses  .sweep, 
So  'He  giveth  His  beloved  sleep.' 


Sweet  roses  soothe  the  warrior's  sleep; 
Yet  as  he  drinks  the  dew  in  death 
There  comes  a  peace  on  wings  of  breath 
Far  sweeter  than  the  white  rose  heap, — 
'He  giveth  His  beloved  sleep.'"

THE  SHIP  THAT  NEVER  RETURNED 

"On  a  summer  day  when  tlie  waves  were  rippled 
By  the  softest,  gentlest  breeze. 
Did  a  ship  set  sail  with  a  cargo  laden 
For  a  port  beyond  the  seas. 
There  were  sweet  farewells. 
There  were  loving  signals. 
While  a  form  was  yet  discerned. 
For  they  knew  it  not,  "twas  a  solemn  parting, 
For  the  ship,  she  never  returned. 

Chorus 

Did  she  ever  return? 
No,  she  never  returned. 
Her  fate  is  yet  unlearned. 
Though  for  years  and  years 
There  were  fond  ones  watching 
For  the  ship  that  never  returned. 

Said  a  feeble  lad  to  his  anxious  mother: 

'I  must  cross  the  wide,  wide  sea. 

For  they  say,  perchance,  in  a  foreign  climate. 

There  is  health  and  strength  for  me.' 

"Twas  a  gleam  of  hope  in  a  maze  of  danger — 

Her  poor  heart  for  her  youngest  yearned. 

Yet  she  sent  him  forth  with  a  smile  and  blessing 

On  the  ship  that  never  returned. 

'Only  one  more  trip,"  said  a  gallant  seaman. 

As  he  kissed  his  weeping  wife; 

'Only  one  more  bag  of  this  golden  treasure. 

And  "twill  last  us  all  through  life. 

Then  I"ll  spend  my  days  in  my  cosey  cottage 

And  enjoy  the  rest  I've  earned." 

But,  alas,  poor  man !  for  he  sailed  commander 

Of  the  ship  that  never  returned."

"Alone  ill  the  firelight  I'm  dreaming,

Is  that  of  a  guardian  angel 
Who  smiles  on  me  tenderly. 
When  the  golden  leaves  of  the  autumn 
Were  fast  falling  one  by  one, 
You  slipped  through  the  gates  of  the  sunset 
To  rest  and  peace  and  home."

HAD:  WHOSE  LIFE  WAS  AN  INSPIRATION:  WHOSE  MEMORY  A 
BENEDICTION." 


epilogue 

After  one  year  and  eight  months  of  pleasant,  agree- 
able, and  interesting  correspondence  with  many  different 
families  scattered  throughout  the  United  States  and  other 
parts  of  the  world,  and  search  in  several  graveyards  and 
cemeteries  as  well  as  in  various  Town  Records,  I  have  com- 
pleted this  little  book  and  made  it  as  perfect  as  possible 
from  the  data  received.  There  are  many  dates  of  births, 
marriages,  and  deaths  missing,  left  for  each  family  to  fill 
in  for  themselves. 

I  would  recommend  and  advise  that  each  family  of 
generation  after  generation  growing  up  should  keep  cor- 
rect records  of  dates  and  information  relating  to  itself, 
that  in  the  future  some  one  of  them  may  continue  this 
record  of  the  Sprague  Families  from  time  to  time,  as  gen- 
erations come  and  go,  marching,  marching,  marching  on, 
their  tramping  be  heard  throughout  the  corridors  of  all 
future  time,  as  a  numerous  army  of  Sprague  Descendants, 
ever  increasing.

"Do  your  best  for  one  another. 
Making  life  a  pleasant  dream. 
Help  a  worn  and  weary  brother 
Pulling  hard  against  the  stream." 

MY  TASK  IS  FINISHED 

AND 

I  WILL  BID  YOU  GOOD-BY 

AND 

SAY  FAREWELL  TO  ONE   AND  ALL 
FOR  TIME   EVERLASTING 

I  WRITE   FOR  THE  LAST  TIME 

Completeb 

AND  LAY   DOWN   MY   PEN 

FAREWELL 

"  Farewell !     Farewell !     The  billows  break 
On  distant  deeps  and  shores  descending. 
Farewell!     Farewell!     From  lite  awake 
And  know  that  friendsliip  hath  no  ending! 

Within  those  radiant  realms  of  sleep — 

That  sleep  whose  portals  thou  dost  sunder — 

Dreamless,  unwearied,  thou  shalt  keep 

Guard  o'er  our  souls  that  watch  and  wonder. 

Farewell!     Farewell!     The  night  is  dark. 

And  low  the  distant  bells  are  tolling. 
Farewell!     Farewell!     Far  speeds  thy  bark. 

Nor  harbors  where  the  waves  are  rolling. 

Safe  in  the  port,  the  sail  drops  low, — 

The  mariner  of  tides  heeds  never, — 
But  from  the  prow  a  light  shall  flow 

To  guide  our  storm-tossed  craft  forever." 

THE  END 

amen 

"THE  WEB  OF  OUR  LIFE  IS  OF  A  MINGLED  YARN,  GOOD  AND 
ILL  T0(;ETHER." 

"THE  END   CROWNS  ALL, 
AND    THAT    OLD    COMMON    ARBITRATOR,  TIME, 
WILL  ONE  DAY  END   IT."

BEAUTIFUL   DUXBURY 

BY    LUCY    PORTER   HIGGINS 


'Beautiful  Duxbury!     Dream  of  the  sea! 
Who  that  has  loved  tliee  l)ut  turns  back  to  thee! 
^Yho  that  has  loved  thee  but  calleth  thee  fair, — 
With  sighs  for  a  breath  of  tJiy  pure  morning  air; 

II. 

For  the  blue  of  thy  skies,  and  the  blue  of  thy  wave, 
Where  the  white  sails  glide,  and  the  sea-birds  lave; 
For  the  fragrant  Pine,  over  hill  and  afar; 
For  the  long  cool  drives  where  the  green  woods  are! 

III. 

In  many  a  grave  'neath  the  quiet  shade 
Is  the  dear  dead  dust  of  our  fathers  laid: 
Tliere  the  children  come  and  the  birds  sing  free; 
There  we  fain  would  rest  when  the  end  shall  be. 


IV. 

Beautiful  Duxbury:  down  through  the  years 
Float  voices  and  visions,  seen  often  through  tears, — 
Of  the  Pilgrim's  home,  and  his  tireless  hand. 
And  the  changeless  faith  of  the  Pilgrim  Band. 


V. 

Their  ]iomes  were  thy  liills!     Their  graves  are  thy  trust! 
And  his  spirit  still  thrills  in  thy  veins — as  it  must; 
Thy  rose-curtained  mornings,  thy  sunsets'  I'ed  gold, 
E'en  the  mists  of  thy  valleys,  his  presence  enfold. 

VI. 

And  his  message  is  there — it  is  writ  on  the  sky: 
'For  Freedom  I  came,  and  for  Freedom  I  die! 
For  that  crossed  the  ocean,  the  wilderness  trod; 
And  my  gift  to  the  race  is  the  Freedom  of  God ! " 

VII. 

Beautiful  Duxbury :  oft  in  my  dreams 
I  stand  on  thy  shores  in  the  moonlight  gleams — 
And  I  see  thee  asleep  in  tlie  hush  of  night, 
While  the  stars  go  bv  in  the  holv  light. 


&amp;^ 


VIII. 

Beautiful  Duxbury:  sometime  I  shall  lie 

With  thy  peaceful  dead,  while  the  stars  go  by; 

I  shall  lie  near  dear  hands  that  grew  cold  in  my  clasp. 

And  my  heart  be  at  rest  in  Death's  long,  strong  grasp. 

IX. 

And  the  years  will  flee,  as  the  years  have  flown; 
And  the  birds  will  sing  in  the  same  sweet  tone; 
And  the  murmuring  Pine,  and  the  murmuring  sea, 
Beautiful  Duxbury,  still  sing  of  thee." 


'Up!  up!  in  nobler  toil  than  ours 

No  craftsmen  bear  a  part: 
We  make  of  nature's  giant  powers 

The  slaves  of  human  art. 
Lay  rib  to  rib,  and  beam  to  beam, 

And  drive  the  treenails  free; 
Nor  faithless  joint,  nor  yawning  seam, 

Shall  tempt  the  searching  sea." 


— Wkittier. 


'"Build  me  straight,  O  worthy  master. 
Staunch  and  strong,  a  goodly  vessel. 
That  shall  laugh  at  all  disaster, 
And  with  wave  and  whirlwind  wrestle.' 

Day  by  day  the  vessel  grew. 
With  timbers  fashioned  strong  and  true, 
Stemson  and  keelson  and  sternson-knee, 
Till,  framed  with  perfect  symmetry. 


All  is  finished!  and  at  length 

Has  come  the  bridal  day 
Of  beauty  and  of  strength, 

To-day  the  vessel  shall  be  launched. 


-Longfellow.

'My  ship  has  sailed  on  many  seas, 
Since  she  was  launched  in  shadow- 
land  ; 
In  raging  storm  or  gentle  breeze 

Her  helm  has  answered  my  com- 
mand. 

In  tropic  climes,  by  flowered  shores. 
She  went  with    spotless    sails   un- 
furled; 

Past  youth's  Bahamas  and  Azores, 
The  jil)  was  shot  to  gird  the  world. 

Far  to  the  North,  in  many  a  port. 

In  search  of  gold — on  pleasure  bent; 
Puffed  up  with  pride  or  drunk  with 
sport. 
Round   all   the   world   she   swiftly 
went. 


MY  SHIP 

At  last  the  frozen  zone,  the  dark, 


That  frighten  seekers  of  the  pole; 
Ice,  floes,  and  wind,  the  gaunt  wolf's 

bark. 
The  doubt  and  questioning  of  the 

soul! 

Then    rescue,    help    from    stranger's 
hands, 
^Yhen  hope  was  faint  and  love  was 
dead ; 
Back  by  the  quays  of  foreign  lands. 
To  home  and  friends  my  good  ship 
sped. 

Here,  in  this  haven,  free  from  care, 
A  few  brief  moons  she'll  take  her  rest; 

Till  one  day  in  the  sunset's  glare 
My  ship  will  vanish  to  the  West." 


BALLADE  OF  A  SAILOR 

"He  sails  the  inscrutable  seas. 

His  joy  is  the  glad  vessel's  flight; 
He's  a  slave  to  the  skipper's  decrees, 

He's  a  rollicking,  rolling  wight; 

His  wisdom,  it  may  be,  is  slight, 
His  love  is  the  salt  wave's  swirl; 

But  whatever  his  age  or  his  plight — 
He's  fond  of  his  grog  and  his  girl. 

He  hails  the  propitious,  cjuick  breeze. 

If  it  comes  in  the  day  or  the  night; 
He's  forced  to  relin(|uish  his  ease. 

He's  coni])elled  to  renounce  his  delight; 

When  the  rigging  is  frozen  and  tight. 
He's  ordered  to  make  and  to  furl; 

But  though  he's  obedient  quite — 
He's  fond  of  his  grog  and  his  girl. 

If  in  peril,  mayhap  on  his  knees 

He  prays  with  the  all  of  his  might; 
And  what  if  his  j)enitence  flees 

The  moment  the  good  ship  is  right? 

Yet  danger  he  oft  may  invite. 
Or  an  oath  at  its  imminence  hurl: 

But  here  I  would  chiefly  recite — 
He's  fond  of  his  grog  and  his  girl. 

En^'OY 

His  manner  is  bluff,  and  his  spite 
Is  as  brief  as  his  pipe-smoke's  curl: 

But  again  I  am  urged  to  indite — 
He's  fond  of  his  grog  and  his  girl." 


There  is  a  pleasure  in  the  pathless  woods, 

There  is  a  rapture  on  the  lonely  shore, 

There  is  society,  where  none  intrudes, 

By  the  deep  Sea,  and  music  in  its  roar : 

I  love  not  Man  the  less,  but  Nature  more. 

From  these  our  interviews,  in  which  I  steal 

From  all  I  may  be,  or  have  been  before. 

To  mingle  with  the  Universe,  and  feel 

What  I  can  ne'er  express,  yet  cannot  all  conceal. 

Roll  on,  thou  deep  and  dark  blue  Ocean — roll! 

Ten  thousand  fleets  sweep  over  thee  in  vain; 

Man  marks  the  earth  with  ruin — his  control 

Stops  with  the  shore;   upon  the  watery  plain 

The  wrecks  are  all  thy  deed,  nor  doth  remain 

A  shadow  of  man's  ravage,  save  his  own, 

When  for  a  moment,  like  a  drop  of  rain. 

He  sinks  into  thy  depths  with  bubbling  groan, 

Without  a  grave,  unknell'd,  uncoffin'd,  and  unknown." 


To  your  judgments  give  not  the  reins 
With  too  much  eagerness,  like  him  who  ere 
The  corn  be  ripe  is  fain  to  count  the  grains: 
For  I  have  seen  the  briar  through  the  winter  snows 
Look  sharp  and  stiff — yet  on  a  future  day 
High  on  its  summit  bear  the  tender  rose: 

And  ship  Fve  seen,  that  through  the  storm  hath  passed. 
Securely  bounding  o'er  the  watery  way. 

At  entrance  of  the  harbor  wrecked  at  last."

MOTHER  EARTH 


"Onward  in  unresting  round, 

Yielding  to  the  Sun-god's  miglit, 
Knowing  neither  goal  nor  bound. 
Day  by  day  and  night  by  night. 

Mother  Earth  her  law  fulfils. 
Circling  through  the  vast  inane, 

Bearing  human  joys  and  ills. 

Life  and  death  and  boon  and  banc. 

We,  the  human  mites  that  creej). 
Crowd  and  jostle,  climb  and  fall. 

Born  of  earth,  in  earth  to  sleep, — 
What  are  we  to  face  the  All? 

Yet  we  know  our  mother's  ways, 
Know  her  moods  benign  or  cold. 


And  that  she  her  Lord  obeys. 
As  she  did  obey  of  old. 

Long  ere  she  our  race  could  bear. 

When  but  monstrous  births  she  knew, 

And  that  onward  she  must  fare. 
Yielding  still  obedience  true. 

When  our  race  hath  swarmed  and  passed, 
When  she  can  no  more  bring  forth. 

Rolling  blindly  'mid  the  vast. 
Withered,  lifeless,  nothing  worth. 

Till  at  length — so  say  the  seers — 
Ever  drawn  to  the  Master's  breast, 

Marking  ever  briefer  years. 
She  hath  sunk  to  perfect  rest." 


THE  EARTH  AND   MAN. 


"A  little  sun,  a  little  rain, 

A  soft  wind  blowing  from  the  west — 
And  woods  and  fields  are  sweet  again, 
And  warmth  within  the  mountain's 
breast. 

So  simple  is  the  earth  we  tread. 

So  quick  with  love  and  life  her  frame. 
Ten  thousand  years  have  dawned  and 
fled 
And  still  her  magic  is  the  same. 


A  little  love,  a  little  trust, 

A  soft  impulse,  a  sudden  dream. 

And  life  as  dry  as  desert  dust 

Is  fresher  than  a  mountain  stream. 

So  simple  is  the  heart  of  man. 
So  ready  for  new  hope  and  joy. 

Ten  thousand  years  since  it  began 
Have  left  it  younger  than  a  boy." 


'The  watery  grave  now  opens  all 
Dreadful  from  below, 
When  waves  move  the  sea  and 
Stormy  winds  do  blow; 
But  when  the  danger's  over 
And  safe  we  come  on  shore, 
The  horrors  of  the  tempest 
We  think  of  no  more."

SONG 

"The  boat  is  tied; 

My  treasure's  home; 
No  need  have  I  to  sail  the  sea; 
No  more  need  roam 
'Gainst  storm,  nor  ride 
On  waves  that  beat  incessantly. 

Now,  at  the  end. 

What  has  it  brought? 
Not  wealth,  but  things  of  greater  worth: 
Love  and  a  friend. 
For  these  I  sought 
And  found  them  all  about  the  earth. 

God  speed  the  wind 
Who  sets  his  sail 
Nor  waits  for  sun  or  sparkling  star! 
Oh,  may  he  find 
His  holy  grail 
Though  storm  should  bear  his  boat  afar ! '

'America  is  a  glorious  nation, 
In  this  world  there's  none  like  she. 
For  they  are  the  boys  who  planted  a  tree, 
That  planted  a  tree  called  Liberty. 
Long  may  live  this  t'ree-born  nation. 
Long  may  live  the  rights  of  man. 
For  we've  a  right  to  the  Constitution 
Erected  by  George  Washington." 


FOR  FREEDOM'S  BIRTHDAY 

'Dearer  and  yet  more  dear  Over  the  land  and  the  sea 
As  we  learn  her  untold  worth  Her  starry  banner  flies, 

Grows  Freedom  year  by  year  Its  field  of  blue  in  purity 

When  we  celebrate  her  birth.  Matching  our  nortliern  skies,

That  what  was  our  ])ortion  made 

We  may  give  a  yet  happier  age. 
And  that  blazoned  glory  never  may  fade 

From  History's  fairest  page." 


"I  do  love 
My  country's  good  with  a  respect  more  tender, 
More  holy  and  profound,  than  my  own  life." 


'Under  the  wide  and  starry  sky  This  be  the  verse  you  grave  for  me: 

Dig  the  grave  and  let  me' lie.  'Here  he  lies,  where  he  longed  to  be; 

Glad  did  I  live,  and  gladly  die.  Home  is  the  sailor,  home  from  the  sea.

"As  life  runs  on,  the  road  grows  strange 
With  faces  new,  and  near  the  end 
The  milestones  into  gravestones  change, 
'Neath  every  one  a  friend." 


"  In  every  land 

It's  all  the  same — 
The  spade  at  last 

Trumps  every  game."

SO    WE    GROW    OLD 

A  broken  toy;   a  task  that  held  away 
A  yearning  chikl-heart  from  an  hour  of  play; 
A  Christmas  that  no  Christmas  idols  brought; 
A  tangled  lesson,  full  of  tangled  thought; 
A  homesick  boy;   a  Senior  gowned  and  wise; 
A  glimpse  of  life,  when,  lo!  the  curtains  rise 

Fold  over  fold. 
And  hangs  the  picture,  like  a  boundless  sea — 
The  world,  all  action  and  reality — 

So  we  grow  old. 

A  wedding,  and  a  tender  wife's  caress; 

A  prattling  babe  the  parents'  life  to  bless; 

A  home  of  joys  and  cares  in  equal  part; 

A  dreary  watching  with  a  heavy  heart: 

And  death's  dread  angel  knocking  at  the  gate, 

And  hope  and  courage  bidding  sorrow  wait 

Or  loose  her  hold; 
A  new-made  grave,  and  then  a  brave  return 
To  where  the  fires  of  life  triumphant  burn — 

So  we  grow  old, 
Old  to  ourselves,  but  children  yet  to  be, 
In  the  strange  cities  of  eternity." 


10 


GROWING    OLD    GRACEFULLY 

■  Softly,  oh,  softly,  the  years  have  swept  by  thee, 

Touching  thee  lightly  with  tenderest  care; 
Sorrow  and  death  they  have  brought  nigh  thee, 
Yet  they  have  left  thee  but  beauty  to  wear. 
Growing  old  gracefully, 
Gracefully  fair. 

Far  from  the  storms  that  are  lashing  the  ocean. 
Nearer  each  day  to  the  pleasant  home  light; 
Far  from  the  waves  that  are  big  with  commotion. 
Under  full  sail  and  the  harbor  in  sight. 
Growing  old  gracefully. 
Cheerful  and  bright. 

Past  all  the  winds  that  were  adverse  and  chilling, 

Past  all  the  islands  that  lured  thee  to  rest. 
Past  all  the  currents  that  lured  thee  unwilling. 
Far  from  thy  course  to  the  land  of  the  blest. 
Growing  old  peacefully. 
Peaceful  and  blest."

'But  ah,  how  we  sigh 
While  hoping'  for  the  best, 
As  years  roll  by 
The  heart  will  find  its  rest; 
But  hope  soon  dies 
And  sorrow  holds  her  sway. 
For  many  that  we  learn  to  prize 
Soon  pass  away. 

Refrain. 

But  just  as  of  old 

The  moments  come  and  go. 

The  spring  with  its  flowers, 

And  the  winter  with  its  snow, 

The  hours  pass  away. 

The  seasons  warm  and  cold. 

And  time  rolls  along  to-day 

Just  as  of  old." 


"  Temp  us  Jug  it! 
So  make  the  most  of  it. 
While  you  are  alive,  gather  roses; 
For,  when  you  are  dead. 
You're  dead  a  damned  long  time. 


'Use  almost  can  change  the  stamp  of  nature. 
And  either  curb  the  devil  or  throw  him  out 
With  wondrous  potency." 


"I  shall  pass  through  this  world  but  once.  Any  good  thing,  there- 
fore, that  I  can  do,  or  any  kindness  that  I  can  show  to  any  human 
being,  let  me  do  it  now.  Let  me  not  defer  it  or  neglect  it,  for  I  shall 
not  pass  this  way  again."

THE   PALE   BOATMAN 

'In  that  cold  and  ancient  wherry. 
By  that  thronged  though  fearful  ferry, 

O'er  that  hold  and  boisterous  river, 
See  that  boatman,  bending  ever. 

He  has  toiled  for  every  nation 
Since  the  birthday  of  creation. 

When  old  Eve,  our  primal  mother. 

Wiped  the  death  damp  from  Cain's  brother, 

Then  that  boatman  took  that  wherry 
And  first  crossed  that  fearful  ferry; 

Looked  he  stern  and  pale  beside  it, 
At  that  first  time  that  he  tried  it. 

iNIortals!     You  and  I  must  go  in 
That  same  boat  which  he  is  rowing." 


'Come  softly,  years,  though  you  come  swift. 
That  thinking  not  of  you  life's  way  I  go, 
Glad  for  the  sun,  the  rain,  love's  precious  gift — 
Then,  sudden,  find  the  hills  are  white  with  snow! 

And  if  there  be  no  meeting  past  the  grave. 

If  all  is  darkness,  silence,  A^et  'tis  rest; 

Be  not  afraid,  ye  waiting  hearts  that  weep. 
For  God  still  giveth  his  beloved  sleep. 

And  if  an  endless  sleep  he  wills — so  best." 


'Like  as  a  plank  of  driftwood,  tossed  on  the  watery  main, 
Another  plank  encounters,  meets,  touches,  parts  again, 
So  tossed  and  drifting  ever,  on  life's  unrestful  sea. 
Men  meet  and  greet  and  sever,  parting  eternally."

"  In  reading  the  few  interesting  pages  of  Hon.  Seth 
Sprague's  diary,  one  must  bear  in  mind  the  very  meagre 
opportunities  for  schoohng  boys  had  in  his  day  and  at  the 
time  of  his  father's  death,  when  he  was  only  a  child  of  fifteen, 
he  was  obliged  to  devote  himself  to  the  whole  care  of  the 
farm  to  support  his  mother  and  grandmother.  He  was 
sixteen  years  old  on  the  day  of  the  Declaration  of  Indepen- 
dence, and  at  nineteen  years  of  age  married  Deborah  Samp- 
son in  1779.  He  was  a  highly  honored  citizen  of  Duxbury. 
For  forty  years  Justice  of  the  Peace.  For  twenty-seven  years 
in  succession  a  member  of  the  Massachusetts  Legislature, 
both  in  the  House  and  Senate.  Several  times  chosen  one 
of  the  Counsellers  to  the  Governor  of  Massachusetts,  but 
always  declined  the  honor.  Appointed  by  the  President  of 
the  United  States  principal  assessor  for  the  Thirteenth 
District  of  Massachusetts.  Twice  honored  by  being  chosen 
a  member  of  the  Electoral  College,  which  determine  the 
choice  of  the  President  and  the  Vice  President  of  the  United 
States.  He  was  active  in  all  the  important  movements  for 
the  improvements  of  his  native  town.  In  his  day  the  spell- 
ing was  different  from  the  spelling  of  today."

REMINISCENCES  OF  HON.  SETH 

SPRAGUE 


I,  Seth  Sprague,  being  old  and  infirm  and  lonely,  for 
the  double  purpose  of  amusing  myself  and  informing  my 
children  of  the  fashions  of  olden  times  and  of  some  few  things 
that  took  place  in  this  town  and  county  and  at  the  beginning 
of  the  American  Revolution,  I  now  sit  myself  down  to  write 
some  of  them.  There  were  many  things  that  took  place  at 
that  time  too  minute  and  trivial  to  be  recorded  in  general 
history,  that  may  be  somewhat  interesting  to  those  who 
did  not  live  at  that  day.  i 

The  town  of  Duxbury  was  truly  a  Whig  town.  There 
were  but  two  Torys  in  it.  One  was  Gamaliel  Bradford, 
father  of  the  late  Col.  Gamaliel  Bradford,  the  other  was 
Briggs  Alden,  father  of  the  late  Maj.  Judah  Alden. 

Immediately  after  the  Lexington  battles  they  both  made 
their  recantation  in  writing  at  the  Town  Meeting  and  asked 
forgiveness.  Copies  of  their  letters  are  now  on  the  town 
records. 

Marshfield  was  a  Tory  town,  perhaps  the  most  so  of  any 
in  this  state.  In  the  year  1773  and  4,  a  majority  of  the 
people  of  that  town  were  Torys,  there  was  at  that  time  a 
great  degree  of  enmity  between  the  Wigs  of  Duxbury  and 
the  Torys  of  Marshfield.  The  Torys  applied  and  obtained 
from  Gen.  Gage  a  company  of  soldiers.  They  were  stationed 
at  the  house  of  Ray  Thomas,  now  owned  by  Daniel  Webster. 


This  company  of  soldiers  were  at  Marshfield  about  four 
months  chiefly  in  the  winter  of  1775. 

They  often  traveled  about  the  town  of  Duxbury  much 
to  the  terror  of  the  women.  Immediately  on  the  news  of 
the  battle  at  Lexington,  two  regiments  of  what  was  then 
called  Minutemen  marched  towards  Marshfield  in  order  to 
take  this  single  company  of  British  soldiers.  Had  they 
marched  directly  to  their  quarters,  they  might  have  been 
taken  prisoners  without  a  drop  of  blood  being  shed,  as  their 
captain  afterwards  was  heard  to  say  that  he  should  not 
thought  of  making  any  resistance  to  so  formidable  a 
force. 

But  the  American  soldiers  instead  of  marching  directly 
to  the  quarters  of  the  enemy,  one  regiment  quartered  one 
night  in  Duxbury  and  the  other  in  Marshfield,  two  miles 
from  the  enemy. 

This  delay  gave  an  opportunity  for  the  British  soldiers  to 
embark  on  board  a  vessel  that  was  sent  from  Boston  to  re- 
ceive them.  The  Torys  of  Marshfield  who  had  taken  an 
open  and  active  part  in  favor  of  the  oppressive  acts  of  the 
British  Government  went  off  to  the  British  at  Boston, 
others  that  had  been  less  active  remained  at  home,  but 
the  Whigs  of  Duxbury  searched  every  house  in  Marshfield 
that  was  thought  to  be  inhabited  by  a  Tory  and  took  all 
the  fire  arms  they  could  find.  Ray  Thomas  went  off  with 
the  British,  but  he  left  his  family  at  Marshfield. 

A  man  by  the  name  of  Dunbar  belonging  to  Bridgewater 
bought  some  fat  cattle  of  Mrs.  Thomas  and  drove  them  to 
Plymouth,  he  killed  one  of  them.  Before  it  was  splitten  in 
two,  the  people  found  out  that  it  came  from  Ray  Thomas' 
farm;  they  put  it  into  a  cart,  spread  it  open  in  such  a  man- 


ner  that  Dunbar  could  sit  in  the  body  of  the  Ox.  They 
then  commanded  him  to  get  in;  they  seated  him  in  the  body 
of  the  Ox  and  put  the  Tripe  over  and  on  his  head  and  drove 
him  on  to  Kingston.  There  another  set  of  men  took  him 
to  Duxbury,  then  quite  a  number  of  Duxbury  men  drove 
him  on  to  Marshfield.  I  was  then  a  great  boy  about 
fourteen  years  old.  I  was  among  the  rabble  of  boys  that 
went  hooting  and  hollowing  behind  the  cart. 

They  drove  the  cart  up  within  two  rods  of  the  front  door, 
told  Dunbar  to  get  out,  then  tipped  up  the  cart  and  let  the 
Ox  shde  out. 

Mrs.  Thomas  was  a  well  informed,  prudent,  discreet 
woman,  she  opened  her  front  window  and  addressed  the 
company  in  such  a  manner  as  I  have  reason  to  think  made 
some  of  them,  at  least,  very  much  ashamed. 

I  can  now  remember  but  a  very  small  part  of  her  speech. 
She  told  the  company  that  the  Collector  was  calling  on  her 
to  pay  a  large  tax,  which  she  felt  very  anxious  to  pay  and 
that  Mr,  Thomas'  creditors  were  calling  on  her  for  their  due, 
which  she  was  willing  to  pay  as  far  as  she  could.  Although 
it  was  good  fun  for  me  to  follow  Dunbar  with  tripe  on  his 
head,  I  got  somewhat  frightened  before  I  got  home. 

Some  of  the  men  began  to  talk  of  paying  Uncle  Phineas 
a  visit,  meaning  my  father.  One  of  them  observed  that  'he 
expected  his  pot  would  split  before  Spring.'  I  fully  under- 
stood what  they  meant. 

I  think  such  was  the  excitement  at  the  time,  that  if  it 
had  not  been  night,  or  nearly  so,  when  the  rabble  got  back 
to  Duxbury,  my  father's  beef  barrel,  at  least,  would  have 
been  riffled,  for  it  had  at  that  time  some  beef  in  it  that  came 
from  Ray  Thomas'  farm. 


4 


At  the  time  Ray  Thomas  went  away  he  was  owing  my 
father,  about  $50.00  on  the  note  of  hand  and  he  was  fearful 
of  losing  it.  He  asked  Mrs.  Thomas  if  she  would  let  him 
have  a  fat  Ox  on  account  of  that  note  and  she  very  willingly 
let  him  have  the  Ox. 

This  act  was  thought  by  some,  at  that  time  to  be  very 
criminal  in  my  father,  but  my  father's  fat  never  split  or 
the  Beef  poisoned  any  of  the  family.  Previous  to  the  war, 
there  were  Liberty  poles  raised  in  every  town  in  the  State. 
We  had  a  very  high  one  in  Duxbury;  it  stood  near,  where 
the  Gershom  Bradford  house  now  stands.  There  was  a 
great  gathering  of  people  at  the  raising  of  it.  It  was  some- 
what of  a  terror  to  evil  doers.  If  any  one  was  suspected  of 
being  a  Tory,  he  was  threatened  to  be  histed  up  on  the 
Liberty  Pole.  I  have  observed  that  the  love  of  Liberty 
which  our  Pilgrim  fathers  brought  with  them  when  they 
landed  on  Plymouth  Rock  has  decended  down  not  only  to 
the  third  and  fourth  generation  but  to  the  sixth  and 
seventh.  A  very  great  proportion  of  the  people  in  Dux- 
bury  are  descendants  from  the  Pilgrims  who  came  to  Plym- 
outh in  the  May  Flower  or  in  other  vessels  soon  after.  It 
may  be  interesting  to  some  to  know  the  particular  spots  of 
ground,  on  which  the  first  settlers  built  their  houses.  I 
need  not  mention  in  this  narrative  where  Captain  Standish, 
Elder  Brewster  or  John  Alden  located  their  houses — that 
is  very  generally  known.  I  know  of  but  three  farms  in  this 
town  of  Duxbury,  at  this  time  owned  by  men  of  the  same 
name  of  the  men  who  first  settled  on  them,  I  mean  those 
on  which  our  Pilgrim  fathers  settled.  The  heirs  of  the  late 
Major  Judah  Alden  own  the  farm  on  which  John  Alden 
settled.     Barker  Hunt  owns  the  farm  on  which  Edmont 


Hunt  settled.  Seth  Sprague  owns  the  farm  on  which 
Francis  Sprague  settled. 

Francis  Sprague's  house  stood  on  what  is  commonly 
called  'Sprague's  Neck,'  a  little  south  of  where  the  stage 
office  now  is.  Experience  Mitchel's  house  stood  where  the 
Stage  Office  now  is. 

Edmund  Hunt's  house  stood  not  far  from  where  Barker 
Hunt's  house  now  stands.  Constant  Southworth's  house 
stood  nigh  where  the  Duxbury  cloth  factory,  now  made 
into  a  tack  factory. 

A  man  by  the  name  of  Howland,  whose  Christian  name 
I  have  forgotten  settled  nigh  where  the  Universal  Meeting 
House  now  stands. 

There  was  once  a  Quaker  Meeting  House,  a  little  south  of 
where  the  stage  office  now  is,  they,  like  the  other  Quakers, 
were  persecuted,  but  not  to  that  degree  they  were  in 
Massachusetts. 

There  is  a  very  ancient  Burying  Ground  on  the  high 
ground,  a  little  north  of  the  Methodist  Meeting  House.  I 
think  the  ground  that  was  occupied  for  that  purpose  is 
about  four  rods  square,  it  is  my  opinion,  that  the  Quakers 
were  buried  there,  however  that  may  be,  I  am  sure  a  num- 
ber of  people  are  buried  there.  Where  I  was,  I  could  see 
the  graves  very  plainly,  it  was  well  known  to  the  old  people, 
seventy  or  eighty  years  now  past  and  gone,  that  there  was  a 
burying  place  there,  I  have  often  heard  my  father  speak  of  it. 

The  manner  of  living  and  the  fashions  have  greatly 
changed  since  I  was  young.  I  can  remember  when  there 
was  not  a  four  wheeled  charrage  of  any  kind  in  the  town 
of  Duxbury  and  but  one  shays,  and  if  that  was  on  hand 
now,  as  good  as  it  was  that  day,  it  would  not  sell  for  ten 


6 


dollars.  People  of  that  day  rode  almost  holly  on  horse- 
back and  a  horse  that  would  not  carry  double  was  consid- 
ered of  little  value.  By  '  carrying  double '  which  was  a  com- 
mon expression  at  that  day,  77ient  carrying  a  man  with  a 
woman  on  a  pillion  behind  him  and  I  myself  have  rode 
many  a  mile  on  horseback  with  my  wife  behind  me,  with 
a  child  in  her  arms. 

I  remember  when  there  was  but  one  floor  in  the  town  of 
Duxbury  that  had  a  carpet  on  it  and  that  was  of  the  kind 
that  was  at  that  time  called  Rag  coverlids;  it  was  thought 
at  that  time  to  be  very  extravagant  to  put  a  coverlid  on 
the  floor  to  tread  on. 

I  remember  perfectly  well  the  manner  of  living  eighty 
years  now  gone.  Very  little  tea  or  coffee  was  then  used  by 
the  people  in  the  country  towns.  My  father  was  considered 
to  be  an  independent  farmer  and  lived  as  well  and  in  as 
good  fashion  as  the  people  of  the  town  generally. 

In  the  faul  of  the  year,  and  for  some  time  after  killing  their 
Beef  and  Pork,  for  dinners  they  would  have  fresh  meat  but 
seldom  any  for  supper  or  breakfast,  that  was  most  com- 
monly of  milk  or  broth,  as  when  meat  was  boiled,  either 
fresh  or  salt,  the  broath  was  to  be  thickened  with  Indian 
meal  and  it  was  a  common  saying,  that  '  the  person  who 
would  eat  no  broath  ought  to  have  no  meat.' 

When  meat  or  fouls  were  rosted,  the  fashion  was  first,  to 
put  the  gravy  and  Indian  pudding  on  to  the  table  and  let 
the  meat  or  foul  stand  by  the  fire  untill  the  company  had 
eaten  of  the  pudding  and  gravy,  this  was  the  fashion  when 
I  was  a  boy  say  of  six  or  seven  years  of  age;  by  degrees  it 
altered  which  occasioned  some  disputes  between  the  old 
people  and  the  young. 


I  remember  this  when  I  was  a  young  man  or  rather  a 
great  boy.  I  happened  to  be  at  the  house  of  Thomas  Water- 
man at  Marshfield  on  business.  At  dinner  time,  (the  fam- 
ily consisted  of  his  mother  and  himself) ,  his  mother  was  not 
only  an  old  woman,  but  an  old  fashioned  woman.  They  had 
a  piece  of  rosted  beef  for  dinner;  the  old  woman  according  to 
the  old  fashion,  put  the  pudding  and  gravy,  on  the  table,  the 
son  says,  'Mother,  put  the  meat  on  the  table.'  The  old 
lady  says,  'No,  eat  the  pudding  and  gravy  first.'  The 
son  says  again,  'Mother  do  put  the  meat  on  the  table.' 
The  old  lady  again  answers  in  somewhat  of  an  angry  tone, 
'  You  shall  not  have  the  meat  until  you  have  eat  the  pud- 
ding and  gravy.'  The  son  then  arose  from  the  table,  took 
the  meat  from  before  the  fire,  set  it  on  the  table,  cut  a  good 
slice  and  put  it  on  my  plate,  the  old  lady  all  the  time 
scolding  most  vemenUy,  so  that  I  dare  not  eat  the  meat,  until 
the  son  said.  Young  man,  eat  the  meat,  don't  mind  mother.' 

I  remember  when  I  was  a  boy,  in  the  winter,  my  father 
got  up  early  one  morning;  after  making  a  large  fire,  he 
hung  on  a  pot  with  bean  porrage  in  it  and  then  go  to  the 
barn  to  feed  the  cattle.  My  mother  would  get  up  soon  and 
crumb  bread  and  put  it  into  the  pewter  dishes  and  by  the 
time  my  father  came  from  the  barn,  the  Bean  porridge 
would  be  hot.  My  mother  would  then  take  a  wooden 
ladle  dip  some  of  the  Bean  porridge  from  the  pot  and  put 
it  into  the  pewter  basons,  my  father  and  mother  would  eat 
out  of  one  bason,  myself  and  two  sisters,  out  of  the  other. 
My  mother  would  then  put  the  porrage  pot  away,  wash  the 
two  basons,  then  go  to  weaving  or  spinning. 

A  short  time  after  I  was  married,  I  mounted  an  old  team 
horse  and  went  four  miles  to  fech  my  wife  home.     I  took 


8 


her  pillion,  for  girls  at  that  time  always  kept  a  pillion  and 
fastened  it  behind  my  saddle  and  so  we  both  rode  to  the 
house,  where  she  spent  the  remainder  of  her  days,  which  was 
sixty  four  years.  It  was  nearly  supper  time  when  she  got 
to  her  new  home  and  she  made  some  milk  porrage  for  sup- 
per, we  both  eat  out  of  one  dish.  The  King  on  his  throne 
with  all  the  luxurys  that  the  world  could  afford  could  not 
be  happier.  Our  furniture  consisted  of  six  second-handed 
old  fashioned  chairs,  one  white  pine  table,  three  or  four 
pewter  plates,  two  wooden  plates  and  a  small  quantity  of 
brown  earthen  ware,  made  at  Charlestown,  and  a  small 
quantity  of  hollow  ware  and  our  house  was  as  well  furnished 
as  was  those  of  young  beginners  at  that  day,  in  country 
towns  generally. 

Not  only  the  fashions  of  living  have  greatly  altered  since 
my  first  remembrance,  but  all  other  fashions. 

In  olden  times  the  Deacon  of  the  Church,  always  read  the 
Psalm  or  Hymn,  line  by  line,  for  the  singers,  on  the  Sab- 
bath, to  sing  and  they  always  read  with  a  tone  lengthing 
out  each  word  as  long  as  they  could  blow  out  their  breath 
and  when  the  choir  of  singers,  first  began  to  sing  without  the 
Deacon's  assistance,  the  old  people  often  left  the  meeting. 

In  the  old  times  of  which  I  am  writing,  it  was  very 
common  to  give  nick  names  to  both  men  and  women,  it  was 
so  common  that  I  have  known  young  people  who  did  not 
know  the  real  name  of  some  of  the  old  people. 

It  was  also  very  fashionable  to  make  short  rymes  on  each 
other.  There  was  a  very  homely  man  in  Duxbury,  by  the 
name  of  Judah  West,  who  used  to  work  in  the  ship  carpen- 
ter's yard  and  divert  the  company  with  his  rymes.  One  of 
the  young  men  of  the  gang  of  carpenters,  got  married  and 


9 


a  few  days  after,  asked  Uncle  Judah  to  make  a  verse  on 
him.  Uncle  Judah  said,  'he  was  afraid  if  he  did  he  would 
be  mad,'  but  he  promised  he  would  not,  so  Uncle  Judah 
complyed  with  his  request  and  delivered  his  verse  right  off 
without  any  premeditation — 

'I  pray  I  he  Lord 
That  Thomas  Ward 
May  not  iiicreas  his  seed, 
Tliat  our  town  may  not  abound. 
With  that  accurssed  breed. 
For  they  will  steal  l)otli  meal  and  meal, 
And  every  thing  that's  good. 
Posts  and  Rails,  lie  never  fails 
To  take  for  fii'e  wood.' 

After  making  a  verse  on  each  man  working  with  him  in 
the  ship  yard,  he  made  one  on  himself — 

'There  is  old  Judah  the  drouge 
With  his  augur  and  gouge 
With  his  elauter  hees  and  white  eyes 
He  oft  times  glories  in  telling  long  stories, 
Whieh  most  pe()i)le  take  to  be  lies.' 

In  those  olden  times  there  was  much  more  reverence  paid 
to  ministers  than  there  is  at  this  time,  so  much  so  the  chil- 
dren of  that  day,  many  of  them,  at  least,  thought  that 
they  were  something  more  than  men.  I  remember  that 
when  I  was  a  boy,  Parson  Turner  used  to  visit  my  father's 
house,  he  wore  a  very  large  white  wig,  he  was  a  very  austere 
man  and  I  was  exceedingly  afraid  of  him. 

I  will  now  endeavor  to  write  a  few  words  on  the  rise, 
progress  and  decline  of  business  in  the  town  of  Duxbury 
at  the  close  of  the  American  Revolution.

The  people  of  Duxbury  were  very  poor.  It  ought  to  be 
recorded  to  the  credit  of  four  ship  carpenters,  all  poor  and 
without  any  literary  attainments,  Ezra  Weston,  Nathaniel 
and  Joshua  Winsor  and  Samuel  Delano.  They  were  men 
of  good  sound  common  sense,  men  of  uncommon  industry, 
energy,  perseverance  and  economy.  The  two  Mr.  Win- 
sors  went  immediately  into  Bank  Fishing  and  the  humble 
writer  of  this  narritive  went  in  their  employ  to  the  Grand 
Banks  to  hall  the  Cod-line.  Ezra  Weston  and  others  fol- 
lowed the  example  of  the  Winsors. 

The  fishing  business  was  then  good,  Fish  sehing  from 
five  dollars  to  five  and  a  quarter.  The  fishing  business 
and  the  ship  carpenter's  business  increased  and  a  little  vil- 
lage sprang  up  like  a  mushroom  and  it  became  necessary 
that  a  publick  highway  should  be  laid  out  to  accomidate 
this  new  made  village  and  petitions  were  presented  to  the 
selectmen,  requesting  them  to  lay  out  a  road,  which  they  did, 
but  the  town  would  not  accept  of  their  report.  The  Court 
of  Sessions  which  had  at  that  time  power  to  cut  roads,".  .  .

"'GOOD-BY' 

We  say  it  for  an  hour  or  for  years; 
We  say  it  smiling,  say  it  choked  with  tears; 
AVe  say  it  coldly,  say  it  with  a  kiss; 
And  yet  we  have  no  other  word  than  this — 
'Good-by.'" 


11 


We  have  no  dearer  word  for  our  heart's  friend, 
For  him  who  journeys  to  the  world's  far  end, 
And  scars  our  soul  with  going;   thus  we  say, 
As  unto  hini  who  steps  but  o'er  the  way — 
'Good-by.' 

Alike  to  those  we  love  and  those  we  hate. 
We  say  no  more  at  parting.     At  life's  gate. 
To  him  wlio  passes  out  beyond  earth's  sight. 
We  cry.  as  to  the  wanderer  for  a  night — 
'Good-by.'"  . 


When  Mr.  Sprague  first  entered  upon  public  duties  he 
was  the  youngest  man  in  his  native  town  that  took  an 
active  part  in  its  concerns,  as  he  is  now  the  oldest  citizen 
of  the  place  who  attends  the  town-meetings.  The  earliest 
occasion  on  which  his  agency  in  the  affairs  of  the  town  began 
to  be  eminently  conspicuous  occurred  in  the  year  1798, 
when  he  took  an  especial  interest  in  the  measure  of  opening 
what  is  now  the  main  thoroughfare  of  the  place, — the  road 
which  runs  near  the  shore  of  the  Bay  from  Powder  Point 
to  the  house  of  the  late  Captain  Daniel  Hall.  Indeed,  he 
and  three  other  influential  citizens  of  the  town  may  be 
said  to  have  been  the  sole  projectors  of  this  road,  for  they 
were  at  first  almost  its  only  advocates.  They  employed 
a  lawyer  at  their  own  expense  to  plead  for  it  before  the 
Court  of  Sessions,  from  which  tribunal  authority  to  lay 
out  roads  in  the  several  towns  of  the  county  was  then 
derived.  The  town,  in  its  public  capacity,  appeared,  by 
attorney,  in  opposition  to  the  measure.  Nevertheless  it  was 
finally  sanctioned  by  the  Court,  and  the  road  was  laid  out,

and  completed  in  the  course  of  two  years,  according  to  the 
wishes  of  its  friends.  But,  in  order  fully  to  carry  out  their 
design,  it  was  necessary  to  construct  a  bridge  over  Blue-fish 
River;  and  those  who  had  opposed  the  opening  of  the  road 
took  the  ground  that,  as  the  river  was  navigable  water,  the 
Court  of  Sessions  had  no  power  to  order  the  erection  of  a 
bridge  over  it.  Several  town-meetings  were  held  between 
the  years  1800  and  1803,  and  much  animated  discussion 
ensued  in  relation  to  this  subject.  It  was  contended,  fur- 
thermore, on  the  part  of  the  opposition,  that  the  cost  of 
the  bridge  would  be  very  great — three  thousand  dollars  at 
least.  To  meet  this  objection,  Mr.  Sprague,  and  his  friends 
above  referred  to,  after  privately  agreeing  to  be  joint  under- 
takers to  build  a  bridge  and  dam,  according  to  a  model 
which  they  had  prepared,  petitioned  the  selectmen  to  call 
another  town-meeting.  A  meeting  was  accordingly  soon 
after  convened;  and  when  the  arguments  of  the  opposition 
began  to  turn,  as  before,  upon  the  enormous  expense  of  the 
proposed  structure,  Mr.  Sprague  took  the  opportunity  to 
move  that  the  town  agree  to  build  the  bridge,  after  the 
model  there  exhibited,  provided  any  responsible  man  would 
undertake  the  work  for  the  sum  of  fifteen  hundred  dollars. 
The  motion  was  put  to  vote  without  debate  and  carried. 
Thereupon  one  of  the  four  who  had  made  the  agreement 
alluded  to  immediately  rose  and  accepted,  in  his  own  name, 
the  offer  of  the  town,  as  expressed  by  the  vote  just  passed. 
This  occurred  on  the  second  Monday  of  February,  1803. 
The  very  next  day  preparations  for  building  the  bridge 
were  commenced  in  good  earnest  by  the  contractor  and  his 
associates.     Some  of  the  most  persevering  in  the  ranks  of

the  opposition  threatened  to  call  still  another  meeting,  with 
a  view  to  having  the  recent  vote  reconsidered.  But  the 
undertaking  proceeded  so  rapidly,  that  before  this  threat 
could  be  executed  it  was  quite  too  late  to  think  of  re- 
tracting. In  the  course  of  a  few  months  the  bridge  was 
completed  to  the  satisfaction  of  a  committee  of  the  town* 
who  had  been  chosen  to  oversee  and  inspect  the  work  of 
its  construction.

"l.  And  it  came  to  pass  in  the  days  of  Caesar,  the  King, 
that  he  commanded  his  servant  Joshua,  saying,  get  thee 
up  a  journey  into  the  land  of  the  Hanoverites,  to  Benjamin, 
the  Scribe. 

"2.  And  say  unto  him,  I,  Caesar,  the  King,  have  sent 
forth  my  decree,  and  commanded  that  the  people  in  the 
land  of  Sodom  shall  no  longer  be  separated  from  the  Wes- 
tonites,  the  Drewites,  and  the  Cushmanites,  that  dwell  on 
the  north  side  of  the  great  river  Blue-fish. 

''3.  And  also  command  Benjamin,  the  Scribe,  that  he 
forthwith  make  out  a  petition  and  convey  it  to  the  Judges 
and  Magistrates  of  our  land,  commanding  them  that  they 
straightway  direct  the  Sodomites,  the  Westonites,  and  all 
the  other  Ites,  within  our  borders,  to  build  a  bridge  over 
the  great  River  Blue-fish. 

"4.  So  the  Judges  and  Magistrates,  fearing  Caesar,  the 
King,  and  Joshua,  his  servant,  commanded  that  the  bridge 
be^built  according  to  Caesar's  decree. 

*  This  committee  consisted  of  the  foHowing  persons:  Samuel  A. 
Frazar,  Ezra  Weston,  and  Isaiah  Alden.

''5.  But  it  came  to  pass  that  there  arose  up  certain  of 
the  tribes  of  Judah  and  Levi  and  of  Samuel,  and  of  the 
Chandlerites,  and  others  most  learned  in  the  law,  and 
showed  unto  the  Judges  and  Magistrates  that  Caesar,  the 
King,  had  done  wickedly,  in  commanding  what  was  un- 
lawful to  be  done,  and  so  by  the  voice  of  the  multitude  the 
decree  was  set  aside. 

"6.  And  it  came  to  pass  that  Caesar  and  the  Sodom- 
ites wrought  up  the  minds  of  the  people,  and  cast  such  delu- 
sions before  their  eyes  that  they  had  fear  before  Caesar, 
the  King,  and  at  length  resolved  to  build  the  bridge,  and 
connect  Caesar's  dominions  to  the  land  of  Sodom. 

"7.  And  now  behold  Caesar,  the  King,  has  erected  an 
arch  fifty  cubits  high,  on  that  bridge,  which  the  people, 
in  their  folly,  have  built — and  set  up  an  image  over  on  the 
top  of  the  arch,  and  commanded  all  the  people  from  the 
land  of  Sodom  on  the  south,  the  Westonites,  and  all  the 
other  tribes  in  the  North  to  assemble  on  the  fourth  day  of 
the  seventh  month,  and  bow  their  heads  to  the  image  which 
the  King  has  set  up. 

"8.  And  behold  the  people  assembled  according  to  the 
King's  decree,  and  did  as  he  had  commanded."

Note.  Ezra  Weston  was  one  of  the  most  energetic,  enteri^rising, 
perscsxring  and  wealthy  men  in  the  town  of  Duxbury,  Plymouth 
County,  Massachusetts;  was  the  largest  ship-builder  and  ship-owner 
in  the  country,  and  was  familiarly  known  as  King  Caesar.  He  was 
looked  up  to  as  the  leading  citizen  of  the  town.
