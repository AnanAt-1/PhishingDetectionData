  was born in 1760 the second son of the Jacobite, James Maxwell of Kirkconnell, 
  and his wife Mary Riddell. His father died when he was two, so he spent his 
  early days under the influence of his English mother. With his two brothers, 
  in August 1771 William was set to school at the Jesuit College at Dinant in 
  Flanders. There, the boys had an ally in their uncle, Father George Maxwell 
  who was one of their teachers at the college.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Dinant was a renowned school for the sons of Scotlands Jacobite houses. 
  The Catholic church was in turmoil at that time, the Pope was using his influence 
  to suppress the Jesuits and when Dinant was forced to close in 1773, the boys 
  moved to the 'Academie Anglaise' in the free principality of Liege. William 
  was a good student enjoying a natural gift for sciences and drama. He matriculated 
  in 1776 and returned to Kirkconnell were he was to spend the next eight years.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Times New Roman">At the age of nineteen he
was struck down with a mysterious illness which persisted for two years but in
1784 he enrolled at Edinburgh University to study Medicine. His natural bent for
the sciences served him well and three years later he qualified as a doctor. It
was during these years of study that William became acutely aware of the new
enlightenment that was sweeping through Europe, he easily adopted these ideals
and was later to pursue them to the point were his life was threatened.</font></p>

  two half hearted attempts to start medical practices in London and then Dumfries, 
  William set out for a grand tour of Europe, however, he got no further than 
  Paris, the flashpoint of the republican revolution. When he arrived there, the 
  great city was a hotbed of discontent. William, the idealist, found himself 
  surrounded by like minded people who were getting ready to change the world. 
  The young reformers that William befriended were to be the leaders of the revolutionary 
  forces that were to purge France of its aristocracy. At his family's pleading, 
  William returned to Scotland late in 1789. They, implored him to pursue a medical 
  practice, but young William's blood was fired, and following two more failed 
  practices he set out for London with £500 that had been left to him when his 
  younger brother died.<o:p> </o:p> </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">The 
  revolution in France was now underway and William itched to be there, but he 
  was recruited to procure arms for the revolutionary forces. He went to Birmingham 
  were he ordered 20,000 daggers, but on returning to London, found himself the 
  centre of much attention following a speech in the House of Commons by Edmund 
  Burke who had condemned him for his Jacobin sympathies and revolutionary actions. 
  Wisely, William fled London and headed back to France were he was welcomed by 
  his now powerful friends. He enlisted into the National Guard and was given 
  positions of great trust which culminated in him commanding the guard that led 
  Louis XVI to his appointment with the guillotine on the morning of 21<sup>st</sup> 
  January 1793. On the 1<sup>st</sup> February, France declared war on Great Britain, 
  with no intention of becoming a traitor to his country, William deserted his 
  comrades and headed for home, landing at Dover on the 27<sup>th</sup> February.<o:p>

  William, the great enlightenment had darkened, the past few months had seen 
  his new world ideals turned to butchery and his friends to enemies. Disillusioned, 
  he headed back to Kirkconnell. Lack of funds drove him to take up medicine again 
  this time with a little success. He built up a small practice in Dumfries were 
  he made little money, but enjoyed the acclaim of a celebrity, much to his families 
  embarrassment. Later, he moved to Edinburgh where an unidentified liason led 
  to the birth of his daughter Elisabeth who lived under his protection from a 
  very young age. It is not known when William met Robert Burns, but it is obvious 
  that the young poet held the Doctor in high regard. It was undoubtedly their 
  common support of republicanism that sealed their friendship. So strong was 
  that friendship, that the day Burns died, his new born son was named Maxwell 
  after the good Doctor.</font></span></p>

  his later years, William mellowed into a quiet, respectable man of medicine. 
  He passed away on 13<sup>th</sup> October 1834. His association with Burns and 
  with the early days of the first revolution in France, assured him of a permanent 
  place in history.</font></span> </p>

  Maxwell, Lady Glenorchay 1741-1786</font></font></p>

  Maxwell was born on 2nd September 1741, the second daughter of William Maxwell 
  of Preston and his wife Elizabeth Hairstanes, the heiress of Craig. Her father 
  died within a few weeks of her birth. He was descended from the Maxwells of 
  Carnsalloch and was said to have been possessed of a large fortune which was 
  split between his two daughters and his widow. Willielma's mother Elizabeth 
  was a an ambitious woman who determined that he daughters should both make good 
  matches. To that end she moved to Edinburgh and set up a good home in the Haymarket. 
  By 1760 there were three good matches in the small family, Elizabeth had taken 
  a second husband in the form of Lord Alva, a Senator of the College of Justice 
  Her eldest daughter Mary Maxwell married William, 15th Earl of Sutherland and 
  Willielma had just married John, Viscount Glenorchay, the eldest son and heir 
  to the Earl of Breadalbane. From their quiet modest beginnings in the farmlands 
  of south-east of Galloway these young ladies had grown up to marry into two 
  of the principal earldom of the land.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Willielma sister, Mary, bore the 
  Earl of Sutherland two daughters, but with in a year of the younger ones birth, 
  both Mary and her husband were dead from a "putrid fever" which they had contracted 
  whilst visiting the Spa at Bath in England. Only the second child survived and 
  grew up to be the Countess and later Duchess of Sutherland. Willielma was a 
  happy bride and very fond of the great wealth she married into. She liked to 
  host great balls, go to the theatre and play cards until early in the morning. 
  However after the loss of he sister in 1766, she "fell under religious impressions 
  and was converted to God". This was to have some effect on her husbands disparate 
  life but he was not long for the world and died in 1770.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This left a second great fortune 
  to Willielma. She had struck up an intimate acquaintance with the reformer John 
  Wesley and he had influenced her early religious thinking but returned to the 
  Presbyterianism in which she had been raised after disagreeing with him about 
  his Armenian doctrines. She rented a church in Edinburgh and had services conducted 
  by Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist ministers but religious bigotry was 
  rife at the time and the scheme did not work out. Willielma them bought the 
  church and settled on a Presbyterian foundation with the eventual approval of 
  the general assembly of Scotland. The church is still known as Lady Glenorchay's.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">She established a number of other 
  churches in Scotland and England all with generous endowments. She lived at 
  Barnton House to the west of Edinburgh but took charge of her father-in-laws 
  home at Taymouth Castle where she settled evangelical clergymen in the local 
  parishes. She died in 1786 at the age only 43 . She had suffered much ill health 
  but bore it with quiet identity in her pious way. She left vast legacies to 
  her foundations and churches with further sums to establish a society for Propagating 
  Christian Knowledge and further sums to be expended in evangelical work on the 
  estates of Sutherland and Breadalbane. </font></p>

  Robert Maxwell of Orchardton 1727-1786 </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="../Flags/scotlandc.gif" width="68" height="50" align="left">Robert 
  Maxwell was the only son of Sir Robert Maxwell of Orchardton was born at Orchardton 
  Tower in 1727. When he was twelve years old he was sent to the Jesuit College 
  at Douay, in Flanders. His father, who suffered from a form of religious mania, 
  handed over the running of his estates to his younger brother, enabling him 
  to concentrate on his holy devotions. He died soon after, leaving the estates 
  in trust to his son Sir Robert's brother, Thomas, determined to keep the estates 
  for himself made it known, that the heir to the title was to become, a priest 
  and had a sum of money being sent to Douay, ordering that Robert Maxwell should 
  renounce all worldly possessions and be trained in the priesthood.<br>
  Parliament duly accepted his explanation and the estates passed to Thomas along 
  with the Baronetcy. However, soon afterwards, the new laird died and was succeeded 
  by his son, who became Sir Thomas Maxwell of Orchardton. Sir Thomas, was an 
  unsavoury young man who had no intention of letting his cousin have any of his 
  rightful inheritance. Meanwhile Robert, grew suspicious and realised that he 
  was being groomed for the priesthood, so he ran away and enlisted in the French 
  army. At this time (1743) France and England were at war and there were many 
  Scots in the ranks of the French army. Robert was a keen recruit and learned 
  his trade in battle at Dettigen and Fountenoy. He was duly promoted and given 
  a commission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Robert came back to Scotland as 
  one of the French troops sent to assist Bonnie Prince Charlie. Lieutenant Robert 
  Maxwell disembarked from a French man-of-war in the Moray Firth and the young 
  mercenary led his troop of Frenchmen south to join the Jacobite army near Prestonpans 
  where he distinguish himself against the English when they were surprised and 
  beaten. After Prestonpans Lieutenant Maxwell with his troop went south to Derby 
  where ill advice caused the Prince to order his men back to Scotland. At Culloden 
  Moor they were met by the Duke of Cumberland, and were disastrously defeated. 
  Robert Maxwell was badly wounded leading a futile charge. The survivors of his 
  troop carried him from the field and into Lochaber, where they went into hiding 
  until his wounds healed. When he was recovered, he ordered his men to make their 
  way back to France, while he travel south to his home country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">He was captured in Longwood, near 
  Dumfries as a common rebel and arraigned before the Commissary of Dumfries and 
  sentenced to death as a traitor. As he was being led from the courtroom, Robert 
  took out his commission and tore it up, but was seen by John Goldie of Craigmuie, 
  the Chief Magistrate. He ordered the paper be brought to him and, piecing it 
  together, read it. When he realised what it was, he ordered that a man should 
  be held as a prisoner of war. He asked who the young man was and Robert replied, 
  "I am Robert Maxwell of Orchardton Tower, Your Honour." An elderly lady came 
  forward and identified Robert having been his nanny when he was young. She told 
  Mr Goldie that his prisoner was the rightful owner of Orchardton and how his 
  lands had been taken from him by trickery. Robert was eventually freed and sent 
  back to France to resign his Commission and collect evidence that he could against 
  his cousin. From the college at Douay he obtained evidence of his late uncle's 
  conspiracy to have him join the priesthood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 1747 he returned to Scotland, 
  renounced his religion, became a Protestant and took out a law suit against 
  his cousin claiming the lands and title of Orchardton. The Court of Session 
  found in Robert's favour, on hearing that he had lost, Sir Thomas died of apoplexy 
  The estates of Orchardton were worth £10,000 per annum and Sir Robert set about 
  building a new house at Glenshinnoch which he renamed Orchardton. He married 
  the daughter of Sir Robert MacLellan of Barscobe, and a niece of Lord Kirkcudbright. 
  Through this marriage he eventually became proprietor of Kirkcudbright Castle. 
  Sir Robert invested heavily in the Bank of Ayr which in 1773 went bankrupt and 
  most of his fortune was lost. He and his wife were forced to leave their new 
  house and live in more humble surroundings, Mrs Goldie, daughter-in-law of the 
  worthy John Goldie, describes Sir Robert as follows: "He was the ornament of 
  delight of the country, uniting all the gentlemanly dignity of the old school 
  with the bland and graceful gaiety of foreign manners". Sir Robert Maxwell died 
  in September 1786,. He had no heirs and all of his estates were eventually bought 
  by James Douglas, brother of Sir William Douglas, the founder of the town of 
  Castle Douglas. </font></p>
