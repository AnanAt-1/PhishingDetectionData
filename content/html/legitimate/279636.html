<H3><a name="Peek">PEEK</a></H3>

<P>PEEK.COM allows the user to branch in a batch file based on the
contents of any byte or subset of bits in a byte anywhere in low 
(Below 1 Megabyte) memory.  After writing over a dozen little routines to
check the status of one thing or another for various people (CAPS LOCK,
video mode, screen size, etc.) I figured that one all-purpose programme
could replace all of the special-purpose programmes.  You can now read

<H3><a name="FixClk">FIXCLOCK</a></H3>

<p>Have you ever played a computer game for a half hour and found out that
your computer clock is now three or four hours fast?  Many games change
the system timer interrupt rate to a more frequent one so they can produce
less jerky animation without it being affected by the processor speed.
Unfortunately, many of them fail to correct for the faster incrementation
rate to the software system clock and your computer clock runs like a
jaguar on speed.</P>

<p>Usually, the only fix for this is to manually change the time (which is
error prone and alters your hardware (CMOS) clock setting as well as the
software clock -- and requires you to have an accurate time source
other than your computer) or to shut the computer off and then back on so
the system will reread the hardware clock again to reset your software
system clock.</p>

<p>FIXCLOCK.COM to the rescue.  After running one of these games, just run
the FIXCLOCK programme.  It reads your hardware clock and sets the system 
software clock to match it.  No fancy parameters to memorize.  Just type
&#34;fixclock&#34; (without the quotes) and press your ENTER key.</p>

<p>The programme and instructions are available here in a single tiny
zipped file called, unimaginatively, 
<a href="fixclock.zip">fixclock.zip</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="ShTime">SHOWTIME</a></h3>

<p>A little history...</p>

<p>
Once, a few years ago, I was asked to troubleshoot a program that a friend
had typed into his computer from a magazine (as a DEBUG script to create
the program).  The program, unimaginatively, was called CLOCK.COM (as are
a dozen or more similar utilities).  Its purpose was to put the time on
the user's screen while he was working on other stuff.  Unfortunately it
had a number of problems:</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>It detected the video adapter in use at load time and set itself to
use that one.  Once loaded, there was no way for the user of a dual-video
system (with both monochrome and colour adapters) to switch the clock
to the monitor in use (or, if preferred, to the monitor not in use).
<li>Once loaded, the only way to turn it off (other than by using a TSR
manager) was to reboot the system.
<li>The clock routine had errors in the calculation that converted the
timer ticks to a time-of-day.  This meant that the time reported was
incorrect, almost correct just after midnight and drifting off more and
more the farther the time was from midnight.
<li>The clock wrote directly to the screen and caused snow on CGA
monitors.
<li>The time was at a fixed location, covering up essential information
when running some applications.
<li>The clock ignored the current video mode so, on a colour screen, the
time would be on the *second* line of the screen in 40-column mode.  If
the user switched to a graphics mode, garbage appeared on the screen
where the clock insisted on poking text characters.
<li>The clock beeped on the hour and used a software loop to time the
beep. This disabled other interrupts during the beep and interfered with
serial communications.  It especially interfered with the mouse and/or
graphical digitizer pad communications resulting in their being
disabled until the system was rebooted.
<li>If run more than once, multiple copies piled up in memory, interfering
with each other and other programs.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The magazine (no names, besides I've forgotten it) was nice enough to
include the source code for the CLOCK.COM program.  I started re-writing.
I managed to eliminate all of the objections above and then realized
something: none of the original code remained.  This warranted a new name
so I called my program "SHOWTIME.COM".
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>It detects the video adapter in use at load time and, by default, sets
itself to use that one.  If the user switches to use the other video
adapter, the clock routine switches with him.  Command-line switches
can override the default and specify which adapter to use.
<li>Once loaded, repeating the command does not install the program a
second time.  Instead, the transient copy will just process its
command-line switches and use them to update or change the settings used
by the resident copy.  Two of the switches allow turning off the display
(/N) or turning off the hourly beep (/Q).  Running the program again with
no switches sets things back to the defaults.
<li>The clock routine was rewritten to use successive 32-bit subtraction
to calculate the hour and then use 16-bit division on the remainder to
determine the minute instead of trying to use 16-bit division to
compute the hour (the cause of CLOCK.COM's error).
<li>A command-line switch (/W) was added to allow for wait-for-retrace
before writing to the colour screen.  To minimize the system slowdown this
would cause, /W also reduces the frequency of updates to the screen to one
update per ten timer ticks instead of one update per tick.
<li>By default, the time is displayed in the upper right corner of the
screen but command-line switches can specify a different location.  In
fact, you can specify one location for the monochrome screen, one for
80-column colour and one for 40-column colour.  The locations can be
changed at any time by re-running the program with new command-line switch
parameters. You can also specify the screen attributes to use to enable
it to display in underlined or high-intensity or reverse-video on a
monochrome screen or in a foreground/background colour combination of
your choice on your colour screen.
<li>The video mode is checked and no writes are made to the screen unless
that monitor is using video mode 0, 1, 2, 3, or 7 (all text modes).
There is one exception.  On initial loading, if the current video mode is
mode 7 (using the monochrome adapter) you can tell the program to write to
the colour screen anyway.  In that case, it is impossible for SHOWTIME to
know what mode the colour adapter is using so another command-line switch
can be used to specify this.  IF YOU LIE in the command-line switch,
then SHOWTIME can write to your colour screen while it is in a graphics
mode but will detect the error on the next video mode change and will
then correctly track your colour adapter mode.
<li>SHOWTIME beeps on the hour unless told otherwise but uses timer
interrupts to control the duration of the beep.  I have had the beep occur
during file downloads and even in the middle of log-in modem handshakes
with no effect on serial communications at all.
<li>Only the first copy run will stay resident in memory.  Subsequent
copies just take the opportunity to process the command-line switches and
change the settings of the single resident copy.
</ol>

<h3><a name="TinyEd">TED</a> -- A Tiny EDitor.</h3>

<p>Is your current text-editor too bloated to put on an emergency boot
disk (You <b>do</b> have an emergency boot disk, don/t you?) without
crowding everything else off the disk?  PC Magazine's Tiny EDitor to the
rescue.  Depending on the version you prefer, it's somewhere between
2984 bytes and 3412 bytes in size.</p>

<p> <!-- The Simtel download page for 
[a href="http://www.simtel.net/pub/pd/48726.html"]
PC Magazine Vol 7, No 19</a> appears to be 404 now.  For some reason,
Simtel is getting rid of their collection of PC&nbsp;Magazine utilities.
I have grabbed a copy before it disappeared from all of their mirrors and 
have archived here, on my web site, in the file 
The file, <a
href="v7n19.zip">"v7n19.zip"</a> includes source code and/or
executables for TED, PMHELLO, and PAGEDEMO.  TED.COM in that file is
2984 bytes in size.  <!-- The Garbo Archives has a file just for TED,
[a href="ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/pcmagutl/ted.zip"]ted.zip[/a] in which
TED.COM is slightly larger at 3072 bytes (but at least some of that is
zero-byte padding at the end to a sector boundary).  -->
Here's a text file with the <a href="ted.txt">TED documentation</a>.</p>

<p>For some users, TED is a bit lacking.  <a
href="tedplus.zip">tedplus.zip</a> contains one user's attempts to
address an omission in TED, the lack of a Search feature.  His modified
version of TED, TEDPLUS.COM is a bit larger at 3412 bytes.  The only <a
href="tedplus.txt">documentation</a> for his modified version is a list of
changes.  See the original for full documentation.</p>

<p>For those that need an editor for email and Usenet where wrapping and 
indicating quoted text is needed, another user modified TEDPlus to create
SuperTED.  You may want to download <a href="superted.zip">superted.zip</a>
and give his version a try.</p>

<p>I had different objectives when I patched TED.  Firstly, I was trying
to port it to a machine that wasn't IBM compatable (the Texas Instruments
Professional Computer) and thought I would address some of my additional
needs at the same time.  The additions were so handy that I patched the
IBM version to add <a href="nted.txt">the same new features</a> to the
IBM version (and fix a couple of bugs in the process).  Both the IBM
version (NTED.COM, 3237 bytes) and the Texas Instruments Professional
version (TTED.COM, 3151 bytes) are available for download in the single
zipped package, <a href="nted.zip">nted.zip</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="ChangePCM">CHANGE.COM</a> -- a search-and-replace utility
from PC Magazine.</h3>


<p>Its limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one replacement per command.
<li>Source file must not be larger than 32KB.
<ul>
<li>About 32KB to 40KB you just get no change.
<li>Over 40KB you get a "file too large" error message.
</ul>
<li>Result file can't be larger than about 40KB.
</ul>

<p>Syntax:<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHANGE&nbsp;&nbsp;filename.ext&nbsp;&nbsp;source&nbsp;&nbsp;replacement</tt><br>
where <tt>filename.ext</tt> is the name of the file to be changed,
<tt>source</tt> is the string to search for, and <tt>replacement</tt>
is the new string to substitute for <tt>source</tt>.  The <tt>source</tt>
and <tt>replacement</tt> strings may be any one of:</p>
<ol>
<li>a byte value in decimal, 0 to 255,
<li>a character string in double-quotes, or
<li>any number of the above separated by commas.
</ol>
<p>In addition, the <tt>replacement</tt> string may be two double-quotes
to indicate an empty string (in which case you will be deleting the
specified <tt>source</tt> string).<p>

<p>It's available in a zipped archive, <a href="v5n19.zip">v5n19.zip</a>
complete with source code.</p>

<p>Note: be careful.  Changes are global.  If you only intend to change
"cat" to "dog" and are careless with your specifications, the results
could be dogastrophic.</p>

<h3>Written by others and used frequently by me:<h3>

<p><a href="carve20a.zip">CARVE</a> -- cuts a file into pieces with the
size you specify.  Pieces have numeric extensions, ".001", ".002", etc.
and CARVE can also rejoin the pieces.  Limit is 999 pieces and requires
enough free space to hold all the pieces.  Can also reassemble the pieces
into the original file. Easy syntax and easy to use.</p>

<p><a href="filextrt.zip">FILEXTRT</a> -- can do the same as CARVE but
requires a separate command for each piece and you need to calculate the
file offsets and sizes for each piece.  Run it with no command-line
parameters to get the usage.  Harder to use than CARVE but more powerful
because:
<ul>
<li>The pieces can vary in size (say to fit in the spare space on some
floppies that already have data on them),
<li>there is no limit to the number of pieces (as long as you ensure a
unique name for each piece),
<li>it can be used to extract a selected part of a file when you don't
want the rest in pieces, and
<li>you only need free space for the individual selected piece being
extracted which need not be on the same drive as the original (great
for cutting a 14MB file on a 16MB RAM-disk and saving it onto floppies
one piece at a time).
</ul>
</p>

<p>PC Magazine's <a href="skippers.zip">SKIPLINE.COM</a> -- skips selected
lines in a file and others modified by me to create six more utilities
to skip selected pages, to output selected lines (for Mac end-of-line
characters or DOS or UNIX end-of-line characters) or selected or even or
odd pages.
The text file, <a href="skippers_contents.txt">skippers_contents.txt</a>
lists the contents of the zip file (which includes a DEBUG script to show
how the original was modified and a couple of demo files).</p>

<p>Just so Macintosh users don't think I exclude them because I don't like
Macs (it's because I have just never used a Mac and don't know enough
about them) below are some links related to a Macintosh program similar to
CARVE called "SplitIt!" that is recommended by a Mac user friend of
mine:<br>

<h2><a name="FFskip">FFSKIP.COM</a>:</h2>
<p>FFSKIP.COM discards output to your printer until a specified number
of form-feed characters are sent to the printer, until a software
printer reset is performed, or untill you run FFSKIP again specifying
a different count. Specifying a count of 0 or no count at all effectively
turns off FFSKIP.  Only the first copy you run will stay resident.
Running FFSKIP a second or subsequent time will just update the skip count
in the resident copy.  I wrote it ages ago when I had a printer
ribbon break in the middle of page 80 (or 90 or around there somewhere) of
a 120-page file and I later needed to print the rest of the pages without
printing the earlier ones and my only text editor at that time couldn't
handle a text file that size.  Get FFSKIP (271 bytes), and full

<H2><A NAME="Tip001">First and Most Useful Tip! (Utility)</A></H2> 
 
 <P>Get 4DOS to replace COMMAND.COM!</P> 
<P><A HREF="4d.html">4DOS</A> is a 
<strike>shareware</strike><b>free</b> replacement for COMMAND.COM that is
much better.</P> 
 
<H2><A NAME="Tip002">Second Tip:</A></H2> 
 
<P>Avoid piping from TYPE to MORE.  The command:<BR> 
<PRE> 
        <CODE>TYPE </CODE><VAR>filename.ext</VAR><CODE> | MORE</CODE> 
</PRE> 
is the same as:<BR> 
<PRE> 
        <CODE>REM &gt;%PIPE1.$$$</CODE> 
        <CODE>REM &gt;%PIPE2.$$$</CODE> 
        <CODE>TYPE </CODE><VAR>filename.ext</VAR><CODE> &gt;&gt;%PIPE1.$$$</CODE> 
        <CODE>MORE &lt;%PIPE1.$$$</CODE> 
        <CODE>DEL &gt;%PIPE1.$$$</CODE> 
        <CODE>DEL &gt;%PIPE2.$$$</CODE> 
</PRE> 
where the names <CODE>%PIPE1.$$$</CODE> and <CODE>%PIPE2.$$$</CODE> may 
vary from one DOS version to another.  (4DOS uses %P1.$$$ and %P2.$$$ 
and MS-DOS version 4.0 and higher uses random names determined by the 
current date and time.)  This means that you waste the time needed for 
TYPE to create a copy of the file to be displayed AND you risk the 
chance of the operation failing on a floppy-drive-only system (or an 
older system that always uses the current drive for pipe files) if there 
is not enough room on the current drive for the extra copy of the file 
to be displayed to go into the pipe file.  Much faster, with less chance 
of failure, is:<BR> 
<PRE> 
        <CODE>MORE &lt;</CODE><VAR>filename.ext</VAR> 
</PRE> 
Just be very careful that you do NOT type: 
<PRE> 
        <CODE>MORE &gt;</CODE><VAR>filename.ext</VAR> 
</PRE> 
as THAT can wipe out the file you want to display.  If you use 
4DOS, an even better choice is: 
<PRE> 
        <CODE>TYPE /P </CODE><VAR>filename.ext</VAR> 
</PRE> 
which combines the effect of TYPE and MORE without any redirection 
at all.</P> 

<H2><A NAME="Tip003">Third Tip:</A></H2> 
<P>Here is an interesting prompt that I worked out, one that changes shape
when you change drives.  I call it the Klingon Prompt.  Enter it into a
batch file AS ONE LINE, replacing the descriptions within &lt;&gt; with the 
characters described.  (Leave out the &lt;&gt; characters.)  Alt-219 means to 
type the number 219 on the number pad (not the number keys above the letters) 
while holding down the ALT key.  Don't release the ALT key between digits.</P> 
<PRE><CODE>
        PROMPT=$_$_&lt;space&gt;&lt;Control-_&gt;$E[2A$E[D&lt;Control-^&gt;
         $_&lt;Control-Q&gt;&lt;Alt-219&gt;&lt;Control-P&gt;$E[s$E[2D$E[$N&lt;space&gt;
         $E[u$E[B&lt;space&gt;Yes,&lt;space&gt;Master?&lt;space&gt;
</CODE>
</PRE>
<P>The prompt looks <EM>something</EM> like a little spaceship, flying down
for drive A:, flying up for drive B:, to the right for drive D:, and to 
the left for drives C:, E:, F:, or G: with the drive letter for E:, F:, 
or G: displayed.  (For older DOS versions, drives E: to G: look like 
diamonds with an empty box in the centre.)

<H2><A NAME="Tip004">Fourth Tip (Utility of mine):</A></H2> 

<p>Note: Originally I used *.DOC for documentation and *.SCR for DEBUG
scripts.  Microsoft has preempted those extensions for Word files and
screensaver files (and *.SCR files are now less likely to avoid antivirus
filters) so I have had to change the extensions used and edit the
documentation accordingly.</p>

<P>If you ever have need to send a binary file to someone whose mail 
system won't accept binary files and who does NOT have any UUDECODE 
programme on their system, you may wonder how to get the file to them.  
If they have an MS-DOS system, you are in luck.  They have a decoder that 
comes with the system.  It is called "DEBUG". (either "DEBUG.COM" or 
"DEBUG.EXE")  I have written the encoder.  It converts a binary file to 
Intel .HEX file format that is pure ASCII and DEBUG can turn it back to 
binary.</P>
<P>There is a size restriction.  My programme, MAKEHEX.COM, cannot handle 
any file larger than the legal .COM file size as I had no documentation 
on the fornmat of the .HEX file when more than one segment is used.</P>
<P>MAKEHEX.COM is now available on my web site.  (It was formerly archived
by the HAPCS (Halifax Area Personal Computer Society.)  You can 
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="makehex/makehex.txt">
view the documentation</A> for MAKEHEX 
 or
<LI>go to 
<A HREF="makehex/">
the directory</a> holding<br> <a href="makehex/files.txt">the MAKEHEX
files</A> and download them.
</UL>
</P>
<p>MAKEHEX0.COM -- at special request, I modified MAKEHEX so that it is
more suitable for creating *.HEX files for burning EPROMs.  A text file
is available that describes <a href="makehex0.txt">the differences</a>
between MAKEHEX and MAKEHEX0.  The modified file and the difference file
(in MS-DOS format) are available as a <a href="makehex0.zip">zipped
file</a> (but you need the documentation for MAKEHEX for running it).
</p>

<p>Incidentally, when I wrote MAKEHEX, it was after reverse-engineering
the *.HEX format used as an intermediate file by the MP/M-86 assembler
on my Seiko.  I have since found that

<H2><A NAME="Tip005">Fifth Tip:</A></H2> 

<P>Elizabeth Hamilton has a couple of pages of tips for the visually

</P>

<H2><A NAME="Tip006">Sixth Tip:</A></H2>

<P>For those Windows 95 users who object to having to give Microsoft free 
advertising every time they use the &quot;Flying Windows&quot; 
screen-saver but have no other one, now you can change that.  I have 
created a text file that you can 
<A HREF="fwscr.txt">
read or download</A> that describes the 
steps necessary to change the figure in the screen-saver from the 
Microsoft Windows flag to some other figure.  You only have to change ONE 
byte in the screen-saver file!  For a sample of the results, here is a 
a snip from a screen-snapshot of a modified screen saver in action:</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="Skull-3.gif"  HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 
ALT="[picture of four skulls of different sizes and colours]" 
ALIGN="center"></IMG></CENTER>
<P>Sorry, I had to get rid of the full screen shot to save disk space and
make room for other stuff.</P>
<P>Windows 3.11 users can now make the same change and optionally make the
different versions selectable in the Desktop dialog box.  Read or 
download <A HREF="ssflywin.txt">
ssflywin.txt</A> for the instructions.</P>

<p>A South African reader (who asked to be anonymous) sent me a patch
for the Windows 98 version of the screen-saver.  Read the instructions for
the other patches and then use the information in
<a href="flywin98.txt">flywin98.txt</a> to get the offset of the byte to
patch.  According to the reader, the name of the font can also be changed
as long as the new name is equal or shorter in length to the original
font name (pad with zero bytes if shorter).  [OLD] Note that I have not
been able to test this patch. [/OLD]  [NEW] I have finally been able to
check out the patch for changing the character byte and it does work.
I have not yet experimented with changing the font.[/NEW]</p>


<P> To see the entire selection of characters available in the Wingdings 
font that may be chosen for your screen-saver, those with graphical 
browsers can view the graphic file
<A HREF="wingding.gif">
wingding.gif</A> which is a screen-shot of all of the usable 
Wingdings characters in a Word document.</P>

<h2><A NAME="Tip007">Seventh Tip:</A></h2>

<P>Chebucto's own <a href="http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~aa017/Profile.html">Clive R. 
Bagley</a> has a bookmark page full of links to 
computer manufacturers from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Z&quot; at:

<H2><A NAME="Tip008">Eighth Tip (Utility):</A></H2>

<P>If you program in assembler and find all the fussing around with 
&quot;assume&quot; and LINK and EXE2BIN to get a .COM or other non-EXE 
file to be a pain, then you might want to check out the A86 assembler.  
It can assemble straight from source code to a .COM or .BIN file with no 
fussing with LINK or EXE2BIN at all (although it does have an option to 
assemble to LINKable modules if you need to).  Fast?  Assembling from a 
floppy disk, I found it to be several times faster than MASM.  Most of 
the time was reading and writing the source and object files.  Later, 
when I got a  machine with more memory, I tried timing the assembly of 
the same files from a RAM-disk.  I typed in the command to assemble with 
A86, pressed the RETURN key, and the assembly was finished before I 
could release the RETURN key.</P>

<P>You can download a trial copy of the
<a href="http://eji.com/a86/index.htm">A86 Assembler</a> from the 
author's web site along with his D86 debugger.  It is shareware so you 
can try it before you buy it.  I feel I got my money's worth from the 
registration fee I paid.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Tip009">Ninth Tip:</A></H2>

<P>If you are involved with programming and need to interface with system 
software or the system BIOS then visit Ralf Brown's site.  He maintains the 
famous "Interrupt List", an invaluable reference for any programmer. </P>

<H2><A NAME="Tip010">Tenth Tip (Utility):</A></H2>

<H3>Upgrade your HyperTerminal</H3>
<p>NOTE: HyperTerminal Personal Edition version 5.0 is now available.
Hilgraeve has moved things around on their site so, until I find the new
locations, it is possible that not all of the links below will work.
Their new HTPE FAQ *was* at:<br>

<a href="http://www.hilgraeve.com/support/faq/htpe.html">"http://www.hilgraeve.com/support/faq/htpe.html"</a>
 [moved again]<br>
but is playing hookey again.
<!--  Google has it cached, however:[br]

Customer Support Center: Product FAQs: HyperTerminal Private Edition[/a].
 -->
</p>

<P>For those <EM>Windows 95</EM> users who find it to be a pain to have to 
repeatedly press the "Dial" button in HyperTerminal or wish they could 
download large files that take a LOOOONG time to download, there's good 
news!  <a href="http://www.hilgraeve.com/">Hilgraeve</a>, who wrote the 
original HyperTerminal for Microsoft, have a free upgrade, HyperTerminal
Personal Edition (version 5) available on their web-site.  There are 
several improvements over the original version.  It includes Automatic 
Redial on Busy and Z-Modem with Crash-Recovery.  If a download is 
interrupted part-way through the transfer, you can issue the download 
command later and it will continue where it left off and not have to 
start over.</p>
<ul>
<LI>Go to Hilgraeve's HyperTerminal download page to ensure that you are
<a href="http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe/download.html">
downloading the latest HTPE</a> (HyperTerminal Private Edition) 
or go directly to
<LI>download 
<a href="ftp://ftp.hilgraeve.com/htpe/htpe5.exe">HTPE Version 5</a> or
<LI><a href="ftp://ftp.hilgraeve.com/htpe/htpe63.exe">HTPE Version 6.3</a>
directly from Hilgraeve's FTP site or
<LI>download
<a href="http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe/htpe63.exe">HTPE Version 6.3</a>

</ul>


<p>
They also have available an improved font for 
HyperTerminal (or any other application) called 
<!-- a href="ftp://www.hilgraeve.com/pub/vendor/hilgraeve/hyprfont.zip"
-->
<a href="ftp://ftp.hilgraeve.com/pub/vendor/hilgraeve/hyprfont.zip">
HyperFont</a>.  The new fonts have a character size available that 
doesn't require scrolling left and right with the mouse and scroll bar 
that clearly distinguishes the lower case el ( "l" ) from the one ( "1" ) 
and the upper case oh ( "O" ) from the zero ( "0" ) 
so you don't have to suffer with mistyped e-mail or web-site addresses 
due to being unable to distinguish the two.</P>

<P>If you need an ISO font to view accented characters correctly, see
the tail end of my <A HREF="#Tip019h">Tip Number Nineteen</A> for an
ISO Courier font that will work with HyperTerminal and a font editor
that you can use to create your own fonts.</P>


<H2><A NAME="Tip011">Eleventh Tip (Utility):</A></H2>

<P>For quite a while I found myself annoyed with one of the simplest of 
the DOS commands, the ECHO command.  What bothered me about it was:
<UL>
<LI>There was no consistant method of echoing a blank line that would
work with <EM>all</EM> versions of MS-DOS.
<LI>Except on my TI Professional, I could not echo a string with an 
escape character in it directly from the command-line.
<LI>I could not echo any message that began with "on" or "off".
<LI>While it <EM>was</EM> possible to echo <EM>most</EM> control 
characters in echo statements from batch files, not <EM>all</EM> 
character sequences were possible.  <EM>Some</EM> control sequences needed 
for my printer had to be entered into a file with DEBUG and then the 
file had to be copied to the printer.
<LI>Batch files with control characters in them could not be properly 
printed out as some codes would just not print while others would force the 
printer to do things no self-respecting printer should be expected to 
have to do.  I figured  that there should be some way to specify 
<EM>anything</EM> you want using only printable characters.
<LI><EM>Some</EM> printable characters could not be echoed as DOS treated 
them as redirection or piping symbols.
<LI>If ANSI control sequences were needed to print to the screen then 
often one screen line of text would not fit within one echo statement.  
There should have been some way to allow continuing on the same line in 
the next echo or other output statement.
<LI>For the same reason as in the item above, it was impossible to echo a 
control string to my printer without advancing the paper by one line. 
<LI>I couldn't echo text <EM>where I wanted</EM> on the screen without 
ANSI.SYS loaded.
</UL>
I got to thinking &quot;Wouldn't it be handy if ECHO accepted the same 
command strings as PROMPT does?&quot;, and then &quot;Why not write my 
own ECHO command?&quot;, and, finally, &quot;Why restrict myself to just 
those command-strings that PROMPT uses?&quot;.  So I wrote my own echo 
command I call EKKO.  It can output blank lines.  It accepts all of 
COMMAND.COM's PROMPT control strings.  It can output ANY byte value using 
only printable characters in the command line.  The CR,LF at the end of 
the command can be suppressed so the next command can continue on the 
same line.  Text can be repeated to reduce the size of a batch file. 
The date and time output by $D and $T can have the format specified by 
environment variables.  You can even get the date (month or 
day-of-the-week part of it) in ANY language supported by the PC character 
set -- you just specify the days of the week and/or the month names in 
environment variables and $D will select the right one for the current date.
Special commands provide for cursor control without ANSI.SYS or screen-dumps
on command in a batch file (except Sanyo version).  You can:
<UL>
<LI>read a text only 
<A HREF="summary.txt">summary</A> 
of the EKKO commands or 
<LI>see the 
<A HREF="contents.txt">contents</A> 
of my downloadable file for the EKKO command before you 
<LI><A HREF="ekko1p02.zip">
download the file</A> (NOW all in one zipped file).
</UL>
</P>

<h3>A handy use for my EKKO command:</h3>
<p>It was annoying to have to open each image, one at a time, in a
directory to find a picture I wanted to view or copy, especially when
the names gave no clue to the contents.  Two one-line commands (the
second, a "sort" command was only to have the images displayed in order)
typed at the command-line of a DOS box let me create an HTML file in each
directory so a double-click on it would display all of the images of one
type (.gif, .jpg, etc.) on a single web page along with the image names:
<pre>
for %f in ( *.gif ) do ekko %f$lbr$g$limg src="%f"$g$lbr$g$lbr$g$_$; &gt;&gt;all
sort &lt;all &gt;&gt;allgifs.html

</pre>
<p>which created lines such as</p>
<pre>
0103.gif&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="0103.gif"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
0104.gif&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="0104.gif"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
0107.gif&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="0107.gif"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b> My EKKO.COM should not be confused with the EKKO.EXE
program created by J. R. Stockton available on the page at:<br>
<nowrap>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/programs/00index.htm">http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/programs/00index.htm</a>"<br></nowrap>

<h3>Software:</h3>
<p>No device attached to a computer can be used if there isn't software

Journal section of the December,
2001 issue of <a href="http://www.sysadminmag.com/">
SysAdmin Magazine</a> titled "Helping the Disabled with
Perl/Tk".  You may want to visit the web site where the author of that
article describes things in much 
<a href="http://www.icogitate.com/~perl/sue/">more detail</a>.
A HeadMouse&trade; is used to enter data (with look-ahead to reduce
typing) or select from menus.  A limited demo for Windows 95/98/2k/etc. is

<H2><A NAME="Tip019">Nineteenth Tip:</A></H2>

<P>I have created a VGA font with the ISO Latin 1 character set that may
help you browse the 'net and be able to view the accented characters
properly if you use a shell account and lynx, such as on the Chebucto
Community Net.  If you download the freeware  FPMAN220 
VGA character font and color palette editor package from
the Simtel Archives at 

<a href="http://www.simtel.net/pub/pd/51833.html">
http://www.simtel.net/pub/pd/51833.html</a> (some mirrors for direct
download are:<br>

in case you can't use FTP) and my CP1252.FNT font file in zipped form
from 
<A HREF="cp1252.zip">http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/cp1252.zip</A>, 
you can then use TELIX for DOS (or some other DOS-based terminal programme)
with the Chebucto Community Net and be able to view the high accented 
characters properly.  Note that CP1252.FNT is an improvement over my
earlier font, 
<A HREF="ansichrw.zip">ANSICHRW.FNT</A> (which I will keep here in case it
is linked to somewhere).  Changes made to conform to ISO standards are:
<ul>
<li>character 128 (hex 80) is now the new ISO standard &quot;Euro&quot;
symbol (looking like a 'C' with a superimposed '=' sign).
<li>characters 139 and 155 (hex 8B and 9B) have been changed to look like
smaller versions of '&lt;' and '&gt;' instead of smaller versions of '{'
and '}' (which is how they appeared in the Windows font I used as a 
reference for them) to match the ISO standard,
<li>characters 142 and 158 (hex 8E and 9E) are now 'Z' and 'z' with a
caron (not included in the font I had used as a reference).
</ul>
</p>

<P>Use the command
<PRE>
          C:\path\VGA  FONT  C:\path\CP1252.FNT
</PRE>
(where "path" represents whatever directory you use for the VGA.COM utility 
in the font package and the directory you use for the CP1252 font) to  
load the font, either just before starting TELIX or by shelling to DOS with 
the TELIX Alt-J command and issuing the command there.  CP1252.FNT is a 
VGA font with all of the ISO defined characters 160 to 255 plus those 
Windows characters that have definitions in the range 128 to 159. 
Those characters in the 128 to 159 range for which I could find no definitions
are displayed as miniature 7-segment digit pairs 80 to 9F.  Some  Web sites 
contravene the HTML standard and use some of the Windows characters 128 to 159.
Some news-postings do that also.  The use of the Windows open single quote or 
the ISO accent accute for an apostrophe is common.</P>

<p align="center">
<img src="vga-1252.gif" 
alt="[ A screen-shot of the high characters on a VGA text display. ]">
</p>

<p>For those who can't remember what funny PC character is associated with
what control character, I have a new version of the CP1252 character set
with Control characters displaying as miniature ^c symbols and the blank
(character 160) displaying as a miniature BL.  It is available as a font
loadable as above (except for the different name, CTL1252.FNT and as a
self-loading font generated as a *.COM file with PC Magazine's font
utility.  You can get both in the zipped file <a
href="ctl1252.zip">ctl1252.zip</a>.  Just in case you want to see it
first, I have available <a href="ctl1252.gif">a picture of the font</a>.</p>

<P>You can check out all of the ISO-8859-1 high characters in my "HTML
High Characters" file at
<A HREF="htmlchars2.html">
http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/htmlchars2.html</A>
and check out some of the newer ISO characters and the cp1252 characters
at <A HREF="htmlchars-new.html">
http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/htmlchars-new.html</A>
 to see the difference the new font makes.
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="Tip019bg">Note:</A>  
there used to be bug *somewhere* in the CCN software with lynx 2.4.
(Lynx version 2.7ac as used now appears to be immune from the bug.)
When I viewed the characters with the local address (only usable when
logged on to CCN):</p>

<P><A NAME="Tip019h">HyperTerminal</A> users shouldn't feel left out.
After installing the free upgrade to <A HREF="#Tip010">HyperTerminal</A>
available from Hilgraeve, you might want to change the font to view the
ISO character set correctly.  I have finally found a font editor that
works with Windows bitmap fonts.  The editing features leave a bit to be
desired but one of its features is that you can take a Windows font and
redefine it as an OEM font.  It can then be used with HyperTerminal.  I
have tried it with one of the Windows Courier fonts and have reports that
HyperTerminal will accept it as one of its selections.  You can download
my first converted font, <A HREF="dos-cour.zip"> dos-cour.zip</A> in
zipped form, a new version (with the full ISO cp1252 Windows character
set), <A HREF="cp1252c.zip">cp1252c.zip</a> 
or you can be adventurous and download the Softy font editor,
<!-- a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/win3/font/sfty107a.zip"
 -->
<!-- a href="http://ftp2.uni-muenster.de/Win31/font/sfty107a.zip"
 -->
<a href="http://users.iclway.co.uk/l.emmett/sfty107b.zip">sfty107b.zip</a>
[NEW ADDRESS, again] and try your own conversions.  According to the
documentation, the editor can also convert TrueType fonts to bitmap fonts
so you have a lot of options to choose from.  You might find
<a href="http://users.iclway.co.uk/l.emmett/">Dave Emmett's Softy Support
Page</a> to be helpful when using it.</p>

<p>You can also get the ISO cp1252 font to display in a DOS or 4DOS box
in Windows.  Download the zipped copy of
<a href="vgaoem.zip">VGAOEMX.FON</a> and unzip it.  Rename your original
VGAOEM.FON file to preserve it (such as VGAOEM.NOF) and then rename the
VGAOEMX.FON file to VGAOEM.FON.  A screen shot of all of the characters
is below (with the right of the screen snipped off to save bytes as it is
empty).  Ignore the two different text colours.  They are a result of the
batch file used -- one colour was used for control codes and the OEM
blank character (now occupied by the '&#255;' character) and another
colour for the printable characters.
(My <A HREF="#Tip011">&quot;Super Echo&quot;</a> command was used to get the
control codes and high characters printed to the screen.)</p>

<p>Once you have the new font (DOS, HyperTerminal, or Windows Terminal
font) in use, you can check
it out with one of my ISO-8859-1 character-set tables -- for a bit of 
variety, you can use  either the old, 
<a href="htmlchars.html">original version</a>
of my character chart with numeric entities only or the 
<a href="htmlchars2.html">new, improved version</a> that also includes
entity names.  If you change your configuration to tell lynx that you are
using the  "cp1252" character set then you will also be able to view some
of the new <a href="htmlchars-new.html">Unicode character entities</a>.</p>

<P>Now I have also created a rot-13 version of the VGA font so those using
pine or lynx to read newspostings can shell out from TELIX (or whatever
else they use) to DOS, load the "ROT13.FNT" font, exit from DOS back to
TELIX (o.w.e.t.u.), and read rot-13 newspostings without having to
manually decode them.  Then shell out to DOS again and reload the ISO font
to get back to normal.  Download<a href="rot13.zip">ROT13.FNT</a> as a
ZIP file and try it out with:

          GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCF BIRE GUR YNML QBT.
</PRE>
<P>Note that the ROT-13 font is a conversion of my older ANSICHRW font and  
does not yet have the cp1252 additions and corrections.  That's coming
soon.</p>

<p>Those using Terminal that came with Windows 3.1 or HyperTerminal which
came with Windows 95 can also have their own decoder rings.  The zipped
package, <a href="rot13w.zip">rot13w.zip</a> contains two identical
Windows ROT-13-encoded Courier fonts -- one defined as an ANSI font
(I lie to Windows and tell it that it's the Windows character set) and
the other is defined as an "OEM" font (I lie again) so it's selectable by
Terminal or HyperTerminal.  If you run across a ROT-13-encoded
newsposting, just select the new font and view the post again.</p>

<H2><A NAME="Tip021">Twenty-first Tip:</A></H2>

<P>There is a serious flaw in Windows that needs to be addressed to make
Windows a serious multitasking operating system.  (Actually there are 
several flaws but don't ask me to describe them all unless you have a 
LOT of spare time on your hands.)  In my opinion, a multitasking system
should allow you to run any combination of legal programmes on your 
system as long as they don't demand more resources than are available
or require the use of the same device which can't be shared.</P>

<P>With Windows, however, there is a major flaw in how it keeps track of 
programmes already in memory that prevents you from running two legal
programmes from different directories if they have the same name.
Furthermore, you can't run a programme with a particular name if
a programme already running was originally compiled with that name
even if the name of the running programme has been changed to something 
else.</P>

<P>There are three checks you can make to test this:
<OL>
<LI>Swap the names of Solitaire and Minesweeper and try to run them 
    both at the same time.
    <OL>
      <LI>Rename WINMINE.EXE to WINMINE.XEX
      <LI>Rename SOL.EXE to WINMINE.EXE
      <LI>Rename WINMINE.XEX to SOL.EXE
    </OL>
<LI>Extract HELLO.EXE and GOODBYE.EXE from WINBUG.ZIP (available below)
    and try to run both at the same time.  Some trickery is needed to
    do so.  Figuring out what is left as an exercise for the reader.
<LI>Extract IDDWM.EXE from WINBUG.ZIP, run it, minimize it, and see the 
    results when someone else tries to run Minesweeper.
</OL>
</P>

<P>Windows 95 users will have to get Solitaire and Minesweeper to try tests
number 1 and number 3 above but they can try test number 2 without any
piracy.
</P>

<P>I have created three harmless programmes to demonstrate this bug.
You can download them in a single zipped package called
<A HREF="winbug.zip">WINBUG.ZIP</A> and check out the bug for yourself.
<br><img src="hgi.gif"
alt="&#34;Hello&#34;,&nbsp;&#34;Farewell&#34;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&#34;Sorry&#34;:">
Contents of WINBUG.ZIP:
<DL>
<DT>HELLO.EXE 
<DD>Just pops up an adjustable window with "Hello World!" in it;
compiled with the name GOODBYE.EXE and renamed to HELLO.EXE.
<DT>GOODBYE.EXE 
<DD>Just pops up an adjustable window with "Farewell cruel world!" in it;
compiled with the name HELLO.EXE and renamed to GOODBYE.EXE.
<DT>IDDWM.EXE 
<DD>Just pops up an adjustable window with "Sorry, I don't do Windows." in
it; compiled with the name WINMINE.EXE and renamed to IDDWM.EXE.
This is a great joke to play on your co-workers (or cow-orkers for those
who frequent the a.t-s.r and a.s.r newsgroups).

<p>Someone asked me if my "Flashing Cursor" logo could actually be used as
a cursor.  In response, I have created six mouse cursors for Windows 98
featuring the "flasher";
<ul>
<li>two with his coat open 
(<a href="flashingcursor.gif"><img src="flashingcursor.gif"
 alt="shown in action here"></a>),
<li>two with his coat closed 
(<a href="flashingcursor2.gif"><img src="flashingcursor2.gif"
 alt="more modestly shown here"></a>),
<li>and animated versions with him opening and closing his coat.
</ul>
The pairs of similar-type cursors differ in where the "hot spot" is for
each of the cursors in the pair.
Three have the hot spot in the middle
(shown in <a href="flashingcursor3.gif"><img src="flashingcursor3.gif"
alt="flashingcursor3.gif"></a>) and the other three have the hot
spot at the upper left corner of the flasher's head
(shown in <a href="flashingcursor4.gif"><img src="flashingcursor4.gif"
alt="flashingcursor4.gif"></a>).
The zip file also includes for your reference <a
href="flashers.zip.contents.txt">a list of
the cursors</a> and the four GIFs shown above.</p>

<p>
Grab all six, FlashingCursor.ani, FlashingCursor2.ani, 
flashingcursor3.cur, flashingcursor4.cur,
 flashingcursor5.cur and flashingcursor6.cur
in one zipped file,
<a href="flashers.zip">"flashers.zip"</a>.<p>

<p>In Windows 98, click "Start" &gt; "Control Panel" &gt; "Mouse"
and select the "Pointers" tab.  Select the item you want to change the
cursor for, click the "Browse" button and select the cursor file you want.
Click the "OK" button to save the changes.</p>

<p>According to a report from someone with Windows 2000, that version of
Windows requires you to rename one of the Windows-supplied cursor files
and rename the flasher to have the same name as the original Windows file
had in order to select it.  Here is part of his post to Usenet about it
with a word changed for clarity and a couple of typos fixed:</p>

<pre>

Here is what I did under Windows 2000 for [the] flasher.

Well, I had to actually go into the cursor file and rename the flasher
to one of the cursors already there. I took the "busy" animated cursor
and changed the .ani to xxx, renamed the flasher.ani, to the "busy",
which is handwait.ani and it works. Took several tries, and I'm going to
play with it some more. I don't remember win 98 enough, but under W2K
the cursors are all packaged in a group, so you have to rename the
flasher for it to show. At least that's the only way I got it to work.

</pre>

<p>You can also grab a copy of my Flashing Cursor logo to use as wallpaper
in the file, <a href="flasherw.zip">flasherw.zip</a> [NEW URL].  ("to use
as wallpaper" is a fancy way of saying that I have enough smarts to use
the "File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Open" menu item of a graphics program to open a
copy of my logo in GIF form and use the "File&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Save&nbsp;as..."
menu item to save it as a BMP file.)  The new file is (a) compressed
better so it's smaller and (b) now has two versions, white-on-black and 
black-on-white.</p>

<p>Another image I use as wallpaper from time to time is a blank image
except for a single line of small print:
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="i-blank.gif"
alt="This space intentionally left blank.">
</p>
<p>Feel free to use "<a
href="intentionally-blank.zip">intentionally-blank.bmp</a>" (zipped here) 
on your own PC.</p>
