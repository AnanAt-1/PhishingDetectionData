<p>The latest trailer for Universal&#8217;s <b>THE THING</b> has just crash-landed online, and you should be pleased to know that there&#8217;s some yucky alien action within! That&#8217;s right folks, you&#8217;ll get plenty of peeks at extraterrestrial mutation in this one-minute-long tease.  I&#8217;m glad to see they aren&#8217;t shying away from the bizarre. </p>
<p>The synopsis: <font color="#ff0000">Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty. It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien is unearthed by a crew of international scientists. The shape-shifting creature, accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being. It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman. In the thriller The Thing, paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they’re infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet.</font></p><div id="FreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div><div class="sponsored-content">sponsored content</div></div>
<p>The prequel, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ulrich Thomsen, Eric Christian Olsen, opens on OCTOBER 14th. Eat it up! </p>
