via snail-mail on the Michel family prior to the expulsion of the Acadians. I
have been fascinated to realize that I am FRANCOIS (DIT LA RIVIERE) MICHELï¿½ s
8<SUP>th</SUP> great-granddaughter and have worked on connections. I do realize
that there are many more family members who do not appear here, but I drew the

was born Abt. 1670 in France, and died Bef. 1755 in Pisiquit, Acadie, La Nouvelle-France
[Windsor, NS, Canada]. He married MARGUERITE MEUNIER/MIGNIER 1695 in Acadie, La
Nouvelle-France, daughter of JEAN MEUNIER and MARGUERITE HOUSSEAU. She was born
1680 in Acadie, La Nouvelle-France [NS, Canada].</P>
<P> Notes for FRANCOIS (DIT LARUINE) MICHEL:</P>
<P>The French colony of Port Royal, established in 1605, was exchanged back and
forth between France and England on a number of occasions. The first Port Royal
Acadian census was recorded in 1671. The Treaty of D'Utrecht signed in 1713, was
the "beginning of the end" for Acadian people. Francois resided with his wife
in Pisiquit Acadie and in 1714 they, with three sons and four daughters were among
346 people living along the Riviere de Pisiquit. From 1713 to 1755, the Acadian
people were forced to live under an "English regime". Although these 30 years
were years of prosperity, they were also years of incertitude. In 1744, the French,
under the command of General Duvivier, attempted to take over Acadia. Louisbourg
fell in 1745. </P>

at sea, interred in the English Channel, England. Francois-Louie was a ploughman.</P>
<P> Notes for CECILE MICHEL:</P>
<P>They lived a Riviere au Crapaud on the east bank of the River. They made a
clearing on it for the sowing of four bushels of wheat. In livestock they owned
two oxen, four cows, one calf, four pigs and ten fowls. The Fall Farm was just
to the west of the Crapaud People's Cemetery and the cemetery is on the site of
this Acadian farm. The first known British settler on this property was Christopher
Smith of Harum in Yorkshire, England.</P>
<P>Notes for FRANCOIS-LOUIS BOURC/BOURG:</P>
<P>The Acadians landed at Point Prim and were verbally granted land by the Commandant,
Monsieur Denis de Bonnaventure. They arrived in the Crapaud area about 1750. By
1758, the Cobequid settlers who came to Ile Saint-Jean through the efforts of
Lord Rollo had arrived and the Acadians were deported to France and their newly
established settlements burnt.</P>

<P> Notes for MARIE JOSEPHTE VINCENT:</P>
<P>The family moved to Ile St-Jean around 1750-52. The move took place after Paul's
death.</P>

Ile Saint Jean, La Nouvelle-France [N of Hillsborough River, PEI, Canada]. Jean
was a ploughman.</P>
<P> Notes for JEAN VINCENT:</P>
<P>Jean came to the Island in 1750. Jean had land on the Riviere du Moulin-a-scie,
situated on the south side of the Riveiere du Nord-Est of Port la Joie in 1752.
Jean is listed in the 1752 census as married to Marguerite Herbert, a native of
Acadia aged 25 and with a 2 year old son so it is unlikely that Elizabeth ever
lived on the Island. The land was granted to Jean verbally by Monsieur de Bonnaventure.
On it they made a clearing for the sowing of eight bushels of wheat. He had in
livestock two pigs and eight fowls. The property is on a piece of land between
the Johnston's and the Glenfinnan Rivers, overlooking the Hillsborough River.</P>
<P>13. vi. MARIE-MADELEINE MICHEL (DIT LA RUINE), b. Abt. 1713, Pisiquit,

NS, Canada]; d. Riviere du Moulin a Scie, Ile Saint Jean, La Nouvelle-France [Johnstons
River, PEI, Canada]; m. BERNARD SAVARY; b. 1712, Annapolis Royal, Acadie, La Nouvelle-France
[Annapolis Royal, NS, Canada]; d. Riviere du Moulin a Scie, Ile Saint Jean, La
Nouvelle-France [Johnstons River, PEI, Canada]. Bernard was a ploughman.</P>
<P> Notes for MARIE MICHEL:</P>
<P>This family came to Ile Saint-Jean about 1750 and was on a grant of land given
to them verbally by Monsieur de Bonnaventure. They made a clearing of three arpents
in extent at this location at Rivieres du Moulins-a-Scie on the south side of
the petite Ascension.</P>
<P>The Hillsborough River is typical of many PEI waterways, subject to tidal influences
up to 75% of the length of its main stream. The Acadians called it "Riviere de
Nord'Est" and "La Grand Riviere". The early colonial British named it Hillsborough
for the Earl of Hillsborough. It is also known as the East River. The French were
the first Europeans to occupy the area on a continuing basis beginning in 1720
at Port-LaJoie guarding the south of the river.</P>
<P>In 1758, at the hands of the British, most of the Island's population of 5,000
were removed from their lands, including the rich marshlands of the Hillsborough
which had attracted the experienced Acadians. The Acadian homesteads along the
River, included Port-LaJoie (Present day Fort Amherst, a point of land between
the Johnston's and Glenfinnan Rivers, present day Frenchfort, Scotchfort, Mount
Stewart, and Pisquid)</P>
<P>Notes for BERNARD SAVARY:</P>
<P> Bernard was the oldest of four surviving sons and three daughters and his
father, a widower, lived with them in Ile Saint-Jean.</P>

Canada], and died 23 Jun 1757 in La Nouvelle-France [Quebec City, QC, Canada].</P>
<P> Notes for MARIE-JOSEPHE MICHEL:</P>
<P>The family resided at Pisiquit in 1714, St-Charles-des-Mines from 1719 to 1731,
l'Anse-au-Matelot, Ile Saint-Jean in 1749 and Petit-Marais in 1752. They settled
on property granted to them verbally by Monsieur de Bonnaventure at Anse-au-Matelost.
On it they made a clearing for a garden. In livestock they had a heifer, two sows
and twenty fowls. The area they settled on in Iles Saint-Jean is now known as
Alexandra.</P>
<P>Monsieur Denis de Bonnaventure was a native of France who distinguished himself
as a soldier at Louisburg on Ile Rayale. He was appointed Commandant (Governor)
of Ile Saint-Jean in August 1749 and served until 1754. He had under his command
a garrison of 100 men. His first act was to reconstruct the principal buildings
of his garrison, including barracks, personal quarters for himself, a surgeon,
the parish priest as well as large depots for provisions and arms. The buildings
were all wood, excepting the powder magazine, which was built of stone. The building
site remained the same as was before, prior to the fort's burning by New Englanders
in 1745 during the war that was fought by the British and French from 1744-1748.</P>
<P>The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed on 18 October 1748 restoring Ile Saint-Jean
and Isle Royal to France. The area known as Acadie was also what is now mainland
Nova Scotia, remained in British hands. Assistance was provided from the Government
to all Acadians in British territory who would move to Ile Saint-Jean from Nova
Scotia and bring their livestock with them. Bonnaventure assigned the land to
the influx that arrived, on a verbal basis. Apparently he did not issue deeds.
Bonaventure was succeeded by Rousseau de Villejouin.</P>

[PEI], Canada (Vallier Field). Michel was a farmer.</P>
<P> Notes for BARBE (DIT LAURINE) MICHEL:</P>
<P>Acadians had a marked taste for homemade pastry, especially des poutines, a
type of dough based on flour or scrapped potatoes. Cut and rolled into balls,
the dough was dropped into boiling broth, where it cooked and rose to the surface.</P>
<P>Not to be overlooked were buckwheat pancakes, or plogues. They were either
thin and turned over, or raised. The latter were made with levin or yeasty residue
that was kept in a wooden bucket from meal to meal. They raised hot and light,
with many tiny holes spurting a mouth-watering steam, and were not turned over
but stacked and kept hot.</P>
<P>There was cabbage soup, wild berries (fresh in summer, jams in winter, des
grillades, du pain de buckwhit, del la tourtiere, or pork pies. The earthen cellar
floor, cool but above freezing, was covered with pumpkins, carrots, beets, turnips,
potatoes and onions. Croquecicnois, a kind of raised doughnut, made of a round
piece of dough, slashed and twisted, then fired in deep fat, was a holiday specialty
- these were called beignes in La Nouvelle-France. They were swerved with home-made
wine - either dandelion, choke cherry, beet, patte d'oie or chasspareil.</P>
<P>Before table tea could be either bought or traded for, tea was made from branches
of American larch or tamarack, steeped in hot water. Coffee was barley, roasted
in a shallow pan until brown. Beer was concocted from fir tops, soaked in a barrel
with yeast and molasses. This was fermented for a few days, when it settled, the
clear liquor that resulted was considered not bad at all. On holidays was brought
from the bottom of le grand coffre a bottle of rum, worth a week's work - but
fully appreciated by pioneers whose love of un p'tit coup has not diminished with
the generations. To drink to excess was a virer un tanante de brosse or prendre
une brosse.</P>
<P>Notes for MICHEL ULRICH:</P>
<P>The forest pressed hard upon the rough buildings of the Acadian pioneer. The
noon sun drew a golden path on a broad stretch which axes has cleared, and it
was time to enter the home for dinner. The settlers came for a simple meal. They
loved du lard, preferring it to partridge and hare. After a bowl of pea soup,
salt pork, boiled potatoes and hot tea, they filled their saucers with molasses
obtained in trade with the New England merchants, in which they soaked large pieces
of bread. They leaned back to enjoy une touche.</P>
<P>Potatoes were the staple food. The old-time woodsman method of cooking them,
sliced raw and laid on top of the stove where they sizzled and toasted, then salted
and buttered was one method of preparing them. Another method was cooking them
in hot coals, raked out black as a cinder, with the insides white an fluffy.</P>
<P>Meat was fresh game or slaughtered livestock, which could not be kept long.
In winter, some was frozen. Families arranged exchanges so that when one slaughtered,
he would return the amount borrowed from the other. When meat could not be frozen,
it was salted down in barrels of heavy brine.</P>
<P>Square tailed trout and togue were native to the waters. Togue, which was unexcelled
for chowder has entirely disappeared from eastern Canadian rivers. Salmon and
smelt were also harvested for food. Caribou and moose were plentiful but had to
be hunted with care. Deer did no appear until after the land was opened for agriculture.</P>
<P>Butter was churned by hand, the buttermilk immersed in the brook in earthenware
jugs to be used for drinking or in cooking.</P>
