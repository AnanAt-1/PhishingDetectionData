<P>
This variant of XML is based on the XML draft and documents written in it
look very similar to those written in the language of the draft. But there
are a few important differences. The goals are similar to those of XML,
but I want to stress the following:
<UL>
  <LI>
    It must be a language that can encode any hierarchical structure in a
    straightforward way.
  <LI>
    It must be human-readable itself, at least to the point that a file in this
    format can be `debugged' with a text-editor.
  <LI>
    It must be particularly suited to marking up documents that are for the most
    part human-readable text (and the marked-up document must still be
    human-readable.)
  <LI>
    When it is used for other documents (databases, knitting patterns, vector
    graphics) it should not have too much overhead, compared to formats based
    on predicate logic, S-expressions, or similar.
  <LI>
    It must have a simple grammar and lexical structure, so a parser for it can
    be written in one day. (This will allow people to write ad-hoc tools and
    throw-away applications with very little cost.)
</UL>
<P class="first">
I'm thinking of adding another goal: it must have an associated machine-readable
format for expressing restrictions to the format. This set of restrictions
(similar to the `DTD' of SGML) allows generic tools to be written that can
check the suitability of an XML file for a particular application. Maybe
this format should itself be an application of XML.
<P>
Some examples of XML files are available on <A HREF="simple-XML.html">a separate
page.</A> The program packages below also include a few test files. The data
model of XML is described in `<A HREF="Datamodel.html">the XML data model</A>.'
There are also some thoughts on transporting the contents of
<A HREF="RDB.html">databases with XML</A>.
<H2>
  Software
</H2>
<P class="first">
Here are some examples of programs that process (simple) XML. All Java software
is in <A HREF="xmllink.zip">xmllink.zip. </A> The
<A HREF="xmltest-doc/tree.html">documentation</A> is made with javadoc. The
software is in three packages: parser, tree and xptr. Included are a few
test programs:
<DL>
  <DT>
    xmlpipe
  <DD>
    Creates output similar to James Clark's nsgmls. Uses the `parser' package.
  <DT>
    xmltest
  <DD>
    Parses and builds a tree, then prints out the tree again. Uses the `parser'
    and `teee' packages.
  <DT>
    xmllink
  <DD>
    A simple program that parses an XML document, and prints all IDs, then scans
    it for xml-link="simple" and prints the elements that have that attribute.
  <DT>
    xmllink2
  <DD>
    A program that expands links with show="embed" and actuate="auto" in-place.
  <DT>
    xmlxptr
  <DD>
    Accepts an XML file and one or more xpointers on the command line, and prints
    all elements from the file that are selected by the xpointers. Uses the `parser',
    `tree' and `xptr' packages.
  <DT>
    typechk
  <DD>
    A program that performs type-checking on XML documents, according to the
    <A href="http://www.textuality.com/xml/typing.html">proposal for SQL-like
    typing</A> by Tim Bray
</DL>
<P>
The zip file contains both the source and the class files (compiled with
JDK 1.1; you'll need to recompile for JDK 1.0). If you have a CLASSPATH variable,
the zip-file can be added to it directly. For example under Unix, Bourne
shell:
<PRE>CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:xmltest.zip
java xmltest &lt;some-XML-file&gt;
java xmlpipe &lt;some-XML-file&gt;
</PRE>
<P class="first">
(If you don't have a CLASSPATH variable or the above doesn't work, you might
try unzipping the file, or ask a local guru.)
<P>
<A name="xml-in-c">A</A> <A HREF="9707/XML-in-C">Bison/Lex parser in C</A>
is also available. See the separate description. It shows a XML parser (core
syntax only, no linking, no validation) in just 13 productions and 12 tokens.
<P>
<A name="xmlbyhand" HREF="xmlbyhand.zip">xmlbyhand</A> (with
<A HREF="xmlbyhand-doc/tree.html">documentation)</A> is a (non-validating)
XML parser written in Java. It stores the parse tree in memory. The current
main program just dumps the parse tree again, in XML format. (The program
can read its own output.) The program may be useful as a `normalizer', but
the intention is really to provide some Java code that can be used in other
programs. [This program is `old', but still useful if you want to see a parser
that is not machine-generated.]
<P>
<A name="unix2coll" HREF="unix2coll.awk">unix2coll</A> is a small AWK script
that takes a Unix-style database (one record per line, fields separated by
a separator character) and outputs a "Web-collection". Web-collections will
probably use XML syntax, but the precise form is not yet decided. This is
just one of the possibilities, and probably not the best.
<P>
<A name="coll2unix" HREF="coll2unix.awk">coll2unix</A> is an AWK script that
does the opposite. It is meant to be used in a pipe after xmlpipe, and it
converts a Web-collection back into a table. Its arguments are the table
to extract (called `profile') and the field names to put into that table.
An <A HREF="example.html">example</A> shows how xmlpipe, unix2coll and coll2unix
work together.
<P class="first">
The XML parsers above are very simple. They don't validate the input, and
they don't try to resolve a reference to a DTD. They rely on the well-formedness
of the input.
<H2>
  <A name="simple-XML2">Software - take two</A>
</H2>
<P>
This is a variant of the Java-based parser above which may be more suitable
for certain kinds of XML data. It accepts the subset of XML 1.0 defined below,
and interprets certain constructs before passing the data on. The sources
are in a <A HREF="1998/03/xmlparser.zip">zip file</A>.
<UL>
  <LI>
    Newlines (CR, LF, or CRLF) are returned as tokens, separate from other content.
  <LI>
    Whitespace at the start of a line is ignored (supports pretty-printing of
    XML sources). To make a line start with a space, use an entity (&amp;#32;,
    &amp;#9;)
  <LI>
    It allows multiple elements at the top level (avoids having to enclose the
    whole document in a &lt;XML&gt; element).
  <LI>
    It supports a PI that allows to set default attribute values (lexically scoped).
  <LI>
    Parser has a method that returns the original source code in between the
    tokens, so that the original source can be written out again, if needed.
</UL>
<P>
This is the grammar (compare the file Parser.ll1 in the zip file):
<PRE>
document
  : [ NEWLINE | misc ]*
    [ doctypedecl [ NEWLINE | misc ]* ]?
    [ element [ NEWLINE | misc ]* ]+
