                <a href="typhoon.html">Operation Typhoon</a>, the German Army's final lunge to capture Moscow in 1941, was intended to
                break the Soviet Army and end its resistance to German conquest. If the operation succeeded,
                it would mean the collapse of Soviet morale (or so the Germans believed). If it failed, it would
                (and did) leave the exhausted Germans open to a Soviet counter-offensive that would push
                them forever beyond reach of Moscow.</dd>
            <dd>
                <b>Battle for Moscow</b> is a historical wargame of the German Army's struggle to defeat the Soviet
                Army and capture Moscow in 1941. It is played on a map of the territory where the battle was
                fought, and it uses playing pieces which represent the actual military units (German corps and
                Soviet armies) from the battle. The game rules duplicate the situation as it ocurred.

                    If you have never played a wargame before, the ideal way to learn is to have an experienced
                    player teach you.</dd>
            <dd>
                If you don't have an experienced player handy,
                just read the rules through once, paying particular attention to the examples.
                Be sure to follow the sequence of play exactly (it's given in
                <a href="#howtoplay"><b>How to Play</b></a> below). Refer back to the rules
                whenever you have any questions.</dd>
            <dd>
                <b>Experienced Players</b>: When teaching the game to a novice, you should play the Soviets; your
                opponent will have more fun attacking than defending. Reduce the Soviet replacements from
                five per turn to three. You might consider coaching your opponent a bit if he's about to make a
                mistake that will cost him the game, but otherwise let him play his own game.</dd>

            <b>The Counters</b> represent Soviet and German military units. Soviet units are orange/red and

            Unit <b>type</b> is either infantry (foot soldiers) or panzer (armored); only the Germans have panzers.
        <p>
            <b>Combat strength</b> measures a unit's value in battle; higher numbers are stronger.
        <p>
            <b>Movement allowance</b> determines how far the unit can move.
        <p>
            Unit <b>size</b> and <b>identification</b> are purely for historical interest and have nothing to do with play.
        <p>
            All units have two counters: a <i>full-strength</i> counter and a
            <i>half-strength</i> counter with about half the combat strength of the full-strength
            side. See the <a href="#components">counter manifest</a> above. Losses in combat can reduce a full-strength  unit to a half-strength unit.
            Replacements can turn a half-strength unit into a full-strength unit.

            <a href="#components"><b>The map</b></a> is divided into hexagons (we call them hexes

            Hexes have been numbered using an XXYY coordinate scheme. <a href="#components">The map</a>

                    Units are moved during the movement phases (phases 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the turn). Movement
                    works essentially the same way in each phase. Each unit has a <b>movement allowance</b>, which
                    represents the distance in hexes it can move in one phase. (Exception: a forest hex counts as
                    two hexes for movement.) In a phase, the player moves any or all of his units that qualify (only
                    panzers in the panzer movement phase; only Soviet units on rail lines in the railmove ment
                    phase). Units move one at a time, from hex to hex, in any direction.
        <p>
            <b>Rail Movement</b>: In the rail movement phase, any Soviet units which start the phase on a rail
            line may move. They must move only along the rail line. A forest hex counts as only one hex for
            movement in this phase.
        <p>
            <b>Restrictions</b>: A unit can never enter a hex containing an enemy unit.
            A unit can enter a hex containing a friendly unit, but there can only be one unit in a hex at the
            end of the phase.

            The above example shows different ways the Soviet 5th Army could move. The numbers show the
            number of hexes it has moved. With a movement allowance of four, the unit can move four
            hexes, as in path A. In path B the third hex the unit enters is a forest hex, which counts as two
            hexes moved, and the unit must stop. In path C the unit enters an enemy zone of control in its
            first hex and must stop. In path D the unit enters an enemy zone of control in its second hex
            and must stop. In path E, the unit ends its move ment in an enemy zone of control in its fourth
            hex and must stop because its move ment allowance is used up. Path F is not possible: the unit
            would have to move 5 hexes (counting 2 for the forest hex).

                    In each combat phase (phases 3 and 7), units may attack adjacent enemy units. First, the
                    <b>attacking player</b> (the German in the German combat phase, the Soviet in the Soviet combat
                    phase) announces all his battles: which enemy units he will attack and which of his units will
                    attack them. A battle is an attack on one enemy unit by any or all the attacking player's units
                    which are adjacent to it. A single unit may only attack once per phase, and a single enemy unit
                    may only be attacked once per phase. Once battles have been announced, the attacking player
                    can't change his mind.
        <p>
            Battles are resolved one at a time in any order the attacking player wants. For each
            battle this sequence is followed:-
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Total the combat strengths of all the attacking units
                <li>
                    Divide this total by the combat strength of the defending unit, dropping all fractions,
                    to get one of the odds levels given on the combat results table. For example, a strength
                    of 16 attacking 4 is 4:1 (four to one), while 15 attacking 4 is only 3:1.
                <li>Determine if the effects of terrain have reduced the odds
                <li>
                    Roll one die and consult the combat results table; cross-index the number rolled
                    with the odds to determine the result.
                <li>Apply the result immediately.
                <li>
                    If the attacked unit is no longer in the hex (eliminated or forced to retreat), one of the
                    attacking units may immediately move into the hex.
                <li>Go no to the next battle.
            </ol>
        <p>
            <b>Maximum and Minimum Odds</b>: In step 2, if the odds are above 6:1, reduce them to 6:1. After
            step 3, if the odds are below 1 :1 the attack has no effect on either side.
        <p>
            <b>Terrain Effects</b>: If the defending unit is in a forest hex, is in Moscow, or is a Soviet unit in a
            fortification, reduce the odds by one level (4:1 becomes 3:1, 3:1 becomes 2:1, and so on). If all
            the attacking units are across a river from the defending unit, reduce the odds by one level. (If
            both these conditions apply, reduce the odds by two levels.)

            unit must end up two hexes away from its starting hex and may not enter an enemy zone of

            unit also must end its retreat in a hex not already occupied by a friendly unit, and must retreat

            units. In both cases, if a full-strength unit is reduced to half-strength, the amount of the loss is the
            original strength minus the the reduced strength. For example, if a panzer with a strength of 9 takes
            a loss (and is replaced by its strength-4 counter), the loss is 5. Finally, the defending unit, if it survives,
            must retreat as for <a href="#DR"><b>DR</b></a> above. (Note that the defending unit may be eliminated
            in its retreat, but the attacking player is not required to match this loss).

                    The example below shows two possible attacks on a Soviet unit. In the first attack the odds
                    begin at 15 to 4, or 3:1 . They are reduced one level for the river and one for the defending
                    unit's fortifications, for a final level of 1:1.
        <p>
            The second attack is just like the first except for the addition of a strength-2 German infantry
            unit, but that makes a big difference. The odds are now 17 to 4, or 4:1; they are still reduced
            one level for fortifications, but no longer for the river, making the final odds 3:1; finally, the
            Soviet unit would be eliminated if forced to retreat, since it is surrounded by enemy zones of
            control.

                    Turns 3 and 4 are <b>mud</b> turns. All movement except Soviet rail movement is reduced to l hex per
                    phase; rail movement is unaffected. All units' combat strengths are halved when attacking (not
                    when defending). For example, in the second example of combat, above, the three German
                    units would be reduced to a total combat strength of 81/2, making the odds 2:1 (before terrain
                    effects). The attacker's losses in an exchange are based on printed strength, not halved
                    strength.

                    This unit may not begin on the map and may not be taken as a replacement until turn 4 (Nov

                <dd>
                    A replacement is the ability to create a new half-strength unit (using one which was previously
                    eliminated), or to flip an existing half-strength unit to full strength. Both players get replacements
                    each turn, each in their respective replacement phases (phases 1 and 5). The German player
                    gets one replacement, and the Soviet player gets five.
        <p>
            You can't use two replacements at once to create a new full-strength unit. Creating a new
            full-strength unit from nothing would take two turns of replacements.
        <p>
            New Soviet units appear on the east edge of the map (in any empty hex) or in any empty,
            friendly-owned city in communication with the east edge (at most one per city). Existing Soviet
            units, to be restored, must also be in communication with the east edge. <b>Friendly-owned</b>
            means that your units were the last units in the city; all cities are owned by the Soviets at the
            beginning of the game except for those that start occupied by a German unit. <b>In communication</b>
            means being able to trace a path of any length, without entering a hex containing an
            enemy unit or enemy zone of control, to the east edge of the map. Exception: the Soviets can
            bring in or restore a unit in Moscow even if it isn't in communication.
        <p>
            German replacements work the same way, except that communication is traced to the west
            edge and Moscow has no special properties .
        <p>
            If replacements are not used, they may <b>not</b> be saved for later turns.
        <p>
            <b>Game Balance</b>: If a handicap is needed for players of unequal experience, change the
            replacements. To benefit the Germans, change the Soviet replacements to four or even three.
            To benefit the Soviets, give the Germans their replacement only on turns 2, 4, and 6.

                    Set up one Soviet unit on each hex marked with a hammer and sickle, all at half strength. Don't use the 1st
                    Shock Army (the Soviet army with a combat strength of 10); it comes later. Since all Soviet units
                    are the same, it doesn't matter which unit goes where. You should have four units left over
                    (counting the 1st Shock Army); all except the 1st Shock Army can be used as replacements in
                    the Soviet player's turn.
        <p>
            The German player should then set up one German unit on each black cross, all at full strength.
            The exact setup is important since it helps to determine what the German can do on turn 1.
        <p>
            After setting up the game, the German player begins his panzer movement phase. Since all
            German units begin the game at full strength, the German player receives no replacements on
            turn 1 and skips his replacement phase.

                    Battle for Moscow was designed by Frank Chadwick (he proposed the basic game idea,
                    researched the information, and wrote the game rules). The game was developed by John
                    Harshman and John Astell (they tested, polished, and edited the rules into their final form).
                    Playtesting was performed by members of the staff of Game Designers' Workshop and Diverse
                    Talents Incorporated (they played the game before publication and pointed out flaws and problems
                    that needed to be fixed). Barbie Pratt was art director (she organized the components into
                    a final product).
