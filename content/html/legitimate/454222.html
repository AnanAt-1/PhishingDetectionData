In Loyola's Mission Statement, the School is described as providing a university-preparatory program consisting of a rigorous and comprehensive educational experience intertwined with spiritual and religious formation, and extra-curricular involvement to deserving students.<br />

An important feature of the School is its practice that no student attending Loyola should be deprived of the opportunity to get the full "Loyola experience" because of an inability to pay. This has fostered a diverse student body which has contributed to the School's strong sense of community and public service.<br />
<H2>History</H2>
Founded in 1896, Loyola High School started life as <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("47593",this,"loyola_college_(montreal).gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("47593")' href="/topics/Loyola_College_(Montreal)">Loyola College</a><span class="hp" id="m47593"><div class="hpHeader">Loyola College (Montreal)</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i47593"></div>Loyola College was a Jesuit college in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

In 1964, the Loyola High School Corporation was established to run the School separately from the College. When <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("95708",this,"loyola_college_(montreal).gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("95708")' href="/topics/Loyola_College_(Montreal)">Loyola College</a><span class="hp" id="m95708"><div class="hpHeader">Loyola College (Montreal)</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i95708"></div>Loyola College was a Jesuit college in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

To this day, Loyola has remained true to the Jesuit commitment of educating "Men for Others" who are intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving, and committed to doing justice.<br />
<H2>School buildings</H2>
Loyola was originally located in an abandoned Sacred Heart Convent on Bleury and St. Catherine Street. A fire broke out at this location in 1898 provoking the College to move into the former Tucker School on Drummond Street. That very summer, a wing was added; but space soon became inadequate. In 1900, the Jesuits purchased the Decary Farm in <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("19766",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("19766")' href="/topics/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce</a><span class="hp" id="m19766"><div class="hpHeader">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce</div><div class="hpContent">Notre-Dame-de-Grâce , also nicknamed NDG, is a residential neighbourhood of Montreal located in the city's west-end.

<br />
In 1916, <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("67880",this,"loyola_college_(montreal).gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("67880")' href="/topics/Loyola_College_(Montreal)">Loyola College</a><span class="hp" id="m67880"><div class="hpHeader">Loyola College (Montreal)</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i67880"></div>Loyola College was a Jesuit college in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The High School was located in the Junior Building and, until 1961, shared the Administration Building and then the north half of the Central Building. It was the Junior Building, which was designed in the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("17252",this,"gothic_revival_architecture.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("17252")' href="/topics/Gothic_Revival_architecture">Collegiate Gothic</a><span class="hp" id="m17252"><div class="hpHeader">Gothic Revival architecture</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i17252"></div>The Gothic Revival  is an architectural movement that began in the 1740s in England...</div><br></span>&nbsp;architectural style and covered in gargoyles, leaded and stained-glass windows and oak moulding, where young men began their journey to become "Eight Year Men." After four years of High School and four years of College, they graduated with university degrees in Arts or Sciences.<br />
<br />
In 1961, the era of boarders ended and the High School moved exclusively to the Junior Building. An extension was added in 1968 and a gymnasium was built south of Sherbrooke Street in 1978. In 1988 a decision was reached to erect a new building in order to properly accommodate the student body and to enable the School to offer the curriculum outlined by the Ministry of Education.<br />
<br />
Loyola considered a number of possible options for the future building including adding an extension onto the Junior Building, to relocating the School to <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("91937",this,"cte_saint-luc,_quebec.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("91937")' href="/topics/Côte_Saint-Luc,_Quebec">Côte Saint-Luc</a><span class="hp" id="m91937"><div class="hpHeader">Côte Saint-Luc, Quebec</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i91937"></div>Côte Saint-Luc is a mostly residential city in Quebec, Canada, located on the Island of Montreal.

The School eventually made arrangements with Concordia University&nbsp;to swap the Junior Building for a site on the south-west end of Loyola campus beside the School gymnasium. The new building was completed in 1992. The Bishops Atrium and a three-story wing was constructed in 2004, along with an auditorium the following year.<br />
<H2>Academic</H2>
Loyola High School encourages each student to "strive for academic excellence and to pursue his intellectual development to the full measure of his personal talents". Loyola stresses that academic excellence involves much more than receiving satisfactory grades on a challenging curriculum. Loyola's commitment is to promote active, life-long learning and to challenge its students to "go beyond the mastery of the basic skills, to encourage creativity, to cultivate the faculty of imagination, and to guide students to function as inquiries and problem-solvers through analysis, synthesis and evaluation." Loyola leads students to explore the "harmony and inter-relations among diverse intellectual and academic discipline, and to develop an active concern for, and awareness of, social developments in their lives in Quebec, in Canada and in the world."<br />
<H2>Spiritual and religious formation</H2>
Loyola, as a Jesuit school, interprets education in larger than academic terms—namely that full growth of the human person which leads both to reflection and to action, suffused with the spirit and presence of Jesus Christ, the Man-for-Others. Because students of high school age are at a critical stage in their religious development, Loyola aims to help them: Explore their religious experiences in an environment where Catholic doctrine and values are understood, cherished and fostered; Form sound moral judgement and a firm will to act according to it; and; Develop a fraternal respect for people of differing creeds and cultures.<br />
<br />
As a Jesuit school, Loyola must reflect the special charisms and emphases that flow from the long tradition of spirituality and thought as expressed in the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius, and other documents of the Society of Jesus, and, concomitantly, the spirituality of the lay vocation of the ministry of teaching.<br />
<br />
Therefore, the school strives to develop a special sense of community and commitment beginning with a greater dedication to the service of the church and of all people, an exciting search for a deeper devotion to Jesus Christ, and a stronger awareness that God dwells in all Creation. The school, therefore, must be clearly Christian in all its aspects. This means that the school not only exercise the natural virtues, but also build into the fabric of the school a realistic Christian ethos, which for Jesuit institutions signifies the service of faith and the promotion of justice.<br />
<br />
Since justice is a virtue central to Christian life, Loyola places special emphasis on making its members sensitive to justice both for individuals and in local, national and international situations. No person should graduate from Loyola without an awareness of the realities of global interdependence, the need for restraint in the use of natural resources, the obligation of the developed nations towards underdeveloped peoples, and the systematic forms of injustice and discrimination which currently affect Canadian and worldwide society. Loyola students and graduates are challenged to use their talents and energies to address these problems in a Christian way.<br />
<H3>Community service</H3>
<b>CSP (Christian Service Program)</b><br />
<br />
Loyola, in an attempt to be faithful to its Christian and Jesuit heritage, gives its students an experience of the value of service to their fellow man in the name of Jesus. In the course of their high school years, students participate in some form of supervised program known as "CSP" involving service to others. It is understood that enrollment in the school is a commitment to an exploration of the human and religious significance of Christian service. The objective of Jesuit education is to encourage students to be Open to Growth, Intellectually Competent, Religious, Loving, and Committed to Doing Justice.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, CSP is a compulsory program for all students. CSP project opportunities are already approved by the school. Alternatively, the students may find their own project around their area, subject to approval by the school deacon. CSP is broken down into two categories: CSP (1) for students in grades 7 - 10  and CSP (2) for students in grade 11.<br />
<br />
<b>CSP (1):</b><br />
<br />
Students must complete a certain amount of community service hours a term (the school year is split into two terms, September to December and January to June) to pass the religion course and the academic year. (Example: Grade 7: 2 hours a term; Grade 8: 4 hours a term; Grade 9: 6 hours a term; Grade 10: 8 hours a term)<br />
<br />
<b>CSP (2):</b><br />
<br />
The period of service is for 2 hours a week over the course of 12 weeks (total: 24 hours) during either their first or second term.<br />
<H2>Athletics</H2>
Loyola boasts a number of athletic teams in competition with other schools. Loyola's traditional rivals in athletics are <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("90681",this,"lower_canada_college.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("90681")' href="/topics/Lower_Canada_College">Lower Canada College</a><span class="hp" id="m90681"><div class="hpHeader">Lower Canada College</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i90681"></div>Lower Canada College  of Montreal is an elementary and secondary level private school.The college was founded by the Church of St John the Evangelist in 1861 as St. John's School and changed its name to Lower Canada College in 1909, replacing an older school by that name that was founded in...</div><br></span>&nbsp;and <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("40053",this,"selwyn_house_school.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("40053")' href="/topics/Selwyn_House_School">Selwyn House School</a><span class="hp" id="m40053"><div class="hpHeader">Selwyn House School</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i40053"></div>Selwyn House School  is a private independent boys' school located in Westmount, Quebec.

<H3>Ed Meagher Winter Sports Tournament</H3>
The most notable sports tournament that takes place at Loyola is the <b>Ed Meagher Winter Sports Tournament</b>. Originally named the "Invitational Winter Sports Tournament", the tournament was renamed after its co-founder Ed Meagher in 1996 (the year of his passing), who was a former student, teacher, and sports coach at Loyola High School. It happens annually every winter since 1971. Senior hockey (now Juvenile) was the original sport in 1971. In 1974, Senior basketball (now Juvenile) was added to the tournament, followed by Bantam hockey in 1981. Midget basketball was added in 1982. Wrestling was added in 1995. Bantam basketball was added in 1998, Pee-Wee hockey in 2003 followed by Pee-Wee basketball in 2006. In 2000, the Concordia University&nbsp;Arena (the arena used for all Loyola hockey home games and tournaments) was rightfully named the Ed Meagher Arena.<br />
<H3>JUG</H3>
<b>Jug</b>, let it be clearly understood from the start, is and always has been the heartless core of the penal system at Loyola. The student's Calendar used to state under Wednesdays and Saturdays: "Half-holidays"; but that was a printer's error. They were Jug-days. The insubordinate and the impudent, the laggards and the dullards, the brash and the brazen, the buffoons, of course, and sometimes the blackguards, all followed their wayward paths to end up in Jug. In short, you met your best friends there, on Wednesdays and especially Saturdays. You did nothing in Jug. You did time. Occasionally the rule was broken:<br />
"Copy out pages 656 to 681 of Morceaux Choisis."<br />
"Shall we omit the footnotes and the small print, Father?"<br />
"No, no. Copy out everything, everything that is there, footnotes and all, just as it is."<br />
"Yes Father. Thank you very, very much, Father."<br />
<br />
Usually, time in Jug was endured and minutely consumed by the brooding process of meditation - meditations on certain stone-hearted people, for example, who had so hopelessly misunderstood the true Ignatian spirit; meditations on the weather, on a broken finger-nail, on an ink spot on the ceiling, but mostly sullen meditations on a Prefect of Discipline who explained his Jug list with the repartee for a sergeant-major: "But what am I in for?" "You're in for two hours, m'boy."<br />
<br />
The unwritten Code of Honour at Loyola is that nothing good may ever be written about Jug, prefects or other penal appliances. Jug is rotten. So be it too for jottings in Jug.<br />
<br />
But these statements are irrelevant in today's school as Jug has transformed into a form of office detention. It is served for one hour after school as with many other detentions. There are different types of Jug: Academic, Teacher, Procedural and Office. The seriousness of the offence will determine the seriousness of the punishment.<br />
