  <A NAME="abstract"></A>Abstract
</H2>
<P>
This paper outlines &nbsp;possible areas of cooperation between the WAP Forum
and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
<P>
The WAP Forum is dedicated to enabling advanced services and applications
on mobile wireless devices, such as cellular telephones. The W3C is dedicated
to leading and advancing the development of the World Wide Web. This document
describes the problem area of mobile access to information on the web, which
is common to the two groups.
<P>
While the WAP Forum and the W3C have different organizational goals, we share
goals for the future of the global information space. We also want to avoid
unnecessary divergence between the recommendations and standards of the two
organizations.
<P>
Direct overlaps in future development occur in the areas of intelligent proxies
and protocol design; of XML applications; and in content adaption, e.g through
the use of vector graphics and style sheets. Instead of developing diverging
sets of solutions, it is the intent of both groups to find common solutions.
<H2>
  <A NAME="introduction"></A>1.0 Introduction
</H2>
<H3>
  <A NAME="W3C_Background"></A>1.1 W3C Background
</H3>
<P>
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee,
the inventor of the World Wide Web. The web had then outgrown the European
Centre for Nuclear Physics Research, CERN, where the web was developed.
<P>
From the beginning, Tim Berners-Lee has been the director of the consortium,
and has been firmly committed to developing a neutral, open forum for the
evolution of web technology.
<P>
Today, the W3C has three locations (at MIT in the USA; at INRIA in France;
and at Keio University in Japan). The consortium has more than 270 members
from industry and academia, and provides a vendor-neutral forum for its members
to address web-related issues. Working with its staff and the global web
community, the consortium aims to produce free, interoperable specifications;
like its partner standards body, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
the W3C is committed to backing its specifications by sample code. Funding
from membership dues, public research funds, and external contracts underwrite
these efforts. The work in the W3C follow a well-documented process, continuously
involving representatives of the member companies in its efforts. More
information can be found at <A HREF="https://www.w3.org">the consortium web
site</A>.
<P>
In the autumn of 1997, it became evident that there was a considerable interest
among the members of the W3C for access to the web via mobile and wireless
devices. This area appeared to entail several aspects which constrained the
usage in manners not considered in the current recommendations.
<P>
A <A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Mobile/1998/Workshop/">workshop on mobile web
access</A> was organised in April of 1998 in Tokyo to address these topics,
leading to the formation of a
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Mobile/Group/IG/">mobile access interest group</A>
that is chartered with the investigation of the impact of mobile access on
the specifications and recommendations of the W3C.
<P>
Simultaneously, the W3C was approached by the WAP Forum, and a meeting was
set up in June 1998. The results were very positive, and the meeting decided
to create this joint white paper, outlining areas of potential cooperation
between the two groups.
<H3>
  <A NAME="WAP_Forum_Background"></A>1.2 WAP Forum Background
</H3>
<P>
The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Forum is an industry group dedicated
to the goal of enabling sophisticated telephony and information services
on hand-held wireless devices such as mobile telephones, pagers, personal
digital assistants (PDAs) and other wireless terminals. Recognizing the value
and utility of the World Wide Web architecture, the WAP Forum has chosen
to align certain components of its technology very tightly with the Internet
and the WWW. The WAP specifications extend and leverage mobile networking
technologies (such as digital data networking standards) and Internet
technologies (such as IP, HTTP, XML, URLs, scripting and other content formats).
<P>
The WAP specification initiative began in June 1997 and the WAP Forum was
founded in December 1997. The WAP Forum has drafted a global wireless protocol
specification for all wireless networks and will contribute it to appropriate
industry and standards bodies. WAP will enable manufacturers, network operators,
content providers and application developers to offer compatible products
and secure services on all devices and networks, resulting in greater economies
of scale and universal access to information. WAP Forum membership is open
to all industry participants.
<P>
The objectives of the WAP Forum are:
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>
    To bring Internet content and advanced data services to digital cellular
    phones and other wireless terminals.
  <DT>
  <DD>
    To create a global wireless protocol specification that will work across
    different wireless network technologies.
  <DT>
  <DD>
    To enable the creation of content and applications that scale across a very
    wide range of wireless bearer networks and wireless device types.
  <DT>
  <DD>
    To embrace and extend existing standards and technology wherever appropriate.
</DL>
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.wapforum.org">the Wap Forum Web server</A>.
<P>
In keeping with its goals, the WAP Forum approached the W3C regarding
collaboration in the area of WWW technologies in the wireless area.

</DL>
<H2>
  <A NAME="The_Technical_Problem"></A>3. The Technical Problem: Wireless System
  Requirements on Information Retrieval
</H2>
<P>
Providing Internet and WWW services on a wireless data network presents many
challenges. Most of the technology developed for the Internet has been designed
for desktop and larger computers supporting medium to high bandwidth connectivity
over generally reliable data networks.
<P>
Mass-market, hand-held wireless devices present a more constrained computing
environment compared to desktop computers. Because of fundamental limitations
of power and form factor, mass-market handheld devices tend to have:
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Less powerful CPUs
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Less memory (ROM and RAM)
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Restricted power consumption
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Smaller displays
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Different input devices (e.g., a phone keypad, voice input, etc.)
</DL>
<P>
Similarly, wireless data networks present a more constrained communication
environment compared to wired networks. Because of fundamental limitations
of power, available spectrum, and mobility, wireless data networks tend to
have:
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Less bandwidth than traditional networks
  <DT>
  <DD>
    More latency than traditional networks
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Less connection stability than other network technologies
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Less predictable availability
</DL>
<P>
Mobile networks are growing in complexity and the cost of providing new
value-added services to wireless users is increasing. In order to meet the
requirements of mobile network operators, solutions must be:
<DL>
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Interoperable &#150; terminals from different manufacturers communicate with
    services in the mobile network.
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Scalable &#150; mobile network operators are able to scale services to customer
    needs.
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Efficient &#150; provides quality of service suited to the behaviour and
    characteristics of the mobile network; provide for maximum users for a given
    network configuration
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Reliable &#150; provides a consistent and predictable platform for deploying
    services.
  <DT>
  <DD>
    Secure &#150; enables services to be extended over potentially unprotected
    mobile networks while still preserving the integrity of user data; protects
    the devices and services from security problems such as denial of service.
</DL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="Bearer_Limitations"></A>3.1 Bearer Limitations
</H3>
<P>
Wireless network bearers operate under several fundamental constraints, which
place restrictions on the type of protocols and applications offered over
the network:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Power consumption.</B>
  <DD>
    As bandwidth increases, power consumption increases. In a mobile device,
    this reduces battery life.
  <DT>
    <B>Cellular network economics.</B>
  <DD>
    Mobile networks are typically based on a cellular architecture. Cells are
    a resource shared by all mobile terminals in a geographic area, and typically
    have a fixed amount of bandwidth to be shared among all users. This
    characteristic rewards efficient use of bandwidth, as a means of reducing
    the overall cost of the network infrastructure.
  <DT>
    <B>Latency.</B>
  <DD>
    The mobile wireless environment is characterized by a very wide range of
    network latency, ranging from sub-second round-trip communication time up
    to many tens of seconds. In addition, network latency can be highly variable,
    depending on the current radio transmission characteristics (e.g., in a tunnel
    or off network) and the network loading in a particular area. Latency is
    further increased by routing, error correction and congestion-avoidance
    characteristics of a particular network.
  <DT>
    <B>Bandwidth</B>.
  <DD>
    The mobile wireless environment is characterized by a very wide range of
    network characteristics, and typically has far less bandwidth available than
    a wireline environment. In addition, the economics of the wireless environment
    encourage the conservation of bandwidth to achieve greater density of
    subscribers.
</DL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="Device_Limitations"></A>3.2 Device Limitations
</H3>
<P>
Wireless devices operate under a set of physical limitations, imposed by
their mobility and form factor:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Limited power.</B>
  <DD>
    Any personal, or "hand held" mobile device will have a very limited power
    reserve, due to existing battery technology. This reduces available computational
    resources, transmission bandwidth, etc.
  <DT>
    <B>Size:</B>
  <DD>
    many mobile wireless are very small (hand-held).
</DL>
<P>
Mobile wireless devices are characterized by a different set of user interface
constraints than a personal computer. To enable a consistent application
programming model, a very wide range of content scalability is required.
In practice, a significant amount of the current WWW content is unsuitable
for use on hand-held wireless devices. Problems include:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Output scalability.</B>
  <DD>
    &nbsp;Existing content is designed for viewing on PC screens, whereas mobile
    devices will have a wide range of visual display sizes, formatting and other
    characteristics. In the near future, this will include voice-only output.
  <DT>
    <B>Input scalability.</B>
  <DD>
    Mobile devices feature a wide range of input models, including numeric keypad,
    very few or no programmable soft keys, etc.&nbsp;In the near future, this
    will include voice-only input.
</DL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="Use_Case_Limitations"></A>3.3 Use Case Limitations
</H3>
<P>
Many wireless devices, for example cellular phones and pagers, are consumer
devices. These devices are used in a wide variety of environments and under
a wide range of use scenarios. For example:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Simple user interfaces:</B>
  <DD>
    many mobile devices, in particular, cellular telephones, are mass-market
    consumer-oriented devices. Their user interface must be extremely simple
    and easy to use.
  <DT>
    <B>Single-purpose devices:</B>
  <DD>
    the goal and purpose of most mobile devices is very focused (e.g., voice
    communication). This is in contrast with the general-purpose tool-oriented
    nature of a personal computer. This motivates a very specific set of use
    cases, with very simple and focused behavior. For example, "place a voice
    call" or "find the nearest ATM."
  <DT>
    <B>Hands-free, "heads-up" operation:</B>
  <DD>
    many mobile devices are used in environments where the user should not be
    unnecessarily distracted (e.g., driving and talking).
</DL>
<H2>
  <A NAME="Future_Development_from_the_W3C"></A>4. Future Development from
  the W3C in this Field
</H2>
<P>
The World Wide Web Consortium has as its motto "Leading the Web to its full
potential", which means leading and participating in the continuing development
of the Web and its standards. The new generation of Web technologies that
is currently being specified by the W3C is intended to enhance the users'
and publishers' control over the presentation of the information (e.g. through
CSS), over the management of information (e.g. through RDF), and over its
distribution (e.g. through P3P); based on technologies that structure and
distribute data as objects, such as XML and HTTP-NG. Several areas will impact
the use of &nbsp;technologies developed by the W3C in mobile environments.
<P>
The work of the W3C in this field is initiated and maintained through its
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Mobile/IG-charter#ExternalGroup">Mobile Access
Interest Group</A>. Work which touches on the mobility of the user access
devices is conducted in several areas, however. Specifically, the Mobile
Access Interest Group is reviewing the HTML 4.0 specification for mobile
aspects; investigating how user agent profile information can be managed
within the W3C technology framework; and investigating position dependent
information services. Due to the scope of mobile access, all areas of the
W3C might concievably be involved in the future. Below, we point to some
of those where mobile access may have an immediate impact.
<H3>
  <A NAME="XML_and_the_next_generation_of_HTML"></A>4.1 XML and the next generation
  of HTML
</H3>
<P>
The W3C has recently decided to initiate an activity to create a new generation
of HTML. This will be based on XML, and is likely to include features that
makes it more efficient for mobile use.
<P>
Meanwhile, other XML applications such as the Wireless Markup Language, WML,
and the Synchronised Multimedia, SMIL, will continue to appear. These are
likely to have components where mobile access will have an impact.
<P>
XML is also contiuing to develop into a full-featured system for information
structuring.
<P>
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Activity">More information about the HTML-NG
activity</A>
<P>
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/XML/">More information about XML </A>
<H3>
  <A NAME="Vector_Graphics"></A>4.2 Vector Graphics
</H3>
<P>
The W3C has created a Working Group, which will be chartered to produce a
specification for a Scalable Vector Graphics format, written as a modular
XML tagset and usable as an XML namespace, which can be widely implemented
in browsers and authoring tools and which is suitable for widespread adoption
by the content authoring community as a replacement for many current uses
of raster graphics. For simple cases such as trivial inline graphics, it
should be possible to hand author the SVG format, and it should be possible
to cut and paste SVG graphical objects between documents and preserve their
appearance, linking behavior and style.
<P>
This will mean that the graphics in Web documents will be smaller, faster,
more interactive, and be displayable on a wider range of device resolutions
from small mobile devices through office computer monitors to high resolution
printers.
<P>
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Graphics/Activity">More information on the working
group</A>
<H3>
  <A NAME="Document_Object_Model_and_format"></A>4.3 Document Object Model
  and Formatting Model
</H3>
<P>
In the presentation model for the new generation of web technologies, the
formatting of a document is conducted through the use of a style sheet. This
is a separate document which&nbsp;allows authors and users to attach style
(e.g., fonts, spacing, and aural cues) to structured documents (e.g., HTML
documents and XML applications). By separating the presentation style of
documents from the content of documents, CSS2 and XSL simplifies Web and
XML authoring and site maintenance. Local processing of a document might
in the future also be conducted using a similar technology, called action
sheets. Style sheets can have media-specific properties, which makes them
a possible candidate for use with mobile devices.
<P>
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/Style/Activity">More information on style
sheets</A>.
<P>
The programmatical handling of a document is defined in the Document Object
Model, a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs
and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style
of documents. The Document Object Model provides a standard set of objects
for representing HTML and XML documents, a standard model of how these objects
can be combined, and a standard interface for accessing and manipulating
them.
<P>
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/DOM/Activity">More information on the Document
Object Model</A>.
<H3>
  <A NAME="HTTP-NG"></A>4.4 HTTP-NG
</H3>
<P>
The purpose of the HTTP-NG activity is to design, implement, and test a new
architecture for the HTTP protocol, based on a simple, extensible, distributed
object-oriented model. This includes a protocol for the management of the
network connections (WEBMUX), a protocol for transmitting messages between
systems (WIRE), a set of methods, interfaces and objects that demonstrates
a classical Web browsing case, as an example of what is possible with the
new protocol; and a test bed to test the implementation.
<P>

activity</A>.
<H3>
  <A NAME="Accessability"></A>4.5 Accessibility
</H3>
<P>
Accessibility for people with disabilities is relevant for mobile wireless
devices as this is a potentially large marketplace (over 10% of the population),
and in some cases accessibility is required (e.g. for sales in the US, under
Section 255 of the US Telecommunications Act). In addition, functions, such
as speech input or output, required to accommodate different kinds of disability
have carry-over benefits for non-disabled users of mobile devices, who may
be using the devices in "hands-free" or "eyes-free" situations.
<P>
W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) in coordination with other organizations
is addressing Web accessibility through several areas of work; two of these,
technology and guidelines, relate to mobile wireless devices.
<P>
In the area of technology, WAI liaises with W3C Working Groups developing
technologies which can facilitate accessibility, such as HTML, CSS, SMIL,
SVG. In the area of guidelines, WAI is developing guidelines for accessible
page authoring, for user agents, and for authoring tools, and coordinating
with the development of guidelines by the Mobile Access Interest Group.
<P>
<A HREF="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">More information about the Web Accessibility
Initiative</A>.
<H3>
  <A NAME="Internationalization"></A>4.6 Internationalization
</H3>
<P>
The correct representations of characters is an issue in all formats of writing,
not just the Latin alphabet. The aim of this activity is for the World Wide
Web to live up to its name, and the W3C continues work on the
internationalization of the Web, with the aim of ensuring that the necessary
features are included in W3C protocols and data format recommendations. The
general goal of W3C's work on internationalization is to ensure that W3C's
formats and protocols are usable world wide in all languages and writing
systems.
<P>

<H3>
  <A NAME="Metadata"></A>4.7 Metadata, Digital Signatures, and Trust Management
</H3>
<P>
Our current focus is, broadly, on establishing trust in the new medium of
the Web. This is a difficult problem, involving both social and technical
issues. Trust is established through a complex and ill-understood social
mechanism including relationships, social norms, laws, regulations, traditions,
and track records. Our activities are chosen to focus on specific areas that
are both important and tractable.
<P>
There is a core of technical issues that are required in any system that
is to be trusted:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>The ability to make statements that have agreed-upon meanings.</B>
  <DD>
    The W3C Metadata Activity provides a means to create machine-readable statements.
  <DT>
    <B>The ability to know who made the statement and to be assured that the
    statement is really theirs.</B>
  <DD>
    The W3C Digital Signature Initiative provides a mechanism for signing metadata
    in order to establish who is making the machine-readable statement.
  <DT>
    <B>The ability to establish rules that permit actions to be taken, based
    on the statements and a relationship to those who made the statements.</B>
  <DD>
    The PICS Rules specification allows rules to be written down so they can
    be understood by machines and exchanged by users.
  <DT>
    <B>The ability to negotiate binding terms and conditions.</B>
  <DD>
    The now-completed JEPI project created the Protocol Extension Protocol (PEP)
    to provide for negotiation on the Web. Negotiation is also at the core of
    the Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P).
  <DT>
    <B>Electronic commerce markup and payment.</B>
  <DD>
    Currently, the W3C has two working groups in this field, on markup for electronic
    commerce, and for payment initiation.

  <A NAME="Future_Development_From_the_WAP_Forum"></A>5. Future Development
  From the WAP Forum in this Field
</H2>
<P>
The WAP Forum's exclusive focus is mobile wireless technologies. The goal
of &nbsp;WAP is to create recommendations and specifications that support
the creation of advanced services on wireless devices, with particular emphasis
on the mobile telephone. The WAP Forum is creating recommendations and
technologies which enable these services on all mobile devices and on all
networks.
<P>
The WAP Forum has undertaken a variety of technical specification work relevant
to the W3C/WAP Forum collaborative efforts. These efforts all relate to the
use of World Wide Web technology on mobile devices, and ensuring that the
quality of these services is sufficient for mass deployment.
<H3>
  <A NAME="Achieving_the_Mobile_Wireless_Web"></A>5.1 Achieving the Mobile
  Wireless Web
</H3>
<P>
WAP is focused on enabling the interconnection of the Web and wireless terminals.
Significant focus has been given to mobile telephones and pagers, but all
technology has been developed with broader applicability in mind. The goal
of WAP is to enable an extremely wide range of wireless terminals, range
from mass-market mobile telephones and pagers to more powerful devices, to
enjoy the benefits of Web technology and interconnection.
<P>
Mobile devices have a unique set of features which must be exposed into the
Web, in order to enable the creation of advanced telephony services, including:
<DL>
  <DT>
    Location-based services
  <DT>
    Intelligent network functionality, including integration into the voice network
  <DT>
    Voice/data integration
</DL>
<P>
The WAP Forum is actively exploring solutions and specifications in these
areas. Future technical work will address the ongoing evolution of wireless
networks and mobile communication devices, including such issues as the
integration of Third Generation wireless networking technology.
<H3>
  <A NAME="Bandwidth_Efficiency"></A>5.2 Bandwidth Efficiency
</H3>
<P>
The WAP Forum is working to increase the bandwidth efficiency of Web technology,
to make it more applicable to the wireless environment. WAP Forum work includes:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Smart Web Proxies</B>
  <DD>
    - proxies capable of performing intelligent transformation of protocols and
    content, enabling more efficient use of the network, adaptation to device
    characteristics and adaptation to network characteristics.
  <DT>
    <B>Efficient Content Encoding </B>
  <DD>
    - bandwidth efficient encodings of standard Web data formats such as XML.
  <DT>
    <B>Efficient Protocols </B>
  <DD>
    - bandwidth efficient adaptations of standard web protocols, such as HTTP.
</DL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="Latency_Constraints"></A>5.3 Latency Constraints
</H3>
<P>
The WAP Forum is working to improve the behavior of Web technology in the
face of high network latencies, and in particular is focusing on the problems
of:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Tuning network protocols </B>
  <DD>
    to be adaptive and efficient given wide ranging latencies.
  <DT>
  <DD>
    <B>Creating Web applications</B>
  <DD>
    which are resilient to either high latency environments or highly variable
    latency situations.

<P>
Mobile wireless devices are characterized by a different set of user interface
constraints than a personal computer. The WAP Forum work in this area includes:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <B>Content adaptation</B>
  <DD>
    - mechanisms allowing a Web application to adapt gracefully to the
    characteristics of the device (beyond the current HTTP/1.1 content negotiation
    model).
  <DT>
    <B>User interface scalability</B>
  <DD>
    - content formats, e.g., markup and display languages, that are suitable
    to improverished devices, but which scale well to more sophisticated devices.

  <A NAME="Conclusion"></A>6. Conclusion
</H2>
<P>
In the area of Web technologies, the focus of the WAP Forum and the W3C overlap
to a significant degree. Direct overlaps occur in the areas of intelligent
proxies and protocol design; of XML applications; and in content adaptation,
e.g., through the use of vector graphics and style sheets. Future cooperation
may also occur in the area of electronic payment, where the work of the two
groups has potential overlap.
<P>
Instead of developing diverging solutions, it is the intent of both groups
to find common solutions that will address mobile requirements. In the area
of web technology, our goals overlap, especially in the long run, allowing
significant cooperation and shared development. To avoid fragmentation of
the Web standards, the groups should cooperate, and focus on achieving the
seamless integration of mobile devices into the Web.
