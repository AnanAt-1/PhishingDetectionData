PREFACE 


In  presenting  this  work  to  our  kindred  and  friends,  I 
desire  first  to  acknowledge  the  gracious  assistance  of  those 
who  have  contributed  family  statistics,  and  especially  would 
I  emphasize  the  unfailing  kindness  that  has  distinguished 
the  contributions  in  the  Anderson-Perrine  line,  of  Prances 
A.  Perrlne,  South  Amboy,  N.  J.,  together  with  the  MSS.  of 
the  late  Judge  John  Perrine.  Through  the  courtesy  of  D.  V. 
Perrlne,  Freehold,  N.  J.,  I  am  enabled  to  give  much  additional 
Perrine  data. 

I  am  under  personal  obligations  to  Alma  L.  Dickerson, 
Howell,  Mich.,  for  valuable  Smith  statistics,  and  to  Henrietta 
Porter  Boardman,  Phelps,  N.  Y.,  for  ancient  family  records. 

The  work  was  begun  principally  to  elucidate  the  Revolu- 
tionary ancestry  of  my  sons;  further  investigation  proved 
instructive  historically,  and  was  continued  with  gratifying 
results.  Yet  in  sending  forth  this  conclusion  of  hours  of 
strenuous,  yet  happy  labor,  I  am  moved  to  say— however 
crude  may  be  the  delineation  of  records  of  ages  past — when 
we  are  estimating  the  qualities  of  our  children,  it  is  well  to 
know  somewhat  of  the  character  of  their  predecessors,  and 
"a  little  oil  to  light  a  small  lamp  is  better  than  none  at  all." 


ii  TREFACE 

"The  diagnosis  of  his  parents  and  his  grandparents,"  says 
Andrew  Peabobdy,  D.  D.,  "is  the  prognosis,  the  horoscope  of 
the  child.  We  have  many  New  England  surnames  which  stand 
this  day  for  traits,  bodily  and  mental  and  moral,  that  belonged 
to  those  who  bore  the  same  names  two  hundred  years  ago. 
In  some  cases  the  traits  are  intensified  in  the  transmission, 
in  others  where  there  has  been  intermarriage  with  families 
of  strong  peculiarities,  they  are  slightly  attenuated.  In  the 
character  of  the  female  members  of  one  of  the  old  families 
you  can  always  trace  tokens  of  the  mother's  lineage." 

Many  who  are  herein  represented  "were  honoured  in  their 
generation  and  were  the  glory  of  their  time.     There  be  of 
them  that  have  left  a  name  behind  them— and  some  there  be 
which  have  no  memorial,  but  they  were  merciful  men  whose 
righteousness  hath  not  been  forgotten." — Eccles.  xliv.:  7,  8,  9. 
It  may  be  needless  to  say,  they  were  men  and  women 
whose  minds  and  hearts  were  well-equipped  with  the  high 
and  lofty  truths  of  the  bible,  and  though  at  times  they  dwelt 
in  the  shadow  of  divine  judgment,  their  hearts  were  warmed 
with  the  sunshine  of  divine  love.    Many  of  the  names  recorded 
herein  have  been   borne   by  quiet,   unostentatious   men   and 
women,  who  have  left  the  indelible  imprint  of  vicarious  lives 
upon  the  unwritten  pages  of  our  country's  history.    "We  have 
had  brave  men,"  said  Bradford,  "who  have  bravely  jeoparded 
their   lives  in  the  high  places  of  the  field   for  our   defense. 
0,  treat  them  not  with  ingratitude  after  all  the  service  they 
have   done — prefer  them   on   all   fit  occasions.     Let   us   give 
thanks  to  God  for  them,  even  for  such  gifts  of  heaven  as  we 


TREFACE  iii 

have  enjoyed  in  them."  (v.  Mather's  "Magnalia,"  1640,  A.  D.) 
The  soil  of  America  is  consecrated  with  the  blood  of  these 
martyrs  to  civilization,  and  sacred  with  the  imprint  of  their 
footsteps.  Let  the  tongue  be  forever  mute  that  gives  no  meed 
of  honour  to  the  names  of  these  pioneers  who  stood  in  the 
forefront  of  the  triumphal  march  of  progress.  Forbears  are 
they  whose  names  shine  like  stars  in  the  history  of  American 
independence.  Indomitable  perseverance  and  lofty  courage, 
wedded  to  habits  of  industry,  conquered  every  obstacle,  as 
they  toiled  together  in  the  name  of  Him  who  led  them  on, 
and  crowned  their  closing  days  with  peace  and  prosperity. 
Let  us  forever  perpetuate  their  memory  in  the  imperishable 
amber  of  our  affections,  and  preserve  the  record  of  their 
achievements  with  grateful  and  loyal  hearts.

EXPLANATIONS  AND  ABREVIATIONS 


Small  attention  was  paid  to  the  orthography  of  names 
until  the  early  part  of  the  last  century.  During  the  reign 
of  William  the  Conqueror,  the  use  of  surnames  was  generally 
accepted.  "The  clergy  of  that  period,"  says  Malmsbury,  "were

stood grammar  was  an  object  of  wonder  and  astonishment." 
Many  surnames  as  spelled  today  bear  small  similitude  to 
their  original  orthography,  the  phonetic  method  prevailed  in 
many  instances,  weightier  matters  taking  precedence,  evi- 
dently, in  the  lives  of  our  forbears.  We  consequently  find 
lineal  descendants  of  the  same  ancestor  who  write  their  names 
entirely  different  than  its  original  spelling;  especially  is  this 
the  case  in  families  of  Welsh,  Dutch,  French  and  German 
ancestry.

cernable  in  the  engraving,  shows  that  the  bearer  was  a  personal 
henchman  of  the  King  or  Duke  who  bestowed  upon  him  the  title  of

The  paternal  ascendants  of  Anna  Anderson,  wife  of  John 
Perrine  (John,  Joseph,  etc.)  were  eminent  In  the  colonial  his- 
tory of  New  Jersey.  Her  gr.-grandfather,  Col.  John  Anderson, 
married  Anna,  daughter  of  Gen.  John  Reid;  a  descendant  of 
the  latter  is  in  possession  of  a  memorandum  which  contains 
an  account  of  the  principal  events  in  the  life  of  this  gentleman, 
written  by  himself,     (v.  Archives  of  N.  J.) 

He  was  a  bookseller  in  Edinburgh,  Scotland,  and  came  to 
New  Jersey  in  charge  of  a  party  of  Scotch  emigrants.  He 
was  born  at  Mildrew  Castle,  Kirkintillock,  Scotland,  Feb.  13, 
1656.  In  1673  he  "went  to  learn  the  art  of  gardening"  in  the 
"famous  Hamilton  Gardens."  At  this  period  he  became  a  con- 
vert to  the  Society  of  Friends,  under  the  teaching  of  George 
Fox,  the  founder.  After  leaving  Drummond  he  located  at 
Fording,  where  he  wrote  a  book  entitled  "The  Scotch  Gard

ener."  In  1678  he  married  Margaret,  daughter  of  Henry  Mil- 
ler^ of  Cashon,  Kirkintillock.  Their  daughters,  Anna,  Helen, 
and  Margaret  were  born  in  Scotland.  The  family  "embarked 
from  Aberdeen,  Aug.  10,  1683,  and  on  the  28th  sailed  for 
America."  They  landed  on  Staten  Island  the  19th  of  Decem- 
ber, and  settled  in  Perth  Amboy,  N.  J.,  where  his  daughter 
Margaret  died,  and  his  son  John  was  born,  July,  1686. 

Mr,  Reid  became  Dep.  Surveyor  of  N.  J.  and  a  map  of 
lands  drawn  by  him  is  in  the  library  of  the  N.  J.  Hist.  Soc. 
(Ibid.)  For  this  work  he  was  granted  a  tract  of  land  in 
Topenemus,  Monmouth  Co.,  on  the  east  branch  of  the  Hope 
river,  whither  he  removed  in  1686,  and  named  the  estate 
"Hortensia."  At  this  period,  James,  Earl  of  Perth,  requested 
Capt.  Hamilton  "to  get  from  John  Reid  a  mapp  or  ground 
plott  thereoff"  (of  N.  J.),  "Descriving  how  it  lys"  and  how  it 

was  bounded. 

East  Jersey  Records,  Vol.   C,  p.   137,   has'  the   following: 

"Whereas,  the  Governor  and  Proprietors  of  East  and  West 
Jersey  has  wholly  refered  ye  division  line  of  ye  two  provinces 
to  us,  (as  by  their  bonds  doth  appear).  That  is  to  say,  gives 
us  full  power  to  runn  ye  same  as  we  think  fitt,  therefore  we 
do  hereby  declare  that  it  shall  runn  from  ye  north  side  of  ye 
mouth  or  Inlett  of  ye  little  Egg  Harbour,  a  streight  lyne  to 
Deleware  River  north  northwest  and  fifty  minutes  more  west- 
erly according  to  natural  position,  not  according  to  ye  magnet, 
whose  variation  is  nine  degrees  westward."

'  WITH  ALLIED  FAMILIES  3 

In  1703  John  Reid  united  with  the  Church  of  England,  and 
was  appointed  Surveyor  General  the  same  year. 

At  a  session  of  the  Assembly^  of  which  Mr.  Reid  was  a 
member,  they  took  into  consideration  the  militiai  act  passed 
in  Lord  Corntaury's  time,  by  which  the  Quakers  in  many  parts 
of  the  province  v/ere  greatly  oppressed."  John  Reid  and  five 
others  were  appointed  a  committee  "to  prepare  and  bring  in 
a  bill  for  explaining  an  act  in  this  province  passed  in  the  third 
year  of  her  Majesty,  Queen  Anne,  entitled:  'An  act  for  settling 
the  militia  of  this  province  for  relieving  persons  aggrieved 
thereby'."  A  bill  was  brought  by  the  committee,  in  which 
provisions  were  made  for  the  relief  of  the  sufferers,"  yet  the 
Council  rejected  it.  Prior  to  this  event  John  Reid  had  with- 
drawn from  the  Society  of  Friends,  but  he  yet  remained  their 
faithful  cham^pion,  for  we  find  among  the  bills  passed  Dec, 
1714,  "An  act  that  the  solemn  affirmation  and  declaration  of 
the  people  called  Quakers  shall  be  accepted  instead  of  an  oath 
in  the  usual  form,  and  for  qualifying  and  enabling  the  said 
people  to  serve  as  jurors,  and  execute  an  office  or  place  of 
trust  in  this  province."     This  act  was  in  force  twenty  years. 

In  a  letter  to  a  friend  in  Scotland,  written  Sept.  1st,  1684 
(nearly  a  year  after  his  arrival  in  America),  Mr.  Reid  says, 
concerning  the  Flora  of  the  Jerseys,  "There  are  a  great  store 
of  herbs  here.  I  have  not  had  time  to  inquire  into  them  all, 
neither  to  send  some  of  the  pleasant  (tho'  to  me  unknown) 
p:ants  of  this  country  to  James  Sutherland,  Physick  Gardener 
cf  Edinburgh,  but  tell  him  I  will  not  forget  him  when  oppor- 
turities  offer.     I  had  forgot  to  write  of  Ambo  or  New  Perth,

therefore  I  add  that  it  is  one  of  the -best  places  in  America, 
by  report  of  travelers,  for  a  town  of  trade.  For  my  part  I 
never  saw  any  so  conveniently  located." 

The  eventful  lives  of  Mr.  and  Mrs-  Reid  came  to  a  close  in 
their  beautiful  home,  "Hortensia,"  in  1723  and  1728  respect- 
ively.

his  son  and  heir.  Liber  C.  of  wills,  folio  76,  John  Anderson 
gives  date  of  deed  of  gift  from  John  Reid,  date  1701,  and  con- 
firmed to  him  by  the  Millers." 

Epitaphs  in  Topenemus  cemetery,  where  their  tombstones 
are  yet  standing:  "Here  lies  the  body  of  John  Reid,  who 
came  from  Scotland,  his  native  Country,  with  his  wife,  Mar- 
garet, and  three  daughters,  to  New  Jersey,  the  19  of  Dec, 
Anno.  Dom.  1683. 

"He  died  16  of  Nov.,  Anno  Dom,  1723,  Aged  67  years." 

"Here  lies  interred  dy  body  of  Margaret,  Wife  of  John  Reid,

with  this  society,  to  ordain  Mr.  John  Boyd.  The  country

Col.  John  ANDERSONf  was  born  in  Scotland  abt.  1665.  He 
married  abt.  1698,  Anna,  daughter  of  Gen.  John  Reid.  "He 
commanded  the  Caledoniai:  on  her  last  trip  to  this  country  in 
1686,"  when  some  of  the  passengers  were  the  Huguenot  refu- 
gees from  LaRochelle,  France,     (v.  Old  Family  Records.) 

Col.  Anderson  was  appointed  collector  customs  for  N.  J. 
about  1700.  The  following  citations  are  from  Archives  of 
N.  J.: 

"John  Anderson  and  Elisha  Parker^  wealthy  honest  men, 
were  recommended  for  the  Council  of  the  Province,  both  in-

tThe  Passing  of  the  Caledonia:  "In  1855  in  the  Amboy 
Bay,  might  still  have  been  seen  the  remains  of  an  old  ship 
named  the  Caledonia,  which  had  been  commanded  by  Robert 
Drummond.  Possibly  because  of  its  old  and  unserviceable 
condition  the  vessel  was  deserted,  presumably  in  1715,  and  a 
storm  breaking  its  moorings  to  the  Amboy  v/harf  it  drifted 
p.way  to  its  wreck.  It  is  supposed  that  this  ship  brought  emi- 
grants from  Scotland  as  early  as  1685,  and  it  is  a  matter  of 
history  that  it  brought  to  N.  J.  m.any  Scotch  families."  (v.

Rev.  Rob.  Wats,  of  New  York,  relating  to  tire  character  of 
John  Anderson: 

"By  Virtue  of  a  communication  to  me,  directed  from  the 
Hons.  the  Court  of  Directors- of  the  Co.  of  Scotland  trading  to 
Africa  and  the  Indies,  impowering  to  impact  into  the  man-

Captain  John  Anderson  hath  carefully  and  honestly  discharged 
the  trust  reposed  in  him  as  Master  and  Commander  of  s'd 
ship,  having  diligently  attended  her  three  years  and  upwards." 

"At  the  expiration  of  that  time,  she  being  unfit  for  further 
Service,  he   sailed   into  harbour,   sold  the   furniture   and   ap- 
parell.'"      *  *  *     "Excepting    the    Great    Guns,    v/hich,    under

The  recommendation  of  Col.  Anderson  and  others  to  be 
app.  Members  of  the  Council  of  the  Province  was  approved 
by  the  Quesn  in  Council,  June  15,  1713.  He  was  app.  Dec, 
1713,  and  held  the  position,  with  the  exception  of  a  few  months 
till  the  death  of  Gov.  Cosby  in  1736. — Seven  members  of  this 
Council  bore  the  Christian  name  of  John. — At  a  meeting  of 
the  Council,  April  20,  1722,  John  Anderson  dissented  from  the 
Governor's  expressed  opinion,  concerning  the  loyalty  of  a 
friend;  for  this  action  he  was  promptly  suspended  by  His 
Excellency,  but  the  Governor's  proceeding  was  not  endorsed 
by  the  Lords  of  Trade,  and  Anderson  resumed  his  seat  in  the 
Council. 

By  an  order  of  the  King,  Nov.  6,  1728,  John  Andersdn  was 
appointed  Commissioner  "for  the  trial  of  Pirates." 

He  was  also  one  of  the  Justices  of  the  Monmouth  Quarter 
Sessions  in  1711. 

Relating  to  the  death  of  Gov.  Cosby,  John  Anderson  writes 

as  follows: 

"Perth  Amboy  in  New  Jersey,  March  19,  1735. 

"To  THE  Duke  of  Newcastle:

obtain  money  to  purchase  clothing  for  officers  and  men.  Copies

:MQNMQUTH  BATTLE  CHURCH 

By  Geo.  W.  Bungay. 


"At  the  close  of  his  patriotic  oration  on  the  Fourth  of  July, 
the  writer  read  the  following  poem  in  the  "Old  Tennent 
Church."  The  church  building  was  erected  nearly  one  hun- 
dred and  forty  years  ago,  upon  the  site  which  afterward  be- 
came famous  and  historical  as  the  battle  ground  of  Monmouth. 
The  pew  stained  with  the  blood  of  a  wounded  soldier  remains 
as  it  was  at  the  time  of  the  Revolution,  and  the  bullet  holes  in 
the  walls  of  the  a-ncient  building  seem  like  the  dim  old  eyes  of 
the  past  looking  down  upon  the  present.  Near  this  historic 
structure  stand  the  same  old  trees  under  which  Washington 
held  counsel  with  his  staff,  and  the  shadows  of  their  trembling 
branches  touching  the  graves  of  the  soldiers  sleeping  there 
seemed  on  that  July  morning  like  dim  hands  reaching  through 
the  leaves  to  write  the  epitaph  of  those  brave  men  who  fought 
the  battle  of  Monmouth": 

In  vain  through  history  we  search, 
Or  look  where  honor's  eagles  perch 

On  golden  heights  of  song  and  story^ 
For  such  bright  fame  as  Tennent  Church 

Has  won.    It  stands  alone  in  glory. 

Its  steeple,  like  a  point  of  fire, 

From  this  world,  points  to  one  that's  higher; 

Its  doors  on  hospitable  hinges  turning, 
Invites  us  all  to  worship  nigher — 

With  flames  upon  her  altar  burning-. 


■  WITH  AI^LJED  FAMILIES  15 

Here  is  the  palpit,  here  the  pews. 

Where  grace  came  down  like  heavenly  dews 

Upon  the  people  and  their  pastor. 
Here  holy  men  proclaimed  the  news 

Of  love  and  mercy  from  their  Master. 

'Twas  here  the  sainted  Tennent  stood. 
And  there  his  flock  poured  out  their  blood, 

As  freely  as  the  clouds  pour  water, 
A  patriotic  brotherhood — 

Baptized  in  the  fire  and  blood  of  slaughter. 

The  wild  flowers  splashed  with  drops  of  red, 
Repeat  the  sacred  drops  they  shed, 

Above  the  dust  the  sexton  gathers— 
The  birds  in  branches  overhead 

Sing  the  soft  requiem  of  the  fathers. 

Tell  me,  ye  brave  old  trees  which  stand, 
Like  sentinels  so  tall  and  grand, 

Watching  the  camp  where  rest  our  braves. 
Did  Washington  give  his  command 

Beneath  your  shade,  upon  these  graves? 

Did  ye  clap  your  green  hands  with  glee 
When  our  fathers  made  the  redcoats  flee 

Over  the  fields  that  blushed  with  clover^' 
Did  ye  look  up  through  buds  and  see 

The  angel  Freedom  hovering  over? 

'Tis  not  the  tribute  of  a  tear 
We  give  the  heroes  sleeping  here; 
They  could  afford  to  die  and  we 
Now  feel  their  precious  presence  near, 
This  Sabbath  day  of  Liberty.

Bring  iorth  the  pen,  and  ope  the  scroll 
And  write  for  those  who,  yet,  unborn. 
May  praise  the  hand  that  would  enroll 
The  lineage,  on  from  soul  to  soul, 
Since  History's  earliest  morn. 

And  for  the  present  age  of  men 

Till  backward  fly  the  years  apace, 
Whene'er  they,  looking  through  your  pen, 
(Like  field-glass  brings  the  distance),  then 
They'll  meet  the  dim  Past  face  to  face. 

They'll  see  the  time  when  kingly  power 

Drove  from  the  fatherland  away 
Those  ones  who  helped  to  bring  its  flower, 
Those  men  who  fought  to  save  the  hour 
When  despots  held  their  sway. 

And  many  a  Mayflower  braved  the  deep. 

And  brought  the  sturdy  pioneer; 
While  dull  Despair  stayed  home  to  sleep, 
These  watchmen  climbed  the  rocky  steep 
To  sound  the  trump'  of  Freedom  clear! 


They 'ir  see  the  time  when  Washington 
First  drew  his  battle  charger's  rein, 

Our  fathers'  sires  were  there  to  run. 

To  check  the  raid  at  Lexington, 
And  fight  on  Concord's  plain! 

Well  might  we  envy  those  who  caught  '- 

That  peaen  of  the  free — 
(No  instrument  was  ever  taught 
To  sing  such  strains  with  good-will  fraught), 

The  bell  of  Liberty! 

And,  as  it  pealed,  from  every  land — 

Like  children  on  to  school — 
There  trod  the  multitudes,  or  strand — 
— Or  tribes  or  creeds — came  hand  in  hand 

To  know  Columbia's  rule! 

Think  not  the  golden  age  behind — 

"The  best  is  yet  to  be!" 
And  generations  here  may  find 
Some  inspiration  to  remind, 

Of  world-democracy. 

When  motherlands  who  saw  their  sons 

Haste  frcm  their  western  doors  away. 
Shall  at  their  eastern  portals  hear 
Their  children's  childrea's  footsteps  near. 
To  hail  the  brighter  day.

PERRINE  FAMILIES 


"Ye  shall  go  over  and  possess  that  good  land."— Z&gt;ew^.  iv.:22. 


The  primitive  spelling  of  the  name  was  Perrin,  and  is  of 
Norman  origin.     Many  cognate  families,  however,  write  their 
names  variously.  Perin,   Ferine,  Prine,   Perrein,   Perryn  and 
Perrine.     Precedence  is  given  in  these  pages  to  the  orthogra- 
phy which  obtains  by  the  larger  number  of  families  recorded. 
The  Perrines  herein  given  are— in  consonance  to  old  family 
records— des.  from  Henri  Perrine   (Perrin?),  of  La  Rochelle, 
Lower   Charente,    France.      Following   the    revocation    of   the 
Edict  of  Nantes  by  Louis  XIV.,  1685,  many  of  the  loyal  and 
devoted  sons  of  France  were  forced  by  persecution  to  forsake 
their  native  land.     Whoever  bore  the  name  of  Huguenot  suf- 
fered untold  tortures,  which  they  bore  with  most  wonderful 
fortitude,  rather  than  disclaim  their  christian  principles;  and 
with  only  such  of  their  worldly  goods  as  they  could  conceal 
about   their   persons,   sought   refuge   in   foreign  lands.     Over 
seventy   of  these  refugees  embarked  from  La  Rochelle,  and,  it 
is  said,  "covenanted  upon  the  seas  that  they  and  their  children 
would  be  the  Lords."    They  came  by  the  way  of  the  Nether- 
lands "in   the  large  sailing  vessel  Caledonia,   commanded  by 


18  PERRINE  FAMILIES 

Capt.  John  Anderson.  This  vessel  reached  Amboy  Bay  in  a 
dilapidated  condition;  while  striving  to  make  port  she  was 
entirely  wrecked  on  the  south-eastern  shore  of  Staten  Island. 
Among  the  number  who  were  rescued  were  Henri  and  Daniel 
Perrine.  The  latter  never  married."  They  settled  on  the 
island.  Henri  married  and  was  the  progenitor  of  the  families 
herein  treated. 

Another  record  of  the  name  in  North  America  appears  in 
the  register  of  Montreal,  Can.:  "Henri  Perrine,  1661,  emigrant 
from  France.  Matthieu  Perrine,  1694,  and  Antoine  Perrine, 
1720";  others  of  the  name  became  residents  of  that  city  in 
later  years.  The  name  appears  again  in  the  early  records  of 
Mass.  Colony,    (v.  "Perrin  Family,"  by  Glover  Perrin.) 

The  first  record  of  the  name  in  N.  J.  dates  to  the  advent  of 
Gov.  Philip  Cartaret,  "who  did  not  arrive  to  his  government 
of  New  Jersey  till  the  latter  end  of  the  summer  1665" — when 
he  came  "he  summoned  a  council,  granted  lands,  and  admin- 
istered the  government  on  the  plan  of  general  concessions." 
"He  took  up  his  residence  in  Elizabeth;  with  him  came  about 
thirty  people,  some  of  them  servants."  Previous  to  this  period 
there  were  supposed  to  be  about  fifty  white  people  in  the 
province,  (v.  Smith's  Hist.  Nova  Caesaera.)  Barber  says  that 
each  of  the  governor's  servants  were  granted  land  in  N.  J. 
and  settled  thereon.  The  foregoing  is  corroboratd  by  Archives 
of  N.  Y.:  On  July  29,  1665,  the  ship  Philip  made  port  in  N.  Y. 
Among  the  passengers  were  Gov.  Cartaret  and  a  retinue  of 
eighteen  servants,  "who  were,"  says  Salter,  "presumably  from 


PERRINE  FAMILIES  19 

the  Isle  of  Jersey."  Two  of  these  were  Daniel  Perrin  and  Ma- 
ria Thorel,  who  were  married  in  Elizabethtown,  Feb.  18,  1666. 
Their  marriage  license  Is  said  to  have  been  the  first  issued  in 
the  colony,  (ibid.)  It  is  probable  that,  to  escape  persecution, 
Daniel  came  to  N.  J.  in  the  guise  of  a  servant.  His  claim  to 
a  noble  lineage  (v.  "Story  of  An  Old  Farm,"  by  Mellick)  is 
substantiated  by  the  following  pedigree,  which  was  in  the 
possession  of  Sir.  Geo.  Cartaret,  Vice  Chamberlain  to  the 
King,  and  was  copied  by  G.  D.  Scull,  of  Oxford,  Eng.;  recopied 
by  Charles  Perrine  Smith,  of  Trenton,  N.  J.,  and  cited  by  D. 
V.  Perrine,  of  Freehold: 

"Rawlin  Tampier,  Lord  of  Rosell,  slayne  at  ye  siege  of  ye 
Castle  of  Jersey  (tempore  Edward  IV.),  m.  dau.  of  Richard 
Weston,  a  Captain  under  Sir  Richard  Harliston,  at  ye  Castle  of 
Jersey."  Their  dau.  m.  Dominique  Perrin,  "a.  Burgess  of  the 
town  of  St.  Pol.  in  Guernsey."  Their  ch.  were  Edmund,  (who 
became  Lord  of  Rosell,  in  the  right  of  his  mother,  after  the 
death  of  her  bachelor  brother).  John^  James,  and  a  dau.  who 
m.  James  Guill,  Bailey  of  Guernsey."  A  Bailly  ranks  second  to 
Lieut.  Gov.  in  importance.  To  the  Romans,  the  Isle  of  Jersey 
was  known  as  Caesarea;  this  Isle  was  occupied  by  the  French 
until  the  battle  of  Barnet  had  placed  Edward  IV.  on  the  throne 
of  Eng.  After  repeated  invasion  by  the  British,  the  French 
recognized  the  neutrality  of  the  Channel  Isles.  The  contiguous 
Isle  of  Sark  was  granted  by  Queen  Elizabeth  in  fee  simple  to 
Helier  de  Cartaret,  of  St.  Quen,  Jersey,  (v.  "Island  of  Jersey, 
iis  Towns  and  Antiquities.")  Nearly  everybody  in  Jersey, 
says  Parker,  "was  'couzain'  to  his  neighbor," 


20  PERRINE  FAMILIES 

Others  of  the  name  of  i^errine  (Perrin?)  fled  to  Holland, 
Ireland  and  the  Indies.  "Justice  Perrine,  1685,  a  steadfast  Hu- 
guenot, left,  for  conscience  saK:e,  his  property  in  France  and 
became  a  refugee  at  Lisbon,  north  of  Ireland,  and  removed  to 
Waterford.  A  des.  of  his.  The  Right  Hon.  Louis  Perrine,  b.  in 
County  of  Waterford,  became  King's  Counsellor,  and  was  elect- 
ed member  of  Parliament  for  Dublin,  1831.  In  1836  he  became 
Justice  of  the  Court  of  the  King's  Bench  in  Ireland."  (Cour- 
tesy D.  V.  Perrine.) 

An  interesting  pen-picture  of  La  Rochelle,  the  native  city 
of  the  Perrine  refugees,  who  fled  to  America,  is  given  in  a 
letter,  from  Jennie  LaRue  Mesick,  who  was  a  descendant  of 
Henri  Perrine: 

"The  position  of  LaRochelle  as  a  capitol  for  protestants 
was  in  many  respects  superior  to  that  of  Orleans.  The  town 
was  well  defended  by  forts  and  strong  walls,  and,  by  keeping 
a  communication  with  English  ports,  reinforcements  might 
be  received  there.  The  old  town  still  preserves  many  buildings 
which  were  there  in  the  sixteenth  century.  Formost  among 
these  is  the  Hotel  de  Ville,  with  its  rich  and  delicate  tracery, 
a  miracle  of  mediaeval  work.  Within  its  great  hall  have  been 
heard  the  voices  of  Coligny,  Conde,  Isanne  d' Albert,  Andelot, 
Rohann,  LaRochefoucauld,  Porcein,  and  all  the  leaders  of  the 
great  revolt.  There  they  met  in  grave  council  when  their 
cause  seemed  almost  hopeless,  and  nothing  remained  but  to 
sell  their  lives  as  dearly  as  they  could. 

"The  protestant  Temple  is  a  modem  structure  which  stands 


PERRINE  FAMILIES  21 

upon  the  site  of  tlie  one  wherein  Coligny  and  the  early  con* 
fessors  met  to  pray  and  hear  the  word.  As  one  wanders  about 
the  narrow  streets  of  the  old  town  you  pass  under  cool  cloisters 
and  corridors  of  stone.  Looking  up  at  the  stone  roof  from 
time  to  time  you  read  there  many  an  old  Huguenot  legend, 
many  a  pious  ejaculation,  many  a  word  of  faith  carved  and 
inscribed  iii  tiioso  aariy  da-ys  when  women  and  childrei:  re- 
mained at  home  to  pray  within  its  walls,  while  the  men  went 
out  to  fight  under  the  brave  admiral.  At  the  harbor-mouth 
still  stands  two  great  towers,  which  command  its  entrance, 
and  once  gave  shelter  to  Coligny's  fleet.  The  walls  of  the  town 
are  those  of  the  last  century,  the  old  having  been  destroyed;

Henri  Perrine,  son,  presumably,  of  Count  Pierre  Perrine  of 

La  Rochelle,  France,  "Landed  on  Staten  Island  in  1685-6  and 
remained  there;  there  is  a  county  record  that  his  brother  Dan- 
iel sold  land  in  1687.     Henri  married  .    His  sons  were 

John,  Henry,  Peter  V.  and  Daniel."  The  pioneer  home  of  the 
Perrines,  a  stone  house  on  Staten  Island,  still  remains  there, 
(v.  illustration.)  The  stone  part  was  built  about  1688,  on  the 
street  then  known  as  "The  King's  Highway,"  now  the  Rich- 
mond Road.  Frame  additions  have  been  added  to  the  original 
dwelling,  which  is  ^'the  oldest  on  the  Island  occupied  by  the 
family  who  built  it."  Older  members  of  the  family  who  re- 
mained on  the  Island  married  into  the  families  of  Mersereau, 
Vanderbilt,  Guyon,  McClean,  Simonson  and  Bedell.

JOHN  PERRINE  {Joseph^  John,  Henri),  b.  in  Machaponix 
July  15,  1771,  m.  Anne  Anderson  (Capt.  John^  James,  Col. 
John).  They  lived  on  the  old  homestead,  which  comprised  a 
farm  of  three  hundred  acres.  At  an  early  period  they  kept 
an  inn.  He  was  an  officer  in  St.  Peter's  chh.,  a  man  of  high 
estate,  and  honored  for  his  probity  and  nobility  of  character. 
His  wif»  was  a  lady  of  attractive  personality,  dignified,  hos- 
pitable, small  of  stature,  with  a  neat,  well-rounded  figure.  In 
letters  written  by  her  to  her  gr.  dau.,  she  says:  "I  have  a 
yard  full  of  beautiful  shrubs  and  flowers,  if  you  were  here 
you  would  be  pleased  with  them." — "The  young  ladies  of  your 
acquaintance  inquire  after  you;  the  young  gentlemen  are  anx- 
ious to  ask,  but  durst  not." — "I  trust  you  are  pleased  with 
your  new  friends,  knowing  however,  the  good,  sound  sense 
you  possess,  we  know  that  you  will  endeavor  to  make  your- 
selves happy  in  whatever  situation  you  may  be  placed."  The 
most  tender  christian  admonition  and  prudent  council  illum- 
ines the  time-worn  pages  of  these  dear  old  letters. 

There  are  yet  living  some  people  who  may  look  back  to  the 
old  home  (v.  illustration),  and  the  dear  faces  that  beamed  a 
welcome  on  their  coming;  where  in  its  spacious  rooms  the 
widest   and   kindest   hospitality    continually   prevailed.      Mrs.

SARAH  DAVISON  APPLEGET,  wife  of  Judge  Perrine,  was 
b.  July  19,  1809,  and  was  the  dau.  of  Thomas  and  Sarah  Baird 
Appleget,  and  gr.  dau.  of  Anthony  Appleget,  who  fought  in  the 
Revolution,  and  was  killed  in  his  own  home  by  the  Tories  and 
"Pine  Robbers."  There  is  an  old  deed  in  the  family  conveying 
land  from  Jno.  Watson  to  Thomas  Appleget  and  acknowledged 
before  Robert  Hunter  Morris.  "The  names  of  Thomas  and 
Anthony  have  alternated  in  the  Appleget  family  for  many 
generations."  Sarah  Baird  Appleget,  wife  of  Thomas  Appleget 
(parents  of  Mrs.  Perrine)  "lived  to  the  age  of  one  hundred 
and  six  years,  in  full  possession  of  all  her  faculties  until  a 
few  years  prior  ta  her  death.  She  was  the  dau.  of  Capt. 
Baird,"  who  distinguished  himself  in  loyal  service  in  the  Rev- 
olution"; he  was  a  large  land  owner  and  a  des.  of  Sir  John 
Baird,  one  of  "Cromwell's  Ironsides,"  The  old  Baird  home- 
stead burned  to  the  ground;  family  records  were  consumed  in 
the  flames.  Sarah  Baird  and  Thomas  Appleget  were  the  par- 
ents of  eight  eh.,  Anthony,  Lydia,  Abigail,  Baird,  Sarah  Davi- 
son, Disbrow,  Thomas  and  John.

estate  to  be  paid  unto  her  immediately  after  my  decease  by 
my  Executor  hereafter  named,  as  her  Dowry.  Again  I  give 
Unto  my  eldest  son,  Gabriel  Appleget,  twenty  acres  of  which 
t  purchased  of  John  Thorp  Lying  in  MOn.  Co.  which  I  give

RICHARD  STOUT,  and  wife,  lineal  ancestors  of  the  ch.  of 

Geo.  C.  and  Adelaide  Perrine  Stout,  were  among  the  first  set- 
tlers of  Gravesend,  L.  I.,  and  later  "the  most  prominent  of  the 


8d  PERRINE  FAMILIES 

founders  of  Monmoutli  Co.,  N.  J.  "He  was  one  of  the  twelve 
named  in  the  Monmouth  Patent,  Apr.  8,  1665,  and  became  a 
permanent  settler.  He  doubtless  concluded  with  Sir  Henry 
Hudson  that  "it  was  a  very  good  land  to  fall  in  with,  and  a 
pleasant  land  to  see,"  yet  the  first  attempt  of  Mr.  and  Mrs. 
Stout  10  locate  there  "with  other  Holland  Families"  was  un- 
successful, in  consequence  of  Indian  troubles;  but  this  did  not 
discourage  their  enterprising  souls;  the  second  attempt  re- 
sulted favorably.  Mr.  Stout  m.  abt.  1622,  PENELOPE  VAN 
PRINCIS»  of  Holland.  "To  her,"  says  Salter,  "should  the 
credit  be  given  of  the  earliest  efforts  of  the  whites  to  settle 
in  Monmouth  Co." 

"Penelope  Stout  was  born  at  Amsterdam,  about  the  year 

1602;  her  father's  name  was  Vanprincis;  she  and  her  first 
husband  (whose  name  is  not  known)  sailed  for  New  York 
about  the  year  1620;  the  vessel  was  stranded  at  Sandy  Hook; 
the  crew  got  ashore  and  marched  towards  the  said  New  York; 
but  Penelope's  (for  that  was  her  name)  husband  being  hurt 
in  the  wreck,  could  not  march  with  them;  therefore  he  and 
his  wife  tarried  in  the  woods;  they  had  not  been  long  in  the 
place  before  the  Indians  killed  them  both  (as  they  supposed) 
and  stripped  them  to  the  skin;  however,  Penelope  came  to, 
though  her  skull  was  fractured,  and  her  left  shoulder  so 
hacked,  that  she  could  never  use  that  arm  like  the  other; 
she  was  also  cut  acioss  the  abdomen,  so  that  her  bowels  ap- 
pealed; these  she  kept  '.n  with  her  hand;  she  continued  in 
this  condition  for  seven  days  taking  shelter  in  a  hollow  tree, 
and  eating  the  excrescence  of  it;   the  seventh  day  she  saw  a 


PERRINE  FAMILIES  37 

deer  passing  by  with  arrows  sticking  in  it,  and  soon  after  two 
Indians  appeared,  whom  she  was  glad  to  see,  in  hope  they 
would  put  ber  out  of  her  misery;  accordingly,  one  made  to- 
ward her  to  knock  her  on  the  head,  but  the  other,  who  was 
an  elderly  man,  preventing  him,  and,  throwing  his  matchcoat 
about  her,  carried  her  to  his  wigwam,  and  cured  her  of  her 
wounds  and  bruises;  after  that  he  took  her  to  New  York,  and 
made  a  present  of  her  to  her  countrymen,  viz.,  an  Indian 
present,  expecting  ten  times  the  value  in  return.  It  was  in 
New  York  that  one  Richard  Stout  married  her;  he  was  a 
native  of  England  and  of  good  family;  she  was  now  in  her 
22nd  year  and  he  in  his  40th.  She  bore  him  seven  sons  and 
three  daughters,  viz.,  Jonathan  (founder  of  Hopewell),  John, 
Richard,  James,  Peter,  David,  Benjamin,  Mary,  Sarah,  Alice; 
the  daughters  married  into  the  families  of  the  Bounds,  Pikes, 
Throckmortons  and  Skeltons,  and  so  lost  the  name  of  Stout; 
the  sons  married  into  the  families  of  Bullen,  Crawford,  Ash- 
Ion,  Traux,  etc.,  and  had  many  children.  The  mother  lived 
to  the  age  of  110  and  saw  her  offspring  multiplied  into  502  in 
abouL.  88  years."     (v,  Benedict's  Hist.  Baptists.)

cross  to  which  the  sorrowful  hopefully  turned;  her  Christian 
smile  lighted  dark  places.  Gentle,  sublime,  patient,  she  seemed 
to  bear  the  heart-burdens  of  others  with  an  inspired  spirit 
She  taught  the  dying  how  to  live,  and  the  living  how  to  die."

Sandstone,  loved  stream  of  our  childhood. 

Around  thee,  weird  memories  throng, 
We  list,  the  wild  voice  of  the  wilderness, 

Above  treetops,  the  Great  Spirit  song&lt; 

Again  the  deep  drum  of  the  partridge. 

The  locust  voice,  shrill  and  so  clear. 
At  night  the  wild  clamor  of  wolves, 

At  morn — see  the  bounding  of  deer. 

At  night,  by  the  willows  the  camp-fires 

Of  red  men  who  came  not  to  stay, 
Who  passed  with  the  dews  of  the  morning 

In  silence,  in  trail  far  away. 

At  morn,  a  bright  bevy  of  children, 

All  armed  with  a  basket  or  pail, 
In  gladness,  across  the  free  landscape. 

We  are  marching  to  school  in  the  traiL 

Again,  I  see  the  log  school  house, 

Its  desk,  its  chimney  and  door; 
The  three  long  encircling  benches. 

That  rocked  on  its  uneven  floor. 

It's  night—the  fireplace  is  lighted. 

The  benches  are  filling — and  then, 
On  the  walls,  in  tin  holders  are  hangings 

Candles  lighting  the  faces  of  men  .;

Who  made  towns,  laid  roads,  built  causeways — 

Undaunted,  these  brave  sons  of  toil 
Made  laws — planned  the  future  together, 

And  wrested  their  bread  from  the  soil. 

In  patience,  with  five  j'^oke  of  oxen. 

Slowly  combat  the  unbroken  sward, 
Made  fences — from  seed  grew  the  orchard; 

Made  homes — its  delight  their  reward. 

Still  a  few  by  their  fireside  linger,

Dearinf?  was  deeply  interested  in  her  family  history.  Her

brought  to  Sandstone  by  her  mother  marks  the  location  of 
their  first  pioneer  dwelling.     She  d.  Apr.  11,  1896. 

"Mr.  and  Mrs.  Dearing  settled  in  Sandstone,  Mich.,  on  the 
old  Perrine  homestead,  which  was  ceded  to  her  father, 
Henry  Perrine,  by  the  government  in  183a,  and  they  are  buried 
here  with  two  succeeding  generations,  i.  e.:    Henry  Perrine, 


*  The  following  excerpts  are  from  Mrs.  Bearing's  Journal: 
"I  have  the  fragment  of  a  letter,  dated  October  6th,  1868,  from 
Rev.  William  H.  Perrine,  as  he  was  en  route  for  Palestine,  in 
which  he  sketched  the  battle  ground  of  Monmouth,  and  de- 
scribes his  visit  to  an  old  aunt,  Ellen  Cooper"  {nee  Eleanor  Per- 
rine), "who  was  keenly  delighted  at  again  seeing  her  brother 
Henry's  soo.  Quoting  from  the  letter:  'She  threw  her  arms 
about  my  neck,  almost  smothering  me  with  kisses.  We  sat 
down,  she  holding  mj'  hand  in  hers,  talking  of  Henry  and 
Auld  Lang  Syne.  "Oh,  my  dear  boy,  God  has  sent  you  here. 
Oh,  biess  the  Lord,  O,  my  soul!"  Then  rising,  putting  her 
hand  upon  my  head,  first  quoting  from  the  psalm,  "May  the 
Lord  be  upon  my  right  hand,"  she  said,  "Our  ancestors  cove- 
nanted for  themselves,  and,  until  the  latest  generation,  to  be 
the  Lord's,  and  may  the  blessings  of  our  gracious  God  rest 
upon  Lx^em  all."  'When  the  Huguenot  refugees  came  in  the 
Caledonia  'two  of  that  company  were  an  old  Frenchman  and 
his  wile,  with  two  little  boys  v/rapped  in  a  green  damask 
eatin  petticoat  trimmed  with  gold,  and  from  those  two  boys 
all  the  Perrines  have  sprung,'  to  the  des.  of  these,  the  aged 
saint  bequeathed  her  h'^^y  benediction." 


^^  PERRINK  FAMIUEvS 

born  1786;  John  Perrine,  b.  1760,  at  Freehold,  N.  J.    Mr.  Bear- 
ing was  a  man  of  great  probity  of  character  and  ability;  rec- 
ognized by  the  community  in  which  he  lived  as  the  highest 
type  of  a  Christian  gentleman;   a  deacon  of  the  Cong'l  chh. 
until  his  death.    He  was  present  at  the  convention  held  under 
the  oaks  at  Jackson,  Mich.,  when  the  Republican  party  was 
first  organized,  and  was  made  Chairman  of  the  Com.  on  reso- 
lutions, which  were  adopted  by  that  body  at  that  time.    Mrs. 
Bearing  was  a  woman  of  great  force  of  character.    Possessed 
of  unusual  intelligence,  she  was  a  great  student  of  history  and 
literature,  and  a  poet  of  no  mean  ability;  an  inspiration  not 
only  to  her  children,  but  to  all  the  youth  of  the  community. 
She  was  a  true  descendant  of  her  Huguenot  fathers,  who  died 
for  their  faith;  proud  of,  and  loyal  to  the  covenant  made  by 
them  upon  mid-ocean,  that  "they  and  their  children  snould  be 
the   Lord's,   unto   the   latest   generation."     And   although    a 
woman  of  broad  mind  and  ideas,  she  remained  until  her  death 
a  faithful  and  earnest  member  of  the  Cong'l  chh.   in  Sand-

which  he  lived  in  all  humility  and  sincerity.  He  was  a

*  Dr.  Francis  Le  Barox — the  hero  of  Mrs.  Austin's  "Name- 
less Nobleman" — was  surgeon  of  a  ship  from  France  which 
wrecked  in  Buzzard's  Bay,  1694.  He  was — with  other  officers 
— made  a  prisoner.  "On  the  way  to  Boston  he  stayed  over 
night  with  Wm.  Barnes."  A  lady  in  the  town  had  that  day 
"suffered  a  severe  compound  fracture  of  a  limb,"  which  the 
chirurgeons  of  the  town  were  about  to  amputate.  Dr.  Le 
Baron  asked  permission  to  examine  the  fracture;  he  did  so 
and  saved  the  limb.  He  obtained  Lt.-Gov.  Stoughton's  per- 
mission to  remain  in  Plymouth,  and  d.  there  in  1704.  His 
rank  in  France  was  supposed  to  be  that  of  a  Baron ;  from  this 
title,  doubtless,  arose  the  family  name.  Dr.  Le  Baron  built 
in  1703  the  "old  tavern-house"  on  the  lot  where  now  stands 
the  Baptist  chh;  built  also  abt.  1700  the  "Swift  House"  in 
Plymouth,  Mass.  He  m.  1695  the  Puritan  maid,  Mary  Wilder.

b.  abt.  1787,  d.  in  Eden,  N.  Y.,  Mar.  10,  1867.  In  April,  1839, 
Mr.  and  Mrs.  Perrine  were  attracted  by  the  glowing  accounts 
of  the  fertile  country  in  the  "Western  Frontier,"  and  decided 
to  migrate  thither.  This  was  the  era  of  the  slow-moving  ox- 
team — when  no  railroads  spanned  the  continent — and  it  has 
been  told  ,that  when  this  family  were  traveling  on  the  "Camp 
Road"  in  Hamburg  the  wheels  of  their  wagon  sunk  in  the 
yielding  roadbed,  to  the  hubs.  On  the  highway,  after  crossing 
Eden  township,  at  a  turn  to  the  left — to  mark  the  spot — the 
pioneers  blazed  a  stalwart  cucumber  magnolia — the  tree  re- 
mains yet — and  here  the  family  decided  to  settle  on  land  for- 
merly purchased  from  the  Holland  Land  Co.  Mr.  Perrine  built 
an  inn,  which  was  the  "changing  place"  between  Buffalo  and 
Gowanda  for  the  stage-coach  horses.  This  hostelry  was  twice, 
with  its  contents,  entirely  consumed  by  fire,  excepting  a 
Chauncey  Jerome  clock,  which  was,  by  a  remarkable  coinci- 
dence, saved  in  both  instances  from  the  flames  by  the  same 
neighbor,  G.  W.  Stoddard.  (The  ancient  timepiece  still  counts

What  dearer  can  he  ? 

Every  haunt  in  its  wild  wood, 
Every  by-path  and  tree. 

O  the  blossoms  of  c^'ildhood, 
How  liberal  their  smile; 

And  the  woodbine  and  Itlac, 
That  cheered  us  the  while. 


O  the  fruits  of  our  childhood 

With  flavor  so  bland; 
The  wealth  of  the  orchard — 

The  best  of  the  land. 

Like  the  vines  of  the  wildwood 

That  grew  never  apart 
So  the  sweet  thoughts  of  childhood 

Cling  close  to  the  J'eart.

may  know  where  to  place  the  author  of  "Havana,"  a  poem

inspiring  lines: 

"Oh  heart!  Take  hope!  The  songs  of  the  soul 

That  the  voice  cannot  sing  to-day. 
May  join  with  the  peans  of  glory  that  roll 

Through  the  fields  of  eternal  May. 
And  the  pictures  that  only  find  place  in  the  mind — 

That  never  enthuse  the  hand — 
May  meet  us  there,  in  some  paradise  fair, 
Beyond   our  border-land."

Near  Manomet  through  Samoset, 

A  welcome  to  the  brave  ! 

And  since  that  day  the  tide 

From  off  the  Eastern  main, 
Has  swept  the  country  wide 

And  peopled  hill  and  plain; 
As  ship  on  ship,  like  Mayflower  bold. 

Essayed  their  load  to  land, 
Columbia's  word  might  e'er  be  heard — 

A  welcome  on  the  strand  ! 

Ah,  strange  did  the  poor  Indian  think 

White  men  would  press  him  sore, 
'Till  on  Pacific's  rocky  brink 

His  struggles  would  be  o'er. 
But  when  Columbia  came  to  stand 

Upon  that  shore,  so  free, 
She  would  but  clasp  within  her  grasp 

The  islands  of  the  sea.

"Aw(Z  I  iDill  give  unto  thee — the  land  wherein  thou  art  a 
stranger." — Gen.  xvii. 


BARBER,  BARBIER,  BARBOUR 

Concerning  the  advent  of  the  Pilgrim  and  Puritans  in  Mass. 
colony,  the  following  citation  is  taken  from  the  descriptive 
and  pedantic  "Magnalia"  by  Mather:  "The  God  of  Heaven 
served  as  it  were  a  summons  upon  the  spirits  of  his  people 
in  the  English  nation,  stirring  up  the  spirits  of  thousands, 
which  never  saw  the  faces  of  each  other,  with  a  most  unani- 
mous inclination  to  leave  all  pleasant  accommodations  of  their 
native  country,  and  go  over  a  terrible  ocean  into  a  more  terri- 
ble desert  for  the  pure  enjoyment  of  all  His  holy  ordinances." 

"The  principal  planters  of  Mass.  colony  were  English  coun- 
try-gentlemen of  fortune,  improved  by  liberal  education,  of 
extreme  ambition,  concealed  under  the  appearance  of  religious 
zeal."  (Chalmers.)  About  1635,  this  colony  had  become,  says 
Mather,  "like  a  hive  of  overstocked  bees,  and  many  a  thought 
of  swarming  into  new  plantations." 

Apropos  of  a  prospective  migration,  Gov.  Bradiord  writes: 


82  BARBOUR  PAMlUm 

"Some  of  the  neighbors  in  ye  Bay  hearing  Of  ye  fame  of  ya 

Connightacute  River  had  a  hankering  mind  after  it,  and  noW 

Understanding   ye   Indians   were    swepte   away   with   ye   late 

hiortalitie,  the  fear  of  whom  was  an  obstacle  before— they  noW 
begin  to  prosecute  with  great  vigor." 

Among  the  number  of  "Worthy  and  Learned  Oenteel  per* 

Sons  going  to  be  buried  alive  in  the  banks  of  the  Quinniticut," 

again   quoting  Gov.   Bradford,   were   Thomas  Barber,  Nathan 

Cjillette,  Nicholas  Palm.er  and  John  Porter.     A  complete  list 

of  the  party  who  accompanied  their  pastor  to  the  new  and 

Untried  valley  of  the  Connecticut  is  given  in  Stiles'  "Ancient 

XVindsor/' 

An  inherited  love  Of  libercy  in  these  voluntary  exiles,  con^ 
Quered  old  longings  for  the  happy  home-land  of  their  fore- 
fatherSi  and  again  with  lofty  izeal  they  pledged  anew  their 
loyalty  to  their  adopted  country,  and,  together,  journeyed 
afoot  a  distance  of  a  hundred  miles,  "through  a  trackless  wil* 
derness,  a  compass  their  only  guide;  with  much  difficulties 
traveling  thro'  unknown  woods  and  swamps — thro'  thickets—^ 
Over  crossed  trees,  which  when  they  missed  they  sunk  into  an 
uncertain  bottom,  and  wade  up  to  their  knees."  Household 
goods  had  be^n  shipped  via.  boats  that  v;ere  in  charge  of 
their  families.  Having  taken  with  them  a  hundred  and  sixty 
Cattle,  the  milk  of  the  cows  furnished  them  refreshing  nour- 
ishment, during  their  two  weeks'  journey.  This  party  began 
the  settlement  of  Windsor,  Ct.,  in  the  spring  of  1636.  Theif 
remoteness  from  older  plantations  taught  them  to  practice 
the  most  rigid   economy,  but  With  a  deep  and  abiding  faith

in  Godi  they  were  inspired  to  build  in  that  dreary^  j^et  fruitful 
wilderness,  their  human  homes,  where  their  children  opened 
bright  eyes  upon  a  world  of  toil  and  hardship;  yet  from  the 
Solitude  of  that  remote  location  there  comes  to  us  a  grand  and 
heroic  story  of  the  building  up  of  the  kingdom  of  home,  th^ 
"meeting  house"  and  the  school. 

"And  there  were  no  ancient  bells  to  ring, 
No  priests  to  chant,  no  choirs  tO  sing,

Thomas  barber,  b.  1G14,  came  from  Eiig.  in  the  "Chri§^ 
tian"  to  "good  old  Dorchester,"  Mass,,  1635.  In  the  division  of 
lots  in  Windsor,  Ct.,  he  was  granted  a  lot  and  eight  acres? 
•'the  plott  was  located  west  of  Mill  road  on  Mili-brook,  acrog^ 
t'leasant  St"  This  street,  says  Carlisle,  "was  opened  orig- 
inally to  accommodate  Barber  and  Alvord."  Mr.  Barber  m, 
Oct.  7,  16 iO,  Jane  (or  Joan).  She  is  said  to  have  been  the  first 
white  woman  to  land  in  Ct.  Doubtless  she  was  of  the  party 
Who  went  by  boat  from  Dorchester.  Mr.  Barber  was  a  Serg't 
in  the  Bequot  war,  and  distinguished  himself  in  a  battle  near 
Crotch.  Capt.  Mason  and  a  part  of  the  Co.  "had  entered  the 
fort  and  in  going  out  encountered  some  Indians.  They  fled 
and  we  pursued  them  to  the  end  of  the  laiie,"  Writes  Mason, 
"but  before  We  could  reach  them,  they  were  met  by  Thomas 
Barber  and  Edward  Patterson,  who  slew  th^  entire  seven  witli 


84  BARBOUR  FAMILIES 

their  axes  and  knives,  their  muskets  having  been  discharged." 
A  day  of  thanksgiving  was  proclaimed  in  the  colonies  when 
the  Pequot  war  was  over.  No  doubt  Thomas  Barber  and  his 
companions  shared  in  the  honor  of  the  occasion.  Gov.  Brad- 
ford paid  a  glowing  tribute  to  the  bravery  of  the  men  "who 
had  fought  in  the  Indian  wars,"  and  entreated  the  people  "to 
prefer  them  on  all  fit  occasions." 

Another  pen  picture  of  the  home  of  Mr.  Barber  is  given 
in  Stiles'  Ancient  Windsor:  "Upon  an  ancient  road  running 
abt.  s.  westerly  from  the  rivulet  near  where  the  Palisado 
Green  comes  in,  intersecting  the  Poquonoc  Road  above  the  old 
mill,  were  the  homes  of  Thos.  Barber  and  Alex  Alvord,  on  the 
south,  of  Johnathan  and  Nathan  Gillett."  Mr.  Barber  removed 
to  Simsbury  and  built  the  first  meeting  house  there,  and  was 
app.  Lieut,  of  the  first  military  Co.  or  train-band.  He  held 
various  important  positions  in  local,  religious  and  political 
life,  and  is  named  as  a  devout  and  peaceful  man.  He  and  his 
wife  d.  in  Windsor,  1662. 

Samuel  Barber,  their  fourth  ch.,  was  b.  in  Windsor,  Ct., 
Sept..  1648.  He  bought  the  homestead  of  his  bro.  John,  and  m. 
twice.  His  2nd  wife  was  Ruth,  dau.  of  John  Drake,  and  wife 
Mary  Weston,  of  Windsor.  The  Drake  ancestry  can  be  traced 
from  many  of  the  most  honorable  and  ancient  families  of 
Eng.  The  family  of  Drake,  says  Stiles,  "has  been  distinguished 
by  a  long  array  of  noble-men,  soldiers,  navigators,  clergymen, 
authors  and  martyrs."  The  Esher  Drakes  of  Ashe  were  Puri- 
tans. Sir  Francis  Drake  was  also  a  noncomformist.  John

line  is  traced  through  successive  generations  to  John  Drake, 
who  m.  Hannah,  dau.  of  Dea.  John  Moore.  Their  son,  John 
Drake,  m.  Mary  Weston.  A  thrilling  account  of  her  miracu- 
lous escape  from  drowning  is  here  cited  t 

"Three  women,  the  wives  of  Lieut.  Filer,  John  Drake  and 
Nat'l  Lomas,  having  crossed  the  Connecticut  River  upon  a 
necessary  and  neighborly  errand  and  having  done  their  work 
they  went  for,  were  desiring  to  return  to  their  families;  the 
river  being  partly  shut  up  with  ice,  the  three  women  got  into 
a  canoe  with  Nathaniel  Eissel  and  an  Indian.  Another  canoe 
with  two  men  in  it  preceded  them,  in  case  they  should  meet 
With  any  distress,  which  indeed  came  quickly  upon  them."  As 
they  reached  the  middle  of  the  stream  the  upper  ice  floating 
down  in  huge  blocks  struck  the  canoe  and  broke  it  in  pieces. 
The  occupants  of  the  boat  were  now  left  floating  amid  the 
ice  in  the  river.  "Mr.  Bissel,  at  length  by  the  good  hand  of 
Providence,  being  gotten  upon  the  ice,  he  saw  one  of  the 
women  swimming  dow^n wards  in  the  ice;  he  watched,  and  per- 
ceiving an  open  place  some  few  rods  below,  he  took  her  up  as 
she  came  along";  the  other  women  were  rescued,  with  much 
difficulty,  by  the  two  men  in  the  canoe.  "At  length  all  got  time 
to  pause,  though  a  long  and  difficult  way  from  shore,  but  by 
getting  the  canoe  up  on  the  ice  and  carrying  one  at  a  time 
over  hazardous  places  they  did  (though  in  a  long  while)  get 
all  safe  to  shore."  "The  persons  concerned  in  the  above  nar- 
rative desired  that  the  Lord's  goodness  toward  them  be  ever 
had  in  remembrance."  (v.  Mather's  Remarkable  Providences,)

In  Hebron,  Ct.,  May  14,  1729,  occurred  the  marriage  of 
Hannah  Barbour  (David,  Sam'l,  Thos.)  and  Benjiman  Smith. 
All  attempts  to  trace  his  lineage  have  proved  futile,  by  reason 
of  the  bewildering  multitude  of  that  name.  It  is  surmised  by 
historians  that  he  came  from  Boston  or  vicinity,  and  evidently 
of  a  good  family.  They  had  eleven  sons  and  one  dau.  b.  in

Abigal  Higgins&gt;  of  Cummington,  Mass.  She  was  des.  from 
tlichard  Higgine,  who  was  one  of  the  first  volunteers  in  the 
Bequot  war;  and  was  app.  surveyor  of  Plymouth,  Mass.,  1642. 
He  came  there  in  1633  and  "was  of  the  Grand  In(iuest,  and  one 
of  the  town  com.  in  '47  for  the  Colonial  Court."  He  m.  Lydia, 
dau.  of  Edmund  Chandler,  who  lived  in  Duxbury,  and  repre- 
sented the  town  in  General  Court  seven  years.  "The  name 
of  Higgins  is  from  Hugonis,  of  Celtic  origin,  and  from  Barn- 
stable, Eng.,  in  1500  A.  D."  Ephraim  Smith  enlisted  in  the 
war  of  the  Revolution,  May  12,  1775,  5th  Reg't  Ct.  Vol's;  dis- 
charged Oct.  23;  re-enlisted  in  Capt.  Johnson's  Co.,  5th  Battal^ 
ion;  fought  at  ¥/hite  Plains,  and  was  of  the  number  who  were 
ordered  to  march  from  Ct.  to  aid  the  Continental  army  at 
Peekskill.  March,  1777. 

After  the  war  closed  the  attention  of  the  old  soldiers  was 


SMITH  FAMILIES  89 

ealled  to  the  glowing  reports  of  the  fertility  of  the  soil  in 
central  N.  Y.,  and  many  hastened  thither.  Among  the  number 
who  in  the  meridian  of  life  "went  up  among  the  Indians  in 
the  *Whitestown  country"  were  Ephraim  Smith  and  family, 
and  two  or  three  brothers.  They  settled  there  abt.  1793  on 
farms  purchased  from  the  government.  Aside  from  farming, 
Mr.  Smith  practiced  medicine,  and  though  not  a  graduate  of 
the  materia  medica  of  the  colleges,  he  acquired  a  local  emi- 
nence as  a  root  and  herb  doctor;  his  Camlet  cloak,  turn  keys, 
mortar  and  pestle,  "doctor  book"  and  foot-stove  are  preserved 
in  the  family,  also  the  flint-lock  pistol  and  sword  which  did 
faithful  service  in  the  patriot  war. 

Mrs.  Ephraim  Smith  d.  abt.  1819.  In  1839  Mr.  Smith  moved 
"with  a  son  to  Hov/ell,  Mich.  Although  he  had  experienced  the 
wonderful  changes  of  military  and  pioneer  life  that  mark  an 
eventful  era  in  our  country's  history^  the  long  journey  over 
found  him  the  brightest  of  the  small  company  of  travelers. 
He  d.  three  months  later,  Oct.  7,  1839,  aged  ninety-nine  years, 


*The  privations  endured  by  the  pioneers  in  the  "Whites- 
town  country"  is  fittingly  illustrated  in  the  following  pathetic 
pen-picture:  A  little  child  of  one  of  the  first  settlers  passed 
to  immortal  life  in  early  spring-time.  Melting  snows  and 
heavy  rains  had  made  it  impossible  to  reach»-the  nearest  trad- 
ing-post, some  fifteen  miles  distant;  the  mother  had  borne 
privation  and  hardships  with  the  stoicism  of  a  martyr,  "but 
the  reflection  that  her  sweet  babe  must  be  buried  without  a 
coffin  was  too  much  for  her  to  bear;  her  grief  was  partly 
assauged,  for  her  nearest  neighbor  came  brining  an  old  sleigh 
box,  which  made  a  very  decent  coffin."  (Smith's  Hist.  Oneida 
Co.)  Under  similar  circumstances  the  cradle  of  the  child  was 
converted  into  a  receptacle  for  its  precious  dust,     (ibid.)

of  the  Huron  River  they  disembarked  from  the  lake  steamer, 
placed  their  effects  in  a  flat-boat,  and  in  company  with  another 
couple,  continued  their  journey  by  propelling  the  boat  with 
young  saplings  converted  into  oars.    When  within  three  miles 
of  Ypsilanti  they  abandoned  the  boat  and  were  conveyed  to 
their  home  near  Ann  Arbor  with  an  ox  team  and    wagon, 
where  they  began  their  pioneer  life.*    The  nobility  of  her  char- 
acter endeared  the  young  wife  to  the  pioneers  of  the  county. 
Untiring  solicitude  and  watchfulness  in  her  home,  combined 


*President  Angell,  of  the  U.  of  M.,  paid  this  tribute  to  the 
pioneer  women  of  Michigan:     "I  often  hear  speakers  indul^ire 
in  eulogiums,  well  deserved,  no  doubt,  of  the  men  who  were 
pioneer  settlers  of  these  western  states.     It  is  true  their  lot 
was  often  hard  and  their  privations  many;    but  their  lives 
were  varied  and  cheerful  compared  with  those  of  their  wives 
These  were  the  real  heroines.    Often  they  had  been  reared  in 
comfortable  homes  in  N.  Y.  or  New  England,  and  had  received 
an  education  which  fitted  them  to  enjoy  intellectual  societv 
and  the  company  of  books.     But  here  they  were  doomed  to 
spend  their  days  in  their  secluded  log  cabins  in  loneliness  toil- 
ing through  long  and  weary  years  to  rear  a  family  in  industry 
virtue  and  piety,  and  so  help  the  state  of  which  we  are  «o' 
proud.    Let  the  memory  of  them  be  ever  honored  by  us  all  ai'd 
let  us  be  thankful  that  to  their  daughters  brighter  days  have 
come.—From   address   delivered   before     the     Federation     of 
Momc7i's  Cluls,  Ann  Arbor,  Mich.,  Sept.,  1901.

with  maternal  cares,  bore  heavily  upon  her  young  frame,  and 
in  a  few  years  a  new  grave  was  made,  where  the  beloved  wife 
and  mother  was  laid  to  rest.    She  died  Dec.  5,  1847. 

Mr.  Botsford  was  a  man  of  extended  erudition  for  the 
times,  and  possessed  superior  business  qualifications.  In  1835 
he  established  and  successfully  conducted  a  mercantile  house 
in  Ann  Arbor.  The  first  contract  for  furnishing  material  for 
the  U.  of  M.  was  given  him,  which  he  supplied  from  his  farm. 
Both  he  and  his  wife  were  active  members  of  the  M.  E.  chh. 
in  A.  A.  He  d.  June  6,  1853.  The  comparative  early  death  of

HENRY  HIGGINS  SMITH  (V/aitstill,  etc.),  b.  in  Utica,  N. 
Y.,  Dec.  8,  1807,  moved  from  Perry,  N.  Y.,  to  Marion,  Mich., 
1835,  bought  two  hundred  acres  of  government  land  and  re- 
turned to  N.  Y.  The  winter  of  1836  he  drove  to  Mich.,  riding 
in  a  pung  of  his  own  manufacture,  crossing  Detroit  river  on 
ice.  He  was  primarily  influential  in  the  religious  and  political 
life  of  Livingston  Co.  A  small  dwelling  at  that  time  was  the 
only  habitation  where  now  is  located  the  county-seat,  and  a 
blazed  trail  the  only  pathway  through  dense  woods  that  cov- 
ered the  ground  for  many  a  mile.  Mr.  Smith  m.  July  6,  1841, 
Matilda  Perrine  Clarke.  In  1852  he  built  a  large  frame  dwell- 
ing, which  burned  to  the  ground  abt.  fifty  years  later;  a  grove 
of  stately  pine  trees  added  to  the  beauty  of  the  handsome  lawn, 
which  was  adorned  with  rare  shrubs  and  vines.  These  were 
also  destroyed  by  the  flames. 

An  inflexible  rule  of  his  in  the  employment  of  help,  was  to 
Summarily  discharge  any  one  whom  he  found  to  be  intemper- 
ate, immoral  or  profane,  and  the  blue  laws  of  his  forbears 
were  not  more  rigidly  enforced.  His  home  was  also  a  favorite 
resting  place  for  the  Methodist  circuit  rider  of  the  county. 
Mr.  Smith  was  by  inheritance  a  Methodist.  From  the  incep- 
tion of  the  party— under  the  oaks— in  Jackson,  he  was  a 
staunch  republican.  Some  today  may  recall  the  flag  raising  in 
1862  at  his  residence.  The  flag  was  made  by  Mesdames  Smith, 
Harger,  Wing  and  Sage;  the  men  erected  the  flagstaff,  and  at 
midnight  Old  Glory  adorned  its  summit,  with  the  name  of  the 
lown  showing  bravely  in  its  radiant  folds.     This  flag  subse-

quently  became  conspicuous  in  religious  and  political  gather- 
ings. Mr.  Smith  was  remarkable  for  his  physical  strength  and 
energy.  He  bore  an  unblemished  reputation.  After  a  resi- 
dence in  Marion  of  nearly  forty  years,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Smith 
took  up  their  abode  in  Howell  (v.  illustration),  on  the  corner 
of  Court  and  Higgins  Sts.  (named  by  Mr.  Smith  in  tender 
memory  of  his  father's  mother).  He  died  May  27,  1896.  From 
his  obit,  in  a  local  paper  we  take  this  extract:  "We  here  give 
voice  to  that  tribute  of  respect  and  esteem  for  our  departed 
townsmen  held  by  those  who  are  familiar  with  the  early  growth 
of  our  county.  He  lived  an  upright,  honorable  christian  life 
and  was  a  resident  of  our  city  for  twenty-five  years,  where  he 
has  lived  in  retirement  on  a  competence  gained  in  early  life." 
He  was  buried  in  the  family  lot,  where  side  by  side  rest  the 
remains  of  three  generations  of  the  family,  each  of  whom  lived 
nearly  a  century.  Mrs.  Smith  was  the  oldest  dau.  of  Charles 
and  Gertrude  Perrine  Clarke.  She  united  with  the  Pres.  chh. 
in  Ogdensburg,  N.  Y.,  at  the  age  of  fourteen,  and  is  one  of  the 
charter  members  of  the  1st  Pres.  chh.  in  Howell,  Mich.  She  is 
a  des.  through  the  Lloyds  and  Andersons  of  N.  J.  from  the  early 
kings  of  Eng.,  France  and  Wales.  Since  the  death  of  her  hus- 
band she  continues  her  residence  in  their  home  in  Howell,

of  Daniel  and  Anna  Dickerson,  of  Vt.  He  was  b.  in  Vt.  May 
11,  1806,  d.  Oct.  4,  1884.  The  colonial  family  of  Dickenson 
(Dickerson,  Dickson)  were  famous  in  the  history  of  N.  E. 
The  name  is  traced  with  a  difference  in  orthography  through 
English,  Scot  and  Norman  to  Symon  de  Kenson,  who  was  des. 
from  Hugh  de  Kenson,  1475,  "supposed  to  belong  to  the  family 
of  Lord  Gautier  DeCaen  of  Normandy,  1066."*  Nathaniel  Dick- 
ensen,  the  immigrant  pioneer  settled  in  Wethersfield,  Ct.,  1637, 
with  wife  Anne.  They  had  ten  ch.  The  father  was  town  clerk, 
and  lived  later  in  Hadley.    He  d.  June  16,  1676.

*A  pathetic  tragedy  is  related  in  "Temple's  Hist.  North- 
field,"  Ct.,  of  his  gr.  son,  Nathaniel,  b.  in  1698.  On  April  15, 
1746,  he  went  to  the  meadow  with  a  neighbor,  on  horseback, 
to  drive  the  cattle  home  for  the  night;  the  men  were  attacked 
by  the  Indians  and  killed — a  monument  now  marks  the  scene 
of  the  fatal  event. — The  first  knowledge  of  the  murder  brought 
to  the  wife  was  when  his  body  was  borne  into  her  presence. 
"The  shock  was  so  great  that  when  a  few  months  later  their 
son  was  born,  he  grew  to  manhood  with  an  unspeakable  horror 
for  Indians  and  warfare  of  any  kind.  He  was  drafted  into  the 
army  in  1776;  when  the  officers  were  made  aware  of  the  trag-

neighbor.  Mrs,  D.  often  recalled  in  her  prosperous  years  an 
annoying  experience  with  the  green  flooring  in  her  early  home, 
"when  the  boards  would  curl  and  warp  into  long  narrow 
troughs."  From  her  mother  Mrs.  D.  inherited  a  dignified  person-

was  aiways  original,"  said  her  gr.  daughter,  "and  never  imitated 
new  ways;  and  new  ideas,  not  in  touch  with  the  old,  she  ab- 
horred." A  quaint  and  beautiful  picture  of  this  lady  appears 
on  memory's  walls,  arrayed  in  a  gown  of  soft  black  silk,  with 
a  white  lace  chemisette  crossed  over  her  bosom,  her  fair  clear 
tcut  features  adorned  with  three  well-kept  genteel  curls  on 
either  side,  and  the  coil  at  the  back  upheld  with  a  high  comb. 
iShe  was  kind,  gracious  and  noble,  and  ever  "looked  well  to  the

Copy  of  "a  deed  conveying  a  tract  of  land  on  Rhinebeck

"Att  the  Request  of  Lowrens  Oster,  Jacob  Kipp,  William  Trap- 
hagen  and  the  Rest  of  the  Inhabitants  of  the  North  Ward  in

were  lighted  to  tell  the  people  the  Revolutionary  war  was 
over — ^Dunderburg,  Mount  Taurus  and  Anthony's  Nose.  A 
legend  is  connected  with  each.  The  latter  was  named  by 
Peter  Stuyvesant — the  last  colonial  governor  of  N.  Y.  One, 
Anthony  Van  Colear,  a  trumpeter,  "by  close  attention  to  the 
wine  cellar,"  had  become  the  owner  of  a  nose  "that  for  won- 
derful size  and  gayly  polished  colour  was  a  prodigy";  as 
Anthony  was  lounging  in  Stuyvesant's  galley  on  a  scorching 
summer  day,  his  nose  caught  a  ray  from  the  sun;  the  reflec- 
tion thereof  fell  with  burning  heat  into  the  river,"  and  killed 
a  sturgeon!  The  men  pulled  the  fish  aboard,  and  declared  it 
smelled  of  sulphur.  This  event  occurred  as  they  were  sailing 
by  the  mountain  that  ever  after  bore  the  name  of  "Anthony's 
Nose."     (v.  Legends  of  the  Hudson.)

on  the  South  by  the  Creek  and  all  on  the  other  side  by  Land 
of  Col.  Henry  Beekman,  Containing  forty  and  four  acres,  two 
Quarters  and  three  Perches.  Performed  this  26  day  of  August, 
1730."    "Per  me,  Ger.  Van  Wagenen." 

Gerrit  Gerritson,  of  Wageningen,  a  Rhenish  town  in  Geld- 
erland,  settled  in  Bergen  on  the  Hudson  River  abt.  1650.  Some 
of  his  posterity  assumed  his  surname,  others  took  the  name 
of  the  town  of  his  nativity.  Hence  the  name  of  Van  Wag- 
enen. Many  corresponding  division  of  names  may  be  found 
among  the  des.  of  the  Hollanders.

Mass.  Thomas  Little,  lineal  ascendent  of  Priscilla,  came  to 
Plymouth,  Mass.,  in  1630,  and  m.  in  1633  Ann,  dau.  of  Richard 
Warren  of  the  Mayflower;  the  latter  was  one  of  the  signers  of 
the  Compact,  and  lived  in  Plymouth  until  his  death,  abt.  1628. 
"He  was  an  useful  Instrument, — bore  a  deep  share  in  the  Dif- 
ficulties and  Troubles  of  the  first  settlement,"  His  widow 
"was  a  faithful  servant  of  God,"  and  lived  up  to  the  strict 
requirements  of  the  church.  "She  died  Oct.  2,  1673,  aged  abt, 
SO."  The  name  of  John  has  been  perpetuated  in  the  Little 
family  to  the  present  era,  Ephraim  Little,  b.  1673,  was  grad. 
from  Harvard,  1695,  "was  the  fourth  settled  pastor  of  the  first 
chh,  of  Plymouth  and  the  first  minister  who  died  in  that  town. 
His  grave  is  yet  to  be  seen  on  Burial  Hill."  The  home  of 
Thomas  Little  was  for  many  years  the  only  building  on  Main 
St.  between  North  and  Middle  Sts.,  Plymouth,  (v.  Davis 
"Landmarks.")  John  Wing  and  his  wife  Deborah,  dau.  of  Rev. 
Stephen  Batchelder,  came  to  Plymouth  from  London,  Eng., 
1632,  in  the  "Wm.  and  Francis."  His  name  appears  among 
the  list  of  those  who  united  to  form  the  town  of  Sandwich.* 
(v.  Early  Settlers  of  Nantucket.) 

John  Little  Wing  moved  with  his  parents  to  New  York  from 
Mass.,  and  thence  to  Mich.    They  settled  in  Livingston  Co.  in 


*"In  Feb.,  1741,  the  people  of  Sandwich  voted  *to  have  a

again  'to  have  a  School  Mistress,'  and  Jedediah  Wing — who 
m.  1734  Elizabeth  Gifford — to  be  the  man  to  provide  her  in

1835.  After  his  marriage  with  Olivia  F.  Smith  they  continued 
their  residence  in  Marion  until  1855.  His  father.  Barker  Wing, 
was  an  inventor  of  note,  deeply  interested  in  perpetual  mo- 
tion, and  successful  in  his  undertakings  in  the  line  of  inven- 
tions. He  is  buried  in  the  cemetery  near  Howell.  Mr.  and 
Mrs,  J.  L.  Wing  moved  to  Garnavillo,  Iowa,  1855,  and  to 
Strawberry  Point  in  1861.  He  d.  in  that  town,  Jan.  10,  1898, 
aged  85  yrs.  In  early  life  he  was  a  shoemaker,  and  by  consci- 
entious, legitimate  work  built  up  a  large  trade.  In  his  obit- 
uary appears  the  following:  "Time  has  touched  the  cheeks 
of  his  wife,  dimmed  the  eye,  scattered  the  frosts  of  many 
winters  on  her  head,  but  has  not  quenched  the  love  of  her 
heart  for  him  with  whom  she  has  spent  sixty  years  of  happy 
wedded  life.  Mr.  Wing  had  been  an  invalid  many  years,  the 
end  came  peacefully  5:20  p.  m.  Monday."  "And  so  he  giveth 
his  beloved  sleep."  "His  only  sister,  Mrs.  Mercy  Lyon,  aged 
92,  was  present  at  the  funeral."  Mrs.  Wing's  personality 
"shows  that  strain  of  moral  and  religious  integrity  that  dis- 
tinguishes the  family,  and  made  many  of  her  ancestors  staunch 
and  deserving  citizens"  of  the  colonies.    Their  ch.r

home,  Friday  morning,  April  28,  1899,  Susan,  wife  of  Geo.  H. 
Scofield. — Mrs.  Scofield  was  a  most  excellent  wife  and  mother; 
kind,  generous  and  considerate  in  all  things.  She  was  an 
extensive  reader,  well  versed  in  literature  and  current  events. 
She  was  a  fine  conversationalist,  and  possessed  the  happy  fac- 
ulty of  making  every  one  feel  at  ease  in  her  presence.  Though 
a  loyal  adherent  to  the  Unitarian  faith,  she  took  an  active  inter- 
est in  all  religious  movements.  For  thirty-eight  years  she 
has  been  a  potent  factor  for  good  in  this  community,  and  her 
kindly,  genial  presence  will  be  sorely  missed  by  all.  She  came 
from  a  long-lived  race,  and  her  family  fondly  hoped  many 
years  of  usefulness  were  before  her,  but  early  Friday  morning 
after  an  illness  of  weeks,  while  surrounded  by  her  loved  ones, 
her  spirit  took  its  departure.  Services  were  conducted  at  the

Cli.  of  Jane  Wing  Scofield:  (1)  Frank  Horton  Scofield, 
b.  July  30,  1868,  grad.  June,  1887.  He  became  associate  editor 
of  the  St.  Pt.  Press  shortly  afterward  and  continued  his  labors 
until  his  marriage  to  Miss  Rose  Pfeiffer,  of  Fayette,  which 
occurred  Oct.  7,  1890,  when  they  settled  in  Clearmont,  Mo., 
"when  his  energies  were  directed  to  the  building  of  the  col- 
umns of  The  News."  He  remained  in  this  work  until  his  death, 
which  transpired  Dec.  13,  1895.  The  following  extracts  from 
extended  obituaries  in  The  Mail  and  The  Clearmont  News, 
respectively,  bespeak  the  lofty  character  of  this  well-beloved 
son:  "Frank  Scofield  was  a  quiet,  unassuming  boy  and  man, 
yet  of  unusual  energy  in  the  newspaper  field,  his  chosen  and 
loved  profession.  No  task  was  too  severe  for  him  to  labor  on 
his  paper,  ever  striving  to  bring  it  to  a  higher  condition  of 
excellence.  No  cause  of  right  and  justice  but  found  in  him  a 
champion.  No  interest  of  his  town  but  found  him  to  the  front 
with  judicious  consideration  to  promote  the  same  through 
the  columns  of  his  paper.  His  record  as  a  newspaper  man  is 
unsullied;  he  had  either  a  kind,  encouraging  word  to  give 
or  kept  silence.  His  short  life  history  is  one  of  integrity, 
honesty  and  honor.  The  sad  news  of  his  death  fell  like  a 
pall  over  the  hearts  of  those  who  had  known  him  as  a  boy, 
scholar,  workman  and  business  man.  No  words  but  those  of 
praise  for  his  many  manly  qualities  were  said,  and  these  were 

on  every  lip."     *     *     *

objects  of  emulation;  yet  how  often  does  some  fatal  event 
reveal  that  at  his  own  side  has  lived  and  moved  a  hero  of 
untainted  color  and  invincible  courage.  In  the  life  of  Frank 
N.  Scofield  we  find  evidence  of  every  manly  motive  sheathed 
in  the  invulnerable  shield  of  honor,  honesty  and  integrity. 
We  find  a  character  that  from  the  midst  of  life's  adversities 
appears  pure  and  unspotted.  We  find  a  man  who  by  his  own 
heroic  efforts  made  himself  what  he  was.  With  untiring 
energy,  concentration  of  purpose  and  unflinching  determina- 
tion he  has  with  the  weapons  of  unconditional  truth  and  mor- 
ality accomplished  a  success,  which  would  have  been  impos- 
sible to  one  of  less  integrity  and  heroism.     There  has  never 

been  a  question  of  morality  and  purity  that  the  pen  of  Frank 
H.  Scofield  did  not  appear  on  the  side  of  right,  truth  and 
justice.  The  announcement  of  his  death  this  morning  brought 
tears  of  affectionate  sorrow  from  many  eyes  and  words  fail 
to  express  their  deep  grief  and  regard,"  "To  live  in  the  hearts 
of  those  we  leave  behind  is  not  to  die."  He  left  a  widow  and 
one  child,  Glenn  Douglas,  b.  Jan.  15,  1894.

From  the  time  of  his  arrival  in  Plymouth  to  his  death  he  was 
continually  in  office,  as  assistant.  President  of  the  Council  or 
Governor.  He  was  Commissioner  of  the  United  Colonies  for 
twelve  years.  "His  administration  was  rendered  illustrious," 
says  Dudley,  "by  his  earnest  efforts  to  introduce  free  schools 
in  the  colony."  "He  came  from  a  family  ranking  among  the 
gentry."  (v.  American  Heraldica.)  And  m.  1st,  Patience

1792.  At  the  time  of  their  marriage  the  trend  of  migration 
was  westward.  "Mr.  and  Mrs.  S.  moved  to  Ohio,  and  after  a 
brief  sojourn  there,  removed  to  Marion,  Livingston  Co.,  Mich.," 
on  a  farm  contiguous  to  that  of  his  cousin,  H.  H.  Smith.  In 
1863  he  sold  his  farm  and  after  a  few  years'  residence  in  Co- 
hoctah,  failing  health  forbade  further  manual  labor.  From 
1868  to  the  time  of  his  death  he  was  a  resident  of  Howell. 
At  the  age  of  seventeen  Mr.  Smith  acknowledged  his  faith  in 
Christianity  and  united  with  the  Baptist  chh.  in  his  early 
home,  where  for  many  years  his  rich,  clear  voice  led  the 
church  choir.    "He  was  always  active  in  chh.  work  and  his

pure,  upright  life  commanded  the  respect  and  esteem  of  his 
fellow-men.  As  husband  and  father  he  was  most  dearly  be- 
loved." An  infinite  faith  in  a  glorious  resurrection  was  en- 
compassed in  the  text  chosen  by  himself  for  the  occasion  of 
his  funeral  service:  "Father,  I  will  that  they  also  whom 
thou  has  given  me  be  with  me  where  I  am."  He  died  July 
15,  1880;  services  were  conducted  by  his  pastor,  Rev.  Shana-

fidelity.  He  was  of  a  high  and  generous  nature,  and  his  coun- 
sel and  example  in  the  Bible  class,  over  which  he  presided 
for  thirty  years,  was  above  reproach.    He  died  suddenly  May

local  paper  "The  sudden  death  of  Mr.  Smith  brought  sorrow 
and  sadness  to  his  family  and  business  associates;  he  was  one 
of  nature's  noblemen,  honest,  upright  and  conscientious  in  all 
his  dealings.  His  greatest  pride  was  to  be  known  as  a  man 
to  be  trusted,  a  man  worthy  of  the  confidence  of  his  fellows.

DR.  WILLIAM  HUNTINGTON. 


An  Honorable  Career  Ended — In  Business  Fifty-Seven 

Years  in  Howell. 


From  the  Livingstone  Republican,  Aug.  15,  1900. 
"Dr.  Wm.  Huntington  (father  of  Mrs.  J.  D.  Smith)  died  at 
his  residence  in  this  village,  Monday  morning,  Aug.  13,  1900, 
aged  83  years.  The  death  of  Dr.  Huntington  closes  a  long  and 
useful  career.  He  died  in  the  harness.  He  began  the  practice 
of  medicine  in  Howell  in  1843,  and  for  57  years  has  been  in 
active  business.  It  is  only  since  January  that  he  has  been 
absent  from  his  office.  Although  engaged  in  active  business, 
he  has  lived  an  exemplary,  honest,  upright  life,  above  sus- 
picion even.  He  was  known  as  the  children's  friend;  that 
speaks  volumes  for  any  man.  Such  a  life  and  such  a  career 
is  an  inspiration  and  a  benediction  to  the  living.  Surely,  an 
upright  man  is  the  noblest  work  of  God.  A  life-long,  consistent 
member  of  the  Presbyterian  church,  he  passed  over  the  river 
without  a  fear. 

Dr.  Huntington  began  his  practice  when  the  saddle-bags 
were  carried  on  horseback,  and  was  the  oldest  practicing  phy- 
sician in  the  county.  He  has  been  a  part  of  the  growth  and 
development  of  Howell  and  Livingston  county  from  the  begin- 
ning.   Very  few,  if  any,  of  his  early  associates  are  left. 

In  1872,  Dr.  Huntington  formed  a  partnership  with  his  son, 
Wm.  C.  Huntington,^  under  the  firm  name  of  Dr.  Huntington  &amp; 
Son.     Dr.  Huntington  was  always  proud  of  the  fact  that  he 


SMITH  FAMILIES  119 

was  present  at  the  birth  of  the  Republican  party  "under  the 
oaks  at  Jackson"  in  1854.  He  has  since  that  time  had  a  fath- 
erly interest  in  the  party.  His  high  sense  of  honor  and  justice 
made  him  opposed  to  slavery. 

William  Huntington  was  born  January  16,  1817,  in  Sullivan 
county,  N.  Y.  As  a  young  man  he  oame  to  Michigan  in  1838, 
locating  in  Oakland  county.  He  taught  school  and  studied 
medicine,  having  conducted  the  last  district  school  in  Detroit. 
He  studied  medicine  with  Dr.  Lamb,  of  Farmington,  but  re- 
turned to  New  York  State  to  complete  his  studies.  He  located 
in  Howell  in  April,  1843,  and  with  the  exception  of  two  years 
in  California  has  been  here  ever  since.  In  1850  he  was  carried 
away  with  the  gold  craze  and  went  to  California,  over  the 
Panama  route,  but  returned  to  his  family  and  practice  in  1852. 

May  2,  1844,  Mr.  Huntington  was  married  to  Miss  Rhobe 
Tibbits,  with  whom  he  lived  happily  over  half  a  century,  their 
golden  wedding  having  been  celebrated  six  years  ago.  His 
faithful  companion  died  about  two  years  ago.  Of  a  family  of 
eleven  children,  seven  survive:  Mrs.  J.  D.  Smith,  Wm.  C. 
Huntington,  Mrs.  E.  S.  Andrews,  Miss  Harriet  L.  Huntington, 
Arthur  M.  Huntington,  Miss  Fannie  Huntington,  Mrs.  C.  M. 
Phillips." 


THE  PIONEERS. 


Extracts  from  an  interesting  paper  concerning  the  Town- 
ship of  Marion,  by  J.  D.  Smith,  "read  before  the  Pioneer  So- 
ciety at  the  court-house,  Howell,  Wednesday,  June  18,  1879:" 


Mr.  President,  Ladies  and  Gentlemen  of  the  Association:  — 

Coming,  as  my  father  did,  to  Marion  when  I  was  but  three 
years  old,  or  thirty-seven  years  ago  this  November,  it  cannot 
be  expected  that  I  shall  have,  in  the  few  years  I  am  to  trav- 
erse, a  knowledge  of  many  families,  or  of  a  very  extensive 
territory  of  land.  Of  nearly  all  the  families  and  their  mem- 
bers of  whom  I  shall  speak,  they  were  to  be  found  on  an  area 
of  country  embraced,  and  measured,  by  first  taking  your  stand 
one  mile  north  of  what  is  now  the  County  House,  situated  at 
the  center  of  the  township,  and  passing  from  thence  south 
three  miles,  and  taking  in  a  territory  in  breadth  two  miles, 
measuring  one  mile  east  and  west  from  where  the  Town  House 
now  stands.  I  may  speak  of  a  very  few  of  the  other  inhabit- 
ants of  the  town,  but,  if  so,  only  incidentally.  This  is  only  a 
small  territory,  covering  about  six  square  miles,  but  on  its 
beautiful  undulating  surface  might  have  been  builded  a  city 
with  thousands  of  inhabitants,  and  with  innumerable  commer- 
cial interests  had  not  circumstances  been  against  that:  as  it 
is,  it  is  but  a  simple  rural  district,  on  which  have  lived  and 
been  reared  some  scores  of  men  and  women. 

At  the  time  of  the  settling  of  my  father  there,  the  following 
families  I  recall  as  being  residents  of  this  little  plat  of  earth: 
First,  on  the  south,  was  the  farm  of  Thomas  Ross;  next  in 
order  that  of  E.  N.  Fairchild.    Just  east  of  Mr.  Pairchild,  and 


SMITH  FAMILIES  121 

on  the  northerly  bank  of  the  beautiful  Triangle  Lake,  was  the 
residence  of  "Uncle  Charley"  Van  Winkle,  on  the  northwestern 
boundary  of  whose  farm  lay  the  not  beautiful  Grass  Lake. 
"Uncle  Charley"  was  a  great  fisherman,  which  probably  influ- 
enced him  in  the  choice  of  this  location.    Lying  just  west  of 
Mr.  Fairchild's  farm  were  those  of  Richard  Drewry  and  John 
Bucknell.     Lying  north  was  the  farm  of  Ashel  Rust.     Then 
came,  on  the  northeast,  the  quarter-section,  "taken  up"  by  my 
uncle,  Thomas  Bush,  and  my  father.    Passing  to  one  mile  east 
of  where  the  Town  House  now  stands  was  the  farm  owned  by 
Joseph  Brown.     The  Town  House  was  the  residence  of  Wm. 
P.  Fitch.     North  of  the  Town  House  were  the  farms  of  Wm. 
Fitch,  H.  H.  Smith,  Barker  and  Hiram  Wing,  the  latter  being 
what  is  now  known  as  the  County  Farm. 

As  already  intimated,  thirty-seven  years  ago  the  first  of 
November  next,  my  father  moved,  with  his  family,  by  team, 
into  this  township,  from  near  the  city  of  Cleveland,  Ohio. 
How  he  came  to  do  so  I  do  not  now  recollect,  but  on  arriving 
here  he  stopped  for  a  time  with  Mr.  Fairchild;  and  agreeably 
with  arrangements  entered  into  with  Mr.  F.  he  lived  in  his 
house  through  the  winter  following;  that  gentleman  returning 
to  New  York  with  his  wife  and  two  daughters,  Hannah  and 
Mary — I  think  to  teach  school  in  a  village  in  the  western  part 
of  the  State.  This  was  during  what  was  for  a  long  time 
known  as  the  "hard  winter."  The  second  year  of  our  residence 
here  a  school  district  was  formed,  and  a  schoolhouse  built  on 
the  site  of  the  one  now  standing  near  the  Town  House^  and 
Mr.  Fairchild  engaged  to  teach  the  winter  school. 


122  SMITH  FAMILIES 

Soon  after  the  organization  of  the  township  a  Town  Li- 
brary was  procured;  and  as  either  Mr.  Hiram  Wing,  or  some 
one  living  in  this  part  of  the  town  was,  for  a  long  time,  elected 
clerk,  it  became  a  great  source  of  information  to  the  young 
people  of  that  school  district.  Mr.  Wing  was  a  great  reader 
himself,  and  when  he  found  a  book  he  thought  any  of  us 
ought  to  read  he  would  put  it  one  side  until  our  next  applica- 
tion for  a  book.  Well  can  I  recollect  how  Mr.  Wing  would 
sit  at  work  on  his  bench,  for  he  was  a  shoemaker,  and  ply 
the  youngster  with  questions,  and  explain  to  him  what  he  had 
failed  to  comprehend.  There  was  but  one  other  place  that  I 
could  visit  and  become  as  intensely  interested,  and  that  was 
the  workshop  of  Barker  Wing,  Hiram's  father.  The  old  gen- 
tleman was  a  genius  in  his  way,  and  was  constantly  building 
and  inventing  machines  and  machinery.  It  was  to  us  boys  a 
veritable  "curiosity  shop,"  containing  a  great  variety  of  ma- 
chines in  a  more  or  less  perfected  state;  and  we  would  spend 
hours  at  a  time  listening  to  what  he  had  to  say  of  his  inven- 
tions, and  the  reason  why  they  were  constructed  thus  and  so. 

The  people  residing  here  were  nearly  all  from  the  State  of 
New  York,  there  being  only  two  or  three  from  England;  and 
a  more  hospitable  or  neighborly  people  I  have  never  known. 
On  Christmas  every  child  in  the  settlement  was  sure  to  be 
remembered  with  a  present  from  one  and  another  of  their  own 
families,  not  only,  but  by  several  of  the  neighbors  as  well. 

How  early  churches  were  organized  I  do  not  recollect,  but 
I  know  nearly  all  were  church-going  people,  and  services  were 
held  in  the  school  house,  and  a  Sabbath  School  organized  as 


SMITH  FAMILIES  123 

long  ago  as  I  can  remember.  Every  member  of  that  commun- 
ity, I  believe,  with  not  a  single  exception,  was  contented  to 
earn  his  bread  by  the  sweat  of  his  brow;  and  the  hardest 
working  man  in  the  settlement,  as  all  acknowledged,  was  H. 
H.  Smith,  who  is  still  enjoying  the  fruits  of  his  toil. 

I  shall  never  forget  the  first  wild  bear  I  ever  ^.w,  for  he 
came  in  daylight  into  our  front  yard,  and  I,  not  knowing 
what  it  was,  called  to  grandfather  that  there  was  a  "black 
deer"  out  there;  and  I  heard  him  tell  my  father  that  it  was  the 
largest  bear  he  had  ever  seen,  and  he  was  an  old  trapper. 

In  this  township,  at  the  residence  of  David  Dickerson  in  a 
neighborhood  adjoining  ours,  was  taken  sick  with  chills 
Ephriam  Smith,  the  grandfather  of  my  father,  Mrs.  Dickerson 
and  H.  H.  Smith;  to  whose  residence  he  was  removed  and 
soon  after  died,  at  the  advanced  age  of  99  years.  He  was  an 
old  Revolutionary  hero. 

All  were  on  terms  of  equality,  and  no  petty  jealousies  crept 

in  to  mar.     The   furnishing  to  you  of  the   dry  figures  and 

minute  history  of  those  times  I  leave  for  some  older  person, 
who  had  the  ability  to  see  through  other  than  boyish  eyes.    I 

know  that  there  I  spent  the  happiest  days  of  my  life,  and 

with  that  I  am  content. 

'  Sweet  spot,  no  mountain  shadow  fell 
In  solemn  grandeur  on  thy  dells. 
Nor  dark  deep  sea  e'er  breathed  among 
Thy  hills,  its  ceaseless  billowy  song — 
But  oh!  the  birds  sang  sweeter  there. 
The  skies  were  softer  than  elsewhere, 
^».nd  bright  was  the  flowerets'  bloom. 
For  this  was  home,  my  early  home."

I  do  not  feel  that  I  can  close  without  paying  a  just  tribute 
to  the  noble  women  of  this  settlement.  Many  in  considering 
pioneer  life  are  apt  to  glorify  the  men  and  neglect  only  to 
barely  mention  those  who  bore  equally  and  as  bravely  their 
part  in  the  changing  of  the  wilderness  to  the  beautifully  im- 
proved country.  No  women  of  any  community  ever  discharged 
their  whole  duty  as  wives,  mothers  and  neighbors  more  cheer- 
fully, promptly  and  faithfully  than  did  Mrs.  Jane  VanWinkle, 
Jane  Ross,  Eliza  Fairchild,  Mary  Ann  Fitch,  Matilda  Smith, 
Sophia  \ving,  Rosa  Brown,  and  Lucy  Dickerson.  This  is  at- 
tested by  the  pleasant  homes  they  helped  to  provide,  as  well 
as  by  the  genuine  men  and  women  they  reared.  It  is  a  note- 
worthy fact  that  Mrs.  Jane  VanWinkle  "brought  up"  a  large 
family  of  children,  every  one  of  whom,  on  attaining  man  and 
womanhood,  were  members  of  christian  churches,  and  one  has 
proved  a  very  successful  minister  of  the  gospel.  Indeed,  if 
called  upon  to  furnish  examples  of  those  who  possessed  pre- 
eminently all  the  wifely,  motherly  and  neighborly  qualities,  I 
could  safely  point  to  the  women  who  have  just  been  named; 
but  of  whose  good  deeds  I  have  not  now  time  to  particularize. 
They  are  and  ever  will  be  enshrined  in  the  hearts  of  those  for 
whom  they  have  spent  lives  of  toil  and  deprivations.  Blest  be 
their  memory   forever." 

Two  hundred    and    fifty    soldiers    by    the    name  of    Smith 
fought  in  the  patriot  army  of  the  Revolution.

ANCESTRY  OF  MARY  HOWELL -CLARKE 


'The  glory  of  children  are  their  fathers." — Proverbs  xvil. 


The  name  of  Howell  is  doubtless  of  Welsh  origin,  and  may 
be  traced  to  an  early  and  beloved  law-maker,  Hywel  Dda 
("Howel  the  Good")  of  Wales,  800,  A.  D. 

The  ascendants  of  Mary  Howell,  wife  of  Benj.  Clarke,  Jr., 
begin  in  this  work  with  William  Howell,  Buckingham,  Eng. 
His  son  Edward  was  baptized  July  22,  1584;  Frances,  first  wife 
of  Edward,  died  in  England.

EDWARD  HOWELL— says  Sir  Edmund  Burke— "was  the 
owner  of  the  manor  of  Westbury  in  March  county,  Bucking- 
ham, which  he  sold  prior  to  his  departure  for  America."  This 
manor-house  is  yet  standing  there.  Crest  of  the  family,  a 
steel  helmet  in  profile;  Motto,  "Tenax  propositi."  Upon  his 
arrival  in  Mass.  colony  he  located  in  Lynn,  "Anno  Dom.  1638, 
where  he  was  granted  five  hundred  acres  of  land";  which  he 
sold  and  removed  to  Southampton,  L.  L  He  was  one  of  the 
number  who  purchased  a  sloop  in  Boston,  for  the  purpose  of 
transporting  to  So.  Hampton  their  families  and  goods,  and  was 
one  of  the  founders  of  that  town.  (Colonial  Hist.  N.  Y.,  Vol.  3.) 
James  Farret  made  a  conveyance  of  land  "from  sea  to  sea 
between  Peaconeck  and  Montauk  to  Edward  Howell  &amp;  Co., 
June  12,  1639."     Lord  Sterling  also  made  an  agreement  with

At  an  early  period  in  the  Christian  era  the  title  Clericus 
(Clerke,  Clarke)  was  given^to  religious  instructors;  thus  the 
patronymic  of  Clarke  is  obviously  of  great  antiquity,  taking 
its  origin  in  common  with  others  from  an  hereditary  calling.

"March  28,  1749,  His  Excellency,  the  Governor  of  the  Col-

On  the  night  of  "the  great  and  decisive  battle  of  Trenton," 
Dec.  26,  1776,  when  Washington,  with  a  vast  army  of  men 
were  passing  by,  Mr.  Clarke  gave  the  use  of  his  house  to 
wounded  and  exhausted  soldiers;  the  floors  were  soon  covered 
with  sleeping  men,  and  while  watching  from  the  window  the 
movements  of  the  passing  army,  Mr.  Clarke  undertook  to  hang 
his  watch  in  its  accustomed  place  over  the  mantel,  when  he 
fell  into  the  open  grate  of  burning  coals.  His  condition  was 
quickly  discovered  by  his  negro  servant.  Death  came  instantly 
and  the  house  was  burned  to  the  ground  the  same  night.  The 
table  was  set  for  tea,  and  the  silver  tea  service,  forks  and 
spoons  were  stolen  and  carried  a  short  distance^  when  the 
thief,  fearing  discovery,  threw  the  pieces  in  a  fence  corner, 
where  they  were  found  bent  into  various  shapes.  Some  of 
these  relics  are  preserved  in  the  family.  Mr.  Clarke  was 
eighty  years  old  when  he  died.  He  was  buried  by  his  wife

of  Hunterdon  Co.     Tradition  gives  him  the  title  of  Capt.  in 
the  patriot  army. 

An  interesting  incident  is  recorded  in  "Raum's  History  of 
Trenton,"  which  occurred  on  one  of  those  troublous  days.  "A 
detachment  of  the  British  that  were  in  Princeton  marched  to 
Trenton  in  pursuit  of  the  American  army,  and  went  up  the 
Scotch  Road  as  far  as  Mr.  Benj.  Clarke's  and  enquired  which 
route  Gen.  Washington  had  taken;  being  told  he  had  gone  up 
the  river  road  with  his  prisoners,  they  compelled  John  Clarke^

JULIA  ANNE  CLARKE  (Chas.,  Benj.,  etc.),  b.  Feb.  29, 
1824,  m.  Dexter  White  of  Northville,  at  her  father's  house  in 
Howell,  Oct.  9,  1844.  They  settled  on  the  Colonel  White  home- 
stead near  Northville,  where  her  death  occurred  Feb.  24, 
1864.  A  contemporary  paper  contains  this  tribute:  "After 
she  had  given  to  her  husband  and  children  her  dying  counsel, 
she  bade  them  an  affectionate  adieu,  and  with  triumphant 
faith  in  the  Savior  she  passed  away  saying,  'There  is  no  pain 
in  this  death.  I  am  so  happy,  so  happy.'  In  her  death  society 
has  lost  a  bright  ornament,  the  Sunday  School  a  faithful 
teacher,  the  church  a  worthy  member,  but  the  family  are 
most  sorely  bereaved."  Her  amiable  disposition  and  un- 
bounded hospitality  made  her  home  the  center  of  attraction 
among  those  who  were  bound  to  her  by  ties  of  kinship;  but 
in  the  family  circle  she  displayed  the  most  exquisite  tender- 
ness and  affection  for  those  she  held  most  dear.  She  was  a 
leading  member  of  the  Baptist  chh.  in  Northville.  Dexter 
White  was  a  son  of  Colonel  Samuel  White  and  Amanda 
Holmes,  who  were  married  in  New  York  in  1818.  Soon  after 
their  marriage  they  settled  in  Wayne  Co.  in  the  Territory  of

Michigan;  Cal.  White  was  born  in  Rhode  Island  and  served 
in  the  war  of  1812;  was  app.  Lieut.  Colonel  by  the  Governor, 
at  an  early  date.  His  wife  remarked  in  her  later  years,  with 
the  lofty  pride  of  the  Spartan  mother,  "I  have  given  to  the 
world  three  noble  men."  These  few  words  are  a  keynote  to 
her  womanly  character,  her  intelligence  and  moral  worth. 
Col,  White  was  of  a  stern  and  noble  nature,  tall,  erect  and 
commanding.  They  held  an  honored  and  established  position 
among  their  contemporaries,  and  their  children  formed  ex- 
cellent matrimonial  alliances.  Their  posterity  are  among  the 
number  to  whom  is  bequeathed  the  magnificent  heritage  of  a 
long  line  of  honored  ancestry.

The  following  is  a  copy  of  a  most  loyal  love  letter,  from  a

"Dear  Miss  : — I  improve  a  few  moments  this  evening 

in  writing  a  few  lines  to  you.  I  am  usually  well  and  so  are 
the  peopie  generally.  I  received  your  letter  of  February  the 
nineteenth  and  pleased  was  I  to  hear  from  you.  I  have  had 
a  good  many  thoughts  upon  the  subject  upon  which  you  and 
I  had  some  chat  before  you  left  here.  As  it  may  be  of  some 
interest  to  you  I  will  mention  some  of  them  here.  First,  Am 
I  to  be  your  husband?  Are  you  the  one  that  is  to  leave  your 
kindred  and  lean  upon  my  arm  as  your  only  earthly  stay? 
Are  you  to  give  me  your  Heart  and  hand  as  the  richest  offer- 
ing of  your  affection?  Are  you  the  one  that  is  to  agree  to  go 
with   me,   come   life's  bright  weal,  or   life's   dark   woe,   until

one  how  am  I  to  conduct  myself  in  order  that  our  home  may 
be  a  home  of  happiness.  Are  you  to  weep  tears  from  an 
aching  Spirit!  Tears  that  I  might  wipe  away?  I  trust  not. 
If  I  should  be  so  happily  favored  as  to  be  united  with  you,  it 
shall  be  my  aim  and  study  to  make  our  home  one  of  peace 
and  happiness.  You  did  not  mention  in  your  letter  whether 
you  had  said  anything  to  your  Father  about  making  your 
future  home  here.  If  agreeable  to  you,  I  wish  you  would 
find  out  whether  he  is  opposed  to  your  getting  married  or  not. 
I  am  somewhat  anxious  to  know  his  mind  about  your  leaving 
home.     *     *     *

MATRIMONIAL  ADDRESS. 

TO   JAMES   B.   AND  REBECCA   CLARKE   PALMER. 

April  19tli,  1831. 
Respected    Friends: — Feeling    a  deep    interest    in    your 
welfare,  and  having  this  day  officiated  in  solemninzing  the 
marriage  covenant  between  you,  I  cheerfully  submit  for  your 
perusal  and  consideration  the  following  short  address. 

I  present  it  upon  paper,  hoping  that  by  giving  it  an  occa- 
sional perusal,  you  will  be  reminded  of  your  obligations  to 
each  other,  as  companions  in  life;  and  will  be  persuaded  to 
search  the  Bible  for  your  duty  in  that  connection.  The  new 
relations  which  you  have  formed,  brings  with  it  new  duties 
and  new  obligations.  The  station  in  which  the  husband  is 
placed,  by  this  transaction,  is  highly  responsible.  To  you. 
Sir,  is  committed  the  right  of  reasonable  control.  The  lady 
of  your  choice  has  placed  herself  with  all  her  interests  under 
your  care.  She  has  promised  you  the  obedience  due  from  a 
wife  to  a  husband.  Her  future  destiny,  in  a  great  measure, 
is  placed  in  your  hands.  What  confidence  then  must  she  have 
reposed  in  you,  and  what  must  be  the  corresponding  obligation 
on  your  part?  Her  parents  also  have  claims  upon  you.  In- 
deed, sir,  being  unacquainted  with  parental  feelings,  you  can 
form  but  inadequate  conceptions  of  the  anxiety  which  they 
must  feel  on  this  occasion.  An  anxiety,  which,  even  upon  the 
first  suspicion  of  the  formation  of  such  a  union  between  you 
and  their  daughter,  must  have  induced  them  to  examine  with 
the  severest  scrutiny,  into  your  character,  disposition  and  hab- 
its.   To  estimate  their  confidence  in  you,  which  was  requisite 


CIvARKE  FAMINES  143 

in  giving  their  consent  to  this  marriage;   look  at  the  trust 
reposed. 

Their  daughter,  with  whom  you  have  been  united,  has 
from  her  infancy,  been  an  object  of  their  affection.  They  have 
watched  over  her  in  her  childhood  and  youth,with  an  earnest 
solicitude  known  only  to  parents. 

They  have  cheerfully  employed  every  means  which  they 
thought  necessary  to  enlighten  her  youthful  understanding, 
and  incline  her  to  virtuous  habits.  For  the  preservation  of 
her  health,  the  supply  of  her  needs  and  the  defense  of  her 
character  and  reputation;  they  have  ever  been  ready  to  make 
any  sacrifice  of  ease  or  property.  They  now  commit  her  to 
your  care.  Not,  however,  to  sustain  the  relation  of  servant, 
or  of  a  child;  but  as  a  companion.  They  give  her  up  to  be 
a  partaker  of  prosperity  or  adversity,  of  comfort  or  of  afflic- 
tion in  common  with  yourself.  They  expect,  and  they  have  a 
right  to  expect,  that  your  attachment  to  her  will  be  as  great 
as  theirs,  and  that  you  will  be  as  ready  to  protect  her  and 
defend  her  as  they  have  hitherto  done.  Dear  Sir,  do  not 
disappoint  their  expectations.  Be  faithful  to  the  trust  re- 
posed in  you.  Carefully  fulfill  the  promises  you  have  made 
in  your  marriage  covenant.  Be  kind,  be  affectionate,  be  at- 
tentive to  your  companion.  And  while  with  her,  you  share  in 
the  best  wishes,  and  in  the  paternal  regard  of  those,  who 
have  so  tenderly  watched  over  her  in  her  youth;  be  careful 
that  you  ever  esteem  them  and  treat  them  as  affectionate  par- 
ents. 

The  wife,  also,  in  this  new  relation,  has  important  duties 


144  CLARKE  FAMILIES 

to  perform.  By  entering  into  the  marriage  covenant,  you, 
madam,  are  placed  under  the  protection  and  guardianship  of 
a  man  of  your  own  choosing.  Although  your  station  in  that 
covenant  is  materially  different  from  his,  yet  it  is  no  less 
responsible.  Your  relation  to  him  is  peculiarly  near.  He  ig 
affected  by  every  step  In  your  life.  No  other  person  on  earth 
can  have  the  same  bearing  upon  his  happiness,  or  his  misery. 
To  estimate  his  interest  in  the  course  you  shall  pursue,  look  at 
his  marriage  covenant.  He  receives  you  as  his  companion,  to 
the  exclusion  of  all  others.  In  whatever  company  he  appears 
you  are  his  associate  and  his  friend.  Influenced  by  this  attach- 
ment to  you,  he  engages  to  perform  all  the  duties  of  an  affec- 
tionate husband.  Your  health,  your  comfort,  and  your  happi- 
ness are  dearer  to  him  than  property  and  pleasure.  Your 
person,  your  character,  and  your  reputation,  he  is  ever  ready 
to  defend  at  any  risk.  While  he  faithfully  performs  these 
duties,  he  claims  from  you  a  corresponding  course  of  conduct. 
He  very  justly  demands  that  you  should  seek  his  interest,  his 
honor  and  his  happiness.  Cheerfully  comply  with  these  requi- 
sitions. Place  implicit  confidence  in  him.  Be  always  attentive 
to  his  requests — be  affectionate  towards  him,  and  in  the  man- 
agement of  secular  concerns  ever  yield  your  judgment  to  his. 

In  a  word,  let  each  remember  that  much  of  your  enjoyment 
in  future  life  depends  upon  a  punctual  performance  of  your 
relative  duties.  From  the  very  nature  of  the  relation  you 
have  formed,  you  must  necessarily  be  partakers  of  each  other's 
joys  and  sorrows.  Watch  over  each  other  then  for  good.  If 
you    have    occasion    to    caution    or    reprove,    let    it    be    done 


CLARKE  FAMIIvIBS  145 

in  love  and  tenderness.  Sympathize  with  the  other  in  time  of 
adversity.  When  one  suffers  aflBiction,  let  the  other  administer 
consolation.  Then  will  your  union  prove  an  invaluable  bless- 
ing. 

Finally,  permit  me  to  recommend  to  you.  as  your  unerring 
guide  and  rule  of  conduct,  THE  HOLY  BIBLE.  Receive  tha^ 
as  the  "man  of  your  counsel."  Read  it  habitually  and  at 
stated  times  in  your  family.  Study  it  diligently  and  prayer- 
fully, and  let  its  precepts  find  place  in  your  hearts  and  lives. 
Remember  that  the  Savior  demands  a  place  in  your  affections, 
before  any  earthly  friend.  He  requires  that  the  interests  of 
his  kingdom,  should  be  the  highest  object.  He  cites  you  to 
the  retributions  of  eternity.  As  an  inducement  to  obey  him, 
he  holds  forth  a  gracious  reward  in  Heaven.  Let  temporal 
happiness  then,  be  but  a  subordinate  end.  Let  your  desires 
be  after  holiness;  and  aim  at  each  other's  spiritual  improve- 
ment. Let  the  riches  gained  be  a  treasure  in  heaven.  Regu- 
late your  attachment  to  each  other  in  view  of  your  approach- 
ing separation  by  death.  Let  your  conduct  towards  each  other 
generally  be  that,  which,  upon  a  dying  bed,  can  be  recollected 
with  pleasure.  Then  will  you  rejoice  in  that  Providence  which 
has  permitted  you  to  enjoy  each  other's  society.  A  retrospect 
of  your  past  lives  will  then  soften  the  bed  of  death,  and  you 
can  take  the  hand  of  the  other  with  the  glorious  anticipation 
of  unting  with  that  soceity  above,  where  they  neither  marry 
nor  are  given  in  marriage. 

Respectfully  submitted  by  your  affectionate  friend. 

Edward  Hodge.

"William  de  la  Grande,  a  Norman  Knight,  came  in  the 
army  of  William  the  Conqueror  to  England,  1066,  A.  D.  His 
son  Ralph-Roger  became  'Grand  Porteur'  to  King  Henry  H. 
of  Eng.,  1120-1140,  and  was  the  progenitor  of  the  English  Por- 
ters." (v.  "Des.  of  Joshua  Porter.")  Twenty-two  coats  of  arms 
have  been  granted,  respectively,  to  as  many  Porter  families. — 
V.  Burke's  Landed  Gentry. 

A  quaint  old  ballad  in  "Percy's  Reliques,"  contains  these 
lines: 

"And  whan  the  cayme  to  kyng  Adlands  halle. 

Until  the   fayre  halle  yate 
They're  the   found   a  proud  porter 
Rearing  himselfe  thereatt." 

"Says,  Christ  thee  save,  thou  proud  porter; 
Says,  Christ  thee  save,  and  .see. 
Nowe  you  bee  welcome,  sayed  the  porter, 
Of  what   lands   soever   ye   bee." 

"Then   they   pulled   out  a  rynge   of  golde, 

Layed   itt  on   the   porteur' s   arme, 
And  ever  we  will  thee  proud  porter 
Thou  wilt  eay  us  no  harme."

In  1635  RICHARD  PORTER,  son  of  John  of  Weymouth^ 
Eng.,  came  to  America,  and  settled  in  Weymouth,  Mass.,

were  remembered  substantially  in  his  will.    He  d.  abt.  1689. 

A  clause  of  his  will  reads:  "All  the  rest  of  my  estate 
not  given  before  in  this  will,  I  give  and  bequeath  to  my 
son  John,  whom  I  do  make,  constitute  and  appoint  sole

SERGT.  JOHN  PORTER  (Richard),  b.  abt.  1638,  lived 
in  Weymouth  and  was  one  of  the  enterprising  men  of  the 
time.  The  records  indicate  that  he  was  a  man  of  wealth 
and  distinction.  He  was  a  member  of  the  first  chh.  and 
served  in  the  Indian  wars.  He  m.  Deliverance,  dau.  of 
Nicholas  and  Martha  Shaw  Byram,  Feb.  9,  1660.  He  d. 
Aug.  7,  1717.  His  widow  d.  in  1720.  They  had  nine  ch. 
Item  4  in  his  will  reads,  "I  give  and  bequeath  to  my  son 
Nicholas  Porter,  to  his  heirs  and  assigns  forever,  the  house 
where  he  now  dwells,  also   all  my  part  in  that  lot   where

called  Torrey's,  also  all  my  meadow  land  at  Broad  Ck)ve  in 
Bridgewater,  also  six  acres  of  land  lying  near  the  saw  mill 
in  Abington."  "Item  9,  I  give  and  bequeath  to  my  son 
Nicholas  the  other  half  of  twenty  acres  called  the  house

he  adds,  "I  do  hereby  appoint  my  well  beloved  wife  sole 
executor  of  this  my  last  will  and  testament."  (v.  "Richard 
Porter    and    His    Descendants,"    by    Joseph    Porter.)

NICHOLAS  PORTER  (John,  Richard),  b.  April  11,  1672, 
m.  Bashua,  dau.  of  Wm.  and  Esther  Thompson  Reed,  who 
was  a  descendant  of  Francis  Cooke*  of  the  Mayflower,  1620. 
Esther  Cooke,  wife  of  Francis,  came  in  the  Ann,  1623,  with 
their  ch.,  Jacob,  Jane  and  Esther  (born  in  Holland) ;  Mary 
was   b.   in   Plymouth. 


*  "The  wife  of  Francis  Cooke,"  said  Winslow,  "being  a 
Walloon  holds  communion  with  the  church  at  Plymouth,  as 
she  came  from  the  French,  to  this  day,  by  virtue  of  com- 
munion of  churches."  Francis  Cooke  was  appointed  to  lay 
out  highways  in  Plymouth;  often  served  on  jury,  commit- 
tees, and  the  Grand  Inquest;  was  one  of  the  purchasers  of 
Dartmouth,  1652.  In  1650,  Bradford  called  him  "a  very 
old  man  and  hath  seen  his  chilaren's  children  have  chil- 
dren."    He  d.  April  17,  1663.

"Captain  Miles  Standish  and  Francis  Cook  being  at 
worke  in  the  Wood  comming  home  left  their  tools  behind 
them,  but  before  they  returned  their  tooles  were  taken  by 
the  Savages.  This  coming  of  the  Savages  gave  us  occa- 
sion," says  the  writer,  "to  keep  more  strict  watch  and  to 
make  our  pieces  and  furniture  ready,  which  by  the  moys- 
ture  and  rayne  were  out  of  temper."     (v.  Mourts  Relation.) 

"The  last  will  and  testament  of  ffrancis  Cooke"  (of  "Rocky

Deeds.)  "He  sold  to  Matthew  Pratt  for  £125,  16  acres  of 
meadow  land  in  Hersey,  and  upland  bounded  s.  on  mill-dam,

confirmed  as  Captain  in  1744,  and  according  to  family  rec- 
ords removed  to  Norfolk,  Conn.  He  inherited  the  pride  and 
high  temper  of  his  paternal  ancestors,  and  any  citizen  of 
his  town — though  of  high  or  low  estate — who  stepped  aside 
from  the  path  of  rectitude,  was  sure  to  feel  the  scourge  of 
his  wrath;  but  aside  from  this  foible  he  was  a  man  of 
engaging  energy,  and  a  useful  citizen.  He  died  after  the 
year  1775;  and  left  three  sons,  one  of  whom  was  Nicholas,* 
b.  1734,  whose  Bible,  with  family  data,  is  owned  by  Homer

later  Salisbury,  Ct.    From  letters  written  by  his  son  George 


*  While  compiling  the  Richard  Porter  genealogy,  the  late 
Mr.  Joseph  Porter  failed  to  receive  the  names  of  des.  of  Daniel 
Porter  {Nicholas,  John,  Rich.)  An  old  MS.  siays:  "Nicholas, 
son  of  Daniel,  had  two  brothers,"  etc.;  their  Christian  names 
are  not  given.  The  records  of  Daniel's  posterity  given  in  this 
book,  are  all  I  have  been  able  to  obtain.  The  name  of  Eliza- 
beth as  his  wife  is  conjectural — following  a  long-established 
precedent  of  perpetuating  the  parents'  names  among  the  old- 
est ch.  Authentic  information  will  be  gladly  welcomed  by  the 
compiler. 

t  Josiah  Lounsbury — the  father  of  Rachel — was,  according 
to  family  tradition,  a  Redemptioner  from  Ireland.

we  learn  that  "He  was  a  large,  powerful  man^  of  great  en- 
durance. He  lived  in  the  time  of  the  Revolutionary  war  and 
was  a  soldier  in  the  army  a  good  part  of  the  time  for  five 
years;  came  home  a  cripple;  was  paid  in  Continental  money, 
not  worth  the  paper  on  which  it  was  written." 

His  wife  "was  a  woman  of  wonderful  power  and  ability,  a 
great  calculator"  and  gifted  with  a  spirit  of  self-sacrifice,  which 
was  called  into  action  on  many  eventful  occasions.  The  fam- 
ily located  abt.  1800  near  West  Point,  on  the  Hudson  River; 
their  residence  was  known  for  many  years  as  "The  Porter

VIII. 
STEPHEN  PORTER  (Nicholas,  Daniel,  Nich.,  etc.),  b.  in 
1778  in  Salisbury,  Ct.,  m.  abt.  1816,  Elizabeth  W.  Seeger,  a 
widow,  of  whom  it  is  written,  "she  nobly  exemplified  the 
beauty  of  a  well  ordered  life."  She  was  dau.  of  Zechariah  and 
Anna  Ostrander  Whiteman.  Mr.  Porter  was  a  soldier  in  the 
war  of  1812,  and  participated  in  the  battle  of  Sacketts  Har- 
bor. He  settled  in  Lee  Center,  Oneida  Co.,  N.  Y.,  abt.  1811. 
In  early  life  he  was  compelled  to  struggle  hard  with  fortune, 
but  the  traits  of  character  that  have  distinguished  the  Porters, 

indomitable  will,  perseverance  and  industry,  with  a  stern, 
proud  and  inflexible  nature,  were  the  handmaids  of  success. 
He  was  an  abundant  provider,  and  domestic  in  his  tastes. 
The  old  Levitical  law  obtained  in  his  family,  tempered  witb 
a  spirit  of  self-sacrifice,  worthy  of  emulation.  He  brooked  no 
discouragement  and  "never  struck  sail  to  a  fear."  His  loyalty 
to  his  mother  illumines  his  early  life.  The  ancestors  of  his 
wife  were  early  settlers  in  Duchess  Co.,  N.  Y.;  the  name  of 
Ostrander  appears  among  the  first  on  "the  list  of  the  vener- 
ated band  of  Hollanders"  who  settled  there  abt.  1714.  In  the 
same  year  a  deed  is  recorded  as  follows:  "Nov.  29,  1714, 
Henry  Beekman,  Sr..  sold  124  acres  to  William  Ostrander  and 
his  son  Peter,  the  whole  being  bounded  to  the  north  west  by  a 
hill,  to  the  north-east  by  the  lands  of  said  Beekman,  laid  out 
for  the  High  Dutcher's  in  Ryn  Beck."  (v.  Hist.  Duchess  Co., 
by  J.  H.  Smith.)  The  "High  Dutchers"  were  Palatinates  from 
Horand,  who,  presumably,  possessed  royal  privileges.     "They 


158  PORTER  FAMILIES 

werp  men  who  had  attained  a  high  and  lofty  intellectual  ele- 
vation." and  came  there  to  maintain  religious  freedom  of 
thought  and  action. 

Anna  Ostrander  was  a  gr.-dau.  of  Wm.  Ostrander  men- 
tioned  in  the  deed.  His  sons  were  Peter,  Arent  and  Adam. 
She  d.  in  Lee  Center,  N.  Y.,  Feb.  15,  1840.  (Relics  from  family 
of  Ostrander  are  in  the  home  of  the  writer.)  Her  dau.  Eliza- 
beth became  the  wife  of  Stephen  Porter,  1816,  and  d.  abt.  1850. 
Mr.  Porter  d.  Aug.,  1863.  His  will  divided  his  estate  between 
their  two  ch.  One-third  to  Rachel,*  who  m.  Geo.  C.  Savery,  and 
two-thirds  to  Jane,  who  m.  Thomas  McChesney  of  N.  J.  To 
the  latter  were  born  two  dau's.,  Jeanette,  b.  1853,  and  Ella, 
b.  1855. 

Jeanette  McChesney,  b.  Dec.  3,  1853,  was  adopted  by  her 
mother's  cousin,  Harriett  Porter  Barnett,  of  Winemac,  Ind. 
She  m.  1st  Henry  P.  Rowan,  Jr.,  Aug.  25,  1873 — a  gentleman 
who  was  highly  esteemed  for  his  elevated  character — b.  in 
Winemac,  1846,  d.  June,  1879.  His  father,  H.  P.  Rowan,  Sr., 
was  one  of  the  first  settlers  of  Winemac,  and  was  b.  in  Ken- 
tucky, May  24,  1820,  moved  to  Ind.  with  his  parents,  Daniel 
and  Nancy  Peters  Rowan,  when  a  child.  Daniel  Rowan  d.  in 
1829.  "H.  P.  Rowan,  Sr.,  became  one  of  the  leading  merchants 
of  Vv^lnomac,  and  was  an  energetic  and  popular  citizen.  He

"Grandmother,"  said  Mrs.  Alma  Wright,  "was  a  woman  of 
rare  worth  and  ability,  and  such  was  the  purity  and  beauty  of 
her  character,  no  one  could  meet  or  much  less  know  her  with- 
out being  profoundly  impressed,  and  inspired  to  live  a  better 
and  higher  life."  She  d.  in  1864  in  their  home  in  Pittsford, 
N.  Y.  As  did  his  brothers,  Mr.  Porter  began  single-handed  the 
fight  with  fortune;  as  did  they,  he  inherited  the  traits  of 
character  and  high  worth  of  his  forbears,  with  a  most  tender 
and  generous  nature.  He  early  "saved  money,  bought  land, 
and  married  a  good  wife";  land  values  increased  and,  with 
wise  investments,  he  became  a  man  of  multiplied  resources. 
"He  possessed  a  strong  constitution,  combined  with  great  in- 
tellectual vigor."  As  age  advanced  the  infirmity  of  deafness 
caused  him  to  retire  from  society  to  the  dear  company  of 
books;  his  favorites  were  Homer,  Milton,  and  the  Bible.  So 
retentive  was  his  memory  he  could  recite  without  error  page 
upon  page  from  these  masterpieces.  The  clear,  beautiful  chi- 
rography  and  pure  composition  of  his  letters^  written  at  the 
age  of  ninety,  to  his  niece  in  Michigan,  are  a  proof  of  his 
wonderful  vitality  and  strength  of  character,  as  well  as  of  his 
generous  nature.  He  was  a  rich  and  beneficent  man  for  the 
times;  his  faith  in  his  Creator  was  unbounded.  He  d.  at  the

Capt.  Savery  and  wife  were  m.  Jan.  1,  1809.  In  his  younger 
days  lie  taught  school;  later  his  clearness  of  vision  and  un- 
blemished reputation  served  him  well  as  commander  of  mer- 
chant vessels  or  sloops,  that  sailed  to  the  West  Indies  for 
sugar,  molasses,  coffee  and  tropical  fruits.  Besides  the  sloops 
mentioned  in  the  extracts  from  his  log-book,  he  commanded 
"The  Royal  George"  and  "Lafayette."  Meeting  with  disas- 
trous failure  in  the  loss  of  two  vessels,  abt.  1835,  he  sailed 
the  seas  no  more.  The  only  remaining  log-book  kept  by  him 
is  an  example  of  clear  chirography  and  accurate  work.  The 
patriarchal  custom  of  blessing  their  young  kindred  obtained 
in  this  family,  the  holy  benediction  of  this  aged  grandsire  la 
one  of  life's  precious  memories.  He  died  Aug.  28,  1872,  aged 
86  yrs.  His  wife  was  the  eldest  child  of  a  family  of  twelve. 
Her  father,  Geo.  Cornish,  was  a  Revolutionary  soldier,  a  resi- 
dent of  Plymouth  Co.,  and  enlisted  in  Ct.  at  the  age  of  sixteen. 

She  became  the  mother  of  nine  dau.  and  three  sons,  and 
with  tender  affection  and  motherly  pride  she  fondly  said, 
"They  never  caused  me  to  shed  a  tear  of  sorrow."  She  pos- 
sessed a  charm  of  manner,  clearness  of  eye  and  beauty  of 
feature,  rarely  to  be  found  at  the  end  of  four-score  years.  She 
was  industrious  and  cheerful,  and  most  dearly  beloved  by  her 
large  posterity.  In  early  life  she  united  with  the  Presbyterian 
chh.  and  trained  her  children  in  the  better  way.  "She  passed 
away  as  the  sun  was  setting  that  beautiful  27  of  Feb.,  ISSO, 
aged  90  yrs."  Her  son  George  selected  for  her  funeral  dis- 
course the  text:  "Precious  in  the  sight  of  the  Lord  is  the 
death  of  his  saints,"

GEORGE  CORNISH  SAVERY  (Isaac,  Isaac,  Uriah,  Thos., 
Samuel,  Thos.),  b.  Apr.  21,  1816,  in  Rochester,  Plymouth  Co., 
Mass.,  m.  Feb.  17,  1839,  Rachel  Louise,  dau.  Stephen  and  Eliz- 
abeth'Whiteman  Porter,  in  Lee  Center,  N.  Y.  In  early  life  he 
shipped  with  his  father  as  mate  of  a  vessel,  and  had  engaged 
to  go  out  as  Capt.  for  his  uncle,  Timothy  Savery,  during  the 
coming  season,  when  a  visit  to  N.  Y.  proved  a  turning  point 
in  his  life.  He  discontinued  sea-faring  life  and  remained  in 
Oneida  Co.  until  1854.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Savery  were  close  friends 
and  neighbors,  in  Annsville,  N.  Y.,  of  "the  honored  pioneer 
minister  of  Oneida  Co.,  Samuel  R.  Shotwell,"  and  his  beloved 
wife,  Patience  Bloss  Shotwell,  and  were  baptized  by  him.  It 
was  also  their  sacred  privilege  to  minister  to  the  dying  wishes 
of  this  soldier  of  the  cross.  Among  their  dearest  friends  on 
"the  Forks"  were  the  Lillybridge,  Bloss  and  Alden  families. 
In  Dec,  1854,  they  moved  to  Webster,  Mich. 

Though  by  nature  a  pessimist,  Mrs.  Savery  was  an  example 
of  industry,  forethought  and  good  management.  In  her  youth 
she  was  known  as  "the  handsomest  girl  in  Lee,"  and  was  ad- 
mired for  her  vivacity,  intelligence  and  energy.  The  proverbs 
of  Solomon  were  exemplified  in  her  daily  life.  By  her  direc- 
tion,  shade  and  fruit  trees  were  planted  on  the  home-place, 
and  handsome  shrubbery  adorned  the  laws.  In  her  later  years 
she  was  accompanied  in  her  walks  and  drives  by  a  beautiful 
white  spitz  terrier.  After  her  death  the  poor  creature  refused 
to  be  comforted,  and  one  morning  soon  after  was  found  dead. 
Mrs.    Savery    suffered    many    years    from    paralysis,    but 


SAVERY  FAMILIES  175 

died  suddfenly  from  heart  failure,  June  29,  1886.  Text  for  ser- 
vice: "Return  unto  thy  rest,  Oh  my  soul,  for  the  Lord  hath 
dealt  bountifully  with  thee."  Mr.  Savery  died  suddenly,  Oct 
27,  1898.  This  tribute  to  his  memory  is  from  the  pen  of  Rev. 
Luther  Trowbridge,  of  Detroit:  "For  quite  a  half  century 
he  has  exemplified  the  religion  he  professed,  a  religion  of 
faith,  of  joy,  of  gladness,  of  peace  and  good- will  to  his  fellow- 
men.  His  heart  and  hand  responded  to  every  good  work.  He 
was  a  generous  supporter  of  Kalamazoo  College  and  the 
church,"  His  law  was  the  law  of  love,  when  the  giver  or 
recipient  of  a  kindly  deed,  "tears  too  tender  for  words  and  too 
powerful  for  silence"  filled  his  eyes;  this  trait  is  hereditary  In 
his  family.  He  was  borne  to  his  grave  in  the  golden  glory  of 
Autumn  by  four  grandsons.  Text  for  service  "Blessed  are 
the  dead  that  die  in  the  Lord."  They  rest  side  by  side  in  the 
family  lot  in  Forest  Lawn  cemetery.  Dexter,  Mich.  A  memor- 
ial window  perpetuates  their  fellowship  with  the  Baptist  chh. 
in  Dexter.  Their  ch.:  Stephen  P.,  Isaac  S.,  Henrietta  E., 
Henry  R.,  Oustavus  A. 


Stephen  Porter  Savery  (George,  Isaac,  Isaac,  etc.) 
(eighth  in  des.  from  Richard  Porter),  b.  in  Lee  Center^  N.  Y., 
Dec.  11,  1841,  came  to  Mich,  in  1854,  was  preparing  to  enter 
the  U.  of  M.  when  he  enlisted  as  musician  in  Co.  K,  4th  Mich. 
Vol.  Inft'y  in  1861;  was  honorably  discharged  on  account  of 
protracted  illness.  Entered  the  U.  of  M.  fall  of  1861;  the  war 
fever  was  yet  burning  in  his  veins,  and  with  a  fellow-student

he  enlisted  men,  and  with  others  organized  Battery  "H," 
Light  Artillery,  in  which  he  ranked  as  2nd  Lieut.  They 
fought  at  New  Madrid  with  success,  also  at  Holly  Springs,  and 
Davis'  Mills,  where  Gen.  Vardoun  attacked  them  with  larger 
forces,  but  was  defeated.  At  "Island  No.  10"  was  the  coup 
d'etat  in  which  he  distinguished  himself  as  a  Christian  sol- 
dier. These  citations  are  from  letters  written  by  him  during 
that  thrilling  event — and  are  corroborated  by  C.  C.  Coffin  in 
"My  Days  and  Nights  on  the  Battlefield":  "Four  miles  below 
us  is  Island  No.  10;  we  are  placed  here  to  keep  the  enemy 
from  coming  down  the  river,  they  have  30,000  men,  one  float- 
ing battery  and  three  gun  boats.  They  try  to  pass  our  fort 
every  day.  I  hear  the  men  say,  'They  are  coming  now!* 
'There  goes  a  gun  from  the  upper  'battery!  I  must  go*!' 
Later,  "we  have  had  a  fight,  they  have  retreated  up  the  river. 
I  enclose  a  sketch  of  our  position."  The  next  day  he  con- 
tinues, "My  men  are  in  the  best  of  spirits  and  ready  for  the 
fray.  The  enemy  have  been  working  all  night,  throwing  up 
entrenchments.  Just  now  everything  is  in  confusion.  There 
goes  a  gun  from  the  batteries  below!  And  there  goes  the 
rebels'  reply  from  the  other  side  of  the  river!  We  shall  have 
hot  times,  but  I  shall  come  out  all  right  with  God's  help." 
Later,  "I  received  my  commission  from  Gov.  Blair  recently 
and  will  send  it  home."  (A  promotion.)  "The  cannons  are 
firing  all  along  the  river,  it  does  not  seem  like  Sunday."  Lieut. 
Savery  ranked  as  Major,  under  Gen.  Hurlburt,  in  Memphis, 
Tenn.,  where  he  married,  Feb.  3,  1863,  Julia  P.  Foster.  (One 
ch.,  Jessie,  b.  Nov.  25^  same  year,  d.  Sept.  19,  1864.)     He  wai^ 


SAVERY  FAMILIES  177 

also  a  newspaper  correspondent.  He  d.  in  Memphis  June  25, 
1864,  of  smallpox,  and  is  buried  there.  A  cenotaph  in  the 
family  burial  place  perpetuates  his  memory. 

^'He  went  to  the  war  in  the  morning,  the  roll  of  the  drum 
could  be  heard, 

But  he  paused  at  the  gate  of  his  mother,  for  a  kiss  and  a 
comforting  word. 

He  was  full  of  the  dreams  and  ambitions  that  youth  is  so 
ready  to  weave, 

And  proud  of  the  clank  of  his  sabre,  and  the  chevrons  of  gold 
on  his  sleeve. 

With  the  heroes  who  sleep  on  the  hillside,  he  lies  with  a  flag 
at  his  head, 

But  blind  with  the  hours  of  her  weeping,  the  mother    yet 
mourns  for  her  dead. 

The  soldier  who  falls  in  the  battle,  may  feel  but  a  moment 
of  pain, 

But  the  women  who  wait  in  the  homested,  must  dwell  with 

the  ghosts  of  the  slain."

No  man  was  allowed  to  make  laws  for  aaother  until  lie 
first  became  subservient  to  the  law  of  God. 

Men  were  fined  for  Sabbath-breaking  and  profane  swearing 
'(surely  a  salutary  example  for  a  degenerate  age).  Church 
'attendance  was  compulsory  in  all  the  Colonies.  Masters  were 
'compelled  to  send  their  servants  to  "meeting,"  or  pay  a  fine. 
Churches  were  not  Warmed  In  winter  except  by  foot-stoves 
— a  small  perforated  tin  oox  framed  in  wood,  holding  a  smaller 
iron  tray — filled  with  burning  charcoal. 

The  following  notices — quaint  and  ambiguous — appeared  in 
^1666  in  a  Plymouth  Co.  church: 

"This  year  the  town  ordered  that  no  woman  or  maid  or 

*boy  shall  sit  in  the  south  or  east  Alley  of  the  meeting-house 

upon  penalty  of  twelve  pence  for  every  time  they  sit  there 

after  the  present  day,  and  every  dog  that  comes  to  the  meeting 

Pafter  the  present  day,  either  of  Lord's  Day  or  Lecture  Days, 

except  it  be  their  dogs  that  pay  for  a  dog  whipper,  the  owner 

of  those  dogs  shall  pay  six  pence  for  every  time  they  come  to 

^meeting."    In  1667,  "It  was  ordered  that  every  dog  that  comes 


182  IN  COLONIAL  DAYS 

into  the  meeting-house  shall  pay  a  six  pence  for  every  time 
he  comes." 

An  infant's  name  often  became  an  outward  symbol  of  an 
inward  emotion.  Hence,  we  find  among  the  daughters  the 
christian  appellations  of  Hope-Still,  Humility,  Yet  Mercy, 
Patience,  Experience,  Silence,  Content,  Thankful,  Desire,  De- 
liverance, Faith  and  Joy,  with  honors  fairly  divided  among 
the  sons  and  brothers  in  the  kindred  titles  of  Waitstill,  Yet- 
once,  Comfort,  Fear,  Retrieve,  Freegrace,  Freelove,  Consider, 
Hope-well,  Love-well,  Preserved,  Wrestling,  etc. 

There  were  no  idle  hands  in  the  families  of  our  forbears; 
aversion  to  labor  was  a  habit  in  which  no  one  who  properly 
estimated  the  good  opinion  of  others,  dared  indulge.  Conse- 
quently, the  extremes  of  poverty  were  rarely  evident. 

Improvident  people  became  town  charges,  and  at  an  early 
day  were  "farmed  out"  at  prices  that  varied  annually.  In 
1770  in  the  colony  of  Mass.  the  value  of  a  "poor"  woman  was 
three  lbs.  per  annum. 

When  no  epidemic  prevailed,  the  services  of  a  physician 
were  rarely  required.  There  was,  evidently,  bad  management 
in  a  household  where  the  professional  visits  of  a  doctor  were 
frequently  demanded. 

With  approaCiiiUg  Spring,  in  all  well-regulated  families,  a 
daily  dose  of  picra  or  other  curative  was  daily  administered — 
for  a  brief  season — to  each  member. 

Nearly  every  house  had  its  spinning-wheel,  dye-tub  and 
loom.  A  combination  called  "linsey-woolsey,"  prepared  from 
flax  and  wool,  was  the  vogue  for  common  wear.     Fine  "home- 


IN  COLONIAL  DAYS  183 

spun,"  linen-and-silk,  and  silk  "that  would  stand  alone," 
formed  the  material  for  the  Sunday  gown. 

Tailors  and  shoemakers  went  yearly  from  house  to  house 
and  made  for  the  men  and  boys  Sunday  suits,  and  boots  and 
shoes,  from  material  produced  on  the  farm.  The  suits  were 
often  handed  down  through  two  generations. 

The  clock-tinker,  too,  was  frequently  in  evidence. 

The  Camlet  Cloak— a  long  silk  and  wool  cape,  lined— was 
a  style  that  obtained  among  gentlemen  of  New  England,  in 
the  eighteenth  century. 

"Until  about  1750,  carriages  were  of  the  two-wheeled  vari- 
ety" and  a  rare  luxury;  "the  prevailing  mode  of  travel  for  both 
men  and  women  was  on  horseback,"  or  on  water  in  coasting 
sloops.    Hearses  came  into  use  in  the  east  about  1820. 

Pine-knots,  whale-oil  lamps  tallow  candles,  and  wax  that 
exuded  from  bar-berries,  were  the  means  utilized  for  lighting 
the  evening  hours. 

Petroleum  or  rock-oil  was  used  for  medicinal  purposes  in 
the  eighteenth  century. 

The  first  newspaper  was  the  Boston  News-Letter,  published 
first  in  1704.  The  first  printing  press  was  set  up  at  Cambridge 
in  1639.  The  first  daily  paper,  the  Federal  Orrery,  was  issued 
in  1792. 

The  old  patroons  along  the  Hudson,  followed  religiously 
the  customs  of  their  father-land.  To  them  we  owe  our 
Christmas  and  Easter  joys.  The  Puritans  of  N.  E.  disapproved 
these  holidays,  consequently  Christmas  gifts  were  rarely  ex- 
changed, and  no  "Santa  stockings"  adorned  the  chimney  cor- 
ners in  Puritan  homes.

"Up  to  1700  nearly  every  family  in  New  England  ate  from 
wooden  trenchers."  Corn-bread,  rye-cake  and  meat  were  the 
principal  articles  of  food.  Wheat  was  not  cultivated  to  any 
extent  until  after  the  Revolution.  The  potato  was  entirely 
unknown  as  an  edible  until  about  1720,  and  was  not  generally 
used  until  about  1780,  while  the  tomato  did  not  come  into  use 
as  an  article  of  food  until  the  middle  of  the  last  century. 
The  plant  was  formerly  cultivated  for  the  beauty  of  its  fruit, 
and  called  "Love-Apple." 

The  following  citation  from  Archives  of  N.  J.,  Vol.  XIV., 
is  herein  given  as  a  sample  of  the  "liners"  of  those  days. 

"Run  away  the  26th  inst.  from  James  Anderson  of  the 
township  of  Lebanon,  Hunterdon  Co.,  West  New  Jersey,  an 
Irish  servant  man  named  Jeremiah  Hinds,  aged  about  22  years^ 
about  5  foot  8  inches  high,  thin  bodied,  well  made,  has  black 
curled  hair  about  3  inches  long;  had  with  him  a  brown  coat 
with  Mohair  buttons,  a  whitish  coat  with  metal  buttons;  a 
linen  jacket,  linen  shirt  and  gray  yarn  stockings,  a  pair  of 
shoes,  new  half-soled,  a  new  Felt  Hat  and  an  old  one.  Who- 
ever takes  up  and  secures  said  Servant  so  that  his  Master 
•  may  have  him,  shall  have  Forty  Shillings  and  all  reasonable 
charges." — From  the  Neio  York  Weekly  Post  Boy,  Dec.  31, 
1744. 

"Plymouth,  Mass.,  in  1627,"  as  described  by  DeRasieres, 
Dutch  Col.  at  Manhattan.     (Copied  in  modern  style.): 

"New  Plymouth  lies  on  the  slope  of  a  hill  stretching  east 
towards  the  sea-coast  with  a  broad  street  about  a  cannon 
shot  long,   leading  down  the  hill   with  a  cross  street  in  the 


IN  COIvONIAI^  DAYS  185 

middle  going  southward  to  the  rivulet  and  northward  to  the 
land.  The  houses  are  constructed  of  hewn  planks,  with  gar- 
dens also  enclosed  behind,  and  at  the  sides  with  hewn  planks, 
so  that  their  houses  and  court  yards  are  arranged  in  very  good 
order,  with  a  stockade  against  a  sudden  attack,  and  at  the 
ends  of  the  streets  there  are  wooden  gates.  In  the  center  on 
the  cross  street  stands  the  Governor's  house,  before  which  is 
a  square  erection,  upon  which  four  pastereros  are  mounted  so 
as  to  flank  along  the  streets.  Upon  the  hill  they  have  a  large 
square  house,  with  a  flat  roof  made  of  thick  sawn  planks 
stayed  with  oak  beams,  upon  the  top  of  which  they  have  six 
cannons,  which  shoot  balls  of  four  and  five  pounds,  and  com- 
mand the  surrounding  country.  The  lower  part  of  it  they 
use  for  church,  where  they  preach  on  Sundays  and  the  usual 
holidays.  They  assemble  at  beat  of  drum,  each  with  his  mus- 
ket or  firelock  in  front  of  the  Captain's  door;  they  have  their 
cloaks  on  and  place  themselves  in  order,  three  abreast,  and 
are  led  by  a  sergeant  without  beat  of  drum.  Behind  comes 
the  Governor  in  a  long  robe;  beside  him  on  the  right  hand 
comes  the  preacher  with  his  cloak  on,  and  on  the  left  hand  the 
Captain  with  his  side  arms  and  cloak  on,  and  with  a  small 
cane  in  his  hand.  Thus  they  are  constantly  on  guard  night 
and  day." 

Extract  from  a  copy  of  a  letter  written,  presumably  Dy 
Edward  Winslow,  one  of  the  Mayflower  Pilgrims,  to  a  friend 
in  England  in  1620,  copied  verbatim  et  literatum — as  are  quite 
all  ancient  documents  in  this  book:  "Bring  good  store  of 
clothes  and  bedding  with  you,  bring  every  Man  a  Musket  or 


186  IN  COLONIAL  DAYS 

fowling  Peece,  let  your  Peece  be  long  in  the  barrel,  and  feare 
not  the  waight  of  it,  for  most  of  our  shooting  is  from  stands, 
bring  iuyce  of  Lemmons — bring  Paper  and  Linced  oyle  for 
youre  windows,  with  cotton  yarn  for  your  Lamps."     *     *     * 

(Signed)     "E.  W."  (v.  Mourt's  Relation.) 


MARRIAGE   LAW. 

"May  12,  was  ye  first  marriage  in  this  place."  v  Plymouth, 
1621,  A.  D.),  "which  according  to  laudable  customs  of  ye  new 
countries  in  which  they  had  lived,  was  thought  most  requisite 
to  be  performed  by  ye  magistrate,  as  being  a  civil  thinge 
aboute  which  many  questions  about  ye  inheritance  doe  de- 
pende,  with  other  things  most  proper  to  these  cognizans  and 
most  consonant  to  ye  scripture,  Ruth  4,  and  nowher  in  ye 
gospel  to  be  layed  on  ye  ministers  as  a  part  of  theire  office." 
(v.  Bradford  Record  and  T^g-book,  page  33.) 


''Whose  faith  follow,  considering  the  end  of  their  conver- 
sation, Jesus  Christ  the  same  yesterday  and  to-day,  and  for- 
ever:'-—Heb.  xiii.  7,  8.

"What  tho'  I  faint  and  perish,  I 
Have  that  within  me  which  is  high 
As  Heaven,  and  infinite  as  the  sky." 


\l0    yif    \k0 

"For  some  we  loved,  the  loveliest  and  the  best, 
That  from  his  Vintage  rolling  Time  hath  prest. 

Have  drunk  their  cup  a  round  or  two  before, 
And  one  by  one  crept  silently  to  rest. 

"And  we  that  now  make  merry  in  the  Room 
They  left,  and  Summer  dresses  in  new  bloom. 

Ourselves  must  we  beneath  the  Couch  of  Earth 
Descend— ourselves  to  make  a  Couch— for  whom?" 

— Rutaiyat  of  Omar  Khayyam.
