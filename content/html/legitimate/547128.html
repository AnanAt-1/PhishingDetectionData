Within two days after we met, my case was sent to the USCIS and within 45 days I received my Work Authorization and Advance Parole. Not only was Michael was swift at handling my case but he was professional and caring throughout the process. He responded quickly to my emails and the process gave me piece of mind.

                            <div class="testimonial_item_content">Great Immigration Attorney.<br>After consulting several immigration attorneys in early 2012 I discovered Michael Markovitch. I had just married overseas in December of 2011 and needed to get my wife to the states. During our first meeting it was clear the Michael was very knowledgeable of the immigration process and had answered my questions very completely and professionally. Michael warned us that the immigration procedures were very time-consuming and my wife and I were prepared for this. Once the very long process was done, we received our US Embassy interview appointment rather quickly. I flew to be with my wife. We were interviewed together by a very well-spoken and very articulate interviewer who was fluent in both our languages. After the interview the interviewer said to my wife, &quot;Welcome To America&quot;. We received her Visa in about a week. Upon arriving at JFK in New York, her info was &quot;in the system&quot; and my wife was given a cursory interview and we were FINALLY together!!!!!!! <br>Within 2 weeks my wife received her green card and within another week or so she received her SS card. My wife was settling in to our new life in America with all the documents needed. My wife found work within 6 weeks of arriving. <br>We feel that Michael was instrumental in making sure that all the T's were crossed and I's we're dotted making my wife's transition as smooth as possible. We have already recommended Michael to at least a dozen people in the same or similar situation. My wife and are very grateful to Mr. Markovitch's legal immigration representation. Thank You Michael. <br>Sincerely,</div>

I was told to discuss my situation with him since this was not going to be one of the simpler cases.  I was seeking to relocate my family from England to the United States as I had received an offer from an American financial institution to work for them in New York.  Not only did Mr. Markovitch provide me with a clear framework as to the business visa I should be focusing on, once his office prepared the case, I was most pleasantly surprised how quick the approval was received. I would definitely tell those looking for a highly qualified immigration attorney to speak to Mr. Markovitch before proceeding with their difficult immigration case.</div>

He reassured me and alleviated my fears.  To conclude, it took only four and a half months from the date our application was filed to the time we received the green card for which we were applying, and his guidance made the whole process more efficient and less stressful than it would have otherwise been.</div>

I retained the Law Offices of Michael H. Markovitch to get me permanent residence based upon my employer sponsoring me.  Mr. Markovitch spent a great deal of time and expertise to get the labor certification filed by my employer on my behalf certified after attempts by other lawyers had failed in the past. Two prior cases had been denied and I was beginning to feel that my dream to live permanently in the United states was not going to happen.  Michael Markovitchâ€™s knowledge of the laws and process finally allowed for me to get my petition and ultimately Green Card approved. I am most grateful for Michael H.

I called Mr. Markovitchâ€™s office, made an appointment and met with Mr. Markovitch.  During our first meeting, he clearly explained to me the process and he gave me a checklist listing the steps which were to be taken and which documents we needed to present to the USCIS.  Mr. Markovitch himself came with us to the interview. Within three months after filing the marriage case, I received my Green Card.  Mr. Markovitchâ€™s handling of my case took out all the nerves and apprehension I had before meeting with him.

                           Michael was great- I was converting an O-1 to a Green Card by Marriage, and Michael had the whole thing down. My wife and I never needed to worry because Michael interviewed us both, told us what the stages were, created all of the paperwork, came with us to the interviews and now today I got an email from him to say that I have a permanent green card now! Cannot recommend this man highly enough- and he's a decent guy too. I actually liked hanging out in his office.

                           When I was looking for an immigration attorney for my case, first thing that I did, was to read other people’s reviews on internet. That is how I found Michael. He had great reviews and I’m very glad I chose him. He is an extremely professional person yet easy going. He gives good advice and answers all the questions with all possible scenarios. Where there seems to be no solution, he finds it. For us immigrants, the case seems to look hopeless, but Michael, with his experience finds a solution. As a person who also works in legal field, I would highly recommend Michael.
