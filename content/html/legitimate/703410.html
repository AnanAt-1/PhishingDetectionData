<h1>Free Antivirus Software, Free Online Virus Scan</h1>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/security/antivirus.shtml" target="_top">free antivirus programs</a> listed on this
page allow you to detect computer viruses, remove or repair infected files, prevent infection, detect and remove email viruses, etc.
There are also free online virus scanning services available for those who prefer (or need to) scan for virus that way.
</p>

<p>
If your system is already infected, you may also want to take a look at the
<a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/security/antivirus-rescue-cd.shtml" target="_top">Free Antivirus Rescue CDs and DVDs</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, you should <strong>not</strong> install more than one antivirus or antimalware product on your computer.
Even if the software does not complain and all seems fine, there may be underlying conflicts that cause one or more of
the software to miss viruses and other malware. That is to say, you may end up with a system that is less secure and
more unstable than if you were simply running a single product.
</p>

<p>
If you are suspicious of a particular file that you have downloaded, you can also upload it to the
<a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/security/antivirus.shtml#onlinescanners" target="_top">free online malware scanners</a>
located on the second half of this page. Some of these online services are able to use multiple antivirus software to
scan that file, something which you normally can't do on your own computer.
</p>

<p>
For those who use Windows 10 (and even Windows 8 and 8.1), your system already comes with an
antivirus called Windows Defender, so you do not actually need to download and install any of
the programs listed here. <a href="https://www.av-comparatives.org/">Tests</a> by
third-party antivirus testers have shown that this program is comparable to (and sometimes even better
than) the top-tier commercial antivirus vendors. Just make sure that Windows Defender is enabled
on your machine and kept updated.

<h2>Free AntiVirus and AntiMalware Utilities</h2>

<dl title="Free Antivirus Utilities">

<dt><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14210/security-essentials-download">Microsoft Security Essentials</a></dt>
<dd><p>
This is a free antivirus / anti-malware tool from Microsoft that is reported to be lightweight and generally unobtrusive.
It works on Windows 7 (both 32 and 64 bit). (It doesn't support later versions of Windows because they already includes
Windows Defender, which is the version of Microsoft Security Essentials built for those system.) It handles viruses,
spyware, trojans, rootkits and other types of malware. Note: the above leads to the Security Essentials main page,
from which you can download a stub downloader, which will, in turn, download the actual antivirus software. If
you prefer to download the complete software instead of going through the intermediary
software, try the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201" target="_top">download page</a>.
(If the download page link is broken, or even the main link above, please let me know. The webmasters at Microsoft frequently
change the addresses of their pages without automatically redirecting users to the new locations.)
</p></dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/products/scanner">Microsoft Safety Scanner</a></dt>
<dd><p>
Microsoft Safety Scanner is an on-demand virus/malware scanner. That is to say, you have to run the program manually to check
your system for viruses (in contrast to "real-time" antivirus programs that automatically work in the background to
make sure no viruses enter your system). It was designed to be one of those one-time tools that you download
to check a system (for example, your friend's) that you suspect has been infected by some sort of malware. Since it
does not auto-update itself (to get the latest virus definitions), it will expire 10 days after you download it (since by
then the virus definitions built into the program would have been outdated). When that happens, simply go back to the
Microsoft website and redownload it again. (Actually, if you're scanning a friend's computer, you may prefer to
use a <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/security/antivirus-rescue-cd.shtml" target="_top">free antivirus bootable CD</a>
instead.) <strong>Important:</strong> For newcomers who are not security professionals, get a proper antivirus program, such
as one of the others listed on this page. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is NOT meant for you. You'll end up with a
false sense of security, thinking that your computer is protected.
</p></dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.avira.com/" rel="nofollow">Avira Free Antivirus</a></dt>
<dd><p>
Avira Free is a free antivirus program for Windows computers. It has a resident component that monitors file movements for signs of viruses. It
also allows you to scan your computer and repair files that have been infected. The program comes with a facility to automatically check the AntiVir website for
updates to the virus definitions and download them.
</p></dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.clamav.net/">Clam AntiVirus</a></dt>
<dd><p>
ClamAV is a free command line antivirus scanner for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux systems. You can also integrate it with
your mail server for scanning your email messages and attachments. It is able to scan inside archives like RAR archives,
Zip archives, Gzip and Bzip2 archives (that is, it has unpacking engines for those types of compressed archives).
This free antivirus program comes with source code that is released under the GNU General Public License.

before you install it. In addition, be careful about installing the Avast Online Security and Avast SafePrice extensions, since

that they are "essentially spyware" (quoting from the second linked-to article). As a precaution, this software
has been de-linked on this page, since, if true, it (and/or the programs that come with it) now becomes the very
thing that antivirus programs are supposed to guard against.]

your email address <a href="https://www.thefreecountry.com/webmaster/freeemail.shtml" target="_top">(get a free email address
here if you wish)</a> so that they can send you a licence key to activate the program.

[<strong>WARNING</strong>: be sure to read this

<p>
The AVG Anti-Virus software, from Avast, comprises a resident program that works in the background, an email scanner
(checks your email for viruses), an on-demand scanner (eg, you invoke it to scan your system), the ability to repair
certain infected files, and automatic updates of the virus definitions.
