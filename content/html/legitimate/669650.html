            <blockquote> 
              <P><em>The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new landscapes 
                but in having new eyes.</em> (Petras, 1995)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <P>How can this profound quote by Marcel Proust help all of us metaphorically 
              understand the powerful relationship of our minds, emotions, and 
              bodies to our different ways of knowing; the varied paces at which 
              we learn; and the input we need for motivation and success? As teachers, 
              we continue to search and explore new ways to design and deliver 
              instruction in order for our students to reach their learning potential, 
              starting them from where they are and moving them forward on a learning 
              continuum. But for many students, the traditional approaches to 
              learning seem limiting, and many of them feel frustrated and discouraged. 
              With the advent of studies in cognitive science and brain-based 
              learning research along with the powerful advancement of technologies, 
              we are beginning to unlock the mysteries of the human brain and 
              its possibilities. Educational research also enables us to better 
              identify learner variables that can affect a student&#146;s performance 
              (Gregory &amp; Chapman, 2002). We are starting to open our &#147;new&#148; 
              eyes. 
            <P> Our language classrooms are tapestries of the world around us. 
              Students come to us with varying ability levels, a myriad of language 
              and cultural backgrounds, an abundance of interests, and an assortment 
              of learning profiles. These students need inspiring, engaging lessons 
              that will permit them to reach their highest potential and meaningful 
              tasks that are relevant both to them and to the world in which they 
              live. They desire a supportive learning environment which promotes 
              diversity, nurtures creativity, acknowledges that they learn at 
              varied rates and in different ways, recognizes their strengths, 
              and honors everyone&#146;s work. These students need variety, choices, 
              challenges, complexity, and opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities. 
              They need to experience differentiated instructional opportunities 
              (Heacox, 2002). 
            <h3> What is Differentiated Instruction?</h3>
            <P> In a level one Spanish class, students want to find out more about 
              the countries where Spanish is spoken, so the teacher provides a 
              variety of resources (including sample texts, authentic documents, 
              and Internet sites) that students can choose from in order to gather 
              more in-depth information. In a level three Spanish class, students 
              read and create a graphic representation (mind map) of an Aztec 
              legend. Each student then chooses one other Aztec or Mayan legend 
              to read and study from the four provided by the teacher. Grouped 
              according to the legend each has chosen, students read and interpret 
              it, then demonstrate their understanding of the legend and its connection 
              to their own lives by creating a skit, designing a children&#146;s 
              book, or inventing a product of their choice that will be presented 
              to the class. 
            <P> German II students are studying the weather. The teacher creates 
              seven learning centers where students can practice various aspects 
              of the weather unit, including listening activities, a video clip 
              of a TV weather report, and German weather maps from a newspaper. 
              Students then choose four of the seven centers that best help them 
              use the weather unit and complete the activities at their chosen 
              centers. After evaluating students&#146; progress, the teacher determines 
              that one third of the class knows the vocabulary, structure and 
              culture for this unit very well and could easily perform the appropriate 
              real world functions like helping a friend pack clothes for a trip 
              to Austria. One third of the class understands most of the unit 
              and has performed most of the interpersonal and interpretive tasks 
              with just some difficulty. One third of the class is experiencing 
              a considerable degree of difficulty and needs more direct instruction 
              and concrete examples. In order to provide challenging practice 
              to all, the teacher tiers three different homework assignments from 
              the book and ancillaries. Students do the assignment that best matches 
              their readiness level. 
            <P> All of the preceding activities and strategies are examples of 
              differentiation. Differentiated instruction is a philosophy of teaching 
              and learning which recognizes that each learner is unique. Rigorous, 
              relevant, complex and flexible, differentiated instruction is a 
              response to that uniqueness. Consequently, in a differentiated classroom, 
              not every student is doing exactly the same thing in exactly the 
              same way at exactly the same time. However, differentiated instruction 
              is not merely a set of strategies and activities that challenges 
              the learner in a variety of ways, but rather a belief system that 
              proclaims that learners&#151;with all their diversity&#151;come 
              to our classes with potential ready to be tapped. Differentiation 
              is an effective way for teachers to offer meaningful instruction 
              delivered around challenging content and designed to meet the needs 
              of students at their appropriate levels and to help them achieve 
              maximum growth (Center for Advanced Student Learning, 2001). 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> A differentiated classroom offers a variety of learning options 
                to tap into different readiness levels, interests and learning 
                profiles. In a differentiated classroom the teacher uses (1) a 
                variety of ways for students to explore curriculum content, (2) 
                a variety of sense-making activities or processes through which 
                students can come to understand or &#147;own&#148; information 
                and ideas, and (3) a variety of options through which students 
                can demonstrate or exhibit what they have learned (Tomlinson, 
                1995, p. 1).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <P> When differentiated instructional strategies are used, there is 
              more access to learning by more students, more effective use of 
              time, and more evidence of motivated students. The art and science 
              of teaching emerge (Tomlinson, 1999). 
            <h3> The Core of Differentiated Instruction</h3>
            <P> In order to prepare for differentiation, sound teaching principles 
              must be honored and a quality curriculum must be in place. Applying 
              standards while designing and organizing instruction, a teacher 
              must be clear on what all students need to know, understand, and 
              be able to do at the end of the unit. The teacher is familiar with 
              student differences that affect the unit and builds on these differences, 
              making adjustments in the <em>content</em> of the unit, the multiple 
              ways students <em>process</em> the content, and the various <em>products</em> 
              they create in order to demonstrate what they have learned. For 
              example, a pre-test or a questionnaire can be used to check for 
              prior knowledge of the content, student reflective logs can be examined 
              to check for previous challenges, past grades can be used to determine 
              progress and readiness levels, a multiple intelligences checklist 
              can be administered to check for varied learning profiles, or an 
              inventory can be taken to determine interests. To enhance learning 
              for all students, the goals of differentiated instruction include: 
              establishing a balance between a student-centered and teacher-facilitated 
              classroom, providing opportunities for students to work in a variety 
              of formats, developing instruction around the standards and the 
              &#147;big picture&#148; concept of the unit, designing challenging 
              and respectful tasks for all, and meeting curriculum standards and 
              requirements while maximizing student growth and individual success. 
              Differentiation is based on sound research. It puts the learning 
              needs of students at the center of instructional design (Tomlinson, 
              1999). 
            <h3> Differentiating Curricular Elements</h3>
            <P> Differentiated instruction usually implies modifications or variations 
              in response to student needs in one or more of the following areas: 
              content, process or product. 
            <h4> Content</h4>
            <P> Content refers to the &#147;input&#148; of the unit: ideas, concepts, 
              information and facts. It is what the student must know and understand 
              as a result of the lesson. Content is differentiated by focusing 
              on the unit&#146;s most relevant and essential components and varying 
              them to meet learners&#146; needs by providing them choices. For 
              example, if some students need more time to grasp the essential 
              skills needed for the unit, the teacher might provide them more 
              direct instruction, more concrete examples and practice. Other students 
              may quickly understand the concepts and need to be challenged by 
              more complex activities (Berger, 1991). 
            <P> Content can also be modified by providing a variety of texts: 
              simpler or more advanced, authentic documents or adapted ones, electronic 
              or print&#151;or simply a variety of text types such as brochures, 
              music, film, field trips, guest speakers, Total Physical Response 
              Storytelling,&#151;etc. A learning center&#151;a classroom area 
              containing a collection of materials or activities designed to teach, 
              reinforce, or extend a particular concept or skill (Center for Advanced 
              Student Learning, 2001)&#151;can be used to differentiate for content.

              (<a href="n06f1a.html" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('n06f1a.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=500'); MyWindow.focus(); return false;">Figure 
              1</a>) is one such example in which students gain background knowledge 
              of a story&#146;s setting, the historical and cultural perspectives 
              in which it takes place, and the biographical background of the 
              author. 
            <h4> Process</h4>
            <P> Process refers to the ways students make their own sense of the 
              content or input. Process is the how of teaching. <A NAME="1a"></A>To 
              modify the process, the teacher can apply a variety of flexible 
              grouping strategies such as ability grouping, interest grouping, 
              or grouping by learning profile. Gardner&#146;s Multiple Intelligences 
              Theory<SUP><A HREF="#1">1</A></SUP> (Lazear, 2000), for example, 
              can be used in designing instruction by attending to learners&#146; 
              different intelligences profiles. For example, in designing a unit 
              around sports activities, a teacher could find reading selections 
              about three different sports. In differentiating based on multiple 
              intelligences theory, one group might practice demonstrating a sport 
              from the target culture as a kinesthetic option, whereas another 
              group could collaborate on designing a poster with the rules for 
              the sport as a visual-spatial option. Yet another group could develop 
              a presentation or report on a sport, thus touching on the verbal-linguistic 
              intelligence (Theisen, 1997). 
            <P> Process can also be differentiated by modifying the complexity 
              or abstractness of tasks and by engaging students in critical and 
              creative thinking. Other options include choice boards /menus, a 
              differentiated strategy that provides options for learners to practice 
              skills, try new products, and work with a variety of resources as 
              they learn. The Tic-Tac-Toe menu (<a href="#" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('n06f2.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=440,height=560'); MyWindow.focus(); return false;">Figure 
              2</a>) is an example of a skills-based set of practice options from 
              which learners can choose in order to make sense of the structure 
              section of a unit on the family. There are opportunities to practice 
              questions, necessary verbs to enhance the topic, or vocabulary to 
              support the unit. The students make three choices according to the 
              contract. Having the autonomy to select what to do or how to do 
              it gives them more responsibility and accountability for their learning 
              because they must manage their time and select the options that 
              will help them reach their full potential. From the teacher&#146;s 
              perspective, the sophistication of menu creation follows a continuum 
              from those that differentiate solely for when students choose to 
              do the tasks to those that provide choices in the what and/or the 
              how (Center for Advanced Student Learning, 2001). 
            <h4> Product</h4>
            <P><A NAME="2a"></a>A product is the output of the unit or the ways 
              that students demonstrate or exhibit their understanding of the 
              content. Both Bloom&#146;s Taxonomy<SUP><A HREF="#1">2</A></SUP> 
              (Heacox, 2002) and Gardner&#146;s theory of Multiple Intelligences 
              (Lazear, 2000) can be applied to the differentiation of products, 
              providing greater challenge and variety in how students show what 
              they have understood. Possibilities for varying products include 
              role-plays, multimedia presentations, brochures, plays, songs, graphic 
              organizers, posters, research papers, essays, news broadcasts, varied 
              homework assignments and tests, stories, videos and R.A.F.T. (role, 
              audience, format, topic) writing assignments, etc. 
            <P> <a href="#" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('n06f3.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=660,height=460'); MyWindow.focus(); return false;">Figure 
              3</a> illustrates a R.A.F.T assignment, a system for making sure 
              students understand their role as writer, their audience, the format 
              of their work, and the expected content of their writing. It is 
              designed around unit objectives and standards and also provides 
              an easy, meaningful way to incorporate writing into content-area 
              instruction. Practically all R.A.F.T. assignments are written from 
              a viewpoint other than that of a student, to an audience other than 
              the teacher, and in a form other than the standard essay. Four key 
              ingredients are included in every R.A.F.T. writing assignment: 
            <ul>
              <p> <strong>R</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Role of Writer (Who are you?)<br>
                <strong>A</strong>: &nbsp;Audience (To whom is this written?)<br>
                <strong>F</strong>: &nbsp;Format (What form will it take?)<br>
                <strong>T</strong>: &nbsp;Topic + strong verb (What is your topic?)</p
            >
            </ul>
            <P> <a href="#" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('n06f3.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=660,height=460'); MyWindow.focus(); return false;">Figure 
              3</a> provides samples of writing assignments students can choose 
              from to demonstrate their understanding of the unit, Traveling in 
              France. Learners select one row and create that written &#147;product.&#148; 
              The teacher can set word limits or decide the format: word-processed, 
              a hand-written card, student choice, etc. What makes the R.A.F.T. 
              such a popular activity with students is the variety and creativity 
              involved. For each of these writing tasks the same scoring rubric 
              can be used regardless of which row is selected, thus making it 
              easier for the teacher. 
            <h3> Differentiating for Student Traits</h3>
            <P> Students connect better in their learning when their readiness 
              level, interests, and/or learning profiles have been respected and 
              valued (Gregory &amp; Chapman, 2002). 
            <h4> Readiness</h4>
            <P> Teachers can differentiate for readiness by tiering or constructing 
              tasks at varying degrees of difficulty and by making the task more 
              or less familiar or complex based on the ability level of the learner. 
              A tiered lesson or set of activities is a differentiation strategy 
              that addresses certain standards, key concepts, and generalizations 
              but allows several pathways for students to arrive at an understanding 
              of these components based on their interests, readiness, or learning 
              profiles. Tiered assignments focus on the same essential skills 
              and understandings for all students&#151;but at different levels 
              of complexity, abstractness, and open-endedness. The tiered assignment 
              in <a href="#" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('n06f4.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=775,height=570'); MyWindow.focus(); return false;">Figure 
              4</a> demonstrates how a product can be tiered for readiness. After 
              gauging learners&#146; readiness based on previous activities, homework 
              assignments, quizzes, and tests, the teacher assigns students to 
              one of three groups that best matches their ability level. All three 
              assignments are evaluated using the same set of rubrics, thus making 
              the assignments equitable and appropriately challenging to all. 
            <h4> Interests</h4>
            <P> In order to meet learners&#146; diverse interests, the teacher 
              can align key understandings of the unit with topics that intrigue 
              students, encourage investigation, and give them a choice of products 
              or tasks, including student-designed options. <a href="#" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('n06f1a.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=500'); MyWindow.focus(); return false;">Figure 
              1</a>, <em>Learning Centers for Exploring Literature</em>, demonstrates 
              how content can be differentiated by interest. Each of the centers 
              is designed so that students interact with different types of materials 
              in order to explore and become more knowledgeable about a piece 
              of literature. Students choose the centers that most interest them, 
              therefore resulting in a more personal connection to the content. 
            <h4> Learning Profiles</h4>
            <P> A number of variables comprise a student&#146;s learning profile 
              including the desire to work alone or in groups, preferring hands-on 
              activities over developing logical-sequencing activities such as 
              an outline, learning better when listening over viewing, and demonstrating 
              a strong musical-rhythmic intelligence. Teachers can address these 
              variables and create positive learning environments with flexible 
              learning options; a choice of both cooperative, independent, and 
              competitive learning experiences; and modification of the content, 
              process, or product to align with the different learning styles 
              of the students in the class (Center for Advanced Student Learning, 
              2001, Gregory, G. &amp; Chapman, C. 2002, and Tomlinson, C. 1995). 
              In <a href="#" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('n06f2.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=440,height=560'); MyWindow.focus(); return false;">Figure 
              2</a>, Tic-Tac-Toe, student variables are addressed by including 
              visual and musical activities as well as logical/mathematical, verbal/linguistic 
              and interpersonal activities among the choices. In <em>Learning Centers 
              for Exploring Literature</em> (<a href="#" onClick="MyWindow=window.open('n06f1a.html','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=500,height=500'); MyWindow.focus(); return false;">Figure 
              1</a>) students visit four of the six centers in order to explore 
              the content with a deeper sense of understanding. Here students 
              can view, read, respond with a graphic organizer, or listen to music. 
              When personal learning styles are addressed and more interests are 
              acknowledged, children begin to flourish, find meaning in their 
              learning, and want to engage in the process (Sizer, 1999). 
            <h3> Challenges of Differentiated Instruction</h3>
            <P> Differentiated instruction is a new way to look at each student 
              as a truly unique individual whose talents, gifts, and abilities 
              are important contributions to society. For this reason, it does 
              require additional planning time in the beginning. Some teachers 
              comment that differentiation takes too much time and, with so much 
              to do in classrooms today, it is just much easier to have everybody 
              doing the same thing (Willard-Holt, 1994). Other obstacles that 
              hinder the implementation of differentiated instruction include 
              colleagues and parents who may not understand why all learners are 
              not doing the same thing at the same time in the classroom. Some 
              may see the practice as being unfair and giving privileges and advantages 
              to certain groups. 
            <P> Moving towards the implementation of the philosophy of differentiation 
              is a long-term change process which can be prepared for by examining 
              the research and collecting anecdotal evidence from teachers who 
              are implementing it (Tomlinson, 2000). Even though differentiating 
              instruction does require some additional time and planning in the 
              beginning, there are strategies for facilitating the effort. 
            <ul>
              <li> First, form partnerships and cohort groups with colleagues. 
                Do a book study and/or try action research. These strategies offer 
                participants opportunities to learn and apply new ideas in a professional, 
                supportive setting. They promote an arena in which to problem-solve 
                as a group, construct knowledge through research, and interact 
                with new materials (Tomlinson &amp; Allan, 2000). </li>
              <li> Another strategy for implementing differentiated instruction 
                is by beginning to try one new strategy at a time. Start small 
                and remember that it is not necessary to differentiate every unit 
                and every lesson. Design two possible products based on students&#146; 
                interests or learning profiles to use as the final assessment 
                of a unit. Find three different kind of ancillary materials at 
                varying challenge levels, and decide which students will do which 
                assignment based on past performance in the classroom. For a literature 
                discussion, create a series of questions to ask students based 
                on Bloom&#146;s Taxonomy. For example, have some questions that 
                ask for facts, some that ask for comprehension or analysis, and 
                some that ask for evaluation of the piece. Engage all learners 
                by choosing students at different readiness levels to respond 
                to the different types of questions. Soon patterns emerge and 
                differentiation becomes easier and more apparent.</li>
              <li> Inform administrators and parents about differentiation and 
                invite them to observe or help.</li>
              <li> When organizing a differentiated lesson, reflect on these questions: 
                <ul>
                  <li> What are the key concepts that every student must know, 
                    understand, and be able to do?</li>
                  <li>What is being differentiated? (the content, the process, 
                    the product)</li>
                  <li>How is this lesson being differentiated? (readiness, interests, 
                    learning profile)</li>
                  <li>Why is this lesson being differentiated? (motivation, access, 
                    efficiency)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <P> As one sees the results of all students learning to their full 
              potential, it becomes harder and harder to turn back to a &#147;one-size-fits-all&#148; 
              perspective. A sense of calm, accomplishment, and joy from any student 
              is one of the greatest gifts for a teacher. 
            <h3> Conclusion</h3>
            <P> When it comes to teaching, one size does not fit all. Students 
              have different backgrounds, a range of ability levels, a variety 
              of learning profiles, and an abundance of needs. By responding to 
              these needs with a sound philosophy of differentiation, teachers 
              have more authentic interactions with their students, and students 
              are able to experience opportunities that will help them reach their 
              potential. Differentiation puts students at the center of teaching 
              and learning. It is a common-sense as well as research-based, approach 
              to meeting the diverse needs of learners while promoting equity 
              and excellence. It promotes a curriculum centered on critical thinking 
              and acknowledges the uniqueness of each learner. As Emma Goldman 
              (Petras, 1995), said, &#147;No one has yet realized the wealth of 
              sympathy, the kindness and generosity hidden in the soul of a child. 
              The effort of every true education should be to unlock that treasure.&#148;

                <p>Brainstorm a problem in your classrooms or school that might 
                  be solved by using differentiated instruction. After stating 
                  the problem, elaborate on what you need to do to respond to 
                  it. Explore how you might gather evidence of success and what 
                  you might reflect upon in order to improve the next time.</p>

              represented in traditional educational settings: verbal/linguistic 
              and mathematical/logical. The others include intrapersonal, interpersonal, 
              visual/spatial, body/kinesthetic, and musical/rhythmic. (<A HREF="#1a">back

              the level of abstraction of tasks that commonly occur in educational 
              settings. From less abstract to more, categories are knowledge, 
              comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
