HISTORY  AND  CONSTITUTION. 


FOUNDATION     AND     EARLY     HISTORY. 
McGill    University   owes    its    origin   to   a   private   endowment.      It 
was    founded    by    the    Hon.    James    McGill,    a   leading   merchant    and 
public-spirited   citizen   of   Montreal,   who   died   in    1813.     By   his   will, 
dated  January  8th,  1811,  he  bequeathed  his  property  of  Burnside  (con- 
sisting' of  46  acres  of  land  with  the  dwelling  house  and  other  build- 
ings thereon)    and  a  sum  of  £10,000  in  money  to  found  a  college  m 
a  provincial  university,  the  erection  of  which  had  already  been  pro- 
vided  for  by   the  British   Government.     The   four  trustees   appomted 
under  his  will  were   directed   to  convey  the  property  of  the  bequest 
to   the  Royal  Institution   for   the   Advancement  of  Learning,  a   body 
which     in    1802,   had  been    incorporated   by   the    Legislature    "for   the 
establishment   of   free   schools    and   the    advancement  of   learmng"    m 
the    Province   of   Quebec.     The   conditions    upon   which   the   property 
was  to  be  transferred  to  the  Royal   Institution  for  the  Advancement 
of    Learning   were,    mainly,    that    that    Institution    should,    withm    ten 
vears  after  the  testators  decease,  erect  and  establish  on  his  Burnside 
"estate   "a   University  or   College,   for   the   purposes   of   education   and 
the  advancement  of  learning  in  this  Province,"  and  that  the  college, 
or   one  of   the  colleges   in  the   University,    if  established,   should     be 
named  and  perpetually  be  known  and  distinguished  by  the  appellation 
of   McGill    College."     Owing  to   persistent   opposition   by   the   leaders 
of  one  section  of  the  people  to  any  system  of  governmental  education 
and  to  the  refusal  by  the  Legislature  to  make  the  grants  of  land  and 
tnonev   which  had  been  promised,  the  proposed  establishment  of  the 
provincial   university  by  the  British  Government  was  abandoned 

In  so  far  as  the  McGill  College  was  concerned,  however,  the 
Royal  Institution  at  once  took  action  by  applying  for  a  Royal  Charter. 
Such  a  charter  was  granted  in  182:,  and  the  Royal  I-titution  ^  - 
pared  to  take  possession  of  the  estate,  but,  owing  to  protracted  Utiga 
fon  this  was 'not  surrendered  to  them  till  iSap,  when  the  work  o 
teaching  was  begun  in  two  faculties.  Arts  and  Medicine.  Jhe  r eco  d 
of  the  first  thirty  years  of  the  University's  existence  is  an  unbroken 


o_|  FOUNDATION    AND    HISTORY 

tale  of  financial  embarrassment  and  administrative  difficulties.  The 
charter  was  cumbrous  and  unwieldy,  and  unsuited  to  a  small  college 
in  the  circumstances  of  this  country,  and  the  University,  with  the 
exception  of  its  medical  faculty,  became  almost  extinct.  But  after 
thirty  years  the  citizens  of  Montreal  awoke  to  the  value  of  the 
institution  which  was  struggling  in  their  midst.  Several  gentlemen 
undertook  the  responsibility  of  its  reorganization,  and,  in  1852.  an 
amended  charter  was  secured.  The  Governor-General  of  Canada  for 
the  time  being,  Sir  Edmund  Head,  became  interested  in  its  fortunes, 
and  in  1855,  with  the  advent  of  a  new  Principal,  an  era  of  progress 
and  prosperity  began. 

A  course  in  Law  was  begun  in  connection  with  the  Faculty  of 
Arts,  in  1848,  and  the  department  was  established  as  a  separate 
faculty  in  1853.  The  Faculty  of  Applied  Science  was  not  regularly 
organized  till  1878,  but  a  course  in  Engineering,  which  was  amplified 
into  the  Department  of  Practical  Science  in  1871.  was  given  under 
the  Faculty  of  Arts  as  far  back  as  1856.  The  Faculty  of  Agriculture 
was  established   in   1907.

CONSTITUTION    OF    THE    UNIVERSITY  35 

GOVERNMENT    OF    THE    UNIVERSITY. 

By  the  amended  Charter  "the  Governors,  Principal,  and  Fellows" 
of  the  University  are  constituted  a  body  politic  and  corporate,  with 
all  the  usual  rights  and  privileges  of  corporate  bodies.  The  supreme 
authority,  however,  is  vested  in  the  Crown,  and  is  exercised  by  His 
Excellency  the  Governor-General  of  Canada,  for  the  time  being,  as 
Visitor.  This  is  a  special  and  important  feature  of  the  constitution, 
for,  while  it  gives  the  University  an  imperial  character  and  removes 
it  at  once  from  any  merely  local  or  party  influence,  it  secures  the 
patronage  of  the  head  of  the  political  system  of  the  country. 

The  Governors  of  the  University  are  the  members  of  the 
Royal  Institution  for  the  Advancement  of  Learning,  above  mentioned, 
and  in  them  are  vested  the  management  of  finances,  the  passing  of 
University  statutes  and  ordinances,  the  appointment  of  professors, 
and  other  important  duties.  Their  number  is  limited  to  twenty-five, 
and  vacancies  are  filled  by  the  nomination  of  the  remaining  members 
with  the  approval  of  the  Visitor.  The  President  of  the  Board  of 
Governors  is  cx-oMcio  Chancellor  of  the  University. 

The  Principal  is  the  academic  head  and  chief  administrative 
officer.  He  is  appointed  by  the  Board  of  Governors  (of  which  body 
he  is  a  member  cx-oKcio).  He  also  holds  the  office  of  Vice-Chan- 
cellor  of  the  University. 

The  Fellows  (42  in  number)  are  selected  with  reference  to 
the  representation  of  all  the  faculties  and  departments  of  the  Univer- 
sity, and  of  the  graduates,  affiliated  colleges,  and  other  bodies. 

The  Governors.  Principal  and  Fellows  together,  constilute 
the  Corporation,  the  highest  academical  body.  Its  powers  are 
fixed  by  statute,  and  include  the  framing  of  all  regulations  touching 
courses  of  study,  matriculation,  graduation,  discipline  and  the  grant- 
ing of  degrees. 

The  administration  of  these  regulations,  along  with  direct  respon- 
sibility for  the  conduct  of  the  educational  work  of  the  University,  is 
entrusted  to  the  several  Faculties,— Arts,  Medicine,  Law,  Applied 
Science,    Agriculture,   Dentistry,  and   Music. 

The  Principal,  the  Deans  of  the  several  Faculties,  the  Professors 
and  Associate  Professors,  and  other  members,  not  exceeding  ten  in 
number,  of  the  teaching  staflf,  constitute  the  Academic  Board  of  the 
University,  with  the  duty  of  considering  such  matters  as  pertain  to 
the  interests  of  the  University  as  a  whole,  and  of  making  recom- 
mendations concerning  the  same. 


INCORPORATED    AND    AFFILIATED    COLLEGES. 


INCORPORATED     COLLEGES. 

Macdonald  College  is  situated  at  Ste.  Anne  de  Bellevue,  about 
twenty  Miilcs  from  Montreal.  It  consists  of  three  departments: — The 
School  of  Agriculture,  the  School  of  Household  Science,  and  the 
School  for  Teachers.  Courses  leading  to  the  Bachelor's  and  Master's 
degrees  in  Agriculture  are  under  the  control  of  the  Corporation  of 
McGill  University;  all  the  short  term  courses  in  agriculture,  as  well

Undergraduates  in  Arts  residing  in  afifiliated  theological  colleges, 
with  a  view  to  a  course  in  theology,  are  able  to  obtain  board  and  lodg- 
ing for  less  than  the  minimum  shown  above,  and  in  all  Faculties  the 
expense  under  the  head  of  "  Books  and  Instruments  "  can  be  reduced 
bv  purchasing  these  at  second-hand. 

It  will  be  noticed  that  in  the  above  estimate  no  account  is  taken 
of  personal  expenses,  such  as  cost  of  clothes,  laundry,  etc.,  nor  yet  of 
the  caution  money  deposit  which  is  made  by  each  student  at  the 
commencement  of  the  session.  This  amounts  to  $5.00  m  the  Faculties 
of  Arts  and  Law  and  $10.00  in  the  Faculties  of  Medicine  and  Applied 
Science.  It  might  be  well  also  to  reckon  on  at  least  $20.00  or  $25.00 
per  annum  for  subscriptions  of  various  kinds. 


LOAN    FUNDS. 


1.  A  fund  has  been  established  by  the  Applied  Science  Class  of 
1899,  to  be  known  as  "The  Class  of  1899  Fund,"  for  the  purpose  of 
aiding,  each  year,  one  or  more  students  who,  upon  the  completion  of 
their  second  year  work,  require  assistance  to  enable  them  to  finish 
their  course  of  study.  The  loans  from  this  fund  made  to  students  will 
be  repayable  after  graduation.  Applications  should  be  made  through 
the"  Dean. 

2.  The  George  Henry  Frost  Fund  was  created  by  the  gentleman 
whose  name  it  bears  for  the  purpose  of  aiding  students  who,  when 
commencing  the  work  of  the  second  or  subsequent  years,  in  the 
Faculty  of  Applied  Science,  require  assistance  to  enable  them  to  com- 
plete their  course.  Loans  from  this  fund  will  bear  interest  at  three 
per  cent,  and  will  be  repayable  -within  three  years  after  graduation. 
In  making  loans  from  this  fund  the  academic  standing  of  the  students 
will  be  taken  into  account.

three  years.  The  scholar  must  be  a  British  subject,  must  be  over  19 
and  under  25  years  of  age,  and  must  have  reached  at  least  the  end 
of  his  sophomore  or  second  year  in  the  University. 

Rhodes  Scholarships  have  been  awarded  by  McGill  as  follows: — 
1904,  Herbert  J.  Rose,  B.A.,  and  John  G.  Archibald,  B.A. ;  1905,  Talbot 
M.  Papineau,  B.A. ;  1906,  Alexander  R.  McLeod,  B.A.;  1908,  Frank

Beginning  with  1920  the  old  method  of  selection  by  the  Univer- 
sities of  the  Province  in  a  certain  order  of  rotation  was  discontinued, 
and  now  scholars  are  chosen  by  a  general  committee  and  the  com- 
petition is  open  to  candidates  from  the  whole  Province  without  any 
regard  to  Universities  at  all. 

2.  Science  Scholarships  granted  by  Her  Majesty's  Commis- 
sioners FOR  the  E.xhibition  OF  1851. — These  scholarships,  of  the  value 
of  £200  sterling  a  year,  are  tenable  for  two,  or,  in  rare  instances,  three 
years.  They  are  limited,  according  to  the  Report  of  the  Commission, 
"to  those  branches  of  science,  such  as  physics,  mechanics  and  chem- 
istry, the  extension  of  which  is  specially  important  for  our  national 
industries."  Their  object  is  not  to  facilitate  ordinary  collegiate 
studies,  but  "to  enable  students  to  continue  the  prosecution  of  science 
with  the  view  of  aiding  in  its  advance  or  in  its  application  to  the 
industries  of  the  country." 

It  is  open  to  students  of  not  less  than  three  years'  standing  who 
have  shown  evidence  of  capacity  for  original  research,  and  is  tenable 
at  any  university  or  other  institution  approved  by  the  Commission. 

A  nomination  to  one  of  these  Scholarships  may  be  granted  to 
McGill  University  in  1921,  in  v/hich  event  applications  should  be  sent

The  following  resolution  should  be  noted  here  :  "The  Corporation 
of  the  University  viewing  with  marked  disfavour  the  organized  kid- 
napping or  other  proceedings  of  a  violent  and  objectionable  character 
practised  by  the  students  of  the  First  and  Second  Years  at  the  begin- 
ning of  the  Session,  hereby  requires  the  student  body  to  discontinue 
such  practices  under  severe  penalties." 

8.  If  on  an  occasion  of  general  disorder  on  the  part  of  a  year, 
class,  or  group  of  students,  damage  be  done  to  University  property, 
or  acts  committed  meriting  discipline,  and  the  individuals  who  have 
done  such  damage,  or  committed  such  acts,  have  not  been  discovered, 
an  assessment  to  cover  the  damage  may  be  laid,  or  a  fine  imposed,  or 
both,  on  all  the  members  of  such  year,  class  or  group. 

9.  While  in  College,  or  in  the  college  grounds,  students  shall 
conduct  themselves  in  the  same  orderly  manner  as  in  the  class-rooms. 
Smoking  is  prohibited  in  the  college  buildings,  except  in  such  rooms, 
if  any,  as  may  be  set  apart  for  that  purpose.  Any  professor  observing 
improper  conduct  on  the  part  of  the  student  in  the  college  buildings 
or  grounds  may  admonish  him,  and,  if  necessary,  report  him  to  the 
Dean  of  the  Faculty  in  which  he  is  enrolled.  Without  as  well  as 
within  the  walls  of  the  college,  every  .student  is  required  to  maintain 
a  good  moral  character. 


COLLEGE    GROUNDS    AND    ATHLETICS. 


I.  The  management  of  the  college  grounds  and  of  out-door 
athletics  and  sports  is  under  the  control  of  the  Committee  on  Physical 
Education.  This  Committee  is  responsible  for  the  general  mainte- 
nance of  all  University  grounds,  and  retains  the  ultimate  authority  and 
power  of  supervision  in  all  matters  affecting  athletics  in  the  Univer- 
sity. All  matters  which  may  in  any  way  afifect  athletics  must  be 
referred  to  this  Committee,  and  its  approval  must  be  obtained  before 
any  departure  is  made  from  the  authorized  routine. 

All  students  entering  the  University  for  the  first  time  and  all 
others  desirous  of  taking  part  in  football  matches,  or  otherwise  en- 
gaging in  violent  athletic  contests,  must  pass  a  medical  examination 
to  be  held  under  the  direction  of  the  Director  of  Physical  Education 
during  the  month  of  October.  A  complete  record  of  all  such  exam- 
inations shall  be  kept  by  the  Director  or  some  other  officer  appointed 
to  this  duty.  The  managers  and  captains  of  clubs,  or  other  responsible 
executive  olKicers,  are  required  to  insist  upon  the  strict  observance  of 
the  rule  in  regard  to  medical  examination,  and  all  the  rules  and 
regulations  of  the  Committee  which  concern  them. 

All  clubs  must  submit  their  regulations,  rules,  and  by-laws,  and 
any  changes  in  the  same,  for  the  approval  of  the  Committee.  They 
must  make  application  for  the  use  of  such  portions  of  th.e  grounds 
as  they  require,  and  for  any  special  privileges. 

Clubs  must  not  engage  in  matches  with  outside  clubs,  except  with 
the  approval  of  the  Committee. 

During  the  session,  and  including  the  Christmas  holidays,  all 
teams  and  individual  students  desiring  to  participate  in  outside 
athletics*  must  first  obtain  a  sanction  from  the  Athletic  Association, 
such  sanction  to  be  approved  by  the  Committee  on  Physical  Education. 

Students  who  participate  in  outside  athletics  without  having 
received  such  sanction  may  be  suspended  from  the  University  by  the 
Committee  on  Physical  Education,  if  the  consent  of  the  Principal  has 
been  given,   until   Corporation  shall  meet  to  deal  with  the  matter. 

The  Athletic  Association  must  submit  its  programme  for  each 
year  for  the  approval  of  the  Commiflee. 


*  Outside  athletics  is  interpreted  to  mean  those  athletics  over 
which  the  Athletic  Association  of  the  University  or  the  Canadian 
Intercollegiate  Athletic  Union  does  not  have  control. 


COLLEGE    GROUNDS    AND    ATHLETICS  I07 

All  students  in  good  standing  who  are  taking  a  course  of  study 
held  to  be  sufficient  by  a  special  committee  of  the  Faculty  in  which 
they  are  enrolled  will  be  allowed  to  take  part  in  athletics,  subject, 
however,  to  the  general   regulation  regarding  medical  examination. 

Suspension  from  lectures  for  any  cause,  or  absence  from  more 
than  one-eighth  of  the  total  number  of  lectures  given  in  any  course, 
as  shown  by  the  monthly  reports  furnished  to  the  Dean  of  each 
Faculty  by  the  several  professors  and  lecturers,  shall  be  considered 
as  sufficient  ground  to  disqualify  a  student  from  engaging  in  athletic 
contests. 

All  students  of  the  University  are  required  to  pay  a  fee  of  three 
dollars  ($,3.00)  for  the  use  of  the  grounds  (this  is  included  in  the 
genera]  fee  of  $10.00  paid  by  undergraduates).  The  amount  so  paid 
is  handed  over  to  the  Executive  of  the  Students'  Council,  and  is  by 
this  body  expended  in  the  interest  of  college  athletics,  under  the 
general   direction  of  the  Committee  on   Physical   Education. 

The  amount  derived  as  grounds  and  athletics  fees  from  the  stu- 
dents of  the  Royal  Victoria  College  is  placed  at  the  disposal  of  the 
Committee  in  charge  of  the  grounds,  for  expenditure  in  the  interests 
of  women-students. 

The  annual  sports  of  the  University  are  held  on  the  third  Friday 
of  October  in  each  year.     The  day  is  observed  as  a  holiday. 

Such  persons  as  are  entitled  to  use  the  grounds  shall  be  pro- 
vided with  tickets,  renewable  each  year.  Those  entitled  to  tickets  are 
the  members  of  the  University  and  prominent  benefactors,  and  the 
families  of  Governors  and   Professors.

SUMMER    READINGS. 

{For  students  entering  the  Second,  Third  and  Fourth   Years.) 

Summer  readings  are  obligatory  for  every  undergraduate  and 
conditioned  undergraduate  in  the  Faculty,  except  in  the  case  of  candi- 
dates who  read  and  compete  for  scholarships  and  exhibitions  in  Sep- 
tember. 

The  readings  prescribed  for  the  session  1920-21  are  posted  on  the 
notice   boards   of  the  Arts   Building  and  the   Royal  Victoria   College. 

The  summer  readings  for  honour  students  are  left  in  the  hands 
of  the  departments  concerned.

day, October  2nd,  a.m.)  to  pass  an  oral  examination  in  each  of  the 
books  selected  by  them. 

Students  who  fail  to  do  this  must,  before  the  end  of  the  first 
term,  take  a  written  examination;  failure  to  pass  this  examination 
involves  the  same  penalties  as  failure  in  one  subject  in  the  sessional 
examinations.

EXAMINATIONS    IN    ARTS  121 

can  count  for  a  degree.  Medals,  scholarships,  exhibitions  and  prizes 
shall  not  be  awarded  to  Partial  Students.  A  certificate  of  standing  can 
be  obtained  from  the  Dean  if  requested.  A  partial  student  who  fails  in 
any  subject  at  the  First  Term  Examinations  shall  be  allowed  to  con-

Department   concerned. 

EXAMINATIONS  IN  ARTS. 

There  are  two  examinations  in  each  session,  the  Intermediate  and 
the  Final.  Intermediate  Examinations  are  held  either  at  the  end  of 
the  first  term, 'or  at  such  intervals  during  the  session  as  each  depart- 
ment may  prescribe.  In  the  second,  third  and  fourth  years,  Inter- 
mediate Examinations  will  be  held  or  not,  as  may  be  determined  by 
each   department. 

Students  prevented  by  illness  from  attending  the  Intermediate 
Examinations  will,  on  presenting  a  medical  certificate  to  the  Dean,  be 
given  sessional  standing  on  the   results  of  the  Final  Examination. 

Undergraduates  and  conditioned  undergraduates  of  the  first  year

ciations mentioned  fails  to  nominate  its  delegate. 

POLICY   OF   THE    SCHOOL. 

In  "all  subjects  the  work  will  be,  as  far  as  possible,  of  a  practical 
nature.  Thus  the  English  courses  will  include  a  drilling  in  letter- 
writing,  precis-writing,  and  the  preparation  of  reports.  The  French, 
German  and  Spanish  courses  will  aim  at  imparting  facility  in  speaking 
as  well  as  in  writing,  and  will  consider  the  special  phraseology  em- 
ployed in  business  correspondence.  The  mathematical  and  scientific 
courses  will  deal  in  the  fullest  manner  with  applications  to  industry, 
commerce,  and  finance.  In  the  lectures  on  History,  Political  Economy, 
and  Commercial  Law,  the  aim  will  be  in  the  first  case  to  trace  the 
growth  and  development  of  modern  ideas  and  institutions;  next,  to 
impart  a  knowledge  of  those  general  economic  principles  which  are 
necessary  to  a  full  understanding  of  other  subjects;  in  the  third 
instance,  to  give  the  student  such  an  acquaintance  with  the  law  as 
may  be  of  real  service  in  everyday  business  transactions.  Finally, 
in  Accountancy,  the  conditions  and  methods  imposed  by  the  increasing 
complexity  of  commercial,  industrial  and  financial  organizations  will 
be  considered   in  detail. 


SCHOOL    OF    COMMERCIAL    STUDIES  163 

At  the  same  time  it  will  be  among  the  chief  concerns  of  the 
School  of  Commerce  to  accustom  the  student  to  the  exercise  of  inde- 
pendent thought  on  all  subjects,  and  particularly  on  those  related  to 
industry,  commerce,  and  finance.  To  this  end  he  will  be  expected 
from  time  to  time  to  analyse  his  mental  attitude  towards  each  subject, 
to  note  the  bearings  of  each  on  all  other  subjects,  and  to  embody  the 
results  of  his  analysis  in  an  essay  or  essays.  These  methods  will  com- 
pel him  to  call  into  play  his  independent  judgment,  and  will  thus  assist 
in  developing  those  qualities  of  adaptability,  self-reliance,  and  re- 
sourcefulness that  make  for  leadership. 

FEE    FOR    COURSE. 

The  sessional    fee   is  $150.00. 

At  the  request  of  the  students  themselves,  and  by  the  authority  of 
Corporation,  an  additional  fee  of  $10.00  will  be  exacted  for  the  sup- 
port of  the  Literary  Society,  the  Undergraduates'  Society,  the  Cana- 
dian Club,  the  Union,   the  "  McGill  Daily."  and  Athletics. 

COURSES  OF   LECTURES. 
English. 

The  fundamental  purpose  of  the  course  in  English  is  to  train 
students  to  deal  with  such  problems  of  expression  as  arise  in  com- 
mercial life.  Considerable  attention  will  be  given  to  business  cor- 
respondence and  other  forms  of  commercial  writing.  The  interests 
of  students,  however,  are  best  served,  even  for  these  special  purposes, 
by  a  more  general  training  in  English.  These  courses  will  therefore 
include  practice  in  various  kinds  of  writing,  as  well  as  some  study  of 
modern  English  literature.  As  far  as  possible  the  writing  prescribed 
for  students  will  be  related  to  the  work  they  are  doing  in  other  classes. 

The  following  is  a  brief  outline  of  the  work: — 

FIRST    VE.AR 

(a)  A  course  on  English  Literature  from  Chaucer  to  the  present 
day. 

(b)  English    Composition,    including    the    study    and    analysis    of 
representative    works    of   modern    English. 

SECOND    YEAR.

of  contracts  and  other  commercial  documents ;  essays  dealing  with 
the  subject-matter  of  courses  on  Business  Organization,  Economics, 
Historv  of   Commerce.

THIRD    YEAR. 

In  this  year  the  student,  while  continuing  the  work  begun  in  the 
first  year  and  carried  on  into  the  second,  will  be  further  required  to. 
write  a  series  of  essays  involving  research  work. 

French. 

The  study  of  French  will  be  first  approached  from  the  literary- 
side,  both  in  order  to  increase  its  value  to  the  student  as  aii  element 
of  culture  and  in  order  to  afford  a  sufficient  backg,round  for  the 
commercial  studies  which  are  to  come  later.  These  commercial  studies 
will  begin  in  the  second  year  and  will  comprise  about  half  of  the 
work  done  in  that  year.  In  the  third  year  the  work  will  be  almost 
entirely  of  a  commercial  character. 

The  following  is  a  synopsis  of  the  work: — 

FIRST    YEAR. 

The  student  will  have   a  choice  between:

GENERAL  INFORMATION. 

Admission. 

Qualifications. — The  work  of  the  Department  should  be  considered 
in  the  light  of  post-graduate  work.  The  most  desirable  student  for 
such  work  is  a  college  graduate  or  person  of  equivalent  education 
who  has  had  from  three  to  five  years  experience  in  some  other  field 
of  work,  such  as  teaching  or  business.  Graduate  nurses  with  general 
education  equivalent  to  matriculation  standard  should  take  the  course 
successfully.  Persons  under  twenty-one  years  and  over  thirty-five 
years  of  age  will  only  be  admitted  for  exceptional   reasons.   ■ 

Training  may  make  a  .social  worker  efficient,  but  irt  social  work 
as  in  much  other  work,  it  is  the  human  qualifications  which  distirr- 
guish  the  effective  from  the  ineffective.  The  success  of  the  social 
worker  is  largely  dependent  upon  personality;  therefore,  tact,  patience, 
sympathy,  poise,  cheerfulness,  aiid.  tlmt  something  which  we  may  term 
"  religion "',  and  which  "  calls "  a  person  into  social  work,  may  be 
considered  the  prerequisites  of  an  embryo  social   worker. 


■  DEPARTMENT    OF    SOCIAL    SERVICE  177

obtain  an  average  mark  of  50  in  all,  and  not  less  than  40  in  any  one 
written  examination.  Students  must  also  receive  satisfactory  reports 
from  the  social  agencies  in  which  their  field  work  has  been  taken. 

Students  holding  degrees  from  any  recognized  university  will  be 
given  credit  for  courses  which  may  have  been  covered  by  the  student 
in  taking  a  degree,  but  the  Department  may  require  such  students  to 
write  an  examination  on  such  subjects. 

Students  satisfying  the  examiners  in  Courses  i  and  2  and  7  to 
15,  and  taking  the  full  amount  of  field  work,  will  receive  a  certificate 
for  the  work  taken. 

Field  Work. 

Too  much  emphasis  cannot  be  given  to  the  importance  of  field 
work  as  part  of  the  training  of  a  social  worker.  The  field  work 
during  the  first  term  will  be  taken  with  the  Charity  Organization 
Society.  In  the  second  term  the  student  will  be  permitted  to  choose 
from  one  of  several  fields  which  will  include  work  with  Hospital 
Social  Service  Departments,  Children's  Agencies,  the  Women's  Direc- 
tory, which  works  with  unmarried  mothers,  and  the  Social  Settle- 
ments. 

Time  Required. 

Students  cannot  expect  to  do  the  work  of  the  Department  satis- 
factorily unless  able  to  give  their  full  time.  The  Lecture  and  Field 
Work  schedule  and  reading  required  will  allow  ample  time  for  neces- 
sary recreation. 

Library  and  Reading  Room. 

Students  will  have  the  privilege  of  using  the  Redpath  Library, 
on  making  the  customary  deposit  of  $5-00 ;  a  small  reference  library 
is  maintained  for  the  use  of  the  students  in  the  Reading  Room  of  the 
Department's  offices  in  the  Arts  Building.

in  the  work  of  the  Settlement. 

Bursaries. 

A  small  loan  fund  is  at  the  disposal  of  the  Committee  from 
which  assistance  can  be  given  to  a  student  who  would  otherwise  be 
unable  to  take  the  work  of  the  Department. 

Loans  will  be  repayable  on  easy  terms. 

Applications  for  assistance  from  this  fund  should  be  made  not 
later  than  September   ist. 

Opportunities  for  Employment. 

Students  qualifying  for  the  Diploma  of  the  Department,  who  have 
had  no  previous  experience  in  Social  Work,  may  expect  to  secure 
positions  at  a  salary  of  not  less  than  $goo  per  annum. 

Maturer  students  with  previous  experience  as  teachers  or  in  busi- 
ness may  expect  to  secure  from  $1,200  to  $1,800  at  once. 

The  services  of  two  of  the  Certificate  students  of  the  year  1919-20 
have  already  been  engaged  at  salaries  of  $1,800  and  $1,200  per  annum. 

Diploma  students  may  expect  to  find  positions  in  one  or  other 
of  the  following  fields : — Care  Work  with  "  Family  Care "  Agencies,

FACULTY    OF    APPLIED    SCIENCE. 


DEGREES. 


The  degrees  conferred  by  the  University  upon  such  undergrad- 
uates of  the  Faculty  as  fulfil  the  conditions  and  pass  the  examinations 
hereinafter  stated  are  "Bachelor  of  Architecture"  (B.Arch.),  and 
"Bachelor  of  Science"  (B.Sc),  mention  being  made  in  the  diplomas 
of  the  latter  of  the  particular  course  of  study  pursued. 

Students  who  take  the  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in  one  of  the 
courses  provided  by  the  Faculty  may  graduate  in  any  of  the  remain- 
ing courses  by  attending  one  or  more  subsequent  sessions  and  passing 
the  prescribed  additional  examinations. 

Students  who  wish  to  obtain  the  degrees  of  B.A.  and  B.Sc.  (Ap- 
plied Science)  in  six  years,  will  spend  the  first  three  years  in  Arts 
before  attending  any  classes  in  Applied  Science,  except  in  the  summer 
courses  referred  to  below ;  they  will  then  enter  the  Faculty  of  Applied 
Science  and  devote  the  remaining  three  years  entirely  to  the  work  of 
this  Faculty.  The  special  summer  courses  mentioned  take  the  place 
of  the  work  in  descriptive  geometry,  drawing  (freehand  and  mechan- 
ical) and  shopwork,  which  form  part  of  the  regular  course  of  the  first 
year  in  Applied  Science.  This  work  must  be  taken  in  two  periods  of 
one  month  each,  prior  to  the  regular  work  of  the  second  and  third 
years  in  the  Faculty  of  Arts ;  and  must  not  be  taken  during  the  regular 
session  in  any  of  the  three  years  spent  in  that  faculty. 

Every  student  who  intends  to  take  this  double  course  must  notify 
the  Dean  of  the  Faculty  of  Applied  Science  to  this  effect,  on  or  before 
the  close  of  his  first  year  in  Arts  (May  ist),  and  must  pay  the  fee  of 
$50.00  to  the  Bursar,  for  the  first  of  his  summer  schools,  before  the 
date  scheduled  for  the  beginning  of  the  school  in  question. 

By  a  resolution  of  the  Institution  of  Civil  Engineers  (England) 
the  holders  of  the  degree  of  B.Sc,  in  the  courses  of  civil,  electrical, 
mechanical  and  mining  engineering;  who  are  desirous  of  becommg 
Associate  Members  of  the  Institution,  may  under  certain  conditions  be 
exempted    from    the    examination    prescribed    for    admission    to    the 

Institution.

COURSES    IN    APPLIED    SCIENCE  I05 

*  COURSES  OF  INSTRUCTION. 

The  instruction  in  this  Faculty  is  designed  to  afford  a  thorough 
training  of  a  practical  as  well  as  theoretical  nature,  in  the  following 
branches  of  applied  science : — 

I. — Architecture. 
II. — Chemistry.** 
III. — Chemical  Engineering.* 
IV. — Civil  Engineering  and  Surveying. 
V. — Electrical  Engineering. 
VI. — Mechanical  Engineering. 
VII. — Metallurgical  Engineering. 
VIII. — Metallurgy.** 
IX. — Mining  Engineering. 

The  courses  in  Chemistry  and  Metallurgy  heretofore  offered  have 
been  discontinued,  except  for  students  who  had  already  entered  them 
and  were  in  attendance  in  good  standing  in  the  session  of   1919-20. 

Military  Instruction  (subject  No.  400)  may  be  given  as  alter- 
native to  certain  subjects  in  connection  with  courses  III  to  VII 
inclusive   (see  pages  193  to  203). 

CURRICULUM. 

The  curriculum  as  laid  down  in  the  following  pages  may  be  changed 
from  time  to  time  as  deemed  advisable  by  the  Faculty,  and  in  no  case  shall 
it   be    binding   beyond    the    session    covered   by    this   calendar   announcement. 

The  regular  work  of  each  session  in  Applied  Science  will  end 
about  the  30th  of  April  at  the  close  of  the  sessional  examinations. 
The  summer  work  will  be  taken  during  the  month  of  May  except  as 
specified  on  page  204. 

The  work  prescribed  for  the  first  two  years  is  the  same  in  all 
courses,  except  in  that  leading  to  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Archi- 
tecture  (Course  I). 

The  first  two  years  of  the  engineering  courses  (III  to  VII)  are 
mainly  devoted  to  mathematics,  mechanics,  physics,  chemistry,  draw- 
ing and  shopwork,  as  it  is  deemed  necessary  that  students  in  these 
courses  should  master  the  general  principles  underlying  scientific 
work  before  commencing  the  subjects  of  the  professional  courses. 


*  No  student  shall  be  permitted  to  enter  the  third  year  of  this 
course,  who  has  failed  to  secure  at  least  second  class  standing  in 
Second  Year  Chemistry  and  Laboratory.  e      ^    rnn

I.     ARCHITECTURE. 

The  course  for  the  degree  of  Bachelor  of  Architecture  extends 
over  five  years.  Full  information  is  given  in  the  Announcement  of 
the  Department,  which  will  be  sent  to  interested  persons  upon  request 
to  the  Registrar  of  the  University. 

The  work  of  the  first  year  is  s'imilar  in  most  respects  to  that  of 
the  first  year  in  other  Departments  in  Applied  Science,  but  special 
instruction  is  given  in  Drawing  and  Architectural  Geometry. 

The  object  of  this  curriculum  is  to  impart  such  general  culture, 
scientific  knowledge  and  skill  of  hand  as  will  prepare  the  student  to 
profit  by  the  work  of  the  succeeding  years,  under  the  heads  of  :— 

(a)   Design;       (b)   Aesthetic;       (c)   Archaeology;       (d)   Science; 
{e)   Construction;    (/) Professional    Practice;    (g)  Drawing. 

\n  essay  on  an  historical  or  theoretical  subject  is  required  in 
each  term  from  all  students  following  the  historical  or  theoretical 
courses. 

In  all  courses  studio  work  goes  hand  in  hand  with  oral  teaching, 
with   a  view  to  the  practical   application  of  the  theory,  while  at  the

same    time    affording    opportunity    for    the    acquisition    of    power    in 
draughtsmanship  and  practice  in  design. 

An  arrangement  has  been  concluded  between  McGill  University 
and  the  Province  of  Quebec  Association  of  Architects,  whereby  holders 
of  the  Bachelor  of  Architecture  degree  are  admitted  to  practice  in  the 
Province  after  spending  one  year  in  the  office  of  a  member  of  the 
Association,  and  passing  an  examination  in  design,  instead  of  having 
to  take  the  regular  prescribed  entrance  examinations.  The  office 
experience  may  be  gained  by  working  in  the  summer  vacations.

COURSE   IN    CHEMICAL   ENGINEERING  I9I 

II.     CHEMICAL  ENGINEERING.* 

The  aim  of  this  course  is  to  prepare  students  for  positions  demand- 
ing a  knowledge  of  both  chemistry  and  engineering.  The  duties  of  a 
chemical  engineer  require  him  to  be  conversant  with  chemical  pro- 
cesses, the  installation  of  chemical  units,  and  to  understand  the  con- 
struction of  buildings,  the  installation  and  operation  of  machinery,  etc. 
Accordingly  the  course  of  study  combines  a  considerable  amount  of 
engineering  with  the  maximum  of  chemical  training  which  can  be 
attained  without  overpressure. 

Between  the  second  and  third  years  students  taking  this  course 
must  attend  a  summer  session  of  four  weeks  in  the  chemical  labor- 
atories. 

In  the  third  year  specialization  commences,  the  time  being  about 
equally  divided  between  chemical  and  engineering  studies,  and  in  the 
vacation  between  the  third  and  fourth  years  all  students  must  give  at 
least  six  weeks  to  work  in  some  chemical  industry  or  to  equivalent 
laboratory  work  satisfactory  to  the  Professor  of  Chemistry. 

In  the  fourth  year  the  engineering  studies  are  completed  and  the 
chemical  studies  which  predominate  are  arranged  in  two  alternative 
courses  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  students  who  cannot  possibly 
study  more  than  a  few  of  the  very  varied  chemical  industries.  These 
alternative  courses  fall  broadly  under  one  or  other  of  two  headings : — 
(0)  inorganic,  (b)  organic,  as  indicated  in  the  table  below,  and  one  or 
other  of  which  the  student  will  select.  Should  a  student  desire  to 
prepare  for  an  industry  which  requires  more  engineering  knowledge 
than  is  provided  in  the  regular  course  he  may  substitute  additional 
engineering  subjects  for  some  of  the  chemical  work.  Details  will  be 
arranged  on  application  to  the  Faculty  through  the  Professor  of 
Chemistry. 

While  every  effort  will  be  made  to  supply  detailed  information  as 
to  methods  and  plan  of  many  of  the  important  industries,  and  to  pro- 
vide facilities  for  experimentally  carrying  out  the  processes  involved, 
the  main  aim  will  be  devoted  to  the  study  of  the  principles  which 
underlie  economical  production. 

FIRST   AND    SECOND   YEARS. 

As  in  other  Engineering  Courses.  For  details,  see  pages  186  and 
187. 


*  No  student  shall  be  permitted  to  proceed  to  the  third  year  of 
this  course  until  he  has  secured  at  least  second  class  standing  in  the 
subjects  of  General  Chemistry   (51)    and  Chemistry  Laboratory   (52).

COURSE    IN    CIVIL    ENGINEERING  I93 

III.     CIVIL  ENGINEERING. 

The  courses  of  study  are  designed  to  emphasize  the  fundamental 
principles  embodied  in  the  study  of  mechanics,  strength  of  materials, 
and  hydraulics,  while  at  the  same  time  affording  an  opportunity  of 
applying  these  principles  to  practical  problems  ranging  over  as  wide  a 
portion  as  possible  of  the  field  covered  by  the  practice  of  civil  engi- 
neers. A  broad  and  sound  foundation  is  thus  laid  for  future  specializ- 
ation, either  in  graduate  courses  or  in  actual  practice.  The  outlook 
of  the  student  is  further  broadened  by  courses  in  Mechanical  and 
Electrical  Engineering.  In  the  designing  courses  special  attention  is 
given  to  the  interpretation  and  critical  discussion  of  specifications  as 
well  as  to  the  economical  principles  involved.  Students  are  recom- 
mended to  obtain  as  much  practical  experience  as  possible  during  the 
surnmer  vacations,  and  are  specially  recommended  to  spend  at  least 
one  season  in  a  drafting  office  before  the  final  year. 

FIRST    AND   SECOND    YEARS.

COURSE    IN    MECHANICAL    ENGINEERING  IQJ 

V.     MECHANICAL  ENGINEERING. 

The  subjects  of  instruction  in  this  Department  are  of  interest  to 
students  who  are  likely  to  take  up  work  connected  with — 

(o)  The  constructive  or  manufacturing  side  of  mechanical  engin- 
eering, including  industrial  or  production  engineering;  (b)  steam 
engineering;  (c)  gas  engine  and  producer  work;  (d)  power  plant 
engineering;  (e)  heating  and  ventilation  of  buildings  and  factories; 
(/) aeronautics   and   aerodynamics. 

Courses  are  given  during  the  third  and  fourth  years  in  mechan- 
ical engineering  as  applied  to  questions  connected  with  power  installa- 
tions and  prime  movers.  The  earlier  portion  of  this  work  is  supple- 
mentary to  the  instruction  given  in  thermodynamics,  mechanics  of 
machines  and  machine  design,  and  leads  up  to  the  more  advanced  or 
technical  subjects  of  power  plant  design,  industrial  plant  design  and 
works  organization. 

Students  in  the  Department  of  Mechanical  Engineering  take 
systematic  work  in  electrical  engineering  during  the  third  year. 

Instruction  in  workshop  practice  is  given  in  each  of  the  four  years. 
This  work  is  of  a  systematic  nature,  and  is  intended  to  prepare  for, 
but  by  no  means  to  replace,  that  practical  experience  of  manufacturing 
operations  on  a  commercial  basis  which  every  mechanical  engineer 
must  obtain  for  himself. 

The  course  in  thermodynamics  deals  more  particularly  with  the 
theory  of  heat  engines,  and  time  is  assigned  for  additional  graphical 
and  experimental  work  in  connection  with  the  subject. 

Arrangements  are  made  for  occasional  visits  to  power  plants  and 
manufactories  of  importance. 

FIRST   AND   SECOND   YEARS. 

As  in  other  Engineering  Courses  (see  pages  i86  and  187),  with 
additional  course  in  September  for  second  year  (page  204).

COURSE   IN    METALLURGICAL   ENGINEERING  I99 

VI.     METALLURGICAL  ENGINEERING. 

This  course  is  designed  for  students  intending  to  enter  metal- 
lurgical works,  such  as  iron  or  steel  works  or  smelters.  It  includes 
instruction  in  the  engineering,  chemical,  metallurgical  and  ore-dress- 
ing studies  required  by  practising  metallurgists. 

A  certain  amount  of  mining  is  included  in  the  third  year  curri- 
culum in  order  to  show  the  relation  between  mining  and  metallurgy; 
but  the  course  is  not  intended  for  students  wishing  to  become  mining 
engineers. 

In  the  third  year  instruction  is  given  in  chemistry,  assaying, 
geology,  mineralogy,  metallurgy,  mining,  ore-dressing,  and  mechan- 
ical and  structural  engineering. 

After  the  third  year  there  is  a  summer  school  in  metallurgical 
works. 

In  the  fourth  year  instruction  is  given  in  chemistry,  electrical  en- 
gineering, law,  hydraulics,  metallurgy  and  ore-dressing.  Metallurgical 
designing  and  laboratory  work  form  important  parts  of  the  course. 

FIRST   AND    SECOND   YEARS. 

As  in  other  Engineering  Courses.     For  details,  see  pages  186  and

VII.     MINING   ENGINEERING. 

Specialization  does  not  begin  until  the  third  year,  when  an  elemen- 
tary course  in  metallurgy  is  given  and  the  professional  courses  in 
mining,  ore-dressing  and  fire-assaying  are  begun,  but  the  chief  work 
is  still  in  such  fundamental  science  subjects  as  applied  mechanics, 
chemistry,  geolog}-,  mineralogy,  and  mechanical  engineering. 

The  fourth  year,  on  the  other  hand,  is  very  largely  given  up  to 
technical  work  in  mining,  ore-dressing,  economic  geology,  metallurgy, 
and  electrical  engineering,  and  two  elective  alternative  lines  of  study 
are  offered,  both  including  the  essential  subjects  of  the  Mining  Course 
and  leading  to  the  degree,  but  each  permitting  of  a  considerable 
amount  of  specialization,  the  first  (o)  in  advanced  petrography  and 
geology,  the  second    (b)   in  mining  and  ore-dressing  machinery. 

In  both  cases  the  fourth  year  work  includes  the  equivalent  of  at 
least  two  full  days  per  week  in  the  laboratories  and  drafting  room  of 
the  mining  department,  and  in  the  second  term  each  student  is  re- 
quired to  prepare  a  thesis  giving  the  result  of  an  extended  individual 
experimental  investigation. 

A  field  school  in  mining,  ore-dressing  and  geology  is  held  between 
the  third  and  fourth  years,  the  work  ordinarily  beginning  immediately 
after  the  close  of  the  April  examinations.  From  four  to  six  weeks  are 
spent  in  travel,  during  which  a  number  of  mines  and  concentrators  are 
visited  and  critically  studied  under  the  direction  of  the  departmental 
staff. 

Facilities  are  also  afforded  in  the  department  to  graduate  students 
who  wish  to  do  advanced  work  in  mining  or  ore-dressing.

tion in  the  preparation  of  the  essays,  but  due  acknowledgment  must  always 
be  made  of  all  the  authorities  and  books  which  have  been  consulted.  In 
judging  of  the  value  of  the  essays,  account  will  be  taken  not  only  of  the 
subject  matter,  but  also  of  style  and  literary  construction. 

All  essays  when  handed  in  will  become  the  property  of  the  depart- 
ment concerned  and  will  be  filed  for  reference.  Students  may  submit 
duplicate  copies  of  their  essays  in  competition  for  the  students'  prizes 
of  the  Engineering  Institute  of  Canada,  or  of  the  Canadian  Mining  Institute-

examples  from  different  periods  of  the  adaptation  and  abstraction  of 
natural  motifs  in  ornament.  They  are  used  to  show  the  spirit  in 
which  to  work  out  ornament,  and  are  not  copied  directly.  Models  of

prepared  to  pass  an  examination  on  a  selected  theoretical,  aesthetical, 
or  historical  architectural  work,  and  in  addition  to  this,  to  spend  at 
least  five  weeks  in  the  office  of  some  architect  or  contractor;  the 
period  of  such  employment  to  be  certified  by  a  letter  from  the  em- 
ployer. For  the  students  who  for  any  reason  find  it  impracticable  to 
do  office  work,  the  substitution  of  thirty-five  reasonably  large  free- 
hand-sketches,  re;idered  in  any  desired  medium,  will  be  considered 
an  equivalent.

mination of  the  best  methods  for  the  treatment  of  particular  ores  and 
coals.  A  large  number  of  different  lots  of  ore  are  available  in  suffi- 
cient quantities  for  work  on  a  comparatively  large  scale.  New  ores 
are  constantly  being  secured. 

Text-books: — In  addition  to  the  text-books  already  specified  for

Research  Fellowships  and  Advanced  Courses. 

Special  courses  of  instruction  are  offered  to  graduate  students  in 
mining  and  ore-dressing.  These  courses  include  lectures,  colloquia 
and  individual  work  in  the  laboratories  and  drafting  room.     There  are 


244  FACULTY    OF    APPLIED    SCIENCE 

three  endowed  Research  Fellowships  in  the  gift  of  the  Mining  Depart- 
ment. These  are  assigned  to  graduates  of  the  department  who  show 
particular   aptitude   for  advanced   work. 

Laboratories. 
The  specific  laboratory  instruction  in  mining  subjects  proper 
begins  in  the  third  year,  with  courses  in  assaying,  elementary  rfietal- 
lurgy  and  ore-dressing.  In  the  fourth  year  this  work  is  elaborated, 
the  general  method  of  instruction  being  first  to  conduct  a  limited 
number  of  important  tj'pical  operations,  and  then  to  assign  to  each 
student  certain  methods  which  he  must  study  out  in  detail,  and  upon 
which  he  must  experiment  and  make  a  written  report.  In  this  work 
he  is  guided  by  the  professors  and  fellows,  and  assisted  by  the  other 
students,  whom  he  must  in  turn  assist  when  practicable.  In  this  way 
every  student  acquires  detailed  knowledge  of  certain  typical  operations 
and  makes  at  least  one  original  investigation  and  at  the  same  time 
gains  a  fair  general  experience  of  many  of  the  important  methods 
in  use. 

Illustrations,   Museums,    Societies,   etc. 

In  addition  to  a  large  series  of  lantern  slides,  the  department 
owns  a  collection  of  over  four  thousand  photographs  and  other 
illustrations,  and  a  large  and  representative  library  including  selected 
trade  catalogues,  etc.     These  collections  are  constantly  being  enlarged. 

The  museums  of  the  building  contain  suites  of  ores,  concentrates, 
fuels,  and  metallurgical  materials,  models  of  mines  and  furnaces,  and 
collections  of  finished  products. 

The  McGill  University  Mining  Society  and  the  Mining  Society 
Camera  Club  meet  at  stated  periods  to  read  and  discuss  papers  by 
graduate  and  student  members,  and  occasionally  to  hear  lectures  by 
gentlemen  eminent  in  the  profession.  The  Society  has  been  made  a 
students'  section  of  the  Canadian  Mining  Institute,  and  its  under- 
graduate members  are  therefore  student  members  of  the  Institute, 
and  receive  all  its  publications.  Papers  read  before  the  Mining  Society 
may  be  entered  in  competition  for  all  students'  prizes  offered  by  the 
Canadian  Mining  Institute,   or  the  Engineering   Institute   of  Canada. 

Field   School   in    Mining. 

294.  The  summer  vacation  field  class,  instituted  in  1898,  is  now 
a  fixed  part  of  the  course.  All  students  of  Mining  in  regular  course 
are  required  to  attend  this  class  at  the  end  of  the  third  year. 

The  school  lasts  from  four  and  one-half  to  six  weeks,  depending 
on  where  it  is  held.  Of  this  period  about  one-sixth  is  given  to  field 
work  in  geology,  one-half  or  more  to  mining  work  proper,  and  the 
remainder  to  an   examination   of  ore-dressing   and   milling  plants   and 


PHYSICS  245 

metallurgical  establishments.  The  Professor  or  the  Associate  Professor 
of  Mining  and  other  members  of  the  staff  go  with  the  party  and  hold 
daily  demonstrations  or  classes.  The  students  take  notes  and  sketches 
on  the  ground,  and  afterwards  are  required  to  work  up  these  notes 
and  to  submit  a  formal  report. 

During  the  last  twenty  years  these  field  parties  have  visited 
British  Columbia  nine  times.  Nova  Scotia  six  times,  Newfoundland, 
Pennsylvania  and  Michigan  twice  each.  Numerous  visits  have  also 
been  made  to  Sudbury,  Cobalt  and  other  Ontario  localities,  while 
en  route  to  more  distant  points. 

The  instruction  given  during  this  field  course  is  free  to  all  Mining 
students,  the  only  expense  to  them  being  the  cost  of  board,  lodging 
and  railway  fares.  These  expenses  are  kept  as  low  as  is  practicable 
and  are  in  part  met  by  the  income  of  a  fund  provided  by  the  late  Sir 
William  Macdonald.  from  which  deserving  students  who  require  aid 
can  also  have  money  advanced  them  by  applying  to  the  Professor  of 
Mining. 

At  the  close  of  the  regular  work  of  the  field  school  arrangements 
are  made  with  the  managers  of  the  mines  visited  and  others,  to  give 
the  members  of  the  party  individual  employment  for  the  remainder 
of  the  summer.  All  students  are  earnestly  advised  to  engage  in  such 
work,  and  it  is  probable  that  it  will  be  made  obligatory  at  an  early 
date  in  the  future.

Field  Work. 

Field  work  is  required  of  all  students  entering  the  second  year, 
of  students  of  the  third  year  in  the  courses  of  Civil  and  Mining 
Engineering,  and  of  the  fourth  year  in  the  Civil  Engineering  course. 
The  work  will  begin  in  1921  on  May  2nd,  and  will  continue  for  four 
weeks.* 

All  students  are  required  to  keep  complete  field  notes,  and  to  pre- 
pare maps,  sections  and  estimates  from  their  own  surveys.  This  office 
work  is  principally  done  during  the  regular  summer  school  session. 

Examination'  for  Land  Surveyors  : — Any  graduate  in  the  Faculty 
of  Applied  Science  in  the  Department  of  Civil  Engineering  and  Land 
Surveying  may  have  his  term  of  apprenticeship  shortened  to  one  year 
for  the  profession  of  land  surveying. 

Text-hooks  and  hooks  of  reference : — Johnson  and  Smith's  Theory 
and  Practice  of  Surveying,  Greene's  Practical  and  Spherical  Astro- 
nomy, Hosmers  Practical  Astronomy,  American  Ephemeris  and  Nau- 
tical Almanac.  Baker's  Engineering  Surveying  Instruments,  Breed  and 
Hosmer's  Principles  and  Practice  of  Surveying,  Turnbull's  Under- 
ground Surveying,  Durham's  Mine  Surveying,  Reports  of  the  Cana- 
dian  and  United  States   Geodetic   Surveys. 


*  The  Faculty  may  decide  to  hold  the  fourth  year  field  class  in 
September,  1921,' instead  of  in  May  with  the  second  and  third  year 
classes. 


REGULATIONS  CONCERNING  PREREQUISITE  SUBJECTS. 


REGISTRATION,     STANDING    AND     PROMOTION. 

(i)  Students  proceeding  to  a  degree  shall  be  classed  as  Under- 
graduates or  Conditioned  Undergraduates.  Undergraduates  are  those 
who,  having  passed  all  entrance  requirements,  have  also  at  the  close  of 
any  session  passed  the  examinations  in  all  the  subjects  of  their  course, 
or  who  at  the  opening  of  the  following  session  have  removed  all  con- 
ditions by  passing  supplemental  examinations  in  the  subjects  in  which 
they  failed.  Conditioned  Undergraduates  are  those  who  have  failed 
to  remove  their  conditions  as  above. 

(2)  No  student  proceeding  to  a  degree  shall  be  allowed  to  take 
any  subject,  unless  he  has  previously  passed,  or  secured  exemption  in 
all  prerequisite  subjects.* 

(3)  No  Conditioned  Undergraduate  shall  be  permitted  to  take 
any  second  year  subject  until  he  has  passed,  or  secured  exemption  in 
all  matriculation  requirements,  and  similarly,  no  third  or  fourth  year 
work  may  be  undertaken  until  all  first  or  second  year  subjects  respec- 
tively shall  have  been  passed. 

The  Faculty  may,  however,  waive  this  rule  in  special  cases  on 
recommendation  of  the  Committee  on  Registration,  Standing  and  Pro- 
motion. 

(4)  Conditioned  Undergraduates  proceeding  to  a  degree  must 
follow  a  course  of  study  approved  by  the  Faculty  on  the  recommenda- 
tion of  the  Comm'ittee  on  Registration,  Standing  and  Promotion.  They 
may  be  required  to  repeat  subjects  in  which  they  have  passed,  but  in 
which  their  standing  has  been  low. 

(5)  Partial  students  are  those  who  are  not  proceeding  to  a 
degree.  Such  students  may  be  admitted  to  classes  without  regard  to 
the  prerequisite  rule,  provided  that  they  have  obtained  the  permission 
of  the  head  of  each  department  concerned,  and  have  also  had  their 
courses  approved  by  the  Committee  on  Registration,  Standing  and 
Promotion. 


*  Prerequisite  subjects  are  those  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the 
Faculty,  must  be  mastered  before  the  subjects  to  which  they  are 
prerequisite  can  be  intelligently  studied. 

Concurrent  subjects  are  related  subjects  which  should  be  studied 
in  the  same  session. 


PREREQUISITE    SUBJECTS   IN    APPLIED   SCIENCE  25I 

(6)  If  a  partial  student  wishes  to  obtain  undergraduate  stand- 
ing in  order  to  proceed  to  a  degree,  he  shall  not  be  given  credit  for 
subjects  taken  in  contravention  of  the  prerequisite  rule  until  he  has 
also  passed  examinations  or  secured  exemptions  in  such  prerequisites 
as  may  be  demanded  by  the  Committee  on  Registration,  Standing  and 
Promotion,  and,  on  the  recommendation  of  this  Committee,  has  had 
his  case  approved  by  a  unanimous  vote  of  the  Faculty. 


No  student  who  has  failed  to  remove  all  his  conditions  by  the 
beginning  of  the  second  term  of  the  fourth  year  shall  be  per- 
mitted to  graduate  with  his  class.

Students  have  the  free  use  of  the  Law  Library  of  the  Faculty,  to 
which  large  additions  are  continually  being  made.  The  principal  reports 
and, legal  periodicals  are  taken.  A  special  room  for  Law  students  is 
provided  in  the  University  Library.  The  room  is  open  during  the  day, 
and  in  the  evenings  from  7.30  to  10.30  o'clock. 

There  is  a  lending  library  of  Law-books.  The  use  of  text-books

DEGREES    IN   LAW. 

The  degrees  in  the  Faculty  of  Law  are  the  LL.B.,  B.C.L..  LL.M. 
and  D.C.L.  The  two  last  are  placed  under  the  supervision  of  the 
Committee  on  Graduate  Studies.  Particulars  will  be  found  on  pages

the  degree  of  LL.B. 

The  LL.B.  degree  is  designed  to  supply  a  wide  and  sound  education 
in  Law,  both  for  those  who  do  not  intend  to  follow  the  profession  of 


COURSE    FOR    LL.B.    DEGREE  259 

*:he  Law,  and  for  those  who  do.  To  the  first  class  it  offers  as  part  of  a 
general  education  a  training  in  the  methods  of  legal  thinking,  and 
affords  the  opportunity  of  studying  legal  science  in  relation  to  social 
and  commercial  life. 

Those  who  have  followed  it  will  not  be  qualified  to  practise  Law 
— this  is  not  intended — but  they  will  acquire  a  knowledge  of  law  from 
the  inside  which  will  enable  them  to  control  their  professional  advisers 
and  to  approach  any  simple  legal  problem  with  a  justified  confidence 
in  their  ability  to  handle  it.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  course  will  prove 
particularly  attractive  to  students  who  are  looking  forward  to  a  career 
in  business,  journalism  or  public  life. 

For  the  second  class  of  students— those  who  intend  to  practise  Law 
—the  LL.B.  curriculum  provides  a  valuable  course  of  preliminary  study. 

The  course'  of  study  for  the  LL.B.  degree  extends  over  two  years, 
preceded  by  two  years  in  the  Faculty  of  Arts.  In  the  Faculty  of  Law 
the  subjects  studied  are  as  follows: —

and

Candidates  for  the  LL.B.  degree  who  previously  to  entering  upon 
their  studies  for  the  degree  have  qualified  for  a  degree  m  Applied 
Science  or  Medicine,  are  admitted  to  the  first  year  of  the  LL.B.  course 
without  having  taken  the  preliminary  years  in  the  Faculty  of  Arts.

and  of  the  Empire,  Public  and  Private  International  Law,  all  the 
principal  branches  of  Commercial  Law,  Criminal  Law  and  Procedure

side  of  St.  James  Street,  at  or  near  Place  d'Armes. 

In  the  year  1829,  the  Montreal  Medical  Institution  became,  by  the 
formal  act  of  the  Governors  of  the  Royal  Institution  for  the  Advance- 
ment of  Learning,  the^  Medical  Faculty  of  McGill  University.  It  is 
thus  the  oldest  Faculty  of  the  University.  The  first  session  of  the 
McGill  Medical  Faculty  took  place  in  the  winter  of  1829-30,  and  the 
first  university  degree,  a  medical  one,  was  conferred  four  years  later, 
in  1833. 

There  were  no  sessions  held  during  the  political  troubles  of  1836 
to  1839,  and  it  is  owing  to  this  fact  that  this  is  the  eighty-eighth 
instead  .of  the  ninety-first  session  of  the  Faculty,  dating  from  its  incor- 
poration with  the  University  in  the  year  1829. 

The  work  of  the  Faculty  was  carried  on  in  the  central  part  of  the 
city  until  1872,  when  a  building  was  provided  by  the  Governors  on  the 
University  grounds.  This  building  met  the  demands  of  the  steadily 
increasing  number  of  students  until  1885,  when  an  addition  was  found 
to  be  necessary. 

In  1893,  and  again  in  1898,  further  extensions  and  alterations  were 
made,  funds  for  the  purpose  having  been  provided  by  generous  friends 
of  the  Faculty. 

On  the  i6th  of  April,  1907,  a  part  of  these  new  buildings,  together 
with  the  original  medical  building,  was  destroyed  by  fire.     The  wing

containing  the  principal  laboratories  and  lecture  rooms  was  saved, 
however,  and  is  now  used  by  the  Departments  of  Physiology  and 
Medical  Chemistry. 

The  erection  of  a  new  building  was  at  once  begun  on  a  new  site, 
at  the  corner  of  Pine  Avenue  and  University  St.,  and  in  1910  the 
greater  part  of  it  was  ready  for  occupation.  In  191 1  it  was  wholly 
available  for  the  work  of  the  Faculty  which  can  now  boast  of  one  of 
the  most  modern  and  well-equipped  medical  buildings  on  this  Con- 
tinent.

REQUIREMENTS    FOR   LICENCE   TO    PRACTISE. 

Intending  students  are  reminded  that  a  University  degree  in  iVIedi- 
cine  does  not  always  give  a  right  to  practise  the  profession  of  medi- 
cine. It  is  necessary  to  conform  with  the  medical  laws  of  the  country 
or  province  in  which  it  is  proposed  to  begin  practice.  Each  province 
in  Canada  at  present  has  its  special  requirements  for  licence,  and  in 
most  provinces  a  special  standard  of  general  education  is  insisted  upon 
before  beginning  the  study  of  Medicine.  Students  who  intend  prac- 
tising in  Canada  are  warned  that  in  certain  of  the  provinces  it  is 
necessary  to  be  registered  five  years  before  obtaining  a  licence  to  prac- 
tise. It  follows  that  entrance  qualifications  must  be  registered  in  the 
province  in  which  the  student  intends  to  practise  at  the  beginning  of 
his  course  in  ]\Iedicine. 

For  the  convenience  of  students,  a  list  of  names  and  addresses  of 
the  Registrars  of  the  Medical  Councils  in  the  several  provinces  is  here 
given  °They  should  comply  with  the  requirements  for  registration  m 
one  or  other  of  the  provinces,  before  entering  on  their  course  m  the 
Faculty  of  Medicine.

DEPARTMENT   OF    PHARMACY. 


GENERAL     ANNOUNCEMENT. 

The  Fourth  Session  of  the  Department  of  Pharmacy  will  be 
opened  on   Friday,   October   ist,   1920. 

The  Montreal  College  of  Pharmacy,  organized  as  a  teaching  body 
in  1867,  for  fifty  years  successfully  carried  on  the  work  of  instruc- 
ing  pharmaceutical  students,  and  for  many  years  it  was  the  only 
institution    in  the   Province   of  Quebec  offering   such    instruction. 

As  a  result  of  negotiations  carried  on  during  the  summer  of 
1916,  the  College  of  Pharmacy  was  taken  over  by  the  University,  and 
a  Department  of  Pharmacy  was  instituted  in  connection  with  the 
Faculty  of  Medicine.  Instruction  is,  therefore,  now  given  in  the 
class  rooms  and  laboratories  of  the  University,  and  the  students  of 
Pharmacy  have   a;ccess   to   its  splendid  equipment. 

The  work  of  the  Department  embraces  courses  in  Botany, 
Physics,  Chemistrj'  and  Practical  Chemistry,  Theoretical  and  Prac- 
tical Pharmacy,  Dispensing,  Materia  Medica  and  Toxicology. 

Examinations  in  each  subject  are  held  at  the  close  of  the 
course.  All  students  must  take  these  examinations,  and  those  who 
pass  in  all  subjects  of  the  curriculum,  as  required  by  the  Pharma- 
ceutical Association  of  the  Province  of  Quebec,  will  receive  the 
University  Diploma  of  Pharmacy.  A  minimum  of  60  per  cent,  in 
each  subject  is  required  to  pass,  and  80  per  cent,  for  honours.  The 
examination  requirements  of  the  Pharmaceutical  Association  of  the 
Province  of  Quebec  for  licence  to  practise  pharmacy  in  the  Provmce 
will  be  found  in  the  special  announcement  of  the  Department,  which 
will  be  sent  on  application. 

MATRICULATION. 
For  entrance  into  the  Department  of  Pharmacy  the  University 
accepts  the  preliminary  examination  of  the  Pharmaceutical  Associa- 
tion of  the  Province  of  Quebec,  particulars  of  which  can  be  obtained 
from  the  Secretary  of  the  Association,  249  St.  Catherine  Street  East, 
Montreal.  Students  may  also  enter  by  passing  the  matriculation 
examination  prescribed  for  the  Faculty  of  Medicine.  (See  pages  52 
to  63.) 


FACULTY  OF  DENTISTRY, 


GENERAL  ANNOUNCEMENT. 

In  the  autumn  of  1903.  the  Dental  Association  of  the  Province 
of  Quebec  approached  the  University,  asking  that  a  dental  depart- 
ment be  instituted  in  connection  with  the  Medical  Faculty,  and,  as  a 
result  of  negotiations  continuing  through  the  session  of  1903-04,  the 
University  established  such  a  department.  This  department  was  not 
independent,  but  was  a  section  of  the  Medical  Faculty. 

During  the  Session  1919-20,  the  University  created  a  separate 
faculty,  to  be  known  as  the  Faculty  of  Dentistry;  this  will,  in  con- 
sequence, be  the  first  session  of  Dentistry  as  a  Faculty. 

Students  may  register  in  the  Faculty  of  Dentistry  after  passing

LOCAL     EXAMINATIONS. 

Public  local  examinations  are  held  yearly  at  various  centres 
throughout  the  Dominion  by  examiners  sent  out  by  the  University. 

These  examinations  may  be  looked  upon  as  preparatory  to  the 
examinations  for  diplomas  and  degrees  in  Music  granted  by  the 
University.  There  are  in  most  of  the  subjects  five  grades,  and 
certificates  "gained  in  the  higher  grades  will  exempt  the  candidate  from 
certain  portions  of  the  examinations  for  a  diploma  or  degree. 

DIPLOMA  OF  LICENTIATE  IN  MUSIC. 

Candidates  for  this  diploma  may  elect  to  be  examined  in  one  of 
the  following: — 

Theoretical    subjects    and    composition (Class      I) 

Practical   subjects   as   performers (Class    11) 

Both   theory  and  practice   as   teachers (Class  III) 

The  candidate   must  pass  three  examinations: 

First  Examination: — 

(a)  Rudiments   of   music,   including   sight    reading   and   ear   tests. 

(b)  Harmony  in  four  parts  up  to,  and  including,  dominant  9th. 
(A  practical  test  will  be  substituted  for  performers.) 

(c)  Counterpoint    in    two    parts.     (Practical    test    substituted    for 
performers.) 

(d)  Chief  subject  of  study. 

The  possession  of  the  Highest  Grade  certificate  of  the  local  theo- 
retical examinations  will  exempt  candidates  in  Class  I  from  this 
examination.  In  Class  II,  exemption  may  be  claimed  if  the  candidate 
has  passed  the  Highest  Grade  (practical)  and  the  Senior  or  the  Inter- 
mediate Grade  (theoretical)  of  the  local  examinations. 

In  Class  III  candidates  must  hold  the  Senior  Grade  (theoretical) 
and    the    Highest    Grade     (practical)     certificates    in    order    to    claim 

exemption. 

In  the  Second  and  Third  examinations,  between  which  a  year 
must  elapse,  the  requirements  for  Classes  I  and  HI  are,  on  general 
lines  similar  to  those  for  the  first  and  second  Mus.  Bac.  examina- 
tions' respectively.  In  the  case  of  Class  II,  practical  tests  are  sub- 
stituted for  manv  of  the  theoretical  tests.  Candidates  m  Class  111 
will  in  the  final  examination,  have  to  pass  in  "The  Art  of  Teaching 
Music  "  which  will  be  partly  viva  voce  and  partly  paper  work.

latitude  is  allowed  in  the  choice  of  a  second  practical  study.  Total 
exemption  from  examination  in  it  will  be  allowed  if  the  candidate 
possesses  recent  certificates  gained  in  the  higher  grades  of  the  local 
examinations  in   that   subject. 

Those  holding  the  diploma  of  L.  Mus.  can  at  any  time  during 
the  five  years  immediately  following  their  passing  that  examination

DEPARTMENT    OF    PHYSICAL    EDUCATION. 


FOR     MEN. 


Director,  Department  of   Physical  Education  : — Arthur   S.  Lamb, 

B.P.E.,    M.D. 
University  Medical  Officer: — F.  W.  Harvey,  B.A.,  M.D. 

All  students,  on  entering  the  University,  are  required  to  pass  a 
physical  examination  (see  page  66).  By  such  an  examination  any 
physical  defect  or  weakness  may  be  discovered  early,  and  the  student 
will  be  advised  in  regard  to  treatment.  For  those  defects  amenable 
to  treatment  by  exercise  or  other  hygienic  measures,  individual  atten- 
tion will  be  given,  and  the  students  will  be  advised  as  to  what  forms 
of  exercise   will   be  likely   to  prove  beneficial   or   harmful. 

I.     general. 

The  aim  of  the  University  requirements  in  physical  training  is 
the  maintenance  and  improvement  of  the  physical  well-being  of  the 
student  body,  and  the  production  of  graduates  who  are  physically 
as  v.^ell  as  mentally  fitted  for  their  life-work. 

As  voluntary  exercise  is  of  greater  value  than  is  compulsory, 
great  latitude  is  given  the  individual  student  in  his  choice  of  the 
form   which   his   physical   training  will  take. 

The  chief  factors  limiting  this  choice  are  :— 

1.  The  suitability  of  the  exercise  as  a  means  of  physical  training. 

2.  The  physical  fitness  of  the  individual  student  to  take  the  form 
of  exercise  chosen. 

3.  The   possibility   of  effective   supervision. 

4.  The   practicability  of   ensuring   regular   participation. 

The  aim  is  not  to  replace  the  existing  forms  of  University 
athletics,   but    to   assist    in    developing   an    interest    in    these    by   every 

legitimate  means. 

H.     registration. 

I.  At  the  time  of  registration  every  male  student  of  the  first 
three  years  in  the  Faculties  of  Arts,  Medicine,  Dentistry  and  Science, 
and  of  the  first  two  years  in  the  Faculty  of  Law  shall  be  given  a

be  required  to  fill  in  a  card  indicating  his  choice,  as  outlined  in  para- 
graph B.  I.  The  Director  shall  then  decide  as  to  his  physical  fitness 
for  the  forms  chosen  and  shall  inform  the  student  of  his  decision 
and  note  the  same  on  his  card,  which  shall  be  filed  for  reference.

graph B.  2,  any  student  who  desires  to  participate  in  competitive 
athletics,  as  mentioned  in  paragraph  C.  i,  may  be  excused  from  other 
forms  of  exercise  during  the  season  of  training,  providing  that  this 
is  performed  to  the  satisfaction  of-  the  Director. 

3.  If  successful  in  making  a  place  on  the  team,  he  shall  be

own  gymnasium,  however,  this  amount  of  time  may  be  reduced  by 
the  Committee  on  Physical  Education  to  meet  the  exigencies  of 
gymnasium   accommodation. 

2.  A  record  will  be  kept  of  the  attendance  of  every  student  as

3.  Unexcused  absences  up  to  one-eighth  of  the  required  number 
of  periods  shall  be  allowed.  Unexcused  absences  exceeding  one- 
eighth,  but  not  exceeding  one-quarter,  may  be  allowed  if  at  the  end 
of  the  session  the  student  passes  a  special  examination  and  satisfies 
the  Physical  Director  that  he  has  made  sufficient  progress.  Unex- 
cused absences  exceeding  one-fourth  shall  disqualify  a  student.  Such 
students  shall  be  required  to  take  extra  gymnasium  class  work  to  the 
satisfaction  of  the  Director. 

4.  At  regular  intervals  during  each  session  and  also  at  the  end 
of  each  session,  the  Director  of  Physical  Education  shall  furnish  the 
Dean  of  each  Faculty  with  a  list  of  students  who  have  failed  to  meet

women   undergraduates   of  the   fourth   year. 


*  In  all  cases  of  absence  the  student  is  required  to  report  to  the 
Physical  Director .  for  Women.  The  ordinary  interpretation  of  the 
one-eighth  rule  concerning  absences  does  not  apply  m  this  Depart- 
ment. Every  student  is  required  to  wear  the  costume  recommended 
by  the  Department. 


296  MCGILL    SCHOOL   OF    PHYSICAL    EDUCATION 

McGILL  SCHOOL  OF  PHYSICAL  EDUCATION. 

This  school  was  founded  under  the  Teachers'  Training  Committee 
in  June,  1912,  to  train  teachers  of  physical  education  for  school  work, 
recreational  and  social  work. 

In  1914  a  course  was  added  in  massage  and  remedial  gymnastics 
to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  trained  masseuses,  especially  in 
view   of  the  urgent  needs  of   returned   wounded   soldiers. 

In  1919  the  School  was  placed  under  the  control  of  the  University. 

The  courses  provide  a  thorough  all  round  training  extending 
over  two  years,  but  they  are  independent,  and  for  the  present  either 
may  be  taken  separately. 

COURSE     I. — EDUCATIONAL     COURSE. 

Practice  in  Teaching.— Great  stress  is  laid  on  the  practice  of 
teaching.  Owing  to  exceptional  facilities,  every  student  will  be  given 
the  opportunity  to  conduct  classes,  games  and  dances,  with  helpful 
supervision   from  expert  teachers. 

Entrance  Requirements.— It  is  highly  desirable  that  the  teachers 
of  Physical  Education  shall  have  reached  a  good  standard  of  general 
culture,  hence  the  following  will  be  required  for  entrance  to  the 
course:— High  School  Leaving  Certificate,  or  Matriculation,  or  the 
Model  Diploma  of  the  Province  of  Quebec,  or  equivalent  qualifica- 
tion,  at  the   discretion  of  the  Committee. 

Medical  Examination.— AW  students  will  be  required  to  pass  a 
satisfactory  physical   examination   before  proceeding  with   the   course. 

Dj/)/ow!a.— Examinations  will  be  held  in  all  regular  subjects  and 
certificates  will  be  granted  at  the  end  of  each  year  for  work  done. 
Fifty  per  cent,  required  to  pass;  60  per  cent,  for  second  class;  75  per 
cent,  for  first  class;  but  in  all  cases  at  least  60  per  cent,  must  be 
made  on  teaching.  The  Diploma,  granted  on  successful  completion 
of  the  course,  is  recognized  by  the  Protestant  Board  of  School  Com- 
missioners of  Montreal  as  qualifying  for  the  salary  of  specialist  in 
public  schools. 

COURSE    II.^-MASSAGE    AND    REMEDIAL    GVMNASTli^S. 

(For   Hospital   and   Private    JVork.) 

Course  II— offered  Session  1914-1915  for  the  first  time— is  intended 
to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  experts  in  this  important  branch  of 
physical  work.  The  knowledge  of  massage,  remedial  gymnastics  anc' 
the  various  forms  of  physical  therapy  is  more  and  more  recognized 
as  necessary  in  medical  and  educational  practice.  It  has  proved  of 
the  utmost  value  in  the  treatment  of  convalescent  soldiers. 


MCGILL    SCHOOL   OF    PHYSICAL   EDUCATION  297 

The  Course  will  be  of  special  value  to  graduate  nurses  who  wish 
to  obtain  additional  qualifications,  and  to  those  engaged  in  physical 
education. 

The  treatment  of  postural  and  other  defects  of  school  children 
cannot  be  effectively  carried  out  in  large  gymnastic  classes,  but  should 
be  supplied  by  experts  who  can  give  individual  attention  to  such  cases.

MILITARY  TRAINING. 


In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  Federal  Government  has  not  as  yet 
adopted  any  general  policy  with  regard  to  military  training  no  in- 
struction in  military  science  will  be  given  at  McGill  University  during 
the  session  1920-21,  except  perhaps  in  the  Faculty  of  Applied  Science, 
where  an  alternative  may  be  allowed  in  the  fourth  year  between  Field 
Engineering,  Map  Reading  and  Field  Sketching  and  Military  Admi- 
nistration and  Organization  on  the  one  hand  and  certain  selected 
subjects  in  the  several  courses,  as  shown  on  pages  192  to  203. 

CANADIAN     officers'     TRAINING     CORPS. 

(McGill  University  Contingent.) 

In  order  to  provide  undergraduates  with  practical  military  train- 
ing, a  contingent  of  the  Canadian  Officers'  Training  Corps  was 
organized  at  McGill  University  two  years  before  the  war  began,  and 
is  still  being  maintained.  Students  are  thus  afforded  an  opportunity 
of  preparing  themselves  for  service  as  officers  in  the  Canadian  Militia. 
The  contingent  is  a  unit  of  the  active  militia,  being  governed  by 
special  regulations,  under  which  it  cannot  be  called  out  for  active 
•  service  as  a  unit. 

The  training  is  intended  to  bring  the  largest  possible  number  of 
students  up  to  the  standard  required  for  the  two  certificates  (A  and 
B)  of  proficiency.  The  value  of  these  certificates  lies  in  their  being 
a  guarantee  of  consecutive  training  for  two  or  more  years,  of  a  nature 
calculated  to  produce  good  officers.  If  a  member,  who  is  in  posses- 
sion of  a  certificate,  is  recommended  for  a  commission  in  the  Active 
Militia,  this  certificate  entitles  him  to  rank  as  an  officer  without  any 
further  qualification,  and  also  to  certain  other  advantages. 

To  obtain  a  Certificate  (A  or  B)  a  member  must  complete  two 
years  efficient  service  in  the  corps,  and  pass  the  written  and  oral 
examinations  prescribed  for  the  respective  certificates.  To  be  efficient 
in  a  given  year  (ist  August  to  31st  July),  a  member  must  have 
attended  40  parades  if  in  his  first  year  of  service,  or  25  parages  if 
in  a  subsequent  year,  and  must  have  completed  the  prescribed  course 
of  musketry.  The  time  required  is  about  two  hours  per  week  each 
session. 

Each  member,  upon  joining  the  contingent,  will  be  required  to 
deposit  the  sum  of  $5.00  with  the  Adjutant;  for  which  a  receipt  will 
be  given.  This  money  will  be  refunded  if  the  member  becomes  effi- 
cient;   otherwise  it  will  go  into  the   funds   of   the   contingent. 

The  training  in  the  corps  is  of  such  a  nature  that  all  students 
are   recommended   to  join.     Enlistment   is,    however,   purely   voluntary. 


THE  GRADUATE  SCHOOL. 


In  the  Graduate  School  are  enrolled  all  the  graduate  students  in 
the  University  who  are  following  advanced  courses  of  study  in 
subjects  which  in  the  undergraduate  work  fall  within  the  scope  of  the 
Faculties  of  Arts,  Law,  and  Applied  Science. 

The  Faculty  of  the  Graduate  School  consists  of  the  professors  of 
the  Faculties  of  Arts,  Law,  and  Applied  Science,  but  the  initiative  and 
administration  of  the  School  is  placed  in  the  hands  of  a  Committee 
selected  mainly  from  these  Faculties  and  known  as  the  Committee  on 
Graduate  Studies.  The  Chairman  of  this  Committee  is  the  official 
head  of  the  Graduate  School.  The  advanced  courses  of  study  offered 
in  the  Graduate  School  lead  to  the  degrees  of  Master  of  Arts,  Master 
of  Science,  Master  of  Laws,  and  Doctor  of  Philosophy. 

Instruction  for  students  of  the  Graduate  School  is  provided  in  the 
following  departments  of  study  which  at  present  rank  as  "Subjects": 

Philosophy,    including    Psychology.  Chemistry. 

History.  Botany. 

Economics  and  Political  Science.  Zoology. 

Greek    Language    and    Literature    (in-       Geology  and  Mineralogy. 

eluding  Grecian  History).  Thermodynamics   and   Theory   of    Heat 
Latin    Language    and     Literature     (in-  Engines. 

eluding   Roman   History).  Theory      of      Elasticity,      Strength      of 
French    Language    and    Literature.  Materials  and  Theory  of  Structures. 

German    Language    and    Literature.  Hydrodynamics  and   Hydraulics. 

English  Language   and  Literature.  Applied   Electricity. 

Semitic   Studies.  Theory     of     Machines     and     Machine 
Archaeology.  Design.

Physics. 

The  requirements  for  the  several  degrees  in  course  are  as  follows: 

DEGREE  OF  MASTER  OF  ARTS. 
I.     Candidates  must  hold  the  degree  of  B.A.  or  B.Sc.    (in  Arts) 
from  McGill  University,  or  its  equivalent. 


Mining. 
Law. 


300  THE   GRADUATE    SCHOOL 

2.  Candidates  must  have  taken : 

(a)  One  year  of  resident  graduate  study  at  McGill  University; 
or 

(b)  If  graduates  of  McGill  University,  two  or  more  years  of 
private  work;  the  amount  of  such  work  required  may  be 
stated  to  be  the  equivalent  of  one  year  of  academic  study. 

3.  One,  two  or  three  subjects  may  be  taken. 

4.  One  of  these  subjects  shall  be  designated  as  the  major  subject 
and  special  attention  shall  be  devoted  to  it.  It  must  be  a  subject  which 
the  student  has  already  studied  in  his  undergraduate  course,  and  the 
work  required  in  it  will  represent  an  attainment  in  knowledge  far  in 
advance  of  that  required  for  the  B.A.  degree.  The  minor  subject,  or 
subjects,  may  be  selected  from  those  of  the  undergraduate  course  of  the 
third  or  fourth  year  which  have  not  already  been  taken  by  the  candi- 
date. Not  more  than  one-third  of  the  candidate's  time  for  the  year 
shall  be  devoted  to  these  subjects.  The  student  shall  pass  an  examina- 
tion in  each  of  the  subjects  of  his  course. 

In  the  case  of  students  of  first  rank  honour  standing  in  mathe- 
matics and  physics,  if  the  major  work  is  to  be  in  physics,  exemption 
may  be  granted  from  part  of  the  required  attendance  on  lecture  courses, 
on  the  recommendation  of  the  Head  of  the  Department  in  physics  and 
subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies. 

Candidates  holding  the  ordinary  B.A.  degree  must  have  taken  all 
the  ordinary  undergraduate  courses,  or  their  equivalents,  in  the  subjects 
which  they  select  as  their  major. 

5.  The  student  shall  also  present  a  thesis  on  some  topic  connected 
with  his  major  subject.  The  title  of  his  thesis  must  have  been  pre- 
viously submitted  to  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies  and  the  Head 
of  the  Department  concerned  for  their  approval.  The  thesis  must 
show  evidence  of  distinct  ability  in  dealing  with  the  subject  selected, 
and  must  also  display  good  literary  style. 

6.  Graduates  possessing  a  Bachelor's  degree,  who  act  as  demon- 
strators or  tutors  in  the  University  for  the  entire  session,  may  proceed 
to  the  degree  of  M.A.,  and,  in  so  doing,  may,  at  the  discretion  of  the 
Department  with  which  they  are  connected,  and  the  Committee  on 
Graduate  Studies,  omit  a  portion  of  the  course  of  study.  They  shall, 
however,  be  called  upon  to  pass  an  examination  on  the  course  of  study 
which  they  have  followed,  and  shall  in  all  cases  submit  the  thesis 
prescribed  for  that  degree.  If,  however,  they  desire  this  year's  work 
to  count  as  one  of  the  three  years  of  study  required  for  the  Ph.D 
degree,  they  must  make  their  course  of  *tudy  conform  to  the  Ph.D 
requirements. 


THE    GRADUATE    SCHOOL  3OI 

N.B.— The  first  year's  course  of  study  for  the  Ph.D.  degree  will 
cover  the  requirements  of  the  M.A.  course ;  but  if  such  a  course  of 
study  be  followed,  a  thesis  must  be  submitted  and  approved  before  the 
degree  of  M.A.  is  conferred.  If,  however,  the  student  continues  his 
course  of  study  and  takes  the  degree  of  Ph.D.,  the  degree  of  M.A.  will 
be  conferred  with  the  degree  of  Ph.D.,  in  which  case  no  special  thesis 
will  be  required  for  the  former. 

DEGREE  OF  MASTER  OF  SCIENCE. 

1.  Candidates  must  hold  the  degree  of  B.A.  or  B.Sc.  from  McGill 
University,  or  its  equivalent. 

2.  Candidates  must  have  taken 

(a)  One  year  of  resident  graduate  study  at  McGill  University; 
or 

(b)  If  graduates  of  McGill  University,  two  or  more  years  of 
private  work;  the  amount  of  such  work  required  may  be 
stated  to  be  the  equivalent  of  one  year  of  academic  study. 

3.  The  course  of  study  followed  by  the  candidate  shall  be  of  an 
advanced  character,  being  the  equivalent  of  that  required  for  the  degree 
of  M.A.,  and  shall  lie  in  the  domain  of  pure  or  applied  science.  It 
shall  be  selected  from  one  of  the  last  thirteen  subjects  in  the  list  given 
above.  Geodesy  and  ore  dressing  also  constitute  subjects  in  the  case 
of  this  degree.  This  course  of  study  must  have  been  previously  sub- 
mitted to  the  Head  of  the  Department  and  to  the  Committee  on  Grad- 
uate Studies  and  have  received  their  approval. 

In  the  case  of  students  of  first  rank  honour  standing  in  mathe- 
matics and  physics,  if  the  major  work  is  to  be  in  physics,  exemption 
may  be  granted  from  part  of  the  required  attendance  on  lecture  courses, 
on  the  recommendation  of  the  Head  of  the  Department  in  physics  and 
subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies. 

4.  The  candidate  shall  also  present  a  thesis  on  some  subject  con- 
nected with  his  course  of  study.  The  title  of  this  thesis  must  have  been 
previously  submitted  to  the  Head  of  the  Department  and  to  thie  Com- 
mittee on  Graduate  Studies  and  have  received  their  approval.  This 
thesis  must  show  evidence  of  distinct  ability  in  dealing  with  the  subjects 
selected  and  must  also  display  good  literary  style.  It  may  deal  with 
some  special  topic,  but  the  course  of  study  followed  by  the  student  must 
cover  a  much  wider  field. 

5.  Graduates  possessing  a  Bachelor's  degree  who  act  as  demon- 
strators or  tutors  in  the  University  for  at  least  one  entire  session,  may 
proceed  to  the  degree  of  M.Sc,  and,  on  so  doing,  may,  at  the  discre- 
tion of  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies,  omit  a  portion  of  the  course 


302  THE    GRADUATE    SCHOOL 

of  study  usually  required.  They  shall,  however,  be  called  upon  to 
pass  an  examination  on  the  course  of  study  which  they  have  followed, 
and  shall  in  all  cases  submit  the  thesis  prescribed  for  the  degree. 

DEGREE  OF  MASTER  OF  LAWS  (LL.M.) 
Candidates  must  (i)  hold  the  degree  of  B.C.L.  or  LL.B.,  from 
McGill  University,  or  its  equivalent,  or  be  graduates  of  an  approved 
law  school ;  (2)  have  pursued  for  one  year  a  course  of  resident  study 
at  McGill  University  and  must  have  submitted  a  thesis  of  conspicuous 
merit  upon  a  subject  previously  approved  by  the  Faculty  of  Law  and 
by  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies,  and  must  have  passed  such 
examination  as  may  be  prescribed. 

Applications  to  be  admitted  to  study  under  this  section  must  be 
made  to  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies,  with  particulars  of  the 
proposed  thesis,  not  later  than  the  ist  of  February  of  the  year  in 
which  the  candidate  proposes  to  enter  upon  his  course  of  study.  A 
printed  or  typewritten  copy  of  the  thesis  must  be  delivered  to  the 
Dean  of  the  Faculty  of  Law  for  transmission  to  the  Committee  on 
Graduate  Studies  not  later  than  the  ist  of  April  of  the  year  in  which 
the  candidate  proposes  to  proceed  to  the  degree. 

DEGREE  OF  DOCTOR  OF  PHILOSOPHY.

tion given  during  the  entire  course. 

4.  The  candidate  must  satisfy  the  Committee  that  he  has  a  read- 
ing knowledge  of  both  French  and  German  before  he  will  be  permitted 
to  enter  upon  the  course  of  the  second  year. 

5.  The  examination  on  the  major  subjects  shall  cover  not  merely 
the  formal  courses  of  instruction  which  have  been  taken,  but  the 
candidate  must  show  that  he  possesses  a  good  general  knowledge  of 
the  whole  science  or  branch  of  learning  which  he  has  selected  as  his 
major  subject.  A  similar  general,  though  less  detailed,  knowledge 
shall  be  required  in  the  case  of  the  minor  subject. 

6.  The  candidate  must  also  prepare  a  thesis  which  must  display 
original  scholarship  or  show  marked  ability  to  conduct  research.  If

THE   GRADUATE   SCHOOL  303 

deposited  with  the  University  Librarian  before  the  candidate  will 
receive  his   diploma. 

The  University  exacts  a  very  high  standard  in  the  case  of  this 
degree,  and  at  least  three  years  of  study  are  therefore  demanded. 

A  three  years'  course  leading  to  the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Philosophy 
is  offered  in  the  following  subjects  taken  as  majors:— 

Botany. 

French. 

Philosophy. 

Physics. 

Chemistry. 

Semitic   Studies. 

Students  desiring  to  proceed  to  the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Philosophy 
in  subjects  other  than  those  mentioned  above  may  communicate  with 
the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies,  to  whom  also 
applications  should  be  made  by  all  students  desiring  to  follow  courses 
of  study  in  the  Graduate  School. 

DEGREE  OF  DOCTOR  OF  CIVIL  LAW. 

Any  person  who  has  graduated  as  B.C.L.  or  as  LL.M.  from 
McGill  University. may  after  five  years  from  such  graduation  proceed 
to  the  degree  of  Doctor  of  Civil  Law,  provided  that  he  shall  have 
written  a  thesis  on  a  subject  previously  approved  by  the  Faculty  of 
Law  and  by  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies,  and  that  such 
thesis  shall  have  been  adjudged  by  the  Faculty  of  Law  and  by  the 
Committee  on  Graduate  Studies  to  be  a  valuable  contribution  to  legal 
science.  The  candidate  may,  instead  of  a  thesis,  submit  to  the  Com- 
mittee on  Graduate  Studies  a  published  book  or  books  dealing  in  a 
scientific  way  with  some  branch  or  branches  of  law,  and  in  that  case 
no  previous  approval  is  required.  Three  printed  or  type-written  copies 
of  the  thesis  or  three  copies  of  the  book  or  books,  as  the  case  may 
be,  must  be  delivered  to  the  Dean  of  the  Faculty  of  Law  for  trans- 
mission to  the  Committee  on  Graduate  Studies  not  later  than  the  ist 
of  February  of  the  year  in  which  the  candidate  proposes  to  proceed 
to  the  degree. 

THESES. 

Owing  to  the  fact  that  in  future  all  theses  submitted  by  successful 
candidates  for  higher  degrees  will  be  bound  and  placed  in  the  Redpath 
Library,  candidates  for  such  degrees  are  advised  that  the  Committee 
on  Graduate  Studies  will  henceforth  require  all  theses  to  be  prepared  in 
a  uniform  manner  and  in  accordance  with  the  following  specifications  : 

1st.— The  paper  is  to  be  of  uniform  size,  about  S%  x  10  inches,  and 
of  substantial  qualit)'.

tatives of  the  Faculty  of  Arts,  elected  by  the  Faculty ;  one  represen- 
tative of  each  of  the  Faculties  of  Applied  Science,  Law  and  Medicine, 
elected  by  their  respective  Faculties;  and  four  other  members 
appointed  by   Corporation. 

The  several  libraries  of  the  University  now  contain  165,657 
volumes,  over  25,000  pamphlets,  considerable  collections  of  maps  and 
photographs,  and  a  number  of  the  rarer  and  more  costly  monographs 
and  serials  which  are  indispensable  for  purposes  of  research.  There 
are  now  on  the  shelves  over  300  complete  files  of  periodicals  and 
publications  of  various  literary  and  scientific  societies. 

Among  the  special  collections  possessed  by  the  Library  may  be 
mentioned  the  Mendelssohn  Choir  Memorial  Collection  of  Works  on 
Music,  the  T.  D.  King  Collection  of  Shakespeariana,  the  Redpath 
Historical  Collection,  and  the  Collection  of  Canadiana.  The  nucleus 
of  the  latter  is  formed  by  the  choice  library  of  the  late  Mr.  Frederick 
Griffin,  which  he  bequeathed  to  the  University  about  forty  years  ago. 
It  has  been  growing  ever  since,  and  includes,  at  the  present  time, 
besides  numerous  manuscripts,  an  interesting  collection  of  Canadian 
portraits  and  autographs.  The  Canadiana  have  been  further  enriched 
by  the  recent  gift  of  over  270  volumes  and  50  pamphlets  from  the 
library  of  the  late  Mr.  William  McLennan,  presented  in  his  memory 
by  his  children. 

The  Redpath  Historical  Collection  was  begun  by  the  late  Mr. 
Peter  Redpath  soon  after  he  became  a  Governor  of  the  University. 
It  received  substantial  yearly  additions  from  him  up  to  the  year  of 
his  death,  after  which  it  was  steadily  augmented  during  the  remainder 
of  her  life  by  his  widow.  It  is  now  large  and  valuable,  and  affords 
excellent  opportunities  for  the  study  of  history.  Its  most  striking 
feature— a  series  of  political,  religious  and  social  tracts,  for  which 
the  first  selections  were  made  by  the  late  Professor  Henry  Morley— 
was  greatly  enriched  by  the  late  Mrs.  Redpath,  and  at  present  com- 
prises about  10,000  brochures,  dating  from  1600  A.D.  to  the  end  of 
the  nineteenth  century. 

A  special  Architectural  collection,  to  be  known  as  the  "  Gordon 
Home   Blackader   Memorial   Library,"   has   been   established   in   honour 


306  THE    UNIVERSITY    LIBRARY 

of  Captain  Gordon  Home  Blackader,  B.Arch.  (McGill),  who  was 
wounded  near  Ypres  on  Jnne  2nd.  1916,  and  died  in  London  on 
August   20th   of  the   same   year. 

"  The  Emma  Shearer  Wood  Library  of  Ornithology "  is  being 
presented  by  Colonel  Casey  A.  Wood,  M.D.,  as  a  special  research 
collection  for  use  by  all  who  are  interested   in  birds. 

The  Medical  Library,  directly  controlled  by  the  Faculty  of  Medi- 
cine, is  the  largest  of  the  departmental  libraries,  and  is  one  of  the 
most  complete  collections  of  its  kind  in  the  Dominion. 

Current  periodicals,  with  Transactions  and  other  Society  publica- 
tions to  the  number  of  about  400  in  the  aggregate,  are  regularly 
received  by   the   Library. 

Founded  in  1900,  as  a  memorial  to  the  late  Mr.  Hugh  McLennan 
from  his  children,  the  Travelling  Libraries  of  McGill  University  were 
endowed  in  191 1,  by  their  founders.  These  libraries  contain,  each, 
from  thirty  to  forty  carefully  selected  volumes ;  and  are  sent,  on 
application,  and  on  payment  of  a  nominal  fee  of  $4.00,  to  schools, 
to  country  libraries,  to  reading  clubs,  and  to  small  communities  which 
possess  no  public  library.  Regulations  and  full  particulars  may  be 
obtained  from  the  Librarian  of  the  University. 

Although  the  Library  is  maintained  primarily  for  members  of 
the  University,  the  Corporation  has  provided  for  admission,  'upon 
certain  conditions,  of  such  persons  as  may  be  approved  by  the  Library 
Committee.  It  is  the  desire  of  the  Committee  to  make  the  Library 
as  useful  to  the  entire  community  as  is  consistent  with  the  safety  of 
the  books  and  the  general  interests  of  the  University.

THE    ROYAL    VICTORIA    COLLEGE. 

Founded   and   Endowed   by   the   late   Rt.    Hon.   Baron   Strathcona 
and  Mount  Royal. 


FOUNDATION   AND   HISTORY. 

The  College  was  opened  September  4th,   1899. 

It  is  the  outgrowth  of  plans  conceived  during  the  early  years  of 
his  Principalship  by  the  late  Sir  William  Dawson,  which  resulted  in 
the  establishment  of  the  Ladies'  Elducational  Association.  Under  the 
auspices  of  the  Association,  courses  of  lectures,  delivered  chiefly  by 
Professors  of  McGill  University,  were  offered  to  women  from  1870 
until  1884.  thus  placing  within  their  reach,  to  some  extent  at  least, 
the  advantages  of  a  Collegiate  and  University  education. 

In  1884,  during  the  principalship  of  the  late  Sir  William  Dawson, 
the  late  Lord  Strathcona,  then  Mr.  Donald  A.  Smith,  gave  a  sum  of 
$50,000,  and,  in  1887.  a  further  sum  of  $70,000,  to  found  the  Donalda 
Endowment  for  the  higher  education  of  women,  such  education  to 
be  conducted  in  the  buildings  of  McGill  College,  as  a  distinct  course 
in  the  Faculty  of  Arts,  with  the  understanding  that  as  .soon  as  prac- 
ticable the  classes  were  to  be  created  into  a  separate  college  of  McGill 
University,  with  a  building  separate  from  that  of  McGill  College. 
Under  the  terms  of  the  Donalda  Endowment  it  was  provided  that 
degrees  in  the  Faculty  of  Arts  should  be  granted  to  women  practically 
on  the  same  conditions  as  to  men,  and  that  the  examinations  for  such 
degrees,  for  classing,  honours,  prizes  and  medals  should  be  identical 
with  those  for  men. 

As  a  result  of  this  generous  gift  and  in  accordance  with  the  con- 
ditions attached,  courses  of  instruction,  identical  in  subject  and  in 
standard  with  those  of  the  Faculty  of  Arts,  were  established  for 
women  in  1884.  These  courses  were  given  in  the  Arts  Building,  some 
of  the  work  of  the  third  and  fourth  years  and  of  the  Honour  Courses 
being  conducted  in  joint  classes. 

The  first  graduating  class  of  eight  women  was  presented  for  the 
degree  of  Bachelor  of  Arts  in  1888. 

The  ultimate  object  of  Lord  Strathcona  had  been  the  provision 
of  a  residential  college,  and  this  was  realized  when  the  Royal  Victoria 
College  was  opened  in  1899,  and  formally  inaugurated  by  their  Majes- 
ties the  King  and  Queen  (then  Duke  and  Duchess  of  York)   in  1901. 


THE   ROYAL   VICTORIA    COLLEGE  309 

The  College  building,  surrounded  by  garden  and  tennis  courts, 
was  erected  at  a  cost  of  about  $400,000  at  the  head  of  Union  Avenue. 
upon  land  adjacent  to  the  University  Campus.  Its  beautiful  and  dig- 
nified exterior  was  designed  in  consistency  with  a  careful  and  generous 
internal  provision  of  a  comfortable  and  gracious  place  of  study  and 
dwelling  for  students  and  for  staff.  A  Warden  and  Resident  Staff 
were  appointed.  With  these  new  and  great  advantages  the  instruction 
provided  by  the  original  endowment  has  been  maintained  as  hitherto, 
except  that  the  separate  classes  are  held  mainly  in  the  College  building. 
Women  have  continued  to  prepare  for  degrees  in  Arts,  including  pure 
science.  Through  the  wisdom  of  Lord  Strathcona,  provision  was  also 
made  for  the  study  of  music.  Since,  however,  the  establishment  of 
music  as  a  separate  department  of  the  University  in  the  Conserva- 
torium  of  Music,  independent  instruction  in  music  in  the  College  has 
ceased,  but  it  still  maintains  a  resident  lecturer  in  this  subject,  who 
is  also  Vice-Director  of  the  Conservatorium.  The  interest  of  College 
students  in  music  is  thereby  served  and  provided  for.  Women  students 
resident  in  the  Royal  Victoria  College  may  take  degree  courses  in 
music  at  the  Conservatorium. 

THE  COLLEGE  BUILDING. 

The  building  provides  an  academic,  administrative  and  recrea- 
tional centre  for  resident  and  non-resident  students.  It  is  situated  on 
Sherbrooke  Street,  in  close  proximity  to  the  University  buildings, 
and  within  easy  reach  of  Mount  Royal  Park.  The  building  is  fire- 
proof, and  much  thought  and  artistic  care  have  been  given  to  furnish- 
ing and  decoration. 

On  the  ground  floor  are  the  offices  of  the  Administration,  including 
the  rooms  of  the  Warden  and  Secretary,  the  faculty  room,  the  students" 
common  room,  a  spacious  dining  hall,  and  three  lecture  rooms.  On 
the  first  floor  are  other  lecture  rooms,  the  library,  reading  room,  and 
a  handsome  assembly  hall,  which  is  used  for  convocation,  Conserva- 
torium concerts,  and  other  University  purposes.  This  hall  is  some- 
times lent  for  purposes  that  are  in  harmony  with  the  objects  of  the 
College.  The  gallery,  which  is  reserved  exclusively  for  the  use  of 
College  students  on  such  occasions,  affords  the  latter  many  oppor- 
tunities of  educational  value.  The.  second  and  third  floors  and  a 
small  part  of  the  first  floor  are  occupied  by  the  rooms  of  the  Resident 
Staff  and  students.  Each  student  has  a  separate  study-bedroom.  If 
accommodation  permits,  a  student  may  be  assigned  two  rooms,  a 
study  and  a  bedroom.  The  rooms  are  completely  furnished,  and  no 
article  of  furniture  need  be  brought  by  the  studenls. 

A  large  gymnasium  is  provided,  fully-equipped  with  modern 
requirements.  In  connection  with  the  gymnasium  are  bath-rooms  and 
dressing-rooms. 


3IO  THE  ROYAL  VICTORIA  COLLEGE 

Resident  students  of  music  have  the  use  of  pianos  in  two  prac- 
tising rooms  and  at  certain  hours  in  other  parts  of  the  building. 

The  lawn  behind  the  College  building  provides  lawn  tennis  courts 
in  the  summer  and  a  skating  rink  in  the  winter.  Subject  to  regula- 
tions, the  students  have  the  privilege  of  using  the  University  grounds. 
Each  student  paying  the  Grounds  Fee  receives  a  ticket  giving  admis- 
sion to  the  Campus  skating  rink  during  certain  afternoon  hours  daily 
except  Saturdays.

PHYSICAL  EDUCATION. 

Physical  Director: — A.  S.  Lamb,  B.P.E.,  M.D. 

University    Medical   Officer: — F.    W.    Harvey,    B.A.,    M.D. 

Physical  Director  for  Women  : — Miss  Ethel  M.  Cartvvright, 

Chelsea  College  of  Physical  Education. 

Assistant  : — Miss   Georgina  M.  Wood,  Chelsea  College  of 

Physical    Education. 

Every  student  on  entering  the  College  is  required  to  pass  a 
physical  examination. 

The  physical  education  offered  to  undergraduate  students  includes 
educational,  remedial  and  recreative  gymnastics. 

The  educational  gymnastics  are  based  on  anatomical  and  physio- 
logical laws ;  the  exercises  aim  at  producing  the  highest  degree  of 
health  in  each  individual,  and  thus  contribute  to  mental  as  well  as  to 
physical  efficiency.  The  course  of  exercise,  which  is  progressive 
throughout  each  session,  encourages  the  harmonious  development  of 
the  nervous  and  muscular  system,  and  provides  a  remedy  for  incorrect 
habits  of  sitting,  standing  and  walking.  Special  attention  is  given  to 
the  development  of  the  chest,  since  a  good  lung  capacity  is  the  founda- 
tion of  a  really  healthy  constitution.     A   remedial  gymnastic  course   is 


THE   ROYAL   VICTORIA    COLLEGE  313

The  Centre  Building. — This  is  the  oldest  building  of  the  group. 
It  contains  the  lecture  rooms  of  the  Faculty  of  Arts,  as  well  as  the 
botanical  and  zoological  laboratories  and  the  offices  of  the  adminis-

the  ground  floor  are  the  offices  of  the  Director  and  of  the  Secretary, 
the  library  and  a  concert  hall  where  recitals  by  the  stafif  and  students 
are  given  during  the  session  and  where  orchestral  and  choral  prac- 
tices are  held  (the  more  important  concerts  take  place  in  the  large 
assembly  hall  of  the  Royal  Victoria  College).  The  second  and  third 
floors  contain  a  number  of  studios,  where  lessons  are  given  by  the 
various  members  of  the  staflf,  as  well  as  a  room  for  lectures  in

large  central  light  well.  Each  floor  is  furnished  with  free  stacks 
and  wall  cases  made  of  steel  and  plate  glass  thoroughly  dust-proof. 
The  anatomical  collections  are  placed  on  the  third  floor,  while  the 
first  and  second  floors  are  devoted  to  pathology.  In  both  the  anato- 
mical and  pathological  sections  of  the  museum  the  specimens  have

of  experimental  psychology,  including  physiological  psychology,  edu- 
cational psychology,  and  applied  psychology.  Second,  it  Js  used  to 
acquaint  beginners  with  the  methods  of  experimental  psychology,  both 
qualitative  and  quantitative.  Third,  it  furnishes  material  for  experi- 
mental demonstration  in  the  elementary  and  advanced  lecture  courses. 

STRENGTH   OF   MATERIALS    LABORATORIES. 

These  laboratories  are  equipped  with  apparatus  for  the  deter- 
mination of  the  physical  properties  of  the  materials  of  construction 
and  for  illustrating  the  fundamental  laws  of  the  strength  of  materials. 
The  equipment  includes  : — 

(a)  Riehle  testing  machine  of  60,000  lbs.  capacity,  a  Wicksteed 
IOC-ton,  a  Wicksteed  50-ton,  and  an  Emery  7S-ton  machine  for  testing 
the  tensile,  compressive  and  transverse  strength  of  the  several  mate- 
rials of  construction.     To  the  Wicksteed  has  been  added   a  specially 


LABORATORIES  339 

designed  arrangement,  by  which  the  transverse  strength  of  girders 
and  beams  up  to  26  ft.  in  length  can  be  determined.  Special  holders 
have  also  been  designed  and  made  in  the  laboratory  for  investigating 
the  tensile  and  shearing  strength  of  timber,  and  for  the  testing  of 
wire  ropes,  belts,  etc.  An  Olsen  machine  of  10,000  lbs.  capacity  is 
used  for  testing  wire. 

(b)  A  Rondet-Schor  Machine,  with  a  capacity  of  500  kilograms, 
for   testing   textile   fabrics. 

(c)  A  Torsion  Machine  with  a  specially  designed  angle  measurer, 
by  which  the  amount  of  the  torsion  can  be  measured  with  extreme 
accuracy.  ~ 

(d)  An  accumulator,  furnishing  a  pressure  of  3,600  lbs.  per 
square  inch,  which  is  transmitted  to  the  several  testing  machines,  and 
ensures  a  perfectly  steady  application  of  stress,  an  impossibility  when 
any  form  of  pump  is  substituted  for  an  accumulator.  An  automatic 
electric  motor  has  been  designed  in  the  laboratory  and  constructed 
for  the  purpose  of  actuating  the  accumulator. 

(e)  A  Blake  and  Worthington  steam  pump  an'd  an  electric  pump, 
designed  to  work  against  a  pressure  of  3,600  lbs.  per  square  inch. 
The  accumulator  may  be  actuated  by  any  of  the  pumps,  and,  if  at 
any  time  it  is  necessary  to  do  so,  any  of  the  pumps  may  be  employed 
to  actuate  the  testing  machine  direct.  When  in  operation,  the  work 
of  the  pump  and  the  accumulator  is  automatic. 

(/)  Extensometers  of  the  Bovey,  Ewing,  Unwin,  Martens,  Mar- 
shall and  other  types. 

(g)  Portable  cathetometers,  and  also  a  large  cathetometer  spe- 
cially designed  and  constructed  for  the  determination  of  the  exten- 
sions, compressions  and  deflections  of  the  specimens  under  stress  in 
the    testing    machines. 

(h)  Various  electric  motors  fo'  working  the  several  machines. 

(0  A  drying  oven  for  beams  up  to  26  feet  in  length.  The  hot 
air  in  this  oven  is  kept  in  circulation  by  means  of  a  fan  driven  by 
an  electric  motor. 

(/)  Numerous  gauges,  amongst  which  may  be  specially  noticed 
an  Emery  pressure  gauge,  graduated  in  single  lbs.  up  to  2,500  lbs. 
per  square  inch.  All  of  the  testing  machines  are  on  the  same  pressure 
circuit,  and  are  connected  with  the  Emery  gauge  and  also  other 
standard  gauges,  including  recording  gauges.  This  arrangement  pro- 
vides a  practically  perfect  means  of  checking  the  accuracy  of  the 
testing. 

(k)  Special  apparatus  and  recording  gauge  for  the  testing  of 
hose,   etc. 

(/)  Dynamometers  for  measuring  the  strength  of  textile  fabrics,

THE   peter   REDPATH    MUSEUM. 

Honorary  Curator: — Prof.  Arthur  Willey. 
Curator: — E.  Ardley. 

The  large  and  valuable  collections  in  botany,  zoology,  mineralogy 
and  geology  are  arranged  in  such  a  manner  as  to  facilitate  the  work 
in  these  departments. 

The  general  arrangement  is  as  follows : — 

1.  The  botanical  room  on  the  ground  floor  contains  the  herbarium, 
consis'ting  of  50,000  specimens  of  Canadian  and  exotic  plants  and  col- 
lections illustrating  structural  and  economic  botany. 

2.  In  the  corridor  on  the  ground  floor  is  exhibited  the  Todd  Ethno- 
graphical Collection  from  West  Africa. 

3.  The  Lyman  entomological  room  is  also  situated  on  the  ground 
floor.  Mr.  A.  F.  Winn  is  the  entomological  curator  under  the  Lyman 
Bequest. 

4.  On  the  first  floor  is  a  room  over  the  entrance  hall,  in  which  are 
cases  containing  archaeological  and  ethnological  objects,  including  col- 
lections from  the  Queen  Charlotte  Islands,  from  Egypt,  and  from  West 
Africa. 

5.  This  room  opens  into  the  great  museum  hall,  on  each  side  of 
which  are  alcoves  with  upright  and  table  cases  containing  the  collec- 
tion in  palaeontology  arranged  primarily  to  illustrate  the  successive 
geological  systems,  and  subordinately  to  this,  in  the  order  of  zoological 
and   botanical   classification,   so   as   to   enable   the   student   to   see  the 


MUSEUMS  343 

general  order  of  life  in  successive  periods,  and  to  trace  any  particular 
group  through  its  geological  history. 

6.  At  the  extreme  end  of  the  hall  are  placed  the  collections  of 
minerals  and  rocks,  arranged  in  such  a  manner  as  to  facilitate  their 
systematic  study.  In  the  centre  of  the  hall  are  economic  collections 
and  large  casts  and  models. 

7.  In  the  upper  story  or  gallery  of  the  great  hall  are  placed  the 
zoological  collections ;  the  invertebrate  animals  -in  table  cases  in  regular 
series,  beginning  with  the  lower  forms ;  the  vertebrate  animals  in 
upright  cases,  in  similar  order.  The  Phillip  Carpenter  Collection 
of  shells  is  especially  notewojrthy  for  its  arrangement  and  com- 
pleteness. 

Papers  and  memoirs  relating  to  certain  type  specimens  in  the 
collections  can  be  obtained  from  the  Assistant  Curator.  Classes  of 
pupils  from  schools  can  be  admitted  on  certain  days  under  regulations 
which  may  be  learned  from  the  professors  or  from  the  Registrar  of 
the  University. 

THE  MCCORD   NATIONAL  MUSEUM 

This  Museum  is  located  in  the  old  Joseph  House,  at  the  corner 
of  Sherbrooke  and  McTavish  Streets.  The  collection  is  a  gift  to  the 
University  from  Mr.  David  Ross  McCord  of  Temple  Grove,  a  gra- 
duate in  Arts  of  1863,  and  in  Law  of  1867.  The  range  of  the  col- 
lection is  most  extensive,  comprising,  as  it  does,  mementoes  of  the 
great  statesmen,  warriors,  writers,  and  spiritual  leaders  among  the 
two  principal  races  which  are  now  represented  in  Canada,  as  well 
as  of  the  great  explorers  of  every  part  of  the  North  American  con- 
tinent. The  Arctic  souvenirs  are  especially  numerous  and  important, 
and  in  the  department  of  Wolfiana,  the  Museum  is  probably  unri- 
valled. 

One  of  the  most  important  departments  is  that  treating  of  the 
North  American  Indian,  the  section  relating  to  the  Indians  of  the 
Eastern  half  of  the  continent  being  especially  complete.  Here  are 
to  be  seen  the  arms  and  personal  relics  of  Tecumseh  and  Brant,  and 
most  wonderful  specimens  of  wampum  and  Indian  silver.  The  great 
series  of  paintings  illustrative  of  the  campaigns  and  archaeology  of 
Canada  are  not  only  accurate,  but  artistic.  There  are  separate  depart- 
ments for  china,  glass  and  historical  furniture  as  well  as  one  for 
the  cradle  industries  of  Canada.  There  is  a  special  room  for  relics 
of  the  Founder  of  the  University,  and  of  its  first  great  Principal, 
Sir  Wm.  Dawson,  with  his  distinguished  colleagues  in  Science  at 
the  time.   Sir  William  Logan  and  Dr.  Sterry  Hunt. 

A  special  aim  of  the  Museum  is  to  form  a  school  of  useful  and 
ornamental  art,  based  on  types  of  native  Indian  industry,  such  as  the 
manufacture  of  wall  papers,  works  in  metals  of  all  kinds,  and  ceramic 
work,  in  the  motifs  for  which  the  Museum  is  especially  rich.

ting machine,  one  16-inch  shaper,  one  universal  grinding  machine,  cen- 
tering machine,  a  cutter  grinder,  a  tool  grinder,  and  an  inch  vertical 
drilling  machine  with  compound  table,  one  universal  buffing  and 
emery  grinding  machine.  There  are  vise  benches  for  eighteen  stu- 
dents, with  the  necessary  hand-tools,  and  a  marking-off  table.  The 
tool-room  contains  a  full  equipment  of  drills,  reamers,  milling  cut- 
ters, and  accessories,  gauges,  calipers,  and  other  measuring  instru- 
ments. 

All  the  machinery  in  the  workshops  is  driven  electrically  by 
motors  taking  power  from  the  generating  station  in  the  Macdonald 
Building.
