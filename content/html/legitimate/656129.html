<P>Known throughout Latin America, Rincon is a highly accomplished journalist, and television and radio host and producer. Among her career highlights, from 1996 to 2001 Rincon was host of Nuestra Manana, a daily three-hour live morning show. During this time, Rincon became known as The Home Executive. In addition to her subsequent television work, Rincon was editor and publisher of El Rincon de Rebecca, a successful magazine targeted to the active and creative woman.</P>

<P>Rincon has written three books yet to be released: "1, 2, 3 Rebecca Cooking," "1, 2, 3 Rebecca Simple Solutions" and "1, 2, 3 Rebecca Interior Design."</P>

<P>In Casa Club TV's original production, Entre Petalos y Ramas, South Florida celebrity floral stylist Israel Sands teaches viewers his process for creating exotic and modern arrangements for all occasions. Viewers learn how to adapt Sands's designs to different flowers, and how to apply design principles to flowers to express an aesthetic. Since the show's debut in May 2001, Casa Club TV has produced 78 half-hour episodes along with Sands, who also writes and produces. The show is shot on location in homes and businesses across South Florida.</P>

<P>Casa Club TV's original production Hogar y Armonia teaches viewers the principles of feng shui, from its origins to its applications around the world. Since the show's debut in April 2002, Casa Club TV has produced 26 half-hour episodes of this unique program starring Venezuelan-born Luisa Villegas-Lovera and Anabel Gracia.
