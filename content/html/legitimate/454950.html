Wilcox and Bush’s speeches drew the attention of Marshal of the Kingdom <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("99597",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("99597")' href="/topics/Charles_Burnett_Wilson_(marshal)">Charles Wilson</a><span class="hp" id="m99597"><div class="hpHeader">Charles Burnett Wilson (marshal)</div><div class="hpContent">Charles Burnett “C.B.” Wilson  was a British and Tahitian superintendent of the water works and fire chief under King Kalākaua, and was Marshal of the Kingdom under Queen Liliuokalani. and father of John H.

In response he put the Kingdom under high alert and sandbagged [[ʻIolani Palace]] (hence the name of the incident), effectively divert the attempt. In response by the League to the Kingdom’s lockdown, they aborted the coup and no event occurred. To the public the heightened alertness appeared to have no basis, since no confrontation happened, making Wilson look like a paranoid fool (hence the name of the conspiracy).<br />
<H3>Aftermath</H3>
Wilson raided the League on May 20 arresting and jailing more than a dozen conspirators including Wilcox for plotting to overthrow the government.  Wilcox spent 36 days in jail and was not convicted leading to his release. Ministers to the queen felt that the exposing of the conspiracy made it harmless. The conspiracy was received by Liliuokalani as one of many voices demanding the removal of the 1887 Constitution, subsequently she drafted the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("74284",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("74284")' href="/topics/1893_Constitution_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hawaii">1893 Constitution</a><span class="hp" id="m74284"><div class="hpHeader">1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii</div><div class="hpContent">The 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii was a proposed replacement of the Constitution of 1887, primarily based on the Constitution of 1864 put forth by Queen Lili'uokalani...</div><br></span>.<br />
<H2>1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii</H2>
In 1895, Wilcox participated in another attempt, this time to overthrow the Republic of Hawaiʻi and to restore Liliuokalani to power. Royalist supporters landed a cargo of arms and ammunition from San Francisco, California in a secret Honolulu location. At the location on January 6, 1895, a company of royalists met to draft plans to capture the government buildings by surprise. A premature encounter with a squad of police alarmed Honolulu and the plans were abandoned as the royalists were quickly routed. Wilcox spent several days in hiding in the mountains before being captured. The son of one pro-annexationist was killed. Several other skirmishes occurred during the following week resulting in the capture of the leading conspirators and their followers. The government allegedly found arms and ammunition and some potentially evidential documents on the premises of Washington Place, Liliʻuokalani's private residence implicating her in the plot.<br />
