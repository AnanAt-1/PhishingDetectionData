<H2>A POEM OF SOLIDARITY<BR>
FOR THE STRIKING LIVERPOOL DOCKERS<BR>
AND THE WOMEN ON THE WATERFRONT</H2>
<BR>
<P>Today is May Day, International Workers Holiday<BR>
We celebrate the struggles of workers<BR>
over 100 years ago<BR>
when the eight-hour work day was won<BR>
<BR>
<P>Today is May Day, International Workers Holiday<BR>
We salute you, striking Liverpool dockers<BR>
We salute you, Women on the Waterfront<BR>
Your names are Collette Melia and Susan Mitchell<BR>
Your other names we don't know<BR>
Your other names could be Mary, Jean, Nancy<BR>
Barbara, Josie, Maude, Leila, Elizabeth,<BR>
but hear us sing our praise for you<BR>
our brothers and sisters across the waters<BR>
we working women and men in these United States<BR>
<BR>
<P>Where it's supposed to be a land of the free<BR>
where immigrant workers are being hounded and harassed<BR>
where women and men workers fought back<BR>
the bosses of Rubberstampede in Oakland<BR>
where women and men workers are still fighting back<BR>
on the Lafayette Hotel picket lines<BR>
celebrating workers' militancy for union wages<BR>
paid health and childcare<BR>
bright lights and lounges<BR>
where women and men workers are still fighting back<BR>
today at the California Pacific Medical Center<BR>
the Visiting Nurses and Hospice Workers<BR>
protesting management's anti-union tactics<BR>
in the bright sun while hamburgers sizzle<BR>
on the grill and workers, black, white,<BR>
yellow, brown, gay and straight,<BR>
young and old, declare their unity<BR>
to beat back the bosses who scare them<BR>
not one whit<BR>
<BR>
<P>We hold hands across the waters<BR>
you grace our land<BR>
as you've stood up tall<BR>
against Mersey Docks & Harbour Company<BR>
You've demonstrated, you've visited scab houses,<BR>
Directors' houses, the Christmas party<BR>
just anything you can do to gain<BR>
attention and publicity<BR>
You've written all the shareholders<BR>
explained what was going on<BR>
and asked them to take it up at meetings.<BR>
<BR>
<P>You, the wonderful Women on the Waterfront<BR>
are very important to the men<BR>
You've boosted their morale<BR>
You've shown your militancy,<BR>
your guts, your strong and mighty voices<BR>
<BR>
<P>You stood proud as you closed the gates<BR>
on your own, you meet once a week,<BR>
between 50 and a 100 sisters<BR>
You don't sit home, you get involved<BR>
You discover your strengths<BR>
as you walk the line<BR>
as you talk to each other<BR>
as you teach how strikes can be won<BR>
<BR>
<P>Now you are here<BR>
in these United States<BR>
You show us what it means<BR>
to fight back<BR>
You shut down dock gates<BR>
in half a foot of snow<BR>
and never thought two years ago<BR>
that your bodies would be<BR>
on the front lines<BR>
<BR>
<P>Mersey Docks & Harbour Company,<BR>
take warning, you are dealing with<BR>
the Women on the Waterfront<BR>
you are dealing with women<BR>
who organize with flair and love<BR>
who halt their social lives<BR>
who rise before the sun<BR>
and work 'til twilight and beyond<BR>
who protect their families<BR>
infusing in the men and children<BR>
just how mighty<BR>
Women on the Waterfront are<BR>
fighting for jobs that belong<BR>
to the workers, building,<BR>
illuminating the workingclass movement<BR>
across the waters<BR>
<BR>
<P>Now when I hear clanging of a gate shutting<BR>
now when I see a half foot of snow<BR>
I see you, the Women on the Waterfront<BR>
holding placards up high<BR>
as you circle the docks<BR>
as you make a stand for justice<BR>
and give meaning to<BR>
An Injury to One is An Injury to All<BR>
as you shout from the top of your lungs<BR>
letting the bosses know that the fury<BR>
of women will be heard across the waters<BR>
all across this earth, your fists clenched<BR>
for the battles you so valiantly take on<BR>
<BR>
<P>Keep on, Women on the Waterfront,<BR>
clang those gates shut<BR>
open up the battlefield<BR>
where your sunlit faces radiate<BR>
where one fine day<BR>
women and men workers<BR>
will run this world<BR>
