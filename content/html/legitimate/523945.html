        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/freaks.gif" width="90" height="159" align="left" alt="Freaks - 1932" />Other 
          classic horror films of the 1930s and early 1940s included one of the best 
          adventure/horror films of all time - it was the &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; classic <a href="kingk.html">  <b>King Kong (1933)</b></a>. Special effects expert Willis O'Brien created 
          many of the models for the film. After his success with <a href="drac.html"><b>Dracula 
            (1931)</b></a>, Tod Browning directed the unusual, gothic <b><a href="freaks.html">Freaks (1932)</a></b> with real-life side-show &quot;freaks&quot; - one of his best works. It told how a group 
          of freaks took revenge on a beautiful gold-digging trapeze artist and turned 
          her into a monstrous half-human, half-bird. This cult film redefined the concepts 
          of beauty, love, and abnormality, but was so disturbingly ahead of its time 
          that audiences stayed away in huge numbers, and it was even banned for 30 
          years in England. After this film, Browning's career would never be the same 
          - he directed only a few more films through 1939 before retiring.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">British director James Whale directed the spooky, dark comedy/ghost 
          story <b>The Old Dark House (1932)</b> with Karloff in the ensemble cast (in 
          his first starring role) as Morgan the butler and female lead Gloria Stuart 
          (later revived by <b>Titanic (1997)</b>). Charles Laughton was H. G. Wells' 
          crazed scientist Dr. Moreau (from the 1896 novel) in <b>The Island of Lost Souls 
            (1932)</b> (banned in Britain until 1958, and re-made in 1977 with Burt Lancaster and 1996 as <b>The Island 
              of Dr. Moreau</b> with Marlon Brando), responsible for turning innocent animals 
          into grotesque hybrid-humans.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">When Karloff refused the title role, Claude Rains starred 
          as <b>The Invisible Man (1933)</b> in James Whale's second hit and Universal's 
          critically-acclaimed film version of H. G. Wells' novel. [When the title character 
          stripped naked in one scene to avoid the police, the trail of footprints in 
          the snow revealed a pair of feet wearing shoes!] Laughton took the role of 
          the horribly deformed bellringer who saves Esmeralda (Maureen O'Hara) in the 
          excellent <b>The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)</b>. Claude Rains appeared 
          in the semi-musical remake of <b>Phantom of the Opera (1943)</b> as disfigured 
          composer Erik. In the post-war years, George Sanders starred in classic adaptation 
          of Oscar Wilde's novel <b>The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945)</b> about a man 
          (Hurd Hatfield) whose portrait showed physical aging while he remained youthful.</font></p>
        <p> <font size="2"><b><em>The Mummy</em> Films:</b> </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/mummy.jpg" width="105" height="189" align="right" alt="The Mummy - 1932" />One of the earliest 'mummy' films was <strong>The Vengeance of Egypt (1912, Fr.)</strong> -- with a terrifying mummy seeking revenge for its stolen ring. Notable films with living (or walking) dead, &quot;zombie&quot; plots 
          included Universal's and first-time director Karl Freund's classic <b>The 
            Mummy (1932)</b> with Boris Karloff in the title role as the 3,700 year-old 
          bandaged corpse of Im-ho-tep - it was Karloff's second Monster role success. 
          Trading on Karloff's success in both <i>The Mummy</i> and <i>Frankenstein</i>, 
          the British film <b>The Ghoul (1933)</b> starred Karloff as an Egyptologist 
          who sought eternal life by being buried with a rare jewel. Four Universal sequels to the original 1932 film were: </font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2"><strong>The Mummy's Hand (1940)</strong> - d. William Christy Cabanne; Universal's sequel to their original <em>The Mummy</em> film, with Tom Tyler as the reborn mummy Kharis (his only appearance as The Mummy)</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Mummy's Tomb (1942)</b> -  d. Harold Young; in this and the next two Universal films, Lon Chaney, Jr. starred in the title role as Kharis; this was a direct sequel to <em>The Mummy's Hand (1940)</em> </font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Mummy's Ghost (1944)</b> - d. Reginald Le Borg </font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Mummy's Curse (1944)</b> - d. Leslie Goodwins; the setting was Louisiana Cajun country; this was the last appearance of Lon Chaney, Jr. as The Mummy </font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><font size="2">Horror Films in Color:</font></strong></p>
        <p><font size="2">The first horror film to be shot in two-strip Technicolor was director Michael Curtiz' mad scientist who-dun-it film <strong>Doctor X (1932)</strong>, with Lionel Atwill starring as Doctor Xavier. The very similar <strong>Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933)</strong> also with Atwill as deranged wax museum exhibitor Igor, was also shot in an early Technicolor process, and distributed on a wider scale.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="2"><em>Dracula</em> Sequels at Mid-Century:</font></b> </p>
        <p><font size="2">Although more plentiful, <i>Dracula</i> films and sequels
            were  less successful than many of the superb <i>Frankenstein</i> sequels.
            To capitalize  on its earlier successes, Universal Studios (and other
            studios) slowly churned out  more <i>Dracula</i> sagas in the 30s
            and 40s, but only <u>two</u> featured Bela Lugosi as the character of Dracula
            (he was in the original 1931 Universal film, and then only in one
            other - the comedy hybrid <strong>Abbott
            and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)</strong>). Viewers normally
            thought that Lugosi portrayed the character of Dracula in many  
            films, but he only starred in two as the actual Dracula. However,
            he had some similar roles, first in Tod Browning's and MGM's <b>Mark
            of the Vampire (1935)</b>,
            Bela Lugosi played Count Mora (an actor pretending to be a vampire)
            and  Carol Borland starred as his ghoulish-looking daughter Luna.
            And then in Lew Landers' <strong>The Return of the Vampire (1943)</strong>,
            Lugosi portrayed a reawakened vampire (very similar in appearance
            to Count Dracula) named Armand Tesla. And finally, Lugosi appeared
            in the comedy-horror film <b>Mother Riley Meets the Vampire (1952,
            UK)</b>        as a vampire-type character named Von Housen.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">T</font><font size="2">he <em>first</em> official and
            direct <i>Dracula</i> sequel with hints of lesbianism - <b>Dracula's
            Daughter (1936)</b>, starred Gloria Holden as Countess Marya Zaleska
            who arrived in London to claim her father's body and developed a
            taste for blood - mostly from female victims. It would take another
            seven years for the next <em>Dracula</em> sequel,  Robert Siodmak's <b>Son
             of Dracula (1943)</b> set 
          in the American South. Lon Chaney, Jr. starred in the title role as
            the vampire (posing as Hungarian Count Alucard). For some reason,
             Universal did not crank up the number <em>Dracula</em> films,
            and instead placed the Dracula character mostly in a number of monster
            hybrid films in its next three films: <b>House of Frankenstein (1944),
            House of Dracula (1945), </b>and<b> Abbott and Costello
            Meet  Frankenstein (1948)</b>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> Increasingly regarded as a campy horror character, Bela Lugosi (who had sunk into poverty by the 1940s after showing a reluctance to be typecast as Dracula) appeared in 
          a financially-successful horror-comedy parody, <b>Abbott and Costello Meet 
            Frankenstein (1948)</b> as Dracula, and then after struggling with drug addiction, 
          stooped to work with cult director Ed Wood on <b>Glen or Glenda? (1953)</b> and <b>Bride of the Monster (1955)</b>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><em>Frankenstein</em> Sequels and Other Horror-Star Hybrids at Mid-Century:</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/bridef.gif" width="90" height="159" align="right" alt="The Bride of Frankenstein - 1935" />The 
          witty <em>Frankenstein</em> sequel directed by James Whale titled <a href="bride.html">  <b>Bride of Frankenstein (1935)</b></a> outdid the original - it was a marvelous 
          mixture of campy (and sophisticated) black humor, classic terror, and unforgettable 
          images - including Elsa Lanchester (actor Charles Laughton's wife) in two 
          roles: as the spectacular bride with a Nefertiti hairdo, and as <i>Frankenstein</i> author Mary Shelley. The best played-role was by Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, 
          with its most memorable scene being the first sighting of the Monster by the 
          Bride - with her accompanying shriek of terror. The continuing series of <em>Frankenstein</em> films included:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2">the exploitative <b>Son of Frankenstein (1939)</b> - the third film of the <em>Frankenstein</em> series,  Karloff's last film as Frankenstein's Monster (it co-starred 
            Bela Lugosi as Ygor and Basil Rathbone as Baron von Frankenstein); it was one of 
            the best sequels before many inferior creations in the 1940s and 50s</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942)</b> starring Lon Chaney Jr. as the 
            Monster (it was the first film without Karloff as the Monster)</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman (1943)</b> - the fifth film 
            in the <i>Frankenstein</i> series</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2">Together, Lugosi and Karloff also starred in three films together, 
          the best being their first film - Edgar Ulmer's <a href="blac.html"><b>The 
            Black Cat (1934)</b></a> (based on an Edgar Allen Poe story). The two actors 
          represented characters with antagonistic bad blood between them: Lugosi as 
          ex-war prisoner Dr. Vitus Werdegast, and Karloff as a Satanic architect named 
          Poelzig. Karloff and Lugosi followed their success by 
            being paired in <b>The Raven (1935)</b>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Additional campy 
          entries included AIP's <b>I Was a Teenage Frankenstein (1957) </b>and <b>I
          Was a  Teenage Werewolf (1957)</b> - the latter was  one of the best
          'teenage' monster films with future star Michael Landon as the juvenile
          delinquent werewolf monster. </font></p>
        <p> <font size="2"> <strong>Zombie Films in the 1930s - 1940s:</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Zombies are 'walking dead' creatures, often with decayed flesh, that are destructive, 
          malevolent, prey on human flesh, and almost impossible to 'kill.' The word <i>zombie</i> was derived from the Bantu language of Angola (n-zumbi meaning 
          ghost or departed spirit), and zombies (involved in Haitian voodoo) debuted 
        in William B. Seabrook's sensational book about Haitian voodoo titled <i>The Magic Island</i>. The lurid book detailed his adventures and  encounters with the 'living dead' &ndash; shambling hulks with unfocused staring eyes  and expressionless faces.  It could be argued 
          that the 'somnambulism' in the German expressionist film <b>The Cabinet of 
            Dr. Caligari (1920, Germ.)</b> was one of the earliest examples of a hypnotic, sleep-walking 
          state similar to that exhibited by zombies.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In the  early 1930s, Hollywood (Universal Studios, in particular) was beginning to  experiment with iconic monster films, and it was only a matter of time before  the first feature-length 'walking dead' film appeared. The first 'true' zombie film was director 
          Victor Halperin's and UA's low-budget independent film - the  atmospheric <b>White Zombie (1932)</b>, 
          with <a href="drac.html"><b>Dracula (1931)</b></a> star Bela Lugosi as 'Murder' 
          Legendre - an evil voodoo master, necromancer and sinister hypnotist. He ran a Haitian 
          sugar mill with empty-faced, mindless zombie slaves and entered into a perverse 
          pact to control and win the soul of a bride-to-be (Madge Bellamy). It was deliberately made with minimal dialogue, and filmed to be visually atmospheric and expressionistic. The inspiration for the film was the short-lived  1932 Broadway play titled <em>Zombie</em> by  Kenneth Webb. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> <img src="covers/kingofzombies.jpg" width="94" height="149" align="right" alt="King of the Zombies - 1941" />Its sequel 
          or 'continuation' film was the inferior <b>Revolt of the Zombies (1936)</b>, with another 
          preposterous plot, poor acting (from Dean Jagger as a Cambodian sorcerer-priest with a secret  formula to create zombies), and ineffective direction. 
          The talkative and slow-moving film was  overshadowed by a lawsuit about its use of the word 'zombie.' In the hour-long horror thriller <strong>Ouanga (1936) (aka The Love Wanga, or Drums of the Jungle)</strong><em>,</em> native Haitian  plantation owner (and voodoo priestess) Clelie (Fredi Washington) jealously raised  two zombies to vengefully kidnap her ex-lover Adam's  new white fianc&eacute;e named Eve, and sacrifice her in a ceremony.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">During the 1940s, there were three zombie films from 'Poverty Row's' Monogram Studios, some of which tied Nazism to zombie-lore: the pre-war <b>King of the Zombies (1941)</b>  told of a crash-landing on a remote Caribbean island with 
          a suspicious and sinister Nazi-like spy/doctor named Miklos Sangre (Henry Victor) who conducted hypnotic voodoo rituals in his underground  dungeon and was ready to release a horde of zombies. In its B-film sequel, director Steve Sekely's <b>Revenge 
            of the Zombies (1943) (aka The Corpse Vanished)</b>, John Carradine starred 
          as a Nazi scientist building a world-dominating zombie army (&quot;living dead&quot; warriors for the Nazi's  Third Reich) in a Louisiana swamp. This 1943 
          film was Academy Award-nominated for Best Scoring for a Dramatic Film! [Both 
          films featured African-American character actor Mantan Moreland in a stereotypical 
          role as a bug-eyed manservant - for comic relief.] The third film was <strong>Voodoo Man (1944)</strong><em>,</em> a recycled <em>Revenge of the Zombies (1943)</em> which  brought back Bela Lugosi as practicing voodoo master Dr. Marlowe, and John Carradine  as a retarded manservant. Marlowe  kidnapped young women to use their will and  spirit to animate his dead wife. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/walkzombie.jpg" width="95" height="149" align="right" alt="I Walked With a Zombie - 1943" />One 
          of the better zombie films of the 40s was RKO director Jacques Tourneur's 
          (and producer Val Lewton's) atmospheric, intelligent and spooky B-film masterpiece <b>I Walked 
            With A Zombie (1943)</b>, a West Indies  derivation of Charlotte Bronte's classic dark romance <em>Jane Eyre.</em>  The movie's most atmospheric scene was the  dream-like nocturnal walk through the sugar-cane plantation fields to a native  voodoo ceremony with the sound of drums, and the startling appearance of giant,  bug-eyed zombie guard Carre-Four (Darby Jones). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The zombie sub-genre declined after the mid-40s, although
            there were a few notable entries in the 50s, such as Republic's 12-part
            sci-fi serial <strong>Zombies  of the Stratosphere (1952)</strong><em>,</em> producer
            Sam Katzman's <strong>The  Zombies of Mora Tau (1957)</strong> with
            a zombified crew of sailors protecting a sunken treasure vessel,
            AIP's <strong>Voodoo Woman (1957)</strong><em>, </em>and the box-office
            bomb<strong> Teenage
        Zombies (1960)</strong>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Britain's Hammer Studios: The <i>Dracula</i> Cycle</b></font> </p>
        <p><font size="2">The UK's Hammer Studios, as they did with <i>Frankenstein</i> (see below) and <i>Mummy</i> sequels in the 50s, reinvigorated the Bram Stoker <i>Dracula</i> novel in a collection of low-budget films by employing garish, 
          sensual colors and bloody reds - and more overt, suggestive sexuality and graphic violence. The 
          British production company remained faithful to the genre's material (the 
          classics from Universal Studios) in tightly-produced, spectacular Technicolor 
          sequels featuring a seductive, alluring and virile vampire. Talented director 
          Terence Fisher (with Christopher Lee in one of his best appearances as the 
          reclusive Count Dracula and Peter Cushing in a cat-and-mouse game as arch 
          nemesis vampire hunter Dr. Van Helsing) created the classic  <strong>Horror of 
            Dracula (1958, UK) (aka Dracula)</strong> - the <i>first</i> of the Hammer horror films about Dracula. 
          Following its success, Hammer Studios produced more <i>Dracula</i> films with 
          the same characters until the mid-70s (a total of nine films from 1958 to 1974). [Note: Christopher Lee eventually played Dracula in seven of the nine of Hammer's <em>Dracula</em> films from 1958 to 1973]:</font></p>

          <li><font size="2"><b>Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966)</b>, the <em>third</em> Hammer film, the first <em>official</em> sequel to 
            the original Hammer film, with Christopher Lee reprising his role as the 
            caped vampire and Andrew Keir as the vampire hunter</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>Dracula Has Risen From the Grave (1968)</b>, the <em>fourth</em> Hammer film, Christopher

        <p><font size="2"><strong>Lesbian Vampire Films: A Sub-Genre </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It could easily be argued that the first lesbian vampire film was Universal's <b>Dracula's Daughter 
            (1936)</b>, discussed earlier. For commercial reasons, adult-oriented vampire films were produced by Hammer Studios  to spice up 
          the original horror concept with lesbian themes, sex, and nudity. These films were often viewed at America's drive-in theatres in the 70s. The first openly lesbian vampire film was Roger Vadim's <strong>Blood and Roses (1961)</strong>, loosely based on  the 1872 lesbian vampire short story <em>Carmilla</em> by J. Sheridan Le Fanu.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/vampirelovers.jpg" width="105" height="190" alt="The Vampire Lovers - 1970" align="right" />A so-called trilogy of explicit lesbian films (the Karnstein Trilogy) was then introduced in the early 70s by Hammer, all loosely-based on Sheridan Le Fanu's <em>Camilla</em>, with an emphasis on the sexual element:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Vampire 
            Lovers (1970, UK) </b> (a remake of Vadim's film) starring Ingrid Pitt as a sexy, erotic and lesbian vampire  (&quot;Beautiful temptress...or Bloodthirsty monster?&quot;) who corrupted innocent teenaged daughter Emma Morton (Madeline Smith), chasing after her semi-naked in her  bedroom. [Note: Ingrid Pitt proved such a success in the Hammer film that she was immediately given the   title role in <strong>Countess Dracula (1971)</strong> the following year, a toned-down film (not technically a vampire film) based on the legendary   story of Elizabeth (Erzsebet) Bathory.]</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>Lust for a Vampire (1971, UK)</b> -   the publicity still for this erotic sequel, a masturbatory, Sapphic-tinged gothic fantasy-horror 
            film, was an exaggerated, graphic image of  lesbian vampiress 
            Carmilla 'Mircalla' Karnstein (Danish blonde model Yutte Stensgaard) after 
            satisfying her bloodlust and exhibiting a blood-drenched chest in an elite 
          girl's academy. The horror film included 
            a topless massage (between Carmilla and Susan Pelley (Pippa Steel)) leading 
            to a midnight skinny-dip and kiss, a toothsome bloody neck kiss and girl-on-girl 
            action with Amanda (Judy Matheson), and other bloody neck-bitings of the 
          nubile undead female vampires at the exclusive European finishing school for girls.</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><strong>Twins of Evil (1971, UK)</strong>, this erotic Hammer Studio's Dracula 
        film (with plentiful nudity and gore, but without the lesbian plot angle) was the final installment of the 
        Karnstein trilogy. It was set in 17th century Austria and starred 
        Peter Cushing as puritanical, wench-burning Brotherhood witch-hunter Gustav Weil. It also featured October 1970's <i>Playboy</i> Playmate twin centerfolds Mary and 
        Madeleine Collinson as pretty blonde orphaned twins Maria and Frieda Gellhorn - buxom sisters (one virtuous and one carnal) who went to live with their oppressive and tyrannical Uncle Gustav. In the film's plot, local nobleman/vampire and black magic practitioner 
        Count Karnstein (Damien Thomas) seduced the amoral, sensual and lustful Frieda 
        who was reborn as a vampire.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="2"> The Belgian lesbian-vampire film <strong>Daughters of Darkness (1971, Belg.) (aka La Rouge Aux Levres, Blood on the Lips)</strong> was a highly-stylized, erotic, art-house  work by director Henry Kumel and based upon <em>Camilla</em> as well. It starred Delphine Seyrig as the mysterious and beautiful, sultry and elegant Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who was accompanied by her sensual, lesbian Dutch-bob-haired secretary Ilona Harxzy (Andrea Rau). The Countess was intent on seducing a newlywed bride named Valerie (Danielle Oiumet) and vampirizing her, while the newlywed groom Stefan (John Karlen) was being sexually tempted by Ilona. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Even more explicit was the soft-core and bloody <strong>Vampyres (1974, UK) (aka Vampyres: Daughters of Darkness, or Daughters of Dracula)</strong> -
            this film's tagline clearly explained its ultimate appeal: &quot;They shared the pleasures of the flesh, and the horrors of the grave!&quot;, capitalizing on the parallel connection between vampirism and sex, and eroticism and gore. Spanish director Jos&eacute; Ram&oacute;n Larraz's film told about a pair of gorgeous lesbian-bisexual, blood-lusting vampires, brunette Fran (nude model Marianne Morris) and blonde Miriam (ex-<i>Playboy</i> Miss
            May 1973 centerfold Anulka Dziubinska), who took unsuspecting passers-by
            on a foggy country road to their gothic castle at night, where they
            were fed, offered carnal sex, and then they killed their victims
            with knives in order to suck their blood.</font></p>
        <p> <font size="2">Revisionist variations of the vampire character have
            been striking and dramatic (see later more detailed descriptions
            in this article). In the 80s, the most talked-about
            vampire film was director Tony Scott's artsy <b>The
            Hunger (1983)</b> -
          the modern, visually-striking, &quot;new-wave&quot; sci-fi/horror film
          starred seductive Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon in soft-focus
          lesbian encounters. A wide variety of vampire tales were put on celluloid
          in the eighties and afterward, usually with more overtly sexual overtones
        and bloody violence. There have been:</font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/catpeople.gif" width="77" height="140" align="right" alt="Cat People - 1942" />Russian-born 
          Val Lewton, using a more subtle, suggestive, eerie approach in a number of 
          atmospheric, sophisticated horror/suspense films, produced eleven low-budget 
          films for RKO Studios in the 1940s, directed first by Jacques Tourneur, and 
          then by Mark Robson and Robert Wise. Lewton's first psychological horror film, 
          directed by Tourneur in his feature-film debut, was the suspenseful horror 
          classic <a href="catp.html"><b>The Cat People (1942)</b></a> - possibly the 
          first horror film to never show its monster. [A secondary reason for keeping 
          the horror undefined was due to the lack of budget for special effects.] Its 
          heroine Irena (Simone Simon), suffering from an ancient Balkan curse and sado-sexual 
          yearnings, threatens to turn into a panther (the female version of the Wolf 
          Man) if her passionate sexual feelings are aroused. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Through 1948, Tourneur 
          also contributed the definitive voodoo/zombie film <b>I Walked With
          a Zombie  (1943)</b> about re-awakened dead bodies in Haiti, and the
          mystery/horror  film <b>The
          Leopard Man (1943) </b>about a deadly black leopard (and a serial killer!).
          Years later, Tourneur returned only once to the horror genre with his
          fourth true horror film <b>Curse of the Demon 
            (1957)</b> <b>(aka Night of the Demon)</b>, a film which demonstrated
            Lewton's  influence. [Tourneur was most famous for the <i>film noir</i> classic, <a href="outo.html">  <b>Out
            of the Past (1947)</b></a>.]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> Under Lewton's production, Mark Robson directed the
            pre-<i>Rosemary's 
          Baby, </i> noirish<i> </i>classic film of Satanic worship and death
          called <b>The
          Seventh  Victim (1943)</b>, <b>Isle of the Dead (1945)</b> with Karloff
          in a starring  role, and <b>Bedlam (1945)</b>. The most influential
          of Lewton's directors  was Robert Wise, who created such classics as <b>The
          Curse of the Cat People  (1944)</b> and <b>The Body Snatcher (1945)</b> with
          Boris Karloff as a sinister,  wily grave-robbing cabman. Later in his
          career, Wise also directed the superior  ghost story <b>The Haunting
          (1963)</b> based on Shirley Jackson's classic 
          novel <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> - it remains one of the greatest
          of  all haunted house films.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2"> [A film with a similar haunted house theme
            was William Castle's <b> House on Haunted Hill (1958)</b>, in which
            an eccentric millionaire (Vincent Price) and his 4th wife Annabelle
            invited five people to their house on Haunted Hill for a house party.
            Anyone who survived the 12-hour night in the locked house (after midnight)
            would receive $10,000. It was elaborately remade in 1999. Another 'haunted

            a memorable ventriloquist dummy; one of the best love/ghost-supernatural
            films ever made <b>The Uninvited 
            (1944)</b>, with Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey in an old house on the
            English coast; and director Jack Clayton's classic <b>The Innocents (1961)</b>,
            adapted from Henry James' novel <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>, with
            Deborah Kerr as an English governess for an orphaned boy and girl
            in a creepy countryside estate. </font> </p>
        <p> <font size="2"><b>The Cycle of 50's Horror Films:</b> </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2">Many of the films in the horror genre from the mid-1930s to 
          the late 1950s were B-grade movies, inferior sequels, or atrocious low-budget 
          gimmick films. In the atomic age of the 1950s, much was made of the modern 
          effects of radioactivity exposure, toxic chemical spills, or other scientific 
          accidents - such as the development of giant mutant monsters or carnivorous 
          insects, including <strong>Gojira (1954, Jp.) (aka Godzilla)</strong>. During 
          that time, most of the monster horror films were cheaply made, drive-in, teenage-oriented, 
          grade-Z films, such as <b>I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957)</b>. There
          was also the creature feature - <b>The Creature From the Black Lagoon
          (1954)</b>. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/invasion.gif" width="90" height="159" align="right" alt="Invasion of the Body Snatchers - 1956" />A
             few American-made monster/horror films of the time, however, effectively
            capitalized  on terrorizing threats that included extraterrestrial
            powers or space invaders,  such as the space alien found in the Arctic
            ice in <b><a href="thing.html">The Thing (From Another World) 
            (1951)</a></b>, the unusual Gil-man monster in <b>The Creature From
            the Black  Lagoon (1954)</b>, mutant ants in the New Mexico desert
            in <b>Them! (1954)</b>, 
          or the aberrant or alien threat in Don Siegel's classic tale of Cold
            War paranoia  - <a href="inva.html"><b>Invasion of the Body Snatchers
            (1956)</b></a>. The 
          latter film, a tale cautioning against conformity, was a classic tale
            of zombie-like  clones taking over the bodies of the residents of
            a small California town.  [A remake by Philip Kaufman, <b>Invasion
            of the Body Snatchers (1978)</b>, 
          set in San Francisco, featured a cameo appearance by the first film's
            star  Kevin McCarthy.] </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2">Director Jack Arnold's allegorical <b>The Incredible
              Shrinking  Man (1957)</b>, from a screenplay by author Richard
              Matheson, showed the deadly  mutations and after-effects of exposure
              to radioactivity - even a cat or a  spider could become a frightening
              monster to a shrunken human. To counter  the popularity of TV,
              film studios experimented with 3-D in films such as <b>House of
              Wax (1953)</b> (the hit film, and Warners' first 3-D color film
              - with a stereo soundtrack - that launched the career of Vincent
              Price as &quot;the
              King of Horror&quot; in
              the role of sculptor Professor Henry Jarrod who vengefully turned
              the corpses of his enemies into wax figures). It was a remake of <b>Mystery
              of the Wax Museum (1933)</b>, and was remade again almost half
              a century later: <b>House of Wax (2005)</b> with Paris Hilton!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Two other late 50s films with sci-fi/horror features included: <b>The Blob (1958)</b> and the original <b>The Fly (1958)</b> (with Vincent 
          Price as the brother of a scientist who accidentally was turned into a part 
          house-fly). The latter film spawned many sequels in later generations (its 
          two sequels: <b>Return of the Fly (1959)</b> and <b>Curse of the Fly (1965)</b>; 
          and another remake <b>The Fly (1986)</b> with its own sequel <b>The Fly 2 
            (1989)</b>). Charles Laughton's only directorial effort was for <a href="nightof.html">  <b>The Night of the Hunter (1955)</b></a> about a homicidal yet charismatic 
          preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) with 'love' and 'hate' tattooed on 
          his hands. </font> </p>
        <p> <font size="2"><b>Roger Corman's Films:</b> </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/littleshop.jpg" width="110" height="157" align="right" />Producer/director 
          Roger Corman, known for his low-budget, 'exploitation' films, helped to keep 
          the horror genre alive when the larger Hollywood studios turned away. He created 
          the low-budget, horror lampoon-satire <b>A Bucket of Blood (1959)</b>, a pre-<i>Little 
            Shop of Horrors</i>. It starred  regular Corman  character actor Dick Miller as Walter Paisley - a talentless, mentally-unstable beatnik coffee house bus-boy who became a famous artist after he started murdering and encasing his victims in clay and passing them off as his sculptures (i.e., &quot;Murdered Man&quot;). In the next year, Corman's quickly-made cheapie cult film <b>The Little Shop of Horrors (1960)</b> about a meat-eating house-plant named 
          Audrey inspired an off-Broadway stage musical with the same title and another 
          film in 1986 directed by Frank Oz. </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2">Other more expensive, lavishly-Techni-colored Corman films 
          followed from American International Pictures (AIP), including eight Gothic 
          Edgar Allan Poe-inspired horror tales (mostly starring a villainous Vincent 
          Price) such as:</font> </p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Fall of the House of Usher (1960)</b></font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Pit and the Pendulum (1961)</b></font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Premature Burial (1962)</b> - Corman's only Poe 
            film <i>without</i> Price</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>Tales of Terror (1962) </b>- a trio of short stories</font></li>
          <li><font size="2">the superb <b>The Raven (1963)</b> (with the first screen 
            teaming of horror giants Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, and Peter Lorre - and Jack Nicholson)</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Haunted Palace (1963)</b></font></li>
          <li><font size="2"> the low-budget <b>The Masque of the Red Death (1964)</b> (re-made in 1989 with Corman as producer); one of the best in the series</font></li>
          <li><font size="2"><b>The Tomb of Ligeia (1964)</b></font> </li>
        </ul>
        <p> <font size="2"><img src="covers/carnivalsouls.jpg" width="100" height="178" align="right" alt="Carnival of Souls - 1962" /><b>Other Horror Films in the 60s:</b> </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2">Horror 
          films branched out in all different directions in the 1960s and after, especially 
          as the Production Code disappeared and film censorship was on the decline. 
          Directors began to frankly portray horror in ordinary circumstances and seemingly-innocent 
          settings. While Roger Corman was producing and directing his cheaply and quickly-made 
          horror films in the early 60s, Hammer Studios in England was making <i>Dracula</i> and <i>Frankenstein</i> sequels (see above). Hammer rounded out their horror 
          sequels with director Terence Fisher's <b>The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll (1960)</b> and <b>The Curse of the Werewolf (1961)</b>. </font> </p>
        <p> <font size="2">A controversial English film by Michael Powell titled <b>Peeping 
          Tom (1960, UK)</b> was met with outrage for its chilling story of a murderous 
          psychopathic photographer. In Harold (Herk) Harvey's cultish, low-budget, 
          expressionistic, dream-like zombie film <b>Carnival of Souls (1962)</b>, a 
          young girl suffered ghoulish and nightmarish experiences in a bizarre land 
          of specters after a near-fatal car accident. More suspenseful, atmospheric 
          horror was displayed in the British film <b>Burn Witch, Burn! (1962)</b> (aka <b>Night of the Eagle</b>), written by horror screenwriters Richard Matheson 
          and Charles Beaumont - an exploration of modern witchcraft. </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2"><img src="covers/drterror.jpg" width="100" height="169" align="right" alt="Dr. Terror's House of Horrors - 1964" />Director 
          Robert Aldrich's modern gothic thriller starred two aging Hollywood actresses 
          (Bette Davis with her tenth Oscar nomination and Joan Crawford) as sisters 
          in <a href="what.html"><b>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)</b></a>. 
          Aldrich and Bette Davis were re-teamed together in the Southern Gothic horror 
          tale <b>Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1965)</b>. Producer Roger Corman promoted 
          young filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola's early film - a low-budget thriller 
          about an axe-murderer titled <b>Dementia 13 (1963)</b>. </font> </p>
        <p><font size="2">The first Amicus portmanteau film and one of the best British 
          horror films of the 60s was <b>Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1964)</b> - 
          an entertaining, five-story anthology with Peter Cushing as Dr. Schreck (meaning 
          horror in German), a mysterious doctor who told fortunes for five passengers 
          on a train in a series of vignettes, and horror genre components including 
      a severed hand, a vampire, a man-eating plant, a voodoo curse, and a werewolf. </font> </p></td>
