Over a decade later, I was struck by both nostalgia and ambition and started to write a new 8-bit Atari emulator from scratch. This is the result.</p> <p> At this point, I've learned a lot more about the Atari and Altirra now emulates more than I ever had or did years ago, but I still work on it periodically. It also serves as a modularity test for the VirtualDub code base, from which Altirra shares some components. If you are struck by nostalgia too or have a desire to do some Atari development, perhaps it might be useful to you, too.</p> <p> <b>Note:</b> Neither the author nor the software on this page is affiliated with Atari, and there is no code or software from Atari included in the downloads.

It's designed as a system emulator and debugger instead of a games machine, so there is some setup involved. There is a README file in the archive, but here are some quick tips:</p> <p> <b>First: Software.</b> you need some actual 8-bit Atari (not Atari ST!) software to run. If you don't have any, it'll be a pretty boring experience. I can't give this to you for various reasons, but there are freely available demos, and if you have converted your Atari software to disk images for other emulators, those will work too. Specifically, disk images are supported in ATR, DCM, ATX, and PRO formats; some simple cartridge types are also supported, and you can directly load Atari executables as well (.obx/.xex).</p> <p> <b>Second: kernel ROMs.</b> Altirra has an internal kernel that can be used to run Atari software, and thus you can run demos, games, and productivity software without needing any Atari ROM images. However, this kernel is reimplemented from scratch, and has some compatibility problems with software that depends on undocumented entry points or behavior. Therefore, you may want to consider hooking up real kernel ROM images, which will greatly increase Altirra's software compatibility. I'm afraid I can't offer these for download, but if you have downloaded ROM images from your Atari, Altirra uses the same format and filenames as most other popular Atari 8-bit system emulators.</p> <p> <b>Third: compatibility.</b> Altirra is designed to emulate the actual Atari hardware as closely as possible. Its compatibility has been increasing over time, and at this point it should run most software correctly. However, there can still be problems, some of which may be emulation bugs, and some of which are related to hardware emulation settings. Tips:</p> <ul> <li>Disable BASIC (unless you're actually running a BASIC program).</li> <li>For older games, use 800 hardware and 48K RAM, and the OS-B kernel.</li> <li>For newer games, use XL hardware and 128K RAM (XE), and use the XL kernel.</li> <li>For demos and games written in Europe, use XL hardware/kernel, 320K RAM, and PAL.</li> <li>If you don't have kernel ROM images, use the built-in AltirraOS kernel instead.</li> <li>Use Input &gt; Joystick to toggle the joystick, which uses the arrow keys and the left control key.</li></ul> <h3>System requirements</h3> <p> Altirra has relatively few system requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 or later, either 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64 or ARM64). (Windows RT not supported)</li> <li>Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon 64 CPU or better (SSE2 required), or Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or newer (ARM64 version).</li> <li>Graphics card supporting DirectX 9.0 with pixel shader 2.0 or later support recommended, but not required.</li></ul> <p> Still running Windows XP or Vista? Altirra 3.91 is the last version that will run on versions of Windows older than Windows 7.</p> <p> Do you have a CPU that doesn't support SSE2? Altirra 2.90 is the last version that will run on non-SSE2 capable CPUs.</p> <h3>Downloads</h3> <p> Altirra is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2.</p> <p> Binaries, i.e. stuff you can run (all local downloads):</p> <blockquote> <p> Starting with 3.10, both x86/x64 and ARM64 versions are provided.

   * Devices: Fixed bug where debug reads from SIDE/SIDE2 flash windows could trigger side effects during sector erase operations.
   * Devices: Rapidus fast RAM windows no longer have priority over ROM.
   * Devices: Fixed Rapidus main RAM speed override sometimes being reverted; main RAM is now always at slow speed and extended RAM is also slow speed.
   * Devices: Fixed R-Time 8 state being changed by debug reads in the debugger.
   * Disk: Fixed name mangling on virtual SDFS disks for files and directories with names starting with periods.
   * Disk: Fixed corrupted double-density ATRs being written in some cases from full disk drive emulators.
   * Disk: Fixed bug with final write from full drive emulators not always triggering auto-flush.
   * Disk: Fixed corruption of first byte sent by 810/1050 full drive emulators.
   * Disk: Recalibrated ACK-to-Complete delays for the standard disk emulator for Status and Read PERCOM Block commands based on firmware timings.
   * Disk: Virtual SDFS volumes now use creation timestamps for directories.
   * Disk: Added workaround for 1050 Turbo firmware not detecting density if the drive is powered up with a disk already inserted.
   * Disk: Fixed hang when loading ATX images with extra data pointing to out-of-range sectors.
   * Disk: Fixed XF551 formatting side 2 of disks with incorrect interleave.
   * Disk: Motor off timer adjusted for 1050 timing and to not count down during disk operations.
   * Disk: Accurate sector timing mode now waits for the full length of long sectors in 1050-based emulation modes.
   * Disk: Fixed broken audio output from Indus GT disk drives.
   * Disk: Generic disk emulation profile supports XF551 acceleration again.
   * Disk: Fixed several broken/missing instructions in Z80 emulation.
   * Display: Fixed chroma signal having reversed phase in NTSC high artifacting mode, causing chroma artifacts in mono mode to move in the wrong direction.
   * Display: D3D9 driver now allocates swap chain immediately to force a fallback with useless D3D drivers that report PS3.0 but only have 1MB of VRAM.
   * Display: Fixed intensity scale color setting not affecting saturation in NTSC high artifacting mode.
   * Display: Fixed issues in the high artifacting chroma filters causing some excessive banding.
   * HDevice: Fixed burst writes not returning error status correctly.
   * HLE: CRITIC is no longer zeroed from PBI-based SIO acceleration to fix key repeat issues with some versions of SpartaDOS X.
   * IDE: Fixed Rev. S not supporting some Rev. D registers and being detected as Rev. C.
   * Input: Fixed arrow keys getting stuck down in emulation when pressing Alt+arrow and then releasing Alt first, with arrow keys bound to a controller.
   * Input: Quick maps are now always cycled in sorted name order.
   * Input: Fixed controller triggers getting stuck down in some cases when detaching light gun controllers.
   * Input: Fixed flipped horizontal relative movements for tablets.
   * Input: Trigger targets are now collapsed properly so that multiple mappings to the same target cooperate, e.g. Left -> Numpad7, Up -> Numpad7, Up -> Numpad8, with both keys being pressed and released in any order.
   * Input: Direct keyboard layout had incorrect mappings for Ctrl/Shift+Space.
   * PCLink: Fixed reversed directory sort order.
   * PCLink: Now uses last write timestamp for files instead of creation timestamp.
   * PerfAnalyzer: Fixed painting bug with ANTIC DL event channel at some zoom levels and scroll positions.
   * PerfAnalyzer: Fixed timing error for bytes sent to the computer from a full disk drive emulator, which were shown starting at their actual end times.
   * POKEY: Channel mixing updated to use more representative per-channel non-linear steps.
   * POKEY: Fixed channels occasionally having their timing disrupted when toggling timer IRQs.
   * POKEY: Fixed extra audio pulse when timer 1/2 underflow coincides with two-tone timer reset.
   * POKEY: Fixed keys not being re-reported in raw non-full scan mode when enabling debounce with keyboard scan already enabled.
   * UI: Fixed mouse wheel scrolling when the system wheel scroll setting is set to pages instead of lines.
   * UI: Profile editor no longer allows parenting a profile to itself or its children.
   * UI: Settings load/save code now detects profile loops due to the profile editor bug and forces a reparent to the global profile so settings saving still works.
   * UI: ARM64 emulation dialog no longer allows saving "OK" response.
   * UI: Added 5 second timeout when notifying an existing instance in single instance mode to prevent processes piling up if the instance is hung.
   * UI: Full-screen file browser scrolls back to top when changing folders.
   * VBXE: Improved GTIA state syncing when toggling VBXE on the fly.
   * XEP80: Scrolling now always removes one physical line, not a logical line as E: does.
   * XEP80: Fixed an occasional issue with indeterminate state after cold reset.
   * XEP80: Printing a char at the right margin now only inserts a line when EOL is overwritten.
   * XEP80: Delete line can now slice a multi-line logical line like the real XEP80 does.
   * XEP80: Fill EOL ($1C6) command was using the wrong fill byte.
