<TR><TD class="yea">early years</TD>
<TD class="inf"><SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> The <B>first time I ever rode a bicycle</B> was on a Schwinn 16-inch bike. I don't know what the name of it was. We lived on a slight bill, and my mom set me up on the bike to get me going. It didn't have training wheels; I guess she just wanted me to go for it on the first try. I hopped on, and she set me up, pushed me a little and I was cruising, it seemed so easy. I was all stoked. I headed down right away. I went about two houses. I guess I got overconfident or something and swerved and hit a bush and flipped over the bars. I totally dumped it and was kind of scared the next time I got on it. But I got back up, and by the next day I was riding doubles with a dude that lived behind me. We were cruisin' down and bailed into another tree. It was hard-core.<BR>
<BR>
</SPAN><SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> I was riding for years on my <B>K-Mart bike,</B> before I started BMX racing, jumping curbs and riding wheelies up the street. We'd put a cinder block down with a board and get hauling down the street and have <B>distance contests</B> and stuff. We'd also practice wheelies out on the sidewalk. There was a bump on the sidewalk, and we used to hit that and pull up the wheelie. I still remember the day I beat my big brother's record. That's when he got out of bikes. I'm serious! He'd always rub it in my face. Try and play it off like: &quot;My little brother, who's better than me, and I was the lamest in the family&quot; or whatever. I kept practicing, and one day<B> I just blew his wheelie record out</B>. Within a week he never rode his bike again. That ended his career. He could have become a freestyler, too.<BR>
<BR>
</SPAN><SPAN class="qoq">Dennis McCoy, Ride BMX US february 2006:</SPAN> <SPAN class="je">Twelve years old, summer of '79. Some friends and I rode a few miles from home to investigate a rumor about some rival trails in the woods. We ran into several high schoolaged kids on bikes much shinier than ours riding jumps bigger than ours while AC/DC cranked out of their portable stereo. In an effort to fit in, I name-dropped Tim Biondo, an older local who had convinced us he was the man. After they repeated Biondo's name and burst into laughter, a skinny guy with glasses called &quot;Stover&quot; did a huge one-footed table to &quot;TNT&quot; and my life changed forever.<BR>
<BR>
</SPAN>Dennis McCoy started out as a BMX racer. His <B>first race</B> was in 1980 when he rode on a track that used a rubber-band start.<BR>
<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> I got the holesot in my first moto and slid out in the first turn. I got run over by everybody and think some people turned around and ran over me again.<B><BR>
<BR>
</B></SPAN><SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> I remember watching TV, PM Magazine, back in 1980 at Christmas time with a friend of mine, Sean Dixon. We saw some guys riding at a nearby skatepark. They were doing rockwalks and stuff like that. We freaked out and spent the next few days trying to learn some of the tricks we saw on that show. From then on, we freestyled while we raced. We progressed at such a slow rate, but back then it seemed normal. If you learned one trick in a year it was progression.<BR>
<BR>
</SPAN><SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> <B>I got serious about freestyle before I quit racing.</B> I'd say. I had a Potts mod on my bike long before I quit racing. When we first saw the advertisement on locking levers, we couldn't get hold of them yet, so John Hensley and I made our own. So I would say I became serious sometime in '84.<BR>
<BR>
</SPAN><SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> My first freestyle bike was a <B>Haro</B>. I used to freestyle on my race bikes, though -P.K. Ripper- until I got out of racing. That's when I won a Haro in a photo contest; I put it together and have used it ever since. I've always ridden a Haro.<BR>
<BR>
</SPAN><SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> <B>The first ramp I ever rode </B>was one we bought from a guy who built it. He rode bikes and skateboards, and he built a ramp out of some jungle gym. It was a giant jungle gym, and he heated the pipes and bent them. It was seven -and-a-half feet tall with, say, two feet of vert. It had a five-or six foot transition. Back then we didn't really know how to ride vert. So the second we hit vertical, or maybe a little bit before, we'd take off on our aerial and kind of drift to the top. If we could get our back wheel out of the top of the ramp and were actually taking off two or three feet below the top, we'd be getting more air than it looked like, because we weren't using the vertical except to land on. After a while there were designs for ramps in the magazines. Usually for six-foot-tall ramps. but we wanted one eight feet tall. There was a five-foot-tall ramp we rode for a while and some halfpipes in the area that skaters owned. But our first serious ramp was from plans that were in the magazines. They had the old stud pattern using three different boards going up instead of a smooth transition. We enlarged the dimensions to an eightfoot ramp. We went by their plans except for sizing. That was in about '83.</SPAN></TD>

Back in '82 there weren't any bikes made just for freestyle, so Dennis McCoy rode his Hutch race bike on ramps instead. Not too bad for a 15-year-old.

<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis McCoy, Ride BMX US february 2006:</SPAN> <SPAN class="je">In March of 1984, my friend John Hensley was tall and skinny with long hair and a perm that made him resemble an overgrown poodle. He was also a damn good photographer who shot my first photo to run in a magazine. BMXAction held a photo contest and we placed second with this photo of a hip hanger on my Hutch Expert. Ironically, the price was a Haro frameset, and Bob Haro offered me a sponsorship deal before it arrived.</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis McCoy, Ride BMX US february 2006:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> Seventeen years old, march of '84. St. Patrick's Day in Kansas City is a big deal. Typically the televised parade consists of themed floats and marching bands, but somehow my friend's dad managed to get the BMX Brigade approved as a participant. That all changed when 30-plus loudmouth kids showed up in their black and white Brigade shirts looking completely unorganized. Parade officials pulled our permit. A few blocks from the TV cameras we invited ourselves back into the parade and our impromptu flatland session for the viewing audience balled the whole parade up. Motorcycle cops could be seen on screen chasing us off camera. The Brigade grew that day when Brian Belcher and his crew witnessed it all on TV and rode downtown to join our posse.</SPAN><BR>

Dennis graduated from high school third in his class and got a perfect 4.0 average in college his freshman year before leaving to pursue a pro freestyle career.<BR>
<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> It was just a matter of getting most of my work done at school, totally using my time efficiently while at school, instead of slacking off and talking to people. I hurried and tried to get everthing done while I was there. Usually, I wouldn't have any homework, and if I did, I'd do it at the end of the night. School really wasn't that big of a deal. In college it was a little bit different. I had to set aside more time for homework. Usually. there were days when I'd have an early class at nine or ten in the morning and my second class would be at three or four in the afternoon. So I'd go to the library for almost all day to take care of all my homework. I had the rest of the time to ride. I guess it would be the same as having a job and riding, which is what a lot of people do.</SPAN></TD>

Dennis McCoy did a lot of boomerang variations in his runs, also used plenty of his patented footwork and his routine was virtually flawless. <SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> I only touched two times, which is great for a five-minute routine. I messed up on a triple ankle-buster but went back and pulled it off. The other time I hooked my foot in my Gyro cable, so it was beyond my control.</SPAN><BR>


In pro ramp, DMC had all kinds of new variations. Opposite one-hander one-footer, one-footed invert, fakie airbails on the fakie. Moving into the last part of his routine now, he hit the Skyway ramp and whiped off a fully extended cancan, a lookback, a no-footer. Flew out onto the top of the Haro ramp, doing frontwheel hops in a circle and dropped-in backward ! X-up one-footer fully clicked and to finish up his run; a 540 air about two feet out! That was awesome!<BR>

Dennis started with a 180 rollout, went into a smoothie and then into a reverse top gun. When he dropped his feet back down to his front wheel, he went right into some high-speed footwork, then into a backwards wheelie in a circle, into a sweeper, into a side glide, into a G-string (a rolling tail whip while doing a G-turn) and from there into a mega-spin (a bionic rearwheel spinner), into a double boomerang. Do you get the picture? He was insane! That was only the start of his routine. Everything was a-mile-a-minute and interconnected. Before he was done, he also included a Miami hopper, a triple boomerang, a double tail whip, a fire hydrant into a side squeak, an over-andout, and for his grand finale, his own incredible hyperspastic fork spins. He touched cement maybe three or four times in five minutes, which is incredibly little considering the number and difficulty of his tricks. It was going to be a tough routine to beat. McCoy's riding style has changed the face of freestyle.<BR>

McCoy was still recovering from the injuries he received in a bad crash off the Dan'up quarterpipe four days earlier and didn't enter round 2 of AFA Masters in march 1987.<BR>

Dennis McCoy rode his first-ever halfpipe contest with catlike style and high inverts, opposite-side one-handed one-footers, a 360 flyout that almost knocked Dominguez off the deck, X-up one-footers, a front-wheel abubaca (that Dennis says he, not Ron, invented) and a lookback alley oop. He ended his final run with a 540 about four feet out. Unfortunately, he hung up so badly that he caught his chain on the coping! Dennis flailed to a slam at the bottom of the ramp, but he wasn't hurt.<BR>

On ramps, Dennis started out by launching an abubaca from the deck of the quarter, and then a high air, a no-footed fakie, a shortramp Miami hopper, a 360 flyout to 270 drop-in on the quarter, a turndown, a lookdown, an alley oop fakie, a high X-up, a front-wheel 360 on the short ramp, a high fakie cross-up and, after trying to get into it twice, a drop-in from a cherry picker! No way.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2nd place pro flat and 3rd pro vert @ 1987 AFA Masters round 5, Wayne, New Jersey, october 3-4, 1987.</B><BR>
Dennis rode out onto the floor with his trademark high-speed, ultra-difficult routine of incredible tricks, including a triple hang glider and hyper-spastic front.and backyards, linked together with squeakers, fork wheelies, boomerangs and tail whips. Dennis squeezed far more tricks into his run than anybody else in the class but also made too many mistakes, touching the ground six times, three of which included having both feet on the floor at the same time.<BR>

<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis McCoy, Ride BMX US february 2006:</SPAN> <SPAN class="je">20 years old, fall of '87. I've always loved traveling to NYC. My friends and I from KC visited regularly and brought home endless stories for those that didn't make the journey. Rick Thorne's first trip with me was over Halloween in 1987. We would street ride all night and spend the afternoons riding flatland at some basketball courts in the village. The locals would come and go quite a bit and seemed to be pretty fond of Chinese food, One day I overheard Derek from the Bronx say &quot;Yo LB, it's dinner time,&quot; and a few riders rolled around the corner off Houston Street, Rick and I sensed something was up so we followed at a distance and witnessed one of the cruelest and funniest things I've ever seen. Derek was screaming something about a two-block headstart as they sprinted after some poor soul delivering Chinese food on a Pee Wee Herman-style bike. The lead rider snatched the bag of food from the basket and Derek gave the guy's wheel a little nudge causing him to eat shit into the curb. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but I was certainly amused. Once we were onto their little scam, they no longer hid it from us. It progressed into pizza deliveries, and there was even a contest to see who could nab the order with the biggest receipt. They justified it all by claiming yuppies were placing the orders.<BR>

Things immediately started going wrong for flatland. The music man cued up the wrong song on the tape player, and Dennis stopped his run to set things straight. It took about ten minutes to get the music cued right, after which Dennis finally started. Dennis knew this run would determine the Flatland title for the year, and it looked as though the pressure had gotten to him. He rode okay, but it wasn't anything close to what he's capable of. He had purposely cut down on the difficulty of this routine so he could win easily, but he choked. He touched down five or six times, including two or three full step-offs.<BR>

<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> I rode the ramp in the Florida contest, and the following weekend there were some shows in Kansas City, Missouri, put on by a local team. My girlfriend runs the team, and I was there practicing the day before. I got real psyched because I'd learned a new trick, and I wanted to ride in the show. So I talked to her, and she let me ride in the show under another name. It was the best I'd ever ridden ramps in my life. It felt great because I was in a show situation where I had the motivation to go for it for the crowd, but I didn't have to worry about falling like in a contest. During a contest I'd be going: &quot;Yeah! It'd be great if I could go for a four-foot fakie. but if I fall they're going to count off points?' At the show I could just get going full speed and try it, because it really didn't matter. </SPAN><BR>

<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> It's hard to say, the hyperspastic fork spin, G-string, squeaker whip, reverse whiplash, spinning decade. The <B>backwards whiplash</B> is my newest. I'm really stoked on learning that. I actually learned it three or four days before I left for the ABA Freestyle Nationals round 1 contest; I can't remember for sure. I worked really hard to dial it in for this contest, 'cause having a new trick changes my whole attitude about a contest. It makes me feel as though I've got something to lean on. If I don't hit my routine as planned, at least I'm going to impress people with a new trick. That's usually what they remember; people go home talking about who did new tricks, not, &quot;Well, so and so didn't touch?' I think that's why Kevin Jones is so popular. Every contest I see, the main thing I remember is the new stuff he had at the contest.</SPAN><BR>

McCoy has been really hot this year, winning Pro Flatland almost every time he enters it and doing almost as well in Pro Ramps. He shredded here. On flatland, his run was a showpiece of high-speed rolling moves. He'd circle around behind the ramps to get going as fast as he could, then pull off electrifying multiple whiplashes as he ripped across the floor. His confidence level must be incredibly high. One of his hottest combos was a double backwards whiplash into a funky chicken. He whipped, spun and danced on his tires. He jammed.  On ramps, he came out firing with a high nine-plus air and returned with a nofooted candybar, a topside no-footed cancan, and a one-hand no-footed cancan. Dennis was ripping! Not only was he hitting some of the toughest variations possible, he was doing them all high, high like Blyther high! He tossed in a rock-walk drop-in (the coolest lip trick of the season) and ended with a really high lookdown fakie. Except for falling on a backwards drop-in, this was one hot routine.<BR>

<B>Interview</B> in American Freestyler may 1988<BR>
<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis:</SPAN><SPAN class="je"> Basically, my whole day is devoted to freestyle in some way except for eating or sleeping. that type of stuff. I usually get up. grab something to eat and get ready as quickly as I can to go out and ride. Sometimes I lag and it takes me a couple of hours before I even get out of the house. I'd say that a couple of nights on the weekends we practice for eight or nine hours straight. But on the average lately it's been between four and five hours on flatland. As soon as the weather gets better, I'll ride the ramp for a couple hours a day. I practice with <A href="thorne.htm"><B>Rick Thorne</B></A> basically every night. He keeps the same schedule I do 'cause he has a job he works part-time. We go down to an underground parking lot and practice every day of the week. Sunday through Thursday we go to a specific parking lot and practice for hours at night. Then on the weekend there's a different parking lot we all practice at. We go there to meet. and there are 20 or 30 kids there flatlanding. I don't have to call anybody. I used to have to motivate people to ride on the weekends, but now the scene's real cool and everybody's up there showing off their tricks. It motivates me and Rick a little more to learn something new. We don't have to set some far-off goal: &quot;Hey. I want to get this trick dialed in for this contest that's coming up in two months:' We'll be like: &quot;Yeah, if I get this down, I can't wait to show everybody this weekend?' It's like having jam circles at the contests, only it's local talent rather than talent from all around the country. Jam circles and riding by yourself are two totally different types of riding. Riding by yourself is a time when you think up new tricks to dial in. It's like concentrated riding where you try to dial in the tricks you have. But jam circles are pretty much the payoff for all the work you put into tricks. It's your chance to show everybody and pull it off when it counts. It's fun to hit a trick, but it's a lot more fun to hit it in front of a group of people.<BR>

Dumptruck, deathtruck, macaroni, rolling over-and-outs, rolling over-andins, and other such exciting executed exotica on flatland. On vert, Dennis was definitely not having an on day. A hard bail during an attempted grasshopper drop-in (he flies out and lands on the deck facing away from the transition, then hops back hard and lands his front wheel next to coping and does a backwards drop-in) in practice seemed to detune him a bit. He did, however, pull the dropin during his run.<BR>

Sixth place stuntmen flat was Dennis McCoy's, who used to rip the flatland class in 1987. Riding all classes and keeping up with all the latest tricks is hard, even for the real McCoy.

Dennis hasn't been the same since his concussion in Dallas, and he seems convinced that backflips are the way to go out. Dennis backflipped the jump and nearly pulled a flip twist. Dennis' Big Trick came in his last run. He cleared off the vert deck and tried a 450 transfer to the spine of the mini ramp. Dennis looked like he was just spinning out of control aiming for the spine. On vert, DMC kept up the pressure on Matt with tailtap barspins, nose wheelies, toothpicks, but bailed hard on a 900 attempt.<BR>

On flat, Dennis McCoy rolled out and took the two worst flatland bails most people had ever seen. He may not have the newest tricks, but still has the speed and the footwork. Fourth place and the Stuntmen year end title for DMC. On vert, Dennis was still riding off his jazz from the night before, so come Sunday he was pumped. He clocked an abundance of lip tricks with bar spins thrown in for good measure. Dennis also pulled a half-bar-spin 540 before careening off the side of the ramp, straight into a pile of bikes. He managed to get up and spin a 900 that almost succeeded, but he unfortunately washed out on landing.  When DMC is on, he is on. On mini he pulled 360 manuals to 360 barspins, 900 manuals, framestand nosepicks, and the trick of the mini ramp contest: he twisted up two backflips over the spine to fakie. Both times, he landed 50/50 on the spine and simply foot-planted in like it was no big deal. Respect goes out to Dennis on that one. First place for the comp.<BR>

To repair a torn ligament, three bones were fused together damaging my carpal tunnel nerve during the process. &nbsp;&nbsp;It took 14 weeks before I could tie my shoe. &nbsp;The range of motion in that wrist is severely limited, and with flatland requiring so much support of your body weight it's the most painful discipline for me to ride. &nbsp;However, flatland is in my blood so I can't help but ride it on occasion and I continue to incorporate flatland tricks into street, park, mini and vert.</SPAN><BR>

Dennis is organizing the bike part of the first Gravity Games.<BR>
<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis McCoy, www.bmxtrix.com, 1999:</SPAN><B> </B><SPAN class="je">It's essentially NBC's version of the X-Games. You know, their not hiding the fact that ESPN has done it already and they are coming in and doing their version of it. I guess the plus for the riders is that they are going to have a bigger street course for the riders so we can do even more. They are also going to have a larger pro purse than the X-Games. So hopefully that will have a sort of trickle down effect and the X-Games will raise their's next year.</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN class="qoq">Dennis McCoy, Ride BMX US february 2006:</SPAN> <SPAN class="je">I ran a few comps back in the '80s and found the experience rewarding, but in recent years I took on an organizer role out of necessity. In 1999, I got a phone call from Wade Martin regarding a new event called the Gravity Games that was to air on NBC. Wade was hoping I could suggest a good organizer since Mat was working with ESPN at the time. The role called for someone that had experience with events, a rapport with the riders, enough knowledge of BMX to make the right suggestions, and the stubbornness to see them through. This described the exact role I was serving as the athlete rep for BMX at the X Games. I didn't want to see BMX misrepresented, so I decided to take on the role myself. Paridy [Dennis' wife] and I started a production company and have been running events ever since.</SPAN><BR>

</B>On street, DMC 360'd off the sub to the wedge and pulled all sorts of stuff on the giant sub: barspin tailtap, fufanu, 540 tailtap, Canadian nosepick, and a 270 revert to headslap rollback. On vert, he cut his eye crashing a 900 in his second run, but got back on to end his run with a flair.</TD></TR>

</B>Dennis McCoy (K2) shouldn't have been riding this weekend according to his doctor but hey, it's the X-Games and if you're qualified you should climb on top of that ramp and at least drop in. It didn't show that Dennis was having any problems. At age 33 he busted a high table, huge 540, turndown, barspin, called a time out to switch bikes and take a little breather and continued with a barspin to barspin back. DMC finished his run with a flair that he crashed.<BR>

Dennis runs the bike part of the Gravity Games with his wife Paridy.<BR>
</B><SPAN class="qoq">Dennis, www.fatbmx.com, september 2000: </SPAN><SPAN class="je">Working on the Gravity Games is pretty much year around. As soon as the event ends, you take a week off and then both NBC and Octagon, the people who hire us, want feedback on the event so you provide them with detailed feedback from both us and the riders. We keep them in the loop and tell them what needs to be changed. We need to come up with some criteria on how people qualify for the next year and then my wife's web site; bikesrule.com, that's the web site for the gravity games. She maintains that site which she built from scratch so she is constantly updating that with stuff about the event. As the year goes on, people qualify for the event and it is our job to send them entry forms and update bios with photographs for the press etc. A lot of it goes into it. It would be impossible to do without Paridy, she does a lot of the work.</SPAN><BR>

Interview</B> for www.fatbmx.com september 2000.<BR>
<SPAN class="je">I've got a signature bike with K2 and I'm pretty particular about what it's spec-ed with and the geometry of the bike, the graphics and everything so it's a constant job just changing or updating or making sure it's done the way it needs to be done. Same goes for Airwalk, I've got my signature shoe with them. One thing I think I'm a little bit more involved in than other riders is trying to get myself involved in some of the ad campaigns.</SPAN></TD></TR>

Dennis McCoy busted a lookback, x-up and barspin 540. He also did a straight up and down flair and big airs. On his last trick he went for a x-up flair but barely missed the landing and fell pretty hard. But it was still good for 6th.<BR>

The last couple of months have been non-stop starting with a bad slam at the Woodward West CFB. A week later <B>I won X-Games Gold in Vert in Rio</B>, then traveled to the SLC Vans Triple Crown where I knocked myself out cold on a flip 180 over the spine. &nbsp;I was back in KC for a big demo at the Kansas Speedway before heading to Denver for <B>Props Road Fools 13</B>. Ten straight days of non-stop riding with a kick ass crew ended at my friend Tom's park (Ramp Riders) in St. Louis. Then it was back to Denver for Stop 2 of the Vans Triple Crown and now back home riding Josh's backyard every day.</SPAN><BR>

<SPAN class="qoq">Steve Emig, freestylebmxtales.blogspot.com, august 2010:</SPAN> <SPAN class="je">I cannot freakin' believe that Dennis McCoy is still competing on vert. Actually, after all his falls, I can't believe Dennis even remembers his own name, let alone how to ride a bike. Way to go DMC! In addition to doing color commentary, Dennis pulled a 900 in one run, and Steve Swope commented that he was there when Dennis pulled his first 900. I, too, was there in Indianapolis in late July 1990 when Dennis pulled his first 900. I realized that Dennis McCoy has pulled 900 airs on a bike over a 20 year period. That's pretty freakin' amazing.</SPAN></TD>
