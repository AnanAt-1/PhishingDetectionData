<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cope</span></font></b> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">notes
"At least from the reign of Robert II in the 1270s the dukes (of Burgundy)
had pursued two objectives: Burgundy's independence from the French crown
and its consolidation into a powerful state. (169)" Charles, son of Philip
the Good, continued the pursuit of these objectives. He tackled this on
two fronts, and failed on both.
</span></p>


<p><img src="im-cbold.jpg" align="left" height="360" width="240"><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
He</span></font></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
and his brother-in-law, <a href="eroyal.htm#Edward4">Edward IV</a> of England,
signed a treaty in London (1474) planning the recommencement of the Hundred
Year's War, with the idea of dividing the kingdom of France between them.
They planned an invasion of France, where the English would land at Calais
and be met by a Burgundian army and proceed with their invasion of France.
Edward kept his part of the agreement and landed in France in 1475, but
was not met by Charles and the Burgundians. Charles had gotten bogged down
in a conflict in Lorraine and choose to resolve it rather than meet Edward.
Edward was naturally angered that Charles had reneged on their agreement.<a href="froy.htm#Louis11">
Louis XI</a> of France took advantage of this disarray among his enemies
and offered Edward compensation for the costs of the campaign subject to
Edward's retreat from France. Edward took this offer and withdrew, causing
Charles to lose, by his own actions, a chance to attack France.
</span></p>


<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Charles</span></font></b> 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">fared just as unsuccessfully
a year earlier on the front of establishing a strong and independent kingdom
for himself in his negotiations with Emperor Frederick III of the HRE.
Frederick was weakened and was willing to offer the crown of Burgundy to
Charles in return for his support. They agreed in 1473 to reconstitute
the kingdom of Burgundy. This was to have happened on November 25, 1473.
Copes notes; "Historians tell of the influence brought to bear on him (Frederick)
by his advisers and the pressure exerted by Louis of France, and how he
was infuriated by the insufferable arrogance of the younger man with whom
he had almost daily contact. But in addition Frederick may have been swayed
by the conviction that Charles was doomed, and also perhaps, anyone closely
tied to him. ...(so).. only a few hours before Charles' coronation as king
of Burgundy Frederick slipped away under the cover of darkness, (172)"
and the coronation did not occur. Even though there were promises this
would happen at a later date, in fact, it never did occur.
</span></p>


<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Charles</span></font></b>,
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> therefore,
in the span of two years, lost both the opportunity for an English alliance
against the French and lost the chance for a crown in Burgundy. It was
not even possible to maintain the status quo - in 1477 Louis XI occupied
the duchy of Burgundy. Charles failed, Cope argues, because of&nbsp; his
personality and the failed Anglo Burgundian alliance. This latter was triggered
by a strategic blunder by Charles when he went to Lorraine rather than
to Calais to support Edward.
</span></p>


<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In</span></font></b>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> his troubles,
Charles was confronted and consistently out maneuvered diplomatically by
Louis XI of France. Louis had an extensive network of spies and diplomats
and was able to hold Charles at bay. In addition to settling with the English,
Louis was active in supporting Lorraine and the Swiss against Charles.
</span></p>


<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Charles</span></font></b>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> not
only lost the opportunity to establish an independent kingdom; he also
lost his life in what historians see as a series of rash military moves.
In January/February 1477 Charles crossed the Jura Mountains to confront
the Swiss. This winter campaign was against the advice of many of his senior
military officers. Instead it was the Swiss who closed on the Burgundian
army at Grandson and soundly defeated it. Charles' defeat weakened his
hold on many of his traditional territories, including Savoy. Milan, which
had sided against Louis XI and favored Charles, recanted and switched alliances.
Charles recovered quickly and recrossed the Jura again and established
a military camp in the field. He regathered an army and in June was besieging
Morat. On June 22, in a disorganized battle where Charles had spread his
forces in vulnerable positions, not believing a Swiss attack was imminent,
he was again attacked. The Swiss won a great victory and killed about 10,000
Burgundians, half of Charles army. Charles escaped with a guard of 300
troops and fled.

<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">By</span></font></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">

 the start
of the next year Charles was at Nancy confronting a Lorraine/Swiss army
funded by Louis. Rene II of Lorraine provided troops and leadership in
this battle. Much of the following English text, that in "", comes from
Wikipedia, which offers a good descritption of the battle. Other descriptive
material comes from Richard Vaughan's paper in <font color="#000000"><i>Cinq-Centieme
Anniversaire de la Bataille de Nancy</i>.</font>
</span></p>


<p><img src="im-bur-cbdeath.jpg" align="left" height="285" width="360"><b><font color="#cc0000">
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Charles</span></font></b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
was besieging the city of Nancy, capital of Lorraine, following its successful
recapture by Rene, Duc de Lorraine's forces late in 1476. Despite the harsh
winter conditions Charles was determined to bring the siege to an end at
all costs as he was well aware that sooner or later Rene would arrive with
a relieving army once the weather had improved somewhat." (Wik.)&nbsp;</span></font>
(Image: Bourgogne 154)
</p>


<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The siege</span></font></b><font color="#000000">
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">was not going well. For example, a sortie from Nancy by two of Rene's captains
succeeded in encircling and capturing 900 Burgundian cavaliers. Charles
had the complication of commanding an army that was not linguistically
unified. His force included Italian mercenaries, English archers, Dutch
and Savoyard troops, as well as Burgundian forces. Further aggravating
the situation was the fact that this was an unusually cold winter and Charles
troops suffered extensively as a result. (Cinc-C.)</span></font>
</p>


<p><b><font color="#cc0000">"<span style="font-size: 12pt;">By</span></font></b><font color="#000000">
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> late December
Ren&eacute; had gathered some 10-12,000 men from Lorraine, and the Lower
Union (of the Rhine) as well as 10,000 Confederation Swiss mercenaries
to his banner. He began his advance on Nancy early in January 1477, moving
cautiously through the snow covered landscape until they reached Nancy
early on the morning of 5 January. Charles finally learnt that Rene's army
was indeed close by and drew up the bulk of his army in a strong defensive
position south of Nancy on a heavily wooded slope behind a stream at the
narrowest part of the valley he knew the Swiss would have to advance down.
The exact numbers available to Charles are hard to judge, but contemporary
observers put the numbers between 4,000 and 8,000, though even his household
troops were by this stage well below strength, while most of the Ordnance
companies were at best at 50% of their theoretical strength." (Wik)</span></font>
</p>


<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"Charles</span></font></b><font color="#000000">
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> as
usual deployed his troops to a precise battle plan despite the short notice
he received of the approach of Rene's forces. The infantry companies and
dismounted gendarmes formed up in a large square formation with some 30
field guns in front at the top of the slope, while on either flank were
mounted knights and coustilliers. If Charles suffered from a lack of scouting
(which had cost him so dearly at Murten six months earlier) the same could
not be said for the Allied army. Despite the driving snow cutting visibility
to a few yards the Allied scouts soon recognized that a frontal assault
on the Burgundian position would be disastrous, so the largely Swiss Vorhut
(Vanguard) of 7,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry was instructed to attack
from the right while the principal thrust would come from the 8,000 infantry
and 1,300 cavalry of the Gewalthut (Centre) which was dispatched on a difficult
circuitous march round the left flank over thickly wooded snow covered
slopes out of view of the waiting Burgundians. The small Nachhut (Rearguard)
of 800 handgunners acted as a reserve." (Wik)</span></font>
</p>


<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Vaughan</span></font></b><font color="#000000"> 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">describes
the scene: "Le gros des troupes etait probablement porte entre deux affluents
qui se jetaient dans la Meurthe par des ravines escarpees, celles,de Jarville
et de la Madeleine. Le flanc gauche bourguignon etait protege pa la Meurthe,
le droit par la foret." (Cinq-C). In other words, Charles army turned and
faced south to confront Rene's forces.</span></font>

<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here</span></font></b><font color="#000000"> 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">are two
maps of the battlefield. The left is from <i>Cinq-Centieme Anniversaire
de la Bataille de Nancy</i>. The arrows coming from the lower right are
Rene's forces and the generally oval shapes are forests. The Meurthe is
to the right on the map. The second map is the area today. The battlefield
is not recognizable today. The roughly red oval is what was the forest
area but this is completely gone today. Today the battlefield is bisected
by a newer canal. The smaller circle is Nancy's centre ville. The red line
is the approximate location of Charles' army. The two water courses flowing
into the Meurthe, the Ruisseau de Jarville and Ruisseau de la Madeleine,
are gone today. Having driven through this area, it struck me as fairly
flat but descriptions talk about hills where the calvary gathered. The
red cross marks the approximate spot Charles was killed.</span></font>

<font color="#cc0000">"<b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">After</span></b></font><font color="#000000">
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> a march
lasting some two hours the Gewalthut emerged from the wooded slopes slightly
to the rear of the Burgundian position and formed up in a wedge formation.
(This is evident on the map above, where the Swiss flank the Burgundians
and come at them from behind.) The early notes of the Swiss alpenhorns
sounded thrice and the Swiss charged downhill into the Burgundian positions.
The artillery attempted to retrain on the Gewalthut but could not elevate
enough to be effective, the single volley discharged killing but two men.
Although the right wing Burgundian cavalry saw off their Swiss rivals the
mass of Swiss infantry pushed on to engage the outnumbered Burgundian infantry
square in a one-sided fight. The Vorhut threw back the Burgundian left
wing and put the artillery to flight. As Charles attempted to vainly stem
the Gewalthut's advance by transferring troops from his left flank the
sheer weight of numbers arrayed against him became obvious and the once
proud army of the Duchy of Burgundy started to melt away in flight. Determined
to the last, Charles and his staff tried in vain to rally the broken army,
but without success. His small band was carried with the flight until eventually
surrounded by a party of Swiss. A halberdier quickly swung at the Duke's
head and landed a deadly blow directly on his helmet. He was seen to fall
but the battle flowed on around him. It was three days till the Duke's
disfigured body was finally found and positively identified amongst the
detritus of the slaughter." (Wik)</span></font>

<p><b><font color="#cc0000"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rather</span></font></b> 
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">than withdraw in the face
of a 10,000 strong force, Charles, with his 3000 unenthusiastic troops
stood and fought.&nbsp; It was a Burgundian rout, and Charles was killed.
From Kendall (p.314) "The furious devotee of Mars, who had shown all the
qualities of a great general except generalship and all the trappings of
a conqueror except victories, lay face down on a frozen pond, stripped
naked. His head had been cloven from top to chin by a Swiss halberd; his
body was pierced through by Swiss pikes; the bloody ruin of his face was
unrecognizable. Captured servants of his made positive identification by
the long nails, the missing upper tooth&nbsp; and several scars on the
body."
