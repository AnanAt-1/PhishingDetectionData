<H2><A NAME="tourism">About Ottawa</A></H2>

Ottawa, Canada's Capital, sits on the border of the province of
Ontario in central Canada. It was made capital of the British
colonial Province of Canada in 1857.

Since 1969, Ottawa and Hull have been formally recognized as
Canada's "capital area."

<P>

Canada's Capital straddles the border of two provinces (Quebec
and Ontario), contains two major cities (Ottawa and Gatineau) and
has two official languages (French and English).

The Rideau Canal (built through the wilderness from 1826 to 1832
to link Ottawa to the Great Lakes) was one of the great engineering
feats of the 19th century.

<P>

Ottawa is one of four capitals (with London, Johannesburg and
Budapest) that are neo-Gothic in style and spirit. The complex,
picturesque quality of Gothic design distinguishes these from
neo-classical Rome, Paris and Washington, which are characterized
by a spirit of monumental grandeur.

Ottawa and Gatineau are home to eight national museums, storehouses
of Canadian culture.

<H2><A NAME="first">About FIRST</A></H2>

The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) is
an international organization that brings together a variety of
computer security incident response teams. These teams include
government, commercial, and academic organizations. Worldwide, FIRST
aims to foster cooperation and coordination in incident prevention,
to prompt rapid reaction to incidents, and to promote information
sharing among members and the global community at large. Further
information about the FIRST organization is available
