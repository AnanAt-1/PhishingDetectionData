<H1>The Cotton Mills</H1>

<H2>Growth and Decline</H2>
<P>
Before the middle of the nineteenth century, India used to export cotton
to Britain, and then reimport the textile. In 1820 the total textile
import cost only Rs. 350,000. However, these costs escalated tremendously
until in 1860 textile imports stood at Rs. 19.3 million.
</P>

<P>
The impetus towards the founding of a cotton industry came from Indian
entrepreneurs. The first Indian cotton mill, &quot;The Bombay Spinning
Mill&quot;, was opened in 1854 in Bombay by Cowasji Nanabhai Davar.
Opposition from the Lancashire mill owners was eventually offset by the
support of the British manufacturers of textile machinery.
</P>

<P>
By 1870 there were 13 mills in Bombay. Cotton exports grew during the
American Civil War, when supplies from the USA were interrupted.
At the end of 1895 there were 70 mills; growing to 83 in 1915. A period
of stagnation set in during the recession of the 1920's. In 1925 there
were 81 mills in the city. After World War II,
under strong competition from Japan, the mills declined. In 1953 there
remained only 53 mills in the city.
</P>

<H2>The Cotton Boom</H2>
<P>
The growth of the cotton industry was spurred, and for a small time
eclipsed, by the the cotton boom. Before the American Civil War, the
mills of England imported only 20% of their cotton from India. With the
blockade of the Confederate ports, Indian cotton prices rose. By 1865,
when General Lee's army surrendered, Bombay had earned 70 million pounds
sterling in the cotton trade.
</P>

<P>
This money spurred on a financial bubble, with
<A HREF="/bombay/physical/geo/backbay-reclamation.html">land reclamation
schemes</A> and the dock yards attracting huge investments. By January
1865 Bombay had 31 banks, 8 reclamation companies, 16 cotton pressing
companies, 10 shipping companies, 20 insurance companies and 62 joint
stock companies. Within two months the American Civil War ended and most
of these companies went into liquidation. Large numbers of speculators
became bankrupt. However, wealth had been created and this led immediately
to an industrial growth.
</P>

<H2>Indian Entrepreneurship</H2>
<P>
The cotton mills of Bombay, and the rest of India, were owned and managed
mainly by Indians. The initial investments came from families of the
mill-owners, mainly obtained from trading. Later, when shares became
available to the public, much of the ownership still remained Indian. As
an example, of the 53 mills in the city in 1925, only 14 were British
owned. The management and directorships of these mills were also mainly
Indian. Of the 386 directorships recorded in 1925, only 44 were English.
</P>

<H2>Social Dimensions</H2>
<P>
The rapid growth in mills was sustained by a <A HREF="/bombay/stats/pop_stat/index.html">
large migration</A> of mainly Marathi speaking workers into the city.
Most often, the male member of the family would work in Bombay, leaving
the rest of the family in the village. These workers were initially
accommodated in hostels. Eventually, these <EM CLASS="foreign" LANG="hi">chawls</EM> became tenements,
with full families crammed into single rooms. The mills filled up
<A HREF="/bombay/physical/geo/parel.html">Parel</A> and then expanded
westwards all the way to <A HREF="/bombay/physical/geo/worli.html">Worli</A>.
</P>

<P>
The <A HREF="/bombay/stats/pop_stat/density.html">high density of
population</A>, coupled with low pays and insanitary living conditions
caused high morbidity rates in Bombay. The infamous <A HREF="plague.html">
plague epidemics</A> at the end of the 19th century only equalled the
morbidity due to other diseases. The efforts of the
<A HREF="/bombay/amenities/orgs/cit.html">City Improvement Trust</A> to
better living conditions was only partially successful. Many of today's
slums are the byproducts of the cotton boom; as much so as the Victorian
Gothic architecture of the <A HREF="/bombay/physical/geo/fort.html">Fort
area</A>.
