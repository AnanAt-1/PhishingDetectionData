<h1>Webalizer</h1>

<a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/">The Webalizer</a> - An open source program for server log analysis.	It examines server logs and generates html reports based on the contents.  Paste the following configuration sections into webalizer.conf to add powerful customization to Webalizer.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p><big><a href="search.txt">search.txt</a></big> -  Webalizer can pick out the search terms from your logs that are left behind in the referrer field when a visitor comes from a search engine.  The default config it only picks out terms from Yahoo.  This list of several dozen of the largest search engines along with their names and the search string
keywords makes Webalizer much more powerful and accurate.</br>
Updated: February 23, 2005</p>

<p><big><a href="sites.txt">sites.txt</a></big> - If you have hostname data about the visitors to your website, you can get information on which 
parts of the world and which ISPs most of the people visiting come from.  The default configuration
for Webalizer only groups AOL users.   This is not an exhaustive list, but should group most of the top ISPs as well as a few known spiders.<br>

<h2>Log Sorting</h2>
<p>Webalizer does not deal well with log files that are not completly sorted.
If you find that webalizer is ignoring a lot of records, unsorted logs are one
culprit.  Not finding a log sorting program, I wrote one that sorts web logs 
that are in combined log format.</p>

<p>Log files are assumed to be semi-sorted.   If
too many log entries are out of order, an error
message will be printed and you should try again
with a larger look ahead pool size.</p>

<p>If P is the look ahead pool size, N is the number of log entries
and F is the number of files, this program will run
in order N*F*Log(P) time.  (Notice that it is not optimized
for a large number of files and that it will run faster
with a smaller look ahead pool.)</p>

<h3>Downloading:</h3>

<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/webapps/getjava/BrowserRedirect?locale=en&host=www.java.com:80" target="_new">Download</a> and install the Java2 Software Developer Kit (SDK) from java.sun.com if you do not already have it installed.</p>

<p><a href="LogSorter.java">Download</a> the source code for the log sorter.</p>

<h3>Usage:</h3>

<p>First compile the source code:<br>
<code>javac&nbsp;LogSorter.java</code></p>

<p>This program either reads form standard input (with no arguments)
or from each of the files specified as arguments.  Output always
is written to standard output, errors to standard error.  If you
wish to sort logs and remove duplicate entries or if you want to
bump up the look ahead pool size, simply recompile the program with
those options.</p> 

<h3>Examples:</h3>
<h4>Sorting a singe log file:</h4>
<code>java&nbsp;LogSorter&nbsp;access.log&nbsp;>&nbsp;sorted_access.log</code>
<h4>Merging log files from several servers:</h4>
<code>java&nbsp;LogSorter&nbsp;server1_access.log&nbsp;server2_access.log&nbsp;server3_access.log&nbsp;>&nbsp;sorted_access.log</code>
<h4>Merging rotated log files:</h4>
<code>cat&nbsp;access1999.log&nbsp;access2000.log&nbsp;access2001.log&nbsp;|&nbsp;java&nbsp;LogSorter&nbsp;>&nbsp;sorted_access.log</code><br>
(concatinating all the log files and sending them to standard input has
effect of running this program with one log file rather than F files.)
<h4>Sending the output directly to Webalizer</h4>
<code>java&nbsp;LogSorter&nbsp;access.log&nbsp;|&nbsp;webalizer</code>
<h4>Sending the output to gzip:</h4>
<code>java&nbsp;LogSorter&nbsp;access.log&nbsp;|&nbsp;gzip&nbsp;>&nbsp;sorted_access.log.gz</code>
<h4>Sorting gzipped log files:</h4>
<code>gunzip&nbsp;-c&nbsp;access.log.gz&nbsp;|&nbsp;java&nbsp;LogSorter&nbsp;|&nbsp;gzip&nbsp;>&nbsp;sorted_access.log.gz</code>
