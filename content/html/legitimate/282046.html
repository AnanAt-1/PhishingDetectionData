</CENTER>
<BR>
R-Comp Interactive is pleased to present a super collection of
StrongArm/RO4 upgrades and complete games originally released by Krisalis.
Krisalis specialised in porting games to RISC OS from other machines, in
much the same way as RCI have done with hit games like Doom and Heroes of Might
and Magic 2. The CD is designed to bring your existing Krisalis games up to
date, and also provide you with some of the ones you may have missed.  There
are electronic, printable manuals for all the games.  As an added bonus, the
Gremlin games Zool and Premier Manager are also included in new and updated
forms, specially for this CD!

Some games, but not all, have also been upgraded to work with Arm610/710 and 7500 machines such as
the original RiscPCs, RiscStation R7500 lite and Mico.<BR>
<BR>
Please note, that whilst every effort has been made to ensure that the supplied patches work
on as many machines as possible, the age of the games means that some may require specific
screen modes etc. to run at the correct speed and with correct graphics.  We have tried to
ensure that the games deal with this automatically (especially on standard Acorn monitors
such as the 14 inch AKF60 and 17 inch AKF85).  However, if you are using an obscure monitor,
it is possible that a small number of games may not be quite right.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, where complete games are included, patches are not supplied because they aren't
needed!
