<p>SudokuME is a Sudoku (or 'Su Doku') game for your Java-enabled phone or 
handheld device.  Now you can fill up those idle moments on a train or at the 
airport with a challenging game of Sudoku - and all you need is a phone or 
similar device.</p>

<p>Unlike some mobile other Sudoku games, SudokuME provides a compact yet 
feature rich environment in which to tackle each puzzle.  The ability to lock
certain cells and to make note of your <i>working out</i> is provided via 
a simple yet effective interface.  SudokuME will also automatically 
highlight duplicate cells, and check your solution to ensure it is correct.  
SudokuME also supports Sudoku games on either 9x9 or the more challenging 
12x12 grids.  You can also download ready-made puzzles from an archive 
straight onto your phone - or input your own puzzle (perhaps from your 
favourite newspaper?)  You can also save numerous games onto your phone's 
persistent memory, and pick them up where you left off later.</p>

<p>In version 1.3 a timer has been added, to allow players to time how long
they take to solve a given puzzle, and an undo feature is now supported,
with the previous twenty changes recorded and capable of being re-wound.</p>

<a name="what"><h2>What is Sudoku?</h2></a>

<img class="diag1" src="./shot7.png" alt="A Sudoku puzzle"/>
<p>Sudoku is an addictive number-based puzzle, rumoured to have originated
in Japan.  The rules are blissfully simple:  <i>Fill in the missing values
such that each row, column, and 3x3 inner grid contains all the values,
1 to 9.</i></p>

<p>Take for example the cell marked with a red cross in the diagram.  By
a process of elimination, it is possible to deduce that this cell <b>must</b> 
hold the value 7.</p>

<br clear="both"/>

<p>This is how we might work it out...</p>
<ul>
<li>1, 5, 4, and 8 are already present in the inner grid.</li>
<li>2, 6 and 9 are present on the row.</li>
<li>3 is present on the column.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cell immediately to the right of our target cell can have the value
3 or 7.  Now we have deduced our target cell is 7, we know the rightmost
cell <b>must</b> be 3.  And so the process continues, until we have 
correctly established the value of every empty cell.</p>

<p>And that's all there is to it!</p>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<a name="keys"><h2>The Keys</h2></a>

<img class="diag1" src="./keys1.png" alt="Keys guide"/>

<p>SudokuME is written in Java (Java2 Micro Edition), which allows it to run 
across a wide range of mobile devices without modification.  The mobile 
market is populated by a huge number of different device models and types.  
Java smooths over the differences between devices by dictating that nine
'game' buttons must be available on all devices.  It is up to the user
(you!) to figure out how these 'game' keys map to the real buttons on
your phone or handheld device.</p>

<p>On top of this Java allows access to the 'soft' buttons which are used 
as function keys by phones, typically tied to labels which may appear on 
the screen's footer.  Java has less control over these keys, with the phone 
able to assign 'soft' buttons to actual physical keys as it sees fit.
If a given phone has fewer physical buttons than required soft buttons, it 
will typically turn one of them into a menu key from where the 'missing' 
buttons can be selected (as menu items).  Most phones have at least two
soft buttons - this documentation is written with that assumption.</p>

<br clear="both"/>

<ul>
<li><span class="key">UP</span>, <span class="key">DOWN</span>,
	<span class="key">LEFT</span> and <span class="key">RIGHT</span> must be
	present to indicate a direction.  Many phones have a specific 'joystick' 
	type control for navigating menus etc.  Java typically will make use of
	this, but if not present the keys 2, 4, 6 and 8 on the keypad may be
	used as an alternative.</li>
<li><span class="key">FIRE</span> is often mapped to the 'select'
	function of the 'joystick' control on phones which have it.  Alternatively
	the centre key, 5, on the keypad may be used.</li>
<li><span class="key">GAME&nbsp;A</span>, <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;B</span>, 
	<span class="key">GAME&nbsp;C</span> and <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;D</span> are
	all extra game keys which may be mapped to extra navigation keys, although
	often they are mapped to the corner keys on the keypad: 1, 3, 7 and 9.</li>
<li><span class="key">SOFT&nbsp;1</span> and <span class="key">SOFT&nbsp;2</span>
	are the aforementioned soft keys (function keys) which the phone can 
	assign to various purposes, with a labels typically placed on the footer 
	of the phone's screen.
</ul>

<p>You may need to experiment a little when you first play SudokuME to
discover how your phone's manufacturer has mapped Java's game keys to 
the physical buttons on your phone or handhelp device.  (The configuration 
will be the same for all Java software running on your phone, so you may 
alternatively like to consult your device's manual or the online 
documentation of the manufacturer.)</p>

<p>One final note: although I have labeled the soft keys 
<span class="key">SOFT&nbsp;1</span> and <span class="key">SOFT&nbsp;2</span>,
they may not appear in that order on your given phone.  (Indeed these are
just convenient labels for function keys which may not even appear as
physical buttons on your phone at all - although in most cases they will be.)  
Each manufacturer must determine how and where these 'soft' keys will 
appear.</p>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<a name="mainscreen"><h2>The Main Screen</h2></a>

<p>From here you can load and delete a saved game, create an empty grid to
create your own game, or download game from online.</p>

<p>There are three tabs, which can be moved between using the <span class="key">SOFT 1</span>
and <span class="key">SOFT 2</span> keys.  <span class="onScreen">Load</span>
shows a menu of games currently saved onto your phone.  <span class="onScreen">New</span>
shows a menu for creating new games from scratch (as well as an in-built example
game).  <span class="onScreen">Online</span> shows a list of games available
over the Web.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: Moving to the Online tab will cause SudokuME to attempt to read
data from the network.  Your phone may display a warning about this.</b></p>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<a name="loadtab"><h2>The 'Load' Tab</h2></a>

<img class="diag1" src="./shot1.png" alt="Screenshot 1"/>
<img class="diag1" src="./shot5.png" alt="Screenshot 5"/>

<p>The <span class="onScreen">Load</span> tab allows you to load and delete
saved games on your phone.  Use the <span class="key">UP</span> and 
<span class="key">DOWN</span> keys to navigate through the list.  If the list 
is bigger than the space on the screen, it will scroll accordingly.  Naturally 
if you have not yet saved any games, the list will be empty.  To select a 
game and have it load, simple press <span class="key">FIRE</span> when 
highlighting the desired save game record.</p>

<br clear="both"/>

<p>Use the <span class="key">LEFT</span> and <span class="key">RIGHT</span> 
keys to flip between the various pieces of save game data.  These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title - the save game's title (up to 20 characters).</li>
<li>Record id and size - the save game's record id number and size (bytes).</li>
<li>Timer - the time currently accumulated on this game.</li>
</ul>

Record id and size are of use if your phone has only limited storage space
available.  To save space SudokuME compresses game data to reduce the number
of bytes it takes to store.  This enables the player to have many unfinished
games on the go at once, without fear of filling up precious storage space
on their phone.  In the example screenshot, two games are displayed.  The 
first has the identity number 4, and is 84 bytes in size.  The second has 
an identity number of 3, and is 115 bytes.</p>

<p>To delete a record press the <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;A</span> button 
while highlighting the desired save game record.  A menu will appear, asking 
you to confirm your action.  Use the <span class="key">UP</span> and
<span class="key">DOWN</span> keys to navigate this menu, and the
<span class="key">FIRE</span> key to make your selection.</p>

<h3 class="new">Upgrading</h3>
<p class="new"><span class="new">Upgrading from v1.2x to v1.3</span>: version
1.3 will read save game records from 1.2x, so you can continue with your
existing games after updating the application.  However, the title and
timer were not available prior to 1.3, and thus for old records the title
will be set to "Untitled game" and the timer will begin at zero.  (When 1.2x 
games are subsequently saved, they are written out in the new 1.3 format.)</p>

<br clear="both"/>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<a name="newtab"><h2>The 'New' Tab</h2></a>

<img class="diag1" src="./shot2.png" alt="Screenshot 2"/>

<p>The <span class="onScreen">New</span> tab allows you to create an empty
grid.  This is useful when copying a game from, perhaps, a newspaper or
book of Sudoku puzzles.  The third option allows you to play a test game.
The test game is an in-built game which is useful for getting familiar with
SudokuME's controls.  (Perhaps in future this test game option will be
replaced by an option to generate brand new Sudoku games?)</p>

<br clear="both"/>
<ul>
<li><span class="onScreen">9x9 grid</span> creates an empty grid of size nine
	by nine.</li>
<li><span class="onScreen">12x12 grid</span> creates an empty grid of size twelve
	by twelve.</li>
<li><span class="onScreen">Test game</span> loads the in-built example game.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the <span class="key">UP</span> and <span class="key">DOWN</span> keys 
to navigate this menu, and the <span class="key">FIRE</span> key to make your 
selection.</p>

<br clear="both"/>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<a name="onlinetab"><h2>The 'Online' Tab</h2></a>

<img class="diag1" src="./shot11.png" alt="Screenshot 11"/>
<img class="diag1" src="./shot3.png" alt="Screenshot 3"/>
<img class="diag1" src="./shot4.png" alt="Screenshot 4"/>

<p>The <span class="onScreen">Online</span> tab is used to download puzzles
from an archive on the Web.  When you access this tab, you may be prompted
to grant permission for SudokuME to access the network.  You will need to
give this permission if you want to use this feature.  Typically SudokuME
downloads only small parcels of information, often less than 2k in size.</p>

<p>The online archive is divided up into two parts.  Sudoku puzzles are
gathered in collections known as 'bundles', while an available catalogue of 
all known bundles is available on the Web.  When you first access the 
<span class="onScreen">Online</span> tab the catalogue will attempt to
be loaded.  And once successfully loaded, is displayed.</p>

<p>In version 1.3 of SudokuME the catalogue has been adapted to have multiple 
directories - the previous version's flat list would have eventually grown 
too long and cumbersome to use.  Directories are signified by two 'greater
than' / 'less than' symbols around their name (see diagram).</p>

<p>In the three diagrams we see a progression from the top level down
towards a specific bundle.  The first diagram shows two directories,
"Daily Telegraph" and "SudokuME".  Having selected the first, a list
of bundles is display, as per the second diagram.  Having selected the
first bundle (containing nine games) the list of games inside that bundle 
is shown, as demonstrated in diagram three.</p>

<p>Navigation is done using the <span class="key">UP</span> and 
<span class="key">DOWN</span> keys, while the <span class="key">FIRE</span> 
key makes your selection.  Selecting a bundle (diagram two) will cause 
further network activity while the bundle loads.  Once loaded, the bundle's 
contents will be available for selection (diagram three).</p>

<p>SudokuME will retain in memory the catalogue and bundle you have 
selected, unless you quit or pause the SudokuME application (for example, 
to receive an incoming call).  Hopefully this will further reduce the 
amount of loading across the Internet your phone will need to do.</p>

<p>You may use the <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;A</span> key to retreat from 
any level of this list back up to the previous level.</p>

<p>See the section <a href="#onlinegames">Online Game Sources</a> for more
information on the titles of the various games, and where they 
originate.</p>

<a name="gamescreen"><h2>The Game Screen</h2></a>

<img class="diag1" src="./shot6.png" alt="Screenshot 7"/>
<img class="diag1" src="./shot8.png" alt="Screenshot 8"/>

<p>Playing the game is as simple as navigating around the grid using the
<span class="key">UP</span>, <span class="key">DOWN</span>,
<span class="key">LEFT</span> and <span class="key">RIGHT</span> keys, 
while toggling the value in a given cell using the 
<span class="key">FIRE</span> key.</p>

<p>If you should happen to put a value in a cell which is invalid, due
to it being repeated on the current column, row or the inner grid, SudokuME
will highlight in red all other 'offending' cells <b>for the current cell
only.</b></p> 

<br clear="both"/>

<img class="diag1" src="./shot9.png" alt="Screenshot 9"/>

<p>It is often handy to keep track of your 'working out' - possible values
which you consider are suitable candidates for a given cell.  Players
using a 'hardcopy' Sudoku game (for example, from a book or newspaper)
often pencil in their <i>working out</i> as small numbers into a given 
cell.  This isn't really possible with SudokuME - for one thing, the
display size on mobile devices is far too small to show tiny <i>working
out</i> numbers.</p>

<p>As an alternative, pressing the <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;B</span> key 
allows you to toggle between the main grid and a separate <i>working out</i> 
area below.  Using the <span class="key">LEFT</span> and 
<span class="key">RIGHT</span> keys, along with 
<span class="key">FIRE</span>, you can toggle on or off a given value in 
the <i>working out</i> selection.</p>

<p>Only the <i>working out</i> for the current highlighted cell is shown.  
A small dot 'marker' is placed onto the main grid as a hint as to which 
cells contain <i>working out</i> and which do not.</p>

<p><i>(See elsewhere for details of how using the working out feature
impacts on the size of save game records.)</i></p>

<br clear="both"/>

<p>The <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;C</span> key allows you to toggle the lock
on and off for the current hightlighted cell.  A locked cell appears in a 
darker shade (bold) and cannot be changed.  Use this feature to highlight
cells which were filled out at the start of the puzzle - or to secure
from accidental change cells which you are confident are correct .</p>

<p>The <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;D</span> key acts as a SHIFT key (like
on a computer keyboard).  Holding it down while pressing one of the other
keys gives access to extra features.  In the list below they are given
as <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;D+???</span>, where <i>???</i> represents
the other key.  Because phone keypads can sometimes be awkward to use,
a banner sporting the legend <b>&lt;&lt;&nbsp;SHIFT&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</b> appears below
the grid while the <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;D</span> key is held.</p>

<p>The <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;D+B</span> key displays
the game timer.  (The timer is also accessible via the About menu.
See later for details).</p>

<p>The <span class="key">GAME&nbsp;D+C</span> key will perform
an undo function.  SudokuME will store up to twenty of the previous 
changes to the grid values (but not the <i>working out</i> or locks) and
can reverse these changes with repeated presses of this key.</p>

<p>Here's a list of keys and what they do:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="key">UP</span>, <span class="key">DOWN</span>,
	<span class="key">LEFT</span> and <span class="key">RIGHT</span> : 
	navigate the grid or working out area.</li>
<li><span class="key">FIRE</span> : toggle through the possible value
	of an unlocked cell on the grid, or toggle on/off a value in the
	working out area.</li>
<li><span class="key">SOFT 2</span> : bring up the menu (see below).</li>
<li><span class="key">GAME&nbsp;B</span> : toggle between grid and working out 
	areas.</li>
<li><span class="key">GAME&nbsp;C</span> : toggle lock on/off.</li>
<li><span class="key">GAME&nbsp;D+B</span> : show timer.</li>
<li><span class="key">GAME&nbsp;D+C</span> : undo.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Of particular note here are the <span class="onScreen">About</span>,
<span class="onScreen">Working</span> and <span class="onScreen">Solved?</span> 
menu options.</p>

<p><span class="onScreen">About</span> provides information, help and allows
the current game to be re-titled.  On the opening page the current game
title and current timer are shown.  <span class="key">SOFT&nbsp;1</span>
can be used to exit back to the game, while <span class="key">SOFT&nbsp;2</span>
will cycle to the next help page.  Each help page shows the keys used in
a given part of SudokuME, and their function.  The 
<span class="key">GAME&nbsp;A</span> key will bring up a page where the
current game can be re-titled.  (Handy for assigning a name to an old v1.2x 
game, perhaps?)  The title can have a maximum of twenty characters.</p>

<p><span class="onScreen">Working</span> provides an easy way to remove
<i>working out</i> for cells which contain values.  This can be done
either for cells which are locked, or for all cells with values.  Cells 
which do not have values (are still empty) are left intact.</p>

<p>The <span class="onScreen">Solved?</span> option checks the entire
grid looking for duplicates, and marks them in red.  This is a handy
feature for when you have completed a Sudoku puzzle, and want to check
if your solution is correct.  Instead of moving the cursor over each
cell in turn, looking for duplicates highlighted in red, simply use the 
<span class="onScreen">Solved?</span> option and any duplicates anywhere
on the grid will be highlighted.  (If nothing is highlighted, then
congratulations - you have solved your puzzle!)</p>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
<a name="savegamenote"><h2>A Note on Save Game Records</h2></a>

<p>SudokuME attempts to compress (using a scheme known as Run Length 
Encoding) as much data in the online bundles and save game records as
possible.  This reduces their size and thereby makes them smaller to
store (save game) and quicker to load across a network (online).</p>

<p>The <i>working out</i> feature of SudokuME is very useful - <b>but</b>
it requires a large body of data to function.  It is recommended therefore
that users clean up <i>working out</i> data once it is no longer needed
(for example, because you have now determined the value of the cell to
which it it associated) so that the RLE compression software can better
reduce the size of your save games.</p>

<p>To help you do this, a handy <span class="onScreen">Working</span>
option has been added to the main game menu.</p>


<!-- ================================================================== -->
