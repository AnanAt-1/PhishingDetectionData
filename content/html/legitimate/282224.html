Z88
Computer







                    </strong>is an A4 size notebook computer based
                    around the popular Z80 processor, with built in
                    Pipedream word processor, spreadsheet, database,
                    BASIC, assembler, calculator, clock, alarm,
                    calendar, printer editor and VT52 Terminal.</font></p>
                <p> <font face="Verdana" size="3">The Z88 is the most
                    portable full-function computer ever devised, with a
                    full sized silent keyboard, integrated display (8
                    lines x 80 characters) and yet being able to run for
                    approximately 20 hours on 4xAA Alkaline
                    batteries.&nbsp; All this and the machine is still
                    less than an inch thick, measures 11&frac12; in x
                    8&frac14; in (A4 paper size) and weighs under 2
                    lb.&nbsp; It's silent keyboard makes it ideal for
                    working discreetly in libraries and archive
                    sections, for example when researching family trees.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">The computer runs on
                    mains or 4xAA batteries (give approx 20 hours active
                    life or approx 1 year on standby). A built in
                    capacitor preserves data when the batteries need to
                    be changed.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">The word processor and
                    spreadsheet are both extremely user-friendly, with
                    all commands listed in the menu and a page map to
                    indicate whereabouts on the current page you are
                    working.&nbsp; Files are stored in a very memory
                    compact format, with 3x 1Mb RAM cards sufficient to
                    hold the entire works of Shakespeare.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">The Z88 can export,
                    import and manipulate data from IBM- compatible PCs;
                    converting its own applications software into
                    Wordstar or Lotus 1-2-3 files.&nbsp; It is also
                    possible to link this popular notebook to PC, Apple
                    Mac, Sinclair QL, BBC Micro, Commodore Amiga and
                    Archimedes Computers, to allow easy transfer and
                    storage of files.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">Extra memory comes in
                    solid-state, interchangeable packs- only 2 1/5 in
                    square x 3/8 in deep. No fragile disks, no bulky
                    disk drives.&nbsp; However, it is possible to link a
                    disk drive to the Cambridge Z88, using a system such
                    as RangerDisk 2, which allows the Z88 to write to
                    and read from PC formatted 3.5" DD or HD disks,
                    ensuring easy and trouble free transfer of files
                    between the two systems.&nbsp; The Ranger Disk 2 was
                    manufactured some years ago, and we are able to
                    update the firmware (to v1.10) and Z88 DiskFiler
                    software (to v5.01) for a charge of &pound;10.&nbsp;
                    You will need to return your RangerDisk drive and
                    DiskFiler EPROM.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">The Z88 has three slots
                    to hold RAM or EPROM expansion. 32K of RAM is built
                    in as standard and is expandable to 3 megabytes.
                    This RAM depends on being battery backed up from the
                    computer and will therefore lose its contents if the
                    Z88's batteries fail, however, the on-screen display
                    keeps you informed of the current battery strength
                    and there is also permanent storage available in the
                    form of EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only
                    Memory) packs, available in 32K,128K, 256K or you
                    can use 1Mb Flash EPROMs.&nbsp; However, only slot 3
                    can be used to record data onto EPROM (the Flash
                    EPROM can be used in any slot as it is treated the
                    same as RAM).</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">A Flash EPROM is
                    recommended for serious users, as it can be
                    formatted or files deleted from the flash EPROM
                    using the Z88.&nbsp; In contrast, files stored on a
                    standard EPROM cartridge are left on the EPROM each
                    time that you update them, the old version of the
                    file simply being marked as out of date.&nbsp; This
                    can cause an EPROM to become full rather quickly,
                    and the only method of making more storage is to use
                    a separate EPROM Eraser which wipes the entire
                    contents of an EPROM at a time.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">Another popular method
                    of permanent storage for the Z88 is simply to use
                    one of the computer link kits, which enable you to
                    copy files across to a disk drive on another
                    computer and retrieve them at a later date.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">The OZ operating system
                    is built into ROM and allows task-switching between
                    applications without loading or exiting
                    programs.&nbsp; This also allows several documents
                    to be held in a suspended state, ready for immediate
                    access at the point where you last left them.&nbsp;
                    The BASIC built into the machine is an
                    implementation of BBC BASIC (with only the following
                    functions missing: CLG, COLOUR, DRAW, GCOL, MODE,
                    MOVE, PLOT, POINT, ENVELOPE, SOUND and ADVAL).&nbsp;
                    This is a fairly powerful, yet easy to understand
                    programming language with a lot of support available
                    on the internet.</font></p>

                </font> <font face="Verdana" size="3">
                  <p>One of the main problems which Z88 users face is
                    finding a compatible printer.&nbsp; When the
                    Cambridge Z88 was originally launched, the best
                    printers available were daisywheel or dot matrix
                    printers.&nbsp; However in today's world of colour
                    inkjet and laser printers, the Z88 has struggled to
                    keep up with technology.&nbsp; As more and more
                    printer manufacturers strive to reduce costs by
                    removing components, they presume that computer
                    users have a Windows or MAC based operating system
                    which will translate all text into the graphics code
                    for them.&nbsp; As a result many printers no longer
                    support a parallel or serial port (which is required
                    by the Z88) and do not allow text to be sent to the
                    printer direct.</p>
                  <p>If you want to use a parallel printer with the Z88,
                    you will need a serial to parallel converter - we
                    can supply the required leads - see below for
                    details.</p>
                  <p>About the best supported printers are those
                    manufactured by HP and Epson, although you have to
                    be extremely careful about which model you have - a
                    full Epson ESC/P2 or HP PCL-4 control set are
                    required for the Cambridge Computer's Z88 to fully
                    support the printer.&nbsp; About the best inkjet
                    which can be obtained fairly reasonably and is fully
                    compatible with the Z88 for both text and graphics,
                    has to be the Epson 850 or Epson 900
                    printers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
