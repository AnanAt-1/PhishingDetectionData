              Shawshank Redemption</font></b><font size="2"> (1994) is an impressive,
              engrossing piece of film-making from director/screenwriter Frank
              Darabont who adapted horror master Stephen King's 1982 novella <i>Rita
              Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption</i> (first published in <i>Different
              Seasons</i>) for his first feature film. The inspirational, life-affirming
              and uplifting, old-fashioned style Hollywood product (resembling <i>The
              Birdman of Alcatraz (1962)</i> and <a href="cool.html"><i>Cool
              Hand Luke (1967)</i></a>) is a combination prison/dramatic film
              and character study. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The popular film is abetted by the golden
          cinematography of Roger Deakins, a touching score by Thomas Newman,
          and a third imposing character - Maine's oppressive Shawshank State
          Prison (actually the transformed, condemned Mansfield Ohio Correctional
          Institution or State Reformatory).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Posters for the film illustrate the liberating, redemptive
            power of hope and the religious themes of freedom and resurrection,
            with the words:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">&quot;Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you
            free.&quot; </font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Darabont's film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale
          (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstaking, persistent
          chess game) of friendship, patience, hope, survival, emancipation,
          and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including
            Best Picture, Best Actor (Morgan Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay,
            Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best
            Sound - but it failed to win a single Oscar. And the film's director
            failed to receive a nomination for himself! In the same year as <i>Forrest
            Gump</i>, <i><a href="pulp.html">Pulp Fiction</a></i>, and <i>Speed</i>,
            they received all of the attention. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Only through positive word-of-mouth
          (following cable TV and broadcast airings, and then video releases)
          did the film do well - although its original reception at the box-office
          was lukewarm. The film was the precursor for another inspirational
          and popular film (and a similar adaptation of a Stephen King story
          by writer/director Frank Darabont) - <i>The Green Mile (1999)</i>.</font></p>
        <font color="#666666" size="4"><strong>Plot Synopsis</strong></font>
        <hr align="left" width="95%" size="1" />
        <p><font size="2">In the prologue before the film begins and pre-title
            credits play, a scratchy car radio (on the soundtrack) plays the
            romantic song: &quot;If I Didn't Care,&quot; 
          performed by the Inkspots:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">If I didn't care, more than words can say,<br />
            If I didn't care, would I feel this way,<br />
            If this isn't love, then why do I thrill<br />
            And what makes my head go round and round<br />
            While my heart stands still...</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">To economically compress events during the credits
            sequence, a scene outside a cabin is intercut with a courtroom trial
            scene. [The year is 1946.] A Plymouth is parked outside a cabin [belonging
            to a golf pro engaged in an affair with an adulterous wife]. During
            a dark, quiet night in the wooded area near the cabin, the driver
            (the woman's husband) reaches for his oily, rag-wrapped gun in the
            glove compartment where bullets are also concealed. To fortify himself,
            he takes a swig of Rosewood bourbon from a glass bottle held in his
            lap. In the courtroom, the driver is identified as Andy Dufresne
            (Tim Robbins). He is interrogated by the D.A. (Jeffrey DeMunn) and
            charged with murder: &quot;Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation
            you had with your wife the night that she was murdered.&quot; The
            well-dressed, mild-mannered defendant calmly speaks: 
          &quot;It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated
          all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno...I
          told her I would not grant one.&quot; The D.A. rephrases Andy's response
          with his actual words:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">'I'll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno.'
              Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony
              of your neighbors.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Obviously, Andy's wife (Renee Blaine) was having an
            affair with Glenn Quentin (Scott Mann), the golf pro at the Snowdon
            Hills Country Club. According to Andy, he felt confused and drunk,
            loaded his gun with bullets and intended to commit the crime, but
            then after quickly &quot;sobering up,&quot; he had second thoughts.
            On his way home, according to his testimony, he discarded his gun: &quot;...I
            stopped and I threw my gun into the Royal River.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The next morning, the bullet-riddled bodies of Andy's
            wife and her lover - in bed - were discovered. Andy's &quot;very
            convenient&quot; (acc. to the DA) testimony and unbelievable profession
            of innocence, coupled with the fact that &quot;the police dragged
            that river for three days and nary a gun was found,&quot; seem rather
            suspicious to the D.A. The water washed away all evidence of his
            alleged innocence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The D.A.'s closing summary to the jury, illustrated
            with a brief flashback-montage of the adulterous couple's passionate
            lovemaking (and obvious 'sin'), also points to Andy's undeniable
            guilt [it looks quite likely that Andy <i>is</i> guilty of the crime,
            although he has trouble remembering]:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We
              have footprints, tire tracks. We have bullets strewn on the ground
              which bear his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise
              with fingerprints. And most of all, we have a beautiful young woman
              and her lover lying dead in each other's arms. They had sinned.
              But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence?...A
              revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit that this was not
              a hot-blooded crime of passion. That, at least, could be understood
              if not condoned. No - this was revenge of a much more brutal and
              cold blooded nature. Consider this. Four bullets per victim. Not
              six shots fired but eight. That means that he fired the gun empty
              and then stopped to reload so that he could shoot each of them
              again. An extra bullet per lover, right in the head.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">The &quot;icy and remorseless&quot; man is sentenced
            by the Maine judge (John Horton) to &quot;serve two life sentences
            back to back - one for each of your victims.&quot; 
          The gavel marking the sentence pounds the screen to black.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The next scene, another scene of judgment, commences
            with noisy, iron bars sliding open, and another door opening into
            a room where five men sit at a table. An unexpected scene, this is
            the parole hearings room of maximum-security Shawshank Prison, where
            a black prisoner/lifer (#30265) named Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; 
          Redding (Morgan Freeman) - the real hero of the story, after serving
          twenty years of his sentence, receives his cursory annual review [in
          the year 1947]. </font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">[Note: The entire film is basically told from Red's
              perspective, and much of the film is centered around the theme
              of observation, perception and seeing - especially Red's observation
              of the other main protagonist, Andy Dufresne.]</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Red religiously vows his rehabilitation has been accomplished
            - and swears - &quot;that's the God's honest truth&quot;:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Reviewer: You feel you've been rehabilitated?<br />
            Red: Oh, yes sir. Absolutely, sir. Yeah, I've learned my lesson.
                I can honestly say that I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a danger
                to society. That's the God's honest truth.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">A mechanical stamp marks &quot;REJECTED&quot; in red
            ink on his parole records. [Note: The picture in his parole document
            is that of Morgan Freeman's own son, Alfonso.] In the prison's exercise
            yard following the &quot;same ol' s--t&quot; review, Red begins his
            ubiquitous voice-over narration (of his recollections) - a world-weary,
            resonant voice-over that continues for the remainder of the film.
            He is the prison's respected retriever - who sneakily passes contraband
            from hand to hand:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">There must be a con like me in every prison in America.
              I'm the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer
              if that's your thing, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's
              high school graduation, damn near anything within reason. Yes sir,
              I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Prison sirens blast as a ritualistic prison event is
            heralded - the arrival of fresh, new prisoners (termed &quot;fresh
            fish&quot;) in a drab-gray school bus. Red recollects back: &quot;So
            when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita
            Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him - 'No problem.'&quot; 
          A well-orchestrated, helicopter/aerial shot, one of the most acclaimed
          shots in the film, moves up from the arriving bus, ascends the main
          tower of the gothic prison, and peers down into the prison courtyard
          where ant-like prisoners scurry toward the fenced-in arrival area to
          gawk, size up, and jeer the new arrivals during their disembarkment:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering
              his wife and the fella she was bangin'. On the outside, he'd been
              vice-president of a large Portland bank. Good work for a man as
              young as he was.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Andy, dressed conspicuously in his banker's suit, is
            seated in the back of the bus. As the bus turns the corner into the
            prison, there are five blue-uniformed guards waiting there - the
            chief captain of the guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) motions the
            bus into position. Chained together, the prisoners exit from the
            bus, walk in single-file, and are lined up for inspection. Andy appears
            tormented and terrified as he nervously walks into his new surroundings
            while surrounded by shouting, taunting spectators who shake the fence.
            The old-timer inmates bet &quot;smokes&quot; on the new 'horses'
            and who will break first - Floyd (Brian Libby) bets on &quot;that
            little sack of s--t...eighth from the front, he'll be first.&quot; Heywood
            (Bill Sadler) chooses &quot;that chubby fat-ass there, the fifth
            one from the front.&quot; Red votes for the fragile-looking Andy
            (&quot;that tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass&quot; -
            a veiled reference to Andy's upcoming rape) at the end of the line:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy first time
              I laid eyes on him. Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.
              That was my first impression of the man.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Andy glances up at the imposing walls above him - walls
            that will close in on his life during two consecutive life sentences
            - as he is marched in. In an admitting area, the prisoners meet Mr.
            Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), the self-righteous, Bible-carrying Warden:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">You are convicted felons. That's why they sent you
              to me. Rule Number One: No blasphemy. I'll not have the Lord's
              name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you'll figure
              out as you go along.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Hadley cusses right into the face of a disrespectful
            prisoner who has asked: 
          &quot;When do we eat?&quot; The guard inhumanely jabs his baton into
          the gut of the man (&quot;you maggot-dick motherf--ker!&quot;). The
          Warden finishes his short, pompous introduction - with another reference
          to anal rape!:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2"> I believe in two things - discipline and the Bible.
              Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord. Your ass
              belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">To remove all vestiges of their identity (or contamination)
            from the outer world, the new cons are made to undress, then hosed
            down in a steel cage with high pressure water spray, and deloused
            with scoops of white delousing powder. As part of their degrading
            processing, they are given prison clothes and a Bible, and marched
            exposed and naked to their individual cells, their new homes in the
            cellblock - a three-tiered structure of concrete and steel.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it.
              They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning
              and half blind from that delousing s--t they throw on you, and
              when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's
              when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of
              an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about
              it. Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody
              always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question
              is, who's it gonna be? It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I
              guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne. I remember my first night.
              Seems like a <i>long</i> time ago.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">As part of their entertaining betting game, the inmates
            taunt and 'bait' the &quot;fishees&quot; or first-timers - and &quot;they
            don't quit till they reel someone in.&quot; The one nicknamed 'Fat-Ass'
            (Frank Medrano) is mercilessly teased by a leering Heywood: &quot;This
            place ain't so bad. Tell ya what. I'll introduce ya around. Make
            you feel right at home. I know a couple of big ol' bull queers that'd
            just <i>love</i> to make your acquaintance, especially that big white
            mushy butt of yours.&quot; When the squeamish, hyperventilating victim
            wails and pleads despairingly: &quot;Oh God! I don't belong here!
            I wanna go home,&quot; the prisoners chant: &quot;Fresh fish!&quot; The
            oppressed 'Fat-Ass' blubbers his unheard complaints to Hadley and
            is beaten with an unceasing rain of baton blows and kicked in the
            face until he lies still on the cold floor. The captain of the guard
            commands his lackeys: &quot;Call the trustees. Take that tub of s--t
            down to the infirmary.&quot; 
          Red loses his cigarette bet to Heywood:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost
              me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">The next morning after a head-count in front of their
            individual cells in the cellblock, the prisoners are marched to the
            mess hall for breakfast. As Andy moves through the room, one of the
            'bull queer' inmates named Bogs Diamond (Mark Rolston) gives him
            a salacious glance. As he begins eating a scoop of oatmeal on his
            metal tray, Andy picks out a squirming white maggot with his fingers.
            A neighboring, elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) inquires: 
          &quot;Are-are you going to eat that?&quot; With everyone expecting
          that Brooks will eat the wiggling creature, he instead offers the &quot;nice
          and ripe&quot; maggot to a baby crow (named Jake) nestled in the inside
          pocket of his droopy blue sweater - he is its caretaker (in its prison
          cage) until it matures and flies away to freedom: &quot;Fell out of
          his nest over by the plate shop. I'm gonna look after him until he's
          big enough to fly.&quot; [Brooks with his pet crow brings to mind the
          film: <i>The Birdman of Alcatraz (1962)</i>.]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Heywood gleefully gloats about winning the bet and
            collects cigarettes as payment from everyone: &quot;I want 'em all
            lined up just like a pretty little chorus line.&quot; But his victory
            is won with a deadly toll and price for 'Fat-Ass' - &quot;Dead. Hadley
            busted his head up pretty good. Doc had already gone home for the
            night. Poor bastard laid there till this morning. By then, hell,
            there was nothing we could do.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"> In the communal shower room,
          Bogs - one of the prison's notorious Sisters (the prison's resident
          rapists), expresses a liking for Andy and asks him a leading question:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Hey, anybody come at you yet? Anybody get to you
              yet? Hey, we all need friends in here. I could be a friend to you.
              (Andy breaks away without responding) Hey, hard to get. I like
              that.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Andy's assigned job is to work in the prison laundry
            room, where he &quot;kept pretty much to himself at first. I guess
            he had a lot on his mind, trying to adapt to life on the inside.
            It wasn't until a month went by that he finally opened his mouth
            to say more than two words to somebody.&quot; While Red plays catch
            in the prison yard, Andy (joking that he's &quot;the wife-killing
            banker&quot;) ambles over to break the month-long silence:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Red: Why'd you do it?<br />
            Andy: I didn't, since you ask.<br />
            Red: (chuckling) You're gonna fit right in. Everybody in (here) is
            innocent. Didn't you know that?...Rumor has it you're a real cold
            fish. You think your s--t smells sweeter than most. Is that right?<br />
            Andy: What do you think?<br />
            Red: I'll tell ya the truth. I haven't made up my mind.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Having learned that Red &quot;knows how to get things,&quot; Andy
            officially meets Red when he makes a simple request for a rock-hammer
            - to resume his geologic 
          &quot;rock-hound&quot; hobby from his &quot;old life,&quot; although
          Red questions whether the tool will be used instead for self-protection
          against Bogs or for tunneling out of the prison:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Red: I'm known to locate certain things from time
              to time. <br />
            Andy: I wonder if you might get me a rock-hammer.<br />
            Red: ...What is it and why?<br />
            Andy: What do you care?<br />
            Red: What if it was a toothbrush? I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just
            quote a price. But then, a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't
            it?<br />
            Andy: Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about six or seven inches long.
            Looks like a miniature pick-axe.<br />
            Red: Pick-axe?<br />
            Andy: For rocks.<br />
            Red: Rocks. (Andy flips him a sample rock) Quartz?<br />
            Andy: (squatting down and inspecting the ground) Quartz. Here's some
            mica, shale, limestone. <br />
            Red: So?<br />
            Andy: So I'm a rock-hound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like
            to be again, on a limited basis.<br />
            Red: Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.<br />
            Andy: No, sir. I have no enemies here.<br />
            Red: No? Wait a while. Word gets around. The Sisters have taken quite
            a likin' to you, especially Bogs. (Bogs watches Andy from afar)<br />
            Andy: I don't suppose it would help any if I explained to them I'm
            not homosexual.<br />
            Red: Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify.
            Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand. If
            I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.<br />
            Andy: Thanks for the advice.<br />
            Red: That's free. You understand my concern.<br />
            Andy: Well, if there's any trouble, I won't use the rock-hammer.
            OK?<br />
            Red: Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe?
            (Andy laughs, when Red unintentionally guesses his real motive) Did
            I miss something here? What's funny?<br />
            Andy: You'll understand when you see the rock-hammer.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">They decide on a price of $10 (which includes Red's
            normal mark-up percentage of twenty percent) for the &quot;specialty
            item,&quot; and Andy assures Red that if he is caught with it during
            a surprise inspection, he won't mention his procurer's name. Red
            explains the rules of his business (&quot;You mention my name, we'll
            never do business again, not for shoelaces or a stick of gum&quot;)
            and the origin of his nickname 'Red': &quot;Maybe it's because I'm
            Irish.&quot; [This is a deliberate gag - delivered to the film audience!
            After African-American Morgan Freeman was cast to play the role of
            a white Irishman, this line was written to 'explain' Red's origins.]
            As Andy strolls away, Red remarks on his carefree, shielded attitude
            (with an &quot;invisible coat&quot; or Christ-like halo), while admitting
            his own growing affection for Andy:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.
              He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't
              normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a
              care or a worry in the world. Like he had on an invisible coat
              that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be
              fair to say I liked Andy from the start.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Andy's request is smuggled into the prison through
            a load of laundry at the loading dock, passed to Red in his new stack
            of clean sheets and blankets, and then distributed to Andy through
            Brooks, the prison librarian delivering books to each cell. Red is
            convinced that the rock-hammer would be useless in tunneling out: &quot;It
            would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall
            with one of these.&quot; In the prison laundry room during a typical
            day, Andy is summoned to fetch some hexlite from the stock area.
            There in the stockroom, he is assaulted by Bogs Diamond and two other
            predatory men (the Sisters) who taunt him and beat him senseless: &quot;That's
            it. You fight. It's better that way.&quot; According to Red, &quot;prison
            is no fairy-tale world&quot; and the vulnerable newcomer is repeatedly
            subjugated and victimized (and gang-raped?) during his first two
            years - dramatized in a short montage:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Things went on like that for a while. Prison life
              consists of routine, and then more routine. Every so often, Andy
              would show up with fresh bruises. The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes
              he was able to fight 'em off, sometimes not. And that's how it
              went for Andy. That was his routine.</font></p>
