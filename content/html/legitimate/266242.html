I have chosen the name<B>&nbsp;aha</B> for the new system I am implementing
on the <A HREF="f21d.htm">F21 Microprocessor</A>.  Perhaps it should be
called<B>&nbsp;aha Forth</B> because of the holistic approach that uses
hardware and software techniques developed by&nbsp;
<A HREF="people.htm#CM">Charles Moore</A> the inventor of Forth and
he calls this Forth.<P>

The hardware platform, F21, is an unusual microprocessor that uses
a hardware architecture based on the Forth virtual machine.  It is
a Forth machine in silicon that simplifies and matches very well to the
Forth software methods developed by its inventor. The hardware design
goals were to create a chip with a thousand times fewer transistors,
lower power consumption, and production cost than other microprocessors
in the 500 Mhz or higher performance range. It is suitable for low cost
low power embedded applications from toys to high end aerospace applications.
It is optimized for the execution of Forth code, logic, expert systems, real-time,
distributed, and AI applications.  It is also a highly integrated device combining a
CPU, memory interface coprocessor, high speed analog I/O coprocessor, video I/O
coprocessor, high speed serial/network coprocessor and router, real time clock,
interrupt controller, 10 gigahertz timer, and parallel port on a tiny
piece of silicon. Other factors that influence the design of the
software are that F21 is word addressing machine with a 20 bit
data bus and a 21 bit address bus. The hardware has been optimized
for small size, cost, and power consumption, simplicity and speed.
It is also known as a Minimal Instruction Set Computer.<P>

The<B>&nbsp;aha</B> software design is influenced by traditional Forth systems
where Forth provides an integrated operating system.  The<B>&nbsp;aha</B>
system will have a Graphic User Interface, a high speed source code compiler,
a source code debugger/browser, an optimizing compiler/editor, and it
hosts application programs. The software is designed to be close
match to the hardware in a holistic way and optimized for small size,
simplicity and speed like the hardware.<P>

The<B>&nbsp;aha</B> system is heuristic, "involving or serving as an aid to learning,
discovery, or problem-solving by experimental methods and especially
trail-and-error methods". The system is holistic, "relating to or
concerned with wholes or with complete systems rather than with the
analysis of, treatment of, or dissection into parts." <A HREF="#ref1"> (*1)</A>

                              Background</B><P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The<B>&nbsp;aha</B> system is heavily influenced by the software developed
and used by Charles Moore over a period of thirty years.  He has carried
the ideas of empowering a programmer by making all aspects of system and
code design simple understandable and accessible, from the inception of
Forth in the 1960s through his recent work on Forth chips and new Forth
software designs.<P>

Chuck moved from early experimental Forths to the construction of
commercial Forths at Forth Inc. and designed systems that became
the basis of traditional Forth and later the widely used ANS Forth
standard.  The PolyForth system that he worked on there before
leaving to work on Forth chips at Novix was successful as a fast
portable Forth that could provide a stand alone integrated OS
and GUI or run in a foreign OS such as DOS.  The first time I
saw it I was impressed that it loaded so quickly and was surprised
to be told that it was actually compiling 700 KB of object code faster than
many systems would simply load such code.<P>

At Novix Chuck developed cmForth for use on the Forth in hardware
Novix chip.  Chuck said that he had the opportunity to go back and
streamline and simplify some things in designing a system that
fit more closely to the new hardware.  The system was remarkably
small, fast, and simple.  On a floppy disk the system could load
a core and compile a new system in about one rotation of the
floppy.  But he said that he was not very pleased with the very
non portable and overly complex optimization techniques in the
software that were needed to match the Novix chip's ability
to execute certain multiple Forth word instruction sequences
in a single opcode and a single cycle.  The Novix used multiple
busses for the data stack, the return stack, and instruction/data
space and could at times manipulate all three in a single cycle.
The hardware and software caught my attention because it was
faster than Intel's fastest at the time and used one hundred
times fewer transistors. The Novix was optimized for subroutine
calls and returns and manipulation of a data stack. But Chuck wanted
hardware and software that could use a more simple technique for code
generation.  His goal was software that was simpler, clearer and
easier to understand and use.<P>

On the hardware front he moved from a 16 bit design to a 32 bit
design with his ShBoom processor.  And frustrated by the tools
that he had to use that didn't understand his goals or share the
focus of his work he began to develop his own CAD software.  He
also began an experiment in sourceless programming.  His idea
was that the best way to represent his chip was the design of
the chip itself rather than an abstracted text description of
the chip.  He extended this idea to the software where he felt
that he the best representation of the code was the code itself
not an abstracted text description of the code.  As he often
put it in those days, "The map is not the territory."<P>

He built an operating system that he first called<B>&nbsp;Three Forth</B>,
as in<B>&nbsp;3/4</B>, because it did not contain all of Forth, it had
no source interpreter or compiler. Later he called it<B>&nbsp;OK</B>,
after the traditional command prompt in Forth systems. <B>&nbsp;OK</B>
is a minimal OS and GUI that uses only a few bytes of structured
menu code for each graphic screen.  The complete system consisted
of the boot code, the menus and graphic screens, a HEX memory
editor, a graphics screen editor, a character set editor, and
an code editor and decompiler.<B>&nbsp;OK</B> was implemented
on the Novix, the ShBoom, an Apple IIc, 386, 486, MuP21, and
Pentium machines all with the same design and without any
source code.  He would begin in a debugger and build the<B>&nbsp;OK</B>
tools needed to construct the rest of the<B>&nbsp;OK</B> system.  Since
the total code involved was only a few K on each system it was
not a large task and he made small improvements to the design in
each iteration.<P>

But<B>&nbsp;OK</B> was just the platform for the application which was
his CAD system which he has used exclusively for a dozen years
for chip design.  He called the system <B>&nbsp;OKAD</B>, pronounced
Oh-CAD.  Using <B>&nbsp;OK</B>, as it does,<B>&nbsp;OKAD</B> is organized into menus with
associated graphic screens for the functions of layout browsing,
layout editing, design rule checks, simulation, format conversion,
and other functions.  In this same period Chuck moved from
designing for Programmable Gate Arrays to designing for custom
Very Large Scale Integration.  He moved from using conventional
tools that were not designed for laying out highly tuned
microprocessors to tools designed to do just what he needed
to improve his productivity. He moved from designing for PGA to
designing custom VLSI to, as he put it, take advantage of the
potential for a ten to one hundred fold improvement in performance
and at the same time a one hundred fold reduction in manufacture
cost.<P>

The sourceless programming approach was a controversial idea and
raised as many questions as did his experiments in using various custom
chorded keyboards in his effort to improve the efficiency of his
use of his menu based software.  After years of use he abandoned
the sourceless programming experiment.  He declared that it had
problems with ambiguous object code sequences that could have
been decompiled in different ways and that the decompiler was
not altogether satisfactory. He said, "One comment about the ambiguity of
decompile: My biggest problem was the lack of expressions that evaluate
and document literals. Comments don't help, because you can't rely on
their accuracy."<P>

He created assembler source code
to the<B>&nbsp;OK</B> and<B>&nbsp;OKAD</B> system to facilitate porting.  He declared
that most importantly he had come to need to have the ability
to compile and interpret code when he needed to create reusable
test scripts and automate testing designs in the <B>&nbsp;OKAD</B>
chip simulator. In short, once again he needed Forth.<P>

In this period his chip designs evolved and so did his idea
of how Forth should be done on these chips.  His chips had
gone to using small opcodes where multiple opcodes could
be packed into a memory word to allow the CPU to clock
instructions at some multiple of the memory clock.  The
choice of opcodes and other architectural details evolved
though years of designs and simulations of various options
and simulations of their effect on compiler design and
application performance.<P>

He came to call his simple optimizing native code Forth compiler
for his chips <B>&nbsp;Machine Forth</B>.  Machine Forth is characterized
by a very close match to the hardware and another round of
streamlining of the compiler internals.  Chuck was pleased by
Machine Forth and it was popular with the programmers who have
used it for the last eight years.  Most versions were simple
ports of the page of code he wrote as the first cross compiler
for MuP21 but there have also been stand alone and embedded versions.<P>

When he embedded a Forth into his<B>&nbsp;OKAD</B> system he made
another set of changes to the internals of the compiler and to
the user interface.  He called this system
&nbsp;<B><FONT COLOR=RED> Color</FONT></B><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN> Forth</FONT></B>.
He said that the definition of
&nbsp;<B><FONT COLOR=RED> Color</FONT></B><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN> Forth</FONT></B>
was putting information into the white space of your source code.  He
said that when he says "color" he means visually distinctive.  He choose
to use color tokens that change the visual appearance of following
Forth words to make them visually distictive to the programmer and to
direct the compiler to do the appropriate thing with them.<P>

Traditionally Forth was a language with almost no syntax, simply
words and spaces.  Chuck was now using different kinds of spaces
to separate words to change the appearance of source code, to
reduce the number of Forth words, and to simplify and speed up
the internals of the Forth system.  He could use color tokens
to inform the compiler what to do with the following words
and was able to make the compiler faster than it would be if
he had used traditional techniques.  He had fewer words in the
dictionary to search during compilation and did not have to
search the dictionary for numbers or convert them from string
to binary representation at compile time.<P>

Since a different part of the brain is used in the perception of
visual differences like color than syntactic differences in a
stream of symbols the approach offered the potential of changing
the focus of the user in reading, writing, editing and understanding
source code.  The idea was seen as very controversial by many
people many of whom would complain that they were color blind
and would not be able to use his system.  He would always reply
that they could display the effect of his tokens on source text
in a way that would make them visually distinctive to them by
using layout on the page, different fonts, different font
attributes or whatever they could see.  He would always remind
these people that in this context "color" means visually
distinctive.<P>

It seems that the idea of merging Forth source code with HTML
tags, which include color tags, to make sources more clear,
more attractive, and in a form that has become a defacto standard
for documentation has a lot in common with what Chuck is doing
but is not seen as a controversial idea.  Perhaps some of this
is that Chuck does not feel compelled to follow standards based
on what he was doing twenty years ago and has always shown
a tendency to try new things and to experiment with new ideas.
Perhaps some of this is that when Chuck says that these new
techniques allow him to do things that are simpler, faster and
more clear that people infer that this means that what they
are doing is more complex, slower, and less clear, and find
the idea controversial.<P>

The details of the internals of his
<B><FONT COLOR=RED> Color</FONT></B><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN> Forth</FONT></B>
have changed and continue to evolve.  He began by simply using text
in his<B>&nbsp;OKAD</B> character set packed into memory words for
improved access by his word addressing hardware designs.  He went
into some detail in his
<A HREF="fsc99.htm">1999 Fireside chat</A> to the Silicon Valley
chapter of the Forth Interest Group about the internals of his
<B><FONT COLOR=RED> Color</FONT></B><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN> Forth</FONT></B>.
In July of 2000 he detailed his most recent changes to the design
including Huffman encoded character packaging in addition to the color
change tokens in his source code in his
<B><FONT COLOR=RED> Color</FONT></B><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN> Forth</FONT></B>
<B><FONT COLOR=BLUE> 2000</FONT></B> presentation to SVFIG.<P>

Chuck's software ideas were so closely matched to the hardware that he has
designed, including the UltraTechnology F21, that I decided to adapt
some of his ideas into a project I had been working on to embed a
compiler into the GUI demonstration software that I had done in
the&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="scope.htm">F21 in a mouse</A> demo.  I have chosen an odd
collection of ideas for <B>&nbsp;aha</B> which brings me to the design
tradeoff details.<P>

In this phase of the design I have not decided exactly how the
editor should look to a user. In this system one could
have multiple editors that present the source code with different
looks.  It could look like traditional Forth with certain tokens
being displayed as tradition Forth words, it could look like
Chuck's<B>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR=RED> Color</FONT></B><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN> Forth</FONT></B>
or whatever else I decide it should look like.<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>
                         aha Implementation Details</B><P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>
The design goals of compact source representation and fast compilation
made me reject ANS Forth mandated 20 bit characters <A HREF="#r2">&nbsp;(*2)</A>  and the byte oriented
ASCII string representation of source that I have been using for target
compilation.  Instead I selected a representation using several types
of records to maximize compilation speed and minimize storage costs.
There is no requirement here that the source code be in a format
that you can process with the editor that you are already using
because you are not already using an editor on this machine.  The
source will not have to be in a format understood by Wordpad or
Emacs because those things don't exist in this environment.
Utility programs can translate and import or export source code in
ASCII byte oriented string format or in HTML or other formats.<P>

Sourceless programming has the minimal source, none.  But it has the
drawback that it cannot be decompiled unambiguously even in this
architecture.  An ideal representation must have clear word names,
clear high level constructs and comments. Sourceless programming
was rejected as the total solution but the technique was borrowed
and used as part of the<B>&nbsp;aha</B> design.<P>

In<B>&nbsp;aha</B> the source code will be created and packaged by the
editor. It will present and process nicely formatted clear
source code.  It will make compiler optimization decisions at edit
time and enforce certain things that I consider good style in the
process.  It will process the source code in records and package it
into one of several types of record containers.<P>

Much of the source can compile into unambiguous packed Forth opcodes. For this
code the binary opcodes are an excellent internal representation of source.
The machine has Forth opcodes that directly correspond to the most
frequently used Forth words.  For sequences where no ambiguity in
decompilation exists they are a very compact representation of these
Forth words, requiring only five bits per Forth word.  The editor
will determine which sequences can be safely represented in this
way.  It is a representation that is about six times more dense
than an ASCII representation of the source words.  In addition to
being a very dense representation of some of the source code it also
provides a mechanism that allows these records to simply be moved
into the object code being compiled.  Much of the code can be
stored in this fashion without giving up anything. The editor
can present this code to a user in symbolic format and the user
need not know how the editor stores packs it into the source.  Nothing is
lost and this code can be converted from source format to part
of executable objects at speeds from ten million to one hundred
million Forth words per second by F21. The idea here is to use
the five bit opcodes as tokens in packed opcode token records to represent
some of the sybolic source code.  It provides a high degree of source
compression and blinding compilation speed for much of the <B>&nbsp;aha</B>
code.<P>

A second type of record will be tokens to represent another list of
other Forth words. This record type will distinguish these tokens from
opcode tokenized sequences.  This provides a dense representation
of source code that would otherwise generate ambiguous opcode sequences at
compile time and that could not be decompiled back into original source code.
This provides a dense representation that can be processed at high speed at
compile time.  This provides a mechanism for code that requires localization
and binding with addresses at compile time.  These tokens will include
the common Forth words that are not opcodes on the machine, ones that
act as macros or compiler directives.  These tokens will include the
kind of tokens that Chuck has implemented in his
<B><FONT COLOR=RED> Color</FONT></B><B><FONT COLOR=GREEN> Forth</FONT></B>
that allow the compiler to do things more quickly than traditional Forth
compilers. It is the responsibility of an editor program to give them
some visual representation.  Some will be tranditional Forth immediate
words. Some will be newer style compiler directives.<P>

Traditional Forth compilers must parse source code byte by byte while
<B>&nbsp;aha</B> will not have to parse opcode tokens or functional tokens
at all. The opcode tokens need only be moved by the compiler and the
functional tokens can operate with a simple shift out and indexed
jump table mechanism.  The dense representation of these tokens, the
count fields, and the simple execution mechanism will make <B>&nbsp;aha</B>
compile faster than systems that must parse source code for every
word and match every word to a dictionary at compile time.<P>

The use of records allows numbers to be represented in binary form
with a token to represent the number base in which they should be displayed
in the editor.  The traditional Forth compilation and interpretation
technique of first parsing a number in string format in the source
then searching the dictionary for it and upon failure to find it
as a defined word attempt to convert it from string format to binary
format at compile time is thus eliminated. The edit of a number
field is done at edit time and certain errors can be caught at
edit time instead of slipping through to compile or run time.<P>

A third type of record will be packed counted strings. These records will
contain the names of defined words, comments, and string data.  Because
they will use a counted and packed representation the string data
they will be faster to process than a simple sequential character
string representation. The compiler will be able to jump over comment
records and pick up names or hashed representations of names more
efficiently with the word addressing CPU instructions. The name
dictionary can be built into the source code at edit time. Defined
names have Code Field Address fields which are initialized to zero
at edit time.<P>

A fourth type of record is the defined name string pointer record.
These records represent defined words in one cell or less and
point to the CFA field in the dictionary.  At compile time the
CFA field is set and the compiler need only follow the CFA pointer
to CFA, combine it with a subroutine call opcode and compile it.<P>

A fifth type of record will be binary data records.  These records
can contain arbitrary binary data including bitmaps and run length
compressed bitmaps.  The record header can distinguish run length
compressed representation which will allow faster processing of
the data because fewer memory operations will be involved and
memory operations are much slower than opcodes on this machine.<P>

The first component to be constructed will be the compiler.
The compiler will read source records and distinguish and process
each record type and Forth word properly. The opcode tokens need
not be compiled in a tradional sense at compile time, the functional
tokes need not be parsed as strings or looked up in a dictionary
only branching opcodes need be compiled and only defined words
need be looked up in the dictionary to be compiled.  The dictionary
does not have to be built at compile time.  All of these things
simplify the <B>&nbsp;aha</B> compiler.<P>

The compiler will not need to write source code records but it,
or another utility program, could compress the source data further after,
or in the processor of, the complete compilation of executable code. The
compiler will first be created by a Machine Forth target compiler on
another machine. It can then process source code, including its own
source to produce new executable object code.

The second component is the source code to be processed by the compiler
to build the component programs in the <B>&nbsp;aha</B> system.<P>

The third component, the editor/optimizing-pre-compiler will need to be
able to read and write source code records.  It must include the functions
of the Machine Forth compiler and be able to recognize and convert opcode
and functional tokens.  They are presented to the user in symbolic source form.
Defined words have names and comments in packed counted string records.
Controled changes to the symbolic source generate the changes to the
record database, certain compiler optimizations and error processing
can be done at edit time.<P>

The fourth component is an source-code-browser/debugger/editor/optimizing-compiler.
It will need to be able to read and write source code records, generate executable
object code using the compiler, and link the source to executable objects. The source
records could be compressed further since they would not have to contain
redundant copies of the opcode tokenized records that were moved into the
compiled executable object code.  Only a few new links between source and
object code are needed to support source level debugging.<P>

Compiled programs will be able to use standard and custom source
record formats to store information.
The system will not be designed to prevent a user from modifying code that
might result in a system crash.  However any source information and
compiled code can be protected by removing records or restricting access
by the sourc-code-browswer.  For some applications privaleged access
could easily be controled by the tools.<P>

Should modifying and recompiling component source code cause a system failure
the system can be rebooted manually or in some cases could be rebooted
by a watchdog interupt driven routine.  Since
the original unmodified source code and compiler can be loaded from
ROM or FLASH in a fraction of a second it should not represent a serious
problem.  If modified code contains new bugs after an edit and is saved
back to FLASH without testing locating the bug then the system may
fail upon an attempted reboot and would require the replacement of a
back up copy of the ROM or FLASH with the original system or from
a reduntant copy on the device if possible.<P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>
                        Implementation Progress</B><P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>
As of 11/23/00 this design document, a few dcode snippets, and the
F21 machine code compiler that will become part of the
editor/optimizing-pre-compiler are the only parts of <B>&nbsp;aha</B> implementation
that have been completed.<P>

I got Chuck's first impression of the design on 11/27/00.  He said, "<B>Aha</B>
sounds great. Your history of OKAD tells it well. I've considered a token
providing a binary array, but haven't provided it yet." He also offered
the comment quoted above about the ambiguity of decompile.<P>

As of 11/27/00 I have designed the compiler code to process opcode token and
binary data token records, compressed opcode token and binary token records,
and functional token records.  I am working on the design of the code that
will manage the dictionary for the packed counted string records.
I wrote some test code to compile opcode tokenized records, binary data
records, and run length compressed opcode and binary records. This
took only a few lines of code.<P>

I have decided that <B>&nbsp;aha</B> could
be inmplemented only with packed counted string and string pointer
records.  Such an implementation would be close to a traditional simple
byte oriented ASCII string representation of source.  However a linked
dictionary of defined names created at edit time can be used to compress
the representation of these names to a pointer to the packed counted string
record/CFA record in the name dictionary in the source code. Only one copy
of each string will exist in <B>&nbsp;aha</B> and subsequent occurances
of defined words are stored as string pointer tokens.<P>

The branching instructions operate efficiently to a 16K word home page
in DRAM or SRAM (on F21d) and within the current 16K word page.  Branches
outside of this range require a longer macro sequence.  The use
of a twenty bit word pointer would support images up to a megaword in the
compiler.  If the number of defined words is given a specific limit an
indexed address table could be used to represent defined words in as
little as ten bit pointers. ASCII representation of source requires several
characters and a space for the typical word so representing a Forth
source name as a single cell or less is a more compact representation
of the source, allows more error checking at edit time,
and does not require a dictionary lookup at compile time.<P>

The CFA in each record of the name dictionary in the source code
are initialized to zero.  The compiler sets the address in the CFA field
when the name is defined and all references to the word appear as pointers
to the CFA field.  The compilation of a named word only requires
following the string pointer token to the CFA of the named word then fetching
it and compiling it to the appropriate form of subroutine call or jump
instruction. No dictionary search is needed to interpret or compile a
defined word in this represetnation. Inlining sequences could be supported as
an option to the default function of simple compile CFA to subroutine call
instruction. The dictionary exists at compile time and need only be
instantiated with the compile address of each defined word at compile time.<P>

Dictionary searches occur only at edit time when words being defined are
stored in dictionary records or when byte oriented ASCII source code is
tokenized by an application program.  At the pre-process time, or edit
time, words entered by the user or words processed from a file are parsed
and tokenized as either opcode tokens, function tokens, defined word
tokens, data tokens, or comments.  It could be translated back to ASCII
format with no loss.  In <B>&nbsp;aha</B> no dictionary searchs are needed at
compile time, opcode tokens are simply moved, function tokens are invoked
from a table, words being defined have their CFA set, and defined
word pointer tokens are used to simply fetch a CFA and compile a subroutine
call.<P>
