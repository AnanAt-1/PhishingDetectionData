"Thus  on  Earth's  little  ball  to  the  birds  you  owe  all,  yet 
your  gratitude's  small  for  the  favours  they've  done. 
And  their  feathers  you  pill,  and  you  eat  them  at  will,  yes, 

you  plunder  and  kill  the  bright  birds  one  by  one  ; 
There's  a  price  on  their  head,  and  the  Dodo  is  dead,  and 
the  Moa  has  fled  from  the  face  of  the  sun  !  " 

Andrew  Lang. 


And  the  birds  sang  round  him,  o'er  him, 

"  Do  not  shoot  us,  Hiawatha  !  " 

Sang  the  Opechee,  the  Robin, 

Sang  the  Bluebird,  the  Owaissa, 

"  Do  not  shoot  us,  Hiawatha  1 " 

Longfellow.

LIST   OF  PLATES. 


Much  of  the  technical  excellence  of  these  plates  is  due  to  the  fine  specimens  of  birds 
furnished  the  artist  through  the  courtesy  of  the  American  Museum  of  Natural  History, 
New  York  City.  In  this  connection  both  illustrator  and  author  wish  to  thank  Dr. 
J.  A.  Allen  and  Mr.  Frank  M.  Chapman  of  the  department  of  ornithology  in  that 
institution. 

The  numerals  on  the  plates  indicate  the  approximate  length  of  each  bird,  small  frac- 
tions being  avoided.  The  point  of  measurement  being  from  the  tip  of  beak  over  the 
back  to  the  end  of  the  tail,  it  must  be  remembered  that  this  length  is  often  variable 
according  to  the  development  of  the  tail.

TO  THE  READER. 


Do  you  want  to  know  the  birds  and  call  them  by  their 
familiar  names  ?  You  may  do  so  if  you  will,  provided  you 
have  keen  eyes  and  a  pocket  full  of  patience;  patience  is 
the  salt  of  the  bird-catching  legend. 

The  flowers  silently  aivait  your  coming,  from  the  wayside 
wild  rose  to  the  shy  orchid  entrenched  in  the  depths  of  the 
cool  bog,  and  you  may  examine  and  study  them  at  your 
leisure.  With  the  birds  it  is  often  only  a  luring  call,  a 
scrap  of  melody,  and  they  are  gone.  Yet  in  spite  of  this 
you  may  have  a  bowing  and  even  a  speaking  acquaintance 
with  them. 

The  way  is  plain  for  those  who  wish  to  study  the  science 
of  ornithology  and  have  time  to  devote  to  the  pursuit;  its 
literature  is  exhaustive,  and  no  country  offers  a  more  inter- 
esting variety  of  species  than  our  own.  But  for  the  novice, 
who  wishes  to  identify  easily  the  birds  that  surround  him, 
to  recognize  their  songs  and  give  them  their  English  names, 
the  work  at  first  seems  difficult.  There  are  many  scien- 
tific terms,  containing  their  own  definitions,  that  lose  force 
and  exactness  when  translated  into  simpler  language,  requir- 
ing a  dozen  words  to  give  the  meaning  of  one.  There  is  a 
comforting  fact,  however,  for  the  novice,  that  while  scientific 
nomenclature  has  been  and  is  constantly  changing,  the  com- 
mon names,  that  science  also  recognizes,  remain  practically 
unchanged.  Our  Bluebird  bears  the  same  name  as  in  Audu- 
bon's day,  and  the  Meadowlark,  who  has  been  moved  from 

one  genus  to  another,  is  called  the  Meadowlark  still.

TO  THE   HEADER. 

In  speaking  of  the  common  names  of  birds,  I  would  draw 
a  sharp  line  between  the  English  names  recognized  by  the 
text  books  and  the  American  Ornithologists'  Union,  and  the 
purely  local  titles.  Local  names,  whether  of  flowers  or 
birds,  are  often  a  hindrance  to  exact  knowledge,  because 
they  frequently  stand  for  more  than  one  object.  For 
example,  I  have  heard  the  term  Eedbird  applied  alike  to 
the  Baltimore  Oriole,  Scarlet  Tanager,  and  Cardinal ;  but  a 
knowledge  of  the  recognized  common  names  of  a  bird  will 
enable  the  student  to  find  its  species  in  any  of  the  manuals. 

Allowing  that  you  wish  to  name  the  birds,  do  not  be  held 
back  by  minor  considerations.  You  are  not  to  be  excluded 
from  the  pleasures  of  this  acquaintance  even  if  you  are. 
obliged  to  spend  most  of  your  life  in  the  city.  The  bird- 
quest  will  lend  a  new  attraction  to  your  holidays,  and  you 
will  be  led  toward  the  nearest  park  or  along  the  front  of 
river  or  harbour.  Bradford  Torrey  gives,  in  his  inimitablf^ 
way,  an  account  of  the  birds  (some  seventy  species)  which 
he  saw  on  Boston  Common,  and  Frank  M.  Chapman  lists 
one  hundred  and  thirty  odd  species  which  he  has  seen  in 
Central  Park,  New  York.^ 

The  museums  also  are  open  to  you,  and  their  treasury  oi 
skilfully  preserved  birds  offers  the  advantage  of  close 
inspection.  The  taxidermist's  art  has  reached  great  per- 
fection lately,  and  in  the  place  of  bird  mummies,  stuffed  and 
mounted  each  in  the  stiff  attitude  of  its  neighbour,  without 
the  tribal  marks  of  pose  or  expression,  —  as  much  alike  as 
the  f our-and-twenty  blackbirds  that  were  baked  in  the  pie,  — 
we  now  see  the  birds  as  individuals  in  their  homes.  The 
American  Museum  of  Natural  History,  New  York,  has  sixty 
such  bird  groups  which  show  the  Chimney  Swift,  nesting 
on  his  little  bracket,  the  Euffed  Grouse  rustling  through 
the  leaves  with  her  tiny  brown  chicks,  the  Baltimore  Oriole 
and  its  swinging  nest,  or  the  Black  Duck  guarding  its  bed 

1  Mr.  Chapman,  Assistant  Curator  of  the  Department  of  Birds  and  Mam- 
mals of  the  Museum  of  Natural  History,  has  recently  completed  an  excel- 
lent Visitor's  Guide  to  the  Museum's  Collection  of  Birds,  found  within  fifty 
miles  of  New  York  City,  in  which  all  birds  seen  in  Central  Park  are  spe- 
cially noted.

TO  THE  READER. 

of  marsh-grass.  We  Americans  have  not  yet  thoroughly- 
acquired  the  habit  of  regarding  the  museums  as  great 
picture  books,  and  yet  such  they  are,  and  in  this  connection 
I  wish  to  express  my  gratitude  to  Dr.  J.  A.  Allen,  Curator 
of  the  Department  of  Birds  and  Mammals  of  the  American 
Museum  of  Natural  History,  for  much  valuable  assistance 
and  advice  in  connection  with  this  book. 

If  you  are  not  a  dweller  in  a  large  city,  but  live  in  a 
suburban  town  with  a  few  shrubs  in  your  yard  or  a  vine 
over  your  door,  you  have  the  wherewithal  to  entertain  bird 
guests  who  will  talk  to  you  so  cheerily  that  you  will  soon 
be  led  to  discover  that  there  is  a  lane  or  a  bit  of  woods 
within  walking  distance,  where  you  may  hear  more  of  such 
delightful  conversation.  Read  the  "  Bird  Songs  about  Wor- 
cester," ^  by  the  late  Harry  Leverett  Nelson,  a  graphic  as 
well  as  charming  account  of  the  birds  to  be  found  in  the 
neighbourhood  of  a  rural  city,  and  you  will  be  encouraged. 

And  you  who  through  circumstance,  rather  than  choice 
perhaps,  live  in  the  real  country  and,  as  yet,  feel  the  isola- 
tion more  than  the  companionableness  of  Nature,  who  love 
the  flowers  in  a  way,  but  find  them  irresponsive,  I  beg  of 
you  to  join  this  quest.  You  will  discover  that  you  have 
neighbours  enough,  friends  for  all  your  moods,  silent,  melo- 
dious, or  voluble;  friends  who  will  gossip  with  you,  and 
yet  bear  no  idle  tales. 

If  you  wish  to  go  on  this  pleasant  quest,  you  must  take 
with  you  three  things,  —  a  keen  eye,  a  quick  ear,  and  loving 
patience.  The  vision  may  be  supplemented  by  a  good  field- 
glass,  and  the  ear  quickened  by  training,  but  there  is  no 
substitute  for  intelligent  patience.  A  mere  dogged  persist- 
ency will  not  do  for  the  study  of  the  living  bird,  and  it  is 
to  the  living  bird  in  his  love-songs,  his  house-building,  his 
haunts,  and  his  migrations,  that  I  would  lead  you.  The 
gun  that  silences  the  bird  voice,  and  the  looting  of  nests, 
should  be  left  to  the  practised  hand  of  science ;  you  have 
no  excuse  for  taking  life,  whether  actual  or  embryonic,  as

TO  THE   READER. 

your  very  ignorance  will  cause  useless  slaughter,  and  the 
egg-collecting  fever  of  the  average  boy  savours  more  of  the 
greed  of  possession  than  of  ornithological  ardour. 

Finally,  whoever  you  are  who  read  these  pages,  spare  for 
me  a  little  of  your  hoard  of  the  same  patience  with  which 
you  are  to  study  the  birds,  if,  while  striving  to  lead  you 
through  the  wood-path,  I  often  stumble  or  retrace  my  steps.

THE  SPRING  SONG. 

What  tidings  hath  the  Swallow  heard 
That  bids  her  leave  the  lands  of  summer 

For  woods  and  fields  where  April  yields 
Bleak  welcome  to  the  blithe  newcomer  ? — Bourdillow. 

The  trees  are  leafless,  and  there  are  snow  patches  in  nooks 
and  corners ;  the  air  is  laden  with  chilly  gusts,  but  at  noon  a 
little  softness  creeps  into  it;  the  days,  though  gray,  hold 
twelve  hours  of  light,  and  the  vernal  equinox  is  at  hand. 

Come  to  the  window,  my  friend,  you  who  are  going  to 
spend  some  days,  weeks,  or  months  upon  the  bird-quest. 
You  say  that  you  see  nothing  but  the  bare  trees,  not  even 
"the  sun  making  dust  and  the  grass  growing  green,"  like 
sister  Anne  in  the  fairy  tale.  Open  your  window,  or  better 
still,  go  into  the  porch,  for  a  procession  is  soon  to  pass,  and 
you  must  hear  the  music.  Listen !  on  the  branch  of  the  oak 
where  the  leaves  still  cling  is  the  bugler,  the  Song  Sparrow, 
calling  through  the  silence, "  They  come !  They  come !  They 
come !    Prepare  the  way." 

Then  presently,  instead  of  tramping  feet,  you  will  hear 
the  rustling  of  the  innumerable  wings  of  the  bird  army. 
Happy  for  you  if  it  is  a  long  time  in  passing  and  if  a  large 
part  of  it  camps  for  the  season.  Usually  it  sends  forward  a 
few  scouts,  and  then  a  company  or  two,  before  the  brigade, 
clad  in  its  faultless  dress  uniform,  sweeps  on,  singing  the 
greatest  choral  symphony  of  Nature,  —  the  Spring  Song. 

There  are  many  reasons,  both  of  fact  and  of  fancy,  why  it 
is  best  to  begin  the  study  of  birds  in  the  spring.     The 

3 


INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

untrained  eye  becomes  gradually  accustomed  to  its  new 
vocation  before  it  is  overtaxed.  The  matter  of  eyesight  is 
of  the  first  importance  in  the  study  of  the  living  bird.  Is 
your  sight  sufficiently  good  to  allow  you  to  exercise  it  in  this 
way  ?  The  birds  that  you  study  will  not  be  in  the  hand, 
but  in  the  bush. 

You  may  be  accustomed  to  an  out-door  life,  you  may 
comprehend  at  a  glance  all  the  details  of  a  landscape,  or 
be  able  to  detect  a  particular  flower  fields  away;  but  in 
the  quest  of  a  bird  which  is  oftentimes  on  the  wing,  your 
eyes  will  be  obliged  to  distinguish  certain  details  in  a  mov- 
ing object  backgrounded  by  a  dazzling  sky,  and  at  the  next 
moment  refocus,  to  discover  a  bird,  with  perhaps  very  dull 
plumage,  who  is  eluding  you  by  circling  in  the  black  shadows 
of  the  pines.  Thus  you  will  be  either  peering  into  dim 
recesses  or  facing  the  strongest  light  twenty  times  to  a  single 
chance  of  seeing  a  bird  in  a  clear  light,  with  his  plumage 
accentuated  by  a  suitable  background.  If  you  squint  and 
cannot  face  the  sun,  you  must  study  birds  in  the  museums, 
or  learn  to  know  them  by  their  songs  alone;  a  field-glass 
will  lengthen  the  sight,  but  it  will  not  give  the  ability  to 
endure  light. 

Many  people  think  that  a  bird  wears  the  same  plumage 
and  sings  the  same  songs  all  the  year  round,  and  expect  to 
identify  it  by  some  easy  and  inflexible  rule,  which  shall 
apply  to  all  seasons  and  circumstances,  but  this  is  im- 
possible. 

When  the  birds  come  to  us  in  spring  they  wear  their 
perfect  and  typical  plumage  and  are  in  the  best  voice,  as 
befits  those  who  are  going  courting.  The  male  wears  the 
most  showy,  or  at  least  the  most  distinctly  marked  coat,  and 
is  generally  slightly  larger  than  the  female,  except  in  the 
case  of  Owls  and  a  few  others,  where  the  female  is  the 
larger.  In  many  families  there  is  very  little  variation 
between  the  colouring  of  the  male  and  female,  and  at  a  short 
distance  you  would  probably  notice  none,  except  that  the 
female  is  the  paler  of  the  two.  But  sometimes  the  differ- 
ence is  so  marked  that  the  novice  invariably  mistakes  the 

4 


THE  SPRING  SONG. 

female  for  a  bird  of  another  species ;  hence  the  importance 
of  describing  the  plumage  of  both  sexes. 

The  Scarlet  Tanager  has  a  green  mate  (there  is  great  wis- 
dom in  this  —  a  brilliant  brooding  bird  would  betray  the 
location  of  the  nest);  the  female  Hummingbird  lacks  the 
ruby  throat  of  her  spouse ;  and  the  wife  of  the  sleek  black, 
white,  and  buff  Bobolink  wears  sober  brown.  When  the 
birds  arrive  in  the  spring,  these  colour  distinctions  are 
marked ;  but  after  the  nesting  time,  which  occurs  mostly  in 
May  and  June,  a  fresh  complication  arises.  The  young 
birds  on  leaving  the  nest,  though  fully  grown  perhaps  and 
capable  of  strong  flight,  often  wear  hybrid  feathers  in  which 
the  characteristics  of  both  parents  are  mingled.  Soon  after 
this  time  the  summer  moulting  takes  place,  for  the  majority 
of  birds  moult  tmce  a  year.  August  is  the  time  of  this 
moulting.  The  jubilant  love-song  ceases,  and  the  birds, 
dishevelled  and  moping,  keep  well  in  the  shelter  of  the  trees 
or  retreat  to  the  woods,  as  they  are  weakened  and  their 
power  of  flight  is  diminished.  After  the  moulting  comes 
another  disturbing  element,  not  only  for  the  novice,  but  for 
those  well  versed  in  bird  ways ;  with  many  birds  the  colours 
of  the  spring  plumage  are  either  wholly  changed  or  greatly 
modified,  and  though  the  song  may  be  in  a  measure  renewed 
for  a  brief  season,  it  is  infrequent  and  not  always  true.  The 
young  birds  are  now  associating  with  the  old  and  adding 
their  attempts  at  warbling,  so  that  I  think  the  snares  that 
Jie  in  the  way  of  beginning  the  study  of  Song-birds  after 
midsummer  are  quite  evident. 

The  male  Bobolink,  after  moulting,  becomes  brown  like 
the  female ;  the  American  Goldfinch,  a  late  moulter,  turns  a 
dull  olive ;  but  the  Bluebird's  new  feathers  are  rusty ;  many 
Warblers  lose  their  identifying  bands  and  streaks  while  the 
Baltimore  Oriole  keeps  his  flaming  feathers. 

After  this  moulting  the  bird's  life  as  an  individual  ceases 
for  a  season ;  he  is  no  longer  swayed  by  sex,  but  by  the  flock- 
ing impulse  of  self-x3reservation,  and  in  this  case  it  is  not 
always  birds  of  a  feather  that  flock  together. 

In  the  early  spring,  when  the  relaxing  touch  of  the  sun  is 

6 


INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

felt,  the  second  moulting  occurs,  and  the  feathers  that  have 
borne  the  wear  and  tear  of  winter  give  place  to  the  fresh 
new  coat,  and  the  bird  throat  swells  with  the  Spring  Song. 

From  a  residential  standpoint,  we  have  four  distinct 
grades  of  birds  to  consider:  — 

I.  The  summer  residents :  Those  birds  which,  coming  to 
us  in  the  spring,  rear  their  young,  and  after  shifting 
about  somewhat  in  late  summer,  retreat  more  or  less 
southward  for  the  winter. 
II.  The  residents:  Comprising  those  species  which  are 
represented  by  individuals  all  the  year  round. 

III.  The  winter  residents ;  The  birds  who  are  inhabitants  of 
boreal  regions,  breeding  beyond  the  northern  border 
of  the  United  States,  coming  only  to  us  in  winter, 
and  retiring  northward  at  the  time  of  the  general 
upward  migration. 

lY.  The  migrants :  Birds  that  are  with  us  for  a  few  weeks 
in  spring,  en  route  from  the  south  to  their  more 
northern  breeding  haunts,  and  are  also  visible  for  a 
similar  period  during  the  return  trip  in  autumn.  We 
may  class  with  these  the  casual  visitors  that  appear 
for  a  brief  visit  either  summer  or  winter. 

The  two  movements  of  bird  life  in  spring  and  fall  are 
known  as  the  great  migrations,  some  birds  being  plentiful 
in  spring  and  quite  rare  in  the  autumn,  and  vice  versa,  as 
the  path  chosen  for  the  upward  and  downward  trip  may  not 
be  the  same.  The  individuals  belonging  to  these  classes  will 
be  specified  in  turn,  and  they  are  mentioned  here  to  show 
you  that  if  you  do  not  begin  the  bird-quest  in  spring,  in  time 
to  meet  the  army  of  migrants,  you  may  miss  some  of  the 
most  interesting  species. 

Conspicuous  among  the  birds  that  lodge  with  us  in  April 
and  May,  letting  us  hear  their  song  for  a  brief  period,  is  the 
great  Fox  Sparrow,  the  White-throated  and  White-crowned 
Sparrows,  the  group  of  lovely  Warblers,  and,  best  of  all, 
the  Hermit  Thrush,  whose  heavenly  notes  of  invocation,  if 
once  heard,  are  never  forgotten.

THE  SPRING  SONG. 

If  you  are  ready  for  this  quest  when  the  sun  crosses  the 
equinox  the  21.  of  March,  you  will  be  in  good  time,  and 
your  labours  will  be  lightened  by  studying  the  birds  as  they 
come  one  by  one,  hearing  each  voice  in  a  solo,  before  all  have 
gathered  in  late  May  and  individual  notes  blend  in  the 
chorus.  In  this  locality  there  is  very  little  general  upward 
movement  before  the  vernal  equinox,  for  the  weather  is  too 
capricious.  A  few  Song  Sparrows  and  Bluebirds  begin  to 
sing,  but  the  Yellowbirds  that  have  wintered  with  us  are 
still  wearing  their  old  coats,  and  have  not  broken  into  song. 
Last  spring  (1894)  I  noted  in  my  diary  the  return  of  the 
Song  Sparrows  March  5,  but  the  flocks  of  Bluebirds  and 
Kobins  did  not  come  until  the  13.  when  a  flock  of  a  hun- 
dred or  more  Fox  Sparrows  also  arrived,  and  the  White- 
throated  Sparrows  followed  them. 

The  birds  oftentimes  arrive  singly  or  by  twos  or  threes, 
and  then  again  suddenly  in  great  flocks.  One  afternoon 
there  may  not  be  a  White-throat  in  sight,  the  next  morning 
they  will  be  feeding  upon  the  ground  like  a  drift  of  brown 
leaves.  Almost  all  birds  migrate  at  night,  and  every  dawn 
will  show  you  some  new  arrival,  pluming  and  drying  his 
feathers  in  the  first  rays  of  the  sun.  Birds  who  depend 
upon  insect  diet,  like  the  Phoebe,  the  commonest  of  the  fly- 
catchers, may  arrive  too  soon,  before  insect  life  has  quick- 
ened, and  suffer  much  through  their  miscalculation.  Often 
the  appearance  of  individuals  of  a  species  does  not  indicate 
the  beginning  of  the  general  return,  as  they  may  be  birds 
that  have  not  gone  far  away,  but  have  merely  been  roving 
about  all  winter. 

From  the  last  of  March  until  the  first  of  June  the  spring 
migration  is  in  full  swing,  some  of  the  earlier  birds  to  arrive 
will  have  passed  on,  before  the  Tanagers  and  Black-polls, 
and  other  late  Warblers,  appear.  The  last  week  of  May  the 
Spring  Song  is  at  its  height ;  let  us  look  at  the  order  in  which 
the  singers  begin  and  end  their  daily  music. 

You  must  be  up  in  the  long  twilight  that  precedes  dawn, 
if  you  wish  to  hear  the  little  precentor  —  the  Chipping 
Sparrow  —  give  the  signal  on  his  shrill  pitch  pipe.     Then 

7 


INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

the  Song  Sparrow  sounds  his  reveille  of  three  notes  and  a 
roulade  —  *'  Maids,  maids,  maids,  put  your  kettle-ettle  on.'' 
The  Robin  answers  with  his  clarion  notes,  and  the  Bluebird, 
mildly  plaintive,  seems  to  regret  that  the  quiet  night  is 
past,  and  sighs  — "  Dear,  dear,  think  of  it,  think  of  it." 
Then  the  various  Swallows  begin  their  twitterings,  and  the 
Chimney  Swift  redoubles  his  winged  pursuit  of  insects,  and 
the  Purple  Martins,  rising  in  pairs,  coquette  in  mid-air,  and 
their  cheerfid  warble  seems  to  drop  from  the  clouds.  As  it 
becomes  light,  the  Phoebe  joins  his  "Pewit,  phoebe-a,"  with 
the  Wood  Pewee's  —  "Pewee,  pewee  peer,"  and  the  Field 
Sparrow  whistles  and  trills  somewhat  in  the  key  of  the 
Chipping  Sparrow.  Then  up  from  the  meadow  wells  the 
song  of  the  Bobolink,  our  only  bird  that  rivals  the  English 
Lark  in  singing  and  soaring,  pouring  out  its  delicious  melody 
with  virile  fervour,  while  in  the  same  field  the  Meadowlark 
rings  his  bell-like  —  "  Spring  o'  the  year,  spring  o'  the  year  I " 
and  the  Indigo  Bunting  lisps  from  the  briars. 

One  by  one,  the  Oriole,  the  Song  and  Wood  Thrushes,  the 
Mourning  Dove,  Catbird,  Towhee,  Wrens,  Warblers,  Chat, 
and  the  obstreperous  Yireos  chime  in.  These  are  the  birds 
that  you  may  hear  in  your  garden  and  the  near-by  meadows. 
Down  in  the  lowlands  the  Red-winged  Blackbird  "  flutes  his 
okalee,"  the  Crows  keep  up  an  incessant  cawing,  and  in  the 
woods  between  these  lands  and  the  marshes,  the  Herons 
cry;  while  from  the  marshes  themselves  the  Snipe  call. 
The  flocking  Sandpipers  "  peep  "  from  the  beach  edge,  and 
ihe  migrating  Ducks  call  as  they  settle  in  the  flags. 

Above  the  inland  woods  the  Nighthawk,  the  Whip-poor- 
will's  kinsman,  skirling,  circles  a  few  times  before  hiding 
from  day.  There  are  Hawk  cries,  as  Cooper's  Hawk  (the 
dreaded  chicken-killer)  bears  a  tender  morsel  to  her  nest- 
lings already  well  fledged,  who  are  in  the  top  of  the  tall 
hickory,  and  the  Quail  whistles  "  Bob- white !  Poor  Bob- 
white  ! "  the  Buffed  Grouse  clucks  henlike,  and  the  Wood- 
cock calls  like  his  brother  Snipe. 

It  is  in  these  woods,  within  sound  of  running  water,  that 
you  may  hear  the  Veery,  though  he  is  not  so  much  the  bird 

8 


THE  SPRING  SONG. 

of  dawn  as  of  twilight,  and  in  this  same  spot  some  day  the 
Hermit  Thrush  may  give  a  rehearsal  for  your  private  ear,  of 
the  music  with  which  he  will  soon  thrill  the  northern  woods. 

This  is  the  Matin  Song.  When  it  ceases,  you  must  watch 
for  the  individual  birds  as  they  go  to  and  fro,  feeding  or 
building,  or  perching  on  some  favourite  twig  to  sing,  either 
to  their  mates  or  from  pure  exultation.  From  nine  o'clock 
in  the  morning  until  five  in  the  afternoon,  the  principal 
singers  are  the  Bobolink,  Meadowlark,  Vireos;  the  Red- 
start, who  declares  that  every  morsel  he  swallows  is  "  Sweet, 
sweet,  sweeter ! "  the  Black-throated  Green  Warbler,  who 
flashes  his  yellow  feathers  calling,  "  Will  you  co-ome,  will 
you  co-ome,  will  you?"  the  sprightly  Maryland  Yellow- 
throat,  who  almost  beckons  as  he  dashes  about  laughing, 
"  Follow  me,  follow  me  " ;  the  Baltimore  Oriole,  who  alter- 
nately blows  his  mellow  horn  or  complains  querulously ;  and 
the  Song  Sparrow,  who  sings  equally  at  all  times. 

Towards  five  o'clock  the  Evensong  begins,  and  the  Purple 
Finch,  perching  in  the  elm  top,  warbles  in  continuous  bursts 
—  "  List  to  me,  list  to  me,  hear  me,  and  I'll  tell  you,  you, 
you,"  each  peal  being  more  vigorous  than  the  last.  The 
Wood  Thrushes  take  up  their  harp-like  "  Uoli  Uoli-,  aeo- 
lee-lee,"  the  Vesper  Sparrow  tunes,  the  birds  of  morning 
follow,  one  by  one ;  but  there  are  new  voices  that  we  did 
not  hear  in  the  matinal  that  continue  after  the  chorus  is 
hushed  —  the  Eose-breasted  Grosbeak,  the  Yeery,  and  the 
Whip-poor-will. 

The  Yeery  rings  his  echo  notes  in  the  morning  also,  but 
his  evensong  is  the  best ;  and,  as  the  dusk  deepens,  his  notes 
have  a  more  solemn  quality.  The  Grosbeak  has  a  sweet, 
rounded,  warbling  song  that  it  is  difficult  to  render  in  sylla- 
bles intelligently,  but  when  you  hear  it  in  the  twilight  you 
will  know  it,  because  it  is  unlike  anything  else.  The  Mock- 
ingbird is  not  heard  freely  as  a  night  singer  in  this  latitude, 
but  further  south  he  gives  his  best  song  only  to  the  night 
wind;  not  his  mocking,  jeering  ditty  of  squeaks  and  cat- 
calls, but  his  natural  heart-song ;  and  when  you  hear  it,  you 
may  listen  for  the  martial  note  of  the  Cardinal,  who  seems 

9 


INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

to  tell  the  hours,  adding  to  each  —  "  All's  well."  Then  the 
Whip-poor-will  calls,  and  the  Owls  answer,  hooting,  laugh- 
ing, purring,  according  to  the  specific  note. 

When  you  go  through  garden,  lane,  and  wood,  on  your 
happy  quest,  circling  the  marshes  that  will  not  yield  you 
foothold,  remember  that  if  you  wish  to  hear  the  Spring  Song 
and  identify  the  singers,  you  must  yourself  be  in  tune,  and 
you  must  be  alert  in  keeping  the  record,  lest  the  troop  slip 
by  through  the  open  doorway  of  the  trees,  leaving  you  to 
regret  your  carelessness  all  the  year. 

As  you  listen  to  the  song  and  look  at  the  birds,  many  will 
disappear,  and  you  will  know  that  these  are  the  migrants 
who  have  gone  to  their  various  breeding  haunts ;  and  that 
those  who  are  busy  choosing  their  building  sites,  and  are 
carrying  straw,  clay  and  twigs,  are  the  summer  residents. 
Then  you  must  glide  quietly  among  the  trees  to  watch  the 
next  scene  of  the  bird  year  —  the  building  of  the  nest  — 
which  is  the  motive  of  the  Spring  Song,  and  you  will  feel 
that  in  truth  — 

"  Hard  is  the  heart  that  loveth  nought 
In  May."

THE  BUILDING  OF  THE  NEST. 

Know'st  thou  what  wove  yon  woodbird's  nest 

Of  leaves,  and  feathers  from  her  breast  ?  —  Emerson. 

May  and  June  are  the  nesting  months.  Some  impatient 
Bluebirds  and  Robins  begin  in  April,  and  the  lonely  Owls 
and  larger  Hawks  breed  even  in  February  and  March,  while, 
on  the  other  hand,  the  Goldfinches  and  Cedar  Waxwings 
wait  until  July ;  and  other  birds,  who  raise  several  broods 
in  a  season,  like  the  Robins,  Sparrows,  Swallows,  and  Wrens, 
continue  laying  through  July  and  straggle  into  August,  but 
the  universal  song  and  nesting  belong  to  May  and  June. 

In  early  May  the  singing  is  wildly  spontaneous,  the  birds 
are  unguarded  in  their  movements  and  constantly  show 
themselves ;  but  when  they  have  mated,  a  sense  of  responsi- 
bility comes  over  the  gay  minstrels,  and  they  become  more 
wary.  The  soberly  clad  wife  cautions  secrecy ;  there  is  so 
much  to  discuss  that  must  be  whispered  only  in  the  echo- 
less  depths  of  the  branches,  for  the  great  question  of  the 
season,  the  location  of  the  nest,  is  to  be  settled,  and  quickly, 
too. 

There  are  many  things  that  the  bird  couple  have  to  con- 
sider :  the  home  must  be  within  convenient  distance  of  the 
proper  food  supply;  there  must  be  some  protection  from 
sun  and  rain,  even  if  it  is  only  a  few  leaves,  or  a  tuft  of 
grass ;  and  then  loom  up  the  enemies  to  be  avoided,  —  birds 
of  prey,  squirrels,  snakes,  and  man.  Of  the  four,  the  birds 
seem  to  dread  man  the  least,  and  are  constantly  appealing 
to  him,  and  taking  him  into  their  confidence  as  a  protector 
against  the  others.  Poor  little  birds!  they  do  not  realize 
that  man  with  all  his  higher  intelligence  is  really  the  most 
relentless  of  all.  The  other  enemies  kill  for  food  only,  man 
kills  for  food  casually,  for  decorative  feathers  wantonly,  and

for  scientific  research  plausibly,  with  the  apology  that  the 
end  and  aim  is  knowledge.  Are  not  the  lives  of  hundreds 
of  song-birds  a  high  price  for  the  gain  of  a  doubtful  new 
species,  which  only  causes  endless  discussion  as  to  whether 
it  really  is  a  species  or  merely  a  freak  ?  One  ornithologist 
proudly  makes  the  record  that,  in  the  space  of  less  than 
three  weeks,  he  shot  fifty-eight  Eose-breasted  Grosbeaks, 
to  ascertain  their  average  article  of  diet,  and  this  slaughter 
was  in  the  breeding  season !  There  is  also  the  stubbornly 
ignorant  farmer,  who  measures  only  by  dollars  and  cents 
and  sets  his  hand  against  all  birds,  because  half  a  dozen 
kinds  in  the  excess  of  their  friendliness  invite  themselves 
to  supper  in  his  berry  patch,  and  think  that  no  perch  is  so 
suitable  for  their  morning  singing  as  a  cherry  tree  in  June. 

Now  is  the  time  to  study  all  the  best  attributes  of  bird 
life,  the  period  when  we  may  judge  the  birds  by  our  own 
standard,  finding  that  their  code  of  manners  and  morality 
nearly  meets  our  own.  We  see  them  as  individuals  having 
the  same  diversity  of  character  as  people  of  different  nations, 
and  it  is  in  the  homes  that  we  can  best  see  their  ruling 
instincts.  Each  bird  now  has  a  mind  of  his  own  and  devel- 
ops his  own  ideas.     He  is  master  of  many  arts. 

If  you  wish  to  see  all  this,  habit  yourself  in  sober  colours, 
wear  soft,  well-tried  shoes,  and  something  on  your  head  that 
shall  conceal  rather  than  betray  your  presence,  —  Mrs.  Olive 
Thome  Miller's  leaf-covered  hat  is  a  clever  invention.  Do 
you  realize  how  large  you  appear  to  the  bird,  whose  eyes 
have  very  many  times  the  magnifying  power  of  our  own  ? 
Walk  gently  but  naturally,  do  not  step  on  dry  branches,  but 
at  the  same  time  avoid  a  mincing  gait.  Have  you  not 
noticed  in  the  sick-room,  that  a  light  easy  tread  is  far  less 
distracting  than  a  fussy  tiptoeing?  Do  not  make  sudden 
motions,  especially  of  the  arms, —  a  writer  has  said  that  birds 
are  much  more  afraid  of  man's  arms  than  of  man  himself. 

Go  through  the  lanes  where  the  bushes  hedge  and  the 
trees  arch^  thread  between  the  clumps  of  crabs  and  briars 
that  dot  waste  pastures,  watch  every  tree  and  vine  in  the 
garden,  skirt  the  hay  meadows  (their  owners  will  hardly  let

you  tramp  through  them),  for  there  will  be  Bobolinks  in  the 
timothy.  Best  of  all,  swing  a  hammock  in  the  old  orchard, 
and,  lying  in  it,  you  will  see  and  hear  so  much  that,  wonder- 
ing greatly,  you  will  agree  with  Burroughs  when  he  says, 
"I  only  know  that  birds  have  a  language  which  is  very 
expressive  and  which  is  easily  translatable  into  the  human 
tongue." 

After  watching  the  skill  that  builds  the  nest,  it  is  dif- 
ficult to  overestimate  the  individual  beauty  of  some  of  the 
structures.  Comparatively  few,  outside  of  the  charmed  cir- 
cle, know  the  diversity  of  form  and  materials  shown  in  nest 
building,  and  the  wonderful  adaptability  of  both,  by  the 
bird,  to  its  special  needs. 

The  length  of  time  which  a  nest  remains  in  use  varies 
with  different  birds.  Burroughs  says  in  the  chapter  on 
Birds'  Nests,  in  his  perennial  "  Wake  Eobin,"  ^  "  The  birds 
may  be  divided,  with  respect  to  this  and  kindred  points,  into 
five  general  classes.  Eirst,  those  that  repair  or  appropriate  the 
last  year's  nest,  as  the  Wren,  Swallow,  Bluebird,  Great- 
crested  Flycatcher,  Owls,  Eagles,  Fish  Hawks,  and  a  few 
others.  Secondly,  those  that  build  anew  each  season,  though 
frequently  rearing  more  than  one  brood  in  the  same  nest. 
Of  these  the  Phoebe-bird  is  a  well-known  example.  Thirdly, 
those  that  build  a  new  nest  for  each  brood,  which  includes 
the  greatest  number  of  species.  Fourthly,  a  limited  number 
that  make  no  nest  of  their  own,  but  appropriate  the  aban- 
doned nests  of  other  birds.  Finally,  those  who  use  no  nest 
at  all,  but  deposit  their  eggs  in  the  sand,  which  is  the  case 
with  a  large  number  of  aquatic  fowls.'^ 

Birds'  nests  are  often  regarded  as  merely  aggregations  of 
sticks  and  straws  twisted  together  more  or  less  carelessly ; 
on  the  whole,  rather  monotonous,  dirty  affairs.  I  know  an 
observant  farmer  who  understands  all  the  weather  signs 
and  a  great  deal  of  woodcraft,  and  spends  his  year  in  the 
pasture,  field,  brush  lot,  and  woods ;  but  whose  ideas  of  birds' 
nests  are  purely  conventional.    He  does  not  call  any  structure

a  nest,  unless  it  follows  the  pattern  of  a  Kobin's  or  Sparrow's. 
I  asked  him  one  day  if  there  were  many  kinds  of  nests  in 
his  neighbourhood.  "  Wall,"  he  said,  leaning  on  his  axe  (for 
it  was  the  wood-chopping  season)  and  giving  a  reminiscent 
gaze  through  the  brush,  "there's  plenty  o'  birds,  but,  bless 
yer,  not  half  on  'em  makes  any  reg'lar  sort  o'  nests.  Sparrers 
and  Eobins  does,  an'  Catbirds  an'  Crows ;  but  S wallers  ony 
makes  mud-pies,  an'  Humbirds  jest  sets  down  right  where- 
ever  they  see  a  round  o'  moss  on  a  branch,  and  the  warmth 
o'  them  makes  the  moss  grow  up  a  bit,  but  I  don't  call  that 
a  nest.  The  Hangbird  (Oriole)  he  strings  up  a  bag  in  a 
tree,  an'  them  Red-eyed  Warblers  (Vireos)  hooks  a  mess 
o'  scraps  in  a  twig  fork,  but  those  ain't  real  nests :  an'  tree- 
mice  (Nuthatches)  don't  have  none  at  all,  jest  stuffs  a  few 
feathers  in  a  hole,  I  seen  one  to-day ; "  and  after  turning 
over  his  wood  he  produced  an  upright  branch  containing 
the  feather-lined  bed  of  the  White-breasted  Nuthatch. 

Spend  a  month  on  the  bird-quest,  or  a  week  even,  and 
your  eyes  will  be  opened  to  the  possibilities,  and  you  will 
become  alive  to  the  fact,  that  the  feathered  race  has  its 
artisans  the  same  as  the  human  brotherhood.  Weavers 
whose  looms  antedate  all  man's  inventions,  masons,  car- 
penters, frescoers,  decorators,  and  upholsterers,  its  skilled 
mechanics,  and  shiftless,  unskilled  labourers,  and  its  para- 
sitic tramps,  who  house  their  young  at  the  expense  of  others. 
As  for  varied  materials,  —  hay,  sticks,  feathers,  hair,  moss, 
bark,  fur,  hog-bristles,  dandelion-down,  mud,  catkins,  seed- 
pods,  lichens,  paper,  rags,  yarn,  and  snake  skins,  are  only 
a  part  of  the  bird  architect's  list  of  usable  things. 

You  must  not  hope  to  identify  all  the  nests  possible  to 
your  locality  in  a  single  season,  or  even  in  three  or  four,  but 
be  always  on  the  watch.  If  you  fail  to  see  the  birds  build, 
which  is  the  easiest  and  surest  way  of  knowing  the  nest, 
when  the  autumn  comes  and  the  leaves  fall  away  many 
nests  will  be  revealed  in  places  where  you  never  thought 
they  existed,  and  you  will  learn  where  to  look  another 
season.  If  these  nests  are  of  marked  types,  you  can  iden- 
tify them  even  in  the  autumn,  and  it  will  give  you  a  new 

14 


THE  BUILDING  OF   THE  NEST. 

interest  in  the  waning  season ;  something  to  look  for  in  the 
naked  woods,  a  motive  for  winter  walks.  Though  many  of 
the  frailer  structiu-es  melt  away  or  are  torn  down  by  high 
winds,  the  more  carefully  woven  ones  often  remain  over  the 
winter. 

On  looking  out  one  morning  last  January,  after  a  night 
when  a  light,  thawing  snow  had  been  followed  by  a  sharp 
freeze,  I  was  surprised  and  fascinated  by  the  appearance 
-of  an  Oriole's  nest  which  hung  from  an  elm  near  the  house, 
and  which  had  been  invisible  before.  Its  gray  pocket  was 
brimful  of  soft  snow,  which  was  oozing  out  of  the  top  like 
foam,  while  the  outside  was  coated  with  thin  ice,  which 
accentuated  the  woven  strands  and  hung  down  in  fantastic 
icicles  scintillating  in  the  sun. 

Another  winter  day  I  was  attracted  by  seeing  a  field- 
mouse  run  from  a  tuft  of  grass  at  the  root  of  a  small  bush, 
and  I  found  there  a  nest,  presumably  that  of  a  Song  Spar- 
row, containing  two  Sparrow  eggs  and  one  belonging  to  the 
Cowbird.  The  nest  had  evidently  been  abandoned  on 
account  of  the  alien  egg,  and  it  made  a  convenient  hiding- 
place  for  the  mouse,  who  had  nibbled  at  the  eggs  and  found 
their  contents  dried  away.  In  the  autumn  and  winter  you 
may  appropriate  the  nests  you  find,  and  examine  and  pull 
them  apart  with  a  freedom  which,  if  indulged  in  during  the 
spring  or  early  summer,  would  give  many  a  bird  the  heart- 
ache and  an  added  distrust  of  bipeds. 

Do  you  remember  the  January  entry  in  Thoreau's 
journal?  "Another  bright  winter's  day,  to  the  woods  to 
see  what  birds'  nests  are  made  of." 

Now  if  you  are  interested,  awake,  and  clear-eyed,  go  out 
as  I  have  said,  and  I  will  lead  you,  figuratively,  telling  you 
what  you  may  find  as  a  foretaste.  Begin  near  at  home ;  go 
through  the  garden  first,  then  to  the  nearest  field  and  the 
bit  of  marsh-bordered  wood.  Do  not  go  further  than  where 
you  may  walk  without  ceremony  or  fuss.  Never  make  a 
laborious  tour  of  the  bird-quest,  or  think  that  you  must  live 
in  a  tent  remote  from  people,  in  order  to  name  the  majority 
of  our  every-day  birds.

INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

My  first  tramping-ground  was  the  garden,  enclosing  eight 
acres  of  varied  land,  flowers,  brush,  open,  plenty  of  trees, 
deciduous  and  evergreen,  and  a  little  pool  of  clear  water. 
During  the  seasons  of  which  I  have  the  record  forty  species 
of  birds  have  nested  within  its  borders,  and  oftentimes  many 
pairs  of  the  same  species ;  for  example,  as  last  year,  when 
the  garden  sheltered  five  pensile  nests  of  the  Red-eyed 
Vireo.  These  forty  nests  were  located  in  the  following 
manner :  — 

Bobin :  In  vines,  hedge,  and  trees. 
Wood  Thrush :  Spruces,  bushes. 
.Catbird :  Syringa  bushes,  and  other  shrubs. 
Bluebird :  Hole  in  old  tree  and  bird-house. 
Wren :  Little  houses  and  in  outbuildings. 
Yellow  Warbler :  Apple  tree  and  elder  bushes. 
Maryland  Yellow-throat :  Tall  grass  and  bushes. 
Chat :  Barberry  bush. 
Bedstart:  Spruces. 
Tanager :  Swamp  oak. 
Barn  Swallow :  Hay  loft. 
Purple  Martin :  Bird-house. 

Bed- eyed  Vireo :  Sugar-maple,  apple  tree,  and  birches. 
White-eyed  Vireo:  Beech. 
English  Sparrow :  Everywhere,  until  banished. 
Purple  Finch :  Old  quince-hedge. 
Goldfinch :  Sugar-maples. 
Vesper  Sparrow :  Smoke-bush. 
Grasshopper  Sparrow :  Under  small  spruce. 
Song  Sparrow :  In  many  places,  —  hedge,  bushes,  ground. 
Chipping  Sparrow :  High  in  evergreens,  also  in  shrubs. 
^ield  Sparrow :  Meadow-sweet  bush. 
Towhee :  On  ground  under  a  wild  grape  tangle. 
Coiobird :  Eggs  found  in  the  nests  of  a  dozen  different  birds,  particu- 
larly the  Song  Sparrow's. 
Orchard  Oriole :  Old  apple  tree. 
Baltimore  Oriole :  Elms  on  lawn. 
Crow :  Top  of  spruce. 
Kingbird :  In  pear  tree. 

Phoebe :  On  beams  in  shed,  also  on  bracket  supporting  the  porch. 
Chimney  Swift :  In  brick-chimney. 
Hummingbird :  Cedars,  elm,  beech,  and  high  in  a  spruce. 
Yellow-billed  Cuckoo :  Wild  tangle  of  vines,  etc. 

,    16 


THE  BUILDING  OF  THE  NEST. 

Flicker :  Sassafras  and  hickory. 
Hairy  Woodpecker:  Hickory. 
Mourning  Dove :  White  pines. 
Quail :  Under  a  thick,  wild  hedge. 
Screech  Owl :  Hollow  sassafras. 
Barred  Owl  (only  once)  :  In  a  sycamore. 
Cedar-bird :  Old  cherry  tree. 

You  may  add  to  these,  as  nests  perfectly  possible  to 
find,  those  of  the  birds  of  marshy-edged  meadows,  —  the 
Bobolink,  Meadowlark,  and  the  Ked-winged  Blackbird; 
the  Rose-breasted  Grosbeak,  nesting  in  bushy  pastures ;  the 
White-bellied  Swallow  of  bird-boxes  and  hollow  trees ;  the 
Bank  Swallow,  who  burrows  holes  in  railroad  cuts,  river 
and  other  sand-banks,  where  you  may  also  discover  the 
Kingfisher's  home.  In  the  river  and  creek  marshes  you 
will  find  the  torch-shaped  nests  of  the  Long-billed  Marsh- 
wren  and  the  tussock  nests  of  the  Sharp-tailed  Finch  and 
the  Seaside  Sparrow.  In  swampy  woods  you  may  discover 
a  heronry,  or  at  least  some  single  nests  of  the  Green  Heron, 
or  the  familiar  Black-crowned  Night  Heron ;  and,  perhaps, 
in  some  great  tree  leaning  over  the  water  you  will  see  the 
huge  platform-nest  of  the  Osprey.  The  Marsh  Hawks, 
Least  Bittern,  and  Marsh  Owls  choose  similar  locations, 
and  in  the  heart  of  the  fresh-water  marshes  the  Clapper 
and  Virginia  Rails,  the  Spotted  Sandpiper  and  Woodcock, 
breed,  though  the  latter  more  frequently  nests  in  dry  woods 
near  a  swamp. 

Inland  woods,  especially  if  traversed  by  a  stream,  will 
yield  countless  nests :  on  the  ground,  the  Veery's,  the  Oven- 
bird's  hut,  and  the  Ruffed  Grouse's  heap  of  leaves ;  above,  in 
the  trees,  nests  of  the  Blue  Jay,  Yellow-throated  and  War- 
bling Vireo,  and  the  White-breasted  Nuthatch.  In  drier 
woods  the  Blue- winged  Warbler  builds  upon  the  ground; 
and  the  Black-throated  Green  Warbler  nests  in  the  hem- 
locks ;  while  in  high  rocky  woods  you  will  see  the  eggs  of 
the  Whip-poor-will  and  Nighthawk,  lying  in  depressions  of 
the  ground,  and  with  your  glass  discern  the  nests  of  Hawks 
and  Owls  in  the  tree  tops.

INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

"  I  am  poorly  situated ;  there  are  no  birds  in  my  vicinity 
except  Kobius  and  Wrens,"  you  say.  Nonsense !  it  is  impos- 
sible. You  make  me  feel  as  Dean  Hole,  the  genial  ecclesias- 
tical rose-grower  did  when  certain  lazy  amateur  gardeners, 
after  admiring  his  rose  garden,  said  that  they  could  not 
grow  roses  because  their  soil  was  unsuitable,  exclaiming, 
"  Oh,  what  a  garden  yours  is  for  roses  !  Old  Mr.  Drone,  our 
gardener,  tells  us  he  never  saw  such  soil  as  yours  nor  so  bad 
a  soil  as  ours  for  roses."  And  the  Dean  dryly  exclaimed, 
"  Herein  lies  a  fact  in  horticulture,  —  Mr.  Drone  always  has 
a  bad  soil." 

Get  the  best  possible  results  from  your  limited  area,  and 
if  it  is  anything  better  than  a  back  yard,  you  need  not  be 
discouraged.  The  difficulty  wdth  us  Americans  is  that  we 
are  accustomed  to  a  limitless  extent  of  country,  and  scram- 
ble carelessly  over  it,  in  our  amateur  scientific  investiga- 
tions, as  well  as  in  other  ways,  instead  of  thoroughly 
studying  home  first.  If  the  English  naturalists  ranged  as 
wildly  as  we  do,  they  would  exhaust  the  island,  and  fall  off 
the  edge  in  a  month.  White,  of  Selborne,  has  left  us  a 
book  that  is  classic,  from  his  knowledge  of  one  county,  and 
our  Thoreau  has  given  us  the  perfect  literature  of  wood- 
craft from  his  intimate  knowledge  of  a  comparatively  small 
area. 

The  first  nest  that  you  will  probably  find,  and  one  that 
will  confront  you  at  every  turn,  will  be  the  Robin's.  Com- 
mon, rough  in  structure,  and  anything  but  pretty,  it  is  a 
type  nevertheless;  being  partly  made  of  sticks  and  lined 
with  clay,  it  is  a  combination  of  carpentry  and  masonry. 
The  Wood  Thrush  also  uses  mud  in  a  similar  manner,  but 
builds  more  neatly.  Sparrows  you  will  find  lodged  every- 
where, —  in  the  hedge,  under  bushes,  by  thick  grass  tufts, 
—  their  individual  nests  being  so  much  alike  that  it  is  diffi- 
cult to  distinguish  them  apart.  Dried  grass  and  fine  roots 
are  the  chief  materials  used  by  them,  with  the  exception  of 
the  little  Chipping  Sparrow,  who  combines  horsehair  and 
pine-needles  with  the  grasses,  which,  together  with  its 
delicacy  and  small  size,  identify  the  nest.

THE  BUILDING  OF  THE  NEST. 

Kext  comes  the  Catbird,  with  a  twig  lattice,  and  the 
Wren,  with  a  feather-lined  pile  in  the  little  house  provided 
for  her ;  or,  lacking  the  house,  she  uses  an  old  hat  or  boot 
leg,  instead.  The  Thrasher  chooses  a  stout  bush,  and  tosses 
together  a  bunch  of  grape-vine  bark,  sedge  grass,  and  strong 
tendrils,  in  a  way  to  correspond  with  his  bravura  music. 
The  Purple  Finch  sets  his  large,  sparrow-like  nest  in  a  high 
bush ;  you  must  visit  it  often,  for  you  will  always  hear  good 
music  close  by. 

The  Flicker  utilizes  a  soft  place  in  the  swamp  maple, 
boring  his  nest  hole  with  great  accuracy ;  the  Yellow  War- 
bler and  Hummingbird  strip  the  soft  wool  that  wrapped 
the  big,  juicy  Osmunda  ferns  in  their  winter  sleep.  The 
Warbler  mixes  the  fernwool  with  cobwebs  and  milkweed 
flax,  taking  it  to  the  apple  tree;  while  the  Hummingbird 
bears  his  load  to  a  mossed  cedar  branch,  and  rounds  a  two- 
inch  nest,  blending  it  with  the  branch  until  it  looks  merely  as 
if  lichens  had  encrusted  a  raised  knot  hole.  Next  you  will 
admire  the  work  of  the  weavers,  —  the  Orioles  and  Vireos. 
The  darned  basket  of  the  Orchard  Oriole  is,  perhaps,  set 
in  the  strawberry-apple  tree,  as  if  to  catch  its  early  fruit ;  he 
makes  his  beak  point  his  shuttle ;  as  Coues  says,  antedating 
Elias  Howe,  who  invented  a  needle  with  the  eye  at  the 
point ;  and  the  Baltimore  Oriole  treads  flax  from  old  milk- 
weed stalks,  gathering  his  string  far  and  near.  The  Balti- 
more Oriole  builds  too  well  to  work  quickly ;  and  the  pouch, 
sometimes  eight  inches  deep,  swings  freely  and  firmly  from 
its  branch,  so  placed  as  to  be  safe  from  above  and  below. 

The  Vireos  make  a  little  pocket  (like  a  stocking  heel  set 
between  the  knitting-needles)  which  is  fastened  firmly  in 
the  fork  of  a  small  branch.  Woven  into  it  are  papers, 
scraps  of  hornets'  nests,  and  flakes  of  decayed  wood.  The 
Solitary  Vireo  adds  hair  and  fur  to  his,  and  the  Ked-eyed 
Vireo,  the  wings  of  moths  and  other  insects,  cocoons,  and 
snake  skins.  It  was  in  the  nest  of  this  Vireo,  that  Hamil- 
ton Gibson  found  twisted  a  bit  of  newspaper,  whose  single 
legible  sentence  read:  "...  have  in  view  the  will  of 
God."

INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

To  go  into  much  detail  now  may  confuse  you  wholly,  and 
you  will  find  that  every  bird  has  a  description  of  its  haunts, 
nest,  and  eggs,  in  its  particular  division ;  this  sketch  is  only 
to  show  you  the  possibilities.  There  is  one  more  nest  that 
I  must  mention,  —  the  prettiest  thing  that  you  may  ever 
hope  to  find  when  on  the  quest,  —  the  lace  hammock  of  the 
Parula  Warbler.  You  must  search  for  it  early  in  June,  in 
remote  but  rather  thin  woods,  but  never  very  far  away  from 
running  water;  often  it  is  on  a  branch  that  overhangs  a 
stream.  Sometimes  it  will  be  on  a  slender  birch  twig  and 
sometimes  on  the  terminal  spray  of  the  hemlock-spruce.  It 
is  suspended  lightly,  like  a  watch-pocket  with  the  opening 
on  one  side,  and  made  of  a  delicate  lace-work  from  the  gray- 
white  usnea  moss,  that  grows  on  old  trees.  The  whole 
fabric  swaying  in  the  breeze  is  the  work  of  the  two  little 
birds  with  slate-blue  backs  and  yellow  breasts,  who  are 
watching  you  so  anxiously.  No,  you  must  not  take  it  now ; 
it  will  keep  until  they  are  through  with  it,  for  it  is  much 
more  durable  than  it  appears. 

The  biulding  of  the  nest  will  raise  many  questions  in  your 
mind.  Do  both  birds  take  part  in  building?  Does  the 
female  select  the  site  and  do  the  work  and  the  male  simply 
supply  her  with  materials  ?  Very  pretty  tales  are  told  of 
the  rejection  of  unsuitable  stuff  by  the  particular  wife  of 
a  non-discriminating  spouse  and  the  consequent  squabble. 
Alack !  did  not  the  labour  question,  as  well  as  that  of  the 
equality  of  the  sexes,  begin  as  near  to  Eden  as  the  building 
of  the  nest  ?    But  in  spite  of  this  there  are  still  nests  I

THE  WATER-BIRDS. 

With  mingled  sound  of  horas  and  bells, 
A  far-heard  clang,  the  Wild  Geese  fly, 

Storm  sent  from  Arctic  moors  and  fells, 
Like  a  great  arrow  through  the  sky.  —  Whittier. 

Whex  you  think  of  the  Water-birds,  you  say,  perhaps, 
that  they  are  uninteresting,  have  no  song,  and  inhabit 
marshy  and  desolate  places ;  the  Gulls  are  picturesque,  to  be 
sure,  but  as  for  the  others,  Snipe,  Rail,  and  Ducks,  they  are 
only  Game-birds  and  so  much  food,  of  a  variety  that  does 
not  particularly  suit  your  palate.  This  is  because  you  have 
regarded  them  as  mere  merchandise,  and  have  never  seen 
or  considered  them  as  living  birds,  winging  their  way  over 
the  lonely  marshes  and  wind-swept  beaches,  clad  in  feathers 
that  blend  in  their  hues  the  sky,  the  water,  the  mottled 
sands  of  the  shore,  the  bronzed  splendour  of  the  seaweeds, 
and  the  opalescence  that  lines  the  sea-shell.  Though  in  a 
sense  they  are  songless,  their  call  notes  are  keyed  in  harmony 
with  the  winds  that  they  combat,  and  the  creaking  reeds  that 
hide  their  nests,  and  their  signalling  cries  rise  as  distinctly 
above  the  more  melodious  sounds  of  Kature  as  the  whistle 
of  the  distant  buoy  sounding  above  the  surf. 

The  very  remoteness  of  the  Water-birds  gives  them  a 
charm  for  certain  natures.  They  do  not  build  in  the  garden 
and  come  about  your  door  craving  attention ;  you  must  not 
only  go  half-way  to  meet  them,  but  all  the  way,  and  that 
too  right  cautiously.  There  is  an  invigorating  spice  of 
adventure  when  the  bird-quest  tends  shoreward,  whether 
it  is  the  banks  of  a  river  or  lake  that  furnishes  shelter  and 
sustenance  alike  to  the  nesting  bird  and  the  restless  migrant ; 
or  the  shore  of  the  sea  with  its  possibilities  and  changing 
moods, — the  sea  that  stretches  infinitely  on,  ribbed  by  light-

guarded  reefs,  where  the  Gulls  flock  and  the  Petrels  dash 
in  the  wake  of  cautious  ships,  its  arms  reaching  landward 
until  the  bay,  where  the  Wild  Ducks  float,  laps  the  shore, 
where  the  Sandpipers  patter ;  and  creeping  on  through  the 
land  as  a  sluggish  creek,  traverses  the  marshes  where  the 
Eail  clamours  about  his  half-floating  nest,  and  finally  ming- 
ling with  fresh  downward  currents  loses  its  way  among  gaunt 
trees,  where  the  Herons  and  Bitterns  build,  and  is  absorbed 
by  some  low,  wood-girt  meadow,  where  the  last  earth-filtered 
drops  make  mud,  from  which  the  Snipe  and  Woodcock 
probe  their  insect  food,  and  give  a  deeper  green  to  the 
coarse  grasses  where  the  Plover  pipes. 

The  Water-birds  have  another  claim  also  upon  your  at- 
tention ;  you  may  study  them  in  autumn  and  winter,  and  they 
fill  many  gaps  in  the  bird  year  by  their  presence  at  seasons 
when  the  Land-birds  are  few.  The  majority  of  Water- 
birds  come  to  us  as  migrants,  or  as  winter  visitors :  the 
Herons,  Bitterns,  several  of  the  Rails,  a  few  Plovers,  and 
Sandpipers  breed  in  our  marshes,  and  the  beautiful  Wood 
Duck  nests  in  the  river  copse.  When  these  birds  breed, 
however,  the  high  tides  and  spring-flooded  meadows  render 
it  very  difficult  to  approach  the  nests,  or  to  gain  a  satisfac- 
tory knowledge  of  the  birds  themselves,  and  the  same  diffi- 
culty obtains  in  watching  the  migrants  on  their  upward 
course.  But  in  autumn  the  conditions  are  changed,  espe- 
cially in  seasons  of  summer  drought,  and  as  the  Land-birds 
withdraw,  one  by  one,  you  will  have  the  leisure  to  go  shore- 
ward. 

The  Plovers,  Rails,  and  Sandpipers  begin  to  gather  in 
early  August,  and  from  that  time  until  the  rivers  and 
creeks  are  ice  coated,  the  Water-fowls  will  be  passing  every 
day,  and  from  twilight  until  dawn.  Various  Ducks  will  go 
over  the  garden  itself,  and  next  day  you  will  find  them  feed- 
ing in  the  sluggish  marsh  pools,  where  you  gathered  the  cat- 
tail-flags and  rose-mallows,  or  else  floating  on  the  mill-pond 
in  the  place  of  the  summer  lilies. 

The  Gulls  return  to  the  bar  and  shore  islands,  from  their 
breeding-haunts  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  Sound.     The  old

charcoal  burner,  coming  down  from  the  hills  with  his  dusky 
load,  after  the  first  light  snow,  tells  of  the  Wild  Geese  that 
passed  over  his  clearing  the  night  before,  and  settled  on  the 
Forge  Pond,  and  that  when  long  John  Hunt  went  after 
them  in  the  morning,  his  gun  kicked  and  knocked  him  into 
the  worse  bog  hole ;  whereupon  the  whole  flock  flew  away, 
laughing  fit  to  kill  themselves ;  and  adding  with  a  hoarse 
chuckle,  "Sarved  him  right,  too;  never  gives  nuthin'  he 
gits  to  neighbours,  allers  sends  'em  to  N'York." 

In  November  and  December,  the  hardy  but  inedible  Sea 
Ducks  return  from  the  north,  and  settle  noisily  in  their 
winter  quarters;  and  all  through  the  fall  the  lighthouse- 
keeper  sends  ashore  some  of  the  rarer  migrants  that,  dazed 
and  storm-blown,  have  dashed  to  death  against  his  tower; 
and,  as  a  bird-lover,  he  will  find  you  out.  If,  in  the  autumn 
or  early  winter,  you  should  chance  to  spend  a  little  time 
among  the  lakes,  or  along  the  real  searcoast,  from  Massa- 
chusetts southward  to  the  Chesapeake,  a  new  pathway  of 
delight  will  stretch  before  you,  —  read  of  the  Searbirds  that 
Celia  Thaxter  entertained  at  Appledore  in  her  Island  Gar- 
den. And  now  that  many  people  take  their  outings  about 
the  eastern  shore,  overrunning  the  pleasant  islands,  you  too, 
may  see  the  summer  nesting  of  the  Gulls  and  Terns,  birds 
that  before  you  had  considered  mysterious  wanderers  from 
the  north. 

These  Water-birds,  that  count  space  as  nothing  and  dis- 
tance the  swiftest  locomotive  in  their  flight,  ever  on  the 
wing  from  the  very  necessities  of  their  existence,  always 
bring  with  them  some  of  the  atmosphere  of  their  native 
haunts.  The  Wild  Ducks,  hanging  in  the  market-stall,  still 
wear  on  their  wings  a  patch  of  rainbow  colour,  as  if  stamped 
there  by  the  sun  and  mist  through  which  they  took  their 
first  flight.  Call  these  birds  songless,  give  them  any  names 
you  please,  they  will  remain  mysteries,  coming  out  of  the 
sky  and  disappearing  again  in  its  horizon,  pushing  on  to 
an  invisible  haven;  because  their  homes  are  so  remote 
we  do  not  realize  that  they  are  like  other  birds,  and  we 
forget,  when  the  garden  trees  are  full  of  nests  and  sway

with  ecstatic  music,  that  the  Water-fowl,  hastening  along  at 
twilight,  is  swayed  by  the  same  longings,  that  they  guide 
him  surely  to  his  journey's  close. 

And  soon  that  toil  shall  end, 
Soon  Shalt  thou  find  a  summer  home,  and  rest, 
And  scream  among  thy  fellows :  reeds  shall  bend

BIRDS   OF  AUTUMN  AND   WINTER. 

Dimly  I  catch  the  throb  of  distant  flails : 

Silently  overhead  the  Hen-hawk  sails, 

With  watchful,  measuring  eye  and  for  his  quarry  waits. 

— Lowell. 

During  the  last  week  in  August  there  is  a  decided  stii 
among  the  feathered  folk.  The  summer  residents  who  have 
been  moulting  in  seclusion  for  the  last  month,  emerge  from 
their  retreats  and  are  joined  by  flocks  of  others  of  similar 
species,  who  have  summered  further  north,  and  who  will 
remain  with  us  for  several  weeks  before  beginning  their 
downward  trip. 

By  calling  certain  species  resident,  it  does  not  necessarily 
mean  that  the  same  individuals  remain  in  one  place  for  the 
entire  year.  Except  in  the  breeding-season  all  birds  rove 
about,  even  if  they  do  not  absolutely  migrate,  guided  in 
their  course  by  the  food  supply  and  the  weather.  Tbe  food 
supply  is  tbe  more  potent  motive  of  the  two,  for  many 
insect-eating  birds  like  the  Flycatchers  and  Vireos  could 
winter  with,  us  in  the  protection  of  hedges  and  evergreens ; 
but  with  the  coming  of  frost  their  food  is  cut  off.  Even 
the  seed-eating  birds,  like  the  hardy  Goldfinches,  Buntings, 
and  Juncos,  are  often  driven  to  begging  about  barns  and 
granaries  when  a  sudden  snow-storm  covers  the  low  herbs 
and  grasses  upon  whose  seeds  they  subsist. 

It  is  during  the  last  week  in  August  that  the  Baltimore 
Orioles  gather,  and  pipe  with  an  anxious  note  in  their 
voices,  as  much  as  to  say,  "  It  is  very  pleasant  here  still, 
but  we  must  be  off  before  the  leaves  grow  thin  and  betray 
us  to  our  enemies."  The  Kingbirds  swoop  and  call,  going 
nearer  to  the  house  than  usual.  With  September  comes  the 
first  decisive  gathering  of  the  bird  clans.  The  Swallows 
flock  in  the  low  meadows  and  on  the  edge  of  the  beaches, 

25 


INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

flying  and  counter-flying,  as  if  to  strengthen  their  wings  for 
the  long  journey ;  hordes  of  them  wintering  as  far  south  as 
the  Bahamas.  The  cheery  Yellow  Warblers  disappear  from 
the  orchards,  and  the  Veery  comes  from  the  moist  woods 
and  scratches  in  the  shrubbery. 

Now  you  may  look  for  the  numerous  Warblers  as  they 
pass ;  but  you  must  be  alert,  for  they  go  silently  and  may 
only  stop  for  a  day.  The  length  of  time  that  migrating 
birds  remain  varies  greatly  with  different  seasons ;  during 
some  autumns  they  linger,  and  then  again,  without  any 
apparent  reason,  they  hurry  along,  arriving  and  departing 
sometimes  the  same  night,  so  that  you  will  be  unconscious 
that  they  have  passed  at  all. 

The  most  conspicuous  summer  residents  that  slip  away 
during  September,  are  the  Baltimore  Orioles,  Veeries,  Chats, 
Wood  Thrushes,  Flycatchers,  Eose-breasted  Grosbeaks,  and 
Bobolinks.  The  Chimney  Swifts  go  in  the  wake  of  the 
Swallows,  and  closely  resemble  them  in  habit  if  not  in 
anatomical  structure.  We  miss  these  birds  of  the  air  sadly, 
for  their  beautiful  flights  are  the  great  feature  of  early 
September.  The  voiceless  brown  Bobolinks  are  driven 
from  the  shelter  of  the  reeds  and  marsh-grasses  by  the 
gunners,  and  in  early  evening,  if  you  go  down  the  lane,  their 
clinking,  metallic  call  can  be  heard  as  they  fly  over.  The 
Wood  Thrushes  leave  quietly ;  gathering  for  a  week  or  so 
in  low  trees,  at  this  season  their  only  note  is  a  dry  chirp 
resembling  the  shaking  of  peas  in  a  sieve.  The  last  of  the 
month  the  Chickadees  emerge  and  become  prominent,  and 
the  Juncos  arrive  in  straggling  flocks. 

The  Kobins  flock  in  great  numbers,  and  occasionally  give 
a  sweet,  reminiscent  song;  the  Bluebirds  are  legion  and 
bustle  about,  calling,  as  Burroughs  says  they  do  in  autumn, 
"Bermuda!  Bermuda!"  The  Goldfinches  are  no  longer 
yellow,  but  you  can  always  distinguish  them  by  their  dip- 
ping flight.  Purple  Grackles  and  Ked-winged  Blackbirds 
are  also  gathering,  and  the  Wrens  are  peeping  in  and  out, 
but  they  have  forgotten  how  to  scold.  The  scanty  music 
is  furnished  chiefly  by  the  faithful  Song  Sparrow,  the 

26 


BIRDS  OF  AUTUMN  AND  WINTER. 

Purple  Finch,  and  the  Chicadee;  there  are  individuals  of 
every  species  who  do  a  little  autumn  singing,  but  it  is  heard 
only  from  solitary  voices. 

Meanwhile,  the  tiny  Kuby-crowned  Kinglet,  and  the 
Myrtle,  Palm,  and  Bay-breasted  Warblers  make  us  a  visit, 
and  the  Brown  Creeper,  Black  and  White  Warblers,  and 
White-breasted  Nuthatches  circle  the  trees. 

By  the  first  of  October,  the  Blue  Jays  have  returned  from 
the  deep  woods  where  they  nested,  and  are  in  full  scream,  as 
is  their  wont.  Hermit  Thrushes  come  and  go,  together  with 
the  Thrashers.  The  Tanagers  disappear,  and  the  Vireos  one 
and  all  are  packing  their  belongings.  The  lively  Eed-eyed 
Vireo,  who  has  preached  and  laughed  at  you  all  summer 
from  the  maples,  is  taking  a  farewell  peep  under  every  bit 
of  loose  bark,  determined  not  to  leave  one  insect  behind. 
You  miss  the  Catbirds  also,  and  in  looking  for  them  you 
will  find  an  occasional  Pine  Finch  or  Winter  Wren.  Quail 
and  Buffed  Grouse  (Partridge)  scramble  furtively  along  road- 
sides and  through  the  stubble  fields,  and  the  Osprey  fishes 
more  boldly. 

All  the  while  the  various  Warblers  are  trooping  by,  young 
and  old  together ;  if  you  have  not  recognized  them  in 
spring,  you  will  be  sadly  puzzled  now.  The  White-throated 
Sparrows  hop  along  the  paths,  giving  a  few  sweet  notes,  —  "  Pe- 
peabody-peabody-peabody,"  —  but  without  the  springtime 
fervour,  and  the  rarer  White-crowned  Sparrows  show  them- 
selves warily.  In  fact,  the  greater  part  of  this  family  are 
on  the  move,  and  even  the  ranks  of  Song  Sparrows  are 
thinning.  The  Black-throated  Green  and  the  Black-throated 
Blue  Warblers  come  about  the  spruces  again;  the  Phoebes 
vanish  and  the  trim  Towhee  no  longer  hops  jauntily  among 
the  briars.  If  there  is  an  early  frost  the  flocks  go  quickly, 
but  otherwise  all  the  birds  linger.  We  have  Hummingbirds 
here  in  the  garden  through  October,  unless  the  weather  is 
very  gusty ;  for  I  think  that  all  birds  dread  wind  more  than 
cold. 

The  third  week  of  October  sees  the  last  of  the  Golden- 
crowned  Thrushes  and  Maryland  Yellow-throats,  the  Fox

INTRODUCTORY  CHAPTERS. 

Sparrows  pay  a  flying  visit,  and  the  Red-breasted  Nuthatches 
settle  down.  Even  if  there  has  been  no  hard  frost,  Novem- 
ber is  sure  to  bring  it,  and  then  in  the  afterglow,  the  illusive 
Indian  summer,  we  begin  to  realize  that  the  song-birds 
have  left  us.  Grackles  we  have  and  Meadowlarks,  but  the 
Robins  and  Bluebirds  are  diminishing,  and  after  the  middle 
of  November  the  birds  that  you  see  may  safely  be  called 
winter  residents. 

The  Blue  Jay  becomes  very  conspicuous  now,  and  in  late 
November  walks  you  will  constantly  see  his  pointed  crest, 
while  his  harsh  notes  no  longer  jar  upon  your  ear,  but  sound 
companionable.  Most  likely  he  is  nutting,  and  jeering  and 
laughing  at  the  squirrels  who  are  filling  their  paunches 
under  the  same  tree.  If,  however,  "  he  laughs  best  who 
laughs  last,"  the  squirrels  have  decidedly  the  best  of  it,  for 
they  frequently  find  the  holes  where  the  Jays  hide  their 
plunder  and  rob  them. 

Golden-crowned  Kinglets,  with  their  dainty  little  heads 
on  one  side,  peep  into  every  crevice  in  the  apple  trees,  giving 
a  shrill,  wiry  call,  the  Winter  Wrens  are  settled  in  their  old 
quarters  about  the  woodpile,  Pine  Warblers  come  in  bus- 
tling flocks.  White-throated  Sparrows  appear  at  rare  intervals, 
and  three,  at  least,  of  the  Woodpeckers. 

If  December  is  moderately  snowy  and  not  too  cold,  you 
will  see  a  distinct  change  even  among  the  winter  residents. 
The  Horned  Larks  become  quite  tame,  and  together  with 
the  Meadowlarks  keep  near  the  upland  farms,  and  if  the 
rivers  are  free  from  ice  the  Kingfisher  still  constitutes  him- 
self their  guardian.  The  Tree  Sparrow  takes  the  place  that 
the  Chipping  Sparrow  filled  in  summer,  resembling  it  both  in 
appearance  and  note,  and  the  Cedar-birds  come  from  their 
warm  coverts  and  feast  upon  the  remaining  berries  which 
are  now  completely  ripe  and  soft. 

The  Shrike  is  in  his  element  seeing  his  victims  afar 
through  the  leafless  trees,  the  Hawks  grow  bold  and  circle 
over  the  meadows  by  the  hour,  and  the  Barred  Owl,  with 
strange  blue-black  eyes,  leaves  the  wood  with  the  Great 
Horned  Qwl,  to  forage  in  the  brush  and  in  open  pastures.

BIRDS   OF  AUTUMN  AND   WINTER. 

If  you  hear  a  snapping  noise  in  the  pines  do  not  think  that 
it  is  merely  the  cones  springing  open,  for  you  will  find  a 
small  flock  of  Red  Crossbills,  whose  warped  beaks  seem 
particularly  adapted  to  tearing  the  scales  from  the  cones 
and  liberating  the  pungent  seeds.  Middle  December  is  the 
time  for  the  showy  Fine  Grosbeaks,  whose  stout  bodies  and 
brilliant  colouring  at  once  reveal  their  identity;  they  are 
sometimes  abundant  here  but  usually  straggle  about  in  pairs ; 
and  great  flocks  of  the  hardy  American  G-oldfinches  may  be 
seen  if  seed-bearing  plants  are  not  buried  up  by  the  snow. 
The  Crows  are  very  hungry  and  prowl  around  the  stacks  of 
dry  corn  stalks,  going  to  the  shore  for  clams  and  diift  scraps, 
and  returning  at  night  to  their  inland  cedar  roosts.  This  is 
the  season  that  you  may  successfully  give  them  poisoned 
corn,  thus  justly  killing  some  of  these  cannibals  who  create 
6uch  havoc  every  spring  among  the  nests  of  our  Song-birds. 

An  occasional  Purple  Finch  flies  out  of  the  evergreens, 
though  it  is  a  difficult  bird  to  recognize  at  this  season,  and  the 
Pine  Siskin  constantly  flits  in  and  out,  swinging  itself  under 
the  cones  and  terminal  sprays  like  an  acrobat,  and  this  is  the 
time  for  Snow  Buntings  and  the  little  Eedx3oll  Linnets.  If 
there  are  severe  storms  in  the  month,  accompanied  by  north- 
east gales,  many  of  these  birds  appear  on  the  very  crest  of 
the  storm,  and  when  it  ceases  troop  from  the  evergreens  in 
a  half-famished  condition,  searching  for  bare  places  where  a 
few  seeds  may  be  found.  The  Eedpoll  feeds  in  the  same 
localities  and  in  the  same  manner  as  the  American  Gold- 
finch, and,  having  a  similar  call  note,  it  is  quite  easy,  at  a 
little  distance,  to  mistake  one  for  the  other. 

Now  you  may  catch  a  glimpse  of  the  great  Snow  Owls. 
You  will  be  more  likely  to  find  them  back  of  the  shore, 
along  the  line  of  salt  marshes  and  woody  stubble,  than 
further  inland.  The  marshes  do  not  freeze  so  easily  or 
deeply  as  the  iron-bound  uplands,  and  field-mice  are  more 
plentiful  in  them.  This  alert  and  powerful  Owl  is  so  fleet 
of  wing  that  he  can  follow  and  capture  a  Snow  Bunting  or 
a  Junco  in  its  most  rapid  flight  if  his  appetite  is  whetted. 
Woodpeckers  have  mostly  drifted  southward,  and  this  is  the

time  of  greatest  hardship  for  all  birds  that  depend  in  any- 
way upon  insect  food.  The  Robins  leave,  except  for  a  few 
individuals ;  the  Quails  come  from  the  brush  and  feed  with 
the  Meadow  and  Horned  Larks.  The  four  resident  Hawks 
—  the  Sharp-shinned,  Cooper's,  the  Red-tailed,  and  Red- 
shouldered  —  are  now  the  only  inhabitants  of  the  woods  and 
remote  pastures;  there  is  something  invigorating  in  the 
way  in  which  they  sail  through  the  lonely  air.  Food  is 
very  scarce,  mice  are  snowed  under,  rabbits  do  not  ven- 
ture far  from  their  burrows,  and  it  is  too  early  for  young 
chickens.  Besides,  the  farmer's  vnie,  knowing  Hawk  ways, 
keeps  her  poultry  safely  guarded  in  a  sunny  place  in  view  of 
the  kitchen  window.  Alas !  for  the  flocks  of  Snow  Buntings 
that  have  been  tempted  too  far  afield.  Every  time  a  Hawk 
swoops,  and  dropping  suddenly  wheels  back  to  its  perch, 
there  is  one  Bunting  less  to  return  to  its  boreal  birthplace. 
The  Shrike  drops  on  his  prey  with  the  thud  and  click  of  the 
guillotine ;  the  Hawk  flashes  through  the  air  with  the  curv- 
ing sweep  of  the  scimiter. 

The  Brown  Creeper  is  seen  daily  winding  about  the  tree 
trunks ;  if  it  is  severely  cold  and  there  is  much  ice  he  only 
comes  at  mid-day  and  works  on  the  sunny  side  of  the  tree, 
while  his  friends,  the  Chickadees,  call  encouragingly  to  him. 
January,  with  us,  is  the  month  of  all  the  year  that  comes  the 
nearest  to  being  birdless;  there  are  days  when  not  even  a 
Crow  is  seen ;  then  a  mild  streak  follows,  and  the  murmur- 
ings  of  the  Chickadees,  Bluebirds,  and  Goldfinches  give  cheer, 
and  if  you  tie  some  bits  of  fat  meat  or  well-covered  bones  to 
the  branches  of  a  tree  in  a  sheltered  spot  you  will  be  sur- 
prised at  the  number  of  visitors  that  will  come  to  dine. 

With  February  the  days  begin  to  lengthen  visibly,  and  a 
reaction  sets  in.  There  is  a  return  movement  among  the 
Robins,  who  have  gone  but  a  short  distance  southward,  and 
the  Buntings  travel  in  large  flocks.  Late  in  the  month  a 
thaw  brings  the  Kingfisher  back,  and  at  any  time  you  may 
expect  to  hear  the  Song  Sparrow  in  his  old  haunts,  —  in  fact, 
you  may  have  heard  him  early  in  the  month,  or  in  January 
even,  but  now  it  is  his  spring  song,  only  needing  companion-

ship  and  the  mellowing  effects  of  mild  weather  to  bring  it  to 
perfection. 

The  Snow  Owls  are  thinking  of  going  northward,  unless 
barred  by  an  early  March  storm,  and  the  Meadowlarks 
that  have  braved  the  winter  sing  a  full  month  before  the 
migrating  flocks  arrive.  When  March  comes  in,  even  if 
it  does  roar  like  a  lion,  a  single  day  may  change  the  charac- 
ter of  the  bird  life  about  you  and  you  will  imagine  that  the 
Snow  Owls,  Shrikes,  Pine  Finches,  and  Horned  Larks  are 
under  orders  to  vanish  before  the  spring  flocks  of  Fox  Spar- 
rows, Robins,  and  Bluebirds  can  appear.  But  when  March 
comes  the  ear  is  listening  for  the  Spring  Song  and  the  win- 
ter-birds are  quickly  forgotten,  unless  you  happen  to  have  a 
stuffed  Owl  to  preside  in  solemn  silence  in  your  library,  per- 
forming its  mission  of  looking  wise  quite  as  well  as  a  piece 
of  bric-a-brac  as  it  did  in  life.  Is  not  the  Owl's  general 
immobility  the  reason  why  it  was  chosen  for  the  pet  of  the 
Goddess  of  Wisdom  ?  Doubtless  her  ancient  ladyship  knew 
that  her  protege  would  never  take  the  trouble  to  contradict 
her  and  never  express  a  decided  opinion,  and  thus  would 
pass  for  the  incarnation  of  knowledge. 

Winter  is  the  only  season  when  you  may  point  a  gun  at  a 
bird,  and  then  never  at  a  Song-bird,  but  you  may  do  these  a 
favour  by  shooting  some  of  their  enemies,  the  bad  English 
Sparrows,  and  one  or  two  Hawks  and  Owls.  Yet  you  must 
spare  both  Hawks  and  Owls  with  these  exceptions,  since  Dr. 
A.  K.  Fisher  has  given  conclusive  evidence  of  their  value  to 
agriculture. 

Never  shoot  even  a  Game-bird,  or  Wild  Duck,  merely  for 
the  sake  of  killing,  and  remember  when  on  the  bird-quest  to 
keep  your  hands  free  from  all  destruction  of  life,  so  that  you 
may  answer  in  the  affirmative  the  question,  — 

"  Hast  thou  named  all  the  birds  without  a  gun  ?  "

HOW  TO   NAME   THE  BIRDS. 


In  studying  the  birds  as  you  see  them  about  you,  try  to 
acquire  the  habit  of  gauging  the  size,  general  colour,  and 
poise  at  a  glance,  gaining  the  details,  if  possible,  afterward. 
Impress  upon  yourself  the  location  in  which  you  saw  the 
bird,  its  occupation,  its  method  of  feeding,  whether,  if  upon 
the  ground,  it  walked  or  hopped.  Was  it  dashing  through 
the  air  or  skimming  low  over  the  meadows,  uttering  a  twit- 
tering cry  and  turning  and  curving  sharply  as  it  caught 
insects  in  its  wide  mouth  ?  If  so,  you  must  look  for  it  in 
the  Swallow  Family. 

Was  it  a  brown  or  olive-backed  bird  somewhat  of  the 
build  of  the  Eobin  but  smaller,  with  a  light-coloured  breast 
more  or  less  speckled,  scratching  among  the  bushes  for  the 
insects  upon  which  it  feeds  ?  You  must  look  for  it  in  the 
Thrush  Family,  and  if  you  do  not  place  it  there  search 
among  the  Ground  Warblers.  Or  was  it  a  tiny  olive- 
gray  bird  that  caught  your  eye  as  it  peeped  about  the  twigs 
of  the  orchard  trees  in  the  autumn,  turning  its  head  and 
looking  at  you  sidewise,  showing  every  now  and  then  its 
gold  and  scarlet  crest?  Then  you  must  look  among  the 
Kinglets. 

If  you  keep  a  note-book  and  pencil  in  your  pocket  when 
you  are  on  the  bird-quest,  many  particulars  can  be  jotted 
down  to  refresh  your  memory  when  consulting  the  reference 
book.  In  rapidly  gauging  the  size  of  a  particular  bird  do 
not  think  in  inches,  but  compare  it  mentally  with  some  bird 
that  is  familiar  to  you.  Say  to  yourself.  Is  it  as  large  as  a 
Eobin,  a  Bluebird,  or  a  Chippy  ?

HOW  TO  NAME  THE  BIRDS. 

Bead  the  Synopsis  of  Bird  Families  ^  to  gain  an  idea  of 
their  groupings,  and  if  you  fail  to  locate  your  bird  in  this 
way  go  through  the  Key  ^  very  slowly,  not  jumping  hastily 
at  conclusions,  but  following  every  reasonable  clue.  It  is  im- 
possible to  make  such  a  key  absolutely  trustworthy,  when 
it  is  necessarily  based  upon  the  more  superficial  qualities, 
and  is  arranged  to  guide  those  who  rely  upon  impressions 
of  colour  gained  from  a  bird,  perhaps  many  feet  distant. 

In  condensing  the  attributes  of  each  bird  into  a  reference 
table  to  precede  its  biography,  its  length  in  inches  is  given 
as  a  means  of  comparison,  especially  in  referring  to  the 
illustrations ;  for  in  adapting  the  bird  portraits  from  many 
sources  it  has  been  impossible  to  grade  them  according  to  a 
mathematical  scale.  In  these  tables  I  have  endeavoured  to 
give  only  such  broad  descriptions  of  plumage  as  shall  be 
recognizable  with  a  field-glass,  noting  the  difference  in  colour- 
ing between  male  and  female  when  it  is  at  all  marked, 
and  giving  when  possible  the  accentuated  value  of  the  song 
and  call  notes  in  syllables.  Not  that  any  literal  meaning 
may  be  attributed  to  them,  but  that  the  sound  of  these 
syllables,  when  repeated  aloud,  may  aid  in  identifying  the 
song  with  the  singer.  Critics  who  do  not  understand  the 
motive  of  this  syllabication,  call  it  nonsense,  and  consider 
it  merely  a  sentimentalist's  attempt  to  make  the  birds  talk. 
I  only  know  that  it  has  been  a  great  help  to  me,  and  that 
:t  has  aided  many  people  who  depend  even  more  upon  the 
ear  than  the  eye  in  their  study  of  birds.  Thoreau  and 
Emerson  understood  it  thoroughly,  and  Burroughs  has 
formulated  much  of  the  language,  so  that  it  does  not  lack 
champions. 

The  seasons  of  bird  migration,  or  residence,  are  in  accord- 
ance with  records  of  this  part  of  New  England  (southern 
Connecticut),  both  from  the  notes  of  Eev.  James  Linsley, 
Mr.  C.  K.  Averill  of  Bridgeport,  and  others,  and  also  from 
my  own  diaries.  Allowance  must  therefore  be  made  by 
those  living  further  north  or  south,  as  in  the  spring  migra- 
tion birds  will  arrive  in  Delaware  two  weeks  earlier  than  in

Connecticut,  and  in  Maine  not  for  a  week  or  two  later.  The 
breeding-haunts  are  indicated,  and  the  nest  and  eggs  men- 
tioned, when  they  are  either  accessible  to  the  student,  or, 
when  belonging  to  northern  latitudes,  of  special  interest. 
The  range  of  the  bird  for  the  year  is  taken  from  the  Check- 
list of  the  American  Ornithologists'  Union,  which  is  the 
acknowledged  authority.  The  nomenclature  is  also  that  of 
the  A.  0.  U.  Check-list,  the  first  English  name  and  the 
Latin  title  being  according  to  its  tenets.  In  some  cases  I 
have  added  one  or  more  English  names,  because  they  are 
universally  understood  and  are  more  or  less  used  in  the 
manuals  and  state  publications. 

In  modern  science,  classification  follows  the  method  of 
natural  evolution,  grading  from  the  lowest  forms  to  the 
highest.  Under  this  system  the  Diving  Water-birds  should 
head  the  list,  and  the  Thrush  Family  of  Song-birds  end  it. 
Some  time  ago  a  different  system  obtained,  that  of  beginning 
with  the  highest  orders  and  descending  in  the  scale,  and 
the  birds  in  this  book  are  so  arranged.  The  reason  for  doing 
this  is  that  it  presents  the  Song-birds  first,  and  it  is  to  these 
that  you  will  be  first  attracted,  and,  finding  many  of  them 
familiar,  you  will  be  led  by  easy  stages  to  the  Birds  of  Prey 
and  the  Water-birds,  which  probably  you  have  had  less 
chance  to  know.  If,  however,  you  prefer  to  habituate  your- 
self to  the  more  modern  method,  all  that  you  have  to  do  is 
to  begin  at  the  end  of  the  book  and  work  backward. 

The  two  hundred  birds  chosen  for  description  from  the 
A.  O.  U.  list  of  over  nine  hundred  species  of  North  Ameri- 
can Birds  are  selected  as  being  those  which  will  be  the  most 
likely  to  interest  bird-lovers  living  in  the  temperate  parts 
of  the  country,  and  especially  in  the  Middle  and  Eastern 
States.  If  birds  are  included  that  are  rarer  (in  other  locali- 
ties) than  species  that  are  omitted,  it  is  owing  to  marked 
characteristics  or  some  interesting  traits  of  the  particular 
birds. 

The  mazes,  of  classification  are  omitted.  As  a  novice  who 
wishes  to  recognize  the  birds  by  sight,  you  have  no  need  of 
their  services  beyond  learning  the  English  and  Latin  names 

37 


HOW  TO  NAME  THE  BIRDS. 

of  the  birds,  and  that  of  the  order  and  family  to  which  they 
belong;  then  you  must  buy  a  good  manual  to  answer  all 
further  queries,  either  Eidgway's,^  Coues's,^  or  Chapman's  ^ 
will  serve  your  purpose.  Kidgway's  follows  the  modern 
method,  Coues's  is  both  modern  and  charming,  Chapman's  is 
both  modern,  simple,  and  comprehensive .  It  is  the  same  as 
when  beginning  the  study  of  history :  you  first  wish  to  learn 
the  name  of  a  character,  for  what  he  was  famous,  and  how  he 
appeared ;  then  with  a  distinct  realization  of  the  man's  per- 
sonality in  your  mind,  you  take  an  interest  which,  at  first, 
would  have  been  impossible,  in  looking  into  his  ancestry, 
and  finding  precisely  what  union  of  races  and  families  pro- 
duced his  particular  type. 

Inverted  evolution,  or  working  from  effect  to  cause,  is  the 
simplest  way  to  interest  popular  attention  in  any  branch  of 
science.  If  people  accept  a  tangible  fact  and  go  no  further, 
they  have  at  least  gained  some  information ;  if  they  possess 
the  thinking-faculty,  and  desire  to  find  the  causes,  they 
are  one  step  on  the  right  road.  Of  course  this  method,  if 
method  it  can  be  called,  lies  open  to  the  charge  of  superfici- 
ality, and  to  the  saying  that  "  when  science  and  sentiment 
meet,  sentiment  loses  its  case."  There  is,  of  course,  a  species 
of  maudlin  sentiment  that  is  the  proverbial  cloak  of  inaccu- 
racy, the  variety  that  weaves  touching  but  perfectly  im- 
possible tales  and  fables  about  natural  facts.  This  is  the 
sentiment  that  originated  the  story  of  the  self-sacrifice  of 
the  Pelican  in  feeding  its  young  from  the  blood  of  its  own 
breast.  Whereas  the  Pelican  belongs  to  a  class  of  birds 
who,  after  taking  their  food  into  the  crop  and  partly  digest- 
ing it,  bring  it  up  again  to  feed  their  offspring.  The  act  of 
pressing  the  bill  against  the  distended  crop  to  dislodge  the 
food,  sometimes  irritates  the  skin ;  hence  the  conclusion  was 
drawn  that  it  drew  its  own  blood.

HOW  TO  NAME  THE  BIRDS. 

There  may  be  also  in  the  study  of  birds  a  sentiment  that 
is  born  of  fact  and  accuracy,  provable  by  all  scientific  re- 
quirements, which  will  render  the  bird-quest  a  recreation, 
and  not  a  mental  discipline;  being  a  bridge  where  those 
who  can  go  no  further,  may  rest  and  enjoy  intelligently  the 
beauty  and  music  of  the  bird  world.  Of  course  a  little 
learning  may  be  a  dangerous  thing,  but  it  is  only  so  when 
we  overestimate  the  extent  of  our  limited  scope,  and  try  to 
speak  a  language  of  which  we  only  know  the  alphabet. 

Nature  is  to  be  studied  with  the  eyes  of  the  heart,  as  well 
as  of  the  microscope,  and  ever  so  scanty  a  knowledge  of  our 
feathered  brothers  helps  us  to  feel  that  the  realms  of  Nature 
are  very  near  to  the  human  heart  and  its  sympathies,  and 
that  "  the  truth  of  Nature  is  a  part  of  the  truth  of  God :  to 
him  who  does  not  search  it  out,  darkness ;  to  him  who  does, 
infinity."

ORDER  PASSERES:    PERCHING  BIRDS. 

SUB-ORDER  OSCINES:    SINGING  BIRDS. 

The  birds  of  this  Order  have  the  most  highly  complex 
vocal  organs,  the  term  Oscines  being  derived  from  the 
Latin,  signifying  those  birds  whose  songs  were  regarded  in 
past  times  as  augural. 

Family  Turdidae  :  Thnishea.     Page  57. 
7  Species.i 

Birds  of  moderate  size  and  stoutish  build,  bills  of  mod- 
erate length,  sexes  of  nearly  similar  plumage.  Melodious 
singers,  feeding  chiefly  on  the  ground.  The  American 
Kobin  and  the  Bluebird  belong  to  this  family.  The  true 
Thrushes  vary  through  browns  and  olives  on  the  back,  with 
light  breasts  more  or  less  spotted,  and  tails  that  are  wider 
at  the  tip  than  at  the  base.  Insectivorous  birds,  also  casual 
fruit-eaters.     Hoppers. 

Family  Sylviidse  :  Kinglets.  Page  68. 
2  Species. 
Very  small  insectivorous  birds,  feeding  in  the  trees. 
General  tone  of  plumage  olivaceous,  with  highly  coloured 
crown  patch.  Song,  during  the  spring  migration,  rich  and 
powerful  for  such  small  birds.  Seen  here  only  in  autumn, 
winter,  and  early  spring.

SYNOPSIS   OF  BIRD  FAMILIES. 

Family  Paridae  :  Nuthatches  and  Titmice.  Page  71. 
4  Species. 
Birds  seen  creeping  conspicuously  about  tree  trunks, 
especially  in  autumn  and  winter,  frequently  walking  head 
downward.  The  Nuthatches  have  compactly  feathered 
bodies,  straight  bills,  are  varied  grayish  above,  with  some- 
what ruddy  breasts.  The  Titmice  are  alert,  sprightly  little 
birds,  with  gray,  white,  and  black  feathers,  one  having  a  crest 
and  the  other  a  black  cap  and  white  cheeks.  They  feed  also 
about  trees. 

Family  Certhiidae :   Creepers.     Page  75. 
1  Species. 
This  bird  is  slender,  with  a  long,  sharp  bill,  much  mottled, 
brownish  plumage  and   a  long  tail.     It  is   seen  creeping 
spirally  about  trees  in  fall  and  winter. 

Family  Troglodytidae :  Wrens,  Thrasher,  Catbird,  etc.    Page  76. 

8  Species. 

Insectivorous  birds  and  highly  accomplished  singers. 
The  Wrens  are  all  small,  and  more  or  less  barred  and  washed 
with  browns,  while  the  tail  is  usually  held  erect.  The 
Catbird  (which  really  belongs  to  a  sub-family)  is  dark  slate 
with  a  black  cap,  the  Mockingbird  gray  and  olive,  and  the 
Thrasher  is  like  a  great  red-brown  Thrush  with  speckled 
breast,  and  a  long  tail  with  which  he  continually  beats  the 
air. 

Family  Motacillidae  :   Pipits,  etc.     Page  87. 
1  Species. 

American  Pipit,  Titlark.  Brownish  bird,  with  long,  pointed 
wings,  slender  bill,  and  outer  tail-feathers  white;  seen  in 
stubble  fields  as  a  migrant  in  late  fall  and  spring.  Peculiar, 
wavering  flight.

unnamed  by  people  in  general.  These  Warblers  inhabit 
the  woods,  feeding  among  the  trees,  or,  in  some  species, 
upon  the  ground.  They  comprise  both  migrants  and  sum- 
mer residents ;  of  small  size,  bills  slender,  shorter  than  the 
head,  wings  pointed  and  usually  shorter  than  the  tail.  All 
but  a  few  Ground  Warblers  have  brightly  coloured  or  much 
varied  plumage,  ranging  through  all  shades  of  olive,  yel- 
low, red,  orange,  brown,  and  black.  They  have  sweet,  lisp- 
ing songs,  which  are  neither  full  nor  varied.  The  well-known 
Yellow  Warbler  belongs  to  this  class ;  also  the  Black  and 
White  Warbler.  The  exceptions  to  this  rule  are  the  Oven- 
bird,  Water  Thrush,  and  the  Louisiana  Water  Thrush,  which 
are  Ground  Warblers,  having  sober.  Thrush-like  plumage 
and  exquisite  voices,  and  the  Chat,  which  has  brilliant 
green  and  gold  plumage  and  a  clear,  loud  voice,  mocking 
and  whistling  by  turns. 

Family  Vlreonldae :  Vireos.    Page  116. 

5  Species. 

Birds  of  small  size,  bills  hooked  at  tip  —  shorter  than 
the  head.  Sexes  alike  in  colouring ;  the  plumage  (remain- 
ing quite  constant  at  all  seasons)  is  generally  olivaceous 
above  and  whitish  or  yellow  below.  One  species  has  red 
and  one  white  eyes.  All  are  musical  and  persistent  singers 
of  a  colloquial  type,  feeding  and  singing  in  orchard  or  forest 
trees,  according  to  the  species.  A  family  easily  confused 
with  the  Warblers,  unless  its  superior  vocal  abilities  are 
remembered. 

Family  Laniidas  :   Shrikes.    Page  122. 

1  Species. 

Carnivorous  birds,  bold,  handsome,  and  quarrelsome,  bills 
sharply  hooked  at  end ;  general  colour  gray  and  black,  bris- 
tles at  nostrils,  and  muscular  feet.  In  winter  and  early 
spring  they  may  be  seen  perching  in  the  bare  trees,  where 
they  are  on  the  watch  for  small  birds,  upon  which  they  prey,

Birds  of  the  air  in  the  fullest  sense.  "  Bill  flat,  broad, 
triangular."  Mouth  opening  to  below  the  eyes ;  long,  strong 
wings,  small  feet,  which  are  seldom  used ;  broad  head  and 
stout  neck ;  the  tail  more  or  less  forked.  Sexes  similar ; 
song,  a  pleasant,  twittering  warble.  The  plumage  in  some 
species  is  dull,  but  in  others  beautifully  iridescent  above 
and  ruddy  below.  All  insectivorous  birds  and  summer 
residents. 

Family  Tanagridae  :  Tanagers.    Page  131. 
1  Species. 

A  brilliantly  coloured  family  undergoing  great  changes  of 
plumage  during  the  year,  the  colours  of  the  sexes  being 
wholly  different,  the  males  having  much  red  about  them. 
Bill  short,  the  long,  pointed  wings  exceeding  the  tail  in 
length. 

Family  Fringillidae :  Finches,  Sparrows,  etc.    Page  133. 

28  Species. 

The  largest  family  of  North  American  Birds,  comprising 
one-seventh  of  all  our  birds.  These  birds  are  true  seed- 
eaters,  though  they  feed  their  young  largely  on  an  insectiv- 
orous diet. 

"The  bill  approaches  nearest  the  ideal  cone,  combining 
strength  to  crush  seeds  with  delicacy  of  touch  to  secure 
minute  objects."  (Dr.  Coues.)  The  family  contains  birds 
of  every  size  and  colour,  sexes  either  similar  or  unlike, — 
Finches,  Buntings,  Linnets,  Grosbeaks,  Crossbills,  and  Spar- 
rows, whose  traits  it  is  impossible  to  describe  in  general  terms,

Bobolink,  and  Cowbird.  Sexes  unlike.  All  species  but  the 
Orioles  have  large,  muscular  feet  adapted  to  walking,  and 
feed  on  or  near  the  ground.  They  are  both  seed  and  insect 
eaters,  and  vary  much  in  size  and  colour.  The  predominat- 
ing hues  are  black,  white,  orange-red,  and  what  Dr.  Coues 
calls  a  "niggled  pattern"  of  brown  in  the  Meadowlark. 
Musically  the  species  are  divided,  half  being  highly  vocal 
and  half  casually  so. 

Family  Corvidae  :   Crows,  Jays,  etc.    Page  177. 
3  Species. 

The  Crows  are  large  black  birds,  having  bills  as  long 
as  the  head,  stout  feet  suitable  for  walking,  pointed  wings 
longer  than  the  tail,  appearing  saw-toothed  in  flight.  Gre- 
garious ;  sexes  alike.  The  Jays  are  a  great  contrast  to  the 
Crows,  being  crested  and  having  conspicuous  plumage  in 
which  blue  predominates.  Both  Crows  and  Jays  are  partly 
carnivorous,  and  though  having  harsh  voices,  moderate  them 
to  a  not  unpleasing  song  in  the  breeding  season. 

Family  Alaudidae  :  Larks.  Page  180. 
1  Species. 
True  Larks,  kin  of  the  European  Skylark,  and  not  to  be 
confused  with  Meadowlarks  or  Titlarks.  Our  species,  a 
Shore  Lark,  seen  here  only  in  the  fall  and  winter,  is  highly 
musical  in  the  breeding-season.  It  has  very  long,  straight 
hind  claws,  long,  pointed  wings,  and  two  slender,  feathered 
ear  tufts  that  give  it  the  name  of  Horned  Lark. 

SUB-ORDER  CLAMATORES:    SONGLESS  PERCHING  BIRDS.

sharp  point,  and  large  mouths.  Colouring  ranging  from 
brown  to  olive-gray,  with  yellow  washes  on  the  breast. 
Usually  having  harsh  voices,  one  or  two  species,  however, 
possessing  plaintive  call  notes.  To  be  distinguished  from 
other  birds  of  a  general,  similar  appearance,  who  pursue 
insects  upon  the  wing  by  the  "  habit  of  perching  in  wait  for 
their  prey  upon  some  prominent  outpost,  in  a  peculiar  atti- 
tude, with  the  wings  and  tail  drooped  and  vibrating  in  readi- 
ness for  instant  action ;  and  of  dashing  into  the  air,  seizing 
the  passing  insect  with  a  quick  movement  and  a  click  of  the 
bill,  and  then  returning  to  their  stand.'^     (Dr.  Coues.)

2  Species. 
Medium-sized,  heavy  birds  with  long  wings,  short,  thick 
heads  and  gaping,  bristly  mouths,  taking  their  insect  food 
on  the  wing  (the  Whip-poor-will  is  strictly  nocturnal  in

Birds  of  small  and  medium  size,  feeding  as  they  creep 
around  the  branches  and  trunks  of  trees.  They  are  of 
stocky,  compact  build,  with  strong,  straight  bills  (one  species 
has  a  slightly  curving  bill),  mottled  and  variegated  plumage, 
and  red  markings  about  the  head.  To  be  distinguished  from

Comprising  our  two  most  familiar  Game-birds,  the  Buffed 
Grouse  (Partridge)  and  the  Quail,  birds  with  mottled  feathers 
of  varied  browns,  the  Partridge  having  feathered  legs.  The

which  are  never  longer  than  the  head.  In  size  they  vary  from 
small  to  medium  (7  to  12  inches);  the  plumage  undergoes 
many  variations  owing  to  season  and  age,  but  the  sexes  are 
nearly  alike.  The  neck  is  short,  the  head  bullet-shaped,  and 
the  body  usually  stout ;  the  wings  are  longer  than  the  tail. 
They  are  generally  seen  in  flocks  during  the  migrations,  as 
the  majority  of  species  breed  far  north.  They  fly  and  run 
with  great  rapidity,  and  inhabit  dry  uplands,  as  well  as  the 
vicinity  of  ponds,  and  the  seashore.  They  all  have  pleasing 
call  notes,  and  one  species  has  a  melodious,  piping  whistle. 

Family  Scolopacidae  :  Sandpipers,  Snipes,  etc.    Page  236. 
11  Species. 

Another  large  family,  inhabiting  inland  meadows  as 
well  as  salt  marshes  and  the  seashore,  including  Wood- 
cock and  Snipe,  both  well-known  Game-birds  (that  probe 
for  their  food  in  the  mud  with  their  bills),  and  the  less 
familiar  Sandpipers.  Bills  not  Pigeon-shaped;  slender ^  usu- 
ally longer  than  the  head.  Plumage  mottled  and  streaked 
with  neutral  tints  and  sober  colours.  Voices  peculiar,  vary- 
ing according  to  the  species. 

Snipe  are  among  the  most  delicately  flavoured  of  Game- 
birds,  and  Sandpipers  comprise  the  smallest  of  the  Waders. 
The  Snipe  group  may  be  easily  distinguished  from  the 
rest  by  the  plain,  unbarred  tail.  The  Tattlers  are  a  long- 
legged,  noisy  species,  not  probing  for  their  food  in  the  mud, 
but  picking  it  up  in  the  vicinity  of  flats  and  sand  bars.

Their  voices  are  harsh,  and  they  undergo  great  changes  of 
plumage,  and  must  be  recognized  by  the  novice  more  by 
general  shape  than  detailed  colour  description.  They  may

1  Species. 

The  various  Petrels  are  comprised  in  tMs  family ;  they 
are  off-shore  birds  of  Gull-like  appearance.  Dr.  Coues  says 
of  one  group,  that  their  "  flight  is  peculiarly  airy  and  flicker- 
ing, more  like  that  of  a  butterfly  than  like  ordinary  birds ; 
they  are  almost  always  seen  on  the  wing,  appearing  to  swim 
little  if  any,  and  some,  if  not  all,  breed  in  holes  in  the 
ground  like  Bank  Swallows." 

ORDER   LONGIPENNES:   LONGK-WINGED   SWIMMERS. 

Family  Laridae  :  Gulls  and  Terns.     Page  269. 

7  Species. 

Off-shore  birds,  breeding  on  the  coastwise  islands.  The 
Gulls  are  large  and  stout,  with  hooked  bills,  large  feet,  and 
strong  wings  that  make  their  flight  even  and  steady,  and 
not  impulsive  and  dashing  like  the  Terns'.  They  both  dive 
for  their  food  and  glean  it  from  the  surface  of  the  water. 
The  Terns  are  more  slender,  have  greater  rapidity  in  flying, 
SiTid  forked  tails;  the  tails  of  the  Gulls  are  never  forked.

Wood  Thrush:    Turdus  mustelinus. 

Plate  6.     Fig.  2. 

Length :  7.50-8  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  tawny,  deepest  on  head,  tail  olivaceous.  Sides 
of  throat  light  buff,  middle  of  throat,  breast,  and  belly  white ; 
sprinkled  on  sides  with  heart-shaped  or  triangular  dark-brown 
spots.     Whitish  eye  ring,  bill  dark  brown,  feet  flesh-coloured. 

Song :  A  melody  in  which  some  notes  have  the  effect  of  a  stringed 
accompaniment.  The  syllables  are  uttered  deliberately,  about 
four  seconds  apart — "  Uoli — a-e-o-li,  uoli— uoli — uol — aeolee- 
le6!" 

Season :  Early  May  to  October. 

Breeds :  Northward  from  Virginia,  Kentucky,  and  Kansas. 

Nest :  Of  small  twigs  with  a  mud  lining,  sometimes  saddled  upon  the 
boughs  of  evergreens  not  far  from  the  trunk,  or  in  small  trees 
and  bushes. 

Eggs :  Four  usually,  similar  in  colour  to  the  Robin's,  but  smaller. 

JRange :  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  north  to  southern  Michi- 
gan, Ontario,  and  Massachusetts,  south  in  winter  to  Guatemala 
and  Cuba. 

Next  to  the  American  Robin,  the  Wood  Thrush  is  the 
most  widely  known  of  its  tribe.  He  is  an  exquisite  vocalist, 
the  tones  having  a  rare  quality  of  rolling  vibrance,  and 
often  as  he  utters  his  placid  notes,  each  one  full  and  delib- 
erate, the  song  seems  like  the  music  of  a  flute  and  an

seolian  harp  strung  in  the  trees.  "Uoli,"  he  begins,  and 
after  pausing  continues,  "Aeolee-lee"  (the  last  syllable 
having  the  harp  quality),  "Uoli-uoli — aeolee-lee."  First 
softly,  then  modulating,  reiterating  sometimes  for  an  hour 
together ;  but  compassing  in  these  few  syllables  the  whole 
range  of  pure  emotion. 

The  Wood  Thrush  is  called  shy  by  many  writers,  but 
here  in  Connecticut  it  is  both  abundant  and  sociable,  feed- 
ing about  the  lawn  in  company  with  Eobins,  though  it  keeps 
more  in  shelter,  skirting  the  shrubbery,  as  it  scratches. 
Two  pairs  nested  last  season  in  the  spruces  below  the 
lawn.  Their  nests  so  closely  resemble  the  best  efforts  of 
the  Robin,  and  the  eggs  being  of  a  like  colour,  that  I  had 
mistaken  them  until  I  saw  the  Thrushes  in  possession. 
These  nests  were  made  wholly  of  sticks,  and  lined  thinly 
with  clay,  but  two  others  that  I  found  in  the  woods  showed 
more  varied  materials.  One  was  placed,  some  six  feet  from 
the  ground,  in  a  cedar  bush  close  to  a  pool.  The  mud  used 
to  line  the  nest  was  full  of  Sphagnum,  and  of  the  water- 
soaked  seed  vessels  of  the  sweet-pepper  bush,  which,  min- 
gled with  dry  beech  leaves,  made  the  nest  very  picturesque, 
while  the  mud  was  barely  visible  through  the  bedding  of 
the  runners  of  Potentilla,  to  whose  stems  some  identifying 
leaves  still  clung. 

The  second  nest  was  in  a  laurel  bush  on  the  top  of  high 
rocks  in  Samp-Mortar  woods.  It  was  beautifully  stuccoed 
with  lichens  and  lined  with  the  hair-like  roots  that  cover 
the  surface  of  leaf  mould. 

The  Wood  Thrush  builds  the  middle  or  last  of  May,  and 
as  it  comes  often  the  very  first  day  of  the  month  and  con- 
tinues singing  well  into  July,  it  gives  us  a  goodly  season  of 
song.  Wood  Eobin  is  one  of  its  local  names,  but  this  is 
used,  somewhat  at  random,  for  other  Thrushes.

Length:  7-7.50  inches.

shaped  brown  spots.     Breast  and  under  parts  white.    Bill  dark 

above,  lower  mandible  light.     Feet  light. 
Song:  Ringing,   echo-like.     Professor   Ridgway  indicates   it  thus: 

"Taweel  'ah— taweel  'ah,  twil-ah,  twil-ah  ! " 
Season :  Early  May  to  October. 
Breeds :  According  to  Coues,  in  the  northerly  part  of  its  range,  but  it 

also  breeds  freely  in  our  river  groves  and  in  the  more  southern 

portion  of  the  Middle  States. 
Nest :  Built  either  upon  or  near  the  ground,  of  sticks  and  twigs  like 

that  of  the  Wood  Thrush,  but  lacking  the  mud. 
Eggs :  Like  Robin  and  Wood  Thrush,  of  a  greenish  blue,  but  smaller 

than  either. 
Bange:  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  north  to  Manitoba, 

Ontario,  Anticosti,  and  Newfoundland. 

The  Veery,  the  most  slender  and  graceful  of  the  Thrushes, 
is  with  us  all  the  season,  but  it  is  so  shy  and  elusive  in  its 
ways  of  slipping  through  the  trees  and  underbrush  in 
swampy  woodlands  that  it  seems  scarcely  an  actual  pres- 
ence. Change  a  word  in  Wordsworth's  verses  on  the  Cuckoo 
and  the  description  is  perfect :  — 

"  O  Veery  !  shall  I  call  thee  bird, 
Or  but  a  wandering  voice  ?  " 

When  it  first  arrives,  and  before  mating,  the  Veery  is  seen 
frequently  in  the  garden,  prying  under  dead  leaves  and  in 
low  bushes  like  all  its  insect-eating  kin,  but  when  it  retires 
to  the  woods  to  nest  all  but  the  voice  seems  to  vanish.  That 
wonderful,  haunting  voice !  It  was  a  woodland  mystery  to 
me  not  so  very  long  ago ;  a  vocal  Will-o'-the-Wisp.  Lead- 
ing on  and  on,  up  and  down  river  banks,  into  wild  grape 
tangles  and  clinging  brush,  then  suddenly  ceasing  and  leav- 
ing me  to  return  as  best  I  might. 

There  came  a  time,  however,  when  a  few  pairs,  mating 
before  they  left  the  garden  in  the  spring,  surprised  us  by 
singing  while  in  view,  and  the  same  season  we  took  a  leis- 
urely drive  through  the  country  to  see  the  orchards  in  bloom, 
and  stopped  for  the  night  at  a  hospitable  farmhouse  in  a 
hollow  that  winds  between  banks  clad  with  laurel  and  hem- 
locks up  to  the  old  village  of  Kedding  Kidge.

Thnishea  SONG-BIRDS. 

We  were  told  that  the  woods  were  full  of  birds  "  that  sang 
all  night,"  so  we  walked  up  the  lane  road,  the  soft  light 
coming  partly  from  the  setting  sun  and  partly  from  the  high 
May  moon. 

The  waterfall  resounded  from  where  the  hills  dropped 
suddenly  to  the  hollow.  A  single  Whip-poor-will  darting 
from  the  woods  almost  brushed  my  face  and  uttered  his 
mournful  call  in  my  ear.  Above  the  waterfall  was  a  chain 
of  ponds,  and  sitting  on  the  rail  of  a  separating  bridge  we 
listened  and  waited.  A  fox  crept  down  to  the  water  to 
drink,  and  as  the  wind  blew  toward  us  he  did  not  suspect 
our  proximity  and  lapped  at  leisure,  the  clear  moonlight 
showing  his  shabby,  faded  spring  coat. 

Suddenly  from  the  woody  banks  the  Yeeries  began  their 
song.  They  had  been  singing  by  twos  and  threes  ever  since 
sunset,  but  now  the  sound  was  as  of  a  full  chorus  compared 
to  the  humming  of  a  few  voices.  From  all  sides  the  notes 
rang :  "  Taweel  ^ah,  taweel  ^ah !  "  and  then  a  tone  lower  ; 
•'  twil-ah,  twil-ah !  "  no  two  birds  seeming  to  sing  precisely 
at  once  but  continually  echoed  themselves  and  each  other. 
Why  is  not  this  bird  called  the  Echo  Thrush  ?  The  name 
would  reveal  its  identity  to  any  one  who  had  ever  heard  the 
song. 

The  music  lasted  until  after  nine  o'clock,  when  it  died 
away  in  a  whisper  like  a  benediction  of  the  night  and  the 
Whip-poor-will  was  left  as  sentry  for  the  midnight  hours.

Bange :  Eastern  North  America,  west  to  the  Plains,  Alaska,  and  east- 
ern Siberia,  north  to  the  Arctic  coast,  south  in  winter  to  Costa 
Rica. 

This  Thrush  is  one  of  the  rarest  in  southern  New  Eng- 
land. It  is  a  near  relative  of  the  Olive-backed  Thrush, 
from  which  it  differs  in  having  gray  sides  to  the  head  and 
in  being  somewhat  larger.  A  few  of  the  Gray-cheeked 
Thrushes  come  to  the  garden  and  lane  every  spring  and  fall ; 
but  even  these  migratory  visits  are  very  irregular.  Brad- 
ford Torrey,  whose  White  Mountain  experience  has  brought 
him  into  intimate  contact  with  Bicknell's  Thrush  (as  those 
individuals  which  breed  in  the  mountains  of  New  York  and 
New  England  are  called)  during  its  season  of  song,  says 
that  "...  while  the  Gray -cheek's  song  bears  an  evident 
resemblance  to  the  Veery's,  .  .  .  the  two  are  so  unlike  in 
pitch  and  rhythm  that  no  reasonably  nice  ear  ought  ever 
to  confound  them." 

The  song  is  one  of  the  most  infrequent  sounds  in  this 
locality ;  but  I  have  heard  it  three  times  in  the  lane,  and 
have  come  within  identifying  range  of  the  singer,  attracted 
and  aided  by  Mr.  Torrey's  description  and  syllabication.^ 

Olive-backed  Thrush:  Turdus  ustulatus  swainsonu 

Plate  7. 

Zengri^;  7-7.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Yellowish  eye  ring.  Head  and  back  olive-brown, 
deepest  on  wings  and  tail.  Buff  breast  and  throat,  deepening  in 
colour  on  the  sides  and  speckled  everywhere  but  on  the  throat 
with  arrow-shaped  blackish  spots.     Dark  bill ;  feet  pale  brown. 

Song :  Of  the  same  quality  as  the  Wood  Thrush's,  but  less  inspiring, 
and  tinged  with  melancholy. 

Season :  Arrives  in  May,  often  in  company  with  White-throated  Spar- 
rows, passes  on  in  early  May,  and  returns  in  October. 

Breeds :  In  mountainous  parts  of  southern  New  England  and  north- 
ward. 

Xest :  In  low  trees  and  bushes,  like  that  of  Wood  Thrush  minus  the  mud. 

Bggs :  4-5,  greenish  blue,  freely  spotted  with  brown. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America  and  westward  to  the  upper  Columbia 
River  and  East  Humboldt  Mountains,  straggling  to  the  Pacific 
coast.

The  early  ornitliologists  were  rather  mixed  as  to  the 
identity  of  the  Hermit,  Gray-cheeked,  and  Olive-backed 
Thrushes.  Samuels  calls  the  latter  the  least  common  of 
New  England  Thrushes,  while  Nuttall  confused  the  Hermit 
with  the  Wood  Thrush. 

The  Olive-backed  Thrush  comes  quite  freely  to  the  gar- 
den, rather  early  in  the  spring  migration,  at  the  time  when 
the  other  migratory  Thrushes  and  northern-breeding  Spar- 
rows appear,  and  hops  about  quite  sociably,  but  seldom  gives 
any  other  sound  than  its  liquid  call  note.  Its  identification 
is  easy,  owing  to  the  even  olive  colour  of  its  back,  and  it 
entirely  lacks  the  tawny  warmth  of  its  kin.  This  colour 
difference  of  the  Thrushes  is  tritely  summed  up  on  page  60 
of  Stearns  &amp;  Coues's  "  New  England  Bird-life  "  :  "  The  Wood 
Thrush  is  tawny,  turning  to  olive  on  the  rump.  The  Her- 
mit is  olive,  turning  to  ta^vny  on  the  rump.  The  Olive-back 
is  entirely  olive.  The  Veery  is  entirely  tawny."  When 
seen  feeding  with  the  Wood  Thrush  along  the  garden  edges, 
this  colour  difference  appealed  to  me  very  plainly,  as  well 
as  the  greater  slimness  of  the  Olive-back. 

Mr.  Nehrling  says  that  this  Thrush,  in  company  with  the 
Veery  and  Wood  Thrush,  is  killed  in  great  hordes,  by  the 
miserable  pot-hunters  about  New  Orleans,  on  its  return  in 
the  fall  migration ;  so  that  even  sober  plumage  is  no  protec- 
tion, and  the  fact  that  our  country  is  not  wholly  birdless 
goes  far  to  prove  the  wonderful  power  that  Nature  uses  in 
her  struggle  with  the  destructive  side  of  man.

Breeds:  From  mountainous  parts  of  southern  New  York  and  New 

England  northward. 
Nest  and  Eggs :  Similar  to  those  of  the  Veery. 
Range :  Eastern  North  America,  wintering  from  the  Northern  States 

southward. 

Burroughs  says :  "  If  we  take  the  quality  of  melody  as  a 
test,  the  Wood  Thrush,  the  Hermit  Thrush,  and  the  Veery 
Thrush  stand  at  the  head  of  our  list  of  songsters."  One  may 
be  very  familiar  with  the  songs  of  two  of  this  trio  without 
ever  having  identified  the  third,  or  at  least  without  having 
heard  it  sing. 

At  the  first  glance  the  Hermit  closely  resembles  the  Wood 
Thrush,  but  a  good  field-glass  will  enable  you  to  see  the 
colour  distinction  of  the  back,  and  also  that  the  Hermit  has 
a  more  yellowish  throat  and  that  the  breast  spots  are  more 
acute.  Its  rarity  differs  very  much  according  to  location. 
It  is  comparatively  common  in  the  northeast,  and  Dr.  Warren 
says  that  in  Pennsylvania  it  is,  with  the  exception  of  the 
Bobin,  the  commonest  of  the  Thrushes  and  breeds  occasion- 
ally in  some  of  the  higher  mountain  districts.  Here,  as  well 
as  in  many  of  the  Middle  States,  where  it  is  only  a  migrant, 
its  full  song  is  seldom  heard.  I  have  not  found  it  a  shy 
bird,  not  more  so  than  the  Wood  Thrush,  but  it  doubtless 
becomes  shy  in  its  breeding-haunts. 

I  made  its  acquaintance,  several  years  ago,  in  the  lane  back 
of  the  garden,  and  had  watched  its  rapid,  nervous  motions 
during  many  migrations  before  I  heard  it  sing.  This  spring, 
the  first  week  in  May,  when  standing  at  the  window  about 
six  o'clock  in  the  morning,  I  heard  an  unusual  note,  and 
listened,  thinking  it  at  first  a  Wood  Thrush  and  then  a 
Thrasher,  but  soon  finding  that  it  was  neither  of  these  I 
opened  the  window  softly  and  looked  among  the  nearby 
shrubs,  with  my  glass.  The  wonderful  melody  ascended 
gradually  in  the  scale  as  it  progressed,  now  trilling,  now 
legato,  the  most  perfect,  exalted,  unrestrained,  yet  withal, 
finished  bird  song  that  I  ever  heard.  At  the  final  note  I 
caught  sight  of  the  singer  perching  among  the  lower  sprays 
of  a  dogwood  tree.  I  could  see  him  perfectly :  it  was  the 
Hermit  Thrush!     In  a  moment  he  began  again.     I  have

never  heard  the  Nightingale,  but  those  who  have,  say  that 
it  is  the  surroundings  and  its  continuous  night  singing  that 
make  it  even  the  equal  of  our  Hermit ;  for,  while  the  Night- 
ingales sing  in  numbers  in  the  moonlit  groves,  the  Hermit 
tunes  his  lute  sometimes  in  inaccessible  solitudes,  and  there 
is  something  immaterial  and  immortal  about  the  song.  Pres- 
ently you  cease  altogether  to  associate  it  with  a  bird,  and  it 
inspires  a  kindred  feeling  in  every  one  who  hears  it. 

Mrs.  Olive  Thorne  Miller  tells  delightfully  of  her  pursuit 
of  the  Hermit  in  northern  New  York,  where  it  was  said  to 
be  abundant,  but  when  she  looked  for  him,  he  had  always 
**  been  there "  and  was  gone ;  until  one  day  in  August  she 
saw  the  bird  and  heard  the  song  and  exclaims :  "  This  only 
was  lacking.  .  .  .     This  crowns  my  summer."  ^ 

Among  many  local  names  this  bird  has  received,  that  given 
by  the  early  settlers  in  the  Adirondack  region  is  the  most 
appropriate  j  they  call  it  the  Swamp  Angel.

SONG-BIRDS.  Robin 

In  early  March  the  Kobins  come  flocking  from  the  South, 

and  those  seen  before  this  time  are  usually  the  roving 
winter  residents.  At  first  they  sing  most  freely  at  noon  or 
late  in  the  afternoon,  when  their  notes  mingle  with  the 
peeping  of  the  marsh-frogs,  but  with  milder  weather  the 
Eobin  becomes  the  bird  of  dawn,  whose  persistent,  regular 
melody  unites  the  whole  chorus. 

From  this  time  until  late  July,  at  morning  before  twilight 
and  at  intervals  all  through  the  day,  he  sings,  varjdng  the 
accentuation  of  the  melody,  even  while  its  range  remains  the 
same.  At  dawn  he  says,  "  Cheerily,  cheerily,  cheer  up,  cheer 
up !  "  While  one  who  sings  every  afternoon  in  the  apple 
tree  by  my  window  says  plainly,  "  Do  you  think  what  you 
do,  do  you  think  what  you  do,  do  you  thi-n-k  ?  " 

Wilson  riagg,  who  is  always  unique  if  sometimes  in- 
accurate, writes,  "There  is  no  bird  that  has  fewer  faults 
than  the  Eobin,  or  would  be  more  esteemed  as  a  constant 
companion.'^  Passing  over  his  habit  of  helping  himself  to 
the  ripest  cheek  of  cherry  or  strawberry,  which  is  a  trifling 
harm  when  compared  with  his  good  reputation  as  an  insect 
destroyer,  and  which  from  a  bird's  standpoint  of  course  is 
not  a  fault  at  all,  —  he  has  two  radical  defects  that  detract 
from  the  pleasure  of  his  society.  He  is  extremely  and 
unnecessarily  noisy  in  his  cries  of  alarm  when  any  one 
approaches  his  nest,  not  only  in  this  way  calling  attention 
to  its  location,  but  setting  the  entire  bird  colony  in  an 
uproar.  His  sharp,  useless  call,  given  vehemently,  often 
without  cause,  reminds  one  of  the  silly  housewife  who  ran 
down  the  village  street  crying,  "Tire!  Fire!" — because  the 
damper  being  closed,  her  stove  smoked. 

It  is  very  aggravating  to  be  thus  interrupted  while  watch- 
ing the  movements  of  some  rare  .or  shy  bird.  One  day  I  had 
almost  located  a  Hummingbird's  nest  when  a  Eobin  cried, 
"  Quick !  Quick ! "  and  the  Hummers  took  the  hint. 

His  other  fault  is  untidiness  and  general  disorder  in  nest- 
building.     If  Eobins  build  about  the  porch  or  in  an  arbour, 
they  invariably  make  a  litter  and  exercise  little  of  the  pre- 
caution, used  by  so  many  birds,  in  removing  the  excrements 
r  66

of  the  young  from  the  nest.  In  the  choice  of  a  nesting 
location  they  are  often  extremely  stupid.  The  nest  being 
a  combination  of  clay  and  sticks,  is  a  rather  bulky  and 
weighty  affair,  yet  the  birds  frequently  build  it  in  a  spot  so 
exposed  that  a  heavy  summer  shower  will  reduce  it  to  pulp ; 
or  on  so  slender  a  branch  that  the  weight  of  the  growing 
young  cause  it  to  tip  over. 

Twelve  pairs  of  Robins,  that  I  know  of,  nested  this 
season  in  various  parts  of  the  garden,  some  huddled  close 
to  the  house,  or  in  fruit  trees,  others  in  the  evergreens, 
but  in  addition  to  these  homes  I  found  five  nests,  some  con- 
taining eggs,  which,  though  of  the  season's  building,  had 
been  abandoned  through  hopeless  faults  of  location  and 
construction,  and  the  Robin  does  not  lightly  abandon  its 
nest  after  the  eggs  are  laid,  like  some  other  Thrushes  and 
many  Warblers. 

But  with  the  list  of  the  Robin's  shortcomings  before  us, 
the  cheery  sound  of  his  piping  effaces  them  all,  and 
awakens  memories  that  go  back  to  the  very  dawn  of  life. 
He  was  the  first  bird,  probably,  that  we  learned  to  call  by 
name,  and  every  spring  he  returns  as  the  marshal  of  the 
feathered  hosts  and  well  sustains  the  honour. 

The  American  Robin  is  an  entirely  different  species  from 
the  English  Robin  Redbreast ;  the  latter  is  a  smaller  bird 
of  more  compact  build,  with  a  brilliant  red  breast,  in  form 
resembling  our  Bluebird.

SONG-BIRDS.  Bluebird 

Breeds :  All  through  its  range. 

iVesf :  Hardly  to  be  called  a  structure  as  it  is  usually  merely  a  lining 

in  a  decayed  knot  hole,  a  bird-house,  or  the  abandoned  hole  of 

the  Woodpecker.

Hange:  Eastern   United  States  to  the  eastern  base  of   the  Rocky 

Mountains,  north  to  Manitoba,  Ontario,  and  Nova  Scotia ;  south 

in  winter,  from  the  Middle  States  to  the  Gulf  States  and  Cuba. 

Bermuda,  resident. 


The  Bluebird  is  the  colour-bearer  of  the  spring  brigade, 
even  as  the  Song  Sparrow  is  the  bugler.  There  may  be 
snow  on  the  ground,  and  the  chimney  nightly  tells  the  com- 
plaint of  the  wind.  All  other  signs  fail,  but  when  we  see 
the  Bluebird  in  his  azure  robe  and  hear  his  liquid  notes 
(he  is  April's  minstrel),  we  know  that  spring  is  close  at 
hand,  for  in  autumn  and  winter  the  blue  coat  is  veiled 
with  rusty-brown,  as  if  the  murky  storms  had  cast  their 
shadows  upon  it.  The  Bluebird's  note  is  pleasing  and 
mellow,  mingling  delightfully  with  the  general  spring 
chorus,  but  in  itself  it  ranks  more  with  the  music  of  the 
Warblers  than  with  its  own  Thrush  kin.  It  has  a  rather 
sad  tone,  a  trifle  suggestive  of  complaint  or  pity.  Heard  at 
a  distance  it  has  a  purling  quality.  Uttered  close  at  hand, 
as  when  the  birds  go  to  and  fro  about  their  nests,  it  sounds 
as  if  their  domestic  arrangements  were  being  discussed 
with  the  subdued,  melancholy  voice  so  often  assumed  by 
unwilling  housewives.  Then  the  male  will  fly  off  on  a 
marketing  expedition,  murmuring  to  himself,  "Dear,  dear, 
think  of  it,  think  of  it ! "  In  fact,  these  birds  seem  to  be 
practical,  every-day  sort  of  little  creatures,  and  very  seldom 
exhibit  any  tokens  of  affection  after  the  nesting  season 
begins.  Yet  the  Bluebird  is  one  to  which  romance  strongly 
attaches  us,  its  notes  recall  the  first  thrill  of  early  spring, 
and  we  cannot  disassociate  him  from  blooming  orchards. 
In  the  autumn  he  is  one  of  the  latest  to  call  to  us,  the  last 
leaf  (so  to  speak)  on  the  tree  of  beautifully  coloured  Song- 
birds, from  which  the  Oriole,  Tanager,  Rose-breasted  Gros- 
beak, and  Cardinal  have  dropped  away.

One  of  the  finest  bird  eulogies  in  any  language  is  Bur- 
roughs's  chapter  on  this  bird  in  "Wake  Robin"  ;  it  has  even 
a  greater  charm  than  Michelet's  rhapsody  on  the  Nightingale. 
One  paragraph  quoted  will  lead  the  reader  to  search  out  the 
whole. 

"  When  Nature  made  the  Bluebird  she  wished  to  propi- 
tiate both  the  sky  and  the  earth,  so  she  gave  him  the  colour 
of  one  on  his  back  and  the  hue  of  the  other  on  his  breast, 
and  ordained  that  his  appearance  in  spring  should  denote 
that  the  strife  and  war  between  these  two  elements  was  at 
an  end.  He  is  the  peace-harbinger ;  in  him  the  celestial 
and  terrestrial  strike  hands  and  are  fast  friends."

one  of  the  three  smallest  birds  in  the  United  States.  It  is 
ranked  as  a  winter  resident,  for,  coming  from  the  north  with 
the  E/uby-crowned  species,  it  lingers  well  into  the  winter,

passing  soutliward  in  rigorous  seasons,  for  a  time  in  January 
and  February,  but  returning  very  early  in  Marcli  en  route 
to  its  northern  breeding-grounds. 

It  lias  a  decided  preference  for  evergreens  and  searches 
tirelessly  by  the  hour  for  insects  in  the  rough  bark,  but  it 
is  so  very  small  and  restless  that  it  may  easily  escape  notice. 
My  first  discovery  of  the  bird  in  the  garden  was  in  Decem- 
ber, while  looking  in  the  spruces  for  the  source  of  what  I 
supposed  to  be  the  wiry  note  of  some  belated  insect.  A 
gleam  of  sunlight  shooting  through  the  branches,  touched 
the  flaming  crown  of  the  Kinglet,  who  was  quite  close  and 
eyeing  me  inquisitively. 

The  bird  has  been  known  to  breed  in  Worcester  County, 
Mass.,  and  the  nest  is  described  by  Mr.  Brewster,  who  says 
that  in  one  nest  the  outer  walls  were  made  of  soft  green 
mosses  and  lichens ;  near  the  top  were  feathers  of  the  Euffed 
Grouse,  Hermit  Thrush,  and  Ovenbird,  ranged  quills  down 
so  that  they  made  a  tent-like  protection  for  the  eggs.  In 
the  two  nests  which  contained  eggs,  they  were  so  numerous 
as  to  be  piled  in  two  layers,  one  above  the  other. 

It  would  be  interesting  to  know  how  the  tiny  birds  man- 
age to  hatch  such  a  quantity  of  eggs :  whether  they  are  turned 
and  stirred  up  daily  in  order  to  bring  all  equally  to  the 
warmth  of  the  body,  or  if  perhaps  the  top  row  hatches  first 
and  the  young  birds,  by  their  warmth,  aid  in  bringing  out 
their  brothers  and  sisters. 

Ruby-crowned  Kinglet:  JRegulus  calendula* 

jLewgr^^;  4-4.50  inches. 

Male :  Vermilion  spot  on  crown  (which,  however,  does  not  always 
appear  until  the  second  year).  Ash-gray  head,  back  olive-gray, 
yellowish  on  tail.  Wings  brownish  oHve  with  yellow  and  white 
edgings.  Breast  and  under  parts  yellowish  gray.  Edges  of 
eyelids  white.     Bill  black,  feet  dark  brown. 

Female :  Lacking  the  red  head  spot. 

Song:  A  thin,  metallic  call  note,  like  a  vibrating  wire.  Song  full, 
varied,  and  melodious ;  often  heard  here  in  the  spring  migration. 

Season :  In  the  migrations  April-May  and  October-November. 

Breeds :  Mostly  north  of  the  United  States.

Kinglets  SONG-BIRDS. 

Nest :  Very  rare,  only  six  known.     Of  matted  hair,  feathers,  moss, 

etc.     Bulky,  globular,  and  partly  pensile. 
Eggs:  Marked  "unknown"   in  Coues's  "Key  to  North  American 

Birds,"  but  have  been  more  recently  found.   Dirty  cream- white, 

deepening  at  larger  end  to  form  a  ring.     Some  specimens  are 

spotted. 
Bange :  North  America,  south  to  Guatemala,  north  to  the  Arctic  coast. 

In  late  autumn,  even  after  a  light  November  snow,  these 
cheery,  sociable,  little  birds  come  prying  and  peering  about 
the  orchard  or  garden  fruit  trees,  examining  every  twig  or 
nook  which  may  conceal  insects  with  profound  interest. 
They  remain  at  the  most  only  a  few  weeks,  but  make  us  a 
similar  visit  in  April  on  the  return  trip.  I  only  know  its 
call  note,  though  its  full  song  is  often  heard  in  the  spring 
migration,  and  is  said  to  be  rich  and  sweet.  Mr.  Nehrling,^ 
who  has  heard  it  sing  in  central  Wisconsin  and  northern 
Illinois,  speaks  of  the  "power,  purity,  and  volume  of  the 
notes,  their  faultless  modulation  and  long  continuance." 
Dr.  Coues  says  of  it,  "  The  Kinglet's  exquisite  vocalization 
defies  description." 

It  is  a  very  valuable  bird  to  the  agriculturist,  coming 
when  most  insect-eaters  have  passed  on,  and  does  prodigious 
work  among  all  classes  of  fruit  trees,  by  killing  grubs  and 
larvae. 

The  Kinglets  have  been,  in  common  with  many  other 
attractive  birds,  recklessly  killed  for  millinery  purposes, 
but  the  present  law  in  many  States  prohibits  the  sale  of 
stuffed  song-birds  for  such  use,  and  this,  together  with  the 
increase  of  public  opinion  against  this  vandalism,  is  not  with- 
out effect ;  for  I  have  never  seen  so  many  of  these  little 
sprites  as  during  the  past  December.

SONG-BIRDS.  TitmouBO 

FAMILY  PARIDJS:   NUTHATCHES  AND  TITMICE. 

Sub- FAMILY  Paring:  Titmice. 

Tufted  Titmouse:  Parus  bicolor. 

Length :  6-6.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Crested,  with  black  spot  on  brow  at  base  of  crest. 

Above  ash-gray,  wings  and  tail  darker.    Sides  of  head  dull 

white.     Under  parts  whitish  with   brownish  wash  on  sides. 

Bill  lead- black,  feet  lead-colour. 
Song :  A  persistent  whistle,  which  Mr.  Nehrling  translates  as  "  Hee- 

dle-dee-dle-dee-dle-dee,"  and  at  other  times   "  Peto-peto-peto- 

day  tee-day  tee  !  " 
Season :  Straggling  to  southern  New  England  in  early  April  or  May 

in  company  with  many  of  the  Warblers. 
Breeds :  In  all  parts  of  range. 
Nest :  Sometimes  in  bird-boxes,  otherwise  in  the  abandoned  holes  of 

Woodpeckers,  etc.,  lined  with  hair  and  feathers. 
Uggs :  6-8,  white,  spotted  with  reddish-brown  and  lilac. 
Bange:  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  but  rare  towards  the 

northern  border,  being  a  straggler  merely  to  southern  New 

England. 

The  Tufted  Titmouse  is  quite  rare  here,  but  is  a  summer 
and,  perhaps,  winter  resident  in  southern  New  York ;  and 
whenever  it  is  seen,  it  is  sure  to  be  recognized. 

In  shape  it  has  all  the  jaunty  pertness  of  the  Blue  Jay, 
but  with  an  added  air  of  confidence  and  sociability.  Dur- 
ing the  winter  they  travel  about  in  flocks  searching  for  food, 
and  when  insects  fail  they  content  themselves  with  nuts 
and  hard  seeds  which  crack  readily,  after  the  fashion  of  the 
Nuthatches.  They  pair  in  April,  and  Mr.  Nehrling  says 
that  they  grow  silent  as  the  nesting  time  approaches,  and 
very  stealthy  in  their  movements ;  a  pair  occupied  a  Blue- 
bird house,  which  he  had  placed  on  the  edge  of  the  woods 
near  his  home  in  Texas,  and  then  shifted  to  a  Wren  box  to 
raise  the  second  brood. 

Montague  Chamberlain,  who  heard  these  Titmice  singing 
in  the  South  in  January,  thinks  that  their  song  sometimes 
takes  the  high  key  of  the  Baltimore  Oriole,  and  that  among 
other  colloquial  expressions  they  frequently  said,  "  Whip-

Chickadee  SONG-BIRDS.

most  characteristic  note. 

Chickadee;  Black-capped  Titmouse:  Parua 
atricapillus, 

Plate  10.    Fig.  2. 
Length:  6.50  inches. 
Male  and  Female:  No  crest.    Above  gray  with  a  brownish  tinge. 

Crown  and  nape,  and  chin  and  throat  black ;  sides  of  head  white. 

Below  white,  shading  to  light  gray  with  brown  wash.   Wings  and 

tail  gray  with  white  edgings.     Bill  and  feet  lead-black. 
Song :  Cheerful,  conversational.     "  Chickadee-dee-dee-dee ! ' '  varied  in 

winter  with  "Day,  day,  day  ! "  and  a  whistle  "Pfe-we,  p6-we." 
Season :  A  resident. 
Breeds :  Nearly  throughout  its  range. 
Nest:  Made  of  all  sorts  of  soft  material, — wool,  fur,  feathers,  and 

hair,  placed  in  holes  in  tree  stumps. 
Eggs :  6-8,  white,  thickly  sprinkled  with  warm  brown. 
Bange:  Eastern  North  America,  north  of  the  Potomac  and  Ohio 

Valley. 

This  hardy  little  fellow,  always  cheery  and  lovable,  is  a 
familiar  figure  in  our  light  woods  and  garden  trees  in 
autumn  and  winter,  seeming,  by  his  good-nature  and  energy, 
to  be  trying  to  console  us,  in  a  measure,  for  the  loss  of  the 
tree-haunting  summer  Warblers. 

The  Chickadee  adapts  himself  to  all  surroundings  and  to 
all  circumstances,  suiting  his  appetite  to  what  he  can  find, 
when  insects  fail,  taking  kindly  to  seeds,  berries,  cone- 
kernels,  and  crumbs. 

In  the  winter  of  1891-92,  when  the  cold  was  severe,  the 
snow  deep,  and  the  tree  trunks  often  covered  with  ice,  the 
Chickadees  repaired  in  flocks  daily  to  the  kennel  of  my  old 
dog  Colin  and  fed  from  his  dish,  hopping  over  his  back  and 
calling  "  Chickadee,  dee,  dee,"  in  his  face,  —  proceedings  that 
he  never  in  the  least  resented,  but  seemed  rather  to  enjoy. 

Taking  a  hint  from  this,  I  made  a  compound  of  finely 
minced  meat,  waste  canary  seed,  buckwheat,  and  cracked 
oats,  which  was  scattered  in  a  sheltered  spot  from  which 
the  snow  had  been  swept.     This  bird-hash  was  rapidly  con-

sumed,  and  I  was  convinced  during  that  season  that  it  was 
a  food  suited  to  the  needs  of  all  our  winter-birds,  both  seed 
and  insect  eaters  finding  in  it  what  they  required. 

The  Chickadee  breaks  the  silence  of  many  winter  days 
with  his  jovial  notes,  and  fairly  begs  for  companionship: 

Chic-chicadeedee !  saucy  note 

Out  of  sound  heart  and  merry  throat, 

As  if  it  said,  "  Good  day,  good  sir  ! 

Fine  afternoon,  old  passenger  ! 

Happy  to  meet  you  in  these  places, 

Where  January  brings  few  faces."  —  R.  W.  Emekson. 

FAMILY  PARID^:   NUTHATCHES  AND  TITMICE. 

Sub-family  Sitting:  Nuthatches. 
White-breasted  Nuthatch:  Sitta  carolinensis, 

Plate  11.    Fig.  1. 

Length:  5.50-6  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Body  flat  and  compact.  Above  slate-blue.  Top  of 
head  and  nape  black.  Wings  slate,  edged  with  brown.  Outer 
tail  feathers  brownish  with  white  bars.  Belly  white,  rusty 
toward  vent.  Bill  dark  lead-colour,  feet  dark  brown.  Female 
paler  with  colour  boundaries  less  distinctly  marked. 

Song :  A  call,  "  Quank-quank-quank  ! "  and  a  few  other  notes. 

Season :  A  common  resident,  roving  about  all  winter. 

Breeds :  Freely  in  all  parts  of  range. 

Nest :  In  tree  holes,  which  it  excavates  with  great  patience,  and  lines 
with  feathers,  moss,  etc.,  after  the  fashion  of  Titmice. 

Eggs :  Often  10,  white,  speckled  with  red  and  lilac. 

Bange :  Southern  British  Provinces  and  eastern  United  States  to  the 
Rocky  Mountains. 

This  Nuthatch,  who  is  our  most  conspicuous  bird-acrobat, 
persistently  walking  head  downward  and  performing  various 
tortuous  feats  while  he  searches  for  food,  is  a  resident  of 
the  eastern  United  States,  only  leaving  the  most  northerly 
parts  of  his  range  for  a  short  time  in  winter. 

He  appears  to  migrate  in  spring  and  return  in  autumn, 
but  in  reality  only  retreats  to  the  woodlands  to  breed, 
emerging  again  when  the  food  supply  grows  scant  in  the 
autumn. 

73 


Nuthatches  SONG-BIRDS. 

The  Nuthatches  are  great  friends  of  the  Kinglets  and 
Titmice,  and  often  travel  in  flocks  with  them.  They  pass 
for  being  shy,  but  are  not  so  in  reality,  but  merely  elusive 
because  of  their  restless  habits,  which  seldom  allow  them  to 
stay  in  one  spot  long  enough  to  be  examined.  In  fact  "  tree- 
mice,"  the  local  name  our  farmers  give  them,  is  quite 
appropriate. 

This  species  has  a  particularly  adroit  way  of  knocking  off 
bits  of  decayed  or  loose  bark  with  the  beak,  to  obtain  the 
grubs  or  larvae  hidden  beneath.  They  never  suck  the  sap 
from  trees,  as  is  sometimes  supposed,  but  are  wholly  bene- 
ficial to  vegetation. 

Bed-breasted  Nuthatch:  Sitta  canadensis^ 


Length:  4.50-4.75  inches. 

Male :  Above  lead- coloured,  brownish  on  wings  and  tail.    Crown  and 

sides  of  neck  black.     White  stripe  over  eye,  meeting  on  brow. 

Under  parts  rust-red.    Bill  dark  lead-colour,  feet  lead-brown. 
Female :  Paler,  crown  and  back  of  one  colour. 
Song :  Note  —  "  Day-day- day-dait !  " 
Season :  A  winter  resident  in  Connecticut,  but  seen  most  frequently 

in  early  spring  and  late  autumn. 
Breeds :  Chiefly  north  of  the  United  States. 
Nest :  In  holes,  like  the  White-breasted  species. 
Eggs :  Very  heavily  speckled  with  red-brown. 
Bange :  North  America  at  large,  migrating  south  in  winter. 

This  species,  like  the  preceding,  and  the  whole  family, 
in  fact,  walk  head  down  around  the  trunks  of  trees,  and 
often  roost  in  this  singular  fashion.  Their  bright  colouring 
makes  them  particularly  noticeable  among  the  leafless  trees. 
They  come  about  the  garden  every  spring,  but  more  particu- 
larly in  late  November,  when  I  have  noted  them  in  numbers 
on  Thanksgiving  Day  in  1888-89-91-92.  They  search  the 
bark  of  the  orchard  trees,  at  this  time,  with  all  the  care  of 
the  Kinglets ;  notwithstanding,  this  species  does  not  seem  to 
be  considered  by  some  authorities  a  common  bird  in  Con- 
necticut.

SONG-BIRDS.  Brown  Creeper 

Mr.  Averill,  of  Bridgeport,  says,  "  Abundant  in  September 
and  October,  1888.  Not  seen  at  any  other  time  by  me." 
Dr.  J.  A.  Allen  writes,  in  his  "  Kevised  List  of  the  Birds  of 
Massachusetts,"  "  Winter  visitant.  Not  generally  common." 
In  New  York  State  it  seems  to  be  plentiful  only  in  the 
migrations,  but  Bradford  Torrey,  in  his  essay  on  "  December 
(1888)  out  o^  Doors,"  says,  "Throughout  December,  and 
indeed  throughout  the  winter,  Brown  Creepers  and  Eed- 
bellied  Nuthatches  were  surprisingly  abundant.  Every  pine 
wood  seemed  to  have  its  colony  of  them." 

On  October  18,  of  the  past  autiunn,  half-a-dozen  pairs 
appeared  in  the  spruces  in  the  garden  and  remained  all 
winter,  and  on  January  1  I  saw  five  at  one  time  feeding  in 
the  old  apple  tree,  where  meat  had  been  placed  for  their 
benefit. 

FAMILY   CERTHIID^:    CREEPERS. 

Brown  Creeper:  Certhia  familiaris  atnericana* 

Plate  11.     Fig.  2. 
Length  :  5.50  inches. 
Male  and  Female  :  Above  brown  and  ashy-white  striped,  the  brown 

being  of  several  shades,  growing  more  red  on  rump.      Tail  pale 

brown.     Throat,  breast,  and  belly  grayish  white.      Slender, 

curving  bill,  black  above,  yellowish  below.     Feet  brown. 
Song  :  Wild  and  sweet,  but  difficult  of  syllabication.     Call  note  short 

and  lisping. 
Season  :  Winter  resident,  common  from  September  to  April. 
Breeds :  Locally  in  Massachusetts,  but  usually  further  north. 
Nest :  Tucked  into  a  crevice  between  loose  bark  and  the  trunk  of  the 

tree,  and  composed  of  moss,  sticks,  and  soft  bark. 
Eggs:  4-8,  cream-white  (sometimes  having  a  pink  tinge),  spotted  with 

brown. 
Bange :  North  America  east  of  the  Rocky  Mountains,  breeding  from 

the  northern  and  more  elevated  parts  of  the  United  States 

northward.     Migrating  southward  in  winter. 

The  Brown  Creeper  is  one  of  the  tree-trunk  birds  that, 
together  with  Woodpeckers  and  Nuthatches,  are  chiefly  to 
be  seen  when  prying  their  food  from  the  crevices  of  the 
bark.  The  Creeper  is  the  most  difi&amp;cult  to  observe  of  them 
all,  for  his  colouring  is  a  mixture  of  browns  and  grays  that 

75 


Mockingbird  SONG-BIRDS. 

blend  perfectly  with  the  background  upon  which  he  rests. 
He  has  also  a  peculiar  spiral  motion  when  creeping,  which 
renders  it  particularly  uncertain  at  what  point  he  will  re- 
appear. If,  however,  you  chance  to  see  him  with  a  glass  at 
short  range,  his  markings  will  surprise  you  by  their  rich- 
ness; and  his  sharp,  curving  bill  (very  much  like  a  sur- 
geon's needle)  completes  his  identification,  as  it  is  unlike 
the  bill  of  other  tree-trunk  birds. 

The  protective  plan  of  his  colouring  is  carried  out  in  his 
nest-building  instinct,  the  nest  being  p];actically  unfindable 
unless  the  bird  is  seen  coming  from,  or  going  to  it.  Mr. 
William  Brewster  thus  describes  the  location  of  a  nest  which 
he  found  near  Lake  Umbagog :  ^ " .  .  .  I  shortly  detected 
the  sweet,  wild  song  of  the  Brown  Creeper,  and,  looking 
more  carefully,  spied  a  pair  of  these  industrious  little 
gleaners  winding  their  way  up  the  trunk  of  a  neighbour- 
ing tree.  ...  I  instituted  a  careful  search  among  the  dead 
trees  that  stood  around,  and  at  length  detected  a  scale  of 
loose  bark,  within  which  was  crammed  a  suspicious-looking 
mass  of  twigs  and  other  rubbish.  A  vigorous  rapping  upon 
the  base  of  the  trunk  producing  no  effect,  I  climbed  to  the 
spot  and  was  about  to  tear  off  the  bark,  when  the  frightened 
Creeper  darted  out  within  a  few  inches  of  my  face,  and  the 
next  moment  I  looked  in  upon  the  eggs."  He  says  of  its 
song :  "  It  consists  of  a  bar  of  four  notes,  the  first  of  mod- 
erate pitch,  the  second  lower  and  less  emphatic,  the  third 
rising  again,  and  the  fourth  abruptly  falling,  but  dying 
away  in  an  indescribably  plaintive  cadence,  like  the  soft 
sound  of  the  wind  among  pine  boughs.  I  can  compare  it  to 
no  other  bird  voice  that  I  have  ever  heard."

MOCKINGBIRD. 

Length,  10  inches. 


SONG-BIKDS.  Mockingbird 

Song:  Natural  love-song,  a  rich,  dreamy  melody.  "Mocking"  song 
distinctly  different,  —  an  imitation  of  the  notes  of  all  the 
birds  of  field,  forest,  and  garden  broken  into  fragments. 

Season :  A  chance  visitor,  under  which  circumstances  it  is  a  summer 
resident. 

Breeds :  All  through  the  South,  and  casually  as  far  north  as  Massa- 
chusetts. 

Kest:  Loosely  made  of  leaves  and  grass,  rags,  feathers,  etc.,  bulky 
and  poorly  constructed,  never  far  from  the  ground. 

Hggs :  4-6,  bluish  green,  heavily  spattered  vsrith  shades  of  brown. 

Range :  United  States  south  into  Mexico.  Rare  from  New  Jersey,  the 
Valley  of  the  Ohio,  Colorado,  and  California  northward. 

The  Mockingbird,  commonly  known  in  this  part  of  the 
country  as  a  cage  pet  only,  does  not  properly  belong  among 
the  birds  of  the  Middle  or  Eastern  States,  but  as  there  are 
many  records  of  its  nesting  in  these  latitudes,  and  as  it  is  a 
conspicuous  and  interesting  bird,  it  is  safe  to  include  it. 

Escaped  individuals  are  often  seen  in  our  city  parks,  one 
having  lived  in  Central  Park,  New  York,  late  into  the 
winter  of  1892-93,  a  season  which  is  remembered  as  being 
very  cold  and  stormy.  Venturous  pairs  of  Mockers  have 
reared  their  young  as  far  north  as  Arlington,  near  Boston, 
and  they  are  noted  as  "  rare  summer  visitants,  occasionally 
breeding,  particularly  in  the  Connecticut  Valley,''  by  Dr. 
J.  A.  Allen.  Stratford,  Conn.,  also  has  one  breeding-record 
of  long  standing. 

The  Mockingbird  is  very  valiant  in  the  care  of  its  young, 
and  particularly  winning  and  sociable  in  its  relations  with 
man,  which  friendliness  is  illy  rewarded  by  the  theft  of  its 
nestlings,  that  they  may  be  sold  at  home  and  abroad.  In 
addition  to  this,  all  through  the  South  these  birds  are  wan- 
tonly shot  by  man  and  boy  because  they  consume  berries 
and  small  fruits. 

As  a  cage  bird  it  retains  its  nocturnal  habits,  often  sing- 
ing and  fluttering  in  the  middle  of  the  night ;  it  also  shows 
many  intelligent  traits  and  marked  preferences  for  certain 
individuals. 

The  power  of  song  varies  greatly  in  different  individuals, 
some  become  vocal  jugglers,  and  others  retain  many  of  their

thrilling,  wild  notes,  which  are  to  be  much  preferred.  The 
pathetic  quality  of  its  native  night  music  inspired  Walt 
Whitman  with  the  theme  of  one  of  his  best  poems,  —  that 
of  the  Mockingbird  searching  for  his  lost  mate,  singing  and 
calling  in  his  loneliness  :  — 

"But  soft !  sink  low ; 
Soft !  let  me  just  murmur, 

And  do  you  wait  a  moment,  you  husky-noised  sea ; 
For  somewhere,  I  believe,  I  heard  my  mate  responding  to  me. 
So  faint  —  I  must  be  still,  be  still  to  listen  ; 

But  not  altogether  still,  for  then  she  might  not  come  immediately 
to  me." 


Catbird:   Galeoscoptes  carolinensis* 

Plate  13. 

Length :  8.50-9  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  clear,  deep  slate.    Under  parts  lighter  gray. 

Crown  and  tail  black.    Vent  rust-red.    Bill  and  feet  black. 
Song :  A  brilliant  recitative,  varied  and  inimitable,  beginning,  "  Prut  1 

Prut !  coquillicot !  really,  really,  coquillicot  1    Hey  coquillicot ! 

Hey!  Victory!"    Alarm  cry,  "zeay  !  zeay  ! "  like  a  metallic 

mewing. 
Season :  Early  May  to  October  and  November. 
Breeds :  From  Gulf  States  northward  to  the  Saskatchewan. 
Nest :  In  bushes,  of  the  type  of  the  nests  of  the  Thrushes,  but  without 

clay. 
Eggs :  4-6,  clear  green-blue. 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  British  Provinces,  west 

to,  and  including,  the  Rocky  Mountains ;   occasional  on  the 

Pacific  coast.    Winters  in  the  Southern  States,  Cuba  and  Middle 

America  to  Panama.    Accidental  in  Europe. 

Next  to  the  Thrushes,  no  bird  would  be  so  much  missed 
from  the  garden  as  the  (to  my  mind  misnamed)  Catbird. 
For  it  is  as  a  garden  bird  that  it  is  best  known  here,  although 
Wilson  Flagg  considers  it  more  frequently  a  tenant  of  woods 
and  pastures.  I  have  found  it  nesting  in  all  sorts  of  places, 
from  an  alder  bush,  overhanging  a  lonely  brook,  to  a  scrub 
apple  in  an  open  field,  but  never  in  deep  woods,  and  it  is 
when  in  its  garden  home,  and  in  the  hedging  bushes  of  an  ad-

joining  field,  that  it  develops  its  best  qualities,  —  "lets  itself 
out,"  so  to  speak.  The  Catbirds  in  the  garden  are  so  tame 
that  they  will  frequently  perch  on  the  edge  of  the  hammock 
in  which  I  am  sitting,  and  when  I  move  they  only  hop  away 
a  few  feet  with  a  little  flutter.  The  male  is  undoubtedly  a 
mimic,  when  he  so  desires,  but  he  has  an  individual  and 
most  delightful  song,  filled  with  unexpected  turns  and 
buoyant  melody.  The  length  of  the  song  varies  greatly, 
sometimes  lasting  almost  uninterruptedly  for  an  hour.  One 
strain  is  used  as  an  introduction  and  as  a  constant  refrain, 
Prut!  Prut!  coquillicot!  The  ejaculation  "prut!  prut!" 
turns  into  the  shrill  "  zeay !  zeay ! "  when  he  is  really  alarmed 
or  angry. 

His  song  is  only  second,  in  its  colloquial  variety,  to  that 
of  the  Brown  Thrasher,  and  it  is  sometimes  for  a  moment 
difficult  to  distinguish  between  the  two.  He  is  particularly 
successful  in  imitating  the  whistle  of  the  Chat  (itself  a 
mimic  and  ventriloquist),  and  has  several  times  lured  me 
by  it,  through  bushes  and  briars,  only  to  mock  at  me  and 
call,  "  Hey  Victory,"  in  my  face. 

That  the  Catbird  is  a  fruit  thief,  its  best  friend  cannot 
deny ;  but  during  the  breeding-season  it  feeds  largely  upon 
insects,  and  particularly  upon  many  highly  injurious  kinds 
then  in  the  moth  stage ;  seizing  them  adroitly  in  the  air  and 
when  near  the  ground,  after  the  manner  of  Flycatchers. 

I  kept  a  Catbird  (that  had  fallen  from  the  nest)  in  a 
cage  for  many  months,  and  became  greatly  attached  to  him. 
He  was  perfectly  fearless  and  would  fly  about  the  room 
freely,  and  run  about  the  floor  with  the  rapidity  of  a  mouse. 
Frequently  he  would  perch  on  my  head,  or  flit  up  and  dexter- 
ously knock  the  ashes  off  O 's  cigar  to  attract  his  atten- 
tion.    He  had  a  great  dislike  of  newspapers,  and  if  0 

tried  to  read,  when  he  was  at  liberty,  he  would  invariably 
perch  on  the  top  of  the  sheet,  thus  bending  it  over  and 
stopping  the  proceedings,  and  then  utter  a  triumphant 
"Zeay,  Z-e-a-y!" 

It  seems  strange  that  there  should  be  any  difference  of 
opinion  about  this  merry,  friendly  bird.     Mr.  George  H.

Thrasher  SONG-BIRDS. 

Ellwanger,  near  whose  window  one  sang  early  every  morn- 
ingj  writes :  "  Nothing  could  be  more  delightful  than  his 
opening  matin  song,  begun  in  a  dulcet  undertone ;  did  I  not 
know  from  experience  his  long-drawn  crescendo  and  the 
frenzy  of  the  finale  —  a  perfect  Hungarian  ^  Czardus  ' ! 
Pelting  him  with  stones,  a  pile  of  which  I  keep  within 
reach,  stops  him,  as  it  does  my  morning  nap." 

Granting  this  even,  it  simply  proves  the  wit  of  Nature,  to 
set  this  merry,  rippling  jester,  this  whirlwind  of  delightful 
mockery,  as  a  foil,  a  companion  to  the  Thrushes  with  their 
spiritual  melodies.  Was  it  not  by  the  rendering  of  such 
contrasts  that  Shakespeare  mirrored  Nature  in  every  phase  ? 


Brown  Thrasher:  Harporhynchus  rufus, 

Plate  14. 

Length :  11  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  reddish  brown,  darker  on  wings.  Beneath 
yellowish  white,  with  brown,  arrow-shaped  spots  on  breast  and 
sides.  Wings  with  two  whitish  bands.  Tail  very  long.  Female 
paler.    Bill  black,  lower  mandible  yellow  at  base  ;  feet  light. 

So7ig :  Bravura  style,  with  frequent  colloquial  strains. 

Season :  Last  week  in  April  to  early  October. 

Breeds :  From  the  Gulf  States  northward. 

Nest :  In  low  shrubbery  or  thickly  leaved  tree,  a  boldly  made  structure 
of  grape-vine,  bark,  grasses,  twigs,  and  rootlets.  In  sandy 
localities,  generally  on  the  ground. 

Eggs:  4,  green,  sometimes  paling  to  white,  thickly  speckled  with 
brown. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States,  west  to  the  Rocky  Mountains,  north 
to  southern  Maine,  Ontario,  and  Manitoba,  south  to  the  Gulf 
States,  including  eastern  Texas.     Accidental  in  Europe. 

Song  Thrush,  Eed  Thrush,  Brown  Mockingbird,  Mavis, 
are  four  of  the  local  names  for  this  most  exultant  and  (quan- 
tity and  quality  considered)  dashing  of  our  song-birds.  He 
arrives  from  late  April  to  early  May,  and,  after  a  week 
or  so  of  almost  uninterrupted  music,  settles  down  and  pre^ 
pares  his  nest. 

It  is  impossible  to  mistake  the  Thrasher.    The  brilliant

rust-red  which  covers  his  entire  back,  his  habit  of  twitching 
and  thrashing  his  tail  when  feeding  on  the  ground,  and  his 
bold,  swinging  flight  are  certain  marks  of  identification.  His 
song  is  heard  early  in  the  morning  from  the  bushes  of  some 
pasture  or  thickly  brushed  waste,  but  later  in  the  day  he 
usually  perches  on  the  topmost  twig  of  a  tree,  and  with 
swelling  breast  and  drooping  tail  pours  forth  his  freest 
music;  and  under  no  circumstances  does  he  sing  when 
near  his  nest. 

The  song  has  the  same  colloquial  quality  as  the  Catbird's, 
without  its  extreme  rapidity,  and  one  frequently  detects  in 
it  the  pauses  peculiar  to  the  Wood  Thrush.  I  have  tried  in 
vain  to  reduce  it  to  syllables,  and  find  the  result  is  mislead- 
ing; but  the  song  is  always  bold  and  ejaculatory,  as  Thoreau 
describes  it :  "  Upon  the  topmost  spray  of  a  tree  sings  the 
Brown  Thrasher,  or  Eed  Mavis,  as  some  love  to  call  him,  — 
all  the  morning  glad  of  your  society  (or,  rather,  I  should  say, 
of  your  lands),  that  would  find  out  another  farmer's  field  if 
yours  were  not  here.  While  you  are  planting  the  seed  he 
cries,  ^  Drop  it,  drop  it,  —  cover  it  up,  cover  it  up,  —  pull  it 
up,  pull  it  up,  pull  it  up.'  " 

A  different  mood,  that  of  a  reflective  shoemaker  whom 
Wilson  riagg  knew,  wove  the  song  into  other  words,  but 
with  the  same  accented  value :  "  Look  up,  look  up !  —  Glory 
to  God,  glory  to  God!  —  Hallelujah,  Amen,  Videlicet!" 

The  Thrasher  is  something  of  a  fruit  thief,  and  I  encoun- 
tered one  this  June,  in  a  very  picturesque  attitude,  swooping 
directly  toward  me,  wings  extended,  while  from  his  beak, 
hanging  by  their  twin  stalks,  were  a  pair  of  luscious,  ripe 
cherries.  His  fruit  and  corn  eating  proclivities  are  much 
exaggerated,  however,  and  are  inconsiderable,  in  view  of 
his  usefulness  as  an  insect-destroyer.  The  Thrasher's  period 
of  song  ends  with  June,  or,  at  the  latest,  during  the  first 
week  in  July,  and  Mr.  Bicknell  says  that  it  does  not  seem 
to  have  a  second  singing  period  after  the  moulting.

Wrens  SONG-BIRDS. 

FAMILY  TROGLODYTID J]: :   WRENS,  THRASHERS,  ETC. 

Sub-family  Troglodytin^  :  Wrens. 

Carolina  Wren:  Thryothorus  ludovicianus. 

Length :  6  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Chestnut- brown  above,  wings  and  tail  barred  with 

clear  brown.     Whitish  stripe  over  eye.     White  chin.    Under 

parts  buffy.     Bill  straight  and  dark,   same  length  as  head. 

Feet  dusky  flesh-coloured.    Female  smaller. 
Song :  A  joyful  melody,  —  "  Sweetheart,  sweetheart,  sweet !  "    Also 

many  varied  mocking  notes. 
Season:  A  rather  rare  summer  visitor  north  of  New  Jersey,  yet 

breeding  sparingly  in  New  England  as  far  as  Massachusetts. 
Breeds :  Through  range,  but  seldom  in  the  northern  portion.    Raises 

two  broods. 
Nest :  Builds  a  large  nest  in  tree-holes  and  bird-boxes  as  well  as  in 

the  undergrowth  of  wild  places. 
Eggs :  6-7,  white,  spotted  with  purple  and  reddish  brown. 
Range :  Eastern  United  States  (rare  toward  the  northern  border), 

west  to  the  Plains.    Rare  in  southern  New  England. 

The  Carolina  is  the  largest  of  our  Wrens  and  is  also  the 
best  vocalist,  its  melodies  (for  it  sings  several)  having 
called  up  many  eulogies.  In  addition  to  this,  it  is  a  great 
mocker,  with  an  especial  fancy  for  weird  and  unusual 
sounds.  When  in  full  song  it  perches  on  the  top  of  a  bush 
or  small  tree,  raising  its  head  and  dropping  its  tail  in  Cat- 
bird fashion. 

It  is  a  winter  resident  in  some  of  the  Middle  States,  and 
is  said  by  Dr.  Warren  to  be  abundant  in  southwestern  Penn- 
sylvania. Though  much  more  shy  than  its  smaller  kin,  it 
builds  like  them  about  outhouses  and  in  various  odd  nooks, 
and  has  the  House  Wren's  habit  of  prying  and  peeping. 
It  collects  its  food  chiefly  from  the  bark  of  trees,  except  in 
autumn  when,  like  many  other  insect-eaters,  it  feeds  upon 
berries. 

Dr.  Shoemaker,  a  Western  bird-lover,  wrote  a  song 
beginning,  —

♦*  There  is  a  little  bird  that  sings  — 
Sweetheart  —  sweetheart  —  sweet !  " 

without  knowing  that  it  was  the  Carolina  Wren,  whose 
notes  his  accurate  ear  interpreted  in  syllables. 

House  Wren:   Troglodytes  aedon, 

Plate  15.     Fig.  1. 
Length:  4.50-5.25  inches. 
Male  and  Female  :  Dark  brown  above,  minutely  barred  with  blackish. 

Under  parts  gray  with  brownish  wash  and  faint  bandings. 

Fairly  long  tail.     Bill  black  above,  lower  mandible  light ;  feet 

brown. 
Song:  A  merry  roulade,   sudden,  abruptly    ended  and  frequently 

repeated. 
Season :  Middle  of  April  to  October. 
Breeds:  Locally  through  range.     Fiequently  rears  three  broods  a 

season. 
Nest :  A  loose  heap  of  sticks  with  a  '  oft  lining,  in  holes,  boxes,  etc. 
Eggs:  6-10,  cream-colour,  so  thick  „•  spotted  with  brown  that  the 

whole  egg  is  tinged. 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada,  west  to  Indiana 

and  Louisiana. 

The  House  Wren  is  a  bird  who  has  allowed  the  word  male 
to  be  obliterated  from  its  social  constitution  at  least.  We 
always  speak  of  Jenny  Wren ;  always  refer  to  the  Wren  as 
she,  as  we  do  of  a  ship.  It  is  Johnny  Wren  who  sings  and 
disports  himself  generally,  but  it  is  Jenny,  who,  by  dint  of 
much  fussing  and  scolding,  keeps  herself  well  to  the  front. 
She  chooses  the  building-site  and  settles  all  the  little 
domestic  details.  If  Johnny  does  not  like  her  choice,  he 
may  go  away  and  stay  away ;  she  will  remain  where  she 
has  taken  up  her  abode  and  make  a  second  matrimonial 
venture.  In  fact,  a  little  exhibition  of  independence  of  this 
kind  took  place  in  our  barnyard  last  spring. 

Jenny  makes  herself  as  much  at  home  about  the  wood- 
shed and  outhouses  as  the  mouse  does  in  the  granary,  and 
when  she  slips  in  and  out  of  the  woodpile  she  seems  like  a 
mouse  masquerading  in  feathers.     Raise  her  suspicions  or

her  anger,  however,  and  there  is  no  mouse-like  meekness 
about  her ;  she  becomes  a  tiny  shrew,  almost  thrusting  her 
bill  in  your  face  as  she  pierces  your  ears  with  her  persist- 
ent, "  Chit-chit-chit-chit ! " 

Forgive  her  for  this ;  it  is  merely  a  bad  habit,  not  really 
an  attack,  and  even  while  she  scolds,  her  mate  is  off  perch- 
ing on  the  pointed  top  of  the  clothes-post,  head  raised  high 
as  if  he  would  allow  no  unnecessary  curve  in  his  neck  to 
impede  his  outburst  of  sparkling  song.  "Foive  notes  to 
wanst,"  was  the  Irish  labourer's  comment  upon  this  song. 
"  Foive  notes  to  wanst,"  it  is,  and  I  defy  any  one  to  render 
this  appoggiatura  into  intelligible  syllables. 

The  Wrens  are  a  most  particular  bird  about  the  care  of 
their  nest,  and,  though  inhabiting  pent-up  places,  their  homes 
are  singularly  free  from  vermin.  Its  industry  is  very  great 
in  collecting  the  insects  upon  which  it  feeds,  both  itself  and 
the  young,  and  oftentimes  it  seizes  small  butterflies  when 
on  the  wing.  Usually,  as  many  as  twenty  pairs  of  these 
Wrens  build  in  the  garden  bird-boxes  and  about  the  barn 
and  sheds.  One  nest,  last  year,  was  placed  in  an  old  leather 
mitten  which  was  left  on  a  shelf  in  the  tool-house ;  the  birds 
going  in  and  out  through  the  wrist,  and,  after  stuffing  the 
thing  entirely  full  of  sticks,  to  give  stability,  they  lined  a 
little  depression  with  soft  duck  feathers. 

Winter  Wren:  Troglodytes  hiemalia. 


Length :  3.90-4.10  mches. 

Malr  and  Female :  Colour  very  similar  to  House  Wren,  but  the  under 
parts  rusty,  dimly  and  finely  barred  with  dark.  Tail  and  bill 
short,  the  latter  dark,  and  slender  ;  feet  dark. 

Song :  Strong,  and  very  musical ;  not  often  heard  here.  Call  note, 
"  tr-r-r-r-r-r." 

Season  :  Winter  resident,  arriving  often  in  October.  A  summer  resi- 
dent of  northern  New  England. 

Breeds :  Northern  New  England,  northern  portions  of  New  York  State, 
and  Pennsylvania  northward. 

Kest :  In  odd  nooks,  crevices,  logs,  etc.  Of  twigs  mixed  with  moss, 
hair,  and  feathers.

Eggs :  5-8,  pure  white,  finely  dotted  with  purple  and  brown. 
Bange :  Eastern  North  America  generally,  wintering  from  Massachu- 
setts southward. 

The  Winter  Wren  is  one  of  the  group  of  tiny  birds  that 
enliven  December,  January,  and  February.  It  is  more 
common  than  it  appears  to  be,  for  it  is  the  most  retiring 
and  shy  of  its  family.  Though  it  will  sometimes  nest  near 
dwellings,  it  prefers  seclusion,  and  especially  the  proximity 
to  running  water.  Mr.  Otto  Boehr  writes  of  the  breeding- 
habits  of  this  Wren  in  Sullivan  County,  Penn. :  "  We  found 
his  nest  but  once.  It  was  built  on  the  side  of  a  mossy  log 
that  laid  across  a  small  run  in  a  dark,  rocky  place.  The  nest 
was  composed  entirely  of  moss,  with  the  entrance  at  one 
side  near  the  bottom ;  it  contained  six  eggs,  which  resem- 
bled those  of  the  Chickadee.  The  eggs  were  fresh ;  time, 
July  4." 

Burroughs  considers  that  its  song  is  surpassed  by  very 
few,  being  of  a  gushing,  lyrical  character,  uniting  brilliancy 
and  plaintiveness. 

Short-billed  Marsh  Wren:  Cistothorus  stellaris. 

Length :  4.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  brown.  Crown  and  part  of  back  streaked 
with  black  and  white.  Wings  and  tail  barred,  White  line  over 
eye.  White  beneath,  washed  with  rusty  across  breast  and 
along  sides.  Very  short  bill,  dark  above,  light  below;  feet 
brown. 

Song :  "  'Che,  'chet,  de-de-de-de-de  ! " 

Season :  Early  May  to  late  September. 

Breeds :  In  all  but  most  southerly  parts  of  its  range. 

Nest :  Among  the  grasses  of  marshy  meadows  ;  it  is  made  of  grass  and 
always  softly  lined ;  closed  over  the  top,  with  the  entrance  at 
one  side.  It  may  be  either  suspended  between  rushes,  or  be 
placed  on  the  ground  in  a  tussock,  away  from  the  water. 

Eggs :  6-9,  pure  white. 

Mange :  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  British  Provinces,  west 
to  the  Plains.    Winters  in  the  Gulf  States  and  southward. 

The  Short-billed  Marsh  Wren  is  a  bird  of  moist  meadows 
and  reedy  places.    As  a  summer  visitor  it  is  erratic  and 

85  ' 


Wrena  SONG-BIRDS. 

irregular,  being  locally  fairly  plentiful  during  one  season, 
and  the  next  rare,  but  abundant  in  some  adjoining  place. 
It  is  very  adroit  in  eluding  the  curious,  by  disappearing  in 
the  long  grass,  and  not  emerging  until  it  is  a  long  distance 
away,  very  much  as  many  of  the  Ducks  escape  notice  by 
diving,  and  swimming  under  water. 

This  bird,  as  well  as  the  next  species,  has  a  peculiar  habit 
of  building  several  nests  every  season.  Samuels  relates  that 
these  are  built,  it  is  believed,  to  secure  protection  for  the 
female ;  so  that  when  people  search  for  the  nest  near  where 
she  is  sitting,  the  male  will  lure  the  hunter  to  an  empty 
nest.  Its  haunts,  in  this  vicinity,  are  similar  to  those  chosen 
by  the  Red-winged  Blackbird. 

liOngr-billed  Marsh  Wren:  Cistothorus  palustris, 

Plate  15.     Fig.  2. 

Length :  About  5  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  clear  brown.    Whitish  line  over  eye.    Neck 

and    back  streaked  sparingly  with  white.     Wings   and    tail 

brown,  the  latter  barred.    Below,  white,   washed  with  pale 

brown.     Bill  nearly  as  long  as  head.     Dark  above ;   lower 

mandible  light.    Feet  brown. 
Song :  Suggestive  of  the  House  Wren,  but  less  agreeable,  and  at  times 

quite  harsh. 
Season :  Summer  resident.     Early  May  to  September. 
Breeds :  Throughout  summer  range. 
Nest:  Along  river  borders.    Made  of  sedge  and  grasses  suspended 

between   tall    reeds,   above  tide  level.      Rather  bulky,   with 

entrance  on  one  side. 
JEggs :  6-10,  chocolate-brown. 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada.    In  winter  from 

the  Gulf  States  south. 

These  Wrens  have  all  the  alert  ways  and  nervous  habits 
of  the  family.  They  inhabit  marshy  and  reedy  river  wastes, 
and  often  build  their  torch-shaped  nests  in  little  colonies. 
They  are  abundant  summer  residents  all  along  the  Housar 
tonic  River,  from  Stratford  upward,  following  the  course  of 
tide  rivers  in  preference  to  smaller  streams.  It  is  not  an 
easy  nest  to  find,  even  if  you  know  where  to  look,  and  you

should  either  go  upon  your  search  at  high  tide  in  a  duck 
boat,  or  else  at  very  low  water,  wearing  seven-league  boots. 
I  could  relate  an  amusing  tale  of  an  ardent  female  wearing 
rubber  boots  on  the  bird-quest,  who,  approaching  the  reeds 
from  the  land  side,  on  seeing  one  of  the  coveted  nests  a 
little  beyond,  lost  her  head  completely,  and,  forgetting  in 
her  enthusiasm  to  pick  her  way  from  hummock  to  hummock, 
straightway  found  herself  in  two  feet  of  hidden  water,  and, 
when  she  finally  extricated  herself,  the  boots  were  left 
behind  as  a  tribute  to  the  tenacity  of  the  mud,  and  their 
own  generous  size.

Male  and  Female :  Above  dark  olive-brown.  Tail  and  wings  brown- 
black,  the  tail  shorter  than  the  wings,  several  outer  tail  feathers 
partly  or  wholly  white.  White  eye  ring  and  line  over  eye. 
Underneath  whitish  with  washes  of  various  shades  of  brown. 
Bill  dark  ;  feet  brown. 

Song :  A  hesitating  querulous  note. 

Season:  Abundant  on  salt  marshes  in  migrations,  April,  May,  Oc- 
tober, and  November. 

Breeds:  Only  in  high  latitudes,  sub- Arctic  regions,  and  in  Rocky 
Mountains,  etc. 

Nest :  Close  to  ground,  of  grass,  moss,  or  lichens. 

Eggs :  4-6,  chocolate-colour,  marked  and  scratched  with  black. 

Bange :  North  America  at  large,  wintering  in  the  Gulf  States,  Mexico, 
and  Central  America.    Accidental  in  Europe. 

The  Titlark  may  be  recognized  by  its  very  uncertain, 
wavering  flight,  seldom  remaining  long  in  one  spot,  but 
moving  on  and  hovering  and  wheeling  about  the  place 
where  it  intends  next  to  alight.  I  have  seen  them  fre- 
quently in  the  fields,  on  late  October  mornings  when  every- 
thing was  white  with  hoar  frost  and  they  were  gleaning  a 
breakfast,  uttering  their  thin  notes  and  scattering  irregu- 
larly, only  to  gather  immediately  on  some  convenient  fence-

rail,  or  telegraph  wire.  They  also  flock  in  the  autumn- 
ploughed  fields,  searching  out  the  newly  uncovered  grubs 
and  larvae.  When  on  the  ground  they  resemble  the  Water 
Thrushes  and  they  are  continually  jerking  their  tails  about, 
a  habit  which  has  given  them,  together  with  these  Thrushes, 
the  title  of  Wagtails. 

FAMILY  MNIOTILTID^:  WOOD  WARBLERS.    ' 
Black  and  White  Warbler:  Mniotilta  varia, 

Plate  16.     Fig.  1. 

Length :  About  5  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  striped  black  and  white.     White  stripe  on 

top  of  head,  bordered  by  black  stripe.     White  stripe  over  eye. 

Black  cheeks  and  throat,  separated  by  a  black  line.    Breast 

white  in  middle,  black  stripe  on  sides.     Wings  and  tail  black  ; 

wings  with  two  white  cross-bars  and  some  white  edgings,  tail 

with  white  markings  on  outer  quills.     Bill  and  feet  black. 

Female  paler  stripings,  less  distinct.     Strong  resemblance  to 

the  Downy  Woodpecker. 
Song :  Feeble  and  lisping,  "  Weachy,  weachy,  weachy,  'twee  — 'twee, 

'twee  'tweet." 
Season  :  April  to  late  September. 

Breeds :  From  Virginia  and  southern  Kansas  northward. 
Nest :  Low  down,  either  oh  a  stump  or  the  ground,  composed  of  bark, 

grass,  leaves,  hair.      Very  difficult  to  find. 
Eggs :  4-5,  white,  dotted  thickly  with  red  and  brown. 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  north  to  Fort  Simpson, 

south,  in  winter,  to  Central  America  and  the  West  Indies. 

The  Black  and  White  Warbler  is  one  of  the  most  familiar 
and  sociable  of  the  Warblers.  At  first  you  will  doubtless 
think  it  a  small  Woodpecker,  as  it  is  seen  principally  scram- 
bling around  tree  trunks  searching  for  the  insect  food  upon 
which  it,  together  with  the  entire  family  of  Warblers,  sub- 
sists. 

During  the  past  four  years  this  Warbler  has  not  varied  a 
week  in  the  dates  of  his  first  and  last  appearance  in  the 
garden.  He  has  come  to  a  certain  gnarled  old  apple  tree, 
his  favourite  resort,  twice  on  May  2,  once  May  1,  and 
once  April  29,  and  has  invariably  been  last  seen,  in  the 
same  locality,  between  September  25  and  October  2.

SONG-BIRDS.  TVarblers 

The  Creeper,  when  at  rest,  is  not  at  all  graceful,  but  it  is 
most  interesting  to  watch  its  zig-zag  course  from  the  tree 
trunk  out  to  the  angles  of  the  crooked  branches,  picking  up 
insects  which  are  invisible  to  us,  with  its  slender,  sharp  bill. 
In  watching  the  manoeuvres  of  all  bark-feeding  birds,  you 
must  keep  in  mind  that  the  eyes  of  birds  are  powerful  mag- 
nifiers, and  that  to  them  objects  appear  twenty-five  times  as 
large  as  they  do  to  us. 

Worm-eating  Warbler:  Hehnitherus  vermivorus. 


Length:  6.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Head  yellowish  brown,  black  stripe  on  each  side 

of  crown,  also  back  of  eye.     Above  greenish  olive.    Under  parts 

buffy.    Bill  and  feet  light. 
Song:   Similar  to  that  of    Chipping   Sparrow,  —  "trrrr-rrr-rrr,"  — 

from  which  Mr.  llidgway  says  that  "it  is  difficult  sometimes 

for  the  most  critical  listener  to  distinguish  it.' ' 
Season  :  Rare  summer  resident  in  southern  New  England. 
Breeds :  In  all  parts  of  its  United  States  range,  but  casually  in  the 

northerly  sections. 
Nest :  On  the  ground  in  woods,  and  in  swamp  tussocks,  or  in  a  ground 

hollow  like  the  Ovenbirds,  and  composed  chiefly  of  leaves. 
Fggs :  4-5,  clear  white,  specked  with  reddish  brown. 
Bange:  Eastern  United  States,  north  to  southern  New  York  and 

southern  New  England,  west  to  eastern  Nebraska  and  Texas, 

south,  in  winter,  to  Cuba  and  Central  America. 

This  compact,  soberly  clad  Warbler  is  not  at  all  common 
north  of  New  Jersey,  and,  even  where  it  is  plentiful,  it  is 
very  likely  to  escape  notice ;  for  its  colouring  is  such  as  to 
make  it  blend  with  the  ground  upon  which  it  nests,  or  with 
the  branches  and  trunks  of  trees  where  it  frequently  creeps 
and  circles  in  feeding,  after  the  manner  of  the  Brown 
Creeper.  Its  nest  seems  also  to  be  well  concealed,  and 
generally  in  remote  places,  for  the  descriptions  of  it  are 
infrequent. 


Warblera  SONG-BIRDS. 

Blue-winged  Warbler:  Helminthophila  pinus. 

Length :  4.75  inches. 

Male  :  Above  olive-green.  Wings  a  slatish  blue  with  white  bars  ;  tail 
plain  slate.  Forehead  and  under  parts  clear  yellow,  dark  stripe 
through  eye.    Bill  bluish  black. 

Female :  Paler  throughout,  with  a  general  olive  cast. 

Song :  Sharp  and  metallic,  drawling  and  continuous. 

Season :  May  to  September.     A  common  summer  resident. 

Breeds :  Throughout  range. 

Nest :  On  or  near  the  ground  ;  sometimes  in  the  centre  of  a  plant  tuft. 
Made  of  grass,  etc.,  and  rather  deep  and  bulky. 

Eggs :  4-5,  white,  with  reddish  dots. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States,  from  southern  New  York  and  south- 
em  New  England  southward ;  in  winter  Mexico  and  Guate- 
mala. 

The  name  of  this  bird  is  misleading  to  the  novice,  as  the 
blue  of  the  wing  is  dull  and  inconspicuous,  and  not  blue  at 
all  in  the  sense  in  which  this  colour  distinction  is  applied 
to  the  Bluebird  and  Jay.  It  is  well  to  remember  the  fact 
that  only  two  or  three  of  our  New  England  birds  are  "  true 
blue,"  and  that  the  term,  when  applied  to  the  Warblers 
especially,  simply  means  either  a  bluish  gray,  or  slate,  which 
seems  barely  different  from  plain  gray  at  a  short  distance. 

These  Warblers  are  not  a  bird  of  gardens  and  open  places, 
preferring  well-brushed  woods,  but  come  frequently  into  the 
orchard  in  the  blossoming  time,  and  search  the  trees  care- 
fully for  insects,  as  they  feed  almost  wholly  upon  spiders, 
larvae,  and  beetles,  such  as  are  found  in  bark,  bud,  or  flower. 
They  are  very  beautiful  birds,  with  brilliant  plumage,  and 
dainty  little  tricks  and  manners,  and  are  usually  seen  con- 
sorting in  pairs. 

Golden- winged  Warbler :  Helminthophila  chrysoptera. 

Length :  About  5  inches. 

Male:  Yellow  crown  and  wing  bars.  Above  bluish  gray.  Chin, 
throat,  and  eye  stripe  black.  Throat  divided  from  sides  of 
head  by  white  line.  Below  ashy  white,  tinged  with  yellowish. 
Bill  and  feet  blackish.

SONG-BIRDS.  Warblers 

Female  :  Olive  above.     Below  dusky,  eye  stripe  gray. 

So7ig  :  An  insect-like  sound,  "zee-zee-zee  !  " 

Season :  May  and  September. 

Breeds :  North  from  northern  New  Jersey  and  northern  Indiana,  and 

southward  along  the  Alleghanies  to  South  Carolina. 
Eggs  and  Nest :  Same  as  last  species. 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States,    north  to  southern  New  England, 

southwestern  Ohio,  and  southern  Minnesota. 

The  Golden-winged  Warbler  seems  to  be  considered  rare, 
or  only  locally  common,  in  many  parts  of  its  range.  It 
comes  about  the  orchard  sparingly  in  May,  but  has  a  habit 
of  retiring  very  suddenly  into  dense  underbrush,  which  ren- 
ders its  identification  difficult.  Its  name  also  is  very  delu- 
sive ;  for,  if  you  go  out  to  search  for  a  gorgeous  bird  with 
canary-yellow  wings,  you  will  never  suspect  this  bird,  with 
small  golden  splashes  on  the  iving  coverts  only,  of  being  the 
Golden-winged  Warbler. 

All  Warblers  depend  upon  their  markings  rather  than 
song  for  their  identity,  which  renders  the  majority  of  the 
tribe  of  greater  interest  to  the  scientist  than  to  the  novice. 

In  fact,  until  you  have  named  four  or  five  of  the  com- 
monest  species  as  landmarks,  you  will  be  considerably  con- 
fused, and  feel  oftentimes  inclined  to  scold  the  brilliant 
beauties,  and  tell  them  that  they  are  bores,  like  gaily  dressed 
people  who  have  no  conversational  ability;  and  also  that 
fine  feathers  do  not  make  fine  voices,  but  quite  the  reverse. 
Then  some  gloomy  recess  in  the  pines  will  be  lighted  by 
the  flitting  birds,  like  sun  motes  filtering  through  the 
branches,  and  all  is  forgiven,  and  you  will  say,  "  I  knoiv,  at 
least,  that  these  are  Warblers/^  which,  after  all,  is  some- 
thing. 

Nashville  Warbler:  Helminthophila  ruficapilla. 

Length :  About  5  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  No  bars  on  wings  or  tail.  Clear  yellow  heloio. 
which  remains  constant  all  the  season.  Above  olive-green, 
brightening  on  the  rump  and  shoulders.  Slate-gray  head  and 
neck,  obscure  chestnut  spot  on  poll ;  wings  and  tail  brownish. 
Bill  and  feet  dark.  Female  dull  olive.

Warblers  SONG-BIRDS. 

Song:  Feeble  — "  Que-ar-Que-ar-Que-ar,"   a  note  wliich  Audubon 

says  sounds  like  the  breaking  of  twigs. 
Season :  Summer  resident,  perhaps,  from  late  April  to  September  and 

October,  but  only  plentiful  as  a  migrant. 
Breeds :  From  New  England  northward. 
Nest:  On  the  ground,  sometimes  in  mossy  banks.     Nest  made  of 

fibres,  pine-needles,  etc. ,  with  a  lining  of  the  softer  grasses  and 

hair. 
Eggs :  4,  blush  white  (if  fresh),  thickly  speckled. 
Bange:  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains,  north  to  the  Fur 

Countries.    Mexico  in  winter. 

This  brilliant  Warbler  is  a  common  summer  resident  from 
Massacbusetts  northward,  but  I  think  irregularly  so  in  this 
part  of  Connecticut.  It  visits  us  freely,  however,  in  May 
or  sometimes  the  last  week  in  April,  and  usually  appears  in 
greater  numbers  on  its  return  trip  in  the  fall.  They  are  shy 
birds,  prying  about  the  borders  of  woodlands,  and  here,  in 
the  fall  migration,  they  haunt  a  belt  of  wild  hemlocks  that 
border  the  rocky  banks  of  a  stream ;  Dr.  Warren  says  that 
in  the  southward  migration  in  Pennsylvania,  they  are  seen 
in  small  parties  feeding  among  the  willows  along  the  banks 
of  streams  and  ponds. 

The  name  "  Nashville "  was  applied  to  this  Warbler  by 
Wilson,  who  discovered  it  near  Nashville,  Tenn.,  but  it  is 
another  case  of  a  poor  name  for  a  beautiful  bird,  and,  like  so 
many  other  titles,  unsatisfactory  in  the  extreme.  The  ac- 
cepted English  name  of  a  bird  should  embody  some  of  its 
personal  attributes,  as  the  Latin  title  frequently  does  ; 
ruficapilla,  from  rufuSy  red,  and  capilla,  hair,  signifies  that 
the  bird  has  red  markings  on  his  head.  Why  is  Nashville 
given  as  an  English  equivalent  ?  The  American  Ornitholo- 
gists' Union  has  a  magnificent  chance  to  show  its  inventive 
ability  in  such  cases,  and  then,  perhaps,  the  Wood  Warblers, 
as  a  family,  may  be  better  known  by  the  masses.

SONG-BIRDS.  "Warblera 

Parula  Warbler :  Compsothlypis  americana. 

Blue  TelloW'hacTced  Warbler. 


Length :  4.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Above  slate-blue,  triangular  spot  of  greenish 
yellow  back  of  shoulders.  Chin  and  throat  yellow.  Wings 
brownish  with  two  white  bars  ;  two  white  spots  on  tail.  Belly 
white,  reddish  brown  band  across  breast.  Markings  of  under- 
parts  variable.  Bill  black  above  and  flesh-coloured  below. 
Feet  light.  In  spring  the  female  closely  resembles  the  male, 
but  lacks  the  brown  wash  on  breast. 

Song :  Shrill  wiry  —  "  Chirr- rirr-irr-reeh."     (Nehrling.) 

Season  :  April  to  October. 

Breeds :  Eastern  United  States  and  northward. 

Nest :  In  swamps  where  the  usnea  moss  is  plentiful,  or,  at  least,  never 
far  from  water.  Nest  a  delicate  structure  of  filmy  moss,  sus- 
pended from  a  slender  branch. 

Uggs :  4-5,  with  reddish  spots. 

Mange :  Eastern  United  States,  west  to  the  Plains,  north  to  Canada, 
and  south  in  winter  to  the  West  Indies  and  Central  America. 

In  early  May,  before  the  apple  trees  are  in  bloom,  if  you 
look  up  among  their  branches  you  will  see  this  airy  little 
bird  flitting  in  and  out,  pausing  every  moment,  head  down 
in  Titmouse  fashion,  then  raising  its  head  again  to  utter  its 
chirping  song,  and,  lifting  its  wings,  seems  half  to  fly,  half 
to  be  blown  from  branch  to  branch. 

This  is  the  bird  that  awakened  Burroughs,  when  a  boy, 
to  the  unfamiliar  birds  that  lodge  in  very  familiar  woods. 
He  writes,  under  title  of  "The  Invitation,"  in  "Wake 
Kobin  " :  "  Years  ago,  when  quite  a  youth,  I  was  rambling  in 
the  woods  one  Sunday  with  my  brothers,  gathering  black 
birch,  wintergreens,  etc.,  when,  as  we  reclined  upon  the 
ground,  gazing  vaguely  up  into  the  trees,  I  caught  sight  of  a 
bird  that  paused  a  moment  on  a  branch  above  me,  the  like 
of  which  I  had  never  before  seen  or  heard  of .  .  .  .  How  the 
thought  of  it  clung  to  me  afterward !  It  was  a  revelation. 
It  was  the  first  intimation  I  had  had  that  the  woods  we 
knew  so  well,  held  birds  that  we  knew  not  at  all."

So  it  is  with  each  one  of  us.  Some  day  a  bird  absolutely- 
new  and  unknown  flies  through  the  orchard  or  sings  above 
the  familiar  footpath  through  the  woods,  which,  though  it 
is  meant  to  be  a  "  short  cut "  to  somewhere,  is  often  rendered 
a  loitering-ground  by  the  magic  of  these  very  bird  voices 
that  speak  so  directly  to  us. 

A  special  gift  of  sight  is  needed  to  search  out  these  tree- 
flitting  Warblers,  but  in  this  case  the  nest  of  the  Parula  will 
tell  you  of  its  whereabouts  if  you  are  so  lucky  as  to  find  it. 
No  other  bird  of  our  fauna  builds  a  structure  akin  to  its 
swinging,  eery,  moss  nest,  and  the  day  you  find  it  must  be 
noted  with  red  ink  in  your  journal.  (See  Building  of  the 
Nest,  p.  20.) 

Yellow  Warbler:  Dendroica  mstiva. 

Summer  Yelloivbird. 

Plate  10.     Fig.  1. 

Length:  4.75-5  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Above  rich  olive-yellow,  brightening  on  the  rump; 
breast  and  under  parts  golden-yellow.  Breast  streaked  with 
cinnamon-brown.  Wings  and  tail  olive-brown  edged  with  yel- 
low. Bill  lead-coloured ;  feet  light  brown.  Female  darker  with 
streaks  on  breast  faintly  marked  or  absent. 

Song:  Rapid  warble,  "Sweet -sweet -sweet -sweet -sweet -sweeter- 
sweeter?"     Seven  times  repeated. 

Season  :  First  week  in  May  to  middle  September. 

Breeds :  In  all  parts  of  its  North  American  range. 

Nest :  In  the  crotch  of  some  terminal  branch  of  a  fruit  tree,  or  stout 
shrub,  made  of  the  frayings  of  milkweed  stalks  lined  with 
fern  wool  and  hair. 

Eggs :  4-5,  greenish  or  grayish  white,  spotted  and  blotched  with  lilac 
tints  and  red-browns. 

jRange :  North  America  at  large,  except  southwestern  part,  south  in 
winter  to  Central  America  and  northern  South  America. 

In  early  May,  often  on  May-day  itself,  if  the  weather  is 
clement,  when  the  marsh-marigolds  are  vanishing  from  the 
swamps,  and  the  cherry  trees  are  in  bloom,  the  Yellow 
Warblers  descend  upon  the  gardens  and  orchards. 

They  come  like  whirling  leaves,  half  autumn  yellow,  half

SONG-BIRDS.  Warblers 

green  of  spring,  the  colours  blending  as  in  the  outer  petals 
of  grass-grown  daffodils.  Lovable,  cheerful  little  spirits, 
darting  about  the  trees,  exclaiming  at  each  morsel  that  they 
glean.  Carrying  sun  glints  on  their  backs  wherever  they 
go,  they  should  make  the  gloomiest  misanthrope  feel  the 
season's  charm.  They  are  so  sociable  and  confiding,  feeling 
as  much  at  home  in  the  trees  by  the  house  as  in  seclusion. 

This  bird  is  one  of  the  particular  victims  which  the  Cow- 
bird  (see  page  167)  selects  to  foster  its  random  eggs,  but 
the  Warbler  puts  its  intelligence  effectively  to  work,  and 
builds  a  floor  over  the  unwelcome  egg,  and  repeating  the 
expedient,  if  the  Cowbird  continues  her  mischief,  until 
sometimes  a  three-story  nest  is  achieved.  In  spite  of  the 
Warbler's  seeming  preference  for  man's  society,  it  builds 
also  in  lonely  fields  and  byways.  The  most  beautiful  nest 
that  I  have  found,  and  which  is  now  before  me,  was  set  in 
the  crotch  of  an  old  elder  bush,  about  six  feet  from  the 
ground,  by  the  side  of  the  marsh  lane.  The  outside  is  com- 
posed of  glistening  milkweed  flax,  which  forms  a  felt-like 
case,  and  likewise  lashes  the  nest  to  its  support.  The  inte- 
rior, to  the  depth  of  an  inch,  is  made  of  the  wool  from  the 
stems  of  young  ferns,  matted  into  a  material  resembling 
soft  sponge ;  and  inside  this,  to  give  shape  and  stability,  are 
woven  a  few  horsehairs.  The  Yellow  Warbler  sings  from 
its  arrival  until  July,  but  has  no  second  song  period. 

Black- throated  Blue  Warbler:  Dendroica  ccerulescens. 


Length :  About  5  inches. 

Male:  Above  bluish  slaty,  rather  than  blue;  lighter  on  forehead. 
Black  throat,  extending  along  sides  of  body.  White  spot  on 
wings  ;  outer  tail  feathers,  white  spotted.  Beneath  white. 
Bill  and  feet  dark. 

Female :  Entirely  different.  Greenish  olive  above,  light  yellow  under- 
neath, wing  spots  smaller. 

Song:  A  plaintive  strain,  not  particularly  noticeable.  Call  note, 
♦'Z-ip,  z-ip." 

Season :  Early  May  to  September  in  northern  New  England.    Here  as 
a  migrant  in  May  and  October.

"Warblers  SONG-BIRDS. 

Breeds :  From  northern  New  England  and  New  York  northward. 

Nest :  Close  to  the  ground  in  bushes. 

Eggs :  Typical  Warbler's  eggs. 

Range :  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains.     West  Indies  in  winter. 

Again  we  find  the  term  blue  used  in  reference  to  a  War- 
bler whidi  is  of  an  inconspicuous,  dull  slate  colour.  This 
Warbler  is  likely  to  be  one  of  the  most  difficult  of  its  tribe 
to  identify,  as  its  plumage,  being  wholly  devoid  of  yellow, 
is  not  easily  seen  among  the  trees. 

All  authorities  agree  that  its  favourite  nesting-haunts  are 
near  swampy  ground  and  in  laurel  thickets,  especially  in 
those  parts  of  Connecticut  where  it  breeds.  Mr.  Averill 
notes  the  bird  as  a  "  tolerably  common  migrant,"  but  I  can 
find  no  breeding-record  for  it  in  this  vicinity.  Still,  I  think 
that  they  sometimes  breed  here,  for  I  saw  a  pair  on  May  30, 
in  the  laurel  glen  near  Aspetuck,  who  were  evidently  col- 
lecting building-materials;  for  the  male  bird  had  the  dry 
tendrils  of  a  small  vine  in  his  beak. 

Myrtle  Warbler:   Dendroica  coronata, 

Tellow-rumped  Warbler. 

Plate  16.     Fig.  2. 

Length:  5.50  inches. 

Male :  Slate  colour,  striped  and  streaked  with  black.  Crown,  sides  of 
breast,  and  rump  yelloto.  Below  whitish  ;  upper  breast  black. 
Two  white  cross-bars  on  wings  ;  tail  with  white  spots.  In  loin- 
ter,  brownish  olive ;  yellow  of  rump  constant,  but  lacking  on 
crown  and  breast.    Bill  and  feet  black. 

Female :  Resembling  the  winter  male. 

Song :  A  few  notes  only  —  "  Twhip-tweeter-tw^eter. " 

Season :  Most  plentiful  Warbler  in  the  migrations,  and  also  a  winter

America.

SONG-BIRDS.  Warblers 

In  the  spring  and  fall  migrations,  and  particularly  in  the 
spring,  this  is  one  of  the  most  conspicuous  of  the  smaller 
migrant -birds.  In  autumn  it  grows  more  sociable,  and  in 
winter  it  comes  freely  about  the  barn  and  sheds  in  search  of 
food,  often  in  the  company  of  Juncos,  Tree  Sparrows,  and 
Titmice,  individuals  of  this  species,  wintering  as  far  north 
as  Massachusetts ;  a  few,  according  to  Dr.  Allen,  remaining 
at  Cape  Cod. 

In  winter  it  forsakes  its  usual  insect  diet  for  such  ber- 
ries as  it  can  find.  Dr.  Warren  says  that  in  Pennsylvania 
the  berries  of  the  poison-sumach  {Rhus  venenata)  are  a 
favourite  article  of  its  food,  during  the  early  winter,  and 
these  Warblers  congregate  in  considerable  numbers  where 
the  bush  is  abundant. 

Speaking  of  the  baleful  poison-sumach,  with  its  scatter- 
ing clusters  of  whitish  berries,  it  is  well  for  the  amateur 
ornithologist  to  be  on  the  watch  for  it,  as  its  poison  is  so 
insidious  that  it  affects  many  people  through  substantial 
clothing.  It  may  be  easily  distinguished  by  the  fact  that 
the  flower  clusters  come  from  the  leaf  axils,  and  the  berries 
are  whitish  and  semi-translucent,  while  the  harmless  species 
of  suma&lt;?h  bear  their  flowers  in  terminal  spires,  which  turn 
to  sticky,  opaque  berries  of  a  rich,  brilliant  red.  Hamilton 
Gibson's  clever  jingle  will  prove  a  talisman,  against  either 
poison-sumach,  or  the  commoner  poison-ivy  {Rhus  toxlcoderir 
dron)  to  those  who  will  memorize  it :  — 

"  Berries  red, 
Have  no  dread  I 
Berries  white, 
Poisonous  sight  I 
Leaves  three 
Quickly  flee!" 

Magnolia  Warbler:  Dendroica  maculosa, 

Black-and-  Yellow  Warbler. 


Length :  4.76-5  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above,  back  dark  olive,  crown  a  bluish  ash,  bor-

dered  by  white  lines,  and  these  framed  in  black,  extending 
across  forehead  and  sides  of  head.  Wings  dark,  bars  white, 
and  small  spots  of  white  on  tail.  Bump  and  under  parts  rich 
yellow,  the  latter  streaked  with  black  across  the  breast  and 
along  the  sides.     Bill  and  feet  dark. 

Song :  Not  particularly  distinguishable. 

Season  :  Migrant,  common  the  middle  of  May. 

Breeds :  Breeding  from  northern  New  England,  New  York,  and  Michi- 
gan, to  Hudson's  Bay  Territory. 

Nest  and  eggs :  Warbler  type. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America  to  the  base  of  the  Rocky  Mountains ; 
in  winter,  Bahamas,  Cuba,  and  Central  America. 

The  Magnolia  Warbler  is  one  of  the  most  gaily  dressed 
of  all  his  dainty  family,  and  is  quite  easily  identified  by  his 
distinct  markings.  It  is  only  a  migrant  here,  lodging  with 
us  a  while  in  May,  and  passing  through  in  autumn.  But  be 
sure  to  look  for  it  in  May,  for  in  October  it  wears  the  duller 
travelling  cloak  with  which  Nature  protects  so  many  of  her 
feathered  children  in  their  journey  through  the  leafless 
trees. 


Chestnut-sided  Warbler :  Dendroica  pensylvanica. 


Length :  About  5  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Top  of  head  yellow.  Black  stripe  running  through 
the  eye,  and  a  black  spot  in  front  of  it.  Back  and  wing  cov- 
erts streaked  black  and  yellow.  Throat  and  breast  white,  with 
chestnut  stripe  starting  at  the  black  mustache  and  extending 
down  the  sides.  Belly  black ;  feet  brown.  Female  less  highly 
coloured. 

Song:  '"Che-'che-'ch-'cheea." 

Season:  First  week  in  May  to  September.  Also  very  plentiful  in 
migrations. 

Breeds :  From  central  Illinois,  and  probably  northern  Georgia  north- 
ward. 

Nest :  In  bushes  and  low  trees  ;  when  in  the  latter  a  forking  branch 
is  chosen.  Nest  on  general  plan  of  the  Yellow  Warbler's,  but 
coarser  and  less  woolly. 

Eggs :  Some  simply  speckled ;  others  prettily  chained  with  chestnut. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada ;  west  to  the 
Plains.     Visits  the  Bahamas  and  Central  America  in  winter. 


SONG-BIRDS.  "Warblera 

A  most  abundant  and  sociable  bird  in  the  spring  migra- 
tion, the  Chestnut^sided  Warbler  becomes  shy  and  retiring 
in  the  breeding-season,  and  in  the  fall  journey  keeps  well 
in  the  protection  of  the  trees. 

During  the  second  week  of  May,  1892,  after  a  storm 
which  had  lasted  three  days,  a  perfect  swarm  of  Warblers 
appeared  in  the  garden,  among  the  evergreens  and  on  the 
walks,  and,  after  arranging  their  wind-beaten  plumage,  dis- 
persed to  satisfy  appetites  that  seemed  to  have  been  tried 
by  a  long  fast.  Upon  going  to  the  door  about  seven  o'clock 
in  the  morning,  I  was  greatly  surprised  to  see  a  dozen  or 
more  of  the  Chestnut-sided  Warblers,  chiefly  males,  feeding 
eagerly  upon  some  minute  insects  that  they  picked  from 
the  gravel,  while  among  them  were  several  Eedstarts,  mov- 
ing backward  and  forward  with  the  airy  motion  which  is 
peculiarly  theirs,  and  which  seems  as  if  they  were  propelled 
by  a  puff  of  wind  rather  than  their  own  volition.  The  War- 
blers were  so  fearless,  owing  to  their  hunger,  that  they  only 
moved  a  few  yards  away  when  I  went  out  to  see  what  they 
were  eating.  Upon  scanning  the  gravel  on  the  path,  I  found 
that  it  was  literally  plastered  together  by  myriads  of  dead 
ants,  which  had  been  drowned  out  of  their  hills  at  the  roots 
of  some  large  trees,  and  washed  down.  The  same  condition 
obtained  in  other  parts  of  the  garden,  and  these  ants,  together 
with  the  abundant  earth-worms  and  various  seeds  in  the  lawn 
and  many  low-flying  insects,  brought  together  such  a  carni- 
val of  migrants  as  I  had  never  before  seen  outside  of  the 
cases  of  a  museum,  —  Thrushes,  Warblers,  Flycatchers,  and 
Finches  of  all  descriptions,  that  seemed  to  have  been  swept 
into  the  garden  shelter  by  the  fury  of  the  storm. 


Bay-breasted  Warbler:  Dendroica  castanea» 

Length:  5.25-5.75  inches. 

Male :   Above  streaked  with  black  and  grayish  olive.     Forehead, 

cheeks,  and  sides  of  head  black,  enclosing  a  chestnut  patch. 

Chin,  throat,  upper  breast,  and  a  streak  along  the  sides  dull 

chestnut.    Below  buffy.     White  cross-bars  on  wings  and  white

Warblers  SONG-BIRDS. 

spots  on  tail.  Bill  and  feet  dark.  Female  with  crown  olive- 
green  and  chestnut  striped  with  black. 

Song :  Not  marked,  insect  like. 

Season :  A  rare  migrant  here.  Seen  in  May,  and  less  frequently  on 
the  return  trip. 

Breeds :  From  northern  New  England  and  northern  Michigan  north- 
ward. 

Nest :  Large  and  rough,  for  so  small  a  bird,  made  of  tree  moss  and 
twigs,  and  fur-lined. 

JSggs :  Blue-green  and  spotted. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America,  north  to  Hudson's  Bay  ;  winters  in 
Central  America. 

This  Warbler  is  an  irregular  migrant  in  the  greater  part 
of  its  range ;  sometimes  it  will  not  be  seen  at  all  in  a  locality 
where  in  previous  seasons  it  was  fairly  constant.  The  chest- 
nut colouring  of  the  breast  is  the  distinctive  mark  by  which 
it  may  be  recognized,  and  this  dull  red  breast  renders  it 
conspicuous  and  more  likely  to  be  discovered  than  many 
plainer,  though  more  common  species.  In  full  spring  plu- 
mage the  male  looks,  at  a  little  distance,  like  a  well-fed  Robin 
in  miniature. 

The  Bay-breasts  seem,  according  to  many  authorities,  to 
be  very  freaky  and  capricious  as  to  the  course  of  their 
migrations,  and  it  is  said  they  return  to  the  South  by  a  dif- 
ferent route  from  that  by  which  they  travelled  up  in  spring, 
no  two  people  being  able  to  agree  with  certainty  as  to  the 
locations  where  they  may  be  found.  Dr.  Allen,  in  his  "  List 
of  Massachusetts  Birds,''  says  that  they  are  common  in 
both  migrations,  varying  in  abundance;  while  Mr.  Minot 
says  that  as  a  rule  these  birds  are  rare  in  spring  in  eastern 
Massachusetts  and  are  never  seen  in  autumn,  —  the  con- 
sensus of  opinion  being  that  in  some  seasons  the  birds  take 
a  westerly  course  in  spring  and  an  easterly  in  autumn,  or 
vice  versa.  All  of  which  goes  to  prove  that  you  may  have 
considered  this  Warbler  an  unknown  bird  in  your  locality, 
and  some  May  morning  in  looking  out  your  window  you  will 
find  a  little  party  of  them  almost  peering  in  at  you.

SONG-BIRDS.  Warblers 


Black-poll  Warbler:  JDendroica  striata. 

Length :  About  5.50  inches, 

Male :  Black  cap,  grayish  white  cheeks,  general  upper  parts  striped 

gray,   black,   and  olive.     Breast  white,  with    black   streaks. 

White  spots  on  outer  tail  feathers  ;  upper  mandible  brownish 

black,  lower  yellowish;  feet  flesh-coloured. 
Female :  Crown  and  back,  olive-green,  faintly  streaked  with  black. 

Paler  than  male  all  through. 
Song:  Call  note,  "Screep,-screep."     Torrey  says  that,  short  as  the 

song  is,  it  contains  a  perfect  crescendo  and  a  perfect  decres- 

cendo. 
Season :  Late  May  and  late  October.     One  of  the  latest  arrivals  among 

the  migrants. 
Breeds :  From  northern  New  England  northward. 
Nest:   In  evergreens.     Nest  large  for  the  size  of  the  bird,  as  Mr. 

Brewster  notes  several  nests  5  inches  across  and  8  inches  deep. 

They  are  made  of  terminal  shoots  of  conifers,  lichens,  rootlets, 

and  sedges,  lined  with  grass  panicles. 
Eggs :  Not  especially  marked. 
Mange:  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Rocky  Mountains,  north  to 

Greenland,  the  barren  grounds,  and  Alaska.     South  in  winter 

to  northern  South  America. 

The  jolly  Black-poll  has  all  the  vivacity  and  activity  of  a 
Flycatcher,  and,  in  fact.  Dr.  Coues  gives  it  credit  for  many 
of  the  Flycatcher's  attributes,  and  says  that  it  catches 
insects  on  the  wing  with  the  same  ease  as  the  Wood  Pewee. 

Some  authorities  say  that  the  Black-poll  climbs  and  walks 
about  the  trees  in  the  manner"  of  the  Black  and  White 
Warbler.  I  do  not  think  that  it  does  this ;  for  I  watched  a 
number  of  them  at  short  range  last  spring,  and  while  the 
birds  seeyned  to  creep,  they  really  Jlew  about  by  means  of  a 
short  and  rapid  flip  of  the  wings. 

Their  call  notes,  which  were  the  only  ones  I  heard,  were 
very  weak  and  scarcely  distinguishable  from  other  wood 
sounds,  and  I  have  often  mistaken  them  for  the  creaking  of 
a  branch.  Audubon  says :  "...  its  notes  have  no  title  to 
be  called  a  song.  They  are  shrill,  and  resemble  the  noise 
made  by  striking  two  small  pebbles  together  more  than  any 
other  sound  I  know."

Blackburnian  Warbler:  Dendroica  blackburnite. 

Torch  Bird. 

Length:  5.50  inches. 

Male :  Black  head,  striped  with  flame,  black  wings  and  tail  with  white 
markings,  black  streak  on  throat.  Throat  and  breast  flame- 
colour.     Lower  parts  yellowish.     Bill  and  feet  dark. 

Female :  Olive-brown  above,  entire  breast  yellow. 

Song :  A  thin  warble,  with  little  variety,  ending  with  a  high  Z — . 

Season :  A  migrant  here ;  seen  occasionally  through  May,  but  is  less 
uncommon  in  September. 

Breeds:  From  the  northern  and  more  elevated  parts  of  the  eastern 
United  States  northward.  Dr.  Merriam  says  that  a  few  breed 
in  Connecticut,  and  Dr.  Allen  notes  them  as  casual  residents  in 
Massachusetts. 

Nest :  Well  concealed  by  bark  and  moss ;  built  in  small  trees  and 
bushes,  preferably  evergreens. 

Eggs :  4-6,  white,  with  lilac  and  chestnut  shell  markings,  chiefly  on 
the  larger  end. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains ;  in  winter  south  to  the 
Bahamas,  Central  America,  and  northern  South  America. 

Another  Warbler,  with,  a  totally  inadequate  name.  It 
should  be  called  the  Torch  Bird,  for  half  a  dozen  of  them,  as 
they  flash  about  in  the  pines,  raising  their  wings  and  jerk- 
ing their  tails,  make  the  darkest  shadows  seem  breaking 
into  little  tongues  of  flame.  Look  for  them  in  the  autumn, 
and  you  will  find  that  even  then  their  colours  will  vie  with 
the  most  brilliant  leaf  tints.  But  because  some  one  named 
Blackburn  first  discovered  or  reported  the  Warbler,  it  bears 
the  name  Blackburnian.  Burroughs  says :  "  The  hum  seems 
appropriate  enough,"  .  .  .  but  "...  the  Orange-crowned 
Warbler  would  seem  to  be  his  right  name,  his  characteristic 
cognomen." 

Black-throated  Green  Warbler :  Dendroica  virens. 

Length :  5  inches. 

Male:  Back  and  crown  bright  olive-yellow^  sides  and  front  of 
head  clear  yellow.  Entire  throat  and  upper  breast  black, 
black  continued  in  a  stripe  down  the  sides.  Lower  parts

yellowish  white.     Wings  and  tail  brownish,  white  wing  bars. 

Bill  and  feet  dark. 
Female:  Chin  yellowish,  throat  dusky,  below  pale  whitish.     In  au- 
tumn plumage  the  male  resembles  the  female. 
Song :  Cheerful  interrogative,  "  Will  you  co-ome,  will  you  co-ome, 

will  you?" 
Season :  A  summer  resident,  also  abundant  in  the  migrations.    Comes 

in  April,  retires  to  woods  to  breed  in  May,  emerges  in  September. 
Breeds:  From  New  England,  New  York,  and  the  higher  parts  of 

Pennsylvania  northward. 
Nest :  At  the  forking  of  high  branches  ;  made  of  twigs,  bark,  grasses, 

and  lined  with  hair,  roots,  down,  etc. 
Eggs :  4-5,  white,  sprinkled  and  veiled  with  brown-purple. 
Bange :  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains,  north  to  Hudson's  Bay 

Territory  ;  in  winter,  south  to  Cuba  and  Panama.     Accidental 

in  Greenland  and  Europe. 

You  will  have  but  little  trouble  in  recognizing  this  bril- 
liant and  talkative  little  Warbler,  which  comes  to  us  both 
as  a  summer  resident  and  as  a  migrant.  In  late  April  I  am 
always  sure  to  see  its  green  and  gold  feathers  among  the 
hemlocks  on  the  east  side  of  the  garden,  while  it  continually 
utters  its  anxious  and  persuasive  notes,  to  which  I  eagerly 
respond.  It  repeats  a  little  phrase  that  separates  it  from 
the  indistinct  songs  of  so  many  of  its  tribe :  "  Will  you 
co-ome,  will  you  co-ome,  will  you  ?  "  it  says,  giving  a  par- 
ticularly emphatic  pause  on  the  last  two  syllables. 

It  has  never  nested  in  the  garden,  and  only  comes  to  it 
before  the  breeding  and  after  the  moulting  season. 

Pine  Warbler:  Dendroica  vigorsii. 

Length:  5.50-6  inches. 

Male :  Above  bright  yellowish  olive,  clear  yellow  below,  dark  streaks 

on  sides.     Yellow  eye  line  ;   white  bars  on  wings.      White 

blotches  on  two  outer  tail  feathers. 
Female :  Dull  throughout,  dirty  white  instead  of  yellow  breast. 
Song:  A  delicately  trilled  whistle.     (Minot.) 
Season:  A  locally  common  summer  resident,  May  to  October  and 

November.    Possibly  a  resident.     Some  remain  in  the  Middle 

States  all  winter. 
Breeds :  All  through  its  range,  beginning  in  the  Carolinas  in  March. 
Nest  and  Eggs :  No  special  marks  of  identification.

Warblers  SONG-BIRDS. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  north  to  Ontario  and 
New  Brunswick,  wintering  in  the  South  Atlantic  and  Gulf 
States,  and  the  Bahamas. 

The  Pine  Warbler,  the  largest  of  the  tribe,  shares  with 
the  Myrtle  and  Palm  Warblers  the  distinction  of  being  one 
of  the  three  hardiest  of  the  tribe.  Like  so  many  of  the 
family,  they  are  most  frequently  seen  in  hemlock  and  pine 
woods,  and  also  in  parks  and  gardens  where  these  conifers 
have  been  planted  freely.  This  Warbler  has  none  of  the 
delicacy  of  shape  or  beauty  of  colouring  belonging  to  his 
kin.  Even  the  male  in  full  plumage  shows  few  dainty 
variations  and  blendings  of  colour,  and  it  has  a  heaviness  of 
build  that  is  more  Finch-like. 

The  best  way  to  designate  its  song  is  to  say  that  it  has 
some  of  the  qualities  of  a  Sparrow's ;  remembering  to  keep 
in  mind  (as  with  all  Warblers)  that  the  notes  are  never  clear 
and  pure  as  in  the  case  of  Sparrows  and  Thrushes,  but  are 
half  whispered,  as  if  to  save  the  strain  on  the  vocal  chords. 
This  Warbler  combines  some  of  the  traits  of  a  Creeper  and 
Flycatcher.  It  often  circles  about  the  tree  trunks  like  the 
Nuthatch  or  Brown  Creeper,  sails  into  the  air  after  insects, 
and  then  descends  to  the  ground,  all  in  the  space  of  a  few 
minutes. 

Yellow  Palm  Warbler:  Dendroica   palmarum  hypo- 
chrysea. 

Length :  6  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Chestnut  crown,  brownish,  verging  on  olive  above, 

with  some  dark  streaks ;  rump  and  wing  coverts  yellowish. 

Under  parts  clear  yellow,  with  bright  chestnut  streaks  on  the 

sides.     Wings  and  tail  dull,  dark  brown.    Bill  and  feet  dark. 

Female  not  essentially  different. 
Song :  Unknown  to  me.     It  gives  a  few  whispering  notes  as  it  feeds. 
Season :  A  migrant,  middle  of  April  and  October. 
Breeds :  Northward  from  Nova  Scotia  and  New  Brunswick. 
Nest :   On  the  ground,  and  very  deep  ;  made  of  weeds,  grasses,  and 

lined  with  moss,  fine  grasses,  and  hair. 
Eggs:  2-4,  rosy  white,  marked  with  brown  spots  at  the  large  end. 
Bange :  Atlantic  States  north  to  Hudson's  Bay  ;  winters  in  the  South 

Atlantic  and  Gulf  States.

SONG-BIRDS.  "Warblers 

This  Warbler  —  only  distinguishable  by  slightly  supe- 
rior size  and  a  more  evenly  yellow  breast  from  the  Yellow 
Eedpoll  of  the  Interior  and  Western  States  —  is  a  lover  of 
cool,  brisk  weather,  and  is  almost  the  first  of  its  tribe  to 
pass  upward  to  its  northern  breeding-grounds.  It  spends  a 
few  early  April  days  in  the  leafless  roadside  bushes,  often 
appearing  when  the  first  hepaticas  are  in  bloom,  and  leav- 
ing before  the  shadbush  blossoms,  and,  though  it  feeds  on 
the  ground,  it  has  the  habit  of  making  little  sallies  into  the 
air  like  the  Redstart  and  the  Flycatchers. 

It  does  not  return  in  autumn  until  warm  weather  is  a 
thing  of  the  past,  and  is  not  at  all  abashed  if  a  hard  frost, 
or  even  a  flurry  of  snow,  overtakes  it,  seeming  to  partake  of 
the  nature  of  the  Yellow-rumped  Warbler,  who  is  the  winter 
companion  of  Chickadees  and  Kinglets. 

Prairie  Warbler:  Dendroica  discolor o 

Length:  4.75-5  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Colours  much  broken  up.  Upper  parts  olive-greeq 
or  yellow,  chestnut-red  streaks  across  back  between  the  wings. 
Under  parts  beautiful  yellow  ;  also  yellow  streak  running  from 
nostril  back  of  eye,  and  two  yellow  wing  bands.  Sides  of  neck 
and  body  streaked  with  black ;  also  black  line  through  eye. 
Inner  webs  of  outer  tail  feathers  white.  Female  paler,  and 
chestnut  bars  obscured. 

Song :  "  Wee-wee-chee-chee-chee-chee  1 " 

Season :  Common  May  migrant ;  also  probably  breeds  here. 

Breeds :  Through  its  United  States  range. 

Nest :  In  small  trees  or  low  brush,  scrub  pines,  etc.  Cedar  and  grape- 
vine bark,  feathers  and  fern  down,  elaborate  and  beautiful. 

^ggs :  4,  greenish  white,  wreathed  on  larger  end  with  various  browns. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  north  to  Michigan  and 
southern  New  England ;  winters  in  southern  Florida  and  the 
West  Indies. 

The  diminutive  Prairie  Warbler,  which  may  be  known  by 
the  reddish  streaks  across  its  back,  has  a  decidedly  southerly 
range.  It  is  quite  abundant  all  through  the  Middle  and 
Southern  States,  and  fairly  common  along  the  Massachu-

Dr.  Coues  says  that  it  is  remarkable  for  its  quaint  and 
curious  song.  I  have  never  heard  its  best  musical  efforts, 
for  its  notes  seem  to  me  harsh,  like  the  familiar  call  of  the

Ovenbird;  Golden-crowned  Thrush:  Seiurus 
aurocapillus, 

Plate  17.     Fig.  1.

stripes  on  head,  enclosing  an  orange  crown.  White  below,  with 
brownish  spots  in  the  centre  of  breast  running  into  streaks 
on  the  sides.    Brown  bill,  legs  and  feet  flesh-coloured. 

Song:  Call  note,  " Teacher-teacher-teacher  1 "  given  in  gradual 
crescendo.  The  love-song  liquid  like  that  of  the  Water  Thrush, 
but  seldom  heard. 

Season :  May  to  October. 

Breeds :  Northward  from  Kansas,  the  Ohio  Valley,  and  Virginia. 

Nest :  A  ball  of  leaves  and  grasses  on  the  ground  with  a  side  opening, 
hence  the  name  Ovenbird,  though  the  nest  bears  a  closer  resem- 
blance to  the  earth  huts  the  Italian  labourers  build. 

Eggs:  4,  cream- white,  specked  with  brown-purple. 

Bange:  Eastern  North  America,  north  to  Hudson's  Bay  Territory 
and  Alaska ;  in  winter  southern  Florida,  the  West  Indies, 
and  Central  America. 

With  the  Ground  Warblers  we  come  again  to  birds  with 
musical  voices,  who,  even  if  they  do  wear  more  sober  plu- 
mage, are  a  welcome  change  from  the  lisping  prettiness  of 
the  previous  groups. 

If  you  wish  to  identify  the  Ovenbird,  or  Golden-crowned 
Thrush,  as  he  is  still  called,  you  must  trust  to  sound  rather 
than  sight,  for  you  will  hear  far  oftener  than  see  him.  On 
his  arrival  in  the  early  part  of  May,  he  comes  familiarly 
about  the  garden,  sometimes  in  company  with  the  Veery, 
and  spends  a  week,  perhaps,  among  the  shrubs  and  ever- 
greens, running  out  on  the  ground  occasionally,  with  an 
alert  air,  as  if  looking  for  his  mate.

At  this  time  the  bird  appears  like  a  small,  slender 
Thrush,  with  a  little  golden-brown  streak  on  the  crown. 
Suddenly  from  the  pines  comes  the  half-defiant  call, 
"  Teacher,  Teacher,  TEACHER ! "  each  syllable  accented, 
and  rattled  off  with  increasing  volume,  and  you  are  quite 
incredulous  that  so  small  a  bird  can  utter  such  a  sound. 
The  notes  are  familiar  to  you ;  you  have  heard  them  a  hun- 
dred times  breaking  the  intense  noon  stillness  of  the  woods, 
but  you  had  supposed  that  they  proceeded  at  least  from  a 
large  Woodpecker;  but  no,  it  is  the  Ovenbird;  and  this 
call  has  given  him  a  third  name,  —  the  Accentor.  By  the 
tenth  of  May  they  leave  the  garden  and  seek  the  lighter 
woods  where,  having  paired,  they  go  into  deeper  shade  to 
build  their  homes. 

Hickory,  oak,  and  beech  woods,  with  fern-grown  banks 
sloping  to  a  stream,  are  their  favourite  haunts,  and  on  these 
banks,  where  the  ground  is  covered  with  leaves  in  various 
stages  of  decay,  they  build  their  hut-like  nests.  While 
thus  occupied,  the  males  give,  at  rare  intervals,  an  exquisite 
little  serenade  to  their  mates,  which  is  wholly  different 
from  the  shrill  call  notes.  It  is  most  likely  to  be  heard 
when  the  bird  is  on  the  wing  in  the  early  evening,  and 
somewhat  resembles  the  music  of  the  Louisiana  Water- 
thrush.  Many  people  who  are  familiar  with  its  nest 
and  haunts  have  never  heard  this  love-song.  The  nest 
is  extremely  difficult  to  locate;  settled  as  it  is  into  a 
ground  hollow  and  roofed  over,  it  may  be  easily  passed 
by  as  a  bunch  of  huddled  leaves.  Sometimes  you  may 
see  a  bird  alight  on  the  ground  and  run  nimbly  toward 
such  a  tuft,  and  that  will  be  the  best  method  of  finding  the 
nest,  which,  though  it  is  cleverly  hidden,  often  holds  the 
unwelcome  eggs  of  the  Cowbird.  All  the  singing  and  call- 
ing is  done  from  the  trees;  and,  as  you  look  up  in  the 
uncertain  wood-light,  the  singers  appear  to  be  only  dusky 
specks,  like  the  few  last  year's  leaves  that  still  lodge  there. 
But  when  the  rare  music  is  heard,  the  little  brown  mote  is 
transfigured,  and  soars  above  the  trees.

Water  Thrush:  Seiurus  noveboracensis, 

Woter-wagtail. 

Length :  5-6  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above,  including  wings  and  tail,  plain  olive-brown. 

Under  parts  sulphur-yellow,  specked  everywhere,  except  a  space 

in  the  middle  of  belly,  with  dark  brown.     Spots  small  on  throat, 

and  growing  larger  below.     Bill  and  feet  dark. 
Song :  Liquid  and  Thrush-like. 
Season  :  Early  May,  late  August,  and  September. 
Breeds  :  From  northern  New  England  northward. 
Nest :  In  inaccessible  swampy  places,  especially  sphagnum  bogs,  upon 

the  ground,  or  between  old  stumps  ;  bulky  ;  made  of  moss,  roots, 

and  grass. 
Eggs .'  4-6,  white  and  thickly  speckled. 
Eange  :  Eastern  United  States  to  Illinois,  and  northward  to  Arctic 

America  ;  south  in  winter  to  the  West  Indies  and  northern 

South  America. 

The  Water  Tlirusli  usually  appears  at  the  same  time  as  the 
Ovenbird,  but  never  ventures  with  it  into  the  garden.  He  is 
a  water-loving-  recluse,  who  seems  to  have  learned  his  song 
from  the  brooks  that  tinkle  and  dance  over  the  little  pebbles, 
and  is  never  content  away  from  the  voice  of  his  teachers. 

If  you  catch  a  glimpse  of  him,  away  he  goes,  running 
through  the  leaves  and  tangled  underbrush,  wagging  or 
jerking  his  tail  in  a  very  knowing  way,  and  few  land-birds 
will  lead  you  such  an  uncertain  dance  through  bog  and 
briars  as  he  will,  if  you  have  the  pluck  to  follow  him. 

Louisiana  Water  Thrush:  Seiurus  Tuotacilla, 

Length  .•  6-6.25  inches. 

Male  and  Female .  Peculiarly  heavy,  dark  bill.  Above  grayish  brown, 
with  a  brown  crown  and  white  line  over  the  eye.  Creamy  white 
breast,  sparingly  streaked  with  brown.    Legs  lightish. 

Song  .•  A  thrilling  warble,  interspersed  with  flute  and  water  notes. 

Season :  Summer  resident,  arriving  the  last  of  April.

SONG-BIRDS.  Warblers 

This  Thrush,  which,  until  comparatively  lately,  has  been 
considered  out  of  its  range  in  New  England,  is  a  fairly  com- 
mon summer  resident  all  through  this  section  and  as  far 
north  in  the  state  as  Say  brook.  It  differs  chiefly  from  the 
Water  Thrush  in  its  superior  size  and  heavier  bill  and  the 
buff  colouring  of  its  lower  parts ;  but  its  principal  point  of 
identification  at  long  range  is  the  greater  richness  and  mel- 
ody of  its  song. 

The  past  summer,  in  late  June,  a  male  of  this  species 
spent  an  entire  morning  in  a  secluded  part  of  the  garden, 
in  some  bushes  near  the  pool.  It  was  after  the  breeding- 
season  (unless  this  individual  was  either  belated  or  about  to 
raise  a  second  brood),  but  the  song  retained  all  of  its  spring 
volubility.  The  song  first  attracted  me,  and,  after  crawling 
cautiously  through  the  tall  grass,  I  discovered  the  singer. 

He  was  perching  near  by,  in  the  lower  branches  of  a 
scrubby  arbor-vitse.  He  did  not  sing  continuously,  but, 
after  waiting  a  few  minutes,  took  up  his  refrain.  Droop- 
ing his  wings,  he  threw  back  his  head,  his  smooth  throat 
swelling  with  pent-up  music. 

In  a  few  minutes,  he  went  down  to  the  pool,  took  a  few 
sips  of  water,  and  amused  himself  by  running  over  the  thick 
water-lily  leaves,  at  the  same  time  snatching  insects  from 
their  edges.  He  next  took  a  vigorous  bath,  sprinkling  the 
water  about  with  great  force,  and  then  retired  into  a  clethra 
bush  to  plume  himself.  This  completed,  he  sang  once  more, 
and  he  seemed  to  have  a  joyous  yet  serious  message  to  im- 
part, rather  than  a  flood  of  gossip. 

In  the  swamp  in  secluded  recesses 

A  shy  and  hidden  bird  is  warbling  a  song. 


Sing  on  !  sing  on,  you  gray-brown  bird  I 
Sing  from  the  swamps,  the  recesses,  pour 

Your  chant  from  the  bushes. 
0  liquid  and  free  and  tender  I 
0  wild  and  loose  to  my  soul  1 
O  wondrous  singer !

Warblers  SONG-BIRDS. 

Mourning"  Warbler :   Geothlypis  Philadelphia, 

Length :  5.25-5.50  inches. 

Male :  Decidedly  marked  gray  head  and  7ieck,  the  feathers  having 
black  edges  that  give  them  a  crape-like  quality;  the  rest  of 
upper  parts  yellowish  olive.  Throat  and  upper  breast  usually 
black,  veiled  with  some  ash-gray  feathers.  Bich  yellow  lower 
breast  and  belly.  Wings  and  tail  glossy  olive-green.  Upper 
mandible  dark,  lower  mandible  and  feet  flesh-coloured. 

Song  :  "  Let  me  see,  let  me  see,  let  me  see,  do  !  " 

Season  :  A  rare  migrant,  —  May  and  September. 

Breeds:  In  the  Berkshires,  and  from  the  mountainous  portions  of 
Pennsylvania,  New  England,  New  York,  and  Michigan  north- 
ward. 

Nest  and  Eggs :  Like  those  of  the  Maryland  Yellow-throat. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains  ;  Central  America  and 
northern  South  America  in  winter. 

The  Mourning  Warbler  is  seen  here  only  as  a  migrant,  but 
its  appearance  is  so  marked  that  it  deserves  mention  even 
when  others  of  the  same  genus  of  equal  rarity,  but  of  less 
distinctive  plumage,  are  omitted.  Dr.  Coues  refers  to  it 
as  resembling  in  its  appearance  and  behaviour  a  gay  and 
agreeable  widow,  who  is  conscious  that  her  weeds  are  becom- 
ing. Its  general  habits,  like  its  song,  somewhat  resemble 
those  of  the  Maryland  Yellow-throat,  but  though  a  Ground 
Warbler,  nesting  and  spending  much  time  in  the  bushes  and 
tangles,  it  does  its  most  vigorous  singing  in  the  tree-tops  of 
woods  where  the  underbrush  has  been  left  imdisturbed. 

Burroughs  says:  "The  Ground  Warblers  all  have  one 
notable  feature,  —  very  beautiful  legs,  as  white  and  delicate 
as  if  they  had  always  worn  silk  stockings  and  satin  slippers. 
High  Tree  Warblers  have  dark  brown  or  black  legs  and 
more  brilliant  plumage,  but  less  musical  ability." 

Maryland  Yellow-throat:   Geothlypis  trichas,

head  masked  with  black,  separated  by  ash-white    line    from 

crown.     Black  bill ;  flesh-coloured  feet. 
Female :  Smaller,  and  colours  less  distinct ;   mask  wanting,  as  it  is 

also  in  the  young. 
Song :  "Follow  me,  follow  me,  follow  me  !  " 
Season :  From  May  to  September.    Common  summer  resident. 
Breeds :  From  Georgia  northward. 
Nest :  Large  and  deep,  sometimes  partly  roofed  over ;  made  of  broad 

grasses,  either  on  ground  or  in  bushy  tangles. 
Eggs :  4-6,  white,  sparsely  sprinkled  with  brown. 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States,  mainly  east  of  the  Alleghanies,  north 

to  Ontario  and  Nova  Scotia;    in  winter,  South  Atlantic  and 

Gulf  States  and  the  West  Indies. 

Next  to  the  Yellow-Wood  Warbler,  this  Ground  Warbler 
is  the  best  known  and  merriest  of  the  entire  clan,  and  easily 
identified  by  his  mask,  yellow  throat,  and  distinctive  song. 

Early  in  May  you  will  see  a  flash  of  yellow  among  the 
white  flowers  of  the  dogwood  (Cornus  Jlorida),  or  quivering 
in  the  willows,  and  a  bright  eye  peers  through  the  black 
mask  and  a  sweet,  persuasive  voice  calls,  "  Follow  me,  fol- 
low me,  follow !  '^  If  you  wisely  accept  the  invitation,  you 
will  become  so  well  acquainted  with  all  of  his  little  innocent 
airs  and  graces  that  before  the  summer  has  passed  you  will 
recognize  his  plainer,  maskless  mate,  and  perhaps  note  the 
plumage  development  of  the  young. 

In  following  this  Merry  Andrew  across  some  old  pasture 
or  along  a  thickly  shrubbed  fence,  you  will  also  discover  his 
nest.  The  nest  that  I  have  now  before  me  was  found  not 
far  below  the  garden  wall,  in  an  old  meadow,  where  a  tangle 
follows  the  watercourse,  and  was  lodged  between  tall  weeds 
and  grasses  at  a  little  distance  from  the  ground.  It  is  of  a 
long  cup-shape,  the  form  of  the  little  baskets  in  which  straw- 
berries used  to  be  sold,  and  which  were  called  pottles.  It  is 
quite  bulky,  made  of  wide  grass-blades  and  leaves,  and  very 
thick  at  the  bottom,  the  nest  being  shallow  in  the  interior 
and  lined  with  vanilla  grass.  This  nest  is  not  roofed  over, 
but  shows  a  tendency  to  it  by  being  higher  and  slightly 
curved  on  one  side,  as  if  the  bird  had  intended  to  form  a 
roof  and  then  changed  its  mind.

Yellow-breasted  Chat:  Icteria  virens, 

Plate  19.     Fig.  1. 

Length:  7.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Olive-green  above  ;  brilliant  yellow  throat,  breast^ 
and  wing  linings.  Whitish  belly,  white  line  over  eye,  and  white 
spot  beneath.  Brownish  glaze  on  wings  and  tail.  Strong,  curv- 
ing, blue-black  beak.    Feet  lead-coloured. 

Song :  A  varied  whistle,  with  a  decided  ventriloquistic  quality,  inter- 
spersed with  mocking  syllables. 

Season :  Common  summer  resident.    May  to  September. 

Breeds :  All  through  its  summer  range. 

Ifest :  Bulky,  made  of  leaves,  bark,  and  dead  twigs,  lined  with  grasses  ; 
placed  in  briary  and  inaccessible  bushes. 

Eggs  :  3-4,  often  of  unequal  size,  white,  mottled  with  buff  and  spotted 
with  red  and  lilac. 

Jtange:  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  north  to  Ontario  and 
southern  New  England,  south,  in  winter,  to  eastern  Mexico 
and  Guatemala. 

A  bird  easily  recognized  by  its  large  size  and  brilliant 
colour.  The  Chat  has  reversed  the  motto  so  often  preached 
at  children,  and  is  heard  more  than  seen.  When  seen,  how- 
ever, it  is  the  picture  of  healthy,  well-groomed  beauty,  with 
a  voice  at  once  powerful  and  melodious,  and  a  reputation 
for  shyness  of  disposition,  which  trait  takes  the  form  of 
a  bewitching  elusiveness  that  it  seems  to  know  is  very 
attractive. 

Its  call  notes,  and  the  mocking  gibes  which  it  utters  from 
the  bushes  to  the  distraction  of  the  bewildered  passer-by, 
are  wholly  different  from  the  fervent  spring  song.  Then 
it  yields  to  an  ecstasy  of  feeling,  and  soars  singing  into  the 
air,  trailing  its  long  legs  behind  like  a  Heron,  and  look- 
ing, it  must  be  confessed,  very  foolish;  but  after  a  few 
weeks  it  abandons  its  aerial  gymnastics  and  contents  itself 
with  taunting,  teasing,  and  misleading  both  man,  beast,  and 
bird. 

On  general  principles  the  Chat  is  a  mischief-maker,  who 
starts  petty  deceits  and  fosters  them,  is  quick  to  grasp  a 
situation,  knowing  at  once  the  most  provoking  thing  to  say, 
and  is,  in  fact,  a  wood-imp.     Near  the  garden  wall  there  is

a  tangle  of  cedars,  before  which  are  the  kennels  where  the 
dogs  are  chained  at  night.  Early  one  morning  they  set  up 
a  chorus  of  grieved  and  disappointed  howls,  and,  on  going 
to  find  the  cause,  I  found  them  tugging  at  their  chains  and 
casting  longing  glances  toward  the  cedars.  I  listened  a 
moment,  and  there  came  a  succession  of  whistles,  like  their 
master's  call,  and  I  found  that  a  Chat  was  working  off  his 
spirits  in  this  way.  A  few  days  later,  in  going  up  the  lane 
road  with  a  very  slow  horse,  I  heard  the  same  whistle  from 
the  bushes,  and  it  was  not  imagination  alone  that  gave  these 
syllables  to  the  chattering :  "  Whew !  whew !  whew !  Hi ! 
get  a  whip.  Chuc-archuck,  chuck.  Whew  !  Hi !  "  Then 
the  Chat  flashed  into  the  open,  just  to  show  that  it  was 
really  he  himself,  and  was  gone. 

Hooded  Warbler:  Sylvania  mitrata. 

Length:  5-5.25  inches. 

Male :  Black  hood,  chin,  and  upper  breast.  Yellow  face,  lower  breast, 
and  under  parts.  Above  rich  olive  ;  white  spots  on  outer  tail 
feathers.    Bill  black,  feet  light. 

Female :  Similar,  but  with  the  cowl  restricted  or  lacking. 

Song :  "  Che-we-eo-tsip,  tsip,  che-we-eo  !  " 

Season :  May  to  September.  A  rare  summer  resident  here,  according 
to  Mr.  Averill. 

Breeds :  Through  its  United  States  range. 

Nest :  In  bushes  in  damp  woods,  of  bark  strips,  skeleton  leaves,  cat- 
kins, and  grasses,  woven  with  spider  webs. 

Eggs :  4,  white,  with  reddish  brown  speckles. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States,  west  to  the  Plains,  north  and  east  to 
Michigan,  southern  New  York,  and  southern  New  England; 
in  winter,  West  Indies,  eastern  Mexico,  and  Central  America. 

In  general  appearance  like  the  Yellow-throat,  save  that 
the  black  on  the  head  forms  a  complete  hood  (except  for  the 
yellow  face)  meeting  under  the  chin  like  a  cape.  This 
jaunty  little  bird  looks  as  if  he  had  assumed  his  black  cowl 
for  masquerading  purposes  only,  and  might  be  expected  to 
throw  it  off  at  any  moment.  Quite  plentiful  in  some  parts 
of  this  state  J  it  has  been  known  to  nest  near  Bridgeport,

and  also  in  the  vicinity  of  Saybrook.  It  has  a  particular 
fondness  for  our  Connecticut  swamps,  where  the  pink  azaleas 
and  laurels  crown  the  intersecting  banks,  and  it  usually 
nests  at  the  time  when  the  azalea  fades,  and  the  laurel 
comes  into  bloom. 

Wilson's  Warbler :  Sylvania  pusilla. 

Black-capped  Warbler. 

Length :  4.75  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Black  cap.  Above  olive-yellow,  olive-yellow  edg- 
ings to  wings  and  tail.  Under  parts  rich  yellow,  shades  to  olive 
on  sides.  Line  over  eye  and  foreliead  deep  yellow.  Bill  dark 
above  lower  mandible  and  feet  light.  Female  without  the 
black  cap. 

Song :  An  indistinct  warble. 

Season :  An  uncommon  migrant,  seen  here  in  May. 

Breeds :  Chiefly  north  of  the  United  States. 

Nest :  On  the  ground. 

Eggs:  4-5,  white,  heavily  spotted  and  sprinkled  with  mauve  and 
lilac. 

Bange:  Eastern  North  America,  west  to  and  including  the  Rocky 
Moimtains,  north  to  Hudson's  Bay  Territory  and  Alaska, 
migrating  south  to  Eastern  Mexico  and  Central  America. 

This  striking  bird  ranges  quite  freely  through  the  state 
as  a  migrant,  but  little  is  known  of  its  New  England  breed- 
ing possibilities.  Mr.  H.  D.  Minot  found  its  nest  on  Pike's 
Peak  at  an  altitude  of  11,000  feet,  almost  at  the  timber  line. 

Canadian  Warbler:  Sylvania  canadensis* 

Length:  5.25-5.50  inches. 

Male :  Above  ash-blue,  crown  spotted  with  arrow-shaped,  black  marks 
blending  on  the  brow.  Below  pure  yellow,  with  a  showy  neck- 
lace of  black  longitudinal  bars  across  the  breast.  Yellow  line 
over  eye,  black  patch  under  it.    Bill  dark,  feet  flesh-coloured. 

Female :  Paler  all  through,  and  the  black  obscured. 

Song:  "A  fine  sibilant  chirp,  reminding  one  of  a  canary's  song,  but 
broken  and  incomplete."     (Nehrling.) 

Season :  Common  migrant  in  the  latter  half  of  May. 

Breeds :  Casually  in  New  England,  and  north  to  the  tree  limit. 

Nest :  Of  dry  grass  and  leaves  on  the  ground.

back.  He  has  charming  manners,  and  a  dainty  way  of  giv- 
ing a  little  old-fashioned  bob  courtesy  whenever  he  sees  a 
passer-by.  His  song  is  quite  pretty,  but  not  by  any  means 
a  certain  mark  of  identification ;  in  fact,  I  do  not  think  that 
there  are  more  than  eight  or  ten  of  the  whole  Warbler  tribe 
whose  notes  will  serve  as  a  guide  to  any  one  but  an  ornithol- 
ogist well  up  in  field  practice. 

American  Redstart:    Setophaga  ruticilla» 

Plate  20. 

Length :  5-5.50  inches. 

Male :  Above  brilliant  blue-black,  white  belly,  sides  of  body  and  wing 

linings  salmon-orange^   which   colour  sometimes  flushes  the 

breast.     Some  orange  on  base  of  wings ;   tail  feathers  half 

orange  and  half  black.     Bill  and  feet  black. 
Female:  Brownish  olive  above  and  the  orange  of  the  male  replaced 

by  yellow. 
Song:   Resembling  that  of  the  Yellow  Warbler,   "Sweet,  Sweet, 

Sweeter!"  but  the  word  is  only  used  three  times,  while  it  is 

repeated  seven  times  by  the  Warbler, 
Season :  May  to  September ;  a  common  summer  resident. 
Breeds :  From  middle  United  States  northward. 
Nest :  A  carefully  made  structure  of  moss  fibres  and  sometimes  hors^ 

hair,  set  in  a  forked  branch  usually  about  twenty  feet  from  the 

ground ;  I  have  seen  one  at  the  top  of  a  small  spruce. 
Eggs :  Indistinguishable  from  other  Warblers. 
Bange:  North  America,  north  to  Fort  Simpson,  west  regularly  to 

the  Great  Basin,  casually  to  the  Pacific  Coast;  in  winter  the 

West   Indies,   and    from    southern    Mexico    through    Central 

America  to  northern  South  America. 

Again  the  colour  title  of  a  bird  is  a  misnomer.  Eedstart, 
a  corruption  of  the  German  roth  stert,  red  tail,  being  very  mis- 
leading in  this  day  of  accurate  colour  distinctions.     Mrs.

Olive  Thome  Miller  is  on  the  right  path  when  she  describes 
it  as  wearing  the  Oriole's  colour  combination,  —  except  that 
the  Kedstart  has  a  more  salmonish  cast. 

This  Warbler,  when  it  flutters  through  the  spruces,  seems 
the  veriest  mite  of  creation,  appearing  much  smaller  than 
its  measurements  indicate.  The  female  is  equally  charming 
in  her  brown  and  yellow  habit,  and  together  they  are  one 
of  the  most  interesting  couples  of  the  bird  world,  as  well  as 
being  capital  illustrations  of  perpetual  motion. 

Though  the  Kedstart  is  a  summer  resident  here,  it  is 
more  visibly  abundant  during  the  May  migration,  as  those 
that  breed  retire  from  the  vicinity  of  dwellings  to  nest.  I 
once  found  a  nest  in  process  of  construction  in  a  spruce  in 
a  remote  part  of  the  garden,  and  had  the  satisfaction  of 
seeing  it  completed  and  occupied.  Its  composition  was 
very  similar  to  that  of  the  Yellow  Warbler,  but  smaller, 
and  with  the  addition  of  some  green  moss  which  decorated 
the  outside.  One  of  their  most  characteristic  motions  while 
searching  for  food,  is  to  raise  the  wings  slightly  and  alight 
on  a  higher  branch  or  else  one  a  little  in  the  rear  of  the 
spot  where  they  were  before,  as  if  a  breeze  had  lifted  them. 

In  brilliancy  of  flame-like  colouring  the  Eedstart  only 
yields  precedence  to  the  Scarlet  Tanager,  Baltimore  Oriole, 
and  the  Blackburnian  Warbler,  and,  in  contrast  to  the  dark 
evergreens,  it  seems  a  wind-blown  firebrand,  half  glowing, 
half  charred.

Red-eyed  Vireo:    Vireo  olivaceus, 

Plate  17.     Fig.  2. 
Length:  5.75-6.25  inches. 
Male  and  Female  :  Olive-green  above,  crown  asli  with  a  dark  marginal 

line.     White  line  over  eye  and  a  brownish  stripe  through  it. 

Below  whitish,  shaded  with  greenish  yellow  on  sides  and  on 

under  tail  and  wing  coverts.     The  iris  ruby-red.     Bill  dusky

Season :  Common  summer  resident ;  late  April  through  September.

SONG-BIRDS.  Vireoa 

Breeds :  Through  its  United  States  range  and  northward. 

Nest :  Cup-like,  pensile  in  slender  forked  branch  of  maple,  birch,  or 

apple  tree  ;  made  of  bark  fibres,  cobwebs,  bits  of  paper,  scraps 

of  hornets'  nests,  etc. 
Eggs :  3-5,  usually  4,  white,  with  brown  spots  on  the  larger  end. 
Bange:  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Rocky  Mountains,  north  to 

the  Arctic  regions. 

The  Vireos  are  a  very  interesting  family,  which,  though  it 
may  be  somewhat  overlooked  in  the  general  spring  chorus, 
comes  to  the  front  in  the  latter  part  of  May.  Of  the  six 
Vireos  that  inhabit  New  England,  five  are  reasonably  plenti- 
ful, and  of  these  the  Ked-eyed  is  the  most  familiar.  You 
cannot  fail  to  name  this  Vireo,  for  he  is  omnipresent ;  if  you 
do  not  see  him,  you  hear  him ;  if  he  chances  to  be  silent, 
which  seldom  happens,  he  peers  at  you  with  his  sparkling, 
ruby  eyes  that  look  out  between  a  white  line  and  a  brown 
stripe.  Wilson  Flagg  has  forever  identified  him  with  the 
name  of  the  Preacher^  in  reference  to  his  elocutionary 
powers.  "  You  see  it  —  you  know  it,  —  do  you  hear  me  ? 
Do  you  believe  it?"  he  hears  the  Vireo  say,  and  if  you 
keep  these  words  in  your  mind  you  will  recognize  the  bird 
the  first  time  that  you  hear  his  song. 

May,  June,  July,  and  August,  and  still  this  Vireo  sings 
on ;  in  mid- August  he  does  not  articulate  as  nicely  perhaps, 
but  as  the  month  ends  he  has  recovered  his  speech  and 
delivers  a  farewell  exhortation  in  September. 

Four  pairs  nested  in  the  garden  this  season,  and  after  the 
young  had  flown  the  parents  stayed  about  the  same  trees, 
singing  from  five  in  the  morning  on  through  the  scorching 
noontime  —  when  the  locust  strove  in  vain  to  drone  them 
down  —  until  sunset  sometimes,  never  leaving  the  particu- 
lar tree  where  they  began.  Not  that  they  sit  and  prate  in 
a  state  of  idleness ;  —  far  from  it,  they  are  constantly  glean- 
ing their  daily  bread.  This  is  very  well  for  Matins  and 
Vespers,  but  the  noon  song  becomes  monotonous,  it  is  in  one 
key,  and  there  is  such  a  thing  even  as  too  much  good  conver- 
sation. At  noon  in  summer,  silence  softened  by  the  whis- 
pering leaves  is  best.     At  such  times  the  Vireo  seems  to  me 

117 


Vireos  SONG-BIRDS. 

like  an  over-active  housewife,  who  accompanies  every 
motion  of  her  broom  or  flash  of  her  needle  with  random 
advice,  maxims,  etc.,  having  all  active  gifts,  but  lacking  the 
grace  of  judicious  silence. 

Though  the  Vireo's  pensile  nests  are  usually  built  upon 
one  plan,  —  a  cup  or  little  pocket  in  a  branch  fork,  —  you 
will  never  find  two  alike.  Of  half  a  dozen  collected  in  the 
garden,  one  is  of  cobwebs,  soft  cedar  bark,  and  white 
worsted;  one  of  paper,  fibres,  and  bits  of  hornets'  nest; 
and  a  third  is  a  perfect  collection  of  scraps  of  all  sorts. 

The  Eed-eyed  is  the  largest  of  the  Vireos,  and  may  be 
distinguished  from  the  Warblers,  with  whom  you  will  be 
apt  to  confuse  them,  by  its  heavier  build  and  a  slight 
Shrike-like  hook  at  the  point  of  the  upper  mandible. 

Warbling  Vireo:   Vireo  gilvus. 

Length :  5.50-6  inches. 

Male  and  Female  :  Above  pale  olive-green  ;  head  and  neck  ash  ;  dusky 
line  over  eye.  N'o  bars  on  loings.  Below  dull  yellowish  ;  whiter 
on  throat  and  belly  ;  deeper  on  sides. 

Song :  A  liquid  and  expressive  voice,  but  not  so  powerful  as  the  Red- 
eyed.  "Wilson  Flagg  gives  it  these  words :  "Brig-a-dier — Brig- 
a-dier — Brigate  !  "     The  song  lacks  the  jerky,  colloquial  style. 

Season :  May  to  September  and  early  October. 

Breeds :  Through  its  United  States  range. 

Nest :  Similar  in  construction  and  shape  to  the  Red-eyed,  with  gener- 
ally a  free  use  of  moss ;  in  trees,  usually  at  some  height  from 
the  ground. 

Eggs :  Slightly  smaller ;  otherwise  not  to  be  distinguished  from  the 
last-named  species. 

Bange :  North  America  in  general,  from  the  Fur  Countries  to  Mexico. 

The  Warbling  Vireo  is  a  common  summer  resident,  and  a 
constant  and  delightful  songster,  having  much  more  music 
in  its  voice  than  any  other  member  of  the  family.  It  war- 
hies,  as  its  name  implies,  the  notes  rippling  easily ;  and  an 
air  of  pleasant  mystery  is  given  to  the  performance  by  the 
shyness  that  keeps  the  singer  in  the  leafiest  tree-tops.  Plain- 
ness is  the  chief  characteristic  of  the  plumage  of  this  Vireo ; 
it  has  no  sharply  contrasting  colours,  no  wing  bars,  and  a 

118 


SONG-BIRDS.  Vireos 

dusky  line  through  the  eye.  It  frequents  the  garden  in 
spring  and  at  midsummer,  but  prefers  greater  seclusion  for 
its  nest-building.  When  in  the  garden,  it  invariably  sings 
either  in  the  elms  or  in  a  particular  birch,  locations  that 
the  Purple  Finch  also  chooses.  Samuels  thinks  the  song  of 
these  two  birds  so  identical  that  he  has  frequently  mistaken 
one  for  the  other.  I  partly  agree  with  him ;  but  the  Vireo 
lacks  the  power  and  richness  of  tone  that  the  Einch  pos- 
sesses. I  have  heard  this  Vireo  warbling  with  all  his  might 
while  brooding  on  the  nest. 

There  is  a  lane,  a  mile  away,  that  separates  a  birch  wood 
from  a  clearing,  and  the  Warbling  Vireo  is  housed,  to  his 
complete  satisfaction,  in  the  trees  of  this  border-land.  So 
plentiful  are  they  in  the  birches,  that  it  is  perfectly  safe  in 
late  May  and  June  to  take  people  to  see  and  hear  the  birds 
in  this  haunt,  for  you  are  sure  that  they  will  make  good 
your  promise,  at  least  in  part,  and  give  a  private  concert 
morning  or  afternoon ;  they  decidedly  disapprove  of  evening 
performances. 


The  Philadelphia  Vireo  ( Vireo  philadelphicus)  closely  re- 
sembles this  species,  but  is  very  rare  in  New  England. 

Yellow-throated  Vireo :   Vireo  fiavifrons. 


Length :  5.75-6  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Splendid  yellow  throat  and  upper  breast ;  cheeks 

yellow,  shading  to  olive-green  on  head,  back,  and  shoulders. 

Yellow  line  over  and  around  the  eye.    Wings  and  tail  dark 

brown.    Two  white  hands  on  wings;  tail  edged  with  white. 

Bill  and  feet  lead-coloured. 
Song :  Rather  sad  —  "  Pree6-preea-pree6-preea." 
Season :  Common  summer  resident ;  May  to  September. 
Breeds  :  Through  its  United  States  range. 
Nest  and  Eggs :  Pensile  as  usual,  hut  more  beautifully  finished  than 

that  of  any  other  species ;  usually  at  some  height  from  the 

ground.     Eggs  normal. 
Bangs :  Eastern  United  States,  south,  in  winter,  to  Costa  Rica.

Vireos  SONG-BIRDS. 

The  Yellow-tliroated  Vireo  is  of  a  stout,  vigorous  build, 
and  has  all  the  brilliancy  of  colouring  of  the  Chat.  Though 
in  northern  New  England  it  is  counted  rare,  it  is  quite 
abundant  in  southern  Connecticut,  Kew  York,  and  Penn- 
sylvania. Its  somewhat  melancholy  song  is  varied  by 
cheerful  outbursts;  and  Mr.  Bicknell  says  that  it  is  the 
only  Vireo  that  he  has  noticed  singing  while  on  the 
wing. 

All  authorities  agree  as  to  the  great  beauty  of  the  nest  of 
this  species,  even  though  they  differ  as  to  its  exact  location. 
It  is  considered  to  be  wholly  a  woodland  bird,  loving  tall 
trees  and  running  water,  haunting  the  same  places  as  the 
Solitary  Vireo.  Dr.  Warren  says  that  during  the  migra- 
tions he  has  seen  the  Yellow-throat  in  orchards  and  in  the 
trees  along  sidewalks  and  lawns,  but  that  in  Pennsylvania 
it  breeds  in  the  woods,  nesting  twenty-five  to  thirty  or  forty 
feet  from  the  ground. 

On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Minot  describes  the  nest  as, — 
*^  altogether  one  of  the  prettiest  nests  to  be  found.  It  is 
placed  in  the  fork  of  a  horizontal  branch,  from  three  to 
fifteen  feet  above  the  ground,  as  often  in  the  orchard  as  in 
the  wood  J  though  I  have  found  it  in  pines." 

Blue-headed  Vireo:   Vireo  solitarius. 

Solitary  Vireo. 

Length:  5.26-5.75  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  dark  olive,  head  bluish  gray.  White  line 
from  beak  to  and  around  eye.  Below  white,  with  yellow  wash 
on  sides  and  dusky  tail  and  wings.  Some  tail  feathers  white- 
edged.     Female,  head  dusky  olive. 

Song:  "Pitched  in  a  higher  key  than  the  other  species."  (Steams 
andCoues.) 

Season:  Sometimes  a  summer  resident,  but  common  from  middle 
New  England  south  in  the  migrations  only. 

Breeds :  From  New  England  northward,  and  also  in  the  Middle  States. 

Nest  and  Eggs :  Resembling  those  of  the  last  species,  but  the  nest 
being  sometimes  placed  in  bushes. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  north  to  southern  British 

Provinces ;    in  winter,  south  to  Mexico  and  Guatemala.

SONG-BIRDS.  Vireoa 

This  Vireo,  whose  mark  of  identification  is  an  ash-blue 
crown,  is  by  no  means  as  much  of  a  recluse  as  the  name 
Solitary  would  indicate.  It  does,  indeed,  prefer  remote  and 
swampy  woods,  but,  though  much  rarer  than  the  preceding 
species,  is  often  seen  about  orchards,  and  in  the  migrations 
exhibits  many  of  the  cheerful,  sociable  family  qualities, 
peering  at  you  in  the  woods,  and  often  coming  quite  near  in 
its  rather  anxious  curiosity. 

Its  song  is  of  the  unmistakable  Vireo  type,  but  is  rather 
shrill,  and  is  continued  for  a  long  period ;  according  to  Mr. 
Bicknell,  as  late  as  October  9  on  its  return  migration.  To 
learn  to  judge  accurately  and  quickly  between  the  songs  of 
the  five  Vireos  is  an  accomplishment  that  you  must  not 
expect  to  acquire  until  your  ear  is  thoroughly  seasoned ;  but 
three  of  the  five  —  the  Ked-eyed,  the  Warbling,  and  the 
White-eyed — will  give  you  but  little  trouble. 

White-eyed  Vireo:  Vireo  noveboracensis. 

Length :  5  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  olive-green,  rump  obscurely  yellow.  Below 
white,  sides  of  breast  and  belly  clear  yellow.  Yellow  line  from 
beak  to  and  round  eye.  Two  yellow  wing  bars.  Iris  white. 
Tail  feathers  yellow-edged.     Bill  and  feet  dark  lead-coloured. 

Song :  Colloquial.  "Delivered  with  strong  expression  and  very  vari- 
able in  intonation." 

Season :  May  to  September.    Common  summer  resident. 

Breeds :  Through  its  United  States  range,  but  more  sparingly  in  the 
Northern  States. 

Nest  and  Eggs :  Similar  to  the  Red-eyed,  but  in  a  low  bush  or  vine ; 
eggs  decidedly  smaller  than  the  other  species. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States,  west  to  the  Rocky  Mountains,  north 
to  southern  New  England  and  Minnesota ;  south  in  winter  to 
Guatemala.     Resident  in  the  Bermudas. 

This  small,  nervous  Vireo,  with  a  Wren's  vehement  scold- 
ing powers,  is  a  common  garden  and  wood-lot  bird,  taking 
refuge  in  bushy  places  like  the  Chat,  Catbird,  and  Maryland 
Yellow-throat.  In  other  parts  of  New  England  it  is  rare 
in  varying  degrees.  Dr.  J.  A.  Allen,  writing  of  it  from 
Springfield,  Mass.,  says  that  out  of  a  thousand  of  the  smaller 
land-birds  taken  during  three  years  by  different  collectors 

121 


Shrike  SONG-BIRDS. 

not  a  single  White-eyed  Vireo  was  found  among  them.  It 
is  at  times  noisily  talkative,  and  prefers  the  tangle  to  the 
tree-tops,  managing,  however,  to  give  great  expression  to  its 
simple  song;  sometimes  scolding  and  arguing,  and  then 
dropping  voice,  as  if  talking  to  itself. 

Without  having  the  imitative  and  ventriloquistic  powers 
of  the  Chat,  you  cannot  fail  to  be  reminded  of  that  exasper- 
ating gamin  when  the  White-eyed  Vireo,  ambushed  in  some 
blackberry  tangle  and  trembling  for  the  safety  of  his  nest, 
undertakes  to  give  you  a  piece  of  his  mind.

Butcher-bird. 

Plate  21. 

Length:  9-10.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Powerful  head,  neck,  and  blackish  beak  with 
hooked  point.  Above  bluish  ash,  lighter  on  the  rump  and 
shoulders.  Wide  black  bar  on  each  side  of  head  from  the  eye 
backward.  Below  light  gray  with  a  brownish  cast,  broken  on 
breast  and  sides  by  waved  lines  of  darker  gray.  Wings  aoid 
tail  black,  edged  and  tipped  with  white.  Large  white  spot  on 
wings,  white  tips  and  edges  to  outer  quills  of  tail.  Legs  bluish 
black. 

Song :  A  call  note,  and  in  its  breeding-haunts  a  sweet,  warbling  song. 

Season :  A  roving  winter  resident ;  seen  from  November  to  April. 

Breeds :  North  of  the  United  States. 

Nest :  In  a  low  bush  ;  a  basis  of  sticks,  upon  which  is  matted  and  felted 
a  thick,  warm  superstructure  of  bark-strip,  grass,  and  soft  vege- 
table substance.     (Coues.) 

Eggs :  4-6 ;  marblings  of  reddish  brown  and  purple  covering  the  gray- 
green  ground. 

Bange :  Northern  North  America,  south  in  winter  to  the  middle  por- 
tions of  the  United  States  (Washington,  D.C.,  Kentucky, 
Kansas,  Colorado,  Arizona,  northern  California). 

The  Northern  Shrike,  though  somewhat  irregular  in  its 
comings  and  goings,  is  always  present  in  varying  numbers 
as  a  winter  resident.     In  common  with  all  winter  birds,  its 

122 


SONG-BIRDS.  Shrike 

movements  are  guided  by  the  food  supply,  and  if  severe 
cold  and  heavy  snows  drive  away  the  small  birds  and  bury 
the  mice  upon  which  it  feeds,  the  Shrike  must  necessarily 
rove. 

Grasshoppers,  beetles,  other  large  insects,  and  field  mice 
are  staple  articles  of  its  food  in  seasons  when  they  are  ob- 
tainable ;  in  fact,  next  to  insects,  mice  constitute  the  staple 
article  of  its  diet,  and  protection  should  be  accorded  it  on 
this  account,  even  though  we  know  the  Shrike  chiefly  as 
the  killer  of  small  birds.  The  victims  are  caught  by  two 
methods:  sneaking,  —  after  the  fashion  of  Crows,  —  and 
dropping  upon  them  suddenly  from  a  height  like  the  small 
Hawks.  In  the  former  case  the  Shrikes  frequent  clumps  of 
bushes,  either  in  open  meadows  or  gardens,  lure  the  little 
birds  by  imitating  their  call  notes,  and  then  seize  them  as 
soon  as  they  come  within  range.  They  often  kill  many 
more  birds  than  they  can  possibly  eat  at  a  meal,  and  hang 
them  on  the  spikes  of  a  thorn  or  on  the  hooks  of  a  cat-briar 
in  some  convenient  spot,  until  they  are  needed,  in  the  same 
manner  as  a  butcher  hangs  his  meat,  and  from  this  trait  the 
name  Butcher-bird  was  given  them. 

Their  depredations  are  by  no  means  confined  to  lonely 
fields  and  gardens.  I  was  told  by  a  friend  living  in  Chicago, 
that  last  winter  a  Shrike  visited  her  back  y^rd  regularly  in 
search  of  English  Sparrows.  He  would  hide  in  the  bushes, 
and,  after  killing  half  a  dozen  Sparrows,  impaled  them  on 
the  frozen  twigs  of  a  lilac  bush.  After  they  had  hung  a 
few  days,  he  eat  portions  of  them,  and  then  proceeded  to 
kill  more,  a  proceeding  for  which  he  should  receive  un- 
limited applause. 

In  the  Hawk-like  method  of  killing,  the  Shrike  sits  motion- 
less upon  the  bare  branch  of  a  high  tree,  and,  as  the  little 
birds  pass  unconsciously  underneath,  he  drops  upon  one 
with  unerring  aim.  He  will  also  try  to  seize  cage  birds 
that  are  hung  out  of  doors  or  even  inside  the  window. 
Last  spring  I  was  startled  by  a  violent  blow,  struck  upon  a 
window  near  which  a  Canary's  cage  stood  upon  a  chair. 
The  Canary  was  trembling  with  fright,  and  on  going  outside

Waxwing  SONG-BIRDS. 

I  found  some  Shrike's  feathers,  with  their  wavy  markings, 
adhering  to  the  glass.  He  had  evidently  swooped  without 
taking  the  heavy  glass  into  his  calculations,  and  had  bruised 
his  breast. 

Twice  only,  in  middle  April,  I  have  heard  the  Shrike's 
real  song;  the  notes  are  soft  and  very  musical,  and  our 
bird-loving  Danish  gardener  tells  me  that  in  his  country  the 
native  species  is  prized  as  a  cage  bird  and  often  shows

Cedar  Waxwing:  Ampelis  cedrorutn. 

Cedar-bird. 

Plate  22. 

Length:  6.50-7.25  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  grayish  cinnamon.  Crest,  breast,  throat, 
wings,  and  tail,  purplish  cinnamon.  Black  line  from  back  of 
crest,  extending  through  eye,  and  forming  black  frontlets. 
Secondary  wing  quills  tipped  with  waxy  points.  Tail  feathers 
banded  with  yellow,  and  sometimes  red  tips.  Bill  and  feet 
black. 

Song :  A  buzzing  call,  —  "Twee,  twe^-zee."  "  A  dreary  whisper," 
Minot  calls  it. 

Season :  A  resident,  breeding  here,  and  wandering  about  in  flocks  the 
remainder  of  the  year,  feeding  upon  various  fruits,  and  in  win- 
ter upon  cedar  berries. 

Breeds :  Irregularly  through  its  North  American  range. 

Nest :  A  deep  bowl  made  of  twigs,  lined  with  gi-ass  and  feathers,  and 
much  miscellaneous  material,  either  in  a  crotch,  or  saddled  on 
the  limb  of  a  stout  cedar  bush  or  a  tree,  preferably  the  apple 
tree. 

Eggs :  3-5,  blue-white,  with  brown  and  lilac  spots. 

Bange :  North  America  at  large,  from  the  Fur  Countries  southward ; 
in  winter,  south  to  Guatemala  and  the  West  Indies. 

You  will  at  once  recognize  the  Cedar  Waxwing  by  its  crest, 

yellow  tail  tips,  red  wing  appendages,  and  straight  black 
bill.  Its  feathers  are  more  exquisitely  shaded  than  those  of 
our  more  brilliantly  coloured  birds.     The  specimen  I  have

before  me  is  a  male  in  full  plumage,  who  came  to  an  un- 
timely end  by  flying  against  a  treaxiherous  wire  trellis. 
Nowhere  except  in  the  black  frontlet,  the  tail,  and  wing 
tips  does  he  show  a  distinct  colour  demarcation;  all  the 
rest  of  the  feathers  are  tinted  like  a  skilful  blending  of 
water-colours.  The  Cedar  Waxwings  only  remain  in  pairs 
during  the  breeding-season  (from  late  May  until  August), 
and  at  other  times  travel  in  flocks.  It  is  only  when  in 
these  flocks  that  they  are  conspicuous  about  the  garden  and 
old  pastures ;  for  when  they  are  nesting  they  are  very  shy 
and  stealthy  in  their  movements. 

Last  May  a  flock  of  fifty  or  more  lodged  for  a  whole  morn- 
ing in  a  half-dead  ash  tree,  near  the  house,  so  that  seated  at 
ease,  I  could  focus  my  glass  carefully,  and  watch  them  at 
leisure.  They  were  as  solemn  as  so  many  demure  Quakers 
sitting  stiffly  in  rows ;  once  in  a  while  they  shifted  about, 
and  then  seemed  to  do  a  great  deal  of  apologizing  for  fan- 
cied jostlings.  Their  movements  interested  me  greatly, 
until  finally,  to  my  surprise,  I  saw  an  illustration  of  the  old 
story  of  their  extreme  politeness  in  passing  food  to  one 
another,  which  I  had  always  regarded  as  a  pretty  bit  of 
fiction.  A  stout  green  worm  (for  they  eat  animal  as  well  as 
vegetable  food)  was  passed  up  and  down  a  row  of  eight 
birds ;  once,  twice  it  went  the  rounds,  until  half  way  on  its 
third  trip  it  became  a  wreck  and  dropped  to  the  ground,  so 
that  no  one  enjoyed  it,  —  a  commentary,  in  general,  upon 
useless  ceremony.  I  could  not  help  wondering,  however, 
whether  it  was  all  disinterested  politeness,  or  whether  the 
worm  was  of  a  variety  repugnant  to  Cedar-birds  ;  as  Hamlet 
put  it,  "  Caviare  to  the  general."

Martin  SONG-BIRDS. 

Song :  Very  soft  and  musical,  beginning  "peuo-peuo-peuo.** 

Season :  Late  April  to  early  September. 

Breeds  :  Through  range,  rearing  two  broods  a  season. 

Nest :  A  little  heap  of  leaves ;  in  the  East  in  boxes,  but  in  the  West 

in  hollow  trees. 
Eggs :  4-6,  glossy  white. 
Iia7ige :  Temperate  North  America,  south  to  Mexico. 

Without  being  precisely  a  common  bird,  the  Purple 
Martin  is  with  us  every  summer,  and  its  iridescent  coat  is 
a  familiar  sight.  Its  size  and  colour  easily  separate  it  from 
the  rest  of  the  family,  and  the  sweet  song  completes  the 
identification. 

A  little  after  dawn,  in  early  May,  you  may  see  pairs  of 
these  Martins  hovering  in  mid-air,  half  caressing,  half  quar- 
relling, while  from  time  to  time  you  will  hear  the  liquid 
"  peuo-peuo-peuo  "  merging  into  a  more  throaty  ripple,  like 
laughter. 

The  Martin  is  a  favourite,  and  always  seems  to  have  been 
regarded  as  such.  Houses  are  provided  for  his  shelter, 
children  are  cautioned  not  to  molest  him,  and  the  farmer, 
usually  so  callous  toward  bird  attractions,  has  no  word  for 
him  but  of  praise;  as  he  consumes  a  vast  quantity  of 
evil  insects,  and  these,  too,  of  a  larger  size  and  different 
class  from  those  captured  by  other  Swallows,  and  he  does 
not  claim  a  single  bud  or  berry  to  discount  his  utility. 

Even  among  the  wild  men  he  was  always  a  protected 
guest.  Wilson  relates  that  the  Choctaw  and  Chickasaw 
Indians  used  to  strip  the  leaves  from  small  trees  near 
their  encampments,  and  hang  upon  the  prongs,  hollowed- 
out  gourds  that  the  Martins  might  nest  in  them,  and  the 
Mississippi  negroes  also  hung  similar  contrivances  on  long 
canes  to  coax  the  Martin  to  stay. 

The  Purple  Martin  is  as  courageous  as  the  Kingbird  in 
attacking  Crows  and  Hawks,  but  for  all  this  he  seems 
unable  to  cope  with  the  English  Sparrow,  who  is  steadily 
and  persistently  appropriating  his  houses.  The  Sparrow 
has  the  advantage  of  being  more  prolific,  as  well  as  more 
gross  and  brutal  in  its  methods,  and  represents  in  the  bird

Male  and  Female  :  Above  brilliant  steel-blue  ;  beneath  dusky  white. 
Sides  of  head,  throat  and  chin  rufous.  Wings  and  tail  glossed

let, hence  its  specific  name  lunifrons,  from  luna,  the  moon,  and 
frons,  front. 

Song  :  A  squeak,  more  than  a  twitter. 

Season  :  Early  April  to  late  August. 

Breeds  :  In  colonies,  raising  two  broods  a  year. 

Nest :  Either  a  bracket,  or  gourd-shaped,  with  the  opening  at  the  neck  ; 
of  mud,  with  straws  and  feather-lined ;  placed  under  eaves  or 
rocky  cliSs. 

Eggs :  4-6,  white  with  brown  and  purple  markings. 

Bange  :  North  America  at  large,  south  in  winter  to  Brazil  and  Para- 
guay. 

This  familiar  Swallow,  which  we  in  the  East  know  as  the 
bird  who  builds  its  much-modified,  gourd-shaped  nest  under 
the  eaves  of  old  houses,  is  in  the  West  wholly  a  cliff-dweller. 
With  us  the  shape  of  the  nest  depends  greatly  upon  the  site 
chosen,  many  nests  being  merely  elongated  brackets.  When 
it  builds  under  the  protection  of  shelving  cliffs,  the  nests  are 
of  the  typical  bottle  shape,  and  are  often  squeezed  as  closely 
together  as  the  cells  of  a  wasp  nest. 

This  species  is  almost  as  brilliantly  coloured  as  the  Barn 
Swallow,  but  lacks  the  grace  in  flying  which  the  sharply 
forked  tail  gives  to  the  latter.  Like  all  its  tribe,  it  feeds 
upon  insects,  which  it  takes  on  the  wing.

white  band  from  beneath.    Female  smaller  and  paler. 
Song :  A  musical  twitter  like  a  rippling,  merry  laugh,  —  "  Tittle-ittle- 

ittle-eS." 
Season  :  April  to  September. 
Breeds:  Everywhere. 
Nest :  A  shallow  bracket,  made  of  pellets  of  mud  and  straw,  placed 

on  or  against  rafters,  etc. 
Eggs :  4-6,  white,  curiously  spotted  with  all  shades  of  brown  and 

lilac. 
Mange  :  North  America  in  general,  from  the  Fur  Countries  southward 

to  the  West  Indies,  Central  America,  and  South  America. 

The  Swallows  belong  to  the  air,  as  the  Warblers  do  to  the 
trees  and  the  Thrushes  to  the  ground.  Swallows,  unless 
when  gathering  before  the  fall  migration,  are  seldom  seen 
perching,  except  upon  telegraph  wires,  and  they  leave  these 
with  such  sudden  and  forking  flight  that  they  seem  spurred 
by  the  electric  current.  If,  in  the  daylight  hours,  you  see 
a  bird  in  rapid  but  nonchalant  pursuit  of  insects,  you  may 
safely  assume  that  it  is  either  a  Swallow  or  the  Chimney 
Swift,  for  the  Flycatchers  have  a  different  flight,  the  Night- 
hawk  is  more  ponderous,  and  Whip-poor-wills  seldom  take 
to  the  air  between  dawn  and  dusk. 

The  distinguishing  mark  of  the  Barn  Swallow  is  his  sharply 
forked  tail,  brick-red  throat,  and  buff  breast.  It  is  the  com- 
monest species  and  the  most  familiar,  owing  to  the  fact  that 
it  builds  so  freely  about  barns  and  dwellings.  Its  nest  is 
one  of  the  earliest  that  country  children  learn  to  know ;  and 
the  first  eggs  that  many  a  boy  has  stolen  and  concealed, 
while  his  conscience  was  still  keen  enough  to  prick  him, 
have  been  those  of  the  Barn  Swallow. 

Several  broods  are  sometimes  raised  in  a  season,  the  hatch- 
ing continuing  to  late  July.  In  fact,  the  last  brood  has  en- 
tered the  world,  through  our  hayloft  window,  the  first  week 
in  August.  These  Swallows  have  very  sympathetic  natures ; 
for  when  danger  threatens  or  disaster  destroys  a  brood,  the 
friends  quickly  gather  about  and  seem  to  offer  advice  or 
condolence.

—  Greek  Swallow  Song,  J.  A.  Stmonds,  Trans. 

The  Tree,  or  White-bellied  Swallow  seems  nearly  to  cor- 
respond with  the  bird  which,  was  the  herald  of  spring  in 
Greece ;  for  though  our  Swallow  is  a  beautiful  green  above, 
except  when  at  close  range  or  when  the  light  glances  across 
its  feathers,  it  appears  black.  The  Tree  Swallow,  in  times 
before  the  country  was  inhabited  by  white  men,  like  many 
of  its  family,  lived  in  hollow  trees,  but  it  now  nests  in  Martin 
boxes  and  other  convenient  nooks,  though  it  may  be  still 
found  colonizing  in  old  sycamores  and  willows. 

If  you  live  near  the  sand  dunes  or  by  a  strip  of  beach 
edged  with  scrub  bushes,  go  out  and  watch  the  gyrations  of 
these  lovely  Swallows  before  the  fall  migration,  the  first 
part  of  September ;  you  may  also  see  the  Bank  Swallows  or 
Sand  Martins  gather  at  the  same  time. 

The  Tree  Swallow  always  seeks  the  vicinity  of  water  at 
the  time  of  the  migration,  probably  because  insects  are  more 
plentiful  in  such  places.  This  has  led  people  to  form  the

theory  that  it  passed  the  winter  under  the  mud  bottom  of 
large  ponds  and  rivers  in  a  state  of  hibernation.  The  mat- 
ter has  even  been  treated  seriously,  in  spite  of  its  manifest 
absurdity,  the  construction  of  the  bird's  breathing-apparatus 
precluding  such  a  possibility.

Length :  5  inches.    The  smallest  of  our  Swallows. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  dull  mouse  colour,  wings  and  tail  brownish, 

below  white,  with  a  brownish  breast  band.    Bill  and  feet  dark. 
Song :  A  giggling  twitter. 

Season  :  Common  summer  resident,  arriving  in  May. 
Breeds :  All  through  its  North  American  range. 
iVesf ;  In  tunnelled  holes  in  clayey  banks ;  made  of  grass  and  lined 

with  a  few  feathers. 
Eggs :  4-6,  pure  white. 
Mange  :  Northern  Hemisphere  ;  in  America,  south  to  the  West  Indies, 

Central  America,  and  northern  South  America. 

The  Bank  Swallow  is  the  plainest,  as  well  as  the  smallest, 
of  the  family.  His  back  is  the  colour  of  the  damp  mottled 
gray  sand  with  which  he  is  closely  associated,  and  he  shows 
no  glints  of  purple,  steel-blue,  and  buff,  like  his  brethren, 
but  wears  a  dusky  cloak  fastened  about  his  throat  with  a 
band  of  the  same  colour. 

There  is  always  a  large  colony  of  these  Swallows  near 
Southport,  where  Sasco  Hill  is  cut  off  abruptly  by  the 
Sound.  The  bank  is  high,  and  shows  a  face  of  various 
grades  of  loam  and  some  strata  of  gravel ;  below  there  is  a 
bit  of  stony  beach,  bare  at  low  tides,  but  in  storms  the 
water  breaks  half-way  up  the  bank.  A  few  feet  above  high- 
water  mark  you  can  see  the  holes  in  the  bank  which  are  the 
entrances  to  the  Swallows'  nests.  They  are  not  arranged 
with  any  sort  of  regularity,  but  the  birds  have  chosen  inva- 
riably the  stiff  loam,  which  was  the  least  likely  to  crumble 
away  in  the  boring-process.    None  of  the  tunnels  are  within 

130 


SONG-BIRDS.  Tanager 

three  feet  of  the  top,  and  they  are  almost  all  wider  than 
they  are  high,  as  is  frequently  the  case  with  mouse-holes. 
These  tunnels  vary  from  a  foot  to  eighteen  inches  in  length, 
and  at  the  end  are  the  wisps  of  grass  and  feathers  that 
hold  the  fragile  white  eggs.  The  feathers  of  many  different 
birds  are  found  in  the  nests  of  this  colony,  —  the  breast- 
feathers  of  Ducks,  Gulls,  and  various  Shore-birds,  which  are 
not  in  this  vicinity  at  the  Swallow's  nesting-time.  In  the 
autumn  and  winter  many  Water-birds  are  wounded  by  gun- 
ners, but  escape  notice,  and,  drifting  ashore,  become  wedged 
between  rocks  and  stones,  and  I  think  that  it  is  mainly 
from  the  scraps  of  down  adhering  to  such  carcasses  that 
this  colony  lines  its  nests. 

The  Swallows,  as  a  family,  show  great  inventive  qualities 
in  the  way  in  which  they  have  adapted  their  habits  to  the 
encroachments  of  civilization.  Now,  almost  wholly  domes- 
ticated, they  seem  to  prefer  man's  company,  and  each  one 
has  appropriated  a  separate  location  for  nesting.  The  Bank 
Swallow  adheres  the  most  closely  to  his  original  haunts; 
but  even  he  may  be  found  occasionally  building  under  a 
bridge. 


The  Eough-winged  Swallow  is  another  species,  which 
closely  resembles  the  Bank  Swallow,  being  slightly  larger ; 
but,  as  you  would  scarcely  distinguish  it  when  on  the  wing, 
it  does  not  need  a  separate  description.

Tanager  SONG-BIRDS. 

Breeds :  Through  its  United  States  range. 

Kest :  Rather  flat  and  ragged  ;  made  of  sticks,  root  fibres,  etc. ;  placed 

on  the  high  horizontal  branch,  preferably  of  an  oak  or  pine. 
Eggs :  3-5,  dull  green,  thickly  spotted  with  brown  and  mauve. 
Bange:  Eastern  United  States,  west  to  the  Plains,  and  north  to 

southern  Canada  ;  in  winter  the  West  Indies,  Central  America, 

and  northern  South  America. 

A  few  years  ago  the  Scarlet  Tanager  was  as  familiar 
hereabout  as  the  Yellow  Warbler,  or  the  Wood  Thrush; 
but  now  it  has,  in  a  great  measure,  left  the  gardens  and 
frequented  woodlands,  and  become  the  resident  of  lonely- 
woods.  Together  with  all  of  our  brilliantly  plumed  birds, 
it  has  been  persecuted  almost  out  of  existence.  oSTow  that 
this  bird  slaughter  is  against  the  law  in  all  communities 
that  pretend  to  be  civilized,  the  killing  is  at  least  abated, 
but  the  Tanager's  confidence  in  humanity  has  not  yet 
returned. 

It  is  impossible  to  mistake  this  bird  in  full  spring  dress, 
for  any  other.  His  fall  coat,  however,  is  olivaceous  like  the 
female,  and,  as  for  the  unmoulted  young,  they  are  a  motley 
lot,  mainly  olive-green,  but  with  little  tufts  of  scarlet,  yellow, 
and  bright  green,  appearing  at  random,  as  if  they  were  exam- 
ples of  feather  patchwork.  It  is  easy  to  see  the  wisdom 
that  clothes  the  female  and  young  of  this  flaming  Tanager 
in  sober  colours.  If  a  brooding  female  wore  a  scarlet  cover- 
ing, it  would  surely  betray  the  nest  to  all  enemies ;  and  if 
the  young  were  likewise  conspicuous,  they  would  be  gobbled 
by  Hawks  before  they  understood  that  Hawks  are  hardly 
friendly. 

The  Tanager,  though  of  a  brilliant  scarlet,  lacks  the 
luminous  quality  that  reveals  the  Baltimore  Oriole  and 
Blackburnian  Warbler,  when  partly  concealed  in  dark  green 
foliage;  you  will  be  most  likely  to  find  it  in  a  grove  of 
oaks,  hickories,  or  swamp-maples,  where  there  is  an  under- 
growth of  ferns,  —  not  briars,  —  near  by  a  stream  or  flag- 
edged  pond.  It  is  a  fruit  and  berry  eater,  as  well  as  the 
consumer  of  beetles,  and  other  large  winged  insects,  together 
with  many  larvae.

brilliant  birds  are  rare.  It  is  a  resident  of  northern  New 
England,  and,  however  much  it  may  wander  about  in  the 
more  southern  states,  it  can  only  be  regarded  as  an  irregular 
and  capricious  migrant. 

The  song  of  this  species  is  said  to  be  very  attractive,  but 
is  of  course  seldom  heard  so  far  away  from  the  breeding- 
haunts.  Mr.  Bicknell  calls  it  a  subdued,  rattling  warble, 
which  is  sometimes  heard  as  early  as  February  and  March, 
and  Dr.  Coues  calls  the  birds  fine  musicians.  They  come 
in  pairs  or  in  flocks,  and  as  the  young  males  do  not  attain 
their  strawberry-coloured  feathers  until  the  second  year, 
and  the  females  are  a  brownish  yellow,  the  proportion  of 
red  birds  in  these  flocks  is  quite  small. 

Severely  cold  winters  and  strong  gales  seem  to  blow  them 
down  to  us ;  a  number  appeared  here  in  the  snowy  season 
of  1892-93,  while  in  the  open  winter  of  1893-94  I  did  not

see  or  hear  of  one.  Twice  I  have  noticed  pairs  keeping 
together  and  apart  from  the  flock.  In  January,  1893,  when 
the  snow  had  been  on  the  ground  since  November,  two 
pairs  roosted  nightly  in  a  very  thick  honeysuckle.  In  the 
day  the  birds  spent  their  time  between  an  arbor-vitae  hedge 
and  a  group  of  pines.  After  an  unusually  severe  snow 
they  became  very  hungry  and  descended  to  the  ground  for 
food,  and,  while  they  refused  to  eat  criunbs,  relished  some 
cracked  corn  which  had  been  soaked  in  boiling  water  until 
it  was  partly  softened. 

Aside  from  their  striking  size  and  colour,  and  the  fact 
that  they  come  in  winter,  a  season  at  which  any  bird  is  a  wel- 
come excitement,  these  Grosbeaks  are  not  very  interesting. 
They  have  no  playful  ways,  and  here,  at  least,  are  silent  to 
the  verge  of  stupidity.  They  feed  upon  various  small  seeds 
and  also  upon  tree  buds,  particularly  those  of  the  maple  and 
hickory.     Berries  are  also  eaten,  if  other  food  fails. 

Purple  Finch :  Carpodacus  purpureus* 


Length :  5.75-6.25  inches. 

Male:  Until  two  years  old  resembles  a  dull-coloured,  heavy-billed 

sparrow ;  when  mature,  the  head,  shoulders,  and  upper  breast 

have  a  wash  of  raspberry-red,  lower  parts  grayish  white,  wings 

and  tail  dusky  with  some  reddish  brown  tips.     Bill  and  feet 

brown. 
Female :  Olive-brown,  clearer  on  rump,  and  streaked  above  and  below 

with  dusky  brown.     Whitish  beneath,  and  streaked  on  sides  of 

breast  with  arrow-shaped  marks. 
Song :  Joyful  and  sudden,  —  "  O,  list  to  me,  list  to  me,  hear  me,  and 

I'll  tell  you, — you,  you  !  '* 
Season :  March  to  November  ;  a  common  summer  resident,  individuals 

remaining  sometimes  all  winter. 
Breeds :  From  Middle  States  northward. 
Nest :  In  a  bush  or  tree,  of  grass  and  fibre,  and  lined  with  horsehair ; 

a  flat  nest. 
Eggs:  4-5,  greenish   white,  scratched  and  spotted  with  black  and 

lilac. 
Bange:  Eastern  North  America,   from  the  Atlantic  coast  to   the 

Plains.

SONG-BIRDS.  Purple  Finch 

This  is  the  most  melodious  of  the  Finches,  who,  perching 
high  in  the  elms  on  the  lawn  or  in  the  birches  by  the  river- 
bank,  pours  out  his  gushing,  liquid  warble,  while  at  the  same 
time  he  is  completely  hidden  from  sight.  Long  ago,  being 
told  that  a  song  which  had  delighted  me  belonged  to  the 
Purple  Finch,  I  tried  to  obtain  a  good  view  of  him,  expect- 
ing to  see  a  bird  whose  purple  coat  should  match  his  regal 
voice,  —  but  not  at  all.  The  first  specimen  that  I  caught 
(with  my  field-glass),  when  in  the  act  of  singing,  was  dull 
and  Sparrow-like.  Then  followed  the  explanation  that  the 
males  take  two  seasons  to  perfect  their  plumage,  and  that 
even  then  they  are  not  purple,  but  merely  washed  locally 
with  a  peculiar  shade  of  red. 

I  think  many  early  ornithologists  who  were  responsible 
for  the  naming  of  our  birds  must  have  been  either  colour- 
blind or  possessed  of  very  limited  vocabularies,  for  a  modern 
reading  of  many  of  their  colour  terms  means  dismay  and 
total  collapse  to  the  unfortunate  novice.  Burroughs,  with 
his  fine  sense  of  perception  and  language  combined,  at  once 
locates  this  Finch.  "  His  colour  is  peculiar,"  he  says,  "  and 
looks  as  if  it  might  have  been  imparted  by  dipping  a  brown 
bird  in  diluted  poke-berry  juice.  Two  or  three  more  dip- 
pings would  have  made  the  purple  complete." 

In  looking  for  this  Finch,  then,  you  must  rely  greatly 
upon  his  song,  remembering  that  he  may  or  may  not  be  red 
coloured  on  the  head  and  back,  and  that  whether  he  is  or 
not,  you  will  find  it  difficult  to  discover. 

The  suddenness  with  which  the  Purple  Finch  bursts  into 
song  renders  him  one  of  our  most  conspicuous  songsters, 
and  recalls  the  notes  of  the  English  Chaffinch.  May  and 
June  are  the  months  of  his  most  perfect  music,  but  the 
birds  who  have  wintered  here  begin  to  warble  early  in  March, 
and  occasional  subdued  songs  may  be  heard  in  October,  so 
that  the  season  of  melody  is  almost  as  long  as  that  of  the 
Song  Sparrow.

English  Sparrow  SONG-BIRDS. 

English  Sparrow  :    Passer  domesticus. 

House  Sparrow;  Gamin,  Tramp,  Hoodlum.     (Coues.) 

Length :  5  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Ashy  above,  shoulders  and  back  striped  with 

black  and  chestnut.     Dark  chestnut  mark  over  eye  and  on 

sides  of  neck.     Chestnut  and  white  bar  on  wings,  bordered  by 

a  black  line ;  tail  gray.     Bill  blue-black ;  feet  brown.    Female 

paler  ;  wing  bars  indistinct. 
Song :  A  harsh  chirp. 
Season :  A  persistent  resident. 
Breeds :  Everywhere  in  towns  and  in  villages. 
Nest:  Rough,  and  loosely  made  of  straws,  sticks,  or  any  material 

which  circumstances  offer. 
Eggs :  4-8,  greenish  white,  speckled  with  chocolate  and  lavender. 
Mange :  Eastern  United  States.    Introduced  about  twenty  years  ago 

into  the  United  States,  where  it  has  become  naturalized  in 

nearly  all  inhabited  districts. 

This  unfortunate  Sparrow,  bearing  a  load  of  opprobrium 
■wMch  he  deserves,  though  largely  through  no  fault  of  his 
own,  has  for  some  time  been  furnishing  an  avi-social  prob- 
lem to  both  England  and  America.  In  the  first-named 
country,  even  the  investigation  of  a  special  committee  of 
the  House  of  Commons  has  failed  to  ascertain,  with  any- 
thing approaching  certainty,  whether  this  Sparrow's  services 
as  an  insect-destroyer  equal  his  own  destructive  qualities. 

In  Australia,  it  is  said  that  the  fifty  birds  originally  im- 
ported now  flock  by  millions,  and  make  the  third  of  the 
triad  of  emigrants  with  which  unthinking  people  have' 
scourged  the  country,  the  other  two  being  rabbits  and  the 
Scotch  thistle. 

Here  in  America,  the  Sparrow  is  an  absolute  and  unmiti- 
gated nuisance,  but  for  this,  the  unwise  and  superficial 
theory  that  brought  him  over  is  chiefly  to  blame.  No 
thought  was  given  to  the  change  of  habits  that  the  change 
of  climate  might  effect  in  the  bird's  whole  nature.  A  par- 
tial insect-eater,  at  home,  though  of  a  seed-eating  family, 
brought  here  to  free  the  trees  from  canker-worms,  he, 
instead,  relapsed  soon  after,  and  became  a  rigid  seed-eater.

AMERICAN   CROSSBILL. 


SONG-BIRDS.  Crossbill 

Theodore  Wood,  in  his  instructive  little  book,  — "  Our 
Bird  Allies,"^ — devotes  two  chapters  to  an  unprejudiced 
review  of  the  Sparrow  question,  which  are  well  worth  read- 
ing, in  which  he  quotes  Prevost-Paradol  and  many  other 
authorities.  "What  wonder,"  he  says,  "if  the  Sparrow, 
both  in  America  and  New  Zealand,  should  turn  from  a  diet 
of  insect  to  one  of  grain  and  fruit?  Does  not  even  man 
himself  alter  his  food  in  accordance  with  the  climate? 
Does  he  not,  leaving  England  for  a  warmer  country,  depend 
more  upon  vegetable  food  and  less  upon  animal  ?  " 

It  is  not  the  grain  that  he  consumes  that  makes  us 
at  war  with  the  Sparrow,  but  because  he  steadily  puts  to 
rout  our  most  familiar  birds,  destroys  their  young,  and 
gives  us  only  his  ugly  chirp  in  the  place  of  their  songs, 
and  his  useless  presence  instead  of  their  insect-consuming 
powers.  The  destruction  of  the  Sparrows,  eggs  and  nests,  is 
now  almost  universally  approved  in  the  United  States.  Dr. 
C.  Hart  Merriam  of  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  Wash- 
ington, has  prepared  a  consensus  of  reports  from  many 
sources,  containing  evidence  for  and  against  the  Sparrow, 
— 168  being  for,  837  against,  and  43  neutral.  The  report 
also  contains  a  list  of  native  birds  that  have  been  more  or 
less  molested  by  the  Sparrow,  among  which  are  not  only 
the  Wrens,  Bluebirds,  and  Martins  of  our  garden  bird- 
boxes,  but  the  valiant  Kingbird,  the  Horned  Lark,  Hermit 
and  Wood  Thrushes,  the  Mockingbird,  Purple  Grackle, 
Meadowlark,  and  many  Woodpeckers.

Redpoll  SONG-BIRDS. 

Song :  Winter  note  ;  a  snapping  chirp. 

Season :  An  irregular  winter  visitor. 

Breeds :  Northward  in  late  winter  and  early  spring. 

Nest :  Among  the  twigs  or  in  the  fork  of  a  tree,  having  a  base  of  bark 

and  sticks,  and  being  lined  with  finer  materials. 
Eggs :  3-4,  greenish,  marked  with  brown  and  lilac  at  larger  end. 
Eange :  Northern  North  America ;  resident  sparingly  south   in  the 

Eastern  States  to  Maryland  and  Tennessee,  and  in  the  Alle- 

ghanies ;  irregularly  abundant  in  winter ;  resident  south  in  the 

Rocky  Mountains  to  Colorado. 

This  bird  of  evergreens  and  cold  weather,  the  Red  Cross- 
bill, is  chiefly  a  winter  visitor  here,  varying  greatly  in  abun- 
dance. It  is  impossible  to  confuse  it  with  any  other  bird, 
as  the  colour  is  of  a  different  shade  from  the  red  of  the 
Pine  Finch  and  Cardinal,  and  its  warped  bill  is  a  distinctive 
mark.  The  beak  seems  especially  constructed  for  snapping 
the  scales  from  the  cones,  whose  seeds  furnish  its  food. 

A  very  strange  effect  is  produced  when  a  flock  of  Cross- 
bills settle  in  the  pines  north  of  the  garden,  and  mingle 
their  snapping  chirp  with  the  dry  crackling  of  the  cones 
that  they  are  dissecting.  There  is  a  suppressed  bustle  about 
the  whole  proceeding  ;  and  if  you  close  your  eyes  you  may 
imagine  that  the  sounds  proceed  from  the  rending  of  the 
corn  from  the  stalk  at  an  old  time  husking-bee.  As  with 
all  weird  looking  birds  and  animals,  the  Crossbill  is  the 
subject  of  many  tales,  one  of  which  Longfellow  translated 
from  the  German  of  Julius  Mosen,  under  the  title  of  "  The 
Legend  of  the  Crossbill." 

Redpoll:   Acanthis  linaria. 

Redpoll  Linnet. 
Length:  5.50  inches. 
Male :  Head,  neck,  breast,  and  rump  washed  with  rich  crimson,  over 

a  ground  of  gray  and  brown.     Back,  wings,  and  tail  dusky  ; 

dusky  white  beneath.     Tail  short  and  forked  ;  wings  long  and 

pointed.    Bill  very  sharp,  and  either  yellow,  tipped  with  dusky, 

or  black  ;  feet  dark. 
Female :  Dingy,  having  the  crimson  only  on  the  crown. 
Song :  A  Canary-like  call  note  and  a  lisping  song ;  sometimes  given 

when  flocking  as  well  as  in  the  breeding-season.

SONG-BIRDS.  Redpoll 

Season :  A  winter  visitor  from  the  north. 

Breeds  :  In  boreal  regions. 

Range :  Northern  portions  of  Northern  Hemisphere  ;  south,  irregu- 
larly, in  winter  ;  in  North  America,  to  the  middle  United 
States  (Washington,  D.C.,  Kansas,  southeastern  Oregon). 

The  Redpoll,  Redpoll  Linnet,  or  Little  Snowbird,  as  it  is 
locally  called,  comes  out  of  the  north  on  the  snow  clouds, 
with  the  Buntings  and  Crossbills,  and  returns  to  its  breed- 
ing-grounds usually  before  its  spring  song  is  heard.  It  is 
most  frequently  to  be  seen  in  weedy  pastures,  where  it 
feeds  upon  the  seeds  of  small  herbs,  and  after  heavy  snows 
have  covered  the  lowlands  it  retreats  to  the  many-seeded 
compositae  that  swarm  along  the  sides  of  grass-grown  roads, 
and  in  an  extremity,  feeds  upon  tree  buds,  especially  those 
of  the  black  birch.  It  never  becomes  as  friendly  as  its 
cousin,  the  American  Goldfinch,  but  you  can  easily  identify 
it  and  watch  its  movements  when  it  is  feeding  upon  some 
conspicuous  spray  that  protrudes  from  the  fresh  snow.  At 
such  times  a  flock  of  Redpolls,  with  their  little  ruddy 
crowns,  are  the  prettiest  things  imaginable.  Thoreau's 
soliloquy  upon  these  winter  birds,  as  he  stood  looking  over 
the  late  November  landscape,  is  too  beautiful  to  quote  merely 
in  part.  He  says:  "Standing  there,  though  in  this  bare 
November  landscape,  I  am  reminded  of  the  incredible  phe- 
nomenon of  small  birds  in  winter,  that  erelong,  amid  the 
cold,  powdery  snow,  as  it  were  a  fruit  of  the  season,  will 
come  twittering  a  flock  of  delicate,  crimson-tinged  birds, 
Lesser  Redpolls,  to  sport  and  feed  on  the  seeds  and  buds 
just  ripe  for  them  on  the  sunny  side  of  a  wood,  shaking 
down  the  powdery  snow  there  in  their  cheerful  feeding,  as 
if  it  were  high  midsummer  to  them.  .  .  .  They  greet  the 
hunter  and  the  chopper  in  their  furs.  Their  Maker  gave 
them  the  last  touch,  and  launched  them  forth  the  day  of 
the  Great  Snow.  He  made  this  bitter,  imprisoning  cold, 
before  which  man  quails,  but  He  made  at  the  same  time 
these  warm  and  glowing  creatures  to  twitter  and  be  at 
home  in  it.  He  said  not  only  let  there  be  Linnets  in  win- 
ter,  but   Linnets   of   rich  plumage    and   pleasing  twitter,

Wild  Canary,  Thistle-bird,  Telloicbird. 
Plate  28.     Fig.  2. 

Length:  4.80-5.20  inches. 

Male :  Body,  all  but  wings,  tail,  and  frontlet,  a  clear  gamboge-yeUow. 
Frontlet  black.  Wings  black,  varied  with  white.  Tail  blackish 
with  spots  of  white  on  interior  of  quills.  Bill  and  feet  flesh- 
coloured.  In  September  the  black  frontlet  of  the  male  disap- 
pears, his  colours  pale,  and  he  resembles  the  female  and  young. 
In  April  the  spring  moult  begins,  and  often  is  not  completed 
until  middle  May. 

Female  :  Above  brownish  olive,  below  yellowish. 

Song:  A  wild,  sweet,  Canarj'-like  warbling.  Call  note,  "  Ker-chee- 
chee-chee,  whew-6,  whew-6  !  " 

Season :  Resident  in  this  section,  but  the  numbers  increase  in  May 
and  diminish  in  October. 

Breeds :  Southward  to  the  middle  districts  of  the  United  States  (to 
about  the  Potomac  and  Ohio  rivers,  Kansas,  and  California). 

Nest :  Round,  very  neat,  and  compact ;  of  grass  and  moss,  lined  with 
seed  and  plant  down,  usually  in  a  branch  crotch. 

Eggs:  4-6,  blue-white,  generally  unmarked. 

Bange:  North  America  generally,  wintering  mostly  south  of  the 
northern  boundary  of  the  United  States. 

The  American  Goldfinch,  known  under  many  titles,  is  as 
familiar  as  the  Ptobin,  Catbird,  and  Wren,  but  its  beauty 
and  winning  ways  always  seem  new  and  interesting.  In 
southern  Connecticut,  as  well  as  in  locations  further  north 
and  east,  it  is  resident,  and  is  revealed  through  its  various 
disguises  of  plumage  by  its  typical  dipping  flight. 

Its  spring  song  begins  early  in  April,  though  its  plumage 
does  not  resume  the  perfect  yellow  until  late  May ;  the  song 
remains  at  its  height  all  through  July  and  well  into  August, 
but  ceases,  almost  abruptly,  at  the  end  of  that  month  (from 
the  20,  to  the  30,  according  to  ]^Ir.  Bicknell). 

These  Goldfinches  do  not  mate  until  June,  and  sometimes 
not  until  the  last  half  of  the  month.     They  always  choose

for  their  nesting-place  some  large  maples  that  grow  by  the 
southwest  wall  of  the  garden,  extending  their  branches  over 
a  waste  field,  where  dandelions,  thistles,  wild  asters,  and 
goldenrod  hold  sway.  A  little  before  this  time  flocks  of 
birds  assemble  about  the  garden  and  every  Jack  chooses  his 
Jill,  or  vice  versa.  There  is  no  more  cheerful  and  confiding 
garden  companion  than  this  Goldfinch.  Seen  even  at  a  dis- 
tance his  markings  are  distinct,  his  identity  complete ;  you 
do  not  have  to  puzzle  or  worry,  but  simply  enjoy  his  society ; 
he  does  not  wish  your  berries,  but  helps  you  remove  the 
dandelion  down  from  the  lawn  before  the  wind  sows  it 
broadcast,  and  all  the  while  you  hear  Canary-like  music, 
but  wilder  and  more  joyous,  from  behind  a  twig  lattice 
instead  of  cage  bars. 

The  black  cap  gives  the  male  a  ferocious  look,  wholly 
at  variance  with  his  character,  while  his  mate  is  agreeably 
feminine  and  gentle.  These  birds  combine  the  rich  colours, 
which  we  associate  with  the  tropics,  and  the  stout-hearted, 
cold-enduring  New  England  nature,  softened  by  the  most 
agreeably  cosmopolitan  manners.  If  you  wish  them  to  live 
with  you  and  honour  your  trees  with  their  nests,  plant  sun- 
flowers in  your  garden,  zinnias,  and  coreopsis ;  leave  a  bit  of 
wild  grass  somewhere  about  with  its  mass  of  compositae. 
Coax  the  wild  clematis  everywhere  that  it  can  gain  footing ; 
and  in  winter,  when  these  joyous  birds,  gathered  in  flocks, 
are  roving,  hard-pressed  for  food,  scatter  some  sweepings  of 
bird  seed  about  their  haunts,  repaying  in  this  their  silent 
season,  their  summer  melody. 


Pine  Siskin :   Spinus  pinus. 


Length:  4.75  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Striped  generally;  above  olive-brown  and  gray, 

darkest  on  head  and  back.     Below  lighter,  sometimes  having  a 

decidedly  sulphur-yellow  tinge  on  rump  and  base  of  wing  and 

tail  feathers.     Bill  and  feet  brown. 
Song:  Resembling  that  of  the  American  Goldfinch,  but  in  a  more 

fretful  key,  and  seldom  heard  in  this  locality. 
141 


Snowflake  SONG-BIRDS. 

Season :  An  erratic  winter  visitor.  Late  October  to  March  and  early 
April. 

Breeds :  Mostly  north  of  the  United  States,  and  in  the  Rocky  Moun- 
tain region.  Casually  in  northern  New  England  and  New  York 
State. 

Nest :  Rare,  high  in  evergreens,  principally. 

Fggs :  Light  green,  spotted  with  brown. 

Bange :  North  America  generally,  in  winter  south  to  the  Gulf  States 
and  Mexico. 

The  Pine  Siskin,  as  its  name  implies,  is  a  lover  of  ever- 
greens, and  spends  the  winter  in  roving  from  copse  to  copse. 
It  is  strictly  a  seed-eater,  and  consumes  alike  the  kernels  of 
large  cones  and  the  seeds  of  low  herbs.  It  has  the  dipping 
flight  of  the  Goldfinch,  and  many  other  characteristics  of 
the  two  birds  are  similar.  You  will  be  most  likely  to  iden- 
tify the  Pine  Siskin  as  it  clings  to  tufts  of  spruce  cones, 
peering  between  their  scales;  the  sulphur-yellow  tinge  of 
the  feathers  showing  plainly  against  the  deep  green. 

Dr.  Jonathan  Dwight,  Jr.,  who  heard  these  Siskins  sing- 
ing between  March  15,  and  May  2,  at  Rockaway  and  Cypress 
Hills  Cemetery,  says  that  their  song  is  a  "soliloquizing 
gabble,  interspersed  with  a  prolonged  wheeze  —  a  pro- 
longation of  their  usual  note  while  flying.'^  Mr.  Bicknell 
adds :  "  This  hoarse  note  sometimes  sounds  like  a  common 
note  of  the  English  House  Sparrow.  Before  it  was  familiar 
to  me,  it  was  with  no  little  surprise  that  I  heard  at  Big 
Moose  Lake,  deep  in  the  Adirondack  wilderness,  a  bird  note 
so  suggestive  of  city  streets." 

Snowflake:  JPlectrophanes  nivalis. 

Snow  Bunting. 

Plxte  28.    Fig.  1. 
Length :  7  inches. 

Male  and  Female:   Summer  plumage  white,  with  the  exception  of 
black  hack,  white-banded  wings,  tail,  and  band  across  back. 
Winter  plumage  soft  browns  and  white,  —  dead-leaf  colours  and 
snow.    Bill  and  feet  black. 
Song:  Thoreau  says,  "a  soft,  rippling  note." 
Season :  A  midwinter  visitor,  especially  in  snowy  seasons.

SONG-BIRDS.  Snowflake 

Breeds :  In  the  Arctic  regions. 

Nest :  Thickly  lined  with  feathers  set  in  a  tussock. 

Eggs :  4-6,  variable  in  size  and  colour,  whitish  speckled  with  neutral 
tints. 

Bange:  Northern  parts  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  In  North 
America,  south  in  winter  into  the  northern  United  States,  irreg- 
ularly to  Georgia,  southern  Illinois,  and  Kansas. 

A  bird  well  named,  for  the  Snowflake,  hurried  from  the 
north  by  fierce  winds  and  weather,  comes  to  us  out  of  the 
snow-clouds.  Travelling  in  great  flocks,  which  are  de- 
scribed as  numbering  sometimes  a  thousand,  they  settle 
down  upon  the  old  fields  and  upland  meadows,  subsisting 
upon  various  seeds.  Their  winter  plumage,  by  which  we 
alone  know  them,  is  exquisitely  soft  and  beautiful,  and  the 
birds  themselves  have  a  wonderfully  mild  and  spiritual 
expression  as  if  they  had  come  from  an  unknown  region, 
and  craved  a  little  food  and  shelter,  but  conscious  that  while 
here  they  are  the  veriest  birds  of  passage. 

Though  a  native  of  Arctic  latitudes,  Snowflakes,  belated 
on  their  return  migration,  have  been  knowm  to  breed  in  the 
Northern  States.  In  July,  1831,  Audubon  found  a  couple 
nesting  in  the  White  Mountains,  and  Dr.  J.  A.  Allen  notes 
a  pair  as  breeding  near  Springfield,  Mass.  In  its  home  it  is 
said  to  have  a  cheerful  inspiriting  song,  but  here  we  only 
know  its  Sparrow-like  call  note. 

The  Snowflake  is  very  capricious  in  its  visits,  as  are,  in 
fact,  all  the  winter  birds  along  the  Connecticut  shore  of  the 
Sound.  An  easterly  wind  prevailing  for  several  days  drives 
them  two  or  three  miles  inland  behind  the  Greenfield  ridge 
of  hills.  During  the  snowy  winter  of  1893-94  not  a  single 
flock  appeared,  though  the  weather  was  evenly  cold  and 
marked  by  northeasterly  storms.  On  February  15,  1894, 
—  one  of  the  only  days  of  the  season  when  there  was  suffi- 
cient snow  for  sleighing,  a  day  with  heavy,  drifting  clouds 
and  wind  gusts  which  scattered  the  loose  snow  so  suddenly 
that  it  was  driven  with  the  sharpness  of  sand,  —  I  drove  for 
several  miles  along  the  road  that  separates  the  shore  and 
marshes  from  cultivation,  and  was  rewarded  by  seeing  GullS;

Longspur  SONG-BIRDS. 

Meadowlarks,  Horned  Larks,  Eedpolls,  Snowflakes,  and, 
rarest  of  all,  Lapland  Longspurs,  the  first  time  that  I  had 
identified  them  here. 

The  Eedpolls  and  Snowflakes  were  feeding  under  similar 
conditions,  —  the  Eedpolls  keeping  under  cover  of  bushes  and 
furrows,  while  the  Snowflakes  were  in  the  open,  and  the 
flock  continually  arose  with  the  drifting  snow  and  settled 
again  like  a  part  of  it,  uttering  a  soft  chirp  as  they  shifted. 

Lapland  Longspur:   Calcarius  lapponicus 

Length:  6.50  inches. 

Male :  Winter  plumage,  top  of  head  black,  edged  with  rusty,  black 
above,  the  feathers  all  tipped  with  white.  A  rusty  black  patch 
behind  and  beneath  the  eye.  Below  grayish,  with  faint  black 
markings.  Bill  yellow,  tipped  with  black ;  feet  and  legs  black. 
Long  hind  claw  or  spur. 

Female :  Rusty  gray  above,  whitish  below. 

Song :  A  charming  song  in  the  breeding-season,  uttered  while  soaring 
like  the  Skylark's. 

Season:  A  winter  visitor;  rare  locally,  but  common  on  the  Massa- 
chusetts coast  and  also  noted  by  Mr.  Averill  as  associating  with 
Shore  Larks  near  Stratford,  Conn. 

Breeds :  In  the  Arctic  regions,  where  it  has  a  thick,  fur-lined,  grass 
nest,  set  in  moss  on  the  ground. 

Mange:  Northern  portions  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere;  in  North 
America,  south,  in  winter,  into  the  northern  United  States, 
irregularly  to  the  Middle  States,  accidentally  to  South  Carolina, 
and  abundantly  in  the  interior  to  Kansas  and  Colorado. 

When  we  are  fortunate  enough  to  see  the  Longspur,  he  is 
wearing  his  winter  dress,  which  resembles  somewhat  the 
plumage  of  the  Titlark. 

I  always  considered  them  rare  birds  hereabout,  until 
I  found  them  near  the  shore  last  February.  I  was  first 
attracted  by  unusual  claw  marks  in  the  new  snow,  where  it 
was  soft  enough  to  take  distinct  impressions,  under  the 
south  side  of  a  rick  of  salt  hay.  The  Longspur  is  a  ground 
feeder  like  the  Larks  and  Buntings,  and  the  mark  of  the 
long  hind  claw,  or  spur  could  be  seen  plainly;  on  the 
opposite  side  of  the  rick  were  the  birds  themselves,  seven

in  all.  They  were  climbing  up  the  sloping  sides,  picking 
seeds  from  the  coarse  grasses  and  weeds  which  served  as 
covering  for  the  finer  hay.  The  Longspurs,  as  well  as  the 
Horned  Larks  that  were  with  them,  were  so  hungry  and 
intent  upon  feeding  that  they  were  not  in  the  least  dis- 
turbed, even  though  they  must  have  seen  me  plainly.  This 
lack  of  fear  produced  by  hunger  often  gives  the  winter 
birds  an  air  of  charming  familiarity,  and,  though  both  win- 
ter residents  and  visitors  are  comparatively  few,  a  little  food, 
suited  to  their  various  needs,  wisely  scattered  about  the  door 
and  around  the  hayricks  and  sheds,  will  bring  you  a  troop 
of  grateful  guests  to  whisper  cheerfully,  even  if  they  do  not 
sing  to  you. 

Vesper  Sparrow:  Pooccetes  gramineus* 

Bay-winged  Bunting. 
Plate  29.     Fig.  1. 

Length :  5.75-6.25  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  brown,  varied  with  dusky.  Lesser  wing 
coverts  bright  bay.  Below  soiled  white,  striped  everywhere 
except  on  the  belly  with  brown.  iVo  yellow  anywhere.  Outer 
tail  feathers  partly  white,  appearing  conspicuously  like  two 
white  quills  when  the  bird  flies.  Upper  mandible  brown ;  lower 
and  feet  yellowish  flesh-coloured. 

Song :  Sweet  and  clear,  less  loud  than  the  Song  Sparrow's,  —  "  Chewee- 
chewee-cheewee,  tira-lira-lira-lee ! " 

Season :  Common  summer  resident ;  April  to  October. 

Breeds :  From  Virginia,  Kentucky,  and  Missouri  northward. 

Nest :  Sunk  to  the  rim  in  the  grass  or  ground,  quite  deep ;  of  grasses; 
as  carefully  made  as  if  it  were  a  tree  nest. 

Eggs:  4-6,  thickly  mottled  and  spotted  with  brown. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains ;  from  Nova  Scotia  and 
Ontario  southward. 

This  is  the  Sparrow  which  is  identified  by  the  red-brown 
shoulders  and  the  two  white  tail  quills,  and  who,  though 
living  near  the  ground,  often  soars  singing  into  the  air.  Its 
song,  though  less  constantly  heard,  is  as  familiar  as  the 
Song  Sparrow's,  and  its  habit  of  singing  from  late  afternoon 
until  twilight  has  given  it  the  name  of  Vesper  Sparrow.  ^

Sparrows  SONG-BIRDS. 

In  the  garden,  from  the  nook  looking  toward  sunset,  I  am 
always  certain  to  hear  a  half  dozen  of  these  little  soloists, 
continuing  their  music  after  the  evening  chorus  has  ceased, 
until  finally,  with  the  Veery  and  Eose-breasted  Grosbeak, 
they  form  a  final  trio  which  precedes  such  silence  as  Nature 
allows  to  the  early  summer  nights. 

The  Vesper  Sparrows  are,  in  the  main,  seed-eaters,  but 
during  the  summer  they  also  feed  upon  insects,  earthworms, 
and  berries.  They  are  birds  of  the  roadside  and  of  waste 
fields,  where  they  are  abundant  in  early  autumn,  fluttering 
about  in  flocks,  now  perching  on  a  fence  rail,  and  as  you 
approach  them,  scattering  widely,  only  to  collect  again  a 
few  feet  further  on.  They  are  dingy-looking  birds  in  the 
distance,  but  the  white  tail  quills  will  always  name  them. 

Ipswich  Sparrow :  Aminodramus  princeps. 

Length :  6.25  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  grayish,  with  a  reddish  cast  to  back ;  dusky 
streaks  on  top  of  head,  separated  by  a  broad  stripe  of  pale 
yellowish  white.  Below  pure  white,  sides  of  throat  and  broad 
band  across  breast  and  sides,  streaked  with  red-brown ;  bill  and 
feet  brown. 

Song :  Poor  and  halting,  as  if  the  voice  weak  and  tired. 

Season :  A  rare  winter  resident. 

Breeds :  In  the  grass-covered  sand-hills  of  Sable  Island,  Nova  Scotia. 

Nest :  A  few  strands  of  grass  in  a  hollow  of  the  ground. 

Eggs :  Harlequin,  pale  green  groundwork,  jumbled  with  blotches  of 
brown  of  every  shape  and  tint. 

Bange :  Nova  Scotia,  south ;  in  winter,  to  South  Carolina. 

The  Ipswich  Sparrow  is  a  puzzling  bird  to  identify.  It 
was  discovered  by  Mr.  Maynard  among  the  Ipswich  sand- 
hills —  hence  its  name.  Its  plumage  is  difficult  to  describe 
tersely ;  perhaps  it  is  best  to  say  that  it  resembles  the  Ves- 
per Sparrow,  but  has  a  yellowish  head  stripe  and  two  dull 
white  wing  bars.  Here  it  is  seen  either  as  a  winter  resi- 
dent or  a  migrant,  and  is  decidedly  a  local  species.  It  is  a 
very  hardy  Sparrow ;  Mr.  Torrey  has  found  it  near  Nahant, 
Mass.,  in  every  one  of  the  colder  months  from  October  to 
April.

SONG-BIRDS.  Sparrows 

Sayanna  Sparrow:  Am^nodratnus  sandwichensis 
savanna* 

Length :  5.60-6  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above,  back,  wings,  throat,  and  sides  striped  in 

various  shades  of  brown  and  bronze.      Yellowish  stripe  on 

crown  and  over  eye,  and  yellowish  wash  around  neck.    Cheeks 

golden  bronze.    Below  whitish.    Bill  dark  above,  light  below  ; 

feet  light  flesh-coloured. 
Song:  Described  by  Samuels  as  sweet  and  soft.     "  Chewee-chewitt- 

chewitt-chewitt-chewe-et-chewee  ! " 
Season :  A  common  resident,  on  the  salt-marshes  all  the  year,  whose 

migrating  flocks  arrive  in  April  and  leave  in  October. 
Breeds:  From  New  England  to  Labrador  and  the  Hudson's  Bay 

Territory. 
Nest :  A  slight  affair,  sunken  in  the  ground  like  the  last  species. 
Eggs :  Also  motley,  like  the  last. 
Bange  :  Eastern  North  America. 

The  Savanna  Sparrow  is  a  common  resident,  being  found 
in  the  thickets  bordering  the  salt-marshes  as  well  as  in 
the  marshes  themselves,  where  numbers  remain  even  in 
severe  weather,  and,  while  it  is  abundant  along  the  coast, 
it  is  proportionately  rare  in  the  interior.  It  is  essentially 
a  ground  Sparrow  (which  is  one  of  its  local  names) ;  for,  in 
addition  to  building  on  the  ground,  it  limits  its  flight  to 
low  bushes.  Its  plumage  is  so  streaked  and  mixed  that 
it  blends  with  the  earth,  —  a  great  protection  to  the  bird, 
but  a  condition  which  makes  identification  difficult.  Keep 
in  mind  that  its  under  parts  are  ivhiter  than  in  other  Sparrows. 

1  associate  this  Sparrow  with  early  June  walks  through 
the  marshes  and  upland  meadows,  when  the  wild  flowers 
are  calling  "  Come  pick  us  '^ ;  when  the  beach  plum's  white 
plumes  are  fading  with  the  iris,  and  the  star-grass  and  yel- 
low thistles  are  in  bloom,  and  the  tall  blackberry  bushes 
trace  the  tumble-down  fences  with  their  wands.  Then  you 
may  see  the  Savanna  Sparrow  hurrying  through  the  sand- 
grass,  seeking  the  cover  of  bayberries,  only  to  slip  through 
and  disappear.  He  will  not  indicate  by  the  slightest  hint 
which  little  circle  of  grass  margins  his  home,  barely  sepa- 
rating the  young  from  the  earth  itself.     He  will  lead  you 

147 


Sparrows  SONG-BIRDS. 

as  far  away  from  it  as  he  is  able,  and,  if  it  is  late  afternoon, 
will  beguile  you  with  his  simple  song,  from  no  more  ambi- 
tious perch  than  a  fence  rail.  The  migrant  flocks  come  to 
us  before  or  during  the  spring  moult,  and  are  not  then  in 
full  song ;  and  when  they  leave,  in  October,  they  are  quite 
voiceless. 

Grasshopper  Sparrow:  Ammodramus  savannarum 
passerinus. 

Yellow-winged  Sparrow. 


Length :  4.80  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Line  over  the  eye,  centre  of  crown,  lesser  wing 
coverts,  and  shoulders  yellow.  Above  red-brown  with  an  ash- 
gray  wash  ;  upper  breast  brownish  drab  ;  belly  whitish ;  bill 
stout  and  short,  dark  above,  pale  below ;  tail  feathers  edged 
with  white  ;  feet  dark. 

Song :  Note  like  a  grasshopper's  chirp  ;  song  somewhat  resembling 
the  Chipping  Sparrow's,  but  in  a  different  key. 

Season :  Common  summer  resident. 

Breeds :  Throughout  its  United  States  range. 

Nest :  Like  the  Vesper  Sparrow's,  on  the  ground. 

Eggs :  Sparkling  white,  with  spots  and  flecks  of  red  and  brown. 

Bange:  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada  to  the  Plains, 
south  to  Florida,  Cuba,  Porto  Rico,  and  coast  of  Central 
America. 

If  you  search  for  a  Sparrow  with  yellow  wings,  as  one  of 
its  names  suggests,  you  will  altogether  miss  this  species. 
But  if  you  look  for  a  plain  bird,  with  yellowish  stripes 
on  the  crown  and  over  the  eyes,  lesser  wing  coverts  dull 
yellow,  and  bend  of  the  wing  bright  yellow,  who  runs  elu- 
sively  through  the  grass,  giving  a  shrill,  grasshopper  chirp, 
you  will  easily  locate  the  Grasshopper  Sparrow.  The  Spar- 
rows and  the  Warblers  will  be  inevitable  stumbling-blocks 
to  you ;  and  when  you  have  positively  named  half  a  dozen 
species,  and  guessed  at  as  many  more,  you  will  feel  that 
you  have  conquered  ornithology.  This  particular  Sparrow 
keeps  so  persistently  to  the  ground  and  to  low  bushes,  in.

addition  having  but  the  ghost  of  a  voice,  that  it  will  not  be 
strange  if  you  overlook  it. 

Sharp-tailed  Sparrow:  Ammodramus  caudacutus* 

Length :  5-5.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Bill  extremely  sharp  for  a  Sparrow.  Above  olive- 
gray  v^ith  bronze  glints,  streaked  writh  black  on  the  back,  some 
feathers  with  light  edges  ;  marroon  stripes  on  head  ;  buff  stripe 
through  eye ;  buff  or  orange  cheeks ;  buff  sides  to  breast,  streaked 
with  brown ;  belly  gray ;  edge  of  wings  yellow  ;  tail  feathers 
sharply  pointed  ;  feet  grayish  blue. 

Song :  Wheezy  and  choking,  which  Dr.  D wight  describes  as  *♦  Lic-se- 
e-e-oop." 

Season :  Common  summer  resident. 

Breeds :  Through  its  range ;  two  broods  a  season. 

Nest :  Of  coarse  grasses,  lined  with  grass  and  furze,  firmly  fastened 
between  tussocks. 

Eggs :  Grayish  white,  thickly  speckled  with  brown. 

Bange:  Salt-marshes  of  the  Atlantic  coast,  from  Prince  Edward 
Island  and  Nova  Scotia  to  the  Gulf  States. 

The  Sharp-tailed  Sparrow  must  be  identified  by  the  brown- 
ish orange  or  buff  colouring  of  the  sides  of  its  head  and  the 
sharp  point  which  terminates  each  separate  tail  feather.  I 
specify  this  because  many  people  mistake  the  term  sharp- 
tailed  for  forked-t2iiied,  and  expect  the  bird  to  have  a  tail 
like  the  Barn  Swallow. 

These  Sparrows  are  shy  and  rather  uninteresting,  keeping 
close  under  cover  of  sedges  and  the  marsh  weeds  that  edge 
tide  water,  and  have  a  feeble  flight  and  a  very  poor  song. 
They  tend  to  breed  in  colonies,  and  choose  their  haunts  here 
and  there  without  any  seeming  method,  so  that  they  appear 
to  be  rare  in  many  eligible  places. 

Wilson  credits  them  with  all  the  nimbleness  of  Sand- 
pipers, running  about  after  dusk  and  roosting  on  the 
ground ;  and  says  that  they  are  so  fond  of  the  vicinity  of 
water  that  they  are  only  driven  from  it  by  strong  north- 
easterly storms.  He  also  says  that  their  diet  is  chiefly  sea- 
food, scraps  of  shell-fish,  drift,  etc.,  which  gives  the  flesh  a 
sedgy  taste.

Sparrowa  SONG-BIRDS. 

Seaside   Sparrow ;    A^ninodramus  ntaritimus* 

Length :  5.75-6.25  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Very  dull  brownish  gray  bird.  Gray  wash  on 
shoulders  and  the  edges  of  some  feathers.  Breast  mottled 
gray  with  buff  tinge.  Throat  yellow-white.  Wings  and  tail 
dusky.  Yellow  spot  before  eye  and  yellow  mark  on  edge  of 
wing,  the  only  bright  colouring.     Bill  lead-coloured  ;  dark  feet. 

Song:  Very  similar  to  that  of  the  last  species. 

Season:  Common  summer  resident,  breeding  on  salt-marshes. 
Present  December  9,  1889.  Probably  sometimes  winters. 
(Averill.) 

Breeds :  Through  range. 

Kest  and  Eggs :  Indistinguishable  from  last  species. 

Mange :  Salt-marshes  of  the  Atlantic  coast,  from  Massachusetts  south- 
ward, and  along  the  Gulf  coast  to  the  Rio  Grande. 

One  of  our  two  common  Sparrows  that  have  a  maritime 
turn  of  mind,  breeding  freely  about  Fairfield  and  Stratford 
on  the  marshes.  The  two  species  are  so  closely  associated 
that  it  is  easy  to  confuse  them ;  the  Seaside  Sparrow  has  the 
least  definite  colouring,  no  distinct  black  stripes  on  the  back, 
and  a  blunt  tail. 

White-crowned  Sparrow:  Zonotrichia  leucophrys. 

Length :  6.50-7  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  White  crown  set  between  two  black  stripes ;  white 
eye  stripes.  Cheeks,  throat,  and  back  of  neck  gray.  Below 
light  gray  ;  some  buff  on  sides  and  belly.  Wings  edged  with 
bay,  and  having  two  white  cross-bars ;  tail  plain.  Female,  head 
rusty,  paler  all  through.    Bill  and  feet  reddish  brown. 

So7ig  .•  6  or  7  notes,  forming  a  plaintive  cadence. 

Season :  Rare  migrant ;  October  and  May. 

Breeds:  Chiefly  in  the  Rocky  Mountain  region  (including  Sierra 
Nevada) ,  and  northeast  to  Labrador. 

Nest  and  Eggs:  Not  to  be  distinguished  from  those  of  the  White- 
throated  Sparrow. 

Range :  North  America  at  large. 

One  of  the  largest  Sparrows,  and  also  conspicuously 
marked,  the  White-crown  is  scarcely  the  inferior  of  the 
White-throat  itself.     It  has   a  northerly  range,   and   only

comes  to  us  as  a  very  restless  migrant  in  middle  autumn  and 
late  spring,  when  it  is  occasionally  seen  feeding  with.  Jun- 
cos  and  White-throats. 

White-throated  Sparrow:  Zonotrichia  albicollis* 

Plate  26.     Fig.  2. 
Length:  6.50-7  inches. 
Male  and  Female :  A  plump,  handsome  bird.     White  throat  and  crown 

stripes.    Back  striped  with  black,  bay,  and  whitish.    Rump  light 

olive-brown.     Bay  edgings  to  wings,  and  two  white  cross-bars  ; 

under  parts  gray.      Yellow  spot  before  eye.     Female  crown, 

brown,  markings  less  distinct. 
Song:  Sweet  and  plaintive,  —  " Pee-a-peabody,  peabody,  peabody  !" 
Season  :  Abundant  migrant ;  also  a  winter  resident  from  September 

to  May. 
Breeds :  From  New  England  and  the  Northern  States  northward. 
Nest :  A  deep  grass  nest  partly  sunken  in  the  ground  or  in  a  low  bush. 
Eggs :  Variable,  greenish,  and  thinly  speckled  with  reddish  brown  to 

gray,  blotched  heavily  with  chocolate. 
Bange :  Eastern  North  America  west  to  the  Plains,  north  to  Labrador 

and  the  Fur  Countries,  and  winters  from  the  Middle  States 

southward. 

This  is  unquestionably  the  most  beautiful  of  all  the  Spar- 
rows, not  excepting  the  great  Fox  Sparrow,  and  its  rich 
velvety  markings  and  sweet  voice  have  made  it  one  of  the 
welcome  migrants,  and  the  few  that  remain  through  the 
winter  are  carefully  fed  and  cherished. 

The  past  season  (1894)  the  upward  migration  began  early 
in  March,  the  7,  being  the  first  day  that  I  noticed  a  de- 
cided movement,  and  then  no  more  large  flocks  appeared 
until  the  first  week  of  May.  A  flock  settled  on  a  bit  of  ground 
newly  sown  with  grass  seed,  and  devoted  themselves  to  it 
with  such  zest  that  at  the  end  of  three  days  every  seed  had 
found  its  way  into  their  little  stomachs ;  however,  as  the 
ground  was  near  the  piazza  it  gave  me  a  fine  opportunity  to 
watch  them,  and  four  quarts  of  grass  seed  was  a  small  price 
to  pay  for  their  society. 

The  White-throat's  song  has  been  expressed  in  many  dif-

body,  peabody";  words  from  which  it  received  the  name 
of  Peabody  Bird. 

Wilson  Flagg  says  that  the  Maine  folk  interpret  the 
notes  as,  "All-day,  whittling,  whittling,  whittling."  And 
then  there  is  the  evidence  of  Farmer  Peverly,  whom  Ham- 
ilton Gibson  interviewed,  who,  upon  being  perplexed  and 
undecided  as  to  the  crop  that  he  ought  to  sow  in  a  particular 
field,  understood  the  Sparrow  to  say,  "  Sow  wheat,  Peverly, 
Peverly." 

You  may  take  your  choice  as  to  the  words,  but  pray  notice 
that  all  these  interpretations  have  the  same  accented  value, 
and  so  equally  imitate  the  song.  This  Sparrow  also  some- 
times sings  softly  in  the  night,  — 

"*        *        *        * 
Nestling  in  his  tree 
The  sleeping  Sparrow 
Dreams  a  melody." 

Tree  Sparrow :    Spizella  tnonticola* 

Winter  Chip-bird. 

Length :  5.76-6.25  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Bright  bay  crown.  Gray  stripe  over  eye,  cheeks, 
throat,  and  breast.  Dark  brown  back  with  feathers  pheasant- 
like, edged  with  orange  and  brown.  Wings  dark  brown  with 
paler  edgings  and  two  white  bars.  Bill  black  above,  lower 
mandible  yellowish,  feet  brownish  black. 

Song :  In  winter  a  twittering  trill. 

Season :  Winter  resident ;  October  to  April. 

Breeds :  North  of  the  United  States,  east  of  the  Rocky  Mountains. 

Nest :  Of  grass,  bark,  and  feathers ;  on  ground,  in  a  bush,  or  occa- 
sionally in  a  tree. 

Eggs ;  4-7,  light  green,  finely  sprinkled  with  reddish  brown. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America  westward  to  the  Plains,  and  from  the

Like  the  Junco,  the  Tree  Sparrow  is  a  winter  resident, 
though  not  so  constant  and  abundant  as  the  former.  It  is 
much  larger  than  the  Chipping  Sparrow,  which  it  so  closely

resembles  as  to  be  called  the  Winter  Chip-bird,  coming  at  a 
season  when  the  sociable  Chippy  has  gone  south.  Why  it 
is  called  Tree  Sparrow  is  not  so  plain,  as  it  does  not  build 
in  trees  as  frequently  as  the  Chippy,  and  it  haunts  low 
bushes.  I  have  seen  these  Sparrows  in  December,  feeding 
in  flocks  on  the  ground,  in  company  with  Snowbirds  and 
a  few  stray  White-throats;  dashing  about  and  sometimes 
singing  in  a  sort  of  undertone,  perfectly  careless  of  cold. 
Burroughs  calls  the  song  "a  soft,  sweet  note,  almost  run- 
ning into  a  warble." 

They  are  very  hardy  birds,  and  to  them,  as  with  all  winter 
birds,  mere  cold  is  secondary  in  comparison  with  cutting 
winds.  I  have  often  seen  them  huddled  under  stone  walls, 
and  once  found  a  flock  feeding  in  the  bottom  of  a  dry  ditch ; 
and  in  ploughed  fields  you  will  notice  that  they  keep  closely 
to  the  furrows  in  windy  weather.  At  night  they  troop  into 
the  evergreen  hedge,  the  piazza  vines,  and  under  the  rick 
edges,  —  anywhere  that  the  wind  may  not  pierce,  for  that, 
together  with  scanty  food,  reduces  their  vitality. 

Chipping  Sparrow:    Spizella  socialis. 

Hair-bird,  Chippy. 

Plate  30.     Fig.  2. 
Length:  6-6.26  inches. 
Male  and  Female :  Dark  chestnut  poll,  gray  stripe  over  eye,  brown 

stripe  tlirough  it.     Stripes  along  back,  dark  orange  and  brown. 

Wings  and  tail  dust-brown.    Under  parts  light  gray.    Young 

with  some  black  streaks  on  crown.     Bill  black ;  feet  light. 
Song :  An  insect-like  tremolo,  varying  a  little  in  tone  from  a  locust. 

Call  note,  "  Chip-chip  !  " 
Season  :  Common  summer  resident ;  April  to  October. 
Breeds :  In  the  greater  part  of  its  range. 
Nest :  In  bushes  and  also  high  trees,  made  of  fine  grasses  and  lined 

with  horsehair  —  hence  the  name.  Hair-bird. 
Eggs :  4,  greenish  blue,  with  dark  brown  speckles. 
Bange :  Eastern  North  America,  west  to  the  Rocky  Mountains,  north 

to  Great  Slave  Lake,  and  south  to  eastern  Mexico. 

This  is  the  precentor  who,  in  early  May  dawns,  gives  the

foiir  o'clock  the  most  melodious  hour  of  the  day.  T-r-r-r-r-r- 
r-r-r-r-r-r-r  he  trills  from  the  ground,  before  even  a  Robin 
wakes,  and  then,  as  the  music  swells,  he  is  lost  in  the  har- 
mony. 

AVho  can  fail  to  know  the  Chippy,  whose  mite  of  a  gray- 
brown  body  is  set  off  by  a  chestnut-coloured  velvet  cap, 
whose  chirp,  as  he  hops  about  the  door  craving  crumbs,  is  as 
familiar  as  his  pretty  air  of  sociability.  He  has  many  little 
points  of  identity  that  separate  him  from  the  mazes  of  the 
Sparrow  tribe.  He  seldom,  if  ever,  nests  upon  the  ground, 
and  his  nest,  well  built  and  carefully  lined,  is  distinctive. 
Here  in  the  garden  he  shows  a  preference  for  high  trees ; 
out  of  eight  nests  built  last  season  within  the  garden  limits, 
one  was  in  a  Deutzia  shrub  about  three  feet  from  the 
ground;  four  were  in  tufts  of  needles  on  the  horizontal 
boughs  of  spruces,  varying  from  eight  to  twenty  feet  high ; 
and  three  were  in  white  pines  at  distances  of  from  twenty  to 
forty  feet  from  the  ground. 

I  am  inclined  to  think  that  the  nesting-habits  of  birds  are 
adapted  by  circumstances  and  their  desire  to  locate  in  certain 
places.  The  Chippies  like  the  protection  and  society  of  the 
house  and  build  near  it.  Low  bushes  and  undergrowth  in 
this  vicinity  are  limited,  and  the  Catbirds  usurp  the  most 
desirable  shrubs.  Not  finding  room  below  the  Chippy 
ascends,  as  his  fellow-men  adaDt  themselves  to  the  apart- 
ment house,  so  that  from  being  ground-walkers  they  become 
"cliff-dwellers." 

Field  Sparrow :    Spizella  pusilla. 


Length :  5.25-5.75  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Pale  red  heak.  Bright  bay  on  the  back  between 
wings.  Crown  dull  chestnut,  no  black  or  white.  Whitish  wing 
bars,  tail  longer  than  wings,  below  grayish  white ;  very  light- 
coloured  feet. 

Song:  Very  pleasing  and  melodious,  "  Whee-whee-whee-iddle,  iddle, 
iddle,  ee  ! " 

Season :  Common  summer  resident. 

Breeds :  From  Virginia  northward.

SONG-BIRDS.  Junco 

Nest :  Of  grass,  in  low  shrubs  or  on  ground. 
Eggs :  4,  cloudy  white,  spotted  and  specked  with  brown. 
Bange:   Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada,  west  to  the 
Plains. 

TMs  is  the  tuneful  Sparrow  of  fields  and  meadows  that, 
rising  as  you  approach,  goes  with  a  wavering  flight  to  the 
next  rift  of  grasses,  never  letting  you  come  near  it,  and  yet 
not  appearing  to  be  shy.  At  first  you  will  think  it  a  Chippy, 
but  a  glance  with  your  field-glass  will  show  you  its  reddish 
bill,  longer  tail,  and  red-brown  upper  back,  and  while  you 
are  considering  these  differences  it  will  perhaps  perch  on  a 
branch  and  sing  (it  seldom  sings  while  flying),  and  then  you 
will  have  been  formally  introduced  to  the  Field  Sparrow. 

The  three  whistles  which  begin  the  song  are  very  soft  and 
sweet,  having  nothing  sibilant  about  them,  and  the  final  trill 
dies  away  gradually,  as  if  the  bird  was  moving  away  as  he 
sang.  The  quality  of  song  resembles  the  Vesper  Sparrow's, 
but  has  less  variety.  I  have  seen  Field  Sparrows  here  as 
late  as  Thanksgiving,  but  the  records  go  to  prove  that  the 
general  range  is  more  southerly  than  the  Chippy's,  and  that 
it  cannot  be  called  common  north  of  Massachusetts. 

Slate-coloured  Junco :  Junco  hyemalis, 

JSnoicbird. 

Plate  29.     Fig.  2. 

Length :  6-6.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Dark  bluish  slate  all  over,  except  lower  breast  and 
belly,  which  are  grayish  white  and  form  a  vest.  Several  outer 
tail  feathers  white,  conspicuous  in  flying.  Female,  with  a  more 
rusty  cast  and  vest  less  distinct.    Bill  flesh-white,  dusky  at  tip. 

Song :  A  crisp  call  note,  a  simple  trill,  and  a  faint  whispering  warble, 
usually  much  broken,  but  not  without  sweetness.  (Bicknell.) 
Song  sometimes  heard  before  it  leaves  in  spring. 

Season :  Common  winter  resident ;  late  September  to  April. 

Breeds :  From  the  higher  parts  of  the  Alleghanies  and  northern  New 
York  and  northern  New  England,  northward. 

Nest :  On  ground,  Sparrow-like. 

Eggs:  4-6,  white,  peppered  with  reddish  brown. 

Bange :  North  America  at  large,  but  chiefly  east  of  the  Rocky  Moun- 
tains ;  south  in  winter  to  the  Gulf  States.

Song  Sparrow  SONG-BIRDS. 

The  Juncos,  whose  habits  are  Sparrow-like,  come  to  us 
after  the  summer  moulting,  varying  their  return  with  the 
weather.  In  1893,  they  appeared  September  25,  but  they 
may  be  expected  to  increase  in  number  from  this  date  until 
late  October,  while  in  November  they  go  off  on  excursions 
in  little  parties,  a  habit  that  they  keep  up  all  winter. 

You  cannot  fail  to  name  the  Junco,  with  his  sad-coloured 
coat,  light  vest  and  tail  feathers;  his  cheerful  habits  will 
allow  you  to  become  quite  intimate  with  him  before  winter 
is  over,  for  he  will  come  freely  to  the  door  for  food,  and 
is  a  frequenter  of  city  parks  and  even  back  yards. 

Juncos  are  winter  residents  upon  whom  we  can  always 
depend,  although  the  numbers  vary  greatly.  A  small  flock 
has  lodged  for  many  seasons  in  the  evergreen  honeysuckles 
about  the  house,  and  one  bitterly  cold  February,  when 
every  seed  was  frozen  down,  a  number  came  into  the  barn, 
feeble  and  exhausted,  and  pecked  about  the  grain  bin, 
mutely  waiting  for  food ;  nor  were  they  disappointed. 

Together  with  the  Chickadee  they  are  frequently  to  be 
seen  around  the  kennels,  where  the  dogs  always  treat  them 
with  courtesy.  They  usually  leave  in  early  April,  but  some- 
times lingering  into  May,  they  let  us  hear  their  song  before 
they  go  northward  for  their  wooing. 

Song  Sparrow :    Melospiza  fasciata, 

Plate  30.     Fig.  1. 

Length:  6-6.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Brown  poll,  somewhat  striped.  Above  gray  and 
brown,  thickly  striped.  Gray  stripe  over  eye  ;  brown  stripe  each 
side  of  throat;  dark  stripes  across  upper  breast,  forming  a 
black  spot  in  front.  Beneath  gray,  slightly  striped.  Bill  dark 
brown  ;  feet  pale  brown. 

JSong :  "Olit,  olit,  olit,  —  chip,  chip,  chip,  che-char,  —  che-wiss,  wiss, 
wiss!"  (Thoreau,  "  Walden.")  "  Maids,  maids,  maids,  hang 
on  your  teakettle-ettle-ettle  ! "  (A  local  interpretation.  Tho- 
reau,  "Summer.") 

Season :  March  until  November.   Individuals  remain  through  the  year. 

Breeds :  From  Virginia  and  the  northern  portion  of  the  Lake  States 
northward.    Sometimes  three  broods  are  reared.

SONG-BIRDS.  Song  Sparrow 

Kest :  Location  variable  ;  on  ground  or  in  low  bush. 

Eggs :  Grayish  white,  spotted,  marked,  and  clouded  with  browns  and 

lavender. 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains. 

The  Song  Sparrow  is  the  darling  among  the  Song-birds ; 
the  Goldfinch's  gay  coat,  the  Bluebird's  confidential  mur- 
mur, or  the  melody  of  the  Thrushes  cannot  rival  him  in  our 
affections,  even  though  they  may  possess  superior  qualities. 
Plain  as  his  coat  is,  he  carries  his  identity  in  the  little 
black  streaks  that  form  two  spots  on  his  breast,  and  all  the 
year  we  may  hope  to  hear  his  simple  domestic  ballad. 
Thoreau  says :  "  Some  birds  are  poets  and  sing  all  summer. 
They  are  the  true  singers.  Any  man  can  write  verses  in 
the  love  season.  We  are  most  interested  in  those  birds  that 
sing  for  the  love  of  the  music,  and  not  of  their  mates ;  who 
meditate  their  strains  and  amuse  themselves  with  singing ; 
the  birds  whose  strains  are  of  deeper  sentiment.'^ 

This  is  the  Song  Sparrow.  He  is  the  most  constant  singer 
among  our  northern  birds ;  he  has  other  songs  in  his  reper- 
toire beside  love-songs,  even  though  he  excels  in  these,  his 
later  efforts  lacking  their  variety.  He  sings  to  you  from 
the  snow-powdered  trees  in  February,  to  keep  up  your 
spirits.  In  March  he  comes  out  on  a  bush  and  tells  you 
that  the  buds  are  swelling  and  that  it  is  really  spring.  In 
April,  May,  and  June  he  is  in  an  ecstasy ;  he  sings  to  his 
mate,  to  the  earth,  to  the  sky,  and  to  you,  varying  his  theme 
until  the  simple  melody  of  three  notes  and  an  appoggiatura 
is  lost  in  endless  changes. 

In  July  his  song  loses  quality,  and  August  heat  drives 
him,  somewhat  discouraged,  to  moult  in  bushy  seclusion,  but 
does  not  wholly  silence  him.  With  middle  September  he 
emerges  and  begins  anew,  greeting  the  migrating  birds  as 
they  return ;  and  all  through  October  his  notes  sound  clearly 
above  the  rustling  leaves,  and  some  morning  he  comes  to 
the  dogwood  by  the  arbour  and  announces  the  first  frost  in 
a  song  that  is  more  direct  than  that  in  which  he  told  of 
spring.  While  the  chestnuts  fall  from  their  velvet  nests, 
he  is  singing  in  the  hedge ;  but  when  the  brush  heaps  burn 

157 


Song  Sparrow  SONG-BIRDS. 

away  to  fragrant  smoke  in  November,  they  veil  his  song  a 
little,  but  it  still  continues. 

December  daunts  him,  —  so  long  to  spring,  he  thinks,  but 
even  then  a  warm  sunbeam  draws  out  a  note  or  two ;  and 
when  January's  iron  hand  numbs  him,  he  whispers,  "so 
long  since  summer,"  and  breathes  a  note  in  undertone  for 
memory's  sake;  so  is  completed  this  Sparrow's  year  of 
song. 

Swamp  Song  Sparrow :  Melospiza  georgiana. 

Length:  4.50-4.80  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Crown  bright  bay,  gray  stripe  over  eye  and  gray 

wash   over  brown  around  neck.     Back  striped  with  various 

browns.     Tail  reddish  brown.    Much  bay  on  wings.     Mottled 

gray  below. 
Song :  A  liquid  though  monotonous  trill. 
Season :  Migrant ;  March  and  April,  October  and  November.    Breeds 

here  sparingly. 
Breeds  :  From  Northern  States  northward. 
Nest  and  Eggs :  In  tussock  or  bush  in  swamp,  otherwise  like  Song 

Sparrow's  ;  eggs  also  similar. 
Bange :  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains,  accidentally  to  Utah, 

north  to  the  British  Provinces,  including  Newfoundland  and 

Labrador.     Winters  in  the  Middle  States  and  southward. 

The  distinctive  marks  of  the  Swamp  Song  Sparrow  are 
its  bright  hay  crown,  hay  wing-edges,  and  absence  of  any  yel- 
low washes,  or  white  tail  feathers.  The  Chipping  Sparrow 
has  the  bay  crown,  but  lacks  the  bay  on  the  wings ;  the 
Vesper  Sparrow  has  the  bay  wings,  but  lacks  the  crown, 
but  the  Swamp  Sparrow  has  both. 

This  Sparrow  has  neither  the  vocal  powers  or  the  sociabil- 
ity of  the  Song  Sparrow.  It  is  a  shy  bird  that  loves  deep, 
cool  thickets  and  haunts  such  impenetrable  shrubberies  as 
border  sphagnum  bogs;  and  though  it  is  common  in  such 
places,  when  you  look  for  it  you  will  find  it  as  elusive  as 
the  Veery  and  Marsh  Wrens. 

Its  fresh  trill  can  be  heard  from  middle  April  until  it 
passes  on  in  May ;  where  it  breeds  it  sings  almost  continu-

ously  until  August,  and  after  moulting  has  an  intermittent 
period  of  song  before  it  leaves  in  October. 


Fox  Sparrow :  Passerella  iliaca. 


Length:  6.50-7.25  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  The  largest  and  reddest  of  the  Sparrows,  the  size 
of  the  Hermit  Thrush.  Above  red-brown,  varying  from  dark 
to  bright  chestnut,  brightest  on  rump  and  tail.  Breast  light 
gray,  arrowhead  markings  on  throat  and  breast,  sides  streaked 
with  reddish  brown.  Bill  dark  above,  lower  mandible  yellow- 
ish, feet  pale. 

Song:  A  sweet,  varied  warble,  sometimes  heard  during  migrations. 
Call  note  a  feeble  zip-zip. 

Season:  In  migrations.  Common  in  March,  April,  October,  and 
November.     Found  by  Mr.  Averill  as  late  as  December  29. 

Breeds :  North  of  the  United  States. 

Nest :  Usual  Ground  Sparrow  nest. 

Eggs :  Greenish  white,  speckled  with  red-brown. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America,  west  to  the  Plains  and  Alaska  (val- 
ley of  the  Yukon  to  the  Pacific),  and  from  the  Arctic  coast 
south  to  the  United  States.  Winters  chiefly  south  of  the  Poto- 
mac and  Ohio  rivers. 

This  bird,  whose  fox-red  feathers,  and  not  a  sly  dispo- 
sition, give  it  the  name  of  Fox  Sparrow,  is  a  delightful 
songster  as  well  as  a  large  and  boldly  marked  species. 
They  come  in  flocks  in  very  early  spring,  —  when  the  Blue- 
bird and  Song  Sparrow  are  sharing  the  musical  honours,  — 
and,  settling  on  the  pastures,  send  up  a  wave  of  gentle 
music,  and  when  they  return  in  autumn  they  still  give  a 
few  soft  notes. 

Mr.  Bicknell  has  heard  them  sing  as  early  as  February 
29  and  as  late  as  November  17.  He  says  that  this 
Sparrow  seems  indisposed  to  sing  unless  present  in  num- 
bers. This  probably  applies  only  to  the  anti-nuptial  song ; 
for,  as  a  rule,  the  perfect  song  of  wild  birds  is  not  heard 
before  they  leave  and  after  they  rejoin  the  flocks,  but  only 
at  the  period  when  they  assert  themselves  as  individuals.

Towhee  SONG-BIRDS. 

Towhee:    JPipilo  erythrophthalmus* 

Chewirik,  Ground  Robin. 

Plate  31. 

Length:  7.50-8.75  inches. 

Male :  Head,  neck,  chest,  back,  and  all  but  outer  tail  feathers  black. 
Belly  and  spots  on  outer  tail  feathers  white,  sides  light  bay. 
Bill  black  ;  feet  light  brown. 

Female:  Drab  or  brownish  where  the  male  is  black. 

Song :  Clear  and  ringing,  "  Teweek — tew6ek — towhee— blure— towhee 
blure!" 

Season :  Common  summer  resident ;  late  April  to  October. 

Breeds :  In  its  range  generally. 

Nest :  On  the  ground  ;  of  grass,  fibres,  hair,  etc.  ;  large  but  well  con- 
cealed by  underbrush. 

Eggs;  White,  heavily  speckled  with  brown. 

Bange:  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada,  west  to  the 
Plains. 

In  early  May  when  the  Thrushes  are  scratching  in  the 
shrubbery,  a  stranger  appears  among  them,  clad  in  bay, 
white,  and  black,  who  hops  with  such  exaggerated  precision 
that  he  seems  like  a  messenger  bearing  important  news. 
But  it  is  only  another  of  the  Sparrow  tribe,  wearing  the 
thick  bill  of  the  Buntings.  He  has  probably  been  in 
the  vicinity  a  week  or  two  but  has  kept  aloof.  He  bears 
the  local  name  of  Ground  Eobin,  because  he  nests  upon  the 
ground  and  has  partially  reddish  under  parts. 

Although  common  summer  residents  they  are  so  shy  that 
they  are  rarely  seen  after  the  breeding-season.  If  you  ap- 
proach the  nest,  the  male  will  run  through  the  bushes  in  an 
opposite  direction,  uttering  his  sharp  "  teweek,  towhee  "  (a 
note  which  suggested  the  name  Towhee)  and  in  his  anxiety 
exposes  himself  fully  to  view.  Late  in  the  afternoon  he 
mounts  a  tree,  at  some  distance  from  his  nest,  and  rings  out 
his  rather  defiant  song. 

He  is  a  very  restless  bird,  prying  about  continually  for 
seeds  and  insects,  upon  which  he  feeds  equally,  and  in 
autumn  he  also  eats  such  berries  as  he  can  glean.  After 
the  moulting  he  only  gives  his  call  note  and,  being  affected

Cardinal  Grosbeak,  Virginia  Nightingale. 

Plate  32. 

Length  .•  8-9  inches. 

Male :  Magnificent  red,  conspicuously  crested ;  black  throat  and  band 

around  beak.     Wings  at  some  seasons  washed  with  gray.     Bill 

light  red  ;  feet  brown. 
Female :  Brownish  yellow  ;  crest,  wings,  and  tail  reddish. 
Song:  A  full,  rich  whistle,  —  "  Cheo-cheo-chehoo-cheo  !  "     Female 

also  sings. 
Season :  A  notable  bird  of  the  Southern  States,  straggling  as  far  north 

as  Massachusetts. 
Breeds :  Through  its  range. 
Nest :  Bulky  and  loosely  made  of  bark,  leaves,  and  grass  placed  in  a 

bush. 
Hggs :  Pale  gray,  marked  with  brown,  varying  from  red  to  chocolate. 
Bange:  Eastern  United  States,  north  to  New  Jersey  and  the  Ohio 

Valley  (casually  farther),  west  to  the  Plains. 

As  a  cage  bird  the  Cardinal  is  familiar  to  nearly  every 
one;  although  in  confinement  he  soon  loses  the  brilliancy 
of  his  plumage,  he  often  keeps  his  full  song.  He  is  regarded 
as  a  semi-tropical  species,  yet  in  the  breeding-season  he 
strays  into  the  New  England  States;  winters  plentifully 
in  lower  Pennsylvania,  while  a  small  colony  are  resident  in 
Central  Park,  New  York. 

The  Cardinal  owes  many  of  his  misfortunes  to  his  "  fatal 
gift  of  beauty."  It  is  simply  impossible  that  he  should 
escape  notice,  and  to  be  seen,  in  spite  of  laws  to  the  con- 
trary, means  that  he  will  either  be  trapped,  shot,  or  perse- 
cuted out  of  the  country.  The  fact  that  this  bird  has  not 
become  extinct  is  a  wonderful  proof  of  the  endurance  and 
persistency  of  the  species. 

In  the  vicinity  of  New  York,  Mr.  Bicknell  says  that  its 

song  lasts  from  April  to  August,  and  that  he  has  seen  the 

Cardinal  in  every  month  from  October  to  March.     Wilson 

writes  that  the  full  song  lasts,  in  the  South,  from  March  to

Grosbeak  SONG-BIRDS. 

September,  and  that  in  January  and  February  this  bird's 
clear  notes  are  the  only  music.  In  Europe,  where  they  are 
highly  prized  as  cage  birds,  the  name  of  Virginia  Nightin- 
gale is  given  them. 

The  most  delicate  and  pathetic  description  of  this  bird, 
whose  beauty  is  his  knell,  is  to  be  found  in  J.  L.  Allen's 
"  Kentucky  Cardinal,"  —  that  story  in  which  a  knowledge 
of  wild  Nature  and  of  the  human  heart  are  so  perfectly 
blended :  —  "  Lo !  some  morning  the  leaves  are  on  the  ground, 
and  the  birds  have  vanished.  The  species  that  remain,  or 
that  come  to  us  then,  wear  the  hues  of  the  season  and  melt 
into  the  tone  of  Nature's  background,  —  blues,  grays, 
browns,  with  touches  of  white  on  tail  and  breast  and  wing 
for  coming  flecks  of  snow. 

"  Save  only  him,  —  proud,  solitary  stranger  to  our  un- 
friendly land,  —  the  fiery  Grosbeak.  Nature  in  Kentucky 
has  no  wintry  harmonies  for  him.  He  could  find  these 
only  among  the  tufts  of  the  October  sumach,  or  in  the  gum- 
tree  when  it  stands  a  pillar  of  red  twilight  fire  in  the  dark 
November  woods,  or  in  the  far  depths  of  the  crimson  sun- 
set skies,  where,  indeed,  he  seems  to  have  been  nested,  and 
whence  to  have  come  as  a  messenger  of  beauty,  bearing  on 
his  wings  the  light  of  his  diviner  home.  .  .  .  What  won- 
der if  he  is  so  shy,  so  rare,  so  secluded,  this  flame-coloured 
prisoner  in  dark  green  chambers,  who  has  only  to  be  seen 
or  heard  and  Death  adjusts  an  arrow !  .  .  .  He  will  sit  for 
a  long  time  in  the  heart  of  a  cedar,  as  if  absorbed  in  the 
tragic  memories  of  his  race.  Then,  softly,  wearily,  he  will 
call  out  to  you  and  to  the  whole  world :  Peace  .  .  .  Peace 
.  .  .  PeoAie  .  .  .  Peace  .  .  .  Peace  .  .  . !  —  the  most  melo- 
dious sigh  that  ever  issued  from  the  clefts  of  a  dungeon."

SONG-BIRDS.  Grosbeak 

Female :  Brownish,  sulphur-yellow  under  wings  ;  no  rosy  tint ;  heavy 

brown  bill. 
Song :  A  delightful,  rolling  warble,  often  heard  toward  evening. 
Season :  Common  summer  resident ;  May  1  to  middle  September. 
Breeds :  From  the  Middle  States  northward. 
Kest:  A  perfect  circle,  neatly  made  of  fibres  and  grass,  lined  with 

finer  grasses,  placed  in  a  low  tree,  or  more  frequently  a  thorn 

bush  in  old  pastures  near  the  edge  of  woods. 
Eggs :  Dirty  green,  with  dark  brown  spots  and  speckles. 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada  ;  west  to  the 

eastern  border  of  the  Plains  ;  south  in  winter  to  Cuba,  Central 

America,  and  northern  South  America. 

You  will  always  remember  th.e  day  when  you  first  see 
this  Grosbeak.  Its  song  may  be  familiar  to  you,  though 
you  are  wholly  unconscious  of  it;  for  in  the  great  spring 
chorus  you  may  mistake  it  for  a  particularly  melodious 
Eobin,  who  has  added  a  few  Oriole  notes  to  his  repertoire. 
The  Grosbeak's  song,  however,  has  a  retrospective  quality 
all  its  own,  and  shared  by  neither  Robin  or  Oriole,  —  a  sort 
of  dreaminess,  in  keeping  with  its  habit  of  singing  into  the 
night.  Gibson  says  that  its  song  is  suffused  with  colour 
like  a  luscious  tropic  fruit  rendered  into  sound. 

The  songster  itself,  if  seen  feeding,  as  it  sometimes  does, 
upon  the  grass,  is  a  dark,  clumsy-looking  bird,  with  an  awk- 
ward beak ;  and  it  is  only  when  you  look  at  it  from  beneath, 
as  it  perches  in  the  trees,  that  you  see  the  rosy  shield  and 
flush  under  the  outspread  wings. 

I  first  identified  bird  and  song  one  June  twilight,  after  a 
day  when  the  roses  had  burst  into  sudden  bloom;  and  it 
seemed  as  if  their  glorious  colour  was  reflected  on  this  novel 
bird  and  mingled  with  his  song.  I  have  never  found  the 
nest  near  here,  but  Mr.  Averill  says  that  they  breed  freely 
in  the  vicinity,  and  that  this  spring  he  saw  a  male  covering 
the  nest,  an  unusual  occurrence  with  birds  of  such  conspic- 
uous colouring. 

In  some  parts  of  Pennsylvania,  according  to  Dr.  Warren, 
the  farmers  protect  this  Grosbeak,  owing  to  its  services  in 
killing  potato-bugs,  and  have  christened  it  the  Potato-bug 
Bird.     Its  diet  is  varied,  comprising  beetles,  flies,  larvae,

seeds,  the  buds   of  hickory,  beech,  and  birch,  and  fruit 
blossoms. 

The  distribution  of  the  Grosbeak  is  somewhat  irregular ; 
it  will  be  common  on  one  side  of  a  river  and  rare  on  the 
other,  or  plentiful  on  both  sides  of  a  range  of  hills  and  un- 
known among  the  hills  themselves.  The  song  is  continued 
well  into  August,  but  the  bird  is  quite  silent  before  leaving 
in  September.  Two  or  three  years  are  required  to  bring  the 
rose-coloured  markings  to  perfection ;  but  Mr.  Bicknell  once 
shot  a  young  male  on  the  23,  of  September,  whose  breast 
was  crimsoning,  and  who  was  in  full  song.  This  last  fact 
adds  proof  to  a  pet  theory  of  my  own,  that  the  best  autumn 
music  is  made  by  the  birds  of  the  season. 

Indigo  Bunting:   JPasserina  cyanea, 

Plate  34. 

Length:  5.50  inches. 

Male :  Deep  blue  (in  some  lights,  having  a  greenish  cast) ,  deepest  on 

head;    rump,  wmgs,  and  tail  washed  thinly  with   brownish. 

Bill  dark  above,  lighter  below. 
Female :  Above,  warm  brown,  whitening  on  breast. 
Song :  Sweet  but  weak, —  "  Tshe — tshe — tshe — tshay  ! " 
Season :  Middle  of  May  to  third  week  in  September. 
Breeds :  Through  its  United  States  range. 
Nest :  In  bushes,  bulky  and  rude,  of  leaves  and  grass. 
Eggs :  Bluish  or  pure  white,  with  brown  spots, 
Bange :  Eastern  United  States,  south,  in  winter,  to  Veragua. 

Beautiful  plumage  and  a  very  small  voice  is  the  sum  of 
the  Indigo  Bunting's  attractions.  It  comes  about  the  middle 
of  May  with  the  Scarlet  Tanager,  and  if  you  should  chance 
to  find  these  birds  in  company,  as  sometimes  happens,  rest- 
ing on  the  same  rough  fence  rail,  while  a  Goldfinch  swings 
near  them  among  the  wayside  grasses,  you  will  have  seen 
the  primary  colours  as  illustrated  in  bird  life. 

When  the  Bunting  feeds  upon  the  ground,  as  is  his  usual 
habit,  his  food  consisting  mainly  of  the  seed  of  small  grasses 
and  herbs,  his  plumage  is  brought  out  wonderfully  by  the 
play  of  light  upon  it,  varying  from  deep  blue  to  a  tint  of 
verde  antique,  unlike  the  Bluebird's  sky  colour.

SONG-BIRDS.  Bobolink 

The  most  likely  place  to  find  him  is  in  old,  bush-grown 
pastures,  and  along  the  lane  hedges;  like  all  the  bright- 
hued  birds  he  is  beset  by  enemies  both  of  earth  and  sky, 
but  his  Sparrow  instinct,  which  has  a  love  for  mother- 
earth,  bids  him  build  near  the  ground.  The  dangers  of  the 
nesting-time  fall  mostly  to  his  share,  for  his  dull  brown 
mate  is  easily  overlooked  as  an  insignificant  Sparrow.  Na- 
ture almost  always  gives  a  plain  coat  to  the  wives  of  these 
gayly  dressed  cavaliers,  for  her  primal  thought  is  the  safety 
of  the  home  and  its  young  life.

Plate  35. 
Length :  6.50-7  inches. 
Male:  Black  head,  chin,  tail,  wings,  and  under  parts.    Buff  patch  on 

back  of  neck  ;  also  buff  edges  to  some  tail  and  wing  feathers. 

Rump  and  upper  wing  coverts  white.    Bill  brown.     In  autumn

Female:  Below  yellowish  brown.    Above  striped  brown,  except  on 

rump,  with  yellow  and  white  tips  to  some  feathers.    Two  dark 

stripes  on  crown. 
Song :  A  delightful,  incoherent  melody ;  sung  oftentimes  as  the  bird 

soars  upward. 
Season  :  Early  May  to  October. 
Breeds :  From  the  middle  United  States  northward,  and  winters  south 

of  the  United  States. 
Nest :  A  loose  heap  of  twigs  and  grass  on  the  ground  in  low  meadows 

and  hay-fields  ;  common,  but  very  difficult  to  discover. 
Eggs :  4-6,  clear  gray,  with  clouds  and  markings  of  dark  brown. 
Hange :  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Great  Plains,  north  to  south- 
em  Canada ;  south,  in  winter,  to  the  West  Indies  and  South 

America. 

The  Bobolink,  the  bird  of  two  lives  in  one!  The  wild, 
ecstatic  black  and  buff  singer,  who  soars  above  the  May 
meadows,  leaving  a  trail  of  rippling  music,  and  in  autumn 
the  brown  striped  bird  who,  voiceless  but  for  a  metallic 
"chink,"  is  hunted  through  the  marshes  by  the  gunners, 

165 


Bobolink  SONG-BIRDS. 

making  his  last  appearance  as  an  article  of  food,  heralded 
on  the  restaurant  bill  of  fare  thus :  "  Keed-birds,  four  on  a 
skewer,  50  cents." 

Strange  to  say  that  two-thirds  of  the  gunners  who  do  the 
shooting  deny  that  the  birds  are  identical  and  that  they  are 
killing  so  much  latent  music.  "The  brown  birds  are  all 
females,"  they  say,  "  which,  being  greatly  in  excess  of  the 
males,  remain  after  the  latter  have  disappeared."  I  would 
advise  all  such  incredulous  ones  to  buy  The  Auk  (an  intel- 
ligible ornithological  quarterly)  for  October,  1893,  where 
they  will  find  a  paper  on  this  subject  by  Mr.  Frank  M. 
Chapman,  and  a  coloured  plate  showing  the  Bobolink  life- 
sized,  in  the  spring  transition,  when  he  is  again  moulting 
the  stripes  for  the  breeding-coat. 

Of  all  our  songsters  none  enter  into  the  literature  of  fact 
and  fancy  more  fully  than  the  Bobolink,  and  none  so  exhila- 
rates us  by  his  song.  Sit  upon  the  fence  of  an  upland 
meadow  any  time  from  early  May  until  the  last  of  June, 
watch  and  listen.  Up  from  the  grass  the  Bobolinks  fly, 
some  singing  and  dropping  again,  others  rising  Lark-like 
until  the  distant  notes  sound  like  the  tinkling  of  an 
ancient  clavichord.  Then,  while  you  are  gazing  skyward, 
from  the  choke-cherry  tree  above  your  head  will  come  the 
hurried  syllables  in  which  Mr.  Burroughs  interprets  the 
song :  "  Ha !  Ha !  Ha !  I  must  have  my  fun,  Miss  Silver- 
thimble,  if  I  break  every  heart  in  the  meadow,  see,  see,  see ! " 
Meanwhile,  the  grass  is  full  of  nests  and  brown  mothers, 
neither  of  which  you  see,  for  you  are  wholly  entranced  by 
the  song. 

Bryant's  poem  on  Robert  of  Lincoln  contains  a  good 
description  of  the  bird's  plumage,  but  is  too  precise  and 
measured  to  express  the  rapture  of  the  song.  It  may  de- 
scribe a  stuffed  Bobolink,  but  never  a  wild,  living  one.  Wil- 
son Flagg's  verses  on  The  O'Lincon  Family,  one  of  which 
I  quote,  are  in  truer  key :  — 

"Every  one's  a  funny  fellow;  every  one's  a  little  mellow; 
Follow,  follow,  follow,  follow,  o'er  the  hill  and  in  the  hollow. 
Merrily,  merrily,  there  they  hie ;  now  they  rise  and  now  they  fly ;

They  cross  and  turn,  and  in  and  out,  and  down  the  middle  and  wheel

With  a  '  Phew,  shew,  Wadolincon  ;  listen  to  me,  Bobolincon  ! 
Happy's  the  wooing  that's  speedily  doing,  that's  speedily  doing, 
That's  merry  and  over  with  the  bloom  of  the  clover ; 
Bobolincon,  Wadolincon,  Winterseeble,  follow,  follow  me  ! '" 

Tlie  prose  writers  vie  with  the  poets  in  singing  the  Bobo- 
link's praises,  their  own  words  turning  to  music  under  his 
spell.  Listen  to  what  Thoreau  says  of  the  song:  "It  is 
as  if  he  [the  bird]  touched  his  harp  with  a  vase  of  liquid 
melody,  and  when  he  lifted  it  out  the  notes  fell  like  bubbles 
from  the  strings."  ..."  away  he  launches,  and  the  meadow 
is  all  bespattered  with  melody." 

What  matters  it  to  us  who  hear  his  song  in  the  north  if 
the  singer,  in  his  migrations,  is  at  war  with  the  rice-growers 
of  warmer  regions  ?  Here  he  is  the  peerless  musician,  whom 
no  one  should  wittingly  destroy;  and  yet  we  buy  "Eeed- 
birds,  four  on  a  skewer,  for  50  cents." 

Cowbird ;  Molothrus  ater. 

Plate  39.     Fig.  1. 

Length:  7.50-8  inches. 

Male :  Head,  throat,  and  shoulders  glistening  dark  brown ;  all  other 
parts  iridescent  black.  Bill  dark  brown ;  feet  rusty  black.  A 
walker. 

Female :  Dull,  brownish  gray. 

Song :  A  whistle  and  a  few  short,  rasping  notes.  Call  note,  "  Cluck- 
see  !  " 

Season :  March  to  November  ;  occasionally  winters. 

Breeds :  Through  range. 

Nest :  Builds  none,  but  lays  its  eggs  at  random  in  the  nests  of  other 
birds,  usually  choosing  those  of  species  smaller  than  itself. 

Eggs :  Almost  an  inch  long,  white,  speckled  with  brown  and  various 
shades  of  gray. 

Bange :  United  States  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Pacific ;  north  into 
southern  British  America  ;  south,  in  winter,  into  Mexico. 

The  Cowbird  is  the  pariah  of  bird-dom,  the  exception 
that  proves  the  rule  of  marital  fidelity  and  good  housekeep- 
ing.    It  is  the  bird  that  you  see  so  frequently  in  pastures, 

167 


Cowbird  SONG-BIRDS. 

walking  after  the  grazing  cattle  and  feeding  upon  the  insects 
dislodged  from  the  grass  by  their  cropping.  Other  birds 
build  a  home  and  seek  a  mate,  often  remaining  with  the 
same  one  a  lifetime.  The  Cowbirds  are  polygamous,  liv- 
ing in  roving  flocks,  building  no  nests,  and  providing  in  no 
way  for  their  offspring.  When  the  laying  impulse  seizes 
them,  they  slyly  deposit  the  egg  in  the  nest  of  some  smaller 
bird.  This  shows  forethought,  however ;  for  there  is  less 
likelihood  of  the  eggs  being  thrust  out,  and  it  also  obtains 
a  greater  share  of  warmth  than  the  other  eggs  in  the  nest 
and  hatches  more  rapidly. 

Many  birds  do  not  allow  themselves  to  be  so  imposed 
upon,  and  either  eject  the  strange  egg,  build  a  new  nest 
over  it,  or  abandon  their  nest  entirely;  others  seemingly 
less  intelligent  will  rear  the  ungainly  stranger,  even  though 
from  its  greater  size  and  appetite  it  crowds  and  starves  the 
legitimate  tenants  of  the  nest.  I  have  many  and  many  a 
time  seen  a  young  Cowbird,  after  leaving  the  nest,  being 
fed  by  a  bird  so  much  smaller  than  itself  that  the  poor 
foster  parent  had  to  stand  on  tiptoe. 

Cowbirds'  eggs  have  been  found  in  the  nests  of  the  Chat, 
Baltimore  Oriole,  Wood  Thrush,  Mourning  Dove,  Kingbird, 
Towhee,  Vireos,  Warblers,  and  all  the  Sparrows,  and  even 
in  the  secluded  hut  of  the  Ovenbird,  while  many  nests  are 
so  unfortunate  as  to  contain  more  than  one  of  these  eggs. 

Vagrants  as  the  Cowbirds  are  in  the  breeding-season, 
after  the  nesting  the  young  do  not  continue  with  their 
foster  parents,  but  return  to  the  flocks  of  their  progenitors, 
and  remain  with  them.  Thus  these  Cowbirds  are  the  social- 
ists among  birds,  and  are  like  their  human  prototypes,  who 
send  their  young  to  free  kindergartens  and  mission  schools 
that  they  may  be  fed  and  clothed  at  the  expense  of  others ; 
then  drawing  them  surely  back,  with  their  inherited  prin- 
ciples unchanged.  Some  evils  are  inextricably  mixed  up 
with  the  foundations  of  things.

Red' winged  Blackbird :    Agelaius  phoeniceus, 

Plate  36. 

Length :  Very  variable ;  8.25-9.85  inches. 

3fale :  Rich  blue-black ;  scarlet  shoulders,  edged  with  yellow. 

Female:    Finely   speckled  with   rusty   black,   brown,    and   orange. 

Shoulders  obscurely  orange-red. 
Song :  A  rich,  juicy  note,  —  "  Oucher-la-ree-6  !  " 
Season :  Late  March  to  October.     Sometimes  winters. 
Breeds :  Through  summer  range. 
Nest :  A  bulky  pocket  hung  between  reeds  or  stems  of  alders,  etc. ; 

made  of  rush  blades  and  grass,  and  lined  with  finer  grasses. 
Eggs :  4-6,  light  blue,  fancifully  marked  with  lines,  dots,  and  patches 

of  black  and  lilac. 
Range :  North  America  in  general,  from  Great  Slave  Lake  south  to 

Costa  Rica. 

As  a  summer  resident  the  Ked-winged  Blackbird  is  a 
familiar  sight  in  low  meadows  and  along  roadsides.  At  a 
little  distance  he  appears  to  be  only  a  plain,  black  bird,  but 
as  he  extends  his  wings  his  brilliant  epaulets  come  into 
prominence.  The  plumage  of  the  female,  though,  incon- 
spicuous, is  singularly  beautiful  when  seen  at  close  range. 
It  looks  like  a  fabric  of  which  the  warp  is  black  and  the 
woof  a  twisted  thread  of  brown  and  yellow.  The  Ked- 
wings  are  essentially  early  birds,  often  returning  in  spring 
when  their  marshy  haunts  are  still  frozen  over.  Their 
vocalization  is  suggestive  of  cool,  moist  ground  and  hidden 
springs ;  it  continues  until  late  July,  and  is  briefly  renewed 
in  October.  The  deep  nest  is  half  hung,  half  twined 
between  the  stems  of  marsh-growing  plants,  and  often 
holds  two  broods  of  a  season;  the  boggy  location  chosen 
serves  to  protect  it  quite  thoroughly  from  human  invaders. 

This  Blackbird's  clear  notes  are  associated  with  those  of 
the  Meadowlark,  as  they  are  both  early  singers  and  are 
found  in  similar  places.  They  are  useful  birds  to  the  agri- 
culturist, as  they  are  great  destroyers  of  cutworms.  They 
are  sometimes  polygamous,  though  as  frequently  seen  in 
pairs ;  being  very  gregarious  birds,  many  nests  are  usually 
found  in  the  same  locality.

Meadowlark  SONG-BIRDS. 

Meadowlark:  Sturnella  magna* 

Plate  1. 

Length:  10.75  incties. 

Male  a7id  Female :  Much  variegated  above,  general  colour  brown.  Bill 
stout  and  straight.  Crown  with  brown  and  black  streaks,  black 
line  behind  eye.  Tail  black  with  white  outer  quills  ;  wings  edged 
with  yellow.  Under  parts  yellow,  black  crescent  on  throat. 
Strong  legs,  a  walker.     Female  paler. 

Song  :  Clear  and  piercing,  —  "  Spring  o'  the  Y-e-a-r  I  " 

Season :  A  resident,  the  migrants  remaining  from  April  until  late 
October. 

Breeds  :  Abundantly  throughout  its  range. 

Nest :  Of  dried  grass  ;  placed  on  the  ground  ;  usually  concealed  by  a 
tuft  of  grass,  which  makes  a  partial  roof. 

Eggs :  4-6,  brilliant  white,  speckled  with  purple  and  reddish  brown. 

Range :  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada,  to  the  Plains. 

This  abundant  bird,  common  in  the  migrations,  and  present 
with  us  all  winter  in  considerable  numbers,  is  not  a  Lark  at 
all ;  it  has  superb  plumage,  and  its  song,  though  consisting 
of  but  a  few  syllables,  is  sweet  and  thrilling.  Almost 
before  a  tinge  of  green  has  come  upon  the  meadows,  these 
birds  are  searching  for  worms  and  larvse,  which  form  a  large 
part  of  their  diet,  and  it  is  at  this  time  that  they  show  their 
yellow  breasts,  with  the  striking  black  crescent,  to  the  best 
advantage.  While  they  are  feeding,  they  constantly  give 
their  calling  song,  varying  the  intonation  and  accent  in  a 
way  which  is  very  expressive  — "  Spring  o'  the  Y-e-a-r, 
Spring  o'  the  Year ! "  It  has  a  breezy  sound,  as  fresh  and 
wild  as  if  the  wind  were  blowing  through  a  flute.  They  sing 
from  March  until  July,  and  then  again  after  the  moulting, 
though  at  this  time  they  never  equal  their  spring  song,  and 
I  have  heard  a  few  notes  in  January,  when  they  were  linger- 
ing about  the  stubble  fields.  In  winter  they  often  come 
about  the  barns  for  food,  and  will  stand  quite  still,  and 
watch  me  while  I  scatter  seeds  to  them  and  other  such  way- 
farers. 

The  Meadowlark  is  one  of  the  most  constant  of  the  win- 
ter colony,  associating  with  the  Horned  Lark  on  the  shore

meadows,  and  with  the  Snowflakes  in  the  inland  fields,  from 
which  he  announces  "  Spring  o'  the  Year "  with  his  pene- 
trating voice,  almost  before  that  coy  season  has  awaked  and 
warmed  her  fingers  in  the  sun's  grudging  rays. 

Orchard  Oriole:  Icterus  spurius. 

Plate  37. 

Length :  7  inches. 

Male  .-  Black  head,  chin,  neck,  throat,  tail,  and  part  of  wings.  Breast, 
belly,  rump,  and  shoulders  chestnut-brown.  White  wing  bar, 
and  some  feathers  edged  with  black  and  chestnut.  Round 
black  tail  edged  with  lighter.     Bill  and  feet  bluish  black. 

Female  :  Upper  parts  brown,  wings  with  pale  buff  edges  and  shoulder 
bars.  Throat  black,  rump  and  edges  of  some  tail  feathers  olive- 
green.     Under  parts  olive-yellow. 

Song :  Resembling  that  of  the  Baltimore  Oriole,  but  less  shrill. 

Season :  Summer  resident ;  May  to  September. 

Breeds :  Throughout  United  States  range. 

Nest :  A  round  basket-like  structure,  notable  for  its  even  weaving.  It 
may  be  pensile  or  only  partly  so,  and  is  usually  placed  in  a 
fruit  tree  at  a  moderate  height. 

Eggs :  4,  cloudy  white,  spotted  with  blackish  brown. 

Range :  United  States,  west  to  the  Plains ;  south,  in  winter,  to  Pan- 
ama. 

The  Orchard  Oriole  is  less  known  in  New  England  than 
the  Baltimore  Oriole,  not  only  because  of  its  duller  colouring 
but  because  its  range  is  more  southerly,  and  though  it  goes 
all  through  the  Eastern  States  it  is  not  plentiful  north  of 
Massachusetts. 

I  can  always  rely  upon  seeing  a  few  pairs  about  the  gar- 
den in  May,  when  the  early  apples  are  in  bloom ;  for  though 
these  Orioles  are  chiefly  insect-eaters,  they  will  sometimes 
help  themselves  to  the  fruit  blossoms,  and  later  on  to  an 
occasional  meal  from  the  raspberry  vines  or  the  strawberry 
bed.  These  depredations,  however,  are  trifling  in  compari- 
son to  the  good  they  do  in  destroying  plant-lice,  beetles,  rose- 
slugs,  and  cabbage-worms.

distinguisliable  in  tlie  bird  chorus ;  but  as  nest-builders  they 
excel,  and  there  is  no  nest  that  more  closely  resembles  man's 
primitive  efforts  at  basket-weaving.  It  is  usually  suspended 
between  branches  or  twigs,  and  is  woven  of  dried  grasses 
of  nearly  equal  size,  so  that  the  nest  is  very  neat  and  even. 
Old  orchards  are  favourite  haunts  of  this  bird,  for  it  is  very  shy 
and  seldom  builds  near  dwellings.  Its  song  season  is  brief, 
being  over  in  July,  and  even  immediately  after  the  nesting, 
when  the  young  birds  mingle  their  immature  plumage  and 
attempted  song,  the  identification  of  either  song  or  bird  is 
difficult  for  the  novice. 


Baltimore  Oriole:    Icterus  galbula. 

Golden  Oriole,  Hang-nest,  Golden  Bobin. 

Plate  38. 

Length :  8  inclies. 

Male :  Black  head,  throat,  and  upper  half  of  hack.  Wings  black, 
with  white  spots  and  edges ;  tail  quills  spotted  with  yellow. 
Everywhere  else  orange-flame.    Bill  and  feet  slatish  black. 

Female :  Paler,  the  black  washed  with  olive.     Below  dull  orange. 

Song:  Somewhat  shrill  and  interrogative,  but  withal  martial.  In 
the  breeding-season  they  have  an  anxious  call,  —  "Will  you? 
Will  you  really,  really,  truly?"  Female's  note  a  plaintive 
"I  w-i-11." 

Season :  1st  of  May  to  the  middle  of  September. 

Breeds :  Through  range. 

Nest:  A  pensile  pocket,  woven  of  milkweed,  flax,  fine  string,  or 
frayings  of  cotton,  rope,  etc. ;  suspended  at  the  end  of  a  sway- 
ing branch  at  considerable  distance  from  the  ground. 

Eggs :  4-6,  whitish  ground,  scrawled  with  black-brown. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States,  west  nearly  to  the  Rocky  Mountains. 

There  is  a  bit  of  history  as  well  as  tradition  connected 
with  the  naming  of  this  splendid  bird.  George  Calvert, 
the  first  Baron  Baltimore,  who  penned  the  charter  of  settle- 
ment in  1632  of  the  country  which  now  comprises  the 
states  of  Delaware  and  Maryland  (a  grant  which  fructified 
later  for  the  benefit  of  his  son),  is  the  subject  of  the  tradi- 
tion which  still  lingers  in  Maryland,  and  has  sufficient  facts 

172 


SONG-BIRDS.  Baltimore  Oriole 

for  a  foundation  to  be  credible.  The  story  says  that  Cal- 
vert, worn  out  and  discouraged  by  the  various  trials  and 
rigours  of  temperature  in  his  Newfoundland  colony,  in  1628 
visited  the  Virginia  settlement.  He  explored  the  waters  of 
the  Chesapeake,  with  its  noble  tributaries  and  delicious 
climate,  and  found  the  shores  and  woods  teeming  with  birds, 
and  among  them  great  flocks  of  Orioles,  who  so  cheered 
him  by  their  song  and  colour  that  he  took  them  as  good 
omens  and  adopted  their  colours  for  his  own.  Be  this  as  it 
may,  it  is  a  likely  story ;  for  the  Oriole  has  gone  on  cheering 
and  charming  mankind  to  this  day. 

The  Oriole  comes  in  full  plumage  and  song  in  time  to 
sing  the  praises  of  the  blooming  orchards,  but  if  the  season 
is  cold  and  late  and  the  cherries  do  not  yield  their  mimic 
snow-storm,  —  my  Lord  Baltimore  also  delays  his  coming. 
When  these  Orioles  first  arrive  the  males  are  in  the  majority, 
and  they  sit  in  the  spruces  calling  by  the  hour,  with  a  lonely 
querulous  note. 

In  a  few  days  the  females  appear  in  force,  and  then  the 
martial  music  begins,  and  the  birds'  golden  trumpeting  often 
turns  to  a  desperate  clashing  of  cymbals  when  two  males 
engage  in  combat ;  for  the  Oriole  has  a  temper  to  match  his 
flaming  plumage  and  fights  with  a  will. 

The  next  step  is  the  selection  of  a  nesting-tree.  It  must 
be  tall  with  swinging  branches  to  yield  when  the  wind 
blows,  and  near  enough  to  civilization  to  intimidate  the 

Hawks. 

Hush  !  'tis  he  ! 
My  Oriole,  my  glance  of  summer  fire, 
Is  come  at  last,  and  ever  on  the  watch, 
Twitches  the  pack-thread  I  had  lightly  wound 
About  the  bough  to  help  his  housekeeping,  — 
Twitches  and  scouts  by  turns,  blessing  his  luck, 
Yet  fearing  me  who  laid  it  in  his  way, 
Nor,  more  than  wiser  we  in  our  affairs, 
Divines  the  providence  that  hides  and  helps. 
Reave,  ho  I  Heave,  ho  !  he  whistles  as  the  twine 
Slackens  its  hold  ;  once  more,  now  !  and  a  flash 
Lightens  across  the  sunlight  to  the  elm 
Where  his  mate  dangles  at  her  cup  of  felt.  — Lowbll.

BalUmore  Oriole  SONG-BIRDS. 

If  the  situation  is  protected  from  birds  of  prey,  the  nest 
is  made  quite  open  at  the  top ;  but  if  it  is  in  a  wild  and 
remote  region,  the  structure  is  more  bottle-shaped,  with  a 
small  opening,  which  completely  hides  the  sitting  bird. 
This  accounts  for  the  great  variation  in  the  form  of  nests 
found  in  different  localities. 

The  Oriole  is  a  beneficent  garden  guest ;  his  food  is  largely 
insectivorous,  and  he  not  only  eats  worms  and  grubs,  but 
also  strips  cocoons  of  their  latent  mischief ;  so  we  will  not 
begrudge  him  a  few  cherries  for  dessert. 

He  is  a  quick-witted  bird,  and  a  good  neighbour  to  his 
fellows.  Many  instances  of  his  power  of  thinking  have 
come  under  my  eyes,  but  none  more  forcible  than  an  epi- 
sode of  last  season.  In  June  I  was  sitting  under  the  trees, 
watching  the  evolutions  of  a  pair  of  Eedstarts,  when  a  vio- 
lent commotion  in  the  shrubbery  attracted  me.  Catbirds 
were  screaming  lustily,  and  Kobins,  Wrens,  and  Sparrows 
collected  at  the  call  in  a  body,  while  a  gorgeous  Oriole  shot 
through  the  trees,  close  above  my  head.  The  cause  of  the 
rumpus  was  a  chipmunk,  who  had  dragged  a  young  Catbird 
from  the  nest  by  the  leg  (for  this  little  pest  steals  birds  as 
well  as  eggs,  though  I  have  never  seen  them  eat  a  bird). 
The  troop  of  birds  succeeded  in  frightening  away  the 
intruder,  and  I  returned  to  my  hammock,  thinking  no 
more  of  it.  Not  so  with  the  Oriole.  He  silently  watched 
the  chipmunk,  who  sat  chattering  in  a  pine.  Several  min- 
utes passed,  and  then  the  chipmunk  ran  out  in  full  view  on 
a  long  bough.  Quick  as  a  flash  the  Oriole  darted  at  him, 
and  pierced  the  poppy  eyes  with  his  slender  beak,  in  rapid 
succession.  The  unfortunate  chipmunk  fell  to  the  ground, 
and  was  put  out  of  misery,  while  the  Oriole  flew  off  as  if 
nothing  unusual  had  happened,  and  was  soon  swinging  and 
singing  in  the  elm  again,  the  type  of  summer  fervour.  Un- 
like many  highly  coloured  birds,  he  retains  his  brilliancy 
after  moulting,  and  also  has  a  second  period  of  song,  which 
lasts  from  August  until  early  September,  when  he  leaves  us.

You  may  identify  these  inconspicuous  Blackbirds  by 
their  pale,  straw-coloured  eyes,  and  the  rusty  wash  that 
dims  their  feathers,  also  from  the  fact  that  in  spring  they 
arrive  in  single  pairs  and  not  in  flocks  like  the  Grackles, 
while  in  fall  they  travel  in  small  flocks  and  mingle  with  the 
Cowbirds  in  the  pastures.

The  most  familiar  of  the  Blackbirds  as  well  as  the  most 
persecuted.  Hated  by  the  farmer  for  the  alleged  destruc- 
tion of  corn-fields  while  even  at  the  harvest  season,  they 
rid  the  soil  of  noxious  insects  and  grubs  and  all  the  rest  of 
the  year  are  either  harmless  gleaners  or  beneficial  scaven- 
gers, their  gravest  fault  being  that  they  sometimes  destroy 
and  eat  the  eggs  of  other  birds. 

The  Grackles  begin  their  upward  migration  early  in 
March,  and  some  gray  morning  an  immense  flock  will  ap- 
pear festooning  the  bare  tree,  in  which  they  settle  with 
scintillating  black,  uttering  at  the  same  time  a  series  of 
unique  and  discordant  cries  which  would  put  the  wildest 
banshee  to  shame.  Hereabout  they  always  choose  an  old 
stumpy  orchard  as  their  nesting-place  though  many  author- 
ities consider  that  they  nest  preferably  in  conifers,  —  Dr. 
Abbot  among  others,  giving  a  detailed  account  of  their 
preference,  during  a  particular  season,  for  pines,  ignoring 
the  great  beeches  where  they  had  previously  colonized. 

In  May  of  last  year  I  had  the  pleasure  of  watching  a 
fine  male  Grackle  sing  his  ludicrous  love-song.  Ludicrous 
from  my  point  of  view,  though  doubtless  from  a  Grackle's 
standpoint  it  was  exceedingly  thrilling,  and  the  lady  to 
whom  it  was  addressed  so  considered  it. 

It  was  the  15th  of  May,  and  the  Grackle  perched  in  my 
blighted  old  ash  tree,  displaying  his  glistening  coat  to  the 
best  advantage  in  the  afternoon  sun.  The  female  was 
coyly  hidden  in  the  dogwood  below  him.  Suddenly  he 
spread  his  wings  and  tail,  ruffed  his  breast,  at  the  same 
time  rising  on  tiptoe,  like  a  melodramatic  tenor,  and  uttered 
a  high  squeak  expressive  of  his  deep  emotion.  I  expected 
that  the  female  would  fly  away  in  disgust,  but  no,  at  each 
outburst  she  crept  nearer  and  nearer  and  finally  ventured 
upon  the  same  branch  that  held  the  frantic  singer. 

The  flocking  of  the  Grackles  in  early  September  is  one

gray,  with  brown  spots.

When  you  see  Jays  in  small  flocks  circling  the  trees  in 
early  spring  and  gathering  their  crop  of  chestnuts  in  the 
fall  and  acorns  in  early  winter,  you  admire  their  brilliant 
colouring,  jaunty  crest  and  bold  flight,  merely  wishing  per- 
haps that  their  cry  was  less  harsh. 

But  how  do  these  birds  amuse  themselves  in  the  period 
between  April  and  September,  in  their  breeding  and  moult- 
ing season,  when  they  are  comparatively  inconspicuous,  for 
they  go  into  the  woods  to  breed  and  become  almost  silent, 
—  it  is  a  case  of  still  waters  running  deeply  ?  Day  by  day 
they  sally  out  of  their  nesting-places  to  market  for  them- 
selves and  for  their  young,  and  nothing  will  do  for  them  but 
fresh  eggs  and  tender  squabs  from  the  nests  of  the  Song- 
birds ;  to  be  followed  later  by  berries,  small  fruit,  and  grain. 
There  are  birds  that  have  all  the  domestic  virtues  coupled

with  personal  beauty  and  interesting  habits ;  birds  who  are 
of  benefit  to  general  agriculture,  but  still  make  themselves 
very  unwelcome  in  the  home  woods  or  about  the  gardens 
of  the  lovers  of  Song-birds.  Of  this  class  the  Jay  and  the 
Crow,  fellow  members  of  one  famil}^,  are  conspicuous  exam- 
ples, the  Crow  of  course  lacking  the  attribute  of  beauty. 

It  is  interesting  to  be  assured  by  Mr.  Beal's  report  ^  that 
"  19  per  cent  of  the  Blue  Jay's  food  consists  of  harmful  in- 
sects .  .  .  and  that  the  habit  of  robbing  the  nests  of  other 
birds  is  much  less  common  than  has  been  asserted."  Never- 
theless, that  these  birds  raised  sad  havoc  in  my  garden 
while  they  lived  in  a  neighbouring  thicket,  I  know  by  sad 
experience,  and  I  personally  prefer  administering  poisonous 
beverages  to  the  various  insects  that  enjoy  garden  rambles, 
than  to  be  assisted  in  their  destruction  by  this  azure-plumed, 
jeering  bandit. 

Nor  does  the  fact  that  Jays  make  devoted  parents,  ex- 
cuse their  audacity.  The  Kobber  Barons  were  doubtless 
liberal  enough  inside  their  own  castles,  where  the  tribute 
from  other  homes  gave  the  baby  barons  the  wherewithal 
to  wax  fat  and  ferocious.  I  speak  from  the  view  point  of 
the  homekeeper  and  gardener  whose  first  thought  is  for 
the  Thrush,  the  Eobin,  the  Catbird,  and  all  other  friendly 
tenants  of  bush  and  hedge.

recommend  him,  the  Crow,  at  least  as  a  bird  of  the  garden, 
home  fields  and  woodlands,  has  not  a  single  good  mark  to 
his  name.  A  price  has  been  set  upon  his  head;  he  sees 
a  gun  a  mile  away,  while  his  only  picturesque  quality  is  a 
negative  one  —  when  he  completes  the  dreariness  of  a  No- 
vember landscape  by  flapping  dolefully  over  the  stacked 
cornstalks  in  the  brown  fields. 

From  the  standpoint  of  the  agricultural  economist,  how- 
ever, the  Crow  seems  to  be  pronounced  not  guilty,  or  at 
least  not  wholly  as  black  as  he  usually  appears  to  the  naked 
eye  of  the  casual  observer.  The  white  feathers  claimed  for 
him  are  the  May  beetles,  June  bugs,  grasshoppers,  cut- 
worms, caterpillars,  mice,  etc.,  that  he  consumes  in  off  sear- 
sons,  when  corn  is  too  hard  to  suit  him  and  nests  are  empty. 

Be  this  as  it  may,  we  must  be  allowed  to  regard  birds 
somewhat  in  an  aesthetic  light,  we  are  not  all  interested  in 
cataloguing  the  contents  of  birds'  stomachs,  and  no  one  Tvill 
deny  that  the  average  Crow  (of  course  there  may  be  abnor- 
mal and  angelic  exceptions)  is  a  coward,  with  a  hoarse  voice 
and  disagreeable  manners  added  to  a  most  offensive,  crouch- 
ing personality  hiding  a  world  of  cheap  craft.  In  fact,  a 
sort  of  feathered  Uriah  Heap,  whom  we  do  not  desire  for 
a  near  neighbour,  though  there  may  be  people  and  communi- 
ties where  he  is  appreciated. 

Fish  Crow:  Corvus  ossifragus. 

Length :  14-16  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Glossy,  purplish  black. 

Song :  Resembling  the  last  species,  but  with  a  different  intonation. 

Season :  Summer  resident. 

Breeds :  Through  range. 

Nest  and  Eggs:  Hardly  to  be  distinguished  from  those  of  the  last 

species. 
Bange :  Atlantic  coast,  from  Long  Island  to  Florida.

Horned  Lark  SONG-BIRDS. 

It  is  easy  to  confuse  this  Crow  with  the  ordinary  species, 
the  only  marks  of  identification  being  its  inferior  size  and 
different  call.  It  frequents  the  shore  chiefly,  and  may  be 
seen  here  on  its  arrival  in  early  spring,  before  the  Gulls 
have  left,  clamming  on  the  mud  flats  and  sand-bars  of  the 
creeks  that  run  into  Long  Island  Sound.  These  Crows  seem 
to  tread  for  the  long-necked  clams  as  people  do,  and  then 
dislodge  them  with  a  blow  from  their  strong  beaks,  break- 
ing the  shell  in  the  same  manner,  and  tearing  out  the  con- 
tents with  the  aid  of  their  claws.  In  winter  I  have  seen 
the  common  Crows  flock  to  the  beach  and  procure  shell-fish 
in  the  same  way.  The  Fish  Crow  is  said,  by  Audubon,  to 
catch  fish  like  the  Osprey,  and  flocks  were  seen  by  him  sail- 
ing through  the  air,  above  the  St.  John's  River,  Florida,  the 
aerial  excursion  lasting  for  hours,  after  which  the  Crows 
would  turn  their  attention  to  fishing  for  half  an  hour,  and 
then  alight  in  the  trees  to  plume  themselves. 

Horned  Liark:    Octocoris  alpestris. 

Shore  Lark, 


Length:  7-7.50  inches. 

Male :  Upper  parts  brown  with  a  pinkish  cast,  most  marked  on  neck 
and  rump.  Black  crescent  on  breast ;  black  bar  in  front  of 
head,  extending  to  side  of  head,  forming  two  tufts  or  horns  ; 
frontlet,  throat,  and  neck  pale  yellowish ;  below  whitish,  streaked 
with  black ;  bill  dark  ;  feet  black. 

Female :  Paler  and  somewhat  smaller. 

Song :  Only  a  call  note  here,  but  a  charming  song  in  the  breeding- 
haunts. 

Season :  Winter  resident  along  shore  ;  October  to  April. 

Breeds :  In  March  and  April  in  boreal  regions,  and  raises  two  broods 
a  season. 

Nest :  Of  grass,  in  ground  hollow. 

Eggs:  Variable,  greenish  white  or  gray,  heavily  marked  with  dark 
gray. 

Bange :  Northeastern  North  America,  Greenland,  and  northern  part 
of  the  Old  World  ;  in  winter  south  in  the  eastern  United  States 
to  the  Carolinas,  Illinois,  etc.

SONG-BIRDS.  Homed  Lark 

The  pinkish  gray  colouring  of  the  Horned  Lark  is  very 
beautiful,  but  in  the  Middle  and  Eastern  States  he  is  rarely 
seen  in  his  spring  garb,  and  his  winter  plumage  lacks  the 
vivid  contrasts  and  pure  colour. 

These  Larks,  if  the  snow  is  not  too  deep,  settle  in  the  marsh- 
meadows,  where  they  pick  up  a  living  from  various  seeds ; 
or,  if  the  snow  has  covered  the  fields,  they  take  refuge  in 
sheltered  spots  by  hayricks  and  even  near  houses.  I  have 
seen  them  quite  close  to  the  village,  picking  up  oats  under 
a  shed  where  straw  had  been  thrashed  recently.  According 
to  Audubon,  they  have,  in  the  breeding-range,  the  habit  of 
singing  as  they  soar  in  the  air,  after  the  manner  of  the 
European  Skylark.

That  the  Kingbird — the  second  largest  of  our  Flycatchers 
—  is  a  tyrant,  as  his  Latin  name  indicates,  no  one  will  doubt 
who  has  watched  his  tactics  for  a  single  day.  He  is  born  a 
fighter ;  he  fights  for  his  mate,  he  fights  to  protect  his  nest, 
and  when  he  cannot  find  an  opponent  he  emulates  Don 
Quixote.  His  greatest  tyranny  is  over  the  ravenous  insects 
that  he  holds  so  well  in  check ;  and  the  clumsy  Crows  and 
Hawks  he  drives  at  will.

KINGBIRD. 

Length,  8  inches. 


SONGLESS  BIRDS.  Kingbird 

Look  at  him  as  he  sits  motionless  on  the  top  wire  of  the 
fence,  resting  from  an  aerial  excursion.  He  is  easy  to  iden- 
tify, for  his  grays  and  blacks  are  so  distinct  and  the  clear 
white  tail  band  is  decisive.  Suddenly  he  dashes  into  the 
air  or  sweeps  above  the  ground  and  secures  an  insect  with 
a  sharp  snap  of  the  beak,  —  a  drone  bee,  perhaps,  although 
the  bees  that  he  captures  are  comparatively  few,  —  and  re- 
turns to  the  precise  spot  from  which  he  started.  This  is  a 
habit  peculiar  to  the  Flycatchers.  I  once  watched  a  King- 
bird for  nearly  two  hours,  his  point  of  vantage  being  a  rail 
and  wire  fence  between  low  meadows,  and,  though  he  would 
sail  mauy  hundred  yards  away,  he  always  returned  to  his 
original  perch.  If  a  Crow  or  Hawk  appears  ever  so  far  in  the 
distance,  he  gives  his  shrill  alarm  note  and  goes  in  instant 
pursuit ;  and  lucky  is  the  chicken  yard  that  has  a  pair  of  these 
gallant  knights  at  hand  and  the  garden  that  shelters  them. 

He  does  not  seem,  however,  to  care  to  cross  swords  with 
the  Catbird,  not,  perhaps,  that  he  is  absolutely  afraid,  but 
he  becomes  suddenly  near-sighted  when  that  cunning  musi- 
cian crosses  his  path.  Dr.  Abbott  once  tested  the  valour 
of  a  particularly  saucy  Kingbird,  by  sending  up  a  red  and 
yellow  bird  kite  in  the  vicinity  of  its  nest,  pulling  the  kite 
backward  as  the  bird  advanced  and  then  when  he  was  close 
upon  it  slackening  the  string  so  that  the  Kingbird,  unable 
to  check  itself,  plunged  through  the  paper  and  bolted  off, 
not  returning  for  many  hours,  doubtless  because  his  enemy 
was  intangible,  and  not  from  fear. 

Kingbirds  make  most  devoted  parents,  and  the  young 
birds  are  delightful  little  things  to  watch  as  they  develop 
if  you  are  as  fortunate  in  finding  a  nestful  as  was  Mrs. 
Olive  Thome  Miller,  who  has  recorded  their  ways  for  all 
bird-lovers  present  and  future  in  her  "  Chronicle  of  Three 
Little  Kings."  ^ 

Opinions  differ  as  to  the  Kingbird's  bee-destroying  pro- 
clivities, for  which  he  received  the  name  of  Bee  Martin; 
neighbouring  farmers  even  tell  different  stories,  —  one  hav- 
ing assured  me  that  last  year  his  hives  were  impoverished,

while  the  other,  an  equally  successful  apiarist,  says  that 
he  has  never  suffered  any  appreciable  loss  from  this  bird. 
They  are  said  to  take  only  drones. 

Crested  Flycatcher:    Myiarchus  crinitus. 

Length  :  8-9  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Head  feathers  forming  a  poirited  crest.  Above 
grayish  olive,  browner  on  wings  and  tail,  feathers  of  former 
with  light  edges.  Throat  gray,  below  sulphur-yellow,  which 
extends  beneath  wings.    Bill  darkj  thick,  and  rather  short. 

Note :  Harsh  call,  somewhat  like  the  Kingbird's. 

Season:  Summer  resident ;  May  to  September. 

Breeds :  Through  its  United  States  range. 

Nest:  In  hollow  trees  and  posts,  sometimes  in  abandoned  Wood- 
peckers' holes ;  made  of  varied  materials,  in  which  snake  skins 
are  often  found. 

Eggs:  Uniquely  marked,  ground  buff  or  clay-coloured,  marked  in 
various  ways  with  purple,  chestnut,  and  chocolate  brown. 

Bange :  Eastern  United  States  and  southern  Canada,  west  to  the 
Plains,  south,  in  winter,  through  eastern  Mexico  to  Costa  Rica. 

This  is  the  great  sulphur-bellied  Flycatcher,  who  lines  his 
nest  hollow  with  cast  away  snake  skins.  How  many  little 
boys,  as  well  as  people  of  larger  growth,  have  worked  their 
hands  into  the  hole  of  a  supposed  Woodpecker,  only  to  feel 
the  drying  skin  of  a  snake  twisted  up  inside,  and  have  fairly 
tumbled  to  the  ground,  lest  the  former  inhabitant  of  the 
skin  should  be  in  the  vicinity.  These  birds  do  not  nest  as 
freely  in  the  neighbourhood  as  the  Kingbird,  and,  though 
sufficiently  pugnacious  with  their  bird  kin,  keep  rather 
aloof  from  human  society,  so  that  their  habits  are  less 
familiar.  In  early  May  when  they  arrive,  they  feed  upon 
ground-beetles,  etc.,  but  later  in  the  season  frequent  the 
wooded  edges  of  lanes  and  old  pastures,  and  very  little 
insect  life  that  passes  by  escapes  their  snapping  gape. 

Burroughs,  in  speaking  of  the  Flycatchers  in  general, 
says  that  "The  wild  Irishman  of  them  all  is  the  Great- 
crested  Flycatcher,  a  large  leather-coloured  or  sandy  com- 
plexioned  bird,  that  prowls  through  the  woods,  uttering 
its  harsh,  uncanny  note,  and  waging  fierce  warfare  upon 
its  fellows."

Male  and  Female :  Above  deep  olive-brown ;  straight  black  bill. 
Outer  edges  of  some  tail  feathers  -whitish ;  an  erectile  crest. 
Beneath  dingy  yellowish  white  ;  feet  black. 

Note  :  "  Phcebee,  phoebee,  pewit,  phceb6e  !  " 

Season :  April  to  October.     Common  summer  resident. 

Breeds :  From  the  Carolinas  northward. 

Nest :  In  its  native  woods  the  nest  is  of  moss,  mud,  and  grass  brack- 
eted on  a  rock,  near  or  over  running  water ;  but  in  the  vicinity 
of  settlements  and  villages,  it  is  placed  on  a  horizontal  bridge 
beam,  timber  supporting  porch  or  shed. 

Eggs:  Pure  white,  somewhat  spotted. 

Mange :  Eastern  North  America,  from  the  British  Provinces  south  to 
eastern  Mexico  and  Cuba,  wintering  from  the  South  Atlantic 
and  Gulf  States  southward. 

The  cheerful  Phoebe,  the  first  to  come  and  the  last  to 
leave  of  its  tribe,  can  be  distinguished  by  its  sociability  as 
well  as  its  musical  cry.  To  those  who  are  familiar  with, 
the  domestic  Phcebe,  who  builds  his  bulky  moss  nest  at 
their  very  door,  and  who  associate  him  with  the  Wren  in 
his  love  of  nooks  in  the  outbuildings,  it  will  seem  strange 
to  know  that  in  his  primitive  state  he  haunts  dim  woods 
and  running  water.  The  domesticated  Phoebe  is  a  great 
bather,  and  may  be  seen  in  the  half-light  dashing  in  and 
out  of  the  water  as  he  makes  trips  to  and  from  his  nest. 

Here  in  the  garden  this  bird  frequently  exhibits  its  love 
of  water,  and  after  the  young  are  hatched  in  the  various 
nests,  both  old  and  young  repair  to  a  maple  near  the  pool, 
and  disport  themselves  about  the  water  until  moulting-time. 
It  is  very  amusing  to  watch  them  as  they  flash  down,  one 
by  one,  for  a  dip  or  an  insect,  taking  both  on  the  wing 
without  a  pause. 

Do  not  let  the  Phoebes  build  under  the  hoods  of  your  win- 
dows, for  their  spongy  nests  harbour  innumerable  bird-lice, 
and  under  such  circumstances  your  fly-screens  will  become 
infested  and  the  house  invaded.

Season :  In  migrations  ;  May  and  September. 

Breeds:  From  higher  and  mountainous  parts  of  the  United  States 
northward. 

Nest :  Made  of  small  twigs,  grass,  and  fibres ;  very  crude  and  shape- 
less ;  saddled  on  a  high  horizontal  branch. 

Eggs :  4-5,  buff- white,  spotted  thickly  with  reddish  brown. 

Bange:  North  America;  in  winter,  south  to  Central  America  and 
Colombia. 

The  Olive-sided  Flycatclier  is  an  irregular  migrant,  which 
is  sometimes  rarest  in  spring  and  sometimes  in  autumn.  I 
think,  however,  that  it  is  rather  plentiful  in  this  neighbour- 
hood in  early  September,  for  I  have  seen  it  repeatedly  with 
miscellaneous  flocks  of  Flycatchers  in  the  ranks  of  the  early 
returning  migrants.

larger  end. 
Bange:  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains,  and  from  southern 

Canada  southward.

SONGLESS  BIRDS.  Flycatchera 

In  early  May  the  Wood  Pewee  comes  to  the  garden  lane 
and  whispers  of  his  presence  with  his  plaintive  little  ditty, 
and  in  the  autumn  the  same  lonely  call  is  virtually  the 
only  wood  note  left.  In  spite  of  his  name,  he  is  not  exclu- 
sively a  wood-bird,  but  comes  through  the  garden,  follow- 
ing shyly  in  the  Phoebe's  wake.  But  he  only  trusts  his 
precious  nest  to  some  mossy  woodland  limb,  a  trifle  softened 
by  decay,  where  he  blends  his  house  with  its  foundations  by 
the  skilful  use  of  moss  and  lichens. 

Alert  and  swift  of  motion,  he  still  wears  an  air  of  mystery, 
and  his  pathetic  note  seems  like  the  expression  of  a  hidden 
sorrow.  Trowbridge's  poem  telling  of  his  woodland  search 
for  the  Pewee  is  one  of  the  most  charming  bird  epics  we 
have,  and  the  verse  describing  its  plumage  and  song  is  the 
bird's  life  history  told  in  a  few  lines,  — 


*♦  I  quit  the  search,  and  sat  me  down 
Beside  the  brook,  irresolute, 
And  watch  a  little  bird  in  suit 
Of  sombre  olive,  soft  and  brown. 

Perched  in  the  maple  branches,  mute ; 
With  greenish  gold  its  vest  was  fringed, 
Its  tiny  cap  was  ebon-tinged. 
With  ivory  pale  its  wings  were  barred, 
And  its  dark  eyes  were  tender  starred. 
' Dear  bird,'  I  said,  '  what  is  thy  name  ?  * 
And  thrice  the  mournful  answer  came, 
So  faint  and  far,  and  yet  so  near,  — 
*  Pewee !  pe-wee  I  peer !  * " 


Yellow-bellied  Flycatcher :    Empidonax  flaviventris.

to  the  breast.     Under  parts  pale  yellow,  including  wing  linings. 

Yellowish  eye  ring  and  two  yellowish  bars  on  wings.    Lower 

mandible  yellow  ;  feet  black.

Flycatchers  SONGLESS  BIRDS. 

Nest :  Close  to  the  earth  in  swampy  ground,  set  in  a  stump  or  up- 
turned root ;  constructed  of  mosses  and  thick- walled  and  bulky, 
like  the  Phoebe's. 

Eggs:  White,  spotted. 

Mange:  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains,  and  from  southern 
Labrador  south  through  eastern  Mexico  to  Panama. 

The  Yellow-bellied  Flycatcher  is  noted  as  a  rare  migrant 
in  this  vicinity ;  the  only  one  that  I  have  identified  with  cer- 
tainty in  the  spring  migration  was  killed  by  flying  against  a 
wire  trellis  in  the  garden,  but,  like  the  last  species,  they  are 
more  locally  abundant  in  autumn.  They  sometimes  breed  in 
northern  Pennsylvania,  in  tangled  thickets  near  streams. 

They  are  late  birds  in  the  spring,  and  do  not  arrive  in 
southern  New  England,  en  route  for  their  breeding-haunts, 
until  the  middle  of  May. 


Acadian  Flycatcher:  Einpidonax  acadicus. 


Length :  5.75-6.25  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  dull  olive-green.    Below  yellowish,  turning 

to  light  gray  on  throat  and  belly.     White  eye  ring.     Bill  brown 

above,  pale  below ;  feet  brown. 
Note :  "  Hick  up  !     Hick  up  !  " 
Season  :  Summer  resident,  May  to  September. 
Breeds :  From  Florida  to  southern  Connecticut  and  Manitoba. 
Nest :  Shallow  and  loosely  built,  near  the  end  of  a  slim  horizontal 

branch  ;  made  of  grass,  blossoms,  and  bark. 
Eggs :  Cream  white,  wreathed  at  the  larger  end. 
Mange :  Eastern  United  States,  chiefly  southward ;  west  to  the  Plains, 

south  to  Cuba  and  Costa  Rica. 

This  little  Flycatcher  has  a  southerly  range,  only  com- 
ing over  the  New  England  border  in  summer;  there  are 
but  two  breeding-records  of  it  in  Connecticut,  one  being 
Greenwich,  Conn.,  where  a  nest  and  young  were  found  in 
June,  1893.  It  is  a  common  resident  along  the  Hudson  as 
far  north  as  Sing  Sing,  and  Dr.  Warren  found  it  breeding 
freely  about  West  Chester,  Penn.,  where  he  says  the  majority

of  nests  were  made  entirely  of  blossoms,  being  rarely  more 
than  eight  or  ten  feet  from  the  ground,  and  so  open  at  the 
bottom  that  the  eggs  could  be  seen  from  underneath.  He 
also  says  that  it  is  a  common  resident  of  Pennsylvania  from 
May  until  late  September,  at  which  season  it  ekes  out  its 
insect  diet  with  berries. 

Its  nest  is  variously  described  as  "  a  light  hammock  swung 
between  forks,"  and  "  a  tuft  of  hay  caught  by  the  limb  from 
a  load  driven  under  it." 


Least  Flycatcher :    Empidonax  minimus* 

Length :  5-5.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female  :  Olive-gray,  brightest  on  the  head,  paler  on  wings 

and  rump.     Whitish  eye  ring,  and  wing-bars.    Breast  whitish, 

growing  more  yellow  toward  vent.    Bill  dusky.    Feet  black. 
Note:  "Che-becl  Chebec  !  "     (Coues.) 
Season  :  Common  summer  resident ;  May  to  late  September. 
Breeds :  From  Pennsylvania  northward. 
Nest :  In  upright  crotch  of  tree  or  bush,  substantial  and  well  cupped. 

Materials  varying  with  the  location,  plant  fibres  and  weeds, 

lined  with  down  and  sometimes  horsehair. 
Sggs :  Usually  unmarked,  occasionally  faintly  spotted. 
Bange :  Eastern  North  America,  south  in  winter  to  Central  America. 

The  least  of  his  tribe,  the  mite,  whose  olive  poll  is  seen 
in  great  numbers  darting  about  the  orchard  in  May  and 
again  in  late  September  when  the  decaying  fruit  attracts 
numerous  insects.  He  is  abundant,  useful,  and  sociable, 
though  neither  possessing  gay  feathers  nor  a  single  musical 
note,  yet  he  fills  his  own  corner,  doing  his  part  in  helping 
man  to  keep  the  upper  hand  over  the  insect  world.  These 
Flycatchers  are  solicitous  parents  and,  as  a  rule,  show  great 
affection  for  their  young,  becoming  almost  frantic  if  the 
nest  is  approached.

Plate  43. 

Length :  9-10  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  A  long- winged  bird  of  the  twilight  and  night. 
Large  mouth  fringed  with  bristles.  Plumage  dusky  and  Owl- 
like, much  spotted  with  black  and  gray.  Wings  beautifully 
mottled  with  shades  of  brown;  lower  half  of  the  outer  tail 
quills  white  in  the  male,  but  rusty  in  female. 

Note :  "  Whip-poor-will,  whip-poor-will ; "  repeated  usually  five  times 
in  succession,  followed  by  a  jarring  noise  during  flight. 

Season :  Late  April  to  September.  Common  summer  resident,  except 
near  the  shore. 

Breeds :  In  all  parts  of  its  range,  but  most  freely  toward  the  northern 
portions. 

Nest :  Builds  none,  but  substitutes  a  mossy  hollow  in  rock  or  ground. 

Uggs :  2,  creamy-white,  freely  marked,  and  spotted  with  brown. 

Range :  Eastern  United  States  to  the  Plains,  south  to  Guatemala. 

TMs  weird  bird,  with  its  bristling,  fly-trap  mouth,  who 
sleeps  all  day  and  prowls  by  night,  comes  to  us  late  in  April, 
if  the  season  is  warm,  clamouring  and  waking  strange  echoes 
in  the  bare  woods,  and  in  early  September,  mute  and  mys- 
terious, he  gathers  his  flocks  and  moves  silently  on,  for  the 
Whip-poor-will  has  not  at  any  time  even  a  transient  home 
to  abandon ;  like  the  pilgrims  of  old,  the  earth  is  his  only 
bed. 

This  bird  is  somewhat  erratic  in  its  local  distribution. 
It  is  noted  here  as  a  common  summer  resident,  yet  is  sel- 
dom heard  within  two  miles  of  the  beach,  except  in  the 
spring  migration,  and  I  have  never  but  once  found  it  in 
the  garden.  After  crossing  the  Greenfield  Hill  Ridge,  the 
numbers  increase,  and  in  the  wooded  hollow  below  Redding 
Ridge  they  are  so  numerous  as  to  make  the  early  night 
noisy.

SONGLESS  BIRDS.  Nighthawk 

Many  people  are  familiar  with,  the  cry  who  have  never 
seen  the  bird  itself;  for  Nature  has  taken  great  pains  to 
blend  the  colours  of  its  plumage  with  the  browns  and  grays 
of  the  bark  and  rocks  of  the  forest,  and  has  given  it  the 
unusual  habit  of  sitting  lengthwise  on  the  branch  when  it 
perches,  so  that  it  is  invisible  from  below,  and  so  closely 
resembles  the  branch  against  which  it  is  so  flattened  as  to 
escape  notice. 

The  Whip-poor-will  prefers  the  forest  solitude,  but  in  his 
nocturnal  flights  he  often  comes  near  houses,  and  sometimes 
calls  close  to  a  window  with  startling  vehemence. 

The  breeding-habits  of  this  strange  bird  are  not  the  least 
of  its  peculiarities ;  when  the  ground-laid  eggs  are  hatched, 
they  are  beset  by  many  dangers  from  weasels,  snakes,  etc., 
but  the  young  birds  are  almost  invisible  to  the  human  eye, 
even  if  their  location  is  known.  The  female  is  very  adroit, 
and  if  she  thinks  her  family  has  been  discovered  she  will 
move  them  to  another  place,  carrying  them  in  her  mouth  as 
a  cat  does  kittens.  In  fact,  the  Whip-poor-will  is  well  pro- 
tected both  by  nature  and  superstition ;  the  farmer  knows  its 
value  as  an  insect-destroyer,  and  the  idle  mischief-loving 
class,  who  kill  birds  from  pure  wantonness,  give  it  a  wide 
berth,  as  being  the  possessor  of  some  occult  power,  akin  to 
the  "  evil  eye,"  and  associate  its  sudden  cry  with  death  or 
calamity.

a  V-shaped  white  spot  on  throat.    Wings  brown  and  large,  white 

spot  extending  entirely  through  them,  being  conspicuous  inflight; 

white  bar  on  tail.    In  the  female,  the  white  markings  are  either 

veiled  with  rusty  or  absent. 
Note :  A  skirling  sound  while  on  the  wing,  — ''  Skirk  —  S-k-i-rk  ! "

Nlghthawk  SONGLESS  BIRDS. 

Nest :  A  ground  hollow  like  the  last  species. 
Uggs :  2,  of  variable  shades  of  gray  latticed  with  olive. 
Mange:  Northern  and  eastern  North  America,  east  of  the  Great 
Plains. 

Another  bird  of  tlie  twilight,  feeding  bat-like  upon  the 
insects  obtained  in  the  air.  It  is  most  conspicuous  in  the 
late  afternoon,  though  it  flies  also  by  day,  and  may  be 
distinguished  from  the  Whip-poor-will,  which  it  closely 
resembles,  by  the  large  ichite  wing  spots.  After  dark  its 
cry  will  easily  identify  the  Nighthawk,  for,  instead  of  the 
distinct  syllables  of  the  Whip-poor-will,  it  gives  a  peculiar 
harsh  whistling  note,  while  on  the  wing,  which  is  followed 
every  few  minutes  by  a  vibrating  sound,  as  if  a  fully  charged 
telegraph  wire  was  struck  with  a  bit  of  metal ;  or,  as  Nuttall 
describes  it,  "a  hollow  whirr,  like  the  rapid  turning  of  a 
spinning  wheel,  or  a  strong  blowing  into  the  bung-hole  of  an 
empty  hogshead,  which  is  supposed  to  be  produced  by  the 
action  of  air  in  the  open  mouth  of  the  bird."  In  the  latter 
conjecture  he  was  wrong,  as  the  jarring  sound,  which  gave 
the  bird  the  name  of  Night-jar,  is  now  conceded  to  come 
from  its  habit  of  dropping  suddenly  through  the  air,  thus 
making  a  sort  of  stringed  instrument  of  its  pinions. 

The  Nighthawk  has  the  Whip-poor-will's  habit  of  laying 
its  eggs  on  a  bare  surface,  only  it  chooses  open  fields  and 
waste  pastures,  or  even  flat  roofs  of  city  houses,  instead  of 
the  woods.  The  term  Hawk,  as  applied  to  it,  is  an  entire 
misnomer;  it  is  in  no  sense  a  bird  of  prey,  and  subsists 
entirely  on  insects,  and  the  stories  told  of  its  chicken-killing 
propensities  are  w^holly  unfounded.  In  early  autumn,  prior 
to  the  migration,  the  Nighthawks  gather  in  enormous  flocks 
and  fly  about  the  entire  afternoon,  when  they  may  be 
distinctly  seen.

Chimney  Swift :    Chwtura  pelagica. 

Chimney  Swallow, 

Plate  45. 
Length  .•  5.25  inches. 
Male  and  Female :  A  deep,  sooty  brown.    Wings  longer  than  the  tail, 

which  is  nearly  even,  the  shafts  of  the  quills  ending  in  sharp 

spines. 
Note :  A  loud,  Swallow-like  twitter. 
Season :  Late  April  to  September  and  October ;  a  common  summer 

resident. 
Breeds :  From  Florida  to  Labrador. 
Nest :  A  loose,  twig  lattice  glued  by  the  bird's  saliva,  or  sometimes 

tree-gum,  to  the  inside  of  chimneys  ;  or  in  wild  regions  to  the 

inner  walls  of  hollow  trees. 
Eggs :  4-5,  pure  white,  and  long  for  their  width. 
Mange:  Eastern  North  America,  north  to  Labrador  and  the  Fur 

Countries,  west  to  the  Plains,  and  passing  south  of  the  United 

States  in  winter. 

This  bird,  popularly  known  as  the  CMmney  Swallow,  but 
which,  is  more  closely  related  to  the  Nighthawk,  may  be 
easily  distinguished  from  the  Swallows  when  flying,  by  its 
short,  blunt  tail.  You  will  never  see  it  perching  as  Swallows 
do ;  for,  except  when  it  is  at  rest  in  its  chimney  home,  it  is 
constantly  on  the  wing,  either  darting  through  the  air,  drop- 
ping surely  to  its  nest,  or  speeding  from  it  like  a  rocket. 
The  Chimney  Swift  secures  its  food  wholly  when  flying,  and 
is  more  active  at  night  than  in  the  day.  In  the  breeding- 
season  its  busiest  time  is  that  preceding  dawn,  and  it  then 
works  without  cessation  for  many  hours.  The  whirling  of 
the  wings  as  the  bird  leaves  the  chimney  makes  a  noise  like 
distant  thunder,  and  if  there  is  quite  a  colony  the  inhabi- 
tants of  the  house  may  be  seriously  disturbed,  and  the  pres- 
ence of  the  nests  often  introduces  bedbugs,  as  they  are  to 
a  certain  extent  parasites  of  these  birds.  This  makes  him 
an  undesirable  tenant,  and  in  modern  houses,  where  the  flues 
are  narrow  and  easily  clogged,  wire  is  stretched  over  the 
chimney  mouth  to  keep  him  out.

Hummingbird  SONGLESS  BIRDS. 

Nothing,  however,  is  more  picturesque  than  these  Swifts 
as  they  circle  above  the  wide  stone  chimney  of  some  haK- 
ruined  house,  where  the  garden  is  overgrown  by  old  lilacs^ 
and  great  banks  of  the  fragrant  bushes  hide  the  crumbling 
walls.  I  know  of  such  a  place,  only  a  few  miles  away, 
where  the  Swifts  curve  and  eddy  above  the  huge  chimney, 
bent  with  the  weight  of  years,  in  such  perfect  accord  and 
rhythm,  now  wholly  disappearing  within,  now  curling  forth 
in  a  cloud,  that  it  is  easy  to  imagine  the  fire  burns  again 
upon  the  hearth  and  that  the  birds  are  but  the  columns 
of  hospitable  smoke. 

In  wild  districts  the  Swift  retains  the  habit  of  nesting  in 
hollow  trees,  the  custom  it  must  have  followed  until  com- 
paratively recent  times  in  this  country,  as  the  Indians  never 
possessed  even  the  ghost  of  a  chimney.  These  trees  are 
used  after  the  breeding-season  as  roosts,  and  there  is  evi- 
dence that  the  birds  may  sometimes  winter  in  them  in  a 
state  of  hibernation.  In  building  its  nest  the  Swift  snaps 
little  twigs  from  the  trees,  and  in  fixing  them  in  place 
braces  itself  in  the  chimney  by  means  of  its  claws  and  the 
sharp  spines  in  which  its  tail  feathers  terminate.  Its  size  is 
nearly  the  same  as  the  Bank  Swallow  and  the  two  flock 
prior  to  the  autumn  migration  at  about  the  same  time,  the 
Chimney  Swift  being  the  last  to  leave.

Bange:  Eastern  North  America  to  the  Plains,  north  to  the  Fur 
Countries,  and  south,  in  winter,  to  Cuba  and  Veragua. 

This  is  the  only  native  Hummingbird  of  eastern  North 
America,  and  it  is  impossible  to  confuse  it  with  any  other 
bird  in  its  range. 

When  the  late  tulips  and  narcissi  are  blooming  in  the 
garden,  and  you  hear  a  tense  humming  near  them,  varied 
by  an  occasional  squeak,  you  know,  without  looking,  that 
the  Hummingbirds  have  come.  All  through  late  May  they 
dart  here  and  there,  now  among  the  flowers,  and  then  disap- 
pearing high  up  in  the  trees,  searching  for  both  honey  and 
aphides  with  their  proboscis-like  tongues,  while  their  move- 
ments exceed  in  dash  and  rapidity  even  the  Swallows  and 
Swifts.  They  seem  merely  to  will  to  be  in  a  certain  spot, 
and  they  are  there  without  effort. 

With  June  they  settle  in  or  near  the  garden,  where 
the  roses  and  honeysuckle  supply  them  with  nectar  and 
ambrosia,  and  this  is  the  season  to  study  them.  Late  after- 
noon, between  six  and  seven  o'clock,  is  the  best  hour,  for 
they  are  taking  their  supper,  and  the  sun  being  low  behind 
the  trellis  its  rays  shoot  sidewise  and  bring  out  all  the 
metallic  splendour  of  their  plumage.  The  adult  birds  seldom 
perch,  but,  drawing  up  their  tiny  claws,  pause  in  front  of 
the  chosen  flower,  apparently  motionless.  But  the  hum 
of  the  wings  tells  the  secret  of  the  poise. 

The  parents  jam  their  bills  far  down  into  the  little  gap- 
ing mouths,  placing  the  food  in  the  throat  itself,  —  an 
effective  but  barbarous  looking  operation. 

The  nest  is  worthy  of  the  bird,  but  is  rare  in  comparison 
with  the  number  of  birds  that  are  seen  every  year.  There 
are  two  reasons  for  this;  it  blends  so  perfectly  with  the 
supporting  branch  as  to  be  invisible  when  the  leaves  are  on 
the  trees,  and  owing  to  its  spongy  composition,  it  seldom 
retains  its  shape  for  any  length  of  time. 

Various  nesting-sites  are  chosen,  and  in  the  garden  I  have 
found  them,  in  different  seasons,  on  a  horizontal  cedar  bough, 
a  slanting  beech  branch,  a  sweeping  elm  branch  over  th^

road,  and  one,  which  I  discovered  from  a  tower  window,  on 
the  topmost  branch  of  a  spruce  some  sixty  feet  from  the 
ground.  In  this  last  case  the  nest  was  covered  with  small 
flakes  of  spruce  bark,  instead  of  the  usual  lichens. 

After  the  nesting  the  males  make  themselves  exceedingly- 
scarce,  while  the  females  and  young  haunt  the  garden, 
feeding  in  flocks,  the  young  being  distinguishable  by  their 
dulness  of  plumage  and  the  fact  that  they  perch  frequently. 
All  through  August  and  early  September,  before  cooling 
nights  warn  them  away,  they  dart  through  the  mellow  haze 
claiming  the  last  Jacque  roses  and  the  blossoms  that  con- 
tinue to  wreathe  the  honeysuckle,  only  leaving  them  when 
the  twilight  chill  stiffens  their  feathered  mechanism. 

When  the  mild  gold  stars  flower  out, 

As  the  summer  gloaming  goes, 
A  dim  shape  quivers  about 

Some  sweet  rich  heart  of  a  rose.

SONGLESS  BIRDS.  Woodpeckers

Bange:  Middle  portion  of  the  eastern  United  States  from  the  Atlan* 
tic  coast  to  the  Great  Plains. 

The  Hairy  Woodpecker  is  a  common  bird  in  wooded 
regions,  especially  where  partly  decayed  trees  have  been 
left  standing.  Its  creeping  motion  when  scanning  tree 
trunks  for  insects  resembles  that  of  the  Black-and-white 
Warbler.  Though  it  is  abundant,  it  is  shy  in  the  breeding- 
season  and  keeps  to  secluded  woodlands,  but  in  the  fall  and 
winter  comes  freely  to  orchards  and  about  houses.  It  has 
an  affection  for  particular  trees  and  often  uses  the  same 
tree,  if  not  perhaps  the  same  hole,  for  several  successive 
seasons. 

Eight  years  ago  I  noticed  this  species  in  May  in  Samp- 
Mortar  woods,  a  wild,  rocky  place,  covered  with  laurel  and 
abounding  in  the  rarer  ferns.  From  the  crest  of  Mortar 
Kock  I  could  look  into  the  top  of  a  tall  hickory,  in  which  a 
Hairy  Woodpecker  was  boring.  A  few  years  later,  at  the 
same  season,  I  found  a  similar  bird  nesting  in  the  same 
tree  and  there  were  three  holes  visible  in  the  trunk.  This 
year  I  went  to  the  place  early  in  June.  The  tree  was 
entirely  dead  and  branchless  from  winter  storms,  the  top 
had  crumbled  away  so  that  light  came  through  the  upper 
holes,  there  were  five  apertures  in  all,  and  from  the  lowest 
of  these  flew  a  Hairy  Woodpecker,  and  when  I  beat  on  the 
tree  with  a  stick  the  clamouring  inside  told  that  the  young 
were  hatched. 

On  seeing  me  the  bird  went  into  one  of  the  empty  holes 
and  then  flew  to  a  little  distance  and,  joined  by  the  male, 
refused  to  go  near  the  nest  while  I  remained.  The  tree  was 
so  shaky  that  it  swayed  with  every  breeze,  and  it  is  the  last 
year  that  it  will  shelter  its  black-and-white  tenants.  The 
red  head  band  is  not  very  conspicuous  in  this  Woodpecker 
unless  you  look  at  it  from  above  or  catch  a  glimpse  of  it 
when  the  bird  is  going  up  the  tree  trunk.

is  replaced  by  a  white  stripe  in  the  female. 
Note :  A  short,  sharp  note  and  a  rattling  cry,  which  starts  and  ends 

in  an  abrupt  precision,  suggestive  of  a  mechanical  contrivance 

set  off  with  a  spring.    This  it  uses  in  lieu  of  a  song.    (Bicknell.) 
Season  :  An  abundant  resident. 
Breeds :  Through  range. 

Nest :  In  tree  hole,  varying  from  low  apple  to  high  forest  trees.

The  Downy  WoodpeckePj  the  persistent  apple-tree  borer, 
is  a  miniature  reproduction  of  the  Hairy  Woodpecker,  except 
that  its  tail  is  barred  with  black  and  white.  This  is  the 
little  bird  that  ornaments  the  fruit  trees  with  symmetrical 
rows  of  holes,  such  as  would  be  made  by  small  shot.  He 
does  not,  however,  drain  the  vitality  of  the  tree,  as  many 
suppose,  by  taking  the  sap,  but  merely  bores  for  insects 
that  lie  between  the  bark  and  the  tissue.  In  fact,  the  opera- 
tion seems  to  be  beneficial,  perhaps  acts  as  a  system  of 
ventilation,  for  I  have  seen  some  very  fine  old  trees  where 
the  holes  were  so  numerous  as  to  form  strange  hiero- 
glyphics upon  every  limb.  This  Woodpecker  is  much  more 
sociable  than  his  big  brother,  and  is  present,  about  the 
orchards  and  gardens,  the  entire  year.

RED-HEADED    WOODPECKER. 

Length,  8.50-9.50  inches. 


SONGLESS  BIRDS.  Woodpeckers 

Note :  A  rapid  drumming  with  the  bill  on  the  tree  branch  or  trunk 

serves  for  a  love-song,  and  it  has  a  screaming  call  note. 
Season :  In  migrations  ;  more  abundant  in  fall  than  in  spring. 
Breeds  :  North  from  Massachusetts. 

Nest :  In  an  unlined  hole,  which  is  often  18  or  20  inches  deep. 
Eggs:  5,  pure  white. 

The  Sapsucker  is  a  superbly  marked  Woodpecker,  but  its 
beauty  is  neutralized  by  its  pernicious  habit  of  boring  holes 
in  the  tree  bark  through  which  it  siphons  the  sap  or  eats 
the  soft,  inner  bark. 

In  some  localities  they  will  destroy  large  tracts  of  fruit 
trees  by  stripping  off  the  entire  outer  bark.  Here,  in  the 
garden,  they  attacked  a  large  spruce  one  autumn,  and  the 
next  spring  the  trunk  was  white  with  the  sap  that  leaked 
from  the  hundreds  of  "  taps,"  and  the  tree  has  never  since 
recovered  its  vitality. 

Where  these  birds  are  plentiful,  many  orchard  owners 
cover  the  tree  trunks  with  fine  wire  netting,  and  it  would 
almost  seem  that  the  destruction  of  this  species  is  justi- 
fiable, but  care  should  be  taken  not  to  confuse  the  other 
innocent  Woodpeckers  with  this  red-crowned,  red-throated 
evil-doer.  Only  having  seen  the  bird  in  its  migrations,  I 
have  never  heard  the  wonderfully  rapid  drumming  to  which 
Mr.  Bicknell  refers,  and  which  he  says  does  not  occur  until 
the  birds  mate  and  is  never  heard  in  the  autumn.  This 
tattoo,  beat  upon  a  tree  with  the  beak,  is,  in  fact,  the  love 
note  of  the  majority  of  Woodpeckers. 

Red-headed  Woodpecker :  Melanerpes  erthrocephalus. 

Tricolour. 

Plate  48. 
Length :  8.50-9.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Head,  throat,  and  neck  crimson.    Back,  wings, 
and  tail  blue-black.     White  below.     White  band  on  wings,  and 
white  rump.     Bill  horn-coloured,  and  about  as  long  as  head. 
Note :  A  guttural  rattle,  similar  to  the  cry  of  the  tree-toad.     In  April 
a  hoarse,  hollow-sounding  cry.     (Bicknell.)

"Woodpeckera  SONGLESS  BIRDS. 

Season :  A  casual  resident,  and  an  abundant  but  irregular  migrant, 
especially  in  the  fall. 

Breeds :  From  Florida  to  northern  New  York  and  Manitoba. 

Nest :  Usually  a  hole  near  the  top  of  a  blasted  tree  in  mixed  woods. 

Eggs :  Glassy  white. 

Bange :  United  States  west  to  the  Kocky  Mountains,  straggling  west- 
ward to  Salt  Lake  Valley ;  rare  or  local  east  of  the  Hudson 
River. 

TMs  Woodpecker  was  once  a  regular  summer  resident 
here,  but  has  decreased  greatly  in  numbers  and  has  almost 
come  to  be  considered  as  a  migrant  only,  and  even  then 
it  will  be  fairly  abundant  in  one  season  and  absent  the  next. 
He  is  an  unmistakable  bird,  when  you  are  lucky  enough  to 
see  him,  for  he  boldly  wears  the  German  flag  in  his  red, 
white,  and  black  feathers,  and  you  will  recognize  him  at  a 
glance.  His  increasing  rarity  is  the  usual  penalty  paid  by 
highly  coloured  birds  to  thoughtless  gunners,  and  he  is  a  very 
easy  mark  when  he  is  feeding  flat  against  a  tree  trunk. 


Flicker:    Colaptes  auratus, 

Goldenrwinged  Woodpecker;   Tellowhammer,  Highhole,  Clape, 

Plate  49, 

Length :  12-13  inches. 

Male :  Above  golden  brown,  barred  with  black.  Black  crescent  on 
breast,  red  band  on  back  of  head.  Round  black  spots  on  the 
belly,  black  cheek  patch.  Wing  linings  and  shafts  of  wing  and 
tail  quills  gamboge-yellow.  Bump  white.  Bill  slender,  curv- 
ing, and  pointed,  and  dark  lead-colour ;  feet  lead-colour. 

Female :  Lacks  black  cheek  patches. 

Note:  *' Wick-wick-wick- wick!"  Also  a  few  guttural  notes.  "A 
prolonged,  jovial  laugh."     (Audubon.) 

Season :  Resident,  but  most  plentiful  from  April  to  October. 

Breeds :  Through  its  range. 

Nest :  In  partly  decayed  trees  in  orchard,  garden,  or  wood. 

Uggs :  Usually  6,  white. 

Bange:  Northern  and  eastern  North  America,  west  to  the  eastern 
slope  of  the  Rocky  Mountains  and  Alaska.  Occasional  on  the 
Pacific  slope  from  California  northward.  Accidental  in  Europe.

FLICKER. 

Length,  12-13  inches. 


SONGLESS  BIRDS.  Woodpeckers 

This,  tlie  largest  as  well  as  most  abundant  of  our  common 
Woodpeckers,  can  be  easily  identified,  when  at  rest,  by  the 
black  throat  crescent  and  red  head  patch,  and  when  flying 
by  the  white  rump  and  golden  wing  linings.  The  Golden- 
winged  is  a  Woodpecker  of  many  aliases,  among  which 
Pigeon-woodpecker,  Yucker,  and  Yellowhammer  are  locally 
familiar.  Individuals  remain  all  the  year,  and  frequent 
orchards  and  wooded  gardens  more  than  deep  woodlands; 
they  walk  about  on  the  ground  in  search  of  food  in  the  man- 
ner of  Pigeons,  and  are  in  this  respect  quite  independent  of 
trees. 

The  Flicker  is  a  genial,  sociable  bird,  and  its  hammering 
is  one  of  the  first  bird  sounds  of  early  spring  that  comes 
from  the  orchard.  In  April  or  May  it  looks  for  a  suitable 
bree  to  bore,  or  else  clears  out  a  last  year's  hole.  The  birds 
are  very  wary  when  the  excavation  is  under  way,  and, 
instead  of  dropping  the  chips  by  the  tree  where  they  are 
working,  carry  them  to  some  distance.  There  is  a  singu- 
lar physiological  fact  connected  with  the  laying  powers 
of  this  Woodpecker.  Six  is  the  usual  setting  of  eggs,  but  if 
the  eggs  are  removed  from  the  nest  as  soon  as  laid  the  female 
continues  laying  uninterruptedly,  and  according  to  Dr.  Coues 
eighteen  to  twenty-three  eggs  have  been  taken  from  one 
nest. 

When  the  young  are  hatched  the  parents  redouble  their 
attention,  and  resent  any  approach  to  the  hole.  They  feed 
their  young  by  the  process  known  as  regurgitation,  conveying 
the  partly  softened  food  from  their  own  crops  to  those  of  the 
young  by  w?i-swallowing  it  and  placing  their  slender  beaks  in 
the  mouths  of  the  nestlings.  A  tap  on  the  tree  at  this  time 
will  set  the  youngsters  clamouring  and  the  old  birds  fly  out 
in  alarm.  On  leaving  the  hole  the  young  are  at  first  very 
awkward  and  are  unable  to  fly  but  a  few  feet  from  the 
ground,  and  are  easily  caught  in  the  hand;  nor  do  they 
seem  to  develop  strength  of  wing  for  several  days. 

In  autumn  both  old  and  young  gather  in  considerable 
numbers  in  the  pastures  and  feed  upon  the  ground,  looking 
in  the  distance  like  Meadowlarks.

FAMILY    CUCULIDtE:    CUCKOOS. 
Yellow-billed  Cuckoo:   Coccyzus  americanus. 

Plate  60. 

Length :  11-12  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Powerful  beak,  about  as  long  as  head  ;  lower 
mandible  yellow ;  above  olive  with  gray  and  metallic  tints ; 
two  middle  tail  feathers  olive ;  outer  quills  black,  with  white 
spots  ;  wings  washed  with  bright  cinnamon  ;  under  parts  gray- 
ish white. 

Note  :  "  Kuk-kuk-kuk  !  "  a  harsh,  grating  sound. 

Season  :  Late  April  to  September. 

Breeds  :  From  Florida  to  New  Brunswick. 

Nest :  Rudimentary  ;  only  a  few  sticks  laid  in  a  bush  or  on  a  forked 
bough. 

Eggs  :  4-8,  pale  green,  sometimes  little  more  than  a  greenish  white. 

Mange:  Temperate  North  America,  from  New  Brunswick,  Canada, 
Minnesota,  Nevada,  and  Oregon  south  to  Costa  Rica  and  the 
West  Indies.  Less  common  from  the  eastern  border  of  the 
Plains  westward. 

Of  similar  general  appearance  to  the  next  species,  this 
Cuckoo  may  be  identified  by  the  following  marks:  yellow 
bill,  bright  cinnamon  wings,  and  white  S2:)0ts  on  the  long  tail 
feathers  which  are  very  conspicuous  in  flight.  A  few  years 
ago  the  Yellow-billed  Cuckoo  was  not  a  common  bird  here ; 
but  it  seemed  to  follow  the  recent  epidemic  of  tent- worms 
into  Connecticut,  and  for  the  past  two  seasons  has  been 
abundant  in  orchards  and  gardens  containing  fruit  trees, 
forgetting  its  shyness,  and  coming  close  to  dwellings.  Its 
hatred  of  the  tent-worm  is  intense,  for  it  destroys  many 
more  than  it  can  eat,  by  tearing  the  webs  apart,  and  squeez- 
ing the  worms  in  its  beak.  So  thoroughly  has  it  done  its 
work,  that  orchards,  which  three  years  ago  were  almost 
leafless,  the  trunks  even  being  covered  by  slippery  web- 
bing, are  again  yielding  a  good  crop.

SONGLESS  BIRDS.  Cuckoos 

Audubon  gives  this  bird  a  bad  character,  saying :  "  It  robs 
smaller  birds  of  their  eggs,  which  it  sucks  upon  all  occa^ 
sions,  and  is  cowardly  without  being  vigilant.  On  this  ac- 
count, it  falls  a  prey  to  several  species  of  Hawks,  of  which 
the  Pigeon-hawk  may  be  considered  its  most  dangerous 
enemy," 

Be  this  as  it  may,  both  of  our  Cuckoos  are  respectable 
examples  to  their  romantic  but  misguided  European  rela- 
tive, for,  like  it,  they  lay  their  eggs  at  long  intervals ;  but 
they  still  manage  to  scramble  a  nest  together  and  rear  their 
own  young,  though  they  have  to  face  the  responsibility  of 
feeding  nestlings,  incubating,  and  laying  more  eggs,  all  at 
the  same  time.  So  let  us  forgive  the  Cuckoo  its  faults, 
and  declare  it  the  patron  bird  of  the  orchards  and  of  over- 
crowded nurseries. 


Black-billed  Cuckoo:  Coccyzus  erythrophthalmus* 

Rain  Crow. 


Length :  11-12  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Black  bill ;  eyelids  red.  Above,  general  colouring 
same  as  last  species.  White  spots  on  tail,  small  and  incon- 
spicuous. 

Note :  "  Kow-kow-kow  !  kuk-kuk  1 " 

Season  :  May  to  late  September. 

Breeds :  Through  North  American  range. 

Nest :  In  a  bush  ;  a  few  sticks,  with  no  edge  to  confine  the  eggs. 

Eggs :  Hardly  distinguishable  from  the  last  species. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America,  from  Labrador  and  Manitoba  south 
to  the  West  Indies  and  the  valley  of  the  Amazon ;  west  to  the 
Rocky  Mountains.    Accidental  in  the  British  Islands  and  Italy. 

It  seems  a  slur  upon  literary  tradition  to  call  our  birds, 
which  bear  the  name.  Cuckoos.  We  are  so  used  to  associate 
the  word  with  the  merry  wanderer  that  "  sings  as  it  flies  " 
of  Chaucer  and  Shakespeare  and  all  the  lesser  singers  since 
their  day.  And  every  child,  in  thinking  of  a  Cuckoo, 
expects  to  find  the  twin  of  the  irrepressible  little  foreigner

who  bobs  out  of  tlie  clock,  and  will  insist  upon  calling 
mother's  attention  to  the  fact  that  it  is  bedtime. 

The  Black-billed  Cuckoo  is  locally  less  common  than  the 
Yellow-billed,  though  both  species  are  well  represented.  It 
is  often  called  the  Eain  Crow,  because  of  its  habit  of  calling 
loudly  in  damp  or  cloudy  weather.  It  haunts  streams  with 
lightly  wooded  banks,  and  sets  its  rickety  nest  in  a  briary 
tangle  or  thick  shrubbery.  In  spring  it  associates  in  the 
orchards  with  the  Yellow-billed,  but  at  other  seasons  its 
food  is  quite  different,  and  it  lives  upon  fresh-water  mol- 
lusks  and  the  larvse  always  to  be  found  in  numbers  near 
ponds.

appearing  large  for  size  of  body.     Above  lead-blue,  somewhat 

variegated  with  black.    Below  whitish.    Two  dull  blue  bands 

across  breast.     White  transverse  bands  and  spots  on  the  short 

tail.    Female  has  rusty  bands  across  breast. 
Note :  A  harsh,  rattling  cry,  as  familiar  along  river  banks  as  the  Jay's 

scream  in  the  woods. 
/Season :  A  common  summer  resident,  which  might  almost  be  classed 

as  a  resident,  as  it  comes  in  March,  and  in  mild  seasons  often 

winters. 
Breeds :  From  Florida  to  Labrador. 

Nest :  In  hollow  trees  and  in  earth  burrows  ;  6-8  feet  deep. 
Eggs :  6-8,  crystal  white. 
Bange :  North  America,  south  to  Panama  and  the  West  Indies. 

The  Kingfisher  may  be  easily  named,  as  he  sits  on  his 
usual  perch,  a  dead  stump  or  limb  jutting  over  the  water, 
by  his  large,  long-crested  head,  which  gives  his  body  a  bob- 
tailed  appearance.  Living  entirely  upon  fish,  he  is  driven 
from  small  streams  to  the  larger  rivers  by  the  closing  in  of 
the  ice,  but  in  open  winters  I  have  ^seen  this  bird  in  every 
month  from  November  to  March.

SONGLESS  BIRDS.  Kingfisher 

The  Kingfisher  seizes  his  prey  by  diving,  and  if  it  is 
small  and  pliable  swallows  it  at  once,  but  if  it  consists  of  the 
larger  and  more  spiney  fish  they  are  beaten  to  pulp  against 
a  branch  before  they  are  swallowed,  and  even  then  the 
struggles  and  contortions  the  bird  goes  through  before 
finally  mastering  the  fish,  would  be  very  ludicrous  were 
they  not  so  evidently  distressing. 

The  term  halcyon  days  (days  of  fair  weather)  is  derived 
from  this  bird's  Latin  name.  The  Kingfisher  was  once 
supposed  to  build  his  nest  on  a  little  raft  and  float  out  to 
sea  with  it,  having  the  power  of  averting  storms  during  the 
period  of  incubation.  The  modern  Kingfisher  is  too  wise  to 
try  any  such  experiment;  he  well  knows  that  no  one  can 
fathom  our  climate  or  restrain  Apollos  from  watering  at 
unseemly  times,  so  he  digs  deep  into  a  bank,  road  cut,  or 
quarry  and  the  precious  eggs  are  laid  many  feet  from  the 
outer  air. 

What  a  racket  the  old  birds  make  in  the  breeding-season ! 
There  may  be  loving,  harmonious  Kingfisher  households, 
but  if  so  these  sounds  belie  them.  But  who  can  say  how- 
ever ;  the  seemingly  angry  shrieks  of  both  parents  may  be 
"  Rock-a-Bye,  Baby,"  arranged  by  a  Kingfisher  Wagner  as  a 
duet!

American  Barn    Owl:    Strix  pratincola* 


Length :  15-17  inches.     Female  the  largest,  as  is  usual  with  Owls. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  tawny  yellow,  ash,  and  white,  with  black 
and  white  spots  ;  below  whitish  specked  with  dark.  Dark  bars 
on  tail  and  wing.  Legs  long  and  feathered.  Face  disks  heart' 
shaped,  eyes  small  and  bluish  black,  bill  light ;  no  horns. 

Note :  A  quavering  cry, —  "  Kr-r-r-r-r-r-ik ! " 

Season  :  Rare  resident ;  has  been  taken  at  Stratford,  Hartford,  Madi- 
son, and  Sachem's  Head,  Conn. 

Breeds :  Through  its  range,  in  late  February  and  March. 

Nest :  In  wild  regions  in  tree  trunks,  but  when  near  villages  in  bams, 
towers,  and  belfries. 

Eggs :  3-6,  dirty  white. 

Hange:  Warmer  parts  of  North  America,  from  the  Middle  States, 
Ohio  Valley,  and  California  southward  through  Mexico. 

The  Barn  Owl,  having  a  rather  southerly  range,  is  one  of 
the  rarest  Owls  to  be  found  in  New  England,  its  records 
are  limited  to  Connecticut  and  Massachusetts  and  there 
is  a  recent  one  for  Vermont.  In  New  York  State  and  Penn- 
sylvania it  is  more  common,  and  breeds  in  the  southern 
portion  of  these  states.  Its  appearance  is  so  unique  that  it 
is  sure  to  attract  attention,  and  it  is  not  amiss  to  mention 
it  in  connection  with  our  common  resident  Owls.  The  face 
looks  like  that  of  a  toothless,  hooked-nosed  old  woman, 
shrouded  in  a  closely  fitting  hood,  and  has  a  half-simple,

In  fact,  it  is  a  harmless  bird,  feeding  on  mice,  moles,  large

stumps. 

Eggs :  4-6,  the  usual  soiled  white. 

Bange :  Temperate  North  America. 

The  Long-eared  Owl,  or  Cat  Owl  (so  called  from  its  mew- 
ing cry  and  round  face),  has  conspicuous  ear  tufts,  as  long, 
for  the  size  of  the  bird,  as  those  of  the  Great  Horned  Owl. 
These  Owls  frequent  the  same  lowlands  as  the  Short-eared 
species ;  they  are  very  abundant  in  early  winter,  both  along 
the  marsh  borders  and  in  the  woods  by  the  river.  Dur- 
ing December,  1889,  they  were  so  common  that  several  were 
killed  by  boys  with  stones,  and  I  have  frequently  seen 
them  among  the  evergreens  in  the  garden.  This  species

it  was  meditating  a  practical  joke  of  a  particularly  aggra-

Short-eared  Owl:  Asia  accipitrinus. 

Length:  13.75-17  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Inconspicuous  ear  tufts,  facial  disk  with  a  dark 
ring  enclosed  in  a  lighter  one.  Plumage  varied  from  bright 
orange  to  bufEy  white,  with  bold  stripes  of  dark  brown,  darker 
above  and  more  mottled  below,  growing  whiter  toward  vent. 
Legs  feathered  with  plain  buff.  Bill  and  claws  dusky  blue- 
black. 

Note :  A  quaver. 

Season  :  Summer  resident  remaining  until  late  fall. 

Breeds :  Through  its  range. 

Nest :  Of  hay  and  sticks ;  commonly  on  the  ground  in  a  little  hollow 
or  clump  of  bushes. 

Fggs :  4-7,  dirty  white. 

Bange :  Throughout  North  America,  nearly  cosmopolitan. 


A  very  useful  Owl,  feeding  on  small  mammals,  reptiles, 
etc. ;  seen  here  in  considerable  numbers  in  the  marsh  meadows 
in  the  fall  and  early  winter,  possibly  being  resident.  It  is 
a  day  oivl,  and  can  be  seen  even  in  sunny  weather,  prowling 
about  in  the  long,  withered  marsh-grass. 

Mr.  L.  M.  Turner,  the  Arctic  explorer,  says  that  among  the 
natives  of  the  Yukon  district  (Alaska)  the  dried  liver  of 
this  owl,  ground  to  a  powder  and  administered  in  food,  is 
used  as  a  love  philter. 

Nuttall  describes  the  Short-eared  Owl  as  being  so  fierce 
that  it  will  sometimes  attack  men  seated  by  midnight  camp- 
fires.  This  seems  very  dubious,  as  even  the  powerful  Great 
Horned  Owl  rarely  attacks  man,  unless  he  is  cornered  or 
attacked  first.  It  is  more  probable  that  at  some  time  the 
Owl,  bewildered  by  smoke  and  flames,  unwittingly  flopped 
into  an  encampment,  and,  when  seized,  fought  for  liberty.

Season:  Resident. 
Breeds :  Through  range. 

Nest :  In  hollow  tree  or  in  crotch  at  some  height  from  the  ground. 
Eggs :  4-6,  laid  in  February,  March,  and  April. 
Bange:  Eastern  United  States  west  to  Minnesota  and  Texas,  north 

to  Nova  Scotia  and  Quebec. 

The  smooth-faced,  twilight  Owl  of  open  woods,  sheltered 
farms,  and  waysides.  Its  hooting  cry  is  hardly  to  be  dis- 
tinguished from  that  of  the  Great  Horned  Owl,  but  it  has 
several  mocking  and  quavering  notes  peculiar  to  itself. 

Its  eyes  are  unlike  those  of  any  of  the  other  Owls  of  its 
family  and  will  always  identify  it ;  their  deep  blue  colour 
gives  it  a  very  mild  expression  which  is  at  variance  with  its 
ferocity  in  pouncing  upon  game-birds  and  smaller  Owls, 
being  in  this  respect,  according  to  a  recent  government 
report,^  quite  a  cannibal.  The  same  report  says  that, 
though  it  does  make  inroads  into  poultry  yards,  the  result 
of  careful  inquiry  proves  that  the  greater  portion  of  its 
food  consists  of  small  mammals  that  are  the  bane  of  agri- 
culture. 

It  frequently  lodges  in  barns  and  hayloft^  during  the  day, 
and  all  about  this  region  it  is  called  the  Barn  Owl.  And  it 
really  is  the  Barn  Owl  of  this  locality,  for  the  true  Barn 
Owl  is  practically  unkno\\^l  to  the  farming  population ;  and 
when  stuffed  specimens  are  occasionally  seen,  having  been

sent  as  curiosities  from  some  other  place,  they  are  invariably 
known  as  Witch  Owls. 

The  Barred  Owl  is  a  noisy  species  and  announces  his 
presence  in  no  gentle  way.  It  is  supposed  to  be  shy  and 
to  love  deep  woods,  but  last  fall  a  pair  lived  for  a  month  or 
more  in  the  garden  evergreens,  appearing  towards  evening 
and  being  especially  active  in  the  late  dawns.  I  have  a 
very  perfect  specimen  of  a  female  shot  in  the  winter  of 
1893,  near  the  barn  where  it  was  perching  in  an  elm,  at  four 
o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  after  having  artfully  harried  a  flock 
of  tame  Juncos;  but  now  that  their  usefulness  has  been 
made  plain,  we  no  longer  shoot  Owls  indiscriminately. 

Saw- whet  Owl:    Nyctala  acadica* 

Acadian  Owl. 

Length :  7.50-8  inches.    Smallest  Owl  of  eastern  United  States. 
Male  and  Female  :  No  ear  tufts.     Above  brown,  spotted  more  or  less 

with  lighter  brown  and  white.      Striped  beneath  with  rusty 

brown.    Legs  feathered,  buffy  white.    Bill  black,  claws  dark. 
Note :  A  rasping  cry  resembling  the  filing  of  a  saw  (hence  the  name 

Saw-whet)  and  a  clicking  noise  like  "  Tlee-Klee,  Tlee-Klee  !'* 
Season:  A  whiter  resident,  locally  common    in   the  Eastern  and 

Middle  States.     Rare  here. 
Breeds :  From  Massachusetts  and  New  York  northward. 
Nest :  In  old  stumps. 
Uggs :  3-6,  white  and  nearly  round. 
Bange  :  North  America  at  large,  breeding  from  the  Northern  States 

northward. 

The  Saw-whet  is  a  night  Owl  and  spends  most  of  the 
daylight  hours- in  sleepy  seclusion.  This,  together  with  its 
small  size,  makes  it  pass  as  rare  in  places  where  it  is  really 
a  winter  resident. 

There  are  many  stories  told  of  the  soundness  with  which 
it  sleeps,  Mr.  Eidgway  citing  a  case  where  one  was  caught 
by  putting  a  hat  over  it  as  it  slept,  perched  on  the  edge  of  a 
Kobin's  nest  in  a  dense  willow  thicket.  It  is  a  sociable 
little  Owl,  of  a  cheerful  disposition,  and  is  easily  tamed, 
and  though  it  cannot,  owing  to  small  size^  prey  upon  many

of  the  stronger  mammals,  it  does  good  service  in  killing 
field-mice,  beetles,  etc.,  and  only  seems  to  eat  birds  in  times 
of  famine. 

I  have  never  seen  but  one  Saw-whet  in  this  neighbour- 
hood, though  I  have  heard  their  cry  many  times.  This 
one  was  found  dead  after  a  severe  autumn  storm  in  a 
beech  wood;  its  wings  were  broken,  and  it  had  evidently 
died  from  starvation.  This  poor  little  Owl  is  destroyed 
in  great  numbers  for  decorative  purposes,  and  is  thus  famil- 
iar to  many  people  who  have  never  seen  it  alive.  It  is 
the  bird  that  sits  in  a  pensive  attitude  on  a  gilt  crescent 
moon,  in  the  taxidermist's  window,  or  yields  its  pretty 
head  to  do  duty  as  a  rosette  on  my  lady's  hat. 

Screech  Owl:  Megascops  asio. 

Little  Horned  Owl. 

Plate  53. 

Length :  8-10  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Conspicuous  ear  tufts.    Bill  light  horn  colour. 

Two  distinct  phases  of  plumage  belong  to  this  species,  having. 

as  Dr.  Fisher  says,  "no  relation  to  sex,  age,  or  season."    In 

one  state  the  Owl  is  mottled  grayish  and  black,  and  the  other 

rust- red.     Feet  covered  with  short  feathers  ;  claws  dark. 
Note:  A  hissing  alarm  note,  —  "Shay-shay-shay!"  and  a  moaning, 

quavering  wail,  which  is  not  loud,  but  penetrating. 
Season :  Common  resident. 

Breeds :  Through  range  ;  in  April  and  early  May. 
Nest :  In  hollow  trees ;  sometimes  in  orchards,  near  dwellings,  and  on 

wood  borders. 
Eggs :  4-6,  almost  spherical. 
Bange :   Temperate  eastern  North   America,  south  to  Georgia,  and 

west  to  the  Plains.     Accidental  in  England. 

It  would  be  difficult  to  identify  the  Screech  Owl  by  a  de- 
scription of  its  colour  alone,  for  it  goes  through  many 
different  colour  changes  without  regular  rotation,  passing 
from  shades  of  wood-brown,  hazel,  tawny,  rust-red,  to  gray 
and  almost  black,  and  vice  versa.  Plate  IX.,  Figs.  7  and  8 
show  its  most  conspicuous  conditions,  and  all  the  novice  can

do  is  to  remember  its  length,  and  that,  of  our  two  small 
Owls,  the  one  having  horns  is  the  Screech  Owl. 

They  are  bright,  handsome  birds,  no  matter  what  plumage 
they  wear,  and  inveterate  mousers,  who  should  receive  every 
encouragement  and  protection.  They  eat  a  few  Song-birds, 
but  have  also  a  fondness  for  English  Sparrows,  which  wipes 
out  their  small  sins.  Mr.  George  C.  Jones,  writing  from 
Brookfield  Centre,  Fairfield  County,  Conn.,  says:  "I  think 
the  smaller  species  of  Owls  feed  upon  the  cutworm  to  some 
extent.  I  have  found  cutworms  in  the  stomach  of  the  com- 
mon Screech  Owl  and  in  the  Long-eared  Owl.  The  fact  that 
both  the  cutworms  and  the  Owls  are  nocturnal  leads  me  to 
believe  that  the  Owls,  of  all  the  birds,  are  the  most  eflB.cient 
exterminators  of  this  formidable  pest  and  should  on  this 
account  receive  protection."  Let  flower  lovers  protect  the 
Owls  by  all  means  then,  if  in  return  they  will  keep  the  sly 
cutworm  from  the  young  carnations  and  heliotropes. 

Great  Horned  Owl:    Bubo  virginianus. 

Hoot  Owl. 
Plate  54. 

Length :  19-23  inches  ;  female,  21-24  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Large  ponderous  birds.  Long  ear  tufts,  feathers 
mottled  irregularly,  buff,  tawny  brown,  and  whitish.  Iris  yellow, 
pupil  round  and  large,  with  great  power  of  contraction.  Feet 
and  legs  feathered.     Bill  and  claws  black. 

Note :  A  wild  startling  '*  Hoo-hoo-oooo  !  Waugh-hoo  !  " 

Season :  Resident. 

Breeds :  In  February  or  March,  but  the  young  grow  slowly,  remaining 
ten  to  twelve  weeks  in  the  nest. 

Nest :  Seldom  in  holes  at  the  north,  usually  a  bulky  nest  on  a  horizon- 
tal branch,  in  deep  woods.  Preferably  in  evergreens  and  near 
the  top. 

Sggs :  Usually  2,  dirty  white. 

Hange  :  Eastern  North  America,  west  to  the  Mississippi  Valley,  and 
from  Labrador  south  to  Costa  Rica. 

This  vigorous  and  untamable  Owl  is  easily  identified 
because  of  its  great  size  and  long  ear  feathers.     The  largest

GREAT    HOKNEl)   OWL. 

Length,  19-23  inches  ;  female,  2  inches  larger. 


BIRDS  OF  PREY.  Owls 

of  our  common  Owls  (the  rare  Great  Gray  Owl  alone  being 
larger),  it  is  a  bird  of  the  deep  woods,  swift  in  flight  and 
ferocious  in  the  extreme,  both  in  seizing  large  game  as 
well  as  in  fighting  when  disabled.  A  nocturnal  species,  it 
can  see  perfectly  in  bright  sunlight,  though  it  prefers  to 
remain  secluded.  During  the  nesting-season,  if  the  weather 
is  cloudy,  it  searches  for  food  both  day  and  night. 

It  is  the  most  destructive  of  Owls  and  of  all  the  birds  of 
prey  except  perhaps  the  Goshawk  and  Cooper's  Hawk.  Dr. 
Merriam,  in  speaking  of  its  mischief  in  the  farmyard,  says, 
"Indeed  I  have  known  one  to  kill  and  decapitate  three 
turkeys  and  several  hens  in  a  single  night,  leaving  the 
bodies  uninjured  and  fit  for  the  table."  (In  common  with 
many  other  birds  of  prey,  it  prefers  the  brain  to  any  other 
portion  of  the  victim.)  This  savage  Owl  also  destroys  vast 
quantities  of  large  game-birds  and  may  be  safely  considered 
undesirable  from  the  standpoint  of  the  small  farmer,  how- 
ever much  it  may  aid  the  tiller  of  vast  fields  by  its  destruc- 
tion of  vermin. 

I  have  seen  the  Great  Horned  Owl  sit  in  the  daytime 
with  its  inner  eyelids  closed,  and  then  suddenly  open 
them,  blink  once  or  twice,  and  fly  away,  snapping  its  beak 
angrily.  Its  hooting  cry,  uttered  in  the  bare  woods  in 
early  spring,  is  one  of  the  most  weird,  uncanny  sounds  in 
Nature.  Icicles  often  hang  from  its  nest;  and  ice  still  locks 
the  streams  as  it  sweeps  about,  suggesting  every  form  of 
dark  emotion  by  its  voice,  —  mocking  laughter,  despair,  and 
a  choking  rattle,  —  until  you  feel  that  the  Wild  Huntsman 
may  be  galloping  through  the  shadows  blowing  his  fatal 
horn. 

Snowy  Owl:  Nyctea  nyctea, 

Arctic  Owl. 

Length :  20-24  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Phimage  varying  from  pure  white  to  white  barred 
and  spotted  with  brown  and  black.     No  ear  tufts.     Legs  and 
toes  thickly  feathered.     Bill  and  claws  black.    Female  larger; 
young  darker  and  more  spotted.

Owls  BIRDS  OF  PREY. 

Note  :  A  growl,  a  bark,  and  a  hoot. 

Season  :  A  winter  visitor. 

Breeds :  From  Labrador  northward. 

Nest :  On  ground,  lined  with  feathers. 

Eggs :  6-10,  laid  at  long  intervals,  so  that  when  the  last  one  is  depos- 
ited the  first  bird  is  ready  to  fly. 

Bange :  Northern  portions  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere ;  in  winter 
migrating  south  to  the  Middle  States,  straggling  to  South  Caro- 
lina and  the  Bermudas. 

The  Snowy  Owl  is  one  of  the  dramatic  figures  of  the  winter 
landscape,  and  appears  like  a  personification  of  Boreas  him- 
self, coming  to  superintend  the  arranging  of  his  snow- 
drapery.  This  Owl  usually  precedes  or  follows  a  severe 
northeasterly  storm,  and  when  the  snow  has  ceased,  and 
you  go  down  the  lane  to  the  marsh  meadows,  breaking  your 
own  path,  the  Buntings  and  Shore  Larks  are  already  about 
searching  for  the  few  spears  of  seeded  grass  that  are  not 
beaten  down. 

The  incoming  tide  in  the  creek  breaks  the  thin  ice  into 
cakes  that  lie  one  over  another  like  transparent  shingles  on 
the  banks ;  the  flats  are  hidden  by  plates  of  burnished  silver, 
and  the  Gulls  hover  over  the  long  bar. 

The  sunshine  seems  blown  off  by  the  bleak  wind. 

As  pale  as  formal  candles  lit  by  day : 

Gropes  to  the  sea  the  river  dumb  and  blind  ; 

The  brown  ricks,  snow- thatched  by  the  storm  in  play, 

Show  pearly  breakers  combing  o'er  their  lee 

White  crests  as  of  some  just  enchanted  sea. 

Checked  in  their  maddest  leap,  and  hanging  poised  midway. 

—  Lowell. 

The  oak  island  is  edged  with  silver  birches  that  stretch 
marshward  like  whitened  poles  for  holding  some  great  nets. 
Low  down  in  one  of  them  sits  a  motionless  white  figure. 
Is  it  a  Barred  Owl,  frozen  and  snow  covered?  No!  it 
swoops  rapidly  in  a  circle,  and  seizes  a  hapless  Bimting, 
and  you  expect  to  see  the  snow  fall  in  powder  from  its 
wings,  but  it  returns  to  its  perch  white-flaked  as  before, 
and  you  know  that  you  are  face  to  face  with  the  Snowy  Owl,

—  the  bird  whose  ghostly  shape  furnishes  material  for  super- 
natural tales  told  by  the  humble  onion-growers  whose  cabins 
touch  the  marshes. 

The  Snowy  Owl  is  a  great  mouser  and  a  skilful  fisherman, 
only  devouring  birds  casually. 


Marsh  Hawk:    Circus  hudsonius. 

Harrier,  Blue  Hawk. 
Plate  65. 

Length :  17-19  inches  ;  female  averaging  two  inches  longer. 

Male  :  Above  bluish  gray  ;  below  white  mottled  with  brown.  Wings 
brownish,  long,  and  pointed ;  tail  long ;  upper  tail  coverts  white. 

Female :  Dark  reddish  brown ;  below  rusty  with  spots.  Bill  hooked 
and  black,  longer  than  the  Owl's  ;  feet  black. 

Note :  All  Hawks  have  a  screaming  cry,  but  it  is  of  little  aid  in  iden- 
tifying species. 

Season :  A  common  summer  resident ;  may  winter. 

Breeds :  Through  range. 

Nest :  On  the  ground,  one  foot  in  diameter,  of  grasses,  etc. ;  in  swampy 
meadows  or  among  rushes  in  marshes. 

Eggs  :  4-5,  whitish  ;  sometimes  with  irregular  blotches  of  brown  and 
gray  shell  marks. 

Mange :  North  America  in  general,  south  to  Panama. 

The  Marsh  Hawk  is  the  most  harmless  and  beneficial 
of  its  family ;  it  feeds  upon  reptiles,  locusts,  grasshoppers, 
and  small  mammals,  and  never  disturbs  domestic  poultry. 

In  this  locality  it  is  more  plentiful  in  the  bogs  near  fresh 
ponds,  and  in  the  vicinity  of  rivers,  than  in  the  salt-marshes. 

It  is  the  summer-day  Hawk,  and  the  species  most  fre- 
quently seen  in  the  warmest  months.  It  flies  by  night  as 
well  as  day,  however,  and  is  often  a  companion  of  the 
Screech  Owl  in  its  nocturnal  rambles. 

When  on  the  wing  the  females  and  young  may  be  distin- 
guished by  the  warm,  rusty  colour  of  their  under  parts,  and 
while  at  rest  by  the  white  upper  tail  coverts. 

I  have  seen  companies  of  the  females  and  young  every

season  in  a  strip  of  woods  near  Ciecos  Brook,  but  the  old 
males  are  very  wary,  and  seem  to  disappear  soon  after  the 
breeding-season. 

Sharp-shinned  Hawk:  Accipiter  vdox, 

Plate  66. 

Length :  12  inches  ;  female  14  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Wings  longer  than  tail.  Eyes  reddish.  Above 
bluish  gray,  deepest  on  head.  Beneath  whitish,  barred  on  the 
sides  and  breast  with  rusty  and  dark  brown.  Tail  even  or 
notched.  The  young  are  spotted  more  or  less  on  the  back  and 
streaked  below.  Head  of  this  and  next  species  smaller  than 
last,  while  legs  and  tail  are  relatively  longer.     Feet  slender. 

Season :  A  common  resident ;  coming  about  farms  and  even  city 
parks  in  the  winter. 

Breeds :  Through  its  range  ;  in  May. 

I^est :  Occasionally  on  a  rocky  ledge,  but  usually  in  some  thick  ever- 
green at  a  moderate  height  from  the  ground ;  a  bulky  platform 
of  sticks  with  an  upper  story  of  bark,  leaves,  and  moss. 

Uggs  :  4-5,  purplish  white,  spattered  heavily  with  dark  brown;  some- 
times the  spots  form  a  wreath  at  the  large  end. 

Mange :  North  America  in  general ;  south  to  Panama. 

This  small  and  very  common  Hawk  is  possessed  by  a 
spirit  of  dash  and  daring  altogether  out  of  proportion  to  its 
size.  Dr.  Abbott,  in  speaking  of  the  rapidity  of  its  move- 
ments, says:  "It  is  feathered  lightning.  He  ceases  to  be 
before  you  realize  that  he  is." 

The  Sharp-shinned  is  one  of  the  most  destructive  of  our 
common  Hawks  and  shares,  with  the  next  species,  the  repu- 
tation of  being  an  inveterate  poultry-killer,  and  it  causes 
such  sad  havoc  among  Song-birds  that  a  black  mark  may 
be  set  against  it  to  denote  that  it  is  a  worthy  target  for  rifle 
practice.  Its  dexterity  in  flying  allows  it  to  capture  by 
surprise  game  which  larger  Hawks  secure  by  weight  and 
strength  combined.  Nuttall  tells  of  a  Hawk  of  this  species 
that  came  day  after  day  to  a  farmhouse,  until  before  it  was 
killed  it  had  destroyed  between  twenty  and  thirty  young 
chickens.

Cooper's  Hawk  :    Accipiter  cooperu 

Chicken  Hawk. 

Length :  15-16  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Uniform  bluish  gray  above,  top  of  head  blackish  ; 
tail  crossed  by  several  blackish  bands  ;  below  -white,  with  breast 
and  sides  barred  with  dusky  or  rufous.  This  species  resembles 
the  last,  but  is  distinguishable  by  its  greater  size  and  rounded 
tail.    Feet  rather  stout,  greenish  yellow. 

Season :  Common  summer  resident  from  March  to  December ;  oc- 
casionally winters. 

Breeds :  Through  range  in  April  and  May. 

Xest :  In  the  tops  of  trees  in  thick  woods,  some  authors  say  in  ever- 
greens ;  those  I  have  seen  have  been  in  hickories. 

Fggs  :  3-4,  bluish  white,  either  plain  or  spotted  with  reddish. 

Bange :  North  America  in  general,  south  to  southern  Mexico. 

A  mischievous  harrier  of  all  birds  from  barnyard  fowls  to 
Song-birds,  doing  by  craft  what  it  cannot  accomplish  by 
daring  alone. 

A  country  woman,  who  is  a  very  successful  chicken-raiser, 
tells  me  that  she  loses  annually  more  chickens  by  this 
Hawk  than  by  weasels,  rats,  or  disease,  no  matter  how 
carefully  the  broods  are  cooped.  The  Hawk  takes  up 
his  post  on  an  old  stump  or  tree  in  an  adjoining  wood 
lot  and  gives  a  peculiar  cry,  which  seems  to  lead  the 
chickens  in  its  direction,  and  before  the  mother  can  give 
a  warning  cluck  one  will  be  borne  off.  They  will  seize 
rabbits,  squirrels,  and  Partridges  readily,  but  hesitate  to 
tackle  a  fully  grown  fowl,  unless  it  is  disabled  in  some  way. 

The  protective  instinct  of  the  mother  Hen,  when  a  Hawk 
is  in  the  vicinity,  and  the  unquestioning  obedience  of  the 
brood,  is  one  of  the  prettiest,  though  most  ordinary,  spring 
scenes  on  the  farm.  The  hen-coops  are  perhaps  barrels, 
laid  on  their  sides  with  slatted  ends,  ranged  along  the  road- 
side fence  opposite  the  farmhouse,  so  that  an  easy  watch 
may  be  kept  upon  them.  The  Hen  ventures  out,  scratching 
and  clucking  to  the  chicks  as  she  goes ;  they  follow,  strag- 
gling more  or  less  on  private  investigations.      The  sky  is 

217 


Hawka  BIRDS  OF  PREY. 

blue  and  cloudless ;  in  the  distance  hovers  a  bird  of  some 
sort,  but  it  is  a  mere  speck.  The  Hen  does  not  appear  to 
look  up,  but  suddenly  she  becomes  motionless.  The  speck 
develops  into  a  Hawk,  which  nears,  flying  in  circles  and 
descending  at  the  same  time,  so  that  it  is  difficult  to  predict 
where  it  will  alight.  The  Hen  crouches,  spreads  her  wings, 
and  gives  a  short  cry,  different  from  her  usual  cluck ;  instantly 
the  brood  rushes  pell-mell  to  the  offered  shelter,  the  wings 
drop,  and  when  the  Hawk  makes  a  final  swoop  within  two 
feet  of  the  ground  he  finds  nothing  but  a  very  broad- 
backed  and  resolute  Hen  flattened  in  the  dust,  and  he  dis- 
appears over  the  meadows  without  having  paused  an

Red-tailed  Hawk:  Buteo  borealis. 

Bed  Hawk,  Hen  Hawk, 


Length :  19-22  inches  ;  female,  22-24  inches. 

jlfaZe  and  Female :  Above  dark  brown,  variegated  with  white,  gray, 
and  tawny  ;  below  whitish  and  buff,  streaked  across  belly  with 
brown.  Tail  rust-red,  with  a  black  band  near  end ;  in  young, 
tail  gray  with  numerous  narrow  brown  bars.  Moderate,  horn- 
coloured  bill ;  feet  stout  and  strong. 

Season :  A  common  resident. 

Breeds :  Through  range. 

Nest :  Built  in  March,  in  a  tall  tree  in  deep  woods.  A  bulky  affair  of 
sticks  with  an  upper  nest ;  lined  with  soft  bark  like  the  Crow's. 

Eggs :  2-3,  dirty  white,  thickly  blotched  with  purplish  brown. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America,  west  to  the  Great  Plains. 

Owing  to  different  phases  of  plumage,  it  is  often  difficult 
to  identify  the  larger  Hawks  on  the  wing ;  but  the  red  tail 
is  a  distinctive  mark  of  the  adults  of  this  species  at  all 
seasons. 

Farmers  regard  it  as  a  nuisance,  and  kill  it  whenever 
they  can  as  a  punishment  for  poultry  stealing;  but  Dr.

Fisher  tliinks  it  is  a  mistake  to  destroy  it  unless  when 
caught  in  the  act ;  as,  after  careful  investigation,  it  has  been 
found  that  eighty-five  per  cent  of  its  food  is  made  up  of 
rodents  destructive  to  agriculture.  But  still  farmers  make 
scare-crows,  and,  when  possible,  shoot  a  Hawk  and  hang  it 
in  the  barnyard  as  a  warning. 

A  persevering  boy,  living  on  the  outskirts  of  the  woods 
near  Aspetuck  Mills,  secured  a  male  Eed-tail  and  two 
young,  this  spring,  and  I  saw  them  after  they  had  been  in 
confinement  for  a  week.  The  nest  was  in  a  particularly 
dangerous  location,  in  the  top  of  a  tall  hickory,  and  was 
reached  by  an  arrangement  of  three  ladders;  a  steel  trap 
was  placed  over  the  nest,  and  the  old  bird  secured  in  this 
way.  The  male  was  evidently  rearing  the  young  single- 
handed,  his  mate  having  probably  been  shot;  for  she  did 
not  answer  his  cries,  and  was  never  seen  about  the  tree. 

The  young,  at  the  time  I  saw  them,  May  30,  must  have 
been  about  five  weeks  old.  They  were  downy  and  poorly 
feathered  with  buffy  white,  barred  and  flecked  with  gray 
and  brown.  The  old  bird  did  not  struggle  for  liberty,  but 
seemed  perfectly  stoical,  only  turning  occasionally  when  the 
young  clamoured  (making  a  noise  like  the  sharp  peeping  of 
chickens),  to  ram  a  scrap  of  raw  meat,  of  which  there  was 
a  supply  in  the  cage,  into  their  mouths,  as  they  made  no 
effort  to  feed  themselves. 


Bed-shouldered  Hawk:    Buteo  Uneatus, 

Also  called  Hen  Hawk.

Length :  18-20  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Shoulders  rust-red.  Above  reddish  brown,  the 
middle  of  the  feathers  darker  than  the  edges.  Head,  neck,  and 
lower  parts  rusty,  transversely  barred  with  whitish  ;  tail  black 
with  white  bands.     Feet  and  nostrils  bright  yellow. 

Note  :  "  Kee-o,  kee-o  !  "  an  agreeable  sound.

Bald  Eagle  BIRDS  OF  PREY. 

Nest  and  Eggs:  Like  the  Red-tail's;  eggs  somewhat  smaller.    Nest 

often  used  for  several  seasons. 
Bange  :  Eastern  North  America,  west  to  Texas  and  the  Plains,  south 

to  the  Gulf  coast  and  Mexico. 

The  common  Hawk,  that  we  see  so  frequently  in  winter, 
sitting  motionless  on  a  bare  tree-top  or  stump,  in  the 
vicinity  of  inundated  meadows,  or  where  there  are  unfrozen 
springs,  for  it  is  particularly  fond  of  frogs,  etc.  At  a  dis- 
tance it  resembles  the  last  species,  but  at  short  range  its  red 
shoulders  identify  it.  The  Eed-shouldered  Hawk  is  a  dig- 
nified bird  having  an  Owl-like  flight,  and  when  at  rest  the 
pose  of  an  Eagle.  It  is  not  easily  disturbed,  and  will  sit 
half  an  hour  at  a  time  in  one  spot,  giving  you  a  fine  oppor- 
tunity of  observing  it  with  a  field-glass  or  marine  telescope, 
which  will  bring  it  so  close  that  every  feather  is  distinct. 

In  "Upland  and  Meadow"  Dr.  Abbott  draws  a  very 
interesting  picture  of  this  species  as  well  as  of  other 
Hawks,  and  says  that  their  soaring  and  screaming  over  the 
winter  meadows  is  one  of  the  few  bits  of  primitive  wild- 
ness  left  to  us.  This  species  is  a  hardy  and  valuable  bird ; 
at  least  sixty-five  per  cent  of  its  food  consists  of  injurious 
rodents  and  the  remaining  thirty-five  per  cent  is  made 
up  of  insects,  reptiles,  etc.,  with  a  very  small  proportion  of 
bird  food.

dark  brown ;  legs  feathered  only  half-way  down  ;  feet  yellow. 

Season  :  An  uncommon  resident,  coming  more  like  a  visitor. 

Breeds:  Through  range.

3  feet  deep  ;  either  in  large  trees  or  on  rocky  ledges.

AMERICAN   SPARROW   HAWK. 


BIRDS  OF  PREY.  Bald  Eagle 

The  white  head  feathers  of  this  Eagle  give  it  the  name  of 
"  Bald,"  which  in  reality,  of  course,  it  is  not.  It  is  called  a 
resident  in  Connecticut;  but  it  is  by  no  means  common, 
though  a  pair  may  usually  be  seen  sailing  over  the  marshes 
some  time  between  September  and  May. 

The  white  head  identifies  the  fully  grown  bird  beyond 
question;  but  as  it  takes  the  young  three  years  to  perfect 
their  plumage,  some  confusion  will  arise.  The  feathers  of 
the  first  year  are  uniform  dark  brown,  and  the  birds  are 
called  Black  Eagles.  The  second  year  they  are  known  as 
Gray  Eagles,  not  earning  the  title  of  Bald  until  the  third 
year.  Remember,  however,  that  the  Bald  Eagle  has  its 
claws  and  ankles  unfeathered  (while  the  other  American 
Eagle,  the  Golden,  is  feathered  to  the  claws),  and  then 
you  will  not  confuse  the  species. 

The  Bald-headed  Eagle  is  a  long-lived  bird,  of  majestic 
appearance,  whose  piercing  voice  can  be  heard  above  a  wild 
storm ;  and  for  these  qualities  it  was  unfortunately  chosen 
as  the  emblem  of  our  E-epublic,  for  its  noble  qualities  are  in 
reality  either  wholly  superficial  or  else  imaginary.  It  is  an 
inveterate  bully,  obtaining  a  great  part  of  its  food  by  rob- 
bing the  Fish  Hawk,  while  perfectly  able  to  fish  for  itself ; 
and  though  it  has  been  known  to  carry  off  lambs  and  young 
pigs,  it  has  been  vanquished  in  a  fair  fight  by  a  rooster. 
Preferring  a  fish  diet,  it  will,  however,  eat  any  kind  of 
animal  food,  even  devouring  carrion. 

These  Eagles  are  cowardly  parents,  but  devoted  as  couples, 
and  their  union,  on  the  evidence  of  good  authorities,  appears 
to  be  for  life.  They  travel  in  pairs,  and  never  in  flocks,  as 
is  the  habit  of  Vultures.  The  female  is  not  only  the  larger, 
but  the  braver  of  the  two  birds,  which  fact,  perhaps,  led  an 
enthusiast  in  the  latest  Woman's  Suffrage  scrimmage  to  de- 
clare that  the  Eagle  on  the  United  States  coins  is  a  female. 
It  certainly  takes  a  very  bold  bird,  indeed,  to  lend  its  coun- 
tenance to  our  silver.

Sparrow  Hawk  BIRDS  OF  PREY. 

American  Sparrow  Hawk:    Falco  sparverius* 

Plate  59. 

Length:  10-11  inches,  sexes  the  same  size. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  reddish,  with  or  without  black  bars  and 
spots.  Top  of  head  bluish  slate  with  a  red  patch.  Below 
varying  from  whitish  to  dark  reddish,  with  or  without  black 
spots.  Wings  narrow  and  pointed.  Female  has  dusky  bars  on 
back,  wings,  and  tail.    Bill  dark ;  feet  deep  yellow. 

Season :  Rare  resident. 

Breeds  :  From  Florida  to  Hudson's  Bay. 

Nest :  Lays  in  hollow  trees,  old  Woodpecker  holes,  and  sometimes  in 
Dove  cots. 

Eggs :  Variable ;  some  sets  plain  buffy  brown,  others  heavily  splashed 
with  dark  brown  or  wreathed  at  the  larger  end. 

Range :  Whole  of  North  America,  south  to  northern  South  America. 

This  is  the  smallest,  handsomest,  and  one  of  the  mos^- 
useful  of  our  Hawks.  It  is  one  of  the  three  small  species 
that  Dr.  Abbott  characterizes  as  belonging  to  the  impetuous 
class,  in  distinction  from  the  larger  Hawks,  which  he  calls 
meditative  and  deliberate. 

It  is  easily  recognized  from  its  small  size,  and  it  resem- 
bles a  big  Fox  Sparrow  with  a  hooked  beak  and  black 
whiskers. 

The  Sparrow  Hawk  has  the  Shrike's  trick  of  dropping  on 
its  prey  from  a  height,  instead  of  approaching  in  circles. 
They  collect  in  numbers  in  the  fall  and  early  spring  near 
bird-roosts,  and  seize  their  victims  when  they  emerge  in  the 
morning,  and  particularly  toward  night. 

Juncos,  Chickadees,  and  Tree  Sparrows  lodge  in  the  honey- 
suckle hedge  at  the  foot  of  the  garden,  and  late  one  March 
afternoon  I  saw  a  Hawk  in  a  cedar  tree  near  by.  I  watched 
half  an  hour  and  thought  it  had  gone.  Suddenly  a  Junco 
dashed  into  the  hedge,  followed  by  what  seemed  to  be  a 
brown  stone,  it  dropped  so  quickly,  striking  at  right  angles 
against  the  heavy  wire  that  supported  the  vine.  The  Junco 
escaped  through  the  trellis,  and  the  Sparrow  Hawk,  in  the 
moment  it  took  to  recover  itself,  gave  me  a  good  chance  to 
identify  it. 


BIRDS  OF  PREY.  Oeprey 

This  Hawk  is  a  consumer  of  beetles  and  other  large  in- 
sects, mice,  etc. ;  it  kills  small  birds,  and  sometimes  Pigeons, 
but  not  preferably. 

In  addition  to  the  six  Hawks  described  there  are  five 
other  species  belonging  casually,  either  as  migrants  or  resi- 
dents, to  the  same  range,  but  they  are  rare  and  not  easy  for 
the  novice  to  identify.     They  are  the 

Goshawk :  A  rare  winter  visitor. 

Broad-winged  Hawk :  An  uncommon  resident. 

Bough-legged  Hawk :  Rare  winter  resident. 

Duck  Hawk :  A  migrant  along  the  coast.    Rare  summer  resident  in 

Hudson  Highlands. 
Pigeon  Hawk  :  A  common  migrant  along  coast. 

American  Osprey  :  Pandion  haliaetus* 

Fish  Hawk. 

Plate  60. 

Length  :  About  24  inches ;  female  larger. 

Male  and  Female :  Plain  dark  brown  above,  the  tail  having  a  white 

tip  and  a  band  of  dark  brown.     Head,  neck,  and  lower  parts 

white ;  breast  plain,  or  sometimes  spotted  faintly  with  brown. 

Bill  bluish  black  ;  feet  grayish. 
Note :  "  Phew,  phew,  p-hew  1 " 
Season  :  April  to  November. 
Breeds :  From  Florida  to  Labrador. 
Nest :  In  trees  near  or  over  water  ;  a  bulky  nest  on  the  plan  of  the 

Eagle's. 
Eggs:  2-3,  variable  in  size  and  colour ;  average,  2^  x  If  inches. 
Range :  North  America,  from  Hudson's  Bay  and  Alaska,  south  to  the 

West  Indies  and  northern  South  America. 

The  familiar,  brown.  Eagle-like  bird,  with  very  large 
talons,  which  is  seen  hovering  over  Sound,  creek,  and  river, 
particularly  in  spring  and  early  fall.  The  Fish  Hawk,  as  it 
is  popularly  called,  follows  schools  of  fish,  and,  dashing  from 
considerable  height,  seizes  its  prey  with  its  stout  claws.  If 
the  fish  is  small,  it  is  immediately  swallowed ;  if  it  is  large 
(and  it  will  secure  occasionally  shad,  bass,  etc.,  weighing 

223 


Osprey  BIRDS  OF  PREY. 

five  or  six  pounds),  it  is  taken  to  a  convenient  bluff  or  tree 
and  torn  to  bits.  Sometimes  tlie  Fish.  Hawk  dives  quite 
deep,  and,  when  he  emerges,  shakes  a  shower  of  spray  from 
his  wings  and  rises  slowly.  It  is  at  this  juncture  that  the 
Bald  Eagle  usually  manages  to  rob  him  of  the  fish  by  either 
seizing  it  or  startling  the  Hawk  so  that  he  looses  his  hold. 
The  Osprey  when  fishing  makes  one  of  the  most  breezy  and 
spirited  pictures  connected  with  the  feeding-habits  of  any 
of  our  birds,  for  often  there  is  a  splashing  and  a  struggle 
under  water  when  the  fish  grasped  is  either  too  large  or  the 
great  talons  become  entangled.  Occasionally  the  Osprey  is 
carried  under  and  drowned,  and  large  fish  have  been  washed 
ashore  with  these  birds  fastened  to  them  by  their  claws, 
though  it  usually  feeds  upon  fish  of  little  value. 

I  found  an  Osprey's  nest  in  a  crooked  oak  on  Wakeman's 
Island  in  late  April,  1893.  As  I  could  not  get  close  to  the 
nest  (the  island  is  between  a  network  of  small  creeks  and 
the  flood-tides  covered  the  marshes),  I  at  first  thought  it  a 
monstrous  Crow's  nest,  but  on  returning  the  second  week  in 
May  I  saw  a  pair  of  Ospreys  coming  and  going  to  and  from 
the  nest,  and  then  obtained  a  nearer  view.  I  hoped  the 
birds  might  return  another  season,  as  the  nest  looked  as  if 
it  might  have  been  used  for  two  or  three  years  and  was  as 
lop-sided  as  a  poorly  made  haystack.  The  great  August 
storm  of  the  same  year  broke  the  tree  and  the  nest  fell, 
making  quite  a  heap  on  the  ground.  Among  the  debris 
were  sticks  of  various  sizes,  dried  reeds,  two  bits  of  a  bam- 
boo fishing-rod,  seaweeds,  some  old  blue  mosquito  netting, 
and  some  rags  of  fish  net,  also  about  half  a  bushel  of  salt  hay 
in  various  stages  of  decomposition,  and  malodorous  dirt 
galore. 

The  Fish  Hawk  is  said  to  breed  in  colonies  along  the  New 
Jersey  coast.  Here  I  have  only  seen  it  in  pairs,  and  though 
a  common  bird  it  always  attracts  attention  whenever  it 
appears.

The  beautifully  tinted  Wild  Pigeon  is  now  almost  a  thing 
of  the  past.  Thirty  years  ago  it  was  one  of  our  most 
abundant  Game-birds,  but  it  has  become  exterminated  in 
some  localities  and  is  a  rare  summer  resident  whose  appear- 
ance is  carefully  noted.  Old  housekeepers  remember  when, 
in  New  York  and  Boston  every  winter,  carts  loaded  with, 
these  birds  went  from  door  to  door  and  potted  pigeon  was  a 
standard  New  England  dish,  alternating  with  roast  beef, 
turkey,  and  sparerib. 

The  disappearance  of  this  Pigeon  is  only  a  page  in  the 
sad  history  of  the  destruction  of  bird  life  in  the  United 
States,  and  it  seems  as  if  the  founders  of  the  country,  as 
well  as  the  ever-increasing  stream  of  emigrants,  had  too 
much  faith  in  its  resources,  believing  it  to  be  a  land  not 
amenable  to  the  laws  of  Nature.  So  ruthlessly  have  these

Pigeons  been  slaughtered,  that  one  account  from  the  West 
records  instances  where  they  have  been  shot  down  by  the 
hundred,  and  left  on  the  ground  as  food  for  the  pigs !  The 
result  is,  that  all  game  is  only  locally  plentiful,  and  that  we 
have  less  in  general  than  countries  hundreds  of  years  older 
where  a  reasonable  protection  has  existed.  The  only  flights 
of  Wild  Pigeons  heard  of  now  belong  to  the  Northwestern 
States  and  the  Mississippi  Valley  at  large.  Then,  too,  the 
destruction  of  the  forests  and  far-extending  blizzards  have 
hastened  the  extinction  that  the  gun  began.

This  Dove  is  one  of  most  prettily  shiftless  housewives 
among  birds.  She  has  softly  coloured  plumage,  a  refined, 
though  sad,  voice,  and  many  gentle,  lady-like  ways;  but 
when  it  comes  to  nest-building  (and  the  female  is  always 
rightly  held  responsible  for  the  neatness  of  the  home),  she 
is  utterly  wanting.  Even  though  her  mate  should  decline 
to  furnish  her  with  a  more  liberal  supply  of  sticks,  she  could 
arrange  those  she  has  to  better  advantage ;  but  she  evidently 
lacks  that  indispensable  something,  called  faculty^  which 
must  be  inborn. 

The  eggs  or  bodies  of  the  young  show  plainly  through

roll  out,  but  they  seldom  do.  Meanwhile  she  coos  regret- 
fully, but  does  not  see  her  way  to  bettering  things,  saying, 
"  I  know  that  I'm  a  poor  housekeeper,  but  it  runs  in  our 
family  " ;  but  when  the  Doves  choose  a  flattened-out  Robin's 
nest  for  a  platform,  the  nestlings  fare  very  well. 

Though  inhabitants  of  woodlands,  these  birds  are  coyly 
sociable  and  always  build  a  nest  or  two  in  the  garden.  They 
usually  choose  the  pines  and  spruces,  and  put  the  nest  close 
to  the  trunk  where  two  adjoining  branches  start ;  sometimes 
the  nest  will  be  twenty  feet  from  the  ground,  but  it  is  usu- 
ally lower.  The  monotonous  cooing,  which  gives  them  their 
name,  is  a  rather  desolate  sound  except  as  it  blends  with  the 
morning  chorus. 

They  seldom  feed  upon  insects ;  but  prefer  seeds  of  various 
sorts,  and  glean  grain  from  the  fields  after  harvest,  though 
I  have  never  seen  them  take  it  from  the  ear,  and  they  can- 
not be  said  to  do  any  damage.  The  young  are  easily  tamed, 
if  taken  from  the  nest,  and  make  very  gentle  and  attractive 
pets,  but  are  of  too  gross  a  habit  to  be  kept  in  the  house.

The  most  abundant  and  attractive  of  our  Game-birds, 
whose  note  is  so  cheery  and  melodious  as  to  be  as  welcome  as 
an  elaborate  song.  In  April  and  May  the  clear  call  —  "  Bob- 
white  !  Bob-white  !  Poor-Bob- white  !  "  —  comes  from  the 
stubble  fields  and  bushy  roadsides,  with  the  staccato  ring, 
at  the  same  time  that  the  Meadowlark  sings  in  the  pastures 
and  marshlands.  At  this  time  Bob-white  may  be  seen  sit- 
ting upon  an  old  fence  rail,  telling  of  his  lonesome  plight, 
and  calling  with  a  total  disregard  of  the  presence  of  man. 
Again,  in  August,  you  will  see  him  with  his  spouse  and 
flock  of  young  running  through  the  underbrush,  or  in  fields 
where  the  grain  has  been  reaped.  When  the  first  gun  is 
fired  in  November,  they  take  warning  and  retire  from  the 
neighbourhood  of  settlements  to  thickly  bushed  hillsides, 
where  they  remain  until  absolutely  flushed. 

In  early  winter,  after  light  snow,  you  may  often  see 
Quails  scratching  in  the  buckwheat  fields ;  for  they  are  par- 
ticularly fond  of  this  grain,  and  you  cannot  do  a  kinder  act 
than  by  scattering  a  little  every  day  on  the  snow  where  you 
see  their  tracks,  as  they  frequently  suffer  from  hunger. 
Like  the  Ruffed  Grouse,  they  sometimes  burrow  in  the  snow 
to  hide  from  intense  cold,  and  an  ice  crust  forming  above 
them  they  are  unable  to  get  out,  and  die,  often  in  great 
numbers.  They  are  keenly  alive  to  the  benefits  of  protec- 
tion; for  three  successive  years  broods  were  raised  in  a 
tangle  underneath  some  old  quince  bushes  at  the  foot  of 
the  garden,  and  old  and  young  continued  to  range  in  the 
vicinity  all  summer,  returning  to  hide  in  the  shooting- 
season  under  a  hemlock  hedge.  The  fourth  year  they  were 
disturbed  by  rock-blasting  in  the  adjoining  land,  and  have 
not  since  nested  in  the  garden.  Two  and  often  three  fam- 
ilies are  raised  in  a  season,  and  the  breeding  sometimes  con- 
tinues so  late  in  the  fall  that  winter  overtakes  a  half-grown 
covey.  Twenty-five  is  not  an  unusual  annual  family  for 
these  vigorous  birds.

The  Ruffed  Grouse,  whicli  is  called  tlie  Partridge  in  New 
"England,  is  a  case  where  incorrect  local  nomenclature  has 
created  permanent  confusion.  It  is  a  true  Grouse,  and  the  real 
Partridge  is  the  Bob-white.  The  term  Partridge  seems,  how- 
ever, to  be  a  fixture  in  literature  as  well  as  in  the  markets. 

The  Ruffed  Grouse  is  familiar  to  those  who  have  been 
in  the  habit  of  walking  in  the  New  England  woods  or 
remote  lanes  in  the  spring  or  autumn ;  it  is  a  resident,  but 
is  more  apt  to  be  seen  at  these  two  seasons.  In  woods 
where  the  underbrush  has  been  thinned  out,  and  not  wholly 
cut  away,  and  where  shooting  is  forbidden,  this  Grouse 
shows,  in  spring,  almost  the  tameness  of  the  domestic 
fowl;  but  in  autumn  it  is  more  shy,  for,  if  protected  in 
some  places,  it  is  harried  in  others  and  become  suspicious. 

The  Grouse  mates  in  late  April;  and  when  the  chicks 
are  hatched,  they  immediately  leave  the  nest  and  follow 
their  mother.  They  obey  her  authority  as  quickly  as  chick- 
ens do  the  Hen,  except  that  when  they  hear  the  warning 
note,  they  dive  under  leaves  and  bushes,  while  she  leads  the 
pursuer  off  in  an  opposite  direction.    The  female  attends

to  the  duties  of  nest-building  and  incubation  alone;  the 
males  seem  to  feel  themselves  de  trop  at  this  time,  and  keep 
separate,  roosting  together,  and  rejoining  their  mates  when 
the  young  are  hatched,  and  then  they  roam  as  a  family. 

The  male  Ruffed  Grouse  has  the  same  habit  of  pluming 
and  strutting  as  the  Turkey-cock,  and  also  makes  the  drum- 
ming noise  which  has  caused  so  much  dispute  and  which  is 
attributed  to  at  least  four  different  causes.  This  peculiar 
sound  begins  in  spring,  and,  though  not  belonging  to  the 
breeding-season  alone,  is  most  frequently  indulged  in  at  that 
time.  It  seems  to  be  in  token  of  general  good  health  and 
spirits  as  well  as  to  call  attention  to  the  drummer.  Heard 
at  a  little  distance  it  is  a  hollow,  vibrating  sound,  beginning 
softly  and  increasing,  as  if  a  small  rubber  ball  was  dropped 
slowly  and  then  rapidly  bounced  on  a  drumhead. 

You  may  hear  the  drumming  fifty  times,  without  seeing 
the  bird  from  which  it  proceeds,  and  you  may  even  see  the 
bird  plainly  without  having  the  slightest  clue  to  how  the 
sound  is  produced. 

It  is  variously  stated  that  the  Grouse  beats  with  its 
wings  on  a  log ;  that  it  raises  its  wings  and  strikes  their 
edges  above  its  back ;  that  it  claps  them  against  its  side  like 
a  crowing  rooster,  and,  lastly,  that  it  beats  the  air.  You  may 
take  your  choice  of  the  methods,  the  result  is  the  same. 

Last  April,  when  in  the  woods  near  Ciecos  Brook,  I  saw  a 
Grouse  drum.  I  was  sitting  on  the  ground  and  the  bird 
flew  over  my  head  and  lit  on  a  rail  that  topped  an  old  stone 
wall;  his  back  was  toward  me.  For  a  few  minutes  he 
remained  quiet  as  if  listening,  ruffled  his  feathers,  raised 
his  tail,  moved  his  wings  slowly,  as  if  to  test  them.  Then 
beat  them  more  and  more  rapidly  until  my  eyes  blinked 
hopelessly.  When  the  noise  ceased,  the  wings  drooped 
slightly,  and  in  a  moment  more  the  bird  flew  away. 

This  almost  agrees  with  Thoreau's  positive  assertion  that 
he  had  seen  a  Partridge  drum  while  standing  on  a  wall,  and 
that  it  stood  upright  and  struck  its  wings  together  behind 
its  back,  but  striking  neither  the  wall  or  its  body,  and  he 
bravely  declares  that  any  one  who  affirms  the  contrary  is 

230

mistaken,  even  though  he  were  Audubon  himself,  A  snap- 
shot with  a  camera  might  settle  the  question,  but  the 
drummer  seldom  performs  in  places  where  the  light  would 
permit  of  a  photograph  of  whirling  feathers. 

As  a  Game-bird  the  Ruffed  Grouse  is  a  favourite,  having 
white  meat  of  a  good  flavour  and  less  dry  than  that  of  the 
Quail.  Sometimes  when  driven  by  hunger  it  feeds  upon 
noxious  berries  and  the  leaves  of  the  dwarf  laurel  or  lamb- 
kill,  which  may  render  it  unwholesome  food ;  but  if  the  bird 
is  properly  cleaned  at  once  no  such  trouble  can  ensue,  as  the 
leaves  and  berries  when  digested  cannot  injure  the  flesh, 
and  the  only  danger  comes  from  the  poisonous  matter 
remaining  in  the  crop  and  intestines  and  permeating  the 
entire  bird. 

The  eyes  of  the  Grouse  are  of  the  most  wonderful  depth 
and  softness.  This  autumn,  during  a  violent  storm,  a  young 
bird  with  a  broken  wing  and  leg  was  blown  against  the 
house  door.  I  took  it  in,  and  it  lay  for  some  time  in  my 
hand,  until  we  found  that  it  could  not  be  cured,  and  that 
the  kindest  act  would  be  to  kill  it.  I  shall  never  forget  its 
eyes,  with  their  deep,  expanding  pupils  and  the  golden- 
brown  iris.  Of  all  the  expressive,  speaking  eyes  that  I  have 
seen  among  animals,  the  eyes  of  this  bird  were  the  most 
beautiful  and  pathetic.

Plovers  SHORE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS. 

Season :  Common  migrant;  May,  August,  and  September. 

Breeds :  In  high  northern  latitudes. 

Bange :  Nearly  cosmopolitan ;  in  America,  from  Greenland  and  Alaska 
to  the  Straits  of  Magellan  ;  more  or  less  common  in  the  interior 
of  North  America,  on  the  shores  of  the  Great  Lakes  and  the 
larger  rivers. 

The  Turnstone  has  a  bill  that  looks  like  two  sharply 
pointed  ridge-backed  pens  placed  face  to  face.  He  uses  this 
as  a  pry  to  displace  small  stones  along  the  shore  to  secure 
the  various  bits  of  marine  life  lodging  under  them.  Hence 
it  is  more  common  about  the  base  of  rocky  cliffs  and  coves 
than  on  smooth,  sandy  beaches.  It  is  conspicuous  for 
its  size,  its  boldly  marked  plumage  contrasting  with  its  sur- 
roundings, while  Sandpipers  mingle  with  the  sands  and  can 
be  hardly  seen  at  a  little  distance  unless  revealed  by  some 
abrupt  movement.

Length :  11-12  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Breeding-plumage  black  and  white,  seldom  seen 
in  United  States.  Fall  plumage,  above  mottled  with  black, 
gray,  and  yellowish ;  beneath  whitish.  Wings  and  tail  nearly 
even.  Bill  long  and  black  ;  feet  black.   Axillary  feathers  black. 

Season :  Migrant ;  common  in  autumn. 

Breeds :  Far  north. 

Bange  :  Nearly  cosmopolitan,  but  chiefly  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere, 
migrating  south  in  winter;  in  America,  to  the  West  Indies, 
Brazil,  and  New  Granada. 

The  Plovers  are  wading  Shore-birds,  feeding  on  beetles, 
grasshoppers,  worms,  larvae,  and  fresh-water  shell-fish.  This 
species  breeds  in  the  Arctic  regions  and  appears  here  in 
numbers  in  the  fall  migration  only.  It  is  then  fairly,  but 
irregularly,  abundant  about  the  marsh-ponds,  and  is  an 
extremely  handsome  bird,  having  a  clear,  whistling  cry.  It 
arrives  about  the  middle  of  September,  after  the  general 
migration  of  the  Golden  Plover.

Field  Plover. 

Plate  64.     Fig.  2. 

Length:  10-11  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Subject  to  great  variations  of  plumage.  Above 
mottled  with  black  and  greenish  yellow  ;  whitish  below.  Axil- 
lary feathers  dark  ashy.     Bill  and  feet  black.

Breeds  :  Arctic  regions. 

Bange :  Arctic  America,  migrating  southward  throughout  North  and 
South  America  to  Patagonia. 

This  species  is  the  well-known  Plover  of  the  markets,  and 
the  favourite  of  sportsmen.  They  are  to  be  found  in  the  salt- 
marshes  and  about  sand-bars  and  tide-pools.  Their  coming 
is  irregular ;  sometimes  a  great  flock  will  alight,  and  then 
again  only  a  few  stragglers.  They  usually  pass  from  late 
August  until  middle  September ;  heavy  storms  may  delay 
them,  or,  if  the  weather  is  evenly  fine,  they  often  fly  over 
any  given  locality  without  pausing.  This  uncertainty  about 
the  arrival  of  many  birds,  especially  the  various  Water- 
birds  that  visit  us  only  as  migrants,  is  due  largely  to  the 
chances  of  weather.  If  September  is  a  pleasant  month 
and  there  are  few  gales,  the  great  body  fly  out  at  sea  and 
pass  Connecticut  altogether.  In  the  spring  migration  they 
are  but  little  noticed,  the  sportsman  must  not  shoot  them, 
and  the  bird-lover  is  kept  from  marshes  by  the  flood-tides ; 
but  when  a  great  storm  comes  during  the  fall  migration,  the 
Golden  Plover  not  only  flies  close  to  the  land,  but  flies  low, 
and  then  he  falls  an  easy  prey  to  the  sportsmen  who  are 
lying  in  wait  for  him. 

Killdeer  Plover:  ^gialitis  vocifera.

Plovers  SHORE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS. 

Note:  "Killdeer!  kill-deer!" 

Season :  Once  a  summer  resident,  now  rare,  remaining  from  March 

to  November. 
Breeds :  Through  its  range. 

Nest :  A  hollow  in  the  grass  or  sand  in  vicinity  of  fresh  water. 
Eggs :  4,  the  ground,  as  with  the  eggs  of  many  Waders,  varying  from 

clay  colour  to  cream,  marked  with  brownish  black. 
Range :  Temperate  North  America,  migrating  in  winter  to  the  West 

Indies,  and  Central  and  northern  South  America. 

You  may  hear  this  Plover  cry  and  yet  never  see  the  bird 
itself,  though  the  black-banded  breast,  white  frontlet,  and 
red  eyelids  make  it  easy  to  identify.  It  nests  in  our  marsh 
meadows,  arriving  in  March,  with  the  Bluebirds  and  Song 
Sparrows,  lingers  until  ice  has  formed  on  the  edges  of  the 
ponds,  and  yet  we  do  not  think  of  calling  it  a  common  bird. 
According  to  Wilson,  the  Killdeers  are  somewhat  nocturnal 
in  their  habits,  especially  in  feeding  upon  the  worms  that 
then  rise  to  the  surface  of  the  ground.  Their  loud  cry  — 
^^Killdeer !  Kill-d-e-e-r ! "  —  has  all  the  shrillness  of  the  Jay's 
scream,  and  the  Plover  uses  it  frequently  to  mislead  m- 
truders  or  lure  them  away  from  his  nest.  Coues  says  that 
"  they  abound  in  the  West,  are  not  gregarious  or  maritime 
extensively,  but  somewhat  irregularly  migratory,  and  are 
very  noisy  birds." 


Semipalmated  Plover:    JEgialitis  semipalmata.

across  breast  and  above  this  a  white  ring  across  back  of  neck. 

Half-webbed  yellow  feet. 
Season :  "  Abundant  migrant,  seen  on  flats  at  low  tide.   May  and  late 

July  to  late  September."

SHORE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS.  Plovers 

One  of  the  commonest  Plovers,  or,  in  fact,  of  Shore-birds 
in  general,  to  be  found  along  the  beaches ;  easily  identified 
by  means  of  the  complete  neck  ring,  white  upon  dark  and 
dark  upon  light. 

Like  the  Sandpipers,  they  dance  along  the  shore  in  rhythm 
with  the  ebbing  tides,  leaving  sharp  footprints  on  the  wet 
sand.  These  footprints  will  also  give  you  a  key  to  the  bird, 
for  they  show  that  its  feet  are  half-webbed  or  semipalmated, 
from  which  it  takes  its  specific  name. 

I  have  only  found  these  birds  along  the  seashore,  but 
Samuels  says  that  on  their  arrival  in  spring,  small  flocks 
follow  the  course  of  large  rivers,  like  the  Connecticut.  He 
also  found  a  single  pair  breeding  on  Muskeget,  the  famous 
haunt  of  Gulls,  off  the  shore  of  Massachusetts.  On  their 
return  migration,  these  Plovers  are  shot  down  promiscuously 
with  the  Sandpipers,  with  which  they  associate  closely. 

Piping  Plover :   JEgialitis  meloda. 

Pale  Ring-neck. 

Length :  6.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  light  gray.  Coloured  eye  ring ;  bill  yellow 
with  black  tip ;  partial  ichite  collar  on  back  of  neck  and  a  par- 
tial dark  band  on  throat.  A  black  bar  between  the  eyes.  Be- 
low white.  Legs  orange  yellow.  Female,  the  eye  bar  a  pale 
brown,  and  the  neck  rings  merely  spots. 

Season :  A  summer  resident,  but  not  common. 

Breeds :  Northward  from  Virginia. 

Nest  and  Eggs :  No  real  nest ;  eggs  2-4,  creamy  or  grayish,  with  brown 
scratches  or  small  spots  ;  laid  on  the  sand. 

Bange :  Eastern  Province  of  North  America ;  in  winter  the  West 
Indies. 

This,  the  second  of  the  Eing-neck  Plovers,  comes  to  us  in 
scattering  flocks  in  late  April,  which  a  month  later  separate 
into  pairs.  Samuels  says  that  it  sometimes  strays  into  the 
interior,  and  has  been  known  to  breed  on  the  borders  of 
ponds  twenty  miles  from  the  coast,  but  that  in  New  Eng- 
land it  seldom  wanders  far  from  the  shore,  and  prefers  sand

found  its  eggs  at  Muskeget  with  those  of  the  last  species. 
The  Piping  Plover,  as  well  as  the  Eing-neck,  live  upon 
insects,  worms,  eggs  of  fish,  small  Crustacea,  etc.

compact  body.  Above  variegated  with  brown,  black,  tawny,  and 
gray.  Below  brown,  ranging  from  buff  to  tawny.  Legs  very 
short.     Bill  longer  than  head,  straight  and  stout. 

Note :  A  peep  and  a  whistle.  "  P't-ul !  P't-ul !  "  and  "  peent,  peent "

Season  :  A  summer  resident ;  February  to  December. 

Breeds :  Through  range  in  April  and  May. 

Nest :  A  hollow  in  the  ground,  lined  with  a  few  leaves. 

Eggs:  4  usually,  varying  from  stone-gray  to  buff,  with  indefinite 
brown  markings  and  gray  cloudings.

The  king  of  our  Game-birds,  to  be  distinguished  from  the 
Snipe,  which  it  resembles,  by  its  heavier  build,  shorter  legs, 
and  plain  red-brown  under  parts.  Though  grouped  with 
Shore-birds,  it  is  more  frequently  to  be  found  in  sheltered 
bogs  and  in  woods  bordering  swamps  than  by  lakes  or 
rivers. 

The  Woodcocks  obtain  the  grubs  and  larvae  on  which  they 
feed  by  probing  in  the  soft  mud  with  the  bill,  which  is  so 
extremely  sensitive  at  the  tip  as  to  enable  them  to  select 
food  wholly  by  the  sense  of  touch.  The  eyes  are  set  in  the 
head  at  a  very  peculiar  angle,  which  gives  the  birds  a  rather 
foolish  appearance.  This  is  a  protective  provision  of  Nature. 
The  eyes  being  situated  high  up  and  far  back  in  both  the 
Snipe  and  Woodcock  enables  them,  by  increasing  the  field 
of  vision,  to  escape  from  many  of  their  enemies,  even  though 
they  cannot  see  their  food.

Woodcocks  are  as  nocturnal  in  their  feeding-habits  as  the 
Nighthawk  itself.  They  may  be  frequently  seen  in  April 
and  May,  an  hour  before  twilight,  peeping  out  from  the 
margin  of  woodlands,  picking  their  way  in  a  leisurely  man- 
ner to  their  feeding-grounds,  or  you  may  hear  their  short 
song  either  then  or  at  dawn,  and  see  them  make  beautiful 
flights  into  the  air,  sweeping  in  great  circles  and  rising 
spirally  like  the  Skylark,  leaving  behind  a  whistling  sound, 
as  if  the  wind  rushed  through  a  sharp-edged  reed.  At  this, 
the  breeding-season,  the  male  does  a  great  deal  of  strutting 
and  preening,  as  is  the  case  with  many  so-called  songless 
birds,  who  make  pose  take  the  place  of  voice  in  gaining 
the  attention  of  the  desired  mate. 

The  young  are  very  attractive  little  chicks,  following  their 
mother  as  soon  as  hatched.  Early  in  May  of  last  year  I 
happened  to  see  the  last  of  a  brood  of  three  emerge  from  the 
egg.  The  callow  little  bunch  had  scarcely  become  accus- 
tomed to  the  light  and  its  down  was  moist  and  limp,  yet 
when  the  mother,  on  seeing  me,  gave  the  warning  cry,  it 
disappeared  from  under  my  very  eyes  as  promptly  as  if  it 
had  studied  wood  tactics  for  a  lifetime,  and  nothing  re- 
mained but  some  bits  of  shell,  mingling  with  the  dead 
leaves,  at  the  roots  of  a  great  tuft  of  evergreen  ferns.

The  true  Snipe  of  sportsmen,  which  is  erroneously  called 
"English  Snipe."  Wilson's  Snipe  has  many  qualities  in 
common  with  the  Woodcock.  It  is  a  bird  of  fresh-water 
marsh  meadows,  where  it  returns  in  September,  and  is  usu- 
ally quite  plentiful  by  the  middle  of  October,  going  south 
when  ice  closes  its  feeding-grounds.  It  is  a  nocturnal 
feeder,  and  has  the  habit  of  soaring  into  the  air  at  dawn 
and  sunset.  Usually,  it  is  only  considered  from  the  food 
standpoint,  but  it  really  possesses  musical  qualities.  I  only 
know  its  peeping  cry,  that  seems  to  fall  from  the  clouds  in 
the  autumn  nights  when  the  migrating  flocks  pass  over, 
but  Audubon  says  that  the  male  and  female  birds  rise  into 
the  air,  —  "  now  with  continued  beating  of  the  wings,  now 
in  short  sailings,  until  more  than  a  hundred  yards  high, 
when  they  whirl  round  each  other  with  extreme  velocity, 
and  dance  as  it  were  to  their  own  music ;  for  at  this  junc- 
ture, and  during  the  space  of  four  or  five  minutes,  you  hear 
rolling  notes  mingled  together,  each  more  or  less  distinct, 
perhaps  according  to  the  state  of  the  atmosphere.  The 
sounds  produced  are  extremely  pleasing,  though  they  fall 
faintly  on  the  ear." 

Dowitcher:  Macrorhamphus  griseus. 

Bed-breasted  Snipe. 

Length :  Varying  from  10.25  to  12  inches. 

Male  and  Female  :  Bill  dark,  long  and  slender  like  last  species,  which  it 
generally  resembles.  *'  Riimp  and  tail  white,  the  former  spotted, 
the  latter  banded  with  black."  In  summer  plumage  the  back 
is  variegated  with  black,  ash,  and  red,  reddish  below ;  tail 
barred  with  dark.  In  winter  it  is  ash-gray  above  and  whitish 
below.     Feet  greenish  black. 

Season :  A  fairly  common  migrant  in  August  and  September. 

Breeds :  In  the  far  North.

SHORE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS.  Knot 

A  coastwise  Snipe,  very  handsome  and  richly  feathered. 
It  can  be  distinguished  when  skimming  over  the  marsh 
meadows  by  its  erratic  and  Swallow-like  flight,  and  at 
shorter  range  by  its  conspicuous  white  rump.  It  feeds 
upon  marsh  snails,  water  beetles  and  worms,  such  as  are 
obtained  in  large  numbers  in  the  mud  at  the  neck  of  tide 
bars  and  in  clam  beds.  Its  flesh  is  delicate,  and  it  is 
greatly  prized  by  sportsmen. 

Knot :    Tringa  canutus, 

Eobin  Snipe. 

Length :  10.50  inches. 

Male  and  Female  :  Straight  bill  1|  inches  long.  Above  black,  white, 
ash,  and  reddish  ;  crown  gray  streaked  with  black ;  nape  of  neck 
reddish.  Below  rich  chestnut;  legs  short  and  thick.  Young, 
the  first  two  or  three  years  until  they  put  on  the  full  plumage, 
gray,  black,  and  white  above,  white  below,  which  led  to  the 
idea  that  old  males  turned  gray  in  winter.    Female  duller. 

Note :  "  Wah-quoit !  "  and  a  honk.     (G.  H.  Mackay.) 

Season :  Irregular  migrant. 

Breeds :  In  high  northern  latitudes. 

Bange :  Nearly  cosmopolitan. 

This  Sandpiper  may  be  recognized  by  its  large  size  and 
very  richly  coloured  feathers.  With  us  it  is  a  bird  of  the 
sea-coast  and  marshes,  but  in  the  Interior  States  it  may  be 
found  about  the  larger  lakes  and  rivers. 

Mr.  Averill  has  shot  it  in  August  on  the  Housatonic 
meadows,  and  it  may  be  occasionally  seen  pattering  about 
the  pools  on  the  beach  at  low  tide,  in  search  of  small  shell- 
fish and  marine  insects,  which  are  its  usual  articles  of  food 
and  which  impart  a  marshy  flavour  to  this  as  well  as  to 
many  similar  Shore-birds. 

The  Knot  is  no  longer  a  common  Snipe,  and  any  one  who 
reads  Mr.  George  H.  Mackay's  very  interesting  monograph 
upon  it,  in  The  Auk  for  January,  1893,  will  easily  see  why. 
He  says,  not  only  have  they  been  wantonly  killed  on  the 
Cape  Cod  marshes,  by  the  process  known  as  "  fire-lighting,"

but  lie  has  every  reason  to  believe  that  they  were  formerly 
shot  along  the  Virginia  coast  in  spring  on  their  way  to  the 
breeding-grounds ;  he  says,  "  one  such  place  shipped  to  New 
York  City  in  a  single  spring,  from  April  1  to  June  3,  up- 
wards of  six  thousand  Plovers,  a  large  share  of  which  were 
Knots."  This  was  about  thirty  years  ago,  but  it  neverthe- 
less serves  to  illustrate  what  kind  of  treatment  these  birds 
received  in  those  as  well  as  later  days,  and  bears  out  the 
current  belief  of  to-day  that  the  Knots  have  in  a  "great 
measure  been  killed  off."  The  "fire-lighting"  method  of 
capturing  them  was,  "  for  two  men  to  start  out  after  dark  at 
half-tide,  one  of  them  to  carry  a  lighted  lantern,  the  other 
to  reach  and  seize  the  birds,  bite  their  necks,  and  put  them 
in  a  bag  slung  over  the  shoulder."  It  is  well  to  think  that 
this  also  took  place  many  years  ago,  and  was  stopped  by  law, 
to  the  honour  of  true  sportsmen,  who,  after  all  that  is  said 
against  them,  have  done  much  to  stop  the  butchery  of  game. 

Pectoral  Sandpiper :   Tringa  maculata. 

Grass  Snipe. 

Length :  9-9.50  inches. 

Male :  Above  black  and  reddish  ;  white  stripe  over  eye  ;  neck  short. 
Below  whitish,  washed  on  neck  and  breast  with  dusky,  broken 
by  brown  lines.  JRump  black  ;  wings  dusky  ;  some  tail  feath- 
ers tipped  with  white.  Bill  straight,  half  as  long  as  head, 
flesh-coloured  tipped  with  black.    Feet  dusky  greenish. 

Season :  Common  migrant ;  August  to  November. 

Breeds :  In  Arctic  regions. 

Bange :  The  whole  of  North  America,  the  West  Indies,  and  the  greater 
part  of  South  America.     Of  frequent  occurrence  in  Europe. 

A  fresh-water  Sandpiper,  found  in  wet  meadows  with 
Wilson's  Snipe.  It  comes  in  late  summer  from  its  northern 
breeding-grounds  in  flocks  of  variable  size,  and  remains  as 
long  as  the  insects  upon  which  it  feeds  hold  out.  Its  habits 
are  more  like  those  of  the  Snipes  than  of  Sandpipers,  and 
its  flesh  has  a  similar  sweetness,  lacking  the  rankness  of  the 
true  Shore-birds.  It  has  a  loud,  wiry  call :  "  Tweet-tweet- 
weet ! "  which  it  often  repeats  when  on  the  wing.     In  the

The  smallest  of  all  Sandpipers,  known  everywhere  by 
the  familiar  name  of  Peep  —  the  cry  they  constantly  give 
when  congregating  on  the  beaches  and  flats  at  low  tide.  It 
has  a  pretty  way  of  dancing  up  to  the  shallow,  frothy 
ripples,  meeting  them,  seizing  some  tiny  morsel,  and  retreat- 
ing with  a  sort  of  courtesy.  All  the  Sandpipers  have  a  half- 
shy,  half-sociable  way  of  flitting  afoot  about  the  water's 
edge  that  makes  them  very  sociable.  Often  at  low  tide  I 
have  walked  down  the  beach  toward  Penfield  Bar  with 
three  or  four  of  these  little  birds  for  companions ;  they  will 
run  on  ahead,  never  letting  me  quite  come  up  to  them,  and 
yet  half  expecting  me  to  follow.  This  habit  gave  motive  to 
one  of  the  best  bits  of  verse  that  Mrs.  Celia  Thaxter  has  left 
with  us :  — 

*'  I  watch  him  as  he  skims  along, 

Uttering  his  sweet  and  mournful  cry  ; 
He  starts  not  at  my  fitful  song. 

Or  flash  of  fluttering  drapery ; 
He  has  no  thought  of  any  wrong ; 

He  scans  me  with  a  fearless  eye. 
Staunch  friends  are  we,  well  tried  and  strong, 
The  little  sandpiper  and  I."     (3d  verse.)

Yellow-lega        SHORE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS. 

Dr.  Coues,  in  Ms  "  Birds  of  the  Northwest,"  gives  a  beau- 
tiful picture  of  this  bird  in  its  Labrador  breeding-haunts, 
where  the  fogs  hang  low  and  wild  waves  rage,  and  the  little 
Sandpipers  watch  their  half-sheltered  ground-nest  with 
anxious  devotion.  "Now,  later  in  the  season,  when  the 
young  birds  are  grown  strong  of  wing,  family  joins  family, 
and  the  gathering  goes  to  the  sea  beach.  Stretches  of  sand, 
or  pebbly  shingle,  or  weed-loaded  rocks,  or  muddy  flats, 
bestrewn  with  wrack,  invite,  and  are  visited  in  turn;  and 
each  yields  abundant  sustenance.  The  unsuspecting  birds 
ramble  and  play  heedlessly,  in  the  very  front  of  man,  un- 
mindful of,  because  unknowing  danger;  they  have  a  sad 
lesson  to  learn  the  coming  winter,  when  they  are  tormented 
without  stint,  and  a  part  of  their  number  slaughtered  in 
more  civilized  countries  for  mere  sport,  or  for  the  morsel  of 
food  their  bodies  may  afford.  Blasts  fiercer  than  they  ever 
knew  before,  come  out  of  the  north ;  autumn  is  upon  them, 
and  they  must  not  wait.  Flocks  rise  on  wing,  and  it  is  not 
long  before  the  beaches  and  the  marshes  of  the  states  are 
thronged." 

The  Semipalmated  (half-webbed)  Sandpiper  —  Ereunetes 
pusillus — also  shares  the  name  of  Peep  with  the  last  species, 
with  which  it  flocks.  It  can  best  be  distinguished  from 
the  Least  Sandpiper  by  it  feet,  which  are  half-ivehbed,  the 
Least  having  no  webbing.     It  is  also  slightly  larger. 

Greater  Yellow-legs:   Totanus  melanoleucus. 

Stone  Snipe. 


Length :  13-14  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Above  dusky,  spotted  with  black  and  white.  Bill 
green  black  ;  over  two  inches  long  and  slightly  recurved.  Be- 
low white,  streaked  sparsely  with  gray  on  the  neck.  Rump 
white,  also  tail  feathers,  which  are  barred  with  brown.  Long^ 
thin,  yellow  legs.

Breeds:  In  the  cold  temperate  and  sub-arctic  portions  of  North 
America.

SHORE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS.  Sandpipers 

Bange:  America  in  general,  migrating  south  to  Chili  and  Buenos 
Ayres. 

A  handsome,  noisy  bird,  commonly  seen  in  flocks  about 
sand  bars,  creeks,  and  inlets.  It  has  a  shrill  voice  and  gives 
utterance  to  the  most  weird  and  startling  cries  when  dis- 
turbed as  well  as  during  migration.  When  half  a  dozen  of 
these  birds  converse  the  sounds  are  like  the  ejaculations  of 
a  collection  of  shipwrecked  foreigners,  each  speaking  a 
different  tongue  and  mutually  angry  at  not  being  under- 
stood. It  is  followed  by  sportsmen,  though  as  an  article  of 
food  its  desirability  is  open  to  dispute. 

Solitary  Sandpiper:   Totanus  solitarius. 

Length :  8-9  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Long,  slender,  dark  bill.  In  breeding-plumage, 
dark  brown  above  with  an  olive  wash.  Head  and  neck  streaked 
with  white ;  rest  of  upper  parts  spotted  with  white.  Below 
white,  with  some  dark  streaks  on  the  breast.  Legs  dull  green- 
ish.    Markings  less  distinct  in  the  fall. 

Season :  Common  migrant  in  May  and  September. 

Breeds:  From  northern  United  States  northward,  and  believed  to 
breed  in  more  southern  localities.  Probably  a  summer  resident 
in  New  England, 

Bange :  North  America,  migrating  southward  as  far  as  Brazil  and 
Peru. 

Not  a  true  Shore-bird,  but  an  inhabitant  of  the  neighbour- 
hood of  wooded  ponds  and  the  margins  of  out-of-the-way 
watercourses ;  which,  if  startled  from  its  seclusion,  pene- 
trates the  underbrush  rather  than  expose  itself  by  flight. 
Wilson  states  that  this  Sandpiper  lives  in  watery  places  in 
the  mountainous  region  from  New  York  State  southwest  to 
Kentucky,  but  that  they  are  never  numerous.  Audubon 
notes  the  expert  way  in  which  they  catch  insects,  saying 
that  they  are  particularly  apt  in  seizing  small  dragon-flies  in 
their  descent  from  the  trees  to  the  muddy  pools  where  they 
breed.  In  this  neighbourhood  they  are  generally  seen  in 
pairs,  and  I  have  never  noticed  more  than  six  or  eight  dur- 
ing any  one  season.

Bartramian  Sandpiper :    Bartramia  longicauda. 

Field  Plover, 


Length:  11.75-12.75  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Bill  short,  grooved,  and  tipped  with  black,  but 
little  longer  than  the  head.  Above  dusky,  varied  with  yellowish 
and  gray,  a  pale  yellow  stripe  through  the  eye.  Lower  wing 
coverts  white,  banded  with  dark  gray.  Below  varying  from 
white  to  buff,  dark  lines  on  breast,  and  spots  on  belly.  Outer 
tail  quills  white,  barred  with  black.     Feet  dirty  yellow. 

Season :  A  summer  resident,  but  becoming  rare.  Noted  by  Linsley 
as  breeding  at  Stratford,  Conn. 

Breeds :  Throughout  its  North  American  range. 

Nest :  A  few  straws  and  tendrils  to  keep  the  eggs  together ;  in  locations 
similar  to  those  chosen  by  the  Meadowlark. 

Eggs :  4,  gray  or  cream  ground,  with  irregular  umber  spots. 

Bange :  Eastern  North  America,  north  to  Nova  Scotia  and  Alaska ; 
migrating  in  winter  southward,  as  far  even  as  southern  South 
America. 

This  species  is  classed  as  a  Wading-bird,  but  is  perfectly 
independent  of  water,  and  inhabits  meadows  and  uplands, 
for  which  reason  sportsmen  call  it  the  Upland  or  Field 
Plover.  It  announces  itself  on  its  arrival  by  a  long,  melo- 
dious whistle;  it  has  several  other  cries  in  the  breeding- 
season,  but  they  are  the  reverse  of  pleasing.  After  the 
young  are  hatched,  they  flock  with  the  adults,  visiting  the 
grass  fields  and  feeding  more  after  the  fashion  of  Meadow- 
larks  than  of  Sandpipers.  As  the  frost  blasts  the  inland 
fields  they  gradually  approach  the  shore.  At  this  season 
they  are  very  plump,  with  sweet,  well-flavoured  flesh.

SHOKE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS.  Rails

Season :  Common  summer  resident. 
Breeds :  Throughout  temperate  North  America. 
Nest  and  ^ggs :  Resembling  last  species. 

Bange:  North  and  South  America,  south  to  Brazil.     Occasional  in 
Europe. 

This  is  the  familiar  little  bird  of  roadside  brooks  and 
moist  meadows,  where  the  marsh  marigold  of  spring  is 
followed  by  the  cardinal  flower  and  gentian  of  autumn. 
To  me  it  is  indelibly  associated  with  gentian  meadows,  for 
the  first  time  that  I  ever  throughly  identified  it  I  was 
balancing  on  a  big  grass  hummock,  wondering  if  I  could 
step  across  a  particularly  deceitful  looking  bit  of  water,  half 
ditch,  half  sluggish  stream,  to  secure  a  plant  of  blue  fringed 
gentian  that  branched  like  a  magnificent  candelabra  with 
cups  of  lapis  lazuli;  —  and  this  Sandpiper  flew  from  an 
opposite  tussock  and  gave  its  plaintive  cry.  Seeing  that  I 
did  not  stir,  it  walked  unconsciously  along  the  edge  of  the 
ditch,  mincing  and  balancing  in  a  curious  way,  jerking 
its  body  in  see-saw  fashion,  which  has  given  it  the  name 
of  "  Teeter."  Every  few  minutes  it  flew  to  the  grass,  whis- 
pering to  itself  as  it  fed. 

The  Spotted  Sandpiper  possesses  all  the  delicacy  and 
beauty  of  a  Song-bird,  and  it  seems  as  much  an  act  of  cruelty 
to  hunt  it  down  for  sport  as  if  it  was  a  Thrush  or  Oriole. 
It  does  not  live  in  flocks.

Breeds :  In  dense  marshes,  most  abundantly  in  the  Carollnas. 
Nest :  A  collection  of  grasses  and  reeds  ;  on  the  ground,  barely  out  of 

the  reach  of  water.

casually  north  to  Massachusetts. 

The  Clapper  Rail  is  one  of  the  noisiest  of  most  obstrep- 
erous of  Shore-birds.  It  straggles  to  the  Massachusetts 
coast  in  summer,  and  is  at  times  quite  plentiful,  but  irregu- 
larly so.  This  is  the  species  that  is  killed  in  great  numbers 
among  the  salt-marshes  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Atlantic 
City,  ]Sr.  J.  It  takes  its  name  —  longirostris,  long  bill,  and

of  its  bill  and  the  incessant  noise  that  it  makes,  especially

known  locally  as  the  Little  Ked  Kail  and  is  a  perfect  copy, 
in  miniature,  of  the  King  Rail,  which  only  visits  us 
casually,  but  is  well  kno^vn  from  the  Middle  States  south- 
ward. The  Virginia  Rail  is  very  shy  and  will  always  hide, 
if  possible,  instead  of  flying,  and  it  has  the  faculty  of  run- 
ning across  water  upon  a  few  floating  sticks  and  bits  of  litter. 
Dr.  Coues,  in  his  "Birds  of  the  Northwest,"  in  describing 
a  night  scene  in  Arizona  near  the  Mojave  River,  where  he 
suffered  many  hardships,  speaks  of  the  haunts  of  the  Rail 
thus :  "  At  nightfall  some  Mallard  and  Teal  settled  into  the 
rushes,  gabbling  curious  vespers  as  they  went  to  rest.  A 
few  Marsh  Wrens  appeared  on  the  edge  of  the  reeds, 
queerly  balancing  themselves  on  the  thread-like  leaves,  see- 
sawing to  their  own  quaint  music.  Then  they  were  hushed, 
and  as  darkness  settled  down,  the  dull,  heavy  croaking  of 
the  frogs  played  bass  to  the  shrill  falsetto  of  the  insects. 
Suddenly  they  too  were  hushed  in  turn,  frightened  may  be, 
into  silence;  and  from  the  heart  of  the  bullrushes,  'crik- 
crik-rik-k-k-k,'  lustily  shouted  some  wide-awake  Rail,  to  be 
answered  by  another  and  another,  till  the  reeds  resounded. 
.  .  .  The  Rails  are,  partially  at  least,  nocturnal.  During 
such  moonlight  nights  as  they  are  on  the  alert,  patrolling 
the  marshes  through  the  countless  ways  among  the  reeds, 
stopping  to  cry,  ^  all's  well '  as  they  pass  on,  or  to  answer 
the  challenge  of  a  distant  watchman.  That  they  feed  by 
night,  as  well  as  by  day,  cannot  be  doubted.  Their  habit 
of  skulking  and  hiding  in  the  most  inaccessible  places  they 
frequent  renders  them  difiicult  of  observation,  and  they  are 
usually  considered  rarer  than  they  really  are."

Male  and  Female :  Bill  only  |  inch  long,  straight  and  stout.  Above

colour,  with  some  black  on  the  centre  of  the  throat.  Tail 
dusky  brown,  darkest  in  centre,  and  almost  pointed. 

Season :  Summer  resident. 

Breeds :  Freely  from  the  Middle  States  northward ;  in  brackish  and 
salt  marshes. 

Nest :  In  reeds,  near  water ;  a  slight  mat  of  marsh-grass,  etc. 

Uggs :  Distinguishable  from  other  species  by  the  distinct  drab  ground- 
colouring. 

Bange:  Temperate  North  America,  but  most  common  east  of  the 
Plains.  South,  in  winter,  to  the  West  Indies  and  northern 
South  America. 

The  common  Eail  of  gunners,  a  little  larger  than  the 
moulted  Bobolink  or  Reedbird,  with  which  it  is  closely- 
associated  in  the  southern  marshes,  sharing  with  it  the 
name  of  Ortolan. 

The  flesh  of  this  Eail  is  tender  and  sweet,  but  rather 
tasteless,  unless  an  artificial  flavour  is  imparted  to  it  in  the 
cooking.  Its  value  as  an  article  of  food,  as  in  the  case  of 
many  Eeedbirds,  depends  upon  the  curiously  enthusiastic 
taste  of  gourmands,  and,  as  with  the  Bobolink,  it  seems  a 
waste  of  powder,  as  well  as  of  exuberant  life,  to  kill  them, 
the  edible  result  being  a  pitiful  mouthful  of  gritty,  shot- 
filled  flesh,  stabbed  through  by  a  skewer,  and  merely  serv- 
ing to  lengthen  some  weary  dinner  where  a  collection  of 
animal  and  vegetable  bric-a-brac  takes  the  place  of  satisfac- 
tory nourishment. 

Florida  Gallinule :    Gallinula  galeata. 

Blue  Rail;   Redrbilled  Mud  Hen. 

Length :  12-14  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Head  and  neck  bluish  gray,  back  olive-brown, 
wings  and  tail  dark.  Beneath  dark  gray,  grading  to  white 
on  belly.     Bill  and  frontal  plate  red. 

Season:  Summer  resident  of  the  Housatonic  River.  Twelve  eggs 
taken  at  Stratford  June  25,  1891,  by  Mr.  W.  H.  Lucas. 

Breeds :  Through  its  range,  but  only  casually  in  the  northern  part. 

Nest :  A  platform  of  broken  and  matted  reeds,  built  up  to  form  a  hol- 
low nest,  seeming  oftentimes  to  rest  on  the  water,  as  it  is  moored 
to  shifting  reeds.

Eggs :  Numerous ;  often  14. 

Bange :  Temperate  and  tropical  America,  from  Canada  to  Brazil  and 
Chili. 

TMs  Gallinule,  which  inhabits  both  salt  and  fresh  marshes, 
is  called  Blue  Eail  by  sportsmen  because,  at  a  little  distance, 
the  various  tints  of  its  plumage  merge  in  a  grayish  blue.  A 
feature  of  the  family  of  Gallinules  (which  is  a  sub-family 
under  Kails)  is  the  bare  horny  shield  upon  the  forehead 
and  the  very  large,  unioehhed  feet. 

American  Coot :  Fulica  atnericana. 

White-hilled  Mud  Hen;    Crow  Duck, 

Length :  14-16  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Dark  slate  above,  head  and  neck  almost  black. 

Whole  edge  of  wing  and  tips  of  some  quills  white.    Below  paler 

gray,  tail  dark  brown.    Bill  flesh-white  with  a  slight  rusty  black 

mark  at  the  tip.     Feet  pale  dull  green. 
Season :  Abundant  spring  migrant. 
Breeds:  Locally  all  through  range,  in  marshy  spots  near  sluggish 

creeks  and  rivers. 
Nest :  Like  that  of  the  last  species. 
Eggs:  A  dozen  or  more,  shaped  like  Hen's  eggs,  ground  gray  with 

dark  brown  spots  from  the  size  of  a  pinhead  to  the  size  of  a 

pea. 
Bange :  North  America,  from  Greenland  and  Alaska  southward  to  the 

West  Indies  and  Central  America. 

A  bird  of  like  appearance  to  the  Florida  Gallinule,  having 
a  similar  but  smaller  frontal  plate.  The  feet,  however,  are 
constructed  for  swimming,  all  the  toes  being  supplied  with 
flaps. 

Its  nesting-habits  are  very  interesting,  being  akin  to  those 
of  the  Grebes,  and  Dr.  Coues  writes  graphically  of  them  in 
his  "  Birds  of  the  Northwest."

/Stake  Driver. 

Plate  68. 

Length :  Exceedingly  variable,  from  23-34  inches.     (Coues.) 

Male  and  Female :  Above  yellowish  brown,  much  streaked  and  mottled 
with  different  shades  of  brown,  from  dark  to  light.  Below 
buffy  white,  the  feathers  striped  and  edged  with  brown.  Tail 
brown,  small,  and  rounded.  Bill  yellow,  edged  with  black ; 
legs  yellow-green. 

Note:  Several  harsh  sounds  and  a  note  resembling  the  blow  of  a 
mallet  in  driving  a  stake,  hence  its  name  Stake  Driver. 

Season :  Summer  resident ;  May  to  November.    Not  common. 

Breeds :  Through  range  north  of  Virginia.    In  pairs,  not  in  colonies. 

Nest :  A  rude  affair  on  the  ground. 

JEggs :  3-5,  grayish  brown. 

Bange :  Temperate  North  America,  south  to  Guatemala  and  the  West 
Indies. 

This  is  the  solitary  Heron,  of  whom  Hamilton  Gibson 
says,  "many  have  heard  the  Stake  Driver,  but  who  shall 
locate  the  stake?"  It  inhabits  the  loneliest  bogs  and 
marshes  and  is  the  Booming  Bittern  to  which  Thoreau  so 
often  refers. 

Except  in  the  breeding-season,  it  is  an  entirely  solitary 
bird,  and  utterly  averse  to  companionship.  One  of  its 
habits,  when  disturbed  in  its  reedy  hiding  places,  is  to 
stand  motionless  with  its  bill  pointing  skyward,  thus  merg- 
ing completely  with  the  surrounding  marsh  growth. 

The  American  Bittern  is  not  a  nocturnal  feeder,  though 
his  retiring  habits  lead  people  to  think  so ;  he  probably  mi- 
grates by  night,  but  that  is  all.  He  seems  to  be  a  rather 
sluggish,  selfish  character,  mysterious  to  us ;  simply  because 
we  cannot  fathom  his  plan  of  existence.     He  eats  and  drinks,

but  is  never  merry,  and  maintains  a  stoical  silence  even,  in 
the  midst  of  a  bog  of  plenty ;  a  table  fairly  overladen  with 
the  frogs,  lizards,  snakes,  etc.,  that  his  appetite  craves.  His 
long  legs,  which  trail  awkwardly  behind  him  in  flight,  are 
said  to  act  as  a  rudder  to  direct  his  course. 


Least  Bittern :    Ardetta  exilis. 

Length :  11-14  inches. 

Male :  Top  of  head,  which  is  slightly  crested,  and  back  rich,  greenish 
black.  Back  of  neck  chestnut  brown,  also  wing  coverts  and 
the  edges  of  some  quills.  Tail  like  back.  Below  muddy 
yellow,  with  dark  brown  patches  on  sides  of  breast,  and  some 
white  around  the  throat.    Bill,  eyes,  and  toes  yellow. 

Female :  Purplish  chestnut  above. 

Season :  Summer  resident,  breeding  near  Stratford  on  the  Housatonic. 

Breeds  :  Through  range  in  marshes  in  company  with  the  Rails. 

Nest :  On  a  mat  of  old  rushes  a  foot  or  two  above  ground. 

Eggs :  Usually  4,  of  a  livid  hue. 

Bange :  Temperate  North  America,  from  the  British  Provinces  to  the 
West  Indies  and  northern  South  America. 

The  Least  Bittern,  the  smallest  of  its  family,  has  a 
curiously  hybrid  appearance,  and  is  not  easy  to  place;  it 
is  shy  and  always  hiding  in  the  reeds,  and  even  when  you 
catch  a  glimpse  of  it,  the  resemblance  to  a  Rail  is  confus- 
ing. You  may  startle  them  when  looking  for  Marsh  Wrens' 
nests,  and,  as  they  shoot  up  from  the  reeds  for  a  moment, 
before  settling  again,  you  will  have  your  best  chance  of 
identifying  them.  After  being  once  disturbed,  and  seeing 
the  cause,  they  remain  wisely  in  seclusion,  and  no  amount 
of  poking  and  thrashing  will  drive  them  out. 

As  with  the  majority  of  Shore  and  Water  Birds,  it  is 
almost  impossible  to  go  afoot  to  their  breeding-haunts.  A 
canvas  duck  boat,  easily  carried,  hip  boots,  and  a  water  and 
mosquito  proof  disposition  are  necessary  for  anything 
more  than  the  most  casual  study  of  these  birds  in  their 
haunts.

Blue  Heron         SHORE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS. 

Great  Blue  Heron :    Ardea  herodias. 

Blue  Crane. 

Plate  69. 

Length :  42-50  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Long,  black  crest,  the  two  longest  feathers  of 
which  are  shed  in  the  summer  moult.  Upper  parts  and  tail 
bluish  slate,  below  black  and  white  streaked,  forehead  and 
crown  white.  Feathers  about  neck  long  and  loose.  Bill  yel- 
low and  dusky  ;  legs  and  feet  dark.  This  Heron  can  be  recog- 
nized by  its  great  size  and  bluish  slate  back ;  it  is  not  distinctly 
blue  at  all. 

Season :  Common,  nearly  resident,  may  breed.     (Averill.) 

Breeds :  Locally  through  range. 

Nest :  Usually  a  nide  pile  of  sticks  in  a  tree. 

Bggs :  3,  large,  and  of  a  dull  bluish  green. 

Mange:  North  America  from  the  Arctic  regions,  southward  to  the 
West  Indies  and  northern  South  America. 

Without  question  the  Great  Blue  Heron,  locally  called 
the  Blue  Crane,  is  one  of  the  most  picturesque  birds  that 
we  have  in  New  England,  and  only  divides  the  honours 
with  the  Bald  Eagle  and  the  Great  Horned  and  Snow  Owls. 
In  many  places  they  appear  in  small  flocks,  but  I  have 
never  seen  them  here,  except  as  individuals  or  occasionally 
in  pairs.  They  are  wild,  suspicious  birds,  and  yet,  if  they 
think  themselves  unobserved,  they  will  stand  almost  motion- 
less by  the  side  of  a  small  stream  or  pond  half  a  day  at 
a  time,  only  bending  the  long  neck  at  intervals  to  seize  some 
frog  or  other  edible.  You  may  stand  by  a  smooth  mill-pond 
walled  by  trees  that  hang  into  the  water.  Through  many 
gaps  the  distant  meadows  stretch,  almost  as  smooth  as  the 
pond,  but  of  a  different  hue ;  it  is  a  lovely,  placid  scene,  but 
needs  a  bit  of  life  to  draw  it  to  a  focus.  Look  a  second 
time ;  upon  the  muddy  edge  of  one  of  the  little  islands,  in 
bold  relief,  sphinx-like,  stands  a  solitary  Blue  Heron,  and 
you  at  once  understand  why  Egypt  gave  reverence  to  the 
Ibis.  Deliberately  it  spreads  its  wings  that  winnow  six 
feet  of  air,  and  flies  slowly  across  the  water,  its  legs  hang- 
ing like  twin  reeds  with  clawing  roots.

SHORE  AND  MARSH  BIRDS.      Green  Heron 

Green  Heron:    Ardea  virescens. 

Poke. 

Length :  16-18  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Head  with  lengthened  crest.  Above  dark  glossy 
green,  sometimes  with  an  iridescence.  Edging  of  wing  coverts 
reddish.  Neck  a  rich  shade  of  chestnut,  with  a  purplish  wash, 
white  streak  at  the  throat,  and  under  parts  whitish,  shading  to 
ash  below.    Legs  and  bill  yellowish. 

Season  :  Common  summer  resident. 

Breeds  :  Through  its  North  American  range. 

Nest :  Of  sticks  in  a  tree,  seldom  high  up. 

Eggs :  3-6,  pale  green. 

Bange :  Canada  and  Oregon,  southward  to  northern  South  America 
and  the  West  Indies ;  rare  in  the  arid  interior. 

That  this  Heron  is  the  commonest  and  best  known  of  its 
family,  is  attested  by  the  numerous  local  names  it  bears. 
"Fly-up-the-creek,"  "Chalk-line/^  and  "Chuckle-head"  being 
a  few  of  the  list  to  which  every  small  boy  feels  it  his  duty 
to  add  one,  usually  of  a  very  uncomplimentary  nature. 

When  seen  in  the  breeding-season,  at  short  range,  the 
plumage  of  these  Herons  is  very  lustrous  and  beautiful,  but 
when  on  the  wing  the  iridescence  of  the  feathers  is  invisible 
and  the  receding  head,  accentuated  by  the  long  crest,  and 
the  poking  bill  give  the  birds  an  idiotic  expression. 

In  many  places  they  breed  in  communities  called  Heron- 
ries ;  but  here  usually  in  single  pairs,  in  the  wooded  strip 
that  runs  from  the  marsh  lane  to  the  eastward  of  Wakeman's 
Island.  The  Green  Heron  is  a  great  believer  in  ventilation, 
and  its  nest  always  reminds  me  of  the  boy's  definition  of  a 
sieve,  which  he  said  was  "  a  sort  of  round  thing  made  mostly 
of  holes."  The  sticks  of  the  nest  are  so  few  and  far  be- 
tween that  one  would  imagine  the  current  of  air  passing 
between  would  prevent  the  eggs  from  hatching.  I  saw  a 
nest  last  spring  that  had  listed  so  that  one  of  the  eggs  lay 
broken  on  the  ground,  and  there  is  a  very  good  story  told 
about  a  nest  that  was  such  a  shaky  concern  that  every  time 
the  old  birds  jarred  it  a  stick  fell  off,  and  the  structure  grew

smaller  and  smaller,  until  the  day  when  the  young  were 
ready  to  fly  there  were  but  three  sticks  left ;  finally  these 
parted  and  the  little  Herons  found  themselves  perching  on 
the  branch  that  once  held  the  nest ! 

This  species  feeds  upon  frogs,  small  fish,  insects,  the 
larvae  of  the  dragon-fly,  etc.  They  are  not  strictly  nocturnal, 
but  feed  largely  at  dawn  and  dusk.

white.  Crest  of  three  long,  white  feathers  rolled  into  one. 
Bill  black ;  legs  yellow. 

Season :  Common  summer  resident ;  April  to  October. 

Breeds :  Southward  from  New  Brunswick. 

Nest:  Nest  not  large,  built  in  a  very  slovenly  manner  in  treetops, 
usually  in  communities.

Another  common  Heron,  only  second  to  the  Green,  in 
abundance.  Here  it  frequents  inland  ponds  in  preference 
to  the  salt-marshes,  and,  though  I  have  not  found  its  nests, 
I  have  seen  the  birds  all  the  way  from  Mill  River  to  Bed- 
ding under  circumstances  that  point  to  their  breeding  in 
single  pairs. 

They  are  nocturnal,  as  the  name  indicates,  and  when 
you  come  upon  them  in  their  roosts  by  daylight  they  are 
dazed  and  sleepy,  and  use  an  effort  to  pull  themselves  to- 
gether, but  at  twilight  their  heavy,  dark  bodies  may  be 
seen  flying  overhead,  identified  beyond  question  by  the  cry, 
"  quok-quok,"  uttered  at  regular  intervals.  The  sound  is  much 
like  that  emitted  by  the  kid  bellows  of  a  child's  toy  rooster, 
and  is  the  gazoo  of  the  night  orchestra.  The  skirl  and 
boom  of  the  Nighthawk  have  an  eery  sound,  and  the  Whip-

poor-will's  cry  is  filled  with  vague  foreboding;  the  Night 
Heron's  merely  suggests  that  he  has  half  swallowed  a 
particularly  unappetizing  frog,  and  wishes  to  uns wallow  it. 

This  is  the  most  gregarious  of  all  the  Herons.  Dr.  Wood 
tells  of  a  swamp  some  miles  from  East  Windsor,  Conn., 
which  was  the  breeding-place  of  thousands.  Samuels  knew 
of  a  Heronry  near  Dedham,  Mass.,  where  a  hundred  pairs 
were  collected  in  the  space  of  an  acre,  and  he  at  once 
realized  the  force  of  Wilson's  comment  on  a  like  congrega- 
tion, that,  "  The  noise  of  the  old  and  the  young  would  almost 
induce  one  to  suppose  that  two  or  three  hundred  Indians 
were  throttling  each  other." 

As  the  birds  resort,  year  after  year,  to  the  same  crowded 
breeding-grounds,  it  can  be  easily  imagined  that  these 
Heronries  are  not  the  most  attractive  places  for  ornitho- 
logical research. 

I  had  very  much  doubted  the  present  existence  of  such 
extensive  colonies  in  populous  regions,  but  Mr.  Chapman  in 
his  "  Guide  to  the  Birds  found  near  New  York,"  which  has 
been  mentioned  before,  says,  "  There  is  a  colony  containing 
about  one  thousand  pairs  not  far  from  New  York  City."

drical, hooked,  or  saw-toothed."  This  is  good  advice,  for 
the  mission  of  the  Wild  Duck,  as  far  as  society  in  general 
is  concerned,  seems  to  be  the  epicure's  table,  where  it 
appears  in  various  stages  of  rawness,  according  to  the 
name  under  which  it  has  been  sold.  There  are  many 
Ducks  that  are  totally  unfit  for  food,  and  the  Merganser 
is  one  of  these,  being  a  ''  Fishing  Duck,"  and  able  to  fol- 
low its  prey  under  water.  It  is  a  gluttonous  bird,  gorging 
itself  with  such  quantities  of  fish,  frogs,  etc.,  as  to  render 
its  flesh  exceedingly  rank.  It  is  beautifully  feathered,  how- 
ever, and  frequently  figures  in  dining-rooms  on  the  orna- 
mental panels  of  stuffed  Game-birds. 

Another  species  associating  with  this  is  the  Eed-breasted 
Merganser,  which  hardly  differs  from  it  save  in  the  redness 
of  the  upper  breast  and  in  having  a  long,  pointed  crest. 
Both  species  inhabit  the  vicinity  of  fresh  and  salt  water  alike.

A  very  handsome  and  notable  game  Duck,  living  chiefly 
on  vegetable  diet,  and  having  delicate  flesh ;  plentiful  around 
the  Great  Lakes. 

Black  Duck:  Anas  obscura.

This  Black  Duck  (which  is  not  black)  is  a  great  favourite 
among  sportsmen,  on  account  of  its  delicately  flavoured 
flesh.  It  is  plentiful  about  the  larger  ponds  all  through  the 
autumn,  and  I  have  seen  it  on  the  mill-pond  in  December 
when  there  was  thin  ice  on  the  margin. 

The  late  Dr.  Charles  Slover  Allen  gives  a  delightful 
account  of  its  breeding-habits  on  Plum  Island,  in  T7ie 
Auk  of  January,  1893,  from  which  the  following  is  a  par- 
agraph :  — 

"Early  in  the  morning.  May  27  (1888),  I  saw  a  Rail  dodge  into  a 
little  clump  from  the  water's  edge,  and  in  trying  to  find  it  I  stepped 
into  the  Duck's  nest,  flushing  the  bird  and  partly  breaking  one  of  the 
s  257 


Ducks  SWIMMING  BIRDS. 

eleven  eggs  it  contained.  They  were  uncovered,  though  embedded  in 
down,  and  several  were  already  pipped.  The  old  bird  soon  came 
back  to  the  marsh  and  suddenly  appeared  in  the  clear  water  from 
behind  some  bushes  and  tried  to  entice  me  away.  After  cutting 
away  some  of  the  branches  concealing  the  nest,  I  started  back  along 
the  causeway  so  as  to  bring  my  camera  from  the  lighthouse.  I  had 
gone  but  a  hundred  yards  or  so  when  another  Black  Duck  appeared 
swimming  in  a  clear  patch  of  water  far  out  in  the  centre  of  the 
marsh.  It  vanished  behind  a  grassy  ridge  and  then  took  wing. 
Although  I  had  no  boots  I  waded  out  and  examined  a  tuft  of  bushes 
and  grass  far  back  in  the  direction  from  which  the  Duck  was  swim- 
ming. This  bird  had  undoubtedly  been  startled  by  the  outcries  of 
the  first,  and  had  quietly  left  her  nest,  only  showing  herself  when  at  a 
distance.  In  this  nest,  fairly  covered  with  down,  were  four  young 
already  hatched  and  not  dry  as  yet,  and  six  eggs  rapidly  hatching  in  the 
hot  sun.  "When  I  returned  to  this  nest  with  the  camera  an  hour  later, 
every  egg  had  hatched  and  nothing  but  the  empty  shells  remained.  I 
could  find  nowhere  the  slightest  trace  of  the  birds,  young  or  old." 

Green-winged  Teal:  Anas  carolinensis, 

Plate  72. 

Length :  14  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Slightly  crested.  Head  and  neck  rich  chestnut, 
with  a  band  of  green  on  either  side  behind  the  eyes.  Above 
waved  bars  of  black  and  white.  Wings  dull  gray.  Speculum 
half  purplish  black  and  half  a  rich  green,  other  wing  feathers 
having  chestnut,  white,  and  purplish  markings.  Below  whitish, 
turning  to  pale  brown  on  the  breast,  clouded  with  distinct  black 
spots ;  throat  and  sides  waved  black  and  white,  like  the  back. 
Bill  black  ;  feet  grayish.  Female  with  less  green  on  the  wings 
and  no  crest ;  mottled  brownish  above. 

Season:  Common  fall  migrant  about  the  Housatonic  at  Stratford; 
September  and  October. 

Breeds :  Chiefly  north  of  the  United  States. 

Mange :  North  America  ;  migrates  south  to  Honduras  and  Cuba. 

The  Teal  Ducks  are  two  very  small  species,  with  beautiful 
plumage  and  sweet,  delicate  flesh,  which  latter  quality  is 
accounted  for  by  the  fact  that  their  food  is  mainly  vegeta- 
ble,—  the  seeds  of  numerous  grasses,  sedges,  and  other 
aquatics,  small  fruits  and  berries.  They  also  eat  grasshop- 
pers and  many  other  insects,  and  tadpoles  as  well.  They 
are  preferably  fresh-water  Ducks.

SWIMMING  BIRDS.  Ducks 

Samuels  lias  seen  the  Green-winged  Teal  associate  with 
the  Ducks  in  a  farmer's  yard  or  pond,  and  has  known  them 
to  come  into  the  barnyard  with  tame  fowls  and  share  the 
corn  thrown  out  for  their  food.  Every  fall  I  have  seen  them 
flying  over  the  garden  by  twos  and  threes,  evidently  mak- 
ing their  way  from  the  interior  toward  the  coast,  which  they 
follow  very  closely  in  their  migration.  Oftentimes  they  fly 
so  low  that  the  peculiar  reedy  whistling  of  their  wings  can 
be  plainly  heard. 

Blue-winged  Teal:  Anas  discors. 

Length :  15-16  inches.  ^^^^te  73. 

Male  and  Female :  Bill  blackish.  Head  and  neck  purplish  lead-colour, 
black  crown,  small  white  crescent  before  each  eye.  Back  varie- 
gated dark  brown  and  yellowish  brown,  and  rump  dark  greenish 
brown.  Wing  coverts  dull  sky  blue.  Speculum  beautiful  green, 
between  white  bars.  Below  violet-gray,  spotted  with  black  on 
the  breast  and  barred  on  the  flanks.  Feet  light-coloured.  Fe- 
male much  the  same,  the  head  being  dusky,  but  retaining  the 
bright  wing  markings.     Other  markings  less  distinct. 

Season :  Common  in  the  fall  migration  with  last  species. 

Breeds :  From  the  northern  United  States  northward. 

Bange:  North  America  in  general,  but  chiefly  east  of  the  Rocky 
Mountains ;  north  to  Alaska  and  south  to  the  West  Indies  and 
northern  South  America. 

Eesembling  the  last  species  in  general  habits,  but  in  this 
vicinity  it  is  neither  as  tame  nor  as  plentiful.  Though 
it  prefers  fresh  ponds,  it  is  more  frequently  found  about 
salt  creeks  than  the  Green-winged.  It  has  been  known  to 
breed  in  New  England,  and  Giraud  notes  it  as  breeding  on 
Long  Island  also.

waved  with  soft  gray  and  black.  Wings  generally  gray  ;  specu- 
lum purplish  green  between  white,  a  bar  in  front,  and  a  black 
and  white  bar  behind.  Tail  long,  black  and  gray.  Below 
whitish,  with  black  wavings  on  the  sides.    Feet  lead-blue. 

Female :  Wing  markings  faint,  only  a  trace  of  the  speculum ;  tail 
shorter;  generally  mottled  above  with  black  and  yellowish 
brown;  below  pale  ochre-brown. 

Season :  Migrant ;  not  rare  at  Stratford,  Conn. 

Breeds :  Northward  from  the  northern  United  States. 

Nest :  Of  litter  on  the  ground. 

Eggs :  6-12,  greenish  clay  colour. 

Mange :  Northern  Hemisphere  ;  migrates  south  to  Panama  and  Cuba. 

Very  graceful  Ducks  of  trim  build  and  beautifully  mot- 
tled feathers,  long  body  and  well-poised  head.  Their  flesh 
is  excellent,  and  they  are  much  sought  after  by  the  sports- 
men who  go  southward  for  the  late  fall  shooting. 

According  to  Wilson,  it  is  a  bird  of  mud  flats  and  shallow, 
fresh-water  marshes ;  and,  unlike  other  Ducks,  which  when 
alarmed  scatter  in  different  directions,  the  Sprig-tails  mount^ 
clustering  confusedly  together,  and  thus  give  the  sportsmen 
a  good  opportunity  of  raking  them. 


Wood  Duck :    Aix  sponsa. 

Summer  Duck. 

Plate  3.     Page  21. 

Length :  18-20  inches. 

Male :  A  sweeping  crest  of  golden  green  like  the  head,  sides  of  head 
with  much  purple  iridescence.  White  stripe  from  reddish  bill 
to  the  eye,  and  from  behind  eye  to  throat.  Front  of  neck 
and  upper  breast  ruddy,  with  white  specks,  other  lower  parts 
white  ;  a  black  and  white  crescent  before  the  wings,  sides  more 
or  less  waved  with  black,  white,  and  yellowish.  Above  brilliant 
iridescent  hues, — purple,  bronze,  green,  etc. ;  speculum  green. 
Feathers  on  flanks  lengthened,  and  variegated  black  and  white. 
Legs  and  feet  yellowish. 

Female :  Crest  slight  or  wanting.  Gray  head  and  neck,  below  mottled 
gray,  brown,  and  white,  above  glossy  brown.  Wings  like  the 
male,  but  the  contrasts  much  reduced. 

Note :  "  Peet-peet,  oe  eek !  oe  eek  ! " 

Season :  A  summer  resident.

SWIMMING  BIRDS.  Ducks 

Breeds :  Through  its  range. 

Kest :  Usually  a  feather-lined  hollow  in  a  partly  decayed  tree,  near 

water  and  often  at  a  considerable  distance  from  the  ground. 
Eggs :  A  dozen  or  more,  varying  according  to  the  age  of  the  bird, 

either  greenish,  clay-coloured,  or  pale  buff,  and  smooth. 
Range :  North  America,  wintering  in  the  Southern  States. 

This  is  the  most  beautiful  of  the  native  Ducks,  taking  its 
specific  name,  sponsa,  betrothed,  from  the  richness  of  its 
plumage,  which  gives  it  a  bridal  or  festive  appearance.  It 
is  a  fresh-water  Duck,  and  exclusively  so  in  the  selection  of 
its  breeding-haunts. 

It  arrives  from  the  first  to  the  middle  of  April,  and  locates 
either  in  deep  woods  near  water,  or  in  narrow  wooded  belts 
that  follow  the  course  of  small  rivers.  Sometimes  a  hole  in 
a  horizontal  limb  is  chosen  for  the  nest  that  seems  far  too 
small  to  hold  the  duck's  plump  body ;  occasionally  it  utilizes 
the  hole  of  an  Owl  or  Woodpecker,  the  entrance  to  which 
has  been  enlarged  by  decay.  Many  stories  are  told  of  their 
attachment  to  their  breeding-places,  but  an  incident  which 
happened  a  dozen  miles  from  here  illustrates  it  as  well  as 
any.  For  several  years  a  pair  of  Wood  Ducks  had  made 
their  nest  in  the  hollow  of  a  hickory  which  stood  on  the 
bank,  half  a  dozen  yards  from  Mill  River.  In  preparing  to 
dam  the  river  near  this  point  in  order  to  supply  water  to 
a  neighbouring  city,  the  course  of  the  river  was  diverted, 
leaving  the  old  bed  an  eighth  of  a  mile  behind.  The  water 
might  move  if  it  chose,  but  not  the  Ducks,  who  continued  to 
breed  in  the  old  place. 

The  young  are  frequently  carried  in  the  bill  of  their 
parents  from  the  nest  to  the  water's  edge,  —  if  the  nest  is 
not  directly  over  the  water,  where  the  little  birds,  who  leave 
the  nest  as  soon  as  hatched,  can  easily  drop  to  it,  breaking 
their  fall  by  extending  their  wings. 

Audubon  says  that  when  the  nest  is  forty  yards  or  more 
from  water,  the  young  are  led  in  the  right  direction  by 
their  parents.  This  must  have  been  the  way  that  the  Ducks 
I  mentioned  regained  the  diverted  stream ;  for  the  height 
and  density  of  the  trees  between  it  and  the  nest  would  have

made  it  impossible  for  the  parent  to  fly  with  a  duckling  in 
her  beak. 

The  drake  does  not  assist  in  the  labours  of  incubation  and 
the  female  is  left  in  the  lurch  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Partridge.

Plate  74. 

Length :  20-23  inches. 

Male  :  Not  crested,  head  and  neck  a  warm  chestnut ;  bill  dull  bluish 
with  black  terminal  band.  Above  ash  waved  with  black  lines, 
giving  a  silvery  hue.  Below  white,  waved  with  black ;  lower 
neck,  fore  parts  of  body  and  lower  tail  coverts  blackish.  Tail 
grayish  brown.  Wings  gray  with  white  specks ;  speculum  whit- 
ish ash,  bordered  with  black. 

Female :  "  Wholly  brown  forehead  and  cheeks  tinged  with  red." 

Season  :  A  migrant ;  rare  at  Stratford  according  to  Mr.  Averill,  but  I 
have  seen  it  several  times  on  the  Fairfield  marsh- meadows. 

Breeds  :  Northward  from  California  and  Maine. 

Bange :  North  America. 

The  common  Wild  Duck  of  our  markets  which  often,

Canvasback :    Aythya  vallisneHa, 

Length  :  20-22  inches. 

Male :  Bill  blackish,  2^  inches  long,  or  not  shorter  than  the  head. 
Above  waved  black  and  white,  head  tinged  with  black  in  front, 
and  a  rich  glossy  chestnut  neck  and  back  to  head.  A  brovm-

SWIMMING  BIRDS.  Ducks 

Breeds :  From  the  Northern  States  northward  to  Alaska. 
Bange :  Nearly  all  of  North  America,  wintering  from  the  Chesapeake 
southward. 

The  favourite  Duck  of  dinner  parties  and  suppers,  where  it 
divides  the  honours  with  diamond-backed  terrapin.  The  par- 
ticular flavour  of  its  flesh,  when  at  certain  seasons  it  feeds  on 
vallisneria,  or  wild  celery  (which  is  not  celery  at  all,  but  an 
eel-grass)  won  its  fame.  But  as  this  eel-grass  is  a  local 
plant,  not  growing  all  through  the  range  of  the  Canvas- 
back,  and  as  when  the  celery  is  lacking  it  eats  frogs,  lizards, 
tadpoles,  fish,  etc.,  a  certificate  of  residence  should  be  sold 
with  every  pair  to  insure  the  inspiring  flavour. 

The  biography  of  this  Duck  belongs  rather  to  the  cook- 
book than  a  bird  list,  and  in  fact  even  its  most  learned 
biographers  refer  mainly  to  its  eatable  qualities,  and  Dr. 
Coues  even  takes  away  its  character  from  that  standpoint, 
saying,  "There  is  little  reason  for  squealing  in  barbaric 
joy  over  this  over-rated  and  generally  underdone  bird ;  not 
one  person  in  ten  thousand  can  tell  it  from  any  other  duck 
on  the  table,  and  only  then  under  the  celery  circumstances."

Breeds :  From  Maine  northward. 
Bange :  North  America,  in  winter  south  to  Cuba. 

The  American  Golden-eye  and  the  three  following  species 
are  Sea  Ducks  whose  Tank  and  fishy-smelling  flesh  excludes 
them  from  the  list  of  Game  Ducks.  They  are  seen  about  the 
creeks  and  beaches  at  a  time  when  there  is  little  bird  life 
present,  and  are  interesting  on  this  account.  The  "Whistler 
is  a  title  the  Golden-eye  receives,  from  the  loud  noise  made 
by  its  wings  during  flight,  which  is  accomplished  with 
wonderful  velocity. 

Bufflehead:    Charitonetta  albeola. 


Length:  12.75-15  inches. 

Male:  Above  black,  neck,  shoulders,  and  all  below  white.      Head 

puffy,  purplish  green,  with  a  large  white  patch  on  the  nape

well  as  on  the  coast.  It  is  a  cunning  diver,  and  obtains  its 
food  in  this  way;  it  is  said,  that  the  Bufflohoad,  like  the 
Grebes  and  Loons,  will  dive  at  the  flash  of  a  gnn,  and  re- 
main under  water  with  its  bill  alone  visible. 

Samuels  writes  that,  "When  several  of  these  birds  are 
together,  one  always  remains  on  the  surface,  while  the  others 
are  below  in  search  of  food,  and,  if  alarmed,  it  utters  a  short 
quack,  when  the  others  rise  to  the  surface,  and  on  ascertain- 
ing the  cause  of  the  alarm,  all  dive  and  swim  off  rapidly  to 
the  distance  of  several  hundred  feet."

Bange :  Northern  Hemisphere  ;  in  North  America  south  to  the  Poto- 
mac and  the  Ohio. 

A  clamouring,  noisy  Duck,  but  also  having  a  sonorous 
musical  voice.  It  has  the  same  habit  of  diving  as  the 
Bufflehead,  and  is  even  less  particular  about  its  food  than 
the  last  two  species.  It  locates  usually  on  the  reedy  creek 
bars  and  inlets  from  Long  Island  Sound.  Dr.  Coues  says  it 
frequents  large  inland  waters ;  and  Professor  Koch,  that  it  is 
a  visitor  on  the  Susquehanna  Eiver  in  April. 

American  Scoter  :     Oidemia  americana. 

Booby;  Sea  Coot. 
Length :  17-20  inches. 

Male :  Entire  plumage  blackish,  the  back  and  neck  being  more  or 
less  glossy.    Bill  tumid  or  bulging  at  base,  and  parti-coloured.

Canada  Goose  SWIMMING  BIRDS. 

Female:  Dingy  brown,  some  white  on  the  sides  of  head,  below  dirty 

white.     Dark  feet ;  bill  not  swollen. 
Season  :  Fall  migrant,  staying  well  into  winter. 
Breeds :  From  Labrador  northward. 
Bange :  Coasts  and  larger  lakes  of  northern  North  America ;  south, 

in  winter,  to  New  Jersey,  the  Great  Lakes,  and  California. 

This  Coot  has  no  beauty  of  plumage  either  in  male  or 
female,  is  wonderfully  tough  and  inedible,  and  is  often 
sold  by  unscrupulous  gunners  to  ignorant  housewives  as 
Black  Duck.  I  know  of  a  young  housekeeper  who  bought 
a  pair  under  these  circumstances.  The  difficulties  began 
when  the  Coots  were  plucked,  every  feather  offering  sepa- 
rate resistance.  The  legs  and  wings  seemed  held  firm  by 
brass  rivets,  and  were  immovable,  and  the  cook  made  scep- 
tical remarks,  which,  however,  passed  unheeded.  But  when 
the  ^^  Black  Ducks  ^'  appeared  nicely  browned  on  the  table, 
the  illusion  was  broken ;  it  was  impossible  to  carve  them ; 
even  the  breast  yielded  only  a  creaking  chip.  The  next 
day  the  dog  tried  one  of  them,  and  used  it  as  a  plaything 
for  some  time,  shaking  it,  and  occasionally  giving  it  a  hope- 
less gnaw.  Then  it  was  removed  with  the  swill,  being  still 
intact,  and  the  man  cut  it  in  half  with  an  axe,  to  see  if  it 
could  be  done. 

All  this  unscientific  research  goes  to  prove  that  the  Amer- 
ican Coot  is  a  strongly  built  and  most  muscular  bird,  and 
that  his  use  in  the  world  is  best  known  to  himself,  but  that 
as  a  table  delicacy  he  is  a  failure,  and  that  in  one  household 
the  mention  of  his  name  is  prohibited.

SWIMMING  BIRDS.  Brant 

Season :  Familiar  winter  resident,  but  most  common  in  the  fall  mi- 
gration, when  numbers  remain  until  very  cold  weather,  and 
return  all  through  the  early  spring. 

Breeds :  Chiefly  northward,  but  sometimes  in  the  northern  United 
States. 

Bange :  Temperate  North  America,  south  in  winter  to  Mexico. 

Tliis  Wild  Goose,  even  when  only  seen  casually,  is  easily 
identified  by  its  great  size,  being  almost  twice  as  large  as 
the  Brant,  the  only  other  common  species.  Its  distinctive 
mark,  other  than  size,  is  a  broad,  white  band  that  extends 
like  a  handkerchief  folded  cornerwise  under  its  chin  and 
tied  on  the  top  of  its  head. 

The  flight  of  the  Goose  is  heavy,  but  very  impressive. 
Geese  usually  form  in  two  columns,  meeting  in  front  on 
either  side  of  the  experienced  leader,  forming  a  wedge.  In 
the  late  autumn  of  1892,  I  saw  this  flock-formation  take 
place  near  Weston  Mill  Pond  shortly  before  dark.  The 
Geese  arose  in  a  straggling  column  from  some  cat-tail  flags, 
in  what,  to  me,  seemed  the  greatest  state  of  confusion,  but 
before  they  had  gone  a  hundred  feet  the  line  had  divided 
into  the  wedge  shape,  though  it  was  rather  irregular.  The 
honking  call  seemed  to  come  from  several  individuals,  and 
not  from  the  leader  alone. 

Upon  other  occasions  I  have  seen  small  flocks  fly  over  the 
meadows  in  almost  a  straight  line.  The  honking  of  Geese 
is  a  strange,  unbird-like  sound,  and  when  they  pass  over  at 
night  and  you  hear  the  fanning  of  their  wings  it  seems  as 
if  some  sleeping  cloud-goblin  had  awaked  himself  with  a 
sudden  snore.  As  these  Geese  feed  mainly  upon  vegetable 
food  their  flesh  is  good,  and  they  are  perpetually  harried 
by  gunners. 

Brant :    Branta  bernicla. 


Length  :  About  24  inches. 

Male  and  Female  :  Head,  neck,  shoulders,  and  upper  breast  dark  ash, 
white  patch  on  each  side  of  the  neck.    Back  with  a  brownish

"Wilson's  Petrel  SWIMMING  BIRDS. 

cast,  much  white  in  the  tail.    Under  parts  brownish  gray  with 

some  white.    Bill  and  feet  black.     Female  smaller. 
Season :  A  common  coastwise  migrant,  and  in  mild  seasons  a  winter 

resident  along  Long  Island  Sound. 
Breeds :  In  Arctic  regions. 
Jtange:  Northern    parts  of    the  Northern  Hemisphere.      In  North 

America  chiefly  on  the  Atlantic  coast ;  rare  in  the  interior  or 

away  from  salt  water. 

This  small  Goose,  hardly  larger  than  the  Red-headed 
Duckj  is  the  common  species  of  the  Atlantic  coast.  It  is 
not  so  well  known  among  amateurs  as  the  Canada  Goose, 
but  this  may  be  accounted  for  by  its  sometimes  being  mis- 
taken for  a  Duck.  Its  distinguishing  mark  is  the  small, 
white  patch  on  either  side  of  the  top  of  its  glossy,  dark  neck. 
The  food  of  the  Brant  is  like  that  of  the  Canada  Goose, 
but  anything  older  than  a  bird  of  the  year  makes  a  very 
muscular  article  of  food,  only  to  be  enjoyed  by  a  jaw  that 
has  grown  strong  by  much  arguing,  like  that  of  Old  Father 
William,  according  to  the  version  of  the  ballad  given  in 
"  Alice's  Adventures  in  Wonderland."

SWIMMING  BIRDS.  Gulls 

The  commonest  Petrel  of  the  Atlantic  coast,  from  Dela- 
ware Bay  northward ;  it  is  the  most  plentiful  of  the  three 
"  Mother  Carey's  Chickens."  The  Petrels  seldom  visit  the 
mainland  in  this  locality,  but  are  often  seen  about  light- 
houses. They  seem  like  the  very  spirits  of  wind  and  waves, 
dropping  and  whirling,  resting  a  moment  in  the  trough  of 
the  sea,  and  then  off  again,  tirelessly  following  in  the  wake 
of  vessels.  Mr.  Judson,  the  keeper  of  the  Stratford  light, 
kept  one  of  these  Petrels,  which  he  caught,  in  captivity  for 
some  time. 

Another  species.  Leach's  or  the  White-rumped  Petrel,  is 
common  off  the  Kew  England  coast,  where  it  is  resident  on 
some  of  the  islands,  off  the  coast  of  Maine.  It  lays  a  single 
egg  in  a  ground  burrow.  This  species  is  of  the  same  size 
and  general  appearance  as  Wilson's,  but  has  much  longer 
legs. 


ORDER  LONGIPENNES  :   LONG-WINGED 
SWIxMMERS. 

FAMILY  LARID^:    GULLS  AND  TERNS. 

Kittiwake  Gull :    Rissa  tridactyla. 

Length :  16-18  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Bluish  gray  above   (darker  in  winter),  head  and 

neck  gray,  and  bill  light  yellow.    Under  parts  pure  white.   Black 

feet,  black  tips  to  tail  quills. 
Season :  Winter  and  late  fall  visitor  in  the  Middle  States.     In  New 

England  common  off  the  coast  all  winter. 
Breeds:  Gulf  of  St.  Lawrence,  Labrador  coast,  and  casually  off  the 

Maine  coast. 
Nest :  By  choice  on  rocky  ledges  over  the  water. 
Bange :  Arctic  regions,  south  in  eastern  North  America,  in  winter,  to 

the  Great  Lakes  and  the  Middle  States. 

The  Kittiwake  may  be  regarded  as  a  winter  migrant  or 
visitor  along  the  shore,  where  it  comes  in  small  numbers 
early  in  December,  associating  with  the  Herring  Gulls,  but 
it  is  plentiful  from  Massachusetts  and  Rhode  Island  north- 
ward.

Winter  Gull. 

Plate  77.     Fig.  1. 

Length :  24-25  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Winter  dress :  above  pure  light  gray,  head  and 
neck  streaked  with  dusky,  under  parts  and  tail  white,  the  latter 
'  having  an  imperfect  dusky  bar ;  wing  coverts  mottled  with  gray. 
Bill  yellow. 

Season  :  Common  winter  resident,  coming  in  late  August  and  remain- 
ing until  March. 

Breeds :  From  the  Great  Lakes  and  Maine  northward. 

Nest :  Hollow  in  the  ground  lined  with  a  little  grass  or  a  few  seaweeds. 

Eggs :  2-3,  gi'ound  colour  dirty  white,  tinted  with  pale  blue  or  green 
deepening  to  brown,  with  numerous  brown  and  black  spots  and 
markings. 

Bange :  North  America  generally,  in  winter  south  to  Cuba  and  lower 
California. 

The  common  Gull,  both  of  coast  and  interior,  seen  in 
great  flocks  about  the  beaches,  and  on  the  flats  and  sand  bars 
at  low  water.  From  middle  autumn  until  the  birds  in 
general  are  returning  in  the  spring,  these  Gulls  enliven  the 
solitude  of  the  shore  with  their  chatter,  and  their  shrilly 
high-keyed  voices  can  be  heard  above  the  waves  and  storm. 

Beside  being  beautifully  plumed  and  decidedly  picturesque 
objects  in  the  marine  picture,  they  have  an  economic  value 
which  appeals  even  to  the  most  unsentimental  minds.  They 
are  excellent  scavengers,  taking  from  creeks,  bays,  and 
rivers,  as  well  as  from  the  lakes  and  open  sea,  much  refuse 
that  becomes  unsavoury  if  washed  ashore  and  left  to  decom- 
pose.

mingled  with  the  slate-colour  of  the  adults  on  the  wings,  and 

clouded  with  gray  on  the  breast. 
Season :  A  summer  visitor ;  once  a  common  summer  resident  on  Long 

Island,  but  now  rare. 
Breeds :  Off  the  Atlantic  coast,  from  Maine  to  Florida. 
Xest :  Of  dried  sea  grasses  and  beach-grass  stubbs. 
Eggs:  2-3,  shaded  olive,  spotted  and  splashed  irregularly  with  dull 

reddish  purple,  and  black-brown. 
Bange :  Eastern  tropical  and  warm  temperate  America,  chiefly  along 

the  sea-coast,  from  Maine  to  Brazil;  Pacific  coast  of  middle 

America. 

This  Gull,  taking  its  name  from  the  peculiar  quality  of  its 
cry,  which  is  like  a  peal  of  laughter,  belongs  more  commonly 
to  the  coast  south  of  New  York  than  to  New  England.  It 
breeds,  however,  on  Muskeget,  and  Mr.  George  H.  Mackay 
gives  an  account  of  its  habits  in  The  Auk  of  October,  1893. 
He  says  that  formerly  they  were  much  more  plentiful  than 
to-day, — the  same  sad  story  of  all  the  soft-hued  Water-birds 
who  have  been  hunted  even  from  their  sea-bound  homes. 
But  this  abuse  is  somewhat  abating,  —  at  least,  so  all  bird- 
lovers  hope,  —  and  there  are  fewer  of  our  native  birds  seen  in 
millinery,  and  the  feathers,  other  than  Ostrich-plumes,  that 
are  used  now  are  largely  dyed  and  baked  chicken  feathers, 
twisted  into  many  contortions,  or  queer  birds  with  celluloid 
beaks,  ugly  enough  to  make  bird-wearing  unfashionable. 
Many  tropical  birds,  however,  are  still  used  in  making  up 
these  grotesque  adornments. 


Bonaparte's  Gull:    Larus  Philadelphia. 


Length :  14  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Head  and  upper  neck  dark  lead-colour ;  bill  black ; 

back  "gull-blue."     Rump  and  tail  white;    also  under  parts. 

Wings  white  and  gull-blue.     In  winter  the  head  is  white,  with 

dark  spots.     Legs  and  feet  light  red. 
Season :  Common  migrant  in  spring  and  fall,  and  sometimes  winters. 
Breeds :  Mostly  north  of  the  United  States. 
Bange :  Whole  of  North  America ;  souths  in  winter,  to  Mexico  and 

Central  Anjerica.

Terns  SWIMMING  BIRDS. 

A  very  handsome  little  Gull,  with,  a  darting,  skimming 
flight,  resembling  that  of  the  common  Tern  or  Sea  Swallow. 
It  passes  up  the  Sound  in  scattering  flocks  in  early  spring 
(Mr.  Averill  having  noted  large  flocks  April  21,  1888),  and 
is  frequently  seen  in  the  autumn,  while  individuals  appear 
at  intervals  during  the  summer.  It  feeds  upon  insects  and 
large  beetles,  as  well  as  marine  food. 

Common  Tern:  Sterna  hirundo. 

Sea  Swallow. 

Plate  77.    Fig.  2. 
Length:  14.50  inches. 
Male  and  Female :  Bill  long,  coral-red  at  base,  black  toward  end  and 

tipped  with  yellow.    Upper  head  and  back  of   neck  black. 

Entire  back  and  wings  light  gray  with  a  bluish  wash.     Tail 

coverts,  most  of  tail,  and  wing  linings  white ;  belly  and  sides 

of  breast  grayish  white ;  other  lower  parts  white.    Legs  and 

feet  light  red. 
Season :  Summer  resident,  breeding  about  the  eastern  part  of  Long 

Island  Sound. 
Breeds :  From  the  Arctic  coast,  somewhat  irregularly  to  Florida  and 

Texas. 
Nest :  None  ;  eggs  laid  on  the  sand  and  indistinguishable  from  those 

of  other  species. 
JRange :  Greater  part  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere.     In  North  America 

chiefly  confined  to  the  Eastern  Province,  and  wintering  from 

Texas  and  Florida  to  southward. 

The  characteristics  of  this  Tern  are  the  black  cap,  coral- 
red  bill,  legs,  and  feet. 

The  Terns  are  not  distinctly  different  from  the  Gulls,  the 
size  of  some  being  identical;  but  the  Terns  have  a  more 
trig,  thoroughbred  build,  and  bear  the  same  relation  to  the 
more  ponderous  Gulls  that  a  yacht  does  to  a  trading-craft 
of  equal  tonnage.  The  Terns  have  long,  sharply  pointed 
wings  that  give  them  a  Swallow-like  dash  in  flying  either 
over  the  surface  of  the  water  when  fishing,  or  above  the 
reed  beds  when  searching  for  insects,  some  species  being' 
partly  insectivorous.  This  free,  angled  flight  has  given  this 
species  the  name  of  Sea  Swallow. 

272 


SWIMMING  BIRDS.  Terng 

When  flying  over  the  water  in  fishing,  they  hold  their 
beaks  at  right  angles  with  their  bodies,  instead  of  poking 
them  forward  like  the  Herons,  which  attitude  makes  them, 
Dr.  Coues  says,  "  curiously  like  colossal  mosquitoes." 

Terns  were  very  plentiful  twenty  years  ago,  but  the  per- 
secution for  millinery  purposes  has  thinned  the  ranks  piti- 
fully ;  and  the  survivors  keep  more  and  more  aloof,  until  it 
seems  as  if  an  absolute  change  in  the  bird's  range  will  be 
the  result. 

Muskeget  Island,  northeast  of  Nantucket,  is  a  breeding- 
place  for  these  Terns,  as  well  as  many  other  Water-birds, 
and  there  is  a  guardian  on  the  island  to  see  that  they  are 
protected,  especially  in  the  breeding-season.  A  friend  who 
visited  Muskeget  last  July,  told  me  that  everywhere  on  the 
sand  there  were  eggs  in  groups  of  two  and  three,  and  young 
Terns  in  various  stages  of  growth,  who  were  so  tame  that 
they  allowed  him  to  handle  them  as  readily  as  kittens.  The 
heat  of  the  sun  keeps  the  eggs  warm  in  the  daytime,  and  as 
soon  as  they  are  hatched  the  young  birds  go  down  to  the 
water's  edge  and  feed  upon  a  glutinous  substance  that  is 
washed  up.  The  adults  go  in  enormous  flocks  to  Nantucket 
every  morning  and  spend  the  day  in  the  harbour  and  little 
bays,  feeding  upon  the  wastage  of  the  island,  returning  to 
Muskeget  at  dusk. 

Roseate  Tern :   Sterna  dougalli. 

Length :  14-15  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Bill  black,  yellow  at  tip,  and  reddish  at  base. 

Black  cap,  and  long  head  feathers ;  back  of  neck  white,  also 

entire  under  parts  white  with  a  rosy  wash.   Wings  varied,  gray, 

tail  pearl-gray.     Feet  and  legs  yellowish  red. 
Season  :  A  rare  summer  resident. 
Breeds :  Casually  along  the  Atlantic  coast  to  Maine. 
Bange :  Temperate  and  tropical  regions,  north  on  the  Atlantic  coast  of 

North  America  to  Massachusetts,  and  casually  to  Maine. 

A  rarely  beautiful  species,  not  often  seen  north  of  New 
England,  but  breeding  with  the  Common  Tern  at  Muskeget, 
and  hardly  daring  to  show  its  rosy  breast  to  the  vandals

in  unprotected  lands.  I  quote  the  following,  relative  to 
the  protection  of  these  birds,  from  Mr.  F.  M.  Chapman: 
"  Through  the  efforts  of  a  number  of  bird-lovers,  who  raised 
a  sum  of  money  for  the  purpose,  permission  has  been 
obtained  from  the  Lighthouse  Board  to  have  the  light-keeper 
on  Little  Gull  Island  appointed  ji  special  game-keeper, 
whose  duty  it  shall  be  to  protect  the  Terns  on  Great  Gull 
Island.'^  A  few  days  later,  in  reading  a  copy  of  Our 
Animal  Friends  for  December,  1894  (the  humanizing  monthly 
magazine  of  the  American  Society  for  the  Prevention  of 
Cruelty  to  Animals),  I  saw  the  ensuing  statement,  which 
supplements  Mr.  Chapman's  very  opportunely :  — 

"  We  have  received  a  report  from  Mr.  Dutcher,^  which  lies 
before  us  and  contains  much  interesting  information.  Mr. 
Dutcher  says:  'I  take  pleasure  in  reporting  that,  during 
the  season  of  1894,  protection  was  given  to  the  colony  of 
Terns  on  Great  Gull  Island,  Kew  York,  during  the  breeding- 
season.  In  1886  the  island  was  visited,  and  a  colony  of  from 
three  to  four  thousand  Terns  was  found  there,  but  it  was  a 
common  practice  for  persons  to  visit  the  island  and  shoot 
the  birds,  taking  the  eggs  for  various  purposes,  principally, 
however,  for  eating.  Subsequently  it  was  ascertained  that 
the  colony  was  decreasing  year  by  year,  and  the  necessity 
of  protection  became  apparent  if  it  was  not  to  be  entirely 
destroyed,  as  many  others  have  been  on  the  Long  Island 
coast.'  In  a  letter,  dated  October  4,  Captain  Field  reports 
the  result  of  one  single  year's  protection  to  be  most  satis- 
factory. The  increase  of  the  Tern  colony  at  the  close  of 
the  season  is  estimated  to  have  been  from  one  thousand  to 
fifteen  hundred  birds,  or,  in  other  words,  the  colony  has 
been  increased  by  one-half."

SWIMMING  BIRDS.  Doveklo 

Least  Tern:    Sterna  antillarutn* 

Length :  9  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Legs  and  bill  yellow.    Crown  black ;  black  wings  ; 

tail,  and  rump  gull-blue.    A  few  outer  wing  feathers  black; 

below  white. 
Season :  A  migrant,  formerly  a  summer  resident  along  the  Atlantic 

coast. 
Breeds :  Casually  through  its  range. 
Bange :  Northern  South  America  northward  to  California  and  New 

England  and  casually  to  Labrador. 

The  smallest  of  the  Terns,  living  upon  fish  and  insects. 
It  flocks  about  inland  waters  as  well  as  on  the  Atlantic  and 
some  parts  of  the  Pacific  coast.  It  is  a  rather  southerly- 
species,  but  was  once  a  common  summer  resident  along  the 
eastern  shore.  Its  eggs  are  laid  in  ^the  sand  like  those  of 
other  species,  and  differ  from  them  in  sometimes  having  the 
spots  wreathed  around  the  larger  end,  while  the  smaller  is 
almost  plain. 


ORDER  PYGOPODES :  DIVING  BIRDS. 

FAMILY  ALCID^:    AUKS,  PUFFINS,   MURRES,  ETC. 
Dovekie;  Alle  alle» 

Sea  Dove;  Little  Auk. 

Length :  8-9  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Short,  thick,  black  bill.    Above  dark  brown  with 

some  white  on  wings ;  below  generally  whitish. 
Season :  A  winter  migrant  of  varying  rarity. 
Breeds :  In  the  Arctic  regions. 
Bange :  Coasts  and  islands  of  the  North  Atlantic  and  eastern  Arctic 

oceans  ;  in  winter  North  America  south  to  New  Jersey. 

An  off-shore  bird  of  heavy  build  and  singular  appear- 
ance, to  be  seen  about  lighthouses  and  barren  bits  of  coast 
from  New  Jersey  north.  It  is  properly  a  coastwise  bird, 
but  there  are  accounts  of  its  being  driven  far  inland  by 
storms.

Loona  SWIMMING  BIRDS. 

FAMILY  URINATORID^:    LOONS. 
liOon :    Urinator  imher. 

Great  Northern  Diver, 

Plate  78. 

Length:  31-36  inches. 

Male  and  Female:  Head,  throat,  and  neck  iridescent  green,  blue» 
and  purplish.  Triangular  patches  of  black  and  white  streaks 
on  either  side  of  the  throat,  almost  joining  at  the  back  and  nar- 
rowing in  front.  Above  spotted  black  and  white.  Breast 
streaked  on  sides  with  black  and  white;  under  parts  white. 
Bill  dark  yellowish  green. 

Season :  Winter  resident ;  most  common,  however,  in  the  migrations 
September  to  May. 

Breeds :  Northward  from  the  northern  tier  of  States. 

Bange:  Northern  part  of  Northern  Hemisphere;  ranges,  in  winter, 
south  to  the  Gulf  of  Mexico. 

This  Loon  appears  here  more  as  a  wandering  visitor  than 
a  winter  resident,  for  those  who  remain  after  the  general 
migration  are  constantly  shifting  about.  Its  plumage  is 
very  rich  and  velvety,  though,  as  in  the  case  of  so  many 
Water-birds  which  we  see  only  in  the  autumn  and  winter, 
the  fully  plumed  adult  males  are  in  the  minority,  and  the 
more  dully  feathered  young  predominate. 

The  Loon  dives  and  swims  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Grebes.  It  only  inhabits  the  interior  while  the  lakes  and 
rivers  remain  unfrozen. 

Red-throated  liOon:    Urinator  lutnme. 

Length :  25  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Blue-gray  forehead,  chin,  upper  throat,  and  sides 
of  head ;  crown  and  general  upper  parts  dull  black,  with  a 
glossy  greenish  wash  and  streaked  and  mottled  with  white.  A 
triangle  of  rusty  red  on  the  front  of  neck.  White  below.  Bill 
black. 

Season :  Winter  resident ;  fairly  common. 

Breeds  :  In  high  latitudes. 

Bange :  Northern  part  of  Northern  Hemisphere ;  migrating  southward 
in  winter,  nearly  across  the  United  States.

SWIMMING  BIRDS.  Grebes 

Smaller  than  the  Great  Diver,  having  a  reddish  brown 
throat  patch  as  a  mark  of  identification,  which,  however,  is 
lacking  in  the  young  of  the  year.  This  Red-throated  Loon 
is  the  species  most  usually  seen  here,  but  it  is  neither  a  par- 
ticularly handsome  or  conspicuous  bird. 

FAMILY  PODICIPID^:    GREBES. 
Horned  Grebe  :  Colymhus  auritus. 


Length :  14  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  In  spring,  prominent  crests  forming  two  yellow- 
brown  horns  ;  rest  of  head  puffy  and  glossy  black.  Above  dark 
brown,  with  edgings  of  gray  and  black.  Neck,  upper  breast, 
and  sides  rusty  brown ;  some  white  on  wings.  Young  without 
horns  ;  neck  and  lower  parts  whitish.  Bill  black,  with  yellow 
tip. 

Season  :  A  winter  resident,  and  a  plentiful  migrant  in  spring  and  fall. 

Breeds :  North  from  the  northern  United  States. 

Nest  and  Eggs  :  The  buffy  white  eggs  are  deposited  on  decayed  reed- 
beds,  and  sometimes  on  floating  masses  of  reeds. 

Bange :  Northern  Hemisphere. 

These  curiously  constructed  birds  are  expert  swimmers, 
but  very  helpless  on  land.  They  have  no  tails  to  speak 
of,  and  in  the  breeding-season  wear  variously  feathered 
head-dresses  which  give  them  a  ludicrous  appearance,  and 
make  them  veritable  caricatures.  But  if  you  presume  upon 
this  apparent  stupidity,  and  try  to  approach  them,  you  will 
be  very  much  surprised  at  the  speed  with  which  they  slip 
from  the  shore  and  dive  out  of  sight ;  not  with  a  splash, 
but  sinking  like  lead,  and  escaping  by  swimming  under 
water,  with  the  head  alone  visible.  When  inhabiting  the 
coast  the  Grebes  live  upon  fish,  but  when  inland  they  sub- 
sist upon  fresh-water  newts,  frogs,  insects,  and  sometimes 
the  seeds  of  grasses.

Pied-billed  Grebe :  Podilymhus  podiceps. 

Dipper;  DabcMck. 

Plate  79.     Fig.  2. 

Length :  13  inches. 

Male  and  Female :  Some  bristling  frontal  feathers,  but  no  regular 
horns.  Above  dark  brown,  showy  black  markings  on  chin  and 
throat.  Breast  and  lower  throat  yellowish  brown,  irregularly 
spotted  and  barred,  on  the  upper  parts,  lower  parts  glossy 
white.  Wings  brown,  gray,  and  white.  Bill  spotted  with  blue, 
white,  and  dusky,  and  crossed  by  a  black  band,  hence  Pied- 
billed. 

Season :  Common  migrant,  on  Housatonic  River  in  September  and 
October. 

Breeds :  Through  range. 

Nesting :  Habits  similar  to  the  last  species. 

Bange :  British  Provinces,  southward  to  Brazil,  Buenos  Ayres,  and 
Chili,  including  the  West  Indies  and  the  Bermudas. 

The  most  common  Grebe  on  the  eastern  coast,  and,  though, 
said  to  breed  through  its  range,  is  not  noted  as  a  resident 
hereabout.  It  frequents  fresh  water,  even  more  freely  than 
salt,  and  Dr.  Langdon  gives  an  interesting  account  of  its 
inland  breeding-habits  in  his  "Summer  Birds  in  an  Ohio 
Marsh  " :  "  The  little  floating  island  of  decaying  vegetation, 
held  together  by  mud  and  moss,  which  constitutes  the  nest 
of  this  species,  is  a  veritable  ornithological  curiosity. 
Imagine  a  ^  pancake '  of  what  appears  to  be  mud,  measuring 
twelve  or  fifteen  inches  in  diameter,  and  rising  two  or  three 
inches  above  the  water,  which  may  be  from  one  to  three  feet 
in  depth;  anchor  it  to  the  bottom  with  a  few  concealed 
blades  of  *  saw  grass,'  in  a  little  open  bay,  leaving  its  cir- 
cumference  entirely  free;  remove  a  mass  of  wet  muck  from 
its  rounded  top,  and  you  expose  seven  or  eight  soiled, 
brownish  white  eggs,  resting  in  a  depression,  the  bottom  of 
which  is  less  than  an  inch  from  the  water ;  the  whole  mass 
is  constantly  damp.  This  is  the  nest  of  the  Dabchick,  who 
is  out  foraging  in  the  marsh,  or,  perhaps,  is  anxiously 
watching  us  from  some  safe  corner  near  by.  .  .  .    During

the  day  we  invariably  found  the  eggs  concealed  by  a  cover- 
ing of  muck  as  above  described ;  but  as  we  ascertained  by 
repeated  visits  at  night,  and  in  the  early  morning,  they  are  un- 
covered at  dusk  by  the  bird,  who  incubates  them  until  the 
morning  sun  relieves  her  of  her  task."

AND  FLOWERS. 

By  MABEL  OSGOOD  WRIGHT.

"A  charming  chronicle  it  is,  abounding  in  excellent  descrip- 
tions and  interesting  comment." —  Chicago  Evening  Journal. 

"The  author  sees  and  vividly  describes  what  she  sees.  But 
more,  she  has  rare  insight  and  sees  deeply,  and  the  most  precious 
things  lie  deep."  —  Boston  Daily  Advertiser. 

"  There  is  much  of  the  feeling  of  Henry  D.  Thoreau  between 
the  covers  of  this  book,  and  the  expression  is  characterized  by  a 
poetic  appreciation  of  the  value  of  word-combination  which  is 
admirable."  —  Philadelphia  Evening  Bulletin. 

"  A  delightful  little  book  .  .  .  which  brings  one  into  intimate 
acquaintance  with  nature,  the  wild  flowers,  the  fields,  and  the 
brooks."  —  Springfield  Union. 

"  Thoroughly  delightful  reading."  —  Boston  Courier. 

"A  very  clever  little  book.  It  .  .  .  takes  us  through  a  New 
England  year,  describing  the  birds,  flowers,  and  woods  in  a  most 
poetical  and  delightful  mood."  —  Detroit  Free  Press.

THE 

Beauties  of  Nature 

AND  THE  WONDERS  OF  THE  WORLD 
WE   LIVE  IN. 

By  The  Right  Hon.  Sir  JOHN  LUBBOCK,  Bart.,  M.P., 
F.R.S.,  D.C.L.,  LL.D. 

Cloth,  gilt  top.    12ino.    $1.50. 


*'  We  know  of  none  other  better  fitted  to  present  '  the  beauties  of  nature  and 
the  wonders  of  the  world  we  live  in,'  to  the  popular  understanding  and  appreci- 
ation than  Sir  John  Lubbock,  who  is  at  once  a  master  of  his  chosen  topic  and  of 
a  diction  unsurpassed  for  clearness  and  simplicity  of  statement.  It  is  a  volume 
which  the  reading  public  will  recognize  and  hail  immediately  as  among  the  most 
delightfully  instructive  of  the  year's  production  in  books.  There  is  matter  in 
it  for  the  young  and  the  mature  mind.  .  .  .  One  cannot  rise  from  the  perusal 
of  this  volume,  without  a  consciousness  of  a  mind  invigorated  and  permanently 
enriched  by  an  acquaintance  with  it." —  Oswego  Daily  Times. 

"  It  is  a  charming  book.  .  .  .  Few  writers  succeed  In  making  natural  history, 
and  indeed  scientific  subjects,  more  than  interesting.  In  the  hands  of  most 
authors  they  are  intolerably  dull  to  the  general  reader  and  especially  to  children. 
Sir  John  Lubbock  makes  his  theme  as  entrancing  as  a  novel.  .  .  .  The  book 
is  magnificently  illustrated,  and  discusses  the  wonders  of  the  animal,  mineral, 
and  vegetable  kingdoms,  the  marvels  of  earth,  sea,  and  the  vaulted  heavens.  In 
the  compass  of  its  pages  an  immense  amount  of  knowledge  which  all  should 
know  is  given  in  a  manner  that  will  compel  the  child  who  commences  it  to 
pursue  it  to  the  end.  It  is  a  work  which  cannot  be  too  highly  recommended 
to  parents  who  have  at  heart  the  proper  education  of  their  children."  —  The 
Arena. 

"We  have  here  a  rich  store  of  information  told  in  the  charming  style  for 
which  the  distinguished  author  is  famous.  It  is  suited  alike  to  the  scientific  and 
the  unscientific  reader.  The  wonders  of  animal,  especially  of  insect,  life,  of 
plant  life,  of  woods  and  fields,  of  mountains,  of  rivers,  of  lakes,  of  the  sea  and 
of  the  starry  heavens,  are  here  delightfully  described,  and  they  are  marvellous 
indeed.  ...  It  is  a  good  book  to  kindle  m  the  reader  a  love  of  nature.  .  .  . 
There  is  not  a  dry  or  dull  page  in  the  book."  —  The  Western  Recorder. 

"  We  find  nothing  to  criticise  and  everything  to  enjoy.  .  .  .  The  unpreten- 
tious method  and  the  simplicity  of  the  style  will  attract  even  a  child,  and  the 
whole  book  has  a  winning  power.  .  .  .  The  author  is  copious  in  information, 
suggestive  in  profound  thought,  and  so  clear  and  forcible  in  style  that  man  or 
girl  or  boy  can  enjoy  his  every  page."  —  The  Literary  World.
