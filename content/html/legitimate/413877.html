I have been trying to contact the Citi Master Cards in Canada. they have been doing me too much harm. It shows on my credit report that I still owe them couple thousand dollars. but the payment was made in full in 2007. Citi Bank never contacted me about this. It seems like they did not update my credit agency. Looked for the numbers online with no luck. Thanks for your help.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>A week ago my computer was hit with a malware PC Defender, that does all kinds of things and requires a payment to clear it out, like Blackmail. When I discovered this PC Defender was not good I called citi and the person I talked with said no withdraw had been made as yet but he could see it pending? He said nothing could be done yet but watch my account and when the withdraw was made call citi to work it out.<br />
I did this and when the draw was posted I called citi today April 18, I was informed that I had to contact the PC Defender people to request they give a deposit. Of course because PC defender is malware you cant contact them on email or phone.  I think citi should be able to sto payment when requested. Also I was informed that if this PC Defender company made another withdrawel it would be honered, there is nothing I could do about it. Even if I cancelled my card or changd the number?</p>

    <div class="submitted">On January 6th, 2010 NameLess (not verified) says:</div>
    <div class="content"><p>Just received a call from CityBanks collection agent from the following Tel Number: 1-866-902-3676. The very first words of of this lady's mouth was that we are loosers, irresponsible. and should  be very careful because the very precious house we have we will be loosing it. I explained to her that she was being very unprofessional, I've explained not one but many times that I lost my job and trying to make ends meet. I pay as much as I possible can and hoping to be able to get a job very soon. I'm out at interviews with placement agencies pretty much on a daliy basis. She kept on not telling but yelling at me all kinds of profanitikes and then hung up.  I redialed her number and sure enough she answered  - I told her that someone in her position is supposed to be helping people and then she started yelling that I refused her help and that I should get a job and get some money because she's taking my house. I interupted her and told her that I will ensure to call her Manager and report her behaviour at one, she hung up on me. As I was looking up their customer service line I was provided with their Collection Agencies Phone # 1-800-276-1475. I called them and a gentlemen answered the call. I asked for the Manager and he stalled - he then asked what was the purpose of my call. I explained to him that I needed to speak with the Manager regarding a call I just received. Now without giving any info this man immediately asked if I was calling regarding the account in the name of (). Of course call display would give it away but then he explained that the Manager was nopt available and that I may leave a message of call back in a few hours. Well he did transfer me and of course there was no voice mail simply a busy signal. This just goes to show the lack of professionalism TCH has.<br />
I believe it's important for CityBank to know that they are dealing with rude and unprofessional people that will do nothing but reflect very bad on CityBank.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Citi Mastercard sent my name to collections for $2.33 which I was unaware I owed!!! Get this, they sent me to collections on September 19th but yet sent me a statement in the mail stating that "Minimum Payment Due" for $2.33 on October 8,2009. I am floored, not to mention extremely embarrassed to be sent to collections for a measly $2.33, when I have never been sent to collections in my life! I am absolutely infuriated! When I asked how come I wasn't given a Courtesy Phone Call to make me aware that I had a balance owing - she responded with "that's why they are "courtesy" phone calls, because they are courtesy and not required!! You just imagine!  The Rep with Citi Mastercard proceeded to tell me that they did a "Courtesy Write Off" for the $2.33 balance and I didn't owe it anymore but they also did a "Courtesy Collection Report on My Name" as well.... so small! So basically they paid off what I owe out of Courtesy but still sent my name to collections!!! Thanks for the courtesy Citi Mastercard!! Needless to say - I am going to the bank right now to pay off my $2.33 balance owing - and no longer have a Citi Mastercard! Seriously... I almost wish I had a case against them because this is definitely something I would pursue! All for $2.33. Gone to collections... ughhhh Thanks Citi Mastercard!!!!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I mistakenly made a huge payment to an expired citibank mastercard via online banking.  I called my bank the next day when I caught it, who in turn contacted citibank, who said I had to contact them to reverse it.  The bank passed this info on to me and I contacted citibank immediately.  They said it would be refunded within 3 - 5 business days.  It has now been 49 days, numerous calls and numerous hours on the phone, and numerous promises from citibank and I have yet to receive a penny.  They can't even find the entire amount!!!  It is a nightmare.  DO NOT USE THIS BANK OR CREDIT CARD.</p>
