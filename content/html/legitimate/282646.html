				<B>Paris - </B> It is reported that the above problem, by the distinguished Finnish composer Unto Heinonen has been computer tested on Thursday May third in less than 10 minutes.
				This surprising performance, altough executed on a powerful PC running Windows 98 at 1.3Ghz under 128Mb of memory is reportedly the feat of a new software.
				Reliable sources have been able to give us a few supplementary facts about the program.
			</TD></TR>
			<TR><TD STYLE = "text-align: justify;">
				Titled <EM>Euclide</EM>, from the alleged Greek author of <EM>Les &eacute;l&eacute;ments</EM>, an outstanding treatise of geometry displaying great deduction skills from its author(s), the program is currently available in <FONT FACE = "Symbol">b</FONT>eta version somewhere on Internet.
				The author, whose name is yet unknown, seems to be interested only in the underlying algorithm since we have been told that the program is not much flexible in terms of memory usage and options.
				Rumors talk of a hefty 56Mb of memory!
				One of our source even discredits the author for he perceived the user interface as a mere revamp of <A HREF = "http://natch.free.fr/">Natch</A>'s one. 				  												  			
			</TD></TR>
			<TR><TD STYLE = "text-align: justify;">
				Pascal Wassong recently admitted to a friend that these persistent rumors gave him fresh motivation to further improve his already excellent program.
				In conclusion, we think that whether <EM>Euclide</EM> is real or is only a rumor, it certainly will have a positive impact on computer problem solving.

Try it, it's free!
Click the above link to download a setup program [425k] containing the full program.

System requirements:<OL>
	<LI STYLE = "text-align: justify;">
	Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP/Vista/Seven. <EM>Euclide</EM> is in fact a Win32 Console application, hence it runs in a DOS window.
	The code can be downloaded and compiled for <B>Linux</B> or <B>Mac OS X</B>.
	See the <A HREF="euclide.html">documentation</A> for details on how to do that.
	<LI STYLE = "text-align: justify;">
	64Mb of memory. Can Win 95 run on less anyway? However, <EM>Euclide</EM> consumes 56Mb of memory, and will slow down considerably if the computer starts swapping.
	Hence 96Mb is probably a more realistic requirement if you wish to use the computer while <EM>Euclide</EM> is working.
