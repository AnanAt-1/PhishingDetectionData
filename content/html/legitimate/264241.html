I originally got interested in stereograms in early 1994,
at which time much discussion took place in Usenet newsgroup <b>alt.3d</b>.
Back then I wrote some fairly basic programs to draw single image random dot
stereograms (SIRDS), but was disappointed to find that the poor resolution
of a typical computer monitor put a severe limitation on the depth
resolution that could be obtained - typically 10 discrete levels per inch.
I then found I could smooth off the steps between the levels, a significant
aesthetic improvement, by implementing a form of anti-aliassing, but a
side-effect was a very mild ghost-like quality to some areas of the 3D
scene. I tried to convince myself then that given a high-resolution medium,
really smooth and solid stereograms could quite easily be made.
<p>
In early 1995, with renewed interest and convenient access to a laser
printer, I turned my thoughts to stereograms once again. It was then that I
discovered the major problem with RDS: a pattern of random dots 600 to the
inch looks like a pretty even grey mass. To overcome this I had a quick go
at printing larger dots but positioning them to 600dpi. The picture was then
visible, but the size of the dots were limiting the resolution in the x- and
y-directions, and the high contrast was very harsh.
<p>
This was the end of the line for SIRDS. Random dots just weren't going to do the
trick. I needed to replace the random dots with a <b>pattern</b> which has both
large-scale structure to aid easy convergence and small scale detail to
convey even subtle 3D depth information.
<p>
About April time, soon after I began working on stereograms with patterns,
Chris Watkins contacted me about doing a contribution on that very topic for
his new book, "Stereogram Programming Techniques". As a consequence my
stereogram progression went turbo-charged (despite my having exams in May);
I succeeded in writing a good working algorithm and completed a satisfactory
write-up by the deadline for the book at the end of May.

You'll be glad to know my exams went well despite the obvious distraction
(with hindsight that was probably one of the most stressful periods of my
life!), and I was able to spend a few weeks afterwards tidying up the
stereogram programs at a more leisurely pace. Over the summer I worked
(among other things) on developing a proper user-interface for my programs,
hence SISGen was born.
<p>
Key features of my software are:
<ul> 
<li>Hidden-surface removal at a respectable (ok, blisteringly fast!) speed.</li>
<li>Complete absence of artifacts - no more false 'echoes' in the image.</li>
<li>Really smooth 3D images even on ordinary low-resolution monitors.</li>
<li>A from-the-centre-outwards approach of applying the pattern
to give a more balanced overall appearance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the summer I was asked by the Alembic group at the University Twente,
Holland, if I could make them a stereogram of the 60-carbon atom
Buckminsterfullerine (buckyball) molecule for a poster advertising their
conference in the autumn. It turned out to be a good test of any stereogram
algorithm - and revealed a couple of minor flaws in my program, which
were then fixed.
<p>
Since then I have periodically returned to SISGen with minor improvements,
mainly speedups. The result is that 640x480-pixel stereograms in 256 colours
(with 2x oversampling for smoothness) can now be drawn in under 20 seconds
in Windows even on an ageing 20MHz 486sx computer. Larger pictures, e.g. A4
size at 135dpi (1400x1000 pixels) take around a minute. On a Pentium 90, the
stereograms can be created in just a couple of seconds.
<p>
More recently I have completed a set of stereograms for a small company in
Oregon (USA) which makes collectable kaleidoscopes. They have since shown an
interest in poster-sized stereograms, and I now have the capability to
create stereograms up to 5000 pixels wide (10 to 20Mb files!). With a few
more hours adapting the code, the remaining limitations could be removed,
leaving only the free space on my hard disk as the final constraint!
<br clear=right>
<p>
Owing to the file sizes involved, it would be unreasonable (and impractical)
to exhibit the full detail of my large, high-resolution stereograms here.
<p>
The January 1997 edition of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mind/">Microsoft
Interactive Developer Magazine</a> featured an article on
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mind/0197/sirds/sirds.htm">
stereogram programming using Java</a>, which was heavily based on
my C programs.
