<P>This page and the pages it links to refer to Feng Shui the Role
Playing Game, not Feng Shui, the art of arranging your living space to
provide a healthful and fortunate living environment.  Feng Shui is a
role playing game based on Hong Kong action movies, and it exists in
the same multiverse as the collectable card game
<A HREF="/games/RPGs/shadowfist/">Shadowfist</A>.  These pages assume some
knowledge of the game and its background.  A short index of existing
pages is listed below:</P>

<H3><A NAME="drinking">Alcohol Impairment</A></H3>

<P>In Feng Shui, a drink of alcohol will cause -1 impairment
per drink for 6 hours.  I find this at variance with real life and
with action movies.  Since injury just short of death causes only
a -2 impairment, I fail to see how having a 3 glasses of wine over
the course of an evening can cause worse impairment than being
in a car accident and shot several times.</P>

<P>According to the Drivers Education course I took in high
school, an average person will metabolize one drink every hour. 
DMV Blood Alcohol charts and tests indicate that 1-2 drinks
does not cause impairment, 3-4 will cause reflex loss, but no other
noticeable effect on coordination and 5+ drinks are dangerous. 
This is for a 160 lb person.  My personal experience (mostly
gained in college) matches this analysis.

<P>My house rule is that you can take drinks up to 1/3 your Con
without impairment, up to 2/3 at -1, up to 1x your Con at -2 and an
additional -1 for each 1/3 of Con above that.. At levels higher than
your con, you must make a Con check at difficulty 0 to avoid
passing out. Each hour the PC can eliminate the effect of one
drink.</P>

<P>This means Joe Normal with 6 body can drink about 12 drinks
in one hour before being at serious risk to pass out.  He will be at
impairment -5, which is pretty harsh.  This matches my personal
experience.  Other nasty side effects such as throwing up can be
if the con roll is between 1 and 3.  Hangovers will happen if it is
cinematic to do so.</P>

<P>The only Feng Shui rule regarding drinking that I like is that
Beer only counts as half a drink for all impairment purposes.  That
fits my view of cinematic drinking.</P>

<H3><A NAME="guns">Gun Decisions</A></H3>

<H4>Fast Draw</H4>

<P>I think the Fast Draw in the rules is fine but should have
been called something else.  I allow an additional schtick
Lightning Draw, which allows the PC to switch weapons at no
shot cost.<P>

<H4>Panic Fire</H4>

<P>My old Traveller game had a rule which allows a PC
to empty his clip and target more victims.  The autofire
rules in Feng Shui are good if you are trying to shoot a lot
of bullets into one person, but do not simulate the massive
amounts of property damage caused by emptying a clip to try
to hit the hero who is dodging like heck.<P>

<P>My rules allow Panic Fire, which is sort of Aiming in 
reverse.  Panic Fire can be done with any gun, not just
automatic weapons.  Panic Fire provides a +2 AV bonus, but
normally requires 5 shots of time before anything else can be
done.  It has the following penalties:</P>

<UL>
<LI>You must empty your clip.
<BR>(therefore losing a shot to switch weapons or reload)
<LI>Panic Fire is a 4 shot action.
<LI>Automatic weapons jam on double 1's.
<LI>Other weapons require a Will roll of 5+ to avoid dry-firing
the weapon for a shot after the ammo runs out.
<BR>  (Ahhhhhhh! BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM click click click click...)
<LI>You are encouraged to mime the action.
</UL>

<P>You can buy the Gun Schtick "Hail of Bullets" which eliminates 
most of the penalties.  One schtick can make Panic Fire a 3 shot action.  One
schtick can remove the jamming & dry firing penalties.  One shtick can
allow the gunman to fire non-automatic weapons as if they were automatic
for the purposes of doing more damage to a target.  The three schticks
can be bought in any order.  Lightning Reload is helpful.</P>

<P>You can not combine aiming with any form of Panic Fire, even with
the schtick "Hail of Bullets".</P>

<H3><A NAME="fupowers">Fu Power Decisions</A></H3>

<P>This section is redundant with information provided
on my <A HREF="/games/RPGs/fengshui/fupower">Fu Power
Analysis</A> page.  It contains only rulings, not
power analysis or the reasons for the rulings.</P>

<H4>Drunken Stance</H4>

<P> The first Drunken Stance schtick can be used on
almost any skill (driving, guns, medicine), and
additional schticks can be bought for overcoming
penalties for additional skills. However, you still
have to do something strange to indicate that you are
channeling Chi with your fu powers.</P>

<P>See also <A HREF="#drinking">Alcohol Impairment</A>.</P>

<H4>Flying Sword</H4>

<P>I allow a separate schtick "Thunder Kick" to be
bought, which is exactly the same as Flying Sword
except that the attack must be a Kick, not a Sword
strike.</P>

<H4>Old Master Unique Schtick with Fu Powers</H4>

<P>The FAQ says that Old Masters do not do +6 damage
with bare handed attacks if they are using Fu powers. 
I like Old Masters to be as terrifying as possible,
since they are forced to have a 4 body, have no choice
of skills and have only Leadership as a useful
non-combat non-info skill. Therefore my house rules
give Old Masters +6 damage with bare handed attacks,
if the Fu power says anything like "do a martial arts
attack", or "+n to your damage".  If the Fu power says
STR+n damage, the unique Schtick does not apply.
</P>

<H4>Water Sword</H4>

<P>In my game, the Water Sword dodge penalty works on
one opponent at a time.  A new display maneuver must
be done (and chi paid) before applying the dodge
penalty to a new opponent.</P>

<H4>Other Fu Power Rulings</H4>

<P>In Fu Power descriptions, the word "Dodge" means
Dodge or Parry if the Fu Power is an attack.  If
the Fu power is a defense, it means "Dodge", but can
be bought separately for "Parry".</P>

<P>In Fu Power descriptions, the word "Gun" means 
Guns or Bows/Crossbows.</P>
