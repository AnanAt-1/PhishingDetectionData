Who  wrote  these  lines  in  a  little  girl's  album : 

"Think  of  your  grandma,  Emma, 

When  she  is  far  away. 
Recall  our  walks  together 

And  our  amusing  play, 
When  I  was  the  prim  hostess 

And  you  the  charming  guest 
Whose  children  were  so  very  sick — 

Baby  and  all  the  rest."

This  little  unambitious  book  does  not  pretend  to  be 
a  real  genealogy,  but  merely  a  record  of  the  descendants 
of  Daniel  Clark,  as  found  in  our  archives,  in  the  replies 
to  numerous  letters  of  inquiry  and  in  such  family  and 
county  books  as  were  available.  It  is  hoped  that  some 
one  better  qualified  for  the  work  may  take  it  up  some 
day  and,  in  adding  to  it,  correct  such  errors  as  have  crept 
in  in  spite  of  our  care.  For  omissions  we  are  sorry,  but 
place  the  blame  upon  the  large  number  who  did  not  reply 
to  letters,  or  failed  to  keep  sufficiently  in  touch  with 
the   familv  to  let  their  present  addresses  be  known. 

The  name  Clark  was  spelled  with  and  without  an  'V 
on  the  old  records,  but  the  signature  of  the  settler  is  with- 
out, in  everv  case  we  have  found,  so  we  have  written  it 
that  way.  As  far  as  possible  the  letter  has  been  given 
to  those  families  accustomed  to  use  it.  This  has  been 
at  times  difficult,  since  brothers  and.  sisters  have  not 
agreed  on  the  subject,  but  we  have  followed  the  usage  of 
each  correspondent. 

Where  there  have  been  differences  in  dates,  etc.,  we 
have  followed  the  testimony  of  the  greater  number, 
whether  on  public  or  private  records. 

Grateful  acknowledgment  is  due  Mrs.  Harriette  Clarke 
Sprague  of  Dowagiac,  Michigan,  for  her  valuable  assist- 
ance, to  Celestine  Forstall  for  the  original  records  of 
the  family,  and  to  various  other  members  of  the  Clarke 
family  who  have  so  courteously  replied  to  our  requests  for 
notes  and  anecdotes.  To  Edwin  Clarke  of  Quincy,  111., 
we  owe  the  entire  project,  as  it  was  made  possible  be- 
cause he  had  for  some  years  kept  a  close  and  accurate 


PREFACE 

record  of  those  ot  die  Clark  family  of  whom  he  knew, 
or  from  time  to  time  heard.  Mrs.  Frank  E.  Clark  of 
Hebron,  Ct.,  has  been  a  most  valued  aid  not  only  in  her 
children's  line  but  in  the  lines  of  others  and  in  historical 
'research.  Miss  Alice  Gay  of  Hartford  has  also  been 
of  great  assistance. 

We  do  not  present  the  Clark  coat-of-arms,  because  we 
lack  authority  for  it,  but  the  one  handed  down  in  one 
family  is  given  :  Sable,  a  mullet  of  six  points,  pierced, 
or,  within  a  bordure  argent,  charged  with  three  cross 
crosslets,  fitchee  of  the  field.  Crest :  A  mullet  of  six 
points  argent.    Motto  :   Animo  et  scientia.

HONORABLE  DANIEL  CLARK  OF  WINDSOR, 

CONNECTICUT 


\J 


HONORABLE  DANIEL  CLARK  OF  WINDSOR, 

CONNECTICUT 

In  1639,  when  he  was  seventeen  years  old,  Daniel 
Clark  of  Weaxil  (near  Kenilworth),  England,  came  to 
America  with  his  uncle,  Rev.  Ephraim  Hint,  who  became 
pastor  of  Old  Windsor's  Congregational  Society,  as  a 
colleague  of  Rev.  John  Wareham.  On  June  13,  1644, 
Daniel  Clark  married  Mary  Newberry,  daughter  of 
Thomas  and  Jane  Newberry,  who  came  to  America  in 
the  "Alary  and  John,"  1630.  Thomas  Newberry  had  two 
brothers  among  Cromwell's  Dragoons,  and  was  descended 
from  William  Newberry,  "Chronicler  of  his  District." 
To  William  Newberry  was  accorded  the  honor,  granted 
to  but  one  man  in  a  town,  of  adopting  as  his  surname 
the  name  of  the  town  where  he  resided.  Thomas  New- 
berry died  in  1635  and  his  widow  married  the  Rev.  John 
Wareham,  thus  becoming  for  the  second  time  ancestress 
of  many  of  the  Clarks. 

Tradition  states  that  Daniel  Clark  went  home  after  he 
had  been  here  some  years,  overcome  bv  a  lon^ingf  to  see 
his  people  and  his  old  haunts.  He  knocked  at  his  par- 
ents' door  pretending  to  be  a  stranger  from  America,  and 
as  such  was  made  welcome,  their  pleasure  in  his  coming 
being  doubled  when  the}'  found  him  to  be  from  Con- 
necticut and  acquainted  with  their  son.  It  was  Martha, 
his  sister,  who  at  length  discovered  the  fraud  and  cried 
out  that  their  Daniel  had  come  home  at  last. 

Daniel  Clark  held  many  offices  in  the  colony.  In  1654 
he  was  tax  assessor,  appearing  on  the  second  tax  list 
himself  as  having  a  "Family  horse  and  two  oxen,"     He 


l6  CI. ARK    GENEALOGY 

was  Representative  from  1657  to  1661,  Secretary  of  the 
Colony,  1658  to  1662,  member  of  the  Court  of  Assistants, 
1662-4,  Commissioner,  1662,  and  Captain  of  the  Colonial 
Troops,  1664.  He  was  made  Attorney  in  the  Andrus 
Court  at  Hartford  March,  1687,  was  a  member  of  the 
Particular  Court,  a  Deputy,  Clerk  of  the  County  Court, 
Member  of  the  Committee  to  appoint  and  commission 
officers  of  the  militia,  one  of  the  nineteen  signers  and 
grantees  of  the  Charter  of  Connecticut,  a  member  of  the 
Committee  to  Advise  the  Indians,  a  member  of  the  church, 
1634,  Recorder,  1658,  and  a  member  of  numerous  other 
committees  on  which  he  was  appointed.  He  was  one 
of  the  magistrates  who  sat  in  the  trial  for  witchcraft  of 
Nathaniel  Greensmith  and  wife  in  1662.  A  certain  wain- 
scotted  pew  was  set  aside  for  the  use  of  magistrates  in 
Windsor  and  on  the  appointment  of  Daniel  Clark  the 
Town  Meeting  made  the  following  record:  '  .May  5,  1651. 
At  a  meeting  of  the  Towne  Mr.  Clark  was  appointed  to 
Sitt  in  the  greate  pew." 

In  1663  William  Edwards,  whose  descendants  later 
married  those  of  Daniel  Clark,  had  him  removed  from 
the  Secretaryship  for  "infringement  of  Royal  Preroga- 
tive"' and  he  was  offered  the  office  of  Assistant  Secre- 
tary, which  he  proudly  declined.  He  was  later  reinstated 
for  a  season.  In  1679  ne  was  ma(^e  teacher  and  kept 
school  for  eighteen  months,  receiving  forty  pounds  for 
this  and  other  work.  The  house  lot  which  fell  to  him 
was  a  triangular  piece  on  the  west  side  of  Farrington 
River,  the  "Riverlet"  near  the  Newberry  lot  and  that  of 
Rev.  John  Wareham.  In  1662  Daniel  Clark  and  John 
Mason  had  four  hundred  acres  granted  them,  and  in 
1665  the  former  received  another  grant  which  was  sold 
to  Daniel   Gilbert   in    1672. 

Daniel   Clark,   Jr.,   afforded    his     father    considerable 


HONORABLE    DANIEL    CLARK  1 7 

trouble  and  anxiety  at  times.  He  was  hasty  of  speech  and 
was  fined  twenty  pounds  for  making  contemptuous  re- 
marks about  Major  Treat,  who  had  him  sent  to  jail. 
Having  confessed  his  fault  and  "Manifested  some  signs 
of  repentance"  the  Court,  earnestly  entreated  by  Major 
Treat  (urged  on  by  Daniel  Clark,  Senior),  ordered  the 
vouth  released  from  prison  and  later  remitted  the  fine  in 
order  that  he  might,  as  his  father  expressed  it,  "pursue 
his  art  and  trade"  and  settle  among  them  undiscouraged 
by  fines.  In  1704  Daniel,  Jr.,  Locksmith,  was  fined  ten 
shillings  and  sent  to  jail  for  voting  out  of  his  district  but 
was  later  pardoned. 

Daniel  Clark's  second  wife  was  Martha  (Pitkin)  Wal- 
cott,  widow  of  Simon  Walcott,  whose  six  children  he  took 
under   his   roof  with   their   mother   in    1689.     Governor 
Roger  Walcott  in  his  private  journal  wrote,  "In  the  year 
1689  my  mother  marry ed  with  Daniel  Clark,  Esq.,  and 
I  went  with  her  to  live  on  the  West  side  of  the  river." 
Again  he  said,  "In  the  year  1691  thro'  the  constant  moni- 
tions of  my  father  in  law  and  my  mother  I  had  many  con- 
victions of  my  sin   and  danger  but  after  a   while  they 
wore  off."  [  !]    Finally  we  have  the  last  brief  entry  with 
its  simple  tribute  to  the  worth  of  the  man,  "In  the  year 
1 710 — the   10th  of  August  dyed  my   kind  father-in-law 
Daniel  Clark,  Esq.,  in  the  86th  year  of  his  age,  with  which 
I  was  much  affected." 

Daniel  Clark  has  been  called  "the  great-grandfather  of 
governors."  He  educated  his  stepson,  Roger  Wolcott 
(who  became  governor),  who  married  Sarah  Drake, 
Daniel  Clark's  granddaughter,  and  had  Oliver  Wolcott, 
Governor  of  Connecticut,  whose  son,  Oliver,  was  Gov- 
ernor, 1817-27.  Roger  Wolcott,  a  descendant,  was  Gov- 
ernor of  Massachusetts  and  Clark  Bissell,  another  de- 
scendant, was  Governor  of  Connecticut,  1847-49.    Ursula 


l8  CLARK    GENEALOGY 

Wolcott,  a  daughter  of  Roger  Wolcott  and  Sarah  Drake, 
married  Mathew  Griswold,  Governor  of  Connecticut,  and 
of  their  descendants  it  is  said  no  less  than  twelve  became 
governors. 

Daniel  Clark's  father-in-law  was  a  man  of  property 
and  influence.  He  received  from  the  General  Court  of 
Dorchester  a  grant  of  land,  ioo  acres,  in  Neponsett 
March,  1634,  and  many  grants  from  the  Dorchester  Pro- 
prietary. He  laid  out  a  large  farm  in  Squantum  and 
built  a  house  there.  He  lived  on  "The  Rock,"  1634, 
where  he  was  freeman  and  selectman.  In  1635  he  was 
appointed  to  oversee  works  at  the  castle ;  was  early  en-
