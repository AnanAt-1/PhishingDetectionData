								<p>There are two major classes of ASW projectiles; proximity and contact weapons. 
								The former, such as the depth charge, must be large enough to damage a submarine 
								even at a great distance. The nuclear depth charge - such as used on ASROC and 
								SUBROC - achieves the greatest kill radius, but has obvious political consequences. 
								Contact weapons, such as Hedgehog and Squid, can be much smaller, but must be 
								either guided into their targets or else used in very large numbers in order to 
								obtain a kill. A homing torpedo is an intermediate case, since - in theory - its 
								effective homing volume may be comparable to even a nuclear depth charge.</p>

								<p>Depth charges were first developed by the <a href="WAMBR_ASW.php">British Royal 
								Navy</a> in 1916. In February 1917 the USN Bureau of Ordnance began production of 
								the first USA depth charge, the Mark 1, producing over 10,000 units during the war 
								although it was found to be unreliable and not powerful enough to sink a U-boat.
								
								<p>The USN agreed in 1917 to produce 15,000 of the British Type D depth 
								charge for the Royal Navy, although the Bureau of Ordnance quickly found that the 
								British hydrostatic fuze was unsafe and unreliable and started to design their own. 
								At about the same time the design was completed and beginning testing, the Royal Navy 
								communicated that they had also found their fuze to be defective and had designed 
								a new and more reliable type to replace it. Comparison tests against the old and new 
								British fuze designs and the new American one were conducted at the Newport Torpedo 
								facility and the conclusion was that the American design was superior and had a 
								greater range of depth settings. It was also found that the British Type D depth 
								charge had a tendency to explode prematurely when used with a projector.</p>
								
								<p>When considering how to get a depth charge off the ship and into the water, 
								the USN was unimpressed with the British method of using a sling which held a 
								single depth charge as it was a slow and cumbersome process. Instead, the USN 
								designed a simple rack capable of holding multiple charges which could be rolled 
								off the back of the ship. This first depth charge rack, designated as the USN 
								Mark 1, was quite successful and was widely used by the British and French navies 
								during the rest of the war.

								<p>Dropping depth charges off the stern via a rack or track was standard practice 
								for ASW vessels in both World Wars. For the heavier depth charges, such as the 
								USN Mark 4 and the Mark 7, this was the only method used, while the smaller depth 
								charges could be used with "Y" and "K" guns. Destroyer and Destroyer Escorts 
								generally had two racks while smaller ships had one.</p>

								<p>Relatively little research work on ASW weapons was undertaken during the interwar 
								period, the most significant effort being a 1936 study by the Special Board on Naval 
								Ordnance which showed by mathematical analysis that depth charges with 600 lbs. (272 
								kg) charges would always be more effective than those with 300 lbs. (136 kg) charges 
								even when the smaller number of the heavier type that could be carried was taken 
								into account.</p>

								<p>Projectors for depth charges and ahead-throwing projectors for Hedgehogs, Mousetrap 
								and various signal and flare projectors formed a single Mark series. Later ASW Rocket 
								Launchers were included in the general Rocket Launcher series. The two most 
								significant ones are detailed below.</p>

								<p>"Blind Time" is the time between when a weapon is launched and when it reaches the 
								target location. In addition, most early sonar systems lost the target submarine on 
								close approach, usually requiring a "sprint" to reduce blind time. For depth charges, 
								this meant that they were dropped or fired after the sonar contact was lost. Hedgehog 
								was the first "ahead-fired" weapon that could be used while the attacking ship still 
								had sonar contact on the target submarine. This reduced the blind time by two-thirds 
								when compared to depth charges.</p>
								
								<p>The USA manufactured a total of 43,466 depth charges during World War I, broken down 
								as follows:

								<p>For World War II, the USA built a total of 622,128 depth charges of all types 
								between December 1941 and September 1945. This figure does not include Hedgehog, 
								Mousetrap and experimental units not placed in service use. Over half of these 
								depth charges were still on hand at the end of hostilities.</p>

								<p>In the first few months of the war only 5 percent of all depth charge attacks 
								were successful. Normal combat conditions reduced that figure to 3 percent. Combat 
								records showed that in early 1942 the lethal probability of a single depth charge 
								pattern (barrage) was about 3 percent and five attacks would raise the chance of 
								a kill to about 10 percent. The possibility of inflicting significant damage to a 
								submarine was about 30 percent after five attacks. By the end of 1943, better 
								weapons and tactics had improved these figures such that about 30 percent of all 
								detected submarines suffered at least some damage and 20 percent were killed. By 
								the last year of the war, at least 35 percent of all submarines attacked were 
								being damaged while 30 percent were killed. In mid-1944, the USN was claiming an 
								8 percent kill rate with a single Hedgehog pattern. By the middle of 1945, that 
								figure had risen to 10 percent.</p>

								<p>In the Atlantic Theater, US surface ships sank 60 submarines, shore-based 
								aircraft sank 54, ship-borne aircraft sank 32 and 40 were destroyed by bombing raids 
								on yards and bases. In the Pacific Theater, surface ships sank 60 Japanese submarines, 
								shore-based aircraft sank 3.5 and ship-borne aircraft sank another 9.5.</p>

									<p>The first USN Depth Charge, introduced into service in February 1917. 
									Commonly called an "ashcan," this was a relatively simple device. "There 
									were no arrangements to launch them, and ships picked the strongest man in 
									the crew to heave them over the stern when attacking a suspected periscope, 
									oil slick, or unsuspecting whale." - from "Bayly's Navy." The DC divided 
									into two sections when launched into the water; a float which remained on 
									the surface and which unreeled a cable to the sinking explosive section. 
									The explosive was triggered when the cable went taut. The depth could be 
									easily set anywhere from 25 to 100 feet (6 to 30 m). The USN placed orders 
									for 10,000 units, but this design proved too complicated for reliable action 
									and the explosive charge was too small to be effective.</p>

									<p>A note on sources: "US Naval Weapons" states that this DC weighed 200 lbs. 
									(91 kg). However, based upon the photographs shown here and the description of 
									how it was manually launched by a single sailor, it would seem that this is a 
									misprint and the figure above the correct value.

											<p>The first USN DC to use a magnetic pistol, this DC was built with an 
											aluminum casing so as not to interfere with the magnetic sensor. The Mark 
											8 was considered to be 7 times as lethal as the Mark 6 and 7 times as 
											lethal as the Mark 9. However, it was found to be unreliable and took 
											constant work in order to maintain its effectiveness. A backup 
											hydrostatic pistol was also fitted and by the end of the war the magnetic 
											pistols were no longer being used.</p>

											<p>The magnetic pistol was armed at 35 feet (11 m) or 200 feet (61 m) and 
											set to explode about 20 - 25 feet (6 - 7.5 m) from the submarine.

											<p>Also carried 150 lbs. (68 kg) lead weight to increase the sink rate.</p>

											<p>Over 76,000 were built, but it was never issued in large numbers and was 
											withdrawn shortly after the war ended because of its high maintenance 
											requirements. Some 57,000 were still in stock as of September 1945.</p>

											<p>This DC had a "teardrop" shape for a much greater sink rate and was the 
											standard DC by the latter part of the war. Used fins to create a stabilizing 
											spin. In some later versions the depth limit was increased to 1,000 feet 
											(305 m). Late in the war the explosive charge was changed to Torpex. Sink rate for 
											Mod 2 could be reduced to 15 or 20 fps (4.5 or 6.1 mps) when spoiler plates were 
											attached to the case nose. These were used for slower warships to allow them to 
											escape the explosion plume.</p>

									<p>In 1917 the USN rejected the British Thornycroft DC thrower as being over-engineered 
									and too difficult to mass produced. At the same time, the USN was experimenting with the 
									<a href="WNUS_6pounder_m1.php">Davis non-recoiling AA gun</a>. Lt. Cmdr. A.J. Stone, 
									USNRF, proposed using this technique to launch depth charges. The result was the "Y" 
									gun which fired two DC simultaneously, one to either side. Work began in 1917 at Stone's 
									former employer, the General Ordnance Company in Groton, Connecticut, prior to receipt 
									of a formal order on 8 December 1917. The first projector was delivered two days later. 
									This became standard equipment during World War I on many destroyers and sub-chasers, 
									with 974 being produced.</p>

									<p>These projectors used a 3" (7.62 cm) blank cartridge to fire the arbors (depth charge 
									holders). The arbors were inserted into each arm of the projector and then the depth 
									charges were placed onto the arbors. After the gun was fired, the arbors fell into the 
									sea separately from the depth charges. The charge could be varied to provide ranges of 
									50, 66 or 80 yards (46, 60 or 73 m).</p>

									<p>The Y-gun projectors took up precious centerline space and could not be quickly 
									reloaded following an attack. Destroyers carried at most two, but more usually one, 
									projector. Marks 5 and 7 were modified versions of the Mark 1 and the Mark 8 was not in 
									service.</p>

									<p>Known as the "K-gun" as it resembled the letter "K", the Projector Mark 6 was 
									introduced in 1941 just in time for World War II. Fired a single Mark 6, 9 or 14 
									depth charge to ranges of 60 to 150 yards (55 to 137 m) with a flight time of 3.4 
									to 5.1 seconds. Since the Mark 6 did not need to be sited on the centerline, many 
									more could be used on each ship. Typically, four to six were mounted on destroyers 
									while destroyer escorts carried eight. Still used up to the 1950s in the USN. A 
									number of K-guns were supplied to Britain and other Allies as part of Lend-Lease. 
									Arbors had a moveable stop whose position was changed when used with a 
									<a href="WAMBR_ASW.php#Mark_VII_Heavy">British Depth Charge Mark 7 Heavy</a>.</p>
									
									<p>Like the Y-gun, this projector required an arbor (holder) which had to be inserted 
									into the projector before the depth charge could be loaded and which fell into the sea 
									separately from the depth charge. Arbors consisted of a tubular stem 24 inches long by 
									6 inches in diameter (61 cm x 15 cm), closed on one end and with a 12 by 31 inch (30.5 
									x 79 cm) tray welded to the open end. The stem fits into the projector barrel and acts 
									as a projectile when fired. The arbor weights were: Mark 6, 70 lbs. (32 kg); Mark 7 and 
									Mark 7 Mod 1, 65 lbs. (29.5 kg).</p>
									
									<p>The propellant was black powder in a 3" (7.62 cm) casing and was supplied in three 
									loads for ranges of 60, 90 and 150 yards (55, 82 and 137 m).</p>
									
									<p>The Depth Charge Projector Mark 9 was a revised version of the K-gun with a built-in 
									arbor that was tested in 1944 on the frigate USS Asheville (PF-1). The weight savings 
									proved trivial and the project was abandoned.</p>

									<p>First USN Hedgehog projectors, adapted from the 
									<a href="WAMBR_ASW.php#Hedgehog">British 24-spigot mortar</a>. More popular and more 
									successful with the USN than with the Royal Navy, possibly because of better sonar 
									detection practices. Production in the USA began in late 1942 and differed from the 
									British design in being both more rugged and more flexible in operation. A target 
									designation transmitter and gun train indicator, both based upon the British models, 
									provided a greater measure of control than was available with conventional depth 
									charges.</p>
									<p>Projectiles were 7.2 inches (18.3 cm) in diameter and weighed 65 lbs. (29.5 kg) 
									with an explosive charge of 35 lbs. (15.9 kg) of Torpex. Sinking speed was 22 to 23.5 
									fps (6.7 to 7.2 mps). Mark 10 fired an elliptical pattern 195 feet (59 m) in width and 
									168 feet (51 m) long at a range of 283 yards (259 m). The Mark 11 fired a circular 
									pattern 267 yards (244 m) wide at a range of 267 yards (244 m) from the firing ship. 
									Could be trained up to 25 degrees by tilting the firing platform. Total weight for a 
									dual installation and six reloads was 28,720 lbs. (13,027 kg).</p>
									<p>Missiles were fired in pairs with an interval of either 0.1 or 0.2 seconds between 
									pairs. The order was such that the missiles with the highest trajectories were fired 
									first while those with the flattest trajectories were fired last. This allowed all 
									missiles to hit the water at about the same time. Reload time was 3 minutes. When 
									aimed to impact at 200 yards (180 m) from the firing ship, it took about 17 seconds 
									from the time the missiles were fired until they sank to a depth of 200 feet (61 m) 
									and 34 seconds to reach a depth of 600 feet (183 m).</p>
									<p>Some of the advantages of this weapon were that:</p>

									<ol>
									
										<li>They only exploded if they hit something, which meant that the firing ship 
										could more quickly make follow-on attacks if the previous attack was unsuccessful.</li>
										<li>Since unsuccessful attacks did not disturb the water, ASDIC/Sonar performance 
										was not affected.</li>
										<li>The projectiles had a higher sinking rate than conventional depth charges which 
										again sped up the time that it took to make follow-on attacks.</li>
										
									</ol>

									<p>The principle disadvantage of Hedgehog was its 40 ton recoil force, which precluded 
									it being used on small warships. This led to the development of Mousetrap, as described 
									below.</p>
									<p>It should be noted that the USN considered that the Hedgehog projectiles to be missiles, 
									not rockets, as the propelling charge was entirely used up prior to the projectile leaving 
									the spigot. Propellant was NC in USN service.</p>

										<p>Mousetrap rocket projector with four rails. This weapon was originally classified 
										as a Rocket Launcher and retained its original Mark number when reclassified as an 
										ASW projector. This weapon was developed to take the place of Hedgehog for smaller 
										ships such as patrol craft which could not withstand the recoil forces generated by 
										that weapon.</p>
										<p>An 85 lbs. (39 kg) projectile was originally used, but this was too heavy to 
										man-handle in rough seas. The warhead was changed to the lighter one of the Hedgehog 
										(see above), which had the added benefit of simplifying logistics.</p>
										<p>The mountings were usually fitted in pairs and could not be compensated for rolling. 
										Launcher had a fixed elevation of 48 degrees. Not considered to be as effective as 
										Hedgehog, but did give those smaller ships an ahead-firing weapon.</p>
										<p>Projectiles were 7.2 inches (18.3 cm) in diameter and weighed 65 lbs. (29.5 kg) 
										with an explosive charge of 31 lbs. (14.1 kg) of TNT. Torpex warheads added about 2.5 
										lbs. (1.1 kg) to the overall weight. Total length was 38.6 inches (98 cm). Unlike the 
										Hedgehog missile projectiles, this projectile was classified by the USN as a rocket 
										as it uses a sustainer propellant that burned for 0.2 to 0.7 seconds.</p>
