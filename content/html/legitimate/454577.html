By that time, he had abducted and tortured at least six young men, and the Kansas City Police Department&nbsp;suspected him in two other disappearances.

Volumes of pictures were recovered by the Kansas City Police Department, and remain in their possession.  He claimed that he was trying to "help" some of his victims by giving them antibiotics&nbsp;after torturing them. He tried to gouge one of his victim's eyes out "to see what would happen". He buried one victim's skull in his backyard, and put the dismembered bodies out for the weekly trash pickup.  The bodies were never recovered but left in the landfill.<br />
<br />
A few months before the arrest was made, Berdella was offered a ride home from a bar by people who noticed he was too intoxicated to drive. On the way back, Berdella allegedly told stories about young men he'd had abducted and tortured in the previous months. It was not taken seriously at that time considering his advanced state of intoxication.<br />
