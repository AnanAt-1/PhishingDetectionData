                <font size="-1">(1955)<br> &quot;On the whole, this depressing story is well told; its most violent and tasteless episodes give evidence of originality and a good eye and ear. . . . With this novel out of his system, Mr. Richler&#x2019;s second one may
                    be an entirely mature and rewarding book.&quot;</font>

                <font size="-1">(1963)<br> &quot;[Richler] has a ruthlessly antic imagination and he leaves few aspects of Canadian civilization unscarred. Some of his best darts will find targets in the United States.&quot;</font>

                <font size="-1">(1975)<br> &quot;Mordecai Richler is a funny man, a good writer, and everyone should go out tomorrow morning and beat his local bookseller into submission if he hasn&apos;t got a nice plump display of books titled &apos;Jacob Two-Two Meets
                    the Hooded Fang.&apos;&quot;</font>

                <font size="-1"><br> &quot;At times, [Richler] looks nervously like a bomber without a base, a novelist searching for a vantage point from which he might give his satire a more coherent direction and a larger shape. The effort is admirable; and in the
                    meantime, the comedy speaks to a recognizable distress.&quot;</font>

                <font size="-1">(1980)<br> &quot; . . . all in all &apos;Joshua Then and Now&apos; is a remarkable bittersweet accomplishment. Its slapstick and pathos blend artfully to make a wine of unique flavor.&quot;</font>

                <font size="-1">(1984)<br> &quot;Mordecai Richler, a funny writer but one wise enough to be a serious novelist, has collected &apos;The Best of Modern Humor.&apos; His sole criterion for the material he chose, he says in his introduction, was that &apos;it
                    had to make me laugh.&apos; That is hard to argue with. But somebody&apos;s got to do it.&quot;</font>

                    here strikes both adult and child as genuinely funny.&quot;</font>

                <font size="-1">(1990)<br> &quot;Regardless of what its author may actually have experienced, &apos;Solomon Gursky Was Here&apos; reads as if it were great fun to write. Dense, intricately plotted, it takes exuberant, nose-thumbing joy in traditional
                    storytelling with all its nervy cliffhangers and narrative hooks, its windfall legacies, stolen portraits, murders and revenges, its clues that drop on the story line with a satisfying thud.&quot;</font>

                    for the most part, simply angry.&quot;</font>

                <font size="-1">(1994)<br> &quot;In 1992 the Canadian novelist Mordecai Richler traveled to Israel. &apos;This Year in Jerusalem&apos; is the report of what he saw there and the people he met. He lets them speak for themselves and it makes lively reporting.
                    . . . &apos;This Year in Jerusalem&apos; is history made personal and it rings true.&quot; </font>

                <font size="-1">(1974)<br> &quot;Perhaps because of the close collaboration between Mr. Richler and [film director Ted] Kotcheff . . . the film looks very much like a novelist&#x2019;s movie. Such an abundance of visual and narrative detail is essentially
                    literary. This could mean disaster for a movie but not this time.&quot;</font>
