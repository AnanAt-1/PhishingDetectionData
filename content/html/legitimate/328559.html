<p>Bishopscourt, Auckland, New Zealand, January I, 1887.--A perfect
  day for holiday-makers, and for those who, like ourselves, have
  much to do at home, especially in the way of clearing off arrears
  of correspondence. As the late Bishop Thirlwall said, "A
  Bishop never can take a holiday." We have had very little
  rain during the past month, and the grass begins to look brown;
  but the trees are at their best, and the sky and sea to-day are
  in tint like those of Naples and the Mediterranean in May and
  June. Our rest, when we can get any, is to sit out in our balcony
  for a few hours on public holidays, enjoying our beautiful view
  over the harbour, and as far as Kawau Island, the Little Barrier,
  and Cape Colville. <i>Bishopscourt </i>is charmingly situated
  on the top of a hill about two hundred feet above the sea. The
  site was wisely chosen by Bishop Selwyn, and was purchased by
  him at public auction in 1859--a little more than four acres--for
  £96 18<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. Nearly [1/2] four more acres,
  not at all equal to the original site, were added to the estate
  in 1880, at a cost of £1100. The garden, orchard, and paddock
  at present comprise about six acres; the remainder of the estate
  being leased and built upon. The stillness of Sunday reigns;
  a great part of the population having by this time (10 a.m.)
  left the city and its suburbs for the day, in carriages and carts,
  and by train, steamboat, and omnibus. Here the new year began
  with a peal from our "cathedral bells"--the bells which
  are to belong to our cathedral when we have one. They were in
  the London Exhibition of 1862, and were purchased for £1000.
  Our ringers are young men living close by, who do their work
  without pay. The tower in which the bells are hung being of wood,
  they cannot be swung, but are struck, and, to prevent too great
  vibration, are fixed not much above the ground; hence their sound
  does not reach very far. The thermometer at noon to-day in our
  dining-room, on which the sun shines from 10 a.m., was 75°.
  On the coldest day of winter we have never seen it lower than
  44° 30' indoors. E.'s whole morning was taken up in arranging
  for the burial this evening of an infant, whose mother is penniless
  and father <i>non est inventus</i>. The child died at the Women's
  Home, an institution founded by her and a few friends in 1884
  (of which an account will be found in the Appendix). According
  to our custom on public holidays, we put up a notice on our front
  door, "NO ONE IN," and let our servants go out for
  the day. New Year's Day is a great racing day at Auckland, the
  racecourse being at Ellerslie, a beautiful suburb, about four
  miles distant from the city. In the evening, the Governor, Sir
  W. D. [2/3] Jervois, came to see us, on his return from the races.
  He arrived in Auckland yesterday from Wellington, having accepted
  the invitation of the Auckland Racing Company to be present at
  their annual Summer Meeting. Sir William is a great favourite
  in Auckland, as he is in all parts of the colony, and deserves
  to be; on account of the real interest he takes in all things
  appertaining to the prosperity of New Zealand, and of the influence
  for good everywhere exercised by himself, Lady Jervois, and other
  members of the family. Sir William Jervois came to New Zealand
  very opportunely in 1883, just before what is known as the Russian
  scare, when the Colonial Governments were obliged to think of
  the defence of their harbours, in anticipation of visits from
  Russian cruisers. His great experience in constructing fortifications
  was of the utmost value to the colonies of Australasia, and to
  this one in particular, and no doubt saved the colonies a large
  sum of money. [Sir W. Jervois was Deputy Director of Fortifications
  at the War Office, London, for many years.]</p>
<p>These colonies have not always been as fortunate in the family
  of the Governor as we in New Zealand are at the present time.
  Indeed, it is scarcely too much to say that not long since in
  one of them the tone of "society," that is, the section
  of the people who are much at Government House, was seriously
  injured, and the morale of many of the young people in danger
  of being lowered, by the example and the unworthy principles
  of the lady who is officially regarded as, in a manner, a representative
  of Her Majesty the Queen. A leading citizen of the colonial capital
  referred to told me that, had the said lady not left the colony
  when she [3/4] did, he would have been obliged to forbid his
  daughters visiting at Government House.</p>
<p>January 2, Sunday.--In the morning, I rode to S. Barnabas,
  one of our suburban churches, at Mount Eden, to take part in
  the service with the Rev. W. Beatty, whose last day there it
  was. I read the second Lesson, and was celebrant. Mr. Beatty
  preached a short, pointed, and unconventional sermon, characterised
  by common sense and plain speaking. He is now the Warden of our
  Church College, of which the chief work at present is to prepare
  candidates for Holy Orders. An account of the college will be
  found in the Appendix. [See Appendix K, p. 370.] Mr. Beatty came
  to us a year ago <i>proprio motu</i>, from the curacy of Rusthall,
  Tunbridge Wells. By nearly every mail from England, I receive
  letters from clergymen, offering me their services. My almost
  invariable answer to such applications is, "If you come,
  it must be at your own risk. I cannot pay your passage, and am
  afraid to invite a stranger to come so far; but no clergyman
  fit for our work has ever come to us from England and failed
  to obtain employment." Mr. Beatty, on his arrival, was offered
  two charges, one of which, the office of assistant-minister of
  S. Sepulchre's parish, he undertook; and after working, with
  great acceptance (which Mrs. Beatty also shared with him) to
  all his people, for a little more than six months, he was offered
  by the Governors the Wardenship of S. John's College. The special
  charge of the assistant-minister of S. Sepulchre's parish is
  to minister to the people of the S. Barnabas district. Soon after
  Mr. Beatty's arrival the church had to be enlarged, and it now
  holds about [4/5] four hundred and fifty people. The average
  amount of the offertory collections at S. Barnabas on ordinary
  Sundays is a little less than £5; there being no rich people
  among the congregation. In the afternoon, I rode on to S. Andrew's,
  Epsom, another of our beautiful suburbs. The church was designed
  by the Rev. J. Kinder, formerly Master of S. John's College,
  and is a monument of his good taste. The clergyman was away in
  the country on Sunday-school inspection duty. As we have no endowment
  for our Inspector, his office has to be combined with the charge
  of this district, in which there are two churches to be served.
  Accordingly, the Inspector can only visit distant schools when
  his Sunday duties at home can be taken by a clergyman who has
  not to be paid a <i>honorarium</i>. At Epsom, the service consisted
  of Evening Prayer, a Baptism, and Holy Communion. The church
  was very tastefully decorated with white lilies and scarlet geraniums.
  S. Andrew's Church is beautifully situated, being surrounded
  by downs, on which, owing to the volcanic nature of the soil,
  the grass is luxuriant and green. The small cemetery surrounding
  the church contains several interesting graves; among others
  that of Mrs. Wynyard, the widow of a general officer of that
  name, who was officiating Governor of the colony in 1854. In
  twenty years' time Epsom will be to Auckland what S. John's Wood
  is to London. After the service, I rode on to Christ Church,
  Ellerslie, another of our beautiful suburbs, the head-quarters
  of the clergyman whose <i>locum tenens</i> I was in the afternoon
  and evening. This church is adorned with a series of handsome
  painted windows, the gift of Mr. Alfred Bell, of the well-known
  firm of Clayton and Bell, through his [5/6] old friend Mr. Albin
  Martin, a resident in the district. It is a very small building,
  of wood, like most of our Auckland churches, but large enough
  for the present congregation. It has no endowment attached to
  it, but the people contribute £100 a year towards the clergyman's
  stipend. After the service, I rode back to Bishopscourt. At this
  season of the year I do not wear in church a black satin <i>chimere</i>,
  such as bishops commonly wear in England, but a fine linen rochet,
  with sleeves, over a black llama cassock, with a D.D. hood. These
  robes I carry with me on my journeys, in a small leather bag,
  fastened by a strap to the right side of my saddle behind.</p>
<p>January 3, Monday.--Another public holiday, spent by me mainly
  in writing letters for the English mail by San Francisco. In
  the morning, one of the New Zealand Shipping Company's direct
  steamers, the <i>Rimutaka </i>(4474 tons), arrived, bringing
  to us the Rev. T. H. Sprott, who had accepted the office of assistant-minister
  in the parish of the Holy Sepulchre, offered to him by the incumbent,
  Archdeacon Dudley. The people of the S. Barnabas district of
  that parish, in the hope of obtaining another clergyman like-minded
  to Mr. Beatty, when he left them for the wardenship of S. John's
  College, asked him to recommend a clergyman to the incumbent
  and the vestry; and Mr. Sprott was accordingly recommended, and
  was invited by Archdeacon Dudley and his vestry, with my sanction,
  to "come over and help us." The vestry guaranteed a
  stipend of not less than £250 for two years, and paid £50
  towards the cost of passage. We find it hazardous to invite clergymen
  to come to us from England on the strength of written [6/7] testimonials
  only. Personal and recent knowledge, on the part of the Bishop
  or some one on whose judgment he can depend, is necessary to
  warrant his promising to appoint to a definite charge in New
  Zealand a clergyman, however well recommended by unknown persons
  in England. Besides the general defect of written testimonials,
  which (rightly, perhaps) make no mention of qualifications that
  are lacking in those for whom they are written, there is the
  great difference between the circumstances of a clergyman of
  an <i>established </i>Church, like that of England, and those
  of a clergyman of what is called a <i>voluntary </i>Church, like
  that of New Zealand. A clergyman might be efficient in many positions
  in England but quite unsuited for a New Zealand charge.</p>
<p>Even when selected by friends who know what qualities are
  specially required in New Zealand clergymen, some of our candidates
  for Holy Orders sent out from England have proved to be very
  unfit for our colonial work. The most striking case of such unfitness
  that I have heard of was that of a young man selected in England,
  by a member of the Melanesian Mission staff, for work with the
  late Bishop Patteson in the islands of the South-West Pacific.
  The story--for the accuracy of which I cannot vouch--is as follows:--Mr.
  A------came from England to be ordained by Bishop Patteson, when
  the head-quarters of the Mission were at Kohimarama, a few miles
  from Auckland, on the coast of our land-locked harbour. Soon
  after his arrival in Auckland he hired a boat to take him to
  the Mission station. There, to his surprise, he found no wharf,
  and had to wait in the boat until some one could be got to carry
  him ashore through the water. In response to his [7/8] shouts,
  a man, in a flannel shirt and trousers, at last waded out from
  the shore and "gave a back" to the new-comer, landing
  him dry on the beach. In answer to inquiries for the Bishop's
  palace (!), a small building close by was pointed out, and to
  a further question of "Where is the Bishop?" the man
  with tucked-up flannels said, "I'm the Bishop." This
  experience was somewhat disconcerting; but worse followed. Next
  morning, the members of the Mission staff went to their several
  duties, some of them being engaged in putting up a post-and-rail
  fence around a paddock. To this employment the new-comer was
  told off, and he soon discovered that it did not agree with the
  softness of his hands. Thereupon he had an interview with Bishop
  Patteson, and requested to be informed what his ordinary duties
  would be if he remained with the Mission. The Bishop said, "All
  I can promise you is that I will not ask you to do what I do
  not do myself." This answer being unsatisfactory, the new-comer
  decided that he had better at once give up all idea of becoming
  a Melanesian missionary--a decision in which the Bishop concurred.
  Afterwards the young man's friends claimed compensation from
  the Mission; and the Bishop, to save further unpleasantness,
  as he told me himself, paid one hundred pounds out of his own
  pocket to the young man and his friends.</p>
<p>In the evening, we rode out to S. John's College, about five
  miles from Bislwpscourt. The buildings have not been used for
  college purposes since 1883, when the students took up their
  residence in Parnell, a suburb of Auckland, in some small houses,
  within a quarter of a mile of Bishopscourt; the purpose of the
  removal, which [8/9] was recommended by the Governors and sanctioned
  by the General Synod, being to enable the students to attend
  lectures at our Auckland University College. [See Appendix A,
  p. 331.] The buildings at Tamaki, some of which are in a ruinous
  state in consequence of the sinking of the foundation, are at
  present in the occupation of the Rev. T. F. King, who is minister
  of the district. Mr. King came to New Zealand four years ago
  for the benefit of his health, which is still very delicate;
  but he has succeeded in establishing a good private school, in
  which there are at present forty boys, chiefly day scholars.
  His own gifts as a teacher, seconded by the motherly care for
  the scholars shown by Mrs. King, would attract many more pupils,
  if there was suitable accommodation for them at the college.</p>
<p>To-day we put up a placard on our front door with the words
  "SERVANTS HOLIDAY-MAKING" in large letters, to suggest
  to callers with no particular business that it might be as well
  to come another day. Our children, too, were out; so that E.
  and I had to answer the bell, and that pretty frequently, in
  addition to the burden of getting our letters finished in time
  for the mail to England. New Zealand has been called the paradise
  of domestic servants, chiefly, I suppose, on account of the good
  wages received by them, and of the facility of obtaining employment.
  To keep our house, with its long passages and many nooks and
  corners, in good order, and the grounds at all tidy, we are obliged
  to maintain an establishment of three women and a man. To each
  of the former we pay twelve shillings a week, and to the latter--who
  is non-resident--thirty-five [9/10] shillings. To keep down the
  weeds another man, at six shillings a day, is taken on occasionally.
  According to the New Zealand custom, the cook is also the laundress.</p>
<p>Great complaints are often made of New Zealand servants; but
  the mistress is, we think, as often to blame as the servant,
  in those houses in which a change of domestics more frequently
  occurs. There are doubtless servants and servants in the colonies
  as in England; but many of the employers of female servants in
  this country are new to the position, and do not know how to
  treat their subordinates. In many houses a "general servant"
  only is employed, and her drudgery is often great. E.'s servants
  rarely leave her, except to be married. Her system is, as far
  as possible, to make friends of them all, and to indulge them
  wisely, as she does her own children. Each one is allowed an
  evening out during the week, and a day once a month, and Sunday
  morning or evening, as well as Sunday afternoon (provided that
  one remains in the house); and once a year each woman has a week's
  holiday on full wages. A young woman told us not long since that
  on Christmas morning her mistress said to her, "You are
  to go on with your work as usual to-day; Christmas is not meant
  for servants." No wonder this girl gave notice a few days
  afterwards that she was going to look out for another situation;
  and her quondam mistress probably speaks of her as "an ungrateful
  hussy."</p>
<p>The number of public holidays in New Zealand much surprises
  new arrivals, and greatly tries the mothers of large families,
  who are commonly left to do all their household work for themselves
  on those days.</p>
<p>[11] It is certainly one of the chief pleasures of New Zealand
  life to know, on so many days of the year, that f nearly all
  the population are enjoying themselves in the open air. In the
  neighbourhood of Auckland there are very many lovely spots to
  which our artisans, with their wives and children, and all others
  with a few shillings to spare, can go for the day, by steamboat,
  or train, or omnibus. On those days E. and I stay at home, clearing
  off arrears of reading and writing, and finding by happy experience
  that life is more than endurable to those who are excused from
  participating in its "amusements."</p>
<p>January 4, Tuesday.--On this day, as on the Tuesday of each
  week when she is in Auckland, E. stayed at home in the afternoon
  to see visitors.</p>
<p>January 5, Wednesday.--The whole family went out to S. John's
  College at Tamaki, where I was to act as <i>locum tenens</i>
  for the clergyman of the district, Mr. King, for two Sundays,
  during his absence at Te Aroha. The grounds of the college are
  at this season of the year very charming. On the north side of
  the buildings in the distance is Rangitoto, an extinct volcano,
  rearing its picturesque head about one thousand feet out of the
  sea; between which and the college are many acres of broken land
  covered with original scrub, and in immediate proximity a well-kept
  lawn and shrubbery. When we arrived in the colony in February,
  1870, we found the college closed for want of funds, and the
  grounds in a very rough condition. A year afterwards, the Rev.
  J. Kinder was appointed to the mastership; and, being a man of
  great taste in such matters, and grudging no expenditure of labour
  or money on the improvement of Church property entrusted to his
  care, he turned the [11/12] wilderness into a paradise during
  his ten years' tenure of that office. Mr. King, who now occupies
  the premises, is a man of similar artistic tastes, and of the
  same generous Churchman's spirit; and, though he has received
  no pecuniary assistance from the college endowments, he has to
  a great extent restored the grounds to the good order in which
  they were left by Dr. Kinder in 1880. The old college buildings
  are in a ruinous condition. This is the result mainly of the
  impecuniosity of the trustees, the straggling character of the
  plan on which the buildings were constructed, the badness of
  the mortar in early days, and, above all, of the sinking of the
  ground under one of the houses. Until 1880 the gross income of
  the trust was only £862; and the cost of each scholar on
  the foundation, exclusive of tuition, was £45. The gross
  income of the trust at the present time is about £1300.
  After paying for repairs to buildings, the warden's stipend (£400),
  rent (i.e. interest on purchase-money) of temporary buildings
  in Parnell (£84), University College fees (£34 10<i>s</i>.),
  insurance, etc., the balance is about £250; that is, sufficient
  only to maintain five students on the foundation.</p>
<p>The chapel at S. John's College is quite unique. It is in
  good condition, inside and out; as it always will be, I trust,
  so long as its timbers hold together. Nearly all the windows
  are filled with painted glass, erected to the memory of Bishop
  Patteson, the Rev. J. Atkin, and Stephen Taroaniara, who were
  killed with him in 1871, the Revs. A. O. Cotton and W. Nihill,
  and others. Recently the whole of the interior has been carefully
  and reverently restored by the Rev. T. F. King, whose private
  school assembles daily in the chapel for short [12/13] vespers
  at four o'clock. On Sundays, the chapel is used as the parish
  church of the district, of which Mr. King is in charge. In "God's
  acre" around the chapel there are several graves of much
  interest, including that of the founder's (Bishop Selwyn) only
  daughter, Margaret Frances, who died in 1851, aged five months,
  Mr. Cotton's, Mrs. Blackett's, Mrs. Kinder's (the mother of the
  late Master), and Mrs. Haultain's, the wife of the Hon. Colonel
  Haultain, who for many years held the unpaid office of secretary
  to the trustees of the college, keeping the accounts in a manner
  that would have delighted the heart of the most exact of finance
  ministers. Among other brass tablets in the chapel is one to
  the memory of Edward Meyrick, merchant, the founder of scholarships
  at the college--"a merchant man seeking goodly pearls,"
  as the tablet says; and one to the memory of Alfred Marsh Brown
  (the son of the late Archdeacon Brown of Tauranga and brother
  of Mrs. J. Kinder), in memory of whom valuable scholarships were
  endowed by the late Archdeacon, whose son died at the college
  in 1845. A touching story is told of the late Bishop in connection
  with the last illness of young Brown, whom the Bishop helped
  to nurse, sitting up with him at night in turn with others. The
  Bishop was to give the sick boy his medicine at three a.m., or
  some other early hour, but fell asleep, and did not wake for
  some time afterwards. When he awoke and discovered his mistake,
  he was troubled, especially when the patient informed him that
  he had called to him, "My lord, my lord," at the appointed
  time without succeeding in rousing him. "If you had said
  'George,'" answered the Bishop, "I should have woke
  at once."</p>
<p>[14] For several years the Blackett endowment was the chief
  support of the college. It consists of a piece of ground fifty-four
  feet by forty-one feet, at the corner of Queen and Shortland
  Streets, Auckland, and, together with some wooden shops erected
  thereon, was given to the college by Mr. J. C. Blackett (now
  of Egham), at the request of his wife, and was at the time valued
  at £500. The trustees now receive a ground rent of £500
  a year for the land, on which a fine substantial building (to
  be the property of the trust at the end of sixty years) has been
  erected by the South British Insurance Company.</p>
<p>The following adventure in connection with S. John's College
  Chapel is somewhat amusing:--In 1880, I went with our then Governor,
  the Hon. Sir Arthur Gordon, to show him this interesting building;
  the Rev. Dr. Kinder entering it with us. After inspecting the
  windows and brasses, his Excellency, about to depart, turned
  towards the door, which slammed to and could not be opened, as
  the fastening was on the outside. After thinking what we should
  do, Dr. Kinder decided on trying to get out through the vestry
  window, which opened above and below by swinging on pivots half-way
  up the sides, making an aperture of eighteen inches by ten inches.
  Dr. Kinder, after divesting himself of coat and waistcoat, got
  through the opening with some difficulty, and came round and
  opened the door for us. Oddly enough, while we were talking together
  of the strange accident inside the door, it slammed to again,
  as before.</p>
<p>This time the Governor offered to get through the window for
  us, but we would not let him, and Dr. Kinder repeated his former
  feat, and liberated us.</p>
<p>January 6, Thursday.--I received, through our [14/15] Primate,
  a formal notice from the Archbishop of Canterbury, dated July,
  1886, of his intention to "issue next year an invitation"
  to a Conference for the summer of 1888, and asking whether it
  is probable that I shall attend the Conference, and "whether
  there are any subjects of general importance which appear to
  you specially appropriate for discussion in the Conference."</p>
<p>I answered the Archbishop that inability to pay the fare to
  and from England might prevent my going, as it did in 1878. As
  a subject for discussion at the Conference, I named "the
  best means of bringing about a reunion of the disciples of Jesus
  Christ, especially of those who are not kept apart by a belief
  in the infallibility of the Bishop of Rome."</p>
<p>January 9, Sunday.--The eighty-third birthday of our beloved
  and revered Primate, the Bishop of Christ-church. Dr. Harper
  was consecrated first Bishop of that see in 1856, when the Southern
  Island was detached from the original diocese of New Zealand;
  and in 1868, on the resignation of the Primacy by Bishop Selwyn,
  he was elected to that office by our General Synod, which is
  the supreme governing body of our New Zealand Church. [See Appendix
  B, p. 334.] We are all proud of our Primate, as citizens, Churchmen,
  and in other relations. The fatherly manner in which he presides
  at the meetings of the General Synod is greatly conducive to
  the spirit of harmony; and his wide sympathies in all matters
  ecclesiastical are a standing discouragement to factiousness
  and narrowness.</p>
<p>In the absence of Mr. King, the clergyman of the district,
  I officiated as parish priest to-day in S. John's [15/16] Chapel.
  This being holiday time, and Mr. King's school being dispersed,
  the congregation was small. The harmonium was played by Miss
  Atkin, the sister of the Rev. Joseph Atkin, who died of a wound
  received at Nukapu on the day of Bishop Patteson's death. Mr.
  Atkin was one of the Bishop's most valued and trusted coadjutors,
  and was considered by him the right man to be head of the Mission,
  in case of his own death. This (the Sunday nearest the Epiphany)
  is the day on which our Diocesan Synod recommends that collections
  should be made in all our churches for the funds of the Melanesian
  Mission. [See Appendix C, p. 344.] I accordingly took, as the
  subject of my sermon in the morning, missionary work in general,
  and the work of Bishop Schvyn and our other missionaries in the
  islands of the South-West Pacific.</p>
<p>January 10, Monday.--E. and I rode to Kohimarama in the evening
  to see Mr. and Mrs. Atkin, the parents of the late Rev. Joseph
  Atkin mentioned above. Until recently Mr. Atkin was one of the
  Governors of S. John's College, and he was for many years a member
  of our Diocesan Synod. The spirit in which he bore the loss of
  his only son was in keeping with the Christian quietness and
  confidence by which his daily life is characterised. The Mission
  vessel, <i>Southern Cross</i>, used formerly to lie at anchor
  just below Mr. Atkin's house during the summer months; that is,
  when the hurricane season among the islands, from November to
  March, rendered cruising in these regions dangerous. In October,
  1871, Mr. Atkin was expecting his son to come to Auckland by
  the vessel for a short holiday, and, on seeing her entering the
  harbour, on October 31, [16/17] 1871, he went down to the beach
  to meet the boat by which he hoped his son would come ashore.
  He observed that the schooner's flag was half-mast high, and
  was therefore prepared for bad news of some kind. In answer to
  his question, "Where is Joe?" the Rev. C. Bice, one
  of the Mission staff who had come in the boat, said that "the
  worst" that could happen to him had happened. "Is he
  dead?" inquired the father; and, on being told that such
  was the case, he replied calmly, "Worse can happen to you
  missionaries than to die."</p>
<p>January 13, Thursday.--The country about Auckland is looking
  yellow and brown after a month's drought; the roads are deep
  in dust, and the air is thick with smoke from bush fires. We
  went to Bishopscourt this morning. In the early afternoon, I
  had interviews with clergymen and others on matters of business;
  and at 4.30 p.m. I presided at the monthly meeting of the Standing
  Committee. This committee consists of seven clergymen and five
  laymen elected annually by the Synod, with the Bishop as <i>ex-officio</i>
  chairman, whose consent is necessary for the passing of any motion
  by the committee. The duties of the committee are defined by
  a statute of the Synod. Of these, one of the chief is to administer
  the Home Mission Fund, from which grants are made towards the
  maintenance of clergy to minister to settlers in the poorer country
  districts. The fund (amounting in 1886 to about £900) consists
  of offertory collections and the donations of individuals. In
  the evening we rode back to Tamaki.</p>
<p>January 21.--I went to Awhitu on the west coast. A small tidal
  steamer leaves Onehunga almost daily for [17/18] this district.
  It took the vessel about two hours to get to the Awhitu wharf.
  There I was met by Mr. A. Palmer, the lay reader of the district,
  who brought a horse for me. We were about an hour and a half
  in riding to his house, which is prettily situated on high ground,
  from which the Manukau Harbour, near Puponga Point, can be seen.
  Mr. Palmer lives in patriarchal style; his married daughter with
  her husband and their five children occupying part of the house.
  The district contains some good land, on the tops and sides of
  high hills, about five hundred feet above the sea, which are
  separated by deep ravines of several hundreds of feet. The settlers
  are few and poor.</p>
<p>Here I met the Rev. John Haselden, the organising clergyman
  of our Home Mission. He had spent a few days in the district
  before my arrival, visiting the people and preparing candidates
  for Confirmation. Mr. Haselden's head-quarters are in Auckland,
  whence he travels in all directions, ministering to those of
  our people who live in districts in which there are not resident
  clergy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I had a talk with an old soldier, who served
  twenty-one years in the 66th Regiment, six of which were passed
  in India. When ill a short time before, his great trouble was
  the fear of there not being one of our clergy to bury him.</p>
<p>January 23, Sunday.--In the morning, I administered the Holy
  Communion to Mr. Palmer and members of his family in their dining-room.
  In the afternoon, I rode to the Awhitu Church, the property of
  the Presbyterians, where I preached, and afterwards confirmed
  four persons, of whom two were formerly children of our [18/19]
  Orphan Home. [See Appendix K, p. 370.] The Home is situated near
  Bishopscourt, on church land, and is managed by a Board consisting
  of Churchmen elected annually. It is a flourishing institution,
  mainly owing to the interest taken in it for many years by the
  honorary secretary, Mr. G. P. Pierce. In 1883, a sum of nearly
  £12,150 was left to the Home by Mr. Costley, the bulk of
  whose property was divided amongst seven Auckland institutions.
  At the service the prayers were said by Mr. Haselden, and the
  First Lesson read by Mr. Palmer, lay reader. At five o'clock
  we set out for the signal station on the south head of the Manukau
  Harbour, about six miles distant. As the track was in some places
  very rough, and in others very steep, we had to ride slowly.
  The community at the Manukau Head consists mainly of Government
  officers in charge of the signal station (eight hundred feet
  above the sea), the beacons, and the telegraph. The service was
  held in the little school-house near the signal station, which,
  having been erected by men of maritime experience and tastes,
  is rather too air-tight in hot weather, and is adorned profusely
  with blue paint. The prayers were said by Mr. Haseldcn, the first
  Lesson being read by Mr. Palmer, and I preached. Mr. Palmer comes
  here on three Sundays in each month to conduct public worship.
  Like our other lay readers, he receives no remuneration for his
  services. When a clergyman visits the district for a Sunday,
  the rule is that he receives a honorarium of two pounds, and
  has his travelling expenses paid. During my stay at the South
  Head I was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Leith, whose hospitality
  was quite sumptuous. The strawberries and cream [19/20] they
  gave us were as abundant as they were good and unexpected. Mr.
  Leith is in charge of the beacons by which, at night, vessels
  are steered in over the Manukau Bar.* He is a man of a mathematical
  mind, and would doubtless have been a high wrangler if he had
  gone to Cambridge at the age of nineteen or twenty. He has published
  two pamphlets, full of calculations, laboriously worked out,
  to show the reason why the bulk of the ocean is retained in the
  southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>January 27.--The New Zealand Board of the Church Missionary
  Society met to-day at Napier; but I was unable to attend it,
  as doing so would have involved an absence from Auckland of almost
  a fortnight, Napier being nearly four hundred miles distant (by
  sea) in the diocese of Waiapu. Moreover, I did not know of any
  matter of special importance that was to be dealt with at this
  meeting. The Board, which meets annually and manages the affairs
  of the C.M.S., consists of the Bishops of Auckland, Wellington,
  and Waiapu; Archdeacons Clarke and Williams; the Revs. R. Burrows
  and S. Williams; and Messrs. H. T. Clarke, F. Larkins, and T.
  Tanner. At this meeting the apportionment of the income (£2372)
  for the ensuing year was made. Of this sum, £860 were applied
  to salaries and grants in aid of salaries, £625 to the
  maintenance of native pastors, and £400 to the Gisborne
  College for theological students. The senior European missionaries
  receive their salaries from the Society in London, independently
  of the Board. The sum at the disposal of the Board includes £1400
  granted for general purposes by the</p>
<p>[H.M.S. Orpheus was wrecked here in February, 1863, when the
  commodore and 186 of the crew were drowned.]</p>
<p>Society in London, and £875, the estimated receipts
  for the rent of lands in New Zealand. The arrangement by which
  the affairs of the Society are managed by a Board, constituted
  as this one is, seems to work very satisfactorily; owing greatly
  to the rare qualifications for his office possessed by our excellent
  secretary, the Venerable W. L. Williams, a son of the first Bishop
  of Waiapu, an experienced missionary and a real lover of the
  Maori race. Among the resolutions passed by the Board on this
  occasion was the following:--"Inasmuch as the new Maori
  Hymnal, which is greatly appreciated by the Maori members of
  the Church throughout New Zealand, is mainly the work of Mr.
  Edward W. Williams, the hearty thanks of the Board are tendered
  to him for the same." Mr. E. W. Williams is the eldest son
  of the late Archdeacon H. Williams, of Waimate, Bishop Selwyn's
  first archdeacon, and is one of our best Maori scholars.</p>
<p>This morning, we saw our eldest son off by steamer on his
  return to school at Christchurch, in the south island. Several
  other Auckland boys went with him. It is rather hard to have
  to send a boy so far from home (765 miles by sea), and at so
  great an expense (about £100 a year), to obtain a good
  classical education. In Auckland we have efficient commercial
  schools and a University College; but no good grammar school,
  in which Greek is taught, and in which the high tone is given
  that is valuable beyond all mere book-learning. So far as I know,
  Christ's College, Canterbury, is the only school in the colony
  in which are to be obtained what are considered in England the
  essentials of a high-class public school education. At Whaneanui
  [21/22] there is a school of the same kind, of which the Rev.
  Dr. Harvey is head master; but it has not yet the large number
  of boys necessary to give the social training that is required,
  nor the large staff of masters necessary for the varied teaching
  that is essential to a first-class public school.</p>
<p>In the evening, E. and I crossed the water to Devonport, on
  our way to Albertland.</p>
<p>January 28.--We left Devonport at eight a.m. by Butler's coach
  with four horses, and about twelve o'clock reached the Orewa
  river, whither our horses had been sent on, the day before. We
  rested an hour, and had dinner at the house of Mr. De Grut, who
  was formerly one of our lay readers. Our route from Devonport
  was over a succession of bleak hills overlooking the beautiful
  Hauraki Gulf, by an unmetalled road, in some places scarcely
  more than a roughly marked track, very muddy and slippery in
  the wet season. At the Wade settlement we had the pleasure of
  shaking hands en passant with Mr. Leigh, our excellent lay reader,
  to whom the people are mainly indebted for their little church,
  and with Mrs. Leigh, who was standing at the roadside near their
  house, with a thoughtful present of delicious peaches and a pretty
  bouquet for E.</p>
<p>From the Orewa river we rode (about twenty miles) to Warkworth.
  The road is very hilly, and the heat was great, so that we did
  not travel fast. Most of the way our route was through beautiful
  forest, called "bush" in New Zealand from the quantity
  of undergrowth. Every now and then we got peeps of the sea with
  headlands and islands. We had not time to call at Waiwera, where
  the famous hot springs arc, nor indeed [22/23] anywhere else,
  excepting for a few minutes--to get a glass of milk for E.--at
  Mr. Russell's. We reached Warkworth soon after six p.m., and
  put up at Mr. Such's hotel, which is a clean, quiet, and well-kept
  house. The people of the township seemed to be all away, with
  their children, spending the day on Kawau Island, the home of
  Sir George Grey, who invites the children, with their friends,
  annually to spend a day on his island.</p>
<p>January 29, Saturday.--In the afternoon, at three, we left
  Warkworth on our horses for Tauhoa (about twenty miles), escorted
  by Mr. F. McMurdo, whose father practises as a doctor in this
  district, and whose grandfather is General Sir W. M. S. McMurdo.
  For the first ten miles our route passed through a thinly inhabited
  country, hilly and abounding in forest and fern. Here and there
  small patches of land are being cultivated, and the people generally
  are industrious, but poor. At the Kaipara Flats, a comparatively
  level district, about ten miles from Warkworth, we rested for
  twenty minutes at the house of a Mr. Hood, whose wife was a Miss
  Dibble. Her father was formerly a parishioner of Archdeacon Denison's.
  Mrs. Hood gave us some refreshing home-made cider, and some excellent
  plums and apples. On continuing our journey, we crossed the Hoteo
  river, and then rode for about four miles through a grand forest;
  the track having here and there lying across it huge trees, still
  burning, that had been felled to make a clearance for the admission
  of air and sunshine. In places the newly formed track was scarcely
  safe for a lady on a nervous horse, being very narrow and winding,
  with a deep precipice on the outer side, and alarming blackened
  logs projecting from the bank on the inner [23/24] side. At the
  worst points, young McMurdo, with the instinct of a gentleman,
  put his horse between E.'s and the precipice, so that he would
  have to go over first, if the horses were frightened and in danger
  of falling down the cliff into the river. On emerging from the
  forest, we came out on the fern land of Tauhoa, hilly and desolate
  looking. It was nearly dark when we reached the house of our
  host, Captain Hearne, on the top of a high fern-clad hill, near
  the district school, of which he is the master. We found the
  last two miles of the twenty very fatiguing, over rough ground--in
  places very steep. I learned that Captain Hearne had gone to
  India in 1857, with the 83rd Regiment; that is, a few-months
  before I joined Sir Colin Campbell's army near Cawnpore. He left
  India again in 1863, not having taken part in any of the principal
  engagements of that eventful period, though he was present at
  several of the smaller fights. Captain Hearne has two half-time
  schools, about five miles apart, in one of which there are thirty,
  and in the other about twenty boys and girls. His son Herbert,
  a lad of sixteen years, looked after our horses for us.</p>
<p>January 30, Sunday.--We had a fatiguing walk of about a mile,
  down a rough and very steep track and up another, through the
  fern, to the little Church of the Holy Trinity at Tauhoa. There
  seemed to be no inhabited house nearer than a mile to the building.
  Most of the congregation, nearly seventy, assembled pretty punctually
  at eleven. E. and I sat on the steps outside, resting before
  the service, and speaking to the settlers and their children
  as they arrived. The weather was oppressively hot, though there
  was a refreshing [24/25] breeze and not much sunshine. E. had
  brought a supply of beautiful Scripture cards, and of lollies,
  for the children, by whom both gifts were greatly appreciated.
  The service began with a hymn, which was heartily sung, to a
  harmonium accompaniment well played by Miss Parker. The first
  Lesson was particularly well read by Mr. Green, the excellent
  lay reader, to whom the congregation are greatly indebted for
  conducting the Sunday services during many years. Mrs. Green
  superintends the Sunday School. Their work for the Church involves
  no little toil and self-denial, inasmuch as they live nearly
  four miles distant from the church, and have to travel to it
  by a rough, and, in the winter, muddy, track through the bush,
  bringing their children with them. After the third collect and
  another hymn, Confirmation was administered to eight young people,
  most of whom had been prepared for the rite by Mr. Green. Afterwards
  the Holy Communion was received by twenty-five persons, including
  all the newly confirmed. One of the communicants, a settler partly
  paralyzed, had been brought several miles on a rough sleigh,
  drawn by two horses, <i>over</i> the hills, accompanied by his
  wife on foot. The service was very cheering; but my part was
  fatiguing, as I had to stand nearly all the time. Though I wore
  no cassock, coat, or waistcoat,--under a thin surplice, with
  hood and scarf, the perspiration was dripping from my forehead,
  and my hands were wet from the same cause. We walked back to
  Mr. Hearne's house after the service; and at three set out for
  Wells-ford, ten miles distant, escorted by Mr. F. Boler, who
  carried our two small bags of clothes. These bags are made to
  fasten on to the saddle by a small strap at the [25/26] rider's
  side behind. When I have no companion on these expeditions, I
  carry my robes and everything else that I require for the time
  in one of these leathern bags, and so am very independent. E.'s
  bag, with its contents, for a five days' trip, weighs only fifteen
  pounds. The first three miles of our track was through the fern,
  down the rough and steep faces of high hills, across torrent
  beds with only a little water in them, and up very steep ascents
  or climbs. Indeed, one of the ascents was so precipitous that,
  for the sake of our horses as of ourselves, we dismounted, and
  toiled up in the scorching sun. We reached the house of our kind
  host and hostess, Mr. and Mrs. Dibble, about six o'clock. I refreshed
  myself, as usual, before the evening service by dipping my head
  in a basin of cold water and not drying-it. I do this three or
  four times a day in the summer, when I have much travelling and
  speaking to accomplish, and the result is invariably refreshing
  and invigorating. The evening service at 7.15 was held in the
  small district school-house, about a quarter of a mile from Mr.
  Dibble's. As the sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion and
  the rite of Confirmation were to be administered, we used the
  shortened Evening Prayer. The Lesson was read by Mr. Evan Richards,
  the faithful lay reader who has for several years come five miles
  on Sundays to conduct the service when not hindered by illness.
  After the Lesson I presented a lay reader's licence, in the usual
  manner, to Mr. George Small, who will henceforth assist Mr. Richards
  in his reader's work. I then baptized an infant. Next followed
  the Confirmation of an old pensioner, Charles Griffin, formerly
  of H.M.'s 41st Regiment. He was at Candahar and Cabul [26/27]
  in the first Afghan campaign, in 1842, and now holds a situation
  at the saw-mills, about five miles distant, of which Mr. Small
  is the manager. Mr. Griffin is much respected by all who know
  him. The offertory collection was for the Home Mission Fund;
  from which is paid the stipend of the organising clergyman who
  periodically visits these districts. At the Holy Communion I
  used wine that had been made in the district by Mr. Levett, who
  has a large vineyard. The wine is of various kinds, and is highly
  commended by those who have tasted it, as pure grape juice with
  as little alcohol as possible; the price being 8<i>s</i>. a gallon.</p>
<p>January 31, Monday.--I began the day by buying a horse from
  my host, who had for some time been intending to obtain for me,
  if possible, a suitable steed for my journeys; my old grey being
  now more than twenty years old and scarcely fit for these country
  expeditions. I gave £12 for my new horse, which is about
  seven years old, and sixteen hands high, strong, quiet, surefooted,
  and tawny in colour. We left Wellsford at nine a.m. for Warkworth,
  about fifteen miles distant, most of the way through a grand
  forest, by a winding unmetalled road, over hills and through
  gorges. For more than half the distance we rode through heavy
  rain, which wetted us to the skin, and made the track very slippery
  and unpleasant. E. rode the new horse, to rest her own mare,
  whose back had got a little rubbed on Sunday in climbing and
  descending the steep Tauhoa tracks.</p>
<p>Our man met us at Warkworth in the afternoon, and in the evening
  began his homeward journey with our horses.</p>
<p>[28] At eight p.m. we went to a singing practice of members
  of the Blue Ribbon Army, having been invited, though not members
  of that society, by Mr. McMurdo, who acted as choirmaster. At
  his request, I gave an address to the meeting.</p>
<p>February 1, Tuesday.--We returned to Devonport (about forty
  miles) by the coach, along the same route that we rode on January
  28, and reached Bishopscourt soon after four p.m.</p>
<p>February 2, Wednesday.--I presided at a meeting of the Standing
  Commission, the court appointed by the General Synod of the New
  Zealand Church for the interpretation of the Canons, to consider
  a case submitted by the Diocesan Nominators of the diocese of
  Dunedin. Our ruling amounted to a declaration that in every case
  where a "nomination" to a parochial cure has not lapsed
  to the Bishop by fluxion of time, the Bishop can not legally
  "institute" an incumbent who has not been nominated
  to him for the purpose by the Board of Nominators.</p>
<p>The Standing Commission at present consists of the Bishop
  of Auckland, Chairman; Sir Frederick Whitaker, K.C.M.G., recently
  Premier and Attorney-General of the colony; the Hon. Colonel
  Haultain, formerly Defence Minister; Mr. Hugh Garden Scth Smith,
  M.A., Resident Magistrate; and Mr. Edwin Hesketh, Barrister.
  Mr. Hesketh is at present absent from Auckland, having gone to
  England in 1886 for the benefit of his health. He is considered
  the ablest of our Auckland advocates, and is a clear thinker
  and speaker. He was for many years the volunteer organist of
  his parish church, S. Mark's, where he was a most generous benefactor,
  not [28/29] only by giving largely of his time, but also of his
  money, for the improvement of the choir. On many occasions, the
  Synod and the Standing Committee have greatly benefited by his
  wise counsel, which is often given, after the Socratic manner,
  by asking a few plain and pointed questions. In the evening,
  I presided at the anniversary meeting of the Auckland Sailors'
  Home, of which institution I am to be President so long as I
  remain Bishop of Auckland. The Sailors' Home is at present carried
  on in premises on the Queen Street Wharf, leased by the M Council
  of the Home as a temporary arrangement until the permanent building,
  of which the first pile is to be driven this week, is ready for
  use. The Home is for the social, intellectual, moral, and religious
  benefit of the seafaring community of Auckland. The articles
  of association by which the affairs of the Home are managed were
  drawn up by Sir Frederick Whitaker, who is famed for his great
  ability in such matters. The Home is maintained by the interest
  on £12,150, the bequest of the late Mr. Costley. In 1882,
  I was induced, by the arrival in Auckland of Mr. Fell, who had
  been a seamen's missionary in Liverpool, to begin a Sailors'
  Rest in Auckland, encouraged by the sympathy and help of several
  of our clergy and lay people. We took a room in a shop on the
  Queen Street Wharf, and engaged the services of Mr. Fell. When
  our funds were nearly all expended, in 1883, I sent a communication
  to the <i>New Zealand Herald</i>, one of the principal Auckland
  papers, stating the purposes of the Rest and our want of funds.
  The statement was read by Mr. S. Jackson, who was on April 16,
  1883, sent for [29/30] by Mr. Costley, then on his death-bed,
  to make his will, dividing his property (about £85,000)
  among seven Auckland institutions recommended by Mr. Jackson.
  Of these institutions one was "The Sailors' Home, inaugurated
  or to be inaugurated by Bishop Cowie." The Council of the
  Home have resolved to spend £4000 on the erection and furnishing
  of a suitable building, to be erected on a convenient site next
  to that of the Harbour Board offices, and to invest the balance
  for the maintenance of the Home. It is not likely that there
  will be any great increase in the demand for sleeping accommodation
  in Sailors' Homes in these colonies, as most of the vessels entering
  our ports are steamers, whose stay is short, and whose crews
  are required to be on board at night. The chief work of our Auckland
  Home will be, as I always expected it would, the social advantage
  and the intellectual, moral, and religious improvement of the
  seafaring population.</p>
<p>February 3, Thursday.--The seventeenth anniversary of our
  arrival in Auckland. I have not once been out of the diocese
  for a day's holiday since I entered it; my only absences having
  been to attend the triennial meetings of our General Synod, and,
  in recent years, the meetings of the University Senate, and those
  of the Church Missionary Board, [See page 20.] besides one visit
  to Norfolk Island in 1872, after the death of Bishop Patteson,
  to hold an Ordination and a Confirmation for the Melanesian Mission.
  The progress of this part of the colony, and of our diocese of
  Auckland, has been great during these years. The number of our
  clergy has increased from thirty-seven to seventy-five, and everything
  else, in [30/31] connection with the Church, has progressed in
  proportion. Here and there stagnation has occurred, and in some
  few cases perhaps retrogression, but on the whole our advance
  has been definite and satisfactory. At the present time, none
  of our people, however poor or distantly situated from the centres
  of population, are uncared for by the Church, or unvisited by
  a clergyman. My own duties are greatly increased, especially
  in the departments of visitation and letter-writing. Whereas,
  seventeen years ago, I could travel through the country in comparative
  leisure, staying with settlers and coming to know them well,
  I have now so many congregations to visit that I can rarely leave
  the main road or track on my journeys; and whenever I can I am
  obliged to travel by railway or by coasting steamer, to save
  time. My travelling expenses have increased proportionately,
  and exceed £100 a year.</p>
<p>February 4, Friday.--I went to Cambridge, accompanied by E.,
  travelling the distance (101 miles) in about six and a half hours.
  Here we were the guests of Major and Mrs. Wilson. The oldest
  part of their house was built by Colonel Lyon in 1866, when he
  also planted the trees, of which some are now giants, especially
  the <i>macrocarpas</i>. Of these, the present girth of one that
  I measured, at a height of one foot from the ground, is fourteen
  feet.</p>
<p>In the evening, we attended a social gathering of the Church-people
  in the schoolroom, arranged by Archdeacon and Mrs. Willis, so
  as to give us an opportunity of meeting members of his flock
  whom we could not otherwise have seen. Two hours were pleasantly
  passed with conversation and music. S. Andrew's [31/32] Church,
  Cambridge, is one of the best buildings in the diocese, and is
  our only parish church that possesses a peal of bells. The bells
  are six in number, and cost in all £500, of which sum £100
  were contributed by Mr. Hewitt, a parishioner. Everything connected
  with the Church here bears tokens of the unceasing care and the
  methodical ways of the incumbent, the Rev. W. N. de L. Willis,
  who is also Archdeacon of this division of the diocese. I first
  made the acquaintance of Mr. Willis in 1871, when he was residing
  at Whangai, in the Bay of Islands district. He came to New Zealand
  in 1866, as one of the pioneer settlers of Whangai, where, with
  Mr. Walsh (now one of my chaplains) and other sons of Irish clergymen,
  he took up, and began to clear and sow, land in one of the most
  out-of-the-way parts of the province, without roads or a market.
  Men who could work heartily under such circumstances were, I
  foresaw, the right sort of men for New Zealand clergymen; and
  I confidently recommended Mr. Walsh and Mr. Willis for scholarships
  at our College of S. John the Evangelist. As an indication of
  the rapid progress made by some of our settlements, I may mention
  that in 1871 the Church Committee bought for £10 an acre
  of land next to the church site, which acre was valued at more
  than £200 in 1880.</p>
<p>February 5, Saturday, was spent in clearing off some arrears
  of correspondence, and in other writing. In the evening, we went
  to see our old friends Mr. and Mrs. Wells. Their orchard, not
  six years old, is a sight worth going far to see; their apple,
  pear, and plum trees being laden with fruit of the choicest kinds.
  Mr. Wells has been one of our most generous and useful pillars
  of the [32/33] Cambridge Church. He is a member of the Diocesan
  and also of the General Synod.</p>
<p>February 6, Sunday.--A showery day, after months of drought.
  The thermometer, which stood at 80° in the shade before the
  rain began, fell to 65° in thirty-six hours.</p>
<p>In the morning, at eleven, I preached at S. Andrew's and held
  a Confirmation; Morning Prayer to the third collect being first
  said by Archdeacon Willis. In the afternoon, I went to Cambridge
  West, where I held afternoon service in the district school-house,
  the Archdeacon going to Ohaupo. In the evening, I took the service
  at S. Andrew's; Mr. Dyer, a rising young lawyer, helping me by
  reading the Lesson and giving out the notices. The two collections
  at S. Andrew's to-day, for the ordinary expenses of the church,
  amounted to £5 8<i>s</i>. £<i>d</i>. Considering
  the smallness of the population (about fifteen hundred) and the
  existing commercial depression, that sum will compare favourably
  with the ordinary offerings of a provincial town congregation
  in England. At Cambridge, as at our other country settlements,
  there is no Church endowment for any purpose; the whole cost
  of the maintenance of the clergyman and of public worship being
  borne by the people. It is to be hoped that endowments--to meet
  part of the ordinary expenses of our country churches--will be
  provided, when the sons and grandsons of the original settlers
  have established themselves on their lands.</p>
<p>February 7, Monday.--We spent the morning of this day in letter-writing,
  and the afternoon in paying visits.</p>
<p>February 8, Tuesday.--We left Cambridge in the [33/34] morning
  by train for Morrinsville, where we stayed from eleven a.m. to
  three. On the way we passed a station named Eureka. On a former
  occasion, when travelling this way, one of our fellow-passengers
  said to us, in reference to the name, "It is, I believe,
  an ancient name for a 'shirt,'" he having no doubt seen
  in England an advertisement of "Eureka shirts"! I told
  him the meaning of the word, and he exclaimed, "I don't
  suppose many people know that." At Morrinsville we have
  no church building, but the district forms part of the charge
  of the Rev. James Marshall, whose head-quarters are fifteen miles
  distant, at Te Aroha. Mr. Marshall holds service here on two
  Sundays of each month; and on other Sundays the service is conducted
  by Mr. Ozanne, the excellent lay reader, whose farm is nine miles
  distant. He and Mrs. Ozanne also keep up the Sunday-school.</p>
<p>I may here mention a strange case of mistaken identity that
  occurred when I was at Morrinsville in 1885. E. and two of our
  children came with me by train from Auckland, and there was in
  the same carnage with us a Mr. T------, recently arrived from
  England.</p>
<p>The railway then was not made beyond Morrinsville, whence
  passengers to Te Aroha travelled by coach. On that day, I had
  to remain behind at Morrinsville, to hold a Confirmation, and
  E. with the children continued their journey, accompanied by
  Mr. T------, who sat by the driver. As Mr. T------ was seen to
  give the children some glasses of milk, and to help E. and them
  out of the coach on reaching Te Aroha, it was naturally assumed
  by strangers that he was the Bishop; and, as Professor Black
  (of Dunedin) afterwards told me, Mr. [34/35] ---------- who travelled
  through the district with the professor, was almost everywhere
  addressed as the Bishop. I was afterwards told that on the journey
  to Te Aroha, Mr. T------ had had something to drink at a roadside
  inn; and there are, probably, several persons in the district
  who would take their <i>affidavit</i> that they had seen the
  Bishop drinking something stronger than water on his way to Te
  Aroha.</p>
<p>Our intercourse with "fresh arrivals" from Europe--"new
  chums," as they are called in the colony--is sometimes very
  amusing. Such persons often seem to assume that they are capable
  of instructing all who have arrived before them, even though
  it be but a few months, like persons who have recently taken
  up "religious views," and are ready to "convert"
  those who have led Christian lives for years, "studying
  to be quiet and do their own business." [1 Thess. iv. 11.]
  The late Mr. Swainson used to say that, on the arrival of an
  emigrant ship, he could tell all the newcomers he met in Queen
  Street by the look of conscious superiority to be seen in their
  faces. Not long after my arrival in New Zealand, I was informed
  by a young clergyman, a subsequent arrival, how the clergy dressed
  in London, and that in society, e.g. at a dinner-party, they
  were not expected to wear a dress coat; the latter piece of information
  being of course incorrect. It is not long since a new-comer informed
  me that there was in England a nobleman--Lord Auckland--named
  after our city!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we went on by train from Morrinsville to
  Oxford (thirty-one miles), where we stayed for the night. Here
  the settlers are very few, and we have no [35/36] church building;
  but a Home Mission clergyman visits the district periodically.
  The chief business of the place is in connection with tourists,
  who travel to the Lake district by coach from this station. There
  is a large, well-kept hotel, the landlord being Mr. Rose; who
  told me that last year he had occasionally to supply luncheon
  on one day to seventy travellers, whereas now there are often
  not seven persons at that meal. The falling-off is chiefly owing
  to the eruption of the Tarawera mountain, and the consequent
  destruction of the pink and white terraces there, in June, 1886.
  Many travellers, it is thought, are now afraid to visit such
  a fiery district, and many seem to think that there is no longer
  anything worth going to see at Rotorua. Mr. Rose, the landlord,
  attributes the falling-off partly to the general commercial depression,
  and partly to the recent attractions of the Colonial Exhibition
  in London. Mr. Carter, the driver of the coach, says that comparatively
  very few of the tourists in past years have been New Zealanders.
  I never had an opportunity of seeing the famous terraces, as
  they were not in the diocese of Auckland, and I could not afford
  the time that a visit to them would have cost.</p>
<p>The land hereabouts belongs to the Auckland Agricultural Company.
  It is fairly good land, but the distance from Auckland is too
  great to allow of there being at present many persons desirous
  of beginning farming operations near Oxford. The estate is said
  to comprise 112,000 acres. The original shareholders, who purchased
  the land from the Maories, are likely to be losers, but they
  have done a good work for the colony, and one for which future
  settlers ought to be grateful.</p>
<p>[37] February 9, Wednesday.--In the afternoon, we went on
  by train (eleven miles) to Lichfield, so called in honour of
  the first Bishop of New Zealand, after whom the estate of which
  it is the chief settlement is name "the Selwyn Block,"
  containing more than 280,000 acres. The Maori name of the district
  is Patatere. The railway station, at present the end of this
  branch line (which is to be extended to Rotorua), is said to
  be 750 feet above the sea. The temperature at the time of our
  visit was quite perfect. I have never experienced a more invigorating
  atmosphere since I came to New Zealand than I did here during
  our short stay; for though the sun was very hot, the air was
  dry and fresh. We stayed with Mr. Rich, the chief shareholder
  of the Patatere Company, who took me over the incipient township
  and its surroundings.</p>
<p>In the evening, at 7.30, I held a short service and gave an
  address in the Hall, in which the district school is at present
  carried on. Considering that it was Wednesday night, and that
  the few settlers are hard workers all day, and not accustomed
  to week-day services, the congregation was very good. Miss Rich
  played the harmonium. The ordinary Sunday service is conducted
  by a lay reader, at present Mr. Earl, whose predecessors have
  been Messrs. Halcombe and Rich, successively resident managers
  of the estate. In the Patatere and Oxford districts, one of our
  clergy spends two consecutive Sundays in each quarter his expenses
  and a small <i>honorarium</i> being guaranteed to him by the
  people. This work is at present done by the Rev. Theo. P. N.
  Hewlett, whose zeal and bodily energy, at the age of seventy-two,
  are an example and a stimulus to us all.</p>
<p>[38] February 10, Thursday.--I inspected the proposed church
  site at Lichfield, to be given to us by the Company. It is lot
  No. 464 on the plan shown to me by Mr. Rich, and is conveniently
  and beautifully situated for the township. Considering the distance
  of Patatere from the sea, and its general elevation, the climate
  of the district is, I should think, unsurpassed, perhaps unequalled,
  by any in New Zealand. It appeared to me to be the very place
  for a first-class public school. It is easily accessible from
  Auckland, is not near any large town, and, with its undulating
  and well-watered land, is admirably adapted for the cultivation
  of all manly and healthful sports. The character of the soil
  seems to be generally good. In the neighbourhood of Lichfield,
  which, I was told, is in the quality of the soil rather below
  than above the average of the block, English grasses, vegetables,
  fruits, and trees seemed to flourish as they do in Auckland.
  Notwithstanding all these natural advantages possessed by the
  estate, it is distressing to think that the original shareholders
  of the Patatere Company, who purchased the land from the Maories,
  are likely to be great losers, for lack of purchasers. No better
  work for the colony could be done than to prepare for settlement
  an extensive district of fairly good land like that of Patatere;
  but it may be done-too soon to be profitable, or otherwise than
  ruinous, to the doers of it. The 284,000 acres of this estate
  are said to have cost the company as many pounds, including all
  charges for surveying, etc. With a population of only two-thirds
  of a million in the whole colony, which is about the size of
  Great Britain, there is every prospect of the bulk of the Patatere
  Block remaining for many [38/39] years in the unwilling possession
  of the company, unless they are prepared to make a great sacrifice
  of their property.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we went (fifty-five miles) by train to Te
  Aroha, where we stayed at the Hot Springs Hotel, a well-conducted
  establishment close to the public domain, in which are situated
  the famous baths.</p>
<p>In the evening, about eight o'clock, we sat out in the domain
  enjoying the cool air after the day's heat, and looking up at
  the dark mountain rising to a height of 3200 feet immediately
  behind the township. These grounds (about twenty acres) have
  been well laid out and planted, at the expense of the Government,
  and a number of baths of different kinds have been fitted up.
  The water is heavily charged with carbonate of soda. Carbonate
  of lithia is also present in an appreciable quantity. The water
  is very efficacious in relieving sufferers from dyspepsia, rheumatism,
  sciatica, kidney disease, calculus, sprains, etc. Sir James Hector
  says of these springs, "They are similar to the waters of
  Vichy and Chaudesaignes, in France; Bilin, Bohemia; Ems, Nassau;
  and are besides quite equal to them in strength." Some patients
  bathe three times a day; the evening bath between 8 and 9.30
  being as popular as any. Before our bath at this hour, we went
  up the hill to the fountain, at which we each drank a cup of
  not unpleasant warm soda-water, which was welling up out of the
  ground. The temperature of the water in which we bathed was a
  little over 100°. It occasionally rises to 1140. Each of
  the private baths has attached to it a shower-bath apparatus
  for cold water, a douche of which, after the hot water, acts
  as a preventative from taking a chill. Te [39/40] Aroha is sure
  to increase in fame as time goes on. This season the number of
  visitors is smaller than it was last year; but the falling-off
  is only temporary, and is to be accounted for by the general
  impecuniosity of the colony. The price of bath tickets for private
  baths has this year very unwisely been increased from sixpence
  to a shilling, a charge that many visitors find inconvenient
  to pay.</p>
<p>February 11.--We spent the day in reading and writing. In
  the evening, we went to see the Rev. J. Marshall, the clergyman
  of the district, and his family. Mr. Marshall came to us from
  the disestablished Church of Ireland three years ago, and has
  proved a most valuable addition to our diocesan staff Mrs. Marshall
  and the young ladies are like the best kind of English clergyman's
  wife and daughters, in their helpfulness to him and their influence
  for good among his flock.</p>
<p>February 13, Sunday.--I preached at St. Mark's, Te Aroha,
  morning and evening, and at the latter service held a Confirmation.
  There was a good congregation in the morning, and an overflowing
  one in the evening. The site of the church, which is very central
  and convenient, was the gift of the Maori wife of Mr. Lipsey,
  the daughter of the late Chief Mokena Hou (Morgan).</p>
<p>February 14, Monday.--We returned to Auckland (112 miles)
  by train, the journey occupying nearly nine hours. The remainder
  of that day and nearly the whole of the next two (from 5.30 a.m.
  to 10 p.m.) were taken up in official correspondence.</p>
<p>On the 16th, I paid a visit, by their wish, to J. Caffrey
  and H. Pcnn, in the Auckland gaol, who were [40/41] to be hanged
  on February 21. These men were at the January assizes sentenced
  to death by Mr. Justice Ward, for the murder of Mr. Taylor on
  the Great Barrier Island in June, 1886. In passing sentence of
  death on these men, the judge very appropriately quoted the words,
  His "way is in the sea and" His "paths in the
  great waters" (Ps. lxxvii. 19), and "at His word the
  stormy wind" (Ps. cvii. 25) arose, in reference to the perilous
  voyage of the murderers, in a small vessel in very tempestuous
  weather, from New Zealand to Australia. The judge was captiously
  found fault with for quoting these words; but it was surely most
  suitable that he should do so, in addressing men who professed
  to believe the truth they conveyed--that "the Lord is against
  them that do evil." I saw the prisoners separately, in a
  small room near their cells. They were self-possessed and respectful.
  Caffrey came to me first. After some general conversation respecting
  his position, in answer to a question from me, he said that "his
  hope was in his Saviour," and that he repented of his sins.
  I spoke of the encouragement given to us all by the case of Zaccheus,
  in reference to whose repentance our Lord had said, "This
  day is salvation come to this house." I reminded him that
  the repentance of Zaccheus was not a matter of words and feelings
  only, but of deeds, and showed itself by acts of restitution.
  "If I have taken anything from any man ... I restore him
  fourfold." I asked him whether he had acted in the spirit
  of these words towards Mrs. Taylor, whose husband he had been
  declared guilty of taking from her. He seemed surprised at this
  aspect of the matter, and said that, [41/42] "as God knew
  all, he did not think it necessary to say anything to Mrs. Taylor."
  I said that, though he could not restore her husband to her,
  nor leave her any property to help to maintain her in her bereaved
  condition, he might and ought at least to let her know how grieved
  (if such was the case) he was for the injury he had done her,
  and how distressed he was at not being able to make her any sort
  of restitution. After some further conversation on the subject,
  he thanked me for pointing out to him this part of his duty,
  and asked me to inform Mrs. Taylor that "he was very sorry
  for the injury he had done her." I then reminded him of
  the injury he had done to Mr. Taylor's son and daughters, and
  of the restitution which, if it were possible, was due to them.
  In answer to this, all that he would say was that the other members
  of the family, that is, all but Mrs. Taylor, would not feel their
  loss much. I, of course, remonstrated against such a heartless
  treatment of the matter. I then had some general conversation
  with him on the subject of repentance, reminding him that we
  could not by repentance compound with God for disregarding His
  will, nor make that which we had done as though it had not been
  done, but that it was a condition of mind and heart in which
  alone God's forgiveness could be received.</p>
<p>Caffrey's manner was that of a weak man. Most of what he said
  to me was accompanied by a feeble simpering, which changed instantly
  to a hard, almost stern, look, when I spoke of a desire to make
  restitution as an essential part of repentance. He seemed glad
  to speak to me about himself, and would have said much more than
  he did, had I been able to remain. On [42/43] leaving me, to
  return to his cell, he thanked me for my visit, and shook my
  hand.</p>
<p>H. Penn was then brought to me. His manner was much more sedate
  than Caffrey's. He has generally been described as of a very
  forbidding appearance; but there was something rather attractive
  in the upper part of his face. I spoke to him in the same strain
  as I had spoken to Caffrey. He told me that he had sent a message
  to Mrs. Taylor, expressing sorrow for the injury he had done
  her. I reminded him of the wrong he had done to his own wife.
  He acknowledged his evil conduct in this matter, and said he
  was hoping that she would yet come to sec him, so that he might
  tell her of his repentance. I asked them both whether they had
  thought of the wrong they had done to the colony by putting it
  to a considerable expense, besides the graver evils they had
  committed against it, and whether they had thought of any sort
  of restitution they could make to the people of Auckland. This
  seemed to be a new idea to them, and they asked me in what way
  they could make any kind of amends. I suggested to each that
  he might make a truthful statement of all he had done at the
  Great Barrier, and of anything else that it would be well for
  the authorities to know, without injury being done to others,
  to be published at once, or after February 21. Caffrey said that
  he had already written a true account of his own action in June,
  1886. He said also that he was sorry that his sister had not
  entered the Women's Home when Mrs. Cowie tried to induce her
  to do so. Penn thanked me for my visit, and shook hands with
  me. Both he and Caffrey spoke very gratefully of the ministrations
  of the Rev. J. S. [43/44] Hill, the Church chaplain of the gaol,
  who has been most attentive and helpful to these wretched men.
  In 1874, I saw a good deal of------, in the Auckland gaol, before
  and after he was sentenced to death (by Sir G. Arney, then Chief
  Justice) for the murder of a half-witted woman who lived with
  him. In my last conversation with------, just before he was pinioned
  for execution, he told me that he had poured kerosene on the
  woman's hair, and then set fire to it, and afterwards thrown
  her into the river--to extinguish the flame. He had not intended
  to kill her, he said, and added complacently that his object
  was to "frighten her into confessing her sins," by
  giving her some idea of what hell would be like if she did not
  repent! He did not seem to feel any remorse for his diabolical
  deed, but rather to consider himself an injured person.</p>
<p>February 17.--We left home for the south, travelling by a
  small steamer, the <i>Gairloch </i>(four hundred tons) from Onehunga,
  the port on the west of the Auckland isthmus, about six miles
  from the Auckland harbour, to Waitara, in the province of Taranaki.
  From the Manukau Bar to the Waitara Bar the distance is 114 miles.
  It took us about sixteen hours to accomplish the passage, there
  being a strong southerly wind blowing against us most of the
  way. The'Manukau Bar, just outside our northern harbour on the
  west coast, has rather a bad name, chiefly in consequence of
  the wreck of H.M.S. Orpheus there in the year 1863; but I am
  told that the bar at the entrance of the Mersey would be more
  formidable than that at Manukau, but for the dredging that it
  undergoes continually, at a very great expense to the harbour
  authorities.</p>
<p>[45] February 18.--We were met at Waitara by the Rev. F. T.
  Baker, clergyman of the district, one of our Maori scholars,
  his father having been a clergyman of the Church Missionary Society.
  Mr. Baker's work is at present chiefly among the European settlers;
  the few remaining Maories of the district having been alienated
  from Christianity, by the injuries they consider themselves to
  have sustained from the British Government during the ever-to-be-lamented
  war of 1863.</p>
<p>In the forenoon, we went on (eleven miles) by railway to New
  Plymouth, the chief town of the province of Taranaki, which forms
  a separate archdeaconry of the diocese of Auckland. During our
  stay at New Plymouth we were the guests of the Archdeacon and
  Mrs. Govett, at S. Mary's Parsonage. The Archdeacon is an Oxford
  man and a scholar. He took classical honours in 1841, and came
  to New Zealand as a settler. In 1845, he was ordained by Bishop
  Selwyn, and in 1848 became clergyman of S. Mary's, where he has
  remained ever since, much to the advantage of the people of New
  Plymouth and the surrounding districts. As in other Christian
  graces, so also in that of "distributing to the necessity
  of the saints," he has taught by example as well as by precept;
  the parsonage itself having been built by him at his own cost
  on Church land.</p>
<p>At seven p.m., I preached at S. Mary's, at the usual Friday
  evening service. The archdeacon has the assistance of a deacon.</p>
<p>February 19, Saturday.--The thermometer stood at 77° in
  our room at the parsonage, with a wide-open window, the wind
  being in the north-west.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we returned to Waitara.</p>
<p>[46] February 20, Sunday.--In the morning, at eleven, I held
  a Confirmation at S. John's. The site of this church was given,
  and its design (with working drawings) made, by the first resident
  clergyman, the Rev. Philip Walsh, who also contributed largely
  to the cost of the building. It is ecclesiastically correct,
  and in good taste, like all Mr. Walsh's churches; of which, happily,
  there are several in the diocese. At the service, Morning Prayer
  to the end of the third collect was said by the Rev. F. T. Baker,
  according to our custom at Sunday Confirmations. The service
  was hearty, and the congregation reverent.</p>
<p>It is my endeavour never to detain the congregation beyond
  an hour and a half at a Sunday service. In our New Zealand climate,
  especially in the summer months, that time is as long as most
  people can keep their attention fixed. As it was, I was myself
  in an uncomfortable state of perspiration at the Waitara service,
  before beginning my part, though I wore no satin chimere, but
  only the thinnest of rochets over a light cassock. A heavy black
  satin chimere is certainly a cumbersome "survival"
  that Bishops may well be encouraged to discard in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we drove (about twelve miles) to Inglewood,
  where we have another pretty little church of Mr. Walsh's designing.
  Our road was a great part of the way through interesting forest,
  consisting chiefly of tall kahikitea. The open chaise in which
  we travelled was drawn by a small unshod pony, whose progress
  was not rapid, especially as the road in places was made heavy
  by the drenching showers which fell during our journey. The driver
  informed us that the [46/47] steed had recently been purchased
  for fifteen shillings. In the evening, at seven, I held a Confirmation
  at Inglewood. The little church was crowded, and the service
  was all that one could wish. Mrs. Dymond, who played the harmonium,
  had come four miles for the purpose. Inglewood is one of the
  outlying settlements of the district of the Rev. H. H. Brown,
  who lives at Omata, several miles distant. On the Sunday of my
  visit Mr. Brown had to be with some of his other congregations,
  so that I had not the pleasure of his assistance. He is an Oxford
  man, and came to Taranaki before the war, in connection with
  the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and has remained
  there ever since. In zeal and bodily energy he sets a bright
  example to his juniors, being now past seventy years of age.</p>
<p>February 21, Monday.--We left Inglewood in the morning, and
  reached Whanganui in the evening, 107 miles by railway. We crossed
  the boundary between the dioceses of Auckland and Wellington
  at Stratford, a settlement of increasing importance, not many
  miles from Inglewood. The chief exports from Inglewood and Stratford
  are butter and cocksfoot grass seed, but, at fivepence a pound,
  the former has not recently been very remunerative. The railway
  route in this part of the diocese is very interesting, being
  through dense forest, with the snow-crowned Mount Egmont towering
  up behind the dark-green foliage to a height of 8270 feet. Some
  of our experiences at small country inns have been very amusing.
  At one the landlady sat on her husband's right at meals, and,
  in token of her being above her position, ignored the presence
  of the guests. Neither he nor she met us on our arrival at the
  house, and they [47/48] affected not even to see us, as we entered
  the breakfast-room and took our seats at the table. Still less
  would either of them put out a hand to help us with any of our
  small packages, as, each laden with them, we struggled up the
  stairs to our room. Of course it was not long before we heard
  that they had "failed," and been obliged to leave the
  hotel.</p>
<p>February 22, Tuesday.--Our first visit to Whanganui was in
  March, 1871, on our return from Dunedin, where the General Synod
  was held that year. On that occasion, we travelled by coach from
  Wellington to New Plymouth, about two hundred miles, by a very
  rough road and track, along the coast all the way. E. was the
  first woman who had made the journey. The change that has taken
  place in sixteen years is wonderful. Whanganui was then a poor-looking
  little settlement. It is now very much larger, containing several
  fine buildings, and has a prosperous appearance. The continuation
  of the main street is quite pretty, with its villas surrounded
  by well-grown trees. We called on the Rev. T. L. and Mrs. Tudor.
  He is one of the senior clergy of the diocese (of Wellington),
  and was ordained by Bishop Selwyn in 1847. We also went to the
  college, a Church institution, richly endowed with lands, set
  apart for the purpose by the Government in the early days of
  the colony. Since the estate has yielded a revenue, the college
  has made great progress, under the able direction of the head
  master, the Rev. B. W. Harvey, on whom the Archbishop of Canterbury
  has recently, at the request of all the New Zealand Bishops,
  conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity. Dr. Harvey took his
  B.A. at St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1857, when he [48/49]
  was placed seventeenth among the Wranglers of the year. At the
  college there are now over eighty boarders and seventy day scholars;
  the population of the town being 4901.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we went on by train (sixty-three miles)
  to Palmerston, where we remained the night. Parts of the route
  were very striking, up long ascents and down long descents, by
  ledges cut out of the hillside, with deep gorges full of grand
  forest and fern down below. Some of the curves were very sharp,
  and the train seemed to travel over them faster than was safe.</p>
<p>February 23, Wednesday.--We left Palmerston at 7 a.m., and
  reached Wellington at 12.25, eighty-four miles by railway. The
  last part of the journey, from Paikakariki, was very interesting,
  along the beach, up the rocky coast of the Pacific through tunnels,
  by causeways through shallow bays, and finally down a long descent,
  through tunnelled hills, to the harbour of Wellington.</p>
<p>The University Senate met that day at noon, in the Legislative
  Council Chamber of the huge wooden Parliament buildings. There
  is one ordinary session of the Senate in each year, held in one
  of the chief cities of the colony. The Senate is the governing
  body of the University of New Zealand, and consists of twenty-four
  members, who are Fellows of the University. [The function of
  the University is to examine and not to teach. The expenses are
  met by a statutory grant of £3000 per annum.] Vacancies
  in the body are filled up alternately by the Senate and the Convocation;
  the latter body consisting of all graduates of the University
  whose standing is that of a B.A. of two years' standing at least.
  The Senate [49/50] elects the Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor,
  who are at present Dr. James Hector, F.R.S., and the Rev. J.
  C. Andrew, M.A. The former is quite A I as a scholar in all branches
  of Natural Science, and is highly gifted with the faculty of
  imparting his knowledge to others, not only with definiteness
  and lucidity, but with much charm of manner. Mr. Andrew is a
  good classical scholar, having been a Fellow and a Tutor of Lincoln
  College, Oxford, where he took his B.A. in 1844, being placed
  in the second class <i>in literis humanioribus</i> and in the
  mathematical list. For several years he was a member of the House
  of Representatives, and afterwards was master of Nelson College.
  He has now returned to his sheep run, on the coast to the north-east
  of Wellington. The other members of the Senate are Mr. J. M.
  Brown, M.A., late Snell Exhibitioner of Balliol College, Oxford,
  Professor of English at Canterbury College, Christchurch; Mr.
  F. D. Brown, M.A., formerly Demonstrator in Chemistry at the
  Museum, Oxford; the Rev. D. Bruce, formerly minister of S. Andrew's
  Presbyterian Church, Auckland; Mr. C. H. H. Cook, M.A., formerly
  Fellow of S. John's College, Cambridge, where he took his B.A.
  in 1872, being placed sixth among the Wranglers, now Professor
  of Mathematics at Canterbury College, Christchurch; Mr. O. Curtis,
  Resident Magistrate of Nelson; Mr. F. Fitchett, M.A. of the New
  Zealand University, who obtained first-class honours in Political
  Science in 1880, the first member of the Senate elected by the
  Convocation; Mr. Joseph Giles, M.R.C.S., Resident Magistrate
  of Hokitika; the Hon. M. S. Grace, M.D., a member of the Legislative
  Council of New Zealand; the Rev. [50/51] W. J. Habens, B.A. (of
  the London University), a minister of the Independent body, and
  Inspector-General of Schools; Mr. Duncan Macgregor, M.A. of the
  University of Edinburgh, Inspector of Lunatic Asylums; the Hon.
  Sir G. Maurice O'Rorke, Knight Bachelor, Speaker of the House
  of Representatives, who took his B.A. degree at Trinity College,
  Dublin, in 1852; the Rev. J. Paterson, minister of the principal
  Presbyterian Church at Wellington; Sir James Prendergast, Knight
  Bachelor, Chief Justice of New Zealand, who took his B.A. at
  Queen's College, Cambridge, in 1850; the Right Rev. Dr. Redwood,
  Roman Catholic Bishop of Wellington; Mr. W. Rolleston, late Minister
  for Education, who took his B.A. degree at Emmanuel College,
  Cambridge, in 1855; Mr. G. S. Sale, M.A., late Fellow of Trinity
  College, Cambridge, who took his B.A. in 1854, being placed eight
  in the first class of the Classical Tripos, now Professor of
  Classics in Otago University, Dunedin; the Rev. W. Salmond, D.D.,
  a Presbyterian minister, Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy
  in the University of Otago; Mr. J. Shand, M.A. of the University
  of Aberdeen, Professor of Mathematics in the Otago University,
  Dunedin; the Hon. Sir Robert Stout, K.C.M.G., Premier of the
  Colony and Attorney-General; and myself.</p>
<p>The Senate sits daily from 10 a.m. to 1, and from 2.30 until
  the day's business is disposed of, unless otherwise ordered.
  Much of the work is, of course, done by select committees, of
  which I am a member of two, namely, those (1) for the selection
  of authors and periods for the Arts examinations in 1889, and
  (2) the arranging of the University Calendar.</p>
<p>[52] In November, 1886, the candidates for degrees who presented
  themselves for examination numbered 116; and 318 persons were
  examined for matriculation. The examination papers for degrees
  are at present prepared by experienced examiners in England;
  and those for matriculation by professors of our colonial colleges.
  The M.A. degree is only given after a separate examination, at
  which honours can be taken. It may be said of our New Zealand
  Arts degrees, as Professor Freeman (in 1886) said he hoped would
  be the case with those of Oxford, that "a Bachelor's degree
  is respectable, and a Master's degree honourable."</p>
<p>The absence of college life in connection with our University
  course in most of our cities is a great defect in our system,
  as compared with those of the older universities in Europe. It
  is a common complaint, and not altogether without justification,
  that our young graduates are very often uppish and conceited,
  and not at all improved socially or morally (in the highest sense)
  by their university studies, or, rather, by their having passed
  a series of examinations. As a rule, the easy and cultivated
  manner of English gentlemen cannot be acquired by our students
  otherwise than by association in daily life with many students
  of their own age. It is much to be desired, therefore, that at
  Auckland, and elsewhere in the colony, our wealthier citizens
  should enable the college councils to erect suitable buildings
  in which our students can be lodged; and should endow the colleges
  with scholarships, enabling the gifted sons of poor parents to
  avail themselves of our highest teaching.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of February 23 we went by train (eight miles)
  along the coast of the Wellington Harbour, [52/53] to the Lower
  Hutt settlement, where we took up our quarters at Mr. Pinkerton's
  hotel, a quiet house, the Railway Hotel. We had two roomy apartments
  upstairs, for which we paid only three shillings a day, as we
  were generally absent from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and required
  no waiting upon. For our breakfast and evening meal the charge
  for each of us was one and sixpence; our food being good tea
  with bread-and-butter and fresh eggs. We can recommend this hotel
  to visitors who wish for quiet and cleanliness, and who would
  be content with plain food, wholesomely cooked.</p>
<p>February 24, Thursday.--Between the morning and afternoon
  sittings of the Senate we went to see the Bishop of Wellington,
  the Right Rev. Octavius Hadfield, one of Bishop Selwyn's early
  and most valued coadjutors. Bishop Hadfield was at Pembroke College,
  Oxford, but had to leave England without taking his degree, on
  account of delicacy of health. He was for many years Archdeacon
  of Kapiti in the diocese of Wellington, and in 1870 was consecrated
  second Bishop of that diocese, in succession to Bishop Abraham,
  now Canon of Lich-field. Bishop Hadfield is one of our best Maori
  scholars, a first-rate metaphysician, and a man of accurate and
  extensive general learning. He is, moreover, one of the best
  speakers in our General Synod; and we are all proud of him. Mrs.
  Hadfield is a daughter of Bishop Selwyn's first archdeacon, the
  Venerable Henry Williams, of Waimate, in the Bay of Islands,
  who for many years exercised an extensive influence for good
  among the Maories of the North. With them his memory is still
  fresh, and is cherished with profound affection and reverence.</p>
<p>[54] February 25.--The Senate, after considerable discussion,
  agreed to make Latin a non-compulsory subject in the Arts matriculation
  examination. The chief reason assigned for this change was that
  in the primary schools of the colony Latin is not taught, and
  that every encouragement should be held out to the young men
  and women from those schools to enter on a University course.
  Professor Sale, late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and
  a First Class man, spoke in favour of the change.</p>
<p>February 26.--As the Senate did not meet to-day (Saturday),
  we spent the morning in writing letters for the mail to England,
  and the afternoon and evening in reading.</p>
<p>February 27, Sunday.--This was to have been a day of rest
  to me, after a long continuance of Sundays on which not less
  than two sermons had been preached, besides the discharge of
  other Lord's day duties.</p>
<p>This day, however, proved to be like other Sundays--few and
  far between--on which I had resolved, if possible, to be only
  a member of the congregation. I casually met the clergyman of
  the district on the previous Thursday evening, when he told me
  that he was in a difficulty about Sunday morning, as he had just
  been informed that the Volunteers were coming to church then,
  and he had arranged to be with another of his congregations.
  Would I preach? Of course I could not say "No," under
  the circumstances. E. had thoughtfully brought my medals with
  her, and I therefore wore them on the occasion. [For the capture
  of Lucknow (1858), and the Umbeyla campaign against the Afghan
  tribes (1863).]</p>
<p>[50] We thought I might be able to take a holiday on Sunday
  evening, at all events; but a note was brought to me in the vestry
  at the Hutt, just as I was about to enter the church, saying
  that Bishop Hadfield had met with a serious accident the night
  before, and asking me to preach in the cathedral on Sunday evening.
  Accordingly, we went to Wellington in the evening. It was the
  first Sunday in Lent, and I took as the main subject of my sermon--"Restitution,
  as a note of true repentance." Evening Prayer was said by
  the Rev. Edward Lush, a son of my late friend and archdeacon
  (of the Waikato), the Ven. Vicesimus Lush. Mr. Lush went to England
  in 1880, and in due time took his B.A. degree at Corpus Christi
  College, Cambridge. He was afterwards at Cuddesdon College, and
  was subsequently Curate of Aberdare. The church was well filled,
  and the service was much more hearty than when I took part in
  it a year ago. There was a large surpliced choir of men and boys.
  Among the former was Major Jervois, R.E., a son of the Governor
  and his A.D.C., who also read the Lessons, which he did particularly
  well. S. Paul's, Wellington, is the cathedral church of the diocese,
  and also a parish church, the incumbent being the Rev. John Still,
  M.A. Mr. Still came to New Zealand first in 1872, <i>en route
  </i>to join the Melanesian Mission, with the Rev. J. R. Selwyn,
  the younger son of the Bishop of Lichfield (formerly of New Zealand).
  After seven years of valuable help to the mission, he was obliged,
  on account of his wife's delicate health and his own, to return
  to England in 1880. In 1885, he came back to New Zealand, having
  been invited to accept his present charge at Wellington. [55/56]
  Mrs. Still is the daughter of the late Rev. W. Nihill, one of
  Bishop Selwyn's first European coadjutors in the Melanesian Mission,
  who died on the island of Nengone in 1855. Mr. Still rowed twice
  in the Cambridge boat with Bishop John Selwyn, in the University
  race against Oxford; and the two friends have since then had
  many an adventurous voyage in a small boat (belonging to the
  <i>Southern Cross</i>) among the coral reefs of the South-West
  Pacific. With implicit confidence in one another--one managing
  the sail and the other the rudder--they were accustomed to take
  their little craft through raging surf, which under ordinary
  circumstances would have been quite impracticable for any boat.
  We returned to the Hutt by the 8.40 p.m. train.</p>
<p>February 28.--Senate work from ten a.m. to one, and from two
  p.m. to four. One of the committees on which I served to-day
  was that for the selection of authors and periods for the Arts
  Examinations in 1889; and I was commissioned to read through
  Lucian's "Dialogues of the Dead," and to report whether
  they could be without scandal set among the books in which candidates
  for honours in Arts should be examined in that year. I obtained
  a copy of Lucian in the Parliament Library at luncheon time,
  and at once set to work reading the famous Dialogues.</p>
<p>March 1.--Senate work continued. The fee for admission to
  the entrance examination was raised from one guinea to two, for
  financial reasons. It was thought that one result of this change
  would be to check a growing custom in secondary schools of sending
  in their elder scholars to the matriculation examination, as
  a test of the school's efficiency; for which the examination
  is neither intended nor fitted.</p>
<p>[57] March 2.--Senate work continued. It was proposed by Sir
  Robert Stout that Latin should no longer be a compulsory subject
  of examination for the Arts degree; but the Senate vetoed the
  proposal. In the evening, we went to a conversazione, given in
  honour of the Senate, in the Colonial Museum buildings, by Dr.
  and Mrs. Hector. About eighty guests were present. The museum
  is a credit to the colony, and to Dr. Hector, by whom the various
  collections have been got together and arranged.</p>
<p>March 3.--Senate work continued. The relation between the
  Science and the Arts degrees was arranged.</p>
<p>Miss Nesfield, whose brother I knew in India in 1865, gave
  me some dried flowers from the grave of Brigadier-General Adrian
  Hope, who was killed at Rooyah, on the march from Lucknow to
  Bareilly, on April 15, 1858. I said the funeral service at that
  gallant officer's grave, when many other brave fellows were also
  buried, in a large pit, on April 16, the day after the disastrous
  attack on Rooyah Eort. The column was commanded on that occasion
  by a soldier of experience, who made the great but common mistake
  of English generals, of despising the coloured enemy, and, in
  consequence, sustained a humiliating defeat. Adrian Hope was
  a son of the Earl of Hopetoun, and was one of the most promising
  and popular men in the army. The other officers killed, or mortally
  wounded, on that day were Lieutenants Charles Douglas and Alfred
  Jennings Bramley, of the 42nd Highlanders (the Black Watch),
  and Lieutenant H. Willoughby, of the 4th Punjab Infantry. Among
  the wounded were Major Tombs, of the Bengal Artillery, and Captain
  Cafe, of the Bengal [57/58] Native Infantry. I am intending,
  if I ever have leisure enough, to publish extracts from my journal
  of those days, if only to do honour to the fine fellows with
  whom I was in daily intercourse during the campaign of 1858.</p>
<p>March 4 and 5.--Senate work continued. On the 5th, we had
  luncheon with Captain and Mrs. Medley. He is one of the Governor's
  A.D.C.'s, and was formerly in the navy, having served in the
  <i>Pandora</i> under Lord Alcester (Beauchamp Seymour). Captain
  Medley is a son of the Bishop of Frederickton (Canada), now eighty-five
  years of age; and Mrs. Medley is a daughter of the late Rev.
  R. Taylor, who was for many years a C.M.S. missionary at Whanganui.
  The Bishop met with a strange accident recently, which might
  have been fatal to a man of his age, but from which he has happily
  recovered, owing to his strong constitution. When calling at
  a friend's house, he saw in the room a collie dog, and stooped
  down to pat it. The beast--being of an uncertain temper, after
  his species--sprang at the Bishop's face, in which he made two
  or more bad wounds. The wounds healed quickly, and so far the
  Bishop has not felt any other evil effects of the bites.</p>
<p>March 6, Sunday.--In the morning I preached at .9. James's,
  Hutt, and in the evening in the cathedral at Wellington, my subject
  on both occasions being the Melanesian Mission, this being the
  diocesan day for making collections for that work. [See Appendix
  C, p. 344.] Between the services we dined and spent a few hours
  with Dr. and Mrs. Hector, at their charming home at Petone, about
  six miles from Wellington; the house being built on a low spur
  of the range of hills that borders the harbour.</p>
<p>[59] March 7 and 8.--Senate work continued. In the afternoon
  of the 8th, we went by train to Kaitoke, about twenty-seven miles,
  to see the district of the Upper Hutt and the forest in the direction
  of the Rimutaka. Thousands of acres of fine trees seemed to have
  been burnt recently for clearing purposes. The railway ascends
  from the Hutt river until, at Summit, it attains an elevation
  of about twelve hundred feet. The steepest part of the ascent
  is accomplished by the engine by the help of a central rail,
  on which two horizontal wheels work.</p>
<p>On March 7, a land sale took place at Wellington, of 11,649
  acres of forest, more or less uncleared, in different parts of
  the province of Wellington. The sum realised was £17,277;
  the land being all bought (it was said) for <i>bona fide </i>occupation,
  in lots varying from 27 to 382 acres. The land was sold by the
  Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, and was situated at
  Tokomaru, Shannon, and in the Upper Hutt district.</p>
<p>March 9, Wednesday.--We met Archdeacon Dudley, who had arrived
  the day before from Auckland, on his way to Rangiora in the diocese
  of Christchurch, to see his father, Canon Dudley, who is thought
  to be on his death-bed. The canon is now eighty-one years of
  age, and until quite lately has taken regularly the Sunday services
  in his church. He has for some years been a great advocate of
  total abstinence from all intoxicating liquors. His son, our
  archdeacon, has inherited his father's zeal, self-denial, and
  indomitable energy. Though a man of frail bodily appearance,
  and without an ounce of spare flesh, he scarcely knows what it
  is to rest, and is very rarely unfit for Sunday duty, though
  his church, [59/60] S. Sepulchre's, is large, and not at all
  easy to make one's self to be heard in. The archdeacon is my
  commissary. During his absence from Auckland, that office will
  be held by the Rev. C. M. Nelson, my senior examining chaplain,
  and now one of the senior clergy of the diocese. The archdeacon
  has a good helpmeet in his wife, who is a daughter of the late
  Rev. J. F. Churton, the first clergyman of Auckland, who died
  in 1853. Mrs. Dudley's calm wisdom and gentle but imperturbable
  manner inspire confidence in all who come in contact with her--a
  confidence that grows with increasing acquaintance.</p>
<p>I went to see Bishop Hadfield before leaving Wellington. He
  was in bed, and is likely to remain there for some weeks yet.
  He was in good spirits, and felt that he was getting over some
  of the effects of his fall. He was, of course, very pale and
  thin, but the doctor does not seem to attach much consequence
  to those symptoms. It is a matter of general astonishment and
  rejoicing that the Bishop was not more seriously injured on Saturday
  evening, March 6, when he fell from the top to the bottom of
  a flight of stairs, about twenty feet deep, bruising his back
  severely and cutting his head. He was insensible for about an
  hour and a half.</p>
<p>We left Wellington at 1.45 p.m., and reached Palmerston in
  the evening; all the Senate business being finished except formal
  matters which could be disposed of by a quorum of members resident
  in Wellington.</p>
<p>March 10, Thursday.--We left Palmerston at 6.50 a.m. for Whanganui.
  We were struck by the versatility of the guards of these railway
  trains. Only young men, [60/61] in sound health, with all their
  wits about them, and very active in body, are at all fit for
  the office. One of them, Henley by name, on the train from Palmerston,
  fairly astonished us by his feats of agility; running on ahead
  of the engine, to open and close the points at shunting stations,
  dropping waggons on various sidings, and picking up others to
  be added to the train. We feel that such men deserve the highest
  wages that are given to them, and that pensions should be provided
  by Government for their declining years, when they have expended
  all their bodily vigour in the service of their department.</p>
<p>We arrived at Whanganui in the morning and stayed until the
  following day. The fruit shops here are many, and the fruit is
  abundant and good, but the price is astonishingly high, e.g.
  sixpence for a pound of apples or pears, as at Wellington.</p>
<p>In the evening, we went for a stroll across the bridge to
  the other side of the river. The bridge is of a massive character,
  resting on iron cylinders. It was being erected when E. and I
  first visited Whanganui on our return from the General Synod
  at Dunedin, in March, 1871. A native land court is at present
  being held here, and Maories are to be seen wandering about the
  town all day long. Their small white tents, pitched on the river
  bank, looked very pretty from the bridge in the bright moonlight.</p>
<p>March 11.--We took a room at the same hotel in Whanganui at
  which we stayed on our way to Wellington on February 21. On that
  occasion we were not recognised, and were therefore charged the
  same as other guests were; but this time, in consequence of [61/62]
  being discovered and inquired for by some acquaintances, we were
  distinguished by being required to pay a higher rate for our
  board and lodging. On our asking for the bill before leaving,
  the person in charge said, "I suppose you don't care for
  particulars. It comes to 14s." I looked astonished, and
  said that I did not quite see how it came to so much, as the
  charge for each meal was 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.: tea for two,
  3<i>s</i>.; breakfast for two, 3.<i>s</i>.; bed, 3<i>s</i>. The
  reply was, "You had a cup of tea on your arrival."
  "Yes," I said, "but two cups of tea don't cost
  five shillings." The woman thereupon looked confused, and
  said, "You had the use of a sitting-room, and I thought
  as you were a gentleman you would not mind paying a little more."
  I still looked dissatisfied, especially as the only use we made
  of a sitting-room was, for a short time this morning, to write
  a letter. Moreover, there was no table in the room when we were
  shown into it, and a tiny dressing-table had to be brought for
  us from a neighbouring bedroom. Finally, the landlord's representative
  said, "I will make it 12<i>s</i>., then;" and that
  sum was paid by me, under protest.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we left Whanganui by train, and reached
  Waitara at ten p.m.; and left by the <i>Gairloch </i>for Onehunga
  before eleven. Among our fellow-passengers on the <i>Gairloch</i>
  were many members of the Auckland Volunteer force, returning
  from the annual firing competition, held this year at Christchurch.
  One of them, Captain White, brought away with him the Champion
  Belt. The <i>Gairloch</i> was built for the conveyance chiefly
  of cattle. On this trip there were more than fifty passengers,
  about as many oxen, a good number of sheep, and some packages
  of general [62/63] merchandise. Many of the passengers had to
  sleep on the deck; but, as the sea was smooth and the weather
  fine, the deck was as comfortable for men as the cabins. A faster
  and more commodious boat is now needed for the passenger traffic
  between Waitara and Onehunga.</p>
<p>During our absence, of three weeks and two days, our daughter
  Katharine Vaughan, now nearly fourteen years of age, kept house
  for us. She and her two younger brothers had the companionship
  of our dear friend Mary Amina Maning, the daughter of the late
  Mr. F. E. Maning, who lived for many years in the Hokianga district,
  and was a judge of the Native Land Court. We regard Miss Maning
  as a member of the family, and value highly her friendship; her
  gifts of mind and heart being great, and her knowledge of human
  nature astonishing, considering the comparative seclusion of
  her life. Her extensive acquaintance with modern English literature
  and her rare common sense, combined with originality and independence
  of thought, make her society always entertaining and generally
  helpful.</p>
<p>March 13, Sunday.--We were at the eight a.m. service at S.
  Mary's, Parnell, the parish church nearest to Bishopscourt, where
  I was celebrant.</p>
<p>At the eleven a.m. service I only read the Lessons and gave
  the blessing; the prayers being said and the sermon preached
  by the Rev. C. M. Nelson, the incumbent of S. Paul's, Auckland,
  who was making an exchange with the incumbent of .S. Mary's,
  for that service. Mr. Nelson's case is an instance of what can
  be done for a man by a judicious change of climate. I met him
  in England in 1869, shortly before leaving home for New Zealand.
  He was then in delicate health, [63/64] and was contemplating
  a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, by the advice of his doctor.
  On the recommendation of my old friend, the Rev. E. H. Blyth,
  then of -S\ Saviour's, Croydon, I asked the Bishop of Lichfield
  (who had been commissioned by the Board of Nominators to choose
  a clergyman for S. Paul's, Auckland) to nominate him for that
  charge; which he did. Mr. Nelson arrived in Auckland in May,
  1870; and no one would now think, from hearing him in church,
  that he had ever been threatened with a delicacy of lungs. His
  sermon on this occasion was one of a prescribed "course,"
  and was on S. Paul's words, "Charity vaunteth not itself,
  is not puffed up." [I Cor. xiii. 4.] It was a plain, pointed,
  and practical discourse;.scholarlike and simple; well adapted
  to all sections of his hearers. Mr. Nelson is an M.A. of Queen's
  College, Cambridge, where he was placed in the Second Class of
  the Classical Tripos in 1867. In addition to his proper duties
  as incumbent of a town parish, he has done much good work for
  the diocese in examining candidates for Holy Orders; and has,
  besides, proved himself a useful member of the Board of Governors
  of the Auckland College and Grammar School, and has given much
  help from time to time in examining young people at the principal
  educational institutions of Auckland.</p>
<p>March 14, Monday.--The morning was spent by us, as usual,
  in writing letters, and seeing visitors on matters of business.
  In the afternoon I attended the monthly meeting of the council
  of the Auckland University College. The council consists of eleven
  members; of whom two are the Mayor of Auckland and the chairman
  [64/65] of the Auckland Board of Education, <i>ex officio</i>,
  at present Mr. E. T. Devore, and Mr. S. Luke, respectively. Of
  the remaining nine, six were appointed by the Governor in Council,
  and three were elected by the members of the General Assembly
  resident in the Provincial District of Auckland. As soon as there
  are thirty New Zealand graduates on the books of the college,
  they will elect three of the six members of council now appointed
  by the Governor. The council elect their own chairman annually.
  Hitherto that office has been held by the Hon. Sir G. Maurice
  O'Rorke, to whom the people of Auckland are mainly indebted for
  the existence of the college. The other members of the council
  are the Rev. Robert Bruce, formerly minister of S. Andrew's Presbyterian
  Church, Auckland; Mr. T. B. Gillies, a judge of the Supreme Court,
  to whom the college is indebted for two scholarships endowed
  with £2000; the Hon. Colonel Haultain, of much experience
  in educational matters, one of the oldest and most universally
  respected of our Auckland people; Mr. Edwin Hesketh, of whom
  mention has already been made; the Rev. Alexander Reid, one of
  the senior Wesleyan ministers of the colony, and the Principal
  of the <i>Three Kings</i> College, belonging to that body; Mr.
  H. G. Seth Smith, M.A., the Resident Magistrate of Auckland,
  formerly a Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, and a high
  Wrangler in 1872; Sir Frederick Whitakcr, who took a chief part
  in effecting the establishment of the college, and of whom mention
  has already been made; and myself--one of the three elected by
  the Members of Parliament. The secretarial work of the council
  is done by the Rev. R. Kidd, LL.D., of Trinity College, Dublin,
  [65/66] of whose ability as a logician the late Archbishop Whately
  held the highest opinion. The business of the council to-day
  was of a routine character, and occupied about an hour.</p>
<p>Our college was established in 1882, and is endowed with a
  statutory grant of £4000 a year. It has also a large land
  endowment, from which a revenue of £500 a year has recently
  begun to be received. The college has four professors, to each
  of whom the council pays £700 a year and fees. Of these,
  the Professor of Mathematics is Mr. W. S. Aldis, M.A. of Trinity
  College, Cambridge, where he was Senior Wrangler in 1861; the
  Professor of Chemistry is Mr. F. D. Brown, Hon. M.A. of Oxford,
  of whom mention has already been made; the Professor of Classics
  and English is Mr. H. M. Posnett, LL.D. of Dublin, where he was
  Senior Moderator in Classics in 1877; and the Professor of Biology
  and Geology is Mr. A. P. W. Thomas, M.A., late Scholar of Balliol
  College, Oxford. The work of the college is at present carried
  on in two old buildings--of which one was the court-house of
  the Resident Magistrate, and the other the Admiralty House, built
  as a residence for the senior naval officer of the Australian
  squadron when sojourning at Auckland. The number of students
  now attending lectures at the college is seventy-eight. Of these,
  thirty-four (including eight women) are undergraduates of the
  University of New Zealand. [The first University that granted
  a B. A. degree to a woman was that of New Zealand, and the first
  such recipient of the degree was Miss K. M. Edger, at whose reception
  of her diploma I had the pleasure of being present, in 1877,
  in the Choral Hall, Auckland.]</p>
<p>[67] March 15.--As this was a normal day "at home,"
  I give some details of the manner in which it was spent. We were
  up at daylight. I wrote official letters until eight a.m., at
  which hour, with military punctuality, we ordinarily have breakfast.
  Whilst writing my morning letters I teach our two youngest children--Katharine
  Vaughan and Arthur Preston--Latin and Greek on alternate mornings.
  At breakfast we occasionally have visitors, who come to that
  meal as I cannot find time to speak to them later in the day.
  At 8.30 we all assemble for prayers in the private chapel, which
  we now call S. Barnabas, since the removal of the original church
  of that name from Parnell to Mount Eden. Immediately after breakfast,
  visitors began to arrive, to see me about matters of business;
  and others to see E., and obtain advice or other help in divers
  difficulties. On the Wednesday morning of each week, when in
  Auckland, I am to be found at our Diocesan Office in Queen Street,
  at ten o'clock, for the convenience of clergymen and others who
  wish to see me, but who cannot well spare the time to go to Bishopscourt
  (about a mile and a half from town), with the possibility of
  not finding me at home. As I have been away from Auckland for
  several weeks, I made this my office day. I returned to Bishopscourt
  to dinner at one o'clock, when we had several guests. As one
  of our travelled clergy said recently, "the Bishop of Auckland
  combines the office of consul with that of chief pastor. He is
  expected to befriend and entertain all strangers and new arrivals."
  We rarely dine alone; if only by reason of the many visitors
  from England and elsewhere, who bring us letters of introduction,
  and whom we cannot find time to speak [67/68] to except at breakfast
  or dinner. Such letters of introduction are often sent to me
  by persons I never heard of, and persons who do not know me by
  name, but who know that there is a "Bishop of Auckland,"
  likely to be found at home and willing to befriend strangers.
  ["Vidi necesse esse habere episcopum exhibere humanitatem
  quiscunque venientibus sive transeuntibus."--Augustine.]</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I presided at a meeting of our Standing
  Committee, which is elected by the Synod, and represents the
  Synod when it is not in session. The committee consists of the
  Bishop, <i>ex officio</i> (without whose consent no action can
  be taken by the committee); and five clergymen and seven laymen,
  elected annually by the Synod. Of the clerical members, one is
  the Venerable Robert Maunsell, LL.D., formerly Archdeacon of
  Auckland and Incumbent of S. Mary's, Parnell. He is a graduate
  of Trinity College, Dublin, and came to New Zealand in 1835,
  in connection with the Church Missionary Society. He is one of
  our best Maori scholars; and the Church is greatly indebted to
  him for the Maori version of the Bible, which is mainly the result
  of his learning and industry. The other clerical members are--Archdeacon
  Dudley and the Revs. F. Gould, C. M. Nelson, and G. H. S. Walpole.
  Of Archdeacon Dudley and Mr. Nelson mention has already been
  made. Mr. Gould came to New Zealand from Devonshire in 1848,
  and was ordained by Bishop Selwyn in 1852. His present charge
  is the parish of Otahuhu-<i>cum</i>-Panmure, in the neighbourhood
  of Auckland. For several years he did much valuable work in connection
  with the Home Mission of the diocese, going to neglected country
  districts periodically, to minister to people who could [68/69]
  not maintain a resident clergyman. Throughout these districts
  Mr. Gould's name is a household word, and his visits are held
  in grateful and affectionate remembrance. The Rev. G. H. S. Walpole
  came to us from Truro, in 1882; having been selected for the
  Incumbency of S. Mary's parish, Parnell, by my senior commissary,
  the Rev. A. R. Tomlinson, to whom the nomination of a clergyman
  had been delegated by the Board of Nominators.* Mr. Walpole was
  at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his degree in 1877,
  being placed in the First Class of the Theological Tripos, and
  obtaining an Evans Prize for highest marks in Ecclesiastical
  History and the Greek and Latin Fathers. The Bishop of Truro
  (now Archbishop of Canterbury), writing in September, 1882, said
  of him, "The loss of him will be a grievous one to us all--to
  college, to cathedral, and to me personally; but I scarcely know
  any one whom I could recommend so heartily to the work of Auckland.
  He is an accomplished, well-read man, has had experience in parish
  work as well as in training men for the ministry, is a good musician,
  and a most hard worker in the cause of his Master. His preaching
  is good and sensible, and his views are liberal and comprehensive.
  I cannot imagine where we are to look for any one who can take
  his place with us; but I have no right to keep him from work
  for which he and his future wife are exceptionally fitted. .
  . . He came with me here, as tutor in our Theological College,
  and was first curate and afterwards precentor in our new-born
  cathedral." Mr. and Mrs. Walpole have (if possible) more
  than fulfilled our expectations founded on this high commendation.
  The lay [69/70] members of the Committee are Messrs. Kensington,
  Larkins, Luke, Rawlings, Rice, S. Percy Smith, and H. G. Seth
  Smith. Mr. W. C. Kensington, of the Government Survey department,
  is one of the senior and most efficient of our lay readers. Mr.
  Larkins is another of our lay readers, and has been specially
  helpful to the prisoners in the Auckland gaol. Mr. S. Luke is
  the chairman of the Auckland Board of Education, who is also
  on our staff of lay readers, and gives much valuable help to
  the clergyman of his parish. Mr. Luke is held in high honour
  by his neighbours, and by the many persons with whom he has been
  officially connected, as a straightforward man of business, and
  a single-minded and unselfish friend. Mr. Rawlings is one of
  our best Auckland financiers, and is the "great unpaid"
  of several of our institutions, charitable and literary. Mr.
  Vincent E. Rice is the secretary of the Auckland Board of Education,
  and one of our most zealous and helpful laymen in all Church
  work. He kept his terms at Christ Church, Oxford, and came to
  New Zealand in 1863. Mr. Rice is one of our most scientific musicians,
  and has been of great service to the Auckland Choral Society,
  and to our Diocesan Choral Association. He is the organist of
  .S. Sepulchre's (our largest Auckland church); and the efficiency
  of the choir and the reverent tone of the services there are
  greatly the result of his constant painstaking, and of the cordial
  support that he has for many years given to the incumbent. In
  the opinion of capable judges, Mr. Rice is scarcely to be surpassed
  as an accompanist; and from personal experience I can speak gratefully
  of the devotional aid afforded by his devout performance of the
  [70/71] organist's part in public worship. Mr. S. Percy Smith's
  opinion is of the highest value in all matters connected with
  the valuation and survey of land; and in Church work of all kinds,
  whether diocesan or parochial, his aid is given cordially, and
  is much appreciated. Mr. II. G. Seth Smith came to New Zealand
  in 1881, partly for the benefit of his health, and was appointed
  Resident Magistrate and District Judge of Auckland in 1882. Mr.
  Smith is an M.A. of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was
  fourteenth Wrangler in 1871. He was a Scholar of his college,
  and is a classical and Hebrew scholar, as well as a mathematician.
  He is an excellent lecturer and extempore speaker, and his ministrations
  as a lay reader are highly appreciated by our people generally.
  He has given me personally much valuable help since he came to
  Auckland. The Standing Committee acts as a council of advice
  to the Bishop in matters submitted by him to them; and, among
  other special duties, has charge of the Home Mission Fund of
  the diocese.</p>
<p>After the meeting of the Standing Committee, the evening of
  this day was taken up by writing official letters.</p>
<p>March 16 and the remaining days of this week were occupied
  much as was the 15th. On Thursday, the 17th, was held the second
  of the two ordinary monthly meetings of our Diocesan General
  Trust Board, of which I am chairman; the other members being
  the Rev. R. Burrows, and Messrs. H. Brett, J. Dacre, J. Dilworth,
  T. Kissling, Luke, Pierce, and Upton. Mr. Burrows is one of the
  senior clergy of the Church Missionary Society, and was until
  recently their local secretary, in which office, during many
  years, he did valuable work [71/72] for the Society. Though now
  past threescore years and ten, he is always ready to help his
  younger brethren in the Sunday services, even when a journey
  or a voyage by sea is involved in giving such assistance. Mr.
  Brett is an accomplished musician, and is the owner of one of
  the principal Auckland daily papers, and of one of the largest
  and best-managed printing establishments in the colony. Mr. Dacre
  is one of our chief authorities in matters connected with the
  purchase of land, and gives the Board the benefit of his valuable
  advice in rendering the trust property as profitable as possible.
  The same may be said of Mr. Dilworth, who is one of the oldest
  of our Auckland settlers, and is one whom I have always found
  a warm-hearted, sympathising friend. Mr. T. Kissling is a son
  of the first Archdeacon of Auckland (then styled of Waitemata),
  a highly respected clergyman of the Church Missionary Society,
  a German by birth. Mr. Kissling has given me much help during
  my episcopate, in matters in which a sound legal opinion was
  needed. Mr. Luke has already been mentioned. Mr. Pierce may be
  described as the ever-ready friend of all who are in need of
  sound advice and other help, to the utmost of his ability. He
  is known to almost every one in Auckland who has been resident
  there for any time, and is most respected and beloved by those
  who know him best, as a scrupulously honourable man and sincere
  friend. To the community in general he is the worthy representative
  of the Masonic body; and among Church-people his good deeds in
  connection with our Orphan Home, during the whole course of its
  existence, are in particular held in high honour. But to specify
  all the deserving causes that he has aided, with money [72/73]
  or otherwise, would be to name most of the Christian undertakings
  of the diocese since he became a resident in Auckland. Mr. Upton
  is one of our best men of business. He is a clear thinker, and
  is able to express his thoughts in plain and forcible language.
  He has given our Trust Boards and Standing Committee much valuable
  assistance during many years, especially in financial matters.</p>
<p>This Board of trustees is charged with the administration
  of very valuable estates, of which the gross value .at present
  is estimated at about £57,727. These estates include the
  Bishopric endowment, the Native School endowment, the Native
  Pastorate endowment, the General Diocesan endowment, and the
  church and parsonage sites of the diocese. Our secretary is Mr.
  W. S. Cochrane, who is also the secretary of our other Trust
  Boards, and of the Standing Committee. He is the <i>beau ideal
  </i>of a secretary, painstaking, accurate, punctual, and of few
  words. The soundness of our financial position is greatly due
  to Mr. Cochrane's ability and zeal; and I am personally much
  indebted to him for relieving me of anxiety in all departments
  of Church work with which he is specially concerned.</p>
<p>March 25, Friday.--I went to the Thames (a five-hours' passage
  by sea from Auckland), accompanied by our daughter. By the same
  steamer went Archdeacon Clarke and Mrs. Clarke, Miss Maning,
  and some of our Maori clergy, namely, the Revs. Renata Tangata
  (one of my chaplains), Matiu Kapa, Hare P. Taua, Reihana Kaamiti,
  and Rupene Paerata; also some of our principal Maori laymen of
  the north, including Ihaka te Tai, a Chief of the Ngapuhi tribe
  and member of the [73/74] House of Representatives, Paora Tuhaere,
  the Orakci Chief of the Ngatimaniapoto tribe, and Hemi Keepa
  Tupe, of Whangaroa. The purposes of my visit were to admit to
  Deacon's Orders a Maori chief named Hone Papahia, and to preside
  at a meeting of our Native Church Board. The course of a steamer
  from Auckland to the Thames is through the Hauraki Gulf, between
  the mainland and a succession of picturesque islands--a stretch
  of sea quite perfect for yachting. At the Thames--the principal
  goldfield of the North Island--I was the guest of my kind friends,
  Dr. and Mrs. Payne, with whom I have stayed many times when on
  visitation. Dr. Payne is quite an enthusiast in his own noble
  calling, and it is always interesting and instructive to have
  a talk with him on medical subjects. Mrs. Payne gives much of
  her time and attention to those who are in trouble--in mind,
  body, or estate.</p>
<p>March 26, Saturday.--The day was spent in receiving visitors,
  and making arrangements for the Ordination to be held on the
  following day. In the afternoon, I had a conference with the
  clergy in S. Georges Church. Besides those who came with me yesterday,
  there were present also the Rev. F. G. Evans, the clergyman of
  S. George's, and the Rev. W. Turipona, Maori clergyman of the
  district. In the evening, three more Maori clergymen arrived,
  two from the Waikato archdeaconry, viz. the Revs. Heta Tarawhiti
  and Hohua Moanaroa, and the Rev. W. te Paa from Hokianga in the
  north.</p>
<p>March 27, Sunday,--The Ordination Service at ,S. George's
  began at eleven o'clock, Morning Prayer (in English) having been
  said at ten. The arrangements for the Ordination at S. George's,
  made by the Rev. [74/75] F. G. Evans and his churchwarden, Mr.
  Martin Lush, were excellent. The clergy--nine Maories and three
  Europeans--entered the church in procession by the west door,
  whilst "The Church's one foundation" was sung in Maori
  and English; some of our best English hymns having been translated
  into Maori by Mr. Edward Williams and others, in the same metre
  as the originals. The congregation consisted of two hundred Maories,
  to whom were given the front seats in the nave, and about five
  hundred Europeans. An excellent sermon was preached by the Rev.
  Renata Tangata, one of the senior Maori clergy, who received
  Deacon's Orders from Bishop Selwyn in 1860, and Priest's Orders
  from me in 1871. The Litany was said by the Rev. W. Turipona,
  the Commandments were read by the Rev. H. P. Taua, and each of
  the other Maori clergy took some part in the service; I being
  celebrant, and the archdeacon and two of the Maori clergy assisting
  me at the administration. The Maori admitted to Deacon's Orders
  was Hone Papahia, of the Rarawa tribe, one of the principal Chiefs
  of the Hokianga district. He is about thirty years of age, tall
  and dignified, one of Nature's gentlemen, and highly respected
  by all who know him. He was for three years at Gisborne College,
  where he was systematically taught, under the direction of Archdeacon
  Williams, an excellent Maori scholar, a sound theologian, and
  a devoted missionary. Hone's head-quarters are to be at Waiparera,
  where the Rev. Piripi Patiki lived until his death, in 1881.
  There are now fourteen Maori clergy in this diocese, making an
  increase of nine since the year 1870. In connection with most
  of the districts of these clergy there is an endowment for the
  maintenance of the [75/76] clergyman, given chiefly by the Maori
  congregations. The English choir of S. George's, in kindly feeling
  towards the Maories, had practised carefully the hymns in Maori
  the night before, with the help of Archdeacon Clarke; and at
  the service the singing was well led, and was congregational
  and hearty.</p>
<p>At 1.30, all the clergy and the Maori synodsmen were entertained
  at dinner at Parawai by Taipari, the principal Maori Chief of
  the district.</p>
<p>At three p.m., there was service in the Maori Church of the
  Holy Trinity at Parawai, the sermon being preached by the new
  deacon, the Rev. Hone Papahia.</p>
<p>In the evening, at 6.30, the rite of Confirmation was administered
  at S. George's to forty Europeans. The arrangements made by Mr.
  Evans were, as usual, as good as possible. The church was crowded,
  about eight hundred Europeans being present. Most of the Maori
  clergy who had been present in the morning were with me in the
  chancel. The day's offerings at J?. George's, without any appeal,
  amounted to £15, of which £10 was given to the Maories,
  as a contribution to the fund for defraying the expenses of the
  Church Board meeting.</p>
<p>Mrs. Payne thoughtfully gave me carte blanche to invite, in
  her name, as many of the Maories as I thought proper to supper
  after the evening service.</p>
<p>March 28, Monday.--The Native Church Board met at Parawai
  in the Church of the Holy Trinity at eleven o'clock. This church
  was consecrated by me on May 18, 1886. The building was not only
  paid for almost entirely by the Maories themselves, but was erected
  by members of the congregation. Our General Synod has provided
  by a canon (Title B, Canon III. 3) for the [76/77] constitution
  and the meeting of these Boards. Their function is to attend
  to the interests of the Maori population within the boundaries
  of the district represented by the Board. The first such Board
  meeting in the diocese of Auckland was held at the Thames in
  1872. The Venerable Edward Bloomfield Clarke, B.D., has been
  mainly instrumental in organising our Native Church Boards, he
  having been for many years our only travelling European missionary
  to the Maories of the northern districts of the diocese. In acknowledgment
  of his devotion to the Maori race, and of the excellent work
  he has done for it during twenty-seven years, the Archbishop
  of Canterbury conferred on him in 1882 the degree of Bachelor
  of Divinity.</p>
<p>The proceedings of our Maori Church Boards are conducted in
  the most orderly and businesslike manner.</p>
<p>On this occasion, as usual, the roll of the members of the
  Board was called by my chaplain, the Rev. Renata Tangata. Eleven
  clergy and twenty-eight laymen answered to their names; of these
  some had travelled two hundred miles to attend the meeting. I
  then declared the Board duly constituted, and said the customary
  prayer for unity and charity. The Rev. M. Kapa and Wiremu te
  Waha were elected secretaries, and took their seats at a table
  near that of the president. Archdeacon Clarke sat on my right
  hand, and the Rev. Renata Tangata on my left, at a table placed
  in front of the chancel rails. The first motion brought forward
  was that the Rev. F. G. Evans be invited to sit with the Board,
  which was carried unanimously. Many notices of motion were then
  given; and the remainder of the time, until the interval for
  dinner, was occupied by [77/78] giving in to the secretaries
  the financial statements of the several congregations. At one
  o'clock, dinner was served in a long marquee near the church,
  for all members of the Board, and for many other guests, European
  and Maori. Joints of good meat and dishes of fine eels, with
  abundance of vegetables (including kumara and taro), all well
  cooked, were ranged down the middle of the long table. The wives
  of the principal Thames people, with the help of some of the
  younger men, waited diligently on the guests, taking care that
  all had as much to eat as they wished for, and supplying good
  tea <i>ad libitum</i> to all. There was no hurry and no noise,
  but no time was wasted. Many of the guests had their dinner out
  in the open, forming picturesque groups on the grass. It was
  a day of brilliant sunshine, with a fresh breeze from the sea,
  and everything looked its best. At half-past two, the Board reassembled
  for business, when motions, of which notice had been given, were
  considered and put to the vote. The Board adjourned at 5.30 until
  next day, when Archdeacon Clarke presided, as I had to return
  to Auckland.</p>
<p>March 29, Tuesday.--I reached Auckland at two p.m. from the
  Thames, and left again in the evening for Mangawai, accompanied
  by E. We went by coasting steamer to Marsden Point, at the mouth
  of the Whangarei river (about sixty-five miles), taking our horses
  with us.</p>
<p>March 30, Wednesday.--We reached Marsden Point about two a.m.,
  and at six landed with our horses. E.'s horse, a tall black beast,
  had got much hurt on the steamer. His back was badly cut by the
  chain of the horse-box, and he had received other wounds on the
  head and legs, besides having his hair rubbed off [78/79] behind.
  The immediate neighbourhood of Marsden Point consists of sand-hills;
  and there is only one house, the inhabitants of which were asleep
  when we landed. We had therefore no one to help us, and it took
  us more than an hour to feed and saddle our horses, and to make
  a start. On our way to Waipu, through a bleak and barren district,
  we passed through a straggling encampment of gum-diggers. The
  gum is that of the kauri pine, and is found wherever there have
  been kauri forests, which formerly extended over a great part
  of the north of this island. [<i>Lamarara Australis</i>.] The
  gum is used for making varnish. The diggers come from all sections
  of the community. At the present time many sons of our poorer
  settlers, who cannot obtain other remunerative employment, are
  engaged in this digging, by which they can generally earn about
  two pounds a week. In ordinary times many of the diggers are
  men who have "seen better days," and who spend their
  money as soon as they get it, in the purchase of intoxicating
  liquors, often of a very inferior kind. We reached Waipu at 10.30
  a.m., after a ride of about thirteen miles. Waipu is a very poor
  district, about sixty miles north of Auckland, first settled
  in 1854 by immigrants from Nova Scotia, nearly all of them being
  Presbyterians. The district does not seem to have made much progress
  during recent years, as the young men leave home in quest of
  remunerative employment, and the seniors are unable alone to
  effect improvements on the land. After the long drought, good
  water for the cattle and for household purposes was scarce at
  the time of our visit. We stayed at a boarding-house kept by
  a Mr. McDonald. [79/80] Our bill for ourselves and our horses
  for nearly twenty-four hours was only thirteen shillings.</p>
<p>March 31, Thursday.--We started from Waipu on our horses at
  eight a.m., and, after two hours' ride, reached the house of
  Mrs. McClellan, at the Cove, a very beautiful spot on the coast,
  near Bream Tail. There we rested for an hour or so, and had some
  refreshment; and before we left we were overtaken by the Rev.
  L. L. Cubitt, who was on his way from Whangarei to Mangawai,
  accompanied by Mrs. Cubitt and Mrs. Boult. That he could make
  this journey in a large waggon with two horses is a token of
  the improvement in the roads of the district. In Mr. McClellan's
  house I baptized Ella Mildred, the infant daughter of Mrs. Wilkie,
  who was staying there. As an instance of the small profit to
  be made out of land in those parts at present, Mrs. McClellan
  told us that twopence a pound was all that she had been offered
  for her butter, which we tasted and found very good. About noon,
  we set out again for Mangawai, where we arrived soon after four
  o'clock. Our route lay for several miles through a beautiful
  gorge. The road winds along the steep bank of a clear stream,
  from which, on both sides, the hills rise to the height of several
  hundred feet, and are covered with dense forest. On emerging
  from this forest, we came upon a hilly, bleak, and almost uninhabited
  country, covered with low fern and manuka, through which the
  track was very rough for some miles.</p>
<p>The weather was perfect for riding, and we enjoyed the journey
  very much; but we were glad to reach the house of our kind hostess,
  Mrs. Ryan, where we had stayed before. The late Mr. Ryan came
  to New [80/81] Zealand from Dublin in the early days of the settlement,
  and for some years was one of our lay readers at Hakaru (Mangawai).
  A large party had arrived in the morning from Auckland, to be
  at the opening service of the new church on the following day.
  The Misses Tutin at the Parsonage found accommodation for several
  guests. The late Mr. Tutin came, with his family, from England
  in 1860, and was appointed lay reader for this district by Bishop
  Selwyn, who built a small house on the Church land at Hakaru,
  styled the Parsonage, in which Mr. Tutin lived until his death
  in 1872. Mrs. Tutin was afterwards allowed the use of the house;
  and since her death the Misses Tutin have been allowed by the
  trustees to occupy it at a nominal rent, in consideration of
  the good work for the Church that has been done by them for many
  years, chiefly in connection with the Sunday school. Their brothers
  also, Messrs. S. and J. Tutin, deserve well of the Church-people
  of the district, for the care they have taken of the cemetery,
  which is a model of neatness, and of the Church property generally
  at Hakaru. It is mainly owing to the energy of the Misses Tutin
  that the necessary funds have been obtained for the erection
  of the new church, which has cost about £150.</p>
<p>Among the Auckland visitors at the Parsonage were Mr. T. Webb,
  the organist of S. Barnabas' Church, and several members of his
  choir; also Mrs. Tilly, Mrs. Somerfield, and Mrs. Revitt.</p>
<p>April 1, Friday.--Was a great day at Hakaru, and had long
  been looked forward to. Friends from great distances and from
  all directions assembled in the afternoon for the opening of
  S. Michael's Church, which [81/82] began at three o'clock. The
  first part of the Evening-Prayer was said by the Rev. F. Gould,
  who had come with the Auckland visitors; the Lessons being read
  by the Rev. L. L. Cubitt, minister of Whangarei, and the Rev.
  C. A. Tobin, deacon, assistant-minister of the district. The
  sermon was preached by me. The singing was hearty and good, and
  the service generally was bright and edifying. After Evening
  Prayer I baptized three children, at the special request of their
  parents. This service began with the hymn, "In token that
  thou shalt not fear," led by E. The amount received during
  the day for the Building Fund, including the offerings at the
  service, was £22 18<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. In the course of
  my sermon I spoke of the debt of gratitude due to "our good
  sisters Sarah and Elizabeth Tutin," for their indefatigable
  exertions in connection with St. Michael's. A cordial "hear,
  hear," was almost unconsciously given by a number of men
  standing in the porch.</p>
<p>In the evening, at 7.30, I gave a lecture in the hall, on
  "The Extent of the British Empire, and the Opportunities
  enjoyed by Young British Subjects at the Present Time."
  The lecture was followed by a concert. Both were attended by
  as many people as could find room in the building. These gatherings
  do much indirect good in the country districts, in which the
  settlers have few opportunities of meeting, and are therefore
  liable to become estranged from one another, by groundless rumours
  of mutual detraction that often exist in thinly inhabited regions.</p>
<p>April 2, Saturday.--The diocese sustained a greater loss,
  in consequence of a grievous mistake that was made on this day
  at a house in Parnell, than has ever [82/83] before happened
  to it, by the death of two of our Maori clergy, the Revs. Renata
  Tangata and Rupene Pacrata, and a principal Maori layman, Ihaka
  te Tai. Ihaka's wife, Lucy, died a fortnight after her husband,
  her end being hastened by grief for him. All this trouble came
  upon our people as follows. On their return from the Church Board
  Meeting at the Thames, many of the Maori members had to stay
  in Auckland a few days, waiting for the steamer to take them
  northwards. Several of them were invited to dinner on this day
  by a friend in Auckland, on whose table there was, among other
  dishes, a pie containing meat that had been taken from a tin
  some days before, containing also potatoes that had been cooked
  two days before, the whole being covered with pastry in which,
  it was said, no vent was made. Besides the three Maories who
  died, other Maories, clergy and laity, were at the entertainment,
  and the Revs. W. Beatty and G. H. S. Walpole. Mr. Beatty was
  the only guest who partook of the pie with impunity. Mr. Walpole
  and several others, including the hostess, were very ill, some
  of them being for a long time incapacitated for work. This great
  trouble came upon us like a thunderbolt on our return to Auckland.</p>
<p>In the morning, we rode to Kaiwaka, about six miles, accompanied
  by the Rev. C. A. Tobin and Miss E. Tutin. The district is hilly,
  treeless, and desolate, the prevailing vegetation being poor
  fern and low manuka. At Kaiwaka, we rested a couple of hours
  at the house of Mrs, Clayton, whose hospitality to the travelling
  clergy is cordial and unlimited. Her son, Mr. Clark, helped us
  with our horses. In the afternoon, we continued our [83/84] ride
  (about nine miles) to Maungaturoto, accompanied by Miss Ilargreaves,
  who had ridden about ten miles by herself before joining us,
  to be present at her brother's Confirmation on the following
  day. The road was alive with black crickets most of the way,
  as it was yesterday. This is generally the case on our clay lands
  at the end of a very dry summer. We reached the house of our
  host, Mr. W. H. Snelling, just before dark, and in a heavy shower,
  and received a kind welcome from him and his son and daughters;
  Mrs. Snelling being absent on her way to England. Mr. Snelling
  was for many years in the Control Department of the Admiralty
  Office in London, and came to New Zealand some years ago. He
  is one of our lay readers for this district, and has taken a
  principal part in the erection of the church, for which he obtained
  much help from friends in England. April 3, Sunday.--The Maungaturoto
  church, Holy Trinity, was crowded at eleven o'clock, many persons
  having come from a distance. The original church, built in 1884
  on a site given by Mr. Snelling, was burnt down in February,
  1885, by an incendiary, there was too much reason to believe;
  indeed, it is an open secret that some members of a family--not
  Church-people, of course--living in the neighbourhood knew all
  about it. By means of the insurance money, a "compassionate"
  contribution from the Society for the Promotion of Christian
  Knowledge, and help from many sympathising friends, the church
  was rebuilt in 1886, on a somewhat larger scale, and opened by
  Archdeacon Dudley. Morning Prayer to the end of the third collect
  was said by Mr. Tobin, the Lessons being read by Mr. Snelling.
  The Confirmation followed, after a hymn. Those admitted [84/85]
  to the rite were from the surrounding districts, no candidate
  having come from Maungaturoto--an unhappy circumstance, to be
  accounted for partly by the fact that this was originally a "special
  settlement" of Nonconformists, whose misunderstanding, and
  consequent misrepresentation, of Catholic usages has affected
  many of our Church-people. Mr. Tobin had taken great pains with
  those whom he presented, as he had with all his other duties,
  and the service was devotional, edifying, and encouraging. The
  Holy Communion was afterwards celebrated, all the newly confirmed
  remaining to it. Mr. Tobin's head-quarters are at Paparoa, ten
  miles distant, the centre of a very extensive charge, stretching
  across the island from sea to sea. It is at least three hundred
  square miles in extent, including the settlements of Matakohe,
  Pahi, and Te Arai, besides those already mentioned. To see anything
  of his scattered flock in their homes, the clergyman needs to
  pass much of his time in the saddle. His predecessor told me
  that he rode one hundred miles a week on an average.</p>
<p>A large party assembled at Mr. Snelling's at one o'clock to
  dinner, including Mrs. Clayton, who, though sixty-seven years
  of age, had ridden nine miles to the service; Mr. Skelton, from
  Paparoa; and Mr. Linnell, from the Otamatea. At 2.30 p.m., we
  set out for Waipu, where we arrived just in time for evening
  service at 7.30. We rode through the Maungaturoto Gorge, a beautiful
  pass through the forest, along the right bank of a stream running
  towards the east coast through a winding, rocky channel. After
  leaving the gorge we came upon open country, cut up into small
  farms, chiefly of poor land. On our way, we called to see Captain
  and Mrs. Jacobs. [85/86] He was formerly the skipper of the <i>Southern
  Cross</i>, Melanesian Mission vessel, and was in charge of the
  schooner when Bishop Patteson was murdered at Nukapu on September
  20, 1871. In 1872, at the request of the acting head of the Mission,
  the Rev. R. H. Codrington, Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford,
  I made a voyage in the <i>Southern Cross</i> to Norfolk Island;
  where I admitted to Deacon's Orders three Melanesians, R. Pantutun,
  H. Tagalana, and E. Wogale, and held a Confirmation. On that
  trip Mrs. Jacobs accompanied her husband, and I had an opportunity
  of becoming acquainted with her superior mental endowments. The
  Waipu service was held in the only house of prayer of the district,
  which was courteously offered to me by the Rev. G. Jones, temporarily
  in charge of the congregation, consisting almost entirely of
  Presbyterians. I used the shortened order of Evening Prayer,
  the worshippers being for the most part without Prayer-books
  and unacquainted with our forms. In reference to this service,
  my friend, the Rev. R. McKinney, Presbyterian minister of Mahurangi,
  afterwards said to me, "They will be having you up before
  the Primate for irregular ministrations." Mr. Jones has
  since been appointed to the permanent charge of the Waipu congregation.
  He was formerly a minister of the Congregational body in Wales,
  and came to New Zealand a few years ago.</p>
<p>April 4, Monday.--We rode back to Marsden Point in the afternoon,
  and returned to Auckland by the S.S. <i>Wellington</i>, reaching
  home some hours after midnight.</p>
<p>April 5, Tuesday.--A busy day of correspondence and interviews.
  At 3.30 p.m., I presided at the ordinary [86/87] monthly meeting
  of the trustees of the Melanesian Mission estate, which this
  year has yielded a net income of about £1680, property
  tax (£142) having been paid in 1887 for the first time.
  [Valued at £36,279, including Bishop Patteson's legacy
  of £13,330, and the accumulated insurance of the <i>Southern
  Cross</i>, viz. £2220.] The trustees pay over the revenue
  to the treasurer of the Mission, the Ven. Archdeacon Dudley;
  and the treasurer's account, in the Union Bank of Australia,
  is operated on by him and myself. The other trustees of the estate
  are Archdeacon Dudley, Mr. A. Heather, Mr, T. Kirsling, and Mr.
  Upton.</p>
<p>Archdeacon Dudley was formerly a member of the Melanesian
  Mission staff, and was a favourite pupil of Bishop Selwyn and
  Bishop Patteson. The members of the Mission staff wished him
  to be their Bishop after the death of Bishop Patteson in 1871;
  but he declined the responsibility, mainly, I believe, from a
  feeling that his health was not sufficiently robust for the office.
  His early advantages, as a trusted coadjutor of those highly
  gifted men, have borne good fruit, to the great benefit of the
  whole diocese of Auckland, throughout which he is held in the
  highest esteem, and to his own parish, S. Sepulchre's, in particular,
  where he is respected and beloved by men, women, and children,
  and by other Christian people, as well as by those who avail
  themselves of his ministrations. The late Mr. Swainson, formerly
  Attorney-General of the colony, once said that Archdeacon Dudley
  was the best Auckland memorial of Bishop Patteson. Mr. A. Heather
  is a well-known Auckland merchant, a good man of business, and
  one who is always ready to help in Church work.</p>
<p>[88] April 6, Wednesday--I presided at a conference held in
  a room of the Young Men's Christian Association, to consider
  what could be done by the Christian community of Auckland to
  discourage immorality and cherish Christian principles among
  the more neglected section of Auckland young men. The meeting
  was attended by Archdeacon Dudley and other clergymen, and by
  ministers of several of the denominations. The Rev. R. Bavin,
  of the Wesleyan Methodists, took a principal part at the meeting.
  Mr. Bavin is a man of wide sympathies, and of a conciliatory
  manner, and is pleasant to have to do with. I had to leave before
  the end of the conference, and the resolutions agreed to were
  not quite in the form that I liked. The result of the meeting
  was that on the following day I was one of a deputation to the
  Premier, Sir Robert Stout (who happened to be in Auckland)--the
  others being the Rev. R. Bavin and the Rev. G. B. Monro, Presbyterian
  minister--to ask him to use his influence in Parliament (i) to
  raise the age of "legal consent" on the part of girls,
  (2) to make the employment of barmaids illegal, and (3) to render
  it less easy to keep houses of ill fame. With respect to the
  second of these objects, the Premier thought the best means of
  attaining it would be to limit the number of hours during which
  barmaids may be legally employed, and so to render their employment
  unprofitable.</p>
<p>At four p.m., the foundation stone of the Sailors' Home was
  laid by me, on a very good site given by the Harbour Board, next
  to their own offices. The council of the Home, of which I am
  president, are going to spend on the building and its furniture
  £4000, part of [88/89] the legacy of £12,150 which
  the late Edward Costley, of Auckland, bequeathed to "the
  Sailors' Home being inaugurated, or to be inaugurated, by Bishop
  Cowie." On April 15, 1883, Mr. Samuel Jackson was instructed
  by Mr. Costley, then moribund, to make his will, leaving his
  property to Auckland institutions recommended by Mr. Jackson,
  who, on April 10, had seen in the <i>New Zealand Herald </i>a
  paragraph (written by me) stating the want of funds from which
  the "Sailors' Rest," established by me (with the help
  of a few friends), was suffering. Mr. Jackson, being specially
  interested in the welfare of sailors, had been impressed by my
  statement, and in the exercise of his good judgment inserted
  the words quoted above in Mr. Costley's will. The Sailors' Home
  is managed by a council, of which I am to be president as long
  as I am Bishop of Auckland. The Mayor of Auckland and the chairman
  of the Harbour Board are <i>ex officio</i> members, and seven
  others are elected annually by the subscribers. Mr. Hugh Anderson
  is vice-president, and Colonel Haultain is hon. secretary. By
  our "articles of association," religious teaching is
  always to be allowed in the Home, subject to the regulations
  of the council, and no intoxicating drink or gambling is to be
  allowed on the premises. Our "articles of association"
  were drawn up by Sir F. Whitaker; and our first secretary was
  Mr. C. T. Tilly, formerly of the navy, to whom we are under great
  obligation for his counsel and his ordering of our accounts.
  At the laying of the stone there was a short ceremony, at which
  the Rev. J. S. Hill said a prayer, some hymns were sung, I gave
  a sketch of the history of the institution, and some speeches
  were made. In the evening, I preached at S. Mary's.</p>
<p>[90] April 7, Maundy Thursday.--Was spent by me in official
  letter-writing, and in presiding at meetings of the Standing
  Commission and the Diocesan General Trust Board. In the evening,
  I preached at S. Mary's.</p>
<p>April 8, Good Friday.--I preached and took the service at
  S. Paul's at eleven a.m.; Mr. Nelson being absent, at S. Mary's,
  officiating for Mr. Walpole, who was in bed, seriously ill from
  the effects of the poisoning on April 2nd. In the evening, I
  preached at S. Mary's; Archdeacon Clarke saying prayers.</p>
<p>April 9, Saturday.--The day was spent in preparing my Easter
  sermon, and in visiting sick people. Of these one was Major Green,
  formerly of one of H.M.'s regiments, and latterly Sheriff of
  Auckland. I found him very weak in body, but calm in mind. He
  spoke with much feeling of the helpful ministrations of the Rev.
  W. Beatty, Warden of St. John's College, formerly in charge of
  the S. Barnabas' district, and of the Rev. T. H. Sprott, Mr.
  Beatty's successor at S. Barnabas'.</p>
<p>April 10, Easter Day.--Preached at S. Sepulchre's at eleven
  a.m., to a large congregation, and was celebrant. The church
  was very tastefully decorated, and the singing was hearty and
  joyous. The number of communicants at the three celebrations
  was 231. In the afternoon, I gave an address at S. Mark's, at
  a children's service.</p>
<p>April 12, Tuesday.--At 3.30 p.m., I presided at a meeting
  of the governors of St. John's College. The governors are seven
  in number, of whom the Bishop of Auckland is <i>ex officio</i>
  chairman. Of the others, one is appointed by each of the other
  Bishops of New Zealand, and one by the Bishop of Melanesia. The
  present [90/91] governors are the Ven. Robert Maunsell, Archdeacon
  Clarke, the Hon. Colonel Haultain, Mr. McMillan, Mr. Pierce,
  and Mr. H. G. Seth Smith. Colonel Haultain was for many years
  honorary secretary to the trustees of the college, saving the
  estate much expense, and keeping the accounts in a manner worthy
  of admiration for clearness and accuracy. As a member of our
  General and Diocesan Synods, of the Standing Commission, of the
  Standing Committee, and in many other offices, all unpaid, the
  colonel has done for the Church of New Zealand, and in particular
  for this diocese, long, varied, and faithful service, such as
  it is the privilege of few to be able to render.</p>
<p>Of all the other governors mention has already been made,
  except Mr. McMillan, a partner in the firm of Messrs. W. McArthur
  and Co. Mr. McMillan is a member of our Diocesan Synod, in which
  his speeches are always characterised by good sense, large-heartedness,
  and kindliness of feeling. The college was founded by Bishop
  Selvvyn; through whom valuable endowments were given to the institution,
  including an estate of about twelve hundred acres at Tamaki.
  This land will, in course of time, yield a large revenue, as
  it is rich in beautiful sites for suburban residences. The income
  of the college at present is about £1300. The endowments
  are held by five trustees, appointed by the Diocesan Trusts Board
  (the Standing Committee). After defraying working expenses, the
  trustees pay the net income of the estate to the governors, for
  the maintenance of the college. The Warden receives a stipend
  of £400 a year, with quarters in the (temporary) college
  buildings; and £45 a year for the board of each student
  on the [91/92] foundation. All this week was taken up with official
  correspondence and meetings; many visitors on business coming
  daily, to breakfast and dinner, and at other times.</p>
<p>April 17, Sunday.--Acted as Mr. Walpole's <i>locum tenens</i>
  at S. Mary's, he being still in bed, from the effects of the
  poisoning on April 2nd.</p>
<p>April 21, Thursday.--The Girls' Friendly Society, of which
  E. is president, held their anniversary to-day. At six p.m.,
  there was a short service at S. Matthew s, when I addressed the
  congregation--about two hundred and fifty associates and members.
  Afterwards there was a high tea in the parish schoolroom, followed
  by a social evening. The Rev. A. G. Purchas, who is always ready
  to help to entertain young people, exhibited his microscope;
  and other scientific instruments were shown and explained. Our
  diocesan branch of this excellent society was established in
  1883, by Lady Jervois, during her first sojourn at Government
  House, Auckland. The chief object of the society is to maintain
  among young women a high standard of purity. It is the duty of
  the associates to act a motherly or sisterly part towards their
  members, residents in the same parish or district; the whole
  organisation being under the direction of the clergyman of the
  same. The affairs of the society are managed by a council elected
  annually. Of the present council, some have been among E.'s coadjutors
  in benevolent works almost ever since our arrival in Auckland,
  notably Mrs. Nelson, Mrs. Hey-wood, Mrs. Boardman, Miss Hunter,
  and the Misses Vickers.</p>
<p>April 22, Friday.--I attended a meeting of our Lay [92/93]
  Readers' Association, the object of which is to help the lay
  readers of the diocese in their important work. At present there
  are about forty-five laymen holding my licence for the discharge
  of this office. Their chief duty is to conduct public worship
  in country churches, where there is no resident clergyman. When
  it is proposed that a reader should be licensed, a memorial--declaring
  the confidence of the memorialists in his "morals, integrity,
  and devoutness"--is signed by representatives of our people
  resident in the district concerned, and is sent to me. After
  satisfying myself that it is right to comply with the petition
  of the memorial, I issue the licence, and, when possible, present
  it myself to the recipient on a Sunday, after the Second Lesson.
  Before receiving the licence, the reader signs a declaration
  of his being a member of the Church, and of his willingness to
  submit to authority, and to conform to the customs of the Church.
  ["Readers" are <i>ordained </i>in the Greek Church,
  in which they constitute a fifth order. At their ordination,
  the Bishop says to each, among other things, "Son, ... it
  is your duty daily to study the Holy Scriptures, and to endeavour
  to make such proficiency therein that those who hear you may
  receive edification."--H. Lansdell, D. D.] Our association
  hopes to bring the readers together periodically, for mutual
  counsel and encouragement; to establish a library of books specially
  useful to the readers; and to encourage qualified laymen, living
  in our towns, to go to the country occasionally for a Sunday,
  to help the clergy on that day. Besides those formally licensed,
  there are other readers, not yet licensed, doing excellent work
  in connection with our Sunday schools and other departments of
  the Church's work.</p>
<p>In the evening of this day, the annual meeting of [93/94]
  our Orphan Home was held, in a room at the Young Men's Christian
  Association. I presided, and made a short speech in proposing
  the first resolution. This excellent institution was founded
  in 1860, its originator having been the late Archdeacon Lloyd,
  formerly Incumbent of S. Paul's, Auckland. The Home is said to
  have originated as follows:--Mr. Lloyd was visiting a poor woman
  of his parish on her death-bed, and she was so disturbed in mind
  about the future of her children whom she was about to leave,
  that she could with difficulty listen to what he had to say.
  To comfort her, Mr. Lloyd told her not to distress herself about
  her children, as he would see that they were taken care of and
  properly educated. They were the first children of the Home.
  This is a good exemplification of the adage, <i>Principia omnium
  sunt parva</i>, and may be compared to the origin of our Sailors'
  Home. The present state of these institutions, and of our Women's
  Home, may encourage others not to despise the day of small things,
  in works of benevolence. From the first, however, its chief friend
  has been Mr. G. P. Pierce, who has for many years held the office
  of honorary secretary. The Home is situated on the S. Stephen's
  estate in Parnell, near Bishopscourt, and until 1883 was maintained
  almost entirely by voluntary subscriptions. In that year, it
  received a bequest of £12,150 from the late Mr. Costley,
  through the kind thoughtfulness of Mr. S. Jackson. At present
  there are fifty boys in the Home, and twenty girls; and there
  would be more if the buildings were large enough to receive them.
  At the annual meeting, about thirty of the children were present,
  looking the [94/95] picture of health and contentment. They were
  accompanied by their excellent matron, Mrs. Neary, and their
  efficient head teacher, Mrs. Scarlett.</p>
<p>April 23, Saturday.--A day occupied by interviews with visitors
  and official writing. In the latter work I was helped, as I often
  am, by Miss Emily Purchas, whose writing the printer finds no
  difficulty in reading. Her visits to Bishopscourt are always
  welcome, independently of the efficient manner in which she discharges
  the office of scribe; our children, like ourselves, holding her
  in esteem and affection.</p>
<p>April 24, Sunday.--Preached at All Saints' in the morning,
  and S. Sepulchres in the evening, on "Family Religion,"
  at the request of a "ministers' meeting" held in Auckland.
  At the former church I took the whole service, in the absence
  of the incumbent, the Rev. W. Calder, who was away from home
  in consequence of an attack of laryngitis. Mr. Calder came to
  Auckland in 1874 from Honolulu, where he was made a deacon by
  Bishop Willis. His first charge was at Hamilton, in the Waikato,
  whence he removed to the Thames in 1881. In both those cures
  he worked with his accustomed energy, being zealously seconded
  by Mrs. Calder. Both husband and wife literally gave themselves
  and all that they had for the advancement of the mission of the
  Church. On account of their proved fitness, in zeal, ability,
  and Christian character, the Board of Nominators selected Mr.
  Calder for the incumbency of All Saints', when that charge became
  vacant in 1883. I had before appointed him one of my chaplains,
  in acknowledgment of his faithfulness to his responsibilities.
  My chief anxiety for both of them is lest they should exert [95/96]
  themselves beyond the bounds of prudence, and become prematurely
  unequal to the cares of a large parish. I have scarcely ever
  had to hint to one of our clergy, or to a clergyman's wife, that
  he or she might work a little harder, but I have often had to
  remind clergymen and their wives of the Greek maxim, <font face="Symbol">MHDEN
  AGAN</font>--"<i>nothing </i>in excess." One of our
  clergy, acquainted with boat-racing language, said to me on one
  occasion, when I was pointing out the unsatisfactory result of
  overwork on the part of his excellent wife, "Yes; she puts
  on a spurt for a week, and then lies in the bottom of the boat
  for the rest of the month."</p>
<p>When a country clergyman tells me of his taking four services
  and riding fifteen or twenty miles on a Sunday, I remind him
  of Canrobert's words at Balaclava: "C'est magnifique; mais
  ce n'est pas la guerre."</p>
<p>In the afternoon of this day I baptized Dorothea Elizabeth
  Walpole, my god-daughter, the second child of the Rev. G. H.
  S. Walpole, of S. Mary's; the godmothers being Mrs. Sewell and
  Miss D. V. Barham.</p>
<p>April 25, Monday.--I left Auckland by the S.S. <i>Clansman
  </i>(600 tons) for Russell in the Bay of Islands, accompanied
  by E. and our youngest boy, Arthur Preston. The wind had been
  blowing from the east for several days, and we had in consequence
  to roll through a heavy beam sea, which made the passage very
  trying. The Clansman is a good sea-boat, and the skipper, Mr.
  William Farquhar, a skilful seaman and thoroughly acquainted
  with the coast, up and down which he has gone almost every week
  for seventeen years. The passage occupied nearly twelve hours,
  the distance being 128 miles. Archdeacon Clarke, the Rev, Hone
  Papahia, [96/97] and Miss Maning went with us. E. and I took
  our horses for our long journey.</p>
<p>April 26, Tuesday.--We crossed to Paihia in a small steam
  launch, the Ida. On landing, we heard that a funeral party of
  Maories were assembled on the beach, about two miles off, about
  to cross the water to Russell with the coffin containing the
  body of Lucy te Tai. I had intended to visit the mourners before
  they crossed the water to the Russell cemetery, but I had not
  an opportunity of doing so, as they embarked before I left Paihia.
  We saw five boats, one in advance of the others, crossing the
  bay. Before the mourners left, Archdeacon Clarke went to see
  them. He was kindly received, with the usual Maori welcome, and
  was told that the only <i>utu</i> (revenge) they wished was that
  he should "come and live among them again." We may
  well be proud of our Maories showing a spirit so essentially
  Christian. In the afternoon, we rode to Waimate, about fifteen
  miles, where we became the guests of Mr. H. T. Clarke, the archdeacon's
  brother. My first visit to Waimate was in 1870. At that time,
  and until 1885, Archdeacon Clarke lived there. The old church,
  an unsightly building, and somewhat ruinous, was then standing.
  In 1872, the new church was consecrated by me. A large part of
  the building fund was obtained through Mrs. Clarke and her mother,
  Mrs. Wood, both of whom devoted themselves to the interests of
  the Maories of the Northern Archdeaconry for many years. The
  Maori clergy especially derived much benefit from Mrs. Clarke's
  kindness, which showed itself, as in other ways, so also by her
  treating them with respect in her own house, and at her [97/98]
  own table. At seven p.m., I held a Confirmation, and celebrated
  the Lord's Supper at S. Johns, of which the Rev. P. Walsh, one
  of my chaplains, is the clergyman. As we had to leave Waimate
  on the following morning, we hoped to see some of the people
  outside the church after the service, but when we came out we
  found that they had all fled, the night being dark and the rain
  near at hand. Waimate was the first New Zealand home of Bishop
  Selwyn, in 1842; and his second son, the present Bishop of Melanesia,
  was born there in 1844. It was then the head-quarters of the
  Church Missionary Society in New Zealand. S.Johns is used by
  the Maories of the neighbourhood as well as by the settlers,
  the latter being for the most part the sons and descendants of
  catechists and other officials of that society. The Rev. Philip
  Walsh is one of the best amateur draughtsmen I ever knew, and
  is an accomplished architect. He came to New Zealand, with other
  sons of Irish clergymen, to form a special settlement, at Whangai
  in this district. There I made his acquaintance in 1871. In 1872,
  he and a fellow-settler, Mr. W. N. de L. Willis, were appointed
  to foundation scholarships at S. John's College. Mr. Walsh's
  first charge was at Waitara. Since 1882 he has held several appointments,
  being always ready to go wherever he can be of most use, treating
  stipend as a matter of comparatively little importance.</p>
<p>April 27, Wednesday.--A threatening morning, with heavy rain
  squalls from the south-west. At ten a.m. we set out for Kaeo,
  about twenty-five miles distant, our party consisting of E.,
  myself, and our son Arthur, Archdeacon Clarke, Miss Maning, the
  Rev. P. Walsh [98/99] the Rev. H. P. Taua (Maori minister of
  Waimate), and two Maori attendants, carrying our bags. [We paid
  the Maories 7 <i>s</i>. a day each, besides providing board and
  lodging--at hotels when necessary.] In the afternoon, heavy rain
  fell, making the track very muddy and slippery, especially in
  the forest, which we got through just before darkness set in.
  The last few miles, in darkness, down the steep, broken, muddy
  track, through tall scrub, in drizzling rain, was most unpleasant.
  [<font face="Symbol">nukta keimerinon udati kai anemw, kai ama
  aselhnon</font>] We reached a small inn at Kaeo about 7.30 p.m.,
  thoroughly tired, and rather wet. The two ladies bore the journey
  bravely.</p>
<p>April 28, Thursday.--We left Kaeo for Mangonui, about twenty
  miles, at ten a.m. It was a case of <i>solvitur ambulando</i>,
  for with the threatening weather the prospect was not very encouraging.
  Light rain was falling when we set out. The road was very slippery,
  and much of it through water or mud. We forded two rivers. By
  the time we neared the Taratara hill the drizzle had become a
  steady downpour, accompanied by violent gusts of wind. [<font face="Symbol">ceimwn noteroV</font>] Our route took us over
  a series of high hills covered with low fern and ti-tree scrub,
  affording no shelter from the wind and rain. After three and
  a half hours' ride we dismounted in the rain, to give the horses
  a little rest, and stood under the shelter, such as it was, of
  a clump of low ti-tree, down in a hollow. Here we ate our luncheon,
  consisting of a few biscuits and sandwiches (left over from yesterday's
  supply). E. and Miss Maning bore the fatigue and wetting with
  their accustomed courage, and laughed at all unpleasantness.
  At [99/100] two o'clock, we set out again, the rain now falling
  in sheets, and being driven against us by the wind blowing with
  almost hurricane force, as we ascended the exposed hillsides
  and passed over their crests. [We afterwards learnt that the
  S.S. <i>Clansman </i>remained in shelter at Russell that night,
  and that the S.S. <i>Te Anau</i>, by venturing out to sea, had
  a bad time of it, and took twenty-four hours (instead of ten)
  to reach Auckland.] Now and then some of the horses--notably
  E.'s--would not face the storm for a time, and there was nothing
  to be done but to sit like a statue and be drenched to the skin,
  as E. and Miss Maning were. Some of the Maories, when the gale
  was at its height, managed to get their horses over the crest
  of the hills, and so to be somewhat sheltered from the worst
  of the blasts. The two ladies showed the greatest pluck, not
  uttering a word of anxiety when things were at their worst, but
  smiling encouragement when our horses could with difficulty keep
  their feet, and there was some prospect of our being benighted.
  The rain and wind continued, with varying force, until we reached
  Mangonui, where we arrived just before dark, after one of the
  most trying day's work that any of us had experienced. There
  are two small inns at Mangonui. We divided our party between
  the two; E. and I and Arthur (who had borne the journey manfully)
  going to the Settlers', of which the landlord is Mr. Williams.
  The ladies had to be wrapped in blankets and to go to bed, not
  having any dry clothes to put on. Happily neither of them had
  taken cold. Later in the evening, with the help of good fires,
  they managed to make themselves comfortable. There was a dearth
  of ordinary food at Mangonui. Not [100/101] an egg was to be
  had, and the meat that was offered us was too hard for our teeth
  to penetrate.</p>
<p>April 29.--The gale continued to blow with unabated fury,
  and the rain to fall in torrents all day, keeping us close prisoners
  at the Mangonui inn. If the weather had been fine, we could not
  easily have continued our journey, as it took the whole day to
  dry our clothes.</p>
<p>April30, Saturday.--The rain ceased before nine a.m., and
  at 9.15 we set out on our twenty-five miles' ride to Kaitaia.
  Before eleven we reached the Taipa river, across which our horses
  had to swim, the riders being ferried across by young Mr. Adamson;
  whose father, according to his rule with ministers of religion,
  would not charge our party anything for this service. He also
  gave us some oats for our horses, and Mrs. Adamson thoughtfully
  supplied all our party with some delicious cocoa, hot and sustaining.
  Our route for about twelve miles beyond the Taipa was over high
  hills, bleak, and covered with starved-looking fern. It was not,
  however, an uninteresting ride, as we had the sea on our right
  and high hills on our left, with Maungataniwha (2151 feet [Hochstetter.])
  in the distance. It was a day of bright sunshine and balmy air,
  the wind being in the north-west, and the track, except in low-lying
  places, quite dry. At 4.30, we reached Awanui, a large Maori
  settlement on the banks of a river of that name. Mr. Simpson,
  formerly of the Bengal Engineers, but for many years a settler
  here, met us on the road, and took us, tired and hungry, into
  his comfortable cottage, buried amid luxuriant trees, and Mrs.
  Simpson regaled us with delicious curry, roast beef, and well-made
  tea.</p>
<p>[102] At about six p.m. we set out again for our last stage--to
  Kaitaia. The moon was eight days old, and we therefore had some
  light during the last part of our ride, which was in many places
  through rushing water, our road being through a flat country,
  much flooded after heavy rain.</p>
<p>We reached the Kaitaia Parsonage about 7.30 p.m., and were
  kindly received by the Rev. Joseph Matthews and his wife. Mr.
  Matthews came to Kaitaia first in 1833, as a catechist of the
  Church Missionary Society. He was afterwards ordained by Bishop
  Selwyn. Mrs. Matthews is a daughter of the late Rev. R. Davis,
  also of the Church Missionary Society. Mr. Matthews has done
  invaluable work for the Church during many years, in bringing
  forward young Maories to be prepared for Holy Orders. He has,
  in his retirement at Kaitaia, read with profit much wholesome
  English divinity, and his memory is very retentive. His conversation
  and his letters are always interesting and instructive. He is
  now seventy-eight years of age.</p>
<p>May 1, .S. Philip and S. James's Day, Sunday.--The early morning
  was bright, but as the day advanced the weather became showery,
  making the ground wet and muddy. This was very unfortunate, as
  many Maories had travelled a great distance to be present at
  the consecration of 6". Saviour's Church, which took place
  at 10.30 a.m. The building has been erected from drawings made
  and given by the Rev. Philip Walsh, at a cost of more than £400;
  of which sum about one-half was contributed by the Maories of
  this district and of other parts of the Northern Archdeaconry.
  A grant of £20 was received from the Society for Promoting
  Christian [102/103] Knowledge. There are very few churches in
  the diocese towards the building of which help has not been obtained
  from this excellent society; and without the encouragement afforded
  by this help, some of our churches would not have been built
  when they were, if at all.</p>
<p>The church is very pretty, and the situation is good--close
  to the site of the old church, now in ruins, built in 1840. I
  was met at the church porch by the clergy and others, according
  to the usual order at consecrations, and the memorial was read
  by Archdeacon Clarke. The other clergy present were the Revs.
  G. Aitkens, J. Matthews, and Philip Walsh (Bishop's chaplain);
  and the Revs. R. Kaamiti, M. Kapa, W. te Paa (Bishop's chaplain),
  J. Taitimu, and H. P. te Taua. As we entered the building, a
  Maori version of "The Church's one foundation" was
  sung, the Archdeacon leading in a loud, clear voice. I said the
  usual consecration prayers in Maori, and E. led the <i>Venite</i>,
  which was not, however, well taken up by the congregation, who
  had not been taught to chant the canticles. Each of the Maori
  clergy took part in the service. At the celebration I was assisted
  by the Archdeacon and the Revs. W. te Paa and H. P. te Taua.
  There were nearly 150 communicants. Before Holy Communion 117
  Maories were confirmed, some of them having travelled sixty-five
  miles to receive this helpful rite. After the service, clergy
  and people walked round the cemetery, an acre next to the church
  site, repeating selected psalms, according to our custom at the
  consecration of burial-grounds. A good many of the Maories kept
  at a distance from the procession, having superstitious fears
  [103/104] connected with the graves of the old chiefs. The rain
  began to fall as soon as we had completed our circum-ambulation,
  so that my address had to be very brief. The Maories are very
  fond of a function; and, as I was afterwards informed, they much
  appreciated the orderly procession of clergy, entering the church
  and afterwards walking round the cemetery. There was not room
  in the building for nearly all the congregation, but those who
  were obliged to remain outside joined reverently in the service,
  and through the doors and open windows could hear what was said.
  I took for my text, "In My Father's house are many mansions."
  The offertory collection for the building fund amounted to £10
  12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. In the afternoon, at three, service was
  held in English. Prayers were said by the Rev. G. Aitkens; the
  Lessons being read by the archdeacon and the Rev. P. Walsh, who
  also read the Preface to the Confirmation service, which followed.
  My text was, "I am the way, the truth, and the life,"
  from the Gospel for the Saints' Day, like that of the morning.
  At four p.m., there was a second service in Maori. The prayers
  were said by the Rev. R. Kaamiti, the Lessons being read by the
  Rev. M. te Hara; and the archdeacon preached. Among other old
  acquaintances whom I met to-day was W. F. T------, formerly of
  H.M.'s 78th Highlanders. Soon after my arrival in the colony,
  in 1870, I met him casually on the road in the Howick district.
  I was riding with one of our clergy, when we met a sturdy-looking
  settler on foot, who in passing accompanied his bow with a smile
  of recognition. I said to my companion, "That man seems
  to know me;" and he answered, "Very likely; he is an
  old soldier." Thereupon [104/105] I turned back, and asked
  our friend whether we had ever met before; to which he answered,
  "Oh yes. I was in the 78th, and you were our chaplain."
  That gallant regiment went to the relief of Lucknow with Sir
  H. Havelock in 1857. In the following year, after the fall of
  Lucknow, the 78th Regiment formed part of Sir Colin Campbell's
  force, to which I was chaplain, at the capture of Bareilly. Since
  W. F. T------and I met again near Howick in 1870 we have not
  lost sight of one another.</p>
<p>The rain poured in torrents during the night.</p>
<p>May 2, Monday.--The rain fell almost incessantly all the morning,
  but ceased at two p.m., when we set out for Awanui, about six
  miles distant, on the road to Mangonui. At 4.30, the cemetery
  at Awanui was consecrated, and afterwards the new church, named
  S. Joseph's, partly in gratitude for the good work done by the
  Rev. Joseph Matthews of Kaitaia, and for the ministrations of
  a late lay reader of the settlement, Joseph Poutama. The church
  was crowded. At the celebration I was assisted by the Rev. W.
  te Paa. The collection for the church building fund amounted
  to £26 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. It was a beautiful moonlight
  night. The service ended soon after six p.m., when a banquet
  was provided by the Maories for all comers. E., Miss Maning,
  and I did not stay for it, but were glad to get to our quarters
  for the night under the hospitable roof of Mr. and Mrs. Simpson.
  They are members of the Roman Church, and have a son in Priest's
  Orders. They were married at Simla, in the house of the late
  Sir Henry Havelock, and Mr. Simpson was at the battle of Ferozeshah
  in 1845. Our horses, like ourselves, were [105/106] well off
  at Mrs. Simpson's, where grass was abundant, the Kaitaia paddocks
  having been very bare. At 1.30, we reached the Taipa river. Whilst
  our horses were being swum across it, we were regaled with cups
  of hot and good tea by Mrs. Adamson, at her house near the ferry;
  and at 4.30 p.m. we arrived at our former quarters at the Settlers'
  Hotel. In the evening, I gave a lecture on "The Extension
  of the British Empire" in the Court House, at the inaugural
  meeting of the Chess and Literary Club. The chair was occupied
  at the meeting by Mr. W. H. Bishop, resident magistrate, the
  son of an English clergyman.</p>
<p>May 4, Wednesday.--At ten a.m. I held a Confirmation at S.
  Andrews Church, Mangonui. I found the building much improved
  by the handiwork of the Rev. G. Aitkens, the clergyman of the
  district, who came to us from the diocese of Manitoba in 1886.
  At noon, we left Mangonui, accompanied by Miss Maning, in the
  S.S. <i>Clansman</i>, for Whangaroa, where we arrived at two
  p.m. The entrance to the Whangaroa harbour is very fine, through
  a narrow opening in the coast wall of dark rocks. There are two
  saw-mills in the harbour, employing at present about forty men.
  A strong south-west wind was blowing when we arrived, making
  the sea very rough for small boats; but it had not prevented
  Mr. Aitkens from rowing himself across from Totara, the point
  to which he had ridden (about fifteen miles) to meet me, since
  we parted--three hours before--at Mangonui. His rough Manitoba
  experience has prepared him well for journeys by land and water
  in his less trying New Zealand charge. 61. Paul's Church, Whangaroa,
  stands on high ground above the harbour, [106/107] some hundreds
  of feet below a huge dome-shaped rock known as S. Paul's. The
  land between the rock and the lower boundary of the church site
  (ten acres) was given to the Synod by the late Mr. J. Shepherd,
  once a catechist of the Church Missionary Society; who also bequeathed
  about £70 as the beginning of an endowment for the maintenance
  of a clergyman at Whangaroa. At three o'clock I held a Confirmation
  at S. Paul's. I was to have been here the night before, when
  there would, no doubt, have been a large congregation; but the
  tempestuous weather of the preceding week prevented my getting
  back from Kaitaia before this day, and I was consequently obliged
  to hold the service at an hour when few people could attend.
  We left again by the Clansman at five p.m., and reached Russell
  at eight.</p>
<p>May 5, Thursday.--At Russell, where we paid a short visit
  to our old friend Mrs. Ford, the widow of the late Mr. S. Ford,
  who was for many years the doctor of the Bay of Islands district.
  Mrs. Ford, like her deceased husband, takes a warm interest in
  all Christian work, and to the utmost of her ability helps such
  causes as that of our Diocesan Home Mission and our Women's Home,
  with her purse as well as with her prayers. Her house has for
  years been the resting-place of clergymen going to and fro on
  diocesan duty; and I have often partaken of her hospitality,
  and rested in her "prophet's chamber."</p>
<p>We visited the cemetery, to see the grave of Ihaka te Tai
  and his wife Lucy. It was inexpressibly sad to think of our having
  lost so valuable a man as Ihaka in the way in which we did. The
  doctors say that if Ihaka and the two Maori clergy who also died,
  from partaking [107/108] of the pie containing meat in a state
  of fermentation, had remained in Auckland under medical care,
  they would probably have recovered. As it was, however, they
  seem to have made up their minds that they were going to die,
  and they were eager to reach their homes in time to breathe their
  last amid their own people. Accordingly, they all left Auckland
  by the S.S. Clansman on Monday, April 4, and, after leaving,
  neither of them had the advice and help of a medical man until
  in a moribund state. Russell is now a very small place, and scarcely
  any business is being done there. There were two American whalers
  (from New Bedford) lying off the wharf at the time of our visit.
  In former days, a fleet of these vessels was often in the bay.
  The two skippers, both men of natural refinement, and their wives
  accompanied us to Auckland by the steamer. One of the men was
  suffering from some sort of cancerous growth on his lower lip,
  said to be caused by a tobacco pipe. We heard afterwards that
  the diseased part had been cut out by Dr. Haines. The Russell
  church is one of the oldest in the diocese, having been built
  by the Church Missionary Society in 1838. In one of the sides
  of the building there is still the mark of a round shot, fired
  from H.M.S. <i>Hazard </i>at the battle of Kororareka in March,
  1845. Russell forms part of the Kawakawa charge, but at present
  there is no resident clergyman in the district. The Sunday services
  are conducted by Mr. J. H. Greenway, one of the senior lay readers
  of the diocese, a man to be relied upon for the faithful discharge
  of any responsibility that he undertakes.</p>
<p>At five p.m. we left by the S.S. <i>Clansman </i>for Auckland,
  where we arrived on the following morning at 4.30.</p>
<p>[109] May 8, Sunday.--One of my services to-day was at S.
  Thomas's, Auckland, where I held a Confirmation at eleven o'clock.
  This parish was mainly a part of the old parish of S. Matthew's,
  and was separated from the mother parish in 1882. A Diocesan
  Synod can at any time alter the boundaries of a parish, either
  adding to or taking from the original area. This arrangement
  saves much evil, and cannot easily produce harm, as the Synod
  is not likely to take action in such a matter, excepting on the
  recommendation of those most interested therein. S. Thomas's
  is a difficult parish for a clergyman to work at all satisfactorily,
  by reason of the many ravines by which it is intersected. A large
  proportion of the inhabitants are of the artisan class, and very
  few of the parishioners could be called men "of means."
  The present incumbent of 51. Thomas's is the Rev. W. M. Du Rieu,
  who was for about ten years one of the curates of S. Barnabas',
  Pimlico. He came to Auckland <i>proprio motu </i>in 1884, and
  was before very long instituted to this charge. Mr. Du Rieu has
  the cordial co-operation of several earnest lay helpers, by whose
  assistance he has been enabled to keep up the large and efficient
  choir of men and boys, who were first incorporated by his predecessor,
  the Rev. Lloyd Keating. The usual means of keeping up the working
  staff of a town parish are carefully cherished by Mr. Du Rieu,
  and there is good reason to hope that his ministrations are producing
  encouraging results among his people generally.</p>
<p>At eight a.m. I was celebrant at S. Mary's; and at 6.30 p.m.
  I helped at S. Mary's, where the Rev. J. S. Hill preached. Mr.
  Hill came to New Zealand in 1879 in connection with the Church
  Missionary Society, and [109/110] was for some time stationed
  at Wairoa, in the diocese of Waiapu. Not finding work amongst
  the Maories that for which he was specially fitted, especially
  as he did not make much progress in acquiring a knowledge of
  their language, he ceased his connection with the Church Missionary
  Society. He came to live in Auckland in 1883, and has since then
  done excellent work in the diocese, and in Auckland in particular,
  as a missioner. A stipend is provided for him by a few zealous
  citizens, not all members of the Church of England. He holds
  my licence as chaplain to our people confined in the central
  gaol. Mr. Hill is at present president of the Young Men's Christian
  Association, where he exercises an extensive influence for good
  among a large section of the community.</p>
<p>This week was taken up as usual by meetings, correspondence,
  and interviews with many visitors.</p>
<p>May 15, Sunday.--I was Mr. Walpole's <i>locum tenens</i> at
  S. Marys, during his absence in the south, in quest of health,
  after his long confinement to the house.</p>
<p>In the evening, the Rev. W. Beatty, Warden of S. John's College,
  preached. His sermon was on the Epistle for the day--from S.
  James, chapter i. After explaining the sense in which the words
  religion and religions are used in this chapter, he pointed out,
  in a plain and striking manner, how a care for religion, in the
  ordinary acceptation of the words, was compatible with very un-Christian
  conduct; instancing, amongst others, the case of John Calvin,
  whose "religion" did not prevent him from burning Servetus.
  After the service, I told him of a striking instance, in my own
  experience, of the severance of religion and morality in the
  minds and [110/111] practice of millions. It was as follows:--I
  was on my way, in November, 1863, to join Sir Neville Chamberlain's
  column in the hills beyond Peshawur, which was engaged in a small
  war with some of the Afghan tribes. I was travelling in a primitive,
  one-horsed conveyance, called an <i>ekka</i>, driven by a Mahomedan,
  whom I questioned about the people opposed to our troops. In
  answer to one of my queries, the man said of the tribesmen, "Their
  religion is excellent, but they are great scoundrels (<i>burrha
  budmarsh hyn</i>)."</p>
<p>May 16, Monday.--We vacated Bishopscourt, and went to Howick,
  a small settlement on the Hauraki Gulf, about twelve miles from
  Auckland; where we occupied the parsonage house, in the absence
  of the clergyman, who had gone away for a month's change. Howick
  is one of the old pensioner settlements, established on the outskirts
  of Auckland in days when the Maories were numerous and the settlers
  few, and it was thought necessary to take precautions against
  raids on the city by the native population. The old pensioners
  are now fast dying out, and as the land in the neighourhood of
  the settlement is for the most part poor, not many new people
  have come to the district. The church and parsonage are beautifully
  situated on high ground overlooking the sea, which is almost
  shut in by islands some miles distant. As there is no railway
  station within eight or nine miles of Howick, we find that we
  can enjoy a little retirement here, without neglecting our ordinary
  duties; as there is a daily post to and from Auckland, and by
  means of the telephone in the village (not half a mile distant)
  we can speak to our servants at Bishopscourt, and to nearly five
  hundred people in [111/112] Auckland, who are on the Exchange.
  With the help of one servant, brought with us, E. and the children
  accomplish all the domestic work of the house, including the
  care of our horses. Though it is now winter time, it is not too
  cold for us to bathe in the sea, which is not half a mile from
  the house, and has good beaches.</p>
<p>May 19, Ascension Day.--Celebration of Holy Communion at All
  Saints', Howick. The church is situated in a corner of the district,
  far away from most of the people, and I could not therefore expect
  a larger congregation than there was, especially as notice of
  the service had not been given on the previous Sunday. There
  were fifteen communicants, including our old friends, Mr. and
  Mrs. C. James Wilson, whom I met first at Stafford in 1867, when
  I had no idea of coming to New Zealand. Mr. Wilson is our lay
  reader here, and gives the clergyman much help in many ways;
  and Mrs. Wilson is the kind friend of all who are in trouble
  of mind, body, or estate in the settlement, and is a principal
  teacher in the Sunday school. Her motto might well be, <i>Christo
  in pauperibus</i>.</p>
<p>May 20.--E. and I have been engaged this morning in cleaning
  out a large water tank made of corrugated zinc. As the house
  had not been regularly inhabited for some time the gutters below
  the roof had got choked with leaves, preventing the water from
  entering the tank, and we found that the tank contained more
  than one inch of black mud, consisting chiefly of decomposed
  leaves. Accordingly, we took down the tank and cleaned it out,
  and set it up again, hoping that rain would fall during the night
  to fill it. A country clergyman and his wife in New Zealand need
  to be able to [112/113] turn their hands to all kinds of work,
  as there are not, as a rule, resident plumbers or carpenters
  in thinly populated districts, even if the clerical stipend could
  pay them.</p>
<p>May 22, Sunday.--I took the morning service at All Saints',
  Howick, Mr. C. James Wilson reading the Lessons. The congregation
  numbered seventy-five, a fairly good attendance, considering
  the out-of-the-way site of the church and the large proportion
  of Roman Catholics in the settlement--the families of the pensioned
  Irish soldiers who were given land here in early days. This proportion
  may be inferred from the fact that at the Board School of the
  settlement there is an average attendance of eighty childen,
  of whom one-half belong to that body. It is a mistake to suppose
  that in this colony, where there is no <i>established </i>Church,
  a more fraternal spirit is exhibited by the Roman section of
  Christendom towards other Christians than in countries where
  the Pope's subjects are in a majority. Whilst our personal relations
  with Romanists--whether bishops, priests, or laymen--are friendly,
  there is no more co-operation between New Zealand Roman Catholics
  as a body and other Christian bodies in this country, than there
  is in France or Spain. I have, however, on several occasions
  experienced quite as much lack of sympathy from members of other
  denominations as from Roman Catholics. For this state of things
  the clergy and other ministers of religion are, I believe, mainly
  responsible; their zeal for the distinguishing features of their
  several sections of Christendom being, it would seem, accentuated
  by the fact that lay Christians generally throughout the colony
  have a tendency to fraternise. The foregoing [113/114] opinion
  may be illustrated by the following facts:--When we were sojourning
  in a country district not long ago, the Roman priest of those
  regions called and left his card, "with kind wishes, and
  welcome to------." The same priest, some time before, when
  preaching in the Auckland gaol, said to his congregation, as
  the governor of the gaol (who was present) afterwards told me,
  "You have been found guilty of attempts to murder, to steal,
  and of all kinds of wickedness--you might as well be Protestants
  at once." The following incident illustrates the brotherliness
  of a minister of the denomination which the late Bishop Cotton
  (of Calcutta) used to speak of as "the most un-Catholic
  of sects":--A few years ago a new Roman Catholic bishop
  came to Auckland; and it was arranged by his people that he should
  be met by deputations of them on the wharf, on the arrival of
  the steamer from Australia. Accordingly, two of E.'s servants,
  the cook and the housemaid, Irish Roman Catholic girls, went
  with others to meet the steamer, taking with them a small bouquet
  of geraniums and roses which we gave them. By the mistake of
  some person of lively imagination, the Auckland papers, in describing
  the reception of the new Bishop, spoke of the bouquet as "an
  offering from Bishop Cowie," looking upon the two Roman
  Catholic girls as messengers from me. Several letters from "indignant
  Protestants" appeared in the papers, finding grave fault
  with me, especially as the humble bouquet came at last to be
  described as "a floral cross"! The expected climax
  arrived. The minister of "the most un-Catholic of sects"
  improved the occasion, I was told, by holding up to the scorn
  of his hearers "the unholy alliance," as he called
  it, of the [114/115] two Bishops. On being informed of the groundlessness
  of his charge, he did not think it necessary, we were told, to
  retract what he had said. Some of those who had said the bitterest
  things in connection with "the floral cross," on discovering
  their mistake, and wishing to "justify themselves"
  and retire gracefully from their uncomfortable championship,
  demanded "an explanation from Bishop Cowie," who, as
  they knew, had nothing to explain. Of course, I took no notice
  of the bigotry and bitterness of my denouncers; and my silence
  on this, as on other occasions of a like nature, irritated the
  wrongdoers into divers exemplifications of the old adage--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Forgiveness to the injured doth belong:<br/>
    They ne'er forgive who've done the wrong."</p></blockquote>
<p>In this free country, however, we claim the right of complying
  with the request of any fellow-citizen, to whatever denomination
  he may belong, who may apply to us for flowers or fruit from
  our garden; and there are, we would fain hope, few of our fellow-citizens
  who would wish to deny us this right.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, E. and Katherine rode with me to S. Paul's,
  Flat Bush (about five miles), where I took the service at three
  o'clock. The church was opened in January, 1886, and stands on
  a corner of an estate (about 290 acres) given in 1869 by the
  Church Missionary Society to the Auckland Bishopric Endowment,
  in lieu of any further contribution to the Bishop's income. Bishop
  Selwyn received £600 a year from the Society, until, at
  his own suggestion, £200 a year of that sum was deducted,
  to augment the stipend of the Bishop of Waiapu. Besides the Flat
  Bush congregation, there are three others, namely, at Pakuranga,
  Brookby, and [115/116] Turanga Creek, included in the Howick
  charge. The district extends over about 120 square miles, the
  people being scattered and for the most part poor. The clergyman's
  stipend is made up of contributions from the congregations, supplemented
  by a grant of £35 from the Home Mission Fund of the diocese,
  and amounted last year to only £160. On our return to the.
  parsonage, about six p.m., our horses were groomed and fed by
  our son Edmund, now at home from Christchurch for the holidays.</p>
<p>In the evening, I would have gone to Pakuranga (three miles),
  where our Sunday services are held in the public hall of the
  settlement, but that Mr. C. James Wilson, the lay reader of the
  district, offered to go for me, and I was glad to be able to
  remain indoors, the night being dark and the road rough.</p>
<p>On this Sunday, the Earl and Countess of Aberdeen were in
  Auckland, and gave excellent addresses to men and women respectively
  at the Young Men's Christian Association. We were very sorry
  not to be at Bishopscourt, so as to be able to offer them some
  hospitality.</p>
<p>Address-givers on religious subjects are now numerous among
  visitors to the colony; but unfortunately they are often proselytisers,
  or at least disintegrators, fomenting the divisions of Christians,
  and adding to their number, and encouraging a self-righteous
  and censorious spirit among the less instructed of our people.</p>
<p>May 26, Thursday.--E. and I returned to Auckland, after three
  days of comparative rest at Howick, where I got through a good
  deal of writing, in the absence of callers and of meetings to
  be attended.</p>
<p>May 27, Friday,--In the morning, I prepared matter [116/117]
  for our diocesan <i>Church Gazette</i>, being assisted by our
  friend, Miss Emily Purchas, who often acts as scribe for me.
  Our <i>Gazette </i>was instituted by me in 1872, and is published
  monthly, containing an official record of diocesan intelligence.
  Its circulation at present is about 800 copies. For the first
  two years of its publication the Gazette cost me a considerable
  sum of money, as well as much time; but since the financial arrangements
  connected with it have been managed by a committee appointed
  by the Synod--Messrs. Cochrane and Upton--the profits (chiefly
  from advertisements) have been large. From these profits, sums
  have at different times been voted by the Synod to divers purposes,
  e.g. £100 in 1883 for the improvement of Bishopscourt,
  and in 1886 £50 to the funds of the Women's Home, Parnell.
  E. and I send between forty and fifty copies of the <i>Gazette
  </i>each month to friends in England and other parts of the world.
  By this means are saved the trouble of answering many letters
  asking for information, and we endeavour to interest people far
  away in the progress of the Church's work in the diocese.</p>
<p>In the evening of this day, the Bishop of Wellington, with
  his wife and daughter, arrived from Te Aroha, where they had
  been staying for nearly a month. The Bishop had been taking baths
  at the famous hot springs (of <i>sodium </i>chiefly), for the
  removal of the effects of a serious fall. He had derived great
  benefit from the water.</p>
<p>Among other matters on which Bishop Hadfield spoke to me was
  the system of taxation at present followed in New Zealand. In
  reference to the income tax, of which I am an advocate, he said
  that it was not [117/118] right to tax the income of a man who
  maintained himself by brain work--as a lawyer or doctor--and
  so expended his capital, at the same rate that a man is taxed
  whose income consists of interest or rent, and whose capital
  is not affected by his daily toil. He thought also that all should
  be taxed for the necessaries of life, and that those who are
  better off should be further taxed by having to pay specially
  for land or other property. In speaking of the constitution of
  our Diocesan Synods, the Bishop agreed with me that mere visitors
  ought not to be invited to take seats in them with power to vote,
  as our General Synod statute at present seems to allow. [See
  G. S. Report for 1886, Canon II., Title B, clause 1, proviso,
  p. 51.]</p>
<p>May 28.--I went to Hamilton, where I was the guest of our
  old friend Mrs. Gwynne. I stayed in the same house in which I
  was hospitised in 1872 by its then occupant, Colonel Lyon, formerly
  of the Coldstream Guards and of the 92nd Highlanders. The climate
  of this part of the Waikato is very bracing at this season. On
  the mornings of the 29th and 30th, there was ice nearly a quarter
  of an inch thick on a pan on Mrs. Gwynne's lawn, and during the
  day the sun was bright and warm, and the air clear. In the same
  train with me to-day there were Mr. Thomas Russell and his son,
  and Mr. Thomas Morrin, both of whom have done much to develop
  the natural resources of the Auckland province. For some years
  Mr. Russell has lived in England, whence he comes to Auckland
  from time to time, passing through the country in harlequin fashion,
  originating new schemes of commercial adventure.</p>
<p>[119] May 29, Whit-Sunday.--In the morning and evening I preached
  at S. Peter's, Hamilton, and in the afternoon at S. Stephen's,
  Tamahere; the prayers on each occasion being said by the Rev.
  R. O'C. Biggs, of Hamilton. At the evening service twenty persons
  were confirmed. On both occasions at S. Peter's there was a good
  congregation, that in the evening overflowing into the vestry
  and the porch. The choir at this church is particularly good,
  being under the direction of Mr. F. Templer, of the Bank of New
  Zealand, who is enthusiastic in the discharge of his duty; Mrs.
  Templer also being one of the most efficient members of the choir.
  The music and singing are not only good but reverent, and the
  services generally are devotional and edifying. Miss Newall,
  Mrs. Gwynne's daughter, is the organist. Mr. Biggs inherited
  this state of things from his predecessor, the Rev. W. Calder,
  and has not allowed it to deteriorate. He is aided by a staff
  of earnest laymen, with whom he works in cordial harmony. In
  the end of 1886, Hamilton had the benefit of a Mission, conducted
  by the Rev. G. E. Mason, Rector of Whitwell, Derbyshire, who,
  with the Rev. C. Bodington, of Christchurch, Lichfield, came
  to New Zealand in August of that year, at the invitation of the
  Primate and myself, to hold Missions among our people. In no
  part of this diocese were their ministrations more highly appreciated
  than in the Waikato; and at Hamilton, among other definite and
  practical results of the Mission, was the abolition of seat-rents.
  In reference to this commendable change, Mr. Marshall, in his
  sermon on May 30, in reminding the S. Peter's congregation that
  they had cut off one source of revenue, cautioned them to offer
  according to their means, lest in [119/120] their recent action
  they should become a warning-, and not an example, to other congregations.
  Mr. Biggs was for many years one of Archdeacon Dudley's most
  efficient lay helpers at S. Sepulchre's, Auckland, and was admitted
  to Deacon's Orders by me in 1877. He was at that time engaged
  in the office of one of our principal Auckland merchants; and
  it was arranged that he was to keep to his secular employment
  whilst in Deacon's Orders, devoting his Sundays to the work of
  a clergyman. In 1882, he was ordained a priest, and was soon
  afterwards appointed to the charge of a country district. May
  30, Monday.--vS. Peter's Church, Hamilton, was consecrated by
  me. The church was built in the time of the Rev. F. C. Lloyd,
  but it is only quite recently that it has become free of debt.
  Hence the delay of this interesting service. The original church
  site (an acre) was purchased in 1867 for £28. In 1875,
  that site was sold for £350; and with this sum, augmented
  by subscriptions, the present church was built, on a site granted
  by the New Zealand Government, in 1875. The day was brilliant,
  and excellent arrangements had been made for the ceremony, much
  of the details having been left to the direction of Mr. Swarbrick,
  a settler of the neighbourhood, who did his part admirably. There
  was a large congregation, including several lay readers and other
  Church officers from distant settlements, who had come to show
  their sympathy with their Hamilton friends. I was met at the
  church porch by Archdeacon Willis and the Revs. R. O'C. Biggs,
  R. G. Boler, and J. Marshall, and Mr. S. T. Seddon, acting Chancellor,
  Mr. Templer, acting Registrar, and others. The usual order for
  consecration was followed. Morning Prayer [120/121] was said
  by Mr. Biggs, and Mr. Marshall preached the sermon--a plain,
  practical, and instructive discourse. There was a large number
  of communicants, and the offertory collection amounted to £10.
  Mr. Boler officiated as Bishop's chaplain. After the service
  there was a luncheon party at the hotel. Other visitors with
  myself were the guests. It was agreed that there should be no
  toasting, but those who wished for a glass of beer could obtain
  it. The large dining-room was quite filled, the tables being
  arranged in horseshoe fashion. I had to leave, to return to Auckland,
  before the entertainment ended. Among my fellow-travellers in
  the train was Mr. James Stewart, the engineer of the line now
  being constructed between Oxford and Rotorua. He told me that
  many Maories were employed by him on that work, making cuttings
  and embankments; and that they fulfilled their contracts faithfully,
  some of them earning as much as nine shillings a day with the
  pick and shovel. The Maori contractor employed in some places
  more men than were necessary; indeed, the Native labourers got
  in one another's way. On pointing this out to the contractor,
  Mr. Stewart was answered by his Maori friend that the contract
  was for the maintenance of the whole tribe, and that therefore
  every member of it who could work had to be employed, to earn
  a share of the money paid by the Government.</p>
<p>May 31.--Bishop Hadfield, with his wife and daughter, left
  us to-day on their return to Wellington.</p>
<p>June 1, Wednesday.--We began our writing this morning before
  five o'clock. Though it is now nearly mid-winter with us, the
  weather is almost perfect; the days being bright, warm, and still,
  and the nights cold [121/122] enough to be bracing. E. and I
  went back to Howick, where our three youngest children had been
  left by us, in the parsonage, with a trusted servant, since May
  25.</p>
<p>June 2, 3, and 4.--At Howick; where I spent these days in
  reading and writing, teaching our children, and bathing in the
  sea. One afternoon we rode to Turanga Creek, to see some ostriches
  that had been recently brought there from the Kaipara district--forty-three
  in number. The birds looked very miserable and feather-less.
  They came originally from South Africa.</p>
<p>June 5, Trinity Sunday.--I took the service at Howick in the
  morning, and at Pakuranga in the evening. At the latter place,
  our people have only the use of the Hall of the settlement for
  public worship; but as a church site has been purchased, we are
  hoping to have a building of our own erected thereon before long.</p>
<p>June 12, Sunday.--After morning service at Howick, E. and
  I rode to Flat Bush, S. Paul's, where I consecrated the little
  cemetery surrounding the church. Our Church cemeteries in New
  Zealand have generally been given to the Synod by individuals,
  or purchased by congregations. In all cases they are held by
  trustees appointed by the Synod; by which body regulations are
  made for their management. Accordingly, there is no question
  as to their ownership, and no heart-burning occasioned by the
  exclusive rights of Churchmen to bury therein. Not that non-conforming
  Christians are always refused the privilege of burying their
  dead in our cemeteries. On the contrary, permission is often
  granted by the trustees to other Christian people to bury the
  bodies of their friends in our cemeteries, in districts in which
  they have no burial-grounds of their [122/123] own. The fraternal
  spirit, the encouraging of which is ever a paramount duty with
  all, is hereby cherished.</p>
<p>June 13.--We returned to Bishopscourt. In the evening the
  Shakespeare Club, of which I am President, met here. The club
  meets twice a month during the winter, beginning with May, in
  the houses of those members who possess rooms large enough for
  the purpose. We usually read from eight p.m. to ten, with a short
  interval for coffee and biscuits. Our rule is to read only half
  a play at a meeting, to avoid weariness. The plays to be read
  are selected by a sub-committee, who also decide by whom the
  several characters shall be taken. The club is a means of improving
  our acquaintance with some of our neighbours and other people.
  Only readers are eligible as members, who are proposed and seconded
  at one meeting and elected at another. Our society is named the
  Parnell Shakespeare Club, from the district of Auckland so called;
  the name having been given in the early days of the colony, from
  one of H.M.'s Secretaries of State, afterwards Lord Congleton.
  Auckland itself is named from another of the leading Englishmen
  of those days, Lord Auckland, who was Governor-General of India,
  and from whose family name our famous Auckland extinct volcano
  received the name of Mount Eden, the Auckland division of the
  province also being named the county of Eden.</p>
<p>June 14 and 15.--These days were taken up with meetings and
  the writing of official letters.</p>
<p>On the latter of them the quarterly meeting of the Associates
  of the Girls' Friendly Society was held at three p.m. On these
  occasions, when I am at home, I hold a short service in the private
  chapel before the [123/124] meeting, and present their cards
  to new Associates, after the special Lesson. Afterwards I presided
  at a meeting of the executive committee of our Diocesan Choral
  Association, in our Diocesan Office, when Mr. T. Tallis Trimnell,
  late organist of S. Peter's, Sheffield, was appointed choir-master
  for the coming festival. Mr. Trimnell is a superior organist,
  and one of the best accompanists that I ever heard.</p>
<p>June 16.--Among our visitors to-day was Mr. Reid, Queen's
  Remembrancer for Scotland, and formerly secretary of Mr. Gladstone's
  committee when he was first elected M.P. for Midlothian, who
  was making a tour round the world for the benefit of his health.
  He was already feeling better, after a short stay in Australia
  and a few days at Auckland.</p>
<p>The annual meeting of the subscribers of our Sailors' Home,
  of which I am President, was held; the chief business being the
  election of the Council for the ensuing year, and of a vice-president.
  Captain Anderson was re-elected to the latter office.</p>
<p>I heard to-day on good authority that one of our principal
  Auckland firms had lost more than £200,000 in their trade
  among the islands (the Samoan and Tongan groups) during the last
  few years.</p>
<p>June 17.--In the afternoon, we paid a visit to our old friend,
  Mr. Robert Baillie Lusk, at Devonport, the township on the north-west
  side of the Auckland Harbour. Mr. Lusk is now nearly eighty-nine
  years of age, and may be called the "father" of the
  Church in this diocese. He was once a bookseller in Glasgow,
  where he was an elder of the Kirk, until he was disqualified
  for the office by his uniting with the Rev. McLeod Campbell,
  whose [124/125] opinions on the universal efficiency of the Atonement
  were condemned by the highest Presbyterian authorities. Mr. Lusk
  was a zealous and greatly respected member of our Diocesan and
  General Synods, and one of the two Diocesan Nominators, until
  his increasing deafness induced him to resign all these offices.
  He now lives in retirement with his unmarried daughter, but continues
  to read theological books and to take a lively interest in all
  good works. It is always a great treat to have a talk with him,
  but we can rarely find time to visit him. In the evening, I gave
  an address in the schoolroom of Holy Trinity Church, Devonport,
  of which the Rev. Joseph Bates is incumbent, on the "home
  teaching" of children. The meeting had been called at the
  request of Mr. Brown, one of the senior members of the Wesleyan
  body in that district.</p>
<p>June 19, Sunday.--I preached at S. Paul's, Auckland--a Queen's
  Jubilee sermon, the prayers being said by the incumbent, the
  Rev. C. M. Nelson. This building is of wood, and will eventually
  be the schoolroom of the parish; but it is at present the parish
  church. S. Paul's was the original church of Auckland, built
  of brick in 1840. It was afterwards enlarged, and would hold
  a congregation of seven hundred. In 1885, it was pulled down,
  to enable the city authorities to lower the site, in order to
  effect improvements in the streets of that neighbourhood. The
  site remains the property of our General Synod, to whom--that
  is, to the trustees--£4750 were paid as compensation for
  the removal of the church. Unless another site, equally good,
  can be obtained by exchange, the new church will be built where
  the old one stood. There are many hallowed [125/126] associations
  connected with this site, especially that of Bishop Patteson's
  consecration in 1861; so that our people generally will rejoice
  if this is the case.</p>
<p>June 21, Tuesday.--The day appointed for H.M.'s Jubilee, on
  the completion of the fiftieth year of her reign. A public holiday
  throughout the British Empire. A day of heavy showers in Auckland,
  with very muddy roads. Our general Jubilee service was held in
  the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Archdeacon Dudley's; and, notwithstanding
  the inclemency of the weather, there was a large congregation,
  including most of the clergy of the city and suburbs. The service
  was short and very hearty. The singing, especially of the National
  Anthem, was so enthusiastic, that one person said to me that
  he could hardly refrain from waving his hat and cheering. The
  prayers were said by the Rev. W. Beatty, Warden of St. John's
  College, and the Lessons read by Archdeacons Dudley and Maunsell.
  All were struck by the strength and clearness of the latter's
  reading of Romans xiii., Dr. Maunsell being now in his seventy-eighth
  year. I preached the sermon, taking for my text S. Peter's words,
  "Honour the king." The collection, amounting to about
  £15, was for the building of the Church House in London.
  The Holy Table was tastefully decorated with beautiful camellias
  from Bishopscourt--crimson, pink, and white. Some of these flowers
  measured five inches in diameter. The tree on which they grow
  is about fifteen years old, and is in height eleven feet. It
  originally bore only small crimson flowers, but now they are
  generally of a deep pink, with white streaks and spots; there
  being on two sides of the tree other trees bearing respectively
  white and pink [126/127] flowers. The soil in which they grow
  is clay, mixed with scoria ash. In the evening, the principal
  street in Auckland had some handsome illuminations, and between
  8 and 9.30 p.m. it was paraded by a large part of the population--the
  crowd being estimated at about ten thousand persons. I walked
  up and down the middle of the street, and could not but notice
  the absence of roughness or rudeness of every kind. It was the
  best-behaved crowd of its size that I was ever in; and I have
  been in many in many countries. There were torchlight processions
  of our Naval Volunteers and the Salvation Army, for which the
  crowd made way respectfully. I did not hear of any one being
  hurt.</p>
<p>June 24, Friday.--In the afternoon, I held a Confirmation
  in the chapel of S. Johns College, Tamaki, for some of the boys
  of the Rev. T. F. King's school, at present domiciled in the
  college buildings. Mr. King was at the time laid up with bronchitis.
  The service was, however, reverently conducted, and in every
  way as it should be; the boys of the school chanting the psalms
  and singing the hymns heartily and well.</p>
<p>June 25.--The <i>Southern Cross</i>, Mission vessel, arrived
  from Norfolk Island, the head-quarters of the Melanesian Mission,
  about four hundred miles to the north-west of New Zealand, and
  six hundred miles from Auckland. The vessel brought Bishop Selwyn,
  Mrs. Sclwyn, the Rev. Dr. Codrington, and twelve Melanesian young
  men. Mrs. Sehvyn was on her way to Sydney, to stay with her relatives
  for some months, during the Bishop's absence among the islands--the
  Banks, Florida, and Solomon groups. Dr. Codrington was on his
  way to England, having accepted from Wadham College, [127/128]
  Oxford, of which he is a Fellow, the vicarage of Wadhurst, in
  the diocese of Chichester. His departure is greatly deplored
  by the Mission, to which he has devoted himself and his for twenty
  years; having joined Bishop Patteson in 1867. [In a letter written
  on July 15, one of the Melanesian girls says to E., "I must
  tell you about our father, Dr. Codrington, who has gone away
  from us. Mother, it is sorrowful about him. We all cried about
  him, because he is our father."] He had before accompanied
  the Bishop on one of his voyages, in 1863. Dr. Codrington's special
  work has been to superintend the teaching at Norfolk Island,
  whither scholars of both sexes are brought by the Mission vessel
  from the islands annually visited by the Missionaries. He is
  the greatest authority living on the languages of these islands,
  on which he has written a very exhaustive book, recently published
  by the Clarendon Press. In recognition of the value of this work,
  the University of Oxford, in 1885, conferred on him the degree
  of Doctor of Divinity.</p>
<p>Dr. Codrington took up his quarters at Bishopscourt, where
  he is a special favourite with our children, as well as a highly
  esteemed friend of our own. As we had no other spare room to
  offer the Bishop and Mrs. Selwyn, they occupied a lodging just
  outside our grounds, so as to be able to come to us easily at
  any time. The twelve Melanesians were lodged at S. Stephen's
  Maori School, within five minutes' walk of our house. They were
  quartered in the original brick building there; a good-sized
  room, with a fireplace being allotted to each set of three.</p>
<p>June 26, Sunday.--In the morning, I went to Mangere (about
  seven miles), accompanied by E., and held a [128/129] Confirmation
  in S. James's Church, a solid building of dark scoria stone,
  erected by the Maories at their own cost in 1857. The land in
  the neighbourhood of the church was confiscated after the Waikato
  War, in which Potatou, who formerly lived there, was engaged
  against the Queen's troops. Afterwards three acres, including
  the church site, were restored by the Government to the Maories,
  being conveyed to three of them, who now hold it for the Church
  of England. No Maories now live in the neighbourhood; but the
  building is regularly used by the European settlers, who are
  ministered to by the Rev. Middlewood Kirkbride. He was in 1886
  admitted to Deacon's Orders by me, on the understanding that
  he was not to be required to give up his farm in the neighbourhood.
  Mr. Kirkbride was the licensed Lay Reader of the district for
  many years, conducting Sunday services regularly at S. James's,
  and in the schoolroom of the district, several miles from the
  church. Mr. Kirkbride is highly esteemed by his people, among
  whom he dwelt as a layman for fourteen years. He is a man of
  literary tastes and of considerable reading, and has published
  a poem, "The Arch-Druid," the result of much study.
  It was a bright, warm day, fortunately for our Melanesian visitors.</p>
<p>Bishop Selwyn was fully employed, as he always is when he
  visits Auckland. He was celebrant at the eight a.m. service at
  S. Mary's, near which he was lodging; at ten a.m. he took part
  in the Melanesian service in the Bishopscourt chapel; at three
  p.m. he addressed the Sunday-school children at S. Mary's; and
  at the evening service he preached there. Dr Codrington devoted
  himself to the Melanesian boys, [129/130] with whom service was
  held daily in the Mota language, in the morning and evening-,
  in our chapel. A boy from Torres Island (about lat. 13° S.,
  long. 167° E.) played the harmonium. The singing was strikingly
  good. Before the morning service, and sometimes after, the Melanesians
  sat about in our balcony, revelling in the sunshine. Their behaviour
  was excellent at all times; showing the good influence exercised
  on the roughest natures by intercourse with such men as Bishop
  Selwyn, Dr. Codrington, and other members of the Mission staff.
  Dr. Codrington treated them at all times as a wise father might
  treat his children. He had them "in his heart," and
  they knew it, and their bearing towards him was in keeping with
  that knowledge.</p>
<p>After the evening service at S. Mary's, I gave an address
  on Missionary work in Hindustan, addressed primarily to the members
  of the Church of England Working Men's Society of the parish.</p>
<p>To end the day, Bishop Selwyn and his wife, Dr. Codrington,
  E., and I, sat round the wood fire in our dining-room, talking
  of many things, until nearly eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>June 27, Monday.--The Melanesians came to matins and vespers
  in the chapel every day this week; and in the morning or afternoon,
  or both, they were taken by their devoted friend, Dr. Codrington,
  to see some of the Auckland sights.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I held a conference with Archdeacon Dudley
  and my examining chaplains--the Revs. J. Bates, W. Beatty, C.
  M. Nelson, and G. H. S. Walpole--respecting the admission of
  one of the students of our college to Deacon's Orders. In our
  [130/131] circumstances it is impossible to lay down a hard and
  fast rule as to the examination to be passed by candidates for
  the diaconate. Some of them have had little opportunity of acquiring
  any knowledge of Latin or Greek, but are men of experience, and
  of gifts specially qualifying them to do good work as clergymen.
  As a rule, we do all we can to encourage our young men to study
  for the B.A. degree of the University of New Zealand.</p>
<p>In the evening, at eight, the Parnell Shakespeare Club met
  at Bishopscourt. The first two acts of "Richard II."
  were read; the King's part being taken by Bishop Selwyn, whose
  reading was much admired. I took Bolingbroke.</p>
<p>June 28, Tuesday.--A day of interviews. E. stays at home every
  Tuesday afternoon, to see those who wish to see her. It had been
  made known that Mrs. Selwyn also would be here to receive visitors,
  and consequently a great many callers came; the day, moreover,
  was very bright and warm.</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to the technical drawing class, held
  in one of the rooms of the Training College in Auckland. It is
  conducted by Mr. Robinson, who appears to be a very accomplished
  teacher. His pupils are young men employed in iron foundries,
  or as builders, or plumbers, and are required to draw on a large
  scale, and colour, all the parts of the machinery with which
  they have to do, sections of buildings, etc.</p>
<p>The thermometer fell during the night to 44° 30' in our
  house, lower than we had ever before seen it there.</p>
<p>June 29, Wednesday, S. Peter's Day.--The eighteenth anniversary
  of my consecration in Westminster Abbey. [131/132] The Archbishop
  of Canterbury (Dr. Tait) had with him on the occasion the Bishop
  of Lichfield (Dr. G. A. Selwyn), who preached the sermon, the
  Bishop of Ely (Dr. Harold Browne), and others. These two Bishops
  "presented" me. Dr. Chambers and Dr. Marsden were at
  the same time consecrated to the dioceses of Labuan and Bathurst.
  The former resigned in 1879, on account of ill health, and the
  latter in 1885. I began the day this year by celebrating the
  Holy Communion at S. Sepulchre's Church, at 8.15 a.m. At eleven
  a.m. there was Holy Communion in the private chapel, at which
  Bishop Selwyn was celebrant. Afterwards there was a meeting of
  the S. Barnabas' Ladies' Association; the object of which is
  to help the Melanesian Mission and the lady members of the staff.
  The Association ordinarily holds its annual meeting on S. Barnabas'
  Day; but it was postponed this year until the expected arrival
  of Bishop Selwyn. The Association maintains a scholar at the
  Mission School, that is, contributes £10 a year towards
  her expenses, and is getting together an endowment to maintain
  another. The scholar's name is Ipue. She is from Santa Cruz Island,
  in accordance with the wish of Miss Atkin, who specially desired
  that the first scholar maintained should be from that island.
  At our meeting on this day, Bishop Selwyn gave an interesting
  address on the recent progress of the Mission work, and Dr. Codrington
  added a few words respecting the work at 6". Barnabas' College,
  Norfolk Island. The treasurer of the association is Miss Georgina
  Roskruge.</p>
<p>In the evening, we all went to S. Sepulchre's, where Bishop
  Selwyn preached; the day being the anniversary of the consecration
  of that church, as well as of my own. [132/133] To Bishop Selwyn,
  as to myself, it is specially pleasant to take part with our
  good and honoured friend, Archdeacon Dudley, in the public worship
  of his church. Bishop Selwyn's sermon was the best I ever heard
  him preach, that is, the most thoroughly thought out and most
  carefully arranged.</p>
<p>June 30, Thursday.--The Rev. J. Still and his wife arrived
  from Wellington, to see their friends of the Mission. Mr. Still
  is a great favourite with many of our Auckland people, as indeed
  he is wherever he is well known. His fine presence and muscular
  development greatly impressed the diminutive inhabitants of the
  Islands, when he went amongst them as a member of the Mission
  staff. The Islanders used to take pleasure in measuring his calves
  and the length of his nose. Had he been a missionary to the natives
  of New Zealand, our Maories might have called him appropriately
  "Tokatumoana" (Rock standing in the sea). At ten a.m.
  I married, in the private chapel, an old soldier of H.M.'s 53rd
  Regiment to the daughter of one of the oldest Bay of Islands
  settlers. I cannot, of course, be expected often to "take
  marriages," especially when doing so involves a journey
  and a consequent loss of several hours, which I can ill spare
  from my proper duties; but I always feel that soldiers and the
  children of our oldest settlers have a special claim on my services.
  This particular soldier reminded me of an interesting occasion
  on which we were before together, namely, at the fight at Coorsee,
  on March 23, 1858, after the capture of Lucknow. General Sir
  Hope Grant commanded the column, which consisted of the 6th Brigade
  (Horsford's), namely, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Rifle
  Brigade, [133/134] the 53rd Regiment, etc. On our return inarch
  to Luck-now a very strange thing happened. The column was halting
  to rest in a grove of fine mango trees, in one of which--high
  up, over our heads--an artilleryman espied what looked like a
  bird's nest, and, with the instinct of his race, he of course
  threw a stone at it. It was a hornets' nest; and in less than
  a minute a cloud of hornets dropped on to the backs of the artillery
  and cavalry horses, stinging them into madness, and attacking
  indiscriminately the European and Indian soldiers. The greatest
  confusion resulted, and the column was not got together again
  and able to advance for a considerable time. This event was a
  striking illustration of the wisdom of the adage, <i>Quieta non
  movere</i>.</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to Woodside (about thirteen miles)
  to the reopening of the little church, S. David's, after the
  addition of an apsidal chancel. Such additions to our country
  churches are tokens of the faithful work of the clergyman in
  charge of the district. Wood-side (the Maori Papatoitoi) forms
  part of the Rev. O. R. Hewlett's charge, whose head-quarters
  are at Papakura; where he visits many congregations, receiving
  from them about £150 a year, on which he contrives, by
  strict economy, to subsist. His people are willing to increase
  this poor maintenance, but are at present unable to do so, owing
  to the general agricultural depression. At the Woodside service
  Evening Prayer was said by the Rev. F. Gould, of Otahuhu, who
  was in charge of the district when the original church was built;
  and one of the Lessons was read by the Rev. H. Hayward, who has
  a small farm in the neighbourhood, but has no pastoral charge
  in the diocese.</p>
<p>[135] July 1, Friday.--In the evening, there was a large gathering
  of friends at Bishopscourt, to meet the Bishop of Melanesia and
  Mrs. Selwyn and the Rev. Dr. Codrington. About 250 persons were
  invited, and 160 came, including Sir G. Grey, Archdeacon and
  Mrs. Dudley, Dr. Shortland, the Rev. J. Still, Mr. Pierce, and
  other old friends of the first Bishop Selwyn and of the Melanesian
  Mission. In warm weather, when we are able to open the doors
  from the drawing-room into the balcony, we can ask three hundred
  or more guests to an evening "at home," without fear
  of their being inconveniently crowded; but in the winter we are
  obliged to stop at 250. Whether we invite 250 or 350, we nearly
  always discover, when it is too late, that several whom we intended
  to invite have been omitted. On this occasion, the buzz of conversation
  justified Dr. Codrington's saying to Mr. Still, "It is not
  unlike landing at Saa;" but the crowding was much less than
  what I have experienced at a London crush at the height of the
  season. I remember retreating, after getting half up the stairs
  at Sir Stafford Northcote's (when he was Secretary of State for
  India), without doing more than bow at a distance to Lady Northcote,
  as I saw no prospect of reaching the drawing-room within a reasonable
  time. Our guests began to arrive at eight, and had all gone before
  10.30. At nine p.m. all assembled in the Library, where Bishop
  Selwyn and Dr. Codrington gave short, interesting, and unconventional
  addresses on some of the superstitions and customs of the Islanders.</p>
<p>At these gatherings we do not offer our friends an expensive
  banquet, which we cannot afford, but only tea and coffee, with
  bread-and-butter and cakes.</p>
<p>[136] In the summer we sometimes have a Garden Party, to which
  we invite any number; our grounds being extensive and admirably
  suited to that kind of gathering; the trees being many and umbrageous,
  and the view over the harbour very charming. Bishopscourt stands
  on the brow of a hill, with the grounds sloping down towards
  the sea, and facing the sunny North, with great capabilities
  for a garden. A man in my employment once said to me of the site,
  intending to annoy me, "The gentleman's place I was at in
  England was beautiful--all level, like a board; but this is such
  a hugly place--all hup and down." When the General Synod
  was in session at Auckland in 1886, we issued cards to about
  a thousand persons. Between six and seven hundred came to the
  gathering. The only expense we incurred on the occasion was for
  the hire of a band, in addition to the ordinary tea and bread-and-butter
  of these outdoor entertainments. Even if we could afford it,
  we would not offer our guests wine <i>ad libitum</i>; and we
  think it right, in any case, to show that people need not forego
  the pleasure of exercising hospitality because they cannot afford
  to give expensive delicacies in the way of eating and drinking.</p>
<p>July 3, Sunday.--In the morning, we went to Otahuhu, about
  nine miles, where I held a Confirmation at eleven o'clock. The
  clergyman of this parish is the Rev. F. Gould, of whom mention
  has already been made. A beautiful day, but very cold in the
  shade, especially in the church, which has high trees between
  it and the sun. Our wooden churches and houses in New Zealand
  need all the sun they can get in winter. It is a true saying
  [136/137] in reference to our houses of kauri pine, "Where
  the sun enters not the doctor docs." On our way home we
  met Bishop Selwyn, Mrs. Selwyn, and Mr. Still, on their way from
  St. Mark's (where the Bishop had been preaching) to St. Sepulchre's
  (where he was to address the children at three), walking. The
  distance is more than a mile. At six p.m. Bishop Selwyn preached
  at S. Paul's to a crowded congregation. I was at S. Matthew's
  in the evening, holding a Confirmation. S. Matthew's is in the
  heart of Auckland, and is our second oldest city parish. It is
  more like a town charge in England than any of our other parishes.
  The church is of wood, and will hold about seven hundred persons.
  A Stone Church Building Fund was begun in 1852, and now amounts
  to about £15,000. For many years the growth of the fund
  has been the product of compound interest only. Great credit
  is due to the trustees of the fund--at present Messrs. J. Burtt
  and W. S. Cochrane--by whom interest at the average rate of eight
  per cent, has been obtained, with good security.</p>
<p>The present Incumbent of S. Matthew's is the Rev. W. Tebbs,
  of Queen's College, Cambridge. When the incumbency of this parish
  was last vacant, the Board of Nominators--consisting of two diocesan
  members elected by the Synod, and three parochial members elected
  by the vestry of the parish--delegated the selection of a clergyman
  to the Rev. A. R. Tomlinson, my senior Commissary in England,
  by whom Mr. Tebbs was nominated to me for institution. The Bishop
  has, of course, the right to refuse to institute a clergyman
  duly nominated; but there is an appeal from such refusal to the
  bench of Bishops. On a former occasion of a [137/138] vacancy
  in this cure the selection of a clergyman was delegated to the
  Rev. Dr. Vaughan, Master of the Temple, London; and in both cases
  the deed of delegation, when sent to England, was accompanied
  by a document signed by me, saying that I would institute the
  clergyman nominated in accordance with the terms of the deed.</p>
<p>Mr. Tomlinson has selected two other clergymen for us for
  town parishes in Auckland, namely, for S. Mary's and S. Mark's.
  In each case he was authorised to offer a stipend of £400
  with a house, and passage money. Some of our people disapprove
  of the custom of sending to England for clergymen for our town
  parishes; on the ground that the clergy who have done good work
  in the country districts of the diocese ought to be appointed
  to the town charges when they become vacant. It would, however,
  be a mistake to restrict the choice of the Board of Nominators
  to the clergy of the diocese; and, as a matter of fact, the Board
  has not always gone beyond the diocese for a city incumbent.
  On the whole, I have found our system of nominating incumbents
  to work well. Mr. Tebbs has improved the machinery of his parish
  by the addition of a fine schoolroom; S. Matthew's being the
  only parish possessing a Church day school; and we are mainly
  indebted to him for our new Cemetery Regulations. Mrs. Tebbs
  is an accomplished musician, and occasionally officiates as organist
  at S. Matthew's, and is also an active Associate of the Girls'
  Friendly Society.</p>
<p>July 4, Monday.--A day of meetings. Whilst I was at the Council
  of our University College, E. was engaged with the Committee
  of her Women's Home. [See Appendix, D, p. 347 (Report for 1886).]
  This [138/139] institution was begun by her, with the help of
  a few friends, in 1884. Up to the present time about a hundred
  women have been received into the Home. Of these, a large proportion
  have derived much benefit therein. The affairs of the Home are
  managed by a Committee, consisting of Archdeacon Dudley, the
  Revs. J. S. Hill and G. H. S. Walpole, Mrs. Cowie, Mrs. J. M.
  Clark, and Mrs. Kinder. The chief responsibility has necessarily
  rested with E., who is the Superintendent. She has given a great
  deal of time and thought to the work, and has had to do most
  of the begging to obtain funds to carry it on. Mrs. Kinder is
  the honorary secretary and treasurer, and takes great interest
  in the welfare of the Home. From the beginning of the work E.
  has received zealous and valuable assistance from her, not only
  in counsel and personal service, but also financially. Moreover,
  her former experience in work of this kind, with Lady Martin,
  renders her co-operation specially helpful. Mrs. Kinder's devotion
  to work in which she believes, like her devotion to her friends,
  is not half-hearted. The ordinary expenses of the Home amount
  to about five pounds a week. Of that sum, about two pounds is
  at present obtained by the laundry work of the inmates. The Home
  is close to Bishopscourt, so that E. is able to visit it easily,
  whenever she can spare the time; and she can be consulted at
  all times by the resident Matron. One palpable result of the
  good work done at the Home is the cessation of infanticide in
  this part of the colony. Many of the women who have been sheltered
  there were the victims of scoundrels professing honourable intentions,
  who absconded as soon as there was a prospect of exposure. The
  following is a sample of the cases in [139/140] which the Home
  has rescued the injured from worse wrong, and has helped them
  to recover their position, or to make a fresh start in life.</p>
<p>E. was asked, through our telephone, whether she could receive
  into the Home a young woman who had just arrived from England,
  and knew no one in Auckland. She was at once received, and proved
  herself to be worthy of the consideration that was shown her.
  It was afterwards ascertained that the woman had been put on
  board a ship in the Thames by her seducer, a man much her senior,
  who promised either to meet her on her arrival at Auckland, or
  to arrange for some one to meet her with money. Of course no
  such friend met her; and, without money as she was, she would
  have been in sad condition indeed but for the Home. Whilst there
  her conduct was in every way exemplary. After the birth of her
  child, she went to a neighbouring colony, at the invitation of
  a near relative. Her child died when it was three months old;
  and the mother returned to New Zealand, where she entered the
  service of a neighbour of ours, and gave great satisfaction and
  was much respected. What might not have been her fate, without
  the Home, and the motherly treatment she received there? This
  woman was a Presbyterian, as others of the inmates of the Home
  have been. Roman Catholics, and members of almost all other sections
  of Christians, have also been received there.</p>
<p>On one occasion, in answer to E.'s inquiry of a Roman Catholic
  woman, who was applying for help, why she did not make her case
  known to her own priest, the applicant said, "You see, they
  have no families of their own, and they don't understand things."</p>
<p>[141] July 5, Tuesday.--In the afternoon, I presided at the
  ordinary monthly meeting of the Melanesian Mission trustees.
  As Bishop Selwyn was in Auckland, he was asked by the trustees
  to attend the meeting, if he had any communication to make to
  them. He accordingly came, and informed us that he contemplated
  selling the <i>Southern Cross</i>, his present vessel, and having
  a larger one built, of about fifty additional tons, with a suitable
  hold, for the conveyance of stores to the Islands. I was very
  glad to hear of this intention, as I have long felt that the
  <i>Southern Cross</i> is too small for the convenience and the
  health of the missionaries and their scholars, as well as for
  other purposes.</p>
<p>July 6, Wednesday.--The <i>Southern Cross</i> was to have
  left to-day for the Islands, and accordingly we had a farewell
  service in the private chapel, with those who were about to leave
  us and some of their friends. I was celebrant, and Bishop Selwyn
  and Dr. Codrington assisted me. For the Gospel I read that for
  the Fifth Sunday after Trinity, viz. the beginning of Luke v.,
  which seemed to me specially suitable for the occasion. Among
  the congregation were Archdeacons Maunsell and Dudley, the Rev.
  Dr. Kinder, and the Revs. E. J. Phillips, A. G. Purchas, and
  G. H. S. Walpole; and Mrs. Selwyn, Mrs. Ashwell, Miss Maning,
  Mrs. Purchas, Mrs. Kinder, and E., who led the singing. Among
  the special prayers said was one for the Mission, composed by
  Bishop Patteson, as follows:--</p>
<p>"O Lord Jesu Christ, Who didst walk upon the Sea of Galilee;
  Who didst calm the waves thereof, and safely bring Thy Apostles
  to the haven where they would be: We humbly beseech Thee to bless
  Thy servants the [141/142] clergy of the Melanesian Mission.
  Give Thy holy angels charge over them to keep them in all their
  ways. Preserve them from the dangers of the sea, and from all
  v that may hurt them. Prosper their endeavours to spread the
  knowledge of Thy Word among the multitude of the isles; and so
  fulfil our prayers for their safe return that we may praise Thee
  more and more, Who with the Father and the Holy Ghost art blessed
  for ever. Amen."</p>
<p>Among the communicants were our twelve Melanesian friends,
  to whom Bishop Selwyn and Dr. Codrington administered the bread
  and wine. The [142/143] offertory collection (£1 19 <i>s</i>.
  11 <i>d</i>.) was for the Endowment Fund of the S. Barnabas'
  Ladies' Association. The <i>Southern Cross</i> was detained until
  the 8th, first by a mistake as to the depth of water needed to
  float her over a mudbank in the harbour, and subsequently by
  an adverse wind. [Our daughter (<i>aet</i>. 14) afterwards received
  a letter, of which the following is a translation, from one of
  the Melanesian youths, Walter Gala, a native of Gana, on Santa
  Maria Island, in the Banks group, about 14° 10' S. lat.,
  167° 35' E. long. The handwriting was that of an educated
  man. "July 17, 1887. "To Katharine Cowie. "Friend,
  I now write briefly to you. I write with fear, for I do not know
  how to write letters well. I cannot tell you properly about anything,
  but I will tell you about our return from you. We lingered in
  the sea, but reached Norfolk Island, and on July 14 landed. All
  the people at Norfolk Island were still quite well, and I keep
  relating to the black people about our stay with you there. They
  rejoiced very much when we returned, and they gathered round
  us, desiring only to hear a word about that place Auckland. And
  I also tell the girls about you. They desire very much to see
  you, and I show them your photograph, and they wonder greatly
  at your hair being so very long. And I tell them that you gave
  us flowers continually, and they hear with pleasure. I am quite
  out of breath with telling the women about you, and about the
  things there, and about the houses and shops. I am tired of telling
  them all about it, for I do it every day. "It is true that
  it is difficult for me to send you anything now, for I have not
  yet reached my own country. If I shall reach there, I will then
  send you something. The sweets that you gave me--the girls ate
  some, and I distributed some to the boys. It is finished. I cannot
  write at length to you. Good-bye to you, Katharine. "I,
  Walter Gala, wrote to you with very great love."]</p>
<p>July 8, Friday.--The <i>Southern Cross</i> left Auckland for
  Norfolk Island and the groups of islands on which the Melanasian
  Mission has stations, taking Bishop Selwyn, Mrs. Ashwell, Mr.
  and the Misses Lodge, and others, and the twelve Melanesians
  who had been on a visit to Auckland. E. and I, Mrs. Selwyn, Dr.
  Codrington, Archdeacon Dudley, the Rev. A. G. and Mrs. Purchas,
  and other friends helped them into the ship's boat at the Queen
  Street Wharf. E. remained on board the vessel to the last with
  Mrs. Selwyn, and came ashore with her when the vessel was ready
  to move off from her anchorage. There was a short service on
  board before the parting. Mrs. Selwyn bore it bravely, as few
  wives could. The wind being fair, the <i>Southern Cross</i>,
  with the help of her propeller, which can work up to four knots
  an hour, soon rounded the green mound which forms the entrance
  to our harbour from the north. Steam is only used on special
  occasions. The Bishop was at the helm as the vessel passed under
  the Bishopscourt windows. He thoroughly understands navigation,
  as he does everything else connected with the work of the Mission.
  In this and in other respects, as in countenance, he is more
  than ever like his father. More could not be said in commendation
  of any missionary. Whilst it can be truly said of his devotion
  to the affairs of the Mission that he is <i>totus in illis</i>,
  it seems to be a real [143/144] luxury to him, wherever he may
  be, to allow himself no rest in order that he may be always helping
  some one in some way with his money, his time, his thoughts,
  and at the sacrifice of all repose of mind and body. The Rev.
  J. and Mrs. Still left us, to return to Wellington.</p>
<p>July 9, Saturday.--Mrs. Selwyn and Dr. Codrington were with
  us. The latter showed us his beautiful photographs of places
  visited by him in Asia, Africa, and Europe, on his way to and
  from England in 1883 and 1885.</p>
<p>July 10, Sunday.--A very bright morning, followed at noon
  by heavy squalls of rain from the west. I rode to S. Alban's,
  Mount Roskill (about three miles), where I preached. This is
  our newest suburban church. The population in its neighbourhood
  is at present sparse. The site was given by a Mr. Paice, formerly
  in the employment of Bishop Abraham when he was a master at Eton.</p>
<p>The church was opened in February, 1886, when the General
  Synod was in session in Auckland. The Primate preached on that
  occasion. The clergyman is the Rev. E. J. Phillips, who was for
  some years an officer on a steamship of the Peninsular and Oriental
  Company, and afterwards a settler in the Kaipara district of
  this diocese. After the death of his wife, he entered S. John's
  College, Tamaki, where he had the benefit of the Rev. Dr. Kinder's
  tuition, until his admission to Deacon's Orders. After six years
  of faithful work in the West Waikato district, Mr. Phillips became
  one of Archdeacon Dudley's coadjutors in 1885, with the charge
  of the Mount Roskill section of the parish. All the arrangements
  of S. Alban's are much according to rule, and conducive [144/145]
  to reverence. Mr. Phillips's daughter is the organist of the
  church, and his sons are all members of the choir. Their friend,
  Miss Hunter, is a valuable helper in all Church work.</p>
<p>July 12, Tuesday.--In the afternoon, I was at a meeting of
  our Lay Readers' Association; the purpose of which is to encourage
  mutual sympathy and help among those who are doing lay readers'
  work in the diocese, and to assist the members by obtaining suitable
  volumes of sermons and other theological works. The affairs of
  the Association are managed by a committee; and the books are
  kept in our Diocesan Office, a room in a building in the main
  street of the city. The Rev. J. Ilaselden was to-day elected
  our secretary, in place of Mr. F. Larkins, who resigned at this
  meeting, in anticipation of leaving Auckland soon for London.
  During his sojourn in Auckland of about thirteen years, Mr. Larkins
  has given much help to several of our Church institutions, and
  he will be greatly missed by many. He can never be forgetful
  of Auckland, inasmuch as in the churchyard of S. Mark's, Remuera,
  there are the graves of Mrs. Larkins and their only son, as well
  as that of a grandchild. John Russell Larkins died in May, 1886,
  a few days after his return home from England, where he had obtained
  an open scholarship at Exeter College, Oxford, soon after his
  arrival in England from Auckland two years before. He was a young
  man of great promise, being always distinguished by high moral
  principle, untiring industry, and unusual ability for the acquisition
  of foreign languages, ancient and modern. He was very tall of
  stature; and seems to have put too great a strain on his mind,
  in his various [145/146] studies, at a time when it needed rest,
  during the rapid growth and development of his body.</p>
<p>July 13, Wednesday.--Mrs. Kissling, senior, dined with us.
  Her late husband was a native of Wirtemberg, and came to New
  Zealand in 1842, and died in 1866. He was, during the latter
  part of that period, Incumbent of S. Mary's parish, Parnell,
  and Archdeacon of Waitemata (Auckland). Mrs. Kissling is now
  in her seventy-ninth year, and is beloved and respected by all,
  old and young, who know her, for her unvarying gentleness and
  kindliness to those with whom she has to do. Mrs. Selwyn left
  us for Sydney, where she intends to stay some months, during
  her husband's voyage among the islands of the South-West Pacific.
  During her last sojourn in Auckland she has become known to our
  people, and has endeared herself to many who have had an opportunity
  of making her acquaintance. In 1886, Mrs. Selwyn accompanied
  the Bishop on his visit to Santa Cruz Island, which was for several
  years avoided even by our missionaries, on account of the savage
  ways of the inhabitants. It was there that three of Bishop Patteson's
  companions were mortally wounded in 1864, and Commodore Goodenough
  received a like wound in 1875. Mrs. Selwyn landed on this island,
  and on others in the same region, with the Bishop, and was received
  in a friendly manner by the natives. Her calm and quiet bearing
  would always help her in her dealings with wild people, whether
  black or white. Mrs. Selwyn acquired at Norfolk Island a colloquial
  knowledge of the Mota language, the lingua franca of the Mission,
  with great facility, and has proved herself a true helpmeet to
  the Bishop, as a member of the teaching staff of S. Barnabas'
  [146/147] College, as in other ways. The other ladies of the
  Mission may well congratulate themselves, as they do, on having
  in the Bishop's wife so competent and desirable a coadjutor.
  Mrs. Selwyn went to Australia by the S.S. <i>Wairarapa</i>, one
  of the fine boats of the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand,
  a vessel of 1786 tons and 1750 horse power, fitted up with every
  modern convenience, including the electric light. This Company
  has four steamers of larger tonnage than the <i>Wairarapa</i>,
  and seven of somewhat smaller capacity, engaged in the coastal
  and intercolonial trade, and about twenty-five other steamers
  trading between the ports of the colony. The largest boats average
  in speed about thirteen knots on ordinary voyages. When I first
  visited our South Island from Auckland in 1870, the <i>Wellington</i>,
  a vessel of about five hundred tons, was considered the best
  on the coast. This is a fair sample of the general progress of
  the colony in seventeen years.</p>
<p>July 14, Thursday.--The day of the ordinary monthly meeting
  of our Standing Committee. At it I informed the Committee of
  my wish to attend the Conference of Bishops of the Anglican Communion,
  to be held at Lambeth, under the presidency of the Archbishop
  of Canterbury, in 1888.</p>
<p>In the evening, E. and I went to a social gathering at .S.
  Matthew's, Auckland, chiefly for the purpose of presenting prizes
  and certificates that had been gained by scholars of the Sunday
  school at the last Bishop's Prizes Examination. For sixteen years
  I have given these prizes, to those who have acquitted themselves
  with merit, in a Diocesan Examination, in subjects announced
  twelve months beforehand. This year the [147/148] examination
  was held in February, and the subjects were--some Old Testament
  characters, part of S. Mark's Gospel, the Lord's Prayer, and
  certain Church-seasons. During the previous year, lessons on
  these subjects had appeared each month in our Diocesan <i>Church
  Gazette</i>. The examiners this year were the Revs. W. Beatty
  and C. M. Nelson, and Messrs. J. W. Tibbs, H. G. Seth Smith,
  and H. Worthington. Mr. Tibbs is a master at the Auckland College
  and Grammar School. In 1879, he took honours in mathematics at
  Oxford, where he was a member of Keble College, having gone to
  that University from Tasmania with what is known as the <i>Tasmanian
  Scholarship</i>. Mr. Worthington is the head master of our largest
  primary school under the Board of Education, and one of our chief
  authorities on primary education. The competitors for the prizes
  are all examined in the same subjects by printed questions, but
  are divided into two grades--the senior, consisting of scholars
  over thirteen years of age, and the junior, of those not so old.
  The junior grade children are set easier questions. For a place
  in the first class, two-thirds of the marks must be obtained;
  for a place in the second, one-half; and in the third, one quarter.
  Prizes are given to all who are placed in the first and second
  classes, and certificates to those of the third. The first place
  in the first class this year was obtained by Basil Nelson Tebbs,
  the second son of the Incumbent of 6". Matthew's; and certificates
  were awarded to two of the same clergyman's daughters.</p>
<p>At the S. Matthew's entertainment, the fine new schoolroom,
  which holds about five hundred people, was filled to overflowing
  with children and their parents [148/149] and teachers. After
  some songs had been sung by parishioners, I presented the prize
  and certificates. Afterwards an interesting and instructive address
  was given by Major Dane, a lecturer from America, on character
  forming. A lime-light magic-lantern exhibition occupied the remainder
  of the evening. These meetings in connection with our parish
  churches are very popular in New Zealand, and do much good by
  bringing neighbours together, giving the clergyman an opportunity
  of intercourse with some of his people not often to be found
  at home in the daytime, and by affording innocent and inexpensive
  recreation and amusement in the midst of the homes of the parishioners.</p>
<p>July 15, Friday.--At three p.m. the quarterly meeting' of
  our Home Mission Society was held in the Diocesan Office. The
  purpose of the Society is to help to extend the ministrations
  of the clergy to all parts of the diocese, by making known the
  state of the country districts to our people generally, and getting
  all to take an interest in their spiritual well-being; and by
  increasing the Fund from which grants are made towards the maintenance
  of clergy in the poorer country districts.</p>
<p>At four p.m. I presided at a meeting of our Pension Board.
  The Board consists of the Bishop <i>ex officio</i>, and seven
  others elected by the Synod at its first session after the triennial
  election. The elected members at present are Archdeacon Dudley,
  the Rev. C. M. Nelson, the Hon. Colonel Haultain, and Messrs.
  G. P. Pierce, F. W. E. Dawson, M. Rawlings, and J. H. Upton.
  It was the annual meeting, at which grants are made from the
  available income--to clergymen and the widows of clergymen who
  are entitled to pensions. Our capital now [149/150] amounts to
  about £10,000, for the dioceses of Auckland, Melanesia,
  and Waiapu. At present no clergyman is in receipt of a pension
  from the Fund. Of the pensions paid to widows--of whom there
  are at present ten receiving grants--the highest is £33
  and the lowest £3. At the last meeting it was resolved
  that £191 should be divided amongst the claimants, each
  European widow receiving a small sum for every year that her
  husband had subscribed to the fund, and each Maori widow one-half
  of that sum. There is an Emergency Branch of the Fund, from which
  grants are made to clergymen needing such help--to enable them
  to go away for a change of air by direction of their doctor.
  For instance, at this meeting an application was received from
  a clergyman suffering from chronic laryngitis, who was advised
  by his doctor to rest his voice and make a voyage to the Islands;
  the clergyman's stipend being only about £150 per annum.
  A grant of £25 was made to the applicant.</p>
<p>The annual subscription paid by each clergyman to the Fund
  is £2. All surplice fees, e.g. for marriages and churchings,
  are ordered by the Synod to be paid to the Fund; and the Synod
  recommends that there should be an annual collection for the
  Fund in all the churches of the diocese.</p>
<p>In the evening, at 7.30, I attended a meeting, held in the
  hall of the Young Men's Christian Association, to consider the
  necessity for an alteration in the Education Act of the colony,
  so as to admit of selected passages of the Bible being read in
  the Government schools of the colony. The President of the society,
  the Rev. J. S. Hill, was in the chair; and among those on the
  platform was Sir William Fox, formerly Premier of the colony,
  [150/151] who gave a very interesting account of the progress
  of the educational system of New Zealand. I gave the first address.
  There is, I believe, throughout the colony, an increasing conviction
  that the Holy Scriptures should be taught in the public schools.
  At present I do not think that the many denominations would co-operate
  with the Church in this matter, further than to ask that in our
  schools selected portions of the Old and New Testaments should
  be read, by or with the schoolmaster, during school hours, at
  times to be specified by the Boards of Education. This is not
  what our Synods would like, but it is the utmost that the New
  Zealand Parliament is at all likely to agree to.</p>
<p>Looked at from a Churchman's point of view, what is wanted
  is--(1) that, where it is possible, religious instruction should
  be given by ministers of religion, and by others authorised by
  the bodies to which they belong, to the children of their Church
  or denomination at specified times during school hours; (2) that,
  where this is not possible, e.g. in most country districts, the
  schoolmaster should read, to or with the children, selected portions
  of the Bible at specified times during school hours; and (3)
  that "grants in aid" should be made to Church and denominational
  schools, in which the number of scholars and their attainments
  come up to the requirements of the proper authority. [See Appendix
  K, p. 370.]</p>
<p>July 17, Sunday.--A perfect day, of warm sunshine and cool
  air, I took the morning service, with Holy Communion, at S. Paul's;
  the Rev. C. M. Nelson being at Devonport, of which parish the
  incumbent was absent, he having gone to help a neighbouring clergyman
  who [151/152] was ill. I was struck by the goodness of the singing,
  especially of the Psalms. It is a great advantage when the clergyman
  can instruct his choir as Mr. Nelson can. In the evening, I was
  at S. Sepulchres, where the Rev. Dr. Codrington preached--for
  the last time, we fear, in New Zealand. It was an instructive
  and suggestive sermon, as one expected it would be, on the justice
  and the love of God. Prayers were said by Archdeacon Dudley,
  and the Lessons were read by the Rev. A. G. Purchas and myself.
  Mr. Purchas and his family are among our oldest and most valued
  New Zealand friends. He was for some years Incumbent of S. Peter's
  parish, Onehunga, a settlement on the western side of the isthmus
  of Auckland, and also the principal medical practitioner of the
  district. Mr. Purchas received his medical education at Guy's
  Hospital (where he enjoyed the advantages of the teaching and
  friendship of the late Professor Maurice), and came to New Zealand
  in 1845. He was with Bishop Selwyn at S. John's College, Tamaki,
  and was ordained by him in 1847. Twelve years ago, he resigned
  his clerical work, and took up his residence in Auckland, where
  he has no regular charge as a clergyman, but gives all his time
  to his medical duties. On Sundays and other days, when not prevented
  by his professional engagements, he helps the Archdeacon at .S".
  Sepulchre's, saying the prayers or reading the lessons, with
  feeling and reverence, in a voice clear, soft, and even by nature
  and cultivation. He is a scientific musician, and a man of much
  intellectual culture.</p>
<p>July 18, Monday.--Dr. Codrington left us for England. He went
  by the S.S. <i>Zealandia</i> (3000 tons), which goes [152/153]
  to Honolulu and San Francisco. [This mail service costs the colony
  £24,000 per annum (Mr. Mitchelson, July 25). In 1886-87
  it left a profit of £250 (Sir Julius Vogel, August 8).]
  Many of his Auckland friends, including five from Bishopscourt,
  took leave of him on the wharf, all feeling that they would not
  see his like again as a missionary to the Melanesians.</p>
<p>The coming general election of representatives to the New
  Zealand Parliament is now occupying much of the thoughts of our
  people. "Retrenchment" is the prevailing demand throughout
  the colony, as indeed it needs to be, according to the statements
  of a member of Parliament and a member of the Cabinet, [<i>New
  Zealand Herald</i>, July 14.] namely, that the present [Mr. Mitchelson,
  M.H.R. ] indebtedness of the colony is £34,000,000, the
  population being about 600,000, and the interest on the debt
  a million and three-quarters; and that the Customs receipts have
  fallen off about £200,000 since 1883. [Mr. Peacock, M.H.R.]
  On October 31, 1886, there were 1734 miles of Government railways
  open for traffic. "Retrenchment" has, however, been
  the demand of the people at every election since I came to the
  colony; but members, when elected, have been expected to obtain
  from the Government grants of money for their several districts,
  and the Government has always been unable to resist the importunity
  of its supporters. A colony like New Zealand would fare better
  if possessed of a constitution like that of the United States,
  in which the Executive can give or withhold on principle, without
  the fear of summary ejection from office by the votes of a disappointed
  majority of members of Parliament, voting as mere delegates.</p>
<p>[154] A young able-bodied man called on me to-day, asking
  me to help him to obtain employment in Auckland. He told me that
  he had been working as a navvy on the railway not very far from
  Greymouth, on the west coast of the South Island. He had 9<i>s</i>.
  a day at that work, and could live on 18<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
  a week, getting his food at a boarding house, but he found the
  work unpleasant in the winter season. About five hundred men
  were employed in the same work. This rate of pay is not so bad
  in these hard times!</p>
<p>July 19, Tuesday.--In the evening, we went to an "at
  home" at the Tower, Remuera, the charming home of Mr. and
  Mrs. J. M'Cosh Clark. We rarely go out in the evening, because
  we do not think it right to leave our children, especially as
  I am much away from home on duty during the fine weather, and
  because we cannot afford often to pay carriage hire for mere
  recreation. It is, however, always a special pleasure to accept
  Mrs. Clark's invitations. Mr. Clark was Mayor of Auckland for
  three years successively, and discharged the duties of the office
  to the more than satisfaction of all concerned. Having a large
  house and extensive grounds well laid out, situated in one of
  the most beautiful districts of beautiful Auckland, overlooking
  the sparkling waters of the Waitemata Harbour and islands near
  and distant, he was able during his long term of office to exercise
  most acceptable hospitality to the people of Auckland, and to
  many distinguished visitors. Mrs. Clark is specially gifted as
  a hostess, being gracious to everybody, desirous of helping all
  who need her aid, and most interesting as an accomplished painter
  and a woman of rare good sense. On this occasion they [154/155]
  thoughtfully sent their carriage for us, so that we went and
  returned in comfort. Mrs. Clark is one of E.'s coadjutors in
  the work of the Women's Home, in which she takes a real interest.
  Among the guests at the Tower this evening was a Major Dane,
  formerly of the United States army, who gave the company an interesting
  account of some of his camp-life experiences.</p>
<p>July 20, Wednesday.--I received a letter to-day from one of
  our most hard-working clergy, about a matter of business. He
  is a bit of a wag, and added the following postscript:--</p>
<p>"I should have written this on Monday night after the
  meeting, but--1. Mrs.------(his wife), my prompter, is away;
  2. My nurse has an abscess, and is away; 3. My scullery boy has
  scarlatina in his home, and is away; 4. My cook has pleurisy;
  5.------(his second boy) has croup; 6.------(his eldest boy)
  has recurrent whooping cough; 7. My curatrix and self have all
  the work of the house and the nursery to do; 8. I have four people
  dying in the parish; 9. I am nearly demented. That's all."</p>
<p>July 22, Friday.--Bishop Barry, of Sydney, reached Auckland
  by the S.S. Alameda from San Francisco, on his return from England,
  where he had spent five weeks, having left Sydney in March, to
  accompany Mrs. Barry, who was in very delicate health, to England.
  Two days before the vessel reached Auckland, the Bishop had a
  bad fall down the stairs leading to the saloon, having caught
  his foot on the brass binding of one of the uppermost stairs.
  He fell head foremost to the bottom, where there was, fortunately,
  a thick mat. But for it he might have been killed. His forehead
  was badly grazed, and [155/156] he received several bruises,
  but he seemed to have sustained no serious injury. The Bishop
  has left Mrs. Barry and his two sons in England. They were all
  our guests at Bishopscourt in the beginning of 1886, when they
  were making a tour through New Zealand. The Bishop preached the
  inaugural sermon at the meeting of our General Synod in Auckland
  in January of that year. Before our meeting on that occasion
  I had not seen the Bishop since he was an undergraduate at Cambridge
  in November, 1847, when he was pointed out to me (then a big
  boy on a visit to my eldest brother) as a man who was going to
  take a brilliant degree at that University. He fulfilled the
  expectations of his friends, by being fourth Wrangler, and seventh
  in the First Class of the Classical Tripos. That year, 1848,
  was famous at Cambridge for the eminent clergymen who graduated
  at the same time with Bishop Barry, namely, the lamented Bishop
  Mackenzie of Central Africa, the present Bishop of Ely (Lord
  A. Compton), the Rev. Dr. Scott (formerly Head Master of Westminster
  School), the Rev. Dr. Westcott (the present learned Regius Professor
  of Divinity), the Revs. J. L. Davies and D. J. Vaughan (the translators
  of Plato), the Rev. J. E. B. Mayor (Professor of Latin), and
  the late Dean Howson of Chester. Of the same year also were the
  late Mr. Todhunter (of differential and integral calculus fame)
  and the present Earl of Derby.</p>
<p>I met Bishop Barry at the Auckland Wharf late in the afternoon,
  and brought him to Bishopscourt, where he remained until he had
  to go on board again, to continue his voyage to Sydney. As he
  was not too fatigued to see people, we asked about twenty friends,
  whom I [156/157] was able to get at through our telephone, to
  come in for an hour or two at eight o'clock. The Bishop was at
  the opening of the People's Palace (by the Queen) on May 14,
  and at S. Margaret's, Westminster, when the House of Commons
  attended the Jubilee service, on May 22, and he preached the
  Ramsden sermon at 6". Mary's, Cambridge, on May 29. lie
  told me that he was much struck by the great poverty of "the
  poor" in London and elsewhere, compared with the well-to-do
  condition of the corresponding class in Sydney and Melbourne.
  In New Zealand the normal artisan is sometimes spoken of as "the
  man of four eights"--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Eight hours' work, eight hours' play,<br/>
    Eight hours' sleep, and eight shillings a day."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is, no doubt, one of the great compensations to an Englishman
  who resigns the charms of his native land for residence in a
  British colony, that the <font face="Symbol">oi polloi</font>
  are, as a rule, in possession of all the necessaries and some
  of the luxuries of life. It is a real pleasure to see the children
  of the artisan class going to our day schools, in town and country,
  looking healthy and happy, well-dressed, and tidy. At eight p.m.
  our Parnell Book Club held their annual meeting in the office
  at Bishopscourt for the election of a committee, the sale (among
  ourselves) of the club books, and for other business. We have
  twenty members, and the annual subscription is £1. At the
  end of the year the proposer of a book that has been in circulation
  becomes the possessor of it, on paying one-third of its cost
  price, unless more is bid for it by another member at the annual
  auction. We are able every year to purchase many new books of
  all kinds, more, indeed, than most of us have time to read, [157/158]
  and we always have a small balance to our credit in the bank.
  This prosperous state of things is mainly due to the efficiency
  of our honorary secretary and treasurer, Mr. Mark Rawlings, who
  is quite A i in business matters requiring method, accuracy,
  and punctuality.</p>
<p>July 23.--I received a letter from Mrs. Wright, the widow
  of Mr. Philip Wright, of Copford Place, Colchester, saying that
  she intended to contribute £20 a year to our diocesan funds,
  from the proceeds of her New Zealand property. For many years
  after he left New Zealand, Mr. Wright "tithed" himself
  for his Auckland estate, and gave us £60 a year, which
  was generally expended by the Standing Committee in helping poor
  country congregations. Part of the money, however, was funded
  and named the Philip Wright Fund, amounting now to £120.</p>
<p>For many years the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
  made us a grant towards the maintenance of clergymen in our country
  districts; but the Society discontinued doing so in 1880, in
  order to be able to help more needy dioceses than ours. It seems,
  however, scarcely right that shiploads of impecunious people
  without clergymen should be sent to us from England, and that
  we should be expected to provide them with the means of grace
  without receiving any help thereto from the Church in England.
  If some of those who have made fortunes in this part of New Zealand,
  and now live in luxury in England on the revenue of their New
  Zealand estate, would act on the principle of Mr. Wright and
  Mrs. Wright, our Home Mission clergy would not be as badly off
  as they are at present. Captain Rough, of Bournemouth, is another
  kind friend [158/159] who does not forget the poor resident in
  the country where he enjoyed health and prosperity for many years.
  For a long time Captain Rough sent E. £10 each year, to
  be expended in helping the necessitous. Two years ago he also
  sent £100 to be invested for the same purpose, and £100
  to be invested for the Auckland Benevolent Society. He continues
  to send E. £5 annually for the relief of the needy, at
  her discretion.</p>
<p>E. and I can rarely go together for a ride in Auckland. When
  she has no definite engagement in the afternoon--which is not
  often--I am commonly engaged, and when I am free to go out she
  is generally engaged. This afternoon we managed to ride to the
  other side of the city, where E. called on the wives of two of
  the clergy, I acting as groom, holding our horses during the
  calls.</p>
<p>July 24, Sunday.--A day of violent wind squalls with drenching
  downpours. I had to watch my opportunity to get to S. Mark's
  Church, Remuera, about a mile from Bishopscourt. Protected by
  a long mackintosh, I rather enjoy riding through heavy rain.
  My robes travel safely in a stout leathern bag, buckled to my
  saddle behind. It was the worst Sunday we had had for long. S.
  Mark's Church was not one-third full, the majority of the parishioners
  living at a considerable distance from the building, there being
  extensive blocks of grass land in its immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The incumbent of this parish is the Rev. Isaac Richards, who
  came to us from Truro in 1886, having been selected for this
  charge by my Commissary, the Rev. A. R. Tomlinson, to whom the
  nomination was delegated by the Board of Nominators. Mr. Richards
  [159/160] has already fully justified Mr. Tomlinson's choice.
  With very definite opinions on some points on which great latitude
  is allowed by the Creeds, he is tolerant of the opinions of others,
  and is appreciative of what is genuine in any of his people,
  by whatever "views" it is accompanied. He is a methodical
  visitor, and is in all things judicious and patient. The state
  of the parish funds is, with us, always some criterion of the
  clergyman's influence with his people. Notwithstanding the "hard
  times," the vestry of S. Mark's have within the year paid
  off £200 of debt incurred in past years. The church holds
  about five hundred people, and the average weekly offerings of
  the congregation amount to £7. The seat rents of the church,
  in which one-third of the sittings are free, yield about £250.
  There is scarcely any endowment.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoons, when I am at home, I read the Greek
  Testament for an hour or so with our second son, while E. gives
  the two younger children a Scripture lesson, generally taking
  the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel for the day as her subject.</p>
<p>July 25, Monday.--A day of official letter-writing, as usual.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, our Parnell Review Club held their annual
  meeting. There are sixteen members, and the subscription is £1.
  We take most of the best magazines and reviews. At the end of
  the year the magazines are sold to their proposers respectively,
  at one-sixth of the cost price, unless a better price is offered
  by some other member of the Club. Mr. Rawlings is our secretary,
  and it is therefore unnecessary to add that the affairs of the
  Club are well managed. At this meeting there [160/161] was a
  difference of opinion among the members as to whether or not
  we should continue to take one of the more modern magazines,
  on account of the bitter, almost vulgar, tone sometimes adopted
  by the editor in his attacks on Christianity. One of our members,
  a distinguished "man of science," had a year before
  protested against our aiding the circulation of such anti-theological
  stuff as often appears in this publication. It is a pity that
  the beautiful star maps of this magazine cannot be had without
  the often unscientific and offensive padding that they help to
  sustain.</p>
<p>In the evening, at seven, two young men came to be examined
  for the Board of Theological Studies. This Board is appointed
  by our General Synod, and consists of the Bishops of the province,
  and three clergymen and three laymen elected by the Synod. The
  Board appoints examiners every year, to conduct theological examinations
  in the months of July and August; the subjects of examination
  being announced two or three years beforehand, and grouped in
  four grades, of which the first is the most elementary. As a
  rule, we require our candidates for Deacon's Orders to have passed
  Grade III. before presenting themselves for Ordination. A list
  of the subjects for this year will be found in the Appendix (page
  396). It will be seen by reference to it that any one obtaining
  a good place in Grade IV. would probably be placed high in the
  First Class of the Theological Tripos at Cambridge. The secretary
  of the Board is the Bishop of Nelson; to whom the Church is greatly
  indebted for the zeal and ability with which he has discharged
  the important, difficult, and laborious duties of the office.
  One of his chief responsibilities is to secure the services of
  [161/162] an adequate staff of competent examiners in the colony,
  to set papers in the many subjects comprised in the four grades.
  My own subjects this year were the Greek and the English of the
  Epistle to the Romans. Each paper contains twelve chief questions,
  and the full marks for it are six hundred. I got my two papers
  printed in Auckland, and sent twenty-five copies of them to each
  of the other Bishops, retaining as many for this diocese.</p>
<p>There are three candidates this year for Grade I. in this
  diocese. Two of them are clerks in the employment of the New
  Zealand Insurance Company and the Auckland Board of Education
  respectively; and the third is the manager of a saw-mill in a
  district in the north of Auckland. Two of them have done good
  work as lay readers, and all three as Sunday-school teachers.
  If they pass Grade I., and continue in their present mind, they
  will probably be appointed to scholarships at S. John's College,
  where they will go though the ordinary course of instruction
  (two or three years) preparatory to offering themselves for Deacon's
  Orders. It is no small guarantee of a young man's earnestness
  and perseverance, that he has studied systematically for a theological
  examination, during his few leisure hours, when in full employment
  in such ways as I have named. Our two city candidates come to
  Bishopscourt at seven p.m., after the day's work, and write their
  answers until ten. This they will do for seven evenings.</p>
<p>July 29, Friday.--E. and I went to see the Kindergarten recently
  established in Auckland, mainly through the energy of Mrs. Ward,
  the wife of our officiating judge of the Supreme Court. The work
  is carried on in an old building that was until recently the
  Free Public [162/163] Library. The cost of the institution is
  provided for by public contributions, especially that of Mr.
  James Dilworth, who gave £100 towards the expense of beginning
  the work, and has promised an annual subscription of the same
  sum. We saw about forty children in the school, nearly all under
  six years of age. There is a matron in charge of the Kinder-garten,
  who is assisted by three young women teachers. In the <i>crèche</i>
  attached we saw two infants. The premises were clean and in good
  order.</p>
<p>July 31, Sunday.--In the morning, I preached at S. Sepulchre's,
  in the absence of Archdeacon Dudley, who was doing Home Mission
  work in the Ngaruawahia district. The prayers were said by the
  Rev. A. G. Purchas, who also assisted me at Holy Communion.</p>
<p>In the evening, I was at .S. Mary's, where I read the second
  Lesson; the first being read by Mr. L. P. Robin, one of our helpful
  young laymen, the son of an English clergyman, and a clerk in
  the office of the New-Zealand Insurance Company. The sermon was
  preached by the Rev. G. H. S. Walpole, the incumbent. It was
  a very effectual appeal, from our Lord's words, "Who say
  ye that I am?" (Matt. xvi. 15). I told him afterwards in
  the vestry that he ought to preach the same sermon at the Theatre
  service in Queen Street some Sunday night.</p>
<p>August 2, Tuesday.--The S.S. Doric, of 5200 tons and 3000
  horse power, arrived from England, via the Cape and Tasmania.
  It is not quite four years since this vessel first visited Auckland,
  being then the first direct steamer that had come to us from
  England. As a token of the great progress that the colony has
  made since [163/164] 1883, it is worth recording that there are
  at present three companies sending large steamers direct to the
  colony, viz. the "Shaw, Savill, and Albion," the owners
  of the <i>Doric</i> and five other vessels of about the same
  tonnage; the "New Zealand Shipping Company," owning
  five large vessels of somewhat less tonnage; and the "Colonial
  Union," of which the first vessel, the Balmoral Castle (2948
  tons), is now on her first voyage from London. The cargo brought
  by the Doric to-day for this port, about nine hundred tons, consists
  chiefly of railway material. The voyage from Plymouth to Auckland
  took forty-five days, including stoppages at Teneriffe, Capetown,
  and Hobart. The saloon fare by this company is sixty guineas
  and upwards. This charge is very moderate compared with what
  E. and I had to pay to get here in 1870; our fare from Marseilles
  to Melbourne alone having been £119 10<i>s</i>. each.</p>
<p>August 4, Thursday.--E. and I paid a visit to our Orphan Home
  in the morning. We went into the schoolroom, where the children
  were at their lessons, and over the whole premises. We found
  everything in perfect order. The children--seventy-two in number,
  of whom twenty-four are girls--are all in good health, though
  this is one of the most trying times of our winter season. The
  sunny hospital room had been without a tenant for a year. The
  matron spoke in the highest terms of the attention and skill
  of the Honorary Surgeon, Dr. Coom. The site of the Home is charming,
  being on high ground overlooking the sea, and facing the sunny
  north. The kitchen, under the management of Miss Welch, is a
  model of cleanliness and neatness--in itself a valuable means
  of teaching those who will hereafter teach [164/165] others in
  the homes of our artisans and agriculturists. If Edward Costley
  and others who have bequeathed money to this institution could
  see the healthy and happy appearance of the children, and could
  know the satisfactory result of the Home training, they might
  indeed be thankful for the privilege of taking part in establishing
  and extending so beneficent a work--beneficent to afflicted and
  deserving parents, beneficent to the helpless orphans, beneficent
  to the whole colony; which is now enriched by the after-lives
  of well-brought-up boys and girls, instead of being injured by
  the vicious deeds of neglected children, and impoverished by
  having to maintain them afterwards in hospitals and gaols. The
  present highly satisfactory condition of the Home is mainly due
  to the conscientious, painstaking, and experienced management
  of the matron, Mrs. Neary, who has held her present office for
  nearly five years.</p>
<p>After visiting the Orphan Home, we paid a short visit to S.
  Stephen's Maori School, which is situated on the same Church
  estate as the Orphan Home. This also is a flourishing institution,
  maintained by the rent of lands in the Farnell district of Auckland
  and the Waikato, and supplemented by a capitation grant (£18)
  from the Government for boys sent to us by the Colonial Secretary
  for Native Affairs. There are at present forty-nine Maori boys
  in the school. Mr. T. E. Davies has been, the efficient head
  teacher for many years. The steward, who is responsible for the
  domestic arrangement of the school, is Mr. J. R. Smith, formerly
  of H.M.'s 32nd Regiment, one of the famous garrison of Lucknow
  during the memorable siege of 1857. The affairs of S. Stephen's
  School are managed by a committee appointed [165/166] by the
  trustees, and consisting at present of the Rev. R. Burrows, General
  Gosset, and Messrs. T. Kissling, W. Philson, S. Percy Smith,
  and C. Roskruge.</p>
<p>At night, we went to the Drill Shed, near Queen Street, Auckland,
  to see a competition between three squads of the "A"
  Battery of the Volunteer Artillery (of which I am chaplain),
  for prizes given by two of our citizens. Most of the gunners
  are young, and nearly all are well set up. Many of them are engaged
  in trade in the town. Captain Payne, an experienced gunner, and
  well up to his work, is in command of the battery. The quickness
  and good style with which all three squads took to pieces the
  guns and limbers, and put them together again, much astonished
  me. We were specially struck by the smartness of Sergeant-Major
  Lipscombe, who (we were told) is foreman in a large furniture
  warehouse. The weak point in our Volunteer system is the impossibility
  of enforcing discipline, according to the existing law. In the
  face of an enemy, a number of men not liable to severe penalties
  for breaches of discipline would be of little value to repel
  an attack.</p>
<p>Mrs. C. C. Baker came to us with her eldest daughter for a
  few days. Miss Baker has been one of the nurses at our General
  Hospital for the last three years. A month ago she caught cold,
  and, not taking sufficient care of herself, became so ill that
  some of the doctors who saw her said that she was in a rapid
  decline, and there was "not a shadow of a hope" of
  her recovery. She is now able to walk about, and has no cough;
  and a doctor who saw her to-day says that her lungs have not
  been affected, and that her illness was of quite another kind.
  After this, we may say, <i>Nil desperandum</i>, [166/167] however
  despondent some of our medical friends may be. Mrs. Baker came
  to New Zealand in 1881, with her husband, the late Rev. C. Cole
  Baker, formerly Rector of Portshangan, in the diocese of Meath.
  Mr. Baker was just the man to suit our people in many of our
  cures; and I was hoping soon to appoint him to a pastoral charge.
  But "God disposes," while "man proposes."
  Mr. Baker bought a small farm, about twenty-six miles from Auckland;
  and had scarcely taken possession of it, when he got a chill,
  whilst engaged in digging out an old root of a tree, and died
  of congestion of the lungs. He was a great loss to us, and was
  deeply lamented by all who knew him, as a single-minded, earnest,
  well-read, and self-denying servant of God.</p>
<p>August 5.--A sub-committee of the Council of our Sailors'
  Home met to-day, to consider where the crockery, etc., required
  for the new building should be purchased. Samples of dinner plates
  were shown, to be had for 3<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. a dozen. The
  same plates had been sold in Auckland, we were told, not many
  months before, for £1 10<i>s</i>. a dozen. I could not
  obtain any satisfactory explanation of this change of price.</p>
<p>Among our guests at dinner to-day was Miss Oxland, who came
  to New Zealand last year with her sister, Mrs. Richards, the
  wife of the clergyman of S. Mark's parish, Remuera. Like her
  sister, Miss Oxland has endeared herself to many of the Remuera
  people during her short sojourn in Auckland; and her departure
  for England, which is to take place on the 9th, will be much
  deplored. She has, however, to return to her parents in Devonshire,
  where she will doubtless find as much scope for the exercise
  of her many amiable qualities as she has [167/168] found here.
  Mary Tuhaere, the daughter of the Chief of the Ngatiwhatua tribe,
  also dined with us. She speaks English well, and is at a private
  school near this house. Her father is an enlightened Maori, whose
  land is in a lovely bay (Orakei), facing the north, at the entrance
  of the Auckland harbour.</p>
<p>August 7, Sunday.--I went to the eight a.m. service at All
  Saints', between two and three miles from Bishopscourt, to receive
  to Confirmation two adults, who had recently been baptized by
  the Rev. W. Calder, the incumbent. One of them had not been long
  in New Zealand, but the other was born in the colony. After the
  Confirmation there was a celebration of Holy Communion. Mrs.
  Calder is at present in a delicate state of health, and is ordered
  by her doctor to live in a cooler and drier climate than that
  of Auckland at this time of the year; so that Mr. Calder is living
  <i>en garçon</i>, with his two sons, Basil and Jasper.
  He is, however, aided in his parish work, especially in looking
  after the children of the Sunday school, by a very efficient
  "curatrix," as he calls her, Miss Kelly. His brother
  also, Mr. C. M. Calder, recently elected a member of the Diocesan
  Synod, gives him much help. At the eleven o'clock service I preached,
  and was celebrant. There was a large congregation and a good
  choir. Among the communicants there were more men than one sees
  ordinarily at that Sacrament. I was glad to learn from the people's
  Warden, Mr. William Taylor, of whom Mr. Calder speaks in the
  highest terms, that the weekly offertory collection is more,
  rather than less, than at this time last year, notwithstanding
  the prevailing commercial depression.</p>
<p>[169] August 8, Monday.--I baptized the second daughter of
  the Rev. John King Davis--Annie Kathleen Irene--in our private
  chapel. Mr. Davis is one of those whom we regard specially as
  our "sons" among the younger clergy, his father having
  been a missionary to the Maories, and the son born and brought
  up in the diocese. Mr. Davis was educated at our Grammar School
  and our College; and he distinguished himself at both institutions,
  especially in Latin and Greek. In 1879, he was awarded a Senior
  Scholarship at the University of New Zealand for Latin, and,
  in 1882, obtained first-class honours at his M.A. examination.
  Mr. Davis's success at school and college was greatly the result--as
  he is ever glad to acknowledge--of the good teaching of the Rev.
  J. Kinder, D.D., who was successively head of our School and
  our College. At my request, the Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr.
  Tait) conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev.
  J. Kinder in 1872. My application to the Archbishop was accompanied
  by a letter from the late Sir William Martin (formerly Chief
  Justice of New Zealand), himself a man of great classical learning,
  in which he said, "Mr. Kinder is a sound and well-read scholar
  in the classical languages. This I have had many opportunities
  of knowing during the last twelve years. ... I know him to be
  a careful student of the Greek text of the New Testament, and
  well acquainted with the history of the Church. On questions
  connected with these subjects I have conferred with him frequently."
  Dr. Kinder was a Scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, where
  he took his degree in the same year with the late Bishop Woodford
  (of Ely), Charles Kingsley, Professor Munro, and [169/170] other
  distinguished men, being placed among the Wranglers of his year.</p>
<p>August 10.--I had a visit by appointment from one of the Wesleyan
  ministers of the Auckland district, who wished to be admitted
  to Deacon's Orders. I have received several such applications
  from ministers of various denominations during my time here,
  but I have only once thought it right to admit to Holy Orders
  such a candidate. In that exceptional case the applicant was
  a minister of the Independent body, and had been for several
  years virtually detached from his brother-ministers, and engaged
  in school-keeping. Moreover, he was well known to some of our
  clergy, and to many of our thoughtful laymen. Under ordinary
  circumstances, if such a candidate for ordination seems to have
  valid reasons for desiring to be received into our ranks, I offer
  to introduce him to some other Bishop of the province; so as
  to avoid, as far as possible, the giving of unnecessary offence
  to the forsaken denomination, and to make it easier for the new
  clergyman to conform to the rules and customs of the Church.
  The last Wesleyan minister who asked me (in 1886) to make him
  a deacon was referred by me to the Bishop of Waiapu, who, after
  satisfying himself of the applicant's fitness for the office,
  ordained him some months since. Last month I received a letter
  from a clergyman in a southern diocese, asking for a charge in
  or near Auckland, and reminding me of his having once been a
  Presbyterian minister in Auckland. I did not need such reminding,
  as I had never ceased to take an interest in him and watch his
  course, since the time when I introduced him to the Bishop of
  Nelson, who ordained him.</p>
<p>[171] August 12, Friday.--A commemorative service was held
  at S. Sepulchre's, in the evening, of the hundredth anniversary
  of the consecration at Lambeth of Dr. Charles Inglis, the first
  Bishop of a British colony, who received his mission from the
  English Church. His diocese--that of Nova Scotia--comprised all
  the territory belonging to Great Britain in North America, between
  Newfoundland and Lake Superior, and had twenty-four clergy. In
  the Dominion of Canada there are now seventeen Bishops and 900
  clergy; and in the colonies and foreign possessions of the British
  Crown, at the present time, the Bishops number seventy-five,
  the youngest see being that of Athabasca, founded in 1884. The
  diocese of Auckland (formerly New Zealand) dates from 1841, and
  is eleventh in order of seniority of the seventy-five. To-day
  is also the anniversary of the consecration of our New Zealand
  Primate, the Bishop of Christchurch (Dr. Harper), who was consecrated
  in the chapel of Lambeth Palace in 1856 by Archbishop Sumner.</p>
<p>At our commemoration service this evening the congregation
  was small, mainly on account of the inclemency of the weather
  and the inconvenience of the evening. The prayers were said by
  the Rev. Isaac Richards, Incumbent of S. Mark's, Remucra, and
  the Lessons read by the Rev. J. K. Davis, of Mount Albert, and
  the Rev. W. Tebbs, Incumbent of S. Matthew's, Auckland. I preached
  the sermon, taking as a motto the last verse of the first special
  Lesson, Isaiah lx. 22, "A little one shall become a thousand,
  and a small one a strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in
  his time."</p>
<p>The thermometer fell during the night to 44° 30' in [171/172]
  our house, about as low as we have ever seen it indoors here.
  For the last few days we have had strong southerly winds, with
  a bright sun.</p>
<p>Sunday, August 14.--I was at S. Mary's, Parnell, in the morning
  and evening, and preached at the former service.</p>
<p>Monday and Tuesday were taken up with letter-writing and committee
  meetings.</p>
<p>Wednesday, August 17.--I presided at a meeting of a sub-committee,
  appointed on the 15th by our University College Council, to decide
  on a design for a college seal and on other matters. I suggested,
  as a suitable motto, <i>Recti cultus pectora roborant</i> (Genuine
  modes of culture nerve the soul). [Horace, Od. IV., iv. 34.]
  It was generally approved of, especially by Sir F. Whitaker,
  who said that the <i>pectora roborant </i>expressed the determination
  of the Council to defend the College from external assaults of
  whatever kind. However, it was considered too long for the space
  available on the seal, and we adopted provisionally the milder
  <i>Meliora sequor</i>. We also substituted for the three stars
  in Mr. Wyon's design three kiwis, and for the fern above the
  shield a kauri tree or the rising sun. [The <i>Apteryx</i>.]</p>
<p>We resolved also that our agreement with Mr. F. D. Brown,
  who had been engaged by us as Professor of Chemistry for a period
  of five years, to end in May, 1888, should be renewed for five
  years more, that is, until 1893. In the evening, I was at S.
  Mary's. It is not often that I am able to attend week-day vespers
  at our parish church. On this occasion I presented a lay reader's
  licence to Mr. Leonard A. Robin, the son of an English clergyman,
  and a clerk in the New Zealand Insurance [172/173] Office. Instead
  of a sermon, I spoke to the congregation about the lay readers'
  work.</p>
<p>August 19, Friday.--In the afternoon, I presented two B.A.
  diplomas to Auckland graduates of the University of New Zealand,
  students of our Auckland University College. Degrees are granted
  by the Senate at its annual meeting, as soon as the result of
  the examination (conducted by examiners in England) is made known;
  but the diplomas are publicly presented in the month of August.
  The ceremony of presentation took place in the Choral Hall at
  3.15 p.m. There was a large gathering, almost filling the building,
  much larger than on any former occasion. On the platform were
  many graduates, of divers universities, in gowns and hoods--graduates
  in Arts, Medicine, and Law.</p>
<p>In my opening address I referred to the honour recently bestowed
  on our Chancellor by her Majesty the Queen, in recognition of
  his great scientific attainments; and said that the selection
  of such men as Sir James Hector for the dignity of a K.C.M.G.
  was an <i>auspicium melioris aevi</i> (the motto of that order
  of knighthood). I reminded the assemblage that it was ten years
  since a B.A. diploma was first presented to an Auckland graduate
  in that hall; and that the recipient thereof was Miss Kate Edger,
  the first of her sex who had obtained a B.A. degree from any
  University of the British Empire. At Cambridge, now, women may
  present themselves for the same Arts examination as the men undergo;
  but they cannot take degrees. As, however, Miss Agnata Frances
  Ramsay has just been placed in a division of the first class
  by herself, at the head of the Cambridge Classical Tripos, it
  will scarcely [173/174] be possible any longer to exclude women
  from graduating at that University.</p>
<p>Of the two Auckland Bachelors who received their diplomas
  from me, one was Miss Margaret Annabella Coleman. Among the graduates
  on the platform was another of our lady graduates, Miss C. E.
  M. Harrison, to whom I presented a B.A. diploma in 1885, and
  who took her M.A. degree in 1886. There is a separate examination
  for the higher degree in New Zealand. [The number of graduates
  of the University admitted after examination is as follows:--Bachelors
  of Arts (alone), 87; Bachelors of Arts and Bachelors of Laws,
  7; Bachelor of Laws (alone), I; Masters of Arts (alone), 45;
  Masters of Arts and Bachelors of Laws, 2; Master of Arts and
  Doctor of Laws, 1; Bachelor of Medicine (alone), 1: total, 144.
  The number of undergraduates now on the roll of the University
  is 740.] All the arrangements for the presentation ceremony were
  made by Mr. Charles E. Purchas, one of our young and promising
  lawyers, who acted as my secretary for the purpose.</p>
<p>August 20.--H.M.'s corvette <i>Opal </i>arrived from Wellington--a
  vessel of about two thousand tons, carrying twelve guns. It is
  a long time since we had a visit from a British man-of-war; the
  last such vessel having been the Nelson, the flag-ship of Admiral
  Tryon, in February.</p>
<p>August 21, Sunday.--I was at S. Mary's in the morning. The
  Lessons were read by two young laymen, Messrs. Robin and Wansborough,
  both recently licensed as lay readers. Their reading was reverent,
  intelligent, and clear.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I held my Greek Testament class.</p>
<p>In the evening, I rode to the Epiphany Church, where I preached.
  The clergyman of this church and district [174/175] is a graduate
  of the University of Salamanca. The site of the church, in the
  main street of the Newton district of the city, was purchased
  by the Diocesan Trustees in 1873 for £303, in anticipation
  of the necessity for a church in that neighbourhood. As an instance
  of the increase in the value of land in Auckland, it may be mentioned
  that this site was, in 1884, valued at £1200. The church
  was built in 1886, of kauri wood, and cost £1535. There
  is no endowment connected with it, so that all the expenses (including
  the clergyman's stipend) have to be defrayed from the offerings
  of the people. The clergyman is fortunate in having among his
  parishioners some of our most experienced and efficient lay helpers.
  Besides others, there are Mr. Daniel M. Beere and Mr. James W.
  Tibbs. Mr. Beere was for several years one of the staunchest
  coadjutors of the clergyman at Hamilton; and Mr. Tibbs is an
  M.A. of Keble College, Oxford. Most of the members of the choir
  are engaged in business in the district.</p>
<p>August 24.--Our climate for the last fortnight has been quite
  perfect. The thermometer in our balcony (with a metal roof) facing
  the sun, in the shade, has stood at 65° about two p.m., and
  the same thermometer has fallen at night to 46°. The sky
  has been almost cloudless for days together, and the air cool,
  with a southerly breeze. What better early spring could be found
  anywhere? No doubt, the influx of residents and visitors for
  the "enjoyment of existence" will go on increasing,
  as the many great advantages of this part of the colony come
  to be better known, and as the fares of the ocean steamship companies
  are lowered. The scenery of Auckland and its suburbs cannot be
  surpassed [175/176] in beauty of its kind; and the necessaries
  of life, and many of its luxuries, are to be obtained here at
  a smaller cost than in the few other cities of the world that
  I am acquainted with enjoying similar blessings of climate and
  scenery. In support of the latter assertion, I may here quote,
  from to-day's <i>Herald</i>, some of the retail prices of farm
  and other produce in our Auckland markets:--</p>
<p>"Milk, 3 1/2 <i>d</i>. to 4<i>d</i>. a quart; fresh butter,
  1<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. a pound; cheese, 6<i>d</i>. to 8<i>d</i>.
  a pound; eggs, is. a dozen; bacon, 6<i>d</i>. to 1<i>s</i>. a
  pound; beef (for roasting). 3<i>d</i>. to 5<i>d</i>. a pound;
  mutton (hind quarter), 3d. a pound; and (wholesale) roller flour,
  £12 15<i>s</i>. a ton."</p>
<p>August 25, Thursday.--A day of committees. In the evening,
  we went out to Tamaki (about five miles) to a concert, for the
  benefit of the Home Mission Fund, given by the Rev. T. F. King,
  who has a private school in the old S. John's College buildings.
  Among those who played and sang were the three daughters of the
  Minister of the Independent congregation in Auckland; Miss Stewart,
  a Presbyterian; and members of other denominations. Such fraternal
  help does much good, direct and indirect. Miss Stewart is the
  principal operator at the head office of our Auckland Telephone
  Exchange. She is so expert at her duties that, whenever she is
  absent from her post, the subscribers grumble at the comparative
  slowness of her <i>locum tenens</i>. It is necessary to sec her
  at her work of "switching" to appreciate the skill
  with which she does it. After seven hours of such employment--from
  nine a.m. to twelve, and from one p.m. to five--requiring unflagging
  attention and constant exercise of memory, absolute rest of brain
  [176/177] must be needful, and even singing at a concert must
  be a weariness. Of our own people who took part in the concert,
  there were Mrs. James Dacre and Miss H. Corbett, both of whom
  are always ready to help a good cause by the artistic use of
  "the best member that they have." [Psa. cviii. I.]
  The old College Hall was tastefully decorated for the occasion;
  the selection of music was well made; and the performance was
  excellent. There was a large audience, considering the small
  population of the Tamaki district, and the music and singing--under
  the able direction of Herr Tutschka--were much appreciated. The
  school choir sang a glee and a chorus very creditably. The energy
  and good management of Mr. and Mrs. King were the subject of
  general admiration. Such social gatherings have a very beneficial
  effect on the boys of the school, all of whom take their part
  in making the preparations. We were impressed by the courteous
  manners of Mr. King's pupils.</p>
<p>Herr Tutschka is the teacher of music at the school. His pupils
  do him much credit. As a competent critic says of them, "There
  is a finish about their playing," that bears testimony to
  superior teaching, including the instilling of enthusiasm into
  the taught.</p>
<p>August 26, Friday.--In the evening, we went to All Saints',
  Auckland, to a Sunday-school festival. We arrived at 7.30, after
  tea. The fine schoolroom was quite full--about four hundred children,
  and many teachers and parents, being present. I first presented
  the prizes gained by All Saints' parishioners at the last Sunday-school
  Teachers' Examination in Church History, the period for that
  occasion having been A.D. 100 to 500. I give these [177/178]
  prizes annually, to encourage our Sunday-school teachers, to
  improve their knowledge of ecclesiastical history. The AII Saints'
  teachers greatly distinguished themselves at the last examination,
  a prize and a certificate respectively being gained by the brother
  and the wife of the incumbent of the parish, the Rev. W. Calder.
  Afterwards I presented the Bishop's Prizes to the successful
  candidates at the last examination, in February. A large proportion
  of the whole number of prizes and certificates given this year
  was gained by children of this school.</p>
<p>August 27, Saturday.--In the late afternoon, we went to the
  Public Free Library, in the heart of our city, an institution
  of which Auckland may well be proud. We found a large number
  of people, men and women, and a good many big boys and girls
  (none under fourteen years are admitted) sitting at the tables
  reading, strict silence being preserved. The new building was
  opened on March 26, 1887. The Auckland Free Library and Art Gallery
  was built at the cost of the ratepayers, £20,000 having
  been borrowed for the erection of the building, which contains
  also the municipal offices. The design was furnished by Messrs.
  Grainger and D'Ebro, of Melbourne. The whole cost of the building,
  including the furniture, was about £27,500. The Reference
  Library apartment is large enough to hold 350 persons comfortably
  seated. One of the most interesting sections of the library consists
  of the valuable collection of books (between eight and nine thousand
  volumes) given by Sir G. Grey. The library and gallery will be
  maintained partly by the interest of the Costley bequest [178/179]
  (£12,150), which at present yields an. income of about
  £800. It is intended to expend the whole of this sum annually
  on the purchase of books. The library rate--one halfpenny in
  the pound--yields at present about £750, and the Government
  subsidy is £50, making the total revenue for the past year
  about £1600.</p>
<p>August 28, Sunday.--A day quite perfect, of unclouded sunshine
  and cool temperature, without dust or wind. In the morning, I
  rode to S. Luke's, Mount Albert, about three miles from Bishopscourt,
  and held a Confirmation. The clergyman in charge is the Rev.
  J. K. Davis, already mentioned. The church was tastefully enlarged
  in the time of Mr. Davis's predecessor, the Rev. J. Haselden,
  and was originally built when the district formed part of the
  charge of Archdeacon Dudley, who is ever on the outlook for fresh
  centres of work. The site was given by Mr. A. K. Taylor, the
  owner of a large estate in the neighbourhood, comprising much
  scoria land, hereafter to be covered with houses, in which health
  will be enjoyed by thousands who are more or less invalids when
  dwelling on a clay soil. In the afternoon, I rode on to Avondale
  (two miles further along the same road), where there is another
  pretty little church, S. Jude's, situated on the hillside, overlooking
  a sunny plain stretching away towards the ranges on the west
  coast of the island. This church is a memento of the zeal and
  the practical talents of the Rev. J. Haselden; the congregation,
  like that of S. Luke's, having first been brought together and
  ministered to by Archdeacon Dudley in 1872. The church this afternoon
  was quite full; some of the congregation--Presbyterians and [179/180]
  Wesleyans--having, no doubt, come to see the Confirmation. Before
  the second Lesson I presented a certificate, gained by Mr. Archibald
  Morrison, the lay reader, at the examination held annually by
  the authority of the General Synod. Mr. Morrison was, unfortunately,
  absent, having gone, at short notice, to conduct public worship
  with another country congregation, whose own lay reader was unable
  to act. In the morning, Mr. Morrison's place at S. Jude's was
  taken by the lay reader of S. Luke's, Mr. W. C. Kensington, who
  would otherwise have been with his family at the latter church.
  It is no little self-denial, to a man with several young children,
  to leave his family for a great part of Sunday, the only day
  of the week on which he can see much of them, when his office
  is in Auckland, three miles distant. After the service I asked
  Mr. Bollard, one of the pillars of the Avondale Church, about
  the state of the people in the district in these times of financial
  depression, and was glad to hear that few young men thereabouts
  could complain of not being able to make an honest livelihood.
  If other employment could not be obtained, he said, there was
  gum-digging to be done close by, at which 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
  a day could be made without much difficulty. [The buyers of kauri
  gum are said to be paying away in Auckland at present £7500
  a week.]</p>
<p>September 1, Thursday.--In the evening, we went to a conference
  of Sunday-school teachers, held in the school-house of S. Mary's
  parish. An interesting paper was read by the incumbent, the Rev.
  G. H. S. Walpole, and a "model class" was taken by
  the Rev. P. S. Small-field, whose subject was the deliverance
  wrought by [180/181] Gideon. Mr. Smallfield illustrated his teaching
  by drawings on a blackboard, and with a miniature flail, and
  little card-board tents. We could not remain to hear the paper
  of the Rev. J. Bates, as we had another engagement, in a distant
  part of the city, at S. Thomas's, of which the Rev. W. M. Du
  Rieu is incumbent. There we found a large assemblage of the parishioners,
  met for a "social gathering." Mr. Du Rieu was giving
  a reading as we entered, when he courteously paused, and the
  whole assemblage politely rose to their feet, and remained standing
  until we were seated. After the reading there was music and a
  recitation. The evening had begun with a high tea, and at 8.45
  refreshments were handed round, and we had an opportunity of
  speaking to some of the people. At 9.30 there was to be a dance;
  and as we could not be of any use to the dancers, we gave them
  more space by departing. Such gatherings do much good, direct
  and indirect. They are a token of the interest the clergyman
  takes in "the whole," as well as the sick of his people;
  they give him a convenient opportunity of improving his acquaintance
  with many of the parents; and they provide recreations that are
  at least innocent when indulged in with moderation and in the
  presence of parents and neighbours.</p>
<p>September 2, Friday.--In the evening, we went to a Sunday-school
  entertainment in the school-house of .9. Sepulchre's parish,
  Archdeacon Dudley's. My special reason for going was to present
  some prizes and certificates that had been awarded to young people
  of this parish at the last annual examination for the Bishop's
  Prizes. The .S. Sepulchre's school-house was formerly [181/182]
  the church of the parish, and is conveniently situated for many
  of the people, but not for so many as is the new church, in the
  Khyber Pass Road. We found between four and five hundred people,
  the great majority children, seated, and listening to readings,
  recitation, and music. Proceedings had begun, as usual, with
  a high tea, at which we were not present. It was a great pleasure
  to see so many healthy and happy-looking children, and to know
  that they were being cared for by the Church. Mr. Edward Hammond,
  an experienced teacher, and one of our best Maori scholars, is
  the Superintendent of the school.</p>
<p>September 3, Saturday.--A day of violent squalls of wind and
  rain from the west. I went to Hamilton by train (eighty-six miles).
  In one of the longest first-class carriages I was the only passenger
  for part of the way, and there was only one other passenger for
  any distance. I have often travelled in this fashion on our Auckland
  and Waikato line. It seems a very extravagant system--providing
  so much more accommodation than is required, or fixing the fares
  so high as to make them prohibitive to the many who would be
  travellers if they could afford it.</p>
<p>As this visit to Hamilton was for a special purpose, and I
  had no engagements in the settlement, I availed myself of the
  proffered hospitality of Colonel and Mrs. Forbes, who are occupying
  the Lake House, about two miles out of Hamilton. This house was
  built by Mr. A. Cox in 1873, when it stood exposed on the high
  ground above the lake. It is now sheltered from the cold west
  and south winds by high trees, chiefly pines, of which few are
  more than fifteen years old. Colonel [182/183] Forbes met me
  at the station and drove me to his beautiful home. He came to
  Hamilton in May last, soon after his arrival in New Zealand,
  on a year's leave from his appointment of Commissioner of Fyzabad,
  in the North-West Provinces of India. Colonel Forbes is an officer
  of the Royal Artillery, but has for many years held civil employment
  in that country. In the afternoon, in the quiet of Lake House,
  I got through some writing and reading.</p>
<p>September 4, Sunday,--Another day of violent squalls of wind
  and rain from the west.</p>
<p>Colonel Forbes drove me in to S. Peter's, where I was celebrant
  at the eight a.m. service.</p>
<p>I spent the day at the Cottage, as the guest of our old friend
  Mrs. Gwynne.</p>
<p>The Volunteers were at the eleven a.m. service, and I preached
  to them, taking for my text 1 Cor. xiv. 8: "If the trumpet
  gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?"--from
  the second Lesson. The Rev. R. O'C. Biggs said prayers. The church
  was quite full. In the afternoon, I gave an address to the children
  of the Sunday school, and presented a Bishop's Prize to Miss
  Mary Jane Kingsley, who obtained a high place in the last Teachers'
  Examination in Church History. Immediately after the Morning
  Service, Mr. Biggs, accompanied by one of his daughters, set
  out for Tuwhare (about twelve miles distant), one of his outlying
  stations, where he holds a Sunday service once in four weeks.
  He returned in time to say prayers at the seven o'clock service,
  when I preached, taking for my text a verse from the second Lesson,
  [183/184] Mark vi. 41: "When He had taken the five loaves
  and the two fishes, He looked up to heaven, and blessed and brake
  the loaves, and gave them to His disciples to set before them."
  Before the first Lesson I presented a lay reader's licence to
  each of four laymen, who had been commended to me in the ordinary
  manner for that office, namely, Colonel Forbes and Messrs. S.
  T. Seddon, A. Swarbrick, and C. Nettleship. Colonel Forbes has
  had much experience of this honourable work in India, where imperial
  officers, civil and military, are often called upon to conduct
  the service in our churches, for the solitary chaplain, absent
  on duty at some out-station, or on short leave in the hills.
  Colonel Forbes informs me that he has been accustomed on such
  occasions to read the simple and scholarlike sermons of the Rev.
  James Vaughan, of Brighton. I once heard Mr. Vaughan give a short
  extempore address on a Wednesday evening in his Brighton church,
  and was greatly impressed by his matter and his manner. On leaving
  the church on that occasion I met the assistant-minister, with
  whom I had a slight acquaintance. I asked him how long he thought
  it took Mr. Vaughan to prepare so admirable a discourse, and
  he answered, very truly, "His whole life, to be sure."</p>
<p>Of the other Readers licensed to-day, Mr. Seddon held for
  some years a licence from Bishop Selwyn, for the Howick district,
  where he formerly resided; Mr. Swarbrick has before helped the
  clergyman of the district; and Mr. Nettleship is the master of
  the Board School at one of Mr. Biggs's out-stations--Pukete.</p>
<p>September 5, Monday.--At eleven a.m., at S. Peter's [184/185]
  Parsonage, Hamilton, I met the clergy of the archdeaconry (of
  Waikato); namely, the Ven. W. N. de L. Willis and the Revs. R.
  O'C. Biggs, R. G. Boler, and J. Marshall; also the Rev. J. Haselden,
  Organising Clergyman of the diocese, who happened to be passing-through
  the district. We had an unofficial consultation on the Church
  work of the archdeaconry. Mr. Marshall told us that he recently
  had a journey of fifty miles to baptize a child. I had to leave
  Hamilton in the afternoon for Auckland, and so was unable to
  attend the quarterly Conference of clergy and lay officers, which
  met at four p.m.--a sort of rural deanery meeting.</p>
<p>As far as I could ascertain, there was no lack of employment
  for able-bodied and, industrious men in the Hamilton district.
  Honey was selling at twopence halfpenny a pound, and the necessaries
  of life were proportionately cheap.</p>
<p>September 8, Thursday.--A typical home day. Bath at 6.30 a.m.
  Children's lessons at 7.30 a.m.--E. M., Plato's "Apology
  of Socrates;" J., Greek exercise; K. and A., Latin exercise.
  Breakfast at 8.15. Chapel at 8.45. Seeing visitors on business
  all the morning, intervals being filled up with official writing.
  Dinner at 1 p.m. Writing from 2 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. Standing Committee
  at 4.30 p.m. Official writing and reading to 10.30 p.m.</p>
<p>September 9, Friday.--We heard by telegraph of the death of
  the Rev. H. P. te Taua, one of our most valued Maori clergy.
  He had been complaining for some weeks, but was not thought to
  be seriously ill. It was he who accompanied us to Kaitaia in
  April. On Sunday, September 4, he did his work as usual. On Thursday;
  [185/186] he went to a funeral, contrary to the advice of friends,
  and was scarcely able to get through the service; and on his
  return to his own house, he went to bed, where he remained until
  his death. The Bishop of Waiapu happened to be on a visit to
  his daughter close by, and did what he could for our departing
  brother, who was able to say the Lord's Prayer with the Bishop.
  Mr. H. T. Clarke, a brother of the Archdeacon, says of Te Taua,
  "When I was once in great trouble and distress, he came
  to sec me (with the late Rev. R. Paerata), and he spoke as an
  earnest and warm-hearted Christian minister only could speak."</p>
<p>September 10, Saturday.--The Rev. B. W. Harvey, D.D., Head
  Master of the Whanganui School, dined with us. He had been at
  Waiwera, where there are hot-water springs, to obtain relief
  from rheumatism, and had derived much benefit.</p>
<p>September 11, Sunday.--In the afternoon, I held a Confirmation
  at S. Mark's, Remuera. The church was quite full, and the service
  was bright. The Rev. I. Richards had taken great pains with his
  candidates--twenty-one men and youths and nineteen young women,
  whose bearing was all that could be wished. It is not usual for
  the male candidates to be more in number than the females; and
  when this is the case, it is a token of a clergyman's faithfulness
  in visiting his flock, and of the influence that his ministrations
  have gained over the young people of his charge.</p>
<p>During this week we had many visitors.</p>
<p>September 17, Saturday.--In the afternoon, I went by train
  to Hclensville (thirty-eight miles), to the northwest of Auckland,
  the place from which small steamers [186/187] go to the Kaipara--an
  inland sea--and to the N. Wairoa river, the longest in the colony.
  Among my fellow-passengers were a young medical man and a candidate
  for a seat in the Parliament just about to be elected. The former
  is a son of an Irish clergyman who held a charge in this diocese
  for some years, and subsequently returned to Ireland. The son
  went home, to study medicine in Dublin, and, after a sojourn
  of six years in Ireland, during which he passed his examinations
  with distinction, and acquired some experience in his profession,
  he returned to New Zealand, and established himself at Helensville.
  He gave me to understand that he greatly preferred his work there
  to what it would have been in Ireland.</p>
<p>My other acquaintance--a candidate for a seat in the new Parliament--had
  been a member of the House of Representatives for a short time
  only; but during that time he had been led to think very poorly
  of the political morality, he told me, of some of our leading
  politicians. Indeed, he spoke very despondently of the manner
  in which the government of the country was being carried on.
  I reminded him of the maxim that history is the best of cordials
  to a troubled mind, weighed down by national difficulties, and
  assured him that the present troubles of New Zealand were small
  in comparison with those from which less favoured countries have
  extricated themselves in all ages of the world.</p>
<p>At Helensville I was met by Mr. C. Cockerton, a student of
  S. John's College, Auckland, who goes to this district for two
  Sundays of each month, his expenses being paid by the congregation.
  This is one of the districts in which our people are not able
  to provide a [187/188] maintenance for a resident clergyman,
  and which are visited periodically by the organising clergyman
  of the diocese.</p>
<p>The primary object of my visit on this occasion was to hold
  a Confirmation, several candidates having been prepared for that
  rite by Mr. Cockerton and others. My quarters at Helensville
  have always been at Mr. Hook's boarding house, where Mrs. Hook
  makes visitors very comfortable at a very small charge. For each
  meal and for each night's lodging I have always paid one shilling.
  Among my fellow-boarders were two clerks belonging to the railway
  office.</p>
<p>September 18, Sunday.--I held service at S. Matthew s, Helensville,
  in the morning and evening, being assisted on both occasions
  by Mr. Cockerton. In the afternoon, the candidates for Confirmation
  met me in the church, and I spoke to them about some of the articles
  of the Apostles' Creed.</p>
<p>At the evening service, the Confirmation took place after
  the Third Collect. The church was crowded, the congregation was
  reverent, and the singing was hearty. The organist was a quondam
  Marlborough boy, now holding office in the saw-mill of the settlement.
  [A few years ago I met the same Marlburian at the Sunday evening
  service at another saw-mill, of which the manager was an Etonian
  and a quondam University oar. On that occasion there were also
  present, in an out-of-the-way district, three other young men
  who had been at public schools, severally--at Winchester, Harrow,
  and Rugby.] It is a great help to a country congregation to have,
  in the office of organist and choir-trainer, an educated gentleman,
  who has been accustomed to the reverent ways of conducting public
  worship that are now usual at the [188/189] great English schools,
  and who tries to impart to others some of the good training he
  has himself received in such matters. On the other hand, much
  harm is done by an irreverent organist, who knows what is becoming
  in his position, and deliberately does the opposite. [<i>Corruptio
  optimi pessima</i>.] I have sometimes been pained by the conduct
  of such a one during public worship. He not only does not stand
  up during the saying of the Creed and the Psalms; but, lolling
  about on his seat ostentatiously, turns over the pages of the
  music-book--when not engaged in playing the instrument; and his
  own special duty--to play the accompaniments--is generally a
  display of himself, rather than a support to the singing of the
  choir and the congregation. It were far better to be without
  music at public worship than to have to put up with the odious
  ways of such a musical performer, especially in churches which
  are only periodically visited by a clergyman.</p>
<p>The mainstay of the Helensville congregation is Mr. Burton,
  who has--for more than eight years--discharged with zeal and
  efficiency the duties of churchwarden and lay reader. At Helensville,
  as in other parts of the colony, those who are willing to work
  are, for the most part, able to obtain remunerative employment,
  notwithstanding the prevailing commercial depression. Much of
  the land in the neighbourhood of the settlement is very poor;
  but there is always work going on in connection with this terminus
  of the railway, and with the extension of the line in the direction
  of Kaukapakapa (about six miles distant); also in connection
  with the wharves and with the saw-mill.</p>
<p>September 21, Wednesday.--I married the Rev. N. D. [189/190]
  Boyes to Miss M. J. Nield in the chapel at Bishopscourt. Mr.
  Boyes came to the colony in 1883, and, after being employed for
  a short time under the Wellington Board of Education, entered
  at S. John's College, to study for Holy Orders. After passing
  Grade III. of our theological examination, he was admitted to
  Deacon's Orders by me in 1886, and appointed to a country district,
  where he has done faithful work. The bride arrived a few days
  before from England, having been engaged to Mr. Boyes for some
  years. Miss Nield, who is an experienced teacher, holds a high
  certificate from the Educational Department in England.</p>
<p>As a rule, I am not able to comply with requests to perform
  marriages; but I never decline, if I can help it, to marry clergymen
  and soldiers, and the sons and daughters of clergymen, soldiers,
  and old settlers. It is not the custom to make the officiating
  clergyman any present, pecuniary or otherwise, at marriages--at
  least, I have never received one in New Zealand, nor wished for
  one; but, whenever any offering has been presented through me,
  I have made it a rule to give it to some diocesan institution,
  and to inform the donor of my having done so. It is, however,
  very inconsiderate of some of our people, in the country, to
  ask a clergyman to ride many miles--as many as fifty on some
  occasions--to a marriage, and not to offer to pay his expenses,
  as has happened more than once during my eighteen years in this
  diocese.</p>
<p>September 22, Thursday.--In the morning-, at eleven, I married
  Mr. C. B. Morison to Miss C. A. Haultain in the chapel at Bishopscourt.
  The bride is the youngest daughter of the Hon. Colonel Haultain,
  one of the oldest [190/191] settlers of this part of New Zealand,
  and one of our most highly respected friends. The annual winter
  meeting of clergy and members of their families at Bishopscourt
  took place to-day. This gathering, from being a small affair,
  has grown--with the general growth of the colony--to be a formidable
  undertaking. On this occasion 153 guests were invited to high
  tea at six. A long table extended the whole length of the Library,
  and was tastefully decorated by Miss Sparling and Miss O'Grady,
  who also made a small bouquet for each guest. This is not a good
  time of year with us for flowers; but violets are abundant, and
  camellias are still to be had. Our white heath is, however, in
  full bloom and very beautiful, and scarlet geranium never fails
  us.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, according to our custom on these occasions,
  the clergy retired with me to the dining-room for our usual conference,
  leaving the ladies and the laymen with E. for a social evening.</p>
<p>There were twenty-seven clergymen at the Conference, one of
  them having travelled a hundred miles to be present. Most of
  the subjects discussed had been notified by me to the clergy
  some time beforehand. Of these the chief were "an annual
  diocesan examination of our Sunday schools," like that for
  the Bishop's Prizes; the economising of the time of the clergy
  in our funeral arrangements; the existing "impurity"
  of towns; and the coming Church Meeting. The conference ended
  at 10.30 p.m., when, after short vespers in the chapel, our guests
  departed. We hope, and have reason to believe, that benefit as
  well as enjoyment is derived from these gatherings, at which
  the clergy and members [191/192] of their families improve their
  acquaintance with one another,</p>
<p>September 25, Sunday.--At the eleven o'clock service at kS.
  Marys, Parnell, I admitted to Deacon's Orders, by letters dimissory
  from the Bishop of Wellington, Mr. J. M. Devenish, who had been
  for three years a student at S. John's College. During that time
  he passed Grades I., II., and III. of the theological examination
  conducted by our General Synod, and has been examined for the
  first part of Grade IV. Having been away from books for some
  time before he entered the college, systematic study was not
  easy or encouraging to him at first; but, by dint of unflagging
  perseverance, he overcame difficulties that in many good men
  would have proved insurmountable. The Ordination service at S.
  Mary's was very devotional and edifying, under the direction
  of the Rev. G. H. S. Walpole, the incumbent, and one of my chaplains.
  Morning Prayer having been said at an earlier hour, we began
  with a hymn; after which I preached the sermon, and the candidate
  was presented to me by his friend and teacher, the Warden of
  S. John's College, in the absence of the Archdeacon. The Litany
  was sung by Mr. Walpole, whose cultivated voice and freedom from
  self-consciousness combined, specially qualify him for such an
  office. The choir--of men and boys--gave the responses well;
  and the organist, Mr. Trimnell, accompanied, as usual, with good
  taste, precision, and reverence.</p>
<p>September 26, Monday.--A General Election was held to-day
  of members to our New Zealand House of Representatives, ninety-five
  in number. Nearly all those elected in this part of the colony
  had declared [192/193] themselves opposed to the present Government,
  of which Sir Robert Stout is Premier, on the ground of its financial
  extravagance. The Premier himself and another member of the Cabinet
  were among the defeated candidates.</p>
<p>This was a week of meetings, report-writing, and heavy correspondence.
  We were up at six each morning, and hard at work until eleven
  p.m., both of us, still leaving large arrears of necessary correspondence.</p>
<p>September 28, Wednesday.--In the evening, we went to a social
  gathering in the Kindergarten building, at the invitation of
  the managing committee, to take leave of Mrs. Dudley Ward, the
  founder and cherisher of the institution. Mr. Justice Ward's
  year of office, as a Judge of the Supreme Court, was about to
  terminate, as Mr. Justice Gillies, for whom he had officiated,
  had returned to New Zealand. Mrs. Ward, like some other ladies
  in New Zealand, is a preacher and lecturer. The following paragraph
  appeared in our Auckland morning paper one Monday morning:--"There
  was a large assembly last evening in the Primitive Methodist
  Church, Franklin Road, to hear Mrs. Dudley Ward, who delivered
  a plain and practical discourse on 'The New Birth,' which was
  much appreciated. His Honour, Judge Ward, assisted Mrs. Ward."
  Sir William Fox, formerly Premier of the colony, was in the chair,
  and acted as spokesman for all present, in thanking Mrs. Ward
  for the good work she had done in connection with the Kindergarten.
  Sir W. Fox is an interesting speaker; and he uses this talent,
  with many others, for the general good of the community, and
  especially in advocating total abstinence from intoxicating drinks,
  which are the cause of so much evil to many persons in the colony,
  as elsewhere. Sir [193/194] W. Fox has lived most of his New
  Zealand life in the south of this island, but is now building
  a house in Auckland, where he intends henceforth to dwell. He
  spoke in high, but not too high, terms of the natural charms
  of Auckland and its neighbourhood; and having seen many other
  lands, his testimony as to our advantages in climate, scenery,
  and other possessions is of weight.</p>
<p>September 29, Lay Readers' Day.--All the lay readers of the
  diocese, now 101 in number, were invited, individually, to meet
  at Bishopscourt at eleven a.m. Many were, of course, unable to
  come, by reason of distance and their business engagements. Our
  day began with Holy Communion in the chapel. After the Creed,
  Archdeacon Maunsell gave a very instructive address. He pointed
  out the privilege enjoyed by laymen in the synagogues of the
  Jews in our Lord's days in the flesh, and in the early years
  of the Christian Church, of reading and speaking in the congregation;
  and also dwelt upon the fact that mere preaching, without conversion
  of heart to God on the part of the preacher, could not be expected
  to do much good.</p>
<p>E. led the singing of the Creed, the <i>Sanctus</i>, and two
  hymns.</p>
<p>Between twelve and one o'clock our guests rested in the drawing-room
  and strolled about the grounds. At one o'clock there was dinner
  in the Library, the table having been tastefully decorated with
  spring flowers by Miss Sparling, who also had made a beautiful
  bouquet for each person present. Besides the lay readers, there
  were at the entertainment Archdeacon Dudley; the Rev. G. H. S.
  and Mrs. Walpole; the Revs. F. Gould, [194/195] C. M. Nelson,
  and J. Haselden; Mrs. C. J. Wilson; and Miss Sparling.</p>
<p>At two o'clock, the tables having been cleared, we met again
  in the Library for business; some more lay readers and a few
  of the clergy having in the mean time arrived.</p>
<p>Among the readers present were Mr. C. Haselden, Mr. C. J.
  Wilson, Mr. H. Crispe, Mr. Richards, Mr. Gover, Mr. Burton, Mr.
  Ewington, Mr. Thorp, and Captain Hearne. Interesting papers were
  read by Messrs. Haselden and Ewington.</p>
<p>We have now 101 lay readers in the diocese. Of these, about
  fifty hold my formal licence. Of the others, some prefer not
  to have a formal licence, lest too much might be expected of
  them; others are new to the work, and not sufficiently known
  to our people to enable the congregation to apply to the Bishop
  for a licence; others feel that their sojourn in a particular
  settlement is likely to be brief, or that their help can only
  be very limited or infrequent, and so think it unnecessary to
  be formally licensed.</p>
<p>Some of our licensed readers wear a surplice when conducting
  the service; but we have no diocesan rule on the subject. The
  custom varies, according to the wish of the particular clergyman
  and congregation. Our conference ended at four p.m. Many of those
  who attended it told me afterwards that they had much enjoyed
  the day, and would be helped by it. In the evening, at 7.30,
  there was a special service at S. Sepulchres, very bright and
  edifying. The Lessons were read by two of the readers--Captain
  Hearne, the [195/196] master of the Pokeno school, and Mr. H.
  G. Seth Smith. The prayers were said by Archdeacon Dudley, the
  incumbent; and the sermon--a very suitable discourse--was preached
  by the Rev. C. M. Nelson, my senior examining chaplain.</p>
<p>September 30, Friday.--In the evening, we went to the annual
  meeting of our Home Mission Society, held in the school-house
  of S. Matthew's parish. All subscribers of five shillings per
  annum are members of the society, the object of which is to interest
  our people generally in the work of the Home Mission, and to
  collect funds for the work. Two papers were read--by the Rev.
  T. H. Sprott and the Rev. J. Haselden, the honorary secretary
  of the society. Mr. Sprott came to the diocese in the beginning
  of the year from S. John's, Lambeth, where he was one of the
  parish staff. He gave us a very interesting account of the Church's
  work in that parish, which was strikingly different in many ways
  from that of the district in which he is now engaged at S. Barnabas'
  Mr. Sprott is a well-read man, of superior intellectual power,
  and is highly appreciated by his people and by us all. Mrs. Sprott's
  London experience is likewise very helpful to her in her present
  position. Mr. Haselden's paper also was very suitable to the
  occasion, giving an account of the progress of our Home Mission--<i>cujus
  magna pars fuit ille</i>--during the past year, and contrasting
  the state of Church work in our country districts at different
  times in the past with its condition at the present day. During
  the evening, according to our custom at such meetings, we had
  some good music and singing, provided on this occasion by [196/197]
  the choir of S. Paul's, under the direction of their minister,
  the Rev. C. M. Nelson.</p>
<p>October 1, Saturday.--The annual examination of Sunday-school
  teachers, for prizes which I give for Church history, took place;
  the Rev. W. Beatty, Warden of S. John's College, being the examiner.
  The period selected was that from A.D. 500 to 1000; and as it
  was difficult to obtain suitable books for that period, the candidates
  this year were very few.</p>
<p>October 2, Sunday.--I preached at S. Paul's in the morning,
  and at S. Mary's in the evening. Though the night was cold and
  stormy, there was a large congregation at S. Mary's, as notice
  had been given that on the following morning the removal of the
  church would begin, to make room for the section (including the
  chancel and transepts) of the new church that is about to be
  erected. The old church was originally built in 1860, and since
  then it has been added to from time to time. It is now again
  too small for the population, and is, besides, unsuitable for
  the congregation, who in summer find the heat and closeness of
  the building--chiefly from the lowness of the roof--almost unbearable,
  and in winter suffer from draughts of cold air entering through
  the wooden walls. Mr. Walpole kindly consented to my having the
  wooden cross from the top of the spire of the church. It was
  put up in 1860, under the direction of Bishop Selwyn. Many good
  people, I am told, were greatly scandalised at the time by the
  erection of a cross on the building. Most of our people, we may
  hope, have got beyond such ignorance and bigotry now, though
  one occasionally meets a man or woman to whom the cross seems
  to be the symbol of [197/198] everything that is bad, instead
  of those truths in reference to which S. Paul said, "Far
  be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
  through which the world hath been crucified to me, and I unto
  the world." ["'The cross of Christ is the instrument
  of my crucifixion as of His.' If the relative had referred to
  <font face="Symbol">Cristw</font>, we should have expected rather
  <font face="Symbol">en w</font> or <font face="Symbol">sun w</font>"
  (Bishop Lightfoot).] As a matter of fact, I have found that those
  who mostly profess alarm lest others should make a superstitious
  use of this ancient Christian symbol, are not men and women whose
  own lives recommend to the unbelieving the truths of the Gospel--by
  large-heartedness or charity. The worst instance of <i>staurophobia</i>
  that I have heard of for some time occurred recently in one of
  our country settlements, in which most of the people are from
  the northern parts of the Emerald Isle. It appears that in one
  of the service-books--the Bible, I think--of the church of the
  settlement there was a silk-ribbon marker, ornamented at each
  end with a small embossed cross. These "gods of Rome,"
  as one of the settlers called them, were discovered by a disciple
  of the person referred to, who obtained entrance to the building,
  and cut off the offending "gods," and took them away
  and destroyed them. The piety of the end, of course, justified
  the dishonesty of the means, in the opinion of this iconoclast,
  and theft under the circumstances was accounted meritorious.</p>
<p>October 5, Wednesday.--The Standing Committee, who are the
  final Court of Appeal in disputed elections, had to decide whether
  the election that had just been held of two synodsmen for an
  Auckland constituency to [198/199] our Diocesan Synod was valid
  or not. An exhaustive report of the circumstances of the case
  had been prepared by a sub-committee, consisting of the Rev.
  C. M. Nelson and Messrs. Rice and Seth Smith; and the election
  was declared invalid. This is the second appeal to the Standing
  Committee that has been made during the present General Election.
  Such litigation, whilst troublesome to the Standing Committee,
  is a token of the general interest taken by Church-people in
  the election of their representatives.</p>
<p>October 9, Sunday.--Our private chapel was used to-day as
  a parish church by some of the 6". Mary's people, whose
  own church is in the hands of destroyers. About eighty persons
  succeeded in finding room. Mr. Walpole had other services for
  other instalments of his flock in the parish school-house. At
  eight a.m. I was celebrant, with Mr. Walpole for deacon; and
  at eleven a.m. I took the whole service.</p>
<p>The afternoon and evening were very wet. I went to S. Barnabas',
  Mount Eden, at seven p.m., and held a Confirmation. When this
  rite is administered on a Sunday evening, our custom is to begin
  with Evening Prayer to the end of the Third Collect, often with
  special psalms and Lessons. Then follows a hymn, and the Order
  for Confirmation. The Rev. T. H. Sprott, minister of this church,
  which is in the parish of the Holy Sepulchre, said prayers, and
  one of our S. John's College students, being a teacher also in
  the S. Barnabas' Sunday school, read the Lessons. We encourage
  all our theological students to do Sunday work of this kind.
  S. Barnabas' Church has an interesting history. In 1847, Archdeacon
  Kissling began to collect subscriptions [199/200] for a small
  church, for the use of the Maories living in or near Auckland.
  About £400 were obtained, and the church was opened by
  Bishop Selwyn in 1849, on the brow of the cliff below Parnell,
  overlooking the harbour. In the course of time there ceased to
  be a Maori congregation in Auckland, and the church was not used
  for some years. In 1878, the trustees of the property allowed
  the building, known as S. Barnabas' Church, to be removed to
  its present site at Mount Eden, in the parish of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>
<p>The newly elected House of Representatives have met at Wellington,
  and a new Cabinet has been formed, Major Atkinson being Premier
  and Sir F. Whitaker Attorney-General. Mr. E. Mitchelson, one
  of our Auckland merchants, is appointed Minister of Public Works,
  and with that department is to be combined, for the first time,
  the Native Department. It is many years since a former Governor
  told me that, in his opinion, "there would be no native
  difficulty but for the separate Native Department of the Government."
  Mr. Mitchelson is one of those public men in whom the Auckland
  people in general have confidence, not only as a man thoroughly
  competent to superintend the very important department of Public
  Works, but as a straightforward, honourable man. I have known
  him now for many years, and whether as foreman in a country store,
  as he was when I first met him, a citizen of Auckland, or as
  an important member of the Government, he has always been a man
  to inspire trust, and to deserve and retain it.</p>
<p>October 11, Tuesday.--Among other meetings attended by me
  to-day was that of the Committee of the [200/201] Selwyn Memorial
  Fund, which now amounts to about £1350. It was begun in
  1878, after the death of Bishop Selwyn (of Lichfield), formerly
  of New Zealand; and the Diocesan Synod passed a resolution instructing
  the trustees, or committee, to allow the interest to accumulate
  until the fund amounted to £1500. It was intended that
  the fund should yield the whole or part of the stipend of a clergyman,
  whose chief work it would be to minister to the sick in our Auckland
  Hospital.</p>
<p>October 15, Saturday.--I went to Tuakau, a thinly populated
  district on the right bank of the Waikato river, thirty-five
  miles south of Auckland. The weather was wet and stormy for the
  time of year, but the country was looking beautiful. I was the
  guest of Mr. Brown, junior, the son of Mr. A. Brown, the local
  lay reader, formerly a Church officer in the diocese of Newcastle,
  Australia. The chief industry of this district is the preparation
  of flax, [<i>Phormium tenax</i>.] for which there are several
  mills in operation near the railway station. Good matting is
  now made of this fibre in the settlement. In answer to my inquiries,
  I was told that very few men were out of employment in the district.
  At Tuakau, large quantities of whitebait are taken out of the
  Waikato river from July to October, and are sent to Auckland
  in bags, sold in town for a shilling, containing as much of that
  delicacy as half a dozen people could eat with impunity.</p>
<p>October 16, Sunday.--A day of furious squalls of wind and
  rain from the west. The unmetalled roads were very muddy. I walked
  to the church, S. John's, Tuakau, about a mile. A chancel had
  just been added to the building at a cost of £40, of which
  sum £5 came from [201/202] Miss E. Ward, an old and highly
  esteemed friend of E.'s in England. Miss Ward has for many years
  sent us that sum, to be applied to any diocesan purpose preferred
  by me. On several occasions the gift has paid for some of the
  Bishop's Prises. The prayers were said by the Rev. E. J. McFarland,
  the clergyman in charge of the district, whose head-quarters
  are at Bombay, nine miles distant. The first Lesson was read
  by Mr. A. Brown, a staunch pillar of the Church at Tuakau. The
  organist, a Presbyterian lady living at a distance, was prevented
  attending by the severity of the weather; consequently the canticles
  were not chanted, though four hymns were heartily sung without
  an accompaniment. Tuakau is a very pretty district, and the land
  is good, but most of the settlers are without much money.</p>
<p>In the morning, my son Edmund, who is a good groom, arrived
  with my horse, which he had brought from Rama Rama, about thirteen
  miles distant, and in the afternoon we set out together, escorted
  by Walter Brown, my host's eldest son, for Bombay, [So named
  from the vessel in which the first settlers came to the district.]
  S. Peter's. The distance was only nine miles; but as the road
  was unmetalled most of the way, and hilly, and very muddy after
  the rain, it took us two hours to reach our destination. In fine
  weather this is a beautiful ride.</p>
<p>At Bombay, we stayed at the house of Mrs. Forde, until the
  hour of evening service. The late Mr. Forde was an officer in
  H.M.'s 83rd Regiment, and was afterwards for several years master
  of the district school here. Mrs. Forde and her daughters are
  among the best teachers of the S. Peters Sunday school. At dusk,
  I [202/203] visited the grave of the late Rev. Colpoys Cole Baker,
  in a lovely spot, close to the church, overlooking a wide and
  interesting stretch of country, between the Waikato river and
  the Manukau harbour. Near the pretty cross of white marble is
  another hallowed grave, where all that was mortal of Mrs. Proude
  and two of her grandchildren was laid. Mrs. Proude came from
  Yorkshire some years ago, to live with her son, Mr. R. Proude,
  who is the principal landowner in the neighbourhood. Her gentle,
  Christian spirit, and kind, motherly bearing were a blessing
  to all who had the privilege of her acquaintance. The evening
  service was at seven, by which time the night was unusually dark,
  by reason of the heavy clouds that were still rolling up from
  the west. There was a large congregation, including many young
  men, notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather. Evening Prayer
  to the end of the Third Collect was said by the Rev. E. J. McFarland,
  clergyman of the district. Then followed the Confirmation Service.
  The singing was hearty, the volunteer organist being Mr. Corn-thwaite.
  Mr. McFarland is a B.A. of the University of New Zealand. Though
  not a strong man, his ordinary Sunday work is much more than
  many strong men would like to undertake. On this day, after helping
  me at Tuakau, he rode (about six miles) to Pukekohe, whence he
  had come in the morning; and, after holding service there at
  3.15 p.m., he rode to Bombay (about five miles). At 6\ Peter's,
  the harsh little bell is fixed over the tiny wooden vestry, and
  consequently my head felt as if it would split before I entered
  the church. I have suffered similar agony in other small churches
  of the diocese. O good churchwardens! have pity on your [203/204]
  Bishop and clergy, and see that they have a few minutes of quiet
  when preparing to lead your worship, and thinking of the <i>lucidus
  ordo</i> in which they hope to deliver to the congregation the
  result of their study and reflection. The bell, in the case of
  small wooden churches, should not be hung in a bell-cot attached
  to the building, but in a separate structure, like the campaniles
  of the old churches of Europe, formed of three or four substantial
  posts with crossbeams. Among those confirmed on this occasion
  was a granddaughter of the late Rev. R. Taylor, one of the oldest
  clergy of the Church Missionary Society in New Zealand. After
  the service we mounted our horses again, and rode through the
  darkness to Springfield, a little more than three miles, to the
  house of Mrs. Cole Baker, where we stayed the night. We had to
  descend a long hill covered with loose stones, over which it
  was anything but pleasant to ride on a long-legged horse, after
  a tiring day's work, in utter darkness. Mrs. Baker's farm, which
  is worked by her eldest son, is a model of neatness.</p>
<p>October 17, Monday.--We were up before six, and, as soon as
  our horses were saddled, we set out for Auckland, about twenty-seven
  miles distant. I travelled most of the way by rail, the two horses
  being taken home by my son.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I attended a meeting of the Council of our
  University College, where it was resolved to engage the services
  of Professors Brown and Thomas for another term of five years.</p>
<p>Professor Brown is about to leave for England, where he intends
  to spend two months of the coming vacation. [204/205] He told
  me that he considered such a visit necessary, to keep himself
  up to his work, by making himself acquainted with the most recent
  discoveries and the newest methods of his own science, chemistry.</p>
<p>Professor Thomas has during the winter months been giving
  a series of "popular talks" at our Institute on natural
  history, much to the edification of his hearers. I look upon
  teaching of this kind as one of the most useful parts of our
  professors' work. The whole community should be able to derive
  benefit, if they wish it, from the establishment of those offices
  of teaching, maintained, as they are, by the taxes paid by us
  all.</p>
<p>This was a week of meetings for both of us, as is always the
  case when the Synod is near at hand. My day's work now begins
  before six a.m., and does not end until I am too tired to write
  any more, about eleven p.m.</p>
<p>October 22, Saturday.--I went by train to Te Awamutu (one
  hundred miles), leaving about noon and arriving at 7.55 p.m.--a
  very wearisome journey. I had a carriage to myself nearly all
  the way, from which fact it is to be inferred, I think, that
  our railway arrangements are defective. Only those obliged to
  travel by railway appear to do so, owing to the high rate of
  fares. The railway is the property of the people, who pay the
  interest on the sum borrowed for its construction. It was made
  for the public convenience, as much as any main road was; and,
  just as it is not expected that a metalled road will add directly
  to the revenue of the colony, so it would be wise, I think, not
  to make a direct increase of revenue the chief consideration
  in regulating the railway charges. In any case, however, the
  revenue cannot be benefited by making the fares so high that
  a passenger can travel [205/206] alone for nearly a hundred miles.
  By the same train travelled the Rev. T. P. N. Hewlett, one of
  our senior and most active clergymen, now seventy-two years of
  age. His head-quarters are in Auckland, whence he goes for Sunday
  to one or other of the districts in which there is no resident
  minister. On this occasion he was on his way to Huntly (sixty-five
  miles from Auckland), whence he would ride on Sunday morning
  to Rangiriri, about eight miles, for the eleven o'clock service.
  In the afternoon, he was to be at Ohinewai (half-way back) for
  the three o'clock service, and at Huntly for the evening service.
  On the following Sunday Mr. Hewlett was to be in the Papakura
  district, taking three services for his son, who was much in
  need of a Sunday's holiday. At Huntly there are coal-mines, and
  the families of the miners form the clergyman's charge.</p>
<p>The country was looking very lovely, and the weather was charming.</p>
<p>At Te Awamutu station I was met by the clergyman of the district,
  the Rev. R. G. Boler, who took me in a buggy lent by a kind churchwarden,
  Mr. Teasdale, to the house of my host, Mr. W. Sorby, the lay
  reader, about three miles from the station. The road, un-metalled,
  was full of holes and puddles, and, moreover, very hilly.</p>
<p>October 23, Sunday.--Mr. T. Hunt, of Rangiaohia brought his
  buggy for me in the morning and took me to Kihikihi (about two
  miles), where I preached at the eleven o'clock service. The church
  stands on a hill, overlooking a beautiful district. It is quite
  an ecclesiastical building, having been designed by the Rev.
  P. Walsh. The prayers were said by the Rev. R. G. Boler, [206/207]
  and the second Lesson was read by Mr. J. Hutchinson, the lay
  reader, who has a farm about two and a half miles distant, where
  he holds a Sunday school. I do all I can to encourage our faithful
  laymen to hold such schools in their own houses, for the benefit
  of the children who live at long distances from the central school.
  A large proportion of the congregation remained to Holy Communion.
  The harmonium was played by Miss Ogle, whose home is more than
  two miles distant. The churchwarden is Mr. Tristram, formerly
  of H.M.'s 40th Regiment. At Kihikihi lives the renowned chief
  Rewi, who defended his pah (entrenchment) at Orakau most gallantly
  against the force commanded by General Carey in the Waikato War
  in April, 1864. This pah was surrounded by English soldiers on
  the occasion, and was without water, so that the fate of Rewi's
  garrison seemed certain. Still, this warrior would not surrender;
  and, in answer to the general's entreaty that he would send away
  the women, said that "the Maori women were as good as the
  men," and that he would fight "ake, ake, ake"--for
  ever and ever. After returning this message to the general, he
  formed his garrison into a solid square, with the women in the
  centre; and then, when our soldiers were having their dinner,
  feeling confident of capturing Rewi and all his people, they
  sallied forth, leaping over the ditch, and, in some parts, over
  the heads of the English troops, and hurried away through the
  fern and scrub!</p>
<p>Rewi once came to see us at Bishopscourt. He was much struck
  by the long hair of our then little daughter; and, when asked
  to look out of one of our drawing-room windows at the beautiful
  view, sat still, saying, [207/208] "I can see a view any
  day, but not a head of hair like this."</p>
<p>After dinner at Mr. Sorby's, Mr. Hunt drove me to Rangiaohia
  (heaven's favours), where I preached at the three o'clock service.
  The church is beautifully situated, and was built in 1857. It
  possesses a good painted window in the chancel. The window is
  said to have been sent from London for S. Paul's, Auckland, but
  to have been declined by the authorities of that parish in those
  days, because it was "too High Church," but I doubt
  the authenticity of the report. The Maories, having no such scruples,
  gladly accepted it. For some years after the Waikato War the
  Rangiaohia church was closed, there being no congregation, as
  the Maories had left the district, which formed part of the territory
  confiscated by the Government.</p>
<p>On this occasion there was a good congregation. The prayers
  were said by the Rev. R. G. Boler. Miss Taylor played the harmonium.
  When I first saw the church it was in a ruinous condition, but
  it is now in comparatively good order, especially the interior;
  for which much has been done by Mr. and Mrs. Cottrell, new-comers
  to the district.</p>
<p>Heavy rain came on about three o'clock, and continued to fall
  until late in the evening.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt took me back to Te Awamutu (about three miles) for
  the evening service. Notwithstanding the rain and the sloppy
  state of the unmetalled roads, there was a large congregation
  at S. John's. The prayers were said by the Rev. R. G. Boler,
  who presented seventeen candidates for Confirmation. The service,
  especially the singing, was very hearty. Among those [208/209]
  confirmed was Mr. James Mandeno, who was for long the Superintendent
  of the Sunday school. His father, whose grave is in the churchyard,
  was a highly respected minister of the Independents. There are
  several interesting monuments at S. John's, Te Awamutu, erected
  by their comrades to soldiers who were killed in the neighbourhood
  during the Waikato War of 1863-64.</p>
<p>The Holy Table was tastefully decorated at the Confirmation
  with arums, lilies, and hawthorn, all of white.</p>
<p>Mr. Boler is a good sample of our "home-made" clergy.
  His first years in New Zealand gave him the physical training
  that is essential for an efficient minister of a country district.
  His home was at Tauhoa in the north, where the roads, or tracks,
  were in those days among the worst in the diocese. The Rev. H.
  D. D. Sparling, then in charge of that district, first called
  my attention to his fitness for the pastoral office. He was accordingly
  given a studentship at our College of S. John the Evangelist,
  where the Rev. Dr. Kinder was his teacher; but, as he was a married
  man, he was soon obliged to resign the appointment, to earn a
  maintenance for his family. For a few years he was employed by
  the Auckland Board of Education, during which time he continued
  his studies with effect, and passed Grade III. of our theological
  examination.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt told me much that was interesting about this district.
  Agricultural and pastoral work give little profit at the present
  time. An ox that would have sold for £12 five or six years
  ago is not worth more than £6 now. He was recently offered
  only four shillings each for fine calves, nine months old. I
  heard afterwards [209/210] that the farm on which he lives, one
  of the best in the district, would not sell for more than £5
  an acre at the present time, whereas the owner gave about £13
  an acre for it ten years ago. There is a cheese factory at Te
  Awamutu, but not now at work, there being twenty tons of excellent
  cheese in the store, and no market for it. A good deal of wheat
  is grown in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>My first visit to Te Awamutu was in 1870, when I was accompanied
  by the late Rev. Lonsdale Pritt, afterwards Archdeacon of Waikato.
  I had arrived on a Saturday, in May, just at the beginning of
  the wet season, at Alexandra, and was the guest of Mr. Aubin.
  On the following morning, I rode, through heavy rain, to Te Awamutu
  (about seven miles). About a quarter of an hour before the time
  for service, eleven a.m., I went to the church; and, finding
  no one there, I went up into the tower and rang the bell--for
  twenty minutes or so. The bell was of no avail in the pouring
  rain: no one obeyed its summons, and I accordingly mounted my
  horse, and rode back to Alexandra, where I preached in the afternoon.
  The Alexandra church at that time stood on a mound, near the
  Waipu river, and was used as a barrack by the Constabulary, the
  wooden walls being loop-holed for rifles.</p>
<p>The parsonage house at Te Awamutu is the property of the Church
  Missionary Society, who have a valuable estate in and near the
  settlement. When I first saw the building in 1870, it had two
  large wings, which were afterwards removed. It was originally
  a Maori school, of which Mr. (now Sir John) Gorst was for a time
  the master. During the Waikato War it was for some months the
  head-quarters of General Carey.</p>
<p>[211] October 24, Monday.--I returned by rail to Auckland,
  after short matins in the Te Awamutu church at 7.45. The congregation
  on this occasion consisted of the clergyman's family and a guest,
  besides myself.</p>
<p>At the Huntly station, when we arrived, we saw a large gathering
  of Maories, taking leave of a Mormon preacher, who had been making
  converts in the district. Some of my fellow-passengers, especially
  Mr. Hunter, senior, were very indignant with the Mormon visitor,
  who was said to be kissing the Maori women and girls in bidding
  them good-bye. The Rev. Heta Tarawhiti, our Maori clergyman of
  this district, has been in delicate health lately, and not able
  to travel much; consequently his flock, of whom many are very
  migratory, have been left without a shepherd, and the wolf has
  been tearing the sheep.</p>
<p>This week was taken up with preparations for the Synod. I
  was up daily at 5.30 a.m., and steadily at work until eleven
  p.m., writing, seeing clergy and others on business, and attending
  meetings of trustees and others.</p>
<p>October 26, Wednesday.--In the evening, I baptized four Maori
  youths, of S. Stephen's School, three of them from the diocese
  of Waiapu and one from the King Country, as it is called--the
  district to the south of the Waikato to which Tawhiao and the
  malcontent Maories retired after the Waikato War of 1864.</p>
<p>October 29, Saturday.--In the afternoon, we went to S. Mary's,
  to see how the preparations for next day were getting on. Since
  October 2 the nave of the old church had been moved back about
  fifty feet, to make room for the chancel and sacrarium of the
  new church, [211/212] which are to be proceeded with at once,
  at a cost of about £2000, the material being wood. We found
  the churchwardens, Mr. R. Maris Clark and Mr. S. Percy Smith,
  hard at work, putting back some of the heavy benches into their
  places--not merely directing others, but with their own strong
  arms doing the work. Such churchwardens are invaluable, not only
  for the amount of work they do themselves, but for the influence
  of their example on paid officials and on less willing members
  of the congregation. Archdeacon Govett and Miss Atkin came to
  us, the former to stay during the session of the Synod, the latter
  to be present at her godson's confirmation.</p>
<p>October 30, Sunday.--In the afternoon, there was an interesting
  Confirmation service at S. Mary's. Among those who received the
  rite were our daughter, Katharine Vaughan, for whom our dear
  friends, the Dean of Llandaff and Mrs. Vaughan, and Miss K. Keene,
  were sponsors, and our second son, John Patteson, for whom Archdeacon
  Dudley, the Rev. Dr. Codrington, and Miss Atkin were sponsors.
  It was very satisfactory to us having our children prepared for
  this apostolic and helpful rite by the Rev. G. H. S. Walpolc,
  who takes wreat pains with his candidates, and, as the Archbishop
  of Canterbury said of him, is "a clear teacher." The
  whole number of young people presented by Mr. Walpole was fifty-four,
  including twenty-one Maori youths from S. Stephen's School. There
  is no part of my work that gives me more pleasure than the holding
  of a Confirmation, when the candidates have been carefully taught
  and prepared. In many cases, the opportunity that a clergyman
  has--of influencing the after-lives of young [212/213] people
  for good--when he is preparing them for Confirmation, is greater
  than any other that ever occurs to him or to them.</p>
<p>October 31, Monday.--The climate of Auckland at this season
  is quite perfect, and "every prospect pleases." The
  thermometer in our dining-room in the afternoon now is 65°,
  and it does not fall below 60° at night. The one subject
  of conversation in the streets of Auckland to-day is the inability
  of the Bank of New Zealand to pay a dividend for the past half-year.
  It is, I think, the general opinion of our best commercial men
  that the directors acted rightly in not declaring a dividend;
  but that a dividend at the rate of twelve and a half per cent,
  ought not to have been given at the end of the previous half-year.
  An Auckland citizen, whose opinion I value most highly on such
  subjects, said to me last week, "The Bank of New Zealand
  is all right," and I have no doubt that it will in time
  recover its name for safety. It owns a great deal too much land
  in these days--in which the "earth-hunger" has temporarily
  been appeased, or has ceased to exist. Several of our Church
  Trust accounts are kept at this bank; but the Union Bank of Australia
  was Bishop Selwyn's, and some of our oldest accounts, e.g. that
  of the Melanesian Mission Trust, are still kept there. I have
  always found the authorities of these banks to be very businesslike,
  and all the officials also courteous and obliging.</p>
<p>November 1, All Saints' Day, Tuesday.--The day before the
  Synod. For some years I have arranged for a Quiet Day with the
  clergy at Synod time. On this occasion we met at eleven a.m.,
  when there was Holy Communion in the chapel. Archdeacon Maunsell
  [213/214] assisted me at the celebration. The Creed, Sanctus,
  and Gloria were led by E. After the Gloria, two interesting and
  suitable papers were read: one by Archdeacon Govett, on keeping
  up our heart in times of depression; and the other by the Rev.
  W. Beatty, on the right kind of evidence to adduce, in these
  times, of the truth of the gospel. After the service, our guests
  strolled about the grounds until dinner-time--one o'clock. Some
  of those for whose benefit the Quiet Day is specially intended--namely,
  clergy living isolated lives in distant country places--were
  unable to come, being prevented by duties which had to be attended
  to, e.g. visiting the sick and burying the dead.</p>
<p>At dinner, in the Library, our guests numbered about thirty-five.
  A small bouquet was made for each by Miss O'Grady, who came in
  the morning for the purpose.</p>
<p>November 2, Wednesday.--Synod opening. Our Diocesan Synod
  meets once a year, generally in October. It consists of the Bishop,
  the clergy holding the Bishop's licence, and laymen elected by
  the parishes and parochial districts. The opening service--celebration
  of Holy Communion--was held at S. Matthew's Church, in the city.
  As the tramway passes this church, it has been thought best to
  have the service there, so that laymen may not be deterred from
  attending it by being kept longer than is necessary from their
  several occupations. At the service to-day I was assisted by
  the following clergymen--Archdeacons Dudley, Govett, and Maunscll,
  who read the Commandments, the Epistle, and the Gospel respectively;
  and by Archdeacons Clarke and Willis, and the Rev. C. M. Nelson,
  who took part at the [214/215] administration. The offertory
  collection was for the expenses of the Synod.</p>
<p>We generally have dinner at Bishopscourt on the day of the
  Synod opening for all comers, at one o'clock.</p>
<p>Among our guests to-day was our old friend Mrs. Judd, whose
  husband, Mr. Andrew Judd, was for many years in her Majesty's
  Customs at Auckland, and previously at Russell, in the Bay of
  Islands. Mrs. Judd is one of those whose whole life is made up
  of helping others. Though not at all of a robust constitution,
  she is enabled, by her brave Christian spirit, to undergo fatigue
  for others' sake that many strong women would consider it necessary
  to avoid. Wherever she resides, she is one of the best helpers
  the clergyman has, and is a chief favourite with the younger
  people. Another of our guests on this occasion was Mr. G. Skelton,
  of Paparoa, who during many years has been the mainstay of Church
  matters in that district.</p>
<p>At three p.m. the Synod met for business in the cathedral
  Library. There was a large attendance. The lay members are quite
  the pick of our business men of Auckland and the country districts.
  If only on that account, the President's responsibility is no
  light matter; but, in addition to the fact that our lay representatives
  are of the stamp they are, they constitute for the most part
  the backbone of our diocesan organisation--men giving their time,
  or thought, or money, and in some cases giving all three of them,
  to the work of the Church. The President of the Synod may, therefore,
  rightly feel proud of his fellow-legislators, and may well exert
  himself to preside over their deliberations with the greatest
  circumspection and patience that he can [215/216] command. I
  am often quite overcome with a sense of the responsibility of
  my position when delivering my opening address to the Synod,
  and it is only by the exercise of all the will I possess that
  I save myself from breaking down.</p>
<p>At three p.m. punctually, proceedings began in the usual way.
  All stood while I said the opening prayer. I have established
  the custom of "standing" at prayer on all such occasions.
  It is a primitive custom, and is much more seemly than that which
  prevails at the meetings of many religious societies, where people
  often seem at a loss what to do--whether to kneel on the hard,
  and often dirty, floor, to loll over the back of a chair, or
  to sit in a stooping attitude. After the customary prayer for
  unity, the roll of members was called by the Rev. W. Calder,
  one of my chaplains; and the Synod was declared by me duly constituted,
  that is, not less than one-fourth of the licensed clergy and
  one-fourth of the lay representatives were present. In fact,
  two-thirds of the clergy and five-sixths of the laity answered
  to their names. In the present Synod there are sixty-two clergy
  and sixty-one laymen. My Address was longer than usual this time,
  and took me about fifty minutes to read. As it contains a summary
  of the affairs of the diocese at the present time, it is given
  at length in the Appendix. I received much assistance in preparing
  the diocesan statistics that the address contains from Miss E.
  Purchas and Mr. L. A. Robin. After the Address, which was ordered
  to be printed, secretaries and other officers were appointed
  for the session.</p>
<p>The Rev. H. S. Davies and Mr. J. D. Jackson (of [216/217]
  Onchunga) were elected secretaries. Mr. Jackson has held the
  office on many occasions, and is well acquainted with the affairs
  of the Synod; and Mr. Davies has had experience of the office
  during a former session. The Hon. Colonel Haultain was elected
  chairman of committee--an office for which he is specially fitted,
  by his experience therein during many sessions, by his thorough
  acquaintance with the affairs of the Synod, by his interest in
  all Church work, and by his patience, calmness, firmness, and
  sound good sense.</p>
<p>Most of this sitting was occupied with formal business; and
  before six p.m. the Synod adjourned to the following day, to
  enable the members to attend the Choral Festival, which was held
  in the evening at S. Matthew's Church. This festival takes place
  annually, in the evening of the day on which the Synod meets,
  in the larger Auckland churches in turn.</p>
<p>After the afternoon sitting of the Synod, we had, as usual,
  a high tea for those who had not time to go elsewhere before
  proceeding to the festival. Among our guests was Mr. H. C. Lawlor,
  of the Thames, one of our oldest and most efficient lay readers.
  It is mainly through Mr. Lawlor's zeal that our people at Tararu
  (Thames) possess a church--S. John's--in which he has conducted
  service on Sundays ever since it was built, in 1880. Our Choral
  Festival was very well managed this year. It is an opportunity
  of much benefit in several ways, if matters are rightly conducted.
  Many strangers commonly attend the service--belonging to other
  Christian bodies; and when the singing is bright and hearty,
  and the prayers are said or sung reverently, the most non-conforming
  brethren are wont to confess to [217/218] edification. The sermon,
  too, when of the right kind, may influence for good men and women
  who are very rarely seen in church. More than once I have known
  the whole service to be marred by the irreverent playing or bearing
  of the organist or the choir master. On this occasion everything
  was satisfactory. The night was fine, with brilliant moonlight.
  The church was quite-full, and well lighted. It is enough to
  say that Mr. Trimnell was at the organ, to let those who know
  his playing be sure that his accompaniment did not drown the
  singing, and that it was not a display of the organist. The prayers
  were sung with devoutness and simplicity by the Rev. G. H. S.
  Walpole; and a plain, instructive, and useful sermon was preached
  by the Rev. James Marshall, of Te Aroha. A good sermon was expected
  from Mr. Marshall; but it was doubted whether he could make himself
  heard in the more distant parts of the building, in which the
  congregation on these occasions numbers about a thousand. He
  was, however, very well heard. I was seated behind him, at a
  considerable distance, and did not lose a word, when the rustle
  of the congregation in rising from their knees had ceased.</p>
<p>The psalms, canticles, and hymns were sung in good time and
  with heartiness.</p>
<p>The clergy, preceded by the surpliced choirs of S. Mary's
  and S. Thomas', entered the church in procession. I had the pleasure
  of being accompanied by all my Archdeacons and my European chaplains.
  Many ladies of the choirs of the town parishes had "practised"
  together for the service, and all seemed to do their part well.
  At our Choral Festival the offertory collection is given to the
  Diocesan Choral Association, for the purchase [218/219] of music.
  On this occasion it amounted to about £11. I was informed
  afterwards, by one of the churchwardens, that three hundred members
  of the congregation--chiefly strangers--gave nothing! He was
  indignant at what he considered their meanness--rightly, I think.</p>
<p>November 3, Thursday.--During the session of the Synod my
  mornings are fully occupied with special work in connection with
  the session; and at one o'clock we have a semi-official dinner,
  when our guests are chiefly clergymen, whom I have an extra opportunity
  then of speaking to about their several spheres of duty.</p>
<p>Archdeacon Govett, who had been our guest since October 30,
  left us to-day; and the Rev. N. D. Boycs and Mrs. Boyes came
  to us.</p>
<p>The Synod met at four. There was a full attendance of members.
  At six p.m. I left the chair, one hour being allowed for refreshment.
  We provide tea and coffee, sandwiches, etc., for all comers during
  this interval, when we have an opportunity of speaking to many
  of our people--from the country especially--whom we do not often
  meet.</p>
<p>After seven p.m. the Synod was occupied, until its adjourning
  at ten, in considering the report of the Standing Committee.
  Much interest was shown by the members generally in the important
  matters that the report dealt with, e.g. the Home Mission, the
  work of the organising clergyman and of the Sunday-school inspector,
  and the best means of increasing the funds needed for these purposes.</p>
<p>After the adjournment we always have a short service-in the
  chapel, for those who can remain; namely, a hymn, [219/220] and
  the versicles and prayers after the Creed, ending with the Third
  Collect, and the Grace or the Blessing.</p>
<p>November 4, Friday.--The Synod sat from four p.m. to six.
  One of the resolutions unanimously passed was that the President
  be requested to communicate to the Maories of the north, through
  the Church Board, the expression of the condolence of the Synod
  for the loss of the Revs. R. Tangata, R. Paerata, H. P. te Taua,
  and Ihaka te Tai. The whole Synod stood when voting for the resolution.
  There was no evening sitting, on account of the Church Meeting.
  At six o'clock, high tea, Messrs. W. H. and A. Thorp were among
  our guests. Mr. W. H. Thorp has been for many years our lay reader
  at All Souls, Wairoa South. His father, with the family, settled
  in that district in 1842, having come from Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The annual Church Meeting was held in the Choral Hall at eight
  o'clock, its purposes being instructive and social. Two or three
  papers are commonly read at these meetings on subjects of practical
  importance to Churchmen, for the consideration of which, however,
  there is not time in Synod, and in which others besides synods-men
  are interested. The Bishop takes the chair <i>ex officio</i>
  on these occasions. Two papers were read, by the Rev. T. H. Sprott
  and the Rev. J. S. Hill respectively, the former on "The
  Church and Politics," and the latter on "Christian
  Union." Mr. Sprott's paper was too deep to be fully taken
  in at once by ordinary hearers; but it was highly appreciated
  by the audience generally, of whom many expressed a hope that
  they might have an opportunity of studying it in print. Mr. Hill's
  paper also was much appreciated, and, being on a more familiar
  [220/221] subject, was more easily comprehended. Among other
  statements made by Mr. Hill--as the result of his own experience,
  which is great, in the matter--was one to the effect that "there
  was not more brotherliness between different bodies of ' Nonconformists
  ' in the colony than there was between any one of those bodies
  and the Church of England." Discussion on the two subjects
  was invited, each speaker being limited to five minutes. The
  last who addressed the assemblage was Mr. H. G. Seth Smith, who
  never makes a speech without having something to say, and saying
  it well. On this occasion he dwelt on the fact that Christianity
  was a "life," and that the more pains men took to live
  that life the more they would be drawn into unity. His words
  were cordially received by the meeting. During the evening two
  anthems and some hymns were sung by a choir made up of volunteers
  from the Auckland churches, including Mr. Rice, who is a host
  in himself, and Mrs. Glover, whose help is always valuable and
  willingly given at such gatherings.</p>
<p>November 5, Saturday.--The annual devotional meeting of our
  Pastoral Order of the Holy Ghost was held to-day. The members
  are all in Priest's Orders, the Bishop being president. The Auckland
  branch of this Order was instituted in 1885, at the suggestion
  of the Revs. C. Bodington and G. E. Mason, who conducted a Mission
  in the diocese in that year. We began the day with a celebration
  at eight a.m. After the Creed, a short address was given by Archdeacon
  Dudley on "Living near to God"--very spiritual and
  earnest, just like himself. At eight a.m. there was breakfast
  at S. Mary's Parsonage, as there was also dinner at one p.m.,
  the [221/222] arrangements being made by Mrs. Walpole. At ten
  a.m. we met again in the chapel, when a hymn (No. 461, "Hymns,
  Ancient and Modern") was sung, and some collects were said
  by the Rev. C. M. Nelson, who afterwards read an interesting
  paper on "Meditation." Several of the clergy present
  spoke briefly on the subject. At eleven a.m. we separated for
  quiet, some strolling about the shady garden and others sitting
  in the Library, until 11.30, when we assembled again, and heard
  an excellent paper from the Rev. G. H. S. Walpole on "Some
  Lessons from our Lord's Life applied to the Work of the Ministry."
  Some of the members said a few words on the subject. We again
  separated at 12.30 p.m., returning to the chapel at two, after
  early dinner. Archdeacon Willis then read a sensible paper on
  "Some of the Things concerning which no Directions have
  been given by the Church." The subject afforded me an opportunity
  of saying what my own custom was in certain matters of "decency
  and order." Amongst other answers to direct questions, I
  stated that "under no circumstances whatever would I marry
  a divorced man or woman in the lifetime of the woman or the man
  from whom such a one had been divorced." One of the clergy
  present rightly said that "a man who had been married to
  a woman by the Church's officer and rite could not be divorced
  by the State alone," i.e. from the Church's point of view.</p>
<p>Archdeacon Willis's subject proved so interesting that it
  kept us much longer than we had intended; and as our annual business
  meeting was fixed for 3.30, we had to forego short evensong and
  an address from me--that were to have preceded the meeting. We
  parted soon after four, some to go into the country for the services
  [222/223] of the following day, and others to their work in Auckland
  or the suburbs.</p>
<p>This being Guy Fawkes Day, there is (eight p.m.) much firing
  of crackers going on, though few of the Auckland "hoodlums"
  have any clear idea of the event that they are commemorating.
  It is a sad pity to introduce such commemorations into a colony,
  where it is most desirable that the descendants of English, Scotch,
  and Irish people should be completely amalgamated--into a united
  nation. The most enthusiastic Protestant cannot, I imagine, think
  that the Roman Catholics of New Zealand are ever likely to conspire
  against their religious liberty or against the supreme authority
  of the State.</p>
<p>November 6, Sunday.--I began the day at S. Mary's, where I
  was celebrant at eight a.m., being assisted by the incumbent,
  the Rev. G. H. S. Walpole. The organ was played by Mr. G. C.
  T. Armstrong, who gives much help in this way, when the organist
  is absent. I am always disappointed when there is no singing
  at Holy Communion--the service at which, before all others, there
  should be singing, if only that the communicants may be herein
  like Him,Who with His disciples, "when they had sung a hymn,
  . . . went out into the mount of Olives." [Matt. xxvi. 30.]</p>
<p>On this occasion our daughter and our second son received
  this Sacrament for the first time.</p>
<p>This being one of the Sundays on which collections are made
  in our churches for the Home Mission of the diocese, I preached
  at two of our city churches, advocating the claims of the Mission
  on all Church-people, [223/224] viz. at S. Paul's at eleven a.m.,
  and at S. Matthew's at 6.30 p.m.</p>
<p>November 7, Monday.--The Synod sat from four to six p.m.,
  and from seven to ten p.m. At the evening-sitting the Standing
  Committee were elected. The clerical members, five in number,
  remained unchanged. Of the seven lay members elected, those not
  on the Committee of the previous year are Mr. J. Batger, Colonel
  Haultain, and Mr. E. Hesketh, all very suitable men. Mr. Batger
  is an earnest and consistent Christian man, one of our best men
  of business, and a highly respected citizen. Colonel Haultain
  and Mr. Hesketh have been already mentioned.</p>
<p>At one o'clock dinner, and at six o'clock high tea, many members
  of the Synod, and other friends, were our guests.</p>
<p>November 8, Tuesday.--At 2.30 p.m. I married Mr. A. Challinor
  Purchas, the second son of our friend the Rev. A. G. Purchas,
  to Miss E. M. G. Morse. The bridegroom is one of our young and
  rising medical men, being specially skilful in treating diseases
  of the eye. He received his medical education chiefly at Edinburgh.
  The marriage was at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is
  admirably adapted for a function; the chancel and sacrarium being
  large, with short flights of steps ascending to the Holy Table.
  There was a large congregation. Mr. Rice, the organist, gave
  us some beautiful and appropriate music before and after the
  service. The clergy--Archdeacon Dudley (incumbent), the Rev.
  A. G. Purchas, and I--met the bride, who was escorted by her
  father, at the entrance to the sacrarium, where the [224/225]
  Archdeacon and the Rev. A. G. Purchas stood on my right and left
  respectively. After the hymn, "How welcome was the call,"
  and the Preface (read by the Archdeacon), I took the first part
  of the service, including the actual marriage. While the psalm
  was being sung, the clergy and the bridal party moved up slowly
  to the Holy Table, where the remaining prayers and the blessing
  were feelingly said by the bride's father. Instead of the well-known
  concluding passages of Holy Scripture, I read one of my sermonettes,
  according to my usual custom, occupying about two minutes, and
  afterwards gave it, together with the book ("The Teacher's
  Prayer-book") used by me on the occasion, to the bride.</p>
<p>Altogether, it was one of the best conducted weddings I was
  ever at. As it was in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, it is
  unnecessary to say that all that appertained to the part of the
  officiating clergy, and of the organist and other Church officers,
  was carried out with reverence. Considering, too, who the bridegroom's
  people were, and the bride's, it would be impertinent to say
  that their bearing was as befitted the occasion. I was not in
  fear and trembling, as, unhappily, I sometimes am, lest the bridegroom
  should make a dash at the bride before leaving the Holy Table,
  and kiss her frantically, as if he was about to part with her
  for ever. It is to be hoped that this unseemly addition to the
  ritual of the Marriage Service, recently introduced in some places,
  will be discountenanced by the clergy. I am not commonly an observer
  of the details of ladies' attire, but I could not help admiring
  the simplicity and good taste in which the five bridesmaids were
  dressed. Their quaint high-peaked bonnets were very becoming,
  as, indeed, almost [225/226] anything is at the age of "sweet
  and twenty" in a modest Englishwoman.</p>
<p>The Synod sat from four p.m. to six, and from seven to ten.
  Before beginning business at seven, a most kind address was presented
  to me by Archdeacon Maunsell and Colonel Haultain, together with
  a cheque for £400, on behalf of a great many people throughout
  the diocese. [A further sum of £100 was afterwards given
  to me, through Colonel Haultain.] The Archdeacon and the colonel
  both spoke in the kindest manner before presenting the address,
  which is as follows:--</p>
<p>"To the Right Reverend William Garden Cowie, D.D., Bishop
  of Auckland.</p>
<p>"My Lord,--We, the clergy and laity of this diocese,
  desire, before the Synod closes its session, to express our best
  wishes that you and your esteemed helper in good works, Mrs.
  Cowie, may have a happy voyage to England, and a speedy return.
  From a large intercourse with our fellow-Churchmen and others,
  we can testify to the heartiness with which they recognise your
  Christian and Catholic spirit, your zeal, and your kindness and
  courtesy in dealing with us. They sec that there is scarcely
  a hamlet which you have not often visited, and for whose religious
  services you have not made provision; that our Sunday schools
  owe much to your efforts; that the Sailors' Rest and Women's
  Home, and such like institutions, are proofs of the liberality
  of your views, and of your zeal for the good of others; that
  we have much peace amongst ourselves, and that we maintain friendly
  relations with the other Christian [226/227] bodies. Although
  in common with the rest of the colony, we are suffering from
  the present great financial depression, we decided that we ought
  not to allow you to leave us without some proof of our regard.
  All the contributions of our brethren have not yet come in, but
  we cannot lose the present opportunity of addressing you, and
  beg your acceptance herewith of the amount already received.
  Signed on behalf of the clergy and laity of the diocese,</p>
<p>"B. T. DUDLEY, Archdeacon of Auckland.<br/>
  "R. MAUNSELL, Archdeacon Emeritus.<br/>
  "GEO. P. PIERCE, <br/>
  "T. M. HAULTAIN, Honorary Treasurers Testimonial Fund. <br/>
  "M. RAWLINGS, Honorary Secretary Testimonial Committee.</p>
<p>"Auckland, November 8, 1887."</p>
<p>Until a few days before, we had no notion of the kind intention
  to make this presentation. I found it very difficult--<font face="Symbol">artidakruV</font>;
  as I was--to get any words out, in acknowledgment of the address,
  especially after what the Archdeacon and the Colonel said by
  way of preface to the presentation, during which the whole Synod
  stood, with the crowd of visitors who had come for the occasion.
  [Elmsl. Med., 873.] What I succeeded in saying--being very much
  less than what I felt, which I could not trust myself to express--was:--</p>
<p>"Mrs. Cowie and I are very grateful for the kind address
  that has been presented to us, and for the generous gift with
  which it is accompanied. It is the wish and the intention of
  us both to return to our home [227/228] and our work in New Zealand
  before the end of next year; and no offer of less laborious work
  in England will induce me to remain there. You refer with approval
  to my custom of visiting all parts of the diocese. It has always
  formed a chief part of my happiness to make the acquaintance
  of our people in the thinly populated parts of the diocese, and
  to minister to them there, whether Europeans or Maories; and
  when I can no longer do so I shall think that the time has come
  for me to resign my present office, which an invalid could not
  conscientiously continue to hold. During the last four years
  I have been reminded, more than once, by the state of my health,
  that I am now the only surviving clergyman of those who went
  through the fatigue and exposure of the Lucknow campaign of 1858
  and of the Afghan campaign of 1863; and it is my duty to face
  the possibility, if not the probability, of being unable much
  longer to travel through and through the diocese, as I have hitherto
  done, and as your Bishop ought to do. It has always been my earnest
  wish to co-operate heartily with all Church workers, whatever
  their opinions might be, and whatever were the peculiarities
  of their methods of working. Whilst constantly striving for unity
  amongst ourselves, I have never cared greatly for uniformity
  in matters non-essential, whether of belief or practice. It would
  be a real grief to me if our relations with other Christian people
  were not friendly; and it will always be my endeavour that they
  may become more and more friendly and cordial, and that we may
  be able to say from our hearts, 'Grace be with all them that
  love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.' I thank you, and all
  those whom you represent, for the personal kindness [228/229]
  that you have shown to me and mine during the whole time of our
  residence among you; and I ask your prayers for us in the future.
  And one special request I will, in conclusion, make of every
  member of the Church throughout the diocese--namely, that you
  will do your utmost to provide the clergy ministering to our
  people in the country districts with at least a decent maintenance.
  May God's blessing be with you and yours."</p>
<p>November 9, Wednesday.--This being the Prince of Wales's birthday,
  which is a public holiday throughout New Zealand, the Synod did
  not meet until seven p.m. The whole evening was occupied with
  the consideration of amendments that are desirable in the Education
  Act of the colony. It was a very interesting debate; the Rev.
  J. Marshall's speech, in particular, being good and to the point.</p>
<p>I took occasion to deprecate the lax use of the words "science"
  and "supernatural," pointing out that if "science"
  is "the certain knowledge of certain things," or "organised
  knowledge," [Herbert Spencer.] there is a science of theology
  as well as a science of geology; and that it does not follow
  that a thing is "supernatural" because it is "superhuman."
  I also begged members of the Synod--some of whom seemed to think
  that S. James intended to give a complete (if not scientific)
  definition of religion in his well-known words (i. 27)--to bear
  in mind that the Greek word there rendered religion does not
  mean what we commonly intend by that word at the present time.
  "<font face="Symbol">qrhskeia</font> (cultus, exterior),"
  says Archbishop Trench, "is predominantly the ceremonial
  [229/230] service of religion, the external framework or body."
  ["New Testament Synonyms," 7th edit., p. 166.] It is
  in this sense that "pure religion and undefiled before God
  and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in
  their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."</p>
<p>The Synod gave its formal approval to the "special arrangements"
  to be made between the Bishop and .9. Mary's parish, for the
  use of the parish church as the cathedral of the diocese, in
  accordance with Title F., Canon III., 18, of the General Synod.
  [See G. S. Report for 1886, p. 131.] A magnificent site close
  to Bishopscourt was purchased by Bishop Selwyn in 1859. In reference
  to it, the late Mr. Swain-son, formerly Attorney-General, says,
  in his "New Zealand:" On the left-hand side, on the
  summit of the rise (of the Parnell hill), is an open space of
  level land, which, though not yet (1859) built upon, is not without
  interest to the prophetic eye--overlooking the town and harbour,
  and commanding an extensive view of the picturesque islands of
  the Waitemata, the Frith of the Thames, the long line of blue
  hills forming its eastern boundary, and of the islands northwards
  which give shelter to the gulf. By the provident foresight of
  Bishop Selwyn, this commanding position has been secured for
  the site of the metropolitan cathedral of New Zealand. And at
  some remote period in the far-distant future, when the projected
  cathedral shall have become a venerable pile, it will be a matter
  of no little interest to its then ministers (should the tradition
  be so long preserved) to read how in the <i>dark</i> or early
  ages of New Zealand, Anno Domini 1843, its founder, the first
  Bishop of New Zealand, returning from a walking visitation of
  [230/231] more than a thousand miles, attended by a faithful
  companion of a then, it may be, extinct race, the bearer of his
  gown and cassock, the only remaining articles of value he had
  left--his shoes worn out and tied to his instep by a leaf of
  native flax, travel worn, but not weary--once more found himself
  on this favoured spot, arrested for a moment by the noble prospect
  presented to his bodily eye, and cheered by the prophetic vision
  of a long line of successors, Bishops of New Zealand, traversing
  the same spot, better clad and less ragged than himself."
  [Swainson's "New Zealand," p. 219.]</p>
<p>Glad as I should be to have a cathedral, if one could now
  be placed by some fairy on Bishop Selwyn's site, yet without
  any endowment for its maintenance, and separated only by a road
  from S. Mary's parish church, it would be something like a "white
  elephant;" and the new parish church will for many years
  to come serve the principal purposes of a cathedral. The trustees
  of the cathedral estate should, as soon as possible, avail themselves
  of their power to lease those parts of the land which are not
  required for the cathedral site, and so help to form a fund for
  the building of a cathedral and for its endowment. The General
  Synod should, I think, at its next meeting, provide for the appointment
  of Honorary Canons.</p>
<p>Our Synod in 1886 appointed a committee to prepare a Digest
  of the Diocesan Statutes in the form of Canons. The work was
  carefully and thoroughly done, and was formally adopted by the
  Synod to-day. The committee informed the Synod that the Digest
  was mainly the work of the Rev. C. M. Nelson and Mr. H. G. Seth
  [231/232] Smith, whose painstaking and accuracy specially qualified
  them for so important an undertaking.</p>
<p>November 11, Friday.--In the afternoon, I had a conference
  with Archdeacon Dudley and the examining chaplains on the advisability
  of admitting some of our deacons to Priest's Orders, and one
  of our college students to Deacon's Orders, before my departure
  for England in January. The deacons working in large country
  districts--in some cases four hundred square miles or more in
  extent--are at a great disadvantage, in not being able to administer
  the Holy Communion to their people, who go away to other ministers
  for that Sacrament. With many congregations to visit--in some
  cases four, and even five, on a Sunday--it is impossible for
  some of the young clergy to prepare all their subjects for the
  Priest's Orders Examination, even in three or four years; and
  it is not often that a priest can leave a town church on Sunday
  to administer the Sacrament in a deacon's district.</p>
<p>The whole of the evening was spent by the Synod in considering
  whether or not it was desirable that the Education Act of the
  colony should be altered, so as to allow grants in aid to be
  made to denominational and other schools, in which the "secular"
  teaching came up to the requirements of the educational authorities.
  It was conclusively demonstrated, as the Rev. J. Marshall pointed
  out, from statements made by three of the speakers, members of
  the Auckland Board of Education, in opposition to the proposed
  alteration, that under the present Act religious instruction
  could not be adequately given, by clergymen and others visiting
  the schools for the purpose, before or after school hours--the
  only times [232/233] at which such instruction is now permitted
  to be given. One speaker suggested that the present number of
  hours for secular teaching might be shortened on one or more
  days of the week, so as to allow of religious instruction being
  given on those days. It had, however, been proposed, as Mr. Upton
  said, to add to the present curriculum in primary schools some
  elementary teaching of natural science, but it was impossible
  to make this addition without omitting other instruction which
  was considered essential. How, then, could time be found for
  religious instruction? Assuredly, no time could be found for
  it under the present system. Q.E.D.</p>
<p>It was resolved, by a large majority of clerical members,
  and a small majority of lay members, that the proposed amendment
  of the Education Act was desirable.</p>
<p>The Synod was prorogued this evening, after an interesting
  session.</p>
<p>November 12, Saturday.--I was to have gone to Waiaku, but
  only got as far as Pukekohe (thirty miles), whence I returned
  to Auckland in the afternoon. It was a day of pouring rain; and,
  as I was not quite well, I thought I had better not ride thirteen
  or fourteen miles through the wet, and over muddy and slippery
  unmetalled roads. It was a great disappointment to me, as I have
  a horror of departing from an engagement with any of our congregations,
  especially those in the country. One of our senior clergy said
  to me not long since, "You have brought the clergy to expect
  that the Bishop can never be ill and incapacitated for duty."</p>
<p>November 14, Monday.--In the evening, we went to the Auckland
  Institute, where an interesting paper was read by Mr. S. Percy
  Smith, on the geology of the [233/234] Kermadec Islands, situated
  about six hundred miles to the north-east of Auckland, and annexed
  by Great Britain on August 17 of this year. The islands, of which
  Sunday Island is the largest, are of volcanic foundation, and
  are in the line of fissure passing through Tarawera (where the
  great eruption was in 1886) and White Island. We were not able
  to remain to hear the other papers. The affairs of the Institute
  are managed by a president and council, elected by the subscribers.
  The president this year is Professor Thomas, of the Auckland
  University College; and the secretary (a permanent officer) is
  Mr. F. Cheeseman, a distinguished botanist. The chief endowment
  of the Institute is a bequest from the late Mr. E. Costley, of
  £12,150. It possesses a good museum, and has for the present
  the charge of some valuable pictures given to the Auckland people
  by the late Mr. Mackelvie, who retired some years ago from the
  firm of Brown, Campbell, and Co., Auckland merchants, with a
  considerable sum of money. November 15, Tuesday.--Auckland is
  now looking its best. Every garden at all cared for is full of
  flowers, especially roses. Below our principal windows there
  is an orange tree covered with blossom, which quite scents all
  the rooms on that side of the house. The morning and afternoon
  were occupied with committee meetings. In the evening, we went
  to Waitakerei, about twenty miles north-west of Auckland, to
  get a few hours of rest and retirement. Our horses were taken
  out by our son Edmund to the Waitakerei station on the Helensville
  railway, whence we rode about a mile, up a steep and muddy hill,
  to a small house owned by Mr. Dilworth, who had kindly placed
  it at our service. The house is [234/235] charmingly situated
  on the top of a range overlooking an extensive and undulating
  country, covered with fern. Between the house and the west coast
  (about five miles) there are extensive forests, which we would
  have explored, but for the rain, which continued all the following
  morning, and made the tracks too wet and slippery for travelling.
  In time these ranges will no doubt be the resort of numbers of
  people from Auckland and all parts of the colony, as the scenery
  is beautiful, and the air very invigorating, from the height
  of the hills and the prevalence of bracing south-west winds.</p>
<p>November 16.--We read and wrote all the morning, enjoying
  greatly the retirement and the perfect stillness of Mr. Dilworth's
  retreat. In the afternoon, the rain ceased for an hour or two,
  and we strolled to the top of a hill behind the house, where
  we came to the farm of Mr. Smyth, grandly situated. From the
  verandah of his house we looked down through the forest to the
  sea on the west coast; on the south, at a distance of some miles,
  we saw the celebrated waterfall of the district; and in the distance,
  to the east, we saw the spire of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
  and other landmarks of the city of Auckland. Mr. Smyth was not
  at home; but we were kindly received by his sister, Mrs. Carswell,
  who, in speaking of the want of charity shown by many Christians
  in their treatment of others, attributed this want (rightly,
  as I think) to their lack of humility, referring to Augustine's
  saying on the subject. This family, and that of Mr. Edwards,
  who live in Mr. Dilworth's house, are Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>Colonel W. C. Lyon, formerly of the Coldstream Guards and
  the 92nd Highlanders, died to-day suddenly [235/236] in his bath,
  of heart disease. He was a soldierlike man, and a thorough gentleman.
  He came to New Zealand in 1858, and I first met him in the Waikato
  district in 1870, when he was in command of the armed constabulary
  of that district. He had for many years been one of our licensed
  lay readers, first at Cambridge and afterwards in Auckland, where
  he helped regularly at the Sunday services of the Old People's
  Refuge.</p>
<p>November 19, Saturday,--After a very busy morning, of teaching
  our children Greek and Latin, and of official writing, I married
  Professor Thomas, of our Auckland University College, to Miss
  Emily Russell, at S. Andrew's, Epsom. It was a beautiful day,
  and there was a large gathering at the church. The Rev. P. S.
  Smallfield, clergyman of the district, assisted. I had only time
  to call at the house of the bride's father for a few minutes,
  on my way from the church to the wharf, to catch the Thames steamer,
  <i>Rotomahana</i>. I reached the Thames at 9.15 p.m., and became
  the guest of Dr. and Mrs. Payne.</p>
<p>November 20.--A perfect day at the Thames. My first service
  was at Parawai, at 10.30 a.m., when I preached to the Maori congregation
  at their Church of the Holy Trinity,} and held a Confirmation.
  The prayers were said by the Rev. W. Turipona, clergyman of the
  district. He has inherited the sturdy physique of his mother,
  a chieftainess, who is reported to have swum across the Tamaki
  river, two months before her son's birth, to escape from the
  enemies of her tribe, who were bent on exterminating their foes.
  William and Rebecca Turipona have had eleven children, all of
  whom died in [236/237] childhood or youth. The last surviving
  son, H. T. te Wararahi, was a young man of great promise, having
  been educated in Auckland, at the High School; but at the age
  of twenty, like his brothers and sisters, he died of consumption,
  in 1876. The lessons were read by Nikorima Poutotara, a Chief
  of high character, who occasionally acts as lay reader. He has
  a strong voice and clear enunciation. After the service, the
  Church officers asked me to accept the offerings of the congregation,
  to help to pay the expenses of my intended visit to England.
  I thanked them for their consideration, but requested them to
  add the sum to their Minister's Stipend Fund, which they consented
  to do.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I preached at S. John's, Tararu, where the
  congregation has been ministered to for twenty years by Mr. H.
  C. Lawlor, a pensioner of the Colonial Government and a member
  of the Diocesan Synod. Seven years ago the little church was
  built, chiefly as the result of Mr. Lawlor's zeal. He is one
  of the senior lay readers of the diocese, and said the prayers
  and read the Lessons on this occasion. The harmonium was played
  by Miss Wolff, whose father is the manager of one of the mine
  batteries. Mr. Lawlor told me the following interesting story:--The
  late Bishop Selwyn was conferring with a Church Committee, not
  far from Auckland, on the subject of paying punctually the clergyman's
  stipend, which had fallen into arrear, as too often happens,
  chiefly for want of suitable collectors to ask heads of families
  periodically for their promised contributions. The Bishop seems
  to have administered a gentle reproof to the Church Committee
  for their slackness. In any case, one of them, a fine old soldier,
  [237/238] stood up, and said to the Bishop, "My Lord, excuse
  my giving you an answer from my own experience. I am a keeper
  of cows, and as long as they are milked regularly night and morning
  they give a good supply of milk; but if they are left to themselves
  for a few days, no amount of milking will bring anything into
  the pail. It is the collectors who are to blame. If they came
  to me and others on the days when our pensions are paid, we would
  readily give all that could be fairly expected of us." The
  Bishop was delighted with this answer, and never afterwards failed
  to ask for the old soldier when he visited that settlement.</p>
<p>In the evening, I held a Confirmation, and preached at S.
  George's. The church was quite full, the congregation numbering
  nearly a thousand. The arrangements of the clergyman, the Rev.
  F. G. Evans, were admirable. The women and girl candidates all
  wore white muslin caps made after one simple pattern by the hands
  of Mrs. Evans. The results, direct and indirect, of this good
  work were excellent. Occasion for display was removed, if it
  were necessary; distinctions of social status were non-apparent;
  and all the recipients of Mrs. Evans's handiwork possessed a
  token of her interest in themselves personally. The psalms and
  hymns were heartily sung to Mr. Trewheeler's good accompaniment;
  the organ being a gift from Captain Wildman, of the Naval Volunteers,
  who was prevented by ill health from being present. Captain Wildman
  is an M.A. of the University of Oxford. At one time, when he
  was minister's warden at S. Georges, the people's warden also
  was an M.A., of Cambridge. The Lessons were read by Mr. J. E.
  Coney, the chief postmaster, in a strong, clear voice, with intelligence
  and reverence. I do not think I ever heard the Bible better read
  to the congregation by a lay reader. The anthem was "As
  pants the hart," of which the solo part was sung sweetly
  and simply by Mr. Coney's daughter, Mrs. Haultain. Anthems when
  sung as this one was, and when not too long, cannot rightly be
  called undevotional. They are often specially objected to, as
  not being congregational, by Nonconformists; who seem to forget
  that, in their own houses of prayers, very little of the service
  is congregational, even the prayers--for the most part--being
  solos, and long ones, taken by the minister. I took for my text
  the following words from the first Lesson:--"Be strong,
  all ye people of the land, saith the Lord; and work." As
  it was the anniversary of the loss of the Crag Piquet by the------Regiment,
  in the Umbeyla campaign of 1863 (against the Afghan tribes),
  I illustrated the words "Be strong" by the conduct
  of Assistant-Surgeon Pile on that occasion. [I joined this force
  as chaplain in the end of November, 1863.] When those who were
  near him took to flight on the approach of the vociferating Afghans,
  Pile, with a few others, refused to quit their post, and were
  cut down. Afterwards, when peace was made, some of the Afghan
  leaders who had driven our men out of the Piquet, inquired who
  the brave young officer (describing Pile) was who "would
  not move." "We were very sorry to kill him," they
  said; "but we were obliged to do so, as he would not move.</p>
<p>The offertory collection to-night, without any special appeal,
  amounted to £10 6<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. The yield of gold
  from this district has been on the increase lately. About [239/240]
  six thousand ounces have, I hear, been obtained, by "tributors"
  chiefly, during the past month.</p>
<p>November 21, Monday.--I left the Thames at eight a.m. for
  Paeroa, about twenty-two miles up the Thames valley, by a coach
  with four horses. The vehicle was American, of strong and light
  structure, with leather springs, having three inside benches,
  which Mr. M. Lush and I had to ourselves--fortunately, for the
  road was very rough, with stone and ruts, and the jolting was
  great. At Puriri (about eight miles from the Thames), where the
  coach stopped for a few minutes, I was met by Mrs. Poutotara,
  the wife of Nikorima, mentioned above. Her maiden name was Katherine
  Hobson te Karari, and she was brought up, as an adopted daughter,
  by Lady Martin; her father, the Rev. Philemon te Karari, having
  been drowned in crossing the Kaipara in 1864. Mrs. Poutotara
  speaks English without any foreign accent, and has a cultivated
  voice. The Thames valley is a fine pastoral country, bordered
  on the east by high hills. At Hikutaia (about twelve miles from
  the Thames gold-field) a road turns off to the east, leading
  to the new gold-field, Marototo, of which there are at present
  great expectations.</p>
<p>The coach reached Paeroa about noon, when I was transferred
  to another conveyance, with three horses, driven by a boy of
  fourteen years, and was put down, about two miles further on,
  at Mr. Alfred Thorp's gate, on the road to Te Aroha. Mr. Thorp
  is the synodsman for this district, and a brother of our old
  friend, Mr. W. H. Thorp, of Wairoa South. Close to Mr. Thorp's
  house, and on his land, is a small cottage in which the great
  chief of the district, Moananui, once lived, and [238/239] which
  has been left uninhabited since his death. I was here in January,
  1873, having ridden from the Thames, by a rough track, before
  there was any formed road in the district. The neighbourhood
  of Mr. Thorp's house has changed so much in appearance since
  those days, that I did not at first recognise Te Moananui's cottage,
  on the bank of the Ohinemuri river. A few yards from the cottage
  stands a small wooden building, now used as a storehouse, but
  built by Moananui for a church in 1873. In the month of January
  of that year I came here, at the invitation of Moananui, to open
  the church, being assured by him that the site of the building
  would be duly conveyed to trustees appointed by the Synod. Subsequently
  it was proved that Moananui had no title to the land, which was
  eventually sold--and the church with it--to the present proprietor,
  Mr. A. Thorp. An important moral is to be drawn from this history--that
  there should be no departure, if possible, from the rule that
  the church site should be conveyed to the Synod before the church
  is formally opened by the Bishop.</p>
<p>In the evening, at seven, there was service in the public
  hall of the settlement, the room having been tastefully decorated
  with flowers and ferns by Mrs. Thorn. Part of Evening Prayer
  was said by the Rev. W. Katterns, whose head-quarters are at
  Katikati, nearly thirty miles distant. The hymns were heartily
  sung, to a harmonium accompaniment, played by Mr. Rhodes. After
  the Third Collect, several persons received the rite of Confirmation.
  In these country districts, it requires zeal and perseverance
  on the part of the clergyman to induce the young people to prepare
  for the Laying on of Hands. Mr. Katterns, for instance, has to
  ride sixty [241/242] miles (going and returning) to see the young
  people of Paeroa, who are scattered over a large district, and
  cannot easily be assembled in class for instruction; and unfriendly
  influences are often brought to bear to deter suitable persons
  from becoming candidates for Confirmation.</p>
<p>November 22, Tuesday.--Mr. Katterns and I left Paeroa about
  nine a.m. on horsebeck for Owharoa, about eight miles distant,
  on the Ohinernuri river. The road was very interesting, through
  beautiful forest, and along the right bank of the river, which
  in many places pours down with a refreshing sound through collections
  of boulders. We crossed many sparkling mountain streams, and
  the ti-tree on both sides of the road was laden with beautiful
  white blossom. At Owharoa a good deal of gold has been obtained
  during the last ten years; but at the present time there are
  only about twenty men employed in the one mine now being worked.
  Mr. R. Reid, a Presbyterian from the north of Ireland, was our
  host. He told me that there was no difficulty in earning a livelihood
  and a little pocket-money as well throughout the district, in
  the case of honest, industrious, and healthy men. I heard here
  the old story of people at gold diggings--of men who had without
  much labour obtained large sums of money, and spent it all on
  debauchery, benefiting neither themselves nor others by their
  suddenly acquired wealth. The usual course with such people is--to
  find themselves unexpectedly rich; to decline to help any good
  cause with their money; to squander it all on animal gratifications;
  to become penniless, healthless, and helpless. They are living
  illustrations of the words of an Anglican Bishop, "If [242/243]
  men will not apportion their charities to their means, they may
  expect God to apportion their means to their charities."</p>
<p>At two o'clock there was service in the little school building
  near Mr. Reid's house. The congregation represented all the settlements
  within ten miles of Owharoa, namely, Mackaytown, Waitckauri,
  and Waihi. Mr. Katterns said part of Evening Prayer, and I preached.
  Afterwards the Laying on of Hands was administered to a goodly
  number of persons, of whom the majority were married people.</p>
<p>We set out again at 4.15 p.m. for Katikati. Though it rained
  most of the way, the ride was enjoyable, but for my having to
  carry omnia mea vieaim, viz. a bag attached tp the side of my
  saddle behind, and holster bags in front. The first part of our
  journey was along the right bank of the beautiful Ohinemuri river;
  then we crossed the Waihi plains--about seven miles; and the
  last three miles were through the wild Katikati gorge, in which
  we crossed a rapid sparkling stream many times. When first I
  travelled this way, there was only a Maori track, and the stream
  had to be forded; but now there is a capital road (unmetalled),
  and all the crossings are bridged. We reached Athenree, Captain
  Hugh Stewart's estate, about 7.30, just as it was getting dark,
  after riding about fifteen miles from Owharoa. Captain Stewart
  was formerly in the Royal Artillery, and came to New Zealand
  about nine years ago. Mrs. Stewart is a pattern settler's wife,
  making the best of everything, and not wasting time and energy
  on deploring the want of comforts that were once hers in Europe.
  The family came to New Zealand primarily for the benefit of their
  [243/244] son's health; and in this district they enjoy good
  health in a perfect climate, and can obtain all the necessaries
  of life at small cost.</p>
<p>Good honey is so abundant here that there is no sale for it.
  Twopence a pound would be considered a fail-price, but it is
  not to be got. The Katikati district extends about ten miles,
  from the Gorge to the Uretara stream, where the township is situated.</p>
<p>November 23, Wednesday,--Captain Stewart drove me in his home-made
  four-wheeled buggy to the Katikati township, near which is the
  farm of the Rev. W. Katterns, the clergyman of the district,
  whose guest I became. On our way we passed several small farms,
  separated by hundreds of acres of fern, and of ti-tree now in
  full bloom.</p>
<p>The Katikati settlement was first formed in 1875, by a number
  of immigrants who came from Ireland in the ship <i>Carisbrook
  Castle</i>. Many of them brought with them a little money, and
  some of them were what would be called "well-to-do."
  A second party from Ireland arrived in 1878. Among those who
  bought larger blocks of land were Captain Mervyn Stewart, the
  father of Captain Hugh Stewart, Major-General J. F. Stoddard,
  and Major-General T. H. Stoddard, retired officers of the Indian
  Army, the Rev. W. Mulgan (now Incumbent of Onehunga), and the
  Rev. W. Johnston, B.A., formerly an honorary canon in Ireland,
  and before that an officer in an Infantry regiment. To this district,
  in the early days, a good many young men came as "cadets,"
  to learn farming on the larger estates. It is generally a great
  mistake to send from England to such districts young men whose
  idle disposition prevents their doing [244/245] anything good
  in their native land. I have heard of many such men in different
  parts of the diocese going from bad to worse, until they have
  become completely demoralised by idleness and drinking. Their
  friends, it has been said, hope that these ne'er-do-weels may
  be "better off" in a distant colony; but they know
  that, in any case, they will be "further off," which
  is the chief end to be attained. <i>Qui trans mare currunt, coelum
  non animum mutant</i>. As a rule, the idle at home will be idle
  still in a colony, and the vicious, vicious still, or even more
  so, when all restraints of home, family, and society are discontinued.
  Besides, the persons to whom such cadets are sent in New Zealand
  are often the most unfit to whom wayward sons could be entrusted
  by their parents. I have known young men to be sent to settlers
  whose example and general influence were of the worst--socially,
  morally, and religiously. In such cases, premiums have been paid
  by fathers for the demoralisation and the ruin of their children.</p>
<p>Of those who are chargeable with injuring a young colony,
  few are more guilty of pernicious action than such parents. They
  rid themselves of some of the evil effects of the neglect or
  mismanagement of their families, by inflicting these educational
  failures on countries like Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In the evening, I preached at S. Patrick's, one of the churches
  built after the designs of the Rev. Philip Walsh. There was a
  large congregation, it being a moonlight night and the roads
  being dry. Part of Evening Prayer was said by Mr. Katterns. After
  the Third Collect, seventeen persons were confirmed; and about
  a third of the congregation remained for Holy [245/246] Communion.
  The special Lesson was read by Mr. T. G. Anderson, the lay reader,
  one of whose daughters was among those confirmed, and another
  played the harmonium. Mr. Anderson, with his family, came to
  the district from England about two years ago. They are a great
  acquisition to Katikati in every way, doing all they can to help
  to maintain a high tone among the young people. Keeping open
  house, and being friendly to all, the influence for good that
  they are able to exercise is great. My three days in Mr. Katterns'
  district have been pleasant and encouraging. Everywhere I have
  seen tokens of his energy and faithfulness, especially in the
  number of persons whom he has prepared for Confirmation. The
  administration of that rite, when the candidates have been carefully
  prepared, is one of the most cheering parts of a Bishop's work.
  The opportunities that a parish priest has at such times for
  giving definite Christian teaching to individuals, and of influencing
  their after-lives, are incalculable, and such as rarely recur.</p>
<p>The people of Mr. Katterns' extensive and sparsely inhabited
  district are not able to supply him with a maintenance; but some
  of his congregation do their best in the matter, and the Colonial
  and Continental Church Society supplement the offerings of the
  people with an annual grant of £50.</p>
<p>November 24, Thursday.--I crossed the range of hills situated
  between the coast and the Thames (Waihou) river, through a gorge
  about twelve hundred feet above the sea, to Te Aroha, where I
  became the guest of the Rev. J. Marshall. On this ride (of about
  eighteen miles) I was escorted part of the way by Mr. Katterns'
  son, [246/247] Mr. C. Gledstanes, and Mr. II. M. A. Major, who
  carried my bag for me on the front of his saddle. The track over
  the hill was through dense forest, and was in parts very muddy
  and slippery, as heavy showers had been falling for some hours.
  It was also very narrow in some places, making it wise to dismount
  and lead the horses. E. rode over this hill with me in 1885.
  The track was not as good then as it is now. We were warned on
  that occasion to dismount at a certain point, where the track
  was only a narrow ledge cut out of the face of a rock, with a
  precipice of hundreds of feet on one side. It was not, however,
  easy to get off our horses in such a place; and, as neither horses
  nor riders were timid, we rode safely along the ledge. We afterwards
  heard a good story in connection with this part of the-track,
  illustrative of the "subjection of women." A Waikato
  settler and his wife, we were told, were on their way across
  the mountain; the lady riding in front, and passing over the
  narrow ledge without making anything of it. When the husband
  reached the critical point, he stopped, and called out to the
  lady, "It is not safe to go along that place; you must come
  back, my dear." The obedient wife accordingly recrossed
  the narrow ledge, and they returned to Te Aroha. I cannot vouch
  for the truth of this story, but it was told to us with all particulars--of
  names and date.</p>
<p>The ride to-day was very enjoyable, notwithstanding the mountain
  mist and heavy showers that we encountered. Like New Zealand
  youths, two of my young companions had not brought overcoats,
  preferring light travelling to protection from the rain. "Hal"
  Major, a cheery lad of sixteen years, was the life of the party,
  [247/248] finding fresh subjects for merriment in deeper mud,
  narrower tracks, and more drenching showers. The tree-ferns and
  nikau-palms, growing in luxuriance on the hillsides, were worth
  travelling far to see; and nothing could exceed in wild beauty
  the mountain torrents, dashing over the rocks and under the rustic
  bridges of our winding track. A solemn stillness reigned throughout
  the forest the greater part of our journey, broken now and then
  by the rich, quaint notes of the tui. We reached the summit of
  the gorge about half-past eleven, when we gave our horses a short
  rest. As there was plenty of grass and clover on the spot, they
  were refreshed for the descent to the plain towards the west.
  The view from our halting-place was very extensive on both sides;
  behind us Tauranga Harbour, seeming quite close, with the sea
  beyond, and in front the Waihou (Thames) river, and the Piako
  plains stretching away to the Waikato. For bracing air, an exhilarating
  ride, an extensive view, and lovely bush scenery, an excursion
  to the top of this pass (about twelve hundred feet) may be recommended
  as one that will not be disappointing, especially when followed,
  as in my case, by a hot bath at the Te Aroha springs.</p>
<p>On reaching the foot of the hills on the Te Aroha side--about
  one o'clock--I bade farewell to my escort, who halted to rest
  their horses before returning home on a mound covered with good
  grass and clover; and I continued my journey (about six miles)
  to Mr. Marshall's alone, carrying <i>omnia mea mecum</i> on my
  saddle.</p>
<p>There were very few visitors staying at the Te Aroha hotels,
  chiefly in consequence of the prevailing [248/249] commercial
  depression, which is adverse to travelling and hotel expenses.</p>
<p>November 25.--I went on to Cambridge (thirty-nine miles) by
  train, and became the guest of Archdeacon Willis at S. Andrew's.
  A day of strong wind from the south-west, and hot sun; and my
  journey was a great contrast with yesterday's--over the mountain;
  the mud of the bush track being exchanged for driving clouds
  of "mud's thirsty brother" of the plains. The church,
  as an archdeacon's church should be, is a pattern to the archdeaconry,
  externally and internally, of perfect order. The grounds are
  tastefully planted with beautiful trees, flowering shrubs, arums,
  and other plants. The porch contains various "notices"
  of interest to the parishioners, especially the monthly statement
  of receipts and expenditure; and the vestry is quite a sight,
  with the beautiful altar-cloth spread out on one of the walls
  and carefully protected, and with all the frames for decorations
  and divers festival appurtenances neatly arranged, and ready
  for use, on the others. I searched for a cobweb, but could find
  none, nor even dust. Such being the decency and order of the
  grounds and of the adjuncts of the building, it is unnecessary
  to say that the chancel and the body of the church were faultlessly
  neat and clean; the dark blinds being carefully drawn down, to
  prevent the fading of all colours by reason of the brilliant
  sunshine.</p>
<p>November 27, Sunday.--My first service was at S. Andrew's
  at eleven a.m. The Archdeacon said prayers, and I preached and
  administered the Laying on of Hands. There was a large congregation.
  The harmonium was played by Mrs. Chitty, whose husband is one
  of my [249/250] oldest New Zealand acquaintances, and a relative
  of Nisi Prius Chitty. After service, at the suggestion of friends,
  I stood at the porch door, and shook hands with nearly all the
  congregation, as they left the building.</p>
<p>Archdeacon Willis and his wife wisely have their children
  with them at all meals, as soon as they are old enough to sit
  at the table with safety to themselves and others. Parents who
  relegate their children to the nursery at these times make a
  serious mistake, especially in cases where either of them sees
  little of the children during the day. A great deal of teaching,
  of various kinds, may be given, directly and indirectly, during
  the time of meals; besides the advantage that children derive
  from seeing and hearing their parents' guests in a well-ordered
  household. It is sometimes objected to this custom that children
  are liable to hear things and persons discussed at meal-times
  in a manner that is not beneficial to juvenile minds; but surely
  the presence of children may act as a wholesome restraint on
  their elders, especially in the matter of speaking about neighbours
  and acquaintances.</p>
<p>At 1.45 p.m. I left Cambridge for Hautapu (about seven miles),
  with my oldest Waikato friend, Mr. James Hume, manager of the
  Bank of New Zealand at Hamilton, who brought his buggy for me.
  In early days I used to ride to and from Cambridge by this road.
  It is now greatly altered in appearance by the luxuriant growth
  of the hawthorn hedges and <i>insignis </i>pines and <i>macrocarpa
  </i>cypresses. A good deal of wheat is now grown in the district.
  The afternoon service at S. Stephens, Hautapu, was at three o'clock.
  At the church [250/251] I met Colonel Forbes, one of the Hamilton
  lay readers, who had driven over to help me. He said the prayers
  and read the Lessons, in a clear cultured voice, with understanding
  and reverence. After the service Mr. Hume took me on to Hamilton,
  where I became the guest of my kind friend Mrs. Gwynne. At the
  evening service at S. Peter's, Hamilton, I preached and held
  a Confirmation; Evening Prayer being said by the Rev. R. O'C.
  Biggs, the clergyman of the district. The Lessons were read by
  Mr. Swarbrick, one of the lay readers. The service was hearty
  and reverent, as it always is at S. Peter's. Miss Newell is the
  efficient organist. Among the choir is Mrs. Templer, wife of
  the energetic choir-master. She was for many years a member of
  the Auckland Choral Society, when Miss Cherie Connell. The psalms
  were so well sung that I was able to follow easily without a
  book.</p>
<p>December 1, Thursday.--In the evening, our Auckland Sailors'
  Home f was opened by me. The building is conveniently situated,
  and is in every respect well suited for its purpose. There was
  a large gathering of sailors and others at the opening, the Mission
  Hall being £owded. At the request of the Council I made
  a short statement of the history and the purposes of the Home,
  emphasising the fact that it would never be lawful to (1) exclude
  religious teaching, or to (2) exclude sailors on account of their
  particular religious belief. I have my fears concerning the latter
  principle; because the Council cannot appoint an educated Professor
  of Theology, and unlearned religious teachers are, in proportion
  to their ignorance, apt to assume for themselves the infallibility
  [251/252] that they deny to any ecclesiastical authority, and,
  in proportion to their earnestness, to proselytise whenever they
  can. After my address on this occasion, others were given by
  the Rev. J. S. Hill, Mr. F. Battley, Mr. T. Buddie, and Mr. F.
  G. Ewington. Mr. Battley is one of our principal financiers,
  and has given our Council valuable assistance, especially in
  connection with the accounts of the Home. He is a member of the
  Baptist communion, but is liberal-minded, a practical philanthropist,
  and a pleasant coadjutor. Mr. T. Buddie is the son of a late
  respected Wesleyan minister, and is himself a mainstay of that
  denomination. He is a partner in the firm of Whitaker and Russell,
  among the chief lawyers of Auckland, and, like Mr. Battley, has
  given the Council the benefit of his professional knowledge.
  Mr. Buddie, too, is a practical philanthropist and a pleasant
  coadjutor. The Young Men's Christian Association is indebted
  to him, next to Archdeacon Maunsell, for their new building,
  and for the good work that has been, and is being, done by that
  institution.</p>
<p>I was obliged to leave the meeting early in the evening, and
  the chair was then taken by Captain Hugh Anderson, the vice-president,
  who has taken great interest in the Sailors' Rest and the Sailors'
  Home from their beginning, and has given much time and thought
  to their affairs. He is an Aberdonian and a Presbyterian, and
  a man of sound judgment and a kind heart, and inspires confidence
  in all who have to do with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Ewington was the first secretary of the Sailors' Rest,
  as he has been of other philanthropic institutions in Auckland.
  His life exemplifies the maxim of S. Paul--"Be not weary
  in well-doing." There is no one else [252/253] in the diocese
  to whom I have so often applied for help in helping others as
  to him; and he has never, by word or manner, given me a hint
  to go elsewhere for assistance. Among "the great unpaid"
  benefactors of our community I should bracket Mr. Ewington with
  others as first in the first class. His knowledge of the circumstances
  of our people, and his sympathy with young men beginning the
  world, have enabled him to give a helping hand to hundreds of
  deserving persons, especially among immigrants from the old country.</p>
<p>Our present secretary of the Home is the Hon. Colonel Haultain,
  of whom mention has already been made. He is also one of those
  to be bracketed first in the first class of "the great unpaid"
  benefactors of the Auckland community. <i>O si sic omnes!</i>
  Much good work at the Rest and Home has been done by ladies,
  especially Mrs. Moore and Miss A. Maunsell. Mrs. Moore is an
  American by birth, and is the wife of one of our medical men,
  a homceopathist, Dr. J. Murray Moore, who is an active member
  of the Council, and a sympathetic helper in many of our philanthropic
  institutions. The late Mr. Swainson, formerly Attorney-General
  of New Zealand, used to say of Mrs. Moore, "I have known
  ladies who devoted their lives to works of charity, and I have
  known other ladies who dressed well and with unerring good taste;
  but Mrs. Murray Moore is the first I have known to combine these
  two talents."</p>
<p>Miss Agnes Maunsell is a daughter of Archdeacon Maunsell,
  the translator of the Bible into Maori. Her voice, like that
  of her sister, Mrs. A. Coates, is well known to Auckland people
  for its sweetness and power, [253/254] and for its use in aiding
  Christian causes, especially when exerted, as was the Psalmist's,
  who said, "I will sing and give praise with the best member
  I have." [Ps. cviii. I.]</p>
<p>December 2, Friday.--I went to the Northern Wairoa district,
  travelling to Helensville (thirty-four miles) by railway, and
  thence by a small steamer, the <i>Minnie Casey</i>, of seventy-four
  tons, about eighty miles to Dargaville, a settlement so named
  from its founder and proprietor, Mr. J. M. Dargaville, formerly
  a member of the House of Representatives. The route of the <i>Minnie
  Casey </i>is through the Kaipara Waters--an inland sea, which
  pours in and out at the Heads on the west coast, where there
  is a formidable bar. Crossing the Heads in a small steamer when
  the wind is blowing in from the west, as it was to-day, is not
  at all pleasant to bad sailors, as were some of my fellow-passengers
  on this occasion. Our whole passage was against the tide and
  wind, and consequently we did not reach Dargaville until 9.30
  p.m.; but the moon was at the full, and towards night the wind
  lulled a little, and travelling was not unpleasant. I was met
  at the wharf by Mr. Dargaville and his son Frank, who escorted
  me to "the house" of the settlement, where Mrs. Dargaville's
  hospitalities were specially acceptable after a long and stormy
  passage from Helensville. Most of the family were out at a musical
  and dramatic entertainment, given by the Roman Catholic priest
  of the district and his friends, for the benefit of the building
  fund of a new Roman church at Te Kopuru. Mr. Dargaville used
  to be considered a pillar, or at all events a buttress, of the
  Orange cause in Auckland. From this fact it may be inferred,
  as is happily [254/255] the case, that in New Zealand the mutual
  bitterness between Romanists and other Christians--too common
  among the Irish at home--is very considerably toned down. I once
  received a call from a Roman Catholic lady who was collecting
  subscriptions for the building of a cathedral in Auckland. She
  naively said that many Church-people would subscribe if they
  saw my name on the list! I told her that it was rather hard to
  be asked so politely by her to do what I felt to be quite impossible,
  and added, "Do you think that your Bishop would subscribe
  to my cathedral?" Her answer was as prompt and clever as
  it was ambiguous--"Oh, you know that our Bishop is no example
  to you;" and, with a gracious smile, implying that she felt
  herself victrix, she left me.</p>
<p>December 3, Saturday.--I spent the morning in official writing.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I rode (about eight miles) to Te Kopuru,
  on the right bank of the river, and became the guest of the Rev.
  J. C. M. Wilson, clergyman of the district. Nearly all the people
  of the settlement are connected with the steam saw-mill of the
  place, the property of Dr. Campbell. At the present time there
  are about seventy men employed at the mill, whose wages vary
  from thirty-six to fifty shillings a week, for ten hours a day.
  The New Zealand wood trade has been in a depressed condition
  for many months, but is a little improved just now, there being
  several ships in the river loading for Australia and elsewhere,
  one of them--the <i>Aurora</i>, a barque of four hundred tons--for
  Glasgow. The opening up of immense forests by the new North-West
  Pacific Railway is said to be a chief cause of the reduced demand
  for our kauri pine wood.</p>
<p>[256] We have no church at Te Kopuru, but our people meet
  on Sundays in the Hall of the settlement, the property of the
  owner of the mill. This is a very undesirable arrangement; but,
  as the population are dependent on the mill, which may be closed
  at any time, it is thought unwise to go to the expense of building
  a church on land of our own.</p>
<p>On my arrival at the parsonage I found Mrs. Wilson and her
  friend, Miss Ballantyne, hard at work making muslin caps for
  Maori women and girls who were to be confirmed on the following
  day. It took them until late at night to complete their work--twenty-seven
  caps; but their toil was much appreciated by the twenty-seven
  Maories.</p>
<p>In my absence from Auckland, on this day, E. was invited to
  a special meeting of the Associates of the Girls' Friendly Society,
  at the house of the vice-president, Mrs. J. M. Clark, when, to
  her astonishment, the following address was presented to her,
  accompanied by a beautiful casket, made of New Zealand woods,
  and also a handsome travelling bag from Mrs. Clark herself:--</p>
<p>"Dear Mrs. Cowie,--The Associates of the Girls' Friendly
  Society beg your acceptance of this little token of our loving
  regard for you, and your work among us. We know that you will
  not measure our love by the smallness of our gift. We shall miss
  your presence; but the influence of your example of devotion
  to duty will stimulate us to try and do likewise while you are
  absent from us. We pray God to keep you in safety, and bring
  you back to us rested and refreshed in body and mind." Signed
  by the Associates.</p>
<p>December 4, Sunday.--A day of services. At ten [256/257] o'clock
  the rite of Laying on of Hands was administered to sixty-three
  Maories--thirty-six men and youths, and twenty-seven women and
  girls, who had been prepared, and were presented, by the Rev.
  Wiki te Paa, one of my chaplains, whose head-quarters are at
  Waimamaku, Hokianga, about seventy miles distant. He, accompanied
  by his wife Damaris, had ridden to Te Kopuru a few days before,
  bringing some of the candidates with him from Whangape (one hundred
  miles distant), and being joined by others on the road--at Opanake,
  Taita, and other native settlements. Some came to him from the
  other side of the Wairoa river--from Orapuhoe, Parirau, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It was unfortunately a wet and stormy morning; but the Hall
  was quite full at the Confirmation, the congregation consisting
  almost entirely of Maories, well dressed, healthy-looking, and
  reverent in bearing, as they always are. Philip Herewini, a gentle-mannered
  and intelligent Maori youth, from Waiparera, Hokianga, formerly
  a student at S. Stephen's, Parnell, gave me much help in making
  arrangements for the service; especially in arranging the candidates
  in the order in which their names stood in the list which Wiki
  had written out for me. The hymns (translations from "Hymns,
  Ancient and Modern") were heartily sung, being led by Damaris,
  the refined and accomplished wife of Wiki. The offertory collection
  amounted to £2 13s. 6d., which I was requested to accept
  for any purpose I liked. I accordingly asked Wiki to apply it
  to the travelling expenses of his people, after paying for the
  muslin of which the Confirmation caps were made.</p>
<p>At 11.30, our second service began, for the combined [257/258]
  congregations of Europeans and Maories. The Hall was filled to
  overflowing. A good many of the Maories seemed to be able to
  follow my sermon--in English. I was assisted at Holy Communion
  by the Revs. J. C. M. Wilson and W. te Paa. There were nearly
  a hundred communicants, including all the newly confirmed.</p>
<p>Afterwards I baptized two infants, one of them being Mr. Wilson's
  son.</p>
<p>As soon as we could pack up our things and saddle our horses,
  we left for Aratapu, about three miles up the river, which is
  wide at this point, and rapid. This afternoon a strong west wind
  was blowing, which, with the opposing tide, raised very formidable
  waves. I was glad not to have to travel, as in former times,
  in a small boat on such stormy waters, there being now a fairly
  good road up the right bank of the river. In the days when boating
  was the only means of travelling in this district, the Rev. F.
  T. Raker was the clergyman--a very skilful boatman, with whom
  I used to feel quite safe, even in a gale with a sail up.</p>
<p>The Aratapu service was at three p.m. The pretty little church
  of All Saints' was built in 1883. The then clergyman of the district,
  unfortunately for him, signed the contract for the building,
  and had to pay a large part of its cost, as there was a considerable
  deficiency in the fund. I am always hoping to hear that this
  debt of honour has been paid by our Aratapu people to the Rev.
  F. T. Baker.</p>
<p>At the service the church was well filled, as our churches
  generally are when there is a Confirmation. I was assisted by
  Mr. Wilson, clergyman of the district. I took as the subject
  of my address to the [258/259] candidates S. John's account of
  the feeding of the five thousand.</p>
<p>The Aratapu (<i>via sacra</i>) settlement is chiefly the property
  of the "Sash and Door Saw-Mill Company," employing
  at present about seventy men. Their timber is brought from forests
  some miles further up the river. At 4.30, we mounted our horses
  again for Dargaville, where evening service was held at seven.
  The church here, Holy Trinity, is particularly well situated,
  on a hillock just outside the township. The site was given by
  Mr. Dargaville, who also contributed the greater part of the
  cost of the building, which was £700. At the service, Evening
  Prayer was said by Mr. Wilson, and I preached. There was a good
  congregation. Three persons were confirmed, of whom one was Mr.
  Dargaville's son. The harmonium was played by Mr. Bcart, the
  district engineer.</p>
<p>Dargaville is the terminus of the short railway that is being
  constructed to the west coast, for the purpose of bringing timber
  from the extensive kauri forests of that district.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I rode to Te Kopuru, accompanied by Mr.
  F. J. Dargaville, who does credit to Christ's College, Christchurch,
  where he was a student for two or three years. From Te Kopuru
  I crossed the rushing river in a south-west gale in Mr. Wilson's
  boat, he rowing, and I steering and baling. Some years ago, a
  friend, on returning from this district, in speaking of the then
  clergyman and his work--involving many crossings of this inland
  sea, often very rough--said, casually, as a thing to be expected,
  "He will, of course, be drowned some day." So far,
  happily, no one of the four clergy</p>
<p>[259/260] who have been in charge of the district has met
  with a watery grave, though one only of them was a skilful boatman,
  namely, the Rev. F. T. Baker. On one occasion in particular I
  witnessed his remarkable skill in managing his little skiff.
  We were going down the river from Mangawhare to Te Kopuru on
  a Sunday afternoon, in half a gale from the west, with an ebbing
  tide, flying before the wind, by the help of a small sail. Mr.
  Baker had, I think, no rudder; but steered the boat to a nicety
  by creeping about it, at one time depressing the bow, and so
  exposing the stern to the force of the wind, and at another reversing
  the process. We reached our destination so rapidly that the manager
  of the mill there, on meeting us, could scarcely believe that
  we had come down the troubled river since morning service, adding,
  "I would not have come with you to-day for twenty pounds."</p>
<p>We reached Whakahara about six p.m., and were hospitably received
  by Mr. and Mrs. Clark, who have lived here for more than thirty
  years, and have now-more than fifty descendants living round
  about them.</p>
<p>In the evening, we had service in a large barn on the wooded
  hill behind the house. The night was dark and tempestuous, and
  the tracks are rough and hilly; but several people had ridden
  more than six miles to be present. I said prayers--short Evensong,
  and preached, the Lesson being read by Mr. Wilson. I also baptized
  three children. During the day several persons spoke to me most
  kindly in reference to our intended departure for England. One
  of these said, "There are many people who will miss you
  much--especially Mrs. Cowie. There are clergymen who may be engaged
  to do much [260/261] of the Bishop's work; but Mrs. Cowie's place
  no one can take." I quite agreed with him.</p>
<p>The <i>Southern Cross</i>, Melanesian Mission vessel, reached
  Auckland in the evening, bringing Bishop Selwyn (on his way to
  Sydney), the Rev. J. H. Plant and Mrs. Colenso of the Mission
  staff, Mrs. Ashwell, and others. Mrs. Colenso is the daughter
  of a late missionary of the Church Missionary Society, and is
  a good Maori scholar. For the last fourteen years she has lived
  at S. Barnabas' College, Norfolk Island, and given valuable help
  in teaching and caring for the Melanesian girls. Mrs. Ashwell
  is one of our oldest New Zealand friends, being the widow of
  the Rev. B. Y. Ashwell, of the Church Missionary Society, to
  whom we and our children were greatly attached. Mrs. Ashwell
  devotes herself to helping those who are in trouble--of mind,
  body, or estate; and her return to Auckland, from a visit to
  Norfolk Island, is accordingly welcomed by many besides her private
  friends.</p>
<p>December 6, Tuesday.--I left Whakahara at five a.m. in a small
  steamer of fifty-two tons, the Kina, for Helensville, where I
  arrived in time to catch the midday train to Auckland. A violent
  wind from the west blew all day, and crossing the Kaipara Heads
  under the circumstances was a very unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>December 9, Friday.--In the evening, I left for Whangarei
  (about eighty miles north of Auckland) by the steamship Wellington,
  of which Mr. Edward Stephen-son is captain--a very careful man,
  and one specially well acquainted with this coast. A little more
  than ten years ago, he was serving "before the mast"
  in the same vessel, which was then the favourite steamer on the
  [261/262] west coast of this island. The passage to Whangarei
  took eight hours, from wharf to wharf. From the landing-place
  to the township (about three miles) there is a railway, of which
  the terminus is at the Kamo coal mines, about four miles further
  on. Unfortunately for the district, the mines are not now being
  regularly worked, as the shareholders have been losers by them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I met the candidates for Confirmation in
  the church, and gave them some instruction.</p>
<p>Whangarei is one of the older settlements of the north, and
  is famous for the abundance and the superiority of its fruit,
  especially lemons and oranges. In the evening, I went to Wairere,
  to see Mr. Dobbie's orange and lemon trees, planted in regular
  rows over about twenty-five acres of scoria soil. The trees are
  now six years old, and are bearing well. The orange season is
  just over, but some of the lemon trees have still a quantity
  of ripe fruit on them--very fine in size and quality. Some Lisbon
  lemons given to me by Mr. Dobbie weighed each nine ounces, and
  one of a larger kind weighed nineteen ounces. Mr. Dobbie's orchard
  is a model of order and neatness, and will, no doubt, before
  long be a very profitable estate. The land slopes down to a beautiful
  stream, on the banks of which, in a deep glen, there are lovely
  tree-ferns and other luxuriant vegetation; and on the other side
  of the water, which is sometimes in winter a rushing torrent,
  ten feet deep, a high hill rises precipitously, partly covered
  with forest. Mr. Dobbie's indefatigable industry and good taste
  have in a few years turned a wilderness into a paradise, showing
  his neighbour settlers what can be effected by a possessor of
  those qualities, and encouraging them to [263/263] exert themselves
  for the improvement of their lands and their circumstances. In
  other respects also Mr. Dobbie is a very valuable member of the
  community. lie is the moving spirit of the Philharmonic Society
  of the settlement, and the instructor of the Volunteer band.
  All this is done by him, in addition to the efficient discharge
  of his public duties, as manager of the seven miles of Government
  railway. In most of our country settlements our young people
  greatly need the stimulus of such an example as Mr. Dobbie sets,
  of industry and thoroughness in the cultivation of his land.
  Many of our young men seem to undervalue the "remnants"
  of the day, which, if not spent systematically in profitable
  employment, are generally squandered in expensive, if not harmful,
  frivolity or idleness.</p>
<p>December 11, Sunday.--At eleven a.m. I preached and held a
  Confirmation at Christchnrch, Whangarei. The building is a little
  more than a mile from the township; and consequently many of
  our people find it difficult to get there more than once on Sunday,
  and even once when the weather is wet or very hot, as it often
  is in this part of the island. At this service the prayers were
  said by the Rev. L. L. Cubitt, the clergyman of the district.
  The harmonium was played, with much feeling, by Mr. Taylor, a
  son of the late clergyman of Mauku; and the singing was hearty.
  This church was considerably enlarged and improved two years
  ago, and is now one of the best of our country churches.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Mr. Cubitt went to Ruatangata (about nine
  miles distant), one of his outlying congregations, returning
  in time for the evening service.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I held a children's service at three. [263/264]
  The harmonium was played by Miss Clendon, the daughter of the
  resident magistrate. In the evening, I went on to Kamo (about
  two and a half miles), being driven by Mr. R. Mair in his buggy.
  Kamo is a very pretty settlement, situated on high ground overlooking
  the river, and with picturesque hills on three sides. The little
  church here was opened in 1886, and is a monument of the zeal
  of the Rev. J. H. Hawkes and his faithful lay reader, Dr. Sissons,
  one of the oldest settlers of the district. The rite of Confirmation
  was administered. Mr. Hawkes, who said the prayers, had just
  arrived from holding service in two distant settlements. He thinks
  nothing of a ride of fifteen or twenty miles on Sunday, in addition
  to taking three full services.</p>
<p>December 12, Monday.--I went by land from Wha-ngarei to Kawakawa,
  about forty miles. It was not until recently that a wheeled conveyance
  could travel by this route, owing especially to the unbridged
  condition of the Wairoa and other streams. Much of the road is
  still very bad for driving, as may be inferred from the fact
  that, with very powerful horses and a first-rate driver, Mr.
  Cheeseman of Whangarei, it took me from 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. to
  accomplish the forty miles. The route for about twenty-five miles
  is through bleak fern-land, on which there are at present many
  men engaged in digging for the gum of the kauri pine, with which
  in former days this region must have been thickly covered. The
  Ruapekapeka (Bat's Nest) district in particular yields large
  quantities of this gum, it being easy for a man to earn five
  shillings a day by digging it out. The last few miles of the
  route are through the Waiomio Valley, where the land is good
  and the scenery interesting.</p>
<p>[265] Kawakawa is the chief coal-mining district of the northern
  island. The coal is much valued for steam vessels, several of
  which come hither regularly for their fuel. The mines have been
  worked since 1875, but very little dividend has been paid to
  the shareholders. The miners have been in receipt of good wages,
  some of them at times earning as much as £4 a week; and
  they are said to be generally steady men, who have deposited
  in the Savings Bank considerable sums. It is feared that the
  present mine will be worked out in two years' time. There is,
  however, no doubt that there are still large beds of coal in
  the district. We have a good church at Kawakawa. It was built
  in 1878, mainly by the energy of Mr. W. H. Williams, who was
  then the manager of the mine, and our lay reader. In the latter
  office his successor is at present Mr. B. D. O'Halloran, the
  telegraph officer of the settlement, whose ministrations are
  acceptable to all our people. We have a parsonage here, but it
  has, alas! been unoccupied for some months. In the absence of
  a resident clergyman, the Rev. Philip Walsh, of Waimate, spends
  one Sunday of each month in the district; but without house-to-house
  visiting, which cannot be accomplished by a minister living twelve
  miles distant, having withal four other churches in his charge,
  the congregation cannot be kept together, and--even worse--the
  children cannot be systematically taught the truths of the Gospel.</p>
<p>Among other faithful lay helpers who have done good work at
  iT. Paul's, Kawakawa, during many years, is Mr. Armstrong, the
  volunteer organist, who is master of the Government Day School.</p>
<p>December 13, Tuesday.--I continued my journey to [265/266]
  Russell (Kororareka), which was the original capital of New Zealand.
  From Kawakawa there is a railway for about eight miles, constructed
  a few years ago by the Government, for the purpose of conveying
  the coal to a point where the water is deep enough to allow of
  large vessels coming alongside the wharf--at Opua. For two or
  three miles the train runs through a district in which the sweetbriar
  in full bloom now overspreads the land, reminding me of the rose
  thickets of Cashmere, and making the air very fragrant. One of
  my fellow-travellers in the train was Mr. J. A. Caldwcll, the
  doctor of the district, a son of a well-known and learned missionary
  of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, now an Assistant-Bishop
  in the diocese of Madras, where he has dwelt for fifty years.
  From Opua I went by a small steam launch to Russell, in the Bay
  of Islands, where I spent a quiet day in writing. In early days
  I used to travel from Kawakawa to Russell in a small open boat,
  rowed by a very dark man, a native of the Azores, known as "Black
  Charlie." He used to say of himself that he was "the
  first <i>white man</i> who came to live in the district,"
  meaning the first man not a Maori. There is very little commerce
  being carried on at Russell now, and scarcely any one residing
  at Paihia, on the opposite side of the bay. Until the Government
  put a stop to the unlimited gathering of oysters in 1886, between
  twenty and thirty thousand sacks, each containing four bushels,
  were exported yearly, chiefly to Sydney. The sacks were valued
  at five shillings each on the Russell wharf. It is said that
  Russell oysters are now growing along a hundred miles of shore
  in the colony of New South Wales.</p>
<p>[267] Almost every day now brings us kind letters from all
  parts of the diocese, wishing us God-speed on our visit to England.
  Among those last received is a characteristic one from an old
  soldier, who hopes that we will return, but also that I shall
  "obtain promotion."</p>
<p>The last occasion on which a soldier spoke of my "obtaining
  promotion" was in 1864, after the Umbeyla campaign (against
  the Afghan tribes), when I was Chaplain to the force commanded
  by Sir Neville Chamberlain, and subsequently (after Sir Neville
  was wounded) by General Wilde. Sir Hugh Rose (afterwards Lord
  Strathnairn) was then Commander-in-Chief in India. He was having
  a friendly chat with me, at Peshawur, about the campaign, and
  said, partly in joke, "I don't know how you are to be rewarded.
  I cannot, I fear, get you made a brevet-Bishop." I availed
  myself of the opportunity to ask him to give a helping hand to
  a younger brother, then a subaltern of artillery. "You cannot
  do anything for me," I answered, "but you can bestow
  some favour on my artillery brother." lie asked me, "How?"
  and I answered, "By putting him into the Horse Artillery,
  or recommending him to the Viceroy for an Ordnance appointment."
  He was appointed to the Ordnance shortly afterwards, and is now
  nearly at the head of the department. [Lieut. Crombie Cowie,
  now a Colonel, and Deputy-Inspector-General of Ordnance.] My
  soldier correspondent who hopes that I may "obtain promotion"
  was one of Havelock's men, who would not know when they were
  beaten, and forced themselves into Lucknow, in September, 1857,
  through the narrow city streets, in which almost every house
  was loopholed and occupied by men [267/268] with firearms. It
  is a matter of surprise to me that more retired soldiers have
  not come to New Zealand in recent years to settle. The climate
  is specially fitted to restore to health those who have borne
  "the burden and heat of the day" in the army, and whose
  physical energies need all the support they can receive from
  surroundings. I am thinking of those soldiers only who have earned
  a pension sufficient to obtain for them the bare necessaries
  of life. In the present condition of the colony, I could not
  advise soldiers or sailors without pensions or private means
  to come to New Zealand in the hope of being able easily to obtain
  employment that would secure many of the comforts of life.</p>
<p>In riding through the country, sometimes alone, I generally
  renew some former acquaintance--with travellers going my way.
  I do not often forget the faces of people with whom I have had
  to do, but I cannot always at once remember the names of their
  owners. Not very long ago, on one of my long rides, I overtook
  a traveller on foot, who at once addressed me by name, though
  I could not remember his, as I told him. He then reminded me
  of our former intercourse, with great glee, as follows:--"Don't
  you remember staying at C------'s hotel at------? I was in charge
  at the time. The rule was not to take anything from ministers
  of religion who stayed at the hotel; but we were told to make
  Bishop Cowie pay for everything." "Why was I to be
  so distinguished?" I asked; and he answered, "Oh, you
  took away our minister, you know." After a good laugh over
  the story, I told my friend the facts of the case, which were
  as follows, but, of course, could not have been made known by
  me at the time, without injuring [268/269] the clergyman concerned.
  The Rev. Mr.------came to us <i>proprio motu</i> from Ireland,
  and was appointed by me to the charge of the district referred
  to. He was a man of considerable ability, and was much liked
  and respected by the people. He was, however, of a morbidly sensitive
  disposition in some matters; and before long got an idea into
  his head that the most influential person in the district disliked
  him, and was in communication with certain old personal enemies
  of his in Ireland, with whom he (the parishioner referred to)
  was plotting his ruin. I did all I could to dissuade the clergyman
  from entertaining such thoughts, but to no effect. At last he
  informed me that, whatever happened, he must at once resign his
  then charge, whether I had other work for him or not. I accordingly
  appointed him to a temporary cure in Auckland. On quitting his
  country charge, he told the people that "he was very sorry
  to leave them, but that he considered it to be his duty to go
  wherever the Bishop wished him." This statement was quite
  true; but he did not feel himself able, I suppose, to add--which
  would also have been true--"There are, however, reasons,
  known to the Bishop, why I feel that I cannot in any case remain
  with you any longer." Many of the people naturally concluded
  that I had obliged or induced their clergyman to leave them,
  contrary to his wish. He soon afterwards left New Zealand. Every
  one in authority has, of course, often to hold his tongue, and
  to endure misrepresentation, when he might at once justify himself,
  and even receive popular applause, if he thought it right to
  publish all the facts of a misunderstood case. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>.</p>
<p>In reference to another case of this kind, a senior [269/270]
  clergyman of the diocese once said to me, "I cannot imagine
  a position less desirable than that of a Bishop in a colony."
  The speaker's experience of "positions" was not very
  extensive. Bishops of Colonial Churches have, no doubt, many
  unpleasantnesses to put up with; but so have other persons in
  any position of authority. They have also some advantages over
  Bishops of an "established" Church. <i>We</i> cannot
  be told that we are living in luxury, on incomes taken by taxation
  from unwilling people; as the English Bishops are sometimes told,
  in ignorance of the history of Church endowments. The stipend
  of the Bishop of Auckland, like that of other New Zealand Bishops,
  is barely sufficient, with the strictest economy, to meet the
  necessary expenses of the position. We cannot be suspected of
  looking out for preferment or advancement. Translation from one
  see to another in New Zealand is almost impossible, even if any
  Bishop should desire it. The Primacy, to which is attached no
  special emolument or advantage, is the only ecclesiastical distinction
  that can come to any of our Bishops; and, except in extraordinary
  circumstances, e.g. of bodily or mental infirmity, that office
  would, as a matter of course, be conferred on the senior one
  among them. There are, moreover, positive advantages possessed
  by our New Zealand Bishops. We are independent of the "favours"
  of patrons of whatever kind. It matters not to us personally
  who is Governor or Premier of the colony. So long as we possess
  the hearts of our people, we can exercise great influence for
  good among the population generally. Each of us can act as a
  <i>tribunus plebis</i>, without fear of loss of any kind, and--what
  is far more--without the suspicion of unworthy [270/271] motives.
  From ignorant and vulgar misunderstandings and disloyal misrepresentations
  no official, clerical or lay, in old countries or new, can expect
  to be free. In a small house in a country district, I once heard
  a mother--my hostess--say to a troublesome child in the next
  room, "Be quiet, or the Bishop will take you." I thought
  it rather hard to be made a bogey of in this fashion, but looked
  upon it as part of the day's work.</p>
<p>At Russell I met the Rev. J. Haselden, who had arrived two
  days before from Auckland, to prepare candidates for Confirmation,
  in the absence of a resident clergyman.</p>
<p>In the evening, at 7.30, there was service in the church.
  Mr. Haselden said the prayers, and I gave a short address. The
  singing was good and hearty, mainly owing to the efficient work
  of Miss Fanny Stephenson, who has been organist for many years,
  and to Mr. T. Philson, manager of the local Bank of New Zealand,
  the choir-master.</p>
<p>December 14, Wednesday.--The Rev. Philip Walsh, one of my
  chaplains, arrived from Waimate. In the evening, at 7.30, there
  was service at Christchurch. Mr. Walsh said prayers, and I preached
  and held a Confirmation. The candidates were presented by the
  Rev. John Haselden. There was a large congregation. The church
  was tastefully decorated, the white lilies and magnolias above
  the Holy Table being specially beautiful. There is a small endowment
  fund belonging to this church, formed more than twelve years
  ago--from the weekly offerings of the congregation, when there
  was no clergyman--chiefly by the thoughtfulness of the late Mr.
  [271/272] Samuel Ford, the medical man of the district, who was
  lay reader. The fund now amounts to £600, and is lent on
  mortgage. [The trustees are Archdeacon Clarke and Mr. J. H. Greenway.]</p>
<p>December 15, Thursday.--At 9.30 a.m. there was a celebration
  of Holy Communion at Christchurch, chiefly for the sake of the
  newly confirmed.</p>
<p>In the evening, I left Russell for Auckland.</p>
<p>December 17.--H.M.'s ships <i>Nelson </i>and <i>Rapid</i>
  arrived from Sydney and New Guinea respectively; the former being
  the flagship of Admiral Fairfax, now commanding the Australian
  squadron. There is also in our harbour at present H.M.'s ship
  <i>Diamond</i>, recently arrived from Sydney. It is a long time
  since we had three of H.M.'s ships here at one time. The presence
  of a Queen's ship in our harbour is always an occasion of rejoicing
  with the community in general; and personally I have reasons
  for thinking with pleasure of my intercourse with the blue-jackets.
  On our arrival in New Zealand on February 3, 1870, from Australia,
  we had scarcely reached the wharf when a man-of-war's boat came
  alongside from Admiral Hornby, who had arrived the day before,
  in command of the Flying Squadron, with offers of help.</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to Clevedon (Wairoa South), about twenty-seven
  miles south of Auckland, and became the guest of Mr. W. H. Thorp,
  the lay reader of the district. There is now a fairly good road
  for driving--in dry weather--from Papakura, unmetalled most of
  the way.</p>
<p>December 18, Sunday.--In the morning, I held a Confirmation,
  and preached at All Souls' Church, [272/273] Clevedon, one of
  the oldest of our country churches. It was a brilliant day, and
  the little building, which is near the centre of an extensive
  district, was quite full. The prayers were said by the Rev. O.
  R. Hewlett, whose head-quarters are at Papakura, about eight
  miles distant, and whose charge extends from sea to sea, that
  is, from the salt water at Papakura to the salt water of the
  southern Wairoa. Fortunately for the scattered people of his
  extensive charge, he has inherited the zeal, energy, and physical
  endurance of his father,* which is saying not a little. The Lessons
  were read by Mr. W. H Thorp--"a devout man, and one that
  fears God, with all his house." One of his younger brothers
  is the superintendent of the Sunday school, in which for many
  years, Miss Hyde has been a faithful teacher; and a niece, Miss
  Katie Brown, is the organist.</p>
<p>After a hurried meal at Mr. Thorp's, I left, in Mr. Hewlett's
  buggy, for Drury, about eleven miles distant, where I was due
  at three p.m. S. John's, Drury, is another of our older churches,
  having been built before the war of 1863. Close to the church
  is a small cottage, built about the same time, in which Bishop
  Selwyn used to stay when journeying to and fro in those days,
  ministering to the troops. S.John's,like all the churches with
  which Mr. Hewlett has to do, has greatly improved in appearance
  since it has been in his charge. The service this afternoon consisted
  of part of Evening Prayer and the Order of Confirmation, the
  former being said by Mr. Hewlett. Miss Euphemia Blake is, and
  has been for several years, the efficient organist. On our way
  to Drury, we met a considerable number of persons [273/274] on
  their way to a Salvation Army meeting. Though the population
  of the district is less than a thousand, there are places of
  worship belonging to Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Wesleyans,
  Salvationists, and Plymouth Brethren, as well as our own; and
  the maintenance of ministers, services, and buildings is provided
  from the voluntary offerings of the congregations.</p>
<p>After the Drury service, we drove back, about four miles,
  to Mr. Hewlett's parsonage at Papakura. This house and the land
  attached (six acres) have respectively been built and acquired
  for the Church through his foresight and perseverance. It is
  a model parsonage and glebe, being in perfect order, and utilised
  to the utmost. The house is plainly but suitably furnished. Close
  to it on one side there are a small vegetable garden and an orchard,
  containing a good crop of potatoes and cabbages, a bed of strawberries,
  and several young peach and apricot trees with a promise of fruit.
  Behind the house are a stable and other outbuildings. We had
  not arrived many minutes before Mr. Hewlett was to be seen milking
  his cow. He and his helpmeet [Gen. ii. 18.] wife have no regular
  servant to assist them, though there are three children under
  two years of age to be cared for; much hospitality is dispensed,
  and Mr. Hewlett has rarely a whole day at home. With early rising,
  method, and using up faithfully the remnants of our days, what
  may not be done!</p>
<p>Mr. Hewlett first became known to me by acting as my guide,
  in a distant part of the diocese, where he was at the time helping
  his father in the cultivation of a small section of poor land.
  He afterwards obtained a studentship at our College of S. John,
  and was in due time [272/273] ordained; and, by dint of indomitable
  perseverance, has since passed Grade III. of the theological
  examination held annually under the direction of our General
  Synod.</p>
<p>In the evening, service was held at Christchurch, Papakura,
  where I again held a Confirmation and preached, Mr. Hewlett saying
  Evening Prayer. Like All Souls' and 6\ John's, where we ministered
  in the morning and afternoon, this church also is one of our
  oldest; but, unlike them, it has a good chancel and transepts,
  and the interior is capable of being made quite ecclesiastical,
  as it doubtless will be, if Mr. Hewlett remains in charge, when
  more important matters--needing time, labour, and money--have
  been set in order. During the quarter of a century of its existence
  Christ-church has had several zealous and efficient lay officers,
  male and female--notably Mr. W. Smith, the churchwarden, and
  Miss Baylis, who conducted the Sunday school for several years;
  but there is one family, that of the late Mr. Willis, to whom
  the people are specially indebted for all kinds of good work
  in connection with the Church. Miss Fanny Willis is at present
  the organist, and is among the first in general helpfulness to
  the clergyman.</p>
<p>From the manner of young people at a Confirmation, I can often
  gather much concerning the sort of teaching received by them
  at home and in the day school. At Papakura, as in most of our
  churches, I had nothing to complain of in this respect; but occasionally
  in some churches it is distressing to think of the causes which
  must have produced the results witnessed. For instance, at a
  certain church, according to my custom after a [275/276] Confirmation
  service, I went to the benches on which the newly confirmed were
  sitting, and held out my hand to each of the young women in turn,
  to shake hands with them. Not one of them had the grace to rise
  from her seat when giving me her hand; and some of them leant
  back, acid stretched out their hands for me to shake. Afterwards
  I asked a Church officer whether he could account for such a
  general want of good manners among the young parishioners, and
  he answered, "The master of the Board School here is an
  unbeliever, and the children have no habits of courtesy."
  It does not necessarily follow that because a man calls himself
  an agnostic (i.e. ignoramus), or, worse, that he is unmannerly;
  but S. Paul's words, "Love is <i>not rude</i>," are
  very suggestive in many such cases. [I Cor. xiii. 5.]</p>
<p>December 19, Monday.--Accompanied by my son Edmund, who had
  been the guest of Mr. and Mrs. S. Walker, on many former occasions
  our kind hospitisers, I rode to Mauku, about twelve miles. Our
  road was through a bleak, undulating country, covered with low
  fern and ti-trees. We missed our track, and found ourselves at
  Helvetia, a new settlement of families from Switzerland. Here
  we had the good fortune to meet Mr. Ernst Eugster, at whose cottage
  we called to inquire where we had got to. He very kindly saddled
  his horse, and escorted us for some miles on our way. He informed
  us that he and his countrymen were engaged in making cheese after
  the Swiss fashion. As they could not afford to sell it for less
  than ninepence a pound, a price too high for the local market,
  they sent their cheeses to London, where they obtained a ready
  sale.</p>
<p>[277] I reached Stanlake, the hospitable home of our friends,
  Mr. and Mrs. Heywood Crispe, before noon. When first we stayed
  at Stanlake, it was the home of our host's father and mother,
  to whom the Church-people of the district, and the settlers generally,
  were much indebted in many ways, and especially for the church--6\
  Bride s, and the parsonage. The soil of Mr. Crispe's orchard
  is specially suited to lemons, which grow to great perfection
  on trees near the house. At three o'clock a Confirmation was
  held at .S. Bride's. I was assisted by the Rev. N. D. Boyes,
  the deacon-curate of the district, which is very extensive. The
  harmonium was played by Mrs. Wily, the widow of Major Wily, and
  a sister of my late dear college friend, Edmund Jenner, who was
  at the time of his death Rector of Catton, in Yorkshire. In the
  church grounds there are some camellia bushes and flowers. This
  custom of making the surroundings of the church bright with shrubs
  and flowers will, I hope, be followed in all our parishes and
  districts. At 4.30, I set out for Waiuku, about seven miles distant,
  where a Confirmation service was held at 7.30 p.m. I was again
  assisted by Mr. Boyes. There was a good congregation. The harmonium
  was played by Miss Flexman. There were some beautiful flowers
  on the Holy Table.</p>
<p>During four years, from January, 1883, this district formed
  the charge of the Rev. Colin C. Cokayne Frith, who has returned
  to England. His zeal and indefatigable energy, notwithstanding
  much ill-health, stirred up our people--especially the younger
  portion of them--to value their Church privileges, as many of
  them had not done before. His successor has ministered to his
  [277/278] scattered flock with the same untiring devotion; but,
  being only in Deacon's Orders, he has not, of course, been able
  to continue all the services which the congregation enjoyed during
  Mr. Frith's incumbency. In the grounds of Holy Trinity Church
  there are some beds in good order, at present brilliant with
  roses and other flowers. We were to have stayed at Waiuku for
  the night, at the house of our friend Mrs. King; but as there
  was a moon--to save time on the morrow--we rode back to Mauku,
  where we arrived about eleven p.m. We had been on the road nearly
  fifteen hours.</p>
<p>At Mauku I was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Boyes at the parsonage,
  a pretty little house, with a fine orchard, which is bounded
  by a beautiful stream. The fruit trees were carefully selected
  by the late Rev. W. Taylor, to whom his successors are indebted
  for his forethought in this matter. If each tenant of a parsonage
  will do only a little to improve the Church property of which
  he has the use, the homes of our clergy will become very soon,
  in our New Zealand climate, as beautiful as any of those in England.
  Mr. and Mrs. Boyes are sure to make their Waiuku home, where
  they will live after this summer, all that care and good taste
  can make it.</p>
<p>December 20, Tuesday.--I left Mauku at 5.30 a.m., and rode
  to Pukekohe, about seven miles, in time to go by the early train
  to Auckland. At this season I always do my riding as early in
  the day as I can. On a horse that can walk well, as mine can,
  this mode of travelling is very enjoyable in dry weather in New
  Zealand. I find that I can ride twenty miles a day, taking one
  or two services on the road, without feeling fatigued. From the
  houses of some kind friends, however, it is difficult [278/279]
  to make an early start; and in such cases the journey is often
  very wearisome, involving as it does the necessity for hurrying,
  which is not pleasant when the horseman has his baggage to carry
  on his saddle, and has to ride during the heat of the day, often
  without any shelter from the sun for many miles. The mistaken
  kindness of friends--instead of speeding the parting guest--delays
  him often an hour and more after the time agreed upon for his
  setting out; and the result is discomfort, late arrival at the
  next settlement, and often weariness in addition, and unfitness
  for the particular duty appointed. At Mauku my kind entertainers
  are always very punctual.</p>
<p>Near Pukekohe we passed many carts taking cans of milk, now
  sold at threepence a gallon, to the Freezing Company's establishment,
  where, I am told, the cream is extracted from the milk by some
  new centrifugal process, and the milk is returned to the settlers.
  The cream is sent to Auckland, and made into butter.</p>
<p>This will, I think, prove to be my last expedition of this
  kind before our departure for England, where it is not thought
  correct for Bishops to do everything for themselves, as has always
  been the custom in this diocese. I remember, in 1869, when Bishop
  Selwyn had just begun his work in the diocese of Lichfield, having
  resigned the charge of this diocese, a clergyman of his diocese,
  who was also the squire of the parish, complaining of the Bishop's
  undignified ways in moving about the diocese. In this particular
  case he had sent on his portmanteau by a friend's carriage, and
  himself followed on foot to a country church, to hold a Confirmation.
  He sometimes aggravated the offence by carrying his own robe-bag.</p>
<p>[280] This morning, according to my custom, I carried all
  my baggage, namely, a saddle and bridle, etc., and leather saddle-bags,
  a black-leather robe-bag, and a mackintosh, from the Newmarket
  station to the Parnell omnibus. No one was surprised to see me
  do it, and no one offered to help me. The independence of our
  New Zealand ways is delightful! It must not be inferred from
  the above statement that our young men in New Zealand are unmannerly.
  Quite the opposite is the case. Almost the only children absolutely
  rude that I ever came across in Auckland were the son and daughter
  of a high official, who afterwards became a Governor of a colony.
  The wife of this official was calling at Bishopscourt, with her
  two children, who were told by their mother to shake hands with
  our (then) little daughter. They declined to do so; the little
  boy saying angrily, "I won't." Instead of reproving
  her children for their rudeness, the mother seemed rather to
  be proud of it, and said, in an almost approving tone, "They
  always hate other children." It seemed plain who was to
  blame in this case--certainly not the children. In the evening,
  we went to Devonport, where I held a Confirmation. This is a
  beautiful marine suburb of Auckland, formerly known as the North
  Shore. The older part of the settlement is almost an island,
  and forms the North Head, which has to be rounded by vessels
  entering our harbour from that quarter. On the peninsula are
  two round hills of scoria, on one of which is the flagstaff whence
  approaching vessels are signalled, and on the other are situated
  our recently constructed defensive works, named Fort Cautley,
  after the Engineer officer who planned them. The clergyman of
  the parish [280/281] is the Rev. Joseph Bates, one of my examining
  chaplains. He was educated at our college of S. John the Evangelist,
  and, worthily of the son of a soldier, has remained at the post
  to which he was appointed by me in 1872; ministering first to
  a small congregation in a very small building, and now discharging
  with efficiency the duties of the incumbent of a parish--into
  which the district has developed, possessing a large and handsome
  church. The erection of this new building and of a good parsonage
  close by, and--much more--the establishment of a large and well-taught
  Sunday school, bear evidence of the influence that Mr. Bates
  possesses with his people, and of the steadiness and thoroughness
  of his ministrations at Devonport. Mr. Bates is the secretary
  of our Sunday School Board, by means of which I am in hope that
  our Sunday schools generally may be benefited.</p>
<p>December 21, Tuesday.--In the afternoon, we went to S. John's
  College, Tamaki, to the distribution of prizes at the Rev. T.
  F. King's * school, at present held in the College buildings.
  The proceedings began with a concert, in which the boys acquitted
  themselves very well indeed. There was a large gathering of persons
  interested in the school. Among others with whom we had the pleasure
  of a few minutes' conversation were our old friends Mr. and Mrs.
  Boardman. Our days, when we are in Auckland, are so fully occupied
  from morning to night that we rarely have an opportunity for
  private intercourse with any of our Auckland people. As a rule,
  it is only when they come to Bishopscourt that we have any conversation
  with individuals. It is somewhat different with respect to our
  people living in country districts, [281/282] of whom we see
  more personally, during the intervals in my episcopal duties,
  when I am on visitation. For many years, when his health was
  stronger, Mr. Boardman was one of our most active Churchmen,
  especially as a member of the Diocesan Synod, the Standing Committee,
  and our General Trust Board. We are specially indebted to him
  for our excellent system of keeping our Trust accounts. Mrs.
  Boardman has been one of E.'s most valued and steadfast coadjutors
  in connection with the Orphan Home and the Girls' Friendly Society.
  Her interest and help can always be depended on in works of benevolence.</p>
<p>In the evening, I held a Confirmation at S. Mark's, supplementary
  to the administration of that rite here on July 24. There was
  a large congregation. The organ was played by Mr. Edwin Hesketh,
  of whose services in that honorary and honourable office the
  Rev. J. Richards, the incumbent, speaks in the highest terms.
  It is truly a labour of love with Mr. Hesketh, as may be inferred
  from the life with which his playing is instinct.</p>
<p>December 22, Thursday.--In the afternoon, we went to Howick.
  Our old friend, Mr. C. J. Wilson, met us at Ellerslie with his
  buggy, and drove us to Howick and back. At three p.m. I held
  a Confirmation in All Saints'. There was a large congregation,
  for a weekday and in the middle of harvesting, showing that the
  influence with his people of the Rev. A. S. Fox, who has been
  only a few months in the district, is not small.</p>
<p>In the evening, I held a Confirmation at Christchurch, Ellerslie,
  one of the suburbs of Auckland. Here we have a very pretty church,
  in which all the windows are [282/283] filled with painted glass--the
  gift of Mr. Bell, of the firm of Messrs. Clayton and Bell. The
  clergyman in charge is the Rev. P. S. Smallfield, one of our
  most skilful teachers of children, with whom his patience and
  imperturbable good temper are irresistible. The windows of this
  church were presented through Mr. Albert Martin, one of our principal
  amateur artists, who was acquainted with Mr. Bell from his boyhood.</p>
<p>December 23, Friday.--The grounds of Bishopscourt were lent
  to the authorities of S. Mary's parish for the day, for the purposes
  of a<i> fête</i>, for the benefit of a fund for furnishing
  the chancel of their new church, which is for the present to
  be the cathedral of the diocese. Great enthusiasm was shown by
  many of the parishioners in the undertaking. Many beautiful and
  useful things were offered for sale, the handiwork of the people.
  The weather was perfect--the sun being bright, and the air cool,
  coming in fresh from the sea. Our many spreading trees--oaks,
  pines, cypresses, and others--were at their best in their early
  summer foliage. The band of H.M.'s ship <i>Nelson</i> was kindly
  lent by Captain Hammill. In the course of the afternoon the <i>fête</i>
  was visited by Admiral and Mrs. Fairfax, and by several of the
  officers of H.M.'s ships now in our harbour, the <i>Nelson</i>,
  <i>Diamond</i>, and <i>Rapid</i>. In the evening, between eight
  o'clock and ten, a great many people came to the <i>fête</i>.
  It was a moonlight night; and, in addition, many lanterns--Chinese
  and others--were suspended from the trees, producing a very pretty
  effect. Glees were sung by some of the parishioners standing
  in the balcony, and the <i>Nelson</i>'s band played in the grounds.
  It is expected that £50 will be added to the Church Fund
  as the [283/284] result of the<i> fête</i>. The stall-holders
  and others did their work very efficiently; but the chief responsibility
  was borne, and the greater part of the arrangements were made,
  by Mr. Herbert Walpole, who was zealously and ably assisted by
  his wife.</p>
<p>December 24, Saturday.--In the evening, I had a conference
  with Archdeacon Clarke and some of the Maori clergy. The latter
  had come to Auckland to be present at the ordination of two Maories
  on S. Stephen's Day, namely, Hare Reweti Hukatere and Herewini
  Nopera Paerata, both of the Rarawa tribe, in the extreme north
  of this island.</p>
<p>Christmas Day.--I was to have preached at S. Stephen's in
  the morning, and S. Mark's in the evening; but, partly from over-fatigue
  and partly from having got a chill, I was voiceless on this day,
  and unable to give any help in the day's services.</p>
<p>December 26, 51. Stephen's Day.--At ten a.m. there was an
  Ordination service at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Auckland,
  when I admitted to the Order of Deacons two Maories, namely Hare
  Reweti Hukatere and Herewini Nopera Paerata, both of the Rarawa
  tribe, whose country is in the extreme north of the diocese.
  The former was in his youth a pupil of the Rev. Joseph Matthews,
  of Kaitaia, and afterwards of the Rev. R. Burrows at Waimate.
  He has been a lay reader since 1858. He was for some years native
  assessor of the Resident Magistrate's Court at Mangonui; and
  in that office gave satisfaction to the Government, and gained
  the confidence of his fellow-countrymen.</p>
<p>Paerata is a nephew of the late Rev. Rupene Paerata, and was
  also for two years a pupil of the Rev. R. [284/285] Burrows at
  Waimate. He has been a lay reader since 1875. For the last three
  years he has been a student at the Church Missionary Society
  College at Gisborne (in the diocese of Waiapu), under the direction
  of Archdeacon Leonard Williams. At this service the sermon was
  preached by Archdeacon Maunsell. The candidates were presented
  by Archdeacon Clarke. Each of the Maori clergy present, seven
  in number, exclusive of the new deacons, took part in the service,
  which was all in the Maori language.</p>
<p>The hymns, "The Church's one foundation" and "Come,
  Holy Ghost, our souls inspire," of which we have good Maori
  versions, set to the "Hymns, Ancient and Modern," tunes,
  were sung in English and Maori, to an organ accompaniment played
  by Miss Purchas. The offertory collection, by desire of the Maori
  clergy, was given to the Melanesian Mission. Besides the clergy
  already named as taking part in the service, there were present--Archdeacon
  Dudley, Incumbent of S. Sepulchre's, the Rev. A. G. Purchas,
  the Rev. G. H. S. Walpole, and the Rev. J. H. Plant (of the Melanesian
  Mission); also (in the congregation) the Rev. H. S. Davies and
  the Rev. H. T. Purchas (of the diocese of Christchurch).</p>
<p>The church was looking very pretty, with its simple and tasteful
  Christmas decorations.</p>
<p>I have now ordained fifteen Maories since I came to the diocese
  in 1870; but the number at present holding my licence is only
  eleven, five having died, two having gone to other dioceses,
  and two being unlicensed. The Maori clergy are maintained by
  our Native Pastorate Fund, supplemented by an annual [285/286]
  grant from the New Zealand estate of the Church Missionary Society.
  The Native Pastorate Fund consists mainly of sums contributed
  in past years by the Maori congregations, and a legacy of nearly
  £2000 bequeathed by the late Sir William Martin, formerly
  Chief Justice of New Zealand. The income of the fund in 1886-87
  was about £700, and the Church Missionary Society grant
  was £275. Donations to the fund, from many friends in England,
  and now amounting to a considerable sum, have been received through
  the Maories' "devoted friend," Miss C. J. D. Weale.</p>
<p>The Maori clergy in Priest's Orders receive each £60
  a year, and those in Deacon's Orders £50. As they live
  among their own people and cultivate their own lands, they manage
  generally to pay their way on these stipends; but the stipends
  should be increased as soon as the fund will admit of it.</p>
<p>In the evening, I rode to S. Aidan's, Mount Roskill, where
  a Confirmation was held at 7.30. The Preface was read by Archdeacon
  Dudley, of whose parish the S. Aidan's district forms a part.
  The candidates were presented by the Rev. E. J. Phillips, assistant-minister
  of S. Sepulchre's, the clergyman in charge of S. Alban's. Some
  of those who had been prepared for the rite were absent, having
  gone to the gum-fields, on account of the <i>res angustae domi</i>.</p>
<p>These gum-fields, where an able-bodied man can generally reckon
  on earning five shillings a day on an average, are an unfailing
  resource for our unemployed and impecunious people. They afford
  a very great advantage to this part of the colony, where alone
  the kauri forests grew and still grow.</p>
<p>[287] December 27, Tuesday.--In the afternoon, the S. Thomas's
  Church Temperance Association came to Bishopscourt by special
  invitation, under the leadership of the Rev. W. M. Du Rieu, incumbent
  of the parish. We expected a hundred members, but some of the
  young men were engaged elsewhere. Mr. Du Rieu's younger people
  were escorted by Mrs. and Miss Hamilton and the three Misses
  Cole, all zealous helpers in the general work of the parish.</p>
<p>The Maori clergy who had come to Auckland for the ordination,
  and to take leave of us, were also at the party, accompanied
  by Archdeacon and Mrs. Clarke, and three Maori girls from the
  Native Girls' School at Napier. Archdeacon and Miss Maunsell
  also came; and Mrs. Ashwell, Miss Maning, and Miss O'Grady--who
  has shown her care for the Maories by spending a month lately
  at Ohaeawai, acting as unpaid assistant to Mrs. Wyatt Watling
  in her Maori school. Some more ladies like Mrs. Watling are among
  our most urgent needs, for benefiting the "remnant that
  are left" of this noble race. [2 Kings xix.] Would that
  two or three English ladies of education and refinement, possessing
  private means, and not requiring pecuniary remuneration for their
  labours of love, would offer themselves to us for this work--of
  winning the hearts of the Maori children for the Saviour, and
  giving the young girls the refinement of which they are naturally
  so susceptive! After tea on the lower lawn at Bishopscourt, the
  Maori clergy presented me with a most kind address, of which
  the following is a translation, made by Archdeacon Clarke:--</p>
<p>"A farewell from us, the Maori clergy of the diocese
  [287/288] of Auckland, to the Bishop.--Go, father, in peace;
  wade through the sea of Kiwa which lies before you, the billowy
  way of Tawhaki. We feel bound to say loving words to you on your
  leaving for the land of your fathers--the land from whence came
  the Gospel to this island, there to take breath, this being the
  eighteenth year of your labour in the Maori Church. We greatly
  appreciate the efforts you have made to visit us, for there is
  no kainga of importance which you have not reached. Beginning
  at Parengarenga and through to Waikato and Taranaki, all has
  been travelled by you. The sheep of the flock, of which you are
  the shepherd, are of two colours--Europeans and Maories, and
  you have fed us all alike, impartially; none have been starved.
  For this we thank you. When you came to this country there were
  only five Maori clergy in the diocese. You have ordained fifteen
  more. Of the whole twenty clergy, five have gone to their rest,
  and two to other dioceses. There is one sad thing which your
  heart and our hearts mourn over--the loss of those three during
  this year: and so we stand before you 'a little flock' this day.
  When you first came there were but few churches; but now the
  country from the Thames to the North Cape is covered with good
  churches. These are signs by which we know that the Maori Church
  has made progress during those eighteen years. Although there
  are some districts in the diocese the people of which have not
  yet returned to the faith, we think that the time is near when
  the people of some of the places in Waikato will come back. Now,
  sire, we were troubled when we heard that you were going to England,
  there to remain; but we have heard your word to the Synod [288/289]
  that you intend to return, and that comforts our hearts. We were
  troubled because (1) we love you; we feared (2) lest 'another
  king should arise who knows not Joseph.' We must now say some
  loving words to our mother, Mrs. Cowie. She has been brave in
  coming to Maori kaingas and taking an interest in our wives and
  children. Greetings to you, Mrs. Cowie, our kind mother. Go in
  peace, and do not forget these your children. These are also
  some parting words to your children. They too are our relations,
  because they were born here. Go, our children, along with our
  common parents. Finally, sire, go and take with you the love
  of the Maories of the diocese. May Jehovah cover you all with
  His feathers and hide you under His wings. May the Great Shepherd
  of the sheep bless you and keep you while on the sea, and bring
  you back in peace and health. Such is our hope and prayer. Although
  this farewell is signed by us ministers only, it is from all
  the people of the Maori Church.--From your loving Maori children
  in Christ."</p>
<p>The address was read by the Rev. W. te Paa, my Maori chaplain,
  clergyman of the Waimamakii district, near Hokianga. Near him
  stood the Revs. Heta Tara-whiti, W. Turipona, M. Kapa, W. Hoete,
  H. Taitimu, H. Papahia, H. R. Hukatere, and H. N. Paerata. Afterwards
  they all shook hands with us, and departed. I was very sorry
  to say good-bye to them, even with the prospect of seeing them
  again before the end of twelve months.</p>
<p>December 28, Wednesday.--I went to Coromandel by the S.S.
  <i>Coromandel</i>, a small craft of about fifty tons. It was
  a brilliant day, with a strong breeze from the [289/290] south-west.
  The route from Auckland is very beautiful and interesting, first
  through a stretch of about twenty-five miles of sea sheltered
  from the ocean by a series of picturesque islands, the perfection
  of water for yachting. After dropping passengers at three of
  the beautiful bays of Waiheke Island, we emerged into the Hauraki
  Gulf, which--about fourteen miles--we crossed, with a strong
  south-west breeze behind us, reaching Coromandel about 5.30 p.m.
  The settlement was so named from one of H.M.'s ships, which visited
  the peninsula in the early days of the colony.</p>
<p>On landing I was kindly received by the Rev. Alexander English,
  clergyman of the district, Mr. Woollams, my host, Mr. Carnell,
  and Mr. J. Wilsen. Mr. English came to New Zealand from Ireland,
  where he had been a Wesleyan minister, in 1884. He was admitted
  to Deacon's Orders by me in 1886. His charge comprises an extensive
  district of hilly country, abounding in beautiful scenery, and
  the island of Waiheke, about fifteen miles distant. The wharf
  at Coromandel is about a mile distant from the township, and
  the omnibus by which passengers travel between them seems to
  be very near the end of its existence. I was hospitably received
  by Mr. Woollams, who lives in the township. In addition to other
  attractions, the house contains many interesting mementoes of
  Mr. Woollams' recent visit to England, among the chief of which
  are books of photographs, and other beautiful pictures, of historical
  places and famous paintings.</p>
<p>At 7.30 p.m. there was a Confirmation service in the church
  of the settlement, Christ Church, which was built in 1873, on
  land given to us by an old Maori chief, Pita [290/291] by name,
  whose grave is close to the building. There was a good congregation;
  but it would have been larger, if the service had been held at
  a later hour--after people had had time to get home from work,
  have their tea, and "tidy themselves." I was assisted
  by Mr. English. The harmonium was played by Miss Boyd, who has
  for many years been the zealous and efficient volunteer organist
  of the church. Before the service I presented lay readers' licences
  to Mr. C. H. Bennett and Mr. J. Carnell. The church has been
  restored recently, and has had two smaller windows--the gift
  of Mr. Woollams--substituted for the large one in the west end;
  by which change the strength of the building has been much increased,
  as it needed to be, to withstand the force of the south-west
  wind which comes in from the sea at this point. The whole of
  the interior of the building has been suitably painted.</p>
<p>Coromandel has experienced the usual ups and downs of a gold-field
  since I first visited it in 1870, when gold was being obtained
  from quartz reefs high up on the Tokatea range. Some years afterwards,
  there was a great and rapid increase of population there, in
  consequence of the reputed abundance of the precious metal that
  had been found near the sea in the harbour. As an instance of
  the speculative spirit that existed, I may mention the fact that
  £500 was paid to the trustees of a small piece of Church
  land in the neighbourhood, for the exclusive right of mining
  there during a period of fourteen years. There was much roguery
  practised in connection with the Beach mines, and much money
  was lost there by confiding people. For some years afterwards
  the population of Coromandel steadily [291/292] diminished, and
  many of the buildings in its one street were unoccupied, and
  allowed to go to ruin. Recently the working of the principal
  mines of the district has been taken up by English companies,
  whose expenses are said already to be paid by the gold obtained.
  The ordinary wages of men working for the companies are eight
  shillings a day; and I was told that other day-labourers in the
  district expect to receive this rate of pay for eight hours'
  work.</p>
<p>Mr. Woollams, my host, has been a principal shareholder in
  some of the mines for many years. He has also been a Church officer
  since Christ Church was erected, and has been a member of several
  Diocesan Synods. A strong south-west wind was blowing from the
  time I left Auckland until my return on the following day. Unlike
  many New Zealanders, Mr. Woollams is not afraid of fresh air,
  and keeps his windows open at this season of the year, inhaling
  the health-giving breeze that comes to him fresh from the sea.
  It is sometimes as much as I can do to remain in the houses of
  some of my friends, who carefully shut every window and door
  of their rooms, even in summer, and when the rooms are small
  and full of people. In such cases I almost invariably notice
  that members of the household are sickly, and that the climate
  is said to disagree with them. In the Auckland province, the
  more people live out-of-doors--in a verandah, or, at all events,
  with open windows--between November and March, the better health
  will they enjoy. Among others who complain of our climate are
  men and women, of all sections of the community, who drink quantities
  of tea at all times of the day; and men who are slaves to tobacco,
  smoking morning, noon, [292/293] and night. These persons not
  only themselves suffer much--from dyspepsia--but inflict much
  suffering on others, by their ill-temper and frequent unfitness
  for their duty, and general complainings of being overworked.</p>
<p>December 29, Thursday.--I returned, by the S.S. <i>Coromandel</i>,
  to Auckland. The sun was bright, the south-west breeze--a head
  wind to us--very strong, and the sea covered with white-crested
  waves. A more exhilarating trip cannot be imagined. The little
  steamer, of which Mr. Scott is the trustworthy skipper, though
  a great roller--owing to its heavy topgear--in a beam sea, is
  very steady when the wind is straight ahead, as it was on this
  occasion. As it was low water at Coromandel when we left, I had
  to go from the wharf to the steamer, which was at anchor about
  half a mile distant, in a boat. I was rowed by my old friend,
  Mr. J. Wilsen, a Prussian by birth, in his safe little craft,
  the <i>Result</i>.</p>
<p>December 30, Friday.--The brilliant sunshine and cool south-west
  wind, day after day, of our Christmas season have been most favourable
  to holiday-makers; and in Auckland almost all the population
  may be classed in this category.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we spent a couple of hours at the house
  of Mr. H. G. Seth Smith, in Victoria Avenue, Remuera. The house
  and grounds are a good specimen of what can be done in a short
  time in our Auckland climate, even without the expenditure of
  much money. The house, which is built of kauri pine, was designed
  by Mr. Alfred Smith, the architect of the Army and Navy Club,
  Pall Mall, who resided in Auckland for a short time for the benefit
  of his health. During his sojourn [293/294] among us he designed
  other buildings also, which bear the marks of a master hand,
  and are an ornament to our city, especially that of which the
  Victoria Arcade forms a part. Mr. Seth Smith's estate, comprising
  only a few acres, in one of our Auckland suburbs, is already
  a very attractive place, with its sunny aspect and openness to
  our cool south-west breezes. Indeed, the house gets more of these
  breezes at present than is desirable; but protecting screens
  of <i>insignis</i> and other pines, not to mention the blue and
  red eucalyptus, can be grown in the course of a very few years
  in Auckland. Where there was only a rough paddock four years
  ago, Mr. Smith has now his lawns, flower-beds, kitchen garden,
  and orchard--containing well-grown fig-trees, besides lemons,
  apples, and pears. At his house this afternoon we met several
  friends, who had come by invitation to bid us good-bye. Among
  others were Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Wilson, who themselves have a
  very beautiful home in the neighbourhood, on a site overlooking
  the eastern part of the harbour. Mr. Wilson is one of the proprietors
  of the Herald, our principal morning newspaper, and is a leading
  member of the Wesleyan Methodists of Auckland. Both he and Mrs.
  Wilson are liberal supporters of Christian work, and are always
  ready to help--personally and with their money--any benevolent
  and deserving object.</p>
<p>In the evening, we went to Otahuhu, where I held a Confirmation.
  That rite was administered here only six months ago; but, with
  the prospect of a long interval before the Bishop can be here
  again, the Rev. F. Gould wisely decided to present to me, before
  my departure, [294/295] the fourteen candidates he had already
  on his list. This is, we believe, our last journey in the diocese
  before quitting it for England. Since December 1 I have travelled
  about 850 miles, holding Confirmations, in most cases additional
  ones--a sort of gleaning after the harvest.</p>
<p>December 31, Saturday.--After twelve we rode out to Alberton
  (about six miles), the estate of Mr. A. K. Taylor, comprising
  many acres of volcanic land in the Mount Albert district--some
  of it a mass of rocks and stones, but much in an arable condition,
  and indeed growing trees, grass, shrubs, and flowers in great
  luxuriance. Like the owners of the land in England of old, Mr.
  Taylor gave the church site (S. Lukes), and contributed largely
  to the erection, and subsequently to the enlargement, of the
  building. He has been a member of our Diocesan Synod for many
  years.</p>
<p>In time there will doubtless be a large population resident
  on the Alberton land, attracted not only by its accessibility
  from Auckland, but also by the nature of the soil, which, being
  dry and porous, is specially beneficial to persons who suffer
  from throat and lung diseases when living on a clay soil. At
  the back of the Alberton house is a high and picturesque hill,
  called Mount Albert, formed of an extinct crater, from which
  the district is named.</p>
<p>This afternoon, H.M.'s ships <i>Calliope </i>and <i>Raven
  </i>arrived from Sydney and Lyttelton respectively, making the
  number of men-of-war in our harbour five.</p>
<p>January 1, 1888.--In the morning, we went to Onehunga (about
  six miles), the port on the other [295/296] side--the west--of
  the isthmus on which Auckland stands, and from which our city
  has been called "the Corinth of the South." At the
  eleven a.m. service I held a Confirmation. The candidates were
  presented by the Incumbent of S. Peter's, the Rev. W. E. Mulgan,
  who was a Senior Moderator in Classics at Trinity College, Dublin,
  in 1840. Mr. Mulgan came to the diocese in 1875 from the disestablished
  Church of Ireland, and began his New Zealand life as a settler
  at Katikati. During part of his sojourn there he ministered in
  holy things to his fellow-settlers, and to our people at Paeroa
  and Waitckauri, which places are a long day's ride from Uritara,
  where Mr. Mulgan's farm was situated. In 1878, Mr. Mulgan was
  instituted by me to the incumbency of S. Peter's, Onehunga; and
  he has now for nearly ten years ministered to the people of that
  parish, with great advantage to them, and has during that period
  done much valuable work for our Church College of .S". John
  and Church Grammar School, as examiner of the latter, and for
  some time as a tutor of the former. Mr. Mulgan's predecessor
  at S. Peter s was my old friend and coadjutor and quondam chaplain,
  the Rev. A. R. Tomlinson, now Rector of S. Michael's, Penkevil,
  Cornwall, and my senior commissary in England. Mr. Tomlinson
  was ordained to one of the curacies of S. Mary's, Stafford, in
  1867, when I was rector of that parish. In 1874, he came to New
  Zealand, where he remained until 1878. During his sojourn in
  this diocese he was one of my chaplains, and he did much good
  work in ministering to settlers in the outlying districts, where
  his visits are still remembered with real gratitude. We are indebted
  to [296/297] him for some of the most efficient of our junior
  clergy, who were selected by him in England, at the request of
  our Board of Nominators, with my approval. As an instance of
  the steadfastness of my excellent commissary, I may here record
  the fact that since his departure from New Zealand in 1878, he
  has written to me regularly every month by the San Francisco
  mail.</p>
<p>In the morning, I preached at S. Paul's.</p>
<p>January 2, Monday.--E. was presented with a beautiful silver
  salver, accompanied by the following-letter:--"Dear Mrs.
  Cowie,--Will you kindly accept this little gift from 'Auckland
  Women,' not as a measure of our love and respect, but in slight
  recognition of your many kindnesses and untiring labours among
  us." Signed by members of the Committee, namely, A. Bates,
  Lucy Calder, S. F. Clarke, Marion Dudley, A Davis, M. Hamilton,
  M. J. Heywood, A. Maunsell, G. S. Nelson, F. O'Callaghan, Gertrude
  Richards, Mary Tebbs, M. J. Rawlings, J. A. Judd, M. H. Walpole.
  The salver bears the following inscription: "Mrs. Cowie,
  in loving recognition of her work among us, from Auckland Women.--January,
  1888." There were five hundred subscribers, we were told.
  Afterwards, the balance of subscriptions, £13 15<i>s</i>.
  6<i>d</i>., was sent to E. by Mrs. Rawlings. [January 9]</p>
<p>January 3, 4, and 5.--Days of packing up and saying good-bye.
  Among those of whom we took leave were Mrs. Lush, the widow of
  the late Archdeacon of the Waikato, and her daughter, now residing
  in S. Mary's parish, Parnell. Mrs. Lush is one of those on whose
  sympathy and help we can always depend in works of [297/298]
  charity; and Miss Lush has always been among the clergyman's
  best coadjutors in Sunday-school work, wherever her home has
  been.</p>
<p>January 6.--I had a final interview with those who were to
  be ordained on the 8th. It is to a Bishop an occasion of devout
  thanksgiving when he has such hope of those on whom he is about
  to "lay hands," as I have of C. A. Tobin--to be ordained
  a Priest, and C. Cockerton--to be made a Deacon.</p>
<p>In the evening, I held a Confirmation at the Church of the
  Epiphany. Before the last hymn, I presented a lay reader's licence
  to Mr. J. W. Tibbs. On our way to the church, we paid some visits
  of adieu. One was to Madame Outhwaite, a French lady, and her
  daughters, who are amongst our oldest Auckland friends. Miss
  Isa Outhwaite is an accomplished artist, and has given us, as
  a parting gift, a beautiful painting, done by herself, of the
  lovely view from our balcony at Bishopscourt. We also visited
  the grave of Mr. W. S. Gardner in the Auckland Cemetery. Mr.
  Gardner was a son of the churchwarden at Moulton, where E.'s
  home was and I was curate in 1855-57. He died of dysentery in
  1883, and his widow returned to England.</p>
<p>After the Epiphany service, we went to the Sailors' Home,
  at about 9.30 p.m., and were glad to find everything going on
  satisfactorily, so far as we could judge by appearances.</p>
<p>January 7.--The weather for the last few weeks has been quite
  perfect--perpetual sunshine by day, with nights of brilliant
  starlight; the warmth of the air being tempered by cool south-west
  breezes and occasional [298/299] showers at night. One cannot
  imagine anything more perfect in climate. Auckland is famous
  for its strawberries. This year they have been exceptionally
  abundant, large and well-flavoured. Five or six tons a day of
  this wholesome fruit are said to be sold to the citizens. Much
  of it is grown at Northcote, on the north side of our harbour.
  To-day I paid for our tickets by the Peninsular and Oriental
  Company to London, including the passage to Sydney by the New
  Zealand Union Steamship Company. A deduction was made, in consideration
  of my going "on duty" to the Lambeth Conference, and
  of the largeness of our party--six in all. For three first-class
  tickets--for ourselves and a daughter--we paid £169, and
  for three second-class--for our sons--£93. [At Melbourne
  we paid an additional £20, to enable our sons to travel
  first-class, as they felt it irksome being restricted to one
  part of the deck.] When we came to New Zealand, eighteen years
  ago, E. and I paid £119 10<i>s</i>. each for the passage
  from Marseilles to Melbourne only. Such has been the reduction
  in the cost of travelling in these years; and the improvement
  in speed and comfort is in inverse proportion.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Rev. E. J. Phillips brought to me the
  gleanings of his Confirmation candidates, a young man and a young
  woman, who had been unavoidably absent when the rite was administered
  at S. Alban's recently--to receive the Laying on of Hands in
  the private chapel.</p>
<p>January 8, Sunday.--One of our family anniversaries, on which
  I was specially thankful to hold an Ordination, and the more
  so because it was to be my last Sunday in Auckland for a long
  time. It is almost unnecessary to [299/300] say that the day
  was fine. The service was at All Saints', where the incumbent,
  the Rev. W. Calder, one of my chaplains, had taken great pains,
  as usual, to have everything as well ordered as possible.</p>
<p>Before the service, I visited the parish Sunday school. I
  had received a hint that something kind, by way of farewell,
  was to be said to me by the children; but I was quite unprepared
  for what actually took place. Mr. Calder, in words affectionate
  and too kind, spoke of the interest I had taken in the school,
  and said that the children would thank me for themselves. Thereupon
  they all rose, and sang, to the tune familiar to all, the following
  verses, which, we afterwards heard, were the composition of Mrs.
  Calder:--</p>
<p><center>"FAREWELL TO OUR BISHOP.</center></p>
<p>"When we heard that you were leaving,<br/>
  When we heard 'twas all too true,<br/>
  Then we said, 'While deeply grieving,<br/>
  We will try what we can do,<br/>
  Just to show him that his efforts<br/>
  For his schools are not in vain,<br/>
  And we'll "learn and labour truly"<br/>
  Till he come to us again.<br/>
  Late and early has he labour'd,<br/>
  Setting questions, making rules;<br/>
  Hard it was to find the leisure<br/>
  Needed for his Sunday Schools.<br/>
  Many "Prizes" has he giv'n us--<br/>
  Best encouragement was this;<br/>
  Now we'll turn the tables on him,<br/>
  And we'll give the Bishop his.'<br/>
  So, dear Bishop, on your birthday,<br/>
  May your All Saints' children prove<br/>
  How your efforts for our welfare<br/>
  Have inspired our warmest love?<br/>
  May we ask your kind acceptance<br/>
  Of this gift, though poor its size?<br/>
  [301] For you've been our kindest Bishop,<br/>
  And you've won our 'Bishop's Prize'<br/>
  May God's Holy Spirit's blessing<br/>
  Keep you till you come again;<br/>
  This your All Saints' children pray for,<br/>
  In the name of Christ. Amen.</p>
<p>"All Saints' Sunday School, Auckland,<br/>
  "January 8, 1888."</p>
<p>The prizes referred to were the Bishop's Prizes given by me
  annually to scholars and teachers of our Sunday schools. One
  of the scholars handed to me a copy of the verses very prettily
  illuminated (the work of a parishioner), with a border of forget-me-nots
  and a Bishop's crook. After the singing, another scholar presented
  to me a handsome and substantial black-leather bag, of New Zealand
  make, with a small gilt plate affixed, bearing the following
  inscription, surmounted by a mitre:--"W. G. Auckland, his
  Bishop's Prize, from 'the least of All Saints',' 8th January,
  1888."</p>
<p>The Ordination was at eleven a.m.; Morning Prayer having been
  said at an earlier hour. I preached the sermon. At the Laying
  on of Hands, I had with me the Archdeacon, the Warden of S. Johns
  College, the Rev. A. G. Purchas, and the Rev. W. Calder. At the
  church door we took leave of some of our oldest New Zealand friends--among
  others, Mrs. Kenny, the widow of Colonel Kenny, formerly a member
  of the Legislative Council, and her daughter, Miss Kenny, who,
  as long as her health was good, was one of our most zealous Sunday-school
  teachers, and an ever-willing helper in al good works.</p>
<p>In the evening, I preached at S. Mary's, my last [301/302]
  sermon before leaving for England. Prayers were said by the Revs.
  G. H. S. Walpole and W. Beatty; the Lessons being read by Mr.
  H. G. Seth Smith, to whom I presented a lay reader's licence
  immediately before he went to the lectern to read. Mr. Smith's
  licence is the only one of the kind that I have ever issued,
  authorising the holder "to preach and interpret" in
  churches in which he is invited to do so by the clergyman in
  charge. The General Synod recognises the Bishop's authority to
  give such a licence to a qualified layman. [Resolution IX.] The
  memorial asking me to issue this special licence to Mr. Smith
  was signed by some of our principal clergy and laity, including
  Archdeacons Maunsell and Dudley, and Colonel Haultain.</p>
<p>January 9, Monday.--A day of adieus, and of wearisome packing--from
  4.30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Several friends called, to take leave of
  us; among others, our esteemed medical adviser, Dr. C. H. Haines.
  The doctor was formerly in the navy, but has now for many years
  practised in Auckland. He is considered one of the most skilful
  members of his profession in the colony; and from our personal
  experience of his powers of diagnosis, his attention to his patients,
  and his unvarying kindliness, we have formed the highest estimate
  of his worth. His decision of manner and economy of words help
  to confirm the impression otherwise formed of his ability and
  trustworthiness. Mrs. Haines, who is a member of the Auckland
  family of Isaacs, is a zealous worker in connection with our
  Benevolent Society.</p>
<p>January 10, Tuesday.--At 10.30 a.m. there was Holy Communion
  at S. Matthew's, a parting service. [302/303] The following clergy
  assisted me, namely, Archdeacons Dudley and Willis; the Revs.
  J. Bates, W. Beatty, W. Calder, C. M. Nelson, and T. H. Sprott--my
  chaplains; and the Rev. W. Tebbs, incumbent of the church. There
  were 151 communicants, including many more of the clergy and
  some of our senior laity. We said farewell to several dear friends
  at the church door.</p>
<p>At 4.45 p.m. we went on board the <i>Manapouri</i>, of the
  Union Steamship Company, which was to take us to Sydney. Many
  of the clergy, and a very large number of other friends, were
  on the ship and the wharf, to say goodbye. Several friends had
  brought flowers for our cabin; and one, the Rev. T. F. King,
  a box of delicious grapes, which were specially beneficial to
  E., in her chronic seasickness. My god-daughter, Marion Beatrice
  Devereux, had made for me a very convenient piece of work, consisting
  of a number of roomy pockets, to be suspended from a peg in our
  cabin, and to hold divers articles needed by a traveller. Mr.
  Brett, the proprietor of the Evening Star, had sent a large parcel
  of books, printed at his own press, containing useful information
  about the colony. Mrs. J. E. Macdonald and Miss Newby sent E.
  a very completely fitted-up cabin bag, and other useful presents.</p>
<p>The <i>Manapouri </i>left the Auckland wharf before 5.30 p.m.,
  amid cheers from the large assemblage, and the waving of handkerchiefs.
  We were all very sad at leaving. E. and I were more than sorry
  to quit our work, and our many dear friends, and very many respected
  coadjutors. We both felt, however, that it was our duty to go
  away for a time. Independently of the Archbishop of Canterbury's
  inviting me to the [303/304] Lambeth Conference--the occasion
  of our leaving, we were conscious of needing a change and rest
  after eighteen years of incessant work of body and mind. Moreover,
  our four children--the eldest going on for eighteen years--were
  at an age when it was most desirable that they should see something
  of the world, before deciding on their future occupation.</p>
<p>We left our house in charge of our friend Miss Maning, who
  was to live there with her faithful companion, Miss Green. We
  also left two caretakers--Georgina Cheer, in whom we have much
  confidence, to look after everything indoors; and John Hollingsworth,
  of whom it is enough to say that he has been with us more than
  seventeen years, to take care of our horses and the grounds.</p>
<p>January II, Wednesday.--We reached Opua, in the Bay of Islands,
  early in the morning. Here the Mana-pouri remained until eleven
  a.m., taking in coals brought by train (about seven miles) from
  the Kawakawa mine. At Opua several friends met us, to take leave;
  among others, the Rev. Philip Walsh, my chaplain, who brought
  me a very clever and spirited drawing of our party on the road
  from Waimate to Kaeo on April 27 last; the Rev. T. P. N. Hewlett,
  on his periodical visit to the district; our old friend Mrs.
  Ford, from Russell; and Mr. J. Williams, of Pakaraka.</p>
<p>At eleven a.m. we left Opua and the land of New Zealand. The
  Manapouri is a vessel of about seventeen hundred tons, with engines
  of about the same number of horse-power, and is provided with
  the electric light and other modern improvements. The captain
  is Mr. [304/305] Thomas Logan, formerly of the <i>Hero</i>, a
  vessel of about eight hundred tons, which was for many years
  the principal steamer trading between Auckland and Sydney. Captain
  Logan is a great favourite with Auckland people, and is known
  to be one of the most careful of the skippers of the Union Company.
  He is, moreover, a God-fearing man, and when at sea on Sundays,
  in the absence of a clergyman, conducts public worship in a manner
  reverent and edifying; but he gladly avails himself of the help
  of a clergyman, when there is one among the passengers sufficiently
  well to preach.</p>
<p>We left the Bay of Islands with a fresh easterly breeze, which
  increased as we went on. After passing the North Cape at about
  six p.m., the wind was nearly aft, and we made good progress.
  New Zealand was being left behind as the sun was setting; and
  the children felt that they could adopt the words of Childe Harold
  under similar circumstances--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yon sun that sets upon the sea<br/>
    We follow in his flight;<br/>
    Farewell awhile to him and thee,<br/>
    My native land, good-night."</p></blockquote>
<p>We leave New Zealand at a very critical time. In consequence
  chiefly of the large colonial debt, the taxation of the people
  is very high. Much of the money that has been borrowed by the
  Government during the last twelve years has been spent on works
  that yield no revenue, and are not likely to yield any for some
  time to come; and whilst that money was being expended, large
  numbers of people acquired expensive habits of living, which
  it is difficult for them to alter. The natural resources of the
  country are, however, so great that none [305/306] but superficial
  observers can doubt that, with economy on the part of Government
  and of the people generally, New Zealand will in time be as prosperous
  as ever. One of the chief attractions of the colony is its climate,
  which, as Bishop Barry says, "is the climate of England
  glorified;" and with that chief source of health and happiness
  to the whole population, the mismanagement of financial matters
  on the part of the Government, fortunately, cannot interfere.</p>
<p>In my recent tours of visitation through a great part of the
  North Island, I have been told almost everywhere that the necessaries
  of life are to be had in abundance by all healthy, industrious,
  and honest people; and it is commonly said, by well-informed
  persons, that employment, with more than mere maintenance, could
  be obtained in country districts by many of those who say that
  they stand idle in our towns because no man hath hired them,
  but who will not leave the attractions of larger communities.
  In reference to Auckland, I can sincerely adopt the words of
  Sir John Lubbock, spoken of England recently--"On the whole,
  I believe there never was a time when modest merit and patient
  industry were more sure of reward."</p>
<p>January 12 and 13 were perfect days. The east wind continued
  to blow fresh, straight behind us, and the sea had many white-crested
  waves. Most of the passengers began to recover from their sea-sickness,
  but E. continued miserable and helpless. During the voyage she
  was much indebted to Mr. Courtney, of Ponsonby, Auckland, for
  an abundant supply of delicious grapes, grown by him under glass,
  and for some fine lemons, also from his own garden.</p>
<p>[307] January 14, Saturday.--The wind changed to the north-east,
  but the sea was smooth, and we made good progress.</p>
<p>January 15, Sunday.--We reached Sydney before nine a.m. At
  eleven, we went to the cathedral, of which the acoustic properties
  are so defective that many of the prayers were quite inaudible
  to all our party, half-way down the nave. The Primate (Bishop
  Barry) preached. In speaking of the part that each Christian
  was bound to take in the manifestation of the glory of Jesus
  Christ, he referred to the trouble of mind that many earnest
  Christians cause themselves by forgetting that they are not responsible
  for the "saving" of men's souls, but for this work
  of personal manifestation by word and deed. There was a good
  congregation. We thus experienced one of the benefits of a cathedral.
  We felt that we were not intruders; that we were not occupying
  the places of other individuals having an exclusive right to
  them; before entering the building we felt sure that the service
  would be such as we could join in with pleasure, that is, that
  the worship would not be marred by any parochial peculiarity,
  and that the sermon would be the teaching of one of the more
  gifted preachers of the diocese. The grandeur of the building,
  moreover, with its many tokens of the pious munificence of its
  builders and adorners, added not a little to the great happiness
  it was to us to offer our thanksgiving in the Sydney Cathedral.</p>
<p>In the evening, at 7.30 (the summer hour of service), we were
  at the cathedral again. There was a very large congregation.
  We sat a little to the west of the south transept in the aisle,
  where we heard without effort [307/308] every word of the prayers,
  lessons, and sermon. The whole service was taken by the Rev.
  E. C. Beck, whose voice was clear and well sustained. The Sydney
  Cathedral has a small district attached to it, in which the Dean
  and his coadjutors have the cure of souls.</p>
<p>The ordinary revenue of the cathedral is about £2500,
  of which sum about £1500 is received as the ordinary offertory
  collections. The Dean is at present absent in England. The appointment
  to this office is made by the Bishop.</p>
<p>A very beautiful reredos of alabaster has recently been erected
  in the cathedral. The central panel represents the Crucifixion.
  Some earnest people objected to this part of the sculpture; and,
  for the sake of peace, the cathedral authorities agreed to substitute
  for the offending panel another, representing the Transfiguration,
  for which the objectors provided the necessary funds--£140.
  It is strange that people should object to representations of
  our Lord in stone, but not in painted glass. One is reminded
  by their state of mind of certain members of the Greek Church,
  who were scandalized by some of Titian's paintings, on account
  of their lifelikcncss. "We might as well have images,"
  they complained; images, but not paintings, being disallowed
  in the Greek Church.</p>
<p>January 16, Monday.--We transhipped all our baggage from the
  <i>Manapouri </i>to the <i>Valetta</i>, a vessel of 4919 tons,
  of the Peninsular and Oriental Company. The engines of the vessel
  weigh nineteen hundred tons. On the coast of Australia about
  seventy-seven tons of coal a day are consumed. The company are
  said to have lost £85,000 last year by their Australian
  trade. It was an oppressively hot day in Sydney, with clouds
  [308/309] of dust. The hotel charges seemed to us extravagantly
  high. We were struck by the absence of four-wheeled conveyances
  from the streets, <i>hansoms </i>being the vehicles almost exclusively
  in general use.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, our whole party went out, by tram-car most
  of the way, to Bishopscourt, in the suburb of Coogee Bay. Bishopscourt
  stands on a Church estate of about sixty acres, and overlooks
  the sea. It is a good house, having been improved and added to
  by the present Bishop, but is inconveniently distant from Sydney,
  namely, about six miles. Mrs. Barry is living in England, for
  the benefit of her health. Her two sons are also there for educational
  purposes. Our day ended with a short service in the Bishop's
  chapel, at which our son Edmund acted as organist. The cautions
  we have received not to walk through long grass, lest we should
  tread on snakes, help us to realise some of the advantages of
  life in New Zealand compared with Australia. There we can walk
  anywhere, by day or night, without any fear of snakes or other
  noxious creatures, which in New Zealand are non-existent.</p>
<p>January 17 and 18.--These days were spent by us in rest and
  quiet at Bishopscourt. The Primate (Bishop Barry) is a very hard
  worker, rising early and late taking rest. During our stay at
  his house he went into Sydney daily to his registry, for the
  transaction of business, diocesan and of other kinds. At the
  present time he is much engaged in making arrangements for the
  coming observance of the Centenary of the colony of New South
  Wales, and of the Church of Australia; Captain Phillip, the first
  Governor of the colony, having entered the port on January 26,
  1788, for the purpose of [309/310] establishing a depot for criminals.
  Wherever I go, I hear the Primate spoken of with the greatest
  reverence, and described as <i>facile princeps</i> among the
  able men of the colony, and among those most devoted to its advancement
  in matters religious, moral, intellectual, and social. We very
  much enjoyed our intercourse with him at Bishopscourt during
  our four days' sojourn there, and esteemed it a great privilege
  to see so much of him, and have such opportunities of speaking
  to him unreservedly on many subjects.</p>
<p>January 19.--We went to Government House at five p.m., to
  afternoon tea, and had some conversation with the Governor and
  Lady Carrington. We met there Lord and Lady Carnarvon, who were
  staying with the Governor.</p>
<p>January 20.--We left Bishopscourt, and took up our residence
  at the Hyde Park Hotel, where we were made very comfortable.
  On our way we called to see Canon Allwood, now eighty-five years
  of age, and living in retirement. On our arrival here in January,
  1870, from England, on our way to Auckland, we were kindly received
  by the Canon and Mrs. Allwood, in the absence of the Bishop,
  and were hospitised by them during our stay.</p>
<p>January 21.--Much of this day was spent in making final purchases
  of clothing, and in other preparations for our voyage to England.</p>
<p>We had luncheon at Mount Adelaide, the home of Mr. H. Mort.
  The site is remarkably fine, overlooking the bay, and the house
  is one of the finest and best appointed that I have seen since
  I left England. Mr. Mort is a member of a large family, whose
  munificence [310/311] and public spirit have been of the greatest
  advantage to Sydney, and to the Church of the colony, during
  many years.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, under the guidance of Mr. Rolleston, whom
  we met at Mr. Mort's, we went to the North Shore, and visited
  our old friend, Mrs. Patrick Leslie, formerly of Wartle in the
  Waikato, New Zealand.</p>
<p>January 22, Sunday.--This was a great day in the Sydney churches,
  especially in the cathedral, being the Sunday for which a special
  form of prayer had been prepared by the Bishops of the province
  for the commemoration of the Centenary of the colony and of the
  Church of Australia. We went to the cathedral at 11 a.m., 3.1
  S p.m., and 7.30. At the first of these services I preached and
  was celebrant, and at the others I read the second Lesson. I
  took for my text Psalm exxii. 6--"O pray for the peace of
  Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee"--the prayer
  of the patriot and the Churchman. Owing to the much music of
  the service, it was almost 12.15 when I entered the pulpit--far
  too long a midday service in a climate like that of Sydney in
  January, in a badly ventilated building like the cathedral. Before
  beginning my sermon, I was in a state of distressing perspiration.
  As I preached from notes, I was able to shorten my discourse,
  which lasted thirteen minutes, to the relief of the congregation
  and myself. The substance of what I said was that a thanksgiving,
  to be worthy of the name, must be accompanied by resolutions
  of effort for continued progress in the right direction, and
  that, in their respective relations as citizens or Churchmen,
  the people of New South Wales should strive (1) to maintain the
  [311/312] unity of the Empire; and the unity of the Church--in
  the diocese, the province, and throughout the Anglican communion,
  to go no further; and (2) to legislate in the State, and in the
  Church, for the good of those who are to come after us, as well
  as for the present generation.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, at 3.15, there was a crowded congregation
  at the cathedral The Governor (Lord Carrington) and many of "the
  heads of the people" were there, and a number of military
  and volunteer officers in full uniform. A long procession of
  choir men and boys, and of clergy (about forty-five), followed
  by the Bishops of Riverina (Linton) and Auckland, preceded the
  Primate up the nave to the chancel, a processional hymn being
  sung. The Primate's pastoral staff was carried before him; and
  he held it in his left hand when he afterwards gave the blessing.
  The anthem, from Mozart's "Twelfth Mass," was sung
  with much effect, as was also the "Hallelujah Chorus"
  after the sermon. The Primate was, of course, the preacher; and
  the vigour with which he delivered himself during more than half
  an hour, showed him to be almost unaffected by the great heat
  of the day,--his rich, sonorous voice, rendering each word distinctly,
  reaching every part of the building. After the "Hallelujah
  Chorus," during which the collection was made--in bags--God
  save the Queen was sung lustily by the whole congregation with
  great spirit, in quite an affecting manner. The offerings were
  for the Cathedral Bell Fund.</p>
<p>In the evening, at 7.30--a reasonable time for a hot climate--there
  was a very large congregation. Evening Prayer was said by the
  precentor, the Rev. A. R. Rivers, a young Oxford M.A. with a
  capital voice for a [312/313] large building. The first Lesson
  was read by the Bishop of Riverina (Dr. Linton), who also preached
  the sermon, a discourse <i>ad plebem</i>, well suited to a miscellaneous
  congregation--plain, and abounding in good sense, tempered by
  irony and quiet humour. Whoever acted for this new diocese, in
  selecting the first Bishop, did a good work for it, and for the
  Church of Australia, in making the choice they did.</p>
<p>In addition to the Centenary Sermon in the cathedral in the
  afternoon, the Primate preached two other sermons to-day in town
  churches, in the morning and evening. His energy of body, as
  well as of mind, is the wonder of his clergy and people. They
  may well be proud of him, as they are. It is commonly said of
  him that he is never unprepared to speak, or to lecture, on any
  subject of general interest; and that what he says in public
  is not only better said than any one else present could say it,
  but also contains more that is worth listening to than docs any
  other speech made on the same occasion.</p>
<p>January 23, Monday.--We left Sydney at noon in the <i>Valetta</i>.
  The Primate and the Bishop of Riverina came to the vessel, to
  see us off.</p>
<p>January 25, Wednesday.--After a not unpleasant passage, against
  a strong head wind and through a heavy sea, we reached Melbourne
  (i.e. Williamstown, about nine and a half miles from the city)
  before ten a.m. We went by train to Melbourne, which was looking
  its best, with bright sunshine and a cool breeze. I was amazed
  at the progress the city had made since our last visit, eighteen
  years ago. It is difficult to realise the fact that a city of
  such dimensions, and [313/314] containing such fine streets and
  so many grand buildings, is not yet forty years old. I called
  at Bishopscourt, where we spent some pleasant days with the Bishop
  and Mrs. Perry, <i>en route</i> to New Zealand in January, 1870.
  On our way to Bishopscourt we passed through the Fitzroy Gardens,
  which are very shady; but the grateful shade was almost more
  than counterbalanced by the tormenting pertinacity of the mosquitoes,
  even at midday.</p>
<p>The Bishop (Dr. Goe) was away from home. We took up our quarters
  at the Cathedral Hotel, in Swans-ton Street, next to the cathedral,
  which is in course of building. We found this hotel clean and
  comfortable, and very moderate in charges. It is, moreover, very
  conveniently situated for a visitor, being near a railway station
  and several tram lines, and to the General Post Office.</p>
<p>We admired the cathedral, which is being built from Mr. Butterfield's
  designs. The situation, though not grand, is very central, which
  is more important. The Rev. Dr. Bromby, of J . Paul's parish,
  the senior brother of the late Bishop of Tasmania, showed me
  over the building.</p>
<p>In the evening, we walked about the city, threading our way
  among the crowds of well-dressed and orderly people who thronged
  the wide pavements. We were much disappointed at the dearness
  of the fruit which was exhibited in the windows of many shops,
  and of cooling beverages, e.g. sixpence for a tumbler of lemon-juice
  and iced water, just double what we paid in Sydney.</p>
<p>January 26, Thursday.--Centenary Day of Australia.</p>
<p>[315] At eleven a.m. there was service in S. James's Church.
  As the Bishop (Dr. Goe) was to preach, and we had to leave Melbourne
  at noon, I went to the vestry before the service, and shook hands
  with him. Like the Primate (Dr. Barry), Bishop Goe is very active
  in visiting all parts of his diocese.</p>
<p>I took a seat at the west end of the church, where I remained
  until the end of the Psalms, when I had to hurry off to the railway
  station. The church is a fine specimen of the Georgian era, small
  and very unecclesi-astical. The prayer-desk is like a second
  pulpit, facing the congregation, and well exalted; both structures
  having velvet hangings with yellow fringe. The floor is covered
  with pen-like pews with doors.</p>
<p>Canon Chace was in the chancel with the Bishop.</p>
<p>On entering the church I encountered a quondam parishioner
  of S. Mary's, Stafford, who was one of our ringers there. He
  was for a short time in Auckland some years ago, and is now a
  successful boot and shoemaker in Melbourne, and one of the ringers
  of S. James's.</p>
<p>We left Melbourne in the <i>Valetta </i>at one. The railway
  carriages in which we travelled to the wharf are a striking instance
  of the survival of the unfittest. The first-class carriages are
  built in compartments--each to hold eight persons, like those
  of the Great Western Railway of old, and are in every way suited
  to a cold climate; being constructed and lined with cloth in
  a manner to oppress one even to look at, with a hot wind blowing,
  and the thermometer above 80° in the shade. A hot wind was
  blowing at the time, making the climate very different to what
  it was on our arrival the day before.</p>
<p>[316] In the night, a west wind sprung up, and went on increasing.</p>
<p>January 27, Friday.--The west wind increased until it became
  a gale, which hindered us, and made the motion of the ship very
  unpleasant. The diameter of the <i>Valetta</i>'s propeller is
  twenty feet, and its pitch twenty-eight feet. In fair weather
  she steams thirteen and a half knots an hour, and with a strong
  breeze behind her has run nearly four hundred miles in twenty-four
  hours.</p>
<p>January 28, Saturday.--We reached Glenelg, the port of Adelaide,
  about six a.m., and the <i>Valetta </i>anchored in the offing,
  about a mile from the pier, to which we were conveyed, after
  breakfast, in a small steam launch, which was tossed about unpleasantly,
  though there was only a little wind. From the wharf we went to
  the city, about eight miles, by railway. We first visited the
  cathedral, which is about a mile distant from the centre of the
  city. Only the chancel, transepts, and the first arch of the
  nave are finished; but the west end is bricked up, and the building
  is used regularly. The style is Early Gothic, severely plain,
  but is wanting in grace. The building is evidently well cared
  for. When there, we saw a lady, Miss Barry, with pious hands
  ordering the Holy Table, and doing other reverent work. We had
  luncheon with the Bishop at one p.m. He and Mrs. Kennion are
  highly appreciated throughout the diocese; and in the country
  districts especially he has already effected much, by inducing
  his people to build many churches in thickly populated and poor
  districts. Bishopscourt here is a good house, built by Bishop
  Short--the library being an unusually fine room.</p>
<p>[317] We were struck by the width of the Adelaide streets,
  and the grandeur of some of the buildings. The trees generally
  seemed stunted and scorched. On the 26th, the thermometer reached
  104° in the shade in the city, but the morning of our visit
  was cloudy and comparatively cool. The grapes of Adelaide are
  famous, and are certainly good and cheap. The charge for them
  in most of the shops to-day was threepence a pound. The chief
  excitement at the time of our visit was in connection with the
  Broken Hill Silver Mines, of which the shares had risen rapidly
  from £16 to £305, we were told.</p>
<p>The Valetta took in more than a thousand tons of cargo at
  Glenelg, chiefly wool, with some copper, tin, and silver-lead.</p>
<p>January 29, Sunday.--We left Glenelg at one a.m., and made
  good progress during the day, with a strong fair breeze.</p>
<p>At 10.45 a-m I held service in the saloon. The congregation
  was small, owing to the increasing motion of the vessel. Our
  son Edmund acted as organist. The service lasted forty minutes,
  including a five minutes' sermon.</p>
<p>January 30 and 31.--We crossed the Great Bight of Australia
  in fine weather; the sea on the latter day being calm and beautifully
  blue, the sky also being cloudless during a great part of the
  day.</p>
<p>February 1.--We reached King George's Sound before seven a.m.,
  and anchored off the railway wharf now being constructed. With
  other passengers, we went ashore in a small steam launch, returning
  at noon, the time fixed for the departure of the <i>Valetta</i>.
  We were here eighteen years ago, on our way to New Zealand. It
  was [317/318] then a very desolate-looking place, with few inhabitants.
  Now there are many houses; and Albany is becoming a town of importance,
  mainly on account of the railway that is being made (and is to
  be completed next year), connecting this, the only harbour of
  South-West Australia, with Perth and the other chief settlements
  of the colony. We visited the little church, which is quite English-like;
  being built of stone, and having a tower, over which ivy is creeping.
  The present clergyman, the Rev. W. W. Johnson, has added a good
  chancel, and made other improvements in the building, during
  his fourteen years' incumbency.</p>
<p>On leaving the Sound we were favoured with a strong south-east
  wind, which enabled us to travel at the rate of about fifteen
  miles an hour. In the evening, we met the Victoria, the largest
  of the Peninsular and Oriental ships (her tonnage being 6268
  and horse-power 7000), on her ninth day out from Colombo. We
  passed Cape Leeuwin about midnight, with a strong easterly breeze.</p>
<p>February 4.--We entered the Tropic of Capricorn in long. 1040
  1' east, at 6.15 p.m., after three days of steady fair wind.</p>
<p>February 5, Sexagesiina Sunday.--A perfect day in the tropics.</p>
<p>Morning service in the saloon was at 10.45. There was a large
  congregation. The captain read the first Lesson. Mrs. Love, of
  the North Shore, Sydney, played the harmonium to the canticles
  and two hymns; and E., who had quite recovered from her sea-sickness,
  led the singing.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock, evening service was held in the [318/319]
  saloon. Mrs. Love played, and E. led again. The subject of my
  sermon in the morning was "The Fall of Man," and in
  the evening, "Prayer."</p>
<p>February 6, Monday.--As all had become accustomed to the movement
  of the ship, we began daily Morning Prayer in the saloon, at
  10.30. The opening hymn was led by E., without accompaniment.
  The trade wind failed us about 180 south; and a north-west breeze
  sprang up, and continued for several days. Between 120 and 40
  south we had rain squalls, and very close weather.</p>
<p>February 9.--In the evening, we met the north-east trade wind,
  with a refreshing temperature.</p>
<p>A well-selected Sports Committee has arranged for cricket-matches,
  tournaments of chess, etc., during the voyage, so that there
  is plenty of healthy exercise for body and mind daily. The committee
  consists of the chief officer (Mr. Hall), the Marquis of Drogheda,
  Mr. Alison, and Mr. A. B. Macdonald. Among the passengers there
  are several others who do much for the amusement of us all; especially
  the Earl of Buckinghamshire and Mr. McKarg, who also help us
  much with the singing at the services.</p>
<p>February 12, Sunday.--We reached Colombo early in the morning.
  Since the erection of the breakwater, the work of Sir John Coode,
  this port has become one of the safest in the Indian Ocean, having
  been formerly an open roadstead. The breakwater is 4212 feet
  long. On the two former occasions of my visiting this island,
  Point de Galle was the port at which the Peninsular and Oriental
  steamer called, namely, in December, 1857, and January, 1870.
  On the former of these occasions I [319/320] was on my way to
  India, to serve as an army chaplain; and the first piece of news
  that came to us on arriving at Ceylon was that General Havelock
  had died of dysentery at the Alumbagh, near Lucknow. To-day,
  the first news that we received was that my old acquaintance,
  Sir Henry Sumner Maine, the learned writer of "Ancient Law,"
  and recently the Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, was dead.
  Sir H. S. Maine was quite as distinguished as a jurist as Sir
  H. Havelock was as a soldier. As an exemplification of the saying
  that one half of the world knows little about the other half,
  even of their own countrymen, I may mention that, on my telling
  a fellow-passenger--a man of social position, and personally
  acquainted with many of the leading politicians of the day--that
  this distinguished man was dead, he asked me who Sir Henry Maine
  was--whether he was the superintendent of the London police!</p>
<p>We landed before ten a.m., and took up our quarters at the
  Grand Oriental Hotel, an extensive establishment, with a very
  fine dining-hall, close to the wharf. The charges at the hotel
  were, we thought, unreasonably high. A morning bath, for instance,
  was classed as a luxury and not a necessity, and charged for
  separately, ninepence; and an afternoon cup of tea, with a slice
  of bread-and-butter, was charged ninepence also.</p>
<p>Close to the hotel is an old dining-hall of the Dutch Government,
  now used as the Fort Church of S. Peter, in which the troops
  have service. The building is very airy, and has wide verandahs,
  and is very suitable folks present use: a great contrast with
  the unsuitable style of some of the other churches of Colombo--copies
  [320/321] of buildings erected in cold countries, in which windows
  and doors are meant to be shut on most days of the year. As we
  passed along the street on landing, H.M.'s 91st Highlanders were
  at service, which began at 9.30 a.m.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we drove to Christhurch Cathedral, nearly
  three miles distant, through a long bazaar, crowded with men,
  women, and children.</p>
<p>The Bishop and Mrs. Coplestone had left the island shortly
  before, for England and the Lambeth Conference. We heard from
  many people how much they were both missed.</p>
<p>We were kindly received by the Warden of -S'. Thomas's College,
  the Rev. E. F. Miller, and Mrs. Miller; their house being close
  to the cathedral. Mr. Miller is spoken of as a <i>bibliotheca
  ambulans</i>, for the extent and the variety of his information.
  The service was at five p.m., the usual hour for Evening Prayer
  in Ceylon. A choir of men and boys, in purple cassocks and very
  short surplices, preceded the clergy into the church. The Warden
  was assisted by his college coadjutor, the Rev. G. Arnot, and
  the Rev. H. C. Hancock, of whom the latter preached. I read the
  second Lesson. The congregation and the choir had the benefit
  of punkahs; but in the chancel, where I sat, there was none,
  nor was there much ventilation. The style of the building, Early
  Gothic, seems to me a survival of the unfittest for a climate
  like that of Ceylon, where every door and window should be wide
  open on most days of the year. The service was conducted in a
  reverent and edifying manner. The singing of the choir was very
  good, the voices of the boys (some of them of Dutch descent)
  [321/322] being sweet and cultivated. The singing men are gentlemen
  of Colombo, who give their services <i>gratis</i>. S. Thomas's
  College seems to be the most flourishing school of the colony
  for higher education. I was told that the Government schools
  were not able to hold their own beside the denominational institutions,
  and that, in consequence, the grant in aid system had been adopted,
  and had succeeded well, relieving the colony of unnecessary taxation.</p>
<p>February 13, Monday.--We hired a carriage, for which the charge
  was very small, and drove through the town and suburbs, which
  we found highly interesting. "Every prospect pleases"
  outside the city, the colours of sky, earth, and sea being very
  beautiful; and if "man is vile" in these regions, it
  is probably only in the sense in which S. Paul speaks of the
  human body as vile, that is, associated with humiliation.</p>
<p>The children of Colombo are the most persistent beggars I
  ever came across. They ran after our carriage for long distances,
  asking us for money, appealing to E. as "Mama Lady,"
  and to me as "Lord Captân."</p>
<p>I received a call from Brigade-Surgeon S. Archer, who was
  with the 101st Regiment at Umbeyla in 1863. He reminded me that
  during that campaign he used to give me a sign, by pre-arrangement,
  when I had preached for ten minutes to the European troops forming
  a hollow square, on a small plateau among the rocks in that Afghan
  country.</p>
<p>I called on General W. O. Lennox, of the Engineers, commanding
  the district. I had not seen him for nearly thirty years. In
  April, 1858, he was with the column to which I was also attached,
  on the march from [322/323] Lucknow to Bareilly, with the late
  Sir Robert Walpole. I remember a parade taking place one evening
  on the march, for the presentation of the Victoria Cross to the
  then Captain Lennox, who had shown distinguished bravery. I called
  also on Colonel G. Forbes-Robertson, commanding the 91st Highlanders,
  who was with the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders at Lucknow in 1858,
  and at Umbeyla in 1863, when I was a chaplain with the forces
  in the field on those campaigns. The officer commanding the artillery
  at Colombo was also a quondam brother-campaigner of mine, but
  I had not time to call on him.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we went to the Church Missionary Society
  station at Galle Face, about a mile from the Fort. We were kindly
  received by the Rev. E. T. Higgens, the senior clergyman of the
  Church Missionary Society mission in Ceylon. It is more than
  thirty years since he first came to the country. He showed us
  his church and school--for girls, day scholars. We saw also Mrs.
  and Miss Higgens.</p>
<p>In the evening, we dined with the Governor, Sir Arthur Hamilton-Gordon,
  who is more at home in a Crown colony than he was as Governor
  of New Zealand, inasmuch as here he can govern as well as reign.
  Queen's House, as the Governor's residence here is called, is
  well adapted to the climate. The drawing-room in particular is
  large and well ventilated, and protected from the direct rays
  of the sun. At one end of it Sir Arthur has partitioned off a
  space, with a light wooden screen, as a private chapel. Lady
  Hamilton-Gordon had recently returned from England, bringing
  back with her their daughter, who had been educated at home.</p>
<p>[324] The lady whom I took in to dinner was a Mrs. Cameron,
  who, with her husband, is occupying the Bishop's house during
  his absence.</p>
<p>February 14.--We left Colombo soon after noon for Aden. The
  <i>Valetta </i>during her stay took in nearly six hundred tons
  of coal, brought from Cardiff. The cargo received here consisted
  chiefly of Ceylon tea and coffee. The quantity of tea (expected
  next year to be 30,000,000 lb.) exported from this island increases
  as that of coffee diminishes. The Ceylon tea has a very delicate
  and pleasant flavour. It is sold for 2s. a pound in London. Other
  Peninsular and Oriental vessels from China and Calcutta had arrived
  since we did, namely, the <i>Peshawur </i>and <i>Rohilla</i>.
  From the former, several passengers were transhipped to the Valetta;
  among others, Bishop Hose, of Singapore, with his wife and three
  children. A lady had died of cholera on board the Rohilla a few
  days before, and the vessel was in quarantine when we left. Archdeacon
  Matthew, the Bishop's commissary, came on board the Valetta to
  see us. He is a brother of the recently consecrated Bishop of
  Lahore. Dr. Archer also took leave of us on the ship. The Archdeacon
  was accompanied by the Rev. O. Beven, of Dutch descent, the clergyman
  of S. Paul's, a suburban church. We admired and envied his suitable
  attire.</p>
<p>February 15.--Among other passengers who joined us at Colombo
  were the Rev. H. C. Hancock and Lieut. F. V. Jeffreys, R.E.,
  and Mr. C. J. Scott, who were a great accession to our society.</p>
<p>In the evening, we passed the island of Minnekoi, one of the
  Laccadive group, where the Peninsular and Oriental ship Colombo
  was wrecked in 1862. There is a light on [324/325] this island
  now, provided for by the Ceylon Government. The <i>Valetta </i>is
  charged £13, light dues, every time the vessel passes this
  island--a good investment for the safety of the Company's ships.</p>
<p>February 19, Sunday.--We have had a smooth sea the whole way
  from Colombo, with occasional light trade winds from the north-east
  and north. We passed the island of Socotra this afternoon, but
  did not sight it, our course being forty-five miles to the south
  of the island. Our morning service to-day (the First Sunday in
  Lent) was at 10.45. There was a large congregation. Bishop Hose
  said prayers, Mr. Hancock read the Lessons, and I preached. The
  singing of the canticles and hymns was hearty. In the evening,
  at 8.30, I said prayers, Mr. Hancock read the Lessons, and Bishop
  Hose preached. The sermon was on our Lord's temptation, and was
  very interesting and instructive.</p>
<p>February 21.--We reached Aden about seven a.m., and left again
  at 10.30. As I had been on shore on two former occasions, and
  there would not be time to visit the places of interest, I did
  not land. The <i>Valetta</i> draws too much water to be able
  to go near to the landing-place. A large Russian ship of war
  (with a formidable ram) and a small French warship were among
  the many steam vessels at anchor in the roadstead. The objects
  of the Russian seemed to be regarded with some suspicion. H.M.'s
  72nd Regiment were in tents near the beach, waiting for a transport
  to convey them to England. The 98th Regiment occupied the barracks.
  Soon after leaving Aden we met the Peninsular and Oriental vessel
  <i>Thames</i>, on her way to Aden, Bombay, Colombo, and China.
  About six p.m. we passed the [325/326] island of Perim, and entered
  the Red Sea. Nearly opposite to Perim, on the Arabian coast,
  the French Government are constructing formidable fortifications.</p>
<p>February 22.--We found the dreaded Red Sea very pleasant,
  with a fresh southerly breeze and smooth water.</p>
<p>February 23.--The wind changed to the north, and the temperature
  was quite cool. We passed Suakim at nine a.m. In the evening,
  E. was glad to wear a shawl.</p>
<p>February 24.--The thermometer in our cabin at seven a.m. was
  76°, less than in our dining-room at Bishopscourt this afternoon,
  probably. We passed out of the tropics at six a.m.</p>
<p>February 25.--During these two last days we have had a fresh
  northerly wind, making the temperature most pleasant. Early this
  morning we reached the Gulf of Suez, and before six p.m. we were
  anchored near the entrance to the Canal, which we entered before
  ten o'clock. The <i>Valetta</i> is provided with an electric-light
  apparatus for making everything near her visible, so that we
  were able to travel all night. Moreover, the moon was nearly
  at the full.</p>
<p>The canal dues paid by the <i>Valetta</i> each time of passing
  through the Canal amount to about £1300, ten francs being
  charged for every passenger and every ton of cargo. The Peninsular
  and Oriental Company pays about £200,000 a year in Canal
  dues for its fleet.</p>
<p>February 26, Sunday.--We reached Port Said before one p.m.
  Our morning service was at 10.45. Bishop Hose said prayers, the
  Rev. H. C. Hancock read the Lessons, and I preached. The first
  special Lesson was Exodus xiv. to v. 15, which was specially
  interesting, [326/327] as we crossed the route of Abraham. Mr.
  Duberly, from Singapore, played the chants and hymn tunes. In
  the evening, Bishop Hose preached a very interesting sermon.
  His subject was Abraham--for whom the common reverence of Christians
  and Mahomedans might, the Bishop thought, bring nearer to one
  another the followers of Jesus and of the Arabian prophet.</p>
<p>February 28.--We were detained at Port Said from the middle
  of the day on Sunday to nine a.m. on Tuesday (to-day), waiting
  for the Indian mail, brought from Bombay by the S.S. <i>Verona</i>.
  On the 27th, we took a stroll through the town, which has sprung
  up at Port Said since the opening of the Canal in 1869. There
  is a clergyman of our Church resident here, the Rev. F. W. A.
  Strange, but we did not see him. During our stay of twenty hours
  at the port, large steamers were continually arriving--day and
  night--from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. After coaling,
  they proceeded on their way. The process of coaling at Port Said
  is very rapid. It is done by coolies, who can throw a hundred
  tons into a ship in an hour. On one occasion, during the Egyptian
  campaign, eight hundred tons were put on board one of H.M.'s
  ships in less than four hours. The coolies ascend from the coal-barge
  by a broad plank, with baskets on their shoulders, and return
  by another plank, in unbroken succession.</p>
<p>We left for Brindisi at nine a.m., and soon met a westerly
  breeze, which increased to a gale during the night, making the
  motion of the ship very trying, the screw being much out of the
  water.</p>
<p>February 29.--The wind continued to blow from the west, and
  everybody found the air unpleasantly cold.</p>
<p>[328] In the evening, "the south wind blew softly"
  [Acts xxvii. 13, 14] as we "sailed close by Crete. But not
  long after there arose against the ship a tempestuous wind,"
  probably S. Paul's Euroclydon, which caused us to tumble about
  in a most unpleasant manner, notwithstanding our tonnage of five
  thousand and horse-power of three thousand. We were the better
  able to realize the predicament of the Apostle in his poor little
  craft; and, like him, in the darkness "we wished for the
  day." [Acts xxvii. 29]</p>
<p>March I.--We passed the snowy mountains of Southern Greece,
  and saw plainly the town of Navarino. About nine p.m. we passed
  the island of Zante, and afterwards had to contend against a
  strong head wind.</p>
<p>March 2.--We reached Brindisi before three p.m., in a violent
  northerly wind, bitterly cold. We visited the principal church,
  which we found very dirty and un-dusted. After strolling about
  the uninteresting town for an hour, we were glad to return to
  the ship. On account of the difficulty of moving a large ship
  in so small a harbour in the dark, the captain wisely resolved
  to remain at his moorings until the morning. [The <i>Valetta
  </i>measures 420 feet.]</p>
<p>March 3.--In the afternoon, we passed the snow-clad mountains
  of Calabria, the weather being fine and the sea smooth.</p>
<p>March 4, Sunday.--We saw Mount Etna, covered with snow, at
  6.30 a.m., and reached Malta before eleven, in a fierce westerly
  wind, which blew all day, with squalls of cold rain. We landed
  at eleven a.m., and, entering by [328/329] the gateway of Notre
  Dame, we walked through the city. We were too late for the morning
  service in any of the churches. The Duke of Edinburgh (in command
  of the Mediterranean Squadron) and the Duchess, the Marquis and
  Marchioness of Lorne, and Prince Louis of Battenberg (in command
  of a gunboat) were at Malta.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we saw the Church of S. John, in which are
  the graves of the Knights of Malta. Afternoon prayers were going
  on at the time of our visit. We were struck by the irreverence
  of the choir-boys, who seemed to be paying little attention to
  the service, but to be talking to one another about the few people
  scattered through the building. Indeed, there were few tokens
  of reverence in the bearing of any of the worshippers. We left
  Malta at six p.m., in a very stormy westerly wind, with a heavy
  sea.</p>
<p>March 5.--A day of raging wind and heavy sea.</p>
<p>March 6 and 7.--Calm days, with bright sunshine, and easterly
  wind.</p>
<p>March 8.--We reached Gibraltar about ten a.m., and stayed
  until one p.m. The weather was calm and genial. The Channel Fleet,
  under the command of Sir W. N. W. Hewett, was at anchor under
  shelter of the Rock. From the deck of the <i>Valetta </i>we saw
  three shots fired at a target from a 100-ton gun. We left Gibraltar
  with a fair easterly wind at one p.m.</p>
<p>March 9.--We passed Cape St. Vincent at four a.m. and Lisbon
  at noon, with a light west-south-west wind. Off the coast of
  Portugal we had an afternoon and night of heavy rolling.</p>
<p>March 10.--We passed Cape Finisterre at eight a.m., with an
  increasing breeze from the south-west, and a [329/330] heavy
  swell from the west. During the night the wind changed to the
  north-west, and increased in strength, causing the vessel to
  roll and lurch violently.</p>
<p>March 11.--We passed Ushant about noon, in a strong north-west
  gale, with a high disturbed sea. (We heard afterwards that such
  severe weather had not been experienced in the south-west of
  England for two years.) After a most unpleasant day, we reached
  Plymouth at 11.30 p.m., and anchored inside the breakwater.</p>
<p>March 12.--Early in the morning our letters were brought to
  us by the Peninsular and Oriental agent--several of them containing
  cordial invitations to the whole family to go direct from the
  ship to houses of friends, and take up our quarters there. The
  first friend to greet us in person was Miss Oxland, who came
  on board with her father, bringing E. a basket of beautiful lilies
  of the valley and maidenhair ferns, and some Devonshire cream.</p>
<p>After the departure of several of our fellow-passengers, who
  were to go on to London by rail, we left Plymouth at eight a.m.,
  in beautiful weather.</p>
<p>March 13.--We reached the Albert Docks before noon, in very
  cold, wintry weather; but England is our native land, and we
  love her still.</p>
<p>Our feelings are those of the voyagers of whom the Psalmist
  said--</p>
<p>"Then were they glad, because they were at rest; and
  so He brought them unto the haven where they would be."--Ps.
  cvii. 30.</p></blockquote>
