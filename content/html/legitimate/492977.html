We’re looking for who’s the better Buckeye.”"},{"_id":"JB6ZNSXTG5F5RBGYBORMZCOL5M","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"This distinction proved crucial in multiple bracket matchups, particularly when comparing players with impressive accolades to those with deeper Ohio connections. The conversation highlighted how representing the state itself often carries weight beyond mere statistics."},{"_id":"AQZYOFK2GNAFNA6L57VOYF3EGY","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"When discussing A.J. Hawk’s connection to Ohio compared to Ezekiel Elliott’s undeniable brilliance, Krajisnik observed: “A.J. Hawk, like, a lot of times when you see him on (The Pat McAfee Show), if they’re at Ohio Stadium, you know, the night before College Game Day or something like that, or even if he just wears Ohio State stuff, like on the broadcast in general, he is very quick to wear a shirt that says, you know, it’s just script Ohio as opposed to something specific Ohio State like that. That’s a guy who does represent the state in a very major way.”"},{"_id":"JBVLHOBF2JG5LMEMV7VAPVHQ64","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"This representation of Ohio itself – not just the university – emerged as a critical factor in the hosts’ evaluations. The podcast explored how players who grew up dreaming of being Buckeyes bring an additional dimension to their legacy that out-of-state recruits might lack, regardless of on-field accomplishments."},{"_id":"PBRFERGZZFEIPH3VB7BLS4A454","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"Sawyer became the prime example of this phenomenon, with the hosts repeatedly emphasizing his hometown hero status. As Means explained: “If you grew up in Ohio wanting to play college football one day and play for the Buckeyes, Jack Sawyer is literally you.”"},{"_id":"ZJYZXXFOMJE75OS26JGI3CHI5Q","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"The discussion delved into how this hometown connection creates a different level of investment and responsibility. When things went wrong – particularly during the recent difficult stretch against Michigan – Sawyer’s willingness to be the face of the program’s struggles added to his “Buckeye aura” rather than diminishing it."},{"_id":"LP5JJ4UMTBALPA2XFCFUMKF3OM","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"“Jack Sawyer was the player who said hand up. Like, I will take the brunt from the player side. Ryan Day is going to get criticism. I will be the player that gets criticism because I’m the Ohio kid. I understand this rivalry,” Means noted. “If you’re going to be a Buckeye, you better be one when you lose, too. And he was that, I guess.”"},{"_id":"BOSU6J32YJEIJCZ4G2WYQHULKU","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"This willingness to represent the program in both triumph and defeat ultimately became central to the podcast’s definition of what makes a Buckeye truly great – sometimes even more than championships, accolades, or statistical dominance."},{"_id":"GBGRVMO4LZEG3KFXCPK5QKBOEQ","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"The conversation challenges listeners to reconsider how they evaluate players in program history. Is the greatest Buckeye necessarily the one with the most impressive résumé? Or is it someone who most fully embodies what it means to represent Ohio State?"},{"_id":"AXGF237ZWVBFTDVJBNMTW36S7Q","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"For those who grew up dreaming of donning the scarlet and gray, the answer might be more emotional than statistical."},{"_id":"MFTOYMTFZVFDTCSWFUGUF3DJMI","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"Want to hear the full debate about what makes a true Buckeye great? The complete episode of Buckeye Talk dives deeper into these matchups and explores the criteria for Ohio State’s greatest players.

Ohio -- When it comes to legendary <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/osu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\">Ohio State football</a> moments, two plays sparked an absolute inferno on the latest Buckeye Talk podcast: Craig Krenzel’s “Holy Buckeye” fourth-down conversion against Purdue in 2002 and Jack Sawyer’s game-changing “Scoop and Sawyer” touchdown against Texas in the 2023 College Football Playoff."},{"_id":"LGTM6LEZAFHLTLLTF3DMF2X7WM","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"The debate erupted during a discussion of Ohio State’s “Greatest Buckeye” bracket, where Jack Sawyer (7th seed) faced off against Craig Krenzel (26th seed). While the hosts agreed Sawyer should advance, they violently disagreed about which iconic moment deserves more reverence."},{"_id":"WNJC4FOUFJEVHDXU6E7RDJBL5Q","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"“The only thing it’s a conversation about is the moment,” co-host Andrew Gillis explained. “There’s going to be a lot of people who will argue that Holy Buckeye is a bigger, more memorable play in Ohio State history than the Scoop and Sawyer, the Jack Sawyer touchdown. And that’s a totally fair point to make.”"},{"_id":"Q4JSBUDZIVFCHLLE3P4AK6QARU","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"That’s when co-host Stephen Means dropped a bomb that would make any Buckeye fan’s jaw hit the floor: “I have a hot take. I think Holy Buckeye is drastically overrated when we’re talking about moments.”"},{"_id":"37NNY3KUQFDRVB3M3OBHWN7ZFA","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"His reasoning? The play’s legendary status owes too much to broadcaster Brent Musburger’s iconic call. “If Brent Musburger doesn’t say Holy Buckeye, is it still talked about?” Means challenged. “That’s my point. So I’m not taking away from the play and how big of a deal it was to get the completion, but that’s not the first time we’ve seen a play like that in football.”"},{"_id":"TMOVJ6GDWRGZ5KUNLSXB6YFR2Q","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"By contrast, Means argued, “Jack Sawyer scooping score is all Jack. There was no Brent Musburger. Holy Buckeye. There was no ... Michael Jenkins helping him out. No, no, this is Jack Sawyer.

That’s all Jack.”"},{"_id":"LXUQWQY64FB4TPD4WATBDQHNG4","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"The context matters too. “Holy Buckeye” happened against Purdue, while “Scoop and Sawyer” occurred in a playoff semifinal against Texas, with the quarterback “who was supposed to be your quarterback” on the other side."},{"_id":"WPRVCM6J6FEQZO3PVZGGJZ7VLE","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"Perhaps most compelling was Krajisnik’s point about Sawyer’s legacy: “The context of the Scoop and Sawyer is his name’s not on here.

"},{"_id":"LLYLBCXLJRDRNDE4MSFR6UOUYE","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"This revelation emerged during the Buckeye Talk podcast’s unveiling of their “Greatest Buckeye” bracket, as Stephen Means, Stefan Krajisnik and Andrew Gillis realized that several current stars owe their place in program lore to this new playoff format."},{"_id":"TDQLOVBJR5CM7NIVPAHU3U7YFU","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"The discussion took a fascinating turn when Stefan Krajisnik pointed out how the playoff changed the narrative for Jack Sawyer, who ranked remarkably high at No. 7 in the bracket."},{"_id":"3WCKKTKWJ5DEVGFX5XRULOGDIE","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"“So it’s so fascinating thinking about this discussion in the current college football era because if it’s not the 12 team playoff, how does Jack Sawyer get remembered?” Krajisnik asked. “It’s not the pick against Michigan. It’s the fight after losing a fourth straight game against Michigan.”"},{"_id":"F522R3NRNRFUJAIMI5JJXHZNCU","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"This insight sparked a broader realization: the expanded playoff has created second-chance opportunities for players to redefine their legacies after Michigan losses—opportunities that players from previous eras never had."},{"_id":"ZASI25RWIBGMRGOTF2GFIZMTTQ","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"“If this were 2023 and we hadn’t started the 12 team playoff yet, do either one of them make the list? No,” Means said, referring to Sawyer and Emeka Egbuka, who made the bracket at #28. Both were key contributors to Ohio State’s 2024 national championship run, but that opportunity only existed because the 12-team format allowed the Buckeyes to make the playoff despite losing to Michigan."},{"_id":"QCU7F2UAL5BCRHQLDN7ARTK6KA","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"This new reality creates an intriguing contrast with past eras of Ohio State football, particularly the 1990s John Cooper teams that featured stars like David Boston and Shawn Springs. Those teams often saw their championship hopes crushed by Michigan losses, with no playoff safety net to provide redemption."},{"_id":"WVLB3ZIHPNBIPC63NIOPT6HUEA","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"“David Boston is a part of that 1990s era of players where you look back on the rosters and go, ‘how the heck were you losing to Michigan?’” Means noted. “And John Cooper didn’t have a 14 college football playoff where they could backdoor in. In 2022. He didn’t have a 12 team college football playoff where you lost to Michigan, you can’t win the Big Ten, but you’ve already locked yourself into a college football playoff and now they can go on a run.”"},{"_id":"RCP7TKNDCVCJXCKR5Z266NAURM","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"The implications for future Ohio State legends are profound. Current and future stars like Jeremiah Smith, Sonny Styles, and Tavian St. Clair will have more opportunities to create memorable moments and achieve team success thanks to the expanded playoff format."},{"_id":"V2ZLVRQ2NNDLRLGHMEQMYIJI3M","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"Even transfer quarterback Will Howard, who didn’t make the bracket despite quarterbacking the 2024 championship team, played a crucial role in this new paradigm. As Means explained: “He is a conduit. He’s here to help the people who are on this list solidify their legacies... Will Howard was here to make sure those two guys made the list.”"},{"_id":"TDC3V5LANZBJHBT6VSEE6IJFWU","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"This expanded path to greatness doesn’t diminish achievements—it provides more opportunities for program-defining moments. The Michigan game still matters enormously, but it’s no longer the absolute end of championship dreams, allowing players to write more complete legacies."},{"_id":"XSSFJHYU35AHFGNVT6DQOUJHPM","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"For future “Greatest Buckeye” debates, this new playoff era will likely produce more legends with national championship credentials. Players who might have been remembered primarily for Michigan disappointments now have pathways to redemption and immortality that their predecessors never enjoyed."},{"_id":"OW4K2XTSMRGONB33NJBOFQFDLU","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"The question now isn’t just who becomes Ohio State’s next generation of stars, but how many of them will leverage these new playoff opportunities to cement their places among the greatest Buckeyes of all time."},{"_id":"DAAV23VA3RCBBH5TKOQNUTVOGE","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"Here’s the podcast for this week:"},{"subtype":"spotify","referent":{"referent_properties":{},"provider":"https://embed.spotify.com/oembed/?url=","service":"oembed","id":"https://open.spotify.com/show/7uOqdaVcQdn6fi2MsPtjyu","type":"spotify"},"_id":"QPFCUZT4BRACNLRLOZQYK6TOQA","raw_oembed":{"provider_url":"https://spotify.com","type":"spotify","title":"Unveiling the ultimate Ohio State football challenge","thumbnail_url":"https://image-cdn-fa.spotifycdn.com/image/ab67656300005f1f3360d718d32aa13a7038920d","version":"1.0","thumbnail_height":300,"iframe_url":"https://open.spotify.com/embed/show/7uOqdaVcQdn6fi2MsPtjyu?utm_source=oembed","width":456,"thumbnail_width":300,"html":"<iframe style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" title=\"Spotify Embed: Unveiling the ultimate Ohio State football challenge\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/show/7uOqdaVcQdn6fi2MsPtjyu?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>","_id":"https://open.spotify.com/show/7uOqdaVcQdn6fi2MsPtjyu","provider_name":"Spotify","height":152},"type":"oembed_response"},{"_id":"RAY26TL4SZD23HWDBL4SJOGLIA","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":""},{"_id":"PZVAR5PTH5G45ILMHXVRWFTESQ","type":"raw_html","content":"<adi-stories-by-section-tag adiWidgetId=\"widgie-06c86407-aca1-4f71-aa94-e2db62dbbe06\"></adi-stories-by-section-tag>"},{"_id":"BKIHM3WK3FE6DHBMECIC72DWYM","type":"raw_html","content":"<style>.subtext-iframe{max-width:540px;}iframe#subtext_embed{width:1px;min-width:100%;min-height:256px;}</style><div class=\"subtext-iframe\"><iframe id=\"subtext_embed\" class=\"subtext-embed-iframe\" src=\"https://joinsubtext.com/buckeyetalk?embed=true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div><script>fetch(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alpha-group/iframe-resizer/master/js/iframeResizer.min.js\").then(function(r){return r.text();}).then(function(t){return new Function(t)();}).then(function(){iFrameResize({heightCalculationMethod:\"lowestElement\"},\"#subtext_embed\");});<\/script>"},{"_id":"RGGSGPZGQFCQRG7MQSWCDPBKAU","additional_properties":{},"type":"text","content":"<i>Note: Artificial intelligence was used to help generate this story from the Buckeye Talk Podcast by cleveland.com.
