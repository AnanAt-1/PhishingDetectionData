<p align="justify">There was plenty of room for the pro-abortion and invalidly married Catholic former Mayor the City of New York, New York, Rudolph William Giuliani, and his third wife, Judith Nathan Giuliani, at Saint Patrick's Cathedral today</p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, both of these men who believe that women have a legal &quot;right&quot; to slice and dice their innocent preborn babies were welcomed with applause, a standing ovation in the case of Bloomberg, who--along with Giuliani--supports the agenda of perversity of those steeped in unrepentant sins against nature in violation of the Sixth and Ninth Commandments:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <p align="justify">Saturday&rsquo;s service was intended primarily for clergy, but several prominent special guests could be spotted in the crowd, including former Mayor <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/rudolph_w_giuliani/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Rudolph W. Giuliani</a> and his wife, Judith. Mayor Bloomberg, who had come to the cathedral to welcome the pope, was thanked by a cathedral vicar and received a standing ovation from the clergy. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/nyregion/19cnd-pope.html?hp"><strong>At St. Patrick&rsquo;s, Antipope Makes a Call for Unity</strong></a></p>

  </blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top:0;">A standing ovation from &quot;priests&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; for an egregious, nasty little pro-abort, Michael Bloomberg? Michael Bloomberg was once sued by a female employee of his Bloomberg financial and media conglomerate for harassment when he responded as follows upon learning she was expecting a child, &quot;Kill it! Kill it!&quot; This episode was even too much for the pro-abort protege of Ralph Nader, Mark Green, who brought it up in a campaign advertisement when running as the Democrat Party nominee for Mayor of the City of New York, New York, in 2001 against Bloomberg, who had the endorsement of Republican Party even though he had been a lifelong Democrat until earlier that year. One of the first things that Michael Bloomberg attempted to do as Mayor of the City of New York in 2002 was to impose mandatory training in methods of surgical baby-killing in all of the obstetrics/genealogical residency programs  in all of the city's public hospitals, permitting no one to opt out of the program as a matter of conscience. A standing ovation for Michael Bloomberg, of all people? Michael Bloomberg? How is this not indicative of a fundamental loss of the <em>sensus Catholicus</em>? (There will be a bit more about &quot;applause&quot; in a short while.)</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Michael Bloomberg was especially applauded when he noted that it was Passover. &quot;Priests&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; broke out in applause to recognize a false, superseded religious observance that belongs to the devil. Please tell me that there has not been a fundamental loss of the Catholic Faith in the counterfeit church of conciliarism. </p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top:0;">Oh, yes, sure, Joseph Ratzinger/Benedict XVI, spoke about the &quot;Gospel of Life,&quot; praising the late Terence &quot;Cardinal&quot; Cooke and the John &quot;Cardinal&quot; O'Connor for their commitment to the &quot;gift of life.&quot; The word &quot;abortion,&quot; however, was not used once. The reality of the killing of a innocent preborn child was anesthetized by a nice, &quot;positive&quot; sounding euphemism. And what did the brief mention of the &quot;Gospel of Life&quot; mean? Nothing. Nothing to Edward &quot;Cardinal&quot; Egan, the current conciliar &quot;archbishop of New York, who said publicly seven years ago that we know when &quot;life&quot; begins. Nothing to Rudolph William Giuliani, who remains a close friend of Egan's. Nothing to Michael R. Bloomberg, that's for sure, another &quot;good friend&quot; of Egan's. Indeed, the now disgraced former Governor of the State of New York, Elliott Spitzer, a thoroughly reprehensible pro-abort, was considered by Egan to be his &quot;friend.&quot; There's no sanction offered by most of the conciliar &quot;bishops&quot; of the United States of America to those in public life who support the mystical dismemberment of Our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in the persons of innocent preborn babies.</p>
<p align="justify">There was also plenty of room at Nationals Park in Washington, District of Columbia, for the pro-aborts John F. Kerry and Nancy Pelosi and Christopher Dodd, each of whom received what purports to be Holy Communion in the Protestant and Masonic <em>Novus Ordo</em> service. The conciliar &quot;pontiffs&quot; are engaging in a gigantic farce when they speak about the &quot;Gospel of Life&quot; while they attack the life of souls by supporting condemned notions of the evolution of dogma, expressed in different ways at different times, of course, and the new ecclesiology, and religious liberty and the separation of Church and false ecumenism, all while engaging in the forbidden practice of &quot;inter-religious prayer&quot; while according the symbols of false religions great esteem and respect. This farce is compounded by the fact that the conciliar &quot;pontiffs&quot; have let their conciliar &quot;bishops&quot; determine for themselves how to deal with Catholics in public life who support various evils under cover of law, including the chemical and surgical assassination of preborn children.</p>
<p align="justify">And there was plenty of room at Saint Patrick's Cathedral for the thrice married pro-abort and pro-perversity advocate Rudolph William Giuliani to be given what purports to be Holy Communion at the <em>Novus Ordo</em> service staged by Joseph Ratzinger/Benedict XVI and co-staged by a number of &quot;bishops&quot; and &quot;priests&quot; just a few hours ago at Saint Patrick's Cathedral. And why not? Why should Giuliani be denied what was given to Kerry, Pelosi and Dodd and to Edward Moore Kennedy, of all people? </p>
<p align="justify">All talk of the &quot;Gospel of Life,&quot; which very phrase is an example of the naturalism of conciliarism's &quot;personalist&quot; &quot;conciliarspeak,&quot; you see, means nothing when the very Author of Life, supernatural and natural, God Himself, is offended in the context of the staging of the Protestant and Masonic <em>Novus Ordo</em> service. Although <a href="LatinandtheLectorBabe.html"><strong>Latin and the Lector Babe</strong></a> explored some of the &quot;traditions&quot; that the conciliar revolutionaries have handed down to Catholics yet attached to their counterfeit structures in the past forty years, it is useful to point out once again that there was plenty of room for every conciliar &quot;tradition&quot; imaginable but no room at all for the Mother of God to be mentioned by  Joseph Ratzinger/Benedict XVI in the &quot;homily&quot; he delivered in the presence of conciliar &quot;priests&quot; and religious&quot; as he called them to &quot;holiness.&quot; (See: 
  <a href="http://www.uspapalvisit.org/speeches/text08_stpats.htm"><span style="color:#750000;"><strong>Saint Patrick's Cathedral &quot;Homily,&quot; Saturday, April 18, 2008</strong>).</span></a> </p>
<p align="justify">Holiness? Holiness? How can anyone be holy without the help of the Mary our Immaculate Queen, she who is the Mediatrix of All Graces.</p>
<p align="justify">Holiness? Holiness? How can anyone be holy and not pray Our Lady's Most Holy Rosary, which contain an inexhaustible treasure of meditations on the mysteries of our salvation?</p>
<p align="justify">Holiness? Holiness? How can anyone who believes himself to be the Vicar of Christ on earth not seek to exhort those who believe themselves to be doing the work of the Catholic Church to invoke the maternal intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary and to imitate her example of holiness, thus aspiring to have the highest place next to her in Heaven? </p>
<p align="justify">Holiness? Holiness? How can a putative &quot;pope&quot; attempt to express &quot;sorrow&quot; for the sins of various conciliar &quot;bishops&quot; and &quot;priests&quot; while not publicly reminding Catholics and non-Catholics alike that the sins of all men wounded not only Our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in His Sacred Humanity but caused Seven Swords of Sorrow to be plunged through and through the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of His Most Blessed Mother? </p>
<p align="justify">Sure, Joseph Ratzinger/Benedict XVI has exhorted people now and again to pray the Rosary for various causes, including world peace. Fine. Our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ wants <em>all </em>men to know that the path to Him runs through deep devotion to His Most Blessed Mother. Our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ wants his shepherds to invite the sheep of His Sheepfold that is His Catholic Church to be consecrated to Him through His Most Blessed Mother's Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart.</p>
<p align="justify">How is it not possible in these times to speak of Our Lady's Fatima Message, to exhort Catholics alive today to make reparation for their sins and those of the whole world by praying as many Rosaries as their states-in-life permit? </p>
<p align="justify">Was there any talk of Total Consecration to Jesus through Mary today at Saint Patrick's Cathedral as the path of surrendering oneself totally to the Divine Redeemer through the Immaculate Heart of Mary? No. None at all.</p>
<p align="justify">All times, not only times such as these, call for simple exhortations to be given by shepherds to model their lives after the humility and docility and self-forgetfulness of Our Lady herself. No such exhortation was given at Saint Patrick's Cathedral by a man who once deconstructed devotion to Our Lady's Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart as follows (as quoted in <em>The Devil's Final Battle</em>):</p>
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <p align="justify">&quot;According to Matthew 5:8,&nbsp; the 'immaculate heart' is heart which, with God's grace, has come to perfect interior unity and therefore 'sees God.' To be 'devoted' to the Immaculate Heart of Mary means therefore to embrace this attitude of heart, which makes the fiat--'your will be done'--the defining centre of one's whole life.&quot; (Joseph Ratzinger, quoted in <em>The Devil's Final Battle</em>, p. 211.)</p>
  <p align="justify">It is Cardinal Ratzinger who removes the initial capitals from &quot;Immaculate Heart&quot; in order to reduce it to an 'immaculate heart' that anyone can have by simply conforming himself to God's will. With this exercise in clearly deliberate reductionism, the Cardinal completed his systematic removal of every bit of the Message of Fatima's explicitly Catholic prophetic content. (Text of <em>The Devil's Final Battle</em>, p. 211.)</p>
  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0;">There may yet be exhortations made by Joseph Ratzinger/Benedict XVI to beseech Catholics to rely upon the maternal intercession of Our Lady, perhaps coming as soon as this afternoon in the &quot;youth rally&quot; that will take place at Saint Joseph's Seminary in the Dunwoodie section of the City of Yonkers, New York. The <em>Ave Maria </em>will be sung in his presence by a singer by the name of Kelly Clarkson, noted for performing in, I am told, the most indecent of attire. It is possible that Joseph Ratzinger/Benedict XVI might invoke the example of Jacinta and Francisco Marto and Lucia dos Santos to the young Catholics at the &quot;youth rally.&quot; </p>
<p align="justify">Devotion to the Mother of God, however, is not an option in the interior life of a Catholic, something that can be mentioned now and again to specific groups at specific times. Devotion to the <em>Mother of God</em> is a necessity of the interior life of a Catholic. Men who believes to be priests and men and women who believe themselves to be consecrated religious need to be totally consecrated to Our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ through the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary. Then again, how is a possible for a man who has deconstructed the meaning of Our Lady's Immaculate Heart to exhort in such a manner.</p>
<p align="justify">There was no room for Mary our Immaculate Queen at Saint Patrick's Cathedral this morning.</p>
<p align="justify">There was plenty of room for applause, something that is strictly forbidden in a Catholic church.</p>
<p align="justify">There was plenty of room for narratives, as Edward &quot;Cardinal&quot; Egan boasted of the Tower of Babel fact that the Protestant and <em>Novus Ordo </em>service is staged in thirty-five different languages in the Archdiocese of New York.</p>
<p align="justify">There was plenty of room for women in the sanctuary (yes, more &quot;lector babes&quot;) and for a parade of women &quot;religious,&quot; some of whom were dressed, of course, in lay clothing, to recite the &quot;General Intercession of the Faithful&quot; in English, Akan (a dialect of the African country of Ghana), Korean, Portuguese, German, and a Chinese dialect (offered by a Maryknoll &quot;sister&quot; dressed in lay clothing).</p>
<p align="justify">There was plenty of room for the spectacle of the &quot;presentation of the gifts,&quot; which were received by Joseph Ratzinger/Benedict XVI with the same expressions of joy that he had received the symbols of the false religions of Talmudic Judaism, Mohammedanism, Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism not even two days ago now, believe it or not.</p>
<p align="justify">There was plenty of room for the distribution of what purports to be Holy Communion in the hand by Joseph Ratzinger/Benedict XVI himself.  Most of those men and women &quot;religious&quot; who &quot;received&quot; &quot;Communion&quot; from Ratzinger/Benedict stuck out their paws to do so. He complied most willingly.</p>
<p align="justify">There was plenty of room for Rudolph William Giuliani to be treated as a Catholic in good standing. </p>
<p align="justify">There was plenty of room for the embodiment of the <em>General Instruction to the Roman Missal</em>'s most apt description of its efforts to &quot;update&quot; the &quot;liturgy:&quot;</p>
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  <p align="justify">"Accordingly, a part of the new Roman Missal directs the prayer of the Church expressly to the <em>needs of our times</em>. This is above all true of the ritual Masses and the Masses for various needs and occasions, <strong>which happily combine the traditional and the contemporary.</strong> Thus many expressions, drawn from the Church's most ancient tradition and familiar through the many editions of the Roman Missal, have remained unchanged. Other expressions, however, have been adapted to today's needs and circumstances and still others-for example, the prayers for the Church, the laity, the sanctification of human work, the community of all peoples, certain needs proper to our era-are completely new compositions, drawing on the thoughts and even the very language of the recent conciliar documents.  
  <p align="justify">"The same awareness of the present state of the world also influenced the use of texts from very ancient tradition. It seemed that this cherished treasure would not be harmed if some phrases were changed so that the style of language would be more in accord with the language of modern theology and would faithfully reflect the actual state of the Church's discipline.<strong> Thus there have been changes of some expressions bearing on the evaluation and use of the good things of the earth and of <em>allusions to a particular form of outward penance belonging to another age in the history of the Church</em>.</strong>&quot; (Paragraph 15, <em>General Instruction to the Roman Missal</em>.)
  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0;">  </blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top:0;">Modernism is the synthesis of all heresies. Conciliarism's liturgical institutionalization and expression of its Modernist &quot;faith&quot; is quite manifest in what happened a few hours ago at Saint Patrick's Cathedral in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, adding to the many other egregious offenses given to Go by the false &quot;pope&quot; during his ongoing visit to the United States of America. And this does not even take into consideration the evils that might be committed before or during the forthcoming &quot;youth rally&quot; as souls might be exposed to the horror that is any form of &quot;rock&quot; music, including so-called &quot;Christian rock.&quot; (Oops. The false &quot;pope&quot; doesn't arrive for another ninety minutes. The &quot;rally&quot; is ongoing. The &quot;traditional&quot; Gospel singers are singing now.  Another commentary will be written later this evening for posting tomorrow.)</p>
<p align="justify">What is happening this week is a collection of travesties that are being associated, albeit wrongly, with the Catholic Church. </p>
<p align="justify">What can we do? </p>
<p align="justify">Reparation. Reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus through the Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary. This is what we are called to do at this time. It is all we can do. It is, however, most acceptable in the sight of the Most Holy Trinity, most pleasing to His Most Blessed Mother. </p>
<p align="justify">We are going out to Our Lady of the Rosary Chapel in Monroe, Connecticut, now to pray a Rosary of reparation. It is our hope that you will pray your own Rosaries of reparation for the offenses being given at this time to God and the incalculable harm that is being done to the souls for whom He shed every single drop of His Most Precious Blood.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Our Lady of Consolation, pray for us!</p>
<blockquote style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top:0;">Isn't it time to pray a Rosary now?</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Vivat Christus Rex</em>! <em>Viva Cristo Rey</em>!</p>
<p align="justify">Saint Joseph, pray for us.</p>
        <p align="justify">Saints Peter and Paul, pray for us.</p>
