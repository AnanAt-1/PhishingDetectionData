In January 1992 TV5 underwent a major overhaul including re-branding as "<b>TV5MONDE</b>" to stress its focus as a global network ("<b>Monde</b>" is French for "<b>World</b>"). Also part of the changes are a new schedule and new program line-up. Since 1993, "<b>TV5 Monde</b>" is part of the channel's corporate name. Its Canadian operations are branded "TV5 Québec Canada", however, though the shorter version TV5 is also used.<br />
