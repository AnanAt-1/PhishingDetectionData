IS   RESPECTFULLY  INSCRIBED 

BY  THE   AUTHOR 

AS   A    RECOGNITION  OF   HIS  EFFORTS  IN   PLACING

PREFACE. 

In  presenting  his  work  for  the  consideration  of  the  reader 
the  author  trusts  that  it  will  be  considered  rather  as  a  compil- 
ation than  as  a  history  and  judged  accordingly  with  greater 
leniency.  From  imperfect  records,  during  brief  intervals  of 
leisure,  the  material  has  been  gathered,  and  so  far  as  possible 
its  accuracy  has  been  ensured.  There  must,  however,  be  many 
things  in  '  the  life  which  all  men  live  yet  few  men  notice '  that 
have  escaped  both  recollection  and  chronicle,  and  it  is  in  the 
hope  that  the  artilleryman  of  the  next  century  who  takes  up 
the  thread  of  the  story  may  find  it  less  difficult  to  trace,  that 
the  writer  lays  down  his  pen  warmly  thanking  the  many  friends 
who  have  assisted  him  in  the  task  which  he  accepted  with  all 
its  difficulties  underestimated.

1793- 
The  Loyalists — War  with  France — Formation  of  the  First  Company — 
The  Muster  Roll — Preparations  for  Defence — Notes  on  the  First 
Members. 


HE  history  of  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery, 
if  it  were  written  after  years  of  research,  would  be  almost 
a  history  of  the  province  whose  name  it  bears.  A  single 
-company  formed  a  hundred  years  ago,  in  a  city  that  was  then 
but  a  village,  has  become  the  regiment  of  today,  and  the  city 
is  now  the  commercial  metropolis  of  New  Brunswick.  That 
company  was  founded  at  a  time  when  the  province  had  just 
been  brought  into  existence  by  the  efforts  of  a  few  men  whose 
example  of  loyalty  and  devotion  has  been  a  watchword  and 
rallying  cry  throughout  the  -succeeding  years. 

On  the  eighteenth  day  of  May,  1783,  there  had  landed  on  the 
inhospitable  shore  at  the  mouth  of  the  river  Saint  John  about 
three  thousand  men,  women  and  children,  who  had  left  the  scenes 
of  their  childhood  and  the  homes  of  their  age  rather  than  submit 
to  a  form  of  government  in  the  principles  of  which  they  could  not 


2  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

concur.  A  few  months  later,  in  September  of  that  year  another 
band  arrived  numbering  nearly  two  thousand  souls,  and  thus 
passed  into  history  a  name  that  shall  live  through  the  ages  —the 
Loyalists  of  1783.  So  was  founded  the  city  of  St.  John,  as  the 
district  of  Parrtown  was  afterwards  known,  when  it  received  a  royal 
charter  on  the  eighteenth  day  of  May,  1785.  In  such  a  commun- 
ity the  ranks  of  the  pioneer  artillery  company  were  ten  years  later 
filled  by  men  who  had  been  in  close  touch  with  those  mighty 
events  which  caused  the  poHtical  division  of  this  continent,  and 
by  others,  who,  coming  from  the  mother  country  had  cast  in  their 
lot  with  those  who  upheld  in  the  new  province  the  principles 
and  institutions  to  which  they  were  devotedly  attached.  The 
muster  rolls  of  our  artillery  for  the  past  century  contain  the  names 
of  men  whose  patriotism,  ability  and  influence  have  been  at  the 
service  of  their  country  in  whatever  capacity  she  has  required 
them.  It  is,  therefore,  of  great  moment  to  the  present  members 
of  the  corps  that  its  record  should  be  perpetuated  during  the 
coming  years,  in  the  hope  that  the  illustrious  example  of  the 
past  may  be  followed  in  the  present  and  the  future. 

A  history,  like  all  things  finite,  must  have  a  beginning,  but 
in  a  work  like  this,  it  is  somewhat  difficult  to  fix  the  proper 
period  for  commencement.  That  the  origin  of  the  regiment  can 
be  traced  to  the  Reign  of  Terror  is  a  statement  which  seems 
at  first  sight  to  be  more  fanciful  than  exact,  yet  that  series  of 
events  which  shed  such  a  lurid  light  upon  the  last  decade  of 
the  eighteenth  century,  is  really  the  cause  of  which  our  organ- 
ization today  is  the  indirect  result.  While  on  the. 21st  January, 
1793,  the  infuriated  populace  of  Paris  was  exulting  over  the 
death  of  Louis  XVI,  Colonel  Bonaparte,  the  young  Corsican 
officer,  commanded  the  artillery  of  the  republic  at  Toulon.  Years 
afterwards  a  future  commander  of  our  regiment  of  artillery  was 


N.     P..    (.ARKISON     AK^I1,I.KK^.  3 

an  officer  on  the  island  station  where  the  great  emperor  was 
imprisoned.  The  crash  of  the  guillotine  and  the  thunder  of 
the  guns  at  Toulon,  roused  the  nations  of  Europe.  War  was 
declared  by  France  against  Great  Britain,  Holland,  Spain,  Austria 
atid  Prussia,  and  counter  declarations  were  made.  In  con- 
sequence of  this  the  then  Colonial  Secretary,  Mr.  Henry 
DuNDAS,  sent  a  letter  dated  at  Whitehall,  9th  February,  1793, 
to  the  lieutenant-governor  of  Nova  Scotia  informing  him  that  the 
persons  exercising  the  supreme  authority  in  France  had  declared 
war  against  the  king  of  England  on  the  first  of  that  month — 
that  letters  of  marque  or  commissions  of  privateer  would  be 
granted  in  the  usual  manner  and  giving  assurance  to  all  owners 
of  armed  ships  and  vessels  that  his  majesty  would  consider 
them  as  having  a  just  claim  to  the  king's  share  of  all  French 
ships  and  property  of  which  they  might  make  prize.  A  similar 
despatch  was  probably  sent  to  the  lieutenant-governor  of  New 
Brunswick.  x\t  the  same  time  a  circular  letter  was  sent  to  the 
lieutenant-governors  of  both  provinces  requiring  them  to  raise 
provincial  corps  of  six  hundred  men  each,  the  subsistence  and 
equipment  of  which  was  to  be  a  charge  upon  the  royal  ex- 
chequer. On  the  4th  May,  1793,  Governor  (Brigadier-General) 
Thomas  Carleton  wrote  to  Major-General  Clarke,  then  in 
command,  stating  that  he  had  appointed  Edward  Winslow, 
Esq.,  Muster-master  General  of  the  late  provincial  forces,  to 
muster  and  inspect  the  recruits  for  one  of  these  corps,  the 
King's  N.  B.  Regiment.  This  regiment  was  entirely  distinct 
from  the  militia  which  at  the  same  time  was  being  organized 
as  rapidly  as  possible. 

The  peace  which  followed  the  American  rebellion,  had  left 
the  provinces  in  a  supine  state  with  respect  to  military  organi- 
zation and  defences.     An   act   providing  for  the  enrolment  of 


HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 


the  militia  had  been  passed  in  1787  but  does  not  appear  to 
have  been  acted  upon.  Another  law,  repealing  the  former,  was 
enacted  in  1792,  and  under  this  the  enrolment  of  the  militia 
began,  while  the  regiment  for  service  with  troops  of  the  line 
was  also  being  rhustered.  In  those  times  the  militia  represented 
not  alone  the  lads  and  young  men  of  the  community  but  in 
reality  every  able  bodied  man  from  sixteen  to  sixty  years  of  age 
with  the  exception  of  a  very  few  exempts.  The  feeling  of  dan- 
ger was  immediate  and  personal  and  there  was  a  commensurate 
sense  of  responsibility.  Many  of  the  citizens  were  men  who 
had  fought  for  their  homes  and  lost  everything  in  their  struggle 
for  king  and  conscience.  Such  men  were  the  leaders  of  pub- 
lic opinion  in  our  province,  and  under  the  stimulus  of  their 
example  it  is  quite  probable  that  the  ranks  were  quickly  and 
willingly  filled.  Under  such  circumstances  and  from  such  splen- 
did material,  on  the  fourth  day  of  May,  1793,  there  was  en- 
rolled in  the  Loyal  Company  of  Artillery  of  the  city  of  Saint 
John  the  following  patriotic  men  : — 

John  Colville,  captain. 

Thomas  Gilbert,   ist  lieutenant. 

John  Ward,  2nd  lieutenant. 

Oliver  Bourdette,  John  Chubb,  sergeants.

The  muster  roll  was  completed  not  a  day  too  soon.  On  the 
6th  May  news  was  received  at  Saint  John  that  a  French  priv- 
ateer of  ten  guns  and  forty-five  men  was  cruising  in  the  Bay 
of  Fundy.  A  night  patrol  was  immediately  established  and 
Capt.  Robert  Reed  of  the  'Independent  Volunteers'  took  the 
first  tour  of  duty.  Some  proposed  to  fit  out  an  armed  vessel  to 
go  after  the  belligerent  stranger.  Another  guard-house  was  pro- 
vided for  the  watch,  and  a  double  guard  was  placed  at  the 
Lower  Cove  battery — probably  Dorchester  battery.  This  fort 
was  then  armed  with  i8-pr.  guns  which  it  is  gravely  stated, 
were  '  so  excellently  situated  as  to  prevent  the  possibiUty  of  an 
'enemy's  ship  coming  into  the  harbor.'  The  expected  vessel 
never  came  and  the  night  patrol  exerted  its  vigilance  tor  noth- 
ing. Later  on,  in  August,  there  was  another  scare  caused  by 
the  report  that  a  large  naval  force  of  the  enemy  had  arrived 


6  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

on  this  continent.  Governor  Carleton  hastened  to  St.  John, 
which  was  in  a  state  of  alarm,  and  directed  the  erection  of 
some  fortifications  which  were  thought  to  render  the  city  per- 
fectly safe  against  attache  by  sea.  Again,  in  October,  a  report 
was  spread  that  two  thousand  four  hundred  French  troops 
among  which  were  'a  banditti  of  miscreants '  and  some  desert- 
ers from  Galbaud's  corps,  were  ready  to  embark  at  New  York. 
They  were  said  to  have  forty  horses  and  sixteen  pieces  of  field 
artillery  but  were  badly  clothed.  Governor  Carleton  did  not 
suppose  that  New  Brunswick  would  be  the  objective  point  of 
this  expedition  but  as  a  matter  of  precaution  he  ordered  forty 
artillerymen  (Royal)  and  a  detachment  of  about  eighty  men  of 
the  King's  New  Brunswick  Regiment,  commanded  by  Major 
Murray,  to  St.  John.  Capt.  Clinch's  company  of  that  regi- 
ment was  stationed  at  Passamaquoddy  and  the  remaining  com- 
panies at  Fredericton  and  the  upper  posts.  The  governor 
reviewed  the  militia  of  the  city  of  St.  John  and  five  hundred 
and  eleven  non-commissioned  officers  and  men  responded.  He 
set  them  to  work  preparing  fascines  and  throwing  up  tempor- 
ary works  for  the  protection  of  the  harbor.  This  was  the  first 
military  employment  of  the  militia  artillery.  At  this  time  the 
common  council  of  the  city  had  under  consideration  the  ob- 
taining of  some  lots  in  St.  James  street  for  the  purposes  of 
fortification  but  the  project  appears  to  have  been  abandoned. 
Despite  the  danger,  either  malice  or  mischief  was  not  suppressed 
as  the  following  extract  from  the  minutes  of  common  council 
of  8th  November,   1793,  will  shew: — 

"  Information  having  been  given  to  this  board  that  the  Centi- 
"nals  posted  at  the  batteries  have  in  several  instances  been  as- 
"saulted  by  some  evil  disposed  persons  who  have  thrown  stones 
"  at  them  in  the  dark  ; 


N.    1^    GARRISON    ARTILLKRY.  7 

"Ordered,  that  the  Clark  do  prepare  an  advertisement  to 
**send  to  the  publick  papers  offering  in  the  name  of  the  cor- 
"poration  20  dollars  reward  to  any  person  who  shall  discover 
"the  offender  or  offenders  to  be  paid  on  conviction." 

No  further  reports  appear  to  have  been  received  during  the 
winter  and  there  was  no  further  reference  to  the  unfortunate 
sentinels.  The  alarm  of  the  French  revolution,  however,  had, 
among  other  things,  caused  the  formation  of  a  company  of 
artillery  which  has  unbroken  historical  continuity  with  the  or- 
ganization of  today.  It  will  be  noticed  that  the  term  'company' 
is  used  in  referring  to  the  artillery  of  that  time.  It  was  then 
and  until  about  1862  continued  to  be  the  correct  designation 
of  artillery.  It  is  a  fact,  worthy  of  note,  that  Captain  Col- 
ville's  company  was  organized  only  seventy-seven  years  later  than 
the  formation  of  that  splendid  regiment  which  shares  in  every 
victory  of  British  arms  and  proudly  writes  ^Ubique'  on  its  shield. 
The  Royal  artillery  having  been  organized  with  two  companies 
claim  regimental  history  from  17 16,  while  their  New  Brunswick 
kinsman  must  be  content  with  the  record  of  a  single  company 
until  1833.  At  first  our  company  formed  a  part  of  the  Saint 
John  County  militia  and  was  accorded  the  honor  due  to  artil- 
lery of  occupying  the  right  flank  at  inspections  and  reviews. 
When  the  annual  parade  states  were  made  up  the  staff  officers 
and  non-commissioned  .  officers  were  always  included  in  the 
state  of  the  artillery.  Another  and  a  very  special  distinction 
was  accorded  to  this  company — that  of  wearing  gold  facings 
instead  of  those  at  that  time  usually  worn  by  colonial  corps. 

The  personnel  of  the  first  muster-roll  is  an  interesting  study 
to  a  resident  of  St.  John.  Many  of  the  names  are  still  borne 
by  the  descendants  of  the  old  artillerymen  while  others  have 
completely  died  out.     John  Colville,  the  first  captain,  was  a 


8  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

man  of  wealth  and  position  in  the  Httle  community.  By  the 
city  charter  he  had  been  appointed  assistant  to  the  alderman 
for  Kings  ward,  a  position  which  gave  him  a  seat  at  the  com- 
mon council,  in  the  minutes  of  which  he  is  frequently  referred 
to  by  his  miHtary  title.  In  1794,  after  several  years  of  absence 
from  the  board,  he  was  elected  alderman  for  the  same  ward, 
and  in  1795  having  been  again  chosen  to  that  position  he  ap- 
peared at  the  council  and  declined  re-election.  He  had  also 
held  several  minor  offices  under  the  city.  Captain  Colville 
was  the  founder  of  the  commercial  firm  of  Crookshaxk  &amp; 
Johnston,  which  flourished  for  many  years.  The  senior  mem- 
ber of  that  firm  was  Andrew  Crookshank,  whose  mother  had 
married  Captain  Colville.  Andrew  Crookshank  afterwards 
succeeded  to  the  command  of  the  artillery  company. 

Captain  Colville  is  buried  in  the  Church  of  England  bury- 
ing ground  at  St.  John.  The  following  is  the  inscription  on 
his  tombstone  : — 

John  Colville. 

Died  Nov.   7,   1808, 

In  the  71st*  year  of  his  age, 

Mr.  Colville  came  to  this  province  with  the 
Loyalists  in  1783,  and  was  for  many  years 
a  merchant  in  this  city,  during  which  time 
his  unflinching  integrity  won  for  him  the 
sincere  esteem  of  every  honest  man,  to 
whom  he  was  known.

The  *  Crookshank  house '  as  it  is  now  known  was  the  resi- 
dence of  John  Colville.  It  was  situated  on  Prince  William 
street  opposite  the  Bank  of  British  North  America,  and  at  its 
destruction  in  1895  was  the  oldest  house  in  St.  John.  The 
material  for  its  construction  was  brought  to  the  city  by  packet. 
Its  owner  drew  Nos.  50  and  159  in  the  original  distribution 
of  lots  on  the  eastern  side '  of  the  harbor  among  the  loyalist 
settlers  of  the  city. 

Thomas  Gilbert,  the  first  lieutenant,  was  one  of  the  Gil- 
bert family  of  which  there  are  a  number  of  descendants  in  the 
province  today. 

John'  Ward,  second  lieutenant,  was  one  of  the  very  few  of 
the  original  members  of  the  company  who  was  destined  to 
witness  the  celebration  of  its  fiftieth  anniversary.  His  name  is 
still  fresh  and  his  record  bright  while  nearly  all  of  his  com- 
panions have  faded  out  of  recollection.  A  later  chapter  will 
deal  with  the  history  of  this  excellent  officer  in  some  detail. 

Oliver  Bourdette,  sergeant,  was,  like  his  brother  Stephen, 
who  was  a  private  in  the  company,  'a  respectable  citizen  of 
St.  John.' 

John  Chubb,  sergeant,  was  a  loyalist  who  came  to  this  prov- 
ince in  1783.  He  carried  on  the  business  of  a  shoemaker  and 
tanner  in  company  with  Jehiel  Partelow.  His  son  was  Henry 
Chubb,  the  editor  and  proprietor  of  the  '  Courier,'  one  of  the 
early  newspapers  of  the  city,  from  the  files  of  which  much  in- 
teresting material  has  been  gathered  for  this  work.  John  Chubb 
died  October  15th,   1822,  aged  69  years. 

Alexander  McPherson,  one  -of  the  privates,  died  on  the 
5th  January,  1819,  at  the  age  of  64  years.  He  was  then  an 
old  and  respected  inhabitant  of  the  city.  There  was  a  lieutenant 
in  the  New  Jersey  volunteers   of  the  same  name.

fHE  events  in  Europe  ceased  to  affect  the  colonies  in 
America,  so  far  as  the  danger  of  invasion  was  concerned 
after  the  year  1793,  though  commerce  was  considerably 
interfered  with.  An  era  of  comparative  quiet  began  which  was 
not  materially  disturbed  for  many  years.  The  next  event  of 
importance  to  the  young  artillery  company,  and  indeed  to  the 
city  of  Saint  John,  was  the  visit  of  a  royal  prince,  the  first  of 
many  occasions  on  which  members  of  the  royal  family  have 
been  received  in  this  province.  Prince  Edward,  Duke  of  Kent, 
a  son  of  George  III,  and  the  father  of  our  present  Most 
Gracious  Sovereign  was,  at  this  time,  in  military  command  at 
Quebec.  In  1794  he  visited  Halifax,  and  after  staying  there  for 
a  time,  proceeded  to  Annapolis  on  June  14th,  where  he  em- 
barked in  the  Zebra  sloop  of  war,  for  Saint  John  Here  he 
arrived  on  the  19th  June.  The  Royal  Gazette  of  24th  June 
of  that  year  in  a  letter  thus  describes  his  visit  : — 

On  Wednesday  last  (i8th  June)  arrived  in  this  city  from 
Fredericton,  His  Excellency  Major-General  Carleton,  Governor 
of  this  province,  to  meet  His  Royal  Highness  Prince  Edward, 
who  was  hourly  expected  from  Digby,  to  which  place  he  had 
passed  through  the  country  from  Halifax  on  a  visit  to  this 
province.  His  Excellency  was  received  by  a  salute  from  the 
Royal  Artillery  here  upon  his  landing,  and  yesterday,  (19th  June) 
at  4  o'clock  p.    m.,   arrived    His   Majesty's    ship  of  war  Zebniy

commanded  by  Capt.  Vaughan,  having  on  board  His  Royal 
Highness  attended  by  Capt.  Vezey,  one  of  his  aides-de-camp. 
,A  royal  salute  was  fired  from  Dorchester  battery  as  the  ship 
passed.  At  6  o'clock  His  Royal  Highness  left  the  ship,  which 
immediately  fired  a  royal  salute,  and  in  a  few  minutes  he  came 
ashore  at  the  public  landing  which  was  crowded  and  surround- 
ed by  a  great  concourse  of  loyal  subjects,  who  had  collected, 
eager  to  testify  their  joy  upon  this  very  pleasing  and  flattering 
occasion.  ^fr         ^k         ^  *  *-x--x--x--x- 

Prince  William  street  was  lined  on  both  sides  from  the 
landing  to  Mr.  Chipman's  house  (where  rdoms  were  prepared 
for  the  reception  of  His  Royal  Highness)  by  the  Cadet  com- 
pany in  their  uniform,  the  Artillery  company  of  the  city  and 
several  of  the  companies  of  the  militia  under  arms,  who  made 
a  very  good  appearance  and  with  which  His  Royal  Highness 
appeared  to  be  much  pleased. 

Immediately  upon  his  landing  royal  salutes  were  fired  by  the 
Artillery  Company  of  the  City  and  from  the  armed  brig  Union 
and  His  Royal  Highness  with  that  complacency  and  dignity 
which  so  strongly  mark  his  character  passed  between  the  lines, 
and  attended  as  he  was,  received  at  the  landing  to  Mr.  Chip- 
man's  house. 

At  seven  o'clock  in  the  evening  His  Royal  Highness  received 
an  address  from  the  Mayor,  Aldermen  and  Commonalty  of  the 
City.  He  left  St.  John  the  following  day  for  Fredericton  and 
returned  on  the  succeeding  Monday.  On  Tuesday,  after  hold- 
ing a  levee  and  inspecting  the  fortifications,  he  re-embarked  for 
Digby  671  route  to  Halifax. 

The  Chipman  house  is  still  standing  in  a  state  of  good  pre- 
servation. More  than  half  a  century  later  it  was  destined  to 
receive  H.  R.  H.  the  Prince  of  Wales  on  his  visit  to  the 
provinces.  From  the  height  on  which  it  is  situated  may  be 
seen  the  site  of  old  Fort  La  Tour,  memorable  for  its  gallant 
defence  by  the  heroic  French  lady  of  that  name  ;  Fort  Howe, 
in  the  garrison  of  which    Cobbett  was   a   private  soldier ;    and

the  gray  old  Martello  Tower  on  Carleton  Heights  which  stands 
a  lonely  sentinel  of  the  historic  past. 

Another  incident  connecting  Prince  Edward  with  Saint  John 
may  be  noticed  here.  In  1799  he  became  Commander-in-Chief 
of  H.  M.  forces  in  British  North  America,  and  on  this  occasion 
the  common  council  of  Saint  John,  at  a  meeting  held  27th 
November  of  that  year  'voted  the  following  address  to  His 
Royal  Highness  : — 

To  His  Royal  highness  Prince  Edward,  Duke  of  Kent  and 
Strathern,  Knight  of  the  most  Noble  Order  of  the  Garter 
and  of  the  ?nost  Illustrious  Order  of  Saint  Patrick,  Gen- 
eral and  Commander-in-Chief  of  all  His  Majesty's  forces  in 
British  North  America,  etc. 
May  it  please    Your  Excellency  : — 

The  Mayor,  Aldermen  and  Commonalty  of  the  City  of  Saint 
John  beg  leave  in  an  humble  address  to  approach  your  Royal 
Highness  with  sentiments  of  loyalty,  gratitude  and  respect  in  the 
expression  of  which  language  fails  to  give  utterance  to  the  ful- 
ness of  their  hearts. 

When  we  reflect  that  the  city  and  the  province  of  which  it 
is  a  part,  both  yet  in  their  infancy,  are  the  offspring  of  loyalty 
to  the  best  of  sovereigns  and  of  attachment  to  a  constitution 
the  birth  right  of  British  subjects  and  the  envy  and  admira- 
tion of  surrounding  nations,  we  feel  those  principles  of  our  origin 
indissolubly  strengthened  and  confirmed  by  His  Majesty's  most 
gracious  favor  in  appointing  to  the  chief  military  command  of 
his  dominion  in  this  part  of  the  world  so  illustrious  a  branch 
of  his  august  family  and  one  in  so  eminent  a  degree  inherit- 
ing his  father's  virtues. 

The  pleasure  with  which  our  bosoms  beat  high  when  your 
Royal  Highness  heretofore  condescended  to  visit  this  province 
still  vibrates  in  our  breasts  ;  we  then  experienced  a  high  and 
proud  satisfaction  from  your  residence  in  a  part  of  the  country 
so  near  to  us.  But  when  we  find  the  safety,  interest,  and  wel- 
fare of  this  part  of  the  empire  the  distinguished  and  favored 
object  of  your  voluntary  patronage  and  care — sensations  of  un- 
bounded gratitude  arise  in  quick  succession  to  our  most  gracious 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 9 

sovereign  for  conferring,  and  to  your  Royal  Highness  for 
accepting,  the  high  and  important  trust  committed  to  your 
hands.  From  these  signal  instances  of  royal  benevolence  and 
at'tention  the  most  public  benefits  are  naturally  anticipated, 
and  the  knowledge  we  have  of  the  character  drawn  from  the 
conduct  of  your  Royal  Highness  on  past  occasions  encourages 
our  indulgence  of  the  most  sanguine  hopes. 

While  virtue,  talents  and  exalted  rank  happily  united  shall 
be  respected  among  mankind— while  high  command  in  all  its 
just  arrangements  and  minute  operations  directed  solely  to  the 
public  safety  and  the  public  welfare — shall  claim  the  esteem 
and  applause  of  the  virtuous  and  the  good — the  name  of  your 
Royal  Highness  will  stand  eminently  conspicuous  on  the  rolls 
of  fame. 

That  your  Royal  Highness  thro'  a  long  life  yet  to  come 
may  enjoy  the  satisfaction  and  happiness  and  your  country  the 
benefits  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  qualities  so  enviable  and 
so  great  will  be  our  ardent  and  unceasing  prayer. 

(Signed)     Wm.  Campbell,   Mayor.

Common  Clerk. 

Scarcely  anything  could  be  imagined  more  adulatory  than  this 
address,  but  the  people  of  the  time  must  be  credited  with 
deep  feehng  of  the  sentiments  which  they  rather  effusively 
expressed.  At  the  time  of  passing  the  address  John  Ward, 
the  lieutenant,  and  Oliver  Bourdette,  one  of  the  sergeants, 
named  in  the  first  muster  roll,  occupied  seats  at  the  council, 
the  former  as  alderman  for  Kings  and  the  latter  as  assistant 
for  Queens  ward. 

In  the  year  1798  Britain  was  engaged  in  a  life  and  death 
struggle  w^ith  the  combined  powers  of  France  and  Spain.  Bona- 
parte contemplated  and  made  preparation  for  the  invasion  of 
England.  The  resources  of  parliament  were  at  a  low  ebb  and 
the  national  existence  was  at  stake.  An  appeal  was  made  to 
the  nation  at  large,  and  the  response  was  hearty  and  immediate.

Books  for  voluntary  subscriptions  were  opened  at  the  Bank 
of  England — all  subscriptions  to  be  annual  during  the  war, 
or  so  long  as  required.  The  king  headed  the  list  with 
^200,000  sterling,  and  contributions  flowed  in  from  all  quar- 
ters from  thousands  of  pounds  down  to  sixpences,  even  the  mite 
of  the  widow  and  the  infant  helping  to  swell  the  general  fund.  In 
a  short  time  ^£'5, 000, 000  sterling  was  raised  in  Great  Britain. 
The  colonies  loyally  united  with  the  mother  country,  the  in- 
fant province  of  New  Brunswick,  with  a  population  of  perhaps 
fifteen  thousand,  contributing  ^3,000  towards  the  national  de- 
fence. Lieutenant-Governor  Carleton  headed  the  list  with 
j£soo.  Chief  Justice  Ludlow  contributed  ;£^ioo  and  others 
in  proportion.  On  June  15th,  1798,  the  Adjutant-General 
of  New  Brunswick  by  command  of  His  Excellency  the 
Lieutenant-Governor  addressed  a  circular  to  the  colonels  of  the 
militia  regiments  requesting  them  to  bring  the  matter  of  con- 
tributing to  the  fund  for  national  defence  before  their  captains 
in  order  that  the  men  of  their  companies  might  have  the  op- 
portunity of  subscribing  such  sums  as  they  could  afford, 
the  same  to  be  transmitted  to  the  Duke  of  Portland, 
one  of  His  Majesty's  Principal  Secretaries  of  State.  The  fol- 
lowing sums  were  contributed  by  Captain  Colville's  company 
of  Militia  Artillery :

-  Exclusive  of  the  above  sum  £iio  was  paid  by  different 
members  of  the  company,  under  the  head  of  "City  and  County 
oC  Saint  John  "  which  makes  the  total  amount  that  the  company 
subscribed  ^^^208  5   10. 

The  news  of  Nelson's  victory  at  the  battle  of  the  Nile, 
fought  August  I  St,  1798,  reached  Saint  John  by  the  ship  William, 
Capt.  Hunter,  about  the  23d  November  following.  It  was 
received  with  universal  exultation.  The  Saint  John  Gazette 
records  : — 'as  soon  as  the  agreeable  intelligence  reached  this 
'loyal  city  the  forts  and  shipping  in  the  harbour  were  decorated 
'with  their  flags  flying,  and  universal  joy  diffused  itself  through 
'every  order  of  the  people.  At  12  o'clock  a  salute  of  21  guns 
'was  fired  by  the  Royal  Artillery,  followed  by  a  discharge  of 
'three  volleys  from  the  troops  in  garrison,  which  was  returned 
'by  the  same  number  of  guns  from  the  City  Artillery  and 
'ship    William,  Capt.  Hunter.' 

There  was  a  spontaneous  desire  for  illumination  which  was 
duly  carried  into  effect,  and  that  night  Saint  John  held  high 
carnival.  The  houses  of  Hon.  Geo.  Leonard,  John  Black, 
Esq.,  and  many  others  "flamed  away  from  top  to  bottom.'' 
The  shipping  in  the  harbour  was  brilliantly  illuminated,  cannon 
were  discharged  from  the  Artillery  p'~--k  and  the  battery  by  the 
garrison  and  City  Artillery,  the  stree^  resounded  with  cheers 
for  Nelson  and  the  Navy,  and  altogether  the  night  was  one 
of  the  most  memorable  in  the  early  days  of  Saint  John. 

The  next  muster  roll  of  the  corps  which  is  extant  is  that  of 
1809.  That  many  changes  had  taken  place  in  the  sixteen  years 
since  formation  will  readily  be  seen  by  a  glance  at  the  names 
which  appear  as  follows  : —

The  roll  was  made  up  on  2nd  August,  18 10,  and  if  there 
was  any  military  observance  of  the  old  King's  jubilee  at  Saint 
John,  the  Artillery  company  was  sure  to  have  taken  part  in  it. 

On  August  1 2th,  181 1,  the  Artillery  was  mustered  again. 
A  few  more  changes  had  taken  place  in  the  ranks  as  the  fol- 
lowing will  shew: —

Upon  the  death  of  Capt.  Colville,  in  1808,  Andrew 
Crookshank  had  become  captain  of  the  company,  and  at  some 
time  previous  to  181 2,  Willliam  Donald  had  succeeded  to 
the  first  lieutenancy  and  David  Waterbury  had  been  appoint- 
ed second  lieutenant.  Andrew  Crookshank  as  before  stated, 
was  the  stepson  of  John  Colville,  and  was  a  merchant  of  the 
city.  He  represented  King's  ward  in  18 13  and  18 14  as  alder- 
man. In  the  latter  year  David  Waterbury  was  assistant 
for  the  same  ward. 

A  return  of  arms  and  accoutrements  in  1808,  shows  that  the 
Artillery  company  then  had  two  6-pr.  guns,  complete,  but  they 
were  without  muskets  or  side  arms.  The  belts  were  only 
round  belts  or  a  strap  and  frog  which  '  had  to  answer  all  pur- 
poses.'

'^^HE  bitter  feelings  engendered  by  the  revolution  of  the 
\J  American  colonies  were  not  destined  to  quickly  die  out. 
Though  nominally  at  peace  with  England,  yet  many  of 
the  states  saw  in  the  great  struggle  between  that  nation  and 
Erance,  an  opportunity  for  striking  another  blow  at  the  mother 
land.  This  feeling  was  confined  to  the  Southern  and  Western 
states,  while  those  in  the  North-eastern  portion  of  the  Union 
sympathized  with  the  British  colonies  across  the  line.  The 
great  naval  contest  in  which  Britain  was  then  engaged  made  the 
obtaining  of  seamen  a  matter  of  vital  importance.  Desertions 
were  frequent  under  the  rough  discipHne  of  those  days  and, 
alluring  as  their  tales  of  glory  now  may  be,  it  was  necessary 
to  resort  to  impressment  and  other  severe  measures  to  keep  up 
the  supply  and  prevent  unauthorized  abandonment  of  the  ser- 
vice. The  American  merchant  service  was  growing  and  that 
nation  being  at  peace  with  all  the  world  employment  in  her 
marine  was  eagerly  sought.  Men  who  had  served  in  the  Brit- 
ish Navy  were  of  course  most  desirable  seamen  and  by  that  class 
the  American  vessels  were  principally  manned.  Great  Britain 
resolved  to  put  an  end  to  desertions  and  claimed  a  "right  of 
search "  of  all  vessels  on   the   high  seas  for  that    purpose.     So 


N.    B.    OARRISON    ARTILLERY.  25 

early  as  1807,  a  collision  occurred  on  this  subject  which  angered 
the  Americans.  H.  M.  S.  Leopard  stopped  the  U.  S.  ship 
Chesapeake,  when  sailing  out  of  Hampton  Roads.  There  was 
some  resistance  and  the  Leopard  fired  on  the  other  vessel  after 
which  four  men  were  taken  from  the  Chesapeake  as  deserters 
froiji  the  British  Navy.  From  that  time  the  nations  drifted 
rapidly  towards  war,  for  which  the  British  Government  made 
preparation.  In  New  Brunswick  as  before  stated  Thomas  Car- 
LETON  was  Lieutenant-Governor.  He  retained  this  position 
until  his  death  in  18 17,  but  in  1803  having  gone  to  England, 
on  leave,  the  administration  of  the  government  devolved  on 
Gabriel  G.  Ludlow,  who  had  been  the  first  mayor  of  Saint 
John.  In  1808  he  was  succeeded  by  Edward  Winslow  who 
occupied  the  office  of  administrator  from  February  until  May 
of  that  year.  On  May  24th  Major-General  Martin  Hun- 
ter assumed  the  administration,  the  home  government  having 
decided  to  appoint  military  officers  over  all  the  provinces.  He 
continued  in  office  until  9th  April,  181 2,  with  the  exception  of 
two  short  absences  in  1808  and  181 1,  during  which  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  George  Johnston  and  Major-General  William  Bal- 
four presided.  In  181 2  Major-General  Hunter  was  succeeded 
as  President  of  His  Majesty's  Council  by  Major-General  G.  Tracey 
Smythe. 

On  the  1 8th  June  of  that  year  an  act  of  Congress  was  passed 
declaring  war  against  Great  Britain.  The  necessity  for  a  mili- 
tary governor  and  the  advisability  of  such  an  appointment  was 
now  shown.  On  the  intelligence  being  received  in  New  Bruns- 
wick His  Honor,  the  President,  promptly  communicated  with 
the  City  of  St.  John  on  the  subject  of  fortifying  that  place 
against  the  probable  danger  of  invasion.  At  a  meeting  held 
on    ist  July,   181 2,    the    common    council  resolved,     'that   they 


26  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

'  would  lend  every  aid  and  assistance  within  their  power  to- 
'  wards  the  objects  suggested,  and  would  take  steps  forthwith  to 
'  agree  with  the  proprietors  of  the  lots  on  and  around  the  ruins 
'of  Fort  Frederick  to  satisfy  and  compensate  them  for  any 
'  damage  that  might  be  necessarily  sustained  by  them  in  con- 
'  sequence  of  erecting  the  contemplated  fortifications.' 

They  also  resolved,  'that  the  members  of  the  board  would 
'personally  attend  to  aid  and  assist  in  the  work,  and  do  all 
'  within  the  compass  of  their  power  to  induce  the  inhabitants 
'of  the  city  to  volunteer  their  exertions  and  services  in  so 
'necessary  an  undertaking.' 

Aldermen  Sancton  and  Seely  and  Assistant  Gardner  were 
appointed  a  committee  to  see  the  proprietors  of  the  lots  on 
and  surrounding  the  ruins  of  Fort  Frederick  and  to  enter  into 
any  arrangement  with  them  that  might  be  requisite,  on  the  sub- 
ject of  the  intended  fortifications. 

At  the  next  meeting  of  the  city  council,  held  July  7th,  18 12, 
a  remarkable  communication  was  laid  before  them  by  the  mayor. 
It  was  a  letter  which  had  been  received  by  him  from  '  the  chair- 
'  man  of  a  committee  of  public  safety  for  the  town  of  East  Port, 
'in  the  District  of  Maine,  expressive  of  a  determination  of  the 
'  inhabitants  of  that  district  to  abstain  from  all  depredations  on 
'the  property  or  hostility  against  the  persons  of  the  inhabitants 
'of  this  province  during  the  present  war  declared  by  America 
*  against  Great  Britain  so  far  as  is  consistent  with  the  duty  they 
'owe  to  their  country.'  Upon  the  reading  of  this  letter  the 
council  unanimously  resolved  that  the  mayor  be  requested  to 
convey  to  the  committee  their  approbation  of  the  sentiments 
therein  contained  and  to  assure  them  that  everything  on  the 
part  of  the  city  should  be  done  to  promote  a  reciprocal  line  of 
conduct.

Alderman  Crookshank,  the  captain  of  the  artillery  was  present 
at  these  meetings.  The  government  at  that  time  took  possession 
6f  Fort  Frederick  (old  Fort  LaTour)  for  the  purposes  of  de- 
fence. Despite  the  danger  of  invasion  the  military  force  in  the 
lower  provinces  was  not  strengthened  until  1813.  In  the  early 
months  of  that  year  Sir  George  Prevost  ordered  that  the  2nd 
battalion  of  the  8th  regiment  be  sent  to  Quebec  by  the  overland 
route.  This  was  subsequently  countermanded  and  the  104th,  a 
provincial  regiment  which  had  been  raised  as  the  King's  New 
Brunswick  Regiment,  mentioned  in  the  first  chapter,  was  selected 
for  the  duty  which  was  nobly  performed.  These  gallant  fellows 
left  St.  John  in  the  bitter  cold  of  February,  18 13,  the  inhabi- 
tants assisting  them  with  sleighs  and  all  other  conveniences  at 
their  command.  Their  history  does  not  form  a  part  of  this 
narrative  as  their  services  were  rendered  in  other  than  local 
defence,  but  their  record  has  added  an  imperishable  lustre  to 
the  province  of  New  Brunswick.  It  will  be  remembered  that 
in  the  previous  September,  the  great  army  of  invasion  had  re- 
tired from  the  burning  City  of  the  North  to  perish  on  the  frost 
bound  steppes    under  the    terrible    breath   of  a  Russian  winter. 

Early  in  18 13  Sir  John  Sherbrooke  despatched  to  St.  John 
ten  24-pr.  guns  for  the  batteries  on  Partridge  Island  at 
the  entrance  to  the  harbor.  He  also  forwarded  necessary 
ammunition  and  other  requisites  besides  one  thousand  stand 
of  muskets,  but  the  ship  Diligence^  on  which  they  were 
laden  became  separated  from  H.  M.  S.  Rattler^  her  convoy,  in 
a  snow  storm  while  near  Cape  Sable.  The  Diligence  afterwards 
went  ashore  on  Beale's  Island,  about  twenty  miles  below^ 
Machias.  The  Rattler  had  four  hundred  of  the  muskets  on 
board  and  this  was  all  of  the  cargo  that  arrived  at  its  desti- 
nation.    The  poor  Diligence  with  the   remainder  of  the    stores 


28  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

fell  into  the  hands  of  the  enemy.  There  was  no  means  of  re- 
placing this  loss  and  misfortune  followed  misfortune.  A  short 
time  afterwards  the  Lady  Johnson,  a  transport  vessel  fell  into 
the  hands  of  the  French  while  on  her  way  to  Halifax  with  forty 
pieces  of  battering  cannon,  two  thousand  barrels  of  gunpowder 
and  other  stores  on  board. 

With  the  exception  of  a  list  of  officers  in  an  almanac  of 
1 812,  not  even  the  most  meagre  account  of  the  artillery  com- 
pany during  these  stirring  times  can  b/C  obtained,  but  it  is  cer- 
tain that  no  branch  of  the  militia  could  have  been  exempt  from 
the  arduous  duties  which  devolved  upon  the  citizens  at  this 
period.  The  commerce  of  the  provinces  was  exposed  to  the 
attacks  of  privateers,  and  the  Royal  Navy  brought  prize  after 
prize  into  the  colonial  ports.  There  cannot,  it  would  seem,  be 
the  slightest  doubt  but  that  the  defence  of  his  home  was  fore- 
most in  the  mind  of  every  subject,  and  that  this,  though  un- 
recorded, was  really  the  most  eventful  period  of  our  military 
history. 

Before  the  close  of  the  period  to  which  this  chapter  is  de- 
voted, two  more  references  to  military  affairs  are  to  be  found 
in  the  common  council  records.  On  the  9th  March,  18 13,  the 
freedom  of  the  city  was  granted  to  Major  Drummond,  lately 
the  commandant  of  the  troops  in  garrison  at  Fort  Howe.  He 
was  probably  of  the  8th  regiment. 

H.  Fleming  Senhouse,  commanding  H.  M.  S.  Martin  and 
senior  officer  on  this  station  solicited  the  influence  of  the  coun- 
cil among  the  proprietors  of  sleds,  etc.,  to  assist  on  their  way 
a  number  of  sailors  destined  for  the  lakes  of  Canada.  The 
board  took  the  matter  up  heartily  at  a  meeting  on  27  th  Janu- 
ary. 1 8 14,  and  employed  the  truckmen  of  the  city  to  convey 
tiu'  nien  as  far  as  Fredericton.     For  this  service  they  received 


N.    H.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  29 

the  sum  of  ten  shillings  per  man  conveyed  which  was  paid  by 
the  city. 

•July  13th,  1813,  witnessed  the  bringing  of  three  prizes  into 
the  harbor  of  St.  John  by  H.  M.  schooner  Breem,  under  com- 
mand of  Lieutenant  Charles  Hare.  This  event  and  the 
wrecking  of  H.  M.  S.  Plumper  at  Dipper  Harbor  are  referred 
to  in  the  late  J.  W.  Lawrence's  'Foot  Prints.'  In  July,  1815, 
Crookshank  &amp;  Johnston,  as  auctioneers,  offered  for  sale  the 
wreck  and  unrecovered  part  of  $70,000  in  specie  which  had 
been  destined  for  the  Commissariat,  but  had  by  accident  got 
into  the  locker  of  Davy  Jones. 

News  was  brought  to  Halifax  by  the  Empress,  packet,  which 
arrived  there  on  Saturday,  May  21st,  18 14,  after  a  passage  of 
twenty-nine  days  from  Falmouth,  that  the  allied  armies  had  en- 
tered Paris  and  restored  the  empire  of  the  Bourbons.  At  St. 
John  the  tidings  of  the  abdication  of  Napoleon  and  the  res- 
toration of  the  peace  of  Europe  were  hailed  with  delight.  On 
the  23rd  May  an  ox  was  roasted  whole,  in  King  square, 
and  the  city  was  illuminated.  The  eventful  period  in  the  his- 
tory of  St.  John  with  which  this  chapter  deals,  is  graphically 
described  in  the  recollections  of  James  Bustin,  who  was  born  in 
the  year  1800,  and  was  a  lad  in  the  days  which  he  recalls.  The 
following  extract  is  made  from  a  copy  of  his  reminiscences  which 
he  had  prepared  for  his  family,  and  for  its  reproduction  here,  as 
well  as  for  much  valuable  assistance  in  the  preparation  of  the  en- 
tire work,  the  Battalion  is  deeply  indebted  to  Clarence  Ward, 
Esq.,  a  gentleman  whose  gracefully  written  sketches  of  the  early 
history  of  the  city,  are  as  accurate  as  they  are  delightful.  Mr. 
Bustin  says :  '  The  inmates  of  the  almshouse,  (then  situated 
'where  the  Dufferin  hotel  now  stands)  had,  in  1808  to  take 
'other    quarters  for  a  short  time   there   being  an  apprehension

'  War  was  declared  by  the  United  States  against  England  in 
',1812,  this  caused  much  excitement  in  the  city,  the  old  folks 
'  had  not  forgot  the  hard  conflict  they  had  passed  through  from 
'1776  to  1783 — business  of  all  kinds  was  nearly  suspended 
'but  this  lasted  for  but  a  short  time.  The  bustle  of  prepar- 
'ation  and  the  continual  arrival  of  soldiers,  and  their  passing 
'through  on  their  way  to  Canada,  added  to  this  warships, 
'  large  and  small,  prize  vessels  sent  in,  etc.,  made  things  lively. 
'I  am  doubtful  whether  our  city  ever  had  so  much  life  or 
'business  (according  to  population)  as  she  had  during  those 
'three  years.  Our  defences  were  small,  the  Tower  in  Carleton 
'commenced  building  in  18 12  with  one  or  two  block-houses  and 
'the  remains  of  Fort  LaTour  of  historic  fame,  with  a  few  old

'side.  On  this  side  the  harbor  there  was  not  much  Sabbath 
'  for  some  time  as  all  who  were  capable  of  handling  an  axe  or 
'  an  auger  were  employed  in  fitting  up  gun  carriages  and  other 
'preparations.  Our  defences  were  from  the  heights  on  Fort 
'  Howe    hill   and  out  around   the  lower  part   of  the   city  from 

*  Battery  point  to  Reed's  point.  The  artillery  were  stationed 
'at  the  lower  cove — the  soldiers  of  the  line  stationed  at  Fort 
'Howe.     Our  militia  had  at  times  to  stand  their  draft.'

The  war  with  the  United  States  was  ended  by  the  Treaty 
of  Ghent  on  24th  December,  18 14,  but  the  desperate  battle  of 
New  Orleans  had  been  fought  before  the  people  of  Canada 
heard  that  peace  had  been  proclaimed.  It  was  not  until  the 
3rd  of  March  of  the  next  year  that  the  news  reached  Hali- 
fax. It  had  been  proclaimed  at  Washington  on  i8th  February. 
The  contest  had  been  bloody  and  exhaustive.  The  provinces 
had  borne  their  burden  manfully  and  the  long  roll  of  battles  re- 
flects even  more  credit  upon  the  raw  Canadian  militia  than  upon 
the  trained  troops  with  whom  they  co-operated.  It  was  a  strug- 
gle marked  by  incompetency  on  both  sides  almost  from  begin- 
ning to  end,  but  yet,  when  peace  was  signed,  the  Americans 
had  not  a  foothold  upon  our  soil.  Annexation,  the  fad  of  a 
few  demagogic  politicians  in  the  United  States  today,  was  a 
very  dead  thing  then.  Blood  and  treasure  were  expended  in 
vain  for.  the  accomplishment  of  that  purpose,  and  wuth  the  con- 
clusion of  the  war  of  181 2  the  opportunity  passed  away  forever. 
For  every  man  that  Canada  had  then  she  has  ten  men  today ; 
for  adhesion  she  has  cohesion  ;  for  weakness  she  has  strength. 
Day  by  day  and  year  by  year  her  attachment  to  the  British 
Crown  has  grown  and  strengthened  until  today  she  stands  the 
foremost  among  the  colonies  of  Britain.

aFTER  the  cessation  of  the  war  but  little  in  the  way  of 
history  must  be  expected  from  our  organization  until 
the  time  of  the  regimental  formation.  There  are  of 
course  the  records  of  promotions,  a  few  salutes  fired  in  com- 
memoration of  public  events  and  the  other  trivial  incidents 
which  constitute  the  history  even  of  a  regiment  of  the  line  in  a 
time  of  profound  peace.  The  militia  laws  of  this  period  did 
not  require  a  great  deal  of  service  from  the  citizen  soldiery. 
Generally  one  or  two  days  drill  by  companies  and  one  day's 
muster  by  battalions  was  considered  sufficient,  but  little  as  it 
was  this  much  was  required  until  long  after  the  formation  of 
the  regiment.  To-day  there,  are  few  incidents  in  the  routine 
of  any  corps  that  are  thought  to  be  history.  Inspections  and 
reviews,  drills  and  salutes  are  mostly  a  matter  of  course,  and 
the  writer  of  the  next  century  will  probably  think  that  we  have 
done  as  little  to  deserve  perpetuation  as  some  of  the  present 
day  may  think  our  predecessors  have  done.  Yet  they,  as  well 
as  their  successors,  did  all  that  there  was  to  be  done,  and 
though  the  record  may  appear  somewhat  barren,  yet  it  is  one 
of  which  any  soldier  may  well  be  proud,  that  of  duty  per-

The    second    captain    of    the    Artillery    Company,    Andrew 

Crookshank,  died  February  13,   181 5,  at  the  age  of  49  years. 

'  The    succession    to    the    captaincy    occasioned    considerable 

correspondence  between  Major   John   Ward,  (formerly  second 

lieutenant  in  the  company)  then  commanding  the    ist  battalion 

of    the    St.    John    County    regiment,    and    Lieutenant-Colonel 

Harris    William    Hailes,    who    was    then    administering   the 

government    of   New    Brunswick.       Since    181 2    Sir    Thomas 

Saumarez  and  General  Smyth e  had  alternately  presided  over  the 

council,  no  regular   governor   having    been    appointed.      Major 

Ward's  first  letter  is  dated  August  10,   18 16.      In  it  he  refers 

to  Lieutenant-Colonel  Wetmore  having  recommended  Craven 

Calverly    for  the    command    of   the    Artillery    company,    but 

which  that  gentleman    had   refused,    as  it  would  interfere   very 

much  with  his  private  business. 

'The  company  of  Artillery,'  he  says,  'formerly  the  most 
'respectable  in  the  regiment,  is  now  without  an  officer,  and  I 
'am  at  a  loss  whom  to  recommend  to  your  Honor.  If  it 
'should    meet    your    approbation    to    remove    Captain    James 

&lt;  Potter  from  the  Sea  Fencibles  to  the  Artillery  company,  the 
'Sea  Fencibles  would  then  have  Captain  James  Reed  with 
'them.  They  were  allowed  two  captains  on  account  of  their 
'  numbers.     David  Waterbury,  who  has  made  application  for 

&lt;  leave  to  resign,  is  out  of  town.  I  think  him  'a  proper  person 
'to  hold  a  commission  and  would  wish  an  opportunity  to 
'speak  to  him  on  the  subject  before  he  is  allowed  to  resign. 
'  If  your  Honor  thinks  proper  to  appoint  Mr.  Caleb  Ward 
'second  lieutenant  in  the  Artillery  I  think  the  company  will 
'be  well  officered.  In  compliance  with  your  Honor's  recom- 
'mendation  to  me,  I  have  issued  an  order  for  the  captains  of 
'  companies  to  receive  and  take  care  of  their  respective  com- 
'  panies'  arms  during  the  time  of  peace,  which  I  trust  will  be 
'the  means  of  preventing  any  loss  of  arms  in  the  future.' 

The  commander-in-chief  replied  approving  of  the  recommen- 
dations,   and    on    the    same    day  a   militia    general    order    was 


34  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

issued  transferring  Capt.  James  Potter  from  the  Sea  Fencibles 
to  the  Artillery  company  vice  Calverly,  whose  appointment 
was  cancelled  ;  promoting  David  Waterbury  to  be  first  lieu- 
tenant and  appointing  Caleb  Ward,  gentleman,  to  be  second 
lieutenant. 

On  the  20th  September,  1816,  Major  Ward  issued  an  order 
requesting  Captains  Humbert,  McKee  and  Potter  to  take 
charge  of  their  several  companies  agreeably  to  the  general 
order  partly  quoted  above. 

It  is,  however,  doubtful  whether  Captain  Potter  assumed 
command  of  the  company,  as  on  i8th  April,  182 1,  Major 
Ward  recommended  the  promotion  of  David  Waterbury  to 
the  captaincy  ^vice  Crookshank  deceased'  It  is  not  at  all  likely 
that  this  expression  would  have  been  used  if  Captain  Potter 
had  been  the  officer  retiring.  At  the  same  time  he  recom- 
mended the  promotion  of  Caleb  Ward  to  first  lieutenant  and 
the  appointment  of  John  C.  Waterbury  as  second  lieutenant. 
George  Shore^  then  adjutant-general,  replied  on  May  ist, 
making  the  appointments  as  desired.  The  militia  general 
orders  of  loth  August,  1821,  of  interest  to  the  artillery,  were 
as  follows : 

'  Major  Ward,  commanding  the  St.  John  militia,  having 
'expressed  a  wish  to  retire  with  his  rank,  the  corps  is  to  be 
'divided  into  two  battalions,  the  first  under  Charles  Drury, 
'Esq.,  the  second  under  command  of  Charles  Simonds,  Esq., 
'which  gentlemen  the  commander-in-chief  is  pleased  to  appoint 
'majors  commandant  of  the  same.  The  companies  at  present 
'enrolled  within  the  Umits  of  the  city,  including  the  Artil- 
'lery.  Sea  Fencibles  and  African  companies  are  to  form  the 
'  first  battalion,  the  remaining  companies  are  to  form  the  second. 
'The  commandants  will  recommend  officers  to  complete  their 
'  corps  agreeably  to  the  proportion  provided  in  the  militia  Act, 
'as    also    their    staff,    paying    every    possible   attention    to    the 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  35 

'priority    of   claims    for    rank    amongst    the   officers  at  present 
'belonging  to  their  respective  battalions.' 

George  III,  having  died  in  1820,  the  Prince  Regent  as- 
cended the  throne  as  George  IV.  The  "Courier"  of  6th 
May,  1820,  thus  describes  the  proclamation  of  the  new 
monarch  : 

'Yesterday  the  ceremony  of  proclaiming  King  George  the 
'Fourth  took  place  in  this  town,  and  we  are  warranted  in 
'saying,  that  in  no  part  of  the  provinces  has  it  been  conducted 
'with  more  zeal,  order  or  propriety.  At  half  past  ten  o'clock 
'the  militia  artillery  company  commenced  firing  minute  guns 
'which  were  continued  until  half  past  eleven.  The  colors  were 
'hoisted  half  mast  high  both  ashore  and  on  vessels  in  the  harbour. 
'The  church  bells  commenced  tolling  at  the  same  time.  The 
'procession  moved  from  the  Grammar  school  at  half  past 
'eleven,  and  proceeded  to  the  Court  house  in  slow  march  with 
'solemn  music.  It  consisted  of  the  sheriff,  coroner,  clergy, 
'magistrates,  inhabitants,  garrison  and  militia  artillery.  After 
'the  proclamation  was  read  at  the  Court  house  and  signed  by 
'the  magistrates  and  other  principal  persons,  James  Barber, 
'  Esquire,  who  was  appointed  herald,  read  it  to  the  people,  the 
'whole  of  them  being  uncovered.  They  were  the  most  num- 
'  erous  and  respectable  body  we  have  ever  seen  collected  together 
'in  this  county.  When  the  proclamation  was  concluded,  three 
'  hearty  cheers  were  given,  the  troops  presented  arms,  and  the 
'band  struck  up  "God  Save  the  King,"  the  people  still  re- 
'  maining  uncovered.  At  this  time  the  colours  were  hoisted  to 
'the  mast-head  and  the  church  bell  rang.  A  royal  salute  of 
'  twenty-one  guns  was  fired  and  the  cheering  was  repeated.  The 
'  procession  then  marched  from  the  court  house  (the  sheriff 
'and  herald  being  on  horseback)  and  proceeded  to  the  church 
'  and  other  parts  of  the  town,  when  the  proclamation  was  read 
'and  the  acclamations  continued.' 

The  sheriff  was  James  White;  the  mayor  of  the  city,  John 
Robinson,  and  the  coroner,  James  C.  F.  Bremner.  The  court 
house  was  then  on  Market  square,  and  the  only  church  bell 
was  that  in  old  Trinity.

The  coronation  of  the  new  sovereign  which  took  place  the 
following  year  was  celebrated  at  St.  John  on  24th  October,  182 1. 
A  ball  was  held  in  the  Madras  School-room,  King  square,  which 
was  attended  by  more  than  two  hundred  guests.  The  follow- 
ing day  was  the  anniversary  of  the  landing  of  the  Loyalists' 
fall  fleet.  Tables  were  set  on  the  King  square  and  three  oxen 
roasted  whole  to  the  great  delight  of  the  populace.  In  the 
evening  there  was  a  banquet,  at  which  Colonel  Charles  Drury 
presided,  and  Governor  SMythe  was  present.  A  salute  was 
fired  by  the  artillery. 

David  Waterbury,  the  third  captain,  was  born  in  Stamford, 
Conn.,  in  1758.  He  came  to  St.  John  with  the  Loyalists  in 
1783,  and  died  28th  November,  1833.  He  lived  on  Dock 
street  and  kept  a  cooper  shop  on  Nelson  street.  His  tomb- 
stone in  the  Old  Burying  Ground  has  the  simple  record  of  his 
birth-place  and  death.  He  was  often  elected  a  vestryman  of 
Trinity  church,  and  for  many  years  was  chief  of  the  Volunteer 
Fire  Company.  He  was  also  a  prominent  Free  Mason,  being 
the  second  W.  M.  of  St.  John's  Lodge,  and  the  first  of  the 
Union  Lodge  of  Portland.  The  engraving  of  Capt.  Water- 
bury  is  from  an  old  daguerrotype  given  to  the  author  by  the 
late  J.  W.  Lawrence,  Esq. 

James  Potter,  the  predecessor  of  Captain  Waterbury 
died  on  Monday,  26th  June,  1826,  after  a  few  hours  illness. 
He  was  a  retired  ship-master  and  resided  for  many  years  on 
the  east  side  of  Prince  William  street. 

Changes  in  command  were  frequent  in  those  days.  On 
September  3,  1822,  John  C.  Waterbury  was  promoted  to  the 
captaincy,  and  Thomas  T.  Hanford  and  George  Waterbury 
were  appointed  first  and  second  lieutenants  respectively.  The 
iip.pcrfect  records    of  this  period  are   assisted    by  an  advertise-

ment  of  the  ist  Battalion  St.  John  Militia  regimental  orders, 
under  the  date  19  July,  1823,  which  appears  in  the  St.  John 
"Courier."  These  orders  refer  to  the  four  officers  of  the 
Artillery  company  who  have  just  been  mentioned,  and  also 
show  that  at  that  time  there  was  a  Grenadier  company,  of 
which  Benjamin  L.  Peters;  father  of  the  late  Judge,  was 
captain ;  Alexander  Edmond,  uncle  of  the  venerable  John 
WiSHART,  who  died  in  1893,  John  R.  Partelow,  chamber- 
lain and  Mayor  of  St.  John,  and  James  H.  Fowler  were 
lieutenants.  There  were,  besides  these,  six  companies  of  the 
battalion,  a  company  of  light  infantry,  a  rifle  company  and  the 
African  Staff  company.  The  battalion  was  ordered  to  parade 
for  drill  on  Friday  the  5th  and  Saturday,  6th  September,  pre- 
paratory to  its  inspection  ordered  for  the  8th  of  that  month. 
The  commanding  officer  requested  that  the  men  of  all  com- 
panies should  appear  in  white  trowsers,  and  the  officers  were 
also  required  to  conform  to  this  regulation. 

The  74th  Regiment,  Lieutenant-Colonel  Mein  commanding, 
was  stationed  in  the  city  at  this  time.  It  left  for  Halifax  in 
July  or  August,  and  an  address  was  presented  by  the  City 
corporation  to  the  commanding  and  other  officers. 

The  legislature  was  opened  on  21st  January,  1824,  by  the 
President  of  Council,  the  Hon.  Ward  Chipman,  who  was 
administering  the  government,  pending  the  arrival  of  Sir 
Howard  Douglas.  The  President  in  his  speech  referred  to 
the  returns  of  the  inspecting  field  officers  of  the  militia  which 
would  be  laid  before  the  house,  and  from  which  additional 
proof  would  be  derived  of  the  expediency  of  a  continued 
provision  for  the  service.  Shortly  afterward  His  Honor  died, 
his  funeral  taking  place  on  February  i6th.  Preceding  the 
hearse  were    the    troops    in   garrison   at    Fredericton,  and   field 


^8  HISTORICAL    RFXORDS    OF   THE 

pieces  manned  by  the  Royal  Artillery  and  Captain  Minchin^s 
company  of  militia  Artillery,  the  whole  being  under  the  com- 
mand of  Major  McNair  of  the  52nd  Regiment,  and  forming 
the  guard  of  honor  and  firing  party. 

April  23rd  of  that  year  was  the  anniversary  of  the  tutelar  • 
Saint  of  England  and  of  the  birth  of  king  George  IV.  In 
honor  of  His  Majesty  royal  salutes  were  fired  by  the  Royal 
Artillery  at  Fort  Howe,  and  the  militia  artillery  in  Queen  square. 
The  firing  of  the  latter  was  accompanied  by  a  feu  de  joie  from 
the  52nd  Regiment  and  the  Uniform  companies  of  the  ist  and 
3rd  battalions  of  the  St.  John  Militia,  under  the  command  of 
Sir  John  M.  Tilden.     It  was  said  they  had  a  very  fine  effect. 

On  Tuesday,  24th  August,  Sir  Howard  Douglas,  the  new 
governor,  arrived  at  St.  John  in  H.  M.  S.  Satnarang.  At  one 
o'clock  the  next  afternoon  he  landed  and  proceeded  through 
an  avenue  formed  from  the  wharf  to  the  Exchange  Coffee  House 
by  two  single  ranks  of  soldiers,  composed  of  a  company  of  the 
52nd  Regiment,  under  Major  McNair,  and  the  Uniform  com- 
panies of  the  I  St  and  3rd  battalions  of  the  local  militia  under 
Major  Drury.  When  His  Excellency  left  the  ship  the  fact 
was  announced  by  a  salute  from  the  Samarang^  responded  to 
from  Fort  Howe.  On  his  landing  the  militia  artillery  fired  a 
salute  and  the  governor  was  cordially  welcomed  by  Hon.  John 
Murray  Bliss,  who  had  administered  the  government  since 
the  death  of  Judge  Chipman.  His  Excellency  was  attended 
by  the  members  of  the  executive  council,  the  mayor,  common 
council  and  magistrates  of  the  city,  and  the  heads  of  depart- 
ments. The  next  day  the  corporation  gave  a  dinner  to  Sir 
Howard  and  tendered  an  address  to  him.  The  population  of 
St.  John  at  this  time  was  about  eight  thousand  five  hundred 
people.      On    18th    September    Sir    Howard    reviewed   about 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  39 

fifteen  hundred  men  of  the  ist,  2nd  and  3rd  battaHons  of  miUtia 
under  Major  Drury.  In  a  general  order  pubUshed  a  few  days 
afterwards  His  Excellency  spoke  of  the  great  satisfaction  which 
he  had  had  in  the  review.  He  was  '  very  much  pleased  with 
'  the  Artillery  company  under  Capt.  Waterbury,  who  performed 
'  their  firing  and  movements  with  celerity  and  precision  and 
*  proved  themselves  deserving  of  all  the  encouragement  which 
'could  be  shown  to  them.'  His  Excellency  held  a  levee  in 
the  city  on  27th,  in  the  Masonic  hall,  at  which  militia  officers 
appeared  in  uniform. 

By  a  general  order  of  29th  March,  1825,  the  2nd  battalion 
was  excepted  from  an  order  of  the  24th  October,  1824,  which 
had  constituted  all  the  battalions  in  St.  John  city  and  county 
one  Regiment,  of  which  the  governor  was  colonel  and  Major 
Drury  lieutenant-colonel.  The  2nd  battalion  now  became  the 
Regiment  of  St  John  County  Militia,  and  Major  Charles 
SiMONDS  was  appointed  its  colonel  commandant.  The  annual 
inspection  took  place  on  8th  October,  and  was  followed  by  a 
dinner,  but  the  newspapers  of  the  time  do  not  give  any  details 
of  the  event.     Colonel  Love  was  the  field  officer  inspecting. 

Captain  John  C.  Waterbury  retired  on  4th  July,  1826, 
retaining  his  rank.  He  was  afterwards  County  Treasurer,  and 
died  in  the  Parish  of  Portland  on  the  9th  February,  1837, 
at  the  age  of  47  years.  Thomas  Barlow,  who  ^had  been 
appointed  first  lieutenant  on  September  8th,  182 1,  succeeded, 
on  9th  January,  1827,  to  the  command  of  the  company,  which 
he  retained  for  upwards  of  eleven  years. 

The  St.  John  "  Courier,"  printed  by  Henry  Chubb  &amp;  Co., 
contains  brief  paragraphs  referring  to  dinners  following  the 
annual  musters  of  1826  and  1827,  but  no  particulars  are 
given.     It  is  of  the  time  of  Captain  Barlow  that  the  earliest 


40  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

recollection  can  now  be  obtained  from  the  lips  of  the  living. 
John  R.  Marshall,  who,  from  1862  to  1890,  was  chief  of 
police  of  the  City  of  St.  John,  joined  Barlow's  company  in 
1830.  He  drilled  with  them  for  many  years  in  an  old  fire 
engine  house  on  Dock  street.  The  company  had  two  3-pr. 
guns,  which  were  kept  in  the  battery  at  Lower  Cove.  Chief 
Marshall  remembers,  ^s  sergeants,  James  G.  Melick  and 
Lewis  Durant,  afterwards  officers  of  the  company.  In  1838 
he  assisted  in  firing  a  salute  of  100  guns  on-  the  King  Square 
in  honor  of  the  Queen's  coronation.  He  ran  through  the 
steps  of  lance  corporal,  corporal  and  sergeant,  to  a  second 
lieutenancy,  which  he  obtained  in  1848.  His  further  pro- 
motions will  be  seen  to  have  been  of  great  importance  to  the 
present  battahon  in  the  way  of  establishing  the  continuity  of 
its  history  with  that  of  the  old  Colville  company. 

From  the  year  1830  the  first  militia  records,  regularly  kept 
as  such,  are  available.  In  all  matters  previous  to  this  old 
newspapers,  almanacs  and  correspondence  are  the  only  sources 
of  information.  Through  the  kindness  of  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Maunsell,  I).  A.  G.,  the  records  of  his  office  from  the  date 
mentioned  have  been  placed  at  the  disposal  of  the  writer,  and 
have  rendered  possible  a  task  which,  even  with  this  assistance, 
has  been  by  no  means  an  easy  one.  The  tabular  appendix 
to  this  book,  showing  the  officers  of  the  Artillery  in  all  parts 
of  the  Province,  is  as  complete  and  accurate  as  it  is  possible 
to  make  it,  but  the  sources  from  which  the  information  has 
been  derived  and  the  impossibility  in  a  great  many  cases  of 
testing  the  accuracy  of  a  statement  by  comparison  with  official, 
or  indeed  any  other  records,  render  it  impossible  to  claim  that 
it  is  more  than  approximately  correct.  Considerable  informa- 
tion has  been  obtained  regarding  the  organization  at  St.  John, 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  4I 

but  in  the  other  parts  of  the  Province  it  is  absolutely  impos- 
sible to  do  more  than  state  the  facts  collected  and  the  authority 
for  them,  leaving  the  reader  to  supplement  them  by  con- 
jecture. 

In  Charlotte  County,  as  early  as  1822,  there  appears  to  have 
been  some  artillery  in  connection  with  the  infantry  battalions. 
Attached  to  the  ist  Battalion  at  St.  Andrews  there  was  a 
Lieutenant  William  Whitlock,  whose  commission  is  dated 
27  May,  1822.  Lieutenants  Wm.  Gray  and  John  Messinett, 
date  from  loth  and  nth  March,  1828,  respectively,  and  on 
19th  May  of  the  same  year  Captain  James  Muir  appears.  He 
was  succeeded  4th  February,  1829,  by  William  Whitlock, 
and  at  this  time  Thomas  Berry  appears  as  lieutenant.  This 
company  became  a  part  of  the  regiment  in   1838. 

Some  of  the  old  almanacs  shew  a  company  attached  to  the 
2nd  battalion  of  Charlotte  county.  By  reference  to  the  names 
in  the  appendix  it  will  be  seen  that,  with  the  exception  of 
Capt.  John  Mowatt,  2nd  July,  1829,  they  and  the  dates  of 
commissions  are  the  same  as  those  of  the  ist  battalion.  It  is 
probable  that  lieutenants  Gray  and  Messinett  were  transferred 
to  the  company  with  the  2nd  battalion  when  Capt.  Whitlock 
took  command  of  the  one  in  connection  with  the  ist  battalion. 
This  company  did  not  become  a  part  of  the  regiment  until  5th 
December,   1840. 

There  was  still  another  company  of  artillery  in  Charlotte 
county  with  headquarters  at  St.  Stephen.  It  was  connected 
with  the  ist  battalion  but  on  the  4th  battalion  being  organized 
in  1835  it  was  transferred  to  the  latter.  The  first  captain  on 
the  list  is  T.  or  J  Armstrong  who  was  succeeded  by  William 
T.  Rose.  While  under  Capt.  Rose  the  company  came  into 
the  regiment.      Though  there  could  have  been  no  battery  for 


42  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

many  years,  yet  Capt.  Rose  retired  as  major  on  13th  June,. 
1866,  and  Lieutenant  Clewly  was  promoted  to  the  captaincy 
vice  Rose.     The  names  of  the  officers  are  elsewhere  stated. 

Westmoreland  county  also  appears  to  have  had  some  men 
who  could  handle  the  rattling  gun.  When  on  August  3rd,  1825, 
Sir  Howard  Douglas  visited  Sackville  the  Artillery  company, 
under  command  of  Capt.  Harris,  attached  to  the  2nd  battalion, 
fired  a  salute  of  fifteen  guns.  In  this  county  the  artillery  were 
attached  to  the  2nd  and  3rd  battalions,  a  departure  from  the 
usual  course.  The  names  of  Westmoreland  artillery  officers, 
so  far  as  known,  are  given  in  the  appendix. 

In  1825,  on  nth  July,  when  Sir  Howard  Douglas  visited 
Miramichi  a  salute  of  seventeen  guns  was  fired,  and  later  in 
the  year  troops  were  called  out  because  of  the  great  fire.  It 
does  not  appear,  however,  that  they  were  militia  artillery. 

York  county,  which  prior  to  31st  March,  1831,  included 
Carleton  county,  furnished  considerable  strength  to  the  artillery 
of  those  times — but  from  inaccuracy  in  detail  of  available  records 
it  is  difficult  to  determine  the  precise  commands  held  by  the 
officers  named  in  connection  with  it.  In  1824  Major  George 
MiNCHiN  appears,  his  commission  bearing  date  the  25th  May 
of  that  year.  In  1826  Richard  Dibblee,  then  a  merchant  of 
Fredericton,  was  lieutenant.  He  subsequently  removed  to  Wood- 
stock and  became  a  company  officer  there.  On  loth  Septem- 
ber, 1827,  Sergeant-major  James  Holbrook  was  promoted  to 
a  lieutenantcy,  and  by  orders  of  20th  March,  1832,  he  was 
appointed  to  the  captaincy  of  a  new  company,  probably  in- 
fantry. Abraham  K.  Smedes  Wetmore,  a  prominent  lawyer, 
-was  on  22nd  November,  1828,  gazetted  as  lieutenant.  He,  too, 
afterwards  removed  to  Woodstock,  and  succeeded  on  17  th 
September,    1833,    to   what   was   called   the    second    captaincy. 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  43 

which  appears  really  to  have  been  the  captaincy  of  a  second 
company.  His  predecessor  was  George  P.  Bliss,  who,  on  loth 
September,  1827,  had  been  appointed  and  now  received  a 
majority.  There  is  also  a  reference  in  militia  records  to  Capt. 
Thomas  Jones,  artillery,  3rd  York  battalion.  He  was  appointed 
on  3rd  July,   1829,  but  of  him  there  is  no  further  trace. 

John  Saunders  Shore  was  gazetted  lieutenant  on  25th 
August,  1834,  and  Donald  McLeod  on  2nd  September  in  the 
same  year.  The  former  succeeded  to  a  captaincy  on  the  death 
of  Major. Bliss,  i8th  June,  1836,  and  George  M.  Odell  was 
appointed  lieutenant  on  the  same  day.  These  officers  came 
into    the  regimental  formation  in   1838. 

In  1833  another  St.  John  company  was  formed  under  Cap- 
tain Thomas  L.  Nicholson,  with  John  Pollok,  Charters 
Simonds  and  William  Ross  as  lieutenants.  This  was  the 
Portland  company.  Nicholson  was  an  auctioneer  and  com- 
mission merchant  on  the  North  wharf;  Pollok  was  in  Robert 
Rankin  &amp;  Co.,  an  old  time  firm  of  great  repute ;  Simonds 
was  in  that  employ  and  Ross  was  a  steamboat  engineer. 
Robert  Reed,  Esq.,  who  died  a  few  years  ago,  was  afterwards, 
an  officer  in  this  company,  and  as  a  private  wa*  largely  instru- 
mental in  its  organization.  He  was  then  a  clerk  with  James 
Whitney,  the  pioneer  steamboat  owner  of  St.  John.  Shortly 
before  his  death  he  mentioned  James  Anderson  and  John 
Hopkins,  of  St.  John,  as  the  only  survivors  of  the  original 
company.  In  the  same  year  Sergeant  Robert  Robertson  and 
Charles  J.  Melick  were  appointed  second  lieutenants  in  the 
CoLViLLE  company. 

St.  John  has  always  boasted  of  a  '  Kid  Glove '  battery.  One 
was  formed  in  1834  by  the  appointment  on  26th  April  of 
William  Parker  Ranney  as  captain,    William  Hughson   as 


44  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

lieutenant,  and  Newton  Ward  Wallop,  Frederick  A.  Wig- 
gins and  Stephen  Kent  Foster  as  second  lieutenants.  This 
was  a  city  battery. 

The  city  artillery  fired  a  salute  from  King  Square  on  i8th 
May,  1833,  being  the  Jubilee  of  the  landing  of  the  Loyalists. 
The  event  was  celebrated  by  a  corporation  dinner  given  in  the 
Masonic  Hall  at  the  head  of  King  street. 

An  incident  belonging  to  this  period  may  here  be  told  as 
its  precise  date  can  not  be  ascertained.  George  F.  Thompson 
who,  in  1859,  was  appointed  to  the  Ranney  battery,  was  a 
son  of  Michael  Thompson,  a  petty  officer  in  the  Royal  Navy 
who  afterwards  held  a  position  in  H.  M.  Customs.  He  was 
born  in  181 7  and  joined  the  battery  about  1835.  Shortly  be- 
fore he  was  enrolled  he  was  one  day  watching  a  sham  fight  in 
which  Barlow's  and  Nicholson's  batteries  participated  on  op- 
posite sides.  Nicholson  was  entrenched  on  the  northward  of 
Fort  Howe  holding  the  hill  while  Barlow  was  attacking  the 
position  from  the  southward.  The  ammunition  of  the  attack- 
ing party  having  run  short,  Capt.  Barlow  came  up  to  the 
enemy's  lines  and  asked  Nicholson  for  a  supply  '  to  keep  the 
fun  going.'  'March  these  prisoners  to  the  rear!'  was  the  mili- 
tary response,  and  the  valiant  commander,  foaming  with  rage, 
was  obliged  to  submit  to  the  carrying  out  of  the  order.  He 
was  soon  released,  however,  and  with  the  desired  ammunition 
and  a  grudge  to  pay,  renewed  the  attack. 

In  the  last  year  with  which  this  chapter  deals,  the  cry  '  The 
King  is  dead,  long  live  the  Queen  !'  was  heard  throughout  the 
British  dominions,  and  ever  since  the  wish  of  length  of  days 
and  happiness  to  her  has  echoed  throughout  the  empire.

CHAPTER     V. 

1838. 

Formation  of  the  New  Brunswick  Begiment  of  Artillery — Begimental 
Officers — Companies  which  formed  the  Begiment — Sketches  of  their 
Officers — Celebration  of  the  Queen's  Coronation. 


V'I'NDER  the  system  prevailing  at  the  time,  the  companies  of 
\§\  artillery  mentioned  in  the  previous  chapter  were  not  avail- 
able for  concerted  action.  There  is  no  doubt  but  that  they 
must  have  been  very  meagrely  supplied  with  outfits,  for  in  those 
days  the  burden  of  clothing  himself  in  some  sort  of  military 
garb  was  thrown  entirely  upon  the  volunteer.  The  few  guns 
which  could  be  spared  to  the  outlying  districts  were,  however, 
probably  far  less  obsolete  than  are  those  at  present  supplied 
to  the  militia  artillery.  But  the  great  deficiency  of  the  time 
was  method.  The  companies  being  attached  to  infantry  bat- 
talions, and  there  being  no  system  of  inspection  at  all  similar 
to  that  of  the  present  time,  it  was  well  nigh  impossible  that 
uniformity  of  drill  could  be  maintained.  Nor  was  this  the 
worst  feature  of  the  administration.  If  the  services  of  the 
militia  should  at  any  time  have  been  required  the  artillery 
could  not  have  been  commanded  advantageously  by  the  infan- 
try colonels,  nor  had  they  any  officers  of  their  own  arm  who 
had  active  experience  of  the  duties  of  any  rank  above  that  of 
captain.  Had  they  been  put  in  the  field  there  was  no  officer 
qualified  for  the  work  of  looking  after  the  issue  of  those  sup- 
plies which  are  specially  required  for  artillery.  But  happily 
for  this  important    branch    of    the   service,   both  the  hour  and 


46  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

the  man  had  arrived  for  a  change  which  resulted  in  the  uniting 
of  all  the  scattered  companies  into  one  body,  and  in  giving  to 
New  Brunswick  a  regiment  which  for  upwards  of  fifty  years 
has  maintained  an  existence,  sometimes  precarious  indeed,  but 
always  continuous.  The  step  which  was  then  taken  was 
probably  accelerated  by  the  events  of  1837,  which  are  familiar 
to  all  students  of  Canadian  history.  While  the  battle  of  re- 
sponsible government  was  being  fought  in  this  province,  on 
the  floors  of  the  assembly,  hundreds  of  excited  and  reckless 
men  were  gathering  around  the  standard  of  rebellion  raised  in 
Upper  and  Lower  Canada  by  McKenzie  and  Papineau.  The 
militia  forces  of  the  Upper  Provinces  proved  quite  adequate 
to  avert  the  danger,  but  troops  of  the  line  were  hurried  for- 
ward to  the  scene  of  civil  war.  Those  stationed  in  New 
Brunswick  were  ordered  to  the  front,  and  during  their  absence 
the  mihtia  were  called  on  to  garrison  the  posts  at  Fredericton 
and  St.  John.  In  November,  1837,  the  nth,  43rd  and  83rd 
Regiments  of  the  line  were  sent  forward  on  sleds,  and  the 
militia  called  out  for  garrison  duty  were  not  relieved  until  the 
general  order  of  27th  January,  1838,  which  mentions  the 
I  St  Battalion,  York  Co.,  and  the  St.  John  City  mihtia  as  having 
taken  part  in  this  service. 

On  28th  February,  1838,  the  following  general  order  was 
issued  constituting  the  regiment : 

"His  Excellency  the  Lieutenant  Governor  and  Commander- 
"  in-chief,  considering  it  important  to  render  the  militia  artillery 
"of  the  Province  efficient  and  available  with  as  little  delay  as 
"possible,  has  been  pleased  to  appoint  Captain  Richard 
"  Hayne,  on  the  half  pay  of  the  Royal  Staff  Corps  and  for- 
"  merly  of  the  Royal  Artillery,  to  be  Lieutenant  Colonel  com- 
"mandant  of  the  said  militia  artillery.  His  Excellency  has 
"been  further  pleased  to  direct  that  this  arm  of  the  service 
"be  increased  to  ten    companies   and  formed  into  a  regiment.

and  on  25th  June  of  the  same  year  Captain  Nicholson's  com-

During  the  year  John  C.  Allen  was  appointed  second 
lieutenant  in  Captain  Shore's  company,  and  lieutenant  George 
Waterbury  of  the  Colville  company  retired  with  his  rank. 
On  1 2th  November  the  volunteers  were  again  called  out  for 
duty,  the  regulars  having  been  sent  forward  on  the  second  out- 
break of  the  Papineau  rebellion.  This  service  lasted  for  a  week 
but  it  is  not  known  what  portion  of  the  militia  was  employed. 

A  brief  sketch  of  some  of  the  first  officers  of  the  regiment 
will  be  appropriate  at  this  stage.  Others  will  be  dealt  with  on 
the  occasion  of  their  promotion  when  a  fuller  record  can  be 
given.  Of  some,  nothmg  can  be  said,  for  though  the  names 
have  a  familiar  sound  yet  their  histories  have  apparently  perished. 

Captain  Hayne,  R.  A.,  the  first  lieutenant-colonel  of  the  regi- 
ment, was  born  in  Devonshire,  England,  in  1804,  and  was 
educated  at  the  Royal  Academy,  Woolwich.  In  1820,  as  second 
lieutenant,  R.  A.,  he  went  with  Sir  Hudson  Lowe  to  St.  Helena, 
where  Napoleon  was  at  that  time  confined,  and  remained  there 
until  the  ex-emperor's  death.  In  1831  he  came  to  Canada 
with  Colonel  By,  having  been  appointed  to  the  Royal  Staff  corps, 
and  was  there  employed  on  the  Rideau  canal  and  other  en- 
gineering works.  He  went  to  England  in  1836  and  came  to 
New  Brunswick  in  the  following  year  as  commissioner  to  the 
New  Brunswick  and  Nova  Scotia  Land  company.  He  returned 
to  England  in  1870,  and  died  at  Dittesham,  Devonshire,  in  1874. 

A    daughter    of     Lieutenant-Colonel     Hayne     became     the 


50  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

wife  of  the  late  Ward  Chipman  Drury,  the  late  well  known 
registrar  of  deeds  for  the  city  and  county  of  St.  John.  His 
son,  Major  C.  W.  Drury,  of  the  Regiment  of  Canadian  Artil- 
lery, served  for  some  time  in  the  present  corps  before  receiving 
his  permanent  appointment. 

George  F.  Street,  the  first  major,  was  a  prominent  figure 
in  the  politics  of  New  Brunswick  at  this  time.  As  a  member 
of  the  '  Family  Compact '  he  was  strenuously  opposed  to  Re- 
sponsible Government,  and  in  1837,  while  a  member  of  the 
Executive  Council,  was  entrusted  by  his  colleagues  with  a 
secret  mission  to  the  Colonial  office,  having  for  its  object  the 
frustration  of  the  schemes  of  the  Reform  Party.  In  this, 
most  fortunately  for  the  future  good  government  of  the  pro- 
vince, he  was  unsuccessful.  He  was  a  son  of  Samuel  Denny 
Street,  who  in  1781  was  on  service  at  Fort  Howe,  and 
afterwards  settled  in  Sunbury  County.  Major  Street  was  one 
of  the  principals  in  a  celebrated  duel  fought  on  October  2nd, 
182 1.  On  leaving  court  at  Fredericton  an  altercation  occurred 
between  him  and  George  Ludlow  Wetmore,  father  of  the 
late  Mr.  Justice  Wetmore.  A  challenge  followed,  and  the 
parties,  accompanied  by  Lieutenant  R.  Davis  of  the  74th 
Regiment  and  John  H.  Winslow,  met  at  Maryland  Hill. 
The  result  was  fatal  to  Mr  Wetmore,  and  the  surviving  prin- 
cipal with  the  seconds  fled  from  justice.  They  afterwards 
surrendered  themselves  and  were  tried  on  the  22  nd  February 
following  before  Judge  Saunders,  when  they  were  acquitted 
for  want  of  sufficient  proof  of  identity. 

John  Saunders  Shore  was  a  son  of  George  Shore,  the 
adjutant-general.  He  afterwards  went  into  the  24th  Regiment, 
and  on  13th  January,  1849,  was  killed  at  Chillian walla,  a  town 
of  British  India  in  the  Punjab  situated  on  the  left  bank  of  the 


N.    v..    GARRISON    ARTir,LERV.  5 1 

river  Jhelum,  in  a  conflict  between  the  British  forces  com- 
manded by  Lord  Gough  and  an  army  of  Sikhs  under  Shere 
Singh.  An  obelisk  was  erected  at  the  place  bearing  the  names 
of  the  officers  and  men  who  fell  in  the  action. 

Of  the  St.  John  officers  George  Waterbury  was  a  merchant 
on  Nelson  Street;  Robert  Robertson  was  a  sailmaker,  and 
Charles  J.  Melick  a  tanner.  The  sword  of  lieutenant,  after- 
wards Major  Melick,  was  in  the  possession  of  the  late  Robert 
Reed,  Esq. 

William  Parker  Ranney  was  of  the  firm  of  Ranney  &amp; 
Sturdee,  wholesale  wine  merchants ;  William  Hughson  was  a 
merchant,  and  Fred  A.  Wiggins  was  a  son  of  the  benevolent 
founder  of  the  Wiggins'  Orphan  Institution  of  St.  John.  The 
life  of  Stephen  Kent  Foster  was  so  largely  identified  with 
the  corps  that  it  must  be  dealt  wnth  elsewhere.  Newton 
Ward  Wallop  was  a  grandson  of  the  veteran  Major  John 
Ward  and  son  of  Barton  Wallop,  a  naval  officer,  grandson 
of  the  second  Earl  of  Portsmouth.  Newton  Wallop  and 
his  brother  Barton  had  a  thrilling  experience  in  their  boy- 
hood to  which  an  allusion  was  previously  made.  They  acci- 
dentally caused  the  death  of  Daniel  DeVoe,  one  of  the 
signers  of  the  first  muster  roll  of  the  Artillery  company. 
DeVoe  had  been  in  a  company  which  served  on  the  Royalist 
side  in  the  American  Revolution,  and  was  commanded  by 
John  Ward,  the  grandfather  of  the  boys.  On  the  13th  June, 
1 8 18,  DeVoe,  then  an  old  man,  was  going  to  his  home  on 
King  street,  and  in  doing  so  had  to  pass  the  residence  of 
Charles  Ward  where  the  lads  were  playing.  They  had  dis- 
covered their  uncle's  horse  pistols  which  he  had  left  upon  a 
table  on  returning  from  militia  training.  Not  knowing  that  they 
were  loaded  they  pointed  them  at  each  other  and  snapped  the 


52  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

flints  without  effect.  Barton,  seeing  the  old  man  coming  up 
the  street,  aimed  at  him  and  pulled  the  trigger,  when  the 
pistol  went  off  and  DeVoe  fell  dead.  The  lads  were  taken 
into  custody  and  an  inquest  was  held,  which  exonerated  them. 

Captain  Nicholson  of  the  company  which  was  long  after- 
wards known  by  his  name,  was,  to  use  the  words  of  Mr. 
Robert  Reed,  *a  sterling  man.'  His  daughter  is  Lady 
Ritchie,  widow  of  the  late  Sir  William  J.  Ritchie,  who  was 
Chief  Justice  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Canada.  Lieutenant 
John  C.  Allen,  who  afterwards  became  adjutant  of  the  regi- 
ment, is  now  Sir  John  C.  Allen,  the  honored  Chief  Justice  of 
New  Brunswick.  He  was  born  October  i,  1817,  of  Loyalist 
descent,  his  grandfather  having  been  Isaac  Allen  of  Trenton, 
New  Jersey,  who  was  a  judge  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  New 
Brunswick  from  its  erection  until  his  death  in  1806.  Sir 
John's  life  has  been  an  active  one.  He  was  admitted  to  the 
bar  of  his  native  province  in  1838,  and  rose  rapidly,  filling 
the  offices  of  solicitor  and  attorney  general,  and  eventually  ob- 
taining a  seat  on  the  bench  in  1865.  Ten  years  later,  on  the 
promotion  of  Sir  William  J.  Ritchie  to  the  Chief  Justice- 
ship of  Canada,  he  became  Chief  Justice  of  New  Brunswick, 
and  in  1889  was  knighted.  At  the  time  of  the  Papineau 
rebellion  he  was  a  bombardier  and  did  garrison  duty  with  his 
company. 

The  annual  dinner  of  St.  George's  Society  at  St.  John  in 
1838,  held  on  the  day  of  the  patron  Saint,  was  an  event  of 
unusual  importance,  as  it  was  the  first  since  the  accession  of 
Her  Majesty  to  the  throne.  On  the  president  rising  to  pro- 
pose the  Sovereign's  health  a  royal  salute  was  fired  by  Captain 
Ranney's  company  from  the  King  square.  It  was  received 
with  enthusiastic  applause  by  the  guests  at  the  banquet  which

was  given  in  the  St.  John  Hotel,  then  on  the   corner  of  King 
and  Charlotte  streets. 

A  contemporary  account  of  the  celebration  of  the  Queen's 
coronation,  28  June,  1838,  says  that  'a  volunteer  company  of 
artillery  under  the  command  of  Lieutenants  Foster  and  Wiggins 
paraded  the  streets  with  their  field  pieces,  preceded  by  a 
band,  and  at  nine  o'clock  went  through  their  exercises 
on  King  square.  At  eleven  o'clock  the  nth  Regiment,  then 
in  garrison  at  St.  John,  under  command  of  Colonel  Goldie, 
and  the  Royal  Artillery,  under  command  of  Captain  Arm- 
strong, turned  out  in  parade  upon  the  Barrack  Square,  where, 
at  the  cordial  invitation  of  Colonel  Goldie,  they  were  joined 
by  the  militia  companies.  At  noon  a  royal  salute  was  fired, 
and  a  feu  de  joie  given  in  fine  style  ;  and  then  the  soldiers 
went  through  various  evolutions  admirably,  while  the  regiment's 
excellent  band  played  delightfully.  There  was  a  corporation 
dinner  at  six  o'clock  in  the  City  Hall  and  a  ball  and  supper 
at  night  in  the  St.  John  Hotel,  which  was  well  attended.  On 
the  Carleton  side  of  the  river  royal  salutes  were  fired  in 
good  style  during  the  day.'

tJy^  have  now  arrived  at  a  period  in  the  history  of  this 
XXj  province  when  the  maintenance  of  the  rights  of  its 
inhabitants  endangered  the  peace  of  the  empire.  Since 
the  war  of  181 2  a  gradual  change  had  taken  place  in  the  re- 
lations between  New  Brunswick  and  the  neighboring  State  of 
Maine.  At  that  time  the  influence  of  the  New  England  States 
had  been  exerted  against  a  rupture  with  Great  Britain  because 
of  the  kindly  feelings  which  prevailed  between  the  colonies  and 
those  states,  but  during  the  quarter  of  a  century  which  followed 
that  effusive  protestation  of  friendship  the  aspect  of  affairs  had 
materially  changed.  Our  warmest  neighbors  had  become  our 
bitterest  foes,  while  in  Washington,  where  the  Capitol  had 
been  burned  by  British  soldiers,  a  more  moderate  and  pacific 
tone  prevailed.  The  cause  of  the  rupture  was  one  of  the 
commonest  in  country  districts — it  was  the  old  trouble  about 
a  line  fence.  In  this  case  it  was  not,  of  course,  the  division 
line  between  farms,  but  states.  For  many  years  the  State  of 
Maine  had  claimed  that  their  boundary  lay  further  eastward 
than  that  admitted  by  the  British  government.  The  treaty  of 
Paris,  made  in  1783,  had  divided  the  territories  by  a  Une  drawn 
from  the  source  of  the  St.  Croix  river  to  the  "  highlands  dividing 


N.    B.    GARRISON   ARTILLERY.  55 

the  waters  falling  into  the  Atlantic  from  those  emptying  them- 
selves into  the  St.  Lawrence."  In  1798  a  decision  had  been 
given  favorable  to  the  contention  of  Great  Britain — that  the 
Schoodiac  river  was  the  St.  Croix  of  the  treaty,  but  the  situa- 
tion of  the  highlands  remained  undetermined.  Upon  the 
settlement  of  this  question  depended  the  ownership  of  a  large 
tract  of  valuable  timber  land.  For  many  years  the  mat- 
ter was  debated  in  the  Maine  legislature,  and  session  after 
session  the  feeling  ran  high.  In  1831  the  King  of  the 
Netherlands  had,  as  arbitrator,  given  a  decision,  but  the 
United  States  refused  to  be  bound  by  the  aw^ard.  When  the 
Papineau  insurrection  broke  out^  that  rebel  had  the  sympathy 
and  support  of  many  on  the  American  side  of  the  line,  and 
nothing  was  asked  but  the  most  trivial  pretext  to  warrant  the 
people  of  Maine  commencing  hostilities.  A  community  does 
not  usually  have  long  to  wait  for  such  a  chance,  and  the  *  Dis- 
puted Boundary'  question,  as  it  was  called,  was  precipitated 
into  the  'Aroostook  war '  by  a  small  event.  In  January,  1839, 
about  150  men  from  Maine  made  a  raid  into  the  debatable 
country  and  seized  some  timber  which  had  been  cut  by  New 
Brunswick  lumbermen.  Instantly  both  countries  were  ablaze 
with  a  desire  for  war.  McIntyre,  the  Maine  land  agent, 
and  two  men  who  were  with  him  were  seized  and  carried  to 
the  gaol  at  Fredericton.  Governor  Fairfield,  of  Maine,  ordered 
the  State  militia  to  march  forward.  Major-General  Sir  John 
Harvey,  governor  of  New  Brunswick,  issued  a  proclamation 
asserting  the  rights  of  Great  Britain  to  occupy  and  preserve 
order  in  the  territory  until  the  dispute  should  be  settled  by 
some  international  arbitration.  In  moderate  but  earnest  language 
he  requested  Governor  Fairfield  to  withdraw  his  troops.  This 
gentleman  who  seems  to  have  been  anxious  to  have  a  war  a 


56  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

any  cost  answered  Governor  Harvey's  demand  by  calling  for 
more  troops  to  the  number  of  ten  thousand  men.  Sir  John 
acted  promptly.  He  despatched  ninety  men  of  the  36th  regi- 
ment then  at  Fredericton,  under  Colonel  Maxwell,  to  Wood- 
stock. On  13th  February  a  draft  was  ordered  from  the  ist 
and  2nd  battalions  of  the.Carleton  county  mihtia.  A  request 
for  troops  was  sent  to  Sir  John  Colborne,  the  commander  in 
Upper  Canada.  The  militia  of  St.  John  volunteered ;  the  first 
to  come  forward  being  fifty  men  of  the  Highland  company 
under  Captain,  afterwards  the  Hon.  John  Robertson.  A  draft 
was  made  on  the  militia  in  that  city,  one  company  of  seventy- 
five  men  being  taken  from  the  ist  battalion  and  another  of 
equal  strength  from  the  rifle  battalion.  These  men  did  garrison 
duty  during  the  absence  of  the  regulars  from  the  city.  The 
regiment  of  Artillery  volunteered  its  services  which  were  ac- 
cepted by  the  following  order : —

Militia  General  Order : — 

His  Excellency  the  Lieutenant  Governor  and  Commander- 
in  chief,  having  accepted  the  voluntary  offer  of  service  of  the 
New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery,  has  been  pleased  to 
order  into  actual  service  one  officer,  two  non-commissioned 
officers  and  nine  gunners  per  company  (together  with  the  ad- 
jutant) at  each  of  the  following  stations,  viz.  :  Fredericton, 
Woodstock,  Saint  John  and  Saint  Andrews. 

Lieutenant-Colonel  Hayne  will  be  pleased  to  take  immedi- 
ate steps  for  carrying  this  arrangement  into  effect. 

By  command,

On  the  23rd  March  a  detachment  of  the  Artillery  consisting 
of  one  officer,  five  non-commissioned  officers  and  sixteen  gun- 
ners with  two  light  3-pr.  militia  guns  and  sufficient  ammunition 
were  ordered  to  proceed  to  Woodstock  on  the  following  Mon- 
day. This  detachment  was  placed  under  the  command  of 
Major  Stow,  R.  A. 

In  this  time  of  danger  the  people  of  New  Brunswick  had 
the  hearty  support  of  the  legislature  of  Nova  Scotia,  which 
voted  ^100,000  for  assistance  if  needed.  The  assembly 
chamber  resounded  with  cheers  when  this  vote  was  given, 
which  were  re-echoed  in  the  parliament  buildings  at  Frederic- 
ton  when  the  news  of  the  generous  act  was  received  there. 
New  Brunswick  placed  all  her  revenues  at  the  disposal  of  the 
governor.  The  City  of  St.  John  voted  ;£"i,ooo  for  the  main- 
tenance of. the  families  of  the  volunteers  while  the  militia  were 
at  their  posts.  Sir  John  Colborne  responded  promptly  sending 
the  nth  Regiment  under  Colonel  Goldie.  The  troops  were 
drawn  up  on  the  frontier  awaiting  the  signal  for  combat.  But 
Sir  John  Harvey  was  a  diplomat  as  well  as  a  soldier,  and 
despite  the  blusterings  of  the  great  Daniel  Webster,  the  rep- 
resentations of  the  British  minister  at  Washington  swayed  the 
policy  of  the  administration  toward  peace.     General   Winfield

Scott,  who  had  fought  against  Sir  John  Harvey  at  Lundy's 
Lane,  was  sent  to  the  border  to  take  command  of  the  state 
troops.  The  two  old  opponents  met,  talked  the  matter  over 
quiedy,  and  as  a  result  Governor  Fairfield  was  compelled  to 
withdraw  his  troops. 

The  following  order  was  issued  upon  the  settlement  of  the 
dispute  and  the  consequent  withdrawal  of  the  American  forces  : 

Woodstock,  March  27th,   1839. 
Militia   General  Order  : — 

The  governor  of  the  State  of  Maine  having  issued  his  orders 
for  the  immediate  withdrawal  of  the  armed  militia  force  from 
the  disputed  territory,  Major-General  Sir  John  Harvey  is  happy 
to  permit  their  return  to  their  homes  of  the  militia  and  volun- 
teer force  of  this  province,  of  whose  services  he  had  felt  it 
proper  to  avail  himself  during  the  late  border  differences ;  the 
arrangements  for  their  disbandment  will  be  promulgated  in  a 
militia  general  order. 

In  making  this  communication  the  Major-General  and  Lieu- 
tenant-Governor desires  to  express  to  the  whole  of  the  provincial 
force  now  on  duty  the  highest  degree  of  satisfaction  which  he 
has  derived  from  the  reports  which  have  been  made  to  His 
Excellency  of  the  general  exemplary  conduct,  and  particularly 
of  the  desire  which  has  been  very  generally  manifested  by  them 
to  avail  themselves  of  the  opportunities  which  have  been  af- 
forded to  them  of  gaining  a  knowledge  of  their  military  duties, 
under  the  instruction  of  officers  and  non-commissioned  officers 
of  Her  Majesty's  service — whose  willing  attention  and  unwearied 
patience  in  affording  that  instruction  will,  the  Lieutenant-Gover- 
nor is  persuaded,  be  gratefully  recognized  by  the  militia  of  that 
province. 

To  Her  Majesty's  regular  troops  the  Major-General  tenders 
his  sincere  thanks  for  their  general  excellent  conduct,  and 
for  the  cheerfulness  with  which  they  have  met  the  discom- 
forts and  inconveniences  inseparable  from  military  movements 
in  such  a  climate  and  in  such  a  season  of  the  year ;  and 
the  fact  of  their  having  continued  in  so  perfectly  healthy  a 
state,  the    Major-General    is    justified   in   imparting    wholly    to 


N.    15.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  59 

their  uniform  steadiness,  sobriety  and  good  conduct,  and  to 
their  unshaken  determination  to  do  their  duty  to  their  Queen 
and  country. 

The  zeal,  judgment  and  ability  evinced  by  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Maxwell  claim  the  Major-General's  warmest  thanks  which  he 
likewise  begs  to  offer  to  the  officers  commanding  corps  and 
detachments-— to  the  several  officers  in  command  of  detached 
posts — to  the  staff  and  departmental  officers,  and  to  all  who 
by  their  zealous  exertions  and  excellent  arrangements  have  con- 
tributed to  the  soldiers'  comfort  and  efficiency,  and  subsequently 
to  the  promotion  of  the  objects  of  the  service  for  which  the 
troops  have  been  assembled. 

The  Major-General  cannot  allow  the  force  under  Colonel 
GoLDiE  to  return  to  Canada  without  tendering  to  the  Colonel 
and  the  officers  and  soldiers  of  the  nth  Regiment  and  Royal 
Artillery  under  his  command,  his  cordial  thanks  for  their  zealous 
co-operation  in  a  service  which  has  subjected  them  to  a  long 
and  arduous  winter  movement. 

By  command,

Thus  by  the  prompt  action  and  wise  judgment  of  one  man 
a  war  was  averted  which  would  have  entailed  much  distress 
upon  both  countries,  and  whose  results  would,  in  all  proba- 
bility, have  affected  the  present  generation.  Mr.  George  F. 
Thompson,  of  Saint  John,  who  had  joined  Barlow's  company 
about  1834  or  1835,  recalls  the  time  when  he  was  on  duty  on 
this  occasion.  The  detachment  from  this  company  did  three 
days  garrison  duty  and  was  held  ready  for  orders  for  a  week 
afterwards.  The  three  companies,  Barlow's,  Nicholson's  and 
Ranney's  were  very  strong,  numbering  at  this  time  about  four 
hundred  men,  all  uniformed  at  their  own  expense.  Mr.  Robert 
Reed,  another  old  artilleryman,  also  remembers  that  the  three 
St.  John  companies  agreed  to  do  a  fortnight's  duty  alternately. 
His,  the  Nicholson  company,  were  marching  down  St.  James 


6o  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

Street,  on  their  way  to  the  barracks,  when  a  messenger  brought 
the  word  that  '  the  war  was  over.'  They  continued  doing  duty 
until  the  next  day  when  they  were  discharged. 

At  Fredericton  both  companies  contributed  to  the  service. 
Captain  Berton,  with  twenty-five  or  thirty  men,  was  sent  for- 
ward to  Woodstock,  where  he  remained  for  about  two  months, 
while  Captain  Shore's  company  did  garrison  duty  in  the  bar- 
racks at  Fredericton.  The  Woodstock  company  was,  of  course, 
on  duty.  By  an  order  of  30th  March,  1839,  all  the  volunteers 
were  relieved  from  further  duty,  and  this  brief  and  bloodless 
campaign  was  closed. 

In  closing  the  record  of  this  year  the  following  sketch  of  a 
sham  fight,  taken  from  the  "Weekly  Observer,"  a  St.  John 
newspaper  of  that  period,  may  be  considered  appropriate  and 
interesting. 

The  following  is  the  programme  of  the  sham  fight  which 
took  place  on  Tuesday  last  (r2th  November): 

The  troops  were  formed  in  column  of  companies  in  King's 
square.  The  enemy  was  represented  by  three  divisions  of  the 
69th  Regiment,  three  companies  of  militia  and  two  companies 
of  militia  artillery — the  whole  under  the  immediate  command 
of  Captain  O'Halloran,  69th  Regiment.  In  continuation  of 
the  manoeuvres  performed  on  the  ist  instant,  it  was  supposed 
that  the  right  of  the  enemy's  rear  guard  was  in  position 
covering  their  retreat  and  passage  over  the  river  on  pontoons 
at  Indiantown.  The  position  taken  up  with  this  object  was 
as  follows :  The  right  resting  upon  the  heights  rising  in  rear 
of  the  road  passing  by  the  ship  yard  to  the  short  ferry,  and 
flanked  by  the  river ;  their  centre  on  the  continuation  of  the 
ridge  extending  across  the  high  road  to  Indiantown,  occupying 
the  vicinity  of  the  church  on  the  left  of  it  in  force ;  their  left 
resting  on  the  small  fir  wood  and  ravine  flanked  by  the 
morass  which  extends  from  the  rear  of  Fort  Howe  in  that 
direction.  The  enemy  having  an  outpost  on  the  heights  of 
Fort  Howe,  and  also  a  detached  picquet  in  advance  of  their 
centre  to  watch  the  bridge  of   Portland  and  the  roads  leading 


N.    B.    GARRISON    x\RTILLERY.  6 1 

thence  to  the  city,  and  also  having  videttes  on  the  high 
ground  above  Portland  to  give  information  of  any  movement 
m  their  front  ;  a  picquet  was  also  sent  a  little  in  advance  of 
the  left  to  watch  that  part  of  the  ravine  which  debouches  on 
the  morass. 

The  attacking  force,  under  the  command  of  Major  Brookes 
of  the  69th  Regiment,  advanced  in  two  columns,  the  right  by 
the  road  in  rear  of  the  Attorney  General's  house,  to  the  pass 
leading  to  Fort  Howe  After  possessing  itself  of  this,  and 
leaving  a  division  to  attack  the  heights  in  front,  it  proceeded 
under  cover  of  the  broken  ground  and  the  wood  to  the 
left  of  the  Kennebeccasis  road,  to  gain  a  passage  at  the  head 
of  the  morass.  This  having  been  effected,  it  continued  to 
skirt  the  opposite  side  of  the  morass  till  it  arrived  where  the 
Indiantown  mill-stream  empties  itself,  when  it  halted.  The 
left  column  proceeded  by  Union  street  to  the  head  of  Port- 
land Bridge.  When  the  skirmishers  of  the  right  column 
commenced  their  attack  on  the  enemy's  outposts  on  the 
heights,  the  l^ft  passed  the  bridge,  driving  back  the  enemy's 
picquet,  which,  after  exchanging  a  few  shots  with  the  skirmishers, 
retired.  The  column  then  proceeded  up  the  main  street  of 
Portland  until  it  arrived  at  the  point  where  it  is  intersected  by 
the  road  leading  to  the  river  and  that  leading  up  to  Fort 
Howe,  where  it  divided,  one  division  of  it  being  detached  and 
posted  on  the  lower  road  running  parallel  with  the  river,  near 
the  shipyards,  the  others  remaining  in  rear  of  the  buildings  to 
the  left  of  the  high  road  to  Indiantown.  When  the  skirmishers 
of  the  right  column  had  possessed  themselves  of  the  heights 
of  Fort  Howcy  captured  the  guns  planted  there,  and  turned' 
them  on  the  enemy,  the  left  commenced  a  sharp  skirmish  with 
the  enemy,  and  drove  them  back  from  the  shipyards  and 
buildings  in  front  of  their  position.  Having  succeeded  in  this, 
it  then  attempted  to  force  the  right  and  centre  of  the  position, 
but  this  attack,  from  the  heavy  fire  of  the  Artillery  and 
musquetry  and  the  natural  strength  of  the  ground,  did  not 
succeed ;  the  attacking  party  falling  back  followed  by  the  enemy 
to  the  ground  they  occupied  previous  to  the  attack,  which  they 
maintained.  The  attack  on  the  right  and  centre  having  failed, 
the  right  column  (which  had  now  arrived  on  the  extreme  left 
of    the    enemy),    after    crossing    the  mill-stream    commenced  a 


62  HISTORICAL    RPXORDS    OF   THE 

vigorous  attack  upon  it,  and  having  gained  possession  of  the 
fir  wood  and  crossed  the  head  of  the  ravine,  turned  the 
position,  and  continued  the  attack  by  echelon  movement  to 
their  right,  gained  the  high  road  and  cut  off  the  retreat  of  the 
enemy  from  their  supposed  pontoon  bridge  at  Indiantown.  In 
the  meantime  the  left  column  having  made  dispositions  pre- 
paratory to  a  renewed  attack  upon  the  centre  and  right,  which 
it  commenced  as  soon  as  it  was  perceived  that  the  enemy's 
left  had  been  turned,  and  after  a  severe  contest  it  gained  the 
heights  and  captured  the  enemy's  guns,  who  being  thus  de- 
feated and  cut  off  from  the  main  body  fell  back  on  the  ridge 
in  rear  of  the  grave  yard,  and  their  whole  force  being  thrown 
on  the  peninsula  formed  by  the  bend  of  the  river,  and  without 
the  means  of  escape,  surrendered.

CHAPTER     VII. 

I 840-1 843. 

Decline  of  the  Old  Militia  System — Celebration  oj  the  Queen's  Mar- 
riage—  Opening  of  the  Mechanics'"  Institute — Jubilee  of  the  Artillery 
— Address  to  Major  Ward — His  Beply — Sketch  of  his  Life. 


HIS  chapter  opens  with  the  year  in  which  began  the  de- 
cadence of  the  old  militia  system  of  the  province— a 
system  which  had  few  merits  and  almost  innumerable 
defects.  Yet  it  served  the  necessity  of  the  times  fairly  well, 
and  for  many  years  after  its  growing  inadequacy  had  been 
recognized  it  kept  a  place  in  the  affairs  of  the  country  for  want 
of  a  better  substitute.  Like  all  things  which  become  obsolete 
its  decline  was  gradual,  and  the  history  of  the  transition  from 
it  to  the  succeeding  system  must  be  postponed  to  a  later  chapter. 
Suffice  it  to  say  here  that  the  end  had  begun. 

The  year  1840  witnessed  the  promotion  of  Lieutenant  John 
C.  Allen  to  the  adjutancy,  and  the  addition  to  the  regiment 
of  Captain  Mowatt's  company  of  Charlotte  county  artillery. 
In  July  of  this  year  an  almost  triumphal  reception  was  ac- 
corded to  the  new  governor-general,  Right  Hon.  C.  P.  Thomp- 
son. He  was  received  with  a  salute  of  nineteen  guns  from 
the  Royal  Artillery,  and  passed  through  the  assembled  trades 
on  Prince  William  street.  A  portion  of  the  New  Brunswick 
Regiment  of  Artillery  was  stationed  *on  the  King  square,  and 
fired  a  salute  as  His  Excellency  entered  the  court  house.  He 
.afterwards  reviewed  the  militia  from  the    St.  John  Hotel,  then

kept  by  the  Messrs.  Scammell.  On  February  loth  of  the  suc- 
ceeding year  a  splendid  ball  was  given  by  the  officers  of  the 
several  battalions  of  the  militia  of  the  city  and  county  of  St. 
John.  It  was  held  at  the  St.  John  Hotel  in  honor  of  the 
anniversary  of  Her  Majesty's  marriage,  which  was  also  the  day 
fixed  for  the  christening  of  the  Princess  Royal.  The  band  of 
the  69th  Regiment  furnished  music  on  this  occasion. 

A  second  major  was  appointed  to  the  artillery  in  this  year 
in  the  person  of  Thomas  L.  Nicholson  who  has  been  mentioned 
before  in  connection  with  the  formation  of  his  company.  Capt. 
Ranney  resigned  about  the  same  time  and  the  vacancy  so 
caused  was  filled  by  the  promotion  of  Lieutenant  S.  K.  Fos- 
ter. By  some  oversight  no  quartermaster  had  yet  been  ap- 
pointed to  the  new  regiment  but  E.  B.  Peters  was  gazetted 
to  the  position  on  26th  April.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Hayne  was 
appointed  provincial  A.  D.  C.  to  His  Excellency  on  7th  May, 
and  James  F.  Berton  succeeded  G.  F.  S.  Berton,  deceased, 
in  the  captaincy  of  the  company  at  Fredericton. 

On  Thursday,  12th  August,  the  ist  Battalion  of  city  militia 
under  Lieutenant-Colonel  Peters,  and  the  three  St.  John 
companies  of  the  Regiment  of  Artillery  commenced  the  annual 
training.  On  the  following  Tuesday  the  inspection  took  place, 
and  a  set  of  handsome  colors  was  presented  to  the  ist  Bat- 
talion. The  drill  served  as  good  preparation  for  the  pleasing 
duty  which  a  portion  of  the  artillery  had  next  to  perform. 
His  Excellency  Sir  William  Colebrooke  and  suite  landed  at 
Indiantown  about  eight  o'clock  on  the  i6th  August,  and  were 
received  by  Captain  Foster's  Artillery  coinpany  and  the  Irish 
Royals,  under  Captain  EVrury,  as  a  guard  of  honor.  As  the 
governor  left  the  steamer  the  Pordand  militia  band  struck  up 
the    National    Anthem    and    the    artillery    fired    the  customary 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  65 

salute.  On  arriving  at  the  St.  John  hotel  His  Excellency  was 
received  by  a  guard  of  honor  of  the  36th  Regiment,  and 
another  salute  was  fired  by  Captain  Robertson's  Artillery 
company  which  was  stationed  on  the  King  square. 

The  birth  of  the  Prince  of  Wales  was  celebrated  on  the 
8th  December  by  the  Royal  troops  firing  a  salute,  but  the 
newspapers  do  not  state  whether  there  was  any  demonstration 
by  the  militia. 

On  the  17  th  August  of  the  next  year  a  bazaar  and  exhibition 
was  held  in  the  Mechanics'  Institute  under  the  patronage  of 
Lady  Colebrooke.  Upon  the  opening  an  address  was  read 
by  Vice-President  Jack  and  Sir  William  read  an  answer  on 
behalf  of  Lady  Colebrooke.  As  Her  Ladyship  entered  the 
hall  a  royal  salute  was  fired  by  a  detachment  of  the  artillery 
under  Major  Nicholson,  and  the  National  Anthem  was  played 
by  the  band  of  the  30th  Regiment.  It  is  interesting  to  note 
that  among  the  articles  exhibited  were  working  models  of  a 
steam  engine  projected  by  Lewis  W.  Durant  and  manufac- 
tured by  him  and  James  G.  Melick.  The  exhibition  was  on 
quite  a  large  scale  for  those  days.  It  aspired  to  the  dignity 
of  a  picture  gallery  in  which  the  place  of  honor  was  assigned 
to  the  portrait  of  Major  Ward. 

In  September  of  this  year  Major  Lock's  company  of  Royal 
Artillery,  then  at  St.  John,  was  relieved  by  a  detachment  under 
Captain  Tuite.  On  the  12th  of  the  month  the  St.  John 
division  of  militia  artillery  assembled  for  drill. 

The  next  year's  militia  orders  show  Charles  J.  Melick  to 
have  succeeded  to  the  command  of  the  old  company  of  1793, 
which  was  about  to  celebrate  its  jubilee.  The  orders  also 
note  that  in  August  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery 
subscribed    the    sum    of    ^9    toward    the    rebuilding    of    the 


66  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

monument  to  Sir  Isaac  Brock.  This  year  was  destined  to 
be  ever  memorable  in  the  history  of  our  corps.  Though  since 
that  time  the  records  of  its  early  history  have  been  almost 
entirely  destroyed  by  the  many  terrible  fires  which  have  de- 
vastated the  City  of  St.  John,  yet  the  celebration  of  the  i8th 
of  May  of  that  year  has  put  beyond  all  doubt  the  fact  that 
the  original  company  had  maintained  a  continuous  existence. 
For  some  time  previous  to  that  loyal  anniversary  paragraphs 
appeared  in  the  St.  John  newspapers  intimating  that  the  day 
would  be  especially  commemorated  in  connexion  with  the 
Artillery  company  and  its  only  surviving  officer,  Major  Ward. 
The  events  of  the  day  can  better  be  related  by  the  following 
extract  from  the  St.  John  "Courier"  of  the  20th  May,  than 
by  any  paraphrase  made  by  one  who  has  no  other  knowledge 
of  the  time  : 

Landing  of  the  Loyalists. 

the  fiftieth  anniversary  of  the  formation  of  the 

First  Artillery  Company. 

Thursday,  the  i8th  May,  being  the  day  appointed  by  our 
good  and  loyal  citizens  for  celebrating  the  above  anniversary — 
the  morn  was  ushered  in  by  a  salute  on  King  square,  and  by 
the  displaying  of  the  "  Union  and  Cross  "  on  the  various  build- 
ings and  shipping  in  the  harbor,  the  sun  shone  forth  in  unclouded 
splendor — not  a  cloud  intervened  to  darken  the  approaching 
festivities — every  heart  beat  high  in  anticipation  of  the  events, 
and  all  seemed  to  hail  the  commemoration  of  so  memorable  an 
occasion  with  feelings  of  pleasure,  satisfaction   and   enjoyment. 

The  uniform  companies  of  our  gallant  militia  were  on  the 
field  at  eleven  o'clock  precisely,  under  the  command  of  their 
respective  officers,  who  seemed  to  vie  with  each  other  in  the 
neatness  of  their  military  costumes  and  the  regularity  and  cor- 
rectness of  the  movements  of  their  men. 

At  twelve  o'clock  an  address  was  delivered  by  Major  Nichol- 
son, of  the  New  Brunswick  Artillery,  to  Major  Ward,  the 
Father  of  the  city,  and  who  is  now  the  oldest  of  that  "  noble 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  67 

band"  who,  with  others,  sacrificed  all  for  their  principles,  their 
king  and  country— which  address  was  nobly  responded  to  by 
the  gallant  major.  From  thence  the  troops  proceeded  to  the 
Queen  square  where  a  salute  of  fifty  guns  was  fired  with  ad- 
mirable precision  by  the  artillery  companies — after  which  they 
proceeded  on  their  march  round  the  city— thence  to  King 
square,  where  a  royal  salute  was  fired  and  the  troops  dismissed, 
after  conducting  themselves  with  credit  to  their  commanders 
and  with  honor  to  the  day. 

Immediately  after  the  conclusion  of  the  above  ceremonies, 
by  invitation  of  the  venerable  gentleman  addressed,  the  officers 
of  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery  partook  of  a  very 
handsome  luncheon  at  his  residence. 

In  the  evening  a  splendid  ball  took  place  at  the  St.  John 
hotel,  where  all  the  pride,  beauty  and  loyalty  of  the  city  were 
assembled,  and  where  the  youth  of  both  sexes  amused  them- 
selves till  a  late  hour.  We  must  not  omit  to  mention  the 
brilliant  display  of  "  fireworks "  which  was  exhibited  to  the 
admiring  spectators  on  King's  square  during  the  evening,  and 
which  reflects  great  credit  on  the  projectors. 

The   following  is  a  copy    of   the    address    alluded    to    above 

with  Major  Ward's  reply : 

Saint  John,  May  i8th,  1843. 
Sir  :— 

Assembled  for  the  purpose  of  celebrating  the  Sixtieth  Anni- 
versary of  the  Landing  of  the  Loyalists  in  this  province,  and 
the  fiftieth  of  the  formation  of  the  first  (or  Loyal)  Company 
of  Artillery,  now  embodied  in  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment 
of  Artillery,  we,  the  officers  of  that  corps  in  St.  John,  gladly 
avail  ourselves  of  the  occasion  to  express  the  sentiments  of 
high  respect  entertained  towards  you  by  our  regiment  and  in 
which  we  feel  assured  every  member  of  this  community  par- 
ticipates. 

Deservedly  beloved  and  esteemed  as  you  have  ever  been  by 
all  round  you  throughout  the  course  of  a  life  already  extended 
beyond  the  ordinary  span  allotted  to  mortals,  we  claim  you 
with  pride  as  one  of  the  first  officers  of  the  corps  to  which  we 
have  now  the  honor  to  belong ;  and  we   hail  you  at  the  same

time  as  one  of  the  few  survivors  of  that  gallant  band,  who — 
surrendering  all  save  the  undying  honor  of  their  sacrifice — fol- 
lowed the  standard  of  their  Sovereign  to  these  shores,  and 
whose  landing  we  this  day  commemorate. 

That  health  and  prosperity  may  yet  long  be  yours,  and  h  at 
the  evening  of  your  days  may  be  as  free  from  a  cloud  as  your

To  Major  Nicholson  and  the   officers   at   St.  John    of  the  Neiv 
Brunszvick  Regiment  of  Artillery: 

Gentlemen — 

Your  address  revives  early  recollections  of  a  most  thrilling 
nature.  Nearly  seventy  years  now  have  passed  since  first  I  joined 
the  standard  of  my  country  as  a  British  soldier.  I  most  cheer- 
fully consented  to  every  sacrifice  to  maintain  the  rights  of  my 
Sovereign,  the  being  of  the  Constitution — and  when  it  pleased 
that  Sovereign  to  suspend  the  struggle,  I  yielded  to  the  event, 
retaining  my  allegiance- and  sixty  years  have  now  elapsed 
since  we  first  erected  the  standard  of  loyalty  in  this  place,  and 
the  corps  that  you  now  represent  was  soon  after  embodied, — 
a  corps  whose  high  character  for  efficiency  and  discipHne  is  so 


Major    John     Ward.

well  supported  by  your  present  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of 
Artillery. 

■  It  has  pleased  the  Almighty  to  prolong  my  days  beyond  the 
period  usually  allotted  to  man,  and  many  blessings  have  at- 
tended me,  and  mingled  with  the  greatest  is  the  esteem  of  my 
fellow  citizens,  and  this  additional  mark  of  your  regard  will  be 
fondly  cherished  by  me  during  the  few  short  hours  I  may  yet 
be  with  you. 

Gentlemen — I  thank  you  for  your  address  as  one  of  the  few 
surviving  Loyalists — as  .an  early  member  of  your  corps — and 
as  a  citizen  proud  of  your  esteem,  I  thank  you— accept  the 
blessings  of  an  old  man. 

Yours  affectionately, 
May  18.  John  Ward.

'The    ball    on    Thursday    evening,    given    by    the    St.  John 

*  division  of  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery,  was  far 

*  more  numerously  attended  than  any  during  the  season.  Over 
'  sixty  public  guests  were  invited  on  the  occasion,  a  large  num- 
'ber  of  whom,  including  Lieutenant-Colonel  Ormond,  Major 
'PoYNTZ,  and  the  officers  of  the  30th  and  52nd  Regiments; 
'  His  Worship  the  Mayor,  colonels  of  militia  and  heads  of

'  Henry  Anthony,  one  of  three  only  survivors  of  the  ninety- 
'  seven  good  and  loyal  men  who  fifty  years  ago  established  the

'  Captain  Charles  J.  Melick.' 

To  do  full  justice    to    the    memory    of    Major  John  Ward, 

whose  name  and  person  were  so  honored  by  our  predecessors 

of  half  a  century  ago,  would  require  a  volume  at  least  as  large

as  the  present,  and  might  profitably  be  written  if  the  regimen- 
tal history  permitted  of  biography  in  detail.  But  we  must 
content  ourselves  with  a  few  of  the  more  prominent  events  in 
his  remarkable  career.  Major  John  Ward  was  born  at  Peek- 
skill,  Westchester  County,  in  the  Province  of  New  York,  in 
1752.  His  family  were  all  loyal,  and  three  brothers  served 
the  crown  during  the  Revolutionary  war.  He  joined  the 
"  Loyal  American  Regiment,"  with  the  rank  of  ensign,  from 
which  he  was  promoted  to  a  lieutenancy  on  7  th  October, 
1777,  when  he  was  twenty  five  years  of  age.  He  served  with 
his  regiment  through  the  war,  being  frequently  in  action  and 
was  once  wounded.  He  had  a  friendly  intimacy  with  the  un- 
fortunate Major  Andre,  and  when  the  latter  started  up  the 
Hudson  in  the  Vulture  sloop  of  war,  on  his  ill-fated  mission 
to  General  Benedict  Arnold,  Lieutenant  Ward  was  in  com- 
mand of  the  escort  which  accompanied  him. 

At  the  peace  of  1783  he  came  to  Parrtown  with  the  rear 
guard  of  his  regiment  and  many  women  and  children.  No  ac- 
commodations had  been  provided  for  them  and  they  lived  in 
tents  thatohed  with  spruce  boughs,  erected  on  the  Barrack 
grounds.  Lower  Cove.  The  winter  was  rigorous  and  many 
women  and  children  died.  Lieutenant  Ward's  son,  John 
Ward,  jr.,  was  born  in  one  of  these  tents  on  the  i8th  Decem- 
ber,  1783. 

Lieutenant  Ward  removed  to  Sussex  Valley  in  the  spring  of 
1784,  but  only  remained  there  a  short  time,  as  in  1785  he 
entered  into  business  in  St.  John  with  his  brothers  Benjamin 
and  Moses.  This  firm  was  the  pioneer  in  the  West  India 
business,  which  brought  so  much  prosperity  to  St  John  in  tHe 
early  days.  The  subject  of  our  sketch  was  a  man  of  more 
tha!i    ordinary    enterprise.      In    company    with    the    late    Hon.

Hugh  Johnston,  he  put   the   first  steamboat  on  the  St.  John 

river.     It  was  called  the    General  Smythe,  and  made  the  first 

trip  to  Fredericton  on  May  loth,   1816.      The  General  Smythe 

was  followed   by    the    St.  George,  John  Ward  and    Fredericton. 

Naturally  he  took  much  interest   in   military   matters  and  until 

his  resignation  in   18 16    was    for    many   years  in  the  command 

of  the  militia  of  the  city  and  county  of  Saint  John.     In  1809, 

i8i6  and  18 19  he  represented  the  county  of  Saint  John  in  the 

House  of  Assembly.     His  name,  for  many  years,  stood  first  in 

the  commission  of  the  Peace  for  the  city  and  county,  until  on  5th 

November,  1846,  he  died  at  his  residence,  corner  of  King  and 

Germain  streets,  in  the  94th  year  of  his  age.     The  following  is 

an  extract  from  the  obituary  notice  which  appeared  in  the  St. 

John  "  Courier  "   upon  his  demise  : — 

"Thus  full  of  years  and  honors  has  departed  one  who  has 
led  an  unblemished  life,  and  who  carries  with  him  to  the 
grave  the  highest  esteem  and  most  profound  respect  of  the 
community  to  whom  his  noble  and  venerable  appearance,  his 
strict  integrity  and  amiable  disposition  have  long  been  familiar." 

So  with  the  life  story  of  a  good  and  noble  man  whose  youh 

was  brilliant  with  courage  and  whose  multitude  of  years  taught 

wisdom,  closes  the    first    half   century    of   the    corps   of  which 

he  was  a   founder   and  which  venerates  his    memory   today  as 

that  of  a  hero  and  a  patriarch.

becomes  Adjutant- General^Debate  on  Militia  Law — Its  Former 
Provisions — Uniform  Companies — Beginning  of  Be-organization. 


HIS  was  an  era  of  profound  peace,  and  for  years  it  seemed 
unnecessary  to  many  persons  that  militia  training  should 
be  kept  up.  But  despite  the  lack  of  encouragement 
from  the  government,  which  year  by  year  withdrew  its  support 
from  the  militia  system,  and  despite  the  growing  indifference 
of  the  people  to  its  welfare,  the  regiment  kept  its  ranks  fairly 
well  recruited.  It  is  true  that  the  artillery  did  not  drill  many 
days  in  each  year,  but  it  is  equally  true  that  whenever  their 
services  were  required  for  the  celebration  of  an  anniver- 
sary, especially  that  of  their  Loyalist  forefathers,  they  were 
ready  and  willing  to  respond.  That  the  corps  of  which  we 
are  so  proud  has  a  century  of  history  to  which  we  can  point 
to-day,  is  the  best  possible  tribute  to  that  officer  by  whose 
exertions  it  was  kept  alive.  To  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  is 
due  the  credit  of  having  by  his  personal  influence  and  example, 
at  a  time  when  regiment  after  regiment  of  militia  was  dying 
out,  maintained  in  some  efficiency  a  portion  of  the  old  regiment, 
sufficiently  strong  to  preserve  the  organizations  of  1793  and 
1838  until  they  were  placed  upon  a  firmer  basis  in  i860. 
The  reader  must  expect  but  little  from  these  days,  and  be 
surprised  rather  because  there  is  a  record  at  all,  than  at  the 
nioagreness  of  the  one  which  is  presented.^

On  5th  July,  1844,  Captain  John  C.  Allen  was  appointed 
a  provincial  aid-de-camp.  In  these  times  the  Fredericton-  com- 
pany always  fired  a  salute  at  the  opening  and  closing  of  the 
legislature,  and  in  dealing  with  this  period  it  is  to  be  particu- 
larly remembered  that  during  the  whole  of  it,  and  for  years 
afterwards,  a  company  was  available  for  this  purpose.  In  Septem- 
ber of  the  following  year  Colonel  Hayne  left  Fredericton  en 
route  to  England  whither  he  was  called  on  business  connected 
with  the  Nova  Scotia  and  New  Brunswick  Land  Company. 
On  the  same  morning  (29th  September)  Captain  Poulden's 
detachment  of  the  Royal  Artillery  also  left  Fredericton  and 
Captain  Berton's  company  of  the  N.  B.  Regiment  turned  out 
and  gave  them  a  farewell  salute. 

In  1846  there  was  quite  a  number  of  promotions  and  appoint- 
ments. Among  them  was  that  of  Robert  Reed,  of  St.  John, 
who  became  second  lieutenant  in  the  Nicholson  company, 
then  under  command  of  Captain  William  Hughson.  Mr.  Reed 
had  been  in  the  corps  for  many  years  and  up  to  his  death  had 
a  vivid  recollection  of  the  old  days.  He  recalled  the  times  in 
the  early  '40's  when  the  companies  used  to  cross  over  to  the 
Carleton  shore  in  scows  and  go  down  to  the  Manawagonish 
road  for  their  training.  In  1839,  as  before  stated,  he  was  on 
garrison  duty  in  St.  John  during  the  Aroostook  war.  At  this 
time  the  artillery  had  two  light  6-pr.  guns.  They  drilled  in 
the  open  air,  generally  about  King  square,  which  was  then  a 
common  of  very  uninviting  appearance.  This  drill  would 
continue  for  three  days  after  which  the  muster  took  place  on 
the  sands  at  Courtenay  Bay.  The  selection  of  the  day  for  the 
muster  was  always  governed  by  the  tide,  it  being  arranged  that 
the  militia  should  leave  King  square  about  the  time  that  the 
tide  began  to  ebb.     When   the    soldiery   reached   their   parade

HISTORICAL    RFXORDS    OF    THE 


the  flats  were  quite  dry  and  in  beautiful  condition  for  march- 
ing. .Training  day  was  in  the  nature  of  a  fete  to  the  people 
of  the  little  city.  The  country  people  drove  in  and  the  city 
people  drove  out.  Booths  were  erected  and  a  thriving  business 
done  in  all  kinds  of  refreshments.  Old  women  with  shrivelled 
faces  set  up  their  apple  stands,  old  men  whose  days  of  train- 
ing were  long  past  extolled  the  attractions  of  their  wares  in 
quavering  voices.  Boys  rushed  about  pell-mell,  and  tumbled 
over  everybody  in  their  anxiety  to  get  the  best  possible  view 
of  all  that  was  going  on.  Wives,  sisters,  mothers  and  sweet- 
hearts, sought  the  sandy  slopes  beyond  the  Marsh,  each  be- 
lieving that '  her  representative  in  the  ranks  was  the  finest 
soldier  of  them  all.  They  were  merry,  merry  days,  and  we 
cannot  but  feel  a  touch  of  sadness  when  the  old  men  of  to- 
day relate  these  bright  experiences  of  their  boyhood.  The  sun 
seems  to  have  shone  more  brightly,  the  grass  was  greener,  the 
waters  were  more  careless,  and  the  world  was  happier  in  those 
days  of  old  than  it  is  in  this  more  progressive  but  sterner  age 
of  terrible  reality. 

There  were  no  World's  Fairs  then,  but  when  the  stock  of 
provisions  had  been  consumed,  the  bugles  had  sounded  and 
the  boys  in  blue  and  scarlet  were  marching  home  again,  the 
stimulus  of  liquid  refreshment  raised  many  a  volunteer  and 
many  a  spectator  to  the  summit  of  human  bliss.  There  were 
no  more  worlds  to  conquer,  and  when  the  crowd  returned  to 
the  city  which  had  been  unguarded  in  their  absence,  a  night 
of  jollification  ensued.     Such  were  the  Muster  Days. 

The  annual  inspection  of  1846  was  held  on  20th  May.  In 
the  next  year  Captain  Thomas  B.  Wilson  was  appointed 
provincial  aid-de-camp.  On  the  laying  of  the  corner  stone  of 
the   Provincial   Lunatic  Asylum   at  St.  John,  in   1847,  ^  salute 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  75 

was  fired  by  a  company  of  artillery  under  Major  Nicholson. 
In  1848  Colonel  Hayne  became  assistant  adjutant-general  in 
the  place  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  W.  H.  Robinson,  who  had  died 
shortly  before.  The  death  of  Major  Thomas  L.  Nicholson 
occurred  in  this  year,  and  the  vacancy  thus  caused  was  filled 
by  the  promotion  of  Captain  S.  K.  Foster  to  the  majority. 
Mr.  G.  Sidney  Smith,  of  St.  John,  remembers  the  funeral  of 
Major  Nicholson,  at  which  he  says  the  artillery  was  present 
under  Captains  Foster,  Melick,  Wright  and  Stewart. 

The  "Courier"  of  19th  May,  1849,  contains  the  following 
account  of  the  celebration  of  the  sixty-sixth  anniversary  of  the 
landing  of  the  Loyalists,  which  had  been  observed  on  the  pre- 
vious day  : — 

"The  anniversary  of  the  landing  of  the  Loyalists  in  this 
city  in  1783  was  celebrated  yesterday.  Flags  were  to  be  seen 
floating  from  the  dwellings  of  many  of  the  descendants  of  the 
loyalists  and  from  other  conspicuous  situations,  and  some  of 
the  vessels  in  the  harbor  were  bedecked  with  their  colors. 
The  St.  John  companies  of  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of 
Artillery  fired  a  royal  salute  at  noon  and  marched  through  the 
streets  preceded  by  one  of  the  amateur  bands  playing  some 
lively  airs.  In  the  evening  Queen's  square  and  its  environs 
were  crowded  by  a  dense  mass  of  people  to  witness  a  display 
of  fireworks.  The  exhibition  exceeded  anything  of  the  kind 
ever  seen  here,  and  was  grand  and  beautiful  in  the  extreme, 
and  reflected  great  credit  upon  all  concerned  in  getting  it  up. 
The  committee  of  management  were  Major  S.  K.  Foster,  of 
the  Artillery ;  Captain  T.  E.  G.  Tisdale,  City  Rifles,  and  Mr. 
John  Sears,  all  descendants  of  the  first  settlers  of  St.  John." 

The  annual  muster  of  this  year  was  held  on  the  9th  Octo- 
ber. The  1 8th  of  May  of  the  next  year  was  observed  by  the 
firing  of  a  salute  and  a  display  of  fire  works  on  the  Queen's 
square  similar  to  that  of  the  previous  year. 

There  were  several  promotions    in    1849,    among  them   that 


76  HISTORICAL   RECORDS    OF    THE 

of  Lieutenant  Fred  A.  Wiggins  to  be  paymaster  vice  Boyd, 
resigned.  Much  dissatisfaction  was  afterwards  caused  by  tlie 
granting  of  "rank  to  this  officer,  which,  it  was  claimed,  was 
unjust  to  those  who  had  done  more  work  than  he.  The  mat- 
ter was  adjusted,  but  not  until  the  interest  of  several  officers 
in  the  regiment  was  destroyed. 

In  185 1  Colonel  Hayne  became  adjutant-general  of  the 
province  upon  the  death  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  the  Honorable 
George  Shore,  which  occurred  on  i8th  May.  Though 
not  an  officer  of  our  regiment,  yet  the  record  of  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Shore  is  so  thoroughly  identified  with  the  militia 
system  of  New  Brunswick  that  a  slight  digression  may  be 
pardoned,  in  extracting  from  the  "  Courier "  of  May  24th  of 
that  year  the  notice  of  his  death.     It  is  as  follows  : 

"On  the  afternoon  of  Sunday  last  Lieutenant-Colonel  the 
Hon.  George  Shore  expired  at  his  residence  in  this  city 
(Fredericton)  after  an  illness  of  three  days  duration.  Colonel 
Shore  came  to  this  province  in  1804 — -was  an  officer  in  the 
104th  Regiment,  and  marched  at  the  head  of  the  light  com- 
pany of  that  corps  to  Canada  in  18 13,  where  he  served  dur- 
ing the  continuance  of  the  last  American  war.  After  returning 
from  Canada,  Colonel  Shore  was  appointed  A.  D.  C.  and 
private  secretary  to  the  late  General  Smythe,  then  governor  of 
the  province,  and  subsequently,  at  different  periods,  filled  the 
offices  of  auditor-general  and  surveyor-general. 

In  1825  Colonel  Shore  was  permanently  appointed  to  the 
office  of  clerk  of  the  pleas  in  the  Supreme  Court,  which  office 
he  continued  to  hold  up  to  the  time  of  his  death.  The  de- 
ceased was  also  at  one  time  inspecting  officer  of  militia,  and 
was  afterwards  appointed  adjutant-general,  which  office  he  held 
at  the  time  of  his  decease.  Besides  filling  in  turn,  with  credit 
to  himself  and  satisfaction  to  the  country,  the  offices  which 
we  have  already  enumerated,  the  deceased  was  more  than  once 
an  executive  adviser  of  the  crown,  and  for  many  years  had  a 
scat  in  the  legislative  council  of  the  province."     -x-      -x-      -x-      *

The  funeral  of  Colonel  Shore  was  strictly  private. 

The- 29th  September,  1852,  was  an  eventful  day  in  the  his- 
tory of  New  Brunswick,  being  the  occasion  of  the  signing  of 
the  contract  for  the  building  of  the  line  of  railway  from  St. 
John  to  Amherst,  and  also  from  St.  John  to  the  American 
frontier.  The  contract  was  signed  at  St.  John  at  12  o'clock, 
noon,  of  that  day,  and  the  volunteer  artillery,  under  command 
of  Major  Foster,  fired  a  salute  from  Chipman's  Hill. 

There  was  a  somewhat  acrimonious  debate  over  the  intro- 
duction of  a  new  militia  bill  in  the  House  of  Assembly  on  the 
24th  March,  1853.  Though  the  bill  was  offered  in  compliance 
with  royal  instructions,  yet  it  was  ridiculed  by  some  of  the 
members,  and  apparently  misunderstood.  The  House  had  no 
sympathy  with  a  militia  system.  But  one  branch  of  that  sys- 
tem had  still  some  life  in  it,  for  we  find  that  the  i8th  of 
May  of  that  year,  being  the  seventieth  anniversary  of  the 
landing  of  the  loyalists,  was  observed  in  the  usual  manner  by 
a  salute  from  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery.  On 
the  14th  September  there  was  a  great  demonstration  in  the 
city  of  Saint  John  in  honor  of  the  turning  of  the  sod  of  the 
European  and  North  American  Railway,  for  the  building  of 
which  the  contract  had  been  signed  in  the  previous  year.  The 
day  was  ushered  in  by  a  salute  from  the  artillery,  and  at  ten 
o'clock  the  streets  were  crowded  by  a  throng  of  people.  Half 
an  hour  later  one  of  the  great  old  time  trades  processions  be- 
gan to  move  through  the  city.  First  came  a  body  of  citizens 
on  horseback,  then  a  company  of  the  New  Brunswick  Artillery; 
the  marshals ;  the  president  and  directors  of  the  Mechanics' 
Institute ;  the  trades  ;  Common  Council ;  fire  companies ;  jus- 
tices of  the  peace ;  millmen ;  men  of  the  Black  Ball  Line  of 
Liverpool  Packets ;   pilots ;   Freemasons    and   many    others  ;  in 


78  HISTORICAL    RPXORDS    OF    THE 

all  upwards  of  5,000  persons.      The    procession    was    nearly    a 
mile  in  length. 

The  artillery  fired  a  salute  when  the  first  sod  was  raised  by 
Lady  Head,  wife  of  the  Lieutenant-Governor,  and  deposited  in 
an  elegant  wheelbarrow. 

At  this,  the  transition  period  from  the  old  to  the  new  sys- 
tems of  organization  of  the  militia,  it  may  be  well  to  briefly 
review  the  provisions  of  the  militia  laws  of  the  time.  Refer- 
ence has  previously  been  made  to  the  law  in  force  at  the 
time  of  the  formation  of  the  Colville  company,  which,  how- 
ever, was  changed  from  time  to  time.  There  seemed  for  many 
years  to  be  a  feeling  against  having  a  permanent  militia  law 
on  the  principle  which  has  always  been  urged  against  standing 
armies.  Whether  or  not  that  was  the  true  reason,  it  is  a  fact 
that  the  law  was  frequently  enacted,  the  provisions  of  the  acts 
varying  but  very  little.  At  length,  in  1825,  acts  relating  to 
the  militia  were  consolidated.  All  male  residents  of  the  pro- 
vince from  sixteen  to  sixty  years  of  age  were  rendered  liable 
to  militia  service  in  battalions  to  be  formed  in  each  county 
Where  the  counties  were  sufficiently  populous  more  than  one 
battalion  might  be  formed.  The  company  was  the  unit,  and 
each  was  to  consist  of  not  more  than  sixty  rank  and  file  under 
one  captain  and  two  subalterns.  The  exemptions  were  mem- 
bers of  the  .Legislative  Council  and  House  of  Assembly, 
established  clergymen,  licensed  ministers  of  the  gospel,  all 
persons  exercising  civil  or  military  commissions  under  the 
crown  ;  officers  ^n  half  pay,  supernumerary  militia  officers  then 
in  -commission ;  officers  of  customs,  revenue  and  naval  officers; 
physicians  and  surgeons,  licensed  to  practice  as  such ;  one 
miller  to  each  grist  mill,  and  one  ferryman  to  each  established 
fcMry,  and  Quakers  who  had  been  members  of  that  sect  for  one 


N.    v..    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  79 

year.  Nearly  all  of  these  exempts  were  liable  to  service  in 
case  of  actual  invasion.  Provision  was  made  for  drilling 
regiments  or  battalions  one  day  in  each  year,  and  battalions 
were  to  be  drilled  by  companies  twice  during  that  period. 
To  assist  in  the  administration  adjutants  and  sergeant-majors 
of  battalions  received  a  small  money  grant  annually.  Exempts, 
except  ferrymen,  had  to  pay  a  tax  of  ten  shillings  per  year, 
and  there  was  also  a  license  upon  aliens.  When  drafts  for 
actual  service  were  made  they  were  confined  to  persons  be- 
tween eighteen  and  fifty  years  of  age  and  volunteers  were  to 
be  accepted  without  draft.  The  commander-in-chief  was  given 
power  to  establish  artillery  and  sea  fencible  companies,  and  to 
direct  the  mode  of  drilling  them.  In  cases  of  emergency 
which  might  render  the  services  of  the  artillery  more  necessary 
than  others,  the  officer  commanding  any  regiment  or  battalion 
in  which  there  might  be  an  artillery  company  was  authorized 
to  call  out  the  whole  or  part  of  such  ccmpany  though  the 
number  so  called  out  might  exceed  the  proportion  of  men 
which    the    company  was   liable   to  furnish. 

As  stated  before  the  Artillery  company  at  St.  John  was  al- 
ways uniformed.  In  1827  an  act  was  passed  for  the  encourage- 
ment of  this  and  other  uniform  companies.  In  after  years 
membership  in  these  companies  became  quite  a  privilege  as 
they  kept  up  regular  drill  and  the  members  were  fairly  well 
instructed.  All  who  did  not  join  the  companies  were  called 
out  for  one  or  two  days  drill  each  year,  and  from  their  ignor- 
ance of  squad  drill  were  termed  the  '  flat  feet.'  Those  belonging 
to  uniform  companies  acted  as  instructors  of  the  others  and 
always  had  much  fun  with  the  amusing  blunders  of  the  raw 
recruits. 

In   1839  provision  was 'made  for  the  establishment  of  battal- 


^O  HiSTORiCAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

ions  of  Artillery   and    Sea    Fencibles^  but    in    the    case    of   the 
Artillery  a  regiment  had  been  formed  in  the  previous  year. 

In  1 85 1  owing  to  great  opposition  on  the  part  of  the  people 
who  were  drilled  as  'flat  feet'  many  provisions  of  the  militia 
law  were  suspended  for  that  year.  When  the  statutes  were  re^ 
vised  in  1854  the  whole  militia  law  was  consolidated  without 
alteration,  and  the  sections  of  the  old  acts  which  had  been  sus- 
pended were  further  suspended  until  1856,  it  being  provided 
that  the  Commander-in-Chief  might  by  proclamation  revive 
these  sections  or  any  portion  of  them.  The  suspended  portions 
of  the  law,  however,  applied  only  to  that  branch  of  the  militia 
which  is  now  designated  as  the  'Reserve.'  Chapter  82  of  the 
Revised  Statutes  which  dealt  exclusively  with  the  Artillery  and 
Sea  Fencible  companies  was  not  suspended,  and  the  keeping 
of  a  militia  force  was  always  sanctioned.  The  portions  of  the 
acts  suspended  dealt  with  the  imposition  of  penalties  for  non- 
attendance  at  drill  and  similar  vindicatory  provisions  of  the 
law.  That  this  construction  of  the  law  is  correct  is  amply 
proved  by  the  act  of  the  Lieutenant-Governor,  Hon.  J.  H.  T. 
Manners  Sutton,  who,  in  1859,  without  issuing  a  proclama- 
tion accepted  the  services  of  several  volunteer  companies. 
During  the  period  of  suspension  some  commissions  were  issued 
and  among  them  one  dated  i8th  April,  1855,  to  Sergeant- 
Major  Thomas  Paisley  as  second  lieutenant  in  the.  Artillery 
company  at  Fredericton.  As  before  stated  the  Fredericton 
company  always  fired  a  salute  at  the  opening  and  closing  of 
the  legislative  session.  Of  course,  it  is  not  pretended  for  one 
moment  that  there  was  a  thoroughly  organized  and  well  disci- 
plined body  of  men  continuously  existing  as  the  New  Bruns- 
wick Regiment  of  Artillery,  but  what  can  be  successfully  proved 
is,  that  one  or  more  companies   had   an    existence  during  this 


N.    B     GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  8 1 

period  of  inactivity;  that  on  many  public  occasions  they  assisted 
in  their  capacity  of  an  artillery  force,  and  that,  when  vigorous  re- 
cruiting began  again  in  1859,  some  of  the  old  officers  retained 
command  of  their  companies  while  the  appointment  of  new 
officers  was,  in  many  cases,,  recognized  in  general  orders  as 
being  in  substitution  for  others  who  retired. 

One  of  the  last  incidents  in  which  the  St.  John  Artillery 
took  part,  during  the  period  with  which  this  chapter  deals,  was 
the  celebration  on  September  ist^  1858,  consequent  on  the 
successful  laying  of  the  Atlantic  cable. 

After  the  Crimean  war  there  was  a  very  enthusiastic  volun- 
teer movement  in  England  which  has  continued  with  increasing 
strength  to  the  present  time,  resulting  in  one  of  the  finest  forces 
of  modern  times.  The  inception  of  the  system  seems  to  have 
attracted  the  attention  of  Major-General  Sir  Fenwick  Williams, 
who,  on  leaving  England  in  1859  to  assume  command  of  the 
forces  in  the  North  American  provinces,  suggested  a  scheme 
of  defence  for  the  colonies  based  on  similar  principles.  The 
Duke  of  New^castle,  then  Colonial  Secretary,  wrote  to  the 
Lieutenant-Governor  of  New  Brunswick  expressing  a  desire  that 
he  might  confer  with  General  Williams  whose  views  had  the 
sanction  and  concurrence  of  the  home-  government.  In  con- 
sequence of  this  request  it  was  intimated  that  the  services 
would  be  accepted  of  such  companies  as  might  volunteer,  and 
in  the  summer  of  1859  the  work  of  instructing  the  militia  was 
recommended,  and  has  been  continued  to  the  present  time.

TN  his  despatch  to  the  Duke  of  Newcastle,  dated  9th  Decem. 
X  her,  1859,  Lieutenant-Governor  Manners-Sutton  stated 
that  the  revival  of  the  mihtia  acts  by  proclamation  would 
have  necessitated  the  calling  out  of  the  whole  able-bodied 
population  of  the  province,  which  would  be  an  unnecessary 
interference  with  industry.  No  such  objection  could  be  urged 
against  his  acceptance  of  the  spontaneous  offer  of  any  portion 
of  the  several  regiments  of  militia  to  volunteer  in  companies 
for  drill  and  exercise,  under  command  of  the  officers  of  their 
respective  regiments.  He  had  applied  for  and  received  from 
Lieutenant-Governor  Sir  Fenwick  Williams,  in  command  at 
Quebec,  three  thousand  stand  of  rifles  with  accoutrements, 
which  were  stored  at  St.  John.  In  that  city  four  companies 
of  the  artillery  had  volunteered ;  their  services  had  been  ac- 
cepted, and  they  would  be  instructed  in  rifle  practice  and  drill. 
Adjutant-General  Hayne's  report,  dated  12th  January,  i860, 
a  copy  of  which  was  also  transmitted,  showed  the  state  of  the 
artillery  to  be  as  follows  :

The  companies  in  St.  John  and  Fredericton  were  then  being 
drilled  by  their  own  officers  and  non-connmissioned  officers.  A 
subsequent  report  of  loth  March  showed  that  the  company 
was  still  being  formed  at  Fredericton  ;  that  five  companies  con- 
sisting of  two  hundred  and  eighty  men  had  been  enrolled  at 
St.  John  and  that  another  company  was  in  process  of  formation, 
while  one  of  thirty-eight  men  had  been  enrolled  at  Woodstock. 
Two  light  guns  at  St.  John  and  two  at  Woodstock  were  in 
use,  and  the  artillery  were  also  being  drilled  with  rifles. 

When  active  work  ceased  Colonel  Hayne  was  in  command 
of  the  regiment ;  S.  K.  Foster,  major ;  John  C.  Allen,  ad-

It  is  difficult  to  place  any  other  officers  with  accuracy,  but 
an  attempt  has  been  made  to  do  so  in  the  appendix  to  this 
work. 

The  active  work  of  re-organization  in  St.  John  was  done  by 
James  Mount,  who  had  been  a  sergeant  in  a  company  of  the 
Royal  Artillery.  He  was  appointed  captain  in  the  militia 
artillery  about  June,  1859,  and  set  to  work  enrolling  a  volun- 
teer company.  Success  attended  his  efforts,  and  in  a  few 
weeks  the  roll  was  signed  by  one  hundred  and  twenty  of  the 
brightest  and  most  active  young  men  of  the  city.  The  first 
name  was  that  of  George  H.  Pick,  whose  connection  with 
the  artillery  will  be  many  times  referred  to  in  these  pages. 

Militia  general  orders  of  20th  September,  1859,  contain  the 
appointment  of  Captain  Mount  to  the  adjutancy  vice  John  C. 
Allen,  who  resigned  that  office  only  and  retained  his  rank  of 
captain  in  the  regiment.  On  the  14th  November  George  H. 
Pick,  Robert  Sneden  and  George  Thomas  were  gazetted 
lieutenants.  These  were  officers  of  Mount's  company,  which 
was  afterwards  designated  as  'No.  i.'  On  an  evening  in  the 
summer  of  1859  the  company  met  in  an  old  building  on  the 
corner  of  Duke  and  Prince  WiUiam  streets,  St.  John,  after- 
wards used  as  a  dance  hall  and  bowling  alley,  and  elected 
officers,  a  proceeding  which  would  seem  strange  in  these  days. 
Besides  the  lieutenants  just  mentioned,  Frank  Lansdowne 
and  James  F.  Robertson  were  chosen  sergeants.  The  latter 
is    now  a  member   of   the    well-known    firm    of   Manchester, 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  85 

Robertson  &amp;  Allison.  On  December  6th  of  that  year  Major 
Foster  attained  the  rank  of  brevet  lieutenant-colonel,  and 
Captain  Charles  J.  Melick,  of  the  old  Colville  company  was 
gazetted  major  vice  Hon.  G.  F.  Street,  deceased,  thus  filling 
up  the  regimental  establishment  of  two  majors.  The  Ranney 
company  was  also  filled  up  by  the  promotion  of  Lieutenant 
John  R.  Marshall  to  the  captaincy  and  the  appointment  of 
George  F.  Thompson,  Robert  J.  Leonard  and  Francis 
Smith  as  lieutenants.  On  the  same  day  a  new  company  was 
accepted  with  Josiah  Adams,  captain,  Joseph  Coram,  Edwin 
J.  Wetmore  and  George  J,  Stackhouse,  lieutenants,  which 
was  subsequently  designated  as  '  No.  2,'  and  is  now  the  Carle- 
ton  company.  They  drilled  in  the  upper  rooms  of  a  store  on 
South  Rodney  wharf  and  exercised  on  the  wharf  with  their 
guns.  The  superintendent  of  ferries  of  St.  John,  Mr.  H. 
Adam  Glasgow,  was  one  of  the  first  sergeants  of  the  company. 
In  January,  i860,  Lieutenant  Pick  became  captain  of  No.  i 
and  Francis  Lansdowne  succeeded  to  a  lieutenancy,  while  in 
Portland  Hurd  Peters  as  captain,  with  Alexaa^der  Rankin 
and  James  Kirk,  raised  a  new  company  which  is  still  in 
existence  as  'No.  3.'  They  organized  in  the  fire  engine  house  on 
Simonds  street,  and  from  thence  removed  to  the  Madras  school 
building  where  St.  Peter's  church  now  stands.  The  company 
afterwards  occupied  the  Portland  temperance  hall.  They  had 
two  3-pr.  guns  from  the  barracks  and  were  supplied  with 
Enfield  Snider  rifles.  Another  company  was  also  formed  in 
Portland  under  Captain  Richard  Simonds  and  Lieutenant  W. 
Rogers,  principally  from  the  men  of  Protector  No.  2  Engine 
Company.  They  drilled  for  some  time,  but  eventually  most 
of  the  members  went  into  one  of  the  infantry  companies  then 
being  raised,  and    Captain  Simonds'    company  ceased  to  exist. 


S6  HJSTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

In  the  same  month  Lewis  Durant  of  the  Colville  company 
became  its  captain  ;  second  Heutenant  James  G.  Melick  was 
promoted  to  the  first  Heutenancy  and  Thomas  Coke  Humbert 
was  also  gazetted  as  Heutenant.  In  February  the  Woodstock 
company,  known  as  No.  5,  was  re-organized  with  James  Edgar, 
captain  ;  William  Skillen  and  Edward  D.  Watts  heutenants. 
Another  company,  afterwards  known  as  No.  7,  at  Chatham, 
Northumberland  County,  was  organized  in  March  with  James 
C.  E.  Carmichael,  captain,  Elijah  Parsons  and  Thomas  F. 
Gillespie,  Heutenants ;  while  at  Gagetown  J.  Warren  Travis, 
captain,  Fred,  Lundrine  Knox  and  William  J.  Frost,  lieu- 
tenants, added  another  to  the  roll. 

Yet  another  company  was  formed  in  the  next  month  of  this 
year.  It  was  a  second  company  in  Carleton,  St.  John,  with 
John  McLauchlan,  captain,  Richard  Newell  Knight  and 
Thomas  Mitchell  McLachlan,  lieutenants.  The  numbers  by 
which  these  companies  are  referred  to  were  not  given  at  the 
time  of  formation  and  do  not  appear  in  any  official  list  In 
fact  the  question  of  priority  was  one  of  considerable  doubt  and 
may  in  some  sense  be  even  yet  considered  an  open  question. 
As  stated  previously,  the  commissions  of  all  the  regimental  and 
many  of  the  company  officers  remained  in  force  though  active 
work  had  not  been  carried  on  for  a  few  years.  In  Fredericton 
a  company  always  fired  a  salute  at  the  opening  and  closing  of 
the  legislature  and  in  St.  John  any  public  celebration  was  gen- 
erally accompanied  by  a  salute.  Yet  the  Colville  company 
was  not  in  a  position  to  take  up  drill  without  recruiting  and 
it  does  not  appear  that  Captain  Charles  J.  Melick  made  any 
active  effort  to  begin  the  work.  His  accession  to  the  majority 
afforded  an  opportunity  for  younger  blood  to  make  the  neces- 
sary effort  but  time  was  thereby  lost,  and  Captain  Pick's  com- 


N.    B.    GARRISON*\RTILLERV.  87 

pany  was  undoubtedly  in  an  efficient  state  before  any  other. 
But  even  then  the  claim  was  made  by  Captain  Durant  and 
his  successor,  Captain  James  G.  Melick,  that  they  were  the 
heirs  of  the  Colville  company,  and  though  the  authorities  at 
a  subsequent  time  chose  to  designate  Captain  Pick's  company 
as  No.  I  and  that  of  Captain  Durant  as  No.  3,  their  decision 
does  not  appear  to  have  been  based  upon  historical  claims 
but  rather  upon  the  order  in  which  the  rolls  were  forwarded. 
It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  numbering  is  not  used  in  any  official 
reports.  The  result  of  a  great  deal  of  investigation  given  to 
this  subject  shows  that  the  Durant  company  was  beyond  doubt 
the   lineal   successor  of  the  Colville  company. 

The  guns  of  the  St.  John  artillery  at  this  time  were  3-prs. 
and  were  kept  in  a  barn  on  King  street  east  about  opposite  to 
the  gymnasium.  They  were  under  the  charge  of  Major  Melick. 
The  use  of  these  guns  by  the  older  organizations  is  recalled 
by  John  R.  Marshall,  still  living,  who  from  1862  to  1890 
was  chief  of  the  St.  John  police  force.  About  1830  he  joined 
Captain  Barlow's  company  when  George  Waterbury,  Rob- 
ert Robertson  and  Charles  J.  Melick  were  lieutenants,  and 
rose  through  the  ranks  of  bombardier,  corporal  and  sergeant 
to  a  lieutenantcy  in  1848.  When  he  joined  the  company 
James  G.  Melick  and  Lewis  Durant  were  sergeants.  Drill 
was  carried  on  in  the  old  fire  engine  house  then  on  Dock 
street,  and  the  two  3-pr.  guns  w^ere  kept  in  the  battery  at 
Lower  Cove.  On  his  appointment  to  a  lieutenantcy  he  was 
transferred  to  Wright's  company  of  which,  as  we  have  seen, 
he  afterwards  became  captain.  They  drilled  principally  on  the 
King  square  and  afterwards  in  the  Mechanics'  Institute,  and 
had  sixty  stand  of  r-ifles  which  were  kept  in  Captain  Marshall's 
house,  in  rear  of  St.  John's  (Stone)  Church.     In  1862  the  rifles 


SS  HISTORICAL  'RECORDS    OF    THE 

were  sent  away  and  the  company  did  not  re-enrol  under  the 
new  militia  act  of  that  year.  Captain  Marshall  took  part  in 
the  coronation  salute  of  one  hundred  guns  in  1838,  which  was 
fired  from  King  square. 

A  meeting  of  the  officers  of  the  regiment  was  held  on  the 
evening  of  the  26th  April,  i860,  at  No.  3  Engine  house,  Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Foster  in  the  chair,  at  which  the  question  of 
uniform  was  discussed.  That  originally  agreed  upon  for  officers 
and  men  was  the  shell  jacket  and  trousers  similar  to  the 
undress  of  the  Royal  Artillery,  but  some  of  the  officers  were 
opposed  to  this,  contending  that  for  the  officers,  at  least,  the 
uniform  should  be  a  tunic  or  frock  coat.  After  a  long  dis- 
cussion the  first  idea  prevailed,  and  the  dress  chosen  was  a 
dark  blue  jacket  trimmed  red ;  trousers  with  red  stripe  down 
the  side ;  forage  cap  with  red  band  for  privates  and  non-com- 
missioned officers,  and  a  gold  band  for  officers.  It  was  voted 
that  the  regiment  should  fire  salutes  on  the  i8th  and  24th  ot 
May  of  that  year  should  they  be  then  in  possession  of  their 
guns.  The  boys  must  have  got  their  guns  in  time,  for  the 
salutes  were  duly  fired,  and  a  newspaper  item  states  that  there 
was  a  muster  of  one  of  the  companies  on  the  24th,  the  mem- 
bers of  which  looked  very  well  in  their   new  uniforms.

shall's company,  on  the  subject  of  uniforms  are  quite  in- 
teresting. He  purchased  his  uniform  cap,  shell  jacket  and 
gold  laced  trousers  for  ^25  from  McKenzie,  the  King  street 
tailor,  who  was  afterwards  cruelly  murdered  in  the  Little  River 
tragedy.  His  sword  and  belts  cost  him  ^15  more.  The 
uniform  previously  worn,  said  Mr.  Thompson,  consisted  of  a 
jacket  with  two  short  tails.  Underneath  the  jacket  there  was 
a    book    with    a  curve    slightly    protruding    to    hold    the    belts,

which  were  two  inches  wide.  The  sea  fencibles  used  artillery 
guns.  Their  uniform  was  a  blue  cloth  round-about  jacket  with 
wliite  duck  trousers  and  a  glazed  cap.  The  rank  of  officers 
in  those  days  was  distinguished  by  epaulets,  the  lieutenants 
wearing  one  and  captains  two. 

One  or  two  items  gleaned  from  the  newspapers  of  the  day 
must  bring  this  chapter  to  a  close: 

"On  the  evening  of  May  31st  several  companies  of  the 
New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery  belonging  to  the  city 
and  Portland  were  inspected  on  the  Barrack  Square  by  Major- 
General  Trollope.  The  companies  were  drawn  up  in  line  by 
Captain  and  Adjutant  Mount.  The  lieutenant-colonel  com- 
manding the  district  placed  himself  in  front,  and  on  the  arrival 
of  the  general  and  his  suite,  received  him  with  the  customary 
honors.  The  general,  after  reviewing  the  companies,  addressed 
the  colonel,  officers  and  men  in  a  pleasant  and  appropriate 
manner,  concluding  with  the  hope  that  on  the  arrival  of  the 
Prince  of  Wales  the  part  which  the  artillery  should  bear  in 
his  reception  would  not  only  do  credit  to  themselves  and  their 
noble  province,  but  to  this  city." 

"  On  the  evening  of  May  30th  two  companies  of  artillery  on 
the  West  Side,  under  the  command  of  Captains  Adams  and 
McLauchlan,  turned  out  and  paraded  through  the  various 
streets  in  Carleton,  the  men  made  an  excellent  appearance,  and 
marched  with  a  precision  and  regularity  that  would  have  been 
creditable  to  a  body  of  soldiers  of  the  line.  Previous  to  their 
marching  they  were  inspected  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster. 
After  considerable  marching  and  counter  marching  they  escorted 
the  Lieutenant-Colonel  to  the  ferry  boat  where  they  were  drawn 
up  in  line  and  addressed  by  the  Colonel, — who  complimented 
them  on  the  appearance  they  made,  and  upon  the  proficiency 
they  had  made  in  their  drill.  The  men  then  marched  back  to 
the  armory  and  soon  after  dispersed." 

There  was  also  an  inspection  at  the  Barrack  square  on  June 
I  St,  by  Major-General  Trollope,  at  which  the  artillery  and  city 
volunteer  companies  were  present. 


90  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

So  began  the  later  .history  of  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment 
of  Artillery,  bright  with  earnestness  and  full  of  endeavor,  and 
though  the  incidents  which  follow  may  be  less  thriUing  than 
those  which  precede  them,  yet  credit  must  be  given  for  the 
motives  which  gave  rise  to  this  activity.  For,  strange  to  say, 
while  a  threatened  war  with  France  in  the  early  days  of  our 
province  evoked  the  military  ardor  of  her  inhabitants,  to  the 
same  cause  may  be  ascribed  the  great  volunteer  movement  in 
the  mother  country  which  spread  to  our  land  with  the  result 
which  has  been  related.

Visit  of  the  Prince  of  Wales — Reception  at  Saint  John — The  Artillery 
'    under    Captains  Zhn-ant,    Pick,   Peters,  McLauchlan,  Adams  and 
Travis  take  Part — Major  Carter  in  Command — An  Inspection. 


^;^HREE  signal  guns  rapidly  fired  from  the  Fort  at  Partridge 
\J  Island  about  half-past  nine  o'clock  on  the  evening  of 
Thursday,  2nd  August,  i860,  announced  the  arrival  of 
H.  M.  S.  Styx  in  the  outer  harbor,  and  opened  the  greatest 
fete  ever  held  in  St.  John.  The  vessel  bore  His  Royal 
Highness  the  Prince  of  Wales,  and  an  eager  multitude 
anticipated  with  loyal  interest  the  first  welcome  to  the  Province 
of  an  heir  apparent  to  the  British  throne.  Not  since  the  visit 
of  the  Duke  of  Kent  in  1794  had  a  scion  of  royalty  been 
seen  in  the  city.  Those  who  recalled  that  event  were  few,  but 
nowhere  could  the  Prince  have  been  more  welcome  than  in 
that  city  which  had  been  erected  in  the  wilderness  by  the 
enthusiastic  loyalty  of  its  devoted  founders.  The  ship  with  her 
royal  passenger  moored  near  Reed's  Point  and  was  visited  by 
the  Lieutenant-Governor  and  Colonel  Hayne.  The  militia 
artillery  slept  little  that  night  and  when  the  morning  broke, 
in  the  most  beautiful  of  Queen's  weather,  the  men  were  at 
their  posts.  A  salute  from  all  the  forts,  joined  by  our  regi- 
ment of  artillery  rang  out  at  sunrise,  and  long  before  the  hour 
of  landing  the  batteries  of  Captain  Pick  and  Captain  Hurd 
Peters  were  on  duty  at  the  Ballast  \Yharf.  The  wharves  and 
Prince  William  street  were   thronged    by   the  whole  population 


92  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

of  the  city  reinforced  by  thousands  of  visitors,  joy  and  music 
adding  to  the  zest  of  the  occasion.  Captain  Durant's  com- 
pany was  stationed  at  the  entrance  to  the  Chipman  House, 
where  the  grand-father  of  the  Prince  had  lodged,  and  under 
their  guns  was  the  house  of  Captain  Colville,  the  first  com- 
mander of  their  company.  Captain  McLauchlan's  (Carleton) 
company  was  also  stationed  there.  Next  came  the  rifles  and 
infantry  companies,  the  national  societies,  the  cartmen  mounted, 
the  Sons  of  Temperance,  firemen  and  trades,  so  that  the  line 
extended  from  the  Chipman  House  to  the  place  of  landing  at 
Reed's  Point.  Each  company  of  the  artillery  and  other  volun- 
teers contributed  eighteen  men  to  a  guard  of  honor  which  was 
under  command  of  Colonel  Thurgar. 

At  half  past  ten  o'clock  the  Prince,  accompanied  by  the 
Duke  of  Newcastle,  Earl  St.  Germain  and  suite  was  rowed 
to  the  landing  stage  at  Reed's  point,  the  yards  of  the  war  ves- 
sel being  manned  and  a  salute  fired.  The  National  Anthem 
was  played  by  the  band  of  the  63rd  Regiment,  and  as  the 
Prince  stepped  on  shore  the  volunteers  presented  arms.  A 
large  procession  of  escort  was  formed  consisting  of  provincial 
and  corporation  officers,  the  judges^  members  of  legislative 
council  and  house  of  assembly,  and  office  bearers  of  the 
national  societies.  Triumphal  arches  had  been  erected  along 
the  route.  That  at  Reed's  point  was  styled  a  grand  Reception 
Pavilion  and  was  beautifully  decorated.  The  interior  of  the 
Pavilion  seated  sixteen  hundred  people.  Opposite  the  old 
city  building  which  then  stood  just  below  the  Colville  house, 
near  the  present  warehouse  of  W.  H.  Thorne  k  Co.,  the  civic 
arch,  a  magnificent  fabric,  had  been  constructed.  It  was  fifty 
feet  in  height  from  the  ground  to  the  inside  of  the  upper  arch 
so  that  persons  standing  in   the   Chipman  grounds  could  look 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  93 

under  it  to  Reed's  point.  Its  panels  were  suggestive  of  the 
e^irly  history  of  the  Province  and  the  date  "1783"  was  con- 
spicuously displayed.  Five  thousand  Sunday  school  children 
gathered  in  the  Chipman  grounds  greeted  H.  R.  H.  with  the 
national  anthem,  special  words  having  been  adapted  to  the 
music  for  the  occasion.  The  procession  then  retired  and  re- 
formed. It  was  reviewed  by  the  Prinxe  from  the  porch  of  the 
Court  House  on  Sidney  street.  First  came  the  band  of  the 
63rd  Regiment,  then  Captain  Pick's  company  of  the  N.  B.  R.  A. 
followed  by  the  other  companies  under  Captains  Durant, 
Adams, ^HuRD  Peters,  and  McLauchlan.  It  is  noteworthy 
that  in  the  newspaper  accounts  of  this  event  Captain  Pick's  is 
referred  to  as  the  'Prince  of  Wales'  company,  a  designation 
which  is  still  retained  by  No.  i.  After  the  artillery  came  other 
volunteer  companies  to  the  number  of  about  350  men.  The 
temperance  bodies,  firemen,  cordwainers,  millmen,  shipbuilders 
and  caulkers,  founders,  St.  George's,  St.  Patrick's  and  St. 
Andrew's  societies,  mounted  draymen  and  others  completed  the 
pageant.  The  officers  of  volunteers,  among  others,  attended 
the  levee  in  the  Court  House  at  which  addresses  were  pre- 
sented. The  Prince  was  expected  in  Carleton  in  the  after- 
noon but  owing  to  some  misunderstanding  as  to  arrangements 
did  not  arrive.  Captain  Adams'  company,  however,  was  on  hand 
and  fired  a  salute.  On  Saturday  morning  the  Prince  went  to 
Rothesay  by  special  train  and  was  received  by  a  salute  from 
the  artillery  'under  Captain  Durant,  and  a  guard  of  honor  from 
the  artillery  and  rifle  companies.  Leaving  Rothesay  by  the 
steamer  Forest  Queen  the  royal  party  arrived  at  Fredericton  by 
6  o'clock  and  was  received  by  a  guard  of  honor  from  the  militia 
companies  including  the  artillery  under  Captains  Berton  and 
Travis.     On  Sunday  H.  R.  H.  attended  the  cathedral  and  on 


94 


HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 


Monday  there  was  a  levee.  A  ball  was  held  in  the  evening 
at  which  the  Prince  remained  until  three  in  the  morning. 
On  Thursday  at  two  o'clock  he  arrived  at  Indiantown,  and 
was  received  with  presented  arms  by  companies  of  the  Infantry 
volunteers  under  Captains  Crookshank,  MacFarlane  and 
Stockton.  There  was  no  artillery  salute  as  Captains  Pick's 
and  Peters'  companies,  which  had  gone  to  Fredericton,  had 
not  been  able  to  return  in  time.  All  the  other  artillery  com- 
panies were  in  Carleton.  At  the  Suspension  Bridge  the  troops 
were  drawn  up  and  a  royal  salute  was  fired  from  Carleton 
heights.  At  the  city  line,  Carleton,  the  Prince  was  received 
by  the  firemen  of  Nos.  7  and  8  Engine  companies,  who  took 
the  horses  from  the  carriage,  which  was  drawn  by  hand  through 
the  streets  and  under  an  arch  on  King  street.  Here  the  party 
was  received  by  school  children,  the  militia  artillery  and  Wel- 
lington Bay  ship  builders.  The  Prince  visited  the  saw  mill  of 
Hon.  John  Robertson  and  witnessed  the  manufacture  of  a 
log  into  lumber.  Entering  a  barge  from  the  S^yx  at  Rodney 
Wharf  the  Prince  took  farewell  of  the  city,  Durant's,  Adams' 
and  McLauch LAN's  companies  firing  a  salute.  At  a  quarter 
to  five  the  Sfyx  weighed  anchor,  the  batteries  and  the  artillery 
companies  fired  their  parting  salutes  and  the  visit  of  England's 
future  King  was  ended. 

Though  time  and  the  official  programme  did  not  admit  of 
the  Prince  visiting  other  points  of  interest  in  the  province  yet 
the  enthusiam  was  none  the  less  in  Bathurst  where,  on  the 
day  that  the  Prince  arrived  in  St.  John  a  salute  was  fired  as 
soon  as  the  news  came,  nine  o'clock  at  night. 

In  connection  with  the  reception  of  the  Prince  militia  gen- 
eral orders  had  been  issued  calling  out,  amongst  others,  Cap- 
tain   Herton's    company    at    Fredericton,    Captains    Durant,

Pick,  Peters,  McLauchlan  and  Adams,  at  St.  John,  and 
Captain  Travis,  at  Gagetown.  The  whole  force,  including  one 
troop  of  cavalry  and  sixteen  infantry  and  rifle  companies,  was 
placed  under  the  command  of  Major  Carter,  then  in  com- 
mand of  H.  M.  63rd  Regiment.  Major  Carter,  who  very 
soon  afterwards  became  Lieutenant-Colonel,  on  assuming  com- 
mand of  the  militia  promulgated  the  following  order : 

Fredericton,  N.  B.,  July  24th,   j86o. 

Having  in  accordance  with  a  militia  general  order,  of  this 
day's  date,  assumed  command  of  the  several  companies  called 
out  by  His  Excellency  the  Commander-in-Chief,  I  undertake 
the  duty  with  which  His  Excellency  has  honored  me  in  the 
fullest  confidence  that  I  shall  receive  such  support  as  will  en- 
able me  to  perform  the  services  with  which  I  have  been  en- 
trusted with  every  credit  to  the  militia  of  New  Brunswick. 

(Signed)         W.  F.  Carter,  Major 

63rd  Reg't, 
Commanding  H.  M.  Troops  in  New  Brunswick. 

On  retiring  from  the  command  after  its  services  had  been 
performed  he  issued  the  following  general  order,  conveying  his 
appreciation  of  the  service  of  the  force  under  his  command  : — 

Fredericton,  N.  B.,  August  11,   i860. 

His  Excellency  the  Commander-in-chief  no  longer  requiring 
my  services  with  the  militia  force  which  was  called  out  for  the 
purpose  of  doing  all  honor  to  H.  R.  H.  the  Prince  of 
Wales,  I  cannot  resign  this  command  without  thanking  the 
whole  of  the  officers,  non-commissioned  officers  and  men 
for  the  able  and  zealous  manner  in  which  they  performed 
their  different  duties  during  that  period.  I  have  also  to 
return  my  best  acknowledgments  to  Lieutenant-Colonel  Hayne, 
adjutant-general  of  militia,  and  other  field  officers  who  gave 
me  their  valuable  assistance  on  that  occasion.  My  con- 
nection with    the   militia   of   New    Brunswick    will   ever  be  re-

Commanding  H.   M.   troops  in  New  Brunswick. 

Major  Carter  was  assisted  in  the  performance  of  his  duties 
by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Thurgar,  Lieutenant-Colonel  Gray, 
Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster,  N.  B.  R.  A. ;  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Robertson,  Major  Melick,  N.  B.  R.  A.,  and  Captain  Mount,

adjutant-general ;  Lieutenant-Colonel  Drury,  deputy  quarter 
master  general,  and  Captain  Minchin,  deputy  adjutant-general. 

The  following  general  order  was  also  issued  upon  Major 
Carter  transferring  his  command  : — 

Fredericton,  August  13th,   i860. 

Major  Carter,  63rd  Regiment,  commanding  Her  Majesty's 
troops  in  New  Brunswick,  has  submitted  to  His  Excellency 
the  Commander-in-chief  a  highly  satisfactory  report  of  the  con- 
duct of  the  whole  of  the  militia  force,  cavalry,  artillery  and 
infantry  recently  under  his  command,  not  only  w^hile  they  were 
under  arms,  but  also  during  the  whole  period  for  which  they 
were  called  out. 

His  Excellency  has  had  an  opportunity  of  personally  observ- 
ing their  appearance  and  the  manner  in  which  they  performed 
their  duties  during  the  visit  of  H.  R.  H.  the  Prince  of 
Wales,  and  he  gladly  avails  himself  of  this  occasion  to  ex- 
press his  warm  approbation  of  their  steady  and  soldier-like 
behaviour. 

His  Excellency  the  Commander-in-chief  has  received  from  H. 
R.  H.  the  Prince  of  Wales  permission  to  announce  that  it 
is  the  intention  of  H.  R.  H.  to  present  a  "  Challenge  Cup " 
(to  be  competed  for  every  year)  as  a  prize  for  the  best  marks- 
man among  the  companies  of  militia,  in  uniform,  which  have 
volunteered  or  may  volunteer  for  drill  and  exercise.  His  Ex- 
cellency is  sure  that  this  announcement  will  be  received  as 
a    nK^st    gratifying    recognition    on    the    part    of    H.     R.     H.

of  the  soldier-like  and  steady  conduct  of  the  militia  force  called 
out  by  His  Excellency's  proclamation  of  the  25th  ult.,  and  of 
the  zeal  which  induced  them  to  volunteer  for  drill  and  ex- 
ercise ;  and  he  has  no  doubt  that  the  same  spirit  which 
assembled  together  so  large  a  force  of  militia  of  all  arms  (uni- 
formed at  their  own  expense)  during  H.  R.  H.  visit,  will  continue 
to  animate  them  and  extend  to  every  battahon  of  militia  in 
the  Province.  The  officer  in  command  of  every  company  of 
militia  volunteering  for  drill  and  exercise  may  apply  to  His 
Excellency  the  Commander-in-Chief  for  service  ammunition  for 
practice,  (at  the  rate  of  five  rounds  per  man  in  uniform)  on 
shewing  th^at  a  suitable  and  safe  practice  ground  has  been 
marked  and  secured  for  the  company.

There  are  yet  a  few  more  incidents  to  be  noted  in  this 
eventful  year,  and  though  they  naturally  attracted  much  less 
attention  than  those  just  related,  yet  some  of  them  are  by  no 
means  devoid  of  interest.  On  30th  May,  i860,  Isaac  Naish 
was  gazetted  first,  and  Alexander  Mitchell  second,  lieuten- 
ant. There  is  nothing  to  show  to  which  company  these 
gentlemen  were  attached,  but  as  on  25th  March,  1861,  Mit- 
chell was  promoted  to  the  first  *  lieutenantcy  vice  Naish, 
deceased,  and  is  remembered  by  Sir  John  C.  Allen  as  having 
been  in  Fredericton,  it  is  probable  that  both  were  in  Captain 
John  Allen's  company  which  was  then  being  formed. 

In  Captain  Adams'  company  Joseph  Coram  resigned  his 
commission  and  was  succeeded  by  Lieutenant  James  Quinton, 
from  St.  John  County  militia ;  while  in  Captain  Durant's 
company  Thomas  C.  Humbert  gave  way  to  Alexander 
Rankine. 

Another  officer  was  appointed  to  Captain  McLauchlan's 
company  in  the  person  of  George  Hunter  Clark  as  a  second 
lieutenant. 


98  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

A  meeting  of  the  officers  of  militia  of  the  city  of  Saint 
John  was  held  on  August  nth  in  the  parlor  of  No.  2  Fire 
Engine  house,  at  which  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster,  Captains 
Mount,  Pick,  Durant  and  Adams,  Lieutenants  Melick, 
Sneden,  Thomas,  Quinton,  McLachlan,  Taylor  and  Ran- 
kine  of  the  artillery  were  present  with  quite  a  large  number 
of  others.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  occupied  the  chair  and 
stated  that  the  object  of  the  meeting  was  to  enable  officers  to 
become  personally  acquainted  and  for  the  cultivation  of  the 
unanimity  of  sentiment  essential  to  the  success  of  the  volunteer 
movement.  As  an  outcome  of  his  suggestions  it  was  resolved 
that  the  militia  companies  of  St.  John  should  assemble  for  a 
general  inspection  on  26th  September  and  that  Colonel  Thur- 
gar  be  invited  to  act  as  inspecting  officer.  A  request  was 
also  sent  to  the  Lieutenant-Governor  for  a  supply  of  artillery 
and  rifle  ammunition  to  enable  practice  to  be  carried  on. 

The  "Morning  News"  of  September  28th  says  that  the 
general  appearance  of  the  men  at  this  inspection  was  excellent. 
'The  Carleton  artillery  excelled  in  their  marching  with  small 
'arms  and  in  their  manual  exercise,  while  Captain  Peters' 
'(Portland)  artillery  with  field  pieces  went  through  their  march- 
'ing  in  very  good  order.  The  other  bodies  on  the  ground 
'were  the  Prince  of  Wales  (Pick's),  Captain  Durant's  and 
'Captain  Adams'  artillery  companies,  Captain  Crookshank's 
'  rifles — these  represented  the    city  ;   Captain  Stockton's    Port- 

*  land  rifles ;   also  companies  of    rifles    from    Pisarinco,    Golden 

*  Grove  and  Milkish,  (Captain  MacFarlane's  Scottish  company 
'were  not  out) — the  whole  force  being  under  the  command  of 
'  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster.  After  the  review  the  troops,  ac- 
'companied  by  the  Courtenay  Bay_  band,  marched  through 
'several  of  the  streets,  and  in  the  evening  Colonel  Thurgar 
'  gave  the  officers  a  luncheon  at  the  Waverley  House.'

The  report  of  the  adjutant-general,  Colonel  Hayne,  for  i860 
expressed  a  high  appreciation  of  the  work  which  had  been 
done.  He  advocated  greater  encouragement  to  rifle  shooting 
by  increasing  the  allowance  of  ammunition,  and  pointed  out 
that  the  Canadian  government  allowed  one  hundred  and  forty 
rounds  of  ammunition  annually  to  each  company  of  artillery. 
Without  such  assistance  as  this  they  could  not  acquire  a  prac- 
tical knowledge  of  gunnery.  During  the  year  drill  instructors 
had  been  loaned  by  the  colonel  of  the  63rd  regiment  and  a 
great  deal  had  been  achieved  with  their  assistance,  but  he 
emphasized  the  necessity  of  ofificers  qualifying  themselves  to  in- 
struct their  men.  The  report  also  shows  the  existence  of  the 
Woodstock  company  still  under  Captain  Wetmore,  one  at 
Northumberland  under  Captain  Carmichael,  and  one  at  St. 
John  under  Captain  Richard  Simonds.  The  latter  as  before 
stated  scarcely  had  any  potential  existence  as  artillery.

^IJ^HE  first  event  of  1861  was  the  assembly  of  Captain  Mc- 
\^  Lauchlan's  (Carleton)  company  to  the  number  of  thirty- 
four,  on  January  21st  for  the  purpose  of  making  a 
presentation  to  their  instructor,  Corporal  James  Anderson  of 
the  R.  A.  The  company  was  then  styled  '  Havelock  Battery 
No.  6.'  They  went  through  the  manual  and  firing  exercises 
and  formed  in  square  when  the  presentation  was  made.  An 
address  was  read  by  Sergeant  William  J.  McCordock,  and 
^was  signed  by  himself,  Wm.  Browne,  Fred.  R.  Linde  and 
George  F.  Harding.  The  former  is  now  an  official  of  the 
public  works  department  of  Canada  and  the  latter  is  an  officer 
in  the  treasury  department  of  the  city  of  St.  John.  John  A. 
Chesley,  now  M.  P.  for  St.  John,  was  then  one  of  the  bom- 
bardiers. 

A  lecture  was  deliv^sred  in  the  Mechanics'  Institute  on  Feb- 
ruary 1 8th  by  Captain  Hurd  Peters  upon  "  Our  Volunteers." 
The  subjects  of  the  lecture  attended  in  uniform,  there  being 
present  the  City,  Carleton  and  Portland  artillery  companies, 
Pisarinco,  Golden  Grove  and  Milkish  rifles,  besides  the  city 
rifle  companies  of  Captains  MacFarlane,  Crookshank  and 
Travis.     Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  and  other  officers  occupied

the  platform.  Captain  Peters,  among  other  things,  referred 
to  the  establishment  of  the  1793  company,  and  read  the  names 
from  the  original  roll,  remarking  that  '  every  year  since  the 
'  thunder  of  their  guns  might  be  heard  on  some  national 
'  holiday.' 

Changes  were  rapid  in  the  Colville  company.  Captain 
Lewis  Durant  retired  retaining  his  rank  on  i8th  March,  and 
on  13th  April  was  succeeded  by  Lieutenant  James  G.  Melick, 
who  also  retired  with  rank  on  the  same  day.  This  was  fol- 
lowed by  the  promotion  of  Lieutenant  Alex.  Rankine,  who 
had  joined  in  the  previous  year.  Wm.  Frederick  Deacon 
and  Roger  Hunter  were  also  posted  to  the  company  as 
lieutenants.  This  company,  says  Captain  Rankine,  originally 
drilled  in  the  Barrack  Square,  afterwards  on  King  street  (east), 
near  St.  John  Presbyterian  church.  The  guns  were  kept  by 
Major  Melick.  Lieutenant  Deacon  had  been  in  the  British 
army  and  had  served  in  the  Crimea.  He  was  very  active  in 
an  important  event,  the  procuring  of  the  regimental  colors, 
which  is  elsewhere  recorded. 

The  Queen's  birthday  was  celebrated  in  much  the  usual 
manner,  there  being  a  review  of  the  volunteers  and  a  salute 
fired  by  the  artillery.  All  the  St.  John  companies  turned  out 
on  this  occasion,  and  for  the  first  time  appeared  the  company 
commanded  by  Captain  B.  Lester  Peters,  long  known  as  the 
'Kid  Glove  battery.' 

On  the  29th  May  H.  R.  H.  Prince  Alfred  arrived  at  St. 
John  from  Halifax  and  spent  a  day  in  the  city.  On  his  de- 
parture on  the  morning  of  the  31st  two  companies  of  artillery 
fired  a  salute.  The  boys  in  blue  apparently  thought  that  some 
want  of  respect  was  evinced  toward  the  Prince  by  their  not 
being    called    out    to    do   him    honor   and  endeavored  in  their 


102  HISTORICAL   RECORDS    OF    THE 

own  way  to  supply  the  omission.  The  reason  was,  however, 
the  recent  death  of  the  Duchess  of  Kent,  mother  of  Her 
Majesty.  A  general  order  issued  shortly  afterwards  informed 
the  militia  of  St.  John  that  His  Royal  Highness  was  fully 
aware,  that  the  rest  of  the  force  only  abstained  from  a  demon- 
stration because  of  the  order  of  the  Commander  in-Chief,  and 
while  His  Excellency  attributed  to  the  excitement  of  the  moment 
the  partial  disobedience  of  the  order,  evinced  by  the  salute  just 
mentioned,  he  assured  the  companies  by  whom  the  order  was 
obeyed  that  their  absence  was  attributable  only  to  their  sense 
of  discipline  and  to  their  desire  to  show  that  in  their  military 
capacity  they  could  be  trusted  to  obey  orders.  The  rebuke 
was  rather  caustic,  and  it  may  safely  be  assumed  that  the 
artillery  never  again  disobeyed  a  general  order.  The  punish- 
ment was  moderate,  however,  compared  with  that  which  in  later 
years  was  meted  out  to  another  St.  John  corps  which  disobeyed 
orders  calling  them  out  for  duty. 

The  annual  inspection  on  29th  August  w^as  a  very  creditable 
affair.  Colonel  Thurgar  commanded  the  parade  and  the 
volunteers  were  inspected  by  Major  Rynd  of  H.  M.  62nd 
Regiment.  Captains  Pick's  and  Hurd  Peters'  companies 
were  put  through  their  field  gun  drill  by  Lieutenant  Macart- 
ney of  the  R.  A.,  and  are  said  to  have  acquitted  themselves 
to  his  entire  satisfaction.  Captain  B.  Lester  Peters'  com- 
pany also  performed  garrison  gun  drill  on  that  occasion  in  a 
manner  reflecting  great  credit  upon  themselves. 

Hon.  Arthur  Hamilton  Gordon,  C.  M.  G.,  assumed  office 
as  Lieutenant-Governor  of  the  province  on  26th  October,  and 
among  the  gentlemen  appointed  as  his  aides-de-camp  was  Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Hayne. 

Tn  this  year,  on  2nd  September,   Martin  Hunter  Peters,

M.  D„  was  gazetlfed  lieutenant  of  Captain  Adams'  company, 
vice  Geo.  J.  Stackhouse,  resigned,  and  thus  began  the  militia 
career  of  an  accurate  and  enthusiastic  officer. 

During  the  year  the  efforts  of  Lieutenant  Deacon  to  obtain 
for  the  corps  a  set  of  colors  had  been  very  successful,  and  in 
December  the  silken  trophies  arrived  from  England.  Their 
presentation  to  the  regiment  was  an  interesting  and  imposing 
event.  The  following  is  an  account  taken  from  a  newspaper 
of  the  time  : — 

The  Colors  recently  procured  in  England  for  the  New  Bruns- 
wick Regiment  of  Artillery  were  presented  at  the  Institute  last 
evening  (i8th  December).  The  hall  was  filled  to  overflowing 
shortly  after  seven  o'clock,  and  hundreds  of  people  retired  un- 
able to  procure  admittance.  Large  numbers  of  those  present 
remained  standing^  during  the  whole  of  the  evening,  it  being 
impossible  to  obtain  seats  for  all  who  gained  admittance. 

The  volunteers  in  and  about  the  city  attended  in  large  force 
and  made  quite  an  interesting  appearance.  About  eight  o'clock 
Captain  Rankine's  company,  carrying  the  colors  furled,  entered 
the  hall  and  marched  upon  the  platform,  the  City  Band  play- 
ing "British  Grenadiers."  The  colors  were  then  unfurled,  the 
band  playing  "  Rule  Brittania." 

Lieutenant-Colonel  Thurgar  informed  the  audience  that  the 
colors  were  now  to  be  presented  in  the  name  of  the  ladies  of 
St.  John,  and  he  called  upon  Rev.  Dr.  Gray  to  consecrate 
them. 

The  address  of  presentation  was  delivered,  extempore,  by 
Lieutenant-Colonel  Gray.  He  spoke  (an  unusual  thing  for 
him)  so  low  as  to  be  heard  quite  indistinctly  in  the  further 
part  of  the  house.  Addressing  himself  to  the  officers  and  men 
of  the  artillery  he  said  that  he  was  honored  by  the  command 
of  the  ladies  of  the  City  and  County  to  represent  them  on  this 
occasion.  What,  he  asked,  is  the  purpose  that  has  brought 
us  together  ?  This  banner  (pointing  to  the  dark  blue  banner) 
beautiful  as  it  is,  is  but  the  product  of  the  worm ;  the  work 
upon  it  is  that  of  frail,  though,  perhaps,  young  and  beautiful 
hands.     Yet    it  lives,  it  moves,    it    is    the    embodiment   of  the 


I04  HISTORICAL   RECORDS    OF   THE 

triumphs  and  glories  of  the  arms  of  EnglanlS.  This  unstained 
banner  of  your  country's  honor  is  about  to  be  committed  to 
your  care,  are  you  prepared  to  receive  it  and  maintain  the 
purity  of  its  unsulHed  character  ?  It  has  waved  triumphantly 
in  Spain  and  France  and  India,  in  every  quarter  of  the  globe, 
and  whether  carried  forward  to  glorious  victory  or  borne  back 
in  honorable  retreat,  it  has  never  been  stained — on  its  folds 
no  bar  sinister  shows  it  to  have  been  disgraced.  You,  volun- 
teers, are  not  asked  to  carry  this  flag  beyond  the  confines  of 
your  own  province ;  you  are  asked  to  stand  by  your  own  homes, 
to  defend,  if  need  be,  those  dear  ones  who  look  to  you  for 
support  and  protection.  In  the  heart  of  every  truly  brave  man 
there  will  be,  I  am  sure,  a  warm  response  to  the  prayer  made 
this  evening,  that  the  dark  cloud  which  now  hovers  over  our 
country  may  be  averted ;  but,  if  called  upon,  not  one  of  you 
would  hesitate  to  discharge  your»duties  as  becomes  men,  in  the 
face  of  danger,  difficulty  and  death.  In  you  are  embodied  the 
three  great  nations  from  which  our  forefathers  came.  Each  of 
them  has  its  peculiar  characters.  The  Irishman  is  quick,  fear- 
less, joyous  and  obedient.  He  fights  with  a  light  heart  for  he 
loves  it ;  his  joyous  temperament  sustains  him  in  many  a  try- 
ing situation,  while  his  ready  obedience  to  command  impels 
him  forward  at  the  call  of  duty. 

The  Scotchman  fights  for  the  love  of  home,  one  of  the 
strongest  feelings  of  his  breast,  and  no  matter  what  beautiful 
country  or  sunny  land  he  may  be  in,  no  kindred  appears  to 
him  like  his  own,  no  clan  like  his,  and  his  heart  ever  recurs 
with  warm  feeling  to  the  mossy  heaths  and  barren  moors  of 
his  native  land,  and  for  that  land  he  sheds  his  blood  with 
ready  willingness.  The  Englishman  fights  because  it  is  a  duty 
he  has  to  do.  Gloomy,  savage,  almost  relentless  when  face  to 
face  with  the  foe,  he  knows  no  shrinking  and  whether  victorious 
or  beaten,  to  him  it  is  the  same,  he  perseveres  with  equal 
determination.  All  are  ready,  as  you  should  be,  to  maintain 
the  integrity  of  that  flag,  under  which  he  who  seeks  protection 
is  sure  to  find-  it  or  a  nation  to  avenge  his  wrongs.  Mr.  Gray 
then  alluded  to  the  date,  1793,  on  the  flags,  commending  the 
principles  of  the  loyalists,  and  ended  by  asking  the  volunteers 
if  they  were  prepared  faithfully,  manfully  and  fearlessly  to  pre- 
HTve  the  colors  which  were  to  be  presented  to  them.

In  response  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  replied  as  follows  : — 

Colonel  Gray, — In  the  absence  of  Colonel  Hayne.  our  com- 
manding officer,  who  was  invited  by  the  committee  of  arrange- 
ments to  take  his  part  in  the  ceremonies  on  this  occasion,  it 
becomes  my  duty,  on  behalf  of  the  officers,  non-commissioned 
officers  and  gunners  of  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artil- 
lery, to  return  their  warmest  thanks  for  the  magnificent  gift 
which  they  have  this  night  received  at  the  hands  of  Miss 
Gray  from  the  ladies  of  the  City  and  County  of  St.  John. 

These  colors  come  to  our  hands  unstained.  In  their  virgin 
purity,  fresh  from  the  hands  of  youth  and  innocence,  we  receive 
them  ;  most  faithfully  will  we  defend  them,  and  whatever  diffi- 
culties may  arise,  in  consequence  of  the  present  most  unhappy 
condition  of  political  affairs  on  this  continent,  we  shall  endeavor 
with  the  blessing  of  Almighty  God  to  transmit  them  to  our 
successors  untarnished. 

The  nucleus  of  our  regiment  dates  its  organization  from  the 
4th  day  of  May,  1793,  ten  short  years  subsequent  to  the  land- 
ing of  the  loyalists,  and  was  known  as  the  Loyal  Artillery.  Its 
ranks,  to  the  number  of  ninety-four,  were  filled  by  a  body  of 
Englishmen,  Irishmen,  Scotchmen  and  British  Americans,  com- 
prising the  principal  merchants  and  ship  owners  of  the  city  at 
that  period ;  men  of  whose  moral  worth  any  community  in  the 
world  might  feel  justly  proud.  Its  first  captain  was  John 
Colville,  founder  of  the  commercial  firm  of  Crookshank  &amp; 
Johnston.  Its  first  sergeant  was  the  venerable  and  highly 
esteemed   John  Ward. 

Our  vocations  are  those  of  peace.  Our  several  duties  and 
positions  in  life  preclude  that  close  application  to  the  study  of 
military  affairs  which  is  expected  and  required  from  those 
whose  lives  are  devoted  to  the  profession  of  arms,  consequently, 
we  should  not  be  expected  to  possess  that  thorough  knowledge 
of  all  those  little  niceties  of  military  etiquette  which  are  by 
some  considered  so  essentially  necessary.  We  are  all  willing 
and  desirous  to  learn,  and  ready  at  all  times  to  give  a  cheer- 
ful response  to  the  order  of  our  superior  officer ; — none,  other 
than  weak  minds,  would  smile  at  our  imperfections ;  and  none 
but  imbeciles  would,  under  our  peculiar  circumstances,  jeeringly 
apply  to  us  the  term  unmilitary. 

When  the  honor  of  our  Queen  or  the  interests  of  our  country 


Io6  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THF: 

demand  our  active  services,  under  the  guiding  hand  of  the 
Most  High,  those  services  will  be  rendered.  The  sacredness 
of  our  homes  and  the  purity  of  our  families  must  be  preserved 
from  the  polluting  touch  of  an  invading  foe.  From  our  progen- 
itors we  inherit  those  principles  of  loyalty  and  patriotism  by 
which  they  were  governed.  As  the  descendants  of  Englishmen, 
Irishmen,  Scotchmen,  and  British  American  Loyalists,  we  are 
proud  of  our  nationality,  and  thank  that  merciful  Providence 
who  has  made  us  the  subjects  of  a  Sovereign  whose  manifold 
virtues  as  daughter,  wife,  mother  and  queen,  entitle  her  to  the 
fullest  confidence  of  all  her  subjects,  as  well  as  to  the  respect 
and  admiration  of  the  whole  civilized  world. 

Miss  Gray  then  presented  the  flags  to  Lieutenant  Hunter 
and  Lieutenant  M.  H.  Peters,  the  juniors  of  the  regiment, 
simply  saying  that  she  made  the  presentation. 

The  colors  were  then  marched  into  the*  ranks,  the  band 
playing  "God  Save  the  Queen,"  after  which  three  rousing 
cheers  were  given  for  the  Queen,  three  for  the  Lieutenant- 
Governor,  and  three  for  the  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of 
Artillery. 

Lieutenant-Colonel  Thurgar  thanked  the  Rev.  Dr.  Gray 
for  his  attendance  and  assistance. 

The  "Queen's  Color"  is  a  Union  Jack  with  the  crown 
worked  in  floss,  and  1793  beneath  worked  in  figures    of  gold. 

The  "Regimental  Color"  is  a  blue  ensign — in  the  centre  is 
a  figure  with  the  letters  "New  Brunswick"  encircled  by  a 
wreath  and  surmounted  with  the  crown,  all  beautifully  wrought 
in  floss,  with  1793  in  figures  of  gold  beneath.  Both  colors  are 
made  of  the  heaviest  and  most  costly  description  of  silk,  and 
as  there  is  a  total  absence  of  paint  of  either  color,  they  are 
calculated  to  do  service   for  many  years. 

An  incidental  reference  has  been  made  to  Captain  B.  Lester 
Peters'  battery.  The  history  of  this  fine  organization,  of  the 
memory  of  which  the  artillery  and  citizens  are  still  proud, 
begins  with  an  order  of  25th  March,  1 86 1, , transferring  Lieu- 
tenant B.  Lester  Peters  from  the  St.  John  City  Mihtia  to 
the  N.  B.  R.  A.  as  captain,  for  garrison  gun  duty.  Previous 
to  this,  and  in  fact  until    the    Fenian-  trouble,  there  was  prac- 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  I07 

tically  no  garrison  gun  drill  done  by  the  regiment.  Captain 
Peters'  battery  generally  used  the  field  pieces,  but  was  the 
pioneer  in  the  use  of  the  heavier  ordnance.  The  formation  of 
the  battery  was  accomplished  under  circumstances  which  need 
not  be  narrated.  Suffice  it  to  say  that  a  number  of  men  from 
Captain  Pick's  battery  withdrew  and  became  members  of  the 
new  battery,  and  after  approaching  several  other  gentlemen, 
obtained  B.  Lester  Peters  as  their  commanding  officer.  It 
was  a  wise  choice,  and  whatever  may  have  been  the  feeling 
engendered  at  the  time  by  what  was  termed  the  'revolt,'  it 
was  productive  of  good  to  the  N.  B.  R.  A.,  which  for  nearly 
eight  years  had  two  splendid  batteries  whose  efficiency  was  in- 
creased by  rivalry.  While  Captain  Peters'  battery  existed,  it,  as 
well  as  Captain  Pick's,  received  deserved  commendation  from  all 
quarters,  military  as  well  as  civil,  and  the  praise  of  one  is  no 
disparagement  of  the  other.  The  rivalry,  not  friendly  at  first, 
which  existed  between  the  organizations  was  productive  of  a 
higher  state  of  efficiency  in  both,  and  probably  to-day  the  old 
members  of  the  Prince  of  Wales  battery  are  as  proud  as  the 
survivors  of  the  '  Kid  Glove  battery '  of  the  successes  of  the 
latter.  With  Captain  Peters  were  associated  Lieutenants  R.  R. 
Sneden,  George  E.  Thomas  and  F.  G.  W.  Lansdowne,  all 
from  Captain  Pick's  battery.  The  roll  shows  during  its  history 
the  names  of  scores  of  young  men,  many  of  whom  have  made 
a  reputation  in  after  life.  There  was  much  about  the  person- 
ality of  the  captain  to  attract  men.  Tall,  of  commanding 
presence,  with  a  regal  air  which  seems  to  belong  almost  ex- 
clusively to  a  generation  that  has  passed  away,  he  appeared  to 
men  of  the  present  day  the  embodiment  of  dignity  and  reserve. 
And  yet  his  old  comrades  after  pointing  out  the  strictness  of 
the  discipline  which  he  enforced,  relate  with  fondness  incidents 


■^ 


Io8  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

of  the  social  meetings  at  which  the  'Captain'  unbent,  and  the 
zest  with  which  he  entered  into  the  sport  and  merriment  of 
the  hour.  After  serving  for  upwards  of  a  quarter  of  a  century 
as  Common  Clerk  of  the  city  of  St.  John,  an  office  for  which 
he  made  traditions,  he  was  elevated  to  the  post  of  County 
Court  Judge,  which  office  he  held  until  his  death  in   1894. 

Through  great  good  fortune  the  rolls  of  his  battery  and  the 
minute  books  of  their  meetings  have  been  preserved.  All  bear 
the  emphasis  of  his  character.  Exactness  characterizes  every 
entry  and  the  records  form  a  history.  Among  the  secretaries 
of  the  battery  is  found  I.  Allen  Jack,  Esq.,  who,  until  a  year 
ago,  filled  the  important  office  of  Recorder  of  St.  John  and 
left  upon  the  history  of  that  office  an  abiding  influence  and 
power  that  will,  like  his  captain's  record,  remain  long  after  the 
memory  of  his  day  has  faded. 

The  meetings  of  which  such  a  record  was  kept  are  from 
1862  to  1864  when  the  new  militia  law  removed  the  self  gov- 
erning feature  of  the  organization.  The  minutes  of  that  period, 
however,  breathe  in  their  brief  chronicle  of  events  a  reverence 
which  amounts  to  affection  for  the  'captain.'  It  was  well  that 
Captain  B.  Lester  Peters  never  had  a  successor,  for  those 
qualities  which  marked  his  leadership  are  rare  among  men. 

There  are  humorous  incidents,  too,  which  are  told  by  old 
members  who  are  now  no  longer  'the  boys.'  One  in  particular 
is  well  worth  relating.  The  captain's  thoroughness  in  discipline 
had  caused  him  to  lecture  the  battery  on  the  unsoldierliness 
of  turning  out  of  the  way  to  avoid  a  bad  spot  on  the  street. 
The  boys  treasured  the  lecture  and  waited  an  opportunity  to 
show  their  appreciation  of  it.  It  soon  came.  Ordered  down 
to  the  Barracks  for  drill  one  day  the  leading  files  noticed  a 
trench  cut  more  than    half   way  across    the   road,  and  directly

in  the  line  of  march.  A  man  was  in  it  plying  the  pick  and 
shovel  vigorously,  and  had  piled  up  large  mounds  of  stiff  brick 
cky  on  either  side  of  the  excavation.  The  battery  was  in 
charge  of  Lieutenant  Sneden,  and  the  captain  was  at  a 
distance  walking  with  some  friends,  and  for  once  not  paying 
any  attention  to  his  battery.  One  of  the  leading  men  was  the 
late  paymaster  of  our  corps,  George  F.  Smith.  He  and  his 
comrades  kept  their  direction  perfectly  and  leaped  over  the 
trench  causing  the  loose  clay  to  fall  in  on  the  poor  laborer, 
who  got  out  as  quickly  as  possible.  File  after  file  leaped  over 
tumbling  the  clay  in  until  the  trench  was  nearly  full.  Not  a 
man  was  so  unsoldierly  as  to  turn  out  of  the  way.  The  cap- 
tain's lecture  was  duly  heeded,  and  probably  no  one  better 
enjoyed  the  joke  than  he. 

The  following  is  a  transcript  of  the  roll  book.  It  appears 
from  the  minutes  that  there  must  have  been  an  earlier  roll  in 
1 86 1,  but  it  can  not  be  found.  A  footnote  gives  the  additions 
so  far  as  they  can  be  gathered.

Calhoun,  G.  F,  Munroe,  G.  E.  Thorne,  Geo.  N.  Robinson, 
G.  Fred  Sancton,  H.  D.  Troop  (Mr.  Troop  joined  later  on), 
H.  Hanselpeck:er,  Henry  Rainnie,  C.  D.  Thompson,  Simeon 
Phillips,  Geo.  Mason,  jr.,  and  Geo.  McDonald. 

The  names  of  John  Taylor,  E.  N.  Stewart,  George 
Flewelling,  Sidney  Patterson,  James  Manchester,  S.  W. 
Lee,  Wm.  Fleming,  Henry  F.  Perley,  Ingersoll  Brown, 
F.  S.  Hanford,  Jer.  Drake  and  Henry  Kendall  were  ac- 
cepted. They  are  not  on  the  roll  and  do  not  appear  to  have 
been  struck  off  any  previous  roll.  The  inference  is  that  they 
were  accepted  as  members  but  never  joined  the  battery. 

The  meeting  for  organization  was  held  January  4,  1861,  in 
the  parlor  of  No  5  Engine  house,  Germain  street.  Richard 
D.  Davis  was  secretary  and  W.  A.  Lockhart,  treasurer.  In 
March  they  changed  to  Union  Hall,  Horsfield  street  and  elected 
W.  A.  Lockhart,  ist,  Peter  R.  Inches,  2nd,  and  Geo.  L. 
Foster,  3rd  sergeant.  S.  K.  Foster,  jr.,  was  also  chosen 
third  bombardier.  On  the  i8th  May  they  fired  a  salute  of 
nineteen  guns  with  the  Royal  Artillery  ordnance  at  the  bar- 
racks. At  the  24th  May  parade  of  that  year  they  fell  in  on 
the  right  of  the  rifle  companies,  forty-two  strong;  'having,' 
says  the  record,  '  no  rifles  to  carry  or  cannon  to  use.'  Captain 
Peters  gave  a  dinner  at  the  Waverley  hotel  in  the  evening. 

The  men  got  their  rifles  on  ist  July.  In  the  next  March 
Bombardier  Gallagher  became  corporal  and  W.  S.  Berton 
bombardier.  On  the  9th  of  that  month  the  battery  was  visited 
at  its  drill  room,  then  in  the  Wiggins  building,  Johnston's 
wharf,  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  and  Major  Melick. 
Gunner  Edward  Jones  was  called  to  the  front  and  presented 
with  the  Prince  of  Wales  medal  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster. 

On   14th  July,    1862,    Sergeant  Lockhart  became    sergeant- 


N     B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  II 5 

major ;  Corporal  Robinson,  sergeant ;  Bombardiers  Davidson 
and  S.  K.  Foster,  corporals ;  George  F.  Smith  and  John 
Morehouse  became  bombardiers. 

The  battery,  at  a  meeting  on  September  9th,  passed  resolu- 
tions of  regret  upon  the  death  of  an  honorary  member  who 
had  befriended  them,  Mr.  Moses  H.  Perley,  H.  M.  Commis- 
sioner of  British  North  American  Fisheries,  who  had  died  on  1 7th 
August  at  Forteau,  I^brador.  On  May  nth,  1863,  the  thanks 
of  the  battery  were^  returned  to  the  captain  for  the  presentation 
of  a  bugle  and  trumpet  to  them,  and  on  the  succeeding  i8th 
royal  salutes  were  fired  at  King  Square  at  6  a.  m.  and  at 
Reed's  point  at  noon.  A  little  later  in  the  month,  at  request 
of  Judge  Wilmot,  two  detachments  drilled  for  his  inspection. 
In  this  year  J.  Fred  Seely  and  W.  C.  Perley  became  bom- 
bardiers: Bombardier  Chamberlain,  corporal,  was  succeeded  on 
his  leaving  the  city  by  Bombardier  Seely,  and  we  read  on  14th 
March,  1864,  that  the  "Captain  had  much  pleasure  in  accept- 
ing the  picture  of  the  '  Nippers '  presented  to  him  by  No.  i 
detachment."  The  'Nippers'  were  a  gun  detachment  famous 
for  their  celerity  and  precision,  and  their  efficiency  has  never 
been  excelled  by  any  detachment  of  the  regiment  or  brigade. 

On  1 8th  April  Sergeant  Inches  became  sergeant-major ;  Cor- 
poral Foster,  a  sergeant ;  Bombardier  Perley,  corporal.  Gun- 
ners Reed  and  Cameron,  bombardiers.  Then  on  13th  June, 
we  read  that,  proposed  by  Gunner  Langan,  Joseph  B.  Stubbs 
was  accepted  as  a  member,  and  the  pleasant  record  told  by 
secretaries  R.  D.  Davis,  A.  Chamberlain,  I.  Allen  Jack 
and  R.  Broqks  Peters  comes  to  a  close. 

Years  afterwards,  on  the  2nd  July,  1869,  the  'members  and 
friends  of  No.  2  Battery  St.  John  Volunteer  Artillery,'  to  the  num- 
ber of  forty,  sat  down  to  dine  at  Stubb's  Hotel.     Captain,  then 


Il6  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel  B.  Lester  Peters  was  presented 
with  a  handsome  silver  cup,  engraved  with  his  arms  and  motto, 
'  Sans  Dieu  Rien^'  and  bearing  this  inscription  :  "  Presented  to 
Captain  Benjamin  Lester  Peters  by  the  officers,  non-com- 
missioned officers  and  gunners  of  late  No.  2  Battery  New 
Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery  of  St.  John,  New  Brunswick, 
1869."  George  F.  Smith  presided  and  L  Allen  Jack  filled 
the  vice  chair.  An  address  was  read  by  the  latter  to  which 
the  captain  responded,  and  after  which,  in  the  early  morning, 
the  old  battery  fell  into  marching  order  and  escorted  the  cap- 
tain home.     And  thus  the  record  ends.

CHAPTER    XIT. 

1862-1864. 

The  Trent  Afair — Arrival  of  Troops  at  Saint  John — Service  of  the 
Artillery — The  New  Militia  Act — Changes  in  Officers — Prince  of 
Wales'  Cup  Won  by  Gunner  Jones — Boll  of  Portland  Battery. 


TN  the  latter  days  of  1861  there  was  a  change  of  governors 
I  in  New  Brunswick,-  Hon.  Mr.  Manners-Sutton  being 
replaced  by  Hon.  Arthur  Gordon.  The  departing  gover- 
nor received  a  salute  from  the  guns  of  Rankine's  company  on 
the  22nd  October,  and  his  successor  was  received  by  a  full 
militia  display  in  which  the  Rothesay,  Renfrew,  Queen's  Own 
Rifles  and  City  Guards  took  part  on  behalf  of  the  infantry, 
while  HuRD  Peters,  Rankine  and  B.  Lester  Peters'  bat- 
teries fired  a  salute.  At  the  Court  House  the  troops  were 
drawn  up  in  a  square  and  Lieutenant-Colonel  Thurgar  read 
an  address  from  the  volunteers  to  His  Excellency.  The  gover- 
nor was  in  the  uniform  of  a  Scotch  volunteer  company,  having 
been  quite  prominent  in  that  movement  in  Scotland. 

A  despatch  from  Boston  on  the  12th  December  threw  the 
province  into  a  state  of  great  excitement.  It  announced  the 
now  historic  news  of  the  stopping  of  the  British  mail  steamer 
Trent  by  the  U.  S.  S.  San  Jacinto  under  Captain  Wilkes, 
and  the  taking  from  her  of  Mason  and  Seidell,  the  com- 
missioners of  the  Southern  confederacy.  The  Trent  was  on 
her  way  from  Havana  to  St.  Thomas  and  was  stopped  by  force 
on  8th  November,  searched,  and  the  commissioners  seized. 
British    indignation    was    at    the    fever   point.      The  provincial 


Il8  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

sympathy  had  largely  been  with  the  Southerners,  and  this 
made  the  feeling  more  intense.  By.  the  middle  of  December 
a  royal  messenger,  bearing  a  demand  for  the  return  of  the 
commissioners,. reached  Washington.  Troops  were  despatcl\ed 
to  Caaada  as  rapidly  as  they  could  be  got  on  board  the  ships, 
and  by  New  Year's,  1862,  were  landing  at  Halifax  and  St. 
John.  At  that  season  of  the  year  the  St.  Lawrence  was  frozen 
and  the  regiments  had  to  be  sent  to  Upper  Canada  through 
New  Brunswick.  The  new  governor  issued  a  proclamation  on 
28th  December,  requesting  members  of  the  volunteer  companies 
to  offer  their  services  as  a  fatigue  party  available  for  duty  on 
the  arrival  of  H.  M.  troops.  From  fifty  to  eighty  men  were  re- 
quired. His  Excellency  assured  the  volunteers  of  the  impor- 
tance which  would  be  attached  to  this  service  and  thanked 
those  who  had  that  day  been  on  duty  at  the  Barracks.  These 
were  from  the  artillery  under  Captains  Peters  and  Rankine. 
The  same  newspaper  which  contained  the  proclamation  had 
also  a  despatch  stating  that  the  United  States  had  agreed  to 
surrender  Mason  and  Seidell,  and  this,  of  course,  was  an 
assurance  that  peace  would  be  preserved.  In  the  meantime 
the  north  wing  of  the  Custom  House,  the  Temperance  Hall  on 
Sidney  street,  Railway  Car  Shed,  Madras  School,  Varley  School, 
Lower  Cove  Market  House,  new  Police  Office  and  Watch 
House,  Cudlip's  Building,  on  Princess  street,  and  Trinity  Church 
Sunday-school,  were  being  fitted  up  as  sleeping  shelters  for  the 
troops  which  were  daily  expected  by  the  steamers  Cleopatra^ 
Adriatic^  Parana  and  Australasian. 

The  volunteers  readily  assumed  the  work  of  fatigue  duty. 
The  whole  force  was  addressed  on  January  3rd,  in  the  Mechanics' 
Institute,  by  Governor  Gordon,  who  pointed  out  the  necessity 
and  advantage   of  a  well   organized    militia   and    made  a  most 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  II9 

fervent  and  patriotic  appeal  to  the  people.  By  the  loth  Feb- 
ruary the  troops  were  all  en  route  from  St.  John,  having  been 
dined  and  lionized  most  heartily  by  an  enthusiastic  people. 
All  danger  was  over  and  the  ordinary  duties  of  life  were  re- 
sumed by  our  artillerymen  who  had  learned  much  of  practical 
value  by  their  intercourse  with  the  troops  and  their  fatigue 
duty.  All  who  assisted  in  the  debarkation  and  reception  of 
the  troops  were  thanked  by  a  general  order. 

On  February  loth  despite  very  cold  weather  Captain  Pick's 
company  met  at  the  rifle  range,  Gunner  Henry  Boulton  win- 
ning a  medal  offered  by  the  captain. 

In  this  year  Lieutenant-Colonel  Hayne  became  quartermaster- 
general,  his  term  of  office  as  adjutant-general  having  expired, 
and  the  following  general  order  was  issued  under  date  of  ist 
January : — 

"His  Excellency  the  Commander-in-Chief  cannot  permit  Lieu- 
"  tenant-Colonel  Hayne  to  retire  from  the  office  of  adjutant- 
"  general,  which  he  has  so  long  filled,  without  expressing  his 
"  thanks  for  the  zeal  and  assiduity  with  which  he  has  discharged 
"the  onerous  duties  of  that  office.  His  unremitting  attention 
"to  the  welfare  and  discipHne  of  the  militia  calls  for  His  Ex- 
"  cellency's  warmest  approbation,  and  the  sincere  gratitude  of 
"all  those  who  desire  the  efficiency  of  that  force. 

"  His  Excellency  feels  certain  that  Lieutenant-Cfilonel  Hayne 
"will  carry  to  the  discharge  of  the  duties  of  the  responsible 
"  office  he  now  holds,  the  same  zealous  devotedness  and  single- 
"ness  of  purpose  which  he  has  always  shown  as  adjutant- 
"  general." 

A  new  militia  act  was  passed  this  year  which  provided  for 
the  organization  of  a  force  on  principles  which  are  embodied 
in  the  present  Militia  and  Defence  Act  of  Canada.  By  it  the 
male  population  between  eighteen  and  sixty  years  of  age  liable 
to  bear  arms  was  divided  into  two  classes,    the  active  and  the 


120  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

sedentary  militia.  The  latter  was  not  required  to  drill  in  time 
of  peace.  The  active  militia  was  further  divided  into  three 
classes :  class  A,  consisting  of  volunteers ;  class  B,  unmarried 
men  and  widowers  without  children;  class  C,  married  men  and 
widowers  with  children. 

There  were  to  be  drilled  annually  one  thousand  men  for  a 
period  of  six  days,  and  should  that  number  not  be  filled  by 
volunteers  it  was  to  be  made  up  by  a  draft  from  the  next 
class.  Volunteers  could  not  quit  their  companies  without  two 
months'  notice,  and  their  engagement  required  two  years'  ser- 
vice, though,  as  at  present,  under  ordinary  circumstances  a 
discharge  could  always  be  obtained. 

Previous  to  the  passing  of  the  act,  as  has  been  shown  the 
associations  for  drill  were  purely  voluntary,  and  though  they 
had  the  sanction  of  the  law,  yet  were  without  its  compulsion. 
A  system  of  company  internal  government  had  grown  up,  no 
doubt  in  part  adopted  from  the  English  volunteer  model  and 
in  part  an  evolution  of  local  requirements.  To  preserve  this 
spirit  of  self-government  a  number  of  rules  were  collected  and 
published  with  a  view  to  their  adoption,  so  far  as  might  be 
expedient  by  the  organizations  then  to  be  formed.  They  pro- 
vided for  the  classification  of  company  members  into  enrolled 
members,  sub-divided  into  effectives  and  non-effectives,  and 
honorary  members  who  contributed  to  the  funds  of  a  company 
but  were  not  enrolled  for  service.  The  companies  voted  on 
the  admission  of  members  subject  to  the  veto  of  the  command- 
ing officer.  There  was  a  secretary  and  treasurer,  the  captain 
always  acting  as  president.  The  secretary  was  generally  re- 
quired to  call  a  meeting  of  the  company  upon  the  requisition 
of  five  members,  but  the  company  could  not  deal  with  any 
(juestion  of  discipline.      In  recommending  the  appointment   of 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLKRY.  121 

officers  the  commanding  officer  was  to  recommend  as  far  as  pos- 
sible such  persons  as  would  be  agreeable  to  the  company,  but 
the  responsibility  rested  with  him.  This  was  a  departure  from 
the  old  system  of  electing  oflFcers.  It  is  apparent  that  there 
was  much  of  merit  in  such  an  organization,  as  it  recognized 
distinctly  the  social  life  of  the  volunteer  and  combined  it  with 
his  military  services.  No  better  reason  can  be  assigned  for  the 
remarkable  esprit  de  corps  which  characterized  the  provincial 
forces  at  this  period,  and  as  time  runs  on  the  old  idea  seems 
again  to  be  gaining  ground,  so  that  before  many  years  we  may 
again,  in  city  corps  at  least,  have  a  revival  of  the  volunteer 
system  and  the  voluntary  spirit. 

Owing  to  the  legal  change  in  the  status  of  the  militia,  the 
commander-in-chief  directed  circulars  to  be  forwarded  to  all 
militia  bodies,  asking  whether  or  not  they  desired  the  accept- 
ance of  their  services  under  the  new  act.  The  companies 
commanded  by  Captains  Hurd  Peters,  John  McLauchlan, 
B.  Lester  Peters  and  George  H.  Pick  were  accepted  on 
23rd  June,  and  Captain  Adams'  company,  then  under  Lieu- 
tenant Martjn  Hunter  Peters  on  8th  July,  the  latter  officer 
being  promoted  to  a  captaincy  on  nth  July.  Captain  Adams 
remained  unattached  until  1863,  when  he  retired  retaining 
rank.  Captain  and  Adjutant  Mount  was  appointed  enrolling 
officer  for  the  eastern  district  of  St.  John  city.  In  Captain 
McLauch LAN's  company  Lieutenant  Knight  retired,  being 
succeeded  by  Second  Lieutenant  McLachlan,  and  Sergeant 
McCordock  was  promoted  to  the  vacancy.  In  October  Cap- 
tain Travis  was  transferred  to  the  Queen's  Co.  militia  infan- 
try, and  promotions  were  made  in  his  artillery  company,  the 
services  of  which,  under  Captain  F.  L.  Knox,  were  accepted 
in    December.      At    the    same    time    a    Fredericton    company, 


122  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

under  Captain  E.  W.  Chestnut,  was  enrolled.  In  the  previous 
month  the  company  at  St.  John  under  Lieutenant  Deacon 
was  accepted,  Samuel  R.  Thomson  having  become  captain. 
This  gentleman  was  one  of  the  most  celebrated  members  of 
the  New  Brunswick  bar,  and  was  induced  to  command  the 
company  for  his  social  prestige  and  influence.  Lieutenant 
Deacon  remained  in  the  service. 

Owing  to  the  recent  death,  1861,  of  the  Prince  Consort, 
Her  Majesty  directed  that  there  should  be  no  public  obser- 
vation of  her  birthday,  so  by  proclamation  the  20th  June  was 
substituted  as  a  public  holiday. 

Six  batteries,  under  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster,  were  in- 
spected on  24th  October  by  the  Lieutenant-Governor,  Colonel 
Cole,  15th  Regiment,  and  Captain  Smyth,  R.  A.  They  were 
those  of  Captains  Pick,  Hurd  Peters,  McLauchlan,  B.  Les- 
ter Peters,  M.  H.  Peters,  and  Thomson  (then  commanded 
by  Lieutenant  Deacon).  Those  of  Captain  Pick  and  B.  L. 
Peters  were  very  highly  commended  in  the  report  which  states 
that  the  gun  drill  of  the  regiment  was  good,  though  company 
movements  were  deficient.  Some  members  of  almost  every 
battery  were  not  in  uniform.  By  general  order  the  pattern  of 
artillery  uniform  previously  in  use  was  retained.  Dress  regu- 
lations, in  detail,  were  issued  in  the  following  year. 

During  1862  Governor  Gordon  visited  many  parts  of  the 
province  and  received  numerous  addresses.  Volunteers  of  the 
present  day  may  take  warning  from  the  experience  of  the  com- 
panies at  Richibucto,  who  followed  the  prevailing  custom  and 
tendered  the  governor  a  parchment  scroll  of  eulogistic  charac- 
ter. He  told  them  that  as  this  was  their  first  offence  he  would 
overlook  it  and  accept  the  address,  but  warned  them  and  all 
other  militia  men   not   to    pursue   the    custom.      The    right  to 


N.    P.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 23 

praise,  he  said,  implied  the  right  to  blame,  and  as  discipline 
forbade  the  censure  of  an  officer  by  those  under  his  command, 
the  right  to  praise  was  impliedly  taken  away.  It  must  be  re- 
membered that  the  Lieutenant-Governor  was,  in  those  days, 
Commander-in-Chief  of  the  militia. 

It  does  not  seem  clear  that  the  Woodstock  company  en- 
rolled under  the  new  act,  but  the  commissions  of  the  officers 
remained  in  force  and  promotions  at  a  later  date  were  founded 
upon  them.  Captain  A.  K.  S.  WetmorE  retired  with  the  rank 
of  major  after  long  and  useful  service. 

In  the  rifle  competitions  of  this  year  Gunner  Edward  Jones, 
of  Captain  B.  Lester  Peters'  company  won  the  Prince  of 
Wales  cup.  Gunner  W.  Morgan,  of  Captain  Hurd  Peters' 
and  Gunner  J.  L.  Bunting  of  Captain  B.  Lester  Peters*, 
each  won  government  silver  medals.  Gunner  Jones  was  a  son 
of  the  sheriff  of  Charlotte  county.  On  the  return  of  the  winner 
from  Fredericton  he  was  royally  received  at  Indiantown  by  the 
battery  and  with  Captain  Peters  driven  in  a  barouche  to  his 
home. 

March  loth,  1863,  the  day  of  the  wedding  of  the  Prince  of 
Wales,  was  observed  by  salutes  fired  by  Captain  Pick's  battery 
from  King  Square  ;  Captain  Thomson's,  from  Queen  Square ; 
Captain  B.  L.  Peters,'  Reed's  Point ;  Captain  M.  H.  Peters,' 
flagstaff,  Brooks  Ward,  Carleton ;  Captain  McLauchlan's,  flag- 
staff, Guys  Ward,  Carleton ;  Captain  Hurd  Peters,'  Fort  Howe. 
The  usual  salutes  were  fired  on  the  Queen's  birthday,  and  on 
24th  June,  Captain  M.  H.  Peters'  battery  fired  a  salute  at 
the  laying  of  the  corner  stone  of  Carleton  City  Hall. 

The  Prince  of  Wales  cup  did  not  come  to  the  artillery  in 
this  year,  but  Gunner  Jones  won  the  second  prize,  a  gold 
watch,     while    in    a    local    competion    Gunner    Bunting,     of 


124 


HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 


B.  L.  Peters',  and  G.  J.  Coster,  of  Captain  McLauchlan's 
battery,  each  won  a  silver  medal.  There  was  a  grand  review 
at  Torryburn  on  25th  September  at  which  the  artillery  and  all 
Other  forces  acquitted  themselves  creditably  They  were  ac- 
companied on  this  occasion  by  Captain  Morris'  battery  of 
Royal  Artillery. 

There  was  not  the  same  ecla.  attending  the  reviews  of  that 
portion  of  the  active  militia  which  was  not  enrolled  in  the 
volunteer  companies.  By  an  absurd  provision  in  the  law  they 
were  called  out  for  one  day's  drill  in  each  year.  Of  course 
they  formed  the  butt  for  all  who  chose  to  jeer,  and  the  des- 
criptions in  the  newspapers  of  the  time  are  most  ludicrous. 
No  training  was  given  or  could  be  attempted  and  these  farces 
served  simply  for  the  enrolment  of  the  men. 

During  the  year  Captain  Hurd  Peters  retired  from  the 
command  of  the  Portland  battery,  which  he  had  brought  into 
existence  and  which  had  been  very  successful  under  his  charge. 
He  was  succeeded  in  command  by  Lieutenant  Simonds, 
who  had  been  gazetted  27th  April.  Lieutenants  Kirk  and 
Rankin  also  retired  and  Gunner  Edward  Jones,  of  B.  L. 
Peters'  battery  and  Richard  Farmer  obtained  commissions 
in  the  battery. 

Captain  Knox's  battery  at  Gagetown  went  out  of  service. 
Captain  Chestnut's  at  Fredericton  was  strengthened  by  the 
appointment  of  Geo.  C.  Peters  and  John  M.  Stratton  as 
lieutenants.  The  latter  was  drowned  in  the  Saxby  gale  of 
1869.  Lieutenant  Quinton  was  also  transferred  from  Captain 
M.  H.  Peters'  battery  to  the  county  militia. 

The  remarks  of  Lieutenant  Jago,  R.  A.,  who  inspected  the 
artillery  at  St.  John  on  September  loth,  were  very  complimen- 
tary.     Without   underrating   the  other  batteries    he  particularly 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 25 

commended  B.  Lester  Peters'  battery  both  for  their  smart 
and  soldier-like  appearance  on  parade,  and  also  for  their  general 
efficieacy  in  their  duties. 

The  first  militia  order  of  1864  appointed  Captain  B.  Lester 
Peters  provincial  aid-de-camp  vice  Lieutenant-Colonel  Hayne, 
resigned.  The  following  extract  from  the  minutes  of  that  officer's 
battery  at  a  meeting  held   nth  January  is  interesting: 

"On  motion  of  Gunner  Jack,  seconded  by  Sergeant  Geo. 
"  Foster,  Corporal  Chamberlain  was  called  to  the  chair,  who 
"  conveyed  to  Captain  B.  Lester  Peters  the  congratulations 
"  of  the  battery  on  occasion  of  His  Excellency  the  Commander- 
"  in-Chief  having  been  pleased  to  appoint  him  to  be  provincial 
"aid-de-camp   vice  Lieutenant-Colonel  R.    Hayne,  resigned. 

"  The  Captain  then  thanked  the  battery  for  their  congratu- 
"lations,  stating  among  other  things  'that  his  duties  as  provincial 
"aid-de-camp  would  not  interfere  with  his  position  as  their 
"captain.'  This  announcement  was  received  with  reiterated 
"cheering." 

Let  the  minutes  of  i8th  April  tell  of  another  promotion  : 

"Captain  announced  that  Sergeant-Major  Lockhart  had 
"been  appointed  quartermaster  of  the  New  Brunswick  Regi- 
"ment  of  Artillery.  Captain  promoted  Sergeant  Inches  to  be 
"  sergeant-major  of  the  battery.  Corporal  Foster  to  be  sergeant, 
"  and  Bombardier  Perley  to  be  corporal.  On  motion  of 
"  Sergeant-Major  Inches,  seconded  by  .Gunner  Vroom, — It  was 
"resolved  that  while  this  battery  have  heard  with  pleasure  of 
"the  promotion  of  their  former  sergeant-major,  W.  Albert 
"Lockhart,  to  the  post  of  quartermaster  of  tHe  regiment,  they 
"regret  the  loss  of  his  immediate  connection  with  the  battery. 
"  His  long  association  with  it,  dating  from  its  first  formation, 
"the  interest  which  he  has  always  shown  in  its  affairs  and  the 
"volunteer  movement  generally,  as  well  as  the  high  qualities 
"as  a  companion  and  associate  which  he  has  shown  have 
"gained  him  their  esteem  and  respect,  and  they  therefore  here- 
"  by  unanimously  elect  him  an  honorary  member  of  this 
"battery." 


126  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

The  new  sergeant-major  is  now  Dr.  P.  R.  Inches  of  Saint 
John,  and  W.  A.  Lockhart  was  from  1889  to  1891  mayor  of 
that  city.  Dr.  Inches'  brother,  Keir  Inches,  was  in  1838  a 
member  of  Captain,  now  Sir  John  C.  Allen's  company  at 
Fredericton,  and  was  drowned  on  19th  July  of  that  year  while 
on  duty.      The    regiment    erected  a  tombstone  to  his  memory. 

In  1864  Captain  John  McLauchlan  was  succeeded  by 
Thomas  M.  McLachlan  ;  Captain  E.  W.  Chestnut  and 
John  Simonds  also  retired.  The  Portland  battery's  officers  be- 
came, captain,  Richard  Farmer;  lieutenant,  Wm.  Cunard,  and 
second  lieutenant,  George  Garby.  Second  Lieutenant  F.  G. 
W.  Lansdowne  of  Captain  B.  L.  Peters'  battery  was  given 
the  rank  of  first  lieutenant,  practically  a  brevet  rank.  Jacob 
D.  Underhill  was  appointed  second  lieutenant  in  Captain 
Pick's  battery,  and  Lieutenants  Shannon  and  Taylor  retired. 
Christopher  Murray  came  into  Captain  S.  R.  Thomson's 
battery  as  first  lieutenant,  and  Roger  Hunter  was  promoted 
to  the  same  rank.  W.  W.  Street  was  also  appointed  second 
lieutenant. 

Captain  Pick's  battery  exhibited  a  great  deal  of  social  ac- 
tivity during  the  year.  In  February  they  had  a  '  tea  soiree  ' 
in  Smith's  building,  which  was  apparently  a  very  enjoyable 
affair,  and  in  November  held  an  assembly  in  Ritchie's  building, 
an  event  which  seems  to  have  given  a  great  deal  of  pleasure. 

The  Portland  battery  held  a  ball  in  the  old  Temperance 
Hall  on  25th  February.  The  advertisement  shows  the  com- 
mittee to  have  been  Edward  Jones,  Richard  Farmer, 
Thomas  Scott,  Wm.  McKenzie,  Geo.  Kennedy,  P.  M. 
Parkinson,  Wm.  Barron,  Wm.  Ewing,  Thos.  Clark,  John 
Lord,  James  .  McConnell,  Matthew  Mitchell,  Geo.  Carr, 
James  McIntyre.     Wm.  Cathcart  was  secretary.

On  the  visit  of  the  delegates  from  Upper  Canada,  who  were 
viewing  the  land  previous  to  confederation,  a  salute  was  fired 
at  Fredericton  by  Captain  Berton's  battery.  In  August 
Lieutenant-Colonel  Crowder,  adjutant-general,  resigned  and 
was  succeeded  by  Colonel  Thomas  Anderson,  of  St.  John 
Volunteer  Battalion,  who  was  formerly  a  captain  in  the  78th 
Highlanders. 

The  artillery  of  St.  John  to  the  number  of  one  hundred  and 
fifty,  under  Captains  Pick,  B.  L.  Peters,  McLachlan  and 
Farmer,  were  reviewed   on    September   22nd,  at   King  square,

by  the  new  adjutant-general  who  presented  to  Gunner  Bunting 
the  medal  for  rifle  shooting  which  he  had  won  in   1863. 

In  general  orders  of  12th  October  His  Excellency  thanked 
Captain  Saunders,  of  Hampton  Troop  of  Cavalry,  Lieutenant 
Murray,  of  N.  B.  R.  A.,  and  Captain  Beer,  Kings  County 
Militia,  for  the  tenders  of  service  of  their  respective  commands 
for  camp  duty  during  the  annual  rifle  competition,  which  had 
been  accepted.  He  also  congratulated  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Foster  on  having  under  his  command  a  battery  so  admirable 
in  drill  and  discipline  as  that  of  Captain  Picks,  and  regretted 
that  circumstances  did  not  permit  his  acceptance  of  the  offer 
of  Captain  Farmer  to  bring  his  men  to  camp  for  duty  at  their 
own  expense.

CHAPTER     XIII. 

I865-I868. 

Utimors  of  a  Fenian  Invasion — A  Bun  on  the  Savings  Bank — Meas- 
ures for  Defence — Artillery  Under  Arms — An  Alarm — '  Court 
Martialed  and  Shot' — Thanks  from  the  Governor — Confederation 
— End  of  the  Colville  Company. 


QFEW  changes  of  subordinate  officers  occurred  in  1865, 
which  are  noted  in  the  appendix  of  battery  succession 
lists,  and  one  battery,  that  of  Captain  McLachlan, 
Carleton,  was  disbanded  for  non-attendance  at  drill.  In  this 
year  Lieutenant-Colonel  Hayne,  who  had  since  1838  had  the 
title  of  command,  though  the  more  active  duties  were  performed 
by  Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster,  was  promoted  to  the 
rank  of  colonel  commandant,  and  Stephen  Kent  Foster  at- 
tained to  the  subtantive  rank  of  lieutenant-colonel.  In  this 
year,  too.  Captain  George  J.  Maunsell,  15th  Regiment,  be- 
came adjutant-general  of  the  province,  a  gentleman  who  for 
nearly  a  third  of  a  century  has  been  in  close  connection  with 
our  forces,  and  whose  soldierly  qualities  combined  with  affability 
and  kindness  have  endeared  him  to  all  who  have  sought  his 
counsel  or  obeyed  his  commands.  Besides  an  inspection  of 
Captain  Pick's  battery  in  January  by  Major  Melick,  the  holding 
of  some  quadrille  assemblies  by  the  men,  at  one  of  which 
Gunner  William  McAfee  was  presented  with  a  medal  won 
for  rifle  shooting,  and  the  usual  24th  of  May  salute,  there  is 
nothing  of  local  incident  to  chronicle  in  this  year.  The  whole 
regiment  was  ordered    into    camp    in  July  at  Fredericton,    and 


130  HISTORICAL    RFXORDS    OF    THE 

though  the  report  is  satisfactory  no  details  are  given.  St.  John 
was  visited  in  May  by  General  Sir  F.  Williams,  the  hero  of 
Kars,  who,  on  his  departure,  received  a  farewell  salute  from 
B.  Lester  Peters'   battery. 

The  year  1866  was  destined  to  try  the  mettle  of  the  volun- 
teer force  throughout  Canada.  For  some  months  rumors  of  a 
Fenian  rising  had  been  current,  and  as  this  year  approached 
they  seemed  to  take  more  definite  shape.  The  first  two  months, 
however,  were  quiet  enough.  Under  the  new  militia  act  of 
1865  Captain  Thomson's  battery  was  once  more  re-organized, 
Lieutenant  Christopher  Murray  becoming  captain,  with  Ser- 
geant Stephen  Kent  Foster,  jr.,  as  lieutenant.  At  Saint 
Andrews,  where  the  artillery  had  died  out,  a  new  battery  was 
formed  in  January  under 

Captain^  Henry  Osburn, 

Lieutenant^  Thos.  T.  Odell, 

Second  Lieutenant,  Walter  B.  Morris. 

This  battery  performed  some  interesting  service  a  few  months 
later.  John  R.  Smith,  of  Captain  B.  L.  Peters'  battery,  ob- 
tained a  commission  as  second  lieutenant  in  Captain  Pick's 
battery,  which  he  resigned  later  in  the  year.  Early  "in  March 
newspaper  items  that  the  bonds  of  '  The  Irish  Republic '  were 
being  offered  for  sale  in  New  York  and  other  cities  of  the 
United  States  began  to  excite  alarm.  Agitators  known  as 
*  Head  Centres '  addressed  largely  attended  meetings  across  the 
border,  and  the  feeling  grew  that  the  descent  of  the  troops 
which  they  were  gathering  would  be  upon  the  coast  of  New 
Brunswick.  Popular  imagination  fixed  the  probable  date  for 
invasion  as  St.  Patrick's  day,  and  so  great  was  the  excitement 
that  there  was  a  run  on  the  Savings  Bank  at  St.  John.  Cir- 
culars,  purporting  to  come  from  a  republican  committee  in  the 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  I3I 

city,  were  twice  secretly  distributed  about  the  streets,  calling 
on  the  citizens  to  rise,  and  assuring  them  that  these  'republi- 
cans' had  the  sympathy  of  the  Fenians  and  a  part  of  the 
militia.  The  British  and  local  governments  made  preparation 
and  the  drill  rooms  were  closed  to  all  but  volunteers.  On  the 
loth  March  in  the  House  of  Assembly  Mr.  Wilmot  asked  the 
attorney-general  if  the  government  intended  sending  volunteers 
to  Campobello,  intelligence  having  been  received  that  a  Fenian 
demonstration  was  expected  in  that  quarter.  No  information 
was  vouchsafed  except  that  the  government  was  adopting  ener- 
getic measures  for  the  safety  of  the  country.  In  a  few  days 
despatches  from  New  York  stated  that  the  organization  was 
formed  under  experienced  officers  and  that  15,000  uniforms 
and  2,000  rifles  were  stored  in  Burlington,  Vt. 

The  measures  for  defence  began  by  the  appointment  of  Cap- 
tain Thomas  Anderson,  late  H.  M.  78th,  as  colonel  in 
charge  of  the  western  military  district  of  New  Brunswick,  and 
Lieutenant  Darrell  R.  J  ago,  R.  A.,  was  appointed  captain 
and  assistant  adjutant-general  of  artillery.  On  14th  March  one 
captain,  one  first  and  one  second  lieutenant  with  eighty-three 
men  of  the  N.  B.  R.  A.  were  called  out  for  actual  service, 
together  with  the  St.  John  Volunteer  Battalion.  The  whole 
force  was  placed  under  command  of  Brevet  Colonel  John 
Amber  Cole,  H.  M.  15th  Regiment.  The  artillery  called 
out  were  Captain  Pick's  battery  with  Lieutenant  S.  K.  Fos- 
ter, jr.,  and  Lieutenant  Geo.  Garby,  of  Portland  battery. 
They  were  stationed  on  Partridge  Island  at  the  entrance  to  St. 
John  harbor,  and  also  at  Reed's  Point.  On  4th  April  Captain 
M.  H.  Peters,  with  Lieutenant  E.  J.  Wetmore  and  twenty 
men,  were  called  out  and  stationed  at  the  Martello  Tower, 
Negrotown    Point    battery    (now    Fort    Dufferin),   and   at  Sand 


132  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

Cove,  near  St.  John.  Captain  Osburn,  with  one  Ueutenant 
and  twenty  men,  was  also  placed  on  duty  at  St.  Andrews. 
Major  CuTHBERT  Willis  was  made  commandant  at  the  latter 
place.  Ensign  Nicholas  T.  Greathead  was  transferred  from 
Charlotte  County  militia  to  Captain  Osburn's  battery  and  went 
on  duty  at  St.  Andrews.  The  St.  John  Volunteer  Battalion 
was  despatched  to  St.  Andrews  and  served  on  the  frontier 
with  Captain  Osburn's  battery. 

At  Carleton,  St.  John,  the  old  roof  was  removed  from  the 
Martello  Tower  and  guns  were  mounted.  Earthworks  were 
thrown  up  on  the  adjacent  hill  and  guns  mounted  at  Fort 
Dufferin.  On  April  nth  there  was  a  rumor  in  the  city  that 
two  hundred  armed  men  had  endeavored  to  take  passage  on 
the  American  boat  at  Portland  for  Eastport,  but  had  been  re- 
fused unless  they  left  their  arms  behind  them.  Captain  Hood, 
of  H.  M.  S.  Pylades^  telegraphed  recommending  a  call  of  the 
volunteers.  The  St.  John  men  had  patrols  out,  that  of  the 
Carleton  battery  extending  down  the  coast  to  Sand  Cove.  A 
system  of  signals  was  arranged  by  Major  Jago,  and  Captain 
Pick  directed  to  have  one  sentry  at  the  battery  on  Partridge 
Island  and  such  others  at  look-out  points  as  might  be  needed. 
An  attempt  at  landing  was  to  be  announced  by  two  guns,  and 
very  suspicious  circumstances  at  night  by  three  rockets  at  three 
minute  intervals.  Rockets  sent  up  from  Sand  Cove  were  to 
be  repeated  at  the  Island,  Lower  Cove  and  at  Carleton,  Two 
guns  at  any  one  of  the  latter  places  were  to  be  repeated  by 
the  others.  Captain  M.  H.  Peters'  force  was  increased  to 
forty  men,  and  afterwards  four  were  taken  from  Captain  Pick's 
and  added  to  his. 

On  April  15th  there  was  a  landing  at  Indian  Island,  a  small 
island  near  Campobello.     The  house  of  the  collector  of  customs, 


N.    U.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 33 

Dixon,  was  visited  and  the  British  flag  seized.  It  was  found 
a  few  days  afterwards,  and  there  has  always  been  some  doubt 
as  to  the  real  character  of  the  persons  who  committed  the 
depredation.  But  the  province  was  in  a  blaze.  There  was 
another  landing  later  on  at  the  same  place  when  the  boat  was 
challenged  by  an  outpost  under  command  of  Lieutenant  John 
B.  WiLMOT,  of  the  St.  John  Volunteer  Battalion.  Receiving 
no  reply  they  fired,  and  the  party  left  hurriedly.  A  few  nights 
after,  at  a  late  hour,  H.  M.  S.  Cordelia  in  the  harbor  of  St. 
Andrews  beat  to  quarters  and  despatched  rockets.  Captain 
Osburn's  battery  fired  from  the  guns  of  Fort  Tipperary  and 
the  whole  force  turned  out.  It  was  only  a  'scare'  to  test  the 
efficiency  of  the  men  but  it  worked  well.  Nothing  more  serious 
occurred,  and  the  Fenians  after  a  repulse  at  Niagara  disbanded. 
During  the  excitement  General  Meade  and  staff,  of  the  U.  S. 
A.,  was  stationed  at  Calais,  on  the  frontier,  with  sixty-five  men 
of  the  ist  U.  S.  Heavy  Artillery.  Generals  Meade  and  Doyle 
exchanged  civilities  and  took  precautions  for  the  safety  of  the 
province. 

S.  Kent  Foster,  jr.,  then  lieutenant  of  Murray's  battery, 
says  that  part  of  Captain  Pick's  force  were  from  that  battery. 
The  only  uniform  most  of  them  had  was  a  great-coat.  The 
men,  except  those  on  the  island,  went  home  at  night  and  did 
about  five  hours  work  per  day  mostly  garrison  gun  drill  in 
which  they  became  very  proficient.  Of  course  the  other  forces 
kept  up  sentries  by  night  at  their  outposts.  During  the  service 
Captain  Pick  reported  two  men.  Gunners  James  Devereaux 
and  Benjamin  Logax,  for  having  deserted  their  posts  while  on 
duty,  and  asked  if  there  should  be  a  court  martial.  Lieutenant 
Foster  says  that  the  men  went  into  a  shed  and  played  a  game 
of  cards.     The  official  correspondence  does  not  go  so  far,  simply 


134  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

Stating  that  they  were  in  a  shed  a  short  distance,  not  more 
than  one  hundred  yards,  beyond  their  beats,  and  that  they 
stopped  in  there  to  hght  their  pipes.  Smoking  on  the  beat 
was  of  course  forbidden,  and  when  the  news  got  about  it  was 
currently  repoited  that  the  men  would  be  shot!  The  affair 
ended  by  Major  Jago,  who  heartily  wished  that  his  attention 
had  never  been  called  to  the  occurrence,  delivering  an  impres- 
sive caution.  In  a  letter  on  the  subject  he  says,  '  My  own 
'idea  of  volunteers  is  that  you  ought  not  to  look  too  closely 
'into  their  way  of  doing  the  work  as  long  as  it  is  done.'  The 
exercise  of  such  good  common  sense  got  over  a  difficulty  which 
might  have  been  very  serious  if  formalities  had  been  observed 
and  affords  a  practical  suggestion    on  the  subject  of  discipline. 

The  whole  force,  consisting  of  Captain  Pick  with  Lieutenant 
Garby  and  forty-six  men,  Captain  M.  H.  Peters  with  Lieutenant 
Wetmore  and  forty-four  men,  and  Lieutenant  Foster  with 
thirty  men,  was  paid  off  on  the  2nd  June  and  the  bloodless 
campaign  was  at  an  end.  Three  additional  batteries  had  been 
formed  as  a  result  of  the  scare,  that  under  Captain  Osburn 
at  St.  Andrews,  already  mentioned;  one  under  Captain  Edgar 
at  Woodstock,  and  a  third  under  Captain  Wm.  T.  Rose  at 
St.  Stephen.  Captain  Rose  had  years  before  been  in  command 
of  a  battery  which  was  now  reorganized  for  service.  He  re- 
tired as  major  and  was  succeeded  by  Captain  W.  T.  Clewley. 

Under  these  circumstances  it  may  be  imagined  that  the  cele- 
bration of  the  Queen's  birthday  was  more  than  an  ordinary 
affair.  At  St.  Andrews  a  dinner  was  given  by  Captain  Steven- 
son and  the  officers  of  the  '  Gordon  Rifles,'  at  which  St.  John 
officers  were  guests.  On  behalf  of  the  St.  Andrews  battery, 
in  response  to  that  toast.  Lieutenant  Greathead  is  reported  as 
returning  thanks.  The  whole  force  was  inspected  and  the  day 
was  a  great  one  for  St.  Andrews.

As  B,  Lester  Peters'  battery  was  largely  composed  of  clerks 
in  banks  and  other  institutions  it  was  impossible  for  them  to 
go  into  service  which  would  interfere  with  the  discharge  of  their 
duties  unless  in  case  of  such  emergency  as  the  actual  commence- 
ment of  hostilities.  They,  however,  volunteered  to  a  man  to 
put  in  four  hours  drill  daily  at  the  garrison  guns,  and  did  so 
during  the  whole  time  that  the  force  was  under  arms.  This 
service  was  spontaneous  and  gratuitous  and  received  the  warm- 
est thanks  of  His  Excellency.  During  the  winter,  too,  lectures 
were  delivered  by  Hon.  John  Boyd,  Rev.  G.  W.  M.  Carey, 
Geo.  E.  Fenety  and  Hon.  Wm.  Wedderburn,  the  proceeds 
being  in  aid  of  uniforming  Murray's  battery.  Upon  the  dis- 
bandment  of  the  forces  a  general  order  was  issued  dated  20th 
June,  from  which  the  following   extracts  are  made  : — 

'  His  Excellency  desires  in  a  special  manner  to  acknowledge 

*  the  services  rendered  by  the  batteries  and  detachments  of  the 
'  New  Brunswick  Regiment  of  Artillery.  The  officers  and  men 
'  of  this  branch  of  the  militia  force  have  shown  a  remarkable 
'aptitude  for  acquiring  a  knowledge  of  their  more  difficult 
'duties,  which  has  called  forth  the  marked  commendation  of 
'the  Major-General  commanding  in  the  Lower  Provinces,  and 
'  His  Excellency  has  received  the  most  satisfactory  reports  as 
'to  their  general  good  conduct  and  efficiency.'  *  ^  *  * 
'To  the  forces  generally  employed  on  the  frontier  His  Excel- 
'  lency  desires  to  express  the  gratification  he  has  experienced 
'  in  finding  the  officers,  non-commissioned  officers  and  men 
'composing  the  force  engaged  in  protecting  those  points  of 
'  the  frontier  most  threatened  by  attack,  deserving  of  his  entire 
'confidence.  His  Excellency  is  fully  aware  that  upon  them 
'devolved  duties  of  a  peculiarly  difficult  nature,  the  discharge 
'  of  which  was  occasionally  attended  with  a  greater  degee  of 
'hardship  than  His  Excellency  had  anticipated  or  desired,  but 

*  which  have  been  accomplished  to  His  Excellency's  full  satis- 
'  faction.' 

*  Had  it  been  the  fortune    of  the    militia   volunteers  of  this 


136  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

'province,  as  it  was  of  those  in  Canada,  to  meet  in  conflict 
'  the  armed  invaders  of  our  soil,  His  Excellency  is  certain  that 
'their  conduct  would  have  been  such  as  to  merit  yet  warmer 
'  commendation  ;  and  they  may  take  a  pride  in  reflecting  that 
'  the  attitude  assumed  by  the  local  force  was  among  the  causes 
'  which  frustrated  the  projected  invasion  of  this  province.' 

During  the  year  Surgeon  LeB.  Botsford,  M.  D.,  retired 
with  the  rank  of  major,  and  was  succeeded  by  John  Berry- 
man,  M.  D.,  with  Dr.  Joseph  L.  Bunting  assistant  surgeon. 
Captain  B.  Lester  Peters  received  the  brevet  rank  of  lieu- 
tenant-colonel;  Lieutenant  Inches  that  of  captain,  and  Ser- 
geant James  F.  Robertson  obtained  a  lieutenant's  commission. 

Captain  Pick  became  a  major  by  brevet  and  James  Mc- 
NiCHOL,  jr.,  was  appointed  a  lieutenant  in  Pick's  battery. 

In  1867  there  were  many  promotions  and  brevet  rank  was 
liberally  granted.  The  raising  of  a  new  battery  at  Chatham, 
which  had  been  undertaken  in  the  previous  year,  was  com- 
pleted and  the  following  officers  gazetted  : 

Captain^  Thomas  F.  Gillespie, 

First  Lieutenant^     Francis  J.  Letson, 
Second  Lieutenant,  John  F.  Gemmill. 

Major  Berton's  battery  at  Fredericton  having  become  non- 
effective was  struck  off  the  list.  Major  Berton  had  been 
regimental  major  since  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster's  promotion 
He  now  retired  and  was  succeeded  by  Major  Mount  on  19th 
June,  1867.  Lieutenant  S.  K.  Foster,  of  Murray's  battery, 
became  paymaster  on  the  same  day  vice  Captain  Wiggins,  who 
retired  with  the  rank  of  major.  As  Major  Mount  had  vacated 
the  adjutancy  he  was  succeeded  by  Captain  Jacob  D.  Under- 
bill on  17th  July.  Captain  Edward  H.  Clarke  replaced 
Captain  Clewley  in  command  of  the  battery  at  St.  Stephen 
on  15th  July  of  the  following  year.  The  minor  promotions 
are  all  noted  in  the  appendix. 


N.    15.    GARRISON    ARTILLKRY.  1 37 

The  day  appointed  for  the  confederation  of  the  provinces, 
July  I  St,  1867,  ushering  into  Hfe  the  Dominion  of  Canada, 
was  duly  celebrated  by  our  artillery  corps.  At  noon  royal 
salutes  were  fired  from  King  Square  by  Captain  Murray's 
battery,  and  from  Fort  Howe  by  Captain  Farmer's.  Cap- 
tain B.  L.  Peters'  battery  was  at  the  guns  at  Reed's 
Point  to  salute  also,  but  only  two  guns  were  fired  owing  to  a 
mistake  in  making  up  the  cartridges,  which  were  for  6-pr.  in- 
stead of  3-pr.  guns. 

Under  the  new  regime  militia  and  defence  were  subjects 
placed  under  the  exclusive  control  of  the  Federal  government, 
and  the  provincial  force  was  drilled  in  1868  under  regu- 
lations from  Ottawa  prior  to  another  re-organization.  Dominion 
Day  was  celebrated  this  year  by  three  salutes  fired  at  6,  8, 
and  9  a.  m.  by  Pick's  and  Farmer's  batteries  from  King 
Square  and  Fort  Howe.  On  the  swearing  in  of  Hon.  L. 
A.  WiLMOT  as  Lieutenant-Governor  of  the  province,  July  23, 
three  salutes  of  thirteen  guns  each  were  fired  from  Fort 
Howe  by  Captain  Farmer's  battery.  On  loth  September  the 
regiment  assembled  for  eight  days  drill,  and  on  the  i6th  range 
practice  was  commenced  with  32-pr.  S.  B.  guns  at  the  barracks. 
The  target,  a  flour  barrel,  was  twice  carried  away,  once  by  Mr. 
John  Kerr  of  the  'new  battery  recently  organized,'  and  the 
second  time  by  Sergeant  Frodsham  of  Major  M.  H.  Peters' 
battery. 

In  October  of  this  year  notification  was  received  that  provis- 
ion had  been  made  for  a  class  in  gunnery  at  the  school  at 
Montreal.  Companies  were  required  to  enrol  in  compliance 
with  the  new  law.  The  year  closed  with  the  ninth  anniversary 
of  Portland  battery  which  was  celebrated  by  a  ball  and  supper 
in    the    Temperance    Hall,    on    December    23rd.     Lieutenant- 


138  HISTORICAL    Rf:CORDS    OF    THE 

Colonel  Foster  presented  a  gold  medal  to  Sergeant  Napier 
which  he  had  won  in  the  September  competition. 

This  year,  the  last  of  the  provincial  organization,  unfortu- 
nately brings  to  an  end  the  historical  continuity  of  the  Col- 
V'Ille  company.  Though  by  a  very  slender  thread  at  times, 
yet  still  by  one  that  holds,  succession  can  be  traced  to  Captain 
Murray,  but  on  20th  March,  1868,  a  militia  order  states  that 
this  battery  having  completed  the  term  of  engagement  its  ser- 
vices are  dispensed  with.  It  is  probably  better  to  withold  the 
reasons  which  led  to  this  step  as  they  involve  the  charge  of 
extremely  disrespectful  conduct  by  the  captain  of  the  bat- 
tery to  Major  Jago.  There  was  no  lack  of  efficiency  on  the 
part  of  the  battery,  however,  and  by  July  14th  of  the  same 
year  there  was  a  correspondence  between  Major  Jago  and  the 
D.  A.  G.  as  to  the  appointment  of  Sergeant-Major  John  Kerr 
of  Captain  Pick's  battery  as  lieutenant  of  a  new  company 
which  was  composed  of  a  number  of  Captain  Murray's  men 
together  with  recruits.  Even  before  this  Sergeant-Major  Kerr 
had  been  acting  as  lieutenant.  Drill  for  this  year  was  author- 
ized though  not  by  orders '  in  the  '  Gazette '  as  the  Dominion 
government  pending  the  enactment  of  a  militia  law  dealt  only 
with  corps  and  companies  in  existence.  Acting  Lieutenant 
Kerr's  battery  was  so  treated  and  the  question  of  practical 
succession  to  the  Colville  company  becomes  an  open  one 
for  the  reader.  From  1865  Lieutenant  Colonel  WetiMORE  of 
the  2nd  battalion  Charlotte  County  militia  had  maintained  Cap- 
tain James  Bolton's  company  at  St.  George  as  artillery.  It  was 
not  in  the  regiment  but  was  attached  to  the  battalion  for  ad- 
ministrative purposes. 

At  the  close  of  the  provincial  administration,  then,  there 
were  at  St.  John  five  batteries  under  Brevet  Major  Pick,  Brevet 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLKRY.  1 39 

Major  M    H.  Pkters,   Brevet   Major    Farmer,  acting  Lieuten- 
ant Kerr,  and  Brevet    Lieutenant-Colonel  B.  Lester  Peters. 

At  Woodstock  :  -  -  Captain  Edgar's  battery. 

At  St.  Stephen :  -  -  Captain  Clarke's  battery. 

At  St.  Andrews :  -  -  Captain  Osburn's  battery. 

At  Chatham :  -  -  Captain  Gillespie's  battery. 

At  St.  George :  -  -  Captain  Bolton's  company. 

The  latter  was  not  in  the  regiment. 

And  thus  we  leave  the  old  '  N.  B.  R.  A.'  which  had  been 
in  existence  for  thirty  years  and  in  whose  ranks  had  been 
found  some  of  the  foremost  men  of  the  province.  While  we 
must  all  be  glad  that  a  new  era  of  activity  had  opened  before 
the  old  organization,  yet  the  change  must  cause  deep  and  last- 
ing regret  to  all  who  care  for  the  preservation  of  our  regiments' 
story.  For  by  an  act  of  wanton  vandalism  almost  every  paper 
was  destroyed  which  belonged  to  the  records  of  the  New 
Brunswick  militia,  and  was  not  required  to  be  transmitted  to 
headquarters  at  Ottawa  in  connection  with  current  business. 
Thus  valuable  material  for  accurate  compilation  is  in  many 
cases  wanting,  and  this  generation  must  depend  upon  the  frag- 
mentary details  which  in  one  form  and  another  have  been 
transmitted  from  the  past.  In  Ontario  and  Quebec  all  militia 
records  were  transferred  and  the  result  is  that  to-day  their 
forces  are  regarded  as  4  continuation  of  those  existing  anterior 
to  confederation,  while  ours  has  been  in  some  quarters  erron- 
eously believed  to  have  been  of  a  much  later  creation.  But 
it  is  submitted  that  these  pages  show  conclusively  that  the 
company  of  John  Colville,  founded  in  1793,  lived  to  become 
a  part  of  the  regiment  formed  in  1838,  the  record  of  which 
under  that  designation  is  now  brought  to  a  close.  Its  future 
history  will  be   told    in    the    succeeding    chapters    under   other 


I40  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

titles.     As  a  further  evidence  of  continuity  it  may  here  be  stated 
that  in   1868  the  regimental  officers  were:

N  the  7th  January  there  was  an  assembly  in  the  old  drill 
shed.  Merritt's  building,  Princess  St.,  of  Pick's,  Far- 
^  mer's  and  Kerr's  batteries,  at  which  a  medal  for  shooting 

was  presented  to  a  gunner  of  Major  Pick's  battery  whose  name 
is  not  recorded  in  the  brief  chronicles  of  the  time.  This  was 
probably  the  last  occasion  on  which  the  batteries  assembled  as 
component  parts  of  the  old  regiment.  Early  in  February  Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Foster  sent  his  service  rolls  to  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Maunsell  to  get  some  difficulties  straightened  out. 
In  some  cases,  such  as  the  batteries  at  Chatham  and  Portland, 
every  officer  and  man  had  re-enrolled  and  the  number  of  lieu- 
tenants was  greater  than  the  regulations  allowed.  These  officers 
had  commissions  under  the  old  law  and  the  subject  was  a 
difficult  one  to  deal  with.  Happily,  through  the  assistance  and 
kind  endeavors  of  Major  J  ago,  then  assistant  adjutant-general 
of  artillery  for  the  province,  matters  were  brought  into  a  state 
of  harmony.  It  is,  indeed,  difficult  to  realize  the  extent  of  the 
obligations  of  our  corps  to  Lieutenant-Colonels  Maunsell  and 
Jago.  At  the  time  there  was  great  uncertainty  as  to  the 
positions  these  gentlemen  would  occupy.  The  latter  had  not 
for  some  years   after  confederation  a  regular  appointment,    but 


142  HISTORICAL    RFXORD3    OF    THE 

was  continued  in  his  position  as  if  by  sufferance  and  without 
that  authority  which  his  abiHty  and  the  importance  of  his  post 
demanded.  It  was  also  currently  rumored  that  there  were' 
many  applicants  for  the  post  of  D.  A.  G.,  but  fortunately  for 
the  service  in  New  Brunswick  no  changes  were  made  and  the 
new  militia  organizations  throughout  the  province  had  the  care 
and  assistance  which  was  so  greatly  needed  at  the  critical 
period  of  adaptation  to  a  new  order  of  things. 

The  continuity  upon  which  our  corps  justly  lays  so  much 
stress  is  evidenced  by  the  following  general  order  issued  from 
the  new  headquarters  under  date  of  6th  February,    1869  : 

"The  following  corps  enrolled  under  31  Vic,  c.  40,  as  well 
as  those  organized  prior  to  ist  October,  1868,  which  have 
within  three  months  after  the  act  coming  into  force,  re-enrolled 
as  volunteers,  are  declared  to  be  existing  and  continued  as  such.

and  by  order  of  5th  March   the   batteries  at  Carleton  and    St.

and  were  recognized,  and  a  similar   acceptance    of  the  battery 

at  St.  Stephen    was    given    by    general    order    of   27th    March. 

The  order  of  6th  February  also  authorized  the  formation  of  a 

battery  at  St.  George  with  the  following  officers  : 

Captain^  Charles   lMcGee^ 

First  Lieutenant^      Robert  A.  Stewart, 
Second  Lieutenant^    Joseph  M eating.

and  the  order  of  5th  March  also  authorized  another  battery  at 

St.  John,  with 

Captain^  John  Kp:rr, 

First  Lieutenant^      John  A.  Kane, 
Second  Lieutenant,    John  Evans  Daley, 

As  before  explained,  this  battery  was  raised  at  a  time  when 
there  was  no  authority  to  accept  its  services,  and  consequently 
it  does  not  appear  on  the  official  records  until  this  date. 

The    general   order  constituting  the  brigade    bears  date  26th 

May,   1869,  and  is  as  follows  : 

"The  formation  of  a  Brigade  of  Garrison  Artillery  is  hereby 
authorized,  to  be  designated  as  the  'New  Brunswick  Brigade 
of  Garrison  Artillery,'  and  will  be  composed  of  the  following 
batteries,  viz. : 

St.  John. 
Carleton. 
Portland. 
St.  Andrews. 
Woodstock. 
St.  George. 
Chatham. 
St    Stephen. 
St.  George. 
St.   John.

The  headquarters  of  the  brigade  were  not  ascertained  until 
17th  December,  when  a  general  order  fixed  them  at  St.  John. 
During   the   year    the    common    council    offered    land   at   the 


144  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

Ballast  wharf  for  the  erection  of  a  drill  shed  but  nothing  was 
done  towards  providing  the  needed  accommodation.  In  fact 
the  complaint  was  frequent  then,  as  it  is  in  some  respects  yet, 
that  the  favors  of  the  militia  department  are  reserved  for  other 
localities  than  the  Maritime  Provinces. 

The  usual  salutes  were  fired  on  the  i8th  and  24th  of  May, 
and  on  the  former  day  the  band  of  the  60th  Rifles  played.  This 
was  one  of  the  last  occasions  in  which  the  Imperial  troops  par- 
ticipated in  a  local  event  in  the  province.  With  confederation 
the  garrison  was  removed  from  St.  John  and  the  defence  of 
the  port  was  left  to  the  local  forces.  Under  the  new  regime 
a  school  of  instruction  was  opened  of  which  many  officers 
availed  themselves,  the  new  regulations  making  the  possession 
of  a  certificate  requisite  for    promotion. 

During  the  year  the  Governor-General,  Sir  John  Young 
(Lord  Lisgar)  visited  the  Province.  At  Fredericton,  on  31st 
August,  he  was  received  with  due  honors  by  the  artillery  under 
Lieutenant  Stratton,  and  on  his  arrival  at  Indiantown  on  the 
3rd  September  Major  Farmer's  battery  fired  a  salute.  A  large 
and  enthusiastic  crowd  greeted  His  Excellency  on  his  debark- 
ation from  the  steamer  David  Weston^  and  when  the  carriage 
containing  the  vice-regal  party  arrived  at  the  head  of  Portland 
another  salute  was  fired  by  Major  M.  H.  Peters'  battery  from 
Carleton  Heights.  Salutes  by  Captain  Kerr's  from  Market 
Square,  and  Major  Pick's  from  King  Square  announced  the 
further  progress  of  the  party,  and  a  guard  of  honor  from  the 
78th  Highlanders  was  drawn  up  at  the  Waverley  Hotel.  Next 
day  a  levee  was  held  in  the  Court  House,  the  78th  again  fur- 
nishing the  guard  of  honor.  In  the  evening  a  firemen's  parade 
enlivened  the  scene. 

St.  John    received  a  royal   visitor    on    the  7th  of  the  month 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 45 

in  the  person  of  H.  R.  H.  Prince  Arthur,  Duke  of  Con- 
naught.  The  usual  salutes  were  fired  by  the  batteries  and  the 
62nd  St.  John  Volunteer  Battalion  shared  in  this  as  in  the 
other  celebrations.  A  ball  was  held  in  the  evening  and  on 
the  following  day  there  were  more  salutes  and  the  usual  re- 
joicing. On  September  loth,  H.  R.  H.  visited  Fredericton, 
where  Lieutenant  Stratton's   company  paid  the  usual  honors. 

In  the  fall  rifle  competition  Gunner  Fallen  of  Major  Gil- 
lespie's battery  won  both  first  prizes,  the  Prince  of  Wales'  cup 
and  medal,  and  the  event  was  duly  celebrated  at  Chatham  by 
his  comrades. 

There  was  another  Fenian  scare  this  year,  which,  though  it 
did  not  immediately  culminate,  caused  unusual  preparations  to 
be  made.  The  62nd  Battalion  were  ordered  to  be  in  readiness 
but  there  does  not  seem  to  have  been  any  call  for  the  services 
of  the  artillery. 

The  next  year,  1870,  was  uneventful.  Probably  the  most 
disagreeable  feature  of  it  was  a  review  on  24th  May  during  a 
snow  storm.  The  artillery  had  ten  guns  on  parade,  three  drawn 
by  horses  and  the  rest  by  hand.  A  royal  salute  was  fired  at 
noon  and  the  shivering  soldiers  took  but  little  comfort  from 
the  fact  that  the  weather  was  so  exceptional  as  to  become 
historic. 

No.  3,  the  Portland  battery  which  has  always  displayed  a  great 
deal  of  enterprise  in  social  affairs  made  arrangements  for  hold- 
ing a  picnic  on  the  9th  August,  at  Oak  Point,  on  the  St.  John, 
river.  No  doubt  it  was  successful  but  the  newspapers  of  the 
day  do  not  record  it.  Gunner  Joseph  Ewing,  who  afterwards 
obtained  command  of  the  battery  got  his  first  step  this  year, 
being  appointed  second  lieutenant. 

The  next  year  opened  with  a  ball  on  St.  Valentine's  day  by 


146  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OV    THE 

Captain  Kerr's  battery.  The  Queen's  birthday  was  observed 
by  a  review  under  circumstances  much  more  favorable  than 
those  of  the  previous  year.  Salutes  were  fired  by  all  the  batteries 
during  the  morning  and  at  noon  they  joined  with  the  Royal 
Artillery,  while  the  62nd  fired  a  feu  de  joie.  The  latter  corps 
presented  an  address  to  their  retiring  Lieutenant-Colonel, 
Charles  R.  Ray. 

The  artillery  inspection  was  held  on  3rd  October  by  Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Maunsell  and  Major  Jagg,  at  which  the  brigade 
turned  out  about  two  hundred  strong.  In  the  evening  the 
officers  gave  a  dinner  to  the  inspecting  officer. 

In  the  same  month  Lord  Lisgar  again  passed  through  the 
city,  and  the  artillery  fired  the  customary  salutes.  The  62nd 
Battalion  does  not  appear  to  have  taken  part  at  this  time  as  it 
had,  most  unfortunately,  been  disbanded  some  time  before  for 
non-compliance  with  a  general  order,  and  was  then  only  in  the 
process  of  re-organization.  Since  this  time  the  two  corps  have 
gone  on  side  by  side,  each  emulating  the  other's  successes  and 
sharing  the  trials  and  disappointments  incident  to  militia  ser- 
vice. Major  Melick,  the  senior  regimental  major,  retired  on 
7th  December,  187 1,  with  the  rank  of  lieutenant-colonel.  He 
was  succeeded  by  Brevet  Major  Pick.  The  junior,  Major 
Mount,  also  retired  with  rank  of  brevet  lieutenant-colonel,  and 
was  succeeded  by  Major  Martin  Hunter  Peters.  Captain 
J.  Alfred  Ring  then  succeeded  to  the  command  of  No.  2 
battery,  Carleton,  which  he  held  for  thirteen  years. 

1872  is  remembered  as  the  year  of  the  first  brigade  camp 
at  the  Barrack  Square,  St.  John,  where  two  hundred  and  fifty 
officers  and  men  of  the  artillery,. with  a  volunteer  band,  assem- 
bled on  August  23rd.  All  the  city  batteries  turned  out  and 
were  joined  by  those  of  Woodstock   and    Chatham.     A  church

parade  to  St.  Paul's  church  was  held  on  Sunday,  the  25th 
inst.,  and  the  Chatham  battery  returned  to  their  home  on 
the  29th.  The  prize  for  the  best  shot  in  the  brigade  was 
awarded  to  Bomb.  J.  Brown  of  No.  10,  now  No.  4  company, 
and  Mrs.  Jago's  prize  fell  to  No.  i  battery.  Inspection  was 
held  on  the  30th  and  the  men  made  a  very  creditable  showing. 
In  a  few  days  they  had  become  accustomed  to  camp  life  and 
acquired  a  degree  of  proficiency  that  weeks  of  drill  under 
other  conditions  would  not  have  given  them.  In  this  year 
John  A.  Kane  became  Captain  of  No.  i  battery,  in  which 
position  he  served  until  1885,  maintaining  a  good  standard  of 
efficiency.  Captain  Kane's  services  as  an  officer  began  in  No. 
10,  under  Captain  Kerr,  in  1869.  He  afterwards  had  as 
lieutenant  Mr.,  now  Major,  Drury  of  the  Royal  Canadian 
Artillery,  and  this  officer  is  a  grandson  of  the  late  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Richard  Hayne. 

In  March  of  the  following  year  No.  10  battery  lost  a  valu- 
able officer  by  the  death  of  Captain  John  King,  who  had  re- 
organized the  battery  in  the  previous  year,  it  having  become 
non-effective.  His  funeral,  which  took  place  on  the  loth  March, 
was  attended  by  members  of  the  battery  and  of  the  Masonic 
order.  The  interment  was  in  the  burial  ground  on  Lancaster 
Heights.  He  was  succeeded  in  command  by  an  enthusiastic 
volunteer  officer.  Captain  Andrew  J.  Armstrong,  whose  ser- 
vices must  be  frequently  referred  to  in  this  volume. 

During  1873  N^^w  Brunswick  was  honored  by  a  visit  from 
the  new  governor-general,  Lord  Dufferin,  who  arrived  in  St. 
John  by  the  western  train  on  19th  August  and  was  received 
by  salutes  from  all  the  batteries  and  the  ringing  of  the  church 
bells.  The  62nd  Battalion  furnished  a  guard  of  honor,  and 
addresses    were    presented    by    the    civic    officials    and    various 


148  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

public  bodies.  The  citizens  vied  with  each  other  to  do  honor 
to  the  popular  representative  of  royalty  and  he  was  well  enter- 
tained during  his  stay  in  St.  John.  A  drawing  room  was  held 
on  the  20th  which  was  attended  by  the  officers  of  militia 
corps  in  large  numbers.  The  next  day's  celebrations  included 
one  of  the  regattas  for  which  the  city  is  famous,  and  oh  the 
following  day  His  Excellency  visited  the  capital  of  the  prov- 
ince when  the  military  honors  were  done  by  a  provisional 
company  under  command  of  Captain  Beckwith.  This  gentle- 
man, who  had  been  adjutant  of  the  71st  Battalion,  had  for 
some  years  previous  assembled  a  number  of  men  to  fire  the 
customary  salute  at  the  opening  of  the  sessions  of  the  House 
of  Assembly.  This  led  him  to  think  of  the  formation  of  an 
artillery  company,  and  about  1870  he,  with  Mr.  John  Allen, 
son  of  the  Chief  Justice,  as  a  prospective  lieutenant,  made  up 
a  roll  of  men  willing  to  join  such  an  organization.  This  was 
forwarded  by  the  D.  A.  G.  with  his  recommendation,  but  no 
reply  was  received  by  Captain  Beckwith  from  headquarters. 
About  a  year  afterwards  Captain  Beckwith  was  advised  by 
Colonel  P.  Robertson  Ross,  then  commanding  the  Canadian 
militia,  to  forward  another  application,  which  he  did,  but  like 
the  preceding  one  it  received  no  official  answer.  It  after- 
wards transpired  that  the  authorities  at  headquarters  were  will- 
ing to  establish  a  field  battery,  but  thought  Fredericton  to  be 
too  far  inland  for  the  useful  service  of  a  garrison  battery,  and 
the  matter  dropped.  An  effort  to  raise  a  battery  among  the 
I.  C.  R.  employees  at  Moncton  was  also  discouraged,  and 
though  a  service  roll  was  forwarded  the  movement  went  no 
further. 

An  unfortunate  accident  marred  the  pleasant  progress  of  the 
governor-general    through    the    province.      When    at    Chatham 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 49 

Captain  Gillespie's  battery  turned  out  to  salute,  and  probably 
through  the  hurry  of  enthusiasm  there  was  some  oversight  in 
the  service  of  the  vent  or  sponging  out  the  gun.  Whatever 
the  cause  may  have  been  it  is  sad  to  relate  that  two  men, 
Gunners  J.  Murray  and  R.  Steel,  lost  their  lives  by  a  pre- 
mature discharge.  An  inquiry  was  ordered  and  the  cause  was 
reported  to  have  been  an  unavoidable  accident.  The  event 
cast  a  gloom  over  the  battery  and  greatly  lessened  its-  efficiency 
for  some  time. 

At  the  competition  in  September  Mrs.  Jago's  silver  cup  was 
won  by  Sergeant  C.  Belyea  of  No.  3  battery,  and  the  officers 
silver  cup  by  No.  2  battery.  Captain  Cunard,  a  valuable 
officer,  afterwards  district  storekeeper,  assumed  command  of 
No.  3  this  year  in  succession  to  Brevet  Major  Farmer,  who 
became  quartermaster  in  place  of  W.  A.  Lockhart. 

Early  in  the  following  year,  on  the  appointment  of  Lieuten- 
ant-Governor Tilley,  a  levee  was  held  in  St.  John,  and  the 
event  was  celebrated  by  a  salute  from  the  guns  of  Captain 
Kane's  battery.  Captain  G.  Fred  Ring  and  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Saunders  were  appointed  provincial  aides-de-camp,  and 
Lieutenant-Colonel  J  ago  with  Captains  F.  B.  Hazen  and  Likely 
attended  with  a  guard  of  honor.  An  address  was  presented  to 
the  new  governor  by  the  corporation  of  St.  John,  he  having 
for  many  years  represented  that  constituency  both  in  the  local 
and  federal  parliaments. 

On  the  26th  February  there  was  a  grand  gathering  in  Smith's 
Hall,  when  the  prizes  won  at  the  autumn  competition  were 
presented  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Maunsell  The  great  event 
of  the  year,  however,  was  'Camp  Dufferin,'  held  at  the  Bar- 
rack Square,  which  opened  on  the  23rd  July,  and  consisted  of 
No.    I  battery  under   Captain    Kane,  with  Lieutenants  Drurv

and  Wallace  ;  No.  2  under  Captain  Ring,  Lieutenants 
Carleton  and  Lander  ;  No.  3  under  Captain  Cunard,  Lieu- 
tenants Scott  and  Ewing  ;  No.  7  under  Captain  Gillespie 
and  Lieutenant  Fraser,  and  No.  10  under  Captain  Armstrong 
and  Lieutenants  King  and  Till.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Maun- 
sell  was  commandant  of  the  camp ;  Lieutenant  D.  G.  Smith 
supply  officer,  and  217  officers  and  men  were  under  canvas. 
The  force  paraded  to  St.  Paul's  church  on  the  26th,  and  next 
day  Lieutenant-Governor  Tilley  and  suite  paid  a 'visit  to  the 
camp.  The  usual  competition  was  held  and  resulted  in  the 
winning  by  No.  10  of  the  first  prize;  Nos.  2  and  3  tied  for 
the  second.  No.  10  also  won  a  cup  presented  by  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Thurgar,  and  Quartermaster  Sergeant  Armstrong  of 
No.  3  won  a  silver  medal  presented  by  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Thurgar,  jr.  During  the  camp  Gunner  Samuel  McIntyre 
of  No.  3  was  taken  ill,  and  his  death  in  August  caused  sad- 
ness to  his  comrades  in  their  recollection  of  a  pleasant  camp. 
He  was  buried  with  military  honors  by  his  battery.  The  year 
closes  with  a  more  pleasant  event  in  the  marriage  of  Captain 
Cunard  on  2nd  December.  The  gallant  captain  entertained 
the  men  of  No.  3  at  supper  on  the  evening  preceding  the 
ceremony  and  received  a  royal  salute  from  his  congratulatory 
gunners.  During  the  year  No.  5  battery,  Woodstock,  was 
made  a  field  battery  and  ceased  to  be  connected  with  the 
brigade.  No.  9  battery,  St.  George,  was  transferred  to  the 
infantry  of  Charlotte  county,  and  No.  8  at  St.  Stephen  had 
become  non-effective. 

The  year  1875  i^  practically  without  record  except  that  No. 
3  battery  with  its  usual  enterprise  held  a  soiree  in  the  Portland 
Temperance  hall  which  closed  with  a  dance,  about  ninety  couples 
being  on  the  floor. 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY,  I5I 

In  this  year  Lieutenant-Colonel  Jago  was  appointed  assistant 
inspector  of  artillery  for  New  Brunswick  and  Nova  Scotia. 

A  very  important  step  was  taken  by  the  officers  of  the 
brigade  on  the  21st  January,  1876,  when  they  assembled  in 
Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster's  office  to  consider  the  formation 
of  the  Dominion  Artillery  Association.  In  1873  ^  Provincial 
association  had  been  brought  into  existence,  entirely  through  the 
efforts  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  Jago,  but  owing  to  the  small  num- 
ber of  batteries  and  the  limited  membership,  it  had  not  been 
able  to  accomplish  very  much.  It  had,  however,  laid  the 
foundation  of  good  work  in  this  direction  and  emphasized  the 
necessity  for  such  an  organization.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Maun- 
SELL,  who  presided  at  the  meeting,  was  appointed  a  delegate 
to  represent  the  brigade  at  the  organization  meeting  in  Ottawa. 

No.  3  battery  laid  another  comrade.  Gunner  Lane  Dunham, 
to  rest  on  the  2nd  February,  escorting  the  remains  from  Fort 
Howe  to  Lancaster  Heights.  The  firing  party  was  under  com- 
mand of  Lieutenant  Ewing. 

The  brigade  lost  a  good  friend  and  excellent  officer  by  the 
resignation  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  Jago  of  the  post  of  assistant 
adjutant-general  of  artillery.  He  sailed  for  England  in  April, 
previous  to  which  he  was  presented  with  an  address  at  the 
Park  Hotel  by  the  officers  of  the  artillery.  The  address  was 
read  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster,  and  Majors  Pick,  Peters 
and  Farmer,  Captains  Underhill,  Cunard,  Kane,  Ring, 
Armstrong,  Lieutenants  Drurv,  Wallace  and  King,  and 
Surgeon  Daniel,  were  present.  He  left  St.  John  on  the  20th, 
the  band  of  the  62  nd  Battalion  playing  a  farewell,  and  the 
batteries  firing  a  salute. 

The  artillery,  together  with  the  engineers  and  62nd  Battalion, 
were  called  out  on  the  12th  of  July  in  aid  of  the  civil  power. 


152  HISTORICAL    RFXORDS    OF   THE 

a  disturbance  being  apprehended  on  the  occasion  of  the  Orange 
celebration.  But  happily  it  was  found  that  the  good  citizens 
of  St.  John  were  so  peaceably  disposed  that  the  services  of 
the  mihtia  were  not  required,  and  after  being  a  few  hours 
under  arms  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  dismissed  the  force. 
Only  one  man  was  shot  that  day.  He  was  in  the  procession 
and  carried  a  revolver.  By  some  carelessness  in  handling  it 
was  accidentally  discharged,  causing  him  a  flesh  wound  in  the 
thigh,  and  this  was  the  only  blood  shed! 

The  first  competition  for  prizes  offered  by  the  Dominion 
Artillery  Association  was  held  in  August  and  the  winners  were 
as  follows  : 

No.   I  Battery. 

ist,  Corporal  Roberts, 
2nd,  Sergeant  McGaw, 
3rd,    Gunner  McIlwaine. 

No.  2  Battery. 

I  St,    Lieutenant  Lander, 

2nd,  Captain  Ring, 

3rd,    Gunner  J.  J.  Gordon, 

No.  3  Battery.

2nd,  Gunner  Graham, 
3rd,    Sergeant  Brown. 

No.   10  Battery. 

I  St,    Sergeant  Dunlop, 

2nd,  Sergeant  C.  F.  Langan, 

3rd,    Sergeant  Magee. 

The  prizes  were  presented  in  the  Carleton  City  Hall  on  the 
5th  September. 

It  is  worthy  of  note  that  with  the  many  apparent  disadvan- 
tages   under    which    the    corps    was    laboring,    the  inspector   of 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 53 

rrtillery,  Lieutenant-Colonel  Strange,  should  have  been  able 
to  say  in  1871  that  with  the  exception  of  the  New  Brunswick 
Artillery,  he  believed  few  batteries  in  the  Dominion  had  made 
gunnery  their  main  object.  This  opinion  was  strongly  sup- 
ported by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Jago,  who  had  done  his  best  to 
bring  up  the  efficiency  of  the  corps,  and  who  felt  that  it  was 
at  that  time  the  best  in  the  Dominion.  Again,  in  1876,  Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Strange  in  his  annual  report  said  : 

"The  gun  drill  and  practice  of  the  brigade  was  very  good. 
And  I  am  of  opinion  that  with  the  exception  of  the  men  of  the 
two  gunnery  schools,  who  practically  are  regular  soldiers,  the 
New  Brunswick  Garrison  Artillery  is  unsurpassed  among  those 
I  have  seen  in  the  Dominion.  I  have  less  hesitation  in  pay- 
ing this  tribute  to  their  efficiency,  because  I  can  claim  no 
part  of  the  credit  of  their  instruction,  which  must  be  given  to 
my  late  assistant,  Lieutenant-Colonel  Darrel  Jago,  late  Royal 
Artillery,  and  to  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster,  who  has  for  many 
years  commanded  them  and  labored  for  their  efficiency,  no 
doubt  assisted  by  the  commanding  officers  of  batteries,  and 
by  his  adjutant,  Major  Underbill,  who  has  a  first-class  cer- 
tificate from  the  Kingston  Gunnery  School.  Major  Cunard's, 
No.  3  battery,  was  not  drawn  for  drill  this  year,  but  they  per- 
formed their  duties  without  pay,  which  marks  the  esprit  that 
exists  in  the  New  Brunswick  Artillery." 

In  this  period  there  are  but  a  few  other  changes  to  be 
specially  noted,  most  of  the  appointments  being  dealt  with  only 
in  the  appendix.  Surgeon  Berryman  retired  in  1875  being 
succeeded  by  J.  W.  Daniel,  M.  D.,  in  1876.  The  latter  had 
been  appointed  assistant  surgeon  in  1875  in  succession  to 
Joseph  Andrews,  M.  D.,  who  had  left  the  province.  Dr. 
Andrews  w^as  re-appointed  assistant  surgeon  in  1883  and  still 
holds  that  rank.  Dr.  Stephen  Smith,  assistant  surgeon  of  the 
old  corps,  was  transferred  to  the  Woodstock  field  battery  at 
the  time  of  its  becoming  a  separate  organization.

1877-1884. 

Great  Fire  at  St.  John — Services  of  the  Artillery — Mining  the  Walls 
— A  Brave  Eescue— Visit  of  H.  B.  H.  the  Frincess  Louise  and 
the  Marquis  of  Lome — Celebration  of  the  Loyalist  Centennial — 
Betirement  of  Lieutenant-  Colonel  Foster. 


'HE  year  1877  will  long  be  a  memorable  one  in  the 
annals  of  St.  John,  distinguished  as  it  was  by  the 
greatest  of  the  many  conflagrations  by  which  the  city 
has  been  visited.  Breaking  out  at  half-past  two  o'clock  on 
Wednesday  afternoon,  June  20th,  in  nine  hours  the  entire 
business  portion  of  the  city  and  a  great  part  of  the  residential 
district  was  destroyed.  The  loss  was  enormous  in  proportion 
to  the  size  and  wealth  of  the  city.  But  the  same  qualities 
which  have  made  good  artillerymen  of  the  sons  of  the  city, 
pluck,  intelligence  and  determination,  have  long  since  raised  a 
newer  and  better  St.  John  in  the  place  of  the  desolated  city. 
One  great  loss,  however,  can  never  be  made  good.  The  city 
of  the  loyalists  was  filled  with  mementoes  of  her  founders  and 
possessed  a  vast  store  of  collected  information  which  would 
have  been  of  great  use  to  the  archivist  and  the  historian. 
These  were  destroyed  and  among  them  many  a  muster  roll 
and  reminiscence  of  the  old  days  of  the  volunteer  artillery. 
Throughout  the  hours  of  panic  on  that  memorable  June  day 
the  militia  of  the  city  proved  themselves  worthy  of  their  call- 
ing, and  during  the  period  of  insecurity  which  followed,  the 
peace  and  safety  of  the  city  largely  depended  upon  their  efforts. 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 55 

The  old  barracks,  with  the  uniforms  of  Nos.  i  and  lo  bat- 
teries and  of  the  62nd  Battalion,  were  destroyed  despite  the 
brave  efforts  of  men  of  both  corps  led  by  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Mauxsell,  D.  a.  G.,  Brigade-Major  Macshane,  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Blaine,  Captain  Hall  and  others. 

Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  was  then  the  senior  officer  in  St. 
John,  and  two  days  after  the  fire  he  was  requested  by  Mayor 
Earle,  Alderman  John  Kerr  and  Wm.  Elder,  Esq.,  J.  P.,  to 
provide  a  military  force  to  guard  the  unopened  vaults  of  the  banks 
and  large  business  houses  which  were  exposed  to  the  depre- 
dations of  a  lawless  element.  Private  properties,  too,  and  the 
temporary  quarters  of  such  banks  as  were  able  to  resume  busi- 
ness required  more  protection  than  could  be  afforded  by  the 
small  police  force.  A  force  was  at  once  raised  from  the  artil- 
lery, Nos.  2  and  3  batteries  at  first  principally  contributing  the 
men,  owing  to  the  loss  of  uniforms  which  the  other  batteries 
had  sustained.  To  No.  3  battery  is  due  the  credit  of  having 
the  first  men  on  duty  after  the  requisition  was  made  on  the 
morning    of   the    22nd    June.      The    detail    was    composed  as 

follows  : — - 

Brevet  Major  Wm.  Cunard,  commanding. 

First    Lieutenant  Joseph  Ewing. 
Sergeants :  J.  S.  Brown,  T.  A.  Graham. 
Corporals  :  John  Vincent,  J.  R    Andrews. 
Bombardiers  :  W.  Bell,  W.  McJunkin,  Wm.  Lee. 
Gunners  :  Jos.  Lee,  A.  Long,  S.  Torrey,  C.  Garrett,  John 
Speight,  James  Lee,    G.  Crawford,   C.  Young,    Justus 
Mowry,    H.  Saunders,    W.  Morgan,  R.  A.  C.  Brown, 
John  Andrews,  W.  Crawford,  R.  Carlin. 

The  detachment  mustered  pursuant  to  orders  at  their  drill 
room,  Temperance  Hall,  Simonds  street,  Portland,  at  2  p.  m., 
and  marched  thence  to  Charlotte  street,  opposite  the  country 
market,  where  at  2.30  p.  m.  men  were  told  off  for  duty.     The 


156  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

first  work  was  the  mining  of  the  front  wall  of  the  Post  Office 
on  Prince  William  street  and  the  posting  of  sentries  at  several 
points.  Other  men  of  the  artillery,  as  well  as  a  portion  of 
the  62  nd  Battalion,  were  soon  on  duty.  The  latter  corps, 
whose  uniforms  were  destroyed,  obtained  a  supply  from  the 
stores  of  the  74th  Battalion,  The  artillery  were  on  duty  from 
22nd  June  to  5th  July  and  contributed  a  force  varying  from 
seventy  to  ninety-two  officers  and  men.  A  camp  was  formed 
on  King  Square  and  guards  were  detailed  for  day  and  night 
duty.  Besides  this  the  artillery  were  employed  in  the  demolition 
of  dangerous  walls  which  were  everywhere  standing  and  threaten- 
ing the  safety  of  laborers  and  passers-by.  In  this  service  the 
men  faced  danger  as  great  as  that  of  the  battle  field,  and  the 
reader  is  reminded  of  the  sad  fate  of  the  late  Major  Short 
of  "B."  battery,  R.  C.  A.,  when  reading  the  following  extract 
from  Stewart's  History  of  the  Fire,  which  tells  of  a  narrow 
escape  of  Sergeant  Lamb  of  the  artillery  : 

"At  the  blowing  down  of  the  walls  of  the  post  office  an  act 
of  valour  was  performed  by  some  men  belonging  to  the  artil- 
lery which  deserves  prominent  mention.  Major  Cunard,  Cap- 
tain A.  J.  Armstrong  and  Lieutenants  Inch  and  Ewing, 
together  with  a  detachment  of  the  Brigade  of  New  Brunswick 
Artillery,  under  the  command  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  S.  K. 
Foster,  marched  to  Prince  William  street  and  proceeded  to 
blow  down  the  walls  of  the  post  office.  Sentries  were  posted 
all  around  a  circle  of  nearly  two  hundred  yards,  and  everything 
being  in  readiness  the  work  was  begun.  Two  bags  of  powder 
were  placed  against  the  building  with  the  length  of  spouting 
which  would  contain  the  port  fire  fuse  that  was  to  connect 
with  the  powder.  Two  charges  went  off  and  the  effect  on  the 
walls  was  slight.  The  men  thought  of  the  expediency  of  plac- 
ing a  charge  against  the  inside  as  well  as  one  on  the  outside 
of  the  building.  The  trains  were  laid  and  fuses  lit,  but  some 
loose  powder  igniting  in  a  moment  with  the  train  it  exploded 
with  a  deafening  crash   before   the    men    could   get  away,  and 


N.    P..    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  157 

half  of  the  wall  facing  Prince  William  street  came  down  as  if 
a  thunderbolt  had  struck  it.  Gunner  John  Nixon,  of  No.  2 
battery,  was  covered  with  the  debris  but  escaped  uninjured 
save  a  few  scratches  on  the  arm  and  a  cut  or  two.  Gunner 
Walter  Lamb,  of  No.  10  battery,  was  struck  down  and  every- 
one deemed  him  dead,  the  smoke  and  debris  completely  hiding 
him.  The  second  70  pound  blast  was  still  burning,  and  was 
momentarily  expected  to  go  off,  when  Lamb's  hand  was  seen 
to  raise  over  his  head  and  touch  his  cap.  In  a  moment  five 
men,  unmindful  of  the  terrible  fate  which  threatened  them, 
rushed  in  and  bravely  dragged  from  the  mass  of  ruins  their 
fallen  comrade.  He  was  borne  away  just  as  the  second  charge 
went  off  with  a  roar  carrying  away  at  a  bound  the  remainder 
of  the  wall.  Stones  and  bricks  flew  in  every  direction,  and 
John  Anderson,  who  was  standing  on  Germain  street,  but 
whose  presence  there  was  unknown,  fell  badly  wounded.  He 
was  conveyed  to  the  hospital  and  died  in  a  few  days.  The 
names  of  the  five  artillerymen  who  behaved  so  bravely  are. 
Lieutenant  Inch,  No.  10,  Lieutenant  Wm.  Kin(;,  No.  10, 
Corporal  J.  R.  Andrews,  No.  3,  Corporal  Anderson,  No.  i, 
and  Gunner  R.  McJunkin,  No.  10.  Captain  Ring,  of  Carle- 
ton  battery,  was  standing  within  three  paces  of  Gunner  Lamb 
when  he  fell.     His  escape  was  certainly  miraculous. 

This  explosion  also  severely  injured  Lieutenant  Ewing  of 
No.  3,  who  was  within  a  few  yards  of  the  building.  He  had 
to  be  carried  away.  He  remembers  Corporal  Andrews  and 
three  other  men  running  from  King  street  to  the  assistance  of 
Gunner  Lamb  and  extricating  him  at  the  peril  of  their  lives. 
Their  bravery,  strange  to  say,  never  received  official  recognition 
from  headquarters. 

The  force  was  strengthened  on  the  arrival  of  H.  M.  S.  Argus 
from  Halifax  with  the  marine  artillery  and  some  soldiers  of  the 
97th  Regiment.  The  whole  force  was  under  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Foster,  who  was  then  the  senior  lieutenant-colonel  in  the 
Dominion.  The  militia  were  specially  commended  for  their 
services  by  the  D.  A.  G.  in  his  annual  report.     He  said  : 


158  HISTORICAL   RECORDS    OF   THE 

Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  has  informed  me  that  while  the 
presence  of  a  considerable  armed  force  was  absolutely  necessary 
in  preserving  law  and  order  at  such  a  time  as  this,  when  thous- 
ands of  able-bodied  men  were  thrown  out  of  employment  and  left 
without  house  or  home,  all,  or  nearly  all,  of  the  arduous  duties  of 
guards  and  picquets  devolved  upon  the  force  of  active  militia 
of  St.  John,  then  under  arms,  the  individual  members  of  which 
were,  in  many  instances,  themselves  left  without  house  or  home, 
and  most  creditable,  I  consider,  to  them,  to  the  officer  in 
command  (Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster),  and  to  their  officers  and 
men  generally,  was  the  discipline  maintained,  as  well  as  the 
manner  in  which  duties  were  performed. 

One  of  those  little  incidents  occurred  during  the  time  the 
volunteers  were  on  duty  which  illustrates  the  absurdity  to  which 
technical  questions  of  authority  may  sometimes  come.  The 
chief  of  police,  John  R.  Marshall,  whose  long  service  in  the 
artillery  has  before  been  mentioned,  apparently  thought  that  not- 
withstanding the  presence  of  the  soldiery  he  was  still  responsible 
for  the  peace  of  the  city,  and  by  some  oversight  no  orders 
appear  to  have  been  issued  as  to  the  co-operation  of  the  mili- 
tary with  the  police  force  or  that  any  respect  should  be  shown 
to  its  officers.  Consequently  we  find  one  of  the  newspapers 
abusing  the  chief  of  police  in  round  terms  for  having  forced 
a  sentry,  and  there  is,  on  file,  a  report  from  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Blaine  to  the  effect  that  the  chief  refused  to  answer  the 
challenge  of  the  sentry  at  the  Bank  of  New  Brunswick,  on 
Carleton  street,  but,  revolver  in  hand,  drove  him  back  on  his 
comrades.  The  attention  of  the  civic  authorities  was  called  to 
the  affair,  but  presumably  a  better  understanding  was  arrived 
at  as  the  matter  dropped. 

Owing  to  the  loss  of  clothing  and  want  of  drill  accommo- 
dation, the  annual  drill  of  the  corps  for  the  year  was  much 
interfered  with.      The    erection    of  a  new    drill  shed,  which    is 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 59 

Still  in  use,  was  begun,  but,  unfortunately,  the  distance  of  the 
site  from  the  centre  of  population  and  the  inadequate  accom- 
modation  of  the  building  has  always  militated  against  the  in- 
terests of  the  St.  John  force.  For  a  city  of  the  size  and 
importance  of  St.  John  the  facilities  for  drill  and  military 
association  are,  in  this  respect,  far  inferior  to  those  of  any 
other  part  of  the  Dominion,  and  it  is  the  hope  of  all  that 
before  long  some  better  provision  may  be  made  for  the  force, 
which  of  all  departments  of  the  public  service,  gives  most  and 
gets  least.  The  armament  of  Fort  Dufferin  was  completed  in 
this  year  by  the  addition  of  five  64-pr.  rifled  guns. 

The  year  1878  opened  with  considerable  uneasiness  in  Europe, 
and  for  a  time  it  seemed  probable  that  another  great  war  would 
be  added  to  the  world's  history.  So  great  did  the  danger  ap- 
pear that  preparations  were  made  among  the  colonial  forces 
for  local  defence,  and  on  22  nd  May  orders  were  issued  to  the 
corps  in  the  New  Brunswick  district  to  hold  themselves  in 
readiness  for  any  service.  At  Deer  Island,  St.  George,  St. 
Andrews  and  St.  Stephen,  being  exposed  places,  the  men  were 
directed  to  have  the  arms  in  their  possession  at  once.  Even 
before  this  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  issued  a  regimental  order 
for  batteries  Nos.  i,  2,  3  and  10  to  recruit  to  their  full 
strength  and  to  be  held  in  readiness  for  immediate  duty  at  Fort 
Dufferin,  Partridge  Island,  Fort  Howe,  Carleton  Heights,  Dor- 
chester battery  and  Red  Head  battery  should  a  sudden  emerg- 
ency arise.  The  defences  at  Fort  Dufferin  and  St.  Andrews 
were  strengthened,  and  the  report  of  the  D.  A.  G.  for  the  year 
commends  Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel  Underhill,  Captain 
POLLEYS  and  Captain  Ring,  of  the  artillery;  Captain  Perley, 
of  the  engineers  ;  Lieutenant-Colonel  Macshane,  Brigade-Major 
and    Lieutenant-Colonel  Cunard,   district  storekeeper,  for  their 


l6o  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

services  in  these  necessary  works.  An  offer  for  service  abroad 
was  also  made  by  Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel  Underhill  of  two 
batteries  from  the  brigade.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Maunsell,  D. 
A.  G.,  also  says  : 

"When  offers  to  serve  in  any  part  of  the  world,  at  home 
or  abroad,  were  being  freely  made  on  the  part  of  a  large 
portion  of  the  active  force  of  this  district,  it  was  deemed  ad- 
visable to  issue  orders  to  all  corps  to  hold  themselves  in 
readiness  for  any  service,  and  while,  in  every  instance,  these 
orders  were  obeyed  with  alacrity,  I  must  advert  to  the  systematic 
way  in  which  the  Garrison  Artillery  at  St.  John  (Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Foster — five  batteries)  were  detailed  for  duty  at  the 
forts  and  batteries,  with  the  view  to  every  officer,  non-com- 
missioned officer  and  man  knowing  the  part  he  would  have  to 
occupy  for  the  defence  of  the  important  harbor  of  St.  John  " 

The  corps^  was  this  year  inspected  by  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Strange,  inspector  of  artillery,  who  found  the  New  Brunswick 
artillery  together  with  those  of  Montreal  the  only  really  efficient 
artillery  forces  in  the  Dominion.  Credit  is  given  to  Captain 
PoLLEYS,  of  St.  Andrews,  who  had  successfully  reorganized  a 
battery  at  that  important  position. 

A  curious  survival  of  an  old  volunteer  custom  is  found  in 
the  records  of  this  year.  On  22nd  July  No.  i  battery  met  at 
the  Orange  Hall,  Simonds  street,  and  elected  their  non-com- 
missioned oflficers.  On  27th  December  the  Portland  battery 
celebrated  their  anniversary  in  a  very  successful  manner 
among  those  present  being  Brigade-Major  Macshane,  Lieut- 
enant-Colonel CuNARD  and  Captain   Ewing. 

In  this  year  also  a  new  battery.  No.  9,  was  formed  under 
Captain  Thomas  W.  Lander,  at  Fairville,  in  the  county  of 
St.  John.  Captain  Lander  had  been  a  lieutenant  in  No.  2 
V)attery.  Frederick  H.  Ellis  was  gazetted  as  first  lieutenant, 
and  a  very  efficient  battery  was  raised. 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  l6l 

During  the  early  part  of  1879  the  corps  were  equipped  with 
new  helmets  which  added  much  to  their  appearance  in  the 
ceremonial  display  upon  the  arrival  of  H.  R.  H.  the  Princess 
Louise  and  His  Excellency  the  Governor-General.  The  vice- 
regal party  arrived  at  St.  John  on  6th  August  and  the  city  was 
again  en  fete  to  honor  another  member  of  the  royal  family. 
Besides  all  the  St.  John  batteries,  a  squadron  of  the  8th  cavalry 
under  Major  Domville,  the  62nd  battalion  under  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Blaine,  and  N.  B.  Engineer  Company  under  Captain 
Perley,  took  part  in  the  ceremonies  of  welcome.  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Maunsell,  D.  a.  G.,  was  in  command  of  the  whole 
force.  The  62nd  battalion  furnished  a  guard  of  honor  at  the 
railway  station,  and  the  arrival  of  the  party  was  announced  by 
salutes  from  No.  i  battery.  Captain  Kerr,  near  the  residence  of 
Hon.  Isaac  Burpee,  at  Mount  Pleasant;  No.  3,  Captain  Ewing, 
at  Zion  Church,  and  No.  10,  Captain  Armstrong,  at  Wright 
street  hill.  It  was  the  proud  duty  of  Captain  Armstrong  to 
hoist  the  royal  ensign  and  fire  the  royal  salute  of  twenty-one 
guns."  The  men  of  the  force  who  w^ere  not  engaged  in  saluting 
lined  the  streets  through  which  the  party  passed  on  their  way 
to  Reed's  Castle,  the  home  of  Captain  R.  R.  Reed,  a  veteran 
artillery  officer,  which  had  been  placed  at  the  disposal  of  the 
visitors.  Upon  their  visit  to  Carleton  the  following  day  Cap- 
tain Ring's,  No.  2,  battery  fired  a  salute  and  a  similar  honor 
was  tendered  at  Fredericton,  on  the  9th,  by  Captain  Beck- 
vvith's  company.  Upon  the  return  of  the  party  to  St.  John 
on  the  1 2th  Captain  Lander's  battery  fired  a  salute  from 
Lancaster  Heights,  and  upon  their  departure  from  the  city  the 
62  nd  again  furnished  a  guard  of  honor,  and  Captains  Kane 
and  Armstrong  fired  the  parting  salute.  The  services  of  the 
force  on  this  important  occasion  were  acknowledged  by  a  gen- 


1 62  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

eral  order  to  which  in  district  orders  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Maunsell  added  his  thanks  for  the  splendid  work  which  had 
been  done  and  his  gratification  at  the  neat  appearance  and 
cheerful  obedience  of  the  men. 

On  the  17th  January  of  this  year  Captain  Polley's  battery 
at  St.  Andrews  rendered  aid  to  the  civil  power  on  the  occasion 
of  the  execution  of  T.  Dowd,  a  murderer.  An  anticipated  riot 
was  prevented  by  prompt  action  and  the  ready  response  of  the 
battery. 

The  next  year  was  an  eventful  one  for  the  corps.  The  an- 
nual inspection  was  held  in  August,  Lieutenant-Colonel  Price 
Lewes  being  the  inspecting  officer.  At  gun  practice  No.  10 
battery,  Captain  Armstrong,  won  a  silver  mounted  clarionet, 
and  No.  i,  Captain  Kane,  a  silver  plated  clarionet,  both  the 
gifts  of  Mr.  G.  J.  Pine,  of  England,  formerly  of  St.  John. 
At  the  inspection  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  said  he  had  at- 
tended drill  for  fifty-three  years  and  had  never  missed  being 
present.  Even  assuming  that  the  veteran  officer  was  speaking 
generally,  his  was  a  splendid  record  and  worthy  of  imitation 
by  all  officers.  Few,  of  course,  can  serve  for  such  a  long 
period,  but  all  can  make  it  possible  that  their  service  shall  be 
uninterrupted.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Price  Lewes,  in  his  report 
for  the  year,  called  attention  to  the  fact  that  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Foster  had  served  for  over  fifty  years  and  deserved 
the  highest  credit  for  the  efficiency  of  his  brigade  referred  to 
in  past  reports.  He  suggested,  in  view  of  his  advanced  age, 
that  he  should  relinquish  the  active  command  of  the  brigade 
and  be  appointed  to  the  honorary  command.  This  but  fore- 
shadowed the  severance  of  the  happy  relations  which  had  so 
long  existed  between  a  worthy  officer  and  the  command  by 
which  he  was  regarded  with  respect  and  affection.

The  Provincial  Exhibition  was  opened  in  St.  John  on  5th 
October,  with  great  brilliancy  and  display,  by  Lieutenant-Gover- 
nor TiLLEV,  who  was  accompanied  by  Lieutenant-Governor  Havi- 
LAND,  of  P.  E.  L,  and  many  other  distinguished  statesmen 
and  officials.  The  salute  was  fired  from  the  guns  of  No.  10 
battery  and  the  officers  of  city  corps  attended  in  uniform. 

In  December,  to  the  regret  of  the  whole  force,  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Maunsell,  D.  a.  G.,  was  transferred  to  another  dis- 
trict and  was  succeeded  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Taylor,  who 
proved  during  his  administration  to  be  a  competent  ofificer 
with  ambition  similar  to  that  of  his  predecessor  for  the  encourage- 
ment and  improvement  of  every  branch  of  the  service.  Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Maunsell  was  tendered  a  farewell  dinner  at  the 
Dufferin  Hotel,  St.  John,  at  which  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster 
occupied  the  chair. 

On  January  20th  of  the  succeeding  year  a  very  pleasant 
gathering  was  held  at  the  residence  of  Captain  Armstrong  on 
the  occasion  of  the  presentation  to  him  by  the  non-commissioned 
ofificers  and  men  of  his  battery  of  a  handsome  framed  photo- 
graph of  the  ofificers  and  men  of  his  command.  The  presen- 
tation was  made  by  Lieutenant  King,  and  testified  that  the 
Captain  Armstrong  of  that  day  was  as  popular  as  is  the  Major 
Armstrong  of  to-day  among  all  ranks  of  the  militia.  A  sup- 
per was  served,  at-  which  Captain  Armstrong  occupied  the 
chair,  supported  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Blaine  and  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  Foster.  The  vice  chair  was  filled  by  Lieutenant 
King  who  had  on  either  hand  Major  Farmer  and  Lieutenant- 
Colonel  CuNARD.  Among  those  present  were  Captain  Kane, 
Lieutenant  Steven,  Surgeon  Daniel,  Sergeant-Major  Hughes 
and  Sergeant  Langan.  In  response  to  the  toast  of  the  *  N.  B. 
B.  G.  A.'  Lieutenant-Colonel    Foster    reviewed    the  history  of 


164  HISTORICAL    RFXORDS    OF   THE 

the  corps  and  repeated  his  claim^  which  is  now  thoroughly 
substantiated,  that  it  is  the  oldest  military  organization  in  the 
Maritime  Provinces.  To  this  statement  we  may  now  add  the 
wider  field  of  Canada. 

In  this  year  Lieutenant-Colonel  Price  Lewes  resigned  his 
position  of  assistant  inspector  of  artillery,  and  since  then  no 
officer  of  this  rank  has  been  resident  in  New  Brunswick. 

The  camp  at  Sussex  was  augmented  for  the  ist  July  by 
the  addition  of  the  N.  B.  B.  G.  A.,  the  63rd  Rifles  and  66th 
Princess  Louise  Fusiliers,  from  Halifax,  and  on  this  occasion 
the  whole  force  was  reviewed  by  His  Excellency  the  Governor- 
General,  a  total  strength  of  three  thousand  one  hundred  and 
seventy-nine  being  present. 

The  annual  inspection  was  this  year  held  at  Fort  Dufferin 
by  Major-General  Luard  and  Lieutenant-Colonel  Irwin,  in- 
spector of  artillery.  It  is  to  be  regretted  that  one  of  those 
periods  of  depression  which  occur  in  every  organization  had 
overtaken  the  force  and  that  it  was  not  able  to  maintain  its 
previous  high  character  for  efficiency.  The  attendance  was 
good  and  the  inspecting  officer  recognized  that  there  was  mater- 
ial for  doing  excellent  work  but  with  the  exception  of  some 
detachments  it  had  not  been  properly  developed.  But  the 
brigade  has  always  possessed  a  spirit  of  determination  to  sur- 
mount difficulties  and  correct  deficiencies  as  soon  as  they  are 
pointed  out  and  thus  animated  have  now  more  than  regained 
the  position  which  they  previously  held. 

In  1 88 1  was  inaugurated  the  first  of  those  artillery  compe- 
titions which  have  done  so  much  to  improve  our  force  and  to 
bring  us  into  touch  with  the  artillery  of  the  mother  country. 
Lieutenant-Colonel  Oswald,  of  the  Montreal  brigade,  had  the 
honor  of  commanding  the  first  Shoeburyness  team  and  of  bring- 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  165 

ing  to  Canada  in  triumph  the  prize  offered  by  the  Governor- 
General  for  shifting  ordnance. 

Next  year  the  old  custom  of  a  salute  on  Loyalists'  day  was 
revived,  one  being  fired  at  7  o'clock  in  the  evening  by  Cap- 
tain Armstrong's  men.  An  entertainment  commemorative  of 
the  day  was  held,  and  the  citizens  generally  began  to  prepare 
for  the  centennial  celebration  to  be  held  in  the  following  year. 
Only  Nos.  i,  2  and  10  of  the  city  batteries  drilled  this  year, 
and  No.  7  at  Chatham.  The  system  of  credits  for  the 
Dominion  Artillery  Association  prizes  was  extended  to  the 
Garrison  Artillery,  and  this  measure  more  than  any  other  has 
been  of  benefit  to  the  force.  It  has  encouraged  a  competitive 
spirit  from  Vancouver  to  Halifax  and  stimulated  all  ranks  to 
efforts  which  no  other  method  could  have  induced.  Since  this 
time,  too,  the  force  has  had  the  undivided  attention  of  Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Irwin,  as  inspector,  and  to  him  is  due  the 
credit  for  the  high  standard  which  has  steadily  been  kept 
before  it.  The  result  of  the  inspection  was  a  considerable  im- 
provement upon  that  of  the  previous  year.  In  the  competition, 
which  was  made  upon  a  basis  considerably  different  from  the 
present,  No.  i  made  125.6;  No.  2,  75.6;  No.  7,  38.2;  and 
No.   10,  93.6.     No.   I  took  third  place  in  the  Dominion. 

The  celebration  of  the  Centennial  year,  1883,  like  everything 
else  of  deep  interest  to  the  community,  was  of  great  import- 
ance to  the  corps.  Formed  by  the  loyalist  fathers  of  the 
city,  for  the  defence  of  their  infant  colony,  but  a  decade 
after  their  exile,  the  corps  has  always  felt  the  influence  of 
loyalist  tradition.  Then,  too,  its  veteran  commander  was  of 
loyalist  descent  and  felt  most  deeply  the  importance  of  an 
impressive  celebration  of  the  hundredth  anniversary  of  his 
forefathers'  stand  for    British    government.      Accordingly  active 


1 66  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

preparations  were  made  in  which  not  only  the  artillerymen  as 
militia,  but  as  citizens  participated,  and  it  was  fitting  that  at 
midnight  of  the  17th  of  May,  just  as  the  first  century  faded 
into  the  second,  the  guns  of  the  loyal  artillery  fired  a  salute 
at  the  Old  Burying  ground,  where  slumbered  men  who  had 
founded  a  city  and  strengthened  a  nation.  The  night  was  calm 
and  the  echoes  of  the  guns  could  be  heard  far  away  reverber- 
ating among  the  hills  surrounding  the  city,  as  the  chimes  of 
Trinity  church  rang  out  on  the  midnight  stillness.  At  seven 
o'clock  the  next  morning  a  salute  was  fired  consisting  of  fifty  guns 
from  No.  i.  Captain  Kane,  and  of  a  like  number  from  No.  2, 
Captain  Ring.  There  was  no  turn  out  of  the  miHtia  as  a  body, 
the  idea  being  to  reproduce  the  early  life  of  the  city,  and  in  this 
the  volunteers  ably  assisted.  In  the  great  procession  which 
traversed  air  the  principal  thoroughfares  of  the  city  no  pageant 
was  more  conspicuous  than  that  of  the  'Artillery  Company  of 
1793.'  The  uniform  and  equipment  were  faithfully  reproduced, 
and  indeed  this  was  characteristic  of  the  whole  parade.  From 
the  Indian  in  his  canoe,  who  greeted  the  Loyalists  with  a  rifle 
shot  on  their  landing,  to  the  representation  of  the  104th  Regi- 
ment on  their  famous  march,  every  detail  was  a  faithful  re- 
production of  the  original.  The  celebration  of  this  centennial 
did  much  to  arouse  interest  both  in  military  and  historical 
matters.  True  is  the  saying  of  Edmund  Burke,  'People  will 
not  look  forward  to  posterity  who  never  look  backward  to  their 
ancestors,'  and  equally  true  is  its  converse. 

A  church  parade  was  held  at  St.  Paul's  Church  on  17th 
September  of  that  year,  the  corps  being  under  the  command 
of  the  major.  Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel  M.  H.  Peters.  The 
sermon  was  preached  by  Rev.  F.  S.  Sill.  On  this  occasion 
the  corps  was  headed  by  its  fife  and  drum  band. 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  167 

The  opening  of  the  Dominion  Exhibition  on  October  ist 
was  signaHzed  by  a  salute  from  No.  lo  battery  followed  by 
H.  M.  S.  Garnet^  then  in  harbor,  running  up  the  American 
flag  and  firing  a  royal  salute.  This  courtesy  was  an  acknowl- 
edgment of  the  American  salute  to  the  British  flag  at  York- 
town.  The  U.  S.  S.  Alliance^  Commander  Reed,  immediately 
responded  with  a  salute,  and  thus,  in  the  harbor  of  the  Loy- 
alists was  evidenced  a  reconciliation,  effected  by  the  community 
of  ancestry  and  the  healing  hand  of  time. 

Inspection  was  held  on  9th  October  by  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Cotton,  assistant  inspector  of  artillery,  who,  in  his  report  ad- 
verted to  the  intended  retirement  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster, 
and  congratulated  him  on  the  state  in  which  he  would  hand  over 
the  brigade.  On  12th  December,  1883,  the  formal  announcement 
was  made  that  Lieutenant-Colonel  Stephen  Kent  Foster  was 
permitted  to  retire  retaining  rank,  and  thus  ended  the  honor- 
able service  of  a  gentleman  whose  first  artillery  commission 
bears  the  date  of  the  25th  April,  1834,  a  continuous  service 
of  nearly  half  a  century  as  an  officer  of  his  well  loved  corps, 
and  much  more  than  that  as  a  member  of  the  militia.  Con- 
sequent upon  his  retirement  the  command  of  the  brigade  de- 
volved upon  Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel  M.  H.  Peters,  who, 
being  over  the  prescribed  age  could  not  be  promoted  to  the 
regular  command. 

In  1884  Staff-Sergeant  Walling  was  sent  from  Quebec 
to  instruct  a  team  for  the  competition  which  was  held  at  the 
latter  place  in  September  and  in  which  the  brigade  had  the 
honor  of  taking  second  place  in  the  "B"  or  "go-as-you 
please"  shift.  Before  leaving  St.  John  Sergeant  Walling  was 
given  a  supper  by  the  non-commissioned  officers  of  the  brigade. 

At    the    annual    inspection  Major-General    Middleton    was 


1 68  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

present  and  expressed  himself  as  much  pleased  with  the  ap- 
pearance and  work  of  the  men.  During  the  year  Major  and 
Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel  Pick  and  Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel 
and  Adjutant  Underhill  retired  retaining  their  rank,  and  No. 
7  battery  at  Chatham  was  removed  from  the  list.  The  other 
batteries  outside  of  St.  John  had  all  become  non-effective. 
These  and  other  anticip;  ted  changes  temporarily  operated 
against  the  efficiency  of  the  corps. 

In  this  year  another  change  was  made  in  the  staff  of  the 
province,  Lieutenant-Colonel  Maunsell  returning  to  the  office 
of  D.  A.  G.  He  was  heartily  welcomed  back  to  the  position 
which  he  has  since  held,  and  in  which  it  is  the  hope  of  every 
volunteer  he  may  long  continue.

|N  9th  January,  1885,  an  announcement  of  considerable 
importance  to  the  corps  appeared  in  general  orders. 
It  was  that  Major  John  R.  Armstrong,  of  the  8th 
Cavalry  had  been  appointed  specially  and  provisionally  to  the 
command  of  the  brigade.  The  step  had  been  rendered  abso- 
lutely necessary,  but  for  some  time  the  friends  of  the  artillery 
were  anxious  as  to  the  effect  which  it  would  have  upon  the 
force. 

Fortunately  the  corps  appreciated  the  advisability  of  the  ap- 
pointment and  the  reasons  which  required  the  ordinary  rules 
of  promotion  to  be  set  aside.  Some  of  the  officers,  however, 
felt  that  they  could  no  longer  continue  in  their  positions,  and 
a  number  of  resignations  were  received.  This,  of  course,  must 
be  regretted,  as  it  is  always  unpleasant  to  see  men  w^ho  have 
served  for  a  long  time  severing  the  ties  which  bind  them  to 
the  force,  but  it  must  be  admitted  by  all,  from  the  standpoint 
of  the  present  day,  that  the  new  commanding  officer  won  the 
confidence  of  the  brigade,  was  successful  in  filling  up  the  vac- 
ancies, and  that  under  him  the  corps  has  since  equalled  if 
not  excelled  its  previous  record.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Arm- 
strong had  in   1865  been  a  private  in  the  University  Rifles  at 


I-JO  HISTORICAL    RKC0RD3    OF    THE 

King's  College,  Windsor,  N.  S.,  and  afterwards  a  gunner  in  B, 
Lester  Peters'  battery.  He  was  then  appointed  a  lieutenant 
in  the  reserve  militia  and  promoted  to  a  captaincy  therein. 
In  June,  1880,  he  received  a  commission  as  major  in  the 
Princess  Louise  Hussars. 

Soon  afterwards,  by  general  order,  No.  10  battery  became 
1%),  4  and  No.  9  was  changed  to  No.  5.  The  idea  of  main- 
taining batteries  outside  of  St.  John  was  abandoned  and  the 
brigade  was  placed  on  the  same  footing  as  it  is  to-day. 

In  March  Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel  Peters  retired  retain- 
ing his  rank.  His  was  a  long  military  career.  In  1836 
and  1837  he  had  drilled  in  an  infantry  company  at  Frederic- 
ton,  under  command  of  Captain  Fisher,  father  of  the  late 
Judge  Fisher.  In  the  fall  of  the  latter  year  he  enlisted  in 
the  York  Light  Dragoons,  under  Lieutenant-Colonel,  the  late 
Judge  WiLMOT.  In  1839  he  was  on  service  in  the  'Aroostook 
war,'  the  dragoons  being  employed  in  conveying  despatches 
from  Woodstock  to  St.  John,  a  work  of  no  small  difficulty  in 
those  ante-railroad  days.  His  corps  was  then  on  duty  about 
four  months.  In  1846  Lieutenant-Colonel  Peters  came  to  St. 
John  to  practice  his  profession,  that  of  medicine,  and  he  there 
joined  the  Queen's  New  Brunswick  Rangers  under  Lieutenant- 
Colonel,  the  Hon.  John  H.  Gray,  remaining  in  that  corps 
until  he  was  transferred  to  No.  2  battery  of  the  N.  B.  Regi- 
ment of  Artillery  at  Carleton,  of  which  he  had  command  for 
many  years,  as  before  stated.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Peters  always 
took  the  warmest  interest  in  all  things  pertaining  to  the  miUtia, 
and  his  record  of  nearly  fifty  years  of  service  almost  equals 
that  of  his  commanding  officer.  The  regret  was  general  that 
his  age  prevented  Lieutenant-Colonel  Peters  from  obtaining 
the    command    of  the   brigade,  a  reward   which  he  had     fully 


N.    15.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  I7I 

earned     by    years     of    arduous     work     and     zealous     service. 

About  this  time  several  other  changes  occurred.  Paymaster 
King  retired  with  his  rank,  and  was  succeeded  by  one  of  the 
truest  friends  of  the  corps,  the  late  Captain  George  F.  Smith. 
Later  in  the  year  Captains  Ring,  Ewing  and  Lander  retired. 
As  Captain  Kane  had  already  been  succeeded  by  George  B. 
Seely,  this  made  an  entire  change  of  captains  throughout  the 
brigade,  with  the  exception  of  No.  4  battery,  of  which  Captain 
A.  J.  Armstrong  retained  command.  There  were  but  few 
lieutenants  who  had  served  in  the  old  establishment  and  it 
was  difficult  work  for  new  men  to  prepare  the  corps  for  in- 
spection. The  loss  of  old  and  valued  officers  who  had  given 
many  years  of  service  to  the  corps  and  who  had  gained  for  it 
many  successes,  was  deeply  regretted  on  all  hands,  but  at 
that  time  the  step  seemed  to  be  necessary  in  their  judgment. 
It  is  with  pleasure  that  the  brigade  of  to-day  realizes  that 
many  of  these  officers  who  retired  are  among  its  most  active 
supporters  and  warmest  well-wishers. 

A  school  of  instruction  for  officers  was  opened  in  March 
and  conducted  by  Lieutenant,  afterwards  Captain  and  Adjutant 
Langan  and  Sergeant-Major  Hughes.  Later  in  the  year  the 
services  of  Corporal  Donnington,  R.  A.,  from  Halifax  were 
obtained. 

The  news  of  the  fight  at  Duck  Lake,  on  28th  March,  alarmed 
the  country  and  showed  that  the  uprising  of  Riel  had  attained 
the  full  proportion  of  a  rebellion.  The  enthusiasm  of  the 
militia  of  this  province  knew  no  bounds,  and  when  on  the 
nth  May  there  sounded  in  New  Brunswick  the  'trumpet  call 
throughout  the  land'  that  'needs  scarce  repeated  be'  there  was 
a  ready  response.  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong  offered  the 
services  of  the  brigade.     The  lot,  however,  fell  to  their  brethren 


172  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

of  the  62nd  battalion,  who,  in  the  short  space  of  a  week  were  en 
route.  The  scene  of  their  embarkation  at  the  I.  C.  R.  station 
is  one  that  will  never  fade  from  the  memories  of  those  who 
witnessed  it.  Though  their  services  were  not  eventually  re- 
quired yet  while  immediate  employment  was  expected  our  sister 
corps  displayed  the  readiness  to  face  danger  in  the  discharge 
of   duty    which    is    characteristic    of   the    true    British    soldier. 

Though  the  artillery  did  not  participate  in  the  conflict  yet 
Captain  Harrison,  who  lately  commanded  No.  3  company, 
saw  service  in  the  Queen's  Own  Rifles,  and  Corporal  Rich- 
ardson, who  is  referred  to  elsewhere,  served  in    "  A "  battery. 

In  September  busbies  were  adopted  as  the  brigade  head- 
dress replacing  the  helmets  and  were  provided  at  regimental 
expense.  In  the  same  month  No.  5  battery,  at  the  Orange 
hall,  Fairville,  presented  their  retiring  captain,  Thomas  W. 
Lander,  with  an  address  and  gold  headed  ebony  cane. 

On  October  4th  a  church  parade  was  held  at  St.  Paul's 
church,  the  sermon  being  preached  by  Rev.  Mr.  Walker. 
The  next  day  the  corps  was  inspected  by  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Irwin  whose  report  says :  *  Their  improvement  since  last  year 
is  most  marked,  and  the  interest  shown  by  officers  and  non- 
commissioned officers  in  acquiring  a  knowledge  of  their  duties 
promises  well  for  increased  efficiency  in  the  future.' 

The  following  was  the  establishment  of  battery  officers  at  the 

inspection  : 

No.  I  —  Captain^  Geo.  B.  Seely. 

Lieutenant^  S.  D.  Crawford. 
Second  Lieutenant^  R.  R.  Ritchie. 

No.  2 — Lieutenant  Commanding^  John  J.  Gordon. 
Second  Lieutenant^  Geo.  K.  McLeod. 

No.  3 — Lieutenant  Commanding^  Hedley  V.  Cooper. 
Second  Lieutenant^  Wm.  M.  Botsford. 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 73 

No.  4-  Captain^  A.  J.  Armstrong.

Second  Lieutefiant,  Geo.  W.  Jones. 

No.  5 — Lieutenant  Commanding^  E.  J.  Scammell. 
Second  Lieutenant^  E.  H.  Turnbull. 

In  November  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong,  Captain  Seely, 
Lieutenants  Botsford,  Jones  and  Scammell  attended  a  special 
course  at  Quebec  and  obtained  the  necessary  certificates  to 
enable  their  rank  to  be  confirmed.  Surgeon  Daniel  also  at- 
tended the  course,  and  though  the  obtaining  of  a  certificate 
was  unnecessary  for  his  position,  showed  great  proficiency  in 
the  examination  and  received  one  of  the  highest  certificates 
ever  taken  by  an  officer  of  the  corps  at  the  school.  He  is 
probably  the  only  regimental  surgeon  in  Canada  who  has  also 
the  qualification  of  a  combatant  officer.  At  the  close  of  the 
year  the  lieutenant-colonel  was  appointed  provincial  A.  D.  C. 
to  the  Lieutenant-Governor. 

The  formation  of  a  band  had  already  been  made  and  on 
New  Year's  day,   1886,  they  appeared  wearing  the  new  busbies. 

At  the  annual  meeting  of  the  officers  it  was  decided  to  pre- 
sent a  gold  medal  for  a  skating  competition  to  be  held  in  the 
Lansdowne  Rink.  The  medal  was  accordingly  prepared  and 
competed  for.  Paymaster  Smith  offered  a  prize  for  shifting 
ordnance. 

This  year  it  was  decided  to  send  another  artillery  team  to 
compete  at  Shoeburyness  and  the  choice  of  commanding  officer 
fell  upon  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong.  The  brigade  was 
also  represented  by  Sergeant  Albert  K.  Pratt,  of  No.  i  bat- 
tery, while  Sergeant  Good,  of  the  Woodstock  field  battery  was 
also  contributed  by  New  Brunswick.  Captain,  now  Major  C. 
W.  Drury,  R.    C.    a.,    a   former    officer    of   the   brigade,  was 


174  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

the  adjutant  of  the  team.  After  practice  at  Quebec  the  team 
sailed  for  England  on  22nd  July  and  arrived  at  London 
on  the  31st.  The  competition  took  place  in  the  following 
week  and  the  Canadian  team  was  most  successful.  In  the 
competition  for  the  Montreal  Merchants'  Challenge  Cup, 
which  had  previously  been  won  by  the  British  team,  the  Can- 
adians fired  against  a  detachment  selected  by  lot  from  the  win- 
ning detachments  of  the  week  previous.  The  choice  fell  on 
the  team  which  had  the  highest  score  in  the  grand  aggregate. 
Yet  the  Canadian  team  won  the  prize  and  also  the  Marquis  of 
Londonderry's  Challenge  Cup  and  the  Governor-General's  Cup 
for  a  special  shift.  They  also  won  from  ninety-two  detach- 
ments nine  silver  cups  presented  by  Sir  Richard  Wallace, 
Bart.,  M.  P.,  the  first  prize  in  a  64-pr.  firing  competition,  be- 
sides receiving  a  certificate  of  merit  in  the  10  inch  R.  M.  L.  gun 
competition.  The  record  of  the  team  is  a  high  one,  and  the 
regiment  is  deservedly  proud  of  the  fact  that  it  was  com- 
manded by  the  same  officer  who  is  at   the  head  of  the  corps. 

Captain  Armstrong  obtained  the  majority  this  year  and  dur- 
the  absence  of  the  colonel  was  in  command  of  the  brigade. 
Lieutenants  Gordon,  Botsford,  Jones  and  Scammell  were 
promoted  to  the  captaincy  of  Nos.   2,  3,  4  and  5  batteries. 

On  the  I  St  of  July  the  corps  held  a  programme  of  sports 
on  the  Barrack  square  which  was  largely  attended,  and  the 
events  included  a  shift  to  give  the  spectators  an  idea  of  the 
work  to  be  performed  by  the  Shoeburyness  team  in  England. 
An  accident  unfortunately  prevented  the  shift  being  done  in 
fast  time. 

The  year  was  essentially  one  of  church  parades.  No.  3  held 
tlie  first  at  St.  Luke's  church,  and  later  in  the  summer  Nos. 
2    and    5    attended    service    at    Carleton    Presbyterian    church.

Besides  these  there  was  the  brigade  church  parade  at  St.  Paul's 
church  on  July  12th,  when  Canon  DeVeber  preached.  This 
parade  was  under  command  of  Major  Armstrong. 

On  the  morning  of  September  29th  the  brigade,  under  Major 
Armstrong  and  headed  by  the  band,  marched  to  the  resi- 
dence of  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong,  on  Wellington  Row, 
and  welcomed  home  their  commanding  officer  with  a  general 
salute  and  an  address  of  congratulation  from  the  major  who 
had  so  ably  looked  after  the  interests  of  the  corps  during  the 
colonel's  absence. 

At  the  inspection  on  8th  October,  Lieutenant-Colonel  Maun- 
SELL,  D.  A.  G.,  presented  Lieutenant  Harrison  with  the  North- 
West  medal  and  Lieutenant-Colonel  Irwin  handed  a  similar 
memento  to  Sergeant  Richardson,  who  had  been  promoted 
to  staff  sergeant.  The  result  of  the  inspection  was  that  No.  4 
battery  made  109  points  out  of  a  possible  129,  and  took  second 
place  in  the  general  efficiency  competition  though,  unfortunately, 
at  that  time  there  was  no  second  prize  among  garrison  bat- 
teries. After  inspection  a  dinner  was  given  at  the  Dufferin 
hotel  by  the  corps  to  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong  for  the 
celebration  of  the  victories  achieved  by  the  Shoeburyness  team. 
Major  Armstrong  presided  ;  on  his  right  sat  the  guest  of  the 
evening,  and  on  his  left  Lieutenant-Colonel  Maunsell,  D.  A.  G. 

It  was  soon  to  be  the  turn  of  the  gallant  major  to  be  honored 
at  festivities  of  a  similar  character.  He  would  himself  prob- 
ably say  that  the  greatest  honor  that  an  officer  can  receive 
is  one  paid  to  him  by  the  men  who  have  been  under  his 
command,  and  one  of  the  proudest  moments  of  his  hfe  was 
on  the  5th  November  when  at  a  supper  which  he  gave  to 
No.  4  battery,    his    old    command,    he   was    presented   with    a

beautifully  illuminated   address   and  a  handsome  walking  stick 
bearing  the  inscription  : — 

Presented  to 

Major  A.  J.  Armstrong, 

by  the 

Non-commissioned  Officers  and  Gunners 

No.  4  Battery,  N.  B.  B.  G.  A., 

1886. 

The  corps  was  not  destined  to  have  the  new  major  long  in 
the  saddle,  though  while  life  lasts  he  will  always  be  with  them 
in  spirit.  In  February  of  the  next  year  he  was  appointed  dis- 
trict storekeeper  for  the  Province  of  New  Brunswick,  and  his 
pleasant  companionship  with  the  corps  came  to  an  end  so  far 
as  the  militia  lists  can    testify. 

At   the   annual    meeting    of    officers  on    14th    March,   1887, 

a    vote    of   thanks    was    passed    to    Blair  Botsford,  Esq.,  of 

Dorchester,  N.  B.,  for    the    gift    of   a    valuable    challenge    cup 

which    has    since    been    competed    for   among  the  batteries  by 

the  non-commissioned  officers'   answers  to  questions.      In  case 

of  a  tie  it  is  decided  by  the  officers'  answers  to  their  questions. 

The  officers  also  passed  the  following  resolution  upon  the  death 

of  the  late  Brevet  Lieutenant-Colonel   Peters  which    occurred 

on  5th  February,   1887  : — 

Whereas,  The  late  Lieutenant-Colonel  Martin  Hunter 
Peters,  lately  in  command  of  this  corps,  has  departed  this 
life,  having  served  with  the  militia  volunteers  of  this  province 
for  a  period  of  over  forty  years  ;   therefore 

Resolved,  That  the  officers  of  the  New  Brunswick  Brigade 
Garrison  Artillery  do  hereby  place  on  record  their  feelings  of 
respect  and  esteem  for  the  late  Lieutenant-Colonel  Peters. 
Always  willing  to  devote  his  time,  attention  and  ability  to  the 
service  of  his  country,  and  in  aid  of  his  fellow  men,  he  at 
last  lost  his  life  in  the  commendable  effort  of  saving  his  neigh- 
bors' property  from  destruction  by  fire ;   and  further

Resolved^  That  a  copy  of  this  resolution  be  forwarded  to  the 
widow  of  the  late  Lieutenant-Colonel  Peters  with  the  sincere 
condolence  of  the  members  of  this  brigade. 

This  year  forms  another  landmark  for  the  St.  John  militia. 
It  being  the  Jubilee  year  of  Her  Majesty's  accession  to  the 
throne,  it  was  the  feeling  of  all  that  it  should  be  fittingly  cele- 
brated, and  this  feeling  was  naturally  very  strong  among  the 
militia.  Accordingly  a  grand  demonstration  was  planned  by 
the  city  force,  which  should  include  the  '  trooping  of  the  colors' 
a  ceremony  that  had  not  been  performed  in  St.  John  since 
the  departure  of  the  regular  troops.  The  21st  June  was  ob- 
served as  the  official  holiday,  and  at  2  p.  m.  on  that  day  were 
brigaded  under  Lieutenant-Colonel  Blaine,  the  artillery  com- 
manded by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong,  the  62nd  battalion 
under  Major  Tucker,  and  the  St.  John  Rifle  Company,  Cap- 
tain Hartt.  Major  Markham  of  the  8th  Princess  Louise  Regi- 
ment of  cavalry  acted  as  orderly  officer.  Arrived  at  the  Market 
Square  the  artillery  were  posted  on  the  south,  the  62nd  and  Rifle 
Company  on  the  north  while  the  ceremony  of  trooping  the  color 
was  performed.  The  artillery  then  took  up  their  position  on 
the  North  Wharf  and  a  feu  de  joie  was  fired  by  the  brigade, 
the  artillery  firing  seven  rounds  from  their  guns  three  times. 
The  brigade  then  marched  past  twice  and  after  several  man- 
oeuvres a  hollow  square  was  formed,  two  volleys  fired  and  the 
brigade  reformed  in  line  and  advanced  in  review  order.  Further 
detail  of  the  events  of  the  day  is  unnecessary.  Suffice  it  to  say 
that  on  all  hands  there  was  loud  praise  for  the  citizen  soldiery 
of  all  ranks,  and  that  all  did  their  best  to  honor  the  Sovereign 
whose  regnal  jubilee  was  a  festival  of  rejoicing  throughout  her 
mighty  empire. 

On    August    2 1  St    the    corps    attended    divine    service   at  St. 


178  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THfc: 

Stephen's  church,  where  an  excellent  address  was  given  by  Rev. 
Dr.  Macrae.  Inspection  took  place  on  the  following  day 
when  Lieutenant-Colonel  Irwin,  the  inspecting  officer,  handed 
to  Gunner  Edwards,  of  No.  3  battery,  a  gold  maltese  cross, 
the  gift  of  Lieutenant  Harrison,  for  attendance  at  drill.  In  the 
evening  there  was  a  regimental  dinner  at  the  Dufferin  hotel 
which  passed  off  with  all  the  pleasantness  usual  to  such  affairs. 
In  the  following  month  at  the  competition  at  the  Island  of 
Orleans  No.  4  battery  won  the  Montreal  Challenge  Cup  for 
highest  40-pr.  aggregate  from  twenty  competing  detachments. 
This  battery  was  again  second  in  general  efficiency,  though 
for  this  there  was  no  prize.     No.   i  took  fourth  place. 

At  the  annual  meeting  held  i8th  March  of  the  succeeding 
year  it  became  the  sad  duty  of  the  officers  to  again  record  the 
passing  away  of  another  who  had  lately  been  associated  with 
the  corps.  The  death  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster  was  the 
subject  of  the  following  resolutions  : 

Whereas,  On  the  20th  December  last,  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Stephen  Kent  Foster  departed  this  life,  full  of  years  and  in 
the  enjoyment  to  the  greatest  extent  of  the  respect  and  esteem 
of  the  public ;   and 

Whereas,  Colonel  Foster  was  appointed  lieutenant  in  the 
corps  April  26th,  1834;  captain,  March  31st,  1841;  major, 
August  14th,  1848;  lieutenant-colonel,  December  6th  1859,  re- 
tiring in  1884;  and  thus  served  as  an  officer  of  the  corps 
continuously  for  the  exceptionally  long  period  of  half  a  century, 
and  was  for  twenty-five  years  of  this  period  its  commanding 
officer ;  therefore 

Resolved,  That  we,  the  officers  of  the  N.  B.  B.  G.  A.,  here- 
by express  our  appreciation  of  the  personal  worth  of  our  late 
commander,  and  our  admiration  of  his  untiring  zeal,  and  the 
ability  he  displayed  in  keeping  his  corps  in  a  condition  of 
strength  and  efficiency  for  so  many  years — no  small  achieve- 
ment, and  one  demanding  more  than  average  executive  powers  ;

nor  would  we  forget  those  pleasant  traits  of  disposition  which 
gained  for  him  the  affectionate  regard  of  the  officers  and  men 
under  his  command,  and  made  his  death  a  personal  loss  to 
so  many ;   and  further 

Resolved,  That  the  above  resolutions  be  entered  on  the  rec- 
ords of  the  brigade,  and  a  copy  sent  to  the  family  of  the  late 
Colonel   Foster. 

No.  2  battery,  under  Captain  Gordon,  developed  consider- 
able energy  this  year.  They  obtained  subscriptions  from  the 
citizens  for  the  erection  of  a  band  stand  on  the  Market  square, 
Carleton,  which  has  since  been  frequently  used  greatly  to  the 
pleasure  of  the  residents  of  that  side  of  the  harbor.  The  stand 
was  opened  on  the  evening  of  loth  July,  No.  2  battery,  headed 
by  the  Carleton  Serenade  Band,  marching  from  their  quarters 
to  the  square,  forming  a  circle  about  the  stand  and  firing  three 
volleys.  The  citizens,  by  subscription,  presented  a  silver  cup 
to  the  battery  which  has  since  been  annually  competed  for  on 
the  ist  July.  The  church  parade  was  held  on  19th  August, 
at  St.  John's  church.  Rev.  John  DeSoyres  officiating,  and  in- 
spection took  place  on  the  22nd  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Irwin. 
The  result  was  highly  satisfactory.  No.  i  battery  winning  the 
second  prize,  the  Lansdowne  cup,  for  general  efficiency,  with 
126  points  out  of  a  possible  148.  No.  4  battery  was  not  far 
behind,  taking  third  place  with  119  points.  At  the  Island  of 
Orleans,  Captain  Crawford,  of  No.  3,  won  the  officers'  first 
prize,  following  in  the  footsteps  of  his  colonel  who  had  won 
it  in  the  year  previous.  The  corps  gave  a  ball  on  28th  Sept- 
ember at  which  they  entertained  over  four  hundred  guests. 
The  affair  took  place  in  Berryman's  hall  and  no  labor  was 
spared  to  make  the  surroundings  as  attractive  as  possible.  The 
dance  was  popularly  voted  the  most  successful  of  society  events 
for  many  years,  and  the  brigade  was  much  encouraged  to  re- 
peat the  entertainment  in  subsequent  years. 


l8o  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

No.  2  battery  in  this  year  decided  to  build  a  drill  shed  for 
themselves  and  started  out  to  raise  the  funds  by  a  series  of 
concerts.  One  was  held  in  the  Carleton  City  Hall  on  Novem- 
ber 29th  at  which  a  good  programme  was  given.  Among  the 
principal  features  was  the  revival  of  the  old  'Chesapeake  and 
Shannon,'  which  has  since  been  the  marching  song  of  that 
battery. 

One  of  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong's  Christmas  boxes 
this  year  was  an  appointment  as  A.  D.  C.  to  His  Excellency 
the  Governor-General. 

In  February,  1889,  Captain  Seely  was  promoted  to  the 
majority,  and  in  the  following  May  Captain  Crawford  of  No. 
3  battery  was  transferred  to  No.  i  ;  Lieutenant  McLeod  being 
promoted  to  the  captaincy  of  No.  3.  Major  Seely  was  pre- 
sented with  a  handsome  gold  headed  cane  by  his  battery  upon 
his  promotion. 

The  winter  carnival,  held  on  27  th  February,  was  participated 
in  by  the  artillery  as  the  following  newspaper  extract  will  show : 

"To  the' artillery  belongs  the  honor  of  a  fine  historic  repre- 
sentation, and  to  Portland  battery  credit  must  be  given  for  a 
tableau  expressive  of  loyalty.  No.  i  and  No.  4  batteries  joined 
in  a  scene  illustrative  of  the  overland  journey  of  the  Imperial 
troops  in  1861,  when  all  England  and  America  were  excited 
over  the  seizure  by  the  latter  power  of  Mason  and  Seidell, 
the  Confederate  commissioners  to  England.  It  is  fresh  in  the 
recollection  of  many  persons  how  the  troops  were  hurried  out 
to  Canada  and  up  through  our  province  to  Quebec.  The 
transport  arrangements  of  the  home  authorities  were  well  imi- 
tated yesterday  by  the  artillery,  and  effective  scenes  were  pre- 
sented by  the  sledges  where  artillerymen  wrapped  in  their  great 
coats  were  seated  in  the  rough  and  ready  conveyances.  Follow- 
ing the  teams  with  the  men  were  other  teams  laden  with  field 
pieces,  wheels  and  limbers.  The  teams  had  the  mottoes,  '  Trent 
Affair,'  Riviere  du    Loup    'via  Nerepis,'   'via  Fredericton,'  'St. 


N     n.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  l8l 

John  the  winter  port  in  '6i,  why  not  '89?'  More  teams  fol- 
lowed laden  with  the  knapsacks  and  other  equipments  of  the 
men. 

No.  3's  show  was  really  fine.  On  arches  over  their  sledges  were 
the  mottoes  '  Long  live  Victoria '  and  '  Every  ready,'  besides 
others.  Under  a  canopy  stood  a  number  of  non-commissioned 
officers  and  men  in  full  uniform  with  fixed  swords.  At  the 
rear  of  the  sledge  was  a  brass  field  piece. 

The  display  was  fine  and  was  much  enhanced  by  the 
thought  that,  if  needed,  gallant  No.  3  would  stand  by  their 
motto  of  *  Ever  ready.'  The  whole  parade  of  the  artillery  was 
headed  by  a  sleigh  containing  Lieutenant-Colonel  J.  R.  Arm- 
strong, Major  A.  J.  Armstrong,  Surgeon  Daniel,  Captain 
G.  B.  Seely,  Captain  G.  W.  Jones,  Lieutenant  W.  W.  White. 

If  1887  was  distinctively  'Jubilee  Year,'  1889  was  Carnival 
year.  July  23rd  was  the  day  of  the  Summer  Carnival,  the  en- 
joyment of  which  was  much  enhanced  by  the  presence  in  port 
of  H.  M.  S.  'Jourmaline.  In  the  evening  a  brigade  was 
formed  under  Lieutenant-Colonel  Blaine  consisting  of  the 
blue  jackets  of  the  warship  with  their  field  pieces,  ,the  marines, 
artillery,  62tid,  and  rifle  company.  The  color  was  trooped  on 
the  Market  square,  and  the  marines  under  Lieutenant  Hen- 
derson, R.  M.  L.  I.,  performed  the  bayonet  exercise  with 
beautiful  precision.  The  blue  jackets,  under  Lieutenant  Bar- 
ton, R.  N.,  next  gave  an  exhibition  of  field  gun  drill  which 
drew  forth  the  applause  of  thousands  of  spectators.  The  bri- 
gade marched  past  in  column  and  quarter  column  and  returned 
to  the  drill  shed  where  Lieutenant-Colonel  Maunsell,  D.  A.  G., 
addressed  the  men. 

At  inspection  Corporal  Sullivan,  of  No.  3,  won  Lieutenant 
Harrison's  prize,  a  breast-pin,  for  best  attendance  at  drill  in 
his  battery.  No.  4  battery  secured  the  Botsford  cup.  The 
church  parade  was  held  at  St.  Luke's  church,  on  August  nth, 
Rev.  L.  G.  Stevens  preaching  the  sermon. 


1 82  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

The  next  year  the  brigade  sustained  a  severe  loss  by  the 
sudden  death  on  March  21st  of  Major  George  B.  Seely, 
who,  in  a  few  years  had  risen  to  the  second  position  in  the 
corps  and  was  respected  for  his  abiUty  and  kindHness  of  heart. 
Many  a  young  officer  was  encouraged  by  him,  and  many  an 
older  one  strengthened  by  his  wise  and  timely  advice.  With 
a  hopeful  career  before  him  at  the  bar  of  his  province,  his 
death  was  not  merely  a  loss  to  a  single  organization  but  to 
the  community.  When  but  a  lad  of  fifteen,  the  Fenian  trouble 
broke  out,  and  young  Seely,  then  a  member  of  a  school  cadet 
corps,  enlisted  in  a  company  of  York  county  miHtia  and  went 
to  the  front.  His  record  as  an  officer  in  the  corps  has  been 
already  told.  Owing  to  his  illness  being  of  a  contagious  nature 
the  funeral  was  private,  but  the  officers  of  the  brigade  followed 
the  hearse  to  the  railway  station  from  whence  the  body  was  taken 
to  Fredericton,  where  it  was  interred.  The  Infantry  School  corps 
there  preceded  the  hearse  and  as  the  body  of  Major  Seely  was 
laid  to  rest  by  the  side  of  his  father  three  volleys  paid  sorrow- 
ful tribute  to  the  departed.  His  death  cast  a  gloom  over  the 
annual  meeting  which  was  held  on  March  31st,  and  at  which  the 
following  resolutions  were  adopted  :— 

Whereas^  We  are  called  upon  to  mourn  the  loss  by  death 
of  Major  Geo.  B.  Seely,  of  this  corps ; 

Resolved,  That  we,  the  officers  of  the  N.  B.  B.  G.  A.,  place 
on  record  an  expression  of  our  deep  sorrow  and  regret  for  the 
loss  of  a  brother  officer,  who,  since  his  connection  with  this 
corps  in  1885  has  taken  the  greatest  interest  in  it,  and  has 
been  both  a  strength  and  an  ornament  thereto. 

As  a  battery  officer  he  was  not  only  respected  and  beloved 
by  his  men,  but  by  his  painstaking  attention  to  his  military 
duties,  indefatigable  zeal  and  honorable  ambition  to  place  his 
command  at  the  head  of  the  list,  he  succeeded  in  gaining  for  No.  i 
i)attery  a  position  for  efficiency  which    was   second  to  but   one 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 83 

in  the  whole  artillery  of  Canada.  As  a  member  of  the  regimental 
committee  his  cool,  clear  judgment  was  invaluable,  and  he  was 
ever  ready  and  willing  to  give  to  its  deliberations  the  benefit 
of  his  presence  and  advice. 

We  admired  him  for  his  manly  bearing,  his  intellectual 
ability,  his  firm  integrity  and  his  patriotism;  we  loved  him  for 
his  constant  courtesy,   his    fidelity  and  his  kindness  of  heart. 

Resolved,  That  we  send  a  copy  of  the  foregoing  resolutions 
to  his  widowed  mother,  to  whom  we  would  also  most  respect- 
fully extend  our  warmest  sympathy  in  her  deep  affliction. 

In  that  year  the  brigade  obtained  from  the  city  of  St.  John 
two  lots  of  land  on  Winslow  street,  Carleton,  for  the  erection 
of  a  drill  shed.  The  corps  during  the  year  built  a  shed  on 
Fort  Howe  for  No.  3  battery  at  a  cost  of  about  $1000,  of 
which  only  $250  was  contributed  by  the  government.  A  man- 
ual of  rifle  and  artillery  exercises  was  published  by  the  corps, 
the  work  being  compiled  by  Captain  Langan  and  Lieutenant 
Baxter.  Church  parade  was  again  held  at  St.  John's  church, 
and  the  sermon  preached  by  Rev.  John  DeSoyres,  the  rector. 
Inspection  was  held  on  August  28th,  and  on  the  29th  the 
officers  entertained  Lieutenant-Colonel  Irwin  at  dinner  at  the 
Dufiferin  hotel.  No.  i  battery  was  successful  in  winning  the 
Botsford  cup,  and  the  event  was  duly  celebrated  by  a  supper 
given  by  its  officers  to  the  battery  on  the  evening  of  Septem- 
ber 8th.  In  the  fall  of  this  year  His  Excellency  the  Governor- 
General  and  Lady  Stanley  of  Preston  visited  the  city.  A 
salute  was  fired  from  Fort  Howe  on  the  arrival  of  the  train. 
On  the  1 8th  December  the  death  occurred  of  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Jago  to  whom  frequent  reference  has  before  been  made  in 
these  pages. 

In  1 89 1  the  corps  provided  a  drill  shed  for  Carleton  battery 
which  however  was  not  completed  in  time  for  occupation  for 
the  purposes  of  that  year's  drill.     The  cost  was  $1200,  of  which 


1 84  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

the  government  gave  the  small  grant  of  $250.  At  the  annual 
church  parade  to  St.  John's  church  on  August  30th,  a  number  of 
the  officers  of  H.  M.  S.  Tourmalme,  which  was  again  in  port,  ac- 
companied the  staff  of  the  brigade.  Rev.  G.  E.  Lloyd,  formerly 
chaplain  of  the  Queen's  Own  Rifles,  preached  the  sermon.  On 
September  2nd  the  bluejackets  of  the  Tourmaline  joined  with 
the  artillery  and  62nd  in  another  demonstration  which  was  quite 
as  successful  as  the  one  previously  mentioned.  After  the  par- 
ade the  men  of  the  several  corps  were  entertained  at  the  drill 
shed  by  His  Worship  Mayor  Peters. 

The  inspection  by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Montizambert  re- 
sulted in  No.  I  battery  winning  third  prize,  $25,  in  the  general 
efficiency  with  247  out  of  a  possible  260  points.  The  Botsford 
cup  was  also  won  by  this  very  efficient  battery. 

Another  brilliant  event  in  the  social  history  of  the  corps  was 
the  ball  held  in  the  assembly  rooms  of  the  Mechanics'  Insti- 
tute, on  April  30th  following.  The  brigade  again  entertained 
some  hundreds  of  their  friends.  Among  those  invited  were  the 
officers  of  Infantry  School  Corps,  Fredericton ;  8th  Cavalry, 
Halifax  Garrison  Artillery;  Brighton  Engineers;  66th  P.  L.  F., 
Halifax;  62nd,  66th,  71st  and  74th  Battalions,  and  the  St.  John 
Rifle  Company.  This  year's  inspection  found  both  Nos.  i 
and  4  in  the  third  place  with  244  points  each.  They  divided 
the  prize.  No.  4  was  the  winner  of  the  Botsford  cup.  All  ol 
the  city  corps  attended  service  on  the  same  day,  August  21st. 
A  brigade  was  formed  which  was  afterwards  separated,  the 
artillery  going  to  St.  John's  church  and  the  62nd  and  Rifle 
company  to  the  Mission  church.  The  vacant  majority  was 
filled  on  1 6th  December  by  the  promotion  of  Captain  Gordon, 
of  No.  2  battery,  who  was  succeeded  in  the  command  of  the 
battery  by  Lieutenant  Baxter.     On  New  Year's  day,  1893,  the 


N.    P..    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 85 

new  major  received  a  testimonial  of  the  esteem  in  which  he  was 
held  by  his  old  command.  At  the  'At  Home'  given  by  the  band, 
Captain  Baxter  read  an  address  from  the  battery  and  presented 
Major  Gordon  with  a  neat  gold  headed  cane  suitably  inscribed. 
On  the  same  day  a  brief  historical  sketch  of  the  corps,  the 
precursor  of  this  volume,  was  published  in  the  Canadian  Mili- 
tary Gazette. 

The  Dominion  Artillery  Association  at  their  annual  meeting 
in  the  following  year  chose  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong  as 
their  president. 

At  the  regimental  meeting  on  March  27th,  1893,  the  follow- 
ing was  adopted  :  — 

'  Resolved^  That  the  ofificers  of  the  New  Brunswick  Brigade 
'of  Garrison  Artillery  desire  to  express  to  Lieutenant-Colonel 
'Arbuthnot  Blaine,  late  commanding  the  62nd  St.  John 
'  Fusiliers,  and  senior  officer  at  this  station,  upon  his  retire- 
'  ment  therefrom,  their  appreciation  of  his  long  and  successful 
'  work  in  the  militia  service,  and  their  sincere  hope  that  he 
'm^y  live  for  many  years  to  see  the  continued  prosperity  of 
'the  force  which  has  so  warm  a  place  in  his  heart.' 

It  was  also  resolved  to  celebrate  the  centenary  of  the  corps 
in  a  suitable  manner.  How  that  was  done  must  be  told  in 
another  chapter.

CHAPTER  XVII. 

The  Sergeant-Major  and  Non-Commissioned 
Officers. 


I^IGH  in  importance  among  the  elements  of  a  successful 
f/T  corps  are  the  non-commissioned  officers.  It  is  not 
necessary  to  repeat  the  trite  language  of  the  drill  books 
as  a  definition  of  their  duties.  No  mere  words  can  describe 
their  usefulness,  and  their  duties  can  only  be  learned  by  ex- 
perience and  common  sense.  Much  of  the  success  which  has 
attended  our  corps  in  the  past  and  a  great  measure  of  its 
present  strength  lies  in  the  ability  and  good  judgment  of  the 
men  who  wear  the  stripes.  Under  the  present  excellent  sys- 
tem, which  requires  each  non-commissioned  officer  to  answer 
a  number  of  questions  each  year  ensuring  some  theoretical 
knowledge  on  their  part,  and  by  the  judicious  selections  for 
appointment  which  have  been  made  in  all  the  companies,  the 
efficiency  of  the  non-commissioned  officers  has  been  maintained. 
Too  much  importance  cannot  be  attached  to  the  manner  in 
which  a  recruit  receives  his  first  instruction,  and  as  this  is 
generally  given  by  a  sergeant  or  corporal,  their  ranks  should 
be  held  in  high  regard.  An  excellent  feature  of  the  regiment 
is  that  many  of  its  officers  have  served  in  the  ranks  and  are, 
by  practice,  well  acquainted  with  the  adaptation  of  drill  to  the 
needs  of  the  soldier  and  the  service. 

Among    the    non-commissioned    officers  of  the  regiment  the 
Sergeant-Major  is  of  course  chief  in  rank,  but    more  than  that 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 87 

he  is  first  in  the  affections  both  of  officers  and  men.  His 
connection  with  our  force  dates  from  1862  when  he  came  to 
St.  John  from  Hahfax  in  the  gunboat  Spiteful.  Sergeant-Major 
Samuel  Hughes  was  then  in  "K"  battery,  4th  brigade,  R.  A., 
under  Captain  Strangways,  and  at  St.  John  was  with  his  bat- 
tery transferred  to  Captain  Morris'  "A"  battery,  8th  brigade. 
He  arrived  in  St.  John  October  31st,  1862,  and  for  thirty- three 
years  has  been  a 'resident  of  the  city.  For  some  years  he  was 
occasionally  detailed  to  give  instruction  to  the  local  batteries  in 
field  gun  drill,  and  in  1866  on  the  strong  representation  of  Major 
Jago  was  transferred  to  the  N.  B.  Regiment  of  Artillery,  being 
at  the  same  time  placed  on  the  Coast  Guard,  R.  A.,  as  brigade 
sergeant-major.  The  latter  step  gave  him  a  permanent  rank  in 
the  Imperial  force,  while  in  the  militia  artillery  he  became 
regimental  sergeant-major.  Since  that  time  his  service  has  been 
constant.  Many  officers  of  our  corps  since  that  time  have 
passed  through  his  hands  for  instruction,  and  hundreds  of 
recruits  have  been  by  him  initiated  into  the  mysteries  of  drill. 
With  the  right  siege  train  at  Sebastopol  he  took  part  in  four  bom- 
bardments, was  wounded  on  6th  June  and  7th  September,  1855, 
being  present  at  the  fall  of  the  great  fortress,  and  proudly  wears 
the  reward  of  his  services  in  the  Crimean  medals.  Every  offi- 
cer and  man  of  the  corps  will  join  in  saying  that  the  tokens 
of  honor  were  never  displayed  on  a  braver  or  more  faithful 
breast.  Sergeant-Major  Hughes  was  born  at  Porthywayne, 
Shropshire,  on  the  borders  of  Wales,  on  25th  July,  1835,  ^"^ 
has  therefore  recently  completed  his  sixtieth  year.  May  he 
many  times  again  appear  on  parade  with  the  corps  for  which 
he  has  worked  so  strenuously  and  which  is  so  greatly  indebted 
to  him. 

A  quarter  of  a  century  ago  he  was  held   in  such  esteem  by 


1 88  HISTORICAL  rp:cords  of  the 

the  corps,  that,  at  a  parade  in  Merritt's  building,  he  was  pre- 
sented by  the  brigade,  through  Lieutenant-Colonel  Foster, 
with  a  handsome  gold  watch,  bearing  the  following  inscription : 

'•Presented  to 

Sergeant-Major  S.  Hughes,  R.   A., 

by  the  officers,  non-commissioned  officers  and  gunners  of 

Batteries   i,  2,  3,  10,  N.  B.  B.  Garrison  Artillery, 

Dominion  of  Canada,  January  27th,  1870." 

The  following  address  accompanied  the  gift : 

New  Brunswick  Brigade  of  Garrison  Artillery, 

Headquarters,  St.  John,  N.  B., 
Dominion  of  Canada,  January  27,  1870. 

Sergeant-Major  Hughes,  R.  A.  : 

The  staff  officers  of  the  brigade,  and  the  officers,  non-com- 
missioned officers  and  gunners  of  batteries  Nos.  i,  2,  3  and 
10,  under  the  respective  commands  of  Major  George  H. 
Pick,  Major  M.  H.  Peters,  Major  R.  Farmer  and  Captain 
John  Kerr,  have  great  pleasure  in  recording  their  unanimous 
approval  of  the  faithful  and  efficient  manner  in  which  you  have 
discharged  the  duty  of  your  position  of  drill  instructor  to  this 
portion  of  the  brigade,  from  the  date  of  your  appointment  in 
September,   1863,  to  the  present  time. 

On  several  occasions  during  that  period  the  batteries  were 
inspected  by  Major-General  Sir  H.  Doyle,  and  other  govern- 
ment officers  of  Her  Majesty's  Service,  all  of  whom  bestowed 
the  highest  encomiums  on  the  practical  results  of  your  tuition. 

As  drill  instructor  to  the  corps,  your  ability  and  happy  man- 
ner of  imparting  knowledge,  have  secured  our  fullest  confidence, 
and  as  a  man,  your  exemplary  conduct  has  won  our  highest 
respect  and  esteem. 

As  a  small  token  of  our  friendship  we  ask  you  to  accept 
this  gold  watch  and  chain  ;  and  our  best  wishes  for  your  future 
happiness  and  prosperity.

Lieutenant-Colonel  commanding. 


Sergeant-Major  Hughes.

Sergeant  Hughes  responded  as  follows : 

Lieu  tenant- Colon  el  Foster  and   Staff  Officers   of  the    Brigade  of 
Garrison  Artillery  of  N'e^v  Brunswick : 

Majors  Pick,  Peters  and  Farmer,  and  Captain  Kerr,  to- 
gether with  the  respective  non-commissioned  officers  and  gunners 
under  their  respective  commands,  having  declared  through  you 
their  approval  of  the  manner  in  which  I  have  discharged  my 
duty  as  drill  instructor,  and  also  referred  to  the  flattering  re- 
marks made  on  several  occasions  by  General  Sir  C.  Hast- 
ings Doyle  in  reference  to  the  high  state  of  discipline  which 
you  have  acquired,  nothing,  sir,  can  possibly  be  more  gratify- 
ing to  the  British  soldier  than  to  know  his  humble  services 
have  met  with  the  approbation  of  his  commanding  and  other 
officers,  also  the  non-commissioned  officers  and  gunners  of  the 
portion  of  the  service  to  which  he  belongs.  And  with  reference 
to  the  discipline  of  these  batteries,  I  have  only  to  state  that 
when  I  consider  the  facilities  granted  by  my  officers  and  the 
untiring  zeal  and  determination  of  the  non-commissioned  officers 
and  gunners  to  approach  as  near  as  possible  the  perfection  of 
Her  Majesty's  artillery  of  the  regular  army,  that  had  we  failed 
to  elicit  favorable  remarks  from  Sir  C.  Hastings  Doyle,  I 
would  have  decidedly  looked  upon  myself,  and  myself  alone, 
as  the  person  to  blame  ;  but  I  have  also  to  add  the  testimony 
of  a  gentleman  of  long  military  experience,  and  who  has  wit- 
nessed the  manavuring  of  volunteers  in  different  parts  of  the 
several  provinces  in  our  Dominion,  that  the  artillery  to  which 
we  have  the  honor  to  belong  will  bear  favorable  comparison 
with  those  he  has  seen  in  other  places. 

And  with  reference  to  the  gold  watch  and  chain  -  a  token 
of  your  kindness  to  me,  which  I  neither  expected  nor  deserved 
— a  present  which,  notwithstanding  its  great  value,  shall  be 
prized  by  me  as  a  great  treasure,  chiefly  as  a  memento  of  the 
happy  years  I  have  spent  with  the  Volunteer  Artillery  of  St. 
John,  New  Brunswick,  and  for  which  I  can  only  return  you 
all  my  sincere  thanks. 

The  sergeant-major,  besides  his  other  decorations,  has  also 
received  the  medal  bestowed  for  long  service  and  good  conduct, 
one  of  the  proudest  emblems  which  a  soldier  can  display.     A

portion    of    the    period    of   service    for   which    this    medal  was 
granted  was   spent  in  the  regiment. 

Though  the  corps  did  not  directly  contribute  to  the  force 
engaged  in  the  suppression  of  the  rebellion  in  the  North-West, 
yet,  as  before  mentioned,  one  officer,  Captain  Harrison,  saw- 
service,  though  before  he  was  connected  with  the  brigade.  The 
corps  had  another  representative  in  the  field  in  the  person  of 
Corporal  Thomas  Richardson  of  No.  4  battery,  who,  while 
attending  a  short  course  at  "A"  battery,  Quebec,  volunteered 
and  went  to  the  front.  He  served  in  the  engagements  at  Fish 
Creek  and  Batoche.  Upon  his  return  he  was  banquetted  at  the 
Clarendon  Hotel  by  his  comrades  of  No.  4,  and  was  presented 
by  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong  with  a  handsome  meerschaum 
pipe,  on  the  silver  ferrule  of  which  the  names  of  the  battles 
were  engraved.  The  pipe  was  the  gift  of  No.  4  Battery,  and 
was  accepted  by  the  recipient  with  modest  thanks.

The   Band. 

The  Music,  of  the  Corps  and  Its  Makers — Formation  of  the  Band — 
What  Has  Been  Done  and  Who  Have  Done  It — Present  Member- 
ship.   

^"^HE  Artillery  band  has  become  such  a  leading  organization 
Vy  among  the  musical  circles  of  Saint  John,  that  in  a  his- 
tory  of  the  corps  it  requires  to  be  dealt  with  by  itself. 
Of  course,  like  the  rest  of  the  regiment,  much  of  its  work  is 
of  a  routine  character  which  would  be  very  dry  reading,  but, 
nevertheless,  it  has  been  the  patient  performance  of  just  such 
routine  work  which  has  enabled  the  band  to  occupy  the  same 
relative  position  among  other  bands  as  the  corps  does  among 
other  corps,  and  that  is,  be  it  modestly  said,  a  high  one  for 
efficiency.  Prior  to  1885  the  artillery  had  to  depend  upon  hiring 
the  services  of  civilian  bands  or  at  times  to  rely  on  such  a 
fife  and  drum  organization  as  could  be  got  together.  The  lat- 
ter was  at  times  very  good  while  at  other  periods  probably  the 
less  said  about  it  the  better.  Upon  the  present  lieutenant- 
colonel  assuming  command  it  was  decided  to  bring  the  musi- 
cal department  into  line  with  the  other  work  of  the  corps,  and, 
by  great  good  fortune,  the  brigade  possessed  the  right  man  to 
do  it.  He  was  soon  put  in  the  right  place  and  to  Captain 
S.  D.  Crawford,  for  many  years  president  of  the  band  com- 
mittee, is  almost  entirely  due  the  great  success  with  which  the 
band  has  met  and  the  steady  increase  in  its  efificiency.  Nor 
has  his  task  been  unattended  with  difificulty  for  the  selection 
and  maintenance  of  an  efficient  musical  organization  is  prob- 
ably one  of  the  most  difficult  tasks  which    can  be  undertaken. 


192  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

The  right  man  must  be  selected  and  the  tuition  must  be  care- 
fully watched.  Engagements  for  the  services  of  the  band  have 
to  be  made  with  a  due  regard  to  the  interests  of  the  corps 
and  with  consideration  for  the  fact  that  almost  every  engage- 
ment takes  at  least  a  portion  of  the  men  from  their  daily 
vocations.  All  of  these  things  have  been  well  and  carefully 
done  and  the  corps  appreciates  the  fact  that  the  success  is 
due  to  the  enthusiasm  and  untiring  energy  of  the  president  of 
the  band  committee.  In  1885  there  existed  what  was  known 
as  the  City  Brass  Band.  They  were  unpretentious  musicians 
but  anxious  for  improvement,  and  for  a  chance  to  show  what 
they  could  do  under  favorable  conditions.  Negotiations  were 
carried  on  for  some  time  which  resulted  in  the  appearance  of 
the  band  in  the  uniform  of  the  corps,  on  October  ist,  1885. 
Three  days  later  the  band  accompanied  the  brigade  to  divine 
service.  The  leader  was  Michael  Madigan,  a  veteran  of  the 
Crimean  war.     The  men  enrolled  were  : — 

James  Holman,  Albert  Burgess, 

Charles  H.  Smith,  John  M.  Jenkins, 

Wm.  Duncan,  Wm.  Mitchell, 

Thos.  Duncan,  Samuel  Patterson, 

J.  A.   LiPSETT,  Albert  Watters, 

Joseph  Matthews,  A.  J.  Charlton, 

and  soon  afterwards  John  Tenfold,  Fred.  Meneley  and 
Fred.  W.  Amland  were  added  to  the  roll. 

At  the  inspection  of  1885  the  corps  had  music,  not,  per- 
haps, of  a  very  ambitious  character,  but  the  men  who  made 
it  were  bound  that  it  should  be  improved.  It  was  then  a 
difficult  matter  for  the  infant  band  to  obtain  engagements,  and 
Mr.  A.  B.  CoLWELL,  afterwards  an  enthusiastic  member  who 
contributed  an  excellent  newspaper  sketch  of  its  history,  is 
authority  for  the  statement  that  members  of  other  bands  would

(President    of   the    Band   Committee. 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 93 

not  give  their  assistance  even  for  pay.  In  the  next  year  Mr. 
CoLWELL  and  James  Sullivan  joined  the  band,  and  contrib- 
uted much  to  its  efficiency.  During  the  winter  of  1886  the 
band  was  instructed  by  M.  J.  Penfold,  of  the  Royal  Irish 
Rifles,  but  his  removal  to  Halifax,  after  a  few  months'  service, 
left  them  again  without  a  tutor.  The  corps  provided  a  set  of 
new  instruments  in  this  year,  and  near  its  close  Charles  H. 
Williams,  who  had  formerly  been  band  sergeant  on  H.  M.  S. 
Royal  Alfred^  was  engaged  as  bandmaster.  Under  his  tuition  they 
came  on  rapidly  and  were  emboldened  to  enter  the  lists  in  a 
band  competition  in  which  the  62nd  battalion  and  the  City 
Cornet  bands  took  part.  This  was  in  1887,  ^"^  the  tyros  re- 
ceived honorable  mention  from  the  judge,  Bandmaster  Coole, 
of  the  2nd  battalion  York  and  Lancaster  Regiment.  In  the 
previous  summer  the  boys  had  secured  an  engagement  with 
the  St.  John  firemen  who  visited  Halifax  to  participate  in  a 
tournament.  They  acquitted  themselves  so  creditably  that  the 
obtaining  of  engagements  became  no  longer  difficult.  Their 
progress  continued  in  the  right  direction  under  Mr.  Williams 
until,  in  1889,  it  was  felt  by  the  band  committee  that  the  ex- 
clusive services  of  a  bandmaster  were  required  for  so  good  an 
organization,  Mr.  Williams  being  instructor  for  three  city 
bands.  Mr.  J.  M.  White  then  took  up  the  baton  which  he 
wielded  until  the  end  of  the  year,  when  the  present  bandmaster, 
Thomas  W.  Horsman,  took  charge.  The  result  has  been 
surprising,  for  today  the  Artillery  band  acknowledges  no 
superior  in  the  Maritime  Provinces  and  possibly  the  field 
of  competition  might  be  more  extended.  Mr.  Horsman, 
who  was  born  in  Leeds,  England,  in  1857,  enrolled  as 
a  bandsman  in  the  2nd  battalion  Royal  West  Kent  Regi- 
ment when  but   14  years  of  age.     His  studies  on  the  baritone 


194  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

showed  such  proficiency  that  he  was  sent  by  the  officers  of  his 
reginnent  to  Kneller  Hall,  where  the  more  promising  musicians 
of  war  receive  their  education.  Here  he  spent  two  years  under 
instruction  and  was  made  the  euphonium  soloist  of  the  Hall. 
He  rejoined  his  regiment,  now  known  as  the  97th,  at  Bermuda, 
in  1874,  and  has  since  followed  its  fortunes  in  Halifax,  Gib- 
raltar and  South  Africa,  in  which  latter  place  it  was  stationed 
during  the  Boer  expedition  in  1879-80.  The  regiment  was 
then  sent  to  Dublin  where  the  subject  of  this  sketch  obtained 
his  discharge.  He  then  came  to  Halifax  and  played  in  the 
band  of  the  Halifax  Garrison  Artillery  and  that  of  the  63rd 
Rifles  until  he  removed  to  St.  John  to  take  charge  of  the  band 
of  this  corps.  Mr.  Horsman  volunteered  for  service  in  the 
North-West  campaign  and  went  to  the  front  as  a  sergeant  in 
No.  2  company  of  the  Halifax  Garrison  Artillery. 

It  may  be  said  of  our  bancT  that  since  its  formation  it  has 
shared  in  every  event  in  which  the  corps  has  taken  part.  In 
the  hours  of  gaiety  it  has  furnished  music  for  the  ballroom,  and 
in  those  of  mourning  its  strains  of  sorrow  have  expressed  the 
sentiments  of  the  regiment. 

The  whole  cost  of  maintaining  the  band  has  been  borne  by 
the  officers  of  the  corps  without  calling  on  the  public  for  any 
assistance.  The  present  set  of  instruments  is  worth  about 
$1500,  and  additions  in  number  and  value  are  yearly  being 
made. 

The  Christmas  season  of  1890  found  the  boys  so  jubilant 
over  their  successes  that  they  serenaded  many  of  the  officers 
of  the  corps.  They  also  acknowledged  the  arduous  work  done 
on  their  behalf  by  Captain  Crawford  by  presenting  him  with 
an  address    and    a   souvenir    of   the    occasion.     A  presentation 


N.    P..    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 95 

was  also  made  to  Bandmaster  Horsman,  evidencing  the  good 
feeling  which  then  and  ever  since  has  existed  between  him 
and  his  men. 

On  New  Year's  day,  1891,  the  band  held  an  "At  Home" 
in  their  rehearsal  rooms,  to  which,  besides  the  officers  and 
non-commissioned  officers  of  the  corps,  many  prominent  citizens 
and  friends  of  the  band  were  invited.  This  event  has  become 
a  custom,  which  was  unfortunately  interrupted  in  the  present 
year  because  of  the  death  of  a  near  relative  of  one  of  the 
bandsmen.  These  social  gatherings  have  always  been  of  an 
exceedingly  pleasant  nature  and  have  done  much  to  familiarize 
both  the  corps  and  the  public  with  the  personnel  and  work  of 
the  band. 

On  17th  May,  1892,  the  band,  under  the  auspices  of  the 
officers  of  the  corps  gave  a  concert  in  the  Opera  House,  St. 
John,  which  was  spoken  of  in  the  highest  terms.  On  this 
occasion  the  band  w^as  assisted  by  Mrs.  John  Black,  Miss 
PiDGEON  and  Mr.  A.  M.  F.  Custance,  three  well-known 
vocalists. 

The  band  paid  a  visit  to  Charlottetown,  P.  E.  I.,  in  July, 
where  they  entered  into  a  band  competition  and  were  awarded 
the  first  prize. 

Their  participation  in  the  celebration  of  the  centennial 
of  the  corps  appears  elsewhere  and  space  forbids  an  ex- 
tended notice  of  the  many  functions  in  which  they  have 
taken  part.  In  1895  they  added  a  new  feature  to  their  an- 
nual programme  by  giving  a  special  "At  Home  "  to  their  lady 
friends  on  February  4th,  which,  it  is  almost  needless  to  say, 
proved  a  most  enjoyable  affair.  The  present  membership  and 
instrumentation    of  the  band  is  as  follows  :

CHAPTER    XIX. 

The  Fortifications. 

TT  has  never  been    said    of   the  gunners   of   New  Brunswick 
I     that 

'They  lay  along  the  battery's  side, 

Beneath  the  smoking  cannon, — ' 

and,  therefore,  but  little  interest  is  attached  to  the  few  points 
where  guns  and  embrasures  denote  the  posts  of  the  artillery- 
man. Yet  some  of  the  fortifications  have  been  the  scene 
of  battles  and  others  have  been  beautified  by  the  magic  of 
romance.  At  St.  John,  within  a  radius  of  little  more  than  a 
mile,  are  three  points  of  interest,  one  of  which  recalls  the  days 
when  the  lilies  of  France  waved  over  Acadie ;  another,  the 
love  story  of  a  British  soldier  who  rose  from  the  ranks  to  a 
seat  in  his  country's  parliament ;  while  the  third  stands  as  a 
memorial  of  the  days  of  1812,  an  object  lesson  in  stone  of  the 
advance  of  the  science  of  war.  The  three  points  are  the  '  Old 
Fort,'  as  it  is  commonly  called,  or  Fort  LaTour;  Fort  Howe; 
T^nd  the  Martello  Tower  on  Lancaster  Heights.  Besides  these 
there  are  Dorchester  battery,  Red  Head  battery,  the  defences 
on  Partridge  Island  and  Fort  Dufferin. 

The  story  of  Fort  LaTour  is  one  of  tragic  interest.  Shortly 
before  the  Treaty  of  Saint  Germain  in  1632,  by  which  Acadie 
was  ceded  to  the  crown  of  France,  preparation  had  been  made 
by  that  country  for  taking  possession  of  the  territory.  Accord- 
ingly, about  1 63 1,  Charles  de  LaTour  commenced  building 
a  fort  at  the  mouth    of  the    Saint   John    river   on  the  western 


198  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

side  of  the  harbor,  on  a  small  neck  of  land  opposite  Navy 
Island.  This  fort  was  not  completed  until  about  1635.  It 
was  about  180  feet  square  and  was  palisaded.  Much  of  the 
material  for  the  construction  of  the  bastions  seems  to  have 
been  taken  from  what  is  now  the  channel  between  the  site  of 
the  fort  and  Navy  Island,  and  it  is  probable  that  the  channel 
was  widened  by  design  as  well  as  by  nature.  Prior  to  the 
completion  of  the  fort  LaTour  had  been  appointed  governor 
of  the  eastern  district  of  Acadie,  practically  comprising  Nova 
Scotia,  while  d'Aulnay  Charnisay  was  given  the  command 
over  the  western  district,  or  New  Brunswick  as  it  is  now  called. 
This  demarcation  of  boundaries  found  LaTour  with  a  large 
and  well  fortified  position  within  Charnisay's  territory,  while 
at  Port  Royal  Charnisay  held  an  equally  important  post  within 
the  jurisdiction  of  LaTour. 

Charnisay  displayed  the  utmost  jealousy  of  IvaTour  and 
assiduously  endeavored  to  undermine  his  influence  at  the  court 
of  France.  After  years  of  scheming  he  succeeded  and  was 
empowered  to  seize  both  LaTour  and  his  wife  and  send  them 
prisoners  to  France  upon  charges  of  treason.  He  made  several 
attempts  to  capture  the  fort  at  Saint  John  but  was  always  re- 
pulsed, LaTour  on  one  occasion  having  obtained  assistance 
from  Rochelle,  the  Huguenot  stronghold,  and  on  another  fromj,;; 
the  merchants  of  Boston.  But  he  was  not  always  destined  to 
be  so  fortunate.  During  his  absence  in  April,  1645,  when  the 
fort  was  commanded  by  Madame  LaTour  and  a  small  garrison, 
Charnisay  again  attacked  it.  The  garrison  led  by  the  noble 
woman  repulsed  the  invaders  and  they  drew  off  having  suffered 
considerable  loss.  But  treachery  accomplished  that  which  arms 
could  not  achieve.  A  Swiss  sentry  revealed  to  Charnisay  the 
weakness  of  the  fort  and    he    tried  a  land  attack.     Once  again 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  1 99 

the  gallant  lady  roused  the  defenders  and  inspired  them  by  an 
exhibition  of  her  personal  courage.  Charnisay  finding  himself 
again  in  danger  of  being  defeated,  proposed  honorable  terms 
of  surrender  for  the  capitulation  of  the  garrison.  Madame  I.a 
Tour  seeing  no  hope  of  the  siege  being  raised,  and  trusting 
the  word  of  a  soldier,  on  Easter  Sunday,  April  i6  of  that  year, 
opened  the  gates  to  the  victor,  who  gave  immediate  orders  that 
the  garrison  be  hanged,  sparing  the  lives  of  only  two,  Madame 
LaTour  and  a  soldier  who  consented  to  become  the  executioner 
of  the  others.  Broken  hearted  with  grief  the  noble  lady  died 
soon  afterwards  and  was  buried  somewhere  near  the  '  Old  Fort ' 
in  a  grave  that  is  unknown  today.  This  scene  of  heroism  was 
captured  by  the  British  under  Colonel  Monckton  in  1758,  and 
was  afterwards  known  as  '  Fort  Frederick.'  Mention  was  made 
of  it  in  the  first  chapter  when  the  defences  of  the  city  were 
strengthened  in  anticipation  of  a  French  invasion  in    1793. 

On  the  opposite  bank  of  the  river,  near  Rankine's  wharf, 
Charnisay  also  had  built  a  fort,  portions  of  w^hich  may  yet 
be  distinctly  traced.  While  excavating  for  a  sewer  a  few  years 
ago  the  workmen  found  a  number  of  cannon  balls  of  small 
cahbre. 

Fort  Howe,  situated  on  a  rocky  eminence  in  the  old  Parish 
of  Portland,  now  part  of  the  City  of  Saint  John,  was  garrisoned 
by  a  corps  under  Major  Guilford  Studholm  in  1777-78,  in 
consequence  of  a  threatened  revolt  of  the  Indian  tribes,  and 
was  for  many  years  the  chief  military  post  at  Saint  John.  In 
1784  Lieutenant-Colonel  Robert  Morse,  R.  E.,  reported  to 
Sir  Guy  Carleton,  general  and  commander-in-chief,  upon  this 
and  all  other  fortifications  in  the  Province  of  Nova  Scotia. 
The  report  is  published  in  the  Dominion  archives  for  1884, 
and  is  a  very  interesting  document.     Lieutenant-Colonel  Morse 


200  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF   THE 

was  not  greatly  impressed  with  the  utility  of  the  defences  at  this 
post  where,  he  thought,  too  little  land  had  been  reserved  for 
defensive  purposes.  The  fort  had  then  accommodation  for  12 
officers  and  100  soldiers.  It  was  armed  with  2  i8-pr.,  4  6-pr., 
and  2  4-pr.,  iron  guns  besides  2  5^-inch  brass  mortars.  This 
fort  was  abandoned  as  a  military  position  in  1821,  the  last 
regiment  stationed  there  being  the  74th  under  Lieutenant-Col- 
onel French.  The  ordnance  store  and  wharf  were  at  York 
Point,  the  store  houses  being  on  the  site  now  occupied  by 
Messrs.  Starr,  and  the  wharf  was  afterwards  called  Hare's 
wharf.  The  old  store  houses  still  standing  on  the  skirt  of  the 
hill  on  the  Rockland  road  were  the  married  officers,  quarters. 
The  brick  shoe  factory  on  Paradise  Row  opposite  the  mission 
church  of  St.  John  the  Baptist,  is  on  the  site  of  the  officers' 
mess.  The  '  King's  store  house,'  was  on  the  corner  of  Main 
and  Mill  streets,  while  the  '  Red  Store '  or  commissariat  was 
at  the  head  of  Long  wharf. 

The  romance  of  Fort  Howe  is  that  of  William  Cobbett, 
who  was  stationed  there  about  1783.  Cobbett  was  born  in 
1762  at  Farnham,  in  Surrey,  England,  and  was  a  field  laborer. 
He  became  a  soldier,  and  while  at  Fort  Howe  was  a  sergeant- 
major  of  infantry.  While  walking  out  with  some  companions 
early  on  a  winter's  morning  he  first  saw  his  future  wife,  who 
was  a  daughter  of  a  sergeant  of  artillery.  Four  years  afterwards, 
upon  obtaining  his  discharge,  Cobbett  was  married  to  the  girl 
whom  he  had  seen  on  that  winter's  morning  scrubbing  out  a 
washing  tub  on  the  snow  at  daybreak.  After  his  marriage  Cob- 
bett lived  for  some  time  in  France  studying  the  language. 
He  removed  to  Philadelphia,  where  he  compiled  a  French  and 
English  grammar.  After  remaining  in  the  United  States  for 
about  eight  years  he  returned  to  England,  where  he  established 


N      B     GARRISON    ARTILLERV.  20I 

a  considerable  reputation  as  the  author  of  'Rural  Rides,'  'Cot- 
tage Economy,'  the  'Protestant  Reformation,'  and  works  on 
America.  At  last,  after  the  passing  of  the  first  Reform  Bill 
in  1832,  he  was  elected  member  of  Parliament  for  Oldham. 
He  was  entirely  self-taught  and  thus  describes  the  conditions 
under  which  he  acquired  a  knowledge  of  grammar  : 

"  I  learned  grammar  when  I  was  a  private  soldier  on  the 
pay  of  sixpence  a  day.  The  edge  of  my  berth,  or  that  of  the 
guardbed,  was  my  seat  to  study  in  ;  my  knapsack  was  my 
bookcase  ;  a  bit  of  wood,  lying  on  my  lap,  was  my  writing 
table  ;  and  the  task  did  not  demand  anything  like  a  year  of 
my  life.  I  had  no  money  to  purchase  candle  or  oil  ;  in  winter 
time  it  was  barely  that  I  could  get  any  evening  light  but  that 
of  the  fire,  and  only  my  turn  even  of  that.  And  if  I,  under 
such  circumstances  and  without  parent  or  friend  to  advise  or 
encourage  me,  accomplished  this  undertaking,  what  excuse  can 
there  be  for  any  youth,  however  pressed  with  business,  or 
however  circumstanced  as  to  room  or  other  conveniences. 

To  buy  a  pen  or  sheet  of  paper  I  was  compelled  to  forego 
some  portion  of  food,  though  in  a  state  of  half-starvation.  I 
had  no  moment  of  time  that  I  could  call  my  own,  and  I  had 
to  read  and  to  write  amidst  the  talking,  laughing,  singing, 
whistling  and  brawling  of  at  least  half  a  score  of  the  most 
thoughtless  of  men.  and  that,  too,  in  their  hours  of  freedom 
from  all  control.  Think  not  lightly  of  the  farthing  that  I  had 
to  give,  now  and  then,  for  ink,  pen  or  paper.  That  farthing 
was,  alas  !  a  great  sum  to  me.  I  was  as  tall  as  I  am  now  ; 
I  had  great  health  and  great  exercise.  The  whole  of  the  money, 
not  expended  for  us  at  market,  was  twopence  a  week  for  each 
man.  I  remember — and  well  I  may,  that,  upon  one  occasion 
I,  after  all  absolutely  necessary  expenses,  had  on  a  Friday, 
made  a  shift  to  have  a  half-penny  in  reserve,  which  I  had 
destined  for  the  purchase  of  a  red  herring  in  the  morning;  but 
when  I  pulled  off  my  clothes  at  night,  so  hungry,  then,  as 
to  be  hardly  able  to  endure  life,  I  found  that  I  had  lost  my 
half-penny  !  I  buried  my  head  under  my  miserable  sheet  and 
rug,  and  cried  like  a  child  I 

And  again,  I  say,  if  I,  under  circumstances  like  these  could 


202  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

encounter  and  overcome  this  task,  is  there,  can  there  be  in  the 
whole  world,  a  youth  who  can  find  an  excuse  for  the  non-perfor- 
mance ?  What  youth,  who  shall  read  this,  will  not  be  ashamed 
to  say,  that  he  is  not  able  to  find  time  and  opportunity  for 
this  most  essential  of  all  the  branches  of  book-learning?" 

A  newspaper  item  in  the  year  1800  refers  to  the  arrival  of 
CoBBETT  at  Halifax  on  the  6tb  June  on  his  way  from  New 
York  to  England,  and  suggests,  with  bated  breath,  that  he  was 
*  said  to  have  dined  with  the  Duke  of  Kent.'  The  item  also 
tells  that  he  had  landed  before  in  Halifax  as  a  'simple  corporal' 

The  Martello  Tower  on  Lancaster  Heights  is  of  the  same 
character  of  defensive  work  as  the  towers  at  Quebec.  On  a 
height  between  two  and  three  hundred  feet  above  the  sea  level 
it  is  an  imposing  object  and  looks  as  though  it  should  have  a 
more  thrilling  history  than  that  which  it  possesses.  Its  build- 
ing was  begun  in  1800  and  was  not  finished  until  1813. 
Nearly  all  the  stone  used  in  its  construction  was  carried  by 
soldiers  on  hand  barrows  from  the  sea  beach,  half  a  mile 
away,  through  a  forest  and  up  a  steep  hill  to  its  site.  Hun- 
dreds of  men  must  have  toiled  at  the  making  of  the  old  tower, 
which  was  probably  impregnable  in  those  days  but  which  could 
not  long  withstand  the  Palliser  shot  and  the  armour  piercing 
projectiles  of  modern  days.  It  was  originally  mounted  with 
four  48-pr.  and  two  24-pr.  guns  but  for  many  years  the  arma- 
ment was  reduced  to  two  33-pr.  carronades.  During  the  Fenian 
scare  in  1866  the  roof  was  taken  off  and  guns  were  mounted, 
but  they  have  long  since  been  removed.  Opposite  the  tower 
on  the  adjacent  hill  there  used  to  be  a  wooden  block  house 
the  main  portion  of  which  was  raised  some  distance  from  the 
ground.  It  had  accommodation  for  forty  men,  and  was  called 
Fort  Drummond.  It  fell  into  decay  and  was  torn  down  some 
years    ago.      It    has    often    been   proposed    that    the  old  tower 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  203 

should  be  razed  and  a  modern  fortification  substituted  for  it 
►upon  the  commanding  height.  The  suggestions  have  even 
gone  so  far  as  to  include  a  Royal  School  of  Artillery  stationed 
there,  but  desirable  as  that  may  be  to  the  people  of  St.  John 
the  removal  of  the  historic  sentinel  of  the  past  would  be  dep- 
recated by  all  who  feel  an  interest  in  the  days  and  things  of 
old.  Should  the  old  fabric  ever  be  removed,  however,  its 
memory  will  be  perpetuated  in  the  following  admirable  lines, 
which,  by  special  permission  of  their  author,  Patrick  Mc- 
Carthy, Esq.,  alderman  of  the  city  of  St.  John,  are  here  re- 
produced : — 

THE  MARTELLO  TOWER. 


Upon  a  craggy  crest 
Proudly  it  stands. 
Its  profile  outlined  'gainst  the  azure  arch 
Of  Heaven's  dome ;  right  regally  it  bears 
The  footmarks  of  Decay's  destructive  march ; 
Still  solid  as  the  cliff  wherefrom  it  rears 

Its  rough  hewn,  stony  breast 
In  circling  bands 
Of  masonry,  that  brave  the  gales  of  Time 
Which  round  its  tap'ring   sides  so  fiercely  bellow  ; 
And  veils  of  fog  and  shrouds  of  icy  rime 
Have  left  few  tarnishings  on  stone  or  Hme, 

About  the  old  Martello. 

Massive  the  noble  tower 
Seems  to  the  sight, 
Suggesting  foemen  fierce,  and   siege  and  death 
And  kindred  horrors  of  grim,  gory,  fray  ; 


204  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

It  sentinels  the  broad    expanse  beneath 
Of  city,  river,  harbor,  beach  and  bay. 

And  in  unconscious  power 
Looms  on  the  height, 
A  grand  memorial'  of  the  years  bygone, 
Which  has  with  age,  like  olden  wine,  grown  mellow  ; 
It  now  keeps  ward  ungarrisoned  upon 
The  sunny  slopes  that  garnish  West  Saint  John, 

Around  the  old  Martello. 

It  recks  not  of  the  chill, 
Weird,  winter  storm, 
That  plays  against  its  eaves  as  seasons  roll 
Into  the  past ;  nor  spring's  delicious  breeze 
Which  sighs   on  bursting  buds,  and  wakes  man's  soul 
To  joy  ;  nor  summer  sun,  which  ghnts  the  trees, 

And  gilds  the  purling  rill 
With  lustrous  charm ; 
Nor  autumn's  breath,  which  turns  the  purest  green 
Of  nature's  costume  to  the  "  sere  and  yellow  ;" 
Ah !  well  has  it  withstood  climatic  spleen  ; 
The  weather's  shocks  as  yet  almost  unseen 

Upon  the  old  Martello. 

Stately  upon  the  site 
It  meets  the  gaze ; 
Its  rubble  wall  a  softened,  brownish  grey  ; 
A  sturdy  structure  of  that  by-past  age 
Which  now,  thank  God,  has  pass'd  for  aye  away ; 
Much  better  work  have  we  than  war  to  wage.

When  strangers  meet  as  once  met  only  friends, 
And  each  gives  kindly  greeting  to  his  fellow ; 
And  Peace,  with  her  twin  sister,  Learning  tends 
For  ancient  hate  of  race  to  make  amends, 
Beneath  the  old  Martello. 

The  Imperial  barracks  used  to  be  on  the  ground  at  Lower 
Cove  now  occupied  by  the  drill  shed  and  as  a  parade  ground. 
They  were  erected  about  1819-20,  and  were  destroyed  in  the 
fire  .of  1877  with  the  exception  of  two  stone  buildings  on  Sid- 
ney street  which  still  remain. 

About  1812-13  ^  wooden  block  house  was  erected  on  King 
street,  east,  at  the  intersection  of  Wentworth  street.  Traverses 
were  also  cut  in  the  solid  rock  for  a  two  gun  battery,  but 
when  the  level  of  King  street  was  reduced  some  years  ago  all 
trace  disappeared  of  the  eminence  on  which  the  block  house 
and  battery  stood. 

Besides  these  there  were  four  batteries  on  the  line  of  the 
shore  of  the  harbor  and  Courtenay  Bay,  called  the  'Graveyard  bat- 
tery,' 'Southern  battery,'  'Blockhouse  battery,'  and  the  'Eastern 
battery,'  or  'Fort  Johnston'  on  Pitt  street,  fronting  on  Courtenay 
Bay.  It  is  difficult  at  the  present  time  to  get  any  authentic 
account  of  the  building  of  these  batteries.  General  opinion 
places  the  time  of  erection  about  the  commencement  of  the 
war  of  181 2,  with  the  exception  of  the  battery  at  the  foot  of 
Sidney  street,  called  the  'Southern  battery.'  In  the  newspaper 
account  of  the  arrival  of  Prince  Edward,  Duke  of  "Kent, 
in  1794,  quoted  in  the  second  chapter,  it  is  stated  that  a  royal 
salute  was  fired  from  '  Dorchester  battery.'  This  name  has  always 
been  applied  to  the  Barrack  batteries  and  it  is  probable  that 
the  'Southern  battery'  is  the  oldest  of  the  fortifications  on  the 


2o6  HISTORICAL   RECORDS    OF   THE 

Barrack  grounds.  The  reminiscences  of  James  Bustin  given 
in  the  third  chapter  are  interesting  in  this  connection. 

The  fort  at  Red  Head  was  constructed  in  1863  and  1864. 
It  is  a  spacious  work,  and  if  mounted  with  modern  ordnance 
would  be  ail  effective  defence  to  the  harbor.  The  large  bat- 
tery at  Negrotown  Point,  now  known  as  Fort  Dufferin  was  also 
constructed  before  Confederation.  It  received  its  present  arm- 
ament in  1877,  and  is  the  battery  used  for  shell  practice  when 
competition  is  held  at  local  headquarters.  Within  a  few  years 
the  guns  and  carriages  at  Partridge  Island  have  been  removed 
to  the  ordnance  yard,  and  there  is  at  present  no  armament  at 
this  station. 

One  other  fortification  has  been  mentioned  in  the  chapter 
which  treats  of  the  Fenian  scare.  It  Js  called  '  Fort  Tipper- 
ary,'  and  is  situated  at  St.  Andrews,  commanding  the  harbor 
of  that  town.  The  armament  is  not  extensive,  and  since  the 
cessation  of  artillery  work  at  that  place  but  little  attention  has 
been  given  to  it.

•JfS  the  centennial  year  would  begin  very  early  in  the  drill 

V-1      season  it  was  not  thought  to  be  advisable  to  have  any 

military  demonstration  upon  the  4th  May,  but  the  firing 

of  a  salute  of  one  hundred  guns,  for  which  authority  was  sought 

and  obtained.     At  this,  the  first  day  of  the  second  century  of 

the  corps,  the  officers  were : 

Lieu fena?it- Colonel,  John  Russell  Armstrong. 
Major,  John  James  Gordon.

The  names  of  the  men  who  composed  the  corps  during  the 
year,  as  taken  from  the  pay  Hsts,  are  given  in  an  appendix. 

Before  the  hundredth  anniversary  was  reached  the  name  of 
the  corps  was  changed,  the  estabHshment  Hsts  making  it  the 
'New  Brunswick  BattaHon  of  Garrison  Artillery.'  However 
technically  correct  the  new  designation  may  have  been  con- 
sidered, it  did  not  find  favor  with  the  corps,  nor  was  the 
change  from  '  batteries '  to  '  companies '  thought  to  be  either 
euphonious  or  necessary. 

It  was  arranged  that  the  salute  should  be  fired  from  Dor- 
chester battery,  Fort  Dufferin,  Martello  Tower  and  Fort  Howe. 
At  sunrise  the  Union  Jack  was  floating  above  the  forts  and 
soon  after  some  of  the  men  were  on  hand  eager  to  participate 
in  the  celebration.  Some  mischievous  persons  had  spiked  the 
vent  of  the  gun  at  Martello  Tower  and  an  attempt  was  made 
to  put  the  guns  at  Fort  Howe  out  of  service,  which  was  partly 
successful,  only  one  gun  being  capable  of  use.  Punctually  at 
nine  o'clock  the  salute  began.  No.  2  firing  the  first  gun  from 
Fort  Dufferin.  In  twenty  minutes  the  salute  was  over  and  the 
smoke  as  of  battle  hung  in  wreaths  over  the  historic  heights  of 
the  city.  The  following  are  the  officers,  non-commissioned " 
officers  and  men  who  took  part  in  the  saluting  : 

Lieutenant- Colonel  Armstrong,    Major  Gordon.

In  the  evening  despite  unfavorable  weather  the  old  Mechanics' 
Institute  was  filled  to  the  doors  for  the  centennial  concert 
given  by  the  band  of  the  corps,  assisted  by  Mrs.  C.  W.  Har- 
rison, (Sackville),  Mr.  Gershon  S.  Mayes,  and  the  Germain 
Street  Quartette.  Mrs.  Harrison  in  her  selections  "The 
Daughter  of  the  Regiment "  and  "Lo,  Here  the  gentle  Lark," 
won  round  after  round  of  applause,  to  which  she  responded 
with  "Jock  o'  Hazeldean."     Mr.  Mayes'  splendid  rendition  of 


2IO  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

the  **  Death  of  Nelson "  evoked  the  mihtary  ardor  of  the 
audience,  which  rose  to  enthusiasm  over  his  encore  "The  Boys 
of  the  old  Brigade."  Bandsmen  Stokes,  Farmer,  Watson, 
and  McKay,  contributed  instrumental  numbers  which  were 
much  appreciated.  Many  of  the  selections  were  arranged  by 
Bandmaster  Horsman,  and,  above  all.  the  marked  success 
of  the  concert  was  due  to  the  untiring  energy  of  Captain  Craw- 
ford, president  of  the  band  committee. 

Loyalists'  Day  was  celebrated  by  i8  guns  from  No.  i,  Captain 
Crawford's  company,  while  on  the  Queen's  Birthday,  No.  2, 
Captain  Baxter  fired  the  usual  salute.  The  guns  of  No.  i  were 
again  heard  on  14th  June,  being  the  occasion  of  the  wedding  of 
Lieutenant  W.  W.  White.  A  similar  service  had  been  rendered 
by  No.  3  a  few  years  before  at  the  marriage  of  Captain  McLeod. 

The  next  in  the  series  of  celebrations  was  a  smoking  concert 
for  the  men,  held- in  Berryman's  Hall,  on  21st  June.  About 
two  hundred  members  of  the  battalion  with  their  friends  were 
present  and  an  enjoyable  time  was  spent.  Captain  Geo.  W.  Jones 
presided  and  a  short  programme  was  carried  out.  The  band 
contributed  several  instrumental  pieces ;  Gunner  Tonge  of  No. 
4  gave  a  comic  song;  Captain  Baxter  read  a  humorous  selection; 
an  exhibition  of  sleight  of  hand  work  was  given  by  Mr.  J.  S. 
MacLaren  ;  a  song  was  sung  by  C.  T.  Gillespie,  and  Major 
Gordon  danced  a  Highland  fling  in  full  native  costume.  Be- 
sides this  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong  read  an  historical 
sketch  of  the  corps ;  Sergeant  Kilpatrick  of  No.  3  gave  a  song ; 
th2  Le\m.\n  Bros,  two  bright  little  chaps  sang  their  amusing 
songs  and  Captain  Hartt,  late  of  the  Rifle  company,-  contributed 
a  couple  of  vocal  selections.  Light  refreshments  were  served 
during   the   evening.     Officers    of   the    8th    cavalry    and    62  nd 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  211 

Fusiliers  were  present  in  uniform,  and  the  smoking  concert 
was  voted  a  very  enjoyable  affair. 

On  the  27th  July  the  corps  together  with  the  Rifle  company 
had  a  march  out  in  the  evening,  and  on  the  following  Sun- 
day both  bodies  paraded  for  divine  service  and  marched  to 
St.  John's  church,  where  the  sermon  was  preached  by  the 
Rev.  John  de  Soyres.  Major  Markham  of  the  8th  cavalry 
was  on  the  staff  and  the  Rifle  company  was  under  command 
of  Captain  E.  A.  Smith.  Inspection  followed  on  3rd  August, 
that  of  No.  2  company  for  gun  drill  being  held  at  the  Carle- 
ton  armory  on  the  succeeding  evening.  The  result  of  the 
inspection  was  gratifying.  Out  of  a  total  strength  of  232,  there 
were  215  of  all  ranks  present  and  the  absentees  accounted  for. 
No.  i,^  Captain  Crawford,  took  the  second  prize  for  general 
efficiency  with  243  points,  while  No.  4,  Captain  Jones,  was  not 
far  behind  with  235.  Nos.  3  and  4  companies  tied  for  the 
Botsford  cup,  which  went  under  the  rules  to  No.  4.  The 
centennial  photograph  of  the  officers  of  the  corps  was  taken  on 
the  4th  August. 

About  this  time  H.  M.  S.  Blake  arrived  in  port  and  a  ball 
was  tendered  by  the  corps  to  the  officers  of  the  ship.  Owing 
to  her  short  stay  in  port  the  invitation  had  to  be  declined. 

On  the  4th  December  Lieutenant-Governor  Boyd,  of  New 
Bruunswick,  died.  At  the  state  funeral  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Armstrong  was  in  charge  of  the  procession,  assisted  by  Chief 
of  Police  Clark  of  St.  John,  and  officers  of  militia  formed  an 
escort  to  the  body.  On  the  i8th  of  the  same  month  Captain 
Robert  Reed,  whose  name  appears  in  the  earlier  portion  of 
this  history,  passed  away,  thus  breaking  one  of  the  few  re- 
maining links  between  the  old  organization  and  the  present. 

The    last    event    in    the    celebration    of    the    centennial,    a 


212  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

grand  ball  given  on  the  zgih.  December  at  the  Assembly  Rooms 
of  the  Mechanics'  Institute,  was  an  unqualified  success.  The 
rooms  were  elaborately  decorated  for  the  occasion.  As  the 
guests  entered  they  were  confronted  by  a  large  field  gun,  be- 
hind which  was  a  collection  of  fire  arms  showing  the  ad- 
vances made  by  modern  science.  In  the  ball  room  the  mas- 
sive pillars  were  trimmed  with  spruce  and  ornamented  with 
bayonets.  At  the  eastern  end  of  the  room,  on  a  background 
enclosed  by  the  colors  of  the  regiment,  were  the  letters  "  N. 
B.  B.  G.  A."  in  blue,  and  under  them  "1793-1893"  in  red. 
Opposite  this  was  a  portrait  of  the  Queen,  on  either  side  of 
which  were  small  flags.  There  were  around  the  walls,  at  regu- 
lar intervals,  stars  of  bayonets,  surmounted  by  flags  and  alter- 
nated with  pictures,  among  which  were  photographs  of  present 
and  past  officers  of  the  corps.  In  an  alcove  stood  two  6-pr. 
guns  with  their  side  arms  complete.  The  supper  room  was 
handsomely  fitted  up,  the  table  being  decorated  with  natural 
flowers.  Upon  it  were  displayed  the  Botsford  cup  and  the 
general  efficiency  prize  won  by  No.  i  company.  A  large  num- 
ber of  guests  were  entertained,  and  it  is  safe  to  say  that  the 
artillery  centennial  ball  will  not  soon  be  forgotten. 

As  light  is  succeeded  by  darkness,  so  in  human  affairs  joy 
gives  place  to  sadness,  and  the  pleasure  of  the  centennial  year 
was  soon  to  be  shadowed  by  the  thought  that  one  more  of 
the  best  loved  officers  of  the  corps  would  never  again  take  part 
in  its  festivities  or  join  in  its  councils.  Sad,  indeed,  was  the 
news  of  the  death  of  Captain  and  Paymaster  George  F.  Smith, 
who  passed  away  on  the  6th  March  following.  A  well-known 
shipowner,  respected  for  his  high  sense  of  honor  and  absolute 
integrity  as  well  as  beloved  for  his  kindliness  and  charm  of 
manner,  his  death  was  regretted    by    the    citizens  at  large,    to- 


N.    n.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  213 

ward  whom  he  had  discharged  many  public  duties.  To  the 
corps  it  was  a  deeper  blow.  Captain  Smith  had  been  active 
'in  his  assistance  to  the  commanding  officer  in  the  time  when 
help  was  needed  upon  his  assuming  the  command,  and  during 
the  succeeding  nine  years  his  best  services  were  always  at  the 
disposal  of  the  corps  in  which  he  took  the  warmest  interest. 
He  had  been  identified  with  the  old  Peters'  battery,  and,  in- 
deed, with  almost  every  athletic  movement  in  the  city.  A 
vestry  man  of  St.  John's  church,  an  ex-president  of  the  Union 
Club  and  a  prominent  supporter  of  the  Neptune  Rowing  Club 
and  the  Athletic  Association,  he  was  above  all  best  known  as 
a  gentleman  in  every  sense  of  the  word.  The  corps  signified 
their  feeling  of  the  loss  which  they  had  sustained  in  the  follow- 
ing resolutions  : 

Resolved,  that  the  officers  of  the  New  Brunswick  Battalion  Gar- 
rison Artillery  hereby  express  their  sense  of  the  great  loss  that 
they  have  sustained  through  the  death  of  their  brother  officer. 
Captain  and  Paymaster,  G.  F  Smith.  For  many  years  he  served 
in  the  ranks  as  a  gunner,  then  as  a  non-commissioned  officer,  and 
for  the  past  nine  years  on  the  staff.  During  all  this  period  he 
showed  his  unswerving  interest  in  the  welfare  of  the  corps,  and  his 
example  and  advice  were  at  all  times  prized  in  the  highest 
degree  by  all  its  members.  His  abilities,  his  urbanity,  his  decision 
of  character,  his  courageousness  of  opinion,  his  mature  judg- 
ment, as  well  as  his  physique,  in  every  way  made  him  the  model 
of  a  good  officer  and  soldier ;  and  further 

Resolved,  that  the  officers  attend  the  funeral  in  a  body  as  a 
mark  of  respect;  and  further 

Resolved,  that  a  copy  of  these  resolutions  be  sent  to  Mrs. 
Smith,  with  the  respectful  condolence  of  the  corps. 

At  the  funeral  the  Artillery  band  assisted,  and  several  of  the 
officers  formed  an  escort,  the  remainder  together  with  officers 
of  other  corps  joining  in  the  procession. 

On  the  29th  July  of  this  year  the   artillery    were    called    on 


214  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

by  ex-Mayor  Peters  to  perform  an  unusual  service  for  militia 
corps,  that  of  presenting  to  a  church  the  colors  of  a  regiment 
that  they  might  be  laid  at  rest.  Mr.  Peters  was  in  possession 
of  the  colors  of  the  ist  Battalion  St.  John  Light  Infantry,  and 
desired  to  have  them  placed  in  St.  Paul's  church.  The  event 
cannot  be  better  described  than  by  the  following  extract  from 
the  *  Daily  Sun '  newspaper  of  the  next  day  : — 

"At  sharp  half-past  two  yesterday  when  the  battalion  assem- 
bled in  the  drill  shed  there  was  the  best  of  weather — ^a  little 
hot  and  dusty,  perhaps,  but  tempered  now  and  again  with  a 
cool  breeze.  The  battalion  fell  in  with  Lieutenant-Colonel 
Armstrong  in  command,  and  Major  Jones  appeared  for  the 
first  time  in  his  new  rank.  In  the  absence,  through  illness, 
of  Captain  Crawford,  Captain  White  took  charge  of  No.  i 
company  with  Lieutenant  B.  R.  Armstrong  as  subaltern.  No.  2 
company  (Carleton)  was  under  command  of  Captain  Baxter, 
with  Lieutenants  Tilley  and  Scovil  ;  No.  3,  under  Captain 
Gordon,  with  Lieutenant  Foster  ;  and  No.  4,  under  Captain 
Armstrong,  with  Lieutenants  Jones  and  Skinner.  On  the 
staff  were  Quartermaster  Gordon,  Surgeon  Andrews  and  a 
number  of  the  retired  officers  of  the  City  Light  Infantry  whose 
colors  were  to  be  presented,  and  also  retired  officers  of  the 
artillery.  Among  them  were  :  A.  A.  Stockton,  M.  P.  P.,  Cap- 
tain Charles  Campbell,  Lieutenant  W.  Roxborough,  Captain 
J.  Alfred  Ring,  Lieutenant  McKinney  and  Captain  A.  W. 
LovETT.  Major  Markham,  of  the  8th  Cavalry,  and  Major  A. 
J.  Armstrong,  of  the  district  staff,  and  Majors  Sturdee, 
Hartt  and  Magee,  with  Surgeon  Walker,  Rev.  Fr.  Daven- 
port, chaplain,  and  Lieutenant  Macmichael,  of  the  62nd,  also 
attended  on  the  staff. 

On  the  Barrack  square  the  battalion  was  drawn  up  in  line 
in  two  ranks,  and  at  3  o'clock  the  color  party,  from  No.  3 
company,  appeared  with  the  colors  guarded  by  fixed  bayonets. 
They  were  received  with  a  general  salute  and  the  colors  taken 
over  by  Lieutenants  Tilley  and  Foster,  the  senior  subalterns  on 
parade.  The  band  played  Auld  Lang  Syne  and  the  National 
Anthem. 

The  battalion  then  marched  in  fours  from  the  left  of  companies. 


N     B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  215 

No.  2  company,  with  fixed  bayonets  and  arms  sloped,  being  the 
escort.  At  King  street  near  Charlotte,  Lieutenant-Colonel 
•Irwin,  inspector  of  artillery,  was  received  with  a  salute  as  he 
joined  the  staff.  At  the  church,  line  was  formed  facing  the 
edifice  and  the  colors  again  saluted,  after  which  column  of 
half  companies  was  formed  to  the  left,  and  the  column  retiring 
formed  quarter  column  on  No.  i,  which  was  in  rear.  They 
then  marched  past  in  column  of  half  companies  by  the  right, 
and  afterwards  in  quarter  column  by  the  left,  with  changed 
ranks.  Line  was  again  formed  facing  the  church,  and  after  a 
general  salute  the  companies  entered  and  took  their  places  in 
the  church,  the  officers  occupying  seats  in  the  east  side  of  the 
south  transept. 

No.  3  company,  with  bayonets  fixed,  then  entered  the  church 
and  was  stationed  in  the  centre  aisle  with  shouldered  arms. 
The  color  party  passed  through  the  main  entrance,  and  was 
received  with  presented  arms,  after  which  the  company  formed 
up,  facing  the  chancel.  Thomas  VV.  Peters  then  stepped  forward 
and,  addressing  the  rector,  said  that  the  ceremony  took  place  at 
the  request  of  old  officers  of  the  battalion,  and  that  he  pre- 
sented the  flags  for  that  purpose,  they  having  come  into 
his  possession  through  his  father,  who,  as  colonel,  had  the 
custody  of  them.  The  battalion  was  the  first  of  the  city  militia 
corps  under  the  old  system,  and  had  been  in  existence  for 
many  years,  but  the  loss  of  the  old  files  of  new^spapers  from 
1838  to  1843  rendered  it  impossible  to  fix  the  date  of  the 
presentation  with  precision.  Among  its  officers  had  been  Sir 
Leonard  Tilley,  the  ex-Governor  of  the  Province,  and  VV.  O. 
Smith,  once  Mayor  of  the  city.  The  colors  had  never  seen 
active  service,  but  he  had  no  doubt  that  those  who  bore  them 
then  would  have  stood  by  them  manfully  had  they  been  called 
on  to  do  so,  and  he  was  equally  sure  that  those  who  laid 
them  to  rest  in  the  sacred  edifice  were  imbued  with  the  loyal 
spirit  and  determination  of  their  forefathers. 

Mr.  Peters  then  took  the  colors  from  Lieutenants  Tilley  and 
Foster  and  handed  them  to  Rev.  Mr.  Dicker,  the  rector,  who 
in  turn  passed  them  to  Canon  DeVeber,  by  whom  they  were 
placed  in  the  chancel. 

Rev.  Mr.  Dicker  then  read  a  formal  acceptance  of  the 
colors  for  the  purpose  of  repose,  after    which  a  short    evening 


2l6  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

service  was  conducted  and  Rev.  Archdeacon  Brigstocke  deliv- 
ered an  address. 

The  escort  again  saluted  the  colors,  while  the  National  Anthem 
was  played,  after  which  and  the  recessional  the  troops  left  the 
church  and  formed  again  on  the  street.  They  marched  back 
to  the  drill  shed,  where  after  an  expression  of  thanks  from 
Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong,  to  the  retired  and  visiting 
officers  who  had  so  kindly  assisted  in  the  ceremony  and  a  few 
words  of  encouragement  to  the  officers  and  men  under  his 
command  for  the  way  in  which  their  work  had  been  performed, 
the  battalion  dispersed. 

This  year's  inspection  held  on  the  30th  July  and  succeeding 
days  was  a  rigid  test  of  the  corps  and  resulted  in  No.  4  company 
Captain  T.  E.  G.  Armstrong  winning  the  second  general  effi- 
ciency prize  with  231  points.  This  company  also  took  the 
Botsford  cup.  The  illness  of  Capt.  Crawford  of  No.  i,  and 
a  severe  family  affliction  which  he  had  sustained,  called  forth 
the  sympathy  of  every  officer  and  man  in  the  battalion. 

Major  Jones  donated  a  handsome  silver  cup  for  competition 
among  the  companies,  and  desired  that  it  should  be  awarded 
upon  the  general  efficiency  points  exclusive  of  those  for  officers 
questions.     It  was  won  for  the  first   time    by  No.   i  company. 

His  Excellency  the  Earl  of  Aberdeen,  Governor-General 
of  Canada,  and  the  Countess  of  Aberdeen,  visited  St.  John 
for  the  first  time  on  13th  August.  Owing  to  the  late  hour  of 
their  arrival  there  was  no  demonstration  until  the  next  morn- 
ing, when  at  the  opening  of  the  reception  in  the  Common 
Council  chamber  No.  3  company,  under  Captain  Gordon, 
fired  a  salute  of  nineteen  guns  from  King  street  east,  the  62nd 
Fusiliers  furnishing  a  guard  of  honor.  Upon  their  departure 
for  Fredericton  the  next  day  a  salute  was  fired  from  Fort 
Howe  by  a  detachment  from  No.  4  company.  On  Thursday 
evening,    14th    August,    a    levee    was    held    in  the  Mechanics' 


N.    v..    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  217 

Institute    at    which    the    officers  of  the  artillery,  among  others, 
were  present. 

Gunner  Frederick  M.  Burgess,  of  No.  3  company,  who 
was  accidentally  drowned  on  13th  August  was  buried 
with  military  honors  by  his  company.  The  loss  of  the  yacht 
'Primrose'  in  a  sudden  squall  during  a  race  in  St.  John  har- 
bor on  2 1  St  August  also  deprived  No.  4  company  of  a  mem- 
ber, Corporal  T.  H.  Bartlett.  His  last  military  service  was 
the  firing  of  the  salute  on  the  departure  of  the  Governor- 
General.  The  company  presented  his  widow  with  a  resolution 
of  sympathy  suitably  engrossed  and  a  substantial  testimonial. 

Judge  B.  Lester  Peters,  the  captain  of  the  old  'Kid  Glove' 
battery,  was  also  on  25th  November  numbered  among  those 
departed.  At  his  funeral  which  took  place  on  28th  November,  the 
Lieutenant-Colonel  and  officers  of  the  corps  attended.  Outside 
of  the  pall-bearers  walked  thirty  members  of  the  old  battery. 
They  were  George  E.  Thomas,  James  F.  Robertson,  Joseph 
Allison,  W.  A.  Lockhart,  W.  E.  Vroom,  John  H.  Parks,  F. 
W.  Wisdom,  John'  C.  Miles,  S.  K.  Wilson,  J.  Fred  Lawton, 
C.  Fred  Langan,  Chas.  Campbell,  Arthur  W.  Lovett,  Joseph 
B.  Stubbs,  R.  H.  Arnold,  John  McLauchlan,  D.  D.  Robertson, 
Frank  O.  Allison,  Frank  Gallagher,  P.  R.  Inches,  M.  D.,  J.

J.  S.  Kaye,  C.  U.  Hanford,  Charles  McLauchlan,  E.  G.  Scovil, 
George  B.  Hegan,  Albert  S.  Hay  and  Frank    Lansdowne. 

At  the  regimental  meeting  on  23rd  March  of  the  following 
year.  Major  Jones  formally  presented  to  the  corps  the  cup 
which  is  known  by  his  name,  and  received  a  hearty  vote  of 
thanks  for  his  handsome  gift. 

Loyalists'  Day  was  ag^in  celebrated  by  a  salute  from  Fort 
Dufiferin  by  No.  2  company,   and    later   in  the  year,  upon  the 


2l8  HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 

return  of  Major  Markham  of  the  8th  Princess  Louise  Hus- 
sars, the  commandant  of  the  Bisley  team  of  1895,  to  his  home 
in    Saint  John,  he  was  serenaded  by  the  Artillery  band. 

On  August  loth  No.  2  company  attended  divine  service  at 
St.  George's  church,  Carleton,  where  an  excellent  sermon  was 
preached  by  the  rector,  Rev.  W.  H.  Sampson. 

The  Artillery,  62nd  Fusiliers  and  Rifle  company  were  bri- 
gaded, under  Lieutenant-Colonel  Armstrong,  for  service  at 
Trinity  church  on  the  29th  of  the  same  month,  and  an  appro- 
priate address  was  delivered  by  Rev.  Father  Davenport, 
chaplain  of  the  62nd  battalion. 

Inspection  was  held  on  22nd  October  and  following  days  by 
Lieutenant-Colonel  Montizambert,  and  resulted  in  'the  winning 
by  No.  I  company.  Captain  Crawford,  of  the  second  general 
efficiency  prize  with  246  points,  only  two  points  behind  the 
highest  score  made.  This  company  also  won  the  Jones  and 
Botsford  cups.  No.  2  company  stood  second  in  the  battalion 
and  fifth  in  the  Dominion  with  237  points. 

After  the  inspection  the  inspecting  officer  was  entertained  at 
supper  at  the  Union  Club  and  a  very  enjoyable  evening  was  spent. 

On  the  1 6th  December,  Langford  McFrederick,  a  gunner 
in  No.  2  company  was  accidentally  killed  while  at  work.  His 
funeral  which  took  place  on  the  19th  December,  was  attended 
by  the  company  in  uniform  and  the  usual  honors  were  paid. 
The  death  on  17th  January,  1896,  of  Paymaster  Sergeant  Fred 
L.  Hea,  removed  an  active  and  useful  non-commissioned 
officer  from  the  staff.  The  officers  of  the  corps  attended  the 
interment. 

In  the  preceding  November  a  change  occurred  in  the  adju- 
tancy, Captain  White  being  transferred  from  No.  5  company 
to  that  position.      Since  the  roll   of  the    centennial  year  there

have  been  but  two  changes  in  the  staff  non-commissioned  offi- 
cers. Sergeant  Thomas  H.  Johnston  of  No.  2  became 
Orderly  Room  Clerk  in  October,  1895,  and  upon  the  death  of 
Staff-sergeant  Hea  was  transferred  to  the  appointment  of  Pay- 
master-sergeant. Sergeant  John  C.  Edwards  of  No.  3  was 
then  appointed  Orderly  Room  Clerk.  The  only  staff  sergeant 
who  has  not  as  yet  received  special  mention  is  Quartermaster 
Sergeant  James  Brown,  whose  attachment  to  the  force  has 
caused  him  to  serve  in  it  for  upwards  of  thirty-seven  years. 

On  January  30th,  1896,  No.  4  company,  by  invitation  of 
Captain  T.  E.  G,  Armstrong,  had  a  sleigh  drive  and  supper, 
an  event  of  which  the  guests  will  long  have  a  pleasant  recol- 
lection. 

In  the  early  part  of  this  year  Lieutenant  Temple  succeeded 
to  the  command  of  No.  5  company;  Second  Lieutenant  B. 
R.  Armstrong  w^as  promoted  to  the  first  lieutenancy  in  No.  i, 
and  Ernest  Ray  Jones  was  appointed  second  lieutenant  in 
No.  5. 

At  the  close  of  the  previous  year  the  designation  of  the 
corps  was  again  changed,  the  new  title  being  *'  New  Brunswick 
Regiment,  Canadian  Artillery."  Practically  a  reversion  to  the 
title  by  which  the  corps  was  first  known,  the  change  was  a 
welcome  one  to  the  regiment.  Equal  pleasure  was  not  afforded, 
however,  by  the  numbering  of  the  corps  as  "  3rd,"  while  the 
beginning  of  its  regimental  history  is  at  least  eighteen  years 
earher  than  that  of  the  Montreal  regiment,  which  is  second, 
and  over  thirty  years  earlier  than  that  of  Halifax,  which  is 
styled  the  first.  It  is  hoped  that  in  time  due  recognition  will  be 
given  to  the  continuity  of  the  history  of  our  corps  and  that 
the  right  of  the  regiment  to  the  first  place  on  the  list  will  be 
acknowledged.      It  is  submitted  that  the  pages  of  this    history 


HISTORICAL    RECORDS    OF    THE 


contain  ample  and  incontrovertible  evidence  in  support  ot   the 
claim. 


The  story  of  our  corps  is  now  brought  to  a  close.  It  can 
not  be  said  to  be  replete  with  incidents  of  sensational  nature, 
yet  neither  is  it  a  record  of  which  the  citizens  who  are  its 
members  need  be  ashamed.  The  feeHng  grows  that  war  as  a 
means  of  settling  international  questions  must  in  time  give  way 
to  a  more  enlightened  and  more  highly  developed  system. 
Arbitration  replaces  carnage  and  the  student  succeeds  the  soldier. 
Yet  war  has  not  been  without  its  use  nor  battle  without 
humanity.  The  soldier  and  the  best  soldier  has  thought  for 
his  age  as  deeply  as  the  statesman,  and  by  his  success  has 
taught  that  science,  not  numbers,  is  truly  power.  Nor,  when 
war  has  become  a  matter  of  history  will  its  influence  for  good 
have  passed  away.  The  spirit  of  fairness  and  honor  which  has 
characterized  the  soldier  in  all  ages  will  survive  to  ennoble 
more  peaceful  arts  and  will  have  its  weight  in  the  settlement 
of  the  future  problems  of  the  world.  To  an  unthinking 
portion  of  the  public,  no  doubt,  the  maintenance  of  a  militia 
seems  well  nigh  useless,  but  to  those  who  appreciate  the 
ffiorak  of  such  a  force  its  utility  is  apparent.  The  lad  who 
dons  a  uniform  feeling  that  it  is  the  outward  and  visible  em- 
blem of  identification  with  his  country,  becomes  a  better 
citizen  because  of  his  aspiration.  In  the  ranks  he  acquires 
that  spirit  of  comradeship,  and  devotion  to  an  ideal,  which,  in 
its  application  through  all  the  departments  of  the  life  of  the 
nation  conduces  to  a  grander  fulfilment  of  the  destinies  of  the 
race.  '  Shoulder  to  shoulder '  he  realizes,  is  the  secret  of  suc- 
cess.     True   discipline,    he   finds,  is   after  all  not  an    arrogant 


N.    B.    GARRISON    ARTILLERY.  221 

exercise  of  authority  but  a  wise  direction  of  his  individuality  so 
,  that  it  may  best  combine  with  that  of  others  towards  the  at- 
tainment of  a  desired  object.  With  proficiency  in  his  work 
grows  the  abiHty  to  apply  in  the  larger  sphere  of  the  exercise 
of  his  rights  and  duties  as  a  citizen,  the  lessons  which  he  learns 
as  a  soldier.  The  importance  of  good  direction,  the  sacredness 
of  honor  and  the  glory  of  devotion  to  principle  become  factors 
in  his  daily  life  and  he  also  feels  that  in  the  organization  of 
w^hich  he  has  become  a  member,  there  are  no  limits  to  his 
ambition,  but  those  of  ability  and  fidelity.  Such  is  the  teach- 
ing of  a  military  force,  and  such,  as  well  as  the  important  duty 
of  being  thoroughly  trained  and  available  for  the  defence  of 
his  country,  are  reasons  why  the  youth  of  our  land  should 
enrol  themselves  in  its  ranks  with  the  encouragement,  appro- 
bation and  active  assistance  of  every  true  citizen  and  patriot. 
Nor  should  the  social  side  be  overlooked.  In  the  ranks,  there 
is  that  feeling  of  unity — of  comradeship — which  lives  in  grate- 
ful memory  through  the  after  life  of  the  volunteer  as  well  as 
of  the  soldier.  With  a  sadness  that  is  not  all  sorrow  it  causes 
the  old  man  to  say : — 

"Where  are  the  boys  of  the  Old  Brigade, 
Where  are  the  lads  we  knew?" 

who  in  his  youth  resonantly  sang : 

"  Steadily,  shoulder  to  shoulder, 
Steadily,  side  by  side. 
Ready  and  strong 
We  are  marching  along. 
Like  the  boys  of  the  Old  Brigade  ! ''
