There are only 10
                                                countries in Conmebol, which has been dominated by Brazil and Argentina. Brazil will host the 2014 World Cup, the first time the tournament has been played in South America since 1978 in Argentina. Concacaf
                                                has been dominated by Mexico and the U.S.</p>

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">If one color has been missing from recent iterations of the jersey worn by United States national team players &#x2014; men and women &#x2014; it is most certainly red.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That oversight was remedied by Nike when it unveiled on Monday the new home shirts (shorts and socks, too) that will soon be worn by the national teams. In the &#x201C;Hoops Edition,&#x201D; the jerseys, above
                                                and at right, feature a body with red and white stripes. The color blue is reduced from dominant to complementary as the trim around the neck collar. And in continuing homage to what still remains as the
                                                seminal game in the history of the men&#x2019;s national team &#x2014; the 1950 World Cup win against England in Brazil &#x2014; the jerseys have what Nike calls &#x201C;a tonal sash to echo the same design&#x201D;
                                                from the jerseys worn all those years ago.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The women&#x2019;s jersey is slightly more tailored than the men&#x2019;s number while both versions will include the United States flag, the Stars and Stripes, inside the back of the neck. To complete the new
                                                home look, the players will wear blue shorts with white socks that have a blue band around the top (and addition cushioning on the sole).</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The men&#x2019;s jersey will be available at retail beginning April 26; the women&#x2019;s on July 1. The men will first wear the new shirts in their friendly international against Scotland in Jacksonville,
                                                Fla., on May 26; the women in their friendly international against China in Chester, Pa., on May 27.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">According to Nike, each of the new uniforms is made with an average of 13 recycled plastic bottles. The shorts are 100 percent <a title="Info" href="https://www.ehow.com/about_6465448_nike-dri_fit_.html">Dri-FIT</a>                                                recycled polyester and the jersey has a minimum 96 percent Dri-FIT polyester.

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And well it should be. France&#x2019;s national team has talent to spare, and world-class players such as Franck Rib&#xE9;ry, Florent Malouda and Hugo Lloris should be available for the game. Moreover, Coach
                                                Laurent Blanc has adopted a slow-and-steady approach to transforming the squad that embarrassed itself at the 2010 World Cup, and his tactics are already paying dividends. Despite Blanc&#x2019;s commitment
                                                to using younger players and focusing his efforts on preparations for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Les Bleus recently clinched a spot in the 2012 European championships and are generally on the upswing.</p>

The team has a long history of poor performances in Europe, having lost its last six matches on the continent. More troublesome, the squad has yet to coalesce
                                                under Coach Jurgen Klinsmann, suffering through a 1-3-1 record and scoring only two goals in five games. And when one factors in the absence of <a href="https://www.ussoccer.com/News/Mens-National-Team/2011/11/LD-Roster.aspx">Landon Donovan, who has pulled out of the friendly</a>                                                so he can focus on the M.L.S.

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">With six goals in nine La Liga matches so far this season,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0LjuMEjUqw"> Karim Benzema</a> is one of the biggest stars on a Real Madrid squad filled with them. A technical
                                                wizard with a nose for the net, Benzema poses an extraordinary threat for a U.S. backline that sometimes seems in disarray. While the U.S. captain Carlos Bocanegra has the experience and wherewithal to stand
                                                up to a striker like Benzema, it is hard to imagine the lead-footed Oguchi Onyewu or the timid Michael Orozco Fiscal faring well in a one-on-one exchange with the 23-year-old Lyon native. If either &#x2013;
                                                or both &#x2013; get into the game, expect Benzema to call for the ball as often as possible.</p>

                                                who is just doing a fantastic job for this team,&#x201D; Klinsmann told reporters after the U.S. lost, 1-0, to Ecuador on Oct. 11. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s somebody who cleans up, he&#x2019;s everywhere, he&#x2019;s
                                                aggressive and he wins so many balls back. We don&#x2019;t want to have him out of the team.&#x201D; While some might argue that Beckerman is a step (or two) too slow for the international game, he will
                                                certainly have a chance to prove doubters wrong against France and Rib&#xE9;ry. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8bDkPFc_6E">The Bayern Munich attacker is on a ridiculous run of form</a>, and can
                                                make the best No. 6&#x2019;s in the world look silly. If Beckerman can neutralize Rib&#xE9;ry and hold down the real estate in front of the central defense, Klinsmann will certainly lavish the dreadlocked
                                                midfielder with even more praise.</p>

                                                But <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/player-ratings-u-s-0-ecuador-1/">Cherundolo, 32, struggled badly against Ecuador</a> last month, and given his age, there have been
                                                some rumblings that the Hannover captain might be approaching his expiration date. If that is indeed the case, expect Chelsea left wing Florent Malouda to have a big game on Friday. Although just one year
                                                younger than Cherundolo, the left-footed Malouda is both physically imposing and technically skilled &#x2013; a lethal combination. It should be fun to see these two veterans square off.</p>

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Make no mistake about it: Brek Shea does not care if he lines up against Anthony R&#xE9;veill&#xE8;re, Mathieu Debuchy, Cafu or the 101st Airborne Division. The 21-year-old from College Station, Tex., has a
                                                wonderfully na&#xEF;ve fearlessness that has served him well in M.L.S. and might do the same for him <a href="https://aol.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2011-11-03/dallas-star-brek-shea-to-train-with-arsenal">in the English Premier League</a>.
                                                Now that Shea seems to have a lock on the left wing position for the U.S., his<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/u-s-national-team-data-dive-ratings-stats-and-opinions/"> next challenge is to maintain the consistency</a>                                                he has shown thus far. Can R&#xE9;veill&#xE8;re, a veteran with Lyon, or Debuchy, a midfielder/right back hybrid who plays for Lille, clamp down on Shea&#x2019;s marauding ways? Absolutely. But do not bet
                                                on it.</p>

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The last time Jozy Altidore, 22, suited up for the United States in a friendly competition in Europe, he found himself isolated against Vincent Kompany, Belgium&#x2019;s rugged, 6-foot-3 central defender.
                                                <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/player-ratings-belgium-1-vs-u-s-0/">The evening did not go well for Altidore</a>. Altidore could be in for more of the same on Friday,
                                                as he will have to contend with Adil Rami &#x2013; France&#x2019;s uncompromising central defender, who is also 6-3. When Altidore can outmuscle an opponent, he often thrives. When he feels physically dominated,
                                                he sometimes retreats into a shell. It will be interesting to see if Altidore can muster the will to compete for 90 minutes, and if Klinsmann can provide the striker with the tactical support necessary to
                                                threaten French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.</p>

I&#x2019;m happy there. My daughter is in school and we&#x2019;re all very comfortable. There was interest but nothing
                                                materialized so I have this season and another one at Fulham, and I look forward to having another good season. I&#x2019;ve always dreamed of playing Champions League soccer but whether that&#x2019;s in

He showed some good moments against Mexico and Costa Rica and
                                                showed why he belongs on the field. I look forward to playing alongside him.&#x201D;</p>

                                                It will be nice when we have our complete team together as we head into World Cup qualifiers.&#x201D;</p>

I think a lot of teams wanted him &#x2014; Tottenham, Newcastle, and probably a lot of other teams we&#x2019;re interested in his<br> services. He has a good left foot, he can come inside,
                                                he can play up top. He&#x2019;s a player who can score goals with his head. He brings more<br> technical quality to our side. &#x201C;</p>
