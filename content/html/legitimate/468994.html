CONVENTION  HALL, 
FIFTH  MARYLAND  REGIMENT  ARMORY, 

BALTIMORE,  MD.,  June  25,  1912. 

"THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  (Mr.  Norman  E.  Mack,  of  New  York, 
Chairman  of  the  Democratic  National  Committee,  at  12  o'clock 
meridian).  The  Convention  will  come  to  order.  The  call  of  the  Na- 
tional Committee  for  the  Convention  will  be  read. 

The  official  call  for  the  Democratic  National  Convention  was  read  as 
follows : 

WASHINGTON,  D.  C.,  January  9,  1912. 

To  THE  DEMOCRATS  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES: 

By  the  authority  of  the  Democratic  National  Executive  Committee  a 
National  Convention  of  the  Democratic  party  is  hefeby  called  to  meet  in 
the  City  of  Baltimore,  Maryland,  on  Tuesday,  the  25th  of  June,  1912,  at 
twelve  o'clock  noon,  to  nominate  candidates  for  the  Presidency  and 
Vice-Presidency  of  the  United  States,  to  declare  a  party  platform,  and 
to  take  such  other  action  as  may  be  deemed  advisable. 

Delegates  and  alternates  from  each  State  of  the  Union  shall  be  chosen 
to  the  number  of  two  delegates  for  every  Senator  and  two  delegates  for 
every  Representative  from  the  States  respectively  in  the  Congress  of  the 
United  States,  under  the  Congressional  reapportionment  of  districts  based 
upon  the  census  of  1910.  In  addition,  the  Territory  of  Alaska  and  the 
District  of  Columbia  are 'entitled  to  six  delegates  and  six  alternates  each, 
and  six  delegates  and  six  alternates  likewise  allotted  each  to  the  Philip- 
pines, Hawaii  and  Porto  Rico. 

In  the  choice  of  delegates  and  alternates  to  represent  the  States  and 
the  Territories  at  the  said  National  Convention  the  Democratic  State  or 
Territorial  committees  may,  if  not  otherwise  directed  by  the  law  of  such 
States  or  Territories,  provide  for  the  direct  election  of  such  delegates 
or  alternates  if  in  the  opinion  of  the  respective  committees  it  is  deemed 
desirable  and  possible  to  do  so  with  proper  safeguards.  Where  such  pro- 
vision is  not  made  by  the  respective  committees  for  the  choice  of  dele- 
gates and  alternates,  and  where  the  State  laws  do  not  provide  specifically 
the  manner  of  such  choice,  then  the  delegates  and  alternates  to  the  said

National  Convention  shall  be  chosen  in  the  manner  that  governed  the 
choice  of  delegates  from  the  respective  States  and  Territories  to  the  last 
Democratic  National  Convention. 

NORMAN  E.  MACK,  Ch'airm'an. 

UREY  WOODSON,  Secretary. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Prayer  will  be  offered  by  His  Eminence, 
Cardinal  Gibbons. 

• 

PRAYER    OF    HIS    EMINENCE    JAMES    CARDINAL    GIBBONS. 
ARCHBISHOP   OF  BALTIMORE. 

His  Eminence  James  Cardinal  Gibbons,  Archbishop  of  Baltimore, 
offered  the  following  prayer: 

We  pray  Thee  O  God  of  might,  wisdom  and  justice,  through  Whom 
authority  is  rightly  administered,  laws  are  enacted  and  judgment  de- 
creed, assist  with  Thy  Holy  Spirit  of  counsel  and  fortitude,  the  President 
of  these  United  States,  that  his  administration  may  be  conducted  in 
righteousness,  and  be  eminently  useful  to  Thy  people  over  whom  he  pre- 
sides, by  encouraging  due  respect  for  virtue  and  religion,  by  a  faith- 
ful execution  of  the  laws  in  justice  and  mercy  and  by  restraining  vice 
and  immorality. 

Let  the  light  of  Thy  divine  Wisdom  direct  the  deliberations  of 
this  Convention  and  shine  forth  in  all  its  proceedings  and  enactments',  so 
.  that  they  may  tend  to  the  preservation  of  peace  and  g&lt;5od  will  and  the 
promotion  of  concord  and  harmony. 

May  authority  be  exercised  in  this  Convention  without  despotism, 
and  liberty  prevail  without  license.  May  this  Convention  demonstrate 
once  more  to  the  American  people  and  to  the  world  at  large  that  the  citi 
zens  of  the  United  States  have  solved  the  problem  of  self-government  by 
exercising  and  tolerating  the  broadest  apd  most  untrammeled  freedom  of 
discussion  in  their  political  assemblies,  without  dethroning  reason  and 
without  invading  the  sacred  and  inviolable  rights  of  law  and  of  public- 
order. 

May  the  delegates  assembled  to  select  a  candidate  for  Chief  Magis 
trate  be  ever  mindful  that  they  are  the  sons  of  the  same  heavenly 
Father,  that  they  are  brothers  of  the  same  national  family,  that  they  are 
fellow  citizens  of  the  same  glorious  Republic,  that  they  are  the  joint 
heirs  of  the  same  heritage  of  freedom,  and  may  it  be  their  highest  ambi- 
tion to  transmit  this  precious  inheritance,  unimpaired,  to  their  chiMren 
and  their  children's  children.  May  the  consciousness  of  this  community 
of  interests  banish  from  their  hearts  all  bitterness,  hatred  and  ill  will, 
and  inspire  them  with  sentiments  of  genuine  charity,  benevolence  and 
mutual  respect  and  forbearance. 

We  recommend  likewise  to  Thy  unbounded  mercy  all  our  brethren 
and  fellow  citizens  throughout  the  United  States,  that  they  may  be 
blessed  in  the  knowledge  and  sanctified  in  the  observance  of  Thy  mosr 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  3 

holy  law;  that  they  may  be  preserved  in  union  and  in  that  peace  which 
the  world  cannot  give,  and  after  enjoying  the  blessings  of  this  life,  they 
may  be  admitted  to  those  which  are  eternal. 

Our  Father,  who  art  in  heaven,  hallowed  be  Thy  name.  Thy  king- 
dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth  as  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread,  and  forgive  us  our  trespasses  as  we  forgive  those 
who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation,  but  deliver 
us  from  evil.  Amen. 

SELECTION  OF  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  I  am  instructed  by  the  National  Committee 
to  submit  the  name  of  Hon.  Alton  B.  Parker,  of  New  York,  for  Tempo- 
rary Chairman  of  the  Convention.  Other  nominations  are  in  order. 

MR.  WILLIAM  JENNINGS  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman  and 
gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  rise  to  place  in  nomination  for  the  office 
of  temporary  chairman  of  this  convention  the  name  of  Hon.  John  W. 
Kern,  of  Indiana.  [Applause.]  And  in  thus  dissenting  from  the  judg- 
ment of  our  National  Committee  as  expressed  in  its  recommendation,  I 
recognize  that  the  burden  of  proof  is  upon  me  to  overthrow  the  assump- 
tion that  the  committee  can  claim  that  it  is  representing  the  wishes 
of  this  Convention  and  of  the  party  in  the  nation.  [Applause.]  I  call 
your  attention  to  the  fact  that  our  rules  provide  that  the  recommendation 
of  the  committee  is  not  final.  I  remind  you  that  the  very  fact  that  this 
Convention  has  the  right  to  accept  or  reject  that  recommendation  is  con- 
clusive proof  that  the  presumption  in  favor  of  this  convention  is  a  higher 
presumption  than  that  in  favor  of  the  wisdom  of  the  committee. 
[Applause.] 

If  any  of  you  ask  me  for  my  credentials,  if  any  of  you  inquire 
why  I,  a  mere  delegate  to  this  Convention  from  one  of  the  smaller  States, 
should  presume  to  present  a  name  and  ask  you  to  accept  it  in  place  of1 
the  name  they  presented,  I  beg  to  tell  you,  if  it  needs  to  be  told,  that 
in  three  campaigns  I  have  been  the  champion  of  the  Democratic  party's 
principles,  and  that  in  three  campaigns  I  have  received  the  vote  of  six 
millions  and  a  half  of  Democrats.  [Applause.]  If  that  is  not  proof  that 
I  have  the  confidence  of  the  party  of  this  nation,  I  shall  not  attempt  to 
furnish  proof.  I  remind  you  that  confidence  reposed  in  a  human  being 
-  with  it  certain  responsibilities,  and  I  would'not  be  worthy  of  the- 
confidence  and  the  affection  that  have  been  showered  upon  me  by  the 
Democrats  of  this  nation  if  I  were  not  willing  to  risk  humiliation  in  their 
defense. 

I  recognize  that  a  man  can  not  carry  on  a  political  warfare  in  de- 
fense of  the  mass  of  the  people  for  sixteen  years  without  making  enemies. 
and  I  recognize  that  there  has  been  no  day  since  the  day  I  was  nomi- 
nated in  Chicago  when  these  enemies  have  not  been  industrious  in  their 
efforts  to  attack  me  from  every  standpoint.  The  fact  that  I  have  lived 


4  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE  . 

is  proof  that  I  have  not  deserted  the  people.     If  for  a  moment   I   had 
forgotten  them,  they  would  not  have  remembered  me. 

I  tako  for  my  text  this  morning  the  text  that  the  committee  has  been 
kind  enough  to  place  upon  the  wall  for  my  use.  He  "never  soJd  the 
truth  to  serve  the  hour. ' '  That  is  the  language  of  the  hero  of  Monti- 
cello,  and  I  would  not  be  worthy  of  the  support  I  have  received  if  I  were 
willing  to  sell  the  truth  to  serve  the  present  hour. 

We  are  told  by  those  who  support  the  Committee's  recommendation 
that  it  is  disturbing  harmony  to  oppose  their  conclusions.  Let  me  free 
myself  from  any  criticism  that  any  one  may  have  made  heretofore  or 
may  attempt  hereafter.  Is  there  any  other  delegate  in  this  body  of  more 
than  ten  hundred  who  tried  earlier  than  I  to  secure  harmony  in  this 
Convention?  I  began  several  weeks  ago.  I  announced  to  the  sub-coin 
mittee  that  I  would  not  be  a  candidate  for  Temporary  Chairman.  I 
might  have  asked  without  presumption  that  at  the  end  of  sixteen  years 
of  battle,  when  I  find  the  things  I  have  fought  for  not  only  triumphant 
in  my  own  party  but  even  in  the  Republican  party,  the'modest  honor  of 
standing  before  this  Convention  and  voicing  the  rejoicing  of  my  party. 
[Applause.]  But  I  was  more  interested  in  harmony  than  I  was  in  the 
chance  to  speak  to  this  Convention.  Not  only  that,  but  I  advised  this 
Committee  to  consult  the  two  leading  candidates,  the  men  who  to- 
gether have  nearly  two-thirds  of  this  Convention  instructed  for  them,  and 
get  their  approval  of  some  man 's  nomination,  that  there  might  be  no 
contest  in  this  Convention.  [Applause.]  My  friends,  what  suggestion 
could  I  have  then  made  more  in  the  interest  of  harmony  than  to  ask  this 
Committee  to  allow  two-thirds  of  this  Convention  a  voice  in  the  selection 
of  its  temporary  chairman? 

In  the  discussion  before  the  sub-committee  the  friends  of  Mr.  Clark 
and  the  friends  of  Mr.  Wilson  were  not  able  to  a.gree;  one  supported 
,  Mr.  James  and  the  other  supported  Mr.  Henry ;  but  in  the  full  committee 
last  night  the  friends  of  Mr.  Wilson  joined  the  friends  of  Mr.  Clark  in 
the  support  of  Mr.  James,  Mr.  Clark's  choice,  and  yet  the  Committee 
turned  down  the  joint  request  thus  made. 

I  submit  to  you  that  the  plan  that  I  followed  was  the  plan  for  the 
securing  of  harmony;  and  that  the  plan  which  the  Committee  followed 
was  not  designed  to  secure  harmony.  [Applause.] 

Let  me  for  a  moment  present  the  qualifications  of  one  fitted  for  this 
position.  This  is  no  ordinary  occasion.  This  is  an  epoch-making  (  '(in- 
vention. We  have  had  such  a  struggle  as  was  never  seen  in  politics 
before.  I  have  been  in  the  center  of  this  fight,  and  I  know  something 
of  the  courage  that  it  has  brought  forth,  and  something  of  the  sacrifice 
.that  has  been  required.  I  know  that  men  working  upon  the  railroad  for 
small  wages,  with  but  little  laid  up  for  their  retiring  years,  have  defied 
the  railroad  managers  and  helped  us  in  this  progressive  fight  at  the  risk 
of  having  their  bread  and  butter  taken  from  them.  I  have  known  men 
engaged  in  business  and  carrying  loans  at  banks  who  have  been  threat- 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  5 

ened  with  bankruptcy  if  they  did  not  sell  their  citizenship,  and  yet  I  have 
seen  them,  defying  these  men,  walk  up  and  vote  on  the  side  of  the 
struggling  masses  against  predatory  wealth.  [Applause.]  I  have  seeu 
lawyers  risking  their  future,  alienating  men  of  large  business,  in  order 
to  be  the  champions  of  the  poor.  I  have  seen  this  struggle  go  on.  I 
have  seen  men  who  had  never  made  a  speech  before  go  out  and  devote 
\\reks  of  time  to  public  speaking,  because  their  hearts  were  stirred.  It 
seems  to  me  that  now,  when  the  hour  of  triumph  comes,  the  song  of 
victory  should  be  sung  by  one  whose  heart  has  been  in  the  fight. 

John  W.  Kern  has  been  faithful  every  day  in  those  sixteen  years.  It 
has  cost  him  time,  it  has  cost  him  money,  and  it  has  cost  him  the  wear 
of  his  body  and  his  mind.  He  has  been  free  always  with  all  that  he  had; 
and  four  years  ago,  when  the  foundation  was  laid  for  the  present  vic- 
tory, it  was  John  W.  Kern  who  stood  by  my  side  when  we  took  the  last 
stronghold  of  the  enemy.  It  was  John  W.  Kern  who  stood  with  me  and 
helped  to  bring  into  the  campaign  the  idea  of  publicity  before  the 
election,  that  has  now  swept  the  country,  until  even  the  Kepublican  party 
was  compelled  by  public  opinion  to  give  it  unanimous  endorsement  only 
a  few  weeks  ago.  [Applause.]  It  was  John  W.  Kern  who  stood  with 
me  on  the  Denver  platform  that  demanded  the  election  of  Senators  by 
direct  vote  of  the  people,  when  a  Republican  National  Convention  had 
turned  it  down  by  a  vote  of  seven  to  one;  and  now  he  is  in  the  United 
States  Senate,  where  he  can  make  a  Senator  look  as  big  as  a  Senator 
ought  to  look  to  the  American  people.  [Applause.]  He  helped  in  the 
fight  for  the  Amendment  authorizing  an  income  tax,  and  he  has  lived  to 
see  a  President  who  was  opposed  to  us  take  that  plank  out  of  our  plat- 
form and  put  it  through  Senate  and  House,  and  thirty-four  States  of 
the  Union  have  ratified  it;  and  now  he  is  leading  the  fight  in  the  United 
States  Senate  to  purge  that  body  of  Senator  Lorimer,  who  typifies  the 
supremacy  of  corruption  in  politics.  [Applause.]  •" 

What  better  man  could  we  have  to  open  a  convention?  I  repeat,  what 
better  man  could  we  find  to  represent  the  militant  spirit  of  democracy? 
[Applause.]  My  friends,  when  I  come  to  contrast  him  with  the  candi- 
date presented  by  the  Committee,  I  can  do  it  without  impeaching  his 
character  or  his  good  intent. 

But,  my  friends,  not  every  man  of  high  character  or  good  intent  is 
a  fit  man  to  sound  the  keynote  of  a  progressive  campaign.  There  are 
seven  million  Republicans  in  this  country,  or  were  at  the  time  of  the 
last  election,  and  I  have  never  doubted  that  the  vast  majority  of  them 
were  men  of  high  character  and  good  intent,  but  we  would  not  invite  one 
of  them  to  be  Temporary  Chairman  of  our  Convention.  We  have  a 
great  many  Democrats  who  vote  the  ticket  who  are  not  in  full  sympathy 
with  the  purposes  of  the  party.  I  not  only  voted  the  ticket,  but  I  made 
speeches  for  the  candidate  when  I  was  not  at  all  satisfied  with  either 
the  candidate  or  the  influences  that  nominated  him  and  directed  the 
campaign  of  1904.  [Applause.]  And  I  assume  that  no  friend  of  Judge 


6  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Parker  will  contend  that  he  was  entirely  satisfied  in  1908  with  either  the 
candidate  or  all  of  the  plans  and  purposes  of  our  party. 

I  remind  you  that  this  is  not  a  question  where  personal  ambitions 
or  personal  compliments  or  the  pleasant  things  are  uppermost.  We  a#e 
writing  history  today,  and  this  Convention  is  to  announce  to  the  country 
whether  it  will  take  up  the  challenge  thrown  down  at  Chicago  by  a  Con- 
vention controlled  by  predatory  wealth,  or  answer  it  by  putting  ourselves 
under  the  same  control  and  giving  the  people  no  party  to  represent 
them.  [Applause.] 

We  need  not  deceive  ourselves  that  that  which  is  done  in  a  National 
Convention  is  done  in  secret.  If  every  member  of  this  Convention 
entered  into  an  agreement  of  secrecy  we  would  still  act  under  the  eyes  of 
the  representatives  of  the  press,  who  know  not  only  what  we  do,  but 
why  we  do  it,  and  who  told  us  to  do  it.  [Applause.]  And  the  delegates 
of  this  Convention  must  not  presume  upon  the  ignorance  of  those  people 
who  did  not  come,  either  because  they  had  not  influence  enough  to  be 
elected  delegates  or  money  enough  to  pay  the  expenses  of  the  trip, 
but  who  have  as  much  interest  in  the  party 's  welfare  as  we  who  speak 
for  them  today.  [Applause.]  Those  people  will  know  that  the  influences 
which  dominated  the  Convention  at  Chicago  and  made  its  conclusions  a 
farce  before  the  country  are  here  and  are  more  brazenly  at  work  than 
they  were  at  Chicago.  [Applause.] 

""*  I  appeal  to  you:  Let  the  commencement  of  this  Convention  be  such  a 
commencement  that  the  Democrats  of  this  country  may  raise  their  heads 
among  their  fellows  and  say,  ' '  The  Democratic  party  is  true  to  the 
people.  You  can  not  frighten  it  with  your  Ryans  nor  buy  it  with  your 
Belmonts. "  [Applause.] 

My  friends,  if  the  candidate  selected  by  the  Committee  were  an 
unknown  man  we  would  judge  him  by  the  forces  that  are  back  of  him, 
and  not  by  you  gentlemen  who  may  try  to  convince  yourselves  that  you 
owe  it  to  the  Committee  to  sustain  its  action  even  though  you  believe 
it  a  mistake. 

That,  my  friends,  is  not  the  question.  We  know  who  the  candidate  is 
as  well  as  the  men  behind  him.  We  know  that  he  is  the  man  chosen 
eight  years  ago  when  the  Democratic  party,  beaten  in  two  campaigns, 
decided  it  was  worth  while  to  try  to  win  a  campaign  under  the  leader- 
ship of  those  who  had  defeated  us  in  the  campaigns  before.  The  country 
has  not  forgotten  that  that  Convention  was  influenced  to  its  act  by  the 
promise  of  large  campaign  funds  from  Wall  Street,  and  it  has  not 
forgotten  the  fact  that  after  the  corporation  management  of  that  cam- 
paign had  alienated  the  rank  and  file  of  the  party,  Wall  Street  threw  the 
party  down  and  elected  the  other  man.  [Applause.]  It  has  not  for- 
gotten that  when  the  votes  were  counted  we  had  a  million  aijd  a  quarter 
less  votes  than  we  had  in  the  two  campaigns  before,  and  a  million  and  a 
quarter  less  than  we  had  in  the  election  four  years  afterward.  It  has 
ot  forgotten  that  it  is  the  same  man  backed  by  the  same  influence  that 


« 


PKMOUnATIC    NATIONAL   CONTENTION  7 

is  to  be  forced  on  this  Convention  to  open  a  progressive  campaign  with 
a  paralyzing  speech  that  will  dishearten  every  man  in  it.  [Applause.] 

You  ask  me  how  I  know  without  reading  it  that  that  speech  would 
not  be  satisfactory.  Let  me  tell  you;  a  speech  is  not  so  many  words; 
it  is  the  man  and  not  the  words  that  makes  the  speech. 

We  have  been  passing  through  a  great  educational  age,  and  the  demo- 
n-it ir  movement  has  been  sweeping  all  obstacles  before  it  around  the 
world.  In  Kussia  emancipated  serfs  have  secured  the  right  to  a  voice  in 
their  government.  In  Persia  the  people  have  secured  a  constitution.  In 
Turkey  the  man  who  every  hour  was  in  danger  of  being  cast  into  prison 
without  an  indictment,  or  beheaded  without  a  charge  against  him,  now 
has  some  influence  in  the  molding  of  the  laws.  And  China,  the  sleeping 
giant  of  the  Orient,  has  risen  from  a  slumber  of  two  thousand  years 
and  today  is  a  republic  waiting  for  recognition.  And  while  the  outside 
world  has  been  marching  at  double  quick  in  the  direction  of  more  com- 
plete freedom,  cur  nation  has  kept  step,  and  on  no  other  part  of  God 's 
footstool  has  popular  government  grown  more  rapidly  than  here.  In 
every  State  the  fight  has  been  waged. 

The  man  whom  I  present  has  been  the  leader  of  the  progressive  cause 
in  his  State,  and  once  joint  leader  in  the  nation. 

I  challenge  you  to  find  in  sixteen  years  an  occasion  where  the  candi- 
date presented  by  the  Committee  has,  before  an  election,  gone  out  and 
rendered  any  effective  service  in  behalf  of  any  man  who  was  fighting 
the  people's  cause  against  plutocracy. 

Now  this  is  the  situation  which  we  have  to  meet.  The  Democratic 
party  has  led  this  fight  until  its  action  has  stimulated  a  host  of  Eepub- 
licans  to  imitation.  I  will  not  say  these  Republicans  have  acted  as  they 
have  because  we  acted  first;  I  would  rather  say  that  they  at  a  later 
hour  than  we  hare  caught  the  spirit  of  the  time  and  are  now  willing  to 
trust  the  people  with  the  control  of  their  own  government.  [Applause.] 

We  have  been  traveling  in  the  wilderness.  We  have  now  come  in 
sight  of  the  promised  land.  During  all  the  weary  hours  of  darkness 
progressive  democracy  has  been  the  people's  pillar  of  fire  by  night.  I 
pray  you,  delegates,  now  the  dawn  has  come,  do  not  rob  our  party  of 
the  right  so  well  earned  to  be  the  people's  pillar  of  cloud  by  day. 
[Applause.] 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  present  as 
the  next  speaker  Senator  John  W.  Kern,  of  Indiana.  [Applause.] 

MR.  JOHN  W.  KERN,  of  Indiana:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the! 
&lt; 'omention,  I  desire  a  hearing  in  order  that  I  may  state  my  reason  for 
not  desiring  to  enter  the  contest  for  Temporary  Chairman  of  this  Con- 
vention. I  believe  that  by  forty  years  of  service  to  my  party  I  have 
earned  the  right  to  such  a  hearing  at  the  hands  of  a  Democratic  Con- 
vention. [Applause.]  I  hail  from  the  State  of  Indiana,  which  will 
shortly  present  to  this  Convention  for  its  consideration  the  name  of  one 
of  the  best,  truest,  and  most  gallant  Democrats  on  this  earth,  in  the 


8  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

person  of  the  Honorable  Thomas  E.  Marshall,  the  Governor  of  that  State. 
I    [Applause.] 

^*"  I  desire  to  take  no  part  in  this  Convention  that  will  in  any  wise 
militate  against  him  or  against  his  interests,  which  all  true  Indiana 
Democrats  this  day  loyally  support.  I  have  been  for  many  years  a 
personal  friend  of  the  gentleman  who  has  been  named  by  the  National 
Committee.  Many  years  ago  when  Judge  Parker  and  I  were  much 
younger  than  we  are  now,  we  met  in  a  hotel  in  Europe  and  became  warm 
personal  friends.  That  was  long  before  his  elevation  to  the  Chief 
Justiceship  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  of  his  State.  Since  that  time  I 
have  enjoyed  his  friendship.  He  has  had  mine.  I  have  accepted  the 
hospitality  of  his  home,  and  in  1904  when  he  was  a  candidate  for  the 
Presidential  nomination,  moved  largely  by  that  personal  friendship  f 
enlisted  under  his  standard  for  the  nomination  long  before  the  Conven- 
tion and  went  through  that  great  battle  in  St.  Louis  in  his  behalf.  In 
that  campaign,  in  response  to  a  request  of  Judge  Parker  personally  made 
to  me,  I,  on  account  of  my  friendship  for  him,  took  the  standard  of  a 
losing  cause  as  candidate  for  Governor  of  Indiana,  and  carried  it  on  to 
defeat,  but  I  hope  not  an  inglorious  defeat.  In  1908  Judge  Parker 
canvassed  in  my  State  for  the  National  ticket,  on  which  I  was  a  candi- 
date for  Vice-President.  Last  year,  when  I  was  a  candidate  for  the 
Senate,  in  the  midst  of  a  heated  contest,  Judge  Parker  traveled  from 
New  York  to  Indianapolis  to  make  a  speech  in  my  behalf. 

We  have  been  during  all  these  years,  and  are  now,  personal  friends. 
The  greatest  desire  of  my  heart  is  the  hope  of  a  Democratic  victory. 
I  attended  a  National  Convention  in  Baltimore  in  1872,  before  I  had 
east  a  vote,  and  my  young  heart  was  filled  with  no  more  enthusiasm 
for  success  that  year  than  my  old  heart  is  now.  [Applause.]  I  believe 
Judge  Parker  is  as  earnestly  in  favor,  as  earnestly  desirous  of  Demo- 
cratic success  this  year,  as  I  am. 

There  are  only  a  little  over  a  thousand  delegates  in  this  Convention ; 
there  are  seven  million  Democrats  between  the  oceans.  There  are  mil- 
lions of  Democrats  scattered  from  one  end  of  this  Republic  to  the  other 
who  this  hour  are  all  looking  with  aching  hearts  upon  the  signs  of 
discord  that  prevail  here  when  there  ought  to  be  forerunners  of  victory 
in  the  shouts  of  this  Convention.  Is  there  a  man  here  who  does  not 
earnestly  desire  harmony  to  the  end  that  there  may  be  victory? 

I  am  going  to  appeal  now  and  here  for  that  kind  of  harmony  which 
alone  will  bring  victory.  I  am  going  to  appeal  here  and  now  for  that 
kind  of  harmony  which  will  change  the  sadness  that  this  hour  exists  in 
millions  of  Democratic  homes  into  shouts  of  joy  and  gladness.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

My  friend  Judge  Parker  sits  before  me  in  this  Convention,  he  repre- 
senting the  National  Committee,  I  representing,  not  another  faction, 
thank  God,  but  representing  perhaps  another  section,  and  we  two  men 
have  it  in  our  power  to  send  these  words  of  gladness  flashing  throughout 


DEMOCRATIC  XATIONAL  CONVENTION  9 

the  Republic.  [Applause.]  If  my  friend  will  join  with  me  now  and  here  in 
the  selection  of  a  man  satisfactory  to  us  both,  if  he  will  stand  in  this 
presence  with  me  and  agree  that  that  distinguished  New  Yorker  who 
has  brought  more  honor  to  the  Empire  State  in  the  United  States  Senate 
than  it  has  had  since  the  days  of  Francis  Kernan — James  A.  O  'Gorman — 
this  discord  will  cease  in  a  moment  and  the  great  Democratic  party  will 
present  a  united  front.  Or  if  he  will  agree  that  Jhat  splendid  represen- 
tative from  the  State  of  Texas  in  that  same  body,  Charles  A.  Culberson, 
shall  preside,  or  if  he  will  agree  upon  that  splendid  parliamentarian, 
Henry  D.  Clayton  of  Alabama,  or  if  he  will  agree  upon  that  young 
Tennesseean,  whose  name  is  known  in  every  home  where  chivalry  abides — 
Luke  Lea — this  matter  fan  be  settled  in  a  moment.  Or  if  he  will  agree 
on  the  blue-eyed  statesman  from  Ohio,  Governor  James  E.  Campbell;  or 
if  he  will  agree  on  the  reform  governor  of  Missouri,  ex-Governor  Folk; 
or  if  -he  will  agree  on  my  own  colleague,  the  stalwart  Democrat  from 
Indiana,  Hon.  Benjamin  F.  Shively,  all  this  discord  will  cease. 

Will  someone  for  Judge  Parker,  will  Judge  Parker  himself,  meet  me 
on  this  ground  and  aid  in  the  solution  of  this  problem,  a  solution  of 
which  means  victory  to  the  party  and  relief  to  the  tax-payers  of  the 
country  I 

My  fellow-Democrats,  you  will  not  promote  harmony,  you  will  not 
point  the  way  to  victory  by  jeering  or  deriding  the  name  of  the  man  who 
led  your  fortunes  in  1908.  You  may  put  him  to  the  wheel,  you  may 
humiliate  him  here,  but  in  so  doing  you  will  bring  pain  to  the  hearts  of 
six  million  men  in  America  who  would  gladly  die  for  him.  [Applause.  | 
You  may  kill  him,  but  you  do  not  commit  homicide  when  you  kill  him ; 
you  commit  suicide. 

My  friends,  I  have  submitted  a  proposition  to  Judge  Parker;  I  sub- 
mit it  to  the  man,  the  leader  of  the  New  York  Democracy,  who  holds  that 
Democracy  in  the  hollow  of  his  hand.  What  response  have  I?  [A  pause.] 
If  there  is  to  be  no  response,  then  let  the  responsibility  rest  where  it 
belongs.  If  Alton  B.  Parker  will  come  here  now  and  join  me  in  this 
request  for  harmony,  his  will  be  the  most  honored  of  all  the  names 
amongst  American  Democrats.  [Applause.] 

If  there  is  to  be  no  response,  if  the  responsibility  is  to  rest  there,  if 
this  is  to  be  a  contest  between  the  people  and  the  powers,  if  it  is  to  be  a 
contest  such  as  has  been  described,  a  contest  which  I  pray  God  may  be 
averted,  then  the  cause  to  which  I  belong  is  so  great  a  cause  that  I  an1 
not  fit  to  be  its  leader.  If  my  proposition  for  harmony  is  to  be  ignored, 
.•aid  this  deplorable  battle  is  to  go  on,  there  is  only  one  man  fit  to  lead 
the  hosts  of  progress,  and  that  is  the  man  who  has  been  at  the  forefront 
for  sixteen  years,  the  great  American  tribune,  William  Jennings  Bryan. 
|  Applause.]  If  you  will  have  nothing  else,  if  that  must  be  the  issue, 
then  the  leader  must  be  worthy  of  the  cause,  and  that  leader  must  be 
William  Jennings  Bryan.  [Applause.]  — 


10  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Gentlemen,  Mr.  Bryan  desires  to  make  a 
brief  statement. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen,  I  tried  to 
get  the  committee  to  agree  upon  a  progressive,  and  when  it  did  not  agree 
upon  a  progressive,  I  went  to  the  man  who  received  the  largest  number 
of  votes,  Congressman  James,  and  urged  him  to  be  our  leader  in  this 
fight,  but  he  felt  that  the  conditions  were  such  that  he  could  not  honor- 
ably accept  the  invitation.  I  went  to  Senator  O 'Gorman  and  urged  him 
to  accept  this  leadership,  and  then  I  appealed  to  Mr.  Kern  to  accept  it, 
and  I  stand  ready  to  support  any  progressive  who  will  lead  this  battle. 
[Applause.] 

But  if  no  other  progressive  appears  I  shall  accept  the  leadership  an.l 
let  you  express  through  your  votes  for  or  against  me  your  advocacy  of 
or  opposition  to  what  we  have  fought  for  for  sixteen  years.  [Applause.] 
~  MR.  THEODORE  A.  BELL,  of  California:  Mr.  Chairman — 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman  from 
California. 

MR.  THEODORE  A.  BELL,  of  California:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
of  the  Convention,  when  the  Democrats  of  this  country  assembled  in 
the  city  of  Denver  four  years  ago  they  accorded  to  me  an  honor  that 
had  not  been  paid  to  the  Pacific  Coast  or  its  representatives  in  many 
years,  by  permitting  me  the  privilege  of  presiding  over  that  National 
Convention  as  its  Temporary  Chairman;  and  I  am  here  today  to  say  at 
the  very  outset  that  I  stand  in  Baltimore  for  the  same  kind  of  Democracy 
that  I  stood  for  at  Denver  four  years  ago.  [Applause.] 

I  am  not  unmindful  of  the  fact  that  I  would  never  have  been  selected 
as  the  Temporary  Chairman  of  that  Convention  unless  my  Democracy 
had  received  the  stamp  of  approval  from  the  distinguished  gentleman 
from  the  State  of  Nebraska;  and  at  the  conclusion  of  that  Convention  it 
was  my  distinguished  honor  to  go  to  the  city  of  Indianapolis  and  there 
to  notify  the  present  illustrious  Senator  from  that  State  that  at  the 
hands  of  the  Democracy  of  America  he  had  received  its  nomination  for 
the  second  place  upon  that  ticket.  For  these  reasons  it  is  to  me  a 
matter  of  keen  personal  regret  today  that  on  this  question  I  cannot  find 
myself  in  accord  with  either  of  my  two  friends  and  allies  of  four 
years  ago. 

That  far-off  western  State  of  California  has  sent  me  with  twenty  fixe 
other  gentlemen  to  represent,  with  whatever  power  and  judgment  and 
conscience  a  divine  providence  has  bestowed  upon  us,  the  sentiment  and 
the  will  of  the  Democracy  of  that  State,  and  when  this  roll  is  called  upon 
the  question  as  to  which  of  these  two  gentlemen  shall  preside  over  our 
preliminary  organization,  I,  as  a  representative  of  the  great  State  of 
California,  much  as  I  shall  regret  to  take  that  stand,  shall  cast  my 
vote  in  favor  of  Alton  B'.  Parker,  of  New  York.  [Applause.]  And  when 
that  vote  is  cast  for  the  distinguished  gentleman  from  New  York,  it 
will  be  cast  by  Bell  and  hundreds  of  other  loyal  supporters  of  the  gentle- 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  11 

man  from  Nebraska  during  the  last  sixteen  years,  not  in  the  belief, 
or,  thank  God,  even  in  the  suspicion  that  Parker  represents  any  sinister 
influences  at  work  in  American  politics,  but  that  vote  will  be  cast  in 
the  honest  belief  that  Judge  Parker's  Democracy  has  stood  the  severest 
test  to  which  any  man's  Democracy  could  have  been  subjected,  and  that 
test  is  that  it  passed  the  inspection  and  received  the  approval  of  Mr. 
Bryan  in  1908.  [Appplause.]  Four  years  ago,  in  the  thriving  and  pro- 
gressive city  of  Portland,  it  was  my  great  pleasure  to  listen  to  one  of 
the  first  addresses  that  was  made  in  behalf  of  Mr.  Bryan  upon  the 
Pacific  Coast,  and  it  fell  from  the  lips  of  Judge  Parker  in  the  city  of 
Portland. 

And,  gentlemen  of  this  Convention,  during  that  campaign  of  four 
years  ago  the  friends  of  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  followed  the  dis- 
tinguished gentleman  from  New  York,  as  he  traveled  through  ten  of  our 
western  States,  upholding  the  standard  bearer  and  the  standard  of 
Democracy. 

I  havo  this  question  now  to  submit  to  the  members  of  this  Convention : 
I  want  to  know  what  change  has  come  over  the  Democracy  of  Parker 
during  a  period  of  four  years.  [Applause.]  What  changes  have  come 
in  the  character  of  that  democracy,  that  made  this  man's  democracy  so 
welcome  in  1908  and  make  it  so  obnoxious  in  19121 

My  friends,  we  are  in  harmony  with  nearly  all  the  views  which  have 
been  expressed  here  by  the  distinguished  gentlemen  who  have  addressed 
this  Convention.  They  have  correctly  stated  to  you  that  the  democracy 
of  America  expects  this  Convention  to  adopt  a  progressive  platform, 
and  to  name  upon  that  platform  a  man  absolutely  in  harmony  with  every 
syllable  f-nd  paragraph  of  that  progressive  platform.  We  stand  now  in 
this  Convention,  exercising  the  God-given  right  of  independent  thought 
and  independent  conscience,  to  say  that  upon  a  matter  of  this  kind  the 
men  who  have  followed  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  in  the  past  may 
with  the  same  honesty  of  judgment  which  he  is  exercising  for  himself, 
vote  for  the  man  for  Temporary  Chairman  of  this  Convention  that  we 
think  must  nearly  represents  the  sentiment  of  this  Convention. 

Now,  gentlemen  of  this  Convention,  I  am  going  to  conclude  with  this 
prophecy,  that  when  Judge  Parker  has  delivered  his  message  to  the 
people  of  this  country  of  ours,  and  they  are  given  the  chance  in  No- 
\enilier  next  to  ratify  or  disapprove  the  action  of  this  Convention,  they 
will  at  the  polls  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Pacific  ratify  the  selection 
today  of  Alton  B.  Parker,  of  New  York,  for  Temporary  Chairman. 
|  Applause.] 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  Chair  recognizes  Representative  John 
J.  Fitzgerald,  of  New  York. 

MR.  ELMORE  W.  HURST,  of  Illinois:  I  move  that  the  nominations  be 
now  closed,  and  that  we  proceed  to  a  vote. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Congressman  Fitzgerald,  of  New  York,  has 
the  floor. 


12  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

— ^ 

ME.  JOHN  J.  FITZGERALD,  of  New  York:  Gentlemen  of  this  Conven- 
tion, I  ask  for  but  five  minutes  in  which  to  speak  to  this  Convention. 

New  York  has  presented  a  distinguished  Democrat  to  preside  over 
this  Convention.  He  helped  to  write  the  Denver  platform  upon  whiVi! 
Mr.  Bryan  made  his  last  campaign.  He  earnestly  supported  Mr.  Bryan 
throughout  the  country.  "When  this  Temporary  Chairmanship  was  &lt;lis 
cussed,  it  was  offered  to  Mr.  Bryan,  and  New  York  would  have  supported 
him  loyally  had  he  desired  the  place. 

Judge  Parker  is  an  advocate  of  the  income  tax,  of  the  direct  election 
of  United  States  Senators  by  the  people,  of  a  low  tariff,  of  the  publicity 
of  campaign  contributions.  He  did  not  seek  this  distinction.  As  an  hon- 
orable man  he  will  not  withdraw  from  this  contest.  He  is  a  sufficiently 
loyal  Democrat  to  be  willing  to  submit  his  claims  to  this  Convention  for 
action,  and  whatever  this  Convention  may  determine,  he  will  loyally 
abide  by  the  result.  [Applause.] 

ME.  ELMORE  W.  HUEST,  of  Illinois:  Mr.  Chairman — 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  ElmoK? 
W.  Hurst)  will  now  be  recognized. 

MR.  ELMORE  W.  HURST,  of  Illinois:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  nomi- 
nations be  now  closed,  and  that  we  proceed  to  vote. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the  motion 
of  the  gentleman  from  Hlinois  that  nominations  be  closed,  and  that  the 
Convention  proceed  to  vote.  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll. 

MR.  LUKE  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  Mr.  Chairman,  there  are  gentleman 
here  who  desire  to  be  heard,  and  they  will  be  heard.  We  are  not  going 
to  have  gag  rule  here,  as  there  was  at  Chicago. 

MR.  BRYAX,  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a  point  of  order. 
Our  Conventions  'are  conducted  according  to  rules.  The  Chairman  an- 
nounced that  the  roll  would  be  called  while  delegates  were  on  their  feet 
seeking  recognition  and  ready  to  speak.  My  point  of  order  is  that  as  no 
limitation  has  been  placed  upon  either  the  number  of  nominating 
speeches,  or  upon  the  length  of  a  speech,  the  Chairman  has  no  right  on 
his  own  motion  to  close  the  debate,  and  that  it  must  proceed  until  it  is 
closed  in  accordance  with  the  rules. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  Chair  desires  to  make  a  statement.  The 
motion  that  the  Chair  put  was  offered  by  Mr.  Hurst,  of  Illinois,  whom 
the  CJiair  recognized.  The  Chair  simply  put  his  motion.  It  was  not 
suggested  by  the  Chair. 

MR.  LUKE  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  cu-li  sido 
be  allowed  15  minutes  more  to  conclude  the  debate.  ["No,  no.  "|  Then 
I  suggest  5  minutes. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman  frore 
Texas  (Mr.  Cone  Johnson)  for  five  minutes. 

MB.  CONE  JOHNSON,  of  Texas:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  the  forty 
votes  from  Texas  on  the  floor  of  this  Convention  represent  twenty  Demo 
crats  in  the  Congress  of  th«  United  States,  and  twenty  electoral  votes  for 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  13 

Hie  nominee  of  this  Convention.  All  that  Texas  risks  is  that  she  be  given 
that  respectful  heaving  to  which  her  matchless  Democratic  record  entitles 
her  at  the  hands  of  every  Democrat  here.  [Applause.] 

The  progress  of  human  government,  like  the  course  ,of  nature,  does 
not  move  in  a  steady  stream,  but  in  waves.  The  blood  in  the  veins  does 
not  circulate  in  a  constant  flow,  but  by  heart-beats.  The  tides  yonder 
rise  and  fall;  night  follows  day,  and  men  sleep  but  wake  again.  When 
Thomas  Jefferson  was  elected  President  a  new  blow  was  struck  for  the 
freedom  of  speech,  the  freedom  of  religion  and  the  freedom  of  the 
press.  Yonder  picture  of  the  sturdy  form  of  Andrew  Jackson  stands 
for  the  supremacy  of  the  law  and  the  majesty  of  the  Constitution.  The 
gaunt  form  and  pathetic  face  of  Abraham  Lincoln  figured  the  downfall  of 
human  slavery,  ;;nd  the  perpetuation  of  the  American  Union.  The  oppres- 
sion of  tariff  exactions  called  to  leadership  the  rugged  patriot,  Cleveland. 
The  rising  tide  of  trust  creations,  strangling  the  freedom  of  trade,  and 
the  riot  of  ill-gotten  wealth  roused  a  giant  from  Nebraska's  plains,  am! 
Bryan  led  a  revolution  in  thought  as  lasting  as  the  Republic  itself. 
[Applause.] 

The  tide  is  coming  in  again.  It  is  a  Democratic  flood-tide.  Its 
roar  was  heard  in  the  Congressional  elections  of  1910,  which  restored 
to  us  the  House  of  Congress  and  would  have  redeemed  the  American 
Senate.  It  is  the  cry  of  the  people  to  be  restored  to  the  paths  of 
Democratic  equality;  the  cry  of  the  toiling  millions  not  to  be  robbed 
of  the  fruits  of  their  hands ;  the  cry  of  rage  against  the  shameless 
purchase  of  seats  of  power  for  privilege;  the  shout  of  protest  against 
the  miserable  doctrine  that  we  are  to  live  under  an  aristocracy  of  gov- 
erning class.  The  Democracy  must  not  loiter  on  the  shore.  Let  us 
boldly  put  our  barks  to  sea  and  the  Republican  ship  will  go  down  in 
the  gale  of  November,  lost  in  the  weltering  tempest  of  a  nation  's  just 
rebuke.  [Applause.] 

I  care  nothing  about  how  this  fight  originated;  whether,  as  some 
have  said,  it  was  precipitated  by  Mr.  Bryan  interfering  when  he  ought 
to  have  been  silent,  or  whether  it  is  the  action  of  the  National  Com- 
mittee in  presenting  the  name  of  Judge  Parker.  This  one  thing  1  know 
— the  fight  is  on  and  Bryan  is  on  one  side  and  Wall  Street  is  on  the 
other.  [Applause.] 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  time  of  the  gentleman  from  Texas  has 
expired.  . 

Mi:.  JOHNSON:  Just  one  word  in  conclusion.  The  issue  is  drawn.  The 
country  is  looking  at  us  anxiously ;  for  this  Convention  under  any  circum- 
stances to  put  Bryan  to  the  knife  of  defeat  will  send  a  chill  to  the  hearts 
of  a  half  million  Democrats  in  Texas  and  six  and  a  half  million  Demo- 
crats in  the  United  States.  [Applause.] 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  If  there  are  no  further  speeches,  the  Secre- 
tary will  call  the  roll  on  the  question  of  selecting  a  Temporary  Chairman.

MR.  MAI.OXE.  of  Alabama:  This  question  does  not  affect  his  (Under-

20  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Almighty  God,  Whose  kingdom  is  everlasting,  and  power  infinite,  have 
mercy  upon  this  whole  beloved  land  and  country,  wherein  Thou  hast 
given  us  the  privilege  to  dwell. 

We  pray  Thee  that  Thou  wouldst  so  rule  the  hearts  of  our  rulers  and 
all  in  authority  over  us  that  they,  knowing  whose  ministers  they  are, 
may  above  all  things  seek  Thy  honor  and  glory  and  the  true  welfare  of 
our  people;  and  that  Thou  wilt  so  rule  their  minds  that  they  may  have 
wisdom  to  know  what  they  ought  to  do,  and  also  may  havo  grace,  and 
strength,  and  courage  faithfully  to  .fulfill  the  same.  And  for  our  people1 
we  pray  that  their  minds  and  hearts  may  be  set  on  righteousness,  which 
exalteth  a  nation,  and  set  against  sin,  which  is  shame  and  destruction  to 
any  people. 

And  now  we  pray  Thy  special  blessing  upon  the  work  of  this  assem- 
bly gathered  in  Thy  name  and  presence.  Save  them  from  all  error, 
ignorance,  pride,  and  prejudice,  and  of  Thy  great  mercy  direct,  sanctify 
and  govern  them  in  their  work.  Most  gracious  God,  as  for  the  people  of 
these  United  States  in  general,  so  especially  for  their  representatives  in 
this  Convention  assembled,  we  pray  that  Thou  wouldst  direct  and  prosper 
all  their  consultations  to  the  advancement  of  Thy  glory,  the  good  of 
Thy  Church,  the  safety,  honor  and  welfare  of  this  people,  that  all 
things  may  be  so  ordered  and  settled  by  their  endeavors  upon  the  best 
and  surest  foundations,  that  peace  and  happiness,  truth  and  justice, 
religion  and  piety,  may  be  established  among  us  for  all  generations. 

And  all  this  we  ask  in  the  name  and  for  the  sake  of  Thy  blessed 
Son,  Jesus  Christ,  our  Lord,  in  whose  own  won  is  we-  sum  up  all  our 
petitions. 

Our  Father  Who  art  in  heaven,  hallowed  by  Thy  name.  Thy  king- 
dom come.  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth  as  it  is  in  heaven.  Give  us  this 
day  our  daily  bread.  And  forgive  us  our  trespasses  as  we1  forgive  then; 
that  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into  temptation  but  deliver  us 
from  evil.  For  thine  is  the  kin;  &lt;l&lt;.m,  and  the  power,  and  the  glory,  for- 
ever and  ever.  Amen. 

ADDRESS  OF  THE   TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN. 

» 

MR.  ALTON  B.  PARKER,  of  New  York:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention, 
we  meet  while  the  hills  yet  echo  to  wild  cries  of  liar,  thief  and  traitor, 
and  furious  wails  of  fraud,  bribery,  treachery  and  corruption;  and  our 
ears  are  weary  with  the  din  of  the  articulate  shrieking  and  passionate 
vilification  of  the  most  shameful  brawl  of  our  political  history. 

Our  candidates,  however,  are,  without  exception,  men  of  such  lofty 
mien  that  we- meet  immune  from  the  distemper  which  seized  the  Chi- 
cago Convention,  and  privileged  to  discharge  a  solemn  public  duty 
calmly,  deliberately,  seriously. 

The  cause  of  government  by  the  people  the  world  over  has  been 
materially  checked  by  the  disgraceful  wrangle  which  terminated  in  th&lt; 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION        21 

bedlam  of  Chicago.  Every  good  citizen  has  been  put  to  shame  by  the 
brutality  and  the  abuse  which  characterized  this  quarrel  between  a  Presi- 
dent and  an  ex-President.  Gratitude,  friendship,  party  loyalty,  j.a- 
triotism  and  common  decency  were  forgotten  in  the  tussle. 

We  have  had  a"  little  difference  here  today;  a  question  of  men;  but, 
my  fellow  delegates,  there  was  nothing  said,  I  now  think,  by  the  prin- 
cipal debaters  on  either  side  which  was  intended  to  wound.  If,  for  a 
moment,  I  thought  the  chief  speaker  a  bit  harsh,  I  remembered  on  the 
other  hand  those  three  magnificent  struggles  that  he  has  made  in  this 
country  as  the  chosen  standard-bearer  cf  the  Democratic  party.  [A  burst 
of  applause  and  shouts  of  Bryan.] 

I  realize  that  all  this  has  meant  much — very  much  to  him — and  if  he 
is  mistaken  in  regard  to  my  position,  as  we  must  assume,  I  believe  it  to 
be  your  duty  and  mine  to  forget  it  and  to  co-operate  with  him  in  further- 
ing the  highest  party  and  public  interests  in  this  Convention. 

There  is  one  place  in  this  Convention  where  he  is  capable  of  render- 
ing great  party  service — service  unsurpassed  by  any  one.  That  is  the 
Chairmanship  of  the  Eesolutions  Committee.  I  hope  and  believe  that 
every  member  of  the  Eesolutions  Committee  will  honor  himself  by  casting 
his  vote  for  Mr.  Bryan  for  Chairman.  [Applause.] 

My  fellow  Delegates,  there  are  no  reactionaries  in  the  Democratic 
party.  There  may  have  been  once,  but  there  are  none  now.  All  Demo- 
crats are  progressive.  [Applause.]  It  may  be  possibly  true  that  here 
in  this  great  Convention,  composed  of  the  ablest  and  strongest  men  in 
the  party,  and  coming  from  every  section  of  this  vast  country,  with  all 
its  varied  interests,  that  each  .and  every  member  may  not  be  able  to 
agree  at  once  that  within  the  limits  of  a  single  highway  can  be  found 
the  only  road  to  progress;  but  all  can  and  will  agree  upon  this  one 
proposition,  that  the  voice  of  the  majority  of  this  Convention,  speaking 
through  its  Committee  on  Resolutions  and  subsequent  adoption  by  the 
Convention,  shall  speak  the  will  of  every  Democrat  here.  [Great  Ap- 
plause.] 

The  assault  upon  the  unwritten  prohibition  against  a  third  term 
made  in  the  wild  scramble  for  the  Republican  nomination  warns  us  of 
the  vital  necessity  of  incorporating  in  our  Constitution  a  safeguard 
against  repeated  terms. 

In  the  vory  beginning  of  our  constitution  making  it  was  urged  by 
delegates  participating,  that  safety  required  a  constitutional  limitation 
of  the  period  of  years  one  man  might  hold  the  office  of  President.  His- 
tory warned  them  of  Ihe  coming  of'a  man  whose  insatiable  lust  of 
power  would  be  as  consuming  as  Caesar's,  towering  high  above  his  lovo 
of  country.  The  danger  seemed,  even  to  the  pessimists,  to  have  passed 
with  the  establishment  of  a  precedent  by  Washington,  Jefferson,  and 
their  successors.  Indeed,  where  lives  the  man  who  has  not  either  heard 
or  said,  that  an  unwritten  law  forbids  more  than  two  terms,  and  if  any 


22  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

one  could  be  so  foolhardy  as  to  seek  further,  lie  would  be  crushed   by 
the  wrath  of  a  patriotic  and  intelligent  people.     [Applause.] 

The  man  who  split  his  party  at  Chicago,  once  recognized  the  third 
term  tradition,  and  acknowledged  its  application  to  his  situation,  On 
the  eve  of  his  triumph  in  nineteen  hundred  four  he  said:  "The  wise 
custom  which  limits  the  President  to  two  terms  regards  the  substnn.-c- 
and  not  the  form,  and  under  no  circumstances  will  I  be  a  candidate  for 
or  accept  another  nomination." 

Wrong  in  this  year  of  grace,  he  was  right  in  that.  Peradventure 
he  was  honest  with  his  soul  and  he  may  have  confessed  to  it  that  even 
a  President  may  be  tempted  to  resort  to  sordid  devices  and  shameless 
importunities- to  gain  his  ambition.  If  so,  he  was  in  mental  condition 
to  realize  to  the  full  the  danger  to  the  republic  involved  in  setting  aside 
custom  constituting  the  only  bulwark  against  the  assaults  6f  men  whos-? 
ambition  chokes  their  patriotism  and  whose  selfish  desire  for  personal 
victory  and  power  throttles  those  moral  scruples  with  which  they  once 
have  been  endowed. 

Would  the  man  who  threw  his  hat  in  the  ring  and  sought  to  slug  his 
opponent  over  the  ropes  in  his  fight  for  a  third  term  rest  satisfied  witl: 
[his  achievement,?  Clearly  his  lust  for  power  would  have  brooked  no  such 
limitation.  A  third  term  wculd  but  have  whetted  his  desire  for  more 
and  as  the  terms  slipped  away  each  renewal  would  discover  greater  in- 
'  jury  to  our  Constitution,  to  the  form  of  government  established  under  it 
and  to  every  legal  curb  on  his  imperious  will.  This  is  the  man  who 
menaced  us  with  an  increase  of  Federal  power  by  usurpation  of  state's 
rights  and  without  authority  of  constitutional  amendment ;  the  mai&gt; 
who  took  the  Isthmus  of  Panama  "and  let  Congress  debate  about  it 
af terwards ; ' '  the  man  who,  having  enough  money  to  send  the  fleet  on 
its  famous  cruise  to  the  Pacific,  sent  it  without  sanction  of  Congress, 
leaving  it  to  appropriate  the  money  for  the  return  when  Congress 
deemed  that  necessary.  This  is  the  man  who  advocated  Federal  incor- 
poration for  the  increase  of  power  at  Washington  and  the  lightening  of 
legal  burdens  on  the  corporations;  the  man  who  authorized  the  absorp- 
tion of  the  .Tennessee  Coal  &amp;  Iron  Co.  by  the  steel  trust ;  the  man  who, 
by  many  such  drastic  acts  and  by  unnumbered  words,  has  sought  to 
batter  down  our  statutory  and  constitutional  safeguards. 

He  who  runs  may  read  the  danger  that  threatens  the  country  rule.! 
by  such  a  man.  Do  we  envy  Mexico  her  thirty  years  of  wedded  life,  or 
the  war  the  divorce  from  Diaz  precipitated,  the  end  of  which  no  man 
may  prophesy?  The  way  to  prevent  a  life  series  of  terms  is  to  prevent 
the  present  attempt  to  capture  the  office  for  a  third  term.  One  of  our 
opportunities  in  this  campaign  is  to  lead  the  fight  against  a  third 
term.  That  opportunity  should  appeal  to  every  drop  of  patriotic  blood 
flowing  in  our  veins.  [Applause.] 

Unquestionably  we  have  been  wrong  in  assuming  that  a  tradition 
against  a  third  term  constitutes  a  sufficient  safeguard  against  un 


DEMOCRATIC  XATIOXAL  COXVEXTIOX

scrupulous  ambition  for  unlimited  power.  We  need  a  definite  const! 
tutional  limitation  on  which  shall  prevent  imperialistic  souls  from  fore 
ing  personal  continuation  in  office  for  long  periods  or  for  life  and  the 
personal  selection  of  a  successor  in  office.  And  the  constitutional  pro- 
vision should  go  one  step  further  than  our  recently  assailed  tradition. 
The  provision  should  limit  to  a  single  term.  Then  will  the  occupants 
of  the  office  have  before  them  but  the  one  ambition  so  to  fulfill  the 
great  trust  reposed  in  them  that  upon  retirement  they  shall  hear  from  a 
grateful  people  the  commendation:  "Well  done,  thou  good  and  faith- 
ful servant."  [Applause.] 

In  this  great  country,  which  boasts  of  a  wealth  of  one  hundred  and 
thirty  billion  as  against  eighty  billion  for  Great  Britain  and  Ireland, 
sixty-five  billion  for  France  and  sixty  billion  for  Germany,  all  are  con- 
scious that  too  large  a  part  of  our  wealth  has  been  secured  by  a  small 
percentage  of  our  population  and  that  the  cost  of  living  rises  faster 
than  the  average  income.  [Applause.] 

The  principal  cause  of  all  this  is  to  be  found  in  the  tariff  statutes, 
and  in  the  combinations  restraining  trade  and  competition,  created  for 
the  purpose  of  wringing  from  the  republic  every  dollar  which  the  tariff 
statutes  make  possible. 

The  average  of  duties  under  the  tariff  of  1789  was  eight  and  one- 
half  per  cent.  Now  the  average  is  fifty  per  cent. 

In  1842  the  average  was  thirty-two  per  cent.  In  1846  it  was  re- 
duced to  twenty-five  per  cent,  which  worked  so  well  that  a  reduction  to 
an  average  of  twenty  per  cent  followed  in  1857. 

Probably  it  would  never  have  been  again  increased  but  for  the  war, 
for  the  census  of  1860  disclosed  a  higher  percentage  of  increase  of  the 
national  wealth  during  the  preceding  ten  years  than  for  any  other 
decade  before  or  since,  and  the  percentage  of  increase  in  capital  invested 
in  manufacturing  was  also  greater  than  during  any  similar  period  in 
our  history. 

Protected  interests  benefited  by  two  increases  during  the  war,  the 
first  to  an  average  of  thirty-seven  and  one-half  per  cent,  the  second  to 
forty-seven  per  cent.  That  high  average,  then  excused  only  by  the 
exigencies  of  the  war,  is  exceeded  now,  as  the  average  is  nearly  fifty  per 
cent. 

The  Republican  party  has  thus  geared  the  machinery  of  government 
to  enrich  the  few  at  the  expense  of  the  many.  That  increase  of  thirty 
per  cent  in  the  average  has  taken  thousands  of  millions  from  the  general 
public  and  devoted  it  to  the  creation  of  swollen  fortunes. 

An  awakening  of  the  people  led  the  Republican  National  Conven- 
tion of  1908  by  its  platform  to  promise  a  revision.  True,  it  did  not  in 
terms  promise  a  revision  of  the  tariff  downward,  but  its  assurance  of  a 
revision  of  the  tariff  by  a  special  session  of  Congress  to  be  called  im- 
mediately after  the  inauguration  of  the  next  _ president  was  interded  to 
hold  the  tariff  reduction  Republicans  in  line,  while  the  trick  in  the 


24  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

phraseology  was  to  be  made  clear  to  the  tariff  beneficiaries.     [Applause.! 

In  vain  did  the  people  demand  of  Congress  the  fulfillment  of  the 
Eepublican  pledge,  for  the  masters  of  that  party — the  protected  inter- 
ests— insisted  upon  the  pound  of  fleeh  nominated  in  the  bond.  And  it 
was  yielded.  Congress  passed  and  the  President  signed  the  Payne 
Aldrich  bill. 

One  outcome  of  this  breach  of  faith  was  a  Democratic  House,  which 
has  acted  so  wisely  and  courageously  as  to  arouse  the  enthusiasm  of 
the  people  and  inspire  the  Democratic  party  with  justifiable  hope  of 
early  opportunity  to  render  a  public  service  sorely  needed.  [Applause.! 

Under  sagacious  and  intrepid  Democratic  leadership  special  bills 
have  been  passed  having  for  their  purpose  a  revision  of  the  tariff  down- 
ward, ultimately  to  a  revenue  basis.  These  bills  are  known  as  ' '  Free 
List,  Wool,  Cotton,  Metals,  Chemicals,  Sugar  and  Excise."  The  Presi 
dent's  use  of  the  veto  power  has  postponed,  however,  the  hour  when  the 
people  shall  enter  into  the  enjoyment  of  the  relief  proposed,  until  after 
the  inauguration  of  the  next  President.  [ Applause.  1 

The  temporary  failure,  owing  to  the  action  of  the  electorate  of  Can- 
ada, of  the  effort  to  effectuate  reciprocity  with  that  country,  is  regret- 
table. The  agreement  proposed  was  in  the  interest  of  the  people  of 
both  countries. 

The  movement  started  was  in  the  right  direction,  because  it  was 
toward  a  competitive  policy.  Its  immediate  and  laudable  purpose  was  to 
lessen  the  cost  of  living  in  each  country. 

Whether  later  the  mutual  advantage  of  our  respective  people  shall 
be  appreciated  by  our  neighbors  across  the  border,  the  consciousness 
that  we  took  the  right  course  should  content  us.  In  all  probability,  how- 
ever, the  sober  second  thought  of  the  people  of  Canada  will  induce  re- 
consideration of  the  action  of  last  year.  The  temporary  reduction  of 
the  duty  on  cement  by  the  Canadian  opponents  of  reciprocity  is  signifi- 
cant of  the  results  that  in  due  course  may  be  expected. 

All  honor  to  the  Democratic  House,  which  stood  for  the  good  of 
the  nation  as  a  whole  and  prevented  the  repeal  of  the  reciprocity  act, 
thus  leaving  the  door  open  to  Canada  if  her  people  shall  later  elect  to 
accept  our  proposal.  [Applause.] 

For  the  ills  that  flow  from  that  tariff  increase  from  an  average  of 
twenty  per  cent  to  fifty,  the  Republican  party  is  responsible.  For  tho 
continuance  of  that  rate  against  the  efforts  of  a  Democratic  Congress, 
a  Republican  President  is  to  blame.  It  is  evident,  therefore,  that  relief 
can  come  only  through  the  election  of  a  Democratic  President  and  Con- 
gress. [Applause.] 

During  all  these  yeafs  of  enforced  levies  upon  the  many  for  tho 
benefit  of  the  few  it  has  been  abundantly  demonstrated  that  the  tariff 
is,  as  accurately  described  by  a  trust  magnate,  "the  fruitful  mother  of 
trusts. ' ' 

Mr.  Taft  said   in  a  speech   in  1908  that   during  the  preceding  ten 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  25 

years  nine-tenths  of  the  combinations  to  restrain  trade  had  come  into 
existence.  During  nearly  all  that  time  the  Eepublican  party  was  in 
control  of  every  northern,  eastern  and  western  state,  as  well  as  of  the 
federal  government. 

Little  was  done  by  the  party  in  power  to  retard  the  weedy  growth, 
and  that  little  feebly.  That  an  ounce  of  prevention  is  worth  a  pound  of 
cure  was  never  so  forcefully  illustrated.  The  prevention  of  combinations 
would  have  protected  all  the  people  and  harmed  none.  The  process  of 
destruction  punishes  the  innocent  investors  as  well  as  the  guilty  organ- 
izers. 

The  reason  for  the  encouraging  inactivity  of  the  Republican  officials 
is  plain.  The  tariff  beneficiaries  were  and  for  many  years  had  been 
contributors  to  campaign  funds  of  the  party,  which  in  Turn  protected 
the  special  privileges  enjoyed  by  the  donors.  But  competition  prevented 
in  some  instances  the  collection  from  the  people  of  the  full  sum  stipu- 
lated in  the  tariff.  To  secure  it  all,  tempted  the  cupidity  and  stimulated 
the  ingenuity  of  the  beneficiaries.  But  one  way  could  be  found — com- 
bination to  control  the  price  up  to  the  point  where  the  statute  let  in 
foreign  competition.  The  same  party  which  shut  out  foreign  competition 
was  found  willing  to  permit  the  formation  of  combinations  which  effec- 
tually banished  home  competition.  The  common  law  on  the  subject  and 
the  Sherman  Act  were  treated  by  Republican  officials  as  repealed  by  im- 
plication. Need  it  be  said  that  the  protected  interests,  for  these  larger 
privileges,  made  larger  contributions?  [Applause.] 

Combinations,  of  course,  multiplied  rapidly  under  such  encourage- 
ment and  stimulation,  especially  as  the  evidence  accumulated  that  the 
Executive  Department  of  government  could  be  relied  upon  for  protec- 
tion even  in  case  of  attack  by  enemies. 

We  are  indebted  to  the  President  for  the  evidence  that  his  prede- 
cessor, having  first  enjoyed  an  interview  with  George  W.  Perkins,  re- 
strained his  Attorney  General  from  bringing  suit  against  the  Harvester 
Combination.  [Applause.] 

For  the  Steel  Corporation  he  went  further,  for  he  wrote  his  Attorney 
General  in  advance  of  its  absorption  of  the  Tennessee  Coal  and  Iron 
Company  that  he  had  decided  ' '  to  interpose  no  objection. ' ' 

Indeed,  he  apparently  stood  ready  to  perform  similar  kindly  offices 
for  all  corporations,  for  he  advocated  the  passage  of  a  statute  permitting 
voluntary  submission  of  all  engaged  in  interstate  commerce  to  federal 
authority  with  the  advantage  to  them  of  immunity  from  prosecution 
because  of  contracts  made  if  stamped  in  advance  with  executive  ap- 
proval as  reasonable. 

The  view  of  executive  duty  which  these  acts  suggest  is  diametrically 
opposite  to  that  of  that  sterling  Democrat,  President  Jackson,  who 
wrote :  ' '  The  laws  of  the  United  States  must  be  executed.  I  have  no 
discretionary  power  on  the  subject;  my  duty  is  emphatically  pro- 
nounced in  the  Constitution." 


26  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

The  effect  of  these  and  similar  acts  in  the  circumstances  induced  the 
result  which  Senator  La  Follette  referred  to  in  a  recent  speech  in  these 
words :  ' '  When  Eoosevelt  became  President  the  total  amount  of  the 
stock  and  bond  issues  of  all  combinations  and  trusts,  including  the 
railways  then  in  combination,  was  only  three  billion  seven  hundred 
eighty-four  million  dollars.  When  he  turned  the  country  over  to  Taft, 
whom  he  selected  as  his  successor,  the  total  capitalization  of  the  trusts 
and  combinations  amounted  to  the  enormous  sum  of  thirty-one  billion 
six  hundred  and  seventy-two  million  dollars,  more  than  seventy  per 
cent  of  which  was  water.'5 

*—  Whatever  of  excuse  may  be  offered,  the  ugly  truth  is  that  the  Ee- 
publican  national  machine  has  received  the  moneys  of  the  corporate  and 
individual  beneficiaries  of  the  tariff  and  combinations  and  in  return 
has  compelled  Congress  to  keep  high  the  tariff  rates  and  their  attorneys 
general  to  close  their  eyes  to  violations  of  law.  Need  we  seek  further 
evidence  than  the  admission  of  President  Taft?  He  said  at  Cincin- 
nati, September  21st,  1910 :  ' '  The  country  is  roused  against  the  cor- 
porate or  corrupt  control  of  legislative  agencies. ' '  If,  however,  there 
remain  a  doubting  Thomas,  let  him  read  the  confession  of  the  only 
living  ex-President.  He  said  at  Osawatomie :  ' '  It  is  necessary  that 
laws  should  be  passed  to  prohibit  the  use  of  corporate  funds  directly 
or  indirectly  for  political  purposes;  it  is  still  more  necessary  that  such 
laws  should  be  thoroughly  enforced.  Corporate  expenditures  for  polit- 
ical purposes,  and  especially  such  expenditures  by  public  service  cor- 
porations, have  supplied  one  of  the  principal  sources  of  corruption  in 
our  political  affairs." 

In  the  light  of  all  the  testimony  and  of  these  admissions,  I  submit 
that  the  jury  of  the  people  should  find  as  a  general  verdict  ' '  That  the 
failure  of  the  executive  and  legislative  branches  of  government,  both 
federal  and  state,  to  protect  the  people  from  the  special  privilege  hunt-, 
ers  and  graft  seekers,  is  deeply  rooted  in  a  corrupt  alliance  between 
the  latter  and  the  leaders  of  the  Eepublican  party."  Upon  that  ver- 
dict but  one  judgment  can  be  entered — that  of  eviction.  When  you 
find  cancer  you  know  that  pills  and  plasters  will  serve  only  to  divert  the 
mind  of  the  patient  from  his  fate.  Pills  and  plasters  have  been  liber- 
ally and  sensationally  prescribed  for  some  years  now  by  those  Eepub- 
lican leaders  who  would  hide  from  public  gaze  the  misconduct  of  their 
party,  yet  the  cancer  is  still  growing.  We  must  cut  it  out  ere  it  is  too 
late.  [Applause.] 

Not  until  the  Special  Session  of  Congress  in  1909,  however,  did  the 
people  generally  appreciate  that  the  protected  interests  held  the  Bepub- 
lican  Congress  with  such  an  iron  grip  that  Congress  would  repudiate 
the  pledge  of  its  party  to  revise  the  tariff,  as  the  people  understood  the 
promise,  downward.  Now  the  truth  is  appreciated.  Of  that  fact  the 
election  of  an  overwhelming  Democratic  majority  to  the  present  House 
is  evidence. 


DEMOCRATIC  XATION  M.  CONVIINTION  27 

if  is  still  true,  however,  that  many  have  not  discovered  that  the 
real  power  that  chained  the  party  to  the  interests  was  money  con- 
tributed  to  help  on  campaigns  and  that,  Averse  still,  a  large  part  of  the 
money  obtained  was  not  thrust  upon  the  party  by  the  interests,  but  was 
wrung  from  them  through  organized  importunity  in  which  public  offi- 
cials took  part.  [Applause.] 

On  occasion  oven  a  President  of  the  United  States  lias  been  known 
to  solicit  the  financial  assistance  of  a  great  financial  leader  over  whose 
railroad  the  executive  department  might  hold  either  a  stern  or  a  mild 
and  gentle  sway.  The  presidential  attitude  was  gentle  and  polite,  but 
firm  and  insistent.  Several  letters  failing  to  produce  the  sheep  for  the 
shearing,  another  was  addressed  to  "My  dear  Mr.  Harriman. "  "Now. 
my  dear  sir,  you  and  I  are  practical  men,  and  you  are  on  tne  ground 
and  know  the  conditions  better  than  I  do.  If  you  think  there  is  any 
danger  of  your  visit  to  me  causing  trouble,  or  if  you  think  there  is 
nothing  special  I  need  be  informed  about,  or  no  matter  on  which  I 
could  give  aid,  why,  of  course,  give  up  the  visit  for  the  time  being,  and 
then,  in  a  few  weeks  hence,  ~before  I  write  my  message,  I  shatt  get  you 
/o  cume  down  to  discuss  certain  government  matters  not  connected  with 
the  campaign.  With  great  regards." 

The  suggestion  of  government  matters — implying  in  the  circum- 
stances railroad  matters — proved  to  be  the  proper  bait.  The  discussion 
relating  to  government  matters  has  not  yet  been  reported.  Probably  it 
never  took  place,  for  Mr.  Harriman  read  between  the  lines  of  that  letter, 
hurried  to  Washington,  hurried  back  and  promptly  raised  the  quarter 
of  a  million  demanded  with  ten  thousand  dollars  over  for  good  measure. 

This  incident  plainly  discloses  the  ligament  that  binds  the  Repub- 
lican party  to  the  interests  preying  on  the  people  and  defying  the  law. 
The  latter  furnished  the  money  with  which  the  former  debauched  the 
electorate  in  every  debatable  State.  Adams  County,  Ohio,  is  but  an 
illustration  of  the  loathsome  condition  which  resulted. 

Like  the  hypocrites  of  old,  who  loved  to  pray  standing  in  the  syna- 
gogues and  in  the  corners  of  the  streets,  who  prated  of  their  virtues 
and  gave  thanks  that  they  were  not  as  other,  men,  so  have  these  corrupt 
leaders  covered  their  vile  misdeeds  with  hypocritical  professions  of 
righteousness.  Woe  unto  you.  hypocrites,  for  ye  are  like  unto  whited 
sepulchers.  which  indeed  appear  beautiful  outward  but  are  within  full 
of  corruption  and  all  uucleanness  that  verily  smells  to  Heaven.  Your 
day  of  doom  is  at  hand! 

In  jeopardizing  our  form  of  government  and  those  dearly  bought 
liberties  which  the  Fathers  therein  secured  for  us,  the  Republican 
apostles  and  promoters  of  misrule,  federal  usurpation  and  political 
corruption  threaten  the  very  foundations  of  the  greatest  cathedral 
builded  by  modern  civilization.  The  corner-stone  of  that  temple  is 
Plymouth  Rock.  The  Declaration  of  Independence  and  our  matchless 
Constitution  are  embedded  in  the  foundations  thereof.  The  superstruc- 


t8  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

• 
ture  has  been  reared  block  by  block  with  weary  years  of  toil  by  true 

patriot  and  able  statesmen.  "Within  its  walls  every  man  may  come  to 
worship  the  one  living  and  true  God  in  such  fashion  as  his  fathers  did 
or  his  conscience  dictates.  Jew  and  Gentile,  Catholic  and  Protestant, 
Barbarian,  Scythian,  bond  and  free,  kneel  side  by  side  in  the  sacred 
calm.  In  the  outer  shadow  of  its  walls  are  clustered  schools  and  col- 
leges without  number  where  the  sons  of  the  millionaire  and  of  the  ped- 
dler from  New  York's  crowded  East  Side  alike  may  attain  the  highest 
scholarship.  Near  at  hand  are  the  marts  of  trade  where  the  heir  of  the 
financier  and  the  offspring  of  the  day  laborer,  side  by  side,  with  no 
other  limitation  than  those  fixed  by  the  personal  capacity  of  each, 
contend  for  the  prizes  of  fortune.  Stretching  to  the  western  horizon 
are  thousand,  thousand  millions  of  acres  where  the  descendants  of  the 
Mayflower  pioneers  and  the  children  of  the  emigrant  of  yesterday  may 
reap  together  the  reward  of  content  and  comfort  which  comes  to  the 
faithful  and  intelligent  tiller  of  the  soil. 

Take  the  wings  of  the  morning  and  seek  in  the  uttermost  parts  of 
the  earth  and  in  no  other  spot  shall  ye  find  such  wide  opportunity  for 
man  to  develop  the  best  that  is  in  him.  This  fair  and  noble  achievement, 
this  matchless  fabric,  illguarded,  neglected,  profaned  and  mutilated 
while  in  the  custodianship  of  Eepublican  officials,  left  open  thus  to 
attack  of  vandal  socialist  and  alien  anarchist,  is  menaced  with  destruc- 
tion. If  the  threatened  ruin  come,  the  happiness  of  the  New  World 
and  the  hope  of  the  Old  will  forever  fail  and  the  great  march  of 
modern  civilization  and  true  progress  will  be  forever  stayed. 

It  is  not  the  wild,  swirling,  cruel  methods  of  revolution  and  violence 
that  are  needed  to  correct  the  abuses  incident  to  our  government  as  to 
all  things  human.  Neither  material  nor  moral  progress  lies  that  way. 
We  have  made  our  government  and  our  complicated  institutions  by 
appeals  to  reason  seeking  to  educate  all  our  people  that,  day  after 
day,  year  after  year,  century  after  century,  they  may  see  more  clearly, 
act  more  justly,  become,  more  and  more,  attached  to  the  fundamental 
ideas  that  underlie  our  society.  If  we  are  to  preserve  undiminished 
the  heritage  bequeathed  us  and  add  to  it  those  accretions  without  which 
society  would  perish,  we  shall  need  all  the  powers  that  the  school,  the 
church,  the  deliberative  assembly  and  the  quiet  thought  of  our  people 
can  bring  to  bear. 

AVe  are  called  upon  to  do  battle  against  the  unfaithful  guardians 
of  our  constitution  and  liberties  and  the  hordes  of  ignorance  which 
are  pushing  forward  only  to  the  ruin  of  our  social  and  governmental 
fabric  and  their  own  deep  damnation. 

Too  long  has  the  country  endured  the  offences  of  the  leaders  of  a 
party  which  once  knew  greatness.  Too  long  have  we  been  blind  to  the 
bacchanal  of  corruption.  Too  long  have  we  listlessly  watched  the  as- 
sembling  of  the  forces  that  threaten  our  country  and  our  firesides. 
The  time  has  come  when  the  salvation  of  the  country  demands  the  de- 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  20 

struction  of  the-  leaders  of  a  debauched  party,  and  the  restoration  to 
place  and  power  of  men  of  high  ideals  who  will  wage  unceasing  war 
against  corruption  in  politics,  who  will  enforce  the  law  against  both 
rich  and  poor,  and  who  will  treat  guilt  as  personal  and  punish  it 
accordingly. 

For  their  crimes  against  American  citizenship  the  present  leaders 
of  the  Republican  party  should  be  destroyed. 

For  making  and  keeping  the  bargain  to  take  care  of  the  tariff  pro- 
tected interests  in  consideration  of  campaign  funds,  they  should  be 
destroyed. 

For  encouraging  the  creation  of  combinations  to  restrain  trade,  and 
refusing  to  enforce  the  law,  for  a  like  consideration,  they  should  be 
destroyed. 

For  the  lavish  waste  of  the  public  funds;  for  the  fraudulent  dis- 
position of  the  people 's  domain,  and  for  their  contribution  toward  the 
division  of  the  people  into  classes,  they  should  be  destroyed. 

For  the  efforts  to  seize  for  the  executive  department  of  the  federal 
government  powers  rightfully  belonging  to  the  States,  they  should  be 
destroyed.  [Applause.] 

And  destruction  will  be  theirs,  this  very  year,  if  we  but  do  our  duty. 

What  is  our  duty?  To  think  alike  as  to  men  and  measures?  Im- 
possible !  Even  for  our  great  party !  There  is  not  a  reactionary  among 
us.  All  Democrats  are  Progressives.  But  it  is  inevitably  human  that 
we  shall  not  all  agree  that  in  a  single  highway  is  found  the  only  road 
to  progress,  or  each  make  the  same  man  of  all  our  worthy  candidates 
his  first  choice. 

It  is  possible,  however,  and  it  is  our  duty  to  put  aside  all  selfishness, 
to  consent  cheerfully  that  the  majority  shall  speak  for  each  of  us.  and 
to  march  out  of  this  Convention  shoulder  to  shoulder  intoning  the  praises 
of  our  chosen  leader — and  that  will  be  his  due,  whichever  of  the  honor- 
able and  able  men  now  claiming  our  attention  be  chosen.  [Applause.]

APPOINTMENT  OF  COMMITTEES. 

Mn.  FRED  J.  KERN,  of  Illinois:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  roll 
of  States  and  Territories  be  now  called,  and  that  the  names  of  the  per- 
sons selected  by  the  respective  delegations  to  serve  on  the  several  com-

and  that  the  committees  as  thus  constituted  be  the  standing  committees 
of  this  convention. 

MR.  CHARLES  W.  GREENE,  of  Rhode  Island:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  desire 
to  offer  an  amendment  to  the  resolution  submitted  by  the  gentleman 
from  Illinois  (Mr.  Kern).  The  amendment  is  to  add  at  the  end  of  the 
resolution  the  following: 


DEMOCRATIC  XATIOXAL  COXVEXTION  33 

"And  that  all  resolutions  relating  to  the  plat.form,  and  all  com- 
munications addressed  to  the  Convention  be  referred  without  reading 
or  debate  to  the  Committee  on  Platform,  and  that  the  credentials  of

dentials from  such  delegation. ' ' 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  is  on  the  amendment 
offered  by  the  gentleman  from  Ehode  Island  (Mr.  Greene)  to  the 

resolution  of  the  gentleman  from  Illinois   (Mr.  Kern). 

^ 
MR.  E.  J.  GIDDINGS,  of  Oklahoma :      Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  me 

there  are  two  motions  before  the  house,  one  that  of  the  gentleman 
from  Illinois  (Mr.  Kern),  and  the  other  that  of  the  gentleman  from 
Ehode  Island  (Mr.  Greene).  Which  are  we  to  vote  on,  and  by  which 
are  we  to  be  governed?  I  ask  for  information. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  is  on  the  amendment  of 
the  gentleman  from  Ehode  Island  (Mr.  Greene)  to  the  resolution  of  the 
gentleman  from  Illinois. 

The  amendment  was  agreed  to. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the 
resolution  of  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  Kern)  as  amended. 

The  resolution  as  amended  was  agreed  to. 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  STONE,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  understand 
the  resolution  now  before  the  Convention  provides  for  the  appointment 
of  members  on  the  committees  on  credentials,  permanent  organization, 
rules  and  order  of  business,  platform  and  resolutions.  Is  that  correct? 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :     That  is  correct. 

MR.  STONE,  of  Missouri:  In  order  to  expedite  business,  I  move  as 
an  amendment  to  the  resolution  that  when  the  states  are  called,  in 
addition  to  naming  the  committeemen  suggested,  they  also  name  their 
committeemen  to  notify  the  candidate  for  President  and  the  candidate 
for  Vice-President,  their  honorary  vice-presidents  of  the  convention, 
and  their  national  committeemeu. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :  Does  the  gentleman  offer  it  as  an 
independent  resolution? 

MR.  STONE,  of  Missouri:     Xo,  I  offer  it  as  an  amendment. 

MK.  FITZGERALD,  of   New   York:      The  resolution  has  been  adopted. 

MR.  STONE,  of  Missouri :  Then  I  will  offer  mine  as  an  independent 
motion. 

THE  TEMPORARY   CHAIRMAN:      What   is  the  gentleman's  motion? 

MR.  STONE,  of  Missouri:  I  move  that  in  addition  to  the  naming  of 
the  committeemen  from  the  different  States  on  the  standing  committees 
of  the  Convention,  when  the  roll  of  States  is  called  the  States  also 
name  the  committeemen  from  the  several  States  to  notify  the  candidates 
for  President  and  Vice  -President,  the  honorary  vice-presidents  of  the 
Convention,  and  the  national  committeemen,  so  that  we  can  be  through 
with  them  all  at  once.

SECOND   DAY 


CONVENTION  HALL, 
FIFTH  MARYLAND  EEGIMENT  ARMORY, 

BALTIMORE,  MD.,  June  26,  191-2. 
The  Convention  met  at  12   o'clock  m. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Chair  presents  the  Rt.  Eev.  John 
Gardner  Murray,  Bishop  of  Maryland,  who  will  offer  prayer. 

PEAYER  OF  RT.  RKV.  JOHN*  GARDNER  MURRAY,  D.  D.,  BISHOP 
OF    MARYLAND. 

Rt.  Rev.  John  Gardner  Murray,  D.  D.,  Bishop  of  Maryland,  offered 
the  following  prayer: 

O  Almighty  and  Eternal  God,  Heavenly  Father,  Thou  Who  art  the 
Author  of  all  life  and  the  lawful  Ruler  of  all  mankind,  we  bow  in  Thy 
Presence,  recognizing  Thy  supreme  sovereignty  over  us,  acknowledging 
our  utter  dependence  upon  Thee,  and  praying  for  Thy  blessing  of  help 
and  favor  upon  this  Convention,  upon  our  land  and  people,  and  upon 
all  in  authority  in  our  nation. 

Assembled  here  today,  we  stand  face  to  face  with  the  most  momen- 
tous crisis  in  the  history  of  our  great  Government,  but  Thou  art  the 
fountain  of  all  wisdom,  Thou  art  the  source  of  all  knowledge,  Thou  art 
the  Tower  of  all  strength;  and  in  this  hour  of  solemn  obligation  anil 
wonderful  opportunity,  in  our  insufficiency  we  come  to  Thee  for  wis- 
dom, in  our  ignorance  we  come  to  Thee  for  knowledge,  and  in  our 
weakness  we  come  to  Thee  for  strength.  And  we  thus  come  all  the 
more  confidently  ami  with  the  more  perfect  assurance  because  as  in  the 
[Hist  Thou  hast  been  our  fathers'  God,  so  in  the  present  art  Thou  our 
God  too. 

Let  not,  we  pray  Thee,  in  our  discussion,  the  hand  of  pride,  preju- 
dice or  passion  come  nigh  to  hurt  us,  nor  the  foot  of  the  ungodly  to 
east  us  down ;  but  in  the  expression  of  Thy  great  love  for  this  people 
which  Thou  hast  raised  up  and  made  mighty  among  the  nations  of  earth, 
wilt  Thou  so  control  the  mind  and  direct  the  will  of  this  body  that  all 
its  deliberations  shall  make  for  the  more  abundant  life  of  the  gospel  of 
prosperity  and  peace  in  our  every  social,  civic  and  economic  relation- 
ship and  sphere.  And  wilt  Thou  grant  that  upon  whomsoever  the  Presi- 
dential and  Vice  Presidential  nomination  mantles  of  this  Convention 
shall  fall,  may  they  be  patriotic,  God-fearing  and  God-serving  men  of

42  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

personal  purity  and  public  virtue;  so  that  by  our  final  action  we  shall 
not  only  serve  our  party  but  also  honor  our  country  and  supremely 
glorify  Thee  our  Governor  and  our  God. 

All  which  we  ask  through  Jesus  Christ  our  Lord,  Who  hast  taught  us 
when  we  pray  to  say,  Our  Father,  Who  art  in  heaven,  hallowed  by  Thy 
Name!  Thy  kingdom  come;  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth  as  it  is  in 
heaven.  Give  us  this  day  our  daily  bread,  and  forgive  us  our  tres- 
passes as  we  forgive  those  who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not 
into  temptation,  but  deliver  us  from  evil.  For  Thine  is  the  kingdom 
and  the  power  and  the  glory  forever  and  ever.  Amen. 

COMMITTEE   ON  CREDENTIALS. 

MR.  NEWTON  C.  BLANCHARB,  of  Louisiana:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am 
directed  by  the  Committee  on  Credentials  to  report  to  this  Convention 
that  it  has  not  yet  completed  its  labors,  and  will  require  the  time  from 
now  until  eight  o'clock  tonight  to  do  so.  I  will  not  move  that  the  con- 
vention now  take  a  recess  until  8  o'clock,  for  I  know  those  present 
would  like  a  display  of  oratory,  but  I  do.  move  that  when  the  conven- 
tion takes  a  recess,  it  be  to  meet  at  8  o'clock  tonight. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

SPEECH  OF  JOSEPH  W.  FOLK. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  Gentlemen  of  the  convention,  I  have 
great  pleasure  in  introducing  to  you  ex-Governor  Folk  of  Missouri. 

MR.  JOSEPH  W.  FOLK,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  and  fellow 
Democrats,  the  nominee  of  this  convention  will  be  the  next  President 
of  the  United  States.  [Applause.] 

In  1908  at  Denver  we  nominated  a  ticket  that  was  defeated.  I  be- 
lieve I  can  safely  say  that  the  man  who  did  most  to  defeat  Mr.  Bryan 
in  that  campaign  will  now  admit  he  made  a  mistake  in  not  advising  the 
people  to  accept  Mr.  Bryan  and  to  reject  Mr.  Taft.  You  may  not  agree 
with  Mr.  Bryan  in  all  of  his  ideas,  but  no  one  can  deny  that  he  has 
been  the  greatest  moral  teacher  of  this  generation.  [Applause.]  That 
ticket  was  not  elected,  but  in  1910  the  people  elected  a  Democratic, 
lower  House  of  Congress,  and  that  lower  House  proceeded -to  carry  out. 
_eyery  plank  of  the  Denver  platform  as  far  as  it  was  able. 

That  platform  declared  for  the  election  of  United  States  Senators 
by  direct  vote  of  the  people,  and  a  Democratic  House  has  aided  in  sub- 
mitting &amp;n  amendment  for  the  election  of  Senators  by  the  people.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

That  platform  declared  for  an  income  tax,  and  a  Democratic  House 
aided  in  submitting  an  amendment  for  an  income  tax. 

That  platform  declared  for  the  overthrow  of  Cannonism,  and  a  Demo- 
cratic House,  under  the  leadership  of  a  great  Democratic  speaker,  has 
restored  representative  government.  [Applause.] 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  '43 

Let  us  in  this  Convention  nominate  a  progressive  Democrat  for  j 
President.  Let  us  adopt  a  progressive  Democratic  platform.  Let  us  * 
declare  that  we  are  not  opposed  to  wealth  honestly  acquired,  but  that 
we  propose  to  wage  unending  war  against  the  privileges  that  produce 
tainted  riches  on  one  side  and  undeserved  poverty  on  the  other.  [Ap- 
plause.] Let  us  announce  that  we  will  protect  property  rights,  but  let 
us  recognize  the  principle  that  property  rights  ought  not  to  be  incon- 
sistent with  human  rights.  Let  us  recognize  vested  rights,  but  let  us 
deny  that  there  can  be  any  such  thing  as  a  vested  wrong.  [Applause.] 
Let  us  not  array  class  against  class,  but  let  us  preserve  the  rights  of  all 
by  causing  each  to  respect  the  rights  of  the  other.  Let  us  seek  as  a 
remedy  for  exist  ing  wrongs,  not  alone  government  by  the  people,  but 
more  government  by  the  people.  Let  us  not  ask  anyone  to  join  us 
because  we  can  give  him  a  privilege,  a  subsidy  or  a  bounty,  enabling 
him  to  make  money  at  the  expense  of  his  fellow  men,  but  let  us  guar- 
antee to  all  an  equal  opportunity  to  live  and  labor,  and  to  enjoy  the 
fruits  of  honest  toil.  [Applause.]  Let  us  make  it  plain  to  the  people 
of  this  nation  that  the  Democratic  party  stands  not  only  for  govern- 
ment of  the  people  and  by  the  people,  but  government  for  the  people. 
[Applause.] 

SPEECH  OF  ISIDOR  RAYNER, 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  We  have  just  heard  the  distinguished 
young  ex-governor  of  Missouri,  and  we  will  now  have  the  pleasure  of 
listening  to  one  of  the  leaders  of  the  democracy,  a  citizen  of  this  good 
State  and  a  resident  of  the  city  which  is  now  entertaining  us,  Senator 
Isidor  Rayner.  [Applause.] 

MR.  ISIDOR  RAYNER,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  ladies  and  gen- 
tlemen, we  will  have  before  us  this  fall  three  different  parties.  The 
Republican  party  has  nominated  Mr.  Taft.  The  motto  of  that  party 
will  be.  practically,  "We  will  react  and  retrograde."  A  new  party  will 
j  e'-hat  s  arise  in  a  month  from  now  that  has  already  announced  its 
motto,  and  that  motto  is  ' '  Thou  shalt  not  steal. ' ' 

My  friends,  there  is  but  one  motto  for  us  to  announce  and  that  motto 
is  "We  shall  progress."  [Applause.]  Under  that  motto  this  inspiring 
scene  here  today  foreshadows  our  coming  victory  in  November.  [Ap- 
plause.] Our  hosts  are  in  the  field.  We  are  ready  for  the  battle.  There 
is  no  subterfuge  upon  our  banner.  We  are  not  ashamed  of  our  record, 
and  we  are  proud  of  the  colors  we  hope  to  plant  upon  the  citadel  of  the 
foe.  [Applause.] 

Now,  around  what  issues  shall  the  conflict  wage?  First  and  fore- 
most upon  our  banners  is  our  historic  emblem  that  this  is  a  government 
of  the  people  and  that  there  is  no  authority  conferred  by  the  Federal 
Constitution  to  impose  upon  the  people  of  this  Union  any  tribute  or 
burden  that  is  not  necessary  to  carry  out  the  purpose  of  government 
honestly  administered.  [Applause.] 


44  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

The  Republican  party  is  the  party  of  the  classes,  and  upon  its  ban- 
ners in  blazing  letters  is  its  motto  of  protection  to  the  American  mo- 
nopolists. The  Democratic  party  is  in  favor  of  a  constitutional  tariff 
for  revenue.  [Applause.]  The  Republican  party  is  in  favor  of  an 
unconstitutional  tariff  for  protection. 

A  man  cannot  be  a  Democrat  and  be  a  protectionist.  If  he  is  for 
protection  he  is  against  his  party  upon  the  principal  issue  that  divides 
the  parties.  This  must  be  one  of  our  issues;  shadows  have  crossed  its 
path,  but  we  must  rekindle  it  and  keep  its  fires  burning.  The  people 
are  with  us  upon  this  issue.  They  will  tear  the  mask  from  those  who 
have  robbed  them  and  the  truth  shall  be  revealed.  They  will  demand 
a  return  of  the  plunder.  They  will  demand  that  American  ports  shall 
be  reasonably  open  for  the  commerce  of  mankind.  They  will  march 
toward  the  citadel  within  which  monopoly  lies  intrenched,  and  if  we 
maintain  the  courage  of  our  convictions  that  citadel  will  be  stormed 
and  upon  its  ruins,  by  the  intelligent  suffrages  of  our  countrymen  we 
shall  again  be  called  upon  to  shape  and  guide  the  destinies  of  the 
republic.  [Applause.] 

Now,  my  friends,  I  will  pass  quickly  to  another  issue.  We  must 
oppose  with  every  lawful  means  within  our  power  these  unlawful  combi- 
nations of  centralized  wealth  that  are  oppressing  the  consumers  of  this 
country.  If  they  accomplished  any  good  whatever  I  would  be  in  favor 
of  withdrawing  all  opposition  to  them.  If,  by  extending  their  opera- 
tions, they  lowered  prices,  if  they  increased  wages,  if  they  contributed 
in  any  manner  to  the  welfare  or  prosperity  of  the  country,  I  would  say 
let  them  advance  with  steady  step  and  plant  their  acquisitions  in  every 
commonwealth  over  the  undisputed  territory  of  the  Union. 

But  they  do  no  one  of  these  things.  They  raise  prices;  they  lower 
wages;  they  limit  production;  they  monopolize  the  wealth  of  the  land. 
They  withdraw  it  from  the  channels  of  circulation,  and  in  their  grasp 
and  greed  for  profit  and  for  power  they  despoil  the  earnings  and  im- 
poverish the  homes  of  our  countrymen.  We  must  raise  our  standard  against 
them  in  every  form ;  not  characterize  some  of  them  as  good  and  denounce 
others  of  them  as  bad. 

As  in  days  gone  by  the  merchant  guilds  and  the  craft  guilds  of 
England  compelled  an  English  king  upon  the  field  of  Runnymede  to 
sign  the  parchment  of  English  liberty,  so  the  business  honor  and  the 
commercial  integrity  of  this  land,  speaking  through  the  Democratic 
party  and  through  that  party  alone,  will  compel  monopoly  to  lower  its 
standard,  to  recognize  the  rights  of  its  victims,  and  will  drive  it  from 
the  throne  it  has  erected  upon  the  wants  of  penury  and  the  toil  of 
unrequited  labor. 

Another  thing.  We  must  protect  the  rights  of  the  States  against  the 
invasion  of  Federal  power.  I  am  a  States'  rights  Democrat.  The 
Democratic  party  cannot  be  born  again.  It  must  cling  to  its  historic 
principles  or  it  must  abandon  its  historic  name.  [Applause.]  It  can- 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  45 

not  come  into  power  as  an  annex  to  the  Eepublican  party.  If  this  is 
not  Democracy,  then  I  know  not  what  I  am.  We  are  the  Democracy  of 
the  Constitution.  We  must  .gather  around  it  and  preserve  it  inviolate 
and  intact,  and  we  must  once  and  forever  impress  upon  the  people  that 
this  sacred  instrument  must  be  kept  intact  as  handed  down  to  us  by 
Madison,  by  Randolph,  by  Pinckney  and  by  Rutledge.  [Applause.] 

We  must  preserve  inviolate  the  distinction  between  legislative  and 
executive  powers,  and  we  must  see  to  it  that  no  President  of  the  United 
States  shall  ever  again  dare  to  invade  the  legislative  department  of  the 
Government.  [Applause.]  It  is  this  imperishable  distinction  that  has 
made  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  read  in  every  place  where 
political  science  is  taught.  [Applause.] 

Not  only  this,  but  it  is  perused  by  tyrants  upon  their  trembling 
thrones,  and  today,  in  lands  that  have  been  under  the  dominion  of 
despots,  it  is  an  object  lesson,  as  the  dawn  of  republican  government 
is  breakirsg  in  upon  those  benighted  spheres.  It  is  studied  in  the  camp 
of  the  revolutionist,  and  by  the  glimmering  light  in  the  dungeon  of  the 
political  convict,  and  by  exiled  philosophers  in  penal  colonies.  This 
distinction  is  the  arch  that  sustains  and  spans  the  bridge  of  the  consti- 
tution. Touch  not  the  arch.  If  we  do,  the  fabric  will  haste  to  swift 
decay.  Keep  the  keystone  inviolate  and  intact;  see*  to  it  that  no  sacri- 
legious hand  shall  hew  it  down ;  and  the  whole  majestic  structure  ' '  shall 
time  defy,  as  rocks  resist  the  billows  and  the  sky."  [Applause.] 

One  more  point.  We  must  declare  in  favor  of  the  election  of 
United  States  Senators  by  the  people.  [Applause.]  If  the  people  have 
not  enough  intelligence  to  elect  their  United  States  Senators,  then  free- 
dom is  a  dream  and  this  republic  is  a  failure.  [Applause.] 

We  must  declare  in  favor  of  primary  elections  by  the  people.  [Ap- 
plause.] Whenever  the  people  have  a  right  to  elect,  they  shall  have  the 
right  to  nominate  their  public  servants.  I  know  it  is  said  in  some  quar- 
ters that  this  will  put  incompetent  men  in  public  office.  Mr.  Chairman, 
I  am  not  afraid  to  trust  the  people  of  these  United  States.  [Applause.] 

The  rising  generation  is  a  generation  of  intelligence.  From  the 
ranks  of  educated  labor,  from  our  colleges  and  universities  they  come 
with  thoughtful  ballots,  with  free  ballots  and  with  ballots  that  are  not 
for  sale.  They  understand  these  questions  just  as  well  as  we  do,  and 
if  we  decide  them  wrong  they  will  decide  them  right. 

Let  us  stand  by  the  doctrines  and  by  the  faith  and  by  the  creed  of 
our  fathers,  and  I  have  no  doubt  of  the  success  of  our  party.  We  will 
weather  the  storm  as  we  have  weathered  the  storms  of  a  century.  It 
may  be  necessary  to  jettison  a  part  of  our  cargo,  but,  armed  and 
equipped  with  the  honor  and  courage  and  manhood  of  the  nation,  we 
are  making  for  the  harbor,  the  Democratic  ship  of  state  is  safe  and  we 
will  defiantly  surmount  the  tumult  of  the  tempest  ami  the  violence  of 
the  storm.  [Applause.] 


46  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

SPEECH   OF  HENRY  D.   CLAYTON. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  ^now 
have  the  pleasure  of  introducing  to  you  the  gentleman  who  four  years 
ago  was  the  Permanent  Chairman  of  your  Convention  at  Denver,  and 
who  has  rendered  to  the  people  of  this  country  and  to  the  great  Demo- 
cratic party  most  magnificent  service  as  chairman  of  the  Judiciary 
Committee  of  the  Democratic  House  of  Representatives,  Hon.  Henry 
D.  Clayton,  of  Alabama. 

MR.  CLAYTON,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  Ladies  and  Gentlemen — 
In  the  beginning  of  this  address,  which  shall  be  brief,  I  have  mentioned 
the  ladies,  and  to  them  let  me  here  and  now  appeal  for  support  of  our 
nominees  in  the  coming  November  election.  [Applause.]  Let  me 
hazard  the  prediction  that  the  great  majority  of  good  and  thoughtful 
women  of  those  States  of  the  Union  where  women  are  given  the  fran- 
chise will  east  their  votes  for  the  candidates  selected  by  this  convention. 
[Applause.]  And  let  me  also  predict  that  the  majority  of  those  good 
women  of  the  United  States  who  happen  to  be  married  will  compel 
their  husbands  to  vote  the  Democratic  ticket  at  the  next  election.  If 
a  woman  can  vote,  let  her  vote  the  Democratic  ticket.  If  she  herself 
cannot  vote,  let  her  make  her  old  man  and  her  boys  vote  the  Demo- 
cratic ticket.  I  am  for  that  sort  of  woman  suffrage.  [Applause.] 

My  friends,  the  country  is  treated  to  a  remarkable  but  nevertheless 
to  us  an  enjoyable  spectacle  this  year — that  is,  a  divided  and  well  nigh 
disintegrated  Republican  party.  Confessedly  the  Republican  party  has 
always  been  the  party  to  promote  and  care  for  special  interests  at 
the  expense  of  the  masses,  and  what  is  left  of  it  now  is  the  remnant 
of  a  subservient  selfish  and  discredited  business  organization  and  not 
a  political  party.  The  doctrines  of  the  Democratic  party,  as  a  result 
of  its  teachings  during  the  last  sixteen  years,  began  to  permeate  Repub- 
lican strongholds  in  the  West  and  in  the  East  since  the  last  quadrennial- 
election.  There  are  now  near  Democrats  in  Kansas  and  other  States 
calling  themselves  Insurgent  Republicans.  They  are  sensible  enough 
but  not  yet  quite  brave  enough  to  call  themselves  Democrats.  We  have 
every  reason  to  believe  that  thousands  of  such  Republicans  will  be 
patriotic  enough  and  courageous  enough  next  fall  to  vote  the  Democratic 
ticket  from  top  to  bottom. 

Mr.  Roosevelt  .is  right  when  he  says  that  Mr.  Taft  should  not  be 
elected  this  year,  and  Mr.  Taft  is  everlastingly  right  when  he  says 
that  Mr.  Roosevelt  should  be  defeated  in  his  mad  effort  to  obtain  a 
third  term  as  President. 

The  Republican  party  of  special  privilege  must  and  will  be  driven 
from  place  and  power.  The  compact  organization  which  it  has  here- 
tofore maintained  through  protectionism  has  been  broken.  The  Ameri- 
can people  understand  better  than  ever  heretofore  the  hurtful  things 
for  which  that  party  gtands.  The  next  election  is  not  to  be  bought 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  47 

with  the  campaign  contributions  of  protected  interests  or  of  monopolies. 
We  know  that  our  distinguished  Temporary  Chairman,  Judge  Parker, 
was  deprived  of  a  rightful  election  by  the  contribution  of  New  York 
insurance  companies  and  ' '  My  Dear  Harriman ' '  and  other  corporation 
magnates  who  responded  to  the  ' '  practical ' '  requests  of  Mr.  Boosevelt. 
We  know  that  these  same  influences  contributed  to  Democratic  defeat 
in  1908  and  thwarted  the  righteous  judgment  of  the  American  people. 

Let  me  congratulate  you  upon  the  unity  of  the  Democratic  party, 
and  let  us  felicitate  ourselves  upon  the  fact  that  the  country  now 
understands  better  than  ever  before  what  are  the  desires  and  purposes 
of  our  party. 

What  the  Democratic  House  has  done  at  Washington  furnishes 
assurance  of  what  our  party  will  do  when  in  control  of  the  Federal 
Government.  The  ^Democrats  of  the  House  of  Bepresentatives  and  their 
Democratic  brethren  in  the  Senate  have  endeavored  to  redeem  their 
every  campaign  pledge  and  have  been  guided  by  wise  and  constructive 
statesmanship.  Let  me  mention  a  few  of  the  things  which  the  Demo- 
crats in  Congress  have  accomplished :  Campaign  contributions  and 
expenses  must  now,  under  Democratic  law,  be  made  public  before  as 
well  as  after  the  election.  The  lavish  use  of  money  can  no  longer,  as 
we  believe,  debauch  our  elections  in  many  sections  of  the  Union.  The 
original  and  long-time  Democratic  demand  for  the  direct  election  of 
United  States  Senators  has  passed  the  Democratic  House  and  it  is 
believed  will  at  no  distant  date  become  a  part  of  the  organic  law  of 
the  Union.  The  committing  of  the  election  of  Senators  to  the  direct 
vote  of  the  people  will  not  perhaps  eradicate  all  the  abuses  which  have 
often  characterized  Senatorial  elections;  but  this  Constitutional  amend- 
ment and  other  wholesome  legislation  and  enlightened  public  sentiment 
will  reduce  to  a  minimum  the  corrupt  misuse  of  money  in  Senatorial 
elections.  The  people  can  be  safely  trusted  to  elect  their  Senators  and 
by  bringing  the  representatives  of  the  people  nearer  to  the  people  them- 
selves much  will  be  done  to  make  our  Government  a  truly  representative 
Democracy. 

The  Democrats  in  the  House  and  in  the  Senate  have  passed  measures 
revising  the  Bepublican  tariff  down  to  a  revenue  basis.  To  those  who 
might  declare  that  we  have  not  cut  as  deep  as  we  ought  to  have  cut  we 
need  only  to  say  that  all  the  high  tariff  Bepublicans  in  Congress  voted 
against,  and  even  the  Bepublican  President,  who  claims  to  be  only  a 
moderate  protectionist,  vetoed  them.  The  Democratic  House  has  passed 
an  excise  bill  in  the  nature  of  an  income  tax.  It  is  not  too  much  to 
hope  that  the  day  is  not  far  distant  when  the  eight  more  States  neces- 
sary will  ratify  the  amendment  to  the  Constitution  authorizing  the 
imposition  of  an  income  tax  without  apportionment.  When  the  time 
shall  come  the  Democratic  party  will  lift  from  the  consumers  of  this 
land  a  part  of  the  onerous  taxation  which  now  oppresses  them  and  lay 
it  where  it  justly  should  be  laid — upon  those  whose  abundant  incomes

enable  them  to  pay  it  without  lessening  even  the  luxuries  which  they 
enjoy. 

No  machine  or  steam  roller  has  determined  the  personnel  of  the 
delegates  of  this  convention.  No  committee  has  fixed  in  advance  of  this 
convention  a  plan  for  the  nomination  of  any  particular  man.  You  do 
not  now  know  nor  do  I  know  upon  whom  the  nomination  of  this  con- 
ventin  for  President  will  fall.  [Applause.] 

(At  this  point  a  demonstration  occurred.) 

ME.  CLAYTON,  of  Alabama:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  a  few 
moments  ago  I  told  you  that  you  did  not  know  and  I  did  not  know  who 
this  convention  will  nominate.  Permit  me  now  to  tell  you  what  I  do 
know,  and  that  is  that  this  convention  will  select  the  next  President  of 
the  United  States.  [Applause.]  We  are  here  for  a  more  momentous 
purpose  than  the  mere  nomination  of  a  candidate.*  We  have  met  to 
name  the  next  President  of  the  United  States,  for  the  people  will  ratify 
our  nomination  in  November  next,  and  it  matters  not  where  we  may  go 
to  get  our  candidate.  [Applause.]  In  the  coming  campaign  the  most 
fruitful  subject  of  discussion  and  of  controversy  will  be  the  tariff 
and  other  bills  passed  by  the  Democratic  House  at  Washington.  That 
House,  aided  by  those  of  like  faith  in  the  Senate,  passed  remedial  meas- 
ures in  behalf  of  the  people.  The  Bepublican  President,  now  the  Repub- 
lican nominee,  vetoed  those  measures.  The  man  who  penned  those 
reform  measures  which  have  been  vetoed  by  the  Eepublican  President 
and  the  man  who  guided  the  Democratic  House  bears  an  illustrious 
name  which  will  be  a  household  word  in  the  next  campaign;  and  when 
the  roll  call  of  States  is  had  in  this  convention,  Alabama  will  respond 
with  her  own  beloved  Underwood.  [Applause.] 

SPEECH  OF  THOMAS  P.  EILEY. 

MR.  THOMAS  P.  EILEY,  of  Massachusetts:  My  fellows  of  the  great 
Democratic  Convention,  it  is  indeed  a  swTeet  pleasure  for  me,  coming 
from  Massachusetts,  to  sound  here  the  note  that  has  been  ringing 
through  our  great  commonwealth  for  over  two  years.  We  have  been 
doing  in  our  commonwealth  as  a  party  what  we  expect  our  great  party 
in  this  nation  will  do.  We  have  been  demonstrating  the  fact  that 
political  representatives,  whether  they  be  delegates  to  conventions 
assembled,  or  selectmen  of  small  towns,  or  aldermen  of  cities,  or  Bep- 
resentatives  in  State  legislatures,  or  Bepresentatives  and  Senators  in  the 
great  National  Congress,  are  servants  of  the  people  and  must  not  be 
tools  of  interests.  [Applause.]  We  have  learned  the  lesson  in  this 
way:  We  have  learned  that  the  great  problems  of  government  are  all 
fought  out  on  a  great  basic  battlefield,  and  that  every  fight  is  a  fight 
of  the  dollar  on  one  side  against  the  enfranchised  voter  on  the  other. 
[Applause.]  So  far  we  have  found  that  this  fight  does  not  rage  and 
wage  principally  against  the  voter,  but  it  wages  for  the  vote  of  the 
representative.  The  dollar  seeking  legislative  favor,  which  it  should  not 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  49 

get,  seeks  to  seduce  the  man  who  in  a  representative  capacity  has  the 
opportunity  and  the  power  to  give  improper  and  undeserved  favor, 
while  the  voter  on  the  other  hand  seeks  to  keep  his  representative  true 
to  the  toiling  millions  that  the  voter  himself  represents. 

We  have  learned  this  lesson — that  it  takes  from  ten  to  twenty-five 
years  for  the  great  public  mind,  represented  by  the  voters,  to  come  to 
the  same  degree  of  knowledge  of  public  things  and  of  civil  questions 
that  is  already  acquired  and  enjoyed  by  the  specially  trained  minds  of 
political  leaders;  and  we  have  learned  that  in  the  first  phase  of  the 
battle,  wherein  the  dollar,  seeking  legislative  favor,  is  ranged  up  against 
the  voter — where  the  voter  demands  that  men,  women  and  children  to 
the  number  of  millions  in  this  great  country  shall  receive  consideration 
at  the  hands  of  legislators,  where  efforts  have  been  made  to  secure  leg- 
islation for  shorter  hours,  eight  hours  for  public  employees,  considera- 
tion for  women  and  children,  workmen  's  compensation  laws,  and  so  on — 
where  these  great  battles  have  been  fought,  we  have  found  in  Massa- 
chusetts that  after  the  public  mind  had  become  awakened  as  to  what 
was  the  proper  thing,  it  took  only  five  minutes  of  debate,  where  ten 
years  before  it  had  taken  three  hours  of  debate  even  to  get  a  hearing. 

Great  corporations  doing  business  by  virtue  of  the  generosity  and 
good  will  of  millions  of  people,  through  franchises  obtained  from  the 
people's  representatives,  have  denied  consideration  to  those  millions 
of  people  through  the  misuse  of  the  franchise  thus  obtained,  and  in 
the  battle  of  the  dollar  against  the  voter  we  have  found  in  Massa- 
chusetts that  the  people  have  awakened  to  the  fact  that  great  public 
service  corporations  must  give  due  regard  to  safety  of  life  and  prop- 
erty; that  in  return  for  the  privilege  of  carrying  passengers  and  freight 
they  must  have  their  trains  properly  equipped,  that  they  must  abolish 
unreasonably  dangerous  grade  crossings,  that  they  must  have  their 
rolling  stock  equipped  with  proper  safety  devices,  that  they  must  have 
adequate  crews  on  their  trains,  and  we  have  found  that  the  people  are 
awakened  to  the  question  of  what  is  right  in  those  matters. 

We  have  found  that  the  people  of  Massachusetts  have  awakened  to 
the  rectitude,  the  desirability,  the  propriety  and  the  necessity  for  a 
return  of  the  functions  of  government  back  into  the  hands  of  the  people 
from  whom  it  had  been  stolen,  and  Massachusetts  has  spoken  for  direct 
primaries,  the  direct  election  of  United  States  Senators,  direct  legis- 
lation and  other  similar  things. 

We  have  learned  this  lesson  in  Massachusetts.  I  hope  and  trust 
we  are  not  going  to  see  this  great  convention  adjourn  without  giving 
evidence  th,at  it  has  learned  the  same  lesson.  We  have  learned  that 
men  are  necessary,  as  well  as  measures.  We  have  learned  that  the 
people  can  take  care  of  measures,  and  we  want  men  whom  we  know  to 
be  properly  equipped  in  heart  as  well  as  in  head. 

When  we  came  down  here  from  Massachusetts  we  came  with  holy 
principles.  Massachusetts,  which  had  been  seeking  the  right  man, 


50  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

looked  all  over  the  field.  We  found  many  men,  but  we  found  only 
one  who  had  stood  all  the  tests — old  Champ  Clark,  of  Missouri. 
[Applause.]  • 

SPEECH   OF   THOMAS   P.   GOKE. 

Mi;.  THOMAS  P.  GORE,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman  and  Fellow 
Democrats,  this  Convention  has  assembled  to  nominate  the  next  Presi- 
dent of  the  United  States.  [Applause.]  This  Convention  is  at  once 
a  pledge  and  a  prophecy  of  Democratic  triumph,  just  as  the  Repub- 
lican  ghost  dance  at  Chicago  was  a  foreshadowing  of  Eepublican  dis- 
aster and  defeat.  The  Democracy  has  only  to  deserve  success  in  order 
to  achieve  Success.  We  have  only  to  reconsecrate  ourselves  unto  the 
faith  of  the  fathers.  We  have  only  to  reconsecrate  ourselves  to  those 
mighty  principles  which  have  made  this  Republic  the  brightest  jewel 
that  ever  flashed  upon  the  skeleton  hand  of  time. 

My  fellow  Democrats,  let  us  have  peace.  Let  us  have  peace  at  any 
price,  at  any  sacrifice  save  only  that  of  honor.  [Applause.]  Let  us 
here  and  now  put  every  Democrat  under  bond  to  keep  the  peace.  Let 
us  levy  a  prohibitive  tariff  upon  the  apples  of  discord.  [Applause.] 

"Divide  and  conquer"  was  the  maxim  which  carried  the  Koman 
arms  and  the  Koman  eagles  from  the  rising  to  the  setting  sun.  While 
Eepublicans  divide,  let  Democrats  unite,  multiply  and  conquer.  A 
house  divided  against  itself  cannot  stand.  The  Kepublican  party  cannot 
endure  half  slave  and  half  free,  half  progressive  and  half  reactionary, 
half  living  and  half  dead.  [Applause.] 

Nothing  can  rescue  the  Republican  party  froin  self -slaughter  except- 
ing only  Democratic  suicide;  nothing,  unless  the  Democracy,  like  a 
shorn  and  blinded  Samson,  should  pull  down  the  temple  upon  the  altars 
of  its  own  faith. 

Theodore  Roosevelt  undertook  to  breathe  the  breath  of  life  and  the 
spirit  of  modern  progress  into  the  petrified  remains  of  the  Republican 
party,  but  the  mummy  would  not  stir.  [Applause.]  The  heartbeat  of 
human  sympathy  was  still.  From  the  voiceless  lips  of  the  unreplying 
dead  there  came  no  word.  Let  Mr.  Roosevelt  learn,  let  this  convention 
teach  him  and  teach  the  republic  that  it  is  the  Democracy  and  not  the 
Republican  party  that  believes  in  the  equality  of  man  before  the  laws 
of  God,  and  in  the  equality  of  the  citizen  before  the  laws  of  man;  that 
it  is  the  Democratic  party  which  believes  in  the  right  of  the  governed 
to  govern ;  that  it  is  the  Democratic  party  which  believes  that  the 
will  of  the  majority  should  be  the  supreme  law  of  the  land,  and  yet 
believes  that  the  humblest  citizen  has  rights  which  are  more  sacred 
than  the  prerogatives  of  a  prince;  which  believes  that  the  lowliest  of 
the  lowly  has  certain  rights  of  which  no  majority  can  deprive  him  with- 
out tyranny  and  injustice.  [Applause.]  Let  them  learn  that  it  is  the 
Democratic  party  which  believes  in  the  rights  and  the  liberties  of  the 

citizen,  in  tlie  rights  ami  the  powers  of  the  States,  and  in  the  powers 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONTENTION  51 

and  limitations  of  the  Federal  Government.  Let  them  learn  that  it  is 
the  Democracy  which  believes  that  the  government  should  be  the 
fountain  of  justice  and  not  the  fountain  of  favors.  [Applause.]  Let 
them  learn  that  it  is  the  Democracy  which  believes  that  the  man 
who  eats  bread  in  the  sweat  of  his  own  face  is  as  royal  as  a  king 
[Applause.]  Let  them  learn  that  it  is  the  Democracy  which  believes 
in  the  coronation  of  the  common  man.  Let  Mr.  Boosevelt  learn — nay, 
he  has  already  learned — that  it  is  the  standpat  Republican  party  which 
believes  in  the  dethronement  of  the  people  and  the "  enthronement  of 
the  unburied  boss.  He  has  already  learned  that  the  Republican  party 
believes  in  the  divine  right  of  the  few  to  misgovern  the  many.  He 
has  already  learned  that  the  standpat  Republican  party  no  longer 
cherishes  the  faith  of  Lincoln  in  a  government  of  the  people,  by  the 
people,  for  the  people,  but  rather  believes  in  a  government  of  the 
privileged,  by  the  privileged,  for  the  privileged.  [Applause.] 

I  rejoice,  my  fellow  Democrats,  to  preach  the  gospel  of  Abraham 
Lincoln  here  in  this  hall,  consecrated  by  the  pictures  of  Andrew  Jack- 
son and  Thomas  Jefferson.  May  I  say  to  you  in  passing  that  I  believe 
the  home  and  the  tomb  of  Jefferson  should  be  owned  by  the  people, 
should  be  acquired  by  the  government,  should  be  converted  into  a 
shrine,  so  that  the  lovers  of  liberty  may  come  as  pilgrims  from  every 
dime  in  every  time  and  reconsecrate  their  devotion  to  the  rights  of  man 
and  renew  their  faith  in  the  capacity  of  the  people  to  govern  them- 
selves. [Applause.]  The  crusade  to  rescue  the  sepulchre  of  Jefferson 
and  to  place  it  in  the  hands  of  a  grateful  nation  has  already  begun, 
not  by  Richard  of  the  Lion  Heart,  but  by  a  devoted  little  Democratic 
woman,  Mrs.  Martin  W.  Littleton,  affectionately  known  as  Peggy,  and 
this  convention  should  endorse  and  approve  her  patriotic  endeavors  and 
her  unselfish  devotion.  [Applause.] 

My  friends.  Mr.  Roosevelt  has  already  learned  that  you  cannot  pour 
democratic  wine  into  republican  bottles.  [Applause.]  I  know  it  has 
been  said  that  a  standpat  republican,  like  a  French  Bourbon,  never 
learns  anything  and  never  forgets  anything.  That  is  not  true.  The 
standpat  Republicans  have  their  lesson  to  learn.  They  must  learn  that 
the  people  themselves  are  the  source  of  political  power  in  this  republic. 
They  must  learn  that  they  cannot  stay  the  flight  of  time  merely  by  stop 
ping  the  hands  upon  the  dial  of  the  clock.  They  must  learn  that  they 
cannot  keep  back  the  rising  furies  of  the  storm  merely  by  sitting  tight 
upon  the  barometer.  They  must  learn  that  the  spirit  of  progress  is  as 
constant  as  gravity  and  as  tireless  as  time,  and  that  it  presides  and 
must  preside  over  the  destinies  of  the  race  and  the  destinies  of  the 
republic.  [Applause.] 

The  people,  too,  have  their  lesson  to  learn.  They  must  learn  that 
they  can,  if  they  will,  hold"  in  their  own  hands  the  sceptre  of  power 
and  wear  upon  their  own  brow  the  crown  of  real  authority.  [Applause.] 

The  people  have  already  learned  that  they  cannot  rely  upon  th» 


52  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

republican  party  to  remedy  and  to  rectify  their  wrongs.  Let  the  people 
learn  that  under  a  republican  administration  the  laws  are  but  cobwebs 
to  catch  the  little  flies  and  let  the  big  ones  break  through  unharmed. 
The  people  have  learned  that  the  tariff  cannot  be  revised  by  its  friends, 
save  in  the  interest  of  its  friends.  They  have  learned  that  the  trusts 
cannot  be  dissolved  by  their  friends  save  in  the  interest  of  their  friends. 
The  people  have  learned  that  the  republican  party  believes  in  a  tariff 
policy  which  enables  one  man  to  get  without  earning  what  another  man 
earns  without  getting.  [Applause.]  The  people  have  learned  that  the 
man  who  made  two  blades  of  grass  grow  where  only  one  had  grown 
before  is  not  to  be  mentioned  in  the  same  breath  with  the  statesman 
who  made  sixteen  trusts  to  flourish  where  only  one  had  existed  before. 
[Applause.] 

The  people  have  learned  that  the  Eepublican  party  taxes  the  toys 
and  joys  of  childhood;  taxes  the  tools  in  the  hands  of  the  toiler;  taxes 
the  rags  upon  the  back  of  the  beggar;  taxes  the  crust  upon  the  lips  of 
hunger;  taxes  not  only  the  necessaries  and  comforts  of  life,  but  taxes 
the  cerements  and  the  monuments  of  the  dead.  [Applause.] 

Fellow  Democrats,  the  tariff  issue  has  been  eliminated  from  politics, 
for  I  myself  have  devised  a  solution  of  the  problem.  My  everlasting 
fame  shall  rest  upon  that  solution.  Under  my  system  every  article, 
either  produced  in  or  introduced  into  the  United  States,  shall  bear  a 
tag  and  on  that  tag  shall  be  inscribed  the  price  of  the  article,  plus  the 
tariff,  also  the  price  of  the  article  minus  the  tariff.  Under  this  plan 
everybody  who  believes  in  a  high  tariff  shall  be  allowed  to  buy  the 
articles  plus  the  tariff,  and  everybody  who  believes  in  a  low  tariff  or  in 
no  tariff  shall  be  allowed  to  buy  the  articles  at  the  price  less  the  tariff. 
[Laughter  and  applause.]  That  plan  is  bound  to  give  universal  satis- 
faction, because  under  its  operation  it  shall  be  done  unto  every  man 
according  to  his  faith.  [Applause  and  laughter.] 

My  fellow  Democrats,  the  battle  hymn  of  the  Democracy  in  this  con- 
test will  be,  "Let  the  people  rule."  Let  us  have  a  look  at  the  books, 
and  the  immediate  war-cry  shall  be,  "Less  tariff,  more  trade,  no  trusts, 
no  graft,  and  no  Taft. "  The  Eepublican  emblem  in  the  pending  con- 
test will  not  be  the  full  dinner-pail,  but  will  be — alas,  the  pity  of  it!  — 
the  empty  market  basket.  [Applause.] 

Under  this  Republican  regime,  under  their  revision  of  the  tariff,  the 
cost  of  living  has  gone  up  and  the  standard  of  living  has  gone  down. 
The  high  cost  of  living  sits  today  like  a  skeleton  at  every  banquet 
board,  at  every  breakfast  table.  It  haunts  not  only  the  closets,  but  it 
rifles  the  pantries  of  the  poor.  The  people  will  no  longer  kiss  the  jew- 
eled hand  that  smites  them.  They  have  already  been  smitten  upon  both 
cheeks.  , 

The  indications  now  are  that  before  this  Convention  concludes  some- 
body is  likely  to  be  defeated.  If  your  candidate  is  defeated  fell  this 
Btory  on  yourselves  when  you  return  to  your  several  homes.  Once  there 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  53 

was  a  small  boy  who  went  to  a  neighborhood  picnic,  and  he  met  with 
a  series  of  casualties  and  disasters.  He  fell  from  the  merry-go-round; 
he  lest  his  top;  he  was  stung  by  a  bumble-bee;  he  was  licked  by  a  new 
hoy  in  the  neighborhood.  Returning  home,  disfigured  and  disconsolate, 
his  mother,  after  viewing  the  prospects,  said,  "Jack,  how  did  you  enjoy 
the  day?"  He  said,  "I  am  so  glad  to  get  back  that  I  am  glad  I 
went."  [Laughter  and  applause.] 

My  fellow  Democrats,  what  is  a  mere  candidate  weighed  in  the  bal- 
ances with  a  mighty  cause!  What  is  a  mere  president  weighed  in  the 
balances  with  a  sacred  principle? 

If  the  Democracy  but  woo  victory  in  good  faith,  she  will  be  won  and 
wed.  The  march  of  events  is  with  us.  The  spirit  of  the  times  is  with 
us.  The  voice  of  the  people  and  the  voice  of  God  are  with  us.  [Ap- 
plause.] The  stars  in  their  course  wage  war  for  Democracy.  The  voice 
of  this  Convention  shall  be  my  voice.  Let  the  choice  of  this  Convention 
be  your  choice,  and  victory  will  be  assured.  [Applause.] 

SPEECH  OF  JOHN  TEMPLE  GRAVES. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  I  now  have  the  pleasure  of  introduc- 
ing to  you  one  of  Democracy's  foremost  orators,  Colonel  John  Temple 
Graves.  [Applause.] 

MR.  JOHN  TEMPLE  GRAVES:  Mr.  Chairman  and  Gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  in  the  five  minutes  which  I  shall  consume  I  shall  mention 
the  name  of  no  candidate  and  plead  the  shibboleth  of  no  faction. 

From  the  ranks  of  the  people  there  can  come  but  one  message  to  this 
triumphant  Convention  of  progressive  democracy — the  message  of  un- 
faltering courage  and  triumphant  hope.  Never  in  the  Democratic  his- 
tory of  the  last  fifty  years  has  there  assembled  a  convention  so  full  of 
hope,  so  full  of  promise,  so  full  of  splendid  courage  as  this  Convention 
of  today.  Our  last  faction  has  been  healed,  our  last  wrangle  has  been 
silenced,  and  he  who  henceforth  in  this  Convention  breathes  the  spirit  of 
discord  Or  the  spirit  of  division  is  a  traitor  to  the  future  and  recreant  to 
the  traditions  of  the  past. 

I  believe  we  have  never  confronted  any  condition  of  affairs  which 
has  promised  so  much  to  the  Democracy  and  to  the  people.  I  believe 
that  at  last  we  have  come  to  the  parting  of  the  ways.  The  Democratic 
party  in  the  last  ten  years  has  been  a  party  of  education.  Our  very 
wrangles  have  taught  us,  our  very  divisions  have  educated  us.  We  have 
grown  out  of  the  strife  and  faction  in  our  ranks  until  we  are  at  last  a 
welded  and  a  united  party.  Under  this  sign,  the  triumphant  sigu  of 
unity,  we  conquer.  I  believe  that  we  have  learned  many  things  from 
our  own  divisions,  and  that  we  are  the  beneficiaries  of  every  division 
among  our  enemies. 

God  and  the  people  are  on  the  side  of  the  triumphant  Democracy  of 
today.  God  and  the  people  are  pointing  us  the  way  toward  a  triumph- 


:&gt;l  OFFICIAL  "PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

anv  victory  in  November.  I  do  not  think  we  can  ever  hope  to  confront 
a  better  promise  than  that  which  is  ours  now. 

I  think  that  Theodore  Roosevelt  was  a  political  John  the  Baptist, 
crying  in  the  j  olitical  wilderness  in  Chicago.  "Prepare  ye.  prepare  ye 
the  way  of  Democracy;  make  her  paths  straight  at  Baltimore.''  I  be- 
lieve that  all  things  are  working  together  for  the  good  of  those  who  love 
the  Lord  and  follow  Thomas  Jefferson.  I  believe  we  now  have  but  one 
note  by  which  we  can  conquer — that  every  faction  in  our  party  must  be 
healed ;  that  all  those  who  fight  within  its  ranks  must  be  recognized. 
The  five-sevenths  of  progressive  democracy  absolutely  need  the  two- 
sevenths  of  conservatism  to  make  our  calling  and  election  sure.  We 
cannot  win  without  them.  The  Democracy  can  hope  no  more  than  to 
hold  its  own.  If  the  Democracy  can  hold  its  own,  its  triumph  is  abso- 
lutely assured.  Taft  and  the  reactionaries  will  lead  those  who  worship 
the  golden  idol  of  privilege;  Eoosevelt  recognizes  the  spirit  of  discon- 
tent that  divides  the  Republican  party;  and  if  we  can  only  hold  our 
own,  if  we  can  only  gather  to  ourselves  that  which  is  ours,  if  we  «.-an 
only  hold  the  men  who  belong  to  the  Democracy  of  the  past  and  the 
Democracy  of  the  future,  we  can  surely  and  triumphantly  win. 

I  know  that  the  time  has  come  at  last  when  every  great  name  who 
has  pleaded  the  cause  of  Democracy  shall  be  recognized  as  indispensable 
to  its  success.  I  believe  the  time  has  come  when  we  shall  mingle  Ohio 
and  New  Jersey,  when  Massachusetts  and  South  Carolina  shall  be  joined 
together  above  the  grave  of  Republicanism.  I  believe  the  time  has 
come  when  the  superb  and  stirring  eloquence  of  Bryan  shall  be  joined 
with  the  magnificent  advocacy  of  Hearst.  I  believe  the  time  has  come 
when  Alfalfa  Bill  of  Oklahoma  shall  clasp  hands  with  George  Fred 
Williams  of  Massachusetts,  when  the  old  lion  of  five-sevenths  of  progress 
shall  lie  down  with  the  little  lamb  of  two-sevenths  of  conservatism,  and 
the  triumphant  spirit  of  Thomas  Jefferson  shall  lead  them  past  faction 
into  the  pleasant  paths  of  perpetual  and  eternal  peace.  [Applause.] 

The  Democratic  party  cannot  die.  Parties  may  live;  other  parties 
have  lived;  the  old  Whig  party,  the  old  Federal  party,  the -Populist 
party,  the  independent  parties,  with  scholastic  legions;  but  when  they 
are  all  gone,  the  Democratic  party  shall  live,  and  live  forever,  when  the 
Republican  party,  wrapping  the  mantle  of  its  splendid  sins  about  it, 
shall  fall  by  the  pillars  of  the  Constitution  that  it  has  stained  forever 
with  its  dishonored  history.  [Applause.] 

SPEECH  OF  JAMES  H.  PRESTOX. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  A  word  of  welcome  is  next  in  order 
from  Mayor  Preston  of  Baltimore.  [Applause.] 

MR.  .IAMKS  H.  PRESTOX,  of  Baltimore:  Ladies  and  gentlemen.  I 
shall  trespass  on  your  patience  but  three  minutes,  in  order  to  conv.-v  T.I 
you  the  welcome  of  the  people  of  Baltimore  and  of  Maryland  to  the 
avalaiu-h.-  of  the  democracy.  [Applause.]  We  have  met  you  and  ve 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  55 

love  YOU.  We  greet  you  in  our  city.  We  hope  that  your  stay  has  been 
r.rnl  will  continue  to  be  pleasant,  and  that  you  will  take  away  from  Bal- 
timore memories  of  this  Convention  which  will  live  in  your  hearts  for- 
ever. [Applause.] 

After  having,  on  behalf  of  our  people  and  our  city,  extended  to  you 
this  welcome,  may  I  now  say  a  word  that  is  close  to  my  heart,  and  1 
believe  to  yours,  concerning  the  great  political  future  which  the  Demo- 
cratic party  has  in  store  for  it. 

A  Democratic  Convention  is  a  great  crucible  into  which  are  brought 
ideas  from  the  East  and  West,  from  the  North  and  South,  and  those 
ideas  and  principles,  so  brought  here,  are  in  this  great  crucible  fused 
into  a  platform.  Upon  that  platform  is  selected  some  one  man  to  meet 
your  views  who  shall  represent  the  democracy  in  the  coming  battle. 

One  thing,  my  friends,  is  most  important,  is  close  to  your  hearts  and 
to  mine,  and  that  is  that  we  should  go  into  this  great  battle  with  no 
divided  front,  that  the  great  principles  upon  which  we  have  now  to  make 
our  fight  shall  be  presented  by  a  united  democracy,  and  that  every  man 
before  nit,  whether  he  is  sitting  in  these  galleries  as  a  listener  or  is  rep- 
resenting his  constituents  under  this  great  flotilla  of  standards,  shal] 
not  only  add  his  voice  to  the  enunciation  of  principles,  in  praise  of  the 
candidate  here,  but  that  he  shall  raise  his  voice  for  a  harmonious  and 
united  democracy  today,  and  during  the  rest  of  the  campaign.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

My  friends,  I  welcome  you,  and  am  delighted  to  see  you  in  Baltimore-. 
On  behalf  of  our  people  and  our  municipality  I  bid  you  welcome. 
|  Applause.] 

SPEECH  OF  JAMES  E.  CAMPBELL. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  now  has  the  pleasure  of 
introducing  to  you  ex-Governor  Campbell  of  Ohio.  [Applause.] 

MR.  JAMES  E.  CAMPBELL,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen,' 
in  the  last  three  State  elections  we  have  carried  Ohio  for  the  Democratic 
ticket,  and  so  I  am  proud  to  come  to  you  from  a  Democratic  State. 
[Applause.]  Ohio,  which  has  given  six  Eepublican  Presidents  to  the 
nation,  is  sitting  now  side  by  side  with  Texas,  as  she  will  march  in  the 
Democratic  column  shoulder  to  shoulder  with  Texas.  [Applause.] 

I  had  intended  to  confine  my  speech  to  a  motion  to  adjourn,  knowing 
how  popular  that  would  be,  but  there  are  other  speakers,  and  therefore 
I  will  call  attention  to  one  historical  incident  in  this  country  which 
some  of  you  have  perhaps  forgotten.  History  repeats  itself,  and  it  is 
repeating  itself  at  this  moment  in  this  country. 

In  1860  the  Democratic  party  had  been  governing  this  country  for 
sixty  long  and  prosperous  years,  and,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  it 
had  a  majority  of  more  than  a  million  in  the  popular  vote,  and  a 
majority  in  two-thirds  of  the  States,  it  split,  lost  the  election  that  year, 
and  went  out  of  power.  Now  where  are  we?  The  party  which  since 
that  time  has  almost  continuously  governed  this  country  has  split,  Sena- 


5G  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

tor  Gore  said,  into  two  halves,  one  dead  and  one  alive.  My  criticism  of 
his  speech  is  that  he  said  either  one  was  alive.  They  are  both  dead,  but 
one  is  deader  than  the  other.  [Laughter.]  The  Taft  wing  is  a  disor- 
ganized rabble  composed  of  cainp  followers,  sutlers,  bounty  jumpers, 
coffee  coolers  and  the  refuse  of  what  was  once  the  Republican  party. 
[Applause.]  The  other  wing  is  led  by  a  self-sufficient  egotist  whose 
sanity  and  probity  have  both  been  questioned;  a  man  who  went  to  St. 
Louis  and  opened  the  great  Louisiana  Purchase  Exposition,  but  never 
mentioned  the  name  of  Thomas  Jefferson;  a  man  who  dedicated  a  monu- 
ment on  the  field  of  Antietam,  but  never  thought  to  mention  George  B. 
McClellan;  the  only  President  who  has  had  the  audacity  to  go  to  Gettys- 
burg and  make  a  speech  on  the  spot  where  Abraham  Lincoln  -made  his 
immortal  address. 

Now  the  lesson  is  easy.  Let  them  go  to  their  destruction  if  they  will. 
Let  us  take  advantage  of  it  as  we  must,  and  the  Democratic  party  will 
come  into  sixty  more  years  of  continuous  occupation  and  good  govern- 
ment. [Applause.] 

ADJOURNMENT. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  recognizes  Mr.  Robinson,  of 
Arkansas. 

MR.  JOE  T.  ROBINSON,  of  Arkansas:  Mr.  Chairman,  inasmuch  as 
none  of  the  committees  will  be  ready  to  report  before  that  time.  I  move 
that  the  Convention  adjourn  until  2  o'clock  tomorrow  afternoon. 

ME.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMEU,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  make 
the  point  of  order  that  the  Convention  has  already  passed  a  resolution 
that  when  it  takes  a  recess  today  it  be  until  8  o'clock  this  evening. 
Therefore  nothing  but  a  motion  to  take  a  recess  until  that  time  is  in 
order. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:     The  point  of  order  is  well  taken. 

MR.  ROBINSON,  of  Arkansas:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  reso- 
lution by  which  the  Convention  agreed  that  when  the  Convention  take  a 
recess  it  be  until  8  o'clock  this  evening  be  rescinded,  and  that  w&lt;? 
adjourn  until  2  o'clock  tomorrow. 

MR.  PALMER:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  make  the  same  point  of  order. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  point  of  order  is  well  taken.  As 
the  Chair  understands  it,  the  motion  is  not  simply  to  rescind,  but  a  mo- 
tion to  rescind  coupled  with  a  motion  to  fix  the  hour  to  which  the  Con- 
vention shall  adjourn. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  I  move  that  the  Convention  now 
take  a  recess  until  8  o'clock  this  evening. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to;  and  (at  2  o'clock  and  17  minutes  p.  m.  - 
rli-'  Convention  took  a  recess  until  8  o'clock  p.  m. 

EVENING   SESSION. 

At  the  expiration  of  the  recess  the  Convention  reassembled.

DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  57 

by  Reverend  T.  O.  Grouse,  D.   D.,  pasfor  of  the  Mount  Royal  Avenue 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  Baltimore,  Md. 

PRAYER  OF  REVEREND  T.  O.  C ROUSE,  D.  D. 

Reverend  T.  O.  Grouse,  D.  D.,  pastor  of  the  Mount  Royal  Avenue 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  Baltimore,  offered  the  following  prayer: 

Almighty  and  Eternal  God,  King  of  kings  and  Lord  of  lords,  Who 
dost  from  Thy  heavenly  Throne  behold  and  govein  all  the  peoples  and 
nations  of  this  earth;  with  humble  adoration  and  grateful  thanksgiving 
we  present  ourselves  before  Thy  throne  of  grace.  Mercifully  regard  us 
and  inspire  and  cleanse  our  thoughts  by  the  inspiration  of  Thy  Holy 
Spirit.  We  at  this  time  especially  adore  Thee  as  the  God  in  whom  our 
fathers  trusted;  as  the  God  whose  holy  and  protecting  arm  hast  pre- 
served and  guided  the  people  of  this  Republic  through  many  and  great 
perils;  hast  distinguished  them  by  unnumbered  blessings  and  given  them 
a  great  name  among  the  nations  of  the  earth. 

Grant  to  continue  to  our  country  Thy  holy  care  and  merciful  protec- 
tion; be  Thou  our  Shield  and  Buckler,  and  so  direct  and  overrule  all 
the  deliberations  and  counsels  of  this  great  Convention  that  the  cause  of 
human  rights  and  happiness  may  be  furthered,  and  the  kingdom  of 
truth,  equity  and  righteousness  may  be  established.  May  these  Thy 
servants  be  preserved  from  selfishness,  discord  and  unseemly  contention. 
May  they  be  animated  by  true  patriotism  and  serve  Thee  by  best  serving 
the  millions  of  people  whom  they  represent.  Give  clear  vision,  lofty 
purpose  and  steadfast  courage  to  each  delegate  here  assembled,  and 
when  the  decisions  of  this  Convention  are  reached,  may  we  all  have  rea- 
son to  rejoice  in  Thy  favor  and  guiding  providence.  Thou  Fountain  of 
all  wisdom,  Who  knowest  our  necessities  even  before  we  ask,  and  our 
ignorance  in  asking,  we  beseech  Thee  to  have  compassion  upon  our  in- 
firmities, and  answer  us  not  according  to  our  merit  or  the  worthiness  of 
our  petition,  but  according  to  the  fulness  of  Thy  wisdom  and  grace, 
"through  Jesus  Christ  our  Saviour  and  Lord.  Amen.

"J.  HARRY  COVIXGTOX,  Chairman." 

Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  due  the  Convention  that  a  very  brief  explanation 
be  made  with  regard  to  the  change  of  the  order  of  business,  as  it  has 
previously  been  adopted  in  National  Conventions  save  in  the  Conven- 
tion of  1908. 

The  ordinary  order  of  business  in  Democratic  Conventions,  after 
the  report  of  the  Committee  on  Permanent  Organization  has  been  pre- 
sented and  adopted  by  the  Convention,  has  been  to  receive  the  report 
of  the  Committee  on  Besolutions.  In  other  words,  there  is  presented 
to  the  Convention  for  its  discussion  and  adoption  the  platform  upon 
which  the  party  purposes  to  make  its  campaign  for  the  suffrages  of 
the  American  people.  But  when  the  Committee  on  Bules  was  deliberat- 
ing today  there  was  a  visit  to  its  room  by  a  subcommittee  of  three 
distinguished  Democrats  from  the  Committee  on  Besolutions. 

Senator  Bayner  of  Maryland,  Senator  Vardaman  of  Mississippi  and 
one  other  distinguished  member  of  that  committee  appeared  before  our 
committee  with  the  statement  that  the  great  Committee  on  Besolutions 
had,  by  a  vote  of  41  to  11,  and  with  practically  unanimity  of  discussion, 
determined  that  the  exigencies  of  the  Democracy  at  this  hour  require 
that  its  candidate  be  nominated  before  the  platform  is  selected  upon 
which  he  is  to  make  his  fight.  [Applause.] 

The  Committee  on  Bules  did  not  believe  the  question  involved  was 
a  fundamental  one.  There  was  some  difference  of  opinion  whether  or 
not  the  great  principles  of  Democracy  are  not,  after  all,  greater  than 
any  candidacy;  but  recognizing  that  it  was  to  some  extent  a  minor 
matter,  and  recognizing  the  judgment  of  the  distinguished  gentlemen 
serving  upon  the  Committee  on  Besolutions,  the  Committee  on  Bules 
determined  to  report,  in  consonance  with  that  suggestion,  the  change 
in  the  order  of  business  which  is  incorporated  in  this  report. 

Therefore,  Mr.  Cliairman,  I  move  the  adoption  of  this  report  by  the 
Convention. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the 
report  of  the  Committee  on  Bules  and  Order  of  Business,  as  presented 
liy  the  gentleman  from  Maryland  (Mr.  Covingon). 

The  report  was  agreed  to. 

MR.  J.  HARRY  COVINGTOX,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Com- 
mittee on  Bules  and  Order  of  Business  present  to  this  Convention  an 
additional  report  for  its  adoption,  as  follows: 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  59 

' '  Et  shall  be  the  rule  of  this  Convention  that  all  State  delegations 
which  have  been  instructed  by  their  respective  State  Democratic  con- 
ventions, or  by  a  State  Democratic  Presidential  preference  primary, 
shall  follow  those  instructions,  so  long  as  a  majority  of  the  delegates 
from  such  State  are  of  the  opinion  that  such  instructions  are  applicable. 

"J.   HARRY  COVINGTOX,   Chairman." 

Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  recognized  that  this  is  a  crucial  resolution. 
There  will  be  presented  from  the  Committee  on  Rules  a  minority  report. 
That  report  is  signed  by  fifteen  of  the  members  of  that  committee. 
The  distinguished  gentleman  from  Texas,  Representative  Henry,  will 
present  the  minority  report. 

In  order  to  preserve  the  parliamentary  situation,  it  has  been  agreed 
by  Representative  Henry  and  myself  that  the  debate  upon  this  resolu- 
tion shall  proceed  for  two  hours.  One  hour  of  that  time  will  be  con- 
trolled by  the  chairman  of  the  committee,  myself,  and  one  hour  will  be 
controlled  by  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  Henry).  ["No,  no! 
Twenty  minutes ! ' '] 

Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  if  there  is  one  thing  that  is  all 
important  in  a  Democratic  Convention,  it  is  that  great  questions  sTiall 
not  be  determined  upon  the  spur  of  the  moment.  For  that  reason  the 
gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  Henry)  and  myself  have  agreed  that  this 
crucial  proposition  shall  be  amply  debated.  It  has  been  agreed  that  at 
the  end  of  the  debate  the  previous  question  shall  not  be  considered  as 
ordered.  The  parliamentary  situation  then  will  be  that  at  the  end  of 
that  time  amendments  to  the  resolution  will  be  in  order,  thus  preserving 
in  its  full  amplitude  the  right  of  every  delegate  to  move  such  changes 
as  in  his  wisdom  he  deems  proper  or  desirable. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  now 
present  Congressman  Henry,  of  Texas,  who  will  present  the  minority 
report. 

Ah;.  ROBERT  L.  HENRY,  of  Texas:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  if  you  will  permit  me  in  a  few  brief  moments  I  will 
present  the  other  side  of  this  important  question.  Tonight  the  Demo- 
crats here  must  strike  no  blow  at  local  self-government  and  the  right 
of  the  people  to  rule  in  their  primaries.  [Applause.] 

"We  concur  in  the  report  of  the  committee,  except  in  regard  to  the 
resolution  providing  a  rule  touching  the  unit  rule,  and  we  submit  the 
following  resolution  as  a  substitute  therefor,  and  recommend  its 
adoption: 

Resolved,  That  in  casting  votes  on  a  call  of  the  States,  the  Chair 
shall  recognize  and  enforce  a  unit  rule  enacted  by  a  State  convention, 
except  in  such  States  as  have  by  mandatory  statute  provided  for  the 
nomination  and  election  of  delegates  and  alternates  to  national  political 
conventions  in  Congressional  districts,  and  have  not  subjected  delegates

party,  in  which  case  no  such  rule  shall  be  held  to  apply.

Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  after  the  chairman  of  the  Committee 
on  Rules  and  Order  of  Business  has  presented  his  side  of  this  con- 
troversy, I  shall  ask  the  indulgence  of  the  delegates  in  order  that  I 
may  present  the  other  side  of  this  important  proposition  in  behalf  of 
the  people  in  every  locality  and  district  throughout  this  country. 
[Applause.] 

MR.  J.  HARRY  COVINGTON,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  the 
majority  of  the  Committee  on  Rules  did  not  believe  that  the  question  of 
the  application  of  the  unit  rule  to  delegations  in  a  Democratic  Con- 
vention involved  a  fundamental  question  of  Democratic  principles,  but 
the  majority  of  that  committee  did  believe  that  there  is  a  time- 
honored  and  historic  Democratic  position  upon  the  unit  rule. 

It  will  be  observed  that  this  resolution  does  not  require  a  delegation 
to  vote  under  the  unit  rule  unless  it  has  received  explicit  instructions 
from  the  people  of  the  State,  either  through  a  State  convention  or  a 
preferential  primary  in  that  State. 

Since  1852  the  Democracy,  adhering  to  its  belief  that  the  preserva- 
tion of  the  integrity  of  State  lines  was  in  accord  with  Democratic  prin- 
ciples, has  adhered  to  the  right  to  recognize  the  unit  rule  in  its 
National  Conventions.  The  Democratic  party  has  always  been  a  party 
which  recognizes  the  States  as  units.  It  has  been  preeminently,  from 
the  time  of  its  birth  under  Jefferson,  the  party  of  the  conservation  of 
the  States.  It  has  recognized  that  in  the  Constitution  itself  it  found 
the  predominant  unit  of  the  States.  If  an  election  shall  perchance  be 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  61 

thrown  «uto  the  House  of  Representatives,  the  great  founders  of  this 
Republic  were  sedulous  to  preserve  the  rights  of  the  States  by  decree- 
ing that  the  vote  of  each  State  should  be  cast  as  a  unit  in  accordance 
with  the  will  of  a  majority  of  its  Representatives  in  the  House  of 
Representatives.  [Applause.]  The  Democratic  party  long  before  the 
civil  war  established  the  two-thirds  rule  in  National  Conventions.  The 
two-thirds  rule  and  the  unit  rule,  where  enforced  by  the  people  of  a 
State,  go  hand  in  hand.  When  you  obliterate  the  lines  of  the  States, 
when  you  seek  to  destroy  that  fundamental  demarcation,  there  is  then 
no  logical  reason  to  preserve  the  two-thirds  rule  in  a  Democratic  Con- 
vention; but  the  wisdom  of  the  fathers  determined  that  two-thirds  of 
air  the  delegates  in  convention  assembled  should  be  necessary  to  select 
a  candidate  for  the  presidency  by  this  great  party,  because  it  recog- 
nized the  right  of  the  States  as  units;  and  realizing  the  preponderance 
of  influence  held  by  the  great  States  in  convention  assembled,  it  pre- 
served the  rights  of  the  smaller  States  by  establishing  the  two-thirds 
rule;  and  who  is  there  in  this  Convention  who  shall  say  that  that 
primal  recognition  of  the  rights  of  the  States  is  not  Jeffersonian 
doctrine?  [Applause.] 

Mr.  Chairman,  in  addition  to  that,  the  very  spirit  of  the  unit  rule 
is  the  spirit  that  goes  with  the  progressivism  of  today.  We  have  had, 
from  Maine  to  California,  from  the  Canadian  boundary  to  the  Rio 
Grande,  a  demand  for  preferential  primaries,  and  the  direct  popular 
election  of  all  sorts  of  candidates  and  delegates.  That  is  the  recog- 
nition by  the  Democracy  of  the  right  of  the  people  of  the  State  as 
a  whole  to  give  instructions  to  its  delegates  in  convention  assembled. 
When  a  great  State  shall  place  upon  its  statute  books  a  law  requiring 
a  vote  by  the  people  of  the  State,  or  when  it  requires  that  the  delegates 
to  the  State  convention  shall  be  elected  by  direct  vote,  it  is  the  logic 
of  that  position  that  it  was  the  determination  of  a  Democracy,  sedulous 
to  preserve  the  rights  of  the  people,  that  the  States  should  speak  as 
units.  So  instead  of  the  enforcement  of  a  unit  at  the  behest  of  a 
State  being  against  Democratic  doctrine,  it  is  in  line  with  the  spirit 
of  progressivism  that  is  taking  entire  and  rightful  possession  of  a 
unified  Democracy. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  simply  want  to  say  in  conclusion  that  it  is  not, 
I  repeat,  a  fundamental  question.  One  of  the  great  Democratic  lead- 
ers of  the  past,  gone  to  his  grave,  stated  that  the  greatest  creed  of 
Democracy  was  "in  essentials,  unity;  in  non-essentials,  liberty;  in  all 
things,  charity."  We  in  this  Convention,  and  the  majority  of  the 
Committee  on  Rules,  believe  that  those  States  enjoying  the  liberty  of 
Democracy,  that  have  determined  to  send  their  delegates  here  each  as 
an  individual,  shall  vote  as  individuals.  While  recognizing  the  right  of' 
the  State  rights  Democracy  to  do  as  it  wills  within  a  State,  we  have 
believed  that  it  is  the  liberty  of  Democracy  to  permit  a  State  to 
instruct  its  delegation  to  vote  as  a  whole,  and  at  the  conclusion  of 


62  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

this  debate  I  shall  move  the  adoption  of  the  majority   report.      [Ap- 
plause.] 

MR.  EGBERT  L.  HENRY,  of  Texas:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  it  is  a  surprise  to  me  that  the  gentleman  from  Mary- 
land (Mr.  Covington)  should  be  found  presenting  a  report  which 
denies  the  right  of  the  people  of  a  district  to  select  and  instruct  their 
delegates,  in  view  of  the  fact  that  his  State  has  a  law  to  the  con- 
trary. [Applause.] 
'  MR.  COVINGTON,  of  Maryland:  Oh,  no. 

MR.  HENRY,  of  Texas:  There  is  no  effort  here  to  subvert  the  time- 
honored  unit  rule  as  it  has  obtained  for  nearly  a  hundred  years.  We 
recognize  the  right  of  State  conventions  to  elect  delegates  and  instruct 
those  delegates  when  there  is  no  State  law  controlling  in  such  matters. 
Permit  me  to  illustrate  by  reference  to  the  State  of  Texas,  the  State 
which  I  have  the  honor  in  part  to  represent  on  the  floor  of  this  Con- 
vention. We  have  no  primary  election  law  there  for  the  purpose  of 
selecting  delegates  to  a  National  Convention,  but  have  the  old  system 
of  the  State  Executive  Committee  calling  precinct  conventions  and 
county  conventions,  and  a  State  convention,  to  select  delegates  from 
amongst  their  own  representation  to  the  National  Convention. 

How  different  is  the  case  we  have  before  us  here  tonight.  In  the 
State  of  Ohio  we  have  a  proposition  of  this  sort:  The  legislature  of  the 
State  of  Ohio  withdrew  entirely  from  the  domain  of  the  jurisdiction 
of  political  parties  the  right  to  select  delegates  at  x  large  to  the 
National  Convention,  but  wrote  into  the  State  statutes  a  provision  that 
the  people  in  every  Congressional  district  should  have  the  right  to  elect 
delegates  by  a  direct  vote  of  the  people.  [Applause.]  Permit  me  to 
call  your  attention  to  a  statute  of  a  sovereign  State,  in  order  to 
determine  this  most  important  question  in  accordance  with  the  rules 
of  justice  and  fair  interpretation.  To  my  mind  it  is  so  plain  that 
the  reading  of  the  statute  of  Ohio  should  settle  the  question.  This 
statute,  which  was  passed  in  1910,  and  is  embodied  in  section  4966  of 
the  Eevised  Statutes  of  the  State  of  Ohio,  reads  as  follows: 

"Candidates  for  Congress  shall  be  nominated  by  direct  vote  of  the 
people,  and  delegates  and  alternates  to  national  political  conventions 
shall  be  elected  by  direct  vote  of  the  people  at  the  same  time,  and  in 
the  manner  following. ' ' 

Then  the  statute  provides  how  these  delegates  may  be  elected,  and 
requires  a  petition  therefor,  signed  by  electors  of  the  district  who  are 
members  of  the  political  party  where  such  candidate  resides,  not  less 
in  number  than  two  per  cent  of  the  votes  cast  in  said  district  for  the 
candidate  for  governor  of  such  party  at  the  last  election. 

Then  it  prescribes  the  manner  of  certification,  to  wit: 

"Such  deputy  supervisor  shall  certify  the  result  to  such  district 
officers  under  the  general  election  laws. ' ' 

There  is  the  plain  statute  of  the  State  of  Ohio.     Permit  me  to  read 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  63 

to  you  the  votes  in  some  of  these  Ohio  districts,  where  the  people, 
under  the  explicit  law,  elected  their  delegates  as  they  thought  best. 

In  the  Twentieth  District  the  delegates  favoring  one  gentleman 
(Harmon)  received  1,948  votes,  and  the  delegates  who  were  friendly  to 
the  other  (Wilson)  received  4,255  votes. 

In  the  Twenty-first  District  the  delegates  for  one  candidate  (Har- 
mon) received  2,857  votes  and  the  delegates  friendly  to  the  other  candi- 
date (Wilson)  received  6,389  votes.  So  the  State  executive  committee 
issued  a  proclamation  in  pursuance  of  the  order  that  was  issued  by  the 
national  executive  committee,  and  ordered  a  primary  election  for  the 
selection  of  delegates  at  large,  but  acquiesced  in  the  law  that  had  been 
passed  by  the  State  of  Ohio  and  signed  by  her  Democratic  governor, 
and  left  it  with  the  districts  to  determine  when  and  how  they  should 
select  those  delegates  under  that  State  law. 

We  have  a  case  here  which  is  in  no  wise  similar  to  the  application  of 
the  unit  rule  in  the  State  of  Texas,  and  those  States  holding  primaries 
and  conventions,  where  there  is  no  law  authorizing  the  people  to  select 
delegates  by  direct  vote. 

What  does  this  mean?  It  signifies  that  the  State  has  carried  out 
the  public  policy  as  demanded  by  the  people,  has  written  a  statute,  and 
accorded  to  the  voters  in  every  Congressional  district  in  such  State  the 
right  to  elect  their  own  delegates.  Then,  although  the  statute  has  been 
complied  with,  gentlemen  go  into  a  State  convention  in  Ohio,  and  there 
the  delegates  assembled,  not  content  with  ratifying  what  has  been  done 
in  reference  to  delegates  at  large,  whose  selection  it  was  provided  should 
be  made  by  the  candidate  receiving  the  highest  number  of  votes  in  the 
State  for  President,  but  take  an  arbitrary  course  in  reference  to  the 
district  delegates.  After  the  delegates  have  been  elected,  and  in  some 
districts  where  delegates  on  both  sides  have  agreed  to  abide  by  the 
decision  of  the  sovereign  voice  of  the  voters  in  such  districts,  and  where 
they  were  acquiescing  in  that  decision,  the  State  convention  proceeds  to 
repudiate  and  nullify  the  State  statute  and  to  spit  upon  the  will  of  the 
people  who  have  proceeded  under  the  law. 

Gentlemen,  you  have  the  case  as  I  understand  it  after  a  patient  hear- 
ing in  the  Committee  on  Rules  and  Order  of  Business,  and  in  my  humble 
judgment  if  this  Convention  here  tonight  reverses  the  will  of  the  ponph&gt; 
in  those  districts  in  Ohio  which  selected  their  delegates  and  instructed 
them  under  solemn  provision  of  law,  it  will  be  equivalent  to  the  National 
Convention  repudiating  and  nullifying  the  voice  of  a  sovereign  State  of 
the  Union.  [Applause.] 

If  Democracy  stands  for  anything,  it  stands  for  State  rights  and 
local  self-government,  and  the  privilege  of  the  people  to  rule  in  their 
own  affairs,  in  accordance  with  the  teachings  of  Thomas  Jefferson, 
[Applause.] 

Let  this  Convention  make  no  mistake  to  gratify  the  ambitions  or  whims 
of  any  man.  If  we  are  true  to  the  traditions  and  history  and  principles  of 


64  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

the  Democratic  party  and  make  no  blunder  here,  when  the  votes  are 
counted  next  November  our  victory  will  reach  from  ocean  to  own. 
[Applause.]  Therefore  I  say  we  should  not  set  aside  the  will  of -the 
voters  in  those  districts  where  they  have  expressed  their  choice,  under 
solemn  statutory  enactment,  but  ratify  them  here  tonight,  and  announce 
to  the  people  in  every  district  and  State,  cur  wish  that  they  ' '  Go  for- 
ward with  presidential  preferential  primaries,  and  everything  that  gives 
the  people  a  right  to  participate  in  the  affairs  of  Government,  and  write 
such  laws  upon  the  statute  books  of  every  State  in  the  Union."  [Ap- 
plause.] 

Let  us  tonight  decree  the  death  of  the  political  bosses  and  convention 
tricksters  and  welcome  the  uprising  and  rule  of  the  people. 

MR.  J.  HARRY  COVIXGTOX,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield 
twenty  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr.  Peck). 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr.  Peck) 
has  the  floor  for  twenty  minutes. 

MR.  JOHN  WELLS  PECK,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  I  come  here  tonight  to  bespeak,  on  behalf  of  the  State 
of  Ohio,  that  right  to  integrity  of  action  and  unity  of  purpose  that 
Democratic  conventions  have  accorded  to  the  sovereign  States  for  the 
past  sixty  years.  [Applause.]  For  nearly  three-quarters  of  a  century 
it  has  been  the  law  of  the  Democratic  party  that  when  a  Democratic 
State  convention  has  expressed  an  instruction  to  a  delegation  to  thr 
National  Convention,  that  instruction  should  be  recognized  and  carried 
out.  [Applause.] 

Now,  gentlemen,  the  resolution  presented  in  this  minority  report  is 
artfully  drawn.  It  is  apparently  general  in  its  scope,  affecting  all  dele- 
gations; but  as  a  matter  of  fact  it  affects  only  the  delegation  from  the 
State  of  Ohio.  It  is  now  proposed  to  take  from  the  State  of  Ohio  the 
right  to  have  the  power  of  unified  action  which  has  always  been  recog- 
nized and  accorded.  ["No,  no."]  Gentlemen,  I  trust  you  will  bear 
with  me  until  you  get  the  facts  regarding  the  State  of  Ohio.  All  we 
ask  is  a  hearing  of  our  case,  and  after  you  have  heard  it  fairly  stated, 
if  you  do  not  agree  with  me  I  will  have  no  quarrel.  But  in  the  last 
three  elections  the  Democrats  have  carried  the  State  of  Ohio — the  last 
time  by  100,000  majority — and  we  are  entitled  to  be  heard  in  a  National 
Convention.  [Applause.] 

In  Ohio  those  papers  which  advocated  the  nomination  for  the  presi- 
dency of  the  great  governor  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey  demanded  a 
State  wide  presidential  preference  primary.  [Applause.]  Although  the 
law  did  not  require  such  a  primary  to  be  held,  it  was  nevertheless  hell 
at  the  time  the  general  primary  election  was  held,  and  by  the  same 
officers  and  at  the  same  places,  and  the  vote  was  canvassed  in  the  same 
way.  When  the  vote  of  the  State  of  Ohio  at  this  State  wide  preference 
primary  had  been  canvassed,  it  was  found  that  the  governor  of  Ohio  had 
a  majority  of  over  10,000  of  the  voters.  [Applause.]  At  the  same  pri- 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  65 

mary  950  delegates  to  the  State  convention  were  elected  by  the  people. 
When  the  governor  of  Ohio  had  received  this  vote  in  the  State-wide 
preference  primary,  we  thought  that  the  result  so  far  as  Ohio  was  con- 
cerned was  final.  Had  the  other  candidate  prevailed  at  that  primary 
we  would  have  acquiesced  in  his  claim  to  the  votes  of  the  State  delega 
tion  from  Ohio  in  this  Convention.  [Applause.]  We  thought  we  were 
playing  marbles  for  keeps,  but  they  told  us  we  were  only  playing  marbles 
for  fun. 

That  State  convention  assembled  at  Toledo,  the  delegates  to  which 
were  elected  by  the  Democracy  of  Ohio,  instructed  the  delegates  from 
the  State  of  Ohio  to  this  Convention,  by  a  vote  of  600  to  350,  to  cast 
the  vote  of  Ohio  as  a  unit  for  the  governor  of  Ohio,  so  long  as  his  name 
should  be  before  this  body,  or  until  a  majority  of  the  delegates  from 
Ohio  decided  otherwise.  [Applause.]  In  some  districts  in  the  State  of 
Ohio  candidates  were  elected  who  avowed  themselves  to  be  in  favor  of 
another  candidate  for  President,  but  in  six  of  those  districts  the  gov- 
ernor of  Ohio  carried  the  presidential  preference  primary.  Yet  it  is 
the  avowed  intention  of  those  delegates,  if  you  release  them  from  their 
instructions  from  the  Democracy  of  Ohio,  to  disregard  the  will  of  the 
people  in  their  districts.  So  they  do  not  want  this  unit  rule  taken  off 
for  the  purpose  of  following  the  will  of  the  voters  of  their  districts,  but 
they  want  it  taken  off  for  the  purpose  of  voting  as  they  please.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

Before  our  Committee  on  Rules  and  Order  of  Business  the  parlia- 
mentarian of  this  Convention,  Judge  Crisp,  of  Georgia,  said  that  he  had 
studied  the  history  of  the  Democratic  party  and  that  that  study  revealed 
that  the  Democratic  National  Convention  was  a  convention  of  States  and 
not  of  Congressional  districts.  [Applause.]  He  further  said  that  he 
had  examined  the  law  of  Ohio,  and  that  he  had  found  nothing  in  that 
law  to  alter  that  conclusion.  That  law  governs  the  method  of  selection, 
but  the  delegates  come  here  representing  the  Democracy  of  the  State  of 
Ohio.  It  is  not  our  will  to  nullify  the  desires  of  the  Democracy  of  our 
State,  but  we  say  that  our  State  must  be  accepted  as  a  unit;  that  its 
desires,  expressed  at  its  presidential  preference  primary,  twined  into  an 
instruction  at  the  State  convention,  expresses  the  will  of  the  people  of 
Ohio,  and  we  ask  you  here  to  let  the  delegates  from  Ohio  echo  that  grand 
chorus  in  favor  of  our  candidate.  [Applause.] 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  Congressman  Henry  now  yields  fifteen 
minutes  of  his  time  to  Hon.  Newton  D.  Baker,  mayor  of  Cleveland.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

MR.  NEWTON  D.  BAKER,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  I  do  not  come  here  to  attack  the  unit  rule  established 
by  the  repeated  tradition  of  National  Democratic  Conventions,  but  I 
come  to  vindicate  the  sovereignty  of  the  State  of  Ohio  and  to  proclaim 
the  sanctity  of  her  laws.  [Applause.] 

Those  of  you  who  advocate  the  doctrine  of  State  rights  can  have  no 


66  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

better  reason  for  advocating  that  doctrine  than  I,  and  can  have  no 
greater  respect  for  it  than  I  have;  but  I  do  say  that,  much  as  I  adhere 
to  the  doctrine  of  State  rights  in  this  Union  of  ours,  yet  after  all  the 
rights  of  the  people  of  the  United  States  are  the  chief  care  and  trust 
of  the  Democracy.  [Applause.] 

Let  me  state  my  case  before  you.  If  you  understand  it  you  cannot 
decide  it  against  me.  The  National  Committee  of  the  Democratic  party 
at  its  last  meeting  adopted  a  resolution  calling  this  Convention,  an&gt;! 
among  other  things  it  adopted  a  resolution  declaring  that  State  com- 
mittees should  have  the  right  to  provide  for  the  selection  of  delegates  to 
this  Convention  in  any  manner  they  saw  fit,  so  long  as  no  State  law 
imposed  a  mandatory  method.  We  start,  therefore,  with  the  word  of 
the  body  that  called  us  into  existence,  the  National  Committee  of  this 
party,  telling  the  Ohio  State  committee  that  they  could  provide  for  the 
election  of  district  delegates  in  any  manner  they  saw  fit,  so  long  as  Ohio 
\  had  not  by  law  provided  a  mandatory  method.  But  when  Ohio  has  by 
law  provided  a  method,  then,  in  the  language  of,  and  by  the  plain 
intendment  of  the  enactment  of  this  National  Committee,  that  law  is  the 
voice  of  the  State.  [Applanse.] 

In  Ohio  we  have  had  for  more  than  two  years,  and  had  at  the  time 
that  that  resolution  was  adopted  by  the  National  Committee,  a  law 
providing  that  district  delegates  to  national  political  conventions  shall 
be  elected  in  the  districts  by  the  electors  of  those  districts.  And  not 
only  that,  but  so  desirous  was  the  legislature  of  Ohio  to  free  the  election 
of  delegates  to  this  Convention  from  any  control  by  State  conventions 
that  it  provided  that  even  their  nomination  should  not  be  by  convention, 
but  by  a  petition  circulated  in  the  district  and  signed  by  not  less  than 
two  per  cent  of  the  electors  of  that  district,  of  that  particular  party. 
[Applause.]  Prior  to  that  time  in  Ohio  political  parties  had  been  vol- 
untary political  associations,  and,  therefore,  so  long  as  they  were  thus 
unrecognized  by  law,  a  National  Convention  of  the  Democratic  party  had 
always  said  that  the  highest  political  tribunal  in  the  party  in  a  State 
having  no  law  recognizing  political  parties  should  be  the  State  conven- 
tion; and  to  that  doctrine  I  yield  my  ready  adherence.  But  when  the 
legislature  of  the  State  of  Ohio,  at  the  insistent  demand  of  those  in  that 
State  who  believed  then  and  believe  now  that  the  mission  of  Democracy 
is  to  restore  to  the  people  the  powers  of  government,  took  away  from 
State  conventions  the  power  to  select  and  gave  authority  to  district  dele- 
gates, and  by  solemn  enactment  of  the  legislature  of  that  State,  signed 
by  its  governor,  provided  that  those  who  were  to  be  representatives  of 
the  districts  should  be  nominated  in  and  elected  by  the  districts,  then  the 
reason  for  that  old  unit  rule  was  gone,  and  of  course  it  ought  not  to  !&gt;&lt;• 
applied  after  the  reason  for  it  ceased.  [Applause.]  " 

I  shall  not  mention  the  name  of  any  candidate  for  President.  I  do 
not  want  to  appeal  to  any  prejudice  here,  either  favorable  or  unfavor- 
able. I  want  to  argue  this  case  to  you  as  a  la\\ycr  and  win  it  on  my 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  67 

rights.  [Applause.]  In  Ohio  I  ran  for  district  delegate  in  the  Twenty- 
first  Congressional  District.  I  live  in  a  great  city  of  600,000  people,  a 
city  that  is  set  like  a  gem  on  the  southern  shore  of  Lake  Erie.  I  said 
to  my  people,  "If  I  am  elected  a  delegate  I  will  vote  in  .the  National 
Convention  for  whatever  presidential  candidate  you  in  this  district  shall 
prefer  by  your  majority. "  [Applause.]  They  believed  me.  They  knew 
I  would  do  as  I  promised  if  I  were  permitted  so  to  do,  and  my  case 
here  as  a  representative  of  those  people  is  to  ask  you  to  allow  me  to 
fulfill  my  pledge,  and  to  keep  me  from  being  prevented  from  fulfilling  it. 
[Applause.] 

After  that  election  was  over  I  received,  not  from  any  political  con- 
vention or  committee,  but  under  the  great  seal  of  the  State  of  Ohio,  by 
authority  of  the  secretary  of  State,  a  certificate  stating  that  I  am  a  duly 
elected  and  accredited  delegate  -to  this  Convention ;  and  if  there  had  never 
been  any  State  convention  in  Ohio,  I  would  still  be  here  with  all  the 
powers  that  I  now  have,  and  all  the  instructions  that  I  could  get. 

My  point  is  this:  I  ran  in  a  district  where  I  received  7,000  votes. 
Later  a  convention  was  held  in  the  State,  that  convention  being  attended 
by  900  people.  My  authority  and  my  instructions  are  from  the  7,000 
and  not  from  the  900.  [Applause.]  That  situation  was  fully  recognized 
in  Ohio  by  the  State  committee. 

When  the  Democratic  State  committee  met  in  Ohio,  it  met  to  call  a 
State  convention,  and  to  provide  for  the  selection  of  delegates  at  large 
to  that  State  convention;  for,  while  our  State  statute  provided  for  the 
selection  of  district  delegates,  it  made  no  provision  on  the  subject"  of 
delegates  at  large.  So  the  Democratic  State  committee  called  a  State 
convention,  but  it  was  not  called  for  the  purpose  of  instructing  anybody. 
The  call  issued  by  the  committee  for  the  convention,  which  call  I  hold 
in  my  hand,  says  that  the  purpose  of  that  State  convention  is  to  pass 
resolutions — manifestly  a  State  platform — to  have  a  committee  on  cre- 
dentials and  to  select  candidates  for  State  officers.  That  was  its  func- 
tion. Then  they  passed  a  resolution  proposed  by  my  friend  from  Ohio 
(Mr.  Moore)  who  represents  the  other  side  of  this  question,  which  reso- 
lution called  for  a  State-wide  preferential  primary.  He  himself  called 
it  this  afternoon  a  soap-box  primary,  because  it  was  not  recognized  by 
law,  but  an  extra-legal  voluntary  submission  of  a  State-wide  preferential 
primary.  This  call  provides  what  shall  be  the  consequence  of  that.  It 
provides  that  the  secretary  of  State  shall  certify  to  the  State  convention 
the  result  of  the  State-wide  preferential  primary,  and  that  the  candidate 
for  President  who  has  received  the  largest  number  of  votes  in  that  State- 
wide preferential  primary  shall  have  the  right  to  submit  to  the  State 
convention  the  names  of  six  delegates  at  large  and  six  alternates  at  large 
for  the  ratification  of  the  State  convention;  but  there  is  not  a  syllable 
in  it  which  says  that  such  State  convention  when  called  shall  have  any 
right  to  instruct  delegates  already  elected,  with  their  credentials  issuer 


68  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

under  the  great  seal  of  the  State  of  Ohio  already  in  their  pockets,  and 
perhaps  paying  no  attention  to  what  they  say.  [Applause.] 

Gentlemen,  my  time  has  expired.  I  have  time  only  for  one  thing 
more.  I  gave  my  solemn  promise  to  the  people  in  my  district  that  I 
would  vote  as  they  voted.  Now,  for  some  reason,  men  elected  for  an 
entirely  different  purpose  are  appealing  to  a  tradition  that  has  no  appli- 
cation, and  are  conjuring  up  an  attack  upon  a  doctrine  which  I  perhaps 
hold  to  be  more  sacred  than  they  do.  They  are  seeking  for  some  reason 
to  prevent  me  from  carrying  out  the  pledge  I  made  to  the  people  of 
my  district.  The  pledge  of  a  Democrat  made  when  he  is  a  candidate 
for  office  ought  to  be  inviolate,  and  every  Democrat  ought  to  rally  to 
the  support  of  a  man  who  wants  to  carry  out  his  pledge.  [Applause.] 

So  far  as  this  particular  question  is  concerned,  Ohio  as  a  sovereign 
State  speaks  through  her  statute  book,  an.d  not  by  a  scant  majority  of 
a  convention  called  for  another  purpose,  seeking  to  legislate  upon  a 
matter  withdrawn  from  its  jurisdiction  by  the  enactment  of  the  law- 
making  power.  [Applause.] 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  Congressman  Covington  yields  twenty 
minutes  to  Judge  Moore  of  Ohio. 

MR.  ED.  H.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  I  come  here  demanding  fair  play.  While  the  gentleman 
who  has  just  addressed  you  stated  the  truth  so  far  as  he  went,  he  did 
not  state  all  the  truth.  If  the  Democratic  party  that,  since  its  birth, 
has  stood  for  the  doctrine  of  State  rights,  desires  to  abolish  the  unit 
rule  and  to  recognize  this  country  as  a  nation  made  up  of  districts,  I 
yield  the  point;  but  in  the  interests  of  fair  play  and  common  justice  I 
demand  that  no  cunningly  worded  resolution,  drawn  to  be  applied 
expressly  to  Ohio,  shall  prevail  at  the  hands  of  a  fair-minded  Demo- 
cratic convention.  [Applause.] 

The  gentleman  says  that  he  stands  for  the  principle  that  the  will 
of  the  people  is  supreme.  I  deny  that  he  stands  for  that  principle.  He 
stands  for  overriding  the  will  of  the  people  as  expressed  at  the  polls 
in  our  State.  He  says  that  he  pledged  himself  to  abide  by  the  will 
of  the  Democratic  voters  in  his  district,  and  well  he  might,  because 
nobody  ran  against  him.  With  3,000  job-holders  and  a  machine  as  per- 
fect as  Tammany  supporting  him,  we  knew  it  was  useless  to  run  any- 
body against  him,  and  I  drew  up  and  introduced  in  the  State  Central 
Committee  this  plan  for  a  State  wide  preference  primary  in  order  that 
tli«  will  of  the  voters  of  our  State,  uninfluenced  by  job-holders  and 
machines,  might  be  made  known.  The  gentleman  himself  voted  for 
that  resolution  as  a  member  of  the  State  Central  Committee.  [Ap- 
plause.] I  maintain  that  having  submitted  his  cause  and  that  of  his 
candidate  to  the  voters  of  our  party  in  the  State,  he  is  now  estopped 
from  undertaking  to  override  that  expressed  will. 

Let  us  have  the  facts  in  this  case.     The  gentleman  says  he  wants  to 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  c.o 

have  it  decided  purely  on  the  facts.  So  do  I.  Judge  us  for  our  cause 
and  hear  me  that  ye  may  judge. 

Under  the  law  of  our  State  there  is  no  power  whatsoever  in  the 
statute  that  permits  any  candidate  for  delegate  to  express  on  the 
ballot  his  Presidential  preference.  You  in  the  neighboring  State  of 
Pennsylvania  have  the  right  given  you  by  law  to  express  your  Presi- 
dential preference  on  the  ballot,  and  the  voters  can  instruct  you  at  your 
primary.  You  in  Illinois  have  a  preference  primary  that  in  its  terms 
is  made  an  advisory  primary.  Here  in  Maryland  you  have  a  preference 
primary  which,  in  the  terms  of  the  statute,  imposes  a  binding  instruc- 
tion on  the  delegates;  but  in  Ohio  we  have  no  such  thing.  The  name 
of  the  candidate  simply  goes  upon  the  ballot.  There  may  be  four  or 
five  or  a  dozen  candidates  for  delegate,  and  there  is  no  method  by 
which  the  voter  can  ascertain  the  preference  of  the  candidate,  and  no 
method  by  which  the  candidate  can  be  instructed.  So  after  we  had 
adopted  this  State  wide  preference  primary,  in  order  that  the  people 
might  speak,  the  result  was  that,  in  ten  districts  out  of  the  twenty- 
cne,  one,  and  in  many  instances  two,  delegates  were'  elected  whose 
Presidential  preferences,  as  ascertained  from  their  expressions  in  the 
public  prints,  are  contra-distinguished  from  the  will  of  the  voters  as 
expressed  at  the  primary;  and  if  you  deny  to  the  Democrats  of  the 
sovereign  State  of  Ohio  in  convention  assembled  the  power  to  instruct 
its  delegates,  then  that  power  rests  nowhere  and  cannot  be  exercised  at 
all.  I  maintain  that  as  an  essential  of  representative  government  the 
people  have  a  right  to  instruct  their  representatives;  and  remember 
this  is  not  a  question  of  selection;  it  is  a  question  of  instruction. 
|  Applause.] 

The  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  Henry),  who  has  stood  here  advo- 
cating the  cause  of  the  minority  report  and  protesting  against  the  unit 
rule  in  Ohio,  comes  from  a  State  which,  through  its  State  convention, 
imposed  a  cast-iron  unit  rule  on  its  delegates.  You  will  understand 
that  it  makes  a  lot  of  difference  in  political  conventions  whose  ox  is 
gored.  [Applause.] 

Now  in  closing  I  want  to  repeat,  because  this  is  a  thing  to  keep 
before  your  eyes  all  the  time,  that  if  you  ignore  these  instructions  in 
my  State,  in  district  after  district,  you  will  have  delegates  here  voting 
against  the  candidate  who  carried  the  preference  primary  in  the  district 
from  which  he  was  chosen.  Governor  Harmon  carried  my  own  district 
by  nearly  a  thousand  majority.  Yet  we  have  the  curious  situation  that 
I,  favoring  him,  was  elected  a  delegate,  and  my  antagonist,  opposed  to 
him,  was  also  elected.  There  was  no  power  given  us  to  express  our 
preference  on  the  ballot. 

The  gentleman  who  has  preceded  me  on  this  platform  has  talked 
about  pledges.  The  candidate  to  whom  I  referred,  who  was  elected 
against  the  expressed  will  of  the  voters  in  my  district,  pledged  himself 
before  the  election  that  if  the  district  was  carried  for  Governor  Harmon 


70  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

he  would  resign,  and  yet  he  is  here  in  this  Convention  voting  against 
him.  [Applause.]  And  that  is  the  ease  with  every  other  delegate 
here  who  is  opposed  to  Governor  Harmon,  with  few  exceptions.  I  ask 
that  the  will  of  the  Democracy  of  the  State  of  Ohio,  as  expressed  in 
its  primaries,  be  enforced.  [Applause.] 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. 
Henry),  representing  the  minority  report,  yields  fifteen  minutes  to  the 
gentleman  from  Mississippi,  Senator  Williams.  [Applause.] 

MR.  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi.  Mr.  Chairman  and 
fellow  delegates  of  the  National  Democratic  Convention,  I  imagine  that 
'.f  there  be  a  man  in  the  United  States  who  stands  for  state  rights  in 
the  minds  of  those  who  know  him,  that  man  is  myself.  [Applause.] 
But  the  point  raised  by  the  gentleman  is  this — as  to  whether  you  shall 
recognize  the  right  of  a  State  as  a  political  organism,  assembled  in  an 
accidental  convention,  or  whether  you  shall  recognize  the  rights  of  the 
people  of  the  State  and  the  rights  of  the  people  of  the  district  in  a 
primary  election,  where  every  citizen  casts  his  ballot  for  himself.  As 
between  the  State  as  a  name  and  the  people  of  the  State  or  the  district, 
in  my  mind  "The  People"  is  the  State.  [Applause.] 

Fellow  delegates,  I  have  never  had  presented  to  me  in  my  life  a 
question  that  was  plainer  than  this.  Upon  yesterday,  when  I  voted- 
for  the  honorable  Temporary  Chairman  of  this  Convention,  they  told 
me  that  he  would  be  subject  to  the  orders  of  the  New  York  and 
Illinois  and  other  bosses  of  the  United  States  when  he  made  his  rulings 
upon  points  of  order.  I  did  not  believe  it  then  and  I  do  not  believe 
it  now,  and  I  never  shall  believe  it.  This  is  a  question  to  be  argued 
to  the  Chairman  of  this  Convention,  and  I  shall  argue  it  to  him. 

MR.  EARL  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  Will  the  gentleman  yield  for  a 
question? 

ME.  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:    Yes,  I  will  yield. 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  I  wish  to  ask  the  gentleman  this 
question:  In  the  primary  election  in  the  State  of  Ohio  for  whom 
did  the  primary  election  as  a  whole  instruct  the  delegates? 

MR.  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  Oh,  Mr.  Chairman  and 
fellow  delegates,  what  absolute  childishness  is  expressed  by  that  ques- 
tion! What  absolute  infantillage  is  contained  in  that  question!  [Ap- 
plause.] 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi :    Answer  it  then. 

MR.  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  I  am  answering  it  now. 
Fellow  delegates,  the  plain  question  before  you  is  this — and  this  ques- 
tion does  not  affect  the  State  of  Ohio  alone;  it  affects  every  State  here 
present.  It  does  not  affect  the  first  choice  of  the  delegation  of  any 
State  alone;  it  affects  also  their  second  choice,  after  instructions  are 
released.  Here  is  my  view  in  a  nutshell:  In  any  State  in  the  Union 
where,  by  the  law  of  the  State,  a  convention  has  been  discredited  as  an 
instrumentality  for  the  selection  of  delegates  and  for  the  expression  of 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  71 

popular  opinion  in  a  Presidential  campaign,  a  primary  having  been 
accredited  by  law,  in  that  ease  the  question  is  where  the  Democratic 
people  at  the  primary  shall  vote  for  a  man  representing  a  particular 
candidate  for  the  Presidency,  can  a  convention  incidentally  called  for 
other  purposes  than  the  selection  of  delegates,  add  to  or  subtract  from 
the  instruction  given  by  the  primary  of  the  people?  I  say  it  cannot. 
[Applause.]  I  say  that  when  the  people  of  the  State  of  Mississippi 
elect  me  a  delegate  to .  a  national  convention  as  a  delegate  at  large, 
and  when  they  elect  another  man  as  a  delegate  from  a  district,  he  is 
bound  and  I  am  bound,  each  by  our  respective  constituency.  If  I  am 
a  delegate  at  large,  I  am  bound  by  the  vote  of  the  State.  That  is  my 
answer,  and  this  is  my  answer  to  the  gentleman  from  Mississippi,  Gov- 
ernor Brewer.  If  I  am  a  delegate  from  a  district  where  a  district 
primary  was  ordered,  where  a  district  convention  was  discredited  and  a 
district  primary  accredited,  then  if  a  majority  of  the  people  in  that 
district  vote  for  me,  or  for  the  candidate  for  the  Presidency  whom  I 
represent,  then  I  must  represent  him  as  long  as  he  has  the  remotest  real 
chance.  [Applause.] 

Now,  so  far  as  the  primary  instructs  a  delegate,  he  is  in  honor  bound 
and  instructed  to  the  bitter  end.  Take  my  own  case  in  the  State  of 
Mississippi.  My  voice  and  my  judgment  are  for  one  man  for  the 
Presidency  of  the  United  States.  Mississippi  instructed  me  for  another 
man,  and  I  am  a  delegate  at  large.  I  shall  obey  the  instructions  of 
Mississippi  to  the  bitter  end.  I  shall  obey  those  instructions  until 
that  candidate  for  the  Presidency  sends  me  personally  or  through 
another  announces  the  word  that  he  is  out  of  the  race,  or  until  my 
delegation  desides  that  he  is  out  of  the  race.  So  much  for  that.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

But  suppose  I  am  running  in  a  district.  Suppose  the  State  law  calls 
a  district  primary.  Suppose  that  in  that  district  primary  the  ballots 
are  cast  for  a  Presidential  preference.  Suppose  that  Presidential 
preference  vote  goes  for- Mr.  A,  and  I  am  in  favor  of  Mr.  A;  but  my 
opponent  Mr.  B  is  opposed  to  Mr.  A.  Suppose  both  my  opponent  and 
myself  are  elected.  I  take  it  that  both  of  us  are  bound  by  the  voice  of 
the  people  in  that  district;  and  I  take  it  that  a  convention  called  for 
another  purpose,  or  for  general  purposes,  but  not  accredited  by  law 
with  the  power  of  selecting  delegates,  as  was  the  case  not  only  in 
Ohio  but  in  Mississippi,  has  no  power  under  God  and  no  power  by 
the  will  of  man  to  add  to  or  subtract  fsom  the  instructions  given  me, 
or  given  Mr.  B,  by  the  vote  of  the  people  in.  the  primary  election. 
Why?  Because  in  such  a  case  the  State  of  Mississippi  or 'the  State 
of  Ohio  has  selected  a  primary  election  as  the  instrumentality  for  the 
selection  of  delegates,  and  has  discredited  a  convention  for  that  pur- 
pose. [Applause.] 

The  authority  which  creates  an  agent  is  the  only  authority  which 
can  instruct  him  in  the  exercise  of  the  duties  of  his  agency. 


72  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Some  gentlemen  here  tonight  have  talked  about  the  "time-honored 
rulings"  of  Democratic  chairmen  of  Democratic  conventions.  Yes,  not 
only  one  or  two,  but  three  or  four  chairmen  of  Democratic  conventions 
have  ruled  that  when  a  State  convention  passed  a  resolution  in  favor 
of  the  unit  rule,  that  resolution  bound  the  national  convention,  because, 
believing  in  State  rights,  as  the  Democratic  party  does  and  always 
did,  we  deny  that  a  national  convention  of  the  Democracy  can  set 
aside  the  dictates  and  instructions  of  a  State  convention.  I  myself,  as 
chairman  of  a  Democratic  convention,  once  made  exactly  that  ruling; 
but  the  ruling  is  not  on  all  fours  with  this  at  all.  In  every  such  case 
the  convention  selected  the  delegates,  and  as  the  delegates  were  the 
creatures  of  the  convention,  the  convention  had  a  right  to  limit  and 
restrict  the  exercise  of  the  powers  of  the  delegates,  because  they  were 
the  creatures  of  that  convention;  but  when  the  delegates  are  the  choice 
and  creatures  of  a  primary  election  of  the  people,  then  a  convention  can 
no  longer  say  that  the  delegates  are  their  creatures.  And  not  being 
the  creatures  of  the  convention,  not  being  born  of  the  convention,  the 
convention  cannot  restrain  or  limit"  the  exercise  of  the  power  of  the 
delegates.  The  only  power  under  God  which  can  do  that  is  the  power 
that  created  them,  and  that  is  the  power  that  elected  them  in  their 
districts,  or,  if  they  are  delegates  at  large,  the  power  that  elected 
them  in  their  States.  [Applause.] 

I  tell  you,  gentlemen  of  this  Convention,  I  am  not  going  to  do  as 
various  people  here  have  done — boast  about  my  devotion  to  the  Demo- 
cratic party.  I  have  stood  up  year  after  year  and  have  done  my 
humble  duty  as  I  understand  it;  but  I  tell  you  that  in  my  opinion  if 
you  adopt  the  majority  report  of  the  Committee  on  Eules  tonight  with- 
out modification  or  amendment,  you  will  do  the  most  dangerous  and  the 
most  damnable  thing  in  your  power  to  do  on  this  day  of  the  year  of 
our  Lord's  grace  nineteen  hundred  and  twelve,  and  that  when  you 
get  through  with  it  you  can  quit  your  talk  about  ' '  popular  govern- 
ment. ' '  Everybody  will  understand  that  it  is  all  talk.  You  can  quit 
your  talk  about  carrying  political  operations  and  influence  and  gov- 
ernment "direct  to  the  people,"  for  you  will  be  letting  the  people 
vote  pro  forma  in  district  and  State  primary  elections,  and  then  modify- 
ing or  reversing  their  will  by  a  convention  of  any  sort,  for  any  pur- 
pose. You  will  be  permitting  that  accidental  or  incidental  convention 
of  accidental  or  incidental  delegates  to  instruct  the  sovereign  people 
themselves.  „ 

State's  rights!  Yes,  I  stand  for  State's  rights,  but  I  do  not  stand 
for  the  rights  of  a  State  as  a  mere  political  organism — a  mere  name. 
I  stand  for  the  rights  of  the  people  who  constitute  that  State;  and 
when  it  is  a  question  in  a  district,  I  stand  for  the  rights  of  the  people 
who  constitute  that  district. 

Now  it  seems  that  not  only  in  Ohio  but  in  several  other  States, 
my  own  included,  a  State  primary  was  called  to  elect  State  delegates, 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  73 

and  in  each  district  to  elect  district  delegates.  The  gentleman  says 
that  the  man  whom  he  answered  had  no  opposition.  No;  but  the  can- 
didate for  the  Presidency  whom  he  represented,  and  the  candidate  for 
the  Presidency  whom  he  opposed,  were  both  voted  for  in  that  election 
at  the  same  time  when  the  vote  was  cast  for  the  delegates.  There 
was  the  real  contest.  [Applause.] 

I  understand  that  my  time  is  up,  and  so  I  conclude. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. 
Henry)  yields  ten  minutes  to  Mr.  Dunn,  of  Nebraska. 

MR.  ALEXANDER  D.  PITTS,  of  Alabama:     I  want  to  ask  a  question. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :  Does  the  gentleman  rise  to  a  parlia- 
mentary inquiry? 

MR.  PITTS,  of  Alabama  :    I  do.    I  wish  to  ask  a  question  for  information. 

THE  TEMPORARY  (  JIAIKMAN:      The  Lentleman  will  state  it. 

MR.  PITTS,  of  Alabama:  I  want  information  given  to  the  delegates 
here  as  to  the  substance  of  the  call  for  the  presidential  primary  in  Ohio. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  That  is  not  a  parliamentary  inquiry. 
The  gentleman  from  Nebraska  (Mr.  I.  J.  Dunn)  is  recognized  for  ten 
minutes. 

MR.  I.  J.  DUNN,  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  as  member  from  Nebraska  on  your  Committee  on  Kules  I 
desire  to  state  briefly  why  I  am  in  favor  of  the  adoption  of  the  resolu- 
tion presented  by  the  minority.  [Applause.] 

The  direct  primary  is  a  Democratic  principle,  rnd  it  has  come  to 
May.  In  the  next  national  convention  there  will  be  more  Democrats 
elected  by  direct  primary  vote  than  there  are  in  this  convention.  It  is 
a  growing  Democratic  principle.  It  has  been  said  by  one  of  the  gentle- 
men from  Ohio,  or  one  of  the  gentlemen  who  have  addressed  you,  that 
the  State  is  the  unit  of  political  and  governmental  power.  That  is  true; 
but  remember  that  the  State  as  the  unit  may  delegate  its  power  to  its 
political  subdivisions,  and  that  is  what  the  State  of  Ohio  did.  The  legis- 
lature of  the  State  of  Ohio  provided  by  law  that  the  unit  of  govern- 
mental and  political  power,  so  far  as  the  election  of  delegates  to  the 
national  convention  was  concerned,  should  be  exercised  by  the  people  of 
tin-  \arious  congressional  districts,  and  the  district  delegates  to  this  con 
veution  come  here  by  authority  given  by  the  State  of  Ohio  through  ite 
laws,  its  legislature,  and  its  executive  department. 

It  is  contended  here  that  there  was  a  state-wide  presidential  prefer- 
ence primary  in  Ohio.  That  is  true,  but  whence  did  the  authority  come 
to  hold  a  State-wide  presidential  preference  primary?  It  came  from  the 
State  central  committee.  It  was  a  voluntary  matter  on  the  part  of  the 
State  central  committee ;  but  the  district  primary,  the  vote  by  which  Mr. 
Baker  and  ether  district  delegates  were  sent  to  this  convention,  was 
held  under  authority  of  a  law  of  the  State,  and  those  district  delegates 
come  here  because  the  people,  acting  under  tin-  laws  of  the  State  of  Ohio. 
voted  to  send  them  here. 


74  OFFICIAL  PHOCEEDINGS  OF  Tin; 

If  Democrats  are  in  favor  of  State  sovereignty  and  of  State  rule,  of 
local  self-government  and  the  will  of  the  people  being  carried  out,  then 
I  ask  you,  which  do  you  believe  ought  to  be  binding  upon  a  Democratic 
national  convention — a  State-wide  primary  called  by  the  Democratic 
State  Central  Committee  of  Ohio  without  recognition  in  the  State  law, 
or  a  district  primary  called  and  held  under  authority  of  law,  where 
every  Democrat  was  given  an  opportunity  to  cast  his  vote  under  the  law 
of  that  sovereign  State?  Is  the  law  of  the  State  Central  Committee  of 
Ohio,  or  of  the  State  Convention,  greater  than  the  law  of  the  State  of 
Ohio,  which  represents  the  majesty  and  will  of  the  sovereign  people  of 
that  State? 

You  are  asked  here  now  to  set  aside  the  will  of  the  people  of  the 
districts.  You  cannot  do  it  unless  you  say  that  either  the  national  com- 
mittee of  the  Democratic  party  or  the  national  convention  of  the  Demo- 
cratic party  has  power  to  abrogate  a  State  law,  and  say  that  the  people 
of  Ohio  have  not  the  power  to  provide  how  delegates,  either  at  large  or 
from  the  districts,  shall  be  elected.  The  question  before  you  is  not  one 
of  abrogating  the  unit  rule,  but  it  is  rather  a  question  whether  a  few 
men  shall  abrogate  and  destroy  the  will  of  the  people  of  the  State  of 
Ohio  in  nine  congressional  districts.  [Applause.] 

It  has  been  said  by  some  of  these  gentlemen  that  because  the  Demo- 
crats of  Ohio  in  the  various  congressional  districts  did  not  object  to 
their  State-wide  presidential  preference  primary,  therefore  that  vote 
ought  to  govern  and  control.  It  cannot  be  logically  urged  here  that  the 
State-wide  primary,  held  under  the  call  of  the  State  Central  Committee, 
ought  to  be  recognized  as  binding  upon  this  convention  and  the  will  of 
all  -the  Democrats  who  voted  under  the  State  law  in  the  congressional 
districts  ought  to  be  disregarded.  Your  national  committee  in  its  call 
invited  the  Democrats  of  the  nation  to  elect  their  delegates  to  this  con- 
vention according  to  State  law.  Here  it  is.  The  resolution  passed  by 
the  National  Committee  calls  for  the  election  of  delegates  to  this  Con- 
vention in  whatever  manner  the  States  have  provided  for  the  election  of 
delegates. 

The  State  of  Ohio  and  my  State  of  Nebraska  responded  to  that  call 
of  the  National  Committee,  and  elected  their  delegates  to  this  Conven- 
tion according  to  State  law.  It  is  now  proclaimed  as  Democratic  Doc- 
trine that  this  Convention  shall  abrogate  that  State  law  and  destroy  the 
will  of  the  people  as  expressed  in  the  Ohio  districts.  Gentlemen,  that  is 
not  Democracy.  It  is  not  State  or  local  self-government.  If  you  adopt 
the  majority  resolution  presented  by  the  majority  report  here  tonight  you 
will  be  violating  a  fundamental  Democratic  principle,  and  I  do  not 
believe  you  will  do  it.  [Applause.] 

MR.  EGBERT  L.  HENRY,  of  Texas:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  in  less  than  ten  minutes  the  Convention  will  be  able  to 
vote  on  this  question. 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  75 

Since  the  beginning  of  this  debate  the  State  of  Virginia,  the  mother 
of  the  doctrine  of  State  sovereignty,  has  come  in  and  signed  the  minority 
report.  T  hold  in  my  hand  the  credentials  of  one  of  the  delegates  elected 
in  the  State  of  Ohio,  and  those  credentials  are  signed  by  the  State  Elec- 
tion Board,  certifying  that  such  delegate  has  been  elected  by  the  voters 
of  his  district,  and  thereby  signifying  that  neither  the  State  nor  National 
(  (invention  should  nullify  the  action  of  the  sovereign  people  in  that  dls 
trict.  [Applause.] 

In  conclusion,  I  will  make  one  more  statement,  that  when  a  primary 
election  was  held  in  a  certain  State  of  this  Union,  and  it  was  said  thai 
two  districts  which  had  gone  against  a  certain  candidate  for  President 
(Woodrow  Wilson)  should  be  placed  under  the  unit  rule,  although  the 
State  had  gone  for  him  the  candidate  said,  "No.  Take  the  hand  of  the 
State  convention  off  of  those  districts  that  have  spoken  their  will,  and 
let  those  four  delegates  of  New  Jersey  vote  as  they  please."  [Applause.] 

MR.  J.  1  TARRY  OOVIXGTOX,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  yield  five 
minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Ohio  (Mr.  Moore). 

MK.  ED.  H.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:  Gentlemen,  I  am  going  to  take  only 
enough  of  your  time  to  correct  certain  misstatements  which,  I  have  no 
doubt  unintentionally,  have  been  made  by  every  speaker  hailing  from  an 
outside  State  who  has  spoken  with  reference  to  the  law  in  our  State. 
The  question  has  not  been  properly  stated  by  the  gentlemen  who  have 
appeared  on  the  other  side.  We  are  not  asking  the  abrogation  of  any 
instructions.  No  district  could  instruct,  under  our  law,  and  that  is  what 
\ve  complain  about. 

We  are  not  trying  to  unseat  delegates.  We  want  to  compel  delegates 
to  abide  by  their  instructions. 

MR.  EARL  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  Will  the  gentleman  yield  for  a 
question? 

MR.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:     Yes. 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi :  I  understand  you  had  a  State-wide  pri- 
mary in  Ohio? 

MR.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:     Yes. 

Mi;.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:     Whom  did  it  go  for? 

MR.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:     Harmon. 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi :  I  understand  you  had  a  State  conven- 
tion of  the  Democratic  party  in  Ohio? 

MR.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:     Yes. 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:     Whom  did  it  go  for? 

MR.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:     Harmon,  by  two  to  one. 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  Then  I  understand  Harmon  carried 
the  State  in  the  primary  election? 

MR.  MOORE,  of  Ohio :     Yes. 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  And  he  carried  it  in  the  Democratic 
convention ;  and  now  they  want  to  take  part  of  it  away  from  him.  la 
that  true? 


76  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:  Yes.  That  is  enough,  gentlemen.  That  states 
the  question. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  now  is  upon  the  adoptioa 
of  the  minority  report  presented  by  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr. 
Henry). 

MR.  COVINGTON,  of  Maryland:  Upon  that  I  demand  the  yeas  and 
nays. 

The  yeas  and  nays  were  ordered. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  Those  in  favor  of  the  minority  report 
will  vote  "Yea";  those  in  favor  of  the  majority  report  will  vote 
"Nay."  The  clerk  will  call  the  roll  by  States. 

MR.  E.  D.  SMITH,  of  South  Carolina:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  delegates 
around  me  do  not  understand  the  question.  We  do  not  know  whether 
we  are  to  vote  on  the  majority  report  or  the  minority  report. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :  The  question  is  on  the  adoption  of 
the  minority  report. 

MR.  G.  M.  HITCHCOCK,  of  Nebraska:     Let  the  resolution  be  read. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :     The  secretary  will  report  the  resolution. 

The  secretary  read  the  resolution,  as  follows: 

"Eesched,  That  in  casting  votes  on  a  call  of  the  States  the  Chair 
shall  recognize  and  enforce  a  unit  rule  enacted  by  a  State  convention, 
except  in  such  States  as  have  by  mandatory  statute  provided  for  the 
nomination  and  election  of  delegates  and  alternates  to  national  political 
conventions  in  Congressional  districts  and  have  not  subjected  delegates 
so  selected  to  the  authority  of  the  State  committee  or  convention  of  the 
party,  in  which  case  no  such  rule  shall  be  held  to  apply. ' ' 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  report  just  read  is  the  minority 
report.  Those  in  favor  of  it  will  vote  "yea,"  and  those  opposed  to  it 
will  vote  "nay"  when  the  roll  is  called.  The  minority  report  is  the 
Henry  report,  and  the  majority  report  is  the  Covington  report. 

The  secretary  having  called  the  roll,  the  result  was  announced,  yeas 
565*,  nays  492 J,  not  voting  36 £,  as  follows:

78  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

So  the  minority  report  was  agreed  to. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  effect  of  this  vote  is  to  amend 
the  majority  report  by  substituting  for  it  the  minority  report.  The 
majority  report  having  been  amended  by  the  adoption  of  the  minority 
report,  the  question  now  is  on  the  original  report  as  amended. 

The  report  as  amended  was  agreed  to. 

REPORT  OF  THE  COMMITTEE  ON  CREDENTIALS. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on 
Credentials,  Mr.  Joseph  E.  Bell,  of  Indiana,  will  now  present  the  report 
of  that  committee. 

Mr.  Joseph  E.  Bell,  of  Indiana,  presented  the  report  of  the  Com- 
mittee on  Credentials,  as  follows: 
' '  To  the  Democratic  National  Convention : 

"Your  Committee  on  Credentials  respectfully  submit  their  report 
as  follows: 

"1.  In  the  State  of  Illinois  contests  were  presented  and  consid- 
ered as  to  all  delegates  at  large  and  all  alternates  at  large;  also  con-

PBAYEE  OF  EABBI  ADOLPH  GUTTMACHEB. 

Eabbi  Adolph  Guttmaeher,  of  Madison  Avenue"  Temple,  Baltimore, 
Maryland,  offered  the  following  prayer: 

Lord  of  the  Universe,  from  generation  to  'generation  Thou  hast 
been  the  Eock  of  our  life,  the  Shield  of  our  Salvation;  Thou  art  the 
Light  of  the  hearts  that  cleave  to  Thee,  the  Life  of  the  souls  that  love 
Thee,  the  Strength  of  the  thoughts  that  seek  Thee.  Let  the  Light  of 
Thy  countenance  shine  upon  us.  Cause  us  to  rise  to  the  height  of  our 
duties  and  obligations;  cause  us  to  realize  the  greatness  of  our  re- 
sponsibilities. Inspire  us  with  love  and  devotion,  so  that  we  may  fulfill 
with  one  heart  and  one  mind  the  hopes  and  expectations  of  those  who 
place  their  trust  in  us.  Guide  us  in  the  way  of  peace  and  unity,  loy- 
alty and  truth.  Grant,  we  beseech  Thee,  wisdom  and  courage  to  those 
assembled  here  in  convention  as  the  representatives  of  millions  of 
their  fellow-citizens,  to  choose  a  Chief  Magistrate  for  this  our  nation. 
•May  they  administer  their  trust  in  the  fear  of  God  and  with  a  true 
heart. 

We  thank  Thee,  O  Lord  our  God,  for  the  bounteous  blessings  Thoi; 
hast  bestowed  upon  our  beloved  country.  May  we  prove  ourselves 
worthy  of  the  blessings  that  have  fallen  to  our  share,  not  only  rejoic- 
ing in  the  privileges,  but  willingly  and  loyally  take  our  part  in  all  the 
duties  and  responsibilities  of  our  citizenship.  Through  Thy  Provi- 
dence we  have  grown  from  a  small  beginning  to  a  nation  strong  and 
great.  Let  us  use  our  might  and  strength  for  justice  and  in  behalf 
of  the  weak  and  oppressed,  here  and  everywhere.  May  this  nation  lead 
all  other  nations,  not  by  the  strength  of  its  armies,  but  by  virtue  of  its 
supremacy,  in  all  that  makes  for  the  dignity  of  man,  for  the  rights  of 
mankind,  for  peace  and  prosperity.  Keep  before  our  eyes  the  lofty 
ideals  of  our  Eepublic  that  all  government  must  be  moral  in  its  aim 
and  end,  and  that  nothing  morally  wrong  can  be  politically  right.

We  pray  for  our  land.  Grant,  we  beseech  of  Thee,  that  Thy

soul  unto  Thee.  Amen.

MR.  ROLAND  S.  MORRIS,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gen- 
tlemen of  the  Convention,  I  desire  to  submit,  on  behalf  of  twenty-two

MR.  ROLAND  S.  MORRIS,  of  Pennsylvania:  Gentlemen,  in  support  of 
this  minority  report  I  simply  want  to  make  one  or  two  very  brief  state- 
ments of  fact. 

In  referring  to  the  fact  that  we  had  a  primary  election  in  Soufh 
Dakota  it  will  be  necessary  to  mention  the  names  of  the  leading  candi- 
dates for  the  presidency  before  this  Convention.  As.  I  am  particularly 
anxious  that  you  should  have  these  facts  before  you  as  the  minority  of 
the  Committee  had  them,  may  I  be  bold  enough  to  ask  that  you  will  not 
use  these  names,  when  they  are  mentioned,  as  the  occasion  for  an  ex- 
pression of  preference.  By  refraining  from  so  doing  we  can  more 
quickly  get  to  the  point. 

The  fact;*'  are  that  in  South  Dakota  they  had  a  State-wide  primary. 
That  primary  was  to  be  held  on  June  4  of  this  year  to  elect  delegates  to 
this  Convention.  Three  sets  of  tickets  were  put  in  the  field  on  the 
Democratic  side. 

The  first  ticket  was  entitled  under  a  motto,  used  under  the  law  of 
South  Dakota,  as  the  ' '  Wilson-Bryan  Progressive  Democracy. ' ' 

Some  days  afterward  another  ticket  entitled  the  "Wilson-Bryan- 
Clark  Democracy"  was  filed,  with  an  entirely  different  set  of  delegates. 

On  the  last  day  on  which  they  could  file  any  ticket  for  the  primary, 
a  third  ticket  was  filed  entitled  "Champ  Clark  for  President." 

Those  three  tickets  wont  to  the  primary  on  June  4,  and  the  first  ot 
those  tickets  received  approximately,  in  round  figures,  4,600  votes.  The 
second  ticket,  composed  of  absolutely  different  men,  received  4,200  votes, 
and  the  third  ticket  received  2,700  votes. 

When  the  returns  were  in,  the  State  Canvassing  Board,  which  is  the 
duly  authorized  body  to  certify  the  election,  gave  credentials  to  the  dele- 
gates who  had  received  the  plurality  of  votes,  as  they  were  required  to 
do  under  the  law;  but  the  State  chairman  of  the  Democratic  Committee 
in  South  Dakota,  defying  that  law,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  those  dele- 
gates had  concededly  received  a  plurality,  did  the  amazing  thing  of 
adding  the  two  tickets,  the  second  and  third,  together,  because  the  name 
of  Clark  appeared  at  the  top  of  both  of  them,  although  the  delegates 


84  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

were  absolutely  different.  He  contended  that  4,000  plus  2,000  equaled 
6,000,  and  that  therefore  that  beat  4,600. 

When  that  proposition  was  submitted  to  the  National  Comnfittee. 
they  immediately  turned  it  down  unanimously,  and  seated  the  contestants 
here. 

An  appeal  was  taken  to  the  Committee  on  Credentials,  and  1  caff  but 
feel  that  that  Committee  totally  misapprehended  the  facts  of  the  case; 
because,  to  the  amazement  of  the  minority,  they  seated  the  delegates 
whose  votes  were  thus  added  together.  And  note  you,  they  did  not  divide 
the  vote  between  those  two  delegations,  but  they  added  the  two  votes 
together  and  then  seated  the  delegates  on  No.  2  ticket,  although  the 
names  on  No.  2  and  No.  3  tickets  were  absolutely  different. 

If  by  any  chance  we  should  sustain  such  an  unusual  and  remarkable 
finding  of  the  Credentials  Committee,  we  would  absolutely  defy  the  pri- 
mary law  which  gives  to  the  party  receiving  a  plurality  the  right  to  have 
seats  in  this  Convention.  [Applause.]  We  would  go  back  on  every 
statement  that  we  have  made  in  sixteen  years,  that  the  Democratic  party 
is  a  party  of  the  majority,  and  of  the  plurality,  and  that  it  is  for  direct. 
State-wide  primaries,  first,  last  and  all  the  time. 

For  the  reasons  stated,  because  the  contestants  had  a  conceded  plural- 
ity, and  because  they  had  the  duly  authorized  certificate  which  I  have 
here,  I  ask  you  to  sustain  the  amendment  which  I  offer  to  the  majority 
report,  and  to  seat  the  delegates  under  the  motto  ' '  Wilson-Bryan  Pro- 
gressive Democracy.'.' 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :  Governor  William  A.  McCorkle,  of  West 
Virginia,  is  recognized. 

MR.  WILLIAM  A.  McCoRKLE,  of  West  Virginia:  Gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  I  pray  your  attention  for  a  brief  moment  while  I  present  the 
rights  of  a  sovereign  State  for  admission  to  a  vote  on  this  floor.  I  do  not 
represent  any  faction  of  South  Dakota.  I  am  only  acting  under  the 
direction  of  a  majority  of  your  Credentials  Committee,  who  seek  to  make 
a  fair  report,  and  I  will  briefly  give  you  my  reasons  therefor. 

The  State  of  South  Dakota  as  at  present  organized  is  Eepublican. 
The  law  of  that  State  provides  for  a  primary  election.  On  March  1  a 
primary  ticket  was  placed  in  the  field,  and  it  was  headed  under  the  law 
of  South  Dakota,  the  heading  being  ' '  Wilson-Bryan  Progressive  Democ- 
racy. ' ' 

One  month  after  that,  at  a  meeting  of  the  State  Committee,  another 
ticket  was  placed  in  the  field.  That  ticket  was  headed  under  the  law,  and 
the  heading  was  ' '  Wilson-Bryan-Clark  Democracy. ' '  I  regret  that  I  am 
compelled  to  mention  the  names  of  the  candidates.  It  is  necessary,  how- 
ever, to  do  that,  because  of  the  fact  that  their  names  are  the  legend 
of  the  tickets. 

That  ticket  immediately  provoked  a  controversy  in  the  State  of  So.itli 
Dakota.  Men  wanted  to  know  whom  that  ticket  represented,  and  whom 
the  other  ticket  represented.  Immediately  the  people  who  were  on  the 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  85 

second  ticket  made  a  statement  as  to  whom  they  were  for.  That  state- 
ment was  enforced  by  certificates  and  letters  spread  broadcast  over  the 
State  of  South  Dakota.  The  delegates  representing  that  second  ticket 
made  a  statement  to  the  people  of  South  Dakota  and  said  affirmatively 
that  they  would  not  vote  for  Governor  Wilson,  although  his  name  was 
on  the  ticket,  but  that  they  would  vote  for  Champ  Clark  for  President 
under  that  ticket.  [Applause.] 

Now  you  have  in  the  field  two  tickets.  I  do  not  insert  the  truth  of 
the  proposition  which  I  am  about  to  repeat,  but  only  give  you  the 
testimony  before  the  Committee.  It  is  charged  that  in  order  to  divide  the 
Champ  Clark  vote  another  ticket  was  placed  in  the  field,  and  that  ticket 
had  the  legend  "Champ  Clark  for  President." 

It  was  openly  charged  in  South  Dakota  that  that  ticket  \v::s  a  fake 
ticket,  that  it  was  not  entitled  to  be  voted  for  by  those  who  were  in  favor 
of  Champ  Clark,  and  Champ  Clark  himself  sent  a  telegram  to  the  head 
of  the  "Champ  Clark''  ticket  and  asked  him  to  withdraw  that  ticket 
and  to  vote  under  the  other  ticket  for  him  for  President. 

The  Republican  Secretary  of  State  refused  to  allow  that  to  be  done, 
and  when  one  of  the  members  of  that  delegation  asked  permission  to 
withdraw  from  the  ticket  because  it  did  not  represent  Mr.  Clark,  the 
Republican  Secretary  of  State  refused  to  allow  him  to  do  so. 

Now  at  the  election  for  the  presidential  preference  primary  the  first 
ticket,  which  \\'as  known  as  the  Wilson  ticket,  received  4,300  votes;  the 
second  ticket,  which  was  known,  understood  and  stated  to  be  the  ticket 
representing  Champ  Clark,  received  4,700  votes.  The  third  ticket,  which 
was  known  as  the  Champ  Clark  Progressive  ticket  received  2,700  votes, 
thus  giving  8,000  votes  in  the  State  of  South  Dakota  for  those  who 
believed  that  they  were  voting  for  Champ  Clark  for  the  presidency  of  the 
United  States  against  4,300  for  Wilson. 

On  June  39,  under  the  law,  the  Chairman  of  the  Democratic  Executive 
Committee  of  South  Dakota  made  his  certificate  of  the  fact  that  these 
men  on  the  ticket  headed  by  Andrew  E.  Lee  had  received  the  largest  num- 
ber of  votes,  and  that,  as  the  Committee  held,  was  the  correct  official 
certifying  board. 

MB.  LUKE  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  Mr.  Chairman,  will  the  gentleman  yield 
for  a  question? 

MB.  I\IcC'OBKLE,  of  West  Virginia:   Yes,  with  pleasure. 

MR.  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  The  day  after  the  Chairman  of  the  Executive 
Committee  certified  to  that  election,  he  wrote  a  letter  over  his  signature, 
stating  that  he  had  the  returns  from  only  about  sixteen  County  Auditors 
out  of  sixty-two.  My  question  is,  how  can  the  Committee  on  Credentials 
believe  the  certificate  against  this  letter? 

M:;.  McCoBKLE,  of  West  Virginia:  I  will  reply  by  asking  the  gentle- 
man a  question:  How  does  he  stand  upon  a  certificate  issued  on  the  same 
day,  when  the  same  returns  were  in,  liy  a  Republican  Canvassing  Board 
of  the  same  State  t 


86  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  Do  you  want  me  to  answer  the  question? 

MR.  McC'ORKLE,  of  West  Virginia:  Not  now.  The  gentleman  can 
answer  in  his  own  time. 

MR.  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  Let  me  answer  it. 

MR.  McCoRKLE,  of  West  Virginia:  Let  me  finish  what  I  have  to  say. 
The  Credentials  Committee  believed  that  of  the  two  certificates  the  Demo- 
cratic Committee  certificate  was  the  correct  one.  [Applause.]  More 
than  that,  they  believed  furthermore  that  while  the  returns  on  both 
certificates  were  incomplete,'  the  facts  were  that  Champ  Clark  carried  the 
State  of  South  Dakota,  by  people  voting  for  both  tickets,  who  believed 
they  were  voting  for  him,  by  nearly  2,500  majority.  [Applause.] 

Therefore,  gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  the  Committee,  after  con- 
sidering the  matter  carefully,  believing  that  the  delegates  who  were 
seated  were  the  proper  ones,  and  appealing  to  something  higher  and 
grander  than  lawyers  and  officials  and  Eepublican  Returning  Board  cer- 
tificates, believing  in  the  holy  rule  of  Democracy  that  the  majority  should 
govern  wherever  a  vote  is  cast,  recommended  the  seating  of  the  Champ 
Clark  delegates,  as  the  people  in  that  State  intended.  [Applause.] 

MR.  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  been  asked  a  question. 
That  question  is  how  could  the  Secretary  of  State  make  a  return  when 
the  Chairman  of  the  Executive  Committee  said  he  did  not  have  the  re- 
turns? My  answer  is  bec-ause  the  Secretary  of  State  had  those  returns 
and  so  certified. 

I  now  yield  ten  minutes  to  Mr.  Crane,  of  Texas. 

MR.  M.  M.  CRANE,  of  Texas:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  1  come  from  a  Democratic  State  that  always  casts  its  elec- 
toral vote  for  the  Democratic  nominee,  no  matter  whether  he  is  from 
New  York,  Nebraska  or  Missouri.  [Applause.]  Texas  Democrats  be- 
lieve that  Democracy  stands  for  the  right  under  all  circumstances. 
Texas  Democracy  believes  in  the  Ten  Commandments  pronounced  from 
Mount  Sinai,  one  of  which  says,  "Thou  shalt  not  steal."  [Applause.] 
Let  me  ask  you  when  I  mention  the  names  of  candidates  that  you  make 
no  demonstration,  and  I  merely  do  so  because  I  want  to  show  you  the 
exact  facts  in  this  case. 

The  first  ticket  was  the  Wilson-Bryan  ticket.  Senator  Pettigrew,  of 
that  State,  was  at  that  time  in  harmony  with  that  ticket,  but  for  some 
cause  known  only  to  him  he  instituted  an.l  put  into  the  field  another 
ticket,  the  Wilson-Bryan-Clark  ticket.  Why,  when  he  was  fixing  up  a 
ticket,  as  these  gentlemen  stated,  he  should  have  put  Wilson  at  the  head 
of  it,  I  do  not  know  unless  he  was  seeking  to  make  it  still  more 
respectable.  [Applause.]  The  reason  why  Senator  Pettigrew  and  !'is 
friends  in  South  Dakota  wanted  to  fight  that  battle  under  two  flags,  they 
never  revealed  to  us.  What  would  you  think  of  an  army  going  into  battle 
with  the  flafs  of  both 'sides?  Yet  that  is  what  Senator  Pettigrew  did, 
and  you  must  assume  that  he  had  some  purpose  in  doing  so.  That  pur- 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  87 

pose  was  to  get  men  who  really  were  for  Governor  Wilson  to  vote  the 
ticket  for  the  Champ  Clark  delegates. 

But  one  further  fact.  It  is  stated  that  another  ticket  was  put  into 
the  field  headed  "Champ  Clark,"  but  that  they  were  not  aware  of  the 
fact.  Governor  McCorkle  says  it  was  so  charged  by  his  enemies,  but 
the  Governor  knows  that  it  was  proven  in  the  Committee  yesterday  that 
that  ticket  was  headed  by  a  fast  friend  of  Champ  Clark,  and  an  account 
was  published  in  the  newspapers  in  South  Dakota.  Why  did  not  the 
Governor  state  that  to  you?  Because  it  would  have  spoiled  his 
argument. 

There  is  another  fact.  It  was  proven  that  this  man  at  the  head  of 
that  ticket  was  living  in  Senator  Pettigrew  's  home.  Senator  Pettigrew 
recommended  him  as  a  Clark  man,  he  stood  by  him  as  a  Clark  man, 
find  voted  with  him  as  a  Clark  man.  Now,  fellow  Democrats,  that  is 
the  situation.  The  National  Committee,  recognizing  the  fact  that  under 
the  law  the  Wilson-Bryan  ticket  having  received  a  plurality  of  the  votes 
was  entitled  to  be  seated,  gave  to  Governor  Wilson,  though  the  Committee 
was  opposed  to  him,  they  gave  what  they  knew  was  his,  and  seated  his 
delegates  in  the  Convention. 

What  else?  It  is  stated  that  this  new  Clark  delegation  have  a  cer- 
tificate, but  from  whom?  They  have  a  certificate  from  the  Chairman  of 
the  Central  Committee  who  admits  in  writing,  and  his  letter  is  here, 
that  at  the  time  he  gave  the  certificate  he  had  only  partial  returns  from 
16  out  of  62  counties  in  South  Dakota.  The  State  officers — the  Gov- 
•ernor,  the  Attorney  General  and  the  Secretary  of  State — had  all  the 
returns,  and  they,  under  the  great  seal  of  the  State,  gave  to  the  present 
sitting  delegates  their  certificates  that  they  had  received  a  plurality. 

Now,  what  will  you  do?  Will  you  take  the  testimony  of  the  Chairman 
of  the  Democratic  Central  Committee,  who  admits  he  did  not  know 
what  the  facts  were,  or  will  you  take  the  testimony  of  the  sworn  officers, 
Eepublican  though  they  be,  if  the  facts  are  contrary  to  his  statement? 

Fellow  Democrats,  Governor  McCorkle  is  from  my  native  State, 
but  I  am  sorry  to  see  a  West  Virginian  stand  before  a  Democratic 
audience  and  say  that  a  man  is  not  entitled  to  be  believed  because  he 
is  a  Republican.  [Applause.]  Such  statements  would  destroy  any  man's 
intelligence  if  he  sticks  to  them  long  enough.  I  ask  you  to  do  right. 
I  was  struck  with  the  sentence  in  the  prayer  of  the  minister  who  opened 
the  Convention  this  morning  when  he  said  that  "those  morally  wrong 
could  not  be  politically  right."  [Applause.] 

Fellow  Democrats,  I  believe  you  will  do  as  the  National  Committee 
did,  seat  the  delegates  who  come  with  the  seal  of  the  sovereign  State 
and  not  seat  a  lot  of  interlopers  with  a  certificate  only  from  a  Demo- 
cratic Chairman,  who  admits  he  did  not  know  the  facts  to  which  he 
testified  and  who  therefore  testified  to  what  is  not  true.  [Applause.] 

MR.  NEWTON  C.  BLANCHARD,  of  Louisiana:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentle- 
men of  the  Convention,  this  case  ought  to  be  decided  upon  its  merits,  ir- 


88  OFFICIAL  PUOCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

respective  of  the  claims  of  any  aspirant  to  the  {-resiliency,  and  if  it  be 
decided  on  its  merits,  there  is  absolutely  but  one  side  to  this  case. 

The  National  Committee  of  our  party  by  an  almost  unanimous  vnte 
seated  that  delegation  from  South  Dakota  which  is  known  as  the  eon 
testees,  in  whose  behalf  I  appear.  The  Committee  on  Credentials  of  this 
Convention,  by  a  vote  of  28  to  23,  reversed  the  action  of  the  National 
Committee  and  recommended  the  seating  of  the  contestants. 

Now,  what  are  the  facts?  There  is  no  primary  preference  law  in 
South  Dakota,  rs  stated  by  the  ex-Governor  from  West  Virginia.  There 
is  a  primary  law,  however,  and  under  that  law  tickets  may  be  put  out 
under  a  motto  to  be  voted  by  stamping  the  motto.  Under  that  law  three 
tickets  were  put  into  the  field,  one  of  them  known  as  the  Wilson-Bryan 
Progressive  Democracy;  another  the  Wilson-Clark-Bryan  Democracy,  and 
the  other  the  Champ  (lark  Democracy.  Of  those  three  tickets  the  one  to 
which  the  contrstees  belong  received  a  plurality  of  the  vote.  The  other 
t\"ket  to  which  the  contestants  belong  received  some  450  votes  le?s  than 
the  first  named  ticket,  and  the  ticket  under  the  motto  "Champ  Clark 
Democracy"  received  2,700  votes.  Under  the  law  of  South  Dakota,  as  in 
other  States,  a  plurality  \jote  elects,  but  the  Chairman  of  the  Demo- 
cratic Committee  of  South  Dakota,  instead  of  issuing  the  credentials 
\o  that  ticket  which  received  the  majority  or  a  plurality  of  the  votes, 
issued  what  he  claims  to  be  credentials  to  the  members  of  the  other  ticket 
frho  had  received  a  minority  of  the  votes,  and  he  issued  those  creden- 
tials on  the  19th  of  June,  six  days  before  this  Convention  met. 

On  the  20th  of  June,  the  day  after  he  issued  these  credentials  he 
A-rote  a  letter,  which  I  hold  in  hand,  in  which  he  admits  that  he  ha.l 
in  his  possession  the  returns,  and  partial  returns  at  that,  from  only 
16  counties  out  cf  62  counties  in  the  State  of  South  Dakota.  He  admits 
in  this  letter  that  he  had  no  returns  upon  which  to  predicate  his  creden- 
tials issued  to  the  contestants,  but  that  he  issued  to  the  contestants  their 
credentials  because  in  his  opinion  he  believed  they  had  been  elected. 

Now,  gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  the  credentials  upon  which  the 
National  Committee  seated  the  contestees  is  a  certificate  under  the  great 
seal  of  the  State  of  South  Dakota  by  the  Secretary  of  State  that  the  con- 
testees  from  the  full  returrs  in  h:s  hands,  had  received  a  plurality  of 
the  votes  cast  in  South  Dakota  at  that  primary  authorized  by  law.  Under 
the  law  of  South  Dakota  the  Election  Canvassing  Board  consists  of  the- 
Governor,  the  Secretary  of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  the  Auditor  of 
the  State,  and  one  of  the  judges  of  the  Supreme  Court.  That  Can- 
rassing  Beard  considered  the  returns  and  decided  that  the  ticket  to  which 
the  conteetees  belong  ed  had  received  a  plurality  of  the  votes,  and  the 
Secretary  of  State,  under  his  seal,  issued  a  certificate  to  that  effect  to 
the  contestees. 

Now.  gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  a  demand  was  made  by  the  COP- 
festees  upon  the  Chairman  cf  the  Democratic  State  Central  Committee 
to  iss'.ic  them  credentials  based  upon  a  canvass  of  all  the  returns,  and 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  89 

he  refused  to  do  it,  and  instead  issued  what  he  calls  credentials  to  the 
contestants.  This  body,  like  every  other  deliberative  assembly,  is  the 
sole  judge  of  the  election  and  qualifications  of  its  members,  and  in  the 
exercise  of  that  authority  your  National  Committee  held  the  credentials 
held  by  the  eontestees;  presented  after  a  full  canvass  of  the  vote,  to  be 
such  credentials  as  this  Convention  should  recognize. 

It  was  asked  in  the  Committee  on  Credentials  why  it  was  that  they 
did  not  institute  mandamus  proceedings  to  compel  the  Chairman  of  the 
Committee  to  issue  them  credentials.  The  answer  was  that  these  cre- 
dentials were  issued  by  the  Chairman  of  the  State  Committee  only  five 
days  before  this  Convention  was  to  meet,  and  there  was  not  time  to 
begin  court  proceedings  and  bring  them  to  a  decision  before  this  Con- 
vention met.  That  is  the  answer  to  that. 

Now,  gentlemen,  there  is  no  question  that  these  three  tickets  were  all 
lawful  tickets  under  the  law  of  South  Dakota.  It  was  admitted  in  the 
Credentials  Committee  by  the  lawyer  who  represented  the  contestant*,  a 
lawyer  from  Nebraska,  that  the  ticket  he  represented,  the  contestants, 
received  a  minority  of  the  votes  cast  in  that  primary.  That  was  the 
admission  he  made  and  he  planted  himself  in  his  demand  for  recognition 
of  the  claims  of  the  contestants  purely  upon  this  set  of  credentials  :s&lt;ned 
by  the  Chairman  of  the  State  Committee,  and  here  [exhibiting]  is  a 
letter  from  that  Chairman  in  which  he  admits  that  when  he  issued  those 
credentials  he  did  not  have  the  canvass  of  the  votes  before  him. 

Now,  on  the  strength  of  that  admission,  Mr.  Chairman,  is  it  possible 
that  this  Democratic  Convention  is  going  to  seat  a  set  of  delegates 
who  come  here  with  a  minority  report  and  present  credentials  that  the 
Chairman  admits  he  issued  without  having  a  canvass  of  the  votes 
before  him?  I  think  not. 

I  close,  as  I  commenced,  with  an  appeal  to  the  Convention  to  do  the 
right  thing  and  decide  this  case  on  its  merits,  without  regard  to  partisan 
feeling.  [Applause.] 

MB.  BELL,  of  Indiana :  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the  Conven- 
tion, this  same  letter  from  the  Chairman  of  the  Democratic  organization 
of  South  Dakota,  upon  which  they  seem  to  place  so  much  stress  for  their 
case,  states  that  of  the  votes  cast  for  the  delegates  here  the  Champ  Clark 
delegates  received  65  j  er  cent,  while  the  Wilson  delegates  received  but 
35  per  cent.  The  letter  is  as  follows: 

"Your  letter  received,  and  in  reply  will  say  that  I  have  received 
official  returns  to  date  from  only  16  County  Auditors,  and  most  of  these 
returns  are  incomplete  in  that  the  report  fails  to  give  the  vote  of  each 
delegate ;  and  in  view  of  the  fact  that  Champ  Clark  has  carried  the  State 
by  nearly  3,000  votes,  in  other  words,  getting  65  per  cent  of  the  Demo- 
cratic vote  polled  at  the  primary,  whereas  Woodrow  Wilson  has  received 
only  35  per  cent  of  the  vote.  I  am  of  the  present  opinion,  having  no 
returns  upon  which  I  could  issuo  certificates,  that  the  delegation  headed 
by  Andrew  E.  Lee  ought  to  be  seated  in  the  National  Convention." 


90  -  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Now,  as  to  the  three  tickets  that  were  in  the  field.  The  third  ticket 
was  placed  in  the  field  and  headed  "Champ  Clark"  ticket.  When  those 
who  were  interested  in  the  candidacy  of  Mr.  Clark  attempted  to  •with- 
draw the  ticket,  the  Secretary  of  State  held  that  they  must  get  a  petition 
from  every  man  upon  that  ticket.  When  they  sought  to  do  that  they 
found  that  the  ticket  contained  the  names  of  three  men  who  wore  ur, 
known  in  the  State  of  South  Dakota.  These  three  names  had  been 
put  upon  the  ticket  as  a  trick  to  prevent  its  being  withdrawn,  so  that 
at  the  primary  when  the  vote  came  to  be  cast  the  voters  who  believed  in 
Clark's  candidacy  would  be  deceived.  By  that  means  the  head  of  the 
Wilson  ticket  received  a  slight  plurality  of  the  votes  cast  in  South 
Dakota. 

I  want  to  make  this  one  point.  Those  who  believed  in  Wilson  as  the 
candidate  cast  4,700  and  thoee  who  believed  in  Champ  Clark  as  the 
candidate  cast  7,000  votes.  [Applause.]  The  only  certificate  authorized 
to  be  issued  under  the  primary  election  law  of  South  Dakota  should  have 
come  from  the  Chairman  of  the  State  Committee.  The  delegates  wlio 
have  been  seated  by  the  Committee  on  Credentials  bring  to  you  a  certifi- 
cate, their  credentials  issued  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  and 
Secretary  of  State.  The  delegates  represented  by  the  minority  report 
bring  to  you  a  certificate  issued  by  a  Kepublican  Returning  Board  in 
the  State  of  South  Dakota.  This  Committee  in  deciding  to  seat  the 
delegates  who  are  represented  by  the  majority  report  did  so  because 
they  believed  that  a  fraud  had  been  perpetrated  in  putting  this  thirl 
ticket  in  the  field  and  that  the  contestants  brought  before  that  Committee 
the  only  credential  which  was  entitled  to  recognition  here.  And  because 
of  the  fact  that  those  who  favored  the  candidacy  of  Champ  Clark  re- 
ceived nearly  3,000  majority,  we  decided  to  seat  that  delegation. 

MR.  T.  J.  KNOX,  of  Minnesota:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  as  a 
member  of  the  Committee  on  Credentials,  I  felt  that  I  must  say  a  word 
or  two  with  reference  to  this  South  Dakota  contest.  This  question  should 
be  a  judicial  one.  It  should  not  be  decided  because  any  delegate  is  in 
favor  of  any  particular  man  r.s  a  candidate  for  President.  It  should  be 
"decided  upon  its  merits  and,  as  I  say,  it  should  be  treated  as  a  judicial 
question. 

Under  the  law  of  South  Dakota,  delegates  to  a  Convention  of  this 
kind  are  elected  at  a  primary,  and  under  their  law  each  set  of  delegates 
select  a  heading  or  motto  under  which  they  stand  for  election.  In  this 
case  there  was  first  presented  a  set  of  delegates  under  the  motto  of  "  Wil- 
son-Bryan Progressive  Democracy. ' '  Later  there  was  presented  a  set  of 
delegates  under  the  title  " \Vilson-Clark-Bryan  Democracy."  Later  an- 
other ticket  was  presented  under  the  heading  "Champ  Clark  Democ- 
racy. ' ' 

Those  three  tickets  were  before  the  people  of  that  State  for  their 
action,  for  them  to  vote  upon.  The  first  ticket  which  was  headed  "Wil- 
son-Bryan Democracy"  received  400  odd  votes  more  than  either  of  the 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  (J1 

others.  [Applause.]  Each  of  those  tickets  had  a  separate  set  of  dele- 
gates. The  second  ticket  was  headed  the  Wilson-Clark-Bryan  Democracy. 
Now,  these  men  come  here  claiming  that  these  delegates  were  elected 
by  fraud.  I  ask  you,  gentlemen,  if  there  was  fraud,  who  committed 
that  fraud?  They  say  that  that  ticket  which  was  presented  to  the  people 
of  that  State  under  the  head  of  Wilson-Clark-Bryan  Democracy  was  a 
t'hirk  ticket.  They  had  a  Clark  ticket;  why  did.  they  put  the  name  of 
Wilson  on  it? 

Now,  gentlemen,  this  first  ticket  received  400  votes  more  than  the 
second  ticket,  and  I  ask  you,  gentlemen,  if  you  are  going  to  sustain 
the  primary  law  of  South  Dakota  or  are  you  going  to  override  it  by 
muscle  and  rorce.  Gentlemen,  Democrats  should  be  willing  to  give  jus- 
tice; they  should  be  willing  to  act  fairly  and  judicially  upon  a  question 
of  this  kind,  and  if  you  do  so  there  can  be  no  question  that  the  men 
who  received  the  largest  primary  vote  in  South  Dakota  are  the  honest 
delegates  to  this  Convention.  [Applause.] 

MR.  THEODORE  A.  BELL,  of  California:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
of  the  Convention,  the  members  of  the  Committee  on  Credentials  repre- 
senting the  majority  of  that  Committee,  have  asked  me  to  consume  five  to 
eight  minutes  in  closing  this  debate. 

If  I  am  any  judge  of  the  spirit  that  pervades  this  Convention,  you  in- 
tend to  lay  down  in  no  uncertain  terms  the  principle  that  when  the 
people  of  a  State,  whether  it  be  South  Dakota,  California,  or  Nebraska, 
have  expressed  their  choice  for  President,  the  men  who  come  to  this 
Convention  must  here  vote  the  will  of  the  people  of  that  State. 
[Applause.] 

We  are  informed,  by  the  facts  that  were  presented  to  the  Committee 
on  Credentials,  that  a  fictitious  ticket,  was  put  up  in  South  Dakota,  for 
the  avowed  purpose  of  defeating  Champ  Clark  in  the  preferential  pri- 
mary vote  of  that  State.  Under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  South  Dakota 
that  ticket  could  not  be  withdrawn.  Champ  Clark  repudiated  it,  but 
unless  all  ten  men  whose  nan:es  were  on  that  ticket  joined  in  the  request 
to  withdraw  it,  the  Secretary  of  State  would  not  permit  it  to  be  with- 
drawn. Three  of  those  ten  men  never  existed.  They  were  John  Does, 
put  on  there  by  the  Wilson  men  of  South  Dakota.  [Applause  and  ex- 
pressions of  dissent.] 

There  is  one  thing  certain.  Not  even  those  who  champion  the 
minority  report  will  deny  the  fact  that  in  that  campaign  in  South  Dakota 
Wilson  received  4,600  votes,  and  7,000  stalwart  Democrats  of  that  State 
voted  for  Champ  ('lark.  [Applause.] 

MR.  EARL  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  Will  the  gentleman  yield  for  a 
question? 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  In  just  one  moment. 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  Did  the  people  of  South  Dakota  have  a 
Democratic  primary  election? 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  They  did. 


92  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  BREWER:  Who  got  the  majority  of  the  Democratic  votes  in  the 
Democratic  primary  before  the  people? 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  Champ  Clark,  the  Speaker  of  the  Hopsc 
of  Representatives.  [Applause.] 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  Then  do  I  understand  that  it  is  the  in- 
tention to  take  delegates  from  the  man  who  carried  them  before  the 
people,  and  deliver  them  to  the  other  fellow? 

MR.  LUKE  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  I  will  say  to  Governor  Brewer  that  the 
sitting  delegates  got  4,600  votes  and  the  others  4,200  votes. 

MR.  NEWTON  C.  BLANCHARD,  of  Louisiana:  Mr.  Chairman,  will  the 
gentleman  yield?  I  wish  to  ask  him  a  question. 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  I  yield  now  for  a  question  to  be  submitted 
by  Governor  Blanchard. 

MR.  BLANCHARD,  of  Louisiana:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  the  question  I  wish  to  ask  the  gentleman  from  California  is 
this :  Two  of  those  tickets  bore  the  motto  ' '  Wilson-Bryan  Progressive 
Democracy. ' '  The  other  bore  the  legend  ' '  Wilson-Bryan-Clark. ' ' 

MR.  BELL,  of  California :  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the  Con- 
vention, everybody  desires  to  obtain  the  exact  facts,  and  I  want  to  read 
to  you  the  figures.  One  of  the  gentlemen  supporting  the  minority 
report  has  asked  me  to  submit  for  him  the  exact  figures  of  that  vote. 
This  request  comes  from  the  minority.  The  number  of  votes  cast  for 
ticket  No.  1  was  4,670 ;  for  ticket  No.  2,  4,230,  and  for  ticket  No.  3,  the 
Champ  Clark  ticket,  2,700.  Now,  the  men  who  received  the  4,670  votes 
proclaimed  themselves  the  simon  pure  Wilson  men  of  that  State.  The 
men  who  received  4,230  votes  went  upon  the  rostrum  and  in  the  news 
papers  and  proclaimed  themselves  the  simon  pure  Champ  Clark  Demo 
crats.  Three  of  the  names  that  were  put  upon  the  third  Champ  Clark 
ticket  that  received  2,700  votes  were  names  of  men  who  never  existed. 
It  was  impossible  to  withdraw  that  ticket. 

The  lines  were  squarely  drawn.  The  people  did  not  look  at  the 
mottoes  at  the  head  of  the  three  tickets,  but  they  looked  to  the  men. 
Now,  this  was  the  exact  situation.  The  name  of  Wilson  a,nd  the  name  of 
Clark  appeared  upon  the  first  two  tickets.  It  was  necessary  in  that 
contest  in  that  State  for  the  delegates  themselves  to  declare  which  of 
those  two  men  at  the  head  of  those  two  tickets  they  stood  for.  One  group 
of  these  candidates  went  out  and  said,  ' '  We  stand  for  Wilson, ' '  and  the 
second  group  went  out  and  said,  "We  stand  for  Clark."  The  first 
group,  that  proclaimed  itself  for  WTiIson,  received  4,670  votes. 

Let  me  conclude  this  statement,  and  I  am  through.  I  will  yield  then 
to  other  gentlemen  who  dissent  from  my  opinion.  I  want  the  men  who 
must  vote  and  vote  conscientiously  to  hear  these  figures.  The  totals 
were:  Wilson,  4,670;  Clark,  4,230,  and  on  the  third  ticket,  Clark,  2,700; 
and  that  man  Clark,  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  who 
has  unified  his  party,  is  entitled  to  the  ten  votes  from  that  State. 
[Applause.]

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  is  now  on  the  adoption  of 
the  report  as  amended. 

MR,  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  Before  the  question  is 
put  to  the  Convention,  I  wish  to  make  a  point  of  order. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Mississippi  raises 
a  point  of  order  which  he  will  state. 

MR.  WILIIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  The  point  of  order  I  desire  to  make  is 
to  so  much  of  the  report  of  the  Committee  on  Credentials  as  affects  the 
delegation  from  the  Philippine  Islands.  I  make  the  point  of  order  that 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION        95 

the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  having  decided  that  the  Philip- 
pine Islands  are  not  a  part  of  the  United  States,  but  are  a  mere  appendage 
of  the  United  States,  they  cannot  be  represented  in  a  Democratic  Conven- 
tion which  is  called  for  the  purpose  of  selecting  an  Executive  who  is 
a  part  of  the  governing  power  of  the  United  States. 

I  respectfully  call  the  attention  of  the  Chair  to  the  precedent  in  the 
previous  Democratic  Conventions  at  St.  Louis  and  at  Denver  upon  that 
question.  The  point  of  order  is  that  not  being  a  part  of  the  United 
States,  they  should  have  no  part  in  the  selecting  of  the  President  of  the 
United  States,  at  a  general  election  or  in  either  one  of  the  National 
Conventions.  I  shall  not  argue  that  any  further.  I  am  aware  of  the 
fact  that  the  Chair  is  perfectly  acquainted  with  the  previous  rulings  upon 
this  question. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN  :  The  point  of  order  presented  by  Senator 
Williams  is  that  the  Philippine  Islands  being  no  part  of  the  territory  ut 
the  United  States,  under  a  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United 
States,  are  not  entitled  to  a  voice  in  the  nomination  or  the  election 
of  a  President  of  the  United  States. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  I  make  the  point  of  order  against 
the  point  of  order  made  by  the  gentleman  from  Mississippi  that  his  point 
comes  too  late;  that  under  the  rules  of  the  House  of  Eepresentatives, 
under  which  we  are  now  operating,  he  cannot  submit  a  point  of  order 
after  the  Convention  has  entered  upon  debate  upon  the  question  of  the 
adoption  of  the  Committee's  report;  and  the  previous  question  having 
been  already  called  for,  it  is  the  only  thing  before  the  Convention,  and 
his  point,  of  order  cannot  be  sustained. 

.  MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  gentleman  from 
Pennsylvania  has  misunderstood  the  situation.  We  are  working  under 
the  rules  of  the  House  of  Kepresentatives,  but  whenever  a  report  from 
the  Committee  of  the  whole  House  is  presented,  it  is  the  duty  of  the 
Speaker  to  submit  the  question  ''Is  a  separate  vote  demanded  upon  any 
part  of  the  report!"  Just  a  moment  ago  a  point  of  order  was  made 
while  I  demanded  a  separate  vote  on  this  particular  question.  Under 
every  rule  of  the  House  of  Representatives  you  are  entitled  to  call  for  a 
separate  vote,  and  while  you  are  calling  for  a  separate  vote  you  have  n 
right,  as  a  precedent  to  thai:,  to  make  a  point  of  order,  and  the  point 
of  order  I  make  now  is  prei-edent  to  the  right  to  demand  a  separate  vote. 

One  word  more.  Gentlemen,  this  is  a  very  much  more  important 
question  thai,  you  may  think  at  first.  I  do  not  care  about  the  votes 
of  the  Philippine  delegates.  I  do  not  even  know  for  whom  they  are 
going  to  vote.  It  has  just  been  suggested  to  me  that  they  would  vote 
for  the  man  I  want.  That  makes  no  difference  to  me.  The  Democratic 
party  cannot  stultify  itself  by  standing  in  a  National  Convention  and 
denying  the  right  of  the  Tinted  States  to  colonially  exploit  the  Philip- 
pines, while  they  are  not  a  part  of  the  United  States,  either  actually  or 
with  any  hope  of  ever  becoming  a  real  part  of  them,  and  at  the  same 


96  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

time  seat  a  Philippine  delegation  upon  the  floor,  to  determine  what  the 
United  States  shall  do  about  any  great  public  question. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  rules  that  the  point  of*  on  lor 
made  by  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr.  Palmer]  is  well  taken, 
but  the  Senator  from  Mississippi  [Mr.  Williams]  demanded  in  connection 
with  his  point  of  order  that  a  separate  vote  be  taken  on  the  Philippine 
proposition,  and  he  is  entitled  to  that  vote. 

MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  I  move  now  that  the  report  of  the 
Credentials  Committee  be  accepted  with  this  amendment,  that  the  Philip- 
pine Islands  are  not  entitled  to  delegates  upon  the  floor. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  I  make  the  point  of  order  against  the 
•notion  of  the  Senator  from  Mississippi,  that  the  previous  question  having 
been  ordered,  no  amendment  can  now  be  offered;  and  I  submit,  Mr. 
Chairman,  that  the  proper  practice  is  to  submit  to  the  Convention  the 
entire  roll  as  reported  by  the  Committee  on  Credentials,  with  the  excep- 
tion of  the  names  appearing  on  the  roll  from  the  Philippine  Islands,  and 
after  that  has  been  disposed  of  a  separate  vote  may  be  taken  upon 
lie  question  whether  they  shall  occupy  seats  in  this  Convention. 

MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  I  agree  with  the  course  suggested 
by  the  delegate  from  Pennsylvania.  That  is  the  correct  course,  and  it 
•should  be  announced  to  the  Convention. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  is,  shall  the  report  as  here- 
tofore amended  be  adopted,  with  the  exception  of  the  persons  named 
therein  as  the  delegates  from  the  Philippines? 

The  Action  was  agreed  to. 

THE  TEMPORARY  C'HAIRMAN:  The  question  now  is  on  that  part  of  the 
report  which  awards  seats  to  the  representatives  from  the  Philippines. 
The  Chair  will  state  in  this  connection  that  this  question  was  presented 
to  the  Democratic  Convention  in  the  year  1904  when  Hon.  John  Sharp 
Williams  was  presiding  as  Temporary  Chairman.  A  report  was  made 
by  the  Committee  on  Credentials  awarding  seats  to  the  delegates  from 
the  Philippines,  and  a  point  of  order  being  raised,  he  held,  presenting  his 
reasons  at  some  considerable  length  and  with  great  clearness,  that  the 
Philippines  were  not  entitled  to  representation  in  a  Democratic  National 
Convention,  because  the  Philippines  are  not  a  part  of  the  territory  of  the 
United  States,  under  a  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court. 

All  those  in  favor  of  seating  the  delegates  from  the  Philippines  in 
this  Convention  will  say  "Aye";  all  those  opposed  to  seating  the  dele- 
gates from  the  Philippines  in  this  Convention  will  say  "No."  The 
"noes"  seem  to  have  it. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  A  division,  Mr.  Chair- 
man. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  A  division  is  called  for. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  I  withdraw  the  demand  for  a  division. 

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIRMAN:  The  "noes"  have  it,  and  the  delegates 
from  the  Philippines  are  excluded  from  seats  in  the  Convention.

THE  TEMPORARY  CHAIBMAN:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  want 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  121 

to  thank  you  for  your  courtesy,  your  patience  and  your  uniform  kindness 
during  the  hours  I  have  presided  over  this  Convention.     [Applause.] 

I  now  enjoy  the  greatest  privilege  of  all  that,  perhaps,  has  come  to 
me  during  the  Chairmanship  of  this  Convention,  that  of  introducing  to 
you  one  of  the  most  distinguished  leaders  of  the  American  Democracy, 
the  Hon.  Ollie  M.  James,  of  Kentucky.  [Applause.] 

ADDRESS   OF  THE   PERMANENT    CHAIRMAN. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  (Mr.  Ollie  M.  James,  of  Kentucky) : 
Fellow  Democrats,  words  are  inadequate  for  me  to  properly  express  the 
high  appreciation  of  this  great  honor  you  have  conferred  upon  me,  that 
of  presiding  over  a  Convention  not  only  to  nominate  the  candidate  of 
the  Democracy  of  the  United  States  for  President,  but  to  name  the  next 
President  of  this  great  Republic.  [Cheers.]  I  know  that  I  shall  but 
bespeak  your  sentiment  when  I  say  that  the  Democracy  of  the  nation  and 
this  Convention  extend  to  that  distinguished  Democrat,  Judge  Parker, 
their  high  appreciation  of  the  fair  and  impartial  manner  in  which  he  has 
presided  over  this  Convention.  [Applause.] 

I  rejoice  with  you,  my  fellow  Democrats,  in  the  hope  of  victory.  It 
has  been  a  hard  fight  for  our  party.  It  has  been  a  long  night,  with 
but  few  stars,  but  now,  thank  God,  the  sun  bursts  over  a  thousand  hills, 
spreading  victory  everywhere.  [Applause  and  cheers.] 

I  congratulate  the  Democrats  of  the  nation  upon  the  fortunate 
auspices  under  which  we  have  assembled.  Here  no  charge  of  bribery 
hovers  above  this  hall,  no  cry  of  thief  and  robber  is  hurled  by  one  fellow 
Democrat  at  another.  No  soldiers  stand  in  reserve  to  keep  us  from 
each  others  throats.  Our  deliberations  here  shall  be  for  the  country's 
good,  tolerant  of  each  other's  views,  believing,  as  I  do,  that  when  the 
nominees  are  named  by  this  Convention  they  will  have  back  of  them 
every  loyal  Democrat  in  the  Republic,  as  well  as  the  hearty  support  of 
progressives  everywhere.  The  Democratic  party  is  essentially  a  party 
of  the  people,  because  it  is  the  people.  It  has  fought  a  hard  battle,  when 
it  seemed  that  night  would  never  end  and  that  day  would  never  dawn; 
but  the  battle  in  the  interest  of  the  rights  of  the  people  they  have  con- 
tinued to  make  until  we  see  the  common  enemy,  the  once  great  Repub- 
lii'an  party,  divided,  distracted  and  torn  asunder,  while  Democracy  is 
united,  harmonious  and  militant.  [Applause.] 

There  are  two  records  that  will  be  presented  to  the  American  people 
in  the  coming  campaign  for  their  consideration.  One  is  the  record  of 
the  Republican  party  with  promises  betrayed,  arrogantly,  defiantly  be 
trayed,  and  the  other  is  the  record  of  the  Democratic  party  of  promises 
faithfully  and  honestly  kept.  [Applause.]  The  Republican  party  itself 
recognizing  that  President  Taft  has  been  unfaithful  to  the  great  mass 
of  Americans,  refused  by  an  honest  majority  of  the  Convention  to  re- 
nominate  him,  :uid  it  was  only  brought  about  by  the  most  wholesale, 


122  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

conscienceless  and  deliberate  unseating  of  delegates  honestly  elected 
that  was  ever  perpetrated  in  American  politics.  The  Kepublican  party, 
flushed  with  many  victories,  imperious  as  a  tyrant,  unheeding  the  Je- 
mands  of  the  people,  took  the  reins  of  the  government  in  1908  under  the 
solemn  promise  that  they  would  revise  the  tariff  in  the  interest  of  the 
consumer.  Instead  of  keeping  this  promise  as  they  should  have  done, 
because  it  was  their  bond  of  honor,  they  betrayed  it.  They  raised  the 
tariff  higher  than  ever  before  until  it  reached  its  maximum  of  protection, 
being  47  per  cent. 

-  The  story  of  this  base  betrayal  is  known  to  all  men.  The  Democratic 
party  appealed  to  the  American  people  on  their  record  in  the  Sixty-First 
Congress  upon  the  Payne-Aldrich  Tariff  Bill,  and  received  from  them  a 
verdict  of  guilty  against  the  Republican  party  and  the  bestowal  of  power 
upon  ourselves.  How  faithfully  we  have  kept  our  promises  to  the  people 
is  but  a  resume  of  our  official  action.  [Applause.]  Having  control  of 
but  one  branch  of  the  law-making  power,  the  House  of  Representatives, 
we  undertook  to  reform  the  tariff  in  the  interest  of  the  consuming  pub- 
lic, believing  as  we  do  that  it  is  a  tax  that  is  pkid  by  the  consumer 
most  generally  to  the  trust  or  monopoly  that  is  sheltered  by  it,  sometimes 
to  the  Government;  believing  as  we  do  that  the  right  of  taxation  is  a 
Governmental  right,  that  it  cannot  be  delegated  to  individuals,  trusts, 
corporations  or  monopolies;  believing  as  we  do  that  the  right  to  levy  a 
tariff  exists  only  for  the  purpose  of  running  the  Government  economic- 
ally and  efficiently  administered,  we  presented  the  tariff  question  to  the 
people  in  segregated  form. 

First,  we  reduced  the  tariff  upon  woolen  clothes  40  per  cent.  This 
was  the  one  schedule  that  President  Taft  himself  had  said  was  too  high, 
that  it  was  only  made  possible  by  reason  of  the  strength  of  the  wool 
trust  in  the  East  and  the  wool  growers  in  the  West;  but  he  could  not 
veto  it  because  he  would  have  to  veto  all  the  other  fourteen  schedules  of 
the  Tariff  Bill.  This  bill  went  to  the  Senate;  and  though  it  was  con- 
trolled by  the  opposition  party,  we  found  sufficient  assistance  from  the 
ranks  of  our  opponents  to  pass  it  up  to  the  President.  The  President 
returned  it  to  the  Congress  of  the  United  States  with  his  veto,  and 
assigned  as  his  reason  that  he  had  no  Tariff  Board  report,  and  was 
therefore  uninformed  upon  the  question,  and  for  this  reason  returned  it 
with'  his  disapproval. 

We  undertook  to  pass  this  bill  over  his  veto.  Our  Federal  Constitu- 
tion requires  two-thirds  to  accomplish  this.  ,  We  had  more  than  one  hun- 
dred majority  in  favor  of  the  passage  of  the  bill,  his  veto  to  the  con- 
trary notwithstanding.  We  lacked  only  eleven  votes  of  having  the  neces- 
sary two-thirds  to  pass  it  through  the  House  of  Representatives  over  the 
President 's  veto.  And  today  the  Wool  Trust  stands  entrenched  not  be- 
hind a  majority  of  the  lawmakers  of  the  Republic,  but  behind  the  veto 
of  the  President  and  the  eleven  more  than  one-third  of  the  Representa- 
tives of  the  American  people,  picking  the  pockets  of  the  shivering  poor 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  123 

and  ragged  people  of  America.     [Applause.]     The  Eepublican  party  be-   / 
came  so  arrogant,  and  so  confident  that  this  character  of  robbery  would  \ 
continue  to  meet   the   favor  of  the  American   people,   that  they  boldly  / 
wrote  into  their  platform  of  1908  a  declaration  that  the  tariff  should  : 
not  only  equal  the   difference   in   the   cost  of  production   at   home   and   • 
abroad,  but  should  be  high  enough  in  addition  to  this  to  give  a  profit  to  I 
the  manufacturer  here.     In  all  the  history  of  the  civilized  governments 
no  party  ever  became  so  defiant  of  the  public  will,  or  went  so  far  as  to 
say  that  all  the  rest  of  the  people  should  be  taxed  and  from  their  pockets 
taken  a  sufficient  amount  to  give  a  profit  to  another  class  of  people. 
They  offered  no  profit  to  the  farmer,  though  the  drought  might  come  and 
storms  destroy  and  failure  meet  his  efforts.     The  laborer  was  offered  no 
profit.     He  might  toil  from  early  morn  to  late  at  night,  and  sleep  in  a 
humble  tenement.     He  was  guaranteed  no  profit  by  the  Eepublican  plat- 
form.    The  only  class  of  our  millions  of  Americans  who  were  considered 
so  peculiarly  the  favorites  of  the  Eepublican  party  as  to  warrant  them 
in  declaring  that   the  taxing  power  of  the  Government   could  be   used 
to  take  from  the  pockets  of  men  in  other  pursuits  of  life  money  suffi- 
cient to  give  a  profit  to  their  special  favorites,  the  manufacturers.     Nor 
were  the  American  people  taken  into  the  confidence  of  the  Eepublican 
party  as  to  how  great  this  profit  might  be,  or  how  much  watered  stock  it 
was  to  be  paid  upon  or  how  inflated. 

The  tax  upon  woolen  goods  is  the  most  indefensible  of  all  taxes  laid 
upon  the  American  consumer.     It  is  a  tax  collected  at  the  drugstore,  and    ; 
by  the  undertaking  establishments.     The  wool   bill  was  passed  by  the    j 
Democratic  House,  and  vetoed  by  the  President,  which  would  have  saved 
to  the  consuming  Americans  upon  the  price  of  their  clothing  two  hundred 
millions   of   dollars   per   annum,  but  the   Wool   Trust   cried   out   to   the 
President,  and  he  unloosed  the  clutch  that  we  had  upon  the  throat  of  the 
wool  monopoly  by  vetoing  this  bill,  and  returning  it  to  Congress.    When 
the  veto  of  the  Wool  Bill  was  being  considered,  four  members  of  the  • 
President's  Cabinet,  for  the  first  time  in  a  service  of  ten  years  that 
I  have  been  there,  appeared  upon  the  floor  as  a  mighty  lobby  with  the 
patronage  club  in  one  hand  and  promises  in  the  other  to  sustain  the 
President's  veto  upon  this  bill. 

The  Democratic  party  next  passed  a  farmer's  and  laborer's  free  list 
bill,  giving  free  untaxed  meat  and  bread  to  hungry  mouths,  giving  free 
farming  implements  to  the  tillers  of  the  American  soil,  offering  free 
lumber  to  the  homeless  of  the  Republic.  This  bill  was  so  just  that  it 
found  its  way  through  the  Senate,  controlled  by  the  opposition,  and  was 
passed  on  to  the  President.  '  Notwithstanding  the  cost  of  living  had  in- 
creased more  than  100  per  cent  in  the  last  few  years  and  the  working- 
man  's  wages  had  stood  still ;  notwithstanding  non-meat-eating  clubs  were 
being  formed  in  various  cities  of  the  United  States  by  men,  women  and 
children  denying  themselves  the  food  they  desired  and  needed,  as  a  pro- 
test against  the  Beef  Trust;  notwithstanding  the  Harvester  Trust  was 


124  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

reaching  its  hands  into  the  pockets  of  every  farmer  in  America;  not- 
withstanding the  Lumber  Trust  was  denying  to  millions  of  Americans  the 
right  to  build  homes  that  they  could  call  their  own,  the  President  vetoed 
the  bill  and  returned  it  to  the  Congress  of  the  United  States.  We  under- 
took to  pass  it  over  the  President 's  veto.  We  lacked  less  than  a  dozen 
votes  of  the  sufficient  number,  and  today  the  Harvester  Trust,  the  Lum- 
ber Trust,  the  Beef  Trust,  all  stand  hidden  behind  President  Taft  and 
a  dozen  more  than  one-third  of  the  American  representatives  in  Congress, 
looting  the  pockets  of  the  American  consumers.  President  Taft  has  the 
lone  and  singular  distinction  of  being  the  only  President  in  the  life  of 
this  Eepublic  who  ever  vetoed  bills  cheapening  clothing  to  the  people, 
lumber  to  the  homeless,  and  meat  and  bread  to  hungry  Americans  and 
free  farming  implements  to  the  toiling  farmer.  This  bill  would  have 
saved  to  the  consuming  public  three  hundred  and  fifty  millions  a  year. 
[Applause.] 

The  next  bill  we  passed  was  the  one  reducing  the  tariff  on  cotton 
goods,  which  would  have  saved  many  million  dollars  to  our  people.  This 
too  met  with  the  veto  of  the  President.  Then  we  offered  to  the  American 
people  a  bill  taking  the  tax  off  sugar,  giving  to  them  free  sugar  and 
placing  an  excise  tax  on  all  incomes  in  excess  of  five  thousand  dollars. 
This  bill  is  now  in  the  Senate  of  the  United  States  unacted  upon. 

I  believe  in  free  sugar.  It  will  save  every  householder  in  this  country 
two  cents  upon  every  pound  of  sugar.  I  believe  in  a  tax  upon  incomes; 
I  believe  in  an  excise  tax,  and  I  deny  that  the  people  who  are  well-to-do, 
those  who  are  rich,  those  who  are  so  fortunate  as  to  have  their  thousands 
pouring  in  every  year,  are  unwilling  to  bear  their  part  of  the  burden  of 
taxation  to  sustain  this  mighty  Government  of  ours.  [Applause.] 

The  platform  adopted  by  one  branch  of  the  Eepublican  party  at 
Chicago  endorses  the  vetoes  of  President  Taft,  yet  at  the  same  time 
they  had  to  censure  and  condemn  the  record  of  from  30  to  100  Re- 
publicans in  the  House  of  Representatives  who  supported  us  in  favor 
of  the  passage  of  these  bills.  The  American  people  are  told  in  the  tariff 
plank  recently  adopted  in  Chicago  that  they  want  a  report  from  the 
Tariff  Board  before  any  legislation  is  attempted.  This  is  a  motion  for 
continuance  from  a  guilty  client,  made  by  an  expert  criminal  lawyer. 
[Applause.]  Its  sole  purpose  is  delay.  They  want  to  take  the  power 
lodged  by  the  Federal  Constitution  in  the  hands  of  the  people's  repre- 
sentatives away  from  them  and  place  it  in  the  hands  of  a  Tariff  Board 
appointed  by  the  President  of  the  United  States — whom  he  can  dismiss 
at  will.  And  upon  the  report  of  this  Board  the  American  people  must 
depend  for  relief.  Nothing  was  said  about  a  Tariff  Board  report  when  the 
McKinley  Bill  was  passed.  A  Tariff  Board  report  was  not  thought 
necessary  when  the  Dingley  Bill  was  passed.  We  heard  nothing  from 
the  Republican  party  in  favor  of  a  Tariff  Board  report  when  the  Payne- 
Aldrich  Tariff  Bill  was  hurried  through  Congress,  amid  the  cheers  of 
every  trust  and  monopoly  in  the  land.  When  does  a  demand  for  the 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  125 

report  of  a  Tariff  Board  come  to  our  ears?  It  is  when  the  tariff 
has  already  been  fixed  so  high  that  they  know  they  can  get  it  no  higher, 
and  if  the  people's  representatives  were  allowed  to  'speak,  they  would 
reduce  it.  Then  we  are  told  the  Tariff  Board  must  report;  this  great 
right  of  taxation  must  be  taken  out  of  the  hands  of  the  people  and 
lodged  in  the  hands  of  a  Board  of  five  men,  and  their  report  must  be 
awaited  by  the  suffering  people  of  the  United  States. 

I  believe  in  the  rule  of  the  people.  I  do  not  fear  them.  From  their 
ranks  has  come  every  army  that  has  fought  for  liberty  in  the  history 
of  the  world.  I  am  a  progressive  Democrat.  In  this  age  the  people 
command  and  the  leaders  must  obey.  [Applause.] 

We  passed  through  the  House  of  Representatives  a  resolution  sub- 
mitting an  amendment  to  the  Federal  Constitution,  providing  for  the 
election  of  United  States  Senators  by  direct  vote  of  the  people.  This 
was  in  obedience  to  our  promise  in  a  former  Democratic  National  plat- 
form. The  Senate  of  the  United  States  had  become  the  rock  against 
which  remedial  legislation  in  the  interest  of  the  people  has  been  wrecked. 
Wealth  has  made  that  body  its  last  stand,  privilege  was  making  it  its 
rendezvous.  We  believed  that  the  people  ought  to  have  the  right  to 
select  their  Senators  directly  as  they  do  their  members  of  Congress.  And 
today  the  American  people  have  before  them  this  amendment  to  the 
Federal  Constitution  by  reason  of  the  courage,  advocacy  and  support  of 
Democracy.  [Applause.]  I  believe  the  day  is  not  distant  when  the 
Senate  will  be  free  and  as  responsive  to  the  will  of  the  people  as  the 
House  of  Representatives. 

We  then  passed  through  Congress  a  bill  providing  for  publicity  of 
campaign  funds  before,  as  well  as  after,  election.  This  measure  is  now 
law,  and  both  election  of  Senators  by  the  people  and  publicity  of 
ciiinpaign  funds  met  the  disapproval  of  the  Republican  Convention  held 
in  1908  by  more  than  800  majority.  We  submitted  to  the  country  an 
amendment  to  the  Federal  Constitution  providing  for  an  income  lax. 
We  know  that  a  hundred  billions  of  our  one  hundred  and  thirty  billions  ; 
of  wealth  is  escaping  taxation  for  National  purposes,  and  in  keeping 
with  our  promise  to  the  American  people,  we  have  submitted  this  just 
amendment  to  the  Federal  Constitution,  which  makes  constitutional  be- 
yond the  fine-spun  theories  of  learned  lawyers  the  most  just  of  all  taxes 
levied  upon  men.  [Applause.]  And  before  the  snow  flies  I  believe  that 
this  amendment  to  the  Federal  Constitution  will  be  endorsed  by  a  suffi- 
cient number  of  States  to  make  it  a  part  of  our  Constitution.  Then  will 
come  to  the  Democratic  party  the  honor  and"  the  glory  of  being  the 
only  political  organization  in  the  history  of  this  Republic  that  ever 
amended  the  Federal  Constitution  in  a  hundred  years  save  by  the  sword, 
[Applause.] 

I  believe  in  the  rigid  enforcement  of  the  Sherman  Anti-Trust  Law.  I 
would  not  proceed  against  these  great  monopolies  in  equity,  and  when  I 
found  them  guilty  tell  not  to  do  so  any  more,  or  order  them  to  divide 


126  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

their  army  of  pillage  into  separate  marauding  bands,  but  I  would  pro- 
ceed against  them  under  the  criminal  statutes  and  place  upon  them  the 
felon's  stripes.  [Applause.]  I  do  not  believe  that  a  monopoly  can  be 
reasonable,  and  I  would  no  more  give  to  a  trust  the  right  to  monopolize 
reasonably  than  I  would  give  a  thief  the  right  to  steal  reasonably. 
[Applause.]  These  trusts  must  be  destroyed.  The  American  people 
know  that  they  have  grown  up  and  have  been  fostered  and  encouraged 
by  the  Eepublican  party  and  that  they  cannot  rely  upon  that  party  to 
destroy  them.  They  have  no  vested  right.  Wrong  never  did  and  never 
will  have  a  vested  right  in  this  great,  free  and  just  Government. 

We  are  not  opposed  to  big  business.  We  recognize  that  in  a  biy 
country  there  must  be  big  business;  but  we  say  with  all  the  emphasis 
of  our  souls  that  big  business,  like  little  business,  must  obey  the  law. 
[Applause.]  We  would  strike  from  these  trusts  every  character  of  pro- 
tection. We  would  write  a  tariff  law  strictly  for  revenue  only,  and 
place  the  tax  first  upon  the  luxuries,  and  if  that  did  not  produce  sufficient 
revenue,  then  upon  the  comforts  of  life,  and  lastly  we  would,  if  neces- 
sary, lay  the  burden  of  taxation  upon  the  necessities  of  life.  These 
infant  industries  must  be  weaned.  [Applause.]  Infants  they  began, 
but  are  today  mighty  giants,  who  have  coalesced  their  strength — to  drive 
skyward  the  cost  of  living  and  oppress  the  people.  The  Republican  plat- 
form adopted  at  Chicago  upon  the  tariff  and  trust  questions  is  a  puzzle 
absolutely  meaningless  to  the  American  people,  but  they  may  rest  assured 
that  to  this  puzzle  the  trusts  hold  the  key.  Their  financial  plank  shows 
great  anxiety  to  make  it  easy  for  the  farmer  to  borrow  money.  It 
seems  that  they  recognize  that  their  rule  of  this  country  of  sixteen 
years  has  made  it  necessary  for  the  farmers  to  obtain  credit.  The 
Democratic  party  of  this  country  never  will  consent  that  our  finances  shall 
be  Aldrichized  or  controlled  by  the  Money  Trust,  for  they  are  yet  in- 
spired by  the  thought  that  Old  Hickory  Jackson  more  than  three- 
quarters  of  a  century  ago  stood  in  front  of  the  people's  treasury  and 
beat  back  these  money  changers.  That  spirit  still  lives  in  the  heart  of 
the  American  Democracy.  [Applause.] 

President  Taft  did  not  take  time  to  carry  out,  but  he  kicked  out 
the  Roosevelt  policies.  The  atonement  that  Roosevelt  offers  the  Ameri- 
can voters  that  he  succeeded  in  deceiving  by  the  election  of  President 
Taft  is  in  presenting  to  them  the  one  who  made  the  mistake — namely, 
himself.  The  American  people  fear  he  will  be  as  much  mistaken  in 
himself  as  he  was  in  President  Taft.  [Applause.]  The  atonement 
is  not  sufficient.  If  he  wants  to  come  with  clean  hands  and  a  clear 
conscience,  let  him  join  with  us,  and  do  what  ought  to  have  been  dons 
four  years  ago,  elect  a  Democratic  President.  [Applause.  | 

President  Taft  is  joined  to  his  idols.  His  administration  presents  the 
most  melancholy  spectacle  in  all  our  National  life.  Repudiated  in  the 
middle  of  his  term  by  the  election  of  a  Democratic  Congress,  his  re- 
nomination  forced  by  the  wholesale  unseating  of  honest  delegates,  lie  is 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  127 

left-handed  in  both  hands,  does  everything  wrong,  and  most  generally  on 
Friday.  Eoosevelt  undertakes  to  achieve  the  Presidency  by  proclaiming 
himself  the  advocate  of  those  policies  which  by  denouncing  he  won 
the  Presidency.  [Applause.]  Eoosevelt  says  Taft  is  too  friendly  with 
the  trusts.  President  Taft  says  Roosevelt  was  too  close  to  monopoly 
during  his  term — and  we  believe  them  both.  [Applause.] 

The  progressive  spirit  that  sweeps  this  country  now  is  called  by 
some  the  principles  of  the  Progressives,  by  others  the  doctrine  of  the 
Insurgents,  but  back  yonder,  when  a  voice  in  the  western  wilderness  cried 
out  for  them,  they  were  called  the  vagaries  of  Bryan,  the  dreamer. 
[Applause.]  However  much  we  may  differ  in  National  Conventions  upon 
minor  questions,  all  just  men  must  admit  that  the  one  living  American 
whose  name  will  shine  in  history,  studded  by  a  thousand  flaming  stars 
along  beside  that  of  Jefferson  and  Jackson,  is  that  of  William  Jen- 
nings Bryan,  of  Nebraska.  [Applause.] 

The  Democratic  Congress  not  only  scotched  Cannonism,  but  it  killed  it. 

They  said  we  were  unfriendly  to  the  soldiers  of  the  Union  Army,  that 
in  our  camps  the  fires  of  the  Civil  War  still  burned,  that  if  given  con- 
trol we  would  be  neither  just  nor  generous  to  these  veteran  heroes  of  the 
Civil  War.  But  behold  the  record  of  the  Democratic  Congress  still  in 
session.  It  remained  for  us  to  give  the  most  liberal  pensions  to  these  de- 
serving men  in  their  declining  years,  that  their  old  age  might  be  nisi  dp 
serene  and  bright.  They  charged  that  we  would  be  unjust  to  them,  now 
they  say  we  were  too  generous.  Nearly  half  a  century  after  the  war 
closed  it  remained  for  a  Democratic  Federal  General  to  father  the  bill 
that  did  even-handed  justice  to  the  Federal  soldiers.  [Applause.]  The 
war  is  over,  and  that  flag,  the  brightest,  dearest  colors  ever  knit  together 
in  a  banner  of  the  free,  waves  above  a  united  people,  where  it  is  loved 
by  every  heart  and  would  be  defended  by  every  hand.  And  coming  from 
the  South  as  I  do,  I  can  say  that  if  Abraham  Lincoln  were  alive  this 
night  there  is  not  a  foot  of  soil  under  Dixie's  sky  upon  which  he  might 
not  pitch  his  tent  and  pillow  his  head  upon  a  Confederate  soldier's  knee, 
and  sleep,  and  sleep  in  safety  there.  [Applause.] 

EECESS. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  next 
order  of  business  is  the  presentation  of  nominees  for  the  office  of 
President ;  and  it  being  desirable  that  all  names  should  be  presented  at 
the  same  session,  and  the  delegates  to  this  Convention  having  been  upon 
the  floor  nearly  four  hours,  I  move  that  the  Convention  take  a  recess  until 
8  o'clock  this  evening. 

MR.  JERRY  C.  SOUTH,  of  Arkansas:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  as  a  sub- 
stitute that  the  Convention  proceed  to  nominate  a  candidate  for  Presi- 
dent. Let  us  vote  down  the  motion  to  take  a  recess,  and  let  us  do 
business. 


128  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  is  on  the  motion  of  the 
gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr.  Palmer]  that  the  Convention  take  a 
recess  until  8  o'clock  this  evening. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to,  and  [at  3  o'clock  and  56  minutes  p.  m.] 
the  Convention  took  a  recess  until  8  o'clock  p.  m. 

EVENING    SESSION. 

At  the  expiration  of  the  recess  the  Convention   reassembled. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  ('onvt-ntion  will  be  opened  with 
prayer  by  Bev.  J.  Boss  Stevenson,  Pastor  of  the  Brown  Memorial  Church, 
of  Baltimore. 

PRAYER   OP   REV.   J.   ROSS   STEVENSON. 

REV.  J.  Ross  STEVENSON,  pastor  of  Brown  Memorial  Church.  Balti 
more,  Md.,  offered  the  following  prayer: 

Almighty  God,  the  King  of  kings  and  the  Lord  of  lords,  who  hath 
made  of  one  every  nation,  having  determined  their  appointed  seasons 
and  the  bounds  of  their  habitation.  Thou  hast  gathered  our  people  into 
a  great  nation  whose  power  for  right  extends  to  the  ends  of  the  earth. 
Looking  to  Thee,  the  source  of  all  authority  and  blessing,  deepen,  we 
pray  Thee,  the  root  of  our  life  in  everlasting  righteousness  and  let  not 
the  crown  of  our  pride  be  as  a  fading  flower.  Make  us  equal  to  our 
high  trusts — reverent  in  the  use  of  freedom,  just  in  the  exercise  of 
power,  generous  in  the  defense  of  weakness.  May  the  wisdom  and  power 
which  come  from  a  strong  trust  in  Thee  be  the  stability  of  our  times  that 
the  gains  of  our  industry  may  be  upright,  the  use  of  our  wealth  consider- 
ate and  our  prosperity  represent  the  highest  measure  of  virtue  and  happi- 
ness. We  thank  Thee  for  the  succession  of  legislators  and  rulers  who  have 
been  taught  the  wisdom  of  Thy  kingdom  and  whose  example  has  been  a 
power  for  good  in  the  life  of  the  nation ;  and  we  pray  Thee  to  strengthen 
and  sustain  with  Thine  Almighty  Hand  all  who  strive  to  govern  and  guide 
our  fellowmen  in  Thy  fear  and  Thy  love.  Thou  dost  instruct  us  to  select 
as  rulers  able  men,  such  as  fear  God — men  of  truth,  hating  unjust  gain, 
and  we  pray  that  this  Convention  may  be  so  under  Thy  direction  that  its 
nomination  may  record  Thy  choice  and  contribute  to  the  establishment  of 
truth  and  good  will.  Endue  all  who  take  part  in  this  night 's  proceedings 
with  a  right  understanding — a  pure  purpose,  sound  speech  that  cannot  be 
condemned,  and  enable  each  one  of  us  to  rise  above  all  self-seeking,  loc?l 
prejudice  and  sectional  zeal  into  the  larger  sentiments  of  public  good 
and  human  brotherhood,  and  government  of  the  people  and  for  the  people 
and  by  the  people.  For  Thine  is  the  kingdom  and  the  power  and  the 
glory  forever.  Amen. 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  129 

J.  PIERPONT  MORGAN,   THOMAS  F.   RYAN   AND   AUGUST 
BELMONT. 

MR.  WILLIAM  JENNINGS  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman,  I 
understand  that  the  rules  under  which  we  are  acting  require  that  reso- 
lutions be  referred  to  the  Committee  on  Resolutions.  I  have  a  resolu- 
tion which  I  think  ought  to  be  acted  upon  before  we  begin  the  nomina- 
tions. I  therefore  ask  unanimous  consent  for  its  immediate  considera- 
tion. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Is  there  objection  to  the  unanimous 
consent  asked  for  by  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska? 

SEVERAL  DELEGATES:     What  is  the  resolution? 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Is  there  objection  to  the  reading  of 
the  resolution?  [After  a  pause:]  The  Chair  hears  none.  The  gentle- 
man from  Nebraska  (Mr.  BRYAN)  will  read  the  resolution. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:     My  resolution  is  as   follows: 

"Resolved,  That  in  this  crisis  in  our  party's  career  and  in  our  coun- 
try's history" this  convention  °PTir1g  g^ppti^g  to  tbr  rrnpl"  if  th"  TTnitfH

gtill-Hm    f.hnmpinn     nf    pnpnlnn    gnvrniTunnnt    nnrl     equality    hpfnrp    tho    Iflw 

As  proof  of  cur  fidelity  to  the  penplo,  we  hereby  declare  ourselves  opposed 
to  the  nomination  of  any  candidate  for  president  who  is  the  representa- 
tive of  or  under  obligation  to  J.  Pierpont  Morgan,  Thomas  F.  Ryan, 
August  Belmont,  or  any  other  member  of  the  privilege-hunting  and 
favor-seeking  class. 

"Be  it  further  resolved,  That  we  demand  the  withdrawal  from  this 
convention  of  any  delegate  or  delegates  constituting  or  representing  the 
above-named  interests. ' ' 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Is  there  objection  to  the  immediate 
consideration  of  the  resolution?  If  there  is  objection,  it  takes  two- 
thirds  to  suspend  the  rules. 

MR.  THOMAS  J.  SPELLACY,  of  Connecticut:     I  object.' 

MR.  LUKE  LEA,  of  Tennessee:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a  question 
of  information.  So  that  this  convention  may  know  that  it  is  a  duly 
accredited  delegate  who  objects,  I  ask  that  the  objector  give  his  name. 

MR.  SPELLACY,  of  Connecticut:  Thomas  J.  Spellacy,  of  Connecticut, 
objects;  and  moves  that  the  resolution  be  referred  to  the  Committee  on 
Resolutions. 

MR.  JAMES  V.  COLEMAN,  of  California:  As  a  delegate  from  Cali- 
fornia, I  do  not  think  it  is  the  duty  of  this  convention  to  throw  dirt 
upon  anybody. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Objection  having  been  made  to  unani- 
mous consent,  I  move  to  suspend  the  rules  and  pass  the  resolution  at 
this  time. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Nebraska  moves 
to  suspend  the  rules  and  pass  the  resolution.  According  to  the  rules 


130  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

under  which  we  are  now  operating,  it  takes  two-thirds  to  suspend  the 
rules.  The  question  is,  shall  the  rules  be  suspended  and  the  resolution 
passed? 

MR.  A.  W.  GILCHRTST,  of  Florida:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a  point 
jQf  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  will  state  his  point  of 
order. 

MR.  GILCHRIST,  of  Florida:  I  raise  the  point  of  order  that  above  all 
things  else  for  which  the  Democratic  party  has  stood,  the  first  is  home 
rule  and  the  right  of  the  states  to  govern  themselves.  I  have  been  in- 
formed that  a  great  state  of  this  nation,  Virginia,  the  great  mother  of 
Presidents,  has  seen  fit  to  elect  as  a  delegate  to  this  convention  one  of 
the  men  named  in  this  resolution. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  One  moment.  Governor  Gilchrist  will 
state  his  point  of  order  first.  The  argument  will  come  afterward. 

MR.  GILCHRIST,  of  Florida :  I  make  the  point  of  order  that  when 
a  state  has  elected  delegates  to  this  convention,  we  have  no  right  to  go 
behind  the  election  of  delegates  made  by  a  sovereign  state  of  this 
nation.  [Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  holds  that  this  convention 
is  a  sovereign  body,  and  can,  by  suspending  the  rules,  do  whatever  it 
desires.  Therefore  the  motion  is  in  order.  .  Under  the  rules  each  side 
is  entitled  to  twenty  minutes  for  debate. 

MR.  EMMETT  O'NEAL,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  the  right  of 
every  delegate  to  hear  what  the  resolution  contains,  and  I  ask  that  it 
be  read  again,  so  that  every  member  of  this  Convention  can  vote  intelli- 
gently upon  it. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Nebraska  will 
read  the  resolution. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:      I  will  read  the  resolution  again: 

"Resolved,  That  in  this  crisis  in  our  party's  career  and  in  our  coun- 
try's history,  this  Convention  sends  greeting  to  the  people  of  the  United 
States,  and  assures  them  that  the  party  of  Jefferson  and  of  Jackson  is 
still  the  champion  of  popular  government  and  equality  before  the  law. 
As  proof  of  our  fidelity  to  the  people,  we  hereby  declare  ourselves  opposed 
to  the  nomination  of  any  candidate  for  President  who  is  the  representa- 
tive of  or  under  obligation  to  J.  Pierpont  Morgan,  Thomas  F.  Ryan, 
August  Belmont,  or  any  other  member  of  the  privilege-hunting  and  favor- 
seeking  class.  Be  it  further 

"Resolved,  That  we  demand  the  withdrawal  from  this  Convention  of 
any  delegate  or  delegates  constituting  or  representing  the  above-named 
interests. ' ' 

MR.  J.  RANDOLPH  ANDERSON,  of  Georgia:  Mr.  chairman,  I  move  to 
lay  the  resolution  upon-  the  table. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     The  gentleman  is  out  of  order.     The 


EMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION 


131 


gentleman  from  Nebraska   (Mr.  Bryan)  moves  to  suspend  the  rules  and 
pass  the  resolution,  and  has  the  floor  for  the  purpose  of  debate. 

MR.  DAVID  E.  FITZGERALD,  of  Connecticut:  Mr.  Chairman,  a  ques- 
tion for  information.  Do  I  understand  that  Mr.  Kyan  of  Virginia  and 
Mr.  Belmont  of  New  York  are  delegates  here  in  this  Convention? 

THE  PERMAXEXT  CHAIRMAN:  That  is  not  a  parliamentary  inquiry. 
The  gentleman  can  ascertain  that  for  himself  by  looking  at  the  printed 
list  of  delegates. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Members  of  this  Convention,  this  is  an 
extraordinary  resolution;"  but  extraordinary  conditions  need  extraordi- 
nary remedies.  We  are  now  engaged  in  the  conduct  of  a  convention 
that  will  place  before  this  country  the  Democratic  nominee,  and  I 
assume  that  every  delegate  in  this  convention  is  here  because  he  wants 
that  nominee  elected.  [Applause.]  It  is  in  order  that  we  may  advance 
the  cause  of  our  candidate  that  I  present  this  resolution. 

There  are  questions  of  which  a  court  takes  judicial  notice,  and  there 
are  subjects  upon   which  we  can  assume  that  the  American  people  are 
informed.     There  is  not  a  delegate  in  this  convention  who  does  not  know 
that  an  effort  is  being  made  right  now  to  sell  the  Democratic  party  into 
bondage  to  the  predatory  interests  of  this  nation.     It  is  the  most  brazen, 
the  most  insolent,  the  most  impudent  attempt  that  has  been  made  in  the   | 
history  of  American  politics  to  dominate  a  convention,  stifle  the  honest    ; 
sentiment  of  a  people  and  make  the  nominee  the  bond-slave  of  the  men 
who  exploit  the  people  of  this  country.     [Applause.] 

I  need  not  tell  you  that  J.  Pierpont  Morgan,  Thomas  F.  Ryan  and 
August  Belmont  are  three  of  the  men  who  are  connected  with  the  great 
money  trust  of  this  country,  who  are  as  despotic  in  their  rule  of  the 
business  of  the  country,  and  as  merciless  in  their  command  of  their 
slaves,  as  any  man  in  the  country.  [Applause.] 

Some  one  has  suggested  that  we  have  no  right  to  discuss  thex  dele- 
gates who  come  here  from  a  sovereign  State. 

MR.  GILCHRIST,  of  Florida:     I  said  that. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  I  reply  that  if  these  men  are  willing  to 
insult  six  and  a  half  million  Democrats,  we  ought  to  speak  out  against 
them,  and  let  them  know  we  resent  the  insult.  [Applause.] 

I  for  ono  am  not  willing  that  Thomas  F.  Ryan  and  August  Belmont 
shall  come  here  with  their  paid  attorneys  and  seek  secret  counsel  with 
the  managers  of  this  party.     [Applaus%.]     And  no  sense   of  politeness    i 
or  courtesy  to  such  men   will  keep  me   from   protecting  my   party  from 
the  disgrace  that  they  inflict   upon  us.      [Applause.] 

My  friends,  I  cannot  speak  for  you.     Yon  have  your  own  responsi-    : 
bility;  but  if  this  is  to  be  a  convention  run  by  these  men,  if  our  nominee    ' 
is  to  be  their  representative  and  tool.  T  pray  you  to  give  us,  who  repre- 
sent constituencies  that  do  not  want  this,  a  chance  to  go  on  record  with     j 
our  prottst  against  it.      [Applause.]      If  any  of  you  are  willing  to  nomi- 
nate a  candidate  who  represents  these  men,  or  who  is  under  obligation  to 


132  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

these  men,   do   it   and  take  the   responsibility.     I   refuse   to   take   that 
responsibility.     [Applause.] 

Some  have  said  that  we  have  not  a  right  to  demand  the  withdrawal 
of  delegates  from  this  convention.  I  will  make  you  a  proposition.  One 
of  these  men  sits  with  New  York  and  the  other  sits  with  Virginia.  I 
make  you  this  proposition:  If  the  State  of  New  York  will  take  a  poll 
of  her  delegates,  and  a  majority  of  them — not  Mr.  Murphy,  but  a  ma- 
jority of  the  delegates  on  a  roll  call,  where  her  delegates  can  have  their 
names  recorded  and  printed — do  not  ask  for  the  withdrawal  of  the  name 
of  Mr.  Belmont ;  and  if  Virginia  will  on  a  roil  call  protest  against  the 
withdrawal  of  Mr.  Ryan,  I  will  then  withdraw  the  last  part  of  the  reso- 
;  lution,  which  demands  the  withdrawal  of  these  men  from  the  Conven- 
;  tion.  I  will  withdraw  the  last  part,  on  the  request  of  the  State  delega-. 
tions  in  which  these  gentlemen  sit;  but  I  will  not  withdraw  the  first 
part,  which  demands  that  our  candidate  shall  be  free  from  entanglement 
with  them.  [Applause.] 

!MR.  HENRY  D.  FLOOD,  of  Virginia:  May  I  interrupt  the  gentleman? 
THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Does  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska 
yield  to  the  gentleman  from  Virginia? 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:     Certainly. 

MR.  FLOOD,  of  Virginia:  In  the  name  of  the  sovereign  State  of 
i  Virginia,  which  has  24  votes  on  this  floor,  I  accept  the  insolent  propo- 
i  sition  made  by  the  only  man  in  this  convention  who  wants  to  destroy 
j  the  prospect  of  Democratic  success.  [Applause.] 

MR.  JAMES  K.  VARDAMAN,  of  Mississippi:  Gentlemen  of  the  Con- 
vention, I  sincerely  hope  that  the  members  of  this  organization  will 
preserve  order  while  the  discussion  of  this  question,  so  vital  to  the 
Democracy  of  America,  proceeds.  You  cannot  settle  anything  by  the 
use  of  your  throats.  The  time  has  arrived  in  the  history  of  this 
organization  when  reason,  good  common  sense  and  moderation  should 
control  the  deliberations  of  this  body.  We  cannot  afford  to  permit 
this  opportunity,  which  the  Democracy  now  enjoys,  to  be  squandered. 
I  think  the  resolution  which  has  been  presented  to  you  by  Mr.  Bryan 
contains  in  part  some  merit. 

I  most  heartily  approve  the  first  part  of  the  resolution.  I  do  not 
want  you,  nor  would  I  have  this  convention  trench  upon  the  rights  of 
the  States  in  the  selection  of  delegates  [applause] ;  but  I  also  agree 
with  him  that  the  fewer  we  have  of  the  class  he  named,  the  better  it 
will  be  for  Democracy  in  November.  [Applause.] 

I '  am  goiug  to  ask  you  to  be  quiet  and  preserve  order  while  Mr. 
Bryan  makes  a  statement  to  the  Convention. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:    I  yield  to  Mr.  Price,  of  Virginia. 

MR.  JOHN  W.  PRICE,  of  Virginia:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  on  behalf  of  the  sovereign  State  of  Virginia,  we  pro- 
test as  to  the  latter  part  of  the  resolution,  but  no  one  will  accede  more 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONTENTION 


heartily  and  more  thoroughly  to  the  first  part  of  the  resolution  than 
the  State  of  Virginia. 

Virginia  has  always  been  able  to  control  her  own  internal  affairs. 
[Applause.]  She  has  never  yet  asked  aid  or  help  from  any  outside 
influence.  [Applause.]  If  there  are  undesirable  citizens  on  the  dele- 
gation from  Virginia,  Virginia  will  take  that  responsibility.  [Ap- 
plause.] Last  night  on  the  Ohio  resolution  there  were  only  three  and 
one-half  votes  against  sustaining  the  minority  report,  and  today  on  the 
Utah  resolution  it  was  unanimous.  Virginia  is  able  to  right  her 
wrongs  and  demand  her  rights  at  the  hands  of  this  Convention.  [Ap- 
plause.] Mr.  Bryan  has  very  kindly  yielded  me  this  moment,  and  he 
will  now  make  his  own  statement. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  I  shall  modify  my  proposition  to  this 
extent:  Virginia  has  notified  me,  through  two  of  her  representatives, 
that  she  desires  the  last  part  of  this  resolution  withdrawn  as  to  her. 
If  a  delegate  authorized  to  speak  for  New  York  will  rise  and  ask  that 

the  last  part  of  the  resolution  be  withdrawn [Cries  of  "  No !  "] 

Does  New  York  ask  the  withdrawal  of  the  last  part  of  the  resolution? 
[Cries  of  "No!"] 

MR.  BRYAN  F.  MAHAN,  of  Connecticut:  Let  the  gentleman  himself 
withdraw  it. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska :  I  prefer  to  give  New  York  the  oppor- 
tunity. I  yield  the  floor  to  the  opposition,  reserving  what  time  I  have 
left  to  close  the  discussion. 

ME.  WILLIAM  A.  MCCORKLE,  of  West  Virginia:  Mr.  Chairman,  am 
I  at  liberty  to  say  a  few  words  upon  this  resolution  at  this  time? 

THE  PERMANENT   CHAIRMAN:     The  gentleman  is  recognized. 

MR.  MCCORKLE,  of  West  Virginia:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention, 
in  great  crises  in  the  history  of  a  party  or  a  country,  men  are  dis- 
tressed at  their  inferiority  of  ability  to  discuss  these  great  questions. 
I  am  a  plain  mountain  man,  from  a  mountain  State  which  has  been 
combatting  the  forces  of  Eepublicanism  hopelessly  and  almost  help- 
lessly for  twenty  years,  under  the  leadership  of  Mr.  Bryan.  [Applause.] 
It  seemed  that  the  time  had  now  come  when,  in  the  language  of  the 
eloquent  and  distinguished  chairman  of  this  convention,  we  could  see 
the  starlight  of  hope  breaking  through  the  darkness  of  this  long  night. 

Sirs,  I  do  not  personally  know  one  of  the  gentlemen  named  in  this 
resolution.  I  have  no  interest  in  common  with  those  which  they  have. 
The  resolution  of  itself  is  one  upon  which  all  Democrats  may  meet; 
but,  my  friends,  when  they  do  meet  it  must  be  under  circumstances 
that  demand  it.  The  Democratic  party  has  never  in  its  history  been 
controlled  by  any  interest.  [Applause.]  Today  the  Democratic  party 
does  not  believe  in  control  by  these  gentlemen,  or  any  interest  con- 
nected with  them.  [Applause.]  But  that  is  not  the  proposition.  When 
Mr.  Bryan's  resolution  goes  to  the  country,  it  goes  with  the  idea  that, 
the  Democratic  party  is  contra-disposed  to  any  of  the  material  interests 


134  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

of  this  country.  While  we  are  not  disposed  to  allow  this  party  to  be 
controlled  by  any  interest,  I  appeal  to  every  Democrat  within  the  sound 
of  my  voice,  upon  his  good  sense  and  upon  his  discretion,  and  upon  the 
reason  of  the  matter,  is  not  the  resolution  a  senseless  and  foolish  one? 
[Applause.] 

I  know  that  it  will  be  heralded  in  the  morning  that  I  am  for  the 
interests;  but,  fellow  Democrats,  a  man  who  is  not  willing  to  walk 
to  the  front  and  take  his  political  life  in  his  hand  in  order  ip  save  his 
party,  is  not  worthy  of  a  place  on  this  floor.  [Applause.]  Therefore 
it  seems  to  me  that  now,  when  the  whole  heart  and  soul  of  the  Demo- 
cratic party  is  in  success,  when  it  seems  that  the  hour  has  come  when 
we  can  scourge  the  money  changers  out  of  the  temple,  if  they  are  there, 
the  time  has  come  when  the  Democratic  party  with  its  principles  of 
honesty  and  justice  can  do  right,  after  it  has  so  long  been  powerless; 
it  seems,  under  the  circumstances,  that  this  resolution  can  only  provoke 
strife  and  trouble,  and  put  success,  farther  away  than  it  was  half  an 
hour  ago.  [Applause.] 

Oh,  men  of  the  Democratic  party,  when  we  meet  here  tonight  in  this 
assemblage  it  is  for  the  purpose  of  deliberation,  and  deliberation  means 
compromise;  and  fair,  decent  compromise,  whose  principle  is  not 
destroyed,  is  what  the  Democratic  party  demands  today.  Therefore,  I 
hope  that  it  will  be  the  decision  of  this  Convention,  looking  to  the  fact 
that  we  must  recognize  the  good,  honest,  substantial  interests  of  this 
country  which  the  intendment  of  this  resolution  drives  away  from  us, 
to  vote  down  this  resolution.  [Applause.]  And  when  we  ask  that  the 
resolution  be  defeated,  it  is  not  for  the  purpose  of  telling  the  country 
and  the  world  that  we  are  tied  to  the  chariot  wheels  of  these  men  whom 
Mr.  Bryan  mentions  in  his  resolution,  but  it  is  intended  to  say  to  the 
world  that  now  is  not  the  time  for  such  a  resolution. 

Ah,  gentlemen,  let  us  compromise  a  few  things  when  we  do  not 
compromise  principle,  and  let  us  go  along  here  as  we  have  gone  along 
for  sixteen  years,  and  do  some  of  the  things  that  are  sensible,  instead 
of  flying  in  the  teeth  of  all  the  things  which  conservatism  and  care 
and  progress  demand  at  our  hands.  [Applause.]  I  hope  that  this  dis- 
tinguished gentleman  will  see  better.  I  hope  that  he  will  conclude  that 
this  Convention  agrees  wyith  him  when  he  asks  that  it  shall  not  tie 
itself  to  the  w:heels  of  the  chariot  of  the  gentlemen  he  mentioned ;  but 
this  resolution  is  not  needed  here  tonight.  [Applause]  because  we  will 
speak  tomorrow  through  our  great  Platform  Committee,  which  will 
enunciate  the  principles  we  love,  and  which  we  believe  should  be  the 
announced  principles  of  this  Convention. 

Therefore,  gentlemen,  not  belonging  to  the  predatory  interests,  not 
believing  in  control  by  the  predatory  interests,  but  believing  in  the 
wisdom  which  looks  at  the  sensible  view  of  a  political  as  well  as  any 
other  situation,  I  ask  and  hope  that  this  Convention  will  have  the 


i&gt;i;MocitATic  NATIONAL  CONVENTION 


courage,  the  character,  the  manhood  and  the  statesmanship  to  vote 
clown  this  resolution.  [Applause.] 

Mi:.  FLOOD,  of  Virginia:  I  simply  want  to  supplement  the  state- 
ment I  made  by  correcting  the  impression  that  Mr.  Bryan 's  subsequent 
statement  must  have  made  upon  this  Convention.  We  of  Virginia  did 
not  ask  anything  of  Mr.  Bryan.  We  do  not  feel  that  we  have  to  go 
to  him  to  get  him  to  vise  our  delegation.  [Applause.]  A  convention 
of  1,000  Virginians,  as  honest  men  as  William  J.  Bryan  ever  was,  and 
as  good  Democrats  as  he  ever  can  be  [applause]  elected  Mr.  Thomas 
F.  Eyan,  without  a  dissenting  voice,  as  one  of  the  delegates  to  represent 
Virginia  in  this  Convention.  [Applause.] 

When  this  remarkable  resolution  was  read  I  came  to  the  platform 
at  the  suggestion  of  the  Virginia  delegation  to  protest  against  it. 
Mr.  Bryan  proposed  to  withdraw  it  if  the  Virginia  delegates  protested 
against  it.  I  took  that  as  a  challenge  from  him,  to  mean  that  he 
inferred  that  our  delegation  would  not  protest  against  it;  and  I  said 
that  in  the  name  of  the  Virginia  delegation  I  accepted  the  insolent 
proposition  made  by  the  only  man  in  this  country  who  wishes  to  destroy 
the  Democratic  party.  [Applause.]  I  simply  meant  to  accept  his 
challenge.  I  am  glad  he  decided  to  withdraw  that  part  of  the  resolution 
which  we  consider  reflects  upon  the  integrity,  honor  and  manhood  of  the 
State  of  Virginia.  [Applause.]  But  we  would  never  have  asked  it, 
and  we  were  ready  to  stand  here  and  submit  to  this  great  Convention 
the  question  whether  they  would  cast  such  an  ignominious  reflection 
upon  the  splendid  Democracy  of  Virginia  as  to  adopt  any  such  foolish 
resolution.  [Applause.] 

MR.  BRYAX.  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman  and  delegates,  it  was  not 
necessary  that  the  gentleman  from  Virginia  should  deliver  a  eulogy 
of  that  State.  That  is  the  State  in  which  my  father  was  born,  and  I 
would  be  the  last  man  to  reflect  upon  it.  [Applause.]  I  know  the 
Democrats  of  Virginia,  and  four  years  ago  they  refused  to  allow  their 
leading  public  men  to  act  as  delegates,  unless  they  consented  to  go 
instructed  for  my  third  nomination. 

It  is  not  necessary  for  me  to  defend  my  own  Democracy.  My 
friends,  when  my  reputation  as  a  Democrat  needs  to  be  defended,  my 
reputation  as  a  Democrat  will  not  be  worth  defending.  My  reputation 
as  a  Democrat  will  not  be  worth  defending  whenever  it  becomes  neces- 
sary for  me  to  defend  it  against  a  charge  made  by  a  friend  of  Thomas 
F.  Ryan. 

I  now  withdraw  the  latter  part  of  the  resolution,  for  I  do  not  intend 
that  any  member  of  this  Convention  shall  shield  his  negative  vote, 
against  the  principal  part  of  the  resolution,  by  hiding  behind  the  latter 
part  of  it.  [Applause.]  I  intend  that  the  men  who  think  the  first 
part  of  this  resolution  is  either  wrong  or  unnecessary  shall  have  a 
chance  to  say  so  on  roll  call. 

In   answer  to   the   argument   of   the   gentleman   from   West   Virginia 

I 


136  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

(Mr.  McCorkle)  that  this  question  ought  not  to  be  brought  up  now  for 
fear  of  disturbing  harmony,  I  present  him  the  Bible  doctrine — and  1 
challenge  him  to  deny,  if  he  can — ' '  If  thy  right  hand  offend  thee, 
cut  it  off;"  and  I  am  sure  that  if  it  is  worth  while  to  cut  off  the  right 
hand  to  save  the  body,  it  is  worth  while  to  cut  off  Morgan,  Kyan  and 
Belmont  to  save  the  Democratic  party.  [Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  now  presents  the  Hon. 
Lewis  Ni?on,  of  New  York. 

MR.  LEWIS  NIXON,  of  New  York:  Fellow  delegates  and  Demo- 
crats, the  sovereign  State  of  New  York,  with  a  befitting  sense  of  self- 
respect,  does  not  ask  and  does  not  request  that  any  part  of  this  reso- 
lution be  withdrawn.  We  demand  a  vote.  [Applause.] 

MR.  THOMAS  J.  SPELLACY,  of  Connecticut:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask 
that  the  resolution  in  the  form  in  which  it  is  now  offered  by  the 
gentleman  from  Nebraska  be  read. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  resolution  will  be  read  as  it  is 
now  offered  for  consideration  by  the  Convention,  the  latter  part  of  it 
having  been  withdrawn. 

MB.  NIXON,  of  New  York:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a  point  of  order. 
The  gentleman  cannot  withdraw  a  part  of  this  resolution  without 
unanimous  consent. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  overrules  the  point  of 
order.  The  resolution  as  now  offered  will  be  read  to  the  Convention. 

MR.  SPELLACY,  of  Connecticut:  I  ask  for  the  reading  of  the  whole 
resolution. 

MR.  E.  L.  WILLIAMS,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a  point 
of  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  gentleman  will   state   it. 

MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Oklahoma:  The  point  of  order  is  that  the  motion 
to  suspend  the  rules  is  the  only  motion  before  the  house. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  is  about  to  have  the  reso- 
lution which  is  before  the  house  read.  The  motion  is  to  suspend  the 
rules  and  pass  the  resolution. 

The  secretary  read  the  resolution  as  follows: 

"Resolved,  That  in  this  crisis  in  our  party's  career  aad  in  our 
country's  history  this  Convention  sends  greeting  to  the  people  of  the 
United  States,  and  assures  them  that  the  party  of  Jefferson  and  of 
Jackson  is  still  the  champion  of  popular  government  and  equality  before 
the  law.  As  proof  of  our  fidelity  to  the  people  we  hereby  declare 
ourselves  opposed  to  the  nomination  of  any  candidate  for  President 
who  is  the  representative  of,  or  under  any  obligation  to  J.  Pierpont 
Morgan,  Thomas  F.  Kyan,  August  Belmont,  or  any  other  member  of  the 
privilege-hunting  and  favor-seeking  class." 

MR.  JAMES  K.  VARDAMAN,  of  Mississippi:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gen- 
tlemen of  the  Convention,  we  understand  that  the  question  before  the 


I 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL

INVENTION  137 


house  is  not  the  adoption  of  the  resolution,  but  that  it  is  to  suspend 
the  rules  for  the  introduction  of  the  resolution. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Oh,  no;  the  motion  is  to  suspend  the 
rules  and  adopt  the  resolution.  On  that  motion  the  secretary  will  call 
the  roll. 

MR.  W.  W.  BRANDON,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  a  point  of 
order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :    The  gentleman  will  state  it. 

MR.  BRANDON,  of  Alabama:  Is  it  in  order  to  move  to  suspend  the 
rules  to  put  the  resolution  upon  its  passage? 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  We  are  operating  under  the  rules 
of  the  House  of  Eepresentatives  of  the  Sixty-second  Congress.  The 
motion  is  to  suspend  the  rules  and  pass  the  resolution. 

ME.  BRANDON,  of  Alabama :  The  motion  being  in  that  form,  what 
vote  of  the  Convention  does  it  take? 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  It  takes  a  vote  of  two-thirds  of  the 
Convention  to  agree  to  the  motion.  The  secretary  will  call  the  roll. 

The  Secretary  having  called  the  roll,  the  result  was  announced —

NOMINATION   OF   CANDIDATES   FOB   PRESIDENT. 

MR.  G.  F.  MENZIES,  of  Indiana:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  .that  we  now 
proceed  immediately  to  the  nomination  of  candidates  for  President. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Under  the  order  of  business  already 
adopted,  the  Chair  directs  that  the  roll  of  States  be  called  for  the  pur- 
pose of  i rrt&gt;iving  nominations  of  candidates  for  President. 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  139 

Ma.  MENZIES,  of  Indiana:  I  move  that  the  nominating  siKvcheg  be 
limited  to  thirty  minutes  and  the  second  speeches  to  five  minutes. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Indiana  moves 
that  the  nominating  speeches  be  limited  to  thirty  minutes  and  the  sec- 
onding speeches  to  five  minutes.  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the 
motion. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

MR.  WILLIAM  ,J.  STONE,  of  Missouri  :  Mr.  Chairman,  as  I  under- 
stand, the  resolution  reported  by  the  Committee  on  Eules  was  adopted 
by  the  Convention,  fixing  the  time  to  be  occupied  by  speakers. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Senator  from  Missouri  is  right. 
It  fixes  the  iime  at  thirty  minutes. 

MR.  STONE,  of  Missouri:      Then  does  this  motion  annul  the  resolution? 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  It  does  -not,  because  it  is  the  very 
same  thing  that  was  contained  in  the  report  of  the  Committee  on  Eules 
and  Order  of  Business,  except  that  it  limits  the  seconding  speeches  to 
five  minutes.  The  secretary  will  call  the  roll. 

The  secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

MR.  EMMETT  O'NEAL,  of  Alabama:  (When  the  State  of  Alabama 
was  called.)  Mr.  Chairman,  Hon.  William  B.  Bankhead  will  speak  for 
the  State  of  Alabama. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  I  take  pleasure  in  presenting  to  the 
Convention  Hon.  Wm.  B.  Bankhead,  of  Alabama. 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  WILLIAM  B.  BANKHEAD. 

MR,  WILLIAM  B.  BANKHEAD,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gen- 
tlemen of  the  Convention,  this  magnificent  convention  is  prophetic  of 
Democratic  victory  in  November.  The  Republican  party  has  become,  in 
the  hours  of  its  present  degeneracy,  the  embodiment  of  complacent 
incompetency  and  broken  faith. 

Asserting  itself  to  be  the  protector  of  labor  and  the  custodian  of  all 
political  virtue,  much  of  the  reward  that  has  come  to  those  who  trusted 
in  its  integrity  has  been  to  observe  the  uniform  regularity  with  which 
the  fruits  of  labor  have  been  gathered  as  dividends  by  illegal  combina- 
tions in  restraint  of  trade. 

Commissioned  with  a  new  lease  of  power  in  the  last  national  election 
by  the  votes  of  those  who  relied  upon  the  declarations  of  its  platform 
for  relief  from  intolerable  economic  conditions,  the  sum  total  of  its 
achievements  has  been  the  further  impoverishment  of  the  poor  —  plus  a 
placid  tariff  board  whose  deliberations  give  no  reasonable  promise  of 
relief  from  the  present  unbearable  burdens.  The  conflict  between  the 
arrogance  of  the  standpatteis  and  the  vehemence  of  the  so-called  pro- 
gressives of  that  party  has  furnished  convincing  proof  thai  it  is  either 
deaf  to  the  promptings  of  new  political  duty,  or  that  on  the  other  hand, 


140  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

in  its  greed  for  power,  it  is  eager  to  bind  itself  to  rush  recklessly  forth 
in  directions  where  disaster  will  certainly  await  the  Eepublic. 

For  months  the  people  of  this  country  and  of  all  countries  have  been 
confronted  by  the  humiliating  spectacle  of  a  former  President  and  the 
present  Chief  Executive  of  the  United  States  engaged  in  a  tirade  of 
recriminations,  in  which  the  vocabulary  of  Billingsgate  has  been  ex- 
hausted, the  best  traditions  of  controversy  forgotten  and  the  high  ideals 
of  statesmanship  thrown  to  the  winds. 

One  benefit  has  come  from  it  all,  however,  in  that  ample  proof  has 
been  forthcoming,  varying  only  in  kind  and  degree,  to  sustain  the  con- 
tentions of  both  factions  of  the  opposition,  and  to  convince  intelligent 
and  discriminating  men  that  when  the  recognized  leaders  of  the  Repub- 
lican party  thus  fall  foul  of  one  another,  there  has  come  the  dawning 
of  that  good  day  when  the  people  are  to  restore  to  full  power  and  re- 
sponsibility' the  Democratic  party,  which  has  made  it  evident  that  it 
intends  to  serve  the  real  interests  of  the  people  if  given  full  opportunity 
to  redeem  its  solemn  pledges.  [Applause.] 

And  little  wonder  was  it  that  the  people,  scourged  from  power  in  the 
House  of  Representatives  that  party  which  forgot  its  promises,  promoted 
increase  in  the  cost  of  living  by  acceding  to  the  never  satisfied  deuands 
of  the  special  interests ;  and  that  the  people  were  prepared  to  turn  again 
for  equality  of  opportunity  to  the  great  Democratic  principles  of  Thomas 
Jefferson,  Andrew  Jackson,  Samuel  J.  Tilden  and  Grover  Cleveland. 
[Applause.] 

We  challenge  the  opposition,  however  resourceful  it  may  be  in  sophism, 
to  successfully  deny  that  every  essential  pledge  of  the  last  Democratic 
platform  has  been  abundantly  kept  in  spirit  and  in  letter  by  the  Demo- 
cratic Congress  and  would  be  in  force  and  effect  today  as  the  law,  but 
for  the  indefensible  opposition  and  brutal  veto  power  of  a  Republican 
President. 

The  acts  of  the  Democratic  party  have  appealed  to  the  conscience 
and  judgment  of  the  country  as  wise,  conservative  and  yet  safe  and  pro- 
gressive. Its  record  has  not  been  that  of  vacillation  either  in  promise 
or  performance,  and  while  it  has  gone  forward  in  progress  it  has  not 
departed  from  the  best  traditions  which  we  as  a  people  cherish.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

And  though  success,  under  right  conditions,  is  within  our  grasp, 
never  has  it  been  more  essential  than  now  for  us  to  nominate  our  best 
and  strongest  man, — one  who  will  attract  the  confidence  and  insure  the 
enthusiastic  support  not  only  of  our  party  but  of  that  large  body  of 
Republican  voters  who  are  out  of  sympathy  with  the  acts  and  tendencies 
of  their  party,  and  who  are  seeking  to  avoid  the  dangers  which,  under 
the  supremacy  of  Republican  rule,  threaten  not  only  the  prosperity  but 
the  security  of  the  Republic.  There  is  no  safety,  however,  in  the  experi- 
ment of  picking  our  nominee  in  haphazard  fashion  from  among  those 
who  possess  this  or  that  special  gift,  engaging  as  it  may  be,  unless  it

has  some  intimate  relation  to  the  requirements  of  an  exacting  campaign, 
to  the  chief  issue  before  the  people  and  to  the  duties  and  needs  of  our 
greatest  executive  office.  [Applause.] 

If  any  intelligent,  loyal  Democrat  entertains  doubts  as  to  what  rhat 
paramount  issue  is,  that  part  of  the  platform  just  adopted  dealing  with 
this  question  should  resolve  all  his  doubts.  Renewing  its  strength  and 
vigor  by  dedicating  itself  once  more,  as  it  has  done  in  that  platform,  to 
its  articles  of  faith  and  principles,  the  Democratic  party,  true  to  its 
best  traditions  as  the  servant  of  the  people,  has  pledged  itself  to  a  revi- 
sion of  the  tariff,  fair  to  the  manufacturer  but  fair  also  to  the  consumer 
and  the  public,  whereby  an  end  shall  be  put  to  existing  inequalities  and 
injustices.  [Applause.]  There  are  other  issues,  but  for  the  time  our 
platform  makes  it  clear  they  are  subordinate.  And  the  spirit  as  well  as 
the  letter  of  this  part  of  the  platform  shows  conclusively  that  the  indus- 
trial interests  of  the  country  will  be  safe  and  prosperous  too,  in  Demo 
cratic  hands.  [Applause.] 

So  unjust  is  the  present  tariff  that  no  one,  Democrat  or  Republican, 
today  dares  rise  up  and  defend  its  further  continuance,  for  it  stands  for 
industrial  favoritism  and  industrial  bondage,  and  for  a  prosperity  which 
is  merely  artificial  and  spasmodic,  and  not  real  and  enduring. 

Let  us  then  start  our  campaign  for  righteousness  by  an  act  which 
will  be  proof  to  all  that  we  do  not  propose  to  "Keep  the  word  of  promise 
to  the  ear  and  break  it  to  the  hope";  but  that,  as  we  stand  for  that 
great  issue,  we  stand  for  the  great  man  who  has  made  that  issue  pos- 
sible, and  whose  great  privilege  it  was  and  whose  advantage  it  now  is, 
that  he  led  a  courageous,  unfaltering  fight  against  the  redoubts  behind 
which  lay  entrenched  the  present  tariff  inequality.  [Applause.] 

What  manner  of  man  then  shall  this  convention  raise  up  to  be  its 
standard  bearer?  He  should  be  one  who  stands  four  square  to  every 
test  of  moral,  mental  and  physical  equipment — who  has  that  fibre  of 
independence  that  makes  it  impossible  for  him  to  break  faith  with  him- 
self or  his  fellowman ;  that  quality  of  mind  that  enables  him  to  see  "the 
near  side  of  far  things  and  the  far  side  of  jjear  things";  that  quality 
of  manhood,  character  and  intelligence  so  nicely  developed  as  to  enable 
him  to  discharge  with  dignity  and  credit  the  exacting  and  delicate  public 
duties  of  the  Chief  Executive.  [Applause.] 

He  should  have  had  political  training  and  experience,  for  these  are 
almost  as  essential  qualifications  in  a  nominee  for  the  Presidency  as  are 
the  clinic  and  class-room  for  the  physician  and  surgeon.  Without  any 
pretentious  parade  of  the  virtue,  he  should  be  progressively  conservative 
and  conservatively  progressive,  moving  forward  as  the  uncompromising 
foe  of  crude,  cheap  experiment  along  lines  whose  direction  has  been 
established  by  safe  and  tried  precedents — not  having  for  his  chief  stock- 
in-trade  the  smug  satisfaction  of  the  standpatter,  nor,  on  the  other  hand, 
merely  conspicuous  as  the  sponsor  for  strange  and  subversive  doctrine. 
He  must  be  a  man  who  has  not  tied  the  ship  which  he  commands  to 


OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

the  wharves  of  party  or  political  tradition  to  rot  there,  but  be  ever 
ready  to  sail  on  to  new  havens,  but  always  without  discarding  chart  and 
compass  for  the  voyage.  He  must  be  well-balanced,  thoughtful,  delib- 
erative; and  yet,  in  ability  to  inspire  enthusiasm  among  his  fellows,  be 
a  natural  leader  of  men.  While  he  must  be  popular,  he  must  posses? 
that  enduring  popularity  which  has  for  its  sure  foundation  established 
character  and  true  worth;  and  he  must  be  ready  to  serve  in  command  or 
in  the  ranks,  and  be  able  to  truthfully  say  what  a  distinguished  Demo- 
cratic statesman  once  said  in  electric  phrase,  when  asking  for  worthy 
men  to  join  him  in  a  great  struggle  for  reform :  "I  will  lead  where 
any  one  shall  dare  to  follow,  and  I  will  follow  where  anyone  shall  dare 
to  lead."  [Applause.] 

He  must  have  that  wisdom  which  comes  not  alone  from  books,  but 
from  a  life  among  men.  No  breath  of  scandal  must  ever  come  near 
him  to  tarnish  a  bright  record,  for  he  must  be  the  soul  of  great  honor, 
and  have  been  weighed  in  the  balance  and  not  found  wanting;  he  must 
be  a  man  courageous  but  not  foolhardy,  who  in  his  acts  takes  counsel 
of  his  better*  judgment ;  not  seeking  the  applause  of  the  moment,  but 
willing,  to  find  the  defense  for  his  conduct  in  the  calm  verdict  of  his 
fellowmen  and  in  the  approval  of  his  own  conscience.  [Applause.] 

Eegardful  of  the  rights  of  labor  and  of  capital,  he  must  be  ready 
not  only  to  apply  the  knowledge  he  has  gained  through  old  experience  to 
present  emergencies,  but  to  recognize  that  "New  occasions  teach  new 
duties,  and  time  makes  ancient  good  uncouth."  He  must  feel  the  throb- 
bings  of  that  great  pulse  of  humanity  that  is  quickening  the  hopes  ami 
aspirations  of  the  world,  having  done  and  being  always  ready  to  do. 
what  lies  in  his  power  to  sec  to  it  that  in  the  path  of  men  who  labor 
with  hand  or  brain,  there  shall  be  interposed  no  unfair  obstacle  to  keep 
them  from  bettering  their  condition  and  reaching  those  heights  from 
which  they  may  be  enabled  to  see  inspiring  visions.  He  must  be%  one 
who  by  deed  as  well  as  by  word  has  taught  the  gospel  of  co-operation 
among  men,  and  never  been  content  with  the  spurious  substitute  of  mer^ 
charity  as  a  kind  of  peace  offering  or  penance  from  those  who  have 
profited  by  the  unfair  advantages  of  discriminating  laws,  to  those  de- 
prived of  that  opportunity.  He  must  have  the  capacity  to  win  great 
honors  for  the  Democratic  party,  and  so  establish  it  in  the  public  confi 
dence  that  the  people  will  grant  to  it  a  long  tenure  of  office. 

Judged  by  the  qualifications  suggested,  by  his  demonstrated  ability. 
extraordinary  sagacity  and  capacity  for  leadership,  I  shall  presently 
present  the  name  of  that  Democrat  who  would  not  only  fill  but  grace 
the  Presidential  chair.  He  was  born  in  Kentucky,  spent  his  youth  in 
Minnesota  and  now,  at  the  full  meridian  of  capacity  for  public  service, 
resides  in  Alabama.  So  that,  by  the  ties  of  birth,  youthful  association 
and  present  residence,  he  appeals  to  every  type  of  voter  in  all  parties 
that  believes  that  this  country  must  now,  at  the  cross-roads  of  its  des- 
tiny, choose  a  man  -whose  equipment  is  broad  enough  to  include  a  deep 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  143 

and  abiding  interest   in  whatever  is   for  th'&gt;   best   interests  of  American 
citizens  and  of  American  institutions. 

His  availability  as  a  candidate  cannot  be  questioned.  It  is  gratifying 
to  those  who  know  the  generous  hearts  of  the  American  people  to  appre- 
ciate the  fact  that  sectional  differences  are  forgotten,  and  the  once-called 
Mason  and  Dixon  's  line  has  long  since  been  tramped  out  by  the  foot- 
steps of  friendly  intercourse  and  commercial  relations.  When  the  Con- 
gress of  the  United  States,  imbued  with  a  splendid  spirit  of  sectional 
reconciliation,  recently  made  a  generous  appropriation  for  the  expenses 
of  the  joint  re-union  of  the  survivors  of  the  Army  of  the  North  and  the 
Army  of  the  Ciinfederacy.  to  be  held  next  July  on  the  historic  heights 
of  Gettysburg,  surely  has  come  the  day  when  the  last  semblance  of  sec- 
tional feeling  has  departed  from  the  hearts  of  men.  When  bivouacked 
around  the  camp  fires  on  Cemetery  Hill  the  grizzled  veterans  of  Grant 
and  Lee  shall  send  towards  the  night-hushed  skies  the  swelling  chorus 
of  the  "Battle  Hymn  of  the  Republic,"  I  imagine  that  a  Benign  Deity 
will  breathe  upon  that  hallowed  scene  a  benediction  and  a  blessing 
[Applause.] 

Our  candidate  is  a  master  of  every  detail  of  tariff  legislation,  upon 
which  hangs  our  reasonable  hope  of  relief  from  insufferable  conditions. 
It  is  logical  to  put  him  in  command  of  the  forces  in  that  battle  where 
his  brilliant  achievements  have  already  created  Democracy's  opportunity 
and  redeemed  Democratic  pledges. 

Nominate  him,  and  the  platform,  instead  of  being  so  much  party 
declaration,  will  become  the  creed  of  a  waiting  people,  who  believe  of 
the  unjust  trusts  what  Isaiah  believed  of  the  princes  and  elders:  "It 
is  ye  who  have  eaten  up  the  vineyard,  and  the  spoil  of  the  poor  is  in 
your  houses."  Nominate  him,  because  his  sterling  reputation  is  not  the 
creation  of  a  day  or  night,  but  the  sure  and  steady  growth  of  eighteen 
years  of  splendid  service  in  Congress,  culminating  in  conceded  party 
leadership,  never  sleeping  upon  his  watch  and  never  faithless  to  the  best 
interests  of  his  party  or  to  American  institutions. 

Nominate  him  primarily  because,  with  the  foresight  of  a  patriotic 
statesman,  he  has  fought,  and  will  continue  to  fight,  for  a  lower  cost  of 
living,  for  an  equal  opportunity  for  all  men  through  the  enactment  of 
a  now  and  righteous  tariff.  And  when  the  sound  of  the  trumpet  that 
calls  him  to  lead  our  party  to  victory  shall  be  heard  in  the  land,  even 
as  in  the  days  when  Jericho  perished  and  the  curse  went  forth  against 
him  who  should  ever  rebuild  it,  the  people  shall  shout  with  a  great  shout, 
and  the  walls  of  the  Republican  stronghold — which  across  the  path  of  the 
true  advancement  of  this  nation  now  stand  in  their  sullen  defiant  in- 
solence for  centralization  and  personalization  and  usurpation  of  govern- 
ment, for  a  denial  of  the  reserved  rights  of  the  States,  for  special  privi- 
leges and  favoritism,  for  artificial  but  temporary  and  uncertain  advan- 
tage to  the  few  and  not  service  to  the  many — shall  be  carried  by  assault 
and  then  razed  to  the  earth  never  to  arise  again. 


144  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

He  is  a  man  who  in  moral  action  is  bound  by  the  Ten  Command- 
ments; in  debate  by  dignity  and  decorum;  in  intercourse  by  gentleness 
and  candor;  in  victory  by  modesty  and  magnanimity;  in  action  by  pru- 
dence and  courage;  in  government  by  the  Constitution  and  the  law.  He 
can  counsel  without  haughtiness  and  reprove  without  scorn.  He  fears 
no  man  's  censure,  but  inspires  every  man 's  respect. 

Knowing  him  blameless  in  his  private  life;  invulnerable  in  his  record 
of  long  public  service,  imperturbable  in  action  and  impregnable  in  honor, 
Alabama  presents  for  the  Presidential  nomination  the  name  of  Democ- 
racy's real  leader  and  best  asset — Oscar  W.  Underwood.  [Applause.]

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  JAMES  A.  SEED. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Senator  Reed,  of  Missouri,  is  recog 
nized. 

MR.  KEEP,  of  Missouri: 

He  comes  from  Old  Missouri, 
The  land  of  corn  and  wine, 

Where  the  grapes  in  purple  glory- 
Cluster  thick  upon  the  vine; 

Where  the  cheeks  of  maids  blush  rosy 

As  the  apple  on  the  tree, 
And  the  people  quaintly  answer 

"You've  got  to  show  me."     [Applause.] 

Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the  Convention :  I  realize  that  1 
am  looking  into  the  faces  of  men  who  love  the  old  party;  who  believe  as 
I  believe,  that  when  the  flag  of  Democracy  shall  go  down  in  final  defeat, 
liberty  will  be  dead  upon  the  earth.  Begardless  of  what  others  may 
have  intimated,  I  unhesitatingly  say  that  I  am  willing  to  trust  the  honor 
of  the  Democracy  and  the  safety  of  this  Republic  to  your  consciences 
and  your  votes. 

SsOt.  Chairman,  we  are  here,  not  to  nominate  a  candidate,  but  to 
•qelect  a  President.  Today  we  shall  contend,  each  against  the  other; 
tomorrow  we  must  be  brothers  in  a  battle  for  humanity. 

Ours  is  a  high  privilege  and  solemn  duty.  It  should  be  met  in  a 
spirit  of  exalted  patriotism.  Every  consideration  must  be  subordinated 
to  the  great  cause  of  the  people.  We  speak  not  only  for  a  party,  but  for 
a  nation,  for  mankind  and  for  history. 

March  4,  1913,  we  will  dissolve  the  partnership  between  monopoly 
and  Government. 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  145 

Sixteen  years  this,  partnership  has  levied  tribute  under  the  forms  of 
law.  It  has  taxed  the  crust  upon  the  lips  of  hunger.  It  has  filched  from 
the  pockets  of  poverty. 

Monopoly  has  financed  the  campaigns  of  Republican  Presidents.  It 
has  been  rewarded  by  immunity  from  punishment  for  violation  of  the 
criminal  statutes.  The  people  turn  to  the  Democratic  party  for  relief. 

Republican  candidates  have  resorted  to  every  form  of  false  pretense, 
every  trick  of  demagoguery.  In  order  to  delude  the  people,  one  of  these 
candidates  has  not  hesitated  to  attack  the  courts  of  law,  and  to  assail  1ho 
fundamentals  of  our  Government. 

The  Democratic  party  asserts  that  the  Constitution  of  the  Fathers-- 
born  of  battle  and  pain,  baptized  in  blood  and  tears,  nurtured  in  wis 
dom  and  patience,  defended  by  bravery  and  sacrifice— shall  forever  be 

maintained.      \ 

_— * 

The  Constitution  was  created  by  the  people  for  the  protection  of  the 
liberties  of  the  people.  It  was  the  decree  of  man  asserting  his  sover- 
eignty. When  it  was  written,  the  shadow  of  despotism  rested  upon  every 
land.  Hereditary  monarchs  scourged  the  earth  with  fire  and  sword;  ex- 
ercised the  power  of  life  and  death,  and  enforced  their  decrees  by 
scaffold,  pillory  and  sword. 

Behold  now  the  marvelous  change!  The  fires  of  continental  liberty 
lighted  upon  our  shores  have  swept  'round  the  woild,  consuming  the 
citadels  of  arbitrary  power,  until  they  have  reached  the  throne  of  tin- 
Manclhis  and  the  seraglios  and  fortresses  of  the  Ottomans. 

The  principles  of  the  American  Constitution  will  soon  be  accepted 
as  the  fundamentals  of  all  civilized  Government. 

Beneath  its  protection,  America  has  marched  from  triumph  to  tri 
umph.  Half  a  continent  has  been  gained,  transformed  into  homes, 
enriched  with  cities,  glorified  with  temples  of  religion  and  seminaries  of 
learning,  and  peopled  by  the  greatest  race  of  men  who  have  lived  sinc«&gt; 
the  sun  first  kissed  the  horizon  of  time.  Beneath  our  Constitution,  aH 
have  been  secure — no  man  so  strong  he  did  not  need  its  shield;  no  wretch 
so  weak  he  might  not  find  refuge  under  its  provisions. 

It  has  survived  the  hatred  of  monarchs,  the  attacks  of  foreign  foes, 
the  horrors  of  fratricidal  strife;  it  will  continue  to  survive  all  assaults 

The  Democratic  party  has  always  been  the  friend  of  the  Constitution. 
Its  immortal  principles  were  first  blazed  into  the  night  of  tyranny  when 
the  hand  of  Thomas  Jefferson  held  aloft  the  Declaration  of  Independence. 

The  same  great  Democrat  insured  the  perpetuity  of  liberty  when  he 
wrote  the  Bill  of  Rights. 

The  Democratic  party  has  made  mistakes,  but  it  has  always  held  fast 
to  the  Constitution.  It  has  always  declared  that  free  government  must 
oe  a  government  of  law.  It  also  knows  that  he  who  assails  the  Consti- 
tution of  the  people,  even  though  he  has  twice  been  President,  is  none 
the  less  an  enemy  of  the  Republic  and  of  liberty. 

We  recognize  the  truth  that  all  laws  and  the  Constitution  itself  shouM 


146  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

when  necessary  be  amended  to  meet  changed  conditions.  But  \ve  refuse 
to  assail  the  structure  of  our  Government  or  to  incorporate  intellectual 
vagaries  and  fantrstic  experiments  into  our  jurisprudence. 

We  stand  for  government  by  law.  It  is  for  this  very  reason  we  insist 
that  the  law  against  illegal  combinations  must  be  rigorously  enforced. 

Under  Roosevelt  the  trusts  flourished  as  a  green  bay  tree;  under  Tafr 
the  tree  has  grown  and  spread  its  branches  until  their  shadow  covers 
all  the  land. 

Rocsevelt?s  policies  in  all  tl.e'r  fundamentals  have  been  perpetuated 
by  Taft.  If  either  is  elected,  these  policies  will  continue.  Yet  each 
loudly  proclaims  himself  a  progressive. 

The  necessity  for  progress  presuppcses  a  condition  so  bad  that  we 
must  run  from  it.  Taft  and  Roosevelt  are  responsible  for  present  condi- 
tions. The  cry  of  progress  upon  their  lips  is  a  confession  of  failure  and 
guilt. 

Recognizing  the  fact  that  the  people  condemn  their  official  acts, 
these  gentlemen  seek  to  shift  the  issue  from  a  comparison  of  perform- 
ances to  a  program  of  promises. 

The  Republican  contest  is  only  a  battle  between  the  great  interests. 
It  is  a  contest  of  syndicates. 

The  truth  is  at  last  manifest  and  Democracy  will  triumph. 

I  want  my  party  to  win,  but  I  want  it  to  win  more  than  an  office. 
I  would  have  it  win  because  it  stands  for  great  and  righteous  principles. 

I  want  it  to  meet  all  great  problems  in  patience,  in  fortitude,  in 
wisdom,  in  courage.  I  want  it  to  strike  with  an  iron  hand,  but  to 
strike  only  in  justice.  We  must  occupy  the  field  of  wise,  careful,  br-ivr 
statesmanship.  Our  policies  must  be  constructive  rather  than  destructive. 

Our  party  should  so  act  that  Democracy  shall  be  a  blessed  name  upon 
the  tongue  of  man. 

The  situation  is  epic.  The  contest  will  not  be  a  summer-day  t-x- 
cursion.  It  will  not  be  won  in  a  single  campaign.  Special  privilege 
is  entrenched;  its  emissaries  fill  high  places;  its  resources  are  incal- 
culable; its  allies  are  legion.  It  fights  to  retain  the  right  to  plunder  the 
greatest  nation  on  earth.  The  prize  is  enormous.  It  will  not  be  yielded 
without  the  most  desperate  resistance. 

Fronting  such  a  contest,  we  are  about  to  select  a  leader  to  whom 
we  must  entrust  the  party  and  the  national  honor.  I  want  that  leader 
to  be  a  man  who  in  every  impulse  of  heart  and  sentiment  of  soul  is 
devoted  to  the  cause  of  the  people.  I  would  select  a  Democratic  Bayard, 
who  stands  without  fear,  without  reproach,  without  taint  of  disloyalty . 

Half  of  every  battle  is  the  general.  No  army  of  men  ever  fought  well 
behind  a  leader  whose  loyalty  the  rank  and  file  doubted.  No  army  was 
ever  well  geaeraled  by  a  raw  recruit,  or  did  its  best  behind  a  novit-e  who 
tripped  upon  his  own  sword. 

In  such  a  struggle  as  lies  before  us,  give  me  for  a  leader  no  "sum- 
mer soldier  or  sunshine  patriot."  Give  me  no  political  dilettante,  who 


DEMOCRATIC  XATIOXAL  CONVKNTIOX  147 

comes  into  camp  when  honors  are  most  ripe  to  pluck.  I  want  no  half 
fledged  chanticleer  who  is  only  just  beginning  to  acquire  a  Democratic 
crow. 

Let  me  rather  have  for  general  him  who  has  suffered  the  hardships  of 
the  camp,  the  toi's  of  the  march,  the  dangers  of  the  field ;  who  has 
stood  at  the  bloody  angle;  who  has  proven  his  mettle  in  the  baptism 
of  fire. 

r^Let  me  tell  you  of  such  a  leader;  he  was  born  in  that  good  Dem« 
(•ratio.  State 

"Where  men  are  brave,   and   women  Are  fair, 
"And  the  sun  falls  bright  on  the  sward, 
"And   noble   daughters   and   loving   sons 
' '  Forever    keep    watch   and   ward : 
"The  land  of  Old  Kentucky." 

There  his  eyes  first  opened  to  behold  the  love-light  shining  in 
the  face  of  a  Democratic  mother.  Mingled  with  the  notes  of  her  lullaby, 
the  myriad  sounds  of  farm  life  were  borne  to  his  baby  ears.  About 
the  next  thing  he  heard  was  his  Democratic  father  reading  a  Democratic 
platform.  He  has  been  a  Democrat  ever  since.\ 

He  was  not  born  to  luxury.  He  sprung  from  that  stock  which  pro 
duced  the  men  who  subdued  the  West,  the  people  whose  hearts  are  in 
stim-t  with  patriotic  love  of  country  and  liberty. 

A  boy  of  tender  years,  he  began  the  struggle  of  life  for  himself.  It 
is  a  story  of  toils  and  achievement.  At  12  years  of  age,  he  was  earning 
his  living  clerking  in  a  grocery  store.  At  15,  he  was  teaching  in 
the  country  schools  of  his  native  State.  At  23  he  was  President  of 
Marshall  College,  West  Virginia. 

Two  years  later,  he  graduated'  with  distinction  from  the  Cincinnati 
School  of  Law.  He  paid  his  way  through  school,  and  earned  the  money 
by  the  hardest  kind  of  labor. 

As  a  lawyer,  he  rose  to  distinction.  The  same  habits  of  study  which 
had  marked  his  youth  characterized  his  professional  career.  In  point  of 
learning  he  is  the  equal  of  any  man  in  American  public  life.  There  if 
not  a  page  of  our  history  or  a  principle  of  our  Constitution  or  laws  with 
which  he  is  not  familiar. 

^This  man  sympathizes  with  the  common  people.  He  recognizes  the 
nobility  of  labor.  His  feet  have  felt  the  sharp  stones  of  adversity.  He 
loves  the  common  people  because  he  is  of  the  common  people.  He  has 
seen  them  labor  at  their  tasks,  and  has  bent  his  own  back  in  toil.  He 
looks  his  fellow-men  in  the  eyes  from  the  level.  You  do  not  need  to 
strain  your  neck  to  see  him.  He  has  never  ceased  to  love  the  common 
man;  he  lias  never  been  ashamed  of  his  early  poverty^^-A 

Let  me  quote  you  an  expression  from  his  own  lips,  delivered  in  the 
House  of  Representatives  in  August,  1911 : 


148  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

"Whenever  a  man  stands  up  and  undertakes  to  do  anything  for  the 
benefit  of  the  great  masses  of  the  people,  he  is  denounced  by  the  interests 
as  a  demagogue  and  is  charged  with  playing  politics.  But  to  stand  up 
and  advocate  the  cause  of  the  interests  is  the  highest  evidence  of  states- 
manship. As  far  as  I  am  individually  concerned,  I  sprang  from  the 
loins  of  the  common  people,  God  bless  them.  I  am  one  of  them.  I 
labored  with  my  hands  in  my  youth,  and  would  do  so  again  tomorrow. 
*  *  *  I  unhesitatingly  take  my  stand  with  the  consumers  of  the  land 
against  the  interests." 

We  hear  much  today  of  Progressives.  The  term  has  perhaps  never 
been  clearly  defined.  But  if  you  mean  by  a  progressive  one  who  studies 
conditions,  and,  recognizing  an  evil,  bravely  seeks  for  and  applies  a 
remedy,  then  I  assert  that  this  man  has  a  record  unsurpassed. 

He  does  not  cling  to  a  thing  simply  because  it  is  hoary  with  ago. 
Neither  will  be  embrace  an  idea  only  because  it  is  new.  He  is  conserva- 
tive enough  to  believe  that  nothing  should  be  destroyed  merely  because 
it  has  lasted  a  long  time.  He  is  progressive  enough  not  to  reject  an  idea 
simply  because  it  is  not  covered  with  the  mildew  of  antiquity.  He  would 
destroy  the  evil,  but  he  will  not  strike  down  the  good.  He  would  not 
dynamite  a  house  because  one  room  is  insanitary.  He  would  sink  every 
pirate  craft  sailing  the  commercial  seas,  but  he  will  save  every  honest 
vessel. 

He  believes  that  all  changes  demand  sober  consideration,  but  he 
recognizes  that  changing  conditions  demand  changes  in  laws,  and  that 
wise  statesmanship  embraces  the  idea  of  steady  and  consistent  progression. 

I  challenge  attention  to  his  record: 

He  does  not  come  with  promises  upon  his  lips,  but  with  achievements 
in  his  hands. 

When  other  men  beheld  the  rising  power  of  financial  combination, 
but  stood  inactive  and  appalled,  his  clear  vision  not  only  saw  the  danger, 
but  applied  the  remedy.  He  drew  the  first  and  most  stringest  anti-trust 
statute  ever  enacted  in  the  United  States.  It  has  stood  the  test  of  all 
the  courts,  and  become  the  model  for  other  States  to  follow. 

Twenty-four  years  ago  he  placed  upon  the  statute  books  of  his  State 
a  law  guarding  the  secrets  of  the  ballot. 

He  advocated  the  direct  primary  system  twenty  years  ago;  and  ap- 
plied it  in  his  Congressional  District. 

It  is  thirteen  years  since  he  contended  for  the  enactment  of  the 
most  rigid  corrupt  practice  act  to  be  found  upon  the  statute  books. 

Five  years  ago  he  stood  for  the  initiative  and  referendum  in  his  own 
State.  He  was  not,  as  some  others  are,  disturbed  lest  the  people  should 
destroy  themselves. 

As  early  as  1885  he  declared  for  the  direct  election  of  Senators. 
Five  times  has  he  voted  for  that  measure,  and  for  years  in  Congress  has 
been  its  distinguished  advocate. 


DEMOCRATIC   \\TIO\AL  COXVKNTION  149 

During  all  of  his  long  public  service,  he  has  been  one  of  the  most 
valiant  champions  of  tariff  reform. 

I  place  before  you  this  record,  made  not  when  lust  of  office  lures,  but 
written  in  the  story  of  the  years,  and  graven  upon  the  public  statute.-! 
of  the  country ;  and  I  challenge  comparison. 

It  is  not  a  record  of  protestation  and  promises,  of  faith  without 
works;  but  it  is  a  record  of  performance,  of  faith  crystallized  into  acts. 

All  his  life  this  man  has  been  a  Democrat.  He  has  not  been  an 
occasional  Democrat.  He  does  not  belong  to  that  class  of  Democrats 
who  steal  out  o'  nights,  sleep  in  strange  political  beds,  and  then  come 
trailing  home  about  the  time  they  can  smell  the  breakfast  bacon  frying. 

He  is  not  a  fair-weather  soldier.  He  has  marched  in  the  procession 
when  there  was  no  band  to  lead.  He  did  not  enlist  for  one  campaign ; 
he  volunteered  for  life. 

Forty  years  ago,  he  cast  his  first  ballot.  He  has  voted  the  Demo- 
cratic ticket  ever  since,  and  voted  it  straight.  He  has  done  so,  not  from 
prejudice  of  opinion,  or  servility  of  mind,  but  because  he  knew  that 
notwithstanding  all  mistakes,  all  blunders  and  all  shortcomings,  the 
Democratic  party  was,  and  is,  the  one  single  force  standing  to  defend 
the  Temple  of  Liberty  and  Equality. 

In  every  campaign  from  1872  to  the  present  hour  this  soldier  has 
been  in  every  battle.  He  has  never  removed  his  uniform,  laid  down  his 
sword,  or  quit  the  field. 

In  the  great  campaign  of  1896,  when  desertion 'thinned  our  ranks  and 
disaster  engulfed  our  hopes,  he  helped  to  raise  our  banner  on  the  stricken 
field,  and  stood  with  those  who  cried,  "Courage!  Courage!  Justice  is  im- 
mortal! Courage,  Soldiers  of  the  Democracy!  Gird  up  your  loins  fov 
battles  yet  to  come-" 

I  saw  him  then,  grim,  determined,  undismayed.  I  heard  his  clarion 
voice  ring  forth  without  a  single  note  of  fear. 

I  saw  him  upon  other  fields,  when  days  were  dark  and  the  long  years, 
heaping  disaster  upon  disaster,  brought  despair  to  many  a  stout  and 
loyal  heart;  and  yet  there  does  not  live  a  man  who  ever  saw  him  quit 
his  post  or  waver  in  the  fight. 

Always  and  ever  his  face  has  been  fair-fronted  to  the  foe;  always  and 
ever  his  cry  has  been,  ' '  Close  ranks,  and  Forward ! ' ' 

What  wonder  that  party  leadership  came,  and  with  it  party  victory! 

We  had  passed  through  dark  days.  The  election  of  1904  left  us  with- 
out control  of  a  single  State  Legislature  north  of  Mason  and  Dixon  's 
line.  In  all  that  vast  territory  there  was  but  one  Democratic  Governor. 
Our  representation  in  Congress  had  dwindled  to  a  pitiable  minority. 

Nineteen  hundred  and  eight  found  some  improvement,  but  the  situa- 
tion was  yet  disheartening  and  desperate.  The  people  had  come  to  regard 
us  as  a  mere  opposition  party,  without  cohesion  or  policy.  Our  forces 
had  ceased  to  be  potential. 

After  the  election  of  1908,  the  Democratic  Congressmen  selected  the 


150  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

man  whom  I  shall  name  for  minority  leader.  In  fourteen  months  ot 
time,  the  new  leader  wrought  marvelous  change.  The  iron  grip  of 
Cannon  was  broken.  It  was  the  beginning;  "after  that,  the  deluge." 

With  the  authority  to  command,  he  never  issued  an  order.  ,11  e 
preferred  counsel  to  decrees.  He  called  his  associates  together,  ami 
listened  to  their  opinions.  He  manifested  that  high  statesmanship  which 
unites  discordant  elements  and  inspires  them  with  a  common  purpose. 

The  Payne- Aldrich  iniquity  was  forced  through  Congress,  but  no! 
as  similar  bills  had  been  enacted.  The  feeble  opposition  of  a  disunited 
minority  had  given  place  to  the  fire,  vigor  and  courage  which  contests 
every  inch  of  ground,  and  gains  strength  .from  each  defeat.  When  that 
struggle  was  over,  the  Republican  party  had  been  unmasked,  its  breach  of 
faith  demonstrated. 

Towering  above  all  others  in  that  historic  fight  was  the  great  minority 
leader.  I  can  see  him  yet,  cool,  collected,  relentless,  the  light  of  battle 
flashing  from  his  gray  eyes,  his  square  jaw  rigid  with  determi nation, 
as  he  advanced  to  the  Speaker's  chair.  I  can  hear  his  challenge: 

' '  Mr.  Chairman:  Payne  says  that  he  and  his  cohorts  will  meet  us  in  No- 
vember. *  *  *  itfy  Democratic  Brethren,  at  last,  after  hard  trials 
and  great  tribulations,  thank  God.  we  stand  here  shoulder  to  shoulder, 
heart  to  heart,  solid  f.s  a  stone  wall,  inspired  by  the  hopes  of  coming 
victory.  *  *  *  My  Republican  Friends,  you  will  meet  us  in  Novem- 
ber because  you  cannot  help  yourselves.  And  when  you  do  meet  us.  you 
will  receive  the  bloodiest  defeat  you  have  had  since  1892.  Up,  Guards, 
and  at  them ! ' ' 

That  challenge  became  the  real  issue  of  the  campaign  of  1910.  Upon 
that  issue  we  changed  a  Republican  majority  in  the  House  of  Representa- 
tives of  38  to  a  Democratic  majority  of  69;  a  Republican  Senatorial 
majority  of  26  dwindled  to  9.  It  was  not  a  battle ;  it  was  a  revolution — 
a  revolution  in  the  pivotal  States. 

It  was  gained  in  the  very  States  which  we  must  win  if  we  elect  a 
President. 

The  man  who  made  that  issue  retains  the  confidence  of  the  people 
of  those  great  pivotal  States.  His  popularity  is  confined  to  no  section.  In 
his  campaign  he  hcs  remained  qu:etly  at  his  post  of  duty.  He  has  not 
afforded  the  spectacle  of  a  Presidential  candidate  clamorously  parading 
the  country  with  brass  bands  and  red  lights,  soliciting  votes.  He  did  not 
need  to.  He  had  made  so  many  speeches  for  his  party  it  was  unnecessary 
to  make  any  for  himself. 

His  campaign  has  been  made  by  the  people  for  him.  It  has  beei: 
conducted  almcst  without  money  and  without  organization.  Yet,  you 
can  march  across  this  continent  .from  the  extreme  East  to  the  d'stant 
West,  and  from  our  northern  border  to  our  southern  line,  and  not  set  foot 
on  territory  that  is  not  loyal  to  his  cause. 

He  counts  in  his  column  substantially  all  of  the  delegates  of  twenty 
two  sovereign  States.  His  j  oj  ularity  has  svve[  t  across  the  s:-a.  ami 


DEMOCRATIC   NATIONAL  COXVKXTIOX  151 

l:i&gt;  will  I:.-  supported  lore  on  every  luillot  Ity  sulistantially  all  of  the  dele- 
yiites  from  the  Territorial  and  Jnsuhir  possessions. 

He  carried  his  own  State  by  a  unanimous  vote.  He  carried  every 
State  touching  its  borders.  He  carried  the  States  touching  borders  with 
the  home  States  of  his  distinguished  opponents.  He  carried  almost 
solidly  that  great  domain  known  as  the  .Middle  West.  With  two  excep- 
tions he  swept  all  States  west  of  the  Rocky  Mountains. 

I  have  said  he  carried  thes3  States;  let  me  rather  say,  the  loyal 
Democracy,  the  Democracy  that  has  never  faltered,  that  has  with  un- 
wavering allegiance  followed  the  flag,  carried  them  for  him. 

What  are  the  great  issues  upon  which  we  must  fight  the  battle  Oi' 
1912?  Is  it  not  upon  the  record  made  by  the  Democratic  House  of  Repre- 
sentatives? That  record  is  a  story  of  promises  redeemed-,  and  pledges 
kept ;  of  patient,  wise,  brave  statesmanship. 

Over  the  deliberations  of  that  body  he  has  presided.  He  brought 
to  the  office  the  wisdom  of  experience,  and  a  judgment  ripened  by 
long  and  close  contact  with  the  problems  of  government. 

I  would  not  detract  a  hair 's  weight  from  the  honors  due  to  all 
Democratic  Congressmen.  I  would  not  pluck  a  single  leaf  from  the  brow 
of  the  present  great  majority  leader.  I  give  to  all  due  meed  of  praise. 
But  yet  I  say,  here  is  the  real  leader.  Here  is  the  man  who  most  of 
all  has  borne  the  burdens  and  responsibilities,  whose  counsel  has 
guided,  who  pointed  the  way;  whose  keen  intellect,  superb  courage, 
and  masterly  generalship  have  forged  the  force  which  has  been  driven 
like  a  wedge  .through  the  body  of  the  Republican  party  and  split  it 
asunder. 

The  army  of  the  Democracy  is  forming  in  battle  array.  The  sun 
of  hope  glorifies  the  horizon  of  the  future,  and  sheds  its  splendor  upon 
our  banners.  Above  us  bends  the  myriad-hued  bow  of  promise.  We  have 
been  brought  to  the  very  gates  of  success  by  a  veteran.  Let  him  con- 
tinue to  lead,  and  the  celestial  bow  will  become  an  arch  of  triumph, 
beneath  which  Democracy  will  march  in  glorious  victory. 

I  I  nominate  this  man,  who  has  fought  a  thousand  battles  for  Democ- 
racy and  not  one  against  her;  who  has  never  lowered  his  flag  or  asked  for 
quarter ;  who  has  neither  deserted  nor  taken  a  furlough ;  who  does  not 
know  how  to  quit  a  friend  or  betray  a  party ;  whose  back  the  enemy  has 
never  seen,  but  whose  breast  is  covered  with  the  scars  of  honor ;  who 
leads  today  and  who  should  lead  tomorrow — the  Lion  of  Democracy, 
Champ  Clark,  of  Missouri.^ 

The  secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

The  State  of  Arkansas  was  called. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  James  K.  Vardaman,  of  Miss'ssippi,  in 
the  chair)  :  It  is  my  pleasure  to  present  to  you  Governor-elect  Robin- 
son, of  Arkansas,  who  will  now  address  you. 


15'2  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

SPEECH   OF   JOE   T.   ROBINSON. 

MR.  JOE  T.  ROBIXSOX,  of  Arkansas:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
•  of  the  Convention,  the  nation  looks  hopefully  to  this  convention.  Demo- 
cratic success  in  the  coming  election  may  be  measured  in  part  by  the 
wisdom  we  exemplify.  Victory  will  be  assured  by  choosing  a  candidate 
who  is  acceptable  to  all  loyal  Democrats  and  not  needlessly  repugnant 
to  those  of  other  parties  who  are  willing  to  support  the  Democratic 
ticket.  [Applause.] 

The  probabilities  of  victory  have  not  impelled  any  Democratic  candi- 
date for  the  presidential  nomination  to  intemperate  speech  or  bitter  de- 
nunciation. For  this  they  are  all  to  be  commended.  Billingsgate  can 
aever  become  the  chief  argument  of  a  Democrat  who  is  worthy  to  be 
president.  The  Marquis  of  Queensberry  rules  and  the  vernacular  of  the 
prize  ring,  applicable  to  latter  day  Republican  campaigns  and  conven- 
tions, have  no  place  here.  [Applause.] 

Acknowledging  the  splendid  ability  and  efficient  services  of  many 
Democrats  who  are  worthy  of  the  high  honor,  still  in  choosing  our  candi- 
date it  is  expedient  to  recognize  all  honorable  considerations  which  we 
know  will  influence  the  voters  to  whom  we  must  appeal.  Neither  fac- 
tional difference  nor  selfish  motive  should  influence  our  choice.  The 
nation 's  welfare  and  the  party 's  success  must  be  constantly  kept  in 
view.  [Applause.] 

The  Democrats  of  Arkansas  have  commissioned  me  to  the  pleasant 
task  of  seconding  the  nomination  of  damp  Clark  of  Missouri.-  [Ap- 
plause.] His  progressive,  Democratic  spirit  is  exemplified  in  his  public 
utterances  when  he  said: 

' '  No  man  is  fit  to  be  the  lawgiver  for  a  mighty  people  who  yields  to 
the  demands  and  solicitations  of  the  few  who  have  access  to  his  ear  and 
is  forgetful  of  the  vast  multitude  who  may  never  hear  his  voice  nor 
look  into  h's  face." 

"Our  chief  reliance  for  success  is  to  give  to  the  people  such  a  record 
for  honest,  intelligent,  courageous,  constructive  and  progressive  states- 
manship as  to  convince  the  country  beyond  the  shadow  of  a  doubt  that 
we  are  worthy  of  the  continued  and  enlarged  confidence  of  the  public. ' ' 

In  expending  the  public  money,  he  says: 

"We  should  remember  that  we  are  trustees  of  a  trust  fund,  and 
we  have  no  right  to  squander  the  public  money. ' ' 

"The  overshadowing  issue  will  be  the  tariff  question  and  the  cognate 
question  of  the  trusts.  The  tariff  ought  to  be  reduced  to  a  revenue 
basis,  and  laws  against  trusts,  in  both  their  criminal  and  civil  features, 
should  be  rigorously  enforced  without  fear  or  favor. ' ' 

"The  Republicans  who  believe  the  tariff  should  be  revised  only  by 
jts  friends  also  advocate  that  the  trusts  should  be  prosecuted  bv  their 
friends." 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  153 

"The  welfare  of  the  nation  and  the  success  of  the  Democratic  party 
are  paramount  to  my  promotion."  [Applause.] 

Are  not  these  sentiments  expressive  of  genuine  Democratic  principles 
and  sympathies?  Mr.  Clark  has  earned  and  enjoys  the  full  confidence 
of  his  countrymen.  His  right  to  promotion  is  based  on  long  continued, 
faithful  public  service.  [Applause.] 

The  confidence  of  his  associates  in  Congress,  manifested  by  his  elec- 
tion to  the  Speakership  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  has  been  justi- 
fied by  the  restoration,  under  his  leadership,  of  complete  harmony  among 
Democrats,  and  the  overthrow  of  Cannonism.  This  achievement — the 
destruction  of  arbitrary  power  which  assumed  to  stifle  the  voice  of  the 
people  and  chain  the  hands  of  their  representatives — marked  the  most 
substantial,  beneficial  triumph  that  has  crowned  Democracy  in  the  last 
half  century.  [Applause.] 

Let  us  counsel  together  and  choose  as  our  candidate  one  of  high 
character  and  unquestioned  ability,  whose  candidacy  will  unify  Demo- 
crats, and  without  compromise  of  principle  attract  independent  and  dis- 
affected Republican  votes.  Let  us  select  a  leader  who  has  always  been 
loyal  to  the  cause  of  the  people,  liberal,  broadminded,  cautious  and 
patriotic;  a  Democrat  of  unfaltering  faith  and  undoubted  integrity; 
one  who  has  never  bolted,  but  who  has  uniformly  supported  Democratic 
platforms  and  nominees. 

Such  a  man  is  Champ  Clark  of  Missouri.  [Applause.]  He  comes 
from  the  very  heart  and  center  of  the  union.  His  integrity  has  re- 
mained unquestioned,  his  good  name  unsullied  through  more  than  a 
quarter  of  a  century  of  faithful  public  service.  He  is  a  warrior  who 
has  always  pitched  his  tent  in  the  midst  of  the  hosts  of  Israel.  He 
has  never  broken  bread  at  the  enemy's  table  nor  sought  shelter  in  his 
camp.  A  great  opportunity  awaits  the  Democratic  party.  This  oppor- 
tunity is  for  the  overthrow  of  corruption  and  the  restoration  of  power 
and  liberty  to  the  people.  [Applause.] 

I  am  commissioned  by  the  unanimous  vote  of  the  delegates  from 
Arkansas  in  this  Convention  to  second  the  nomination  of  Champ  Clark, 
of  Missouri.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll.

MB.  THEODORE  A.  BELL,  of  California  (when  the  State  of  California 
was  called) :  Mr.  Chairman,  California  seconds  the  nomination  of

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  WILLIAM  KENNEDY,  of  Connecticut  (when  the  State  of  Connecti- 
cut was  called) :  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Henry  W.  Rogers,  of  New  Haven, 
will  present  to  this  Convention  Connecticut's  choice  for  President.  [Ap- 
plause.] 


154  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (MB.  YARDAMAX,  of  Mississippi,  in  the 
Chair)  :  The  Chair  presents  to  the  Convention  Hon.  Henry  Wade  Rogers, 
of  Connecticut.  [Applause.] 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  HENRY  WADE  ROGERS. 

MR.  ROGERS,  of  Connecticut:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  I  rise  on  behalf  of  my  State  to  urge  the  Convention  to 
place  in  nomination  for  the  high  office  of  President  of  the  United  States 
the  Democratic  Governor  of  Connecticut,  Simeon  E.  Baldwin.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

Connecticut  for  the  second  time  in  its  history  is  urging  upon  the 
National  Convention  of  the  Democratic  party  the  nomination  of  a  Con- 
necticut man  for  the  Presidency.  Two  score  and  four  years  ago,  in 
1868,  Connecticut  proposed  the  name  of  the  then  Democratic  Governor 
of  the  State,  but  the  Convention  nominated  the  Governor  of  New  York, 
Horatio  Seymour,  who  went  eown  to  defeat  in  the  election  which  ensued. 

Connecticut  now  again  asks  that  in  the  course  of  your  deliberations 
you  weigh  well  the  merits  and  availability  of  the  man  she  advises  you 
to  nominate.  We  have  organized  no  bureaus,  and  we  have  sent  forth  no 
emissaries  to  manufacture  sentiment  in  his  favor  in  other  States.  He 
himself  lias  entered  into  no  alliances,  made  no  effort  on  his  own  behalf, 
but  has  borne  himself  as  did  the  elder  statesmen  of  the  Republic,  who 
thought  tie  office  was  neither  to  be  sought  nor  declined.  [Applause.] 

Connecticut  is  of  little  territorial  consequence  in  the  vast  empire  that 
spans  this  continent.  But  small  though  she  is,  she  is  larger  than  little 
Attica  out  of  which  came  the  great  law-givers,  philosophers,  poets  and 
orators  of  the  ancient  world.  Her  population  is  small  as  well  as  her 
territory,  but  it  exceeds  the  combined  population  of  the  five  western 
States  of  Idaho,  Montana,  Nevada,  Utah  and  Wyoming.  Connecticut 
does  not  cast  a  large  vote  in  the  Electoral  College,  but  as  Connecticut 
has  voted  so  has  gone  the  Union.  But  once  since  1856  has  the  candidate 
for  the  Presidency  who  has  carried  Connecticut  failed  to  carry  the 
country.  That  one  exception  was  in  1888,  when  that  great  Democrat, 
Grover  Cleveland,  carried  Connecticut  and  lost  the  presidency.  In  1876 
Hayes  lost  Connecticut,  and  another  great  Democrat,  Tilden,  carried  it. 
But  that  constituted  no  exception,  for  Tilden  carried  the  country  and 
Hayes  was  never  elected  President.  [Applause.]  He  was  simply  counted 
in  by  the  carpet  bag  canvassing  boards  of  Florida,  Louisiana  and  South 
Carolina,  who  stole  the  Presidency  from  Samuel  J.  Tilden.  The  experi- 
ences of  sixty  years,  therefore,  confront  you.  It  shows  that  if  you  can 
tell  what  Connecticut  thinks  and  how  Connecticut  will  vote  you  can  tell 
what  the  country  thinks  and  how  the  country  will  vote.  Connecticut 
wants  you  to  nominate  the  man  whose  name  I  propose;  and  if  you  nomi- 
nate him  you  will  carry  Connecticut  and  carry  the  country  and  win  the 
Presidency.  [Applause.] 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  155 

We  meet  in  Baltimore  on  the  Democratic  party's  historic  ground. 
Prior  to  1804  here  were  held  with  one  exception  all  the  national  con- 
ventions of  our  party.  Jackson  was  nominated  here,  and  here  we  nomi- 
nated Van  Buren,  Polk  and  Pierce.  In  recent  years  our  conventions 
have  been  held  elsewhere.  But  this  year  we  return  to  Baltimore  and 
at  a  time  when  the  Convention  is  master  of  a  supreme  opportunity. 
Once  again  we  will  name  in  this  city  the  next  President  of  the  Unitnl 
States. 

The  Democrats  of  the  United  States  have  sent  their  representatives 
to  this  Convention  to  nominate  as  the  candidate  of  our  party  for  Presi- 
dent in  1912  a  man  of  the  highest  character,  of  brilliant  intellect,  of 
integrity  without  a  flaw,  the  firmness  of  whose  fibre  and  the  strength  of 
whose  purpose  cannot  be  questioned;  one  who  is  experienced  in  public 
affairs,  and  versed  in  the  law  of  nations,  and  who  knows  the  powers, 
duties  and  prerogatives  of  the  State  and  National  Governments. 

The  Democrats  want  us  to  nominate  a  man  who  knows  and  will 
respect  the  limitations  which  the  Constitution  imposes  upon  the  exercise 
of  arbitrary  power.  They  want  us  to  nominate  a  man  who  knows  the 
straight  and  narrow  path  marked  out  by  the  Constitution  and  who  will 
walk  therein.  They  want  us  to  nominate  a  man  who  will  maintain 
against  all  the  world  the  stable  structure  of  our  Government  as  estab- 
lished by  the  fathers.  They  want  us  to  nominate  a  man  who  believes  in 
the  supremacy  of  law  and  in  the  independence  of  the  judiciary  and  who 
will  resist  all  measures  which  would  degrade  the  judicial  tribunals  and 
impair  the  confidence  and  respect  of  the  people  in  their  courts.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

They  want  us  to  nominate  a  man  who  is  old-fashioned  enough  to 
believe  in  the  principles  which  have  made  the  United  States  great,  pros- 
perous, and  honored,  but  who,  at  the  same  time,  is  progressive  enough 
to  believe  in  the  new  methods  and  policies  made  necessary  by  the  changed 
conditions  of  the  country. 

Do  you  ask  me  whether  my  candidate  is  a  Progressive  Democrat? 
My  reply  is  that  he  has  voted  twice  for  William  Jennings  Bryan  for 
President ;  that  he  favors  the  election  of  United  States  Senators  by  direct 
vote  of  the  people;  that  he  has  advocated  the  extension  of  municipal 
suffrage  to  women,  and  such  progressive  legislation  as  the  Workingmen's 
Compensation  Acts.  [Applause.] 

The  Democrats  of  the  United  States  want  us  to  nominate  a  man 
who  believes  that  a  revision  of  the  tariff  downwards  is  essential;  one 
who  knows  that  the  Payne-Aldrich  law  is  not  the  best  but  the  worst 
tariff  law  the  country  ever  had;  [Applause]  a  masterpiece  of  injustice, 
inequality,  and  false  pretense,  impoverishing  the  many  to  subsidize  the 
few  and  increasing  the  cost  of  living  beyond  the  endurance  of  the  people. 
[Applause.] 

They  want  us  to  nominate  a  man  who,  while  protecting  the  corpora- 
tions in  their  just  rights  and  legitimate  interests,  will  at  the  same  time 


156  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

exercise  all  his  constitutional  power  to  control  dangerous  combinations 
of  capital  which  threaten  the  prosperity  of  the  American  people. 

They  want  us  to  nominate  a  man  who  can  command  public  confidence 
in  his  good  sense  and  in  his  ability  to  deal  intelligently  with  the  prob-« 
lems  of  the  Government. 

They  want  us  to  nominate  a  man  who  can  bring  the  Government 
back  to  the  ideals  of  Washington,  Jefferson,  Jackson,  and  Lincoln. 
[Applause.] 

The  man  who  has  in  full  measure  the  splendid  qualifications  I  have 
named  is  the  present  Governor  of  Connecticut.  [Applause.]  No  man 
in  the  paity  is  his  superior  in  conscience  or  in  brain,  or  more  in  sympathy 
with  the  just  aspirations  of  the  people.  Nominate  him  and  you  cannot 
be  defeated.  Nominate  him  and  the  men  of  business  and  the  sons  of 
toil  and  the  whole  great  Democratic  host  will  make  him  President. 
Nominate  him  and  your  appeal  to  the  intelligent  judgment  of  the  Ameri- 
can people  will  not  be  in  vain.  [Applause.] 

We  present  him  to  you  as  a  great  man  who  represents  all  that  is 
best  in  the  intellectual  and  moral  life  of  New  England,  and  of  the 
country.  He  comes  of  Puritan  stock.  In  his  veins  flows  the  blood  of 
Boger  Sherman,  a  signer  of  the  Declaration  of  Independence,  as  well  as 
a  signer  of  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  which  he  helped  to 
frame. 

The  candidate  Connecticut  proposes  is  one  of  the  eminent  jurists  of 
our  day.  He  has  filled  with  great  distinction  the  office  of  Chief  Justice 
of  Connecticut.  He  has  won  renown  at  the  bar  and  been  the  president 
of  the  American  Bar  Association.  His  fame  is  more  than  national.  It 
is  international.  He  has  been  president  of  the  International  Law  Asso- 
ciation, and  as  such  has  presided  in  Europe  over  that  body  of  eminent 
international  lawyers  gathered  from  all  countries. 

That  he  is  a  man  who  has  been  interested  in  the  highest  things  and 
eminent  in  more  than  one  field  you  may  knew  by  the  fact  that  he  has 
been  president  of  the  American  Social  Science  Association,  and  of  the 
American  Historical  Association.  The  oldest  of  American  Universities 
years  ago  conferred  upon  him  its  highest  honors  and  made  him  a  Doctor 
of  Laws.  He  is  now  the  Democratic  Governor  of  Connecticut,  and  the 
only  Democratic  Governor  our  State  has  had  in  twenty  years.  He  is  a 
great  scholar,  a  great  lawyer,  a  great  judge,  a  great  Democrat,  and 
above  all  a  Christian  gentleman.  His  private  character  is  spotless.  His 
public  character  is  invulnerable.  Nominate  him  and  there  can  be  no 
ammunition  of  calumny  that  can  be  exploded.  Nominate  him  and  no 
shafts  and  arrows  can  be  aimed  at  him,  or,  if  there  should  be,  they  will 
not  be  able  to  pierce  his  breast-plate.  They  will  all  lie  broken  and 
harmless  at  his  feet.  [Applause.] 

Do  you  ask  whether  our  candidate  is  too  advanced  in  years  to  render 
valuable  public  service!  We  answer  that  men  many  years  his  junior 
covet  his  vigor  of  body  and  mind,  and  that  those  who  know  him  have  no

fear  lest  his  strength  should  prove  unequal  to  the  burdens  of  the  Presi- 
dency. Gladstone  was  made  Prime  Minister  of  the  British  Empire 
when  he  was  a  dozen  years  his  senior. 

Do  you  ask  whether  he  lias  been  so  identified  with  party  factions  as 
to  impair  his  strength  and  make  it  difficult  for  a  united  party  to  support 
him?  We  answer  that  his  position  on  the  bench  withdrew  him  from  all 
factional  differences  which  in  former  years  divided  the  party,  and  that 
there  is  no  man  upon  whom  all  can  more  easily  unite.  [Applause.] 

Not  only  does  the  blood  of  Boger  Sherman  course  through  his  veins, 
but  the  spirit  of  Roger  Sherman  animates  him  and  he  is  the  embodiment 
of  that  sound  practical  sense  which  characterized  the  man  from  whom 
he  is  descended,  the  great  law-giver  and  constructor  of  governments.  He 
is  a  statesman  by  inheritance.  His  father  was  twice  elected  governor 
of  our  State  and  represented  Connecticut  with  distinction  in  the  Senate 
in  the  days  of  Webster,  Clay  and  Calhoun.  [Applause.] 

Connecticut  has  sent  us  to  this  Convention  to  say  to  the  representa- 
tives of  the  Democratic  party  gathered  in  council  from  all  the  States  and 
Territories  of  the  Union  to  conserve  the  interests  of  the  Republic,  nomi- 
nate for  President  Simeon  E.  Baldwin,  and  he  will  lift  again  the  banner 
of  the  Democratic  party  and  carry  it  forward  to  such  a  victory  as  our 
party  has  not  won  in  a  generation.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  WILLIAM  H.  STEVENS,  of  Delaware  (when  the  State  of  Delaware 
was  called)  :  Delaware  yields  to  New  Jersey. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  presents  to  the  Convention 
Judge  John  W.  Wescott,  of  New  Jersey.  [Applause.] 


NOMINATING   SPEECH   OF   JOHN   W.   WESCOTT. 

MR.  JOHN  W.  WESCOTT,  of  N.  J. :  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen, 
New  Jersey,  once  bound,  but,  by  the  moral  energy  and  intellectual 
greatness  of  a  single  soul  now  free,  comes  to  this  historic  convention, 
in  the  glory  of  her  emancipation,  to  participate  in  your  deliberations,  aid 
in  formulating  your  judgments  and  assist  in  executing  your  decrees. 
The  New  Jersey  delegation  is  in  no  sense  empowered  to  exercise  the 
attributes  of  proprietorship.  |0n  the  wreck  and  ruin  of  a  bi-partisan 
machine  a  master  hand  has  erected  an  ideal  Commonwealth  in  less  than 
two  years.  [Applause.]  New  Jersey  is  free.  Therefore,  the  New 
Jersey  delegation  is  commissioned  to  represent  the  great  cause  of 
Democracy  and  to  offer,  as  its  militant  and  triumphant  leader,  a 
scholar,  not  a  charlatan;  a  statesman,  not  a  doctrinaire;  a  profound 
lawyer,  not  a  splitter  of  legal  hairs;  a  political  economist,  not  an 
egotistical  theorist;  a  practical  politician,  who  constructs,  modifies, 
restrains  without  disturbance  or  destruction ;  a  resistless  debater  and 
consummate  master  of  statement,  not  a  mere  phrase-maker;  a  humani- 
tarian, not  a  defamer  of  characters  and  lives;  a  man  whose  mind  is 


158  OFFICIAL    PROCEEDINGS    OF    TI1K 

at  once  cosmopolitan  and  composite  of  all  America;  a  gentleman  of 
unpretentious  habits,  with  the  fear  of  God  in  his  heart  and  the  love 
of  mankind  exhibited  in  every  act  of  his  life  [applause] ;  above  all  a 
public  servant  who  has  been  tried  to  the  uttermost  and  never  found . 
wanting — peerless,  matchless,  unconquerable  in  the  performance  of  his 
duty,  the  ultimate  Democrat,  the  genius  of  liberty  and  the  very  incarna- 
tion of  progress.^  [Applause.] 

New  Jersey  has  reasons  for  her  course.  Let  us  not  be  deceived  in  the 
essentials  of  the  premises  upon  which  this  convention  will  build,  if  it 
builds  successfully.  Campaigns  of  villification,  corruption  and  false 
pretense  have  lest  their  usefulness.  The  evolution  of  national  energy 
is  toward  a  more  intelligent  morality  in  politics  and  in  all  other  rela- 
tions. [Applause.]  The  line  of  cleavage  is  between  those  who  treat 
politics  as  a  game  and  those  who  regard  it  as  the  serious  business  of 
government.  The  realignment  of  political  parties  will  be  on  this  prin- 
ciple. The  situation  admits  of  no  dispute  and  no  compromise.  The 
temper  and  purpose  of  the  American  people  will  tolerate  no  other  view. 
The  indifference  of  the  American  public  to  its  politics  has  disappeared. 
Any  platform,  and  any  candidate  on  that  platform,  not  fully  responsive 
to  this  vast  social,  political  and  economical  behest  will  go  down  to 
ignominious  defeat  at  the  polls.  [Applause.]  Platforms  are  too  often 
mere  historic  rubbish  heaps  of  broken  promises.  Candidates  are  too 
often  the  unfortunate  creatures  of  arrangements  and  calculations. 
Exigencies,  conditions,  national  needs  and  necessities  make  better  plat- 
forms and  produce  greater  leaders  than  does  the  exercise  of  proprietor- 
ship. [Applause.]  Hence  it  is  that  a  disregard  of  the  premises  will 
bring  our  dreams  crashing  in  ruins  next  November. 

Again  the  eternal  conflict  between  equal  opportunity  and  special 
privilege  is  upon  us.  Our  fathers  wrote  the  issue  of  that  struggle  in 
our  Constitutions.  They  declared  all  men  to  be  free  and  equal.  In  a 
single  century  that  principle  developed  the  North  American  continent, 
leavened  the  wo'rld  with  its  beneficence,  inspired  all  nations  with  hope 
and  made  the  United  States  the  asylum  of  all  mankind.  [Applause.] 
Yet  America,  at  this  very  hour,  presents  the  most  stupendous  contradic- 
tion in  history — a  people  politically  free,  while  economically  bound  by 
the  most  gigantic  monopolies  of  all  time,  and  burdened  with  a  system 
of  taxation  which  exploits  millions  to  enrich  a  few.  We  have  preserved 
the  forms  of  freedom,  but  are  fast  losing  its  substance. 

The  evils  of  this  condition  are  felt  in  a  thousand  ways  throughout 
the  land.  Therefore  it  is  that  America  is  awake.  Therefore  it  is  that 
a  mistake  in  our  premises  will  be  fatal.  Therefore  it  is  that  the  situa- 
tion, the  national  exigency,  the  crisis,  call  for  the  right  man.  Therefore 
it  is  that  a  silent  and  resistless  revolution  demands  our  patriotic  and 
best  judgment.  Individuals  are  as  nothing  and  personal  ambitions  are 
worse  than  nothing.  Impersonality  should  be  the  majesty  of  this  con- 
vention. If  the  chosen  candidate  fails  in  any  sense  or  in  any  degree 


DK.MOCKATir     \\T1OVAL    CONVENTION  159 

fully  si nd  completely  to  meet  tlio  call  of  the  nation,  he  is  doomed  to 
defeat.  [Applause.] 

Men  are  known  by  what  they  say  and  do.  Men  are  known  by  those 
who  hate  them  and  those  who  oppose  them.  [Applause.]  Many  years 
ago  the  great  executive  of  New  Jersey  said,  ' '  No  man  is  great  who 
thinks  himself  so,  and  no  man  is  good  who  does  not  strive  to  secure  the 
happiness  and  comfort  of  others."  [Applause.]  This  is  the  secret  of 
his  life.  This  is,  in  the  last  analysis,  the  explanation  of  his  power. 
Later,  in  his  memorable  effort  to  retain  high  scholarship  and  simple 
democracy  in  Princeton  University,  he  declared,  ' '  The  great  voice  of 
America  does  not  come  from  seats  of  learning.  It  comes  in  a  murmur 
from  the  hills  and  woods,  and  the  farms  and  factories  and  the  mills, 
rolling  on  and  gaining  volume  until  it  comes  to  us  from  the  homes  of 
common  men.  Do  these  murmurs  echo  in  the  corridors  of  our  universi- 
ties? I  have  not  heard  them."  A  clarion  call  to  the  spirit  that  now 
moves  America.  Still  later  he  shouted,  "I  will  not  cry  peacfe  so  long  as 
social  injustice  and  political  wrong  exist  in  the  state  of  New  Jersey." 
[Applause.]  Here  is  the  very  soul  of  the  silent  revolution  now  solidify- 
ing sentiment  and  purpose  in  our  common  country. 

The  deeds  of  this  moral  and  intellectual  giant  are  known  to  all  men. 
They  accord,  not  with  the  shams  and  pretenses  of  diseased  and  dis- 
organized politics,  but  make  national  harmony  with  the  millions  of 
^patriots  determined  to  correct  the  wrongs  of  plutocracy  and  re-establish 
the  maxims  of  American  liberty  in  all  their  regnant  beauty  and  practical 
effectiveness.  [Applause.)  New  Jersey  loves  her  governor,  not  for  the 
enemies  he  has  made,  but  for  what  he  is.  All  evil  is  his  enemy.  He  is 
the  enemy  of  all  evil.  The  influences  opposing  him  have  demonstrated 
his  availability  and  fitness  on  the  one  hand,  and  exposed  the  unavaila- 
bility and  unfitness  of  certain  others  on  the  other  hand.  The  influence 
that  has  opposed  him  blights  and  blasts  any  cause  and  any  person  it 
espouses.  That  influence  has  appealed  to  the  sordid,  the  low  and  the 
criminal.  That  influence  fattens  and  gorges  itself  on  ignorance  and 
avarice.  Any  man  that  accepts  the  aid  of  that  influence  would  be  more 
fortunate  had  a  mill  stone  been  tied  about  his  neck  and  he  had  been 
rast  into  the  depths  of  the  sea.  [Applause.]  New  Jersey  believes  that 
the  opposition  to  her  Governor,  such  as  it  has  been  and  such  as  it  is, 
necessitates  and  secures  his  triumph. 

Similar  necessities,  causes  and  motives  impel  all  men  similarly  the 
world  over.  The  same  necessities,  causes  and  motives  which  draw,  as  by 
omnipotence,  all  New  Jersey  about  this  great  and  good  man,  are 
identically  the  same  necessities,  causes  and  motives  that  are  in  resistless 
motion  in  every  state  in  the  Union.  [Applause.]  Its  solidarity  cannot 
be  disintegrated.  Fsilse  argument  falls  broken  against  it.  A  revolu- 
tion of  intelligent  and  patriotic  millions  is  the  expression  of  these  same 
necessities,  causes  and  motives.  Therefore,  New  Jersey  argues  that  her 
distinguished  Governor  is  the  only  candidate  who  can  not  only  make 


160  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Democratic  success  a  certainty,  but  secure  the  electoral  vote  of  almost 
every  state  in  the  Union.  [Applause.]  New  Jersey  herself  will  endorse 
his  nomination  by  a  majority  of  one  hundred  thousand  of  her  liberated 
citizens.  What  New  Jersey  will  do,  every  debatable  state  in  the  Union 
will  do.  [Applause.]  We  are  building,  not  for  a  day,  or  even  a  gen- 
eration, but  for  all  time.  Let  not  the  belief  that  any  candidate  may 
succeed  rob  us  of  sound  judgment.  What  would  it  profit  the  Democratic 
party  to  win  now,  only  to  be  cast  out  four  years  hence?  The  Democratic 
party  is  commissioned  to  carry  on  a  great  constructive  program,  having 
for  its  end  a  complete  restoration  of  the  doctrine  of  equal  rights  and 
equal  opportunity — without  injury  or  wrong  to  anyone.  Providence  has 
given  us,  in  the  exalted  character  of  New  Jersey's  Executive,  the  mental 
and  moral  equipment  to  accomplish  this  reincarnation  of  Democracy. 

New  Jersey  believes  that  there  is  an  omniscience  in  national  instinct. 
That  instinct  centers  in  her  Governor.  He  is  that  instinct.  [Applause.] 
How  can  his  power  in  every  state  be  explained?  He  has  been  in  political 
life  less  than  two  years.  He  has  had  no  organization  of  the  usual  sort; 
only  a  practical  ideal,  the  re-establishment  of  equal  opportunity.  [Ap- 
plause.] The  logic  of  events  points  to  him.  The  imperial  voice  of 
patriotism  calls  to  him.  Not  his  deeds  alone,  not  his  immortal  words 
alone,  not  his  simple  personality  alone,  not  his  incomparable  powers 
alone,  not  his  devotion  to  truth  and  principles  alone,  but  all  combined, 
compel  national  faith  and  confidence  in  him.  [Applause.]  Every  crisis 
evolves  its  master.  Time  and  circumstance  have  evolved  the  immortal 
Governor  of  New  Jersey.  The  North,  the  South,  the  East  and  the  West 
unite  in  him.  Deep  calls  to  deep.  Height  calls  to  height. 

"From  peak  to  peak,  the  rattling  clouds  among, 
Leaps  the  live  thunder.    Not  from  one  lone  cloud, 
But  every  mountain  now  hath  found  a  tongue 
And  Jura  answers  through  her  misty  shrouds 
Back  to  the  joyous  Alps,  who  call  to  her  aloud." 

The  lightning  flash  of  his  genius  has  cleared  the  atmosphere.  We 
low  know  where  we  are.  The  thunder  of  his  sincerity  is  shaking  the 
fvery  foundations  of  wrong  and  corruption.  [Applause.] 

This  convention  stands  between  ninety  millions  of  people  and  a 
thousand  monopolies.  .It  stands  between  ninety  millions  of  people  who 
need  a  free  and  fair  opportunity  and  a  thousand  trusts  that  have  spe- 
cial privileges.  The  great  issue  is  to  restore  to  the  people  equal  oppor- 
tunity, and,  at  the  same  time,  to  compel  monopolies  and  trusts  to  pro- 
ceed upon  the  same  principle.  This  issue  cannot  be  solved  by  a  plat- 
form. Thousands  of  platforms  will  not  solve  it.  The  man  on  the  plat- 
form alone  can  solve  it.  If  he  has  the  moral  force  and  personal  courage 
and  mental  ability,  he  will  solve  it  because  ninety  millions  of  confiding 
men,  women  and  children  stand  behind  him.  [Applause.]  Such  is  the 


l)K.Hoc'i!ATU'  NATIONAL  CONVENTION'  161 

moaning  of  the  appearance  of  the  Governor  of  New  Jersey  at  this  time 
in  the  history  of  the  nation.  [Applause.]  From  the  roar  and  struggle 
and  strife  preceding  this  convention  and  now  involving  it,  there  arises 
in  majesty  one  character,  unsullied  and  unsoiled.  He  has  made  but  one 
compact.  That  compact  was  with  his  conscience.  He  has  made  but  one 
agreement.  That  agreement  was  with  his  country  and  his  God.  [Ap- 
plause.] He  is  under  but  one  obligation.  That  obligation  is  to  the 
eternal  principle  of  truth  and  right.  It  requires  no  sophistry  to  explain 
either  his  position  or  his  character.  He  stands  in  the  eternal  light  of 
truth,  a  brave,  fearless  and  patriotic  soul.  [Applause.]  If  Providence 
could  spare  us  a  Washington  to  lay  deep  in  the  granite  of  human  need 
the  foundations  of  the  United  States;  if  Providence  could  spare  us  a 
Jefferson  to  give  form  and  vitality  to  the  most  splendid  democracy 
The  sun  ever  shone  upon;  if  Providence  could  spare  us  a  Lincoln  to  unite 
these  states  in  impregnable  unity  and  brotherhood,  New  Jersey  appeals 
to  the  patriotism  and  good  sense  of  this  convention  to  give  to  the  country 
the  services  of  the  distinguished  governor  of  New  Jersey,  that  the  doors 
of  opportunity  may  again  be  opened  wide  to  every  man,  woman  and 
child  under  the  Stars  and  Stripes,  so  that,  to  use  his  own  matchless 
phrase,  ' '  their  energies  may  be  released  intelligently,  that  peace,  jus- 
tice and  prosperity  may  reign."  [Applause.] 

Now  Jersey  appreciates  her  deliverance.  New  Jersey  appreciates  the 
great  constructive  results  of  her  Governor's  efforts  during  the  past  two 
years,  hut  New  Jersey  appreciates  more  than  that  the  honor  which  she 
nn\\  lias,  through  her  freely  chosen  representatives  sitting  before  me,  of 
placing  before  this  convention  as  a  candidate  for  the  presidency  of  the 
United  States  the  seer  and  philosopher  of  Princeton,  the  Princeton 
schoolmaster,  Woodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  C.  R.  PENDLETON,  of  Georgia  (when  the  State  of  Georgia  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Jefferson  Randolph  Anderson  will  speak 
for  Georgia. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  now 
present  Hon.  Jefferson  Randolph  Anderson,  of  the  State  of  Georgia. 

SPEECH  OF  JEFFERSON  RANDOLPH  ANDERSON. 

Mi:.  ANDERSON,  of  Georgia:  Mr.  Chairman  and  fellow  Democrats, 
this  day  is  one  which  gives  just  cause  for  congratulation  to  every  loyal 
Democrat,  and  should  bring  joy  and  gratification  'to  the  heart  of  every 
truly  patriotic  citizen  of  our  great  Republic,  for  this  day  will  be  entered 
upon  its  annals  among  those  which  mark  the  most  memorable  events  of 
its  history. 

For  causes  which  are  being  rapidly  obscured  in  the  mists  of  the  past, 
and  with  which  the  generation  of  the  present  day  has  no  longer  any  per- 


162  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

sonal  concern,  it  is  historically  true  that  for  more  than  fifty  years 
our  national  life  has  been  one-sided,  in  that  its  highest  offices  have  been 
restricted  by  certain  geographical  limitations.  Today  we  awake  to  the 
full  realization  of  the  fact  that  if  any  rift  ever  existed  in  our  national 
lute,  it  has  been  completely  repaired  by  the  healing  hand  of  time,  and 
that  today  the  grand  chorus  of  our  national  anthem  swells  out  strong  and 
true  from  every  cot  and  hamlet  of  the  land,  without  a  single  discordant 
note  to  mar  its  patriotic  harmony.  [Applause.] 

When  we  witness,  as  we  do  today,  the  fact  that  at  least  three  of  the 
several  distinguished  men  placed  in  nomination  before  this  great  national 
convention  for  the  highest  office  in  the  land,  were  born  outside  the 
geographic  confines  of  what  for  half  a  century  has  been  considered  the 
exclusive  territory  in  which  to  search  for  presidential  timber,  we  know 
that  the  recording  pencil  of  history  will  mark  this  day  as  the  dawn  of 
a  new  epoch  for  this  nation.  It  is  the  beginning  of  a  new  era  in 
which  the  door  of  hope  and  ambition  is  at  last  thrown  open  wide  to 
every  American  citizen  wherever  he  may  live  in  our  common  country,  and 
means  that  the  great  heart  of  the  Union  is  big  enough  and  strong 
enough  to  take  into  itself  every  citizen  and  every  foot  of  land  within 
Jts  borders,  that  it  recognizes  no  limitations  of  time  or  space,  but  pulsates 
with  the  life  blood  from  every  quarter  of  the  entire  nation,  and  that  at 
last  our  government  has  become  in  spirit  as  well  as  in  form  in  indis- 
soluble Union  of  indissoluble  States.  [Applause.] 

We  are  assembled  here  today  as  representatives  of  the  historic  party 
founded  by  the  author  of  that  great  charter  of  American  liberties,  the 
Declaration  of  Independence,  to  select  our  standard  bearer  in  what 
may  well  prove  to  be  the  most  memorable  Presidential  campaign  in  our 
country 's  history.  To  me  the  Democratic  party  means  more  than  a 
name,  more  than  a  symbol.  It  means  and  represents  a  code  of  political 
principles  as  eternal  and  as  immutable  as  the  stars  themselves,  and 
upon  the  conservation  and  perpetuation  of  which  depends  the  preserva- 
tion of  our  Eepublic,  and  the  consequent  future  happiness,  as  freeman, 
of  ourselves  and  of  our  posterity. 

From  my  earliest  infancy  until  past  my  majority  a  great  portion  of 
nearly  each  year  of  my  life  was  spent  in  sight  of,  and  under  the  shadow 
of,  the  home  and  tomb  of  the  illustrious  founder  of  our  party,  Thomas 
Jefferson.  His  beliefs,  principles  and  ideals  for  the  party  were  instilled 
into  my  mind,  as  boy  and  youth,  by  a  man  whom  he  himself  had  prac- 
tically reared,  who  stood  to  him  as  a  son,  and  who  in  turn,  as  the  cares 
of  age  pressed  heavily  upon  the  great  Sage  of  Monticello,  became  his 
representative  and  took  charge  of  his  affairs.  That  man  was  Jeffer- 
son's grandson  and  my  grandfather.  To  me,  therefore,  the  principles 
of  our  party  are  in  a  way  a  matter  of  inheritance,  and  I  rejoice  at  the 
opportunity  and  privilege  that  has  been  accorded  me  of  taking -part 
in  these  councils  of  the  party,  and  of  seconding  the  nomination  of  a 
man,  who,  after  thirty  years  of  close  personal  friendship,  I  know  to  be  a 


DEMOCRATIC  XATIOXAL  COXVEXTIOX  163 

sincere  and  loyal  believer  in,  as  well  as  a  most  worthy  and  able  exponent 
of,  our  party 's  principles. 

The  Republican  party,  after  years  of  uninterrupted  power,  is  top- 
pling into  ruin  because  of  its  lack  of  fundamental  principles,  and  its 
betrayal  of  its  pledges  to  the  people.  Its  recent  party  convention  in 
Chicago  has  presented  the  disgusting  spectacle  of  a  life  and  death 
struggle  between  an  Ex-President  of  the  nation  and  the  present  tem- 
porary incumbent  of  that  office,  a  struggle  which  has  rent  the  party 
asunder  and  has  destroyed  its  vitality  and  its  prospects. 

Unlike  them  we  are  assembled  here  for  brotherly  discussion  and 
consultation.  No  fearsome  spectre  of  a  divided  party  threatens  us. 
We  are  here,  to  loyally  and  earnestly  urge  our  respective  views  and 
preferences,  but  we  are  also  here,  as  good  Democrats,  to  loyally  and 
unitedly  rally  to  and  support,  at  the  polls,  the  man  whom  this  conven- 
tion, in  its  wisdom,  shall  finally  select  to  bear  our  plume  upon  his 
helmet  in  the  coming  campaign.  Such  I  know  to  be  the  sentiments  and 
wish  of  him  whose  nomination  I  have  the  honor  to  second. 

Sir,  the  great  State  of  Georgia,  from  which  I  come  and  which  we,  her 
sons,  fondly  call  the  Empire  State  of  the  South,  in  whose  behalf  I  speak 
here  today,  is,  as  you  well  know,  a  strength  and  bulwark  to  our  party, 
and  her  solid  electoral  vote  can  always  reasonably, be  counted  on  for  the 
party's  nominee.  We  are  fundamentally  a  Democratic  State  and  we 
glory  in  the  fact.  As  regards  national  affairs,  we  still  believe  that  the 
American  Constitution,  as  framed  by  our  forefathers,  is  what  Jefferson 
described  it  to  be — ' '  The  ark  of  our  safety  and  the  grand  palladium  of 
our  peace  and  happiness."  We  still  believe  with  Madison,  the  father 
of  the  Constitution,  that  the  greatest  danger  to  which  popular  forms  of 
government  is  exposed  is  the  violence  of  faction  or  mob  spirit,  and  that 
in  a  government  regulated  only  by  majorities,  if  the  impulse  and  the 
opportunity  should  both  happen  to  coincide,  neither  moral  nor  religious 
motives  could  be  relied  on  to  keep  a  triumphant  or  frenzied  majority 
from  riding  rough-shod  over  all  rights  of  the  minority  or  of  the 
individual.  "[Applause.] 

We  love  liberty,  as  our  forefathers  did,  but  we  believe,  as  they  be- 
lieved, that  true  liberty  cannot  be  long  preserved  under  the  form  of  a 
pure  Democracy ;  that  the  history  of  practically  all  pure  democracies, 
where  the  people  assemble  or  in  any  form  attempt  themselves  to  ad- 
minister the  government  by  making  the  laws  in  person,  demonstrates 
that  that  form  of  government  offers  no  cure  for  the  evils  of  factional 
spirit,  and  provides  no  guarantees  for  the  liberty,  peace  and  happiness 
of  the  minority,  much  less  of  the  individual,  from  oppression  by  the 
majority ;  and  that  such  democracies  have  usually  been  spectacles  of 
turbulence  and  contention,  and  have  in  general  been  as  short  in  their 
lives  as  they  have  been  violent  in  their  deaths. 

Therefore  we  would  have  nothing  of  that  kind  attempted  for  this 
nation.  We  still  agree  with  the  opinion  of  Jefferson  that  the  only 


164  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  TIIF. 

device  by  which  the  rights  of  man  can  be  secure*!,  in  a  country  such  as 
ours,  is  by  a  government  by  the  people,  acting  not  in  person  but  by 
representatives  chosen  by  themselves.  [Applause.]  We  believe  that 
the  two  corner  stones  of  our  government,  which  the  world  has  justly 
regarded  as  the  crowning  glory  of  American  achievement,  and  under 
which  our  country,  after  a  career  of  the  greatest  prosperity,  has  risen 
to  the  highest  pinnacle  among  the  nations  of  the  earth,  are  (1st)  a 
written  Constitution,  subject  to  change  only  by  prescribed  methods, 
thus  giving  its  protection  to  the  individual  citizen;  and  (2nd)  a  repub- 
lican form  of  government  based  on  the  principle  of  representation. 
These  are  the  two  essentials  of  our  government  which  Jefferson  pro- 
nounced to  be  "the  two  sheet  anchors  of  our  Union,  and  that  if  driven 
from  either  we  would  be  in  danger  of  foundering. ' '  We  still  believe 
in  the  basic  truths  of  our  Democratic  faith  as  contained  in  Jefferson's 
first  inaugural  address,  and  particularly  in  that  cardinal  doctrine  of  our 
party,  equal  rights  to  all,  special  privileges  for  none.  We  hope  to  see 
all  these  fundamental  principles  of  the  party  revived  and  reaffirmed  by 
this  Convention. 

The  State  of  Georgia  has  given  a  large  amount  of  territory  to  this 
Union  out  of  which  other  States  have  subsequently  been  erected.  Of  this 
one  of  the  fairest  portions,  lying  nearest  to  her  heart,  was  that  compris- 
ing the  greater  part  of  what  is  now  the  State  of  Alabama.  It  is  with 
peculiar  pride  and  pleasure,  therefore,  that  Georgia  sees  her  daughter 
State,  now  in  the  full  bloom  of  her  magnificent  maturity,  bring  forward 
for  the  Presidential  nomination  a  man  whom  every  Democrat  can 
delight  to  honor,  and  in  whose  integrity,  wisdom,  ability  and  courage 
every  American  can  place  the  most  implicit  trust  and  confidence.  Georgia 
has  gladly  given  him  her  endorsement,  and  has  instructed  us,  her  dele- 
gates in  this  Convention,  to  give  him  our  united  support  until  his  nom- 
ination is  secured. 

We  confidently  look  forward  to  the  certainty  of  his  nomination,  and 
ask  you  to  examine,  as  we  have  done,  into  his  pre-eminent  qualifications 
for  this  high  office,  in  the  serene  conviction  that  when  you  have  done  so 
you  will  agree  with  us  that  there  is  no  other  man  today  to  whom  our 
party  owes  more  than  it  does  to  him,  and  that  there  is  no  other  whose 
nomination  holds  out  greater  promise  for  the  common  people  of  our 
country,  or  whom  they  will  more  readily  support. 

Both  Alabama  and  Georgia  are  among  the  most  progressive  States 
of  the  Union  in  all  that  pertains  to  the  material  welfare  of  their  people 
or  to  their  moral  and  sociological  uplift.  There  are  two  sorts  of 
progressives,  the  true  and  the  political.  We  have  with  us,  as  there  are 
elsewhere,  a  class  of  politicians  who  style  themselves  "progressives" 
and  freely  apply  the  term  "reactionaries"  to  all  who  do  not  vote  with 
them;  men  who  would  take  us  up  upon  a  mountain  and  mislead  us  by 
displaying  a  glittering  mirage  that  conceals  the  real  desert  of  their 
promises;  but  we  have  learned  to  know  that  they  themselves  are  for  the 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  165 

most  part  drones,  not  workers  in  the  hive,  and  contribute  no  jot  or  tittle 
to  the  real  progress  of  our  country.  We  have  learned  by  experience  to 
know  that,  when  put  to  the  test,  these  men  too  often  show  that  they 
have  no  real  knowledge  of  the  country's  needs,  and  that  their  actual 
ideas  of  progress  are  the  exploitation  of  chimerical  and  impracticable 
ideas  or  else  resemble  the  movements  of  a  certain  crustacean,  well 
known  along  our  coasts,  whose  only  mode  of  progression  is  by  moving 
backward  or  sideways  from  every  obstacle  it  encounters.  Fools  rush  in 
where  angels  fear  to  tread,  and  the  truly  progressive  statesman  must 
proceed  with  caution. 

Do  you  desire  progress?  Our  candidate  is  progressive  in  the  only 
true  sense  of  the  word,  in  going  steadily  forward  and  upward,  without 
letting  go  of  the  well  tried  ancient  faiths  and  without  ignoring  or  con- 
temning the  lessons  and  experience  of  the  past. 

Do  you  wish  a  man  of  experience,  well  versed  in  the  legislative  and 
governmental  affairs  and  machinery  of  our  country?  The  record  and 
career  of  our  candidate  for  sixteen  years  in  Congress  gives  you  all  the 
assurances  you  could  possibly  desire.  In  that  period  of  long,  splendid 
and  faithful  service  he  has  served  loyally  and  well  through  all  gradua- 
tions in  the  party  ranks  until  he  has  reached  the  proud  position  he  holds 
today,  that  of  being  the  recognized  leader  and  acclaimed  head  of  our 
party  in  the  councils  of  the  nation,  and  has  become  the  most  com- 
manding figure  in  Congress  today.  Who  better  than  he,  if  elected 
President,  could  hope  to  obtain  the  enthusiastic  support  of  the  Congress 
of  the  United  States  for  his  administration,  or  could  more  confidently 
rely  upon  the  loyal,  whole  hearted  support  of  our  party?  [Applause.] 

Look  at  his  record  for  achievements  and  for  leadership.  It  deserves 
and  it  receives  the  admiration  of  the  entire  country  for  its  constructive, 
progressive  statesmanship,  and  for  the  truly  marvelous  qualities  and 
abilities  he  has  exhibited  as  a  leader  of  men."  It  is  lamentably  true  that 
prior  to  his  time  our  party  had  for  many  years  been  wandering  in  the 
wilderness,  running  after  strange  lights,  and  following  after  vain 
illusions.  In  Congress  its  course  was  too  often  marked  by  petty  bicker- 
ings, dissension  and  lack  of  unity  of  purpose,  so  much  so  that  it  became 
common  report  that  its  opponents  could  always  rely  upon  it  to  do  the 
wrong  thing  at  the  crucial  moment. 

Who  was  it,  when  made  leader  of  the  party,  that  lifted  it  out  of  the 
quagmire  in  which  it  had  been  floundering,  and  set  it  upon  its  feet?  It 
was  Underwood  of  Alabama.  Who  was  it  that  wrought  harmony  out  of 
disorder,  and  brought  it  forward  to  the  line  of  battle,  on  the  opening 
of  the  Sixty-second  Congress,  an  aggressive,  cohesive,  united,  disciplined 
rarty  which  threw  confusion  into  the  ranks  of  its  opponents,  and  enabled 
it  to  carry  out  its  party  pledges?  It  was  Underwood  of  Alabama. 
[Applause.] 

Who  was  it,  that  by  his  expert  knowledge  of  the  tariff  and  his  skillful 
leadership,  was  able  to  frame  and  to  enable  the  party  to  carry  through 


166  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

the  House  the  several  bills  reducing  the  tariff  schedules  by  majorities, 
in  every  case  but  one,  greater  than  the  normal  party  majority  in  the 
House?  Again  the  answer  is  Underwood  of  Alabama.  [Applause.] 

To  the  great  class  of  consumers,  which  constitutes  the  mass  of  our 
people,  the  great  benefit  of  these  laws,  had  they  not  been  vetoed,  is  stag- 
gering in  its  magnitude,  yet  the  marvelous  skill  with  which  the  bills 
were  drawn  is  shown  by  the  fact  that  taking  them  as  a  whole  the  result- 
ing net  loss  in  revenue  to  the  national  treasury  was  comparatively  small. 
The  Farmers'  Free  List  Bill,  the  Wool,  Cotton,  Metal,  Chemicals  and 
Sugar  Bills  would  have  resulted  in  an  annual  saving  to  the  consumers  of 
this  country  of  743  millions  of  dollars,  yet  the  net  loss  in  revenue  to 
the  national  treasury  would  have  been  only  some  66  millions,  of  which 
60  millions  would  have  been  made  up  by  the  Underwood  Excise  Bill, 
taxing  business  incomes,  thus  leaving  an  actual  falling  off  of  only  some 
six  million  dollars  in  the  revenues.  [Applause.] 

Truly  this  is  a  record  to  which  any  man  and  any  party  can  point  with 
pride.  It  is  the  framing  and  passing  of  these  measures,  together  with 
his  well  known  views  in  favor  of  a  rational  revision  of  our  banking 
system,  (that  would  also  preserve  our  local  banks  from  dominant  financial 
or  political  control,)  and  his  views  in  favor  of  national  aid  to  highways, 
and  other  popular  measures  that  have  given  Underwood  the  confidence  of 
the  people.  They  know  him  to  be  safe  and  sane,  and  they  know  him  to 
be  consistent  and  courageous;  a  man  who  is  not  to  be  swerved  from  his 
course  by  the  threats  of  any  clique  or  corporation,  however  powerful,  of 
abandoning  large  projected  improvements  in  his  home  district  or  of 
raising  up  possible  opposition  to  himself.  If  you  give  them  the  chance 
the  people  will  sweep  him  into  office  by  a  tremendous  majority.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

Do  you  believe  as  we  do  that  the  tariff  is  bound  to  be  the  chief  con- 
trolling issue  of  this  campaign.  Then  our  candidate  is  the  only  logical 
leader  for  us  to  select.  He  is  beyond  all  question  the  greatest  tariff 
expert  in  public  life  today.  (The  ^Republicans  have  re-nominated  Mr. 
Taft.  The  wave  of  popular  disapproval  which  followed  his  failure  to 
reduce  the  tariff,  gave  to  our  party  the  control  of  the  present  House  in 
Congress.)  For  the  past  two  years  the  great  fight  that  has  been  waged 
in  Congress  between  the  two  parties  has  been  over  the  question  of  tariff 
reduction. 

Underwood  as  leader  of  the  one  side  has  been  framing  and  passing 
the  reductions  the  people  want,  while  Taft  as  the  leader  of  the  other 
side  has  been  vetoing  them  as  they  reached  him.  The  time  is  here  for 
the  transfer  of  this  fight  from  the  Halls  of  Congress  to  the  hustings  of 
the  people  and  common  sense  as  well  as  political  expediency  demand 
that  the  battle  should  be  carried  on  under  the  same  two  leaders.  As  the 
^Republicans  have  retained  their  same  leader  in  Mr.  Taft,  it  would  be 
the  height  of  political  folly  for  us  not  to  retain  ours,  and  to  attempt  tc 
swap  horses  in  the  middle  of  the  stream.

DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  167 

Oh,  my  fellow  Democrats,  let  us  select  for  our  standard  bearer  the 
man  who  has  brought  party  harmony  out  of  disorder,  who  has  done  more 
than  any  other  to  make  Democratic  success  this  year  a  possibility,  who 
has  formulated  and  shaped  up  the  controlling  issue  on  which  this  cam- 
paign must  be  fought  and  won,  that  of  tariff  for  revenue  only,  who-4s 
our  only  logical  leader  on  that  issue,  and  is  our  chosen  leader  in  Congress 
at  this  time.  It  gives  me,  Sir,  the  most  heartfelt  pleasure  on  my  own 
behalf  and  on  behalf  of  the  State  of  Georgia,  and  I  trust  also  on  behalf 
of  our  entire  party,  to  second  the  nomination  of  the  Hon.  Osear  W. 
Underwood,  of  Alabama,  for  President  of  these  United  States  of  Amer- 
ica. [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  the  State  of  Illinois 
was  called. 

Mr.  Douglas  Pattison,  of  Illinois,  rose. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  presents  to  the  Convention 
Hon.  Douglas  Pattison,  of  Illinois. 

SPEECH  OF  DOUGLAS  PATTISON. 

MR.  DOUGLAS  PATTISON,  of  Illinois:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
of  this  Convention,  on  behalf  of  the  Democracy  of  the  State  of  Illinois, 
and  on  behalf  of  600,000  loyal,  militant,  progressive  Democrats,  I  desire 
to  second  the  nomination  of  the  distinguished  son  of  a  sister  State,  Hon. 
Champ  Clark,  of  Missouri.  [Applause.]  In  the  primary  which  we  had 
he  carried  our  State  by  a  vote  of  three  to  one,  and  we  are  pledged  to 
him  and  instructed  for  him  under  the  most  solemn  obligation  and  duty 
both  to  him  and  to  our  constituents. 

But  more  than  that,  I  want  to  tell  you  that  our  hearts  are  with  him 
in  this  fight  that  he  is  making.  [Applause.]  Since  we  have  come  here 
I  have  heard  some  talk,  and  hjive  seen  statements  in  the  newspapers,  that 
Illinois  was  going  to  cast  only  two  or  three  perfunctory  ballots  for  Mr. 
Clark  and  then  abandon  him  for  someone  else.  That  is  not  true.  We 
have  nailed  his  banner  to  our  mast,  and  we  are  going  through  with  him ; 
and  even  if  we  go  down,  we  will  do  it  with  lights  shining  brightly  and 
banners  waving  and  the  band  playing.  [Applause.] 

The  great  handicap  under  which  we  have  been  laboring  in  campaigns 
r  for  the  last  few  years  has  been  that  our  appeal  to  the  people  has  been 
based  upon  what  we  said  we  would  do  if  we  were  elected  and  not  what 
we  had  done  in  the  past.  With  parties  as  with  people  promises  are  cheap 
but  deeds  are  golden.  But  this  year  things  are  different.  We  have  a 
record  of  accomplishment  upon  which  to  go  before  the  country  in  this 
campaign.  Under  the  leadership  of  Champ  Clark  the  Democracy  in  the 
national  House  of  Eepresentatives,  as  our  eloquent  Chairman  told  you 
yesterday,  has  delivered  the  goods.  The  leadership  of  Champ  Clark  has 
made  it  possible  for  us  to  become  a  party  of  constructive,  progressive 
achievement,  instead  of  merely  a  party  of  negation  and  of  criticism,  and 


168  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

I  think  the  man  who  has  furnished  us  the  ammunition  in  this  campaign 
is  entitled  to  lead  the  fight. 

In  the  last  three  or  four  weeks  I  believe  all  of  us  have  received  a 
certain  amount  of  villification  of  Champ  Clark,  issued  from  some  anony- 
mous source,  and  coming  to  us  through  the  mails.  They  have  said  every- 
thing about  him  with  the  idea  of  discrediting  him.  One  thing  they  say 
is  that  he  is  a  politician  or  statesman  of  the  old  style.  In  answer  to 
that  I  want  to  call  your  attention  to  the  pre-convention  campaign  which 
has  just  closed.  During  all  the  heat  of  that  struggle,  while  primaries 
were  being  held  and  delegations  were  being  elected  in  the  different 
States,  he  was  at  his  post  of  duty  in  Washington,  doing  the  work  that 
he  was  elected  and  paid  to  perform,  while  others  were  engaged  in  a  mad 
scramble  for  votes.  His  conduct  showed  that  he  is  a  man  of  high  char- 
acter and  with  a  fine  sense  of  honor  which  is  too  seldom  met  with  nowa- 
days. [Applause.] 

I  want  to  say  only  one  word  more,  and  that  is  this:  We  do  not  claim 
for  him  that  he  is  omnipotent.  We  do  not  claim  that  he  is  a  god  or  a 
demigod.  We  do  not  claim  that  he  is  an  angel  or  an  archangel.  We 
do  not  claim  that  he  has  any  of  the  attributes  of  anything  except  a 
human  being.  We  do  claim  that  he  is  a  very  honest,  very  able,  very 
eloquent,  very  forceful,  very  true  and  very  lovable  human  being,  and  he 
is  beloved  by  millions  of  people  all  over  these  United  States,  who  ex- 
pressed their  love  for  him  in  the  primaries,  and  who  are  awaiting  your 
action  here  in  order  to  know  whether  they  may  vote  for  him.  [Applause.] 

In  conclusion  I  want  to  say  he  is  a  Democrat,  and  this  year  we  are 
going  to  win.  [Applause.]  It  is  in  the  air  and  we  are  going  to  win 
the  campaign  this  year.  Let  us  win  with  a  Democrat  like  Champ  Clark. 
[Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  the  State  of 
Indiana  was  called. 

Mr.  Benjamin  F.  Shively,  of  Indiana,  rose. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  takes  pleasure  in  presenting 
to  the  Convention  Senator  Shively,  of  Indiana. 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  BENJAMIN  F.  SHIVELY. 

MR.  BENJAMIN  F.  SHIVELY,  of  Indiana:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentle- 
men of  the  Convention:  Within  a  few  hours  this  Convention  will  have 
executed  the  high  commission  with  which  it  is  charged  and  will  have 
been  dissolved  by  final  adjournment.  But  with  the  fall  of  the  gavel  and 
even  before  silence  and  solitude  shall  succeed  the  storms  of  applause  in 
this  hall,  the  work  of  this  Convention  will  have  gone  before  a  less  partial 
assize,  and  one  that  knows  no  adjournment  until  the  last  vote  is  cast  on 
the  fifth  day  of  November.  To  equip  the  cause  which  is  fraught  with 
such  high  and  solemn  import  at  this  crisis  of  our  country's  history  with 
all  the  strength  that  patriotic  foresight  can  bestow  to  pass  triumphantly 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  1G9 

the  ordeal  of  that  long  and  searching  inquisition,  is  the  supreme  duty  of 
this  convention.  With  such  a  cause  and  at  such  an  hour,  we  shall  not 
be  easily  forgiven  if  we  overlook  any  lesson  of  history  or  instruction  of 
experience  or  suggestion  from  the  present  situation  that  may  point  the 
course  and  illumine  the  pathway  to  success. 

I  speak  for  the  Democracy  of-  a  State  that  has  within  the  memory  of 
men  in  this  hall  given  to  the  public  life  of  the  country  the  shining  talent 
and  patriotic  services  of  a  Thomas  A.  Hendricks,  a  Joseph  E.  McDonald, 
a  Daniel  W.  Voorhees,  and  a  David  Turpie.  [Applause.]  Further,  I 
speak  for  the  Democracy  of  a  State  whose  vote  has  carried  the  State  for 
every  Democratic  President  inaugurated,  from  James  Monroe  to  Grover 
Cleveland.  Through  all  the  ninety-six  years  of  its  statehood,  as  Indiana 
has  gone,  so  has  gone  the  Union.  [Applause.]  Whenever  in  all  these 
years  Indiana  has  been  won  for  the  national  ticket,  the  presidency  has 
been  won.  Whenever  Indiana  has  been  lost,  the  presidency  has  been 
lost.  This  result  was  not  mere  coincidence,  or  accident,  or  chance,  or 
freak,  or  caprice  of  politics.  In  the  wide  variety  of  nativity  among  her 
early  settlers,  in  the  development  of  her  civil  institutions,  in  the  variety 
of  her  industries,  Indiana  became  and  remained  typical  of  the  general 
spirit  and  impulse  of  the  whole  country.  Because  of  the  broad  sweep 
of  her  industrial  life  affected  by  the  vicissitudes  of  politics,  and  the 
composite  character  of  her  population,  Indiana  reflected  the  grand  aver- 
age of  that  national  feeling,  sentiment,  and  conviction  that  became  in- 
dexed in  the  election  returns  from  the  various  States,  and  decisive  in 
enough  States  to  control  the  presidency.  Nor  have  the  passing  years 
changed  this  situation,  save  to  confirm  it.  Indiana  is  found  by  the 
Bureau  of  the  Census  to  be  the  center  of  the  country's  population. 
Through  her  whole  history  Indiana  has  been  the  country's  center  of 
political  conflict,  struggle,  stress  and  storm,  and  is  today  the  unfailing 
barometer  of  national  political  temper,  political  purpose,  and  political 
fortune.  The  candidate  who  can  carry  Indiana  for  the  national  ticket 
can  carry  all  the  States  necessary  to  the  election  of  the  national  ticket. 
[Applause.] 

Four  years  ago  the  Democracy  of  Indiana  selected  a  candidate  for 
governor  from  a  field  of  unusual  talent.  From  the  first  note  of  his 
acceptance  before  the  convention  to  his  last  appeal  on  the  eve  of  election 
day,  his  campaign  was  a  constantly  rising  tide  of  enthusiasm.  By  his 
broad  grasp  and  clear  presentation  of  the  issues  he  everywhere  inspired 
hope,  courage,  zeal,  and  determination.  At  the  end  of  one  of  the  most 
skillfully  conducted  and  brilliantly  aggressive  campaigns  in  the  history 
of  the  State,  he  was  elected  governor  by  a  plurality  of  nearly  fourteen 
thousand.  Though  in  every  appeal  to  the  voters  of  the  State  he  had 
placed  the  cause  of  the  national  ticket  before  and  above  his  own,  he  led 
the  national  ticket  by  nearly  25,000  votes.  [Applause.]  These  votes 
were  not  confined  to  special  centers  of  population,  nor  due  to  special 
factional  influence.  They  were  distributed  through  nearly  all  the  over 


170  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

three  thousand  voting  precincts  of  the  State,  represented  men  of  thought 
and  conviction,  and  without  reference  to  occupation  or  walk  of  life.  In 
a  State  where  the  lines  of  battle  are  always  rigid,  this  wide  margin  of 
votes  attests  the  vivid  influence  and  compelling  force  of  the  candidate's 
advocacy  and  personality. 

In  the  same  campaign,  and  for  the  first  time  in  sixteen  years,  the 
Democracy  carried  the  legislature  on  joint  ballot,  secured  the  return  of 
a  United  States  Senator,  and  increased  the  Democratic  representation  in 
the  popular  branch  of  Congress  from  5  in  1906  to  11  in  1908  out  of  a 
total  membership  from  the  State  of  33.  Then,  with  such  fidelity,  prac- 
tical wisdom  and  general  credit  did  our  governor  execute  the  functions 
and  administer  the  affairs  of  his  high  office,  and  so  effective  was  be 
again  in  the  campaign  of  1910,  that  in  that  year  the  Democracy  elected 
the  entire  State  ticket,  carried  both  branches  of  the  legislature,  elected 
another  Democrat  to  the  United  States  Senate,  and  returned  12  of  the 
delegation  of  13  to  the  national  House  of  Eepresentatives.  [Applause. i 

As  Governor,  while  respecting  in  the  nicest  degree  the  limitations 
and  proprieties  of  his  office,  he  counseled  and  promoted  measures  to 
secure  increased  safeguards  to  the  life,  limb,  and  health  of  labor  engaged 
in  hazardous  employment;  to  curb  the  evils  of  child  labor  and  the 
cruelties  of  the  sweat  shop ;  to  enforce  the  weekly  payment  of  wages ;  to 
establish  public  employment  agencies  and  minimize  involuntary  idleness; 
to  prohibit  traffic  in  white  slaves;  to  establish  a  system  of  audit,  account 
and  inspection  to  insure  vigilance  and  fidelity  in  the  collection,  custody 
and  disbursement  of  public  funds;  to  recover  and  conserve  the  public 
lands  of  the  State;  to  require  registration  of  the  voters  and  safeguard 
elections  against  terrorism  by  the  boss  or  debauchment  by  the  boodler. 
and  other  measures,  all  promotive  of  stability  to  public  institutions  and 
security  to  private  rights.  [Applause.] 

,  It  has  been  under  such  auspices  that  the  State  of  Indiana  has  been 
redeemed.  Fidelity  to  public  trusts  marks  every  department  of  the 
State  government  and  is  reflected  in  a  quickened  sense  of  public  duty 
and  official  obligation  in  city,  county,  and  township  throughout  the  Stato. 
The  influence  of  wise  and  capable  leadership  is  everywhere  manifest.  It, 
was,  therefore,  altogether  natural,  logical,  and  fitting  that  the  Democracy 
of  Indiana  in  convention  assembled,  on  the  21st  day  of  March,  this  year, 
without  one  dissenting  voice,  adopted  the  following  resolution: 

"We  indorse  the  record  of  Governor  Thomas  R.  Marshall,  who  has 
given  the  State  the  best  administration  it  has  known  for  years.  Faithful 
to  his  oath  of  office,  he  has  fully  performed  his  duties  without  encroach- 
ing on  the  spheres  of  other  departments  or  betraying  the  interests  of 
the  people  for  political  purposes.  Without  attempting  to  dictate  to  the 
Legislature,  he  has  aided  it  in  every  beneficial  step  by  his  counsel  and 
influence.  Without  attempting  to  dictate  to  the  courts,  he  has  had 
brought  before  them  all  questions  for  which  attention  was  important  to 
the  public  welfare.  We  especially  commend  his  steps  inaugurating  judi- 


DEMOCRATIC   X ATJO.VAL  CONVENTION  171 

cial  action  for  the  conservation  of  the  public  lands,  and  for  reclaiming 
title  for  the  State  to  the  bods  of  streams  officially  declared  navigable, 
which  were  not  surveyed  or  sold  by  the  United  States,  as  a  movement 
which  makes  possible  the  saving  to  the  public  resources  of  enormous 
value.  In  all  his  official  life  he  has  proved  himself  a  man  of  the  highest 
integrity,  of  sound  judgment,  and  of  unfaltering  resolution  in  the  per- 
formance of  his  duty.  We  commend  him  to  the  people  of  the  United 
States  as  the  type  of  man  needed  for  the  presidency  and  instruct  our 
delegates  to  the  Democratic  National  Convention  to  present  his  name  to 
that  body  as  the  first  and  only  choice  of  the  Democracy  of  Indiana  for 
the  nomination  for  President."  [Applause.] 

That  convention  was  composed  of  1,747  delegates.  These  delegates 
represented  400,000  Democratic  voters.  In  the  action  taken  the  con- 
vention was  harmonious,  unanimous,  and  enthusiastic.  Never  was  a  more 
generous  and  ungrudged  tribute  of  confidence,  affection,  respect  and 
^ood-will  paid  to  a  public  man.  With  this  high  testimonial  to  his  worth 
from  those  who  know  him  best,  I  speak  the  voice  of  that  convention,  and 
in  behalf  of  the  united  Democracy  of  Indiana  present  the  name  and 
urge  the  nomination  of  Thomas  K.  Marshall.  [Applause.] 

Though  his  official  activities  and  experiences  have  been  within  the 
State,  Governor  Marshall  has  been,  since  his  early  youth,  a  student  of 
all  that  pertains  to  the  federal  government.  He  has  exceptional  capacity.*, 
for  discerning  the  vital  issues  in  our  national  life,  and  noting  the  points 
of  collision  between  economic  development  and  social  justice.  None 
knows  better  than  he  that  nothing  can  bind,  or  chain,  or  circumscribe,  or 
limit  power  but  power;  that  the  check  and  balance  of  power  against 
power  is  the  vital  principle  of  our  political  system;  that  the  twilight 
zone  is  only  that  shadowy  region  where  usurped  power  and  selfish  ambi- 
tion recklessly  sport  with  human  rights;  that  simplicity  and  economy  in 
government  f..re  the  comrades  of  efficiency  and  strength,  and  that  extrava- 
gance is  inseparable  from  sloth,  inefficiency  and  weakness.  None  is  bet- 
ter equipped  to  expose  and  dissolve  that  maze  of  sophisms  by  which 
interested  selfishness  makes  a  puzzle  of  political  power  only  to  reduce  it 
to  private  profit,  and  that  makes  mystery  of  government  only,  amid  the 
confusion,  to  convert  it  into  political  and  personal  merchandise.  Espe- 
cially is  he  thorough  on  the  question  of  that  perversion  of  the  principle 
of  custom-house  taxation  that  has  made  tariff  legislation  a  blanket  patent 
of  monopoly ;  that  has  quickened  into  life,  fostered  into  strength,  and 
fattened  into  wealth  and  power  an  irresponsible  confederacy  of  special 
privilege  within  the  body  of  the  Republic ;  that  creates  false  and  fraudu- 
lent relations  between  capital  and  labor ;  that  precipitates  the  class  spirit 
over  society ;  that  by  the  device  of  artificial  prices  carries  deprivation 
into  millions  of  homes,  and  that  makes  moral  shambles  of  elections  by 
debauching  the  citizen  whom  its  remorseless  exactions  have  first  impov- 
erished. [Applause.] 

If  you  ask  me  whether  he  is  constructive,  I  reply  that  he  constructs 


172  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

to  rights,  to  liberty,  to  justice,  to  security;  not  to  special  privilege  or 
selfish  power.  If  you  inquire  whether  he  is  progressive,  I  reply  that  his 
creed  is  that  of  Jefferson  applied  to  the  solution  of  the  vexed  problems  of 
this  hour.  This  to  the  end  that  the  tide  of  special  privilege  may  bv* 
turned  back,  equality  of  security  to  rights  before  the  law  made  a  fact; 
the  damp  of  the  class  spirit  lifted  from  society;  caste  dissolved  in  the 
sunshine  of  opportunity,  and  justice  restored  to  the  millions,  of  plain, 
industrious  citizens  who  pray  no  boon  from  government  save  recognition 
of  their  imprescriptible  right  to  enjoy  the  rewards  of  their  own  toil, 
undiminished  by  exactions  to  enrich  special  darlings  of  power.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

The  prestige  of  a  nomination  by  this  Convention  will  carry  power 
and  local  influence  to  the  State  favored  with  it.  This  will  constitute 
an  asset  the  value  of  which  should  not  be  overlooked.  It  should  be 
placed  where  it  will  contribute  most  decisively  to  national  victory.  It 
goes  without  saying  that  Indiana  will  not  be  a  laggard  in  the  oncoming 
contest,  whoever  may  be  chosen  to  captain  the  hosts.  But  in  the  early 
days  of  November,  when  the  clouds  hang  thick  and  low  over  the  battle- 
field, the  inquiry  will  not  be,  "How  goes  the  struggle  in  the  good  State 
of  Missouri?"  or  "Howr  goes  the  struggle  in  the  good  State  of  Ala- 
.  bama?"  Besides,  the  Democracy  needs  and  the  country  needs  the 
favorite  son  of  Missouri  in  the  most  important  post  in  the  parliamentary 
life  of  the  Republic — the  Speakership  of  the  House  of  Representatives, 
and  likewise  needs  the  gifted  son  of  Alabama  at  the  head  of  the  Com- 
mittee on  Ways  and  Means.  [Applause.]  Under  the  Constitution  of 
the  State  of  Indiana  the  Governor  is  ineligible  for  re-election.  Other 
States  in  which  Democratic  Governors  have  recently  been  elected  are  not 
so  situated.  These  Governors  should  be  spared  to  carry  forward  and 
complete  the  civic  regeneration  of  their  respective  States  which  they 
have  so  nobly  begun,  and  by  their  influence  within  the  States  bring  them 
into  the  National  Democratic  column.  The  inquiry  will  be  everywhere, 
"How  goes  the  battle  in  Indiana?"  For  as  Indiana  goes,  so  go  New- 
Jersey,  New  York,  Connecticut,  West  Virginia,  Missouri,  and  every  other 
State  necessary  to  the  election  of  a  president.  [Applause.] 

This  is  a  time  of  great  expectations.  But  those  who  prophesy  vivid 
change  and  beckon  experiment  in  new  places  are  reminded  that  their 
expectations  are  still  only  the  shadows  of  things  hoped  for,  the  sub- 
stance of  things  that  remain  to  be  seen.  It  is  to  be  hoped  that  their 
fondest  expectations  of  reinforcements  from  territory  that  has  not  gone 
nationally  Democratic  in  fifty  years  may  be  realized.  But  those  who  in 
this  season  of  midsummer  political  tempest  expect  lightning  to  strike 
in  unusual  places  are  reminded  that  it  is  still  the  safer  course  in  making 
candidates  to  consult  the  certainties  of  experience  over  the  speculations 
of  experiment,  and  wiser  to  build  in  the  light  than  on  the  lightning. 

Would  you  have  a  candidate  who,  in  character,  capacity  and  fitness, 
answers  every  test  to  which  the  most  rigid  code  can  subiect  the  hiph 


v/

honor  of  this  nomination?  Would  you  have  a  candidate  whose  command- 
ing ability  and  virile  Democracy  have  redeemed  and  made  militant  the 
Democracy  of  his  State?  Would  you  have  a  candidate  who  is  in  the 
prime  of  his  intellectual  powers  and  physical  vigor?  Would  you  have 
a  candidate  unhampered  by  faction  and  enthusiastically  supported  by 
the  united,  harmonious  Democracy  of  his  State?  Would  you  have  a 
candidate  about  whose  fidelity  to  Democratic  principles  and  loyalty  to 
Democratic  tickets  all  question  is  foreclosed  in  advance?  Would  you 
have  a  candidate  whose  State  has  borne  on  its  bosom  the  fortunes  of 
national  politics  through  nearly  one  hundred  years?  Would  you  have  a 
candidate  Avho  is  a  stranger  to  defeat,  who  wall  carry  overwhelmingly 
his  own  State  and  with  it  all  the  States  necessary  to  the  installation  of 
a  Democratic  President?  Would  you  have  a  candidate  who,  by  his  prac- 
tical sense  and  solid  wisdom  in  the  administration  of  the  high  office  of 
President,  would  render  his  party  invincible  in  the  respect,  esteem  and 
confidence  of  the  whole  country?  Such  a  candidate  the  united  Democracy 
of  Indiana  presents  to  this  Convention  in  the  person  and  character  of 
Governor  Thomas  B.  Marshall.  [Applause.]

SPEECH  OF  P.  H.  O'BBIEN. 

_--• 

MR.  P.  H.  O'BRIEN,  of  Michigan:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen, 
from  the  shores  of  Lake  Superior,  in  the  great  Peninsular  State,  I  want 
to  say  to  you,  as  a  progressive  Democrat,  that  I  believe  the  one  man 
who  makes  the  logical  appeal  to  the  progressive  people  of  our  common 
country  is  the  governor  of  New  Jersey,  and  therefore,  as  representing  a 
respectable  minority  of  the  Michigan  delegation,  we  want  to  pledge  ten 
votes  for  Governor  Wilson  on  the  first  ballot.  [Applause.] 

I  believe,  gentleman  of  the  Convention,  in  what  is  inevitable  to  every 
fair-minded  Democrat  in  the  country  who  lx?]ieves  in  progress  and  in 
patriotism  and  in  the  man  above  the  dollar,  and  in  what  is  becoming 
more  and  more  inevitable  ever}'  day  and  every  hour  and  every  minute — 
the  nomination  and  the  election  by  an  overwhelming  majority  of  the 
people  of  the  United  States  of  Governor  Woodrow  Wilson,  of  Xew  -Jer- 
sey. [Applause.] 

REMABKS  OF  JOHN  E.  KINNANE. 

MR.  JOHN  E.  KIXNAXE,  of  Michigan :  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen, 
I  also  desire  to  speak  a  few  words  on  behalf  of  delegates  from  the  State 
Of  Michigan,  and  to  say  that  a  majority  of  the  delegates  from  the 


t!74  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

jreat   Peninsular   State    favor   the   nomination   of    Hon.    Champ    Clark. 
[Applause.] 
The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  called  the   State 
of  Minnesota. 

Mr.  Alfred  Jacques,  of  Minnesota,  rose. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman 
from  Minnesota,  Mr.  Alfred  Jacques. 

SPEECH  OF  ALFRED  JACQUES. 

MR.  ALFRED  JACQUES,  of  Minnesota:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
of  the  Convention,  it  is  a  pleasure  for  me  to  stand  before  this  Conven- 
tion and  speak  in  behalf  of  the  great  State  of  Minnesota.  The  State 
of  Minnesota  will  not  feel  that  it  has  done  its  full  duty  to  its  sister 
commonwealth  unless  it  meets  its  conviction  and  seconds  the  nomination 
of  Wcodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

Minnesota  is  fortunate  in  this  respect,  that  it  has  no  individual  dele 
gates  to  be  considered  here  in  this  matter.  It  could  have  been  repre 
sented  by  me.  I  have  noticed  while  in  attendance  upon  this  Conven- 
tion, as  one  of  Minnesota 's  representatives,  that  it  is  a  common  thing 
to' have  conflicts  between  the  friends  of  the  respective  candidates  from 
the  different  States.  In  Minnesota  there  were  not  enough  Democrats  in 
opposition  to  Woodrow  Wilson  to  constitute  a  contesting  delegation. 

In  one  respect  I  can  speak  for  the  great  Northwest.  Minnesota 'L; 
Democracy  has  taken  occasion  at  different  times  to  announce  that  it  is 
a  part  of  the  aggressive  and  progressive  Bryan  Democracy  of  the  north- 
west [applause],  and  it  is  proud  and  glad  to  announce  tod^y  that  it 
stands  shoulder  to  shoulder  with  the  aggressive  and  progressive  Wilson 
Democracy  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  [Applause.]  We  were  com- 
pelled to  come  here  in  the  way  in  which  we  have,  representing  Woodrow 
Wilson,  but  not  only  is  the  Democracy  of  Minnesota  for  Woodrow  Wilson, 
but  so  is  a  large  proportion  of  the  Eepublicans  of  that  State.  [Ap- 
plause.] We  are  prepared  to  say  that  the  Republicans  of  Minnesota 
have  become  disgusted  with  the  conditions  existing  in  their  party  an'l 
are  in  favor  of  Mr.  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

We  in  Minnesota  think  we  know  what  a  Democrat  is.  Some  time  ago 
we  learned  that  there  had  been  a  house  cleaning  down  in  New  Jersey, 
and  upon  investigation  we  discovered  that  there  was  an  intelligent,  pro- 
gressive and  great  Democrat  who  did  the  house  cleaning  in  New  Jersey. 
We  came  here  to  urge  his  nomination,  and  we  knew  that  our  judgment 
of  him  was  correct  when  wo  found  the  great  State  of  Texas  standing 
\vith  us.  The  State  of  Minnesota  stands  with  the  Lone  Star  of  Texas 
[applause],  and  Woodrow  Wilson  bridges  the  great  territorial  distance 
between  us.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  called  the  State 
of  Mississippi. 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  175 

MR.  EARL  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:     Mr.  Chairman — 
THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     The  Chair  presents  Governor  Brewer, 
of  Mississippi. 

SPEECH  OF  EAEL  BEEWER. 

MR.  EARL  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  I  hail  from  that  section  of  our  great  country,  the  South, 
which,  when  we  were  seeking  to  found  a  republic  that,  uniting  the  States, 
would  stand  as  the  greatest  republic  in  the  history  of  the  world,  fur 
nished  Washington,  the  Father  of  his  country.  [Applause.] 

Again,  my  fellow  countrymen,  when  a  foreign  foe  threatened  to 
invade  our  country  and  devastate  our  homes,  and  the  necessities  of  the 
times  called  for  a  great  man,  as  a  ship  at  sea  in  a  storm  calls  for  a  pilot, 
the  attention  of  the  nation  was  called  to  the  man  of  the  hour,  and  old 
Andrew  Jackson  walked  out  as  the  shining  star,  and  all  the  people 
of  Tennessee  volunteered,  and  rallied  around  him  as  did  the  whole  nation 
to  keep  the  foot  of  a  foreign  foe  off  the  soil  which  they  regarded  as 
hallowed  ground. 

And  now,  my  fellow  countrymen,  at  a  time  when  our  people  are  over- 
burdened by  the  high  cost  of  living,  at  a  time  when  the  laws  of  the 
nation  are  so  framed  as  to  take  money  out  of  one  man's  pocket  ami 
transfer  it  to  another's,  our  country  again  calls  for  a  great  man. 

That  section  of  the  South  from  which  I  come  has  never  gone  Re- 
publican.  When  Republicanism  has  threatened  to  overthrow  the  very 
Democracy  itself,  we  have  stood  firm  and  beaten  back  the  aggressor, 
even  as  the  Rock  of  Gibraltar  resists  the  waves  of  the  sea.  -Sometimes 
on  the  morning  after  election  the  returns  from  the  respective  States  have 
shown  that  everything  has  gone  wrong  except  Mississippi.  [Applause.] 

Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  for  fifty-two  long  years  we  have  not 
come  before  a  Democratic  Convention  and  presented  a  candidate,  but 
now  we  come  and  say  we  can  furnish  you  the  man  to  lead  the  Demo- 
cratic party.  During  all  these  years  in  the  past  we  have  furnished 
you  the  votes,  and  now  when  we  ask  you  to  give  us  a  hearing,  will  you 
give  us  a  stone? 

We  tell  you  that  ;f  you  want  a  presidential  candidate  who  is  a  man 
from  the  top  of  his  head  to  the  soles  of  his  feet,  who  is  not  afflicted  with 
any  of  the  isms,  who  never  took  orders  from  Wall  Street  or  from  an 
oracle  in  the  West,  but  a  man  who  co-mes  and  gets  his  orders  from  the 
rural  districts,  from  the  country,  from  the  common  people;  if  you  want 
a  man  who  will  lower  the  cost  of  living,  and  who  will  perplex  the  Re- 
publican party  in  all  kinds  of  ways,  nominate  that  sterling  -young  man 
of  the  Soutli  who  comes  fresh  and  untarnished  from  the  people,  but  wh  i 
comes  with  a  heart  full  of  patriotism,  and  with  a  record  that  is  without 
a  blemish.  We  say  to  you  come  and  join  with  us  and  vote  for  Oscar  W. 
Underwood,  of  Alabama.  [Applause.] 


176  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  STONE,  of  Missouri  (when  the  State  of  Missouri  w;is 
called) :  Missouri  yields  to  Colorado. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  presents  Mr.  Charles  F.  Tew. 
of  Colorado.  [Applause.] 

SPEECH  OF  CHARLES  F.   TEW. 

MR.  CHARLES  F.  TEW,  of  Colorado:  Mr.  Chairman,  ladies  and  gentle- 
men, this  is  the  crisis  of  the  greatest  political  conflict  this  nation  has  ever 
seen.  This  is  a  climax  of  the  great  struggle  that  is  ever  old  and  ever 
new — government  by  the  many  or  government  by  the  few;  the  conflict 
between  the  favored  classes  and  the  toiling  thousands;  between  aris- 
tocracy upon  one  side  and  democracy  upon  the  other,  not  the  Democracy 
of  party  merely,  but  the  true  democracy  of  the  nation. 

The  great  and  growing  problem  among  the  people  is:  "Shall  the 
great  Republic  founded  upon  the  principle  and  dedicated  to  the  propo- 
sition that  all  just  powers  of  government  are  derived  from  the  consent 
of  the  governed,  live  and  flourish  or  wither  and  decay  t ' '  Shall  the 
great  hope  of  liberty  and  equality  here  and  everywhere  live  on.  or  shall 
it  descends  to  a  name  and  semblance,  a  sham  and  pretense,  like  sounding 
brass  and  a  tinkling  cymbal? 

The  great  commons  of  the  country — the  real  democracy — knows  that 
our  ship  of  state  has  drifted  far  to  sea  and  demands  that  she  be  now 
returned  unto  her  true  course.  There  is  an  awakening  of  that  great 
giant,  public  opinion,  demanding  action.  There  can  be  no  compromise 
and  no  procrastination.  There  can  be  no  faltering  now — hesitate,  and 
your  epitaph  is  upon  the  wall  like  at  the  feast  of  Belshazzar.  The 
Democracy  of  the  nation  has  already  spoken,  you  may  write  your  plat- 
form here,  but  it  has  been  already  written  in  the  hearts  of  patriots 
and  trumpeted  upon  the  lips  of  the  thousands.  Our  banner  must  bear 
the  legend:  "Give  the  Government  back  to  the  people." 

That's  an  "ensign  as  noble  and  as  grand  as  ever  in  motto  floated 
above  a  nation's  arms  or  glittered  on  Crusader's  shield."  [Applause.] 

The  conditions  are  ripe  for  the  grandest  victory  that  right  and 
justice  ever  achieved  over  the  Philistines  of  power.  Our  enemies  divided 
on  this  great  issue  rend  themselves  asunder.  A  house  divided  against 
itself  cannot  stand. 

This  is  the  people 's  inning ;  it  is  the  people 's  year.  Their  mandates 
are  too  clear  to  be  misunderstood,  too  emphatic  to  be  denied.  They  re- 
quire that  we  float  the  old  banner,  stand  true  to  the  old  principles 
and  that  we  seal  the  promise  by  the  nomination  of  a  leader  who  has 
been  time  tried  and  seasoned  in  battle  for  them.  They  demand  a 
man  of  intelligence  and  integrity,  a  man  of  experience  not  in  theory 
alone  but  in  actual  contact  with  public  affairs — a  time-tried  and  true 
Democrat  in  both  words  and  action,  a  man  of  the  stamp  of  that  old 
sire  of  the  Democratic  party  who  penned  the  great  declaration  of  basic 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  177 

principles  of  free  government  and  of  that  defender  of  those  doctrines 
who  ' '  stood  at  the  helm  of  American  diplomacy  and  guided  that  craft 
through  the  hissing  storms  and  tempest  of  rebellion  into  the  harbor  of 
peace" — the  lank  rail  splitter  of  Illinois.  Such  a  man  brings  old 
Missouri,  a  man  rich  in  years  of  public  life — without  a  scar  upon  his 
record,  without  a  tarnish  on  his  name,  a  war-horse  of  Democracy  in 
season  and  out,  fair  weather  and  foul.  He  is  all  this  in  both  words 
and  deeds.  He  is  a  leader  in  the  House  of  Representatives,  upon  the 
record  of  which  Democracy  will  elect  the  next  President  of  the  United 
States.  He  is  the  man  who  did  so  much  to  banish  C'zarism  from  the 
Speaker's  chair  and  re-established  the  House  as  the  American  Commons. 

Such  a  man  is  for  the  East  as  well  as  the  West,  for  the  North  as 
well  as  the  South.  We  know  him  and  we  like  him.  He  is  as  warm- 
hearted as  Baltimore  and  as  generous  as  an  irrigated  harvest. 

In  the  name  of  the  West,  the  Centennial  State — Colorado — seconds 
the  nomination  for  candidate  as  President  of  the  Republic  that  true  an-1 
tried  tribune  of  the  people,  that  son.  of  the  soil  of  Missouri,  Hou. 
Champ  Clark,  of  Pike.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

SPEECH  OF  S.  J.  DOYLE. 

MR.  S.  J.  DOYLE,  of  North  Dakota  (when  the  State  of  North  Da- 
kota was  called)  :  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  in 
making  a  brief  statement  defining  the  position  of  the  North  Dakota 
delegation,  it  is  necessary  for  me  to  read  a  letter  which  I  received  from 
the  distinguished  gentleman  who  was  North  Dakota's  choice,  and  under 
whose  instructions  I  came  here.  If  you  will  be  patient,  I  will  take  but 
little  of  your  time,  for  I  assure  you  I  am  as  tired  as  you  are.  The 
letter  which  I  wish  to  read  is  as  follows: 

"S.  J.  DOYLE, 

"Chairman  North  Dakota  Delegation, 

"Baltimore,  Md. 
"My  Dear  Sir: 

"I  am  grateful  for  the  compliment  paid  me  by  our  fair  State  in  urg- 
ing my  candidacy  for  the  high  office  of  President  of  the  United  States. 
At  this  time,  however,  when  the  cause  of  the  people  is  at  stake,  the 
strength  of  Progressive  Democracy  should  not  be  divided.  I  therefore 
release  the  North  Dakota  delegation  from  its  pledge  to  me,  with  full 
confidence  that  you  will  act  together  in  the  interest  of  true  Democracy 
and  in  accordance  with  the  progressive  spirit  of  the  age. 

"Very  sincerely  yours, 

"JOHN  BURKE." 

Gentlemen   of   the   Convention,   the   North    Dakota   delegation    came 

here  under  instructions  to  cast  its  ballot  In  this  Convention  for  North 


178  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Dakota 's  most  distinguished  son  as  its  choice  for  the  nomination  at 
the  hands  of  this  Convention  for  the  office  of  President  of  the  United 
States.  Those  instructions  told  us  to  vote  for  him  until  such  time 
as  we  were  released  by  him,  or  until  such  time  as  in  the  best  judgment 
of  a  majority  of  the  delegates  we  believed  his  choice  by  this  Convention 
to  be  impossible.  But  those  instructions  went  even  further  than  that. 
We  were  instructed  that  when  the  time  came,  if  it  did  come,  when 
we  should  change  from  Governor  Burke,  then  we  were  to  cast  our  votes 
for  the  other  candidate,  whoever  he  might  be.  who  in  our  judgment  best 
represented  the  principles  of  progressive  Democracy,  whom  the  people 
of  the  great  Northwest  had  con:e  to  understand  and  to  love. 

Carrying  out  those  instructions,  after  having  fully  discussed  them 
and  the  situation  with  our  Governor,  and  pursuant  to  the  spirit  of  those 

I   instructions,  and  pursuant  to  the  spirit  of  the  letter  which  I  have  read. 

?  when  the  roll  of  States  is  called  and  we  are  asked  to  designate  our 
choice,  the  ten  votes  from  Xorth  Dakota  will  be  cast  for  that  candi- 
date whcse  personality  as  we  believe  most  clearly  typifies  the  principles 
of  progressive  Democracy,  the  great  champion  of  the  people  from  the 
State  of  New  Jersey,  Woodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.] 
The  calling  of  the  roll  was  resumed. 

NOMINATING    SPEECH    OF   M.    A.   DAUGHEBTY. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  (when  the  State  of  Ohio  was  called): 
The  Chair  presents  to  the  Convention  Hon.  M.  A.  Daugherty,  of  Ohio. 

MR.  M.  A.  DAUGHERTY,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman,  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  in  the  religious  world,  at  temple  and  shrine,  men  are  ac- 
customed to  renew  and  nourish  their  faith  in  Church  and  Creed.  Balti- 
more, beautiful  Baltimore,  near  the  Nation's  Capital;  Baltimore,  proud 
metropolis  of  that  great  State  in  which  religious  freedom  wr.s  first 
proclaimed  and  then  irade  secure  on  the  North  American  Continent ; 
Baltimore,  out  of  whose  splendid  harbors  imperial  commerce  moves, 
and  sailing  every  sea.  enters  every  market  of  the  globe;  Baltimore, 
southern  surs  and  northern  skies  blend  above  and  bless  her  like  the 
mingling  melodies  of  "My  Maryland"  and  "The  Star  Spangled  Ban 
ner";  Baltimore,  whoso  chronicles  are  luminous  in  victorious  and  in- 
spiring traditions  of  the  old  historic  party  of  the  people;  Baltimore, 
indeed,  well  deserves  to  be  the  perpetual  pilgrimage  of  the  National 
Democracy.  [Applause.  ] 

If  time  sometimes  brings  its  own  revenues,  it  brings  its  own  rewards 
and  compensations  in  rich  abundance  too  as  the  eternal  years  roll  on. 
A  half  century  and  more  ago,  in'  gloom  and  sorrow,  Baltimore  saw  the 
Democracy  divide  within  l;er  gates  and  power  fall  from  its  enfeebled 
pft  -:•.  Haltimore  rejoices  now  in  the  hearts  of  all  her  toiling  tlious:uid&gt;. 
her  gifted  sons  and  her  queenly  unughteis,  at  that  perfect  reunion  \vhk-!i 
foretells  Democracy 's  coming  triumph  and  restoration. 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  179 

The  encircling  years  in  their  immortal  justice  are  bearing  back  to 
the  Democracy  the  scepter  of  its  former  rule  and  glory,  its  rightful 
heritage.  In  1860  the  slavery  of  a  race  for  which  it  was  in  no  wise 
responsible  overthrew  the  theretofore  invincible  Democracy,  although  it 
was  the  genius  and  builder  of  the  Republic.  In  1912  the  strife  of 
plundering  groups  of  special  privilege  of  its  own  creation  shattered 
the  Republican  party  to  atoms,  and  before  the  coming  ides  of  next 
November  the  contrast  and  the  parallel  will  be  complete.  [Applause.] 

Mortal  men  alone  do  not  determine  the  rise  and  fall,  the  advance  and 
retrogression  of  political  parties;  other  causes  are  more  potential.  Over 
and  above  the  noise  and  din,  the  tumult  and  the  fury  of  party  conflict 
and  party  struggle,  the  red  fire  and  marching  columns,  the  thrilling 
oratory  and  picturesque  literature  of  political  campaigns  there  reign 
the  moral  forces  which  must  be  reckoned  with  for  they  are  supreme  and 
will  and  do  assert  their  dominion  in  the  world.  [Applause.]  More 
persuasive  than  party  platforms,  more  effective  than  party  enthusiasm 
and  party  loyalty,  stronger  than  all  party  organization,  greater  than  all 
the  instrumentalities  and  activities  that  appear  in  the  political  arena 
and  more  influential  than  all  of  them  combined  is  the  majestic  supremacy 
of  the  fundamental  and  immutable  laws  of  moral  order  that  govern  the 
world,  for  these  men  cannot  set  aside,  political  parties  cannot  sus- 
pend, Governments  cannot  change.  Like  individuals  and  nations,  political 
parties  walk  in  the  shadow  of  the  power  of  the  Almighty;  their  destiny 
is  cast  in  the  molds  of  Omnipotence.  Economic  and  governmental  issues 
alone  have  not  made  the  Democracy  resolute,  militant,  invulnerable  and 
united  it  as  it  was  never  united  in  all  its  history;  the  moral  law  has 
contributed  its  resistless  impulses.  Disorganized,  disrupted,  fallen  so  low 
that  there  are  none  so  poor  as  to  do  it  reverence,  a  leaderless  and  life- 
less foe,  degrading  the  Republic  in  the  eyes  of  the  world,  openly  assault- 
ing representative  government,  challenging  the  capacity  of  the  people  for 
self-government,  torn  by  dissensions,  the  prey  of  rival  factions,  chained 
to  the  rock  like  the  fabled  Prometheus,  the  vultures  of  privilege  that 
fed  and  fattened  upon  its  policies  now  plucking  its  withering  bones,  the 
thunderbolts  of  the  wrath  of  the  Most  High  have  descended  upon  the 
Republican  party  and  it  now  stands  before  all  the  world  stricken  with 
the  Divine  vengeance  like  the  builders  of  the  Tower  of  Babel.  {Applause.  | 

Standing  at  the  base  of  the  Pryamids  of  the  Nile,  the  great  Na 
poleon,  inciting  his  veteran  legions  to  renewed  deeds  of  valor,  said: 
"Soldiers  of  France!  Forty  centuries  now  look  down  upon  you." 
More  than  one  hundred  million  American  people  are  looking  to  this 
Convention,  to  you,  the  chosen  and  accredited  icprcscntatives  of  the 
greatest  political  party  of  the  world,  comprising  within  its  ranks  more 
than  seven  million  voters,  assembled  to  set  in  motion  and  to  exercise 
some  of  the  functions  of  representative  government  where  the  popular 
will,  that  potent  and  irresistible  influence  in  Republics,  first  begins  to 
assume  the  form  and  dignity  of  law,  not  only  for  their  deliverance 


180  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

from  the  injustice  and  oppression,  the  extortion  and  the  tyranny  of  Re- 
publican conduct,  but  to  preserve  the  best  and  fairest  form  of  Govern- 
ment that  the  wisdom  of  man  under  the  providence  of  God  ever  es- 
tablished. [Applause.]  And  your  sense  of  responsibility  will'  bo 
quickened  and  keenly  stirred  in  the  reflection  that  the  future  of  your 
country  is  about  to  be  committed  to  the  guiding  brain  and  conscience  of 
the  Democratic  party,  that  your  nominee  will  become  its  President  for 
four  years  and  that  the  platform  of  principles  which  you  promulgate 
will  be  the  accepted  policies  and  written  into  the  laws  of  the  Republic. 
[Applause.] 

;  In  the  last  ten  decades  in  National  Democratic  Conventions  Ohio  was 
only  a  Republican  State  with  no  impressive  voice  in  Democratic  councils. 
To  you,  today,  Ohio  pleads  the  right  and  prays  the  privilege  of  saluta- 
tion from  a  Democratic  commonwealth  redeemed  and  regenerated  by 
Ohio's  great  Democratic  Governor;  who  never  lost  a  political  battle; 
who  never  led  his  party  to  defeat;  who  always  carried  its  banner  to 
splendid  victory ;  who  transformed  the  State  from  the  Dead  Sea  of 
Republicanism  to  the  Paradise  of  Democracy  and,  not  by  any  transitory 
issue,  permanently  placed  the  State  in  the  Democratic  column  confirmed 
by  decisive  numbers  in  two  successive  elections  and  firmly  anchored  there 
by  more  than  one  hundred  thousand  Democratic  majority;  who  crushed 
and  strangled  the  Republican  state  machine,  the  most  powerful  and 
the  most  corrupt  of  modern  days,  with  its  poisonous  fangs  penetrating 
almost  every  department  and  agency  of  the  State  Government  and 
defiantly  using  the  State  Treasury  to  enrich  dishonest  officials,  its  own 
managers  and  financial  institutions  bound  to  it  by  the  strong  ties  of 
pecuniary  advantage  and  gain ;  who  exacts  absolute  honesty  and  rigid 
economy  in  public  affairs;  Avho  has  purified  the  public  service  in  Ohio, 
driven  corruption  from  its  public  life,  stimulated  and  uplifted  with  new 
and  healthful  tone  and  vigor  the  civic  standard  of  its  citizenship  and 
under  whose  leadership  Democracy  in  Ohio  has  become  the  protector  and 
evangel  of  the  aroused  and  dominant  moral  sentiment  of  its  people, 
that  sentiment  which  is  the  onward  and  upward  and  essential  spirit 
of  representative  government.  [Applause.] 

Taxation  and  revenue  have  been  the  most  perplexing  problems  of 
government  cvor  since  their  institution  among  men.  Taxation  and 
revenue  have  called  into  exercise  and  developed  to  the  utmost  the  intel- 
lectual powers  of  the  wisest  men  and  greatest  statesmen  of  the  world  in 
all  ages.  Taxation  and  revenue  have  been  subjects  of  ever  growing 
and  never  ending  interest  to  the  people  of  every  land  ever  since  time 
began  and  will  so  continue  until  time  shall  be  no  more. 

Ohio 's  great  Democratic  Governor  has  planned  and  put  into  execu- 
tion in  that  State  a  system  of  taxation  and  revenue  so  just,  so  simple,  so 
comprehensive,  so  efficient  that  the  burdens  of  government  are  borne 
equally  by  all  property,  whether  corporate  or  individual,  with  a  maxi- 
mum one  per  cent  limitation  of  assessment  that  insures  the  placing  of  all 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  181 

values  upon  the  taxing  lists  and  incites  and  induces  all  public  officials 
charged  with  responsibility  to  the  most  careful  scrutiny  of  all  public 
expenditures,  a  system  of  taxation  and  revenue  that  marks  its  author 
as  a  constructive  statesman  of  the  first  rank.  [Applause.] 

Compensation  to  the  toilers  injured  in  workshop  and  factory  and 
to  their  dependent  families  if  accident  ends  in  the  tragedy  of  death, 
without  waging  an  unequal  contest  for  recompense  in  the  courts  with 
all  the  uncertainties,  expense  and  delay  attending  upon  the  law,  appeals 
to  every  man  whose  heart  is  not  closed  to  misery  and  wrong.  Ohio's 
great  Democratic  Governor  outlined  and  approved  a  workmen's  com- 
pensation act,  the  most  advanced,  and  which  promises  to  be  the  most 
beneficent  that  obtains  in  any  state  or  land. 

Progression  is  the  order  of  the  day;  it  is  borne  on  every  breeze  and 
warmed  by  every  sun.  The  just  demand  for  social  and  industrial 
justice  to  the  great  mass  of  mankind  is  universal  and  imperative.  Men 
were  never  so  powerful  as  they  are  today;  the  very  earth  seems  to 
vibrate  with  the  energies  men  have  put  into  motion  and  employ.  Govern- 
ments cannot  lag;  they  must  keep  step  to  the  music  of  progress. 

In  this  land  Democracy  is  progressive  always;  revolutionary  never. 
?t  builds  on  settled  and  tried  foundations  and  not  on  the  shifting  sands 
of  storm  and  tempest.  It  rests  its  faith  in  the  strength  and  not  in  the 
weaknesses,  in  the  virtues  and  not  in  the  passions  of  men.  It  allays 
rather  than  fans  into  lurid  flame  the  slumbering  fires  of  discontent. 

Guided  by  its  great  Democratic  Governor,  Ohio  has  accomplished 
more  real  and  true  progression,  the  progression  that  builds  up  and  does 
not  destroy  and  that  places  Ohio  first  in  the  advancing  progression  of- 
states,  than  any  other  commonwealth,  and  accomplished  too,  and  this 
has  been  its  most  distinguishing  feature,  along  and  within  the  boundary 
lines  of  existing  constitutional  provisions,  for  he  believes  in  the  estab- 
lished institutions  of  his  country,  has  not  lost  faith  in  representative 
government  and  is  unwilling  to  exchange  it  for  the  legends  and  the 
fables  or  the  memorials  and  the  ruins  of  so  called  pure  Democracy, 
[Applause.] 

No  man  can  take  the  oath  of  office  as  President  of  the  United  States 
who  does  not  believe  in  representative  government,  because  every  letter 
and  line  and  sentence  of  that  imperishable  document  speaks  and  breathes 
the  very  spirit  and  soul  of  a  representative  Democracy.  The  life  and 
achievements  of  Ohio 's  great  Democratic  Governor  illustrate  the  pos- 
sibilities and  the  opportunities  of  American  citizenship,  for  we  see  the 
farmer's  son,  the  country  schoolboy,  the  college  student,  the  struggling 
lawyer,  the  accomplished  judge,  the  counsellor  of  a  President  in  the 
cabinet  of  the  Nation,  the  Attorney  General  with  profound  legal  learning 
and  inexorable  logic  successfully  urging  the  greatest  court  of  the  world 
to  render  the  first  decree  vitalizing  the  anti-trust  laws  enacted  by  an 
American  Congress  and  who  is  again  summoned  by  the  assembled 
Governors  of  States,  and  he  responds  to  the  call,  to  speak  and  plead  in 


182  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  TJII: 

the  same  great  tribunal  for  the  preservation  and  maintenance  of  the 
rights  and  integrity  of  the  States  against  the  constant  encroachments 
of  Federal  power  and  Federal  courts,  hidden  under  cover  of  corporate 
hostility  to  the  regulation  of  rates  by  state  railway  commissions. 
[Applause.] 

Selected  by  the  Department  of  Justice,  because  of  his  recognized 
abilities  to  aid  in  the  enforcement  of  Anti-Trust  laws,  he  earnestly 
recommends  and  urges  that  the  criminal  provisions  of  the  statute  be 
employed  against  the  individuals  shielding  themselves  behind  corporate 
names,  declaring  that  guilt  is  always  personal,  but  he  was  promptly 
advised  that  his  services  were  no  longer  needed,  because  he  had  com- 
mitted the  unpardonable  sin  of  discovering  that  the  chief  offender  was 
a  Presidential  adviser  stretching  his  feet  under  the  council  table  of  an 
eiratic  and  bombastic,  splenetic  and  pragmatic  Republican  President. 
[Applause.] 

There  is  no  envy  in  the  hearts  of  Ohio  Democrats;  they  delight 
to  honor  the  distinguished  sons  of  other  States  whose  names  have  been 
presented  to  this  Convention  for  nomination  to  the  Presidency  of  the 
United  States.  But  in  availability,  in  merit,  in  mental  and  moral 
equipment,  in  the  union  of  every  quality  of  leadership  and  statesman- 
ship. Ohio  does  not  yield  to  any,  for  there  stands  the  most  commanding 
figure  in  the  public  life  of  this  land  today.  [Applause.] 

Legitimate  industry  will  not  halt,  honest  business  will  not  tremble, 
but  the  sluggish  currents  of  commerce  and  trade  will  leap  and  bound 
responsive  to  the  pulsations  of  a  new  life  when  his  nomination  and 
election  are  announced,  while  trust  and  monopoly  then  will  know  that 
their  death  knell  has  been  sounded  for  the  sympathies  of  this  great  and 
good  man  are  centered  about  the  ' '  short  and  simple  annals  of  the 
poor."  With  him  it  is  the  conviction  of  a  keen  and  ynerring  intellect 
sustained  by  unfaltering  purpose  too,  that  the  contentment  and  happi- 
ness of  millions  will  be  promoted  when  the  men  who  carry  on  their 
hands  and  faces  from  their  daily  toil  the  soot  and  the  grime  of  factories, 
the  men  who  delve  into  the  earth  in  search  of  its  hidden  treasures,  the 
men  who  stand  at  the  blistering  furnace  fires,  the  men  who  make  the 
"sparks  fly  from  the  smitten  steel,  the  men  who  guide  lever  and  wheel 
on  land  and  sea,  the  men  who  toil  in  the  open  beneath  the  burning  suns 
of  summer  and  face  the  cutting  winds  of  winter,  the  men  who  turn  the 
rich  soil  to  the  sun  to  reap  the  golden  harvest,  all  shall  be  permitted 
to  enjoy  the  fruits  of  their  labors  undiminished  by  the  exactions  of  an 
intolerable  Republican  monopoly  and  free  from  the  extortions  of  an 
odious  and  hated  Republican  tariff.  [Applause.] 

If  you  prefer  a  political  leader  whose  name  is  always  associated  with 

victory  and  never  with  defeat ;  if  you  wish  to  choose  a  Democrat  loyal 

and  devoted  to  the  cardinal  doctrines  of  Democratic  faith;   if  you  are 

Mling    to   trust   the    future   of   your   party   and   your   country    to    the

Ohio,  child  of  old  Virginia;  Ohio  with  its  homes,  its  schools  and  its

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  Oklahoma  was 
called. 

Mr.   Thomas  P.  Gore,  of  Oklahoma,  rose. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  now 
present  Senator  Gore  of  Oklahoma.  [Applause.] 

SPEECH  OF  THOMAS  P.  GOEE. 

Mi:.  THOMAS  P.  GORE,  of  Oklahoma:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention, 
I  have  too  much  respect  for  this  great  Democratic  Convention  to  levy 
a  high  tax  upon  your  patience  at  this  unseemly  hour.  I  speak  in 
beiialf  of  a  portion  of  the  Oklahoma  delegation.  The  Democracy  is  as 
united  as  one  man  in  desiring  the  election  of  a  Democratic  President. 
The  Democracy  is  as  united  as  one  man  in  desiring  the  nomination  of 
a  man  who  is  able  to  win  and  who  is  worthy  to  win.  We  have  a 
splendid  array  of  talent  and  of  statesmanship  from  which  to  make  our 
selection.  We  differ  temporarily  in  our  choice  between  these  distin- 
guished and  deserving  Democrats,  but  our  differences  are  only  transient. 
They  are  as  fleeting  as  the  clouds,  as  evanescent  as  the  mists  of  the 
morning.  When  the  morrow  comes,  the  Democracy  will  be  not  only 
united  but  will  be  unanimous  in  support  of  the  choice  of  this  Convention. 
[Applause.] 

But  more  important  than  the  candidate  is  the  cause  which  he  repre- 
sents. More  important  than  the  President  himself  are  the  'principles 
for  which  he  stands  and  which  he  would  enforce.  We  must,  my  fellow 
Democrats,  nominate  for  the  Presidency  a  man  who  embodies  the  very 
spirit  of  Jeffersonian  Democracy,  one  who  believes  in  the  divine  right 
of  the  people  to  govern  themselves^  one  who  is  opposed  to  the  existing 
system  of  tariffs  and  trusts,  which  enables  one  set  of  men  to  get  some- 
thing for  nothing,  while  obliging  other  men  to  part  with  something  for 
nothing.  We  must  nominate  a  man  who,  in  the  great  struggle  between 
the  privileged  classes  upon  the  one  hand  and  the  unprivileged  masses 
upon  the  other,  stands  for  equal  and  exact  justice  to  all  and  favoritism 
to  none;  one  who  believes  that  the  supreme  object  of  human  government 
is  to  secure  justice  among  men;  one  who  believes  that  unto  every  man 
should  be  rendered  his  due,  who  will  see  to  it  that  the  high  and  the 


184  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 


get  their  dues,  nothing  more;  who  will  see  to  it  that  the  poor  and 
the  humble  get  their  dues,  nothing  less. 

We  must  nominate  a  man  who  knows  that  — 
"Through  the  ages  one  increasing  purpose  runs 

And  the  thoughts  of  men  are  widened  with  the  process  of  the  suns." 

But  it  is  not  sufficient  to  nominate  a  man  who  deserves  to  win.  We 
have  done  that  twice,  thrice,  four  times  in  the  recent  history  of  this 
Republic,  and  yet  we  have  failed.  We  must  nominate  a  candidate  in 
whom  ability  unites  with  availability.  Let  iis  concede  that  these  dis- 
tinguished Democrats  all  possess  the  requisite  ability.  The  only  point 
for  rs  then  to  consider  and  determine  is  their  respective  availability. 

My  fellow  Democrats,  availability  consists  of  two  elements,  the 
capacity  of  the  candidate  to  poll  the  full  strength  of  his  own  party,  and 
his  capacity  to  win  votes  from  the  opposing  party.  We  ought  to  nom- 
inate a  candidate  who  can  secure  the  entire  Democratic  vote  of  the 
nation,  for  we  cannot  afford  to  trade  Democratic  votes  even  for  Repub- 
lican votes.  We  must  have  boot  when  it  comes  to  bargaining  of  that 
description. 

But  admit  that  all  the  candidates  can  poll  the  full  Democratic  vote 
in  the  United  States.  That  still  is  not  sufficient.  During  the  last  four 
campaigns  we  have  had  the  best  principles,  we  have  had  the  best  plat- 
forms, we  have  had  the  best  cause,  we  have  had  the  best  candidates;  we 
have  had  everything  that  we  needed,  excepting  only  votes,  and  I  might 
add,  campaign  funds.  [Applause.] 

The  candidate  wrhose  nomination  I  shall  second,  I  believe  equally  with 
any  other  can  secure  the  united  vote  of  a  united  Democracy,  and  I 
believe  more  than  any  other  candidate  perhaps  can  secure  the  inde- 
pendent vote  of  the  Republic,  that  vast  section  of  independent  voters 
who  occupy  the  borderland  between  the  Democratic  and  the  Republican 
parties,  and  who  have  elected  our  Presidents  in  the  past  and  will  elect 
them  in  the  future.  The  candidate  whose  nomination  I  second  can, 
I  believe,  more  than  any  other,  best  secure  the  disaffected  Republican 
votes  in  the  United  States;  and,  blessed  be  God,  there  are  many  dis- 
affected Republicans  in  the  United  States  today,  and  I  trust  that  the 
Lord  will  increase  their  tribe.  [Applause.] 

During  the  last  three  and  one  half  years  President  Taft  has  been 
as  busy  as  a  bee  carrying  out  the  policies  of  Theodore  Roosevelt  —  on  a 
stretcher.  [Laughter.]  Why  do  I  say  that  the  candidate  whose  nomina- 
tion I  second  can  secure  the  disaffected  Republican  independent  voters? 
I  say  it  because  he  has  secured  their  votes.  In  the  State  of  New 
Jersey  he  converted  a  Republican  majority  of  more  than  82,000  into 
a  Democratic  majority  of  more  than  41,000.  [Applause.]  When  I  hear 
Republican  senators  say  that  they  will  support  Wilson  against  Taft,  I 
am  persuaded  of  his  availability.  When  I  hear  Republican  senators 
saying  that  Republican  States  will  go  for  Wilson  by  30,000  over  T;ift, 
T  am  convinced  of  his  availability.  [Applause.] 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  185 

My  fellow  Democrats,  I  want  this  country  to  go  Democratic  from 
the  eastern  to  the  western  sea.  I  want  Maine  to  go  Democratic,  I  want 
Massachusetts  to  go  Democratic,  I  want  Michigan  and  Minnesota  to  go 
Democratic,  I  want  the  Dakotas,  Montana,  Idaho  and  Washington  to  go 
Democratic.  I  want  Colorado,  Illinois,  Iowa  and  Pennsylvania  to  go 
Democratic.  [Applause.]  If  you  will  nominate  Woodrow  Wilson  there 
will  be  only  six  safe  Republican  States  in  the  United  States  of  America. 
[Applause.]  The  rest  will  either  be  Democratic  or  doubtful. 

My  fellow  Democrats,  I  am  looking  deeper  into  the  future  than 
the  pending  contest.  Euin  and  disintegration  have  been  the  fate  of  every 
conservative  party  in  the  history  of  this  Eepublic.  The  Federalist  party 
was  overwhelmed  by  the  rising  tide  of  Jeffersonian  Democracy.  Jeffer- 
son deliberately  planned  the  execution  of  the  Federalist  party.  The 
Whig  party  was  engulfed  by  the  rising  tide  of  progress  and  of  liberalism 
in  the  United  States.  The  proud,  imperious  Republican  party,  whose 
word  but  yesterday  might  have  stood  against  the  world,  now  lies  so  poor 
that  none  will  do  it  reverence.  The  proud,  arrogant  and  omnipotent 
Republican  party  is  today  stranded,  broken  between  the  rock  of  Taft 
stand-pattism  on  the  one  hand  and  the  whirlpool  of  Rooseveltian  radical- 
ism on  the  other.  There  must  be  and  there  will  be  a  progressive  party 
in  the  United  States.  Shall  that  party  be  the  Democratic  party  or  shall 
it  be  the  Roosevelt  party?  Either  the  Democracy  or  the  Roosevelt  party 
will  be  the  progressive  party  of  the  nation.  Which  shall  it  be?  This 
Convention  must  answer  that  question  whether  it  would  answer  it  or 
not.  You  cannot  escape  the  answer.  If  we  adopt  a  progressive  platform 
and  nominate  a  candidate  who  is  neither  a  reactionary  upon  the  one  hand 
nor  a  revolutionary  upon  the  other,  a  candidate  who  opposes  the  con- 
servatism which  means  stagnation,  as  he  opposes  the  radicalism  which 
means  convulsion,  one  who  will  not  embrace  the  new  on  account  of  its 
novelty  nor  reject  the  old  on  account  of  its  antiquity;  one  who  embodies 
and  typifies  that  spirit  of  progress  which  has  led  the  race  from  the  cave- 
dweller  unto  the  summit  of  modern  civilization.  If  we  meet  our  duty 
we  can  fulfill  our  destiny. 

It  is  not  for  me  to  suggest,  but  it  is  for  you  to  consider  if  you 
will:  If  to  the  distracted  and  tormented  Republican  party  we  desire 
to  present  a  united  and  triumphant  Democracy,  conceding  the  splendid 
record  represented  here  by  all  the  candidates,  then  nominate  Wilson  for 
the  Presidency;  nominate  one  of  the  other  candidates  for  the  Vice- 
Presidency,  and  advance  another  to  the  Speakership  of  the  House. 
That  is  for  you  to  determine.  The  Democracy  is  united,  and  united  it 
is  triumphant. 

Nominate  for  the  Presidency,  my  fellow  Democrats,  a  man  who  is 
devoted  to  the  right  against  the  wrong,  who  is  devoted  to  justice  against 
injustice,  who  is  devoted  to  liberty  against  slavery,  who  is  devoted  to 
man  as  against  mammon,  who  is  devoted  to  good  government  as  against 
the  grafter  and  his  graft.  Nominate  for  the  Presidency  of  the  United 


186  OFFICIAL  PBOCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

States  this  day  a  man  who  will  consecrate  the. highest  talents  with  which 
the  Lord  God  Almighty  has  endowed  him  to  the  service  and  glory  of  this 
the  grandest  Republic  that  ever  stood  upon  "this  bank  and  shoal  of 
time." 

Such  a  man  I  tender  to  you  in  Governor  Woodrow  "Wilson  of  the  State 
of  New  Jersey.  [Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  presents  to  the  Conven- 
tion Representative  Scott  Ferris,  of  Oklahoma. 

SPEECH  OF  SCOTT  FERRIS. 

MR.  SCOTT  FERRIS,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  fellow  Democrats, 
and  gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  shall  at  this  late  hour  detain  you 
but  a  moment.  I  wish,  on  behalf  of  one-half  of  the  Oklahoma  delega- 
tion, to  second  the  nomination  of  a  man  I  have  known  all  my  life.  For 
25  years  the  man  I  shall  name  has  each  day  fought  the  battles  of 
Democracy  from  one  end  of  this  country  to  the  other.  [Applause.] 

When  the  Democrats  were  in  trouble  in  Maine  he  journeyed  there 
to  help  them.  When  the  Democrats  were  in  trouble  in  Texas  he  jour- 
neyed there  to  help  them.  When  the  Democrats  were  in  trouble  in  my 
own  State  he  journeyed  there  to  help  them.  When  the  Democrats  were 
in  trouble  in  the  60th  Congress,  with  Joe  Cannon  and  57  Repub- 
lican majority,  he  was  there  to  help  them.  [Applause.]  When  the 
Democrats  were  in  trouble  in  the  61st  Congress,  with  Joe  Cannon  and 
a  Republican  Congress,  he  was  there  to  iielp  them.  [Applause.].  In 
the  62nd  Congress,  when  the  Democrats,  through  his  wise  and  benefi- 
cent leadership,  had  71  majority,  he  was  there  to  help  them.  [Ap- 
plause.] Not  forgetful  of  the  platform  pledges,  true  to  organized 
labor,  true  to  the  American  farmer,  true  to  the  American  consumer,  the 
man  I  desire  to  second  the  nomination  of  is  none  other  than  dear  old 
Champ  Clark.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  the  State  of 
Pennsylvania  was  called. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  present 
Congressman  Palmer,  of  Pennsylvania. 

SPEECH  OF  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman  and 
gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  I  rise  to  second  the  nomination  of 
Woodrow  Wilson.  Born  in  the  Old  Dominion,  whose  proudest  boast 
proclaims  her  the  mother  of  Presidents,  reared  to  manhood  in  the 
Empire  State  of  the  South,  trained  in  the  science  of  government  in 
this  border  city,  where  four  Democratic  Presidents  have  been  named, 
he  brought  the  Democracy  of  his  early  environment  and  education  to 
the  attainment  of  truer  American  ideals  for  a  great  institution  of 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  187 

learning  in  the  North  and  the  accomplishment  of  real  government  of 
the  people  in  the  most  sorely  despoiled  commonwealth  upon  this  con- 
tinent. 

The  State  of  Pennsylvania,  long  pillaged  by  the  blighting  hand  of 
privilege  and  now  shamefully  browbeaten  in  the  name  of  reform,  emerg- 
ing from  the  dark  hour  which  surely  precedes  the  dawn,  turns  with 
hope  and  confidence  to  the  rising  sun,  where  the  "scholar  in  polities" 
has  lighted  up  the  whole  horizon.  We  adopt  Woodrow  Wilson  as  our 
own,  and  with  him  to  lead,  Pennsylvania  can  and  will  be  redeemed. 
[Applause.] 

Pennsylvania's  appeal  should  not  be  measured  by  results  in  the  throt- 
tled past,  but  by  the  assurance  of  the  open  future.  Without  hope  of 
reward  or  expectation  of  victory,  a  half  million  men  in  that  State  have 
remained  true  to  the  historic  principles  of  the  Democratic  party,  and 
now  with  the  organization  responsive  to  the  people's  will  and  in  full 
sympathy  with  the  progressive  sentiment  of  the  State,  it  becomes  no 
mere  figure  of  speech  to  voice  the  prophecy  that  Pennsylvania  will  re- 
sume her  early  place  among  Democratic  States.  [Applause.] 

But  I  shall  make  my  appeal  not  alone  in  the  name  of  the  progres- 
sive Democracy  of  the  State  for  which  I  speak,  but  in  the  name  also 
of  the  young  men  everywhere,  whose  ideals,  purposes  and  accomplish- 
ments in  every  State  will  parallel  those  of  the  young  men  of  Pennsyl- 
vania, who  have  recently  shown  their  tremendous  power  in  effecting 
clean  politics  and  honest  government. 

The  most  significant  condition  in  present  day  American  politics  is 
the  tendency  of  the  rising  generation  of  men  to  blaze  a  new  trail  for 
political  action  in  the  future. 

Let  no  man  deceive  himself  as  to  the  meaning  of  the  movement 
which  swept  like  the  torrent  of  a  tidal  wave  across  the  country  in  the 
fall  of  1910  and  maintained  its  height  practically  unshaken  in  the 
elections  of  1911.  It  'was  no  partisan  victory  in  the  old  fashioned 
sense.  Let  no  great  leader  of  any  party  or  faction  lay  the  flattering 
unction  to  his  soul  that  then  the  country  responded  with  loud  resound- 
ing voice  to  his  appeal  for  the  enforcement  of  the  ancient  principles  of 
either  of  the  great  political  parties. 

The  fact  is — and  the  old  men  may  as  well  accept  it  for  the  young 
men  know  it — that  the  political  party  of  yesterday  is  not  the  party 
today.  [Applause.]  We  are  asking  for  a  leader  whose  promise  and 
performance  will  appeal  to  the  rising  generation  of  American  men  who 
are  now  changing  the  political  alignment  of  American  citizenship.  The 
destiny  of  the  country  is  in  the  hands  of  the  young  men  of  the  land, 
who  have  come  upon  the  stage  of  action  since  the  great  problems  of 
today  have  beckoned  for  solution  to  the  men  of  clean  minds  and  strong 
hearts  who  have  a  higher  regard  for  the  welfare  and  prosperity  of  their 
children  than  they  have  for  the  political  dogma  of  their  fathers. 
[Applause.] 


188  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

These  young  men  of  independent  thought  and  action  are  beir.g  told 
by  many  party  leaders  that  the  principles  laid  down  before  the  present 
day  problems  arose  to  challenge  the  judgment  of  statesmen  are  the 
unbending  and  absolute  test  to  measure  the  remedies  for  ailments  of* 
which  men  of  fifty  years  ago  never  dreamed,  and  which,  because  human 
like  ourselves,  they  could  not  foresee.  They  are  being  told  there  is 
no  such  thing  as  a  new  Republicanism  or  a  new  Democracy,  and  that 
the  two  great  parties  are  planted  in  the  soil  tilled  by  our  fathers  after 
deep  thought  and  strenuous  labor,  and  that  it  is  political  heresy  to 
preach  the  doctrine  of  a  new,  an  up-to-date,  a  twentieth  century  political 
1  creed.  [Applause.] 

But  every  sign  points  to  the  fact  that  the  young  men  of  the  coun- 
try are  persisting  in  that  heresy.  They  hold  more  lightly  every  year 
the  tie  which  binds  them  to  any  party  which  will  not  accommodate  itself 
to  new  conditions.  They  would  leave,  without  compunction,  any  political 
organization  when  once  they  are  convinced  that  its  leaders  are  so  hide- 
bound to  the  faith  of  the  fathers  that  they  are  blind  to  the  significance 
of  the  battle  now  being  waged  on  every  side  by  rising  men  with  new 
ideas,  and  deaf  to  the  present  demand  for  better  conditions  in  politics 
and  truer  performance  in  government.  They  would  be  faithful  to  the 
ideals  of  the  fathers,  but  they  do  not  shrink  from  that  elastic  interpre- 
tation of  party  principles  which  permits  the  solution  of  today's  prob- 
lems without  regard  for  yesterday's  conditions. 

A  veneration  for  ancient  landmarks  which  is  too  devout,  a  respect 
for  the  work  of  dead  men  which  is  too  holy,  will  blind  the  party  to  the 
crying  needs  of  a  living  present  and  an  imperishable  future.  History  is 
a  teacher,  not  a  master.  Yesterday  is  gone,  today  is  only  an  opportunity 
to  prepare  for  the  morrow,  which  is  crowding  on  its  heels.  That  states- 
man will  be  the  greatest  leader  of  his  time  of  whom  it  can  be  truest 
said  by  the  rising  generation  of  men.  "His  mind  is  in  the  past,  but 
his  hand  is  on  the  present,  and  his  eye  is  on  the  future."  [Applause.] 

The  young  men  in  both  the  great  parties,  whose  habits  of  thought 
have  not  been  stunted  by  blind  adherence  to  party  names,  or  powers  of 
speech  silenced  by  the  loud  noise-  of  party  shibboleths,  are  looking  for 
an  instrument  to  work  their  will.  They  will  eventually  but  certainly 
go  into  that  political  organization  which  measures  up  with  the  truest 
fidelity  to  the  gigantic  task  of  bringing  order  out  of  the  chaos  which 
has  resulted  in  the  business  world  from  disobedience  to  the  law  of 
the  land.  They  will  make  themselves  a  mighty  power  to  demand  just 
distribution  of  the  benefits  of  government  instead  of  the  favoritism  which 
has  resulted  from  law-made  prosperity  for  a  privileged  class  at  the 
expense  of  a  heavily  burdened  people.  They  will  tie  themselves  only  to 
that  party  which  gives  the  best  promise  to  bring  home  closer  to  the 
people  all  the  operations  of  government  by  a  stricter  regulation  of 
business  affairs,  and  a  closer  surveillance  of  political  activities.  [Ap. 
plause.] 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  189 

They  will  no  longer  tolerate  either  the  bi-partisan  political  machine, 
reigning  in  man}7  States,  or  its  natural  outgrowth,  the  partnership 
between  political  and  business  organizations,  now  powerful  in  Executive 
Chamber,  in  the  Senate,  and  on  the  Bench. 

In  their  search  for  a  leader  of  the  new  thought  in  the  old  Democracy, 
the  young  men  have  turned  to  Wilson.  [Applause.]  We  choose  him 
for  what  he  is  and  for  what  he  is  not.  We  follow  him  because  of  what 
he  stands  for  as  well  as  what  he  stands  against.  We  believe  in  him 
because  his  performance  has  squared  with  his  promise  to  the  last  inch 
of  the  specifications. 

He  voices  the  aspirations  of  the  young  men  who  seek  the  ideals  of 
the  Twentieth  Century  Democracy,  but  he  promises  fulfillment  of  their 
hopes  with  methods  tested  by  time.  He  is  a  conservative  on  the  move. 
He  stands  for  radical  measures  to  be  accomplished  in  a  conservative 
and  orderly  fashion.  He  appeals  to  independent  men,  but  attracts  most 
quickly  those  in  the  front  ranks  of  advanced  thought.  He  carries  no 
flaming  torch  of  discontent  and  makes  no  appeal  to  passion  or  prejudice. 
He  holds  aloft  the  steady  lamp  of  knowledge  and  makes  his  appeal  to 
the  reason  and  intellect  of  patriotic  men.  [Applause.] 

The  easy  line  of  least  resistance  has  never  been  his  pathway.  As  a 
public  servant,  he  has  accepted  the  people's  verdict,  always  treading  the 
straight  line  from  judgment  to  execution. 

When  he  denied  to  the  "board  of  guardians"  of  New  Jersey  the 
right  to  rule  the  State,  he  gave  his  bond  for  the  faithful  conservation  of 
the  people's  rights  when  called  to  higher  place.  WThen  he  refused,  as 
the  part)-  's  chosen  leader,  to  permit  a  self -named  boss  to  betray  the 
people's  will,  he  entered  security  that  under  him  no  act  of  party  dis- 
honor will  ever  soil  the  record  of  a  Democratic  administration.  When 
he  made  his  own  political  path  more  difficult  by  breaking  the  friend- 
ship of  years  to  prevent  the  grip  of  Wall  Street  from  tightening  upon 
hi  in,  he  measured  up  to  the  supreme  test  of  unselfish  devotion  to  the 
public  interest. 

Give  us  such  a  leader,  standing  upon  the  platform  of  progress  which' 
he  personifies,  and  all  the  power  of  Presidential  patronage,  plutocracy 
and  political  piracy  will  be  of  no  avail  to  defeat  your  cause.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  the  State  of 
.South  Carolina  was  called. 

Mr.  Ellison  D.   Smith,   of  South  Carolina,   rose. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  presents  to  the  Convention 
Senator  Smith,  of  South  Carolina. 

REMARKS  OF  ELLISON  D.  SMITH. 

MR.  ELLISON  D.  SMITH,  of  South  Carolina:  Fellow  Democrats,  just 
one  word  of  congratulation  to  you.  I  think  it  is  worth  while.  What 
WJB  went  through  last  night  was  a  sufficient  test  of  united  Democracy, 


190  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  or  THE 

What  we  have  passed  through  last  night  and  this  morning  is  a  test 
of  the  fact  that  the  Democratic  party  are  not  going  to  form  a  new 
party,  but  will  stay  in  the  old,  and  fight  it  out  in  their  own  party. 
They  are  not  going  off  on  a  tangent.  I  will  tell  you  what  let  us  do.  Let 
us  nominate  Woodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  the  State  of 
Virginia  was  called. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  presents  to  the  Convention 
Representative  Henry  D.  Flood,  of  Virginia. 

SPEECH  OF  HENRY  D.  FLOOD. 

MR.  HENRY  D.  FLOOD,  of  Virginia:  Mr.  Chairman,  gentlemen  of  the 
.  Convention,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  it  is  the  essential  strength  of  the  Demo- 
cratic party  that  there  should  be  different  opinions  among  its  members 
as  to  the  man  who  should  receive  its  honors,  and  I  rejoice  that  we  are 
embarrassed  today  by  the  number  and  brilliancy  of  the  names  which  have 
challenged  public  favor  for  this  nomination. 

It  is  the  glory  of  the  Democratic  party  that  "its  members  will  re- 
nounce all  personal  opinions  and  preferences  when  the  choice  has  been 
made  by  this  great  Democratic  Council  of  War;  will  move  on  the 
enemy  with  unbroken  ranks,  and  will  elect  the  nominees  of  this  Conven- 
tion. [Applause.] 

It  is  a  pleasant  task  to  voice  the  sentiment  of  your  State  for  one 
of  the  splendid  Democrats  whose  name  has  been  presented,  and  it  is  with 
great  pleasure  that  I,  in  the  name  of  the  people  of  Virginia,  upon  whose 
soil  his  ancestors  were  born,  second  the  nomination  of  Oscar  W.  Under- 
wood, of  Alabama,  for  the  office  of  President  of  the  United  States. 
[Applause.] 

In  doing  this  I  derive  a  pleasure  which  is  two-fold — combining  as  it 
does  the  discharge  of  a  public  duty  with  the  gratification  of  personal 
and  private  feelings  which  lie  very  deep  in  my  heart. 

On  the  one  hand  I  feel  that  I  render  a  service  to  the  Republic  in 
presenting  the  fittest  man  within  her  borders  for  this  great  office; 
while  on  the  other  I  propose  the  name  of  a  gentleman  for  whoso 
purity  of  private  life  and  lovable  personal  traits  I  feel  a  sincere  and  an 
affectionate  regard. 

Never  in  its  history  has  the  Democratic  party  been  more  entitled 
to  be  entrusted  with  power  than  it  is  at  this  time ;  never  has  it  been 
more  deserving  of  the  confidence  of  the  people  of  the  country;  and 
there  are  in  every  section  of  this  great  nation  thousands  of  independent, 
patriotic  Americans  ready  to  enlist  under  its  banner  whose  aid  will  carry 
our  ticket  to  victory  in  November.  [Applause.] 

In  this  campaign  we  can  appeal  to  the  people  upon  a  record  of 
achievement  unrivaled  in  the  political  history  of  the  country. 

After  being  out  of  power  in  every  branch  of  the  Government  for 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION-  191 

over  fourteen  years,  a  Democratic  House  convened  in  April,  1911;  it  was 
organized  by  the  Ways  and  Means  Committee  with  Underwood  as  Chair- 
man, with  a  rapidity  and  smoothness  that  commended  the  admiration  and 
respect  of  all,  and  with  Underwood  as  leader  it  proceeded  without  delay 
to  put  into  effect,  as  far  as  the  House  could  do  so,  the  declarations  of 
the  Democratic  platform  of  1908. 

From  the  ' '  immediate  revisions  of  the  tariff  by  the  reduction  of 
import  duties ' '  down  to  a  home-rule  bill  for  Alaska,  every  promise  has 
been  faithfully  fulfilled.  [Applause.]  Bills  providing  for  just  tariff 
reductions  and  fairly  distributing  the  burdens  of  taxation;  a  resolu- 
tion giving  Statehood  to  New  Mexico  and  Arizona;  a  Constitutional 
Amendment  providing  for  the  election  of  United  States  Senators  by 
direct  vote  of  the  people;  a  measure  providing  for  the  publication  of 
campaign  (-xj-enditure's  before  as  well  &lt;r&lt;s  after  the  election;  one  providing 
for  a  just  and  humanitarian  eight-hour  law;  one  making  appropriation 
for  public  highways,  and  many  other  progressive  measures  of  tremendous 
importance,  have  been  passed  by  the  House. 

Under  the  leadership  of  Virginia 's  great  Senator,  Thomas  S.  Martin, 
many  of  these  wise  progressive  measures  were  passed  by  the  Senate. 
[Applause.] 

From  the  standpoint  of  the  Democratic  party  the  two  sessions  of 
the  Sixty-Second  Congress  have  been  the  most  important  and  success- 
ful held  during  the  past  half  century.  They  would  have  been  success- 
ful from  the  standpoint  of  the  country  and  masses  of  the  people  if  the 
brave  and  patriotic  purposes  of  the  Democrats  had  not  been  crossed  and 
thwarted  by  the  vetoes  of  a  Republican  President. 

In  the  coming  contest  we  will  ask  to  be  judged  by  the  work  of  the 
House  of  Eepresentatives.  [Applause.]  This  work  was  done  under 
the  leadership  of  Oscar  Underwood.  We  will  present  the  result  of  this 
work  to  the  country  as  the  measure  of  the  capacity,  the  intelligence 
and  the  patriotism  of  the  Democratic  party;  the  most  important  part  of 
this  work  was  done  by  Oscar  Underwood.  All  of  the  speakers  who  have 
preceded  me  and  who  have  traced  the  history  of  Democratic  achieve- 
ments in  the  present  Congress,  were  paying,  though  it  might  have  been 
unconsciously,  a  tribute  to  the  leadership,  ability  and  capacity  of  Oscar 
Underwood.  There  can  be  no  praise  of  the  Democratic  party  in  the 
62nd  Congress  that  is  not  an  eulogy  of  Oscar  Underwood.  Blot  out  his 
work  in  that  Congress  and  we  would  have  little  to  appeal  to  the  people 
upon;  blot  out  his  work  and  even  the  dissensions  in  the  ranks  of  the 
enemy  would  not  assure  us  a  victory.  [Applause.] 

We  shall  doubtless  clearly  state  in  our  platform  the  reforms  needed 
for  the  betterment  of  the  country,  and  if  we  nominate  Underwood  it 
will  bo  a  guarantee  to  the  people  that  we  intend  to  carry  out  these 
reforms. 

New  phrases  have  grown  up  in  our  political  nomenclature.  We  hear 
of  "progressives"  and  "reactionaries,"  and  some  assume  authority  to 


192  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

label  others  as  the  one  or  the  other  without  reference  to  their  public  acts. 

The  wise  leader,  however,  is  the  conservative  progressive.  Such  men 
framed  the  Democratic  platform  in  1908  and  nominated  William  Jen- 
nings Bryan  for  President.  Six  million  four  hundred  thousand  voters 
subscribed  to  the  doctrines  of  that  platform  that  year;  many  millions 
more  believe  in  them  today  and  will  support  them  at  the  polls  in 
November.  [Applause.] 

Such  a  Democrat  is  Oscar  Underwood.  He  has  worked  to  weave  into 
the  web  and  woof  of  our  laws  every  important  declaration  of  that  plat- 
form; there  has  been  no  reform  needed  in  this  country  since  he  has  been 
in  pubjic  life  of  which  he  has  not  been  one  of  the  foremost  and  bravest 
champions;  there  will  not  be  an  issue  in  the  coming  campaign  with 
which  he  is  not  strikingly  identified. 

It  is  said  he  is  a  Southern  man — and  so  are  Speaker  Clark  and  Gov- 
ernor Wilson — and  whether  one  of  these  two  or  Underwood  be  nominated 
by  this  Convention,  he  will  win  and  his  success  will  not  be  a  mere  party 
victory,  but  will  be  a  great  National  triumph  that  will  mean  a  regenera- 
tion of  this  land,  which  will  crush  out  the  last  embers  of  sectional  strife 
and  be  hailed  as  the  dawn  of  the  day  of  perpetual  brotherhood. 

It  has  been  said  that  he  is  a  partisan  in  his  political  ideas  and 
methods.  If  by  this  is  meant  that  he  sincerely  and  honestly  believes  in 
the  purposes  and  principles  of  the  Democratic  party,  and  has  sought 
by  all  honorable  means  to  promote  the  public  good  by  placing  its  men 
and  measures  in  control  of  the  Government ;  if  by  it  is  meant  that  he 
possesses  an  unstinted  loyalty  to  friendship,  then  the  accusation  is  true 
and  the  term  becomes  a  just  tribute  to  a  true  and  honest  man.  It  has 
been  the  partisan  in  all  ages  of  the  world,  and  in  every  field  of  human 
progress,  who  has  led  the  way;  wherever  conflicts  of  opinion  have  deter- 
mined the  thoughts  and  actions  of  mankind  there  the  well-equipped 
partisan  has  been  the  guiding  power  and  controlling  force  for  good. 
[Applause.] 

He  is  a  born  leader  of  men  and  a  statesman  in  the  highest  and 
noblest  acceptation  of  the  term.  His  is  a  leadership  which  unites  men 
to  him,  not  by  the  hope  of  reward  nor  the  fear  of  disfavor,  but  by  the 
purity  of  his  life,  the  loyalty  of  his  heart,  the  magnetism  of  his  person- 
ality, and  the  power  of  his  intellect.  He  is  self-poised  and  courageous, 
honest  and  able,  painstaking  and  diligent.  With  him  as  a  leader  we  shall 
have  no  defensive  campaign,  no  apologies  or  explanations  to  make.  His 
integrity  and  common  sense,  his  courage  and  great  experience  are  the 
qualities  offered  his  country.  [Applause.] 

Nominate  Oscar  W.  Underwood,  and  let  the  country  know  that  a 
brave  party  is  led  by  a  brave  man,  whose  courage  will  never  falter,  be 
the  danger  or  emergency  what  it  may;  and  on  the  5th  of  November  we 
will  sweep  every  Democratic  State;  carry  every  doubtful  State,  and 
place  Democrats  in  control  of  every  branch  of  this  Government. 
[Applause,] 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  193 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  .of  the  roll,  and  the  State  of  Wis- 
consin was  called. 

Mr.  John  Walsh,  of  Wisconsin,  rose. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  presents  Mr.  John  Walsh,  of 
Wisconsin. 

SPEECH   OF   JOHN   WALSH. 

MR.  JOHN  WALSH,  of  Wisconsin:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  I  am  honored  to  be  authorized  by  the  delegation  from 
Wisconsin  to  ask  your  indulgence  for  a  few  moments  while  I  voice 
the  will  of  the  Democracy  of  my  State  as  it  was  expressed  by  the 
people  in  as  fair  a .  State-wide  direct  presidential  primary  as  was  ever 
held  anywhere.  The  expression  of  a  presidential  preference  and  the 
election  of  delegates  to  this  Convention  were  the  only  issues  presented. 
This  primary  was  conducted  with  all  the  supervision  and  formality  of  a 
general  election.  It  revealed  emphatically  that  Wisconsin  wants  Wood- 
row  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

There  is  no  better  State  in  the  Union  than  ours.  Seed  time  and 
harvest  ;jre  ns  sure  in  Wisconsin  as  in  any  State  in  the  Union.  It  is 
wonderfully  blest  with  good  health  and  moderate  wealth.  There  is  no 
better  or  more  conservative  citizenship  in  any  State;  none  has  a  smaller 
percentage  of  illiteracy,  and  nowhere  is  there  a  more  general  desire  on 
the  part  of  the  people  to  further  education  and  enlightenment. 

In  Wisconsin  the  people  are  earnestly  studying  the  problems  of  human 
welfare.  They  are  striving  for  legislation  that  will  produce  the  best 
economic  and  social  conditions.  They  are  enacting  progressive  laws  only 
after  the  most  careful  scrutiny  of  the  delicate  machinery  of  industry. 
The  cosmopolitan  citizenship  of  Wisconsin  is  too  sturdy  and  too  sane  to 
be  swayed  by  any  revolutionary  influence.  They  are  a  fearless  and 
determined  people  and  are  still  maintaining  the  spirit  of  the  men  who 
immortalized  the  ' '  Iron  Brigade. ' '  Ask  the  brave  and  valiant  soldiers 
of  the  Southland,  who  well  matched  their  valor  with  that  of  the  Sixth 
Wisconsin  Regiment  in  every  sanguinary  battle  fought  by  the  Army  of 
the  Potomac,  and  they  .will  verify  what  I  say  as  to  this  indomitable 
courage.  As  a  Wisconsin  man,  born  and  bred,  I  am  proud  of  its  people 
and  its  material  progress,  and  I  believe  that  its  legislation  in  recent 
years  is  doing  a  wonderful  work  in  promoting  human  happiness,  «.MI- 
lightenment  and  prosperity.  I  mention  these  things  to  call  your  atten- 
tion to  the  character,  aspirations  and  ideals  of  the  men  of  this  "land  of 
the  pioneers,"  who  ask  for  the  nomination  of  Woodrow  Wilson. 
[Applause.] 

We  are  in  the  midst  of  great  struggles  in  this  country.  E\en 
mightier  struggles  must  come  if  the  readjustment  of  economic  condi- 
tions and  laws  are  to  be  made  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  people.  The 
problem  before  this  country  is  not  the  introduction  of  Democratic  ideals 


194  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

by  violence,  but  to  preserve  and  entrench  those  that  came  to  us  from  the 
fathers  by  wise  and  courageous  adaptation  to  new  conditions — by  the 
enactment  of  legislation  so  constructed  as  to  lead  to  progress  and  at 
the  same  time  to  preserve  in  the  fullest  measure  all  human  achievement. 
You  may  offer  to  discuss  the  tariff,  trusts,  currency  and  economy  in 
government,  and  all  that,  but  the  people  at  the  present  time  are  in- 
terested politically  above  everything  else  in  the  movement  for  genuinely 
popular  Government,  and  for  the  recognition  of  the  absolute  sovereignty 
of  the  people.  They  have  awakened  to  the  fact  that  the  cure  for  the 
ills  of  our  body  politic — its  corruption,  its  injustice  and  favoritism — is 
in  the  establishment  of  true  representative  Government.  [Applause.] 
Wisconsin,  to  her  honor  and  glory,  has  been  in  the  vanguard  of  this 
movement  for  the  uplift  of  social,  political  and  economic  conditions.  The 
head  springs  of  the  mighty  stream  which  may  be  regarded  as  symboliz- 
ing the  regenerated  spirit  of  Democracy,  come  from  the  great  Stales 
of  the  Northwest.  The  people  of  these  States  are  Democratic  in  the 
broadest  sense  of  the  word.  Today  they  look  longingly  to  the  Democratic 
party  for  such  leadership  as  commands  confidence  and  justly  inspires 
hope.  No  one  realizes  the  force  of  this  great  swelling  current  of  per 
Distent,  popular  demand  more  keenly  than  the  young,  militant  and  pro- 
gressive Democracy  of  our  great  State.  They  know  to  what  extent  the 
conscience  of  the  nation  is  aroused  upon  this  great  question  of  popular 
Government,  and  so  knowing,  they  demand  that  this  Convention  nominate 
as  its  candidate  a  leader  who  best  represents  their  ideals  and  typifies  their 
aspirations.  [Applause.] 

This  is  the  time  and  the  place  to  reckon  with  the  past  and  the  future. 
We  must  be  guided  by  the  history  of  the  past — its  mistakes  and  suc- 
cesses— as  well  as  by  the  present  state  of  the  public  mind  and  the 
future  welfare  of  the  nation.  We  may  adopt  platforms  containing 
sincere  promises  or  high-sounding  platitudes,  but  unless  we  turn  to  a 
leadership  in  whom  the  people  trust  for  the  fulfillment  of  these  promises, 
we  labor  in  vain.  It  is  the  fulfillment  of  promises  rather  than  the 
making  of  promises  that  the  people  demand.  Unless  we  have  a  program 
and  a  leadership  in  harmony  with  the  tendency  of  the  times,  the  Demo- 
cratic party  shall  "stand  by  the  roadside  and  see  the  procession  go 
by." 

Today,  Governor  Wilson  typifies  more  than  any  other  man  in  public 
life  the  movement  for  better  laws,  for  more  equal  distribution  of  wealth 
and  the  protection  of  the  weak  against  the  strong  in  the  struggle  for 
existence.  He  has  studied  and  thoroughly  mastered  the  problems  of 
human  welfare  and  understands  the  needs  and  conditions  of  every  sta- 
tion in  life.  He  is  above  all  a  Democrat  by  instinct  and  temperament. 
He  first  heard  and  heeded  the  insistent  call  and  felt  the  pressure  of 
Democracy  upon  the  great  universities  of  this  country  to  adapt  them- 
selves to  thu  requirements  of  all  the  people.  He  is  not  a  professor  of 
the  old  school;  neither  is  he  a  politician  of  the  old  school.  He  has 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  195 

been  tried  in  the  laboratory  of  public  life  and  has  proven  himself  to  be 
a  sane  and  progressive  statesman.  He  has  been  trained  in  law,  politics, 
history  and  in  the  science  of  government  and  its  application  to  every 
walk  in  life.  He  is  endowed  with  a  creative  imagination  and  a  magnetic 
personality,  and  if  you  nominate  him  he  will  make  a  leader  whom  the 
nation  will  triumphantly  follow  into  the  great  civic  and  economic  con- 
flict. The  times  call  for  such  leadership.  We  demand  decency  in  seeking 
and  cleanliness  in  holding  public  station.  His  candidacy  insures  them. 
His  executive  talents  no  less  than  his  intellectual  strength  are  recognized 
far  beyond  the  frontiers  of  his  own  party  and  into  the  enemy's  country. 
His  candidacy  appeals  to  the  independent  in  politics;  to  the  democracy 
of  all  parties.  It  appeals  particularly  to  the  young  men  of  the  nation, 
for  whom  I  venture  to  speak.  They  see  in  him  a  national  leader  at  once 
sane,  learned,  patriotic,  progressive  and  capable;  a  leadership  that  bids 
fair  to  bring  about  the  realization  of  the  ideal  Republic.  The  Demo- 
cratic party  must  enlist  the  thought  and  vigor  of  the  young  manhood 
of  this  nation  if  it  hopes  to  fulfill  the  glorious  purpose  of  its  founders. 
We  ask  you  to  heed  the  advice  and  take  the  warning  of  this  great  State 
of  the  Northwest.  Wre  ask  you  to  take  Wisconsin  out  of  the  Republican 
column,  and  you  can  do  it  by  nominating  Woodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.] 
This  is  no  mere  claim  or  prediction,  nor  is  it  the  expression  of  a  wish 
that  is  father  to  the  thought,  but  it  is  the  unqualified  admission  of 
thousands  of  fair  minded  Republicans  in  Wisconsin  that  they  cannot 
possibly  hold  the  State  for  the  Republican  nominee  against  Woodrow 
Wilson.  We  promise  you,  and  this  promise  is  borne  out  by  history,  that, 
as  Wisconsin  goes,  so  goes  the  nation.  We  have  suffered  defeat  so  long 
and  have  been  so  sorely  chastened  that  we  would  make  no  extravagant 
promises.  We  are  extremely  confident — aye,  certain — that  we  can  win 
with  Woodrow  Wilson.  With  the  might  of  right  urging  him  on  to 
combat  he  will  bring  victory  to  our  party.  Woodrow  Wilson  is  a  son 
of  the  old  South,  a  progressive  in  the  conservative  East,  and  with  a 
record  of  achievements  and  a  personality  that  appeals  to  the  great 
West  and  Northwest,  all  true  Democrats  can  and  will  rally  to  his 
standard. 

His  candidacy  will  stop  all  talk  of  a  third  party.  In  this  cam- 
paign will  be  no  North,  no  South,  no  East  and  no  West,  but  a  common 
brotherhood  calling  upon  the  patriotism  of  this  nation  to  restore  the 
rule  of  the  people.  Wisconsin  joins  hands  with  her  widely  separated 
sister  States,  Texas  and  New  Jersey,  in  asking  for  the  nomination  of 
Woodrow  Wilson.  For  these  reasons  I  obey  the  direct  command  of  the 
Democracy  of  Wisconsin  in  seconding  the  nomination  of  the  fearless 
statesman,  the  staunch  Democrat,  the  brilliant  scholar,  the  peerless  pro- 
gressive, Woodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll,  and  called  the  District    • 
of  Columbia. 

Mr.   Lafe  Pence   rose. 


196  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Chair  presents  to  the  convention 
Mr.  Lafe  Pence,  of  the  District  of  Columbia. 

SPEECH  OF  LAFE  PENCE. 

MR.  LAFE  PENCE,  of  the  District  of  Columbia:  Mr.  Chairman  and 
gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  a  little  while  ago  you  gave  the  courtesy  of 
a  quiet  hearing  to  Senator  Gore,  while  he  closed  the  debate  on  behalf 
of  his  candidate.  I  bespeak  from  you  the  same  courtesy  while  for  a 
briefer  time  I  perform  the  same  service  for  another  candidate. 

All  will  concede  that  Mr.  Clark  has  made  the  most  remarkable  race 
in  this  candidacy.  I  desire  now  at  the  last  moment  to  remind  you  that 
one  unkind  word  has  ever  fallen  from  his  lips  concerning  any  com 
petitor,  and  that  is  the  secret  of  his  power  in  this  Convention.  [Ap- 
plause.] It  is  because  the  Democracy  have  come  to  look  upon  him  as 
the  happy  harmonizer  of  our  party  that  they  have  sent  his  delegates  here 
from  twenty-two  States.  If  that  were  not  true  there  would  not  be 
such  a  delegation  here  in  his  behalf. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  will  not  occupy  even  all  the  time  accorded  me  under 
the  rules.  On  behalf  of  the  District  of  Columbia  I  second  the  nomina- 
tion of  Champ  Clark,  of  Missouri.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  concluded  the  calling  of  the  roll  of  States  for  nomin- 
ating speeches. 

FIRST   BALLOT   FOB   CANDIDATE   FOR    PRESIDENT. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Secretary  will  now  call  the  roll 
of  States,  and  as  each  one  is  called  its  vote  for  President  will  be 
announced  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Delegation. 

The  Secretary  called  the  roll,  and  the  result  was  announced,  Clark 
440%,  Wilson  324,  Harmon  148,  Underwood  117%,  Marshall  31,  Baldwin 
22,  Sulzer  2,  Bryan  1,  not  voting  2,  as  follows:

CONVENTION  HALL, 
FIFTH  MARYLAND  REGIMENT  ARMORY, 

BALTIMORE,  June  28,  1912. 
The  Convention  met  at  4:00  o'clock  p.  m. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Eev.  Henry  M.  Wharton,  D.D.,  Pastor 
of  Brantly  Baptist  Church,  Baltimore,  will  offer  prayer. 

PRAYER   OF  REV.  HENRY   M.   WHARTON,   D.D. 

REV.  HENUY  M.  WHARTON,  D.D.,  Pastor  of  Brantly  Baptist  Church, 
Baltimore,  offered  the  following  prayer: 

Almighty  God,  our  Heavenly  Father,  we  stand  in  Thy  presence,  a 
great  company  of  Americans  who  love  their  country  and  who  honor 
God.  We  thank  Thee  for  Thy  guiding  hand  in  all  the  past.  And  now 
we  have  reached  an  hour  in  this  Convention  when  above  all  others  Thy 
wisdom  is  needed. 

It  seems  that  the  affairs  of  our  Government  are  about  to  pass  into 
ne\v  hands.  May  the  great  body  that  accepts  this  tremendous  respon- 
sibility receive  it  with  becoming  humility  and  sincerity,  and  discharge 
its  trust  with  conscientious  patriotism.  Our  Father,  we  pray  that  in 
''  \\  isc«ction  of  one  who  is  to  be  the  President  of  this  great  people 
Wi"wilt  give  us  a  man  who  fears  God,  who  accepts  His  word  as  a 
A^  to  his  path  and  a  lamp  to  his  feet;  one  whose  loving  heart  turns 

T)i:mpathy   to   the   great   toiling   millions   of   this    country;    one   who 
...us  how  to  feel  for  the  man  who,  by  the  sweat  of  his  brow,  makes 
his  daily  living;  and  God  speed  the  day  when  we  shall  have  such  relief 
that  a  man  shall  sit  down  in  company  with  his  family  and  feel  that  he 
is  not  impoverished  by  investing  his  week 's  earnings  in  a  single  meal. 

Oh,  God,  we  pray  for  a  man  to  guide  our  Ship  of  State  out  from 
among  the  icebergs  of  selfishness,  of  greed  and  of  lawlessness,  into  the 
high  seas  of  a  glorious  prosperity. 

God  Almighty,  grant  that  these  men  here  today  in  the  discharge  of 
their  duty  may  be  thinking  of  the  children,  of  the  women,  of  the  home 
people,  of  the  real  bone  and  sinew  of  this  great  land.  Guide,  we  pray 
Thee,  the  officers  of  this  Convention.  Direct  the  conscience  of  every 
man,  and  so  by  Thy  great  wisdom  wilt  Thou  bring  these  deliberations 
to  a  glorious  issue,  and  may  the  clouds  which  have  hung  so  low  over  our 
beloved  land  be  driven  away,  and  the  muttering  thunders  of  discontent 
be  heard  no  more  forever.  Guide  us,  we  pray  Thee,  until  our  work  on

'i  ^SIDING  OFFICER:  There  having  been  no  choice,  the  Secretary 

will  proceed  to  call  the  roll  for  the  third  ballot. 

THIRD  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

When  the  State  of  Ohio  was  called  Mr.  James  E.  Campbell  an- 
nounced the  vote  of  Ohio,  Clark  1,  Bryan  2,  Wilson  11,  Harmon  33,  1 
not  voting. 


202  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  W.  W.  DURBIN,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  challenge  the  vote  of 
Ohio. 

MR.  CAMPBELL,  of  Ohio:  One  delegate  in  the  Ohio  delegation  has  not 
voted.  Let  the  Secretary  call  his  name,  and  let  him  vote.  His  name -is 
Rinehart. 

MR.  DURBIN,  of  Ohio :  I  challenge  the  correctness  of  the  vote,  ind  ask 
a  roll-call  of  the  delegation. 

MR.  RINEHART,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  insist  that  you  poll  the  dele- 
gation. I  have  a  right  to  be  recorded. 

MR.  CAMPBELL,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  but  fair  to  state  that 
one  man  on  the  Ohio  delegation  had  not  voted  when  the  State  was  called, 
although  the  Secretary  of  the  delegation  had  been  standing  by  that  man 
for  twenty  minutes,  and  endeavoring  to  ascertain  how  he  wished  to 
vote.  I  reported  the  vote  as  it  was  when  the  State  was  called. 

MR.  RINEHART,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  deny  the  allegation. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:   Is  that  the  only  vote  in  question? 

MR.  CAMPBELL,  of  Ohio:  We  want  him  polled,  but  we  do  not  want 
the  entire  delegation  polled. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  We  cannot  select  out  one  man  from  a  dele- 
gation. The  entire  delegation  must  be  polled. 

MR.  CAMPBELL,  of  Ohio:  We  want  this  gentleman's  vote  polled,  but 
he  has  not  told  us  how  he  wants  to  vote.  Let  him  tell  the  Convention. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  Chair  rules  that  the  entire  Ohio  dele- 
gation must  be  polled.  One  man  cannot  be  selected  out  of  the  delegation

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  No  one  having  received  two-thirds, 
the  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  the  fifth  ballot. 

FIFTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

When  the  State  of  Kansas  was  called  the  vote  was  announced.  Clark 
20. 

MR.  J.  W.  ORR,  of  Kansas:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  challenge  the  vote  of 
Kansas,  and  we  ask  for  a  roll-call. 

MR.  B.  J.  SHERIDAN,  of  Kansas:  As  a  member  of  the  Kansas  dele- 
gation I  would  like  to  read  the  instructions  that  our  State  convention 
gave  to  the  delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Secretary  will  poll  the  Kansas 
delegation. 

.MR.  SHERIDAN,  of  Kansas:  No,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  read  the 
instructions  first.  The  instructions  given  in  the  Hutchinson  Convention 
of  Kansas  on  the  14th  of  March,  1912,  were  as  follows: 

"Be  it  further  resolved,  That  we  hereby  instruct  the  twenty  delegates 
of  Kansas,  elected  today  to  the  Baltimore  Convention,  to  vote  for  him 
[Clark]  as  a  unit  until  two-thirds  of  the  delegation  believe  his  nomina- 
tion to  be  impossible." 

Mr.  Chairman,  the  delegation  has  been  polled,  and  the  vote  stands  9 
for  Clark,  11  for  Wilson.  Under  the  instructions  of  the  State  Convention 
I  therefore  give  the  vote  as  20  for  Clark. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Does  the  gentleman  dispute  the  count 
as  announced? 

MR.  ORR,  of  Kansas:  Yes,  I  do,  and  I  ask  that  this  delegation  be 
polled. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  Does  the  gentleman  desire  the  resolu- 
tion read  from  the  platform? 

MR.  SHERIDAN,  of  Kansas:     Yes. 


208  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  official  copy  of  the  resolution  will 
be  read  by  the  Secretary. 

The  Secretary  read  as  follows: 

"Be  it  further  resolved,  That  we  hereby  instruct  the  20  delegated 

from  Kansas,  elected  today  to  the  Baltimore  Convention,.,  to  vote  for  him 

[Clark]  as  a  unit  until  two-thirds  of  the  delegation  believe  his  nomina- 

I    tion  to  be  impossible ;  and  the  delegates  elected  by  this  State  Convention 

•    are    further   instructed    that    on    all    other    matters    coming    before    the 

Democratic  Convention  of  1912  they  shall  vote  as  a  unit  as  a  majority 

of  the  said  delegates  may  direct. 

"And  ~be  it   further  resolved.  That   if  it   becomes  evident   that   Mr. 

. 

Clark  cannot  be  nominated,  then  our  2'0  delegates  shall  vote  for  Wood- 
row  Wilson,  as  long  as,  in  the  judgment  of  two-thirds  of  the  delegates 
f roin  Kansas,  he  has  a  chance  for  the  nomination. ' ' 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman,  if  the 
Chair  has  made  a  ruling,  I  ask  that  it  be  again  stated. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  There  has  been  no  ruling  as  yet.  The 
Chair  rules  that  as  long  as  two-thirds  of  the  delegates  from  Kansas  do 
not  vote  that  Clark  has  no  chance  for  the  nomination,  the  vote  of  Kansas 
in  its  entirety  of  20  must  be  cast  for  him,  as  directed  by  the  State  Con- 
vention. [Applause.]  If  the  gentleman  from  Kansas  demands  a  poll  of 
the  delegation  to  ascertain  whether  or  not  two-thirds  of  them  are  of  the 
opinion  that  Clark  cannot  win,  the  Chair  will  order  it.  Do  you  desire 
a  poll  of  your  State  delegation? 

MR.  ORR,  of  Kansas:     Yes.     Call  the  roll  of  the  Kansas  delegation. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  make 
the  point  of  order  that  under  the  resolution  of  instruction  of  the  Kansas 
Convention  the  question  whether  the  delegation  shall  go  to  Clark  or 
Wilson  is  entirely  for  the  delegation  itself  to  determine,  and  whatever 
poll  shall  be  made  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether  two-thirds 
believe  that  Mr.  Clark  still  has  a  chance  for  the  nomination  must  be 
made  by  the  delegation  itself,  and  not  by  this  Convention. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  That  is  what  the  Chair  is  trying  to 
ascertain. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania :  I  understood  that  the  Chair  had  in- 
structed the  Secretary  of  the  Convention  to  call  the  roll  of  the  delega- 
tion. My  point  is  that  the  roil  must  be  called  by  the  delegation  itself, 
and  the  result  announced  to  the  Convention.  In  other  words,  they  must 
settle  it  within  their  own  delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  In  the  Kansas  delegation  the  unit 
rule  prevails,  and  the  vote  should  be  cast  for  Clark  until  two-thirds  of 
the  delegates  believe  he  cannot  win.  The  State  Convention  left  that 
question  with  the  delegation,  but  the  National  Convention  has  a  right 
to  inquire  whether  or  not  two-thirds  are  of  that  opinion. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  But  not  by  calling  tin  ;ndividnal  roll 
of  the  delegation. 


DEMOCRATIC  XATIONAL  CONVENTION  209 

---_*yr-  . 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  same  question  was  raised  "at 
Denver,  the  Hon.  Henry  D.  Clayton,  who  was  the  Permanent  Chairman 
of  that  Convention,  held  just  as  I  have  decided  in  this  case.  The  right 
of  the  delegation  to  disregard  its  instructions  must  be  made  apparent 
to  the  Convention,  and  if  there  is  a  condition  imposed,  that  before  the 
vote  of  Kansas  shall  be  taken  from  the  choice  of  the  people  of  Kansas, 
two-thirds  of  the  delegation  shall  be  of  that  opinion,  this  Convention 
has  a  right  to  ascertain  whether  two-thirds  of  the  Kansas  delegation  are 
of  that  opinion.  The  point  of  order  is  overruled,  and  the  Secretary  will 
call  the  roll  of  the  Kansas  delegation. 

The  Secretary  polled  the  Kansas  delegation,  and  the  result  was 
announced — Clark  9,  Wilson  11,  as  follows:

NINTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

When  the  State  of  Connecticut  was  called,  the  vote  was  announced — 
Underwood  10,  Clark  3,  Wilson  1. 

MR.  MILES  F.  CONNELLEY,  of  Connecticut:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  the 
alternate  for  Hon.  William  Kennedy,  a  delegate  at  large,  the  Chairman 
of  the  Connecticut  delegation.  He  is  not  here,  and  he  was  not  here  when 
the  other  vote  was  counted,  but  had  started  out  previously.  He  has 
been  voted  for  Wilson,  making  2  for  Wilson.  In  his  absence  other 
members  of  the  delegation  are  trying  to  deprive  me  of  my  vote  as  an 
alternate,  and  I  will  not  stand  it. 

MR.  DANIEL  DUNN,  of  Connecticut:  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Kennedy  is 
in  the  rear  part  of  the  hall.  He  went  to  the  telephone.  We  have  an 
understanding  here  in  this  delegation  about  his  vote.  Mr.  Kennedy 
changed  his  vote  from  Wilson  two  or  three  ballots  ago,  the  same  as  I 
changed  from  Clark.  Now  this  gentleman  (Mr.  Connelley)  has  come 
in  here  and  we  have  let  him  have  a  seat,  but  Mr.  Kennedy  is  in  the 
hall,  and  every  one  of  this  delegation  has  an  understanding  in  regard  to 
the  vote.  Mr.  Connelley  has  no  authority  whatever  to  vote. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  will  state  to  the  gentleman 
that,  in  order  to  have  his  vote  counted,  Mr.  Kennedy  will  have  to  come 
and  sit  with  his  delegation  if  he  is  in  the  hall.  Let  him  come  forward 
and  cast  his  vote. 

MR.  DUNN,  of  Connecticut:     Mr.  Chairman,  please  pass  Connecticut.

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  No  candidate  having  received  the 
necessary  two-thirds,  the  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  the  tenth  ballot. 

TENTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

When  the  State  of  Oklahoma  was  called,  the  result  was  announced, 
Clark  10,  Wilson  10. 

MR.  BOONE  D.  HITE,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  as  a  delegate 
coming  from  Oklahoma  with  instructions  for  Mr.  Wilson  first  and  Mr. 
Clark  second,  and  my  understanding  of  those  instructions  being  that 
whenever  I  see  that  Mr.  Clark  is  the  choice  of  the  Convention  it  is  my 
duty  to  cast  my  vote  for  him,  I  demand  a  poll  of  the  State  of  Oklahoma, 
for  the  purpose  of  casting  my  vote  for  Champ  Clark. 

MR.  WILLIAM  H.  MURRAY,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  dele- 
gation from  Oklahoma  is  in  two  parts,  one  part  for  Wilson  and  one  part 
for  Clark.  They  have  polled  the  delegation  on  the  Wilson  side,  and  it 
stands  now  as  it  stood  at  home.  There  were  Clark  men  on  our  delega- 


220  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

tion,  and  we  have  no  objection  if  they  want  the  roll  called,  but  we  can 
straighten  it  out  for  ourselves,  and  we  do  insist  that  we  shall  not  join 
Tammany  in  making  the  nomination.  [Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  There  being  a  dispute  in  the  Oklahoma 
delegation,  the  delegation  will  be  passed,  and  the  next  State  will  be  called. 
Oklahoma  will  be  called  again  at  the  end  of  the  roll-call. 

The  roll-call  was  concluded. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  has  made  an  investigation 
of  the  Oklahoma  vote.  The  Oklahoma  delegation  consists  of  two  separate 
units,  of  ten  votes  each.  One  unit  is  for  Clark  and  one  for  Wilson. 
The  Chair  is  informed  that  of  the  ten  who  are  instructed  for  Wilson 
one  is  personally  for  Mr.  Clark.  The  two  parts  being  each  a  separate 
unit,  the  Chair  directs  the  vote  to  be  cast  10  for  Clark  and  10  for 
Wilson. 

MR.  MURRAY,  of  Oklahoma:     That  is  correct. 

The  result  was  announced:  Clark  556,  Wilson  350^,  Underwood 
H7l/2,  Marshall  31,  Harmon  31,  Kern  1,  Bryan  1,  as  follows:

Majority,  545. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  Xo  candidate  having  received  two- 
thirds  of  the  votes  cast,  no  nomination  is  made.  Mr.  Clark  having 
received  11  more  than  a  majority,  is  not  the  nominee  until  he  receives 
two-thirds. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise 
to  a  parliamentary  inquiry.  What  is  the  purpose  of  the  Chair  in  an- 
nouncing that  one  candidate  has  received  a  majority  of  the  votes? 


222  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Chair  states  the  fact  that  a 
majority  does  not  nominate,  but  that  under  the  rules  of  this  Convention 
it  takes  two-thirds. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  Hie 
eleventh  ballot. 

ELEVENTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

When  the  State  of  Arizona  was  called,  the  vote  was  announced 
Clark  6. 

MR.  E.  S.  IVES,  of  Arizona:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  challenge  the  vote  of 
Arizona.  . . 

MR.  E.  L.  SHAW,  of  Arizona:  Mr.  Chairman,  Arizona's  delegation 
was  elected  by  a  preferential  primary.  Mr.  Clark  carried  our  State  by 
a  proportion  of  between  10  and  11  to  1,  and  we  are  instructed  to  stay 
by  Mr.  Clark,  as  a  result  of  that  preferential  primary,  as  long  as  he  has 
a  chance  of  receiving  the  nomination.  There  is  also  a  second  choice,  but 
so  long  as  Mr.  Clark  is  in  the  ring,  our  six  votes  must  go  solid  for 
Champ  Clark. 

MR.  IVES,  of  Arizona :     I  ask  that  the  Arizona  delegation  be  polled. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  vote  of  Arizona  being  challenged, 
the  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of  that  delegation. 

The  Secretary  polled  the  delegation,  as  follows: 

AKIZONA.  Clark.  Wilson. 

P.  C.  Little 1 

F.  E.  Shine -. 1 

E.  S.  Ives 1 

E.  L.    Shaw 1 

Ed.    F.    Thompson 1 

Ed.   Sawyer    1 

5  1 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Under  the  rule  adopted  by  this  Con- 
vention, where  a  delegate  is  elected  by  a  primary,  if  he  sees  fit  to  go 
contrary  to  his  instructions,  he  has  that  right  and  is  responsible  to  his 
constituency,  and  is  entitled  to  cast  his  vote  in  any  way  he  chooses. 
Therefore  the  vote  will  be  recorded  by  the  Secretary  as  it  was  cast. 
[Applause.]  The  Secretary  will  proceed  with  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

When  the  State  of  Oregon  was  called,  the  vote  was  announced,  Wilson 
8,  Clark  2. 

MR.  THOS.  CARRICK  BURKE,  of  Oregon:  Mr.  Chairman,  under  the 
preferential  primary  law  of  Oregon  the  delegation  is  unconditionally 
pledged  to  vote  for  Wilson.  There  are  no  conditions  attached  what- 
ever. We  want  to  carry  out  our  instructions,  but  two  of  the  delegates 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  223 

have   seen   fit   to   disregard  their  instructions,  and   I  therefore  cast  the 
vote  of  Oregon.  8  for  Wilson.  2  for  Clark. 

MR.  FREDERICK  A*.  HOLMAN,  of  Oregon:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to 
say  here  that  that  statement  is  false.    Oregon  has  a  preferential  primary, 
and  we  each  took  an  oath  that  we  would  exercise  the  best  of  our  judg- 
ment and  ability  in  endeavoring  to  carry  out  our  instructions  as  expressed 
at  the  polls.     We  have  voted  here  today.     Mr.   Clark   has  received   a 
majority.     Mr.  Wilson  has  not  even  one-third,  and  I  as  a  member  of  the    ; 
Oregon    delegation,    with   due    regard    for   my   oath,   depending   on    our 
judgment  and  exercising  it  as  we  have  a  right   to   do,  believe  that  we    } 
now  have  the  right,  and  that  the  time  has  come  when  we  should  exercise    i 
our  judgment,  and  we  have  the  right  to  exercise  it  by  casting  a  vote    ! 
for  Champ  Clark.     [Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     Debate  is  not  in  order. 

MR.  WILL  B.  KING,  of  Oregon :     Mr.  Chairman,  as  one  of  the  Oregon 
delegation  I  want  to  challenge  this  vote,  and  ask  for  a  roll-call. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  vote  of  Oregon  being  challenged, 
the  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of  that  State. 

The  Secretary  polled  the  delegation,  as  follows:      p,    ,     w-,

Ever  gracious  and  AD  Wise  God,  our  Heavealy  Talker,  l¥ov  im 
Whose  Omnipotent  hand  are  the  rights  of  me«  and  the  destinies  of 
nations,  ire  bow  in  Thy  presence,  realizing  our  need  of  gndawce  and

230  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

THIETEENTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

MR.  HENRY  G.  MOLINA,  of  Porto  Eico  (when  Porto  Eico  was  called)  : 
Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  for  a  poll  of  the  Porto  Eico  delegation.  I  do  this 
for  the  purpose  of  calling  attention  to  the  fact  that  in  the  printed 
temporary  roll  the  list  of  the  accredited  delegates  from  Porto  Eico  is 
not  complete.  There  were  two  sets  of  delegates,  and  a  contest,  which 
was  settled  by  the  National  Committee  by  the  seating  of  both  dele- 
gations, giving  each  delegate  one-half  vote. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  names  printed  in  the  temporary 
roll  are  merely  preliminary,  and  the  Chair  understands  that  the  Na- 
tional Committee  seated  both  delegations,  so  that  the  delegation  is 
composed  of  twelve  men  instead  of  six,  each  of  the  twelve  having  one- 
half  a  vote. 

The  Chair  is  informed  that  one  of  the  delegates  was  absent,  and 
the  alternate  voted,  but  the  delegate  came  in  before  the  result  was 
announced.  It  is  agreed  that  the  Porto  Eico  delegation  votes  5i  for 
Wilson  and  J  vote  for  Clark. 

The  Secretary  having  resumed  and  concluded  the  calling  of  the  roll, 
the  result  was  announced:     Clark   554$,  Wilson   356,   Underwood 
Marshall  30,  Harmon  29,  Foss,  2,  Bryan  1,  as  follows:

the  calling  of  the  roll.  How  does  the  gentleman  votef 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska :  As  long  as  Mr.  Ryan 's  agent — as  long  as 
New  York's  90  votes  are  recorded  for  Mr.  Clark,  I  withhold  my  vote 
from  him  and  cast  it 

[At  this  point  there  was  a  demonstration.] 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  STONE,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman  and  fellow 
delegates,  I  pray  every  delegate  on  the  floor  and  every  lady  and  gentle- 
man in  the  gallery  to  hear  the  distinguished  delegate  from  Nebraska 
Let  us  have  order,  and  let  every  man  be  heard. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     How  much  time  does  the  gentleman  want? 

MR.  STONE,  of  Missouri :  I  do  not  want  any  time  myself.  I  want 
order,  and  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska 
(Mr.  Bryan)  be  allowed  to  speak.  T  ask  unanimous  consent  that  Mr. 
Bryan,  or  any  other  delegate  who  desires  to  be  heard,  may  be  heard. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     Does  the  gentleman  make  that  as  a  motion? 

MR.  STONE,  of  Missouri :     That  is  the  motion. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Senator  Stone  of  Missouri  moves  that  the 
gentleman  from  Nebraska  (Mr.  Bryan)  may  be  allowed  to  explain 
his  vote. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

MB.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  I  wish  to  explain  my  vote  only  because  my  advice  was  not 
followed  in  my  own  delegation.  I  advised  that  those  of  us  who  are 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVF;NTION  •?:&gt;&gt; 

instructed  for  Mr.  Clark  should  continue  to  vote  for  him  until  condi- 
tions arose  that  justified  us  in  doing  otherwise,  i  did  not  believe  that 
the  conditions  had  yet  arisen, .but  not  all  of  the  delegates  agreed  with 
me,  and  then  I  was  desirous  that  a  poll  should  not  be  required;  but  if 
we  are  to  have  a  division,  if  a  poll  is  demanded  and  each  man  must  give 
a  reason  for  the  vote  that  he  casts,  I  am  now  ready  to  cast  my  vote 
and  to  give  my  reasons  for  so  doing. 

I  have  asked  the  privilege  of  making  an  explanation  because  I  am 
not  alone  in  this  convention.  I  do  not  represent  a  one  man  opinion. 
Many  of  these  delegates  look  at  this  question  as  I  do,  and  when  I  speak 
for  myself  I  speak  for  some  others  in  this  hall,  and  I  am  sure  for  a  still 
larger  number  outside  of  this  hall.  [Applause.]  fl  recognize,  there 
fore,  the  responsibility  that  rests  upon  me  when  I  do  what  I  intend  to 
do,  and  give  the  explanation  that  I  am  now  prepared  to  give.  I  antici- 
pated that  this  necessity  would  arise  some  time  during  the  day,  but  I 
did  not  expect  it  to  arise  at  so  early  an  hour,  and  in  anticipation  T 
wrote  out  what  I  desire  to  submit.  It  will  take  me  only  a  moment  to 
read  it,  as  I  prefer  that  there  shall  be  no  mistake  in  the  reporting  anil 
transcribing  of  it. 

MR.  JOHN  N.  HUGHES,  of  Iowa:      Mr.  Chairman 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  gentleman  from  Nebraska  is  pro- 
ceeding to  explain  his  vote.  Nothing  else  is  in  order. 

MR.  HUGHES,  of  Iowa:     I  move  that  the  Secretary  read  the  paper 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     The  gentleman  is  not  in  order. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Nebraska  is  a  progressive  State.  Only 
twice  has  she  given  her  vote  to  a  Democratic  candidate  for  President, 
in  1896  and  in  1908,  and  on  both  occasions  her  vote  was  cast  for  a  pro- 
gressive ticket,  running  upon  a  progressive  platform.  Between  these 
two  elections,  in  the  election  of  1904,  she  gave  a  Eepublican  plurality  of 
85.000  against  a  Democratic  reactionary.  In  the  recent  primaries  the 
total  vote  cast  for  Clark  and  Wilson  was  over  34,000,  and  the  vote  casr 
for  Harmon  something  over  12,000,  showing  that  the  party  is  now  more 
than  three-fourths  progressive,  or  about  three-fourths  progressive.  The 
Republican  party  of  Nebraska  is  progressive  in  about  .the  same  propor- 
tion. The  situation  in  Nebraska  is  not  materially  different  from  the 
situation  throughout  the  country  west  of  the  Alleghenies.  In  the 
recent  Eepublican  primaries,  fully  two-thirds  of  the  Eepublican  vote- 
was  cast  for  candidates  representing  progressive  policies. 

In  this  convention  the  progressive  sentiment  is  overwhelming.  Every 
candidate  has  proclaimed  himself  a  progressive.  No  candidate  would 
have  any  considerable  following  in  this  convention  if  he  admitted  him- 
self out  of  harmony  with  progressive  ideas. 

By  ycur  resolution,  adopted  night  before  last,  you,  by  a  vote  of 
more  than  four  to  one,  pledged  the  country  that  you  would  nominate 
for  the  Presidency  no  man  who  represented  or  was  obligated  to  Morgan. 
Ryan,  Belmont,  or  any  other  member  of  the  privilege-seeking,  favor-

OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 


hunting  class.  This  pledge,  if  kept,  will  have  more  influence  on  the 
result  of  the  election  than  the  platform  or  the  name  of  the  candidate. 
How  can  that  pledge  be  made  effective?  There  is  but  one  way;  namely, 
to  nominate  a  candidate  who  is  under  no  obligation  to  those  whom 
these  influences  directly  or  indirectly  control.  The  vote  of  the  State  of 
New  York  in  this  convention,  as  cast  under  the  unit  rule,  does  not  rep- 
resent the  intelligence,  the  virtue,  the  Democracy  or  the  patriotism  of 
the  ninety  men  who  are  here.  It  represents  the  will  of  one  man — 
Charles  F.  Murphy — and  he  represents  the  influences  that  dominated 
the  Eepublican  convention  at  Chicago  and  are  trying  to  dominate  this 
convention.  [Applause.]  If  we  nominate  a  candidate  under  conditions 
that  enable  these  influences  to  say  to  our  candidate,  ' '  Eemember  now 
thy  creator,"  we  cannot  hope  to  appeal  to  the  confidence  of  the  pro- 
gressive Democrats  and  Eepublicans  of  the  nation.  Nebraska,  or  that 
portion  of  the  delegation  for  which  I  am  authorized  to  speak,  is  not 
willing  to  participate  in  the  nomination  of  any  man  who  is  willing  to 
violate  the  resolution  adopted  by  this  Convention,  and  to  accept  the 
high  honor  of  the  Presidential  nomination  at  the  hands  of  Mr.  Murphy. 
[Applause.] 

When  we  were  instructed  for  Mr.  Clark,  the  Democratic  voters  who 
instructed  us  did  so  with  the  distinct  understanding  tnat  Mr.  Clark 
stood  for  progressive  Democracy.  [Applause.]  Mr.  Clark's  representa- 
tives appealed  for  support  on  no  other  ground.  They  contended  that 
Mr.  Clark  was  more  progressive  than  Mr.  Wilson,  and  indignantly 
denied  that  there  was  any  co-operation  between  Mr.  Clark  and  the 
reactionary  element  of  the  party.  Upon  no  other  condition  could  Mr. 
Clark  have  received  a  plurality  of  the  Democratic  vote  of  Nebraska. 
The  thirteen  delegates  for  whom  I  speak  stand  ready  to  carry  out  the 
instructions  given  in  the  spirit  in  which  they  were  given,  and  upon  the 
conditions  under  which  they  were  given  [applause]  ;  but  some  of  these 
delegates — I  can  not  say  for  how  many  I  can  speak,  because  we  have 
not  had  a  chance  to  take  a  poll — will  not  participate  in  the  nomination 
of  any  man  whose  nomination  depends  upon  the  vote  of  the  New  York 
delegation.  [Applause.] 

Speaking  for  myself  and  for  any  of  the  delegation  who  may  decide 
to  join  me,  I  shall  withhold  my  vote  from  Mr.  Clark  as  long  as  New 
York's  vote  is  recorded  for  him.  [Applause.]  And  the  position  that  I 
take  in  regard  to  Mr.  Clark,  I  will  take  in  regard  to  any  other  candi- 
date whose  name  is  now  or  may  be  before  the  convention.  I  shall  not 
be  a  party  to  the  nomination  of.  any  man,  no  matter  who  he  may  be,  or 
from  what  section  of  the  country  he  comes,  who  will  not,  when  elected, 
be  absolutely  free  to  carry  out  the  anti-Morgan-Ryan-Belmont  resolu- 
tion and  make  his  administration  reflect  the  wishes  and  the  hopes  of 
those  who  believe  in  a  government  of  the  people,  by  the  people  and  for 
the  people.  [Applause.] 

If  we  nominate  a  candidate  who   is  under  no  obligation  to   these 


I     ' 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  235 


interests  which  speak  through  Mr.  Murphy,  I  shall  offer  a  resolution 
authorizing  and  directing  the  presidential  candidate  to  select  a  cam- 
paign committee  to  manage  the  campaign,  in  order  that  he  may  not  be 
compelled  to  suffer  the  humiliation  and  act  under  the  embarrassment 
that  1  have,  in  having  men  participate  in  the  management  of  his  cam- 
paign who  have  no  sympathy  with  the  party's  aims,  and  in  whose 
Democracy  the  general  public  has  no  confidence. 

Having  explained  the  position  taken  by  myself  and  those  in  the 
delegation  who  view  the  subject  from  the  same  standpoint,  I  will  now 
announce  my  vote — 

MR.  WILLIAM  A.  McC'ORKLE,  of  West  Virginia:     Mr.  Chairman — 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  gentleman  is  out  of  order.  Nothirtg 
is  in  order  except  the  explanation  of  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  I  am  perfectly  willing  to  yield,  if  £he 
Chair  please. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Governor  McCorkle  wishes  to  ask  a  ques- 
tion of  Mr.  Bryan. 

MK.  McCoRKLE,  of  West  Virginia:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  Mr. 
Bryan's  permission  to  ask  him  a  question.  There  was  so  much  confu- 
sion that  it  was  impossible  for  the  delegates  to  understand  clearly  Mr. 
Bryan 's  position.  I  therefore  want  to  ask  him — and  I  do  it,  sir,  in 
the  most  perfectly  courteous  manner  and  feeling — the  categorical  ques- 
tion whether  he  intends  to  be  understood  that  he  will  not  support  the 
nominee  of  this  Convention  if  he  is  voted  for  and  nominated  by  the 
present  vote  of  the  State  of  New  York  in  this  Convention? 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  I  shall  be  glad  to  answer  the  question  of 
the  gentleman  from  West  Virginia,  and  before  answering  it  I  shall  be 
glad  to  add  that  if  any  other  gentleman  in  this  Convention  has  any 
question  on  his  mind  that  he  would  like  to  get  rid  of,  I  will  remain 
here  and  give  him  a  chance  to  ask  it.  [Applause.]  This  is  a  Demo- 
cratic convention,  and  we  have  a  right  to  ask  questions  of  each  other, 
and  we  ought  to  be  frank  with  each  other. 

A  DELEGATE  :     Are  you  a  Democrat  ? 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska :  My  Democracy  has  been  certified  to  by 
six  and  a  half  million  Democrats;  hut  I  will  ask  the  Secretary  to  enter 
on  the  record  one  dissenting  vote  if  the  gentleman  will  give  me  his  name. 

Some  gentleman  asked  me  if  I  was  a  Democrat,  and  I  would  like  to 
have  his  name,  that  I  may  put  it  by  the  side  of  Ryan  and  Belmont,  who 
were  not  Democrats  when  I  was  a  candidate  for  the  Presidency.  [Ap- 
plause.] 

Now  let  me  answer  the  question  of  the  gentleman  from  West  Vir- 
ginia. Nothing  that  I  said  this  morning,  and  nothing  that  I  have  ever 
said  justifies  the  construction  that  the  gentleman  would  place  upon  my 
language.  I  distinguish  between  refusing  to  be  a  party  to  the  nomina- 
tion of  a  candidate  and  refusing  to  support  him  after  he  has  been  nomi- 
nated over  my  opposition,  just  as  the  law  distinguishes  between  the 


236  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

lawyer  who  defends  a  criminal  after  the  crime  has  been  committed,  and  . 
the  lawyer  who  conspires  with  a  man  to  commit  a  crime.      [Applause.] 
Is  there  any  other  question?     If  not,  I  shall  announce  my  vote. 

MR.  EARL  BREWER,  of  Mississippi :  Mr.  Bryan,  I  have  a  question. 
If  Mr.  Clark,  Mr.  Underwood,  Mr.  Marshall,  Mr.  Wilson,  Mr.  Harmon, 
Mr.  Kern,  or  Governor  Foss  is  nominated  by  this  convention  by  a  two- 
thirds  majority,  with  New  York  voting  for  the  man  who  is  nominated, 
will  you  support  the  Democratic  nominee? 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  I  deny  the  right  of  any  man  to  put  a 
hypothetical  question  to  me  unless 

MR.  W.  C.  DOWD,  of  North  Carolina:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a 
point  of  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  gentleman  will  state  his  point  of 
order. 

MR.  DOWD,  of  North  Carolina:  My  point  of  order  is  that  the  gen 
tleman  from  Nebraska  has  the  floor  to  explain  his  vote,  and  that  these 
questions  are  out  of  order. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:     I  have  given  my  permission. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  point  of  order  is  well  taken.  The 
Chair  sustains  the  point  of  order. 

MR.  EARL  BREWEE,  of  Mississippi :     Do  not  dodge. 

MR.  JOHN  B.  KNOX,  of  Alabama:  There  are  a  thousand  delegates 
here,  and  we  have  something  else  to  do  besides  listening  to  Mr.  Bryan 
make  his  fourth  or  fifth  speech. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Let  me  complete  the  sentence.  The  gen- 
tleman has  asked  a  question,  and  I  have  a  right  to  answer  it.  Let  me 
conclude  my  sentence. 

MR.  BREWER,  of  Mississippi:     Answer  yes  or  no,  and  then  explain. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  I  said  I  deny  his  right  to  ask  a  hypo- 
thetical question  unless  he  is  prepared  to  put  into  that  question  every 
essential  element  that  is  necessary  to  be' understood  before  it  can  be 
answered  intelligently.  That  I  understand  to  be  a  legal  proposition. 

MR.  JOHN  B.  KNOX,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  have  we  not  any- 
thing to  do  in  this  convention  except  to  listen  to  Mr.  Bryan's  speeches? 
The  unanimous  consent  of  this  convention  was  never  given,  and  the 
gentleman  is  speaking  by  an  arbitrary  ruling  of  the  Chair,  and  he  is 
speaking  out  of  order.  He  has  already  made  four  speeches.  I  makf 
the  point  of  order  that  he  has  already  spoken  over  30  minutes.  There 
is  no  delegate,  I  make  the  point  of  order,  who  has  the  right  to  abuse 
this  privilege.  Whenever  Mr.  Bryan  comes  to  the  platform  the  Chair 
secures  order  for  him,  and  time  for  him  to  speak,  and  he  will  not  recog- 
nize anybody  else.  That  is  the  worst  part  of  it. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  is  out  of  order  and 
will  take  his  seat.  The  gentleman  from  Nebraska,  Mr.  Bryan,  is  speak 
ing  by  the  consent  of  the  Convention,  given  upon  motion  of  Senator 
Stone,  while  Mr.  Sulzer,  of  New  York,  was  temporarily  in  the  Chair. 

MR.   BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:     I   have  no   expectation   that   :iny   nomi- 


* 


DEMOCRATIC  XATIOXAL  CONVENTION  237 

nation  in  this  convention  will  be  secured  in  any  way  or  under  any  condi- 
tion that  will  prevent  my  giving — 

MR.  KNOX,  of  Alabama:     A   point  of  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     The  gentleman  will  state  it. 

MR.  KNOX,  of  Alabama :  There  is  no  delegate  who  has  a  right 
to  abuse  his  privilege,  to  attack  a  candidate  before  this  convention,  ,and 
to  attack  a  sovereign  State. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska :  Having  denied  the  right  of  the  gentleman 
to  ask  the  question,  and  having  declared  that  he  has  taken  advantage 
of  a  Democratic  convention  to  ask  a  question  that  he  would  not  dare 
to  ask  in  any  court  of  justice.  I  will  now  answer  his  question.  I  expect 
to  support  the  nominee  of  this  convention.  [Applause.]  I  do  not  expect 
anyone  to  be  nominated  here  who  will  not  deserve  the  support  of  the 
Democratic  party.  I  do  not  expect  anyone  to  be  nominated  who  would 
permit  a  partnership  between  Morgan,  Ryan,  Belmont,  and  himself. 
[Applause.]  But  I  do  not  consider  myself  under  obligations  to  give  | 
bond  to  answer  the  question  categorically  until  the  conditions  arise 
when  I  can  know  what  I  am  answering. 

Now  I  am  prepared  to  announce  my  vote,  unless  again  interrupted. 
With  the  understanding  that  I  shall  stand  ready  to  withdraw  my  vote    j 
from  the  one  for  whom  I  am  going  to  cast  it  whenever  New  York  casts    , 
her  vote  for  him,  I  cast  my  vote  for  Nebraska's  second  choice,  Governor    - 
Wilson.     [Applause.] 

MR.  STONE,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  not  rise  to  enter  into 
any  kind  of  controversy  with  Mr.  Bryan  or  any  other  man.  Any  dele- 
gate here  has  a  right  to  speak  as  he  pleases  in  obedience  to  the  instruc- 
tions of  his  constituency.  The  responsibility  is  his,  not  mine. 

So  far  as  Speaker  Clark  is  concerned,  I  have  just  this  one  sentence 
to   utter.     I  proffer  his  plain   record   as  a   Democrat,   and  the   splendid     \ 
service  rendered  his  party  for  more  than  a   quarter   of  a  century,  and     ; 
no   part   of    it    more    conspicuous   than    that    during   the    campaigns    of 
William  J.  Bryan.      [Applause.] 

I  move  that  we  now  proceed  with  the  regular  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Secretary  will  proceed  with  the 
poll  of  the  Nebraska  delegation. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  poll  of  the  Nebraska  delegation,  and 
called  the  name  of  Felix  J.  McShane,  Jr. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  an  alternate  for 
Mr.  McShane  in  the  second  district. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :    There  are  no  alternates  reported  in  the    . 
printed  list,  except  from  the  State  at  large. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Then  we  demand  the  right  to  furnish  the 
names  of  the  alternates,  according  to  the  resolutions  of  our  State  com- 
mittee, which  authorized  each  delgate  to  appoint  his  own  alternate. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  will  send  up  the  reso- 
lution. 


238  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  The  alternate  is  here.  He  came  all  the 
way  from  Nebraska  with  oral  instructions,  and  has  been  with  us  all  the 
time,  and  I  do  not  understand  that  anyone  questions  Jiis  right. 

MR.  ARTHUR  PETER,  of  Maryland :  I  do,  because  I  heard  him  say  "a 
moment  ago  that  he  had  no  written  authority.  I  am  a  delegate  from 
Maryland,  and  have  voted  for  Mr.  Bryan  every  time  he  ran. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:    Objection  is  made. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  I  submit,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  if  New 
York  and  Virginia  can  send  these  men  here  to  this  Convention,  Nebraska 
has  a  right  to  determine  who  her  alternates  shall  be. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  resolution  adopted  in  Nebraska 
authorizes  each  delegate  to  select  his  own  alternate.  The  Chair  will  state 
to  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  [Mr.  Bryan]  that  if  he  will  send  up  the 
name  of  the  alternate  selected  by  the  delegate,  he  can  have  his  vote 
recorded. 

MR.  J.  H.  BEGLEY,  of  Nebraska:  I  am  the  alternate,  and  I  vote  for 
Wilson. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman's  vote  will  be  recorded, 
as  the  duly  authorized  alternate  for  Mr.  McShane,  who  votes  for  Wilson. 

The  poll  of  the  Nebraska  delegation  having  been  concluded,  the  result 
was  announced,  Wilson  4,  Clark  12,  as  follows:

MR.  E.  L.  WILLIAMS,  of  Oklahoma  (when  the  State  of  Oklahoma  wa* 
called) :    Mr.  Chairman,  I  demand  a  poll  of  the  Oklahoma  delegation. 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  239 

MR.  W.  H.  MURRAY,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  a  point  of  order. 
I  do  not  object  to  the  roll-call,  but  we  ought  first  to  call  the  Clark  roll 
and  count  the  result  and  then  call  the  Wilson  roll  and  count  that. 

MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Oklahoma:     That  is  right. 

THE  SECRETARY  :  There  are  seventeen  men  from  Oklahoma  designated 
as  delegates  for  the  State  at  large. 

MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Oklahoma:     And  three  alternates. 

THE  SECRETARY:     Three  alternates. 

MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Oklahoma:  Call  them  all,  because  the  three  men 
whose  names  appear  on  the  printed  list  as  alternates  have  been  made 
delegates. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  poll  the  Oklahoma  delegation. 

MR.  E.  J.  GIDDINGS,  of  Oklahoma  (when  his  name  was  called) :  Mr. 
Chairman — 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     For  what  purpose  does  the  gentleman 
rise? 

MR.  GIDDINGS,  of  Oklahoma:  Like  Mr.  Bryan,  of  Nebraska,  I  wish 
to  explain  my  reasons  for  changing  my  vote  from  Wilson  to  Clark. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  I  ask  that  the  gentleman  be  permitted 
to  explain  his  vote. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  Is  there  objection  to  the  gentleman 
from  Oklahoma  (Mr.  Giddings)  having  an  opportunity  to  explain  his 
vote? 

MR.  JOHN  W.  PECK,  of  Ohio:     I  object. 

MR.  GIDDINGS,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Bryan  was  per- 
mitted to  explain  his  vote.  I  appeal  to  this  Convention  to  let  me  explain 
my  vote,  for  my  people  at  home. 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:     Let  us  have  both  sides  here. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  is  forced  to  rule  that  the 
gentleman  is  not  permitted  to  explain  his  vote,  objection  having  been 
made.  The  Chair  is  compelled  to  rule  that  where  there  is  .objection  no 
delegate  is  entitled  to  explain  his  vote. 

Mu.  PECK,  of  Ohio:     I  withdraw  my  objection. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  objection  being  withdrawn,  and 
there  being  no  other  objection,  the  Chair  recognizes  the  gentleman  from 
Oklahoma  (Mr.  Giddings)  to  explain  his  vote. 

Mi:.  GIDDINGS,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  explain 
briefly  to  this  Convention  my  reason  for  my  action  in  changing  my  vote. 

From  1896  down  to  the  present  time  I  have  followed  unwaveringly 
the  standard  of  the  Niagaric  Nebraskan.  On  the  Temporary  Chairman- 
ship I  followed  him ;  but,  my  friends,  I  do  not  propose  to  sit  here  and 
hear  aspersions  cast  upon  any  good  Democrat  by  the  delegate  from 
Nebraska.  I  want  to  say  to  you,  without  conceit,  that  I  do  not  believe 
there  would  have  been  a  Wilson  delegate  in  this  Convention  from  Okla- 
homa without  my  county.  I  made  the  fight  for  him  there ;  but  I  do 
think  it  is  time  to  call  a  halt  on  personalities  and  to  stand  for  Democracy. 


240  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

I  am  willing  to  go  back  to  Oklahoma  with  the  record  I  make  in  this 
Convention.  I  am  willing  that  my  vote  be  cast  on  every  issue,  and  or 
every  man.  I  never  held  a  public  office  and  I  do  not  want  one.  Mj 
record  is  clear.  * 

A  DELEGATE:     You  may  go  back,  but  you  will  never  come  back. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Such  interruptions  are  discourteous, 
and  the  Chair  hopes  they  will  not  be  indulged  in. 

MR.  GIDDINGS,  of  Oklahoma  •  I  do  not  care  about  the  remark.  I  do 
not  know  who  the  gentleman  is,  and  I  do  not  care  who'he  is.  I  know  my 
Democratic  record  is  clean.  I  have  never  scratched  a  Democratic  ticket 
in  my  life.  Can  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  say  the  same?  [Ap- 
plause.] Gentlemen,  please  do  not  trespass  on  my  time.  I  have  only 
a  couple  of  minutes  remaining.  This  means  much  to  me. 

My  friends,  I  want  to  state  in  one  sentence  the  reason  for  my  clianyc. 
It  is  this,  that  if  the  dominance  of  this  man  prevails  the  nomination  of 
a  progressive  at  the  hands  of  this  Convention  is  gone.  My  friends,  I  am 
as  near  the  common  people  of  this  country  as  is  Mr.  Bryan.  For  ;: 
good  many  years  in  the  West  I  have  represented  the  Federation  of  Labor 
as  its  attorney.  I  know  its  needs,  and  I  know  it  does  not  want  a 
reactionary  nominated  at  the  hands  of  this  Convention.  I  ask  this  Con- 
vention to  turn  upon  Mr.  Bryan  and  paraphrase  a  saying  of  his  by  saying 
to  him,  ' '  You  shall  not  press  down  upon  the  brow  of  Democracy  a 
thorny  crown  of  anarchy.  You  shall  not  crucify  her  upon  a  cross  of 
selfishness."  I  vote  for  Clark.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  having  concluded  the  poll  of  the  Oklahoma  delegation, 
the  result  was  announced:  Clark  12%,  Wilson  7,  %  not  voting.  n&gt;

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  No  candidate  having  received  the  nec-

ballot. 

SIXTEENTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

The  State  of  Idaho  was  called,  and  Ihe  result  was  announced, 
Clark  8. 

MR.  A.  P.  HUTTEN,  of  Idaho:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  challenge  the  vote 
of  Idaho,  and  demand  a  poll. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of 
Idaho. 

MR.  JAMES  H.  HAWLEY,  of  Idaho  :  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Democratic 
State  Convention  of  Idaho  instructed  her  delegation  to  cast  its  vote  for 
Champ  Clark  as  long  as  the  delegates  were  satisfied  of  the  possibility 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  245 

of  liis  nomination.  Under  those  instructions  we  have  so  announced  the 
vote.  A  portion  of  the  delegation  questioned  this  authority,  and  desired 
to  break  their  instructions,  and  to  vote  for  another  candidate.  Under 
those  instructions  I  would  ask  if  the  delegation  has  the  right  so  to  do. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  question  submitted  by  the  State  of 
Idaho  is  whether  or  not  the  delegates  have  a  right  to  break  their 
instructions. 

The  State  Convention  of  Idaho  instructed  its  delegation  in  this  lan- 
guage: 

"Therefore,  be  it  resolved  by  the  Democrats  of  Idaho  in  State  con- 
vention assembled,  that  we  heartily  endorse  the  candidacy  of  Hon.  Champ 
Clark  for  nomination  as  the  Democratic  candidate  for  President,  and 
instruct  our  delegation  to  the  Baltimore  convention  to  use  all  honorable 
methods  to  secure  his  nomination,  and  to  vote  as  a  unit  for  him  until 
his  nomination,  or  as  long  as  there  is  reasonable  hope  of  his  nomination. ' ' 

If  a  majority  of  the  Idaho  delegation  are  willing  to  say  that  they 
have  no  reasonable  hope  of  Mr.  Clark 's  nomination,  then  they  can  dis- 
regard their  instructions  and  be  responsible  to  the  people. 

MR.  JAMES  H.  HAWLEY,  of  Idaho:  Mr.  Chairman,  Idaho  asks  to  be 
passed  until  the  conclusion  of  the  roll-call.  - 

The  Secretary  resumed  and  concluded  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  HAWLEY,  of  Idaho:     Mr.  Chairman,  Idaho  is  ready  to  vote. 

MR.  A.  P.  HUTTEN,  of  Idaho:  Let  us  have  a  poll  of  the  Idaho 
delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of  the 
Idaho  delegation. 

The  Idaho  delegation  was  polled,  and  the  result  was  as  follows:

*One-half  vote  each. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  Under  the  unit  rule,  a  majority  having 
voted  for  Clark,  the  vote  of  the  whole  delegation  will  be  recorded  foi 
Clark. 

MR.  HUTTEN,  of  Idaho:  Mr.  Chairman,  when  our  delegation  breaks, 
we  are  not  under  instructions  as  a  delegation. 

THE    PERMANENT    CHAIRMAN:      The   Chair   has   read    the   resolution 
adopted  in  Idaho,  upon  the  vote  as  a  unit,  which  is — 
' '  To  vote  as  a  unit  for  him  ' ' — 
That  is,  Champ  Clark— 

"until  his  nomination,  or  so  long  as  there  is  reasonable  hope  of 
his  nomination. ' ' 

Of  course  the  unit  rvrle  applies  only  to  Clark.  Therefore,  a  majority 
of  the  Idaho  delegation  voting  now  for  Clark,  the  whole  vote  is  cast  for 
him.  If  Mr.  Clark  were  not  a  candidate,  it  would  be  different.

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  No  candidate  having  received  the  neces- 
sary two-thirds  vote,  the  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  the  seventeenth 
ballot. 

SEVENTEENTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

MR.  A.  P.  HUTTEN,  of  Idaho  (when  the  State  of  Idaho  was  called): 
Mr.  Chairman,  we  are  under  the  unit  rule  so  far  as  Mr.  Clark  is  con 
cerned,  and  so  long  as  we  vote  as  a  unit  we  vote  for  Mr.  Clark ;  but 
when  our  delegation  breaks  we  are  not  under  the  unit  rule. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  instructions  read:  "until  his  nomi- 
nation, or  so  long  as  there  is  reasonable  hope  of  his  nomination."  Of 
course  the  unit  rule  applies  to  Mr.  Clark,  and  therefore  a  majority  of 
your  delegation  having  voted  for  Mr.  Clark,  the  whole  vote  is  directed  to 
be  cast  for  him. 

MR.  JAMES  H.  HAWLEY,  of  Idaho:     Certainly. 

MR.  HUTTEN,  of  Idaho:     I  demand  a  poll  of  the  Idaho  delegation. 

The  Secretary  polled  the  Idaho  delegation  and  the  result  was  as 
follows :

DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  249 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  There  are  sixteen  delegates  from  Idaho, 
nine  of  whom  are  present,  and  seven  are  absent.  Upon  the  poll  of  the 
delegation,  four  of  them  voted  for  Clark  and  five  voted  for  Kern.  The 
Chair  holds  that  that  being  a  majority  of  the  delegation,  the  delegates 
upon  the  floor  have  a  right  to  control  the  vote  of  the  State,  that  is,  the 
vote  that  is  present  when  it  is  cast  for  anyone  other  than  the  one  directed 
in  the  resolution  as  to  the  unit  rule.  Therefore,  the  Chair  directs  that 
the  vote  of  Idaho  be  cast  2  for  Clark,  24  for  Kern,  and  3£  not  voting. 
(Applause.) 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

Mi;.  GEORGE  F.  MILTON,  of  Tennessee  (when  the  State  of  Tennessee 
was  called) :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  demand  a  poll  of  the  Tennessee- delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  A  poll  of  the  Tennessee  delegation 
being  demanded,  the  Secretary  will  call  the  rcll  of  that  State. 

The  Secretary  polled  the  Tennessee  delegation,  and  the  result  was  as

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll  of  States,  etc. 

MR.  WILLIAM  KENSINGER,  of  Iowa  (when  the  State  of  Iowa  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  Iowa  desires  to  be  polled.  There  is  a  difference 
among  the  delegates. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     The  Iowa  delegation  will  be  polled. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  poll  the  Iowa  delegation. 

MR.  KENSINGER,  of  Iowa  (when  his  name  was  called)  :  Mr.  Chair- 
man, I  rise  to  a  question  of  information. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  gentleman  will  state  it. 

MR.  KENSINGER,  of  Iowa :  As  I  understand,  a  motion  was  agreed  to 
in  our  delegation  to  release  the  delegates  from  their  instructions  to  vote 
as  a  unit.  I  understand  that  motion  was  carried.  If  it  was,  are  we  per- 
mitted to  vote  individually? 

THE  PEKMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  gentlemen  are.

MR.  WILLIAM  MULVANEY,  of  Iowa:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  object  to  the 
vote  of  the  State  of  Iowa,  for  the  reason  that  the  delegates  from  that 
State  were  instructed  by  the  State  convention  to  vote  as  a  unit  for 
Champ  Clark  for  President.  There  was  no  option  given  as  to  a  choice 
for  any  other  candidate  or  to  determine  as  to  when  it  was  proper  to 
abandon  the  trust  that  was  reposed  in  them.  I  challenge  the  vote  for 
that  reason. 

MR.  C.  E.  PORTER,  of. Iowa:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a  point  of  order. 
Our  delegation  in  conference  today  passed  the  following — 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     Was  it  by  a.  majority  vote? 

MR.  PORTER,  of  Iowa :     Yes.    I  am  the  chairman  of  the  delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  asks  if  the  unit  rule  was 
abrogated  by  a  majority  vote? 

MR.  PORTER,  of  Iowa:  I  as  chairman  of  the  delegation  am  unable  to 
answer,-  and  being  unable  to  answer,  and  in  order  to  be  fair  to  evi-rv 
member  of  the  delegation,  I  ask  for  a  poll  of  the  delegation  on  that 
question  first. 

MR.  MULVANEY,  of  Iowa:     That  is  satisfactory. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  According  to  the  poll,  a  majority  hav- 
ing voted  for  Clark,  and  the  delegation  having  been  instructed  by  IJie 
State  Convention  to  vote  as  a  unit  for  him,  the  Chair  holds  that  the  vote 
of  Iowa  must  be  cast  for  Clark.  [Applause.] 

MR.  C.  C.  GETHMAN,  of  Iowa:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  appeal  from  the 
decision  of  the  Chair.  A  majority  of  the  delegation  released  us  from  our 
trust,  and  said  we  could  vote  as  we  pleased. 

MR.  JAMES  A.  EEED,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  to  lay  the 
appeal  on  the  table. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  gentleman  from  Missouri  moves 
to  lay  the  appeal  on  the  table. 

MR.  A.  S.  BURLESON,  of  Texas:  I  demand  the  yeas  and  nays  on  that 
motion. 

MR.  GETHMAN,  of  Iowa:     Mr.  Chairman.  I  withdraw  the  appeal. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  appeal  being  withdrawn,  the  vote 
of  Iowa  will  be  recorded  for  Clark. 

The  Secretary  will  proceed  with  the  call  of  the  roll  of  States,  etc.

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :    No  candidate  has  received  the  necessary 
two-thirds  vote. 
—  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  the  next  ballot. 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  STONE,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  the  unani- 
mous consent  of  this  Convention  to  the  following  agreement :  That  after 
two  additional  ballots,  on  the  third  ballot  the  candidate  receiving  the 
smallest  number  of  votes  be  dropped,  and  after  the  next  ballot  there- 
after the  candidate  receiving  the  smallest  vote  on  that  ballot  be  dropped, 
and  so  on  until  the  last  ballot,  and  that  on  that  ballot  the  candidate 
receiving  the  greater  number  of  votes  be  declared  the  nominee  of  the 
Convention. 

MR.  ALBERT  S.  BURLESON,  of  Texas:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  object. 

MR.  ROBERT  L.  HENRY,  of  Texas:     I  object. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Senator  from  Missouri  (Mr. 
Stone)  makes  this  request  for  unanimous  consent — that  the  Convention 
proceed  to  take  two  more  ballots,  and  that  thereafter,  upon  the  third 
ballot,  the  candidate  receiving  the  smallest  number  of  votes  be  dropped, 
and  so  on  until  a  nomination  is  made,  and  that  the  candidate  receiving 
the  majority  of  the  votes  upon  the  last  ballot  be  declared  the  nominee. 


271 

To  that  request  Congressman  Burleson,  of  Texas,  and  Congressman 
Henry,  of  Texas,  object. 

The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  the  next  ballot. 

MR.  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  Mr.  Chairman,  a  ques- 
tion of  order.  « 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  gentleman  from  Mississippi  will 
state  it. 

MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  Is  unanimous  consent  required  for 
the  request  made? 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Certainly.  The  Chair  so  stated,  and 
objection  was  made. 

MR.  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  Mr.  Chairman,  would  that  unanimous 
consent,  if  given,  preserve  inviolate  the  two-thirds  rule  of  a  Democratic 
national  convention? 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  object 
to  the  request  for  unanimous  consent. 

MR.  LUKE  LEA,  of  Tennessee :     Mr.  Chairman,  I  also  object. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Objection  being  made,  the  Secretary 
will  call  the  roll  for  the  twenty-fifth  ballot.

DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  273 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  James  Hamilton  Lewis,  of  Illinois,  in 
the  chair)  :  No  candidate  having  received  the  necessary  two-thirds,  the 
Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  the  twenty-sixth  ballot. 

TWENTY-SIXTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

MR.  HENRY  HEITFSLD,  of  Idaho  (when  the  State  of  Idaho  was  called) : 
Mr.  Chairman,  I  desire  to  know  how  the  vote  of  Idaho  is  recorded  on  the 
last  ballot. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     Eight  votes  for  Wilson. 

Mi;.  HEITFELD,  of  Idaho:     I  object. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     Upon  what  ground? 

MR.  HEITFELD,  of  Idaho:  I  have  not  given  any  authority  to  anyone, 
on  this  or  any  other  ballot,  to  cast  my  vote  for  Wilson.  I  vote  for  Clark. 
I  insist  upon  one-half  vote  being  recorded  from  Idaho  for  Mr.  Clark. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Does  the  unit  rule  bind  the  delegation? 
Did  the  State  Convention  of  Idaho  adopt  the  unit  rule? 

MR.  HEITFELD,  of  Idaho:     Only  so  far  as  Mr.  Clark  was  concerned. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     Is  that  resolution  in  your  possession? 

MR.  HEITFELD.  of  Idaho:  The  Permanent  Chairman  has  ruled  on  the 
resolution. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  What  was  the  ruling?  The  present  occu- 
pant of  the  chair  is  not  informed  upon  that  subject,  as  he  was  not  in  the 
chair  at  the  time. 

MR.  HEITFELD,  of  Idaho:  The  ruling  was  that  we  were  under  the 
jnit  rule  as  long  as  we  were  voting  for  Mr.  Clark.  The  instructions  in 
regard  to  that  were  read. 

MR.  B.  H.  MILLER,  of  Idaho:  There  is  no  objection  to  one-half  vote 
being  cast  for  Mr.  Clark. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Let  the  vote  of  Idaho  be  corrected  by 
recording  it  1\  votes  for  Wilson  and  -}  for  Clark. 

MR.  JOHN  WALTER  SMITH,  of  Maryland  (when  the  State  of  Maryland 
was  called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  state  that  in  response  to  the 
wishes  of  a  majority  of  the  delegates  from  my  State  I  feel  it  my  duty 
at  this  time  to  announce  16  votes  for  Clark.  At  the  same  time  I  want 
to  state  that  there  will  be  two  gentlemen,  representing  one  vote,  who 
will  have  something  to  say  of  the  manner  in  which  I  have  cast  the  vote  of 
Maryland. 

MR.  GUY  W.  STEELE,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  demand  a  poll 
of  the  Maryland  delegation. 

MR.  ARTHUR  P.  GORMAN,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  before  the 
roll  of  the  Maryland  delegation  is  called  I  ask  that  the  resolution  passed 
by  the  Maryland  Democratic  State  Convention  be  read. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     The  request  of  the  gentleman  will  be  con- 


274  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

sidered  by  the  Chair  after  the  poll.  The  Secretary  will  first  call  the  roll 
of  the  Maryland  delegation. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  poll  the  Maryland  delegation.  • 

MR.  ISIBOR  RAYNER,  of  Maryland  (when  his  name  was  called) :  Mr. 
Chairman,  under  the  tows  of  the  State  of  Maryland  I  have  the  right  to 
vote,  and  T  do  vote  for  Mr.  Wilson. 

MR.  MAX  WAYS,  of  Maryland  (when  his  name  was  called)  :  Mr.  Chair- 
man, T  vote  as  the  people  of  Maryland,  instructed  me  to  vote,  for  Champ 
Clark. 

The  Secretary  completed  the  poll  of  the  Maryland  delegation. 

MR.  S.  S.  FIELD,  of  Maryland :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  make  the  point  of 
order  that  when  delegates  are  instructed  under  the  unit  rule,  the  ma- 
jority having  voted  for  Clark,  the  vote  of  the  State  must  be  cast  for 
hi  171. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Chair  desires  to  see  the  instructions 
passed  by  the  Maryland  State  Convention.  The  Secretary  informs  the 
Chair  that  there  are  no  instructions  here. 

MR.  JOSHUA  W.  MILES,  of  Maryland:     There  are  no  instructions. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  No  matter  what  the  reason  is,  the  in- 
structions are  not  here,  and  as  they  are  not  here,  the  point\  of  order  is 
overruled,  and  the  vote  will  be  recorded  in  accordance  with  the  result 
of  the  poll. 

MR.  FIELD,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  in  my  hand  the 
statute  of  the  State  of  Maryland,  triiich  provides  that  all  the  delegates 
selected  by  a  State  Convention  to  a  National  Convention  shall  be  in- 
structed and  bound  to  vote  as  a  unit  in  the  National  Convention  for 
such  candidate  for  President,  so  selected  as  the  choice  of  the  State  of 
Maryland  as  aforesaid,  and  such  delegates  shall  continue  to  vote  in  such 
National  Convention  lor  the  choice  of  the  State  of  Maryland  as  long 
as  in  their  conscientious  judgment  there  is  any  possibility  of  his  being 
nominated. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  This  law  provides  that  where  the  dele- 
gates are  chosen  at  a  primary,  they  are  under  a  different  rule  than 
where  they  come  from  a  State  Convention.  No  resolution  passed  by  the 
State  Convention  is  produced  here. 

MR.  FIELD,  of  Maryland:     There  was  a  resolution  passed. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     It  is  not  here. 

Mn.  FIELD,  of  Maryland:  The  delegates  are  elected,  not  by  the  con- 
vention, but  by  the  counties. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  This  says  "as  long  as  in  their  con- 
scientious judgment  there  is  a  possibility  of  his  nomination." 

MK.  FIEI«D,  of  Maryland:  I  withdraw  the  point  of  order,  and  we  will 
renew  it  when  we  have  our  resolution. 

The  Secretary  resumed  and  concluded  the  poll  of  the  Maryland  dele- 
gation, and  the  result  was  as  follows:

RESOLUTION  BY  MR.  WILLIAMS,  OF  MISSISSIPPI. 

- 

Mi:.  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  desire 
to  offer  a  resolution,  and  have  it  referred  to  the  Committee  on  Resolu- 
tions. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     The  Chair  will  so  refer  it. 

ADJOURNMENT. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Con 
vention  has  now  been  in  continuous  session  since  one  o'clock  this  after 
noon,  a  period  of  nearly  ten  hours.  This  session  followed  one  last  night 
of  aftout  the  same  length  of  time,  which  extended  through  the  entire 
night.  For  many  of  the  delegates  upon  this  floor  the  great  work  which 
we  have  been  performing  here  has  been  such  a  strain  that  the  limit  of 
physical  endurance  has  nearly  been  reached.  It  is  very  evident  that  the' 
work  of  this  Convention  cannot  be  concluded  by  midnight,  and  it  is 
extremely  desirable  that  we  should  not  engage  in  the  work  of  the  Con- 
vention upon  the  Sabbath  day. 

The  motion  which  I  am  about  to  make  is  net  made  with  any  desire 
to  secure  advantage  for  any  candidate  for  the  office  of  President;  bill 
gentlemen  representing  all  of  the  candidates  now  being  balloted  for  an'! 
who  have  been  most  active  in  furthering  their  interests  upon  the  floor 


278  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

have  agreed  to  the  motion  which  I  shall  make.     I  therefore  move  that 
this  Convention  adjourn  until  12  o'clock  on  Monday  next. 

MR.  DAVID  B.  FRANCIS,  of  Missouri :  In  accordance  with  the  agree 
ment  entered  into  by  the  representatives  of  the  candidates  for  the  nomi 
nation,  for  the  reasons  stated  by  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania,  1 
desire  to  second  the  motion. 

MR.  THOMAS  H.  BALL,  of  Texas:  I  move  to  amend  by  making  it  10 
o  'clock,  in  response  to  the  request  of  all  the  delegates  about  me. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  I  will  modify  the  motion  and  make 
it  11  o  'clock.  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  amend  my  motion,  and  make  it 
11  o'clock. 

MR.  BALL,  of  Texas:     We  accept  11  o'clock. 

MR.  GEORGE  H.  GIFFORD,  of  Indiana:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  at 
future  sessions  of  this  Convention  all  persons  be  excluded  except  dele- 
gates and  alternates,  representatives  of  the  press  and  the  officials  con 
nected  with  the  Convention,  so  that  we  can  do  business. 

MR.  F.  H.  McCuLLOUGH,  of  Missouri:     I  second  ihe  motion. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  make  the  point  of 
order  that  Ihe  resolution  offered  by  the  gentleman  from  Indiana  is  not 
in  order.  The  motion  to  adjourn  is  not  debatable,  and  no  resolution  can 
be  received  while  it  is  pending. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania 
makes  the  point  of  order  that  the  motion  of  the  gentleman  from  Indiana 
is  not  in  order.  The  Chair  sustains  the  point  of  order. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  My  motion  has  been  changed,  and  in 
its  present  form  it  is  that  the  Convention  adjourn  until  Monday  next  ah 
11  o  'clock  a.  m. 

MR.  ROGER  C.  SULLIVAN,  of  Illinois:  I  move  the  adoption  of  that 
motion. 

MR.  W.  H.  MURRAY,  of  Oklahoma:  I  move  to  substitute  "nine 
o  'clock ' '  for  ' '  eleven  o  'clock. ' ' 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  1  make  the  point  of  order  that  my 
motion  is  not  debatable. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  point  of  order  is  made  by  the 
gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  against  the  substitute  offered  by  the  dele- 
gate from  Oklahoma,  and  the  point  of  order  is  sustained. 

The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the  motion  of  the  gentleman  from 
Pennsylvania  that  the  Contention  adjourn  until  11  o'clock  a.  m.  on 
Monday  next. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to,  and  (at  11  o'clock  and  55  minutes  p.  m.) 
the  Convention  adjourned  until  Monday,  July  1,  1912,  at  11  o'clock  a.  m. 


SIXTH  DAY 


CONVENTION  HALL, 
MARYLAND  REGIMENT  ARMORY, 
BALTIMORE,  MD.,  July  1,  1912. 
The  Convention  met  at  11  o'clock  a.  m. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  Rev.  S.  Carroll  Coale,  assistant  pastor 
First  Methodist  Episcopal  Church,  Baltimore,  will  offer  prayer. 

PRAYER   OF  REV.   S.   CARROLL  COALE. 

Rev.  S.  Carroll  Coale,  assistant  pastor  First  Methodist  Episcopal 
Church,  Baltimore,  offered  the  following  prayer: 

"Almighty  and  Everlasting  God,  our  Father,  we  would  stop  for  a 
moment  in  the  bustle  and  confusion  of  life,  that  we  might  guide  our 
souls  and  our  minds,  and  place  ourselves  before  Thee  and  in  Thy  hands; 
for  we  can  do  nothing  apart  from  Thy  power.  We  thank  Thee  for  Thy 
love  and  Tli-y  strength  and  Thy  compassion,  which  have  guided  us  in 
the  days  that  have  gone.  We  come  to  Thee  relying  upon  Thy  love  and 
Thy  power,  asking  that  Thou  wilt  continue  to  guide  us  in  whatever  we 
may  do.  We  ask  that  Thou  wilt  watch  over  this  great  assemblage  gath- 
ered here  in  the  interest  of  our  nation.  We  honor  Thee  and  thank 
Thee  for  Thy  watchful  care  over  our  nation,  and  we  thank  Thee  that 
Thou  hast  not  been  forgetful  of  those  individuals  who  have  worked 
for  the  welfare  of  this  our  nation.  We  pray  Thee  this  morning,  as  we 
gather  here,  that  Thou  wilt  look  into  the  life  of  every  man  who  has 
assembled  here;  and  may  we  feel  that  the  guiding  hand  of  Providence, 
with  Thy  love,  which  surmounts  all  human  love,  is  guiding  us  here. 

' '  We  pray  that  Thou  wilt  bless  every  one  of  us,  and  that  Thou  wilt 
bless  everything  that  is  done.  Every  effort  that  is  put  forth  for  the 
advancement  of  this  nation,  may  it  be  some  effort  for  the  advancement 
of  the  Kingdom  of  God.  Do  Thou  bless  every  man,  do  Thou  bless  every 
woman,  and  do  Thou  bless  every  leader,  and  everyone  who  is  to  follow. 
May  Thy  guidance  so  be  that  guidance  which  is  ours,  as  that  we  shall  be 
led  into  ways  of  everlasting  life.  We  pray  Thee,  Oh  God,  that  we  may 
so  live  in  the  presence  of  the  Eternal  Christ  as  that  His  love  and  His 
compassion  may  be  the  ruling  passion  of  our  lives.  Help  us,  we  pray, 
so  to  be  surrounded  by  His  arms  and  encompassed  by  His  love  that  we 
may  do  those  things  which  will  redound  to  His  glory  and  honor. 

"Bless  us,  Oh  Christ,  in  everything  we  shall  undertake;   and  when 

279

OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 


we  shall  have  passed  out  of  this  great  life  on  earth,  may  we  stand  at 
last  on  the  shores  of  Eternal  Life,  a  great  assemblage  of  those  who  have 
been  faithful,  and  that  we  shall  hear  Thee  make  that  great  pronounce- 
ment, 'Well  done,  good  and  faithful  servant,  enter  thou  into  the  JQJ 
of  thy  Lord.'  Now,  we  ask  Thee  again,  Oh  God,  that  Thou  wilt  guide 
us  in  everything  that  is  done  this  day  in  this  place. 

"We  pray  that  nothing  may  happen  in  this  Convention  to  mar  its 
glorious  record ;  and  whatever  may  be  done,  we  pray  Thee,  may  it 
redound  to  the  credit  of  the  nation  and  to  the  glory  of  God.  Let  Thy 
hand  be  on  us,  let  Thy  words  be  whispered  in  our  ears,  let  Thy  presence 
so  haunt  us  as  that  we  shall  feel  that  God  is  near ;  and  whatever  we 
shall  do,  may  it  speak  so  loudly  of  the  presence  of  God  as  that  men 
shall  say,  'God  was  present  with  them.-  We  ask  it  all  in  the  name  of 
Him  who  has  taught  us  to  pray:  Our  Father  who  art  in  Heaven,  hallowed 
be  Thy  name;  Thy  kingdom  come,  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth  as  it  is  in 
Heaven.  Give  us  this  day  our  daily  bread,  and  forgive  us  our  trespasses 
as  we  forgive  those  who  trespass  against  us.  And  lead  us  not  into 
temptation,  but  deliver  us  from  evil;  for  Thine  is  the  Kingdom,  and  the 
Power,  and  the  Glory,  forever  and  ever.  Amen. ' ' 


VOTE  FOR  CANDIDATE  FOR  PRESIDENT. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  order  of  business  before  the 
Convention  is  the  calling  of  the  roll  of  States,  etc.,  for  the  nomination 
of  a  candidate  for  President.  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of 
States,  etc.,  for  the  twenty-seventh  ballot. 

TWENTY-SEVENTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

The  State  of  New  York  was  called,  and  the  vote  was  announced. 
Clark  90. 

MR.  W.  H.  EDSON,  of  New  York:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  challenge  the 
vote  of  the  New7  York  delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  vote  of  the  State  of  New  York 
is  challenged.  The  Secretary  will  call  the  names  of  the  New  York 
delegates. 

MR.  JOHN  B.  STANCHFIELD,  of  New  York  (when  his  name  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  of  the  Convention 
to  explain  my  vote. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Mr.  John  B.  Stanchfield,  a  delegate 
from  New  York,  asks  unanimous  consent  to  explain  his  vote.  Is  there 
objection!  The  Chair  hears  none,  and  the  gentleman  is  recognized. 

MR.  STANCHFIELD,  of  New  York:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
of  the  Convention,  I  come  from  a  State  whose  electoral  vote  is  indis- 
pensable to  Democratic  suci-css.  If  memory  serves  me  well,  upon  only 
two  occasions  in  the  history  of  our  country  has  a  Democratic  President 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  281 

been  elected  without  the  electoral '  vote  of  the  State  of  New  York. 
We  represent  a  population  approximating  10,000,000.  We  cast  in  the 
neighborhood  of  1,750,000  votes.  We  represent  45  votes  in  the  electoral 
college  to  come,  aud  I  am  speaking  here  now  in  explanation  of  my 
vote  on  behalf  of  the  Empire  State  representing  generally  as  it  does 
one-tenth  of  the  Government  of  the  United  States. 

Now,  a  word  as  to  the  history  of  the  Democratic  party  in  the  State 
of  New  York.  For  the  first  time  since  the  administration  of  Governor 
Flower  we  have  a  Democratic  governor. 

MR.  EDWIN  O.  WTOOD,  of  Michigan:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  would  like 
to  ask  if  there  is  any  limit  on  the  gentleman's  time? 

MR.  STANCHFIELD,  of  New  York:  I  will  say  to  the  gentleman  from 
Michigan  that  New  York  has  a  right  to  be  heard  upon  the  floor  of 
this  Convention.  [Applause.]  The  integrity,  the  manhood,  the  per- 
sonal and  the  political  honor  of  every  delegate  of  the  90  from  the 
State  of  New  York  have  been  impugned  and  insulted  upon  the  floor 
of  this  Convention.  [Applause.]  I  have  a  right  to  be  heard  in  its 
defense,  and  I  desire  to  say  at  the  outset,  in  order  that  I  may  receive 
a  fair  hearing  at  the  hands  of  this  Convention,  and  particularly  I  desire  1 
to  say  to  the  followers  of  Colonel  Bryan,  that  I  am  one  of  those  who,  '• 
back  in  the  dark  nights  of  1896,  followed  the  flag  of  Colonel  Bryan, 
and  spoke  in  city,  village,  and  hamlet  in  favor  of  his  election. 
[Applause.] 

In  the  year  1900  I,  candidate  of  the  party  for  governor,  ran  upon 
the  Democratic  ticket  with  Colonel  Bryan,  and  he  polled  with  me  upon 
that  ticket  more  votes  by  upwards  of  100,000  than  he  polled  before 
or  has  polled  since.  Therefore  I  repeat  that  among  -the  friends  of 
Colonel  Bryan  I  am  entitled  to  a  hearing  upon  the  floor  of  this 
Convention. 

Let  us  look  for  a  moment  at  the  makeup  of  the  delegation  from 
New  York.  We  have  here  the  Democratic  governor,  and  the  lieutenant- 
governor  of  the  State.  [Applause.]  We  have  upon  the  delegation 
the  man  who  was  the  Democratic  candidate  for  President  of  the  United 
States  in  1904.  [Applause.]  We  have  an  ex-justice  of  the  Supreme 
Court  of  the  State.  We  have  lawyers  of  repute,  business  men,  pro- 
fessional men,  and  men  in  every  walk  and  department  of  life;  and  it 
is  by  common  consent  the  most  representative  delegation  that  ever 
came  to  a  National  Convention  from  the  State  of  New  York.  They 
would  need  no  defense  except  for  what  has  been  said  upon  the  floor  of 
this  Convention.  If  this  delegation,  so  composed,  be  the  puppets 
of  wax,  as  insinuated  by  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska,  we  say  to  that 
money-grabbing,  selfish,  office-seeking,  favor-hunting,  publicity-loving 
marplot  from  Nebraska  that  if  the  ninety  delegates  from  New  York, 
who  are  of  the  character  I  have  described  are  within  the  control  and 
power  of  one  man,  they  are  moved  by  wires  of  tremendous  human 
voltage. 


282  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Let  us  look  for  a  moment  and  see  whether  or  not  the  accusation 
of  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  be  true.  Let  us  look  at  the  record 
for  a  passing  minute.  The  Democracy  have  in  the  House  of  Repre- 
sentatives from  the  State  of  -New  York  twenty-two  members.  We  have 
the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Appropriations.  We  have  the 
Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs;  and  upon  the  fifteen 
great  progressive  measures  that  have  been  pending  this  Congress,  advo- 
cated under  the  leadership  of  Clark  and  Underwood,  every  vote  of  those 
twenty-two  men  has  been  registered  in  accordance  with  the  progressive 
Democracy  of  today.  [Applause.] 

The  gentleman  from  Nebraska  (Mr.  Bryan)  has  said  that  no  candi- 
date who  has  behind  him  the  vote  of  the  ninety  men  from  New  York 
can  go  forth  from  this  Convention  with  hope  or  expectation  of  success. 
I  desire  in  reply  to  say  that  the  vote  of  New  York  is  vital  to  success, 
and  no  man  can  go  forth  from  this  Convention  stigmatized  and  branded 
with  Bryanism,  and  come  within  half  a  million  votes  of  carrying  the 
State  of  New  York.  [Applause.] 

Mr.  Bryan  has  said  that  no  man  having  the  support  of  the  New 
York  delegation  can  be  elected  at  the  polls,  because  they  are  under 
the  influence  of  Eyan  and  Morgan  and  Belmont.  He  has  stated  that 
no  man  can  be  elected  by  reason  of  their  influence.  I  desire  to  say 
to  him,  in  behalf  of  the  ninety  delegates  from  New  York,  that  there 
is  no  man  in  the  number  who  by  his  professional  or  business  relation 
or  otherwise,  is  under  the  influence  of  either  of  the  men  he  has  named; 
and  when  he  makes  the  statement  that  these  men,  Morgan  and  Eyan  and 
Belmont,  are  the  plutocrats  of  this  Convention,  he  omits  one  name; 
and  of  all  the  .delegates  upon  the  floor  of  this  Convention  outside  of 
the  three  he  has  named,  the  richest  and  the  most  powerful  is  the  gentle- 
man from  Nebraska.  [Applause.] 

If  the  New  York  delegation  is  to  be  prevented  from  voting  for  the 
candidate  of  this  Convention,  then  there  ought  to  be  passed  a  resolution 

(depriving  it  of  a  seat  in  this  Convention.     Any  man  who  for  pay  has 
been  writing  from  the  Eepublican  Convention  in  favor  of  the  election 
of   Mr.    Bryan's   partner   and    ally,    Theodore   Eoosevelt,    ought    to   be 
expelled    from    the    floor    of    the    Convention.      Colonel    Bryan    never 
t  intended    to    support    the    candidate    of    this    Convention    unless    that 
'  candidate  should  be  Bryan  himself.     [Applause.]     We  have  heard  for 
months  gone  by  that  Colonel  Bryan,  by  his  voice  and   influence,  was 
supporting    Woodrow    Wilson    in    one    place,    that    he    was    supporting 
Champ   Clark  in  another,  that   he  was   combatting   Harmon   here  and 

I  Underwood  there,  all   of  the  time   desiring  and   intending,   in  pursuit 
of  his  own  selfish  ends,  to  produce  a  deadlock  in  this  Convention,  in 
order  that  he  might  be  the  recipient  of  the  fruits  of  the  controversy 
;  and  the  discord  so  engendered. 

When  the  New  York  delegation  came  to  Baltimore  to  attend  this 
Convention  we  were  voting  under  the  unit  rule,  and  a  majority  of  the 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  283 

New  York  delegation  registered  their  vote  in  favor  of  Governor  Harmon, 
of  Ohio.  We  supported  and.  maintained  that  nomination,  so  long  as  it 
appeared  to  the  majority  to  be  advisable.  New  York  next  cast  her 
vote  in  favor  of  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Kepresentatives,  because 
he  was  the  strongest  candidate  before  this  Convention,  and  the  delega- 
tion today  is  in  favor  of  any  and  every  man  who  can  be  the  candidate 
and  the  nominee  of  this  Convention.  [Applause.]  So  far  as  I  am 
personally  concerned  I  have  said  what  I  desired  in  explanation  of  my 
personal  vote  and  it  is  cast  for  Woodrow  Wilson,  of  New  Jersey._ 
[Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  Secretary  will  continue  to  call 
the  roll-call  of  New  York. 

The   Secretary   resumed   and   concluded  the   roll-call    of  New   York. 
The  result  was  as  follows:

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :    Upon  the  poll  of  the  delegation  from 
the  State  of  New  York,  Underwood   receives   2   votes,   Wilson  9   votes, 
Clark  78  votes,  one  not  voting.     New  York  voting  under  the  unit  rule, 
the  90  votes  of  that  delegation  are  cast  for  Clark.     [Applause.] 
The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll  of  States. 
The  State  of  Wisconsin  was  called,  and   the  vote  was  announced — 
Wilson  20,  Clark  5,  Bryan  1. 

MR.  Louis  BACHHUBER,  of  Wisconsin:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  vote  of 
Wisconsin  was  reported  wrong.  Mr.  Lawrence  McGreal,  a  Clark  delegate, 
left  his  proxy  with  me  to  vote  for  Mr.  Clark  as  long  as  the  Clark  dele- 
gates stuck  by  him,  and  the  Clark  delegates  of  Wisconsin  demand  that 
the  vote  of  the  Clark  delegates  be  recorded  correctly. 

MR.  E.  B.  KIRKLAND,  of  Wisconsin:     Mr.   Chairman,  I  am  the  last 


286  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

man  upon  the  floor  of  this  Convention  who  would  record  the  vote  of  any 
man  incorrectly.  Mr.  McGreal,  a  duly  elected  delegate  from  Wisconsin, 
is  absent.  His  alternate  is  in  his  place,  and  I  have  simply  recorded  the 
vote  of  the  alternate,  as  the  alternate  has  instructed  me  to  cast  tBat 
vote,  no  more  and  no  less.  If  I  am  wrong  I  am  willing  to  stand  cor- 
rected. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Is  there  any  dispute  in  the  delegation 
as  to  the  alternate's  vote? 

MR.  KIRKLAND,  of  Wisconsin:  None.  The  alternate  is  in  his  seat, 
and  has  instructed  me  as  chairman  of  the  delegation  to  cast  his  vote. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  delegate  from  that  district  is  not 
in  the  Convention? 

MR.  KIRKLAND,  of  Wisconsin:  The  delegate  from  that  district  has 
gone  home. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  If  the  Chair  understands  the  question 
at  issue,  the  claim  is  made  that  the  delegate  left  a  written  proxy  to 
vote  for  Clark. 

MR.  KIRKLAND,  of  Wisconsin:    I  have  not  seen  it. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  rules  that  no  proxies  can  be 
voted.  If  the  delegate  is  not  here,  the  alternate's  vote  must  be  recorded. 

The  Secretary  having  resumed  and  concluded  the  calling  of  the  roll 
of  States,  etc.,  the  result  was  announced  —  Clark  469,  Wilson  406$, 
Underwood  112,  Foss  38,  Marshall  30,  Harmon  29,  Bryan  1,  not  voting 
2J  —  as  follows:

MR.  JOHN  B.  KNOX,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  before  another 
ballot  is  taken  I  ask  unanimous  consent  to  introduce  a  short  resolution, 
to  be  referred_to  the  Committee  on  Resolutions.  It  is  not  in  the  interest 
of  any  ^candidate,  but  simply  in  the  interest  of  general  harmony  among 
all  the  delegates  of  the  Convention. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  refers  the  resolution,  with- 
out reading  or  debate,  to  the  Committee  on  Resolutions.

And  we  further  certify  that  the  following  resolution  was  adopted: 
"Be  it  resolved,  That  we  hereby  endorse  the  Hon.  Champ  Clark  of 
Missouri  as  candidate  for  President  of  tbe  United  States,  and  we  hereby 
instruct  our  delegation  to  the  Baltimore  Convention  to  use  all  their 
influence,  and  every  effort  in  their  power,  to  secure  the  nomination  of 
Hon.  Champ  Clark  for  President  on  every  ballot  on  which  his  name  is 
before  the  Convention,  or  until  in  the  opinion  of  the  majority  of  such 
delegates  his  nomination  can  no  longer  be  reasonably  hoped  for. ' ' 

This  resolution  is  signed  by  the  chairman  and  secretary  of  the  con- 
vention. Upon  the  poll  of  the  delegation,  five  voted  for  Clark  and 
three  for  Wilson.  The  Chair  holds  that  the  instructions  given  by  the 
New  Mexico  State  Convention  apply  the  unit  rule  to  the  vote  of  that

Mi:.  E.  J.  CiiDDixcs,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  challenge  the

MR.  R.  L.  WILLIAMS:      We  withdraw  that,  Mr.  Chairman. 

MR.  E.  J.  GIEDIXGS,  of  Oklahoma:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  deny  the  right 
of  any  man  to  withdraw  my  challenge.  It  is  my  individual  challenge, 
and  you  cannot  withdraw  it. 

THE  PERMAXEXT  CHAIRMAX  :  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  No  candidate  having  received  the

ballot. 

TWENTY-NINTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

MR.  C.  R.  PORTER,  of  Iowa  (when  the  State  of  Iowa  was  called) : 
Mr.  Chairman,  a  paper  was  circulated  among  the  delegation  and 
passed  to  me  as  Chairman,  stating  that  a  majority  of  the  delegates 
voted  to  absolve  the  delegates  from  the  unit  rule,  some  of  the  delegates 
refusing  to  vote.  In  answer  to  that  I  took  a  poll  of  the  delegation 
with  this  result:  Clark  14$,  Wilson  11$. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  entire  vote  of  Iowa  will  be  cast 
for  Clark. 


292  .  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  WILLIAM  KENSIXGER,  of  Iowa:     A  point  of  order,  Mr.  Chairman. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  gentleman  will  state  it. 

MR.  KENSINGER,  of  Iowa:  The  point  of  order  is  that  the  Iowa 
delegation,  by  a  majority  vote,  released  the  delegates  from  Iowa  from 
voting  as  a  unit.  If  a  majority  of  the  delegates  vote  for  Woodrow 
Wilson,  then  the  unit  rule,  if  it  applies,  casts  all  of  the  votes  for 
Woodrow  Wilson,  but  if  the  Chairman  has  stated  it  correctly,  then 
the  whole  vote  is  for  Champ  Clark. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  If  the  Iowa  delegation  desire  a  roll- 
call,  the  Chair  will  order  it;  and  if  a  majority  vote  for  Wilson,  then 
the  unit  rule,  if  it  applies,  will  result  in  the  vote  of  the  entire  delega- 
tion being  cast  for  Wilson. 

MR.  PORTER,  of  Iowa:  In  order  that  the  Chair  may  understand  the 
situation,  I  Avill  state  that  the  resolution  was  adopted,  as  shown  by 
the  signature  of  a  majority  of  the  Iowa  delegation.  The  resolution 
reads  as  follows  — 

MR.  N.  D.  ELY,  of  Iowa  :     A  point  of  order,  Mr.  Chairman. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     The  gentleman  will  state  it. 

MR.  ELY,  of  Iowa:  The  point  of  order  is  that  nothing  is  in  order 
except  the  vote  of  this  delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  That  is  correct.  If  the  gentleman 
desires  a  poll  of  the  delegation,  the  Chair  will  order  it.  No  poll  being 
demanded,  the  Secretary  will  proceed  with  the  call  of  States. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  B.  J.  SHERIDAN,  of  Kansas  (when  the  State  of  Kansas  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  we  want  the  vote  of  Kansas  polled  at  this 
time. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  Kansas  delegation  will  be  polled. 

MR.  B.  S.  GAITSKELL:  Mr.  Chairman,  we  object  to  the  poll.  Two- 
thirds  of  this  delegation  are  instructed  for  Wilson.  That  is  the  way 
we  stand.  There  is  no  occasion  for  any  poll. 

MR.  SHERIDAN,  of  Kansas:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  that  the  delegation 
be  polled. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Chair  directs  that  the  Kansas 
delegation  be  polled. 

The  Secretary  polled  the  Kansas  delegation,  with  the  following 
result  :

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  resolution  adopted  in  the  Kansas 
State  Convention  reads  as  follows: 

' '  We  hereby  endorse  the  Hon.  Champ  Clark,  of  Missouri,  the 
Abraham  Lincoln  of  today,  as  our  candidate  for  President  of  the 
United  States;  and 

"Be  it  further  resolved,  That  we  hereby  instruct  the  twenty  dele- 
gates from  Kansas,  elected  today  to  the  Baltimore  Convention,  to  vote 
for  him  as  a  unit  until  two-thirds  of  the  delegation  believe  his  nomina- 
tion to  be  impossible,  and  the  delegates  elected  by  this  State  Convention 
are  further  instructed  that  on  all  other  matters  coming  before  the 
Democratic  Convention  of  1912  they  shall  vote  as  a  unit  as  a  majority 
of  the  said  delegates  may  direct. 

"And  ~be  it  further  resolved,  That  if  it  becomes  evident  that  Mr. 
Clark  cannot  be  nominated,  our  twenty  delegates  shall  vote  for 
Woodrow  Wilson,  as  long  as,  in  the  judgment  of  two-thirds  of  the 
delegates  from  Kansas,  he  h&amp;s  a  chance  for  the  nomination." 

Now  the  vote  in  Kansas  stood,  Clark  6,  Wilson  13.  Under  these 
resolutions,  until  two-thirds  believe  that  Clark  can  not  be  nominated, 
the  whole  20  votes  must  be  cast  for  Clark;  but  when  two-thirds  deter- 
mine that  in  their  judgment  they  are  released  from  instructions  for 
him  because  they  believe  he  can  not  be  nominated,  then  the  whole 
20  votes  go  to  Wilson  under  the  two-thirds  rule  which  they  have  adopted 
here.  Therefore  it  is  the  opinion  of  the  Chair  that  the  20  votes  of 
Kansas,  the  vote  being  Clark  6,  Wilson  13,  absent  1,  should  be  cast 

Mr.  Theodore  A.  Bell,  of  California,  rose. 


294  OFFICIAL  PBOCEEDIXGS  OF  THE 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     The  Chair  will  hear  the  gentleman. 

MR.  J.  W.  ORR,  of  Kansas:  Mr.  Bell  has  not  anything  to  do  with 
this  delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  He  is  a  delegate  to  this  Convention, 
and  has  a  right  to  be  heard. 

MR.  ORR,  of  Kansas:     Not  on  this  matter. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  i'es,  he  has.  The  gentleman  from 
California  [Mr.  Bell]  is  a  delegate  to  this  Convention,  and  is  entitled 
to  be  ieard.  We  are  all  fellow  Democrats.  We  want  to  treat  each 
other  fairly,  and  we  want  to  do  right. 

MB.  ORR,  of  Kansas:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a  point  of  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  What  is  the  gentleman's  point  of 
order. 

MR.  ORR,  of  Kansas:  That  there  is  no  question  before  the  house 
to  be  discussed,  and  nothing  except  the  announcement  of  this  vote. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  But  before  the  Chair  could  say  how 
the  vote  stood,  the  Chair  had  to  rule  upon  these  instructions.  If  not, 
the  vote  would  have  gone  13  for  Wilson;  6  for  Clark,  and  1  absent. 
Do  you  want  it  that  way? 

MR.  ORR,  of  Kansas:    No. 

MR.  THEODORE  A.  BELL,  of  California :  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
of  the  Convention,  I  desire  to  speak 

MR.  THOMAS  H.  BALL,  of  Texas:  Mr.  Chairman,  in  view  of  the 
action  taken  by  the  delegation  from  Kansas,  I  as  a  delegate  from 
Texas  object  to  the  gentleman  from  California  ('Mr.  Bell)  occupying 
our  time. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  California  has 
a  right  to  be  heard  upon  the  point  of  order. 

MR.  WILLIAM  HUGHES,  of  New  Jersey:  Mr.  Chairman,  a  parlia- 
mentary inquiry. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  gentleman  will  state  it. 

MR.  HUGHES,  of  New  Jersey:     What  is  the  pending  question? 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     A  point  of  order. 

MR.  HUGHES,  of  New  Jersey:     Nobody  has  made  a  point  of  order. 

MR.  BELL,  of  California :     I  make  a  point  of  order. 

MR.  HUGHES,  of  New  Jersey:  What  is  the  gentleman's  point  of 
order? 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  My  point  of  order  is  that  the  twenty  votes 
just  polled  for  Wilson  and  for  Clark  must  under  the  instructions  given 
the  Kansas  delegation  be  cast  in  their  entirety,  20  votes  for  Champ 
Clark.  That  is  my  point  of  order. 

MR.  HUGHES,  of  New  Jersey:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  submit  that  the 
gentleman  has  not  stated  a  point  of  order. 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  I  claim  the  right  to  be  heard  upon  this  point  of  order, 
and  I  intend  to  be  heard  if  possible,  because  I  believe  it  to  be  my

DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  295 

right,  as  it  is  the  right  of  any  other  delegate  in  this  Convention  to  be 
heard  upon  this  point  of  order. 

MR.  E.  J.  JUSTICE,  of  North  Carolina:  Mr.  Chairman,  a  point  of 
order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  California  is 
speaking  to  a  point  of  order. 

MR.  JUSTICE,  of  North  Carolina:  The  gentleman  from  California 
has  stated  his  point  of  order,  and  has  no  right  to  occupy  our  time  by 
debating  it. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  point  of  order  of  the  gentleman 
from  North  Carolina  is  overruled. 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  I  intend  to  speak  simply  to  the  one 
question,  as  to  the  construction  of  the  resolution  that  was  adopted  by 
the  Kansas  Convention.  The  Democratic  State  Convention  of  Kansas 
adopted  the  following  resolution: 

"We  hereby  instruct  the  twenty  delegates  from  Kansas,  elected 
today  to  the  Baltimore  Convention,  to  vote  for  him  (Clark)  as  a  unit 
until  two-thirds  of  the  delegates  believe  his  nomination  to  be  impossible; 
and  the  delegates  elected  by  this  State  Convention  are  further  instructed 
that  on  all  other  matters  coming  before  the  Democratic  Convention  of 
1912  they  shall  vote  as  a  unit,  as  a  majority  of  the  said  delegates  may 
direct. ' ' 

They  instructed  that  delegation  to  vote  for  Champ  Clark  for  Presi- 
dent as  long  as  there  were  not  fourteen  votes  in  that  delegation  against 
Champ  Clark. 

MR.  JUSTICE,  of  North  Carolina:  Mr.  Chairman,  may  I  ask  the 
gentleman  from  California  a  question? 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:     I  decline  to  yield. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  gentleman  declines  to  yield. 

MR.  JUSTICE,  of  North  Carolina:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  make  the  point 
that  the  Kansas  delegation  has  by  a  two-thirds  vote  already  left  Clark, 
and  the  Chair  has  ruled  that  they  had  a  right  to  vote  for  Wilson. 
Now  they  cannot  leave  Wilson  without  a  two-thirds  vote  under  that 
resolution. 

MR.  ORR,  of  Kansas:  Everybody  understands  that  fully  as  well 
as  you  do. 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  In  accordance  with  that  resolution,  when 
the  moment  arrived  that  fourteen  men  in  that  delegation  no  longer 
thought  the  nomination  of  Clark  to  be  possible,  they  exercised  their 
right  under  that  resolution  and  voted  that  delegation  as  a  unit  for 
Governor  Wilson. 

Now  let  us  take  up  the  next  resolution. 

"And  be  it  further  resolved  that  if  it  becomes  evident  that  Mr. 
Clark  cannot  be  nominated,  our  twenty  delegates  shall  vote  for  Woodrow 
Wilson,  as  long  as,  in  the  judgment  of  two-thirds  of  the  delegates  from 
Kansas,  he  has  a  chance  for  the  nomination. ' ' 


296  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

There  have  voted  here  thirteen  men  who  in  their  judgment  believe 
that  Wilson  has  a  chance  for  the  nomination;    but  this  resolution  - 
that  as  long  as  in  the  judgment  of  two-thirds,  or  fourteen,  his  nomina- 
tion is  possible,  the  same  rule   that  you  applied  before   should  apply 
to  Wilson. 

I  refer  again  to  the  language  of  this  resolution  that  applies  to 
Governor  Wilson: 

"That  our  twenty  delegates  shall  vote  for  Woodrow  Wilson  as  long 
as  in  the  judgment  of  two-thirds  of  the  delegates  from  Kansas  he  has 
a  chance  for  the  nomination." 

They  must  have  two-thirds  of  those  twenty  delegates  from  Kansas. 
Now  you  have  heard  the  poll  of  that  delegation,  and  only  thirteen  men 
on  that  delegation  have  voted  that  in  their  judgment  Wilson  has  a 
chance  for  the  nomination.  I  make  the  point  of  order  that  at  all  times 
when  you  and  I  and  others  went  to  school,  thirteen  was  not  two-thirds 
of  twenty,  and  it  cannot  be  two-thirds  of  twenty.  [Applause.] 

MB.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman,  1  shall 
occupy  only  a  minute  or  two  of  your  time,  because  I  agree  with  most 
of  you  that  the  way  to  finish  the  business  which  has  brought  us  here 
is  not  to  indulge  in  resolutions  and  speech-making,  but  to  continue 
the  voting  to  the  end.  [Applause.] 

Upon  this  point  of  order  I  desire  to  say  only  this,  that  the  delegates 
from  Kansas  upon  this  floor  at  the  time  of  this  call  were  nineteen  in 
number,  one  delegate  being  absent.  While  Kansas  may  be  entitled  to 
twenty  votes,  she  does  not  have  twenty  votes  at  this  particular  time. 
as  units  of  her  delegation,  and  thirteen  of  the  nineteen  men  present 
having  voted,  thirteen  constitutes  two-thirds  of  the  delegation  from 
Kansas  now  on  the  floor.  [Applause.]  Under  every  precedent  of  the 
House  of  Kepresentatives,  under  whose  rules  we  are  operating,  it  is 
well  settled  that  two  thirds  of  the  members  present  may  pass  a  resolu- 
tion, when  the  rules  call  for  two-thirds,  provided  always  a  quorum 
is  present  at  the  time  the  resolution  is  passed.  [Applause.]  And  I 
submit,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  the  point  of  order  made  by  the  gentleman 
from  California  (Mr.  Bell)  cannot  be  sustained.  [Applause.] 

MR.  BEN  JOHNSON,  of  Kentucky:  Mr.  Chairman,  it  is  almost  impos- 
sible for  us  back  here  to  hear  what  goes  on  upon  the  platform.  When 
the  resolution  was  read,  I  failed  to  hear  whether  or  not  the  Kansas 
delegation  were  instructed,  or  given  the  liberty  to  break  away  from 
their  instructions  when  two-thirds  of  the  delegation  said  so,  or  when 
two-thirds  of  the  delegation  present  said  so.  The  question  therefore 
arises  as  to  whether  it  is  two-thirds  of  the  delegation,  or  whether  it 
is  two-thirds  of  the  delegation  which  is  present. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  resolution  says  "Two-thirds  of 
the  delegates  from  Kansas." 

MR.  GAITSKELL,  of  Kansas:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  after  the  nineteenth  ballot,  on  yesterday,  the  delegates 


7x 


V* 


PKMOCKATIC   \ATIO\AI.  CONVENTION  297 

from  Kansas  had  a  meeting.     Iii  that  meeting  fourteen  of  them  decided 
to  change  the  vote  from  Clark  to  Wilson. 

MR.  CHARLES  X.  BVUJER,  of  New  York:  They  cannot  change  the 
resolution. 

MR.  GAITSKELL,  of  Kansas:  The  chairman  of  the  delegation  at  that 
time  agreed  with  Senator  Martine.  the  manager  of  the  Wilson  forces, 
that  from  that  time  on  a  majority  of  the  Kansas  delegates  should  con- 
trol the  action  of  the  delegates  in  this  Convention.  We  agreed  to  that 
amongst  ourselves,  and  the  Chairman  has  violated  that  agreement.  We 
understand  the  instructions  to  be  that  after  the  fourteen  decided  to 
change  from  Clark  to  Wilson,  it  took  fourteen  votes  to  take  the  delega- 
tion from  Wilson  to  anyone  else.  [Applause.] 

Now  to  go  a  little  further,  there  is  nothing  in  this  resolution  which 
says  this  de'egation  must  go  hack  to  Mr.  Clark  at  any  time.  That  is 
the  condition  so  far  as  Kansas  is  concerned.  We  do  not  desire  to  be 
deprived  of  our  right  to  vote  our  sentiments  in  this  Convention. 

MR.  B.  J.  SHERIDAN,  of  Kansas:  Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  one  man 
absent.  I  hold  that  of  the  nineteen  men  here  each  man  has  a  right  to 
one-nineteenth  of  that  absent  vote,  and  that  would  give  two-thirds  of  the 
vote  to  Wilson.  That  would  give  more  than  thirteen,  and  more  than 
two-thirds  of  the  twenty. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  is  ready  to  rule.  This  Con- 
vention has  adopted  the  rules  of  the  62d  Congress  for  its  government. 
The  point  of  order  is  made  by  the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr. 
Bell]  that  the  two-thirds  spoken  of  in  the  resolution,  which  says  "two- 
thirds  of  the  delegates  from  Kansas,"  means  two-thirds  of  the  entire 
twenty,  and  that  before  they  can  vote  the  entire  twenty  they  must  have 
fourteen;  but  the  gentleman  is  wrong,  for  this  reason:  The  Constitu- 
tion of  the  United  States  says  that  in  order  to  pass  a  bill  over  the  veto 
of  the  President,  two  thirds  must  agree  to  pass  it,  the  veto  of  the  Presi- 
dent to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  and  that  when  two-thirds  of  one 
house  shall  agree  to  pass  the  bill,  it  shall  be  sent  to  the  other  body. 

Now  the  words  are  used  "two-thirds  of  the  House"  just  as  the 
words  are  used  which  apply  to  this  delegation.  The  holding  upon  that 
constitutional  provision  has  been  uniformly  that  if  two-thirds  of  the 
House  to  which  the  bill  is  returned  witli  the  objections  of  the  President 
shall  agree  to  pass  it,  and  then  two-thirds  of  the  other  house  agree  to 
pass  it.  it  becomes  a  law;  but  the  holding  is  that  it  is  two-thirds  of 
those  voting,  and  not  two-thirds  of  those  elected  to  Congress.  [Ap- 
plause.] The  same  ruling  has  been  uniformly  made  in  regard  to  con- 
stitutional amendments.  The  law  provides  that  a  constitutional  amend- 
ment must  get  two-thirds  of  the  vote  of  the  House.  The  amendment 
submitted  for  an  income  tax,  and  the  amendment  submitted  for  the  elec- 
tion of  Senators  by  direct  vote  of  the  people,  have  been  passed  by  the 
te  of  two-thirds  of  those  voting,  and  not  two-thirds  of  those  elected. 


298  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Therefore  the  point  is  overruled,  and  the  twenty  votes  of  Kansas  are 
directed  to  be  cast  for  Wilson.     [Applause.]

of  States,  etc.,  the  result  was  announced — Clark  468*,  Wilson  436,  Under-

vening on  June  25,  1912,  be  and  they  are  hereby  instructed  to  vote 
in  said  Convention  for  the  Hon.  Champ  Clark  for  the  nomination  for 
President  so  long  as  a  majority  of  all  delegates  from  this  State  believe 
his  nomination  can  be  accomplished,  after  which  time  they  shall  vote 
for  such  candidate  in  said  Convention  as  a  majority  of  all  of  said 
delegates  from  this  State  shall  determine. ' '

absent  1,  under  the  unit  rule  applying  to  West  Virginia  the  entire 
vote  of  the  State  is  cast  for  Champ  Clark.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  P.  J.  QUEALEY,  of  Wyoming  (when  the  State  of  Wyoming  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  the  State  of  Wyoming,  acting  under  the  instruc- 
tions of  the  State  Convention,  having  voted  under  the  unit  rule,  and

President  as  long  as  there  was  a  chance  for  his  nomination,  and  a 
majority  of  the  delegates  having  now  changed  their  vote,  I  desire  to 
announce  that  the  six  votes  of  Wyoming  are  cast  for  Wilson  for

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Xo  one  having  received  the  requisite 
two-thirds,  the  Secretary  will  again  call  the  roll. 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  BRYAN,  of  Xebraska:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  a 
question  of  privilege. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Nebraska  will 
state  his  question  of  privilege.  The  rule  under  which  we  operate  here 
is  the  rule  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  which  is  as  follows : 

"Questions  of  privilege  shall  be,  first  those  affecting  the  rights  of  the 
House  collectively,  its  safety,  dignity,  and  the  integrity  of  its  proceed- 
ings; second,  the  rights,  reputation  and  dignity  of  its  members  indi- 
vidually in  their  representative  capacity  only." 


310  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

The  genrleivan  from  Nebraska  will  state  his  question  of  privilege, 
ar.cl  then  the  Cliair  will  decide  whether  or  not  he  has  a  right  to  speak 
upon  thai-  question. 

MR.  JOHN  F.  FITZGERALD,  of  Massachusetts:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to 
a  point  of  order.  • 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Massachusetts 
will  state  his  point  of  order. 

MR.  FITZGERALD,  of  Massachusetts:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  other  even- 
ing when  Massachusetts  came  to  vote  I  asked  unanimous  consent — 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  If  the  gentleman  had  risen  to  a  ques 
tion  of  personal  privilege,  he  would  have  been  recognized. 

MR.  FITZGERALD,  of  Massachusetts:  I  asked  for  unanimous  consent 
to  make  a  statement  as  to  the  reason  why  Massachusetts  changed  its 
vote,  and  there  w?s  objection.  I  then  rcse  to  a  question  of  personal 
privilege,  and  the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  Sulzer)  who  was  iu 
the  Chair  at  that  time,  declared  me  out  of  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  will  say  that  he  has  con- 
sulted with  Judge  Crisp,  the  parliamentarian  not  only  of  th!s  Conven 
tion  but  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  and  he  inforn-s  the  Chair  that 
he  knew  of  no  such  request;  but  the  Chair  will  say  to  the  gentleman  that 
if  the  present  occupant  of  the  chair  had  been  in  the  chair  he  would  have 
recognized  the  gentleman  from  Massachusetts  if  the  gentleman  from 
Massachusetts  rcse  to  a  question  of  personal  privilege.  And  if  the  gen 
t!eman  will  r'se  to  such  a  question  after  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska 
(Mr.  Bryan)  has  stated  his  question  of  personal  privilege,  the  Chair  will 
gladly  recognize  him.  [Applause.] 

MR.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  was  seated  with  my 
delegation  when  a  banner  with  a  certain  inscription  upon  it  was  brought 
and  placed  in  front  of  us.  I  asked  those  in  charge  of  it  to  remove  it 
from  that  place.  When  they  refused  I  went  to  the  Missouri  delegation 
and  inquired  for  the  chairman  of  that  delegation,  to  see  whether  that 
had  been  done  at  his  request.  If  that  was  the  unauthorized  act  of  those 
who  brought  it  there,  I  have  nothing  to  say;  but  if  Missouri's  delega- 
tion is  responsible  for  it,  I  claim  the  right  to  answer  the  question  which 
they  thus  present. 

MR.  JAMES  A.  REED,  of  Missouri:  I  submit  that  is  not  a  question 
of  privilege. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  regrets  to  be  compelled  to 
rule  that  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  does  not  state  a  question  of 
personal  privilege.  The  gentleman  from  Massachusetts  (Mr.  Fitzgerald) 
is  now  recognized. 

MR.  FITZGERALD,  of  Massachusetts:  Mr. 'Chairman.  I  desire  to  thank 
(he  Chair  for  h's  courtesy  in  offering  me  the  floor  at  this  time,  to  take 
the  floor  upon  a  question  of  personal  privilege. 


I 

DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  311 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  gentleman  will  state  it. 

MR.  FITZGERALD,  of  Massachusetts:  I  do  not  wish  to  delay  the  delib- 
erations of  the  Convention  at  this  time,  and  therefore  will  not  take 
advantage  of  the  opportunity  afforded  me  by  the  Chair,  but  will  serve 
notice  on  the  Chair  that  when  the  time  arrives  when  this  Convention  finds 
itself  unable  to  make  a  choice  between  the  three  leading  candidates,  I 
shall  ask  the  Convention  for  unanimous  consent  to  place  in  nomination 
that  peerless  son  of  old  Massachusetts,  Eugene  Noble  Foss.  [Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for 
the  thirty-fourth  ballot.  .

MR.  FRANK  L.  MA  YES,  of  Florida:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  challenge  the

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of  the

DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  319 

MR.  ALBERT  W.  GILCHRIST,  of  Florida:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  wish  to 
make  the  following  statement :  In  the  State  of  Florida  we  had  a 
primary  election.  There  are  three  Congressional  districts  in  Florida. 
Every  one  of  them  went  for  Underwood  by  a  safe  majority.  The 
State  of  Florida  went  for  Underwood  by  fully  8,000  majority.  In  every 
Congressional  district  there  were  candidates  for  delegates  to  this  Con- 
vention, some  of  them  announcing  that  they  were  in  favor  of  Wilson 
and  some  of  them  in  favor  of  Underwood;  but  before  any  gentleman 
could  get  his  name  on  the  ticket  he  had  to  sign  the  following  pledge: 

"I  do  hereby  pledge  my  honor  to  abide  by  the  result  of  this 
primary. ' ' 

Here  now  is  a  rule  which  has  been  substantially  agreed  upon  as 
governing  this  primary: 

' '  The  candidate  for  the  nomination  for  President  receiving  a  major- 
ity of  the  votes  cast  shall  be  the  first  choice  of  the  Democratic  party  of 
Florida,  and  the  delegates  elected  are  instructed  to  vote  for  such  as 
their  first  choice."  . 

Now  we  come  to  this  question:  In  one  district  two  gentlemen 
received  more  votes  than  their  opponents.  In  that  district,  however, 
Mr.  Underwood  received  a  good,  unquestioned  majority  over  Mr.  Wilson. 
The  question  now  is,  when  shall  any  one  of  these  gentlemen  be  allowed 
to  'change  his  vote?  Will  the  majority  decide  it,  or  are  individual 
delegates  to  decide  it?  That  is  the  question  as  I  understand  it. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Under  the  ruling  of  the  Permanent 
Chairman  in  a  similar  case 

MR.  FRANK  L.  MAYES,  of  Florida :  Mr.  Chairman,  one  moment, 
please,  before  the  ruling  is  made.  I  should  like  to  say  something. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  This  is  not  an  open  or  a  disputed  question. 
The  Permanent  Chairman  (Mr.  James,  of  Kentucky)  in  a  similar  matter 
determined,  and  I  concur  in  his  ruling,  that  under  the  circumstances 
disclosed  in  the  Florida  ease,  the  delegates  in  this  Convention  are  at 
liberty  to  vote  as  they  please.  [Applause.] 

MR.  EGBERT  E.  DAVIS,  of  Florida:  I  ask  for  the  privilege  of  the 
floor.  One  of  the  propositions  involved  here  has  not  yet  been  stated  to 
the  Chair.  I  think  that  has  tended  to  confuse  the  Chair. 

The  holding  of  the  primary  election  in  Florida  was  ordered  by  the 
State  Executive  Committee,  and  under  that  call  it  was  likewise  ordered 
that  the  delegates  to  this  Convention  should  be  bound  by  the  result  at 
the  polls  in  that  primary. 

MR.  J.  F.  C.  GRIGGS,  of  Florida:     Mr.  Chairman,  a  point  of  order. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  :  The  gentleman  will  state  the  point  of  order. 

MR.  DAVIS,  of  Florida.  Under  the  pledge  taken  by  the  delegates 
tlipy  were  bound  to  vote  for  the  nominee  as  declared  by  the  Florida 
primary,  and  that  was  without  qualification  or  limitation.  From  the 
decision  of  the  Chair  I  respectfully  appeal  to  this  Convention. 


3.20  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  EMMETT  O'NEAL,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  for  the 
reading  of  the  call  for  the  State  primary  of  Florida.  . 

MR.  GRIGGS,  of  Florida:  Mr.  Chairman,  being  one  of  the  delegates 
most  interested  in  this  decision,  I  rise  to  the  point  of  order  that  the 
gentleman  (Mr.  Davis)  is  speaking  upon  a  question  that  has  already 
been  decided  by  the  Chair. 

MR.  DAVIS,  of  Florida:  I  am  speaking  upon  an  appeal  from  the 
decision  of  the  Chair  to  this  Convention,  backed  by  a  majority  of  a 
thousand  votes  from  Florida  for  Oscar  W.  Underwood,  which  binds  this 
gentleman  as  well  as  myself,  as  long  as  Mr.  Underwood's  name  is 
before  the  Convention. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  Chair  wishes  to  announce  that  in  the 
decision  just  made  the  Chair  has  followed  the  precedent  of  the  decision 
of  the  Permanent  Chairman  of  this  Convention,  and  that  Mr.  James 
adheres  to  the  decision  announced  a  short  time  ago,  that  every  delegate 
in  the  Florida  delegation  is  at  liberty  to  vote  according  to  his  own 
conscience.  [Applause.] 

MR.  EMMETT  O'NEAL,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  for  the 
reading  of  the  call. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  :  In  accordance  with  this  ruling  the  vote  of 
the  Florida  delegation  will  be  recorded  Underwood  10,  Wilson  2. 

The  Secretary  having  resumed  and  concluded  the  roll  of  States,  etc., 
the  result  was  announced :  Clark  425,  Wilson  498i,  Underwood  106,  Foss 
28,  Harmon  29,  Kern  1,  not  voting  ^,  as  follows:

322  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

\ 

THIKTY-NINTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll  of  States. 

The  State  of  Colorado  was  called  and  the  result  was  announced: 
Clark  11,  Wilson  1. 

MR.  C.  P.  MALTBY,  of  Colorado:  Mr.  Chairman — 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  For  what  purpose  does  the  gentleman 
rise  ? 

MR.  MALTBY,  of  Colorado :   A  point  of  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Colorado  will 
state  it. 

MR.  MALTBY,  of  Colorado:  In  the  first  place,  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Clark 
carried  every  county  in  the  State  of  Colorado  except  one,  and  when  we 
met  at  Colorado  Springs  the  State  Convention  passed  resolutions  instruct- 
ing the  delegates  to  vote  for  Mr.  Clark  until  we  were  released  by  him  or 
by  his  authority,  and  Mr.  Ferris  has  no  right  to  violate  the  instructions  of 
the  State  Convention. 

MR.  CHARLES  F.  TEW,  of  Colorado:  Mr.  Chairman,  under  the  Colorado 
instructions  there  is  no  unit  rule. 

THE  PERMANENT  CIIAIMAX:  Just  a  moment.  The  Chair  will  look  at 
the  instructions  and  see.  The  resolution  adopted  by  the  Colorado  Con- 
vention reads  as  follows: 

"Be  it  resolved,  That  the  Democratic  party  of  Colorado  in  State 
Convention  assembled  hereby  instructs  its  delegates  to  the  National  Con- 
vention at  Baltimore  to  vote  for  Hon.  Champ  Clark  as  the  nominee  of 
the  Democratic  party  at  that  Convention  for  the  office  of  President  of 
the  United  States,  and  to  use  all  honorable  means  to  secure  his  nomina- 
tion until  released  by  Champ  Clark  or  by  his  authority."  [Applause.] 

MR.  TEW,  of  Colorado:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  wish  to  be  heard  as  to  our 
position.  I  did  not  cast  my  vote  for  Mr.  Wilson.  I  am  here  casting 
my  vote  for  Champ  Clark,  but  that  does  not  make  any  difference.  The 
Colorado  State  Convention  instructed  the  twelve  delegates  from  Colorado 
to  cast  their  ballots  for  Champ  Clark,  but  not  as  a  unit;  there  is  no 
unit  rule.  I  have  no  right  to  cast  the  ballot  of  Mr.  Ferris,  who  desires 
to  vote  for  Mr.  Wilson.  I  maintain  that  each  and  every  man  has  the 
right  to  cast  his  ballot  as  he  sees  fit,  and  then  to  reckon  with  his  con- 
stituency which  sent  him  here.  [Applause.] 

Mr.  Chairman,  so  far  as  I  am  concerned  I  maintain  that  it  is  the 
right  of  every  delegate  among  these  twelve,  when  he  has  obeyed  the 
command  of  his  people,  to  see  to  it  at  the  proper  time  that  the  Demo- 
cratic party  shall  nominate  a  candidate  in  this  Convention  who  will  lead 
it  to  success  in  November;  and  therefore  I  say  that  without  a  unit  rule 
there  can  be  no  restrictions  upon  any  delegate,  except  his  reckoning  with 
those  who  sent  him  here  as  a  delegate  to  this  Convention. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN-  :  The  Chair  will  hold  that  under  the  word- 
ing of  this  resolution  there  is  no  instruction  to  the  delegates  to  vote  as 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENT  i  ox  323 

a  unit.  It  does  direct  them  to  vote  for  Clark  until  released  by  him.  or 
by  someone  in  authority;  but  no  unit  provision  being  in  the  resolution. 
the  individual  delegates  will  be  responsible  to  their  constituents,  an;] 
the  Cliair  so  holds. 

The  Secretary  having  resumed  and  concluded  the  calling  of  the  roll  of 
States,  etc.,  the  result  was  announced:  Clark  422,  Wilson  501^,  Under- 
wood 100,  Foss  28.  Harmon  29,  Kern  1,  not  voting  i,  as  follows:

PRAYER  OF  REV.  GEORGE  R.  GROSE. 

Rev.  George  R.  Grose,  psstor  of  Grace  Methodist  Episcopal  Church, 
Baltimore;  Md.,  offered  the  following  prayer: 

Almighty  God,  our  heavenly  Father,  Whose  kingdom  is  everlasting 
and  power  infinite,  Who  rules  and  governs  all  things,  world  without 
end;  the  earth  is  Thine  and  the  fullness  thereof,  the  world  and  they 
that  dwell  therein. 

We,  Thy  humble  servants,  invoke  Thy  blessing.  Grant  Thy  favor,  we 
beseech  Thee,  upon  this  National  Convention  assembled.  Give  Thy  guid- 
ance to  these  delegates  who  have  been  charged  with  heavy  responsibilities 
by  their  fellow-citizens.  Through  their  deliberations  may  there  be  set 
before  the  whole  nation  the  highest  ideals  of  citizenship  and  public 
duty.  May  the  counsels  of  sound  judgment,  of  unselfish  purpose,  of 
loyal  conviction  and  true  patriotism  prevail.  Let  us  never  forget  in  the 
excitement  of  any  moment,  or  under  the  pressure  of  any  circumstance, 
that  we  are  brethren  and  One  is  our  Master,  even  Christ.  Let  us  never 
forget  Whose  we  are  and  how  great  a  cause  we  serve.  May  the  people 
of  this  nation  be  established  in  truth  and  in  integrity,  in  peace  and  in 
righteousness.  May  the  consciences  of  all  our  citizens  be  so  quickened 
that  every  evil  thing  may  be  put  down,  and  that  all  that  makes  for  honor 
and  temperance  and  true  religion  may  grow  from  more  to  more. 

Graciously  bless  Thy  servants,  the  President  of  the  United  States, 
.the  members  of  Congress,  and  the  Governor  of  the  Commonwealth,  and 
may  all  who  are  over  us  in  the  State  and  in  the  Nation  look  upon  them- 
selves as  the  ministers  of  God,  from  Whom  cometh  all  power  and 
authority,  and  Who  hath  ordained  all  government.  May  we,  and  all 
the  people,  duly  considering  Whose  authority  they  bear,  faithfully  and 
obediently  honor  Thee  in  honoring  them.  May  we  all  so  walk  in  Thy 
ways,  and  keep  Thy  commandments  that  being  always  under  Thy  care 
51  ml  fatherly  protection  we  may  evermore  be  that  happy  people  whose 
God  is  the  Lord.

FORTY-THIRD  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

The  State  of  Kentucky  was  called  and  the  vote  announced:  Clark  20. 

MR.  ALLIE  W.  YOUNG,  of  Kentucky:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Kentucky 
delegation  desire  to  know  whether  under  our  instructions,  with  which  the 
Chairman  is  familiar,  we  have  a  right  to  cast  Kentucky's  vote  for  Wil- 
son if  a  majority  of  the  delegation  so  desire?  We  would  like  to  h*i-c 
that  information. 

MR.  JAMES  B.  McC'REARY,  of  Kentucky:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Kentucky 
Democratic  State  Convention  adopted-  the  unit  rule  arid  instructed  the 
delegates  to  vote  for  Champ  Clark  as  long  as  his  name  was  before  the 
Convention.  .  I  have  here  the  instructions,  which  I  will  read,  adopted 
by  a  unanimous  vote  in  the  Kentucky  State  Convention  May  29,  1912. 

"The  delegates  at  large,  selected  by  this  Convention,  and  the  dele- 
gates from  each  and  every  Congressional  District  of  Kentucky  are  in- 
structed to  cast  their  votes  as  a  unit  in  the  apj  Touching  Baltimore  Con- 
vention, and  for  the  nomination  of  Honorable  Champ  Clark  for  Pros;  'eni 
as  long  as  his  name  shall  be  before  that  Convention,  and  to  use  all  hon- 
orable effort  to  secure  his  nomination." 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  holcl  that  under  the  mstmotiors  of  the  State  Demo- 
cratic Convention  of  Kentucky  it  is  our  duty  to  cast  the  whole  26  vote? 
for  Clark. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  will  state  to  the  gentleman 
who  has  propounded  the  parliamentary  inquiry  that  if  he  demands  a  poll 
of  the  delegation  the  Chair  will  very  gladly  order  it,  and  if  a  majority 
of  the  delegation  upon  that  poll  vote  for  some  other  candidate  than  the 
one  the  Kentucky  Democracy  instructed  them  to  vote  for,  the  Chair  wi!i 
pass  upon  that  question  at  that  time. 

MR.  YOUNG,  of  Kentucky:  Mr.  Chairman,  we  have  been  hero  too 
long  a  time  now.  We  went  to  get  away. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Docs  the  gentleman  demand  a  poll? 

MR.  YOUNG,  of  Kentucky:  No,  I  ask  that  Kentucky  be  passed  for 
the  present. 

THE  PER. \IAXKXT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chaiimun  of  the  Kentucky  dele-

DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  335 

speaks  for  the  delegates.  If  any  member  of  that  delegation  wants  a 
poll  and  demands  it,  the  Chair  will  order  it. 

MR.  YOUNG,  of  Kentucky:  I  understand  that. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  If  no  poll  is  demanded,  the  vote  of 
Kentucky  will  be  recorded  as  announced  by  the  Chairman  of  that 
delegation. 

The  State  of  Maryland  was  called  and  requested  to  be  passed  tem- 
porarily. 

The  State  of  Texas  was  called. 

.Mi:.  F.  C.  DAVIS,  of  Georgia:  I  move  that  we  make  the  nomination 
of  Mr.  Wilson  unanimous. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  That  motion  is  not  in  order.  The 
Secretary  will  proceed  with  the  roll-call  of  States. 

The   Secretary  proceeded   with   the   roll-call   of   States. 

MR.  CLAUDE  A.  SWANSON.  of  Virginia  (when  the  State  of  Virginia 
was  called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Virginia  delegation  came  to  this  Con- 
vention uuinstructed  and  imtrammeled.  The  State  Convention  adopted 
no  unit  rule.  Up  to  this  time  each  member  of  the  Virginia  delegation 
has  been  voting  his  preference  and  convictions  in  this  matter.  This 
morning  the  Virginia  delegation  met,  and  considering  the  emergency 
that  has  arisen,  decided  that  the  time  had  come  to  apply  the  unit  rule 
to  the  delegation.  After  discussion  of  the  conditions  in  this  Convention 
the  Virginia  delegation  directs  me  to  cast  24  solid  votes  for  Wilson. 
[Applause.] 

The  roll-call  was  concluded. 

The   State  of  Maryland  was  again   called. 

MR.  JOHN  WALTER  SMITH,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman,  Maryland 
asks  that  the  roll  of  her  delegation  be  called. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of 
the  Maryland  delegation. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll  of  the  ^Maryland  delegation. 

MR.  JOHN  S.  YOUNG,  of  Maryland  (when  the  name  of  Emory  L. 
Coblentz  was  called)  :  Mr.  Chairman.  I  want  to  cast  the  vote  of  Emory 
L.  Coblentz  for  Wilson.  Mr.  Coblentz  is  absent,  but  has  authorized  me 
to  cast  his  vote  for  Wilson. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Ho  cannot  vote  unless  he  is  here.  No 
proxies  can  be  voted,  as  the  Chair  has  held  several  times,  but  if  Mr. 
Coblentz 's  alternate  is  here  he  can  vote. 

MR.  YouNG,  of  Maryland:  We  have  been  permitting  that  in  our 
delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  If  the  alternate  is  present  he  can  vote. 
but  the  Chair  ruled  in  the  ease  of  the  Nebraska  delegation  that  no 
proxies  could  be  voted. 

The  Secretary  resumed  and  concluded  the  roll  call  of  the  Maryland 
delegation.  The  result  was  as  follows:

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  No  candidate  having  received  the 
necessary  two-thirds,  the  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  the  forty-fourth 
ballot. 

FORTY-FOURTH    BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll  of  States. 

MR.  HOWARD  HATHAWAY,  of  Washington  (Proxy  for  J.  D.  Bird, 
when  the  State  of  Washington  was  called)  :  Mr.  Chairman  — 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  For  what  purpose  does  the  gentleman 
rise? 

MR.  HATHAWAY,  of  Washington:  The  State  of  Washington  desires 
a  roll  carl. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of  the 
Washington  delegation. 

MR.  WILL  H.  MERRITT,  of  Washington :     Mr.  Chairman,  by  passing  * 
a   book   around  and   having   it   signed   a   poll   was   taken   two   or   three 
minutes  ago  and  it  stands  10  to  4  in  favor  of  Clark.     There  are  some 
gentlemen  here  who   desire  to  get  their  pictures  in  the  papers,  to  be 
circulated,  and  if  they  want  a  public  roll  call  they  can  have  it. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  A  roll  call  being  demanded  the 
Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of  the  Washington  delegation. 

The  name  of  M.  M.  Lyter  was  called,  and  Mr.  Walter  Ronald  voted 
in  his  stead. 

MR.  CHARLES  URURY,  of  Washington:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  object  to 
Mr.  Ronald  voting  twice.  He  claims  to  hold  a  proxy  for  Mr.  Lyter 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  339 

and  also  for  Mr.   Shram.     I  object  to  the  recognition  of  proxies  here 
unless  they  are  written  proxies,  with  the  signatures  of  the  delegates. 

MR.  RONALD,  of  Washington:  I  have  a  written  proxy  under  his 
signature. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Chair  has  held  that  no  proxy  can 
be  voted. 

MR.  GEORGE  TURNER,  of  Washington:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Washington 
delegation  has  no  alternates.  Our  delegation  has  been  recognizing 
proxies  throughout  this  Convention.  When  a  gentleman  leaves  the  hall, 
he  leaves  his  proxy  witli  a  member  of  the  delegation.  That  course  has 
been  pursued  from  the  beginning  of  the  Convention.  The  very  gentleman 
who  makes  this  objection  has  been  here  from  the  beginning  on  a  proxy, 
and  I  respectfully  insist  that  the  ruling  of  the  Chair  with  reference 
to  States  which  have  alternates  ought  not  to  be  applied  to  a  delegation 
like  that  of  the  State  of  Washington,  which  is  here  without  any 
alternates. 

MR.  J.  W.  BLACK,  of  Washington :  Mr.  Chairman,  while  Senator 
Turner  is  not  voting  the  way  I  do,  I  w,ant  to  say  in  the  interest  of 
fairness  that  the  Senator  is  fight.  We  have  been  recognizing  proxies 
all  the  way  through. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  has  held  several  times 
upon  other  roll  calls  that  a  proxy  cannot  be  recognized,  if  the  fact  is 
brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Chair.  The  delegates  may  make  such 
agreements  as  they  chose.  So  long  as  the  attention  of  the  Chair  is  not 
called  to  them,  the  Chair  has  nothing  to  do  with  them.  If  your  State 
has  no  alternates,  that  is  the  misfortune  of  the  State,  but  the  delegation 
has  no  right  to  create  alternates,  because  the  body  creating  the  delegates 
alone  has  that  power.  Unless  they  delegate  that  power  to  the  State 
delegation,  then  it  cannot  create  alternates.  You  can  easily  see  the 
difficulty  that  will  arise.  Many  proxies  might  be  presented  issued  by 
the  same  delegate  at  different  times,  depending  upon  his  frame  of  mind 
at  the  time.  We  would  have  inextricable  confusion.  Therefore  the 
Chair  must  hold  that  no  one  but  a  delegate  or  an  alternate  has  the  right 
to  vote. 

MR.  TCRNER,  of  Washington:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  protest  against  the 
ruling,  as  a  part  of  the  fraud  which  has  been  practiced  in  this  Conven 
tion  upon  Champ  Clark. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Without  the  pretext  of  fraud,  or 
statement  unjustified  by  the  facts,  the  gentleman  has  his  remedy  by 
appealing  from  the  decision  of  the  Chair  to  the  Convention  itself,  and 
the  Chair  now  invites  him  to  take  that  appeal. 

MR.  TURNER,  of  Washington:  I  do  appeal  from  the  decision  of  the 
Chair. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  Washington 
appeals  from  the  decision  of  the  Chair.  The  question  is,  shf\l&gt;  the 
decision  of  the  Chair  stand  as  the  judgment  of  the  Convention. 


340  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

MR.  ROBERT  L.  HENRY,  of  Texas:  I  move  to  lay  the  appeal  on  the 
table. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  is -on  the  motion  of  the 
gentleman  from  Texas  to  lay  on  the  table  the  appeal  of  the  gentlemafi 
from  Washington. 

MR.  JOHN  W.  COUGHLIN,  of  Massachusetts:  I  second  the  motion  to 
lay  the  appeal  on  the  table. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

MB.  TURNER,  of  Washington:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  merely  want  to  make 
an  explanation.  The  Washington  delegation  is  under  the  unit  rule. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  knows  it  is.  In  the  State 
of  Washington  the  following  resolution  was  passed. 

"Be  it  resolved  ~by  the  Democratic  Convention  of  the  State  of 
Washington,  That  our  delegates  to  the  National  Convention  at  Baltimore 
are  hereby  instructed  to  vote  as  a  unit  on  all  matters  pertaining  to 
business  coming  before  said  Convention." 

The  Secretary  having  resumed  and  concluded  the  poll  of  the  Wash- 
ington delegation,  the  result  was  announced  as  follows:

FOKTY-FIFTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll  of  States,  etc. 

MR.  JOHN  D.  W.  VEEDER  (when  the  State  of  New  Mexico  was  called)  : 
Mr.  Chairman,  I  demand  a  roll-call  of  the  New  Mexico  delegation. 

The  Secretary  called  the  roll  of  the  New  Mexico  delegation. 

When  the  name  of  J.  H.  Hand  was  called  as  alternate  for  Felix 
Martinez — 

MR.  VEEDER,  of  New  Mexico:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  challenge  the  vote 
cast  by  Mr.  Hand,  because  he  is  not  a  member  of  this  delegation.  Mr. 
Martinez  is  not  here,  and  Mr.  Hand  has  no  proxy  from  him. 

MR.  J.  D.  HAND,  of  New  Mexico :  I  am  a  duly  elected  alternate 
from  New  Mexico. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Secretary  informs  the  Chair  that 
J.  D.  Hand  is  a  duly  elected  alternate. 

MR.  J.  D.  HAND,  of  New  Mexico:     Yes,  sir. 

MR.  VEEDER,  of  New  Mexico:  Mr.  Hand  is  my  alternate,  but  I  am 
here  as  the  principal. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  Mr.  J.  D.  Hand  is  entitled  to  vote 
in  the  first  vacancy  caused  by  the  absence  of  any  delegate,  acting  as 
alternate  for  that  delegate. 

The  Secretary  resumed  and  concluded  the  roll-call  of  the  New  Mexico 
delegation,  with  the  following  result : 

NEW  MEXICO. 
DELEGATES —  »  Clark.  Wilson. 

1— J.  E.  Hartman   1 

2— A.  B.  McCaffey 1 

3 — Felix  Martinez  (by  J.  D.  Hand,  alternate) 1 

4— John  D.  W.  Veeder 1 

5— John   I.   Hinkle    1 

6 — J.   A.   Mahoney    1 

7— T.   W.   Medley    1 

8 — Howard    L.    Bickley    1 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  following  resolution  was  adopted 
in  the  State  of  New  Mexico: 

' '  That  we  hereby  endorse  the  Hon.  Champ  Clark,  of  Missouri,  as 
candidate  for  President  of  the  United  States,  and  we  hereby  instruct 
our  delegates  to  the  Baltimore  Convention  to  use  all  of  their  influence 
and  every  effort  in  their  power  to  secure  the  nomination  of  Hon.  Champ 
Clark  for  President  on  every  ballot  on  which  his  name  is  before  the 
Convention,  or  until,  in  the  opinion  of  a  majority  of  such  delegation, 
his  nomination  can  no  longer  be  reasonably  hoped  for. ' ' 

The  poll  of-  the  delegation  shows,  Wilson  4,  Clark  4.  Therefore,  a 
majority  not  voting  that  his  nomination  can  no  longer  be  reasonably 
hoped  for,  the  entire  vote  of  the  State  is  cast  for  Champ  Clark.

roll  of  States,  etc.,  the  result  was  announced:  Clark  306,  Wilson  633,

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  No  candidate  having  received  the

ballot. 

FORTY-SIXTH  BALLOT. 

The  Secretary  called  the  State  of  Alabama,  and  the  vote  of  that 
State  was  announced,  Underwood  24. 

MB.  JOHN  H.  BANKHEAD,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  unani- 
mous consent  to  vacate  the  order  for  the  roll-call  which  has  just  been 
begun,  in  order  that  I  may  make  a  statement. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  Senator 
Bankhead,  of  Alabama,  asks  unanimous  consent  to  vacate  the  order  for 
the  roll-call  which  has  just  begun,  in  order  that  he  may  make  a  state- 
ment. Is  there  objection  f 

There  was  no  objection. 

MR.  JOHN  H.  BANKHEAD.  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentle- 
men of  the  Convention,  Mr.  Underwood  entered  this  contest  hoping  that 
he  might  secure  the  nomination  at  the  hands  of  this  Convention;  but  I 
desire  to  say  for  him  that  his  first  and  greatest  hope  was  that  through 
this  movement  he  might  be  able  to  eliminate  and  eradicate  for  all  time 
any  remaining  vestige  of  sectional  feeling  in  this  country.  [Applause.] 


346  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Mr.  Underwood  will  today  willingly,  gladly  forego  this  nomination 
if  he  can  feel  that  he  has  succeeded  in  doing  this,  and  that  the  country 
has  concluded  that  Mason  &amp;  Dixon's  line  has  been  stamped  out,  and 
this  is  once  move  a  united  country.  [Applause.]  We  have  demonstrated 
here,  my  friends,*in  my  judgment,  that  sectional  feeling  no  longer  exists. 
The  liberal  support  that  Mr.  Underwood  has  received  from  the  East 
satisfies  us  that  if  an  opportunity  were  offered  to  that  section  to 
nominate  this  splendid  man,  it  would  be  ready,  and  would  hasten  to  his 
aid.  [Applause.] 

Mr.  Underwood  did  not  enter  this  contest  to  defeat  any  man's  nom- 
ination. He  will  not  be  a  party  to  the  defeat  of  any  candidate  before 
this  Convention.  [Applause.]  His  belief  is  that  under  his  leadership 
in  the  House  of  Representatives  those  things  have  been  achieved  which 
will  secure  the  election  of  a  Democrat  in  the  next  November  election. 
[Applause.]  He  has  always  said,  ' '  I  shall  take  no  personal  part  in 
this  campaign.  I  have  not  the  time.  I  have  a  full  man's  work  marked 
out  for  me  in  Washington,  and  my  first  duty  is  to  make  it  possible  to 
elect  a  Democrat,  whoever  the  nominee  may  be."  [Applause.] 

Upon  that  high  ground  he  stands  today.  Upon  that  high  ground  he 
will  stand  tomorrow  and  on  all  other  days.  He  has  no  concern,  my 
friends,  about  his  own  nomination  or  election,  beyond  that  which 
naturally  comes  to  every  man  who  feels  that  he  is  thoroughly  equipped 
and  qualified  for  that  high  office. 

But  I  think  the  time  has  come  when  it  is  demonstrated  that  he 
cannot  be  nominated  in  this  Convention;  and  he  shall  not  be  used  to 
defeat  the  nomination  of  any  other  candidate.  [Applause.]  He  and 
his  friends  everywhere  stand  ready  to  give  the  nominee  of  this  Conven- 
tion their  hearty  support.  He  has  stood  upon  every  platform  that  has 
been  written  since  1896.  He  will  stand  upon  any  platform  that  this 
Convention  may  write.  Knowing  him  as  I  do  I  will  not  undertake  to 
say  that  all  of  its  planks — and  I  do  not  know  what  they  are — will 
entirely  meet  his  judgment;  but  he  is  a  Democrat,  and  stands  for  the 
success  of  his  party.  [Applause.] 

A  DELEGATE:     Nominate  him  for  Vice-President. 

MR.  BANKHEAD,  of  Alabama:  Vice-President,  no!  No  friend  of 
the  Democratic  party  ought  to  suggest  taking  that  man  from  his  present 
post  [applause],  if  he  is  not  to  be  elevated  to  the  highest  office  in  the 
land.  Vice-President !  Anybody  can  sit  in  the  vice-presidential  chair. 
He  is  only  a  kind  of  an  ornament.  Even  I,  humble  as  I  am,  could  sit 
in  that  chair  and  say,  "The  Senator  from  New  York  moves  to  adjourn." 
This  great  man,  the  Democracy's  best  asset,  this  great  Democrat  who 
has  made  it  possible  for  our  party  to  win  in  the  next  contest,  will  stay 
where  he  is  and  perform  the  duties  that  he  has  been  performing,  without 
complaint.  [Applause.]  To  take  that  man  from  the  field  of  usefulness 
and  construction  that  he  now  occupies  would  be  a  crime,  unless  he  could 
be  promoted  to  the  presidential  chair,  the  only  promotion  that  you  could 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  COXVKMIOX  347 

give  him.  I  hope  no  gentleman  here  will  suggest  his  name  for  Vice- 
President.  He  has  repeatedly  said  no,  and  ho  is  a  man  who  stands  by 
his  word. 

Now  my  friends,  one  more  word  and  I  will  conclude. 

Mr.  Underwood  directs  me.  as  the  humble  instrument  by  which  his 
campaign  has  been  conducted,  to  withdraw  his  name  from  before  this 
Convention.  [Applause.]  He  directs  me  further  to  thank  most  sincerely 
those  devoted  friends  who  have  stood  by  him  so  loyally  through  the 
tedious  hours  of  this  Convention.  They  can  never  be  blotted  from  his 
memory.  He  further  directs  me  to  say  to  the  members  of  this  Conven- 
tion that  no  feeling  of  resentment  or  animosity  exists  in  his  heart 
toward  any  member  of  the  Convention.  [Applause.] 

I  withdraw  his  name  from  before  the  Convention,  and  he  authorizes 
me  to  release  every  delegate  that  was  elected  for  and  instructed  to  vote 
for  him,  which  they  have  so  loyally  done  as  long  as  his  name  was 
before  the  Convention.  His  friends  are  at  liberty  to  vote  for  whom 
they  please.  [Applause.] 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  STOXE.  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  ask  unanimous 
consent  to  make  a  brief  statement. 

THE  PEEMAXEXT  CHAIRMAX:  Senator  Stone  of  Missouri  asks 
unanimous  consent  to  make  a  brief  statement.  Is  there  objection* 

There  was  no  objection. 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  STOXE.  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
of  the  Convention,  following  the  statement  of  Senator  Bankhead,  I 
desire  to  say  that,  speaking  for  Mr.  Clark,  I  will  release,  if  release  be 
necessary,  any  obligation  to  him  imposed  upon  any  delegate  in  this 
Convention.  [Applause.]  The  delegations  which  have  stood  by  him  so 
loyally  will  ever  be  remembered  by  him  as  his  friends,  with  devoted 
affection.  I  would  not  have  a  delegation  here  stand  under  a  sense  of 
obligation  to  him  for  another  ballot.  I  would  have  them  act  as  they 
now  think  best. 

So  far  as  the  Missouri  delegation  is  concerned,  under  the  peculiar 
circumstances  that  have  surrounded  this  Convention  and  its  proceed- 
ings, we  shall  vote  for  Speaker  Clark  until  the  last  ballot  is  cast. 
[Applause.]  If  the  verdict  shall  be  against  him  and  in  favor  of  another, 
I  need  not  go  to  the  trouble  of  pledging  this  Convention  and  the 
American  Democracy  that  old  Champ  Clark  and  his  friends  will  stand 
by  the  ticket.  [Applause.] 

MR.  JOHN  F.  FITZGERALD,  of  Massachusetts,  rose. 

THE  PERMAXEXT  CHAIRMAX:  Mayor  Fitzgerald  of  Boston  asks 
unanimous  consent  to  make  a  statement.  Is  there  objection? 

There  was  no  objection. 

Mi;.  .Unix  F.  FITZGERALD,  of  Massachusetts:  Mr.  Chairman  and 
gentlemen,  a  majority  of  the  Massachusetts  delegation  have  voted,  on  the 
last  doxen  or  more  ballots,  for  Eugene  Noble  Foss,  the  Governor  of  our 
illustrious  commonwealth.  In  the  contest  which  was  waged  in  Massa- 


348  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

chusetts  some  months  ago  he  was  not  a  candidate  before  the  people, 
preferring  that  the  other  candidates  from  the  different  parts  of  the 
country  should  submit  their  names  to  the  people,  and  let  the  delegation 
from  Massachusetts  vote  upon  them.  The  Massachusetts  delegation 
voted  on  twenty-one  ballots  for  Speaker  Clark,  and  then  the  friends 
of  Governor  Foss,  feeling  that  Mr.  Clark  could  not  be  nominated,  put 
Governor  Foss  into  the  race.  His  own  idea  was  that  he  should  not 
oppose  the  will  of  the  great  majority  of  this  Convention,  and  that  his 
candidacy  is  not  to  be  permitted  after  it  is  evident  that  someone  else 
is  the  choice  of  the  great  majority  of  the  Convention.  Therefore  in 
behalf  of  the  Massachusetts  delegation  I  withdraw  the  name  &lt;jf  Eugene 
Noble  Foss,  and  announce  that  Woodrow  Wilson  will  receive  the  vote 
of  that  delegation.  [Applause.] 

MR.  JOHN  J.  FITZGERALD,  of  New  York:  I  ask  unanimous  consent 
to  make  a  brief  statement. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr. 
Fitzgerald)  asks  unanimous  consent  to  make  a  statement.  Is  there 
objection  ? 

There  was  no  objection. 

MR.  JOHN  J.  FITZGERALD,  of  New  York:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentle- 
men of  the  Convention,  the  desire  of  every  Democrat  in  this  Convention 
is  that  we  may  leave  this  hall  united,  harmonious,  and  with  victory 
assured.  [Applause.]  Whatever  personal  preferences  delegates  may 
honestly  have  had  about  candidates,  every  loyal  Democrat  should  be 
willing  to  subordinate  his  personal  desires  to  the  success  of  the  Demo- 
cratic party.  [Applause.]  In  the  hope  that  this  Convention  may  ad- 
journ without  bitterness,  without  hard  feeling,  without  rancor  that  may 
affect  the  success  of  the  candidates  of  this  Convention,  in  order  to 
demonstrate  that  no  matter  how  hard  we  may  strive  for  the  success  of 
our  honest  opinions  we  are  willing  to  acquiesce  in  what  appears  to  be 
the  manifest  and  overwhelming  desire  of  this  Convention,  as  a  member 
of  the  New  York  delegation,  anxious  that  the  electoral  vote  of  New  York 
shall  be  in  the  Democratic  column,  I  move  that  the  roll-call  be  dispensed 
with,  and  that  by  acclamation  this  Convention  unanimously  nominate  for 
the  office  of  President  of  the  United  States  that  distinguished  Democrat 
from  New  Jersey,  Hon.  Woodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

MR.  JAMES  A.  EEED,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  going  to 
make  a  point  of  order  against  that  motion.  We  are  going  to  cast  our 
vote  for  Clark  on  the  last  ballot.  We  have  got  to  go  back  to  Missouri. 
[Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  motion  made  by  the  gentleman 
from  New  York  (Mr.  Fitzgerald)  can  only  be  entertained  by  unanimous 
consent.  Is  there  objection! 

MR.  EEED,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  without  the  slightest  desire 
to  indicate  any  feeling  or  resentment,  I  make  the  objection,  because 


DKMOCUATIC  NATION  M.  l'n\\  I:\TION  349 

Missouri    wants   to   be   recorded   on    this    ballot    for    old    Champ    Clark. 
[Applause.  1 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :     Senator  Keed,  of  Missouri,  objects. 
MR.  F.   H.   McCuLLOUGH,  of  Missouri:      Mr.   Chairman,  I  rise  to   a 
question  'of  personal  privilege.     I   desire   to   define   the  position  of  the 
Missouri  delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  That  is  not  a  question  of  personal 
privilege. 

Mr;.  Wn.i.iAM  HUGHES,  of  New  Jersey:  Mr.  Chairman,  I. ask  unani- 
mous consent  that  the  gentleman  be  permitted  to  make  a  statement. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:     I  object. 
.THE    PERMANENT    CHAIRMAN:      The    gentleman    from    Pennsylvania 
(Mr.  Palmer)   objects.     The  roll-call  -will  proceed. 

MR.  McCuLLOUGH,  of  Missouri :  I  ask  the  gentleman  to  withdraw 
the  objection. 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:     I  withdraw  it. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania 
(Mr.  Palmer)  withdraws  his  objection.  Does  anyone  else  object? 

There  was  no  objection. 

MR.  F.  H.  McCuLLOUGH,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen 
of  this  Convention,  as  a  delegate  from  Missouri,  representing  the  ten 
counties  of  the  first  Congressional  District,  I  desire  to  say  that  no  people 
ever  loved  a  man  as  the  Democrats  of  Missouri  love  old  Champ  Clark. 
[Applause.l  I  desire  to  say  that  no  one  deplores  more  than  I  do  the 
conditions  that  have  arisen  in  this  Convention.  I  wish  to  say  further 
that  Senator  Stone  has  correctly  voiced  the  unanimous  opinion  of  the 
Missouri  delegation.  We  are  for  Champ  Clark  first,  last,  and  all  the 
time.  [Applause.]  But  Missouri  stands  for  harmony  above  any  man, 
as  she  stands  for  victory  at  the  coming  November  election.  [Applause.] 

MR.  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  demand  the  regular- 
order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  regular  order  is  demanded.  The 
Secretary  will  call  the  roll. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll  of  States. 

The  State  of  California  was  called,  and  passed. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  (when  the  State  of  Ohio  was  called) : 
Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  Mr.  Moore,  of  Ohio,  manager  for  Governor 
Harmon,  requests  unanimous  consent  to  make  a  brief  statement.  Is 
there  objection? 

There  was  no  objection. 

MR.  ED.  H.  MOORE,  of  Ohio:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention,  I  am  not  Governor  Harmon's  manager,  but  simply  one  of 
the  455,000  loyal  Democrats  who  voted  for  him  twice  for  Governor,  and 
have  helped  in  our  humble  way  under  his  leadership  to  redeem  the  State 
of  Ohio  from  Eepublican  domination.  [Applause.]  Ohio  came  here  to 
present  to  this  Convention  a  candidate  vote-tried  and  ballot  tested.  Five 


350  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

times  has  be  sought  the  franchises  of  his  fellow  Democrats  and  of  the 
people  of  his  State,  and  ne\er  has  he  allowed  the  banner  of  the  party 
to  go  down  to  defeat.  Four  years  ago  he  carried  the  State  of  Ohio 
by  20,000,  when  on  the  same  day  and  on  the  same  ticket  the  Kepublie'an 
candidate  for  President  carried  it  by  70,000. 

Governor  Harmon  was  a  repeater.  He  came  back  two  years  ago  and 
carried  the  State  by  100,000.  He  has  given  to  our  State  a  record,  not 
alone  of  progressive  legislation,  but  of  progressive  and  reformed  execu 
tion  of  law  unequaled  in  any  State  in  this  Union.  [Applause.]  We 
thought  that  for  that  reason  we  had  a  fair  right  to  present  his  candi- 
dacy to  a  Democratic  -  National  Convention.  The  Democrats  of  this 
Convention  appear  to  be  about  to  make  their  choice  elsewhere,  and  on 
behalf  of  the  -6  loyal  Harmon  men  in  our  delegation  who  are  willing  to 
go  down  with  him  to  disastrous  defeat  unless  publicly  released  from 
the  obligation  (although  the  obligation  imposed  by  the  Ohio  State  Con- 
vention on  his  behalf  you  have  held  was  only  a  moral  one)  I  release 
the  delegates  of  Ohio  from  any  obligation,  moral  or  otherwise,  express 
or  implied,  that  rests  upon  them,  to  support  his  candidacy. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  W.  A.  COLLIER,  of  Oklahoma  (when  the  State  of  Oklahoma  was 
called) :  I  demand  a  roll-call  of  the  Oklahoma  delegation. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  In  order  to  save  time  may  the  Chair 
inquire  of  the  gentleman  if  a  majority  of  the  delegates  in  the  two 
units  from  Oklahoma  are  in  favor  of  Governor  Wilson?  If  so,  the  Chair 
appeals  to  the  gentleman  not  to  delay  the  proceedings  of  the  Conven- 
tion by  a  demand  for  a  poll  of  the  delegation. 

MR.  COLLIER,  of  Oklahoma:     I  withdraw  the  demand. 

The  roll-call  was  concluded. 

MR.  THEODORE  A.  BELL,  of  California  (when  the  State  of  California 
was  again  called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  before  I  east  the  vote  of  California, 
after  a  careful  poll  of  my  delegation,  I  ask  the  unanimous  consent  of  the 
Convention  to  make  a  very  brief  statement. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     Is  there  objection? 

Several  Delegates  objected. 

MR.  JAMES  HAMILTON  LEWIS,  of  Illinois :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  earnestly 
request  that  the  State  of  California  through  her  representative  may  hi* 
heard  to  speak  to  a  Democratic  Convention. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  If  there  be  no  objection  the  gentle- 
man from  California,  who  is  a  distinguished  Democrat,  having  fought 
the  battles  of  our  party  in  the  past,  will  proceed.  The  Chair  hears  none. 

MR.  BELL,  of  California:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the  Con- 
vention, I  want  to  assure  you  at  the  outset  that  the  moment  I  return 
V&gt;  the  golden  soil  of  California  I  shall  take  up  the  fight  for  Woodrow 
Wilson  in  that  Empire  State  of  the  West.  But  before  I  announce  the 
vote  of  my  delegation  on  this  last  roll-call.  I  serve  notice  now  that  if 
given  the  opportunity  after  the  vote  of  my  State  is  recorded  I  shall 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  351 

personally  move  to  make  the  nomination  of  Woodrow  Wilson  unanimous 
in  this  Convention.  [Applause.] 

My  State  for  forty-three  successive  roll-calls  has  cast  its  26  votes 
for  Champ  Clark,  and  we  unanimously  determined  among  ourselves  that 
so  long  as  an  opportunity  was  left  so  to  register  our  votes,  in  what  we 
believed  to  be  the  just  and  honorable  vindication  of  the  Speaker  of  the 
House  of  Representatives,  the  head  of  the  Democratic  party  of  this 
nation,  we  would  do  so,  and  the  California  delegation  have  instructed 
me  now  to  cast  their  vote  for  him  ;  and  I  want  our  reason  to  be  placed 
on  record. 

I  know  the  entire  California  delegation  will  join  me  later  in  making 
Mr.  Wilson  the  unanimous  choice  of  this  Convention. 

California  now,  upon  the  last  roll-call,  as  her  heartfelt  testimonial 
to  the  man  whom  she  believes  has  done  so  much  for  the  Democracy,  casts 
24  votes  for  Champ  Clark  and  2  for  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  having  resumed  and  concluded  the  calling  of  the  roll 
of  States,  etc.,  the  result  was  announced,  Wilson,  990,  Clark,  8'4,  Harmon, 
12,  not  voting  2,  as  follows:

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Before  declaring  the  nomination,  the 
Chair  recognizes  Senator  Stone,  of  Missouri. 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  STONE,  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  to  make 
the  nomination  of  Woodrow  Wilson  unanimous.  [Applause.] 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:     The  question  is  on  ags^eing  to  the 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  353 

motion  of  Senator  Stone,  of  Missouri,  to  make  the  nomination  of  Wood- 
row  Wilson  by  acclamation. 

The  motion  was  unanimously  agreed  to: 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  "ayes"  have  it  unanimously, 
and  I  declare  Woodrow  Wilson  of  New  Jersey  the  nominee  of  this 
Convention  for  the  office  of  President  of  the  United  States.  [Applause.] 

RECESS. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman  and 
gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  while  we  still  have  much  to  do  before 
the  work  of  the  Convention  is  finally  completed,  I  believe  that  we  will 
make  speed  if  we  now  rest  from  our  labors  for  a  little  while.  There  are 
committees  to  report  that  still  have  some  work  to  do.  There  are  many 
formal  resolutions  which  must  be  prepared  in  time  for  the  last  session. 
Committees  must  be  selected,  and  with  all  of  that,  the  work  of  this 
Convention  can  easily  be  concluded  during  a  short  session  tonight,  espe- 
cially if  time  is  now  given  to  those  committees  to  prepare  for  their  work. 

Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  Convention  take  a  recess  until  9 
o  'clock  tonight. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to,  and  (at  3  o'clock  and  40  minutes  p.  m.) 
the  Convention  took  a  recess  until  9  o'clock  p.  m. 

EVENING  SESSION. 

At   the  expiration   of  the   recess  the  Convention   reassembled. 
THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:   Rev.  Carlton  D.  Harris,  pastor  of  the 
Methodist  Episcopal  Church  South,  of  Baltimore,  Md.,  will  offer  prayer. 

PRAYER  OF  REV.  CARLTON  D.   HARRIS. 

K'F.V.  CARLTON  D.  HARRIS,  pastor  of  the  Methodist  Episcppal  Church 
South,  of  Baltimore,  Md.,  offered  the  following  prayer: 

O  Lord  God,  our  fathers'  God,  Author  of  life  and  being,  Source  of 
all  blessings — for  every  good  and  every  perfect  gift  is  from  above  and 
cometh  down  from  the  Father  of  Lights,  in  Whom  there  is  no  variableness 
or  shadow  of  turning — we  bless  Thee  for  our  great  Nation  and  her  vic- 
tories of  peace,  which  are  not  less  renowed  than  those  of  war.  We  thank 
Thee  for  her  commercial  advancement,  her  industrial  progress,  her  tri- 
umph in  art  and  science,  her  marked  growth  in  those  things  that  look 
toward  individual  and  civic  righteousness,  her  tremendous  influence  in 
shaping  the  destinies  of  men  and  Nations  throughout  the  earth. 

In  the  midst  of  these  unparalleled  blessings  we  feel  that  we  can 
truthfully  say,  in  the  language  of  inspiration,  that  Thou  hast  not  dealt 
so  with  any  other  nation;  and  we  pray  Thee  to  keep  us  humble,  and 
help  us  to  remember,  lest  we  forget,  the  source  of  our  power  and  glory 
as  a  Nation.  Help  us  to  treasure  the  Bible  as  a  lamp  unto  our  feet  and 
a  light  unto  our  path,  and  may  we,  in  all  of  our  governmental  affairs, 


OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

keep  in  mind  the  great  principles  that  ' '  righteousness  exalteth  a  nation, 
but  sin  is  a  reproach  to  any  people. ' ' 

We  pray  Thee  to  command  Thy  blessing  to  rest  upon  Thy  servant 
who  this  day  has  been  nominated  by  this  great  Convention  for,  the 
highest  position  within  the  gift  of  the  American  Republic.  Give  grace 
and  wisdom  unto  Thy  servants  who  are  here  assembled  for  the  selection 
of  a  candidate  for  the  Vice-Presidency  of  these  United  States.  We 
pray  Thee  to  bless  this  Presiding  Officer  and  this  entire  Convention, 
whose  arduous  labors  are  now  drawing  near  a  close.  May  peace,  harmony, 
and  brotherly  love  prevail.  Bless  not  only  our  Nation,  but  all  Nations 
of  the  earth,  and  at  last  bring  us  to  Thyself  in  heaven.  We  ask  it  in 
Jesus '  name.  Amen. 

NOMINATION    OF    CANDIDATE    FOR    VICE-PRESIDENT. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  next  thing  in  order  is  the  roll- 
call  of  the'  States  for  the  nomination  of  the  next  Vice-President  of  the 
United  States.  [Applause.]  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll. 

The  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

MR.  EMMET  O'NEAL,  of  Alabama  (when  the  State  of  Alabama  was 
called)  :  Alabama  has  no  nomination  to  make. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  ALFRED  RAUGHLEY,  of  Delaware  (when  the  State  of  Delaware 
was  called)  :  Delaware  yields  to  North  Dakota. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  JAMES  H.  HAWLEY,  of  Idaho  (when  the  State  of  Idaho  was 
called)  :  Idaho  yields  to  North  Dakota. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  H.  H.  DEAN,  of  Georgia  (when  the  State  of  Georgia  was  called) 
rose. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  Chair  recognizes  Mr.  H.  H. 
Dean,  of  Georgia,  to  make  a  nomination. 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  H.  H.  DEAN. 

MR.  DEAN,  of  Georgia  (when  the  State  of  Georgia  was  called) : 
Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the  Conventio'n,  coming  from  Georgia, 
the  empire  State  of  the  South,  .that  great  State  which  has  gone  Demo- 
cratic in  every  election  since  the  War,  and  coming  from  that  section  to 
which  you  must  look  to  roll  up  your  big  majorities  for  Woodrow  Wilson 
next  November,  I  think  I  present  the  necessary  credentials  to  authorize 
me  to  speak.  [Applause.] 

I  have  the  honor  to  be  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Perma- 
nent Organization,  and  when  we  first  met  in  that  room  over  there,  every- 
thing was  in  confusion  as  to  who  was  the  best  man  to  act  as  permanent 
chairman,  to  bring  about  ultimate  harmony  in  this  Convention.  After 
several  hours  deliberation  we  agreed  unanimously  upon  Representative 


DKMOCIIA  i  ic   XATIOXAI.  COXYKXTIOX  :J.V&gt; 

Ollie  M.  .lames,  -.if  Kentucky.  ;is  the  man  to  preside  over  the  delibera- 
tions of  this  Convention.  [Applause.]  And  he  has  made  a  superb 
presiding  officer.  [Appraise.]  I  reported  his  name  to  this  body,  and 
it  was  adopted  unanimously. 

Now,  on  the  evening  of  the  seventh  day  of  this  Convention,  after 
all  the  turmoil  and  strife,  after  a  manly  battle,  after  \ve  have  selected 
for  the  highest  office  in  this  world,  that  of  President  of  the  United 
States,  Woodrow  Wilson,  the  question  now  confronts  us,  whom  shall 
we  select  as  his  right  bower  and  running  mate? 

There  comes  a  time  when  a  great  people  have  a  right  to  draft  a 
great  man.  The  greatest  body  of  the  greatest  people  on  earth  are 
going  to  select  the  grandest  old  man  in  the  United  States  for  Vice-Presi- 
dent. "We  of  the  South  went  through  the  war  when  we  were  called  upon 
for  battle.  We  did  not  have  the  money  to  hire  somebody  to  go  in  our 
places,  and  we  did  not  have  anybody  to  hire.  They  just  drafted  us, 
and  when  a  man  Mas  drafted  he  went  into  the  fight  to  die,  when  he 
went  up  against  the  great  guns  of  the  North.  I  do  not  know  whether 
we  killed  anybody  up  there  or  not,  but  from  the  pension  roll  we  are 
paying  now  I  think  we  crippled  a  good  many. 

Now  is  the  time  to  name  a  man  who  does  not  want  the  office.  He 
may  say  he  will  refuse  it,  but  that  does  not  make  one  particle  of  differ- 
ence to  us.  We  want  a  man  who  will  bring  victory  in  November,  and 
harnu.nizc  the  entire  Democratic  party,  so  that,  different  from  the  way 
the  Republicans  left  their  Convention,  we  can  go  before  the  country 
united.  [Applause.] 

I  move  that  we  unanimously  nominate  the  man  who  is  nearest  the 
hearts  of  the  great  American  people  today,  that  grand  old  man  and 
veteran  in  the  ranks  of  Democracy,  Hon.  Champ  Clark,  of  Missouri. 
|  Applause.] 

MR.   ALEXANDER   M.  DOCKERY.  of  Missouri,  rose. 

THE  PKRMAXKXT  CHAIRMAN:  I  now  present  ex-Governor  Dockery, 
of  Missouri.  [Applause.] 

.Mi:.  IVn  KKI;Y.  of  Missouri:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
('(.mention,  I  appreciate  to  the  full  extent  the  compliment  sought  to 
be  paid  by  this  great  representative  bod}7  of  Democrats  to  the  most 
illustrious  Democrat  Missouri  now  has  in  public  life,  but  I  feel  it  to 
lie  due  to  him  and  to  you  to  say  after  full  and  careful  consideration 
of  this  suggestion  which  was  voiced  by  "the  gentleman  from  Georgia 
(Mr.  Dean),  after  more  than  an  hour's  consultation  with  several  dele- 
gaies  from  Missouri.  Hon.  Champ  Clark  has  decided  that  he  cannot 
accept  the  oihVe  of  Vice-President  [Applause.] 

I  am  proud  to  s;\y  to  the  members- of  this  Convention  that  tonight 
Cham]!  Clark  i&gt;  as  loyal  to  the  Democratic  party,  and  is  as  loyal  to  its 
nominee  for  President,  Woodrow  Wilson,  as  any  member  of  this  Con- 
vention. [Applause.]  During  our  conference  he  penned  a  congratula- 
tory telegram  to  the  next  President  of  the  United  States,  assuring  him 


356  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

of  his  loyalty,  and   his  purpose  to  do  all   that  he  can  to   elect  him   in 
November.     [Applause.] 

Champ  Clark  has  not  reached  his  conclusion  to  decline  the  Vice- 
Presidency  as  a  result  of  pique  or  any  selfish  motive.  He  simply  prefers 
the  position  he  now  holds,  or  a  position  as  a  representative  in  Congress, 
a  private  in  the  ranks,  rather  than  to  be  Vice-President  of  the  United 
States.  [Applause.]  I  have  thought  it  due  the  Convention  to  state 
his  deliberate  judgment,  so  that  no  mistake  might  be  made;  but  I  want 
the  members  of  this  body  to  understand  again  that  Champ  Clark  occupies 
tonight  the  same  position  in  respect  to  the  nominee  of  this  Convention 
for  President  that  every  member  of  the  Missouri  delegation  does.  We 
are  for  Wilson  first,  last  and  all  the  time,  and  old  Missouri  will  give 
the  nominees  of  this  Convention  a  sweeping  majority  in  November. 
[Applause.] 

Gentlemen,  I  thank  you  for  your  attention.  In  the  absence  of  Senator 
Stone,  the  chairman  of  our  delegation,  I  have  thought  it  proper  to  make 
this  announcement  at  the  present  time.  [Applause.] 

MR.  ALFRED  EAUGHLEY,  of  Delaware :  Mr.  Chairman,  when  Delaware 
was  called  she  yielded  to  North  Dakota. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  did  not  hear  the  announce 
ment,  and  will  now  recognize  North  Dakota. 

Delaware  and  Idaho  having  yielded  to  North  Dakota,  Senator  Pur- 
cell  will  present  the  name  of  North  Dakota 's  candidate  before  the  Con- 
vention. [Applause.] 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OP  W.  E.  PUBCELL. 

MR.  W.  E.  PURCELL,  of  North  Dakota:  Mr.  Chairman  and  fellow 
delegates,  the  State  of  North  Dakota  was  one  of  the  first  States  in 
the  Union  to  pass  a  primary  election  law  and  a  law  for  a  preferential 
presidential  primary.  It  was  also  the  first  State  in  the  Union  to  hold 
an  election  under  that  law,  at  which  election  it  gave  to  the  citizens  of 
that  State  the  opportunity  to  express  directly  their  preference  for  their 
candidate  in  this  Convention.  At  the  same  time  they  directly  selected 
their  delegates  to  this  Convention. 

The  delegates  from  that  State  to  this  Convention  are  sworn  to 
perform  their  duties  to  the  best  of  their  ability,  and  to  support  the 
Constitution  of  the  United  States,  and  they  receive  compensation  while 
performing  those  duties.  They  are  also  bound  to  support  the  person 
selected  by  their  party  in  that  State  as  their  preference  for  the  candi- 
date of  this  Convention. 

You  heard  read  a  letter  from  the  man  who  was  selected  by  the 
Democrats  of  North  Dakota  to  be  their  candidate  before  this  Conven- 
tion. In  that  letter  he  asked  our  delegation  not  to  present  his  name 
as  a  presidential  candidate,  feeling  that  the  men  already  presented  had 
such  national  reputation  that  the  Democracy  would  feel  bound  to  insure 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONYKNTION  357 

success  at  the  November  election  by  selecting  a  candidate  who  is  perhaps 
nearer  the  yreat  body  of  the  Democratic  voters  of  this  nation.  For  that 
reason  he  desired  that  the  expressed  wishes  of  his  constituents  should 
not  be  carried  out,  and  so  he  wrote  requesting  our  delegation  not  to 
present  his  name  to  this  convention  for  President,  and  left  the  delegation 
free  to  act  as  they  saw  fit. 

K\l&gt;ressing  the  wishes  of  the  people  of  the  great  Northwest,  and  in 
accordance  with  our  own  desires,  we  present  to  this  Convention  for  nomi- 
nation as  its  vice-presidential  candidate  the  name  of  John  Burke,  Gov- 
ernor of  North  Dakota.  [Applause.] 

The  State  of  North  Dakota  is  located  in  what  has  heretofore  been 
described  as  the  progressive  zone.  Its  people  are  all  agriculturists. 
Success  to  them  conies  slowly,  and  only  as  the  result  of  hard  and  arduous 
labor.  They  are  the  people  who  put  upon  the  tables  of  the  citizens 
of  this  country  those  things  which  sustain  life.  The  nefarious  tariff 
laws  passed  by  our  Eepublican  friends  have  for  the  past  sixteen  years 
borne  most  heavily  upon  this  class  of  people.  Those  laws  have  sapped 
the  substance  of  the  people,  and  have  further  bent  their  already  over- 
burdened backs,  and  would  have  almost  confiscated  their  hard-earned 
holdings  were  it  not  for  the  fertility  of  the  soil  and  the  bounty  of 
Providence  in  sending  us  good  crops. 

I  am  glad  to  say  that  of  all  the  men  in  the  Northwest  who  have 
made  progressive  records,  no  one  excels  the  record  made  by  John  Burke. 
|  Applause.] 

In  1904  the  Eepublican  majority  in  the  State  of  North  Dakota  was 
larger,  in  proportion  to  the  population,  than  in  any  other  State  in  this 
Union.  In  1906  the  Bepublican  party  in  North  Dakota  had  one  of  the 
greatest  machines  that  existed  in  the  nation.  It  was  closely  allied 
with  the  railroads,  with  combinations  of  predatory  wealth,  and  with  other 
great  "interests."  It  had  unlimited  money.  It  had  all  the  newspapers 
in  the  State,  some  312  in  number,  and  back  of  all  these  it  had  control 
of  the  great  Federal  patronage  belonging  to  that  State.  John  Burke 
\\as  nominated  by  the  Democratic  party  in  the  face  of  all  these  great 
odds;  and  without  the  aid  of  any  factor  such  as  I  have  mentioned,  he 
succeeded  in  overcoming  the  Bepublican  majority  and  planting  the  flag 
of  Democracy  at  tlio  capitol  of  the  State  of  North  Dakota.  [Applause.] 
His  administration  of  that  office  being  satisfactory  to  the  people,  he  was 
again  elected  Governor  of  the  State  of  North  Dakota  in  1908;  and  hav- 
ing given  evidence  of  the  results  of  experience,  again  in  1910  he  was 
elected  for  the  third  time  Governor  of  the  State  of  North  Dakota. 
[Applause.] 

Since  he  has  been  Governor  he  has  secured  the  passage  of  the  anti- 
pass  law,  the  primary  election  law,  the  presidential  preferential  primary 
law,  the  law  regulating  railroad  taxation,  the  initiative  and  referendum, 
and  many  other  laws,  all  of  which  have  been  progressive  in  their  nature. 
[Applause.] 


358  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

Our  Ecpublican  friends  have  been  unable  to  find  one  single  blot  or 
blemish  upon  his  character  or  reputation.  He  is  fifty-two  years  of  age. 
married,  with  a  family  of  three-  children,  is  a  lawyer  by  profession,  born 
in  the  State  of  Iowa,  and  a  graduate  from  the  law  department  of  'the 
University  of  that  State.  He  stands  in  the  front  rank  of  the  lawyers 
of  the  State  of  North  Dakota.  His  friends  in  our  sister  State  of  Min- 
nesota  on  the  east  know  him  well.  His  words  of  wisdom  have  lent  aid 
and  comfort  'to  them  in  their  struggle,  and  he  is  to  our  State  what  the 
lamented  J.  A.  Johnson  was  to  the  State  of  Minnesota. 

Our  twin  sister  on  the  south  has  also  been  able,  by  following  his 
example,  to  make  herself  formidable  against  our  Eepublican  enemies, 
and  our  sister  on  the  west  has  taken  courage  and  comfort  from  the  force 
of  his  example.  These  four  States  today  are  asking  this  Convention 
to  give  them  John  Burke  as  running  mate  for  the  honorable  gentleman 
whom  we  have  mentioned  aswthe  head  of  our  ticket.  [Applause.] 

Fellow  Democrats,  I  am  glad  to  say  that  progressivism  is  not  con- 
fined in  our  State  to  the  Democratic  party.  The  Eepublican  party  of 
that  State  is  also  progressive.  That  is  shown  by  the  fact  that  out  of 
52,000  Eepublican  votes  cast  in  the  last  primary  election,  Mr.  Taft 
received  only  1,100  votes.  At  the  same  time  they  refused  to  give-  the 
delegation  of  that  State  to  him  who  coveted  wliat  Washington,  Jeffer- 
son and  Jackson  refused,  and  who  wished  to  attain  what  the  great  soldier 
Grant  could  not  obtain — a  third  term  as  President  of  the  United  States. 

So  progressivism  is  growing  fast  in  the  Northwest,  and  we  ask  you 
to  give  us  a  man  who  has  shown  by  his  actions  to  be  in  sympathy  with 
the  farming  element  of  the  country,  with  the  man  in  the  factory,  with 
the  man  in  the  mill,  and  with  all  tho?e  who  heretofore  have  been  clamor 
ing  in  the  Bepublican  party  for  better  things  too  long  delayed,  and  who 
stand  ready  now,  when  the  proper  man  is  presented,  to  leave  their  own 
party  and  go  to  that  party  which  stands  for  the  things  they  have 
demanded  and  been  refused  in  the  Eepublican  party.  Such  a  man,  I 
assure  you,  is  John  Burke,  the  present  Governor  of  North  Dakota. 
[Applause.] 

MR.  JAMES  II.  HAWLEY,  of  Idaho:  Mr.  Ghairman,  Idaho  seconds 
the  nomination  of  Hon.  John  Burke.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll, 

MK.  SAMUEL  ALSCHULER,  of  Illinois  (when  the  Slate  of  Illinois  w:t- 
called)  rose. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Mr.  Samuel  Alschuler  of  Illinois  will 
address  the  Convention. 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  SAMUEL  ALSCHULKR. 

MK.    ALSCHULER,  of   Illinois:      Mr.   Chairman  and   fellow    &lt;lrir_ 
I  come  from  that  State  which  clasped  hands  with  its  neighbor  across  the 
Father  of  Waters  in  the  fond  hope  that  the  great  man  from  Missouri 


!  &gt;I..MOCKATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  359 

might  be  nominated  by  this  Convention  for  the  Presidency  of  the 
United  States.  The  State  of  Illinois,  third  in  the  galaxy  of  States,  has 
been  content,  in  the  proceedings  of  this  great  historic  convention,  to 
confine  its  activity  to  declaring,  ballot  after  ballot,  in  favor  of  that 
grand  son  of  Missouri  whom  Illinois  chose  by  so  tremendous  a  majority 
in  the  preferential  presidential  primary.  [Applause.] 

This  great  convention  has  seen  fit  to  voice  tLe  sentiment  of  the 
democracy  of  the  entire  Union,  greater  than  the  democracy  of  any  one 
State,  in  favor  of  another,  and  Illinois,  though  yesterday  fondly  hopeful 
for  the  success  of  the  favorite  son  of  her  sister  State,  now  joins  with 
Missouri  and  the  democracy  of  this  entire  united  country  in  saying  we 
are  all  ready  to  march  shoulder  to  shoulder  under  the  leadership  of  the 
grand  standard  bearer  who  has  been  selected  by  this  Convention. 
[Applause.] 

A  great  authority  lias  declared  that  a  baseball  team  is  as  strong  as 
its  weakest  substitute.  So  in  this  great  national  game  of  polities, 
which  is  to  be  fought  out  next  November,  the  ticket  is  as  strong  as  the 
man  who  is  nominated  to  be,  in  certain  contingencies,  the  President  of 
the  United  States. 

The  State  of  Illinois  has  been  content  to  vote  in  these  proceedings, 
and  not  take  up  the  time  with  talk,  and  it  is  now  going  further  to  favor 
this  Convention  by  presenting  to  you  for  your  consideration  a  candidate 
for  Yice-President.  Illinois  is  the  only  State  which  in  nearly  twenty-five 
years  has  given  to  the  democracy  an  actual  Yice-President,  that  grand 
old  man  who  lives  in  Illinois,  for  whom  I  know  the  hearts  of  this  great 
Democratic  convention  go  out  tonight,  wishing  him  long  life  and 
prosperity — that  grand  old  Democrat,  Adlai  Stevenson.  [Applause.] 

What  Illinois  lias  once  so  signally  and  splendidly  done  for  the 
Democracy  and  for  the  nation,  it  stands  willing  and  ready  to  do  again 
in  presenting  to  you  the  name  of  a  man,  honored  and  respected  through- 
out that  great  State  of  Illinois,  a  man  who  has  been  weighed  often  and 
never  found  wanting,  a  man  who  has  frequently  been  entrusted  with 
public  position,  who  in  public  and  private  life  is  without  reproach,  a  man 
whose  very  name  is  one  to  conjure  with  throughout  that  great  State, 
and  in  the  States  surrounding.  His  name  would  have  gone  forth  to 
all  parts  of  this  great  land,  but  there  has  not  been  much  opportunity 
of  late  years  for  Democrats  in  Illinois  to  become  famous.  We  have 
half  a  million  of  them  there,  and  with  the  splendid  nomination  that  has 
been  made,  and  with  a  fitting  man  named  for  Vice-President,  that  half 
million  will  be  swelled  and  added  to  until  I  am  sure  we  can  all  but 
promise  you  the  electoral  vote  of  that  great  State.  [Applause.] 

The  delegation  from  Illinois  instructs  me;  it  is  my  great  honor  and 
my  rare  pleasure,  it  is  by  the  desire  of  those  half  million  Democrats  in 
the  State  of  Illinois  that  I  name  to  you  for  your  consideration  as  candi- 
date for  the  high  office  of  Vice-President,  a  man  who  will  be  a  tower 
of  strength  in  the  State  of  Illinois;  a  lawyer,  a  business  man,  a  man

who  was  born  and  has  always  lived  in  the  State  of  Illinois,  a  man  who 
sits  with  us  as  a  delegate  at  large  from  that  State,  and  has  helped  to 
make  this  splendid  nomination  for  the  Presidency — Elmore  W.  Hurst, 
of  Illinois.  [Applause.] 

MR.  LUKE  LEA,  of  Tennessee :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the 
nominating  speeches  for  candidates  for  Vice-President  be  limited  to 
five  minutes,  and  the  seconding  speeches  to  three  minutes. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  William  Hughes,  of  New  Jersey,  in 
the  chair) :  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the  motion  of  the  Senator 
from  Tennessee. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  BENJAMIN  F.  SHIVELY  (when  the  State  of  Indiana  was  called) : 
Mr.  Chairman,  Major  G.  F.  Menzies,  of  Indiana,  will  present  to  the 
Convention  the  name  of  its  candidate  for  Vice-President.  [Applause.] 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  G.  F.  MENZIES. 

MR.  G.  F.  MENZIES,  of  Indiana:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  at  the  request  and  on  behalf  of  the  delegation  from  the 
State  of  Indiana  I  have  the  honor  to  present  for  your  consideration 
as  a  candidate  for  the  office  of  Vice-President,  Governor  Thomas  R. 
Marshall.  [Applause.]  His  eminent  fitness  and  qualifications  for  the 
first  place  on  the  ticket  were  so  ably  presented  by  Senator  Shively  that 
I  can  add  nothing  to  that  presentation. 

Governor  Marshall,  of  Virginia  ancestry,  took  his  political  faith  in 
his  mother's  milk.  Without  deviation  or  shadow  of  turning  he  has 
f ollpwed  the  footsteps  of  Thomas  A.  Hendricks,  Joseph  E.  McDonald 
and  Daniel  W.  Voorhees,  and  last  but  not  least,  David  Turpie.  Governor 
Marshall  belongs  to  the  State  of  an  unconquered  and  unconquerable 
democracy;  and  I  appeal  to  the  memories  of  the  delegates  to  this 
Convention,  and  especially  of  the  gentlemen  from  the  Southland,  to  go 
back  to  the  dark  days  of  1870,  when  there  was  gloom  in  those  down- 
trodden States,  when  vampires  and  camp  followers  of  the  Union  army 
overran  all  your  local  governments,  and  an  army  more  terrible  than  the 
other  army  with  banners  came  upon  your  fair  land  and  scourged  it. 
In  those  days,  where  did  you  get  the  first  gleam  of  hope?  Where  was 
the  wall  of  radicalism  first  breached?  In  the  State  of  Indiana.  The 
first  State  of  the  North  carried  by  the  Democracy  after  the  War  was 
Indiana,  and  it  turned  the  tide  of  radicalism  and  helped  you  to  resume 
the  white  man's  civilization  of  the  South.  [Applause.] 

In  his  young  manhood,  Thomas  R.  Marshall,  of  Old  Virginia  ancestry, 
joined  in  the  ranks  and  followed  Hendricks,  McDonald,  Voorhees  and 
Turpie. 

Indiana  makes  no  demand  upon  this  Convention.  We  merely  respect- 
fully submit  our  claims  to  your  consideration.  We  will  carry  the  ticket 


XATIOXAL  COXYKNTION  361 

no  matter  whom  you  nominate.  [Applause.]  You  can  safely  count 
upon  the  electoral  vote  of  Indiana.  But  Governor  Marshall's  name  upon 
the  ticket  will  add  great  stien^th  to  it  in  Indiana  aud  throughout  this 
nation.  Without  making  any  demand,  we  ask  you  each  and  all  to  aid 
in  the  nomination  of  Governor  Marshall.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  call  of  the  roll. 

MR.  CLAUDE  R.  PORTER,  of  Iowa  (when  the  State  of  Iowa  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman.  Mr.  Henry  Yolmer,  of  Iowa,  will  speak  for 
that  State. 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  HENRY  YOLMER. 

MR.  HKXRY  YOLMER,  of  Iowa:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the 
Convention.  Iowa  of  necessity  has  had  but  n  modest  voice  in  Democratic 
National  Conventions  of  the  past; -but  the  times  are  changing.  The 
schools  and  colleges  of  that  State,  of  which  she  possesses  a  greater 
number  in  proportion  to  population  than  any  other  State  in  the  Union, 
have  been  graduating  Democrats  year  after  year.  As  the  very  leader 
and  idol  of  the  struggling,  steadily  increasing  and  unterrified  young 
Democracy  of  that  State,  we  present  to  you  the  name,  the  name  of  Judge 
Martin  J.  Wade,  of  Iowa.  [Applause.] 

I  make  the  confident  prediction  that  in  the  beautiful  alliteration, 
Wilson  and  Wade,  our  ticket  will  sweep  the  State  from  the  Father  of 
Waters  to  the  Big  Muddy.  My  friends,  I  expect  that  some  of  you 
who  believe  you  are  going  to  attend  a  Republican  funeral  this  year 
will  be  disappointed,  because  I  believe  it  will  be  only  an  exemplification 
of  the  story  of  little  Johnny,  who  came  to  his  mother  one  day  and  said: 
''Mother,  the  neighbor's  children  have  found  such  a  beautiful  dead 
cat,  and  they  are  going  to  give  her  the  grandest  funeral.  May  I  go?" 
itainly.  Johnny,  run  right  along."  After  a  while  little  Johnny 
returned,  ami  his  mother  said  to  him,  "Well,  Johnny,  did  they  have 
a  grand  funeral?"  "No,  there  wasn't  no  funeral;  the  cat  was  too 
dead.1'  [Laughter.]  With  Wilson  and  Wade  the  Republican  funeral 
will  be  superfluous.  Gentlemen,  I  commend  that  ticket  to  you. 
[Applause.] 

MR.  MARTIN  J.  WADE,  of  Iowa.  rose. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  Judge 
Martin  J.  Wade,  of  Iowa,  desires  to  address  you. 

MR.  MARTIN  J.  WADE,  of  Iowa :  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of 
the  Convention,  I  rise  to  thank  my  good  friends  for  their  kindness,  but 
they  have  placed  me  in  this  very  embarrassing  position;  because  I  am 
going  to  present  now  to  this  Convention 'a  man  who  is  so  much  better 
than  I  that  there  is  no  comparison. 

v.".'  have  had  a  splendid  Convention.  There  has  been  some  bitter- 
n.'-s.  there  have  been  some  contests,  there  has  been  some  strife,  but 
alter  all  that  is  what  a  Convention  is  for.  Now  we  have  it  all  out 


362  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

of  our  systems.  The  man  whom  I  supported  did  not  receive  the  nomina- 
tion, but  we  have  nominated  one  of  the  greatest  men  in  the  United 
States  in  the  person  of  Woodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.]  All  the  followers 
of  the  gallant  Champ  Clark  will  work  just  as  hard  for  the  election  of 
Woodrow  Wilson  as  they  toiled  for  the  nomination  of  their  candidate. 

And  now,  as  we  go  into  the  forthcoming  campaign  with  this  splendid 
personality,  ready  to  meet  the  great  questions  of  the  hour,  capable  of 
filling  the  office  of  the  Presidency  with  honor  and  benefit  to  the  American 
people,  Woodrow  Wilson  needs  by  his  side  in  the  race  and  in  the 
Capitol  a  man  of  devotion  to  Democratic  principles  and  of  capacity  to 
aid  in  the  establishment  and  enforcement  of  those  principles. 

North  Dakota  has  spoken.  I  say  to  you,  my  friends,  listen  to  the 
voice  of  the  great  West.  Out  there  are  the  great  prairies,  the  great 
mountains,  the  great  mines  and  the  mighty  rivers,  and  out  there  also 
are  the  great  men  and  the  mighty  ideas;  and  no  man  stands  higher 
in  that  great  West  than  that  man  named  in  behalf  of  North  Dakota, 
John  Burke.  [Applause.]  John  Burke  and  I  sat  side  by  side  in  the 
old  university  of  Iowa.  We  were  graduated  at  the  same  hour.  We 
started  out  in  the  world  together.  He  went  way  up  into  the  Northwest 
when  it  was  a  pioneer  country.  He  loved  the  great  common  people, 
he  loved  the  strife  and  struggle  on  the  border.  There  he  went  and 
,began  the  practice  of  his  profession,  and  he  has  risen  by  steady  effort 
and  honest  endeavor  until  he  has  attained  a  prominence  and  a  record  not 
equaled  by  any  other  man  in  the  United  States.  Three  times  he  has 
been  elected  Governor  of  a  Eepublican  State,  and  he  could  be  elected 
as  many  times  as  he  would  ask.  This  honor  has  come  to  him  not 
because  he  has  used  any  of  the  means  or  methods  of  the  demagogue, 
but  because  he  has  stood  four-square  to  all  the  winds,  honest,  sincere, 
loyal,  patriotic,  believing  in  the  rights  of  labor  and  capital,  and 
insisting  upon  justice  for  both.  [Applause.] 

John  Burke  is  a  typical  American,  broad-gauge,  of  the  highest  ideals, 
the  purest  private  life;  and  Woodrow  Wilson  will  find  in  him  a  man 
who  will  stand  by  his  skle  a  tower  of  strength. 

I  extend  my  thanks  to  my  friends  who  have  so  kindly  suggested  my 
name,  but  the  name  that  we  need  on  this  ticket  is  that  of  John  Burke, 
of  North  Dakota.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  S.  H.  MARTIN,  of  Kansas  (when  the  State  of  Kansas  was  called)  : 
Mr.  Chairman,  Kansas  desires  to  second  the  nomination  of  Hon.  John 
Burke.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  ROBERT  EWING,  of  Louisiana  (when  the  State  of  Louisiana  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  in  behalf  of  eighteen  delegates  from  Louisiana. 
I  desire  to  second  the  nomination  of  Governor  Marshall,  of  Indiana. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll.

MR.  JOHN  WALTER  SMITH,  of  Maryland  (when  the  State  of  Mary- 
laud  was  called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  Mr.  Alonzo  L.  Miles,  of  Baltimore, 
will  address  the  Convention  on  behalf  of  Maryland. 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  ALONZO  L.  MILES. 

MR.  MILK-;,  of  Maryland:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen — I  say 
"gentlemen"  by  way  of  contrast  to  the  recent  proceedings  at  Chicago 
— Maryland  was  one  of  the  original  thirteen  States  of  the  Union. 
Maryland  stands  on  the  border  of  Mason  and  Dixon's  line,  which  should 
no  longer  exist  except  in  history.  In  1812,  when  the  British  fleet  was 
about  to  bombard  Fort  McHenry  and  destroy  the  town  of  Baltimore, 
Maryland  produced  the  man  who,  as  he  saw  the  American  flag  floating 
over  Fort  McHenry.  was  inspired  to  sing — 

"Then  conquer  we  must. 
For  our  cause  it  is  just; 
And  this  be  our  motto, 
In  God  is  our  trust"; 
And  the  Star  Spangled  Banner 

Oh  long  7iiay  it  wave, 
O  'er  the  land  of  the  free 
And  the  home  of  the  brave. 

[Applause.] 

Maryland,  whose  name  and  fame  are  perpetuated  in  poetry  and  song, 
a-  ••Maryland.  My  Maryland."  appeals  to  you,  and  your  temporary 
home,  historic  Baltimore,  appeals  to  you.  Baltimore  is  replete  with 
history,  commercial,  educational  and  political.  The  first  steam  packet 
that  sailed  regularly  from  the  United  States  across  the  ocean  sailed 
from  Baltimore  in  1838.  The  first  telegraphic  message  ever  sent  over 
Morse's  line  was  transmitted  from  Baltimore  to  Washington,  in  the 
words  ' '  What  hath  God  wrought  ? ' '  Baltimore  erected  the  first  monu- 
ment to  Columbus.  Baltimore  erected  the  first  official  monument  to 
George  Washington. 

Not  only  has  Baltimore  entertained  this  Convention,  but  Baltimore 
is  the  ancient  home  of  the  Democracy,  for  here  it  was  that  Andrew 
Jackson  was  nominated.  [Applause.]  It  is  a  prophetic  omen  that  the 
National  Democracy  after  nearly  a  century,  has  come  back  home  to 
Baltimore,  where  Andrew  Jacks  m  was  nominated.  [Applause.]  Within 
forty-eight  hours  of  the  birthday  anniversary  of  the  greatest  country 
on  the  face  of  the  earth,  we  have  nominated  the  next  President  of  the 
United  States.  [Applause.] 

The  united  Democracy  cf  Maryland  in  convention  assembled,  by 
resolution  unanimously  directed  its  delegation  to  recommend  to  this  Con- 
vention the  name  of  Hon.  James  II.  Preston,  as  a  candidate  for  Vice 
President  of  the  United  States,  in  the  following  language — 


364  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

' '  WHEREAS,  The  press  of  the  country  and  many  distinguished  leaders 
of  the  Democratic  party  have  suggested  the  nomination  of  the  Hon. 
James  H.  Preston,  now  Mayor  of  the  City  of  Baltimore,  as  Vice  Presi- 
dent of  the  Unite'd  States,  and  this  suggestion  has  been  received  with 
the  warmest  approval  on  the  part  of  the  citizens  of  Maryland,  as  ex- 
pressed in  many  meetings,  and  in  the  local  press;  and, 

"WHEREAS,  By  the  honest,  fearless,  progressive  and  public-spirited 
manner  in  which  James  H.  Preston  has  conducted  the  affairs  of  Balti- 
more City  as  its  Mayor,  he  has  shown  executive  ability  of  high  order, 
such  as  fully  justifies  the  confidence  of  the  people  of  Maryland;  and, 

"WHEREAS,  Baltimore  is  the  place  of  meeting  of  the  National  Con- 
vention, and  this  and  the  party  services  of  Mr.  Preston  would  render 
such  a  nomination  eminently  proper;  and, 

"WHEREAS,  The  State  of  Maryland  and  the  City  of  Baltimore  are 
the  gateway  between  North  and  South  and  no  Southern  State  has  re- 
ceived any  recognition  on  the  National  Ticket  for  many  years;  therefore, 

"Be  It  Resolved,  That  this  Convention  recommend  to  the  delegates 
from  Maryland  to  the  National  Democratic  Convention,  that  they  use 
every  honorable  effort  to  secure  the  nomination  of  the  Hon.  James  H. 
Preston  as  Vice  President  of  the  United  States." 

To  those  of  you  who  know  Mayor  Preston,  nothing  need  be  said. 

To  those  of  you  who  do  not  intimately  know  him,  I  want  to  say,  that 
if  I  were  asked  to  state  his  strongest  trait  of  character  I  would  say  that 
it  is  his  utter  fearlessness  in  the  discharge  of  his  duties  as  he  honestly 
understands  and  comprehends  them.  When  he  sets  his  face  toward  what 
he  conceives  to  be  his  duty,  Prince,  Potentate,  nor  Power — a  hostile 
press  nor  selfish  political  critics — can  turn  his  head  in  the  other  direc- 
tion. [Applause.] 

This  is  what  has  made  him  one  of  the  best  Mayors  Baltimore  lias 
had  in  my  recollection. 

He  is  distinctively  a  Democrat,  loyal  to  his  party  and  devoted  to  his 
friends,  and  yet  broad  enough  not  to  let  his  loyalty  to  his  party  and  his 
devotion  to  his  friends  interfere  with  his  executive  duties. 

That  is  Mayor  Preston. 

Commanding  in  appearance,  strong  in  intellect,  of  good  address,  if 
you  will  nominate  him  as  Vice  President  no  one  can  better  go  through- 
out this  country  and  uphold  the  arms  of  Woodrow  Wilson,  whom  you 
have  nominated  for  President. 

I  therefore  place  in  nomination  before  this  Convention  the  name  of 
the  Hon.  James  H.  Preston,  the  Mayor  of  Baltimore.  [Applause.] 

REPORT  OF  COMMITTEE  ON  RESOLUTIONS. 

MR.  A.  MITCHELL  PALMER,  of  Pennsylvania:  Mr.  Chairman  and  gen- 
tlemen of  the  Convention,  the  rules  adopted  by  the  Convention  provide 
that  after  the  candidates  for  President  and  Vice  President  have  been 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  365 

named,  consideration  shall  be  given  to  the  report  of  the  Committee  on 
Eesolutions.  I  understand  that  the  Committee  on  Kesolutions  are  now 
ready  to  report  our  platform,  and  I  desire  to  make  the  suggestion,  and  • 
I  make  it  in  the  form  of  a  request  for  unanimous  consent,  that  we  vacate 
the  pending  order  until  12  o'clock,  and  in  the  meantime  take  up  the 
report  of  the  Committee  on  Eesolutions. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  asks 
unanimous  consent  to  suspend  the  roll  call,  and  that  the  Convention 
proceed  to  consider  the  report  of  the  Committee  on  Eesolutions.  Is  there 
objection? 

MR.  11.  IT.  DEAN,  of  Georgia:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  object. 

THE  PERMANENT  (  HAIRMAN:  The  Chair  wants  to  make  a  suggestion 
in  the  nature  of  a  request.  This  is  a  matter  of  importance.  The  Com- 
mittee on  Resolutions  are  here  to  make  a  report,  and  the  Chair  hopes 
that  no  Democrat  who  loves  his  party  will  interpose  an  objection  to  the 
request  of  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  (Mr.  Palmer)  which  is 
made  in  the  interest  of  success  and  for  the  good  of  the  Democratic  party. 

MR.  G.  B.  HUTCHENS,  of  Georgia:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  object 
to  any  change  in  the  regular  order. 

MR.  DEAN,  of  Georgia:  Mr.  Chairman,  since  I  made  my  objection. 
I  have  been  informed  of  the  reason  for  the  change  which  is  desired  in 
the  order  of  business.  It  is  in  hearty  accord  with  my  own  wishes,  and 
I  withdraw  my  objection. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  The  objection  is  withdrawn.  Unani- 
mous consent  is  given  for  the  vacation  of  the  order.  Therefore,  Senator 
Kern,  of  Indiana,  Chairman  of  the  Committee  on  Eesolutions,  is  recog- 
nized to  read  the  platform  that  Is  going  to  be  presented  for  your  con- 
sideration. 

THE  PLATFORM. 

Mi;.  JOHN  W.  KERN,  of  Indiana:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  the  honor 
io  present  to  the  Convention  the  following  report  of  the  Committee  on 
Eesolutions,  which  was  adopted  by  the  full  committee  without  a  dis- 
senting voice: 

We.  the  representatives  of  the  Democratic  party  of  the  United  States, 
in  national  convention  assembled,  reaffirm  our  devotion  to  the"  principles 
of  Democratic  government  fonutilalod  by  Thomas  Jefferson  and  enforced 
by  a  long  and  illustrious  line  of  Democratic  Presidents. 

TARIFF    REFORM. 

We  declare  it  to  be  a  fundamental  principle  of  the  Democratic  party 
that  the  Federal   government,  under   the  Constitution,  has  no  right   of 
power  to  impose  or  collect  tariff  duties,  except  for  the  purpose  of  reve- 
nue, and  we  do.nand  that  the  collection  of  such  taxes  shall  6e  limited  to 
the   necessities   of   government   honestly   and   economically   administered.- 

The  high  Eepublican  tariff  is  the  principal  cause  of  the  unequal  dis- 


366  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

tribution  of  wealth;  it  is  a  system  of  taxation  which  makes  the  rich 
richer  and  the  poor  poorer;  under  its  operations  the  American  farmer 
and  laboring  man  are  the  chief  sufferers;  it  raises  the  cost  of  the  neces- 
saries of  life  to  them,  but  does  not  protect  their  product  or  wages.  The 
/"farmer  sells  largely  in  free  markets  and  buys  almost  entirely  in  the  pro 
tected  markets.  In  the  most  highly  protected  industries,  such  as  cotton 
and  wool,  steel  and  iron,  the  wages  of  the  laborers  are  the  lowest  paid 
in  any  of  our  industries.  We  denounce  the  Republican  pretense  on  that 
subject  and  assert  that  American  wages  are  established  by  competitive 
___ conditions,  and  not  by  the  tariff. 

We  favor  the  immediate  downward  revision  of  the  existing  high  and 
in  many  cases  prohibitive  tariff  duties,  insisting  that  material  reductions 
be  speedily  made  upon  the  necessaries  of  life.  Articles  entering  into 
competition  with  trust-controlled  products  and  articles  of  American  man- 
ufacture which  are  sold  abroad  more  cheaply  than  at  home  should  be  put 
upon  the  free  list. 

f  We  recognize  that  our  system   of  tariff   taxation   is   intimately   con 

/        nected  with  the  business  of  the  country,  and  we  favor  the  ultimate  attain- 
I        ment  of  the  principles  wre  advocate  by  legislation  that  will  not  injure  or. 

(&gt; destroy  legitimate  industry. 

We  denounce  the  action  of  President  Taft  in  vetoing  the  bills  to 
reduce  the  tariff  in  the  cotton,  woolen,  metal,  and  chemical  schedules 
and  the  farmers'  free  list  bill,  all  of  which  were  designed  to  give  imme- 
diate relief  to  the  masses  from  the  exactions  of  the  trusts. 

The  Republican  party,  while  promising  tariff  revision,  has  shows-  \&lt;y 
its  tariff  legislation  that  such  revision  is  not  to  be  in  the  people's  inter- 
est, and  having  been  faithless  to  its  pledges  of  1908,  it  should  no  longer 
enjoy  the  confidence  of  the  nation.  We  appeal  to  the  American  people 
to  support  us  in  our  demand  for  a  tariff  for  revenue  only. 

HIGH  COST  OF  LIVING. 

The  high  cost  of  living  is  a  serious  problem  in  every  American  home. 
The  Republican  party,  in  its  platform,  attempts  to  escape  from  respon- 
sibility for  present  conditions  by  denying  that  they  are  due  to  a  protec- 
tive tariff.  We  take  issue  with  them  on  this  subject,  and  charge  mat 
excessive  prices  result  in  a  large  measure  from  the  high  tariff  laws 
enacted  and  maintained  by  the  Republican  party  and  from  trusts  and 
commercial  conspiracies  festered  and  encouraged  by  such  laws,  and  wi&gt; 
assert  that  no  substantial  relief  can  be  secured  for  the  people  until 
.  import  duties  on  the  necessaries  of  life  are  materially  reduced  and  these 
criminal  conspiracies  broken  up. 

ANTITRUST    LAW. 

A  private  monopoly  is  indefensible  and  intolerable.  We  therefore 
favor  the  vigorous  enforcement  of  the  criminal  as  well  as  the  civil  law 
against  trusts  and  trust  officials,  and  demand. the  enactment  of  such 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONTENTION  367 

additional  legislation  as  may  be  necessary  to  make  it  impossible  for  a 
private  monopoly  to  exist  in  the  United  States. 

We  favor  the  declaration  by  law  of  the  conditions  upon  which  cor- 
porations shall  be  permitted  to  engage  in  interstate  trade,  including, 
among  others,  the  prevention  of  holding  companies,  of  interlocking 
directors,  of  stock  watering,  of  discrimination  in  price,  and  the  control 
by  any  one  corporation  of  so  large  a  proportion  of  any  industry  as  toy 
make  it  a  menace  to  competitive  conditions.  — ^ 

We  condemn  the  action  of  the  Kepublican  administration  in  compro- 
mising with  the  Standard  Oil  Company  and  the  tobacco  trust,  and  its 
failure  to  invoke  the  criminal  provisions  of  the  antitrust  law  against  the 
officers  of  those  corporations  after  the  court  had  declared  that  from  the 
undisputed  facts  in  the  record  they  had  violated  the  criminal  provisions 
of  the  law.  • 

We  regret  that  the  Sherman  antitrust  law  has  received  a  judicial  con- 
struction depriving  it  of  much  of  its  efficiency,  and  we  favor  the  enact- 
ment of  legislation  which  will  restore  to  the  statute  the  strength  of 
which  it  has  been  deprived  by  such  interpretation. 

EIGHTS    OF   THE   STATES. 

We  believe  in  the  preservation  and  maintenance  in  their  full  strength 
and  integritv  of  the  three  co-ordinate  branches  of  the  Federal  govern- 
ment— the  executive,  the  legislative,  and  the  judicial — each  keeping 
within  its  own  bounds  and  not  encroaching  upon  the  just  powers  of 
either  of  the  others. 

Believing  that  the  most  efficient  results  under  our  system  of  govern- 
ment are  to  be  attained  by  the  full  exercise  by  the  States  of  their  re- 
served sovereign  powers,  we  denounce  as  usurpation  the  efforts  of  our 
opponents  to  deprive  the  States  of  any  of  the  rights  reserved  to  them, 
and  to  enlarge  and  magnify  by  indirection  the  powers  of  the  Federal 
government. 

We  insist  upon  the  full  exercise  of  all  the  powers  of  the  government, 
both  State  and  national,  to  protect  the  people  from  injustice  at  the  hands 
of  those  who  seek  to  make  the  government  a  private  asset  in  business. 
There  is  no  twilight  zone  between  the  nation  and  the  State  in  which 
exploiting  interests  can  take  refuge  from  both.  It  is  as  necessary  that 
the  Federal  government  shall  exercise  the  powers  delegated  to  it  as  it  is 
thai  the  States  shall  exercise  the  powers  reserved  to  them,  but  we  insist 
that  Federal  remedies  for  the  regulation  of  interstate  commerce  and  for 
the  prevention  of  private  monopoly,  shall  be  added  to,  and  not  substi- 
tuted for,  State  remedies. 

INCOME   TAX   AND    POPULAR   ELECTION    OF    SENATORS.  \ 

We  congratulate*  the  country  upon  the  triumph  of  two  important 
reforms  demanded  in  the  last  national  platform,  namely,  the  amendment 
id'  the  Federal  Constitution  authorizing  ar  income  tax.  and  the  amend-  / 


368  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

/  ment  providing  for  the  popular  election  of  senators,  and  we  call  upou 
[  the  people  of  all  the  States  to  rally  to  the  support  of  the  pending  propo- 
V  sitions  and  secure  their  ratification. 

^ —  "We  note  with  gratification  the  unanimous  sentiment  in  favor  of  pub- 
licity, before  the  election,  of  campaign  contributions — a  measure  de 
manded  in  our  national  platform  of  1908,  and  at  that  time  opposed  by 
the  Eepublican  party — and  we  commend  the  Democratic  House  of  Rep- 
resentatives for  extending  the  doctrine  of  publicity  to  recommendations, 
verbal  and  written,  upon  which  presidential  appointments  are  made,  to 
the  ownership  and  control-of  newspapers,  and  to  the  expenditures  made 
by  and  in  behalf  of  those  who  aspire  to  presidential  nominations,  aad 
we  point  for  additional  justification  for  this  legislation  to  the  enormous 
expenditures  of  money  in  behalf  of  the  President  and  his  predecessor  in 
the  recent  contest  for  the  Bepublican  nomination  for  President. 

PRESIDENTIAL   PRIMARY. 

The  movement  towards  more  popular  government  should  be  promoted 
through  legislation  in  each  State  which  will  permit  the  expression  of 
the  preference  of  the  electors  for  national  candidates  at  presidential 
j'riwarier. 

"We  direct  that  the  National  Committee  incorporate  in  the  call  for 
the  next  nominating  convention  a  requirement  that  all  expressions  of 
preference  for  Presidential  candidates  shall  be  given  and  the  selection 
of  delegates  and  alternates  made  through  a  primary  election  conducted 
by  the  party  organization  in  each  State  where  such  expression  and  elec- 
tion are  not  provided  for  by  State  law.  'Committeemen  who  are  here- 
after to  constitute  the  membership  of  the  Democratic  National  Com- 
Vmittee,  and  whose  election  is  not  provided  for  by  law,  shall  be  chosen 
in  each  State  at  such  primary  elections,  and  the  service  and  authority 
of  committeemen,  however  'chosen,  shall  begin  immediately  upon  the 
receipt  of  their  credentials,  respectively. 

CAMPAIGN    CONTRIBUTIONS. 

We  pledge  the  Democratic  party  to  the  enactment  of  a  law  prohibit- 
ing any  corporation  from  contributing  to  a  campaign  fund  and  any 
individual  from  contributing  any  amount  above  a  reasonable  maximum. 

TRKlt   OF   PRESIDENT. 

We  favor  a  single  Presidential  term,  and  to  that  end  urge  the  adop- 
tion of  an  amendment  to  the  Constitution  making  the  President  of  the 
United  States  ineligible  to  reelection,  and  we  pledge  the  candidate  c  f 
this  Convention  to  this  principle. 

DEMOCRATIC    CONGRESS. 

At  this  time,  when  the  Republican  party  after  a  generation  of 
unlimited  power  in  its  control  of  the  Federal  Government,  is  rent  into 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  369 

factions,  it  is  opportune  to  point  to  the  record  of  accomplishment  of  the 
Democratic  House  of  Representatives  in  the  Sixty-second  Congress.  We 
indorse  its  action  and  we  challenge  comparison  of  its  record  with  that 
of  any  Congress  which  has  been  controlled  by  our  opponents. 

We  call  the  attention  of  the  patriotic  citizens  of  our  country  to  its 
record  of  efficiency,  economy  and  constructive  legislation. 

It  has,  among  other  achievements,  revised  the  rules  of  the  House  of 
Representatives  so  as  to  give  to  the  representatives  of  the  American 
people  freedom  of  speech  and  of  action  in  advocating,  proposing  and 
perfecting  remedial  legislation. 

It  has  passed  bills  for  the  relief  of  the  people  and  the  development 
of  our  country ;  it  has  endeavored  to  revise  the  tariff  taxes  downward  in 
the  interest  of  the  consuming  masses,  and  thus  to  reduce  the  high  cost  of 
living. 

It  has  proposed  an  amendment  to  the  Federal  Constitution  providing 
for  the  election  of  United  States  Senators  by  the  direct  vote  of  the 
people. 

It  has  secured  the  admission  of  Arizona  and  New  Mexico  as  two  sov- 
ereign States. 

It  has  required  the  publicity  of  campaign  expenses  both  before  ant? 
after  election  and  fixed  a  limit  upon  the  election  expenses  of  United 
States  Senators  and  Representatives. 

It  has  passed  a  bill  to  prevent  the  abuse  of  the  writ  of  injunction. 

It  has  passed  a  law  establishing  an  eight-hour  day  for  workmen  on 
all  national  public  work. 

It  has  passed  a  resolution  which"  forced  the  President  to  take  im- 
mediate steps  to  abrogate  the  Russian  treaty. 

And  it  has  passed  the  great  supply  bills  which  lessen  waste  and 
extravagance,  and  which  reduce  the  annual  expenses  of  the  government 
by  many  millions  of  dollars. 

We  approve  the  measure  reported  by  the  Democratic  leaders  in  the 
House  of  Representatives  for  the  creation  of  a  council  of  national 
defense,  which  will  determine  a  definite  naval  program  with  a  view  to 
increased  efficiency  and  economy.  The  party  that  proclaimed  and  has 
always  enforced  the  Monroe  doctrine,  and  was  sponsor  for  the  new  navy, 
will  continue  faithfully  to  observe  the  constitutional  requirements  to 
provide  and  maintain  an  adequate  and  well-proportioned  navy  sufficient 
to  defend  American  policies,  protect  our  citizens,  and  uphold  the  honor 
and  dignity  of  the  nation. 

REPUBLICAN    EXTRAVAGANCE. 

We  denounce  the  profligate  waste  of  the  money  wrung  from  the 
people  by  oppressive  taxation  through  the  lavish  appropriations  of  recent 
Republican  Congresses,  which  have  kept  taxes  high,  and  reduced  the 
purchasing  power  of  the  people's  toil.  We  demand  a  return  to  that 
simplicity  and  economy  which  befits  a  Democratic  government,  and  a 


OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

reduction  in  the  number  of  useless  offices,  the  salaries  of  which  drain 
the  substance  of  the  people. 

RAILROADS,  EXPRESS   COMPANIES.   TELEGRAPH   AND  TELEPHONE  LINES.    * 

We  favor  the  efficient  supervision  and  rate  regulation  of  railroads, 
express  companies,  telegraph  and  telephone  lines  engaged  in  interstate 
commerce.  To  this  end  we  recommend  the  valuation  of  railroads,  express 
companies,  telegraph  and  telephone  lines  by  the  Interstate  Commerce 
Commission,  such  valuation  to  take  into  consideration  the  physical  value 
of  the  property,  the  original  cost,  the  cost  of  reproduction,  and  any 
element  of  value  that  will  render  the  valuation  fair  and  just. 

We  favor  such  legislation  as  will  effectually  prohibit  the  railroads, 
express,  telegraph  and  telephone  companies  from  engaging  in  business 
which  brings  them  into  competition  with  their  shippers  or  patrons;  also 
legislation  preventing  the  overissue  of  stocks  and  bonds  by  interstate 
railroads,  express  companies,  telegraph  and  telephone  lines,  and  legis- 
lation which  will  assure  such  reduction  in  transportation  rates  as  con- 
ditions will  permit,  care  being  taken  to  avoid  reduction  that  would  com- 
pel a  reduction  of  wages,  prevent  adequate  service,  or  do  injustice  to 
legitimate  investments. 

BANKING    LEGISLATION. 

We  oppose  the  so-called  Aldrich  bill  or  the  establishment  of  a  central 
bank;  and  we  believe  our  country  will  be  largely  freed  from  panics  and 
consequent  unemployment  and  business  depression  by  such  a  systematic 
revision  of  our  banking  laws  as  will  render  temporary  relief  in  localities 
where  such  relief  is  needed,  with  protection  from  control  or  dominion  by 
what  is  known  as  the  money  trust. 

Banks  exist  for  the  accommodation  of  the  public,  and  not  for  the 
control  of  business.  All  legislation  on  the  subject  of  banking  and  cur- 
rency should  have  for  its  purpose  the  securing  of  these  accommodations 
on  terms  of  absolute  security  to  the  public  and  of  complete  protection 
from  the  misuse  of  the  power  that  wealth  gives  to  those  who  possess  it. 

We  condemn  the  present  methods  of  depositing  government  funds 
in  a  few  favored  banks,  largely  situated  in  or  controlled  by  Wall  Street, 
in  return  for  political  favors,  and  we  pledge  our  party  to  provide  by  la^v 
for  their  deposit  by  competitive  bidding  in  the  banking  institutions  of 
the  country,  national  and  State,  without  discrimination  as  to  locality. 
upon  approved  securities  and  subject  to  call  by  the  Government. 

RURAL    CREDITS. 

Of  equal  importance  with  the  question  of  currency  reform  is  the 
question  of  rural  credits  or  agricultural  finance.  Therefore,  we  recom- 
mend that  an  investigation  of  agricultural  credit  societies  in  foreign 
countries  be  made,  so  that  it  may  be  ascertained  whether  a  system  of 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  371 

rural  credits  may  be  devised  suitable  to  conditions  in  the  United  States; 
and  we  also  favor  legislation  permitting  national  banks  to  loan  a 
n-asonable  proportion  of  their  funds  on  real  estate  security. 

We  recognize  the  value  of  vocational  education,  and  urge  Federal 
appropriations  for  such  training  and  extension  teaching  in  agriculture 
in  cooperation  with  the  several  States. 

WATERWAYS. 

We  renew  the  declaration  in  our  last  platform  relating  to  the  con- 
servation of  our  natural  resources  and  the  development  of  our  water- 
ways. The  present  devastation  of  the  lower  Mississippi  valley  ac- 
centuates the  movement  for  the  regulation  of  river  flow  by  additional 
bank  and  levee  protection  below,  and  the  diversion,  storage  and  control 
of  the  flood  waters  above,  and  their  utilization  for  beneficial  purposes 
in  the  reclamation  of  arid  and  swamp  lands  and  the  development  of 
water  power,  instead  of  permitting  the  floods  to  continue,  as  heretofore, 
;i gents  of  destruction. 

\\V  hold  that  the  control  of  the  Mississippi  Kiver  is  a  national  prob- 
lem. The  preservation  of  the  depth  of  its  water  for  the  purpose  of 
navigation,  the  building  of  levees  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  its  chan- 
nel, and  the  prevention  of  the  overflow  of  the  land  and  its  consequent 
devastation,  resulting  in  the  interruption  of  interstate  commerce,  the 
disorganization  of  the  mail  service,  and  the  enormous  loss  of  life  and 
property,  impose  an  obligation  which  alone  can  be  discharged  by  the 
general  government. 

To  maintain  an  adequate  depth  of  water  the  entire  year,  and  thereby 
encourage  water  transportation,  is  a  consummation  worthy  of  legislative 
attention,  and  presents  an  issue  national  in  its  character.  It  calls  for 
prompt  action  on  the  part  of  Congress,  and  the  Democratic  party  pledges 
itself  to  the  enactment  of  legislation  leading  to  that  end. 

\Vi&gt;  favor  the  cooperation  of  the  United  States  and  the  respective 
States  in  plans  for  the  comprehensive  treatment  of  all  waterways  with 
a  view  of  coordinating  plans  for  channel  improvement,  with  plans  for 
drainage  of  swamp  and  overflowed  lands,  and  to  this  end  we  favor  the 
appropriation  by  the  Federal  Government  of  sufficient  funds  to  make 
surveys  of  such  lands,  to  develop  plans  for  draining  the  same,  and  to 
supervise  the  work  of  construction. 

We  favor  the  adoption  of  a  liberal  and  comprehensive  plan  for  the 
development  and  improvement  of  our  inland  waterways,  with  economy 
and  eilicieiicy.  so  as  to  permit  their  navigation  by  vessels  of  standard 
draft. 

POSTROADS. 

We  favor  national  aid  to  State  and  local  authorities  in  the  construe 
tion  and  maintenance  of  poetroads. 


372  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

RIGHTS  OF  LABOR. 

We  repeat  our  declarations  of  the  platform  of  1903.  as  follow?: 

"The  courts  of  justice  are  the  bulwark  of  our  liberties,  and  we 
yield  to  none  in  our  purpose  to  maintain  their  dignity.  Our  party  Has 
given  to  the  bench  a  long  line  of  distinguished  justices,  who  have  added 
to  the  respect  and  confidence  in  which  this  department  must  be  jealously 
maintained.  We  resent  the  attempt  of  the  Republican  party  to  raise 
a  false  issue  respecting  the  judiciary.  It  is  an  unjust  reflection  upon 
a  great  body  of  our  citizens  to  assume  that  they  lack  respect  for  the 
courts. 

"It  is  the  function  of  the  courts  to  interpret  the  laws  which  the 
people  enact,  and  if  the  laws  appear  to  work  economic,  social  or  political 
injustice,  it  is  our  duty  to  change  them.  The  only  basis  upon  which 
the  integrity  of  our  courts  can  stand  is  that  of  unswerving  justice  and 
protection  of  life,  personal  liberty,  and  property.  As  judicial  processes 
may  be  abused,  we  should  guard  them  against  abuse. 

' '  Experience  has  proven  the  necessity  of  a  modification  of  the  present 
law  relating  to  injunction,  and  we  reiterate  the  pledges  of  our  platforms 
of  1896  and  1904  in  favor  of  a  message  which  passed  the  United  States 
Senate  in  1896,  relating  to  contempt  in  Federal  courts,  and  providing 
for  trial  by  jury  in  cases  of  indirect  contempt. 

••Questions  of  judicial  practice  have  arisen,  especially  in  connection 
with  industrial  disputes.  We  believe  that  the  parties  to  all  judicial  pro- 
ceedings should  be  treated  with  rigid  impartiality,  and  that  injunctions 
should  not  be  issued  in  any  case  in  which  an  injunction  would  not  issue 
if  no  industrial  disputes  were  involved. 

"The  expanding  organization  of  industry  makes  it  essential  that 
there  should  be  no  abridgement  of  the  right  of  the  wage  earners  and 
producers  to  organize  for  the  protection  of  wages  and  the  improvement 
of 'labor  conditions,  to  the  end  that  such  la,bor  organizations  and  their 
members  should  not  be  regarded  as  illegal  combinations  in  restraint  of 
trade. 

••  We  pledge  the  Democratic  party  to  the  enactment  of  a  law  creating 
a  derartir.ent  of  labor,  represented  separately  in  the  President's  cabinet, 
in  which  department  sball  be  included  the  subject  of  mines  and  mining."" 

\\Y  pledg?  the  Democratic  party,  so  far  as  the  Federal  jurisdiction 
extends,  to  an  employes'  compensation  law  providing  adequate  indemnity 
for  injury  to  l-rdy  or  Io -s  of  life. 

KRVATION. 

We  believe  in  the  conservation  and  the  development,  for  the  use  of 
all  the  people,  of  the  natural  resources  of  the  country.     Our  forests,  our 
s^urres  of  water  supply,  our  arable  and  our  mineral  lands,  our  navigable 
:&gt;nd   all   the  other   materhl   re-wir.-os   with   which   our   country 
1  "-   been  so  I.  constitute  the  foundation  of  our  national 

Sutu  additional  legislation  as  may  be  necessary  to  prevent  their

being  \vMst (  (1  or  absorbed  by  special  or  privileged  interests,  should  bs 
enact ed  and  the  policy  of  their  conservation  should  be  rigidly  adhered  to. 

Tho  public  domain  should  be  administered  and  disposed  of  with  due 
regard  to  the  general  welfare.  Reservations  should  be  limited  to  the 
purposes  \\liich  they  purport  to  serve  and  not  extended  to  include  lands 
•  wholly  unsuited  therefor.  The  unnecessary  withdrawal  from  sale  and 
settlement  of  enormous  tracts  of  public  land,  upon  which  tree  growth 
never  existed  and  cannot  be  promoted,  tends  only  to  retard  development, 
circle  discontent,  and  bring  reproach  upon  the  policy  of  conservation. 

The  public  land  laws  should  be  administered  in  a  spirit  of  the  broad- 
est liberality  towards  the  settler  exhibiting  a  bona  fide  purpose  to  comply 
therewith,  to  the  end  that  the  invitation  of  this  government  to  the 
landless  should  be  as  attractive  as  possible;  and  the  plain  provisions  of 
the  forest  reserve  act  permitting  homestead  entries  to  be  made  within 
the  national  forests  should  not  be  nullified  by  administrative  regulations 
which  amount  to  a  withdrawal  of  great  areas  of  the  same  from  settle- 
ment. 

Immediate  action  should  be  taken  by  Congress  to  make  available  the 
vast  and  valuable  coal  deposits  of  Alaska  under  conditions  that  will 
be  a  perfect  guaranty  against  their  falling  into  the  hands  of  monopoliz- 
ing corporations,  associations  or  interests. 

W  rejoice  in  the  inheritance  of  mineral  resources  unequaled  in 
extent,  variety,  or  value,  and  in  the  development  of  a  mining  industry 
unequaled  in  its  magnitude  and  importance.  We  honor  the  men  who, 
in  their  hazardous  toil  underground,  daily  ris"k  their  lives  in  extracting 
and  preparing  for  our  use  the  products  of  the  mine,  so  essential  to  the 
industries,  the  commerce,  and  the  comfort  of  the  people  of  this  country. 
And  we  pledge  ourselves  to  the  extension  of  the  work  of  the  bureau 
of  mines  in  every  way  appropriate  for  national  legislation  with  a  view 
of  safeguarding  the  lives  of  the  miners,  lessening  the  waste  of  essential 

•  urces,  and  promoting  the  economic  development  of  mining,  which, 
along  with  agriculture,  must  in  the  future,  even  more  than  in  the 
past,  serve  as  the  very  foundation  of  our.  national  prosperity  and  wel- 
fare, and  our  international  commerce. 

AGRICULTURE. 

We  believe  in  encouraging  the  development  of  a  modern  system  of 
agriculture  and  a  systematic  effort  to  improve  the  conditions  of  trade 
in  farm  products  so  as  to  benefit  "Both  the  consumers  and  producers. 
And  as  an  efficient  means  to  this  end,  we  favor  the  enactment  by  Con- 
gress of  legislation  that  will  suppress  the  pernicious  practice  of 
gambling  in  agricultural  products  by  organized  exchanges  or  others. 

MERCHANT    MARINE. 

We  believe  in  fostering,  by  constitutional  regulation  of  commerce, 
the  growth  of  a  merchant  marine,  which  shall  develop  and  strengthen 


374  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

the  commercial  ties  which  bind  us  to  our  sister  republics  of  the  South, 
but  without  imposing  additional  burdens  upon  the  people  and  without 
bounties  or  subsidies  from  the  public  treasury.  .  , 

We  urge  upon  Congress  the  speedy  enactment  of  laws  for  the 
greater  security  of  life  and  property  at  sea;  and  we  favor  the  repeal 
of  all  laws,  and  the  abrogation  of  so  much  of  our  treaties  with  other 
nations,  as  provide  for  the  arrest  and  imprisonment  of  seamen  charged 
with  desertion,  or  with  violation  of  their  contract  of  service.  Such 
laws  and  treaties  are  un-American,  and  violate  the  spirit,  if  not  the 
letter,  of  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States. 

We  favor  the  exemption  from  tolls  of  American  ships  engaged  in 
coastwise  trade  passing  through  the  Panama  canal. 

We  also  favor  legislation  forbidding  the  use  of  the  Panama  Canal 
by  ships  owned  or  controlled  by  railroad  carriers  engaged '  in  trans- 
portation competitive  with  the  canal. 

PURE    FOOD    AND    PUBLIC    HEALTH. 

We  reaffirm  our  previous  declarations  advocating  the  union  and 
strengthening  of  the  various  governmental  agencies  relating  to  pure 
foods,  quarantine,  vital  statistics  and  human  health.  Thus  united,  and 
administered  without  partiality  to  or  discrimination  against  any  school 
of  medicine  or  system  of  healing,  they  would  constitute  a  single  health 
service,  not  subordinated  to  any  commercial  or  financial  interests,  but 
devoted  exclusively  to  the  conservation  of  human  life  and  efficiency. 
Moreover,  this  health  service  should  cooperate  with  the  health  agencies 
of  our  various  States  and  cities,  without  interference  with  their  preroga- 
tives, or  with  the  freedom  of  individuals  to  employ  such  medical  or 
hygienic  aid  as  they  may  see  fit. 

CIVIL     SERVICE    LAW. 

.  The  law  pertaining  to  the  civil  service  should  be  honestly  and  rigidly 
enforced,  to  the  end  that  merit  and  ability  shall  be  the  standard  of 
appointment  and  promotion,  rather  than  service  rendered  to  a  political 
party;  and  we  favor  a  reorganization  of  the  civil  service,  with  adequate 
compensation  commensurate  with  the  class  of  work  performed,  for  all 
officers  and  employes;  we  also  favor  the  extension  to  all  classes  of 
civil  service  employes  of  the  benefits  of  the  provisions  of  the  employ- 
ers' liability  law;  we  also  recognize  the  right  of  direct  petition  to 
Congress  by  .employes  for  the  redress  of  grievance. 

LAW   REFORM. 

We  recognize  the  urgent  need  of  reform  in  the  administration  of 
civil  and  criminal  law  in  the  United  States,  and  we  recommend  the 
enactment  of  such  legislation  and  the  promotion  of  such  measures  as 
will  rid  the  present  legal  system  of  the  delays,  expense,  and  uncertain- 
ties incident  to  the  system  as  now  administered. 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  375 

THE    PHILIPPINES. 

We  reaffirm  the  position  thrice  announced  by  the  Democracy  in 
national  convention  assembled  against  a  policy  of  imperialism  and 
colonial  exploitation  in  the  Philippines  or  elsewhere.  We  condemn  the 
experiment  in  imperialism  as  an  inexcusable  blunder,  which  has  in- 
volved us  in  enormous  expense,  brought  us  weakness  instead  of  strength, 
and  laid  our  nation  open  to  the  cha»ge  of  abandonment  of  the  funda- 
mental doctrine  of  self  government.  We  favor  an  immediate  declara- 
tion of  the  nation 's  purpose  to  recognize  the  independence  of  the 
Philippine  Islands  as  soon  as  a  stable  government  can  be  established, 
such  independence  to  be  guaranteed  by  us  until  the  neutralization  of 
the  islands  can  be  secured  by  treaty  with  other  powers. 

In  recognizing  the  independence  of  the  Philippines,  our  government 
should  retain  such  land  as  may  be  necessary  for  coaling  stations  and 
naval  bases. 

ARIZONA   AND    NEW    MEXICO. 

We  welcome  Arizona  and  New  Mexico  to  the  sisterhood  of  States 
and  heartily  congratulate  them  upon  their  auspicious  beginning  of 
great  and  glorious  careers. 

ALASKA. 

We  demand  for  the  people  of  Alaska  the  full  enjoyment  of  the 
rights  and  privileges  of  a  Territorial  form  of  government,  and  we 
believe  that  the  officials  appointed  to  administer  the  government  of 
all  our  Territories  and  the  District  of  Columbia  should  be  qualified 
by-previous  bona  fide  residence. 

THE   RUSSIAN    TREATY. 

We  commend  the  patriotism  of  the  Democratic  members  of  the 
Senate  'and  House  of  Representatives  which  compelled  the  termination 
of  the  Russian  treaty  of  1832.  and  we  pledge  ourselves  anew  to  preserve 
%the  sacred  rights  of  American  citizenship  at  home  and  abroad.  No 
treaty  should  receive  the  sanction  of  our  government  which  does  not 
recognize  that  equality  of  all  of  our  citizens,  irrespective  of  race  or 
creed,  and  which  does  not  expressly  guarantee  the  fundamental  right 
of  expatriation. 

The  constitutional  rights  of  American  citizens  should  protect  them 
on  our  borders,  and  go  with  them  throughout  the  world,  and  every 
American  citizen  residing  or  having  property  in  any  foreign  country 
is  entitled  to  and  must  be  given  the  full  protection  of  the  United 
States  government,  both  for  himself  and  his  property. 

PARCELS    POST   AND   RURAL   DELIVERY. 

\\V  favor  the  establishment  of  a  parcels  post  or  postal  express,  and 
also  the  extension  of  the  rural  delivery  system  as  rapidly  as  practicable. 


376  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  TIIK 

PANAMA   CANAL   EXPOSITION. 

We  hereby  express  our  deep  interest  in  the  great  Panama  Canal 
Exposition  to  be  held  in  San  Francisco  in  1915,  and  favor  such  encour- 
agement as  can  be  properly  given. 

PROTECTION   OP   NATIONAL   UNIFORM. 

We  commend  to  the  several  States  the  adoption  of  a  law  making  it 
an  offense  for  the  proprietors  of  places  of  public  .amusement  and 
entertainment  to  discriminate  against  the  uniform  of  the  United  States, 
similar  to  the  law  passed  by  the  Congress  applicable  to  the  District 
of  Columbia  and  the  Territories  in  1911. 

PENSIONS. 

We  renew  the  declaration  of  our  last  platform  relating  to  a  generous 
pension  policy. 

RULE   OF   THE   PEOPLE. 

We  direct  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  Democratic  party's  demand 
for  a  return  to  the  rule  of  the  people  expressed  in  the  national  platform 
four  years  ago  has  now  become  the  accepted  doctrine  of  a  large 
majority  of  the  electors.  We  again  remind  the  country  that  only  by 
a  larger  exercise  of  the  reserved  power  of  the  people  can  they  protect 
themselves  from  the  misuse  of  delegated  power  and  the  usurpation 
of  governmental  instrumentalities  by  special  interests.  For  this  reason, 
the  National  Convention  insisted  on  the  overthrow  of  Cannonism  and 
the  inauguration  of  a  system  by  which  United  States  senators  could 
be  elected  by  direct  vote.  The  Democratic  party  offers  itself  to  the 
country  as  an  agency  through  which  the  complete  overthrow  and  extirpa- 
tion of  corruption,  fraud,  and  machine  rule  in  American  politics  can 
be  effected. 

CONCLUSION. 

Our  platform  is  one  of  principles  which  we  believe  to  be  essentiaV 
to  our  national  welfare.  Our  pledges  are  made  to  be  kept  when  in 
office,  as  well  as  relied  upon  during  the  campaign,  and  we  invite  the 
cooperation  of  all  citizens,  regardless  of  party,  who  believe  in  main- 
taining unimpaired  the  institutions  and  traditions  of  our  country. 

[The  reading  of  the  report  of  the  Committee  on  Eesolutions  was 
frequently  interrupted  by  applause.] 

MR.  KERN,  of  Indiana:  Mr.  Chairman,  on  behalf  of  the  Committee 
on  Resolutions,  I  move  the  adoption  of  this  platform. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  William  Hughes,  of  New  Jersey,  in 
the  Chair)  :  The  Senator  from  Indiana  moves  the  adoption  of  tlie 
report  of  the  Committee  on  Resolutions. 

The  motion  was  unanimously  agreed  to.

MR.  ALEX  D.  PITTS,  of  Alabama:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  demand  the 
regular  order. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN  :  The  regular  order  is  the  calling  of  the 
roll  of  States  for  the  presentation  of  candidates  for  Vice-President. 
The  Secretary  will  resume  the  call  of  the  roll.

REMARKS  OF  EDMUND  C.  SHIELDS. 

MR.  EDMUND  C.  SHIELDS,  of  Michigan  (when  the  State  of  Michigan 
was  called) :'  Mr.  Chairman  and  gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  in  behalf 
of  a  neighboring  State,  we  want  to  second  the  nomination  of  a  man 
who  we  know  is  able  and  constant,  and  who  will  make  a  most  enthusi- 
astic campaigner  for  the  Democracy.  We  second  the  nomination  of  our 
neighbor,  Hon.  Thomas  R.  Marshall,  of  Indiana.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  A.  C.  WEISS,  of  Minnesota  (when  the  State  of  Minnesota  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  Senator  Stockwell  of  our  delegation  will  speak 
for  Minnesota. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  John  F.  Fitzgerald,  of  Massachusetts, 
in  the  Chair)  :  The  Convention  will  now  hear  from  Mr.  Stockwell,  of 
Minnesota. 

REMARKS  OF  S.  A.  STOCKWELL. 

MR.  S.  A.  STOCKWELL,  of  Minnesota :  Mr.  Chairman,  ladies  of 
California,  Colorado  and  Washington,  and  gentlemen  of  the  Convention, 
I  think  few  members  of  this  Convention  will  agree  with  the  distinguished 
Senator  from  Alabama  (Mr.  Bankhead)  that  anyone  can  be  Vice- 
President.  We  should  select  as  our  candidate  for  Vice- President  at 
this  time  a  man  of  presidential  size.  Life  hangs  by  a  thread,  and  we 
want  a  man  who  can  take  up  the  responsible  duties  of  the  Presidency 
in  the  event  of  the  death  of  the  President.  [Applause.]  The  man 
whom  I  shall  second  has  these  qualifications.  I  second  the  nomination 
of  Hon.  John  Burke,  of  North  Dakota.  [Applause.] 

When  he  was  elected  chief  executive  of  that  great  State,  he  found 
a  State  government  that  was  practically  the  private  preserve  of  Alex. 
McKenzie  and  his  supporters.  Today  North  Dakota  is  one  of  the  best 
governed  States  in  this  Union.  She  has  the  finest  public  school  system, 
she  has  institutions  that  are  second  to  none,  due  to  the  splendid  work 
of  John  Burke.  On  behalf  of  the  24  votes  of  Minnesota,  her  sister 
State,  we  second  the  nomination  of  John  Burke.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll.

John  Burke.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  C.  J.  SMITH,  of  Nebraska  (when  the  State  of  Nebraska  was 
called)  rose. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  Gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  the  Chair 
presents  Mr.  C.  J.  Smith,  of  Nebraska. 

REMARKS  OF  CONSTANTIXE  J.  SMITH. 

MR.  COXSTAXTIXE  J.  SMITH,  of  Nebraska:  Gentlemen  of  the  Con- 
vention, you  have  given  to  the  far  East  the  splendid-  prize  of  the 
Presidential  nomination.  The  Vice-Presidential  nomination  should  go 
to  another  part  of  the  country.  The  great  Northwest,  including  Iowa, 
Nebraska.  Minnesota,  the  Dakotas  and  even  down  into  Kansas,  consti- 
tutes the  hotbed  of  Kepublican  insurgency  and  progressiveness.  We 
can  appeal  with  success  to  that  portion  of  the  country.  Therefore 
I  rise  on  behalf  of  a  part  of  the  delegation  from  Nebraska  to  second 
the  nomination  of  that  splendid  type  of  his  race,  that  militant  Demo- 
cratic Governor,  John  Burke,  of  North  Dakota.'  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

REMARKS  OF  KEY  PITTMAN. 

MR.  KEY  PITTMAX,  of  Nevada  (when  the  State  of  Nevada  was 
called)  :  Nevada  seconds  the  nomination  of  Governor  Marshall,  of 
Indiana. 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

REMARKS  OF  CLARENCE  E.  CARR. 

MR.  CLARENCE  E.  CARR,  of  New  Hampshire  (when  the  State  of  New 
Hampshire  was  called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  New  Hampshire  has  no  candi- 
date to  offer,  and  no  language  with  which  to  delay  the  proceedings 
of  the  Convention,  but  will  give  eight  votes  to  Tom  Marshall,  of 
Indiana.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

REMARKS  OF  W.  H.  MURRAY. 

MR.  W.  II.  MURRAY,  of  Oklahoma  (when  the  State  of  Oklahoma  was 
called)  :  Mr.  Chairman,  on  behalf  of  one  unit  of  the  Oklahoma  delega- 
tion I  rise  to  second  the  nomination  of  a  gentleman  whose  record  is  in 
keeping  with  that  of  our  nominee  for  President,  whose  nomination  will 
give  to  the  Democratic  party  of  this  nation  a  ticket,  for  both  President 


OEMOCIJATIC  XATIOXAL  CONVENTION  379 

and  Vice-President,  which   will  stand  for  principle  and  for  progressive 
Democracy,  Hon.  John  Burke,  of  North  Dakota.     [Applause.] 

REMARKS  OF  E.  J.  GIDDINGS. 

MR.  E.  J.  GIDDIXGS,  of  Oklahoma:     Mr.  Chairman,  on  behalf  of  the* 
other    unit    from   Oklahoma    I    desire    to    differ    from    Mr.    Murray.      I 
second  the  nomination  of  Tom  Marshall,  of  Indiana.     [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (when  the  State  of  Oregon  was  called) : 
Judge  King,  of  Oregon,  will  now  address  the  Convention. 

NOMINATING  SPEECH  OF  WILL  R.  KING. 

MR.  WILL  R.  KING,  of  Oregon :  Mr.  Chairman,  ladies  and  gentlemen 
of  this  Convention,  as  one  of  the  delegates  from  Oregon  I  want  to 
remind  you  that  that  State  is  still  on  the  map.  I  agree  with  the 
gentleman  who  has  preceded  me  in  saying  that  the  nomination  of  a 
candidate  for  Vice-President  is  not  a  trivial  matter.  We  should  exercise 
the  same  degree  of  care,  although  we  need  not  take  as  much  time,  in 
nominating  a  candidate  for  Vice-President  as  in  nominating  a  candidate 
for  President.  And  I  desire  to  say,  gentlemen,  that  we  come  from 
a  State  which  is  one  of  the  first  progressive  States  in  this  Union, 
as  progress  is  interpreted  by  this  Convention. 

This  Convention  has  nominated  the  man  who  will  be  President  of 
the  United  States,  and  by  his  nomination  it  has  made  the  word  "pro- 
gressive" synonyms  with  the  word  "Democracy."  [Applause.] 

Gentlemen,  the  State  of  Oregon  was  one  of  the  first  to  take  an 
advanced  step  in  legislation,  one  of  the  first  to  adopt  the  primary  law, 
and  that  was  adopted  by  a  direct  vote  of  the  people  after  repeated 
attempts  to  secure  it  through  the  Legislature.  It  is  one  of  the  first 
States  to  have  a  preferential  law,  under  which  we  vote  for  our  selection 
for  Presidential  and  Vice  Presidential  candidates.  That  State  selected 
as  its  nominees  Woodrow  Wilson  for  President,  and  ex-Governor  and 
present  United  States  Senator  George  E.  Chamberlain  for  Vice- 
President.  I  therefore  present  to  you,  gentlemen,  fhe  name  of  United 
States  Senator  George  E.  Chamberlain,  of  Oregon.  [Applause.] 

Senator  Chamberlain  was  born  in  the  great  State  of  Mississippi. 
He  secured  his  education  in  Washington  and  Lee  universities  in  the 
State  of  Virginia.  He  has  spent  thirty  years  of  his  life  in  carrying 
out  the  advice  of  Horace  Greeley,  in  not  only  going  West,  but  staying 
\\Y-r.  While  there  he  has  never  gone  down  to  defeat.  He  is  in  a 
State  which  gave  40,000  Republican'  majority  for  Roosevelt,  yet  he 
was  elected  Governor  twice;  and  as  a  result  of  his  attempt  to  secure 
the  election  of  United  States  Senators  by  direct  vote  of  the  people, 
was  sent  from  that  Republican  State  to  the  United  States  Senate. 
[Applause.] 


380  OFFICIAL  PROCEEDINGS  OF  THE 

I  wish  to  say,  brother  delegates,  that  if  you  will  nominate  George  E. 
Chamberlain,  you  will  have  a  counterpart  of  Woodrow  Wilson. 
[Applause.]  You  will  have  a  type  of  a  progressive  Democrat  su'eh 
as  you  cannot  secure  elsewhere.  I  say  nothing  in  disrespect  to  any 
other  candidate,  but  if  you  are  going  West,  do  not  stop  this  side  of 
the  Rocky  Mountains.  [Applause.]  Go  to  the  Pacific  Coast.  Let 
Mississippi  join  with  Virginia,  and  Virginia  with  New  Jersey,  the 
Atlantic  Coast  with  the  Pacific,  nominate  George  E.  Chamberlain,  and 
it  will  insure  the  carrying  of  every  State  west  of  the  Great  Lakes. 
[Applause.] 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  Convention  will  now  listen  to  one 
of  the  greatest  statesman  of  the  present  generation,  Senator  Williams, 
of  Mississippi.  [Applause.] 

REMARKS  OF  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS. 

MR.  JOHN  SHARP  WILLIAMS,  of  Mississippi:  Mr  Chairman  and 
gentlemen  of  the  Convention,  in  the  name  and  in  behalf  and  by  the 
consent  of  the  State  of  Mississippi,  the  State  of  his  birth,  I  rise  to 
second  the  nomination  which  has  just  been  made.  [Applause.] 

Born  and  raised  in  the  State  of  Mississippi,  of  Southern  ancestry, 
his  father  in  the  Confederate  army,  twice  elected  Governor  of  a 
Republican  State  although  he  was  a  Mississippi  Democrat,  unem- 
broidered,  unf rilled  and  unismed;  once  elected  Senator  by  the  same 
Republican  State,  it  seems  to  me  he  would  unite  North,  South  and 
West,  and  we  already  have  the  East  represented  upon  the  ticket. 

I  thank  you  for  your  attention.     [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

REMARKS  OF  JOHN  J.  FITZGERALD. 

MR.' JOHN  J.  FITZGERALD,  of  Rhode  Island  (when  the  State  of  Rhode 
Island  was  called) :  Mr.  Chairman,  the  sovereign  State  of  Rhode  Island 
directs  me  to  notify  the  Convention  that  she  has  never  yet  made  a 
nomination  of  one  of  her  favorite  sons,  although  having  no  lack  of 
favorite  sons  who  are  qualified  for  the  position  of  Vice-President.  For 
the  purpose  of  facilitating  matters  and  in  order  to  prevent  a  deadlock, 
Rhode  Island  refuses  to  present  a  name  of  her  own  at  the  present  time, 
but  seconds  the  nomination  of  John  Burke,  of  North  Dakota. 
[Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (when  the  State  of  Texas  was  called) :  The 
Convention  will  now  give  its  attention  to  Congressman  Henry,  of  Texas. 
[Applause.] 

REMARKS  OF  ROBERT  L.  HENRY. 

MR.  ROBERT  L.  HENRY,  of  Texas:  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Democracy 
of  Texas  is  always  progressive,  and  by  a  vote  of  more  than  three  to 


DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  CONVENTION  381 

one  that  empire  State  gave  her  vote  in  this  Convention  to  the  next 
President  of  the  United  States,  Woodrow  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

We  are  still  progressive,  and  have  passed  through  a  great  contest 
in  this  country,  and  Texas  directs  me  to  cast  her  vote  on  this  occasion 
in  behalf  of  that  progressive  Democrat,  Hon.  John  Burke,  of  North 
Dakota.  [Applause.]  Place  him  upon  your  ticket  and  he  will  lend 
strength  to  the  distinguished  Governor  of  New  Jersey,  and  there  will 
be  nothing  to  explain.  Xo  man  in  this  country  can  assail  his  record 
or  his  Democracy  on  any  question.  Therefore  I  take  pleasure  in  second- 
ing the  nomination  of  Governor  Burke,  and  hope  to  see  this  Convention 
finish  its  work,  so  auspiciously  lirgmi,  by  placing  him  on  the  ticket 
with  Governor  Wilson.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resinned  the  calling  of  the  roll.

my  associates  in  the  Utah  delegation  I  have  the  honor  to  second  the 
nomination  of  Governor  Marshall,  of  Indiana.  [Applause.]  * 

The  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

REMARKS  OF  CLAUDE  A.  SWANSON. 

MR.  CLAUDE  A.  SWANSON,  of  Virginia  (when  the  State  of  Virginia

fitness  of  his  character  and  the  availability  of  his  location,  I  desire 
to  second  the  nomination  of  Governor  Marshall,  of  Indiana.  [Applause.j

MR.    Z.    R.    CHENEY,   of    Alaska    (when    Alaska    was   called)  :      Mr.

REMARKS  OF  ROBERT  E.  MATTINGLY. 

MR.  ROBERT  E.  MATTINGLY  (when  the  District  of  Columbia  was 
called)  :  Mr*  Chairman,  many  great  Democrats  have  been  mentioned 
to  this  magnificent  Convention,  but  the  greatest  of  all  has  not  been 
named.  *We  want  victory  with  Wilson  in  November  next,  and  whom- 
ever we  nominate,  I  now  predict  that  victory  will  be  ours;  but  in  order 
to  make  assurance  doubly  sure,  let  us  nomniate  for  Vice-President  that 
great  exponent  of  Democracy,  William  J.  Bryan,  of  Nebraska. 
[Applause.] 

REMARKS  OF  WILLIAM  J.  BRYAN. 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  BRYAN,  of  Nebraska:  Mr.  Chairman  and  members 
of  the  Convention,  you  have  been  so  generous  to  me  in  the  allowance 
of  time  that  I  had  not  expected  to  trespass  upon  your  patience  again; 
but  the  compliment  that  has  been  paid  me  by  the  gentleman  from 
the  District  of  Columbia  justifies,  I  hope,  a  word  in  the  form  of  a 
valedictory.  [Applause.] 

For  sixteen  years  I  have  been  a  fighting  man.  Performing  what 
I  regarded  as  a  public  duty  \  have  not  hesitated  to  speak  out  on  every 
public  question  which  was  before  the  people  of  the  nation  for  settle- 
ment; and  I  have  not  hesitated  to  arouse  the  hostility  and  the  enmity 
of  individuals  where  in  behalf  of  my  country  I  felt  it  my  duty  to  do 
so.  [Applause.]  I  have  never  advocated  any  man  except  with  glad- 
ness, and  I  have  never  opposed  any  man  except  in  sadness.  [Applause.] 
If  I  have  any  enemies  in  this  country,  those  who  are  my  enemies  have 
a  monopoly  of  hatred.  There  is  not  one  human  being  for  whom  I  feel 
a  hatred.  [Applause.]  Nor  is  there  one  American  citizen,  in  my 
own  party  or  any  other,  whom  I  would  oppose  for  anything,  unless 
I  believed  that  in  not  opposing  him  I  was  surrendering  the  interests 
of  my  country,  which  I  hold  above  any  person.  [Applause.] 

I  recognize  that  a  man  who  fights  must  carry  scars,  and  long 
before  this  campaign  commenced  I  decided  that  I  had  been  in  so 
many  battles  and  had  alienated  so  many,  that  my  party  ought  to  have 
the  leadership  of  some  one  who  had  not  thus  offended,  and  who  thus 
might  lead  with  greater  Ijppe  of  victory.  [Applause.] 

Tonight  I  come  with  joy  to  surrender  into  the  hands  of  the  one 
chosen  by  this  Convention  a  standard  which  I  have  carried  in  three 


J  &gt;OIOCKATIC  XATIOXAL  CONVENTION  383 

campaigns,  and  I  challenge  my  enemies  to  declare  that  it  has  ever 
been  lowered  in  the  face  of  the  enemy.  [Applause.] 

The  same  belief  that  led  me  to  prefer  another  for  the  Presidency, 
rather  than  to  be  the  candidate  myself,  leads  me  to  prefer  another 
rather  than  myself  to  be  a  candidate  for  Vice-President.  It  is  not 
bivause  the  Vice-Presidency  is  lower  in  importance  than  the  Presidency 
that  I  decline  it.  There  is  no  office  in  this  nation  so  low  that  I  would 
not  take  it  if  I  could  serve  my  country  by  so  doing.  [Applause.] 

I  believe  that  I  can  render  more  service  to  my  country  when  I  have 
not  the  embarrassment  of  a  nomination  and  have  not  the  suspicion 
»t  :i  selfish  interest  than  I  could  as  a  candidate;  and  your  candidates 
will  not  be  more  active  in  this  campaign  than  I  shall  be.  [Applause.] 
vices  are  at  the  command  of  the  party,  and  I  feel  a  relief  now 
that  the  burden  of  leadership  is  transferred  to  other  shoulders.  Having, 
in  this  Convention,  given  us  a  platform,  the  most  progressive  that  any 
party  of  any  size  has  ever  adopted,  and  having  given  us  a  candidate 
who  I  believe  will  appeal  not  only  to  Democratic  votes,  but  to  some 
three  or  four  million  Kepublicans  who  have  been  alienated  by  the 
policies  of  their  party,  there  is  but  one  thing  left  to  do,  and  that  is 
to  give  us  a  candidate  for  Vice-President  in  harmony  with  our  candidate 
for  President,  so  there  may  be  no  joint  debate  between  our  candidates. 
[Applause.] 

Therefore,  thanking  you  for  the  very  generous  treatment  I  have 
received  at  your  hands,  let  me  in  conclusion  second  the  nomination, 
not  of  one  man.  but  of  two  men.  Governor  Burke,  of  North  Dakota, 
and  Senator  Chamberlain,  of  Oregon.  [Applause.] 

The  Secretary  resumed  and  concluded  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  WILLIAM   KENNEDY,  of  Connecticut:     Mr.  Chairman 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  James  Thomas  Heflin,  of  Alabama, 
in  the  Chair)  :  For  what  purpose  does  the  gentleman  rise? 

MR.  KENNEDY,  of  Connecticut:  My  State  was  passed,  and  we  have 
a  right  to  second  the  nomination  of  a  candidate  here.  I  rise  for  the 
purpose  of  seconding  the  nomination  of  John  Burke.  Connecticut  went 
Democratic  in  1902,  and  it  will  go  Democratic  again  with  this  ticket, 
if  it  is  completed  in  this  way.  [Applause.] 

VOTE  FOK  CANDIDATE  FOR  VICE-PRESIDENT. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of  States, 
etc.,  for  the  purpose  of  casting  their  votes  for  Vice-President.  The

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  Xo  candidate  having  received  two  thirds 
of  the  votes  cast,  the  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  for  the  third  ballot. 

MR.  WILLIAM  HUGHES,  of  New  Jersey:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that 
the  nomination  of  Governor  Marshall  be  made  unanimous. 

MR.  S.  J.  DOYLE,  of  Xorth  Dakota:  Mr.  Chairman,  on  behalf  of  the 
delegation  from  Xorth  Dakota  I  desire  at  this  time  to  withdraw  the 
name  of  John  Burke  as  a  candidate  before  this  Convention  for  the 
office  of  Vice-President.  I  desire  to  say  we  have  made  the  best  fight 
we  could;  and  when  the  campaign  comes  next  fall  all  you  have  to  do 
is  to  call  on  John  Burke,  and  wherever  he  goes  he  will  get  Democratic 
votes.  [Applause.] 

We  believed  he  was  the  most  available  man  here;  the  Convention 
thought  differently,  and  bowing  to  the  rule  of  the  majority  we  second 
the  motion  to  make  the  nomination  of  Governor  Marshall  unanimous. 

MR.  WILL  B.  KING,  of  Oregon:  I  second  the  motion  to  make  the 
nomination  of  Governor  Marshall  unanimous. 

The  motion  was  tmanimoaaly  agreed  to. 

THE  PERMANENT  CHAIRMAN:  I  now  declare  Governor  Thomas  E. 
Marshall  to  be  the  unanimous  choice  of  this  Convention  for  Vice-President

and  people  of  Baltimore  for  their  magnificent  courtesy,  generosity  and

ment while  guests  of  the  beautiful  city  of  which  he  is  the  Chief

held,  Mr.  Grain  has  worked  unceasingly  to  provide  a  magnificent  Con- 
vention hall  for  the  Convention  and  in  direction  of  the  many  details

with  the  sub-committee  of  the  Democratic  National  Committee,  in  charge 
of  the  Convention,  and  the  sub  committee  had  but  to  suggest  to  Mr.

,  tion.  No  political  party  has  ever  before  assembled  in  a  Convention

of  the  delegates,  the  party  officials  and  the  general  public  were  as  near 
perfection  as  they  are  in  this  Convention;  and  the  one  man  to  whom  the

ments and  the  Convention  plans  in  general  is  Mr.  Robert  Grain,  of  Balti

APPENDIX 

.NOTIFICATION   ADDKE.SS  OF 
OLLIE  M.  JAMES,  OF  KENTUCKY. 

Delivered  at  Seagirt.  Xe\v  Jersey,  August  7th,  1912. 

Governor  Wilson:  The  Democracy  of  this  Kepublic,  assembled  in  Xa 
tional  Convention  at  Baltimore  on  June  25,  1912,  was  truly  representa- 
tive of  the  people  of  this  country.  They  represented  a  political  faith 
that  was  born  with  the  Government  itself  and  founded  by  the  one  who 
wrote  the  charter  of  our  freedom.  The  Democratic  party  has  lived 
through  all  the  years  since  then  to  see  the  parties  that  battled  against 
it  die  in  the  political  arena  in  which  they  fought.  And  now  we  behold 
the  Republican  party,  once  militant,  united  and  triumphant,  now  divided, 
torn  and  disheartened,  presenting  to  the  American  people  a  disappearing 
and  dissolving  view;  and  in  the  melancholy  reflection  of  its  leaders  we 
can  almost  hear  them  say,  "What  shall  it  profit  a  party  if  it  gain  all 
the  trusts  and  lose  the  common  people?" 

On  the  forty-sixth  ballot,  in  perhaps  the  most  memorable  and  epoch 
making  Convention  ever  held  in  our  political  history,  you  were  unani- 
mously nominated  for  President  by  the  Democratic  party  amid  great 
enthusiasm.  Xo  cry  of  a  fraud-controlled  Convention  was  heard,  no 
charge  of  theft-made  delegations  was  uttered,  no  bribery  of  delegates 
debauched  that  Convention,  no  con.bination  or  trade,  no  bosses'  mandate 
was  responsible  for  your  nomination.  But  it  came  to  you  as  untainted 
as  the  Nation's  honor;  it  was  the  imbonght  free  voice  and  will  of  the- 
people's  honestly  selected  delegates.  There  are  no  disgruntled  Demo- 
Balking  in  their  tents.  The  men  who  contended  against  you  for 
this  great  prize,  the  loftiest  political  station  in  the  world,  take  their  de- 
feat like  the  brave  and  seasoned-soldiers  they  are,  knowing  that  all  could 
not  achieve  it,  that  the  will  of  the  people  selected  you. 

The  Democratic  party  believes  that  you  possess  in  splendid  fullness 
those  great  attributes  of  constructive  genius,  inventive  intellect  and 
resistless  will  which  so  tvanscendantly  befit  you  for  the  great  undertaking 
for  which  your  party  hns  commissioned  you.  As  the  Democracy  has 
bestowed  upon  you  its  most  exalted  confidence  by  naming  you  for  the 
highest  office  in  the  gift  of  your  countrymen,  they  have  done  so  with  an 
abiding  faith  that  your  service  to  all  the  people  by  striving  for 

395 


396  APPENDIX 

equal  laws  and  equal  opportunities  and  in  justly  apportioning  their 
burdens  will  meet  in  full  and  rounded  measure  all  their  hopes  and 
expectations. 

The  principles  for  which  our  party  fought  and  for  which  we  fell 
in  the  last  campaigns  have  so  aroused  the  public  conscience,  so  touched 
the  popular  heart,  have  become  so  strong  with  the  masses  of  the  people 
that  they  have  drawn  to  the  support  of  the  Democratic  party  praetically 
all  unselfish  Americans  and  have  divided  into  irreconcilable  factions  the 
hitherto  victorious  Eepublican  party,  which  in  the  past  triumphed  by 
opposing  them.  The  Democratic  party  is  striving  to  give  to  all  the 
people  a  government  so  just  with  laws  so  righteous  that  monopoly 
can  find  no  hiding  place  and  oppression  no  haven  here,  one  that  will  make 
every  citizen  for  his  country  a  volunteer  and  every  home  a  fortress 
against  its  invaders. 

\Vc  want  to  approach  as  nearly  as  possible  to  that  ideal  individualism 
for  which  Kepublics  were  born,  where  the  fruit  of  every  man's  toil  can 
be  enjoyed  by  his  own  family  and  every  man's  labor  will  inure  to  his  own 
benefit.  The  safety  and  life  of  this  Government,  this  free  Bepublic, 
this  home  of  constitutional  liberty,  rests  at  last  not  in  its  marching 
armies,  nor  its  mighty  navy,  nor  in  its  great  wealth,  but  in  its  equal  laws, 
its  National  honor,  and  in  the  ever-living  truth  that  above  cottage,  hut 
and  palace  all  alike  the  aegis  of  the  Constitution  rests,  which  is  the 
spirit  of  justice,  the  greatest  attribute  of  God. 

Great  as  is  the  honor  of  being  President  of  this  splendid  Eepublic, 
yet  the  glory  is  not  in  the  office,  not  in  the  fame  of  having  held  it,  but 
in  the  service  rendered  to  the  people,  by  which  the  public  servant  is 
properly  judged  and  that  which  makes  immortal  the  names  of  those  who 
hold  it.  And  the  people  know  you  would  not  put  the  armor  on  if  you 
did  not  hope  and  believe  you  would  see  a  happier,  more  prosperous  and 
a  more  contented  people  when  you  take  it  off.  We  all  recognize  the 
mighty  task  in  front  of  you.  Sixteen  years  of  Eepublican  rule  have 
riveted  the  chains  of  monopoly,  special  privilege  and  greed  upon  every 
field  of  industrial  and  commercial  endeavor,  upon  every  market  place, 
upon  every  avenue  of  trade.  Trust  and  monopoly  walk  with 
arrogant  and  brutal  tread,  fixing  with  equal  insolence  and  oppression 
the  market  of  the  buyer  and  the  seller. 

The  Bepublican  party  has  taught  the  trusts  that  it  only  barks  and 
never  bites.  Their  prosecutions  against  these  outlaws  are  but  a  signal 
to  play  a  rising  market,  to  drive  higher  the  value  of  the  stocks  they 
own,  to  increase  the  prices  of  articles  that  they  sell,  and  to  grant  greater 
dividends  to  those  who  are  interested  in  them.  The  people  call  for  a 
President,  and  they  believe  they  have  found  him  in  you,  wl:&lt;&gt;  will  not 
al«.ne  proceed  in  chancery  against  these  men  who  defy  the  laws,  win, 
oppress  the  people,  who  drive  men.  women  and  children  1o  desperation  )..• 
i-'-asnn  of  hunger,  who  deny  them  the  necessaries  of  life  by  their  monopo- 
listic prices,  but  one  who  will  demand  that  the  stripes  of  the  felon 


AlTKNDIX  39? 

shall  lie  placed  upon  them,  one  who  will  give  a  vigorous  and  genuine 
democratic,  people 's-rule  enforcement  to  the  criminal  laws  against  male- 
factors of  great  wealth. 

It  will  take  a  giant  for  this  task,  a  hero's  heart,  a  soldier's  courage . 
Democracy  looked  this  Republic  over,  and  with  millions  to  choose  from, 
selected  you  as  the  man.  Xo  general  ever  commanded  in  a  greater  con- 
test, the  successful  outcome  of  which  will  be  prolific  of  so  much  good,  or 
failure  fraught  with  so  much  disaster.  The  people  will  be  with  you.  They 
are  going  to  give  you  a  Congress  in  sympathy  with  our  cause,  which  will 
stand  ready  to  aid  you  in  all  patriotic  endeavor.  Tie?  struggling  masses 
everywhere,  the  toilers  in  field,  simp  and  factory,  those  who  make  up  the 
great  electorate,  will  stand  with  you  in  this  contest. 

The  •  Democratic  party  is  the  friend  of  honest  business,  whether 
the  business  be  big  or  little,  and  is  striving  to  make  it  impossible  for 
criminal  business  to  destroy  legitimate  business  and  oppress  the  people. 

The  party  which  held  that  you  had  the  right  by  law  to  tax  all  the 
people  to  give  a  profit  to  the  favored  few,  which  was  the  utterance  of  the 
Republican  national  platform  in  1908,  undertook  to  put  in  operation  in 
their  Convention  system  the  same  principle  by  the  Committee  on  Creden- 
tials giving  a  majority  of  votes  to  one  of  the  candidates,  which  had  been 
taken  away  from  another  one,  in  order  that  he  might  profit  by  having  the 
nomination.  And  yet  some  of  those  who  have  been  playing  this  system 
for  the  benefit  of  the  special  and  favored  few  at  the  expense  of  the 
American  people  immediatelv  severed  their  connection  with  the  Repub- 
lican party  and  in  their  distress,  defeat  and  dismay  went  to  that  Book 
which  offers  a  remedy  for  every  wrong,  balm  for  every  sorrow,  and 
found  to  their  surprise  and  delight  a  commandment  uttered  centuries 
ago,  •'Thoii  shalt  not  steal."  This  is  not  new  doctrine  to  our  party. 

We  have  heard  it  and  demanded  its  application  long  ago,  not  only 
to  Conventions,  but  to  the  beneficiaries  of  Convention  platforms,  to  tariff 
taxes,  to  trusts  and  monopolies,  the  legitimate  offspring  of  the  protective 
tariff  system;  and  if  the  Republican  Convention  held  at  Chicago  had  no 
other  virtue  it  caused  some  of  the  participants  to  read  the  Ten  Command- 
ments. That  principle  which  has  divided  the  Republican  party  upon 
practical  application  in  Convention  proceedings  has  caused  the  American 
people  to  come  TO  flie  Democratic  party,  which  says:  "Thou  shalt  not 
steal  by  taxation,  thou  shalt  not  commission  trusts  and  monopolies  to 
steal  by  taxation.''  and  the  American  people  are  allying  themselves  as 
never  before  with  this  party  which  believes  that  a  tax  is  a  Governmental 
agency  and  can  be  used  only  for  Governmental  purposes  and  collected 
by  the  Government  itself,  and  not  farmed  out  to  favor-seeking  and 
special  privileged  classes.  The  American  people  demand  the  extirpation 
of  trusts  and  monopolies,  not  the  plucking  of  a  blossom  here  and  yonder, 
but  that  the  ax  shall  lie  laid  at  the  very  foot  of  the  tree  of  special 
privilege.  They  demand  the  application  of  a  just  system  of  taxation 
that  shall  meet  the  immediate  and  reasonable  demands  and  needs  of  the 


398  APPENDIX 

Government  administered  in  economy  and  honesty,  that  no  tax  shall  be 
laid  either  to  protect  monopoly  or  to  allow  them  to  plunder  the  people. 
And  in  answer  to  the  tariff,  trust-fed  barons,  who  are  demanding  that 
the  tariff  shall  be  taken  out  of  politics,  when,  they  have  secured  rates 
higher  than  ever  before,  hiding  behind  each  one  of  them  a  monopoly 
that  feeds  upon  labor 's  toil,  we  answer  and  say  we  will  take  the 
tariff  out  of  politics  when  they  take  their  larcenous  hands  out  of  the 
pockets  of  the  American  people. 

If  elected,  as  now  seems  assured,  it  is  our  hope  and  belief  that  your 
name  and  administration  will  be  embalmed  in  the  hearts  of  the  people 
and  that  history  may  record  the  great  truth  that  you  found  your  country 
ivith  all  the  avenues  of  commerce",  the  arteries  of  trade,  in  the  grasp 
of  vicious  monopoly,  and  that  you  left  it  free,  untrammeled,  unshackled 
by  law-protected  greed,  and  no  longer  dominated  by  privilege;  that  you, 
through  your  powerful  talents  and  great  genius,  cast  off  the  monopolies 
that  hold  chained  the  commerce  of  the  country ;  that  you  resisted  the 
desperate  stand  of  those  money-changers  and  did  so  in  triumph. 

A  former  President  charges  the  present  President  with  being  friendly 
with  certain  trusts  and  failure  to  prosecute  them;  the  present  President 
charges  the  former  President  with  being  friendly  with  certain  other 
trusts  and  failure  to  prosecute  them.  I  have  carefully  examined  the 
record  of  each  of  these  gentlemen  and  T  am  entirely  unable  to  find  any- 
thing upon  which  to  base  a  denial  of  either  of  their  statements.  What 
the  people  want,  what  they  demand,  is  a  President  who  will  enforce  the 
law  to  the  utmost  letter  and  prosecute  all  trusts;  not  one  who  is  friendly 
with  some  and  unfriendly  with  others,  but  a  President  friendly  to  the 
people  and  friendly  to  the  law  and  unfriendly  to  no  legitimate  business, 
one  who  will  draw  the  sword  of  justice  and  law  against  all  monopoly. 
For  they  know  the  cost  of  living  canrfot  be  reduced,  relief  cannot  come 
to  the  people  unless  monopoly  is  destroyed.  The  people  demand  some- 
thing more  than  a  President  who  is  friendly  with  the  good  trusts,  which 
usually  mean  those  that  divide  their  loot  of  the  people  with  their  cam- 
paign managers,  and  unfriendly  with  the  bad  trusts,  generally  those 
that  refuse  to  contribute  freely.  The  people  know  that  all  these  in- 
dustrial pirates  and  monopolistic  cormorants  have  grown  up  and  have 
been  fostered  and  encouraged  by  the  Eepublican  party  during  its  control 
of  the  Government.  The  cost  of  living  has  been  increased  enormously 
during  this  time,  and  wages  have  practically  stood  still.  No  relief  has 
come  to  the  people,  but  we  are  told  by  the  Eepublican  party  that  if 
they  are  given  further  control  of  the  Government  they  will  do  in  the 
future  what  they  have  failed  to  do  in  the  sixteen  years  of  the  past — 
destroy  their  own  creation. 

When  the  Democratic  party  passed  tariff  reduction  measures  so  just 
that  the  Senate,  controlled  by  the  opposition  party,  could  not  resist  their 
passage,  offering  to  the  people  cheaper  clothes,  to  the  farmer  and 
la  I  Mirer  dioaper  implements  \\itli  which  to  toil,  cheaper  meat  and  bread 


APPENDIX  399 

to  the  hungry,  reducing  the  cost  of  living  greatly,  privilege  made  its 
last  desperate  stand  in  the  White  House  and  won  by  reason  of  the 
President's  veto  of  these  righteous  measures.  The  American  people 
desire  to  turn  the  White  House  from  a  bulwark  of  privilege  into  a 
fortress  of  justice  to  the  people.  The  people  want  one  in  control  there 
who  will  n«t  resist  the  people 's  will,  but  who  will  lead  the  fight  upon  their 
behalf. 

\rw  Jersey  two  years  ago  was  one  of  the  most  unprogressive  States 
in  the  Union.  Special  privilege  was  strongly  intrenched;  public  service 
agencies  had  become  the  masters  of  the  people ;  labor  was  burdened 
by  laws  not  only  archaic,  but  oppressive;  ballot  reform  was  badly 
needed;  boss  rule  had  both  parties  by  the  throat.  The  people  of  the  great 
State  were  themselves  really  progressive;  they  wanted  a  voice  to  speak 
for  them,  a  real  fighter  for  the  people 's  rule.  They  selected  you  for 
the  mighty  task,  nominated  upon  a  platform  calling  for  justice  to  the 
people.  You  were  elected  by  them  as  their  Governor.  Now  we  behold 
New  Jersey  in  the  majesty  and  glory  of  self-government.  In  less  than 
two  years  your  master  mind,  your  splendid  leadership,  your  love  of 
the  people's  rule,  your  belief  that  platform  promises  were  to  be  faith 
fully  carried  out,  a  real  bond  of  honor  between  the  party  and  the  people, 
broke  the  chains  that  bound  New  Jersey,  and  she  stands  today  the  re- 
deemed Commonwealth.  The  other  States  of  the  Union  watched  your 
struggle  to  free  the  people  here,  and  now  they  are  ready  to  call  you  to 
do  for  the  whole  Nation  what  you  did  for  a  single  State,  deliver  the  Gov- 
ernment into  the  hands  of  the  people. 

A  Committee  composed  of  the  Permanent  Chairman  of  the  Convention 
and  one  delegate  from  each  State  and  Territory  was  appointed  to  inform 
you  of  your  selection  as  the  nominee  of  the  Democratic  party  for  Presi- 
dent of  the  United  States  and  to  request  you  to  accept  it,  and  the  Con- 
vention did  me  the  honor  to  make  me  Chairman  of  this  Committee, 
charged  with  such  a  happy  mission. 

Therefore,  in  compliance  with  the  command  of  that  Convention,  this 
Committee  performs  that  pleasing  duty,  and,  as  the  appointed  agent 
of  that  great  National  Democratic  Convention,  I  hand  you  this  formal 
letter  of  notification  signed  by  the  members  of  the  Notification  Commit- 
tee, accompanied  by  a  copy  of  the  platform  adopted  by  the  Convention, 
and  upon  that  platform  I  have  the  honor  to  request  your  acceptance  of 
the  tendered  nomination.  And,  upon  behalf  of  the  Democrats  of  the 
whole  Republic,  who  are  united,  aggressive  and  militant,  we  pledge  you 
their  united  and  earnest  support,  and  may  God  guide  you  to  a  glorious 
victory  in  November. 


RESPONSE  OF 
WOODROW   WILSON 

TO    XOTIFICATIOX    ADDRESS 
Delivered  at  Seagirt,  Xe\s   Jersey,  August  7th.  1912. 

^Ir.  James  and  gentlemen  of  the  Notification  Committee:  Speaking 
for  the  National  Democratic  Con  volition,  recently  a^-se  nbled  at  Baltimore, 
you  have  notified  me  of  my  nomination  by  the  Democratic  party  for  the 
high  office  of  President  of  the  United  States.  Allow  me  to  thank 
you  very  warmly  for  the  generous  terms  in  which  you  have,  through 
your  distinguished  Chairman,  corn-eyed  the  notification,  and  for  the 
thoughtful  personal  courtesy  with  which  you  have  performed  your  in- 
teresting and  important  errand. 

Y  I  accept  the  nomination  with  a  deep  sense  of  its  unusual  significance 
and  of  the  great  honor  done  me,  and  also  with  a  very  profound  sense 
of  my  responsibility  to  the  party  and  to  the  Nation.  You  will  expect 
me  in.  accepting  the  honor  to  speak  very  plainly  the  faith  that  is  in 
me.  You  will  expect  me,  in  brief,  to  talk  politics  and  open  the  campaign 
in  words  whose  meaning  no  one  need  doubt.  You  will  expect  me  to 
sj.eak  to  the  country  as  well  as  to  yourselves.  / 

We  cannot  intelligently  talk  politics  unless  we  know  to  whom  we 
are  talking  and  in  what  circumstances.  The  present  circumstances  are 
clearly  unusual.  No  previous  political  campaign  in  our  time  has  dis 
closed  anything  like  them.  The  audience  we  address  is  in  no  ordinary 
temper.  It  is  no  audience  of  partisans.  Citizens  of  every  class  and  party 
and  prepossession  sit  together,  a  single  people,  to  learn  whether  we 
understand  their  life  and  know  how  to  afford  them  the  counsel  and  guid- 
ance they  are  now  keenly  aware  that  they  stand  in  need  of.  We  must 
speak,  not  to  catch  votes,  but  to  satisfy  the  thought  and  conscience  of  a 
.people  deeply  stirred  by  the  conviction  that  they  have  come  to  a  critical 
turning  point  in  their  moral  and  political  development. 

\Ve  stand  in  the  pr&lt;  sence  of  an  a\\akened  nation,  impatient  of 
partisan  make-belief.  The  public  man  who  does  not  realize  the  fact; 
and  feel  its  stimulation  must  lie  singularly  unsusceptible  to  the  influences 
that  stir  in  every  quarter  about  him.  The  nation  has  awakened  to  a 
sense  of  neglected  ideals  :&gt;ml  neglected  duties;  to  a. consciousness  that 
1li&lt;-  rank  and  file  of  her  people  find  life  very  hard  to  sustain,  that 
her  young  men  find  opportunity  embarrassed,  and  that  her  older  men  find 
business  dillicult  to  renew  and  maintain,  because  of  circumstances  of 
privilege  and  private  nd\antage  which  have  interlaced  their  subtle 
threads  throughout  almost  every  part  of  the  t'rame\\i.rk  of  our  presoin 
law.  She  lias  awakened  to  the  knowledge  that  she  iias  lost  certain 
cherished  liberties  and  wi.slrd  priceless  resources  which  she  ha. I  solemnly 

400 


APPENDIX  401 

undertaken  to  hold  in  trust  for  posterity  and  for  all  mankind;  and  to 
I  he  conviction  that  she  stands  confronted  with  an  occasion  for  construc- 
tive statesmanship  such  as  has  not  arisen  since  the  great  days  in  which 
her  government  was  set  up. 

Plainly,  it  is  a  new  age.  The  tonic  of  such  a  time  is  very  ex- 
hilarating. It  requires  self-restraint  not  to  attempt  too  much,  and  yet 
it  would  be  cowardly  to  attempt  too  little.  The  path  of  duty,  soberly 
and  bravely  trod,  is  the  way  to  service  and  distinction,  and  many 
adventurous  feet  seek  to  set  put  upon  it. 

Tlieiv  never  was  a  time  when  impatience  and  suspicion  were  more 
keenly  aroused  by  private  power  selfishly  employed;  when  jealousy  of 
everything  conr.'aled  or  touched  with  any  purpose  not  linked  with  general 
good,  or  inconsistent  with  it,  more  sharply  or  immediately  displayed 
itself. 

Xor  was  the  country  ever  more  susceptible  to  unselfish  appeals  or  to 
the  high  arguments  of  sincere  justice.  These  are  the  unmistakable  symp- 
toms of  an  awakening.  There  is  the  more  need  for  wise  counsel  be- 
cause the  people  are  so  ready  to  heed  counsel  if  it  be  given  honestly 
and  in  their  interest. 

It  is  in  the  broad  light  of  this  new  day  that  we  stand  face  to  face — 
with  what?  Plainly,  not  with  questions  of  party,  not  with  a  contest  for 
office,  not  with  a  petty  struggle  for  advantage,  Democrat  against  .Re- 
publican, liberal  against  conservative,  progressive  against  reactionary. 
With  great  questions  of  right  and  of  justice,  rather — questions  of 
national  development,  of  the  development  of  character  and  of  stand- 
ards of  action  no  less  than  of  a  better  business  system,  more  free,  more 
equitable,  more  open  to  ordinary  men,  practicable  to  live  under,  tolerable 
to  work  under,  or  a  better  fiscal  system  whose  taxes  shall  not  come  out 
of  the  pockets  of  the  many  to  go  into  the  pockets  of  the  few,  and 
within  whose  intricacies  special  privilege  may  not  so  easily  find  covert. 
The  forces  of  the  nation  are  asserting  themselves  against  every  form  of 
special  privilege  and  private  control,  and  are  seeking  bigger  things 
than  they  have  ever  heretofore  achieved.  They  are  sweeping  away  what 
is  unrighteous  in  order  to  vindicate  once  more  the  essential  rights  of 
human  life;  and,  what  is  very  serious  for  us,  they  are  looking  to  us  for 
guidance,  disinterested  guidance,  at  once  honest  and  fearless. 

At  such  a  time,  and  in  the  presence  of  such  circumstances,  what  is 
the  meaning  of  our  platform,  and  what  is  our  responsibility  under  it? 
What  are  our  duty  and  our  purpose?  The  platform  is  meant  to  show 
that  we  know  what  the  nation  is  thinking  about,  what  it  is  most  con- 
cerned about,  what  it  wishes  corrected,  and  what  it  desires  to  see  at- 
tempted that  is  new  and  constructive  and  intended  for  its  long  future. 
But  for  us  it  is  a  very  practical  document.  We  are  now  about  to  ask 
the  people  of  the  United  States  to  adopt  our  platform ;  we  are  about  to 
ask  them  to  entrust  us  with  office  and  power  and  the  guidance  of  their 
atl'airs.  Thev  will  wish  to  know  what  sort  of  men  we  are  and  of  whar 


402  APPENDIX 

definite  purpose;  what  translation  of  action  and  of  policy  we  intend 
to  give  to  the  general  terms  of -the  platform  which  the  Convention  at 
Baltimore  put  forth,  should  we  be  elected.  , 

The  platform  is  not  a  programme.  A  programme  must  consist  of 
measures,  administrative  acts,  and  acts  of , .legislation.  The  proof  of  the, 
pudding  is  the  eating  thereof.  How  do  we  intend  to  make  it  edible 
and  digestible?  From  this  time  on  we  shall  be  under  interrogation. 
How  do  we  expect  to  handle  each  of  the  great  matters  that  must  be 
taken  up  by  the  next  Congress  and  the  next  Administration? 

What  is  there  to  do?  It  is  hard  to  sum  the  great  task  up,  but  ap- 
parently this  is  the  sum  of  the  matter:  There  are  two  great  things  to 
do.  One  is  to  set  up  the  rule  of  justice  and  of  right  in  such  matters  as 
the  tariff,  the  regulation  of  the  trusts  and  the  prevention  of  monopoly, 
the  adaptation  of  our  banking  and  currency  laws  to  the  varied  uses  to 
which  our  people  must  put  them,  the  treatment  of  those  who  do  the 
daily  labor  in  our  factories  and  mines  and  throughout  all  of  our  great 
industrial  and  commercial  undertakings,  and  the  political  life  of  the 
people  of  the  Philippines,  for  whom  we  hold  governmental  power  in 
trust,  for  their  service  is  not  our  own.  The  other,  the  additional  duty, 
is  the  great  task  of  protecting  our  people  and  our  resources  and  of 
keeping  open  to  the  whole  people  the  doors  of  opportunity  through 
which  they  must,  generation  by  generation,  pass  if  they  are  to  make 
conquest  of  their  fortunes  in  health,  in  freedom,  in  peace  and  in  con- 
tentment. In  the  performance  of  this  second  great  duty  we  are  face  to 
face  with  questions  of  conservation  and  of  development,  questions  of 
forests  and  water  powers  and  mines  and  waterways,  o'f  the  building  of 
an  adequate  merchant  marine,  and  the  opening  of  every  highway  and 
facility  and  the  setting  up  of  every  safeguard  needed  by  a  great,  indus- 
trious, expanding  nation. 

These  are  all  great  matters  upon  which  everybody  should  be  heard.  We 
have  got  into  trouble  in  recent  years  chiefly  because  these  large  things, 
which  ought  to  have  been  handled  by  taking  counsel  with  as  large  a  num- 
ber of  persons  as  possible,  because  they  touched  every  interest  and  the  life 
of  every  class  and  region,  have  in  fact  been  too  often  handled  in  private 
conference.  They  have  been  settled  by  very  small,  and  often  deliberately 
exclusive  groups  of  men  who  undertook  to  speak  for  the  whole  nation,  or, 
rather  for,  themselves  in  the  terms  of  the  whole  nation — very  honestly  it 
may  be,  but  very  ignorantly  sometimes,  and  very  short  sightedly,  too — 
a  poor  substitute  for  genuine  common  counsel.  No  group  of  electors, 
economic  or  political,  can  speak  for  a  people.  They  have  neither  the  point 
of  view  nor  the  knowledge.  Our  difficulty  is  not  that  wicked  and  design- 
ing men  have  plotted  against  us,  but  that  our  common  affairs  have  been 
determined  upon  too  narrow  a  view,  and  by  too  private  an  initiative. 
Our  task  now  is  to  effect  a  great  readjustment  and  get  the  forces  of 
the  whole  people  once  more  into  play.  We  need  no  revolution ;  we  need 


APPENDIX  403 

no  excited  change;  we  need  only  a  new  point  of  view  and  a  new  method 
and  spirit  of  counsel. 

We  are  servants  of  the  people,  the  whole  people.  The  nation  has 
been  unnecessarily,  unreasonably  at  war  within  itself.  Interest  has 
clashed  with  interest  when  there  were  common  principles  of  right  and 
of  fair  dealing  which  might  and  should  have  bound  them  all  together, 
not  as  rivals,  but  as  partners.  As  the  servants  of  all,  \ve  are  bound 
to  undertake  the  great  duty  of  accommodation  and  adjustment. 

We  cannot  undertake  it  except  in  a  spirit  which  some  find  it  hard 
to  understand.  Some  people  only  smile  when  you  speak  of  yourself  as  a 
servant  of  the  people;  it  seen  s  to  them  like  affectation  or  mere  dem- 
agoguery.  They  ask  what  the  unthinking  crowd  knows  or  comprehends 
of  great  complicated  matters  of  government.  They  shrug  their  shoulders 
and  lift  their  eyebrows  when  you  speak  as  if  you  really  believed  in 
Presidential  primaries,  in  the  direct  election  of  United  States  Senators, 
and  in  an  utter  publicity  about  everything  that  concerns  Government, 
from  the  sources  of  campaign  funds  to  the  intimate  debate  of  the 
highest  affairs  of  state. 

They  do  not.  or  will  not,  comprehend  the  solemn  thing  that  is  in 
your  thought.  You  know  as  well  as  they  do  that  there  are  all  sorts 
and  conditions  of  men — the  unthinking  mixed  with  the  wise,  the  reckless 
with  the  prudent,  the  unscrupulous  with  the  fair  and  'honest — and  yo\] 
know  what  they  sometimes  forget,  that  every  class,  without  exception, 
affords  a  sample  of  the  mixture,  the  learned  and  the  fortunate  no  less 
than  the  uneducated  and  the  struggling  mass.  But  you  see  more  than 
they  do.  You  see  that  these  multitudes  of  men,  mixed  of  every  kind 
and  quality,  constitute  somehow  an  organic  and  noble  whole,  a  single 
people,  and  that  they  have  interests  which  no  man  can  privately  deter- 
mine without  their  knowledge  and  counsel.  That  is  the  meaning  of 
representative  government  itself.  Representative  government  is  nothing 
more  nor  less  than  an  effort  to  give  voice  to  this  great  body  through 
spokesmen  chosen  out  of  every  grade  and  class. 

You  may  think  that  I  am  wandering  off  into  a  general  disquisition 
that  has  little  to  do  with  the  business  in  hand;  but  I  am  not.  This  is 
business — business  of  the  deepest  sort.  It  will  solve  our  difficulties 
if  you  will  but  take  it  as  business. 

See  how  it  makes  business  out  of  the  tariff  question.  The  tariff 
question,  ?.s  dealt  with  in  our  time  at  any  rate,  has  not  been  business. 
It  has  been  politics.  Tariff  schedules  have  been  made  up  for  the  pur- 
pose of  keeping  as  large  a  number  as  possible  of  the  rich  and  influen- 
tial manufacturers  of  the  country  in  a  good  humor  with  the  Republican 
party,  which  desired  their  constant  financial  support.  The  tariff  has 
become  a  system  of  favors,  which  the  phraseology  of  the  schedule  was 
often  deliberately  contrived  to  conceal.  It  becomes  a  matter  of  business, 
of  legitimate  business,  only  when  the  partnership  and  understanding 
it  represents  is  between  the  leaders  of  Congress  and  the  whole  people  of

the    United    States,    ir stead    of    between    the   leaders    of    Congress    and 
•  small  groups  of  manufacturers  demanding  special  recognition  and  con- 
sideration.      . 

That  is  why  the  general  idea  of  representative  government  becomes'  a 
necessary  part  of  the  tariff  question.  Who,  when  you  conn1  down  to 
the  hard  facts  of  the  matter,  have  been  represented  in  recent  years  when 
our  tariff  schedules  were  being  discussed  and  determined,  not-  on  the 
floor  of  Congress,  for  that  is  not  where  they  have  been  determined,  but 
in  the  committee  rooms  and  conferences?  That  is  the  heart  of  the 
whole  affair.  Will  you,  can  you,  bring  the  whole  people  into  the  part- 
nership or  not?  No •  one  is  discontented  with  representative  government; 
it  falls  under  question  only  when  it  ceases  to  be  representative. 
It  is  at  bottom  a  question  of  good  faith  and  morals. 

•  How  does  the  present  tariff  look  in  the  light  of  it?  I  say.  nothing 
for  the  moment  about  the  policy  of  protection,  conceived  and  carried 
out  as  a  disinterested  statesman  might  conceive  it.  Our  own  clear 
conviction  as  Democrats  is,  that  in  the  last  analysis  the  only  safe  and 
.legitimate  object  of  tariff  duties,  a-s  of  taxes  of  every  other  kind,  is  to 
raise  revenue  for  the  support  of  the  Government ;  but  that  is  not  my 
present  point. 

We  denounce  the  Payne-Aldrich  Tariff  Act  as  the  most  conspicuous 
example  ever  afforded  the  country  of  the  special  favors  and  monopolistic 
advantages  which  the  leaders  of  the  Republican  party  have  so  often 
shown  themselves  willing  to  extend  to  those  to  whom  they  looked  for 
campaign  contributions.  Tariff  duties,  as  they  have  employed  them, 
have  not  been  a  means  of  setting  up  an  equitable  system  of  protection. 
They  have  been,  on  the  contrary,  a  method  of  fostering  special  privilege. 
They  have  made  it  easy  to  establish  monopoly  in  our  domestic  markets. 
Trusts  have  owed  their  origin  and  their  secure  power  to  them.  Tho 
economic  freedom  of  our  people,  our  prosperity  in  trade,  our  untram 
meled  energy  in  manufacture,  depend  upon  our  reconsideration  from  top 
to  bottom  in  an  entirely  different  spirit. 

We  do  not  ignore  the  fact  that  the  business  of  a  country  Uke 
ours  is  exceedingly  sensitive  to  changes  in  legislation  of  this  kind.  It 
has  been  built  up,  however  ill-advisedly,  upon  tariff  schedules  written 
in  the  way  I  have  indicated,  and  its  foundations  must  not  be  too 
radically  or  too  suddently  disturbed.  When  \ve  act,  we  should  act 
with  caution  and  prudence,  like  men  who  know  what  they  are  about,  ami 
not  like  these  in  love  with  a  theory.  It  is  obvious  that  the  chants  we 
make  should  be  7i'ade  only  at  a  rate  and  in  such  a  way  as  will  leas' 
interfere  \\ilh  1  he  i.or.nal  :ind  healthful  couise  of  commerce  and  manu- 
fact'.nc.  I Inl  \\e  shall  not  on  that  account  act  with  timidity,  as  if  we 
did  nol  know  our  own  minds,  for  we  are  certain  of  our  ground  :im! 
of  our  object.  There  shmld  In-  ;in  mimedjale  revision,  and  it  should 
lie  downward,  unh&lt;  silat  iugly  and  steadily  downward.

enterprixs  of  the  country:  until  *peci:d  fasois  of  eveiy  sort  have 
been  al-si.luuly  withdrawn  and  eveiy  part  of  our  la\\s  of  taxation  shaii 
ha\e  In  en  transftuMud  fn  in  a  system  of  governmental  patronage  into  a 
Msicm  of  just  and  reasonable  charges  which  shall  fall  where  they  will 
create  the  least  burden.  When  we  shall  ha\e  done  that,  we  can  fix 
:!s  of  revenue  and  of  busir.es&lt;  adjustments  in  a  new  sprit  and 
with  clear  minds.  We  shall  then  be  partners  with  all  the  business  me;) 
of  the  country,  and  a  day  of  freer,  more  stable  pn  s  erity  shall  have 
dawned. 

There  has  been  no  more  demoralizing  influence  in  our  politics  in  our 
time  than  the  influence  of  tariff  legislation,  the  influence  of  the  idea  that 
the  Goveinner.t  w;.s  the  grand  dispenser  of  favois.  the  maker  and  un- 
maker  of  fortunes,  and  of  opportunities  such  as  certain  men  have 
sought  in  order  to  control  the  movement  of  trade  and  industry  through- 
out the  Continent.  It  has  made  the  Government  a  prize  to  be  eap- 
tined  an  1  parties  the  means  of  effecting  the  capture.  It  has  made  the 
:i  of  one  of  the  most  virile  and  enterprising  nations  in  tho 
world  timid,  fretful,  full  of  alarms,  has  robbed  them  of  self-confidence  and 
maniy  force,  until  they  have  cried  out  that  they  could  do  nothing  with- 
out the  assistance  of  the  Government  at  Washington.  It  has  made  then; 
feel  that  their  lives  depended  upon  the  Ways  and  Means  Committee  of 
the  House  and  the  Finance  (  on.aiittee  of  the  Senate  (in  these  later 
years  particularly  the  Finance  Committee  of  the  Senate). 

They  have  ii  s'-ned  very  anxiously  that  these  committees  should  be 
made  up  only  of  their  "  f riem'.s " ;  until  the  country  in  its  turn  grew 
suspicious  and  wondered  how  those  committees  were  being  guided  and 
controlled,  by  what  influences  and  plans  of  peisonal  advantage.  Govern- 
ment cannot  be  wholesomely  conducted  in  such  an  atmosphere.  Its  very 
honesty  is  in  jeopardy.  Favors  are  never  conceived  in  the  general 
interest:  they  are  always  for  the  benefit  of  the  few,  and  the  few  who 
seek  and  obtain  them  have  only  themselves  to  blame  if  presently  they 
seem  to  be  contemned  and  distrusted. 

For  whar  has  the  result  1  eon  ?  I'rosj  erity  .'  Yes,  if  by  prosperity 
vou  mean  vast  wealth  no  matter  how  distributed,  or  whether  distributed 
at  all.  or  not;  if  you  mean  vast  enterprises  built  up  to  be  presently 
concentrated  under  the  contiol  of  &gt;•&lt;  mparatively  small  bodies  of  men, 
who  can  determine  almost  at  pleasure  whether  there  shall  be  competi- 
tion or  not.  The  Nation  as  n  nation  has  grown  iinmei.sely  rich.  She  is 
justly  proud  of  her  industries  and  of  the  genius  of  her  men  of  affairs. 
They  cap  master  anything  they  set  their  minds  to,  and  we  have  been

/ 

greatly  stimulated  under  their  leadership  and  command.     Their  laurel* 
are  many  and  very  green. 

We  must  accord  them  the  great  honors  that  are  their  due  and  we 
must  preserve  what  they  have  built  up  for  us.  But  what  of  the  other 
side  of  the  picture?  It  is  not  as  easy  for  us  to  live  as  it  used  to  be. 
Our  money  will  not  buy  as  much.  High  wages,  even  when  we  can  ger 
them,  yield  us  no  great  comfort.  We  used  to  be  better  off  with  less, 
because  a  dollar  could  buy  so  much  more.  The  majority  of  us  have  been 
disturbed  to  find  ourselves  growing  poorer,  even  though  our  earnings 
were  slowly  increasing.  Prices  climb  faster  than  we  can  push  our 
earnings  up. 

Moreover,  we  begin  to  perceive  some  things  about  the  movement  of 
prices  that  concern  us  very  deeply,  and  fix  our  attention  upon  the 
tariff  schedules  with  a  more  definite  determination  than  ever  to  get  tu 
the  bottom  of  this  matter.  We  have  been  looking  into  it,  at  trials  held 
under  the  Sherman  Act  and  in  investigations  in  the  committee  rooms  of 
Congress,  where  men  who  wanted  to  know  the  real  facts  have  been 
busy  with  inquiry;  and  we  begin  to  ste  very  clearly  what  at  least  some 
of  the  methods  are  by  which  prices  are  fixed.  We  know  that  they  are 
not  fixed  by  the  competitions  of  the  market,  or  by  the  ancient  law 
of  supply  and  demand  which  is  to  be  found  stated  in  aJl  the  primers- 
of  economies,  but  by  private  arrangements  with  regard  to  what  the 
supply  should  be  and  agreenieiits  among  the  producers  themselves.  Those 
who  buy  are  not  even  represented  by  counsel.  The  high  cost  of  living  i&amp; 
arranged  by  private  understanding. 

We  naturally  ask  ourselves,  how  did  these  gentlemen  get  control  of 
these  things?  Who  handed  our  economic  laws  over  to  them  for  legisla- 
tive and  contractual  alteration?  We  have  in  these  disclosures  still 
another  view  of  the  tariff,  still  another  proof  that,  not  the  people  of 
the  United  States,  but  only  a  very  small  number  of  them  have  been  part- 
ners in  that  legislation.  Those  few  have  learned  how  to  control  tariff 
legislation,  and  as  they  have  perfected  their  control  they  have  consoli- 
dated their  interests.  Men  of  the  same  interest  have  drawn  together; 
have  united  their  enterprises  and  have  formed  trusts;  and  trusts  can 
control  prices.  Up  to  a  certain  point  (and  only  up  to  a  certain  point) 
great  combinations  effect  great  economies  in  administration,  and  in- 
crease efficiency  by  simplifying  and  perfecting  organization;  but,  whether 
they  effect  economies  or  not;  they  can  very  easily  determine  prices  by 
intimate  agreement,  so  soon  as  they  come  to  control  a  sufficient  per- 
centage of  the  product  in  any  great  line  of  business;  and  we  now  know 
that  they  do. 

I  am  not  drawing  up  an  indictment  against  anybody.  This  is  the 
natural  history  of  such  tariffs  as  are  now  contrived,  as  it  is  the  natural 
history  of  all  governmental  favors  and  of  all  licenses  to  use  the  Govern 
ment  to  help  certain  groups  of  individuals  along  in  life.  Nobody  in 
particular,  I  suppose,  is  to  blame,  and  I  am  not  interested  just  now 


APPENDIX  407 

in  blaming  anybody;  I  am  simply  trying  to  point  out  what  the  situa- 
tion is,  in  order  to  suggest  what  there  is  for  us  to  do,  if  we  would  serve 
the  country  as  a  whole.  The  fact  is,  that  the  trusts  have  been  formed, 
have  gained  all  but  complete  control  of  the  larger  enterprises  of  the 
country,  have  fixed  prices  and  fixed  them  high  so  that  profits  might  be 
rolled  up  that  were  thoroughly  worth  while,  and  that  the  tariff,  with  its 
artificial  protection  and  stimulations,  gave  them  the  opportunity  to  do 
these  things,  and  has  safeguarded  them  in  that  opportunity. 

The  trusts  do  not  belong  to  the  period  of  infant  industry.  They  are 
not  the  products  of  the  time,  that  old  laborious  time,  when  the  great 
continent  we  live  on  was  undeveloped,  the  young  nation  struggling  to 
find  itself  and  get  upon  its  feet  amidst  older  and  more  experienced 
competitors.  They  belong  to  a  very  recent  and  very  sophisticated  age, 
when  men  knew  what  they  wanted  and  knew  how7  to  get  it  by  the  favor 
of  the  Government.  It  is  another  chapter  in  the  natural  history  of 
power  and  of  governing  classes. 

The  next  chapter  will  set  us  free  again.  There  will  be  no  flavor  of 
tragedy  in  it.  It  will  be  a  chapter  of  readjustment,  not  of  pain  and 
rough  disturbance.  It  will  Avitness  a  turning  back  from  what  is  ab 
normal  to  what  is  normal.  It  will  see  a  restoration  of  the  laws  of 
trade,  which  are  the  laws  of  competition  and  of  unhampered  oppor- 
tunity, under  which  men  of  every  sort  are  set  free  and  encouraged  to 
enrich  the  nation. 

I  am  not  one  of  those  who  think  that  competition  can  be  established 
by  law  against  the  drift  of  a  world-wide  economic  tendency;  neither  am 
I  one  of  those  who  believe  that  business  done  upon  a  great  scale  by  a 
single  organization — call  it  corporation,  or  what  you  will — is  necessarily 
dangerous  to  the  liberties,  even  the  economic  liberties,  of  a  great  people 
like  our  own,  full  of  intelligence  and  of  indomitable  energy.  I  am  not 
"afraid  of  anything  that  is  normal.  I  dare  say  we  shall  never  return 
to  the  old  order  of  individual  competition,  and  that  the  organization  of 
business  upon  a  great  scale  of  co-operation  is,  up  to  a  certain  point, 
itself  normal  and  inevitable. 

Power  in  the  hands  of  great  business  men  does  not  make  me  appre- 
hensive, unless  it  springs  out  of  advantages  which  they  have  not  created 
for  themselves.  Big  business  is  not  dangerous  because  it  is  big,  but  be- 
cause its  bigness  is  an  unwholesome  inflation  created  by  privileges  and 
exemptions  which  it  ought  not  to  enjoy.  While  competition  cannot  be 
created  by  statutory  enactment,  it  can  in  large  measure  be  revived  by 
changing  the  laws  and  forbidding  the  practices  that  killed  it,  and  by 
enacting  laws  that  will  give  it  heart  and  occasion  again.  We  can 
arrest  and  prevent  monopoly.  It  has  assumed  new  shapes  and  adopted 
new  processes  in  our  time,  but  these  are  now  being  disclosed  and  can 
be  dealt  with. 

The  general  terms  of  the  present  Federal  Ant i- Trust  Law,  forbidding 
"combinations  in  restraint  of  trade''  have  apparently  proven  ineffectual. 


408  API-KXDIX 

Trusts  have  grown  up  under  its  l&gt;an  very  luxuriantly,  and  have  pursue.! 
the  methods  by  which  so  many  of  them  have-  established  virtual  monopo- 
lies without  serious  let  or  hindrance.  It  iias  roared  against  them  like, 
any  suckling  dove.  I  am  not  assessing  the  responsibility,  1  am  merri&gt; 
stating  the  fact.  But  the  means  and  methods  by  which  trusts  have 
established  monopolies  have  now  become  known. 

It  will  be  necessary  to  supplement  the  present  law  with  such  laws, 
both  civil  and  criminal,  as  will  effectually  punish  and  prevent  : 
methods,  adding  such  other  laws  as  may  be  necessary  to  provide  suitabl- 
and  adequate  judicial  processes,  whether  civil  or  criminal,  to  disclo.-,,- 
tln-m  and  follow  them  to  final  verdict  and  judgment.  They  must  be 
specifically  and  directly  met  by  law  as  they  develop. 

But  the  problem  and  the  difficulty  are  much  greater  than  that.  There 
are  not  merely  great  trusts  and  combinations  which  are  to  be  con- 
trolled and  deprived  of  their  power  to  create  monopolies  and  destroy 
rivals,  there  is  something  bigger  still  than  they  are  and  more  subtle, 
more  evasive,  more  difficult  to  eleal  with.  There  are  vast  confederacies 
(as  I  may  perhaps  call  them  for  the  sake  of  convenience)  of  banks. 
railways,  express  companies,  insurance  companies,  manufacturing  corpora 
tions,  mining  corporations,  power  and  development  companies  and  all 
the  rest  of  the  circle,  bound  together  by  the  fact  that  the  ownership 
of  their  stock  and  the  members  of  their  boards  of  directors  are  controlled 
and  determined  by  comparatively  small  anel  closely  inter-related  grouj  s 
of  persons  who,  by  their  informal  confederacy,  may  control,  if  they  please 
and  when  they  will,  both  credit  and  enterprise. 

There  is  nothing  illegal  about  these  confederacies,  so  far  as  I  can 
perceive.  They  have  come  about  very  naturally,  generally  without  plan 
or  deliberation,  rather  because  there  was  so  much  money  to  be  invested 
and  it  was  in  the  hands,  at  great  financial  centers,  of  men  acquainted 
with  one  another  and  intimately  associated  in  business,  than  because 
anyone  had  conceived  and  was  carrying  out  a  plan  of  general  control ; 
biit  they  are  none  the  le^s  potent  a  force  in  our  economic  and  finan- 
cial system  on  that  account. 

They  are  part  of  our  problem.  Their  very  existence  gives  rise  to  the 
suspicion  of  a  "money  trust,"  a  concentration  of  the  control  of  credit 
which  may  at  any  time  become  infinitely. elangerous  to  free  enterprise. 
If  such  a  concentration  and  control  does  not  actually  exist,  it  is  evident 
that  it  can  easily  be  set  up  and  used  at  will.  Laws  must  be  devised 
which  will  prevent  this,  if  laws  can  be  worked  out  by  fair  and  free 
counsel  that  will  accomplish  that  result  without 'destroying  or  seriously 
embarrassing  any  sound  or  legitimate  business  undertaking  or  net-ess .-iry 
and  wholesome  arrangement. 

Let  me  say  again,  that  what  we  are-  seeking  is  not  destruction  of  any 
kind,  nor  the  disruption  of  any  sound  or  honest  thing,  but  merely  the 
rule  of  right  and  of  the  common  advantage.  T  am  happy  to  say  that  :\ 
new  spirit  has  begun  to  show  itself  in  the  last  year  or  t\\o  among  in 


APPENDIX  409 

flueiitial  men  of  business,  and.  what  is  perhaps  even  more  significant, 
among  the  lawyers  who  are  their  expert  advisers;  and  that  this  spirit  has 
displayed  itself  very  notably  in  the  last  few  months  in  an  effort  to 
return,  in  some  degree  at  any  rate,  to  the  practices  of  genuine 
competition. 

Only  a  very  little  while  ago  our  men  of  business  were  united  in 
resisting  every  proposal  of  change  and  reform  as  an  attack  on  business, 
an  embarrassment  to  all  large  enterprise,  an  intimation  that  settled 
ideas  of  property  were  to  be  set  ;isi&lt;Ic  and  a  new  and  strange  order  of 
things  created  out  of  hand.  While  they  thought  in  that  way  progress 
seemed  impossible  without  hot  contest  and  a  bitter  clash  between  inter- 
ests, almost  a  war  of  classes.  Common  counsel  seemed  all  but  hopeless, 
because  some  of  the  chief  parties  in  interest  would  not  take  part — 
seemed  even  to  resent  discussion  as  a  manifestation  of  hostility  toward 
themselves.  They  talked  constantly  about  vested  interests  and  were 
very  hot. 

It  is  a  happy  omen  that  their  attitude  has  changed.  They  see  that 
what  is  right  can  hurt  no  man;  that  a  new  adjustment  of  interests  is 
inevitable  and  desirable,  is  in  the  interest  of  everybody;  that  their 
own  honor,  their  own  intelligence,  their  own  practical  comprehension 
of  affairs  is  involved.  They  are  beginning  to  adjust  their  business  to 
the  new  standards.  Their  hand  is  no  longer  against  the  nation;  they 
are  part  of  it,  their  interests  are  bound  up  with  its  interests.  This  is 
not  true  of  all  of  them,  but  it  is  true  of  enough  of  them  to  show  what 
the  new  age  is  to  be,  and  how  the  anxieties  of  statesmen  are  to  be  eased, 
if  the  light  that  is  dawning  broadens  into  day. 

If  I  am  right  about  this,  it  is  going  to  be  easier  to  act  in  accord- 
ance with  the  rule  of  light  and  justice  in  dealing  with  the  labor  ques- 
tion. The  so-called  labor  question  is  a  question  only  because  we  have 
not  yet  found  the  rule  of  right  in  adjusting  the  interests  of  labor  and 
capital.  The  welfare,  the  happiness,  the  energy  and  spirit  of  the  men 
and  women  who  do  the  daily  work  in  our  mines  and  factories,  on  our 
railroads,  in  our  offices  and  marts  of  trade,  on  our  farms  and  on  the 
sea,  is  of  the  essence  of  our  national  life. 

There  can  be  nothing  wholesome  unless  their  life  is  wholesome; 
there  can  be  no  contentment  unless  they  are  contented.  Their  physical 
welfare  affects  the  soundness  of  the  whole  nation.  We  shall  never  get 
very  far  in  the  settlement  of  these  vital  matters  so  long  as  we  regard 
everything  done  for  the  working  man,  by  law  or  by  private  agreement, 
as  a  concession  yielded  to  keep  him  from  agitation  and  a  disturbance 
of  our  peace.  Here,  again,  the  sense  of  universal  partnership  must 
come  into  play  if  we  are  to  act  like  statesmen,  as  those  who  serve,  not 
a  class,  but  a  nation. 

The  working  people  of  America — if  they  must  be  distinguished 
from  the  minority  that  constitutes  the  rest  of  it — are,  of  course,  the 
backbone  of  the  nation.  No  law  that  safeguards  their  life,  that 


410  APPENDIX 

improves  the  physical  and  moral  conditions  under  which  they  live,  that 
makes  their  hours  of  labor  rational  and  tolerable,  t^iat  gives  them 
freedom  to  act  in  their  own  interest,  and  that  protects  them  where  thqv 
cannot  protect  themselves,  can  properly  be  regarded  as  class  legislation 
or  as  anything  but  as  a  measure,  taken  in  the  interest  of  the  whole 
people,  whose  partnership  in  right  action  we  are  trying  to  establish 
and  make  real  and  practical.  It  is  in  this  spirit  that  we  shall  act  if  we 
are  genuine  spokesmen  of  the  whole  country. 

As  our  programme  is  disclosed — for  no  man  can  forecast  it  ready- 
made  and  before  counsel  is  taken  of  everyone  concerned— this  must  be 
its  measure  and  standard,  the  interest  of  all  concerned.  For  example, 
in  dealing  with  the  complicated  and  difficult  question  of  the  reform 
of  our  banking  and  currency  laws,  it  is  plain  that  we  ought  to  consult 
very  many  persons  besides  the  bankers,  not  because  we  distrust  the 
bankers,  but  because  they  do  not  necessarily  comprehend  the  business 
of  the  country,  notwithstanding  they  are  indispensable  servants  of  it 
and  may  do  a  vast  deal  to  make  it  hard  or  easy. 

No  mere  bankers'  plea  will  meet  the  requirements,  no  matter  how 
honestly  conceived.  It  should  be  a  merchants'  and  farmers'  plan  as 
well,  elastic  in  the  hands  of  those  who  use  it  as  an  indispensable  part 
of  their  daily  business.  I  do  not  know  enough  about  this  subject  to  be 
dogmatic  about  it ;  I  know  only  enough  to  be  sure  what  the  partnerships 
in  it  should  be,  and  that  the  control  exercised  over  any  system  we  may 
set  up  should  be,  so  far  as  possible,  a  control  emanating,  not  from  a 
single  special  class,  but  from  the  general  body  and  authority  of  the 
nation  itself. 

In  dealing  with  the  Philippines  we  should  not  allow  ourselves  to 
stand  upon  any  mere  point  of  pride,  as  if,  in  'order  to  keep  our  coun- 
tenance in  the  families  of  nations,  it  were  necessary  for  us  to  make  th-? 
same  blunders  of  selfishness  as  that  other  nations  have  made.  We  arc 
not  the  owners  of  the  Philippines.  We  hold  them  in  trust  for  the 
people  who  live  in  them.  They  are  theirs,  for  the  uses  of  their  life. 
We  are  not  even  their  partners.  It  is  our  duty,  as  trustees,  to  make 
whatever  arrangement  of  government  will  be  most  serviceable  to  their 
freedom  and  development.  Here,  again,  we  are  to  set  up  the  rule  of 
justice  and  of  right. 

The  rule  of  the  people  is  no  idle  phrase,  those  who  believe  in  it,  as 
who  does  not  that  has  caught  the  real  spirit  of  America?  believe  that 
there  can  be  no  rule  of  right  without  it;  that  right  in  politics  is  made 
up  of  the  interests  of  everybody,  and  everybody  should  take  part  in  the 
action  that  5s  to  determine  it. 

We  have  been  keen  for  presidential  primaries  and  the  direct  election 
of  United  States  Senators  because  we  wanted  the  action  of  the  Govern 
ment  to  be  determined  by  persons  whom  the  people  had  actually  desig- 
nated as  men  whom  they  were  ready  to  trust  and  follow.  We  have  been 
anxious  that  all  campaign  contributions  and  expenditures  should  be  dis- 


APPENDIX  411 

closed  to  the  public  in  fullest  detail,  because  we  regarded  the  influences' 
which  govern  campaigns  to  be  as  much  a  part  of  the  people's  business 
as  anything  else  connected  with  their  government.  We  are  working 
toward  a  very  definife  object,  the  universal  partnership  in  public  affairs 
upon  which  the  purity  of  politics  and  its  aim  and  spirit  depend. 

For  there  is  much  for  the  partners  to  undertake.  In  the  affairs  of  a 
great  nation  we  plan  and  labor,  not  for  the  present  only,  but  for  the  long 
future  as  well.  There  are  great  tasks  of  protection  and  conservation 
and  development  to  which  we  have  to  address  ourselves.  Government  has 
much  more  to  do  than  merely  to  right  wrongs  and  set  the  house  in  order. 

I  do  not  know  any  greater  question  than  that  of  conservation.  We 
have  been  a  spendthrift  nation  and  must  now  husband  what  we  have  left. 
We  must  do  more  than  that,  We  must  develop,  as  well  as  preserve,  our 
water  powers  and  must  add  great  waterways  to  the  transportation  facili- 
ties of  the  nation,  to  supplement  the  railways  within  our  borders  as  well 
as  upon  the  isthmus.  We  must  revive  our  merchant  marine,  too,  and  fill 
the  seas  again  with  our  own  fleets.  We  must  add  to  our  present  post- 
office  service  a  parcels  post  as  complete  as  that  of  any  other  nation.  We 
must  look  to  the  health  of  our  people  upon  every  hand,  as  well  as 
hearten  them  with  justice  and  opportunity.  This  is  the  constructive 
work  of  government.  This  is  the  policy  that  has  a  vision  and  a  hope 
and  that  looks  to  serve  mankind. 

There  are  many  sides  to  these  great  matters.  Conservation  is  easy 
to  generalize  about,  but  hard  to  particularize  about  wisely.  Eeservation 
is  not  the  whole  of  conservation.  The  development  of  great  States  must 
not  be  stayed  indefinitely  to  await  p.  policy  by  which  our  forests  and 
water  powers  can  prudently  be  made  use  of.  Use  and  development  must 
go  hand  in  hand.  The  policy  we  adopt  must  be  progressive,  not  negative 
merely,  as  if  we  did  not  know  what  to  do. 

With  regard  to  the  development  of  greater  and  more  numerous  water 
ways  and  the  building  up  of  a  merchant  marine,  we  must  follow  great 
constructive  lines  and  not  fall  back  upon  the  cheap  device  of  bounties 
and  subsidies.  In  the  case  of  the  Mississippi  Eiver,  that  great  central 
artery  of  our  trade,  it  is  plain  that  the  Federal  Government  must  build 
and  maintain  the  levees  and  keep  the  great  waters  in  harness  for  the 
general  use.  It  is  plain,  too,  that  vast  sums  of  money  must  be  spent  to 
develop  new  waterway  s  where  trade  will  be  most  served  and  transporta- 
tion most  readily  eheaj  ened  by  them.  Such  expenditures  are  no  largess 
on  the  part  of  the  Government;  they  are  national  investments. 

The  question  of  a  merchant  marine  turns  back  to^the  tariff  again,  to 
which  all  roads  seem  to  lead,  and  to  our  registry  laws,  which,  if  coupled 
with  the  tariff,  might  almost  be  supposed  to  have  been  intended  to  take 
the  American  flag  off  the  seas.  Bounties  are  hot  necessary,  if  you  will 
but  undo  some  of  the  things  that  have  been  done.  Without  a  great  mer- 
chant marine  we  cannot  take  our  rightful  place  in  the  commerce  of  the 
world. 


412  APPENDIX 

Merchants  who  must  depend  upon  the  larriers  of  rival  mercantile 
nations  to  carry  their  goods  to  market  are  at  a  disadvantage  in  inter- 
national trade  too  manifest  to  need  to  be  pointed  out;  and  our  merchants 
will  not  long  suffer  themselves — ought  not  to  suffer  themselves — to  be 
placed  at  such  a  disadvantage. 

Our  industries  have  expanded  to  such  a  point  that  they  will  burst 
their  packets  it'  they  cannot  find  a  free  outlet  to  the  markets  of  tin- 
world;  and  they  cannot  find  such  an  outlet  unless  they  lie  given  ships  of 
their  own  to  carry  their  goods — ships  that  will  go  the  routes  they  want 
them  to  go — and  prefer  the  interests  of  America  in  their  sailing  orders 
and  their  equipment.  Our  domestic  markets  no  longer  suffice.  We  need 
foreign  markets.  That  is  another  force  that  is  going  to  break  the  tariff 
down.  The  tariff  was  once  a  bulwark;  now  it  is  a  dam.  For  trade  is 
reciprocal;  we  cannot  sell  unless  we  also  buy. 

The  very  fact  that  we  have  at  last  taken  the  Panama  Canal  seriously 
in  hand  and  are  vigorously  pushing  it  toward  completion  is  eloquent  of 
our  reawakened  interest  in  -international  trade.  We  are  not  building  the 
canal  and  pouring  out  millions  upon  millions  of  money  upon  its  con- 
struction merely  to  establish  a  water  connection  between  the  two  coasts 
of  the  continent,  important  and  desirable  as  that  may  be,  particularly 
from  the  point  of  view  of  naval  defense.  It  is  meant  to  be  a  great 
international  highway.  It  would  be  a  little  ridiculous  if  we  should  build 
it  and  then  have  no  ships  to  send  through  it. 

There  have  been  years  when  not  a  single  ton  of  freight  passed 
through  the  great  Suez  Canal  in  an  American  bottom,  so  empty  are  the 
seas  of  our  ships  and  seamen.  We  must  mean  to  put  an  end  to  that 
kind  of  thing  or  we  would  not  be  "cutting  a  new  canal  at  our  very  doors 
merely  for  the  use  of  our  men-of-war.  We  shall  not  manage  the  revival 
by  the  mere  paltry  device  of  tolls.  We  must  build  and  buy  ships  in 
competition  with  the  world.  We  can  do  it  if  we  will  but  give  ourselves 
leave. 

There  is  another  duty  which  the  Democratic  party  has  shown  itself 
great  enough  and  close  enough  to  the  people  to  perceive,  the  duty  of 
Government  to  share  in  promoting  agricultural,  industrial,  vocational 
education  in  every  way  possible  within  its  constitutional  powers.  Xo 
other  platform  has  given  this  intimate  vision  of  a  party 's  duty.  The 
nation  cannot  enjoy  its  deserved  supremacy  in  the  markets  and  enter- 
prises of  the  world  unless  its  people  are  given  the  ease  and  effectiveness 
that  come  only  with  knowledge  and  training.  Education  is  part  of  the 
yroat  task  of  conservation,  part  of  the  task  of  renewal  and  of  perfected 
power. 

We  have  set  ourselves  a  great  programme,  and  it  will  be  a  great 
party  that  carries  it  out.  It  must  be  a  party  without  entangling  alli- 
ances with  any  special  interest  whatever.  It  must  have  the  spirit  an;! 
the  point  of  view  of  the  now  age.  Men  are  turning  away  from  the 
Republican  party,  as  organized  under  its  old  leaders,  because  they  found 


APPENDIX  413 

that  it  Mas  not  free,  that  it  was  entangled;  and  they  are  turning  to  us 
Because  they  deem  us  free  to  serve  them. 

They  are  immensely  interested,  a^  we  are.  as  every  man  who  reads 
the  signs  of  the  time  and  feels  the  spirit  of  the  new  a^e  is.  in  the  new 
programme.  It  is  solidly  based  on  the  facts  of  our  national  life;  it&lt; 
items  are  items  of  present  business;  it  is  what  every  man  should  wish 
to  see  done  who  wishes  to  see  our  present  distempers  made  an  end  of 
and  our  old  free,  co-operative  life  restored. 

We  should  go  into  this  campaign  confident  of  only  one  thing — confi- 
dent of  what  we  want  to  do  if  entrusted  with  the  Government.  It  is 
nor  a  partisan  fight  we  are  entering  upon.  We  are  happily  excused  from 
personal  attacks  upon  opponents  and  from  all  general  indictments  against- 
the  men  opposed  to  us.  The  facts  are  patent  to  everybodv ;  \\e  do  not 
have  to  prove  them;  the  more  frank  among  our  opponents  adroit  them. 
Our  thinking  must  be  constructive  from  start  to  finish.  We  must  show 
that  we  understand  the  problems  that  confront  us,  and  that  we  are 
soberly  minded  to  deal  with  them,  applying  to  them,  not  nostrums  ami 
notions,  but  hard  sense  and  good  courage. 

A  presidential  campaign  may  easily  degenerate  into  a  mere  personal 
contest,  and  so  lose  its  real  dignity  and  significance.  There  is  no  indis- 
pensable man.  The  Government  will  not  collapse  and  go  to  pieces  if  any 
one  of  the  gentlemen  who  are  seeking  to  be  intrusted  with  its  guidance 
should  be  left  at  home.  But  men  are  instruments.  We  are  as  important 
as  the  cause  we  represent,  and  in  order  to  be  important  must  really  rep 
resent  a  cause.  What  is  our  cause?  The  people's  cause?  That  - 
to  say,  but  what  does  it  mean?  The  common  as  against  any  particular 
interest  whatever?  Yes.  but  that.  too.  needs  translation  into  acts  and 
policies. 

\\V  represent  the  desire  to  set  up  an  uneutangled  government,  a  gov- 
ernment that  cannot  be  used  for  private  purposes,  either  in  the  field  of 
business  or  in  the  field  of  politics;  a  government  that  will  not  tolerate 
the  use  of  the  organization  of  a  great  party  to  serve  the  personal  aims 
and  ambitions  of  any  individual,  and  that  will  not  permit  legislation  to 
be  employed  to  further  any  private  interest.  It  is  a  great  conception, 
but  I  am  free  to  scive  it.  as  you  also  are.  I  could  not  have  accepted  a 
nomination  which  left  me  bound  to  any  man  or  any  group  of  men.  Xo 
man  can  be  just  \\lio  is  not  free;  and  no  man  who  has  to  show  favors 
ought  to  un. lertake  the  sole:nn  responsibility  of  government  in  any  rank 
or  post  whatever,  least  of  all  in  the  supreme  post  of  President  of  the 
United  States. 

To  be  free  is  not  necessarily  to  lie  wi**.  But  wisdom  comes  with 
counsel,  with  the  frank  and  free  conferflice  of  untrammeled  men  united 
in  the  common  interest.!  Should  I  be  intrusted  with  the  great  office  of 
President,  I  A\ould  seek  counsel  wherever  it  could  be  had  upon  free  terms. 
1  know  the  temper  of  the  great  convention  which  nominated  me;  I  know 
the  temper  of  the  country  that  lay  back  of  that  convention  and  spoke

through  it.  I  heed  with  deep  thankfulness  the  message  you  bring  me 
from  it.  I  feel  that  I  am  surrounded  by  men  whose  principles  and 
ambitions  are  those  of  true  servants  of  the  people.  I  thank  God  "anil 
take  courage. 


NOTIFICATION  ADDRESS  OF 
ALTON  B.  PARKER,  OF  NEW  YORK 

Delivered  at  Indiannpolis,  Tnd.,  August  20,  1912. 

Mr.  Chairman,  Governor  Marshall,  Gentlemen  of  the  National  Com- 
mittee and  of  the  Executive  Committee,  Fellow  Members  of  the  Nominat- 
ing Committee,  Ladies  and  Gentlemen : 

"  The  faithful  sons  of  Democracy,  proud  of  the  record  of  their  party 
covering  a  half  century  of  federal  administration,  welcomed  at  Baltimore 
the  opportunity  to  substitute  practice  for  preaching,  performance  for 
promise.  Indeed,  they  seized  that  opportunity  by  the  nomination  of 
Wilson  and  Marshall — seized  it  by  a  grip  so  firm  that  it  cannot  be 
loosened  either  by  the  hosts  of  Kepublicanism,  or  by  the  deluded  follow- 
ers who  have  not  yet  discovered  that  their  leader's  battles  are  waged  for 
himself,  and  not  for  the  Lord,  and  that  the  contrary  pretense  is  in  the 
hope  that  thereby  he  will  secure  the  Lord  's  hosts  in  support  of  himself 
for  a  third  term,  contrary  to  the  unwritten  law  of  his  country  and  in 
disregard  of  his  pledge  made  to  the  people  to  obey  that  law. 

The  method  by  which  the  Democratic  party  seized  its  opportunity  was 
so  simple  and  straightforward  as  at  once  to  capture  confidence  and 
arouse  enthusiasm.  They  placed  in  nomination  for  the  office  of  President 
and  Vice-President  of  the  United  States  men  whose  records  as  gov- 
ernors, respectively,  of  New  Jersey  and  Indiana,  show  that  they  know 
how  to  devise  and  apply  governmental  remedies — men  whose  lives  have 
been  so  clean  and  righteous  as  to  furnish  abundant  surety  to  the  people 
that  the  pledges  of  their  party  and  their  own  promises  will  be  faithfully 
kept. 

The  result  is  that  success  seems  even  to  the  most  cautious  observer 
to  he  already  assured.  What  remains  to  be  done,  however,  is  to  make  so 
absolutely  clear  the  necessity  to  the  people  of  the  United  States  of  the 
election  of  this  ticket  as  that  there  shall  follow,  not  a  bare  but  an  over- 
whelming majority  in  the  Electoral  College  for  Wilson  and  Marshall. 

It  is  but  one  hundred  and  twenty-five  years  ago  that  a  government 
was  launched  here  in  the  United  States  the  like  of  which  the  world  had 
never  seen  before,  with  a  constitution  providing  for  a  government  of  the 
people,  by  the  people  and  for  the  people  through  their  representatives — 
a  constitution  within  which  were  gathered  those  great  principles  of  lib- 
erty which  had  cost  the  people  of  England  a  five-hundred-year  struggle 
to  secure.  Students  of  government  the  world  over  hailed  this  new  experi- 
ment. From  every  land  there  flocked  to  our  shores  those  who  loved  the 
liberty  and  opportunity  assured  under  a  government  by  the  people,  admin- 

415

istered  according   to   law.      And   prosperity   came   tn    dwell   where   equal 
opportunity  existed. 

To  make  the  road  to  prosperity  level  and  easy  for  all,  free  education 
was  tendered  to  native  born  and  adopted  sons  alike.  On  every  hillside 
is  found  the  school  house  from  which  have  come  many  of  the  leaders  of 
thought  in  America.  All  over  the  United  States  we  have  universities  and 
colleges  unsurpassed  in  the  history  of  the  world,  with  doors  wide  open 
to  every  man — no  matter  how  poor  he  may  be— who  is  ambitious  for  a 
higher  education. 

Our  prosperity  has  brought  us  enormous  wealth.  Our  fathers '  luxuries 
are  our  necessities.  Never  in  the  history  of  the  world  has  there  been  so 
much  comfort  enjoyed  by  so  many  people.  As  our  handful  of  people  has 
grown  to  a  population  of  more  than  ninety  millions,  so  our  wealth,  so 
small  at  the  beginning,  has  grown  until  now  it  is  more  than  double  that 
of  any  other  country  in  the  world  save  Great  Britain  and  Ireland  com- 
bined. And  to  the  wealth  of  Great  Britain  and  Ireland  you  must  add 
the  entire  wealth  of  Russia  before  you  equal  the  wealth  of  the  United 
States.  Yet  there  is  a  great  feeling  of  unrest  in  the  United  States. 
Even  the  people  most  prosperous  and  successful  are  dissatisfied,  and  it 
is  proper  to  explore  deeply  into  our  conditions  to  ascertain  the  real 
cause. ' 

Our  candidate  for  the  Presidency,  the  Honorable  Woodrow  Wils-.m. 
in  his  masterful  speech  of  acceptance  at  Sea  Girt,  put  his  finger  directly 
and  unerringly  upon  the  original  source  of  the  evils  of  which  we  com- 
plain. It  is  the  partnership  between  government  and  privilege.  Trace 
any  existing  evil  of  to-day  back  to  its  source,  and  you  will  find  that  it 
had  its  beginning  in  that  day  when  the  representatives  of  the  people  of 
the  United  States  began  to  help  some  of  the  people  at  the  expense  of 
others. 

I  am  not  here  to  speak  of  the  beginning,  but  of  the  expansion  of  that 
greatest  offense  in  our  history.  It  began  in  the  national  government 
under  Republican  control  and  it  sj  read  on  down  through  state  and  county 
to  the  city  and  the  town — this  partnership  between  government  and 
privilege.  Our  attention  to-day  is  necessarily  confined  to  the  partner 
ship  between  government  and  privilege  so  far  as  the  federal  government 
is  concerned.  If  we  undertook  to  cover  the  whole  field  it  would  take 
many  days. 

First,  let  us  define  "privilege."  As  employed  by  Governor  Wilson 
and  as  I  use  it  to-day,  it  denotes  the  right  to  levy  toll  in  some  form  or 
other  upon  the  people.  Imagine  the  State  of  Indiana  passing  a  law  per- 
mitting John  Doe  to  have  the  right  to  collect  a  five-cent  toll  of  every 
man  passing  his  house.  But  that  is  a  privilege  of  the  same  nature  as 
that  granted  by  the  federal  government. 

Every  man  who  can  think,  untrammeled  by  p!irty  prejudice,  knows 
that  there  have  been  taken  from  the  pockets  of  the  people  thousands  of 


APPENDIX  417 

millions  of  dollars  by   grace  of  tariff  statutes.     These  sums  have  been 
laid  in  the  palms  of  tlu  so  we  speak  of  as  en.joying  swollen  fortunes. 

Democratic  argument  ami  struck'  have  been  consistently  and  per- 
sistently made  against  this  method  of  enriching  the  few  at  the  expense 
of  the  masses.  There  was  a  time  when  attempt  was  made  to  meet  our 
arguments  by  the  representatives  of  the  Republican  party.  But  that 
time  has  passed.  \Ve  need  not  in  this  campaign  detain  the  audiences 
to  discuss  that  fact.  It  will  be  quite  sufficient — if  there  be  doubters—- 
to call  attention  to  the  admissions  of  the  party  responsible  for  this  con- 
dition, and  of  its  representatives. 

We  can  point  first  to  the  admission  of  1908,  when  the  Republican 
party  for  the  first  time  in  its  history  put  in  its  platform  a  provision 
that  thert-  should  be  a  special  session  of  Congress  to  consider  and  revise 
the  tariff. 

We  have  next  President  Taft 's  declaration  during  that  campaign, 
that  his  party  would  bring  about  an  honest  revision  of  the  tariff,  the 
tendency  of  t'n-  to  be  downward.  We  have,  again,  the  assembling 

of  Congress  to  carry  out  that  promise.  We  can  hear  still  echoes  of  the 
denunciation  of  the  tariff  bill  proposed  by  blind  leaders  of  a  blind 
party — a  denunciation  by  the  thirteen  United  States  Republican  Sena- 
tois  who  repudiated  the  infamy  about  to  be  perpetrated  upon  the  people. 
Again  was  the  iniquity  of  the  tariff  confessed  by  its  friends  in  the 
appointment  of  the  Tariff  Board  to  ascertain  what  duties  should  be 
stricken  out. 

We  have  more  recent  admission  from  those  Republicans  in  the  House 
and  Senate  who  joined  the  Democrats  in  passing  bills  reducing  tariff 
rates — bills  the  President  was  compelled  to  veto. 

We  have  also — as  a  last  straw — the  acknowledgment  in  the  confession 
of  faitli  of  one  who  was  but  a  little  while  ago  a  Republican.  Is  it  not 
strange  that  during  all  those  seven  and  one-half  years  that  he  was 
President  there  was  no  power  in  Heaven  or  in  earth  that  could  induce 
him  to  s:iy  a  word  in  K'half  of  the  relief  of  the  people  from  the  burdens 
imposed  by  the  extortionate  tariff  rates?  Tlis  confession  of  faith  admits 
that  certain  interests  have  been  improperly  favored  and  advocates  a 
tariff  commission.  Clearly  the  country  may  expect  no  relief  from  another 
dilatory  board  appointed  by  this  standpatter. 

Let  us  discover  next  what  party  is  responsible  for  the  tariff  as  it 
exists  to-day. 

When  the  Republican  party  came  into  power  in  1861  the  average  rate 
was  twenty  per  cent.  It  had  been  higher,  but  in  1846  Congress  reduced 
the  average  rate  from  thirty-two  to  twenty-five  per  cent.  Ten  or  eleven 
yeais  passed  and  again,  under  Democratic  leadership,  the  rates  were 
reduced  to  an  average  nf  tv.enty  per  cent.  Had  not  the  Republican 
party  come  into  power,  there  never  would  have  been  an  increase.  The 
census  of  1860  showed  that  during  this  period  of  redticed  duties  there 
had  been  a  greater  percentage  of  increase  in  the  national  wealth  than

has  occurred  at  any  other  period  in  our  history,  before  or  since,  and 
that  there  was  a  greater  increase  in  the  percentage  of  money  invested 
in  manufactures  than  there  has  been  in  any  period  of  our  history,  before 
or  since.  • 

Immediately  after  coming  into  power  the  Republican  party  advanced 
the  average  rate  of  tariff  duties  from  twenty  to  thirty-seven  and  one-half 
per  cent.  Within  two  years  it  made  a  further  advance  to  forty-seven 
per  cent,  the  excuse  being  the  exigencies  of  the  Civil  War.  But  now 
nearly  fifty  years  have  passed  since  that  increase,  and  yet  the  average 
rate  of  duties  is  higher  to-day  than  it  was  then.  So  they  not  only  made 
the  increase,  but  maintained  it.  We  have  had  the  Dingley  bill,  the 
McKinley  bill  and  the  Payne-Aldrich  bill,  and  the  average  rate  of  duties 
remains  higher  than  the  Eepublican  party  placed  it  during  the  war. 

So  we  have  no  difficulty  in  determining  what  party  is  responsible. 
There  never  has  been  a  downward  revision  by  that  party.  How  can  you 
hope  there  ever  will  be? 

We  come  next  to  another  subject  involved  in  the  charge  that  there 
has  been  a  partnership  between  government  and  privileged  interests. 
That  subject  is  the  combinations  to  restrain  trade  and  prevent  competi- 
tion, called  trusts. 

In  the  very  beginning  of  tariff  discussion  it  was  insisted  that  the 
effect  of  high  duties  would  not  be  to  oppress  the  people,  because  competi- 
tion would  keep  prices  down.  It  was  the  law  then  in  every  State — the 
common  law  inherited  from  England — that  a  combination  to  restrain 
trade,  to  prevent  competition,  is  absolutely  void.  To  make  the  law 
more  definite  and  certain  and  facilitate  its  enforcement,  an  act  of 
Congress  was  passed,  known  as  the  Sherman  Anti-Trust  Act,  which 
made  combinations  to  restrain  trade  and  prevent  competition  criminal. 
•It  was  believed  this  would  prevent  all  illegal  combinations.  But  the 
opportunity  for  profit  was  worth  the  risk.  Beside,  the  favored  interests 
were  the  beneficiaries  under  Eepublican  legislation,  and  why  should  they 
anticipate  interference  from  Eepublican  executives? 

Prior  to  1896,  when  there  was  a  Democratic  Attorney  General  by  the 
name  of  Judson  Harmon,  he  prosecuted  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  the 
I'nited  States  a  case  in  which  it  was  determined  that  the  Sherman 
Anti-Trust  Act  was  workable.  If  there  had  been  any  effort  by  sub- 
sequent administrations  to  prevent  the  creation  of  combinations  to 
us! rain  trade  and  prevent  competition,  we  would  never  have  had  the 
serious  situation  which  now  confronts  us.  But  the  year  1896  brought 
our  Republican  friends  into  full  control,  not  only  of  the  federal  govern- 
ment but  of  the  government  of  every  northern  and  the  eastern  and  west- 
ern states.  Then  began  in  earnest  the  growth  of  these  combinations  to 
restrain  trade,  which  we  now  call  trusts.  The  grqwth  was  slow  at  first — 
perhaps  a  little  fearful  of  interference;  but  as  year  after  year  passed, 
and  trust  after  trust  was  created  and  not  interfered  with  by  the  federal 
government,  and  as  the  Republican  state  governments  were  absolutely 


APPENDIX  419 

supine  and  permitted  trust  creation  in  the  states,  the  growth  became 
more  rapid,  largely  because  through  combinations  it  was  possible  to 
secure  practically  the  full  benefit  of  the  excessive  tariff  rates.  Domestic 
and  foreign  competition  were  alike  annihilated. 

After  about  four  years  of  tender  Kepublican  rule  the  number  of 
trusts  in  this  country  had  grown  to  one  hundred  and  forty-nine,  and 
the  amount  of  capital  involved  in  stock  and  bond  issues  was  a  little  less 
than  four  billions  of  dollars. 

Su  far  they  had  proceeded  without  opposition.  There  was  adequate 
law  to  cirsh  them.  That  law  would  have  been  enforced  by  the  courts, 
as  it  &lt;  \er  had  been,  if  the  courts  had  been  applied  to.  They  were  not 
applied  to.  and  the  reason  \,as  that  the  federal  administration,  and  the 
state  administrators  wherever  the  "Republican  party  had  influence,  were 
not  in  favor  of  curbing  the  trusts.  Those  were  indeed  quite  comfortable 
veins  for  the  combinations. 

The  Trust  Millennium,  however,  dates  from  the  year  1901.  During  the 
following  ye;:is  th,&gt;y  flourished  like  a  grove  of  green  bay  trees. 

r.y  liiii;),  according  to  a  speech  of  Senator  LaFollette,  four  billion 
do'lais'  worth  of  trusts  had  grown  to  almost  thirty-two  billions,  and 
the  hundred  and  forty-nine  trusts  had  increased  sn  that  there  were  ten 
thousand  and  twenty  plants  in  combination  in  the  United  States. 

We  need  not  discuss  the  responsibility  for  that.  The  Republican 
party  is  solely  responsible.  Do  you  ask  me  why  it  permitted  this  great 
wrong  .'  What  was  the  consideration? 

All   men    in   public   place,  be  sure,   prefer   to   do  the  bidding  of   the 

Naturally    eveiy    human    being   holding   public    office,   if   he   has 

any  heart  or  conscience  at  all,  prefers  to  do  what  is  right  by  the  people. 

But    the    Republican    party    leaders    say    that    their    great    support    and 

strength   was   in   the  captains  of  industry. 

That   support   meant  more  than  a  vote  apiece. 

It  meant  the  backing  of  certain  portions  of  the  press  that  were  at 
their  heck  and  call. 

Tt  meant  co-operation  of  the  leaders  of  finance  in  every  direction. 

It  meant  that  in  an  election  vast  armies  of  employes  would  be  assured 
by  the  real  beneficiaries  of  the  tariff  that  bread  and  butter  depended 
upon  the  success  of  the  party  which  protected  the  industries  from  which 
they  received  their  wages.  ' 

Last  and  most  important,  that  support  meant  that  the  Republican 
at  ion  would  receive  a  goodly  sum  of  money  in  every  congressional 
and  national  campaign  to  help  maintain  the  supremacy  of  organized 
privilege  tin  (High  a  subsidized  party.  Why,  only  last  week  an  ex-Repub- 
lican chairman  of  the  State  of  New  York  testified  before  a  Senate  com- 
mittee that  in  a  certain  campaign  his  State  Committee,  for  his  State 
alone,  received  seven  hundred  thousand  dollars  in  money,  and  that  a 
half  million  of  that  amount  had  been  paid  to  him  directly  by  the 
National  Committee  of  his  party. 


420  APPENDIX  , 

What  did  they  do  with  these  enormous%campaign  funds?  We  need  not 
stop  to  discuss  that. 

Adams  County,  Ohio,  and  its  forty  per  cent  of  bribed  voters  com- 
pletely answers  the  question.  We  all  know  the  same  condition  has 
existed  elsewhere,  if  not  the  same  percentage. 

So  well  was  this  condition  known  that  there  was  scarcely  any  sur- 
prise manifested  when  it  was  disclosed  that  even  a  President  of  the 
United  States  had  not  hesitated  to  summon  another  practical  man — a 
distinguished  railroad  fhiam-ier — to  a  conference  which  bore  fruit  in  the 
sinn  of  $240,000. 

Where  are  you  going  to  get  relief  from  these  intolerable  conditions? 
('an  you  ex|  oct  relief  from  the  Republican  paity?  No :  you  know  you 
cannot.  Did  not  that  party  tell  you  in  190S  that  it  would  revise  the 
tariff?  All  the  people  know  that  the  tariff  was  not  reduced,  on  the 
average.  There  were  some  rates  lowered  and  some  elevated,  but  alto- 
gether all  friends  Vert  still  taken  care  of. 

We  cannot  trust  the  Republican  party  to  change  its  record.  Xor  can 
we  trust  its  nominee.  If  he  were  elected  with  a  Republican  Congress, 
they  would  pay  no  attention  to  him.  When  the  Payne-Aldrich  bill  was 
passed  he  pleaded  with  them  to  keep  faith  with  the  people.  But  his 
party  would  not  do  it.  The  interests,  the  beneficiaries  of  the  tariff,  the 
trusts,  demanded  their  pound  of  flesh  from  the  Republican  party,  and 
they  received  it.  Though  he  should  be  elected  and  his  party  go  into 
office  with  him,  they  would  not  allow  him  to  do  anything.  They  would 
sit  on  him  just  as  they  did  before. 

Would  he  do  anything  if  he  could f  It  is  doubtful.  Has  he  not 
vetoed  every  tariff  bill  passed  by  a  Democratic  House  and  a  combination 
of  Democrats  and  Republicans  in  the  Senate?  His  excuse  is  that  his 
Tariff  Board  knows  more  about  the  tariff  than  Congress.  Well,  under 
our  constitution  Congress  is  the  body  to  revise  the  rates  and  not  a  Tariff 
Board.  And  again  I  deny  that  this  Tariff  Board  possesses  anywhere 
near  the  fund  of  knowledge  possessed  by  those  great  Democrats  in  Con- 
gress who  for  years  have  been  studying  the  tariff — men  who  under  the 
leadership  of  Speaker  Clark  and  Leader  Underwood  have  made  a  record 
for  the  people  and-for  the  Democratic  party  in  the  last  two  years,  which 
alone  should  win  us  this  campaign. 

Now  certainly  there  is  no  perfectly  sane  and  completely  sober  man 
who  has  any  idea  that  the  man  who  created  the  Progressive  party  and 
nominated  himself  for  President  has  any  intention  of  giving  the  people 
any  relief  from  tariff  duties.  During  an  incumbency  of  seven  y&lt;.-ir- 
and  a  half  not  a  word  did  he  utter  in  behalf  of  a  reduction  of  tariff 
rates.  He  preached  a-plenty.  He  invited  the  attention  of  the  _ 
people  of  the  United  States  in  .-very  direction  under  Heaven — in  which 
nothing  could  be  done.  To  the  tariff  statute,  bearing  down  heavily  upon 
the  people,  but  supporting  the  trusts,  where  attention  and  correction 
could  result  in  real  financial  relief;  to  that  very  fountain-head  of  the 


APPENDIX  421 

corruption  which  w:is  slowly  but  surely  destroying  the  best  and  highest 
int crests  of  this  country — did  he  turn  their  attention  there?  No;  not 
by  one  word.  And  now  under  his  gentle  guardianship  the  tariff,  as  ever 
lii't'ore,  would  be  safe  from  assault. 

ruder  his  protecting  care  the  trusts  too  would  be  safe  from  all 
injury.  He  would  permit  no  hurt  to  come  to  them.  During  seven  and 
a  half  years  of  his  fostering  care  seven-eighths — in  capitalization — of 
all  the  trusts  in  the  I'nited  States  came  into  existence — so  we  are  assured 
by  Senator  LaKollette — and  the  number  of  them  increased  from  149  to 
10,200. 

He  could  have  slaughtered  them  had  he  cared  to.  There  was  an 
abundance  of  ammunition  in  the  law.  It  has  been  found  possible  since 
to  hunt  them.  Kven  the  Republican  in  the  White  House  knows  how. 
Why.  he  now  has  but  to  point  a  gun  up  the  tree  and  they  come  down. 
And  no  new  laws  have  been  found  necessary.  There  never  was  any 
trouble  about  the  law.  We  had  ever  an  abundance  of  law.  What  we 
lacked  was  a  man  in  power  willing  to  protect  the  people  from  the 
assaults  of  these  hungry  trusts. 

We  have  had  some  recent  evidence  that  this  fauual  naturalist  had 
no  cruel  designs  on  these  beasts  of  prey.  A  little  bit  of  truth  did  leak 
out  while  the  great  battle  was  on  for  the  Republican  nomination.  Then 
we  learned  that  about  the  first  of  November,  1907,  the  weak  and  pliant 
Attorney  General  was  about  to  prosecute  a  suit  against  the  Harvester 
Trust  for  its  dissolution.  But  a  few  minutes  of  confidential  explanation 
from  the  man  ivho  is  reputed  now  to  be  furnishing  the  ammunition  for 
the  battle  of  Armageddon  persuaded  the  then  President  to  write  a  letter 
to  his  Attorney  General,  which  stopped  the  suit.  And  the  Harvester 
Trust  is  going  yet. 

That  friendly  contest  which  culminated  at  Chicago  was  replete  with 
sallies  and  playful  banter  that  added  much  to  our  gayety  and  our 
information.  It  was  then  we  learned  that  it  took  but  twenty  minutes 
of  heart-to-heart  talk  to  persuade  the  President  to  smilingly  acquiesce 
in  the  swallowing  by  the  Steel  Trust  of  its  greatest  rival,  the  Tennessee 
Coal  and  Iron  Company.  We  had  already  been  assured  by  the  present 
administration  that  the  representatives  of  the  Steel  Trust  did  at  that 
time — in  vulgar  parlance — "put  one  over"  on  our  ex-President.  But 
that  is  another  -story. 

It  is  fair  to  assume  that  the  then  Attorney  General  was  restrained 
in  more  cases  than  these.  But  these  were  quite  enough.  Thus  helped, 
these  "good  trusts"  passed  the  word  to  their  neighbors,  "Why,  you 
need  not  be  afraid;  press  on.  We  have  a  friend  at  court." 

We  have  no  assurance  from  this  trust  conservor,  in  his  Confessiom  of 
Faith,  that  he  has  changed  his  mind  about  the  trusts.  He  does  not  tell 
us  now  that  he  is  going  to  curb  them.  He  says  they  ought  to  be  regu- 
lated. Well,  the  gigantic  corporate  interests  of  this  country  in  com- 
bination are  desirous  of  federal  regulation  and  control.  They  are  quite 


422  APPENDIX 


to  take  their  chance  of  —  most  of  the  time  —  running  the  govern 
rnent.  They  anticipate  {hat  such  regulation  will  be  of  the  sort  the,  Steel 
Trust  had  when  it  was  permitted  to  absorb  the  Tennessee  Coal  and  Iron 
Company..  That  is,  they  expect  to  secure  in  advance  executive  O.  K. 
for  all  their  pet  schemes  and  be  thus  assured  that  there  will  be  no  sub- 
sequent interference  and  no  day  of  judgment.  It  is  so  much  easier  to 
secure  executive  approval  on  an  unsworn  statement  of  selected  facts 
than  to  secure  a  favorable  judgment  in  court  where  all  these  facts  musl 
be  brought  out  under  oath  and  sifted  by  cross-examination.  Financiers 
have  testified  in  the  investigation  of  the  Steel  Corporation  that  they  were 
in  favor  of  regulation.  There  is  a  reason  that  he  who  runs  may  read. 

Be  assured  then  that  if  this  friendly  protector  of  the  Harvester 
Trust  and  the  Steel  Trust  and  the  other  "good  trusts"  should  be  Presi- 
dent again  he  would  never  lift  his  finger  to  curb  the  combinations,  and 
be  assured  that  in  this  campaign  he  will  receive  from  some  of  them  at. 
least  his  full  share  of  support. 

There  is  a  direction,  my  fellow  citizens,  in  which  the  people  of  the 
United  States  may  turn  for  relief.  Not  to  the  Eepublican  party  ;  not  to 
.  the  Progressive  party;  but  to  the  Democratic  party,  which  has  a  record 
of  reduction  of  the  tariff  before  the  war  from  32  per  cent  to  25  per  cent 
and  then  to  20  per  cent.  There  were  in  those  days  ho  combinations  to 
restrain  trade;  there  were  no  trusts;  there  was  no  partnership  between 
government  and  business. 

Again  the  people  of  the  United  States  have  this  assurance:  \W 
present  to  them  the  record  of  a  Congress  of  the  United  States,  a  Demo- 
cratic Congress,  elected  by,  the  people  after  the  fraud  of  1908  had  been 
perpetrated  by  the  Eepublican  party.  With  that  record  we  may  go 
before  the  people  of  the  United  States  and  say,  '  '  Here  is  the  evidence  of 
the  will,  the  power  and  the  intelligence  to  serve  the  people  of  the  United 
States  as  they  ought  to  be  served.  '  ' 

Aye,  and  one  thing  more:  We  have  nominated  for  President  and 
Vice-President  of  the  United  States  men  whose  lives  from  their  cradles 
up  are  each  an  open  book  —  men  whose  lives  should  and  will  convince 
every  human  being  in  the  United  States  that  if  the  great  power  of 
tin  so  two  great  offices  be  conferred  upon  these  men,  they  will,  God  help- 
ing them,  serve  the  people,  as  they  have  promised. 

Governor  Marshall,  the  great  Democracy  of  the  United  States,  in 
convention  assembled  at  Baltimore,  after  nominating  for  the  office  of 
President  of  the  United  States  that  eminent  Democrat  and  scholar,  that 
able  statesman  and  tried  public  servant,  Wcodrow  Wilson,  unanimously. 
sir,  chose  you  as  most  worthy  to  be  his  associate. 

Your  nomination,  sir,  was  made  amid  great  enthusiasm,  and  with 
full  appreciation  on  the  part  of  every  delegate  present,  that  your  ability, 
your  cli;ivacler,  your  valued  public  services,  made  your  name  such  an 
addition  to  the  ticket,  as  that  it  became  perfectly  symmetrical,  abso- 
lutely invincible. 


APPENDIX  ±23 

The  Democratic  National  Convention,  too,  sir,  selected  a  committee 
representing  every  state  and  territory  in  the  Union,  and  honored  me 
by  making  me  its  chairman,  and  sent  us  here,  sir,  to  tender  to  you,  in 
its  behalf,  the  nomination  for  the  great  office  of  Vice-President  of  the 
United  States.  Moreover,  sir,  by  all  the  people  of  these  United  States 
connected  with  the  Democratic  party,  and  of  many  Avho  are  not,  your 
nomination  has  been  accepted  with  such  great  enthusiasm,  and  with 
such  indications  of  complete  confidence,  that  in  their  behalf,  as  well  as 
in  behalf  of  the  National  Convention,  whose  servants  we  are,  we,  the 
members  of  the  committee,  not  only  tender  to  you  the  nomination,  but 
mcst  respectfully,  sir,  beg  you  to  accept  it  for  the  sake  of  the  party 
which  homns  and  loves  you,  as  well  as  for  the  sake  of  the  people  who, 
in  our  judgment,  will  call  upon  your  associate  and  you  to  serve  them. 


RESPONSE  OF 
THOMAS   R.   MARSHALL 

To  NOTIFICATION  ADDRESS 
Delivered  at  Indianapolis,  Ind.,  August  20,  1912. 

Judge  Parker  and  Gentlemen  of  the  Notification  Committee:  Per- 
mit me  to  say  that  it  is  not  my  purpose  on  this  occasion  to  present 
details.  I  wish  merely  to  present  some  general  observations  clothed 
in  home-spun  language  in  the  belief  that  they  may  be  of  value  in 
fixing  the  opinion  and  determining  the  conduct  of  the  intelligent 
voter  this  year. 

Try  as  we  may  to  separate  the  religious  from  the  civic,  the  fact 
yet  remains  that  good  government  has  in  it  an  element  of  morality. 
Neither  constitutions,  nor  laws,  nor  ordinances,  can  completely  divorce 
civil  government  from  religious  sentiment.  There  are  periods  in  the 
history  of  a  people  when  the  conflict  between  the  good  and  the  bad 
may  involve  almost  all  of  the  commandments.  There  is  rarely  a 
conflict  in  which  at  least  the  one  commandment  against  covetousness 
does  not  become  an  issue,  and  this  campaign  is  no  exception  to  the 
rule. 

It  will  be  well  for  the  voter  to  clear  up  some  hazy  definitions. 
We  have  for  many  years  been  entertaining  a  belief  founded  upon  no 
fact  whatever,  that  Democracy  and  Republicanism  represent  different 
ideas  of  government.  The  Republican  has  looked  upon  the  Democrat 
as  a  man  opposed  to  the  government.  The  Democrat  has  looked  upon 
the  Republican  as  a  man  opposed  to  the  people 's  rule  and  in  favor 
of  aristocratic  sway.  It  is  time  for  us  to  remember  that  Democracy 
is  not  a  system  of  government.  Indeed,  Democracy  may  find  its 
exprr  ssion  in  any  one  of  numerous  systems. 

The  rule  of  the  people  is  not  essentially  rule  by  the  people.  By 
their  votes,  even  when  Democracy  has  unfolded  to  full  manhood 
suffrage,  the  people  may  have  a  monarchical  form  of  government. 
The  people's  rule  does  not  depend  upon  the  number  of  votes  nor 
necessarily  upon  the  system  of  government  under  which  they  vote. 
Good  or  bad  government  must  go  back  to  good  or  bad  citizenship, 
to  intelligent  or  ignorant,  to  honest  or  dishonest  electors.  I  venture 
the  assertion  that  if  the  electoral  franchise  were  now  granted  to  all 
the  citizens  of  Russia,  the  Little  Father  would  again  be  crowned  in 
I VI  or 's  City. 

American  Democracy  in  its  purity  was  intended  to  mean,  and  I 
helieve  does  me;m,  something  more  than  voting,  something  more  than

•tin^r  officers.  Like  tlie  sunlight,  we  cannot  see  it,  yet  we  cannot 
see  without  it.  And  like  the  sunlight,  it  has  not  only  bathed  this 
Republic  in  a  sea  of  beauty  and  glory  but  it  has  wanned  and  nurtured 
every  fruitaye  planted  in  the  garden  of  universal  brotherhood. 

American  Democracy  does  not  depend  upon  caste  or  creed  or  con- 
dition, upon  race  or  color,  upon  wealth  ^or  poverty,  upon  success  or 
failure.  But  uneriingly,  it  does  depend  upon  the  inner  life  of  the 
individual  citizen.  It  is  an  inspiration  and  an  aspiration.  It  does 
not  always  depend  i.poii  the  ticket  which  a  man  votes.  It  does 
dop.-nd  alwavs  upon  the  motive  back  of  the  ballot. 

The  historic  Democratic  party  of  America  had  its  inspiration  and 
its  aspiration  in  the  life  and  conduct  of  its  great  founder.  It  is 
time  now  to  have  a  perfect  concept  of  that  Democracy,  for  in  recent 
years  we  have  divided  ourselves  into  three  classes  and  the  classifica- 
tion lias  been  made  i.ot  by  the  heart-throbs  of  men  but  by  their  social 
condition.  We  have  those  who  are  immeasurably  rich  and  who  are 
looking  for  more,  and  we  have  those  who  are  unutterably  poor  and 
who  are  growing  poorer.  Between  these  extremes,  we  have  a  great 
middle  class,  living  well  and  reasonably  content  except  for  the 
uiiceitainty  of  not  knowing  whether  they  are  to  rise  into  the  first 
class  or  sink  into  the  third. 

.\iany  have  assumed  that  only  the  unutterably  poor  and  those 
sinking  into  that  class  were  Democrats,  and  that  the  immeasurably 
iich  and  the  climleis  were  Republicans.  But  these  divisions  have 
not  Veen  logical.  It  was  not  the  outward  and  visible  which  marked 
the  inward  and  spiritual  of  Thomas  Jefferson.  Born  of  the  bluest 
1  lood  in  the  Old  Dominion,  and  accustomed  as  gentleman,  scholar, 
diplomat  and  statesman,  to  all  the  luxuries  of  his  generation,  he  was 
the  man  who  declared  that  all  men  were,  created  equal  and  that  all 
weie  endowed  with  certain  inalienable  rights,  such  as  life,  liberty  and 
the  pursuit  of  happiness.  Kvru  to  his  dying  hour  this  seeming  aris- 
tocrat had  not  a  single  heart-throb  which  was  not  in  unison  with 
the  heart-throbs  of  his  fellowmen.  His  great  opponent  in  statecraft 
spiring;  from  a  lineage  so  lowly  as  to  be  unknown.  With  none  of 
the  advantages  of  either  fortune  or  family,  Hamilton  believed  in 
hanging  on  princes'  favors  and  in  catering  to  the  chosen  few. 

At  its  1  est,  human  nature  is  weak.  The  cares  of  the  world  and 
the  deci  -itfulncss  of  riches  oft  times  stitie  generous  impulses.  Great 
crises  art&gt;  necessary  to  awaken  many  men  to  their  sense  of  duty.  It 
was  because  1  thought  a  crisi&gt;  to  be  at  hand  that  four  years  ago  1 
made  the  statement  that  eighty  per  cent  of  the  people  of  Indiana 
were  Democrats  at  heart  even  though  they  did  not  know  it.  I  now 
or  large  that  statement  and  declare  that  eighty  per  cent  of  the  entire 
country  believe  in  the  historic  Democracy  of  Thomas  Jefferson.  This 
campaign  is  going  to  rid  the  Democratic  party  of  every  man  who  does 


426  APPENDIX 

not  believe  in  its  principles  and  is  going  to  add  to  the  party's  ranks, 
I  hope,  every  man  who  does  believe  in  them.  . 

Men  have  allowed  their  personal  interests,  ambitions  and  preju- 
dices to  sway  their  political  conduct  and  consequently  this  great  body 
of  American  citizens,  thinking  alike  and  feeling  alike  at  heart,  has 
never  been  united  under  one  banner  to  fight  for  the  common  rights 
of  common  humankind.  The  strength  of  those  determined  to  give 
every  man  his  chance  in  life,  unhampered  and  unaided  by  legislative 
enactment,  and  to  strike  down  every  species  of  special  privilege 
inuring  to  the  benefit  of  a  few;  of  those  like-minded  in  their  view 
that  government  is  a  necessity  and  not  a  luxury,  and  that  business 
should  have  its  large  opportunity  for  success,  but  that  this  govern- 
ment was  made  for  men,  not  corporations;  for  principles,  not  interests; 
and  of  those  with  sufficient  courage  and  fortitude  to  drive  the  money- 
changers from  the  temple  of  our  national  life,  has  been  impoverished 
by  desertions  due  to  personal. interests,  ambitions  and  prejudices. 

This  campaign  calls  upon  some  for  justice,  upon  others  for  charity, 
upon  all  for  patriotism.  It  does  not  call  for  the  bandying  of  epithets 
nor  for  an  appeal  to  the  personal.  We  may  safely  leave  to  that 
senile  dementia  which  has  seized  the  so-called  Eepublican  party  the 
personalities  of  this  campaign.  Its  unfitness  to  rule  the  Republic  is 
disclosed  by  its  inability  to  keep  its  temper.  It  was  cohesive  so  far 
as  its  leadership  was  concerned  while  it  was  engaged  in  looting  the 
public,  but  even  its  leaders  are  now  disorganized  while  quarreling 
over  the  loot.  As  for  the  party's  bosses,  the  improper  influences  in 
American  political  life  are  about  equally  divided  between  them. 
Everywhere,  "Boss"  Barnes  is  crossing  swords  with  "Boss"  Flinn, 
and  their  charges  and  countercharges  disclose  greatness  only  when 
we  apply  Emerson's  statement:  "Consistency  is  the  hobgoblin  of 
little  minds. ' ' 

How  comes  it  that  we  have  reached  such  a  condition  of  affairs  in 
American  life  that  the  party  in  power  is  rent  in  twain,  that  boss 
is  charging  boss  with  knavery,  crookedness  and  dishonesty,  and  that 
each  faction  is  claiming  an  exclusive  patent  upon  honesty  and  patriot- 
ism while  avowing  that  the  success  of  the  other  would  spell  irrepara- 
ble ruin  for  the  public?  And  more  particularly,  how  comes  this  to 
pass  under  a  Eepublican  system  of  government  consisting  of 
co-ordinate  branches  to  which  were  ceded  by  the  people  none  of  their 
inalienable  rights,  but  only  such  powers  as  were  thought  to  be 
needful  to  redress  the  wrongs,  preserve  the  rights  and  keep  unshackled 
the  moral,  intellectual  and  physical  forces  of  mankind? 

Though  a  majority  of  the  people  have  been  voting  the  Eepublican 
ticket  and  have  been  assuming  thereby  that  the  majority  would  rule, 
the  disgraceful  but  purifying  scenes  which  have  been  enacted  recently 
in  Republican  conventions  disclose  that  a  large  number  of  those  who 
have  been  voting  the  Republican  ticket  are  Democrats  at  heart. 


APPENDIX  42? 

Tin  se  scenes  disclose  further  that  we  have  been  mistaken'  in  some 
of  our  conclusions  touching  government  in  America.  We  have  yielded 
a  quiet  assent  to  the  proposition  that  a  majority  is  all-powerful  and 
that  a  minority  has  no  rights  which  a  majority  is  bound  to  respect. 
But  now  we  know  that  the  theory  of  the  historic  Democratic  party, 
that  it  is  the  right  of  a  majority  to  rule  but  only  within  constitu- 
tional limitations  and  without  the  usurpation  of  a  single  inalienable 
right  of  a  single  individual,  is  correct. 

It  is  only  when  majorities  thus  rule  that  governmental  machines 
move  without  friction.  The  right  of  a  majority  to  thus  rule  must 
always  be  conceded.  I  wonder,  however,  if  i£  has  dawned  upon  the 
sober  second  thought  of  this  people  that  it  is  possible  for  a  majority 
to  be  a  minoiity  ami  that  it  is  equally  possible  for  a  minority  to  be 
a  majority.  At  first  tlush,  it  would  seem  that  the  officials  elected  by 
the  plurality  of  votes  become  the  representatives  of  the  majority  and 
that  as  such  they  ryle.  But  I  am  not  in  error  when  I  declare  that 
it  is  not  the  mere  number  of  votes  which  determines  a  majority  in 
America,  in  the  sense  of  having  the  power  to  formulate  the  policy, 
enact  the  legislation  and  control  the  government,  and  I  point  to  the 
election  of  1908  for  pi  oof.  The  protest  of  every  man  who  voted  for 
President  Taft  and  who  is  now  dissatisfied  with  the  President's 
management  of  public  affairs  proves  that  for  four  years  a  minority 
lias  been  the  majority  in  America.  At  the  risk  of  offending  the  sensi- 
bilities of  the  Republican  who  voted  for  President  Taft  only  to  be 
dissatisfied  with  his  administration,  I  am  going  to  tell  him  that  he 
is  one  of  the  men  I  counted  in  making  eighty  per  cent  of  the  voters 
ut'  this  country  members  of  the  historic  Democratic  party.  His  present 
protest  against  the  result  of  his  ballot  reveals  his  belief  that  it  is 
not  the  business  of  government  to  grant,  under  the  guise  of  taxation, 
to  any  class  of  citizens  or  to  any  member  of  society  special  privi- 
leges which  are  not  granted  to  ever}-  other  class  and  to  every  other 
member  of  society. 

The  social  condition  which  we  call  Democracy  and  which  finds  its 
avenue  of  expression  at  the  polls  through  our  party,  is  unalterably 
opposed  to  special  privilege  whether  granted  by  the  law  or  seized 
by  ruthless  ambition.  It  is  true  the  mother  of  all  special  privilege 
is  the  high  protective  tariff.  All  who  voted  the  Democratic  ticket 
at  the  last  presidential  election  were  unalterably  opposed  to  this 
system  of  unjust  taxation  and  a  sufficient  number  of  those  who  voted 
the  Republican  ticket  were  likewise  convinced  of  its  iniquity  to  make 
an  overwhelming  majority  against  it.  Save  a  favored  few,  all  were 
agreed  that  relief,  to  a  greater  or  less  extent,  should  be  afforded  to 
the  people  from  the  unjust  tractions  of  this  system.  All  knew  that 
we  cmild  not  educate  the  people  of  America  indiscriminately,  enlarge 
their  views  of  life  and  happiness  and  then  by  the  high  cost  of  living 
deprive  them  of  their  pleasures  without  making  of  American  life  a 


428  APPENDIX 

seething  caldron  of  discontent.  Theoretically  speaking,  therefore,  the 
majority  of  votes,  having  put  a  party  in  power  upon  a  platform^. 
pledged  to  relievo  the  people  of  these  burdens,  has  been  ruling  under 
constitutional  limitations.  But  this  is  not  so.  Immediately  after  the 
election  the  minority  became  the  majority  in  the  sense  that  it  assumed 
control  of  legislation  with  reference  to  special  privilege.  All  the 
members  of  the  Democratic  party  and  all  the  protesting  members  of 
the  Republican  party  have  been  in  the  minority  when  it  came  to 
counting  votes  where  the  count  fixed  the  cost  of  living.  It  may  be 
said  that  this  is  a  mere  accident  of  politics,  a  single  illustration,  and 
that  it  will  not  occur  again.  But  it  is  no  accident.  It  is  only  one  of 
many  illustrations.  It  simply  discloses  the  utter  folly  of  a  man 
remaining  a  member  of  a  party  when  the  party  policy  ceases  to 
voice  his  inner  spirit.  The  Kepublican  party  does  not  recede  now 
from  its  protective  theory.  Its  return  to  power  will  mean  again  the 
rule  of  a  minority  and  the  theoretical  idea  of  -Democracy  will  con- 
tinue to  be  the  practical  aristocracy  of  special  privilege  in  this 
country. 

The  voter  who  cannot  satisfy  himself  this  year  is  indeed  censorious. 
Eliminating  the  verbiage  of  platforms,  taking  their  substance  and 
viewing  the  candidates  placed  on  them,  the  voter  who  believes  that 
the  cost  of  production  at  home  and  abroad  should  be  equalized  to  the 
manufacturer  of  this  country  and  who  wants  an  oligarchy  to  rule,  may 
vote  the  straight  Republican  ticket;  the  voter  who  believes  in  a 
similar  protective  theory  but  who  prefers  to  an  oligarchy  that  the 
President  shall  be  the  state,  may  vote  the  progressive  ticket;  the 
voter  who  believes  this  government  should  be  turned  into  a  socialism. 
may  vote  the  socialistic  ticket;  the  voter  who  thinks  that  church  and 
state  are  not  separate  in  America  and  that  the  people  have  a  right 
to  settle  religious  questions  and  to  determine  by  ballot  what  is  good 
and  what  is  bad,  may  vote  the  Prohibition  ticket;  and  all  those  who 
insist  that  it  is  not  the  business  of  government  to  equalize  the  cost 
of  production  at  home  and  abroad  to  the  manufacturer  until  it  equal- 
izes the  difference  in  the  purchase  price  to  the  consumer  at  home  and 
abroad,  who  believes  that  the  only  equalization  justifiable  in  our 
government  is  the  equalization  of  opportunity,  who  thinks  that  public 
office  is  a  public  trust,  who  does  not  believe  that  disgruntled  and 
defeated  politicians  are  genuine  reformers,  and  who  think  that 
reforms  are  not  born  with  sore  toes,  may  vote  the  Democratic  ticket. 

I  respectfully  urge  all  those  who  are  opposed  to  special  privileg'e 
to  ally  themselves  this  year  with  the  historic  Democracy,  the  corner- 
stone of  whose  edifice  is  the  Declaration  of  Independence  and  the 
keystone  of  which  is  the  Golden  Rule.  At  Baltimore,  it  proved  its 
right  to  be  because  there  it  arose  and  by  its  proposed  policy  met  the 
needs  and  wants  of  a  people.  Am  I  to  be  met  with  the  statement 
that  results  like  those  of  the  past  four  years  might  just  as  well  have 


APPENDIX  429 

been  produced  imder  Democratic  supremacy?  This  I  deny.  The  king- 
dom of  Democracy,  like  the  kingdom  of  Heaven,  is  within  us.  Jt 
comes  not  by  observation.  It  is  a  living,  growing,  vital  principle. 
It  is  as  essential  to  the  life  of  the  man  who  is  a  Democrat  as  pure 
air  or  pivre  blood.  The  power  to  resist  lying  is  not  in  the  mouth  but 
in  the  heart  of  a  man.  His  power  to  resist  larceny  and  murder  is  not 
iii  his  fingers.  Democrats,  like  poets,  are  born,  not  made.  They  are 
born  with  the  fixed  and  unalterable  belief  that  God  made  all  men, 
not  some  men;  that  all  men  are  entitled  to  an  honest  chance  in  life, 
unhampered  and  unharmed  by  law  or  custom.  We  may  separate  in 
language,  church  and  state,  but  we  can  never  have  that  social  condi- 
tion which  \ve  call  Democracy  until'  all  men  living  in  the  Kepublic 
;ire  full,  not  half,  brothers;  until  all  have  been  baptized  in  the  blood 
of  the  spirit  of  the  revolution  and  consecrated  at  every  altar  set  up, 
north  and  south,  in  the  Avar  between  the  states. 

Tpon  whom  does  this  campaign  call  for  justice?  Many  a  man 
devotes  himself  sedulously  to  business  not  because  he  wants  money 
fur  himself  but  because  he  believes  that  jewels  and  luxuries  will 
make  his  wife  happy.  Sometimes,  too  late,  he  finds  that  which  she 
wanted  was  love,  not  luxury.  So,  too,  many  a  man  in  America  is 
devoting  himself  to  the  making'of  money  through  legislatively  granted 
privileges,  not  so  much  that  he  wants  the  money  himself  as  that  he 
\\ants  to  disclose  the  richness,  greatness  and  prosperity  of  the  Ameri- 
can Republic.  Meanwhile,  he  has  not  stopped  to  consider  that  while 
the  few  through  special  privilege  are  adding  millions  to  the  bank 
balances  of  this  country,  the  educated  and  impoverished  many  are 
looking  down  the  years  and  seeing  at  the  end  of  them  nothing  but 
an  open  j^iave  in  the  potter's  field.  The  spirit  of  Democracy  and  his 
inr.ate  sense  of  justice  call  upon  this  man  right  now  to  stop  and  look 
and  listen;  to  review  what  really  makes  for  greatness  in  a  people, 
and  to  answer  in  the  silent  watches  of  the  night  the  accusing  voice 
of  his  own  conscience  which  tells  him  that  it  is  men,  not  money, 
brains,  not  business,  love;  not  lucre,  peace,  not  prosperity,  which  mark 
the  yreatness  of  a  people.  Let  him  answer  that  accusing  voice  by 
resolving  that  though  he  may  not  make  so  many  dollars  in  the  future, 
he  will  not  forget  that  every  other  man's  wife  and  every  other  man's 
child  in  America  are  equally  dear  to  him,  and  that  he  desecrates  the 
graves  of  those  who  fell  from  Lexington  to  Appomattox  and  stamps 
himself  a  coward  when  he  demands  or  receives  the  aid  of  the  law 
in  his  conflict  for  supremacy.  Too  long  have  some  been  the  recipients 
of  money  made  through  the  toil  of  others  and  turned  over  by  unequal 
and  unjns!  taxing  laws.  It  is  good  to  love  wealth  and  all  that  wealth 
can  bring,  but  it  is  better  to  love  the  Kepublic  more  than  ;HI  the 
trappings  of  outside  pomp  and  circumstance.  From  this  good  hour 
let  these  men  fight  their  battles  of  life  without  handicapping  their  less 
foitunate  brothers.  Let  them  hang  pictures  of  Nathan  Hale  in  the-ir 


430  APPEISTDIX 

liedrooms  and  as  each  day's  light  reveals  his  features  unto  them  let 
them  vow  that  as  this  old  hero  thought  more  of  men  than  he  did  of 
British  gold,  so  they  will  dedicate  their  lives  and  consecrate  their 
efforts  to  his  splendid  ideals. 

Upon  who  does  the  hour  call  for  charity?  There  are- thousands 
of  us  who  have  not  reached  the  land  overflowing  with  milk  and 
honey.  Still,  we  wander  in  the  wilderness  of  industrial  despair.  Still. 
are  we  able  to  gather  manna  only  for  a  day  and  still  we  look  with 
longing  on  the  fleshpots  of  Egypt.  Discontent  and  bitterness  have 
entered  into  our  souls.  So  long  have  we  been  impressed  with  the 
iniquity  of  special  privilege,  with  the  arrogance  of  some  rich  men,  witi; 
the  power  of  money  to  produce  peace  or  war.  plenty  or  famine,  that  w-,- 
have  come  to  hate  all  those  who  have,  and  to  believe  that  the  posses  don 
of  money  is  the  mark  of  infamy  and  the  badge  of  dishonor.  If  you 
be  one  of  these,  my  brother,  this  hour  calls  upon  you  for  charity.  Many 
have  succeeded  honestly  in  this  land;  most  have  succeeded  as  they 
thought,  honestly.  There  arc  but  few  who  have  not  cared  how  sii 
has  come  to  them.  Let  us  not  condemn  until  the  sheep  have  been 
separated  from  the  goats.  Let  us  understand  that  it  is  possible  for  tho 
man  in  broadcloth  and  the  man  in  hodden-gray  to  be  brethren  in 
America.  Let  us  await  the  developments  of  a  brief  time  lest  perchance 
the  judgment  of  misfortune  upon  fortune  may  be  injustice,  not  justice. 
Let  us  be  sure  before  we  strike;  let  us  condemn  no  man  unheard,  and 
let  us  give  to  every  man  his  advocate  in  the  forum  of  American  brother 
hood. 

It  will  be  observed  that  the  sum  of  the  justice  and  the  charity  fi-r 
which  I  am  contending  is  the  revival  of  Jefferson's  idea  of  equality  be 
fore  the  law.  not  equality  in  muscle  or  brain  or  will  or  energy!  but 
that  equality  \\hich  guarantees  to  every  honest  ard  industrious  man 
his  life,  his  liberty,  his  happiness  and  his  chance.  Justice  and  charity 
are  always  needed  to  enforce  this  guaranty.  •  Get  into  the  bread-lim- 
it' you  \\i!l  but  beware  in  so  doing  not  to  drive  out  a  weaker  brother. 

I  see  people,  the  most  marvelous  which  has  ever  sprung  from  th&lt;&gt; 
lull's  of  time  and  the  womb  of  destiny.  Among  them  are  all  kindreds, 
tribes  and  tongues.  What  are  they  to  become  in  the  melting  pot?  They 
are  of  I&lt;!  is,  men  with  hopes,  fears,  ambitions,  prejudices.  Are 

tlioy  to  evolve  int"  castes,  not  of  birth  and  lineage,  but  of  sucm-ss  an- 1 
failure!  Out  of  the  crucible  of  these  years,  heated  with  the  fires  of  both 
seeming  and  real  injustice,  is  a  newer  generation  to  be  poured  forth 
to  the  vassalage  of  the  paternalistic  system  of  government  born  under 
Ke[  ublican  misru'e,  or  to  a  socialism  where  success  depends  not  up  i- 
mt'rit  a'nd  honest  endeavor  but  upon  the  mere  drawing  of  the  breath 
of  life! 

It  is  idle  for  a  thoughtful  man  in  America,  whether  millionaire  or 
pauper,  to  longer  play  the  cstrich.  Safety  does  not  consist  in  hiding 
one's  head  in  the  sands  of  either  sentiment  or  hope.  It  is  foolish  for  the 


APPENDIX  431 

vastly  rich  to  keep  on  insisting  that  more  and  more  shall  be  added  to 
their  riches  through  a  specious  sysfem  of  special  legislation  ostensibly 
enacted  to  run  the  Government,  in  reality  enacted  to  loot  the  people.  It 
is  worse  than  ignorance  for  them  to  smile  at  the  large  body  of  intelligent 
Americans  who  regard  themselves  fortunate  if  the  debit  and  credit  ac- 
counts of  life  balance  at  the  end  of  each  year;  ami  to  assume  that  the 
mighty  many,  who  are  becoming  convinced  that  that  social  system  whic'i 
we  call  Derrtocracy  is  but  a  glittering  generality,  will  long  endure  the 
industrial  sj  ivery  being  produced.  The  hour  has  come  when  patriotism 
must  consist  in  something  more  than  eulogies  upon  -the  flag.  Whether 
voting  the  ticket  or  not,  men  everywhere  looking  upon  the  awful  in- 
justice of  this  economic  system  are  becoming  socialistic  in  theory  if  not 
in  conduct.  And  shall  any  fair-minded  man  say  that  if  it  redounds  to 
the  interests  of  the  people  of  this  country  that  a  hundred  men  should 
control  its  business  to  the  good  of  everyone,  that  there  is  anything  fal 
lacious  in  the  theory  that  Government  instead  of  transferring  business 
to  a  favored  few  for  the  benefit  of  all  should  itself  discharge  fhar 
business  for  the  benefit  of  all  ?  I  have  never  been  able  to  convince 
myself  that  either  system  would  not  cast  a  pall  over  human  action  and 
dull  the  motives  which  have  heretofore  moved  mankind  to  the  very  loftiest 
endeavor  and  produced  what  I  conceive  to  be  the  most  perfect  system 
of  government  ever  devised  by  the  brain  of  man  since  that  far-ofi" 
theocracy  of  the  Jew  went  clown  beneath  his  demand  for  the  pomp  and 
splendor  of  earthly  power.  And  yet,  I  do  not  hesitate  to  say  that  if  it 
be  impossible  to  restare  this  Republic  to  its  ancient  ideals,  which  1  do 
not  believe,  and  1  must  make  the  ultimate  choice  between  the  paternalism 
of  the  few  and  the  socialism  of  tli&lt;&gt;  many,  count  me  and  my  house  with 
the  throbbing  heart  of  humanity. 

The  discontent  in  Republican  ranks  is  Democratic  discontent.  How 
much  of  it  has  reached  the  point  where,  wearied  with  the  bad  workings 
of  a  goo  1  system,  it  is  willing  to  topple  that  system  over  and  try  some- 
thing new,  I  cannot  prophesy.  But  I  sm  quite  sure  that  whatever  badges 
men  may  wear  in  America  this  year,  whatever  ballots  they  may  cast  and 
whatever  battle-cries  they  may  utter,  there  are  but  three  grades  of 
citizens.  The  first  grade  is  made  up  of  the  favored  few,  their  hangers-on 
and  their  beneficiaries,  who  think  the  eagle  is  upon  the  dollar,  not  as  an 
emblem  oi  liberty  but  as  an  emblem  of  power  and  who  look  upon  govern 
ment  as  an  annex  to  their  business  affairs;  these  are  they  who  in  the 
last  years  of  Republican  misrule  have  turned  the  temple  of  constitu- 
tional freedom  into  a  money-changers'  mart  and  have  made  of  the  co- 
ordinate branches  of  government  obeisant  lackeys  of  the  jingling  guinea. 

The  second  grade  consists  of  those  whose  outlook  upon  life  has  been 
enlarged  by  the  civilization  under  which  we  live,  who  have  been  taught 
by  the  school  and  the  college,  by  the  press  and  the  magazine,  who 
appreciate  and  enjoy  the  good  things  of  life,  whose  horizon  has  been 
enlarged  and  whose  capacity  for  joy  and  sorrow  has  been  increased. 


432  APPENDIX 

Year  after  year,  they  have  seen  the  boundless  resources  of  the  rici..-st 
country  the  sun  ever  shone  upon  pass  into  the  control  of  the  favored 
few.  They  have  observed  that  the  laws  have  been  enacted,  construe'! 
and  enforced  so  that  struggle  as  they  will,  and  act  as  they  may,  they 
see'  before  them  naught  but  long  years  of  servitude  and  certain  poverty 
at  the  end.  Conditions  have  become  unbearable  to  them.  They  hesitate 
to  hope  for  reform  so  often  has  it  been  promised  to  them  and  so  often 
has  it  been  denied.  They  have  reached  the  point  where,  in  the  struggle 
for  that  which  they  believe  to  be  right,  they  are  willing  to  destroy  the 
ideals  of  the  Republic.  How  many  there  are  of  these  I  do  not  know, 
but  I  do  know  that  special  privilege  in  the  Republic  is  breeding  t-hem 
day  by  day  like  rabbits  in  a  warren. 

The  third  grade  of  citizens  it  pleases  me  to  call  old-fashioned  constitu- 
tional Democrats.  They  are  those  who  believe  that  the  equality  of  man 
kind  does  not  consist  in  an  equality  of  brain  and  brawn  but  in  au 
equality  whereby  every  man,  native  and  foreign-born,  has  an  inalienable 
right  to  exercise  all  of  his  ability  in  getting  on  in  the  world  just  s&lt;&gt;  IK 
realizes  that  in  getting  on  he  owes  it  to  himself,  to  his  family  and  to 
the  Republic  to  see  to  it  that  he  gets  on  honestly  and  that  he  does  not 
prevent  ony  other  man  from  obtaining  the  reward  of  his  honesty  an  1 
enterprise.  These  old-fashioned  Democrats  believe  in  making  money. 
but  they  believe  that  every  dollar  made  should  be  so  clean  that  an 
infant  may  cut  its  teeth  upon  it.  They  hold  that  it  is  no  part  of  govern- 
ment to  boost  one  man  and  to  boot  another,  and  that  any  system  of 
government  which  enables  one  man  to  take  advantage  of  another  is  no*. 
a  system  under  which  a  Democratic  condition  of  life  can  thrive.  They 
hold  that  from  age  to  age,  social  and  economic  conditions  change,  but 
that  the  great  principle  of  the  equality  of  all  men  before  the  law  can 
never  change  while  time  shall  last,  and  that  the  honest  interpretation  of 
this  great  principle  in  statutory  enactment,  judicial  construction  and 
executive  conduct-,  will  take  from  the  life  of  a  people  the  mighty  avarice 
of  the  few,  bind  up  the  broken  hearts  of  the  many  and  loose  the 
bonds  of  all  who  are  in  slavery  to  wrong,  injustice  and  ignorance. 

The  individualism  of  Thomas  Jefferson  is  not  dead.  It  has  not 
mouldered  back  to  dust  in  the  grave  at  Monticello.  It  walks  the  oarth 
this  day  knocking  at  the  door  of  rich  and  poor,  of  wise  and  ignorant. 
alike,  calling  upon  all  men  to  make  this  age  the  millenium  of  state- 
craft wherein  no  one  shall  claim  to  be  the  master  and  all  shall  be  I'hul 
to  be  the  sonants-  of  the  Republic. 

It  cannot  be  that  it  is  the  system  of  government  which  is  wrong. 
It  is  the  unjust  use  of  the  system.  From  Jefferson  to  Lincoln,  the 
Republic  gicw  in  might,  in  majesty,  in  pomp  and  splendor,  and  tho 
humblest  of  :ts  citizens  could  obtain  justice,  not  as  a  beggar  crawlii  _ 
the  sun,  buf  as  a  man.  It  has  not  been  the  use  but  the  misuse  of  the 
powers  of  government  which  has  produced  this  discontent  in  the  minds 
of  men. 


APPENDIX  433 

The  historic  Democratic  party  moves  forward  now  as  always  true  to 
the  principles  of  the  Declaration  of  Independence,  loyal  to  the  Constitu- 
tion and  confident  that  if  men  will  be  imbued  with  the  spirit  of  these  two 
documents  and  will  guide  their  public  and  private  life  by  the  concepts 
of  righteousness  therein  contained,  peace  and  plenty  will  bless  their  homes 
and  come  as  a  benison  to  every  weary.  &lt;lo\\n-trodden  and  oppressed  soul. 

The  Contending  forces  in  America  are  as  they  are  in  Nature.  There  is 
a  centripetal  force  which  is  ever  drawing  the  earth  toward  the  suii. 
There  is  a  centrifugal  force  which  is  ever  drawing  it  away.  These  two 
contending  forces  acting  each  upon  the  other  has  kept  this  old  world 
of  ours  safely  in  its  orbit,  and  springtime  and  harvest  have  not 
failed.  Should  either  force  become  superior,  desolation  and  destruction 
only  could  result.  The  centripetal  force  would  draw  the  earth  into  the 
sun  and  make  it  but  fuel  for  the  warmth  of  other  planets.  The  centri- 
fugal force  would  send  it  whirling  out  of  its  orbit  to  the  northern  pole 
of  stellar  spaces.  There  are  times  in  July  when  we  long  for  the  north 
pole  and  there  are  times  in  January  when  we  pray  to  be  nearer  the 
sun.  But  our  sober  second  thought  convinces  us  that  the  middle  course 
is  the  safe  course  for  the  world. 

The  contending  forces  of  political  life,  are  commonly  denominated 
reactionary  :  ml  revolutionary.  They  are  the  paternalistic  forces  of  the 
Republican  parry,  which  would  draw  our  Government  out  of  its  orbit 
and  consume  it  in  the  fiery  heat  of  the  lust  and  g-reed  of  the  favored 
few,  and  the  .socialistic  forces  which  would  draw  it  away  from  its  con- 
stitutional conception  of  three  co-ordinate  branches  and  from  its  guar- 
anty to  each  individual  of  an  opportunity  to  assert  his  natural  and  ac- 
quired talents  in  an  honest  endeavor  to  succeed.  The  historic  Democratic 
party  of  which  I  am  an  humble  member,  stands  between  these  contend- 
ing forces  and  believes  that  some  harvests  for  humanity  may  be  garnered 
by  proceeding  in  the  old  orbit  which  the  fathers  founded,  by  meeting  in 
the  old  way  each  generation  of  men  as  they  shall  rise,  by  never  forgetting 
that  this  Government  was  founded,  not  for  business  nor  success,  nor  for 
incompetency  and  for  failure,  but  to  guarantee  in  lawful  ways  the  oppor- 
tunity of  every  man  for  liberty  and  for  the  pursuit  of  happiness.  Old 
principles  applied  in  new  ways  will  convince  these  two  extremes  of 
thought  that  our  historic  party  can  make  exist  what  now  is  but  a  name — 
lYmocracy  under  a  representative  form  of  government. 

If  I  -doubted  that  the  return  of  the  historic  Democratic  party  to 
power  would  fail  to  right  the  wrongs  of  industrial  lift?,  to  wipe  out  the 
injustices  of  legislation  and  to  preserve  the  opportunity  of  every  man  for 
happiness,  then  my  voice,  now  weak,  would  be  silent.  If  I  did  not  believe 
flat  in  so-far  as  human  agency  can.  this  party  of  ours  will  promote 
llie  brotherhood  of  mankind,  I  would  here  and  now  repudiate  it.  But 
believing  as  I  do  that  the  Eepublic  had  its  origin  in  an  inspiration  which 
did  not  oome  from  the  mere  brain  of  a  mere  man,  but  sprang  from 
the  heart  of  humanity,  believing  that  this  age  more  than  any  -which  has 


434  APPENDIX 

preceded  it  calls  for  conscience  and  brotherhood  in  governmental  affairs; 
hoping  that  every  sacrifice  of  mind  and  body  and  personal  good  which 
has  been  made,  is  a  guaranty  of  the  -perpetuity  of  this,  the  latest  and 
greatest  experiment  upon  the  part  of  a  Democracy  to  work  out  its  ideals 
in  government;  and  trusting  that  the  God  of  Washingon,  the  founder, 
and  of  Lincoln,  the  preserver,  will  still  be  the  God  of  the  Kepublic,  and 
will  not  permit  his  chosen  people  to  forever  wander  in  the  wilderness 
of  legislative  sin,  I  accept  upon  its  platform,  the  nomination  of  the 
Democratic  party  for  Vice-President  of  the  United  States.  And  may  my 
right  hand  forget  her  cunning  and  my  tongue  cleave  to  the  roof  of  my 
mouth  if  in  all  my  gettings  I  fail  to  get  that  greatest  gift — -wWlom 
and  understanding  to  know  the  heart-break  and  the  need  of  our  common 
humanity. 


MEETING  OF  THE  DEMOCRATIC 
NATIONAL  COMMITTEE 

THE  SHOREHAM, 
Washington,  D.  C.,  Jan.  8,  1912. 

The   Committee   met   at   12   o  'clock   meridian. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  (Hon.  Norman  E.  Mack,  of  New  York)  :  The  Com 
mittee  will  please  come  to  order. 

Gentlemen  of  the  National  Committee,  it  is  unnecessary  for  me  to 
say  that  1  trust  the  deliberations  of  this  body  will  be  conducted  with 
wisdom,  and  that  nothing  will  be  done  here  to  mar  the  prospects  con 
fronting  us  now  so  far  as  concerns  hope  for  the  Democratic  party. 
[Applause.] 

The  Secretary  will  read   the  call   for  this  meeting. 

The  Assistant  Secretary  read  as  follows: 

' '  DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL  COMMITTEE, 
"Office   of   the   Chairman, 

"BUFFALO,  N.   Y.,  Oct.   16,  1911. 
"Dear  Sir: — 

' '  There  will  be  a  meeting  of  the  Democratic  National  Committee 
at  The  Shoreham,  in  the  City  of  Washington,  D.  C.,  on  Monday,  Janu- 
ary 8,  1912,  at  12  o'clock  noon,  for  the  purpose  of  fixing  the  time  and 
place  of  holding  the  next  Democratic  National  Convention  for  th« 
nomination  of  candidates  for  President  and  Vice-President  of  the 
United  States,  and  to  transact  any  other  business  that  may  come  before 
the  committee.  ' '  Yours  very  respectfully, 

"  NORMAN  E.  MACK.  Chairman. 
' '  UREY  WOODSON,  Secretary. ' ' 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  Assistant  Secretary  will  call  the  roll  of  the 
members  of  the  National  Committee. 

The  Assistant  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll,  and  called  th° 
State  of  Alabama. 

THE  ASSISTANT  SECRETARY:  Since  the  last  convention  Hon.  John 
W.  Tomlinson,  the  then  member  of  the  Committee  from  that  State,  has 
died,  and  tlio  State  Executive  Committee  of  the  Democratic  and  Con- 
servative party  of  Alabama  have  elected  Mr.  James  Weatherly  to  fill 
the  vacancy. 

MR.  JAMES  WEATHERLY.  of  Alabama:     I  am   present.

in  this  case?

MR.  BRYAN:  Then  I  move  that  the  credentials  of  the  gentleman 
be  accepted,  and  that  he  be  declared  a  member  of  the  Committee. 

MR.  THOMAS  H.  BROWNE,  of  Vermont:  I  rise  to  a  point  of  order. 
Mr.  Chairman. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:      The  gentleman  will  state  his   print  of  order. 

MR.  BROWNE:  That  the  gentleman  from  Alabama  has  already,  by 
the  competent  authority,  been  elected  a  member  of  this  Committee. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  is  inclined  to  think  the  point  of  order 
raised  by  the  gentleman  from  Vermont  is  well  taken,  and  sustain-;  it. 

MR.  BRYAN:  May  I  offer  a  word?  Is  the  Chair  about  to  rule  that 
this  body  has  nothing  whatever  to  say  about,  and  is  not  in  a  position  to 
consider  at  all,  such  a  question,  but  must  take  without  discussion  anv 
person  who  is  certified  by  a  State  Committee.' 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  That  is  the  Chair's  understanding  of  the  re.sohi- 
tion  adopted  at  the  National  Convention.  The  Chair  has  always  Si, 
understood  it,  and  so  understands  it  now. 

MR.  BRYAN:     Let  the  resolution  referred  to  be  read. s 

The  Assistant  Secretary  read  from  the  Official  Proceedings  of  the 
Democratic  National  Convention  at  Denver  as  follows: 

"MR.  ROGER  C.  SULLIVAN,  of  Illinois:  1  offer  the  resolution  I  send 
to  the  desk. 

"The  resolution   was  read   as   follows: 

"Resolved,  That  the  Democratic  National  Committee  is  hereby  au- 
thorised and  dim-ted  to  fill  any  and  all  vacancies  that  may  occur  on

shall  fill  the  vacancy. 

"THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the

"The  amendment   was  agreed  to. 

"The   resolution    as   amended    \\as    agreed    to." 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Under  the  resolution  jn  t  read  there  is  nothing 
left  for  the  Chair  to  do  but  to  rule  that  the  gentleman,  whoever  lie 
n;ay  be,  when  elected  a  member  of  the  Xationnl  Committee  by  tie 
Stale  Centi.il  Committee,  if  it  is  such,  bei  omes  the  member  of  tie

th&lt;&gt;  ('hair  puts  the  question  on  the  appe-U  from  tin1  decision  of  the 
Chair.  I  should  like  to  inquire  whether  or  !iot.  its  the-e  proceedings  are 
of  a  character  and  nature  to  justify  an  executive  session,  it  would  be 
proper  at  this  lime  to  ask  that  such  ;»  procedure  be  put  in  operation. 
I  move  that  th.»  National  Committee,  pending  its  business  session,  go 
into  executive  session,  so  that  we  may  discuss  among  ourselves  the 
important  matters  which  apparently  will  arise  dining  the  course  of  the 
discussion.

Committee  of  Pennsylvania  has  elected  me  to  fill  the  place  made  vacant 
by  the  death  of  Mr.  Kerr,  and  the  certificate  of  the  Committee  to  that 
effect  has  been  filed  with  the  Secretary  of  this  Committee.  In  calling 
the  roll  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  who  are  present,  the  matter  may 
not  be  important,  but  I  desire  at  this  stage  of  the  proceedings  to  pro- 
test against  Mr.  Guffey's  name  going  on  the  roll  as  the  representative  of 
Pennsylvania.  I  ask  that  the  certificate  of  the  State  Central  Committee 
of  Pennsylvania  certifying  to  my  election  to  fill  the  vacancy  be  pre- 
sented to  the  Committee. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  would  suggest  that  the  credentials  of 
the  two  gentlemen  be  read,  so  that  the  Committee  may  understand  the 
situation.  That  is  all;  unless  it  is  desired  to  pass  Pennsylvania. 

MR.  BRYAN:     Why  not   pass  it? 

MR.  PALMER:     It  will  be  satisfactory  to  me  if  it  is  passed. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :     Very  well.     Pennsylvania   is  passed. 

Mi:.  GUFFEY:     1  am  present. 

MR.  PALMER:     I  am  also  here.     We  will  have  that  understood. 

MR.  JOSEPHUS  DANIELS,  of  North  Carolina:  Pennsylvania  has  been 
passed  over.

Rhode  Island — Mr.  George  W.  Greene.     Present. 

Mi:.    PALMER:      I   rise   to   a   point   of   ovder.     Is    it    not    true   that    -, 
motion  h?.s  been  made  that  th?  Committee  pass  over  Pennsylvania  ? 
TEE  CHAIRMAN:     The  Committee  has  pass?d   it  over. 
MR.  PALMER:      Then  there  is  nothing  noted  on  the  record  as  t  &gt;  any 
body  being  present  from  Pennsylvania. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  Assistant  Secretary  \\ill  continue  the  eallinjj 
of  the  roll. 

MR.  GUFFEY:  I  am  here  from  Pennsylvania,  and  I  want  my  ere 
dentials  read. 

THE  ASSISTANT  SECRETARY:  The  official  roll  of  the  membershi;  &lt;:f 
the  Democratic  National  Committee  shows  that  J.  M.  Guffey  is  the 
member  for  the  State  of  Pennsylvania. 

MR.  PALMER:  AM  I  desire  to  have  the  record  show  at  this  ti:nr&gt;  ;-

election  of  A.  M.  Palmer  to  fill  the  vacancy  occasioned  by  the  deatli  of

sent Tennessee,  but  there  is  a  contest;  and  I  wish  to  announce  that  fact. 
MR.   BRYAN:     Let   the   same  couise   be   followed   with   Tenne  see   t'lat 
was  pursued   in  the  case  of  Pennsylvania. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    The  same  couise  will  lie  adopted. 
The    Assistant    Secretary    resumed   the   calling   of   the   roll,    and    the

THE  CHAIRMAN:    A  quorum  is  present. 

Mu.  HOWELL:  I  move  that  those  who  are  here  by  duly  constituted 
proxy — and  there  seems  to  be  no  contest  in  the  case  of  any  of  these 
proxies,  all  of  which  seem  to  be  perfectly  regular — be  authorized  to 
represent  the  respective  Committeemeu  whom  their  credentials  certify 
as  being  members  of  the  Committee. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the  motion  of 
the  gentleman  from  Georgia  (Mr.  Howell). 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

MR.  DAVIES,  of  Wisconsin :  I  rise  to  a  point  of  information.  What 
is  the  status  of  Mr.  Weatherly,  of  Alabama;  Mr.  Goltra,  of  Missouri, 
and  myself  with  reference  to  sitting  in  this  body  and  passing  on  these 
questions? 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  I'nder  the  resolution  adopted  in  the  Democratic 
National  Convention,  the  Chair  rules  that  the  gentlemen  referred  to 
are  members  of  the  National  Committee. 

MR.  BRYAN  :  That  is  the  decision  from  which  I  have  taken  an 
appeal. 

MR.  SULLIVAN  :    Let  the  pending  question  be  stated. 


442  APPENDIX 

THE  ASSISTANT  SECRETARY:  When  the  roll  was  being  called  the 
question  of  the  right  of  a  State  Committee  to  fill  a  vacancy  on  "the 
National  Committee  occasioned  by  resignation  or  death  was  presented. 
and  the  Chair  ruled  that  the  State  Committee  did  have  the  right  to  select 
the  member  of  the  National  Committee  where  such  a  vacancy  occurred. 
From  that  ruling  Mr.  Bryan  has  taken  a'n  appeal.  The  question  before 
the  Committee  now  is  whether  the  decision  of  the  Chair  shall  stand  as 
the  judgment  of  the  Committee. 

MR.  BRYAN  :    Mr.  Chairman,  I  wish  to  say  a  word. 

This  may  seem  to  the  Committee  a  very  small  point,  but  I  take  an 
appeal  on  this  question  because  our  action .  upon  it  will  establish  a 
precedent,  and  I  am  not  willing  that  a  precedent  shall  be  established 
upon  a  very  important  question  out  of  consideration  for  the  contingencies 
of  a  future  contest.  1  believe  w*  ought  to  meet  this  proposition  upon 
its  merits  regardless  of  whom  it  may  touch. 

This  is  a  new  resolution  under  .which  we  are  acting,  a  resolution 
giving  the  State  Committee  the  right  to  select  the  member  of  the 
National  Committee  for  its  State.  It  states  a  rule,  and  I  am  in  perfect 
sympathy  with  the  rule;  I  would  not  change  a  word  of  the  rule;  but 
the  point  I  make  is  that  when  the  State  Committee  acts,and  the  man 
selected  comes  to  us,  we  as  members  of  the  National  Committee — if  1 
may  say  "we,"  although  I  am  here  only  as  a  proxy — are  not  com- 
pelled to  accept  that  action  without  any  investigation  or  consideration 
or  without  any  rights  on  our  part. 

Let  me  give  you  an  illustration.  They  are  discussing  in  the  Senate 
at  this  time  the  right  of  a  Senator  to  his  seat.  Does  anybody  question 
that  he  comes  as  the  representative  of  the  State  with  regular  credentials? 
Xot  at  all.  Yet  the  Senate  is  discussing  his  right  to  be  a  member  of 
the  Senate.  The  Senate  will  decide,  without  any  man  contesting  his 
place,  whether  he  has  a  right  to  a  seat  there.  Everybody  has  a  right  to 
decide  these  questions.  The  people  of  Alabama,  to  illustrate,  might 
have  sent  to  this  Committee  a  man  whom  it  would  be  improper  for  the 
Committee  to  allow  to  sit  here;  something  might  have  occurred  after  the 
man  was  appointed  which  would  make  it  improper  for  us  to  receive  him. 
I  insist  that  this  Committee  is  not  compelled  to  accept  the  man  without 
the  right  to  consider. 

Every  rule  has  its  exception,  and  we  have  a  right  to  consider 
whether  that  exception  exists  in  this  case,  and  I  have  taken  this  appeal 
in  order  to  establish  the  fact  that  when  these  men  come  before  us  with 
proxies,  the  Committee  has  the  right  to  act,  and  until  it  acts  the  man 
is  not  a  member  of  the  Committee.  I  ask  the  members  of  the  Committee 
to  decide  the  question  upon  its  merits,  because  we  are  going  to  establish 
a  precedent  here,  and  we  cannot  afford  to  establish  a  precedent  that  is 
wrong  merely  because  we  think  it  will  help  or  hurt  a  contest  in  which 
we  may  be  interested.  The  individual  contests  that  will  come  before  the 


APPENDIX  443 

Committee  at  this  time  are  insignificant  compared  with  the  establish- 
ment of  the  interpretation  of  this  rule. 

I  would  say  that  unless  there  is  a  reason  so  great  as  to  justify  the 
making  of  an  exception,  the  Committee  ought  to  accept  those  who  are 
sent  here  by  the  State  Committees,  but  I  insist  that  after  the  Commit- 
tee in  the  State  has  acted,  there  must  be  some  formal  action  on  the 
part  of  this  Committee  before  the  man  becomes  a  member  of  this 
Committee. 

Xow  the  Pennsylvania  contest  involves  this  question,  but  other 
questions  also,  and  this  decision  will  not  settle  the  Pennsylvania  con- 
tent; but  it  will  establish  a  precedent  on  this  subject.  This  is  the  first 
time  the  question  has  come  before  us,  and  I  raise  it  on  the  first  case 
presented  here,  because  if  we  pass  this  over  and  accept  the  proxy  as  a 
matter  of  course,  without  any  action  on  the  part  of  the  .Committee,  then 
it  establishes  a  precedent  that  will  bind  us  hereafter  until  that  precedent 
is  overturned  by  the  Committee. 

I  did  not  like  to  appeal  from  the  decision  of  the  Chair;  it  is  never 
pleasant  to  appeal  from  the  decision  of  the  Chair,  but  when  the 
decision  of  the  Chair  gives  an  .interpretation  on  a  proposition  of  great 
importance  like  this.  I  believe  the  members  of  the  Committee  should 
feel  perfectly  free  to  vote  according  to  their  own  judgments,  and  that 
they  should  make  this  interpretation  one  that  will  stand  in  reason  here- 
after. If  the  United  States  Senate  has  the  right  to  determine  whether 
or  not  Mr.  Lorimer  shall  be  seated  in  the  Senate,  as  it  is  now  determin- 
ing, although  it  is  a  constitutional  provision  which  allows  the  legislature 
to  elect  Mr.  Lorimer,  I  insist  that  this  Committee  has  a  right  to  decide 
that  a  man  sent  here  by  a  State  Committee  shall  not  sit  here  if  there  is 
reason  for  such-action. 

I  insist  that  this  rule  is  like  all  rules:  it  covers  the  situation  except 
where  there  is  an  exception,  for  there  are  no  universal  rules;  and  I 
protest  against  the  establishment  of  a  false  and  dangerous  precedent  in 
order  to  invoke  it  in  the  settlement  of  a  contest  which  will  come  before 
us.  Let  us  settle  this  proposition,  and  then  reach  these  other  questions 
on  their  merits  when  they  come. 

MR.   WOOD:     May    I   ask  the   gentleman   from   Nebraska   a   question? 

MR.   BRYAN  :     Certainly. 

MR.  WOOD:  This  question  came  to  my  mind  just  when  the  gentle- 
man wjis  speaking.  I  ask  it  purely  for  information.  I  wish  to  ask  if 
the  gentleman  in  the  Senate  whose  name  has  been  mentioned  is  not  now 
a  member  of  the  Senate,  and  if  the  proceeding  in  his  case  is  not  one  for 
expul- 

MR.  BRYAN:.  He  may  be  expelled  or  the  Senate  may  declare  that 
he  was  not  duly  elected  because  of  fraud  in  the  election,  despite  the  fact 
that  he  comes  with  a  certificate.  The  Senate  may  decide  that  there  was 
fraud  in  his  election,  and  that  that  vitiated  his  election,  and  refuse  to 
accept  the  credentials  of  the  State. 


444  APPENDIX 

It  is  suggested  to  me  that  the  rules  of  the  House  of  Kepresentatives 
govern  this  body.  I  think  it  is  a  dangerous  thing  to  suggest  that  they 
govern  this  body. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I  would  like  to  ask  if  the  gentleman  to  whom  Mr. 
Bryan  refers  is  not  a  member  of  the  Senate? 

MR.  KREMER:  If  Mr.  Bryan  will  permit  me,  I  should  like  to  ask  a 
question. 

MR.  BRYAN:    Certainly. 

MR.  KREMER:  What  would  be  the  condition  of  the  State  of  Alabama 
if  we  should  determine  not  to  recognize  the  gentleman  whom  the  State 
Committee  now  sends  here?  Of  course,  there  is  no  possibility  of  us 
doing  it,  ,but  if  we  should  so  determine,  would  not  the  State  be  unrep- 
resented? 

MR.  BRYAN.:  This  committee,  just  as  the  Senate,  could  declare  that 
the  vacancy  still  exists.  To  say  that  this  Committee  has  no  right  to 
decide  whether  a  man  sent  here  by  authority  of  his  State  Committee 
shall  or  shall  not  be  seated  is  to  establish  a  precedent  of  which  we  will 
be  ashamed  if  we  establish  it.  We  will  establish  a  rule  that  no  other 
body  that  I  know  of  has  established,  and  will  make  ourselves  helpless, 
and  if  it  is  done  it  will  not  be  done  upon  the  merits  of  the  case,  but 
because  the  decision  may  affect  some  contest. 

MR.  COUGHLIN:  How  long  was  it  after  Mr.  Guffey  was  elected  by 
the  State  Committee  of  Pennsylvania  to  take  the  place  of  Mr.  Kerr, 
deceased,  before  there  was  a  protest  against  his  election? 

MR.  BRYAN  :  It  was  some  time ;  but  that  has  nothing  to  do  with 
this  case.  There  has  been  no  meeting  of  the  National  Committee  since 
that. 

MR.  COUGHLIN:  I  wanted  to  know  the  length  of  time  it  took  them 
to  settle  the  question  of  the  propriety  of  making  the  protest. 

MR.  THOMAS  H.  BROWNE,  of  Vermont:  Mr.  Chairman  and  Gentle- 
men, the  only  body  in  the  United  States  of  America  that  had  the  right 
to  constitute  a  Democratic  National  Committeeman  was  the  Democratic 
National  Convention  held  at  Denver  in  1908.  Prior  to  that  time  the 
Democratic  National  Committee  had  had  the  power  to  elect  a  Demo- 
cratic national  committeeman;  but  evidently  that  was  not  satisfactory 
to  the  Democratic  National  Convention,  and  by  resolution  adopted  in 
Denver,  the  authority  of  the  National  Committee  was  to  that  extent 
limited,  and  the  convention  delegated  its  authority  to  a  specific  body 
that  would  be  continually  in  existence  in  each  State  in  the  Union, 
namely,  the  State  Committee.  When  the  State  Committee  acts  ort  that 
particular  question  it  acts  not  as  a  Democratic  State  Committee,  but 
as  the  agent  of  the  Democratic  National  Convention,  exercising  the 
authority  of  the  Democratic  National  Convention,  and  that  authority 
alone. 

If  the  authority  given  by  the  Democratic  National  Convention  is 
improperly  used,  and  the  individual  elected,  after  he  becomes  a  member 


APPENDIX  445 

of  this  body,  proves  that  he  is  not  a  Democrat,  or  brings  social  obloquy 
or  infamy  upon  the  party,  then  some  representative  of  the  Democratic 
party  ought  to  have  power  to  protect  it,  and  that  representative  wouhi 
be  this  body;  but  it  would  lie  after  that  gentleman  had  had  an  oppor- 
tunity before  this  Committee  to  show  that  he  ought  not  to  be  expelled 
from  a  body  to  which  he  had  been  legally  elected.  To  say  that  gentle- 
men coining  from  these  sovereign  States,  elected  by  the  authority  of  the 
Democratic  National  Convention  held  in  Denver,  shall  be  declared  not 
members,  is  to  declare  that  the  Democratic  National  Convention  did  not 
have  authority  to  delegate  its  powers  of  creating  national  committee- 
men,  and  it  is  to  place  this  Committee  back  in  the  position  in  which  it 
\\;:s  prim-  to  the  passage  of  that  resolution,  a  position  that  was  not  sat- 
isfactory to  tin-  Democratic  party  of  the  Tnited  States. 

There  can  be  no  question  about  the  record.  It  is  not  ambiguous.  It 
does  not  say  that  the  State  Committee  shall  "nominate";  it  does  not 
say  that  it  shall  "recommend."  It  says  that  it  shall  fill  the  vacancy. 
For  how  long?  For  fifteen  minutes.'  Certainly  not.  For  the  time  for 
\\hich  the  gentleman  formerly  a  member  of  this  Committee  had  been 
elected.  IIo\\  can  you  fill  a  vacancy?  By  recommending  that  we  elect; 
the  very  body  that  has  been  shorn  of  all  the  power  to  elect?  It  is  beg- 
ging the  question  to  say  that  it  "nominates"  or  "suggests,"  or  that  it 
"recommend.-;."  It  elects;  and  in  my  judgment  we  have  no  pOAver  over 
its  election.  It  is  enough  if,  after  becoming  a  member  of  this  Com- 
mittee, his  acts  are  so  flagrant  as  to  be  a  disgrace  to  this  Committee, 
that  the  Committee  has  the  right  to  protect  itself.  But.it  has  no  right 
or  authority,  under  that  delegation  of  authority  from  the  Democratic 
National  Convention,  to  add  to  or  take  from  the  authority  committed 
into  the  hands  of  the  Democratic  State  committees  of  this  Union ;  and 
I  hope,  sir,  that  the  point  of  order  and  the  ruling  of  the  Chair  will  be 
sustained. 

MB.  TAGGART:  Mr.  Chairman,  in  order  to  get  this  matter  squarely 
before  the  Committee,  I  ask  that  the  credentials  under  which  Colonel 
Guffey  appears  before  this  Committee  be  read. 

MR.  TIowELL:  Let  us  get  the  matter  straight,  Mr.  Chairinan.  It  is 
all  mixed  up.  The  question  before  the  Committee  now  is  on  the  creden- 
tials of  the  gentleman  from  Alabama.  Now.  in  his  position  are  the 
gentleman  from  Wisconsin  and  the  gentleman  from  Missouri.  Those 
three  vacancies  have  been  filled.  I  affirm  that  there  is  no  discussion  on 
anybody's  part,  and  no  question  from  anybody,  as  to  the  right  of  these 
three  gentlemen  to  occupy  their  seats. 

MR.  BRYAX:    None  at  all. 

MR,  OWEX:    Tt  is  not  contested. 

MK.  IbnvKU.:     Then  why  not   pass  directly  to  the  contested  cast-.' 

Mit.  BKYAN:  simply  becarse  I  do  not  want  a  ruling  here  that  would 
establish  a  precedent  and  make  it  absolutely  impossible 

MR.  HOWF.U,  :    Pending  a  ruling,  I  ask  unanimous  consent  that  the 


44i&gt;  APPENDIX 

Committee  accept  the  credentials  of  the  gentlemen  from  Alabama,  Mis 
souri  and  Wisconsin,  none  of  whom  can-,  vote,  and  each  of  whom  is  as 
much  entitled  to  vote  as  any  other  member  of  this  Committee  on  any 
proposition  that  may  come  before  it.  and  yet  all  of  whom  are  being 
held  up  here,  and  by  matters  involving  and  affecting  other  States.  I 
move  now  that  the  credentials  of  these  three  gentlemen,  by  unanimous 
consent,  be  accepted. 

MR.  WILLIAMS:  I  make  the  point  of  order  that  there  is  a  motion 
pending  before  the  Committee.. 

MR.   HOWELL:     And  yet   these  gentlemen  cannot  vote. 

MR.  WILLIAMS  :     I  know  they  cannot  vote. 

MR.  BRYAX  :  I  am  perfectly  willing  to  have  my  appeal  broad 
enough  to  include  all  these  men.  I  made  it  on  Alabama  because  we 
reached  that  State  first,  but  I  am  perfectly  willing  to  make  it  broad 
enough  to  cover  them  all. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  As  I  understand  this  matter,  there  are  four  or  five 
gentlemen  who  have  been  elected  by  State  committees  as  members  of  this 
Committee. 

MR.  HOWELL  :    As  to  whom  there  is  no  question. 

MR.  SULLIVAN  :  Never  mind  that.  They  have  been  elected  as  mem- 
bers of  this  Committee  by  their  respective  State  committees,  under  the 
resolution  passed  at  the  last  National  Convention.  I  myself  offered  the 
original  resolution,  which  was  for  the  continuation  of  the  old  custom 
of  having  this  Committee  fill  all  vacancies  which  might  occur.  Some 
gentleman,  I  think  it  was  Mr.  Shannon,  of  Missouri,  offered  an  amend- 
ment to  the  resolution  in  the  convention  that  each  State  committee 
should  fill  its  own  vacancy,  and  that  this  committee  should  not  fill  them. 
Wo  are  here  by  virtue  of  the  creation  of  this  committee  by  the  Demo- 
cratic National  Convention.  As  I  understand,  the  roll  was  called,  and 
Mr.  Bryan  objected  to  the  seating-  of  these  men  merely  because  of  their 
selection  by  the  State  committees,  and  wanted  this  Committee  to  act 
upon  their  credentials. 

MR.  BRYAN:  I  moved  that  the  credentials  of  the  gentleman  from 
Alabama  be  accepted,  and  that  he  be  declared  a  member. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Yes;  the  joint  of  order  was  raised  on  that  motion 
that  it  was  not  necessary,  as  I  understand  it.  Mr.  Bryan  contended  that 
it  was  necessary,  because  he  assumed  that  we  have  the  power  to  say 
whether  the  gentleman  from  Alabama  shall  or  shall  not  be  a  member 
of  this  Committee.  Mr.  Bryan  did  that  for  the  purpose  of  raising  this 
question.  The  Chair  ruled  that  these  men  were  members  without  any 
action  by  this  Committee. 

MR.  BRYAN  :    No ;    the  Chairman  simply  said  that  the  action  of  the 
•  committees  made  them  members  without  any  action  on  our  part. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:    Yes,  sir;    that  was  my  statement. 

From  that  ruling  of  the  Chair.  Mr.  Bryan  appealed  purely  for  the 
purpose  of  bringing  up  this  point.  The  question  whether  Mr.  Guffey 


APPENDIX  447 

originally,  when  he  was  put  on  the  Committee,  was  improperly  put  on, 
or  whether  he  represented  or  did  not  represent  the  Democracy  of  Penn- 
sylvania, or  becan-.e  bad  after  he  was  elected,  is  not  up  now,  as  I  under- 
stand. 

MR.  BRYAN  :    Not  at  all. 

MR.  SULLIVAN :  Therefore.  Mr.  Chairman,  the  only  question  before 
this  Committee  now  is.  is  the  Chair  right  in  holding  that  the  convention 
had  the  right  to  say  how  the  members  elected  to  fill  vacancies  should  be 
elected. 

Mi;.  BRYAN:    No;    that  is  not  it. 

MR.   SULLIVAN  :     That   is  the  substance  of   it. 

MR.  BRYAN:  No:  the  question  is  not  on  the  right  of  the  Convention 
to  pass  the  u'solution.  but  on  the  interpretation  of  the  resolution. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:    By  the  Chairman?  , 

MR.  BRYAN:    No:    by  the  Committee. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Will  the  Committee  endorse  the  Chairman's  inter- 
pretation, is  the  question,  as  I  understand.  In  other  words,  shall  the 
Chairman  be  sustained  in  deciding  that  these  members,  five  or  six  of 
them,  were  put  upon  the  roll  in  accordance  with  that  resolution  of  the 
National  Convention? 

MR.  BRYAN:  And  that  the  Committee  has  nothing  to  say,  and  no 
power  to  reject  ? 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Yes.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  the  appeal  taken 
by  the  gentleman  from  Nebraska  lie  on  the  table.  I  do  that  for  the 
purpose  of  settling  this  question. 

MR.  BRYAN:    That  motion  is  entirely  proper. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I  do  it  for  the  purpose  of  settling  this  question; 
that  we  may  get  a  vote  on  it.  I  do  not  do  it  offensively  to  anybody; 
I  do  it  for  the  purpose  of  coming  to  a  vote. 

MR.  COUGHLIN  :  Why  not  withdraw  that,  and  move  the  previous 
quest  ion  ? 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Very  well:  I  \\\\\  withdraw  my  motion  and  move 
the  previous  question. 

•  THE  CHAIRMAN:  •  Tl  e  gentleman  from  Illinois  moves  that  the  previous 
question  be  ordered  on  the  question  of  the  appeal  of  the  gentleman  from 
Nebraska  (Mr.  Bryan)  from  the  decision  of  the  Chair. 

The  previous  question  was  ordered. 

MR.  HOWELL:  In  justice  to  these  men  who  have  come  here  to  fill 
the  seats  of  members  who  have  died — and  they  are  men  whose  credentials 
are  absolutely  unquestioned  by  any  human  being  in  this  Committee — I 
ask  unanimous  consent  that  these  gentlemen  be  permitted  to  vote. 

MR.  BRYAN:  I.  shall  not  object,  with  the  understanding  that  that 
is  not  considered  as  a  settlement  of  the  question  we  are  discussing. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Is  there  objection  to  the  request  of  the  gentleman 
from  Georgia  for  unanimous  consent?  The  Chair  hears  none. 

The  question  is  on  the  appeal  of  Mr.  Bryan  from  the  decision  of  the 


448  APPENDIX 

Chair.  The  roll  will  be  called  on  the  question,  shall  the  decision 
of  the  Chair  stand  as  the  judgment  of  the  Committee? 

The  Assistant  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

MR.  PALMER  (\vhen  Pennsylvania  was  called)  :  I  do  not  want  to 
repeat  this  protest  of  mine  constantly. 

MR.  WILLIAMS:    The  State  of  Pennsylvania  should  not  be  called. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :    Pennsylvania  will  be  passed  over. 

The  Assistant  Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  (when  Tennessee  was  called):  Tennessee  will  be 
passed. 

The  Assistant   Secretary  resumed  the  calling  of  the  roll. 

MR.  TALBOTT  (when  Porto  Rico  was  called)  :  Mr.  Covington.  to  whom 
T  transferred  the  proxy  for  Porto  Rico,  is?  not  present.  I  hardly  know 
what  to  do.  whether  to  ask  unanimoi  s  consent  to  withdraw  it,  or  not. 

THE  CHAIF.MAN:    He  may  come  back. 

MR.  TALBOTT:    He  may  come  in  later.     I  will  let  it  stand. 

The  roll 'call  was  concluded. 

MR.  WILLIAM  J.  STONE,  of  Missouri:  I  have  been  informed  that 
I  have  been  named  as  proxy  for  the  member  from  North  Dakota.  I 
have  no  -direct  information  from  the  member  from  North  Dakota  on  the 
subject.  I  am  informed  that  the  proxy  has  been  transferred  to  me.  T 
am  reluctant,  naturally,  to  appear  before  the  Committee  in  that  some- 
what uncertain  capacity,  and  I  am  not  sure  that  I  have  a  right  to  be 
here.  I  came  in  only  a  few  moments  ago,  and  I  am  not  quite  clear 
as  to  what  is  the  exact  question  before  the  Committee.  I  understand 
it  to  be  that  the  Chair,  when  Pennsylvania  was  called,  there  being  two 
gentlemen  claiming  to  represent  that  State,  ruled  that  Mr.  Guffey  was 
entitled  to  represent  it. 

MR.  BROWNE:  No;  the  appeal  was  taken  from  the  decision  of  the 
Chair  in  regard  to  Alabama. 

MR.  STONE:    Alabama! 

MR.  BROWNE:    That  is  what  the  pending  question  is  on. 

MR.  STONE:  I  thought  it  was  on  Pennsylvania.  As  I  say.  I  have 
just  come  in.  I  should  like  to  ask  a  -question.  I  am  not  seeking  to  be 
in;  I  would  rather  be  out  of  these  controversies,  except  that  I  am  for 
the  interests  of  my  party,  above  everything  else.  If  this  Committee 
thinks  I  am  entitled,  under  the  circumstances  as  I  have  stated  them,  to 
vote,  I  am  ready  to  vote. 

MR.  TAGGART:    I  move  that  Senator  Stone  be  permitted  to  vote. 

MR.  STONE:    I  vote  to  sustain  the  decision  of  the  Chair. 

The  result  was  announced — yeas  ?&gt;4,  nays  33,  not  voting  5,  as  fol- 
lows: 

Yeas:  Alabama.  Arkansas.  California.  &lt;  miiit'criciir,  Florida.  (Jeorgia, 
Jilaho,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa.  Keiitiu-ky.  Maine.  Maryland.  Massa-

Mexico,  Oregon,  Rhode  Island,  South  Carolina,  South  Dakota,  Utah, 
Wisconsin,  District  of  Columbia — 13. 

Not  voting:  Kansas,  Nevada,  Pennsylvania,  Tennessee,  Porto 
Rico — 5. 

So  the  decision  of  the  Chair  was  sustained. 

MR.  TAGGART:    Mr.  Chairman,  I  suggest  that  the  roll  be  called. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :    The  Assistant  Secretary  will  call  the  roll. 

The  Assistant  Secretary  called  the  roll. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Forty-eight  members  have  responded  to  the  roll 
call.  A  quorum  is  present.  Gentlemen,  what  is  your  pleasure? 

MK.  PALMER:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  ^iot  desire  to  insist  upon  this,  but 
I  do  not  want  any  of  my  rights  taken  away  by  non-action  on  my  part. 
When  the  name  of  Pennsylvania  was  called  upon  the  roll,  as  no  name 
of  a  member  of  the  Committee  was  called  by  the  Secretary,  having  from 
my  point  of  view  been  elected  to  represent  Pennsylvania  upon  this  Com- 
mittee, I  answered  "Present."  I  wish  to  say,  however,  that  I  have 
been  informed  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Committee  that  the  name  of 
Colonel  Guffey  now  appears  upon  the  roll  as  that  of  the  member  from 
Pennsylvania. 

I  wish  now  to  enter  my  formal  protest  against  that  action  on  the 
part  of  the  Secretary,  and  to  ask  that  this  Committee  shall  recognize 
me  as  the  member  of  the  Committee  from  the  State  of  Pennsylvania,  1 
having  filed  my  credentials  with  the  Secretary;  and  when  it  is  in  order 
under  the  Chair's  ruling,  I  desire  to  be  heard  by  this  Committee  upon 
that  proposition. 

MR.  BRYAN  :  I  move.  Mr.  Chairman,  that  an  hour  be  given  to  the 
hearing  of  this  contest  from  Pennsylvania,  before  we  proceed  to  act 
upon  it. 

MR.  WILLIAMS:    I  second  the  motion. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  Secretary  will  read  the  credentials  of  the 
gentlemen  from  the  State  of  Pennsylvania. 

The  Assistant  Secretary  read  as  follows:

MR.  TAGGART:  I  rise  to  a  point  of  order.  The  State  Committee  of 
Pennsylvania  has  the  power  to  fill  vacancies  under  the  resolution  of  the 
National  Convention  authorizing  the  State  Committee  to  fill  vacancies. 
But  as  I  understand,  that  resolution  gave  the  State  Committees  no 
power  to  create  vacancies.  I  do  not  see  that  there  is  any  vacancy  in 
Pennsylvania  to  fill,  and  I  make  the  point  of  order  that  there  is  no 
vacancy  in  Pennsylvania. 

MR.  PAUPER:  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  may  be  heard  in  the  matter,  there 
is  nothing  before  this.  Committee  against  which  a  point  of  order  would 
lie.  A  request  for  unanimous  consent  was  preferred  by  the  gentleman 
from  Nebraska,  that  the  Committee  should  give  an  hour  in  which  to  hear 
this  contest. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Will  the  gentleman  from  Indiana  restate  his  point 
of  order? 

Mi:.  T\&lt;;&lt;;ART:  My  point  of  order  is  that  there  is  no  vacancy  exist- 
ing in  the  National  Committee  from  the  State  of  Pennsylvania. 


APPENDIX  453 

Mil.   J'&gt;I;YA.\:     Do  you   objevt    to  having  this  contest   heard? 

Mil.  TAGGART:  1  do  net:  but  1  raised  the  point  of  order  to  brin-j; 
the  question  before  the  Committee. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  The  question  is  on  the  motion  of  the  gentleman 
from  Nebraska  (Mr.  Bryan)  that  each  side  have  half  an  hour  to  discuss 
this  ease. 

The  motion  was   agreed   to. 

TIIK  CHAIKMAN:  Decs  the  Chair  understand,  Mr.  Palmer,  that  you 
\\ant  Id  take  up  the  full  halt'  hour? 

MR.  PAI.MKR:  I  assume.  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  make  the  opening  I 
will  have  the  right  to  close,  briefly? 

MR.  BRYAN:    Dividing  your  time? 

MR.  PALMER:  Dividing  my  time  before  and  after  Colonel  Guffey, 
and  I  shall  ask  for  only  five  minutes  to  close,  because  I  shall  make  only 
a  statement  i&gt;1'  the  matter:  and  I  shall  ask  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  call 
my  attention  to  the  fact  when  I  have  consumed  twenty-five  minutes  of 
my  time. 

Mi:.  GUY  B.  TUCKER,  of  Arkansas:  Mr.  Chairman,  are  we  going  to 
have  a  discussion  of  this  matter  before  there  is  any  motion  before  the 
Committee?  Are  we  not  to  have  a  motion  before  the  Committee  before 
these  gentlemen  begin  their  discussion? 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  In  answer  to  Mr.  Tucker's  proposition,  I  want  to  say 
that  the  member  of  the  National  Committee  from  the  State  of  Penn- 
sylvania is  Mr.  Guffey.  Mr.  Palmer,  who  comes  in  with  later  credentials, 
is  contesting,  under  his  credentials,  the  right  of  Mr.  Guffey  as  a  member 
of  this  Committee. 

Mi;.  PALMER:    That  is  begging  the  question. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  No;  take  it  as  it  is.  The  fact  is  that  Mr.  Guffey 
now  appears  on  the  roll  of  the  Democratic  National  Committee.  Mr. 
Guffey  was  elected  under  the  rule  that  was  accepted  by  the  Committee. 

MR.  BRYAN:    Not  accepted  by  the  Committee. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  The  Committee  held  that  it  did  not  have  anything  at 
all  to  do  with  it.  but  under  the  resolution  of  the  Convention  he  was 
accepted  as  a  member  of  the  Committee  and  put  upon  its  roster  as  such. 
A  year  or  two  later — or,  we  will  say,  six  days  later,  for  I  do  not  care 
about  the  time — the  same  State  Committee  recommends  Mr.  Palmer  as 
the  National  Committeeman  from  the  State  of  Pennsylvania. 

MR.  WILLIAMS:    Elects  him. 

Mil.  Si  LI.IVAX:  Elects  him  in  lieu  of  Mr.  Guffey,  and  in  lieu  of  its 
former  action.  Mr.  Palmer  comes  here  in  good  faith  with  credentials 
from  his  Committee  in  the  State  of  Pennsylvania,  and  asks  that  he  be 
seated.  On  that  subject  we  are  now  to  hear  from  Mr.  Palmer.  Is  that 
the  situation? 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :     Yr*. 

MR.  GEORGE  W.  GREENE,  of  Khode  Island:  Mr.  Chairman,  on  the 
contrary,  is  not  the  question  whether  we  shall  unseat  Mr.  Guffey  and 


454  APPENDIX 

Mr.    Palmer  ?  .   Is   riot   the   question   whether,   arid   how.    a    vacancy 
having  occurred  in  Pennsylvania,  Pennsylvania  has  rilled  that   vacancy!1 

MR.  SULLIVAN  :    Xo. 

MR.  GREENE:    Is  not  that-  the  question  we  must  determine? 

MR.   SULLIVAN:     We  can  do  that  by  resolution,  after  the  coir 
heard ;    we  can  frame  a  resolution. 

MR.  GREENE:  We  have  to  determine  whether  that  vacancy  has  been 
filled,  and  how.  Every  case  that  conies  before  thip  Committee  we  must 
decide,  if  there  is  a  contest.  If  two  State  Committees,  both  existing  at 
the  same  time  in  a  State,  for  instance,  have  attempted  to  fill  a  vacancy. 
we  must  decide  which  one  has  filled  it.  If  there  has  been  an  atteaipt  to 
fill  it  by  a  Committee  that  has  not  been  regularly  constituted  and 
called,  we  must  decide  that  question. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    That  is  true. 

Mi;.  GREENE:  So  the  question  here  with  regard  to  the  vacancy  in 
Pennsylvania  is  not  whether  it  has  been  properly  filled,  but  whether 
it  has  been  filled,  and  how? 

MR.  BRYAN:  After  we  have  heard  this  case  we  will  then  frame  a 
resolution. 

MR.  GREENE:     Exactly. 

(The  Pennsylvania  contest  was  then  argued  by  Mr.  Palmer,  for  him- 
self, for  twenty-five  minutes,  and  by  Senator  Dewalt,  of  Philadelphia, 
for  Colonel  Guffey,  for  thirty  minutes,  Mr.  Palmer  having  a  five-minute 
rejoinder.) 

MR.  JOHN  T.  McGRAW,  of  West  Virginia:  Mr.  Chairman,  it  occurs 
to  me  we  are  losing  very  valuable  time  here.  We  have  invited  a  great 
number  of  gentlemen  from  different  cities  to  come  here  and  present 
their  claims  to  be  selected  as  the  city  in  which  shall  be  held  the  next 
National  Convention,  and  for  the  purpose  of  presenting  this  case  and 
having  it  settled  promptly,  I  offer  a  resolution: 

"Resolved,  that  the  action  of  the  Chairman  and  Secretary  of  this 
&lt;  'ommittee  in  placing  the  name  of  James  M.  Guffey  upon  its  roster  to 

oed  James  Kerr,  deceased,  be  and  the  same  is  hereby  ratified,  con- 
firmed and  approved. ' ' 

MR.  DANIELS:  As  a  substitute  for  that  I  offer  a  resolution  that  the 
Honorable  A.  Mitchell  Palmer  was  legally  elected  a  member  of  this 
Committee  from  Pennsylvania. 

^!R.  HOWELL:    I  move  the  previous  question. 

(The   Pennsylvania   contest   was   thereupon   further   debated   by   Mr. 

Miy:in,    Mr.    Saulsbury,    Mr.    Williams,    Mr.    Browne.    Mr.    Wood.    Mr. 

HP.  Mr.  Coughlin,  Mr.  Cummings,  Senator  Stone  and  Mr.  Kremer.) 

THE  i  HAIRMAX:  Mr.  McGraw  has  moved  that  tjie  Chairman  and 
the  Secretary  be  sustained  in  placing  the  name  of  Colonel  Guffey  on 
the  roll.  Mr.  Daniels  offered  as  a  substitute  that  Mr.  Palmer  now  be 
placed  on  the  roll.  The  vote  will  first  be  taken  on  Mr.  Daniel's  sub- 
stitute. 


APPENDIX  455 

MR.  WILLIAMS:  As  I  understand,  then,  Mr.  Chairman,  those  who 
are  in  favor  of  seating  Mr.  Palmer  will  vote  "yea"  and  those  opposed 
will  vote  ' '  nay. ' ' 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :     Yes';   the  Assistant   Secretary  will  call  the  roll. 

The  Assistant  Secretary  proceeded  to  call  the  roll. 

The  result  was  announced:  Yeas  IS.  nays  30.  not  voting  4,  as 
follows : 

Yeas:  Alabama,  Colorado,  Delaware.  Iowa,  Louisiana,  Mississippi, 
Nebraska,  New  Jersey,  North  Carolina.  Ohio.  Oregon,  South  Carolina, 
South  Dakota.  Utah.  Washington,  Wisconsin.  Wyoming,  District  of 
Columbia — 18. 

Nays:  Arkansas,  California.  Connecticut,  Florida,  Georgia,  Idaho, 
Illinois,  Indiana,  Kentucky.  Maine,  Maryland,  Massachusetts,  Michigan, 
Minnesota.  Missouri.  Montana,  New  Hampshire,  New  Mexico.  New 
Yiork,  North  Dakota,  Oklahoma,  Ehode  Island,  Tennessee,  Texas,  Ver- 
mont, Virginia.  West  Virginia,  Alaska.  Arizona.  Hawaii — 30. 

Not  voting:    Kansas.  Nevada,  Pennsylvania,  Porto  Rico- — 4. 

So  Mr.  Daniels'  substitute  was  rejected. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  recurs  on  agreeing  to  the  resolution 
offered  by  the  gentleman  from  West  Virginia  (Mr.  McGraw). 

The  resolution  was  agreed  to. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     What   is  the  pleasure  of  the  Committee? 

MR.  DANIELS:  1  move  that  R.  K.  L.  Mountcastle  be  declared  a  mem- 
ber of  this  Committee  from  Tennessee. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  before  the  Committee  is  the  motion 
made  by  Mr.  Daniels,  of  North  Carolina,  that  Mr.  R.  E.  L.  Mouutcastle 
be  retained  as  a  member  of  the  Democratic  National  Committee. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

Mu.  TAGGART:     I  move  that  the  Committee  proceed  in  open  session. 

The  motion   was  agreed  to. 

OPEN  SESSION. 

MR.  HOWELL:  1  make  the  usual  and  customary  motion  that  the 
Chair  appoint  a  Committee  on.  Resolutions,  composed  of  five  members, 
to  which  any  resolution  that  may  be  offered  may  be  referred  for  report 
to  this  Committee. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to,  and  the  Chair  appointed  as  the  Commit- 
tee Mr.  Howell,  of  Georgia;  Mr.  Cummings,  of  Connecticut;  Mr. 
Brady,  of  Oklahoma;  Mr.  Browne,  of  Vermont,  and  Mr.  McGraw,  of 
Wr-t  Virginia. 

MR.  TALBOTT:  Call  the  roll  for  resolutions  and  then  let  us  take  a 
recess  until  5  o'clock. 

The  Assistant  Secretary  called  the  roll,  and  as  the  States  were  called 
resolutions  were  handed  to  the  Assistant  Secretary. 

MR.  TAGGART:  I  move  that  the  Chair  appoint  a  committee  to  pre- 
pare suitable  resolutions  with  respect  to  the  memory  of  the  several 


456  APPENDIX 

members  of  the  National  Committee  who  have  died  since  our  last  meet- 
ing, and  that  it  report  at  an  adjourned  meeting. 

The  motion  was  unanimously  agreed  to,  and  the  Chairman  appointed 
as  the  committee  Mr.  Weatherly,  of  Alabama;  Mr.  Goltra,  of  Missouri; 
Mr.  Daniels,  of  North  Carolina,  and  Mr.  Davies,  of  Wisconsin. 

MR.  ELLYSON:  I  move  that  the  Committee  take  a  recess  until  5 
o  'clock  p.  m. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the  motion  that  the 
Committee  take  a  recess  until  5  o'clock  p."  m. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

AFTER  RECESS. 

At  the  expiration  of  the  recess  the  Committee  reassembled.

of  the  cities  be  advised  that  the  Committee  will  hear  them  tomorrow  at 
11  o'clock  a.  m. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to,  and  at  5  o'clock  and  2  minutes  p.  m. 
the  Committee  adjourned  until  tomorrow,  Tuesday,  January  9,  1912,  at

The  first  order  of  business  is  the  fixing  of  a  date  for  holding  the  Con-

APPENDIX  457 

MR.  LYNCH,  of  Minnesota:  I  move  that  the  Convention  of  the  Demo 
ciatie  party  be  held,  beginning  June  J-'ili.  l!Vll_'. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

THE  CHAIRMAN':  It  is  now  in  order  to  determine  the  city  in  which 
the  Convention  is  to  be  held.  How  much  time  each  city  shall  have  is  a 
proper  matter  now  to  l&gt;e  ay  reed  upon.  Is  there  any  surest  ion  in  that 
respect  f 

MR.  LYNCH:  1  move  that  each  city  lie  given  thirty  ininntis.  ami 
that  it  be  limited  to  two  speakers  on  each  side. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

Therein  on  the  claims  of  Denver  were  presented  by  Mr.  Chas.  W. 
Franklin  and  Mr.  George  F.  Knifton;  of  Chicago,  by  Mr.  Frederic  W. 
r]iham.  Mr.  James  Hamilton  Lewis  and  Mr.  Charles  Hermann;  of 
Baltimore,  by  Mr.  J.  F.  C.  Talbott.  Mr.  O.  F.  Hershey,  Mr.  James  S. 
Preston  and  Mr.  Isador  Uayner;  of  St.  Louis,  by  Mr.  Eolla  Wells,  Mr. 
•lames  E.  Smith  and  Mr.  D.  E.  Francis;  of  New  York,  by  Mr.  Kdward

MR.  TAGGART:  If  there  are  no  other  cities  to  be  heard  from,  I 
move  that  the  Committee  go  into  executive  session. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to,  and  (at  2  o'clock)  the  Committee  went 
into  executive  session. 

PROCKKDIXGS  IX   EXECUTIVE   SESSION. 

MR.  DANIELS:  Mr.  Chairman,  as  we  have  heard  the  claims  of  the 
different  cities,  I  move  that  the  roll  be  called  and  we  take  a  vote  upon 
the  city  to  be  selected  for  the  coming  Convention. 

MR.  TAGGART:  Does  the  Chair  know  the  proposition  that  each  city 
has  made? 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    No. 

MR.  TAGGART:  I  think  the  proposition  that  each  city  makos  should 
be  in  the  hands  of  the  Chair  before  we  proceed  to  the  ballot. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I  think  so.  too.  I  think  we  should  know  exactly 
what  proposition  each  city  makes  before  we  vote. 

MR.  GABBER:  I  move  that  the  Chairman  and  Secretary  and  Treas- 
urer of  the  National  Committee  look  over  these  propositions  and  report 
in  five  minutes. 

MR.  HcnvELL:  Will  you  permit  ir.e  to  make  a  suggestion  to  the 
Committee?  If  you  go  on  with  this  roll  call  now,  everybody  will  nat- 
urally conclude  that  the  business  is  over,  and  there  will  probably  be  a 
motion  to  adjourn,  while,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  there  is  other  business  to 
be  attended  to.  This  Committee  has  not  even  authorized  a  call  for  the 
National  Convention,  no  resolution  covering  that  having  been  paesi'd.  If 
you  select  a  city  and  adjourn,  the  Chairman  would  have  no  authority  even 
to  call  the  National  Convention.  While  the  Secretary  is  getting  this 
matter  in  sha|  e.  I  will  present  some  resolutions  which  will  take  only  a 
few  minutes.  lx&gt;t  us  dispose  of  these  n  solutions.  Let  us  give  the 


458  A  L'PENDIX 

Chairman  authority  to  call  the  Convention  and  do  whatever  is  necessary 
in  the  way  of  resolutions.  In  the  meantime,  let  the  Secretary  of  the 
Committee  get  in  writing  a  brief  statement  from  each  of  the  four  cities 
as  to  just  what  they  propose. 

.Mi;.  GARBER:  I  will  withdraw  my  motion  and  second  the  motion  of 
Mr.  Ho  well. 

MR.  HOWELL:  My  motion  is  that  the  Chairman,  Secretary  and  Treas- 
urer get  these  statements  in  writing  and  report  in  ten  minutes. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

The  gentlemen  appointed  retired,  Mr.  Taggart  taking  the  chair. 

MR.  HOWELL:    I  move  that  we  now  proceed  in  open  session. 

The  motion   was  agreed  to. 

OPEN  SESSION. 

MR.  JONES,  of  Maine;    Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  something  to  offer. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  Taggart  in  the  chair) :  As  soon  as 
Mr.  Howell  is  through  we  will  hear  you,  Mr.  Jones. 

MR.  HOWELL:  Mr. 'Chairman,  the  Committee  at  its  meeting  yesterday 
authorized  the  appointment  of  a  Committee  on  Resolutions,  to  whom 
should  be  referred  all  resolutions  introduced.  Quite  a  number  of  reso- 
lutions were  accordingly  introduced  and  submitted  to  the  Committee, 
which  consisted  of  Messrs.  Cummings,  of  Connecticut;  Brady,  of  Okla 
honia;  Browne,  of  Vermont;  McGraw,  of  West  Virginia,  and  myself  as 
chairman. 

Of  these  resolutions,  quite  a  number  bore  upon  the  question  of 
direct  primaries.  Senator  Chamberlain,  of  Oregon,  introduced  one,  and 
several  others  were  introduced  along  the  same  line. 

Your  committee  took  into  consideration  these  various  resolutions, 
and  after  conference  with  Senator  Chamberlain,  have  agreed  upon  a 
report,  not  making  it  mandatory,  but  leaving  it.  optional  with  such 
State  committees  as  may  desire  to  do  so  to  call  direct  primaries,  if  in 
their  wisdom  they  see  fit  to  do  so. 

Your  committee  has  accordingly  reported  this  resolution,  which  I 
think  covers  the  situation  very  fully,  and  which  is  eminently  satisfactory 
to  Senator  Chamberlain,  who  introduced  the  resolution.  I  think  and 
trust  it  will  meet  the  approval  of  the  whole  Committee,  as  it  does  the 
unanimous  approval  of  the  Committee  on  Resolutions.  It  embodies  in 
it  the  formal  authority,  of  course,  to  the  Chairman  to  call  the  National 
Convention : 

"Resolved,  that  the  Chairman  of  the  Democratic  National  Com- 
mittee be,  and  he  is  hereby,  directed  to  call  a  National  Convention  of 
the  party,  to  be  held  during  the  year  1912  at  such  time  and  place  as  may 
this  day  be  agreed  upon. 

"Sesolved,  further,  that  the  basis  of  representation  at  such  National 
Convention  shall  l&gt;o  two  delegates  for  each  Senator  and  Representative 
from  the  respective  States,  under  the  Congressional  .reapportiomnent 


AlM'KMHX  -1")!' 

based  on  the  Census  of  liiln.  and  the  District  of  _Coluinbia,  the  Philip- 
pines. Hawaii.  Porto  Rico  and  Alaska  shall  he  entitled  to  six  delegates 
each. 

That  follows  the  usual  form  and  is  the  usual  allotment  of  delegate- 
to  the  States  and  Territories. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the  resolu- 
tion reported  by  the  gentleman  from  Georgia. 

The  resolution   was  agreed  to. 

MR.  HOWFLL:  The  committee  al«o  offeis  tJie  following: 
' ' Besolved,  that  in  the  choice  of  delegatis  and  alternates  to  the  Demo- 
cratic National  Convention  of  191:.'.  the  Democratic  State  or  Territorial 
Committees  may.  if  not  otherwise  directed  by  the  law  of  such  States  or 
Territories,  provide  for  the  direct  election  of  such  delegates  or  alternates, 
if  in  the  opinion  of  the  respective  committees  it  is  deemed  desirable  to 
do  so.  Where  such  provision  is  not  made  by  the  respective  committees 
for  the  choice  of  delegates  and  alternates,  and  where  the  State  laws 
do  not  pnnidi  specifically  the  manner  of  such  choice,  then  the  delegates 
and  the  alternates  to  the  said  National  Convention  shall  be  chosen  in  the 
manner  that  governed  the  choice  of  delegates  from  the  respective  States 
and  Territories  to  the  last  Democratic  National  Convention." 

I  move  the  adoption  of  the  resolution. 

MR.  .IOHXSTOX.  of  Texas:  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  not  disposed  to  antag- 
onize the  resolution  as  a  whole,  and  I  am  not  going  to  do  so;  but  I 
should  like  to  suggest  to  this  Committee  that  so  far  as  concerns  the  man- 
ner and  method  of  electing  the  delegates  to  the  National  Convention,  it 
is  purely  a  State  matter,  and  I  think  it  would  be  presumption  on  our  part 
to  eve&gt;  &gt;r  request  how*  they  should  be  selected. 

MR.  HOWELL:    It  does  not  do  that. 

MR.  .IOHXSTOX.  of  Texas:  I  know  yon  mean  to  qualify  it,  but  it 
cairies  with  it  the  idea  that  the  National  Committee  assumes  to  tell  the 
State  how  it  shall  conduct  its  internal  affairs. 

MR.  HOWELL:    T  1  eg  to  differ  with  my  friend  from  T' 

MR.  .IOHXSTOX.  of  Texas:  I  understand  how  you  have  framed  it, 
and  T  understand  the  motive  in  framing  it  that  way. 

MR.   HOWELL:     We  rse  the  word  ' '  may "  :     it   is  absolutely   optional. 

MR.  .IOHXSTOX.  of  Texas:  In  other  words,  we.  as  the  National  Com- 
mittee, tell  the  State  it  may  do  so  if  it  wants  to.  ft  is  none  of  our 
busim  88. 

MR.    HOWK.I.L:     This  will   do  the   partf  good,   esj  ecially   in   the   States 
tin-  Mississippi  River.     We  exj  ect  to  carry  quite  a  number  of  the 
in  the  West,  and  if  tluse  men.  who  have  labored  long  and  honora- 
bly for  the  party  and  who  are  establishing  for   it   a   prestige  in  the   West 
as  it  has  never  been  established   before,  come  to  us  and  tell  us  that  the 
adoption    of    a    simple    resolution    of    this    sort    will    do    the    party    good 
in    those   States,   then    I   think   we   ought    at    least    tn    give    them    the   con- 
sideration »f  acting  favorably  upon  their  suggestion. 


460  APPENDIX 

Mi;.  ADAMS:  The  system  is  not  only  allowed,  but  in  some  States  it 
is  obligatory.  We  say  all  States  ought  to  be  allowed  to  do  the  sanje 
thing. 

MR.  JOHNSTON,  of  Texas:  Why  does  the  Committee  want  to  say 
anything  at  all  about  it! 

MB.  HOWELL:  The  resolution  says  where  such  provision  is  not  made, 
' '  and  where  the  State  laws  do  not  provide  specifically  the  manner  of  such 
choice,  then  the  delegates  and  the  alternates  to  the  said  National  Con- 
vention shall  be  chosen  in  the  manner  that  governed  the  choice  of  dele- 
gates from  the  respective  States  and  Territories  to  the  last  Democratic 
National  Convention."  That  is  simply  the  usual  phrase. 

MR.  JOHNSTON,  of  Texas:  The  point  I  am  making  is  this:  I  do  not 
care  anything  about  the  resolution.  It  does  not  amount  to  any  more 
than  the  paper  it  is  written  on.  so  far  as  the-  States  are  concerned,  but 
the  point  is  this:  The  election  of  the  delegates  is  a  matter  for  each 
State,  and  bringing  in  a  question  of  seeming  dictation  on  the  part  of 
the  Committee  to  a  State  by  saying  even  that  they  may  do  a  thing  if 
they  want  to — in  other  words,  Mr.  Chairman,  if  a  State  wants  to  do  a 
certain  thing,  it  has  our  permission  to  do  it — is  something  I  do  not 
believe  this  Committee  ought  to  do.  I  do  not  think  the  Committee 
ought  to  say  anything  of  the  sort. 

MR.  GEORGE  E.  CHAMBERLAIN,  of  Oregon:  The  advantage  that  may 
be  derived  by  our  party  by  the  adoption  of  this  resolution  is  accentuated 
by  the  course  of  the  Republican  National  Committee  when  they  met. 
They  not  only  refused  to  recognize  the  right  of  the  States  to  pass  laws 
governing  the  election  of  delegates,  but  they  practically  said  that  in 
those  States  which  had  provided  for  the  election  of  delegates  by  direct 
vote,  those  delegates  would  be  turned  down  when  they  presented  them- 
selves, if  the  National  Convention  saw  fit  to  do  so. 

In  other  words,  they  said,  if  the  Convention  deemed  it  wise  to  apply 
such  a  process,  they  could  proceed  by  that  process,  notwithstanding  the 
law  of  the  State  providing  for  a  direct  vote  by  the  people.  That  has 
been  severely  condemned  throughout  the  length  and  breadth  of  the 
country,  and  properly  so,  because  the  Western  States  particularly — I  am 
safe  in  saying  that,  and  some  of  the  Southern  States,  too — are  going 
a  step  further,  and  providing  by  their  State  laws  for  the  election  of  dele- 
gates direct  to  the  Convention.  As  Benton  and  as  Jackson  said,  they 
are  bringing  these  conventions  close  to  the  people.  So  I  think  that  as 
a  party  w«&gt;  &gt;-nn  gain  strength  among  the  independent  voters  of  the  coun- 
try by  doin^  what  Jackson  said  we  .ought  to  do — bring  these  delegates 
as  near  to  the  people  as  possible. 

MR.  JOHNSTON,  of  Texas:  In  order  to  end  the  discussion,  I  will 
withdraw  my  objection  and  let  it  go. 

MK.  WOOD:  This  matter  is  of  some  importance  to  me  and  my  State. 
I  am  not  at  all  opposed  to  the  primary;  at  least  I  am  not  going  to 
oppose  the  resolution;  but  I  want  it  properly  safeguarded.  I  want  it 


APPENDIX  461 

safeguarded  by  law.  I  am  going  to  propose  a  little  amendment.  I 
agree  with  Mr.  Johnston  that  it  does  not  amount  to  anything,  anyway; 
but  I  know  the  desire  of  Mr.  Chamberlain  not  only  to  have  direct  pri- 
maries, but  to  meet  conditions  here.  I  want  to  amend  by  inserting  a 
few  words  after  the  word  "desirable,"  so  it  will  read  "if  in  the  opinion 
of  the  respective  committees  it  is  deemed  desirable  and  possible  to  do 
so,  with  proper  and  sufficient  safeguards  to  protect  such  primaries  from 
participation  therein  by  electors  of  other  parties. ' ' 

Xow,  then,  sir,  the  Governor  of  our  State  will  not  call  a  special  ses- 
sion for  direct  primaries,  though  he  says  he  believes  in  them.  Are  you 
going  to  ask  us  in  Michigan  to  have  a  primary  with  no  sworn  election 
inspectors,  with  no  law  governing  it,  with  absolutely  nothing  on  earth  to 
safeguard  it? 

MR.  HOWELL:    You  do  not  have  to  do  it  unless  you  want  to. 

MR.  WOOD  :  But  I  do  not  like  your  word  ' '  desirable. ' '  The  Demo- 
crats in  Michigan  do  not  feed  out  of  anybody's  hand.  The  rank  and 
file  desire  it.  I  want  you  to  put  there  "with  proper  safeguards." 

]Mn.  HOWELL:  How  would  it  do  to  put  in  "with  proper  safeguards" 
and  eliminate  what  you  said  in  regard  to  electors  of  other  parties  par- 
ticipating? 

MR.  WOOD:  That  would  be  all  right.  I  perhaps  went  a  little  too  far 
in  my  wording. 

MR.  HOWELL:  I  will  accept  that  amendment,  then.  The  resolution 
as  amended  would  read: 

"Resolved,  that  in  the  choice  of  delegates  and  alternates  to  the 
Democratic  National  Convention  of  1912,  the  Democratic  State  or  Ter- 
ritorial Committees  may,  if  not  otherwise  directed  by  the  law  of  such 
States  or  Territories,  provide  for  the  direct  election  of  such  delegates 
or  alternates  if  in  the  opinion  of  the  respective  committees  it  is  deemed 
desirable  and  possible  to  do  so  with  proper  and  sufficient  safeguards. 
Where  such  provision  is  not  made  by  the  respective  committees  for  the 
choice  of  delegates  and  alternates,  and  where  the  State  laws  do  not 
provide  specifically  the  manner  of  such  choice,  then  the  delegates  and 
the  alternates  to  the  said  National  Convention  shall  be  chosen  in  the 
manner  that  governed  the  choice  of  delegates  from  the  respective  States 
and  Territories  to  the  last  Democratic  National  Convention." 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the  reso- 
lution reported  by  the  gentleman  from  Georgia,  as  amended. 

The  resolution,  as  amended,  was  agreed  to. 

MR.  HOWELL:  I  have  a  resolution  here  introduced  by  Senator  Owen, 
of  Oklahoma,  to  which  the  committee  has  no  objection.  It  is  in  regard 
to  the  Federation  of  Democratic  Precinct  Clubs.  The  committee  thinks 
it  might  properly  invite  the  active  co-operation  of  these  precinct  clubs, 
and  it  recommends  the  passage  of  the  resolution.  The  resolution  is  as 
follows : 

"Resolved,  that  the  Federation  of  Democratic  Precinct  Clubs,  as  a 


Al'l'EXDIX 

self-supporting  auxiliary  of  the  regular  Democratic   Party  organization, 
is  approved  by  this  Committee." 

MR.  JOHN  E.  OSBORNE,  of  Wyoming:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  should  like  to 
ask  if  this  is  the  organization  of  which  Senator  Owen  is  the  head.  T 
have  read  a  good  deal  of  their  literature,  and  I  must  confess  that  I  do 
not  know  what  they  are  trying  to  get  at.  If  we  are  going  to  stand 
behind  this  organization  and  stand  for  its  principles,  I  think  it  ought 
to  simplify  its  literature. 

MR.  JOHNSTON,  of  Texas:  I  want  to  ask  a  question  right  here,  and 
that  is  if  that  organization,  the  Precinct  Club  organization,  is  being 
run  in  the  interest  of  any  candidate  for  President  .' 

MR.  CAVEN  :    Xo  ;    it  is  not. 

MR.  TUCKER:  Mr.  Chairman,  we  have  only  ten  minutes  in  which 
to  consider  these  resolutions.  I  am  sure  that  members  of  this  Commit 
tee  are  not  familiar  with  the  organization  of  Precinct  Clubs  referred  to, 
and  we  certainly  cannot  become  familiar  with  it  in  ten  minutes.  There- 
fore, I  move  that  we  lay  the  resolution  on  the  table. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  The  question  is  on  agreeing  to  the  motion 
of  the  gentleman  from  Arkansas  that  the  resolution  be  laid  on  the  table. 
(After  having  put  the  question.)  The  Chair  is  in  doubt. 

MR.  CHAMBERLAIN:  I  think,  as  a  matter  of  courtesy,  we  ought  to 
hear  from  Senator  Owen. 

MR.  WOOD:  We  want  to  hear  from  Senator  Owen,  but  I  see  Mr. 
Mack  in  the  room,  and  I  would  ask  whether  we  are  ready  to  dispose 
of  the  other  matter. 

MR.  TALEOTT:  I  want  to  make  a  suggestion.  Is  not  this  matter 
of  the  Federation  of  Precinct  Clubs,  and  all  that,  a  part  of  the  detail  of 
the  campaign  to  be  considered  after  we  name  our  candidates? 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:    The  Chair  would  think  so. 

MR.  WOOD:    That  is  what  we  want  to  get  from  the  Senator. 

MR.  TALBGTT:  When  we  nominate  candidates  and  have  a  new  Com 
mittee,  then  we  can  take  up  such  things. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  I  will  say  for  the  benefit  of  the  gentlemen 
that  some  such  matters  were  taken  up  after  the  nomination  was  made 
four  years  ago. 

MR.  TALBOTT:    But  it  is  not  a  matter  of  detail? 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:    It  has  been  a  matter  of  detail  heretofore, 

MR.  TALBOTT:    And  ought  it  not  to  be  taken  up  afterwards? 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:    That  is  for  the  members  to  decide. 

The   Chair   recognizes   i-'entitor   Owen. 

Me.  KiLYxn.v:  Mr.  Chairman.  I  rise  to  a  parliamentary  inquiry.  1 
would  like  to  inquire  if  the  time  allowed  the  Committee  to  put  in  shape 
the  propositions  of  the  different  cities  has  expired? 

THE  PRESIDING  OKFKTR:    It  has  pretty  nearly  expired. 

MK.    KI.I.YSO.N:     1   think  it  has  more  than  expired. 


APPENDIX  463 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:     Mr.  Owen  has  the  floor. 

MR.  O\VKN  :  Mr.  Chairman,  the  organization  of  Democratic  Precinct. 
Clubs  is  a  corporation  chartered  under  the  laws  of  the  District  of 
Columbia.  It  proposes  to  have  a  precinct  club  in  every  precinct  where  it 
is  found  desirable  by  the  Denim-rats  of  the  Union.  It  is  intended  as 
an  auxiliary  of  the  regular  Democratic  Party  organization. 

MR.  HOWEI.L:  I  understood  you  to  say  that  under  no  circumstances 
would  the  organization  be  used  in  advance  of  any  national  convention 
to  promote  the  interests  of  any  candidate. 

MR.  O\VEN  :      That  is  correct. 

MR.  HOWEI.L:  And  upon  that  understanding  the  committee  reported 
favorably  upon  the  resolution. 

MR.  OWEX:  I  call  the  attention  of  the  Committee  to  this  weakness 
in  Democratic  organization.  We  will  have  our  convention  on  the 
J-'ith  of  June.  We  will  then  elect  a  new  National  Committee.  They 
will  have  an  executive  committee.  The  time  is  very,  very  short  before 
the  election — only  three  or  four  months.  In  that  short  time  it  is 
practically  impossible  to  do  the  precinct  organization  throughout  the 
Union  that  ought  to  be  done.  In  1900  we  had  38,000  precinct  repre- 
sentatives who  served  a  useful  purpose  at  that  time. 

I  believe  we  have  a  great  opportunity  to  elect  a  Democratic  Presi- 
dent in  1912,  and  I  thought  it  ought  to  be  acceptable  to  all  Democrats 
to  promote  a  precinct  club  organization  at  each  precinct  where  the 
Democrats  may  see  that  the  Democratic  vote  is  registered,  that  it  is 
gotten  out,  that  the  interests  of  the  Democracy  are  represented  in  the 
precinct,  that  the  arguments  of  the  Democracy  are  presented  there;  and 
it  was  with  a  view  to  that  that  a  number  of  us  undertook  to  make  this 
organization.  Among  them  are  Senator  Chamberlain  of  Oregon,  Senator 
.Johnson  of  Maine.  Senator  Myers  of  Montana,  Senator  Xewlands  of 
Xevada.  and  others;  the  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Representatives.  Mr. 
Clark:  William  Kandolph  Hearst,  a  former  member  of  Congress,  and 
others.  It  is  endorsed  by  10  members  of  the  Democratic  National  Com- 
mittee. It  is  endorsed  by  Governor  Joseph  Folk,  by  Mr.  Woodrow 
Wilson,  by  W.  .1.  Bryan,  and  many  others. 

MR.  HOWEI.I.:  Mr.  Weatherly  of  Alabama  has  suggested  that  one 
line  be  added  there,  and  that  is  that  the  State  organization  is  invited 
to  co-operate  in  national  campaigns  for  the  nominees  of  the  party.  I 
do  not  think  anybody  could  object  to  that. 

THE  PuKsimxc  OI-FIOER:  I  would  like  to  ask  a  question  for  infor- 
mation. In  the  previous  campaign  of  190$.  and  perhaps  1904.  but  par 
ticularly  in  the  State  of  Indiana  in  190*.  \Vl.  would  often  get  letters 
from  Democrats  in  certain  counties  stating  that  a  new  committeeman 
had  been  appointed,  and  asking  by  what  authority  a  certain  person  was 
organizing  chilis  and  raising  money;  whether  it  was  the  old  organization, 
the  old  club,  doiny  that,  or  not ;  and  it  has  occurred  to  me  that  some 
confusion  niiyht  arise  in  that  wav. 


464  APPENDIX 

MR.  OWEN:  This  organization  is  a  recent  organization,  one  with 
which  I  have  never  had  anything  to  do  before.  It  has  no  precedent,  So 
far  as  I  know,  and  no  connection  with  any  previous  organization. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  In  1900  they  had,  I  think  Mr.  Owen  said,  38,000 
precinct  representatives. 

A  COM MITTEEMAN  :     On   paper. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Yes,  on  paper.  In  our  State  we  have  by  law  a  pre- 
cinct organization  in  every  precinct  in  the  Slate.  By  law  on  the  16th  or 
liHh  day  of  April,  there  will  be  a  precinct  organization  elected  by  the 
Democrats  of  the  respective  precincts,  in  every  precinct  in  the  State  of 
Illinois. 

MR.  OWEN:     It  ought  to  be  the  rule  everywhere. 

MK.  SULLIVAN:  It  is  the  rule  there.  Now,  those  precinct  committee- 
men  are  organized  by  law  and  recognized  by  law,  and  they  elect  all  the 
delegates  to  all  the  conventions  for  the  ensuing  two  years.  Those  men 
are  being  elected  by  law. 

MR.  STONE:     What  do  you  mean  by  "by  law?" 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I  mean  that  at  the  next  coming  primaries,  on  the 
16th  or  19th  day  of  April,  the  Democratic  voters  in  every  precinct  in 
the  State  of  Illinois  will  vote  for  a  man  called  the  precinct  committee- 
man,  who  is  the  head  of  the  precinct  organization  in  that  precinct  for 
the  ensuing  two  years,  whose  duty  it  is  to  organize  that  precinct.  We 
go,  for  instance,  in  Chicago,  from  precinct  to  precinct  and  organize  a 
precinct  club  of  10,  20,  50  at  65  Democrats,  a  chairman -and  a  secretary. 
My  point  about  this  is  this:  If  this  institution  were  doing  something  to 
promote  this  through  the  State  organizations  of  the  respective  States,  i 
would  see  no  objection  to  it ;  but  to  have  some  unknown  people  from 
some  other  State  come  into  Illinois  and  start  an  independent  organiza- 
tion, is  a  different  thing.  Of  course,  after  the  nominations  are  made 
we  ought  to  be  in  favor  of  everything  that  can  be  done  to  bring  more 
and  more  people,  others  as  well  as  Democrats,  in  line  for  our  ticket;  but 
we  do  not  want  to  encourage  or  sanction  the  encouraging  of  an  opposi- 
tion organization  or  an  organization  in  opposition  to  the  Democratic 
organization  already  in  existence,  and  that  is  just  what  has  been  done 
in  my  State  by  some  of  the  gentlemen  the.  Senator  mentions.  They  have 
:it  times  in  the  past  :u-tod  against  the  Democratic  Party.  Some  of  those 
geiitleiwM  have  acted  very  decidedly  against  the  Democratic  Party.  1;: 
the  last  campaign  we  were  up  against  that  thing. 

So,  I  say,  it  does  not  make  any  difference  who  is  in  charge  there 
now.  It  does  not  make  any  difference  who  is  on  the  State  Committee. 
Like  any  other  committee,  the  members  are  elected  by  direct  vote  of  the 
people.  The  members  of  the  precim-i  are  elected  by  the  direct  vote  of 
lli"  people.  Vei  some  of  1  hose  people  ignored  ami  fought  our  National 
oruaniy.atidii,  our  State  and  our  county  and  our  precinct  organizations. 
not  for  the  I  U'niocrat  !&lt;•  Party,  but  against  the  Democratic  Party,  and  I 
think  we  ought  at  least  to  take  more  than  ten  minutes  to  decide  whether 


APPENDIX  465 

\ve  will  give  our  official  sanction  to  what  may — I  do  not  say  it  will — 
work  an  injury  to  our  party.  Some  who  may  have  been  patriot?  iu 
times  past  may  have  changed  their  bearings.  So.  let  us  take  a  little 
more  time  on  this  matter. 

MR.  COUGHLIX:  Members  of  the  Democratic  National  Committee.  I 
believe  that  the  member  of  the  Committee  from  Illinois  has  expressed 
tin-  sentiments  of  every  State  in  the  Union  whcs?  \  eople  understand  the 
di&gt;»rder  and  confusion  which  such  approval  of  this  organization  would 
bring  upon  them.  For  my  part,  I  have  no  objection  to  any  Democratic 
organization  in  the  Union  assisting  the  Democracy  in  the  conflict  which 
is  now  before  us,  but  I  object  to  any  organization,  under  whatever  name, 
rending  strangers  into  my  Commonwealth  to  take  possession  of  our  pre- 
cin-ts  and  fight  the  battles  among  people  whom  they  do  not  know.  I 
nl  ji'i-t  because  I  shall  not  surrender  the  rights  of  fhe  regular  organiza- 
tion to  any  inferior  or  subordinate  institution  to  carry  on  the  work  of 
the  Democracy  in  my  Commonwealth,  if  my  choice  can  prevent  it. 

I  have  no  doubt  that  those  who  are  behind  this  movement  are  ani- 
mated by  lawful  motives  and  patriotic  principles — principles  that  we 
are  here  to  promulgate  and  assist  by  our  work;  but  I  hore  that  there  is 
not  a  committeeman  present  in  this  Committee  who  will  assist  in  foisting 
upon  us  strangers  to  fight  our  battles  when  we  ourselves  are  eompetenr 
to  fight  our  battles  without  their  assistance. 

Mi:.  WILLIAMS  :  I  want  to  ask  the  Senator  from  Oklahoma  one  ques- 
tion, and  that  is  whether  or  not  the  clubs  which  this  incorporated  com- 
pany is  authorized  under  the  laws  of  the  District  of  Columbia  to  estab- 
lish in  each  precinct,  have  any  adjective  before  the  word  "Democratic".' 
I  am  asking  for  information.  I  have  gotten  communications  from  some 
organization  of  the  kind  (and  I  think  possibly  it  is  the  same  club)  that 
labeled  me  a  progressive  Democrat  or  labeled  me  a  conservative  Demo- 
crat. Xow.  I  am  just  a  plain,  ordinary  Mississippi  Democrat,  and  I  do 
not  believe  in  any  adjectives  going  before  the  word  "Democrat."  A 
conservative  Democrat  is  just  as  good  as  a  progressive  Democrat,  and  v 
progressive  Democrat  is  just  as  good  as  a  conservative  one,  provided  he 
is  loyal  to  the  Democratic  Party. 

So  I  want  to  ask  for  information,  whether  or  not  this  organization 
uses  any  adjective  before  the  word  "Democrat";  whether  it  is  "con- 
servative Democrat"  or  whether  it  is  "progressive  Democrat."  I  do 
not  care  which,  because  I  am  not  going  to  let  anybody  label  me.  I  label 
myself  a  Democrat,  and  I  abide  by  the  decisions  of  my  party,  and  I  do 
not  care  whether  that  decision  is  in  accordance  with  or  in  conflict  with 
my  private  opinion ;  as  long  as  the  great  principles  of  the  Democratic 
party  are  in  the  platform,  I  abide  by  it.  I  want  to  know  whether  you 
understand  my  question. 

MK.  Tn.i.MAX:  I  suggest,  in  the  interest  of  harmony,  that  the  reso- 
lution be  withdrawn. 


466  APPENDIX 

MR.  McGR.vw:  I  suggest  that  we  let  it  go  until  the  next  meeting  of- 
the  Committee  in  June. 

MR.  JOHNSON,  of  Texas:  I  move  that  the  resolution  be  referred  to 
the  new  National  Committee,  and  I  ask  the  previous  question  on  that. 

MR.  OWEN  :     I  think  I  have  the  floor. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICE'R:     Yes,  Mr.  Owen  has  the  floor. 

MR.  OWEN  :  I  am  amazed  at  the  character  of  the  opposition  to  this 
resolution.  This  organization  was  intended  for  the  welfare  of  the  party 
to  which  I  have  been  attached  all  my  life.  The  object  is  "to  take  part 
in  a  permanent,  nation-wide,  uniform  movement  for  unifying  and 
strengthening  the  Democratic  Party  and  electing  a  Democratic  President 
in  1912,  thus  ending  the  rule  of  the  predatory  interests,  and  establish- 
ing tLe  rule  of  the  people  from  the  precinct  up."  It  is  expressly  pro- 
vided iu  the  program  that  it  is  open  to  all  Democrats.  As  I  &lt;ay. 
I  was  amazed  at  the  opposition,  and  since  it  seems  to  be  raising  a 
tempest  in  a  teapot,  I  will  withdraw  the  resolution. 

MR.  HOWELL:  Mr.  Jennings  of  Florida  tfas  offered  the  following 
resolution :  • 

"Resolved,  that  three  members  be  appointed  by  the  Chair  to  con- 
sider the  question  of  the  printing  of  all  convention  proceedings  of  the 
Democratic  Party  in  suitable  and  lasting  form,  and  that  this  committee 
report  its  conclusions  to  the  Committee  on  Arrangements  for  the  coming 
National  Convention." 

This  does  not  involve  any  expense,  and  I  move  its  adoption. 

The  resolution  was  agreed  to;  and  the  Chair  appointed  as  the  com- 
mittee, Mr.  Jennings,  Mr.  Mountcastle  and  Mr.  Howell. 

MR.   HOWELL:     Here   is  a  resolution  offered  by   Mr.   Wood: 

"Re&amp;oJved,  that  the  telegraphic  press  section  at  the  National  Con- 
vention be  placed  entirely  under  control  of  the  Press  Committee  of 
Congress,  under  the  direction  of  the  sub-committee  on  arrangements  for 
the  National  Committee." 

MR.  TALBOT:  In  this  connection,  I  desire  to  say  that  the  gentleman 
in  charge  of  the  press  gallery.  Mr.  C.  H.  Mann,  is  thoroughly  equipped 
to  handle  this  matter. 

THE  PRESIDING  OFFICER:  I  suggest  that  the  resolution  should  be 
given  to  the  Committee  on  Arrangements. 

MR.  HOWELL:     It  will  go  to  them. 

Here  is  the  usual  District  of  Columbia  proposition.  It  has  been  up 
every  year  for  twenty  years: 

"Resolved,  that  the  primaries  for  the  Democratic  Party  in  the  District 
of  Columbia  be.  and  they  are  hereby,  ordered  to  be  held  under  the 
direction  of  the  Democratic  Central  Committee  of  the  District  of  Colum- 
1'i.i.  of  which  committee  J.  Fred  Kelley  is  chairman;  and  that  the 
election  of  said  delegates  be  conducted  under  the  same  rules  and 
regulations  formulated  by  the  Democratic  National  Committee  for  the 
conduct  iif  s:iid  primaries  in  1904  or  1908." 


APPENDIX  467 

MK.    KLLYSON  :     Are  there  any   of  the   usual   divisions   in  this  case? 

MR.  HCAVELL:  Yes,  just  as  usual.  There  has  not  been  a  committee 
in  twenty  years  from  the  District  of  Columbia  in  which  this  controversy 
h;  s  not  cdii  e  uj&gt;.  The  settlement  is  based  upon  the  result  of  the  McGraw 
(  ommittee,  of  four  years  ago  and  eight  years  ago. 

I  move  the  adoption  of  the  resolution. 

The  resolution  was  agreed  to,

nobody  to  guarantee  it.  The  guarantee  is  good,  and  if  you  come  to

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  The  first  order  of  business  will  be  the  report  of 
the  Sub-Committee  on  Temporary  Organization. 

Mr.  Mack  yielded  the  chair  to  Mr.  Cummings,  of  Connecticut,  and, 
taking  the  floor,  made  the  following  statement : 

Fellow  Members  of  the  National  Committee:  On  Thursday  the  20th 
instant,  before  the  Committee  on  Arrangements,  I  placed  the  name  of 
Judge  Alton  B.  Parker  in  nomination  for  the  office  of  Temporary  Chair- 
man of  the  Democratic  Convention.  I  did  that  believing  him  to  be  one 
of  the  best  Democrats  in  the  United  States;  not  only  in  our  own  State 
but  also  in  the  country  at  large,  and  I  might  lay  special  stress  on  his 
splendid  Democracy,  but  inasmuch  as  all  of  us  know  him,  and  I  think 
the  country  knows  him  very  well,  there  is  no  occasion  for  my  doing  so. 

In  1896,  when  I  was  fighting  for  the  party  in  my  State,  he  was  one 
of  the  prominent  men  in  the  State  that  I  could  look  up  to  and  call  upon 
for  assistance.  I  was  at  that  time  a  member  of  the  State  Central  Com- 
mittee of  New  York,  and  in  1897,  one  year  after,  Judge  Parker  was  a 
candidate  for  Chief  Justice  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  and  I  was  a  ram- 
pant Parker  man,  because  of  his  services  to  the  party  in  1896,  when  men 
like  Judge  Parker,  I  am  sorry  to  admit,  were  mighty  scarce  in  our  State. 


APPENDIX  477 

I  \v;is  mi  enthusiastic  supporter  of  .lud.ue  1'arkcr  because  of  his  loyalty 
to  the  party  in  that  year.  Since  that  time,  except  when  on  the  bench, 
he  has  always  been  an  active  Democrat,  as  well  as  before  he  went  on 
the  bench. 

When  Mr.  Bryan  was  nominated  in  the  last  convention,  Judge  Parker 
was  not  permitted  to  go  back  home  from  Denver.  He  spent  six  weeks 
in  the  Western  States  making  speeches  for  the  nominee  of  the  party. 
He  has  supported  the  national  ticket  loyally  all  his  life — never  made  an 
exception.  En  our  own  State  he  has  always  been  on  the  stump.  Last 
fall — and  this  is  one  of  the  things  that  endears  him  to  the  Democratic 
party  of  our  State — when  iii  the  great  City  of  New  York  there  was  a 
local  contest  and  we  needed  Democratic  votes  in  this  local  contest,  be- 
cause national  politics  did  not  cut  much  figure,  Judge  Parker  took  the 
stump  for  the  local  ticket  and  it  is  believed  saved  our  ticket  in  that 
great  contest  in  the  City  of  New  York. 

I  have  been  asked  how  it  was  I  happened  to  be  for  Judge  Parker  for 
Temporary   Chairman.     This  has   been   talked   over   more  or   less  and   T 
want   the   Committee   to    know   my   position.     I   presented   the   name   of 
Judge  Parker  because  he  is  from  my  own  State  and,  like  you  other  gen 
tlemen,  I  desire  to  pull  off  something  once  in  a  while,  if  I  can  do  so. 

Some  months  ago  it  was  rumored  generally  that  Mr.  Bryan  might  be 
a  candidate,  and  I  want  to  say  right  here  that  if  Mr.  Bryan  had  beeu 
a  candidate  I  would  have  been  for  him.  The  people  of  New 'York  knew 
I  would  be  for  him,  for  I  told  them  so,  and  they  made  no  objections 
whatever.  Not  a  man  in  our  State  objected  and  I  kept  the  place  open 
and  would  not  discuss  it  for  three  months,  trying  to  find  out  whether 
Mr.  Bryan  was  a  candidate  or  not.  If  he  had  been  a  candidate  he 
would  have  been  nominated  and  agreed  upon  the  other  day  without  any 
serious  objection.  A  month  ago  I  received  a  letter  from  Mr.  Bryan 
saying  he  was  not  a  candidate  and  suggesting  that  I  confer  with  Gov- 
ernor Wilson  and  Mr.  Champ  Clark.  I  wrote  him  saying  I  did  not  think 
that  was  practicable,  because  if  I  went  to  either  one  and  the  Committee 
should  not  approve  of  it,  probably  it  would  not  be  just  the  thing  to  do. 
I  could  not  name  the  Chairman.  I  had  to  report  to  the  Committee  and 
let  the  Committee  name  the  Chairman — this  Committee  and  the  Sub- 
Committee  name  the  Chairman.  The  difficulty  is  that  the  managers  of 
Mr.  Clark  may  favor  one  man  and  the  managers  of  Mr.  Wilson  favor 
another  and  so  on.  When  E  received  the  letter  from  Mr.  Bryan,  it  came 
to  my  mind,  Who  is  the  next  mcst  conspicuous  living  Democrat?  Judge 
Parker  occurred  to  me  because  he,  too,  had  been  a  candidate  for  the 
Presidency.  That  fact  influenced  me  more  than  anything  else.  That 
was  the  only  thought  I  had.  The  leaders  in  New  York  thought  it  would 
be  a  wise  thing  to  do. 

Here  were  two  big  places  that  ought  to  go  to  our  two  leading  men, 
one  the  Temporary  Chairmanship  and  the  other  the  chairmanship  of  the 
Committee  on  Eesolutions.  We  planned  that  way  and  I  saw  no  objec- 


478  APPENDIX 

tion  to  it  and  thought  it  was  fair  and  for  that  reason  I  presented  tht 
name  of  Judge  Parker.  I  deemed  it  to  be  good  politics.  lie  is  recog- 
nized  by  the  country  generally  as  a  conservative,  progressive  Democrat, 
lie  is  as  progressive,  in  any  speech  he  may  make,  a?  any  man  in  this 
room,  or  out  of  it.  He  was  Temporary  Chairman  of  our  convention  two 
years  ago  in  Kochester,  and  if  you  gentlemen  have  read  his  speech,  or 
know  of  it,  you  will  admit  that  it  is  progressive,  and  the  platform 
adopted  at  that  convention  was  as  progressive  as  that  of  any  State  in 
the  Union.  He  stood  for  direct  primaries,  the  election  of  United  States 
Senators  by  the  people,  parcels  post,  and  all  the  other  matters  of  that 
kind  which  have  been  recently  taken  up  as  progressive  j.arry  policies 
He  presided  over  that  convention  and  we  adopted  the  platform  and  every 
plank  in  it  has  been  put  into  effect  by  the  Governor  and  Legislature  of 
our  State. 

I  thought  it  would  be  wise  politics  for  this  Committee  to  give  this 
honor  to  what  might  be  called  the  conservative  men  in  the  party,  if  there 
be  such  a  thing.  But  Judge  Parker  certainly  is  not  considered  by  the 
people  of  New  York  to  be  a  conservative,  unless  it  be  conservative  for 
a  man  to  stand  for  the  income  tax  and  other  general  ideas  that  are 
favored  by  the  progressives.  I  therefore  saw  no  objection  to  his  nomina- 
tion for  temporary  Chairman  of  this  convention,  but,  on  the  contrary, 
considered  it^good  politics,  for  I  had  in  mind  that  possibly  the  other 
gentlemen  here  might  agree  upon  the  permanent  Chairman,  to  which  we 
would  have  no  objection,  whether  he  be  a  progressive  or  conservative  or 
what  not.  For  these  reasons  I  present  Judge  Alton  B.  Parker,  who  was 
agreed  upon  by  your  Sub-Committee,  as  Temporary  Chairman,  and  trust 
that  the  full  Committee  will  ratify  the  action  of  the  Sub-Committee  last 
Thursday  in  this  city.  [Applause.] 

(Mr.  Mack  resumes  the  Chair.) 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     Are  there  any   further   nominations? 

Mr.   Adams,  of  Colorado,  after  stating  that  he  had  the  greatest  a&lt;l-» 
miration  for  Judge   Parker,  said   that  he,  nevertheless,  was   opposed  to 
his   nomination,  representing,   as   he    (Mr.    Adams)    did.   the   progressives 
of  the  West. 

Mr.  Xewlands,  of  Nevada,  felt  constrained  to  give  utterance  to  the 
progressive  element  of  the  West  and.  at  The  same  time,  expressing  the 
highest  appreciation  for  Judge  Parker,  said  that  in  his  judgment  the 
progressive  element  of  the  Democratic  Party  should  be  honored  and 
n  cn^nix.ed  in  the  naming  of  a  Temporary  Chairman. 

Mr.  Hrowne.  of  Vermont,  stated  that  he  did  not  know  whether  he 
could  be  classed  as  a  progressive  or  a  reactionary;  that  he  was  simply 
a  Democrat  and  was  aluays  in  the  forefront  of  the  battle  for  Demo- 
cratic principles;  that  the  members  c.f  this  Committee  would  not  have 
hesitated  for  a  single  inManl  to  vote  for  The  selection  of  Judge  Parkt  r 
if  lie  had  had  the  ().  K.  of  the  other  only  living  nominee  of  the  Demo- 


APPENDIX  479 

cratic  party  for  President,  and  lie  seconded  the  nomination  of  Judge 
Parker. 

MR.  \VIU.JA.MS.  of  Mississippi:  It  is  with  a  great  deal  of  diffidence 
and  embarrassment  that  I  can  get  my  consent  to  talk  to  you  at  all, 
because,  I  suppose,  of  all  the  men  in  this  meeting  I  am  the  least  con- 
spicuous and  least  important,  but  as  a  representative  in  this  Committee 
I  will  state  that  there  is  not  a  man  in  this  Committee  who  dares  to  chal- 
lenge the  Democracy  of  my  constituency,  and  that  is  the  State  of  Mis- 
sissippi. Judge  Parker  is  a  man  of  integrity,  a  man  of  honesty,  he 
fills  every  Jefferson ian  definition  of  a  Democrat.  He  supported  the 
party  in  season  and  out  of  season;  he  supported  it  when  it  went  his  way 
and  when  it  went  the  other  way.  1  was  asked  the  other  day  whether  I 
\vas  progressive  or  reactionary  and  I  said.  "God  Almighty,  I  am  noth- 
ing but  a  Democrat,  and  you  can't  put  any  definition  on  my  democracy." 
I  appeal  to  you  to  ratify  the  action  of  your  Sub-Committee,  not  alone 
because  it  is  the  action  of  the  Sub-Committee,  but  also  because  I  think  it 
is  the  part  of  wisdom. 

.Mi;.  DAXIKLS:  "When  the  Committee  on  Arrangements  met  a  few 
days  Mgo,  ei^lit  members  of  that  Committee  voted  for  Judge  Parker. 
Kight  other  members  of  that  Committee  voted  against  Judge  Parker, 
and  therefore  the  Sub-Committee  comes  here  with  a  tie  vote  as  to 
whether  this  eminent  Xew  York  jurist  should  be  our  Temporary  Chair- 
man or  not.  Some  of  us  felt  that,  in  this  crisis  in  the  party,  we  ought  not 
to  name  any  man  for  Temporary  Chairman  whom  half  of  the  Sub-Com- 
mittee thought  ought  not  to  be  named,  and  which  a  very  large  element 
of  the  party  thought  might  be  a  mistake.  1  have  never  believed  it  was 
good  politics  or  the  part  of  wisdom  for  our  party  here  today  to  make 
as  Temporary  Chairman  any  man  whom  one-half  of  the  Committee  on 
Arrangements  and  a  great  element  of  the  party  in  the  country  objected 
to.  however  able  he  may  be  or  however  worthy  he  is.  We  have  too  many 
men  in  this  country,  gentlemen,  in  every  part  of  the  country,  who  are 
acceptable  to  the  whole  party  to  make  this  great  rift  and  trouble  in 
our  party. 

I  have  never  for  a  moment  lost  hope  that  we  would  be  wise  enough 
and  bread  enough  to  surrender  any  personal  preference  and  get  together 
before  tomorrow  upon  a  gentleman  that  we  can  all  unite  upon,  and  I 
have  that  hope  even  now. 

We  have  before  us  a  half  do/.en  important  matters  to  consider;  a 
half  dozen  contests  betVre  us.  We  could  take  these  contests  up  and 
settle  them,  letting  this  matter  be  deferred  a  couple  of  hours,  and  it  may 
be  that  we  may  find  a  place  then  where  we  can  unite.  It  is  a  situation 
that  every  Democrat  regrets.  Why  is  one  man  necessary  to  be  Tempo- 
rary Chairman  .'  We  have  fifty  men  here  who  could  act  as  Temporary 
Chairman — the  country  is  full  of  them.  Let  us  not  lose  hope,  even  now, 
that  we  may  get  together,  and  1  move  &gt;ou,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  this 
matter  of  selecting  a  Temporary  Chairman  be  deferred  until  we  have 


480  APPENDIX 

passed  upon  these  other  matters,  in  the  hope,  still,  that  we  may  find  a 
common  ground  to  stand  upon.  • 

MR.  WOOD,  of  Michigan:  We  have  delegations  coming  in  here  every 
hour.  We  are  men,  not  boys;  we  have  work  to  do  and  I  hope  we  will 
meet  this  situation  and  let  us  meet  it  as  far  as  we  can  without  much 
debate. 

MR.  JONES,  of  New  Mexico :  I  believe  there  is  no  one  who  could 
possibly  be  more  anxious  to  nominate  a  successful  ticket  at  this  con- 
vention than  I*  am.  Without  conferring  with  any  of  the  persons  who 
have  addressed  you,  I  formed  the  idea  that  something  might-  be  done  ai 
this  time  to  allay  any  friction  which  might  possibly  have  arisen.  1 
second  the  proposition  made  by  Brother  Daniels. 

MR.  HOWELL,  of  Georgia:  I  am  a  member  of  the  Sub-Committee 
and  I  am  one  of  the  eight  who  voted  to  recommend  Judge  Parker  as 
Temporary  Chairman.  It  is  but  just  to  me  and  it  is  just  to  you  that  I 
should  give  you  the  reasons  why  I  so  cast  my  vote.  I  came  here  under 
the  belief,  and  with  what  I  thought  to  be  the  assurance  at  that  time, 
that  the  name  of  William  Jennings  Bryan  would  be  presented  to  the 
Sub-Committee  on  Arrangements  for  the  position  of  Temporary  Chair- 
man. I  had  been  notified  by  Mr.  Mack  that  Mr.  Bryan  had  the  matter 
under  consideration  and  that,  at  the  time  Mr.  Mack  informally  com- 
municated with  me,  Mr.  Bryan  was  holding  in  abeyance  his  decision  on 
the  question  as  to  whether  or  not  he  would  permit  the  use  of  his  name 
•  for  the  Temporary  Chairmanship  of  this  convention.  I  came  here  fully 
prepared  to  cast  my  vote  for  Mr.  Bryan,  believing  that,  as  the  three 
time  leader  of  the  party,  he  was  eminently  fit  to  be  chosen  as  Temporary 
Chairman  of  this  Convention,  and  not  until  I  got  here  did  I  know  thai 
Mr.  Bryan  had  decided  not  to  permit  the  use  of  his  name  and  that  the 
member  of  this  Committee  from  New  York,  our  distinguished  Chairman, 
took  the  next  logical  step,  as  he  conceived  it  to  be,  and  presented  to  this 
Committee  the  name  of  the  only  other  living  nominee  of  the  party,  Alton 
B.  Parker.  I,  very  promptly  and  as  I  thought  properly,  cast  my  vote 
.  for  Judge  Parker.  Any  Democrat  can  afford  to  stand  on  the  speech 
that  Judge  Parker  made  at  the  New  York  convention.  No  man  can  put 
his  finger  on  a  single  point  that  detracts  from  the  loyalty  of  Judge 
Parker  as  a  Democrat  or  from  his  activity  as  a  progressive.  He  will 
not  preside  for  an  hour  and  there  isn't  a  contest  before  this  body,  or 
before  the-  Committee  on  Credentials,  that  will  probably  be  considered 
ten  minutes.  You  simply  have  this  man  call  the  Convention  to  order, 
announce  that  you  are  ready  for  permanent  organization,  get  down  to 
business,  nominate  your  nominee,  and  every  element  of  the  party  leases 
this  hall  ready  to  co-operate  as  an  active  working  Democrat.  Do  not  let 
us  lose  that  opportunity. 

Mu.  DAVIKS,  of  Wisconsin:  Gentlemen,  at  the  outset  permit  me  to 
say  that  I  do  not  purport  to  sj  eak  for  any  man  or  any  candidate.  1  do 
not  apprehend  that  anything  I  may  be  able  to  say  will  change  this  vote 


APPENDIX  481 

here,  but  I  would  be  recreant  to  my  obligation  to  the  people  of  Wiscon- 
sin did  I  not  suggest  to  you  some  of  the  reasons  that  appeal  to  them  in 
this  situation. 

\Vc  are  confronted,  gentlemen,  with  one  of  the  gravest  crises  in  the 
history  of  the  political  parties  of  this  country.  That  is  the  big  fact  in 
this  situation.  We  must  not  lose  our  perspective;  we  must  not  allow 
non-essentials  to  cloud  Ih's  fact.  Conditions  in  the  country  all  point  to 
one  thing;  that  the  political  thought  of  the  country  is  at  the  parting  of 
the  ways;  and  that  a  new  party  is  being  born.  We  should  see  in  thi&lt; 
situation  that  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  the  Democratic  party  to 
do  now  what  Thomas  Jefferson  did  with  the  old  Republican  party,  that 
is  divide  the  opposition  and  then  gobble  up  the  entire  Eepublican  party 
ami  assimilate  it  into  the  Democratic  party.  This  is  the  big  fact  that 
we  should  get  into  our  minds  and  do  all  in  our  power  to  effect. 

I  have  nothing  against  Mr.  Parker  as  a  lawyer,  and  as  a  gentleman 
I  regard  him  with  a  most  high  admiration.  I  regard  the  leaders  from 
New  York  as  men  of  nruch  wisdom  and  earnestness  in  their  purpose; 
but  permit  me  to  say  that  there  is  a  great  body  of  thinking,  independent 
Democrats  who  would  regard  his  nomination  here  as  an  indication  of 
Wall  Street  control,  and  these  are  men  who  place  principle  above  party 
and  citi/enship  before  fealty  to  party.  In  the  manner  in  which  this 
situation  has  developed  in  the  eyes  of  the  people,  it  has  become  an  issue 
between  certain  New  York  forces  and  the  rest  of  the  country.  Do  not 
forgot  that  the  eyes  of  the  country  are  upon  you;  that,  while  some  of 
you  have  said  that  this  is  a  non-essential,  in  the  minds  of  thousands  of 
Democrats  who  are  watching  to  see  what  you  are  going  to  do,  this  ques- 
tion is  regarded  as  vital.  May  I  suggest  to  you,  gentlemen,  that  you 
remember  that  the  judgment  of  the  whole  country  in  the  history  of  the 
Democratic  party  has  been  better  than  the  judgment  of  the  leaders  of 
New  York.  I  pray  you  to  remember,  gentlemen,  that  the  only  times 
that  the  Democratic  party  has  gone  to  success  were  when  Samuel  J. 
Tilden,  of  Xew  York,  was  elected  against  the  judgment  of  the  leaders  of 
New  York,  and  when  Grover  Cleveland  was  elected  against  the  judgment 
of  the  leaders  of  New  Y'ork.  There  is  an  opportunity  here  for  New 
York  leaders  to  show  to  the  country  that  they  place  devotion  to  party 
above  the  petty  considerations  of  personal  dignity. 

You  say  here  that  you  are  going  to  have  a  progressive  speech,  that 
Mr.  Parker's  address  is  all  that  the  most  radical  progressive  could  ask 
for,  that  the  platform  will  be  progressive.  Then  why,  now,  in  the  name 
of  reason,  do  you  start  out  by  giving  the  people,  who  are  watching  this 
convention,  the  idea  that  the  reactionary  forces  are  in  control?  If 
these  things  that  you  say  are  true,  why  allow  personal  considerations 
to  stand  in  the  way?  And  T  suggest  to  you  now,  that,  if  you  persist  in 
this  position,  the  people  will  make  up  their  minds  that  this  is  in  fact  a 
deliberate  attempt  to  control  the  party  by  reactionary  forces;  and  their 
verdict  will  be  a  powerful  rebuke. 


482  APPENDIX 

The  situation  is  pregnant  with  great  possibilities  for  a  great  Demo- 
cratic party.  I  pray  that  you  men  in  New  York  will  have  breadth,  of 
vision  enough,  strength  of  judgment  enough,  wisdom  enough,  to  see  how 
the  country  is  tending,  and  what  the  people  are  thinking.  If  you  will 
take  this  big  position  with  largeness  of  vision  and  patriotic  principles, 
you  will  not  persist  in  this  matter.  In  the  name  of  our  great  party 
and  its  history  and  traditions,  in  the  name  of  the  great  body  of  thinking, 
progressive,  independent  Democrats  of  the  Middle  West,  do  not  throttle 
this  great  hope  for  our  party,  do  not  kill  this  hope  in  the  borning.  The 
country  is  looking  now  to  the  Democratic  party.  May  it  stand  true  to 
its  traditions  and  great  principles  that  our  country  may  endure. 

MR.  KREMER,  of  Montana:  It  occurs  to  me  that  the  Middle  West, 
Southwest  and  Northwest  are  having  a  harder  time  to  determine 
what  is  the  proper  course  for  this  Committee  to  pursue  than  almost  any 
section  of  the  country.  It  occurred  to  me  .that,  in  all  of  the  arguments 
that  have  been  presented  here  by  men  from  all  sections  of  the  country, 
some  claiming  that  it  was  a  fight  between  the  reactionaries  and  pro 
gressives,  others  claiming  that  we  should  defer  and  counsel  and  advise, 
there  is  one  question  which,  to  my  mind,  is  greater  than  any  presented. 
It  was  said,  in  one  of  the  arguments  presented,  that  there  was  no  key- 
note of  Democracy.  There  is  a  keynote  of  Democracy  and  the  man  who 
sounds  that  keynote  and  declares  for  equal  justice  for  all  and  special 
privileges  for  none  has  announced  a  keynote  that  resounds  in  the  hearts 
of  everyone  of  you  if  you  are  all  true  Democrats.  I  have  to  go  back 
to  Montana  after  casting  my  vote  and  I  am  willing  to  meet  any  criti- 
cisms that  might  be  cast  upon  it.  The  innuendo  and  insinuation  I  hurl 
back  without  remark.  I  am  willing  that  the  people  of  my  State,  the 
great  progressive  State,  shall  judge  my  actions  when  I  say  it  was  an 
ordinary  vote  cast  in  an  ordinary  contest,  the  quintessence  of  which  was 
justice  for  the  man  to  whom  the  Democratic  party  owed  an  act  of 
justice,  and  that  man  is  Judge  Parker. 

Mi;.  TAGGART,  of  Indiana:  I  do  not  desire  to  stop  the  debate  on 
this  question,  but  I  am  going  to  suggest,  if  I  understand  the  position 
correctly,  the  motion  before  the  house  is  to  proceed  with  the  adoption 
of  the  recommendation  of  the  Committee  on  Arrangements  in  regard  to 
the  Temporary  Chairmanship.  Mr.  Paniels  made  a  motion  that  that  be 
postponed,  and  I  want  to  ask  the  Chairman  now,  ought  I  make  the 
motion  that  Mr.  Daniels'  motion  be  laid  on  the  table  and  that  we  pro- 
(•i'&lt;&lt;l  immediately  \\ith  the  election  of  a  Temporary  Chairman? 

THK  CHAIU.MAX:  Dr.  Hall  has  asked  to  be  heard  before  the  putting 
of  the  question  on  that  motion,  and  I  will  allow  him  the  floor.  • 

Mi;.  HALL,  of  Nebraska:  Gentlemen  of  the  National  Committee: 
These  questions  that  you  are  deciding  here  now  are  questions  that  vitally 
affect  the  life  of  the  Democratic  party.  I  believe  that  the  action  of 
this  Committee  is  the  initial  action  of  a  successful  convention  and  a  suc- 
cessful election,  or  is  the  initial  act  of  a  rout.  I  hope  that  you  will 


APPENDIX  483 

come  into  the  determination  of  this  question  \viih  a  c:i!in  judicial  tem- 
perament that  the  gravity  of  the  question  requires.  I  have  listened  to 
the  speeches  of  the  gentlemen  on  both  sides  of  this  question  and  I  realize 
that  their  sentiments  aie  expressed  a&lt;  their  honest  convictions  and  I  do 
not  challenge  the  sentiment  or  honesty  of  any  man  who  has  spoken  on 
this  floor.  I  am  known  in  my  party  and  in  m\  a  Democrat,  ami 

I  know  that  all  the  great  progress  in  this  world,  and  all  the  great  accom 
plishments,  have  1  e:'ii    liy  the  united  efforts  of  men.  am!   my  purpo.-e   in 
speaking  to  you   now   is   to   plead   with   this   Committee   to   consider    ihi.s 
matter   carefully  and   judicially. 

1  appieciute  the  viewpoint  of  the  gentleman  from  New  York.  You 
have  a  distinguished  citizen  there  that  it  decs  ail  democracy  pleasure  to 
laud,  but  tlieie  is  a  movement  in  this  country  that  is  a  psychological 
movement,  which  is  not  confined  alone  to  the  United  States,  but  it  is 
going  around  the  world.  Gentlemen,  the  people  are  gasping  for  govern- 
ment. They  are  going  io  have  more  veice  in  government  than  they  Have 
now.  It  may  lie  that  the  movement  is  wrong,  it  may  be  that  it  is  right, 
but  the  reo;  le  are  going  to  have  their  chance,  and  that  is  the  Western 
view  of  the  program  that  now  confronts  the  Democratic  party  and  that 
really  confronts  this  Committee.  I  know  not  what  the  decision  of  this 
Committee  may  be.  You  may  select  Judge  Parker  for  the  Temporary 
Chairman  of  this  Convention;  you  may  not  select  Judge  Parker  for  the 
Temporary  Chairman  of  this  Convention,  but  it  does  seem  to  me  that 
it  would  be  the  part  of  wisdom  of  the  friends  of  Judge  Parker  to 
concede  to  the  contention  of  the  people  who  believe  that  it  is  a  mistake 
to  make  him  Temporary  Chairman  of  this  Convention,  because  it  is  a 
fact  that  the  country  -at  large  believes  that'  he  will  sound  the  keynote 
of  this  Convention.  That  impression  will  go  out  to  the  country  and,  no 
matter  whether  it  is  right  or  wrong,  the  impression  will  be  that  it  is  a 
reactionary  keynote. 

Now,  gentlemen,  it  does  not  make  any  difference  what  your  action  in 
this  Committee  may  be,  as  I  say  to  you,  candidly  and  honestly — and  I 
never  have  ••xpres'-ed  words  with  greater  regret  than  the  words  I  will 
iio\v  say  to  you — that  this  fight  will  not  end  in  this  Committee.  This 
fight  will  go  on  to  the  floor  of  the  Convention,  and,  gentlemen,  you  can- 
not pi-event  it  from  going  on  to  the  floor  of  this  Convention  by  persisting 
in  the  nomination  of  Judge  Parker  for  Temporary  Chairman.  It  is, 
however,  in  your  power  to  prevent  it  from  going  on  the  floor  of  the  Con- 
vention if  you  will  concede  something  to  the  people  who  do  not  believe 
that  it  is  wise  for  Judge  Parker  to  be  Temporary  Chairman  of  this  Con- 
vention, and  I  owe  it  to  you,  and  especially  to  the  people  who  are  the 
friends  of  Judge  Parker,  to  let  you  know  that  we  do  not  propose  to  let 
this  matter  stop  here. 

Now.  ge.'tlemcn.  these  are  unkind  words  for  me  to  &lt;ay  and  I  regre: 
that  I  have  tc  say  them.  I  regret  that  necessity  forces  me  to  be  a  mes- 
senger from  the  people  who  are  opposed  to  Judge-  Parker,  but  the  pro- 


484  APPENDIX 

gram  will  be — so  that  you  will  be  prepared  for  what  is  coming  to  you — 
on  the  floor  of  the  Convention  to  select  another  man  than  Judge  Parker 
for  Temporar-y  Chairman  of  this  Convention,  to  sound  the  keynote  of 
this  great  Convention,  and,  if  that  is  not  done,  then  Mr,  Bryan  himself 
will  be  a  candidate  for  Temporary  Chairman  of  this  Convention.  He 
prefers  not  to  be,  but  if  it  becomes  a  necessity,  and  the  people  who  are 
opposed  to  Judge  Parker  cannot  agree  upon  some  other  man,  then  Mr. 
Bryan  will  be  that  candidate  himself,  and  I  make  this  statement  that 
you  may  know  when  you  cast  this  vote  just  what  is  before  you  and  that 
this  question  will  not  be  settled  in  tbis  Committee,  but  will  go  before 
the  great  Convention  that  meets  out  here  in  a  few  hours. 

Now,  gentlemen,  I  plead  with  you  to  take  a  little  time  to  think  this 
over.  It  was  only  fair  to  you  to  say  that  this  is  what  will  happen.  It 
gives  you  the  opportunity  to  know  what  will  happen  in  this  Convention. 
It  may  be  that  this  program  will  end  this  Convention  in  rout  as  if  did 
in  the  convention  in  Chicago,  but  it  is  the  inevitable  course  if  this  Com- 
mittee decides,  as  the  eight  members  in  the  Sub-Committee  did,  to  make 
Judge  Parker  the  Temporary  Chairman  of  the  Convention.  This,  gen- 
tlemen, is  the  program  for  this  Convention  and  in  casting  your  vote  I 
want  you  to  know  it. 

MR.  WALLACE,  of  Utah:  I  do  not  think  Mr.  Taggart's  motion  lias 
been  seconded. 

MR.  JENNINGS,  of  Florida:     I  seconded  it. 

MR.  TAGGART,  of  Indiana:  I  will  withdraw  the  motion  to  give  a 
member  of  the  Committee  an  opportunity  to  speak. 

MR.  MILLER,  of  Oregon:  As  I  understand,  there  were  c'ight  votes 
for  Judge  Parker  and  eight  votes  against  him  in  the  Sub-Committee. 

Mi;.  WOOD,  of  Michigan :     Eight  scattered  votes  against  him. 

MR.  HOWELL,  of  Georgia:  I  ask  that  unanimous  consent  be  given 
for  a  motion  to  take  a  recess  for  fifteen  minutes,  and  at  the  expiration 
of  the  recess  the- previous  question  be  put  to  the  reassembled  members 
in  order  that  we  may  wind  up  this  matter  without  further  delay. 

(By  unanimous  consent  the  Committee  took  a  recess  for  fifteen 
minutes.) 

AFTER  EECESS. 

Mi;.  JONES,  of  Xe\v  Mexico:  I  move  to  amend  the  motion  hereto- 
fore made  by  Mr.  Daniels,  by  adding  thereto,  ' '  And  that  a  Committee 
consisting  of  the  Chainnan  of  this  Committee  and  Dr.  Hall  be  appointed 
',o  use  their  best  endeavors  to  bring  about  an  amicable  adjustment  of 
the  question  of  the  Temporary  Chairmanship." 

MR.  DANIELS,  of  North  Carolina:     What  is  the  question? 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  By  unanimous  consent  of  the  Committee,  it  was 
agreed  that  the  previous  question  be  ordered  on  the  pending  motion, 
which  cuts  off  further  debate.  The  vote  will  be  taken  on  the  motion 
of  Mr.  Daniels  to  defer  the  selection  ot'  Temporary  Chairman.  Mr, 
Jones'  amendment  will  be  put  to  a  vote  first. 


APPENDIX  485 

.Mi;.  Wooi..  ul  Michigan:  I  think  this  is  all  a  tempest  in  a  teapot. 
[  ha\e  profound  respect  for  these  eminent  gentlemen  who  have  been 
expressing  their  views.  1  know  they  are  honest  in  all  they  say,  but  we 
are  here  charged  \\ith  certain  work  in  connection  with  the  National  Con- 
vention. I  do  not  think  a  little  scrap  here  would  hurt  us  a  particle.  It 
is  like  a  fight  on  the  roof  between  cats — the  more  fights  the  more  kittens. 
Let  us  thrash  this  matter  out  and  reach  a  decision  one  way  or  the  other. 
Mi:.  TAGGAKT,  oi'  .Indiana:  I  feel  we  are  all  here  for  the  purpose  of 
unity  and  we  all  know  we  viill  have  pr.igiesshe  candidates  and  a  pro- 
gressive platform.  Therefore,  1  do  not  think  that  our  work  will  be  seri- 
ously interfered  with  if  we  de\ote  two  hours  to  bringing  about  a  solu- 
tion of  the  prolilem  that  confronts  us. 

MR.  BROWXJ..  of  Vermont:  I  was  one  of  the  eight  who  voted  for  the 
selection  of  Judge  Parker  as  our  Temporary  Chairman.  I  told  you 
gentlemen,  honestly  and  sincerely,  this  morning  what  I  thought  was 
right.  I  have  no  pet  candidate.  I  believe  that  if  there  is  anything 
which  can  be  done  to  relieve  the  mind  of  any  man  on  the  question  of 
Democratic  success  it  is  the  duty  of  this  Committee  to  take  it  into  con- 
sideration and  I  am  in  favor  of  the  appointment  of  the  Committee  that 
has  been  suggested,  and  whatever  they  do  I  am  sure  will  meet  the 
approval  of  the  full  Committee  and  Convention. 

Mi;.  CoutiHLix.  of  -Massachusetts:  The  State  of  Massachusetts,  which 
I  represent,  is  a  State  that  has  been  won  over  by  certain  principles,  and 
there  is  no  principle  for  which  my  State  stands  more  strongly  in  evi- 
dence than  the  principle  that  wisdom  flows  from  the  communing  of 
various  minds.  Let  these  gentlemen  whom  we  have  named  act  and 
report  back  to  us  and  then  let  us  take  a  decisive  stand  on  the  question 
and  vote  for  the  man  who  best  represents  the  ideals  of  the  democracy  of 
the  country,  and  who  will  bring  about  harmony. 

MR.  TAGGART,  of  Indiana:  1  make  another  motion  to  the  effect  that, 
if  the  motion  before  the  Committee  should  carry,  when  we  adjourn  we 
adjourn  to  meet  again  at  seven  o'clock  tonight  to  hear  the  report  of  the 
( 'c'liimittrr,  coii-Nting  of  Ihe  Chairman  and  Dr.  Hall.  They  are  to 
wait  upon  Judge  Parker  and  Mr.  Bryan,  in  the  interest  of  settling  the 
matter  of  Temporary  chairman,  and  they  ought  to  have  no  trouble  in 
coming  to  some  decision  by  seven  o'clock  this  evening. 

Mu.  JlowELi.,  of  Georgia:  We  accept  the  proposition  that  has  been 
advanced  to  have  the  Committee  appointed  to  confer  with  Mr.  Bryan  ami 
Mr.  Parker,  and  I  now  second  the  motion,  coupled  with  the  proposition 
that  we  adjourn  to  meet  again  at  seven  o'clock  tonight. 

Mi:.  AHAMS,  of  Colorado:  I  think  the  balance  of  us  should  remain 
here  and  do  our  work. 

Mu.  IlowKi.i..  of  Georgia:  There  is  not  a  member  of  this  Committee 
whose  doors  are  not  thronged  right  now  with  a  howli.ng  set  of  dervishes 
pleading  for  tickets.  There  are  fifty  waiting  at  my  door  now,  and  yet 


486  APPENDIX 

we  have  to  settle  these  other  matters,  which  will  take  until  seven  o'clock 
at  least. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :      The  question  before  the  meeting  is  that  tht 
mittee  of  two,  consisting  of  the  Chairman  and  the  Vice-Chairman  of  the 
National  Committee  confer  with  Judge  Parker   and   Mr.   Bryan   with   a 
view  to   agreeing  upon,  straightening  out   and  fixing  up   the   matter   of 
temporary  organization. 

The  motion  was  carried  unanimously. 

(The  Committee  at  this  point  took  a  recess   until   7   o'clock.) 

XIGHT  SESSION. 

After  the  call  of  the  roll  the  Chairman  announced  that  the  first 
order  of  business  would  be  the  report  of  the  Sub  Committee  appointed 
with  a  view  to  arriving  at  some  conclusion  with  respect  to  the  temporary 
organization  of  the  Convention. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Mr.  Hall  and  myself  called  on  Judge  Parker  and 
on  Mr.  Bryan.  They  consented  to  meet  each  other  very  cheerfully  and 
gladly.  We  concluded  that  we  could  accomplish  more  by  allowing  them 
to  talk  it  over  alone  and  they  had  a  very  satisfactory  social  conference, 
from  what  we  learned  afterward.  Dr.  Hall  saw  Mr.  Bryan  afterward 
and  I  saw  Judge  Parker  afterward.  The  net  result  was  t£is:  There 
was  nothing  doing,  nothing  doing;  no  nearer  to  an  understanding  or 
agreement  than  we  were  this  morning.  Dr.  Hall  may  have  something 
to  say  with  respect  to  Mr.  Bryan  and  he  will  talk  for  him. 

MR.  HALL:  I  have  simply  to  verify  what  the  Chairman  has  said.  T 
took  the  matter  up  with  Mr.  Bryan  after  the  conference  between  him- 
self and  Judge  Parker,  and  he  made  the  statement  that  neither  he  nor 
Mr.  Parker  felt  that  they  could  recede  from  the  position  they  had 
taken;  that  it  was  not  a  personal  question,  but  a  question  that  involved 
more  than  a  personal  matter  and  they  had  left  the  matter  in  the  h;;m"s 
of  this  Committee  just  as  it  was  before. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  The  previous  question  is  in  force.  I  speak  for 
•fudge  Parker  and  he  will  abide  by  any  action  taken  by  this  Committee 
beyond  any  question  of  doubt. 

MR.  ELLISON,  of  Virginia:  Mr.  Hall,  will  the  gentleman  with  whom 
you  were  in  conference  abide  by  our  decision? 

MR.  HALL:   No. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Are  there  any  further  nomination^' 
MR.  KWING.  of  Missouri:  When  I  came  here  Wednesday  to  attend  the 
meeting  of  the  Committee  on  Arrangements  I  had  no  candidate  at  all 
for  the  position  of  Temporary  Chairman.  I  was  willing  to  vote  for  ai;y 
man  satisfactory  to  the  majority  or  to  the  various  candidates  without 
seeking  any  partisan  advantage  for  one  or  the  other.  I  was  very 
much  suvprif-t'd  and  regretted  to  learn  the  situation  that  was  rapidly 
developing  here  last  Wednesday  and  along  with  others  of  the  Committee 


APPENDIX  487 

did  my  small  share  to  try  to  iron  out  the  wrinkles  that  had  out  to  the 
surface.  The  result  was,  that  when  the  Committee  met  we  \\ere  still 
divided.  I  would  like  to  present  the  name  here  of  Ollie  James  for  tiie 
position  of  Temporary  Chairman  and  I  so  nominate  him. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    Any  further  nominations' 

MR.  TALBOTT,  of  Maryland:  I  have  never  seen  a  Convention  carried, 
or  an  election,  without  the  necessary  votes,  and  I  move  that  we  proceed 
with  the  vote. 

MR.  DA  VIES,  of  Wisconsin:  If  there  are  no  further  nominations  I 
move  that  the'  nominations  be  close'd  and  that  we  proceed  to  ballot. 

MR.  XEAVLAXDS,  of  Nevada:  I  understand  from  the  press  that  Mr. 
James  has  declined  to  be  a  candidate  for  the  Temporary  Chairmanship. 
I  don't  know  whether  that  is  so  or  not.  The  objection  to  Mr.  James 
seems  to  be  overcome  by  the  communication  from  Mr.  Woodrow  Wilson  V 
supporters  that  they  are  willing  to  support  Mr.  James,  and  if  that  is  so, 
we  have  the  expression  of  pretty  nearly  two-thirds  of  this  Convention  in 
favor  of  Mr.  James. 

Mu.  JOHNSTON,  of  Texas:  I  understand  that  Mr.  James  says  he  is 
not  a  candidate. 

Mil.  E\VING,  of  Louisiana:   He  said  he  will  accept  if  you   elect  him. 

The  roll-call: 

Alabama — Parker. 

Arizona — Parker. 

Arkansas — Parker. 

California — 

MR.  YOUNG,  of  California:  I  desire  to  cast  the  vote  for  Parker  with 
a  reservation  to  vote  for  any  other  candidate  in  the  Convention  to- 
morrow. 

Colorado — James. 

Connecticut — Parker. 

Delaware — James. 

Florida — Parker. 

Georgia — Parker.

MR.  WADE:  I  am  informed  that  the  Kentucky  delegation  has  held  a 
caucus  and  by  almost  unanimous  vote  decided  to  adhere  to  the  findings  of 
this  Committee,  and,  Mr.  James  not  being  a  candidate,  I  will  vote  for 
Mr.  Parker. 

Kansas — James. 

Kentucky — 

MR.  WOODSON.  of  Kentucky:  I  wish  to  explain  my  vote.  I  wish  to 
confirm  what  Judge  Wade  has  just  said,  that  the  Kentucky  delegation  has 
acted  as  Judge  Wade  lias  indicated  and  within  the  last  half  hour  I  left 


488  APPENDIX 

Mr.  James.  He  said  to  me,  "You  do  not  intend  to  have  me  voted  for 
again  for  Temporary  Chairman,  do  you?"  And  I  said,  "Not  if  you 
don't  want  it."  He  then  demanded  of  me  that  his  name  be  not  used 
again  in  this  connection.  I  have  done  every  earthly  thing  I  could  for 
Mr.  James,  having  presented  his  name  before  the  Sub-Committee  and  en- 
deavored to  have  him  selected,  but  in  view  of  what  he  has  just  said  to 
me,  I  cannot  vote  for  him  longer.  On  account  of  this  conference  with 
Mr.  James  I  was  late  arriving.  I  didn't  know  until  a  moment  ago 
his  name  had  been  presented  to  this  Committee  for  Temporary  Chairman. 
It  was  not  by  his  authority.  In  view  of  what  he  has  just  said  to  me  J 
vote  for  Judge  Parker. 

Louisiana — James. 

Maine — Parker. 

Maryland, — Parker. 

Massachusetts — 

MR.  COUGHLIN,  of  Massachusetts:  I  would  like  to  explain  my  vote. 
My  delegation  is  split  between  Judge  Parker  and  one  who  may  be  more 
progressive.  I  shall  therefore  vote  for  Mr.  O  'Gorman. 

Michigan — Parker. 

Minnesota — James. 

Mississippi — 'Parker. 

Missouri —  . 

Montana — Parker. 

Nebraska — James. 

Nevada — James. 

New  Hampshire — Parker. 

New  Mexico — James. 

New  Jersey — 

.Mi:.  HUDSPETH,  of  New  Jersey:  I  desire  to  explain  my  vote.  When 
the  nomination  of  Mr.  James  was  under  consideration  I  nominated  Mr. 
Kern,  of  Indiana.  I  did  that  because  I  thought  he  was  in  his  person  an,J 
in  his  record  a  man  whom  the  progressives  of  this  country  have  the 
most  unbounded  confidence  in.  Now,  I  want  on  behalf  of  those  who 
feel  like  I  do,  and  who  are  favorable  to  Governor  Wilson's  candidacy, 
to  read  this  statement  which  has  been  prepared  with  deliberation  and 
speaks  for  itself: 

As  a  member  of  the  Committee  from  New  Jersey,  and  speaking  for 
the  Wilson  men,  I  desire  to  explain  my  vote. 

After  a  conference  of  the  Wilson  men,  it  was  decided  that  no  candi- 
date for  Temporary  Chairman  would  be  presented  in  the  interest  of 
Governor  Wilson.  This  is  merely  the  maintenance  of  a  decision  which  was 
arrived  at  long  before  the  question  of  the  Temporary  Chairmanship 
came  up. 

There  is  apparently  a  clear  majority  of  progressives  in  this  Com- 
mittee who  are  committed  to  the  candidacy  of  either  Speaker  Clark 
or  Governor  Wilson.  If  they  stand  united  the  people's  cause  is  won 


APPKNIHX  489 

and    the    progressives    control    the    trni|ior:iry    organi/.at  ion  ;     if     \\  e    arfl 
divided   the  progressive  c.-uis:-    f:iils. 

We  1  herefoie  cast  our  support  with  Mr.  Ollie  .lames,  of  Kentucky, 
even  though  he  lie  the  announced  Clark  candidate. 

We  do  this  that  the  cause  of  1  he  people  and  Progressive  Democracy 
shall  not  fail,  &lt;r,  if  it  fail,  the  responsibility  will  be  upon  others  and 
not  upon  us.  I  vote  for  Mr.  James. 

Mi;.  Woonsox.  of  Kentucky:  I  wish  to  call  attention  to  the  fact 
thai  Mr.  .lames  \\as  put  in  nomination  by  Mr.  Kwing,  who  is  for  Wilson 
and  not  for  Clark.  Mr.  James  is  not  a  candidate  and  is  being  voted  for 
here  without  his  knowledge  or  consent. 

.\  i  &gt;  \\    York — Parker. 

North   Carolina — ,1  ames. 

North    Dakota — James. 

Ohio — James. 

Oklahoma- 
Mi;.  Iii-:.\DY.  of  Oklahoma:  I  understand  lhat  Mr.  James  come*  from 
the  same  town  that  my  sainted  mother  came  from,  but  is  not  a  real  can- 
didate for  Temporary  Chairman,  and  having  been  able  to  seciue  that 
information,  as  I  have  only  been  in  the  city  twenty  minutes,  for  that 
reason  I  stand  by  Hie  action  of  the  Committee  and  vote  for  Mr. 
Parker,  a  gentleman  I  have  never  seen. 

Oregon — James. 

Pennsylvania — Parker. 

Rhode  Island — Parker. 

South    Carolina — James. 

South  Dakota — James. 

Tennessee — 

Mi:.  Mor.vrrASTLE:  I  desire  to  cast  my  vote  with  a  brief  explanatior 
as  follows,  I  am  a  warm  personal  and  political  friend  of  Mr.  Bryan.  If 
he  himself  were  a  candidate  before  this  Committee  under  ordinary  con 
ditions  I  would  take  pleasure  in  voting  for  him  for  Temporary  Chairman. 
1  am  also  an  adherent  of  Governor  Wilson  and  because  of  the  manner  in 
which  this  matter  is  presented,  and  believing  that.  .Midge  Parker  is  an 
able  and  true  Democrat,  and  that  turning  his  name  down  at  this 
stage  would  be  an  unwarranted  reflection  upon  him  and  his  democracy, 
and  upon  those  who  feel  as  lie  does,  I  cast  my  vote  for  Mr.  Parker. 

Texas — Parker.

Now  York.  I  stood  for  Jiulge  0 'Gorman  then,  like  Horatio  on  the

Missouri — 

MR.  GOLTRA.  of  Missouri:  I  was  absent,  Mr.  Chairman,  when  Mis- 
souri's name  was  called.  Judge  Parker  is  undoubtedly  one  of  our  great 
est  Democrats.  Ollie  James  is  one  of  our  most  able  Democrats.  I 
haven't  had  time  to  consult  with  the  delegates  from  Mi&gt;souri,  but  I 
understand  Mr.  James  was  put  forward  as  a  Clark  man.  and  we,  from 
Missouri,  are  for  Clark. 

MR.  W GODSON,  of  Kentucky:  He  has  not  been  put  forward  as  a 
Clark  man,  but  was  put  forward  without  his  knowledge,  permission  or 
consent  by  a  Wilson  man  from  Louisiana. 

MR.  GOLTRA,  of  Missouri:  I  was  simply  stating  what  I  understood  and, 
as  long  as  his  name  has  been  put  here  in  nomination,  I  feel  it  is  my  duty 
to  vote  for  Mr.  James. 

THE  CLERK:  Twenty  for  James,  thirty  one  for  Parker,  two  for 
0  'Gorman. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  Mr.  Parker  having  received  the  votes  of  a  majority 
of  this  Committee,  he  is  duly  declared  the  nominee  of  the  National  Com- 
mittee to  be  presented  to  the  Convention  tomorrow.  The  next  order  of 
business  is  nominating  a  Temporary  Secretary  of  the  Convention. 

Mi:.  JOHNSTON,  of  Texate:  I  move  that  we  present  the  name  of  the 
Honorable  Urey  Woodson  for  Temporary  Secretary. 

The   motion   carried   unanimously. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  next  order  of  business  will  be  the  naming 
of  the  Sergeant  at  Arms. 

Mi;.  JOHNSTON,  of  Texas:  I  move  that  Colonel  John  I.  Martin,  of 
M  -souri,  be  named  as  Sergeant  at  Arms  of  the  Convention. 

The  motion  was  agreed  to. 

THE  CLERK:  The  next  order  of  business  will  be  contests.  The  Sec- 
retary 's  office  shows  that  every  State  and  Territory  has  filed  proper 
credentials  and  that  there  are  contests  from  the  State  of  Illinois,  State 
of  Pennsylvania,  State  of  Rhode  Island,  State  of  South  Dakota,  State 
of  Texas,  Territory  of  Alaska,  District  of  Columbia,  Territory  of  Porto 
Rico  and  Territory  of  the  Philippines.  A  protest  was  filed  from  Ver- 
mont but  withdrawn. 

Mi:.  .JK.\MN&lt;;S,  of  Florida:  I  move  that  the  Sub-Committees  consist- 
ing of  three  be  appointed  to  hear  each  contest.

KXECUTIVE  SESSION. 

Tin;  CHAIUMAN:  The  first  order  of  business  is  that  of  selection  of 
Cliairnmn  of  this  Committee.  Nominations  for  Chairman  are  in  order. 

.Mi:.  UrnsiM'iTH :  Mr.  Chairman  and  Fellow  Members  of  this  Com- 
mittee: Regarding  the  question  of  a  National  Chairman,  I  want  to 


494  APPKXDIX 

say  that  I  have  the  fortune  to  be  the  member  of  this  Committee  from 
the  State  of  New  Jersey,  the  home  of  the  nominee  of  our  Party  for  tht&gt; 
Presidency.  T  know,  and  am  sure,  by  reason  of  my  association,  I  carry 
the  standard  of  the  Democracy  for  that  State,  and  it  is  fitting  and 
proper,  in  view  of  the  suggestions  made  by  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  on 
behalf  of  this  Committee,  to  Governor  Wilson,  at  the  time  the  mem- 
bers of  this  Committee  met  at  Seagirt,  that  they  would  like  to  hear 
from  him  in  connection  with  the  chairmanship, — which  was  according 
TO  memorial  custom  and  precedent.  Governor  Wilson  very  gladly  ac- 
cepted the  suggestion,  and  lias  given  deep  thought  to  this  matter. 
What  we  desire  to  accomplish — and  when  I  say  we,  I  s;  eak  now  of  all 
the  members  j. resent  here — is  victory, — victory  based  upon  absolute 
harmony  amc*igst  all  the  members  of  this  Committee.  And  I  feel  that 
when  I  suggest  a  name  for  the  National  Chairmanship,  that  each  and 
all  of  the  members  here  will  be  in  hearty  accord  with  that  suggestion. 

Now,  the  name  I  am  about  to  present,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  you 
all  know  of.  The  man  had  close  connection  with  the  preliminary  cam 
pa:gn.  For  the  last  year  and  a  half'he  has  given  undivided  attention 
and  faithful  work  in  connection  with  that  campaign.  He  has  shown 
wide  knowledge  of  public  men  and  public  affairs.  He  has  great 
sagacity;  and  he  has,  above  all,  the  faithful  and  loyal  progressive 
sentiment  tliat  animates  the  country  at  this  time. 

I  take  great  pleasure,  as  the  member  from  New  Jersey,  to  offer 
the  name  of  Mr.  William  F.  McCombs,  as  National  Chairman,  and  I 
iioin inate  that  gentleman  for  that  office. 

Mi:.  TAGGART:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  second  the  nomination  of  Mr. 
McCombs.  and  I  move  that  it  be  made  unanimous  by  this  Committee. 

THE    CHAIRMAN:      Are    there    any    further    nominations? 

MR.  \YADK.:  Mr  Chairman,  I  think  it  might  be  well  for  me  to  add 
a  word  to  what  Judge  Hudspeth  has  already  said  here.  To  those  of  us 
who  have  been  in  the  heat  of  many  political  battles,  we  realize  what 
it  means  to  organize  this  Committee.  We  realize  the  great  responsibility 
of  this  moment.  It  is  one  of  grave  responsibilities,  and  means  much 
to  Democracy  and  to  the  country.  We  have  had  in  the  past,  since  my 
connection  with  politics,  some  of  the  ablest  men  of  this  country  at  the 
head  of  the  National  Committee;  and  as  we  now  take  up  a  new  fight 
and  a  new  leadership,  we  cannot  but  help  feel  that  he  has  set  before 
him  a  splendid  example  of  loyalty,  courage,  determination  and  work  by 
the  last  Chairman,  and  the  Chairman  who  preceded  him,  and  the  Chair- 
man before  him.  [Applause.] 

\\'e  are  at  a  time  when  Republicans  are  declaring  their  intention  of 
supporting  the  Democratic  nominee.  But,  I  want  to  say  to  these  men 
hero  to  day.  that  \\e  cannot  go  into  this  campaign  upon  any  such 
promises  nor  any  such  outlook.  We  have  got  to  go  into  this  campaign 
Miiincd  to  make  this  a  great  Democratic  victory,  because  we  know 
how  uncertain  are  the  promises  that  come  to  use  at  this  stage  of  a 


APPENDIX  495 

political  campaign.  And,  therefore,  it  is  essential  that  we  should 
organize.  Get  behind  the  leaders  that  are  chosen,  and  then  work  with 
this  same  determination,  just  as  if  there  was  not  a  Republican  in  the 
United  States  who  had  expressed  his  preference  for  our  candidate. 

Therefore,  I  take  great  pleasure  in  seconding  the  nomination  of 
.Mr.  McCombs,  whose  experience  and  loyalty  to  the  candidate  and  to  the 
cause  has  been  fully  demonstrated. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  It  has  been  moved  and  seconded  that  the  election 
of  Mr.  McCombs  be  made  unanimous  by  this  Committee.  All  those  in 
favor  of  that  motion  will  manifest  it  by  saying  aye. 

The  motion  was  unanimously  agreed  to. 

MR.  McGRAw :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  a  Committee  of  Three 
be  appointed  to  escort  Mr.  McCombs  to  the  Chair. 

The  motion  was  duly  seconded  and  agreed  to. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  I  will  appoint  Mr.  McGraw  of  West  Virginia,  Mr. 
Taggart  of  Indiana,  and  Mr.  Daniels  of  North  Carolina,  to  escort  the 
new  Chairman  into  the  room. 

MR.  TALEOTT:  I  move  that  the  Chairman  say  something  while  they 
are  bringing  the  new  one  down  here. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  One  thing  I  want  to  say,  I  want  to  thank  the 
old  members  of  this  Committee,  as  well  as  the  new  members  whom  I 
have  had  occasion  to  meet  once  or  twice,  for  their  uniform  courtesy 
and  kindness  to  me  during  my  term  as  Chairman  of  this  Committee. 
I  don 't  think  any  Chairman,  or  any  man  ever  had  a  more  loyal  lot 
of  men  back  of  him  than  I  have.  They  h&lt;»ve  put  up  with  all  of  my 
shortcomings,  and  I  know  I  have  many  of  them.  They  have  stood  by 
me,  and  advised  me.  always  with  courtesy  and  with  a  desire  to  help  me, 
and  did  nothing  to  drag  me  down.  I  always  found  them  willing  to 
put  up  with  many  things  that  a  Chairman  has  to  contend  ^th,  and  they 
were  always  in  sympathy  with  me. 

I  can  add  this  also:  that  four  years  ago  things  did  not  look  quite 
as  bright  for  the  Democratic  Party  as  they  do  today;  but  in  talking 
the  other  night  for  a  little  while  with  the  candidate  of  our  Party, 
the  great  Governor  of  New  Jersey,  I  found  him  full  of  common  sense. 
He  \\, -isn't  carried  away  with  the  talk  that  we  have  apparently  nothing 
in  do  except  to  sit  down  and  the  next  President  will  be  a  Democrat. 
He  didn't  talk  that  way.  He  talks  very  sensibly.  He  goes  on  the 
theory — and  I  agree  with  him — that  lots  of  things  may  happen  within 
the  next  few  months,  and  for  this  reason  that  this  organization  which 
starts  in  anew  today  should  bear  in  mind  that  it  has  a  lot  of  work 
before  it,  and  should  leave  nothing  undone. 

In  my  State,  we  are  going  to  work  as  though  we  had  the  greatest 
battle  of  our  lives  before  us,  with  a  view  to  winning.  We  are  going  to 
leave  nothing  undone,  and  I  don't  believe  that  we  should  take  it  for 
granted  that  we  have  got  a  walk-over,  although  I  think  each  one  of  us 
at  heatt  feels  that  that  is  true ;  at  least  the  Republicans  tell  us  so, 


496  APPENDIX 

:unl  that  is  very  good  evidence.  At  the  same  time,  do  not  let  us  be 
fooled  by  any  sure-thing  talk.  Let  us  go  on  the  theory  that  we  have 
trot  to  fight  in  every  State,  in  every  doubtful  State,  and  every  other 
State  that  seems  now  possible  for  us  to  carry. 

Mr.  Talbott,  I  think  I  have  said  all  that  I  care  to  say  at  this 
particular  time,  and  I  thank  you  gentlemen,  for  the  courtesy  of  listening 
to  me.  [Applause.] 

MR.  SAULSBTJRY:  I  move  that  the  thanks  of  this  Committee  be 
extended  to  the  retiring  Chairman  for  the  able,  courteous,  and  loyal 
way  in  which  he  has  performed  all  ofv  the  duties  during  the  time  he 
has  been  Chairman  of  this  Committee. 

Ml!.  DANIELS:  I  second  the  motion. 

Mu.  SAULSBURY:  Gentlemen,  I  move  the  adoption  of  the  unit  inn  I 
h;i\(&gt;  just  made,  and  I  call  for  a  rising  vote. 

MR.  HUDSPETH:  Mr.  Chairman,  before  that  is  done,  I  want  to 
second  the  motion,  and  if  you  will  permit  me  to,  I  want  to  pay  my 
humble  tribute  to  the  retiring  Chairman. 

I  don't  suppose,  outside  of  a  half  dozen  members  of  the  Committee — 
although  a  junior  member  of  this  august  body — that  any  man  was  much 
closer  than  I  was  to  him  during  the  campaign  of  1908.  And,  I  want 
to  say  with  all  the  sincerity  that  within  me  lies,  that  we  never  had  u 
better  National  Committeeman  than  the  retiring  Chairman.  He  has 
worked  faithfully,  and  his  every  effort  true  to  the  cause;  resourceful. 
and  a  man  to  follow,  with  great  hope  and  buoyancy.  Now,  I  know 
what  Mr.  Mack  has  gone  through,  and  I  feel  sure  that  when  we  pass  this 
resolution  that  it  is  not  perfunctorily  passed.  It  is  an  emanation  from 
the  heart  and  brain  of  us  all,  and  I  want  to  conclude  what  I  have 
to  say  by  saying  that  I  trust  we  are  not  saying  good-bye  to  you,  Mr 
M.-ick,  but  simply  au  revoir.  [Applause.] 

The  motion  was  unanimously  adopted  by  a  rising  vote. 

Mi:.   SAULSBURY:    Mr.   Chairman,   it  is   carried   unanimously. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Gentlemen,  I  want  to  lhank  you.  I  was  goin^  \&lt;&gt; 
add  a  while  ago,  although  I  know  that  you  will  all  think  it  is  unneces- 
sary—I hope  so  at  least — that  the  new  Chairman  will  have  my  most 
cordial  support  and  assistance  in  every  way  from  now  on  until  we  name 
the  next  President,  who  I  am  sure  will  be  a  Democrat.  There  is  nothing 
that  I  will  leave  undone  to  help  him  along  in  his  work  for  the  next 
four  months,  and  it  uill  be  a  great  source  of  pleasure  for  me  to  do  it. 
[Applause.] 

Mu.  LYNCH:  I  am  going  to  supplement  the  motion  of  Mr,  Saulsbury. 
nnd  suggest  that  a  Committee  of  Mr.  Wade,  Mr.  Saulsbury  and  Mr. 
Osbornc  be  selected  to  prepare  and  to  have  fittingly  engrossed  the 
resolution  of  this  committee  which  we  feel  is  owing  to  Mr.  Mack,  arid 
have  it  extended  to  him  on  behalf  of  the  Committee,, 

The  motion  was  duly  seconded, 


APPENDIX  497 

Mu.  LYNCH:  You  have  heard  the  motion.  AH  in  favor  of  that 
mot  ion,  signify  by  saying  aye. 

MR.  LYNCH:     The  motion  is  carried. 

TIIK  CHAIRMAN:  If  yon  are  all  concluded,  I  want  to  say  that  Senator 
Gore  is  present  here.  I  know  that  he  would  be  glad  to  do  a  little 
work,  as  he  has  been  away  from  tin1  Senate  for  some  time.  [Applause.] 

SKNATOR  GORE:  1  don't  know  what  I  have  ever  done  to  the  retiring 
Chairman  to  call  this  down  on  my  bead. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  You  spent  a  day  with  me  at  Buffalo,  Senator 

SKNATOR  GORE:  I  remember  it  very  cordially,  and  very  kindly,  and 
I  wish  to  second  what  the  retiring  Chairman  iias  said,  and  I  wish  to 
second  what  Judge  Wade  has  said.  It  is  true,  the  Democratic  party 
enters  this  contest  united,  and  I  believe  unanimously  that  our  tick.'t  is 
a  tower  of  strength.  The  Republican  party  enters  this  contest  over 
whelmed  with  confusion;  that  to  them  is  a  magazine  of  destruction. 
And  yet,  gentlemen,  T  have  seen  the  Republicans  win  too  many  tights 
during  the  last  three  weeks  of  a  campaign  to  take  anything  for  granted 
in  this  contest.  We  must  wage  a  vigorous  and  an  unremitting  campaign 
until  the  battle  is  done  and  until  the  victory  is  won,  never  ceasing 
day  or  night  until  every  devout  wish  is  a  reality. 

I  have  never  seen  a  Democratic  majority  too  big  to  suit  me,  an-! 
I  shall  not  be  the  one  to  say  that  the  one  we  shall  roll  up  this  fall  will 
be  too  big.  Let  us  carry  on  this  contest  like  we  lacked  a  million  votes 
to  \\in  and  didn't  know  where  a  Dingle  vote  was  coming  from.  If 
takes  three  things  and  we  will  have  success  in  the  campaign — it  takes 
three  things  to  conduct  a  campaign:  Hope  of  success  campaign  funds 
and  successful  management.  In  the  past  \\e  have  not  had  very  much 
hope,  and  we  have  had  very  little  of  campaign  funds.  Let  us  organize 
this  country  this  year  so  that. every  Democratic  candidate  in  the  United 
States  from  constable  to  Governor  and  Senator  will  know  that  this 
National  Organization  is  at  his  back  and  cheer  him  on  in  his  contest. 
We  can  make  Democracy  a  dominant  political  force  in  this  country 
for  generations  to  come.  Gentlemen,  I  thank  you.  [Applause.] 

The  newly  elected  Chairman,  Mr.  AVilliam  F.  MeCombs.  was  escorted 
to  the  chair. 

Mi:.  TAGGART:  Gentlemen,  members  of  the  Democratic  Naiional 
Committee,  I  have  the  pleasure  to  present  to  you  your  new  National 
Chairman,  .Mr,  McCombs,  [Applause,] 

(Mr,    Mack   handed   the   gavel    to    Mr.    McCombs.)       [Applause.) 

MK,  Mi'COMBs:  Gentlemen,  I  am  deeply  appreciative  of  the  honor 
&gt;vhii&gt;li  you  have  conferred  upon  mo.  I  can  hardly  believe  that  I  deserve 
it,  am!  I  consider  it  as  a  compliment  to  the  grout  man  whom  you  all 
|ia\r  as-isted  in  nominating  for  President  of  the  t'nitcd  States,  Governor 
\Voodro\v  AVilson.  [Applause.] 

I  shall  endeavor,  of  course,  to  fulfill  the  functions  of  this  greal, 
office  to  the  utmost  of  my  ability.  But  I  realize  that  in  this  body  re- 


498  A  PPENDIX 

poses  a  great  fleal  of  the  strength  of  the  Democracy  of  which  you  are 
selected  as  representatives  in  your  respective  States.  In  you  is 
reposed  a  great  deal  of  power — and  justified  power.  And  I  hope  and 
know  that  I  will  obtain  the  earnest  co-operation  of  every  member  of 
this  Committee  in  the  great  endeavor  which  I  am  about  to  embark 
upon.  And  I  want  you  all  to  know  that  I  have  the  kindliest  feeling 
toward  every  member  of  this  Committee,  and  that  the  Governor  of  New 
Jersey  has  a  kindly  feeling  for  everyone. 

We  must  go  now  upon  a  campaign  of  harmony.  We  have  been 
through  a  pre-nomination  campaign  which  has  involved  the  names  of  a 
number  of  very  estimable  gentlemen  in  connection  with  the  Presidency 
of  the  United  States,  and  I  am  happy  to  say  that  we  have  all  come 
out  of  it  without  any  feeling  of  bitterness.  We  have  united  upon  :i 
candidate  whom  the  Democrats  can  support  and  whom  I  know  they  all  will 
support.  I  earnestly  hope  that  in  this  endeavor  into  which  I  am  about 
to  embark,  you  will  all  feel  that  I  need  your  advice  and  your 
assistance,  and  I  trust  that  you  will  tender  it  freely.  [Applause.] 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  The  next  business  is  the  selection  of  the  Secretary 
of  this  Committee. 

MR.  HUDSPETH:  Mr.  Chairman.  I  nominate  for  the  next  Secretary 
of  this  Committee  Mr.  Josepn  E.  Davies,  of  Wisconsin. 

MR.  OSBORNE:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  take  pleasure  in  seconding  the 
motion. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Are  there  any  further  nominations?  If  not,  all  in 
favor  of  Mr.  Davies  will  say  aye.  [Chorus  of  ayes.} 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     Those  opposed,  no.     [No  response.] 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :   Mr.  Davies  is  elected. 

MR.  COSTELLO:  Mr.  Chairman,  after  listening  to  the  addresses  of  the 
members  of  this  Committee,  I  want  to  say  that  I  have  a  little  message 
here  from  one  of  the  candidates  before  the  recent  Convention,  and  I 
think  it  would  be  of  interest  and  pleasure  to  all  of  the  members  of 
this  Committee.  It  reads  as  follows:  "My  dear  Costello:  You  arc  about 
to  start  to  meet  your  fellow  committeemen  at  Chicago.  I  write  this 
note  to  wish  you  a  pleasant  journey  and  a  safe  return.  I  hope  that 
the  Committee  will  form  its  plans  wisely  for  the  success  of  Wilson  and 
Marshall,  and  organize  for  the  campaign  immediately  and  thoroughly. 
Yours  truly,  Champ  Clark."  [Applause.] 

MR.  McGRAW:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  that  we  now  proceed  to  the 
completion  of  the  organization  of  the  Committee  by  electing  a  Sergeant- 
at-Arms  before  any  other  business  intervenes. 

MR.  GOLTRA:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  desire  to  place  in  nomination  the 
name  of  Col.  John  I.  Martin,  of  Missouri,  for  Sergeant  at-Arms. 

MR.  COVGHUN:      I  second  that   motion. 

MR.  TAGGART:  I  move  before  we  proceed  with  any  further  business 
that  our  new  Secretary  be  placed  in  office. 

A  VOICE:     Ask  him  to  make  a  speech. 


APPENDIX  499 

MR.  DA  VIES:  Mr.  Chairman,  and  Gentlemen  of  this  Committee:  f 
had  not  thought  it  would  be  necessary  to  be  formally  introduced  into 
office,  although  I  appreciate  the  courtesy  and  consideration  that  prompted 
the  act.  It  would  be  ungracious  of  me  if  I  did  not  say,  Mr.  Chairman 
and  Gentlemen,  that  I  appreciate  the  kindness  and  the  honor  that  you 
have  done  to  me.  I  recognize  in  it  a  recognition  not  of  any  particular 
merit,  but  perhai  s  of  the  Great  Middle  West  of  this  country,  from 
which  district  I  happen  to  come  and  in  which  I  am  fortunate  enough 
to  live.  I  have  only  this  to  say:  that  in  the  coming  campaign  all  of 
the  youth,  the  energy  and  the  insistence  of  purpose  that  I  can  put  inlo 
the  performance  of  the  duties  of  this  office  in  an  insistent  manner  will 
be  at  your  command.  It  will  be  my  purpose  to  so  act  that  I  may  be  as 
favorably  consii'.eied  at  the  end  of  my  term  of  office  as  the  two  distin- 
guished gentlemen,  the  Honorable  Chairman  and  the  Honorable  Secre- 
tary at  the  conclusion  of  their  term. 

Mi:.  DANIELS:  1  move  that  the  thanks  of  this  Committee  be  ex- 
tended Mr.  Woodson,  the  retiring  Secretary,  for  the  patriotic,  efficient 
and  accommodating  service  rendered  by  him  during  the  eight  years  he 
has  been  in  office. 

The  motion  was  duly  seconded. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     You   have  heard   the  motion. 

MR.  DAXIELS:      And  that   it  be  engrossed. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     All  in  favor  of  that  motion  say  aye. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :      Unanimously  carried. 

MR.  GOLTRA  ;  T  call  for  the  question  now  on  the  nomination  of  a 
Sergeant-at-Anna  That  is  now  in  order,  Mr.  Chairman. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Are  there  any  further  nominations?  If  not.  all 
those  in  favor  of  John  I.  Martin  for  Bergean-at-Arms,  say  aye. 

(A  chorus  of  ayes.) 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     Those  opposed,  no. 

(No  response.) 

THE  CHAIRMAX:      The  motion  is  unanimously  carried. 

MR.  MI-GI;A\V:  T  move  that  the  Chairman  tender  to  the  Honorable 
Cham))  Clark,  for  the  kindly  message  he  has  sent  by  the  member  of  this 
Committee  from  the  District  of  Columbia,  the  cordial  thanks  of  this 
Committee  and  that  it  be  done  by  wire. 

The  motion  was  duly  seconded. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     All  in  favor  of  that  motion  signify  by  saying  aye. 

(A  chorus  of  ayes.) 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     Opposed,  no. 

(No  response.) 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     The  motion  is  unanimously   carried. 

MR.  HrnspETH:  I  desire  to  move  the  adoption  of  a  resolution,  and 
1  wish  to  preface  the  offer  by  this  statement:  The  resolution  I  am 
about  1o  offer  calls  for  the  appointment  of  a  Campaign  Committee  for 
the  I'.-uiy.  ft  calls  for  the  appointment  of  a  Campaign  Committee 


500  APPENDIX 

through  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  power  being  given  by  the  members  of  this 
Committee.  The  resolution  when  I  read  it  will  speak  for  itself.  But 
I  want  the  members  of  this  Committee  to  understand  that  in  offering 
this  resolution  I  am  not  offering  a  resolution  that  is  unprecedented.  The 
appointment  of  a  Campaign  Executive  Committee  has  been  very  common 
with  this  Committee,  running  back  during  National  Campaigns  for 
years;  so  that  the  appointment  now  of  this  committee  will  not  be 
unusual.  It  was  thought,  in  view  of  the  kind  suggestion  of  the  former 
Chairman  and  members  of  this  Committee,  in  connection  with  the 
formation  of  a  Campaign  Committee  or  Executive  Committee,  or  the  es- 
tablishment of  a  program,  that  it  was  in  perfect  accord  with  those 
ideas,  the  proposition  1  am  now  about  to  make.  Am!,  1  wisli  to  ask 
for  the  hearty  co-operation  of  each  and  every  member  in  connection 
with  not  only  the  giving  of  power  to  the  Chair  to  make  the. appointment 
of  this  committee,  but  that  the  membeis  of  the  National  Committee  at 
all  times  act  in  hearty  accord  with  the  Committee  when  appointed,  if 
this  resolution  is  adoj ted.  I  ir.ove  the  adoption  of  the  resolution. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :     The  Secretary  will  read  the  resolution. 

THE  SECRETARY:  (Beading.)  "Resolved,  That  the  Chairman  l.»e 
authorized  and  empowered  to  select,  by  and  with  the  advice  of  the 
nominee  for  President,  a  Campaign  Committee  to  consist  of  not  less 
than  nine  members,  a  majority  of  whom  shall  be  members  of  the 
National  Committee;  said  Committee  to  be  vested  with  full  power  to 
conduct  the  National  Campaign  and  to  do  all^acts  and  things  necessary 
and  proper  to  carry  into  effect  the  objects  of  this  resolution.  This 
Committee  shall  have  power  also  to  appoint  a  Treasurer  of  the  National 
Committee,  and  all  committees  and  other  necessary  officers,  and  to 
establish  rules  governing  its  action.  The  Chairman  of  the  National 
Committee  shall  be  Chairman  of  this  Committee." 

MR.  HUDSPETH:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  the  adoption  of  the  reso- 
lution. 

MR.  TAGGART:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  second  the  motion  that  the  resolu- 
tion be  adopted,  and  I  feel,  as  Judge  Hudspeth  has  said,  that  in  this 
campaign  it  will  lie  the  duty  of  every  National  Committee. nan  to  give 
to  the  Chairman  and  to  give  this  Committee  that  he  may  appoint,  their 
hearty  and  loyal  support.  It  is  true,  that  as  the  resolution  says,  it  calls 
for  no  le?s  than  nine.  Every  member  of  the  National  Committee  can- 
not be  a  member  of  this  Executive  Committee.  But  I  feel,  whether 
they  are  members  or  not,  that  their  very  best  efforts  in  Their  own 
Spates  ;,ii-l  i.thor  States  should  be  given  to  this  Committee  and  to  the 
Chairman.  I  second  the  motion  for  its  adoption. 

MK.  MACK:  Mr.  Chairman.  1  am  in  hearty  accord  with  Judge 
ilii&lt;!yp,-!li  V  n  sdln!  ion,  He  *a\%  it  has  been  the  custom  for  years  tej

APPENDIX  501 

Mu.  GOLTRA:  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  me  that  Judge  Hudspeth  's 
n-sulution  is  exceedingly  ;i|i|in)|iri:iti&gt;.  If  I  recall,  the  resolution  states 
1  hat  the  committee  is  to  consist  of  nine — 

MR.   JIuDSi'ETH:      Not   less  than  that  many. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     Not  less  than  nine. 

.Mi:.  GOLTRA:  Not  kss  than  nine,  a  majority  of  whom  shall  be 
memliers  of  the  National  (  ounnittee.  It  seems  to  me  that  it  is  a  very 
{•ood  resolution,  and  1  desire  to  second  the  motion  to  adopt  the  reso- 
lution. 

MR.  TALBOTT:  I  want  to  say  that  I  second  the  motion,  with  the 
request  that  I  be  not  placed  on  the  Committee. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  All  those  in  favor  of  the  resolution  please  say 
aye. 

(A   chorus  of  ayes.) 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     Opposed,  no. 

(No  response.) 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :      The  resolution  is  unanimously  carried. 

MR.  TAGGART:  May  I  say  u  word  please.'  After  T  say  this,  why 
1  won't  do  any  more  talking.  [Laughter.]  With  the  assistance  of  the 
gentlemen  ]  nsent,  Indiana  was  able  to  land  the  Vice-Presidency. 

A  VOICE:     Once  more. 

Mi:.  TA&lt;;&lt;;ART:     I  didn't  say  once     more. 

A    VOICE:      Again,  then. 

MR.  TA&lt;;&lt;;ART:  It  is  only  a  few  hours  ride  from  Chicago  t'o  Indian- 
apolis, and  1  would  like  to  invite  the  gentlemen  who  are  here  assembled, 
after  they  get  through  with  their  business  here  today,  for  which  they 
have  been  called  here,  go  to  Indianapolis  and  pay  their  respects  to 
Governor  Marshall.  [Applause.] 

MR.  MACK:      I   second  the   motion. 

MR.  TAGGART:  And  if  we  decide  to  go,  we  will  make  arrangements 
for  the  number  of  members  who  can  go.  If  there  are  some  gentle- 
men who  want  to  go  East  from  there  after  visiting  Indianapolis,  I 
think  we  can  make  arrangements  for  some  of  them  to  go  back  to 
New  York,  say  that  night.  I  think  we  can  make  reservations,  if  we 
desire,  even  to  leave  Indianapolis  tomorrow  afternoon.  We  can  leave  here 
tonight  at  11:30  o'clock  and  take  a  sleeper  and  remain  in  it,  or  we 
can  leave  here  at  2:45  on  the  sleeper  and  go  to  Indianapolis,  and  get 
to  Indianapolis  at  8  o  'clock  in  the  morning,  and  get  breakfast,  and  then 
go  and  call  on  the  Governor.  So  that  if  you  have  your  business 
adjusted  here  so  that  yon  can  get  away,  I  would  be  glad  to  have  a  list 
of  people  who  will  go  so  that  we  can  make  rhe  necessary  arrangements 
to  take  care  of  them. 

MR.  DANIELS:  I  move  that  the  invitation  be  accepted  with  thanks, 
and  that  every  member  of  the  Committee  who  can  possibly  do  so  should 
enjoy  the  trip  to  Indianapolis. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chairman  sincerely  hopes  that  he  can  go  with 


502  APPENDIX 

the  Committee,  but  he  has  some  engagements  here  which  may  prevent 
him.  However,  I  will  give  myself  the  distinguished  pleasure  of  calling 
on  the  next  Vice-President  a  little  later. 

What  is  the  further   pleasure   of   the   Committee? 

MR.  McGRAW :  I  move  the  Secretary  of  this  Committee  be  authorized 
to  appoint  his  own  Assistant  Secretary  or  Associate  Secretary. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:   Do  I  hear  a  second  to  the  motion? 

SENATOR  GORE:    I  second  the  motion. 

MR.  WOOD:  I  didn't  say  anything  with  reference  to  that  resolution, 
but  we  are  all  heartily  in  favor  of  it.  I  hope  it  will  -be  nine  and  not 
many  move.  I  hope  it  will  not  be  scattered  all  along,  for  compliments, 
but  I  hope  it  will  be  a  close  working  force.  I  was  in  favor  of  the  Cam- 
paign Committee,  and  the  Chairman^of  the  National  Committee  as  the 
Chairman  of  the  Campaign  Committee.  Therefore,  I  was  heartily 
in  accord  with  this,  because  it  had  one  executive  head.  I  think  that 
resolution,  without  any  amendments,  carries  with  it  that  the  Chairman 
of  the  National  Committee  is  its  executive  head,  and  that  is  the 
Executive  Committee,  and  they  have  full  authority.  I  don't  think  it  is 
necessary  to  amend  that  a  particle. 

THE  .CHAIRMAN:   Is  there  any  further  dicussion  of  the  amendment  f 

MR.  M,ACK  :  I  was  going  to  suggest,  Mr.  Chairman,  that  the 
Chairman  of  the  National  Committee  should  be  directed  to  secure  head- 
quarters at  once,  because  it  will  take  some  few  days  before  your 
Committee  will  be  appointed.  You  are  here  in  Chicago.  You  may  want 
the  headquarters  here.  I  don't  know  that  you  will,  but  you  may.  It 
seems  to  me  the  Chairman  of  this  Committee  should  be  empowered  to 
forthwith  arrange  for  headquarters  here  or  elsewhere,  and  not  have  to 
wait  until  this  Committee  is  appointed.  I  think  that  the  members  will 
agree  with  me. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  Will  you  put  that  in"  the  form  "of  a  resolution. 

MR.  SULLIVAN  :  Is  it  possible  to  state  now  your  policy  as  to  head 
. quarters?  My  idea  on  that  is  this:  That  you  are  here  today,  and  if 
your  headquarters  is  going  to  be  at  a  certain  place,  Chicago  or  New 
York,  or  wherever  it  is,  it  would  satisfy  a  lot  to  have  that  settled  before 
they  go  home.  Of  course,  if  they  want  to  wait  until  the  Committee  is 
all  appointed,  and  that  is  settled,  why  well  and  good.  Many  of  the 
members  here  might  have  some  suggestions  to  make  along  that  line.  And 
if  it  could  be  done — in  fact,  I  think  if  all  those  things  are  closed  up  as 
soon  as  possible,  with  good  sense  and  judgment,  why  the  better,  be 
cause  you  will  avoid  the  pulling  and  the  hauling,  and  you  will  satisfy 
more  people  by  quick  action  than  you  will  by  a  delayed  proposition. 
If  we  can  go  out  into  the  country  today  with  many  of  these  things 
settled  there  would  not  be  as  much  pulling  and  hauling  and  quibbling 
as  if  you  string  it  along  for  a  week  or  two  more  and  the  news- 
papers find  out  what  you  are  going  to  do  about  this,  writing  it  up  and 
so  forth.  I  merely  make  that  suggestion. 


APPENDIX  503 

Mi;.  Cuuuiiux:  I  am  fully  in  accord  with  the  suggestions  made  by 
Mr.  Sullivan  because  experience  in  the  past  twenty-four  or  twenty-five 
years  indicates  that  we  have  postponed  too  long  the  preliminary  work 
of  the  organization. 

Now,  I  was  very  jiiurh  impressed  with  the  opening  remarks  of  the 
Chairman  relative  to  the  work  which  he  expected  from  the  members 
of  the  National  Committee,  placing  upon  each  member  of  each  State 
certain  responsibilities  from  which  he  is  not  absolved  after  the  Com- 
mittee which  is  to  be  selected  by  the  Chairman  has  been  made  up. 
L  want  that  for  this  reason — I  am  glad  that  was  stated  for  this  reason: 
That  it  has  been  intimated  by  some  of  our  Republican  friends  that  the 
National  Committee  was  to  be  absorbed  and  eliminated  by  the  new 
organization.  I  knew  that  wasn't  so,  and  I  have  already  refuted 
publicly  any  such  charge  that  was  alleged,  and  they  are  waiting  now 
to  find  out  whether  there  is  to  be  a  personal  organization  or  an  organ- 
ization of  the  whole  Committee.  And  I  want  to  say  to  you,  Mr. 
Chairman,  that  so  far  as  my  State  is  concerned,  we  will  be  in  strict 
accord  and  will  follow  the  policy  outlined  by  that  Committee,  and 
will  render  such  service,  independent  of  whatever  the  Committee  itself 
may  do,  relying  upon  ourselves  and  perform  that  service  in  a  way  that 
will  be  beneficial  to  the  head  of  the  ticket  and  the  organization  gen- 
erally. And  I  hope  that  the  statement  made  by  the  Chairman  will 
be  circulated  liberally  all  over  the  country,  that  the  National  Organiza- 
tion stands  as  a  unit  back  of  the  Committee  selected,  and  that  the 
Chairman  of  this  Committee  relies  upon  the  labors  and  the  zeal  and  the 
efforts  of  each  National  Committeeman  in  the  various  States  of  the 
Union  to  give  to  him  the  fullest  measure  of  their  service  in  the  con- 
flict that  is  now  before  us. 

I  am  also  pleased  that  the  Chairman  has  taken  the  position  and 
imposed  upon  us  the  duty  of  seeing  to  it  that  he  is  advised  of  the 
political  conditions  in  our  States,  because,  Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  no 
man  in  any  Commonwealth  of  this  Republic  who  is  more  familiar  with 
the  dangers  that  we  have  got  to  face,  and  the  complex  problems  which 
we  have  got  to  settle  than  the  men  who  have  been  selected  in  those 
States  by  the  delegates  and  who  were  sent  to  represent  those  States 
either  whether  they  were  elected  by  the  old  system  of  the  Convention  or 
by  the  preferential  primary.  And  I  say  this  advisedly,  Mr.  Chairman, 
because  it  is  nothing  new  to  me.  I  have  devoted  twenty-five  years  of  my 
life  to  the  service  of  the  party,  and  I  have  seen  some  very  great 
blunders  made.  I  have  seen  some  serious  mistakes  made  by  the  most 
experienced  men  at  the  most  inopportune  moment,  mistakes  that  crushed 
our  hopes,  and  subsided  our  aspirationsr  by  the  fact  that  people  who 
were  not  familiar  \\itli  the  political  conditions  of  their  States  sometimes 
being  taken  in  as  advisors,  and  they  sometimes  represented  factions, 
and  those  were  all  inimical  to  the  best  results  and  the  desired  results  of 
every  honest,  patriotic,  decent  Democrat  in  the  country.  And  I  say 


504  APPENDIX 

to  you.  Mr.  Chaiiman. — and  I  do'  not  say  it  because  I  belie",  e  that  im 
judgment  is  hotter  th:.n  youis.  but  it  is  1  ecause  I  liave  in  day-i  g  n, 
fought  many  c;:mpaigns  and  I  know  tl.at  you  will  rely  upon  the  ad\  i.-r 
largely  of  :hos&gt;  nun  \\ ho  have  been  selected  by  their  variou-  States, 
whom  you  believe  will  bring  to  yen  honest  information  that  wiil  as 
you  in  fighting  the  tattle  that  you  have  now  had  placed  in  yi.ur  hands 
to  fight.  And  i  believe,  as  1  stated  at  the  beginning,  that  the  quicker 
we  do  this  work,  the  quicker  that  we  select  our  headquarters  and  tho 
quicker  we  consummate  our  organization,  why,  the  more  ready  we  ;u  • 
for  the  fight,  and  the  better  work  we  can  do  in  the  next  four  month-. 
I  believe  that  in  the  last  campaigns  \\e  were  delayed  by  many  weeks,  and 
these  delays  were  net  for  the  best  interests  of  the  party,  although  that 
was  in  a  way  because  the  National  Committee  had  taken  no  action  as  ,1 
whole.  And  I  hope,  in  accordance  with  the  suggestion  made,  tha: 
Chicago.  Illinois,  will  be  accepted  i\v  this  Committee;  that  they  will 
designate  this  as  their  headquarters,  so  that  when  we  go  out  of 
today  we  are  open  to  battle.  [Applause.] 

MR.  TALEOTT:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  in  accord  with  the  -  _. 
made,  but  1  do  not  think  it  fair  to  the  gentlemen  to  be  associated  with 
you  on  this  Committee  that  you  should  at  once  say  what  you  arc  going 
to  do.  because  the  organization  of  that  Committee  is  for  the  pur;ioje  o;' 
establishing  headquarters  and  conducting  this  campaign.  Now.  I  agree 
with  all  of  the  men  that  the  quicker  it  is  done  the  better.  Name  your 
committee  just  as  soon  as  possible,  and  then  select  your  headquarters. 
I  do  not  think,  with  great  respect  to  the  Chairman,  that  the  Chaiim.'ii 
ought  to  go  ahead  with  the  work  and  then  call  the  Committee  to 
ratify  it,  because  they  may  have  some  good  suggestions  and  some  go •••'• 
advice  to  give  you. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    I  think   Mr.   Talbott 's  point   is  well   taken.      How 
ever,   this   Committee    will   be   selected    very   quickly,   and    1    quite    :;j 
with   the  gentleman   from   Massachusetts  that   we  ought   to   get   our   or 
ganizntior.  perfected  quickly  and  get  the  work  started  at  once. 

MR.  CoutJHUN:  I  am  making  the  suggestion,  while  the  Committee 
may  not  desire  at  this  time  to  impose  upon  the  Chairman  the 
bility  of  making  the  suggestion  as  to  location,  yet  I  do  not  believe  that 
the  Chairman  would  feel  that  the  Committee  was  going  too  far  if  the 
Committee  now  suggested  to  the  Chairman  what  it  believed  to  be  the 
correct  location  of  the  headquarters. 

THE  CIIAIUMAN:    J   will  be  delighted   to   have  tho-     -    __   -tions. 

.him::  Hrnsi-KTH:  In  connection  with  this  matter  that  has  been 
discussed,  we  do  know  one  member  of  this  Executive  Committee.  e»ur 
Campaign  Committee,  and  that  is  yourself.  And  I  feel  sure,  from  your 
experieme  in  these  matters,  that  you  will  invite  from  the  members  of  the 
National  Committee  their  ideas  as  to  where  the  headquarters  should  In- 
i -;alilished.  There  are  gentlemen  here  from  all  the  different  States, 
for  t'nei--  standing  in  the  party,  representing  their  party  in  their 


APPENDIX  505 

respective  States,  and  they  are  familiar  with  the  conditions  in  the 
•lifl'erent  States.  I  think  that  you  would  be  only  too  willing  to  invite 
suggestions  from  these  gentlemen,  giving  you  information,  so  that  you 
can  convey  this  to  the  Committee  when  appointed.  And  I  know  that 
the  information  you  get  will  be  very  illuminating  and  valuable. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  That  is  quite  in  accordance  with  my  preliminary 
statement.  I  would  like  the  advice  of  the  entire  Committee,  or  every 
member  of  the  Committee,  and  it  will  be  considered  as  an  advantage 
now  or  at  any  other  time. 

MR.  MOORE  :  I  simply  rise  to  inquire.  It  has  been  suggested  that  it 
is  the  purpose  of  the  Campaign  Committee  to  co-operate  with  the  Com- 
mitteemen  of  the  various  States.  It  was  very  properly  suggested  that  it 
is  the  duty  of  the  Committeeinen  to  give  to  the  Chairman  every  aid. 
Now,  we  Democrats,  as  well  as  the  Republicans,  do  not  altogether 
agree.  At  times  we  have  what  is  known  in  common  parlance  or  what  is 
designated  as  factions.  I  rise  to  inquire  whether  it  is  the  purpose 
of  the  Chairman  to  consult  with  the  member  from  a  State  before  the 
selection  of  the  members  of  that  Campaign  Committee  be  made.  I 
would  suggest,  in  the  interest  of  harmonious  working,  that  each  be 
consulted. 

I  take  it  for  granted  that  that  is  true,  and  I  only  rise  to  the 
inquiry. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  I  believe  the  resolution  reads,  "by  and  with  the 
advice  of  the  nominee. ' '  The  Chairman,  of  course,  will  be  delighted  to 
have  the  individual  suggestions  of  every  member  of  this  Committee  upon 
the  composition  of  that  Committee. 

MR.  MOORE  :  Mr.  Chairman,  the  members  of  the  Committee,  like 
myself,  have  no  desire  to  impose  their  suggestions  upon  the  Chairman 
or  upon  the  candidate,  who  undoubtedly  has  given  this  matter  more 
thought  than  any  member  of  the  Committee  has  given.  Unless  it  was 
the  purpose  of  the  Chairman  to  select  a  member  of  the  Committee  from 
any  particular  State,  for  instance,  I  have  no  desire  to  give  advice 
unless  asked  for  it,  but  I  realize  the  difficulty  the  Chairman  is  in 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  I  invite  your  advice,  Mr.  Moore,  upon  the  question. 

MR.  MOORE:  I  don't  care  to  impose  it.  As  I  say,  I  understand  the 
complexities  with  which, the  Chairman  has  to  deal  under  circumstances 
like  this,  and  I  don 't  care  to  impose  advice,  as  I  say,  unless  there  was 
a  desire  in  the  mind  of  the  Chairman  to  select  a  member  from  my 
particular  State.  I  truly  think  my  advice  then  might  be  worth 
something. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  I  invite  you,  Mr.  Moore,  and  all  other  members 
of  the  Committee,  to  make  suggestions,  and  to  give  me  that  advice 
upon  that  point,  as  well  as  all  other  points. 

MR.  TAGGART":  Mr.  Chairman,  in  regard  to  the  discussion  as  to  head- 
quarters, and  the  time  for  selecting  it,  I  want  to  say  this:  I  presume, 
if  there  is  only  one  headquarters,  there  will  be  but  two  cities  considered, 


506  APPENDIX 

and  one  would  be  Chicago  an*  the  other  would  be  New  Y'm-k.  Why 
would  it  not  be  a  good  time  for  the  members  to  discuss  it.  For  instance, 
there  would  be  one  headquarters,  A  one  of  the  two  cities,  it  might  be 
here  or  in  New  York. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :  I  think  discussion  upon  that  point  would  be 
proper. 

Ms.  LYNCH:  That  was  the  purpose  of  it.  I  believe  there  should 
be  one.  I  think  the  headquarters  should  be  in  Chicago  or  New  York. 
Probably  every  member  of  the  Committee  has  his  preference  as  to 
where  the  headquarters  should  be. 

SENATOR  GORE:  It  occurred  to  me  it  might  be  necessary  to  have 
sub-headquarters  here  and  there,  probably  in  the  far  West.  It  seems 
to  me  that  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  that  is  proposed  would 
govern;  his  wishes  will  be  considered  in  all  instances,  and  he  certainly 
can  be  intrusted  with  the  designation  of  the  place  where  the  head- 
quarters will  be.  I  don't  know  but  what  yon  will  experience  some 
trouble — you  will  call  down  more  trouble  than  you  will  obviate  when 
you  go  into  detail. 

MR.  TAGGART:     I  will  withdraw  my  suggestion. 

COL.  E\VING:'  I  disagree  with  Senator  Gore.  I  think  something  ought. 
to  be  left  to  the  Committee.  I  don 't  think  that  there  is  anything  that 
this  Committee  can  undertake  to  act  upon  better  than  the  selection  of  the 
cities  in  which  they  propose  to  maintain  headquarters.  It  goes  without 
saying,  and  I  believe  it  is  in  the  minds  of  everybody,  that  we  will 
have  headquarters  in  Chicago  and  in  New  York.  But  the  question  of 
headquarters  in  the  West  is  a  broad  proposition.  We  have  here  today 
men  from  the  far  West,  the  Pacific  Coast.  They,  I  think,  more  properly 
and  more  intelligently  could  suggest  as  to  where  the  headquarters 
ought  to  be  in  the  West.  We  ought  to  take  that  up  today.  I  don 't 
think  it  is  -any  infringement  on  the  rights  or  the  functions  of  this 
proposed  Committee  to  be  selected  under  the  resolution  of  Judge 
Hudspeth,  even  if  this  Committee  went  so  far  as  to  designate  today 
the  points  at  which  we  should  have  headquarters  after  a  free  discus  im. 
of  the  matter  here.  I  think  if  we  are  going  to  act  promptly  in  this 
matter,  we  can  act  more  promptly  after  getting  the  views  of  the  mem- 
bers from  the  far  West  as  to  the  proper  location  for  the  western  head- 
quarters than  we  could  after  waiting  for  this  Committee  to  be  appointed 
and  then  for  this  Committee  to  seek  that  information  from  the  very 
men  that  are  here  today,  and  get  the  information  then.  I  think  that 
we  ought  to  go  ahead  with  it  now.  * 

I  move  that  we  now  take  up  the  subject  of  selecting  headquarters, 
as  far  as  the  city  is  concerned.  We  can  leave  to  this  Campaign  Com- 
mittee the  location  of  the  site,  as  to  whether  it  should  be  outside  of 
hotels  or  inside  of  hotels. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    What   is  that?     I  don't   hear  you. 

Mr:.    K\VIN&lt;;:    T   say  that   I   move   that   this   Committee   now   take   up 


APPENDIX  507 

the  subject  cf  the  location  of  the  headquarters,  that  is,  in  what  cities 
they  shall  he  located,  and  leave  to  this  Campaign  Committee,  after  it  is 
selected,  the  designation  of  the  particular  cities  where  the  headquarters 
should  be. 

THE   CHAIRMAN:    What    is    the    motion! 

M:;.  LYNCH:  I  believe  I  had  the  floor  when  I  was  interrupted.  I 
want  it.  I  have  got  something  to  say.  and  I  am  going  to  s-.iy  it. 

A   VOICE:    All   right.     Go  on. 

MR.  LYNCH:  I  think  it  is  eminently  proper  that  the  members  of  this 
Committee  should  express  to  the  Executive  Committee,  if  it  shall  be  BO 
difficult  to  agree  upon  it,  where  they  believe  the  headquarters  should  be. 
There  can  1&gt;?  only  cue  headquarters.  Whether  it  is  at  Chicago  or  New 
York  is  a  matter  of  opinion.  But  there  can  be  only  one.  Whether 
there  should  be  sub-headquarters  or  not  should  be  left  to  the  Executive 
Committee.  And.  inasmuch  as  1  had  the  floor,  I  am  going  to  make  a 
motion  that  this  National  Committee  take  a  vote  of  recommendation 
to  the  Executive  Committee,  by  a  majority  vote,  as  to  whether  the  head- 
quarters shall  be  in  Chicago  or  New  York. 

MR.  TAGGART:  The  main  headquarters.  There  is  only  one  head- 
quarters. 

COL.  K  \VING:  Aien't  you  going  to  discuss  at  the  same  time  the  sub- 
headquarters  .' 

MR.  LYNCH:   Xo. 

COL.  EWING:   That  is  the  important  thing  to  be  done. 

Mu.   LYNCH:    Let   it   be  taken  up  later. 

COL.    EWINU:    Let   it   be  taken   up   today. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  I  believe  Col.  Ewiug  has  a  motion  before  the 
house.  Perhaps  he  withdraws  his  motion. 

COL.  EwiNt;:  If  you  are  going  to  take  up  the  location  as  to  head- 
quarters on  the  question  between  Chicago  and  New  York  I  have  no 
objection.  I  think  we  ought  to  take  counsel  with  the  members  from 
the  West  as  to  where  the  sub-headquarers,  if  you  want  to  so  term  it. 
ought  to  be  located. 

JUDGE  HUD.SPETH-  Will  yon  permit  me  to  offer  a  motion  that 
should  precede  yours,  properly?  I  will  tell  you  what  it  is:  That  in 
the  choice  of  headquarters,  wherever  they  are  located,  that  those 
headquarters  shall  be  established  in  an  office  building  and  not  in  any 
hotel  building.  I  make  that  as  a  motion. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  T  don't  quite  understand.  Is  there  a  motion 
still  before  the  Ho; 

JUDGE  HUDSPETH:     T  withdraw   it.  then. 

MR.  POWELL:  It  occurs  to  me — I  want  to  offer  this  as  a  substitute 
to  my  friend's  motion  here — it  occurs  to  me  we  have  turned  over  the 
management  of  th:s  campaign  to  a  Central  Executive  Committee,  and 
that  Committee  we  expect  to  hold  responsible  for  its  successful  conclu- 
sion. (Cries  of  "Hear,  hear!")  My  idea  about  it  is,  sir.  that  the 


508  APPENDIX 

establishment  of  a  campaign  headquarters  in  any  particular  city  is  a 
matter  that  ought  to  be  left  to  the  discretion  of  this  Campaign  .Com- 
mittee. And  I  move  now,  as  a  substitute,  that  the  whole  matter  be 
referred  to  that  Committee  with  discretion  that  hey  ac  as  they  please. 

The  motion  was  seconded  by  several  committeemen. 

Gov.  ELLYSON  :  Mr.  Chairman,  if  anybody  has  any  interest  iu  the 
matter,  it  ought  to  be  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee. 

His  convenience  ought  to  be  consulted  more  than  that  of  the  other 
members.  But  we  have  referred  this  matter  to  a  Committee,  as  has 
just  been  suggested,  and  it  ought  to  be  left  there,  with  all  the  questions 
that  grow  out  of  it.  Why  should  we  undertake  to  settle  matters  of 
detail  when  we  have  by  formal  resolution  authorized  the  creation  of  a 
Committee  to  whom  we  have  referred  all  the  questions  of  importance 
relating  to  the  campaign?  I  therefore  hope  it  will  be  the  pleasure  of 
this  Committee  not  to  determine  upon  any  locality  as  a  place  where  the 
headquarters  shall  be  established,  but  leave  that  to  the  Committee  on 
whose  judgment  I  am  sure  we  can  rely. 

MR  WOOD:  Mr.  Chairman,  in  order  that  we  may  have  action  by  the 
Committee  on  this  matter,  I  want  to  support  the  substitute  that  was 
offered,  that  it  be  referred  with  power  to  act  to  the  Chairman  of  the 
Executive  Committee;  I  want  to  support  that.  It  seems  to  me  a 
thousand  things  are  going  to  come  up.  We  might  as  well  talk  copper 
rivets  and  brass  tacks  here.  We  might  make  headquarters  and  sub- 
headquarters  and  might  find  we  are  duplicating  the  work,  costing  us 
thousands  of  dollars,  and  we  might  not  have  that  money  at  all.  I 
think  we  have  a  good  executive  head  and  a  good  Executive  Committee. 
I  think  the  best  thing  we  can  do  is  to  leave  it  with  them. 

MR.  JELKS:  I  move  you  that  the  motion  and  the  substitute  be  laid 
on  the  table. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     Is  there  a  second? 

The  motion  was  seconded. 

MR.  MANLEY:  I  rise  to  a  point  of  order.  I  believe  all  this  matter 
has  been  delegated  to  this  Committee.  These  motions  are  all  out  of 
urdor,  regardless  of  what  merit  they  may  have.  The  authority  to 
fix  that  has  been  delegated  to  the  Committee.  I  believe  all  of  this  is 
out  of  order. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  I  think  the  matter  is  in  order.  It  does  seem  to 
the  Chair,  however,  that  the  question  has  been  previously  covered  by  the 
resolution  as  adopted. 

MR.  DOOLEY:  It  seems  the  idea  that  Mr.  Lynch,  of  Minnesota,  and 
Colonel  Ewing,  of  Louisiana,  had  in  mind,  was  not  to  tie  the  hands  in 
any  way  of  this  Sub-Committee,  but,  while  the  National  Committee 
was  here,  to  get  an  expression  of  opinion  for  such  information  and 
guidance  to  the  chairman  of  the  Committee  as  possible.  Mr.  Lynch 's 
motion,  as  I  understood  it,  was  only  a  recommendation  or  suggestion, 
and  not  one  which  bound  the  Sub-Committee  in  any  way,  shape  or  form. 


APPENDIX  509 

.Mu.  GOLTRA:  Mr.  Chairman,  in  this  jumble  of  resolutions  we  have 
just  had  in  the  last  ten  minutes  here,  this  thought  comes  queerly  to  me. 
I  think  they  were  all  unnecessary.  The  chairman,  after  a  number  of 
gentlemen  had  stated  to  him,  that  is,  several  of  the  gentlemen  had 
stated  to  him,  that  they  thought  it  would  be  well  to  discuss  this  matter, 
immediately  said  to  us  he  would  be  glad  to  have  the  views  of  all  of 
the  members  of  the  Committee,  and  if  you  will  recall,  he  asked  that  the 
roll — or  was  just  about  to  ask  that  the  roll  be  called,  in  order  that  the 
various  committeemen  might  state  what  they  thought  about  the  matter, 
the  Chair  simply  desired  to  yet  the  opinion  of  all  of  us.  That  was  all 
their  was  to  it.  The  resolutions  are  not  necessary;  and  if  the  Chair 
still  i!t  sins  to  hear  from  them,  why  not  call  the  roll,  and  if  any  one 
wants  to  rise  and  say  anything,  let  him  say  it.  We  have  delegated  full 
authority  to  this  Committee,  and  I  don't  think  that  the  resolutions  are 
neressaiy  whatsoever,  Mr.  Chairman. 

MR.  JKLKS:  I  made  a  motion  to  lay  the  motion  and  substitute 
on  the  table,  and  I  think  if  we  were  to  take  a  vote  here,  as  is  suggested, 
it  would  only  embarrass  the  Chairman  and  the  Nominee.  They  would 
feel  almost  forced,  perhaps,  to  follow  the  suggestion,  which  they  might 
consider  to  be  very  unwise.  I  therefore  made  the  motion  to  lay  the 
motion  of  .Mr.  Lynch  and  the  substitute  of  Judge  Powell  on  the  table. 

MR.  T.UiGART:      I  second  that  motion. 

MR.   EWIXG:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  think — 

THE  CHAIRMAN:     This  is  not  debatable,  Colonel  Ewing. 

MK.  KWIXG:  We  are  here  discussing  it.  I  don't  think  we  ought 
to  proceed  with  this  kind  of  method. 

MR.  TAGGART:  May  I  say  a  word?  I  feel  that  in  the  organization 
of  this  new  Committee  there  are  going  to  be  a  great  many  questions 
coining  up.  and  when  it  comes  to  the  question  of  locating  headquarters, 
if  a  vote  was  taken  to-day,  it  might  be  in  opposition  to  what  you 
wish  and  what  your  Committee  might  want,  and,  as  the  gentleman  from 
Alabama  said,  it  might  embarrass  you  somewhat.  The  questions  of 
sub-committees  or  sub-headquarters  are  matters  that  will  have  to  be 
'determined  by  this  Committee  in  regard  to  the  various  locations  or  States 
in  which  the  campaign  will  have  to  be  made;  and  I  believe  there  is 
but  one  question  that  should  come  up/  and  that  would  be  that  this 
Committee  that  we  have  empowered  the  Chairman  to  appoint  should 
have  a  right  to  select  a  location,  and  later  in  their  judgment,  if  they 
desire  additional  headquarters  in  different  parts  of  the  United  States, 
the  resolution  gives  them  the  right  to  carry  the  campaign  on.  I  think 
you  will  find,  if  3*011  take  a  vote  to-day,  or  if  you  take  the  expressions, 
it  may  be  in  perfect  accord  of  what  the  Executive  Committee  might 
desire,  but  it  might  be  in  variance  with  it;  but  whatever  the  expression 
oi'  tliis  Committee  \\a*.  they  would  either  have  to  follow  it  or  be  em- 
barrasM'il  by  avoiding  it  and  1  believe  tlieie  is  not  a  Democrat  in  the 
room  or  a  man  on  the  Committee  who  does  not  feel  that  this  Committee, 


510  Al'I'EXDIX 

whoever  they  may  be.  should  have  the  power  to  carry  on  the  campaign, 
in  conjunction  with  the  Chairman  and  Governor  Wilson,  just  as  they 
wish  and  choose.  I  believe  it  will  be  unwise  for  us  to  embarrass  the 
chairman  by  asking  or  trying  to  locate  the  headquarters  to-day.  I  have 
confidence  in  whoever  the  committee  may  be.  that  they  will  have  enough 
trouble  in  doing  the  thing  just  right,  and  I  believe  the  thing  to  do 
to-day  is  to  leave  it  in  the  hands  of  the  Chairman  to  appoint  his 
committee  and  select  the  place  of  1m  headquarters  and  additional  sub- 
headquarters,  if  necessary. 

THE  CHAIRMAN':  The  question  is  upon  Governor  Jelk 's  motion  to 
lay  the  original  motion  and  substitute  upon  the  table. 

MR.   MACK:     Mr.  Chairman — 

Mi:.  JELKS:  I  withdraw  it,  if  Mr.  Mack  wants  to  talk,  until  he 
gets  through. 

MR.  MACK:  Mr.  Chairman.  I  am  going  back  to  my  original  sugges- 
tion. Mr.  Taggart,  who  preceded  me  as  Chairman  of  the  Committee, 
I  see,  has  the  same  thing  in  mind.  The  headquarters  don't  amount  to 
much,  if  that  is  all  we  are  going  to  have,  headquarters.  The  first  thing 
after  you  ha%-e  headquarteis,  the  Chairman  mvrst  take  up — and  I  wil; 
tell  him  something  that  he  don't  know,  that  he  is  up  against,  and  he 
might  be  ready  for  it — the  matter  of  printing  is  the  important  thing. 
Headquarters  is  easy.  The  next  thing  is  to  get  the  headquarters  equipped 
with  printing.  Four  years  ago  we  lost  two  weeks  before  we  got  a 
Chairman.  This  year  we  have  lost  ten  days.  We  are  a  little  bit  better 
off  than  we  were  four  yeais  ago.  I  needed  that  two  weeks  badly  for 
the  purpose  of  getting  out  my  printing.  The  first. thing  this  Chairman 
will  want  when  he  gives  it  consideration,  which  he  probably  has  now, 
will  be  the  ordering  of  printing;  and  I  want  to  say  now,  he  will  not 
only  have  to  order  the  printing,  but  he  will  have  to  guarantee  the  pay- 
ment of  it  himself  before  he  will  get  it.  And  he  needs  time  to  order 
it;  that  ought  to  be  begun  at  once.  There  are  two  things  that  the 
chairman  of  this  committee  should  be  permitted  to  do  forthwith,  that  is 
to  ](  rate  his  headquarters  wherever  he  thinks  best,  and  the  next  is  to  be 
permitted  to  order  his  printing,  because  it  takes  weeks  to  get  the 
printing.  If  he  don't  do  that,  he  is  robbing  the  Committee  of  a  great 
deal  of  neci&gt;sary  time.  You  will  have  difficulty  in  getting  your  printing 
out  anyway,  and  if  you  don 't  order  it  at  once,  you  won 't  have  your 
printing  in  time.  The  printing  is  of  no  use  to  you  in  November,  in 
October.  You  have  got  to  have  it  in  August,  some  of  it ;  early  in 
•  •nibcr,  all  of  it.  There  are  two  things  the  Chairman  should  lie 
permitted  to  do,  and  that  is  to  locate  his  headquarters  at  onc'e,  in  order 
that  lie  may  be  equipped  properly.  It  takes  time  to  do  that.  -  It  tukes 
a  good  deal  of  time  to  prepare  them  and  get  them  ready  for  occupancy. 
The  next  thing  is  the  matter  of  printing.  That  he  will  have  to  do 
anyuay.  Some  man  must  do  that,  anyway,  and  the  Chairman  will  have 
In  it.  That  the  Committee  cannot  very  well  do  because  they  will 


APPENDIX  511 

lie  putting  it  off  from  one  man  to  the  other,  and  the  Chairman  should 
have  that  authority.  And  I  hope  this  committee  will  now  give  the 
chairman  of  the  committee  the  authority  to  arrange  for  his  headquarters. 
Whatever  may  he  done  afterwards  in  the  way  of  sub-headquarters,  that 
is  another  matter,  but  he  should  be  permitted  to  secure  his  headquarters 
now  and  order  the  printing  at  once.  If  not,  a  great  mistake  will  be 
made  on  the  part  of  this  Committee. 

(Cries  of  "Question.") 

MR.  SULLIVAN:     Mr.  Chairman,  is  there  anything  before  the  house? 

THE  CHAIRMAN:      Governor  Jelk's  motion   is  before  the  house. 

MR.  SILLIVAN:  I  am  going  to  suggest  this,  that  all  these  motions 
be  withdrawn,  but  the  original  resolution. 

MR.  JELKS:      We  will  lay  them  all  on  the  table  in  a  minute. 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I  know,  but  you  will  be  better  off  without 
them,  you  will  be  better  off  without  a  vote.  Now,  here  the  only 
tiling  that  our  Chairman  needs  is  this,  is  to  get  down  to  the  real 
1  nisi  ness.  We  are  a  little  bit  at  sea  because  of  the  want  of  knowing 
just  exactly  what  is  wanted  to  be  done.  I  believe  the  location  of  the 
headquarters  is  an  executive  proposition  which  ought  to  be  left  there. 
I  don 't  think  we  ought  to  have  a  motion  to  designate  the  city,  and  I 
don't  think  we  ought  to  have  a  motion  to  lay  that  motion  upon  the 
table  as  being  oppcsed  to  a  city.  Leave  it  where  it  is.  The  principal 
tiling  you  want  to  do,  as  suggested  by  Mr.  Mack,  are  the  printing  and 
tilings  of  that  kind,  which  are  very  necessary,  the  sooner  you  get  to 
work,  the  better.  If  the  Chairman  will  say  that  the  designation  of 
headquarters  and  designation  of  the  Committee  will  be  made  in  a  day 
or  a  week,  we  will  know  pretty  near  how  fast  we  are  traveling  along. 
If  there  are  any  other  things  to  come  up  before  this  committee  we 
want  to  bring  them  up.  I  think  this  location  proposition  ought  to  be 
dropped  without  a  vote,  without  it  going  out  to  the  press  that  we 
designated  this  place  or  that  place,  or  turned  this  place  or  that  place 
down.  That  is  one  of  the  reasons  I  suggested  to  the  gentlemen  who 
made  both  motions,  that  they  be  withdrawn,  and  let  the  question  stay 
where  it  is.  and  it  will  make  it  better  all  around. 

MR.  POWELL:  I  am  willing  to  withdraw  my  substitute  if  he  with- 
draws the  motion. 

MR.  KWING:  I  am  perfectly  willing  to  withdraw  the  motion  if  we 
have'  discussion  about  the  location  of  the  "place,  so  the  Chairman  may 
have  information  on  the  subject. 

MR.   GOLTRA:     He  started  out  to  do  that  originally. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  I  would  like  suggestions  not  only  upon  that,  but 
on  all  other  questions. 

Mu.  POWELL:  I  don't  think  the  suggestions  would  do  any  good, 
for  the  reason  it  might  be  that  this  committee  might  make  a  suggestion 
which  the  Central  Committee  might  not  deem  it  wise  to  follow,  and 
then  we  would  have  the  idea  of  a  creature  overriding  its  creator;  we 


512  APPENDIX 

would  have  the  position  of  the  Central  Committee  doing  something  the 
whole  Committee  had  instructed  him  to  do,  or  failing  to  do  it.  Let 
them  suggest  it  to  them  in  writing  or  privately,  but  I  don't  see  any 
use  taking  the  consensus  of  this  body  upon  the  subject. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Then  I  understand  the  motions  have  all  been  with- 
drawn. 

MR.  JELKS:     I  don't  know  whether  they  are  withdrawn  or  not. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Colonel  Swing's  motion,  then  the  substitute,  and 
your  motion  to  table,  I  understand  have  been  all  withdrawn; 

MB.  BOESCHENSTEIN:  Mr.  Chairman.  I  have  a  resolution  of  strictly 
routine  character,  and  I  would  ask  the  Secretary  to  re:id  it. 

"NVhereupon    the   Secretary   read    the   following   resolution: 

"Besolvcd,  that  the  retiring  Secretary  of  this  Committee,  Mr.  Wood- 
son,  be  and  he  hereby  is  directed  to  compile  and  have  put  in  printed 
form  the  proceedings  of  the  Baltimore  Convention. ' ' 

MB.  BOESCUEXSTEIX  :  Mr.  Chairman,  in  explanation  of  the  resolu- 
tion, I  desire  to  state  that  the  record  of  the  Baltimore  Convention  was 
prepared  by  Mr.  AVoodson  and  is  now  in  the  hands  of  the  printer. 

MR.  WOODSON:  No,  that  is  not  true;  it  is  not  in  the  hands  of  the 
printer. 

Mu.  BOESCHENSTEIN:   The  proofs. 

MR.  WOODSON  :  Oh,  no ;  the  official  stenographer  has  not  finished  the 
work. 

MR.  BOESCHENSTEIN  :  Then  I  was  misinformed.  My  information 
was  that  the  matter  was  in  the  hands  of  the  printer.  But  notwithstand- 
ing that,  Mr.  Woodson  has  prepared  the  record,  and  in  order  that  there 
may  be  no  confusion  in  getting  out  the  proceedings,  the  work  should 
properly  be  finished  by  the  man  who  had  charge  of  the  record  during 
the  Convention,  and  that  is  my  reason  for  offering  the  resolution. 

Mi:.  KING:  I  second  the  motion.  Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  nothing 
said  in  that  resolution  as  to  the  number  of  copies  that  may  be  printed, 
but  I  presume  that  will  be  left  to  the  Secretary.  Is  that  the  intenion? 

MR.  BOESCHENSTEIN  :  The  usual  number,  the  usual  number  of  copies. 

Mi:.  WOODSON :   \Ve  generally  have  about  ten  thousand  copies  printed. 

MR.  ELLYSON:  Mr.  Chairman,  it  seems  to  me  a  smaller  number  of 
copies  than  ten  thousand  would  be  more  than  sufficient,  to  meet  all 
possible  demands  which  will  be  made  upon  the  Committee  for  copies 
of  the  record  of  the  Baltimore  Convention.  I  don't  know  what  the  ex- 
perience of  other  Committeemen  is;  I  have  been  here  a  long  time,  but 
not  many  people  bought  those  records,  and  few  ever  read  them,  if  yon 
send  them  to  them.  Five  thousand  copies,  I  think,  wtmld  be  ample  to 
n:e't  nil  possible  demands. 

WOODSON:  T  just  want  tu  inform  Gov.  Ellyson  that  my  experience 

!  •.•''a  that   \\i&lt;  !i:uv  ueiirn.lly  run  short  in  the  last  ten  years,  when  we 

had  even  ten  thousand  printed.     Every  delegate,  alternate,  member  of 

.     a,  newspaper  and  magazine  editor  wants  a  copy.     Every  library 


APPENDIX  513 

in  the  United.  States  is  constantly  calling  for  these  records.  There  is 
hardly  a  day  that  I  do  not  get  additional  calls  for  them,  and  the  last 
supply  was  exhausted  a  year  or  eighteen  months  ago. 

MR.  KING  :  Mr.  Chairman,  it  occurs  to  me  this  Convention  will 
create  an  unusual  demand  for  the  record,  more  so  than  any  previous 
Convention.  It  is  generally  conceded  as  one  of  the  greatest  Conven- 
tions the  country  has  ever  had.  I  think  I  have  promised  about  fifty  in  my 
State  to  see  that  they  got  a  copy  if  it  is  possible  for  me  to  do  so,  and 
we  have  only  ten  delegates  from  Washington.  At  the  same  ratio,  it 
seems  to  me  in  place  of  reducing  the  number  you  should  increase  it  about 
five  thousand. 

The  question  on  the  resolution  offered  by  Mr.  Boeschenstein  was  put 
by  the  Chairman  and  unanimously  carried. 

MR.  KING:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  now  move  that  the  Chairman  of  this 
Committee  be  empowered  to  arrange  for  headquarters. 

A  VOICE:  Oh,  that  is  settled. 

MR.  KING:   No,  it  is  not.     He  has  not  been  given  the  power  at  all. 

SENATOR  GORE:    It  is  in   the  resolution. 

MR.  KING:  No.  it  is  not  in  the  resolution.  The  Executive  Committee 
has  the  power,  but  he  has  not ;  the  Chairman  hasn  't  the  right.  Now,  it 
he  waits  until  this  Executive  Committee  is  appointed  we  will  loose  pos- 
sibly a  week  or  ten  days.  Now,  the  appointment  of  this  Committee  is 
not  an  easy  one.  The  men  that  he  will  want,  or  that  the  Governor  will 
want,  they  can't  always  get,  and  it  takes  time  to  do  it.  I  think  we 
should  at  once  open  headquarters,  and  it  is  a  mistake  unless  he  has 
got  the  power.  I  therefore  move  that  the  Chairman  of  this  Committee  be 
empowered  to  arrange  for  headquarters  at  his  early  convenience. 

MR.    TAGGART:    I   second   the   motion. 

The  motion  was  put  by  the  Chairman  and  unanimously  carried. 

SENATOR  GORE:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  send  to  the  desk  a  resolution  which 
I  ask  to  have  read,  and,  if  former  National  Chairmen  Mack  and  Taggart 
think  there  is  no  impropriety  in  it,  I  shall  move  its  adoption. 

Thereupon  the  Secretary  read  the  following  resolution : 

"Be  it  Eesolved,  By  the  Democratic  National  Committee,  that  we 
congratulate  the  country  and  the  Democracy  upon  the  exceptional  pros- 
pects of  Democratic  success  in  November  next.  We  rejoice  that  all 
Democrats  everywhere  are  united  and  enthusiastic  in  support  of  the 
platform  and  nominees  of  the  party.  We  earnestly  invite  all  voters, 
without  reference  to  previous  political  faith  or  affiliation,  who  are  in 
sympathy  with  such  platforms  and  nominees,  to  unite  permanently 
or  co-operate  temporarily  with  the  Democratic  party  in  this  supreme 
struggle  for  the  establishment  of  justice  and  equal  rights  as  against 
favoritism  and  privilege. 

"Eesolved,  That  we  gratefully  acknowledge  our  profound  appre 
ciation  of  the  courageous,  disinterested  and  patriotic  course  of  many 
Kepublicans  and  Independents,  including  a  number  of  the  most  dis- 


514  APPENDIX 

tinguished  leaders  and  editors,  in  declaring  their  intention  to  support 
the  Democratic  ticket  in  the  pending  Presidential  contest."  . 

MR.  MACK:    I  am  very  much  for  it. 

SENATOR  GORE:   And  Mr.  Taggart? 

MR.  TAGGART:   So  am  I. 

SENATER  GORE:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  move  the  adoption  of  the  resolution. 

MR.  MACK:     I  second  the  motion. 

The  motion  was  put  by  the  Chairman  and  unanimously  carried. 

MR.  SAULSBURY:  Mr.  Chairman,  there  is  a  gentleman  here  who 
has  resided  in  my  State  for  a  good  many  years,  and  he  desires  to 
address  the  Committee  on  the  subject  of  the  Aldrich  Currency  Bill,  lie 
thinks  it  a  matter  of  very  great  importance  at  this  time. 

(Cries  of  "No,  no.") 

MR.  LYNCH  :  I  think  I  can  raise  a  point  of  order  on  that.  We 
are  in  executive  session. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :     I  rule  the  point  is  well  taken. 

MR.  McGRAW:  I  submitted  a  motion  to  the  committee,  which  seems 
to  have  been  lost  in  this  general  discussion,  and  that  was  that  the 
Secretary  of  this  Committee  be  authorized  and  permitted,  with  the 
concurrence  and  assent  and  association  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Com- 
mittee, pending  the  appointment  of  the  sub-committee,  to  appoint  his 
own  a&amp;s'stants  and  associate  secretaries.  While  I  am  on  my  feet,  I 
hope  the  Chair  will  indulge  me  a  minute.  I  think  the  statement  coming 
from  the  experienced  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  the  one  who -is  just 
retiring,  and  the  one  who  preceded  him,  shows  that  there  should  be 
activity  on  the  part  of  the  Secretary  of  this  Committee  in  connection 
with  the  printing  and  the  other  work  of  the  Committee,  and  all  that 
cannot  be  done  by  the  Secretary  himself  and  await  the  action  of  the 
Chairman  in  appointing  the  sub-committee  or  the  campaign  committee 
that  may  hereafter  be  appointed.  I  want  to  invite  the  attention  of  the 
chair  to  my  motion  and  renew  it,  which  is,  that  the  Secretary,  in  con- 
junction witli  the  Chairman  of  this  Committee,  be  authorized  and  em- 
powered to  appoint  his  associate  secretaries  and  assistants. 

THE   CHAIRMAN:     You  have  heard  the  motion.     Ts   there  a  second? 

MR.  MACK:  You  mean,  of  course,  with  the  approval  of  the  Chair- 
iii.-ut  .' 

MR.  McGRAW :     Certainly. 

MR.  MACK:  I  think  that  is  a  very  proper  resolution.  I  second  the 
unit  ion. 

The  motion  w;is  put  by  the  Chairman  and  unanimously  carried. 

MR.  COSTELLO:  Mr.  Chairman,  1  have  a  matter  that  won't  take  a 
moment's  time. 

Thereupon    the    Secretary    read    the    following-  resolution: 

"Resolved,  that  the  Democratic  Central  Committee  of  the  District 
of  Columbia,  of  \\hi.-h  Mr.  Eobert  F.  Mattingly  is  now  Chairman,  and 
Mr.  John  B,  ('oljioys  is  now  Secretary,  be,  and  the  same  is  hereby 


APPENDIX  515 

recognized  as  the  regularly  elected  and  duly  constituted  Democratic 
Central  Committee  of  the  District  of  Columbia." 

ME.  BOESCHENSTEIK  :  I  move  the  resolution  be  referred  to  the 
Executive  Committee. 

The  motion  was  put  to  vote  by  the  Chairman  and  unanimously 
carried. 

MR.  BOESCHEXSTEIN:     Mr.  Chairman,  I  now  move  we  adjourn. 

There  were  several  objections,  and  a  motion  to  take  a  recess  until 
4  o  'clock. 

MR.  WOOD:  Mr.  Chairman,  we  have  our  officers,  and  we  will  have  our 
Executive  Committee.  Now,  it  seems  to  me  that  during  this  interim,  it 
won 't  be  but  a  few  days— I  think  they  are  hair  trigger  propositions — 
they  will  do  their  part  and  we  will  go  home  and  do  ours.  I  don't  see 
any  reason  why  we  should  meet  again  or  come  back  at  4  o'clock.  Some 
of  us  want  to  take  trains  and  go  home.  It  seems  to  me  we  ought  to  go 
home,  get  into  co-operation  with  our  chairmen  of  the  State  Central 
Committees  and  get  up  ratification  meetings  and  get  busy  awful  quick. 
I  will  tell  you  why,  because  this  Eoosevelt  proposition  is  disintegrating 
in  some  places  and  it  is  just  a  question  now  where  we  put  into  it  vim 
and  ginger.  I  think  as  far  as  the  printing  is  concerned,  it  is  a  little 
thing,  but  the  quickest  you  can  get  these  lithographs  out  all  through  this 
country — men  are  asking  for  them,  Kepublicans  are  asking  for  them, 
Republican  farmers  are  asking  for  them.  Let's  go  back  home  and  get 
up  ratification  meetings  and  get  busy  in  the  next  three  or  four  weeks, 
and  not  wait  until  this  committee  is  thoroughly  organized.  Let's  get 
our  work  started,  and  when  you  are  ready,  we  are  ready  to  co-operate. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  I  think,  Mr.  Wood,  a  motion  might  well  be  enter- 
tained here  that  this  committee  seek — the  members  of  the  committee  seek 
in  their  states — to  have  immediate  ratification  meetings.  I  think  it  is 
most  important. 

MR.  WOOD:  Mr.  Chairman,  T  make  that  motion,  that  the  National 
Committee  representatives  see  the  ratification  meetings,  general  ratifica- 
tion meetings  be  held  in  each  state  at  the  earliest  possible  moment. 

The  motion  was  seconded. 

MR.  MACK:    Not  each  state,  ea«h  county. 

MR.  WOOD:    County  and  city — yes,  each  county. 

The  motion  was  put  by  the  chairman  and  unanimously  carried. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    Any  further  business? 

MK.  McGRAW:  I  desire  very  briefly  to  invite  the  attention  of  the 
committee,  with  the  dissolution  of  the  old  committee  and  the  inaugura- 
tion of  the  new,  to  a  suggestion  which  I  subsequently  will  present  in  the 
nature  of  a  motion,  if  it  be  the  consensus  of  opinion  of  the  memberg 
here  that  it  should  be  done,  and  that  is  that  there  should  be  some  testi- 
monial presented  to  Colonel  Robert  Grain,  of  the  city  of  Baltimore,  for 
the  interest  manifested  by  him  in  the  convention,  the  great  interest  he 
took  in  it  and  the  manner  in  which  he  handled  the  matter. 


516  APPENDIX 

MR.  WOODSON:    There  was  a  resolution  by  the  convention. 

MB.  McGRAw:  We  want  something  further  than  that.  That  was  a 
resolution  of  thanks.  It  is  well  known  that  Mr.  Grain  raised  $100,000, 
which  he  deposited  to  the  credit  of  the  Chairman  of  this  Committee.  It 
is  further  known  by  the  Committee  on  Arrangements  that  every  sug- 
gestion made  by  that  committee  was  acceded  to  by  Mr.  Grain,  and  addi- 
tional funds  raised.  He  gave  a  year  of  his  time  and  his  attention  to  the 
convention,  and  carried  out,  in  conjunction  with  the  honorable  member 
from  the  State  of  Maryland  of  this  committee,  the  greatest  convex 
tion  ever  held  in  North  America.  I  think,  while  the  committee  is  in  ses* 
sion,  and  the  old  committee,  many  of  them,  are  here,  that  it  is  proper 
that  some  testimonial  of  some  character  should  be  taken  into  considera- 
tion, and  that  a  proper  committee  appointed  by  this  committee  should 
take  into  consideration  what  form  it  should  take,  and  that  the  neces- 
sary funds  be  raised  for  presenting  him  some  testimonial  for  the  kind- 
ness extended  to  the  members  of  the  committee  and  the  great  service 
he  rendered  to  the  Democratic  party  in  that  which  was  the  greatest  con- 
vention in  the  history  of  this  country.  Now  I  will  make  that  as  a 
motion,  and  I  fortify  that  with  the  further  fact  that  the  Honorable 
Norman  E.  Mack  shall  be  the  chairman  of  that  committee. 

MR.  SAPP:    Mr.  Chairman,  I  second  the  motion. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Does  your  motion  include  any  particular  member- 
ship in  number  of  that  committee? 

MR.  McGRAW :    Make  it  three  or  five — a  committee  of  five. 

SENATOR  GORE:    What. was  the  motion! 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  That  a  committee  be  appointed  to  propose  and  con- 
struct a  suitable  testimonial  to  Mr.  Eobert  Grain,  of  Baltimore,  for  his 
excellent  management  in  connection  with  the  convention  and  prior 
thereto.  Is  there  a  second  to  that  motion? 

SENATOR  GORE:    I  second  the  motion. 

The  motion  was  put  by  the  Chairman  and  unanimously  carried. 

MR.  BOESCHENSTEIN:  I  now  renew  my  motion.  I  now  move  that 
we  adjourn. 

MR.  KING:  I  move  you  to  amend  the  motion  by  making  it  read  that 
when  we  adjourn,  we  adjourn  to  rrfeet  again  at  4  o'clock,  at  5  o'clock.  I 
think  there  are  many  things  that  come  up  that  occur  to  us  after  adjourn- 
ment, and  if  we  meet  at  5  o'clock  it  will  not  take  us  long  to  adjourn. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    Do  you  accept  the  substitute,  Mr.  Boeschenstein ? 

MR.  BOESCHENSTEIN  :  Mr.  Chairman,  I  have  no  doubt  many  of '  us 
could  think  of  several  things  we  would  like  to  talk  over  after  4  o'clock, 
but  I  think  those  matters  might  as  well  be  left  to  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee. I  see  no  reason  why  we  should  take  a  recess.  I  think  the  main 
Itrsinoss  of  this  body  is  finished,  nnd  the  matters  that  have  not  been  con- 
sidered by  this  meeting  in;iy  IK-  sntVly  referred  to  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee. 

MR.  MACK:    I  trust  this  committee  will  finish  its  work.     A  number 


APPENDIX  517 

of  us  have  been  away  from  borne  for  jveeks,  and  we  are  all  anxious  to 
finish  here  today.  I  am  willing  to  stay  for  two  hours  now  and  go 
on  with  the  work  of  this  committee  if  there  is  anything  to  be  done. 

THE  (  HAIRMAN  :  The  chair  will  ask  as  to  whether  there  is  anything 
further  any  member  of  the  committee  wishes  to  consider  in  the  meet- 
ing here? 

MR.  BROWNE:  1  just  wish  to  suggest  to  the  gentlemen  that  the  other 
States  do  not  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  so  much  as  the  State 
of  Vermont  in  the  organization  of  the  special  committee.  The  other 
States  don't  vote  until  November,  but  the  only  election  that  will  be 
held  in  the  State  of  Vermont  in  which  this  committee  will  have  any 
interest  whatever  will  be  held  on  the  third  day  of  September,  some  few 
months  prior  to  the  holding  of  any  other  election,  except  that  of  the 
State  of  Maine,  which  follows  about  a  week  later.  So  you  can  see  it 
is  very  important  to  us  that  the  Executive  Committee  be  formed  almost 
immediately  and  that  headquarters  be  established  so  that  our  literature 
may  be  secured  and  that  we  may  be  in  shape  to  receive  such  assistance 
from  the  new  committee  as  we  may  have  reason  to  expect.  And  for 
that  reason  I  hope  that  the  Chairman  will  not  delay  in  the  selection  of 
the  committee,  but  that  it  may  be  done  immediately,  in  order  that  we 
may  have  an  opportunity  to  confer  with  them  and  have  the  assistance 
that  we  think  will  be  necessary  in  the  State  of  Vermont  on  the  first 
Tuesday  in  September. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  chair  will  expedite  that  matter  as  much  as  pos- 
sible, and  hopes  it  will  be  concluded  within  two  or  three  days. 

MR.  BOESCHENSTEIN:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  desire  to  renew  my  motion 
that  the  committee  now  adjourn,  subject  to  the  call  of  the  Chairman. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  Before  I  put  that  motion,  I  desire  to  announce 
the  committee  on  the  testimonial  to  Mr.  Grain.  In  addition  to  Mr. 
Mack,  Colonel  McGraw,  Mr.  Taggart,  Mr.  Sullivan  and  Judge  Wade. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :    A  motion  to  adjourn  is  in  order. 

THE  SECRETARY:  Mr.  Chairman,  before  you  adjourn  I  would  like  to 
say  just  one  word  along  the  lines  of  practical  organization.  The  State 
Central  Committees  are  largely  going  to  be  changed  within  the  next 
four  or  five  weeks,  due  to  the  fact  that  these  primary  elections  are  tak- 
ing place,  and  they  change  the  personnel  of  the  State  organizations. 
There  is  that  particular  line  of  organization  that  can  be  effected,  in 
my  judgment,  immediately,  and  it  is  to  that  proposition  I  desire  to  call 
the  attention  of  National  Committeemen  here,  and  that  is  this — that  the 
public  mind  is  in  a  state  of  more  or  less  chaos  now,  and  we  can  do 
better  and  more  effective  missionary  work  now  among  the  young  voters 
and  those  who  are  beginning  to  take  another  position  than  we  could 
later.  The  organization  is  such  we  cannot  get  effective  work  for  at 
least  two  weeks,  but  there  is  one  line  of  work  we  can  do,  and  which  we 
have  already  started  doiiiij  in  our  State  of  Wisconsin,  and  I  desire  to 
submit  it  to  you  gentlemen  for  your  consideration  when  you  go  to  your 


518  APPENDIX 

various  States,  and  it  is  this — one  *f  the  best  means  of  exciting  interest- 
and  getting  recruits  and  proselyting,  is  the  organization  of  Wilson  and 
Marshall  clubs.  That  can  be  done  without  in  any  manner  encroaching 
upon  the  National  organization,  and  will  be  furthering  the  National 
organization,  and  will  be  sowing  the  'seed  early.  It  can  be  done  by  the 
National  committeemen  giving  some  time  to  the  matter  with  their  State 
chairmen  and  their  State  organization,  and  getting  some  live  member, 
whether  he  be  a  county  chairman  or  whether  he  be  some  other  man,  in 
every  county  seat,  to  start  that  and  to  start  it  immediately.  And  it 
seems  to  me  that  the  next  two  weeks  can  be  utilized  to  great  advantage 
by  the  National  committeemen  starting  that  movement  in  their  own 
States  as  soon  as  they  get  back.  It  can  be  co-ordinated  later  with  the 
organization  of  the  National  Woodrow  Wilson  Clubs,  through  the 
National  organization. 

(Cries  of  "Question!") 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Before  that  motion  is  put,  I  would  like  to  call  the 
attention  of  this  committee  to  one  matter.  I  want  to  talk  about  the 
money  question.  We  are  starting  on  a  campaign,  as  the  committee 
always  does,  broke — practically  broke.  You  haven't  got  a  cent.  The 
first  thing  you  will  be  called  upon  to  do  will  be  to  order  in  the  neighbor- 
hood of  two  hundred  or  two  hundred  and  fifty  thousand  dollars'  worth 
of  printing  of  one  kind  or  another.  This  committee  will  have  to  raise 
in  the  neighborhood  of  at  least  a  million  dollars  for  this  campaign,  and 
every  member  of  this  committee,  representing  every  State  in  the  Union, 
is  expected  and  delegated  to  devise  some  ways  and  means  of  getting 
some  money  in  their  respective  States  for  the  national  campaign.  There 
are  over  forty  members  of  this  committee  here  today.  The  chances  are 
there  will  not  be  forty  members  of  this  committee  at  any  other  meet- 
ing during  this  campaign.  It  is  just  as  well  to  call  their  attention  to  the 
fact  that  they  must  and  should  pay  some  little  attention  to  that. 
Undoubted!)'  there  will  be  a  finance  committee  appointed,  and  men 
will  go  out  in  a  general  way  and  collect  such  funds  as  they  can,  but 
every  State  can  furnish  some  money  to  defray  these  expenses.  And  I 
don't  know  but  what  it  is  due  time  to  at  least  call  the  attention  of  the 
members  of  this  committee  to  the  fact  that  this  is  a  very  important  mat- 
ter, because  if  you  don't  get  some  money  there  are  many  of  these  other 
things  you  will  be  contemplating  and  endeavoring  to  do,  and  saying  you 
ought  to  do,  that  won't  be  done.  I  merely  want  to  call  the  attention 
«f  the  National  Committee  to  that  before  you  adjourn. 

THK  SECKKTARY:  I  would  like  to  suggest  along  that  line  that  one 
of  the  best  means,  or  at  least  a  very  fertile  means  of  raising  money  is 
through  the  Democratic  press.  I  understand  Chairman  Mack's  paper, 
which  started  out  in  the  campaign  last  Saturday,  raied  a  thousand  dol- 
lars through  popular  subscriptions  in  a  very  short  time. 

Mi;.  MACK:    In  two  minutes. 


APPENDIX  519 

THE  SECRETARY:  That  can  be  done  in  other  States,  and  I  simply 
offer  that  as  a  suggestion. 

MR.  MACK:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  intended  talking  to  you  this  morning 
about  that  matter,  but  I  didn't  have  a  chance;  I  could  not  get  at  you; 
you  wore  busy  with  other  work.  I  was  going  to  ask  you  as  to  the  advisa- 
bility of  taking  the  matter  up  with  the  committee  today — that  is,  that 
particular  phase  of  it,  the  raising  of  money  by  newspapers,  and  I  had 
this  in  mind,  as  Mr.  Sullivan  very  properly  said.  We  have  got  forty 
members  of  the  committee  here  today,  and  probably  we  will  not  meet 
a^ain  with  that  many  present  until  possibly  four  years  from  now,  unless 
some  extraordinary  condition  may  arise.  Now.  in  raising  money  four 
years  ago,  the  cheap  money  that  we  got  came  through  the  newspapers. 
Other  moneys  that  were  received  was  expensive  in  securing  it — that  is,  by 
solicitors  and  by  literature  and  all  that  sort  of  thing;  it  was  quite 
expensive,  except  the  newspaper  collections,  which,  of  course,  did  not 
cost  anything.  The  money  that  the  New  Orleans  States  raised,  for 
instance  (Major  Swing's  paper),  did  not  ccst  a  cent;  the  money  my 
paper  raised  did  not  cost  a  cent;  the  money  the  Memphis  Commercial- 
Appeal  raised  did  not  cost  a  cent;  the  money  hundreds  of  little  news- 
papers raised  did  not  cost  a  cent,  except  the  postage  in  asking  them  to 
start  the  campaign.  Now  no  circular  or  letter  will  be  so  effective  in  get- 
ting these  newspapers  to  work  as  the  members  of  this  committee  can  do 
in  the  way  of  suggesting  and  asking  them  to  do  it  at  home.  For 
instance,  the  forty  members  of  the  committee  can  each  reach  a  hundred 
newspapers  direct.  So  now  go  at  this  thing  and  do  it.  Last  Saturday 
night  I  went  down  to  the  office  late,  and  I  had  one  of  my  men  call  up 
ten  men  and  asked  them  to  contribute  one  hundred  dollars  just  to  start 
the  thing,  and  they  all  joined,  every  one  of  them — none  of  them  refused. 
So  we  started  a  campaign  fund  of  that  kind  and  had  a  thousand  dollars 
in  two  minutes.  Four  years  ago.  I  don't  know  how  much  we  raised, 
but  out  of  the  six  hundred  thousand  dollars  that  was  raised,  two  hundred 
and  fifty  thousand  of  it  came  from  the  newspapers  at  a  very  nominal 
cost.  The  other  money  that  we  received  cost  a  great  deal  to  get,  and  I 
think  it  would  be  a  very  good  thing  if  the  Chairman  of  this  committee, 
if  it  is  in  order,  and  unless  it  is  too  early — rand  I  don't  think  it  is,  because 
as  Mr.  Sullivan  just  said,  you  need  money  for  all  sorts  of  things,  and 
you  won't  have  much  to  start  with — I  think  it  would  be  a  very  good 
thing  if  this  committee  would  take  hold  of  the  newspaper  end  of  the 
campaign  now  and  get  it  going.  I  merely  suggest  that  to  you,  Mr. 
Chairman,  to  make  any  suggestion  you  please  about  it. 

MR.  KING:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  want  to  say  a  word  or  two  along  this 
line.  I  think  the  discussion  of  the  last  fifteen  minutes  has  been  one  of 
the  most  valuable  discussions  we  have  had,  notwithstanding  there  has 
been  a  unanimous  desire  to  adjourn,  for  the  reason  that  there  was 
nothing  further  to  discuss.  I  am  still  of  the  opinion  we  would  profit 
by  discussion  along  these  lines  and  other  liiifs.  For  example,  we  have 


520  APPENDIX 

twenty-four  new  members  of  the  committee  here.  I  think  a  great  deal  of 
time  can  be  valuably  consumed  by  the  old  members  of  the  committee,  at 
the  proper  time,  discussing  the  methods  of  campaign  in  each  State, 
what  the  relationship  of  the  National  committeeman  is  to  the  State 
committee,  and  give  them  the  benefit  of  their  experience  and  their  ideas, 
so  when  we  go  home  we  will  have  the  advantage  of  their  experience. 
And  for  that  reason  I  am  still  of  the  opinion  it  is  a  mistake  to  adjourn 
and  dissolve  at  this  time.  I  think  we  should  have  a  further  meeting  and 
discuss  these  matters.  I  am  further  away  from  home  perhaps  than 
any  man  here,  something  like  twenty-five  hundred  miles,  and  having 
waited  this  long  to  attend  this  committee,  I  am  certainly  willing  to  wait 
two  or  three  hours  longer  for  any  further  discussion  that  may  arise  in 
the  committee.  If  some  desire  to  take  trains  and  get  home,  of  course 
we  are  sorry  to  lose  them,  but  there  will  be  others  here  who  can  talk 
the  matter  over  to  mutual  advantage  to  all. 

MR.  LYNCH:  I  move  that  the  Chair  appoint  a  committee  of  three, 
with  Mr.  Sullivan,  of  Alaska,  as  Chairman,  to  prepare  and  present  to 
the  retiring  officers,  the  Chairman  and  Secretary,  Mr.  Mack  and  Mr. 
Woodson,  a  testimonial  of  regard  from  the  National  Committee.  I  offer 
the  resolution. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:    Mr.  Sullivan,  of  Illinois? 

MR.  LYNCH:    He  has  a  proxy  from  Alaska. 

THE  CHAIRMAN  :    You  have  heard  the  motion.     Is  there  a  second  ? 

MR.  EWING:    I  second  the  motion. 

The  motion  was  put  by  the  Chairman  and  unanimously  carried. 

THE  CHAIRMAN:  The  Chair  appoints  on  the  committee  just  author- 
ized Mr.  Sullivan,  of  Alaska,  Mr.  Lynch  and  Mr.  Talbott. 

MR.  LING:  Mr.  Chairman,  as  a  representative  of  the  youngest  State 
in  the  Union,  I  desire  to  read  the  following  telegram,  which  was  just 
handed  me: 

"Headquarters  opened  here  today  by  Democratic  State  Committee, 
ami  active  campaign  in  Arizona  on  behalf  of  Wilson  and  Marshall  has 
begun  and  will  be  continued  throughout  the  campaign.  The  first  Presi- 
dential vote  of  this  State  will  be  cast  overwhelmingly  for  the  Baltimore 
nominees."  Signed  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Arizona  Committee. 

(Applause.) 

MR.  DANIELS:  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  we  could  profitably  devote  an 
hour  this  afternoon  to  the  discussion  of  practical  matters  and  financing 
this  campaign.  There  are  twenty-four  new  members  here,  as  Mr.  King 
has  said,  and  I  think  the  old  members  would  like  to  hear  from  them 
and  get  new  ideas;  and  I  move  you,  sir,  as  a  substitute  for  the  motion 
to  adjourn,  that  this  meeting  adjourn  until  5  o'clock. 

The  motion  was  duly  seconded. 

The  motion  was  put  by  the  Chairman  and  unanimously  carried. 

Recess  until  5  o  'clock.
