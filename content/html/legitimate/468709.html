PREFACE, 

The present edition is substantially the same as the first, but a 
few slight alterations have been made in consequence of sugges- 
tions made by reviewers and friends. The authorities which I 
have consulted may be ascertained by the references given in 
the notes. The names of pamphlets in the British Museum 
Library are followed by the letters or numbers signifying the 
press mark. Of the inner life of the House of Commons we 
unfortunately know less during the Civil War than during the 
first year and a half of the Long Parliament. D'Ewes, dis- 
satisfied with the course of events, grows much more reticent 
than he had formerly been, and two other diaries, those of 
Whitacre and Yonge, which I have used, I believe, for the 
first time, do not fully supply his place. Whitacre reports no 
speeches, and Yonge does so only occasionally. As Yonge 
wrote chiefly in symbols — particular marks being employed to 
represent all the commoner words — it requires a certain amount 
of preparation to read him, though, as an explanation of these 
symbols is prefixed to each of his four volumes, there is no real 
diflSculty in the matter. 

It is fortunate that since the publication of Warburton's 
' Memoirs of Rupert and the Cavaliers^ a considerable part of 
the MSS. which he used has been acquired by the Museum 
Library, not merely because there are letters in the collection 
of which he made no use, but because he neglected to take the 
trouble to read ciphered letters, even when the materials for 
doing so were to be found at the distance of a few pages. It 
will be seen that a part of a despatch of Digby's, written on the 



vl PREFACE. 

morning of the second battle of Newbury, yields interesting 
information of which no word appears in Warburton's tran- 
script, though it must be acknowledged that he did not fail to 
indicate the fact that he had not printed the whole letter. Mr. 
C. H. Firth has also been kind enough to lend me his volumes 
of transcripts of Rupert's correspondence, containing many 
letters of which the originals cannot at present be found. The 
collection of the books of the Committee of Both Kingdoms 
in the Record Office is too well known to require special re- 
cognition. Unfortunately only two volumes of the letters 
received by the Committee — in many respects the most im- 
portant of the series — have been preserved. Even better 
known than these are the Thomason Tracts in the Museum 
Library, that unequalled collection of pamphlets and news- 
papers which makes a residence in or near London absolutely 
essential to any historian of the Civil War ; whilst frequent 
visits to Oxford are rendered necessary by the existence of 
the Carte MSS. in the Bodleian Library, in which so much of 
Irish history lies concealed, and of the Tanner and Clarendon 
collections, in the latter of which are to be found increasingly 
as the war draws to a close the materials for setting forth the 
policy of the Royalist party. 

Of the value of newspapers as a subsidiary source of 
knowledge, much of a very divergent character has been said. 
Mercurius Aulicus, the Oxford organ, remains untrustworthy to 
the end. Birkenhead, its writer, composes his attacks on the 
enemy under no sense of responsibility, and with the sole end 
of making Puritans and Parliamentarians ridiculous, though 
even in his work are sometimes included reports or despatches 
of Royalist commanders which add something to our know- 
ledge. The Parliamentary newspapers begin hardly better. 
For some time they invent freely ; but either on account of the 
character of the readers for whom they catered, or on account 
of the competition to which they were subjected — fifteen or 
twenty weekly newspapers being published in London for one 
at Oxford — they mend their ways before many months are past 



PREFACE. vii 

A reader has, no doubt, to be on his guard against stories of 
Cavalier outrages, especially upon women, which are probably 
for the rhost part as imaginary as are, I hope, the stories which 
were told in Ireland of both sides as habitually carrying babies 
on the ends of pikes ; but when this sort of thing is set aside 
as a common formula, there remains to the credit of the 
London newspapers an evident wish to ascertain the facts, and 
a constant habit of warning readers not to accept as certain 
news which has just come to hand. 

No one who writes about Montrose's campaigns will under- 
estimate the value of Napier's Memorials and Memoirs of 
Montrose. His industry has made it almost impossible to 
discover any facts unnoticed by him. It is only in his descrip- 
tion of battles that one hesitates to follow him, as there are no 
signs of his having visited the localities, and it is certain that 
Wishart and probable that Patrick Gordon, the authors on whom 
he mainly relies, did not. Wishart especially is sometimes be 
trayed into palpable error by his topographical ignorance, and 
the knowledge that this is the case has made me doubt 
whether I have arrived at anything like accuracy when I have 
had to build on his evidence, even when I have been able to 
correct it by the use of my own eyes. 

In my inquiries on the spot into the topography of 
Montrose's six great victories, I have had much valuable local 
assistance, and I feel bound to express my hearty thanks to 
those whose knowledge of the ground proved helpful — to Mr. 
George Bain, the editor of the Nairnshire Telegraph, who con- 
ducted me over the field of Auldearn ; to Mr. R. F. O. 
Farquharson, of Hoghton, on whose property is the site of the 
battle of Alford ; to the Rev. Dr. Milne, of Fyvie, for his expla- 
nation of Montrose's position at Fyvie Castle ; and to Mr 
A. M. Munro, of the City Chamberlain's office at Aberdeen, with- 
out whose antiquarian knowledge of the locality in which the 
battle of Aberdeen was fought 1 should have been entirely at 
fault, as the ground is now covered with streets. 

I have also to thank the Earl of Leicester for his kindness 



viii PREFACE. 

in allowing his copy oi Einuccini's Memoirs to lie at the British 
Museum for some time, thereby enabling me to use them in a 
leisurely fashion. These Memoirs were compiled by a priest 
from Rinuccini's papers after his death, and afford a good deal 
of information not to be found in the despatches printed in the 
Nunziatura, and contains a considerable number of unpublished 
documents. A description of the MS. is given by Mr. J. T. 
Gilbert in the Ninth Report of the Historical MSS. Commis- 
sion, Appendix II., page 340. Mr. Gilbert has also printed in 
his History of the Irish Confederation, and his Contemporary 
History of Affairs in Ireland, a large amount of hitherto unused 
material. 

Of the papers at Kingston Lacy, which Mr. Bankes was 
good enough to allow me to examine, the most important is the 
book of the Parliamentary Committee for Dorset, and some 
letters from Digby to Jermyn, which are shown by the marks 
on them to have belonged originally to the papers taken from 
Digby at Sherburn, most of which are in the Record Office. 

No writer of the history of the Civil War can avoid the 
difficult task of forming a judgment on the character and aims 
of Cromwell. If this is to be done with even an approximation 
to success, it is absolutely necessary to take Carlyle's monu- 
mental work as a starting point. Every satisfactory effort to 
understand the character of a man must be based on his own 
spoken and written words, though it is always possible to throw 
in further light and shade from other sources. 

To one seeking further knowledge two lines of inquiry pre- 
sent themselves — first, the examination of new evidence, and 
secondly the critical sifting of evidence which has long been 
before the world. With respect to the material falling under 
the first head, pre-eminent importance belongs to The Clarke 
Papers, of which the first volume has recently been edited by my 
friend, Mr. C. H. Firth, for the Camden Society. Mr. Firth has 
obligingly lent me the copies which he had made for a second 
volume, which will probably appear at no distant date. These 
copies have been quoted by me as Clarke MSS. to distinguish 



PREFACE. n 

them from the printed volume. A third set of papers, bound in 
a folio volume, contain notes of the trials of Hamilton, Capel, 
and others involved in the second civil war, and have been 
quoted by me as Clarke Trials. I desire to express my obliga- 
tions to the authorities of Worcester College, in whose posses- 
sion the originals are, for permission to make use of this latter 
MS., which is still uncopied. Unfortunately, the reports of the 
trials were so badly taken as to be in many places unintelligible, 
but a good deal of matter of considerable interest may never- 
theless be extracted from them. Taken altogether, these 
Clarke Papers bring strongly out the conservative and hesita- 
ting side of Cromwell's character, whilst they also bring us, as 
we have never been brought before, into the very heart of that 
army, in the midst of which Cromwell lived and moved, and 
enable us to trace the movements of political thought which 
afterwards developed themselves in the constitutional experi- 
ments of the Commonwealth. 

Mr. Firth's discovery of the Clarke Papers throws every 
other accession of material into the shade, but valuable infor- 
mation is to be gained from the despatches of the French 
ambassadors and agents. Many of them have been copied 
from our Record Office. Montreuil's letters to Mazarin, how- 
ever, are still only to be found in the Archives of the French 
Foreign Office. Another valuable source of information is con- 
tained in copies lately sent from Rome to the Public Record 
Office under the title of ' Newsletters,' and quoted by me as 
the Roman Newsletters. This title, however, fails to convey a 
true idea of their value. The writer was, as appears from 
internal evidence, a Tuscan priest residing in England, who, in 
the summer of 1647 was employed by Bellifevre to convey mes- 
sages between him and the army leaders, and who therefore 
speaks, especially during the time of his employment, with an 
authority not usually enjoyed by a writer of newsletters. 

In the second place arises the necessity of criticising the 
often-quoted pamphlets written at the time by Cromwell's 
enemies, which present a consensus of opinion to the last degree 



X PREFACE. 

unfavourable to his uprightness of character. Subjecting these 
writings to the first rule of criticism, a large number of them 
may be peremptorily set aside, either as merely containing vague 
charges, or as produced by men who had no means whatever 
of knowing the truth. It would be sheer partisanship to treat 
in the same way the accusations brought by men of trans- 
parent honesty such as Lilburne and Wildman, both of whom 
had considerable means of becoming acquainted with the 
external facts of Cromwell's life. Yet these accusations stand 
in such startling contrast with all' that we know of Cromwell 
from his own written and spoken words that, at the first blush, 
a conscientious inquirer is fairly puzzled. 

Here, however, as in so many other knotty matters, the 
thread leading out of the maze is to be found by a strict 
adherence to chronology. It was with no little surprise that I 
found one charge after another melt away as I was able to fix 
a date to the words or actions which had given rise to hostile 
comments. Thus tested, the Cromwell of Lilburne and Wild- 
man shows himself the same man as the Cromwell of the letters 
and the Clarke Papers — no divinely inspired hero, indeed, or 
faultless monster, but a brave, honourable man, striving, 
according to his lights, to lead his countrymen into the paths 
of peace and godliness. The investigation which I have thus 
conducted is the more conclusive because, whilst it shows that 
Cromwell was not a hypocrite, it also shows that it was the 
most natural thing in the world that other men should think him 
to be one. 

An eighteenth century copy of a lost account of the siege 
of Colchester, which is quoted as ' Mr. Round's MS.,' was lent 
me by Mr. James Round, whose cousin, Mr. J. H. Round 
kindly accompanied me in my investigation of the sites con- 
nected with the siege, and placed at my disposal his store of 
local knowledge. As far as the social history of the period is 
concerned, I have been allowed by Sir Harry Verney to make 
use of the vast collection of private letters preserved at Claydon 
House. I have attempted in dealing with them to confine 



PREFACE. M 

myself for the most part to such as throw light directly oi 
indirectly on public affairs. Those of my readers who wish to 
continue their acquaintance with Sir Ralph Verney and his 
family have an opportunity of doing so in Lady Verney 's Memoirs 
of the Verney Family during the Civil War. 

Since the Hamilton Papers were published by me for the 
Camden Society I have been able again to examine, by the 
permission of Sir W. Fraser, K.C.B., who at that time had this 
valuable collection in his charge, the letters written in the early 
part of 1648 by agents of the Hamilton party. Several of these 
letters are in undeciphered cipher, and were consequently 
omitted in my volume, and they also find no place in Sir W. 
Eraser's report to the Historical Commission. On my second 
visit, however, I found that the ciphers used could be inter- 
preted with the help of deciphers interlined in other letters, and 
I was therefore enabled without much difficulty to make out 
almost every one of them. They are here quoted as Hamilton 
Papers, Addenda, and they will, I hope, be printed in the next 
volume of the Camden Society's Miscellany. 

I ought to say a few words about the maps inserted in these 
volumes. Of the coloured maps, those which give the relative 
positions of the two English parties at certain dates have been 
constructed with the help of contemporary newspapers and 
letters. There must always, however, have been a certain 
number of private houses holding out for the King or for the 
Parliament which have escaped my researches, some of which 
indeed could hardly have been included in a map on so small 
I scale. The map of Ireland, as far as Ulster and Connaught 
are concerned, has been constructed in the same way, and is 
liable to the same drawbacks. The line separating the two 
parties in Leinster and Munster is distinctly marked in the text 
of the Treaty of Cessation, though even there fortified posts in 
possession of either party at the date of the treaty were to re- 
main in the hands of those who held them. As to the other 
two provinces, the treaty merely states that each party shall 
hold its own. Consequently, unless where a post is of sufficient 



x\i PREFACE. 

importance to be named in some contemporary letter, it would 
not come under my notice. The divisions of the clan territories 
in the map of the Highlands of Scotland are copied from those 
in the map in General Stewart's Sketches of the Highlands, but 
the colouring showing the side taken by each clan is taken from 
the statements of contemporary writers, though in one or two 
cases I have had considerable doubt about its accuracy. 

Of the smaller maps, those of battle-fields have given me 
considerable difficulty. There are in existence modern maps 
of the principal battles in which the numbers and position of 
the combatants are laid down with great minuteness. It has 
frequently happened that I have been unable to satisfy myself 
as to the accuracy of these details, and I have preferred to 
allow my maps to be less full than to fill up the gaps in my 
knowledge by conjecture. 

The two maps of the battles of Newbury are founded on 
' A Map of the County of Berks ... by the late J. Rocque,' 
in eighteen sheets, published in 1762, and therefore having 
spaces open which are now enclosed. To Mr. A. M. Munro 
I owe an indication of Milne's plan of Aberdeen, published 
from a survey taken in 1789, and therefore before modern 
buildings had sprung up, on which my plan of the battle is 
founded. The map of the siege of Bristol is taken, with some 
slight omissions, with the permission of the Rev. W. Hunt, from 
his work on Bristol in the series of ' Historic Towns.' 

I wish it were possible for me to give adequate expression 
to my sense of the obligation under which I am to Mr. Firth. 
He has generously allowed me to draw on his vast stores of 
knowledge concerning the men and things of this period, and 
has been always ready to discuss with me every point of im- 
portance as it arose, often very considerably modifying the 
opinion at which I had originally arrived.

THE GREAT CIVIL WAR. 



CHAPTER I. 

CAVALIERS AND ROUNDHEADS. 

The Civil War, the outbreak of which was announced by the 
floating of Charles's standard on the hill at Nottingham, was 
1642. rendered inevitable by the inadequacy of the mtel- 
Tte civlf" lectual methods of the day to effect a reconciliation 
War. between opposing moral and social forces which de- 

rived their strength from the past development of the nation. 
The personal characters of the leaders might do much to 
shorten or prolong the time of open warfare, but no permanent 
restoration of harmony would be possible till some compromise, 
which would give security alike to the disciples of Hooker and 
to the disciples of Calvin, had been not only thought out by 
the few, but generally accepted by the many. 

On both sides the religious difficulty was complicated by a 
political difficulty ; and, amongst the King's followers at all 
The war events, it was from those who were least under the 
^oSn'- influence of religious motives that the loudest cry for 
ham. war was heard. Men who had served in armies 

abroad, and who were familiar with the licence of camps ; 
Cavaliers who had stood by Charles on the day of baffled hopes 
when he had swooped down in vain upon the five members at 
Westminster, combined in that cry with many a gentleman of 
high temper and generous instincts, who might be indifferent 
to the character of the theology which was inculcated from the 

VOL. I, B 



Z CAVALIERS AND ROUNDHEADS. CH. I. 

pulpits, but whose moral irregularities gave him good reason to 
dread the stern pressure of Puritan austerity.' 

Such men soon discovered a leader in Charles's nephew, 
Rupert, who, with the true instinct of a soldier, had come, 
Prince bringing his younger brother, Maurice, with him, to 

Rupert. place his sword at his uncle's disposal almost at the 
moment when his elder brother, the Elector Palatine, was 
slinking away from England to avoid the necessity of malcir g a 
choice between two parties, either of which might one day be 
useful to him in supporting his pretensions in Germany. Of 
P^upert, it was truly said that he was first and last a soldier.'^ 
Coming at the age of twenty-three to that England which he 
had only seen as a visitor, it was not likely that he would 
interest himself in the deeper side of the controversy in which 
he lightly engaged. It was enough for him that he had rebels 
to contend against. Unfortunately for the cause to which he 
attached himself, he came from a land in which the soldier 
was everything and the civilian nothing. He despised courtiers 
and politicians as heartily as he despised rebels. If he wisely 
regarded as unintelligible the scruples of those who thought it 
possible to make war in a legal and constitutional way, he also, 
with less wisdom, set his face against those who thought it 
possible to bring the war to an end otherwise than by complete 
victory. 

If Rupert had been as fit to meet all the exigencies of war 
as he was to lead a charge of cavalry, it would have gone hard 
with the King's enemies. As it was, he knew how to inspire 
his followers with his own dashing energy and untiring courage ; 
but though he was as capable of planning a campaign as he 
was of conducting a charge, he was apt to lose his head in the 
heat of battle ; and to despise his enemies too much to take 
into account the full strength of their resistance. Charles at 

' At Kidderminster, to take an instance from a lower grade, Baxter 
found himself and his friends reviled by ' every drunken sot ; ' but ' when 
the wars began, almost all these drunkards v^ent into the King's army, 
and were quickly killed, so that scarce a man of thero came home agaia'

i642 TEMPER OF THE ROYALISTS. 3 

once appointed him General of the Horse. From one point 
of view no better selection could be made. There was no fear 
Rupert "°^ '•^^'- ^^^ "^oy^l cavalry would turn their backs upon 
Sc"H^L'f '•^^ enemy as, three years before, they had turned their 

backs, under Holland's command, upon the Scots at 
Kelso. From another point of view the appointment was dis- 
astrous. Rupert demanded and obtained the privilege of taking 
Lindsey Orders from the King alone.' The Earl of Lindsey, 
Commander- dcvoted to the Royalist cause, and trained in the 

severe school of the Dutch wars, had been named 
Commander-in-chief, but was now informed that the cavalry 
was not within his sphere of action. By this strange arrange- 
Conditions Hicnt, Charles repeated in the field the mistaken 
helSid^a!? tactics of his Cabinet. He wished to be himself 
command. Supreme in war as he had wished to be supreme in 
government, and, as Strafford and Laud had found to their 
cost, his only notion of the way in which supremacy was to be 
secured was never to give his entire confidence to any single 
person. 

In his joyous and abounding self-confidence, and in his 
contemptuous hatred of rebels, Rupert found himself in accord 

with a feeling which prevailed even among the more 

liers at sobcr Royalists. That rebellion was an unpardonable 

o ung am. ^.j-jjjjg^ ^^g ^ maxim which had been inculcated upon 

three generations of Englishmen. It had grown up at a time 
when almost blind obedience to the sovereign had alone gua- 
ranteed the nation — first against feudal anarchy at home, and 
afterwards against spiritual and military aggression from abroad. 
Such an opinion was certain to retain its hold upon English- 
men long after the cause which had brought it into existence 
had passed away ; and there were not a few round Charles at 
Nottingham in whose minds the political creed which they had 
received from their fathers had been rekindled by the adverse 
gusts of Puritanism. 

Of the strength of this purely Royalist feeling over coarser 
natures, something may be gathered from its hold upon men

who had nothing in common with gay riders like Rupert or 
with debauchees like Goring. Sir Edmund Verney, to whom 
Sir Edmund the King had entrusted the care of the standard, had 
Vemey. ^jggjj jj, Qharles's service from his boyhood, and had 
held the office of Knight Marshal for many years. A pure- 
minded and thoroughly religious man, his dislike of the 
Laudian practices had led both him and his eldest son, Sir 
Ralph, to vote steadily as members of the House of Commons 
in opposition to Charles's wishes. • Yet he could not endure 
to desert his master in his hour of peril. Finding his way. to 
York, he explained to Hyde the motives by which he had been 
influenced. " You,'' he said, " have satisfaction in your con- 
science that you are in the right that the King ought not to 
grant what is required of him, . . . but, for my part, I do not 
like the quarrel, and do heartily wish that the King would 
yield and consent to what they desire, so that my conscience 
is only concerned in honour and in gratitude to follow my 
master. I have eaten his bread, and served him near thirty 
years, and will not do so base a thing as to forsake him ; and 
choose rather to lose my life — which I am sure to do — to pre- 
serve and defend those things which are against my conscience 
to preserve and defend : for I will deal freely with you — I have 
no reverence for bishops, for whom this quarrel subsists." ^ 

' This appears from an allusion in a letter from Henry Vemey, one of 
Sir Edmund's younger sons, who was at this time in the Dutch army. 
Henry was told that he could not expect promotion because Wycombe 
and Aylesbury were against him. These were the boroughs for which Sir 
Edmund and his eldest son sat. The allusion would have been unintel- 
ligible unless both had voted against the Court. Another son writes thus 
to Sir Ralph, "The opinion, I see, of the great ones most at the Court is 
that my father and you are all for the Parliament, and not for the King. " 
E. Verney to Sir R. Vemey. Aug. 12. Vemey MSS. 

' Clarendon's Life, ii. 66. That the religious question was at the 
bottom of the quarrel is here plainly asserted. D'Ewes more diffusely 
says the same thing when he writes thus : — " Above all, his Majesty's infeli- 
city was that he had too vehemently and obstinately stuck to the wicked 
prelates and other like looser and corrupter sort of the clergy of this 
kingdom, who doubtless had a design, by the assistance of the Jesuits and 
the Papists here at home and in foreign parts, to have extirpated all the 
power and purity of religion and to have overwhelmed us in ignorance. 



J642 THE VERNE Y FAMILY. 5 

Less personal was the tie which bound Edmund Verney, 
a younger son of the Knight Marshal, to the Royal cause. 
High-minded and chivalrous, as few of his com- 
Verneythe panioHs werc, he submitted his life to the stern 
younger. duties imposed upon him by a religion firmly held 
and, in its essence, hardly distinguishable from Puritanism. Yet 
his warmth of character, combined with his military training — 
he had served first under the Dutch, and afterwards in the ill- 
fated Northern Army — fixed him on the side of Charles. 
His letter to " Brothcr," he wrote to Sir Ralph, who remained 
his brother, constant to the Parliamentary cause, "what I feared 
is proved too true, which is your being against the King. 
Give me leave to tell you, in mine opinion 'tis most unhand- 
somely done, and it grieves my heart to think that my father 
already, and I, who so dearly love and esteem you, should be 
bound in consequence — because in duty to our King — to be 
your enemy. I hear it is a great grief to my father.' I beseech 
you consider that Majesty is sacred. God saith, ' Touch not 
mine anointed.' It troubled David that he cut but off the lap 
of Saul's garment. I believe ye will all say ye intend not to 
hurt the King, but can any of ye warrant any one shot to say 
it shall not endanger his very person ? I am so much troubled 
to think of your being of the side you are, that I can write no 
more ; only I shall pray for peace with all my heart ; but if 

superstition, and idolatry, which was doubtless the main cause that put 
the two Houses, with the help of the City of London and other parts of 
the kingdom, to enter upon this great, high, and dangerous design, that 
so they might the more easily compass and bring about a full and perfect 
reformation in the Church, which they evidently foresaw that it could not 
possibly be otherwise eifected." D'Ewes's Diary, ffarl. MSS. 163, fol. 
324b. TAe Memoirs of a Cavalier cannot be quoted as genuine contem- 
porary evidence, but they proceed from a shrewd writer in the next gene- 
ration who had access to traditional information, and his account of the 
matter corresponds with that of D'Ewes and Verney. " My old comrades," 
the fictitious cavalier is supposed to write, " were some with us, some 
against us, as their opinions happened to differ in religion." Many of the 
contemporary pamphlets take a similar view of the situation. 

' There is a touch of human nature in this. The father is displeased 
with his eldest son for doing precisely what he had only refrained from 
doing because of his own personal obligations to Charles, 



6 CAVALIERS AND ROUNDHEADS. CH. i. 

God grant not that, yet that He will be pleased to turn your 
heart that you may so express your duty to your King that 
your father may still have cause to rejoice in you." ' There 
was but little worldly "wisdom in this letter, and it cost the 
writer a brother's affection, till common misfortune brought 
together again the hearts which had been rudely severed ; but 
its warmth and impetuosity renders it the more instructive to 
those whose duty it is to trace the causes which gave to Charles 
some of the most faithful of his supporters. Not the Puritans 
alone found in the writings of the Old Testament, composed 
under Eastern skies, an infallible guide amidst the political 
controversies of the Western world, especially when the language 
of those writings favoured conduct of which the reader 
happened to approve. 

With all the fervour of an honest heart, young Edmund 
Verney might pray for peace, but there was nothing in his con- 
ception of the situation which was likely to hasten it. 
rate Royai- More was to be expected from the little group which 
'^'^" gathered round Falkland, and which included 

Spencer, Southampton, and Carnarvon. It is true that such 
men as these had not much more reverence for bishops than 
the Knight Marshal had, but dread of a Puritan domination 
was common to them all. They did not, indeed, wage war 
against it in the spirit of a convocation of divines. What they 
disliked was the mental narrowness of its teachers. Theirs - 
was the rebellion of the modern world, with its intellectual 
inquisitiveness and its distrust of authoritative assertion, against 
the strict formulas of the Calvinistic creed, and the rigid in- 
sistence of its holders upon the due payment of the anise and 
cummin of human duty. Their political ideas grew out of their 
intellectual principles. Something, too, was due to their dread 
of social changes. A great landowner, accustomed to an assured 
position in the world, would be hardly likely to welcome the 
claim of artisans and tradesmen to be heard on the questions 
of the day. He naturally leant to the maintenance of authority, 
though he wished to see authority tempered and restrained

by the opinion of the upper classes assembled in Parliament. 
Yet, bitterly as these men were opposed to the rule of the 
Calvinist preacher, they were no less bitterly opposed to the 
rule of the soldier. Their intellectual position combined with 
their social position to bring them into sharp antagonism with 
the military party, and they did their utmost to urge Charles 
to reopen the negotiations with his Parliament, against which 
he seemed to have firmly closed the door. 

If Falkland and his friends had but little influence upon 
the immediate course of affairs, it was not because theij 
opinions were moderate. Nothing can be more falla- 
their weak- cious than the popular belief that in times of revolu- 
"^^' tion violent counsels prevail merely because they are 

violent. In reality they prevail because those who advance 
them have a keen though limited perception of the conditions 
under which they are called upon to act. To be moderate, in 
any real sense of the word, requires the highest powers of the 
imagination. He who would reconcile adverse parties must 
possess something more than a love of peace and a contempt 
of extreme doctrines. He must have a clear and sympa- 
thetic perception of that which is best and noblest on either 
side ; and it was the perception of anything good or noble in 
Puritanism that Falkland and his associates were entirely 
lacking. 

The gay soldier, the modest country gentleman, the medi- 
tative reasoner, do not complete the tale of Royalism. One 
Edmund figure is still lacking. Edmund Waller remained 
Waller. a,t Westminster, preferring the dishonourable post 
of a spy on Charles's behalf to active service in the field.' 
Rich, witty, and licentious,^ the writer of smooth verses, 
addressed sometimes to the Queen, whose favour he courted 
as assiduously as he afterwards courted that of the Lord 
Protector, or of Charles II., he regarded war and Puritanism 
with equal aversion. If occasionally, for fashion's sake, he 
gave utterance to patriotic sentiments, in his heart he preferred.

the sunny days spent at court to the clash of civil debate. 
There was no high imagination in his art or in his life, and 
when the war broke out he merely sought to make the best of 
an awkward situation. 

It is easy to pass by a career such as Waller's with a sneer 
at the folly of poetical dreamers who engage in the hard reali- 
Waiier's '''^^ °^ political life. For those who wish to pene 
literary trate to the springs of human action it is difficult 

posuion. . . . • 1 i_ 1 

to hnd a more mstructive personage m the wriole 
course of the century in which he lived. It is little that, at the 
Court of Henrietta Maria, he threw himself ardently into the 
literary movement which substituted in poetry the balanced 
fall of that rhymed verse which reached its highest perfection 
in the hands of Pope for the chastened irregularity of the 
Elizabethan poets. What is important is that the causes which 
made him one of the most striking of the literary precursors of 
that style which is usually known as that of the Restoration, 
made him also a precursor of Restoration morals and of 
Restoration politics. 

Something, no doubt, of that great law of reaction by 
which the courses of humanity are governed is visible in the 
adoption, by one whose own life was so dissolute as to cast off 
all moral restraints, of a scheme of poetry of which the chief 
characteristic is the subordination of independent thought and 
fancy to the severest artificial laws of style. Yet, even in this 
respect, Waller was floating on a tide which ran with a greater 
sweep than could be accounted for by the peculiarities of his 
individual character. The wild exuberance of the Elizabethan 
literature, wasting itself away in pretty emptinesses and frigid 
conceits, called aloud for writers who would place a curb upon 
its extravagances, if it were only the curb of form. 

Elizabethan moral effort needed the curb as much as its 
poetry, and in men of lower aims the form imposed would 
necessarily have but little connection with the 
pure spiritual realities of life. Not to forsake the pursuit 

oya ism. ^j- gg^g„^] pleasure but to combine it with social 
politeness became a second nature to Waller and his like. To 
honour the King, because he exercised no minute suoervision

over the conduct of his admirers, became the keynote of their 
simple pohtics, whilst peace was an object of desire, merely 
because it made it easier to pursue a career of self-indulgence. 
The pure Royalism of the Restoration already appeared in 
Waller in all its native offensiveness. 

Yet, offensive as it was, it was of a piece with the other 
strivings of the time. Everywhere was to be seen the pursuit, 

, . not of liberty, but of a limiting order. The Royal au-

ceremonies, were dear to many mmds as stays to the 
weaknesses of their individual natures. Above all, it was Puri- 
tanism which gave to those whose energies were most self-centred 
the power which always follows upon submission to law. Puri- 
tanism not only formed the strength of the opposition to Charles, 
but the strength of England itself Parliamentary liberties, and 

even Parliamentary control, were worth contending 
of com- for ; but on these points it would not have been diffi- 
promise. ^^jj. ^^ (jiscovcr some working compromise sufficient, 
if not to satisfy Charles, at least to satisfy his more reasonable 
supporters. On the other hand, the Parliamentary leaders had 
not yet committed themselves to the adoption of the complete 
Presbyterian system, which, with its apparatus of Church 
courts and its rigid orthodoxy, was almost as terrible in the 
eyes of those who looked hopefully to the free play of cultivated 
intelligence as it was to those who merely wished to give the 
rein to their animal passions. Yet even this Presbyterianism 
covered something greater than itself. The laws by which the 

progress of human society is governed work not ir- 
strength of tespectivc of human agency, but by the influence of 
Puritanism, gurrounding conditions upon human wills, whereby 
the activity of those wills is roused to react upon the conditions. 
Therefore, it is not enough that the intellect be cultivated, or 
that forms of government or of worship be established to nourish 
the social feelings. Knowledge may cover the earth as the 
waters cover the sea, order may be secured, and reverence 
may be shown where reverence is due, but unless the resolute 
will be there to struggle onwards and upwards towards an 
ideal higher still, the gift will have been bestowed in vain. 



to CAVALIERS AND ROUNDHEADS. Cll.l. 

It is the glory of Puritanism that it found its highest work 
in the strengthening of the will. To be abased in the abiding 
presence of the Divine Sufferer, and strengthened in the assur- 
ance of help from the risen Saviour, was the path which led 
the Puritan to victory over the temptations which so easily 
beset him. Then, as ever, it was not in the lap of ease and 
luxury that fortitude and endurance were most readily fostered, 
nor was it by culture and intelligence that the strongest 
natures were hardened. The spiritual and mental struggle 
through which the Puritan entered on his career of Divine 
service was more likely to be real with those who were already 
inured to a hard struggle with the physical conditions of the 
world, and whose minds were not distracted by too compre- 
hensive knowledge of many-sided nature. The ilame which 
flickered upwards burnt all the purer where the literature of 
the world, with its wisdom and its folly, found no entrance. 
It is not in the measured cadences of Milton, but in the 
homely allegory of the tinker of Elstow, that the Puritan 
gospel is most clearly revealed. 

England, it has been said by one who, in our own days, 
has exhibited the old Puritan virtues to a world which had 
well-nigh forgotten them, has been saved by its adventurers — 
that is to say, by the men who, careless whether their ways 
are like the ways of others, or whether there may not be 
some larger interpretation of the laws by which the world 
is governed than " any which they have themselves been 
able to conceive, have set their hearts on realising, first in 
themselves and then in others, their ideal of that which is 
best and holiest. Such adventurers the noblest of the Puritans 
were. Many things existed not dreamed of in their theology, 
many things which they misconceived, or did not even con- 
ceive at all ; but they were brave and resolute, feeding their 
minds upon the bread of heaven, and determined within them- 
selves to be servants of no man and of no human system. It 
was with such as these that Falkland failed to count ; and to 
fail to count with them was to neglect that very quality of self- 
denying and therefore masterful purpose, the presence of which 
saves Parliamentary majorities from dwindling into a mere

expression of predominant indolence, and the accumulation of 
knowledge from ministering to the satisfaction of learned 
drones. 

Thus it came about that, whilst the noblest elements on the 
King's side were favourable to peace, the noblest elements on 
Militant the side of the Parliament were favourable to war. 
Pumanism. f jj^j. jj ^^g g^ ^^^ ^^j merely owing to the bitter 
memories which had been branded on the mind of the Puritan 
by long oppression. The man of intellect necessarily looks 
forward to a gradual process of amelioration which can but be 
checked by the interposition of violence. The man of strong 
moral purpose is no less prompt to think that the evil of the 
world can be removed or at least diminished by the interven- 
tion of power ; and in this particular case he had to dread, if 
Charles regained his authority, not merely the absence of 
power in his own hands, but its active exercise against him- 
self. 

If war there was to be, it was well that it should not be 
waged entirely on social or political grounds, and, above all, 
that it should not degenerate, like the troubles of the 
not a war French Revolution, into a war of classes. It is true 
'^'^ ■ that, on the whole, the nobility and gentry took the 
side of the King, whilst the townsmen and the yeomanry took 
the side of the Parliament. Yet there were enough of Puritan 
nobles and gentlemen, and enough of townsmen and yeomen 
who were not Puritans, to prevent the religious cleft from accu- 
rately coinciding with the social cleft. 

Of the two parties, the Parliamentary was the more prompt to 
throw off the delusion that peace was still attainable. Six days be-

The Houses I^ the immediate neighbourhood of London their

or even to gain time to prepare for war.^ A defeat of his troops 
in a skirmish near Coventry came opportunely to strengthen the 
party of peace, and on the 25th he despatched Southampton 
and Culpepper to Westminster to ask that commissioners might 
be appointed to treat for peace, and to declare his own determi- 



before them to justify his statements. As he could not name the authors 
" of the outrages, they ordered the Mayor of Canterbury to inquire whether 
any of the townsmen had participated in them. L.J, v. 360.

^ This view of the case, which is thoroughly consonant with Charles's 
character, would reconcile Clarendon's statement that he wanted to test 
his opponents with Spencer's, who assured his wife that ' the King, when 
he sent those messages, did heartily desire ' an accommodation. Spencer

The Lords, though they compelled Southampton to deliver 
his message at the bar, threw no further obstacles in his way.

sideration, and when Pym, wiser than his more violent sup- 
porters, rose to oppose the ill-timed motion, an attempt was 
made to hoot down the great leader of the party of resistance. 
At last Culpepper was called to the bar. There the representa- 
tive of the King, ' looking more like a culprit than a Privy 
Councillor,' silently delivered his message in writing. A reply 
„ . . , was almost immediately returned by both Houses, to

standard, and recalled his denunciation of treason 
against their members, they could not treat.' 

The Houses, as well as Charles, had their own constitutional 
scheme, the abandonment of which they regarded as worse than 
war itself, and it was most improbable that any negotiation 
would produce that responsible ministry and that Puritan settle- 
ment of the Church on which their hearts were set. Yet it can 
hardly be doubted that their chief motive in rejecting the pro- 
posal made was their personal distrust of Charles. Their know- 
ledge of his past intrigues led them to conclude that the pit- 
sent overture merely concealed an intention to gain time to 
injure them.^ 

At all events, if the Houses rejected Charles's offer, it was 
not because they underestimated the gravity of their situation.

being spectacles of pleasure too commonly expressing lascivious 
mirth and levity, it is therefore thought fit that while these sad 
causes and set times of humiliation do continue, public stage- 
plays shall cease and be forborne.' Prynne had his way at last, 
though the terms of the announcement were hardly such as to 
give him complete satisfaction. 

Sad as the outlook appeared, there was no expectation at 
Westminster of a prolonged war. No one there believed that, 
if prompt measures were taken, there would be any 
expected to difficulty in reducing the King to submission. They 
w^ere quite sure that moral right was on their side. 
The seizure of arms and the plunder of suspected houses 
which, when it was the work of Parliamentary officers, was at 
worst an irregularity, was an intolerable crime in a Royalist 
commander. The nickname ' Prince Robber ' was soon affixed 
'Prince to Rupcrt. The imputation did him less than justice. 
Robber.' Though the licence which Rupert allowed his soldiers 
surprised and shocked a generation which had never seen the 
face of war,' he did not enrich himself by plunder. It is strange 
that he had not contracted more of the vices of that evil school 
in which he had been trained. 

At York, the Parliamentarians and not the Royalists were 
held to be the plunderers ; but there was no difference of opinion

to the mercy of the unruly multitude, I cannot find that this is 
the liberty of the subject ; nor do I find that it is in God's law to 
take arms against their lawful King to depose him ; for sure they 
have not made his person known to all those that they have 
employed in this war to spare him and not to kill him ; * but I

was sent ; for surely 't is not peace which they desire. Sure 
they trust in that mighty host." ^ 

Rupert was doing his best to give to his uncle some chance 

of being able to resist ' that mighty host.' On September 6 he 

appeared before Leicester, and summoned the town

^ This rests on D'Ewes's evidence. Writing on March 6, 1643, he 
says that the King ' at Nottingham, in August last past, during his dis- 
tressed condition a little after the defeat of his troops near Coventry . . . 
did secretly intimate that he would consent to a thorough reformation in 
religion besides what else we could reasonably desire ; but then nothing 
would be accepted but that his Majesty must desert all those that had

lives.' The date given would seem to refer the offer to the time of Cul- 
pepper's mission, but the last clause attaches it to that of Falkland. I 
have no doubt that the lattey explanation is correct. It is most impro- 
bable that, if this offer had been rejected in August, Charles would have 
sent another mission in September. D'Ewes's Diary, Hail. MSS, 164.

It completed the division of England into two opposite camps, 
and threatened to lengthen out the Civil War beyond all 
possible calculation. Up to this moment there had been 
nothing but hesitation at Nottingham.^ There would be no 
hesitation now. Those who had been eager for peace would

whisper in secret, he would have gone far to disarm opposition. 
Unhappily for himself, this was what he could not do. His 
proposal represented, at the most, but a passing mood. 
Having failed to do his work it was flung aside, with the sole 
result of increasing the suspicions of those to whom it had 
been made, when they saw concessions so distinctly held out 
and so recklessly abandoned. 

The adoption by the Houses of a policy of confiscation 

was followed by a high bid for the assistance of the Scots. 

Sept. 7. The General Assembly had lately suggested that 

to'bf "'""^^ unity of religion would prove the soundest basis of a 

abolished, political alliance. On September 7, the Commons, 

without a dissentient voice, approved of a letter in which the 

„ Scots were assured that episcopacy should be 

abolished, and this letter was ratified by the Lords.' 

It is true that the promise which it contained had no legal force, 

but it marked the time at which those who now posed as 

the nation set themselves to reorganise the institutions of the 

Church, not upon mature consideration of the whole conditions 

of the problem, but according to the exigencies of warfare.

clergyman found wearing a surplice was held to be a fair mark

fat bucks in E oyalist parks shot down. Such men as these 
were hard to control. At one time a body of them broke 
into mutiny, demanding increase of pay. At another time a

about a service which I am wiUing to undertake, and therefore I 
desire to know what you will please to command me." He then 
withdrew without waiting for an answer. Some little time after- 
wards, a large number of the members of the House of 
Commons came to look for him, hoping to obtain some word 
of recognition. They found him smoking in the Court of 
Wards. He stood up and gravely saluted them in silence, 
with his hat in one hand and his pipe in the other. That 
afternoon he rode ofF towards Northampton, carrying with him 
his coffin and his winding-sheet, together with the scutcheon

He had himself refrained from appearing at the leave-laking of the 
General, not wishing to see him set off ' against his distressed Sove- 
reign, being now reduced to the greatest calamity of any person living, 
for he had sent twice to the two Houses within this fortnight several sub- 
missive messages to crave peace, which were rejected with infinite scorn 
and contempt. His Majesty in person — having nothing but the name and 
shadow of majesty left — was now at Nottingham, or near thereabouts, 
and had wanted money for about a week's space to pay any of his soldiers, 
horse and foot, who daily slipped from him ; and those who stuck to him 
. . . were merely left to slaughter and destruction if they fought it out, to 
punishment if they were taken, or to an ignoble flight if they would save 
themselves. And, for such noblemen and gentlemen as had been drawn 
to him by his own letters, and to whom he had given his promise to pro- 
tect and defend them from violence, they were everywhere pursued, taken, 
and made captives, and like to be utterly ruined in their fortunes, because 
the two Houses of Parliament had already declared that the Common 
wealth should be satisfied all the charges of this war out of their estates, 
and that was likely to grow to an immense sum ; for we were now at

CHAPTER II. 

POWICK BRIDGE AND EDGEHILL. 

When Essex arrived at Northampton his intention was to 
march straight upon Nottingham. Charles, who, though he 
1642. was no longer in danger of a surprise, as Essex still 
tends to believed him to be, was not yet strong enough to 
Netting- accept a battle, resolved to march westwards in 
„f°', , search of reinforcements. A body of s.ooo Welsh- 

Charles's , .... . , .... 

plans. men were only awaitmg his arrival to join him, and 

Shropshire and Cheshire had a sufficiently large Cavalier 
element to furnish him with a contingent.' Chester was the 
port of transit for Ireland, offering possibilities of future aid 
from that quarter. 

On the 13th, Charles left Nottingham. If the gentry of 

Nottinghamshire and the neighbouring shires were mainly on 

his side, the opinion of the townsmen and the free- 

Charies ' holders was against him. He therefore disarmed 

Notting. the trained bands, and distributed their pikes and 

"^ muskets amongst his followers. On his way he 

sought to bind more closely to his cause all who now bore 
arms in his defence, by reiterating the assurances, which he 
had frequently given of late, that he had no intention of 
returning to the system of Laud and Strafford. On the 19th, 

Sept. 19. on the road between Stafford and Wellington, he 
fcs'fo"tohis called his army round him : "Your consciences and 
*™y- your loyalty," he said, " have brought you hither, to 

fight for your religion, your King, and the laws of the land.

You shall meet with no enemies but traitors, most of them

that, if God gave him the victory, he would ' defend and main-

Church of England ; ' he would ' govern according to the 
known laws of the land, maintain the just privileges and 
freedom of Parliament,' and ' observe inviolably the laws ' to 
which he had given his consent in the existing Parliament. 
He hoped that if, in waging war, he was compelled temporarily 
to violate the law, the mischief which would ensue might be

laid at the door of those who were the real authors of the 
war.' 

The effect of this manifesto was all that Charles could wish. 
Those who heard him, and thousands more who subsequently 

read his words, enthusiastically responded to an 

appeal which was directed to one of the strongest of 
the permanent instincts of human nature: its desire to be 
guarded by the law and customs to which it has long been 
habituated. Charles's partisans, at least, did not care to remind 
him that it was mockery to ask those who believed that the 
existing law consecrated injustice to be content to wait for the 
removal of that injustice till the King and a complete House 
of Lords were ready to attend to their complaints. 

Yet, even among Charles's own followers, voices of dissatis- 
faction were raised. Those who could think of no way in 
which Puritans might be conciliated were disgusted at the 
favourable reception accorded by Charles to Catholics. " How 

much I am unsatisfied with the proceedings here,'' 
Spencer's ' wrote Spencer to his wife, " I have at large expressed 

in several letters. Neither is there wanting daily 
handsome occasion to retire, were it not for grinning honour. 
For let occasion be never so handsome, unless a man were 
resolved to fight on the Parliament side, which, for my part, 1 
had rather be hanged, it will be said without doubt that a man 
is afraid to fight. If there could be an expedient found to 
salve the punctilio of honour, I would ribt continue here an 
hour. The discontent that I and many other honest men 
receive daily is beyond expression." * 

Into this desire for peace, fear of the enemy no longer 
entered. On the 20th, Charles occupied Shrewsbury ; on the 
Sept. 20. 23rd he made himself master of Chester. The

army were rife in the royal quarters. It was generally believed 
that Essex's men deserted as fast as they came in, and that

those who remained with the colours were entirely beyond 
Rumours control. Somc of them, it was said, had jeeringly 
mutinous refused to obey orders by calling out to the officers 
Essex°s ^'^^ S^^^ them, "We are all fellow-traitors here."' 
amiy- Such men, it was thought, would either run away, or 

desert to the King in the first engagement. 

Such rumours were not entirely baseless. The city ap- 
prentices and country labourers, of whom Essex's army was 
Condition of '^i great part composed, were as yet unaccustomed 
mlnfa^'''^' *■" ^^^ coutrol of military discipline. With large 
troops. numbers of them the old feeling, that it was a sin as 

well as a crime to resist the King, had not yet died out. The 
doctrine that they were summoned to fight for King and 
Parliament was, indeed, no merely hypocritical pretext. Those 
who announced it deduced from that constitutional doctrine 
which Pym had enunciated in his assault upon Strafford — the 
doctrine that the King is weakened and endangered by sepa- 
rating himself from Parliament — the principle that whoever 
fought for Parliament was in reality fighting for the King as 
well. Whatever might be said in its favour, it was, at least, 
wanting in the directness which alone commends a principle 
to ordinary minds. Men who had been trained up under 
teachers who had assured them that rebellion was the worst 
of impieties could not help feeling uncomfortable when they 
were called on to march in battle array against the King in 
person. 

Whether, if the King had obtained the upper hand, the Parlia- 
mentary liberties of the country would have been safe in the 
hands of the Spencers and the Southamptons is a question 
which may be answered in various ways by different persons, 
but there can be no doubt whatever that Puritanism would not 
have been safe. To thousands of Englishmen, Puritanism was 
the very Gospel itself, the voice of God speaking to a careless 
Militant generation. Those who believed this were ready to 
Puritanism, jjg rather than allow God's voice upon earth to be 
silenced. If the existing law was against it, let the law be 

' Nicholas to Boswell, Sept. 15. S.P. Dom. ccccxcii. 14. 



1642 MILITANT PURITANISM. 27 

broken. If Parliamentary majorities were against it, let them be 
silenced. It was this feeling, entirely ignored by the Royalists, 
which was already leavening Essex's army, and which was 
ultimately to permeate the army of Fairfax and Cromwell. 
Such a feeling demands something more than respectful recog- 
nition from those whose lot has fallen in days when strength of 
conviction has no need to assert its rights by the sword, be- 
cause it is allowed free space to win its way by the tongue and 
the pen. It is to the pressure of determined minorities, 
weighing, in the full light of freedom, upon lukewarm or hostile 
majorities, that all worthy reforms are still owing. That the 
use of force only renders the object aimed at more difficult of 
attainment was precisely the fact which Charles and Hyde 
were unable to perceive, and which, it must in fairness be 
acknowledged, their Puritan opponents were also unable to 
perceive. 

If Charles could not understand the religious strength of 
the army opposed to him, still less could he understand the 
offence given by the rough and ready ways by which Rupert 
was collecting supplies. The two motives for resistance were 
significantly joined together in some letters from Nehemiah 
Wharton, a subaltern in Essex's army. " Wednesday morn- 
ing," he wrote, "we had tidings that Prince Rupert, that 
diabolical cavalier, had surrounded Leicester and dernanded 
2,000/. or else threatened to plunder the town ; whereupon 
our soldiery were even mad to be at them. . . . Friday morn- 
ing, worthy Mr. Obadiah Sedgwick gave us a worthy sermon, 
and my company in particular marched to hear him in 
rank and file. Mr. John Sedgwick was appointed to preach 
in the afternoon, but we had news that Prince Rupert had 
plundered Marlborough and fired some adjacent towns, and 
our regiment was immediately drawn into the field. . . . Sab- 
bath-day morning, Mr. Marshall, that worthy champion of 
Christ, preached unto us ; afternoon, Mr. Ash. These, with 
their sermons, have already subdued and satisfied more 
malignant spirits amongst us than a thousand armed men 
could have done." ' 

' Wharton to Willingham, Sept. 13. Archaol. xxxv. 322.

The indignation with which Rupert was regarded was none 
the less genuine because many of the Parliamentary soldiers 
had been guilty of plundering innocent householders, or of 
shooting deer in the parks of the Royalist gentry. The time 
was now coming when the military ardour of the soldiers would

fuwshu the King quitted Nottingham, Essex reviewed his 
array. army at Northampton. He saw enough to convince 

him that there was no hope of maintaining order unless his 
troops were punctually paid. On the isth he wrote to re- 
quest the Houses to send him 100,000/. He was still confident

this contribution was not easy to evade. " The whole City," 
as the soldiers tersely put it, "were now either real or con- 
strained Roundheads." ^

Parliament ^f jj^g county, to trample out the disaffection of 
the University. 

Say's conduct was as conciliatory as could be expected. 
There was a bonfire in the street of 'Papist' books and 
pictures, and the soldiers scoffed at the idolatrous 
Say at' windows in the Cathedral, and fired shots at the 
images of the Virgin with the infant Saviour in her 
arms, over the gates of St. Mary's and All Souls. Say, however, 
was lenient with the University itself. The Christ Church plate 
he found hidden behind a wainscot, and this, with other con- 
cealed property, he adjudged to be lawful prize, but he told 
the Fellows that as long as they kept their plate ' in places fit 
for plate, the treasury or buttery,' it ' should remain untouched.' 
Most of the colleges promised to comply with Say's require- 
ment, receiving from him in return an assurance that there 
should be no attempt to injure the liberties and privileges of 
the University.' 

Whilst Say was doing his best to establish the authority of 

the Parliament in Oxford, Byron was making his way towards 

_ Worcester, which he entered on the i6th. The

in a direction parallel with the King's march on Shrewsbury.

On the 22nd there was the rumour, which ultimately proved 
false, to the efTect that a battle was already raging before the

least pressed on for two miles at a running pace. The next 
day there was equal eagerness. The army was now 
but four miles from Worcester, and the soldiers were 
clamouring to be led to battle.' 

The day did not pass without fighting. Worcester was no 

place to be defended against a superior force. Its walls were 

in ruin, and Byron had made up his mind to retreat. Rupeit 

had arrived to cover his march ; but Rupert was not content 

with the simple fulfilment of so humble a task.

Royalists were without defensive armour, but they had the 
advantage, always so great with raw^ troops, of being the 
attacking force. The Parliamentarians were driven back in 
confusion as they attempted to struggle out of the lane. 
After a short resistance they broke and fled. For nine miles 
they did not draw rein, long after the enemy had ceased 
to follow them. At last, crossing the Severn at Upton, 
they came up at Pershore with Essex's body-guard of a hundred 
picked men, many of whom afterwards occupied high posts in

If it had been in his power he would have taken the field 
at once ; but, in spite of Rupert's efforts, he was still ill-pro- 
vided with arms. He had money enough to pay his infantry, 
but the horsemen had to forage for themselves, or,

among the soldiers, that all rich men were Roundheads.^ In 
spite of all that Essex could do, the Royalist gentry in the 
neighbourhood of Worcester shared the fate of their opponents 
round Shrewsbury. Essex assured the Houses that he and 
his officers had done their best to restrain these malpractices, 
but that he could not wonder at the misconduct of his men, 
'seeing freedom of plunder was permitted on the other 
side.' '

series of local struggles had been going on in different parts of

hensiijn was felt at Westminster in consequence of his pro- 
ceedings. 

In the North, opinion was less in favour of Parliament 
than in the South. Yet even there the towns were mostly on 
its side. Manchester, the London of the North, as from its 
noted Puritanism it was scornfully termed by the neighbouring 
cavaliers, had been for some time besieged by Lord 
The sieg°e of Strange, who now became Earl of Derby upon his 
Jfrsed°"" father's death. On October 2, the new Earl was 
Sept 20 compelled to abandon the hope of taking Man- 
P^S'S^^"'?" Chester.' In Yorkshire opinion was divided, and 

9f Yorkshire. ^ ' 

the gentry on either side agreed to hold their county 
neutral in the struggle which had already commenced else- 
where.^ 

Whether it be true or not that Lord Fairfax only agreed to 
the pacification on condition of its obtaining the sanction of 
Parliament,^ it was inevitable that the Houses would refuse 
their assent to an arrangement which would only serve to 
increase the forces of the King. If the Yorkshire gentry were 
freed from danger at home, they would place their services at 
Charles's disposal elsewhere, whilst it was unlikely that the 
citizens of Leeds or Bradford would leave their looms to take 
service under Essex at Worcester. Even in Yorkshire the 
pacification was not everywhere accepted. The Hothams 
were already disinclined to acknowledge the supremacy of the 

Fairfaxes, and the fact that Lord Fairfax had agreed

the wishes of Parliament. ' 

In this way England was divided by an undulating line, 
which left only the less wealthy and the less thickly populated 
Respective districts of the North and West to Charles. Yet it 
tteram.°^ would be a mistake to estimate his strength solely 
batants. ^y geographical considerations. Some of the coun- 
ties, such as Worcestershire and Herefordshire, were strongly 
Royalist in feeling, though they were for the present obliged 
to dissemble their sentiments. In many others the majority 
of the gentry were either already gathered round Charles at 
Shrewsbury, or were ready to support him at home if a favour- 
able opportunity occurred. A victory in the field might be 
followed by serious consequences. If the Royalist gentry 
should, at any time, succeed in getting the upper hand, it 
would be difficult to overthrow them. They were accustomed 
to take the lead in county business, and the smaller towns 
would be too isolated to hold out long against them. If 
Parliament was to win, it must either gain a decisive victory at 
the opening of the campaign, or it must substitute a new and 
stronger organisation for that to which the country districts had 
long been accustomed. For the present the hopes of all men 
were fixed upon the main armies. One battle, it was generally 
believed, would decide everything.

of taxation, short of regular taxation would supply the require- 
whichthey ments of the army, and from regular taxation the 
ready to Houses shrank. They continued to ask for volun- 
unpose. j^^y g.j.|.^ ^^ loans, but, like the benevolences de- 
manded by former kings, those voluntary payments were as 
like enforced taxation as possible. 

It was unlikely that such a course would remain long 
unchallenged. A lawyer named Fountain refused to reply to 
Oct. 5. a request for a voluntary gift, and appealed to the 
taprison. Petition of Right. The Petition of Right, said 
Fountain. Marten bluntly, was intended to restrain kings, not 
to restrain Parliaments. Fountain was finally sent to prison 
for. contempt in refusing to answer. A committee was ap- 
pointed to prepare a declaration, asserting that the Houses 
were legally entitled to require a contribution, and that those 
who refused payment were to be marked as malignants and 
disaffected persons.' 

Charles was in even greater straits for money. He obtained 
£),oool. by the sale of a peerage to Sir Richard Newport, a wealthy 
Sale of a Shropshire knight.^ Enthusiastic Royalists offered 
peerage. (.{jgij. gtorcs of plate to be melted into coin, and no 
scruple was felt in compelling those who were not enthusiastic 
Royalists to make a similar sacrifice.' Amongst those who were 
most forward in offering assistance were the Catholic gentry. 
Their loyalty was never doubtful. Wherever the Parliament held 

sway they were liable to outrage and plunder, whilst 
lies support from time to time they heard that one or other of the 

priests whom they reverenced had been butchered 
according to law. Before Charles left Chester, he called on the 
numerous Catholics of Lancashire to provide themselves with 
arms, and he now invited all the Catholics of his kingdom to

is to tell you," he had written to Newcastle, after his return to 
Shrewsbury, " that this rebellion is grown to that height, that I 
must not look of ^ what opinion men are who at this time are 
willing and able to serve me. Therefore I do not only permit 
but command you to make use of all my loving subjects' services, 
without examining their consciences — more than their loyalty 
to me— as you shall find most to conduce to the upholding of 
my just legal power." ' No doubt he in this way obtained sup- 
port which he could ill spare, but, in so doing, he raised a fresh 
barrier between himself and the hearts of his Protestant sub- 
jects. 

It was not the Queen's fault that plentiful supplies had not 

flowed in from beyond the seas. No sooner had she arrived in 

Holland, than she threw herself with characteristic

activity in ardour into the task of raismg money with which to

of English birth to forsake the Dutch service for that of their 
native Prince. She had jewels to pawn,'' and she had in her 
favour the powerful assistance of the Prince of Orange ; but, 
on the other hand, the commercial oligarchy, which filled the 
Assembly of the States of Holland, was jealous of the Prince 
and of his royal alliance. The populace, usually in favour of 
the House of Orange, was excited against his Catholic guest. 
The English Parliament sent over an able diplomatist, Walter 
Strickland, to plead its cause. Even after Henrietta Maria had 
succeeded in bearing down opposition in Holland, fresh dis- 
appointment was in store for her. A vessel which she contrived

the Queen succeeded in sending 200 men over in small boats, 
she was unable to despatch the arms which were so much needed 
at Shrewsbury. She had at one time hoped to be able soon to 
rejoin her husband in England. She now lamented that she 
could do but little for him, and talked of seeking a refuge in 
France till his fate had been decided in the field.'

it was felt to be not impossible that, in spite of all resist- 
^ . , ance, Charles might reach London, and it was cer- 

The trained ' ° i , i i i 

bands called tain that if he occupied London he would be master 

of the kingdom. London, long unused to war, was an

that could be done was to stretch chains ^across the streets, in 

Measures Order to throw difficulties in the way of a charge of

men whom they commanded, their resolution to live 

and die with the Parliament, and the great majority of the men 

Q^j ^ declared themselves ready to follow their leaders in 

the service of the City even beyond the City precincts.' 

The Royalists of the City, on the other hand, were growing 

every day more confident that they would soon see Charles 

enter London in triumph. They formed a not insignificant 

The cit minority, having amongst them many of the wealthy 

Royalists merchants. They openly wore red ribbons in their

hats as a token 01 their opmions, and they were strong 
enough to drive out a mob which broke into St. Paul's to pull 
down the organ.^ 

Not only from Charles's army was danger apprehended at 
Westminster. It was now known that the greater part of Corn- 
wall had declared for the King, and that the Earl of Newcastle 
had collected a force of 8,000 men in the North. The belief

that, in presence of the irritation thus caused, those who sighed 
for peace were in despair. " No neutrality," wrote Roe, who

On the 20th a fresh danger was discovered. It was known 
in London that Charles was once more looking to foreign 
The King powers for aid. Two Scots— Henderson and 
Denm^kfor Cochrane— had been commissioned to visit the 
••^'P' King of Denmark, to urge him to send arms for 

12,000 men, 24 cannon, 100,000/., a fleet of ships of war, 
3,000 German infantry, and i,ooo horse.^

within four miles of Coventry, and that he had absolutely

It is evident that the example of the success of the Scottish 
Covenant had blinded Pym to the danger of dividing by yet 
harsher lines the already divided kingdom. For the present 
his proposal came to nothing. It was accepted in principle 

by both Houses, and a declaration calling on all

well-meanmg persons to associate themselves to- 
gether was put in circulation. Nothing was further done in 
the matter till the absolute need of Scottish succour revived 
the ill-considered proposition. 

It was not by oaths, but by pikes and muskets in the hands 
of men who needed no oaths to bind them, that London was 
to be defended. On the 21st it was decided that a 
newarmyof 16,000 men shouldbe raised to act in cor\- 
to beleviS' junction with the City trained bands, and that the whole 
Warwick of 'his force should be placed under the command of 
the Earl of Warwick. Horses were to be taken from 
their owners wherever they could be found in the 
London stables. A garrison was to be sent to occupy Windsor.' 
Vigorous as these measures were, there was one man in the 
Parliamentary army by whom they were not considered ade- 
quate. Cromwell, as soon as the war threatened to break out, 
_ ,,, had accepted a commission under Essex as a captain

the future, he was second to none in grasping the needs of the 
present. " Your troops," he said to his cousin Hampden, in 
speaking of the disparity between the cavalry of the two armies,'

' Peacock's Army Lists of the Roiiiidheads and Cavaliers, 56. That 
Cromwell was ever a captain of foot, as Carlyle thought, is a mistake.

ser. xii. 285, he is described as captain of a, troop of arquebusiers. In-

' Carlyle's Cromwell, Speech XI. It is useless to attempt to fix the 
date of the conversation precisely, but the reference to the raising of new 
regiments seems to connect it with the raising of those forces under 
Warwick. After Edgehill there would probably have been somethin"

perhaps with some thought in his mind of the headlong flight 
at Powick Bridge, " are most of them old decayed serving men 
and tapsters, and such kind of fellows, and their troops are 
gentlemen's sons and persons of quality. Do you think that 
the spirits of such base and mean fellows will ever be able to 
encounter gentlemen that have honour, and courage, and reso- 
lution in them? .... You must get men of a spirit, and 
take it not ill what I say— I know you will not— of a spirit that 
is likely to go on as far as gentlemen will go, or else you will 
be beaten still." Cromwell's idea seemed impracticable to 
Hampden. It would not be long, however, before the prin- 
ciples which he had enunciated would be brought to the test. 
Cromwell's own troopers, picked men from the Fens, were as 
sternly Puritan as himself. 

In the meanwhile Charles was steadily pressing on, avoid- 
ing Parliamentary strongholds such as Warwick and Coventry, 
Q^^ ^^ and evidently eager to reach London as soon as 
TheKingat possible. On the 21st he slept at Southam. On 
the following morning the powerful spell cast by 
Royalty over those who had no vehement opinions was illus- 
Oct. 22. trated by Charles's meeting with a country gentle- 
chaSwfth ™^" who cared so little for the mortal strife which 
Shudc'-'' w^^ dividing his country as to be starting for the 
burgh. hunting field when armies were on the march. 

"Who is that,'' asked the King, "that hunts so merrily when 1 
am going to fight for my crown and dignity?" Richard 
Shuckburgh, for so the gentleman was named, was summoned 
to Charles's presence, and left it resolved to embark heart and 
soul in his sovereign's cause. He gathered his tenants to- 
gether, put arms into their hands, and on the following day 
was knighted on a field of battle.' 

Charles had no thought of fighting immediately when on 
the evening of the 22nd he arrived at Edgcott. The next day 
was a Sunday, and he intended, after sending on a detach- 
ment to capture Banbury, to give a day's rest to the remainder

of his army. In the night Rupert sent him word thai Essex 
was on his track, and had already reached Kineton, some 
seven miles to the west of the scattered positions

on the following morning the brow of the steep descent which 
under the name of Edgehill rises high over the undulating 
plain of Warwickshire. '

tended to await the attack of the enemy. Yet there were no 

signs that Essex would attempt such a foolhardy

Charles at enterprise as to scale the heights as long as they 

^^ ' ' were guarded by an army at least as numerous as 
his own, and, in consequence of its superiority in cavalry, de- 
cidedly stronger. He had been obliged to leave garrisons in 
Worcester and elsewhere, whilst Hampden with two regiments, 
in charge of the greater part of the artillery, was a day's march 
in the rear. The forces ready on both sides to take part in 
the battle were about 14,000.* When Essex drew up his 
troops at some little distance from the foot of the hill, the 
Royal army had no choice but to descend. It was in the 
midst of a hostile population, and with Banbury fortified in its 
rear and the Parliamentary army in front, it would hardly 
escape starvation. 

Whether these considerations presented themselves to 
Charles is more than doubtful. In his camp victory was re- 
^ ,, garded as a certainty. It was fully believed that

1642 RUPERT, LINDSEY, AND FORTH. 43 

Full of spirit as the Royalists were, they had to contend 
against one fatal disadvantage. Charles had himself under- 
Kuperfs taken the direction of the campaign. Rupert was 
fheai™'" ^^"'ost the Buckingham of the hour, carrying his 
irresolute uncle with him by his fire and energy. 
The young Prince had not been many days in England before 
he took offence at some expressions used by Digby,' and, by 
refusing to receive instructions from Charles through a secretary, 
had drawn down on himself a well-merited reproof from Falk- 
land. " In neglecting me," said Falkland, " you neglect the 
King." Worst of all was the disastrous arrangement by which 
Rupert was exempted from taking the orders of the Earl of 
1 .indsey, the General of the army, whose tried fidelity was beyond 
Lindseys disputc. His career in Charles's service had been one 
'^*""- of patient submission to conditions which could only 

result in failure. He had commanded the fleet which, in 1626, 
was baffled by storms in the Bay of Biscay, the fleet which, in 
1628, had attempted in vain, after Buckingham's death, to 
carry succour to Rochelle, and the fleet which, in 1635, having 
been fitted out with the proceeds of the first levy of ship- 
money, sailed up and down the Channel exposed to universal 
mockery. Such a man was not likely to take umbrage readily. 
Vet even Lindsey shrank from the task of commanding an 
army in which he was to have no control over the cavalry, and he 
assured his friends that he could not regard himself as its general, 
and that when the day of battle arrived he would place himself 
at the head of his own regiment, and there would find his 
death. 

Charles accepted Lindsey's reluctance to bear the name 
without the authority of a commander, and directed that his 
place should be filled on the day of battle by the old 
pointed to Scotchman who had defended Edinburgh Castle, 
comman . ^^^ ^j^^ j^^^ recently exchanged the title of Lord 
Ruthven for that of Earl of Forth. He would not give to 
the new commander the authority which he had dashed out of 
Lindsey's hands.^

it was brought down the steep face of the hill and

There were old soldiers in the King's army who knew that 
the work before it was not quite as easy as was anticipated by 
the gay gentlemen who now for the first time saw 
Altie/s shots fired in earnest. The veteran Sir Jacob Astley 
prayer. breathed a simple prayer with uplifted eyes. "O

As usual, the foot was, on both sides, drawn up in the 
centre, with cavalry on either wing ; but on the side of the 

story about Falkland and Rupert to refer to an incident some weeks 
before the battle. 

' Warwick s Memoirs, 229. 



'*42 A RECKLESS CHARGE. 45 

Royalists the main body of horse was with Rupert on the 
right, whilst a smaller force, amongst which Forth had placed 
Arrange- himself, was Commanded by Wilmot on the left. In 
th™w&lt;: ^^°^^ °^ Wilmot, on the Parliamentary side, were three 
incomplete cavalry regiments, two of them under Sir 
Philip Stapleton and Sir William Balfour, the Scotsman who had 
been the gaoler of Strafford in the Tower ; whilst a third, 
under Lord Feilding, acted as a reserve. 

After a few cannon shots had been exchanged Rupert 
charged. Sweeping round, he fell upon the flank of the 
enemy's cavalry. He knew that there was treason in their 
Rupert's midst. Sir Faithful Fortescue, who had been brought 
charge. Qygj iroxa Ireland with his troop, had no heart in the 
Parliamentary cause, and had promised to desert it on the day 
of battle. At Rupert's approach he and his men wheeled 
round and joined in the attack upon their former comrades. 
Shaken by the unexpected desertion, the whole of the Parlia- 
mentary cavalry on that side turned and fled. Hurling them- 
selves in wild confusion upon the line of their own infantry, 
they broke up four whole regiments of foot, of which only a 
few scattered groups of resolute men rallied to take part in that 
da/s fight. Leaving the runaways on foot, as a prize of little 
worth, to scatter as best they might, Rupert and his followers 
dashed in hot pursuit after the flying horse, cutting down the 
fugitives, and even slaughtering some of Fortescue's men who 
had neglected to strip off the orange scarfs which marked them 
as the soldiers of Essex. Little recked Rupert how the battle 
fared behind him. It is possible that his men, unaccustomed 
to the discipline of war, were now out of hand, and that he 
could not have checked them even if he had wished to do so ; ' 
but there is no reason to suppose that he made any attempt to 
bring them to a halt. When Kineton was reached they found 
the streets blocked by the carts and carriages of Essex and his 
staff. Many of them fell to plundering, riding over the men 
and women who were standing in the street. Others continued

Letters, i, 10.

Lhe pursuit till they were stopped by Hampden's two regiments 
advancing along the road. 

The unchecked race of Rupert's horse was not the only 
error of the Royalist commanders. Wilmot's men gained the 
Wiiraot advantage on the left, driving Feilding's regiment 
RupCTt-- before them, and, like their comrades on the right, 
example. started in headlong pursuit.' So little were the 
ordinary duties of generalship attended to, that even the King's 
reserve of horse galloped off after Rupert. In this 
reserve of Tcserve was Charles's own bodyguard, composed 
'^°'^' of gentlemen who boasted that among them they 

could dispose of a rental of 100,000/. Annoyed at the epithet 
of ' the show troop,' conferred upon them by their less fortu- 
nate comrades, they begged to be allowed to follow Rupert, and 
in an evil hour for the cause which he served Sir John Byron, 
their commander, granted their request. 

The King's army was thus entirely deprived of the services 
of its cavalry, a loss which was then of far greater importance 
The King's than it would be at the present day. The musketeers, 
wSuf' ^^° supported their unwieldy weapons upon the 
cavalry. portable rcsts which formed part of their equipment, 
were indeed habituated to take refuge, when attacked, among 
the ranks of the pikemen ; but it was hard even for the best 
disciplined pikemen to resist on open ground a well-executed 
charge of cavalry, and a regiment of infantry was therefore 

' Wilmot's part in the battle is ignored by the Parliamentarians, but 
his later absence from the field shows that there is truth in the Royalist 
assertion that he was successful on the left. In Scotland it was reported 
' that Prince Rupert and Ruthven routed both the wings of the Parlia- 
ment. ' Bailli', ii. 56- Compare Spalding, iii. 200. As Feilding's regi- 
ment is not mentioned by the Parliamentary authorities as taking any 
further part in the battle, I have no doubt that his regiment was routed. 
The fact that the reserve was routed, and not the two regiments in front 
of it, makes it probable that Balfour and Stapleton must have slipped 
aside, possibly to take advantage of some movement of the enemy, and 
this view of the case is borne out by the statement of the Royalist authori- 
ties, that these regiments had never been charged, and were hidden in a 
comer of the field. The Parliamentary accounts conceal the whole affair 
in silence.

The Pariia- of Cavalry. Through the folly of the King's com- 
reserv?I&gt;f Hianders, the only horse left on the field — the two

on the Parliamentary side. 

At first it seemed to Essex that, in the crash and whirl of 
disaster, all hope of retrieving the day was gone. Snatching a

justified the anticipations which Cromwell had formed of a 
A Puritan Puritan soldiery. Amongst these were the Lord 
soldiery. Qcneral's own regiment, which had been raised in 
the Puritan county of Essex, and HoUes's regiment, which had 
been recruited in London, and was as noted for its Puritanism 
as for its courage.' Cromwell too, himself the very incar- 
nation of the Puritan spirit, was at the head of an unbroken 
troop of horse.^ It must have seemed to him as if his ideal of 
a Puritan army was already to some extent realised. " These 
were the men," said Strode, some days afterwards, " that were 
ignominiously reproached by the name of Roundheads, and 
by these Roundheads did God show Himself a most glorious 
God." 

The attack of the King's foot was met with a stubborn 
resistance. Balfour's horse, after routing two Royalist 
infantry regiments, found itself in presence of the enemy's 
cannon. Balfour called for spikes, but no spikes were at hand, 

' In a later pamphlet describing the fight at Brentford, HoUes's men 
are spoken of as ' those honest, religious soldiers.' 

" The charge of cowardice subsequently brought against Cromwell by 
Holies is easily refuted, as in the narrative of Fiennes, which received the 
approbation of Essex and the chief commanders (E. 126, 38), Cromwell 
is distinctly named as one of those ' who never stirred from their troops, 
but they and their troops fought to the last moment. ' In the letter, how- 
ever, which precedes the narrative, Captain Cromwell is represented as 
flying. Probably this is a mistake for Cromwell's eldest son Oliver, who 
was a cornet in Lord St. John's regiment, and, according to Clarendon, 
St. John was amongst the fugitives.

and, contenting himself with cutting the traces, he wheeled 
round to do further service. From the mass of Charles's 
The struggle infantry no more was to be feared. Its centre had 
on the field, jjggjj pierced through by Balfour's charge, and from 
that time its right, though it stood firm, took no further part 
in the combat.' Two regiments, indeed, took up a position 
round the cannon which Balfour had captured and abandoned, 
but they showed no signs of any disposition to advance. 

Charles himself could do nothing to improve the position 
of his troops. He could neither command an army nor suffer 
Charles's anyonc else to supersede him. Personal bravery of 
behaviour, jjjg passive kind, indeed, he invariably showed. 
When his men were preparing to descend the hill, he rode up 
and down encouraging them to fight. "Go in the name of 
God," he said to Lindsey, " and I'll lay my bones by yours.*' 
Before the battle began, at the earnest request of his officers, 
he retired to the top, of the hill. But he could not long beat 
to remain in a position of safety, and he was soon to be found 
amongst his troops, sharing in the common danger, and 
adjuring them to show mercy to such of their enemies as fell 
into their hands. To guide the issues of battle was not in 
his power, and Forth, brave soldier as he was, seems to have 
galloped off with Wilmot. Each regiment failed or prospered 
as it might. There was no attempt to organise the combined 
action of an army. 

It was this failure of organisation which was disastrous to 

Charles. The Royal Foot Guards — the King's Red Regiment, 

as they were sometimes called — were left unaided to

fight which followed, that they give no clear idea of the general tactics of

(E. 126, 24) that the regiments which saved the guns and were never put 
into disorder were on the right, though the narrative is by no means clear.

head of the regiment was its own colonel, the Earl of Lindsey, 
resolved to do a colonel's work if he was not permitted to do 
that of a general. Isolated on the field, these brave men beat 
back all attacks for a time ; but the odds were sorely against 
them. Their musketeers were driven in, and the pikemen, 
charged in flank and rear by Balfour's and Stapleton's horse, 
and pressed hard in front by two regiments of foot, broke their 
ranks at last. The combat became a butchery. Verney was 
struck down, and the standard was wrenched from his dying 
hand. Lindsey, mortally wounded, fell into the hands of the 
enemy, to die a prisoner on the following day. The ruin of 
the King's hopes appeared to be complete. Only two of his 
regiments maintained their position on the field. The Parlia- 
^^ mentary forces, flushed with victory, were already 

the Royalist advancing to the attack, when they were checked 

by the return of the hostile cavalry. The shades of 
night were gathering, and Essex felt disinclined to continue 
the struggle. On the other side there was an equal disinclin- 
ation to begin a fresh battle at such an hour. The horsemen 
were weary after their long pursuit, and the regiments had 
lost all cohesion as they straggled back man by man. Falk- 
land, indeed, thought it still possible to end the Civil War at a 
blow, and urged Wilmot to attempt a decisive charge. " My 
lord," was Wilmot's reply, "we have got the day, and let us 
live to enjoy the fruit thereof" Perhaps Falkland was right, 
but the fact that Rupert did not, on his side, order a renewal 
of the attack goes far to show that it had little chance of suc- 
cess. At all events, the growing darkness made one brave 

deed possible. Captain Smith, a Catholic ' officer

standard, picked up an orange scarf from the field 
and threw it over his shoulders.- Accompanied by one or two 
of his comrades similarly attired, he slipped in amongst the 
ranks of the enemy, and found the standard in the hands of 
Essex's secretary. Telling him that so great a prize was not 
fitly bestowed in the hands of a penman, he sna^fhed from

him the precious symbol. Protected by his scarf, Smith suc- 
ceeded in escaping hostile notice, and triumphantly laid the 
recovered standard at the feet of the King. Charles rewarded 
him with hearty thanks, and knighted him on the spot.' 

The two armies, separated by the darkness, watched through 
the long hours of the night under the nipping air of an early 
Oct. 24. frost, which staunched wounds which, but for this 
i^not'^'" healing pain, might easily have proved mortal. In

side to renew the battle. Essex had been reinforced by about 
4,000 fresh men, including Hampden's regiment, but his in- 
feriority in cavalry precluded all thought of an assault upon the 
hill. The Royalists, on the other hand, were conscious of 
the inferiority of their foot. The men shrank from a fresh 
experience of an encounter with Puritan valour. Charles, too, 
lost time by sending a messenger to offer pardon to such of his 
opponents as would lay down their arms — those only who had 
been proclaimed traitors being excluded from mercy. Of 
course no such proclamation was allowed to reach the ears of 
the soldiers. On the night of the 24th the Parliamentary army 

' The foregoing account of the battle cannot, of course, lay claim to 
absolute correctness, which is unattainable in any case, even when the 
witnesses are producible to be examined ; but it is founded on a careful 
comparison of the existing evidence. On the Royalist side we have, 
besides Clarendon's account, Warwick's and Bulstrode's memoirs, the 
narrative published in Carte's Original Letters (i. 9), the official state- 
ment, A Relation of the Battle (E. 126, 24), a letter of C. H. to Sancroft, 
printed in Ellis's Original Letters, Ser. II. iii 301, and another from a 
Royalist in London (Harl. MSS. 3,783, fol. 61). On the other side are 
Ludlow's Memoirs, the account given by Fiennes (E. 126, 38), that of 
Holies and his brothei officers (E. 124, 26), and that contained in the 
speeches of Lord Wharton and others (E. 124, 32). The story of Smith's 
exploit comes from Ludlow. In Britanrr.ica Viitutis Imago (E. 53, 10), 
written in 1644, after Smith's death, is a different story, said to be derived 
from Dugdale, in which the orange scarf disappears, and Smith is said to 
have put to flight six cuirassiers who were guarding the secretary. Smith 
is there said to have wounded the person carrying the standard, as well aa 
one of the SMdiers. For a discussion on the military position, see CoL

Parliamentary troops had there been that co-operation between 
infantry and cavalry whiiii distinguishes an army from a fighting

CHAPTER III. 

TURNHAM GREEN. 

During the days which had followed Charles's march froin 
Shrewsbury, London had been deeply agitated. As soon as it 
was known that the armies were engaged ' orders were given 
1612. by the Houses to close the shops, and to convey 
teken'in""^ into the City the King's youngest children, Henry 
London. ^nd EHzabcth,^ who had fallen into the power of 
Parliament when Charles left Whitehall. The pretext given 
out for the latter step was the necessity of providing for the 
safety of the children, though the Royalists shrewdly suspected 
that they were to be kept as hostages in the event of a suc- 
cessful attack upon Westminster. During the next few days 
rumours and counter-rumours filled the air. The first set of 
fugitives asserted that Essex had received a crushing defeat, 
and those who arrived later asserted that he had won a brilliant 
victory. Before long it was ascertained that the 
King was marching on without resistance. The 
spirit of the population of London rose with the danger. 
Armed men flocked in from the neighbouring counties. In 
addition to the chains which were now stretched across the 
streets, earthworks were thrown up to defend all the approaches, 
at which women and children laboured as heartily as the men.* 
The danger which had fired some with resolution awoke 
a longing for peace in the minds of others. It was now evident 
that unless Charles were to gain a decisive victory the war

would be prolonged for some time to come. Especially to the 
ThePe wealthy merchant and the wealthy landowner the 
party in the prospect of a loHg interruption of commerce, of 
plunderings in town and country, was appalling. 
In the City and in Parliament, above all in the House of 
Lords, a Peace-party was quickly formed. Amongst the Peers 
its most respectable member was the kindly Earl of Northum- 
Northum- berland, always anxious for a quiet life and always 
beriand. distrustful of cnthusiasts. The support of the dis-

broke, who, when the King's strength appeared to be growing 
in the summer months, had carried on a clandestine corre- 
spondence with Hyde, in which he offered his services 
unreservedly to Charles,' and who, when in the autumn the 
Parliament seemed likely to gain the upper hand, threw all the 
influence of his great wealth on the side of the Houses. Now 
that .it was not altogether improbable that the King might 
enter London in triumph, Pembroke's voice was raised loudly 
for an accommodation.^ 

On October 29 a proposal to reopen negotiations for peace 
was made in the House of Lords.^ Two days later Edmund

which an honourable compromise alone was possible. They 
longed for peace, but there was no intellectual basis of peace 
in their minds.

144-149) were written by Pembroke's son.

For the moment, however, Waller's proposal met with wide 
support. When Essex, who, with the broken remains of his 
Approval army, had returned to London, gave his approval, on

be accepted, all obstacles appeared to be removed. On

invitation to the Scots to enter England in order to suppress 
Newcastle's army. The admission of Catholics to its ranks, 
and the expected arrival of Danish troops in answer to the 
King's application made through Henderson and Cochrane, 
were held to constitute a danger sufficient to warrant an appeal 
to Scotland.'* 

The demand that the King should lower his standard before 
he was admitted to negotiation was thus tacitly abandoned. 
On the 3rd Sir Peter Killigrew was despatched to 
A safe-' request Charles to grant a safe-conduct to Commis-

Nov. 6. wishes. After two days he declared that one of the 
of causing Commissioners, Sir John Evelyn, being a pro- 
° ^^" claimed traitor, could not be admitted to his presence. 

As the fact was previously unknown, it was believed at West- 
minster that the 'proclamation of Evelyn's treason had been 
antedated, so as to serve as a pretext for postponing the 
opening of the negotiation till an attack had been made on the 
Nov. 7. City. Even the Lords took fire at Charles's answer,

intervene, negotiate, gave the assent which they had hitherto 
refused to the invitation to the Scots.^

The terror of Rupert's name did far more to 
quicken the ardour of the City than the eloquence of the 
Rupert's members of Parliament. It is true that he had been 
piundenngs. recently repulsed in an attempt to storm Windsol 
Castle, but it was not in his character of a soldier that he was 
most dreaded. It was his task to levy contributions and to seize 
forage and provisions. In the King's army such operations 
were not branded with the name of pillage ; but whatever may 
be the befitting language with which to characterise the pro- 
ceedings of Rupert's troopers, there can be little doubt that 
their work was done with no gentle hand.^ They had lately

Venetian i'l/5'5'. ) were compelled by the Kiflg to contribute ' a sosteni- 
mento delle militie sue, le quali, la cavalleria in particolare, si nutriscono 
per la maggior parte sopra il paese. ' Whitelocke's account of the proceed- 
ings of the soldiers at his own house may probably be taken as a fair 
s imple of the behaviour of the Royal troops : " Sir John Byron and his 
brothers commanded those horse, and gave orders that they should commit 
no insolence at my house, nor plunder my goods ; but soldiers are not 
easily governed against their plunder. They spent and consumed 100 load 
of com and hay, littered their horses with sheaves of good wheat. Divers 
writings of consequence and books that were left in my study, some of 
them they tore in pieces, others they burnt to light their tobacco, and 
some they carried away with them. They broke down my park pales, 
killed most of my deer, though rascal and carrion, and let out all the rest, 
only a tame young stag they carried away and presented to Prince Rupert, 
and my hounds, which were extraordinary good. They broke up all 
trunks, chests, and places, and where they found linen or any household 
stuff they took it away with them, and cutting the beds, let oat the 
feathers, and took away the ticks. They likewise carried away my coach 
and four good horses, and all mv saddle horses, and did all the mischief 
and spoil that malice and enmity could provoke barbarous mercenaries tQ 
commit." Whitelocke, 61,

seized several waggon loads of cloth, coming from Gloucester 
shire for sale in the London market. Lord Say's house, 
Broughton Castle, and Whitelocke's house, Fawley Court, had 
been plundered. In London few doubted that if Charles 
entered the City he would abandon it to be sacked by his 
soldiers. 

On the 9th the excess of danger produced a revival of the 
desire for peace. Sir John Evelyn begged that the King's 
Nov. 9. treatment of himself might not stand in the way of 
be'ent'to '° ^ negotiation. On this, permission was given to the 
the King. other Commissioners to wait on the King without 
him. As but little confidence was felt in the result of diplo- 
macy, Essex was ordered to take the field. That a better 
discipline might be observed under his command than the 
Royalist officers appeared to be able to enforce, he was 
directed to exercise martial law. The stringent requirements of 
the Petition of Right were thus set aside under the stress of 
war.' 

On the 10th Pym appeared at Guildhall to explain the 

spirit in which overtures had been made to the King. He said 

that the Houses hoped that, now that Charles had

would be more reasonable than he had been, and 
that Parliament would be well pleased to establish any peace 
which would secure their religion and liberty. Mere words, 
however, would not suffice. " To have printed liberties," said 
Pym, " and not to have liberties in truth and realities, is but to 
mock the kingdom." ^ 

When Charles replied to the petition of the Houses he

lord, and on the followmg mornmg he wrote once 
more to the Houses, informing them that he would be in thai 
town in the evening to hear what they had to say.^ 

Rupert lost no time in obeying the instructions which he 
had probably dictated. On the morning of the 1 2th he burst 
out of the mist which lay heavily on the low ground by the 
Nov. 12. river and fell upon HoUes's regiment, which had taken 
SteciTon "P ^ position in advance of Brentford. The men 
Brentford, fought worthily of the reputation which they had 
acquired at Edgehill ; but the odds against them were too 
great, and they were compelled to fall back on the town, where 
Brooke's regiment was quartered. Here the two regiments 
long maintained an unequal fight. Many were slain or cap- 
tured, many were driven into the river and drowned. At last 
Hampden arrived with fresh troops, but he could do no more 
than cover the retreat of the survivors. Rupert was left in 
possession of Brentford. Though the sentiments of many o.f 
the inhabitants were notoriously Royalist, Charles's soldiers 
made no distinction between friend and foe, and before night- 
fall they had thoroughly sacked the town.'

twice as numerous as his own. Its composition was, 
no doubt, heterogeneous. Soldiers who had borne 
the brunt of war at Edgehill stood shoulder to 
shoulder with new levies which had never seen an

cavalry, but as long as it stood on the defensive it was irre- 
sistible. Its spirit was undoubted. Even those whose voices 
had been raised for peace had no wish to see London given 
over to pillage. The fear which inspired the half-jesting sonnet 
in which Milton implored the Royalist captain or colonel who 
might find his way to Aldersgate Street to spare the poet's 
home, as Alexander had spared the house once inhabited by 
Pindar, nerved the arms of hundred of men who were perfectly 
incapable of writing sonnets. Even Holland and Northumber- 
land appeared in arms in defence of the City. '

extreme peril, if he had been in the presence of an enemy 
capable of profiting by his too rash advance. On the rear of 
It maintains ^^^ "S^t flank, KingstOH Bridge was guarded by 
a defensive a force of 3, COO Parliamentary troops, under Sir 
James Ramsay, and Essex was strongly urged to order 
Ramsay to fall on the King's rear. To this scheme the profes- 
sional officers who had served in the Netherlands or in Germany 
were strongly opposed, and Ramsay was finally directed to 
fall back on the south side of the Thames to London Bridge, 
in order to aid in the defence of the City. Later in the day 
Essex was prevailed on to despatch Hampden to Acton, with 
orders to sweep round Charles's army and to place it between 
two fires. The professional soldiers again interposed, and 
Hampden was recalled There was much complaint in the army 
at its enforced inaction, but grounds are not wanting which 
warrant the belief that the General's final conclusion was pro- 
bably the right one. A number of spectators had ridden out 
from London to enjoy the unwonted spectacle. Whenever 
their inexperience perceived signs of a forward movement in 
Charles's army, these holiday visitors galloped off to a safe 
distance, and it was observed that each successive flight was 
followed by disorder in the ranks. Was it likely that a force 
as yet so undisciplined would have retained its cohesion under 
the fierce charges of Rupert's horse, if he had caught it scat- 
tered and divided ? ' 

However this may have been, the King was far too weak 
to take the offensive with any prospect of success. In the 
afternoon, after a few cannon shots had been ex- 
drawfi^ changed, he drew off his men, and Brentford was 
Brentford reoccupicd by Essex. The Parliamentary troops 
reoccupied were at once surrounded by a hungry crowd, com- 
plaining that the Royalists had stripped them of 
everything. Fortunately the wives and sisters of the citizens 
who had stood to their arms on Turnham Green had not

been unmindful of their needs, and hundreds of waggons were 
already on the way laden with the dinners which, but for 
Charles's sudden irruption, would have been quietly consumed 
at home.' 

Charles, on his part, was able to claim some advantage. The 
Royalists of Kingston welcomed him, and gave him the com- 
mand of the first bridge above the City. At West- 
gains minster it was believed that he intended to make his

way mto Kent, where he had many partisans among 
EsseT '*' the gentry. Essex accordingly threw a bridge of boats 
£wge of across the Thames from Fulham to Putney, so as to 
the Thames' ^^ ^^^^ '•° transfer his army to the southern bank. 

Charles made no attempt to force his way eastwards, 
Oatiands. but took up his quarters at Oatlands, where he re- 
mained for a few days. 

Turnham Green was the Valmy of the English Civil War. 
That which seemed to Charles's admirers to be his triumphant 

march from Shrewsbury had been stopped in the 
impprtanc'e very Outskirts of London. The Parliamentary army 
inflicted on had not, it is true, achieved a victory, but it had gained 
the ing. j.j^g ^^^ reorganisation, so as to find some counter- 
poise for that invincible cavalry to which Essex had never yet 
been able to oppose a successful resistance. The check which 
Charles had suffered was the more important because it was no 
mere strategical defeat which had been inflicted on him. His 
conduct in ordering the attack upon Brentford whilst negotia- 
was his tions were pending was no doubt defensible on military 
attackSg" grounds. A victorious general is not usually expected 
Brentford to throw away the advantages of his position because 
worthy ? proposals have been made to treat, unless he has reason 
to believe that the terms offered to him will be such as he will be 
inclined to accept. Charles's error lay in forgetting that he was 
more than a victorious general. His only chance of permanent 
success lay in his being able to reconcile where Pym hitherto 
had been but able to divide. It is unnecessary to discuss 
whether Charles wished to make peace or not. The mere wish

to make peace with an unbeaten foe will always be followed by 
disappointment, unless it is accompanied by a clear perception 
of the strength of the cause for which he is contending. 

The King's advance to Brentford after his acceptance of the 

offer of Parliament to negotiate was strongly resented at West-

summer of 1641. Then members agreeing politically had been 
found opposing one another on ecclesiastical subjects. Now 
members who were agreed on ecclesiastical subjects differed 
politically. Pym would have no peace which did not bring with it 
Charles's complete submission to the directing power of Parlia- 
ment and to a Puritan church. Holies and his friends would 
have made concessions to Charles's claims to rule the State, but 
they expected him to abandon his own ideal of church govern- 
ment. As there was not the slightest chance that he would ever 
do anything of the kind, they did but beat the air. 

Behind the controversy on the question of principle arose a 
controversy on the question of confidence. The Peace-party, 
like the Cavalier-party in. the autumn of 1641, was inchned 
to trust the King to do what they thought he ought to do. 
Opinion Py™ ^'^^ ^ deep distrust of the military element 
of Pym. around the King. He proposed that both armies 
should be disbanded. King and Parliament would thus be left 
face to face with one another, to come to terms as best they 
might. Which of the two he expected to gain the upper hand 
is evident from his asking that the Parliamentary proceedings 
against delinquents should take their course, and that both 
armies, before they broke up, should be bound by an oath to 
accept the terms upon which King and Parliament should agree. 
Stapleton followed with an attack upon the King's present ad- 
visers. " The principal men about him," he said, " are Digby, 
Percy, and men of fortune,' which how desirous they are of 
peace all men know." When the turn of Holies came to speak, 
Opinion of i' was found that he was ready to ask the King to 
Holies. accept, in church matters, the conclusions to which 
Parliament should come, upon the advice of the assembly of 
divines, and to allow the punishment of such persons as had 
been impeached before the outbreak of the troubles.* 

' That is to say, ' adventurers. ' We still say ' soldiers of fortune ' in 
this sense.

about the proposal to disband the army being attacked by ' Strode, 
Marten, and other violent spirits,' but gives no hint that it was supported 
by Pym. D'Ewes is now too much of a party man to be trusted.

If these were the demands of the Peace-party, they aftbrded 
no more reasonable hope of winning Charles's assent than the 
proposals of their opponents. In the end it was voted 
Demands of that thc King should be asked to return to his Par- 
liament to settle liberty and religion, and to abandon

The answer thus prepared was despatched to Reading.

by Charles. He had no longer any reason for re-

main obstacle in Essex's way, however, was that he was unable 
to pay his soldiers. Unless the Commons could provide a 
continuous supply of money, nothing vigorous could be done. 

The Commons knew that voluntary loans would sufiSce no 
longer. Even the farce of appealing to the good-will of citi-

might say about the powers of the Houses to levy taxes with- 
out an Act of Parliament to which the Royal assent had been 
given, it was plain that without taxation the war could not be 
carried on. Nor must this taxation be alloflred to fall on 
London alone. On the 2Sth Pym, together with Lord 
Mandeville, who had just become Earl of Manchester by his 
father's death, was despatched by Parliament to the city to 
announce the resolution which had been taken. As the 
burden is universal, said Pym, the aid must be universal too.' 

The moment for the appeal was well chosen. Not many

retreat from Turnham Green was known in Holland^could 
surely spare men enough to invade Kent. London would thus 
be blocked up and isolated. If it did not at once surrender, 
it would be easy to induce the King of France to lend three 
regiments of his Majesty's subjects which were in his service.*

duct, however, was no less technically illegal than

CHAPTER IV. 

THE CRY FOR PEACE. 

In Strengthening his position at Oxford Charles was not 
merely aiming at security from attack. Having had the 
1642. advantage of taking the initiative in the campaign 
^rate^kfi* which ended at Turnham Green, he had now the 
p'an- advantage of a complete strategical plan of operations 

for the campaign which he was now about to open. The at- 
tempt to penetrate to the heart of the enemy's position having 
failed, he resolved to substitute for it a scheme by which the 
enemy was to be surrounded and overwhelmed. He was him- 
self to hold Essex in check from Oxford, whilst Newcastle 
pushed on at the head of the Northern army through the Mid- 
lands into Essex, and Hopton advanced from Cornwall to 
make his way through the southern counties into Kent. When 
these two armies had seized upon the banks of the Thames 
below London, they would find no difficulty in stoppirig the 
passage of shipping on the river, and, by the annihilation of its 
commerce, the great city, and with it the Parliamentary army, 
would be starved into submission.' 

Though no evidence exists on the point, it is not altogether 
unlikely that the scheme originated with the Prince of Orange, 
as the first indication of it is to be found in a letter from some- 
one in the confidence of the Queen during her residence in 
Holland. If so it is not unlikely that it secured the appro- 
bation of Rupert, as he was always sensitive to the importarice 

' .This, which is substantially the plan revealed in the letter referred 
to at p. 64, was communicated by Charles's agent Heme to the Venetian 
ambassador. Agostini to the Doge, Jan. |2, 1643. Venetian Transcripts,

of gaining London. It is hardly probable that it was suggested 
by the Lord General of the King's army, the Earl of Forth. 
The Earl Though it is truc that he had been trained to war on 
of Forth. a great scale, it is difficult "to believe that if his brain 
had been the source of the King's plan of campaign, he would 
not have made a greater impression on his contemporaries than 
he did. The plan, wherever it originated, had indeed the in- 
herent weakness of directing a convergent attack upon a central 
position, from which the enemy, if he took the offensive vigor- 
ously, might crush the Royal armies in detail. No strategy, 
however, could alter the fact that the position of London was 
a central one, and at all events those who now held that 
city had as yet shown no indication of the power of taking the 
initiative. 

It was not, however, merely on its strategical weakness that 
the Royalist plan might possibly be wrecked. For any oppor- 
Strength of tunity of bringing together fresh armies both sides 
local feeling, -yyould have to depend upon the local organisation of 
the counties, and upon an appeal to the spirit of the local popu- 
lations. Even in the East and South of the country, where 
Parliament was supreme, the local feeling in the counties was 
far stronger than it is at present. In the North and West, 
ofhere Charles found his most devoted adherents, it was in 
almost exclusive possession. Geographical considerations, too, 
were hkely to tell against the King. The deep indentations of 
the western coast especially hindered the growth of common 
patriotism, and the men of Cornwall, of Wales, and of Lan- 
cashire were therefore not united in feeling as were the in- 
habitants of Kent and Sussex with those of Suffolk or North- 
amptonshire. 

The dangers likely to arise from the strength of local feeling 
were as yet unsuspected on either side. In Cornwall, Hopton 
had for some time gained the upper hand. Before 
Hopton in he was ready to assume the aggressive the initiative 
had been taken by the few gentlemen in the county 
who had joined the Parliamentary side, and who formed the 
Parliamentary committee at Launceston. Fancying themselves 
powerful because they were unmolested, they prepared to indict 



r642 PROCEEDINGS IN CORNWALL. 69 

Hopton and his supportsrs at the quarter sessions at Lostwithiel 
as disturbers of the peace. Much to their surprise, upon their 
arrival in that town Hopton confronted them, bearing in his 
hand the commission which he had received from Hertford 
as Lieutenant-General of the Horse in the West, and calling 
upon all men to submit to the authority which, in virtue of that 
commission, he derived from the King. Puritanism had but 
little hold upon Cornishmen, and the majority of the popula- 
tion were as opposed as were the gentry to any innovations in 
the services of the Church. There was, no doubt, too, some- 
thing of local patriotism in the prevailing dislike of religious 
changes to which Devonshire had submitted. Hopton accord- 
ingly now turned the tables on his adversaries. Not only was 
he acquitted of wrong-doing, but he persuaded the grand Jury 
to declare the gentlemen at Launceston guilty of promoting a 
riotous assembly, upon which the sheriif was authorised to call 
out the forces of the county against them.' 

Of all Hopton's supporters none threw himself more ener- 
getically into the cause than Sir Bevil Grenvile, the friend of 
sir'Bevii EHot, the descendant, as family tradition boasted, of 
Grenvile. Rolf, the sca-king who conquered Normandy, and the 
grandson of that Sir Richard Grenvile who had perished in the 
Revenge. Grenvile was a type of all that was noblest in the re- 
sistance to a Puritan domination. " I cannot contain myself 
within doors," wrote this brave and tender-hearted gentleman to 
a friend, who begged him not to endanger his family by the course 
which he was taking, " when the King of England's standard 
waves in the field upon so just an occasion ; the cause being 
such as must make all those that die in it little inferior to martyrs. 
I am not without consideration, as you lovingly advise, of my 
wife and family ; and, as for her, must acknowledge she hath 
ever drawn so evenly in the yoke with me, as she hath never 
pressed before or hung behind me, nor ever opposed or resisted 
my will ; and yet, truly, I have not in this or anything else en- 
deavoured to walk in any way of power with her but of reason j 
and though her love will submit to either, yet, truly, my respect

i642 THE MASTERSHIP OF THE ROLLS. &gt;3 

In every direction the bound* of legality were being over- 
stepped, and each party had a sharp eye for the transgressions 
of the other.' On the side of the King there was always the 
charge of rebellion to fall back on. Amongst the prisoners 
■Q^ g taken at Brentford was John Lilburne. On Decem- 
Xiibume bcr 6 he was indicted for treason before Heath, who 

found guilty , , , 

of high had recently been made Chief Justice of the Kmg's 
Bench. Lilburne, who was never at a loss for an 
argument, boldly denied that he had waged war against the 
King. He had taken arms to save his Majesty from evil coun- 
sellors. The jury refused to take this view of his case, and 
brought in a verdict of guilty. The judge sentenced him to 
death, and he would inevitably have been hanged if the Houses 
had not. intervened with an energetic declaration that, if any of 
their soldiers were put to death, they would inflict the same 
punishment on all prisoners who might fall into their hands.^ 

A similar collision arose on the King's appointment to of-

take part in the appointment of anyone else, it was some little 

time before Lenthall gained possession of the post ■ which he 

coveted.' 

Not a few of the members took umbrage at these breaches of 

constitutional propriety ; but common sense was on the side of

The question of immediate importance was not whether the

den imposed by them created a determined resistance, the King 
would have gained more than if he had won a victory in the

In the City of London the opposition to the new Parlia- 
mentary taxation assumed alarming proportions. Many of the 
wealthy merchants were Royalists at heart, and threw 
The upon Parliament the blame of a war which was dis- 

party in turbing trade. Some of them vowed that, sooner than 

"^' pay the tax, they would abandon business.' The 
hard times, bringing with them a loss of employment, made the 
war unpalatable to the lower classes. A petition was numer-

against the that danger was feared. Lord Herbert, the son of 
at o ics. |.jjg Marquis of Worcester, was raising a fresh army of 
Welshmen, in addition to that serving under Hertford, and as 
he was a Catholic, and had many Catholics in the army, his

1642 THE ASSQCiATIONS. 77 

Something more than the addition of a few Scottish recruits 
to the army of Essex was needed if Charles's growing strength 
j^^i was to be kept at bay. Hitherto, outside those 

nisatiou districts in which the King was present in person, 

needed. , .^ 11,-1 » . 1.1 , , , 

the Houses had rehed on somethmg hke the old 
county organisation, by placing authority in the hands of com- 
mittees of the leading Puritan gentry in each shire. The 
arrangement had not worked well. The counties were too 
small to form the unit of the military system, and the plans of 
the committees were often liable to be thrown out of gear by 
the royalism of large numbers of the resident gentry. Hence 
a scheme had for some time been under discussion for the 
formation of associations comprising several neighbouring 
counties, so as to combine into active resistance the scattered 
elements of the Parliamentary party over a considerable extent 
of country. On December 15 an ordinance was passed for an 

Dec. IS. association of the midland counties, and this was 
Und^M- followed on the 20th by another ordinance for an 
ciation. association of the eastern counties. The first com-

Huntingdon j the second those of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, 
Cambridge, and Hertford. Stamford's son. Lord Grey of 
Groby, was appointed commander of the Midland Association, 
whilst the command of the Eastern Association, as yet removed 
from the perils of war, was left undetermined. On the 31st 

Dec. 31. Warwickshire and Staffordshire were associated under

ment in administrative machinery. Each association would 
stand or fall in proportion to its ability to find a capable man 
to place at its head. 

The necessity for increased organisation was brought home 
to the Houses by the progress of the war in the South and 
West. It is true that on December 13th Waller recovered

Progress of but,' whilst Parliament was gaining ground in Sussex

and West, jn the City the new taxation had stirred up the 
bitterest feeling. Though on one pretext or another the 
chief promoters of the Royalist petition had been thrown into 
prison, their followers had not been cowed. On the 19th their 
petition was presented to the Lords by a chosen 
The^city'' deputation, the numbers of which were not suf- 
petuions. flciently great to inspire alarm. It was followed by 
another petition which was presented in the name of the Lord 
Mayor and the Common Council, and which was accompanied 
by a copy of the petition which the Corporation of the City 
proposed to send to the King, inviting him to return, and 
assuring him that strict precautions should be taken against a 
repetition of the tumults of the preceding winter.' 

The next day the Lords sent down the propositions which 
they had drawii up to be submitted to the King. Charles was 
^ to be asked to bind himself to pass all such Bills as 

The Lords' should be approved of by Parliament after consulta- 
propositions. ^.^^ ^j^j^ ^^ future assembly of divines ; to allow

liament ; to give the Royal assent to Bills for securing the pay- 
ment of the Parliamentary debt ; and to agree that all acts of 
the Privy Council should be signed by those who had advised 
them.^ There was also to be a new Militia Bill, and Charles 
was to be asked to reinstate Northumberland as Lord High 
Admiral. 

Such were the propositions suggested by that House iri 
which the Peace-party was predominant. They asked for 
ministerial responsibility and for a Puritan settlement of the 
Church — for all those concessions, in short, to which both

Charles and his partisans were most bitterly hostile. No 
wonder that those who kept their heads clear in the Commons 
thought it useless to engage in a negotiation on such 
They are ' tcrms. Vane led the way by asking the House to 
ty the ' refuse even to take them into consideration. If 
Commons, parliament began to treat with the King, it would 
grow careless of its own defence ; but the arguments of reason 
were borne down by the strength of the feelings enlisted in the 
cause of peace. To these feelings D'Ewes, with his imperturb- 
able reliance upon phrases, gave expression. After repeating 
Pym's suggestion ' that Charles's experience of the evils of war 
might make him more ready to treat than he had formerly 
been, D'Ewes asked his brother members how they expected 
to make head against the overwhelming forces in the field 
against them. The whole land was in confusion. No man 
would pay his rent. As the House had passed an ordinance 
to tax the subjects, it would be well to pass another to compel 
tenants to pay their rents. Poverty and famine were hastening 
upon them with winged feet. They were in danger lest the two 
armies might combine to make peace impossible. It would 
soon be a crime to be rich. D'Ewes sat down amidst loud 
applause, and the House voted that negotiations should be 
opened with the King.^ 

All the world, wrote one of Charles's partisans, was in 
favour of peace.* Those Lords who were understood to

' The Verney correspondence presents the most touching evidence of 
the entire absence of anything like bitterness of feeling in a large group of 
irien and women, amongst whom were warm partisans. The Royalist 
Edmund Verney, complaining to his brother that he had not received an 
answer to the letter of which an extract has been given at p. 5, writes as 
follows: " Although I would willingly lose my right hand that you had 
gone the other way, yet I will never consent that this dispute shall make a 
quartet between us. There be too many to fight with besides ourselves. 
I pray God grant a sudden and firm peace, that we may safely meet in

desire for took up the Cry, and called out " Peace ! peace ! " as 
'"''"■ loudly as anyone in the crowd.' In the Commons 

the Peace-party numbered Holies and Whitelocke, Selden 
and Maynard, amongst its members. It had the good 
, wishes of the vast majority of the nation, yet, for 
the Peace- all that, it was from the first predestined to failure, 
pa y. There was not the smallest reason to suppose either 

that the terms which the Houses now offered would ever be 
accepted by the King, or that they would themselves be ready 
to accept any terms which the King was likely to propose. 

It was this very impossibility of discovering terms of agree- 
ment which constituted Pym's strength. From the point of 
The War- ^'^w at which the man of the nineteenth century 
party- stands, it is easy to criticise his conduct severely. 

He and his followers, it may be thought, should have had more 
liberal views of ecclesiastical toleration, and should have been 
more ready to acknowledge that their adversaries who sur- 
rounded Charles at Oxford were fighting, as well as themselves, 
for conscience' sake. But it was not in the men of the first 
half of the seventeenth century to think anything of the kind. 
It was the tradition handed down from former generations, 
and held as firmly by those who were crying for peace as by 
those who were opposed to all negotiation, that there could be 
but one religion openly professed in the land. That which dis- 
tinguished the War-party was its clear perception of the fact that, 
if the religion of England was to be Puritan, that object could only 
be attained by the sword. It was worse than waste of time, it 
was a slackening of the energies of the supporters of the Par- 
liament, to attempt to establish Puritanism in England by 
negotiation with the King. Behind the question of what the

King iriiglit be persuaded to grant lay the question of personal- 
confidence in his word. "The distrust of the few at the,

to be smoothed away. No one has so much eloquence as to 
persuade them to show confidence." ' • 

■Yet in spite of every objection the cry for peace was too 

strong to be resisted. On December 26, the Commons

No time was lost by the friends of peace. On

oHihe City '^'^ agents of the City arrived at Oxford with the 
'at Oxford, petition of the Common Council, in which Charles 
Vvas assured of protection if he chose to return to West- 
minster. At Oxford they found themselves in the midst of 
a population which might have been friendly a few months 
before,^ but which was now dominated by the influx of Cava- 
liers. They were hooted as they passed through the streets, 
and it was with difficulty that they were preserved from actual 
violence. When at last they were admitted to the royal pre- 
sence, Charles told them that he was glad of their coming, as 
he wished them to distribute amongst their fellow-citizens his 
declarations, which had hitherto been kept from their know- 
ledge. On the 4th the agents were dismissed with

he wished as many as possible to be disabused and to. know

date, was once more amongst them at Westminster.''

After this Pym, who, together with other members of both 

Houses, was present in Guildhall, had no difficulty in con-

Pym was undoubtedly right in supposing that Charles had 
no serious thoughts of accepting a compromise. Heme, who 
The King's brought the royal answer from Oxford, assured the 
intentions. Venetian agent that Charles did not intend to give 
up a single point of his authority. In March he would have 
40,000 men in the field. With these he would block the 
traffic of the Thames and force the citizens to throw off the 
existing government.^ 

If the war was to be carried on, the old difficulty of obtain- 
ing money must be resolutely faced. The taxation which had 
, been ordered produced little. The farrhers of the

The farmers customs had positively refused to lend. They

Newcastle was now placed alongside of that of Digby in the 
worse category, although no charge had been brought against 
him iDcfore the fatal date. Charles was to be asked to agree to 
the disbandment of both armies before negotiations could be

Newark ^'"^ J°'^'* Digby for the King ; and though an at-

Newark made it easy to send supplies to Oxford. 
Yet before Newcastle could advance in person he was anxious 
-. to make himself completely master of the West 

SaViie'in the Riding. The clothing towns of that district, cut off 
' '"^ from succour by the retreat of the Fairfaxes behind 
the Ouse, were hard pressed. Strafford's nephew, Sir William 
Savile, dowered with something of his uncle's haughty and un-

CHAPTER V. 

THE TREATY OF OXFORD. 

On February i the peace propositions, so carefully elaborated' 
at Westminster, were laid before the King by the Commis- 
^643. sioners appointed by the Houses. Amongst them 
The pro'' ^^^ Waller, who had long been secretly working for 
positions him. " Thoueh you are the last,'' cried Charles as 

presented o j 

to the King, jjc caught Sight of the poet, " yet you are not the 
Waller's worst, nor the least in my favour." Whert, after 

welcome. ' ■ j ■ ^ 

Charles's ^^^ indiscrect speech, Northumberland began to 
the'&amp;m."' '■^^'^ the propositions, he was continually interrupted 
ndssioners. by the King.' As far as words went Charles did 
not cast off all hope of an accommodation, if reasonable con- 
cessions were made to him. " They that principally contrived 
and penned them," he said of the proposals which had been 
brought before him, "had no thoughts of peace in their 
hearts, but to make things worse and worse. Yet I shall do 
my part, and take as much honey out of the gall as I can." ^ 
In a letter to Ormond he expressed his real mind, 
fjis reili " " Certainly," he wrote, " no less power than His who 
opinion. made the world. of nothing can draw peace out of 
these articles." •'' 

Charles was a good critic but a bad . statesman. The 
counter-proposals which he offered showed that he had made 
no .effort to look for hoiiey to be taken out of the 
His counter- gall. He began by calling on hi« opponents to re- 
proposa s. gj-Qjg, ^q him his revenue, his forts, and his ships, to 
recall all thd declarations which they had issued in contravention 

' Whitelocke, 67; ' L.J. v. 590.

of the known laws of the land and of his own legal power, 
and to disclaim all right to imprison or to tax his subjects. 
Parliament was also to prepare a Bill which would preserve the 
Book of Common Prayer from the scorn and violence of the 
Brownists, Anabaptists, and other sectaries, in which he would 
be glad to see inserted a clause for the ease of tender con- 
sciences in accordance with his former declarations. All 
persons excepted from the general pardon were to be tried by 
their peers. Instead of the disbandment of both armies pro- 
posed by the Houses there was to be a cessation of hostilities 
during the negotiations, and there was to be freedom of trade 
between those who lived in the respective quarters of the 
Royal and the Parliamentary armies.' 

After this reply no wise man could entertain any hopes of 
peace. Even the hint thrown out about tender consciences 
was too vaguely worded,' and was too unappropriate to a con- 
dition of things in which two religious parties were struggling 
on equal terms for the mastery, to produce the slightest effect. 
Anxious as the Lords were to proceed with the negotiation, 
Feb. 7. they felt that they could only do so by dropping out 
votea°ces^- "^ ^'S^t for a time the question of principle which

° In his declaration published after his reception of the Grand Remon- 
strance, Charles expressed himself in the following way : " For differences 
amongst ourselves, for matters indifferent in their own nature concerning 
religion, we shall, in tenderness to any number of our loving subjects, very, 
willingly comply with the advice of our Parliament that some law may be 
made for the exemption of tender consciences from punishment or prosecu- 
tion for such ceremonies, and in such cases which, by the judgment of 
most men, are held to be matters indifferent, and of some to be absolutely 
unlawful ; provided this can be attempted and pursued with that modesty, 
temper, and submission that, in the meantime, the peace and quiet of the 
kingdon. be not disturbed, the decency and comeliness of God's service 
discountenanced, nor the pious, sober, and devout actions of those reverend 
persons, who were the first labourers in the blessed Reformation, or al 
that time, be scandalled and defamed." Husbands' Collections, 21. 



i643 A STRUGGLE AT WESTMINSTER. 91 

followed by a diplomatic struggle which might lead to a 
general disbandment of the armies. 

To the men who had hitherto disposed of the majority of 
the Commons this resolution of the Lords appeared to be a 
Feb. 8. ruinous concession. A cessation of arms, they be- 
Si?Coli-" lieved, would be altogether in the King's favour. The 
mons. King was levying monthly contributions wherever his 

Financial ^^mics had the upper hand, and, whether from loy- 
difficuities. alty or fear, those contributions were duly paid. On 
the other hand Sir Gilbert Gerard, the Parliamentary Treasurer 
of the Army, had lately announced that he had not a penny left 
with which to pay the troops, and that it was absolutely neces- 
sary to establish that regular taxation about which so much had 
been said and so little done. Since this revelation, a commit- 
tee had been sitting to devise an expedient ; ' but it needed 
but little sagacity to perceive that, if hostilities were suspended 
it would be more than ever difficult to induce even the warm 
est supporters of the Parliament to submit to taxation. Besides 
this, there was a strong conviction that delay would enable the 
King to gather from abroad those reinforcements which he was 
believed to be awaiting. 

On both sides every effort had been made to secure a full 
attendance in the Commons. The Peers had induced a con- 
Feb. 8. siderable number of members, who had long been 
dancefnThe absent from Westminster, to come up to vote for 
Commons, peacc. On the other hand, members, who were also 
officers, forsook for a time their military charges to raise their 
voices against the dangerous pursuit of a phantom.' The 
highest vote recorded during the month of January was 102. 
In the division taken on February 8 the numbers reached 194. 

Yet, after all, the parties thus marshalled against one another 
Debate "n ^^"^^ divided by no broad ground of principle. On 
the Com- both sides there was an agreement that the King's

be settled by the sword. He had too much confidence in his 
own cause not to believe that, if the arguments on which he 
relied were fairly heard, without the distraction caused by the 
presence of armed forces, they would bear down all opposition. 
He therefore asked that as soon as the armies had disappeared 
the propositions of the Houses should again be laid before the 
King, with such explanations as might seem necessary. When, 
after two days' debate, the vote was taken, it was found that, 
though there was a considerable minority which believed all 
diplomacy useless, the majority was for opening a negotiation 
on the subject of disbandment. On the loth and nth there 
Feb. II. was a discussion whether the Houses should offer to 
Sen'Tto' negotiate on the propositions themselves before the 
negotiation disbandmcnt had taken place. Pym distinctly re- 
fer peace. pHed in the negative. " If they yield not to a dis- 
banding," he said, " we shall have no hope of peace.'' Holies 
and Maynard must have known in their hearts that it was most 
unlikely that the King would yield at all, but they continued to 
hope against all probability. On a division, however, they were 
beaten, and the House resolved that the armies must be dis- 
banded before another step was taken. In all probability Pym 
and Hampden had voted with Holies on the 9th, and now voted 
against him.' 

There can be little doubt that the House had decided as 
rightly as it was possible for it to decide, unless it could rise 

into a higher atmosphere of thought. To conduct a

negotiation when the views entertained even by those

or pawning jewels, a sum which contemporary rumour, with 
probable exaggeration, reckoned at 2,000,000/. This time,

in every position in which she was placed, and she laughed 
heartily as her attendant ladies were driven by the howling of 
the wind and the creaking of the timbers to shout out, in con- 
fession to her chaplain, a catalogue of sins which was never 
meant to reach the ear of their mistress. " Comfort yourselves, 
my dears," she said, in unconscious imitation of the Red King ; 
" Queens of England are never drowned." ' 

At Oxford Charles was anxiously watching for news of the 
safe arrival of his wife, whose energy had served him so well. 

" Never woman with child," he wrote to Newcastle, 
Charles's " more longed for anything than we for news from 
anxie y. ygy " 2 Charles's longings were not immediately

aefin?''^ port, and some days passed before she was again able 

to put to sea, under Tromp's escort. 
On the 22 nd the Queen landed at Bridlington Quay. On 
the morning after she was awakened by the roar of guns. 

Four Parliamentary ships, under Captain Batten, 

were firing at the vessels which she had brought over, 
and which were still laden with warlike stores. The shot came 
Feb. 53. crashing through the houses of the little port. The 
It Bridir^g-'^ ^^^ ^f" which the Queen had passed the night was 
ton Quay, specially exposed to danger, in all probability not 
because Batten deliberately intended to injure her,^ but 
because it happened to be in the line of fire. Springing from 
bed, and hastily wrapping whatever first came to hand around 
her, she hurried out in search of a place of greater safety. On 
her way through the street she remembered that her lap-dog 
had been left behind, and in spite of the entreaties of her 
attendants she risked her life by returning to seek for it. 
Snatching up the little animal, she returned unhurt, and finally 
took refuge in a ditch outside the town, where she was under 
cover, though the bullets flew over her head or sprinkled 
her with dust as they struck the ground. At last a threat 
from Tromp and the fall of the tide compelled Batten to

from his wife as he had been warned that a conspiracy had been 
Alleged plot formed to seize her on her way from the coast, in 
against her: ^^^^^ ^^ deliver her to the Parliament to be held as 
a hostage. Newcastle arrested Lord Savile and Sir Thomas 
Gower on suspicion of complicity in the plot, whilst Lord New- 
port, who was charged with participation in it, sought safety in 
flight. As, however, Savile had no accusation made against him 
after he was brought to Oxford, and as Newport was attempting 
to make his way to the King when he was captured on the road 
by the Parliamentary troops, and was ultimately thrown into 
the Tower, there seems to be good reason to believe that both 
Savile and Newport were, at least on this occasion, guiltless.^ 

On the day on which the tidings of the Queen's entry into 
York reached Charles he received the articles of the proposed 

cessation at the hands of the Parliamentary Com- 
Articies of missioners. " Yesterday," he wrote to his wife on 
prSnTe'd to the followiug moming, " there were articles of a

In pursuance of the design which he announced to his 
wife Charles drew up the reply, which on March 6 he de- 
spatched to Westminster. He complained that the ■Houses 
March 6. had not granted freedom of trade during the cessation, 
r^epiy'tl°fhl ^"^^ ^e asked that the ships which had been sent out 
Houses. to defend the realm might be placed under ofiScers 
named by himself. Finally, he required that, during the 
cessation, no one should be imprisoned except in accordance 
with the known laws of the land.' 

These last words indicated something more than a benevo- 
lent desire to maintain the law. The City had lately responded 
to a fresh request for a Parliamentary loan by an 
Afresij ' offer of 60,000/. ; but its offer was accompanied by 
,Cityaoan. ^ request that the much-talked-of general taxation 
— the order of December 8 having been too vaguely worded to 
take effect^ — might be actually put in force. The wish thus 
expressed had already been met. On February 24 an ordinance 
was voted imposing a weekly payment upon every 
A general' county in England, and naming Commissioners who 
tax impose . ^^^^ j.^ assess the owners of property at their dis- 
cretion ; a scheme which seemed to be likely to be. more pro;- 
ductive than the levy of five per cent., which might easily lead 
to disputes'between the owners of property and the assessors. 
If every county had been amenable to the orders^ of Parlia&gt; 
%nent, the sum obtained would have exceeded i',6oo,ooo/.' 
Even half of this sum would have been no inconsiderable 
revenue. 

Charles was perfectly right in seeing that the difficulty of 
-enforcing payment of taxation would be a weak point in his 
Resistance Opponents' line of defence, and it was only natural 
10 taxation. ^^^ j^g should attempt to improve it to his own 
advantage, by suggesting that to imprison those who refused to 
pay the tax was as illegal as the tax itself. There were niany 
who believed a demand for money made by anything short of 
an Act of Parliament to be unjustifiable, and many more who

found it convenient to treat it as unjustifiable. The payment 
of the original five per cent, assessed upon London and West- 
minster ' had been widely refused. So dull was trade, and so 
exhausted were the citizens by the continual calls upon their 
purses, that it was difficult to find buyers for goods seized in 
default of payment, and at last the Jews of Amsterdam were 
invited to send agents to England to purchase what few 
Englishmen would buy.^ A beginning was thus made, and 
after a while money began to come in, though by no means in 
amounts equal to the expectations which had been formed by 
the promoters of the scheme.^ 

The situation was felt to be a serious one, all the more as 
the Parliamentary party had just suffered a considerable per- 

Feb. sonal loss. In the Midland counties the" King's 
^e King pause had been steadily gaining ground, and before

loss was the more severely felt at Westminster, as it open-ed 
the way for the southern march of Newcastle and the Queen. 

In looking for a man who might stem the tide of disaster 
the Houses lighted upon Lord Brooke. His position as owner 
Lord Brooke of Warwick Castle and his known staunchness to 
^ffwd- ^^ Parliamentary cause had led to his appointment 
shire. as commander of the recently associated counties of 

Warwick and Stafford, and he was now directed to take charge

attention of the garrison. A shot from the central tower 
pierced his brain and stretched him lifeless on the spot. The 
Royalists triumphantly recorded the fact that the assailant of 
the sacred precincts was slain on the festival of St. Chad, the 
patron saint of the Cathedral, and that the fatal shot was fired 
by ' dumb Dyott,' who, having been deaf and dumb from his 
birth, might be regarded as a special instrument of Providence. 
To his own party the loss was considerable. Those who were 
beginning to censure Essex as a dilatory commander were 
already casting their eyes on Brooke as a more energetic 
successor. In modern times he will be chiefly remembered 
as the author of that Discourse on Episcopacy which marks a 
step in the progress of the doctrine of toleration.^ Two days 

March 4. after his death the garrison of the Cathedral sur- 
dratfu^r'*"" rendered to Sir John Cell, who had brought up rein- 
renders. forcements from Derbyshire. Yet, in spite of the 
check thus inflicted on the Royalists, they continued to steal 
gradually southward, and houses were from time to time 
seized and garrisoned in unexpected quarters by the Cavalier 
gentry.^

Rupert's leaders captured, two of whom, named Yeomans and 
Bourchier, were ultimately executed. Rupert re- 
turned hastily to Oxford, and in face of his numerous cavalry 
Essex did not yet venture to stir.' 

Just at the time when Rupert's attempt and failure were 
known in London, the letter in which Charles assured the 
March 10. Queen that his only object in continuing the nego- 
rapted^'^" tiations was to undeceive the people was intercepted

satisfaction at the many ' fine designs ' offered to him caught 
the public ear, and for many a month, as one Royalist intrigue 
after another came to light, the newspapers took good care to 
remind their readers that it was one more of his Majesty's ' fine 
designs.' 

It was not by the Commons alone that Charles's answer of 
the 6th was regarded as unsatisfactory. To abandon 
alienated by the navy to him and to renounce the power of im- 
charies. prisoument was to surrender at discretion, and the 
Peers, long urgent for peace, now felt it to be hopeless, and 
threw in their lot with the party of resistance.^

there was no probability to the contrary but that his Majesty 
would readily accept them." ' 

The very equilibrancy, as D'Ewes termed it, of the new 
proposals was sufificient to set Charles against them. He was 
asked to entrust the forts and ships to persons nominated by 
himself on condition that they should possess the confidence 
March 23. ^^ Parliament.^ He first objected to the proposed 
Charles articles of cessation, and then, rejecting the com- 

cntxcises ' j j o 

thecessa- promisc of thc Houses, asked that the forts and

the fo?ts he had himself placed them before the outbreak of 
an s ips. j.jjg troubles, at the same time professing himself to 
be ready to remove his nominees if just cause should be shown 
for his so doing.^ As this arrangement w^ould place the Tower 
in the hands of Byron, Portsmouth in the hands of Goring, 
and Hull in the hands of Newcastle, even the warmest sup- 
porters of an understanding with the King must have felt that 
their hopes were at an end. 

Indeed, even before Charles's claim to the ships and forts 
was known at Westminster, it was generally recognised that the 
March 27. treaty would come to nothing. Lords and Commons

policy of confiscation, announced on September 6, and partially 
enforced on October 15,' was thus made generally applicable. 
D'Ewes, it is true, mourned over the fact that the ' fiery spirits ' 
were now as supreme over the Peers as they were over the 
Commons, and consoled himself with the remembrance that 
superiority of character was on the side of peace. In the 
Commons at least most of the men of great estates were on 
the side of an accommodation, whilst the supporters of Pym 
were ' mean or beggarly fellows,' who, having been mechanics, 
and being men of mean fortune, were therefore 'not so sen- 
sible of the destruction of the kingdom as those who had estates 
to lose.' It did not occur to D'Ewes to ask whether Charles's 
exorbitant demands had anything to do with the ascendency 
which Pym had now regained.^ 

Pym was bent on placing the Parliamentary finances on a 
sound basis. The tax of five per cent., the monthly contribu- 
March 28. tioHS, and the rents of sequestrated estates might per- 
posM an' "^^PS be sufficient if all England could be compelled

cise upon all commodities bought and sold. Such a proposal 
was certain to rouse the warmest opposition. If the incidence 
of an excise is not more oppressive than that of other taxes, it 
is at least more widely felt. A member rose to express his 
astonishment that a motion should be made in that House to 
revive a tax which, when the King had attempted to impose it 
in 1628, had been declared by the Commons to be destructive 
to trade. Pym then proposed to restrict the new tax to super- 
fluous commodities. One member after another refused to

There is an odd entry on fol. 338b to the effect that the Lords on March 
22 acquainted the Commons that they had sent to Oxford to ask the King 
for payment of the expenses of firing for the use of the King and Parlia- 
ment. If this means, as I suppose it does, the warming of the Houses at 
Westminster, it is not strange that the King would not pay.

such an unjust, scandalous, and destructive project.' Pym's 
motion was lost, but the time would come before long when 
it would be found necessary to adopt it.^ 

In spite of the rejection of Pym's project, the evident hope- 
lessness of an accommodation had given the War-party the 
March 30. ascendency in the Commons. On March 30 the 
Expulsion Commons, in the teeth of the opposition of the

amongst Pym's adherents in the Commons. 

By none was Charles's obstinacy felt, as its consequences 
developed themselves, more. than by those who, on either side, 
March 19. Were sincerely desirous of peace. On March 19 Roe 
dency of '^^^ poured his troubles into the sympathising ear of 
Sir T. Roe. Falkland. " If," he wrote, " you can agree the cessa- 
tion, which is the popular part, the articles will follow almost 
by necessity, and this rule only I will lay, that if you must or 
shall make war successfully, you must set peace in the first 
rank, you must show that she is ravished from you, and your 
arms are only employed to rescue the beloved of all men." 
Roe's subsequent letter of April 6 shows the effect 

^" ■ produced on him by the news of the King's demand 
for the ships and forts. "It may appear great presumption 
in me," he wrote, " to give any opinion either of the state of 
your treaty in hand or of your proceedings therein ; but if 
indignation could make a poet against nature, the passions of 
a troubled spirit may excuse any errors of a well-affected zeal.

pursued and grasped after the hopes of accommodation. They

pretend to have no ground nor subject left them to continue 
their endeavours. There is another party who triumph and 
proclaim that it is you that decline the peace by refusing the

vantageous to his Majesty, yet, considering the popularity of

perfect victory." ' 

At Westminster Holland spoke almost in the same language.

And of to some present mconvenience than to let sup this

natural and bloody war would be brought low in the esteem of 
all men, and ' his Majesty would then be restored ' to all his 
ancient and undoubted power and rights.' Holland sadly ac- 
knowledged that his counsel 'had been nothing at all regarded.'^ 
Charles, in fact, if he desired peace, desired it only on his own 
terms, and was entirely unconscious of the importance of win- 
ning the sympathy of his more moderate opponents. His eye 
was fixed on the progress of the military operations.

tained a superiority over Lord Derby, whilst the Hotharas in 
Hull and the Fairfaxes in the West Riding continued to hold 
their own against Newcastle. If the Parliamentarians held the 
broken circumference of a circle round the King, the Royalists 
held a still more broken circumference of an outer circle 
beyond. The efforts of the Royalists of this outer circle to 
overpower the resistance of the intermediate zone with a view 
to an ultimate advance on London, gave a kind of unity to 
those local and desultory combats which bewilder the historian. 

During the first fortnight of March Sir William Waller, who 
had been down to Gloucestershire to strengthen the position 
Sir w. which had been weakened by Stamford's march into 

Gioucest"r- Devonshire, had been engaged in making good his 
shire. footing. On the 15th he secured Bristol. Having 

reduced Malmesbury on the 21st, he threw himself on the 24th 
on Lord Herbert's Welshmen at Highnam, and dispersed or 
captured, all who escaped the sword.' 

Bristol and Gloucester having been thus secured, Waller 
assumed the offensive. Ross and Newnham, Monmouth and 
Chepstow fell into his hands ; but he did not venture 
He occupies to advaucc further westward. Not only was the 
and Chep- Welsh population hostile, but he learnt that Rupert's 
younger brother, Prince Maurice, had been sent 
from Oxford with Lord Grandison to fall upon his rear. Send- 
ing his foot and artillery across the estuary of the Severn, 
he passed through the enemy's lines, and slipped into Gloucester 
at the head of his cavalry. The places which he 
Returns to had occupied in Monmouthshire fell back into the 
hands of the Royalists. If Waller had not accom- 
plished all that he had hoped to do, he had at least secured the 
important district of which he was in charge. He had also 
shown that Parliament possessed a general whose wariness 
was united with that agility in which Essex, with all his sterling 
qualities, was terribly deficient. The name of 'William the 

' Mr. W. P. Price, in a letter addressed to the Gloucester Journal,

Conqueror,' which was now appHed to him, marked the estima- 
tion in which he was held.' 

In the North, Newcastle and the Queen were more suc- 
cessful than Herbert had been in the West. Money was sadly

Yorkshire. . . 

Its support. Amongst its commanders, too, there 
were some who had taken arms from political rather than from 
religious motives, and who therefore felt themselves ill at ease 
as the cause for which they fought showed itself as more dis- 
j^^^ ^ tinctly Puritan. Amongst these were Sir Hugh 
Sir Hugh ' Cholmley, the governor of Scarborough, and the 
°^^''' two Hothams. Of the three, Cholmley appears to 
have had the nobler nature, and to have been actuated by the 
purer motives. In the years of passive resistance he had 
refused to pay ship-money, and had been disgraced by 
Strafford. Like most of the Yorkshire country gentlemen he 
had nothing of the Puritan in him, and having taken service 
under Parliament in the belief that the war would soon lead 
to a constitutional compromise, he was bitterly disappointed at 
the failure of the Oxford negotiators to reach any basis of 
agreement. 

Whilst Cholmley's mind was in this state, the Queen 
invited him to a conference at York. He accepted the invita- 
tion, and returned to Scarborough resolved to embark in a 
treason which might easily assume in his eyes the character of 
loyalty to the sovereign whose castle he had been guarding 

against its true owner. On March 25 he informed 
Deseru ^'' the garrjsoH that from that time they were to hold 
mlnSy'*" the fortress for the King. Their apparent' acqui- 
'*"^=- escence lulled him into security. On March 31,

with 1,500 men, and Bushel was compelled to surrender the 
fortress which he had won.' 

The Hothams did not as yet follow Cholmley's example ; 
but they showed little interest in the Parliamentary cause, and 
April 2. did all that lay in their power to thwart the opera- 
faxes in"^' tions of Lord Fairfax and his son. The Fairfaxes, 
Leeds. ([jyg descrted, abandoned the country about Selby, 

and threw themselves — not without loss — into Leeds, where 
they were soon besieged.^ 

In proportion as Newcastle gained ground in Yorkshire it 
became necessary to hold out a hand to him from Oxford, to 
enable him, when his immediate task was accomplished, to 
make his way southwards. The loss of Lichfield had been 
felt by the Royalists as weakening the King's hold upon the 
Midlands, where it most concerned him to be strong. On 
the receipt of the news, therefore, Northampton had 
Northamp. been despatched from his station at Banbury to 
recover retake it. From a life of ease and luxury this 
wealthy nobleman had been roused by the outbreak 
of the war to throw himself heart and soul into the royal cause. 
In Warwickshire his name had been from the first a tower of

n'opton'^ forces on Hopton Heath, about two miles from 
Heath. Stafford. After a sharp conflict he drove the enemy 

before him ; but in the moment of victory, as he was charg- 
ing too far in advance, his horse was killed under him, and his 
helmet struck from his head. The Parliamentary soldiers who 
surrounded him offered him quarter. " I scorn," was the dis- 
dainful reply, " to take quarter from such bas^rogues as you are."

hands of the enemy, and, unless the constant asseveration of 
the Royalists is to be mistrusted, Gell and Brereton were so 
dead to all honourable feeling as to refuse to deliver it up to 
the slain nobleman's son, except in exchange for the guns and 
prisoners which had been captured by the Royalists.' 

Charles resolved to send Rupert to complete the work 
which had been interrupted by Northampton's death. On 
Aprils. April 3 the Prince reached Birmingham, then a 
Biimng*' Small town noted for its Puritanism and its iron- 
ham, work. When the Civil War broke out it threw 
itself with more than ordinary ardour into the Parliamentary 
cause. It furnished Essex with 15,000 sword-blades, and cast 
into prison two messengers who brought an order to forge 
weapons for the King. When Charles was on the march to 
Edgehill the men of Birmingham intercepted and carried off 
the plate which followed him. Though their town was an 
open one, they now refused to allow Rupert a 

''" '■ passage through it, and fired on the approaching 
troopers. After a brave resistance they were driven back, and 
the Royalists gained possession of the town. In spite of 
Rupert's order to spare the beaten foe, the place was sacked 
and many of the houses were set on fire. Twenty thou- 
sand pounds, it was said, would be insufficient to repair the 
damages. The Earl of Denbigh, the honest squire who had 
risen to fame as Buckingham's brother-in-law, and was now 
fighting in the Royalist ranks, was slain in the attack.^ 

As Rupert marched on loud cries reached him from dis- 
tressed RoyaUsts. Lady Derby implored him to hasten to the 
Rupert assistance of her husband, who was fighting an 
summoned unequal battle in Lancashire. Capel, who was 
North. maintaining the King's cause in Shropshire, urged 

him to advance against Brereton, who held almost all Che- 
shire for the Parliament. If Nantwich, he said, were taken,

Manchester would soon fall, 'and after that, between Oxford 
and Scotland, the King's affairs would have little impedi- 
ment.' ' 

Rupert struck for the nearest object. On April lo he laid 
siege to Lichfield Close and Cathedral.^ When that had fallen, 
and its resistance could hardly be prolonged, he 
Uchfieid would be able to hold out a hand to Derby and New- 
"°'°' castle, and to conduct to Charles the Queen and the 

military stores in her keeping. The resistance was, however, 
prolonged till the 21st, and when the Cathedral was at last 
surrendered Rupert's services were needed in the South. His 
scheme of a northern march had to be abandoned for the 
present. 

On April 8 the Houses refused to agree to a cessation on 
the King's terms, and required a positive answer to their original 
Aprils, demand for a disbandment.' On the 12th Charles 
S 'agree replied by asking, as he had asked before, that his 
•o^dis- ^ revenue, magazines, ships, and forts should be re- 
stored to him, and placed under the charge of the 
His finar' persons trusted by him, unless just and legal excep- 
"""^^ tions could be taken against them ; that all members 

of either House expelled since January 1642 should be restored ; 
and, finally, that, in order that Parliament might be secured 
against tumultuous assemblies, it should be adjourned to some 
place not less than twenty miles from London. From the Par 
liament thus reconstructed he expected Bills for punishing those 
who, in the press or in the pulpit, had used seditious language 
against himself or against the laws, and especially those who 
had justified the taking of arms against the King. To make 
these terms more acceptable he offered to throw over the Catho- 
lics, and to consent to a Bill for the better discovery and speedier 
conviction of recusants, as well as for the compulsory education 
of their children in the Protestant faith.* 

As a matter of course these proposals were rejected. On 
April 14 the Houses refused to accept them as a basis of

CHAPTER VI. 

IRISH AND SCOTCH MOVEMENTS. 

The paragraph relating to the Catholics in Charles's final reply 
was peculiarly disgraceful. In the hour of trouble he had 

1643. joyfully accepted their services, yet he was now ready 
Olitks's *° abandon them to their enemies at a moment 
treatment when hc was stickling for every jot of his own pre- 
Cathoiics. rogativc. 

The fact was that Charles, as was so often the case with him, 
was floating between two irreconcilable pohcies. The first, 
which was embodied in his message, was the policy 
policies. of Hyde, who had just been advanced to a seat in 
Hyde as a the Privy Council, and had been named Chancellor 
counsellor, ^f ^.j^g Exchequer in succession to Culpepper. The 
strict execution of the law of the land, in reUance on the support 
of a complete Parliament, which was to be freed by its removal 
to a distance from Westminster from the dictation of a London 
mob, was the groundwork of Hyde's system. If that system 
was very far from being all that the circumstances of the time 
demanded, it was at least straightforward and complete in it- 
self, whilst it appealed to the reverence for law and the reve- 
rence for Parliaments which are the most abiding characteristics 
of political Englishmen. 

With such principles Hyde had no objection to dabble in 
what ordinary men would speak of as plots and conspiracies. 
He could not understand that a trust imposed by the Houses 
at Westminster was binding upon the conscience at all. Those 
who, hke Cholmley, surrendered to the King fortified places 
which they had engaged to guard for Parliament were simply 
restoring to its legitimate owner property, of which, in a mo- 



1^43 CHARLES AND HYDE. in 

ment of weakness, they had accepted the charge at the hands 
of a gang of robbers. Whilst the negotiations were still in pro- 
gress preparations had been made at Oxford to secure a prize 
in comparison with which Scarborough Castle was as nothing. 
Charles knew that a large number of the inhabitants of London 
were anxious for peace, and he was ready to offer any assist- 
ance in his power to enable them to shake off the yoke of the 
usurpers. 

Accordingly, on March i6, Charles addressed to Sir Nicho- 
las Crisp and other citizens a commission of array, by which 
March 16. ^^^ wtie authorised to appoint officers and to select 
A com- from amongst their loyal fellow-citizens such as were

mission, however, was retamed at Oxford till an op- 
portunity should occur of conveying it safely to London. In 
the meanwhile the poet Waller undertook the completion of the 

„ . . , political arrangements, and offered to act as interme- 
Onginof J. , °, . . ' , , , , . , 

Waller's diary between the citizens and such members of either 

*" ° ■ House as might be ready to declare for the King on 

a fitting occasion.' That the correspondence between Oxford 

and London was to pass through the hands of Falkland is a 

sure indication that the plan had the concurrence of Hyde. 

In substance the policy of Hyde was the policy of Charles. 

The King was as indisposed as his adviser to make any real 

„^ , concession to those whom he regarded as actuated 

Charles con- , , , . ,^^ , , 

curs with by the basest motives. Of a broader, more genial 
^ '' statesmanship there was no thought with either. 

Where Charles stood apart from Hyde was in his willingness to 
accept aid from any quarter, and in his fond belief that men of 
every religious or political principle might be brought to sacri- 
fice themselves for him without exacting corresponding advan- 
, tages in return. He fancied especially that he could 

a policy of SO use the Catholics as to avail himself of their 
services, though he never intended to bind himself 
to them further than he was conveniently able to do. 

Hence arose a second policy, the details of which were 

' Staie Trials, iv. 628.

never communicated to Hyde, a policy which was certain to 

clash with the one which Charles ostensibly adopted. In a later 

generation it would be possible to be a convinced 

Charles and ° , , , . , ^ , ,■ 

theCatho- Protcstant and to support the claims of Catholics 
'"■ to complete religious liberty, but such breadth of 

judgment was hardly possible as yet, and Charles at least laid 
no claim to it. As far as England was concerned, the weak- 
ness of the Catholics was such as to make them well pleased 
with anything short of the worst treatment, but it was other- 
wise in Ireland, and it was to the Irish Catholics that Charles 
was now looking. As yet, indeed, he did not ask them for 
direct aid, but he hoped so to conciliate them as to enable 
him to bring- away from Ireland the English army which had 
been serving against them. On April 9, only three days before 
Charles announced his readiness to abandon the 
tations from CathoHcs of England to the cruelty of the law. Sir 
^ ' Nicholas Byron, writing by his direction, informed 
Capel ' that his Majesty did shortly expect succour from 
Ireland, which was for a time to be kept secret.' 

No doubt Charles wished to keep his project secret. 
Unless he could veil his Irish plans in darkness, it would be 
hard for him to secure the sympathy of any considerable 
section of the London citizens. Unluckily for him, Byron's 
letter was intercepted, and its contents were before long known 
at Westminster.^ 

For more than a year the Irish insurgents had been doing 
their best to come to an understanding with Charles. In 

i6ia. March 1642, just after they heard that he had given 
o«rturef ■ ^^^ ^sscnt to the Act of Confiscation,^ the Catholic 
land'"' gentry of the Pale despatched Colonel Reade to 
England as the bearer of their assurances of loyalty. 
Reade' The Unfortunate messenger fell into the hands of

the torture in the vain hope that he might be brought to 
acknowledge Charles's participation in the rebellion.' The

insurgents, however, knew that in the main they must depend 
on themselves and not on Charles. On the very day on which 
Thes^od Reade was stretched on the rack a synod of the 
clergy of the province of Armagh, meeting at Kells, 
called for an organisation which might give unity to the 

May. scattered forces of the insurrection.' In May an 
Kiik^'y.^' assembly in which the clergy took counsel with the

Council. It was then resolved to choose a Supreaie Council 
of nine members to act as a Provisional Government of revo- 
lutionary Ireland, on the understanding that a General 
Assembly, which would practically be an informal Parliament 
of the insurgent population, should meet as soon as possible." 

To the step thus taken the I.ords Justices replied, on May 
28, by prohibiting all intercourse with the Catholics. .On June 
June 21. 21, the House of Commons at Dublin, now a purely 
Sdudld sectional body, resolved that all persons refusing the 
Uubii'n* oath of supremacy should in future be debarred 
Parliament, from taking their seats, and expelled forty-one of its 
members as traitors.' The two religions were thus divided 
by a sharper line than ever, and in Ireland the division of 
■religion was nearly, if not quite, coincident with the division 
of race. 

Before the end of July the Catholics made another effort 

to lay their case before the King, requesting Ormond to 

forward their petition to him. Ormond, however,

to tell how far the late King and Queen were privy or concerned in the

There was no strategy on either side. It was an affair of 
skirmishes and sieges, of raids over the wide expanse of pasture 
Progress of land for the purpose of sweeping off the herds of

Wherever an English force could penetrate, its track was 
marked by fire and the gallows. Exasperated at the Ulster 
murders, and seeing in every Irishman a murderer or a sup- 
porter of murderers, the English soldiery rarely gave quarter, 
and, unless the accounts of their enemies are entirely devoid 
of truth, when they did give it it was often violated. The 
peasants retaliated by knocking stray soldiers on the head, and 
by slaughtering parties too weak to resist. Yet whenever in the 
summer of 1642 the Irish forces were commanded by officers 
of rank and authority, they were distinguished for humanity 
under circumstances of no slight provocation. The garrisons 
of fortified posts captured by the Irish were uniformly allowed 
to find their way in safety to a place of refuge.' On the whole 
the balance of advantage was on the Irish side. Seldom able 
to cope with the English in the field, and extremely deficient 
in artillery, they had been defeated in May by Ormond in a 
comparatively considerable engagement at Kilrush, and in 
several other encounters in different parts of the country. 
Numbers were, however, on their side, and the English troops, 
ill supplied with pay and depending on plunder for their sup- 
port, dwindled away, till garrison after garrison was compelled 
^ to surrender. In the course of the summer two

Ulster as its natural leader.*

In the course of September, therefore, the Lords Justices 
had but a dismal tale to recount. In the county of Limerick 
only one garrison held out. In the county of Cork only a few 
places, mainly on the coast, still made head against the enemy. 
Sept. 1. Further east, Waterford and Wexford were in the

Justices. port another Dunkirk, a nest of privateers darting 
forth to prey on English commerce. In Ulster, Monro, 
the rude soldier who had harried Strathbogie in 1640, had 
taken up his quarters at Carrickfergus ; but neither he nor the 
Earl of Leven, who arrived subsequently to take the command, 
was inclined to engage in any difficult military-undertaking. 
The English Parliament had promised to send money to support 
the Scottish army, but the outbreak of the war in England pre- 
vented it from fulfilling its obligations. After a short stay in 
Ireland Leven returned to his native country, leaving Monro 
behind him at the head of the troops as his major-general. 

'• Thus," wrote the Irish Council on September i, " are the

provisions should increase, and ours not so, in respect they 
have the wealth and natural commodities of the whole kingdom

being Papists, do the like. We on the other side have not the 
quiet use of any land in the kingdom, nor anything but what 
we fight for, out of the few towns we have." ' 

By the end of September the Irish Council were in some- 
what better spirits. Lord Lisle, the son of the Earl of Leicester, 

had been sent to Ireland at the head of 1,500 men. 
Lisie's'ex-' He had relieved Trim, and had marched by way of 
pc ition. g;eiis to Virginia. " He still proceeds " — such is the 
account given by the Government — " in burning, wasting, 
spoiling, and destroying all the country about him, and all the 

rebels' corn, hay, and turf, and depriving the rebels 
'^ ' ^'^' of all the cattle he can, so as to take from them all 
means of lodging, food, and fire ; which course, God willing, 
we to our power intend to hold in other parts, as knowing that 
nothing conduceth more certainly to the destruction of the 
rebels ; yet we see we shall be wonderfully disabled therein by 
those extremities of want under which we now suffer, and 
whereof we are in danger to be swallowed up, if not speedily 
supplied from thence, our want of powder and match being 
such and so great as we much fear the Lord Lisle will hardly 
have sufficient to retreat hither." ^ 

It is no wonder that a policy so desolating, and £it the same 
time so ineffectual, found some opposition in the ranks of the

tendencies of himself to be distrusted by the Lords Justices, or, to 
speak more plainly, by Sir William Parsons, who was 
the guiding spirit of the party of confiscation and destruction. 
He had many relatives engaged on the opposite side, and he 
knew Ireland too well not to wish to see all reasonable conces- 
sions made to the just complaints of the Catholic nobility and 
gentry. Even if he had not been bred up in the school of 
Strafford, he would have been drawn by his feelings as an 
Irish statesman to repose confidence in Charles, and to distrust 
the English Parliament, which treated Irish grievances with

The question of the attitude to be taken towards those 

whom the Dublin Government designated as rebels was grow- 

Oci. 24. '"S "^^"^^ pressing every day. On October 24, the 

Meedng rf day after the battle of Edgehill, the General Assembly 

Assembly at of the Confederate Catholics met at Kilkenny. Every 

^™^' county and every borough, not actually in the power 
of the enemy, had chosen its representatives. To all intents 
and purposes the body thus produced was a Parliament of the 
Irish nation, though it met in a single House, and though, 
out of respect for the King, it disclaimed the title of Parlia- 
ment for an Assembly which had not been summoned by his 
writs. 

The Assembly thus constituted proceeded to remodel the 
Supreme Council, which was thenceforward to consist of 

^ twenty-five members.^ Under it there was to be 

The a Provincial Council in each province, and a Council 

Supreme . « n i ^ -i 

Council m each county. All these Councils were to exercise 
rem e e . j^jjjj,j^j ^^ ^g]j ^g administrative functions. On the 
ecclesiastical question the Assembly pronounced a decided 
opinion. The Roman Catholic Church was to re-enter upon 
its rights, and the Roman Catholic bishops and clergy were to 
be held as the true possessors of all ecclesiastical property, 
though, much to the disappointment of the monks, abbey lands 
were not to be restored by the lay impropriators, many of whom 
were sitting in the Assembly itself. Whether the Protestants 
in Ireland were to be allowed liberty of religion was a point on

which the Assembly did not touch, and which it perhaps re- 
served for future negotiation. On the land question the 
Assembly was equally reserved. On the one hand, it refused 
to acknowledge the results of popular violence. Land was to be 
held to be the property of him who had possessed it on October i, 
1641. Where, however, the owner was an enemy or a neutral, 
his rents were to be sequestered for the promotion of the 
public cause. 1 It is, however, impossible to doubt that, if the 
efforts of the Assembly had been crowned with success, it 
would have found itself powerless to reinstate the English and 
Scottish colonists on the lands which they had recently lost, 
and it is not very probable that Catholic Ireland would have 
granted to Protestants a toleration which was denied to Epis- 
copalians in Presbyterian Scotland, and had lately, when 
Charles's authority was supreme, been denied to Presbyterians 
in Episcopalian England. 

" Irishmen, unanimous for God, the King, and the country," 
was the motto chosen for the seal of the confederate Catholics.^ 
Unless the unwonted unanimity of Irishmen could 
of the con- be preserved, the Assembly would hardly succeed in 
= s"^ ^=- carrying out the work which it had undertaken, and 
there were already signs that the unanimity which ic proclaimed 
was but skin-deep. The land policy proclaimed was a policy 
of landowners, and was unlikely to conciliate those who had 
formed the strength of that agrarian revolution which had well 
nigh swept the English out of Ulster. Owen O'Neill, the dar- 
ling of the Ulster population, came indeed to Kilkenny, and 
accepted an appointment as general of the Ulster forces from 
the Supreme Council ; but there was little real amity between 
him and the leaders of the Government of the Confederacy, 
especially as Phelini O'Neill, who was his rival in the North, 
and who claimed as well as himself the chieftainship 6f the sept, 
had lately married a daughter of Preston, with whom Owen 
O'Neill was by no means on good terms.^

m their hands, as a committee to examine into the 
state of affairs at Dublin. Not only had the Lords Justices 
permitted these rebels, as Charles styled them, to be present at 
the sittings of the Privy Council, but they had given their sup- 
port to a preacher who had declaimed against the King's 
marriage with an idolatress.^ It was only to be expected that 
Charles should do all that was in his power to secure his own 
authority in Dublin. 

As yet, however, Charles did not venture directly to attack 
Parsons. All that he could do was to prevent him from be- 
coming more powerful than he was. At the end of November 
Leicester was at Chester, hoping at last to cross the sea to take 
in hand the Lord Lieutenancy, to which he had been appointed 
so long before. It was absolutely certain that if he once reached 
Dublin he would take part with Parsons against Ormond, with 
whom he had a personal quarrel. On November 29, therefore, 
„ Charles, immediately after his arrival at Oxford, wrote 

Leicester to requcst his presence there, on the transparent 

forbidden '..,. , ,.'. .^ , 

to go to pretext of wishing to take his advice. Alter a long 
delay Leicester most unwillingly set out for Oxford; 
understanding clearly that it was not intended that he should 
ever hold authority in Ireland.*

of obtaining- payment for their services, drew up a remonstrance 
calling attention to their hard condition.' The news that the 
jj^^ ^ army which had been sent out under the authority 
Remon. ' of the English Parliament was dissatisfied with its 
the officers position appears to have roused Charles's interest in 
in re an . ^^ events which were passing beyond the sea. He 
had allowed the petition in which the Irish Catholics had asked 
that their grievances might be heard to remain unanswered for 
,643. many weeks. On January 1 1 he issued a commis- 
Charies"' ^'^"^ '•° Ormond, Clanricarde, and others to meet 
orders the (jjg CathoHc leaders, in order to report to him on 

opening of ^ 

negotiations, their complaints,^ 

If Charles had resolved to enter on this negotiation with an 
honest intention to face the enormous difiSculties of the Irish 
problem, he might well have been appalled by the hopelessness 
of the task which he had undertaken.. Until religious differ- 
ences ceased to exasperate nations to war, not only the preju- 
dices but the legitimate apprehensions of Englishmen of every 
party would stand up like a wall against a policy which would 
have established so near the shores of England a Church and a 
Government unavoidably hostile to her own religion and insti- 
tutions, and unavoidably allied with the Continental powers 
who were her bitterest rivals. Even those who may be inclined 
to wish that the experiment had been tried must be well aware 
that it could not have been tried with the good-will of any Pro- 
testant Englishman of the seventeenth century. 

Charles meddled with no such high matters. What he 

wanted was so to pacify the Irish Catholics as to be able to uti- 

Tan 12 ''^^ '•^^ English regiments in Ireland for service against 

Charles's the English Parliament. He informed Ormond that

that there would be no difificulty in executing them with laxity.

could not agree to restore the Plantation lands occupied before 
his own accession, but the whole subject might be referred to 
Commissioners after the conclusion of the main treaty. He 
would not promise that the Irish should be governed by their 
own countrymen, but he would consent that Irishmen should 
be qualified to hold office, 'because it will always be his 
Majesty's choice whom he will entrust with those charges, and 
if some of the more subordinate ministers be Irish, so long as 
they shall be controllable by the major part of the English, the 
danger will be less, and by degrees his Majesty may with more 
safety reduce the frame of government "to its former condi- 
tion.' ' 

It is unnecessary to say that the commission to treat was 

received with grave disapprobation by the Lords Justices and 

the English Committee. What was of more impor- 

Reception tancc, the officers of the army raised some objections,

""■ to' withdraw their opposition. Weary of expecting 
those supplies which the English Parliament was unable to give, 
the officers were easily induced by Ormond to turn to the King 
for the redress of their grievances.'' 

Charles's next step was likely to test the strength of his au- 
thority in Dublin. On February 3 he wrote to the Lords Jus- 
tices, rating them soundly for their presumption in

religion ; of wagers laid by persons in high position that within 
a year there should be no Catholic left in Ireland ; and of the 
intention of the English Parliament to introduce laws for the 
extirpation of the Catholic religion in the three kingdoms. 
Then came an attack upon the dependence of the Lords 
Justices upon the EngUsh House of Commons, and of their 
misconduct which had forced the lords of the Pale to take 
arms in self-defence. The remonstrance then proceeded to 
deal with the Confiscation Act of the English Parliament. 
The Irish Parliament, it declared, was entirely independent of 
the English, and the latter had no right to make laws for 
Ireland. As for the Irish Parliament as constituted under the 
Lords Justices, it was but a collection of their own partisans, 
in which the large majority of the members did not dare to 
appear. In conclusion, the Irish Commissioners asked for a 
free Parliament, in which all matters of interest might be dis- 
cussed, unhindered by Poynings' Act.' A Parliament mainly 
composed of Catholics, in short, was to draw up Bills for the 
settlement of Ireland, to be presented to the King for his 
acceptance. In recognition of the favours shown to them, the 
Irish Catholics were ready to send an army of 10,000 men in 
defence of the King's prerogatives. 

Whilst this remonstrance was speeding over the sea to 
Charles, a missive of a very different character was forwarded 
March 18. to him by the Lords Justices and that section of the 
Seiiorff I"sh Council which adhered to them. The picture 
Justices. jiere drawn of past history was very different from 
that which had been drawn by the Irish Commissioners. The 
Irish were the rebels, and they were the Royalists. The Irish, 
they declared, did not really care for their religion, but were 
ungrateful for the care which the English had taken of them, 
and had repaid it by the massacre of no less than 154,000 men, 
women, and children. Astounding as this statement was, 
there was one point in the argument of the Lords Justices 
which had been passed over entirely by the Irish Commis- 
sioners. If the Irish, after all that had passed, were suffered 

' A remonstrance of gdevances, March 17. Gilbert's Hist, of Iht 
Irish Confed. ii. 226. 



124 IRISH AND SCUTCH MOVEMENTS. CH. VI. 

to consolidate their power, would they allow the English to live 
on an equality with themselves? It was a mere question, 
therefore, which race was to reduce the other to slavery, and 
the Lords Justices were not alone in preferring to be masters 
rather than to be slaves. Cynicism, however, has seldom gone 
further than the cool anticipation of slaughter which followed. 
"They remember," say the writers, "that in the best of former 
times the Irish did so exceed in number, as that the governors 
never could or durst fully execute the laws for true reformation 
for fear of disturbance, having some hope always by civil 
and fair entreaty to win them into a civil and peaceable 
life ; so as if peace should now be granted them before 
the sword or famine have so abated them in number as that 
in reasonable time English colonies might overtop them, 
and so perhaps frame the residue into English manners and 
civil course of life, by trades and other good industry, to take 
comfort in a quiet life, the English do plainly foresee it can 
never be safe to cohabit with them, secure for England to enjoy 
them, or likely that themselves — separate from the English — 
can ever digest into a people good to themselves or profitable 
to their King and country." No peace, the Lords Justices 
repeated, could be safe or lasting ' till the sword have abated 
these rebels in number and power.' ' 

Whether Charles took either of the two policies thus offered 
to him into serious consideration it is impossible to say. The 
memorial which he had sent to Ormond in January ^ 
th/i\TO ^ shows that his wish was to come to terms with the 
policies. Catholics without offering to them any real power. 
Though it could not be doubted that this policy would in the 
long run fail signally, it might offer some immediate advantage. 
If it was dangerous for Charles to accept the 10,000 men 
named by the Irish Commissioners, it might not be dangerous 
to gain time by discussing the Irish grievances, in order to 
enable him to bring over from Ireland that English army on 
which he now knew that he could depend to fight his battles

in England. On March 31, therefore, he dismissed Parsons

April 23. formally authorising Ormond to treat for a cessation

cesation panying the commission he bade the Marquis to 
bring over ' bring over the Irish army to Chester,' as soon as 

e army, ^^j^^ cessation had been agreed upon.^ 
If Charles's Irish negotiation was unlikely to facilitate 
his objects in England, it was still less likely to facilitate 
Feb. his objects in Scotland. For some time Scottish 
Commis- Commissioncrs, among whom Loudoun and Hen- 
^"me'diate" derson wcrc conspicuous, had been urging him 
in England, (-q asscnt to their appearance as mediators in the 
English civil war, on the basis of an assimilation of the govern- 
ment and discipline of the Church of England with those of 

March 23 ^^ Church of Scotland. Charles had naturally re- 
rheirovtr- pelled these overtures,' and had rejected the request 
iected. of the Commissioners to be allowed to visit London 
April. on their return to their own country. Their language 
the Com-'^ had, howevcr, alarmed him as to the possibility of an

character given him by Hamilton through his brother Lanark. 
As usual, Hamilton had the fullest confidence in his own 
power of intrigue. There were noblemen enough in Scotland,

advice. Argyle and the clergy. Let Charles, above all things, 
avoid any attempt to coerce Scotland, and there would be no

Such advice was too consonant with Charles's nature to be 

lightly rejected by him. He gave directions to six Scott'sh 

noblemen, who happened to be at Oxford, to return 

''" ■ to their native country and to do everything in their 
power to stir up political opposition to Argyle.' 

Montrose, in the meanwhile, had come easily to the conclu- 
sion that Hamilton was no match for Argyle in the field of

anticipate the blow, a Scottish army would, before long, cross 
the border in support of the enemies of the King. Argyle being 
at present unprepared for war, a sudden attack made by him- 
self at the head of the forces which the Royalist nobility would 
be able to muster would change the state of affairs.^ Aboyne 
would be able to dispose of the whole strength of the Gordons, 
and, with the warm approval of Nithsdale, Antrim might be 
despatched to Ireland to bring over a force of Macdonells, the 
deadly enemies of the Campbells.' 

To counteract Montrose, Hamilton, taking with him 
Traquair, with whom he was now cordially acting, hastened 
May. to York to urge upon the Queen the superiority of 
pJan'finan'y ^'^ °^" plan. Henrietta Maria, it may be supposed, 
adopted. sympathised with the brilliant Montrose rather than 
with his saturnine rival, the more especially as Montrose pro- 
posed to act in combination with the Catholics and semi- 
Catholics of Scotland and Ireland ; but she was bound by her 
husband's orders, and the Scots who were present in her court 
were, for the most part, naturally averse to a scheme which

dismissed with fair words, but with the understanding that 
Hamilton's advice was to be followed.' 

It was part of the plan of Hamilton and Traquair that the 
Scots were to be assured that in no case would their Presby- 
Comparison '^^"^" Church bc endangered. Such a proposal was, 
between the as far as Scotland itself was concerned, wise and 

two policies, ... ,, , _^ 

conciliatory. \Vhere Charles was at fault was in 
failing to see that this policy would break down unless he acted 
in its spirit in England and in Ireland as well as in Scotland. 
To give it success in Edinburgh, it was necessary that he 
should be ready to make concessions to Puritanism in London. 
A policy which attempted to overbear the religion of half Eng- 
land by means of armies reinforced by troops set free in con- 
sequence of an understanding with Irish Catholics, would be 
fatal to a policy of conciliation in Scotland. Montrose's advice 
was, as matters stood, the best, not because it was in itself 
admirable, but because it was in accordance with the system 
created by the Irish cessation and the breach of the negotia- 
tions at Oxford. Charles would almost certainly have prospered 
if he had set himself earnestly to conciliate those of his enemies 
whom it was possible to conciliate ; and he might possibly 
have prospered if he had carried on war unsparingly with all the 
forces at his command. The mixture of weak military opera- 
tions with weak diplomacy was fatal to his hopes.

CHAPTER VII. 

READING AND STRATTON. 

It would be some time before regiments from Ireland 
could be made available by Charles. In the meanwhile he 
had to bear the brunt of an assault upon his central position at 
1643. Oxford. On April 13, the day after that on which the 
EsteTieaves -^'"S issucd the message which had brought the ne- 
windsor. gotlations to a close, Essex advanced from Windsor 
to lay siege to Reading, a siege which, in the common belier 
of his army, was but the preliminary to that of Oxford itself. 

On the 15 th the Parliamentary army swept round the 
southern outskirts of Reading, and seized on Caversham 

April 15. Bridge, in order to bar the way against a relieving 
ri"ge'tr force from Oxford. A Royalist post on Caversham 
Re ding. jjin ^^g easily stormed, and the preparations for an 
attack on the town itself were carried briskly on. Sir Arthui 
Aston, tlie governor of Reading, was a Catholic, and as such 
failed to command the entire confidence of his soldiers, of 
whose want of all military qualities he bitterly complained. 
The place was, however, strongly fortified, and Essex proceeded 
with his usual deliberation, risking the lives of his men as little 
as possible. The arrival of Lord Grey of Wark from Hertford- 
shire, with a reinforcement 5,000 strong, enabled him to complete 
the investment. London kept him well supplied with provisions, 
and the country around was favourable to his cause, 
summons Eagerly did Charles call on Rupert, who was still 

"''"'■ engaged at Lichfield,' to hasten back to the succour 
of the beleaguered garrison. Powder was running short within

from a falling tile. 

Lichfield surrendered on the 21st, and Rupert at once 
turned his horses' heads southwards. On the 24th he over-

the escape of the garrison. When he approached Caversham 
he learned that Colonel Feilding, on whom, when Aston was 
laid aside, the command of the garrison had devolved, had 
already hung out a flag of truce, and had offered to surrender

toVeiiive Caversham bridge was defeated by a Parliamentary 
Reading. force SO inferior in numbers to his own, that the 
Puritan soldiers were able to boast, with even more than their 
usual assurance, that this success was a clear evidence of 
Divine intervention in their favour. It is possible, however, 
that the attack, made after negotiations had been opened, was 
not pushed home. 

As soon as the musquetry fire was heard in Reading some 
of the ofificers of the garrison urged Feilding to sally out to 
Charles's assistance. Feilding replied that his honour was 
engaged to keep the truce, and that if the King himself were 
to knock at the gate and command him to break his word he 
would disobey him.' 

On the 26th, by the permission of Essex, the request of the 
garrison for leave to capitulate was laid before the King. As 
the defenders of Reading were to be allowed to 
Camtuiati'on march out with the honours of war, Charles, who had 
of Reading, jj^pg^j f^^ nothing better even in the event of a 
successful attack, willingly gave his approbation, and on the 
27th the Royalist troops left the town. On the pretext that 
some of the soldiers carried out arms contrary to the capitu- 
lation, some of them were attacked and robbed as they passed

the gates, though the Parliamentary officers did their best to 
stop these outrages.' 

Feilding met with a bad reception at Oxford. His kins- 
man, Basil Feilding, who had recently succeeded to the 
earldom of Denbigh, was fighting on the side of the Houses, 
. . and a suspicion easily grew up that the governor of 

condemned Reading had been bribed or influenced by family 

ties to surrender the place. He was brought before 
a court-martial and sentenced to death. The King, who is 
said to have been irritated by one of the articles of the 
capitulation, according to which deserters from the Parlia- 
mentary ranks found in Reading were to_ be handed over to 
Essex, wished to carry out the sentence. At once there arose 
a violent contest amongst his followers. On one side it was 
maintained that Feilding was a low-minded traitor, whilst the 
other side was equally confident that he was innocent of the 
crime laid to his charge. Between the two parties Charles 

vacillated. Twice Feilding mounted the scaflbld,

of his life.'

The King's panied by some letters written by the King which had

urged that commander to hasten to his succour with 
all possible speed. The King's failure to relieve Reading, the 
intercepted letters, and every indication which spies could 
bring, led to the conclusion that Charles could not hold out at 
Oxford before a resolute attack. Yet on the very day that the 
Essex can- capturcd letters reached Westminster a jarring note 
wUhoSr i" ths song of triumph was struck. Stapleton and 
money. Goodwin had come up from Reading to warn the 
Houses that without pay for his army Essex could not 
move. 

Honest and devoted as he was, Essex was not the man to 
conduct to a successful end the enterprise which he had under- 
taken. Methodical by nature and by his training in the Dutch 
service, he had none of the inspiration of genius or of the 
daring energy which goes far to supply its place. He could 
lead his troops to victory if the conditions were favourable ; if 
they were unfavourable he could not grapple with the obstacles 
in his path, and snatch the prize from the grasp of obdurate 
nature. 

As yet there was no disposition in the Houses to throw 
blame on their commander. The great majority of the 
members only thought of providing for him the money which 
he needed. Yet the spirit which eventually brought about the 
discharge of Essex from his functions was already making 
itself felt, the spirit which regarded hesitancy as treason and 
Henry lukcwarmness as a crime. The Lord General's 

an?North- bitterest critic was Henry Marten. Hating all 
umberiand. ghams and unrealities, and ever ready to speak out 
the thought which lay unformed in the minds of others, he 
had nothing but scorn for those who thought it possible to 
proceed in the ways of peace. A letter which N orthumberland 
had written to his wife whilst he was still negotiating at Oxford

had fallen into the hands of Marten, who tore it open to see 
whether it contained indications of treachery. On April i8 

the wrathful Earl, meeting Marten at a conference, 
Northum- taxed him with his ungentlemanly conduct, and on t 
cudleis receiving the reply that he was 'no whit sorry,' 
**^"™' struck him on the head with a cane. Each House 
took up the cause of its own member, but it was impossible 
either for the Lords to defend the blow given by Northumber- 
land or for the Commons to defend Marten's conduct ; and, 
after some altercation, the subject was allowed to drop.' 

Marten and those who agreed with him soon found a safer 
mode of displaying their zeal. The irritation caused by the 
King's defiant attitude first expended itself on inanimate 

objects. On April 24 the Commons appointed a

in their own country.' Marten cried out that Parliament 
should assume sovereign authority before sending ambassadors 
to contract an alliance.'' Pym had too much worldly wisdom 
to allow so unnecessary and so dividing a question to be 
raised. He and his followers protested loudly against a course 
which would lead ' to the utter subversion of this monarchy 
and the dethroning of the King.' The proposal to open com- 
munications with Scotland was adopted, though, apparently in 
consequence of the lukewarmness of the Peers, nothing was 
done for some time to carry out the resolution of the Com- 
mons. It may be that Pym was the more earnest in rejecting

or to delude her into the belief that Essex could march against

undertook to deal. She replied in a way which was calculated 
to keep her correspondents in hope, while she strained every 
nerve to forward to her husband the supplies of which he was 
sorely in need.' 

It was high time for help to come if Oxford was to be

members of Parliament, "are honest, disjointed fellows." 
In the campaign of 1643 the Parliamentary troops might well 
have been described as honest, disjointed armies. 

The Parliamentary military organisation was still to be created. 
The traditions of organisation served the Royalists well. What- 
Royaiist ^^^' might be wanting amongst them, there was at 
organisa. least the Combination of distant forces on a precon- 
certed plan. Therefore the balance of the war, which 
in the last week in April appeared to be inclining in favour of 
Parliament, began in the third week in May to incline in favour 
of the King. Preparations were vigorously made for taking up 
Charles's original scheme of moving forward his two wings from 
Yorkshire and Cornwall. The arrival of the Queen's convoy at 
Oxford was but the fruit-fruits of the offering which she had 
brought to her husband. On May 18 she wrote that she would

relieve the Earl of Derby, who was hard pressed in Lancashire. 
When that had been successfully effected, and she was herself 
enabled to move, she would clear Lincolnshire, and that task 
once accomplished would appear at Oxford at the head of 1,000 
foot and 1,500 horse.' 

After Lancashire had been succoured the southward march 
of Newcastle might be expected to begin. Tidings were already 
on their way from the West which showed that Hopton had 
already overcome the initial difficulties of an eastward march 
from Cornwall. Encouraged by Chudleigh's success on Sour- 
Stamford ton Down,^ Stamford placed himself at the head of 
cOTMiand !n '^^ army under his command, and resolved on carry-

6,800 men, whilst Hopton and the Cornish leaders at Launces- 
ton had with them less than half the number, he determined to 
despatch the greater part of his horse to Bodmin in order to 
suppress any attempt to muster the trained bands there. With

The ground occupied by Stamford was well chosen. A 
ridge of high ground running from north to south parallel with 
the coast dips sharply down, and rises as sharply again to a 
grassy hill, from the southern end of which there is a still deeper 
cleft through which the road descends steeply to the left into 
the valley in which lies the little town of Stratton. On the top 
of this hill, the sides of which slope in all directions from the 
highest point to the edge of the plateau, the Parliamentary army 
lay. Beyond this plateau the ground falls away in all directions, 
more especially on the eastern side, where the position was 
almost impregnable if seriously defended. The ascent from the 
west was decidedly the easiest, but an earthwork had been 
thrown up on this side, the guns from which commanded the 
whole of the approach from this quarter. ' 

Undismayed by the odds against them, Hopton and his 

comrades resolved to break up from Launceston in order to

the afternoon word was brought to the commanders that their 
scanty stock of powder was almost exhausted. A retreat under 
such circumstances would have been fatal, and the word was 
given that a supreme effort must be made. Trusting to pike 
and sword alone, the lithe Cornishmen pressed onwards and 
upwards. Their silent march seems to have struck their oppo- 
nents with a sense of power. The defence grew feeble, and on 
the easier western slope, where Grenvile fought, and on the; 
northern, on which Sir John Berkeley led the attack, the outer 
edge of the plateau was first gained. Immediately the handful 
of horse which had remained with Stamford turned and fled, 
the commander-in-chief, it is said, setting the example. In 
vain Chudleigh, now second in command, rallied the foot for 
a desperate charge. For a moment he seemed to make an 
impression on che approaching foe, but he incautiously pressed 
too far in advance, and was surrounded and captured. His 
men, left without a commander, at once gave way and re- 
treated to the farther part of the plateau. By this time the other 
two Royalist detachments, finding resistance slackening, had 
made their way up, and the victorious commanders embraced 
one another on the hard-won hill-top, thanking God for a suc- 
cess for which at one time they had hardly ventured to hope. 
It was no time to prolong their rejoicings, as the enemy, de- 
moralised as he was, still clung to the heights. Seizing the 
cannon which had been abandoned in the earthwork, the 
Royalist commanders turned them upon Stamford's cowed fol- 
lowers. The frightened men had no one to encourage them to 
deeds of hardihood, and, following the example of the cavalry, 
they too dashed down the slope in headlong flight. Of the 
Parliamentary soldiers, 300 had been killed, and 1,700 were 
taken prisoners, besides Chudleigh and thirty of his officers. 
All the cannon with a large store of ammunition and pro- 
visions fell into the hands of the victors. From that day the 
spot on which the wealthy Earl demonstrated his signal incom- 
petence as a leader of men has been known as Stamford Hill.*

01 his antagonists. His own proclivities were Royalist. 
At the beginning of the war he had made his way to Oxford to 
offer his services to the King, but it was not forgotten there 
that, at the time of Strafford's trial, he had been the bearer of 
messages between the army and the Court, and that his evi- 
dence on the army plot given before a Parliamentary committee 
had told heavily against the King.' Taking umbrage at the 
cold looks and bitter words with which he was received, he 
had transferred his services to the Parliament, and returning now 
to his natural allegiance, he deserted a cause which he had 
only adopted through pique. He attempted to persuade his 
father, Sir George Chudleigh, who was in command of the 
cavalry which had been despatched to Bodmin, to follow his 
example ; but the old man contented himself with resigning 
his commission, lest even a suspicion of his son's treachery 
should attach itself to his person.^ 

It was easy, at Westminster, to lay the whole blame of the 
disaster upon Chudleigh's treason. It was none the less neces-

Together with the tale of disaster from the West more 
cheerful tidings reached Westminster from the North. By a 
dashing night attack the younger Fairfax had sur- 
Wakefieid prised Wakefield, though it was held by a force far 
surprise . gupcrior in numbers to his own. The blow was well 
aimed, but it could not affect Newcastle's preponderance in 
Yorkshire. Fairfax had 1,400 prisoners to exchange — among 
them the double-traitor Goring — and that was all. He was 
compelled to abandon Wakefield almost as soon as it was 
taken, whilst Newcastle firmly established himself at Pontefract, 
and occupied Rotherham and Sheffield.' 

If Charles was superior to Essex in strategy, he was far 
inferior to Pym in diplomacy. Whilst Pym sought as ever to 
combine homogeneous elements of resistance, Charles pursued 
his usual course of attempting to combine in his favour ele- 
ments of attack which were mutually repugnant. Just as he 
had failed to see that an understanding with the Irish Catholics 
would make it difficult for him to secure the neutrality of the 
Scottish Presbyterians, he now failed to perceive that the 
negotiation which he was still carrying on with the King of Den- 
The ro- mark for aid, on the basis of the cession of Orkney 
posed ces- and Shetland to that King whose ancestor had once 

sion of 

Orkney and pledged the islaods to the Scottish Crown, would 
rouse the national feeling of the Scots against himself. 
Henrietta Maria, however, through whose hands the negotia- 
tion passed, was shrewd enough to doubt whether the abandon- 
ment of Shetland and the Orkneys was likely to be helpful to 
Hamilton in his attempt to form a Royalist party in Edinburgh.^

with the King of Denmark to deliver them to him when your

it at this instant, and that if the King of Denmark agrees to 
that, he that shall go shall treat with him about the place where 
he shall land his forces and where his ships shall come, and 
do this quickly and without delay." ' Charles followed his 
wife's counsel, and worded his promise to cede the islands in 
terms so cautious that Christian shrank from risking a fleet 
and army on so uncertain a security.^ 

In the field of domestic intrigue the Queen seemed likely 
to be more successful. Amongst those who were now attracted 
to Royalism by their natural affinities were the two Hothams, 
both of whom were also influenced by jealousy of the Fairfaxes.

duke Langdale might be sent to confer with him. " I have no 
doubt," he added, " he is instructed to treat as with gentlemen 
who value their honour above anything." In the end Hotham 
gave Newcastle to understand that he and his father were ready 
to carry out the design agreed on — a design which appears to 
have embraced the betrayal of Hull and Lincoln — though it

\\ ould take some time to carry it into practice. Above all, it would 
be necessary 'to hinder Colonel Cromwell's marching hither.' ' 
Colonel Cromwell's name was already a terror to those who 
were inclined to play fast and loose with the Parliamentary cause. 
Cromwell Whilst Essex contented himself with indicating the 
extern causes of his own failure, Cromwell, in his lower 
counties. sphere, set himself to make failure impossible. He 
had early recognised that the weakness of the Parliamentary 
army was above all a weakness in cavalry, and he determined 
that the troop which he commanded as a captain, and the 
regiment which he subsequently commanded as a colonel, 
should fear no comparison with Rupert's high-ispirited cavaliers. 
The men whom he selected from the Puritan freeholders and 
farmers of the eastern counties were such as had thrown their 
whole hearts into the religious strife, and were also ready, for 
the sake of victory, to submit to the iron discipline which he 
imposed on them. To trust in God and to keep their powder 
dry — the popular summary of his requirements — in other 
words, to combine practical efficiency with enthusiasm, was 
the secret of the marvellous success of Cromwell's soldiers. 
As for himself, he was an ideal cavalry officer on the field of 
battle, as fiery as Rupert in the charge, as cautious as Essex 
in preparation, with a never-failing presence of mind, which 
was all his own, and which never allowed him to be carried 
away by the excitement of victory or to be depressed by the 
weight of adversity. 

By the end of April, Cromwell had stamped out whatever 
sparks of Royalism were to be found within the bounds of the 
Eastern Association, and, as Hotham feared, was soon fighting 
his way through Lincolnshire, where the Royalists from Newark 
dominated the county. Delivering Crowland from attack, he

that time posted at Nottingham. ^ The plan came to nothing. 
Local jealousies were too strong to admit of common action. 
It needs no explanation to account for the reluctance of the 
force at Lincoln to move as long as the younger Hotham was 
in the place, and Grey, whose father's house was not far from 
Leicester, refused to stir for fear of exposing that town to 
danger. " Believe me," wrote Cromwell to the Committee of 
Lincoln, " it were better, in my poor opinion, Leicester were 
not, than that there should not be found an immediate taking 
of the field by our forces to accomplish the common ends.'' 

The entire subordination of private and local aims to the 
common ends was one of the secrets of Cromwell's success. If 
others failed him, he would not make that an excuse for remiss- 
ness. On the evening of May 13 he found himself with twelve 
troops of horse, ' whereof some so poor and broken that you 
May 13. shall seldom see worse,' opposed to double their 
s^nnish number, two miles from Grantham on the Newark 
Grantham, joad. Without counting heads, he gave the word to 
charge. The spirit of their commander gave force to the fol- 
lowers, and the larger host broke and fled before the smaller. 
" With this handful," wrote Cromwell, in recounting the event, 
''it pleased God to cast the scale." ' The whole fortune of the 
Civil War was in that nameless skirmish. A body of Puritan 
horsemen had driven twice their number before them as chaff 
before the wind, and as armies were then constituted superiority 
in cavalry was superiority in war. 

Whatever the future might have in store, Cromwell knew 
well that the Eastern Association could not be saved by twelve 
troops of horse. Not without reason had he striven to rouse the 
neighbouring commanders to combine for an attack upon Newark, 
the connecting link between the Royalism of Yorkshire and the 
Royalism of Oxford. The brilliant surprise of Wakefield by the 
younger Fairfax did not blind Cromwell to the inherent weak- 
ness of the Parliamentary cause in Yorkshire, and he knew that, 
if once the defenders of the West Riding were overpowered, 
Newcastle would soon be at Newark, and that it would need all 
the resolution of the inhabitants of the Association, and far

more harmony between its commanders than had been hitherto 
displayed, to bar his road to London. Like Essex, Cromwell 
May 28. was in desperate straits for money. It profited him 
b'^sSs" lit'l^ that on May 26 his native county of Hunting- 
for money, don was added to the Eastem Association.' "Lay 
not," he wrote to the men of Colchester, " too much on the 
back of a poor gentleman who desires, without much noise, to 
lay down his life and bleed the last drop to serve the cause and 
you. I ask not your money for myself. I desire to deny my- 
self, but others will not be satisfied." ^ Voluntary contributions 
are but a slender staff on which to lean. In two months the 
whole of the payments from the five counties which composed 
the Association reached no more than 3,372/., of which the 
share borne by the single county of Cambridgeshire, in which 
Cromwell's influence was the highest, was little less than 2,000/.-'

was depressing. Devonshire had been overrun in the West, and

On IVIay 19 Alexander Hampden, a cousin of the member 
for Buckinghamshire, was despatched from Oxford, ostensibly 
May 19. to call upon the Houses to return an answer to the 
AVcxL°n"der Hiessage of April 12,' in which Charles had de-

forts. In the communication brought by Hampden, the King 
threw the blame for all misfortunes which might befall the 
country upon those by whom his reasonable offers were refused.

his plenty of ammunition, which some men lately might con- 
ceive he wanted, that it must be confessed that nothing but 
the tenderness and love to his people, and those Christian im- 
pressions ' with which his heart was touched, ' could move him 
once more to hazard a refusal.' ^ 

In the Upper House there was a majority in favour of the 
acceptance of any possible compromise. Conway and Port-

Queen." He then moved that she should be impeached, and, 
after a feeble opposition, his motion was carried without a 
division. Pym was sent to lay the impeachment before the 
peers. ' 

Evidently the House was influenced by the King's boast- 
ful reference to the store of ammunition with which the 
Queen's energy had provided him. Its leaders acted under a 
sense of impending danger, the depth of which they were as 
yet unable to fathom. Either Alexander Hampden or some

the Commons ordered that Hampden should be detained in 
custody.^

suspicions of the Committee of Safety. Shortly after Hamp-

A sermon to attend him immediately in the House. D'Ewes, 
interrupted, ^j^^ refuscd to obey the summons till the sermon was 
atanend, found, when he left the church, that the streets were 
guarded by soldiers. The Westminster trained bands were not 
all devoted to the Parliamentary cause, and he overheard some 
of them muttering that the plot had been invented in order to 
give an excuse for fresh taxation. D'Ewes himself was at 
first inclined to share this opinion, but, welcome as a belief in 
Pym's trickery would iiave been to his mind, he soon came 
round to the opinion that Parliament and the City had escaped 
a great danger. 

Conway, in fact, with his military instincts, had put the 
vague design originally entertained into a practical shape. A 
secret association was formed in the City, no member 
organises of which was to be acquainted with the names of 
t e p ot. more than three others amongst the associates. It 
was calculated that in London itself about one-third of the 
population was Royalist, whilst in the suburbs the proportion 
rose to four-fifths. Royalists as well as Parliamentarians were 
to be found in the trained bands, detachments of which 
guarded in turn the new fortifications. A night was to be 
selected on which the Royalists on guard were in a ma- 
jority. They would then seize upon the magazines of arms 
and powder, and upon the principal military positions. Lord 
Mayor Pennington and his chief supporters in the City would 
be seized in their beds, and at Westminster Say and Wharton, 
Pym, Hampden, Stapleton, and Strode were to share their fate. 
The King was to send a force of 3,000 men to the neighbour- 
hood of London. To this force the gates were to be thrown 
open, and with its help rebellion would be crushed and the 
civil war at an end. 

To giye an aspect of legality to the design Charles had for- 
warded to London the Commission of Array which had been 
issued in March.* It had been entrusted to the beautiful and

"You must show," Roe had written a few weeks before, "that 
peace is ravished from you, and your arras are only employed

at a time when he was offering to negotiate, Charles 
'^^ ^'' showed that he considered his opponents as rebels 
to be crushed, not as adversaries to be conciliated. The result 
was a deepening of the gulf, already far too deep, by which the 
parties were divided. Charles was coming to be regarded at 
Westminster, no longer as a sovereign led astray by evil coun- 
sellors, but as a conspirator against the peace and safety of the 
nation. This feeling was a few days later rendered even more

that so cautious a strategist as Essex contemplated 
an attack on Oxford as long as it was held by forces not inferior 
to his own, and he probably intended no more than to protect 
Buckinghamshire from plunder, and to interpose an obstacle 
in the way of the Queen's march from Yorkshire. In the mean- 
while he allowed his own troops to scatter themselves over a 
wide extent of country, so as to invite attack by an enemy 
whose cavalry was far superior to his own. 

Hampden, it is said, warned Essex of the risk to which he 
was exposed. For purposes of attack the Parliamentary army

Thame from London, and he resolved to strike for the prize. 
An hour after midnight the tramp of his band was heard by 
the sentinels at Tetsworth ; shots were fired and an 
alarm given. Two hours later, as the sky was whiten- 
ing before the dawn, he surprised a few of Essex's soldiers at 
Postcombe. In the early morning light he surrounded 
Chinnor, and fell suddenly upon a party of new-levied men 
who were soundly sleeping in the hamlet. Some fifty poor 
wretches were shot down or knocked on the head as they at- 
tempted to escape, and 120 surrendered themselves as prisoners.

It was now time to look out for the expected convoy. Rupert's 
proceedings, however, had been too noisy for secrecy. The 
drivers were warned by a countryman, and they turned the 
heads of their team into the woods which clothed the sides of 
the Chiltern Hills, where, now that the enemy had been fully 
roused, Rupert could not venture to follow. 

Through his own want of judgment Rupert had missed his 
prey. Sweeping round as he returned under the hills to the 
left, as if loth to hurry back, he at last, skirmishing 
as he went with the gathering foe, directed his march 
upon Oxford. Sending forward his foot to Chiselhampton

Bridge to guard the line of retreat, he faced with his horse on 
Chalgrove Field the now increasing numbers of the enemy, 
roused by the tidings of his presence from the villages round. 
Amongst them, though as yet he knew it not, was Hampden, who 
slept that night at Watlington, and who, roused from his sleep 
by the cry of alarm, had thrown himself as a volunteer amongst 
the ranks of the first comrades with whom he met. The Par- 
liamentary troops were indeed insufficient to combat Rupert 
with any prospect of success, but they hoped that by threaten- 
ing him they might hold him back till succours could arrive 
from headquarters. It was dangerous to play such a game with 
Rupert. "This insolency," he said to his comrades, "is not 
to be borne." He was the first to leap the hedge behind which 
the enemy was drawn up. By the confession of the gallant 
troopers who followed him, the Roundheads fought that day 
as they had never fought before. The odds of numbers were, 
however, against them, and after a while they broke and fled. 
This time Rupert did not gallop off in wild pursuit. Knowing 
that a large force sent by Essex would soon be on the place of 
combat, he drew rein and made his way safely to Oxford with 
his prisoners.' 

It is not with Rupert that the thoughts of the visitor to Chal- 
grove Field are mainly concerned. Hampden's is the abiding

1643 HAMPDEN'S CHARACTER. 153 

So little was it Hampden's habit to put himself forward in 
political life, that the historian is apt to ask himself whether^ 
after all, he deserved the fame whicji has crowned him. Other 
men outstripped him in the senate and in the field. He seldom 
spoke in the House of Commons, and never at any length. As 
a soldier he won no battles and reduced no fortresses. ' Yet 
the impression which he made upon his contemporaries cannot 
be lightly set aside. Friend and foe are of one mind in recog- 
nising his power. A thoroughly loyal man, without even the 
infirmity of ambition, his first and last thought was his duty to 
his country. Inspired with the loftiest and most enduring cou- 
rage, ready to throw himself into the breach in peace or war 
whenever occasion demanded the sacrifice, he had too high a 
reverence for the virtue of subordination to resist the authority 
which he regarded as lawful. He was never heard to murmur. 
The belief that he regarded the generalship of Essex as too cau- 
tious and hesitating was so widely spread that it cannot be al- 
together false, but he never attempted, even indirectly, to weaken 
his authority. He doubtless felt — for such men feel rather 
than reason — that insubordination was worse than bad gene- 
ralship, and he made no exception when his own person was 
concerned.^ 

that dough's narrative of Hampden's last days found in the Gentleman's 
Magazine for May 181 5, is a nineteenth-century forgery. The belief that 
we possess the words of Hampden's last prayer must therefore be aban- 
doned. 

' Lord Nugent indeed has a long account of an early siege of Reading, 
in which Hampden plays a conspicuous part, but that siege has no founda- 
tion in fact, the authority for it being one of the many lying pamphlets of 
the time. 

'' The following letter, the last written by Hampden, as far as we 
know, before he died, is very characteristic of the qaiet self-possession of 
one who, placing duty above everything else, expected others to do the 
same. His cousin Cromwell would have penned a far more fieiy appeal, 
but hardly one more effectual: "Sir, my Lord General hath written to 
the county of Essex to call in the well-affected people to his assistance, 
and hath entreated the help of the Deputy Lieutenants in it. The work 
is so necessary and so hopeful that I cannot but improve the interest I 
have in yourself for the promoting of it. The power of Essex is great, a 
place of most life of religion in the land, and your power in the county is

That Hampden, if he had lived, would have brought about 
a peace on terms satisfactory to both parties is an idea which 
could only arise amongst those who misunderstand alike his 
character and the political situation. His ideas on Church and 
State were such as ought to have made it easy for him to come 
to an understanding with Falkland, but he never could have 
come to an understanding with Charles. The constant in- 
trigues, the reliance on foreign aid, the plots and conspiracies 
which occupied so large a space in Charles's statesmanship, 
built up a wall of separation between him and Hampden which 
could never be passed over. If there was still a lurking hope 
in Hampden's mind that Charles might be won over from his 
evil counsellors, it was never likely to be more. For the pre- 
sent open war was the path of duty. To tear asunder the web 
of mingled violence and deceit which was ennobled by the name 
of constitutional right was the work to which Hampden had 
devoted himself, in all modesty, but with all the vigour of a 
well-balanced nature, and there is no reason to suppose that if 

great too. The difficulties of this war needs the utmost of both. Our 
army wants both men and money, and therefore their help in this way 
proposed would be very seasonable. I know you need not be moved to a 
thing that you apprehend for the good of the cause. Such I conceive this 
business for the good of the kingdom in general, and so of Essex in par- 
ticular. Consider of it, and you will find it deserves your serious and 
hearty endeavours. It will be a service acceptable to my Lord General, 
and you shall further engage your affectionate cousin and servant, J"" 
Hampden." Hampden to Sir T. Barrington, June 9. Barrington MSS. 
The letter from Essex himself in the same collection is also noteworthy. 
"I desire," he writes, "such may appear in this cause as have most 
interest in it, such of whose constancy and courage we may be assured, 
men of religious lives and affections, fittest to bear arms for truth of 
religion, men of estates to defend those estates that the enemy seeks to 
devour. The employment is not too mean for the best men ; and then we 
shall hope for success when such put their hands to the work ; for assure 
yourselves the looseness and inconstancy of the soldiers amongst others is 
one cause of the continuance of the war." It is evidently wrong to attri- 
bute to Cromwell the sole credit of an attempt to fill the regiments with 
pious men. What .'istinguished him was that he succeeded in doing what 
others only attem^ed. I have, however, seen a statement in a contem- 
-potary-parnphlet to the effect that none of Hampden's officers had ever 
sworn excepting in a court of justice. 



1643 CHARLES DEFIES THE PARLTAMENT. 155 

he had hved longer he would ever have learned to place confi- 
dence in Charles. 

Two days after the skirmish at Chalgrove Field Charles re- 
plied to the Parliamentary covenant in a strain of fierce defiance. 
June 2o. In a proclamation issued on June 20, in order to lead 
dedarai the '^P '^ '^^ conclusion that the Houses were in durance 
Parliament (-q arbitrary power, he recited a whole catalogue of 
free. the illegalities of which Parliament had been guilty, 

though they were in truth no more than the necessary conse- 
quences of its virtual assumption of sovereign authority. Par- 
liament being no longer free, all who abetted it in its usurpa- 
tion were liable to the penalties of high treason, though with the 
exception of five lords and thirteen commoners any one of these 
persons presenting themselves at Oxford would be welcome, 
' until by the adjournment of the Houses to some fit and free 
place, or otherwise, due course be taken for the full and free 
convention in Parliament of us and all the members of both 
Houses.' ' 

Such a proclamation was one of those half-measures which 
combine the maximum of irritation with the minimum of advan- 
tage. From this day the Houses at Westminster were regarded 
at Oxford merely as a pretended Parliament, consisting, as the 
wits never ceased to assert with wearisome iteration, of three 
Houses — the Common Council, the House of Commons, and 
the House of three Lords. Officially they were treated by the 
King as non-existent, and as being therefore incapable of ad- 
dressing to him a petition or of sending to him a Bill. At the 
same time Charles did not as yet propose, as with a slight stretch 
of authority he might well have done, to gather round him at 
Oxford a Parliament of his own, from which he might have 
derived constitutional support. 

For the moment Charles was content to rely on his military 
preponderance. It seemed as if the unwieldy host of Essex 
might be subjected to any indignities. On the zsth

During the weeks which witnessed for a second time the

directed to a prolonged inquiry into the ramifica-

that lord whispered to me apart, which for the most part he did when he 
mentioned the Earl of Northumberland, so that but for me, I think — nay, 
I am confident — you had never known anything of this business, which 
was by them prepared for another ; and therefore I cannot imagine why 
you should wed it so fast as to co.itract your own ruin by concealing it, 
and persisting unreasonably to hide that truth which without you already 
is and will every day be made more manifest. Can you imagine yourself 
obliged in honour to keep that secret which is already revealed by another, 
or possible it should still be a secret which is known to one of the other

to Portland. June ? Sanford's Studies of the Relellion, 563. This letter 
appears to me to be inconsistent with Portland's statement that Waller 
wanted him to join in making a false accusation. In that case Waller 
might have painted in high colours the advantages of the immunity which 
he would gain by so doing, but he would not have entered into details 
which the recipient of his letter must have known to be entirely false.

spared. 

As a member of the House of Commons, Waller could 
not appear before a court-martial without leave given by 
July 4. the House. On July 4 he was brought to the bar 
thebarof 'o show causc why that leave should be refused,

prisoner. Dressed in deep mourning, ' as if he had been going 
to execution itself,' he made no attempt to excuse his fault, 
disclaiming, probably with entire disregard of truth, all know- 
ledge of the military arrangements made by the other con- 
spirators, and dwelling solely on two points on which he knew 
his fellow-members to be most sensitive, their dislike of creating 
a precedent for handing themselves over to the judgment of 
soldiers. This pleading was not entirely in vain. Waller was 
expelled the House, but he remained in prison for many months, 
untried and unsentenced, till the throng of events had almost 
blotted out the memory of his crime.' 

Like Conway and Portland, Lady Daubigny persisted in 
denying all knowledge of the plot. Lady Sophia Murray, 

charged with carrying on a correspondence with 
bigny and Falkland, refused to be examined at all. " I do not 
Sophia mean,'' she said boldly to the Committee of Safety, 
Murray. „ ^.^ ^j^^ ^^ account to such fellows as you are." A 

few voices were raised in the House for sending the 

two ladies before a court-martial, but in the end 
respect for their sex prevailed, and no further attempt was made 
to inflict any penalty upon them.^ 

Conway and Portland were equally fortunate. The feeling 

of the Lords was strongly against allowing members of their 

^ House to be convicted on the testimony of a single 

Liberation witness, and on July 31, after a detention of seven 

and Port- weeks, they were liberated on bail.* Their enforced 

absence from their places had weakened the Peace- 
party amongst the peers at a critical moment.

«64:i HOTHAM'S PLOT. 159 

During those weeks the wave of calamity which had been 
gradually rising burst upon the Houses like a flood. Early in 
June 2. June, indeed, it seemed for a time as if Cromwell's 
ftNottTng? hope of gathering the forces of the Northern Midlands 
ham. fQj fjjg rescue of the Fairfaxes from Newcastle's 

overwhelming power was at last to be realised. Some 6,000 
men under Lords Grey of Groby and Willoughby of Parham, 
Cromwell, Gell, the younger Hotham, and others were gathered 
at Nottingham,' with the view of a march into Yorkshire. 
Local feeling was once more too strong for Cromwell's ardour 
on behalf of the common cause. The appearance of a strong 
body of Royalists in the neighbourhood served as an excuse 
for remaining at home, and a letter bearing the signatures of 
five commanders, amongst which that of Cromwell, though 
doubtless not with his own goodwill, is to be found, announced 
to Fairfax that Newcastle's army in Yorkshire had 

June 2. 

been so weakened that their own presence in York- 
shire was quite unnecessary. Fairfax in reply told them that 
they were entirely misinformed, and that the ' Popish army ' 
was strong enough to ruin him, whatever report might say.^ 

The letter of the commanders was in the handwriting of 
Captain Hotham, and doubtless it conveyed his sentiments. 
Hotham's He was longing to carry out the treacherous compact 
Nottbg-*' which he had made with Newcastle.' He was, how- 
ham ever, anything but a good conspirator. His soldiers 
were as turbulent and unprincipled as himself. The warmest 
supporters of the Parliamentary cause complained bitterly that 
their homes were marked out for plunder by these marauders. 
To the remonstrances of Hutchinson, the leader of the Puritans 
of Nottingham, Hotham replied with scorn. " I fight for 
liberty," he said, " and I expect it in all things.'' Cell's men 
were scarcely better disciplined, and Lord Grey was weakly 
compliant. Hutchinson found in Cromwell a man to whom 
disorder was as detestable as to himself. The two watched

Hotham's proceedings closely, and soon discovered that he 
was in constant communication with the garrison at Newark. 
His conduct grew more insufferable than ever. Quarrelling 
with Lord Grey's men about the possession of some oats, he 
offered to fight them to settle the dispute, and he turned his 
cannon upon Cromwell himself. Cromwell and Hutchinson 
laid their narrative of his proceedings before the Committee of 
Safety, and the Committee passed the intelligence on to Essex. 
Essex ordered the arrest of Hotham, and sent Sir John 
Meldrum, a Scottish officer of tried ability and character, to 
June i8. take the command of all the forces then at Notting- 
2r°e'll:Tnd ^am. On June i8, the day of the fight at Chalgrove

spirit was plainly to be detected here.

they arrived at Lincoln he was no longer there. Going to Hull 
to confer with his father, his movements excited suspicion. 
On the 28th the Mayor of Hull received information of the 
June 29. plot, and captured him in his bed. The fortifica- 
theTwo tions were at once placed in the safe hands of the 
Hothams. citizens themselves. Sir John learning what had 
taken place, flung himself on horseback and succeeded in 
effecting his escape, but he was knocked off his horse at 
Beverley and brought back as a prisoner to Hull. Father and 
son were carried on board a ship and sent off by sea to London.'' 
If the Hothams had succeeded they would probably have 
been welcomed at Oxford as effusively as Hurry had been. 
, , As it was, the imprisonment of the man who had 

Royahst first bid defiance to the King was almost a matter of 

opinion 

of the rejoicing. "The rebels,'' wrote Nicholas, "have 

seized him, his son, their wives and children, and 
sent them all prisoners to the rebellious city, London, where 
the justice of God will, I believe, bring him to be punished by 
the same usurped power that at first did encourage him in his 
first act of rebellion ; for falser men than he and his son Hve 
not upon earth." ' 

The arrest of the Hothams was carried out just in time to 
save the Parliamentary cause in the North from ruin. Whilst 
Hotham was embarrassing his colleagues by his turbulence at 
Nottingham, Newcastle, after parting with the Queen, gathered 
his forces for a final blow at the thinned and hard-pressed 
June 22. ranks of the Fairfaxes in the West Riding. On 
House'' June 22 he stormed Howley House, the residence

Bradford. The Fairfaxes knew that their scanty stock of pro- 
visions would avail them for no more than a twelve days' siege. 
On the morning of the 30th they marched out to oppose the 
10,000 men of Newcastle's array with a force of which only 4,oop 
were armed soldiers, though it included an indefinite number

to secure it, if possible, on his way to Hull. Sir Thomas re- 
mained at Bradford in the post of danger and of honour ; but 
after a short resistance he cut his way out, leaving behind him 
most of his followers, and even his wife, as prisoners in New- 
castle's hands. When Bradford was lost, all other towns in

too severe for her childish frame, and she had been left dying, 
as her father verily believed, in a wayside house. 

Sir Thomas's domestic anxieties were soon relieved. On 
the day after his arrival he recovered his child, restored to 
health by a night's sleep, and before long his wife rejoined him, 
sent to him with all courtesy by the stately Newcastle, who 
was too gallant a cavalier to make war on ladies.' 

To have saved Hull was much, far more than in all proba- 
bility the Fairfaxes could have imagined at the time. Yet, at 
least they knew that, with the level expanse before them offer- 
ing no vantage ground to the enemy, and with the broad Hum- 
ber behind them opening out into that sea which was dominated 
by the Parliamentary navy, it would go hard with them if they 
failed in maintaining the post which had been confided to them 
by its own citizens. 

For the present Newcastle could boast that, with the excep- 
tion of Hull, all Yorkshire was in his hands. It seemed that 
Newcastle's his part at least of Charles's strategical plan was now

Essex, who appeared to be afraid of fighting the King, was also 
afraid of fighting the Queen. It is to the credit of Essex's 
thorough loyalty of purpose that no taunts drove him to falter 
in his allegiance to the cause which he had conscientiously 
espoused. 

In the Commons Pym pointed out temperately, but deci- 
sively, the radical weakness of Essex's suggestion, by reminding

of danger.' On the other hand, a reinforcement of 500 horse 
for the Lord General was voted without opposition.'

The consequences of Stamford's defeat at Stratton had 
evolved themselves rapidly. In Devonshire, Plymouth, Dart-

which had served Stamford so ill at Stratton. Such men were 
easily defeated and driven through Wells and over the Mendips. 

So far everything had gone well with Hopton. If his mind 
was weighed down with anxiety, it was not from fear of the 
enemy. The horsemen who followed Hertford and Maurice 
Royalist Were full of energy and courage, but they were 
plunderers, desperate plunderers. As a commander of those 
Cornish soldiers who were as stainless in this matter as even 
Cromwell's troopers, Hopton was gravely dissatisfied with the 
evil which he was powerless to stay, and he was all the more 
vexed because he was himself a native of Somerset, and they 
w^ere his own friends and neighbours who complained in vain 
of the ravages to which they were subjected.' 

Prince Maurice's robber horsemen at least knew how to 
fight. At Chewton, to the north of the Mendips, they found 
June 12. themselves in presence of Waller's army, which had 
chlwton f°'' some little time been established at Bath. The 
Mendip. advantage remained with the Royalists, but neither 
army was as yet prepared to engage in serious hostilities. 
Waller at Waller especially was unwilling to abandon the 
Bath. defensive. His army was weak and ill-provided, and 

he feared to leave Bristol unprotected. West Somerset was, in 
the main, hostile to him, whilst East Somerset, a land of small 
freeholders and thriving industries, was favourable to the Par- 
liamentary cause. 

It was after the fight at Chewton that Waller received from 
Hopton a proposal for a private interview. " Certainly," 
June 16. replied Waller, "my affections to you are so un- 
dencfte" changeable, that hostility itself cannot violate my 
tween friendship to your person. But I must be true to 

and Waller, the cause wherein I serve. The old limitation, usque 
ad aras, holds still, and where my conscience is interested all 
other obligations are swallowed up. I should most gladly 
wait upon you, according to your desire, but that I look upon 
you as engaged in that party beyond the possibility of a retreat, 
and consequently uncapable of being wrought upon by any 
persuasions. And I know the conference could never be so

close between us but that it would take wind, and receive a 
construction to my dishonour. That great God who is the 
searcher of my heart knows with what a sad sense I go on upon 
this service, and with what a perfect hatred I detest this war 
without an enemy ; but I look upon it as sent from God, and 
that is enough to silence all passion in me. The God of 
Heaven in His good time send us the blessing of peace, and 
in the meantime assist us to receive it ! We are both upon 
the stage, and must act such parts as are assigned us in this 
tragedy. Let us do it in a way of honour and without personal 
animosities." ' 

Such was the temper in which the nobler spirits on either 
side had entered on the war. The quarrel had its roots too 

' Cla7-endon St. P. ii. 155. This letter is rightly ascribed by the 
editor to Waller. He says that it ' is the last of six polite letters, all rough 
drafts written in the same hand and on the same paper. They appear, 
most of them, to have been sent from the chief commander of the 
Parliament forces in the West to Sir Ralph Hopton, whose name is 
written on the back of the paper in the same hand.' He is wrong here, 
as a careful examination shows that the name on the back can only 
mean that the person who copied them got them from Hopton, or from 
a collection which had been in Hopton's possession. No. I is written to 
Lord Arundell of Wardour about the custody of his children taken at 
Wardour Castle, probably by Waller, who, as Mr. P'irth reminds me, had 
the custody of Arundell's children. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 speak for them- 
selves. The first begins : • My Lord, upon the assurance of your Excel- 
lency's parole ; ' the second, ' Noble Sir ; ' the third, ' Sir, I have had 
the honour to receive a letter from your Highness.' Undoubtedly 'Your 
Excellency ' was Hertford, ' Noble Sir ' Hopton, and ' Your Highness ' 
Prince Maurice. The first two are on the subject of the exchange of 
Colonel Lunsford — i.e. Colonel Herbert Lunsford, who had been taken 
prisoner by Waller when he captured Malmesbury. The third letter, to 
Prince Maurice, is on a general exchange of prisoners. These letters 
must have been written by Waller after the junction of the three com- 
manders, and hardly earlier than the skirmish at Chewton Mendip. No. 
S, to the same person as No. 2, is to Hertford. Hopton, probably in 
answering No. 3, expressed a wish to see Waller, and it is to this 
request that Waller's letter from which an extract is printed above is an 
answer. Waller's last letter is printed in Polwhele's History of Cornwall, 
i. 98, and evidently taken from a difierent copy from that in the Clarendon 
MSS. It is there signed by Waller and addressed to Sir Ralph Hopton 
«t Wales, i.e. Wells. It is also dated " Bath, June 16, 1643."

deep to be settled otherwise than by the sword. The RoyaHst 
commanders were now the first to move. Sweeping round by 
way of Frome to Bradford-on-Avon, they threw themselves 
March of between Waller and London, and at the same time 
SdH^ton threatened Bath by way of the valley of the Avon, 
Waller's ^^ which the approach is easiest. In Waller, how- 
defence, ever, they had to deal with an able tactician, by the 
Julys, confession of his opponents 'the best shifter and 
Monkton chooser of ground when he was not master of the 
Farieigh. field.' On July 3 they succeeded in drawing a small 
body of the eneniiy out of Monkton Farieigh on the high 
ground to the north of the river, but Waller's main army 
was on the other side of the valley under Claverton Down, 
and they neither dared to cross the river in the face of the 
enemy nor to pursue their way to Bath leaving him in the rear. 
The whole of July 4, the day on which the war-worn 
Fairfaxes were riding into Hull, was spent in manoeuvring. 

At last the Royalists abandoned the line of the

side along the ridge of Lansdown. 

When the morning of the sth dawned the Royalists per- 
ceived that Waller still blocked the way. The road by which 

Hopton hoped to pass was for some three miles the 
Battle of main road from Chippenham to Bristol. At Tog 

Hill another road branches off to the left, dips 
steeply down into a valley, and then ascends with a winding 
course on the opposite side till it reaches the north-western 
end of Lansdown. The height once gained, a level road runs 
along the ridge till the ground falls sharply down to Bath. If 
the Royalist army could gain possession of this ridge all else 
would be comparatively easy. Essex was lying in hopeless 
inactivity at Aylesbury, and from him Waller had no aid to 
expect. 

As the Royalists pushed on through Cold Ashton to Tog 
Hill they could see that Waller intended to contest any attempt 
lo scale the heights of Lansdown. His cannon were planted 
behind a breastwork, and horse and foot were ranged so as

to command every available approach. As he remained 
immovable when Hertford and Hopton drew up their forces 
at Tog Hill, the order to retreat was given. The sight of the 
retiring enemy was too much for Waller to endure. Keeping 
his infantry at their posts, he sent his horse and dragoons in 
pursuit. Amongst them was a newly formed regiment of 
London cavalry, under Sir Arthur Hazlerigg, known popularly 
as the Lobsters, from the complete armour in which they were 
encased on back and breast. At Cold Ashton they found the

enemy halted. The charge of the Lobsters was successful for 
a time, but in the end superior numbers told, and the Parlia- 
mentary horse was driven back to its old position on the edge 
of Lansdown. The victors followed as far as Tog Hill, and 
drew up to examine the position once more. 

To descend into the valley and to climb the guarded heights 
was a formidable task, but the sight of the enemy posted in 
apparent security only exasperated the Cornishmen. " Let us 
fetch off those cannon," they cried to their officers. The 
officers assented, and the nimble feet which had stormed

the heights of Stratton were once more in motion, working 
their way upwards through the woods on either side, in 
which the enemy had placed musketeers to hold the ground. 
The horse, advancing along the road, was less fortunate. 
It was charged and driven back. Then Sir Bevil Grenvile, 
who was stationed with his regiment at Tog Hill, gave 
the word to advance, and descended into the valley. 
Placing his pikemen in the centre, his horse on the open 
ground to the right, and his musketeers on the left, he steadily 
pushed on. It is possible that Grenvile was protected by the 
very steepness of the ascent, and that Waller's cannon could 
not be suflSciently depressed to strike the ascending force. 
The bend of the road to the right was undoubtedly in his 
favour, as it gave him the shelter of a stone wall running 
almost at right angles to the enemy's fire.' It was only on 
approaching the top that the road, sweeping round once more, 
made straight for Waller's position. Then came the real 
struggle of the day. Five times did the Parliamentary cavalry 
charge with all the advantage of the slope, and five times it 
charged in vain. At last the whole Royalist force surged over 
Waller's breastworks. The moment of victory was also the 
moment of sorrow. Of the 2,000 horsemen which had 
marched out of their quarters in the morning, 600 only were 
still in the saddle when the day was gained. The Cornishmen 
were saddened by the fall of their beloved leader. Sir Bevil 
Grenvile, struck down in the thick of the fight. Waller too, 
if beaten, was still formidable. He had withdrawn his cannon 
in time, and had placed them behind a stone wall a little in 
the rear of his old position, breaking it into gaps to serve as 
embrasures. For the rest of the day shots were occasionally 
fired from either side, but neither army ventured to charge the 
other. As night fell the Royalists, ' seated,' as one of those 

' The shelter of the stone wall is mentioned in a contemporary narrative, 
but it was only after a visit to the spot that I understood the importance 
of the bend in the road, which is not noticed by any of the authorities. 
The space to the left is now filled with trees. Only a few are represented 
in Thorpe's map of the environs of Bath, issued in 1771, and I suspect that 
in 1643 the woods were at some little distance from the road.

present expressed it, ' like a heavy stone upon the very brow 
of the hill, which with one hasty charge might well have been 
rolled to the bottom,' watched for every sign of an attack under 
the cover of night. About eleven, a volley of musketry was 
poured into their ranks, and then all was still. A soldier 
creeping forwards found that the enemy's line was deserted. 
Waller had retired to Bath. " We were glad they were gone," 
wrote a Royalist ofiScer, " for if they had not, I know who had 
within an hour." 

The victorious army was too shattered to press on in 
pursuit, and the powder remaining to it was too scanty to make 
a siege of Bath possible. Disputes in their own ranks arose to 
diminish the eflSciency of the force. The Cornishmen had 
had the honour of the day, and they were inclined to depreciate 
the services of the cavalry, which had been called on to fight 
on unfavourable ground. Hazlerigg's Lobsters, too, had shown 
themselves to be possessed of better military qualities than 
were to be found in the cavalry of Essex's army. " Indeed," 
wrote a Royalist who took part in the battle, " had our horse 
been as good as the enemy's, the rebels had never gone off the 
field unharmed." ' 

The retreat of the Royalists in the morning was saddened 
by an unexpected misfortune. Hopton, who had been 
, , g slightly wounded on the day of the fight, was struck 
Hopton down and seriously injured by the explosion of a 
by an ex. waggon which Contained almost the whole of the 
p osion. remaining stock of ammunition. If the Cornishmen 
loved Grenvile as the most genial of their countrymen, they 
revered Hopton as a capable commander and as a man of 
unstained probity. " Our horse," was the mournful comment, 
" was bad before, but now worse ; our foot drooped for their 
lord whom they loved, and that they had not powder enough 
10 defend him." That night they spent at Marshfield, and 
the two following at Chippenham, that their wounded general 
might have the needful rest. Then, on an alarm that the

he was unable to hinder the escape of the whole of the

Waller might well think that Hopton's Cornishmen were 
delivered into his hands. On the morning of the nth he laid

and by his direction barricades had been thrown up at the en- 
trances of the streets. The town was, however, unfortified ; of 
powder there was but little remaining, and the stock of match 
was entirely exhausted. Fertile in expedients, Hopton ordered 
the ropes which supported the sacking of the beds of the towns- 
men to be collected and boiled in resin. Yet, if Hopton could 
provide match he could not provide powder, and unless succour 
should arrive the resistance of Devizes could not be long pro- 
tracted. " The Cornish," wrote Waller and Hazlerigg, 
■ " defend it bravely. We hope that God will scatter, if 
not destroy, this mighty army of the West. He hath wrought 
wonders for us, and we hope the Lord will keep us from that 
great strength they expect from Oxford." The evening of the

whole of the Parliamentary cavalry rushed madly down the hill 
side, ' where never horse went down or up before.' Waller 
joined in the flight, and his infantry, abandoned by their com- 
rades and their general, knew their case to be hopeless when 
they saw Hopton's Cornishmen sallying out to take them in the 
rear. Of i,8oo footmen 600 were slain and the remainder led 
off as prisoners. For all practical purposes Waller's army was 
annihilated.'

CHAPTER IX. 

BRISTOL AND GAINSBOROUGH. 

Although the news from Roundway Down, following close 
upon the news from Adwalton Moor, was a terrible blow to the 
1643. Parliamentary leaders, it brought with it no thought 
The effect of of surrender. It rather gave hfe to that scheme for 
wts"^-*' calling in the Scots which they had long entertained, 
st="-- but which even the House of Commons had hitherto 

shrunk from putting into execution. 

There can be little doubt that between Pym and Argyle a 
good understanding had for some time existed. It was under 

jj^ ^ Argyle's influence that the various bodies which to- 
A Conven- gether acted as the government of Scotland resolved 
Estates on May 10 to summon a Convention of Estates — 
summone . ^ j^.^^ ^^ informal Parliament — to meet on June 22 
without the royal consent' 

Against this resolution Hamilton had pleaded in vain. When 
it was taken he characteristically dissuaded Charles from stand- 
ing upon his dignity and prohibiting the meeting. It 
opposition! was possiblc, he thought, that the Convention might, 

June 5. after all, decHne to interfere in England, and it was 

SaiS'the certainly not likely that it would pay any attention to 

^oWHtin' orders from the King commanding it to abstain from 

the Con- sitting.^

Straightforwardness, unhappily, was never to be 
Montrose's countcd on in Charles, and some time before the 
plans. Convention met a fresh discovery filled with alarm 

the minds of even the most trustful. Although the counsel 
given by Montrose at York had been rejected by the King, it had

probably not been so decisively rejected as to lead its author to 
suppose that his plan might not be taken up again if Hamilton's 
mission failed. However this njay have been, there can be no 
doubt that Montrose's plan of action contemplated, not merely 
a rising in Scotland against the Presbyterian Government, but 
the bringing over of Irish Catholic troops as well. Of the Scot- 
tish Royalists, Nithsdale and Aboyne had been prominent at the 
conference at York, whilst Antrim, whose vanity and incapacity 
had once drawn down upon him the weight of Strafford's sar- 
casm, was also present to expound the chances of obtaining aid 
from Ireland. Towards the end of May, Antrim, as he was 
landing in his native country, was captured and carried before 
Monro. 

In Antrim's pocket were found compromising letters from 
Nithsdale and Aboyne, and subsequent examinations elicited 
Discovery an acknowledgment that plans existed for a rising in 
co^^pon-' Scotland, to be backed by the Irish Catholics. There 
dence. ^^g indeed no evidence that the plans had been actu- 

ally adopted by Charles, but the undoubted fact that he was at 
the time engaged in negotiations with the confederates at Kil- 
kenny would be accepted as a confirmation of the worst sus- 
Rumours in picions. It was freely stated in Scotland that Antrim 
Scotland. j^^^ offered to bribe Monro with 5,000/. to join that 
English army in Ireland which Charles intended to employ 
against the Parliamentary forces in England, and that if this 
offer were refused the English and Irish were to be incited to 
join together in order to fall upon the Scottish troops in Ulster.' 
It was also believed that, when Monro's army had been got rid 
of, the combined forces were to cross over to Cumberland, where 
they would receive support from Nithsdale, whose family was 
powerful on the Western Borders, whilst Hamilton would strike 
a blow for the King in the centre of Scotland, and Montrose 
would rouse the North.'' Baillie, in reporting what he heard, 

' If this appears too visionary, it must be remembered that there is 
undoubted evidence that a similar proposal was made some months later.

did not give full credence to every part of the story, and it la 
evident from the place assigned in it to Hamilton that it repre- 
sents rather the intentions of the schemers than a delitiite plan 
accepted by the King. Opinion in Scotland was, however, cer- 
tain to outrun the actual facts on which it was based, and it was 
June, still more inflamed when it was known that in the 
bewem early days of June Montrose was at Aberdeen, holding 
Montrose ^y^^^ conference with Huntly, whose son, Aboyne, 
Huntiy. had been an active participator in the consultations 
at York.' 

After this there was no hesitation in Scotland. On June 9, 
the detection of the plot was announced by the Council. The 

thought of the necessity of an alliance with the 
Effect in' English Parliament gained ground at once. Even 

if Antrim's correspondence could have been ex- 
plained away, Charles's understanding with the Kilkenny 
Catholics was incompatible with an understanding with the 
Edinburgh Presbyterians. Under the influence of the recent 

disclosures the elections to the Convention were 
tions in held. The gentry of the counties and the townsmen 
Scotland. ^j- ^.j^^ boroughs sent up representatives all but 
unanimously in favour of a military alliance with the Parliament 
at Westminster. When on June 22 the Estates met, it was to 

no purpose that Hamilton offered in the King's

^une x6. preparations. On the 26th they declared themselves 

^ciare^^ a free Convention, and two days afterwards they 

a free Con- ordered that copies of the documents seized from 

Antrim should be forwarded to Westminster.' 

The news of the discovery outran the ofScial information. 

On June 27 it was known in the English House of Commons.

had happened during these miserable calamities and civil wars 
of England, because it seemed now that there was a fixed

army once more on English soil, and the Scots were but asked 
to contribute counsel and advice, and to send a select number 
of ministers to take part in the Assembly of Divines which on 
July I was at last to meet at Westminster.^ 

Whatever hesitation remained was swept away by the news 
of disaster from Adwalton Moor and Roundway Down.

Puritan cause would receive a fresh development. 

Much as might be expected from the aid of a Scottish 
army, some time must elapse before it could actually cross the 
border. Pym was well aware that unless the English Parlia- 
ment could do something for its own preservation there would 
be nothing left for the Scots to succour.

there was a strong party in Bristol hostile to himself and to 
the cause for which he fought, and he can hardly be blamed 
if he treated as non-existent the chance that succours might 
reach him from the army of Essex.' Upon his return to 
London he was violently attacked by Prynne, and by 
martial on Piynne's friend, Clement Walker, as a coward and a 
lennes. traitor ; and a court-martial, before which he was 
ultimately brought, sentenced him to death, though only on 
the ground of improper surrender, thus tacitly exonerating him 
from the charges of cowardice and treason. The penalty was 
remitted by Essex, and Fiennes was merely excluded from 
military service, for which he was obviously unfit. 

For the present the question which agitated London was 
rather that of the capacity of Essex himself for command.

to another scheme of no less importance. Sir John Conyers^ 
the lieutenant of the Tower, had asked for leave of absence to 
transfer his family to Holland, or, in other words, for leave to

the recent defeats. Charles had just prohibited his loyal

Inspiriting as the zeal manifested in the City was to Pym, 
a grave danger lay in the general distrust of Essex with which 
it was accompanied. The choice of Waller as the City

be brought to declare against the continuation of the war, and 
they knew that if he declared for peace at the head of his 
Hopes of army, resistance to his commands would be impos- 
the Peace- sible. Essex, however, was of too loyal a nature 

to take part in a mere intrigue. On the 28th he 
Txt^ais addressed to the Houses an unexcited statement of 
of Essex. ^j^g position in which he was. He explained that 
he had but 3,000 foot and 2,500 horse fit for service. If he 
was expected to do anything he must have reinforcements, 
and money must be punctually provided. He then touched 
upon the sore point. Men must not be attracted by promises 
of higher pay to a new army as long as the old one was in its 
present condition. Nor should any commander in England 
receive a commission except from the Lord General himself. 
The causes of the disaster in the West should be fully investi- 
gated.' Every word in this paper was thoroughly reasonable. 
Unity of command and unity of plan were the indispensable 
conditions of success. If the mutual distrust which had kept 
back the commanders in the Northern Midlands from hurrying 
to the succour of the Fairfaxes in Yorkshire was to be repeated 
in the South, a more crushing blow than that of Adwalton 
Moor would not be long postponed. 

Though Pym was already suffering from the disease which 
was before long to put an end to his labours, he roused himself 

to profit alike by the zeal of the City and by the 
Pym's inter- dcvotion of Esscx. It might have been well if Essex 

could be superseded by a more spirited commander, 
but if that could not be, the powers for which he asked must 
be willingly accorded to him. By August 2 all his demands, 
save one, had been granted. The inquiry into the cause of the 
failure in the West, which would only have given rise to dan- 
gerous recriminations, was refused, but Waller, who was to be 
placed at the head of an army raised in defence of the home 
counties, was to receive his commission from the Lord General, 
who would thus be set free to operate in the West. To forget 
the past and to join in united action was the charge which the 
Commons, under the sway of Pym, gave to the rival com-

Bristol had come to emphasise its necessity. ' 

Whilst the Commons were bending their energies to the 
prosecution of the war, the Lords, amongst whom the Peace-

mittee which had already been appointed to carry to Essex the, 
resolutions of the preceding day, no doubt intending that Pym 
should use his tact and authority in opposition to Holland.^

received its instructions, and was resisted in a division in which 21 voted

assumed by both Houses at the time of the negotiations at 
Oxford was to be entirely abandoned. Charles was again to 
be placed in possession of his revenues, of his navy, of his forts 
and magazines. Hull and Plymouth, Portsmouth, and the 
Tower of London itself would be his without striking a blow, 
in mere confidence that he would entrust them to such persons 
as would be faithful both to himself and to the Parliament. Par- 
liament was to be reconstituted by the readmission of all expelled 
members, so as to place the Royalists in a majority in the 
House of Lords, and to secure the triumph in the House of 
Commons for a majority which would be composed of the 
pure Royalists and of some at least of the members of the 
party of peace. The Assembly of Divines, which had been in 
session ever since the beginning of July, was to be treated as 
non-existent, and a new Assembly, which would be summoned 
with the King's approbation, was to take in hand the settlement 
of the Church. There were to be provisos for the maintenance 
of the privileges of Parliament, and for the disbandment of the 
armies, as well as for the trial of delinquents accused before 
January i, 1642.' Such propositions as these were not a com- 
promise but a capitulation, and Essex, dissatisfied

1643 EXCITEMENT IN THE CITY 185 

In the City the news of this vote created the greatest con- 
sternation. The quarrel had long ceased to be one which a 
Parliamentary majority could decide. Even if the

tion in the propositions had been far more equitable than they 
' ^' were, to treat at that moment would, by discouraging 

all military effort, make further resistance impossible. Unless 
D'Ewes was misinformed, it was resolved at a meeting, in which 
Lord Mayor Pennington took a prominent part, to make use of 
force, in case of necessity, against a party which was itself look- 
ing to the Lord General and his army for aid. Northumber-

Peace-party, knowing that the sword of Essex was no longer 
available, gave up all hope of further resistance. As Holland,

On the following morning the approaches of the House were 
beset by a crowd of women, with white ribbons in their hats,

women. jj^gy pressed on to the door of the House, battering 
it for an hour, and vociferously demanding that Pym, Strode, 
and the other Roundheads should be delivered to them in order 
that they might throw them into the Thames. At last the guards 
attempted to clear the passages by firing powder. The women, 
seeing no one hurt, imagined that they had no bullets to fear, and, 
filling their aprons with stones and brickbats, began to pelt the 
soldiers. The endurance of the soldiers was at an end, and they 
fired — this time with loaded arms — killing two men, one of whom 
was encouraging the crowd. The women were not to be fright- 
ened by the killing of men, and continued shouting, " Give us 
those traitors that were against peace, that we may tear them to 
pieces ! Give us that dog Pym ! " At last a small body of Waller's 
horse came to the rescue from the City. The women at once 
rushed at the new-comers, calling them Waller's dogs, and at- 
tempted to tear the ribbons from their hats. In self-defence the men 
laid about them, at first with the flat of their swords, and then, 
when thisdidnotclear the way, with the edge. Sorne of the women 
were trampled down, and a few were wounded. When the rest 
saw blood flow they shrank back. A troop of horse coming up 
finally drove them away with as little violence as possible, though

unfortunately a young woman passing from one side of Palace 
Yard to the other was accidentally shot by a trooper. One at 
least of those who were wounded subsequently died.' 

D'Ewes, who witnessed the scene, contrasted bitterly the 
harsh treatment of the women with the leniency shown to the 
men two days before. He took no notice of the fact that the 
women threw stones and brickbats, and that the men contented 
themselves with ugly looks. 

As soon as these tumults were quieted the Commons 
adopted a statement of the reasons which had led them to 
August lo. reject the propositions. Their special arguments 
gitm°by were of little value. The assertion with which they 
monSS" concluded was incontrovertible. " We could not," 
the pro? argued the Commons, " in this time of imminent 
positions. and pressing danger, divert our thoughts or our time 
from those necessary provisions as are to be made for the safety

Lightfoot's Works, xiii. 9. D'Ewes's remarks are characteristic of the 
temper in which he wrote : " No man can excuse the indiscreet violence 
of these women, but the remedy used against them by the procurement of 
John Pym and some others, v/ho were enemies to all kind of peace, was 
most cruel and barbarous ; for, not content to have them suppressed by 
the ordinary foot guard, which had been sufficient, there were divers horse- 
men called down, who hunted the said women up and down the back 
Palace Yard, and wounded them with their swords and pistols with no less 
inhumanity than if they had been brute beasts, of which wounds some of 
the poor women afterwards died ; and one of those horsemen, being a 
profane fellow, and bearing an old grudge to a religious honest man, 
named John Norman, who sold spectacles without Westminster Hall gate 
on the east side thereof, did shoot his daughter to death as she was peace- 
ably going upon an errand, for which wilful murder the said father could 
never to this day procure justice to be done upon the malefactor." The 
account given in Rushivorth says : "Unhappily a maidservant, that had 
nothing to do in the tumult, was shot as she passed over the churchyard. 
The trooper that did it was sent to the Gate House in order to his trial for 
het death, but he alleged that his pistol went off by mischance."

hope, present others at this time, when we have cause to doubt 
his late success will make his royal assent more difficult." * 

This was, after all, the true reason why there could be no 
negotiation. Those who believed that even the continuance 
of civil war with all its miseries was better than the abandon- 
ment of the cause for which they were contending must fight 
on to the end. " In all the propositions tendered to us by the 
Lords," said Glyn in the critical debate, " there is no care for 
religion ; " ^ and Glyn's words only gave utterance to the 
general opinion of those by whose votes the propositions had 
been rejected. 

The necessity of strengthening the defence to the uttermost 
was becoming more visible every day. Whilst the Houses 
Pro res "^^^^ debating, the King had been making rapid 
of the strides both in the North and in the West. On 

July 2 2 Parliament had confirmed Lord Fairfax in 
FairfL'at the government of Hull,' but it was hardly thought 
"""• likely at Westminster that Hull could stand in the 

way of Newcastle's southern march. On the 25th the Commons 
July 25. gave assurance to the Committee which managed

had surprised Gainsborough on the 20th, and who was threat- 
ened by a strong force of cavalry under Charles Cavendish, 
Newcastle's young and gallant kinsman.^ 

Strategically, the position of Gainsborough was of no slight 
importance. Standing as it did in the way of Newcastle's ad- 
vance, whether he wished to support his friends at Newark or 
to assail his enemies at Lincoln, its seizure by the Parliamentary 
commander was not likely long to pass unchallenged. When

600 horse and dragoons. At Grantham he was joined by 
Meldrum from Nottingham, and a body of troops from Lincoln 
July 14. met him at North Scarle. The combined forces now 
SkT™'" under Meldrum's command were strong enough to 
Ho?se'°^ be safe from a flank attack from Newark, and on the 
juiyzs. morning of the 28th they came up with Cavendish's 
boraugh horse, posted on the edge of a sandy plateau, where 
fight. tjjg ground slopes steeply down, a little to the north 

of Lea on the road to Gainsborough. Picking their way with 
difficulty amongst the rabbit holes, they gained the upper level, 
and, charging the main body of the Royalists, drove them in 
headlong rout. For six miles the horsemen from Lincoln and 
Nottingham chased the flying enemy as Rupert had swept the 
rout before him at Edgehill. Cromwell was not among the 
pursuers. Looking round as soon as the enemy began to fly, 
he perceived that Cavendish had kept one regiment in reserve, 
and was preparing to fall upon the rear of the unthinking 
victors. Rallying his own troops, he allowed Cavendish to 
pass him, and then galloping after him charged the Royalist 
commander from behind. In an instant Cavendish's regiment 
was driven headlong down the hill, and he himself, the young 
and gallant flower of a noble family, was knocked off his horse 
in a bog at the foot of the slope, where he was killed by one of 
Cromwell's officers. 

The day's work was not yet at an end. Powder and pro- 
visions were being thrown into Gainsborough, when news was 

brought that a small Royalist force was approaching 
borough from the north. Taking with them 400 of Wil- 

loughby's foot, the Parliamentary commanders sallied 
out to meet it. In an instant they found themselves face to

or nine several removes, the enemy following at their heels, 
and they, though their horses were exceedingly tired, retreated 
in this order near carbine shot of the enemy." The whole 
force reached Gainsborough with the loss of only two men.' 

Unimportant as it was in its immediate results, this skirmish 
of Gainsborough, as an indication of the future course of events,

Indications ... 

of future of this eventful year. Here at least was that which 
°^' Essex had failed to create or to discover, a cavalry 
as highly disciplined as it was enterprising. Here, too, was a 
commander capable of making the utmost use of his materials, 
prompt in action, sober in judgment, undaunted in the hour 
of adversity. Potentially, the combat at Gainsborough was 
the turning point of the war. For the moment it led to 
nothing. The best of cavalry under the ablest of commanders 
was useless behind stone walls, and Cromwell rode off, leaving 
July 30. Gainsborough to its fate. On the 30th it capitulated 
^njugh *° Newcastle.^ Willoughby's force melted away, and 
capitulates, hg -^^s forced to abandon Lincoln and to retire dis- 
comfited to Boston. 

Cromwell realised the danger to the full. " It's no longer 
disputing," he wrote to the Committee at Cambridge, "but out 
August 6. instantly all you can. Almost all our foot have 
Snrfor" quitted Stamford ; there is nothing to interrupt an 
help- enemy but our horse, that is considerable. You 

must act lively ; do it without distraction. Neglect no means." 
Stamford he was soon driven to abandon as untenable. Sending 
his foot to Spalding in order to hold out a hand to Willoughby, 
as well as to guard the fen country round Boston, he took up 
his own quarters at Peterborough, that he might check New- 
castle's advance into the associated counties.' It was not

merely the fortune of the associated counties that was at stake. 
If Newcastle could break through Cromwell's scanty band of 
troopers, London, and with it the whole Parliamentary cause; 
would be gravely imperilled. 

The Houses had not been unmindful of Cromwell in his 
danger. On August 9, three days after his almost despairing 

August 9. letter was written, and two days after the rejection 
^kS"b^the °f ^^ peace propositions, the Commons resolved 
Houses. that the infantry of the associated counties should 
be raised to 10,000, and that such of the divines of the 
Assembly as had their homes in those counties should go down to 
rouse the people to be stirring in their own defence. Scarcely less 
important was the resolution to appoint Manchester as the com- 
mander over the army of the Eastern Association. Something 
had been done by the appointment of Meldrum, and the failure 
in July had at least not been disgraced by those intestine dis- 
cords which had produced the failure in June. Meldrum, how- 
ever, good soldier as he was, could not speak with the authority 
of an English earl, even though that earl had as little knowledge 
as Manchester had of the ordering of armies in the field. On 
the loth the Lords concurred, and a request was sent to Essex 

August 10. to give a commision to Manchester as Major-General 
to command of the army of the associated counties, ^ a request 
the eSto ^^'•^ which Essex at once complied. On the same 
Association. (Jay, to mark the sense entertained by the Houses of 
the growing dangers of the situation, an ordinance appeared

was well fortified, and Puritanism was strong amongst its 
townsmen, but the terror of Bristol was upon them. The 
King's soldiers, they had been told, were no ordinary warriors.

CHAPTER X. 

GLOUCESTER AND NEWBURY. 

So little were the Parliamentary armies prepared to offer 
adequate resistance to the forces now arrayed against them, 

that posterity has pointed with singular unanimity to 
A critical the first weck in August as marking the instant when 
moment. ^ yirilc lesolutioH on the King's part would probably 
have changed the fortunes of the war. To understand why 
that resolution was not taken by Charles is to understand why 
his adversaries, rather than himself, became masters of the 
field. 

Both sides had known how to avail themselves of the local 
feehng which was still strong in England. It was a feeling 

which had proved of excellent service as long as the 
ing on struggle remained local. Fairfax's Yorkshiremen had 

fought hard against Yorkshiremen under Newcastle, 
and Hopton's Cornishmen, when the fate of their own county 
was at stake, had overpowered Stamford's mixed multitude at 
Braddock Down and Stratton. The startling victories of the 
Royalists in June and July had made it incumbent on Charles 
to play a bolder game, and to combine his scattered forces for 
an attack on the central oosition of the enemy. Was it to be 
expected that the men who had hitherto served him well would 
march at his bidding far from their own homes, and would re- 
member that they were Englishmen first, and Yorkshiremen or 
Cornishmen only in a secondary sense ? 

Before the end of August it was evident that the men of 
the North were not to be relied on for general service. New- 
castle found that his Yorkshire levies refused to leave the 
county as long as their own fields and houses were en-

dangered by forays from Hull. Whether he wished it or not, 
Newcastle was forced to lay siege to Hull as a preliminary to 
August, further operations,' and Hull, open as it was to the 
dilwsteck, ^s^' where the Parliamentary fleet was supreme, 
s^geto^ would hardly be overpowered as easily as Bristol, 
Hull. to which access by sea could readily be prevented. 

Manchester, it seemed, would have leisure to recruit his army. 

To the men of the West, Plymouth was all that Hull was 
to the men of the North. The Cornishmen who had followed 
Hopton to victory would follow him no longer,

Charles's original design of advancing on three lines was

in the rear of the Royalist advance was imposed upon Charles 
by necessity. 

Scarcely less fatal than the predominance of local over 
national patriotism was the ever-increasing discord between 
the Royalist commanders. Alike in the cabinet and in the 
field, those who wished to carry on the war with a view to 
eventual peace, and who wished to preserve intact the constitu- 
Divisions tional gains of the early months of the Long Parlia- 
RS°afist *° ment, found themselves opposed by men who cared 
leaders. nothing for the constitution, who as counsellors 
dragged the King into foreign alliances and Irish negotiations,

thought that Newcastle did not wish to go where he would no longer be

and who in carrying on the war were soldiers first and 
citizens afterwards, if indeed they were citizens at all. At 
Oxford, Digby and Jermyn were the main props of a disastrous 
policy which found its chief advocate in the Queen, so ardent 
in her husband's cause, yet so ignorant of all that it befitted 
her to know. In the camp the two foreign princes, Rupert and 
Maurice, were the hope of those who believed war to be the 
affair of soldiers only, and who derided the claim of civilians to 
be treated with even common consideration. 

Scarcely had Bristol surrendered, when the controversy, 
long smouldering, burst out into a flame. Rupert was in 
Dispute command of the troops which had been brought 
Rupert'and ^om Oxford. Hertford, on the other hand, had, 
Hertford. early in the war, been appointed Lord-Lieutenant of 
the counties in which Bristol was situated, and he therefore 
regarded Rupert as a mere auxiliary in the army of which he 
was, in virtue of his office, nominally in command, though 
Hopton was its real leader. In the face of these claims, 
Rupert had signed the articles of capitulation without con- 
sulting Hertford, and Hertford, to vindicate his authority, had 
named Hopton as governor of the city without consulting 
Rupert. Rupert immediately wrote to the King, without 
mentioning Hertford's action, to ask for the governorship for 
himself, and Charles, ignorant of the facts, at once complied 
with his nephew's wishes. So bitter was the feeling 
chiksat'' aroused, that Charles visited Bristol to allay the 
Bristol. storm. Hopton, as ever, anxious to remove the 
causes of strife, offered to accept the post to which Hertford 
had named him, as Lieutenant-Governor under the Prince ; 
and Charles, on the transparent pretext of needing Hertford's 
counsels, carried him to Oxford and not long afterwards 
raised Hopton to the peerage. 

The conduct of Maurice was even worse than that of his 

^. brother Rupert. Carnarvon, after subjugating Dor-

between setshirc, was domg his best to win over the popu- 

Maurice and lation by equitable treatment and the good discipline

Maurice appear upon the scene as Carnarvon's superior officcrj 
than fields and homssteads were recklessly abandoned to 
the plunderings of the Prince's followers. Indignant at the 
wrong done to those to whom he had plighted his word, 
Carnarvon hurried to Charles to complain of his nephew's mis- 
conduct. Charles may have sympathised with Carnarvon, 
but he had no remedy to offer. Maurice was the King's 
nephew and Rupert's brother, and he must not be called to 
account. He was to continue in command of the force which, 
now that Dorsetshire had submitted, was to be employed to 
reduce the ports of Devonshire.' 

Whilst Charles was still at Bristol it was resolved, after 
mature deliberation, that the main army, instead of advanc- 
Gioucester '"S upon London should undertake the siege of 
to be Gloucester. Again and again it has been repeated 

that this resolution was the ruin of Charles's cause. 
No doubt, if he had had his whole army well in hand — if his 
main bod)', pushing steadily along the valley of the Thames, 
Was this could have been supported by a forward movement 
ru1n'o""°to °^ Newcastle against the Eastern Association on his 
Charles? igft, and if Hopton or Maurice could have swept 
across Hampshire and Sussex on his right, it would have been 
desperate folly to linger round an isolated fortress like that of 
Gloucester. If, however, this could not be done— if Charles 
had neither the authority nor the firmness of purpose requisite 
— if the cries of the populations of Yorkshire on the; one side, 
and of Devon and Cornwall on the other, were not to be 
disregarded — if Newcastle must needs tarry round the walls of 
Hull, and Maurice round the walls of Exeter and Plymouth, it 
was only in consistency with the general operations of the 
army that Charles should clear away the enemy's force behind 
him, to prepare for a united advance on some future day. No 
doubt, when that day came, it would probably be found that 
the time for successful action had passed away, but it was also 
true that when Charles resolved to besiege Gloucester it had 
already passed away. For him to advance to London unsup- 
ported was plainly useless.'

Nor were there wanting reasons for the belief that the 
siege of Gloucester was a less formidable task than it ulti- 
Conditionof Hiately proved to be. A letter from Massey, the 
Gioucesier. governor of the town, had on August i been read 
in the House of Commons. " Our wants," he wrote, " are so 
great, and this city so averse to us, that our power cannot

complaints. ^quJjJ (Jq^ jf Q^,f regiment might have equalled the 
city in strength ; but now, what with the general discontent of 
both, of the city soldiers and our own, we stand at present 
as betrayed unless speedily your care prevent it. Alderman 
Pury and some few of the citizens, I dare say, are still cordial 
to us, but I fear ten for one to incline the other way. If 
your supply come speedily you may have hopes to call 
Gloucester still yours ; if not, I have lost mine, for above our- 
selves we cannot act." ' 

It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Massey's despair- 
ing appeal was intended to cover a contemplated act of treachery. 
There is strong reason to believe that he was already

that this strange scene had its serious side. Gloucester must 
be won by force if it was to be won at all.' To Charles, even

him more strongly than before that it was impossible for the 
Northern army to march southwards till Hull was taken.^

to Oxford. Of the few peers remaining at Westminster, seven

taken an active part in the Parliamentary resistance.

warm welcome to the deserters ; but the Queen was furious, 
and the jealousy always felt of new converts was strong amongst 
the old supporters of the Crown. Never was the belief in the 
hopelessness of the Parliamentary cause stronger at Oxford 
than at the opening of the siege of Gloucester. " I cannot

success was now easy, and regretted the delay at Gloucester as 
unnecessarily postponing the day of triumph. This latter 
sentiment reached its height in the mind of the Queen, who 
had thrown all her weight into the scale for an immediate ad- 
vance upon London, and was mortified to find that her husband, 
as she believed, had followed Rupert's advice in preference to 
hers. In the mood in which she was she had nothing but 
contempt for the renegade peers, who had fled to Oxford for 
safety after demonstrating their incapacity to forward the royal 
cause at Westminster. 

Charles, therefore, resolved to visit Oxford to pacify his 
wife, and to take a resolution upon the conduct to be ob- 
August 16. served towards the fugitives. He found the Queen's 
visks^x? views everywhere in the ascendant. The whole

urged that Bedford and Holland should be treated with scorn.

that to receive the fugitives well would be to encourage others 
to follow their example. Charles took a middle course, which

hopes of restoration to the post of Groom of the Stole which 
he had formerly held in the royal household, writhed under 
the treatment to which he was subjected. Refusing to acknow- 
ledge that he had committed an offence by siding with rebels, 
and imagining that Charles would, without any request of his 
or any form of apology for the past, replace him in an office 
which had once been his, and which was still vacant, he

became a laughing-stock to the whole Court. Northumber- 
land, who had been watching affairs from a distance, was not 
encouraged to follow Holland's example by the tidings which 
reached him in his stately seclusion at Petworth, and ultimately 
found his way back to his place in the Parliament at West- 
minster. No one else amongst the friends of peace attempted 
the thankless journey to Oxford.' 

Whilst Charles's Court was thus distracted by petty jealousies, 
in London all thoughts were set upon the momentous task of 

the relief of Gloucester. Now that Pym was sure of 
relieve Essex, nothing was to be left untried to provide him 

with the money and the clothing which his soldiers 
sorely needed. Two thousand recruits were, if necessary, to 
be pressed to fill his ranks, and six regiments of London 
trained bands to be sent forth under his standard. The for- 
mation of Waller's new army could wait till Gloucester was 
safe. To supply pay for the special service an ordinance was 
August i8. issued on the i8th commanding every inhabitant of 
^an of fifty London rated on the subsidy books, to advance as

plainly, to extirpate the royal family and utterly to subvert

Marten's imprisonment would not alter the fact that the

Preparations King. London was now about to throw its sword 
in London, j^jo jj^g scalc. Wherever Londoners had fought they 
had quitted themselves like men. At Edgehill, at Brentford, 
and at Lansdown they had borne the brunt of the enemy's

attack, and their defeat at Roundway Down was probably due 
to a defect of leadership rather than to a failure in their own 
courage. London now made itself ready for a supreme effort. 
Every shop was closed, that no man might plead the calls of 
business as a bar to the fulfilment of duty. The pulpits rang 
with exhortations to go forth to the help of the Lord against 
the mighty. Patriotic and religious emotions beat in unison. 

On August 22 Essex reviewed 8,000 men on Hounslow 
Heath, ready to start on the perilous enterprise. On the 26th 
he set out from his last station at Colnbrook. As he 
Mar?hV ' marched on fresh reinforcements joined him, and 
^^°^' after a few days he was at the head of about 15,000 

soldiers, well clothed and well provided. No longer condemned 
to aimless manoeuvres, their hearts beat high in the prospect 
of definite work. Essex pressed steadily on by way of 
Aylesbury, sweeping round Oxford to the north. Soon he 
found himself in an enemy's country, in which Wilmot's 
cavalry hung about his left flank. Wilrftot's attacks were 
Sept. 4. repelled without difficulty, and on September 4, 
Rupert's''^ as the Parliamentary army entered Gloucestershire 
attack. at Stow-on-the-Wold, -it had to bear a fiercer and 

more sustained attack from Rupert. Rupert's cavalry, how- 
ever, with all its vigour, was no match for a complete army, 
and it was compelled to retire baffled from its gallant attempt. 
An effort made to induce Essex to negotiate was as unsuccessful 
as the effort to defeat him. He had no commission, he said, 
to treat, but to relieve Gloucester. " No propositions ! " was 
the cry caught up by rank after rank at the appearance of the 
messenger.' 

Rupert had calculated that Essex would hardly advance 
so far. On the open uplands of the Cotswolds his superiority 
Essex on the '"^ Cavalry could make itself felt, and the flocks, 
Cotswolds. -vyhich formed the wealth of the district, had been 
already swept off by the King's foragers. The march of the 
Parliamentary army was a rough one for soldiers unused to 
war. Food and water were alike scarce. " Such straits and

hardships," wrote a sergeant in one of the London regiments, 
" our citizens formerly knew not ; yet the Lord that called us 
to do the work enabled us to undergo such hardships as He 

brought us to.'' There was no such spirit as this 
ists before in Charles's camp before Gloucester. The nobler 

hearts were weary of the conditions under which 
they were fighting. Carnarvon had turned back from Dorset- 
shire, sickened with the cruelty and perfidy of his comrades. 
Chillingworth, after attempting by day to turn his knowledge 
to account by suggesting a mode of directing the siege works 
after the fashion of the ancient Romans, found relief by night 
in disputing with Falkland on religious subjects in a smoky 
hut.' Falkland, who, when 'sitting amongst his friends often, 
after a deep silence and frequent sighs, would with a shrill and 
sad accent ingeminate the word " Peace ! peace ! " and would 
passionately profess that the very agony of the war, and the view 
of the calamities and desolation which the kingdom did and must 
endure, took his sleep from him and would shortly break his 
heart,' was exposing himself recklessly to danger, partly, 
perhaps, as he said, 'that all might see that his impatiency 
for peace proceeded not from pusillanimity ; ' ''■ partly, too, 
because he had lost all sympathy with the world in which he 
lived.

at an end, and before long Charles's army was in full retreat in 
the direction of Painswick. 

The night before had been rough and stormy, and the sound 
of the cannon fired by Essex from Prestbury Hill to give the 
joyful intelligence- of his approach had not been heard by the 
beleaguered citizens. With the light of the morning Essex 
learned that he had not come in vain, as he looked over the 
green valley of the Severn, and descried the grey tower of the 
cathedral standing out amidst the drifting smoke from the 
burning camp, and the dark masses of the Royalist army in 
full retreat. There was no need for him to hasten now. 
Driving a small force of the enemy out of Cheltenham, at that 
time a petty market town, he gave his troops the rest which they 

sorely needed. On the 8th he marched into Glou- 
Essex enters ccster amidst the ringing cheers of the citizens, who 

but for him would have been at the mercy of their 
enemies. The spirit in which the defence of the city and the 
operations of the relieving army had been conducted was 
summed up in words soon to be inscribed on one of the reno- 
vated gates which had been injured by the Royalists' shot : 
' A city assailed by man but saved by God.' • 

Baffled just as he fancied himself certain of success, Charles 
had been driven from Gloucester. Local tradition tells how, 

seated on a stone by the wayside at Painswick, he 
Chariesat was asked by one of his sons when they were Xo go 

home. " I have no home to go to," is said to have 
been the desponding reply.^ If the words were truly reported 
they can hardly have been more than the expression of a pass- 
ing feeling. Disappointing as his failure to take Gloucester 
. . had been, Charles had now the hope of securing 
taryposi- a prize far more valuable than Gloucester. His 

intention in breaking up from before the city had 
been to fight Essex, not to avoid him.* If he had offered battle

in front of Gloucester he would have had every disadvantage 
to contend with. His superiority of cavalry would have availed 
him little amongst the hedgerows of the valley, whereas every- 
thing would be in his favour on the wide expanse of the 
Cotswolds. He was even in a better position now than he 
would have been if he had left Gloucester some days earlier, 
and had supported Rupert with his whole army at Stow on-the- 
Wold. He was in easy communication with his base of opera- 
tions at Oxford, whilst the enemy, short of supplies, was cut 
off from London. Whoever may have been the adviser on 
whom the direction of Charles's movements depended, he had 
shown himself to be a strategist of no ordinary skill. If the 
soldierlike qualities of the royal troops could make good the 
expectations of the King, Essex could hardly escape a great 
disaster, far more decisive than Waller's disaster at Roundway 
Down. 

During the few days which followed the raising of the siege 

the Royalist army was encouraged by favourable news from the 

West. Before the end of August the townsmen of Barnstaple 

and Bideford were disgracefully beaten by Sir John 

28-5^' Digby at Torrington, and surrendered the two 

of Ba?ii" towns without further resistance. An attempt made 

Itdiford'' ^y Warwick to relieve Exeter from the sea failed, 

and on September 4 the chief city of the West gave 

Surrender itself up to Princc Maurice. To the westward of 

Poole, the only places still holding out against the 

King ' were Lyme, Dartmouth, and Plymouth, with the isolated 

post of Wardour Castle, which, earlier in the year, had been 

wrested by Ludlow from the brave and beautiful Lady Blanche 

Arundell. 

That Plymouth was not already in his hands was a source 
of great disappointment to Charles. The governor. Sir Alex- 
ander Carew, was one of those who, like Cholmley 
ckriti and the Hothams, had taken up arms for the Par- 

fo'bSray liament on political grounds. As the conflict as-

discontented with his employers, and attempted to signalise

his deserlion of their cause by betraying to the Royalists 
the fortifications on the mainland and on Drake's Island. 
Unluckily for the success of the plan, his own garrison turned 
upon him and sent him as a prisoner to London.' Plymouth, 
like Hull, was thus secured against treason. As seaport towns 
their capture by an enemy who had not the command of the 
sea was a matter of no slight difficulty. Exeter and Bristol 
had fallen because they were placed upon rivers and could be 
beleaguered on every side. Hull and Plymouth could not be 
so treated. Charles's northern wing, under Newcastle, and his 
southern wing, under Prince Maurice, would be detained 
around them as Wallenstein had been detained by the siege of 
Stralsund. 

Whatever might be the ultimate importance of the resistance 
of these towns, the attention of men was for the present fixed 

Sept. 7. on the valley of the Severn. On September 7, the

by which Essex had arrived from London, and by which he 

Sept. II. might be expected to return. On the i ith he learned 
rfthf "wo"^ that Essex had quitted Gloucester and had occupied 
armies. Tewkesbury. For a few days the armies did their 
best to outmanoeuvre one another. Essex appeared to be 
aiming northwards, either with the purpose of attacking 
Worcester, or of reaching friendly Warwickshire by a march 
along the valley of the Avon. Charles, who had nothing to 
gain by assuming the offensive, attempted to block his way up 
that valley by posting himself first at Pershore and afterwards 
at Evesham. By so doing he left the road to London open 

Sept. 15. to his adversary. On the 15th Essex turned sharply 
Sse^of southwards to Cirencester, and surprised two newly 
Cirencester, levied regiments which were intended to raise the 
Royalist standard in Kent, together with a large quantity of 
Retreat ot provisions, of which his men were sadly in need.

London, which lies out of striking distance from Oxford on the 
south, as the road by Warwick lies out of striking distance on

Either through Rupert's error or his own, Charles had al- 
lowed the enemy to slip away, and there was nothing for him 
to do but to follow, bending his course to the left of the line 
taken by Essex in order to cut him off on the foad to London,'

I have not been able to discover where this diary at present is, but War- 
burton's view that Rupert did not follow Essex, after he heard of the 
enemy's movement, because he was without orders to do so, is difficult to

a certain position, though its commander knew that the enemy was on the 
march ? 

2 In all that I have to say about this battle I have had the advantage, 
not merely of studying Mr. Money's Two Battles of Newbury, a work 
written with great local knowledge, but also of a visit to the site of the 
battle in 1883, undertaken under Mr. Money's guidance, and of a very 
lengthy correspondence on controverted points subsequently. The battle 
presents difficulties which, even after the most complete study, both of the 
locality and the authorities, are incapable of a positive solution. More 
than is usually the case, the authorities are disconnected with one another, 
and the modern writer has to put together, as best he may, narratives 
which are absolutely isolated, usually without any clear reference to the

borne Heath on the western end being succeeded farther to the 
east by Newbury Wash, as that part of the common was styled. 
The western end of the central height was cut up by copses and 
deep lanes intersecting one another, whilst the greater part of the 
northern slope was covered by inclosures. In the evening of 
the 19th some of Essex's troops made their way up to the point 
where one of the lanes, leading from Skinner's Green, opens out 
upon Newbury Wash, but they found that the Royalists had 
already planted their ordnance at this important point, and had 
sent up a small force of horse and dragoons sufficient to guard 
the post at that late hour. They consequently drew back^ 
leaving ihe work of breaking through till the next day.' 

Essex knew that the morning light would bring with it no 
easy task. His main plan of action was plainly die- 
Essex's ' tated to him by the lie of the ground. As he could 
'' ™' not pass through Newbury, he must make his way 

amongst the hedges and lanes, avoiding the open ground of 

locality or time. It will be seen that on some points, especially in reject- 
ing the victorious charge which he supposes to have been delivered by 
Essex at the end of the day, I differ from Mr. Money. On the other 
hand, the points on which I have given way before his local knowledge 
are very many. 

' The Royalists declared that they did not occupy the ground till the 
next day, but the simple narrative preserved in Yonge's Diary {Add. MSS. 
18,778, fol. 54) leaves no doubt of the fact. Compare A letter from our 
quarters at Reading, September 23. E. 69, 2. The main authorities for 
the battle, besides two narratives preserved by Yonge, and afterwards 
embodied to some extent in the newspapers, are, on the Parliamentary

account, and Sergeant Foster's A true relation of the marchings of the two

Enborne Heath to his right, till he reached the point at the 
entrance to Newbury Wash where his reconnoitring party had 
recoiled before the King's guns on the preceding evening. To 
do this, strong as he was in infantry, was comparatively easy, 
and it was also comparatively easy to push on from hedge to 
hedge on the slope of the hill to his left. Success here, how- 
ever, would not open the road to London. The road lay over 
the open ground of Newbury Wash, and of Greenham Heath 
beyond. Even if the King's guns could be taken or silenced, 
how was the Parliamentary army to make its way onward in face 
of the rush of Rupert's horse, both in numbers and in quality 
so superior to their own ? This was the real problem to be faced, 
and faced at once. No delay, no skilful manoeuvres to gain 
more favourable ground, were any longer possible. Food was 
running short with Essex, and unless he could defeat Charles 
famine would drive him to surrender. 

As plainly as the offensive was dictated to Essex, the defen- 
sive was dictated to Charles. To bar the way was the one thing 
The King's necdful, and anything which might weaken his force 
plan. fQ^ jjjj^j object would expose him to unnecessary risk. 

In this spirit were his orders given. On the morning of the 
2oth part of his army occupied the road from Kintbury along 
the Kennet valley, whilst the other part, with Rupert and the 
larger part of the cavalry, established itself across the road over 
Newbury Wash. To seek out Essex as he struggled through 
the lanes would be in the highest degree dangerous. 

It was not by the Kintbury road that Charles's right was ex- 
posed to danger. Its commanders had forgotten that to keep 
on the defensive requires skill and forethought, and 
they had neglected to secure those slopes cut up by 
hedges, which if once in the possession of the Parliamentary foot 
would command their own position in the valley. Early in the 
morning, Essex, whilst his main body was still struggling amongst 
the lanes, had despatched a party to seize the hedges on his 
left. The surprised Royalists saw the hill above them crowned 
with the advancing enemy. Sir Nicholas Byron, at the head of 
a brigade of infantry, to which a body of horse, under the com- 
mand of his nephew. Sir John Eyron, was attached, hurried up

from bank to bank, from hedge to hedge. Amongst the hun

Falkland. ^g ^^^ ^^.j^q j^^^j Icisure to think of the seemliness of 
his own attire, because he alone of all in those hosts had set his 
mind on something else than the winning of victory, he be- 
moaned the misery of his country. He was weary of the times, 
he said, but he would ' be out of it ere night.' ' Placing him- 
self as a volunteer under Sir John Byron, he noticed that his 
commander drew rein before a gap in the hedge, through which 
the bullets were flying thick and fast. Byron, whose object was 
to beat the enemy, waited till the gap had been widened. Falk- 
land, whose object was to die, spurred his horse at the opening. 
Horse and man rolled lifeless on the ground before the other 
side was reached. The battle raged on, the Royalists, for a 
time at least, steadily gaining ground.^ 

On the Royalist left, where Rupert and his cavalry were 
stationed, impatience had almost proved as ruinous as neglect. 

Whilst Essex himself, with the main part of his army, 
liamentary was pushing up the lanes leading to the entrance to 
ascends the Wash, Rupert was unable to endure the mere 
' ° ' ' patient waiting which would have enabled him, when 
the right moment came, to throw himself on the enemy's columns 
at their exit from the lanes before they had time to deploy 
on the open ground. The uninclosed land to his left, lead- 
ing to the wider expanse of Enborne Heath, tempted him on. 

' Whitelocke, 73. 

2 " The enemy had beat our foot out of the dose, and was drawn up 
near the hedge. I went to view ; and as I was giving order for making 
the gap wider my horse was shot in the throat, so that I was forced to 
call for another horse. In the meantime my Lord of Falkland, more 
gallantly than advisedly, spurred his hoise through the gap, where both he 
and his horse were immediately killed , " Byron's narrative.

Bidding a force of infantry to follow, he galloped off at the head 
of a numerous and imposing body of horse. When Enborne 
Heath was gained he could descry Essex's reserves strongly 
posted amidst inclosures, and beyond them, on the north of the 
position, the baggage waggons and artillery near Hamstead. 
It was indeed hopeless to attack a force so strongly guarded.

the trial nobly. Closing up their ranks as the ripping cannon- 

' After a long discussion, Mr. Money has convinced me that the ' little 
heath ' mentioned in Digby's narrative was Enborne Heath. Crockham 
Heath is too low and too easily commanded to have been the scene of this 
Ijart of the fight. Digby's statement that the Parliamentary horse was 
routed on this ' little heath ' is confirmed by a Parliamentary newspaper. 
" Our regiment," it is there said, " made the right wing of the army, and 
we were flanked with horse, who, being charged by the enemy, wheeled 
off and left us." Certain Infoj-mations {^. 69, 17). This combat early 
in the day is evidently the same as that described by Sergeant Foster of 
the London trained bands (E. 69, 15). He says that his regiment ran up

at the beginning of the fighting. " Our two regiments of the trained 
bands," he adds, "were placed in open campania," i.e. on open ground, 
"upon the right wing of the whole army." The incident about a Royalist 
regiment calling out ' Friends ! friends ! ' is mentioned by Sergeant Foster 
and the Cert. Inf., thus showing that they are speaking of the same com- 
bat, so that the absence of any allusion to the defeat of the horse by 
Foster cannot be regarded as fatal to the identification between the fight 
described by him and that described by Digby. Later details, it is true, 
do not entirely agree, as the fight seems to have gone on longer than 
Digby admits, and the Royalist foot, according to Foster, did take part in 
the fight, which Digby denies. Perhaps Digby was not himself present 
in this part of the battle, which would account for considerable discre- 
pancy.

shot toi e them asunder, the London apprentices and tradesmen 
stood like a wall whilst the fierce horsemen dashed up against 
their pikes in vain. Many a saddle was emptied by the 
musketeers within the square. At last an attempt was made 
to gain by fraud what force could not accomplish. Each 
regiment in both armies was clad in the colour which the fancy 
of its colonel dictated. There were men in blue, in green, in 
red on either side. To distinguish those who fought under 
Essex, each soldier in his ranks had placed in his hat a green 
spray plucked from the hedges. A regiment of Royalist cavalry 
now rode up, with similar sprays in their hats, crying out 
' Friends ! friends ! ' as they approached. The Londoners 
were too shrewd to be beguiled by the counterfeit, and a sharp 
fire of musketry drove off the tricksters. For some time the 
fight went on, the Royalist infantry, which at first had cowered 
for shelter under cover of a hill, being brought up to the charge, 
and ultimately the Londoners retreated in good order off the 
heath, and took up a position on the cultivated ground, from 
which no serious attempt was made tp dislodge them.' 

Already, whilst Essex's right was thus engaged, his centre 
had pushed up the hill. For hours there was a deadly struggle 
Fight in amongst the lanes and hedges. Each field was a 
the centre, fortress, to be captured or defended. At last two 
regiments of Parliamentary horse — perhaps because the enemy's 
cavalry was weakened by the absence of so many regiments on 
Enborne Heath — pushed out, under Stapleton, from the end 
of a lane upon the open ground of the Wash, and drove back 
a Royalist regiment by which they were assailed. They were 
too few in number to hold the ground, and they drew back 
waiting for reinforcements. As other regiments came up there 
were fresh charges, and a determined resistance. At last 
Stapleton's regiment was broken and driven back into the lane. 
Already the Royalist horse was following up its victory and 

' Here again both Digby and Foster substantially agree. " We were 
glad," says the latter, "to retreat a little way into the field." Digby 
speaks of the result as ' the forcing the foot to retreat into their strength, 
though unbroken,' The field, however, is, as distinguished from 'closes,' 
open ground,

pouring after the fugitives, regardless of the Parliamentary 
musketeers who lined the hedges on either side. Caught in 
a trap like the French chivalry at Poitiers, the dashing Cavaliers 
perished almost to a man, shot down without hope of defence 
in the deep trench between the banks. The battle was restored, 
and the approaches to the Wash were once more the scene of 
embittered strife. 

The Royalist commanders had failed to do more than keep 
Essex's centre in check. Their attack on his right on Enborne 
Royalist Heath had profited them little. In the afternoon, 
th?pl°i?a. massing large forces on their own right, they directed 
mentary left. ^ fresh attack on his left in the valley of the Kennet. 
The eye of the veteran Skippon, who acted that day as 
second in command of the Parliamentary army, caught sight 
of them as he was encouraging his men upon the hill. Hurry- 
ing down, he drove back the enemy, and returned with the 
assurance that the army would not now be assailed in the rear 
nor its baggage pillaged. Again the battle raged along the 
whole line from the Kennet to the En Brook. An attempt by 
Essex gains the troops left behind by Skippon in the valley to 
ground. seize a ford over the Kennet failed ; but, on the 
whole, the Parliamentary army gained ground. When night 
fell it had not only occupied a great part of the inclosures which 
had been hotly disputed earlier in the day, but had even esta- 
blished itself on the edge of Newbury A\^ash. 

For all that, nothing decisive had been achieved. The 
King's troops still stretched across hill and valley, barring the

it was in full conviction that if surrender or starvation was to 
be averted another battle, as vigorously contested as that which 
had just died away, must be fought on the morrow. The 
sentinels heard, or thought they heard, the rolling sound of 

fresh guns brought up to be placed in position. When 
The King' moming dawned all uncertainty was at end. The 

Royalist positions were empty; Charles had with- 
drawn his troops into Newbury under cover of the night. 
The way to London was open at last. 



1043 THE LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES. 217 

The King's ammunition had failed him," and it seemed to 
him that he had no choice but to retreat. It may be that, 
weak as was the fire of the cannons and muskets of those days, 
a resolute body of horse, with pikemen in support, might have 
kept back Essex's hungry soldiers till food absolutely failed ; 
but neither Charles nor his followers were in any mood for such 
an adventure. The unlooked-for prowess of the Londoners 
and the terrible slaughter of their own leaders had been so 
discouraging that there was little thought of renewing the con- 
flict on unequal terms. 

Each side claimed the victory, but if up to the moment of 
Charles's retreat the Parliamentarians had failed to gain their 
... object, at least they had shown themselves the better 

victory. soldiers. To the great Royalist historian of the war 
Clarendon's there Seemed to be something contrary to the order of 
compamt. j^a^j-u^e in their achievement. On the King's side 
unequal fate cut down 'persons of honour and public name,' 
whilst amongst his adversaries it was only known that ' some 
obscure, unheard-of colonel or officer was missing,' or that 
'some citizen's wife bewailed the loss of her husband.' It is 
indeed unnecessary for those who respect humanity above any 
single class to hold that the lives of all men are of equal value 
to their fellows. The loss of the leader is greater than that of 
the led, and the fall of the worthy general or statesman is 
more deeply felt than that of hundreds of the toilers but for 
whose hearty co-operation neither general nor statesman would 
have saved himself from failure. The charge against the 
Royalist gentry is that they had ceased to lead. The contrast 
between the infantry which followed Essex and the infantry 
which followed Charles is their bitterest condemnation. They 
could fling themselves upon death with romantic heroism, but 
they had lost touch of the middle and lower classes. They 
could not inspire the common man with their own courage, 

' Byron was incredulous, but under the date of September 23 the 
Perfect Diurnal, a Parliamentary newspaper, says that some officers from 
the army told the Houses that ' before half the fight was over their'— i.e. 
the Royalists' — ' powder and shot was so far spent that they were not able 
to answer us one shot for three.'

because they had no hving faith in which he was able to share. 
They could point sarcasms at the na-rrowness and harshness of 
popular Puritanism, but a nation cannot live upon sarcasms, 
and the culture which raised the higher minds amongst them 
above any possibility of accepting Puritanism as a standard of 
life was entirely inaccessible to the rank and file of their 
followers. 

On the battle-field of Newbury death had dealt hardly with 

the noblest of the King's supporters. A monument, which has 

recently been erected not far from the actual scene 

The 

Falkland of the battle, gracefully couples with that of Falkland 
monument. ^^ names of Carnarvon and Sunderland, who fell in 
the struggle either on the Wash or on Enborne Heath. Un- 
happily, modern political partisanship, stretching across the 
ages, has attempted to awaken the now silent feuds of the past, 
and has refused to commemorate the deaths of any except 
those who fought on the royal side on that memorable day. 
Such an exclusion is especially unjust to Falkland. By assign- 
ing to him a memorial which would be suitable to a Rupert, it 
deprives him of his special claim to the loving memory ot 
future generations. His glory was that when other eyes 
persisted in seeing nothing but party divisions, he had persisted 
in seeing England as a whole, and that he had thus ceased to 
be in accord either with the party which he had joined or with 
the party which he had deserted. It was because he could 
sympathise with neither that he flung away his life by an act 
which can hardly be distinguished from suicide. He could 
not, like Wolfe, die happily because the enemy had taken to 
flight. All that he asked of the enemy was to lodge a bullet in 
his body. He had ceased to hate, though he had not yet learnt 
to love. History, which takes note of the aspiration as well as 
of the accomplishment, cannot but think of Falkland as of one 
whose heart was large enough to embrace all that was noble on 
either side. It sees in him a prophet whose vision of peace 
was too pure and too harmonious to allay the discords of his 
own day, and whose longings could only be satisfied by the 
reconciliation which was to he accomplished long after he had 
ceased to breathe. 



1643 ESSEX ON THE MARCH. 219 

Little recked Essex of dreams or visions. Finding the way 
open before him, he pushed on steadily. A sudden attack by 

Rupert in a deep lane near Aldermaston threw his

maston. beaten off, and on the 22nd Essex, without further 
Essex'" "'^ difficulty, entered Reading. The King, after throw- 
ReadS '"S ^ garrison into Donnington Castle, retired to 

Oxford. After the fight at Newbury it was at least 
plain that Charles needed more force than he had at his 
disposal to overpower the resistance of London, whilst it was 
equally plain that the Parliamentary armies were not as yet 
adequate to the task of crushing Charles. Much, therefore, 
depended on the result of the struggles round Hull and 
Plymouth ; much, too, depended on the result of the negotia- 
tions which, during these weeks of balanced warfare, Charles 
was carrying on in Ireland, and the Houses were carrying on 
in Scotland.

THE IRISH CESSATION AND THE SOLEMN LEAGUE AND

AfD had not come to Charles from Ireland as speedily as he 
had once thought possible. Loyal as the confederate Catholics

PtoctS' neglect the interests of their country and of theii 
ofthenego- religion merely to give Charles the opportunity of

of the members would be Catholics. On Tune i,

however, Ormond informed them that they must be 
content to rely ' on what they may gain from the King upon 
humble and reasonable propositions to be made by their 
agents, which may be fit for his Majesty to grant.' In the 
meanwhile, to afford an opportunity for a peaceful negotiation 
at Oxford, there must be a cessation of hostilities, and they 
must themselves contribute a sufficient sum to enable the 
King's army in Ireland to subsist without plundering. At 
the same time Ormond pointed to the rock on which the 
/legotiation was likely to be wrecked. To allow a free parlia- 
ment to meet would be, 'in the construction of some, in effect, 
to make them judges of their own actions, and to entrust them 
to make laws for them who have had little cause to trust to the 
provision they shall make for their future security, for few but 
themselves are like to be of that parliament, as the times are 
now composed, and how unequal that course would be they

end. An attempt to draw money or supplies from 
the impoverished citizens of Dublin ended in complete 
failure, and on the 24th Ormond set out, with at least the tacit 
consent of the Government in Dublin, to attempt to come to 
terms with the enemy. He found the Supreriie Council less

Views of the '" ° 

Supreme would restore to the clergy of their Church the 
jurisdiction which they had formerly exercised, would 
hand over to themselves under parliamentary forms the actual 
government of Ireland, and would secure the co-operation of 
the royal troops against the common enemy, the Puritan Scots 
in Antrim.' 

Such views, attractive as they were, suffered from one fatal 
defect. They presupposed that Charles, if he gained the 
victory over his enemies in England, would have either the 
will or the power to support in Ireland the system which now 
found favour at Kilkenny. 

Very different opinions prevailed amongst a numerous 
section of the Irish clergy, and amongst the northern popula- 
Naiionaiist tions, whosc military chief was the energetic and 
opinions. experienced soldier, Owen O'Neill. These men 
rallied round Scarampi, who had recently arrived as a Papal 
delegate to give all possible encouragement to the insurgents, 
and to provide for the full recognition of the claims of his 
Church. In an argument drawn up by some persons who were 
possessed of his confidence,^ the notion of trusting to Charles 
is denounced with plain-spoken severity. "We should un- 
doubtedly," they urged, " carry on our work to establish the 
Catholic faith, the authority of Parliament, and the security of 
our country, by arms and intrepidity, not by cessations and 
indolence. For this there are the following reasons : That 
peace will ever be made between the King and the Parliament 
is improbable, nor would it be to our advantage, for if they 
combined we should be necessitated to surrender. It is likely, 
however, that before long one side will become powerful 
enough to dictate to the other. If the Parliament prevail, 
which God forbid, all Ireland will fall under their arbitrary

power ; the swords of the Puritans will be at our throats, and 
we shall lose everything except our faith. Should the King 
triumph, we may expect much from his goodness and kindness, 
and much from the Queen's intercession. It is uncertain, 
however, what laws or terms may be imposed on us under 
such circumstances. The King, should he succeed by the aid 
of the Protestants, would be, in a manner, engaged to them. 
They, as usual, would oppose freedom of religion in Ireland, 
and insist on the punishment of our ' rebellion,' as they style 
it, to enable them to seize our properties and occupy our 
estates. It would probably be thought a sufificient concession 
to the Queen to allow us to return to the miserable position in 
which we were before the war. On the other hand, if we now 
adopt proper measures, the party eventually triumphing in 
England will find us in arms, well provided, with increased 
territories, and stronger in foreign succours. Thus they would 
not so readily invade us or swallow us up, so as to leave us 
without the free exercise of our faith or some share in the 
administration of the kingdom. By God's assistance our arms 
may perhaps carry matters so far that we may obtain or insist 
on many other advantages." 

It was the banner of Irish nationality which was here un- 
folded, and those who upheld it were at least not afraid to look 
Irish na- i" the face the stern fact that no English party would 
tionaiity. willingly tolerate the organisation of the Roman 
Catholic Church in Ireland or the organisation of a purely 
Irish government. If the opportunity of England's divisions was 
to be seized to any profit, Ireland must become a nation strong 
enough to hold its own. To gain for itself the sentiment of 
patriotism, to cherish, in defiance of all assailants, its own tradi- 
tions and its own beliefs, would be worth many a struggle and 
many a defeat, if only through suffering it might be attained. 

Such a prize is not easy of achievement, and it was not 
within reach of Irishmen in the seventeenth century. They

Catholic, or which were not Catholic at all. What was still more 
fatal, they over-estimated their own power of cohesion, and they 
failed to understand that England's resistance was, at least to 
some extent, based on a righteous foundation. No race, no 
nation, can live entirely for itself. The achievement of nation- 
ality is but the stepping-stone to a still wider development of 
the social feelings of humanity, and by throwing themselves 
ath'.vart that stream of European progress, of which the im- 
pelling force was Protestantism, Irishmen had taken up a 
position of hostility to the development of other countries than 
their own. Above all, the independence of a Papal Ireland 
would have been a standing menace to Protestant England. 
Nothing like this had been the case when Scotland shook 
itself free in the fourteenth century. There was political and 
military danger to England, but there was no danger to its 
intellectual and spiritual life. Add to this that Englishmen, 
little mindful of their own cruelties exercised upon Irishmen, 
were filled with the bitterest indignation by the Ulster murders ; 
and that, even if the Ulster murders had never taken place, 
they could hardly be expected to welcome a settlement which 
would have left their own kindred beyond the Irish Channel 
exposed to ruin. It is, therefore, no matter for surprise that 
all English parties combined to treat the Irish claims, even in 
their most moderate form, as absolutely inadmissible. " Out 
of Ireland," wrote a pamphleteer, when the news of Ormond's 
resolution to take the field arrived in London, " it is informed 
that, notwithstanding all the means which hath been practised 
either privately or publicly by the Papists there to make a 
pacification and cessation of arms between the Protestants and 
Irish rebels, yet the Protestants will not be brought to con- 
descend thereunto, because they know it will tend, not only to 
the utter ruin of themselves, but of all the Protestants in 
England and Scotland also." ' 

Necessity, however, was for the time too strong even for 
such considerations. The negotiations were resumed after 
Ormond's military failure, and on September 15 articles of

its benefits ; if not, Ormond with his army was to stand aside 
whilst the whole power of the Confederation was brought

Ormond to assist the Irish in overpowering them.' Upon 
these conditions the Supreme Council agreed to pay 800/. to 
relieve the garrison of Naas, and 30,000/. in money or cattle to

to discuss the political questions at issue with Charles in person, 
and it was fondly hoped that this discussion would lay the 
foundations of a permanent peace.

no shadow of doubt either as to their intention to invade

into power needs, in proportion to its previous ignorance, a 
strictness of discipline which becomes unnecessary as soon as 
it has learned to bear lightly the responsibilities of its new 
position. That discipline in England was afforded to the 
middle classes by the rule, grasping, unscrupulous, and im- 
moral as it was, of Henry VHI. In Scotland it was by the 
Presbyterian clergy that the middle classes were organised, and 
the organisation thus given enabled them to throw off the 
yoke of the feudal nolples and ultimately to assert their own 
predominance. 

It was with little thought of the political result of their rule 
that the clergy strove to maintain themselves in the position 
to which they had been elevated. To them the support of 
religion was all in all, and, strict as they were in the matter of 
doctrinal orthodoxy, their strictness was still greater with respect 
to the observance of the Ten Commandments. They strove 
by means of church disciphne, enforced in ihe most inquisitorial 
manner, to bring a whole population under the yoke of the 
moral law. To a later generation, which disbelieves in the 
existence of witches, and which has ceased, at least according

to the Genevan interpretation of the command, to keep holy 
the Sabbath-day, there is something very shocking in hearing 
that severe penalties were inflicted upon those who infringed 
in the slightest and most innocent manner the rule which 
guarded the sanctity of the Lord's Day, and still more that in 
the course of a few months no less than thirty unhappy women 
were burnt alive as witches in Fife alone.' These things have 
passed away, as for a great part of European mankind the 
monastic rule of the Middle Ages has passed away. Discipline 
for discipline, the Scottish system was the nobler of the two. 
It was not a rule for those alone who sought counsels of per- 
fection, whilst the mass of mankind was left to content them- 
selves with a lower standard of morality. In Scotland there 
was to be a parity of moral law as there was to be a parity of 
ministerial office. The fierce ruffians who in the sixteenth 
century had reddened the country with the feuds of noble 
houses, the rude peasants who wallowed in impurity, were 
made to feel the compulsion of a never-resting, ever-abiding 
power, which pried into their lives and called them to account 
for their deeds as no lay government, however arbitrary, could 
venture to do. Therefore the Scottish people has rightly 
venerated as its saviours those to whom it is mainly owing that, 
even in that race after material wealth which set in amongst a 
people whose soil was poor and whose climate was ungenial, it 
has ever kept m honour the laws of righteousness. 

The Scottish clergy were likely to be the last to perceive 
that what was possible in Scotland was impossible in England, 
or that a nation whose middle classes had been dis- 
sy&gt;temfm-^ cipliucd Under the Tudor monarchy, and had already

The Scot- would never place itself under the Presbyterian

clergy urged the assimilation of the English to the Scottish 

Church. They had pressed it on Charles in their negotiation

in the spring, and they were certain to press it on the Parlia- 
mentary diplomatists in the summer. 

The error, fatal as it was, as long as it was persisted in, to a 
permanent good understanding between the two nations, was 
Nature hardly likely to appear in its true colours to a clerical 
of their body. It would never occur to them that the politi- 
cal development of the English people would render 
them hostile to a strict inquisition into the moralities of domes- 
tic life, and that their superior social organisation would make 
them intolerant of a masterful ecclesiastical rule. They were 
the less likely to pay attention to the essential difference in the 
character of the two peoples, because the Parliament at West- 
minster which now implored their aid was quite ready to accept 
Presbyterianism in its more showy, but in reality less important, 
aspect. Little difficulty would be made about the abolition of 
Episcopacy, or about the establishment of a Presbyterian minis- 
try. No one, however, who had studied the Root-and-branch 
Bill, which was brought in and dropped in the summer of 1641,' 
could doubt that the English Parliament would refuse to sur- 
render that control over the clergy by the laity which had been 
the most abiding result of the Tudor rule, or would resist to the 
uttermost the ever-present despotism of the Presbyterian church 
courts. Yet, as every Scottish minister knew, it was in these 
two points, and not in the mere absence of bishops, that the 
essence of Scottish Presbyterianism was to be found. 

On August 7 the English Commissioners arrived at Leith. 
Of the two named by the House of Lords, Grey had refused to

Marshaii listed by two ministers — Stephen Marshall, who was 
and Nye. the mouthpiecc of the Presbyterian party, which was 
predominant amongst the Parhamentary clergy, and his son-in- 
law, Philip Nye, who had been the minister of a congregation 
at Arnheim, where, in common with the leaders of some other 
congregation- in the Netherlands, he had developed opinions 

' See Hist, of England, 1603-1642, ix. 407. 



!643 ENGLISH DIPLOMACY. 429 

on the subject of church government which, without being dis- 
tinctly in accordance with those of the Separatists, accorded far 
greater liberty of action to individual congregations than the 
Presbyterians were willing to allow. The popular language, 
always disinclined to admit of fine distinctions, classed Nye and 
his friends with the Separatists under the common name of 
Independents, an appellation which had been for many years 
growing into use amongst the Separatists themselves. 

The Scottish clergy, to whom Nye's presence was unwel- 
come, were well pleased to hear that the preparation of the State 
Au^st 8. P'ipers, which were to be presented in the name of the 
the^negft^- Commissioners, had been entrusted to Marshall in 
tions conjunction with Vane. Nevertheless, the negotia- 

tion at first took an unsatisfactory turn. The Scots soon pointed 
out that the English demand for aid was unaccompanied by any 
suggestion of uniformity in religion. For a moment it seemed 
as if the idea of sending military aid would be abandoned. At 
a meeting, at which the chief Scottish laity and clergy were pre- 
sent, there was for some time a general concurrence of opinion 
that the Scottish army should cross the Tweed to offer its medi- 
ation to both parties, and not to give direct assistance to the 
English Parliament. A few words from Johnston of Warriston, 
however, sufficed to convince the authors of this scheme of the 
futility of the course proposed. Yet, though the Scots were now 
inclined to give way, further discussion with the English Com- 
missioners only served to bring into prominence the essential 
difference between the two nations. "The English," wrote 
Baillie, " were for a civil league, we for a religious covenant." 
The English, in short, did not seem to understand that they 
had come as suppliants. They fancied that, distracted as they 
were by civil war, they could take the destinies of their national 
Church into their own hands as firmly as their fathers had done 
when they were united under Henry or Elizabeth.

servation of themselves and their religion.' A vow was to 
be adopted in common by both ' that we shall all and each 
one of us sincerely, really, and constantly, through the grace of 
God, endeavour in our several callings and places the pre-

nations to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion,

worship and catechising, that we and our posterity after us 
may, as brethren, live in faith and love.' ^ To this draft the 
Enghsh Commissioners took exception. " They," wrote Baillie, 
" were, more than we could assent to, for keeping of a door open 
y , in England to Independency." ^ A.11 that Vane could 

amend- hope for, unless his mission was to fail entirely, was 
to keep a door open for the assumption by the Eng- 
lish Parliament of a control over the national religion. His 
subtle mind suggested a means by which this end might be 
effected. He suggested two amendments, by which the contested 
clause should pledge the nations to preserve ' the Church of 
Scotland in doctrine, worship, discipline, and government ac- 
cording to the Word of God, and the reformation of religion in 
the Church of England according to the same Holy Word and 
the example of the best reformed Churches,' whilst the remain- 
ing words were left as Henderson had penned them.^ Hen-

derson could hardly object to the proposed change, and he may 
reasonably have argued that the general sense of the passage 
would stand in the way of any serious deflection from the Scot- 
tish model. 

Other clauses provided for the abolition of Episcopacy in 
F.ngland, the maintenance of the rights of the two Parliaments 
and of the stipulations of the treaty of 1641, and the bringing 
to trial of incendiaries and malignants. The Solemn League 
and Covenant, as the amended document was styled, was at 
August 17. once adopted by the Assembly, and on August 1 7 it 
jLe'agueInd WHS ratified by the Convention of Estates.' The 
adopreTby Convention at once proceeded to order the levy of 
tent?o°n"of ^ general taxation, and informed the Commissioners 
Estates. that they expected a monthly payment of 30,000/. 
from the English Parliament, 100,000/. to be paid in advance 

open for Independency, and the first ' according to the Word of God ' has 
the aspect of a phrase fitted in on second thoughts. That phrase is one 
which would be familiar to Vane. It occurs in clause 185 of the Grand 
Remonstrance. " We hold it requisite," the House of Commons there 
declare, "that there should be throughout the whole realm a conformity 
to that order which the laws enjoin according to the Word of God." 
More recently, on June 12, 1643, the ordinance for calling the Assembly 
of Divines had declared the intention of the Houses to be ' that such a 
government shall be settled in the Church as may be most agreeable to 
God's Holy Word, and most apt to procure and preserve the peace of the 
Church at home, and nearer agreement with the Church of Scotland and 
other reformed Churches abroad.' Guthry, in his Memoiis (V]oi), W], 
says that the Commissioners on their arrival ' presented to the Assembly a 
letter from the divines assembled at Westminster, together with a declara- 
tion from the Parliament of England, both to one sense, viz. that they 
purposed to extirpate Episcopacy root and branch, and to introduce that 
which they should find most agreeable to the Word of God.' Guthry 
alleges that he objected to this as insufficient. Guthry, however, is inac- 
curate here. The declaration of the Lords and Commons (,L.J. vi. 140) 
has nothing in it about the Word of God. Neither has the supplication of 
the divines (Spalding, ii. 260). Guthry may, however, have confused 
language spoken by the Commissioners with that of the letters which they 
brought. On the whole, therefore, I think I am justified in conjecturing 
that Henderson's draft is represented by the form in the Acts of Parliament, 
with the omission of the two phrases.

That body, which, having met on July i, had now been in 
session in the Chapel of Henry VII. for nearly two months, 

was a very different body from the General Assembly 
Assembly which exerciscd supreme authority over the Scottish 

Church. Composed of 120 clerical and 30 lay 
members,^ the latter having been selected from the two Houses, 
it was the creature of Parliament, and was only authorised to 
give advice upon subjects on which Parliament desired its 
opinion. It comprised the flower of the Puritan clergy, whilst 
the few Episcopalian members who had been originally nomi- 
nated either refused to take part in its deliberations or were 
expelled upon charges of royalism. Of the lay members only 
a few gave themselves the trouble to attend. At first it had 
been entrusted with the task of revising the Thirty-nine 
Articles, but its attention was now to be directed to a subject 
of far more pressing importance.

Presbyterianism in its unwillingness to submit to the regula-

Amend- appointed by the State without regard to the pre-

to ask any man to engage to maintain the Church of Scotland,

defined the Prelacy which it would engage to exter- 
minate as that which consisted in archbishops and bishops. 
The Assembly evidently intended to reserve to itself perfect 
freedom as to the form of church government which was to 
take the place of the old Episcopacy.' 

In adopting the first amendment of the Assembly the 

Commons, perhaps to avoid giving offence to the Scots, trans- 

Sept. I. f^Ted it from the text to the margin. One change 

S'fhr™"" of their own was carried without difficulty. Ireland 

House of was to be brought into covenant with England and 

Scotland, and, as far as words could effect anything, 
that land of Catholics was to be brought under the yoke of 
Puritanism.2 On the amendment relating to the definition 

of Prelacy there was more hesitation. Glyn and 

Maynard, who as members of the Peace-party dis- 
liked the additional barrier which would be raised between the 
Houses and the King, did their best to induce the Commons 
to leave open a door for the settlement of the Church on the 
Pynj's basis of modified Episcopacy. Pym, in reply, asked 

argument, whether, admitting such a system to be useful as 
medicine for the disease of the Church, a sick man who saw a 
murderer approaching would 'cast away his medicine and 
betake himself to his sword, or take his medicine and suffer 
himself to be killed ? ' Surely he would rather ' prevent and 
remedy the present danger.' ' To Pym the exact form of 
church government was a matter of indifference ; but at the 
time when he was speaking he knew that Gloucester was still 
unrelieved, and he thought that it was not worth while to throw 
away the hope of Scottish assistance for the sake of the most 
admirable of church governments. If the King was able to 
overcome the resistance of London, he would make short 
work of modified Episcopacy. The Commons rallied to Pym's 
view, and accepted the proposal of the Assembly.

Word of God,' was retained in relation to the coming reform 

of the English Church, and the Assembly's explanation of the 

Prelacy to be abolished was re- transferred from the margin to 

the text. Thus altered, the Covenant was accepted by the 

Lords, and it was arranged that on September 25 it should be 

sworn to at St. Margaret's by the House of Commons and the 

Assembly of Divines. 

Of the two members of the Assembly who had taken part 

in the negotiations at Edinburgh, Marshall had for the present 

remained in Scotland : Nye was, therefore, pointed

Nye's out as the proper person to open the proceedmgs 

at St. Margaret's. Nevertheless, it was significant 
of the temper which prevailed at Westminster, that one whose 
principles were so little in accordance with those which pre- 
vailed in Scotland should not have been passed over. It was

well known that the sermons which he had been called on to 
deliver at Edinburgh had given little satisfaction to a critical 
audience of convinced Presbyterians. He now seized the 
opportunity of reminding his English hearers that the Covenant 
did not bind them to a servile imitation of their Northern 
brethren. "If England," he said, "have attained to any 
greater perfection in so handling the Word of righteousness 
and truths that are according to godliness, so as to make men 
more godly, more righteous ; and if in the Churches of Scot- 
land any more light and beauty in matters of order and dis- 
cipline by which their assemblies are more orderly ; or if to 
any other Church or person it hath been given better to have 
learned Christ in any of His ways than any of us, we shall 
humbly bow and kiss their lips that can speak right words unto 
us in this matter, and help us unto the nearest uniformity with the 
Word and mind of Christ in this great work of Reformation." ' 
In this spirit the members of the Assembly swore to main- 
tain the Covenant. In this spirit 112 '^ members of the House 
_ _^ of Commons, who were present on that day, gave in 
nant taken their adhcsion. Henderson, who spoke later, took 
House of no exception to Nye's words. Substantially, he 
aiTth™^ doubtless thought, agreement had been secured. 
Assembly, yet, whatever the future might have in store, it was 
something that the ideal of Nye, which was no other than the 
ideal of Robinson, should have been upheld in such a place 
and on such an occasion. At least between 
of the Puritan men the Covenant, as finally accepted, was 

no narrowing formula tightening the bonds of ortho- 
doxy. Unhappily it had another side. It emphasised the 
separation between those who were Puritans and those who 
were not. Pym, whether or not he had understood the fuh 
import of his words, had spoken truly. The Covenant was 
not medicine to heal the wounds of the Church, but a sword 
to divide. After all that had passed and was passing still, how

could it well be otherwise ? Yet, divisive as the Covenant was, 
it merely emphasised the division which was harsh enough 
already. Especially had Charles's understanding with the Irish 
j,|j.^^j deepened the lines of controversy. "Most of all," wrote 

the Irish BailHe of his own countrymen, " the Irish cessa- 
tion made the minds of our people embrace that 
means of safety." ' What was true of Scotland was also true 
of England.

joy in every household from which a son or a brother had gone 
forth, save where those mourners dwelt whose sorrow was 
none the legs real because those who had fallen bore no lordly 
names. 

If there was joy in homely dwellings, there was anxiety 
with those who were entrusted with the conduct of affairs. 
The army of Essex was again reduced to those scanty numbers 
which had made it insuilicient for all offensive operations. He 
found it necessary to fall back upon Windsor. On October 3 
the Royalists reoccupied Reading, where Sir Jacob 
Reading Astlcy was installed as governor. Charles could 
by the hardly have been in a better position if he had been

Surre'ii'der of arms were no less prosperous. On October 6 Dart- 
Dartmouth. f^outh Surrendered to Prince Maurice, whilst the 
far more important port of Plymouth was in grievous danger.' 

It was not a time when the Parliamentary generals could 
afford to remain at variance. An understanding was, in ap- 
pearance at least, patched up between Essex and 
Reconciiia- Waller, the latter agreeing to take his instructions 
Essex and from the Lord General, and being empowered to

permanently rely. He told the citizens that they must choose 
Demands between three courses. Unless they could either

would be content to serve without pay, they must make 
peace.' 

The difficulty of finding money for Essex was the greater 
because the citizens were at the same time called upon to find 
Q^j g money for the Scots. On October 6 many thousand 
Money for pounds Were subscribed to enable Parliament to 
fulfil its obligations to its Northern allies. Some- 
thing more than money was, however, needed if the inter-

22nd Cromwell was himself in Hull, bringing with him a store of 

muskets and powder.' The day on which he arrived had been 

Se t 22 appointed by the beleaguered garrison to be held 

Cromwell in as a day of fasting and humiliation, and it may well 

be imagined how devoutly Cromwell joined in the 
prayers for Divine assistance put up to Heaven amidst the 
booming of the cannon. In those anxious moments began 
his tried brotherhood in arms with the younger Fairfax. 

Cromwell did not remain long in Hull. On the 23rd 
Lord Willoughby paid an equally brief visit to the besieged 
garrison ; and on the 26th Sir Thomas crossed over to the 
Lincolnshire side with the twenty troops of horse which were 
still left in the town.'^ Shortly afterwards the three com- 
manders met at Boston. 

At Boston Cromwell had hoped to find money from the 
Association, but money there was none,^ and in the beginning 

of October he arrived at Lynn to confer with 
Cromwell Manchester. However the financial difficulty was 
at Lynn. arranged, Cromwell was able to return to Lincoln- 
shire with the knowledge that Manchester with the main body 
of infantry would soon follow.

pushed on through Horncastle to the reh'ef of the besieged 
garrison. Cromwell, if it had been possible, would have 
avoided a conflict, as his horses were worn out by a month of 
hard work ; but to retreat to Boston was to court disaster, and 
the Puritan troopers, pealing forth a battle-psalm as they rode, 
advanced towards the enemy. The two fofces were about 
eijual in numbers. They met near Winceby, a little hamlet on 
a ridge of ground which runs away past Horncastle to the 
northward. Cromwell, who led the van, dashed into a charge. 
At the first onset his horse was shot under him, and as he 
struggled to disengage himself he was thrown violently to the 
ground by the rush of a Royalist trooper. Recovering his 
footing, and flinging himself on the first horse which came to 
hand, he was soon in the thick of the fight. The enemy, 
checked in his career, fell back on his supports. Another 
charge from Fairfax turned the whole force to flight. Through 
Horncastle rushed pursuers and pursued, the Puritan sword 
rising and falling not in vain. After Horncastle was passed 
the fugitives scattered. Of those who were not slain or taken 
prisoners many were drowned in the waters of the Fens, and 
the scanty remnant at last found refuge behind the walls of 
Newark.'

part in the combat — fulfilled the promise of the retreat at 
Gainsborough. The gallant gentlemen who followed

at least, by compulsion, had no spirit in them which could

against our wills ; we were as true servants to the Parliament, 
to our religion and liberties, as any in England. . . , We die

At Hull the same causes were producing the same results. 
Newcastle was not without brave and devoted followers, but 
Newcastle the greater part of his army had been swept up from 
before Hull, jq^jj ^^^ village sorely against their wills.' New- 
castle was a gallant gentleman, but he was no soldier, and his 
military adviser, Lord Eythin, was a Scot, and as such was not 
likely to inspire the Yorkshire villagers with warlike ardour. 
The besieging army melted away before the toils and hardships 
to which they were subjected. " You often hear us called the 
Popish army," jested Newcastle, when Fairfax let the water of 
the Humber into his trenches, " but you see we trust not in 
our good works." ^ Every day the besieged grew stronger in 
courage and resolution. The women of Hull volunteered to 
carry earth to strengthen the fortifications. On October 5 a 
reinforcement of 500 men, sent by Manchester, landed on the 
quay. On the nth, -the day of Winceby fight, a general sally 
of the garrison drove the besiegers out of several of their forts, 
and captured a huge cannon, one of the pair known familiarly 
either as Gog and Magog, or as the Queen's pocket pistols. On 

the morning of the 12th Newcastle raised the siege.

Oct 20 surrendered to Manchester, and it was hardly likely 

Lincoln that the remaining Royalist garrisons in the county 

would hold-out long.' The failure of Newcastle to 
take Hull had far greater influence upon the progress of the war 
than the failure of Charles to take Gloucester. Yet, important 
from a strategical point of view as these events were, they were 
still more important as revealing a soldier-like capacity in the 
Parliamentary ranks, and a heartiness of co-operation between 
the Parliamentary leaders.

than the occupation of Reading. Not only did it cut the 
communication between London and the North, but

Dyves gave way before the approaching storm. On the 28th 
he abandoned the rising fortifications of Newport 
Pagnell. On the 30th they were occupied by a 
detachment of the army of Essex, whilst another 
detachment busied itself with throwing up defences 
at St. Albans. Whatever might happen elsewhere 
the hne of communication with the North must be 
firmlyheldif the Parliamentary cause was to be saved.' 
It was the more important that a strong garrison should 

be posted at Newport Pagnell as the Royalists had fortified 
Towcester.^ Waller, with about "rjooo men, was 

Royalist , „ , , • -i , 

garrison at posted at Famham, to guard agamst a possible 
attack from the West. 
The difficulty of raising money was even greater than that 
of levying soldiers. Two of the judges, indeed, Berkeley and 
Trevor, were opportunely fined for their part in the 
ship-money judgment, and 16,000/. was thus obtained 
for the immediate necessities of the armies.' On 
September 21 the revenues of the King, the Queen, 
and the Prince were seized, so far as seizure was 
practicable, for the use of the Parliament ; and on 
October 9 an ordinance directed that the lands and 
houses of such members of either House as had 
absented themselves, or of other persons who neglected to pay 
the Parliamentary taxation, should be let, in order that the rent 
might serve as a security for the repayment of loans.'' 

It was not enough to satisfy the soldiers of Essex and 
Waller ; the Scots must be satisfied as well. On 
October 15 the little group of the peers who re- 
mained at Westminster took the Covenant, and on 
the following day an ordinance was passed to autho- 
rise a loan of 200,000/. Of this a third part, or

army of 21,000 men was to cross the Tweed. On the 27th the

Money sent. Northumberland that the English Parliament 
engaged itself to provide. The maintenance of the Scottish 
army in Ireland was now of the gravest importance for the 
issue of the struggle in England, and it was therefore actually 
to receive those supplies from Westminster which had been 
promised long ago.* The Irish cessation, so bitterly 
denounced, had at last appeared as a grim reality. On 

October 23 an English regiment, set free by the 
Landing of cessation from service in Munster, had landed at 
fromire-^ Minchcad, and before long another regiment from 
'^"'*' the same quarter appeared at Bristol.' At first 

it was firmly believed that the two regiments were com- 
posed of Irish rebels who had been brought over to massacre 
Protestants in England, as two years before they had massacred 
them in Ulster. Even when the truth was known the indig- 
nation excited was hardly lessened. If the first to arrive were 
Englishmen, it was said, Irish Papists would follow close upon 
their heels, or, at all events, would have free scope in Ireland 
to complete their bloody work upon the Protestants there. 
No single action of Charles's did so much to weaken his 
authority as the introduction of these troops from Ireland. In 
Lincolnshire it made the conciliatory action of Manchester far 
more easy than it otherwise would have been. A large number 
of gentlemen who had hitherto appeared as supporters of the

royal cause now professed their readiness to take part against 
it.' At Oxford it gave an excuse to Holland to make his 
escape and to return to Westminster. The silent contempt of 
London was a welcome exchange for the scornful hostility of 
Oxford. 

The ill-feeling in London was much increased by the know- 
ledge that appointments recently made at Oxford portended a 
Oct. struggle in which all thought of concealment would 
atOrford? b^ flung aside. Cottington, who was almost openly 
Cottington ^ Catholic, had recently become Lord Treasurer, 
and Digby. ^^^ jj^g energetic and unscrupulous Digby had suc- 
ceeded Falkland as Secretary of State. In Digby Charles had 
a man to whom he could confide secrets of which it was well 
to keep the honourable Nicholas in profound ignorance. 

Under these circumstances, the belief, which had always 
been strong, that Charles had made himself the instrument of 
Oct. 19. a terrible Popish conspiracy was raised to absolute 
u^"each- conviction. It is at least significant that the news 
mtnt to be of the Irish cessation was followed by a resolution 
with. to hurry on the proceedings against Laud, which had 

been allowed to sleep for nearly two years. To those who can 
look back calmly at the past it may appear inexplicable that the 
Houses thought it worth while to prosecute an old man who 
seems to us to have been absolutely harmless. He at least 
could never have stepped forth, as it was once feared that 
Strafford would step forth, to lead the King's armies to victory. 
The anger which was aroused against Laud was of a different 
kind from that which had been aroused against Strafford. 
In him was seen the embodiment of that spirit which was lead- 
ing men who called themselves Protestants to seek the 
co-operation of Irishmen and Catholics. Few could divest 
themselves of the. belief that Laud had been the centre of a 
dark and hideous conspiracy, which was now exploding around 
them at every point.^ 

' The Scottish Dove. E. 75, 21. 

^ A curious reason for proceeding against Laud is given in l^he Com- 
plete Intelligencer (E. 75, 32). " Certainly the sparing of him hath been 
a great provocation to Heaven, for i* is a sign that we have not been so 



1643 ROYALIST PLANS. 247 

Therefore it was that the rancorous hatred with which Prynne 
had ransacked the Archbishop's cell in May, and had carried 
off every scrap of paper from which he could hope to extract 
evidence against him, at last bore fruit in October. On the 19th 
the Commons voted to present to the Peers further articles 
against the Archbishop, and on the 23rd the Peers ordered him 
to send in his answer. The proceedings thus launched would 
take their course, and it was at least better for Laud that he 
should meet his enemies face to face, rather than that, as 
had been barbarously proposed earlier in the year, he should 
be sent to New England to be baited as a bear at the stake by 
the separatists who had once fled before him.' 

The dread of a union between Cavalier and Papist which 
did so much to wreck Charles's cause, was baseless enough so 
Expected far as the bulk of Charles's supporters were concerned ; " 
between t)ut it was not basclcss as regarded Charles himself. 
an*°'"^ The regiment of English soldiers from Ireland, which 
Cavaliers, fj^d landed at Minehead, and had passed on to 
Bristol, was only the forerunner of the larger force, obtained 
by the connivance of Irish Catholics, which was to make it pos- 
sible for the King to take up once more his original plan of 
operating against London with three armies. If the old western 
army, under Prince Maurice, was engaged at Plymouth, and the 
old northern army was kept at bay by Manchester and the Fair- 
faxes, two new armies might be created. Hopton, 
be formed who had now recovered from his wounds, was avail- 
"onajid able to lead a force, partly composed of 2,000 Eng- 
^'™"" lish soldiers from Munster, through the southern coun- 

ties into Sussex and Kent ; whilst Sir John Byron, who had 
recently been created Lord Byron, was to take the command of 
a small army in Cheshire, which was to be reinforced by 4,000 
English soldiers from Leinster. His first work would be to 

careful to give the Church a sacrifice as the State. We could soon revenge 
our own injuries upon Strafford, but we have been slow and behind in 
revenging the cause of God upon Canterbury, he having corrupted our

overpower Brereton, who had occupied Warn, and was pushing 
Capel hard in Shropshire, and then to deHver Lancashire, which, 
with the exception of Lord Derby's home at Lathom House, 
was now entirely in the hands of the local Parliamentarians. 
After that he might either lend help to Newcastle in Yorkshire, 
or might fall upon the forces of the Eastern Association. 

So much might be easily learned by any of the principal 

military commanders at Oxford, What remained was communi- 

_ . cated in confidence to Ormond, who was now named 

Oct. lo. * 

Ormond' Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. A better choice could 

to be Lord ,_ - . i i 

Lieutenant hardly havc been made if Charles had sougnt with a 
single eye to mediate between infuriated Catholics 
and infuriated Protestants. A worse choice could hardly have 
been made if he merely needed a man to play off one party 
'against the other, and to win by intrigue what it was hopeless to 
obtain by force. 

Never did an unhappy official receive more intricate instruc- 
tions than those which were now transmitted to Ormond. In 
Oct. 19. the first place he was to induce the Irish to lend ships 
L"nETo''"°"^ to transport the English soldiers to England. He 
Ormond. ;va.s then to turn his attention to the Commissioners 
who were to be sent to Oxford by the Catholics to negotiate a 
permanent treaty of peace. If possible, he was to delay their 
coming, and if that could not be done he was to urge the 
Supreme Council not to bind them to put forward extravagant 
claims. It would be a still more important service if Ormond 
could succeed in preventing Monro and his Scottish army in 
Ulster from coming to England to fight for the Parliament as 
Ormond's own army was coming to England to fight for the 
King. 

To prevent a step so undesirable in his own interests Charles 
was prepared to descend to the lowest depths of intrigue. Or- 
mond was to recommend the Scots to listen to the English Par- 
liament, and to refuse to be bound by the cessation. As soon 
as a breach of the peace had been committed by the Scots, he 
was to invite the Irish to lay hold of that occasion and to fall 
upon them, promising them, if he saw fit to do so, that Charles 
would, in that case, take their further demands into favourable 



ifi.t3 CHARLES AND THE IRISH. 249 

consideration. On the other hand, if Monro persisted in a reso 
lution to transfer his army to England, he was to be ' attempted 
by money or gifts.' The Scottish colonists, too, were to be 
warned that Monro's desertion of Ireland would lead to their 
extirpation. If, in spite of all, Monro actually embarked, the 
Irish were to ' be incited to fall upon the inhabiting Scots, as 
the best means to draw back the auxiliaries in case the inhabit- 
ing Scots have not entirely submitted themselves to the cessa- 
tion.' There would not be much difficulty in persuading the 
Irish to a course so agreeable to their own interests, if they were 
put ' in hope to get the lands.' Nor was this all. After Monro's 
troops were fairly gone, the Irish were to be told that they could 
' in no ways so much recommend themselves to the King nor 
obtain for themselves such conditions as by following of them 
and falling upon them.' ' 

After this it is hardly necessary to ask why Charles's whole 
career ended in failure. The simplicity of aim which is the 
one common feature of the designs of the successful heroes and 
the successful villains of the world was wholly wanting to him. 
If the Parliamentary leaders had no knowledge of the details of 
his intrigues, they had no difficulty in divining their general 
tendency. Even the belief, widely prevalent in England, that 
Irish native troops had been sent over was not much, if at all, 
in advance of Charles's intentions. On November 10 Digby 
informed Ormond that the Kine was now ready to 

Nov, 10. ^ 

Irish to accept a proposal made by Lord Taaffe to bring over 
2,000 Irish, conceiving that he shall not only be ad- 
vantaged by their presence in the affairs of England, but also 
in the affairs of Ireland by their absence. " It is therefore," 
added Digby, " his Majesty's pleasure that your lordship give all 
possible furtherance to the coming over of as many of the princi- 
pal Irish as can be engaged, leaving the kingdom strong enough 
against the Scots." "^ 

It is not unlikely that some inkling of Ormond's instruc- 
tions reached the Parliamenffi.ry leaders through the lips of

lieved that greater energy would produce more successful 
Nov. 4. results. On November 4 he was placed at the head

The desertion of the Londoners was the more serious as it 

was evident that the King's troops from Ireland would take the 

field before the Scots were ready to cross the border. Hopton, 

bringing with him the regiments from Munster, was already on

northwards with a force of 1,300 men to join the recently 
landed soldiers, and to take the command of the united 
army.' 

The knowledge that they would have to prepare under 
such circumstances for a winter campaign in Hampshire and 
Cheshire was most unwelcome to the leaders at Westminster. 
To add to their perplexity, they learnt that even the friendly 
authorities of the City were dissatisfied with their financial

Experience was, in fact, teaching the Parh'amentary chiefs

ment of their duties as civilians. The Commons were not 
slow to perceive that the remedy lay in the encouragement of 
the system of standing armies, raised for permanent military 
service, and attached to the standards by the regularity of their 
pay. That system already existed, and it had only been the 
stress of danger which had led to its being supplemented by 
^^ the temporary expedient of an appeal to local forces.

30,404/., to be raised partly out of the assessments and partly 
out of the excise.^ 

It was a good beginning, if only it could be carried out in 
practice. Parliament would be all the stronger if its forces 
were reduced in numbers but rendered more efificient by the 
regularity of their pay. Yet the financial burdens already 
undertaken were so enormous as to render the prospect of 
such a solution well nigh desperate, and many a month was to 
pass away before the principle now enounced was finally to be 
adopted in fact. 

For the present, at least, time was not allowed for any 
transformation of Waller's army. During the greater part of

excellently officered, but the common men were mutinous, and 
shrewdly infected with the rebellious humour of England, 
being brought over merely by the virtue and loyalty of 
their officers, and large promises which there was then but 
small means to perform.' ' Not long before they had broken 
out into open mutiny when they had been sent to take part in 
the siege of Wardour Castle, and had been brought away by 
Hopton in the hope that they would do their duty if they were 
overawed by more loyal regiments. The King's plan of bring- 
ing soldiers from Ireland did not seem likely to meet with 
success. Their presence irritated the Parliamentarians, whilst 
they were themselves too strongly Protestant to have much 
heart in the royal cause. 

Hopton was further embarrassed by the want of confidence 
reposed in him at headquarters. His own wish had been to 
Hopton secure his rear before advancing, by the capture of 
ill-treated, ^jjg fortrcsscs held by Parliament in Wilts and 
Dorset, whilst the King, anxious to take up his old plan of an 
advance into Sussex and Kent, had, without any reference to 
him, authorised Sir \Villiam Ogle to surprise Winchester, and, 
when Ogle had accomplished this feat, had ordered his 
reluctant commander to move forward into Hampshire to 
Ogle's support.^ 

Hopton's nature was too loyal to revolt against the treat-

The capture of Arundel marked the high tide of Royalist 
success which had begun to swell at Stratton. It was soon to 
be discovered that the forces of which Charles could dispose 
were insufficient to support so daring a strategy. Hopton's 
little army was scattered over a tract of country too wide for 
safety in the presence of so able a tactician as Waller. On the 

jj^ early morning of the 13th the Parliamentary general 

The surprise fell upon Lord Crawford's quarters at Alton. Craw- 
ford escaped with the greater part of his horse, but 
his foot surrendered after a short resistance. Of near upon a 
thousand prisoners five hundred took the Covenant and trans- 
ferred their services to Parliament. The newsmongers at 
London had their laugh when they heard that Waller had re- 
captured a cask of sack which he had courteously presented to 
Crawford a few days before. It was of greater importance 
that the Westminster regiment, which had refused to advance 
at Basing, showed no signs of flinching at Alton.' 

The loss of Arundel, in fact, had roused London and the 
southern counties from their apathy. Two fresh regiments of 
Waller City trained bands had been despatched to take the 

reinforced, pig^e of those which had deserted their commander, 
and 600 horse were sent by Essex to complete Waller's force. 
If the majority of the gentry of Kent and Sussex were on the 
side of the King, the middle classes did not share their 
opinions, and even those who under ordinary circumstances 
would have wished to remain neutral had no desire to see 
their own district the seat of a desolating war. Hopton,

PRESBYTERIANS AND INDEPENDENTS. 

Long before the tidings of Waller's success reached London 
the statesman whose unflagging confidence during the darkest 
jg hours of adversity had made success possible was

months, and though at one time he seemed to be

recovermg, the improvement was not of long con- 
tinuance. In the early days of December, as he lay on his 
sick bed, he told his sorrowing friends that to him life or death 
was indifferent : — ' if he lived, he would do what service he 
could ; if he died, he should go to that God whom he had 
served, and who would carry on His work by some others.' 
Pym's disease was an internal abscess, and on the evening of 

Dec. 8. December 8 he died.^ On the 15th Lords and 
of Pyni!''' Commons, accompanied by the Assembly of Divines,

precedented step the Commons voted 10,000/. for the payment 
of the debts of the man who, abandoning himself to the ser- 
vice of the State, had impoverished his own family. 

" I beseech you," said Stephen Marshall in his funeral

sermon before the assembled Houses, "let not any of you 
have one sad thought touching him ; nor, secondly, would I 
have you mourn out of any such apprehension as the enemies 
have, and for which they rejoice, as if our cause were not good, 
or we should lose it for want of hands to carry it on. No, 
beloved, this cause must prosper ; and although we were all 
dead, our armies overthrown, and even our Parliaments dis- 
solved, this cause must prevail." 

" The greatest liberty of our kingdom,'' Pym had once 
said, " is religion." ' In this characteristic utter.ince he gave 

the key to his life's work. Above all existing law, 
character above all popular rights, he placed religion. For- 

him, however, religion did not stand in opposition to 
the world and the things of the world. He never thought of 
deserting work amongst his fellow-men to devote himself to 
the salvation of his own soul. Divine laws, apprehended by 
the individual conscience, were to be applied to the govern- 
ment of society, and these laws were, in his mind, very closely 
connected with the existing laws of England. The nature of 
the struggle against Charles and Laud led him to look to Par- 
liament as a fitting instrument of government wherewith to 
replace the failing authority of the King, though he never 
idealised Parliament quite as much as Eliot had done. Unlike 
Eliot, he lived long enough to see the principles which he 
cherished rejected by one House of Parliament, and supported 
only by a minority in the other, who, through the desertion of 
a large number of their fellow- members, were able to pose as 
a majority. His situation was one to tesi the strongest brain- 
one, it may fairly be said, from the difficulties of which no 
single brain was capable of discovering a way of escape. If 
Pym had been a mere Parliamentarian, wishing to substitute 
the sovereignty of the many for the sovereignty of one, his 
work would have been, intellectually at least, comparatively 
easy. His difficulties arose from his recognition that more 
than the form of government was at stake, and from his belief 
that religion — or, in other words, Puritanism— must be upheld 

' A short view of the life and actions of . . . John Pym. E. 68, 13. 



»643 PYM'S STATESMANSHIP. 357 

if the nation were to live, even against the will of the nation 
itself. 

In Pym's days the modern system of party government 
was beyond reach, as neither the constitutional habit nor the

part" tial to the maintenance of that habit, was in exis- 

government. tencc. What Pym did was to attempt to replace 
the monarchical organisation by an organisation resting on 
voluntary association. In 1621 his first recorded Parliamentary 
utterance asked for ' an oath of association ' to secure English- 
men against the Catholics at home, ' and that those who should 
refuse the same should not hold any office in the common- 
wealth.' This proposal, which grew out of the Association of 
1584, was the germ of the Protestation of 1641, and of the 
Parliamentary Covenant of 1643, if not of the Solemn League 
and Covenant itself. 

Out of the idea of mutual association in defence of a 
principle, as better than mutual association in defence of a 
person, party government would eventually grow. Its time 
was not yet come. Not only did the new system then, as ever, 
find itself scouted by those who clung to older forms, but all 
healthy political development was made impossible by the 
King. In that adherence to narrow legality tempered by a 
mixture of force and intrigue, which was Charles's ideal of 
statesmanship, Pym at once recognised a disturbing element to 
be cast out at all hazards, even if its existence necessitated an 
appeal to the arbitrament of the sword. 

Under the stress of this danger Pym threw away one half 
of his creed in order to preserve intact the other and the 
nobler half. It is true that the religion of Falkland and of 
Jeremy Taylor was as elevated as that of Winthrop and 
Baxter, but the pressing question of the day was not whether 
one belief could subsist side by side with the other, but whether 
one was to be imposed on the other by the aid of army plots 
and Irish cessations. Before this danger Puritanism stiffened 
itself for the conflict, and it found its leader in Pym. There 
was to be no counting of heads — no trust in old constitutional 
forms. If the Lords would not join the Commons, the 

VOL. I. S 



158 PRESBYTERIANS AND INDEPENDENTS. CH. xm 

Commons would save the State without them. If the Com- 
mons hesitated, the shouts of the citizens must awaken them 
to their duty. 

When the danger passed away Pym's services would be for- 
gotten, or would be counted as crimes. As long as Charles 
lived services such as his could not be dispensed with. Hon- 
ourable combination with men of good-will to the cause which 
they reverenced was Pym's defence against the shifty politics 
of Charles. The power of a resolute and devoted minority 
was to be opposed to the weakness of a distracted majority, 
and until that majority should obtain the coherence which 
alone could make it strong, the fewer in number were certain 
to prevail. 

Whatever differences of opinion there may be with regard 
to Pym's aims, there can be none as to the spirit in which he 
pursued them. In his personal dealings with men of his own 
party there was no assumption of superiority, no contemptuous 
disregard for those who differed from him. It is hard from 
such record of the Parliamentary debates as remains to us to 
recognise him as a leader at all. He worked by influence, not 
by eloquence ; and his influence was founded on his power of 
distinguishing the important points of a complicated situation 
from those which were comparatively unimportant. Hence his 
anxiety to gain allies by any concession of which circumstances 
would admit. During the crisis of July and August he had 
succeeded in reconciling Essex to his duty to the Parliamentary 
cause. In accepting the Covenant he had striven to give it as 
wide an interpretation as possible. Those who speak of him 
as the leader of the Presbyterian party mistake the nature of 
the man. He was neither Episcopalian nor Presbyterian by 
conviction. He regarded forms of church government as of 
very secondary importance. In the last speech which he is 
known to have uttered in Parliament,^ he based his acceptance 
of the abolition of Episcopacy solely on the strength which 
that abolition would give to those who were fighting against 
Charles. The one thing which he asked for the Church was 

' See p. 233. 



1643 RIVAL PARLIAMENTS. 259 

that it should be sincerely Protestant. All else was but a 
matter of expediency. 

It may be that Pym was happy in the opportunity of his 
death. New issues were opening before the nation, with 
respect to which his judgment was likely to be at fault. His 
own greatness, was, unlike that of Strafford, the greatness of 
one who embraces much to which he can give no definite form. 
The whole future constitution of England was in his mind, but 
it was there in a fluid state, incapable as yet of being reduced 
into practical shape. King and Lords and Commons were 
there, with the Commons to give the decisive word. The right 
of appeal from the House of Commons to outside opinion 
was there, and due submission to the majesty of the law was 
there as well. Party discipline and combination filled no small 
place in his plans. All these things floated before him as the 
wreaths of smoke which poured from the opened casket in 
the Arabian tale. The time would come when the coiling 
vapours would take shape in that settlement of the Re- 
volution of 1688, which was one day to give repose to 
England. 

When Pym died there was sorrow and regret, but there 
was no wail of despair. The Parliamentary party was not 
likely to perish with him, and as long as Charles lived and 
reigned it would in some form or other continue to exist. 

To meet Pym with an ecclesiastical policy broader and 
nobler than any that had yet been enunciated was beyond 
Charles's power, but he could hardly fail to perceive the strength 
which his adversaries derived from the mere name of Parlia- 
ment. That strength he was now resolved to have upon his 
Dec. 22. own side. On December 22 he summoned all the 
Sl^OTs members of either House who had left Westminster 
ttrmiTat' already, or were willing to leave it on promise of 
Oxford. pardon, to meet on January 22 in Parliament at 
Oxford. Forgetful of his own transactions with the Irish, he 
was prepared to stand forth as the champion of English 
nationality, and to call on the loyal Houses to express their 
indignation at the invitation given to the Scots to invade 
England.

That the meeting of a partisan Parliament at Oxford should 
lead to a good understanding with the partisan Parliament at 
, , , Westminster was most improbable. Charles's only 

A broader ^ r i_ j j 

policy real chance lay in the enunciation of a broader and 

more attractive policy, which would rally to his 
side, not indeed his opponents in the field and in the senate, 
but the nation as a whole. Neither himself nor his advisers 
were capable of devising such a policy. The military party, 
headed by Rupert, urged him to finish the war by victory, not 
by negotiation. Digby, the mercurial Secretary of State, had 
favoured the transportation of the Irish army to England, and 
he was equally ready to break the strength of his adversaries 
by winning over to his side either classes or individuals to 
whom he had anything to offer. Statesmanship became in 
Digby's hands a mere policy of intrigue. 

By this time parties were more thoroughly divided by their 

religious proclivities than they had been some months before, 

and the conduct of the Hothams and of Sir Alexander 

Attempts . . ^^ . 

to gain Carew was not likely to find imitators. Captain 
ham and Backhouse, who had been invited to betray

pretended to enter into the plot in order that he might lure 
his adversaries to their destruction. The nobler Colonel 
Hutchinson, to whom 10,000/. and a peerage was offered in 
the handwriting of Newcastle himself, as the purchase-money of 
the betrayal of Nottingham, scornfully rejected the temptation.' 
Digby had a larger net to throw than might suffice for the 
gaining possession of a fortress or a town. For some months 
a movement had been gathering head at Westminster which he 
hoped to turn to the profit of his master. 

The evident wish of the great majority of the divines in the 
Assembly to impose Presbyterianism upon the nation had met 
Opposition with unlooked-for opposition. The old Separatists,

positions at Rotterdam or Arnheim. Though concurring in 
the main with the Separatist ideas on church government, 
they had refused to follow them in denouncing the Church of 
England as apostate, and they fancied that they had hit upon a 
wise middle course between the loose independency of the 
Separatists and the iron discipline of the Presbyterians. They 
■ held that no congregation ought to be subjected 

indepen- to cocrcive jurisdiction outside itself, though they 
'""^^ allowed to each congregation the right of remon- 

strating against the proceedings of any other, and even, if it 
saw fit so to do, of refusing to hold communion with it. The 
theory adopted by the five dissenting brethren, as they came 
to be called in the Assembly, was only one of many which 
were floating about at a time when the existing church organi- 
sation was thrown into the crucible. Its importance lay in the 
fact that it was vigorously defended by men of ability and 
culture, and was by them cleared from the harsh and un- 
charitable judgments which gave reasonable offence in the 
mouths of many of the older Separatists. It was only 
indirectly, by weakening the clerical organisation and by 
strengthening the authority of the laity, whose influence was 
more likely to prevail in separate congregations than in the 
larger Presbyterian assemblies, that it appealed to the deeply 
seated English suspicion of clerical rule. 

That suspicion had been recently invigorated by the 
imposition of the Covenant and the calling in of the Scots. 
The last achievement of Pym's statesmanship, which 
against the had made more bitter the bitterness of Oxford, and 
Covenant, j^^^ made it possible for Charles once more to gathei 
a Parliament around him, was driving the more resolute 
Puritans in an opposite direction. Men who had struck out

for themselves some new theological system, and who had lost 
all sense of proportion in the intentness of their gaze upon 
one biblical doctrine or the other, made common cause with 
men who, like the dissenting brethren, accepted the received 
theology of the day, but who objected to the imposition even 
of their own beliefs by an external clerical authority. 

The Independency of the Civil War was the joint product 

of these two factors. The former derived its strength from the 

lower classes in the towns, from the yeomanry in the 

The new , . „ . , ,,. 

indepen- country, and more especially from those soldiers m 
^""^^^ the army who had come forth from amongst the 

yeomanry at Cromwell's bidding, and who, inspired with all the 
vigour which a self-chosen belief brings with it, were beginning 
to be known amongst themselves as the godly party. Amongst 
these men the Covenant was regarded as a mark of bondage. 
Cromwell himself had deferred his adhesion to it as long as it 
was possible to do so, and in London many of the more fiery 
rroposed Spirits prepared a petition to Parliament, in which 
agLSthe t^^y denounced the tyranny of Presbyterianism, and 
Covenant, declared that if the Covenant were enforced they 
would induce the soldiers of their way of thinking to lay down 
their arms. It was only at the urgent entreaty of Nye that 
the petition was suppressed by those who had drawn it up.' 

Nye, it may be supposed, acted as the mouthpiece of the 
Assembly Independents, who still cherished a hope that the

minuteness. The spirit of the Assembly was thoroughly in

accordance with Vane's amendment. Its members cared 

much less about the example of the best reformed Churches 

than about the authoritative doctrine of the Word of God. 

What that doctrine was it was not easy to discover. Efforts were 

made to construe writings which bristled with metaphor and 

allusion as if they were Acts of Parliament. Yet, after all, no 

man, and especially no assembly of men, is guided by logic 

alone. The example of the vigour of the Scottish Church 

Presby- Weighed in the balance more heavily than its 

fevour'ld authority. When, after some weeks' debate, the 

^y "■ first steps were taken in favour of the Presbyterian 

system, it became evident that the organisation of the Church 

of Scotland would, as far as the Westminster Assembly could 

prevail, be adopted in England as well. 

The burden of what opposition there, was fell upon the five 

dissenting brethren. It is unnecessary to recite the details of 

„ . . the struggle. It is enough to remember the differ-

tention. Ihe Presbyterian ideal was an official 
Church with the right of enforcing discipline on recalcitrant 
members, and resting on the general support of Puritan 
Englishmen. The Independent ideal was the abolition of 
coercive discipline over congregations in which the lay 
element would obtain, by the very fact of its direct incidence, 
a preponderating influence. 

Outside the doors of the Assembly feeling was likely to be 
divided. If the Independents had on their side the English 
p ,|. dislike of clerical rule, they had against them the 

opinion. English dislike of strange opinions. From such 
opinions they were themselves entirely free. They had no 
wish to re- baptise infants, to declaim against the sinful- 
ness of regarding the moral law, or to deny the divinity of 
the Saviour. ' Nevertheless, they had to share in the un- 
popularity of those who did. Many a sober Englishman who 
had rebelled against the tyranny of Laud refused to allow 
doctrines to be openly preached which appeared to sap the 
very foundations of morality as well as of religion. The 
question of Presbyterianism or Independency would be thrust 



264 PRESBYTERIANS AND INDEPENDENTS. CH. xiu 

into the background, and the question of toleration or no 
toleration would take its place. 

It was no wonder therefore that the Assembly Indepen- 
dents should feel their relations with the members of the sects 
to be somewhat uncertain. The successful intervention of 
Nye to stop the presentation of the petition against the 
Covenant is sufficient evidence that the two wings of the party 
had been forced into accord by the common dread lest the 
Scots should impose Presbyterianism by force of arms. The 
same dread led to negotiations of an unexpected kind. The

regarded as their bitterest enemies. An intermediary was 
found in a certain Thomas Ogle, who had been connected 
with the plots of Sir Nicholas Crisp,' and who, on some charge, 
the nature of which is now unknown, had been lying in various 
prisons for nearly seven months. 

The result of the communications thus opened between 
the sects and the Royalists of the Peace-party was a resolution 
to appeal to Charles for a settlement which it seemed hopeless 
to expect from a Parliament which had called in the Scots. 
The terms agreed to were to be forwarded by Ogle to Bristol, 
the least bigoted of Charles's influential adherents. The letter 
which Ogle wrote to accompany these proposals was dated

The propositions forwarded to Bristol asked that Episcopal 
government might be retained, though the whole of the exist- 
ing Episcopate was to be deprived of office. Their successors 
were to be such as 'through their unblameable lives and 
doctrine have interest in the people's affection.' Visitors were

to be appointed to abolish obnoxious ceremonies, justice was to 
be done to those who had suffered in past times, and the trial 
of delinquents was to be conducted either by a known law or 
in full and free Parliament. The breach between King and 
Parliament was to be repaired, and Charles was to admit to 
audience some persons selected by the thousands in London 
who wished to be eased of the burdens laid on them by the 
Bishops.' 

A popular Episcopacy with toleration for those who 
declined to submit to the Episcopal system was the burden of 
Gist of the these proposals. In the main it was the settlement 
proposals. Qf jggg anticipated. No special blame is due to 
Charles for rejecting an offer which would have been equally 
rejected by the great majority of his opponents. Where 
he went wrong was that, instead of accepting or reject- 
ing so important an overture on its own merits, he allowed 
himself to be entangled by it in an intrigue, the discovery of 
which inflicted a severe blow on the royal cause. The 
Parliamentary garrison of Aylesbury had long been a 
betrayal of thom in the side of the King's commanders, and 
^ " "^' when Ogle intimated that an officer of the garrison, 
Colonel Mozley, was prepared to betray Aylesbury, as a proof 
of the serious intentions of the negotiators, Charles's interest 
was at once aroused. He was also told that Devenish, the 
keeper of the prison in which Ogle was, would connive at his 
prisoner's escape, in order that he might come to Oxford to 
explain the whole matter in person. 

Already Ogle's plot was being met by a counter-plot. 
Both Mozley and Devenish had communicated their know- 
Thepiot ledge to the Committee of Safety, and the letters 
betrayed. which passed between the conspirators and Oxford 
were duly laid, either in the original or in copy, before 
that body. In this way the Committee learned that on De- 
cember 7 a bill of exchange for 100/. had been sent to Ogle, 
together with a safe conduct for three persons to come to 
Oxford to carry on the negotiations. Three or four days later

Mozley was in London, ostensibly to ask for money for the 
garrison of Aylesbury, but mainly, it would seem, to arrange 
with the Parliamentary leaders the mode in which Charles's 
1644. plot was to be met. Early in January Ogle was 
Ogfe"^'^'' allowed to escape, and appeared at Oxford, where he 
Oxford. urged the acceptance of the propositions of the 
Independents, without, the faintest suspicion that every 
step taken by him was duly noted at Westminster. On 
January 5 Devenish wrote to Bristol, telling him that Ogle 
before leaving London had held a conversation with Nye and 
Goodwin, and had found them very reticent in con- 

Nye and r i &lt;- 

Goodwin sequence or the want of an answer from the Kmg to 
assure them ' what they may trust to.' Without a 
definite understanding with Charles they could not engage 
themselves ; ' for if they have nothing to move them by way 
of allurement, and that all shall be left to their jealousy and 
fear of the Scotch and Presbytery, it may prevail with them 
perhaps to retire, but not apply themselves to the King with- 
out some reasonable invitations, which these very fears and 
jealousies may make way for the embracement of.' ' 

Though it is far from certain that these words were spoken 

by Nye and Goodwin, there is at least a strong probability 

that they express the feelings which they entertained towards 

the King. Charles had shown great haste to get possession 

of Aylesbury, but no eagerness whatever to adopt a policy of 

wise toleration. Bristol was, no doubt, more accessible to 

large ideas than his master, but his language was far too vague 

to attract men whose hearts were set on solving a great 

spiritual problem. " You go,'' he had written to 

Dec. 19. Mozley, "upon a good ground, and such a one as 

letter to must Unite all honest Englishmen, although in other 

°^ ^' things of different minds, which is not to be overrun 

by an invasion of the Scots, who, if they should prevail, will 

tyrannise both over our estates and consciences." ^

Not only was the acceptance of the Independent scheme 
by Charles extremely uncertain, but in the last weeks of the 
Ho es of ^^^"^ ^^^ Independents in the Assembly were able to 
the inde- entertain hopes of obtaining from that body all that' 
from the they could reasonably desire. It is possible that the 
sem y. (jjjgg members of the Committee of Safety who, on 
December 11, learned the secret of the negotiations with the 
King, intimated to the Presbyterians in the Assembly that it 
would be dangerous to push the Independents to the wall. 
Even if this was not the case, it was evident that it was no 
time to divide the Parliamentary party, when Pym was no longer 
there to lead them, and when Towcester and Arundel were 
both occupied by Royalist garrisons. Even Baillie, who had 
recently arrived to attend the meetings of the Assembly as a 
Scottish Commissioner, and who hated the very idea of 
toleration with a perfect hatred, was convinced that for a time 
at least the Independents must be conciliated. " With them," 
he naively wrote on December 7, " we purpose not to meddle 
in haste, lill it please God to advance our army, which we 
expect will much assist our arguments." ' Other reasons too 
there were for yielding something. No strong Presbyterian 
party was yet formed amongst the laity, and it was perhaps 
hardly possible to form one till Independency came to be 
associated with military aggression. In the meanwhile greater 
dangers than were to be feared from the Assembly Independents 
were impending. " In the time of this anarchy," complained 
Baillie, about December 14, "the divisions of people weekly 
does much increase. The Independent party grows, but the 
Anabaptists more, and the Antinomians most. As yet a 
Presbytery to this people is conceived a strange monster." '^ 
Before long it was a matter of general knowledge that some 
negotiations had been opened between the Independents and 
the King. "I know," wrote Baillie on January i, "they have 
offers from the Court of all they require." ' 

The conciliatory feeling generated by this condition of affairs 
found expression in a declaration issued on December 23 in the 

' Baillie, ii. in. * Itid. ii. ii7- " I^d- "• «33- 



268 PRESBYTERIANS ANt) INDEPENDENTS. CH. xiil. 

name of the Assembly.* Though, as far as its title went, it 
was a warning against the gathering of new congregations, the 

Dec. 23. Assembly in point of fact offered to ' concur to preserve 
by th^"°" whatever should appear to be the rights of particular 
Assembly, congregations, according to the Word ; and to bear 
with such whose consciences cannot in all things conform to 
the public rule, as far as the Word of God would have them 
borne withal.' To this declaration were appended the 
signatures of such decided Presbyterians as Twiss and Marshall, 
Herle and Palmer, and the five dissenting brethren were fairly 
justified in believing that more was to be obtained from 
the Assembly than they had any reason to expect from 
Charles. 

Yet, either because the five distrusted the majority of the 
Assembly, or because they wished to bring before the know- 
ledge of the public their real wishes, they published 

Jan. I (!) about the beginning of the new year a statement of 
logetica" their views. From the Apologetical Narration, as 

arration. ^j^^^ termed it, it appeared that they were not in 
agreement with the authors of the propositions sent to Charles 
in asking for liberty to form separate congregations uncon- 
nected with the principal Church of the nation. What they 
asked was that no ecclesiastical assembly should exercise any 
coercive jurisdiction at all. Such coercive jurisdiction as might 
be necessary was to be exercised directly by the State.^ 

The Apologetical Narration was therefore rather an appeal 

against clericalism than a complete vindication of liberty of 

conscience. Its authors were not long in assuring themselves 

what they had strongly suspected already, that nothing was to 

be expected from Charles. On January 6, Ogle

satisfied in such a way as to content all discreet persons. ' The 
want of precision in Bristol's overtures, coupled with the appeal 
to the lowest motives contained in Ogle's offers, was in itself cal- 
culated to warn Nye and his fellows off the track, even if their 
knowledge of the plot for the betrayal of Aylesbury had not 
made them shy before. Still more untrustworthy must Charles 
have appeared to them when they learned that he was engaged 
in yet another intrigue, of which the threads were kept dis- 
tinct from those in which he was attempting to involve them- 
selves. 

Some time before Ogle opened communications with the 
King, Colonel Reade, the officer who had been tortured in 

, Dublin,^ and who had long been a prisoner in the 

December. Towcr, had made his escape to Oxford, and had 

Reade and 

Brooke's entertained Charles with tales of the good- will of the 
*" ° ' Londoners. Himself a Catholic, he urged the King 

to open a correspondence with Sir Basil Brooke, a Catholic 
who in Charles's palmy days had risen to favour under Port- 
land's protection, and who, in the time of trouble, had negotiated 
with the Catholics for their support to the throne. Brooke 
agreed to do his utmost to win over the City to Charles's cause. 
He was the more hopeful, as in the end of 1643 there was a 
widespread dissatisfaction with the absorption of the trained 
bands in distant military enterprises, and with the ruinous 
effects of the prolongation of the war upon trade. Brooke's 
main instruments were Violet, a Royalist goldsmith, who had 
been in prison for refusing to pay his share of the Parliamentary 
taxation, and Riley, a scout-master, who would be able to bring 
him into communication with the disaffected militiamen. 
Charles was sanguine enough to imagine that if he addressed a 
letter to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen assuring them of his 
constancy in religion, they would at once break with the Parlia- 
ment and declare for peace. 

The scheme was favoured by the Queen and the Duchess 
of Buckingham, and on December 26 the letter was despatched. 
As so often happened with Charles's compromising despatches, 

' A secret negotiation, 27, 31. Caind. Misc. vol. viii,

it fell into the hands of the Committee of Safety. Even ii 
the scheme had been more promising than it was, it was in- 
credibly foolhardy to entrust its execution to a handful of 
The plot schemers, of whom the principal were Catholics. The 
discovered, jgjjg^ jjggjf contained no hint at that liberty of con- 
science which was the corner-stone of the negotiation with 
the Independents, and it therefore led surely to the conclu- 
sion which most men had reached already, that Charles was 
ready to make himself all things to all men, with no intention 
of fulfilling any one of his promises, and with the absolute 
impossibility of fulfilling all.' 

Ogle's plot was not yet ripe for discussion in the House ot 
Commons, if the time was ever to arrive. The attempt on 
Ogle's plot Aylesbury had not yet been made, and it was un- 
not revealed, (jgsirable to compromise the Independents by 
revealing all that had taken place. The denunciation of 
Brooke's plot was admirably suited for a rallying cry. On 

January 6 the Commons were informed of their 

Jan. 6. danger. The irritation was the greater as with the 

piotde- intercepted letter had been seized a copy of the 

King's proclamation, summoning Parliament to 
Oxford. On the 8th the Lords not only showed that they 
shared in the angry feeling of the Commons, but gave 
signs of an intention to proceed with the Queen's impeach- 
ment.^ 

Two days later the Houses were reminded that, con- 
currently with the intrigues which had recently been brought 
to light in England and Ireland, there was an outer network 
of diplomacy, the object of which was to rouse foreign Powers 
to afford moral or material assistance to the King in his war 
^g with his own subjects. One danger indeed was now 

War be- happily averted. A war had broken out between

were to have been purchased by the cession ot

Louis XIII. had died in May, and in the minority of his 
successor, Louis XIV., his widow, Anne of Austria, exercised 
jjay i . the sovereignty as regent. Though she was utterly 
Death 'of devoid of the political spirit, she could rouse herself

maternal instinct hindered her from carrying out, now that 
. she was in power, the schemes in favour of Spain 

Austria and to which shc had lent too ready an ear as a neglected 
wife. Mazarin, who, with a fine sense of the limits 
which separate the possible and the impossible, was already 
carrying out with success the anti-Spanish policy of the Iron 
Cardinal, won her respect alike by his skill in baffling political 
intrigues and by the fame which accrued to her by victories in 
the field. So firmly, indeed, did she cling to the minister, that 
a not very probable rumour asserted that respect before long 
warmed into a tenderer feeling, consecrated by the bond of a 
secret marriage.' The first days of the new reign were 
brightened by the tidings that the young Duke of Enghien, 
g neglecting the advice of older warriors, had dashed 
's' to pieces at Rocroi that Spanish infantry which foi 
Rocroi. more than a century had given to Spain military 
predominance in Europe. Enghien followed up the blow in 
August by the capture of Thionville. The Spanish frontier 
definitely receded before the French armies. 

The protection of France was now indeed worth having, 
and it was with no slight satisfaction that Charles heard that a 
French ambassador was on his way to mediate a 
Harcourt's peacc in England — a peace the terms of which, as 
misaon. might easily be concluded, would be very different 
from those which he had rejected at Oxford. When, early in 
October, Harcourt, who was entrusted with this mission 

' Cheruel, Hist, de France pendant la minoritl de Lmis XIV. ii. 136. 



272 PRESBYTERIANS AND INDEPENDENTS. CH. xin 

arrived in London, he was welcomed by crowds weary of the 
war with shouts of "God bless the prince who brings us 
peace ! " ' The Parliamentary leaders were less 
(ague im- enthusiastic. They seized on Walter Montague, who 
pnsone . accompanied the ambassador, and shut him up in 
the Tower, as being liable as a priest of English birth to 
English law ; and upon the ground that Harcourt refused to 
acknowledge the Houses as the Parliament of England they 
refused him the audience which he demanded.^ 

In November, therefore, Harcourt betook himself to Oxford. 

What passed there was veiled in secrecy, and when, early in 

1644. January, a letter of Digby's was intercepted, in which 

Harcourt's '^ ^^^ Stated that Harcourt's mission had failed as

have failed, bccausc Charles had refused to acknowledge the 
Houses as a 'Parliament, there must have been a feeling of 
relief amongst all who regarded a French mediation with 
suspicion. 

On January 10 the Houses learnt that they had congratu- 
lated themselves too soon. Another intercepted letter — this 
time from Lord Goring, the King's ambassador in 
Goring"' Paris — told another tale. Harcourt had been dis- 
'"'°'' cussing a proposal for a league between Charles and 

Harcourt's the Queen Regent of France, and if the league had

had overreached himself by demanding too much and offering 
too little. Mazarin, however, had assured Goring that if 
Harcourt's mediation failed he was ready to serve their 
Majesties to the utmost in arms or money, and though diplo- 
matic assurances might not go very far. Goring at least believed 
that a loan of money would be easily attainable, as well as an 
actual declaration of the enmity of France against the Parlia- 
ments of England and Scotland. Goring, too, had succeeded 
in obtaining large sums of money for the Queen's jewels, which

he had pawned, and was sending a considerable store of arms 
to England.' 

Before Goring's letter was read in the Commons an appeal 
had been made by the Houses, not to the Lord Mayor and 
Jan. 8. Aldermen, but to the more popular assembly of the 
^rpe?w'" Common Hall. The disclosure of Brooke's plot was 
the City. received with the greatest indignation. On the 13th 
the Sheriffs and the Aldermen, probably knowing that some at 
least of their number were regarded with suspicion, invited the 
two Houses, together with the Scots Commissioners and the 
Assembly of Divines, to a banquet, to be given as a manifesta- 
tion of the City's resolution to maintain its union with the 
bodies invited in spite of Charles's efforts to divide theni.^ 

The banquet was given on the i8th in Merchant Taylors' 
Hall. In a preliminary sermon Stephen Marshall urged the 
necessity of union. He drew special attention to 
The City' the Unprincipled combinations of their adversaries, 
anquet. „ ygy gjjg^jj ggg them," he said, " sending into France,

deavours are used ! what sort of men is not attempted — what 
profession soever they be of — be they Jesuits, be they friars, be 
they priests, be they professors, be they such as they call 
Puritans." ^ Only a few of Marshall's hearers would recognise 
the meaning of the last allusion, but the general bearing of the 
passage would be in accordance with the feeling of all. If it 
is too much to say that the vast audience was as united as it 
professed to be, at least it was far more united than could have 
been possible a month before, and for this Charles was mainly 
responsible. 

As might have been expected, the fact that Catholics had 

been largely employed in the recent plot was thrust into 

the foreground. When the procession swept along

bonfire delighted the multitude. Inside the hall, as soon as the 
banquet was over, Dr. Burgess called upon all present to sing 
the eighty-fifth Psalm, the psalm of joy in the Divine forgive- 
ness, of the union of mercy and peace, of truth and righteous- 
ness.' 

In that song Cromwell and Warwick joined with Manchester 
and Essex. One day divisions might spring up between them, 
but for the present their hearts were united. No offer made 
by Charles had a chance of being taken seriously ; yet so little 
intelligence had Charles that the effect of the discovery of his 
intrigue with the City was simply to throw him back on his in- 
trigue with the Independents. If any man had succeeded to 
„ ^ . the authority of Pym it was the younger Vane. In 

offers his advocacy of the most trenchant measures against 

liberty of •' ,.,. .. -, , 

conscience the royal power, and m his conviction of the useless- 
ness of negotiation. Vane's sentiments were even 
more decided than those of Pym ; but he had given proofs 
whilst he sojourned in America of his devotion to the new 
principle — still imperfectly understood even by many of its 
champions — of liberty of conscience. Through Lord Lovelace 
Charles now assured Vane of his readiness to grant that liberty. 
Vane can never for one moment have supposed that Charles's 
mind had been suddenly illuminated. The befitting reply 
would have been to request Charles, as Philip of Spain had re- 
quested him at Madrid, to put his offers in practice before using 
them as a weapon of diplomacy. Instead of answering thus, 
Vane, himself not unversed in diplomatic art, affected to 
believe Charles to be in earnest, probably in the hope of dis- 
covering the secrets of the enemy. The negotiation was not 
long-lived, as its existence was soon discovered by Essex, who 
took offence at the initiation of a secret understanding without 
reference to himself. Incidentally the affair nearly led to a 
quarrel between the two Houses. The Lords were not only 
inclined to support Essex as a peer, but they were specially 
offended with Vane, as having thrown obstacles in the way of 
Holland's restoration to his seat in Parliament.^

CHAPTER XtV 

LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE 

Charles's clumsy efforts to divide his oppoftehts had only re 
suited in knitting them more closely together. Success never

irbert'°not P^rposcs ; and seldom indeed did Charles show any 
yet a pro- sign of doing more than this. The idea of liberty of 

blemfor . " , 1 ■, , ,- 

practical conscicnce was as yet too new to be adopted by any of 
those practical statesmen who had to rest upon that 
general public opinion into which it had not yet insinuated itself ; 
and though it is true that during the next few years special causes 
brought it prominently before the thoughts of Englishmen, 
there was no evidence of permanency in that early growth, 
and it was not till a generation had passed away that it rooted 
itself firmly in the soil. Yet already the pioneers were at work, 
each cutting his way aloof from the other through the dense 
thicket of the prejudice of centuries. 

Neither of the two great parties into which England was 
divided can claim the final victory as entirely their own. The 
Two sons of the Renaissance, who had been temporarily 

worlfing for merged in the Cavalier party, prepared the way for 
libtrty. Locke and the ' Letters on Toleration.' The sons of 
the Protestant Reformation, temporarily merged in the Par- 
liamentary party, prepared the way for Milton and the ' Areo- 
pagitica.' Of the former the best representatives were Fuller 
and Chillingworth, of the latter Roger Williams. 

Of the larger-minded men who were working for liberty, 
the most comprehensive in his genius was Thomas Fuller. 
To a place amongst logical reasoners he makes no claim, but 



i644 FULLER. 277 

the abounding wit which rested on his instinctive recognition 
of resemblances where no one else would have thought of 
Thomas looking for them was mentally connected with his 
Fuller. gjjjj ijiore abounding charity, ever finding points of 

sympathy in the midst of discord. His burly frame, his 
broad countenance beaming with good-nature, betokened a 
man with whom it was impossible to quarrel. The sharpest 
and most unjust criticism never drew from him an angry word. 
No one ever formed warmer or more enduring friendships, and 
before he died he counted amongst his friends, in addition to 
Cavaliers who had followed Charles in his adversity, at least 
one of that stern band which had sentenced their king to death. 
Such a career might have been that of a time-server, but a time- 
server Fuller never was. His warmth of heart and the roomi- 
ness of his mind embraced every man of good-will, and fixed 
upon whatever of purity or nobleness might be in him as the 
bee fixes on the honey. 

Fuller was a nephew of Davenant, the Calvinist Bishop of 
Salisbury, and as a member of the Convocation which passed 

the new canons after the dissolution of the Short Par- 
1640. 
Fuller in liamcnt, he had opposed the system of Laud without 

ca°ion': siding with the stricter Puritans. In 1641 he sat in 

1641. the sub-committee which strove, under the chairman- 

Commiue?;^ ship of Williams, to prepare a scheme which might 

and at the rcstore harmony to the Church. The Chapel of the 

*™^' Savoy, whenever he preached as chaplain, was filled 

to overflowing with an enthusiastic and intelligent audience. 

If it was impossible for him to keep entirely aloof from 

the strife of the day, it was equally impossible for him to speak a 

word with any other object than to allay its bitterness. 

During the first winter of the war Fuller made it evident 

that he had thrown in his lot with the Peace-party led by Holies 

and Maynard.' His first published sermon, preached on 

' The materials for the early part of Fuller's history have been care- 
fully worked up by Mr. J. E. Bailey in his admirable Life of Fuller. 
Mr. Bailey, however, writing at a time when the proceedings of the 
Peace-party were almost entirely veiled in MS , makes Fuller, in my 
opinion, too directlv a Royalist at this period of his life. The language

these men were giving utterance in the House of Commons.

party. 26th/ he took for his text, "Blessed are the peace- 

makers." During the past weeks the cry of " No peace without 
truth ! " had been ringing through the streets. In answer, 
Fuller avowed his conviction that durine; the two

not discern between error and falsehood. It had ' two edges, 
but never an eye.' In a fair discussion by a synod of divines, 
and in the ultimate arbitration of supreme authority, lay the 
only path of safety. " Think not," he added, defying the pre- 
judices of his hearers as well as their opinions, " that the King's 
army is like Sodom, not ten righteous men in it, and the other 
army like Sion, consisting all of saints." ^ 

Three months later, when, on March 27, 1643, Fuller 
preached at Westminster, his royalism was more pronounced. 
The negotiations at Oxford, though trembling in the 
His'roy-'''' balance, were not as yet wholly broken off, and the 
^''*'"' preacher, no longer content with a vague reference to 

the decision of the supreme authority, boldly exhorted his 
audience to rely on the promise of the King, and assured them 
that they would have no peace till the King brought it with 
him.^ 

A few days after this sermon was delivered the hopes of the 
Peace- party were dashed to the ground by Charles's exorbitant 
pretensions. Waller's plot was followed by the imposition of 
the Parliamentary Covenant, and this Covenant was taken by 
Fuller with certain reservations publicly stated. Then came 
the Royalist victories in the West, bringing renewed vigour to 
the friends of peace. On July 26 Fuller preached the most 

used by Fuller about ' truth and peace ' seems to me to bring him rathe?

notewortliy of his sermons, the sermon on Reformation ; ' a 
sermon in which he lifted up a standard round which all 
July 26. who wished to find a tenable position between the 
™ RifoTma- narrowness of Laud and the narrowness of the Pres- 
tion. byterians of the new Assembly might safely rally. 

What the Whigs afterwards were in the political world, Fuller 
was at this time in the ecclesiastical world. All times, he 
urged, were times of reformation, of continual progress, in which 
old errors were swept away and new truths discovered. After 
urging that the supreme authority, whatever that might be, was 
alone to be trusted with the power of reforming the Church, he 
called on all his hearers to fulfil their own duty of reforming 
themselves. After this prelude he struck at the heart of the 
controversy. Beginning with a plea for the maintenance of 
historical continuity, he told his hearers plainly ' that a perfect 
reformation of any Church in this world may be desired, but 
not hoped for.' " Let Xenoplion's Cyrus," he cried, "be king 
in Plato's commonwealth, and bachelors' wives breed maids' 
children in More's Utopia, whilst roses grow in their gardens 
without prickles, as St. Basil held they did before the fall of 
Adam. These fancies are pleasing and plausible, but the per- 
formance thereof unfeasible ; and so is the perfect reformation 
of a Church in this world difficult to be prescribed, and im- 
possible to be practised. For besides that Satan will do his 
best, or rather his worst, to undo it, man in this life is not 
capable of such perfection. . . . I speak not to dishearten men 
from endeavouring a perfect reformation, but to keep them 
from being disheartened when they see the same cannot be 
exactly observed." Those who in the nineteenth century read 
these words of wisdom may almost fancy themselves in the pre- 
sence of Burke denouncing Rousseau. 

Fuller's growing royalism was butthe result of his antagonism 
to the makers of systems, and as the makers of systems had 
His flight it ^ their own way at Westminster, his position soon 
to Oxford, became untenable. He was ordered to take the 
Parliamentary Covenant without reservations. He replied by

p. 258, as corrected at p. 72 1, 



28o LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE. CH. xiv. 

flight to Oxford. The later Solemn League and Covenant did 
not even come into his hands. ' 

Fuller was no more at ease at Oxford than he had been in 
London. He was far too outspoken to avoid giving offence. 
He urges In a sermon preached before the King he spoke of 
to m^kef ' ^^ blessings of an accommodation,' and pressed his 
peace. hcarers to remember that the distractions of the king- 

dom ' could not be better allayed than by a fair condescension 
in matters of Church reformation ' He was happier when, to- 
wards the end of the year, he left Oxford, and followed Hopton 
into the field as chaplain of his army.'' 

" As for any transcendent extraordinary miraculous light, 
peculiarly conferred on our times, the worst I wish the opinion 
Fuller and i^ this — that it wcrc true." In these words Fuller 
thePununs. flung (Jown the gauntlet to the Puritan clergy. He 
had anticipated the sentiment of a later poet : 

' Our little systems have their day ; 

They have their day and cease to be. 

They are but broken lights of Thee, 
And Thou, O Lord, art more than they.' 
From the Presbyterians who crowded the benches in the 
Jerusalem Chamber, to the lay preacher who was the oracle ot 
an obscure Separatist congregation, there were few Puritans 
who did not believe that there was some special plan of doc- 
trine, or some special form of Church government appointed 
by Heaven itself, and certain, if only it could obtain its due 
recognition, to work out the moral and spiritual regeneration 
of mankind. Fuller's reluctance to abandon himself to sec- 
tional aims thrust him into a royalism which was, in many ways, 
uncongenial to him. It is indeed as a thinker rather than as a 
Royalist that Fuller is to be judged. He, and not the Puritans, 
stood on the true line of national progress, though it must also 
be acknowledged that without the Puritan that progress would 
have been impossible, and that the enthusiast, the idealist, and 
even the fanatic, has more part in shaping the destinies of his 
country than the wise forecast of the solitary thinker, who 
knows that life has many sides, but who fails to impress upon

his contemporaries the conclusions of a mind with which they 
are in little sympathy. 

Like Fuller, Chillingworth, in his hatred of dogmatism, had 

been driven to take part with the King. At Oxford he had 

learned that there were other sins as great as those 

worth"ft of violence and rebellion. " Seeing," he declared

crisy, on the other profaneness ; no honesty nor 
justice on the one side, and very little piety on the .other ; on 
the one side horrible oaths, curses, and blasphemies, on the 
other pestilent lies, calumnies, and perjury ; when I see among 
them the pretence of reformation, if not the desire, pursued 
by anti-Christian, Mahometan, devilish means, and among us 
little or no zeal for reformation of what is indeed amiss, little 
or no care to remove the cause of God's anger towards us, by 
just, lawful, and Christian means ; I profess that I cannot 
without trembling consider what is likely to be the event of 
these distractions." ' " How few," he said in another place, 
" of our ladies and gentlewomen do or will understand that 
a voluptuous life is damnable and prohibited unto them ! " ^ 
The men too came in for their share of blame : " They that 
maintain the King's righteous cause with the hazard of their 
lives and fortunes, but by their oaths and curses, by their 
drunkenness and debauchery, by their irreligion and profane- 
ness, fight more powerfully against their party than by all other 
means they do or can fight for it, are not, I fear, very well 
acquainted with any part of the Bible." The London news- 
papers had hardly worse charges to bring than this. 

After such a sermon Oxford was no place for Chillingworth. 
He, like Fuller, took refuge with Hopton, the stout soldier, the 
Chilling- lover of peace, the enemy of all license and irregu- 
Arundei. larity of life. Being with him when he took pos- 
session of Arundel, Chillingworth was left behind stricken

down by sickness in the bitter cold of a winter remark- 
able for the severity of its long frost. With the soldiers 
in the castle during its siege by Waller the great logician's 
relations were not happy. They resented his talk about 
Roman engineering, and fancied him a spy set over them by 
1644. the Queen. When the castle surrendered Chilling- 
is a prisoner worth was too ill to be removed to London. One of 
Chlyniii's" ^^ ministers of the Assembly, Francis Cheynell, 
hands. obtained permission from Waller to take the sick 

man with him to Chichester, where he tended him with all 
possible solicitude till he died.' 

If Cheynell was tender-hearted he was also a controver- 
sialist. He had already, in a book published in May 1643, 
charged Chillingworth with Socinianism ; ^ and the charge, 
which was also brought against Hales and Falkland, was to be 
understood as implying not that he denied the divinity of the 
Saviour, but that he held doctrines which exalted human reason 
above faith and revelation. Sheer compassion for the sufferer 
joined with theological vanity in urging Cheynell to rescue the 
sick man from the pit of destruction into which he had fallen. 
To Cheynell's arguments on the right of Parliament to 
make war against the King Chillingworth replied soberly. The 
soldiers in the Parliamentary army behaved like Christians, 
whereas there was 'little of God or godliness' amongst the 
King's soldiers. There were some arguments which made for 
the Parliament, but after all Parliaments were not infallible, and 
certainly war was ' not the way of Jesus Christ.' In speaking 
of public aifairs, Chillingworth, ill as he was, was still at his 
ease. To more personal enquiries he answered little or nothing. 
When Cheynell asked 'whether he conceived that a man 
living and dying a Turk, Papist, or Socinian could be saved,' 
he answered that he did not absolve them and would not 
condemn them.' It was probably not mere bodily weakness 
which led Chillingworth to shrink from disputation. The 
minds of the two men were moving in different planes of 
thought, and Chillingworth at least could see well enough that

controversy was useless. He pleaded for charitable dealing on 
the ground that he had ever been a charitable man. " Sir," 
replied his interrogator sharply, " it has been confessed that 
you have been excessive with your charity.'' 

The well-intentioned torment grew worse and worse. The 
dying man was pestered with demands for the acknowledgment 
of the covenant of grace. A religious officer of the garrison 
implored Chillingworth to satisfy the world by a declaration of 

his religion. The wearymg interrogations took no 
Jan. 30. (?) hold on him to whom they were addressed. He had 
Chilling. declared his mind in his book, and he would say no 

more. Death at last, probably on January 30,' gave 
him the peace which his kind questioners would not give him 
on earth. 

Controversy pursued Chillingworth to the grave. There 
was a warm dispute between his friends who wished to inter 
„. , , him with honour in the chancel of the Cathedral 

His funeral. 

and his enemies who wished to give him the burial 
of a dog. A middle course was ultimately adopted. It was 
thought fittest to permit his burial in the cloisters 'amongst the 
old shavelings, monks, and priests, of whom he had so good 
an opinion all his life. . . . Free liberty was granted to all the 
malignants of the City to attend the herse.' When the mourn- 
ing followers reached the grave they were startled by the 
apparition of Cheynell carrying in his hands The Religion of 
Protestants. Chillingworth, he said, had once been a Papist, 
and he had not died 'of that faith or religion which is estab- 
lished by law in England.' " He hath," continued Cheynell, 
coming closer to the point, "left that fantasy which he called 
his religion upon record in his subtle book. He was not 
ashamed to print and publish this destructive tenet, 'that there 
is no necessity of Church or Scripture to make men faithful 
men,' in the looth page of that unhappy book, and therefore I 
refuse to bury him myself ; yet let his friends and followers who 
have attended his herse to this Golgotha know that they are per- 
mitted, out of mere humanity, to bury their dead out of our 
Bight. If they please to undertake the burial of his corpse, I

284 LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE. CH. xiv. 

shall undertake to bury his errors which are published in this so 
much admired but unworthy book ; and happy would it be for 
this kingdom if this book and all its fellows could be so buried 
that they might never rise more, unless it were to a confutation ; 
and happy would it have been for the author if he had repented 
of those errors, that they might never rise for his condemnation ; 
happy, thrice happy will he be if his works do not follow hira, 
if they never rise with him nor against him." 

Then, suiting the action to the words, Cheynell cast the 
hated volume into the open grave. " Get thee gone," he cried, 
" thou accursed book, which hast seduced so many precious 
souls ; get thee gone, thou corrupt, rotten book, earth to earth 
and dust to dust ; get thee gone into the place of rottenness, 
that thou mayest rot with the author and see corruption." 

" Let the dead bury their dead," were the closing words of 
this remarkable address, " but go thou and preach the kingdom 
of God." Turning upon his heel, Cheynell ascended the pul- 
pit to warn those who were willing to listen against the errors of 
him whose work he had bitterly condemned. He little knew 
that if his own name was not utterly to perish among men, it 
would be owing to connection with the scholar whom he sen- 
tenced to forgetfulness. In all probability the copy of The 
Religion of Protestants which he flung into the grave was 
picked out by one or other of the mourners almost as soon as 
his back was turned, and was long cherished as a memorial of 
the departed worthy.' 

In modern times no words have been too hard to fling at 
the bigot who harassed a dying man with importunate question- 
ings. The opinion which justifies a lawyer in trou-

the contro- blmg onc sick unto death with questions about the 
^" ^' disposition of his worldly property no longer justifies 

a clergyman in troubling him about his theological opinions. It 
might perhaps have been remembered in Cheynell's favour that 
he pronounced no positive sentence of damnation upon the 
heretic, and that at least in political matters his question, " Do 
you believe that tyranny is God's ordinance ? " went more to 
the root of the matter, was more reasonable in short, than all

Chilliiigworth's appeals to the Biblical texts which he quoted 
in condemnation of rebellion. Still more might it be remem- 
bered that Cheynell was not contending for the mere chips of 
orthodoxy. He saw, and rightly saw, that the contention be^ 
tween him and Chillingworth was one beside which the mere 
struggle of the Civil War shrinks into insignificance. He who 
Wrote ' that there is no necessity of Church and Scripture to 
make men faithful men ' had lodged an appeal to human reason. 
Dimly in the distant future Cheynell descried, behind the bed 
of Chillingworth, the shadowy forms of Voltaire and the Com- 
mune of Paris.

their own self-conceit, and were the authors of a discord which 
marred the harmony which all wise men sought to realise. 
Yet without these despised sectarians no complete solution 
of the problem was possible. Not only was it impossible 
to create a Church so comprehensive as to embrace all 
opinions, but it needed the stirring energy, the robustness of 
faith which is generated by definiteness of aim, to enable men 
to shoulder their way through a crowd careless or contemp- 
tuous of all who separate themselves from their fellows by their

amongst the Baptists, and found expression from time to time 
in petitions and pamphlets, which were far more thorough in 
their claim that liberty of conscience was the right of all men 
than those put foi'ward by the ordinary Separatists. 

If the full doctrine of liberty was a natural result of extreme 
exclusiveness and singularity, where was it more likely to be 
^g found than in the mouth of Roger Williams, who, if 

Roger he was one of the most combative of reasoners, was 

in Massa- also One of the gentlest of men? There was 
certainly no want of exclusiveness in him when he 
flaunted his criticism in the faces of the pious and self-satisfied 
New Englanders, reproving them as being devoid of the graces 
of separation, because, having left their homes beyond the ocean, 
in order that they might separate from a worldly Church, they 
allowed those of their members who visited England to listen 
to a sermon in a parish church, without bringing them under 
ecclesiastical censures on their return. Nor was there any want 
of singularity in his assertion— a serious offence in New Eng- 
land in the days in which Charles and Laud were at the height 
of their power — that the patent on which the government of 
Massachusetts rested was null and void, on the ground that the 
King had no right to give away land which was the property 
Williams at of the Indians. ' Having been banished from Massa-

natives, and in which the man who had known what it was to 
battle unsupported for his solitary opinion announced that, as 
far as legal and material penalties were concerned, absolute 
liberty of conscience was to prevail. 

Few except persons unlikely to be tolerated in more settled 
communities could be expected to avail themselves of the open- 
ing thus provided for the more extreme sectaries.

Standing absolutely alone, Williams was of necessity a 
pleader for liberty of conscience. Before long he found an 
opportunity of upholding his principles on a more resounding 
stage than the New World had as yet to offer. The basis of 
1641. political right in Providence was placed on a volun- 
Confiictin tary compact between the settlers, but in 1641 a 
quarrel arose amongst them which made it necessary 
Wiiiia^ms to seek elsewhere than in their own discordant wills 
in England, j-^^ ^^ means of maintaining peace. In 1643 Wil- 
liams sailed for England to obtain from a pious Parliament the 
authority which he needed,^

Boston.' Williams in this reply reproved Cotton for holding 
'that body-killing, soul-killing, and State-killing doctrine of not 
permitting but persecuting all other consciences and wa,ys of 
worship but his own in the civil State, and so consequently in 
the whole world, if the power of empire thereof were in his 
hand.'^ "Spiritual offences," sSid Williams again, "are only 
liable to a spiritual censure." ' 

Williams, in his preface to The Bloody Tenent, quoted 
Williams with approbation the words of one who can hardly 
quotes Vane, ^aye been other than the younger Vane, who was 
already learning 

* to know 
Both spiritual power and civil, what each means, 
What severs each. ' 

" Mine own ears,'' wrote Williams, " were glad and late wit- 
nesses of an heavenly speech of one of the most eminent of that 
High Assembly of Parliament, . . . ' Why should the labours 
of any be suppressed, if sober, though never so different ? We 
now profess to seek God, we desire to see light.' " 

Between all these seekers after liberty there were points of 
contact, but there were also points of variance. Fuller and 
Chillingworth, charitable from a sense of the fallibility of human 
reason and of the imperfection of human effort, longed for 
peace through mutual concession, and through the acknowledg- 
ment of each man's right within certain very wide limits freely 
to speak his own opinion. They stood on the King's side 
because they feared the dogmatism of the Puritans and the 
tyranny of the Covenant. Williams indeed, as one who was 
but a stranger in the land of his birth, stood aloof from the con- 
troversies which agitated Englishmen ; but Vane at all times, 
and even the Independents of the Assembly, at least after their 
short dream of obtaining toleration from Charles was at an end, 
were the bitterest opponents of all peace with the Royalists, of 
any sort of compromise which would base the Church upon 
anything but a strictly Puritan foundation.

Something was wanted to fill up the deficiencies of either 
side. Men like Fuller and Chillingworth had to learn that with- 
Need of out liberty of sectarian association the edifice of intel- 
«)mpictc lectual toleration which they would fain have reared 
teachirg. would echo with the shouts of the persecutor and the 
cries of the oppressed. Men nke Williams and Vane had to 
learn that liberty stood in need of a wide and more rational 
culture than theirs. That such a lesson should be really learned 
by the many for years to come was absolutely impossible, and 
that any single person should conceive the idea of teaching it 
might well seem to be so improbable as to be all but im- 
possible. 

Nevertheless, the all-but-impossible was achieved by Henry 
Robinson, the author of a tract, which, published in March 
March. 1644, four months before the appearance of The 
liblny of Bloody Tenent, serves as a high-water mark of the 
conscience, controversy on religious liberty in the seventeenth 
century. In Liberty of Conscience, or the sole means to obtain 
Its political pfo-ce and truth, the writer begins by suggesting 
advice. mcans for putting an end to the war which was 
devastating the land. He recommends the disbandment of 
the armies and the demolition of the fortresses. He recom- 
mends Parliament to abandon its intolerable demand for the 
punishment of delinquents, and the King to forego the fulness 
of his claims. He thinks that if the habit of mutual consultation 
were brought back, reconciliation would follow. Mutual consul- 
tation, however, is only possible on one condition. " Because,'' 
lis advice says the author, " I am verily [persuaded that one great 
gbm liberty reasou which moved God to permit these kingdoms 
clndki™ of ^° ^^ ''^"^ divided and engaged in a civil war was the 
peace. general obstinacy and averseness of most men of all 

ranks and qualities in ea;h nation to tolerate and bear with 
tender consciences and different opinions of their brethren, 
unless they were thereunto so far necessitated that without it 
there must inevitably ensue on both sides a total ruin and de- 
struction ; ... in this respect, as also in that I cannot think 
that God suffered so much bloodshed either to establish the 
King's prerogative or the privilege of Parliament only, but that 



1644 AN ANONYMOUS TRACT. 291 

He hath yet a far greater work of His own to bring about, I 
humbly conceive that liberty of conscience may deservedly re- 
quire to be first treated on, what and how far forth it may and 
ought to be permitted ; which being thoroughly debated and 
agreed on by both sides as the first article to be forthwith rati- 
fied by the three estates in Parliament, all the rest will doubtless 
follow more willingly and sweetly." 

One exception only he makes to this sweeping demand. 
The worship of Catholics is to be prohibited as idolatrous, 
Suggested though they are to be freed from all fines and other 
ci?the™' penal consequences of their refusal to join in the 
Catholics, worship of their countrymen. Beyond this there is 
to be no limitation to the complete establishment of liberty. 
Those who made this demand were neither lukewarm nor 
irreligious. They asked to be allowed ' to enjoy that religion 
which they have examined and found the true one, and not be 
subject to a change so often as the civil State or those of the 
highest court shall please to vary.' To the usual objection 
Religious that the toleration of separate congregations would 
norcreate'^ lead to confusion he has a peremptory answer. " I 
confusion, crave leave to ask," he writes, " if it be not a far 
greater confusion both before God and man, and of more dan- 
gerous consequence to the State and their own souls, for a 
thousand men and women of ten several religions or opinions 
to assemble together every Sunday ' in a parish church for fear 
of imprisonment, fines, banishment, and worse, or else that the 
same thousand men and women, being permitted freely, may 
meet in a peaceable manner at ten several places, according to 
their respective differing opinions and religion?" How little 
profit there was in outward conformity was shown by the 
enforced subscription of the Covenant. " Scarce one man in 
a hundred throughout all London but hath subscribed to it. 
I find notwithstanding by discourse that the greatest part of 
the people are httle weaned from the present service-book, 
and wish better to Episcopacy a little reformed, rather than 

' This is one of the many passages which show that the writer was not 
a Puritan of the strictest sort. If he had been, he would have written

Presbyterial or any other church government whatsoever ; but 
for such as hold with Independency, how their stomachs can 
thoroughly digest the Covenant I cannot any ways imagine." 

Still higher is the strain when the author rises to the great 
argument on which Milton was so soon to place the stamp of 
his resounding eloquence. "It is true," he says, 
triM Lt°he " that if liberty be given for men to teach what they 
worst evil, ^jjj^ iHasxQ. will appear more false teachers than ever ; 
yet it were better that many false doctrines were published, 
especially with a good intention and out of weakness only, than 
that one sound truth should be forcibly smothered or wilfully 
concealed, and by the incongruities and absurdities which ac- 
company erroneous and unsound doctrines the truth appears 
still more glorious, and wins others to the love thereof." At 
last we reach the conclusion. " My humblest desires beg leave 
to prostrate themselves in meekness and most submissive 
, manner unto the three estates in Parliament,' that all former 
Acts which countenance persecution for matters of religion may 
Danger of be repealed, and liberty of conscience, which is the 
retaliation, greatest liberty the Gospel brings, restored ; lest 
whilst the prevailing party of Protestants in England think 
it lawful to force other Protestants, because less in number 
and differing from them in opinion, to change religion, God in 
His justice permit Papists to do the like with Protestants in 
Ireland, as well for their sins as their own, to the further desola- 
tion of both kingdoms." ^ 

The word had at last been spoken which alone could heal 
the disorders of the times. Yet no evidence exists that any 
one at that day thought Robinson's arguments even worthy of 

' In an earlier passage the writer says ' that it cannot be for the good 
of King and people that the three estates in Parliament, though arms were 
quite laid down, should stand severally on their negative voices.' The 
three estates must mean King, Lords, and Commons, an error which was 
being widely adopted since the breach with the King.

CHAPTER XV. 

THE COJIMITTEE OF BOTH KINGDOJtS. 

All the current of events was setting against peace. On 
January 19 the first regiments of the Scottish army crossed the

roused that exasperation which is usually so dangerous to the 
offender. On December 26 he butchered to a man

find to be the best way to proceed with these kind of people, for 
mercy to them is cruelty." Unluckily for Byron, the letter in 
which this was written fell into the enemy's hands. '^ 

Newcastle, fully occupied with resistance to the Scots, could 
send no help to Byron. By the recapture of Gainsborough, 
which took place on December 20,' Sir Thomas Fairfax had 

Dec. 29. been liberated to bring help to Brereton. On De- 
ouT/oheTp^ cember 29 he set out. His men were ragged and

their wants out of his own purse, he had hard work to put them

in a condition to march. In the clothing towns of Yorkshire 
he was joined by many of his old soldiers, and he drew other 
reinforcements from Lancashire. Having effected a juncture 
with Brereton, he made for Nantwich, the only town in Che- 
shire which had not yet been lost to the Parliamentary cause 

On January 25' the combined forces fell on Byron's 
besieging army. The thaw which a few days before had been 
so disastrous to Rupert on his retreat from Aylesbury 
Theb.-ittieof had flooded the Weaver, a stream which divided the 
forces of the Royalists, and Fairfax hoped to beat 
them in detail before they were able to unite. The 
ground, however, on which he himself had to advance was cut 
up with hedges, and his progress was so slow that the enemy 
had time to bring together his scattered forces. After some 
sharp fighting a sally of the garrison threw the Royalists into 
confusion. Two of the regiments from Ireland broke and 
fled. The officers retreated into Acton Church, and were forced 
to surrender. The victory was complete, and 72 officers and 
1,500 privates fell into the hands of the conquerors.^ Amongst 
the former was Colonel Monk, who had been arrested by 
Ormond's directions immediately upon his landing at Bristol, as 
one who could not safely be trusted, but had begged his release 
from Rupert, and had been allowed to take service under Byron. 

The defeat of the troops from Ireland must have been hard

most part this-countrymen, are so poisoned by the ill-affected 
people here, that they grow very cold in this service ; and since 
the rebels here call in the Scots, 1 know no reason why the King 
should make any scruple of calling in the Irish, or the Turks if 
they would serve him." " I must renew my suit," he 
" ' ' wrote a week later, " concerning the sending over of 
a considerable number of Irish natives with as much speed as 
may be ; the English — excepting such as are gentlemen — not 
being to be trusted in this war." ' 

The mere talk of sending for native Irish was doing more 
to damage Charles's cause than the arrival of whole regiments 
Irish women could have doHC to support it. In London the 
taken. weekly press played on the popular imagination. 

Fairfax had captured after the battle 120 Irish women, the 
wives or followers of the soldiers. One of the newspapers 
discovered that these women were armed with knives more than 
half a yard long, and it is likely enough that women who fol- 
lowed camps might sometimes need a good blade for purposes 
of self-defence. It was said, however, that there was a hook 
at the end of each knife, which was thus ' made not only to stab, 
but tear the flesh from the very bones.' Therefore the 
wretches were ' to be put to the sword, or tied back to back and 
cast into the sea." ^ Fairfax was more merciful than the scrib- 
blers in London, and allowed the poor women to i-eturn to 
their homes.' 

The London newspapers did but echo the sentiments of 
their readers. " This victory," said one of their writers, " so 
successfully obtained, doth eminently confirm that

1644 CHARLES AND THE IRISH. 297 

We may see how justly God doth avenge the blood of the 
innocent Protestants in Ireland, who are made a prey to the 
rebels and murdered in divers places by the occasion of the 
absence of those who should have defended them, but have now 
like vipers returned to eat out the bowels of their own mother." ' 

If these were the feelings evoked by the mere transporta- 
tion from Ireland of English troops, what would have been the 
passionate detestation which would have stormed 
ing a^inst round Charlcs's head if he had succeeded in carrying 
Byron's wishes into effect, and had landed an army 
of Irish Catholic Celts on English soil ! Yet if he did not do 
this it was certainly not for want of will. Even at the time 
when he was coquetting with Vane and the Independents, he 
was giving a favourable ear to a scheme which, if it had suc- 
ceeded in its entirety, would not only have made peace with his 
opponents hopeless, but would have cost him the hearts of at 
least half of his own followers. 

Nevertheless, unless Charles could set himself to conciliate 
reasonable men of both parties, hardly any policy was open to 
A dangerous him cxcept to appeal to every passion which he 
policy. could enlist on his behalf, hoping that when he had 
trampled down his enemies he would be able through some 
fortunate chance to curb the heterogeneous elements which he 
had aroused. Mischievous as such a policy was, it was pressed 
on him by a little knot of men, to whom, as his manner was, 
he gave ear from time to time. 

The soul of this party, if party it can be called, was Mont- 
rose. For many months he had been urging Charles to 
vigorous action in the north, but his advice had 
Montrase at fallen on closcd ears. The approaching invasion of 
Oxford. ^^ ^co^s, gave him the opportunity which he needed. 
Every Scotsman who had been on friendly terms with the in- 
vaders, or had been lukewarm in resisting them, was now 
November, regarded at Oxford as a public enemy. In N ovember, 
Imprison- Lothian, who had lately returned from a mission to 
Lothian. France on which Charles had sent him, was cast mto 
prison in Bristol Castle, upon his refusal to swear that he would

never bear arms against the King. ' On December 1 6 Hamilton 
and his brother Lanark, arriving at Oxford from Scotland, were 
1644. charged with connivance with the Scottish Presby- 
january. {erians in their resistance. Lanark succeeded in 
making his escape, but Hamilton was sent into close confine- 
ment in Pendennis Castle.^ 

Montrose, backed by Nithsdale and Aboyne, was all the 
while imploring Charles to return to the plan which he had re- 
Montrose's f*^^^^ '^° adopt in the preceding spring. He himself, 
Scottish if only he could be fortified by a royal commission, 
would rally all loyal Scotland to the King, and would 
fall upon the rear of the invading Scots. Antrim, who was again 
at liberty, might bring over 2,000 Irish Celts to attack Argylein 
his own country. His own part of the scheme would not be 
difficult. If Newcastle would lend him a small body of horse, 
he could easily make his way across the Lowlands to those lands 
beyond the Tay where his own estates lay, and where the great 
house of Gordon, represented at Oxford by Aboyne, was the 
bitter enemy of the Covenanting rulers of Scotland. If a party 
of German horse could also be borrowed from the King of 
Denmark, so much the better.^ 

Amongst the Oxford Royalists both Montrose and Antrim 
passed as mere adventurers. Digby, however, gave their scheme 
Digbjr sup- a good word. It was probably in his hands that it

penetrated ' in intima Scotice,'' and reported that the ' aditus, arces, urbes'

Highlands. Wishart gives 10,000 as the number of the men to be sent with

to the Highlands, but to ask them for that complete army of

together with the necessary arms and ammunition and the ships 
required to bring them across the sea. He was also to do his 
best to bribe Monro to abandon his masters by the offer of

Montrose, named Captain-General of all the King's forces in

obedience of the proud Scottish nobles.' 

Charles's difficulties would begin when, if ever, the time 
arrived for putting in execution this marvellous plan. Two days 

after he signed his instructions to Antrim those

doubt that at the time they represented the sentiments of many 
of the Royalist country gentlemen. And it was even now the 
policy of Hyde and Nicholas, and of the sterner adherents of 
the King's cause. Yet it is hardly to be wondered at that 
amidst the miseries of war Culpepper and others should have 
defended the scheme afterwards adopted by Shaftesbury, of 
granting concessions to the Puritans and refusing them to the. 
Catholics. Between the two policies Charles drifted aimlessly. 
By temperament he was inclined to the first, whilst his in- 
terest, real or imaginary, drew him from time to time to take 
measures which would seem to involve the adoption of the 
second. 

Of all this the records of the Oxford Parliament tell us 

nothing. On January 26 both Houses joined in a declaration 

Jan. 26. that the Scots had broken the pacification of 1642, 

^"•'",' .1, and must therefore be treated as invaders.' On the 

against tDe 

Scots. following day they despatched a letter to Essex, en-

''^°''' for the preservation of the religion, laws, and safety 

of°he0xfo°rd of '^'^^ Kingdom.' ^ The letter was signed by forty- 
Pariiament. fgur lords— amongst them the Prince of Wales and 
Prince Rupert, who had recently been created Duke of Cumber- 
land — and by 118 members of the House of Commons. If 
the names of those who were unavoidably absent had been 
added, Charles would have had on his side an array of 82 Peers 
and 175 Commoners. He had therefore on his side the great 
majority of the Peers and about a third of the Lower House. 
Such a body would have been highly effective if Charles had 
been able to use it for conciliatory legislation, which might 
have rallied the lukewarm to his cause. As a medium of 
negotiation with the members at Westminster it was worse than 
useless. Its claim to be a Parliament at once raised 
tion hope- the question whether the Westminster Parliament was 
a Parliament at all. When therefore Essex received*

Answer of was offered to all who would return to their duty and

The first to take advantage of the overture was Sir Edward

gjj. J, King's refusal to dismiss Catholic officers.* He died 

Bering's not long afterwards in straitened circumstances, be-

fore his assessment was completed and his estate re- 
stored.^ From that time a stream of converts began to flow from 
Oxford to London, as in the year before a similar stream flowed 
from London to Oxford. If the deserters were not numerous 
as yet, it must be remembered that it is hard for men when 
sides are once taken in a civil war to abandon their comrades, 
and it may fairly be argued that for every one who left the King 
at this crisis of his fortunes there were at least ten who were 
dissatisfied with his conduct. Charles's attempt to come to 
terms with the Irish Catholics was a more powerful dissolvent 
on the one side than the introduction of a Scottish army was 
likely to prove on the other. 

The Parliamentary leaders, on their part, were more than 
ever disposed to draw a clear line of demarcation between 
those who were Puritans and those who were not. If there was 
to be liberty of conscience at all, they were unanimous in think- 
ing that it must not be granted to the supporters of the Book of 
Common Prayer. On February 5 an ordinance ap-

before, on January 22, Manchester had been empowered by

The agony of Cambridge had been long drawn out. Ever 
since Cromwell had frustrated the attempt made early in the 
Condition of Struggle to convey college plate to the King, heads 
Cambridge. Qf Houses and learned doctors had dragged on a 
precarious existence in their ancient haunts. In the first 
months of the war three of the Heads of Houses had been 
dragged up to London and flung into prison. Those who re- 
mained in the University were subjected to rude and unman- 
nerly treatment. On a cold night in March 1643 — Good 
P'riday was maliciously selected for the purpose — the Vice- 
Chancellor and other chief personages in the University, 
having refused to contribute to the Parliamentary taxation, 
were kept till midnight in the public schools without food or 
firing. The University preacher, proposing to preach, accord- 
ing to custom, a Latin sermon before the opening of term, was 
set upon by the soldiers, and was glad to escape without suffer- 
ing personal violence. The Book of Common Prayer was torn 
to pieces in St. Mary's, in the presence of I^ord Grey of Wark 
and of Cromwell. Colleges were converted into barracks or 
prisons, the dinners swept off the hall tables, and prized col- 
lections of ancient coins carried off for sale at their metalhc 
value. Only partisans indeed were likely to complain that 
college timber was used, avenues of trees cut down, and 
bridges destroyed, for the purpose of fortifying the town against 
the enemy ; but in those days a man was counted a partisan 
who complained that a Parliamentary commissioner busied 
himself with smashing the painted glass in the college chapels, 
that Cromwell ordered the wood carvings in St. Mary's to be

The time was now come for a more sweeping change. 
For some weeks Manchester's chaplains, Good and Ash, were 
The busily engaged in weighing the demerits of the 

ejections. members of the several foundations. All who 
were judged guilty of opposing the proceedings of Parlia- 
ment—and the refusal of the Covenant was held to be a sure 
test of such opposition — were to be summarily ejected. In 
the end twelve Heads of Houses and 181 Fellows or persons 
officially attached to the colleges were sent adrift to shift for 
themselves. The more energetic of them gained a livelihood 
by teaching in schools ; others sought protection in the house- 
holds of the Royalist gentry as long as the Royalist gentry had 
anything to offer. At Queens' College there was a clear sweep. 
Not a single member of the old foundation was left. The 
places of the ejected Heads and Fellows were filled with 
approved Puritans.^ 

The excluded Fellows were treated as Puritans had been 
treated before, and as Catholics had been treated earlier still. 
As long as the State is allowed to decide what religion is to be 
taught, it must begin by laying a heavy hand on the school and 
the college. Laud had understood this, and his Puritan suc- 
cessors were bettering his teaching. Their labour would be in 
vain. In the world of intellect was a current making for liberty, 
and amongst the very men imposed on Cambridge as the 
guardians of Calvinistic verity were some who, like Whichcot 
and Tuckney, were to shine forth as champions of intellectual 
freedom. 

Logical as was the policy of those who bore sway at West- 
Need of a minster, it was only by an energetic prosecution of 
Govern- the wai that it could be carried into effect. For some 
time it was evident that a firmer hand was needed 
at the helm. The strife between Essex and Waller might at any

moment burst again into a flame, and similar disputes might 
easily arise whenever mihtary commanders claimed powers 
ui-feeiirig independent of one another. At this very time 
MLnchLter Parliament was engaged in an attempt to soothe the 
foughty of ^"S''y feelings with which Lord Willoughby of Parham 
Parham. regarded his supersession by Manchester in Lincoln- 
shire, for which, as he alleged, no sufficient authority had been 
given by the Houses. The inferior officers took part with their 
Jan. 22. respective commanders, and on January 22 Crom- 
EtaciTon^ well, in his place in the House of Commons, not 
Willoughby. only charged Willoughby with dereliction of duty in 
abandoning Gainsborough and Lincoln in the summer, but 
with encouraging 'loose and profane commanders,' one of whom 
had even directed a warrant to a constable directing him to 
bring young women to him for the worst of purposes.' Sir 
Christopher Wray, a Lincolnshire gentleman, warmly defended 
Willoughby, and three of Wray's sons inflicted a good cudgelling 
on one of Manchester's officers. Willoughby himself challenged 
Manchester to single combat.^ The quarrel was with some 
difficulty appeased, and Willoughby was induced to return to 
his duty for a time,' in subordination to Manchester. 

On January 30, whilst this unseemly dispute was at its 

height, a motion was made by Crew in the House of Commons 

for the appointment of a small Committee of two or

prepared another ordinance for the appointment of a perma- 
nent Committee of seven Peers and fourteen Commoners to 
join with the Scotch Commissioners, not merely with the view 
(»f reporting their opinions to the Houses, but 'for the belter 
managing the affairs of both nations in the common cause.' 
What was contemplated was to supersede the existing Com- 
mittee of Safety by a body which would be less absolutely 
dependent on Parliament. Thinking apparently that theii 
chief difficulty would be with the Peers, they persuaded Say' to 
P^jj ^ move it on February i in the Upper House. Either 
Theordi- Say took a favourable opportunity when his own 

nance pro- , ■ , ■ • ■ i t i 

posed by fnends were m a majority or the Lords were m an 
adopted by inattentive mood. They at once accepted the 
' "^ ^ ordinance, and, as far as in them lay, empowered the 
new Committee'' 'to order and direct whatsoever doth or may 
concern the managing of the war . . . and whatsoever maj 
concern the peace of his Majesty's dominions.' ' 

In the Commons the new scheme met with violent oppo- 
sition from the Peace-parly, partly as having originated in the 
Feb. 7. other House, but far more as threatening to establish 
A new ordi- executivc Government which might ultimately

first objection was met by the introduction of a new ordinance, 
in which the names were entered by a direct vote of the 
Commons. On the other hand Vane and St. John yielded in 
details. They inserted a provision that the Committee in treat- 
ing with the Scots should only propound what they might 
'receive in charge from both Houses,' and were 'to report 
ihe results to both Houses.' With respect to military 
operations they stood firm. The new Committee was to 
' advise, consult, order, and direct concerning the carrying on 
and managing of the war.' It was to be trusted with negotia- 
tions entered on with foreign States, On the other hand it was

When the new ordinance reached the Upper House the 
Peers opened their eyes to the effect which it would have upon 
Feb. 8. themselves. To the Lords, weak in number and 
Jm!nd-"'^' reputation, the appointment of the new Committee,

could be to the Commons. They would no longer be consulted 
as heretofore on every matter of military detail, and they could 
no longer hope that their wishes would be indirectly taken ac- 
count of. They fought hard on every point on which it was&gt; 
possible to resist, struggling longest on the clause which em- 
Feb i6 powered the Committee to order and direct all mili- 
The Lords tary matters. On February i6 they gave way, and 
the Committee of Both Kingdoms, as it was styled 
came into existence for a limited period of three months, under 
the conditions insisted on by the majority of the Commons.'

fail to be considerable. To the constitutional historian the 
ordinance by which it was appointed is important as contain- 
ing not only the first germ of a political union between England 
and Scotland, but also the first germ of the modern Cabinet 
Germ of the ^ystcm. As far as the English members of the Com- 
Cabiiiet mittec were concerned, it was a body composed of 

system. . , , ^_ . . ■^ , 

members of both Houses, exercising general executive 
powers under responsibility to Parliament, and not merely, like 
the old Committee of Safety, a mere channel to convey infor- 
mation to Parliament and to take its orders. Though it was 
not, like a modern Cabinet, composed of persons of only one 
shade of political opinion, the opinion that the war ought to be 
carried on with vigour was decidedly preponderant in it. The 
opposition of the Lords to the oath of secrecy may be paralleled 
with the insertion into the Act of Settlement in 1 701 of the 
clause which bound Privy Councillors to append their signatures 
to their advice. 

That the Committee thus instituted could never be more; 
than an interesting experiment was the natural result of the fact 
Negotiation 'hat the Parliament from which it sprung had no'

Westminster and at Oxford the war spirit was predominant. 
Yet at Oxford there was at least a show of anxiety to treat.'

war, if only he was not expected to abandon any of his claims.

especially to consider how ' all the members of both Houses ' 
might ' securely meet in a full and free convention of Parlia- 
ment.' 

The formal difficulty which Charles had attempted to evade 
had not been evaded. On March 9 the Houses at Westminster 
refused to treat on the basis of an acknowledgment that

Scots, to be guilty of treason.' There had never 
been much expectation among the Royalists that the proposal to 
negotiate would be accepted. One of Rupert's correspondents 
kept him informed of what was passing. " Not," he added, " that 
I dream of success, but because I would have their shame 
perfect."^ In fact the overtures failed, not merely on the 
formal ground alleged, but because the intellectual basis of 
peace had not been discovered. 

At Oxford, Parliament turned its attention to preparations 

for war. Early in February it authorised Charles to issue

counties subject to Parliament, made all men anxious for peace, 
though they might differ as to the best mode of obtaining it.

Composition by Essex that their eyes were fixed. There at

army. ^g]] Qf g^jj army animated by the strongest Puri- 

tanism seemed likely to be carried out. Manchester's troops, 
it was .said by a London newspaper, would be 15,000 
strong. " Neither," continued the writer, " is his army so for- 
midable in number as exact in discipline ; and that they might 
be all of one mind in religion as of resolution in the field, with 
a severe eye he hath looked into the manners of all those who 
are his officers, and cashiered those whom he found to be in any 
way irregular in their lives or disaffected to the cause. This brave 
army is our violets and primroses, the first-fruits of the spring, 
which the Parliament sends forth this year for the growth of 
our religion and the reimplanting of this kingdom in the garden 
of peace and truth." ' 

With this opinion on the true mode of aiming at peace and 
truth, so different from that of the tract on liberty of conscience, 
Cromwell Cromwcll fuUy sympathised. Utterly intolerant of 
ofthePrayer '^be worship and doctrine which found favour at 
Book. Oxford, his one aim was not to conciliate the foes of 

Puritanism, but to crush them. To him the Book of Common

outworn creed. On Jariuary 10 he had appeared in Ely 
Jan. 10. Cathedral to order a clergyman who persisted in

refused. Cromwell, who was Governor of the Isle of Ely, went 
out, fetched some soldiers, and returned. "Leave off your 
fooling and come down," was the peremptory order, and the 
Ely congregation was driven out in much the same way as the 
Long Parliament was driven out nine years later. ^ 

For a ' choir service ' Cromwell had no tolerance. It was 
sheer Popery, and as such to be suppressed with a strong hand.

the one unpardonable crime in his eyes. With that masterful 
temper which marks the ruler of men, he had shouldered aside 
Lord Willoughby as he was afterwards to shoulder aside mer: 
far more conspicuous. The one characteristic which attracted 
him was zeal in the Puritan cause, and he had too keen an eye, 
too much real earnestness himself, to be satisfied with any 
merely hypocritical semblance of zeal. For the nice questions 
which divided Puritanism he cared nothing. He was pro- 
foundly indifferent as to forms of church government, as 
long as these forms were not used to restrain the zealot, nor 
did he ever interest himself in those disputations about nice 
points of doctrine in which his comrades delighted. Yet, if he 
turned aside from their arguments, he was in full sympathy with 
the arguers, because the practical instinct, which placed him 
intellectually above them, was combined with an enthusiasm, 
sometimes kindling into fanaticism, which drew him to all 
enthusiasts. Thus it was that in him and around him sprung 
Becomes up a new doctrine of toleration, which may be termed 
fi°gh[f"g ^°^ ^ fighting doctrine of toleration. Without the broad 
purposes. intellectual sympathy which made Fullerand Chilling- 
worth tolerant, and not having been personally exposed to the 
scorn and persecution which made Roger Williams tolerant, 
he conceived service to the Puritan cause to be the measure of 
toleration, just as Charles conceived service to the Royalist 
cause to be the measure of that liberty to tender consciences 
which he was perpetually announcing. The difference between 
the two men was that, whilst Charles's doctrine never went 
farther than his lips, Cromwell's rooted itself in his heart. 

It was probably a growing feeling of dissatisfaction with the 
principles of the Presbyterians in the Assembly which led 
Cromwell to defer so long his adhesion to the Covenant. 
During a great part of January he was at Westminster, but the 
Feb. 5. Covenant remained unsigned by him. It was not till 
^^Ttifi' February 5, the day on which the ordinance enforcing 
Covenant, {{jg Coveuant was issued,' that he registered his 
formal acceptance of it, doubtless placing special emphasis

on Vane's saving words, 'according to the Word of God.' 
Something, too, may be due to the fact that he had just

Appointed ^ ^ 

Lieutenant- army — a post which he would not be permitted to 
hold unless he signed the Covenant.' With the 
Covenant in its denunciation of the Church of the Royalists 
Cromwell was in full sympathy. Since his appoint- 
ment he had been actively engaged in the country 
round Newport Pagnell, under orders to secure the safe arrival 
at Warwick of a supply of ammunition on its way to Gloucester, 
March 4. which town was by this time again in distress.^ On 
Hoii?™ March 4 he captured Hillesden House, an advanced 
taken. post of the Oxford Royalists.^ On the loth he 

was at Cambridge, where he found one Lieutenant Packer, 
who had been sent there under arrest by Crawford from 
Buckingham. 

Laurence Crawford was a Scotchman who had served 
under Ormond in Ireland, and who had made his escape to 
England when called on to take an oath expressive 
General of detestation of the Covenant, and to bear arms 
'^ "■ against, his own countrymen in Ulster.'' His military, 
knowledge and his proved fidelity to Puritanism had gained 
him access to the Parliamentary leaders, and he had recently 
received the appointment of Major-General in Manchester's 
army. His Puritanism, however, was of the narrow Scottish 
type, and having discovered that Packer was an Anabaptist, he 
had sent him to Manchester to be examined. Manchester, 
however, was either absent from Cambridge or otherwise 

' We do not know the exact date of Cromwell's appointment, but 
Crawford's commission as Major-General amongst the State Papers is 
dated February I, and it seems probable that Cromwell's commission was 
issued on the same day, or, at all events, not long before or after. 

'^ This has given rise to an unfounded supposition, which was adopted 
by Carlyle, that Cromwell conveyed the ammunition to Gloucester itself.

engaged, and Cromwell sent Packer back to Buckingham with 
a letter to the Major-General. 

" Surely," wrote Cromwell, " you are not well-advised thus 

to turn off one so faithful to the cause, and so able to serve you

incapable to serve the public ? . . . Sir, the State in 
choosing men to serve it, takes no notice of their opinions ; if

have had so many stumbling-blocks in your way. Take heed 
of being sharp, or too easily sharpened by others, against those 
to whom you can object little but that they square not with 
you in every opinion concerning matters of religion." ' 

How to get the best soldiers was the problem which made 
Cromwell tolerant, and tolerance built upon so material a foun- 
dation would to the end have something in it narrower than 
Chillingworth's craving for the full light of truth. Cromwell, 
with all his massive strength, remained always the practical man, 
asking not so much what the thing is as how it can be done.

of the Like the followers of the Laudian reaction, the Sec- 

taries gathered strength from the decline of sympathy 
with Calvinism which set in early in the seventeenth century. To 
cultivated, scholarly minds dislike of Calvin's discipline showed 
itself in a craving for somewhat of intellectual liberty, and for 
a form of worship which had nothing to jar upon their sensitive 
perceptions. To the sturdy peasant or artisan, whose sole litera- 
ture was the Bible, and whose earnest but narrow vision was 
hampered by no traditional interpretations, it was easy to pick 
out passages which lent themselves to well-nigh any interpre- 
tation whatever. Yet it was not the variety of opinion, however 
marked, which was the special characteristic of these enthusiasts. 
It was rather their aim at that ideal perfection which Fuller 
' CarlyU, Letter XX. 



1644 THE SECTARIES. 313 

had wisely declared could never be attained by any earthly 
Church. The nickname of Donatists — taken from those 
African Christian ^ of the fourth century who refused Church 
fellowship to all who had shown the slightest weakness in the 
days of persecution — with which Fuller had attempted to brand 
them was not wholly undeserved. Separatists existed because 
they were resolved to draw round themselves a fence of ortho- 
doxy and holiness which would keep them apart even from 
men of ordinary honesty and righteousness whose spiritual 
attainments were, as they believed, inferior to their own. 
Baptists existed because there were those who could not con- 
ceive that anything short of the strong heartfelt conviction of 
the adult could make him a fit subject of the ordinance which 
was the sign of the Christian profession, whilst Roger Williams 
tore himself asunder from the Baptists because the ideal which 
he followed was too high and glorious to be realised even by 
those who, in the fulness of their years of discretion, had set 
themselves to live a purer and more divine life than that which 
seemed possible to the New England Separatists. 

In the normal condition of society the enthusiast and the 
man of common sense plays each his appointed part. Unless, 
on the one hand, there are those who attempt to shape their 
lives and the lives of others by a standard which never can be 
realised, and which does not perhaps deserve to be exclusively 
realised, stagnation will set in. Unless, on the other hand, 
there are those who apply to such efforts the criticism either of 
practical sense or of the cultivated intellect, the world will 
become the prey of chimeras. In 1644, however, the con- 
dition of society was anything but normal. The uncultured 
enthusiasts suddenly found men to discipline and train them 
who could give them the cohesion which they needed. For a 
time, but only for a time, they would carry all before them ; 
they would strive to mould the nation, of which they became 
the masters, after their own likeness. It would be all in vain. 
The cold tenacious resistance of use and wont would be too 
much for them. The Church of England, with its historic 
memories and its literary culture, was not about to transform 
itself into a congeries of Separatist congregations, any more 



314 THE COMMITTEE OF BOTH KINGDOMS, ch. xv. 

than the well-worn social structure of the realm was about to 
transform itself into an ideal democracy 'fearing God and 
hating covetousness.' 

Yet if the sword of Marston Moor and Naseby was to drop 
from the hands of a disconcerted soldiery on Blackheath, it 
was not in vain that such as these bled and suffered. Salvation 
for a people does not He in that reverence for authority or in 
that distrust of ignorant energy which marked the Royalists, 
nor yet in that respect for the predominance of theological 
learning which was the mark of the Presbyterian. It lies in 
those who, however much they may wander from the path, are 
ready to offer up their lives for that which appears to them to 
be the highest spiritual good for themselves and for the world. 

The time for peace was not yet. The men after Cromwell's 
heart were no lovers of war, but they had come to believe that 
such peace as they would have must be reached through 
victory, and not through .negotiation. They had their own 
sorrows, and they knew well what desolation was spreading 
over England. Scarcely was the ink dry on Cromwell's letter 
to Crawford, when he learned that his eldest surviving son, the 
Oliver who had fought at Edgehill, was dying of 
Cromwell's small-pox in the garrison at Newport Pagnell. The 
^"' young soldier was, as one who seems to have known 

him testified, 'a civil young gentleman, and the joy of his 
father.' ' Such sorrows fell thickly in those years. Cromwell 
had a tender heart, but he turned away from the mourner's 
part, leaving the dead to bury their dead, and — so he seems to 
have read the text — to fight for the kingdom of God. 

' The Parliament Seoul, March 15-22. E. 38, 18. The passage has 
a genuine ring about it, and I am quite incredulous about the story told 
in the Squire Papers, that Cromwell's son was killed in a fight at Knares- 
borough just before Marston Moor. Of all the numerous letters and 
pamphlets, including the oflScial despatches of the Committee of Both 
Kingdoms, which treat of the Marston Moor campaign, not one mentions 
such a fight ; and it is hard to see how it could have taken place without 
notice being taken of it. On the other hand, I have learnt from Mr. Ottley, 
the Vicar of Newport Pagnell, that the name of Oliver Cromwell does not 
occur in th? register of burials, though I hardly think, unless the registers 
weic kept with unusual care, that the fact is of much importance.

the North, or the necessity of striving to the uttermost to recover 
the ground which had been lost at Nantwich. Newcastle, 
fearing to be crushed between the Scots and the Fairfaxes, 
Jan. as. had loudly called for help. Though the younger 
Sfufor"^ Fairfax was still detained in Cheshire, his military 
t&gt;:ip- hold upon the clothing towns of Yorkshire was 

complete. The West Riding, wrote Newcastle, was in the 
hands of Sir Thomas, and the East Riding in the hands of his 
father. Manchester would soon be bringing his new army into 
Yorkshire. To oppose these combined forces he was himself 
able to muster no more than 5,000 foot and 3,000 ill-armed 
horse. All other enterprises in the North must be laid aside 
in order to destroy the Scots. " If your Majesty," he wrote 
on February 16, "beat the Scots, your game is 
absolutely won. . . . For Lancashire and Cheshire, 
if you should think fit, they should lie fallow for a while." ' 

Newcastle may well have been anxious. By this time not

strong garrison to defend the town from which he derived his 
title, had taken the field. His force, however, was but a small 
one, and he had never shown signs of that strategical skill 
which sometimes makes up for deficiency of numbers. His 
military adviser, Lord Eythin, was a methodical commander 
from the school of the Thirty Years' War. 

Wherever it was felt that the services of a methodical 
commander were insufficient, the cry was raised for Rupert. 
Feb. 6. Rupert was already on the way. Some troops he 
otJt'ibr tte^ took with him, but an army adequate to the work 
North. before him was still to be collected. The title of 
President of Wales had lately been conferred on him, and 
Wales was always a good recruiting ground. On the 21st he 
was at Shrewsbury, and before long, gathering men around 
him as best he could, he made his way to Chester.' He was

than a lady's distress. Meldrum and Willoughby were besieg- 
ing Newark, and if Newark fell all possibility of cutting in two

be for ever at an end.

which had been burnt in the siege of 1643, ^"d which lay by 
the river's side outside the gate of the town. Immediately in 
front of Rupert, at the foot of a gentle slope, was a body of 
horse. Perceiving signs of wavering amongst them, he gave 
the word to charge. There was a short resistance, and then 
victory and a chase. The arrival of Rupert's infantry and a 
sally from the garrison of the town rendered Meldrum's position 
hopeless, especially as the men whom he had placed to secure 
his retreat by guarding the bridge over the Trent deserted their 
post and fled to Nottingham. On the following morning

ever, were for the most part derived from scattered garrisons, 
and could not be spared for many days. He had indeed 
gained arms for his new levies, and in Charles's armies arms 
were always harder to come by than men. Gainsborough, too, 
was dismantled and abandoned by the Parliamentary garrison,

and Lincoln, Sleaford, and Crowland were rapidly overpowered. 
Yet what was the gain of a few scattered posts without an army 
to support them? Before long Rupert had returned the 
greater part of his force to the garrisons from which they had 
been taken, and was once more in Wales levying contributions, 
by means of which he hoped to raise an army which he might 
permanently attach to his person.' 

Rupert's diversion at Newark made Newcastle again cla- 
morous for aid. He had found himself unable to maintain 
his ground against the Scots in the neighbourhood 
and the of Sunderland, and, leaving them to complete their 
preparations for the siege of Newcastle, had fallen 
back on Durham. The number of his enemies was ever on 
the increase. " They say," he wrote to Rupert, " Sir Thomas 
March 2 Fairfax is coming into Yorkshire for certain, which 
Newcastle will much disturb his Majesty's affairs here. Could 
Rupert to your Highness march this way, it would, I hope, put 
''''""' a final end to our troubles ; but I dare not urge 
this, but I leave it to your Highness's great wisdom." "I 
thought," he added plaintively in a postscript, "my Lord 
Byron would have followed him close. Your Highness's 
presence would dissolve him." ^ 

Not the will but the power was wanting to Rupert. The 
sense of being overmatched was growing on the Royalists. If 
Rupert's presence in the North brought hope to the King's 
struggling partisans in Yorkshire and Lancashire, it was re- 
garded with despair in the South. Scarcely had he reached

suffered a defeat in Hampshire which was only less than a 
serious disaster. 

In the last week in February the Parliamentary com- 
manders of the Southern forces had held serious consultations 
The Pariia- '" London. The plan of the campaign laid down 
mentapr Combined an attack on the King's position at Oxford, 
campaign in which was to be entrusted to Essex, and an effort to 
reconquer the West, which was to be made by 
Waller. As far as it is possible to judge by events, the latter 
prospect was altogether premature, but there was always a 
temptation on both sides to go beyond military exigencies in 
the acquisition of territory, as every square mile of ground 
gained added something to the financial resources of one side 
and deducted it from the other. This time, however, the 
members of the council of war fixed their immediate hopes on 
a plan which, if it had been conceived by Charles, they would 
have stigmatised as treachery, but which, as coming from them- 
selves, they doubtless regarded as a mere stratagem of war. 
Proposal Basing House was in the custody of Lord Charles 
Basfng*^ Paulet, the brother of the Marquis of Winchester, 
House. ^jjjj jj ^g^g believed in London that Lord Charles 
was prepared to betray his trust.^ Amongst those who took 
part in the council of war was Sir Richard Grenvile, a 
. . younger brother of Sir Bevil. A selfish and un- 

Grenviie. principled man, he had gone through the evil school- 
ing of the Irish War, and, falling into the hands of the Parlia- 
mentarians upon his landing at Liverpool, he had declared 
himself willing to embrace their cause. His military experi- 
ence gained him the appointment of Lieutenant-General of 
Waller's horse and admission to the councils of the Parlia- 
mentary generals. He was not a man to feel at home in an 
atmosphere of Puritanism, and on March 3 he fled to Oxford,

carrying with him the secret of Paulet's treachery and of the 
pkn of campaign for the coming season.' Grenvile's name 
was attached with every injurious epithet ^ to a gallows in 
London, whilst at Oxford he was regarded as a pattern of 
loyalty. Paulet was arrested and sent before a court-martial. 
Eventually, however, he received a pardon from the King, 
who, as may be conjectured, was unwilling to send the brother 
of so staunch a supporter as the Marquis of Winchester to an 
ignominious death.'

It was here that he received the news of Rupert's success

Both Kingdoms not to venture rashly upon an engagement.'^ 
Hopton's army, on the other hand, was in good spirits. The

Waller's officers were dispirited with the result of such 
fighting as there had been. They now knew that in conse- 
quence of Rupert's success at Newark no help from Essex or 
Manchester ^ was to be expected. A council of war decided 
to retreat, and in the dark hours of the night Lisle learnt from 
the sound of rolling wheels that it had already commenced.' 
If, however, the retreat was begun, it was soon countermanded. 
Whatever military prudence might dictate, the advice of the 
council of war was hateful to the sturdy Puritanism which made 
much possible to man by believing all things to be possible 
to God. " Surely," said Captain Birch to Hazlerigg, " we fear 
whether that were God's cause we have in hand ; for did we 
assuredly believe it, when He calls us to fight with His enemies 
we should not run from them ; for man's extremity is God's 
opportunity." * As officer in charge of the outposts, Birch 
took care, by keeping his men in contact with the enemy, to 
make it difficult for the army to draw back. Time was gained, 
and at break of day Waller, who probably repented 
Battle of ' of the pusiUanimous decision of the preceding even- 
ing, took advantage of a thick mist which filled the 
valley to throw a considerable force into Cheriton Wood on 
the higher ground in front of his right wing. Some two hours 
after dawn Lisle, finding himself outflanked, fel back from 
his advanced position, leaving the ridge to be occupied by 
Waller.^

' Hopton's own account of these early raanceuvres, Clarendon MSS, 
1,738 (6), is by far the best, but even this is not clear in all points. 
" The enemy," he says, referring to the morning of the day before the 
battle, " had taken their quarters in a low field adjoining to Lady Stukely's 
house "--i.e. at Hinton Ampner — "not a mile and a half from our 
, army, so as there was but a little hill and a little vale between us." This 
* little hill ' is the ridge on which Waller was subsequently posted , and the

The occupation of Cheriton Wood was not the only act by 
which Waller vindicated his title to be the best ' shifter and 
chooser of the ground ' amongst the commanders of his day.' 
Between him and the Royalist army lay a depression, shallow 
by the wood on his riglit, but broadening out into a wide and 
comparatively deep valley opposite his centre and left. At the 
bottom was an open common, whilst the ridges on both sides 
were covered by enclosed fields. Waller's quick eye saw how 
to utilise the accidents of the locality, and, abandoning the 
usual practice of drawing up cavalry on the wings, placed his 
horse on the common in front of the foot, in order that it 
might be ready to attack the enemy's cavalry if it poured in 
disorder out of the lane which offered its only means of access 
to the open ground.^ 

vale the dip in which most of the fighting took place. " The hill they 
endeavoured to keep because it covered them from us, and gave them the 
advantage of looking into us. We disputed that ground that day with 
little parties and loose skirmishes, but towards the evening we got the top 
of the hill and the view of the enemy's quarters." Then, after describing 
how Lisle was left behind with I,cx30 foot and 500 horse in a little wood, 
which has long since disappeared — unless, indeed, it is a corner of Cheriton 
Wood that is meant— and how the bulk of the army retreated to the higher 
ridge behind, Hopton says that Lisle, ' being so near as he heard them 
span and drive their waggons, conceived they were drawing off.' On this 
Forth made preparations for pursuit. At daybreak Hopton went to Lisle's 
post to see what was going on. " The morning," he continues, " was 
very misty, so as he could not make a clear discovery till the sun was near 
two hours up, and then he found that the enemy was not drawing off, but 
that they had, in the dark of the night, possessed themselves of a high 
woody ground that was on the right hand of their own quarters, and placed 
men and cannon in it that commanded the hill where Sir G. Lisle was ; 
of this he presently advertised the Earl of Brentford," i.e. Forth, who was 
subsequently raised to that title. There is no direct evidence of Lisle's 
retreat, but it would almost necessarily follow, and all the accounts of the 
battle itself which have reached us imply that Waller occupied the ridge 
which Lisle had been placed to guard. I have to thank Mr. Stratton, of 
Chilcombe, for kindly accompanying me over the field, and pointing out 
the sites traditionally connected with the battle.

is no local tradition of any ground known as the Common, but the fencing

i644 BATTLE OF CHERITON. 325 

In spite of his gout Forth had come out from Alresford to 
take the command of the Royalists. He had entrusted the 
left wing to Hopton, who, as soon as he saw the advantage 
which had been gained by Waller, ordered Colonel Appleyard 
to clear Cheriton Wood. After a sharp struggle, Appleyard 
effected his object, and Hopton would gladly have pushed the 
success home by a charge with both horse and foot along the 
ridge on which the bulk of Waller's army lay, especially as it 
was giving signs of being shaken by its failure to, hold the 
wood. Forth, however, always a cautious tactician, shrank 
from the risk involved in Hopton's proposal. It would be 
better, he thought, to allow the enemy the choice between an 
attack at a disadvantage and a retreat, which, as the Royalists 
were in possession of his line of communication with London, 
could hardly fail to end in disaster. If Waller's army were 
ruined, not only would Kent and Sussex lie open to the 
invaders, but Manchester and Essex would perforce be sum- 
moned to the rescue, leaving Rupert time to complete his pre- 
parations for the defence of the North against the Scots. 

Such were the chances which hung upon the fortunes of 
the day. In the Royalist armies generals might scheme aright, 
but victory or defeat depended on the ill-considered zeal of 
some high-spirited ofificer, too untamed to allow military dis- 
cipline to stand in his way when he was burning to strike a 
gallant blow at the rebels he despised. This time it was young 
Sir Henry Bard who, in defiance of orders, galloped down the 
hill into the fatal valley at the head of his regiment. Un- 
supported for a time, he was soon surrounded and his followers 
annihilated ; but his movement had made it impossible for 
Forth to persist in his Fabian tactics, and Sir Edward Stawell 
was despatched to the succour of the impetuous Paladin, too 
late to be of service to his comrades. For a full half-hour 
Stawell fought on. He succeeded in driving back the enemy's 
horse on the common ; but he flung himself in vain upon the 
Parliamentary artillery drawn up behind the hedges on the

was not spoken of in Cheriton at the time of the battle as the Common, it 
was open enough for a Royalist officer to call it by that name.

hillside beyond. His troopers were driven back in utter rout, 
and he was himself left as a wounded prisoner in the enemy's 
hands. 

If Stawell was defeated it was not because he was left 
entirely without support. Other cavalry regiments had been 
ordered down, but the lane which led to the open ground was 
so narrow that the reinforcements arrived slowly, and as soon 
as the Parliamentary horse was again in full possession of the 
common it could fall upon each regiment as it entered and 
overpower it before help came.' Never, by the confession of 
friend and foe, had the Cavaliers fought so vigorously as they 
did under these adverse circumstances,^ and if cowardice was 
shown at all on their side it was only by the soldiers of the 
Queen's Regiment, which was composed mainly of Frenchmen, 
who were without spirit for a fight in which their national 
sympathies were not engaged. For three hours the gallant 
English gentlemen struggled in vain to win the common. Yet, 
if they could not gain the open ground, their foot lining the 
hedges on the northern slope made it impossible for Waller 
to push his advantage home. At last Hazlerigg spied a gap 
between the enemy's horse and foot. Thrusting his troopers 
into the unoccupied space, he gained a position which decided 
the battle. Sullenly the Royalists drew back, leaving their 
best and bravest, amongst them Lord John Stuart, one of 
Lennox's gallant brothers, and Sir John Smith, who had 
snatched the standard from the secretary at Edgehill, dead or 
dying on the ground. 

Forth's spirit rose with adversity. The skill which he had

to the House of Commons (Yonge's Diary, Add. MSS. 18,779, fo'- 87)

decisive. It now appeared that no strategical skill, no splendid 
chivalry, could compensate for the inherent indiscipline of the 
Royalist gentry. At Newbury it had been possible to throw 
the blame on the failure of ammunition. No such excuse 
could be pleaded at Cheriton.

the hands of the War-party at Westminster. That party, led

difficult to obtain purchasers for land which was to be sold 
either to pay off an incumbrance, or to find a portion for a 
daughter, and had therefore every reason to feel sympathy with 
sufferers more hardly bestead than themselves. It was under 
the influence of this feeling that the Scotch Commissioners had 
been able to modify the reply which on March 9 
Germ of the had been sent to Charles's offer to negotiate. As 
Kings de- originally framed the letter had contained a clause 
fixing a time for the King's return to Parliament, 
failing which means were to be taken to provide for the govern- 
ment of the country without him. The clause was withdrawn, 
but it contained the germ of an idea which, as long as Charles 
lived, would never be lost sight of. 

So trenchant a solution of existing difficulties was not likely 
to be widely accepted. Yet Charles was doing his best to make 
Foreign its acceptance possible, not so much by his military 
intrigues. efforts as by the successive blows which his foreign 
intrigues were striking at what remained of the intimate relation- 
ship between King and people. In the winter he had been 
detected in attempting to overpower his subjects by the aid of 
France. When a company of Dutch ambassadors arrived in 
Jan. 12. January to offer mediation, the leaders of the War- 
b^Mdore party must have been much worse informed than 
arrive. jj^gy ugya^Hy ^yere if they had not cause for suspecting 

that the new mediation was intended to be as favourable to the 
Court as that of Harcourt had been. 

In point of fact, Charles had long been angling for effectual 
aid from the Prince of Orange and the States-General. The 
bait which he had to offer was the hand of the youthful Prince 

^g of Wales, which Frederick Henry, and still more his 

Proposed ambitious wife, coveted for their daughter. Some- 
the Prince thing had been said about the matter when Henrietta 
Maria was at the Hague in the spring of 1643, but 
when she met her husband in the summer after the victories of 
Adwalton Moor and Roundway Down, events appeared to have 
taken so favourable a turn in England that foreign aid might 
be dispensed with. A letter written by Jermyn two days after 
the battle of Newbury shows that Charles did not then think

fit to take up the scheme, though he did not wish to cut off 
all expectation of success.' The growing strength of the Par- 
liamentary armies during the winter, together with his disap- 
pointment of any immediate results from Harcourt's mission, 
probably turned Charles's thoughts once more towards a Dutch 
1644. alliance. At all events, on February the 12th, when 
Hop^esheid ^^ ambassadors from the States had been some 
°"'- weeks in London, Jermyn wrote that the King and 

Queen were more favourable to the marriage than the Prince 
of Orange had supposed, and that they only wished to be sure 
that their affairs would be advanced by its means. ^ 

On the ambassadors and their proposals the Parliamentary 
leaders, though probably not in possession of the key of the 
enigma, not unnaturally looked with suspicion.^ When the 
Dutchmen demanded an audience of the Houses they found

So hard was it, in the existing state of feeling, to meet any

there was to be — into their own hands. Under their influence

arguments of a practical or constitutional nature were made to 
do duty in the controversy which arose between the Houses. 
On March 30, Vane had such difficulty in carrying a majority 
with him on what appeared to be a mere question of procedure, 
that the numbers were equally divided, and he only gained his 
point by the Speaker's casting vote.' 

The news from Cheriton, which reached Westminster on 
April I, did much to strengthen Vane's shattered position. 
Day after day fresh messengers brought tidings of 
Waller's Waller's continued prosperity. Within ten days 
after the battle he had occupied Winchester, though 
the castle still held out, had overrun Andover, Salisbury, and 
Christchurch, and was threatening to advance into Dorsetshire. 

The news from Hampshire had very nearly led Charles to 
a resolution which would hardly have failed to prove disastrous.

former it would be easier to escape to France ; from the latter 
the passage was open to Ireland,^ where the Confederate 
Catholics assured her of a hospitable reception, as well as of a 
revenue of 4,000/. a month. Her decision for the time at least 
was in favour of Chester. Yet how to reach Chester now that 
the Roundheads were triumphant, save under Rupert's guidance, 
she hardly knew, and on April 3 Digby, by Charles's 
Rupert ' orders, summoned Rupert to leave his preparations

could not persist in a course so ruinous, and the order given 
on the 3rd was recalled on the 4th.''

mcapacity for the higher work or statesmanship. In 
words which did no more than echo the vague sentiments 
which were so dear to Charles's heart, it begged him to repeat 
once more his assurances of protection to the Protestant re- 
ligion, his promise to convoke a national synod to establish 
the peace of the Church, and to recommend it, whenever the 
time came for it to meet, to have ' a care for the ease of tender 
consciences,' whatever that might mean. A single example of 
actual toleration accorded to some one particular tender con- 
science would have been worth more than the most solemn 
engagement to recommend toleration in the distant future. 
Charles was, moreover, asked to assure his subjects that he

was in case of necessity to be the place of her retreat. The 
farewell which she now took of her husband proved to be the 
last. 

If Charles decided that his wife was not to take refuge in 
Ireland, it was probably because he knew that his relations 
Charles's with Ireland were far more unpopular amongst his 
wkh'ire- °wn supporters than was to be gathered from the 
land. courtly expressions of the address which had just 

been presented to him. He had not hitherto reaped much 
advantage even from the English troops which he had been 
enabled to bring over in consequence of the Irish cessation. 
One body of those troops had thrown down their arms at 
Nantwich. Another body had shared in the defeat at Cheriton. 
It was but a poor compensation for the obloquy which had 
fallen on him that a third body of about 2,000 men was now 
engaged in the siege of Wem, and might possibly be made 
available to swell the numbers of that army which Rupert was 
still engaged in raising. 

Charles's larger scheme of enlisting the Irish Catholics on 

his own side was even less likely to prove a success than his 

scheme for transporting the English army from Ireland. On 

February 23 Antrim arrived at Kilkenny. He was 

Antrim at' instructcd to Urge upon the Supreme Council the 

^°"^' advantage which it would be to them if, without wait- 
ing for concessions from Charles, they at once despatched to his 
aid the 10,000 Irish Celts whom they had offered him a year 
before,' and if they added 2,000 more to serve under Antrim 
himself in the Scottish Highlands, and a supply of muskets 
and gunpowder for Rupert. The reply of the Supreme Council 
was not encouraging. They had no muskets or powder to 
spare, and if they took under consideration the proposed em- 
ployment of 2,000 men in the Highlands, it would be only on 
the understanding that the port at which the men were to 
embark should be entrusted to their own keeping, thus giving 
them a footing on that part of the coast which looks towards 
Scotland, and from which they had hitherto been excluded. 
As for the 10,000 men for England, they must wait to see

Munlter Inchiquin, a descendant of the house of O'Brien, 
WncU- whose Protestantism had kept him firm in his loyalty

troops with credit in the war in the South, arrived at Oxford in 
February to ask for the vacant Presidency of Munster. All 
who knew Ireland thought him eminently qualified for the

Portland. promised it to Portland at the request of Lennox, 
and though it would have been easy enough to make Portland 
understand that in such times private engagements must give 
way before public necessities, Charles insisted on keeping his 
promise, though Portland had never been in Ireland in his 
life, and had never shown that he possessed the qualities of a 
soldier. Inchiquin went back to Ireland a disappointed man, 
ready to use against the King the sword which might have been 
drawn in his cause.' 

If Charles was in danger of losing ground in Munster, his 
hope of gaining strength in Ulster was speedily quenched. 
Early in March Sir Frederick Hamilton brought assurances 
from Scotland that the wants of the Northern army should be

relieved, and before long the English Parliament, terrified at 
the risk which they would incur if the Scots withdrew from 
Ireland, made good the promises of Hamilton. All thought of 
returning to Scotland was at an end.' 

Charles had still to confront the Agents whom the Supreme 
Council had despatched to Oxford to lay its grievances before 
The Irish ^'™' ^^'^ ^ ^'^^^ ^'^ ^^ couclusiou of a permanent 
Agents at peacc. Amongst other demands there were two of 

pre-eminent importance. The Agents asked for com- 
rheirde-"'' plete liberty for the Roman Catholic Church in Ire- 
"*" ^' land and for the complete independence of the Irish 
Parliament. In order to ensure the permanence of the new 
arrangement, official posts were to be fairly divided among his 
Majesty's subjects of both religions, and an Act was to be passed 
authorising the levy of trained bands as in England — that is to 
say, the creation of an army preponderatingly Celtic in origin, 
and Roman Catholic in religion. Only if these requests were 
granted were the 10,000 Celts, for whom Charles was anxiously 
waiting, to be despatched to his aid. " We know not," wrote 
Lord Muskerry, the principal personage among the Irish 
Agents, " how it may be hoped that the nation may subsist in 
the condition of free subjects if our desires be not granted." ^ 

Charles had now to listen to another tale. The Irish Catho- 
lic Agents had been followed to Oxford by agents appointed by 

the little group of Irish Protestants who had remained

Protestants. ^pj.jj jg^ ys&amp;x&amp; Still more uncompromising than those 
of their opponents. Protestantism was to be established and 
Popery suppressed. The existing Parliament at Dublin, from 
which all Catholics had been expelled, was to be recognised 
as alone legitimate. The Confederate Catholics were to be 
deprived of all authority, and the arms and fortresses in their 
possession were to be taken from them. As soon as they were

disarmed they were at their own expense to restore the estates 
of Protestants to the condition in which they had been before 
the war. Poyning's law was to be maintained and a Protestant 
army kept on foot. No one who refused to take the oaths of 
allegiance and supremacy was to sit in the House of Commons.' 

Between the two programmes no compromise was possible. 
On the one side was the harshest and most brutal assertion of 
Compromise Protestant ascendcncy, and of the right of the alien 
impossible, niinority to enslave the children of the soil. On the 
other was a scheme fairer in appearance, fairer, as far as we can 
now judge, in intentions, but leading inevitably to a situation 
in which the Protestants would have been at the mercy of their 
adversaries, and that too in days when the line of religious de- 
marcation rose up as an impenetrable wall of separation between 
the professors of antagonistic creeds. Even Charles, eager as 
he was to secure the 10,000 Celts, could not blind himself to 
the fact that he was asked to place his own co-religionists in 
the hands of a Catholic Parliament and a Catholic army, and 
what he felt hesitatingly and uncertainly was felt with passionate 
Feeling at energy by the mass of his supporters. Their scorn-

which was presented by the Oxford Parliament on the i5th,^ 
and it was the comprehension of this which directed the Queen's 
steps to Exeter and not to Chester on the 1 7th. 

Charles might hesitate long before giving a final answer 
which would cut off all hopes of further military assistance from 
Ireland, but his hope of entering on the new campaign with a 
Charles's reinforcement of 10,000 Irishmen was none the less 
ire?and"u- signally bafHed. A disappointment as great as Charles's 
appointed, awaitcd Montrose. Antrim, indeed, who continued 
to be treated with all courtesy at Kilkenny, had been enrolled 
as a member of the Supreme Council, and had been decorated 
with a high command in the Catholic army, but as yet there 
were no signs of any intention to provide him with the 2,000

whether Antrim effected a diversion in the Western Highlands 
or not. Newcastle, who had all the Scottish army to face, and 
who could ill spare a single man, gave him 100 men mounted 
on worn-out horses and two small pieces of ordnance. Picking 
up a small force of horse and 800 foot in Cumberland and West-

success within his reach. The chief result of them was to create 
an ineradicable distrust of his character, and to bring down upon 
the unhappy Irish, whose fate in those times was not the one 
least deserving of sympathy, the inextinguishable hatred of allEng-

The Parliamentary chiefs had reason to look with hopefulness

and Manchester to rendezvous at Aylesbury on the 19th,' and 
there was every reason to suppose that their combined forces 
would be more than a match for the inferior numbers of which 
the King was able to dispose. Waller's army would thus be 
left free to push on towards the West. 

Yet even before a single regiment was on the march signs 
were not wanting of the existence of the causes which ultimately 

frustrated all these hopes, and showed that the 
failure^ in Parliamentary armies in the South were wanting in

Distrust of Essex was the first to discover that he was distrusted 

by the men who bore sway in the Committee of Both 
Kingdoms. His relations with the Peace-party in the House 
of Lords were too close not to excite suspicion in those who 
believed that any attempt to open negotiations with Charles 
would be disastrous to their cause, and who therefore feared 
lest he might use his military position to impose a ruinous 
peace, as he had been tempted to use it after the defeats of 
Adwalton Moor and Roundway Down. That in this they did

Hi5 con- only was he chained by a stern sense of duty to the 
stancy. exigencies of generalship, but his religion lay on the 

Puritan side of the party-wall which separated the contending 
forces. He now believed as sincerely as Cromwell that the 
peace for which he longed was only to be attained through the 
gate of victory,* though it might reasonably be doubted whether 
his was the arm to achieve the needful end. 

On April 8 Essex presented to the Lords a pathetic and 
dignified remonstrance. The delay in furnishing him with an 
Aprils, army, he said, had cost the country much, and might 
"rancrw" have cost it more. "Newark," he pleaded, "is not 
the Lords, taken, Lincolnshire is lost, Gloucester is unsupplied, 
and the last week " — the week of Cheriton Fight — " there was 
but a step between us and death, and — what is worse — 
slavery." 

" For my part," continued the suspected commander, ■" as I 
first engaged myself in this cause and undertook this service 
with an honest and single heart, without any particular end of 
my own, but merely to serve my country and defend religion 
and liberty, in which cause both Houses of Parliament and the

already, adventure my life for the service of this cause." ' 

Essex concluded by recommending a fresh appeal to the 
City. The simple and manly tone of his complaint was sure 
to go straight to the hearts of Englishmen, and on the 13th 
April 13. the City answered his appeal by a resolution to raise 
o&amp;rs'men ^ Considerable loan upon the usual security of the 
and money, estates of Papists and delinquents, and to send out 
three regiments of trained bands to the rendezvous at Ayles-

if their services were required.^ 

Yet, admirably as the cause of the Parliament was served 
by the devotion of the City, the very necessity of appealing to 
it pointed to a danger even greater than that which would 
result from the mutual jealousy of the commanders. To draw 
upon local resources was to rely upon help which, 
reHanrt on by the vcry nature of the case, could not be per- 
locai forces, j^anently rendered. The local ofificials, zealous 
when war approached their own border?, would grow cool when 
the thunderstorm had drifted away. The local troops, whose 
daily toil was interrupted and whose means of livelihood were 
threatened by long service in the field, would soon cry for a 
speedy return to their homes. As it had been after Newbury, 
so it would be again till the discovery was made that victory 
was only to be attained by a trained and disciplined army, 
which had cast off all local ties and was commanded by officers 
bound to one another by the strictest military subordination. 

Already, when the City took its resolution, there had been 
fresh evidence of the instability of local forces. Waller's

a dash at Warehatn, captured the place, and threatened Poole. 
The City authorities indeed announced that two regiments were 
already on the way to take the place of their returning 
comrades, and that a third would soon follow, but the mischief 
which had been done was only too likely to be done again at 
some equally unseasonable moment.'

would be no negotiation at all.''

case is this : Everybody that is faithful to the King's interests 
apprehends the necessity of a peace,' both for the preservation 
of the Protestants in Ireland and the support of our affairs 
here ; but everybody also is seeking, as the ape did, to pull the 
chestnuts out of the fire with the puppy's foot, and to cast off 
the counsel of granting the Irish anything at all to his neigh- 
bour ; which is the reason why I do not wonder at all that in 
none of your letters I have ever received any opinion from you 
concerning this matter. Only in one thing I shall presume to 
provoke your advice, and that is how you think it may agree 
with his Majesty's interests there and the safety of the Protes- 
tant subjects' condition ? For, to tell you freely my apprehen- 
sion, I do not think the matter likely to proceed to further 
terms of accommodation than so ; not but that everybody 
desires a better settlement in relation to Ireland, but every- 
body is restrained in counsel by apprehensions of the ill effects 
which any concession of the Irish Catholics at this time may 
have upon the affections of the people here." ^ 

When such sentiments as these prevailed — and necessarily 

prevailed — at Oxford, the acceptance of the Irish terms was

Charles appears to have been thoroughly convinced that 
without extraneous aid he could not make head against his 
enemies, and he could not be brought to understand that 
extraneous aid might do him more harm than good. On

Dr. Goffe, who had been chaplain of Lord Goring's regiment in 
the Dutch service, and in that capacity had done much to 
forward the use of the Book of Common Prayer by the English 
soldiers in the Netherlands.' He was now sent as a nego- 
tiator, on the ground that a personage of higher rank might 
raise suspicion. 

His instructions were more than usually indicative of 
Charles's ignorance of the ways of men. The Prince was to

Republic. The three nations were, therefore, to enter into an 
offensive and defensive alliance. Frederick Henry, if France 
should so desire, was to go to war with the Emperor, and to 
give general military assistance to France. He was also — and 
this was the clause which alone possessed direct interest for 
Charles — to furnish fifteen or twenty ships of war for two 
months, and a sufficient number of other vessels to bring over 
to England 4,000 French foot and 2,000 French horse. 
Mazarin, it was true, had hitherto made no promise .to allow 
Charles the benefit of this little army, still less to advance the 
money to pay it. If, then, the French Court should prove 
obdurate, Frederick Henry was at once to give up the French 
alliance and to make a truce with Spain. He was also to send 
over to England the English regiments in his service, to agree 
upon the sum due as an acknowledgment of the wrongdoing 
of the Dutch in the massacre of Amboyna, and to pay his 
daughter's portion in ready money. '^

to adopt -another merely for the pleasure of seeing his daughter 
married to the Prince of Wales. As might have been expected, 
the Prince replied that he should be glad to see a good under-

would have nothing to do with Spain. '

position as to keep the communications of the city 
open, at least on one side. If they separated, the Royal army 
was strong enough to fall upon each of them alternately with 
every prospect of success.' The plan was rather a modification 
of Rupert's scheme than an original conception. Rupert had 
proposed that Charles, with all his force, should guard a large 
circle of fortifications round Oxford, whilst he was himself set 
free to strike at the enemy at a distance. According to the 
new plan a small force only would be left at Oxford, whilst 
Charles, with at least a part of his army, would be as free as 
Rupert. It is probable that the modification was due to Forth. 
At least his creation as Earl of Brentford in the English 
peerage on the very day on which the council of war was held 
goes far to show that his influence was at this time in the 
ascendant. 

Whoever was the author of the plan, it marks a change in 
Charles's strategy corresponding with the change in his military

outflank and to crush the enemy by the weight of superior 
numbers. In 1644 he knew his forces to be numerically 
inferior, and he fell back upon the idea of compensating for 
that inferiority by rapidity of movement from his central 
position at Oxford. 

It is not sufficient for a general to form a good plan. It 
is also necessary for his success that his opponents should 
commit blunders, and Charles had not long to wait to see the 
blunder on which he had counted committed before his eyes. 
May 28. On the 28th Essex crossed the Thames at Sandford, 
^eTsm"'^ and took up his quarters at Islip, leaving Waller to 
and Waller, operate independently on the Berkshire side. The 
separation of the two armies was not yet complete, but there 
was an evident tendency to separate.

During three days Essex strove in vain to seize the bridges 
over the Cherwell at Gosford and Enslow. On June 2 the

It seemed at last likely that military events would take a 
decisive turn. On the very day on which the ambassadors

Would it not be the best course, suggested someone, to sur- 
render on conditions ? "I may be found in the hands of the 
Earl of Essex,'' was the King's reply, "but I shall be dead 
first." ^ 

In all haste Charles withdrew to Oxford, but there at least 
it was impossible to remain. If his whole army were blocked

learned that Tewkesbury had surrendered to Massey ; that 
Denbigh, who for some months had been holding his own at 
the head of a small force in Shropshire and Staffordshire, was 
advancing southwards ; and that Essex and Waller were on the 
march. To make for Bristol would be to hazard a battle, and 
a battle was the very thing which Charles most wished for the 
present to avoid. He therefore pushed on for Worcester, 
June 6 where he took up his quarters on the 6th. The 
Charles at prospect before him was not a bright one. " When 
I have told your Highness this," wrote Digby to

that Oxford is scarcely victualled for a month, and for aught 
we know blocked up in a manner by the enemy's horse, your 
Highness will easily frame to yourself an image of our con-

task ought to devolve. Not only was Essex farther from the 
King and nearer Lyme than Waller, but his army was more 
homogeneous, as being composed of men enlisted for general 
service, whilst that of Waller was mainly composed of men who 
had been furnished by the Association of Kent, Sussex, and 
Surrey, and who were therefore likely to be unwilling to be 
long absent from their homes. 

In truth this extraordinary diversion of half the army from 
its proper work was but part of a preconceived plan. It was 
Essex no mere relief of an heroic but unimportant garrison 

m^rchlnto which was Contemplated. Essex, always prone to 
the West. f^u under the influence of those around him, had 
fallen under the influence of Lord Robartes and the gentlemen 
of Devon and Cornwall. He fancied that if, after relieving 
Lyme, he pushed on into the West, he should not only occupy 
a province which Waller had long regarded as his own, but 
should, by cutting off one main source of Charles's supplies, 
do more to bring the war to an end than if he had defeated 
the King in a pitched battle. ' 

It is evident that Essex altogether underestimated Charles's 
resources. Waller, he thought, had no more to do than to 
drive the King before him, and then to turn back to the dull 
Waller's work of besieging Oxford. Waller, at least, knew 
opinion. better than this. The chase after the King's person 
appeared to him to be an endless task, yet one which, endless 
as it was, must necessarily be faced. As long as Charles was 
at large there would be no end to the war, ' for, break his army 
never so often, his person will raise another.' ^

alleged, after disposing of the King, would be in a good position 
for turning back to undertake the siege of Oxford with the 
assistance of the reinforcements which might reasonably be 
expected to join him. " Pardon me," continued the aggrieved 
commander, "if I make bold to order and direct my own 
Major-General,' for in truth I do not see how Sir William 
Waller can take care of all the countries along the seaside from 
Dover to St. Michael's Mount. If you think fit to set him at 
liberty and confine me, be pleased to make him General and 
me the Major-General ^ of some brigade, that my soldiers may 
have free quarter, free plunder, and contributions besides, as 
his have without control. Finally, that army which hath the 
greatest strength of foot will be most able, by God's blessing, 
to reduce the West, and I believe that I have the most resolute 
foot in Christendom. Take heed how you disaffect them, for 
if you lose them either by commanding me ^ to be still or 
putting them upon ordinary services which are below them, 
you will repent too late, and I too soon. If you encourage 
me to advance further into the West, I hope in a reasonable 
time to relieve Lyme and distress Weymouth ; but if you call 
back Sir William Waller from pursuing the King and stop me 
in my march to the West, we are like to lose the benefit of 
both armies this summer, because we are put upon cross 
services, which lie far out of our way, and are denied the 
benefit of those fair opportunities which God hath put into 
our hands. Consider what I have said, and if by following 
your advice the West be not reduced, Hopton's army be re- 
cruited, and Lyme lost, let not the blame be laid upon- your

which was lying on the lower slopes of the hills. Behind the 
slender line of fortification, over which an active man could 
without difficulty leap, the townsmen held sturdily out ; all the 
more resolutely as amongst the scanty military garrison was the 
Colonel Blake who was afterwards the indomitable Admiral of 
the Commonwealth and Protectorate.' After every effort to 
storm the place had failed, Maurice had recourse to one 
desperate expedient. He poured a shower of red-hot iron 
upon the town in the hope of lighting up a conflagration 
which would render defence impossible. Maurice was, how- 
ever, disappointed, and the fires which he raised were ex- 
tinguished almost as soon as they were kindled. Lyme was 
at last delivered by the approach of Essex. At two o'clock in

almost to pieces by the women of Lyme.' ^

been pointed out by a writer in the Saturday Review, of Blake's holding

my presence in any associated county, which is wholly com- 
mitted to the care and trust of some inferior commander." ' 

Essex here appears at his worst. There are no signs in 

any of his letters that his mind embraced the campaign as a 

whole. He had reasons to give, which were at least 

Essex as a worthy of Consideration, why, if he could possess 

comman er. jjjjjjggjf gf jj^g West, the royal cause would receive a 

heavy blow by the loss of the contributions of those regions ; 
but he never asked whether, as things stood elsewhere, he was 
capable of possessing himself of the West. It was, in fact, his 
own incapacity to act as a commander-in-chief which almost 
justified the Houses and their Committee in refusing to treat 
him as such. Their mode of dealing with the difficulty was 
indeed as fatal as his own. Though Essex and Manchester, 
Cromwell and Waller, were all members of the Committee of 
Both Kingdoms, it was seldom that any of them were able 
to take part in its deliberations. Its acting members were 
civilians, and civilians are necessarily incapable of wisely 
directing the movements of armies. Their own instructions to 
Essex had been vague and uncertain, and in distrust of the 
General they had divided his authority amongst officers 
nominally under his command, whilst they did not venture to 
remove him from his post, inefficient as he was, because he 
had a large following amongst the officers, and because he 
was regarded with affectioa by that numerous body in the two 
Houses which hoped against hope that he would one day

i644 CHARLES TURNS BACK. 359 

It was only gradually that the Parliamentary commanders 
would learn that neither the besieging of towns nor the occu- 
pation of territory would end the war so long as the enemy was 
unbeaten in the field. The Royalist commanders had already 

June ^3. discerned the truth, and, when once the separation

Bewdiey. agitated amongst them was whether the King should 
march northwards to assist Rupert in beating Manchester and 
the Scots, or should carry out his original plan of falling alter- 
nately upon Essex and Waller. Local considerations, derived 
from the positions of the armies, decided Charles in favour of 

- the latter plan, and on Tune 14 he made up his

Charies mind, though personally inclined to despondency, to 
return to hurry back to Oxford in order to collect reinforce- 
" °^ ' ments which would enable him to fight Waller with 
advantage.' 

The Royal army was better horsed than that of Waller, 
and could easily outmarch its opponents. On June 21 it 

reached Woodstock, where, after a junction with 
Charles at such troops as could be spared from Oxford, it 

numbered 5,500 foot and 4,000 horse, the cavalry 
being more than six times as numerous as was usual in othei 
armies of the time.^ That evening Charles pushed on foi

for him to act. Waller was close at his heels, and without 
fighting it was impossible to shake him off.' 

Great was the alarm in London when it was known that 

the King was at Buckingham. Everything possible was done 

to send help to Waller. Maior-General Bilowne, 

June 23. ^ ■' 

Preparations who, as the Royalists were never tired of remmding 
him, had formerly been a woodmonger, had for 
oSerLi some time been slowly gathering a force which, in 
Browne. conjunction with that of Waller, was intended to 
conduct that siege of Oxford which Essex had refused to 
undertake. As a soldier, Browne had done good service in 
the winter campaign in Hampshire and Sussex, and had con- 
tributed largely to the victory of Cheriton. On the 23rd he 
, was ordered to march to protect the country between 

to march Londou and the Royal army. Yet the force under 
his command was far too scanty to be of much 
service, and the Committees of Herts, Essex, Suffolk, and 
Norfolk were urged to send their trained bands to assist him 
in guarding the threatened districts. In this way it was 
calculated that Browne would have about 3,000 men under his 
orders. There was, however, not a single horseman amongst 
them, and, in those days, it was impossible for infantry to 
march safely without a convoy of horse over the open country 
beyond St. Albans. To overcome this difficulty Colonel 
Norton, who commanded a body of cavalry attached to a 
Hampshire force, then occupied in besieging Basing House, 
was instructed to place himself temporarily at Browne's dis- 
posal.^ 

All the faults which characterised Waller's army reappeared 
in a far more glaring manner in that of Browne. His little 
Browne's fo^ce would be composcd of troops derived from six 
difficulties, different sources, each distinct body regarding the 
others with a jealous eye, and each depending for its pay upon 
a separate local Committee, which might at any time see fit to 
recall its own men to service nearer home. Nor was the

military instinct likely to be strong in men immersed in the 
ordinary avocations of life, and called away to undertake a 
hard service for which they had neither special aptitude nor 
special training. 

In spite of the risk he was running, Browne set out on his 
mission. On the 25th he was at Barnet. On the following 
day he reviewed his three London regiments, which 
Browne at numbered in all no more than 500 men. When 
he reached St. Albans he found the Hertfordshire 
Committee hard to move. Who, they asked, was to pay their 
soldiers ? In any case, they added, trained bands were not 
bound to overstep the limits of their county. On the 28th 
Browne, finding that he could make no impression on the 
Committee, took the matter into his own hands, and issued 
warrants ordering the men of Herts and Essex to meet him at 
Dunstable. In the face of his resolution the Committees of 
the two counties submitted. In a day or two he found him- 
self at the head of about 4,000 men, a larger number than he 
had himself expected. The City regiments now amounted to 
1,000, and three Essex and two Hertfordshire regiments made 
up the remainder of the force. From Suffolk and Norfolk 
not a single man had yet arrived.' 

It might have gone hard with Browne if the King had 

been in a condition to attack him. Fortunately for his raw 

troops, Waller had hurried back to his aid, and Charles had 

faced about to meet his old antagonist. During the whole of 

June 28. ^^ ^^'•^ ^^ King, with Brentford at his side, was

of enticing Waller to leave the strong position which he had 

taken up.^

western. Waller was anxious to fight if he could do it with 
advantage to himself. "This day," he had written on the 
morning of the 28th, when the two armies first faced one 
another at Banbury, " in all likelihood will prove a deciding 
day ; the Lord prosper His own cause for His great name's 
sake." On the 29th he was full of hope that the time was 

come. Seizing Cropredy Bridge, he watched the 
Cropredy enemy marching past. Suddenly Charles's vanguard 
" ^°' and main force hastened their steps on the news 
that a Parliamentary force of 300 horse was in front, and might 
be cut off before Waller could come to the rescue. Charles, 
however, had omitted to inform his rearguard of his intentions, 
and there was soon a considerable space between that part of 
his army and the rest. Waller at once seized the opportunity. 
Sending Lieutenant-General Middleton, the Scotch officer who, 
with Montrose, had forced the Bridge of Dee, across a ford 
about a mile lower down the river, he himself pushed over 
Cropredy Bridge to cut off the loiterers. For a while every- 
thing went well with him, and the King's rearguard was almost 
reduced to the necessity of surrender. In the meanwhile, 
however, the main body of the Royalists had hastened back to 
the relief of their comrades, and a sudden charge made by the 
Earl of Cleveland, and supported by Lord Bernard Stewart, 
changed the fortune of the day. Middleton was routed, and 
ultimately, after a second onslaught, in which Wilmot took 
part with Cleveland, Waller's park of artillery was captured. 
The Parliamentary General drew back to his own side of the 
little river, and though he firmly held the bridge the Royalists 
succeeded in crossing at the ford. By this time the bulk of 
Waller's army was drawn up on a rising ground above the 

western side of the valley, and Charles lost hope of 
offers to making much impression upon it. With that strange 
^'^ ' belief in the readiness of his opponents to accept his 

terms, if only he could be allowed to state them in their 
hearing, which never left him, he sent a trumpeter to Waller 
asking him to receive a message of peace. Waller, like Essex 
before Oxford, answered that he had no power to treat.' 

' Walker, 31-33. Symonds' Diary, 22. 



'644 CHARLES AA'D WALLER. 363 

Once more Charles had thrown away a great opportunity 
by hesitation in the execution of a well-laid plan. Yet so 
superior was the composition of his army to that of Waller, and 
so hopelessly were the councils of the Parliamentary Generals 
in the South divided, that, unless disastrous news arrived from 
the North, the Royal army could hardly fail to get the upper 
hand in the regions in which Charles himself was fighting.

CHAPTER XVIII. 

MARSTON MOOR. 

For more than six weeks before the fight at Cropredy Bridge 
Rupert had been hewing his way through foemen, with the 
deliverance of York ever in view. Yet when, on May i6, he 
1644. set out from Shrewsbury, it was not towards York 
Rupert ' that the tramp of his horsemen was directed. He 
Shrewsbury, had to seck rccruits for his not too numerous army, 
and the deliverance of Lathom House, bringing with it the 
restoration of the authority of the Earl of Derby in Lancashire, 
was the likeliest means of effecting that object. Nor could 
the enterprise itself fail to touch the heart of a commander far 
less chivalrous than Rupert. For three months the 
of Lathom Countcss had held out, as Lady Blanche Arundel 
°"^^' had held out at Wardour Castle, and as Lady 
Harley had held out at Brampton Bryan. . The worthy 
daughter of the House of La Tremouille had flung defiance 
at Fairfax fresh from the victory of Nantwich. "Though a 
woman and a stranger," she replied to his summons, " divorced 
from my friends and robbed of my estate, I am ready to 
receive your utmost violence, trusting in God for protection 
and deliverance." To Rigby, the Puritan lawyer, who suc- 
ceeded to the command of the besiegers when Fairfax was 
called away to Yorkshire, she replied in haughtier terms. 
" Tell that insolent rebel," she answered, after musket and 
cannon had been doing their worst, "he shall neither have 
persons, goods, nor house. When our strength and provision 
is spent, we shall find a fire more merciful than Rigby." Lady 
Derby was not yet at that extremity. She sent out a party, 
which seized and carried off in triumph a huge mortar which

had worked the greatest mischief. The puzzled besiegers drew 
back and changed the siege into a blockade. The news that 
Rupert was on the way struck them with alarm. Covering

their fears with bravado, they once more summoned the 
Countess to submit to the mercy of Parliament. As the 
messenger was reading the summons the lady broke in with a 
correction, telling him that he should have said ' the cruelty of

Rupert was indeed on the way. On the 25th he seized on 
Stockport, and delivered the place over to plunder. Avoiding 
Mayas Manchester, in which was a strong Parliamentary 
Stockport garrison, he made for Bolton, where he fell upon 
Rigby and the force which had been drawn hastily 
Bolton ° " off from before Lathom House. On the 28th, with 
s orme . Lord Derby riding by his side, he stormed the town. 
Sixteen hundred of the enemy were cut down on the spot, and 
seven hundred carried off as prisoners. The massacre was, as 
The Stan- usual, followed by a sack of the houses of inoffensive

House. Lathom to present to the Countess of Derby the 
twenty-two standards which had lately waved over the heads of 
her besiegers.^

Rupert's track had been marked more than was customary 
in that sad war by blood and desolation. No wonder alarm 
was felt both at Westminster and in the leaguer before York 

at his conquering progress. On June 3 the Com-

the Generals of the armies before York to send 
Manchester and Fairfax into Lancashire to nip the mischief in

That Vane should have been sent in person on a mission 
which would have been better entrusted to a soldier raises a 
suspicion that more was intended than meets the eye. In 
truth, Vane came from London to York, not to 
secret instruct Leven, Fairfax, and Manchester how to

vision for the government of England which would exclude 
Charles from all authority. Vane and his immediate

Charles on the throne. The attempt made by them in March 
to procure a recognition of this doctrine had failed through the 
resistance of the Scottish Commissioners, ' and that resistance 
was still stubborn. Vane, however, appears to have imagined 
that an idea which had shocked politicians might be accepted 
by practical soldiers, In this, however, he was bitterly disap-

and the Scots seem to have taken the lead, whilst, though no 
actual evidence exists on the subject, it is in the highest degree 
probable that Cromwell was won over to Vane's side, and that 
his quarrel with the Scots and with Manchester, as the sup- 
porter of the Scots, dates from these discussions outside the 
walls of York. ^

^ Agostini in his despatch of June ^ {^Ven. Transcripts, R.O.) sajrs 
that the true end of his mission was ' di persuader i Capi di quell' armata

On j'^°^' Agostini further states that Vane, finding opposition in the camp 
before York, had gone on in the greatest secrecy to Scotland to get a more 
favourable answer. On g^pff Sabran, the new French Resident [R.O. 
Transcripts) writes that Holland had called on him two days before, and 
had told him : ' Que le S'. Vanne, le fils, lequel fut envoy^ vers les

The controversy as to the possibility of making peace with 
Charles which had long been smouldering in Parliament had 
Nature of thus been transferred to the camp. All subsequent 
the dispute, experience, indeed, went to show that Vane and 
Cromwell were in the right in coming to the conclusion that 
it was impossible to expect any reasonable security for the 
maintenance of Puritanism if Charles were re-established on 
the throne. Yet the very horror with which men of ordinary 
capacity, like Manchester and the elder Fairfax, regarded any 
meddling with the occupancy of the throne might have served 
as a warning of the enormous difficulties in the way of those 
who should attempt permanently to settle the government on a

Towards the end Sabran appears to slip off from what the Generals 
were reported to have said to what Holland said. The earlier part, how- 
ever, coincides fairly with Agostini's statement. The evidence is in itself 
not conclusive, as it may have been derived from one of those circum- 
stantial stories which usually float about when party feeling runs high. 
What is strongly in favour of its substantial truth is that it fits in admirably 
with all else that is known. It explains the tone of Cromwell's letter 
written to Walton after Marston Moor, as well as his dislike of the 
Scots, which now becomes noticeable. It explains, too, how it was that 
Manchester, who for some time was under Cromwell's influence, came to 
pass under that of Crawford. That Vane proposed to transfer the crown 
to the Prince of Wales is said in a letter from Sabran to Mazarin. Arch,

revolutionary basis. The England of that day could neither 
be governed by Charles I. nor without a king, and the 
dread which was entertained of any attempt to dispense with 
Charles was in reality the expression of a widely felt belief that 
security for property and life would disappear with the over- 
throw of the throne. Vane and Cromwell were right in their 
judgment of Charles, but Manchester and Fairfax had a firmer 
hold on the possibilities of that future which would arise as 
ioon as Charles was in his coffin. 

For the present, however, the business of the Generals was 
to take York ; not to settle how England was to be governed.

out to inform Rupert that York could only hold out for six 
days longer.' 

It was the object of the Parliamentary commanders to 
enter York, if possible, before the six days elapsed. For some 
time a mine had been in progress which was ex-

come into collision with Cromwell. Anxious in his vanity to 
secure the credit of the capture of the city, Crawford fired the 
mine on the 17th without giving notice either to Leven or 
Fairfax. Manchester's troops, having been warned, gallantly 
rushed at the breach, but they were promptly overpowered 
and driven out, in consequence of the enforced failure of 
the other two commanders to second them by assaults on 
the sides of the fortifications opposite to their respective 
quarters. 

A delay of some days was thus secured by the garrison. 
Rupert might surely be expected to hasten to its succour ; and 
if he had needed a spur, he would have found it in a letter

June 14. to Oxford which led to the fight at Cropredy Bridge, 
feuefto^^ "Now," wrote Charles, "I must give you the true

as enforces me to give you more peremptory commands 
than I would willingly do, you must not take it ill. If 
York be lost I shall esteem my crown little less, unless supported 
by your sudden march to me, and a miraculous conquest in 
the South, before the effects of the Northern power can be

themselves from the besiegers, or that for want of powder you 
cannot undertake that work, that you immediately march with 
your whole strength directly to Worcester, to assist me and my 
army, without which, or your having relieved York by beating 
the Scots, all the successes you can afterwards have most in- 
fallibly will be useless to me." ' 

Whatever may have been the precise meaning of these 
painfully involved sentences, there could be no doubt what 
interpretation would be put upon them by Rupert.

Rupert had completed his preparations and was actually on 

the move. On the 28th tidings arrived that he had 

Thecomiig crosscd the range of hills which divides Yorkshire 

"pert. f^Q^ Lancashire. On the 30th it was known that 
he had reached Knaresborough,' and was therefore about 
twelve miles from York. The Generals had already summoned 
Denbigh and Meldrum to their aid, but neither Denbigh nor 
Meldrum would be at Wakefield before July 3, and unless 
reinforcements arrived it would be ruinous to be caught between 
Rupert's army and Newcastle's garrison, as Meldrum had been 
caught in March at Newark, and as Waller in the preceding 
summer had been caught at Devizes. On the 
The siege' moming of July I, therefore, the whole besieging 

'^" "'"' force marched off towards Marston Moor, on the 
road to Knaresborough, hoping to bar the way to York. Its 
leaders had learnt the lesson that it was useless to besiege a 
fortified town with an enemy unbeaten in the field.^ 

The tactics of the Parliamentary Generals were simple — 
too simple to baulk Rupert of his design. Sweeping round to 
Rupert's. the left by Boroughbridge, and crossing the Swale 
manoeuvres, ^j "phomton Bridge, he wheeled sharply to the right, 
and, driving off a guard placed by Manchester over the 
bridge of boats which had been thrown over the Ouse at the 
commencement of the siege, crossed that river into a place of 
safety. Halting for the night outside York, on its northern 
side, he sent orders to Newcastle to come out and meet him 
on the following morning. 

While Newcastle was pondering over this message the 
Resolution Parliamentary Generals were holding serious de- 
of the Par- bate on Marston Moor. York was lost, and the

to Marston back, and by two in the afternoon had established 

itself amidst the rye which waved on the summit of 

the ridge. Some attempt was made by a party of Royalists, 

probably under Lord Byron,^ to win ground on the extreme

was repulsed and the assailants driven back upon the moor.^

^ Byron is said in the so-called Rupert's Diary to have begun the 
actual battle. As this is not countenanced by any other authority, it is 
not unlikely that he really took part in this preliminary skirmish. The 
account given in the text receives further corroboration from 'News sent 
from Mr. Ogden,' copied for me by General Wrottesley from Lord 
Wrottesley's MSS. after my narrative had been printed. " They," the 
Parliamentarians, writes Ogden, " set on the Prince towards night, when 
they were least looked for."

liad broken into mutiny, crying aloud for pay. When the two

Meeting of t t &gt;! • i i n. • 

Rupeitaud "My Lord, said the Pnnce, as soon as the first 
compliments had been exchanged, " I hope we shall 
have a glorious day.'' Newcastle replied that it would be 
better not to fight at all. The enemies' commanders were on 
bad terms with one another, and their army would break up 
before long. Reinforcements under Clavering were already 
on their way from the North. It may be that Newcastle was 
wounded by Rupert's abrupt manner, but there was nothing in 
the military antecedents of the courtly Marquis to lead Rupert 
to treat him with respect. He had frittered away great oppor- 
tunities before, and he seemed bent on frittering them away 
again. The fiery young Prince cut him short by announcing 
that he had a letter from the King ' with a positive and abso- 
lute command to fight the enemy.'' Before this announce- 
ment Newcastle withdrew all objections. " Happen what 
will," he said to his friends, who told him it was unworthy of 
him to be commanded by Rupert, " I will not shun to fight, 
for I have no other ambition but to live and die a loyal subject 
to his Majesty." ' 

No doubt the King's letter was not so plain of interpre- 
tation as Rupert asserted, but it does not follow that Rupert 
was obviously in the wrong in calling for a battle. He had_ 
never yet met the horsemen whom he had not scattered, and, 
as the events of that evening were to prove, if he had personally 
been as successful on Marston Moor as he had been on every 
field stricken since the war began, the victory would have been 
won along the whole line, and there can be no serious doubt 
that that victory would have given to Charles once more an 
undisputed throne. As for Newcastle's projected war of 
manoeuvre, it was at least as likely to turn against him as in his 
favour.

infantry behind those led by Lord I'airfax in person. On the 
left was Manchester's army of the Eastern Association, the 
infantry being commanded by Crawford, and the cavalry, 
supported by some Scottish dragoons and by three regi- 
ments of Scottish horse under David Leslie, being led by 
Cromwell.' 

The Royalist centre was under the command of Eythin, the 
professional soldier who had come to England from the 
The Royal- German wars as General King, and who had long 
1st army. \,^^x\ the military adviser of Newcastle. On the left, 
opposite the Fairfaxes, was a strong body of horse, under 
Goring, whilst Rupert himself sent his own and other cavalry 
regiments to the right. Whether he intended to take his place 
at the head of this force when the time of battle arrived, or to 
keep aloof to fulfil the duties of a Commander-in-Chief must 
Rupert and remain uncertain. With a soldier's instinct Rupert 
Cromwell, jjg^^j singled out Cromwell as the one soldier worthy of 
his steel. " Is Cromwell there ? " he is reported to have asked 
of a prisoner. " And will they fight ? " continued Rupert as 
soon as he was informed of his presence. " If they will, 
they shall have fighting enough." Rupert bade the prisoner 
return to his own people to bear this message. " If it 
please God," was Cromwell's answer when he heard it, " so 
shall he." ^ 

It was weary waiting amidst the rye, but Leven did not 
judge it prudent to attack. A long ditch ran along the edge 
where the moor skirted the hill, and that ditch was occupied 
by Rupert's musketeers. About four in the afternoon Eythin 
brought up some 3,000 of Newcastle's foot. The cautious 
Altercation Veteran was struck with surprise at the rashness of the

asked Eythin how he liked the marshalling of his army, point- 
ing to a paper on which he had sketched the position of the 
troops. " By God, sir," answered Eythin, " it is very fine in 
the paper, but there is no such thing in the field ! " Rupert, so 
far as can be gathered from the fragmentary information which 
has reached us, contemplated an attack upon the enemy as 
soon as Eythin arrived. The old soldier would not hear of 
beginning a battle so late in the day, and found fault with 
Rupert for placing his men so near the enemy. " They may 
be drawn,'' said Rupert, with unwonted meekness, "to a further 
distance." ■' No, sir," replied Eythin, " it is too late." Risky 
as his position was, Rupert did not seem to understand his 
danger. " We will charge them," he said to Newcastle, " to- 
morrow morning ! " It was now between six and seven, and 
Rupert, calling for provisions, dismounted and began to eat his 
supper at some little distance in the rear. A large number of 
his followers did the like. Newcastle strolled towards his 
coach to solace himself with a pipe. Before he had time to 
take a whiff the battle had begun.'

adopted the view that Rupert had been originally for fighting at once, and 
that he was dissuaded by Eythin, not only because the narrative from 
which I gather it is the more explicit of the two, but because it is in con- 
sonance with Rupert's character and position. Rupert would have been a 
madman to draw up at the edge of the ditch if he did not mean to fight, 
but it was only too lil&lt;e his carelessness that, when he was once there, he 
should omit to take precautions against surprise.

In the centre the Parliamentarians were hardly less success- 
ful. In front of Crawford, who, as Major-General, commanded 
Partial Manchester's foot, the ditch had been filled up, 

Crawfor"!! ^"^^ ^^^ Royalists opposed to him had drawn aside 
end Baiiiie. towards their own left to avoid the unsheltered 
position. There was therefore a gap between the right of their 
foot and the left of Rupert's horse. Into this gap Crawford 
dashed, and then, wheeling sharply round, threw himself on 
the flank of the Royalist infantry. Its hold upon the ditch was 
loosened, and Baillie with his Scots poured over it to attack 
them in front. Yet, pushed back as the main Royalist 
battle was, it did not break into flight as Rupert had fled 
before Cromwell, and under a dark pall of smoke, lighted up 
where the guns flashed and roared, the wild work of slaughter 
had bestrewed the moor with the dying and the dead.^ 

Whilst the Scottish foot were struggling thus manfully, a 
great disaster had happened on the Parliamentary right, where 

' Cromwell's Scoutmaster Watson says nothing of this checlc. Ash is 
equally reticent ; Stockdale, however, puts it plainly (D'Ewes's Diary, 
Haj-l. MSS. 1 66, 87b). 'The Earl of Manchester's horse in the left 
hand battle first routing one regiment or body of horse of the enemy's 
. . . yet after a little time the Earl of Manchester's horse were repulsed 
by fresh supplies of the enemy's, and forced to retreat in some disorder. ' 
This comes from an English source. Leslie's flank charge is mentioned by 
Eglinton (E. 54, 19). Putting these together we can account for the 
ridiculous story told by Crawford of Skeldon to Baillie, that Cromwell 
retired, ' so that he was not so much as present at the service, but his 
troopers were led on by David Leslie.' Hepburn of Humbie, too, says 
that Rupert's charge so humbled Cromwell's men, ' that if David Leslie had 
not supported them they had fled.' On Cromwell's wound, see Bowles's 
Manifest Truths, E. 341, i, p. 30. There was probably a slight check 
resulting from Cromwell's being momentarily incapacitated,

the Yorkshire men were fighting under the two Fairfaxes. 
Fairfax On that sidc the moor was covered with furze, 
defeated. ^^^ jj^g enemy was only to be. reached by way of a 
narrow lane, which ran at right angles with the positions of the 
two armies. The passage was the more difficult as a ditch ran 
on one side of the lane and a hedge on the other, and botb 
hedge and ditch were already lined by the musketeers c&gt;t 
the Royalist army. In that part of the field, too, fought New 
castle's Whitecoats, the chosen regiment which had been 
raised on the edge of the Northern moors, and which had 
clothed itself in a uniform of undyed cloth, vowing to dye it red 
in the blood of the enemy.' 

Whilst Lord Fairfax was struggling with difficulty through 
the lane, his son, picking his way as well as he could farther to 
the right amongst the furze, charged Goring's horse. Sir 
Thomas, indeed, with his immediate followers, broke through, 
but the main body of his cavalry was utterly routed. Dashing 
back upon the Yorkshire infantry on their flank, the frightened 
horsemen trod them down or scattered them irretrievably. 
One Scottish regiment of horse under Lord Eglinton alone 
maintained its steadiness, whilst the Scottish foot, placed in 
reserve behind Lord Fairfax, shared in the general ruin. The 
hillside and the roads which led to Tadcaster were choked by 
the flying rout. The sabres of Goring's horse had full work 
among the fugitives, till the victors wheeled round to betake 
themselves, not to the attack of the enemy's regiments which 
remained unbroken, but to the tempting plunder of the bag- 
gage. As the runaways swept past Tadcaster in panting confu- 
sion, exultant Royalists sped on the news of victory, and bells 
rang and bonfires blazed at Oxford and wherever Charles's name 
was held in honour. ^ 

On the field it seemed as if the news so prematurely 
Resistance believed would be justified by the event. Not all 
Scottish °f Goring's cavalry had followed him in the charge 
infantry. and in the pursuit, and enough remained behind, 
under Sir Charles Lucas, to join their comrades on foot in

pressing hard upon the Scottish infantry in the centre. Taken in 
front and iiank, the hardy Scots were exposed to a trial the most 
severe which on that day befell any part of the Parliamentary 
army. Twice they repelled attack, but each time their ranks 
were thinned. Whole regiments broke and fled. Old Leven 
toiled in vain to restore order. "Although," he cried out to the 
fugitives, "you run from your enemies, yet leave not your 
General." It was all to no purpose, and at last the veteran, 
believing that all was lost, set spurs to his horse, galloping for 
dear life's sake to Wetherby, and through Wetherby, as some 
reports averred, even to Leeds. Yet, though Leven fled, his 
subordinate, Baillie, kept the field. Under him fought the 
regiment of Lord Lindsay, and that which bore the name of 
Lord Maitland, but which was under the command of Lieuten- 
ant-Colonel Pitscottie, whilst a third in reserve under Lums- 
daine moved up in support and maintained the unequal fight. 
A third attack was repulsed, and some ground was even gained. 
Yet so desperate a struggle could not last much longer. Unless 
help came the three heroic regiments which maintained the 
honour of the Scottish name would be swept away. ' 

The needed help was already at hand. The younger Fair- 
fax, staggering from the effect of a wound on his face, had flung 
away the white handkerchief which would expose him to death 

' Eglinton passes over the flight of the greater part of the Scottish 
foot. After describing how his countrymen repulsed two attacks, he says 
that ' Lieutenant-General Baillie and General Major Lumsdaine . . . 
perceiving the greatest weight of the battle to lie sore upon the Earl of 
Lindsay's and Lord Maitland's regiment, sent up a reserve for their 
assistance, after which the enemies' horse, having made a third assault 
upon them, had almost put them to some disorder, but that the Earl of 
Lindsay and Lieutenant-Colonel Pitscottie . . . behaved themselves so 
gallantly, that they quickly made the enemies' horse to retreat, killed Sir 
Charles Lucas's horse, took him prisoner, and gained ground upon the 
foot.' Afterwards we are told that Cromwell and David Leslie came up 
' and met with the enemies' horse, being retreated upon the repulse they 
had from the Scottish foot.' For Leven's flight, however, we are not 
dependent merely on English authorities. Spalding (ii. 383) tells us of it, 
and adds that ' none of our Scottish army bade except three regiments, 
one under the Earl of Lindsay, another under Sir David Leslie, and the 
third under Colonel Lumsdaine, who fought it out stoutly.

and groped his way behind the fight to the spot where Crom- 
well was already halting his victorious horsemen, and peering 
through the smoke to discern, if possible, how the battle was 
going elsewhere. As at Gainsborough, Cromwell had kept his 
men well in hand ; and Crawford, too, had preserved unbroken 
the ranks of the infantry of the Eastern Association. Learning 
the tale of misfortune from the lips of Fairfax, he took his mea- 
sures promptly. Sending a party to follow up Rupert's flying 
squadrons, and leaving David Leslie to deal with the White- 
coats, whilst Crawford supported Baillie, he betook himself to the 
lane's end through which Fairfax had emerged. Fronting south-

disadvantage of the ground, the narrow way through the lane, 

the furze bushes on either side, told heavily against the confused 

mass of horsemen, and Goring's Cavaliers were hurled back 

into hopeless ruin by the serried ranks of the Puritan troopers. 

In the centre David Leslie had flown at the Whitecoats. 

That faithful band retreated into an enclosure, resolved, like 

. the King's Red Regiment at Edgehill, to die where 

of the they stood. They had their wish. Scarcely one of 

their number left the field alive. On the other side, 

Baillie and Crawford advanced steadily against the remainder 

of the Royalist infantry, and when Cromwell and David Leslie, 

having accomplished each his own immediate task, came up to 

aid, all resistance was at an end.'

Diary. Harl. MSS. 166, fol. 87b. The story told to Holies {Memoirs, 15) 
by Crawford about Cromwell's supposed cowardice clearly refers to the 
interval between the defeat of Rupert and the attack on Goring. Craw- 
ford was too busy in attacking the Royalist foot at the beginning of the 
battle to be with Cromwell at the time of the first charge. Besides, he 
dates his accusation as relating to a time ' when the whole army at Marslon 
Moor was in a fair possibility to be utterly routed, and a great part o( it 
running.' It is quite possible that the story had some sort of foundation,

The Parliamentary victory was complete. Four thousand 
Royaiists had been slain. Colours enough, as a contemporary 
A compieie publication expressed it, ' to make surplices for all 
victory. jjjg cathedrals in England, were they white,' ' had 
fallen into the hands of the victors. What was more to the 
purpose, the great force to which they had been opposed had 
ceased to exist as an army. The mutual jealousies of the 
Royalist commanders were inflamed too highly to bear the strain 
of defeat. Rupert threw the blame on the sluggishness of New- 
casde, and Newcastle threw the blame on the rashness of Rupert. 
The courtly Marquis, who was more at home in a riding-school 
than on a field of battle, had yet borne himself bravely

day after the battle he rode off to Scarborough, to ship himself 
for a secure retreat on the Continent. With him were Eythin 
and a crowd of dissatisfied officers, who thought it no shame 
to desert their King. " I will not endure the laughter of the 
Court," was the only explanation of his misconduct which New-
