        <p align="left">Zatta's map is one of the better examples of eighteenth-century 
          speculative cartography, including many named, but nonexistent, rivers 
          and lakes in the interior of northern North America. The cartouche, 
          while extremely decorative, shows animals that are clearly more suited 
          to tropical climates. All of this unscientific mapmaking would change 
          quickly, though, in the ensuing decades, as cartography benefited from 
          a large number of expeditions in Arctic latitudes, beginning with the 
          great English circumnavigator James Cook.</p>

        <p align="left">The title of a recent book, <i>Fakes, Frauds, and Fabricators: 
          Ferrer Maldonado, Fuca, and Fonte: The Straits of Anian, 1542-1792</i> 
          (1999), sums up perfectly the situation facing explorers and cartographers 
          regarding the Northwest Passage during the eighteenth century. Factualized 
          fiction, imaginatively visualized, had many gullible victims, even Benjamin 
          Franklin. Maps of the late 1700s often contained some of the spurious 
          claims, suggestive of the tremendous desire of the West to have a commercial 
          passage to the Orient&#151;even if one had to be willed into existence. 
          The Strait of Ani&aacute;n, the Spanish version of the Northwest Passage, 
          had appeared on maps since the 1560s (on Mercator's 1569 world map, 
          for example)&#151;possibly a reference to Anan, a Chinese province described 
          by Marco Polo&#151;and therefore had been the goal of many expeditions 
          in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

        <p align="left">Ferrer Maldonado was, in fact, a real person&#151;a Spanish 
          navigator who claimed to have sailed from Acapulco in 1588 on an expedition 
          to find a Northeast Passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and who 
          returned to write about it. Various copies of his manuscript, &#147;Relation 
          del descubrimiento del Estrecho de Anian en 1588,&#148;circulated, were 
          printed, and ultimately entered the canon of Northwest Passage literature. 
          Full of fantastical descriptions, Ferrer's whole book has now been branded 
          as improbable and false, but in the eighteenth century his report was 
          used by some cartographers as their justification for drawing a Northwest 
          Passage along the northern edge of the American continent.</p>

          Autograph letter signed, dated 27 May 1762, to Sir John Pringle. [Manuscripts 
          Division: Andre De Coppet Collection. Gift of Andre De Coppet, Princeton 
          Class of 1915.]</p>
        <p align="left">In a 1708 letter published in the London magazine <i>Monthly 
          Miscellany, or Memoirs for the Curious</i>, the writer, an admiral named 
          Bartholomew de Fonte but probably the magazine's editor, stated that 
          he had met a Boston ship coming from the east while he was voyaging 
          eastward along a passage from the Pacific Northwest. Voila! There must 
          be a Northwest Passage in temperate waters. The letter was ignored for 
          thirty years, but revived by Arthur Dobbs [see William Moor and Francis 
          Smith expedition for more on him] as a means to promote further searching. 
          Numerous cartographers, especially the French, promoted the idea in 
          their maps even though Russian discoveries had already discredited the 
          idea. Even prominent, respected, scientific-minded men like Benjamin 
          Franklin entered the discussion with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p align="left">In this letter to Sir John Pringle Franklin presents a 
          detailed examination of the genuineness of &#147;A Letter from Admiral 
          Bartholomew De Fonte, then Admiral of New Spain and Peru, and now Prince 
          of Chili, giving an Account of the most material Transactions in a Journal 
          of his from the Calo of Lima in Peru, on his Discoveries to find out 
          if there was any Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean into the 
          South and Tartarian Sea.&#148; Dr. Pringle (1707-1782), who became physician 
          to King George III in 1774, attained a position of great influence in 
          scientific circles and was elected president of the Royal Society in 
          1772. Franklin begins: &#147;In Compliance with your Request, I sit 
          down to give you my Reasons for believing as I do, that De Fonte's Voyage 
          is genuine.&#148;After thirteen pages of analysis, he summarizes his 
          view in a postscript:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div align="left">My Opinion on the whole is this, That though there may 
          probably be no practical Passage for Ships, there is nevertheless such 
          a Passage for Boats as De Fonte found &amp; has described; &amp; that 
          the Country upon that Passage is for the most part habitable, &amp; 
          would produce all the Necessaries of Life.</div>

        <p align="left">In April 1596, Englishman Michael Lok [see the Martin 
          Frobisher section for more on him] met an old Greek sailor in Venice. 
          The seasoned mariner's name was Apostolos Valerianos, but he had taken 
          the Spanish name of Juan de Fuca. Valerianos boasted of his sailing 
          adventures aboard Spanish ships in search of the Strait of Anian, better 
          known as the Northwest Passage or River of the West. In particular, 
          he claimed to have been sent by the Viceroy of New Spain from Mexico 
          in 1592 with two small ships in search of the Strait of Anian along 
          the Northwest coast of America. Sailing along New Spain and California, 
          he reached a latitude of 47&deg; N, where he found a broad inlet of 
          sea trending north and northeast. At the head of this strait, there 
          was a very high pinnacle or spired rock like a pillar. He entered the 
          sea and found rich country along the shores. After sailing for more 
          than twenty days, Fuca thought that he had reached the &#147;North Sea&#148;(Atlantic), 
          which was very wide in all directions, thus achieving what he had been 
          sent to do&#151;and so he returned to Acapulco. Since then, Fuca had 
          been seeking a reward for his discovery, first in Mexico, then Spain. 
          Lok was unsuccessful in his efforts to bring Fuca to England.</p>
        <p align="left">Lok's account of Fuca's tale was first published in Samuel 
          Purchas's 1625 collection of voyages [book described in the William 
          Baffin section]. Whether the tale was a complete fabrication concocted 
          by Lok or a distortion by a hard-luck sailor has never been determined. 
          However, there are no archival records of such a voyage, and there is 
          no knowledge of a Spanish ship ever having reached beyond 43&deg; N 
          in that period. In the late 1700s, though, the discovery of what is 
          now called Juan de Fuca Strait, straddling Canada and the United States, 
          and Puget Sound revived the story. Fuca's descriptions of the richness 
          of the area are accurate, and there is a tall pillar of rock at the 
          strait's entrance (Pillar Point).</p>
