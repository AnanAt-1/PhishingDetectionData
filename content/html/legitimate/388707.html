<h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId508511"></a>JEmail: McEneney, Mike (MC1953) reports on alumni reunion</h1>
Dear John,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Last weekend was the Annual Alumni Reunion principally for
the Class of 1959, the 50 year class and the Class of 1984, the 25 year
Class. The 50 year Class started the weekend off with a Boat ride that
started in New Rochelle and went down the East River to the Statute of
Liberty. Despite the heavy rain a good time was had by all. The 25 Year
Class had their individual event on Campus where they received their
Silver Anniversay Medals.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday the Class of 1959 attended a brunch in Thomas
Hall where they received their Golden Anniversary Medals which were
presented by Brother Thomas. The Class Gift was $425,000, the largest
Class gift to date. Brother delivered his last formal speech after the
presentation of the gift. A very touching moment. After the Class
picture, and some wine tasting and a medley of scenes from various
Manhattan College Players presentations, Mike Bette, &lsquo;59 led the
procession into Mass.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mass at 5 PM in the Chapel was special. The Principal
Celebrant was Msgr. John (Jack) Meehan, &lsquo;59, the concelebrants
were Fr. George Sharp, &lsquo;59 who was a Medical Doctor for 25 years
before he was ordained and Fr. George Hill, the College Chaplin. Dcn.
Thomas Scanlon, &lsquo;59 was the Deacon of the Mass and Dcn. John
Antenucci, &lsquo;59 was the Deacon of the Word. Ricardo Barbieri,
&lsquo;59 did the Second Reading, George Skau, &lsquo;59 was the Altar
Server Minister of the Eucharist. Brother William Batt, FSC read the
Prayer of the Faithful and Paul Thomas &lsquo;84 was the Cross Bearer.
I did the first Reading, and my brother Edward &lsquo;59 &amp; Barbara
McEneney brought up the Gifts. The Music was outstanding. After the
blessing of the Medals, Brother Thomas again addressed the group in a
very heartfelt farewell.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This was followed by a Clam Bake on the Quad with plenty
of Shrimp, Clams, Oysters followed by individual Lobsters and Corn and
boiled Potatoes. This was followed by Desert and Dancing in Smith. A
great time was had by all.<br>
<br>
The Class of 1960 and the Class of 1985 have a lot to look forward to!<br>

Just returned from the 2009 Reunion. The Class of &lsquo;59 and
&lsquo;84 were well represented. It was good to see many of my
Fraternity brothers as well as class mates from fifty years ago. To be
present for Brother President Thomas J. Scanlan&rsquo;s public

I wanted to again thank you for allowing the public to voice their
thoughts and concerns about the SFC Project. I also wanted to thank you
for truly living up to the task of your positions and making sure of
every detail with nothing but the best interest of Yonkers in mind. At

GM, an American staple, brand, and corner stone for years, just filed
for bankruptcy. As devastating as that may seem to be, it was no
surprise to those that studied GM for years. In my business classes at <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Manhattan College</span>,
GM was a case study.. I practically had nightmares about GM; we talked
about them so much. But I&rsquo;m glad we did as I will never make the
same mistake in my business or any business I take part in. Their
problems today didn&rsquo;t start recently but rather 30 or so years
ago when management at the time didn&rsquo;t make the right decisions
and adapt to the market around them. They didn&rsquo;t reinvest
properly and they were so stuck in their ways and stagnant or should I
say, complacent, that they assumed that people(customers)wouldn&rsquo;t
change their ways and always buy an &ldquo;American product&rdquo;.
Well they did change their ways and they moved onto something different!<br>

[JR: As a little L libertarian, I'm against all "political" projects.
But at least our fellow Jasper is in the fight. Even if on the "wrong"
side. Some of us have had the "fight" beaten out of us. Have to
appreciate those still int he ring swinging. GM's bankruptcy is a
national disgrace. Not the failure; the gooferment interference.]<br>

New Powerful and Timely Christian Novel Explores the Meaning of God&rsquo;s Teachings in the Time of the Apocalypse<br>
John of Divinity has been released by Dorrance Publishing Co., Inc.<br>
<br>
*** begin quote ***<br>
<br>
(PRWEB) June 11, 2009 &mdash; John of Divinity, by New York City
residents Louis Borelli and Vincent J. Maligno, is a powerful and
timely novel exploring the meaning of God&rsquo;s teachings in the time
of the Apocalypse.<br>
<br>
John Divine is sent by God to warn all of mankind of the Second Coming
of Christ Jesus and to call the people of the world to repentance
before it is too late. Under the tutelage of four Archangels, John
grows and begins to understand his call. The reader is likewise drawn
into this three-dimensional adventure of heaven, hell, and Earth.
Originally written as a movie script, John of Divinity was made into
this fast-paced and engaging novel that challenges readers to examine
the world we live in and to consider anew the message of God.<br>
<br>
Louis Borelli is a lifelong resident of New York City, where he works
as a screenwriter. His fervor as a screenwriter and his desire to
understand God&rsquo;s plan helped give birth to the movie script and
this novel. He studied film making at Staten Island Community College.<br>
<br>
Vincent J. Maligno also lives in New York City, where he is employed by the Department of Education. A graduate of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Manhattan College</span>,
he earned master&rsquo;s degrees from University of Oklahoma and
College of Staten Island and completed his doctoral degree at City
University of Los Angeles. Married to Amelia, he is the father of six
children and grandfather of four.<br>
<br>
John of Divinity is a 84-page paperback with a retail price of $14.00.

<h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId583520"></a>ADMINISTRIVIA: Policies</h1>
A question came up about using Jasper Jottings to contact folks
mentioned in Jasper Jottings. Seem appropriate to review the
&ldquo;rules of engagement&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
(1) When I report stories, they have to have &ldquo;community
value&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s very loosely defined. However,
&ldquo;medical advice&rdquo; is reviewed by our &ldquo;medical
staff&rdquo;; &ldquo;legal advice&rdquo; by our &ldquo;legal
staff&rdquo;; and &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; by our &ldquo;taste&rdquo;
committee. All ties are decided by my wife. (Hasn&rsquo;t been any yet!
She thinks I&rsquo;m nuts any way. This just proves it.)<br>
<br>
(2) When I report, if I have an email address for some one I use parenthesis around their Class Year. If not, I use brackets.<br>
<br>
(3) When someone contacts me seeking to connect with another alum, I
reply to their requesting email while putting the sought after person
as a &ldquo;blind carbon copy&rdquo;. I usually include a message like:
&ldquo;I have received your request. By BCC, I am giving &lsquo;old so
and so&rsquo;, your contact information. If he/she chooses to respond,
you&rsquo;ll hear from them.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the end of my
involvement.<br>
<br>
(4) In offering folks &lsquo;Jasper Jottings&rsquo;, I promise not to
share email or phone numbers. I don&rsquo;t spam them, or sell stuff to
them.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve helped link ex-wives, lost kids, old girl friends, old
drinking buddies. Never had any complaints because I just pass along
the info and let folks act on it.<br>
<br>
Soooo, if you share your email address with me or that of a fellow alum, then be assured I don&rsquo;t give them out.<br>
<br>
On occasions, I&rsquo;ve even usmailed messages to folks that I thought they&rsquo;d want. But that&rsquo;s pretty rare.<br>
<br>

<br>
P.S., If someone is unhappy with Yahoo&rsquo;s reliability, then they
can donate a Constant Contact subscription. This is a near-zero budget
operation.<br>

Latitude Names O&rsquo;Donnell to Lead New Staten Island Office<br>
Friday, June 12, 2009<br>
<br>
*** begin quote ***<br>
<br>
New Jersey based Latitude Equipment Leasing has named Arthur
O&rsquo;Donnell to head up the company&rsquo;s new office in Staten
Island, New York.<br>
<br>
O&rsquo;Donnell brings over 25 successful years in banking to the firm and holds an engineering degree from <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Manhattan College</span> and a finance MBA from Pace University.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In the current economy, my clients and vendors need more leasing
options in order to succeed. The timing is perfect for me to expand my
ability to provide these options,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Donnell said.<br>
<br>
Latitude principal Duane Rouba says field office expansion is a key
strategy for the company. Including the New York office, Latitude has
added six locations in the past two months, including two new offices
in Texas, and one in Milwaukee.<br>

Notre Dame&rsquo;s Betrayal<br>
By Patrick J. Reilly<br>
president, Cardinal Newman Society<br>
<br>
*** begin quote ***<br>
<br>
In 2004 the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement
which reads, in part: &ldquo;The Catholic community and Catholic
institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our
fundamental moral principles. They should not be given awards, honors
or platforms which would suggest support for their actions.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
*** and ***<br>
<br>
Catholic principles don&rsquo;t change with party affiliation, and all
serious Catholics would be happy if abortion and other intrinsic evils
were opposed by both Democrats and Republicans.<br>
<br>
*** end quote ***<br>
<br>
[JR: The "Catholic" brand has been damaged by the priestly pedophilia
and pro-abortion politician scandal. I'm no saint, but I'm insulted by
these two "bad examples". The leaders of the Church have to reassert
control of their "brand". Otherwise, they fail. At the very least, they
have to apply the whip to those who give public scandal. The Amish
shun; Catholics, and those kindred spirits, have to do the same.
Remember that on voting day!]<br>
