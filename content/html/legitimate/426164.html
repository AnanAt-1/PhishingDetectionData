                                        of the major huge contracts that helped doom the N.H.L.-N.H.L.P.A.&#x2019;s 1995 collective bargaining agreement. That pact ended the first lockout of the players by ownership in 1994, a deal that eventually sent
                                        salaries spiraling out of control and led to the second lockout, the lost season of 2004-05 and the salary cap settlement that followed.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sakic almost became a Ranger. Early in August 1997, a year removed from leading his team to the Stanley Cup, the 28-year-old Avs captain was a restricted free agent. The Rangers had just lost Mark Messier to free agency
                                        and Vancouver, so G.M. Neil Smith had extra money and took the bold and unorthodox step of signing Sakic to an offer sheet of $21 million over three seasons, more than doubling his salary.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Even today, teams don&#x2019;t often take runs at restricted free agents. The most recent notable R.F.A. signing was the Oilers spiriting Dustin Penner away from Anaheim, leading to a very public feud between the teams&#x2019;
                                        G.M.&#x2019;s, Brian Burke and Kevin Lowe. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But the Rangers were desperate to replace Messier, and the Avalanche were in financial trouble. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/07/sports/sakic-signs-offer-from-rangers.html">Joe Lapointe reported in The Times</a>,
                                        they were playing in the outmoded McNichols Arena, had cash flow problems and had just signed Peter Forsberg to a two-year deal reportedly paying him $4 million and then $5 million, which was suddenly top dollar
                                        for its time. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/13/sports/signs-point-to-avalanche-keeping-sakic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=ascent%20entertainment&amp;st=cse">The Times&#x2019; Richard Sandomir</a> reported that Ascent Entertainment,
                                        owners of the Avs and the N.B.A. Nuggets, had &#x201C;lost $36 million on revenues of $258 million. For the three months ending March 31, Ascent lost another $17.6 million.&#x201D; </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So the Avs seemed like an easy target, and to make it tougher on them, Smith front-loaded the proposed deal, offering Sakic a $15 million signing bonus in addition to his $2 million annual salary. It meant Sakic would
                                        be due $17 million for the 1997-98 season. The Rangers would have to forfeit their next five first-round draft picks to Colorado, which Smith was prepared to do. Avs had a week to match the offer and keep Sakic.<br>
                                        <span id="more-15885"></span></p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/avalanche/ci_12806236">Terry Frei recalls in today&#x2019;s Denver Post</a>, Sakic admitted being &#x201C;stunned&#x201D; by the offer but excited about the chance to play with
                                        Wayne Gretzky, who had joined the Rangers the previous season. Yet, the decorous Sakic was anything but dismissive of Denver. &#x201C;I know I&#x2019;ll be playing here in a place I love, or I&#x2019;ll be going
                                        to the great city of New York,&#x201D; he said.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>In what must</strong> have been a furious series of negotiations, Ascent Entertainment (which was controlled by Charlie Lyons, who had bought the Nordiques in May 1995 after the Nords could not get government
                                        financing for a new arena in Quebec, easily the league&#x2019;s smallest market) reached an agreement with local political officials that let them out of their McNichols lease, at a cost of $15.5 million spread
                                        over 25 years. That guaranteed that the Pepsi Center, under Ascent ownership with 95 luxury boxes and 1,850 club seats, would move toward realization. McNichols had 18 tiny luxury suites.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Ascent also lined up $15 million from Liberty Media to help pay for the Pepsi Center and got Fox Sports Rocky Mountain, their cable TV rights holder (a joint venture of Liberty Media and Fox Sports) to agree on a seven-year
                                        extension of the Avs&#x2019; and Nuggets&#x2019; TV deals. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;The deal, said to include no up-front payments to the teams, is nonetheless a guarantee of future cash flow, reported to be worth at least a combined $100 million through 2004,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/14/sports/cable-wires-are-tangled-as-avalanche-receives-aid.html">Sandomir reported in The Times</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">(Sandomir noted that Liberty Media and Fox Sports also both had a minority share of the Rangers at the time. He wrote: </p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><small>&#x201C;In June, Fox Sports Net paid $850 million for 40 percent of Cablevision Systems&#x2019; 75 percent stake in Rainbow Sports, which owns six regional Sportschannels and Madison Square Garden &#x2014; the owner of the arena, the Rangers, the Knicks and the MSG Network. Add to all this corporate incestuousness the recent 33 percent interest taken in Cablevision by Tele-Communications Inc., the parent company of Liberty.</small></p><small>
</small>
                                        <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><small>Essentially, in coming to the aid of the Denver franchises, Fox and Liberty bettered one part of their vast universe, their television rights, to the detriment of another, the Rangers. Providing the Avalanche with financial muscle to justify a $15 million signing bonus and $2 million annual salaries for three years for the talented Sakic should help ratings and attendance in Denver.&#x201D;</small></p>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sandomir wondered about the conspiratorial possibilities in this situation, imagining late-night phone calls between Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox, and John Malone, the &#x201C;mastermind&#x201D; of
                                        TCI, owners of Liberty Media. Such are the optics involved in cross ownership. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He was also intrigued by the timing of the deals, and his digging got an admission from a Fox executive that Sakic&#x2019;s offer sheet accelerated negotiations that had been taking place for six months on extending
                                        the teams&#x2019; TV rights. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It looked funny on the surface, the exec acknowledged, but really Fox and Liberty Media were primarily interested in making the Avs, Nuggets and their Denver regional sports network stronger. They had little power in
                                        MSG and Rangers affairs, but still, Sandomir noted, &#x201C;the timing seemed curious. Everything fell into place yesterday for maximum exposure: the arena deal became final, the television deals extended, Liberty&#x2019;s
                                        investment in the arena disclosed, the Sakic offer matched.&#x201D;)</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So these steps proved good enough to finance the Avs&#x2019; match of the Rangers offer to Sakic, and he stayed in Colorado. Frei writes that after the Avs matched, Lyons sent MSG President Dave Checketts a framed copy
                                        of the famous picture of Nelson Rockefeller&#x2019;s single-digit response to hecklers at a 1976 campaign stop.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>But of greater consequence,</strong> the contract raised the benchmark salary of elite-level N.H.L. players from about $3 million to about $7 million, an explosive leap, and the salaries of N.H.L. talent began
                                        to run away.</p>

                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Avs G.M. Pierre Lacroix told Joe Lapointe in The Times that the Sakic affair would be a sign of a new era of bidding for the restricted free agents. &#x201D;The dance is open,&#x201D; Lacroix said. &#x201D;The Rangers
                                        were very active on the free-agent galaxy. The way they are going, the way they are acting, I&#x2019;m sure they are going to be the first team to sign an alien and to have an alien to play for their team. I just
                                        hope the planet of the alien will have a chance to match.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Lacroix was right (well, not about the alien part of his rant). Two other R.F.A. contracts signed shortly afterward contributed to the rapid escalation of salaries. Anaheim&#x2019;s Paul Kariya was coming off a big
                                        season and wanted Sakic-type money, up from the $2.075 million he had gotten in 1996-97. The Ducks made him a qualifying offer of a 10 percent raise which he rejected. He skipped training camp and the team&#x2019;s
                                        first 32 games. The team got off to a bad start and caved in. Kariya got Sakic-type money &#x2014; a two-year deal for $14 million.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Wanting to be similarly compensated, Kariya&#x2019;s linemate Teemu Selanne negotiated an extension to his contract with Anaheim after the 1997-98 season, bringing his salary by the end of the deal in 2001-02 to $9.5
                                        million. Just a little more California sunshine.</p>

                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;The Sakic offer from the Rangers, which Colorado matched, was the first one that saw salaries go up (for Groups 2&#x2019;s),&#x201D; one N.H.L. general manager who requested anonymity told <a href="https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=99378&amp;hubname=nhl">Canadian Press in a 2004 interview</a>.
                                        &#x201C;And then shortly after that, Kariya and Selanne, as Group 2&#x2019;s, with no other rights, not even arbitration rights (in Kariya&#x2019;s case), they signed enormous contracts.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;They were good players, but they hadn&#x2019;t won anything and their new deals took them right up to where Sakic was. So those signings affected the entire Group 2 market and became comparable in salary arbitration.
                                        And they really hurt, because Kariya was making $7 million and a guy with numbers almost as good is only making $2 million but he now thinks he&#x2019;s worth $5 million.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sakic, Kariya, Selanne and Forsberg were all represented by the same agent, Winnipeg-based Don Baizley.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The third big R.F.A. deal belonged to the Flyers&#x2019; Eric Lindros, who was 24 at the time. He signed a two-year contract extension with Philadelphia in January 1998 worth $16 million. Soon other R.F.A.&#x2019;s
                                        were getting megadeals. Forsberg&#x2019;s salary jumped to $10 million, as did Jaromir Jagr&#x2019;s. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>So while Sakic&#x2019;s</strong> retirement brings a great career to a close, it&#x2019;s important to keep in mind the role he played in how the game changed. It wasn&#x2019;t his fault salaries escalated &#x2014;
                                        Sakic didn&#x2019;t ask the Rangers for the huge offer &#x2014; but he and his fellow players were no doubt overjoyed they did. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And the Rangers, wild spenders that they seemed to be with the money they saved by not signing Messier, were operating with the provisions of the C.B.A. and just trying to stay competitive &#x2014; which they didn&#x2019;t.
                                        Their history might have been much different if the Avs hadn&#x2019;t matched the offer. Instead, the Rangers wound up missing the playoffs for a franchise-record seven straight seasons. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And those five first-round draft choices the Rangers held on to by not getting Sakic? They turned into Manny Malholtra (1998), Pavl Brendl (1999), Jamie Lundmark (also selected in 1999 in a trade with Tampa Bay in exchange
                                        for the first pick in 2000), Dan Blackburn (2001), and the 2002 first-round pick, which went to Florida as part of the package for Pavel Bure.</p>

                                            the other deals, it definitely played a part in the rapid escalation of salaries. </p>
                                        <p>To this day, that holdout and subsequent contract is one of the chief complaints against Sergei by Wings&#x2019; fans (which I really don&#x2019;t understand why they won&#x2019;t embrace him, but that&#x2019;s
                                            another topic for another time).</p>

                                        <p>Actually I&#x2019;d point to Eric Lindros as the player who radically changed the way players were valued &#x2013; he signed that previously-unheard-of multi-million dollar deal with the Flyers before he ever played
                                            a single game in the NHL. IMO.</p>

                                        <p>Marc &#x2013; Absolutely. Fedorov&#x2019;s deal of 1998 should be considered in this discussion as one of the deals of this era. It&#x2019;s especially relevant because the &#x2018;Canes did exactly what the Rangers
                                            had done previously with Sakic, front-loading the contract with bonuses and hoping Detroit wouldn&#x2019;t match. </p>
                                        <p>And, yes, the &#x2018;Canes bonus offer on making the Conference Championships ( the semifinals), appears especially cynical since they were last in their division when they made the offer and weren&#x2019;t going
                                            to make the playoffs while Detroit was battling for first overall. That means it would have reduced the size of the deal to around $4.67 million, and that&#x2019;s not Sakic-type money. (I don&#x2019;t recall,
                                            however, if the Semis bonus was good for the entire length of the six year deal or just that first year, maybe you do.) As it was, he got the bonus from Detroit and the annual average of the contract was $6.33
                                            mil, still a bit under what Sakic was getting and at a longer term, which could explain why he may have grumbled later on when he was getting around two-thirds of what the game&#x2019;s other top stars were
                                            getting.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Another difference between the two offers as you probably know, is that in the case of the Sakic offer, it was made in the off season, about a month into free agency, early August. In Fedorov&#x2019;s case, he was
                                            a hold-out and looking for big money (deservedly so, after winning the Hart and Pearson, twice winning the Selke Trophy and with the Wings having just won the Cup in a playoff campaign in which he was Detroit&#x2019;s
                                            leading scorer). The offer didn&#x2019;t come until February and the Wings signed him on Feb. 26. The offer from Carolina came well into the season and essentially broke the log jam in the negotiations. The
                                            league actually challenged the offer sheet, saying it did not comply with the CBA, but an arbitrator ruled in favor of the offer, it stood and Detroit was forced to match.</p>

                                        <p>Speed Ranger &#x2013; Thanks for your comment. and you are right about Lindros&#x2019;s first deal being inflationary. It was a five year deal for $22 million, $4.4 mil a season. There had been other rookies who
                                            signed for big money before him, but as I recall, his might have been the largest sum for a rookie. </p>
                                        <p>However, (again working from memory here) I think the 1995 CBA instituted the rookie salary cap which prevented that from happening again. So in the salary inflation era about which I was writing in this post, which
                                            is the era covered by the CBA negotiated to end the first lockout, rookie salaries were no longer a factor in salary inflation. It was Group 2 free agent players (RFA&#x2019;s) who were driving that train.</p>

                                        <p>Stu, the Semis bonus was only in the first year of the deal. Once all the front-end options were out of the way, you&#x2019;re right the deal really was an annual steal. Fedorov in his prime was worth much more
                                            than $2mil a year, escalated salaries or not. </p>
                                        <p>Admittedly, it wasn&#x2019;t on the same scale as the Sakic offer, but certainly the Peter Karmanos and Jim Rutherford were paying attention when they crafted their own.</p>

                                        <p>Great job outlining those Ranger draft picks. Still wonder how Sather keeps his role after all these years and frankly terrible drafts. I guess it all comes back to Wade Redden, doesn&#x2019;t everything? I still
                                            would love to know what teams were bidding against the Rangers when they offered him 6 years for 35+ million. The only other question is what kind of return did the Avs get?</p>

                                        <p>rick b &#x2013; Not all those draft picks saved from not signing Sakic came under Sather&#x2019;s watch. Neil Smith was the GM for the &#x2019;98 and &#x2019;99 drafts and was replaced by Sather in June 2000, and
                                            Smith was responsible for the trade of the first pick the previous year. </p>
                                        <p>Of course, of all the first round picks Sather has had since he became G.M., only Marc Staal has become a Ranger. Not all the picks in every draft year have been barren for the Rangers. The &#x2019;04 draft yielded
                                            Dubinsky, Korpikoski and Callahan. The rest, however, have (so far) been pretty poor. </p>
