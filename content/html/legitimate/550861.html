Bigotry against Jews<br>
Posted: 29th October 2010<br>
By Lesley John<br>
      <br>
*** begin quote ***<br>
      <br>
Every year, the Religious Department at MC invites a religious scholar
to participate in a Thomas Aquinas lecture. This year, Dr. Mary C.
Boys, a professor at Union Theological Seminary, was invited to speak
in the Alumni Room of O&rsquo; Malley Library. The topic revolved
around the cross and the hatred that exists between the Christians and
various religious groups. This year, the lecture tried to answer the
question &ndash; Is the cornerstone of Christian faith a stumbling
block to Jews?<br>
      <br>
*** and ***<br>
      <br>
Slowly, Dr. Boys razed the stumbling block by alluding to several
historical documents and by challenging the audience to take a stand
against such bigotry. &ldquo;Learn and face it&hellip;Be troubled by
it!&rdquo; In reaction to this lecture, Br. Robert Berger, F.S.C said,
&ldquo;I think she gave a very understandable presentation. It covered
all the bases, and I think that it challenged our students to look into
the future.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
*** end quote ***<br>
      <br>
[JR: With all the problems that we have, why we allow hatred and
bigotry to exist just seems dumb. Homer Simpson dumb! I'm remind of the
Gandhi quote: "I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your
Christians are so unlike your Christ." Hopefully , we've learned to be
better people from our time at MC.]<br>

Maybe this is what capitalism (or small undertaxed, underregulated govenrment) has brought us to!<br>
      <br>
[JR: Might be. But, I suggest that it's huge bloated enslaving
Gooferment teaching its slaves their proper place (i.e., on their knees
before the "King"). Sorry, but how can you blame capitalism, when we
haven't had a "free market" in decades?]<br>

Brother James Joseph Roth, CSC<br>
January 4, 1922 &ndash; November 12, 2010<br>
      <br>
The prayers of the members of the Congregation of Holy Cross are
requested for the repose of the soul of Brother James Roth, CSC, a
member of the Eastern Province of Brothers who died at Dujarie House,
Notre Dame, IN. Brother James was in the 57th year of religious life in
the Congregation.<br>
      <br>
James Joseph Roth was born on January 4, 1922 to Edward Michael Roth
and Margaret Cecilia Donegan, the third child in a family of five
children. James attended Blessed Trinity Grammar School and Riverside
High School in Buffalo, NY. Following his graduation from high school,
James was a dispatcher for Curtiss Propeller Corporation. When the
United States entered the Second World War, James entered the Army Air
Corps on December 4, 1942, and earned the rank of Sergeant. He was
stationed at Bradley Field, CT, San Diego, CA, Langley Field, VA, and
Camp Pinedale, Fresno, CA. Following his discharge from the Army Air
Corp on February 20, 1946, James attended The Catholic University of
America, Washington, DC from 1949-1951, and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Manhattan College</span>,
New York, NY from 1951-1953 where he earned his Bachelor of Electrical
Engineering degree. While at Manhattan College, James worked as a
magnetron tester for the Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation. James
entered St. Joseph Juniorate, Valatie, NY on June 15, 1953, and he was
received into the Congregation of Holy Cross at St. Joseph Novitiate,
Rolling Prairie, IN where he pronounced his first vows on August 16,
1954. On August 23, 1958, Brother James pronounced his perpetual vows
in the Congregation and also took the Mission Vow.<br>
      <br>
His ministry as a mathematics teacher spanned over 50 years, starting
at Dujarie Hall from 1954-55. He then taught in various schools of the
Congregation: Cathedral High School, Indianapolis, IN (1955-57), Holy
Cross High School, Flushing, NY (1957-61 and 1970-74), Monsignor Coyle
High School, Taunton, MA (1961-64), Vincentian High School, Albany, NY
(1964-66 and 1968-70), and Bethlehem Catholic High School, Bethlehem,
PA (1966-68). It was during the summer months between 1964 to1969 that
Brother James earned his MTS degree from The Catholic University of
America, Washington, DC. He was then assigned to the staff at St.
Joseph Center, Valatie, NY (1974-76), before being assigned to Cardinal
Mooney High School, Rochester, NY (1976-83) and Holy Cross College,
Notre Dame, IN (1983-2001). He moved to Columba Hall (2001-07), but
continued to tutor at Holy Cross College. In 2007, he retired from
teaching ministry and moved to Schubert Villa, Notre Dame, IN for one
year. Due to failing health in 2008, Brother James moved to Dujarie
House. Brother James was a member of the National Council of Teachers
of Mathematics.<br>
      <br>
Throughout his life he enjoyed playing tennis which was very difficult
for him to give up as his health declined. His academic background in
Engineering and Mathematics fit well with his personality of exactness
and precision. In conversation, he would always choose his words
carefully which made him extremely clear when teaching.<br>
      <br>
Brother James is the last of his family as all of his siblings have predeceased him. He is survived by many nieces and nephews.<br>
      <br>
The Congregation of Holy Cross joins with his family and friends in celebrating the life and ministry of our brother James<br>
      <br>
May our brother James rest in God&rsquo;s loving embrace! Ave Crux, Spes Unica!<br>
      <br>
There will be a Mass for Brother James on Monday November 15th at 7 pm at Dujarie House, Notre Dame, IN.<br>
      <br>
On Wednesday November 17th at 7 pm there will be a wake service at St.
Joseph Center, Valatie, NY followed by mass and burial at 11 am on
Thursday<br>
      <br>
If you will be coming to St. Joseph Center on Thursday, please RSVP for lunch following the burial: 518.784.9481 x209<br>

Manhattan College Inducts Eight Honorees to Athletic Hall of Fame<br>
      <br>
RIVERDALE, N.Y. &ndash; Manhattan College will hold its 32nd annual
Athletic Hall of Fame Induction on Saturday, Nov. 13 at 6:00 p.m. in
Smith Auditorium, sponsored by the Manhattan College Alumni Society.
The eight honored inductees are: Brenton Birmingham &rsquo;95,
men&rsquo;s basketball; Roger Freda &rsquo;67, football; Joseph Hayes
&rsquo;36, swimming (posthumously); George Kiefer &rsquo;36, baseball
(posthumously); James McHugh, track and field coach 1962-1969; Steven
Quagliano &rsquo;78, crew; Br. Thomas Scanlan, F.S.C., Manhattan
president 1987-2009; and Sophia Tasker-Sterling &rsquo;97, track.<br>
      <br>
In addition, the 1930-1931 basketball team, selected as the No. 1
college basketball team in New York City by The New York Times, and the
1965-1968 football team, which won the 1966 club national championship,
will also be honored at the ceremony.<br>
      <br>
The 2010 Athletic Hall of Fame inductees will be recognized for their
tremendous hard work and commitment to Manhattan College&rsquo;s
athletic program.<br>
      <br>
Their accomplishments include:<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Brenton Birmingham &rsquo;95, men&rsquo;s basketball
&ndash; In his first game for Manhattan against Hofstra, Birmingham set
a school record by sinking six of seven from three-point land. In the
last seven games of his junior year, he shot 64 percent from the floor,
with 52 percent from three-point range. He played both the small
forward and shooting guard positions and kept the Jaspers from losing a
game at home (the only season that ever happened). In addition, he was
the high scorer when the Jaspers played their first NCAA Tournament
game in 35 years. During his senior year, he received the Mike Cohen
Award (MVP), and was named First Team All-Metropolitan, Academic
All-American District 1-First Team, MAAC All-Tournament Team, MAAC
All-Academic Team and All-MAAC Second Team.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Roger Freda &rsquo;67, football &ndash; When Manhattan
reintroduced a football team to the athletic lineup in 1965 after not
having a team since World War II, Freda started his career with the
College. Freda was known for making thrilling catches that changed the
pace of many games. As a wingback (wide receiver), Freda&rsquo;s
touchdown helped to win his first game as a Jasper against NYU with a
score of 20-14. The highlight of Freda&rsquo;s football career occurred
when the Jaspers defeated the Fordham Rams for the first time 38-26,
after he retrieved an almost intercepted ball and ran into the end
zone. He was awarded the MVP trophy for the game for bringing victory
to the Jaspers against Fordham for the first time in history.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Joseph Hayes &rsquo;36, swimming (posthumously) &ndash;
Hayes was often called &ldquo;The Iron Man&rdquo; in the pool because
of his scoring in many races at each competition, and had an undefeated
record as a freshman. The highlight of Hayes&rsquo; swimming career was
during his junior year when he set the record for the 50-yard
freestyle, an extremely difficult task for a long distance swimmer. He
continued to be a vital member of the team, leading the Jaspers to a
victory over Fordham University and serving as an anchor on many relays
for the remainder of his college career.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * George Kiefer &rsquo;36, baseball (posthumously) &ndash;
As a Metropolitan All-Star shortstop, he was known for his ability with
the bat and glove. Although he was sidelined with a broken ankle early
in his sophomore season, Kiefer came back his junior year to news
stories heralding him &ldquo;as potentially the greatest ball player to
swing for the Green in many a season.&rdquo; He was also named to the
All-New York College Baseball team.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * James McHugh, track and field coach 1962-1969 &ndash; In
1962, McHugh started working at Manhattan College as the assistant
track and field coach and sports information director before taking
over as head coach for six years. During what would be considered a
short tenure, he won nine Metropolitan Intercollegiate Championships
(two cross country, four indoors and three outdoors). When the 1968
track year concluded, McHugh&rsquo;s athletes held 17 of the 26
Manhattan College track records. He also has 11 of his Jaspers in the
Athletic Hall of Fame.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Steven Quagliano &rsquo;78, crew &ndash; Quagliano led
his freshman 8 and 4+ team into several wins his first season in the
coxswain position, including first place finishes in the Freshman 4+
and second place finishes in the Freshman 8 at the Grimaldi Cup Regatta
and the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Rowing Championships (MIRA). That
year he also made the semifinals in the Freshman 4+ in the highly
competitive Dad Vail Regatta, competing with 1,100 rowers from 48
schools. In fact, he reached the semis or finals (one as coach) all
four years of his collegiate career at this national level. When the
team faltered after losing coach Tom Delaney due to illness, most
thought the season was lost. Quagliano, however, stepped down from his
position as coxswain to serve as the team&rsquo;s coach. Under his
leadership, the Jaspers had victories at the Grimaldi Cup, MIRA
Championship and placed second in the Marist College President Cup. The
Freshman Lightweight 8 also stroked their way to a third place finish
at the prestigious Dad Vail Regatta, and this was the best finish for a
Jasper 8 since World War II.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; * Br. Thomas Scanlan, F.S.C., Manhattan president
1987-2009 &ndash; Br. Scanlan brought Jasper athletics to a new level
during his tenure, and created a program that was balanced for both men
and women with scholarships available for all 19 Division I athletic
teams on campus. He was instrumental in bringing three new programs to
campus &mdash; women&rsquo;s soccer, men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s
lacrosse. With 72 MAAC Post-Season Championships and 18 MAAC
Regular-Season Championships notched on his belt during his 66 seasons
on campus, Br. Scanlan made sure that academics were not compromised
while enhancing the athletic program. Hundreds of All-Academic MAAC
athletes attest to the integrity of an athletic program that proved
excellent students could also excel on the court and field.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Sophia Tasker-Sterling &rsquo;97, track &ndash; During
Sterling&rsquo;s athletic career at Manhattan, she achieved five track
records for the College. She continued to set records in every
category, whether indoors or outdoors, relays or individual races.
Today, her records still stand in indoor, including: the 55-meter dash
with a time of 6.92 at the ECAC Championships in Boston in 1997, and
the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.49 at the George Mason Invitational
in Fairfax in 1997. Her records in outdoor include: the
4&times;400-meter in 45.76 at the ECAC Championships in Fairfax in1996,
the 4&times;200-meter relay in 1:38.25 at the Penn Relays in 1997, and
the Sprint Medley in 3:57.21 at the Penn Relays in 1995. Sterling was
All-East five times and still holds a MAAC Championship Record of 7.09
set in 1997. She placed first in the 4&times;100-meter outdoors as a
sophomore at the Mets, the 100-meter dash outdoors as a junior, and the
55-meter indoors as a senior.<br>

By last count, I had 398 friends. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking:
this girl must be incredibly popular, right? And what a social life!<br>
      <br>
But of course, it&rsquo;s all a farce. These are friends of the
Facebook variety. Which means they&rsquo;re a mix of random
acquaintances, classmates I haven&rsquo;t seen or spoken to in more
than a decade, a similar contingent of college-era friends, a
smattering of co-workers, a few dozen cousins and other assorted
relatives, etc. There are, of course, some who are the &ldquo;genuine
article&rdquo; &ndash; those who I count as true friends both in
cyberspace and in real life.<br>
      <br>
*** and ***<br>
      <br>
In fact, I&rsquo;d say the social networking site has done more to
bring us all back together than anything since my Uncle Bill&rsquo;s
Farrell Family Facts newsletter. (The monthly publication had quite the
cult following at Manhattan College.)<br>

she'll be an inet "celebrity", just maybe, the paper will give her a

It&rsquo;s not too often I&rsquo;ll notice anything in the sports world
(I think the longest part of a baseball game I ever watched in my life
was as a freshman in the TV room of Chrysostom Hall when the Mets went
into 23 innings &mdash; I watched the last five or so &mdash; and
I&rsquo;ve got NO idea who won the last World Series or Superbowl!) but
a headline in the online Daily Pennsylvanian caught my eye today.<br>
      <br>
Well done to the Jaspers for beating the Quakers! :) I did graduate
work at Penn, but my heart still lies in Manhattan! Nice feather to
beat a big Ivy-Leaguer like Penn!<br>

[JR: Thanks for the link. As far as pro sports, MP4B!
(&ldquo;Millionaires Playing For Billionaires&rdquo;) Usually at
taxpayer expense. College is "interesting". Especially when, as the
NCAA would like us to believe that the NCAA is all about "most of us
will go pro in something else other than sports". As opposed to the big
bucks made by the NCAA off the sweat of "students". I think that there
is something that can be noble in overcoming oneself, adversity, or
even team communications. It can provide a peek into the human soul and
what is entirely possible. It, in the case of some pro athletes, also
provides a snapshot of the worst in human behavior -- have it all and
not honoring that "gift of fate". Vick, the dog fighter, is in today's
NYPost taunting the Giants. He should be worrying about Karma. Argh! In
any event, kudos to both the winners and losers for showing us -- life,
vitality, and the joy of the journey. It's nice to win, but some wag
said "we learn from our failures". I sure have had enough lessons to
learn. LOL!]<br>

COOPERSTOWN _ Gerald L. Fitzgerald, a World War II combat veteran,
Catholic social justice leader and public relations executive, died

      <br>
His wife of 60 years, Eileen McGinty Fitzgerald, died in 2008.<br>
      <br>
Mr. Fitzgerald loved his family, his native New York City and The New
York Times, lectoring at Mass, dispensing bear hugs and taking
photographs.<br>
      <br>
He was born in the Bronx on May 30, 1923, the only child of James and
Margaret Henry Fitzgerald. He graduated from LaSalle High School in
Manhattan and entered <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Manhattan College</span>, but he interrupted his education to enroll in the Army in 1942.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
Mr. Fitzgerald married Eileen McGinty in 1948. They built a house in
the Bronx and became active members of St. Benedict&rsquo;s Parish,
with Mr. Fitzgerald taking leadership roles in the Holy Name Society
and Catholic Charities and becoming one of the parish&rsquo;s most
popular lectors. The Fitzgeralds joined the Christian Family Movement,
a Catholic organization fostering social justice, and became lead
couple in the Archdiocese of New York.<br>

Mr. Fitzgerald had a long career on Wall Street in financial public
relations, retiring from Doremus &amp; Co. in 1986. He and Eileen then

[JR: I was NOT for her to be confirmed. She&rsquo;s right in the sense
that this little L libertarian can&rsquo;t find the Constitutional
basis for the Gooferment to kill anyone. But, please, the
&lsquo;safety&rsquo; of drug designed to kill the victim? She should
have kicked off her tour with the Supremes by having one of her
whizbang clerks write up the Constitutionality of the Death Penalty in
the first place. In injineering skrule, we didn&rsquo;t get credit for
the right result for the wrong work. Even if the bridge stayed up, it
was luck; not injineering! Same too here, the death penalty is
unconstitutional and un DofI. Right to Life! At the beginning and the
end.]<br>
