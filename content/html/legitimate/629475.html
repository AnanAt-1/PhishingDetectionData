	    In discussing such films as <strong>Touching the Void</strong> (2003), <strong>Capturing
	    the Friedmans</strong>	    (2003) and the work of Nick Broomfield, this timely introduction to the
	    growing field of documentary explores the definition and understanding
	    of the form, as well as the relationship between documentary and drama.
	    Paul
	    Ward also examines animated documentaries, the fertile meeting point
	    of comedy and documentary modes, the ability of documentary to accurately
	    represent
	    historical events, and feature-length contemporary works that have achieved
	    widespread cinematic release. Softcover, 115 pp. $28.00.</P>

	    David A. Goldsmith<br>
	    A series of &quot;in-their-own-words&quot; interviews with 15 directors
	    whose work has, in some way, extended the boundary of the documentary.
	    Their opinions vary: some will work only on film, while others have embraced
	    the
	    latest in digital video technology; some question, even abhor, the use
	    of commentary, others wouldn't dream of doing without it; some work by
	    the rules of cinema verite, while others employ stylization and dramatization.
	    These 15 conversations constitute only a tiny proportion of those working
	    in the field, but they represent the state of the documentary around
	    the
	    world. Hardcover, 176 pp. $57.95. <br>

		    Jonathan B. Vogels<br>
		    The Maysles brothers' particular style, which they called &quot;direct

		    documentary. They are mentioned in many historical surveys of documentary
		    film, but this book is the first full-length treatment of their career.
		    In <strong>The Direct Cinema of David and Albert Maysles</strong>, Jonathan B. Vogels
		    provides a critical assessment of the complete Maysles catalog, while
		    shedding light
		    on the issues of direct cinema as a whole, and underscoring the technical
	    and aesthetic achievements of their unique body of work.
