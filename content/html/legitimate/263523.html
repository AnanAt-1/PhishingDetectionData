<p>
Elkhound is a parser generator, similar to <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">Bison</a>.  The
parsers it generates use the Generalized LR (GLR) parsing algorithm.
GLR works with <em>any</em> context-free grammar, whereas LR parsers
(such as Bison) require grammars to be LALR(1).

<p>
Parsing with arbitrary context-free grammars has two key advantages:
(1) unbounded lookahead, and (2) support for ambiguous grammars.
Unbounded lookahead is achieved by allowing multiple potential parses
to coexist for as long as necessary.  Similarly, ambiguity is handled
by letting potential parses be coalesced, with special action taken
to handle the ambiguous region of the input.  In general, by using the
GLR algorithm, Elkhound avoids the difficulty of trying to make a
language grammar fit the LALR(1) restrictions.

<p>
What's more, the Elkhound implementation of GLR is competitive with
good LR implementations (particularly Bison) for grammars and grammar
fragments that are LALR(1).  Its high performance is a result of a
novel combination of GLR and LR parsing, wherein the parser decides on
a token-by-token basis which algorithm to use.  Programmers can start
with a grammar that is convenient (but perhaps slower to parse with),
and gradually modify it to conform to LALR(1) in places for improved
performance.  Grammars that are already LALR(1) will work in Elkhound
unmodified (though the input syntax is different), and with parsing
speeds within a few percent of Bison-generated parsers.

<p>
The reason I wrote Elkhound is to be able to write a C++ parser.
The parser is called Elsa, and is included in the distribution below.

<p>
Elkhound is written in C++, and can generate parsers written in either
C++ or Ocaml.  Elsa is written entirely in C++, and parses C and C++
input code.

<h1>How much C++ can Elsa parse?</h1>

<p>
(Info as of 2005-08-22.)

<p>
Elsa can parse most C++ "in the wild".
It has been tested with some notable large programs,
including <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>,
<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html">ACE</a>,
and itself.  I have not tried parsing
<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> recently, so that's
the next major goal.

<p>
Elsa supports most of the GCC extensions, and several important
GCC bugs.  Currently, gcc-3.4.x is the main compatibility target;
GCC bugs that are fixed in 3.4 are (in most cases) not supported.
It also supports a couple of MSVC bugs, but no extensions (other than
those that overlap with GCC extensions), and no bugs/extensions for
other compilers.  Supported bugs are documented in
<a href="sources/elsa/cc_lang.h">sources/elsa/cc_lang.h</a>.

<p>
Elsa has recently gained the ability to parse all of the gcc-3.4.3
standard library headers (except for <tt>valarray</tt>, which uses
template template parameters).  Previously, the recommended practice
was to
<a href="old-headers.html">preprocess your program using gcc-2.95.3</a>,
but it now should
work to use the 3.x headers, especially 3.4.3 or later.
Unfortunately, the headers that come with gcc-3.3.x and earlier contain
bugs, and Elsa does not currently emulate the gcc bugs that tolerate them.
(Note that the 3.x headers are <em>much</em> more complicated than the
2.x headers, so
they take significantly longer to parse and do template instantiation.)
I have not yet tried the 4.x headers.

<p>
The one major feature that is not implemented at all is template
template parameters and arguments (passing entire, uninstantiated
templates as arguments to other templates).  The only place I have
seen them used is in the <tt>valarray</tt> header; let me know if
this feature is a priority to you.

<p>
Additionally, there are many known "minor" bugs.  See
<a href="sources/elsa/regrtest"><tt>elsa/regrtest</tt></a>
for details.  The known failures are mostly pretty esoteric; in
a few cases, they are (valid) inputs that no front end I know of can handle.

<p>
If you have a program you want to parse, and Elsa fails to, then it is
likely that a small "point fix" can be found quickly to solve the
problem.  Send me a preprocessed .i file if you want help.  Even better,
use <a href="http://delta.tigris.org/">Delta</a> to minimize the
input (such that, say, gcc-3.4 accepts it but Elsa does not).  Sending me
minimized test cases that cause Elsa to fail is the among the best ways
to help me make Elsa better!

<h1>How much C can Elsa parse?</h1>

<p>
Elsa supports parsing C by basically parsing it as C++ and then
applying looser typechecking rules (the details are more complicated,
but that is the basic approach).  This support is enabled with the
"<tt>-tr c_lang</tt>" argument to <tt>ccparse</tt>.

<p>
In C mode, Elsa can parse most C programs, including the Linux kernel
(our highest-priority C program).  It handles most gcc extensions,
including K&amp;R function definitions and the "implicit int" rule.
There is a good chance it will parse your C program.

<p>
However, since Elsa still applies C++ rules in some places in C mode,
Elsa may reject valid but "funky" C programs.  Support for the looser
C rules is being gradually added, and is usually easy to add; let me
know if you want help parsing some C program.

<h1>Relationship between Elsa, Elkhound, and CIL; and Ocaml vs C++</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil/index.html">CIL</a>, the
C Intermediate Language, is a C front-end written in
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/">Ocaml</a>.
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~necula/">George Necula</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~weimer/">Wes Weimer</a> and I wrote
CIL as infrastructure for the
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~necula/ccured/index.html">CCured</a>
("see-cured") project, which is a source-to-source translator for C that
adds run-time checks for memory safety.  CCured is also written in Ocaml.

<p>
Elsa and Elkhound are, at the moment, completely separate from CIL.
I wrote them because our experiments extending CIL to handle C++ were
unsuccessful.  I chose to write them in C++ instead of Ocaml because
I prefer C++; the rest of the group prefers Ocaml, which is why CIL and
CCured use that language instead.

<p>
Long term, I would love to find a good way to merge Elsa and CIL.  At
the very least it should be possible to use Elsa to parse C++ into an
AST, and then feed that to CIL so those that want to can write their
analysis in Ocaml and the rest of the CIL infrastructure.  Even better,
I would like to make it possible to move ASTs back and forth among
several tools (possibly written in different languages), retaining not
just the AST forms but the annotations computed by prior analyses.
There is ongoing effort to export the Elsa AST as an XML document;
we expect to be able to advertise this in the next public release.

Karl Chen, and he and Daniel Wilkerson are doing most of the
maintenance.  The most active page is the

that includes Elsa.  I plan to move the Elsa pages to someplace else
reasonably soon.

    to clarify which function is called, in most contexts
<li>(Elsa) Daniel Wilkerson added an optional elaboration pass to make
    explicit otherwise implicit calls to constructors, destructors,
    and to add definitions of compiler-supplied functions (e.g.
    copy ctor).
<li>(Elsa) implemented namespaces
<li>(Elsa) factor E_this out of E_variable; clarified other 'this' issues
<li>(Elsa) annotate Declarators with their syntactic context, as they appear
    in many places with substantially varying meanings
<li>(Elsa) bugfix: handle ambiguity: "if (C * c = 5) ..."
<li>(Elsa) bugfix: correct scoping for "x" in "if (...) int x = ...;"
<li>(Elkhound) Ocaml backend (see elkhound/ocaml directory)
<li>(Elkhound) misc. portability fixes

</ul>


<p>Major changes in version <a href="rel/elsa-2003.08.16.tar.gz">2003.08.16</a>:
<ul>
<li>(Elkhound) Created a
    <a href="sources/elkhound/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> to help
    get started with Elkhound.  It guides the new user from grammar
    creation through run-time disambiguation.
<li>(Elsa) C++ operator overloading, including some
    gymnastics to handle built-in candidates
    (see <a href="sources/elsa/convertibility.txt">convertibility.txt</a>), 
    is finished.
    It's still not enabled by default, however, because of some unfinished
    parts of overloading generally.
</ul>

<p>Major changes in version <a href="rel/elsa-2003.07.22.tar.gz">2003.07.22</a>:
<ul>       
<li>Incorporated cygwin fixes from Jim Nichols.
<li>(Elkhound) Added very rudimentary error diagnosis: at a parse
    error, the last "parser" to die will print the list of tokens that
    would have allowed it to continue (the expected tokens).
<li>(Elsa) Many minor bug fixes.
<li>(Elsa) Partial implementation of template instantiation.
<li>(Elsa) Implemented modules to do standard conversions, implicit
    conversions, and overload resolution.  Nothing calls into these
    modules, yet, except some testing infrastructure.
<li>(Elsa) Initial operator overloading implementation: when a call to
    an operator function is detected, the AST is rewritten to be as if
    the user used the explicit function call notation.  (So far only
    binary operators are implemented.)
<li>(Elsa) Added some support for GNU and C99 extensions: attributes,
    inline assembly, designated initializers.  It's now close to being
    able to parse all of Linux.
<li>(Elsa) Added a module to compute the control flow graph among the
    statements within a function body.

<ul>
<li>Lots of small enhancements and fixes to the C++ parser.  It's almost
    as fast as g++ now.
<li>Added support for parsing C too.
<li>Rewrote the lexer (the old one was slow and stupid).
<li>Renamed the distribution "Elsa".
<li>Rewrote configure scripts in perl.

    The parser test program is called <tt>cc/ccparse</tt>.
<li>Fixed a bug where keep() wasn't being called in the deterministic
    (ordinary LR) parser core.
</ul>

<p>Major changes in version <a href="rel/elkhound-2002.10.04.tar.gz">2002.10.04</a>:
<ul>

underlying parsing algorithm, and the license under which it is
available.  (GPL=<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU
General Public License</a>, LGPL=<a

<strong>Other C++ Parsers.</strong>  Here are some alternatives to Elsa.  The main
advantages I would claim for Elsa are ease of adding language extensions,
a common activity in a research setting, and reasonably complete support
for the C++ language, especially templates.  (Note that "instantiating"
templates is a necessary part of parsing code that uses templates.)
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU Compiler Collection</a>, aka GCC.
    g++ used a  Bison grammar prior to gcc-3.4.  Starting with gcc-3.4,
    it uses a hand-written recursive-descent parser.  Its parser is more
    mature than Elsa's.  However, gcc is a
    compiler, and its intermediate language may not be ideal for analyses
    other than code generation.  (GPL)
<li><a href="http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Index.html">GCC_XML</a> is an
    extension to GCC to have it emit some of the GCC AST as XML.  Currently
    it does not emit information about function bodies; it records
    global declarations, <tt>struct</tt> contents, etc.  (BSD)
<li>The <a href="http://opencxx.sourceforge.net/">Open C++</a> parser
    was designed to allow run-time extensions, sort of like browser plugins.
    It uses a hand-written recursive-descent parser.  Its handling of
    templates is currently (2005-06-03) less capable than Elsa's.  
    (<a href="http://opencxx.sourceforge.net/credits/">Custom
    license</a>, similar to BSD.)
<li><a href="http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~malloy/projects/keystone/keystone.html">Keystone</a>
    contains a parser written in <a href="http://www.siber.com/btyacc/">BtYacc</a>.
    It does not do template instantiation.  However, the page has some interesting
    papers on the implementation of name lookup.  (GPL)
<li><a href="http://www.edg.com/">Edison Design Group</a> licenses several
    compiler front ends, including a hand-written recursive-descent C++ parser.
    The EDG parser is very robust, and is the only front end I know of that
    implements the entire C++ language, including the <tt>export</tt> keyword.
    Its only drawbacks are the commercial license, which I find to be an
    impediment to research impact, and the difficulty of adding and composing
    extensions, since the parser specification is imperative code instead of
    a grammar.  (Commercial, but academic licensing is possible.)
<li><a href="http://www.empathy.com/pccts/">John Lilley's PCCTS-based C++ Parser</a>
    contains a C++ grammar for PCCTS (predecessor of
    <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>).  It does not appear to have
    been updated since 1997.  (Public domain.)
<li>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> IDE contains a C++ parser.
    However, it is just doing a heuristic best effort without access to
    crucial contextual information from headers, and so will mis-parse some
    syntax.  (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v05.html">Custom license</a>,
    similar to BSD.  OSI-approved version
    <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php">here</a>.)
<li><a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/">KDevelop</a> also contains a C++ parser.
    I have not done much investigation of its capabilities.  (GPL)
<li><a href="http://www.openwatcom.org/">OpenWatcom</a> is an open-source version
    of the Watcom C++ compiler.  The parser is hand-written, recursive-descent.
    (<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/sybase.php">Custom OSI-approved 
    license</a>.)
<li><a href="http://upp.sourceforge.net/">Ultimate++</a> is Windows and Linux
    IDE for C++.  It contains a hand-written recursive-descent C++ parser, 
    comparable to Eclipse's: simple and heuristic, no template instantiation.
    (Custom, vaguely BSD-ish license.)
<li>The <a href="http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/research/dsrg/fog/">FOG -
    Flexible Object Generator</a> contains a metacompiler for C++.  It includes
    a C++ parser based on a backtracking variant of Bison with ad-hoc ambiguity
    resolution, some of which is deferred until semantic analysis (similar to
    Elsa).  I have not attempted to evaluate its completeness.
    <a href="http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/research/dsrg/fog/FogThesis.pdf">Edward
    Willink's PhD thesis</a> describes the design of the parser, and includes
    an interesting discussion of the difficulties of parsing C++ and the resolution
    techniques used in FOG.  (License unknown.)
<li><a href="http://synopsis.fresco.org/index.html">Synopsis</a> contains a
    hand-written parser based on that of OpenC++.  (LGPL)
</ul>


<p>
<strong>GLR Parser generators.</strong>  These are all of the available
systems I know of that use the GLR algorithm.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/htbin/sen1/twiki/bin/view/SEN1/MetaEnvironment">ASF+SDF
    Meta-Environment</a> integrates lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis
    into a single environment and framework.  It uses a scannerless GLR
    parser.  (LGPL)

<li><a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/parsing/tom/0.html">Tom</a>:
    C Implementation of the Tomita (aka GLR) parsing algorithm.  This
    implementation just prints the parse tree and exits.  (Public
    domain)

<li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~harmonia/">Harmonia</a>
    is "an open, extensible framework for constructing interactive,
    language-aware programming tools."  It uses an incremental GLR
    parser.  (Binary-only release at this time.)

<li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/">Elkhound</a>
    is a GLR parser generator.  It tries to be as fast as Bison for
    LALR(1) grammar fragments while also competitive with other GLR
    implementations for nondeterministic portions of input.  (BSD)

<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">Bison</a>,
    as of version 1.50, now includes a GLR parser, implemented
    by <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~hilfingr/">Paul Hilfinger</a>.
    You request it with the <tt>%glr-parser</tt> directive, and further
    documenation is in the <tt>info</tt> files.
    Among my TODOs is to do some experimentation with this implementation.
    (GPL)

<li><a href="http://dparser.sourceforge.net/">DParser</a>
    uses a scannerless GLR implementation.  It supports user-specified
    reduction actions, and includes an example grammar for C.  I haven't
    examined it in detail.  (BSD)

<li><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stse/javac/">Fjavac</a>
    is a Java parser written in Ocaml using the GLR algorithm with
    extensions for ordered productions (for certain kinds of
    disambiguation specifications).  It is part of a larger project
    to formally specify Java.  (License unspecified)

<li><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~megacz/jbp/">JBP</a>,
    the Java Boolean Parser, is a parser generator for Java (the
    generated parser is Java source code) written in Java.  It
    uses a scannerless GLR implementation with support for
    <a href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca/home/okhotin/boolean/">boolean grammars</a>.
    The parser generates a parse tree, rather than supporting arbitrary
    user-defined reduction actions.  (BSD)

</ul>

<p>
<strong>Parser generators based on algorithms other than GLR</strong> but which
support multiple tokens of lookahead (or some other way of handling
nondeterministic grammars):
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.combo.org/accent/">Accent</a> is parser generator
    based on a combination of the Earley and LL parsing algorithms.  (GPL)

<li><a href="http://www.siber.com/btyacc/">BtYacc</a> (backtracking
    YACC) is based on YACC, but adds support for backtracking.  Thus,
    it allows for unbounded lookahead, but does not allow ambiguity to
    be retained after parsing.  (Public domain)

<li><a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> is an LL(k) parser generator
    with built-in lexical analyzer.  (Public domain)

<li><a href="http://www.afm.sbu.ac.uk/precc/">PRECC</a> (PREttier Compiler
    Compiler) is an LL(infinity) parser generator.  (Custom license;
    source is available; see its <tt>license.doc</tt> file.)

</ul>

<p>
<strong>Parser generators that use deterministic algorithms</strong> (e.g. LALR(1) or
LL(1)).  Since there are many such generators available, I attempt
here only to list those that are popular, actively maintained, or
otherwise relevant to Elkhound or the compiler community at large.
Also, I'm only listing those with C language interfaces (more or less
arbitrary decision, to cut down on the size).
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">Bison</a>
    is a very popular LALR(1) parser generator.  (GPL)

<li><a href="http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/">YACC</a> (Yet Another
    Compiler-Compiler) was among the first widely-used parser generators,
    in part because it was distributed with early versions of UNIX.  It
    generates LALR(1) parsers.  (Availability/license unknown)

<li><a href="http://www.parsifalsoft.com/">AnaGram</a> is an LALR(1)
    parser generator with some support for built-in lexical analysis.
    It also has several accompanying tools for grammar debugging.
    (Commercial)

<li><a href="http://www.programmar.com/main.shtml">ProGrammar</a>
    is another parser generator with accompanying tools to help
    development.  I can't tell from their website what parsing
    algorithm it uses.  (Commerical)

<li><a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/">Lemon</a> is an LALR(1)
    parser generator that claims to be faster than Bison.  It
    supports "nonterminal destructors", which are similar to
    Elkhound's <tt>del()</tt> actions.  (GPL)
