<b><font size=+1><a name=Q1></A>Q1. What is the Current Version?<BR>

A1. Electronic Version: June, 1995 . . . BUT LOOK!</font></b>
<blockquote>
There's now <a href ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fudlatest.html">an
updated file of my latest thoughts on Fudge</a>, as of April 5,
2000.<P>

<b>The Grey Ghost Games printed version</b>: May 2000. The <a href
="http://www.fudgerpg.com/fudge/#expanded"><i>Fudge Expanded
Edition</i></a> contains essentially the same text as the June 1995 electronic
version, with:
<ul>
<li>some minor updates to reflect some of my "latest thoughts
on <i><b>Fudge</b></i>," and
<li>some additional characters added to <i>Chapter 6, Tips &
Examples</i>.
</ul>
The <b><i>Expanded</i></b> part of the book includes
<ul>
<li>"<i>What's Fudge?</i>" (a
collection of responses from <i><b>Fudge</b></i> fans to the question,
"What is <i><b>Fudge</b></i>
to you?"),
<li>"<i>Fudge in a Nutshell</i>," and
<li>"<i>Fantasy Fudge</i>."
</ul>


<b><i>Fantasy Fudge</i></b> is a pre-customized, ready-to-run
version of <i><b>Fudge</b></i> by Ann Dupuis.  It features
choices made for the GM in character creation (based on my <a
href ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fudfive.html"><i>Five Point
Fudge</i></a> easy character creation system), action resolution,
and character development.  It also includes:
<ul>
<li>some sample characters,
<li>a fantasy adventure, and
<li>a bestiary.
</ul>

You can use this for your first few games of <b><i>Fudge</i></b> without
having to define rules for yourself.  Once you've got this system under
your belt, you can easily see how to customize <b><i>Fudge</i></b>
to your own tastes - nice work, Ann!<P>

All this in a professionally typeset and illustrated book you can fondle.

<b><font size=+1><a name=Q2></A>Q2. What is Fudge?<BR>

A2. <i><b>Fudge</i></b> is a free role-playing game . . .</font></b>
<blockquote>
. . . (face-to-face table gaming, that is - not a computer game or Live
Roleplaying Game). It is just a gaming &#8220;engine&#8221; - each
GM must provide the &#8220;body&#8221; of the RPG in order to make
it work. A certain amount of customization work is necessary in
order to use <i><b>Fudge</b></i>, and many things are left unstated:
the GM will have to fudge a lot.


<ul>
<li> <b>No fixed attributes</b> - the GM chooses attributes appropriate
to the campaign.
<li> <b>Skill-driven system</b>, with sample expandable skill list
included.
<li> <b>Word-based traits and action resolution</b> make it easy to know
just how good any character is at anything. This also allows
<i><b>Fudge</b></i> to be a &#8220;universal translator&#8221; between gaming systems.
<li> <b>Simple action resolution system</b>. <i><b>Fudge</b></i> is very easy to run
no matter what the genre - no tables to look up.
<li> <b>It's easy to import good mechanics</b> from your favorite game
into <i><b>Fudge</b></i>.
</ul>

<i><b>Fudge</b></i> can, if you want, stand for:
<i>moteur de jeu non directif et universel &agrave; faire vous-m&ecirc;me</i><P>
Or, in English:<P>
<ul>
<li><b>Freeform</b> (simple, laid-back, not rules-heavy.)
<li><b>Universal</b> (usable with any genre.)
<li><b>Do-it-yourself</b> (customizable to taste.)
<li><b>Gaming</b> (role-playing gaming, that is.)
<li><b>Engine</b> (it's just the basic mechanism for character creation
and development, as well as action resolution. No
world details are provided.)<p>
</ul>

Or it can just stand for the fact the GM will have to fudge a lot of
rules - this was, in fact, the origin of the name.  The acronym came
later, and thus I now prefer the name to be spelled with only the first
letter capitalized.<P>

<i><b>Fudge</b></i> was written by, and is copyright by, Steffan O'Sullivan.
Much valuable aid was received from many people on
rec.games.design, most of whom are credited in the actual <i><b>Fudge</b></i>
manuscript.<P>

You can read <a href ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fud-des.html">the
Designer's Notes</a> if you have any interest in the history and design
goals of <b><i>Fudge</i></b>.

<b><font size=+1><a name=Q3></A>Q3. Who is the target audience?<BR>
A3. <i><b>Fudge</b></i> is for experienced GMs . . .</font></b>
<blockquote>
. . . though it can be used with novice or experienced players. You must
enjoy making decisions on the fly in order to run <i><b>Fudge</b></i> -
it's rules-light. It's also not for those who want extreme detail. You
must enjoy either creating or adapting your own world background, as
none is provided (but sample characters from a number of genres are
included).



<HR ALIGN=center  WIDTH=100% SIZE=2>

</blockquote>
<b><font size=+1><a name=Q4></A>Q4. What genres is it for?<BR>
A4. Any . . .</font></b>
<blockquote>
. . . of course, it hasn't yet been tried with <i>every</i> possible
genre, so only time will tell if it really works with any genre.
So far, it works for every genre tried (and we've tried some wild ones!),
though not to everyone's tastes, of course - that would be impossible.


<HR ALIGN=center  WIDTH=100% SIZE=2>

<b><font size=+1><a name=Q5></A>Q5. Where can I get it?<BR>

A5. You can buy a copy from:</font></b>
<blockquote>

...the good folks at Grey Ghost Press, though they'd prefer you to ask
for it at your local retail store (and you save the shipping cost).
The Fudge Expanded Edition version is a 128-page paperback book
including the basic rules, the addenda, "Fantasy Fudge," and some
additional materials. The price is $19.95.  Order at your local
retail shop or from the Grey Ghost Games web site:<br> <a Href
="http://www.fudgerpg.com">http://www.fudgerpg.com</a><p>

They also sell <i><b>Fudge</b></i> dice (recommended - see <A HREF="#Q8">Q8</A>) - enquire if interested.

<b><font size=+1><a name=Q7></A>Q7. Can I post or otherwise publish Fudge-based articles?<BR>

A7. Yes! I even like it when you do!</font></b>
<blockquote>

You can contribute alternate rules, or an adventure setting, or
whatever.  If you've got a web page, put all the <b><i>Fudge</i></b> material you
want on it - the more the better.  Just be sure to include the &#8220;About
<i><b>Fudge</b></i>&#8221; and &#8220;Disclaimer&#8221; sections
of the <a href ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fudlegal.html"><i>Fudge</i>
legal notice</a>, and it's legal!<P>

And be sure to <a
href="http://www.panix.com/~sos/cgi-bin/safemail.cgi?user=sos&domain=panix.com">notify
me</a> so I can add a link to it from my web page.  You might also want
to <a
href="http://www.panix.com/~sos/cgi-bin/safemail.cgi?user=webmaster&domain=fudgerpg.com">notify
the Grey Ghost webmaster</a> for a link from their resources page.
See <a href ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/fudge.html">my <b><i>Fudge</i></b> page</a>
or <a href ="http://www.fudgerpg.com/fudge/resources.html">the Grey
Ghost <b><i>Fudge</i></b> resources page</a> for many examples of what others
have done.  <P>

If you don't have a web page, consider submitting your work to <a
href ="http://www.fudgefactor.org">Fudge Factor</a>, a webzine
devoted to <b><i>Fudge</i></b> - check it out!<P>

If you want to sell your work, you need a royalty-free license from
me - see the <a href
="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fudlic.html">Application for a
Commercial
License</a> for details.<P>

In addition, Grey Ghost Press is seeking creative, quality
<i><b>Fudge</b></i> sourcebooks to publish - with royalties for the
author. While the basic <b><i>Fudge</i></b> rules will always be freely
copyable, authors published through Grey Ghost Press may choose to retain
their copyrights. Currently, Grey Ghost Press is soliciting small-
to medium-sized tidbits and articles for two upcoming sourcebooks; a
"mega-Addenda" for <b><i>Fudge</i></b>, and "Friend or Foe," a sourcebook
for gamemasters looking for help in populating their game worlds. Contact
Grey Ghost Press at <a href ="http://www.fudgerpg.com/fudge/#write">this
web link</a> for more information.<P>

And finally, you can become a <I><b>Fudge</b></I> publisher yourself!
That's right - you can publish supplements for <I><b>Fudge</b></I>
(though not the basic book) and even charge money for them!  If you do,
though, you'll need to get a royalty-free license from the author -
read the <a href ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fudlic.html"><I>Fudge</I>
Licensing Instructions</a> and follow the directions.

<b><font size=+1><a name=Q8></A>Q8. What's this about <i><b>Fudge Dice</i></b>
or 4d3?<BR>

A8. Special d3s are now available from Grey Ghost Games . .
.</font></b>
<blockquote>
 . . . but you don't need them to play the game.  You can use regular
D6s or d10s.  Some people think <I><b>Fudge Dice</b></I> make it easier to play, though.  A <I><b>Fudge Die</b></I> is
actually a d6, with two faces containing a plus sign (+), two
faces containing a minus sign (-), and two faces blank. Each plus
represents +1, each minus -1, and each blank 0. Rolling 4 of
these dice gives a lovely distribution of results from -4 to +4,
with easy to figure math, and no table. In addition, they are
very flexible, allowing other uses, such as as a damage roll, and
as dice in other games. Contact Grey Ghost Games if interested:
<a
href="http://www.panix.com/~sos/cgi-bin/safemail.cgi?user=ghostgames&domain=fudgerpg.com">ghostgames at fudgerpg.com</A> or use their <a

<b><font size=+1><a name=Q9></A>Q9. Are there any known errata?<BR>
A9. Sadly, there are . . .</font></b>
<blockquote>

... but none that we know of yet in the new <B><I>Fudge Expanded
Edition</i></b>! <P>

But if you have the older print edition or online
edition ...<P>

... while there are minor typos,
they are for the most part insignificant. The three errata that
could be confusing are:
<p>
The first sentence in Section 3.5, Opposed Actions. This should read:<P>
&#8220;To resolve an Opposed action between two characters, each side
makes a normal <i><b>Fudge</b></i> dice roll against the appropriate
trait and announces the result.&#8221;<p>

In section 4.54, there are two references to &#8220;Section 4.68.&#8221;
There is no Section 4.68, so I suppose that could be confusing.
Change these to &#8220;Section 4.58.&#8221;<p>

The <a href ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fudlegal.html">Fudge Legal
Notice</a> has been changed.  Specifically, the <b>DISCLAIMER</b>
section, which now grants more assurance to a writer of derivative
works that such works can be copyrighted by the author.  If you have
an electronic version of <i><b>Fudge</b></i>, please update the legal
notice with the new <B>DISCLAIMER</b> section.  Thank you!<P>

<b><font size=+1><a name=Q10></A>Q10. Where can I discuss Fudge?<BR>

A10. Usenet discussion should be on rec.games.frp.misc . . .</font></b>
<blockquote>

Or rec.games.frp.moderated.<P>

<i><b>Fudge</b></i> is a
genuine RPG, and deserves to be discussed there. Simply put the
the word <i><b>Fudge</b></i> in the subject line and have fun! If you really
want to do a major redesign of some section of <i><b>Fudge</b></i>, you might
try posting to rec.games.design.<p>

There is also a <i><b>Fudge</b></i> mailing list, maintained by
Carl D. Cravens. To subscribe to fudge-l, send an e-mail message to
<a href ="mailto:fudge-on@phoenyx.net">fudge-on@phoenyx.net</a>.<p>

Messages meant for the mailing list itself should be sent to
fudge@phoenyx.net.  Once you are subscribed to the list, you control
the features of the list at the web page <a href
="http://www.phoenyx.net/fudge">http://www.phoenyx.net/fudge</a>.
Shortly, Carl will have a web page online with more information about
the list, and presumably an archive as well.

<b><font size=+1><a name=Q11></A>Q11. What other Fudge products are available?<BR>

A11. Quite a few items, and growing all the time!</font></b>
<blockquote>
    There are actually too many for me to list and hopefully too
    many for me to keep up with.  So rather than attempt that here,
    I have instead, on my regular <b><i>Fudge</i></b> page, <a href
    ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/fudge.html#commerce">a list of
    Commercial Fudge publishers</a> which you should check.  Check
    all their websites to see what's new!<P>

   As a service to <a href ="http://www.fudgerpg.com">Grey Ghost
Games</a> for being the official publishers of <b><i>Fudge</i></b>
itself, I'll try to keep up with their ambitious schedule.  Check
their web site to be sure, but at this point they've also published
some complete worldbooks (no customization required) as well as a
magic supplement and some adventures:<P>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Gatecrasher</i></b>
<li> <b><i>Magical Medley</i></b>
<li><b><i>Another Fine Mess</i></b>
<li><b><i>Terra Incognita</i></b>
<li><b><i>Santa's Secret</i></b>
<li><b><i>Fudge Dice &amp; Dice Bags</i></b>
</ul>


</blockquote>
<b><font size=+1><a name=Q12></A>Q12. Is Fudge a complete RPG?<BR>

A12. Yes, of course it is!  But there's some assembly required.</font></b>
<blockquote>
      However, I'll grant you that you have to shift your idea of
      what an RPG is in order to believe that.  But I assure you
      that it has all you <b>need</b> to run a game.  You'll have
      to make some choices and do some thinking, but you won't have
      to construct a game or make up or collect rules from other
      games - all you need is included.<P>

      I admit some people (one or two of them even intelligent)
      contest this view of <b><i>Fudge</i></b>.  But it's just
      semantics - we just disagree on some basic definitions.  If
      you wish, you can read <a href
      ="http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/fudcomplete.html">my rant</a>
      on this (it can't really be called anything else).
      <b>Warning</b>: there are references to bodily wastes in this
      file - if this bothers you, even though the references are
      oddly appropriate, don't read it!<P>
