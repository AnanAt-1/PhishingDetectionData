                    aspects of Celtic art although it&#146;s a relatively late

                      the Bronze Age forward Celtic art embodies a very well-developed 
                      use of form. This is especially evident in the curved and 
                      sweeping shapes Celtic craftsmen delighted in creating - 
                      sometimes abstract, sometimes stylized from plant or animal 
                      forms. The exact point at which this mastery of line and 
                      shape first adopted interlace as its main expression is 
                      not clear, though it probably developed between the early 
                      christian period and the seventh century C.E.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                    early Celtic church diverged very markedly from christianity 
                    as practiced on the continent. Its manifestaion as a loosely 
                    organized community of monastic orders or communes in the 
                    wilderness reflects not only pagan Celtic tradition (in which 
                    groves and springs were sacred places) but also resembles 
                    the early christian society of North Africa. Interlace was 
                    used by the Coptic communities in North Africa, though it 
                    was never developed there so well as it did in the British 
                    Isles. It is possible that it was this heretical link which 
                    brought knotwork to the islands where it was to become known 
                    universally as &quot;Celtic Interlace&quot;; but on the other 
                    hand, this type of ornament is native to many parts of the 
                    world, including China, so there&#146;s also the possibility 
                    that it developed locally.</font></p>

                    influence, less well understood, is is that of the Picts in 
                    what is now Scotland and northern England. These are a people 
                    slighted by history, often portayed as naked stone-age fellows 
                    chipping flints in their burrows: in fact there seem to have 
                    been organized and powerful kingdoms of these Coritani or 
                    Cruithne well into the ninth century, able to withstand the 
                    many waves of invaders who came to their territories. Their 
                    stone monuments are among the most excellent examples, both 
                    in design and craftsmanship, of interlace and animal ornament. 
                    While the period references for a study of the Picts are inconclusiveone 
                    can still hope that we&#146;ll know more about them one day.</font></p>

                    were also strong related traditions for decoration in Scandinavia. 
                    A recurring motif in early Saxon and Scandinavian art is the 
                    gripping beast, and bands of interlaced ornament are also 
                    frequently found in those parts.</font></p>

                    important to remember the nature of the age in which this 
                    art form became dominant in Celtic culture. Between the sixth 
                    and eighth centuries, there was a prolonged and brutal collision 
                    of British, Irish, Pictish and Scandinavian peoples in northern 
                    Britain. During the seventh century these four cultures wrestled 
                    for territory with such violence that all contemporary local 
                    records simply cease - for years. In the generations following 
                    this period it&#146;s apparent that after the wars there was 
                    a cross-fertilization of these cultures that may have resulted 
                    in what we now call Celtic Interlace as well as other developments 
                    including the creation of the frame harp, strung with horsehair 
                    or wire.</font></p>

                      it arrived in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, the Celtic peoples 
                      lost no time in perfecting interlaced knotwork. This style 
                      of decoration appeared in metalwork, carved stones, textiles, 
                      and, ultimately, in illuminated manuscripts such as the 
                      Books of Kells, Lindisfarne, and Durrow, in which some see 
                      the highest expression of Celtic art. By the time these 
                      manuscripts were made, the Irish ecclesiastics were on familiar 
                      terms with the Saxons of England. Many young Saxons travelled 
                      to Ireland to be educated (the Welsh wouldn&#146;t have 
                      them; in fact, the Welsh christians didn&#146;t even want 
                      to convert them, since they&#146;d then have to share their 
                      Heaven with the Saxons as well as their Earth). If it hadn&#146;t 
                      arrived before, this is probably the origin of the &quot;gripping 
                      beast&quot; in Celtic art - the ancestor of the designs

                  <p><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
                    have been various suggestions that interlace patterns form 
                    a sort of language. In the literal sense this is probably 
                    not true. Such a tradition would almost have to predate christianity, 
                    which brought its own form of literacy to the Isles. Not only 
                    is that unlikely due to the physical evidence, but even if 
                    it were so the Druidic and Scandinavian traditions alike avoided 
                    the use of written language for most purposes; our word &quot;spell&quot;, 
                    which means both to write a thing or to enchant it, is a Saxon 
                    word that demonstrates how seriously these people took the 
                    act of writing - a creative act tied to the magic of poetry 
                    and to pure enchantment itself. One can&#146;t describe as 
                    &quot;illiterate&quot; a people to whom education meant the 
                    memorization of hundreds of stories, geneaologies, and poems; 
                    in fact the ancient Irish used several hundred poetic metres 
                    and variations alone, which a bard or filidh had to learn; 
                    but &quot;literacy&quot; in the literal sense of &quot;writing&quot; 
                    wasn&#146;t in their curriculum. Any of us, in this age of 
                    printing and now of electronic data transmission, would be 
                    unlikely to master that sort of mental training - but writing, 
                    and specifically the use of knotwork as a means of writing, 
                    looks very unlikely as a branch of Celtic learning.</font></p>

                    idea, proposed by <a
        href="#cargill">John Cargill</a>*, is that Celtic knotwork was in some 
                    cases a form of musical notation. To my knowledge no one has 
                    pursued this idea further, but it&#146;s an interesting one; 
                    basically he believed that a limited number of the stone carvings 
                    in Scotland used a particular freeform type of interlace to 
                    record musical scores.</font></p>

                      own belief is that interlace embodies one idea. It is the 
                      same basic premise of cartomancy, of astrology, indeed of 
                      all forms of divination: that all things proceed from one 
                      substance, and that all things are composed of various embodiments 
                      of that one thing - a substance, or energy, or conciousness, 
                      whose sentient elements turn and contort themselves is an 
                      effort to see the entire pattern of which they are a part. 
                      In this view the knots and patterns of interlace represent 
                      the complicated whole of creation as the embodiment of one

                    Bain&#146;s book is a valuable atlas of surviving examples 
                    of Celtic interlace, spiral designs and fretwork. There are
