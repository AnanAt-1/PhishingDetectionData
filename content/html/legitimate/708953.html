<h1>Port and starboard explained</h1>
<p><b>Port</b> and <b>starboard</b> are <a href="../Glossary_of_nautical_terms_(M-Z)/" title="Glossary of nautical terms is an alphabetical listing of terms and expressions connected with ships, shipping, seamanship ...">nautical</a> terms for <a href="../watercraft/" title="A watercraft is any vehicle designed for travel across or through water bodies, such as a boat, ship, hovercraft, ...">watercraft</a> and <a href="../spacecraft/" title="A spacecraft is a vehicle that is designed to fly and operate in outer space.">spacecraft</a>, referring respectively to the left and right sides of the vessel, when aboard and facing the <a href="../Bow_(watercraft)/" title="The bow is the forward part of the hull of a ship or boat, the point that is usually most forward when the vessel is underway.">bow</a> (front).</p>
<p>Vessels with bilateral <a href="../Symmetry_(geometry)/" title="Symmetry is an operation or transformation that maps the figure/object onto itself.">symmetry</a> have left and right halves which are <a href="../mirror_image/" title="A mirror image is a reflected duplication of an object that appears almost identical, but is reversed in the direction ...">mirror image</a>s of each other. One asymmetric feature is where access to a boat, ship, or aircraft is at the side; it is usually only on the port side (hence the name).</p>
<h2>Side</h2>
<p>Port side and starboard side respectively refer to the left and right sides of the vessel, when aboard and facing the bow. The port and starboard sides of the vessel always refer to the same portion of the vessel's structure, and do not depend on the position of someone aboard the vessel.</p>
<p>The port side is the side to the left of an observer aboard the vessel and, towards the direction the vessel is heading when <a href="../underway/" title="Underway is a nautical term describing the state of a vessel which is unconstrained from horizontal translational movement ...">underway</a> in the forward direction. The starboard side is to the right of such an observer.<sup><a href="#Ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>This convention allows orders and information to be communicated unambiguously, without needing to know which way any particular crew member is facing.<sup><a href="#Ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The term <i>starboard</i> derives from the <a href="../Old_English_language/" title="Old English was the earliest recorded form of the English language, spoken in England and southern and eastern Scotland in ...">Old English</a> <i>steorbord</i>, meaning the side on which the ship is steered. Before ships had <a href="../rudder/" title="A rudder is a primary control surface used to steer a ship, boat, submarine, hovercraft, airship, or other vehicle that ...">rudder</a>s on their centrelines, they were steered with a <a href="../steering_oar/" title="The steering oar is an over-sized oar or board, to control the direction of a ship or other watercraft prior to the ...">steering oar</a> at the <a href="../stern/" title="The stern is the back or aft -most part of a ship or boat, technically defined as the area built up over the sternpost, ...">stern</a> of the ship on the right hand side of the ship, because more people are <a href="../right-handed/" title="Handedness is an individual&#39;s preferential use of one hand, known as the dominant hand, due to it being stronger, faster or ...">right-handed</a>.<sup><a href="#Ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The "steer-board" etymology is shared by the <a href="../German_language/">German</a> <i>Steuerbord,</i> <a href="../Dutch_language/" title="Dutch Language was used in the Dutch East Indies by a limited educated elite of around 2% of the total population, ...">Dutch</a> <i>stuurboord</i> and <a href="../Swedish_language/">Swedish</a> <i>styrbord</i>, which gave rise to the <a href="../French_language/">French</a> <i>tribord</i>, <a href="../Italian_language/">Italian</a> <i>tribordo,</i> <a href="../Catalan_language/">Catalan</a> <i>estribord</i>, <a href="../Portuguese_language/">Portuguese</a> <i>estibordo</i>, <a href="../Spanish_language/">Spanish</a> <i>estribor</i> and <a href="../Estonian_language/">Estonian</a> <i>tüürpoord</i>.</p>
<p>Since the steering oar was on the right side of the boat, it would tie up at the <a href="../wharf/" title="A wharf is connected to the shore along its full length.">wharf</a> on the other side. Hence the left side was called <i>port</i>.<sup><a href="#Ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The <i><a href="../Oxford_English_Dictionary/" title="The Oxford English Dictionary is the principal historical dictionary of the English language, published by Oxford University ...">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i> cites <i>port</i> in this usage since 1543.<sup><a href="#Ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Formerly, <i>larboard</i> was often used instead of <i>port</i>. This is from <a href="../Middle_English/" title="Middle English is a form of the English language that was spoken after the Norman Conquest of 1066, until the late 15th century.">Middle English</a> <i>ladebord</i> and the term <i>lade</i> is related to the modern <i>load</i>.<sup><a href="#Ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <i>Larboard</i> sounds similar to <i>starboard</i> and in 1844 the <a href="../Royal_Navy/" title="The Royal Navy is the naval warfare force of the United Kingdom, British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, and a ...">Royal Navy</a> ordered that <i>port</i> be used instead.<sup><a href="#Ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Ref-7">[7]</a></sup> The United States Navy followed suit in 1846.<sup><a href="#Ref-8">[8]</a></sup> <i>Larboard</i> continued to be used well into the 1850s by <a href="../whaler/" title="A whaler is a specialized vessel, designed or adapted for whaling : the catching or processing of whales.">whaler</a>s.<sup><a href="#Ref-9">[9]</a></sup> In chapter 12 of <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> (1883) Mark Twain writes <i>larboard</i> to refer to the left side of the ship (<a href="../Steamboats_of_the_Mississippi/">Mississippi River steamboat</a>) in his days on the river – circa 1857–1861.<sup><a href="#Ref-10">[10]</a></sup> Lewis Carroll rhymed <i>larboard</i> and <i>starboard</i> in "Fit the Second" of <i><a href="../The_Hunting_of_the_Snark/" title="The The Hunting of the Snark is a poem by the English writer Lewis Carroll.">The Hunting of the Snark</a></i> (1876).<sup><a href="#Ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>An Anglo-Saxon record of a voyage by <a href="../Ohthere_of_H%c3%a5logaland/" title="Ohthere of H&#229;logaland was a Viking Age Norwegian seafarer known only from an account of his travels that he gave to King ...">Ohthere of Hålogaland</a> used the word "bæcbord" ("back-board") for the left side of a ship. With the steering rudder on the starboard side the man on the rudder had his back to the bagbord (Nordic for portside) side of the ship. The words for "port side" in other European languages, such as German <i>Backbord</i>, Dutch and Afrikaans <i>bakboord</i>, Swedish <i>babord</i>, Spanish <i>babor</i>, Portuguese <i> bombordo</i>, Italian <i>babordo</i>, French <i>bâbord</i> and Estonian <i>pakpoord</i>, are derived from the same root.</p>
<h2>Importance of standard terms</h2>
<p>The navigational treaty convention, the <a href="../International_Regulations_for_Preventing_Collisions_at_Sea/">International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea</a>—for instance, as appears in the UK's Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations 1996 (and comparable US documents from the <a href="../US_Coast_Guard/" title="The United States Coast Guard is the maritime security, search and rescue, and law enforcement service branch of the United ...">US Coast Guard</a>)<sup><a href="#Ref-12">[12]</a></sup> —sets forth requirements for maritime vessels to avoid collisions, whether by sail or powered, and whether a vessel is overtaking, approaching head-on, or crossing.<sup><a href="#Ref-12">[12]</a></sup> To set forth these navigational rules, the terms starboard and port are essential, and to aid in <i><a href="../in_situ/">in situ</a></i> decision-making, the two sides of each vessel are marked, dusk to dawn, by <a href="../navigation_light/" title="A navigation light is a source of illumination on a watercraft, aircraft or spacecraft, meant to give information on the ...">navigation light</a>s, the vessel's starboard side by green and its port side by red.<sup><a href="#Ref-12">[12]</a></sup> <a href="../Aircraft/" title="An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air.">Aircraft</a> are lit in the same way.</p>
<h2>Other nautical uses</h2>
<p>Port and starboard are also commonly used when dividing crews; for example with a two <a href="../watchkeeping/" title="Watchkeeping is the assignment of sailor s to specific roles on a ship to operate it continuously.">watch</a> system the teams supplying the personnel are often named Port and Starboard. This may extend to entire crews, such as the forward-deployed crews of the Royal Navy’s <a href="../Persian_Gulf/" title="The Persian Gulf is a mediterranean sea in West Asia.">Gulf</a>-based frigate, <sup><a href="#Ref-13">[13]</a></sup> or <a href="../ballistic_missile_submarines/" title="A ballistic missile submarine is a submarine capable of deploying submarine-launched ballistic missile s with nuclear ...">ballistic missile submarines</a>.</p>
