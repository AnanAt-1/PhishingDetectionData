<P>The symbols of Trebnje are prescribed by Statutory Decision <I>Statutarni sklep o uporabi grba in zastave Ob&#x0107;ine Trebnje</I>, adopted on 28 January 2009 and published on 13 February 2009 in the official Slovene gazette <I>Uradni list Republike Slovenije</I>, No. 11.<BR>
During its 9th Session held on 28 January 2009 (<A HREF="http://www.trebnje.si/sl/core_articles/302">material</A>), the Municipal Council adopted the symbols of the Local Community (municipal subdivision) of Trebnje as its own, following the procedure that was described in details in the materials (public discussion, citizen's proposals, Local Community's proposal). This was, in fact, simply a confirmation of what was already <A HREF="#ffl">occasionally done</A> in practice - with minor changes to the graphical layout of the symbols.</P>

<P>The Decision says: "The flag of Trebnje is white, in the centre of it is the attribute from the municipal <A HREF="#coa">coat of arms</A>. The edges of the flag are outlined with yellow (golden) colour."<BR>
The more detailed description states that the flag proportions are 1:2.5, that is 2:5, that there is the attribute from the coat of arms in the centre of it and that there are yellow edges; the attribute should be in height a maximum of 1/3 of the hoist size. Horizontal and vertical flags are prescribed, with the attribute properly rotated.<BR>
Although the decision describes the flag as having the "attribute of
the municipal coat of arms" in the middle, the complete coat of arms is set on the flag. Although the
flag is prescribed with proportions 2:5, in both horizontal and
vertical versions, the <A HREF="http://www.trebnje.si/sl/core_web/grb-in-zastava">municipal website</A> and photos of flags in use in the local magazine <A HREF="http://www.trebnje.si/sl/core_web/glasilo-obcanov"><I>Glasilo ob&#x0107;anov</I></A>  show the flag with proportions 1:2.<BR>
Although the coat of arms is prescribed to be not larger than 1/3 of the flag's width, the actual flag has its more like 2/3.</P>

<P><B>Coat of arms of Trebnje</B> - Image by <I>&#x017D;eljko Heimer</I>, 13 November 2012</P>

<P>The coat of arms is prescribed in the aforenmentioned Decision as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The coat of arms of Trebnje is made of a shield in late Gothic shape, on its left and right colored blue and with a green stripe in the middle; in the lower third of the shield are along a horizontal line two green
semicircles on the left and right, and in the middle a similar, blue
semicircle downwards. In the upper third of the shield is a lion
couchant golden-yellow looking to the right. The coat of arms is ornamented
(outlined) with yellow (golden) color, so are the semicircles and the green field outlined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>According to the description, blue represents the sky, trees and streams, green represents fields, hills and vineyards, and the central horizontal and middle stripes forme a letter "T" for "Trebnje". The lion represents the power of an ancient Roman military fort - and the status of the town of Trebnje.</P>

<P><B>Former flag and arms of Trebnje</B> - Image by <I>&#x017D;eljko Heimer</I>, 15 June 2006</P>

<P>The former flag of Trebnje is a vertical flag with the former coat of arms in the middle, as shown by different sources, including the <A HREF="http://www.trebnje.si/si/turizem/znamenitosti/15ti_poldnevnik/default.html">15E Meridian Monument</A> in Trebnje (page no longer online) and the local gazette <I>Glasilo Ob&#x010D;anov</I></A>, May 2004.<BR>
A photo of the flags flying on the town hall (<A HREF="http://www.trebnje.si/File/glasiloobcanov/glasilotrebnje_42_1266489149.pdf"><I>Glasilo Ob&#x010D;anov</I></A>, No. 42, 28 August 2009) confirms that the flag was still used at the time. In subsequent issues of <I>Glasilo Ob&#x010D;anov</I> (No. 55, September 2010; No. 56, October 2010), the flag of the Local Community of Trebnje is to be seen on photos in use both indoors and outdoors. I presume that these are flags that were in existence and were not yet replaced by the new design. The new flag with golden outline appeasr as a table flag in No. 71 (March 2012) and, as an outdoors full-sized flag, in No. 72 (April 2012).</P>

<P>The former coat of arms of Trebnje is vertically divided in three vertical stripes blue-green-blue with three semicircles in lower parts countercharged and a golden lion couchant in chief.<BR>
This is the arms of the previous Local Community of Trebnje, that is of the town of Trebnje proper.</P>

<P>The coat of arms of the Local Community of Trebnje was adopted on 2 March 1992, following a public competition won by the architect Nives Kopriv&#x0161;ek.<BR>
Article 18 of the 2009 Decision allows the Local Community of Trebnje to keep using these symbols.</P>

<P>Stani&#x010D; &amp; Jakopi&#x010D; <A HREF="bib-j0a.html#j2s05">[j2s05]</A> present proposals of flag and arms of Trebnje that were apparently considered for adoption in 1997, to no avail.<BR>
The proposed flag is horizontally divided green-yellow with the coat of arms in the middle.</P>

<P>The original proposal for the coat of arms was designed by
Bogdan Breznik, as "Per fess vert a griffin rampant or langued and armed gules and or semee of honeycomb sable".<BR>
To this was soon added on the request of the local councillors a
pyramid per fess argent and vert to represent the anti-tank block
used in the War of Independence in 1991 and a feather gules to
represent the local writers.<BR>
The honeycomb should represent the long tradition of beekeeping in
the region whereas the green field with the griffin is taken from the coat of arms of Lady Hema, a ruler of the region in 11th century.</P>
