  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">By the end of World War I, the oil industry
  had become a large and fantastically profitable business which
  in part had replaced in influence other industrial interests
  dominating American Politics.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  A key player in this game was Edward L. Doheny, a man whose vast
  holdings in both the United States and Mexico caused his only
  son to play significant and tragic role in its history.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Edward Laurence Doheny, Jr. was born in Los Angeles on November
  1893 and he graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1912. He
  went to Stanford University for one semester and transferred
  to the University of Southern California in January 1913. He
  married his wife and the mother of his five children in June
  1913. He graduated from the University of Southern California
  with a degree in business in 1916. He then joined his father's
  many companies. He was at an executive capacity with the ultimate
  purpose being to succeed to the presidency upon his father's
  retirement.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Doheny, Sr. had first worked as a government surveyor in Kansas
  and New Mexico. He prospected for gold, leaving a long time friend
  and business partner, Albert Bacon Fall.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  In 1890, he came to San Bernardino, California and met another
  acquaintance and business associate who prospered with him in
  the early oil industry, Charles A. Canfield.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  They formed the Pacific and Silver Extracting Company.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The story is told how one day Doheny was sitting in front of
  a Los Angeles hotel thinking about his future when he spotted
  a wagon coming down the street loaded with a dark tar like material.
  He asked the driver what it was and the driver said it was &quot;brea&quot;;
  it was used for fuel at a local ice plant. Doheny contacted Canfield
  and the two set out to find the source of the &quot;black gold&quot;
  which was at the La Brea Tar Pits. Thereupon he entered in numerous
  leases and sank a shaft at the corner of Second and Glendale
  Street in Los Angeles, bringing in his first gusher in November
  of 1892.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Subsequently Doheny had 81 wells in Los Angeles and he began
  to inquire other properties in Fullerton and in the San Joaquin
  Valley including the Coalinga Fields near Bakersfield.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  He soon became a major player in the petroleum business and within
  a few years he went into petroleum production and refining in
  a big way in Mexico where he brought in the greatest gusher in
  history. At one time, he was so powerful that, to protect his
  oil properties in Mexico he had a private army of 6000 men and
  with the outbreak of World War I he persuaded President Wilson
  to send a squadron of destroyers to protect his interests there
  in the Yucatan Peninsula.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  By 1922, his wells were providing 6 million barrels a month.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Between 1910 and 1925, Doheny took home ten million dollars a
  year from his oil investments in the United States and Mexico.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  With young Doheny's graduation from the University of Southern
  California at age 23 in 1916 he entered his father's business
  and knowing many social luminaries he was persuaded by <A HREF="Seaver.html">Frank
  Seaver</A>, who was then a young up an coming lawyer and the
  commanding officer of the Second Battalion of the <A HREF="CNM.html">California
  Naval Militia</A> to participate in its programs. Frank Seaver
  persuaded him to join the Militia.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  That organization was actively supported by his father E.L. Doheny.
  Doheny was jingo and a month before the United States declared
  war in 1917 he established the Practical Patriots League in Los
  Angeles. The main purpose of the organization was to stimulate
  recruitment for the Navy and to provide for National Assistance
  to the families of the Militia men who had been called to active
  duty.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Doheny was commissioned a full lieutenant on January 22, 1917
  and four months later was called into active federal service,
  although he was then the father of two children.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  He was assigned to the USS HUNTINGTON (ACR-5), an armored cruiser.
  Although he had requested recruiting duty in Los Angeles which
  was denied by the Commandant of the Southern California Naval
  Militia District, Commander Alfonso Henry Woodbine. Commander
  Woodbine insisted that he join Captain Robinson on the staff
  of the HUNTINGTON. Woodbine was the HUNTINGTON's Executive Officer
  and First Lieutenant.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The armored cruiser HUNTINGTON was first launched on April 18,
  1903 bearing the name USS WEST VIRGINIA. With the new battleships
  coming on line, she was renamed HUNTINGTON, a city in West Virginia
  on 11 November 1916. In late 1914, she became part of the Pacific
  Reserve Fleet and was overhauled to accommodate catapult sea
  planes on the boat deckways.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  With the approach of war, the HUNTINGTON was placed in full commission
  in early April 1917 and within days numerous Naval Militia men
  reported aboard to augment the crew and make her ready for sea.
  HUNTINGTON departed Mare Island on May 11, 1917, transited the
  Panama Canal and arrived at Pensacola on May 28, spending two
  months at the Naval Aeronautic Station at Pensacola engaging
  in a series of early flight experiments with sea planes being
  launched from her deck. During that Pensacola period, <A HREF="Simpson.html">Frank
  Simpson, Jr.</A>, the subject of another article, was a California
  acquaintance of Doheny then undergoing Naval Flight instruction
  at Pensacola. He knew Edward L. Doheny well and in writing home
  to his parents on May 31, 1917, said the following:</FONT>
  <DL>
    <DL>
      <DT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Had lunch with Commander Woodine
      on board USS HUNTINGTON today &#150; and he had dinner with me
      tonight.</FONT></I>
      <DT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      He evidently didn't think much of young Doheny &#150;Doheny wanted
      to stay in Los Angeles on recruiting duty and Woodbine said he
      had enough trouble makers at home &#150;so he took him along
      on board ship.... Morgan Adams is wild at having been stuck in
      the Farragut on patrol duty (his regular job is the same thing
      I thought it such a hardship to have to do for a few days).</FONT></I>
      <DT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      When Commander Woodbine came home from San Francisco this spring
      he found Adams and the Dohenys had cooked up a fine deal &#150;
      so he Commander Woodbine &#150; phoned the Practical Patriots
      League and said &#150; &#145;send your authorized representative
      to my office at the Armory this afternoon.'</FONT></I>
      <DT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
      Mr. and Mrs. Doheny and somebody else came. Commander Woodbine
      said &#145;People you are evidently sincere in desire to help
      the Naval Militia &#150; but in order that we come to a proper
      working basis &#150; let me tell you that I am the boss of the
      Naval Militia in So. Cal &#150; and everything must go through
      my hands and be approved by me. He said he had no more trouble.&quot;</FONT></I>
    </DL>
    <DT>&nbsp;
    <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">After an affectionate letter closing to
    his parents, he went on to say by way of a footnote:</FONT>
    <DL>
      <DT>&nbsp;
      <DT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;Commander Woodbine said that
      he didn't think young Doheny would pass the mental exams a fine
      bunch of pikers and four flushers, those Dohenys &#150; courtesy
      to even acknowledge my letters &#150; patriotism? Not at all
      &#150; just an attempt to gain notoriety. Have that fine son
      of theirs detailed to a soft berth at home &#150; I may yet be
      able to use them so will sit tight but someday Mr. Doheny Sr.
      is going to hear the straight from me.&quot;</FONT></I>

  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Within a few days after arrival of the
  ship at Pensacola, Doheny, Sr. arrived and visited the ship and
  a conversation with Captain John Taylor Robinson, its Skipper.
  By Robinson, what he thought of the Navy's handling of its oil
  reserves Doheny said &quot;well it is being handled very well
  for the people you have for neighbors, but you were not going
  to have any property there in a very few years. Robinson later
  said that conversation from such a practical expert as Doheny
  had opened his eyes to the danger to the Navy from drainage by
  adjacent wells. In that conversation, something else must have
  been said for Doheny was detached within days from the ship on
  June 13, 1917 and assigned to duty in the Judge Advocates office
  in Washington, D.C. although he was not a lawyer. He spent the
  duration there.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Upon entry of the United States into the war, Doheny his family
  and his various companies did the patriotic thing, the Pan American
  Petroleum and Transport Co. and his Mexican Petroleum Company,
  bought two million dollars in Liberty Bonds, while Doheny Sr.
  and his family bought another 1.5 million dollars individually.
  More bonds were bought by Doheny and his businesses in subsequent
  Liberty Loan Drives. Doheny's companies also contributed one
  hundred thousand dollars to the war work of the Young Mens Christian
  Association while Doheny and his family contributed an equal
  amount. This patriotic generosity did not go unnoticed in Washington.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The war ended on November 11, 1918 and on November 17 Doheny
  was detached from the Judge Advocate's Office and sent to the
  submarine base in San Pedro, California to rejoin his family.
  He was released from active duty on January 14, 1919, but continued
  to participate in the Naval Reserve with the Lieutenant's commission
  until his murder on February 16, 1929.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></FONT>

  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Upon release from active duty, Doheny
  joined his father's petroleum empire as a Senior Executive being
  a Vice President on the staff of the Petroleum Securities Corporation.
  He entered into the social life of Los Angeles becoming the President
  of the University of Southern California Alumni Association and
  was a great benefactor of the University and other causes, while
  his wife watched after a growing family. He enjoyed significant
  social contacts with the Los Angeles Athletic Club, the Los Angeles
  Country Club and membership on the boards of leading civic organizations.
  He became a trustee of the University of Southern California
  and was a generous contributor giving a two hundred thousand
  dollar endowment.<HR ALIGN=LEFT></FONT>

  Washington Scene</FONT></B></CENTER>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1920, there was a change in the administration
  in Washington. President Harding assumed the office and appointed
  various department officials. Edward Edwin Denby of Michigan
  and a former congressman was appointed by Harding to the Office
  of Secretary of the Navy. Denby, in turn, appointed Captain Robinson
  to head the Navy's Bureau of Engineering raising him to the temporary
  rank of Rear Admiral and placing him in charge of the Navy's
  Petroleum Reserve.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  In the meantime, Albert Bacon Fall had become Secretary of the
  Department of the Interior and knowing Doheny's interests in
  acquiring additional domestic reserves began a scheme to have
  the petroleum transferred from the Navy Department to the Department
  of Interior under his control. Fall was pressured with financial
  obligations.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Earlier, President William Howard Taft had withdrawn the Public
  Lands for the use of the Navy in 1910 and by executive order
  created the Naval Petroleum Reserve consisting of 69,310 acres
  in the Elk Hills, Kern County, California and an additional 29,341
  acres in the Tea Pot Dome area of Natoma County, Wyoming.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The Navy had converted from coal to oil burning ships by 1912
  and the government wanted to be sure that petroleum reserves
  will be available if the commercial sources became scarce. Additionally,
  the availability of cheap government oil would act as a cap to
  extortionate prices charged by the commercial producers.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The fear of drainage from adjacent wells to Naval properties
  was a common fear and Secretary Josephus Daniels felt that under
  certain circumstances it may be necessary to lease parts of the
  Reserve. At his urging on June 4, 1920, Congress passed a law
  giving the Secretary of the Navy power to develop operate or
  lease parts of the Naval Reserve and giving him the power to
  sell or exchange petroleum products for the Navy, a small budget
  of half a million dollars was also appropriated for the project.</FONT>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">By May 31, 1921, President Harding signed
  an executive order giving the Secretary of Interior, Fall, complete
  control of the Naval Reserves and a few weeks later Fall wrote
  to Doheny,</FONT>
  <DL>
    <DT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;there shall be no further conflict
    with Navy officials&quot; as he had told Denby, he would take
    complete charge, &quot;he understands the situation and that
    I shall handle matters exactly as I think best and will not consult
    with any officials of any bureau of this department, but only
    with himself and such a consultation shall be confined strictly
    and entirely to matters of general policy&quot;.</FONT></I>
  </DL>
  <P>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Transfer of the petroleum reserves embittered powerful figures
  in the Navy Department. Fall decided to pacify he Navy brass
  by helping them deal with an old problem for many years the Navy
  had wanted to build petroleum storage depots at Pearl Harbor,
  Hawaii and along the Atlantic Coast, but with the downsizing
  of the Military Congress had denied these funds.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The Navy thought that it could fund the construction work with
  royalties from some small oil leases it had granted. Although
  that Congress demanded these royalties be deposited in the Treasury's
  General Fund, but in any event the storage depot project would
  cost two hundred million dollars which was more than the Navy's
  oil income.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Fall found a way around this suggestion that Navy take its royalties
  and certificates from the Oil Companies which could be used to
  pay for the construction of the depots, that is if more of the
  Naval Reserves were leased there would be enough money and certificates
  to pay for the construction of oil storage depots by the oil
  companies.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  On November 28, 1921, Doheny signed a proposal to build the oil
  storage depot at Pearl Harbor in exchange for the Navy's crude
  oil. The very next day, Fall called Doheny and told him to go
  ahead and said the &quot;loan&quot; they had talked about was
  due.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Doheny then dispatched his son, Edward L. Doheny, Jr. and Doheny,
  Jr.'s employee and friend, Hugh Theodore Plunkett, to deliver
  the loan. The two men went to the brokerage house of Blair and
  Company withdrew one hundred thousand dollars in cash from Ned's
  account wrapped the money in paper and put it in a little black
  bag and took it to Fall in his apartment at the Wardman Park
  Hotel in Washington. Later Ned Doheny claimed that Fall had given
  him a receipt for the &quot;loan&quot;.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  On April 17, 1922, the government accepted Doheny's bid to build
  the Pearl Harbor storage facilities in exchange for its choice
  of any lease on the Elk Hills Reserve in exchange for building
  a storage capacity of 1.5 million barrels of fuel oil, he would
  receive 6 million barrels of crude oil. Later, another agreement
  was made by which Doheny agreed to build oil storage tanks and
  build a refinery in San Pedro, California (the Port of Los Angeles)
  and build a separate pipeline from the Elk Hills in Kern County,
  California southward to San Pedro in exchange for which Doheny
  got the right to lease the entire Elk Hills Reserve for 15 years.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The oil in the ground at Elk Hills was estimated at between 75
  and 250 million barrels being worth at least one hundred million
  dollars. Fall signed the contract on December 11, 1922. This
  undoubtedly a sweetheart deal and within a matter of months indictments
  were issued. Congressional hearings were held and indictments
  were issued against Albert Fall, Doheny and Harry Sinclair (Standard
  Oil of Indiana and a beneficiary of the Tea Pot Dome lease hold).</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The first civil case, to rescind the Doheny oil lease contracts
  came to trial on October 21, 1924. This was Admiral John Keeler
  Robinson, Ned's former Commanding Officer who portrayed the whole
  thing as a patriotic project to ensure that there was fuel for
  the Pacific Fleet. He said that Doheny had told him that his
  company would bid on the construction of the storage facilities
  and &quot;what is more, I will tell you admiral&quot;, said Doheny,
  &quot;If you get a bid from me or my company it will be one that
  won't involve one cent of profit to me&quot;.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  One of Doheny's lawyers laid it on thick, &quot;America can sleep
  tonight secure from danger of being overrun by a Mongol country
  because the patriotism of such men as E. L. Doheny, Edwin Denby
  and Admiral John K. Robinson and their work in establishing a
  great Naval base in Hawaii. These men have been humiliated and
  vilified because they endeavored to save you and me and our country&quot;.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The civil trials were followed by criminal trials against Doheny
  and Fall. Fall was convicted of accepting a bribe.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Doheny was represented by lawyer Frank Hogan, a successful criminal
  attorney, who once remarked the ideal client is a rich man who
  was scared. Doheny paid Hogan $1,000,000 for his work on the
  case and he succeeded in having Doheny acquitted, although Fall
  went to jail.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Summation: The close of the case was a masterpiece of forensic
  showmanship. He made an emotional appeal to the jury portraying
  his client as a pioneer or prospector or patriot and pointing
  to Ned Doheny, he declared,</FONT>
  <DL>
    <DT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">&quot;That old man offered that young
    man's life upon the alter of patriotism. He went on the ships
    of war over the turbulent and submarine infested oceans in his
    country's service.&quot; He reminded the jury that Ned was an
    only son, &quot;and you are asked to believe that when Edward
    L. Doheny near the end of his life corruptly intended to bribe
    Albert B. Fall, a Secretary in the Cabinet of Warren G. Harding,
    he deliberately and purposely used as an instrument, therefore
    his son, the pride of his youth, the hope of his maturity, the
    solace of his old age!! And yet, unless you believe that, you
    cannot believe there was a bribe. You cannot believe that there
    was a criminal mind and a corrupt heart motivating this thing;
    you cannot believe in all the labored argument of our opponents.
    Do you believe that man is a crook? If he's a crook, convict
    him. But can you believe that his mind was so corrupt that he
    conceived bribery and that he had fallen so low that he selected
    his own son, whom a few years before he had given to the Navy,
    as an instrument of his bribery. Now Doheny says to you from
    the grave that which in life he said from this very witness stand.
    This indictment charges that young Doheny was a briber. Can you
    believe that? Can you believe that a man who a few years before
    had offered his only son to his country and fallen so low that
    he took him, the expected solace of his old age, and made him
    an instrument of his bribery? It isn't human to believe it!&quot;</FONT></I>
  </DL>
  <P>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Doheny was acquitted in less than one hour after the jury was
  charged.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  The United States Supreme Court handed its decision on October
  11, 1927 declaring that the leases had involved fraud and were
  therefore rescinded as void. However, Sinclair and Doheny had
  to return to the government the Navy's Reserves at Tea Pot Dome
  in Elk Hills along with over 24 million dollars from Doheny's
  Pan American Petroleum Company and 500,000 dollars from Sinclairs
  Mammoth Oil Company. That ended the civil suits. <HR ALIGN=LEFT></FONT>

  <DT><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Plunkett's
  Role</FONT></B></CENTER>
  <DT>&nbsp;
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial">Theodore Plunkett was born in Kansas and
  worked at a job changing tires in service stations. When World
  War I broke out, he served as a machinist on a submarine chaser.
  Returning from the War he went to work for the Doheny's and became
  a &quot;secretary&quot; of Ned Doheny. He was involved in many
  of the family's financial affairs and was a trusted gopher. He
  was given to nervous breakdowns and had been hospitalized at
  the Doheny expense.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  At the time of the trial, Doheny, Sr. was still facing a trial
  in the criminal court for bribing Fall. Doheny knew that if Fall,
  who would be tried first were found guilty, he would have to
  convince the jury that he had not given the bribe that Fall had
  already been convicted of accepting. The case could be expected
  to hinge on the testimony of Ned Doheny and Hugh Plunkett who
  had actually delivered the money in the black bag. Obviously
  if Plunkett was diagnosed as psychotic and residing in sanatorium,
  Plunkett could not be called to testify about the bribe to Fall.
  Even if he were out of the institution, the testimony of a man
  with mental problems would lack credibility. Doheny, Sr. brought
  his friend and physician, Dr. Fishbaugh, who attempted to convince
  Plunkett to enter a sanatorium. That same day Mr. and Mrs. Doheny
  visited Plunkett at his apartment at Greystone in an attempt
  to convince him to enter the sanatorium and there was an argument.
  Later that evening when Plunkett showed up at the Doheny mansion.
  Ned decided the time had come to put him in a mental institution.
  The Los Angeles Times account said it was because of Ned's inability
  to quiet the mad man and his belief that a showdown on the plan
  to have Plunkett placed in a sanatorium for rest should be had
  then that caused Doheny to put in a hurried telephone call for
  Dr. Fishbaugh who later received the message at a Hollywood Theater.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  On the evening of February 18, 1929, something happened. Plunkett
  apparently shot Ned to death and turned the gun on himself. There
  was apparently cover ups by the family physician and a delaying
  in reporting the events to the police department, with contrary
  reports of what really transpired.</FONT>
  <DT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
  Both Ned and Plunkett were the apparent victims of Old Man Doheny's
  ambition. It is with a bit of irony that the Teapot Dome Scandal
  caused Fall to be convicted of accepting a bribe and that Doheny
  Sr. was found innocent of offering to bribe.</FONT>
