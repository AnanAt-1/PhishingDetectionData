He made his NHL debut the following season at the age of just 18, playing a single game for the Canadiens, but remained in junior for most of the following two seasons, during which time he began to dominate the QMJHL and establish himself as a blue-chip NHL prospect.

Montreal still include Momesso on the 1986 Montreal Canadiens team winning picture, and gave him a Stanley Cup ring.<br />
<br />
Momesso would spend two more seasons in Montreal but never recaptured the form of his rookie year, battling injuries and frustrating the team with his inconsistency. At the conclusion of the 1987–88&nbsp;season, he was dealt to the St. Louis Blues&nbsp;in a multi-player trade.<br />
<br />
After a mediocre first season in St. Louis during which he recorded 26 points in 53 games, Momesso's career took an upward turn in 1989–90&nbsp;when he was placed on a line with superstar sniper <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("92392",this,"brett_hull.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("92392")' href="/topics/Brett_Hull">Brett Hull</a><span class="hp" id="m92392"><div class="hpHeader">Brett Hull</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i92392"></div>Brett Andrew Hull  is a former Canadian-American NHL player and the former Executive Vice President of the Dallas Stars.

Spending much of the season on the Blues' top line, Momesso turned in the most productive year of his career, finishing with 24 goals and 32 assists for 56 points, along with 199 penalty minutes. However, he would lose his spot on the top line in 1990–91, and recorded just 10 goals through his first 59 appearances.<br />
<H3>Vancouver Canucks</H3>
At the trade deadline in 1991, Momesso was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in a monster six-player deal along with <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("93648",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("93648")' href="/topics/Geoff_Courtnall">Geoff Courtnall</a><span class="hp" id="m93648"><div class="hpHeader">Geoff Courtnall</div><div class="hpContent">Geoffrey Lawton Courtnall  is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player in the National Hockey League  from 1983 to 2000.

The deal would prove to be a heist in favour of Vancouver, as all four players they acquired would be significant contributors for several seasons, and is still regarded as perhaps the best trade in Canuck franchise history. Momesso got his Canuck career off to a fine start, recording 6 goals in 11 games to help the team on a successful late-season push to qualify for the playoffs.<br />
<br />
Momesso's stay in Vancouver, although up-and-down at times, would be the longest stop of his career. He continued to show glimpses of his ability to be an above-average power forward, but would frustrate with stretches of ineffective, uninspired play and was prone to undisciplined penalties. Through his first two seasons in Vancouver, he played largely on a line with <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("46791",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("46791")' href="/topics/Jim_Sandlak">Jim Sandlak</a><span class="hp" id="m46791"><div class="hpHeader">Jim Sandlak</div><div class="hpContent">James Sandlak, Jr.  is a retired professional ice hockey player who spent 11 seasons in the National Hockey League and was known as "The House" due to his large stature.-Playing career:...</div><br></span>&nbsp;and his former St. Louis teammmate <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("72105",this,"cliff_ronning.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("72105")' href="/topics/Cliff_Ronning">Cliff Ronning</a><span class="hp" id="m72105"><div class="hpHeader">Cliff Ronning</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i72105"></div>Clifford John Ronning  is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey forward.

(As a result, the line would be known as 'the Twin Towers'). In 1991–92, he played some of the best hockey of his career to finish with 20 goals and 43 points despite missing 26 games due to injury. In 1992–93, he had another solid year to finish with 18 goals and 38 points, as well as a career-high 200 penalty minutes.<br />
<br />
1993–94&nbsp;would be a struggle for Momesso, as he struggled and finished with just 27 points, his lowest total since 1989, and was a target for substantial criticism from Vancouver fans and media. However, he redeemed himself in the 1994 playoffs, as his strong physical play on a line with <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("25247",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("25247")' href="/topics/Martin_Gelinas">Martin Gelinas</a><span class="hp" id="m25247"><div class="hpHeader">Martin Gelinas</div><div class="hpContent">Martin Gélinas  is a former professional ice hockey forward and the current director of player development with the Nashville Predators.-Playing career:Gelinas made a splash in 1987–88 with the Hull Olympiques of the QMJHL with a 63-goal, 131-point campaign...</div><br></span>&nbsp;and <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("75875",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("75875")' href="/topics/Nathan_LaFayette">Nathan LaFayette</a><span class="hp" id="m75875"><div class="hpHeader">Nathan LaFayette</div><div class="hpContent">Nathan LaFayette  is a former ice hockey player in the NHL.
