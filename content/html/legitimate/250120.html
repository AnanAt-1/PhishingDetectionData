This workshop, sponsored by 
<a href="http://www.aimath.org/">AIM</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>, 
will be devoted to
algorithms for factoring polynomials.
Univariate and multivariate polynomials will be considered,
with coefficients from finite fields, the rationals, and
the complex numbers.  Dense polynomials, where
all coefficients are present, will be considered,
as well as sparse polynomials that
have many zero coefficients.

<p>

The problem of factoring polynomials is a classical problem
of algebra with classical algorithms due to, for instance,
Newton, Puisseux,
Eisenstein, Gauss, Kronecker, Hilbert, and Hensel,
and modern algorithms that use
randomization,
lattice basis reduction,
baby-steps giant-steps techniques,
root power and logarithmic derivates sums,
and numerical approximation.
Modern algorithms utilize efficient data structures
such as straight-line programs and black boxes for evalution.
The goal of the workshop is to invent significantly
faster new algorithms, or in turn establish hardness
of a given factorization problem.

<p>
The main topics for the workshop are:

<ul>
<li> The fastest-known asymptotic running times of algorithms
for factoring univariate and multivariate polynomials over
finite fields, the rational and the complex numbers in dense
and sparse representation.
<li> Approximate factorization of multivariate polynomials over the
    complex numbers whose coefficients may be given approximately
    due to errors caused by physical measurements or by floating
    point computation.

<li> NP-hardness of irreducibility and root finding of
polynomials in sparse and straight-line representation over
finite fields and the rational numbers.
<li> Algorithms for computing the Galois group of a univariate
polynomials over the rational numbers.
</ul> 

<p>

The workshop will differ from typical conferences in some regards.
Participants will be invited to suggest open problems and questions
before the workshop begins, and these will be posted on the workshop
website. These include specific problems on which there is hope of
making some progress during the workshop,
as well as more ambitious problems which may influence
the future activity of the field.
Lectures at the
workshop will be focused on familiarizing the participants with the
background material leading up to specific problems, and the 
schedule will include discussion and working sessions.

The deadline to apply for support to participate in this
workshop has passed.
