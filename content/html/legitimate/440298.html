<P>The 26<SUP>th</SUP> annual Ted Brill Great 8 Tournament gets underway Friday night at 6:00 pm with four quarterfinals. Semifinals are Saturday, with quarterfinal winners meeting at 1:00 and 3:30 pm and quarterfinal losers meeting at 12:30 and 3:00 pm. <BR><BR>On Sunday, the seventh place game is at 11:30 am; the fifth place game is at 2:00 pm; the third place game is at noon; and the championship game is at 2:30 pm. </P>

<P align=center><FONT size=5>Top 25 From Minn. State Tournament</FONT></B></P>
<P>It’s taken awhile to put this together, but here it is: 25 players that stood out for us at the Minnesota State High School Tournament, played March 7-10. <BR><BR>This is not a ranking, but rather an alphabetical list. In putting it together, we were looking for players with the potential to play in the USHL and beyond.&nbsp; That was our sole criteria.</P>
<P>Nine of the 25 players are from Class A (Orono, Blake, Little Falls, and Albert Lea were defeated in the quarterfinals. In the semis, Duluth Marshall edged St. Thomas Academy, 3-2 in double overtime; and Hermantown got by Warroad, 4-3. In the final, Hermantown topped Duluth Marshall, 4-1, to finish the season undefeated.) <BR><BR>Sixteen players are from Class AA (Woodbury, Hill-Murray, Edina, and Blaine were all defeated in the quarterfinals. In the semis, Roseau beat Rochester Century, 3-1; and Grand Rapids needed overtime to top Burnsville, 4-3. In the final, Roseau beat Grand Rapids, 5-1.) </P>
<P>Not a single metro team made the finals in either conference. </P>
<P>For most players, we’ve supplied both full-season stats and state tournament stats. <BR><BR><BR></P>

<P align=center><FONT size=5>Monarchs Win Tier III Jr. A Title</FONT></P></B>The New Hampshire Jr. Monarchs won the inaugural USA Hockey Tier III National Championship, topping the Bay State Breakers, 5-1, last night at Walpole’s Iorio Arena. 
<P></P>
<P>The game was a rematch of the EJHL Championship Series, which the Monarchs took with 5-0 and 6-0 wins on March 17-18. </P>
<P>The story back then was Monarchs goaltender <B>James Mello</B> and his back-to-back shutouts. Last night, though, the Breakers finally solved him, nicking him for a third-period goal. In the three games vs. the Breakers, Mello stopped 101 of 102 shots. <BR><BR>Last night, the Monarchs started out a little slowly, but a rebound goal by <B>Nick DelGallo</B> with 22 seconds left in the first gave the Monarchs a 1-0 lead going into the first intermission.</P>
<P>In the second, the Monarchs dominated, outshooting the Breakers, 20-6. However, Breakers goalie <B>Nick Krauss</B> was solid, only allowing one goal, a Rence Coassian power play goal.</P>
<P>In the third, the Monarchs added three more goals, the final an empty-netter, to salt things away.<BR><BR>DelGallo, who had a pair of goals, was named game MVP.</P>
<P>“Except for six losses,” said Monarchs head coach <B>Sean Tremblay</B>, “it was a perfect season. We won every tournament we were entered in -- and we won the league title and a national championship. Everything we could have won, we did. There wasn’t anything that this team set as a goal that they didn’t accomplish. I’m really proud of them. They set the bar high, and they did it with class and integrity. They’re a great group of young men.” <BR><BR><BR></P><div class="article-divider"></div><BR>

<P align=center><FONT size=5>Velleca, Jillson Makes Their Picks</FONT></P></STRONG>-- 6’1”, 180 lb. forward <STRONG>Jeff Velleca </STRONG>of the New England Falcons (EJHL) has committed to Union College for the fall of ’08.<BR><BR>Velleca, a 4/17/87 birthdate in his second year with the Falcons, had a 25-33-58 line in 45 games and finished as the Falcons’ leading scorer.

<P>Velleca has good speed, and the ability to find open guys. He’s also a strong penalty killer. </P>
<P>Before going to the Falcons, Velleca, a Waterbury, Conn. native, played for Notre Dame-Fairfield HS. <BR><BR>--&nbsp; 5’10”, 160 lb. forward <STRONG>Locke Jillson </STRONG>of the Dallas Stars Midget AAA squad has committed to Cornell for the fall of ’08.</P>

<P>U.S. Under-18 Team forward <STRONG>Jimmy Hayes</STRONG>, a late ’89 who is currently in the 11<SUP>th</SUP> grade, has been invited back to the NTDP next year, even though he will have aged out and be ineligible for the World Under-18s. </P>
<P>He is undecided about accepting the offer.</P>
<P>Hayes, who is expected at BC in the fall of ’08, has ruled out playing in the USHL.

<P><B>Stephen Buco</B> scored on a wraparound at 5:57 of the third period to break the 0-0 deadlock. <B>Peter Taylor</B> and <B>Stephen Devereaux</B> picked up assists on the goal.</P>

<P>Hendricken went into the best-of-three series undefeated in two years of Rhode Island state play, but lost the opener of the best-of-three series as Mount senior goaltender <B>Luke Mayer</B> stopped all 40 shots he faced as his team blanked Hendricken, 3-0, Friday night.</P>
<P>Saturday night, in game two, the Mount rode the momentum, taking a 3-0 lead after the first period. At that point Hendricken woke up and took control of things, scoring three in the second and adding the game winner in the third.</P>

<P align=center><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">Pereira to BU</SPAN></B></P>
<P>South Kent School senior forward <B>Joe Pereira</B> has committed to Boston University.</P>
<P>Pereira, who had committed to UConn last August, decommitted recently. As for Boston University, the BU staff reports that Pereira initiated things, contacting them and possibly others, a couple of weeks ago – in the days leading up to the Hockey East Tournament. Subsequently, Pereira informed UConn that he had had a change of heart. Last week, UConn sent out an email to all schools asking them to back off. The BU staff reports, however, that when they contacted UConn coach <B>Bruce Marshall </B>to ask if Pereira had indeed decommitted they were told that he had.  </P>
<P>Pereira’s coach at South Kent, <B>Geoff Marotollo</B>, insists that, “No one infringed in this situation. No one contacted Joe Pereira. No one.”</P>
<P>When Pereira informed his coach that he was decommitting, Marotollo suggested he sleep on it. Pereira did, but his decision to decommit did not change. <BR><BR>After that, Pereira contacted schools – BU, UMass, UNH, Northeastern, and likely others as well.</P>
<P>“The kid didn’t want to go,”Marotollo said. “I lose kids a lot – even with a signed contract. If they don’t want to come I just rip it up and move on.”</P>
<P>“UConn has handled it well. (Assistant coach) <B>Matt Plante</B> did an excellent job. After getting hired there that was his first goal – getting Pereira. And he did.”    </P>
<P>Pereira, a 5’10” center and an ’88 birthdate, is quick, clever, has a good stick and the vision to know what to do with it. In 27 games for South Kent, he posted a team-leading 25-25-50 line, and was a key factor in leading his team to the Div. I prep final four in Salem earlier this month. </P>

<P><B>
<P align=center><FONT size=5>Beantown Classic</FONT></P></B>Last Thursday was the big day at the Beantown Spring Classic in Marlborough, Mass. Over 150 players, and about 125 college recruiters and pro and junior scouts on hand. The level of play was very good, and the players were well-chosen -- very, very few were in over their heads. As usual, some players hadn’t been on skates in 2-3 weeks while others are still playing. With that said, our approach to these things is simply this: if a player does well, we take note. And, conversely, if a player looks out of sync, we are forgiving because, as we said, the season is already in the rear-view mirror for many of the kids. Timing is key in hockey and it can be hard to get back once you’ve spent a couple weeks on vacation. 
<P></P>
<P>With games going on simultaneously, it was impossible to see every moment of every game, but we did manage to catch each team twice.<BR><BR>We paid slightly more attention to the younger birth years, so we’ll start with them first.</P>
<P><B><BR></B><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Pre-Draft Division (’90, ’91, and ’92</SPAN></B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">)<B>:</B></SPAN><BR><BR>First off, the goaltending was uniformly strong. <B>Clay Witt</B> (’91, Junior Bruins Empire), whose team is still playing, was excellent, probably the best prospect for our money. 6’3” <B>Jake Williams</B> (’90, Northfield-Mt-Hermon) also caught our eyes – quick for a big kid. There’s upside there. We also found <B>TJ Massie</B> (’90, Cushing) and <B>Connor Shannon</B> (’90, NH Monarchs Empire) to be sharp.&nbsp; </P>
<P>On the blue line, we thought <B>Jeff Buvinow</B> (’90, Gunnery) was excellent. He’s 5’8”, 165 lbs so he’s extremely slight, but he’s smooth, highly mobile, an excellent passer, and has good vision. 5’10” <B>Michael Chiasson</B> (‘91, Las Vegas Outlaws), the son of the late NHL defenseman Steve Chiasson, was paired up with Buvinow, and played with a lot of poise. 6’1” <B>Paul Dimitruk</B> (’90, Exeter) has good mobility for his size – he played well. <B>Gus Young</B> (’91, Nobles) is not at all flashy, but he’s strong on his skates, plays a conservative game, and just keeps things simple. 6’1” <B>Zach Carriveau</B> (’90, Portland Jr. Pirates) showed promise. <B>Danny Furlong</B> (’91, CM) skates well with the puck, keeps his head up, and is another good prospect. <B>Ryan Kavanaugh</B> (’91, Tabor) is on the small side at 5’8”, 170, but was excellent here – played physically and connected on some nice passes. 6’0<B>” Joey Dillon</B> and 5’11” <B>Evan Gogonis</B>, both ‘90s from the Junior Bruins Empire Team, made an impact. Both can make that nice first pass out of the zone as well as set it up from the blue line.&nbsp; <BR><BR>Up front, we liked 5’10” <B>Justin Bruckel</B> (’90, Syracuse – EJHL) – excellent speed and a quick release on his shot plus he has a year of juniors under his belt. 5’8” <B>Casey Brugman</B> (’90, Cushing) is a determined wind-up toy. He just gets at it and doesn’t let up. Several Foxboro Stars ’90 birthdates stood out, chief among them 6’0” <B>Sean Logue</B>, who can skate, hit hard, and really fire it – an excellent prospect. 6’0” <B>John Sperzel</B>, a strong skater, and 6’1” <B>Eric Robinson</B> stood out as well. 5’11” <B>Mark Goggin</B> (’90, Choate) was exceptionally good. He can slow the game down, dictate the pace, and sees it really well. 5’6” <B>Matt Crowley</B> (’91, Connecticut Jr. Wolves) is small, but it might not matter – he’s magic with the puck on his stick, and can operate in tight spaces. 5’9” <B>Derek Arnold</B> (’90, Junior Bruins Empire) is a nice prospect – he’s well-rounded, and can set guys up or get open himself. 6’0” <B>Mark Anthoine</B> (’90, Portland Jr. Pirates) has already committed to Maine, and it’s easy to see why. Every time he’s on the ice you notice him. 6’1” <B>Matt Zarbo</B> (’90, Junior Bruins) has a year of EJ experience – he plays hard, and is hard to miss. 6’1” <B>John Henrion</B> (’91, Junior Bruins) looked a little sleepy in the morning game – he’d been out at the NTDP camp – but cranked it up in the evening session, opening eyes with a couple of big-time snipes. Last but not least, we wanted to mention the ‘92s on hand – there were only a handful – and several of them were very intriguing. 5’9” <B>Jon Mleczko</B>, who already has a year of prep play under his belt as a freshman at Milton Academy, really stood out for his speed – he can fly. 5’11”, 197 lb. <B>Billy Arnold</B> of the Fessenden School will be popping up at one of a handful of top prep programs in the fall. He’s only 14 and carrying baby fat but, when that disappears, he could be a major force. He didn’t look at all out of place in this crowd. Another top 14-year-old prospect is forward <B>Kevin Hayes</B>, the younger brother of BC recruit Jimmy Hayes. He bears some similarities to his older brother at the same age. He’s smart, poised, likely to shoot up in size, and in time his skating will smooth out. Look for him to be an impact player at Nobles before too long.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There were others who played well, and if we left anyone out, we apologize. </P>
<P><B><BR></B><B><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Draft Division (’87, ’88, and ’89): </SPAN></B></P>
<P>We spent a little less time with the older group, so please keep that in mind when perusing the following. And, in the time we did spend, we focused primarily on players we were less familiar with, and let the rest of the players come to us. The following is not intended to be a complete list, but, rather, some comments on players who stood out for us.<BR><BR>In net, the big eye-opener was <B>Nick Eno</B> (’89, Green Mountain Glades). He’s 6’3”, 190 lbs. and technically sound, with quick feet for someone his size. He has the tools to be a top goaltender in the EJHL next season.&nbsp; </P>
<P>On defense, the biggest revelation was 5’11” <B>Cam Burt</B> (’87, New England Huskies), who was excellent, and certainly opened a lot of eyes. A Detroit native, he can skate, he can make plays, plus he’s quick and highly athletic. He was extremely effective both offensively and defensively. In his own end, he used an effective sweep check, an underutilized skill these days. 6’2” <B>Eric Baier</B> (’88, NH Jr. Monarchs) was consistently noticeable for his ability to consistently skate the puck end-to-end. He was an offensive powerhouse. 6’2” <B>Drew Mackenzie</B> (’88, Taft) was excellent as well – just a strong prototypical defenseman who just seems to keep getting better. That trio really stood out.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Up front, 5’10” <B>Nick Pitsikoulis</B> (‘88, Westminster) the Greek God of Goals and the scourge of Salisbury, was a standout, consistently creating offense. 6’0” <B>Patrick Cullen</B> (’89, Washington Jr. Nationals) was a player we hadn’t seen before. The RPI recruit could be a very good one – he can skate and shoot it. 6’0” <B>Brian Flynn</B> (’88, Pomfret) beat the Monarchs James Mello with a really nice 5-hole goal. He could be a good late pickup for someone, though maybe a year in juniors will help further his goals. 5’10” <B>Jeff Ryan</B> of the St. George’s School, the youngest player in the draft division – he’s a 12/27/89 birthdate – didn’t look at all out of place. He’ll be getting a lot of attention (but, as a late ’89, he’s not even draft eligible). 6’1” <B>Alex Killorn</B> (’89, Deerfield) may have helped his draft status with his play here – he certainly didn’t hurt it. Other forwards whose play jumped out at us included 6’1” <B>Nick Bonino</B> (’88, Avon), 5’10” <B>P-O Michaud</B> (Portland Jr. Pirates), 6’0” <B>Austin Smith</B> (’88, Gunnery), 5’9” <B>Stevie Moses</B> (’89, Junior Bruins), 5’10” <B>Yuri Bouharevich</B> (’87, St. Paul’s), and 6’1” <B>Jeff Velleca</B> (’87, Junior Falcons). All those guys are committed except Bouharevich and Velleca. </P>
<P>South Kent School forward <B>Joe Pereira</B> was rostered but didn’t appear in the tournament as he was reported to be making a visit to Boston University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P align=center><FONT size=5><B>All on the Line in Teeny-Tiny State</B></P></FONT>The Rhode Island Div. I finals between Mount St. Charles and Bishop Hendricken has come down to a winner-take-all third game Monday night at Providence College’s Schneider Arena. Game time is 7:30 pm.<BR><BR>The first game, Friday night, went to the Mount, as goaltender <B>Luke Mayer</B> kicked out 40 shots en route to shutting out Hendricken, the defending champs, 3-0. 
<P></P>
<P>Hendricken dominated the Mount throughout the game, outshooting them 40-12. The win broke Hendricken’s nearly two-season unbeaten streak against Rhode Island high school competition (39-0-1, with the only blip a 3-3 tie vs. the Mount in December). </P>
<P>In the second game, played last night, Hendricken came back from an early 3-0 deficit to take a 4-3 win over the Mount, in the process tying the series at a game apiece and setting up Monday’s deciding game.     </P>
<P>Mount St. Charles struck for three goals within the game’s first eight minutes, but were shut down the rest of the way. Hendricken tied it up with three second period goals and picked up the game winner when <B>Connor Moore</B> scored a power play goal at 1:36 of the third. </P>
<P>This is the 14<SUP>th</SUP> time in 26 years the two schools have met for the state championship. The Mount won the first 12 during their run of 26 straight state titles between 1978-2003. </P>
<P>Last year, Hendricken, coached <B>by Jim Creamer</B>, won its first state title and rolled on into this campaign, going 16-0-1 in the regular season. The Mount, meanwhile, lost five times in 17 regular season games. So the edge goes to Hendricken, but if Mayer can match his performance of Friday night, the hardware could return to the Mount. <BR><BR><BR></P>		<div class="article-divider"></div><BR>

<P></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">The win gave Fairfield Prep its third state title in the last four years, and twelfth overall (since 1977). In addition, Fairfield Prep (19-3-1) finished the season undefeated in Connecticut high school competition.

<P align=center><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">Junior Bruins Win Empire League Title</SPAN></B></P>The Boston Junior Bruins beat the New Hampshire Jr. Monarchs, 4-2, to win the Empire Junior Hockey League championship Sunday at RPI.&nbsp; Both teams will advance to Nationals to compete for the Silver Cup in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
<P></P>
<P><B>Steve Morra</B> led the Junior Bruins with two power play goals and <B>John Henrion</B> had a goal and two assists. </P>
<P>The Junior Bruins, skating with a 5-on-3 advantage, went up 1-0 when Morra found the back of the net at the 19:01 mark of the first half, assists going to Henrion and <B>Evan Gogonis</B>.&nbsp; The Bruins outshot the Monarchs 18-6 in the first half -- Monarchs goaltender <B>Connor Shannon</B> kept his team in it with 17 saves. (The title game was played in 25-minute halves, a decision based the fact that the two finalists had each already played a round-robin game in the morning.) </P>
<P>The goals came quickly in the second half. Henrion, off a nice set up by <B>Cory Kane</B>, made it 2-0 at the 2:42 mark.</P>
<P><B>Jay Pietrasiak</B> put the Monarchs on the board with a powerplay goal at the 10:58 mark. Monarchs goaltender Shannon picked up an assist on the goal. </P>
<P>Morra then scored his second -- from Henrion and Gogonis again -- to make it 3-1 at the 15:42 mark. <BR><BR>Pietrasiak scored his second goal of the game with exactly two minutes to play, cutting the Junior Bruins lead to 3-2.</P>
<P>With 41 seconds left to play, the Junior Bruins’ Joey Dillon found Paul Cinquegrana who scored an empty netter to make it 4-2 – and that’s where things ended. <BR><BR><B>Connor Knapp</B> was in net for the Junior Bruins and kicked out 24 shots en route to picking up the win. Knapp finished the playoffs with a 5-0 record, and led all goalies with 1.24 GAA and was second in save percentage with a .959 mark. Teammmate <B>Clay Witt</B> was second with a 1.33 GAA, but finished with a playoff leading .965 save percentage. </P>
<P>Morra led all playoff scorers with 18 points in eight games on a 10-8-18 line.<BR><BR><B><I><BR>Notes:</I></B></P>
<P>The Sunday morning game was a wild one.&nbsp; In the final round-robin game, the Monarchs went up against NY Apple Core. Whoever won -- or if Apple Core tied -- would not only move on to face the Junior Bruins in the finals, but also be guaranteed a berth at Nationals.&nbsp; The Monarchs won, 5-4, in a game that featured a batch of lead changes and a four-goal game from Pietrasiak, who scored six of the Monarch’s seven goals on the day.</P>

<P align=center><FONT size=5>BC High Repeat Champs in Mass Super 8 <BR></P></FONT></STRONG><BR>BC High won the 2007 Mass Super 8 Tournament, their second straight, with a decisive 6-1 win over Weymouth High at the TD Banknorth Garden tonight.
<P></P>
<P>Weymouth got on the board first, on a <STRONG>Mike Wilson </STRONG>goal at 9:26 of the first, and held a 1-0 lead until BC High senior defenseman <STRONG>Mike Vasilchuk </STRONG>scored&nbsp; a power play goal 6:09 into the second to tie it at 1-1.</P>
<P>That started the onslaught. BC High would add two more goals before the end of the period, and then three more in the third.<BR><BR>BC High’s goals came off the sticks of six different players, and the Eagles outshot Weymouth 26-12. Junior <STRONG>Joe Cannata </STRONG>got the win, stopping 11 of 12. Sophomore <STRONG>Chris Daugherty </STRONG>stopped 20 of 26 for Weymouth. Daugherty didn’t get much help from his teammates, who struggled to clear rebounds or slow the BC High forwards. <BR><BR>Nonetheless, we can’t take anything away from Weymouth, the Cinderella team which defeated four parochial schools – Malden Catholic, Catholic Memorial, Central Catholic, Austin Prep – and became the first public school to reach the title game since <STRONG>Shawn Bates </STRONG>led Medford to the Garden in 1993. While Weymouth fell short in the end, they brought a much-needed breath of life to the postseason, bringing an end to the tournament’s Catholic hegemony and capturing the attention of Boston-area fans in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Notes:</STRONG></EM><BR><BR>-- To get to the finals, BC High edged Catholic Memorial, 1-0, and Weymouth came back from a 3-1 deficit to beat Austin Prep 5-4 in an OT thriller. Both of those games were played in Thursday night’s crossover at Harvard’s Bright Arena in front of a jam-packed house. People were really shoe-horned in, as standees were lined up four deep around the rink and fans had to park up to a mile away and hoof their way over. And it was loud, very loud. No one who played in it will forget it. It’s safe to say that next year’s crossover will be played in a larger venue – the Boston fire marshall will insist on it. <BR><BR>-- For BC High, tonight’s win capped off a nice weekend, as the school’s basketball team won the Mass Div. I title in Worcester Saturday night. <BR><BR>-- In the tournament’s 17-year history, only three teams have won it – Catholic Memorial, BC High, and Arlington Catholic.&nbsp; <BR><BR><BR></P><div class="article-divider"></div><BR>

<P align=center><FONT size=5>McDonagh Wins Mr. Hockey<BR></P></FONT></STRONG><BR>Cretin-Derham Hall defenseman <STRONG>Ryan McDonagh </STRONG>was named Mr. Hockey Sunday.
<P></P>
<P>McDonagh, 6’1 and 190 lbs., helped lead Cretin to a state title in 2006, the school’s first in hockey. The Arden Hill, Minn. native was initially recruited to Wisconsin for the fall of ’08, but that timetable was moved up. Bypassed for the US NTDP before his junior year, McDonagh was asked to join the Under-18s for his senior year, but chose to stay at Cretin-Derham Hall and attempt to defend the school’s title. Cretin, however, was upset by Woodbury HS in the sectionals. </P>
<P>McDonagh, likely to go in the first couple rounds of June’s NHL draft, will join the U.S. Under-18 Team for next month’s world championship in the Czech Republic. </P>
<P>McDonagh is also a center fielder for Cretin-Derham Hall, a baseball powerhouse that has won ten state titles and boasts <STRONG>Joe Mauer </STRONG>and <STRONG>Paul Molitor </STRONG>as alumni. </P>
<P>The Mr. Hockey Award is given to the top senior in the state and is picked by a panel of Minnesota Div. I coaches and NHL scouts.</P>

<P align=center><FONT size=5>Monarchs, Breakers Advance to EJHL Finals</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>For each of the last three seasons, the New Hampshire Junior Monarchs have faced off against the Boston Junior Bruins for the EJHL Championship. <BR><BR>That won’t be the case this year, as the Bay State Breakers crashed the party, knocking off the Junior Bruins 1-0 on an overtime goal by <STRONG>Dan Nelson </STRONG>tonight at the New England Sports Center in Marlborough, Mass. <BR><BR>The Breakers will face the New Hampshire Jr. Monarchs in a best-of-three championship round scheduled for Sat-Sun.-Mon. March 17-18-19 at Holy Cross. Game times are 5:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday. If a third game is&nbsp; necessary it will be played Monday at 7:00 pm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Monarchs, in today’s early game, dropped a 4-3 overtime decision to the New England Junior Huskies, but came back and won the mini game, 3-0, to take the series. </P>
<P>We’ll get to that, but first a few words about the Junior Bruins-Bay State Breakers game. The salient fact was that, while the Junior Bruins outshot the Breakers 14-6 in the first period and 9-8 in the second, they couldn’t put them away. The keys were the goaltending of Bay State’s <STRONG>Brooks Ostergard</STRONG>, an ’87 from Ohio who came up big when needed, and also got help from his teammates, who did a good job keeping the Junior Bruins to the outside, holding down their scoring opportunities, and limiting odd-man rushes.&nbsp; The Junior Bruins didn’t have a lot of quality scoring opportunities, but on the ones they did have Ostergard was up to the task. </P>
<P>“Their goaltender played fantastic,” said Junior Bruins head coach <STRONG>Peter Masters</STRONG>. “I thought they also did a good job on the penalty kill – our power play, which was second in the league this season, was ineffective today. During the regular season we were carried offensively by Coyle, Solomon, Moses, and Pallos, but they struggled to score today – and we didn’t get on the scoreboard.”</P>
<P>“Bay State worked hard. They have solid D and two lines of kids who can make things happen. The question was goaltending. And it was answered. (Ostergard) was great both yesterday and today.”<BR><BR>“In the past few years,” Masters added, “there have been a couple of dominant teams in the league. What these semifinals have shown is that the next level has closed the gap and made things more competitive. It’s good for the league to have more parity.”<BR><BR>In the Monarchs-Junior Huskies game, the Huskies went up 1-0 late in the first period on an <STRONG>Egor Egorov </STRONG>goal. The Monarchs came back in the second, taking a 2-1 lead on a pair of goals by Denny Kearney. However, the Huskies tied it up at 1:25 of the third on a power play goal by <STRONG>Cameron Burt</STRONG>, an ’87 from Michigan who was a standout today, as was goalie <STRONG>Joe Calvi</STRONG>, a Bentley recruit. In OT, the Huskies won it, forcing the mini-game. The Huskies played a strong physical game and outworked the Monarchs along the boards, but when they got to the mini-game they didn’t really have much left. The deeper Monarchs were able to roll three lines while the Huskies, needing just to get to the mini game, played their top two lines more heavily than they normally would have. The legs weren’t there, and the Monarchs rolled to a 3-0 win.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR></P><div class="article-divider"></div><BR>

<P align=center><FONT size=5>P.O. to Harvard</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>P.O. Michaud</STRONG>, who committed to Harvard this week, couldn’t speak English three years ago, but that didn’t stop him from moving to Maine from his native Quebec to play with the Portland Junior Pirates Jr. B team. The next year he moved up to the Junior Pirates AJHL team, where he is now in his second year.</P>
<P>The big difference between this year and last – and the reason Harvard made their offer – is the fact that Michaud is not only a good student and a quick study when it comes to English, but that he has turned from being an excellent offensive player into a player who competes hard in all three zones. <BR><BR>“His skill, his vision, and his patience with the puck are great,” said Portland president/GM <STRONG>Sean O’Brien</STRONG>. “He makes plays and finds seams… (head coach <STRONG>Jay Pecora</STRONG>) and I are on the bench saying ’How did he find that?’ The thing he’s really learned over the past two seasons, though, is how to play away from the puck.”</P>
<P>A June ’88 birthdate, Michaud, who has great open ice speed, is Portland’s top scorer with a 26-39-65 line in 42 games. He’s eligible for June’s NHL draft and is ranked 202<SUP>nd</SUP> among North American skaters in Central Scouting’s midterm ranking. He’s worked hard on getting stronger,  a process that will continue. </P>
<P>Michaud, who is 5’11” and 175 lbs., is primarily a center, but is also frequently on the wing.  In ’03-04, when he was 15, he was playing for the Quebec Bulldogs Midget AAA squad, coached by <STRONG>Allain Lachance</STRONG>, whose son <STRONG>Jonathan</STRONG>, now at Norwich, was playing for the Portland Jr. Pirates. Through the Lachance connection, O’Brien and Pecora learned of P.O.,which is short for Pierre-Oliver. The following fall, the Mont-Joli native was in Portland.</P>
<P>Last season, Michaud  was recruited by Merrimack (who took his teammate, <STRONG>Andrew Letellier</STRONG>),  Union, and Mercyhurst. He wanted to go Ivy, though, and held off on committing anywhere. He soon found himself being recruited by Harvard, Brown, Yale, Princeton, and, from Atlantic Hockey, Holy Cross.  <BR><BR>Michaud will be ready to go when Portland's postseason gets underway tomorrow with the preliminary round of the AJHL playoffs at Cyclones Arena in Hudson, NH. The quarterfinals are on Sunday.<BR><BR>The teams that emerge from there will move on to Harvard University’s Bright Arena for the semis on Sat. March 17 (11:30 am; 2:30 pm) and the championship game on Sun. March 18 (12:00 pm). </P>
<P>It’s hard to say if Portland will make it to Bright. While the team has more Div. I commitments than any other team in the league with players like Michaud, Letellier, and Maine recruit <STRONG>Mark Anthoine</STRONG>, it's also a young team whose best players are ‘88s, ‘89s, and ‘90s.  In other words, they lose games because of their youth and lack of strength. </P>
<P><B><BR>Update:</B><BR><BR>Another player to watch in the AJHL tournament  is 6’2”, 210 lb. New Jersey Rockets RD <STRONG>John Carlson</STRONG>, a 1990 birthdate who has just committed to UMass for the fall of ’09. Big and physical, Carlson, a second year player in the league, also has offensive upside.. The Colonia, NJ native is leading his team in scoring with a 12-38-50 line in 44 games. He’s the third-leading scorer among the league’s defensemen (we should mention that the two players ahead of him are an ’86 and ’87).  <BR><BR><BR></P>		<div class="article-divider"></div><BR>

<P align=center><FONT size=5>St. Sebastian’s Gets the Love</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>In one three-year span (2000-03), St. Sebastian’s went 81-9-3, won two straight prep titles and then, reaching their third consecutive final, lost an OT heartbreaker to Deerfield.</P>
<P>The stars of that team, as many of you will remember, were forwards <STRONG>Brian Boyle </STRONG>(BC) and <STRONG>Kenny Roche </STRONG>(BU), defenseman <STRONG>Sean Sullivan </STRONG>(BU), and goaltender <STRONG>Kevin Regan </STRONG>(UNH). They were all classmates who graduated from St. Seb’s in ’03. All except for Regan, who took a year in the USHL, are now seniors who will begin play in their final Hockey East Tournament tonight. That, and the fact that they all played with and against each other growing up, is the hook of an excellent article by <STRONG>Jim McCabe </STRONG>in today’s Boston Globe, the link to which we have supplied below.</P>
<P>The article doesn’t forget <STRONG>Mike Morris </STRONG>(Northeastern), an ’02 graduate of St. Sebastian’s; and <STRONG>Joe Rooney </STRONG>(BC), who left St. Seb’s a year early for the Walpole Stars in order to accelerate. Both Morris and Rooney (Boyle’s BC roommate) are also seniors playing in their final Hockey East Tournament tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The article identifies&nbsp;St. Sebastian’s as the&nbsp;only ISL school that doesn't&nbsp;offer boarding. We don’t want to nitpick (we make mistakes, too!) but that is not correct. That aside, this article nails it, nicely identifying all that is good about Boston-area youth and prep hockey.&nbsp; </P>

<P></P>
<P>Fox’s last collegiate game was Union’s 5-4 OT loss Saturday night at Quinnipiac in the first round of the ECAC playoffs. <BR><BR>Fox had a 13-24-37 scoring line in 36 games, but Union finished last in the ECAC regular season. <BR><BR>A 6/11/84 birthdate, Fox, who’s 22, signed a two-year cap deal. An Oswego, NY native, Fox, who played at the Salisbury School in ’02-03, but left midway through the season for the Green Bay Gamblers&nbsp; (USHL), coached then by <STRONG>Mark Osiecki</STRONG>. He then played two years for the Chicago Steel (USHL), coached then by <STRONG>Wil Nichol. <BR></STRONG><BR>His next stop will likely be the Worcester Sharks, San Jose’s AHL affiliate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The free agent exodus should really pick up next week, as more teams get eliminated this weekend.</P>

<P><STRONG>Nick Bonino </STRONG>scored two goals and <STRONG>Patrick Enloe </STRONG>picked up his second shutout of the playoffs as Avon Old Farms beat Belmont Hill, 3-0, to take the 2007 New England Prep title before a packed house of 2,500 at the Icenter in Salem, NH today. </P>
<P>The win gave Avon their sixth prep title, and third in four years. All six have come under <STRONG>John Gardner</STRONG>. No other school has won more than two. </P>
<P>For full&nbsp;details,&nbsp;please go to the USHR Prep News. The short story here is that the better team won today, and Avon capped off a roll through the postseason that included a 3-0 win in the quarterfinals over Hotchkiss, and a 3-1 semifinal win over Nobles,&nbsp;with a virtually flawless performance. The Winged Beavers are good, they're deep,&nbsp;they're well-coached,&nbsp;and they can sing, as they showed when serenading their fans from the ice after being presented with the championship trophy.

<P>In the Div. II final, Hoosac, which reached the title game two years ago, but got wiped out by <STRONG>Shea Guthrie </STRONG>and St. George's, won its first championship, defeating Vermont Academy, 7-3. </P>
<P>The difference in the game was Hoosac's big line of <STRONG>Mike Schiavi </STRONG>(1g,1a), <STRONG>Sy Nutkevitch </STRONG>(1g,2a), and <STRONG>Matthew David </STRONG>(2g) plus small defenseman <STRONG>Kyle Hardy </STRONG>(2a). No other Div. II team here was able to match up with those four Montrealers. </P>

<P align=center><FONT size=5><B>EJHL Playoffs Get Underway</B></P></FONT>The Eastern Junior Hockey League playoffs start Saturday at the Foxboro Arena, with quarterfinals being played in a best-of-two-with-mini-game format. 
<P></P>
<P>It’s a cross-division setup, and here are the matchups. Two times are listed. The first is for Saturday, and the second for Sunday.<BR><BR>#1 NH Monarchs vs. #4 Foxboro Stars (5:00 pm; 12:00 pm)<BR>#1 Bay State Breakers vs. #4 Valley Jr. Warriors (5:30 pm; 12:30 pm)<BR>#2 Junior Bruins vs. #3 NY Apple Core (7:30 pm; 3:00 pm)<BR>#2 Bridgewater Bandits vs. #3 New England Huskies (8:00 pm: 3:30 pm).</P>
<P>The teams will be reseeded (based on their regular season record) for the semis, which will be held Sat.-Sun. March 10-11 at the New England Sports Center in Marlboro, Mass. That series will also be played under a best-of-two-with-mini-game format.</P>
<P>The finals will be a best-of-three setup this year, with games scheduled for Sat. March 17 (5:00 pm). Sun. March 18 (5:00 pm), and, if necessary, Mon. March 19 (7:00 pm).<BR><BR>That won’t be all. This year, a Tier III Junior A championship is being held, mainly because of the EJHL’s success at petitioning the past few years for Jr. A status. Since USA Hockey demands a national championship at every level, the EJHL must take part in the national championship, and will supply two teams (i.e. the regular season winner – the NH Monarchs and whoever wins the finals. If it’s the Monarchs that win it all, then the team they beat will be the other entrant for Nationals.) The AJHL will do the same. Though the AJHL will have a say in the matter, there’s a good chance that the same teams that met in the EJHL finals could meet at the National Tournament, which will be held at Walpole’s Iorio Arena on Mon-Tues. March 26-27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>In 2008, the Tier III Junior A championship will likely expand, as some NAHL teams are considering breaking away from that league. In addition, some Central States Junior League teams will be applying for Tier III Junior A status.<BR>
<P align=center><BR>***</P>
<P>To those thinking the Monarchs and the Junior Bruins are automatics for the finals, note that both the New England Junior Huskies and the Bay State Breakers are a couple of teams that could pose a threat.<BR><BR>The Junior Huskies have been excellent over the last month. Forward <B>Phil Ginand</B>, an ’88 who has committed to Mercyhurst for ’08, has been on a tear of late and is the third-leading scorer in the league. Defenseman <B>Phil Cote</B>, an ’86 who played at AIC last season, is on a roll, too, and leads the EJ defensemen in scoring. ’87 Ukranian <B>Egor Egorov</B>, who joined the Huskies for the last 19 games of the regular season, is averaging well over a point a game. ’86 goalie <B>Joe Calvi</B>, an Illinois native, has the third-best save percentage in the league. </P>
<P>The Bay State Breakers, an older team, finished first in their division and, if they wind up facing the Monarchs somewhere along the line, won’t lack for confidence. The Breakers crushed the Monarchs, 11-3, back in November, and the two teams have split since then, with the Monarchs winning 7-4 in November, and Bay State winning 4-3 in January.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The Boston Harbor Wolves, who won just two of their 45 regular-season games this year, have been sold for a reported $125,000. <B>John McLean</B>, who was a volunteer assistant at Merrimack and played at BC, will be the coach/GM. His brother-in-law is the main investor in the purchase of the old Charlestown MDC rink, which will be renovated and serve as the home of the Harbor Wolves. One thing is for sure: itwould be hard for the team to do worse than they did this year. There’s just one way to go, and that’s up.<BR><BR><BR></P><div class="article-divider"></div><BR>

<P>The Lowell Sun is reporting that UMass Board of Trustees Chairman <B>Stephen Tocco</B>, who desires to solidify UMass-Amherst as the state’s flagship university, wishes to move the Riverhawks from Hockey East into another conference, like the Atlantic Hockey Conference. The ECAC was mentioned too, but that seems pretty far-fetched. </P>
<P>Tocco’s proposal did not go over well with some of the other trustees, to say nothing of the UMass-Lowell community. <BR><BR>Tocco, former executive director of the Port Authority, was reportedly a force in the firing of <B>Joe Mallen</B> at UMass, so he has clout. He appears to believe that UMass-Lowell’s presence is hurting UMass-Amherst’s recruiting.&nbsp; Will this go anywhere? We don’t think so, but it’s certainly within the realm of possibility. This is also not the first time the issue has come up.<BR><BR>For what it's worth,&nbsp;UMass-Lowell was a charter member of Hockey East while UMass-Amherst didn’t join the league until 1993. <BR>&nbsp; <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P align=center><B><FONT size=5>“His Teams Played Hard”</FONT></B></P>
<P>On Wednesday, <B>Steve Jacobs</B> coached his last game at Cushing Academy. After 22 years behind the bench, Jacobs, who announced his retirement on Jan. 13, will be moving with his family to Alpharetta, Georgia, outside of Atlanta, where he will be Vice President and Director of Hockey Operations at the Cooler, an athletic complex owned by <B>John Bardis</B>, whose son Tom is a Cushing grad currently playing at St. Lawrence.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In the weeks since then, we had the opportunity to speak to some people about the Jacobs era at Cushing. We’ll stay out of the way, though, and&nbsp;let these four men, all of whom were part of the story,&nbsp;have the floor. <BR></P>
<P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P><B><I>-- Charlie Corey</I></B><I>, a longtime coach at Lawrence Academy, was behind the bench for some epic Cushing-Lawrence battles.&nbsp; <BR></I><BR>“I always thought his ability as a coach was underrated because of the talent he had. You can have a ton of talent – and with talent comes ego -- but unless you get the players on the same page you’re not going to have the success he had. His teams played hard – none played harder. I think, over the years, he didn’t get enough credit. When we played Cushing the teams really went at each other. Those were some of the best games I ever saw. Our kids <I>lived</I> to play Cushing. And I think they lived to play us.”&nbsp; <BR><BR>
<P align=center><BR>***<BR></P><BR><I>-- <B>Tom Poti</B> was a senior and the brightest star on one of the all-time great prep teams, the 1995-96 Cushing championship squad that went 35-1 and also featured Ryan Moynihan, Bobby Allen, and Joe Exter. A Worcester native, Poti is in his ninth year in the NHL. </I><BR><BR>“I owe a lot to Coach Jacobs. He’s the coach I developed under and made the most strides under. He’s a big part of the reason I am where I am today. I wouldn’t be where I am without him.” 
<P></P>
<P>“His strengths? I’d say getting the best out of every single player on the team. He wasn’t a big x’s-and-o’s guy. He was about getting the most from every player – not just the power play guys, but the third and fourth line guys, too.”<BR><BR>“He cared about each individual. He was about developing kids and getting them on to the next level. He cared more about that than the wins and losses.”<BR><BR>
<P align=center><BR>***</P>
<P><I>-- NHL Hall of Famer <B>Ray Bourque</B>, a five-time Norris Trophy winner, has sent both his sons to Cushing, first Chris and now Ryan. He has been an assistant coach at Cushing for the last six years.</I> <BR><BR>“It’s pretty remarkable the amount of years he’s been there and the impact he’s had on kids. I’ve seen first hand how involved he is, and how passionate he is – both about the game and Cushing. He’s fun to be around. He cares about the kids there and plays every one in the right spot. Every day he shows up with passion and he pushes the kids to keep getting better. His success is remarkable.”</P>
<P>“He’s always on the phone promoting his players. He cares for every one of those kids. He has a great way about him. Cushing Academy, and the kids, have been lucky that&nbsp; he’s been the coach there for so long.”<BR><BR>“He’s just been fun to work with. He runs great practices. He prepares the kids well. I like to be around people who enjoy the game and have fun with it. Both he and Bill Troy bring a lot of energy every day. I have enjoyed being able to help out. He’s been very flexible and given me a good opportunity, as well as free rein whenever I have something to say. It’s been fun, and it keeps me busy.”<BR><BR>
<P align=center><BR>***<BR></P><BR><I>-- <B>Bill Troy</B>, who has served as an assistant with Jacobs for 17 years and is the popular choice to be Jacobs’ successor, chose to put his words on paper, and faxed the following to the USHR office: <BR></I><BR>“For the past twenty-two years Steve Jacobs has put all of his focus, passion and energy into Cushing Academy and the hockey program. Each and every day he brings an intense passion to the rink. It is a passion that you can feel and see, and one that has an immediate – and lasting – impact on his players.<BR><BR>“This is an emotional time for Steve. When any coach decides to move on after 20 plus years, it can be a tough decision, and it has been that for Steve. He has helped build this program from our early days, when we had to travel by bus to the Gardner State Rink, practice, and then return to campus with all of our gear. We had a place to play, but we did not have our own arena, or a place to call our own. With Steve’s guidance and his ability to build strong relationships, there were several people who stepped up and allowed us to build Iorio Arena – a first-class arena on campus.<BR><BR>“When you look at a successful high school program from the outside, many people do not realize the hours put into the program – the meetings, the phone calls, the relationships with players and their families and, of course, the long bus trips. I have traveled across the country to many places and numerous tournaments over the past 17 years as Steve’s assistant coach. I think what Steve will miss most are the relationships with the kids, and the area that means the most to any coach – the locker room. This is where Steve shines, and where his passion for teaching and coaching can be seen. He asks every kid to give their best every day and to be prepared. He has created a culture of hard work and striving to be your best.<BR><BR>“One important thing that I have learned from Steve throughout my years as his assistant coach is that we should never stop learning. You can always learn more about hockey and you can always learn how to treat people better. He is always reading books by other coaches, always searching to be a better coach. There are many days when his phone rings and it will be a player from three, four, even ten years ago, checking in or asking for some sound advice. For both Steve and me, it is important that our players know that we are there for them, even after they step off the ice.<BR><BR>“For Steve, his career has been about instilling a hard work ethic, the importance of being a great teammate, commitment and dedication. Steve has shown kids that once you do this, the success of a season will take care of itself.” <BR><BR>
<P></P>
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG><EM>Note: </EM></STRONG><BR><BR>In Jacobs' 22 seasons, his teams have never had a losing campaign, and in all but one&nbsp;season reached the final eight. Twelve Cushing teams have reached the Final Four,&nbsp;five have reached the title game, and two won it all -- the 1996 and 1998 teams.<BR></FONT>&nbsp;<BR><BR></P><div class="article-divider"></div><BR>
