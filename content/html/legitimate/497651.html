		  <p><strong>- SOLID </strong>  RETREAT, Far North Queensland, early July 19-22, 2014. <a href="http://solidscreen.blogspot.com.au" target="_blank">http://solidscreen.blogspot.com.au</a> </p>
		  <p> 'Solid Ideas' was  an invitational yarning circle for Indigenous practitioners in a  residential retreat environment and 'Solid Screen' is an  International Indigenous Festival of the screen, open to the public.   'Solid Screen' will  include  a range of work from artists participating in the forum event that  reflects upon the discussions and dialogue that 'Solid Ideas' will  interrogate. The screening, like the forum, responds to important  transformations that have reconfigured opportunities for experimental  arts, remix and media practice, internationally, in recent times. </p>
		  <p> Within the programs streams of  activity, we aim to deliver Indigenous specific screen   components  to allow opportunities for Indigenous screen artists and artsworkers  to develop professionally, develop greater  understanding of new media and inter-disciplinary practices,  and gain critical feedback on personal projects. </p>
		  <p> The Far North of Australia has a great  depth of Indigenous arts practice, with a prolific visual arts  industry, and we wish to compliment this strength and provide  opportunities and experiences for Indigenous practitioners to engage  with other mediums for expression, and explore screen history in  Television and Filmmaking. There are a also number of number of  Indigenous artists already working in performance, installation,  video and photography mediums.

		  </p>
		  <p>Public  discussion about Indigenous film-making and the arts (by Indigenous  peoples) is rare in Queensland and in wider-Australia,  dialogue and writing about/for Indigenous Experimental and  Interdisciplinary Media Arts is urgently overdue, desperately needs  to occur and be encouraged.</p>
          <p align="left">At  issue is the translation to canvas, tape, celluloid and pixels to  create a specifically Indigenous cultural and social philosophy in  their respective art forms, the  history and future of Indigenous art practice in Australia.   A  lot of people are doing really interesting projects around the  country, and we thought it would be good to try and tie some of them  back together with a  series of workshops, discussions, panels, gigs and screenings.</p>
          <p align="left">Through  this process a wide variety of issues at the forefront of both the  political and conceptual agendas of these inter-disciplinary artists arose. </p>
