<br />
Lépine was born in Montreal, the son of a Canadian nurse and an Algerian-born businessman.  His father was abusive and contemptuous of women.   After his parents separated when he was seven, his mother returned to nursing to support her children. Lépine and his younger sister lived with other families, seeing their mother on weekends. Lépine was considered bright but withdrawn and having difficulties with peer and family relationships. He changed his name to Marc Lépine at the age of 14 giving as the reason his hatred of his father.

In 1986, he dropped out of the course in his final term, and was subsequently fired from his job at a hospital due to his poor attitude. He began a computer programming course in 1988, and again abandoned it before completion. Lépine twice applied for admission to the École Polytechnique, but lacked two required compulsory courses.<br />
<br />
After several months of planning, Lépine entered the École Polytechnique de Montréal, on the afternoon of December 6, 1989.  He had long complained about women working in non-traditional jobs, and after separating men and women in a classroom, he shot the women, claiming that he was fighting feminism.  He then moved into other parts of the building, targeting women as he went, before killing himself. His suicide note blamed feminists for ruining his life.<br />

Lépine's actions have been variously ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("68958",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("68958")' href="/topics/Personality_disorder">personality disorder</a><span class="hp" id="m68958"><div class="hpHeader">Personality disorder</div><div class="hpContent">Personality disorders, formerly referred to as character disorders, are a class of personality types and behaviors.

<H3> Childhood </H3>
Lépine was born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi on October 26, 1964 in Montreal, the son of Algerian&nbsp;immigrant Rachid Liass Gharbi and Canadian nurse Monique Lépine.  A mutual funds salesman, his father was travelling in the Caribbean at the time of his son's birth. During his absence, Monique Lépine discovered evidence that her husband had been having an affair.  Gharbi was a non-practicing Muslim, and Monique Lépine, a former Catholic nun who had rejected organized religion after she left the convent. Their son was baptized a Roman Catholic&nbsp;as an infant, but received no religious instruction during his childhood; his mother described her son as "a confirmed atheist all his life".  A daughter, Nadia, was born in 1967.<br />
<br />
Instability and violence marked the family: they moved frequently, and much of Lépine's early childhood was spent in <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("79012",this,"costa_rica.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("79012")' href="/topics/Costa_Rica">Costa Rica</a><span class="hp" id="m79012"><div class="hpHeader">Costa Rica</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i79012"></div>Costa Rica , officially the Republic of Costa Rica  is a multilingual, multiethnic and multicultural country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Caribbean Sea to the east....</div><br></span>&nbsp;and <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("54954",this,"puerto_rico.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("54954")' href="/topics/Puerto_Rico">Puerto Rico</a><span class="hp" id="m54954"><div class="hpHeader">Puerto Rico</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i54954"></div>Puerto Rico , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico , is an unincorporated territory of the United States, located in the northeastern Caribbean, east of the Dominican Republic and west of both the United States Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands.Puerto Rico  comprises an...</div><br></span>, where his father was working for a Swiss mutual funds company. The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led to the loss of much of the family's assets.  Gharbi was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and his children.  Gharbi had contempt for women and believed that they were only intended to serve men.  He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of the cries of their toddler.  He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son, and discouraged any tenderness, as he considered it spoiling. In 1970, following an incident in which Gharbi struck his son so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, his mother decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976. Following the separation, Lépine lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Gharbi defaulted on mortgage payments. Lépine was afraid of his father, and at first saw him on weekly supervised visits. The visits ended quickly, as Rachid Gharbi ceased contact with his children soon after the separation.  Lépine never again saw his father, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.<br />
<br />
After two payments, Gharbi stopped making support payments, and to make ends meet Monique Lépine returned to nursing. She subsequently started taking further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends. Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("5583",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("5583")' href="/topics/Centre_hospitalier_universitaire_Sainte-Justine">St. Justine's Hospital</a><span class="hp" id="m5583"><div class="hpHeader">Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine</div><div class="hpContent">The Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine   is a pediatric university health centre affiliated with the Université de Montréal, located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada...</div><br></span>&nbsp;in 1976; the assessment concluded there was nothing wrong with the shy and withdrawn Lépine, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.<br />
<H3> Adolescence </H3>
After the divorce became final in 1976, the children, then aged 12 and 9, returned to live with their mother, who was director of nursing at a Montreal hospital.  In 1977, the family moved to a house purchased in the middle-class&nbsp;Montreal suburb of <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("33411",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("33411")' href="/topics/Pierrefonds,_Quebec">Pierrefonds</a><span class="hp" id="m33411"><div class="hpHeader">Pierrefonds, Quebec</div><div class="hpContent">Pierrefonds was a city on the Island of Montreal.

Lépine attended junior high and high school, where he was described as a quiet student who obtained average to above average marks. He developed a close friendship with another boy, but he did not fit in with other students.  Taunted as an Arab because of his name, at the age of 14 he legally changed it to "Marc Lépine", citing his hatred of his father as the reason for taking his mother's surname.  Marc Lépine was uncommunicative, and showed little emotion. He suffered from low self-esteem, exacerbated by his chronic acne.  Family relations remained difficult; his younger sister Nadia publicly humiliated him about his acne and his lack of girlfriends. He fantasized about her death, and on one occasion made a mock grave for her.  He was overjoyed when in 1981 she was placed in a group home because of her delinquent behaviour and drug abuse. Seeking a good male role model for Lépine, his mother arranged for a Big Brother. For two years, the experience proved positive as Lépine, often with his best friend, enjoyed the time with photography and moto-cross motorcycles. However, in 1979 the meetings ceased abruptly when the Big Brother was detained on suspicion of molesting young boys. Both Lépine and his Big Brother denied that any molestation had occurred.<br />
Lépine owned an air rifle as a teenager, which he used to shoot pigeons near his home with his friend.  They also enjoyed designing and building electronic gadgets.  He developed an interest in <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("86552",this,"world_war_ii.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("86552")' href="/topics/World_War_II">World War II</a><span class="hp" id="m86552"><div class="hpHeader">World War II</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i86552"></div>World War II, or the Second World War , was a global conflict lasting from 1939 to 1945, involving most of the world's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis...</div><br></span>&nbsp;and an admiration of <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("37181",this,"adolf_hitler.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("37181")' href="/topics/Adolf_Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a><span class="hp" id="m37181"><div class="hpHeader">Adolf Hitler</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i37181"></div>Adolf Hitler  was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party , commonly referred to as the Nazi Party).

Lépine also took considerable responsibility at home, including cleaning and doing repairs while his mother worked.<br />

He later told his friend it was because of difficulties accepting authority, and in his suicide letter, noted that he had been found to be "anti-social".<br />
An official statement from the military after the massacre stated that he had been "interviewed, assessed and determined to be unsuitable".<br />
<H3>Adulthood</H3>
In 1982 at the age of 18, the family moved to Saint-Laurent, closer to his mother's work and to Lépine's new <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("18151",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("18151")' href="/topics/Cégep">CEGEP</a><span class="hp" id="m18151"><div class="hpHeader">Cégep</div><div class="hpContent">CEGEP  is an acronym for , which is literally translated as "College of General and Vocational Education" but commonly called "General and Vocational College" in circles not influenced by Quebec English.  It refers to the public post-secondary education collegiate institutions exclusive to the...</div><br></span>&nbsp;college. He lost contact with his school friend soon after the move. This period marks the beginning of the seven years which he described in his suicide note as having "brought [him] no joy".<br />
<br />
In August 1982, Lépine began a two year pre-university course in pure sciences at CEGEP Saint-Laurent, failing two courses in the first semester but improving his grades considerably in the second semester. He worked part-time at a local hospital where his mother was director of nursing, serving food and doing custodial work. He was seen as nervous, hyperactive, and immature by his colleagues. He developed an attraction to another employee, however he was too shy to act on his feelings. After a year at college, he switched from the university-destined science program into electronics technology, a three-year technical program geared more towards immediate employment. His teachers remembered him as being a model student, quiet, hardworking and generally doing well in his classes, particularly those related to electrotechnology.  There was an unexplained drop in his marks in the fall 1985 term, and in February 1986, during the last term of the program, he suddenly and without explanation stopped attending classes, as a result failing to complete his <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("31975",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("31975")' href="/topics/Diploma_of_Collegial_Studies">diploma</a><span class="hp" id="m31975"><div class="hpHeader">Diploma of Collegial Studies</div><div class="hpContent">The Diploma of College Studies  is issued by the province of Quebec, Canada at the completion of post-secondary studies at the college level.

<br />
He moved out of his mother's home into his own apartment, and in 1986 he applied to study engineering at École Polytechnique de Montréal. He was admitted on the condition that he complete two compulsory courses, including one in solution chemistry.   In 1987, Lépine was fired from his job at the hospital for aggressive behaviour, as well as disrespect of superiors, and carelessness in his work. He was enraged at his dismissal, and at the time described a plan to commit a murderous rampage and then commit suicide.  His friends noted that he was unpredictable, flying into rages when frustrated.<br />
<br />
In the fall of 1987, in order to complete his college diploma, Lépine took three courses, obtaining good marks in all, and in February 1988, began a course in computer programming at a private college in downtown Montreal, funding his studies with government student loans. He moved into a downtown apartment with his old high school friend, and in the winter of 1989 took a CEGEP night-course in solution chemistry, a prerequisite course for the École Polytechnique. Lépine wanted a girlfriend, but was generally ill at ease around women. He tended to boss women around and show off his knowledge in front of them. He spoke out to men about his dislike of feminists, career women and women in traditionally male occupations, such as the police force, stating that women should remain in the home, caring for their families. Lépine applied again to the École Polytechnique in 1989; however his application was rejected as he lacked required courses.  In March 1989 he abandoned the course in computer programming, though he performed well in the CEGEP course, obtaining 100% in his final exam. In April 1989 he met with a university admissions officer, and complained about how women were taking over the job market from men.<br />
<H2> Massacre </H2>
The massacre appeared to have been planned for several months if not longer.  In August 1989, Lépine picked up an application for a firearms-acquisition certificate and he received his permit in mid-October.  On November 21, 1989, Lépine purchased a Ruger Mini-14&nbsp;<a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("63573",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("63573")' href="/topics/Semi-automatic_rifle">semi-automatic rifle</a><span class="hp" id="m63573"><div class="hpHeader">Semi-automatic rifle</div><div class="hpContent">A semi-automatic rifle is a type of rifle that fires a single bullet each time the trigger is pulled, automatically ejects the spent cartridge, chambers a fresh cartridge from its magazine, and is immediately ready to fire another shot...</div><br></span>&nbsp;at a local sporting goods store.  Between October and December 1989, Lépine was seen at least seven times at the École Polytechnique. Four days before the shooting, he brought his mother a present, though it was several weeks before her birthday; he also brought a note and two bags of belongings, which she did not discover until long after the shooting. Lépine had always been very punctual paying his rent, but did not do so in December 1989.<br /><br />

On December 6, 1989, Lépine walked into the École Polytechnique de Montréal. There, he entered a second-floor classroom where he separated the men and women and then ordered the approximately fifty men to leave.

After this, Lépine moved to other areas of the building, including the cafeteria, corridors and another classroom. A total of fourteen women (twelve engineering students, one nursing student, and one university employee) were killed, and four men and ten women injured before Lépine turned the gun on himself. The event has been described as a "pseudo-community" type of "pseudo-commando" murder-suicide, in which the perpetrator targets a specific group, usually in a public place and intending to die in "a blaze of glory".<br />

A three-page letter was found in the pocket of his jacket.

The letter also contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because of their feminism.   Another letter, written to a friend, promised the explanation to the massacre lay by following clues left in Lépine's apartment. The hunt led only to a suitcase of computer games and hardware.<br />

Marc Lépine was buried in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges&nbsp;in Montreal, a few blocks from where he committed the massacre.<br />

<H2> Rationale </H2>
A police psychiatrist who interviewed Lépine's family and entourage, and who had access to his letters, suggested that he may have had a serious <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("97684",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("97684")' href="/topics/Personality_disorder">personality disorder</a><span class="hp" id="m97684"><div class="hpHeader">Personality disorder</div><div class="hpContent">Personality disorders, formerly referred to as character disorders, are a class of personality types and behaviors. Personality disorders are noted on Axis II of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-IV-TR  of the American Psychiatric Association.Personality disorders are...</div><br></span>, as he chose the multiple homicide/suicide strategy (killing one’s self after killing others) that is a characteristic of this disorder. The psychiatrist noted "extreme narcissistic vulnerability" as shown by fantasies of power and success combined with high levels of self-criticism and difficulties dealing with rejection and failure. Feelings of powerlessness and incompetence were compensated for by a violent and grandiose imaginary life.   Other psychiatrists suggested that Lépine was psychotic, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal (and absent) father, while at the same time unconsciously identifying with a violent manhood that dominates women. Other theories were that Lépine's experiences of abuse as a child had caused brain-damage or led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life. His mother speculated that Lépine may have suffered from <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("50826",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("50826")' href="/topics/Attachment_disorder">attachment disorder</a><span class="hp" id="m50826"><div class="hpHeader">Attachment disorder</div><div class="hpContent">Attachment disorder is a broad term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood, resulting in problematic social expectations and behaviors...</div><br></span>, due to the abuse and sense of abandonment he had experienced in his childhood. She also wondered whether Lépine viewed her as a feminist, and that the massacre might have been an unconscious attempt to get revenge for her neglect while she pursued her career, and for his sister's taunts.  Others take a less individualistic approach. Many feminists and governmental officials view it as an illustration of misogynist violence committed against women.  Criminologists consider the massacre as an example of a <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("76140",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("76140")' href="/topics/Hate_crime">hate or bias crime</a><span class="hp" id="m76140"><div class="hpHeader">Hate crime</div><div class="hpContent">In crime and law, hate crimes  occur when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her perceived membership in a certain social group, usually defined by racial group, religion, sexual orientation, disability, class, ethnicity, nationality, age, gender, gender identity, social status or...</div><br></span>&nbsp;against women.  A few men's rights activists seek to rehabilitate Lépine as hero of the anti-feminist cause. Others wondered if Lépine's actions were the result of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation or increased violence in the media and in society.<br />
