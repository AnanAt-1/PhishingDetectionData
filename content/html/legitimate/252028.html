<td>ARCOT Sowmya is Professor in the School of Computer Science
and Engineering at the University of New South Wales. She obtained her
PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology,
Bombay&nbsp; in 1992.&nbsp;
<p>Dr Sowmya teaches courses in computer vision
and learning , pattern recognition and robotics.&nbsp; These courses are
at the third and fourth year level, 
which are advanced electives at the fourth year level.
<p>Dr Sowmya's research is in two areas: image analysis and recognition,
and software engineering. The first area focuses on segmentation and
classification of images, with techniques drawn from machine learning, 
pattern recognition and statistical data analysis. A major application focus 
has been on 
feature extraction,
recognition and understanding of high resolution images, in particular
satellite and aerial images and medical images. Motion segmentation and
classification in video images in another major application area, in 
particular motion tracking in AVIE at the iCinema centre, and face tracking.
&nbsp; Past and current research
projects include road network extraction from high resolution aerial images
and digital maps, symbolic learning techniques for object recognition,
real-time resampling and tracking algorithms&nbsp; and motion tracking and
recognition
for interactive cinema and medical image understanding and diagnosis on
HRCT images of the lung.&nbsp;
<p>The second area of interest focuses on formal methods of specification,
verification and design of real-time, reactive and distributed systems.
Techniques are based on process algebras, temporal logic, simulation and
deduction. Past and current projects include&nbsp; verification of statecharts
using logic-based techniques, real-time (robot) control software development
using Esterel, design reuse techniques for component-based embedded
system development and protocol modelling and verification for on-chip communication protocols as well as web service protocols.
