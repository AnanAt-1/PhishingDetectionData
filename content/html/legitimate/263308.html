<EM> Designing and Building Parallel Programs (Online)</EM> integrates
four resources concerned with parallel programming and parallel
computing:

<UL>

<LI>The content of <A HREF="text/book.html">Designing and Building
Parallel Programs</A>

<LI>A collection of public-domain <A
HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/tools.html">Parallel Software
Tools</A>

<LI>A collection of <A
HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/dbpp/web-tours">Web Tours</A> providing

</UL>

<P>

<EM>We have prepared and presented a very successful <A
HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~itf/sc95/">full-day tutorial</A>
based on Designing and Building Parallel Programs.</EM> Let us know if
you are interested in seeing this presented elsewhere.
