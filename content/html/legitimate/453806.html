The duo, who have been friends since 1993, wrote a song that same day while still learning to play their instruments. After writing songs and coming up with the band name over an IM conversation, they tried for a year to get the band off the ground. Finding a drummer that could and wanted to play punk rock proved to be tougher than expected for the "music scene newbies".<br />
<br />
In March 2002 Allan Aguirre (<a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("46544",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("46544")' href="/topics/Scaterd_Few">Scaterd Few</a><span class="hp" id="m46544"><div class="hpHeader">Scaterd Few</div><div class="hpContent">Scaterd Few was a Christian punk band originating from Burbank, California.

But Allan needed a guitarist, bassist and drummer to make it happen. A mutual friend connected Chris, Brad and Allan and the same week the Greyskull guys joined Allan Aguirre and Accidental Siren Records for Scaterd Few's last release "<a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("19974",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("19974")' href="/topics/Omega_No._5">Omega No. 5</a><span class="hp" id="m19974"><div class="hpHeader">Omega No. 5</div><div class="hpContent">Omega No. 5 is the latest material by the punk band Scaterd Few.

<br />
From March 2002 until July 2002 Chris and Brad worked with Allan Aguirre to record the album and rehearse for shows. After only a handful of shows in Dallas and a trip to Cornerstone, it was clear that Scaterd Few wasn't going to continue forward, however, the experience with Scaterd Few proved to be exactly what they needed to get Greyskull off the ground. In August 2002 Chris and Brad wrote four new songs and recorded their first demo (Better Off Dead EP) with their new friend Joe Sidoti (who played drums and recorded "Omega No. 5" for Scaterd Few). A few months later they added drummer Josh Dacus and were set to hit the stage.<br />
<H3>2003-2005</H3>
In March 2003 with the new EP out and some experience on stage Greyskull played their first show ever at Dreamworld Music Complex in Arlington, Tx. The very next night they won a Battle of the Bands contest at The Door in Ft Worth. Kane Kelly filled in on guitar for both of those shows, however, Chris, Brad and Josh played as a three-piece for their next several shows. During the few shows performing as a three-piece, Greyskull met Robbie Estill and Roy Hudson while they were playing in their band, 10w30. Shortly after meeting, Robbie and Roy joined forces with Chris and Brad to form a solid line-up that lasted from July 2003-2006.<br />
<br />
During that time Greyskull played many shows around Texas and recorded their first full-length album, "State of Ruckus". They teamed-up again with friend, Joe Sidoti, who recorded the 14 song LP in a cabin on the banks of Lake Travis in <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("18717",this,"austin,_texas.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("18717")' href="/topics/Austin,_Texas">Austin, Texas</a><span class="hp" id="m18717"><div class="hpHeader">Austin, Texas</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i18717"></div>Austin is the capital city of the U.S. state of :Texas and the seat of Travis County.

Greyskull was flown to Singapore to perform at the N93i launch event in early January 2007 and went back to Singapore to play the campaign finale concert in April 2007. Footage of Greyskull from that concert was then edited and placed on music television stations in the eight participating markets as a Nokia N93i commercial/Greyskull music video (for the song “Pretty in Ink”).
