<P>

<B>Several years ago I was part of a project to arrange these Wilson County records for filming
by the Tennessee State Library and Archives. The project did not go forward because of lack of
help.<BR>
<P>
These abstracts are only a portion of the records that were located in a small vault in the
courthouse. At the time of this project, there were numerous boxes of Plea and Quarter Session
records stacked in the storage room. Those records dated to the beginning of the county and were
wonderful! I understand that there is now a preservation project for the loose records in Wilson
County.<BR>
<P>
These Chancery records were in numbered folders. The Clerk and Master wanted the numbers to
remain with the file. That number is located at the beginning of these abstracts. The boxes were
not all together, so the numbers are not consecutive.<BR>
<P>
Some abbreviations I have used are: A lower case "a" for acreage and lower case "p" for poles. 
(Ex. 62a 5p).<BR>

conducted a religious revival in the neighborhood of Burnell WALLS - there were a great many
comments and this revival resulted in building the Bartons Creek Church W. of Burnell WALLS
home on the Old Lebanon and Franklin road and E. of Bartons Creek, near where Joel
VANHOOK now lives. Since the war some time this church building was removed from its first
location some mile or more N. of the old site and near to John FIELDS.... I am well satisfied that
Bartons Creek Church, a Baptist Church was built between 1845 and 1850 and my best
recollection that it was 1847. I lived from my earliest recollection to the time I came to live in
Lebanon, about 1851 or 2 within three miles of the first location of Bartons Creek Church. My
best recollection is that "Union Campground" was made by the removal of Lebanon Station Camp
ground - the latter place was near the widow John PERKINS about 2 miles a little N. of W. from
Lebanon. I think this change was made after 1850, perhaps 1852, the new camp ground. I attend
at the first camp meeting and was well acquainted with it until the war come on." <BR>

1/2 miles of the gate on the pike, nearest Lebanon, I turned off of the road, to avoid the payment
of toll. They had been charging me 15 cents per load and I had been going through the gate, but
they raised the toll to 25 cents per load, and I went around the gate to avoid the payment of the
extra dime....I come over to the tater peeler road, and traveled that to Lebanon..."<BR>
