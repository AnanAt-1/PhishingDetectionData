Our funding agencies require that we charge a registration fee during
the course of the workshop. <b>Registration fees include participation in
the workshop, all workshop materials, breakfast, lunch, breaks and any
scheduled social events (if applicable)</b>.<p>

* College/University faculty and employees of nonprofit and government
organizations will automatically receive the reduced rate. Other
participants may apply for a <b>reduction of fees</b>. They should
email their request for the reduced fee to the Workshop Coordinator at
workshop@dimacs.rutgers.edu. Include your name, the Institution you
work for, your job title and a brief explanation of your
situation. All requests for reduced rates must be received before the
pre-registration deadline. You will promptly be notified as to the

<LI>Parking Permit<p>
Parking permits will be available at the registration table on the day of the workshop.<p>

Please park in <b>lot 64</b> located between the CoRE Building and the Werblin Recreation Center.
<p>

<li>  Important Reimbursement Information<p>
Attendees who have been offered support should keep two rules
in mind.  Reimbursement for air travel can only be made for
travel on <b> US Flag Carriers, REGARDLESS OF COST.</b>  (For example, travel on airlines such as
United, Continental, USAir, and others that are United States
based are allowable.  Travel on airlines such as Lufthansa, SAS, Air Canada 
and other airlines based outside the US cannot be reimbursed by DIMACS.)
<p>
The second rule to keep in mind is to get original receipts for
all reimbursable expenses.
