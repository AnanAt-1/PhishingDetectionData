                                    <div class="w75 left"><a title="COLTS - The Fifth Down Blog - NYTimes.com" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/colts/"><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v3/fifthdown/teams/colts75.jpg" alt="Inianapolis Colts"></a></div>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Last year, there was an unofficial national movement to declare the Indianapolis Colts old. People looked only at the unusually lengthy list of injuries striking this team and chalked it up to Father Time. Never mind
                                        that all of the key players who missed significant time &#x2013; tight end <strong>Dallas Clark</strong>, running back <strong>Joseph Addai</strong>, wide receivers <strong>Austin Collie</strong> and <strong>Anthony Gonzalez</strong>,
                                        safety <strong>Melvin Bullitt</strong>, linebacker Clint Session and cornerbacks <strong>Jerraud Powers</strong> and Kelvin Hayden &#x2013; were all, save for Clark, under 30 years old.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In truth, time &#xA0;<em>is</em> closing in on this team. But it&#x2019;s closing in on everybody. And, with 31-year-olds <strong>Dwight Freeney</strong> and <strong>Gary Brackett</strong> being the defensive elder
                                        statesmen but still firmly in their primes, it&#x2019;s fair to say that Father Time is chasing only the offense. Clark is 32. So are <strong>Reggie Wayne</strong> and right tackle <strong>Ryan Diem</strong>. The
                                        esteemed center <strong>Jeff Saturday</strong> is 36. And that guy who takes the snaps from Saturday is 35.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We can stop right here. Really, if Father Time wants to take down this franchise, he need only sack <strong>Peyton Manning</strong>. As 31 N.F.L. teams can attest, that&#x2019;s not easy. But for the first time in 14
                                        years, it doesn&#x2019;t seem impossible.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Manning spent virtually the entire off-season recovering from a second neck operation to correct a bulging disk. He originally said he wouldn&#x2019;t have even had the surgery if the lockout hadn&#x2019;t wiped out
                                        off-season team activities. But with nearly three months now gone by and Manning still not practicing (which is akin to you or I not eating or sleeping), our antennas of suspicion are effectively raised.<br>
                                        <span id="more-80231"></span><br> Still, this summer, the Colts owner <strong>Jim Irsay</strong> followed through on his mission to re-sign Manning long term and make him the highest-paid player in the N.F.L. Or
                                        he tried, anyway; Manning threw the organization a bone by signing on for five years at $90 million ($69 million the first over three years), which is a few hairs below his market value.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That&#x2019;s a considerable investment in a 35-year-old quarterback, but no one batted an eye, as it&#x2019;s common knowledge that Irsay didn&#x2019;t have a choice. The Colts&#x2019; organization can replace Coach
                                        Tony Dungy with <strong>Jim Caldwell</strong> and not skip a beat. It can endure significant player personnel moves like replacing, say, the superb Marvin Harrison with an unknown like <strong>Pierre Garcon</strong>.
                                        It can cycle through defensive personnel without much hiccup. It can stand to lose a longtime offensive assistant like Tom Moore (who left his consultant post and has now been completely replaced by the offensive
                                        coordinator <strong>Clyde</strong> <strong>Christensen</strong>). It can even handle a passing of the torch from the team president <strong>Bill Polian</strong> to his son <strong>Chris Polian</strong> without drifting
                                        from the blueprint that has led to seven A.F.C. South titles in eight years (we assume it can handle this, anyway; it&#x2019;s early in that transition, but so far so good).</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But what this organization cannot survive is a change under center. The Colts can survive all those other changes only&#xA0; <em>because</em> of who&#x2019;s under center. Lose Manning and that&#x2019;s it &#x2013;
                                        era over. So long, thanks for the memories. It was fun. All the best! Oh, and by the way, just a heads up: you&#x2019;ll probably be remembered as football&#x2019;s version of the Atlanta Braves. The 90s Braves,
                                        that is. Nothing personal or too pejorative, really. Just, you know, the consistent regular season dominance and lone world title.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is what the Colts are fighting from here on out. There is still plenty of time &#x2026; but yes, the clock&#x2019;s also ticking.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Offense</strong></p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We&#x2019;re not going to bother analyzing what this offense might be like if <strong>Dan Orlovsky</strong> or (Colts fans, cover your ears) <strong>Curtis Painter</strong> has to run the show for a little while. Just
                                        know it wouldn&#x2019;t be good. As for <strong>Peyton Manning</strong> running the show, there is no arguing against his magnificence. There was once a time when people questioned whether the presnap gyrations
                                        and neurotic preparation and attention to detail robbed this offense of its flexibility and personality. But that was many M.V.P.s and several 4,000-yard seasons ago.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The remaining scrap of doubters were hushed last season, when Manning posted career highs in yards and pass attempts to prove once and for all that he can carry this unit no matter which 10 guys line up with him. This
                                        year shouldn&#x2019;t be as challenging. <strong>Dallas</strong> <strong>Clark</strong> is back posing matchup problems off the line of scrimmage or out of the slot. And it&#x2019;s now known that his backup, <strong>Jacob</strong>                                        <strong>Tamme</strong>, has the fluidity and soft hands to beat linebackers underneath and even the occasional safety down the seams. Tamme isn&#x2019;t a good in-line blocker, though, so don&#x2019;t be surprised
                                        if the Colts use the more physical <strong>Brody</strong> <strong>Eldridge</strong> in their base two-tight-end sets.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At receiver, everyone is praying <strong>Austin</strong> <strong>Collie</strong>, victim of at least two nasty concussions late last fall, can stay safe for 16 games. The Colts would not put him back in the slot if
                                        they did not trust doctors who say he&#x2019;s fine. Collie has a good feel for seeing what Manning sees, which is what sets him apart from <strong>Blair White</strong>. If Collie is unavailable, the quicker <strong>Anthony Gonzalez</strong>                                        (barring one of his regularly occurring injuries) will get another opportunity to fulfill his first-round promise.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Starting outside receiver <strong>Pierre Garcon</strong> is one of the physically strongest catch-and-run weapons in the N.F.L. The Colts will need a breakout season from Garcon, a fourth-year pro, because, with the
                                        exception of center <strong>Jeff Saturday</strong>, none of their older veterans have shown as stark a decline as <strong>Reggie Wayne</strong>. This may sound preposterous considering Wayne is coming off a 111-catch,
                                        1,355-yard season. But in an offense as proficient as this, the numbers will always be there (especially when your quarterback attempts 679 passes). What&#x2019;s more important is how those numbers are obtained.
                                        Are they coming against double teams and coverages tilted his direction over the top? Or are they against a lot of soft zones, where a receiver can get by on timing and precision? This is not a rhetorical question
                                        &#x2013; there&#x2019;s an answer: zones. Wayne can still feast on zones. But in a private moment with all walls down, the Colts&#x2019; brass would probably tell you that Wayne is no longer explosive enough to
                                        consistently separate against quality man coverage. (Which may be why he has not received the long-term contract he desires.)</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">We&#x2019;ve seen the Colts succeed without an effective ground game before, but they would make life easier on themselves (and perhaps a little longer for Manning) if they had one. Most of Indy&#x2019;s rushing production
                                        comes from Manning audibling against a seven-man front. But in short-yardage situations, the futility of this front five, and specifically the painfully weak interior three, gets exposed.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Saturday is strictly a movement-oriented player at this point. He can&#x2019;t win many power battles. The second-year left guard <strong>Jacques McClendon</strong> is an unknown. It would be sensible for the second-round
                                        rookie <strong>Ben Ijalana</strong>, a gifted 317-pound right tackle at Villanova, to start inside ahead of the hard-working but overwhelmed <strong>Mike Pollak</strong>. But the Colts insist that Ijalana is strictly
                                        a tackle (and thus, relegated to backup duty for now). Too bad &#x2013; he would most likely be an upgrade over recent years&#x2019; fill-in starters <strong>Kyle DeVan</strong> and <strong>Jamey Richard</strong>.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It&#x2019;s a matter of time before the first-round rookie <strong>Anthony Castonzo</strong> starts ahead of the unqualified <strong>Jeff Linkenbach</strong> at left tackle. The long-armed <strong>Ryan Diem</strong>                                        is still one of the league&#x2019;s best right tackles but not quite the force he was a few years ago (hence the Ijalana pick).</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Fortunately, Manning is decisive in the pocket and does not need first-class blocking (defenses don&#x2019;t even bother game-planning to sack him; they focus only on making him move his feet before throwing &#x2013;
                                        something he&#x2019;s not always comfortable doing). Running back <strong>Joseph Addai</strong>, and especially the hesitant first-round bust <strong>Donald Brown</strong>, however, do need first-class blocking.
                                        Addai has unusual lateral acceleration that allows him to create his own wiggle room, but usually not until he breaks the line of scrimmage. Because he is a fervid pass-blocker and Brown a mechanical runner who
                                        is perhaps less effective than even the undrafted third-stringer <strong>Javarris James</strong>, Indy would probably love to ride the 28-year-old Addai as a three-down back in 2011. Problem is, he has never shown
                                        that kind of durability, which is why the Colts will probably use the fourth-round rookie <strong>Delone Carter</strong>.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Defense</strong></p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">It wouldn&#x2019;t be a gargantuan stretch to say that <strong>Dwight Freeney</strong> is as important to Indianapolis&#x2019;s defense as Manning is to Indianapolis&#x2019;s offense. This statement, though, held more
                                        water before the third-year defensive coordinator <strong>Larry Coyer&#x2019;s</strong> arrival, when this defense ran almost strictly zone schemes that relied on a straight four-man rush. To be clear, this is still
                                        a finesse unit built to take advantage of the fast Lucas Oil surface. But Coyer has incorporated more interior blitzes and eight-man run fronts into the early down packages, saving the club&#x2019;s hallmark Tampa
                                        2 concepts predominantly for long passing situations (which is really how the passive zone defense is meant to be played these days).</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">That said, take away Freeney (who, as of right now, is the best pure speed rusher <em>and</em> best pure bull rusher in the N.F.L.) and the high-speed fumble-forcing machine <strong>Robert Mathis</strong>, and this
                                        defense would be hurting. The Polians know their ends are essential to almost everything their defense does &#x2013; that&#x2019;s why they drafted 255-pound <strong>Jerry Hughes</strong> in the first round last
                                        year. (They may regret this pick, too, considering Hughes made about as much impact on this team last season as Danica Patrick.)</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The absence of off-season team activities prevented the coaching staff from getting a good look at the third-round rookie <strong>Drake Nevis</strong> and whatever undrafted gems they probably would have uncovered (Indy
                                        always find one or two). Thus, to augment depth along the defensive front, the Colts took the unusual step (for them) of signing the free agents <strong>Jamaal</strong> <strong>Anderson </strong>and <strong>Tommie Harris</strong>.
                                        Although disappointing as a first-rounder in Atlanta, Anderson is a premier run-stopping end who can offer 15 quality snaps a game. Harris can do the same as an explosive interior pass rusher. It is apparent, though,
                                        that his long-ailing knee will not allow him to recapture his every-down All-Pro form. Because of this, the underappreciated and energetic 26-year-olds <strong>Fili Moala</strong>, <strong>Eric Foster</strong> and
                                        <strong>Antonio</strong> <strong>Johnson</strong> will handle a bulk of the work at defensive tackle.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Colts&#x2019; fast-flowing style against the run can lead to stops on the outside but also open the door to plenty of 7- and 8-yard gashes. In this scheme, the strong safety is often counted on to allay these gashes.
                                        If healthy, <strong>Melvin Bullitt</strong> is up to task. While no Bob Sanders, Bullitt, a undrafted fifth-year pro, is one of the fastest run attackers in football. He benefits from operating alongside a free
                                        safety with superb run-pass recognition in <strong>Antoine Bethea</strong>. Instincts and familiarity allow Bethea to play with much better range than his fairly ordinary athleticism suggests he should.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As important as Bullitt and Bethea are in the box, stopping the run still comes down to middle linebacker <strong>Gary Brackett</strong> and his two outside mates. Last year&#x2019;s second-round pick, <strong>Pat Angerer</strong>,
                                        has the recognition skills and physicality to be a long-term cog on the strong side. He has a tad more speed than you would guess but is still not fast enough to play Will linebacker in this scheme. But last year&#x2019;s
                                        seventh-rounder, <strong>Kavell Conner</strong>, may have the requisite speed. Conner, a supple athlete who sees the field fairly well, will get a chance to work ahead of the utility backup <strong>Phillip Wheeler</strong>.
                                        The Colts also signed the free agent <strong>Ernie Sims</strong>, but he gets lost in coverage and probably will not earn the trust of the linebackers coach <strong>Mike Murphy</strong>.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As for the rest of the coverage, the third-year pros <strong>Jerraud Powers</strong> and <strong>Jacob Lacey</strong> will be asked to headline a razor-thin cornerbacking group. Powers is a physical underneath defender
                                        but does not have the quickness to regularly make big plays. Lacey is similar, only less assertive when the ball is in the air. On most teams, Lacey would be a fringe nickel back. But most teams don&#x2019;t have
                                        guys like the utterly untested <strong>Kevin Thomas</strong> (missed all of his 2010 rookie season with a knee injury) or the special teams veteran <strong>Justin Tryon</strong> vying for serious snaps.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Special Teams</strong></p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Adam Vinatieri</strong> is pretty good in the clutch. You know punter <strong>Pat</strong> <strong>McAfee</strong> is good if he can get arrested for public intoxication during the season and still remain part
                                        of this family-values organization. This year he may get a chance at kicking long-distance field goals.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The Colts&#x2019; return games have always been one of the most boring things in professional football &#x2013; right up there with the fullback handoff and halftime interviews. Because of this, we will no longer bother
                                        listing their return guys&#x2019; names (they change from week to week anyway).</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Put &#x2019;em down for at least 10 wins and, more likely, 12 or 13. It is surprisingly easy to forget, but the last time this team stayed healthy, it started 14-0 and reached the Super Bowl. The lockout figures to
                                        favor clubs that have built familiar, successful systems over the years. Thus, the question is: Is this system familiar enough to operate without Manning having practiced in it for six months?</p>
