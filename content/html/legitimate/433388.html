                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Friday, Drew was asked by a reporter if he recruits the way he does because he had to rebuild the Baylor program. The Bears were on probation for five years through this season for N.C.A.A. violations that
                                                were discovered in an investigation prompted by the 2003 murder of a player, Patrick Dennehy, by a former teammate.</p>

                                                player, we&#x2019;re going to recruit them. We&#x2019;re not going to say, &#x2018;Well, he&#x2019;s not going to come to our school or he&#x2019;s going to go to this school or that school.&#x2019; Our
                                                job is to recruit elite players and bring them to our school.</p>

We&#x2019;re smart enough to know that if you don&#x2019;t have good players, you&#x2019;re not a good
                                                coach.&#x201D;

The Bears get 11th-seeded Old Dominion
                                                on Saturday in the South Region. </p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Asked if he feels that his fellow Big 12 coaches are not supportive of him and his methods, he said he received text messages of &#x201C;Congratulations&#x201D;, &#x201C;Good luck&#x201D;, and &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll
                                                be cheering for you&#x201D; before and after the game.</p>

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Until their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/sports/ncaabasketball/15missouri.html?ref=sports">73-60 setback to third-seeded Missouri</a>, the ninth-seeded Bears had been all the rage here at the
                                                Ford Center. But among Big 12 coaches, there have been rumblings about Bears Coach Scott Drew.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On Saturday, I wrote an article about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/sports/ncaabasketball/15baylor.html?ref=sports">Baylor&#x2019;s hiring of Dwon Clifton</a> in July as its director of player
                                                development, a newly created position. He is the former A.A.U. coach of John Wall, a point guard from Raleigh, N.C., who is the nation&#x2019;s top high school player in the 2009 class.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Wall is considering Baylor along with Duke, Kansas, Memphis, Miami and North Carolina State. Drew did not want to talk about Clifton&#x2019;s hiring and Baylor declined requests to interview Clifton.</p>
                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Texas Coach Rick Barnes spoke openly about his adversarial relationship with Drew and his disapproval of A.A.U. coaches of top recruits being hired by universities, a practice that is becoming more common.</p>

                                            <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Drew has a reputation in college basketball circles for recruiting by talking negatively about other schools.</p>

                                                need to be done.&#x201D;</p>
