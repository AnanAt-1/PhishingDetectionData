					<div class="content"><p>In continuing with the theme of understanding error messages I'll discuss the "login failed" messages that are surfaced by the client and written to the server's error log (if the auditlevel is set to log failures on login which is the default) in the event of an error during the login process.</p>
<p>If the server encounters an error that prevents a login from succeeding, the client will display the following error mesage.</p>
<p>Msg 18456, Level 14, <strong>State 1</strong>, Server &lt;server name&gt;, Line 1<br>
Login failed for user '&lt;user name&gt;'</p>
<p>Note that the message is kept fairly nondescript to prevent information disclosure to unauthenticated clients. In particular, the 'State' will always be shown to be '1' regardless of the nature of the problem. To determine the true reason for the failure, the administrator can look in the server's error log where a corresponding entry will be written. An example of an entry is:</p>
<p>2006-02-27 00:02:00.34 Logon Error: 18456, Severity: 14, <strong>State: 8</strong>.</p>
<p>2006-02-27 00:02:00.34 Logon Login failed for user '&lt;user name&gt;'. [CLIENT: &lt;ip address&gt;]</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>The key to the message is the 'State' which the server will accurately set to reflect the source of the problem. In the example above, State 8 indicates that the authentication failed because the user provided an incorrect password. The common error states and their descriptions are provided in the following table:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col>

I am having the same error. &nbsp;The database engine will not allow any logons. &nbsp;The other engines seem to be fine. &nbsp;This still means that I do not have permissions for any of the databases. &nbsp;This is using local or domain accounts. &nbsp;<br><br>I created this problem by detaching one database running on the server. &nbsp;I went to connect the datafiles and I cannot get into the server at all.</p>

When you say "Same Error" I am assuming you mean:<br><br> &nbsp;Error is 18456, Severity: 14, State: 8. <br><br>This error is pretty clear, means that the password supplied does not match the password given. &nbsp;Note that passwords in SQL 2005 are case-sensitive, this could be an issue.<br><br>If you are a local administrator to the computer, then you should always be able to log into SQL.<br><br>Also, try using the admin port if the normal ports are not working, for example, to connect to local default instance:<br><br> &nbsp;sqlcmd -E -Sadmin:.<br><br>To connect to local named instance:<br><br> &nbsp;sqlcmd -E -Sadmin:.Instance1<br></p>

Thanks so much for your help.<br><br>I was able to use SQLCMD to gain access and rebuild access for my database <br>admin account. &nbsp;I was then able to use this account to reattach the detached <br>database. &nbsp;When I did this the database and all user access to SQL2005 was <br>back to normal. &nbsp;I am not sure why this happened. &nbsp;We have about ten other <br>databases on this SQL server. &nbsp;The same users had access to these tables as <br>well as the detached table so the detached table was not the only table for <br>which they had access. &nbsp;The detached table was just a table of 'production' <br>data. &nbsp; <br><br>I will try and see if I can recreate the problem but will wait for <br>the weekend to try that!<br></p>

Regarding 'State: 1', are you running SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server 2000? &nbsp;Supportability improvements were made to 2005 to make the states more unique but 2000 still reports 'State: 1' in every case.<br><br>- Vaughn</p>

we're running SQL Server 2005 CTP. server authentication is set to "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode". when connecting using windows accounts everything is fine, but any attempt to connect as e.g. 'sa' fails with this 'State: 1' error message... greets, rm</p>

Another question, are you looking at the error message state that the client receives or the error message state in the server error log? &nbsp;By default the server error log is at "C:Program FilesMicrosoft SQL ServerMSSQL.1MSSQLLOGERRORLOG". &nbsp;Also, you mentioned you're running at SQL2K5 CTP rather than RTM. &nbsp;Which CTP are you using? &nbsp;If you're using an old CTP it may be the case that unique state improvement hadn't yet been made.</p>

We just migrated to a new sql server with SQL Server 2005 installed (we moved from 2000).
We are experiencing two issues that we cannot resolve:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The site and database clients that use this SQL Server run very slow now. We have noticed that the lsass.exe process consistantly uses 25% CPU, +/- 10%. When we stop SQL server the lsass.exe process goes down to 0. What can be causing this? The website uses a SQL user account, not a windows user account.</li>
<li>We have an error in the event log that might be related to the issue above. It appears every few minutes:
Event Type: Failure Audit
Event Source: MSSQLSERVER
Event Category: (4)
Event ID: 18456

The error log from SQL gives more info:
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16.
What is causing this? How can this be traced?
I am stuck here. All help greatly appreciated.

Moshe,
&nbsp;One of the improvements in SQL 2005 is that all logins are always encrypted using SSL. If you have frequent connection logins, you will see lsass being quit <em>active</em>. Is it your case?
For the error in the ERRORLOG, the STATE tell that the process doesn't have permission of the login database. It apears to use NT authentication, running as localsystem. You can find who is trying to login from your local machine and go from there...</p>

I have added retry logic in my code which keeps on retrying the connection for the configurable amount of time, when I get this error I can see in my application log that its retrying the connection and most of the time it passes after 2 - 3 attempts but some time it goes up to 9-10 attempts so I feel it to be unreliable in the live system. Can some one please help me why this error occurs or is there any patch to resolve this issue.</p>

I was getting the same error, and I try everything listed on the Forum, and could not get rid of the error. It looks like there is some funkiness on the ODBC Connection, and it will always use the current user logged on the computer, not the specified SQLSever account, to send over the network for the connection profile.
To eliminate the error, I had to grant the Domain Users access to the SQL Database the program was trying to connect to. In my case, all users had access to the database, but security settings can be put in place to limit the usersâ access.
In other words, I could not fixed the problem, so I had to make a workaround.</p>

Like every one else, I was frustrated by the strange 18456 error with State=8. I store my password in a textfile, and when I need it, I do a copy and paste into the password field. I use a password something like "Ity@1%6$9#g".
I tried a number of "strangies", but this one worked on more than one occasion: using the direction arrow key pointing left, I moved the cursor back to the beginning of the password. It worked!
Try this at home, folks, it does not hurt a bit, and perhaps it might give the Microsoft boys a hint about the nature of the problem if you report the results.</p>

Hi Shawn,
State 16 indicates that target database could not be determined. &nbsp;This may mean that the specified database is non-existent, you do not have permissions on the database, or the database may not be online. &nbsp;Also, you can do as Matt mentioned in his comments on March 14 -- try connecting to a different database and then use the USE DATABASE to the problematic database and see what the error is.

I am getting the state 16 error, but it is not recurring. &nbsp;However there is a separate partition on the server that holds the logfiles which I noticed have not changed since the last time I received the state 16 error. &nbsp;Also the partition is almost to capacity. &nbsp;Are these two problems related or do the logfiles not overwrite themselves? &nbsp;I will go ahead and apologize for dumb questions. &nbsp;I have no experience in SQL and my job requires me to administer an enterprise GIS database!</p>

Had same problem state 14, I am running SQL 2005 dev edition with SP1, after some playing around I my user account didn't have access to the MSSQL folder, I found by running the SQL Server Management studio as 'administrator' from the right click menu all works fine.Very odd though as I installed SQL from my user which is an administrator, looks like vista handles user differently.</p>

Hi, I'm getting a state 1 error with SQL Server 2005 Express - I've followed links from this forum but so far have had no luck at all in finding an answer (or even a cause!)
Help!</p>

Hi,
I have SQL 2000 SP 4 running with both SQL &amp; Windows Auth. selected.
The moment I open Enterprise Manager from a computer that is not on the domain I get the following errors in the NT eventlog although I am using SQL Auth in Ent. Manager:
Logon attempt by:	MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0
Logon account:	[Remote NT User ID]
Source Workstation:	[Remote Workstation Name]
Error Code:	0xC0000064
Logon Failure:
Reason:		Unknown user name or bad password
User Name:	[Remote NT User ID]
Domain:		[Remote Workstation Name]
Logon Type:	3
Logon Process:	NtLmSsp
Authentication Package:	NTLM
Workstation Name:	[Remote Workstation Name]
Caller User Name:	-
Caller Domain:	-
Caller Logon ID:	-
Caller Process ID:	-
Transited Services:	-
Source Network Address:	10.2.5.16
Source Port:	0
I was under the impression that the whole point of SQL Auth. is not to try and Aut. the local logged on user?
Any pointers would be appreciated.

Hi,all.
I got an error state 1.
I created a user called "sa"(because there was no system admin) and I tried to connect to the db engine with this user,but I can't.
"Login failed for user 'sa'. The user is not associated with a trusted SQL Server connection. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 18452)" is displayed.
How can I connect?
please inform me to realhermes618@gmail.com</p>

You probably don't have mixed mode security enabled on your SQL Server. &nbsp;By default only integrated security is allowed.
Open SQL Server Management Studio and right click on the instance node in the Object Explorer and select Properties. &nbsp;Click on Security page and ensure that "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode" option is selected. &nbsp;Press OK and restart SQL.</p>

Hi,
I have SQL server 2005 enterprise edition and IIS &nbsp;server 6.0 on one machine, and trying to connect through ASP which uses the IUSR_machinename account.
I get error message 'login failed' and the serverlog shows state 11. That is great, but I haven't found any additional information as to solve this. &nbsp;'server access failure' sounds pretty obscure. Any ideas how to resolve this ?
THanks so much in advance,

Hi All,
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16 happened on my server when the owner of the files on the file system is not a user in SQL Server. I had the following scenario:
I imported a database, and specified the name of the imported database in a connection string. This failed to connect with the login failed message, but worked when I connected via master and specified "Use Database" within my query as suggested by Il-Sung.
When trying to generate database diagrams I was then told that the database did not have a valid owner, but when I right clicked on the databse properties an owner (sa) was listed. However, when I looked at the files owner, there was none specified.
To correct this problem in SQL Sever 2005, do the following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Open SQL Server Management Studio</li>
<li>Expand Databases</li>
<li>Right Click on the Database with problems and choose 'Properties'</li>
<li>Left Click the 'Files' node</li>
<li>Ensure that an appropriate owner is listed, if none is then set it
That resolved the issue with the database that I had this error with.
Hope this helps,
Nick</li>
</ol>

I'm getting this error trying to connect a service to the database and the user I've verified has access to the database that it's trying to connect to. &nbsp;Is there something I need to do differently for a service? &nbsp;The service is related to MOSS 2007. &nbsp;It's the Microsoft Single Signon Service. &nbsp;Any suggestions?

&nbsp;I'm seeing error state 23 repeatedly in my logs:
âError: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 23.â
&nbsp;Despite some scouring of the Web and MSDN I could find no information about this one. &nbsp;Please &nbsp;post the answer if possible.</p>

State 23 is pretty rare. &nbsp;What this means is the server was in the process of shutting down and at the same time some user was trying to log in. &nbsp;SQL blocks new users from logging in when the server is shutting down. &nbsp;So if you have fairly consistent logins I would expect to see this one from time to time when the server is shut down, it's harmless.</p>

The username and password you pass in as -U and -P are SQL Server usernames and passwords, not Windows usernames and passwords.
So you cannot say:
sqlcmd -S machine_name -U machine_nameuser_name -P user_password
If you want to log in as a specific Windows user, then you need to shell a command prompt as that user and use:
sqlcmd -S machine_name -E
You can shell a cmd prompt by using the RunAs command, like so:
C:&gt;runas /user:machine1user1 cmd.exe
Enter the password for machine1user1:
Attempting to start cmd.exe as user "machine1user1" ...
This will open a new cmd window and from there you can run sqlcmd -S server -E

States 11 and 12 simply mean the Windows user coming in does not have login access to the server. &nbsp;SQL Server validated the Windows user's token, figured out who it is, but the Windows user has not been granted access to the server.</p>

I tried to log in Database engine but it doesn't allow me to. &nbsp;It keeps giving me this message:
An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server. &nbsp;When connecting to SQL Server 2005, this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server does not allow remote connections.

Ok,
I just installed Sql Server Deveplopment Edition along with SP2 on Vista. The login method chosen at the time of installation was Windows Authentication.
Installation was successful but I can not connect to Database engine and keep getting "Login failed for user" with State being 11 (sql error log). The sql server related services are running under LocalSystem account.
Any ideas?</p>

Error 18456
Severity 14
State 16
SQL 2005 SP2
Mixed Mode
Failed login is a domain account but the error message says the client is &lt;local machine&gt;
Also, the failed login successfully logs in many times during the day.
There are no error messages in the SQL Agent log, just the SQL Server logs. Profiler didn't pick up any unsuccessful logins(despite the login failure showing up every minute on the SQL Server logs). I've confirmed that the same user account successfully &nbsp;logins to all of the databases that it's mapped to. No user complaints, just tons of failed login attempts in the SQL logs. &nbsp;
I'm stumped.</p>

Wow, I can't believe I resolved this issue by luck!
I encountered this error on my local machine. &nbsp; So what I did was ...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Logon to SQL Server using windows authentication.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Right click in the query window that appears and select "Open Server in Object Explorer"</li>
<li>&nbsp;Go to object explorer and open the "Security" folder and then the "Logins" folder.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Double-click the "sa" user and change the password. &nbsp; Also, like another user mentioned above, untick the "Enforce Password Policy" in addition to resetting the password.
Now if you will all excuse me, &nbsp; I must go and play with myself.</li>

Hi,
We use Sql Server 2000 SP4 on Windows 2000 SP4. The audit level is set to login failure for this server but we don't get any state informpation in the log file. here is an extract of the log file :
2007-06-19 15:45:02.45 logon &nbsp; &nbsp; Ãchec de la connexion de l'utilisateur 'sa'.
2007-06-19 15:45:22.17 logon &nbsp; &nbsp; Ãchec de la connexion de l'utilisateur 'sa'.
2007-06-19 15:45:35.07 logon &nbsp; &nbsp; Ãchec de la connexion de l'utilisateur 'sa'.
2007-06-19 15:46:21.01 logon &nbsp; &nbsp; Ãchec de la connexion de l'utilisateur 'sa'.
Do you have an idea why I don't see any "state information" in the log file. I need this information to understand why I get this connection error.
By the way, the connection is OK 99% of the time and Sql Server is used by an ASP web application.
Best regards,
Olivier</p>

Like every one else, I was frustrated by the strange 18456 error with State=8. I store my password in a textfile, and when I need it, I do a copy and paste into the password field. I use a password something like "Ity@1%6$9#g".
I tried a number of "strangies", but this one worked on more than one occasion: using the direction arrow key pointing left, I moved the cursor back to the beginning of the password. It worked!
Try this at home, folks, it does not hurt a bit, and perhaps it might give the Microsoft boys a hint about the nature of the problem if you report the results.
thanks bertie,this worked for me</p>

Matt I'm assuming your comment is directed at my post. I understand what State=16 means, the issue is that it is only occurring when the machine is booting. My Windows service has a dependency on SQLServer so starts only after SQLServer has started. However I consistently get a login failure at boot time but when I subsequently login the Windows service can be started manually without any problem. I guess what I'm looking for is feedback on whether there is a workaround for this issue. I have seen a number of posts on the web about the issue but I haven't yet seen a good solution. The one solution I have seen is modifying the dependent service to loop with a delay for a period while trying to connect at startup. This is not a solution that will work for my environment as the Windows Service is a third party product (and no I cannot go back to the vendor and ask them to insert a delay at startup).</p>

This can happen for example if your company has auditing software running and checking if your SQL Server has weak passwords. &nbsp;I see this periodically on my network. &nbsp;Our IT group has a process that scans for SQL Servers and then attempts to log into these using weak sa passwords to detect insecure SQL Servers.
Look at the source ip address and run ping -a &lt;ip&gt; to determine the source of the requests.</p>

Hi,
We've currently in the process of changing web hosts, and are having to move our databases to SQL Server 2005. In a trial run we tried to copy a database from our local SQL Server 2000 development machine to our hosted SQL Server 2005 machine. We got a 'login timeout' error when the package was being built. So, having installed SQL Server 2005 Developer edition on my local machine we're running tests trying to use the copy database wizard to copy a database between two SQL Server 2005 machines. We've had ports opened on both firewalls for this traffic, and have ensured that remote connections are allowed. We've located the error logs, and the following error is listed:
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 8.
Now, thanks to this article I understand that this is a password mis-match, but what I don't understand is why! The passwords have been entered correctly (including case). I've tried changing the password via the Management Studio, and other suggestions here, but still no joy. &nbsp;This is delaying our migration of sites and databases. If we just import the data from the existing server to the new one we lose all Primary Key information, and any defaults set for certain fields - information we need to retain as we bring the databases back to the local machine on a regular basis as part of our backup strategy. Can you help us to get this working?
Thanks</p>

I have added the sqlserver 2005 instance using sp_addlinkedserver. And when I try to use the linked server inside my query it says login failed for user 'sa'. When I checked at the error log on remote server(where the SQL Server 2005 is installed) the State was 8.
But I am able to connect to the SQL Server instance from Mgmt Studio Express and also using openrowset distributed queries.
Can I know the actual problem?</p>

I am getting Error 18456 State 8 sporadically for many users. Sometimes they can log on OK, and sometimes not, using the same password. The logins and passwords were migrated from SQL2000 using sp_help_revlogins.
If I change the password, they can log on using the new password, but later that same new password is rejected. If they try again later, it may work again!</p>

I'm having the same problem as Ken. &nbsp;My databases were restored to sql 2005 server and are in 2000 compatibility mode. &nbsp;Usually the logins work but occasionally for no apparent reason I get Error 18456 State 8. &nbsp;I know the password is correct as it is coming from the config file and not changing.
I tried deleting the users and recreating them by hand but still have the same sporadic problem.</p>

I think you will find that you have a sql security group or user which has a default database set which it no longer has access to.
If you look in the logs are you getting a successful login followed immediately by a failed login? that's what I had and it was a local group that the user was a member of which had that error. Gave public access to the db and done.</p>

I receive this error in the following scenario:
A user account had acces to 2 databases on the same SQL server via windows group membership.
I deleted the first database (and the corresponding log in) between the time the user had logged on to the domain and the starting of the "SQL server management studio". The connection to the SQL Server was made trough the memebership of the group of wich the login was deleted.
Solution: User logged off and on (windows) and the correct group was used to connect to the SQL server.</p>

Alright, we've fixed the problem with connecting with SQL Server. User can now successfully Open and connect using Management Studio. I checked the directory for where the error log should be but when I hover my mouse over the folder, it tells me that the folder is empty (and I can't access it). Just to double check, does this sound like a correct path for the errorlog:
C:Program FilesMicrosoft SQL ServerMSSQL.1MSSQLERRORLOG [Should be here]
Because it's not there.
Thanks for your help by the way.</p>

I created a login and assigned it to the sysadmin role on my local server, after which I restared the server. Also, I changed the max number of concurrent users allowed to 1. Now when I try connecting to the server, I get the error message, 'Connection was successfully established with server but an error occured durin the login process'. When I check the error log the following is noticed "Error: 17809, Severity: 20, State: 3. Could not connect because the maximum number of '1' user connections has already been reached. The system administrator can use sp_configure to increase the maximum value. The connection has been closed." I tried changing the max number of user connections allowed by using sqlcmd utility. In the command prompt it says value changed from 1 to 10, but when i try to log in to the server i get the same old error.</p>

I believe we have an answer for the Severity: 14 and State: 16, while using SharePoint Server 2007.
While attempting to enable SSO for the first time, if you fail to configure the Microsoft Single Sign-on Service with the proper 'Service Account' you will get an error. It seems that SharePoint creates a job looking for the 'SSO' database, even though it failed to create it - reason for State:16.
Steps we took to correct the issue:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Opened Windows Services</li>
<li>Configured Microsoft Single Sign-on Service to use the proper account</li>
<li>Opened Central Administration &gt;&gt; Operations &gt;&gt; Manage settings for single sign-on</li>
<li>Configured properties to use the same account used for Microsoft 'Single Sign-on Service'
The database (SSO) was created successfully and all the Error: 18456 went away. Hopefully this works for all of you that were experiencing the same issue.</li>

Hi,
After we upgrade some dev instances to SQL 2005 SP2 build 3215 i got the error when trying to connect with SQL authentication (Windows Authent is working for me, but not for others). I cannot assure somebody didnt type a wrong password.
But after a while, everything is working fine again....
Is there a process that locks the connection on an instance after a failed logon attempt ????</p>

Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16.
I found the other posts very helpful. &nbsp;Using Windows authentication on a local admin account which had sql 2005 sysadmin privileges, our install scripts would intermittently fail. &nbsp;The scripts would detach, copy and attach mdfs from one server to a different server. &nbsp;Sometimes it worked. &nbsp;Sometimes it failed. &nbsp;
What needed to be done is to refresh/resynchronize Server metadata with database metadata. &nbsp;Critically important, it seems, is to re-establish a link between the database owner of the newly attached db to an existing server login. &nbsp;
The upgrade scripts were obviously erroneous in this regard and this bug, which existed for YEARS and was latent from versions SQL 7.0 through SQL 2000, decided to announce its presence in the data migration from SQL 2000 to SQL 2005.
Thanks to everyone who have taken the time to contribute. &nbsp;It helped alot.</p>

Here's a different twist. I am running SQL Server 2005 and using Netapp storage devices for the databases. As a part of the configuration I have a seperate connection to the netapp devices using a VLAN on the switch. This connection is where all communications between the netapp and the windows OS happens for controlling disk IO. I just discovered that my System Administrator account is attempting to authenticate over the Netapp data connection rather than over the primary LAN connection. The only other database that I have running seems to be working just fine. I was attempting to install a new application which would fail when it tried to create the database due to a login failure. The 'data' vlan is not routed at all so it was unable to authenticate against the DC and the install/create db failed. Is there a way to tell SQL Server to only use the primary LAN connection to authenticate with the DC?
This is a rather truncated question as I realize that I have left out a lot of detailes - this is in the interests of brevity. If anyone has any ideas about this and would like more information I will provide more details as necessary. Basically I have two NICS functioning on two diferent Networks and want to be sure that SQL server only looks to a specific NIC/LAN for authentication.
Thanks in advance for any assistence someone/anyone can provide.

Hello,
I have a question. &nbsp;We have two SQL 2005 boxes in our dev environment. &nbsp;Our Active Directory is housed on a SBS 2003 server, which has recently been rebuilt. &nbsp;After we brought the rebuilt SBS server back online, we began to see weird permissions issues. &nbsp;Currently, our SQL boxes use Windows Authentication and Kebros.
The problem we're experiencing (seemingly after the SBS 2003 server rebuild) was that many of our linked server objects between the two SQL servers began to fail.
The errors we're seeing are:
Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITYANONYMOUS LOGON'. &nbsp;Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 11.
The Linked Server properties are set to use the "login's currentl security context", meaning you should be connecting across servers as yourself (windows authentication). &nbsp;All of this worked last week, but after the SBS rebuild its all failing. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

Hi, Patrick
I would recommend you check out Nan's blog entry on this error for linked servers:
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sql_protocols/archive/2006/08/10/694657.aspx" data-linktype="external">http://blogs.msdn.com/sql_protocols/archive/2006/08/10/694657.aspx</a>
Since you recently rebuilt your Active Directory server and don't indicate that you changed anything in the SQL Server instances, I would first:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that the Active Directory accounts that are used to log in to SQL Server do not have the following property set in Active Directory: Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated</li>
<li>Make sure that the Active Directory accounts that each SQL Server service runs under are trusted for delegation in Active Directory.</li>

Dan,
Thanks. &nbsp;I did just realize something, the links work when I remote desktop into the server and check the link to the other server... &nbsp;They fail when I use SQL studio on my desktop and test the link objects. &nbsp;That's a double-hop versus a single-hop, mentioned in the article you reference.... which makes it a Kebros problem I'm thinking. &nbsp;I'm going to keep digging. &nbsp;Let me know if you have any more ideas, and thanks for responding!

For State 11 errors the Domain account (DomainWinNTlogin for example) was accessing SQL Server fine and then at some point we experienced the State 11 errors (maybe related to Mirror Failover or some other issues on the server). &nbsp;I had to drop the Account from the Local Admin group and this stopped the errors occurring and then I added the account back in to the Local Admin group and errors did not return.</p>

Hi there,
I've written a service that connects to a SQL-Server 2005 (Express) database. The service works fine but two times a day I receive an error:
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16
Login failed for user 'wtime'. [CLIENT: &lt;local machine&gt;]
The error mostly occurs at 9:30 pm and 2:00 am but not always. May a backup-program cause the problem. I read that maybe the database is offline at the moment, but how could this be if this were the reason? After getting this error, the service itself tries to connect to the db as long as neccessary, and so I was able to see in the log files that the db is not available for just about 1 min, after this period of time the service is able to reconnect to the database again. I also found an article describing how to disable a service-job that cleans up no more used sessions, but no jobs are running on the sql-server.
Let me know if you have any ideas to solve the problem.</p>

Is the SQL Express offline at that time? If so, it's a by-design behavior for SQL Express. Please check this forum post see if it applies to your case. <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=309672&amp;SiteID=1" data-linktype="external">http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=309672&amp;SiteID=1</a>

Hi Xinwei,
no, I don't think the SQL-Express is offline or idle at that time, nothing in the log implies to that:

I got this message again and again, to say my sql server is full of this error... Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM'. [CLIENT: &lt;local machine&gt;]
As suggested I checked Sql Server logs which says
Error: 18456 Severity :14 &nbsp;State :16
Recently I took some of the databases offline which we were not using. But when I checked that login 'NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM' has access to two databases which were taken offline I brought those two offline databases online, I hope the error might not occur again, and as of now I did not see any error message. Still fingures crossed.
Thanks for the information.</p>

My Severity 1 fix:
I had to use SQL Server 2005 (Developer Edition) Surface Area Configuration and then "Add New Administrator" granting myself privileges on the next screen to log in (using Windows Authentication). Then I was good to go. Easy once you figure it out. I guess they were paranoid and didn't want to automatically assume that the person installing it would actually want to log in as administrator (?).</p>

Hey Guys,
what is State 4 all about?
Short information:
We recently get the Error:
18456 State 4</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SQL Server 2005 Developer 64 Bit</li>
<li>Windows Server 2008 Enterprise 64 Bit
Well intersting Thing here is, that just the Active Directory Administrator can Login to the Server. We tryed several things:
User with SQL Admin rights. -&gt; No Effect
Just the Active Directory Admin and Local Administrator can Login to the Databases.
Also interesting, the Initializer and Controls could be controlled and the Login works great. But, there is no possibility for a Local or Remote Connection to the Datebases.
Activating Romte Connection Functionality -&gt; No Effect
Ok we tryed a lot of stuff.
Then we installed the SQL Server again in Mixed Authentication Mode. Ports in the Router are opened. And the first effect anyone can now login! But no Remote connection possible.
So we found out, that the Software Firewall in Windows Server 2k8 blocked the SQL Server. So this is easy. So now everything is working correct an we can work with it.
But 2 questions still remains:
First, what is that State 4 Thing all about. And please no internal Error Comment!
Why can just the Active Directory Administrator login?
And why have be as creative as that to get a workaround?

I had this problem with state #8 (Password mismatch). I removed the "Enforce password policy" and now it's working.
My password was not wrong. If I pasted it in the login form on the server it would work, and if I pasted on my PC it would not. Until I uncheck this option.
Sorry but this is a bug! Lost hours for this...</p>

Shyam,
&nbsp;You will need to go to the server that is running SQL Server, find the server's ERRORLOG file (located at something like: %ProgramFiles%Microsoft SQL ServerMSSQL.1INSTANCENAMELogERRORLOG), and get the State from the ERRORLOG file; then come back to this blog and compare the state with the states mentioned in the blog. &nbsp;As this blog post points out, there are many potential causes for the "Login failed for user 'sa'" error message, but the state will pin down the exact root cause.
Hope this helps!

Our application was running as a network service on a remote server (2003) and login to SQL was attempted with DomainServer$.
Everything had worked fine for a long time, but on one day we ran into
"Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 11."
Finally the solution was to remove that login from SQL Server and recreate it - and everything started to work immediately.
What could be the reason for this? Has something happened in AD that had broken the login. All the time Security Event Log created success audit events for the connection but SQL Server gave the error.</p>

Hi Esa,
This coild happen if the SID of the login changed. &nbsp;When the login is added to SQL the SID of the login account it used to store the identity of the account. &nbsp;If the user is dropped and re-created in AD, then a new globally unique SID is generated. &nbsp;Hence the old SID stored in SQL's security tables is no longer valid, you need to drop and re-create the login. &nbsp;I'll double check with the security group to see if there is way to "refresh" the SID without having to drop and re-create the login.</p>

Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16.)
&nbsp;now ,I know that the meaning of state 16 is no permissions .but,i think that it's not possible about
sa. i hope you can tell me the reason.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous</strong><br>

State 16 is a little more general than no permissions: it means that login failed while trying to log in to the database specified in the connection string. &nbsp;This can happen for a variety of reasons, the most common of which is that the user specified a database that they don't have permission to.
&nbsp;Another possibility, though, is that you've specified a database that doesn't exist: for instance, maybe you misspelled the database's name. &nbsp;Another possibility would be that that database is in single-user mode.
Hope this helps,
Dan</p>

A common reason for Error is 18456, Severity: 14, State: 8. is in a development shop where the client is located in a domain and the server is not. In this case if your client is not configured to use TCP/IP you should also see corresponding errors on your Windows Server Security Audit Log - event id 529 - Unknown user name or bad password.
The solution (in SQL2005) is to configure an alias that uses TCP as the preferred protocol. To do this go to SQL2005 ...-&gt; Configuration Tools -&gt; SQL Server Configuration Manager -&gt; SQL Native Client Configuration -&gt; Alias. Lookup SQL2005 for help with setting parameters.
This should work for SQL2000 as well but the navigation path to set it up would be different.</p>

We're seeing an issue in our environment where we have a .NET 1.1 web application on a Windows 2003 server machine and SQL Server 2005 on a Windows 2000 server machine. &nbsp;In the application, we use SQL logins to connect to the db. &nbsp;What we are seeing is, when a bad password is used at login, an error message is generated (login failed, state 8) in the event log which is what's expected, but then we continually see the same error message repeating for the next few hours as if the connection is still alive and retrying automatically. &nbsp;Any ideas why? &nbsp;Thanks</p>

k and tareq,
&nbsp;Can you provide the full Login Failed error message from the SQL Server ERRORLOG? &nbsp;That will contain a state, which as this blog post indicates is the important piece of information that tells why the login is failing. &nbsp;Tareq, in your case, I think that state is from the client, since State 1 is the generic we send to the client to avoid information disclosure. &nbsp;The server ERRORLOG file will have a different state.</p>

I am building some reports using SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services, using a shared data source. The particular SQL authentication I need to use connects OK in the shared data source definition, but always fails with State: 8 when I plug the shared data source name into a report's dataset definition.
I can put the credentials "locally", as it were, into a report and that's fine. Ultimately, though, I will want to schedule the reports with Report Manager so I need to get the shared data source working.
I have tried this many many times: trust me the password IS correct! Any ideas, anybody?</p>

Also noticed the error can be caused by SQL Jobs that reference databases that have been removed or taken offline. We've disabled the job in question and the error has gone away. You will need to remove the job or resolve the conflicts within the job.</p>

I found that I had several jobs with incorrect parameters listed. Deleting these jobs eliminated the state 16 errors that were occurring every minute.
While scrolling to end of this thread to add this information, I noticed Jeremy Bond said:
"Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16.
Also noticed the error can be caused by SQL Jobs..."
Should have read ALL posts in this thread before I spent an hour tracking down bogus login.
Hope this eliminates some frustration for you.</p>

My issue is that I can't even create a link server successfully it throws the error
Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITYANONYMOUS LOGON'. [CLIENT: ??.??.??.??]
In my first post I may have hinted that the link server was created successfully but I can't do that. so for some reason it is not doing the security account delegation even though I am able to login to the server A and server B with 'KERBEROS'.
The setting on the computer object in AD has also been set to "Trust for delegation".
Any other setting that I may be missing.</p>

#2 "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" is not selected for the account I am using to run query across link server

Hello,
I'm also getting State 16 errors on a SQL user, which has permissions to access the target database. And we're also using IIS (from an other server) to connect to the SQL server.
As far as i've read correctly, this error can also occour when the database of (temporarely) offline / not available.
But we have not taken the DB offline, so SQL server has some trouble accessing the DB itself.
Is there any way to determine why the DB is offline/not accesable (logging?) other then using the USE DATABASE statement?</p>

Greg,
You probably have other application or service(e.g. SQL Agent) running to turn the database into "single user" mode. You can use SQL Server Profiler to find out who did it. Please refer to BOL

If you got state 1 log_in failed message, you need to add some SQL privileges to the account you've logged in with.
Go to &nbsp;SQLServerManagementStudio
Configuration Tools
SQL Server Surface Area Configuration
Add new Administrator
Add the two privileges on the left to your account (which you are logged in with)</p>

dear Xinwei,
the problem posted on 12-17 continues to happen with regularity. &nbsp;your information says to use 'sql profiler' to figure out who, or what process, is mysteriously changing the database status to 'single user' mode.
question 1. &nbsp;is 'sql profiler' available for sql 2005 express? &nbsp;if so, where, or how does one find, or install it?
question 2. &nbsp;if 'sql profiler' is only available with sql 2005 standard (or higher). &nbsp;how would one setup sql profiler for sql 2005 standard?
question 3. &nbsp;in speed reading books online about 'sql profiler' it seems that one must know what events or sql commands to trace. &nbsp;can you suggest how one would set the correct sql to look for that might set the database mode to single user mode? &nbsp;ive seen there is a sql command that explicitly sets the database mode to single user, but ive also read that some built-in functions such as 'dbcc' might also set the database mode to single user. &nbsp;who knows, perhaps there are many such functions... &nbsp;how would you suggest i try to configure 'sql profiler' to detect what is changing the database mode to 'single user'?
thanks alot</p>

I have also encountered a couple of new States in SQL Server 2008:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Login failed for user '&lt;username&gt;'. Reason: Failed to open the explicitly specified database. [CLIENT: &lt;IP&gt;]
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 38.
This error occurs when the database specified as the initial catalog is unavailable (for security or otherwise). This was reported as a State 16 in SQL Server 2005.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Login failed for user '&lt;username&gt;'. Reason: Failed to open the database specified in the login properties. [CLIENT: &lt;IP&gt;]
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 40.
This error occurs when the users default database is unavailable. This was reported as State 16 in SQL Server 2005.
Hope this helps someone else.</p>

After installing SP3 (KB955706) for SQL Server 2005 i got an:
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 11.
in sqlservers logfiles. Eventlog just says
Login failed for user '&lt;username&gt;'. [CLIENT: &lt;local machine&gt;]
I used Windows Authentication in the 2005 Management Studio, the connection was working just fine before SP3.
SOLUTION: Use "run as administrator" when starting Microsoft SQL Management Studio 2005.
ENVIRONMENT: Vista Business - all recommended updates for SQL Server 2005 and Vista as of 2009-02-04 installed.</p>

i am trying to take a database into a SQL Server 2008 Express Edition installation from a SQL Server 2005 Express Edition installation. &nbsp;the application that uses this database was designed for deployment with MSDE 1.0 but i have tested it to work without issue with MSDE 2000 and SQL Server 2005 Express Edition. &nbsp;unfortunately with 2008 i run into the following error:
2009-03-02 19:10:20.04 Logon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 8.
2009-03-02 19:10:20.04 Logon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Login failed for user 'usrx'. Reason: Password did not match that for the login provided. [CLIENT: x.x.x.x] (note that it displays the right IP --&gt; i just x'd it out)
i know the password by heart having had to pickup supporting this product after its acquisition from a company that made no callbacks regardless of situation for months at a time. &nbsp;i have manually, through the configuration utility, dropped the login/schema from the db and deleted it from the list of logins and then rebuilt through such without success. &nbsp;have also done the following through a query without success:
use MSDE_X exec sp_dropuser 'usrx'
go
use MSDE_X exec sp_droplogin 'usrx'
go
use MSDE_X exec sp_addlogin 'usrx', 'usrxpass', 'MSDE_X', 'english'
go
use MSDE_X exec sp_grantdbaccess 'usrx'
go
use MSDE_X exec sp_addrolemember 'db_owner', 'usrx'
go
can anyone tell me what i am missing? &nbsp;i am testing this in a VMware install of XP w/SP3 and looking at the system with SQL Server 2005 Express Edition i can't see anything different between that setup and the 2008 setup...
thanks in advance!</p>

Have no idea what to do, it happens about twice per day and a quick restart of the sharepoint server and we're up again. The SQL is on a seperate server that's always online.</p>

I have just had a case of "State 1 login failure", that was caused by the fact that when I installed the SQL server, I was using a domain controller, but this has since been demoted so I don't use a domain controller anymore. Of course the logins that were registered as valid for maintaining the SQL server, and all other access was closed. I did an uninstall/reinstall to fix this. I should have seen this before demoting my domain controller, bud didn't, so here's a lesson to learn.
This just to supply the information that this also can be a reason for the "State 1" failure.

I also encountered the Error 18456 Sev 14 State 16 on our MS Sql Server. At first i try to reset the password for my user but i have no success. But when I try again to look at the users properties having the error i found out that there is no default database assign for that user. I just assign a database and presto I can log on to my database.
My Slotuion:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Log on using sa account.</li>
<li>Expand secuirity and logins.</li>
<li>Right click on the user account with login problem problem and choose properties.</li>
<li>On properties genral tab, you will see an drop down option for default database used for the account, choose a database for the account to used and click ok or apply then ok.</li>
<li>Log off on sa account and try to log in again.
That solution works for me.</li>

I had the same problem.
I have management studio installed on my desk and was building a disk cleanup maintenance plan for my sql server and would get an error as soon as I clicked 'save'. I couldn't understand why I was getting the error. Then I whent down to the data center where our server is located and I logged in to the physical server. I then created the maintenance plan there. This time I got No error! Now that I look back, it makes sense.</p>

Thanks SSG. Your suggestion has helped me to resolve my problem:
SSG said:
For State 11 errors the Domain account (DomainWinNTlogin for example) was accessing SQL Server fine and then at some point we experienced the State 11 errors (maybe related to Mirror Failover or some other issues on the server). &nbsp;I had to drop the Account from the Local Admin group and this stopped the errors occurring and then I added the account back in to the Local Admin group and errors did not return.</p>

This is a VERY informative thread!
I'm getting the Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 8., but the situation doesn't make sense. &nbsp;The application that is failing to connect uses an ODBC connection. &nbsp;The ODBC connection succeeds in connecting to the database. &nbsp;The application returns a failure to connect, however, and we see the State: 8 error in the SQL log for that user.
One possible complication: We've moved this DB from SQL 2000 to SQL 2005 and have put the compatibility level at 90. &nbsp;The vendor has told us that the version of SQL Server is irrelevant to their code.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Bob</p>

Hi,
Im getting the error
Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 11.
Now, i've read through all this and tried all the various options suggested.
Essentially the I am using Windows Authentication. My user is in a functional group, which has access to the required sql server. Now, everyone else in my functional group can connect to the server without any issues, though I can not.
I've asked the admin guys to remove me from the functional group, and re add me to it as suggested in one of the above comments.
I've tried accessing it from a different machine, same login though, and I get the same error.
Can anyone point me in the right direction?
Thanks</p>

I was getting the dreaded Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16 as well after moving a Database from one Sql server to another. The security on the database was setup with AD groups.
The strange thing was: for users in certain AD groups everything worked fine. Others could not login anymore (even though they had all necessary permissions), and we got the State: 16 error.
Turned out to be caused by the fact that the new server was in a different AD domain from the users and groups. - the AD groups that didn't work anymore were "Domain Local" groups ... which can't be seen from another domain, even though there is a trust (which makes perfect sense, but you have to think about it ;-). - The solution is to change the AD groups to "Global" groups (if possible, only domain local groups can hold user accounts from both domains) and/or create groups in the other domain and setup security on the DB for those as well.
Just wanted to add this possible cause as it's a different angle yet from the others already mentioned here ;-)</p>

I get Severity: 14, State: 8 with a sprinkling of State: 5's against SQL2005 in a single domain. There are days where I don't get them at all but also days of plenty. I can see ONE error resulting from a mistyped password, but why do they keep going?
Looking over some recent comments, I already have NamedPipes, TCP, and Shared Memory enabled for SQL, as well as SQL Server authentication.
If "also enable and configure password sa user for node security on serve tree" means that the sa account should be enabled, ours isn't, but the errors never mention the sa account just a couple other accounts that are enabled and used.</p>

Finally figured out that it was the DSN file we use for linking Access to SQL tables. You want to use the Windows authorization flavor, so "Trusted_Connection=Yes" should be in it along with a UID pointing to a valid username, which will happen automatically when you go into Access and recreate the DSN choosing Windows authorization this time. Yes, you'll have to relink all your tables with this new file, but it's a small price to pay. Otherwise a plague of State 5's and 8's may be upon you when people do queries.</p>

I was getting error state 11 for a windows login. I looked at the sql server permissions and noticed that the Effective Permissions were missing âCONNECT SQLâ It was because the individual I was trying to add was part of a Active Directory Group that I wasnât aware of, and that AD Group had âDENY CONNECTâ The Deny took precedence over the individual loginâs right to connect. I just dropped the login that had the Deny Connect. Problem solved. I also made the Domain Admins take him out of that group since the guy changed jobs.</p>

Thank you for the helpful post, Il-Sung Lee.
I was able to determine, by looking at the SQL Server log, that the State was 8. Password mismatch.
However, I have about 5 services running that access the local SQL Server instance, and there doesn't not seem to be any information in the log about which application/service attempted to login with an incorrect password.
Is there a way, for example by using Process Monitor or somesuch tool, to know which Process ID tried to logon?</p>

I am trying to connect my client machine with sql server 2000 but the error thrown each time is
Connection :failed
SQL State : 28000
Sql Server Error : 18452
[microsoft][sql server driver][sql server][login failed for user null.
Reason : not associated with the trusted sql server connection.
This connection is functioning properly in 3 client machine but throwing error for two client machine.
I have tried to change the above process described (Security-Login-----]
and the second problem is its showing the name of server two times in the same list .. so is it conflicting with the server detection.
Your valuable feedback is highly appreciated.

Suddenly started receiving a log full of login failed messages with Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16.
This happens for any login where the default db is not explicitly stated. Explicitly stating the default db in the connection works fine, but should not be required in a correctly working server (so long as the default db is correctly set).
The users are using domain login AND access is granted by an AD group. The group has the default database attribute set, the default database is online, and the users have access to no other databases by membership in any other group.
I've also tried to rule out schemas without owners and SQL Agent jobs referencing db's that don't exist. I remain baffled.
Any ideas what I'm missing or how to troubleshoot this?
Cheers,
Eric</p>

There could be much more resions, as the original says.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Check the Server Property for the security configuration, If it is windows, bydefault SQL SA account should be disables.</li>
<li>Try to enable SA account</li>
<li>Match the password.
4)Make sure other login user the Secure (Connect to SQL Server)</li>
<li>and much more since the more error you get you have more solution to resolve that... See the BOL and other SQL forums..

Who ever is facing any problem in sql while login in sql authentication mode, just try this trick,
Step 1: Login in to windows authentication
Step 2: Run following script:
-- ***********************************
-- SQL Query to Alter the [sa] login and reEnable it
USE [tempdb]
ALTER LOGIN [sa] WITH PASSWORD=N'123', DEFAULT_DATABASE=[master], DEFAULT_LANGUAGE=[us_english], CHECK_EXPIRATION=OFF, CHECK_POLICY=OFF
GO
ALTER LOGIN [sa] ENABLE
-- ***********************************
now close your SSMS and restart it and try to login again by userID 'sa' and pwd '123'...
Enjoy...

I had an sql server pc that was running within a domain. (i wanted my app to connect to this instance)
I resolved it by creating a login for each user via the sql server &nbsp;Logins , also a user for the database with the domainnameuser &nbsp;
(I was using windows auth &nbsp;for my server and local instance false as I didnt want a local copy created for my users, the problem was that although my user could access the sql server via windows auth- but tconnecting to the database, I would still need a user and login for each person accessing my database.

Hello,
On SQL Server 2005 SP3
One time I had the same error 18456, but with no Level and State.
After a look at Windows Events it seems to be a rights trouble.
I create my domainaccount to the SQL Server logins with sysadmin role.
Then start SQL Agent like a charm !</p>

Love it!! The errors are kept non descript for security reasons to keep people from understanding why it's failing, but here are the reasons for the failures. Thank goodness hackers can't use google :) Here's an even better option, to stop the possibility of the wrong people having access, stop all authentication. Sheez MS, could you get any dumber??</p>

Excellent post. &nbsp;I was fumbling until I saw this. &nbsp; It would be good to repost and update the list of States or at least point to where to find the full list. &nbsp; I found that 58 means the user is logging in with SQL User credentials but the database server is configured to only use Windows Login credentials.</p>

I have tried resetting the password on the SQL Server 2012 and I am able to get back in just fine. However, if I switch PC's or logout of Windows 7 and back in again, and use the same credentials that just worked. The same error message comes up. We have roaming profiles enabled and we are trying to resolve why this keeps happening. Any input would be most helpful. Thanks!</p>

One to a few times during the work day, seemingly at random, I am getting a log entry of "Login failed for user '&lt;our domain&gt;mfreeman'. [CLIENT: 192.168.0.48]". This is paired with a log entry of "Error: 18456, Severity: 14, State: 16." at the same time.
I captured this with Profiler and found that it is for the master database (which is online and not having any troubles -- I can run queries against it in SSMS just fine) and is coming from an ApplicationName of ".Net SqlClient" (which could be anything).
This is my own login (which has the sysadmin role in the instance), and it is coming from my workstation. I get it
Is there any way to find out more specifically what might be attempting the access or why it might be failing?</p>

I think these step below will help you:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.</li>
<li>Login with Window Authentication user</li>
<li>Right click Database server --&gt; chose Properties</li>
<li>Click Security --&gt; Server authentication --&gt; change to "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode"</li>
<li>Click OK --&gt; restart services.
Done.
Hope helpful.</li>

Thanks for this. &nbsp;I have never had a server set to just windows authentication so I had no idea about this property. &nbsp;But here is an idea, Microsoft. &nbsp;If the server authentication is set to Windows Authentication mode then don't present SQL Server login option in the drop down when connecting to the server. &nbsp; I'm using SQL Server 2012 and this behavior is the same as it was in v 2005.</p>
