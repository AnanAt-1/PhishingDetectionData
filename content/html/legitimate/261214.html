            ODP - Open Directory Project (dmoz.org)</font></font></b></h1>
   <b><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">July 2001 - Revised&nbsp;February 
            2004</font></font></b>  
                        
            <p>The Open Directory Project (ODP) at <font face="Verdana"><font size="-1"><b><a href="http://dmoz.org/" target="_BLANK">dmoz.org</a></b> 
            is not the sexiest looking portal to the web by a long shot. Many 
            people never visit the main ODP site directly either, but virtually 
            everybody who uses Google or many other major portal and search 
            services use Open Directory data.</font></font> </p>
                           
            <p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">Why is the Open Directory 
            so important? When I first wrote about using the ODP for web site 
            promotion, it was one of the top three big directories, the others 
            being <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo!</a> 
            and <a href="http://www.looksmart.com/">LookSmart</a>. In the part 
            three-and-a-half years though the Yahoo! directory has faded and 
            LookSmart is struggling financially and is loosing traffic all the 
            time. This leaves the Open Directory as being by far the biggest 
            and most important directory, with four million entries and thousands 
            of volunteer editors.</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana"><font size="-1">There are many thousands 
            of downstream users of ODP data, but by far the most important is 
            Google, the search engine that now accounts for around 80% of all 
            search engine traffic. The ODP's relationship with Google is a very 
            important one for both organisations, and the bottom line for webmasters 
            is this - while it's possible to get great results in Google </font></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>without</i> 
            being listed in the Open Directory, it's certainly helps <i>a lot</i> 
            to be listed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, it's a directory too, 
            and the way the ODP organises data makes it an easy and powerful 
            tool to look up a range of sites on a particular topic. This directory 
            is also used by <a href="http://directory.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank">Alexa</a>, <a href="http://search.aol.com/" target="_blank">AOL</a> 
            and <a href="http://search.netscape.com/" target="_blank">Netscape</a>, 
            plus <a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/Open_Directory_Project/Sites_Using_ODP_Data/" target="_blank">many 
            others</a>, so that probably the majority of people using the ODP 
            data don't every actually visit the dmoz.org site. The combination 
            of a huge directory, with half a million categories, and the influence 
            it has on results in major search engines, is one of the reasons 
            that the ODP is a hugely important resource. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, how much does it cost to get 
            listed in this important directory? Nothing. The ODP is almost entirely 
            run by unpaid volunteers, so a listing is free - if your site is 
            eligible - but unfortunately this can some times take a little while.</font></p>
            <p>There is no guaranteed way to get a listing in the ODP, but the 
            following tips should make life a lot easier. </p>
                           
            <h2>Step One - Housekeeping and Content</h2>
            <p>Keep your site polished and up-to-date. Make sure that you have 
            some recent content on the front page and all the copyright notices 
            are current. Check that your links are working properly. Check your 
            spelling. If you've stuffed the pages full of advertising banners 
            that don't generate any revenue, then get rid of them. Imagine that 
            you were inviting a potential buyer to come and see your house - 
            you'll want to clean the carpets, put a new lick of paint down and 
            get some fresh coffee brewing. </p>
            <p>Never submit a site &quot;under construction&quot; and assume 
            that by the time the editor looks at it, then it will be finished. 
            Often the site will be reviewed and rejected very quickly. Also, 
                        don't submit a &quot;vanity URL&quot; that redirects 
                        to another site (e.g. on Geocities) as this will usually 
                        be removed and can delay your listing. If you have a 
                        domain name, then host the site properly.</p>
            <p>The site will be rejected if it is a copy or substantially mirrors 
            the content of another site, acts as a doorway to another site, 
            is not content rich or is primarily aimed at driving traffic to 
            affiliate links. Keep the content unique to your site and provide 
                        plenty of it.</p>
            <h2>Step Two - Finding a Home</h2>
            <p>Take some time finding the correct category for your site. There 
            are hundreds of thousands of places to try to list your site, but 
            it's very important that you choose the correct one. The ODP tends 
            to split commercial sites from information ones, so for example, 
            a site <i>selling</i> collectable widgets would be listed in a quite 
            different category to a site with information about <i>collecting</i> 
            widgets. Usually there is a link in each category to help you find 
            the right one.</p>
            <p>Identifying the correct category for your site is probably the 
            single most important thing you can do. If you have a site that 
            is a competitor, or is closely related to the content of your own 
            site, then find where they are listed in the ODP. Broadly speaking, 
            the following top-level categories carry the following types of 
            sites:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Adult</b> - this part of the directory is not visible 
                from the main dmoz.org page but can be found at <a href="http://dmoz.org/Adult/">http://dmoz.org/Adult/</a> 
                - this covers sites that are sexually explicit in nature or 
                carry other adult-themed topics.</li>
                <li><b>Arts</b> - primarily&nbsp;information sites, nonprofit 
                organisations, individual publications, TV shows, films or other 
                events. Generally not for shopping or business sites.</li>
                <li><b>Business - </b>Business-to-business sites, financial 
                institutions, real estate, manufacturing, and other non-shopping 
                commercial sites.</li>
                <li><b>Computers - </b>Almost anything to do with computers, 
                including hardware, software, and the internet. A mix of reference 
                sites and commercial organisations, although not general retailers 
                of consumer electronics who are listed in Shopping. Weblogs 
                are listed here.</li>
                <li><b>Games - </b>primarily reference and noncommercial sites 
                relating to all sorts of games, electronic or otherwise.</li>
                <li><b>Health - </b>a mix of reference and commercial sites 
                covering a broad variety of topics.</li>
                <li><b>Home - </b>strictly noncommercial and reference sites.</li>
                <li><b>Kids and Teens -</b> an area of the directory with sites 
                safe for children to visit.</li>
                <li><b>News - </b>all sorts of news sources and publications.</li>
                <li><b>Recreation</b> - almost all noncommercial sites covering 
                everything except sport.</li>
                <li><b>Reference </b>- another noncommercial category with material 
                such as maps, dictionaries etc.</li>
                <li><b>Regional - </b>an important category broken down into 
                regions and countries. The main area of the directory is for 
                sites that are either of global interest or for US categories. 
                Sites that deal specifically with, say, UK shopping, should 
                be listed under Regional. This category continues all the way 
                down to individual towns and communities.</li>
                <li><b>Science - </b>mostly reference materials covering a broad 
                range of themes.</li>
                <li><b>Shopping - </b>for all consumer-orientated retail outlets 
                where purchases can be made somehow through the web site. Usually 
                this is through an online shopping basket, but as long as products 
                are listed and there is some way to purchase them, then sites 
                may be eligible for a listing. Sites listed here either serve 
                a global/international market, or a US/North American&nbsp;one. 
                Sites that don't allow some sort of online purchase should be 
                submitted to a Regional category. Affiliate sites are never 
                acceptable into this part of the directory.</li>
                <li><b>Society - </b>including religion, politics, law, relationships 
                and sexuality. Personal Homepage are listed here.</li>
                <li><b>Sports - </b>everything sports related except shopping.</li>
                <li><b>World</b> - The main part of the Open Directory is for 
                English language sites only. For non-English languages, sites 
                should be submitted in the World categories which mirror the 
                main part of the directory.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour looking through 
            the directory, and also be aware that you can only be listed once 
            (if you have a bricks-and-mortar shop, factory or office then you 
            can also apply to be listed in your hometown). Excessive multiple 
            submissions may result in your site being permanently banned.</p>
            <p>Why is choosing the correct category so important? Simply put, 
            it might delay your acceptance into the directory by months or even 
            years if you mis-submit. A badly misplaced site may be passed between 
            several categories with different editors before it finds a home.</p>
            <h2>Step Three - Write a Good Description</h2>
            <p>The vast majority of submitters simply do not understand how 
            to describe their site, and are usually disappointed when it comes 
            out differently from the way they expected. ODP descriptions are 
            purely descriptive of the site and are not promotional in any way. 
            You need to write one or two sentences describing the important 
            parts of your site or business. Look at the other sites listed in 
            the category you are applying to, and you should get an idea of 
            what is acceptable.&nbsp;Spend some time on this.. for a business 
            site you might want to consider consulting with others on how you 
            wish to describe your business. </p>
            <p>There is no guarantee that your description will be accepted 
            by the editor, but it <i>is</i> much more likely if the site fits 
            in with the ODP guidelines for <a href="http://dmoz.org/guidelines/describing.html#descriptions" target="_blank">describing 
            a site</a>. Changing the description of a site after it has been 
            added is possible, but any attempt at &quot;hyping&quot; your site 
            will be rejected.</p>
            <p>If you don't write a good description for your site, then the 
            editor will have to write one for you, however it is unlikely that 
            the editor will spend much time on this, so it might not be as fully 
            descriptive as you might like.</p>
            <h2>Step Four - Submit and Wait</h2>
            <p>Once you have submitted the site without any timeouts or error 
            messages coming up, then your site is in the queue for that particular 
            category. Most sites are reviewed in date order of submission, and 
            resubmitting your site will typically move it down the queue. Despite 
            the ODP's guidelines suggesting you should re-submit the site after 
                        a month or so, in reality this <i>may</i> just move 
                        you further down the queue.</p>
                        <p>If you are not listed in a month or two and you feel 
                        that your site might not be in the queue or may have 
                        been rejected, then you can ask&nbsp;about the status 
                        of your site at the <a href="http://www.resource-zone.com/" target="_blank">ODP 
                        Public Forum</a> - make sure you read the guidelines 
                        properly, though. This should give you some feedback 
                        about the status of your submission. Editors will often 
                        not respond to site status requests if you make them 
                        directly.</p>
                        <p>It can take anything from ten minutes to a couple 
                        of years to get your site listed. Usually, it will happen 
                        within a few weeks. Some parts of the directory are 
                        badly backlogged and it can take many months for your 
                        site to be reviewed. There is really very little you 
                        can do about the waiting time, but if you have found 
                        the correct category and written a good description 
                        then at least you site will be dealt with promptly when 
                        the editor reviews it.</p>
