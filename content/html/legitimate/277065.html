Open Firmware, the first non-proprietary <a href="bootfw.htm">boot
firmware</a> that is usable on different processors and buses, is
required by the <a href="prp.htm">PR*P</a> and <a
href="chrp.htm">CHRP</a> specifications, and is defined by <a
href="ieee.htm">IEEE standard 1275-1994</a>.

The list of Open Firmware features is long and comprehensive.  We have
both a <a href="features.htm">high-level functional breakdown</a> of
these Open Firmware features, as well as a <a
href="featlist.htm">lengthy feature listing</a> including all of those
features required by IEEE Standard 1275-1994 as well as FirmWorks's
extensions.
