      Having mulled over this for much too long, I say, let's do it. Just put it on the 
      sites you find OK. As stated below, no support is available, and, as I'm sad to say, 
      not even the manual text is available - it was done using WordStar, MagicBind and 
      a Visual-100 terminal with programmable function keys, using command macros for most 
      of the formatting. It was easy to create at that time...

The Modula-2 System for Z80 CP/M was distributed on three 8-inch diskettes in standard
CP/M format. Files on each of these three diskettes were consolidated into one with 
a version of ZIP utilities that allows extraction with the "UNZIP.COM" program available 
on the Walnut Creek CP/M CDROM (and other places). This way, you can extract them on 
native CP/M 2.2 and compatible systems.

<H2>PARASOL by Shay Walters</H2>
<P><A HREF="develop/parasol.zip">PARASOL, a public domain compiler for CP/M</A>, 155K.

<P>
This is what the author writes about it:
<blockquote>
<PRE>
<FONT FACE="courier" SIZE="2">
     PARASOL is a language I developed myself for my own business 
use.   It  has been tailored to provide the features I needed for 
the  applications I have developed over the last  several  years.  
Due  to the overwhelming popularity of the MS-DOS systems running 
on the 8086, I feel that there is no longer any need to keep this 
to myself.   Therefore,  I am placing this into the public domain 
so that others may benefit from it.
     PARASOL  is not modeled after any one  particular  language, 
but has features derived from COBOL, ALGOL, and PASCAL (and maybe 
just a touch of BASIC).  The individual statements are COBOL-like 
while the structure of the language more closely follows ALGOL.
     The language provides many high-level constructs, especially 
in the area of file record I/O, yet it maintains the closeness to 
the  machine  hardware which is so necessary in  those  difficult 
situations.

<H2>Z80 ASM by Joe Moore</H2>

<P>A WINDOWS(TM) 32bit GUI program.
<BR><BR>
A hack but very capable. Assembles almost all DR ASM/MAC code with little
or NO modifications. Reads Intel mnemonics with z80 extensions (or can
use DR zlib.mac). Produces sRec, iHex, or binary. Generates listing.
Extensions to assemble for the floating point co-processor in the ZEMU
emulator. Additions of many directives from several other assemblers
makes writing code easy.  Package includes AS8080 (a z80 assembler), a
z80 dissassembler with ability to define data areas not to be encoded as
instructions. Output can be assembled with AS8080 (or if i8080 only, with
 DR ASM/MAC). Package also includes a program to assemble binaries into a
bootable disk image. Designed for hobbiest use.

The files comprising the complete distribution disk are available here as one .ZIP
file. Extracting this file under MSDOS or Linux creates a subdirectory (HAWLEY1) containing
four more subdirectories with files to go in four User Areas (USER0..USER3) on the CP/M
diskette. A 'README' file in each user area explains the contents and necessary instructions.

Processor Technologies <B>SCS-1</B> (pre-dates ALS-8).  PT put it in the public
domain and IMSAI and others sold paper-tape &amp; cassette copies with a manual
that had the entire source code listed.

"find" program, a linker and a cross-referencer. Also available are
the libraries for calling CP/M, doing I/O and the language runtime.<BR>
Draco sources for all tools are included.
