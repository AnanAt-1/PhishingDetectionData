<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>
Tcl was originally designed for using in single-threaded programs.
But recently, there has been an increasing need to use the power
of Tcl in applications that contain multiple threads of control.
Unfortunately, stock Tcl will not function properly in a multi-threaded
application if it is used simultaneously by more than one thread.
</p>

<p>
There have been prior attempts to address this issue.
<a href=http://www.activesw.com/people/steve>Steve Jankowski</a>
created a modified version of the Tcl sources called
<a href=http://www.activesw.com/people/steve/mttcl.html>MTtcl</a>
which allows the use of Tcl in a multi-threaded environment.
But Jankowski's implementation has limitations of its own:
<ul>
<li> It only works under Solaris threads, not POSIX threads.
<li> Tt only works for Tcl versions 7.4 and earlier.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This article describes a new implementation of multi-threaded Tcl
that is based on POSIX threads and works with Tcl version 7.6.
We are currently calling the new implementation ``Pthreads-Tcl''
or ``PtTcl'' for short.
(Suggestions for better names are welcomed.)
PtTcl borrows some of Jankowski's ideas, but is a completely new
implementation.
The latest sources to PtTcl can be obtained from

<h2>2 Threading Model</h2>

<p>
PtTcl allows an application to have multiple Tcl interpreters running
in independent threads.
Each thread in a PtTcl program can contain any number of interpreters
(including zero).
But PtTcl only allows an interpreter to be run from a single thread.
If another thread tries to use an interpreter, an error message is
returned.
</p>

<p>
In regular Tcl, there is a single event queue used to process all
timer and file events.
In PtTcl, this concept is extended to one event queue per thread.
That is to say, every thread has its own independent event queue.
The fact that each thread has its own event queue is a necessary
consequence of the restriction that Tcl interpreters must always
be run in the same thread.
Recall that the usual action taken when an event arrives is for
a Tcl script to run in some interpreter.
But if the event arrives to the event queue in thread A,
there would be no way for the event queue to execute a Tcl script
on some other thread B.
Hence, each thread must have its own event queue in order to be able
to invoke Tcl scripts in response to events.
</p>

<p>
Each thread has the concept of a <em>main interpreter</em>.
The main interpreter is different from other interpreters
in the same thread in only one way: you
can send messages to main interpreter.
Other than that, all interpreters are the same.
</p>

<p>
Messages sent to other threads are a kind of event, so a Tcl interpreter
running in a given thread will not process any messages until it
visits its event loop.
A Tcl interpreter
visits its event loop whenever it executes one of the commands
<kbd>vwait</kbd> or <kbd>update</kbd>.
Tcl might also visit the event loop in response to two commands that
are new to PtTcl: <kbd>thread eventloop</kbd> 
and <kbd>thread send</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
Messages can be either synchronous (meaning they will wait for a
response) or asynchronous (fire and forget).  
The result returned to the sending thread from a synchronous message
is the result of the Tcl script in the receiving thread or
possibly an error message if the message couldn't be sent for some
reason.
An asynchronous message has no result unless there is an error.
Asynchronous messages can be broadcast to all main interpreters,
or to all main interpreters except the interpreter that is doing
the sending.
</p>

<p>
A message can be sent from any interpreter, not just the main interpreter,
or directly from C code.
There does not have to be a Tcl interpreter running in a thread in
order for that thread to send a message, but a main interpreter
is necessary in order for the message to be received.
</p>

<p>
Most variables used by a Tcl interpreter are private to that interpreter.
But PtTcl implements a mechanism for sharing selected variables between
two or more interpreters, even interpreters running in different threads.
This mechanism provides a kind of crude shared memory between threads.
However, it is not currently possible to put trace events on shared
variables, and this limits their usefulness.
</p>

<p>
Here is a quick summary of the execution model used by PtTcl:
<ul>
<li>A single thread can contain any number of Tcl interpreters.
<li>A particular Tcl interpreter may only be used from within a single
    thread.
<li>Each thread has its own event queue.
<li>A message (in the form of a Tcl script) can be sent to the
    main Tcl interpreter in any thread.
<li>Tcl variables may be shared between two or more Tcl interpreters,
    even interpreters running in separate threads.
</ul>

<h2>3 Building Pthreads-Tcl</h2>

<p>
To build PtTcl, first obtain and unpack the source tree, then
<kbd>cd</kbd> into the directory <filename>pttcl7.6a2/unix</filename> and
enter one of the commands
<pre>
   ./configure --enable-pthreads
</pre>
or
<pre>
   ./configure --enable-mit-pthreads
</pre>
Use the first form at installations where POSIX threads programs can
be built simply by linking in the special <kbd>-lpthreads</kbd> library.
The second form is for installations that use MIT pthreads and require
the special <kbd>pgcc</kbd> C compiler.
</p>

<p>
After configurating the distribution, type
<pre>
   make
</pre>
to build a <kbd>tclsh</kbd> executable, as you normally would.
Note that if you omit the 
<kbd>--enable-pthreads</kbd> or <kbd>--enable-mit-pthreads</kbd>
option from the <kbd>./configure</kbd> command, 
then the <kbd>tclsh</kbd> you build will not
contain support for pthreads.
</p>

<h2>4 New Tcl Commands</h2>

<p>
The PtTcl package implements two new Tcl commands.
The ``<kbd>shared</kbd>'' command is used to designate
variables that are to be shared with other interpreters, and
the ``<kbd>thread</kbd>'' command is used to create
and control threads.
</p>

<a name=H0006>
<h3>4.1 The ``<kbd>shared</kbd>'' command</h3>

<p>
The <kbd>shared</kbd> is uncomplicated.
It works very much like the standard <kbd>global</kbd>
command.
<kbd>Shared</kbd> takes one or more arguments which are names of
variables that are to be shared by all Tcl interpreters, including
interpreters in other threads.
Note that both interpreters must execute the <kbd>shared</kbd>
command independently before they will really be using the same
variable.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the <kbd>trace</kbd> command will not work on shared
variables.
This is another consequence of the fact that a given interpreter can
only be used in a single thread.
When a trace is set on a variable, a Tcl script is run whenever that
variable is read, written or deleted.
But if the trace was set by thread A and the variable is changed by
thread B, there is no way for thread B to invoke the trace script
in thread A.
</p>

<p>
In order to do much of anything with shared variables, there needs to
be some way to lock a variable so that two threads to try to change it
at the same time.
This is not hard to implement from a technical standpoint, but it is
tricky to get the design right.
We're still working on the design.
</p>

<a name=H0007>
<h3>4.2 The ``<kbd>thread</kbd>'' command</h3>


<p>
The <kbd>thread</kbd> command is much more complex than <kbd>shared</kbd>.
<kbd>Thread</kbd> contains nine separate subcommands used to
create new threads, send and receive messages, query the thread
database, and so forth.
Each is described separately below.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread self</code>
</blockquote></p>

<p>
Every thread in PtTcl that contains an interpreter is assigned a
unique positive integer Id.
This Id is used by other thread commands
to designate a message recipient or the target of a join.
The <kbd>thread self</kbd> command returns the Id of the thread
that executes the command.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread create</code> [<i>command</i>]
[<code>-detach</code> <i>boolean</i>]
</blockquote></p>

<p>
New threads can be created using the <kbd>thread create</kbd> command.
The optional argument to this command is a Tcl script that is executed 
by the new thread.
After the specified script is completed, the new thread exits.
If no script is specified, the command 
``<kbd>thread eventloop</kbd>''
is used instead.
</p>

<p>
After a thread finishes executing its Tcl script, it normally waits
for another thread to join with it and takes its return value.
(See the <kbd>thread join</kbd> command below.)
But if the <kbd>-detach</kbd> option evaluates to true, then the
thread will terminate immediately upon finishing its script.
A detached thread can never be joined.
</p>

<p>
Assuming the new thread is created successfully, the 
<kbd>thread create</kbd> command return the thread Id of the 
new thread.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread send </code> <i>whom</i><code>  </code><i>message</i>
[<code>-async</code> <i>boolean</i>]
</blockquote></p>

<p>
Use the <kbd>thread send</kbd> command to send a message from one
thread to another.
The arguments to this command specify the target thread and the
message to be sent.
The message is really just a Tcl script that is executed on the
remove thread.
The <kbd>thread send</kbd> command normally waits for the message
to complete on the remote thread, then returns the result of the
script.
But if the <kbd>-async</kbd> option is true, the <kbd>thread send</kbd>
will return immediately, not waiting on a reply.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread broadcast </code><i>message</i> 
[<code>-sendtoself</code> <i>boolean</i>]
</blockquote></p>

<p>
The <kbd>thread broadcast</kbd> works like <kbd>thread send</kbd> except
that it sends the message to all threads and it always operates
asynchronously.
It won't normally send the message to itself, unless you also specify
the <kbd>-sendtoself</kbd> flag.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread update</code>
</blockquote></p>

<p>
This command causes the current thread to process all pending messages,
that is, messages that other threads have sent and are waiting for this
thread to process.
Only thread messages are processed by this command -- other kinds of
pending events are ignored.
If you want to process all pending events including thread messages,
use the <kbd>update</kbd> command from regular Tcl.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread eventloop</code>
</blockquote></p>

<p>
This command causes the current thread to go into an infinite loop
processing events, including incoming messages.
This command will not return until the interpreter is destroyed by
either an <kbd>exit</kbd> command or a <kbd>interp destroy {}</kbd>
command.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread join </code> [<code>-id </code><i>Id</i>]
[<code>-timeout </code><i>milliseconds</i>]
</blockquote></p>

<p>
The <kbd>thread join</kbd> command causes the current thread to join
with another thread that has completed processing.
The return value of this command is the result of the last command
executed by the thread that was joined.
</p>

<p>
By default, the first available thread is joined.  But you can wait
on a particular thread by using the <kbd>-id</kbd> option.
</p>

<p>
The calling thread will wait indefinitely for another thread to join,
unless you specify a timeout value.
When a timeout is specified, the <kbd>thread join</kbd> will return
after that timeout regardless of whether or not it has found another
thread to join.
A timeout of zero (0) can be used if you just want to do a quick check
to see if there are any threads already waiting to be joined, and don't
want to block.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread list</code>
</blockquote></p>

<p>
This command returns a list of Tcl thread Id numbers for each existing
thread.
</p>

<p><blockquote>
<code>thread yield</code>
</blockquote></p>

<p>
Finally, the <kbd>thread yield</kbd> command causes the current thread
to yield its timeslice to some other thread that is ready to run, if
any.

<h2>5 New C Functions</h2>

<p>
In addition to the new Tcl commands, PtTcl also provides several new
C functions that can be used by C or C++ programs to create and control
Tcl interpreters in a multi-threaded environment.
</p>

<pre>
   int Tcl_ThreadCreate(
         char *cmdText,
         void (*initProc)(Tcl_Interp*,void*),
         void *argPtr
   );
</pre>

<p>
The <code>Tcl_ThreadCreate()</code> function creates a new thread and
starts a Tcl interpreter running in that thread.
The first argument is the text of a Tcl script that the Tcl interpreter
running in the new thread will execute.
You can specify <code>NULL</code> for this first argument and the
Tcl interpreter will execute the command <kbd>thread eventloop</kbd>.
The second argument to <code>Tcl_ThreadCreate()</code> is a pointer
to a function that can be used to initialize the new Tcl interpreter
before it tries to execute its script.
The third argument is the second parameter to this initialization function.
Either or both of these arguments can be <code>NULL</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Tcl_ThreadCreate()</code> returns an integer which is the Tcl
thread Id of the new thread it creates.
This is exactly the same integer that would have been returned if the
thread had been created using the <kbd>thread create</kbd> Tcl command.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <code>Tcl_ThreadCreate()</code> may be called from a thread
that does not itself have a Tcl interpreter.
This function allows threads that don't use Tcl to create subthreads
that do.
</p>

<p>
All threads created by <code>Tcl_ThreadCreate()</code> are detached.
</p>

<p>
Note that the <code>(*initProc)()</code> function might not have executed
in the new thread by the time <code>Tcl_ThreadCreate()</code> returns, 
so the calling function should not delete the <code>argPtr</code> right
away.
It is safer to let the <code>(*initProc)()</code> take responsibility for
cleaning up <code>argPtr</code>.
</p>

<pre>
   int Tcl_ThreadSend(
         int toWhom,
         char **replyPtr,
         char *format,
         ...
   );
</pre>

<p>
The <code>Tcl_ThreadSend()</code> function allows C or C++ code to send
a message to another thread.
The first argument is the Tcl thread Id number (not the pthread_t identifier)
of the destination thread.
You can specify a destination of zero (0) in order to broadcast a message.
</p>

<p>
The second parameter is a pointer to a pointer to a string.
The message response will be written into memory obtained from the
Tcl function <code>ckalloc()</code> and <code>**replyPtr</code> will be
made to point to this memory.
If the value of the second parameter is <code>NULL</code>, then the
message is sent asynchronously.
If the first parameter is 0, then the second parameter must be 
<code>NULL</code> or else an error will be returned and no messages
will be sent.
</p>

<p>
The third parameter is a format string, in the style of <code>printf()</code>
that specifies the message that is to be sent.
Subsequent arguments are added as needed, exactly as with <code>printf()</code>.
</p>

<p>
The return value from <code>Tcl_ThreadSend()</code> is the return value of
the call to <code>Tcl_Eval()</code> in the destination thread, if this is
a synchronous message, or <code>TCL_OK</code> if this is an asynchronous
message.
But <code>TCL_ERROR</code> might be returned if an error is encountered,
such as a destination Id number of a thread that doesn't exist.
</p>

<pre>
   Tcl_Interp *Tcl_GetThreadInterp(
         Tcl_Interp *interp
   );
</pre>

<p>
One final function that might be useful is <code>Tcl_GetThreadInterp()</code>.
This routine will return a pointer to the main interpreter for the
calling thread.
If the calling thread doesn't have a main interpreter, then the interpreter
specified as its argument is made the main interpreter.
If the argument is <code>NULL</code>, then <code>Tcl_CreateInterp()</code>
is called to create a new Tcl interpreter which then becomes the
main interpreter.
At the conclusion of this function, the calling thread is guaranteed to 
have a main interpreter and a pointer to that interpreter will be
returned.

<h2>6 Status Of PtTcl Development</h2>

<p>
PtTcl is still under development.
The system contains known bugs, and existing features are subject
to alteration and/or removal.
You should therefore use it with caution.
If you encounter bugs, or have improvement suggestions, please
send them to 
<a href=mailto:drh@acm.org>Richard Hipp</a>
or <a href=mailto:mcruse@cti-ltd.com>Mike Cruse</a>.
All comments are welcomed.
</p>

<p>
So far, PtTcl has been compiled and tested only under the 
<a href=http://www.li.org>
Linux Operating System</a>
version 2.0.0 and higher.
For the pthreads library,
we've used both 
<a href=http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/proven.html>
Chris Provenzano's</a>
user-level implementation (also known as
<a href=http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/pthreads.html>
MIT Pthreads</a>)
and a kernel-level pthreads implementation by
<a href=http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy>
Xavier Leroy</a>
built on the <code>clone()</code> system call of Linux.
Neither of these pthreads implementations is without flaw.
Under MIT Pthreads, the <kbd>exec</kbd> Tcl command does not
work reliably.
The <kbd>exec</kbd> command works fine using Linux kernel
pthreads, but under heavy load, the kernel's process table
has been known to become corrupted, resulting in system crash.
Both problems are being addressed.
</p>

<p>
There also remain many features missing from PtTcl.
We've already mentioned that some kind of Tcl-level thread
synchronization and locking is needed.  This shouldn't be hard
to implement -- it is mostly a question of trying to chose the
best interface.
Also, it may be that some of the library functions called
by the Tcl <kbd>socket</kbd> command (ex: <code>gethostbyname()</code>)
are not thread-safe and need better locking.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, some small amount of work is yet to be done in
order to get PtTcl to work with Tk.

<h2>7 PtTcl For Windows And Mac</h2>

<p>
While PtTcl has so far only been tested under Unix, but
there is nothing in the implementation of PtTcl that would preclude
its use under Windows or MacIntosh.
All you need is a library for the target platform that implements
basic pthreads functionality.
We am not aware of any such library, but suspect that they do exist.
If not, it really would not be much trouble to implement as a wrapper
around the native Windows or MacIntosh thread capability.
PtTcl only uses a few of the more basic pthreads routines, so most
of the pthreads library could remain unimplemented.
</p>

<p>
If anyone undertakes to port PtTcl to Windows or Mac, we would appreciate
hearing from you.
