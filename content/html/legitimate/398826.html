<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Anna Leonowens is world famous
as the governess in the court of Siam due to the popularity of the musical
The King and I. Many people believed that they were watching a true story.
Not only regarding the antics of the king but also the importance of Anna
in the court. The film, starring Yul Brynner, so insulted the Thai people,
that it was banned from being shown in Thailand on grounds of historical
and cultural distortions. Now, a remake of the movie is being planned. Can
Hollywood make amends for past misdeeds or will history repeat itself?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">It proved easy for historians
to demolish Anna as a trustworthy historian because both her books are filled
with glaring errors. Even the title of the most famous is inaccurate for,
as King Mongkut's correspondence makes clear, she was hired not as a governess,
which implies a broad range of duties, but merely as a teacher of English.
In the text she makes elementary blunders regarding Thailand's past, offers
an explanation of buddhism that is either hopelessly confused or shamelessly
lifted from other writers, and identifies a picture of Prince Chulalongkorn
(her most prominent student) as that being of a princess. Though she claims
to have spoken fluent Thai, most of her the examples she offers are incomprehensible
even with all possible allowances made for clumsy transliterations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Her worst errors occur in The
Romance of the Harem, when, one historian suggests, &quot;her store of pertinent
facts were running low.&quot; In this she claims that the king threw wives
who displeased him into underground dungeons below the Grand Palace and,
most horrific, that he ordered the public tourture and burning of the consort
and a monk with whom she had fallen in love, a spectacle Anna claims to
have witnessed with her own eyes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">But there were no underground
dungeons at the Grand Palace or anywhere else in Bangkok, and there could
not have been in that watery soil. Nor was there any public burning, or,
if there was, it escaped the attention of every other foreign resident,
many of whom also wrote accounts of the same period. Anna simply invented
such tales, perhaps to add some spice to what would otherwise have been
a rather tepid work, just as she also exaggerated her own influence.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2" FACE="Comic Sans MS"><FONT SIZE=+2>The Truth About
Anna</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Anna claimed she was born in Wales
in 1834, which would have made her 28 when she arrived in Bangkok in 1862.
Though not wealthy, her family was distinguished; her father was an army
captain and her mother came from an ancient Welsh family. When Anna was
six, she and a sister were left behind while her parents were posted to
India where, shortly afterwards, her father was killed in battle on the
no<IMG SRC="anna.jpeg" WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="226" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">rthwest frontier.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Anna said she completed her education
in Wales and at the age of 14 or 15 sailed for India. There an unpleasant
surprise awaited in the form of a new stepfather to whom she took an intense
dislike. One reason was he wanted to marry her off to a wealthy merchant
twice her age, while she in turn had fallen in love with a dashing young
army officer named Thomas Leonowens. To escape the situation she went on
a long tour of the Middle East with a well-known scholar, the Reverend Percy
Badger, and his wife, presumably friends of the family. According to the
distinguished traveller Dame Freya Stark, who wrote an introduction to a
1952 edition of The Romance of the Harem, she returned from the trip &quot;with
a character already strongly formed, both for tolerance and independence.&quot;
She was independent enough to defy her stepfather and elope at the age of
17 with her young officer. They were blissfully happy, despite the death
of their first two children in infancy; two more, a boy and a girl, were
born and survived in London, where the couple lived for three years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">In 1857, Leonowens, by then a
major, was posted to Singapore and it was there Anna heard the bad news
that a small fortune left to her by her father had been lost in the collapse
of a bank during the Indian Mutiny. Worse was to come. A year late Major
Leonowens suffered a stroke on a tiger hunt and died, leaving her with two
small children and no money. She started a small school, bringing in enough
to send her daughter Avis back to England but not much more. A new challenge
came with an invitation from King Mongkut to go to Siam. With characteristic
pluck off she went, accompanied by her young son, Louis. A refined gentlewoman,
marked by personal loss but brave and determined to bring light to less
fortunate lives - that is the image of Anna drawn by herself, by all the
actresses who have portrayed her on stage and screen and even by historians
who accuse her of wilfully maligning a great man.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">The first person to question the
image, almost accidentally, was Dr W.S. Bristowe, an academic whose specialty
was spiders but who also wrote on other subjects. Dr Bristowe was a frequent
visitor to Thailand and in the early 1970s he decided to writer a biography
of Louis T. Leonowens, founder of the company that still bears his name.
Not many people read the book that resulted, entitled - perhaps inevitably
- Louis and the King of Siam, which is unfortunate, for Dr Bristowe's deft
detective work on Anna's past revealed an extraordinary story.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">It began in London with a routine
check to ascertain the exact date of Louis' birth. He found nothing, either
for Louis or for Avis. Nor, when he looked further, could he find anyone
named Thomas Leonowens who had served in the army, in either India or England.
Nor did the army know anything about the man Anna claimed to be her father.
Strangest of all, Welsh archives failed to yield any mention of Anna herself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Dr Bristowe now set about tracking
down the elusive Anna with all the enthusiasm he normally gave to a rare
species of spider. Here is what a diligent search of Indian office records
eventually revealed. Anna was born, not in Wales but in India, not in 1834
but in 1831. Her father was Thomas Edwards, a cabinet-maker from Middlesex
who enlisted in the Bombay infantry and went to the subcontinent in 1825.
There he married Mary Anne Glassock, the daughter of a gunner in the Bengal
Artillery and a local mother who, in all likelihood, was Eurasian.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">The couple had two daughters,
Eliza and Anna, and Thomas died three months before the birth of the latter,
leaving his wife penniless. When Anna was two months old, her mother remarried,
this time to a corporal who not long afterwards was demoted to private.
Here the record blurred, but somehow - possibly through the assistance of
a charity - Anna and Eliza were sent to her father's relations in England,
where they presumably received an education.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">They <IMG SRC="leon2.gif" WIDTH=
"230" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Anna Leonowens">returned
to India in their early teens and entered a home which Dr Bristowe claims
&quot;must have appalled them,&quot; for the life of a private soldier at
the time was a squalid one of &quot;drunkeness and fornication.&quot; Eliza
was married off at 15 to a 38-year-old sergeant and something similar was
clearly planned for Anna. Instead, at 14 she went off to the Middle East
with the Reverend Badger. How she met the clergyman (later to become a noted
oriental scholar) is uncertain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">Anna married when she was 18,
not to a dashing young officer but to a 22-year-old clerk whose name was
not Leonowens but Thomas Leon Owens. He did not seem to hold any job for
long and the couple moved about frequently. Dr Bristowe never did pinpoint
the precise birth dates of Louis and Avis and finally concluded they must
have taken place on board a ship. At some other unknown time Leon Owens
changed his name to Leonowens, and the doctor did find a record of his death
- of apoplexy - in Penang, on May 8, 1859, where he was listed as a &quot;hotel
keeper.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">According to Dr Bristowe, Anna
was already busily burying her past when she arrived in Singapore, so successfully
not even her own children penetrated her disguise. Among other things, this
required a complete break with her sister Eliza back in India, a step she
may have been doubly glad she took - given the social prejudices of the
time - if word ever reached her that Eliza's eldest daughter married a Eurasian
named Pratt. As thorough as ever, Dr Bristowe traced that family, too, and
made the engaging discovery the youngest child of the union - that is, Anna's
grand-nephew - became the actor Boris Karloff, of Frankenstein fame.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">There is also evidence to suggest
Anna's performance may not have been flawless during her five years in Bangkok.
The capital's small British colony of merchants and consular officials never
asked her into their circle, despite her position at court. The only respectable
foreigners willing to take her at her word were American Protestant missionaries,
particularly the formidable Dr Dan Beach Bradley, their senior member. These
men and women gave her the friendship she needed so badly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">The inventions and distortions
of her books may have been partly designed to boost sales, as Prince Damrong,
one of King Mongkut's sons, suggested to Dr Bristowe in a 1930 meeting.
It could also be argued, they were also possibly aimed at convincing her
missionary friends that Anna Leonowens was truly a virtuous Christian woman,
worthy of their trusting kindness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Times New Roman">After leaving Thailand, Anna spent
some years in America, where her books were written, and eventually settled
in Canada with her daughter. There she died in 1915 at the ripe old age
of 85 (not 82 as her family and friends thought), still playing, by now
with accomplished skill, a role that might have challenged the best of her
later impersonators.</FONT></P>
