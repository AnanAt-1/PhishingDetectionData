<h2><a id="Setting">Setting up the system requirements</a></h2>

<p>These instructions explain how to install Amaya with fink, which makes it
a lot easier. They should provide enough information to install it even if
you don't use fink, but comments and improvements are always welcome.</p>

<h3>Fink, Compilers and other tools</h3>

<p>Fink is a packaging system for OS X. It provides tools to install software
originally developed as open-source Unix software, and most importantly it
manages dependencies (i.e. if you want to install Amaya it will make sure
libpng is installed so Amaya can run) and updates (if there is a new version
of Amaya packaged, you can update to it with a one-line command or using a
piece of software with a relatively simple interface).</p>

<p>To install fink, follow the instructions at <a
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/">fink's download page</a>. Note
that you will need the developer tools (in OS 10.3 they are called XCode, and
are on a separate disc, not installed by default). You can also download them
(after registering) from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx">Apple's
developer site</a>. Be warned - it is around 200MB.</p>

<h3>X11, Gtk, and friends</h3>

<p>There are a number of things you need in order to install Amaya. The most
important is X11 - the X Window system that Amaya runs under. This can be
installed from Apple, or using fink.</p>

<p>If you are using fink you only need to decide whether to install Apple's
X11 or install it as provided by fink. Once you have installed one or the
other, fink will install everything else you need.</p>

<h4>Apple's X11 beta release</h4>

<p>Download and install both the x11 package and the Developer's kit package
from <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/">Apple's X11 site</a></p>

<p>(It seems that if you use the current beta - apple's second version - you
no longer need to download and run the <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/*checkpout*/fink/fix-finkl/install_name_fix.pl">fink
repair script for Apple's X11 libraries</a>.)</p>

<p>You then need to run the command:</p>

<p><kbd>sudo apt-get install system-xfree86</kbd></p>

<h4>The fink-provided X11</h4>

<p>Note: You can get away with not doing this step - fink or apt-get will
normally install this automatically because Amaya lists it as a
dependency.</p>

<p><kbd>sudo apt-get xfree86-base</kbd></p>

<p>will install X11. You should also install a local rootless X server (if
you don't know what this means, you need to do it - if you do then you have
the option of running a remote X server without installing the package)</p>

<p><kbd>sudo apt-get xfree86-rootless</kbd></p>

<h2><a id="Using1">Installing from a binary package of Amaya</a>
(easiest)</h2>

<p>run the command</p>

<p><kbd>sudo apt-get install amaya</kbd></p>

<p>That's it. Apt-get will install several libraries that Amaya needs if you
don't already have them, as well as the Amaya code itself. If you agree to
everything it suggests, there should be no problems - if you have some reason
for doing something differently you need to understand what you are doing.
When it has done its work, you will have Amaya installed.</p>

<p id="package">Alternatively, <a
href="../../Amaya/Distribution/amaya_8.5-1_darwin-powerpc.deb">version 8.5 as
a fink debian package</a> is now available from the Amaya site. You can
download that package and install it with the command</p>

<p><kbd>sudo dpkg -i amaya_8.5-1_darwin-powerpc.deb</kbd></p>

<h2><a id="Using2">Using fink to compile Amaya</a> (easy)</h2>

<p>Make sure you have the current package list.</p>

<p><kbd>fink selfupdate-cvs</kbd></p>

<p>Once you have set up your system requirements, run the following command
to install amaya for the first time:</p>

<p><kbd>fink install amaya</kbd></p>

<p>(This will install the GTK version of Amaya, which is the standard version
now. If you have installed an older version it this method should replace
it.)</p>

<p>Fink will then download Amaya (and anything else it needs that is not
already installed) and compile it</p>

<h2><a id="Upgrading">Upgrading Amaya via fink or apt-get</a></h2>

<p>If you have installed Amaya 5.3 using fink or apt-get, then you can
upgrade. Use the same process as for installing, but change the command
install to upgrade - for example</p>

<p><kbd>fink selfupdate-cvs</kbd></p>

<p><kbd>fink update amaya</kbd></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><kbd>sudo apt-get update</kbd></p>

<p><kbd>sudo apt-get upgrade amaya</kbd></p>

<h3><a id="have">If you have installed amaya-gtk</a></h3>

<p>Until version 6.1 there were two versions of Amaya - one relied on Motif
and one relied on GTK. The GTK version was recommended, but both were
available as packages. From version 7.1 the GTK version is the only one
supported, so there is only one package, called amaya, and using GTK.</p>

<p>If you want to upgrade from amaya-gtk to a new version of amaya you should
follow the instructions for installing amaya (recommended is to <a
href="#Using1">install amaya via apt-get</a>, because it is quicker). This
will replace your existing amaya-gtk cleanly, and in future you can upgrade
amaya as usual.</p>

<p>If you are planing to use the fink unstable to get the latest version the
instructions given below include this step.</p>

<h2><a id="Using">Using fink unstable to get the latest version (not very
hard)</a></h2>

<p>Often you will find there is a later version of Amaya in the unstable
tree. To check if this is the case, look at the entry for <a
href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/amaya">amaya in the fink
package database</a>.</p>

<p>If there is a newer version in the unstable tree and you are not generally
using the unstable version of fink, you can still use fink to install the
later version.as follows</p>

<p>First you need to update the data fink has about packages:</p>
<pre><kbd>fink selfupdate-cvs</kbd></pre>

<p>then tweak your local fink setup so it compiles the newer version (copy
the package information, then update the index that fink uses):</p>
<pre><kbd>sudo cp /sw/fink/dists/unstable/main/finkinfo/web/amaya* /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/

fink index</kbd></pre>

<p>if you have a previous version of Amaya installed with fink or apt-get,
use the upgrade command</p>

<p><kbd>fink update amaya</kbd></p>

<p>if you do not have amaya installed, or if you have a package called
amaya-gtk installed, use the install command</p>

<p><kbd>fink install amaya</kbd></p>

<p>(Note that from version 7.1 onwards the -gtk extension has been dropped.
This is because the GTK-based package is now the default, and is the only one
currently supported in fink).</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4>If it fails because of a "failed dependency"...</h4>

<p>Sometimes fink will refuse to install or upgrade an unstable version,
giving a message like</p>

<p><samp>Dependency failed (imlib-shlib &gt;= 1.9.14)</samp></p>

<p>This means that fink couldn't find a package, or a recent enough version
of a package, that Amaya relies on. Usually the required package will be in
the list of unstable packages (just like Amaya itself).</p>

<p>What you need to do is find the package, move it to the local list,
rebuild the index, and then do the install or update.</p>

<p>As an example, on 7 May 2003 the version of Amaya in the stable package
list was 7.1 and latest package available was version 7.2. Installing this
version fails with the error message above.</p>

<h5>Finding the package:</h5>

<p>The best way is to search the fink package database for the name of the
package that was not found. in the example above searching for
<kbd>imlib-shlib</kbd> gives the fink imlib-shlib package's page. From this
you can see three important pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The actual <strong>name</strong> of the package (in this case
    <strong>imlib-shlib</strong>)</li>
  <li>The <strong>version number</strong> available in the "current unstable"
    release (in this case 1.9.14-2, read as version <strong>1.9.14</strong>
    revision 2) and</li>
  <li>The <strong>section</strong> that the package is in (in this case
    <strong>graphics</strong>).</li>
</ol>

<h5>moving it into the local index, and rebuilding it:</h5>

<p>This is the same process as with the amaya package. For our example, the
following two commands do it:</p>

<p><kbd>sudo cp
/sw/fink/dists/unstable/main/finkinfo/<strong>graphics</strong>/<strong>imlib-shlib</strong>-<strong>1.9.14</strong>*
/sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/</kbd></p>

<p><kbd>fink index</kbd></p>

<p>(<strong>graphics</strong> in this example is the section the package is
in. Other packages may be in other sections, most likely lib or X11.
<strong>imlib-shlib</strong> is the name of the package, and
<strong>1.9.14</strong> is the version number, without the revision number.
The asterisk/star "*" is there to ensure that all the necessary files are
copied.)</p>

<p>You are now ready to install or upgrade Amaya in the "normal" way with:</p>

<p><kbd>fink update amaya</kbd></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><kbd>fink install amaya</kbd></p>

<h2><a id="Compiling">Compiling your own (more challenging)</a></h2>

<p>Joseph Myers reports successfully <a
href="http://www.myersdaily.org/joseph/notes/software.html#9-7-03">compiling
version 8.1b</a> without necessarily installing fink.</p>

<p>The following notes are for compiling version 8.3.</p>

<h3>First steps</h3>

<p>As usual, I recommand that you read the instruction for compilation at
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html. The build process is unchanged,
but you may need some tricks to complete a successful build.</p>

<p>Go to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html#L438">"How
to build" section</a> and follow steps 1 and 2 :</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you have downloaded a tarball, unpack it<br />
    <kbd>tar xfvz amaya-src-xxx.tgz</kbd><br />
    <kbd>cd Amaya</kbd></li>
  <li>Create a subdirectory for darwin<br />
    <kbd>mkdir darwin</kbd></li>
</ol>

<h3>Easy way (without i18n):</h3>

<p>Step 3 is the "configure" script:<br />
<kbd>../configure --host=ppc --build=ppc --with-gtk --without-i18n</kbd></p>

<p>If it fails to generate Makefile, config.h and so on, you should install
GNU sed from fink and retry configure.</p>
<kbd>sudo fink install sed</kbd>

<p>(Choose distfiles.opendarwin.org as mirror if needed)</p>

<p>Then Step 4:</p>

<p><strong>In Options:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>verify that -D_I18N_ is removed for Amaya and Thotlib</li>
  <li>verify that -D_GTK is present</li>
  <li>verify some paths for GTK (gtk-config may forget the basic
  /sw/include):</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li><code>GTK_INCLUDES=-I/sw/include/gtk-1.2 -I/sw/include/glib-1.2
    -I/sw/lib/glib/include -I/usr/X11R6/include -I/sw/include</code></li>
  <li><code>GTK_LIBRARIES=-L/sw/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lgtk -lgdk -lgmodule
    -lglib -ldl -lintl -lX11 -lXext -lm -lgdk-imlib</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And a special trick to avoid conflicts with some Apple frameworks:</p>

<p><strong>In config.h:</strong></p>

<p>It is important to undefine something related to APPKIT because AppKit in
MacOSX is not what is expected by amaya.</p>

<p>So <strong>comment</strong> the following line if present:</p>

<p><code>/* #define HAVE_APPKIT_APPKIT_H 1 */</code></p>

<p>You could have to do the same in <strong>libwww/wwwconf.h</strong></p>

<p>Here is Step 5:</p>

<p>Just <kbd>gnumake</kbd> it!</p>

<p><strong>Additional information for Amaya &gt;= 7.x and MacOSX &gt;
10.0</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>[Version 8.x]</em> In batch/Makefile, this is an additional space
    to remove after -L:
    <pre>THOT_OPTIONS = -L ../</pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>[Version 8.x]</em> If you see a problem with malloc.h, the easiest
    workaround is to add a symbolic link
    <pre>ln -s /usr/include/malloc/malloc.h /usr/include/malloc.h</pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>[Not for Version 8.3]</em> You will probably get problems with
    libwww's configure script. If the host type is not recognized, edit the
    darwin/Makefile: After the lines
    <pre>  $$libwwwdir/configure \
            --disable-shared \ </pre>
    add the following: <code>--host=ppc \</code></li>
  <li><em>[still for Version 8.3]</em> You will probably get problems with
    libraptor's libtool script, because the default setup of the dynamic
    linker has changed between OSX 10.0 and 10.1: it now uses
    -twolevel-namespace by default, which is incompatible with -undefined
    suppress. Edit darwin/libraptor/libtool and add -flat_namespace.
    <pre># Flag that allows shared libraries with undefined symbols to be built.
allow_undefined_flag="-flat_namespace -undefined suppress"</pre>
  </li>
  <li><em>[Version 7.1 only]</em> There was a problem with unit_64 type in
    AHTURLTools.c. Edit darwin/../amaya/AHTURLTools.c and add
    <pre>#include "stdint.h"</pre>
    There was a more serious bug due to system constants (FILENAME_MAX),
    described in <a
    href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya-dev/2003Jan/0015.html">www-amaya-dev
    list archive</a>. It's corrected in 7.2 so I strongly advise you to
    compile 7.2 instead of 7.1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dark side of the i18n support:</h3>

<p>If you really want i18n support, then be prepared to work a little more.
Let's start again from step 3. Replace the configure command by this one:
<code>../configure --host=ppc --with-gtk</code></p>

<p>Then go through Step 4 but now -D_I18N_ must be present for Thotlib and
Amaya in Options file. The following instructions work for Amaya 6.4 and
7.x</p>

<p>Since Darwin, like BSD systems, does not have wchar support in libc, you
have to use a workaround for it:</p>
<ol>
  <li><kbd>cd ../thotlib/include/</kbd><br />
    Edit <code>ustring.h</code> around line 55 to get:
    <pre>	<code>#ifdef _I18N_
	/*#include &lt;wchar.h&gt;  DOES NOT EXIST IN MACOSX */
	#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;   /* defines BSD_WCHAR_T  */
	typedef wchar_t  CHAR_T;
	typedef wchar_t *STRING;
	typedef long int wint_t;  /* was in wchar.h in other systems */
	#else  /* _I18N_ */
	/* don't touch anything else */</code>
	</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Now you need the corresponding functions, since they are not in libc
    either.If you don't have them, you'll get a bunch of undefined symbols
    when linking. So download these from a libc source and hack to compile
    them.<br />
    No, i'm kidding. All this is done for you!<strong></strong>libwcs is now
    available from fink unstable, as lib/libwcs-1.0-2.info so you can use the
    following three commands to install it.
    <pre><kbd>sudo cp /sw/fink/dists/unstable/main/finkinfo/lib/libwcs-1.0-2.info /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo</kbd><kbd>fink index</kbd>
<kbd>fink install libwcs</kbd></pre>
    <p>Or you can download the <a href="libwcs.tar.gz">libwcs source</a> in
    your /tmp. Unpack it, compile it and install it:<br />
    </p>
    <pre><kbd>tar xfvz libwcs.tar.gz
cd wcs
make libwcs.a
mv libwcs.a /sw/lib</kbd></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Go back to Amaya/darwin/ directory<br />
    Edit <code>Options</code> to complete <code>EXTRA_LIBS</code> with:
    <pre>	EXTRA_LIBS = -L/sw/lib -lwcs
	</pre>
    <p>And add an option to the cc:</p>
    <pre>	CC  = cc -no-cpp-precomp
	</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Now <kbd>cd batch/</kbd><br />
    Edit <code>Makefile</code> to use these <code>EXTRA_LIBS</code>
    <pre>	LIBS  = ../thotlib/libThotKernel.a $(EXTRA_LIBS)
	</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now you should be able to build it:<br />
<kbd>cd ..</kbd><br />
<kbd>gmake</kbd></p>
