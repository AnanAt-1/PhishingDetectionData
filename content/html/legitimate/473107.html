 SIZE=+1> - <I>Leavetaking</I> (CD, <B>Sarathan</B>, Soft pop)<BR>
The second full-length release from <B>Peter Bradley Adams</B>. A word of
warning. If you're looking for loud upbeat aggressive stuff, you won't find
it here. This young fellow writes and records songs that are smooth, smooth,
<I>smooth</I>...and very laidback. Although he grew up in the South (Birmingham),
Peter's music has little in common with what people are accustomed to hearing
from the state of Alabama...so this is perhaps why he decided to relocate
(?). In a very short amount of time, Adams has managed to connect with some
impressive folks. Most people will probably be surprised at how mature the
songs on <I>Leavetaking</I> are. Peter isn't recording songs hoping for
an instant hit. His thoughtful soft pop tunes are classy and classic in
nature...and feature wonderfully simple arrangements that allow the listener
to focus on his intelligent lyrics and exceptional voice. The more we spin
this one...the better it sounds. Nine clever cuts here including &quot;The
Longer I Run,&quot; &quot;Under My Skin,&quot; and &quot;Song For Viola.&quot;

Dark Band</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>Music To Stand By The Fireplace
To</I> (Independently released CD, Progressive pop)<BR>
If the name of the album isn't enough to grab your attention (<I>Music To
Stand By The Fireplace To...? Yee-haw...!</I>)...then the cover photo of
the band dressed like squares all happily gathered around the fireplace
will almost <I>surely</I> make you laugh out loud. <B>Alexander's Dark Band</B>
is a confusing entity that is bound to be a confusing and obscure oddity
in the months and years ahead. Instead of going for one style or sound...these
folks create songs that just don't really fit any particular genre. In some
ways the songs sound extremely preprogrammed...but in other ways some elements
seem purposely loose and accidental. The band consists of <B>Annalise Ohse,
Brian Beadle, Callie Sparrow, Jake Buchert, Jeff Luna</B>, and <B>Sara Peanut
Lawson</B>. We couldn't even <I>begin</I> to rate this one...so we'll leave
it up to you to determine exactly what it is <I>you</I> think these folks
are up to...? <B>Mr. Rogers</B> meets <B>The Flaming Lips</B> perhaps...?
Whatever it is...it is most certainly <I>creative</I> (!)... (Not Rated)</FONT></P>

 SIZE=+1> - <I>A Long, Lovely List of Repairs</I> (CD, <B>Adrenaline</B>,
Soft pop)<BR>
Portland, Oregon's <B>Amelia</B> create smooth, exotic soft pop that is
compelling, genuine, and real. The band consists of <B>Teisha Helgerson</B>,
<B>Scott Weddle</B>, <B>Jesse Emerson</B>, and <B>Mark Orton</B>. The musicians
play a wide variety of instruments while Helgerson sings and plays drums.
If we heard this music without knowing any specific details, we would have
guessed that the band is Spanish. The tracks on <I>A Long, Lovely List of
Repairs</I> have a lot in common with many of the modern progressive pop
bands we have heard coming out of Spain in the twenty-first century. The
band's third album is mature and complex...and yet ultimately soothing and
subtle. There's no way of knowing whether this will be a commercial success
or not...but we are absolutely certain that critics will go apeshit over
this album. Killer tunes include &quot;Farewell,&quot; &quot;Tragedy,&quot;
&quot;Thick as Thieves,&quot; and &quot;Here We Are.&quot; Recommended.

- <I>Banishment Rituals of the Disenlightened</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.blrrecords.com/">Beta-lactam
Ring</A></B>, Progressive/experimental)<BR>
Jesus <I>Christ</I>...this is one <I>goddamn spooky sounding</I> album.
<B>Anakrid</B> (hard to pronounce that one...) is the project created by
<B>Chris Bickel</B> who was previously in the bands <B>In/Humanity</B> and
<B>Guyana Punch</B>. These days Bickel isn't rocking out as much as he is
(probably) weirding people out. The seemingly-seriously-titled <I>Banishment
Rituals of the Disenlightened</I> is a bizarre spin indeed...drawing comparisons
to various other experimental artists on the increasingly perplexing Beta-lactam
Ring label. Industrial atmospherics collide with all kinds of peculiar found
sounds to create a feeling of unrest and unease as Chris creates an audio
world that is both compelling and confusing. There are no lyrics...no catchy
choruses...nothing that the casual listener could possibly latch onto. This
is abstract sound for listeners who want that certain something <I>more</I>
from their music. The more we hear this...the stranger it <I>sounds</I>.
Critical Listening 101 that could potentially lead to a nervous breakdown.

<P><A NAME="anchor50101"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2><A HREF="http://www.beforetherains.net/">Before
The Rains</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>Original Motion Picture Soundtrack:
Music by <B>Mark Kilian</B></I><B> </B>(CD, <B>Lakeshore</B>, Soundtrack)<BR>
<B>Mark Kilian</B> has created a very smooth soundtrack album for the film
<I>Before The Rains</I>. This CD features nineteen slick tracks that combine
ideas and sounds from several different cultures. Call it modern world music
for the twenty-first century, if you will. As of this writing we have not
yet seen the film. But our guess is that the story is serious and the plot
moves along slowly. Recorded at Gravy Street Music in Venice, California,
these songs feature impeccable sound quality and precise attention to detail.
Kilian manages to come up with a nice big thick sound that never comes across
sounding too busy or overproduced. There's a lot to take in here...nineteen
tracks including &quot;Honey Drive,&quot; &quot;Before the Rains,&quot;
&quot;All Quiet,&quot; and &quot;The Prayer.&quot; Subtle and cerebral.

Pilot</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>Three Rounds and a Sound</I> (CD,
<B><A HREF="http://www.expungedrecords.com/">Expunged</A></B>, Soft pop)<BR>
Nice, simple, stark soft pop. <B>Blind Pilot</B> is the duo consisting of
<B>Israel Nebeker</B> and <B>Ryan Dobrowski</B> with several friends offering
instrumental support. <I>Three Rounds and a Sound</I> is a wistful, laidback
album that presents songs simply and without unnecessary fanfare...thus
allowing listeners to easily focus on the words and melodies. Because the
average listener is accustomed to hearing pop music overpolished and overproduced
to death, the straightforward sounds on this album will probably sound odd
and peculiar. And this seems rather odd...because this album presents the
<I>real</I> sound of these artists as opposed to canned technology blurring
the central image. Of course when you leave yourself naked for the world
to interpret, you had better have some good songs...some <I>really</I> <I>good
damn songs</I>. And that is exactly what makes <I>Sound</I> such a strong
album. These songs really <I>are</I> excellent. Fans of folk and soft pop
will likely get a mighty big charge out of these tunes if they will just
relax and pay attention. Classy pensive cuts include &quot;Oviedo,&quot;
&quot;Paint or Pollen&quot; (a particularly strong cut), &quot;Two Towns
From Me,&quot; and &quot;Things I Cannot Recall.&quot; (Rating: 5+)<BR>

Breakups</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>Eat Your Heart Out EP</I> (Independently
released CD, Pop)<BR>
A short and sweet little EP from Hollywood, California's <B>The Breakups</B>.
The band presents eight short tunes on <I>Eat Your Heart Out</I>...pure
feelgood guitar pop that is, at times, highly reminiscent of college radio
pop from the mid- to late-1980s. Main songwriter <B>Jake Gideon</B> has
a great knack for turning a good hummable tune...and the band plays simply
and without unnecessary instrumental passages. Great EPs are those that
leave the listener wanting more...and this one does <I>just that</I>. Catchy
tracks include &quot;Breaking Up,&quot; &quot;Day in the Sun,&quot; &quot;After
the Fact,&quot; and &quot;Let's See What Happens.&quot; Some of these tracks
remind us just a teeny tiny bit...of <B>The Archies</B> (?!?)... (Rating:

Calla Lily Company</B>, Pop)<BR>
If there is any up-and-coming underground band with the potential to become
a hugely popular supernova...it is most surely <B>Brothers and Sisters</B>.
The folks in this band write and record super hummable soft pop tunes that
have the same overall feeling and vibe of some of the tunes from the great
lost bubblegum band <B>The Mamas and Papas</B>. But instead of being a 1960s
rehash, <I>Fortunately</I> ends up coming across like a modern pop album
that simply draws pure inspiration from the past. The songs on this album
are, in a word...<I>happy</I>. That will probably be enough to scare off
half of the younger listeners out there...but fortunately there are a lot
of folks at this point in time who want <I>and need</I> music that provides
escapism. The band is driven by the superlative songwriting skills of <B>Will
Courtney</B>. There is no doubt that this guy writes some of the best upbeat
catchy tunes around. Fantastic cuts include &quot;Mason City,&quot; &quot;You're
Gone&quot; (<I>god, what a tune...!</I>), &quot;The Wind,&quot; &quot;The
Trees Are Bare,&quot; and &quot;Fortunately.&quot; Highly recommended. (Rating:

<P><A NAME="anchor30952"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Harold Budd &amp; Clive Wright</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> - <I>A Song for Los Blossoms</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.darla.com/">Darla</A></B>,
Instrumental)<BR>
<I>A Song for Los Blossoms</I> was recorded over a two-year period in a
variety of locations. These collaborative recordings are subtle, smooth,
cerebral, and very, very beautiful. <B>Harold Budd</B> and <B>Clive Wright</B>
are a perfect match for one another. Budd is widely known as one of the
original creators of ambient music in the twentieth century while Wright
was originally in the band <B>Cock Robin</B> and has worked with numerous
heavyweight artists over the years. The tracks on this album may remind
some listeners of the early recordings by <B>Brian Eno</B> and <B>Robert
Fripp</B>...except the overall sound is much more sparse and restrained.
Though this album only includes seven tracks it clocks in at over 74 minutes...which
gives the listener plenty of time to kick back, relax, and allow the subtle
nuances to be fully absorbed. Richly rewarding and intricate. Recommended.

 SIZE=+1> - <I>Defektor</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.bar-none.com/">Bar/None</A></B>,
Pop)<BR>
The debut solo album from <B>Greg Camp</B> who is best known as the guitarist
and songwriter in the ultra-popular band <B>Smashmouth</B>. Smashmouth has
always been somewhat of a confusing paradox for us. After all, we should
<I>hate</I> the band...but instead we have always rather admired them. In
the end, it was the songs that made the band stand out from thousands of
other crass commercial acts. Camp penned most of the band's hits...so it
is not surprising that some of the tunes on <I>Defektor</I> resemble some
Smashmouth tunes. But there is one big difference...the songs on this album
are much less obvious and feature a much wider range in terms of sound and
scope. Considering how prolific and multi-talented Mr. Camp is, it seems
rather surprising that it took him this long to release a solo CD. But timing
is everything...and the timing of this disc seems perfect now that most
folks probably perceive Smashmouth as a novelty act from the past. Camp
has done a beautiful job of creating an album that will please Smashmouth
fans...while still retaining total and complete artistic credibility. Not
surprisingly, the sound quality is superb. These tunes are slick and thickly
produced...but it all adds (rather than detracts) to the overall vibe. The
more we spin this one...the better these songs sound. Cool, smart, uplifting
cuts include &quot;The Maid,&quot; &quot;Gina Marie,&quot; &quot;Baby Please
Don't Go,&quot; and &quot;Deaf.&quot; (Rating: 5+)<BR>

 SIZE=+1> - <I>Doubly Unbeatable</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.hhbtm.com/">Happy
Happy Birthday To Me</A></B>, Pop/rock)<BR>
There aren't many bands that can make us laugh out loud...but the folks
in <B>Cars Can Be Blue</B> do just that. The band is the duo consisting
of <B>Becky Ann Brooks</B> and <B>Nate Mitchell</B>. Becky and Nate record
a hyperactive brand of garage girlie pop that sounds not unlike a modern
cross between <B>The Fastbacks</B> and <B>Oh, OK</B>. You might be inclined
to dismiss the lead track (&quot;Sun Blows Up&quot;) as flippant teenie
bopper fodder...until you notice Brooks is singing the line <I>Gonna love
him 'til the sun blows up</I> (yee haw!). &quot;Pretty Special&quot; is
a totally sarcastic swipe at obnoxious rock and roll pussies that ought
to give just about anyone a good hearty chuckle. From a musical standpoint,
<I>Doubly Unbeatable</I> is somewhat of a mixed bag. Some songs are really
great while there are a few throwaway cuts. But when the overall vibe is
this genuine and the folks making the music have such a keen sense of humor...well
sheesh and goddamn, you just can't <I>help</I> but be pulled into their
strange little universe. Nifty garage pop tracks include &quot;I Wish I,&quot;
&quot;Cycle of Violence,&quot; &quot;So Cheap,&quot; and &quot;Seems We're
Breakin' Up.&quot; Fun stuff...! (Rating: 4+++++)<BR>

Rock)<BR>
Really neat modern progressive pop with a technological slant. The folks
in <B>Darker My Love</B> have a thick dense sound...but their songs mainly
emphasize vocal melodies with catchy choruses. Some of the tracks on <I>2</I>
recall some of the more hazy and progressive underground British bands from
the 1990s (the band <B>Charlatans UK</B> instantly comes to mind). These
folks record songs that are ultimately upbeat and danceable...but they are
by no means generic mindless disco. There is a great deal of emphasis on
effects and studio wizardry...but instead of using it to cover up for a
lack of great songs, these folks use technology to push their music to the
next level. The songs are heady, smart, and inventive...yet ultimately easy
to listen to. This album sounds <I>great</I> turned up really loud with
all the windows down. Or...if you're looking for a really dynamite album
to work out to...this is <I>most definitely it</I>. Eleven kickass cuts
here including &quot;Northern Soul,&quot; &quot;Blue Day&quot; (a really
spectacular tune), &quot;Two Ways Out,&quot; &quot;Even In Your Lightest
Day,&quot; and &quot;Immediate Undertaking.&quot; A totally <I>killer</I>
album. Highly recommended. (Rating: 5+++)<BR>

 SIZE=+1> - <I>Palaces</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.antennafarmrecords.com/">Antenna
Farm</A></B>, Pop)<BR>
The fourth album from <B>Bart Davenport</B>. Bart has previously done vocal
work for <B>DJ Greyboy</B> and, prior to launching his solo career, was
the lead singer in the band <B>Honeycut</B>. <I>Palaces</I> is a nice, smooth,
interesting slice of modern pop. Davenport incorporates sounds and styles
from classic pop and philly soul into a catchy and intoxicating mix. The
tracks on this album recall some of the more soulful pop artists from the
1970s that were once played into the ground on commercial FM radio stations.
The key identifying trademark of Bart's sound, however, are his vocals.
This guy has a super smooth understated voice that is immediately relaxed
and effective. This is one of those albums that would be very difficult
to dislike...no matter <I>what</I> your musical tastes might be. Cool uplifting
tracks include &quot;Palaces,&quot; &quot;A Young One&quot; (excellent backing
vocals here), &quot;Yoshi,&quot; and &quot;Born to Suffer.&quot; Super smooth
nice sounding stuff... (Rating: 5)<BR>

(Double CD, <B>Sanctuary</B>, Pop)<BR>
The name <B>Rob Dickinson</B> might not instantly ring a bell...but readers
will no doubt remember Great Britain's <B>Catherine Wheel</B> from the 1990s.
The band achieved an impressive amount of success before disappearing into
infinity without any warning or explanation. <I>Fresh Wine for the Horses</I>
is a reissue of Dickinson's debut album with a bonus disc (<I>Nude</I>)
featuring re-recordings of six Catherine Wheel tunes. This album will no
doubt please fans of Rob's previous band. The songs are smooth, intricate,
highly melodic...and prove that his voice sounds just as good now as it
ever did. One important thing to consider here. In order to appreciate <I>Horses</I>
you do <I>not</I> need to be a Catherine Wheel fan. Rob has created a pure,
classy collection of modern pop tunes that should please just about any
discerning pop music fan. The company that first released this album dissolved...leaving
the album without a proper home. Let's hope that this time around this album
gets the recognition it deserves. Cool calculated cuts include &quot;My
Name is Love,&quot; &quot;The End of the World,&quot; &quot;Handsome,&quot;
&quot;The Night,&quot; and &quot;Mutineer.&quot; (Rating: 5)<BR>

Although we're not exactly certain why, it took many many spins for <I>Smoke
Rings</I> to finally sink in. The album didn't make much of an impression
(either positive or negative) on us initially...but there was something
about <B>Dri</B>'s music that made us keep coming back for more. Dri played
previously in the bands <B>The Anniversary</B>, <B>Art In Manila</B>, and
<B>Fourth of July</B> but now she's out on her own...and this is her debut
solo release. The songs on <I>Smoke Rings</I> are slightly soulful and based
around odd synthetic percussion. All sorts of surprising instruments and
sounds pop in and out of the mix...with the one continuous thread being
Dri's ultra-focused and captivating voice. You might guess, upon hearing
this album, that Dri is European. Not the case. This young enchanting lady
is from <I>Lawrence, Kansas</I> (!). There's no way of telling if music
fans will appreciate this or not...but our guess is that the critics are
gonna go <I>apeshit</I> over this one. Cool eclectic tracks include &quot;Two
Are One,&quot; &quot;Indria,&quot; &quot;You Know I Tried,&quot; &quot;Hot
As Hades,&quot; and &quot;Smoke Rings.&quot; Recommended. (Rating: 5++)<BR>

Soft progressive pop)<BR>
The last album we heard from <B>Liz Durrett</B> was a top pick. <I>Outside
Our Gates</I> is yet another <I>easy </I>top pick here in the totally plush
<I>babysue</I> office suites. Durrett's third full-length release was produced
by <B>Eric Bachmann</B> (<B>Archers of Loaf</B>, <B>Crooked Fingers</B>).
<I>Gates</I> features absolutely warm and inviting soft progressive pop
tunes that stick in the mind like glue. There are lots of guest artists
featured on this album...no less than thirteen additional players including
Bachmann, <B>Eric Harris</B>, <B>Lucy Ralston</B>, and <B>Vic Chesnutt</B>.
Unlike most twenty-first century generic artists, Liz has her own intriguing
sound and style. The more you hear her music...the more difficult and confusing
it is trying to come up with comparisons and/or possible influences. The
sound quality is exceptional...and the horn and string arrangements add
just the right amount of thickness to the overall sound. At the heart of
it all are Durrett's impressively sincere and understated vocals. This young
lady has an incredible voice. Her genuine presence comes through loud and
clear. Personal and richly rewarding tunes include &quot;Wake To Believe,&quot;
&quot;We Build Bridges&quot; (<I>incredible...!</I>), &quot;All of Them
All,&quot; and &quot;The Sea A Dream.&quot; This is one of the most beautiful
albums we have heard this year...and destined to be remembered as one of
the best CDs of 2008. <I>Highly recommended</I>. (Rating: 6)<BR>

Beach Music</A></B>, Progressive pop)<BR>
We have become increasingly transfixed on Canadian musical artists over
the past decade. For whatever reason, Canada seems to be producing artists
that are (in most cases) about ten times more credible and interesting than
their American counterparts. The four ladies in Vancouver's <B>E.S.L.</B>
are particularly interesting because their music sounds neither American
<I>nor</I> Canadian. <I>Eye Contact</I> is an odd spin. Some of the songs
sound like gypsy folk songs...other songs have a slightly Polka-like feel
(?), while others are pure artistic endeavors that don't easily fit into
the framework of any specific musical genre. These girls have an overall
sound that is striking and unusual...yet surprisingly easy on the ears.
The strings and vocals sound absolutely <I>superb</I>. This is a different
sort of album that isn't easily described or digested...but one that will
have definite staying power in the years to come. Substantial compositions
include &quot;Secretariat,&quot; &quot;I Don't Buy It,&quot; &quot;Not About
You,&quot; and &quot;Venus In Furs.&quot; Recommended. (Rating: 5++)<BR>

Hard space rock)<BR>
Swirling, persistent, psychedelic, and focused. The guys in California's
<B>Farflung</B> blew our minds years ago in the 1990s with some of their
early albums. We were as pleased as punch to receive this, the band's brand
new batch of rockers. <I>A Wound in Eternity</I> is not only cool as <I>hell</I>...but
it also just might be this band's best album <I>ever</I>. As was the case
in the past, these guys seem to be most influenced by 1970s British drone/drug
lords <B>Hawkwind</B>. This album finds the band sounding super tight...and
delivering some of their most instantly catchy tunes yet. After spinning
<I>Eternity</I> several times...we are hard pressed to think of a twenty-first
century hard rock album that sounds better than this. In addition to the
CD we also received a DVD-R containing the band's video for the tune &quot;Endless
Drifting Wreck.&quot; Very interesting. In the video, the band comes off
looking something like a cross between <B>Devo</B> and <B>The Residents</B>...while
rocking ten times harder than either ever could or would. <I>A Wound in
Eternity</I> represents the guys in Farflung at the zenith of their career.
Let's hope this time around folks take notice...and give these fellows the
support they so obviously deserve. Rip roaring tripped out rockers include
&quot;Unborn Planet,&quot; &quot;Like It Has Never Been,&quot; &quot;Silver
Shrooms, and &quot;Precognition.&quot; Highly recommended. (Rating: 5++++)<BR>

perplexing smart modern bubblegum tunes...this time with a slightly more

<B>Gentlemen Auction House</B> is a big band with a thick big sound. The
band consists of <B>Eric Enger</B> (vocals, guitar), <B>Michael Tomko</B>
(guitar, xylophone, percussion), <B>Steve Kozel</B> (keys, vocals, trumpet,
guitar), <B>Kiley Lewis</B> (keys, vocals, flute), <B>Eric Herbst</B> (bass),
<B>Ryan Adams</B> (full drum kit), and <B>Stephen Tomko</B> (half drum kit,
percussion). We are firm believers of the idea that too many cooks spoil
the broth...but, surprisingly, that is <I>not the case</I> with this band
and their music. <I>Alphabet Graveyard</I> is driven by the keen songwriting
skills of Eric Enger. And although the songs on this album feature thick,
complex arrangements and loads of backing vocals...the songs themselves
manage to stand squarely on their own...always taking center stage. After
spinning this album over a dozen times...we are still kinda confused because
we cannot come up with any instant comparisons and/or possible influences.
This, despite the fact that most of the songs sound surprisingly <I>familiar</I>
(!?!). Whoever they may or may not sound like, these songs feature extremely
memorable melodies and smart lyrics...and they have that <I>certain something</I>
that makes them sound better the more familiar they become. Eleven cool
keepers including &quot;Call It Casual,&quot; &quot;24th,&quot; &quot;New

and Houle write odd and strangely interesting songs that don't follow traditional
and predictable verse/chorus/verse/chorus patterns. Some of the tunes on
<I>Children of the Great Northern Muskeg</I> have a slightly rough, bluesy
edge...while other tracks are more standard pop fare. Many of these songs
have a nice raw quality that comes across sounding slightly unrehearsed
and spontaneous. We can't help but think that during the recording of this
album the band had the good common sense to just let things happen (rather
than planning out every single note). Probably a bit too odd for the casual
listener, <I>Muskeg</I> is a peculiar acquired taste that is well worth
the time spent acquiring it... Interesting stuff. (Rating: 4++++)<BR>

Our guess is that this release will mainly be of interest only to longtime
fans of the band. If so, that would indeed be a shame because--if properly
digested by the public--this will make people realize how incredibly influential
the guys in <B>Goose Creek Symphony</B> have been over the course of the
past few decades. This is a beautifully packaged CD and DVD set. The audio
CD features an album the band recorded in their heyday in the 1970s...but
it was never released and never heard by the public until now. After hearing
this, it seems incredible that these tunes have been sitting around collecting
dust for so long...? Many of the songs on this album rival some of the band's
best material. The DVD features a mini-documentary entitled &quot;You Had
To Be There&quot; that was filmed during the band's 1973 tour...plus various
other tidbits and goodies. The guys in Goose Creek Symphony were playing
their style of country/bluegrass/pop/Americana/rock way, way, WAY before
everyone else eventually jumped on the bandwagon. Hopefully this will expose
the band's music to an entirely new audience...as well as make longtime
fans very, <I>very happy</I>. (Rating: 5)<BR>

Wow...what a <I>rush</I>. While most folks might not know him by name, most
music fans have heard <B>Trey Gunn</B> before. In the past he has played
with a mind-boggling array of other artists including (but not limited to)
<B>King Crimson</B>, <B>David Sylvian</B>, <B>Brian Eno</B>, <B>TOOL</B>,
and <B>Robert Fripp</B>. <I>Music For Pictures</I> contains a wealth of
intriguing material...reconfigured tracks from Gunn's film and scoring works.
The album includes a whopping 29 (!) tracks that skid and slide all over
the road...merging a staggering array of styles and influences. For folks
(like us) who sometimes get tired of artists who always stay within the
safe and dull confines of their specific genre, this album is a truly refreshing
change of pace. Many of these compositions might best be described as progressive
or experimental instrumentals...while others verge on being abstract pop.
Trey enlisted support from some real heavyweights here. <B>Matt Chamberlain</B>,
<B>Pat Mastelotto</B>, <B>Greg Gilmore</B>, <B>Phil Petrocelli</B>, and
<B>Beth Quist</B> all contributed to these recordings. At a point in time
when so many people want to be categorized...Trey Gunn proves that to be
truly original you just have to be yourself. This album is a <I>fantastic</I>
sensory overload. Highly recommended. (Rating: 5+++)<BR>

At this point in his career we can't help but think that <B>Jeff Hanson</B>
and those helping spread the word are extremely sick to death of everyone
making such a big deal about his voice. It would be nice to just be supportive
of this guy without always making the same tired old observation but...<I>damn</I>,
this guy sounds <I>just like</I> a girl. Actually and in fact, he sounds
a <I>lot more</I> like a girl than most <I>female</I> artists sound (!).
If you don't believe it, give a listen to anything Hanson has recorded...and
you will undoubtedly find it hard to believe that the person singing is,
in fact, a male. Now that we've gotten <I>that</I> out of the way (<I>again</I>)...we
are pleased to report that <I>Madam Owl</I> is an excellent album full of
smart, cerebral, and highly melodic soft pop. Now 30 years old, Jeff began
his musical career at the tender age of 13...which might explain the mature
compositions on this album. His songs are smart and reflective and bear
many strange similarities to British pop artists from the 1980s and 1990s.
This is probably Hanson's most fully realized album yet. These songs feature
stunning arrangements that really push the tunes to another level. Twelve
killer cuts here including &quot;Night,&quot; &quot;Maryann,&quot; &quot;The
Last Thing I'll Do,&quot; and &quot;This Friend of Mine.&quot; Recommended.

Canada's <B>Eric Hogg</B> is one of those cool obscure musicians quietly
writing and recording his own refreshingly pure music for what is most likely
a very small but highly appreciative fan base. This CD arrived in our mailbox
in a very simple package...just the CD and a factual one page brief from
Eric himself. Instead of trying to sell himself using a bunch of worthless
gibberish, Hogg instead lets his music speak for itself. And, as it turns
out, this is the best approach for his music since <I>Origins Unknown</I>
speaks for itself. This is Eric's second full-length release. Most listeners
will be surprised at how polished and professional this guy's music is.
Instead of creating underground noise and weird artsy crap, Hogg writes
and records smart, smooth, cerebral pop music that is extremely focused
and genuine. Eric played almost all of the instruments and did all the vocals
himself. But instead of sounding like a one-man project...his music sounds
extraordinarily well-rounded and full. Not much more to say...except that
<I>Origins Unknown</I> is a totally cool little gem truly worthy of your
time and attention. Cool cuts include &quot;The Fallout,&quot; &quot;Origins
Unknown,&quot; &quot;Lost in Static,&quot; and &quot;Silent Nights.&quot;

The familiar little Team Clermont promo sticker on this CD compares <B>Taylor
Hollingsworth</B> to <B>Flat Duo Jets</B>, <B>The Black Keys</B>, and <B>The

But in our minds, the songs on <I>Bad Little Kitty</I> are even more reminiscent
of artists like <B>The Young Fresh Fellows</B> and <B>T. Rex</B>. This is
a very basic album. A very, very, very, <I>very</I> basic album featuring
familiar sounding garage pop rockers. But while it might be easy to just
dismiss this as more of the same...there is one <I>big difference</I> between
the songs on this album and the songs on millions of other albums. These
songs are, quite simply, <I>damn good</I>. Sure, we'll all heard this kind
of music before...bit in this instance it is played with such genuine excitement
that you can't help but move to the music. This album may very well get
lost in the shuffle of the ultra-dull times we're living in. If so, that
would be a damn shame because these nineteen tracks are totally cool and
credible. Top picks: &quot;10 Good Reasons,&quot; &quot;Where Is My Soul,&quot;

Ease</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>Turn It Loose!</I> (CD, <B><A HREF=
"http://www.ionikrecords.com/">Ionik</A></B>, Rock)<BR>
<B>Elizabeth Sharp</B> continues to be one of the most intriguing voices
in music in the twenty-first century. Although she is slowly being accepted
more and more in super hip circles around the world...Sharp continues recording
the same kind of loopy, confusing music that she began recording several
years ago. We have been big fans since the beginning...and our interest
has never waned. What is perhaps most attractive to us about Elizabeth's
music is that it makes us <I>laugh out loud</I>. But don't take this statement
the wrong way. <B>Ill Ease</B> tunes are not purposely humorous and not
specifically comedy. There is just something about this lady's soothingly
loose sound that comes across sounding slightly goofy. And at a time in
music when so many people take themselves way too seriously, this is a refreshing
breath of clean air. Ms. Sharp has one of the most uniquely focused sounds
we have ever heard. To be more precise, there is <I>no one else in the world
who sounds anything like her</I>. She has defined her sound and style into
her own strange form of modern art. To the untrained ear, Ill Ease songs
might initially sound like accidental recordings or even mistakes. But make
no mistake about it...Sharp knows <I>exactly</I> what she is doing. Her
slightly drunk sounding mental stream-of-consciousness pop/rock is a total
experience for intelligent listeners. You can listen to the thought provoking
lyrics...sway and dance to the groovy beats...or just turn it up really
loud and lose track of everything. In a world full of generic copycats...Elizabeth
Sharp continues to expand minds and situations with her infectious and refreshing
music. Nine crazy tracks here including &quot;Here Comes Trouble (To the
Tune of Pretty Woman),&quot; &quot;Two Lanes Left (All the Way),&quot; &quot;My
Last Tango in Paris,&quot; and &quot;Dear Krazy.&quot; <I>Highly recommended</I>.

Jersey Barrier</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>Steady Pace in the Slow
Lane</I> (Independently released CD, Soft pop)<BR>
Sparse, thoughtful, soft pop. No, they aren't from New Jersey...<B>The Jersey
Barrier</B> is a band based in Athens, Georgia and this is their first full-length
release. The band consists of <B>Greg Harmelink</B>, <B>Cara McLanahan</B>,
<B>Rob Walsh</B>, <B>Ash White</B>, and <B>Todd Elihu</B>. The Jersey Barrier
is easily one of the most accessible sounding bands we have heard from Athens.
<I>Steady Pace in the Slow Lane</I> features nice, smooth, melodic tunes
that--with a bit of tweaking and some additional instrumentation--would
not sound at all out of place in the world of commercial music. But our
guess is that commercial success is not the main emphasis for these folks.
The songs are just too genuine and real...and at this point too sparse...to
be digested by casual music fans. As such, <I>Slow Lane</I> will probably
appeal to the specific audience for which it is intended...cool, genuine,
real people seeking cool, genuine, real music. Soothing and serene. (Rating:

Progressive/experimental)<BR>
The first collaboration between experimental artists <B>Andrew Liles</B>
and <B>Daniel Menche</B> recorded from 2006 to 2007 in Portland, Oregon.
<I>The Progeny of Flies</I> is, not surprisingly, an odd spin. The disc
features otherworldly experimental sound collages that are subtle and hypnotic.
The album is divided into four parts: &quot;Eggs,&quot; &quot;1st to 3rd
Instar,&quot; &quot;Pupa,&quot; and &quot;Metamorphosis.&quot; Somehow or
another, these two fellows have managed to effectively present sounds that
seem to embody the world of insects (?). This music is extraordinarily esoteric
and peculiar...not at all intended for the typical music fan. Note that
the first 700 copies are encased in a deluxe book bound case. We have become
huge fans of the Beta-lactam Ring label over the past few months...and <I>The
Progeny of Flies</I> is an excellent example of why we are now so passionately
hypnotized. This is a pure and unique recording that sounds like no other.
An easy TOP PICK for this month... (Rating: 5+++)<BR>

<B>Lewi Longmire</B> is but one of thousands upon thousands of truly talented
musicians in the United States toiling away in obscurity because there are
just not enough listeners in the United States to support all the artists.
Mr. Longmire writes and records what might best be described as Americana
pop. His guitar-based tunes are melodic and mellow...and they showcase what
a great voice this guy has. The timbre of his voice reminds us a great deal
of the vocalist in California's <B>Solipsistics</B>...but the music is totally
different. Lewi has been playing around Portland, Oregon with various folks
for many years. Hopefully this, his second full-length, will spike some
major interest in his solo career...as this man is obviously deserving of
a large audience who can appreciate his honest and genuinely satisfying
tunes. Unlike a lot of underground artists, if the right company was smart
enough to sink some money into this man and his career...he could end up
being <I>hugely</I> successful. Smooth soft rockers include &quot;Moon Song,&quot;
&quot;Disappear,&quot; &quot;Voluntary Martyr,&quot; and &quot;New Lone
Ranger.&quot; (Rating: 5)<BR>

<I>Like 10 Feet Tall</I> the two combine their talents to create smooth

restrained and the overall vibe is cool and laid back. We particularly like
the cover and disc photo...a blurry blueish-green image of a duck or a swan...that
on first glance looks neither like a duck <I>nor</I> a swan. This is not
the sort of album that will clobber you over the head...but will rather
slowly pull you in with its calm and soothing waves of sound... (Rating:

The second full-length release from <B>Mar</B>. The folks in this band have
connections with a slew of super cool hipsters...so many, in fact, that
we don't even need to mention them here. <I>The Silence</I>, the first Mar
album, made quite an impression on a lot of people. <I>The Sound</I> is
bound to have the exact same effect. This album features slick, grandiose,
eloquent, epic progressive pop that is refined and fine-tuned to perfection.
Some of the songs have a rather thick sound (&quot;A Celebration,&quot;
&quot;Mother Star Sun,&quot; &quot;Underwater&quot;)...but our favorites
cuts here are the more stark and subtle ones. The vocals are precise and
exacting...and some of the atmospherics in the background sound absolutely
fabulous. Mar is<B> Kyle J. Reidy</B>, <B>Adam Putman</B>, <B>Ty Denison</B>,
<B>Danny Klein</B>, and <B>Dylan Aycock</B>...along with several other folks
offering helping hands. Artsy yet accessible tunes include &quot;Icarus,&quot;
&quot;Lover,&quot; and &quot;The Atheist.&quot; (Rating: 5)<BR>

appeal equally to fans of progressive experimental sounds as well as fans

team up once again to create some unusual otherworldly music. Not surprisingly

dark and peculiar. The tracks on this album set the mood for what is bound
to be a hypnotic and mesmerizing theater experience. The songs are subdued
and slightly creepy...yet intricate and strangely perplexing. You can bet
that this stuff is going to sound <I>great</I> in a big theater with surround
sound. Twenty-one cuts here including &quot;Blood Train,&quot; &quot;Taking

We really admire the folks in <B>Mio Myo</B>. After all, how many totally
independent bands can create such a strong buzz around the world based totally
on their own recordings and creativity? This EP follows the band's last
full length release <I>Philharmonic Manic Mass Attack</I>...and features
the same sort of striking, melodic, smart progressive pop. The band consists
of <B>Uwe Eger</B>, <B>Thomas Autenrieth</B>, <B>Benni Pollach</B>, and
<B>Michael Angerer</B>. This five-song individually-numbered EP features
five mellow mind-benders: &quot;Switch,&quot; &quot;Unicorns,&quot; Moon
Movie,&quot; &quot;Taxi,&quot; &quot;NYC Mugshots,&quot; and &quot;Pills.&quot;
Groovy, moody, intelligent pop with an unconventional slant. We can't wait

Soft, pensive, melodic soft pop It may or may not be a mere coincidence...but
<B>Mirah</B>'s voice and overall sound are extremely similar to <I>babysue</I>
favorite <B>Lisa Germano</B>. So much so that one can't help but wonder
if Mirah has been heavily influenced by Lisa's music...? <I>The Old Days
Feeling</I> features fourteen stripped down tunes that focus on Mirah's
understated vocals and introspective lyrics. Several pals offer support
here including <B>Phil Elverum</B>, <B>Karl Blau</B>, and <B>Calvin Johnson</B>.
We want to really love this album because the style of music is right up
our alley...but the similarities to Germano are, at times, just a bit too
extreme (?). At least for the time being, we're going to leave this one
without a rating... (Not Rated)</FONT></P>

Extremely well arranged smart progressive pop. The guys in <B>Mock Orange</B>
have been creating music for about a decade now. They've had their ups and
downs along the way...while never losing sight of their central mission.
Recorded in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by <B>Jeremy Ferguson</B>,
<I>Captain Love</I> finds the band sounding as vital and captivating as
ever. The album features twelve progressive mid-tempo pop compositions with
nice flowing melodies and intricate arrangements. Although the band does
experiment with their instruments at times, the overall sound of <I>Captain
Love</I> is extremely accessible. That is to say, millions of pop fans could
easily appreciate this album. The band's unusual vocals are definitely a
trademark of their sound. At times it would be nice to have a break from
the constant thick, dense wall of voices...but given the strength of the
tunes, this seems like a relatively minor thing to be whining about (!).
Groovy hummable tunes include &quot;Captain Love,&quot; &quot;Smile On,&quot;
&quot;Motel Man,&quot; and &quot;Old Movies.&quot; (Rating: 5)<BR>

released CD, Hard noisy rock)<BR>
The guys in <B>Modern Day Urban Barbarians</B> play a style of harsh urban
underground art rock that recalls thousands upon thousands of bands from
the mid to late 1990s who were pushing the boundaries of loud noisy anxiety-fueled
music. Either there are fewer and fewer bands around playing this style
of music...or else the bands and labels releasing this kind of stuff simply
aren't sending us their releases lately (?!?). Whatever the case...<I>Sludgemouth</I>
reminds us of a time when things were getting out of control in the world
of music... Before the tightening grip of censorship began in the twenty-first
century and before the unsettling growth of super safe Christian oriented
rock... So...just who <I>are</I> the Modern Day Urban Barbarians...? The
band is the duo consisting of <B>Devin ZorTon</B> (space bass, vocals) and
<B>Jesse ZorTon</B> (dum drums, vocals). Devin and Jesse play spastic, herky-jerky
noisy rock with intelligent lyrics that are sort of spoken/yelled over bizarre,
unpredictable aggression. These guys' songs are sure to elicit strong reactions
one way or the other. Because they are playing a style of music that we
rarely hear anymore...we have to give these guys bonus points for the plain
and simple fact that they seem to be purposely alienating 98% of the listening
audience... And for that, we most certainly applaud them. Peculiar and harsh.

(Deluxe British import 4 CD set with booklet, <B><A HREF="http://www.angelair.co.uk/">Angel
Air</A></B>, Rock/pop)<BR>
The folks at Angel Air have really outdone themselves this time around.
This four CD package is an <I>absolute must</I> for anyone who ever loved
the music of <B>Mott The Hoople</B>. These live recordings capture the guys
in the band at their absolute mind-riveting peak. Folks who have reservations
about live recordings can put them to rest. These are the best sounding
live Mott recordings we have yet to hear from this time period. Most British
fans will probably not be surprised at how raw this band was in the early
1970s. Most American listeners who are only familiar with &quot;All The
Young Dudes&quot; will almost certainly be somewhat shocked at the intense
hard rock the band played in the early days. These four discs feature the
band playing in Croydon, England, Stockholm, Sweden, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
and other various locations in the United States. CD 1 starts out with a
bang as the band opens (?!) playing a surprisingly cool version of the <B>Neil
Young</B> classic &quot;Ohio&quot; for an appreciative audience in Croydon.
The closing cover of <B>The Kinks</B>' &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; at
this concert is a wild ride indeed and shows just how much of a powerhouse
these guys were in their prime. The disc ends with four tracks recorded
in Stockholm in 1971. The sound quality of the first disc is <I>incredible</I>.
The second CD features an entire concert in Philadelphia. Though the sound
quality is not as great as on the first disc, this concert is exceptional
because it captures the band playing some of their most incredible tunes.
Fans will delight to inspired tight takes on &quot;Jerkin' Crocus,&quot;
&quot;Sucker,&quot; &quot;Ready For Love,&quot; &quot;Sweet Jane,&quot;
&quot;Sea Diver,&quot; &quot;Sweet Angeline,&quot; and &quot;One of the
Boys.&quot; The third disc presents the band playing at various U.S. locations
as their poppier side gels (&quot;Whiskey Women,&quot; &quot;Drivin' Sister,&quot;
&quot;All The Young Dudes,&quot; &quot;All the Way From Memphis&quot;).
The fourth CD presents thirteen tracks recorded during the band's 1974 tour
of the U.S. Interestingly, this disc begins with an odd short take on <B>Don
McLean</B>'s &quot;American Pie&quot;...before the band launches into more
obvious territory (&quot;The Golden Age of Rock'n'Roll&quot;). Rounding
things out is an excellent thick booklet featuring a brief history of the
band and plenty of cool photos. Mott The Hoople fans will want to get hold
of this one ASAP...only 2,000 copies are being offered for sale so... We
would recommend getting your wet little paws on this juicy little sucker
because it is bound to sell out QUICK. <I>Recommended</I>. (Rating: 5+++)<BR>

It can be easy to become supremely bitter about music and the world. After
all, there is so much wrong with everything that it can be difficult to
try to be optimistic and find something or someone worth believing in. While
preachy artists usually turn us off as quickly as they try to turn us on,
we couldn't help but be affected by the seemingly genuine and honest approach
of <B>Mike Musick</B>. Musick is involved in the effort to improve the growing
global water crisis. And while that might at first seem tedious and futile...after
hearing his songs, we can't help but feel that this guy has the right idea
about things and that his heart and soul are in the right place. Beyond
the water crisis there is something even more substantial...Mike's songs.
This guy writes super smooth, super commercial sounding smooth pop that
is slightly soulful. And man, <I>what a voice</I>. Sure, these songs are
too slick and produced for the average alternative noise freak...but folks
into commercial pop will find <I>a lot</I> to love here. Classy hummable
tracks include &quot;Angels on the Radio,&quot; &quot;America,&quot; &quot;Real

<B>Mutlu Onaral</B> prefers to just use his first name...which is probably
a smart decision in terms of marketing and promotion. On this, his debut
full-length release, Mutlu delivers super slick and super hummable mid-tempo
soulful pop that is extremely hummable and accessible. Mutlu has a great
voice that really makes his tunes cook. The album features several guests
artists including <B>Daryl Hall</B>, <B>Amos Lee</B>, <B>Raheem Devaughn</B>,
<B>Sharon Little</B>, <B>Mercedes Martinez</B>, <B>Steve Holley</B>, and
<B>Greg Bieck</B>...all of whom provide credible support. The only guest
artist who would have been better left off is <B>G. Love</B> who (c)rap
hops on the tune &quot;Shaky Ground&quot; and ruins it. Considering how
smooth and memorable the remaining nine tracks on this disc are, this one
annoying track is like hitting a bad spot in the road. In order to enjoy
this album, we would recommend burning a copy <I>without</I> this tune.
Mutlu is bound to create quite a buzz with this album. The songs are thoughtful
yet light and smooth...just the sort of music that most folks probably need
in the twenty-first century to try and escape the current shape of things.
Cool cuts include &quot;See What It Brings,&quot; &quot;Marilyn,&quot; &quot;Mam's
Not Coming Home,&quot; and &quot;In Your Heart.&quot; (Rating: 4++++)<BR>

We have heard many sparse and simple artists over the past few decades...but
rarely have we heard an artist as stark and naked as Atlanta, Georgia's
<B>Nerdkween</B>. Whereas nowadays in the twenty-first century the usual

that is somehow distant yet profound. Some of the songs on this album are
truly beautiful and have real staying power. In today's semi-generic world,
Nerdkween comes across like a breath of fresh air. Top picks: &quot;3 Haiku,&quot;

<B>Rohin Khemani</B>, and <B>Greg Ritchie</B>. We initially guessed that
after spinning these CDs a few times we would end up having a strong preference
for one disc or the other...but this was not the case. Each has its own
strengths and they both hold up equally well. Adam's precise saxophone playing
drives the proceedings...but the supporting players play a pivotal role
in fleshing out the sound. Overall these recordings sound like modern jazz
that is highly influenced by early classic jazz artists from the 1950s and
1960s. As is always the case with Innova Recordings' releases...the sound
quality is <I>impeccable</I>. These discs are packaged in a beautifully
designed digipak sleeve. Impressive artsy stuff. Recommended. (Rating: 5++)<BR>

If you aren't familiar with this band, you might very easily mistake <I>Huffin'
Rag Blues</I> for what it appears to be on the surface...a collection of
good time party dance music. But if you're even remotely familiar with <B>Nurse
With Wound</B>...well then, you most certainly know <I>better</I>. Whatever
it is or it isn't, <I>Blues</I> is definitely somewhat of a surprise. On
this album, <B>Steven Stapleton</B> and <B>Andrew Liles</B> combine sounds
and styles in such a way that the listener is left feeling slightly confused
and decidedly dizzy. The photos on the digipak sleeve seem to sum up the
sound best...on the surface things appear normal but the closer you pay
attention the stranger they become. And that just may be the underlying
message here. <I>Huffin' Rag Blues</I> can almost (at times) make you tap
your toesies...but the rest of the time you may feel as if you have somehow
gotten lost and can't find your way home. We can't explain it any better
than that, sorry to say... But, as usual, we are mighty impressed with the
intense creativity that is inherent in <I>all</I> Nurse With Wound recordings.
As such, this one easily gets a total thumbs up. It's not for everyone but
then...it doesn't even begin to <I>try</I> to be... Highly recommended.

<B>Orso</B> began releasing music in 1998 and was created by <B>Phil Spirito</B>

and evolving entity that changes depending on the Spirito's needs and desires.

with various musicians participating...which may explain the unpredictable
nature of these recordings. In some ways, the overall sound of this album
occasionally reminds us of <B>Sparklehorse</B>...but the vocals are markedly
different. It is somewhat difficult describing these odd subtle progressive
tracks...but they are extremely laidback and relaxing. Intriguing songs

With most albums, you can kinda guess what's gonna come next after you hear
the first couple of tracks. With <B>Pet Ghost Project</B>...you really never
know exactly <I>what</I> to expect. This band is the solo project created
by <B>Justin Stivers</B> and <I>Cheer Up-It's Raining</I> is his third full-length
release. The mini-bio that accompanied this CD caught out attention mainly
because it described Stivers as a &quot;songer sing writer&quot; (<I>hyuk
hyuk hyuk...</I>). So...exactly what does Pet Ghost Project sound like?
Hard so say, actually...but the odd, spontaneous sound of the songs reminds
us in many ways of some of the more unusual progressive pop bands from Athens,
Georgia in the late 1990s. There is something slightly dream-like about
Justin's recordings. After you hear them, you almost don't remember what
it is that you've just heard. There's some real, credible creativity going
on here...as is evidenced by smart cuts like &quot;Celebrate Youth,&quot;
&quot;Mistakes,&quot; &quot;Kiwi Perfume,&quot; and &quot;Another.&quot;
Intriguing. (Rating: 5)<BR>

<B><A HREF="http://www.vanguardrecords.com/">Vanguard</A></B>, Pop)<BR>
After spinning this album a dozen times or more, we began to try and determine
exactly <I>what it is</I> about this album that is so appealing. After all,
<B>Luke Reynolds</B> (the man behind the band) is just writing and recording
basic pop music...so why is <I>his</I> music is so much better than most
generic twenty-first century pop? Is it because of the stripped down arrangements?
So many artists overproduce their music to death, perhaps that is what makes
this album stand out. Nope, that's not it exactly. Is it because Reynolds
has a really cool deep voice that comes across sounding genuine and inspired?
No, even though he has an incredible voice...that's not what makes this
music so magical. After thinking and thinking we finally came to the conclusion...that
<I>Pictures and Sound</I> is a great album simply because Luke writes <I>really
great</I> pop songs. And the amazing part...is that his music could easily
appeal to millions upon millions of listeners. It is a rare case indeed
when an artist can juggle commercial accessibility with artistic integrity.
But this guy does it...and he makes it all sound <I>as easy as holy hell</I>.
Recorded live to analog tape, <I>Pictures and Sound</I> is a warm and inviting
album that should please just about anyone who loves good, hummable, mid-tempo
pop. The more we hear this...the more impressed we are. Cool catchy cuts
include &quot;Everything Leaves A Mark,&quot; &quot;It's You&quot; (this
one oughta be a major hit!), &quot;Big Screen,&quot; and &quot;Space Between

The lead track on this album (&quot;Captains of Industry&quot;) makes it
instantly clear that the folks in <B>QuarterAcreLifestyle</B> aren't playing
the game by the normal set of rules. After all, how many modern pop bands
begin their album with a peculiar <I>instrumental</I>...? This band is a
rather intriguing quintet with a peculiar and unpredictable sound. The band
consists of <B>Aaron Pollock</B>, <B>Cameron Pollock</B>, <B>Tony Masterantonio</B>,
<B>Kristen Brown</B>, and <B>Sarah Anderson</B>. If we had to try to describe
the overall vibe of this album...we would describe this band's music is
a progressive blend of modern progressive pop with slight strains of industrial
technology. But that might be a bit limiting, as some of the tunes on this
album definitely <I>do not fit</I> within the confines of such a narrowly-defined
framework. What is perhaps most surprising...is how accessible some of these
tracks are. Some of them actually sound like they could be...big commercial
hits (?!?). Odd modern pop cuts include &quot;Yeah Nah,&quot; &quot;Cold
Heart,&quot; &quot;Escalator,&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Lawn.&quot; (Rating:

We are confused. We cannot figure out exactly why it is that <B>Kristoffer

it's not like he is recording obtuse noise or anything. This guy writes
and records accessible catchy pop music that could easily be absorbed by
just about anyone. Our only guess...is that at this point the market is
so oversaturated that thousands upon thousands of credible artists just
get lost in the shuffle. No matter. <I>Wrong Side of the Room</I> is yet
another great little album full of upbeat catchy tunes from this super talented
young fellow. Ragnstam's main emphasis is on lyrics and vocal melodies...but
he also has a great knack for coming up with cool and intricate arrangements.
And man, <I>what a voice</I>. This guy has a falsetto that puts others to
shame. At times we can hear possible traces and/or influences of other artists
like <B>The Kinks</B> and <B>Self</B> in Kristoffer's music...but he is
by no means playing a copycat role in music. This guy's music is original
and unique. Twelve classy cuts here including &quot;Stop On Top,&quot; &quot;Swing

Plain hard rock played straight up with no fillers or additives. <B>The
Revisionists</B> were formed from the ashes of the 1990s grunge band <B>Tonic</B>.
On this, the band's self-titled album, they go straight for the gut...concentrating

This self-titled album rocks hard...and features wonderfully thick and rich
guitars as well as gutsy masculine vocals. The Revisionists are <B>Sam Jones</B>
(guitar, vocals), <B>Dan Lavery</B> (bass), and <B>Kevin Shephard</B> (drums).
This album features a string of non-stop catchy tunes that are bound to
please even the most jaded hard rock fans. The playing is tight and focused...making
it nearly impossible to stay still while spinning the disc. Ten kickass
cuts including &quot;Universal,&quot; &quot;See You Around,&quot; &quot;Monday,&quot;

- <I>Bubble and Scrape Deluxe Edition</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.dominorecordco.com/">Domino</A></B>,
Pop/rock)<BR>
<I>Bubble and Scrape</I> is an important album in the <B>Sebadoh</B> catalog
for a variety of reasons. The album was recorded as the line-up began to
crumble and evolve as this was the last album that included original member
<B>Eric Gaffney</B>. At this point in time this album made it even more
obvious that <B>Lou Barlow</B> was the real magnetic force behind the band's
best tunes. &quot;Soul and Fire,&quot; the lead track, is easily one of
the best pop songs ever written...and yet Barlow's vocals are so subtle
and matter-of-fact that you almost forget what a timeless tune this is.
The variety of the style of music becomes more intense as well, as Gaffney
and <B>Jason Loewenstein</B>'s songs seem increasingly offbeat and intense
compared to Barlow's more conventional pop leanings. As has been the case
with all of Domino's Sebadoh reissues, this is not a mere re-release. The
CD includes a wealth of bonus tracks as well as a deluxe thick booklet detailing
all kinds of Sebadoh facts and information. It's great that this label is
making these albums available once again to a continually growing segment
of the population with a keen interest in Lou Barlow's early recordings...

Although their overall approach is much more varied and encompassing than
either, we would have to placed <B>The Shys</B> in the same general category
as bands like <B>The Strokes</B> and <B>Black Rebel Motorcycle Club</B>.
The guys in this band released their initial EP on Aeronaut before releasing
their debut full-length Astoria on Sire. Thankfully they made the right
choice to dump Sire and return to their original label. The humorously-titled
<I>You'll Never Understand This Band The Way That I Do</I> is chock full
of catchy loud pop/rockers that oughta drive young adults absolutely wild.
The more we hear lead <B>Kyle Kroneo</B> sing...the crazier we are about
his voice. But this is by no means a one man band...all the players are
integral to the overall sound. <B>Alex Kweskin</B>, <B>Chris Wulff</B>,
<B>Riley Stephenson</B>, <B>Tony Cupito</B>, and Kroneo all contribute in
the songwriting department...and all five are super tight on their respective
instruments. The more we spin this album...the more embedded it becomes
in our subconsciousness. Killer classic cuts include &quot;Spanish Village
by the Sea,&quot; &quot;She's Already Gone,&quot; &quot;Find Some Courage,&quot;

We have come to really admire Language of Stone releases over the past couple
of years...and this album is an excellent example of why this is so. Though
they reside in Brooklyn, New York, the folks in <B>Silver Summit</B> write
and record music that recalls some of the more abstract underground progressive
British artists from the 1970s. The band is driven by the dual songwriting
skills of <B>Sondra Sun-Odeon</B> and <B>David Shawn Bosler</B>...both of
whom compose tunes that are decidedly out-of-synch with the majority of
what one hears on the radio and the internet. The songs on this album come
across sounding like folk songs from the past adapted into the world of
the twenty-first century using instruments from another time period. Produced
by <B>Greg Weeks</B> and the band members themselves, this is a richly rewarding
collection of tunes that treads in strange heady territory. Far too intellectual
for the casual listener...this will most likely appeal to folks looking
for those odd unique tidbits floating beneath the surface. Top picks: &quot;Music
in the Afterlife,&quot; &quot;Awaken,&quot; &quot;In-Between Place&quot;

two...as well as similarities between Maggie and <B>Janis Joplin</B>. This
live performance only features five tunes...but the band members use their
time wisely and really flex their muscles on these tracks. Bell's voice
sounds particularly strong and focused. The DVD features the band playing
live in 1973 on the German <I>In Concert, Beat Workshop</I> television show

Georgia's Blossoming Noise label. <B>Sudden Infant</B> is the trio consisting

first track on this album (&quot;Somniphobia&quot;) almost had us believing

is difficult to digest as well as describe. The band's atonal blasts of
intense aural energy are confusing and may cause many folks to have unexpected

We had to spin this album several times before deciding how we felt about
it which is usually a good thing...because with most CDs we can usually
sum them up on the very first spin. At first we figured the guys in <B>The
Suicide Kings</B> were just another alternative country band. But closer
inspection revealed something more different and substantial. Although the
songs on the band's self-titled album might be lumped into the increasingly-annoying
alternative country category, this band's overall sound has much more variety
than such a simple categorization might imply. Some of the tracks on this
album sound like classic country music...others sound like honky tonk...while
still others teeter into the world of rock and roll. This debut album features
a surprisingly mature sound. But that may be due to the fact that bandleaders
<B>Bruce Cannole</B> and <B>Brad Buxer</B> have been playing together for
over 20 years (they were originally in the bands <B>The Jetzons</B> and
<B>The Strand</B>). These guys have obviously paid their dues. And now,
if the timing is right, this album is gonna catch a lot of people off guard.
Songs are what make an album great...and there are twelve truly great tracks
here. Cool hummable cuts include &quot;Suicide King,&quot; &quot;Marie,&quot;
&quot;Hooker's Lament,&quot; &quot;I Want To Live Forever,&quot; and &quot;Thoughts

album on which the band uses a standard line-up of bass, drums, and guitars
to present their decidedly unpretentious and totally delicious upbeat pop
tunes. The band consists of <B>Jacques Dubois</B> (drums), <B>Eric Van Buren</B>
(bass), and <B>Rejean Ricard</B> (guitar). Ricard is a master songwriter...this
time tossing out fourteen fresh new killer tracks that stick in the mind
like glue. Interestingly, this time around many of the songs recall <B>The
Jam</B> at the point when <B>Paul Weller</B> began toning down the volume
a bit, opting to focus more on melodies and arrangements. The Telepathic
Butterflies are one of the most genuine and credible guitar pop bands on
the planet. Instead of following trends and selling out, they focus on creating
purely entertaining music for discriminating listeners. Killer cuts include
&quot;The Trouble in Keeping Up With the Joneses,&quot; &quot;Telescope,&quot;
&quot;Sign of the Times,&quot; and &quot;The Caution Slumber.&quot; Warning:
This stuff is as <I>catchy as holy hell</I>. Recommended. (Rating: 5++)<BR>

- <I>A Celebration of Marc &amp; Mickey</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.angelair.co.uk/">Angel
Air</A></B>, Pop/rock)<BR>
We approached this disc with some serious reservations. <B>T. Rex</B> is
one of the most criminally re-packaged and re-marketed bands <I>in history</I>.
And because we are such avid fans of the late great <B>Marc Bolan</B>...we
figured these recordings would be miserable failures. After all, this isn't
the real band here...but rather a re-grouped version of the band in the
1990s that features only one original member...<B>Mickey Finn</B> (these
songs were recorded shortly before Finn's untimely death). When we slammed
this sucker into our player we had to do a double take. What is this...old
tracks of Bolan singing layered over new musical tracks...? Nope, that is
not the case. As hard as it is to believe, the man singing on this album
is not Marc Bolan. Rather and instead, the shockingly-similar voice belongs
to <B>Paul Fenton</B>...a man who sounds <I>so much like Bolan</I> that
you have to hear it to believe it. This is a confusing album for many reasons.
Fenton, Finn, and their associates do an impressive job of recreating the
T. Rex sound. But just as you might imagine, the original recordings remain
superior. This is an interesting look back and, for many fans, a way of
re-living one of the coolest careers in music that is now, sadly, only a
memory. One thing is certain. Fenton has <I>perfected</I> his imitation
of Bolan's voice (!!!). (Not Rated)</FONT></P>

Tut</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>Everything</I> (Independently released
CD, Pop/rock)<BR>
Exceptionally cool and groovy pop/rock from New York's <B>Corey Tut</B>.
On the first spin, you might be inclined to dismiss this album as just another
of millions of buzzsaw pop albums currently splattered all over the planet.
But after taking the time to spin <I>Everything</I> half a dozen times...we
found that we were indeed hooked on this man's brand of smart, super hummable
pop. In the cover letter that accompanied this disc Tut compares his music
to artists like <B>Foo Fighters</B> and <B>Daughtry</B>...but his own music
is, in fact, far superior to either. This album has a nice, dense, thick
sound courtesy of producer <B>Super Buddha</B>...who has also produced <B>Deborah
Harry</B> and <B>Rufus Wainwright</B>. But the songs themselves are what
make this album such a cool addictive spin. Many of Corey's tunes are apparently
fueled by by problems and/or disagreements with ex-friends, ex-lovers, and
ex-business associates. Funny how anger and resentment seem to be such excellent
fuel for creativity. Tut may be an underground artist now...but if he gets
the right exposure in the coming months this guy could easily become a <I>huge</I>
superstar. Cool catchy cuts include &quot;Someone Else's Problem,&quot;
&quot;Wasted,&quot; &quot;So What?&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Memory,&quot;
and &quot;Not Leaving.&quot; (Rating: 5+)<BR>

- <I>A Very Fine Adventure</I> (CD, <B>Twink Tunes</B>, Instrumental)<BR>
Who would've thought that when the strange sounds of <B>Pianosaurus</B>
trickled into people's consciousness in the 1980s...that the toy instrument
genre would not only survive, but <I>thrive</I>...? Strange but true. And
now here in the twenty-first century, <B>Mike Langlie</B>'s <B>Twink</B>
seems to be leading the pack. Langlie has made a career out of tinkering
with toys. His albums are always fanciful and humorous yet they are so focused
and precise that they are not merely a joke...but rather a way of taking
&quot;toy music&quot; seriously to a higher plane of existence. <I>A Very
Fine Adventure</I> is quite possibly the most accessible Twink album yet...but
most folks probably won't think so. This time around Mike creates music
that sounds something like the soundtrack to a film...which might almost
sound normal if it weren't for those ever-so-slightly off key toy instruments
clattering and tinkling around in the foreground. This release features
absolutely fantastic graphics on a foldout cardboard sleeve...three cuddly
little bunnies taking off into the sky in a hot air balloon. Langlie has
an extremely loyal and devoted underground following and yet...he remains
a curious oddity in the world that most folks are completely unfamiliar
with. Such a shame...why is it that the <I>most creative people</I> always
seem to exist on the fringes...? Never mind and no matter...because those
who experience the eloquence of <I>A Very Fine Adventure</I> will reap plenty
of truly fine goddamn rewards. Simultaneously smart and silly mind altering
tracks include &quot;Bunnies in a Balloon,&quot; &quot;Blindfolded Bird
Race,&quot; &quot;Toadstool Tea,&quot; and &quot;The Voyage Home.&quot;
Intelligent music for the thinking adult who hasn't yet lost his/her ability
to &quot;just be a kid.&quot; Highly recommended. (Rating: 5+++)<BR>

Waddle</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>Piece by Piece</I> (Independently
released CD, Pop)<BR>
Smooth, hummable, accessible soft melodic pop that recalls FM radio pop
from the 1970s and 1980s. What will probably grab most folks' attention
first about this album is the fact that <B>Reed Waddle</B> recorded and
co-wrote some of this album with <B>John Oates</B> (of <B>Hall &amp; Oates</B>)
at his home studio in Woody Creek, Colorado. Not surprising, as Reed's music
has the same kind of plaintive, soulful sound of the well-known 1970s duo.
<I>Piece by Piece</I> is a super slick album with a thick sound that will
seem instantly familiar to most music fans. Waddle isn't playing the game
like the average up-and-coming obscure musician. Rather than starting out
creating super weird or super strange sounding stuff...he opted instead
to charge out of the gates writing and recording music that could be appreciated
by millions. After spinning this disc a few times...we can't help but think
that, with the right backing, this guy could become hugely famous in no
time. He has an incredibly smooth voice...and his songs are bound to strike
a chord with people. Smooth R &amp; B pop cuts include &quot;The Beast Within,&quot;
&quot;Piece By Piece,&quot; &quot;Natural Elevation,&quot; and &quot;Velveteen
Skies.&quot; (Rating: 5)<BR>

Walker</A></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> - <I>With You</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.dorado.net/">Dorodo
Records Limited</A></B>, Pop)<BR>
Plenty of nice, smooth, pensive, understated melodic pop abounds on <B>Natalie
Walker</B>'s second full-length release. Like her debut, <I>With You</I>
was produced by the duo <B>Stuhr</B>. Walker writes smooth accessible soft
pop songs that seem to breathe new life due to the nice, thick, organic
sounding electronics that bleed in and out of the mix. The rhythms are slow
but persistent...and Natalie has a voice that can truly melt mountains.
This might be considered lite groove music...because when listening to it
you may very well have the inclination to calmly sway back and forth. This
is probably too smooth and easy for rock and rollers and/or folks seeking
something really far out. But Walker's music is certain to please the audience
she is aiming for. Her songs are articulate and moving...and manage to create
a really cool upbeat mood. In a perfect world, <I>With You</I> would be
hugely popular. But considering the weird ups and downs of twenty-first
century music...well, we'll just have to wait and see what happens. She's
certainly got the songs and the voice to make some major waves. Twelve kickass
tunes here including &quot;Lost My Shadow,&quot; &quot;Over and Under,&quot;
and &quot;Only Love.&quot; Really beautiful music. Recommended. (Rating:

- <I>Original Motion Picture Soundtrack: Music by <B>Danny Elfman</B></I>
(CD, <B>Lakeshore</B>, Soundtrack)<BR>
A simple fact to bear in mind in the world of soundtrack recordings...if
it has the name <B>Danny Elfman</B> on it, it <I>has</I> to be good. The
<I>Wanted</I> soundtrack is a bit of a departure for Elfman in some ways.
The disc begins with a normal pop/rock song (&quot;The Little Things&quot;)
that sets the mood for the film before Elfman returns to his signature big
orchestral sound. And speaking of big orchestras... The inner insert includes
the names of all the individuals who participated in the creation of this
project and the list is big, big, <I>BIG</I>. Instruments involved include
a <I>huge</I> violin section, multiple violas and cellos, six bass players...in
addition to flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, french horns, trumpets,
trombones, tuba, various percussion, and even a harp. This is a big production
that was obviously used to match what will obviously be a high-tech adrenaline-fueled
film. This time around Elfman has created a soundtrack that is exciting
and curious...and will no doubt sound totally <I>fantastic</I> on a big
sound system. We have loved every soundtrack this man has yet to create...and
<I>Wanted</I> is no exception. Magnificent stuff... (Rating: 5+)<BR>

Folk/pop)<BR>
<B>Tamas Wells</B> is one of the most genuinely talented folkie popsters
we have heard this century. His organic free flowing melodies are smooth
and soothing...ultimately uplifting and thought provoking. <I>Two Years
in April</I> is cut from the same fabric as Well's last album and features
ten precisely focused tracks. We can't help but continue to compare Tamas'
voice to the voice of the late great<B> Kirsty MacColl</B>...as both artists
have a similar timbre and their phrasing can be almost identical at times.
<I>Two Years in April</I> is a lovely album featuring smart, honest songs
that come straight from the heart. Although he has had success in his native
Australia as well as even bigger success in Japan...Wells still remains
a curious unknown in the United States. Sad...but yet another example of
how some of the best artists in the world hardly receive any recognition
at all in America. Most folks in this depressing country are much more concerned
with trendy fashion and temporary pop than they are with credible genuine
artists. No matter. In the end folks like Tamas Wells will win...because
they create credible music that will stand the test of time. Keen reflective
songs include &quot;Fine, Don't Follow A Tiny Boat For A Day,&quot; &quot;For
The Aperture,&quot; &quot;Signs I Can't Read,&quot; and &quot;Grace And
Seraphim.&quot; The strings on this album are <I>superb</I>. Highly recommended.

Pop)<BR>
Strange that this album <I>just happened</I> to be sitting on top of the
the new album by <B>From Bubblegum To Sky</B> in our office stacks...because
<B>Adrian Whitehead</B>'s voice and style of crafting songs are remarkably
similar to <B>Mario Hernandez</B>. Like Hernandez, Whitehead writes melodic
uplifting music that is so positive and upbeat that it is likely to turn
lots of folks <I>off</I>. Which is truly unfortunate...because these songs
are by no means artificially calculated nor phony. <I>One Small Stepping
Man</I> is a purely genuine collection of catchy positive pop that resounds
with originality. We had to spin this album over and over and over before
it finally made an impression on us. But when it hit...it <I>really</I>
hit. This guy is good at what he does...<I>damn</I> good. The 1960s leap
into the twenty-first century...and the results are astounding. Classic
cuts include &quot;Caitlin's 60's Pop Song,&quot; &quot;You Are The Sun,&quot;
&quot;Elle,&quot; and &quot;Nothing's Changed.&quot; Some of these tunes
recall some of the softer tracks by <B>The Monkees</B> and the vocals are
strangely reminiscent of <B>Redd Kross</B> at times... Recommended. (Rating:

 SIZE=+1> - <I>Rebel Road</I> (Advance CD-R, <B>Airline</B>, Rock/pop)<BR>
We had to do a double take when this little sucker slid out of the envelope.
A new album by...<B>Edgar Winter</B>...? Truth is stranger than fiction...and
yes, the 1970s albino/transvestite rocker has recorded and released a brand
new batch of tunes. Winter was pretty much a two hit wonder as most folks
are only familiar with his two mega-hits &quot;Free Ride&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;
Most artists making a comeback would return with a super slick box of processed
cheese...but Edgar Winter doesn't take the standard approach. <I>Rebel Road</I>
is surprisingly raunchy...and rocks pretty damned hard. The guitars are
loud and up front in the mix...and Edgar's vocals are impressively gritty
and masculine. We would have liked to have seen the actual complete release
on this one rather than an advance CD-R. As such, this one <I>definitely</I>
gets a thumbs up...but only a partial review because we received only part
of the actual final product... (Not Rated)</FONT></P>

 SIZE=+1> - <I>Object 47</I> (CD, <B><A HREF="http://www.cargorecords.co.uk/">Cargo
UK</A></B>, Pop/rock)<BR>
Earlier this year the guys in Wire surprised a lot of folks with their totally
inspired <I>Read and Burn 03</I> EP. The disc represented a well-timed return
to form...and was probably the result of the band revisiting their past
catalog. Now comes the highly anticipated follow up full-length...<I>Object
47</I>. Just as was the case with <I>Read and Burn 03</I>, this album finds
the band treading in territory that is similar to their very early recordings
decades ago. But instead of sounding like a rehash of old ideas these songs
sound fresh and genuinely spirited. Most bands that have been around as
long as Wire have either sold out or have burned out in a blaze of waste
and desperation. <I>Object 47</I> is basically a progressive pop album with
threads of subtle psychedelia. These nine songs sound better and better
the more familiar they become. Listeners should be aware of the fact that
none of the songs on <I>Read and Burn</I> are repeated here...so seeking
out both discs would definitely be in order. One of the best things about
2008...is that we are once again reminded of what a great band Wire is.
Killer cuts include &quot;One Of Us,&quot; &quot;Four Long Years,&quot;
&quot;Patient Flees,&quot; &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; (a particularly satisfying
track), and &quot;All Fours.&quot; Recommended. (Rating: 5+++)<BR>

released CD, Rock/pop)<BR>
Cool, catchy, upbeat pop/rock played with plenty of genuine inspiration.
The press released that accompanied this disc compared <B>The Yell</B> to
<B>The Kinks</B> and <B>The Who</B>...but in our minds this Washington,
D.C. trio sounds even more like a modern updated American take on <B>The
Jam</B>. The songs on <I>A Real Fine Hole</I> feature big fat fuzzy guitars,
throbbing danceable rhythms, and nice clean vocals. These tunes are so catchy
and upbeat that it didn't dawn on us until several spins later...that the
lyrics are the only weak link. This band writes some incredible pop songs.
If they can come up with lyrics to match the intensity of their music...they
will most surely have a totally winning combination. Even taken as is, <I>Hole</I>
is a great big fall of power pop fun that doesn't require anything more
than simply turning it up and letting 'er rip. Top picks: &quot;Buried Standing
Up,&quot; &quot;We're History Now,&quot; and &quot;Gonna.&quot; (Rating:
