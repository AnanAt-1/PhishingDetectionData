<P>	"So you're Lou Lehmann?  One my descendants, are you?  And you want to poke around to
see what you can find out about my life and the lives of my kinfolk.  Hoping that your children or
grandchildren might care about such things?  Well, none of you are going to learn much about our
lives just by listening to me or to any other ancestral ghosts.  You'd have to go through what we went
through.   Think any of you would be up to it?  Could you work even half as hard as we did?   Could
you load up a family of eleven onto an oxcart and move them hundreds of miles out of
Massachusetts and into New York?  Could you make your own furniture?  Could you even survive
in a wilderness where you don't know where your next meal is coming from?  Could you trust your
neighbors to pitch in and help you when you need them?</P>

<P>	No you couldn't.  You couldn't begin to do what I and your Willis ancestors and their kin
had to do.  We had none of that so-called 'technology.'   We didn't sit on our butts for hours every
day in front of a  computer.  We used washboards instead of those fancy machines that wash your
dishes in clothes.  We had carriages with horses instead of motors.   We got by without those big
carriages that fly through the sky.  We worked hard but we enjoyed just being with family and
friends because we didn't have those silly  boxes that  hypnotize you with sounds and pictures.  We
used candles and lamps instead of pushing a button or flipping a switch..   We didn't have  wires that
let you talk to people far away so  we wrote letters.   Now don't tell me how all that stuff gets things
done faster and easier.  I can see that but I also see how it muddles your life with confusion.  And
for all those inventions around you, do you think your world is safer than the one I lived in?  I don't. 
You live in a very different world and at a very different time.    So you're not going to understand
my life just by listening to what I tell you.</P>


<P>	But don't fret.  I'm going to talk with you anyway about what you've learned from your
Willis ancestors and from other ancestral relatives.   Why?   Because you are family, no matter how
muddled you may be.   And just maybe you can learn a few things about life from us ancestral spirits
that you can't learn from all that stuff in your world.   Yes, I've found out a lot about many of your
ancestors from their ghosts during the 129 years since my death.   So let's start taking a look at some
of those who have populated your family tree.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 16pt">ANCESTORS IN THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR </SPAN> </P>


<P>	"First of all, Lou Lehmann, let's get a few things straight.   It's thanks to your great-grandfather, Henry Ewing, that you even  have any Willis ancestors.   Henry  married my grand-daughter, Augusta Willis, in 1855.  I'll have more to say about that later but right now we'll start by
looking at what you've discovered about the lives of some of your earliest American  ancestors.  </P>


<P>	You found that most of your Willis ancestors lived in Massachusetts before I moved my his
family to New York in 1819.  Then  it didn't take you long to find out that my name was spelled in
different ways at different times - Willis, Willys, Wyllys, Wyllis.  The earliest Willis  you found was
John Willis whom you guessed came to America from England around 1635-37.  But nobody knows
that for sure.<A HREF="#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	 Anyway you do know that he held some town offices in Massachusetts  at Duxbury in 1637
and at Bridgewater in 1650, and that he was listed in 1643 as "one of those from Duxborrow - able
to bear arms. <A HREF="#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Sometimes he was a juror.  Once he was a juror during a   murder trial in 1648. 
Alice Bishop was hanged after being found guilty of killing her daughter, Martha Clarke.  Part of the
coroner's report gave you some idea of how gruesome it must have been for John Willis and the
other jurors to hear.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	".........coming into the house of the said Richard Bishop, wee saw at the foot of a lader which
leadeth into an upper chamber, much blood; and going up all of us into the chamber, wee found a
woman child, of about foure yeares of age, lying in her shifte uppon her left cheeke, with her throat
cut with divers gashes crose wayes, the wind pipe cut and suke into the throat downward, and a
bloody knife lyin to the side of the child, with which knife all of us judge, and the said Allis hath
confessed to five of us, att one time, that shee murdered the child with the said knife." <EM> </EM><A HREF="#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>



<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You wondered how sick John Willis might have felt when he heard that and you guessed that
he was probably very glad to get home to his wife and children after that trial.  His wife?   You
learned that she was Elizabeth Hodgekin,  that she married John in 1637, and that they had eight
children - John, Nathaniel, Joseph, Comfort, Benjamin, Hannah, Elizabeth, and Sarah.  , one of
whom was your ancestor, Joseph Willis.  But there's been more written about Comfort Willis than
the others.  He was a soldier in that ugly war with that Indian they called "King Phillip."  All right,
all right.  I can guess what's going on in your head.  You're remembering that his real name was
Metacomet and that he suspected the Plymouth people of poisoning his brother.   And you've read
how the Indians resented the ways that the colonists used the land.  Well, whatever caused the war,
John Willis's family  was right in the middle of it.  It's said that Comfort Willis  penned a  note
about the war in 1676.  The first part of that note says that John Willis (or maybe his son  - same
name) was one of those who first saw some approaching Indians before turning to Comfort Willis
for help.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"On Saturday Capt  Hayward, Sgt Packard, John Willis and Isaac Harris went out to see if
the Indians were coming down upon them and they saw an Indian which made them think the enemy
was at hand, and they immediately impressed Comfort Willis and Joseph Edson to go post to the
Governor the same day at night to tell him of it.  And he went to Plymouth with them next day to
send Capt. Church with his company.  And Captain Church went with his company to Monopauset
[ a large pond in Halifax] on the Sabbath and came no further that day, and he told them he would
meet them next day." <A HREF="#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The rest of that note talks about how Comfort and some of his friends went out to fight the
Indians - without any help from Captain Benjamin Church who is so famous as an Indian fighter.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"...... And Comfort Willis and Joseph Edson came home at night and told their friends of it,
and Ensign Haward, Samuel Edson, Josiah Edson, Joseph Edson, John Washburn, Samuel
Washburn, Thomas Washburn, John Field, Nicholas Byram, Samuel Allen, Samuel Allen, Jun. John
Gordon, John Haward, John Packard, John Ames, Comfort Willis, Guido Bailey, Nathaniel
Hayward, John Whitman, John Hayward, and Samuel Leach, went out on Monday, supposing to
meet with Capt. Church; but they came upon the enemy and fought with them and took seventeen
of them alive and also much plunder. And they all returned, and not one of them fell by the enemy
; and received no help from Church."  <A HREF="#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	So what do you think of Comfort Willis and his friends out there fighting Indians without
your famous Captain Benjamin Church?  Oh yes, I know all about how that Captain Church was a
brother to one of your other ancestors, Joseph Church. And how their father, Richard Church,
married Elizabeth Warren, daughter of Richard Warren, one of the Mayflower passengers.  Well,
maybe the great Captain  Benjamin Church was a Mayflower descendant and an Indian fighter but
it seems to me that Comfort Willis and his men fought the Indians just fine without him.  Ah, I know
what you're thinking, Louis.   About how the whites mistreated the Indians.  People have been
arguing about that for hundreds of years.   But there's always two sides to every argument and there
were plenty of killings done by both the whites and the Indians.   And whatever you think of those
Indian wars, they were a part of the life faced by the early Willises and their neighbors.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You didn't find as much information about your own ancestor, Joseph Willis, as you did
about his brother, Comfort.   But I saw how excited you got when you found out that he married a
Sarah Lincoln in 1670. <A HREF="#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Hah!  You though you might get hooked up in some way with the family
of Abraham Lincoln.  And you tried every way you could to find a connection.   But no such luck
for you.   Finally you had to admit that there was no link.   Serves you right, Louis.  You're not
always going to be finding famous people in your family lines.  Nor should you.   You can learn a
lot from plain folks like me and others in your Willis lines.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Take Joseph Willis's son, Jeremiah.  He was one of your ancestors who was just "plain
folks."   He married Rebecca Stimson in 1705 and  they had eight children, including your ancestor,
Seth Willis, who was my grandfather.  Their other children were Jeremiah, Jedidiah, John, Solomon,
Jonathan, Mehitabel, and Rachel.  The older Jeremiah was a blacksmith at Dorchester in 1717.  You
didn't find him doing anything famous but you knew that he was a man who grieved.  Because you
found that when he sold some of his land in 1759, he kept back a part of it where he had buried one
of his children. <A HREF="#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Nothing special about that poor child.   Nobody remembers anything about him - or her.  Was
the child a boy or a girl?  How old?  No one knows.   There is no record.  But just like so many
fathers whose children died during those times, Jeremiah buried the child on his land and mourned. 
 Have you wondered how many other Willises might lie in the ground near that unknown child?  
Maybe even Jeremiah himself?  Just one of the many mysteries in your family history.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	From all your readings, I suppose you know that Jeremiah's first wife, Rebecca Stimson,
apparently died sometime before Oct 4, 1742 because that's when he married his second wife, 
Remember Tupper, the widow of Thomas Tupper.  Before Thomas's death in 1739, he and
Remember   had eight children: Mayhew, Seth, Joanna, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, and Benjamin 
 The best remembered was  Benjamin, best remembered as General Benjamin  Tupper.  Look at the
following account and you will see that Jeremiah Willis's step-son, General Benjamin  Tupper was
not only a hero in the Revolutionary War but was also one of the early citizens of Chesterfield,
Massachusetts where I raised my family before moving them to New York.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"January 8, 1764.  Benjamin Tupper joined the Congregational Church of Easton.  A few
months after this he moved to Chesterfield where he was an active citizen and became the first
deacon of the church.  On the breaking out of the Revolutionary War he was a lieutenant of militia. 
He proceeded at once to Springfield and dispersed the Supreme Court of Crown, then in session
there.  He then marched to Roxbury and was at once made a major in Colonel Fellow's regiment. 
About the middle of July, 1755, he made an expedition with muffled oars to Castle Island, burned
the lighthouse and brought off considerable property though the British fleet was not far off.  The
British endeavored to rebuild the lighthouse but while the work of restoration was in progress, Major
Tupper embarked some men in Whale-boats, taking some field-pieces with them.  They  arrived at
the lighthouse about two o-clock in the morning and attacked the guard, killed the officers and for
privates and captured the rest of the troops.  Having demolished the works they were about to depart
but the tide left them and the Major himself was attacked by the enemy's boats.  But sinking one of
the boats with his field-piece, he escaped with the loss of one man killed and one wounded.  He
killed and captured fifty-three of the enemy; and among the captures were ten Tories who were
immediately sent to Springfield jail.  This brave and successful attack won great praise..  Washington
thanked Major Tupper the next day in general orders.  Jefferson saw in it 'the adventurous genius
and intrepidity of the New Englanders and the British Admiral said that ;no one act of the siege
caused so much chagrin in London as the destruction of the lighthouse and it was the theme of the
most biting sarcasm."  <A HREF="#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	I'm sure you're not surprised that General Benjamin Tupper was one of the leaders in our
little Chesterfield community.  But we had others thee who had been soldiering long before Tupper. 
One of them was my grandfather, Seth Willis.  Ah, there was a man who had more than his share of
glory, shame, and tragedy.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You figured that Seth Willis was born in 1720 when his death notice told you that he was
eighty-seven when he died in 1807. <A HREF="#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  The earliest information you discovered about him was that
he was one of the three thousand Massachusetts soldiers in the 1745 British expedition against
Louisbourg. <A HREF="#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Not knowing anything about Louisbourg, you looked it up and found that it was then
a small fortress town held by the French on the southeast side of Cape Breton Island above Nova
Scotia.  In those days folks said it was one of th strongest forts in the world.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You don't really know what Seth Willis did during that siege but you've wondered if he
might have been one of the four hundred men who set  fire on May 2 to the supplies that the French
had stored in the hills outside of the fort.  Or could he have been one of the soldiers making a
thousand scaling ladders as the British prepared to attack.  Well, whatever he did, you can be  quite
sure that he was a proud man when the French surrendered Louisbourg.  <A HREF="#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	After Louisbourg Seth decided to get married.  You found a record that on May 31, 1746, he
declared his intention of marrying Phoebe Keith.  But then you found another record than on Nov.
22, 1746, he declared his intention to marry Phoebe Keith's widowed  sister, Silence Smith. <A HREF="#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  
Finally you found a record that he married Silence in Easton on Dec. 18, 1746.  <A HREF="#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  You don't know
what to make of all that.           You know that Phoebe went on to marry Daniel White and you know
that Silence was the widow of Benjamin Smith. You are wondering if Benjamin might have died in
1746,  sometime between May 31 and Nov 22, leaving Silence with some children and a need for
a man to be their father.  But you have no evidence.   So for all of your computer records and
microfilms and books, it's still a mystery to you.  Why did  Seth start out intending to marry Phoebe
but ended up marrying her sister?    Did Seth and Phoebe have a falling out?  Was the family so
concerned about Silence as a widow that they might have insisted that Seth marry Silence instead
of Phoebe?   As it is with many other questions about the Willises, you may never know.  But
whatever the reason, Seth and Silence were my grandparents and your ancestors.  And of course
Seth's marriage also made you a descendant of the Scottish  Keith family.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Yes, Seth's wife, Silence, and her sister, Phoebe, were daughters of Josiah Keith, whose 1717
house is still standing in North Easton, Massachusetts.   And of course they were also granddaughters
of Rev. James Keith, the first minister of the church in Bridgewater.   He was preaching there when
Comfort Willis and Benjamin Church were fighting the Indians during King Phillip's war.   People
listened to Rev. Keith, especially in 1676 when King Phillip was killed by Alderman, a Pocasset
Indian who accompanied Benjamin Church in the final hunt for Phillip.  After all the bloodshed by
both side, some people wanted to kill all of the Indian prisoners that had been captured.   Yes, all of
them, including Philip's nine-year old son, Metom.   That's how angry people were.  Ready to
murder children.   But Rev. Keith was one of the few people who spoke out favoring mercy for the
boy.  Well, that might have saved his life and I suppose it was for the best.  But do you wonder if it
was much of a favor when you remember  that the wretched child was then shipped off to the West
Indies  to be sold into slavery.  <A HREF="#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> <A HREF="#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Have you ever wondered if he might have been better off dead?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Disgraceful? Yes, but that's how it was in those days and King Phillip's War wasn't the only
war where disgraceful things happened.  There was plenty of shame to go around in the French and
Indian War.  Especially when General Braddock marched to Fort Duquesne in 1755.  You read all
about that because one of your ancestral uncles was there with Braddock. <A HREF="#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  From your readings you
know how badly that fool Braddock mismanaged that dismal campaign.  His army included George
Washington as well as your ancestral uncle, William Ewing, who is said to have been Braddock's 
adjutant..  That fool Braddock insisted  on organizing his men as if they were on European battlefield
rather than in an American wilderness, making them  sitting ducks for ambush by the French and
Indians.   Yet  he was no coward.  He had  four horses shot out from under him and then died after
falling from the fifth horse.  Washington was luckier.  .  Two horses were killed under him and his
clothes were partly torn from his back by bullets.  And your William Ewing?  Who knows what he
did or didn't do in that battle.  Nobody wrote about him.  But many wrote about how the campaign
was a disaster for the British and the colonials.  Out of their total force of 1373 all but 459 were
killed or wounded.  As for the 86 officers, only 23 of them escaped injury. <A HREF="#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  So far as you know,
William Ewing was one of the lucky twenty-three.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You don't know that any  Willises were at Fort Duquesne but you do know that Seth Willis
was back again as a colonial soldier some years after he was married.  Fighting for another fool -
General Abercrombie.  You found Seth listed as  one of the twenty-four Easton men enlisted on
April 13, 1758 under Captain James Andrews in Colonel Thomas Doty's regiment for service with
Abercrombie's forces at Crown Point or Ticonderoga.  Then when you read the following account
of the battle, you wondered if my grandfather acted in a soldierly way or in a disgraceful manner.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"These troops had part in a most inglorious campaign.  It was not their fault, however.  Before
Fort Carillon, at Ticonderoga, they fought with desperate valor.  But while Montcalm in the
thick of danger cheered on his men and directed the defense in person, the English
Commander Abercrombie skulked out of sight; and after the defeat, though his forces still
outnumbered Montcalm's fourfold, he beat a disgraceful retreat.  We are not therefore
surprised that several of our Easton soldiers deserted.  This was not before, nor was it in face
of, a battle.  They deserted at Half-Moon, then a station and now a town at the junction of the
Hudson and Mohawk rivers.  Lieut. Benjamin Williams was sent after them, who found and
brought them back.  For their punishment, seven shillings were docked from their wages and
given to Lieutenant Williams.  He brought back sixty-four deserters, and received for the
service twenty-two pounds, eight shillings.  Why so light a penalty was inflicted for so grave
a military offence does not appear; either the discipline was very defective, or what is more
probable and pleasanter for us to believe, it was not a case of genuine desertion "  <A HREF="#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	There you have it, Louis.  Was my grandfather, Seth Willis, one of those Easton
soldiers who deserted.  You'd like to think he wasn't but you don't know.  And I'm not going
to tell you.  Keeps you more humble when you don't know everything.  Ah, but when you
read one of the descriptions of that battle, you figured that he was one of the 5900 provincial
soldiers who were with the 6300 British regulars at  Lake George. And this account gave you
some idea of what his life might have been like in that campaign. <A HREF="#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"... These militiamen of course were mostly raw and untrained soldiers, though some
of them had seen service in previous campaigns of the war..... Gambling by soldiers was
frowned on most severely; any man caught in the at was to be given three hundred lashes
without bothering to hold a court martial.... eight hundred bateaux and ninety whaleboats had
been hauled by soldiers on low-wheeled trucks over the portage from the Hudson River to
Lake George.  Various camp activities were ordered while the troops were awaiting word to
launch their boats.  Some regiments turned out to early-morning target practice, while those

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	How do you think my grandfather felt about soldiers being threatened with 300 lashes
for gambling.   Now you're wondering if he gambled.   Once again, I'm not going to tell you. 
But you might well guess that he was one of the soldiers moving those boats because you can
bet that the British regulars would have had the militia men do it.  Whatever weapon Seth had, 
he must have been in one of those 900 boats that went down Lake George on July 5, 1758. 
Now take another look at that account of the battle to see just how stupid Abercrombie was
as a commander</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"Everything collapsed into confusion, some of the troops continuing to advance, while
others returned to the landing place.  Firing broke out toward late afternoon, but there was no
enemy, it was merely ?British firing at other elements of their own forces.  In short, all was
chaos and night fell upon a scared and disorganized army....Daylight restored courage and all
the troops were drawn back to the landing place, moved over to the eastern shore, and the
expedition advanced down the portage road without meeting any opposition.. Abercrombie's
main army camped that night on the open ground... perhaps a mile and a half from the French
defenses... Abercrombie  was misled by a young officer's inaccurate report that the Fre3nch
defenses were weak, scorned to use artillery and ordered a frontal attack by his infantry. 
Abercrombie himself apparently never went within a mile of the log wall (where sharpened
points of trees had been erected to repel attackers)... His sole leadership throughout the entire
action seems to have been merely the ordering of another attack as soon as he learned of the
failure of the previous assault.. The initial British attack was made in the worst possible way,
an uncoordinated attack by several regiments in long lines, three deep  each regiment attacked
in a long thin line as soon as it was ready, regardless of the movements of its neighbor...."</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Abercrombie lost a lot of men, 1610 killed, wounded, and missing.   The French lost
377 out of their four thousands. Yet at the end Abercrombie still had a lot more men than the
French had.   And he still had all his artillery but he was too stupid to use it.  If he had, he
could have smashed down the wall of the fort and another attack might have won the day.   
But that dunce was not up to any more fighting. <A HREF="#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A><EM>   </EM>A sad day for his men.  No wonder some
of the militia men deserted.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Not only did Seth have to suffer under the command of that idiot, Abercrombie, but
he apparently got involved in a bitter dispute with Samuel Blodgett, a sutler who supplied
clothing to the soldiers.  When you heard this, you looked up "sutler" and learned that this

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <A HREF="#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>.   Grandfather's dispute with Blodgett went on for eight years. It was about 1765 when 
Blodgett said that in 1758  he supplied clothing to Seth who refused to pay him.   Blodgett
then sued Seth  but didn't appear at the trial where Seth said he never had the good, never
gave any receipt, and said he could not write.  When the court  favored Seth .  Blodgett's
attorney appealed the decision but once again didn't appear at the trial so the court again
favored Grandfather. </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	That wasn't the end of it.  Blodgett pleaded for a new trial, insisting   that he was  told
after the trial that the Jury acted upon a "gross mistake" described as "The paper on the
backside of which the sd Willis had  given his receit aforesd imparted an Order (from the sd
Willis's Capn for the value of the particulars recd ) upon your Petr and that order was not
signed &amp; that fact together with the sd Willis's affirming he never signd the Receipt nor ever
recd anything from your Petr who was presented to the Court as a Cheat and Willis declaring
Blodgett had refused to swear to his Account when Willis offerd to pay him, if he would
swear the receipt was just.  The jury quite misunderstood the Case by reason your Petr was
absent and could not explain the affair nor confront the sd Willis and so they considered your
Petr to be a bad man &amp; gave the case against him so that your Petr has greatly sufferd in his
good name &amp; caracter as well as the loss of a most Just Debt with large costs &amp; charges...".</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	That stubborn Blodgett wasted eight years trying to get  38 shillings from Seth Willis. 
Seems he was  more concerned about his reputation than the money.  I don't know why he
bothered about that because he was a rich man by 1766.  He had a successful store, did some
lumber business, bought some land, built a saw-mill, and owned a farm. <A HREF="#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>   Much later he got
to be a judge up in New Hampshire. He even raised a cargo from a sunken ship in 1783, using
some contraption that he invented.  Then he went to England to try it but it didn't work.  By
1793 he was in New Hampshire  where he spent a lot of money building a canal.   Then he
had money problems and for a while was jailed because of debts.  Maybe that served him right
after eight years of  bothering my grandfather. </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Anyway Louis, don't think that Seth Willis and William Ewing were your only
ancestral relatives serving in the French and Indian War.  My father-in-law, Amariah Dana,

<A HREF="#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  You haven't found out what he did during that war but that's how it is with most

what you have learned about   Amariah Dana ,who not only fought in the French and Indian
War but also did a lot of fighting  in the Revolutionary War.  He was a real patriot, even
naming my wife "Freedom Dana."  But after we talk about him, let's not forget that you had
other  kinfolk who also fought against the British, like  my other grandfather, Hezekiah

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Amariah Dana was born in 1738 at Pomfret, Connecticut, where he married Dorothy
May in 1763, just four years after his  service in the French and Indian War.  They joined the
church there the next year when their first child, Ezra, was born.  Over the next six years, four
more children; Lucinda, Eleazer, Dorothy, and Lucretia; were born as the colonies moved
closer toward the time of Revolution.  <A HREF="#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Amariah Dana probably wasn't  thinking revolution when, he got hold of  land through
one of those New Hampshire grants a couple of years before he married Dorothy May.  He
might have just wanted to settle down and work a small farm.  But getting tangled up with
those land grants was trouble because  the British governor, Benning Wentworth, used those
New Hampshire land grants to cheat people.  Your ancestral uncle, William Ewing, got caught
in a similar land mess. <A HREF="#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>   And you know from  your readings that New Yorkers tried to get
those grant holders to buy their land all over again.  That's about when Ethan Allen gathered
his "Green Mountain Boys, including Amariah Dana,  to fight them off. <A HREF="#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	They weren't the only rebels and those land grants weren't the only issues.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  People also got mad about taxes, especially that  Stamp Act  in 1765,.  What nerve!.  Forcing
folks to buy expensive stamps for their  legal papers..  That's when the  "Sons of Liberty" got
started. .  Oh, there was lots of anger - all headed for bloodshed.  And sure enough, five years
later British soldiers killed four men  and wounded seven in Boston.   People don't forget
things like that.  For the next thirteen it was remembered every fifth of March when somebody
would give  a speech in Boston's Old South Meeting House - until 1783 when they changed
it to Fourth of July speeches.   But that so-called "massacre" wasn't the only trouble in
Boston.  There was that Boston Tea Party in 1773.  Fifty men dressed up like Indians.  And
one of them was your ancestral uncle, Colonel John May. uncle to Amariah Dana's wife.  <A HREF="#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
He and the rest of those men boarded three ships, cut open more than 300 chests of tea, and
dumped it overboard.  After that we were headed toward war.  Patrick Henry knew that when
he spoke out in 1775.  <A HREF="#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"It is too late to retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and

as for me, give me liberty or give me death."</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	That Patrick Henry knew what he was talking about.   War did come in 1775 when
General Gage sent 800 redcoats to Lexington where they were supposed to arrest Samuel
Adams and John Hancock before going on to Concord where patriots had stored some military
supplies.  Every schoolboy knows what happened then.  Yes, Paul Revere saw the lantern
signal in Boston's North Church belfry, sending him on his way to tell everybody that the
British were coming.  So when the redcoats got to Lexington on April 19, they were met by
Captain John Parker and fifty minute-men.  You've heard Parker's famous words.</SPAN></P>

were wounded.  At Concord, more than 400 minute-men turned back the British regulars.  By
noon the British were hightailing it back to Boston. Next day Governor Gage was hemmed
in at Boston by an army of 16,000 patriots.  And one of the minute-men there was my
grandfather, Hezekiah Mehuren. <A HREF="#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	We've already talked about Amariah Dana connecting  with Ethan Allen and the
"Green Mountain Boys," but you're not sure when or where.  Was it in Pomfret, Connecticut,
where he might have been trying to protect his land grant?  If he was up against the Crown
then, that could have been a bad time for Amariah.  If so, it wasn't  his only bad time at
Pomfret.  Both of his parents died there in 1770.  <A HREF="#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  Three years later Amariah moved his
pregnant wife and family from Pomfret  to Amherst, Massachusetts.  Now maybe that move 
had nothing to do with land grant problems but who knows?   If such troubles forced him to
move, he  very well could have been bitter and angry toward the Crown, especially when his
baby daughter, Lucretia, fell under a wagon wheel when  they were going through
Belchertown.  How painful it must have been when they had to bury the poor babe there.  But
they had to move on and they did.  They settled in Amherst where Dorothy Dana gave birth
to another baby girl in October, 1773.  They named her Lucretia too, in memory of the poor
baby killed at Belchertown.  <A HREF="#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Did all those events have anything to do with Amariah joining up with Ethan Allen? 
 Maybe and maybe not.  But whatever the reason he did hook up with Ethan and his "Green
Mountain Boys," helping them to capture Fort Ticonderoga.<A HREF="#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>   Now isn't that a  much
better story than what happened in that same area  back in 1758  when my poor grandfather,
Seth Willis, was fighting with the British against the French.  So let's take a look at how
Amariah Dana might have gotten involved with all that.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Amariah may have been recruited by Colonel John Brown, a young lawyer in Pittsfield
who wanted Ethan Allen and the "Green Mountain Boys" to take Fort Ticonderoga as soon
as any fighting broke out. <A HREF="#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  Brown gathered up a bunch of Massachusetts men.  Some say
about forty.  Others say more.  <A HREF="#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  Whatever the number, it's likely that Amariah Dana was one
of them.  They joined with another sixteen men who came up from Connecticut, commanded
by Colonel Samuel Parsons.  This was probably around May, 1775, just two weeks after
Amariah's daughter, Mary, was born.  Then they all went to the Catamount Tavern in
Bennington where they joined the leaders of the "Green Mountain Boys"  to plan what they
were going to do next.  From there they went to Richard Bentley's farmhouse at Castleton
where they assembled, organized,  and made some more plans.  And maybe that's where it
was decided that the Massachusetts men  would be commanded by Colonel James Easton.  
After that meeting, Ethan Allen went on ahead to spy out the land.  While he was out doing
that, some of the men were sent to Skenesboro to capture Major Philip Skene, a big Tory
landholder in those part, and then to find some boats for crossing the lake. <A HREF="#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You're wondering if Amariah Dana might have been with those soldiers  going after
Major Skein.  But maybe he was with all  those who stayed back at Bentley's farmhouse and
were there when Benedict Arnold arrived.   Arnold busted into the room where Ethan Allen
was making plan, waving a fancy commission around and demanding command of the force. 
Can you picture what happened when the two of them  went outside to announce  that to 
Amariah and all those other men who  didn't give a  hoot about the commission even if it was 
from the  Massachusetts Provincial Congress's Committee of Safety.   They didn't care that
it said that Arnold could raise a force, appoint officers, and go on to take Fort Ticonderoga
so  he could capture some  cannon.  Yes, it must have been some scene.  Here's one of the
stories about what happened:</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"Colonel Arnold strode into the place where Ethan was laying out his plan, produced
his commission and announced that he had come to take command.  Ethan looked at Arnold
and the paper.  It was a fine commission, written in an ornate hand on long paper.  Ethan had
no such commission.  All he had was a document from the Connecticut legislature.  So Ethan
nodded and asked Colonel Arnold to come outside, so Ethan might say a few words to explain
the change to the troops.  Colonel Arnold was gratified.  He followed Ethan, who was dressed
in his ragged Green Mountain Boys uniform.  (Ethan was one of the few who had any uniform
at all) and they moved among the Boys, who were squatting and sitting among their
campfires.  Summoning them with his loudest voice, Ethan explained that the handsome
debonair colonel had come to lead them all into battle and he showed the commission.  The
plan would be the same.  The pay would be the same, about two dollars per man.  Only the
command would be different.  The Boys in their buckskins scrutinized the cockatoo colonel
in the blue uniform, and in a very leisurely way got up and began to stack their arms, the
symbol of a camp at rest.  It was their announcement of their intention.  Colonel Arnold
watched, at first in unconcern and then in growing dismay as the import of the action grew
on him.  The Boys began to speak up.  They were not going to serve under some pipsqueak
ordered from Boston.  Ethan Allen was their colonel and had been for four years.  Arnold still
wanted that command - the glory was there to be seized.  Then Ethan said no, he was not
going to jeopardize the success of the expedition, and Arnold could not have command.  But
here is what Ethan would do; Arnold could walk with him and see what happened, though he
was not to interfere." <A HREF="#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	 You don't know one way or another but when you read that piece, you did  like the
thought that your 4<SUP>th</SUP> great-grandfather might have been one of the men who spoke up and
object to Arnold.  In that spirit you enjoyed this more colorful version.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"He appears to have told Ethan curtly that the Committee had ordered him to take
charge of the expedition.  An imperious manner was not the thing to try on Colonel Allen. 
Exactly what happened next has been lost in one hundred and sixty-five years of controversy
but it is certain that a violent row ensued.  Ethan vowed, by God, that he had been elected to
lead the attack.  Arnold, proud as a peacock and dressed much like one, waved his
commission from Cambridge.  Somebody, doubtless old Peleg Sunderland, suggested hanging
'the fancy barstard,' and men shouted that if they were not to be commanded by their own
officers, the hell with the War, if that was what is was; they would shoulder their arms and
go home.  Knowing they had no time to spare and that a controversy might wreck the
expedition, Ethan and his second in command, Easton, told the unruly soldiers that Allen
should lead them.  Privately, it would appear from the record, Allen gave Arnold permission
to march with him at the head of the column."  <A HREF="#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	From that account you might guess that Amariah Dana was about ready to head back
to Amherst if Arnold took command.  But it seem that he and Allen worked out some sort of
compromise.  It was a shaky sort of truce and Arnold tried again to take over when they got
to Fort Ticonderoga.    And you're not really sure how large their force was when they got
there.  The Dana genealogy sources say that Amariah was one of 63 men at Ticonderoga. 
Other sources say that around eighty men were with Ethan Allen when he took the fort. <A HREF="#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> 
<A HREF="#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"After the invasion force of some eighty men had landed on the shore near the
fortress... Colonel Arnold stuck in his horn again.  He stepped forward and demanded that he
command the attack.  An now Colonel Allen, his nerves already much frayed, exploded.  'By
God, sir,' he roared, laying hand to his sword, 'I'll have you to understand I am in command
here!'  Then turning to Amos Callender, one of his old Green Mountain Boys, Ethan asked,
'What shall I do with this damned rascal?  Shall I put him under guard?'  But Ethan took no
further step just then.  There wasn't time  if the attack was to be a surprise.  Stepping to front
and center of his army, the tall commander delivered a brief army-style pep talk, full of
bombastic praise for his gallant troops.  He told the Boys that they were the scourge and terror
of all arbitrary power.  He said that the fortress before them must be taken quickly, once the
attack  was begun.  He called it a desperate attempt which none but the bravest of men would
dare undertake at all and gave the faint-hearted a chance to get out before it was too late... 
'You that will undertake voluntarily,' he said, 'will poise your firelocks.'  Up went an
assortment of rifles, pistols, fowling pieces, blunderbusses, clubs, hangers, hunting knives. 
It is doubtful if a greater range of weapons was used in any engagement of the Revolution. 
Ethan looked the mob over and was content.  'Forward march,' he ordered.  He was at the
head of the column with Arnold beside him, the only figure of military appearance in the lot." 
<A HREF="#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	What kind of a weapon do you suppose Amariah had?  Probably a good one because
he knew what he was doing as a solider, having gotten a taste of it during the French and
Indian War.  You can imagine that he might have relished the thought of attacking the British
after all that trouble with his land grant.  And this tale gives you an idea of how eager the
"Green Mountain Boys" were to take them on.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"When they entered the fort, the men were at best pseudo-soldiers.  Now, even though
they had not tasted blood, they became as wild as the Indians.  Some of them were
accustomed to fighting.  Howling 'No quarter!' and imitating the war cries of Mohawks, they
tore through the parade ground to batter at the many doors of the barracks.  Bedlam had come
to Ticonderoga."  <A HREF="#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Can you picture my father-in-law whooping it up like an Indian and changing through
the fort looking for redcoats.  What a sight Amariah must have been that day!  Could he have
been the one that the British soldier lunged at in the next part of this story.  If so, he would
have been right on the spot to see Ethan Allen confronting the sleepy British lieutenant who
came out without any pants on.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"One brave but careless redcoat came out of the guardroom to lunge at an invader with
his fixed bayonet.  Ethan saw the move and fetched the redcoat a terrific swipe over the head
with the flat of his sword, felling him to the ground.  A heavy comb in the man's hair saved
his skull.  Quarter, quarter!" he begged.  Ethan poised is sword as if to run the man through,
then thought better of it.  'Take me to your commander,' he bellowed.  The fallen man jumped
to his feet to lead the way to the foot of a short stairway to the upper portion of the west
barracks.  'The officers' quarters are there," he said.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	With a leap like a catamount, Ethan started up the stairs..  'Come out of there, you
sons of British bitches,' he called in a right clear voice.  As he spoke the door opened
revealing an officer wearing coat and waistcoat and a pair of drawers.  He carried his breeches
over one arm.  The apparition was not, as Ethan believed, the fort's commander.  It was
Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, second in command to Captain Delaplace.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The pantless lieutenant faced enough trouble on the stairs to have made many an
officer lose his head.  There was the gigantic figure of Allen with a sword , not seen every
day.  Next to Allen was the very military Colonel Arnold.  And back of Arnold, crowing the
stairs, was a mob of shouting, howling wild men, every one of them displaying arms and most
them crying aloud for British blood."  <A HREF="#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Amariah very well might have been one of those shouting that he wanted to kill some
redcoats.  Or maybe he was just laughing at the sight of a lieutenant minus  his pants and
trying to keep his dignity while talking to Ethan Allen, Benedict Arnold, and a mob of 
Allen's followers.   Amariah may not have been impressed by the sight of that lieutenant but
he surely must have been impressed by Ethan Allen's colorful language.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"The lieutenant was as brave as they came.  He remained cool.  Stalling for time in the
hope that his garrison would rally and begin shooting into the invaders, he asked for silence
which was accorded.  Then he spoke.  'By what authority have you entered His Majesty's
fort? he demanded.... Then Colonel Ethan Allen... let him have it.     'In the name of the Great
Jehovah and the Continental Congress,' he answered with some dignity. <A HREF="#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Lieutenant Feltham...continued to stall for time, still hoping that his soldiers would
appear below stairs and run these hoodlums out of the fort.  'Who are you people?' he began,
'and who - '</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Ethan leaped to the landing beside Feltham.  'By God,' he swore, 'I shall have
possession of this fort and all the effects of George the Third!'  And he waved his great sword
over and around the lieutenant' head.  The mob below stairs set up a shouting.  The leveled
their muskets at the one lone and trouserless redcoat while Ethan ripped out a series of oaths
so shocking that his own men listened in rapt wonder.  'And if you don't immediately
comply,' he concluded, 'no man, woman or child shall be left alive in this goddam place.'</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Feltham replied correctly that he was not the commander.  Sensing now that the man
he wanted to see was in the room behind Feltham, Ethan started to batter in the door.  Arnold 
dissuaded him and presently Captain Delplace, fully dressed, came out.  Shoving Feltham into
the upper room and placing two sentries, Allen and Arnold took Delaplace below to discuss
affairs.  While these events were going forward, the invaders had broken into all the barrack
rooms, finding several redcoats still in bed.  The garrison's arms were collected and thrown
into a room and a guard set.  Captain Delaplace was ordered to parade his men without arms,
which was done.  Ticonderoga was taken, the first British position to fall."  <A HREF="#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	So what do you think Amariah and all those other men did after they secured the fort? 
Think they curled up quietly for a nap?  Hah!  Not very likely.  No, they probably celebrated,
getting drunk on the British liquor supplies and generally raising hell.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"The attention of the victors, naturally enough, was first directed not to the ordnance
captured, but to the vast stores of rum in the fort.  The door leading to the private cellar of
Captain Delaplace was quickly breached by strong thirsty men wielding musket butts and
artillery rammers.  It yielded an even ninety gallons of strong excellent stuff.  The garrison's 
issue  rum stores were also attacked with vigor.. With things running so smoothly, Colonel
Allen, Colonel Easton, and John Brown bellied around the ex-commandant's tale tin the
officers' quarters.  They filled mugs to the brim and tossed them down in the manner of two-fisted drinking men.  The rank and file went hog-wild.  Yelling like crazed devils, they ran
everywhere through the fort, breaking into every room, cellar, shed and cupboard, plundering
or scattering whatever they happened on The twenty-odd women and children must have been
frightened out of their wits but there was then or later no charge of ill-treatment in this
quarter." <A HREF="#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Amariah and his fellow soldiers weren't the only ones celebrating.  Folks from all over
the countryside came into the fort when they heard all the commotion.  This account sound
like they got caught in the spirit of the festivities and had a wild time</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"By now more than two hundred American swarmed in and around the fort and they
wee joined throughout the day by country folk from near-by farms, come to see what was up. 
Soldiers and farmers fell downstairs, tumbled off walls; broke jugs, bottles, windows. 
Matthew Lyon, the ebullient Irish-Yankee, who later became a national character, felt that
.something special was needed to mark the day.  Fetching a bucket of powder from the
magazine, he poured it down the gullet of Old Sow, a thirteen-inch mortar, and let her go.  It
was a blast so mighty, legend has it, that the fort fairly rocked and five patriots, snoozing dead
drunk in Delaplace's cellar, were immediately revived and were able to finish the day on their
feet, much to the credit of the Green Mountain Boys."  <A HREF="#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	I suppose that Amariah and just about everybody else was having a fine old time. 
Except for one unhappy man, Benedict Arnold.  As a disciplined army officer, he just couldn't
understand the "Green Mountain Boys."  He must have hated the way they treated him.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"Colonel Arnold was aghast at the pillage and drunkenness.  He attempted to put a
stop to it and to force some degree of discipline but to no avail.  And later he reported that
Colonel Allen was 'a proper man to head his own wild people' but was wholly unfit for
military command.  Arnold again brought up the matter as to his own 'rightful' command of
the fort, pointing out that Allen had no commission at all.  Hot words passed between the two
colonels.  The convivial soldiers also took a hand, and again they declared that if Ethan was
not their commander, then by God, they'd up and go home, the whole lot of them - an empty
threat so long as the liquor held out... Colonel Arnold put in some very bad hours.  The
soldiers hooted him, called him vile names, and he wrote in his memorandum book that at
least two of them fired their muskets in a manner to send balls whistling close by him."  <A HREF="#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	How about that?  Now we speculate that my father-in-law might have been one of
those shooting at Benedict Arnold.  Who knows?  But considering what a traitor Arnold
turned out to be later on, maybe it would have been just as well for Amariah or some other
patriot to kill him.  I'd bet they were all getting fed up with Arnold's repeated posturing and
his efforts to take command away from their cherished Ethan Allen.  Bet that as it may,
Arnold did manage to gather some new recruits a few days later.  With those as his new
command, he left Allen and set off on his own, capturing the single remaining British sloop
on the lake at the little village of St. Jean on May 18.  Coming back on that boat, he met Ethan
and ninety of his mean in a fleet.  They were headed toward St. Jean, intending to occupy and
hold it.   That was against Arnold's opinion that the adventure was useless and not practical
since the American now controlled the lake.  Despite Arnold's advice, Allen and his men
arrived at St. Jean and learned that some British troops were advancing toward the village. 
At first they decided to ambush the redcoats but then decided against it.  Then they crossed
the Richelieu River and encamped for the night.  But the next morning they woke up to a
volley of grapeshot and musketry from British artillery.  They fled to their boats and all but
three escaped. <A HREF="#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Once again you can only wonder if Amariah Dana among those in that expedition. 
And you do n't know exactly when he left Ethan Allen and went back to his home in Amherst. 
You know only that by May 22 Ethan's St. Jean's expedition was back at Crown Point while
Arnold was at Ticonderoga.  And you know that his men had been steadily departing for their
homes and that in another week they were all gone, leaving Allen with no command.  <A HREF="#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Anyway Amariah was probably back with his family by the end of May, perhaps
enjoying a well-deserved rest.  Ah, but do you wonder if he might have been tempted to be
part of the next great battle of the Revolution?   For it was only weeks later that more than a
thousand British and more than four hundred patriots were killed and wounded at the Battle
of Bunker Hill in Charlestown.  <A HREF="#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A>No, Amariah was not there but he must have been intensely
interested in it.  Not just because it was an important battle but because part of the
battleground had once belonged to his mother's uncle, Edward Sumner.  <A HREF="#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A>  You learned that
from this account.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"Immediately after the Battle of Bunker Hill... some trees in Edward Sumner's
orchard... were cut down, sharpened to points and then  so placed as pickets to protect the
portions exposed to attack.  Five hundred men and officers constituted the main and picket
guard for this line where Edward Sumner once lived so peacefully. <A HREF="#N_60_"><SUP> (60)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	It wasn't too long after Bunker Hill that Amariah Dana was back in action.  This time
he was a Revolutionary War  soldier with Captain James Hendrick's company in Charlestown
on Jan 13, 1776, less than a week after he death of his twelve year old son, Ezra..  Six months
later the Declaration of Independence was signed.  That must have inspired Amariah to name
my wife "Freedom Dana" when she was born about sixteen months later on May 2, 1777.  Her
birth didn't slow down Amariah's soldiering..  Five days after that event he enlisted again,
serving two months before returning home where he remained for the next five weeks until
he joined up again.  But this time for only three days, responding to an alarm. <A HREF="#N_61_"><SUP> (61)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	No record of any other military service for Amariah.  You don't know what he did
during the rest of 177, that awful year when Washington's men suffered through Valley Forge. 
So many men with bloody, bar, frost-bitten feet.  So much sickness.  Feisty as Amariah was,
he might not have survived that winter.  But he wasn't there.  And you have no idea what he
did in 1778.  But you do know that his wife, Dorothy, died of dropsy the next year, Dec 9,
1779, after bearing Amariah eight children.  My poor wife.  Freedom was only about two and
a half years old when her mother died.  Amariah was left with six motherless children,   That
must about when he decided to let one of his wife's relatives adopt six-year old Lucretia. Why
little Lucretia?   Do you suppose it had anything to do with her being named after that poor
baby Lucretia that fell under the wagon wheel?  Maybe her name brought back painful
memories for Amariah.  But maybe the decision had nothing to do with that. And who was
the relative of Amariah's wife who adopted the second Lucretia.  Why none other than her
uncle, Colonel John May of Boston Tea Party fame.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Amariah soon realized that he needed another wife to help raise all those children.  So
he married Ruth Williams in 1780 and  had eight more children  <A HREF="#N_62_"><SUP> (62)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	After being with Ethan Allen and soldiering in the Revolution, you would think that
Amariah would have had enough of rebellion.  But not my father-in-law.  Amariah and his
grown son, Eleazer, were both active in Shays Rebellion.  You got some idea of why they did
so when you read about how Daniel Shays led a rebellion by farmers in western
Massachusetts ho were sick of the high taxes, the unstable currency, and the expenses of
lawsuits in land disputes.  For Amariah, such mismanagement of government might have been
just as galling as the land-grabbing actions of the New Yorkers years earlier.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	On August 19, 1786, Shays' rebel mobs stormed the courthouse in Northampton to
prevent the trial and imprisonment of debtors.  Then in September Shays and 600 armed
farmers stormed the courthouse in Springfield.  Amariah and Eleazer  could  have been with
Shays during either or both of those courthouse attacks.  And maybe they were with him on
January 25, 1787, when he led 2000 rebels to Springfield to storm the arsenal.  The rebels
were subdued, captured and sentenced to death but were later pardoned.  Amariah and Eleazar
were very possibly  among those because they both took an oath of allegiance in February,
1787, probably as a condition pardon after their actions in the rebellion.  <A HREF="#N_63_"><SUP> (63)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_64_"><SUP> (64)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Amariah might have come close to execution in 1787 but he seems to have settled
down after that.  He was probably as patriotic as ever in 1812 when that second war with
Britain broke out.  At age 74, he was then much too old to fight again.  However his son,
Joseph, and his grandson, Austin, were soldiers in that war.  <A HREF="#N_65_"><SUP> (65)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Amariah Dana's second wife, Ruth Williams, died of dropsy on April 14, 1822.  You
don't have any information about how he lived his next eight years but you do know that he
was living with his son, Joseph, at Amherst in 1830 and that he died on October 29<SUP>th</SUP> of that
year at the ripe old age of ninety-two.  You visited his grave in the South Amherst cemetery

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	I've notice that as you've studied how your Willis ancestors moved from the
Stoughton/Easton area of Norfolk county to western Massachusetts, you've learned to pay
more attention to little pieces of information.  Like what you read about  Seth Willis living
in North Easton not far from Josiah Keith's family.  So they were neighbors.  Josiah's
daughter, Silence, was a young widow when Seth married her in 1746, having married
Benjamin Smith in 1739. <A HREF="#N_67_"><SUP> (67)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You don't know  when Seth and Silence moved to Worthington in western
Massachusetts but you are guessing that it was probably around 1774 which was the year of
Seth's  last land sale. <A HREF="#N_68_"><SUP> (68)</SUP></A>   You also  know that they were in Worthington in 1790, as was their
son, Amasa, who married Hezekiah Mehurin' daughter, Maria.  And of course Amasa and
Maria  were my parents.  Hezekiah  was among the first settlers of Worthington after 1764
and his wife, Abigail,  was one of the first people recorded in the Worthington church.  <A HREF="#N_69_"><SUP> (69)</SUP></A>   <A HREF="#N_70_"><SUP> (70)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You also saw that another of your ancestors, Reverend Stephen Tracy, from nearby
Partridgeville, had one of his daughters, Susanna, baptized in the Worthington Congregational
Church on 24 May 1778.  She was a sister to Mary Tracy who married Titus Doolittle.  Their
daughter, Sarah, married  my son, Russell and they became your  great-great grandparents. 
So you see you have a lot of ancestors connected with the Worthington church. <A HREF="#N_71_"><SUP> (71)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Louis, I know that on one of the walls in your home, you've got a picture of the
present Congregational Church in Worthington that replaced the large colonial steepled
church that burned in 1887.  I remember that older church and many other things about
Worthington.    Especially the story that the old settlers told about the cave on Goffe Hill. 
They said that three men had once come there and lived in the cave, probably in the winter
of 1677 and 1678.  One of them died and the other two went north.... The story was that the
three men were three of the judges who signed the death warrant of King Charles I and then
fled to New England when King Charles II was restored to the throne - Edward Whalley,
William Goffe, and John Dixwell.    Ah, that story reminds you of your visit to a cave in New
Haven where Whalley and Goffe hid because you knew that the cave was on land that once
belonged to another one fo your ancestors, Richard Sperry, who helped hid and feed the
regicides.   And you read somewhere that when they left New Haven, they went north to
Hadley and that a third regicide, John Dixwell, joined them there but later went back to New
haven.  But all of that was  many years before any of your Willis or Mehurin ancestors lived
in those parts.  In fact it was about a hundred years before Seth Willis suffered some terrible
misfortunes in his old age.  <A HREF="#N_72_"><SUP> (72)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_73_"><SUP> (73)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Reading the records of the Congregational Church in Worthington, you found an entry
dated July 7, 1789, which recorded the church's concern with some incident in which  Eli
Metcalf was accused of  cheating  Seth Willis .  <A HREF="#N_74_"><SUP> (74)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_75_"><SUP> (75)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Examining earlier  church records, you saw  that  Metcalf  joined the church in 1774,
was  accused of lying in 1785, and  in 1786, confessed to the church his fault "for uttering a
false report about himself, or for calling himself a Doctor or professed physician."     Looking
ahead  you found that the church minutes for August 17, 1789 provided more details about
Eli Metcalf's conduct toward Seth Willis. </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"The Chh met according to  adjournment at 9:00 o-clock A.M. at the Meeting House,
and whereas Eli Metcalf then stood charges, by the aforesaid Complaint, with injustice and
fraud in keeping back a part of what was charitably bestowed on or for the above named S.
Willis and entrusted to the care of said Metcalf to deliver to said Willis, who was then in
needy circumstance on account of his dwelling house, household furniture, provision &amp;c
being consumed by fire, which took  place about the close of the year 1788: Willis was
committed a few weeks after this.."  <A HREF="#N_76_"><SUP> (76)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You were saddened to learn that  my grandfather's house burned down, leaving him
a pauper.   And  you were shocked to learn that Eli Metcalf cheated him out of money that was
donated for his welfare.  lost everything when his house burned down.  Finally you puzzled
over the last sentence is this part of the church minutes.  What was the "commitment" of Seth
Willis?   You wondered if my grandfather was committed to an almshouse or whether the
sentence merely meant that he was committed to the welfare of the church.  Who knows? .
Anyway  from further reading of the church minutes, you learned that the church supported
the charge against Metcalf and also charged him for being a liar. <A HREF="#N_77_"><SUP> (77)</SUP></A>.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">       Yes, the Worthington church saw that Eli Metcalf did indeed cheat my grandfather. 
Reading further in those church records you found there was a second admonition by the
church to Metalf over his keeping money that was supposed to go to Set Willis.   Looks like
that first admonition didn't do much good.  Metcalf must not have been truly penitent.  And
this was still a hot topic for the church.  They weren't about to forget it.  But they did want
to give Metcalf another chance to own up and repent.  So they did the second admonition a
month after the first. <A HREF="#N_78_"><SUP> (78)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You'd think that Metcalf would have learned his lesson by then.  But it's plain that he
didn't.  Even though he was given nine months in which to repent.  So it was in the summer
of 1790 when the church got together again.  The minutes for June 24 showed that Metcalf
hadn't yet satisfied the church for the offenses proved against him though he had been "kindly
and faithfully warned and admonished hor his Offences once and again" The church then
voted to have the pastor write up an act of  Excommunication which was put before them on
July 11. <A HREF="#N_79_"><SUP> (79)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	I remember hearing a lot talk about that excommunication when I was about ten.  I
thought it served Metcalf right for the shameful way he cheated my grandfather.  But you're
wondering what happened  next, after the ex-communication was delivered.  There is nothing
more about matter in the rest of 1790 church records.  But the 1790 census told you that Seth
Willis was living in Worthington with one female,  probably his wife.  My father, Amasa.
Willis, is also listed on that census with two other males, both under 16, and  three females.
<A HREF="#N_80_"><SUP> (80)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Not long ago you learned of a sad sequel to the life of Seth Willis.  You knew  that his
daughter, Silence, had married John Fenton at Worthington in 1776 and apparently moved
some time after that to Rutland, Vermont.  <A HREF="#N_81_"><SUP> (81)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_82_"><SUP> (82)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   Misfortune and tragedy by fire seemed to
follow Seth's daughter and son-in-law into Rutland, Vermont.   On July 19<SUP>th</SUP>, 1799, John
Fenton's barn was "struck by  the lightning, and consumed with a considerable quantity of
hay."  <A HREF="#N_83_"><SUP> (83)</SUP></A>  But the most tragic event occurred in 1818 when John lost his life and Silence was
seriously injured when their home was destroyed by fire as related in the following newspaper
account:  <A HREF="#N_84_"><SUP> (84)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   "From the Rutland Herald, of Wednesday, we copy the following melancholly event: -  On
Sunday morning, between the hours of 3 and 4 o'clock, the family of Mr. John Fenton, of this
town, were awakened by the burning of flames in their dwelling - Unable to secure an article
of clothing, they were compelled to buffet the wintry storm in a mere nightly attire.  In this
situation, Mrs. Fenton, a feeble lady of near 70, ran to her son's a distance of between 30 and
40 rods for assistance.  In a similar attire, her son repaired to the scene of conflagration; but
only to witness a spectacle more awful than the mere destruction of an earthly tenement. -
Notwithstanding the first escape of the family from the house, and the almost hopeless
prospect presented of preserving any thing from the devouring element, it seems Mr. F.
thought it advisable to attempt the rescue of certain articles of property.  He again entered: but
not to return!  Suffocated, as is supposed, by smoke, he was unable to extricate himself.  The
scanty assistance then present, and the want of knowledge as to what part of the house he was
in, rendered it impossible to afford him relief.  Indeed, human aid could not, probably, have
preserved him.  After the falling of the building, and the extinguishing of a part of the fire, his
body was discovered on a remnant of  the lower floor, though nearly consumed.  Being found
near the place where a window had been, it is conjectured that he attempted to escape through
it; but that suffocation ensued ere he could raise the sash.  Mr. F. was in his 69th year of age,
and a man of unblemished character.  His loss is deeply lamented.  The fir is supposed to have
originated from embers which were taken up in a wooden vessel the afternoon preceeding,
and which were placed in a back part of the house.  Another warning to persons to be cautious
how they deposit their ashes.  The hands and feet of the family, we understand, were frozen-
the feet of Mrs. Fenton and of a young man who lived in the house severely.  We are happy
to learn that many donations have already been made to the sufferers.  A charitable disposition
which so pre-eminently characterizes the citizens of this town, we hope will continue to be
manifest."</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	There were other changed in the family during that same general period.  From the
Worthington church records for October 31, 1790, you learned that my mother's parents,
Hezekiah and Abigail Mahurin, were no longer in that community.  From other records you
found that they had moved to Middletown in Rutland county, Vermont, were Hezekiah
apparently died about 1806.  <A HREF="#N_85_"><SUP> (85)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_86_"><SUP> (86)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	During those years my father's household was growing.  So were my responsibilities
as the oldest son.  By 1790 I had two younger brothers, Lyman and Elijah, and three younger
sisters; Meriam, Maria, and Silence.  We were all still living in Worthington in 1797 when
my father bought land there from Timothy Moeech.  But four years later I left the nest when
I married Freedom Dana.<A HREF="#N_87_"><SUP> (87)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_88_"><SUP> (88)</SUP></A>  When you examined a number of land records, you figured out
that Freedom and I moved from Worthington to nearby Chesterfield in 1803.  <A HREF="#N_89_"><SUP> (89)</SUP></A> And when
you read a history of the families of Chesterfield, you found that most of my children were
born there.  By 1803  I had three daughters - Abigail, Lucretia, and Silence.  Poor little Silence
died at the end of August of that year.  My namesake son, Rufus, was born in 1806.  Those
were the four children we had by 1807 when Grandfather Seth died. <A HREF="#N_90_"><SUP> (90)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	My grandfather, Seth Willis was eighty-seven years old when he died on September
2, 1807.  That was seventeen years after Eli Metcalf was ex-communicated for swindling him.
His death was recorded in the Worthington church records but the history of the families of
Chesterfield said that he died in that town.  You had hoped that you might settle the location
question when you visited Chesterfield in 1993 but that was not to be.  You found that many
of the tombstones in the old Ireland Street cemetery were missing and that over the years
neighboring farmers had taken them to use for walkways or for construction.  What a
shameful thing to do with tombstones that families put up to remember their loved ones! <A HREF="#N_91_"><SUP> (91)</SUP></A>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Going back to the Worthington church records, you saw the following record that Eli
Metcalf came back to the church five days after Seth Willis died and convinced them that he
was finally repenting that he had cheated my grandfather.  <A HREF="#N_92_"><SUP> (92)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"Sept 7, 1807... Mr. Eli Metcalf made a public confession of the sins for which he was
excommunicated many years ago, and was restored to his former standing in the church.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Seventeen years of excommunication before he confessed!  And then only after my
grandfather had died.  Do you wonder why it took him so long to repent?  Did Grandfather's
death have much to do with Metcalf's repentance?  Was Metacalf really as penitent as the
church thought he was.  Did my grandfather ever forgive him?  You'll never really know, will
you?  More mysteries. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	What do you think about a Congregational church excommunicating one of its
members?  Unusual?  Ah, but you must remember that in my grandfather's time, the affairs
of the Parish in Worthington were managed and conducted by the town in regular town
meetings, acting in the double capacity of town and parish.  The covenant members agreed
that they would watch over their Brethern and that when any Brother was offended with
anyone of the church he shall not complain until has laboured with the one he is offended with
in a Gospel way.  That means that before Newcomb Cleveland brought his complaint to the
church, he must have tried to talk with Eli Metcalf about his shameful treatment of Seth
Willis.<A HREF="#N_93_"><SUP> (93)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	As you read those old church minutes, you saw that church members admonished
those who were not attending church.  But some of the Worthington men were not easily
intimidated by such admonitions.  One of these was Timothy Meech whom my father knew
well.  He bought land from Timothy in 1797 and then sold land to him in 1806.  <A HREF="#N_94_"><SUP> (94)</SUP></A>  Meech
joined the church in 1780 but did not attend. <A HREF="#N_95_"><SUP> (95)</SUP></A> He was an independent man and not at all
impressed by the church's admonitions.   That's evident from this description. <A HREF="#N_96_"><SUP> (96)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"Apparently the members of the Brotherhood were a contentious lot and pretty
independent... One such man was Timothy Meeck.  At the meeting in February of 1782, a
committee was chosen to admonish Brother Meeck for the first time, and in March they
reported that in February they had called upon Meeck 'to inquire of the reasons of his
absenting himself (from church) as he had not attended once since he had joined.'  To which
he replied: </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	'No, nor I never intend to have any more concern with this church than I would with
the Devil.'</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"Either at this time or at another meeting with the committee he is reported to have
said, 'And, by God, I'll say 'by God' whenever I want, by God.'</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"In February, a year later, the church meeting voted that Meeck be rejected by the
church and excluded all the privileges for withdrawing and absenting himself at sundry times
when the Moderator had requested him to tarry and do business and for his 'Daring and
presumptuous and extravagant talk and behaviour, and, after being properly admonished, for
his obstinacy in refusing to make satisfaction for his disorderly walk."</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	That was Meech, all right.  Not about to let church folks or anybody else tell him what
to do or not to do.  But in truth, what the Worthington church did with their admonishments
and excommunications was mild compared to what some other Massachusetts churches and
towns did in earlier times.  You're read some accounts of worse practices.  <A HREF="#N_97_"><SUP> (97)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	"Anyone who should dare to speculate too freely about the nature of Christ, or the
philosophy of the plan of salvation, or to express a doubt as to the plenary inspiration of every
word between the two covers of the Bible, was subject to fine and imprisonment.  The tithing-man still arrested Sabbath-breakers and shut them up in the town-cage in the marketplace; he
stopped all unnecessary riding or driving on Sunday, and hauled people off to the meeting-house whether they would or not."</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Eli Metcalf's punishment was nothing compared to what he might have faced in a
town with such a tithing master.  Ah, some folks might have thought that he belonged in a
town cage.  But maybe he suffered enough from those seventeen years of excommunication. 
He was probably shunned and scorned by most of the people in Worthington.  And in our own
Chesterfield community, none of the Willises had much good to say about him.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	You don't  know what became of Seth Willis's wife, Silence.  You do know from your
examination of the 1810 census that she wasn't in my father's household where my two

name "Silence" in memory of our little daughter of the same name who died in 1803.  Then
our youngest daughter, Wealthy, was born in December, 1813. It wasn't long after that when
I started thinking about moving the family out to New York. I learned that a lot of land in
western New York was being sold on easy terms which was about all that I could then afford. 
Well, we didn't have much but I decided it was too good an opportunity to pass up.    <A HREF="#N_100_"><SUP> (100)</SUP></A> So
my father and I packed up the families and moved in the winter of 1818 to Little Valley. </SPAN></P>

our families to New York.  So here's a  story about me  that tells you something about what 
we faced making that trip and getting settled in what was then really just a wilderness:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 14pt"></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 14pt">     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Rufus Wyllys settled on lot 30, 1819. He was born in Massachusetts, 1780, and moved
from that State a distance of 500 miles, upon an ox-sled, being twenty-three days on the road.
The sled carried the family of eleven persons and all their worldly effects. John Wyllys, a son,
says their bread for much of the time was obtained by pounding corn on a block of wood.
They would try and pound it fine enough to get out a little fine meal for a "Johnny" cake for
breakfast, make the same for dinner, and the same for supper, if  they found the cows. For a
table, for several years, they used a slab split from a large cucumber log,<A HREF="#N_101_"><SUP> (101)</SUP></A> with four holes
bored in the corners, into which logs were driven; and the only chairs were made in the same
rude manner. "Catamounts" were used for bedsteads. At first they had to go to Fredonia to
mill. Afterwards, Kent's Mill was built on the headwaters of the Connewango. Their usual
mode of going to mill was with an ox team, drawing a crotch.   Afterwards they dug a canoe
from a pine log, and carried their grists in that on the Connewango. Mr. Wyllys and Samuel
Farlee built a sawmill on Elm Creek in 1823. ........John Wyllys, a son, lives on lot 27, aged
sixty-nine years, having lived in town fifty-nine years, and with one exception is the oldest
resident of Connewango. In speaking of the customs of the pioneer times he says, "It was
against the rule of the neighborhood for any one to build a chimney until they had first burned
out three logs of the house.<A HREF="#N_102_"><SUP> (102)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Life was wild and dangerous for us and for our few neighbors.  During our first winter
there, Sampson Crooker's wife had to use a pair of tongs to kill a wildcat that was invading
her hen roost.  Bears and wolves were always a problem.  John Darling got trapped overnight
by wolves one evening when he was out boiling maple sap <A HREF="#N_103_"><SUP> (103)</SUP></A>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	All of us in that area struggled during those early years, but things gradually got better
for our family after Sam and I built that sawmill.   With a lot of hard work over many years,
we eventually got to a place where we had a comfortable living.  We weren't rich, not by a
long shot.  But far better than when we first came to New York.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	From census records you got an idea of who was on our farm in 1820.   Freedom and
I were raising Rufus Jr, Russell, John, Silence, Wealthy, Abigail, and Lucretia.  And you saw
that our neighbors included my brother, Lyman, Daniel Grover and Thomas Darling.  Another
neighbor was Cyrus Childs, who was the third man to settle in Connewango.  His wife,
Miriam, had been born in Worthington.  <A HREF="#N_104_"><SUP> (104)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_105_"><SUP> (105)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	As our children grew up, most of them got married.   Abigail married Daniel  Grover's
son, Lewis..  Alvin, the first of their twelve children, was born about 1829.  Rufus Jr married
Dorcas Darling in 1830, about the same time when Lucretia married John Seaman.  Russell
married Sarah Doolittle in 1834.  By 1836 Wealthy and Hiram Seager were married.  And by
1839 Rufus Jr. had moved his family to Ohio.  In 1850 Lucretia's family was living in
Michigan.   Three years later, Rufus Jr had left Ohio and also moved to Michigan.</SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Then it wasn't too many years until the Civil War broke out.   Five of my grandsons 
were in that war.  Four of them were Abigail Grover's children.  In 1861 Gustavus Grover and
Delos Grover  both enlisted in Co. K, of the 64th New York Volunteers.  Both got out in
1863.  Gustavus's regiment was in  the battles at Fair Oaks, Williamsburg, Second Bull Run,
and Portsmouth.  He was wounded and was then mustered out at a convalescent hospital in
Virginia.  <A HREF="#N_106_"><SUP> (106)</SUP></A>  William Grover and Elisha Grover both went into artillery.  William was in the
Company A.  13th New York Heavy Artillery in 1864 and 1865.  <A HREF="#N_107_"><SUP> (107)</SUP></A>  Elisha  was in Company
G of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> Regiment , New York Heavy Artillery.  The fifth grandson in the war was
Russell's son, my namesake, Rufus T. Willis.  He was 19 in August, 1864 in Company A,
New York 13th Heavy Artillery Regiment and was mustered out ten months later  at Norfolk,
Virginia.  <A HREF="#N_108_"><SUP> (108)</SUP></A>.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Freedom and I are proud of all our children.  Our oldest ,Abigail,  married Lewis
Grover, a school teacher who was so large that a special chair had to be made for him.  Four
of their sons were soldiers in the Civil War.  <A HREF="#N_109_"><SUP> (109)</SUP></A>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Lucretia married John Seaman and moved
to Michigan where they had a farm.  Rufus Jr and his wife, Dorcas Darling, also moved to
Michigan and farmed.  You did hear a tale that he got interested in the Mormon religion, left
his family for a time and moved to Nauvoo where the Mormons wanted him to sign over his
farm.  The story goes that she refused, he gave up his Mormon beliefs, and returned to his
family. Well, I'm not going to confirm or deny that story.   So it's just one more thing for you
to wonder about.  <A HREF="#N_110_"><SUP> (110)</SUP></A>    As for our other children,  Wealthy Willis, married Hiram Seager. 
They  lived near us in New York where they too farmed.    John and Silence never married
but they too remained  in New York for the rest of their lives.  Russell married Sarah Doolittle
.  Sometime between 1860 and 1870, they moved to Missouri where Russell died in 1879.<A HREF="#N_111_"><SUP> (111)</SUP></A>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
Sarah moved back  to New York where she lived in 1880 in a household with John and
Silence, very close to the home where   Hiram and Wealthy were living.  .<A HREF="#N_112_"><SUP> (112)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Russell and Sarah's only daughter, Augusta, remained in New York where she had
married Henry Ewing in 1855.  Their oldest son, Frank (your grandfather), was born  a year
later.  Let's talk about him.  He was educated at Ellington  Academy, studied for the bar with
a lawyer  in Dunkirk, New York, and was admitted to practice in 1878.  <A HREF="#N_113_"><SUP> (113)</SUP></A>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Two years later
he was a boarder in the household of his uncle, Edson Augustus Willis, at Clarion, Marion
County, Kansas.  <A HREF="#N_114_"><SUP> (114)</SUP></A>   But then he decided his prospects might be better elsewhere, so he
moved to Stillwater, Minnesota in 1881.  Thee he married Lila Jenkins in 1883 and practiced
law in Stillwater until 1888 when he moved his family to St. Paul, where he continued his
career as a lawyer.  His first  two children were born in St. Paul,  Gail Louise in 1889 and  
Earl in 1891. Then  Lila died in 1894, leaving Frank as a young widowed father.  That was
when Henry and Augusta moved to St. Paul to help him  care for the two little children.  <A HREF="#N_115_"><SUP> (115)</SUP></A>
They took Augusta's 82 year old mother, Sarah Willis, with them. That didn't turn out very
well because Henry died of stomach cancer in August of that same year.  A year later Frank
had his mother, his grandmother, and his two brothers; Arthur and Sidney, living in his
household.   Earl and Louise were being cared for in the home of young woman, Carrie
Lawson, living in the same neighborhood.. <A HREF="#N_116_"><SUP> (116)</SUP></A>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  It must have been a terrible time  for your
grandfather.  He married Julia Ewing two years later in Taylors Falls, where Julia, and her
sister, Anna, were spending the summer.  <A HREF="#N_117_"><SUP> (117)</SUP></A>  <A HREF="#N_118_"><SUP> (118)</SUP></A>You have guessed that since they were both
Methodists, they might have met in church.  </SPAN></P>


<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	About a year later, Frank's grandmother, Sarah Willis, died in St. Paul.  She is buried
there in Oakland Cemetery.   And since she is the your most recent of your Willis-named
ancestors to die, this is where I shall end my talk with you.  I have said enough.  Now I will
encourage you to continue trying to learn what you can from stories of your ancestors.  And
no matter how much you learn, there will always be more to discover.</SPAN></P>

English Origin of Deacon John Willis in April, 2009.   A John Willis was born in Chettle Parish, Dorsetshire,
about 1600 or 1610.  A  John Willis, age 29, came to New England on the ship "Paul" which sailed from
Gravesend London, England 3 Apr 1635, a claim  also asserted by   Warrington Willis, "Certain Willises and
Their Wives." and by  the  Dorchester Atheneum, ( <A HREF="http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=520)">http://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/page.php?id=520)</A>     
A John Willis has been said to have been certified by the minister of St. Kathrins "nere to Tower of London,"
before sailing to New England. There is a church in London called "Saint Katherine By the Tower."  The
church register shows the christening of a Johy Wyllis 4 Oct 1601, son of Richard Wyllis.  (4) A  John Willes
was christened 23 May 1610 at St. Botolph Bishopsgate, son of  Thomas Willes.  (5) A John Willis was born
in 1610 the son of Thomas Willis who was born in 1575 in Fenny Compton, Warwickshire, England.  (6) A
John Willis was born 1630 in Halford, Warwickshire, England, the son of Thomas Willis..</SPAN></P>

Amariah Dana, then 37 years old, was one of the "Green Mountain Boys" with Ethan Allen at the
taking of Fort Ticonderoga on   May 10, 1775, a year after the Boston Tea Party.   Just how and
when Amariah developed his relationship with Ethan Allen is not clear.   But it may well have
been related to Amariah's problems with the New Hampshire Grants.    The "Green Mountain
Boys"  formed as a reaction to  New York making grants of land  already settled by other settlers
who had received their land grants  between 1749-1764, from New Hampshire's Governor
Benning Wentworth   who assumed that the Province of New Hampshire extended to a line
drawn northward from the western boundaries of Connecticut and Massachusetts. (Sources -
Chittenden, Lucius E.  "Annual  Address Before the Vermont Historical Society Delivered at
Montpelier, VT, Oct 8, 1872" Rutland, Tuttle, &amp; Co.)   As one of the grantees, Amariah Dana 
probably found  title of his land disputed - leading to Amariah eventually joining Ethan Allen's

town...Whereas at a Chh Meeting Aug 27, 1789.  We unanimously judged you to be guilty of
injustice and Fraud in keeping a part to yourself of what was charitably bestowed on Seth Willis
of this town and committed to your care to deliver to him: which crime with the aggravated
circumstances of it was committed by you about the middle of Jan. 1789, as set fort hin the
Complaint exhibited to us against you by our Brother Newcomb Cleveland, on the 7<SUP>th</SUP> July, 1789,
and at the above said Meeting of Aug 17, was in our view, proved against you by full and
impartial evidence or evidences: and at the same time you was unanimously judged by us to be
guilty of equivocating, evading, and departing from the truth in the above said trial, and whereas
we have, as we hope, kindly and faithfully admonished you once and again of this your
wickedness, also used all that forbearance, lenity, and candour, and tryed every method with you
which our holy profession requires: and you still remain obstinate; and in your pretended
Confesstion which you sent in to us dated Sept 11, 1789 appear to us to plead innocent as to your
conduct to Seth Willis: your obstancy and inpenetency for your above named wickedness also
appears in your neglecting to attend publick worship with us at the House of God...This therefor
is, in the Name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, wholly to cut you off from all Christian Fellowship of
Chh priveledges with us, and finally to give you up, and consider you as an heathen man and
publican: or have us kind of friendly society of communion with you, till you manifest a spirit of
humiliation and repentance according to the nature of your offences, or until you give Christian
satisfaction to us, to the publick, and to Seth Willis whom you thus injured.  We are persuaded
that faithfulness for the honor of the Redeemer's cause, faithfulness for your immortal interest,
and faithfulness in bearing publick testimony against every publick injury to the4 cause of the
poor and indigent; justifies us in proceeding with you in this last, and so painful act of
Excommunication; which duty of our is so clearly enhoined on us in God's word.  And if you are
not wholly past feeling this, we humbly trust, must awaken a sense of conviction in you, and
work repentance in you; and for this we greatly long you in the bowels of Jesus Christ:  We
therefor must leave you in the hands of that God whose Grace is all sufficient; hoping that we
shall ever pray both in probate and in publick for you, that you may be recovered, and your
precious soul saved in the day of the Lord.  Humbly believing yet what we bind on Earth shall be
bound in Heaven, which God grant for Jesus sake.  Amen.....  The Chh being together this day
July 11, 1790 and unanimously voted the above to be their act and proceeding against the
aforesaid Eli Metcalf: that it be Recorded among the Ch Records; and that a copy of it be sent to
the Offender.  Also unanimously voted that it be read publickly or before the whole Congregation
on the sabbath and that a copy of it be sent to the Rev. Pastor of the Chh at Northampton, for him
to read to said Chh and Congregation if he shall think proper... By order of the Chh... Josiah
Spalding, Pastor..... A copy of the above was delivered to Eli Metalf in the presence of Mr.
Garner, his neighbor, Aug 17, 1790.... Pr me J. Spalding, Pastor."   Church records, Worthington,
