It is a French translation of the Latin histories written and updated by the monks of Saint-Denis, who were, from the thirteenth century, official historiographers to the French kings.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> The French text that these monks produced incorporated information from contemporary vernacular chronicles and was structured differently from its Latin model. As first written, the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> traced the history of the French kings from their origins in Troy to the death of Philip Augustus in 1223. With subsequent additions drafted first at Saint-Denis and then at the court in Paris, the chronicle took its final form, describing a chain of royal lives from the fall of Troy to the reign of Charles VI in the 1380s. Copied and amended for a variety of royal and courtly patrons, it survives in approximately 130 manuscripts. Because the <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> originated at Saint-Denis, the center of royal historiography, it had a quasi-official status that distinguished it from other vernacular histories and accounted for its popularity.</p><p class="normal">The study of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> has traditionally fallen between two areas of inquiry. Until recently, those interested in the historiography of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries concentrated primarily on Latin texts. They paid little attention to the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , which they<sup class="ref">[2]</sup> considered a "simple" translation of the Latin chronicles. Scholars interested in fifteenth-century historiography generally saw the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> as outdated and passed over its continuations in favor of other fifteenth-century sources.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> Rarely was the chronicle viewed on its own terms as an original creation whose audience differed from that of the Latin chronicle and whose illustrated text was edited and restructured.</p><p class="normal">Historiographical researchers have begun to reexamine the importance of the vernacular in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and, as a result, propose a different understanding of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Gabrielle Spiegel's ongoing analysis of the origins of French vernacular historiography traces the political forces that gave rise to the vernacular tradition in France and describes the distinct literary form forged for vernacular history during the thirteenth century.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> Serge Lusignan and Nicole Pons have studied the selection of Latin or French (or Latin <i>and</i> French) as a literary language in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,<sup class="ref">[5]</sup> providing a context for the origins and development of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> and revealing the audience as a determiner of the textual form and of the language.</p><p class="normal">Indeed, as Bernard Guenée's analysis of the diffusion of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> shows, the study of audience provides one avenue for understanding the popularity of the chronicle in the Middle Ages. Guenée demonstrates that, for the first 150 years of the <i>Grandes Chroniques's</i> existence, its audience was carefully circumscribed.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> Its readership was centered in the royal court at Paris, and its owners included French kings, members of the royal family, members of the</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">xx</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">court, and a few clerics in northern France. During this period, no copies of the work belonged to members of the Parlement or the university community.</p><p class="normal">One of the most important—and distinctive—features that the French chronicles of Saint-Denis provide their audience is a program of illustration; unlike the Latin compendia of the thirteenth century that the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> translated, most copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> were decorated with miniatures. Scholars seeking to describe the creative rather than the derivative aspects of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> have overlooked its pictorial cycles,<sup class="ref">[7]</sup> yet, from the earliest copy of the chronicle presented to King Philip III in 1274 to the copies produced by Parisian booksellers in the early fifteenth century, most manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> were illustrated with widely differing cycles that vary in number, subjects, and style.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup> Of the approximately 130 surviving manuscripts, over 75 have pictorial cycles, ranging in size from 1 miniature to more than 400 miniatures. The illustrations of the <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> offer a rare insight into the creation and dissemination of the royal image in Paris during the tumultuous era in French history when the Valois kings succeeded the Capetians and the Hundred Years' War began. The changes in imagery in copies of the chronicle from the late thirteenth through the early fifteenth century make clear the importance of these political events and the questions about legitimacy that they raised.</p><p class="normal">Because the illustrated cycles in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> vary from manuscript to manuscript, a monographic study of an exceptional version would do little to clarify the aggregate function of the illustrations. Yet a comprehensive analysis of all the illustrated exemplars of the text would be unwieldy. This book aims for the middle ground, covering 5 royal and 15 nonroyal manuscripts that exemplify different pictorial solutions to the problem of illustrating the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . I chose these books after examining 100 of the 131 manuscripts of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> that I have located. In order to provide readers with background for my observations and a guide to sources for further research, I have included at the end of the book a Catalogue of Manuscripts dating from 1274 to c. 1420 (coordinated for easy comparison of individual illustrations to specific texts) and appendixes that provide a chronological list of copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , as well as lists of the names of known owners of the manuscripts and of artists who decorated them.</p><p class="normal">To explore the role that pictures play in directing a reading of the chronicle, I examine their function in their text and their cycle of illustration. By comparing cycles of illustration in various copies of the chronicle, and by considering the manuscripts within the broader contexts of artistic production and contemporary literature and politics, I hope to place primary emphasis on the structure of cycles and the pictorial content of individual manuscripts and to dispel the notion of a standard pictorial or textual edition.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup> My research suggests that such an approach can provide valuable insights into the uses of history and the perceptions of kingship in France during the late Middle Ages.</p><p class="normal">This book is arranged chronologically and structured to compare chronicles belonging to the king to those belonging to members of the royal circle. These two groups had differing relationships to the history recorded in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Contemporary events played a major role in determining the illustrations of the past in royal and princely books. Indeed, royal copies of the chronicle</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">xxi</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">often used pictures to reshape the past to reflect present interests and suggest a new reading of history. This sense of active participation in the interpretation of history is probably the most significant difference between the illustration of royal and noble versions of the <i>Grandes Chroniques. Grandes Chroniques</i> manuscripts produced for the nobility contain less historical interpretation in the illustration and more expression of a popular sentiment for the monarchy, the <i>religion royale</i> .</p><p class="normal">The Introduction describes the origin and development of the text of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , which I interpret as a manifestation of Louis IX's political ideology. It then sketches the relationship of the text to contemporary vernacular historiography and to its Latin predecessors. The remainder of the book concentrates on the manuscripts themselves. Part One analyzes the cycle of the first royal <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> and contrasts its function as a Mirror of Princes with that of courtly chronicles from the first decades of the fourteenth century produced for the nobility and of a chronicle commissioned from a Parisian <i>libraire</i> in 1318. Part Two concentrates on manuscripts executed between 1330 and 1345 during the reigns of the early Valois kings; it contrasts the cycle in King John the Good's newly revised copy with a series of contemporary manuscripts decorated by the Master of the <i>Roman de Fauvel</i> for members of the nobility, manuscripts that show the strength of the <i> religion royale</i> in the early stages of the Hundred Years' War. The subject of Part Three is Charles V's manuscript, the first royal book to break from the tradition of a Mirror of Princes and forge an explicitly politicized vision of history. This section describes how Charles's book, the first to contain the account penned at court by Chancellor Pierre d'Orgement, was continued over a period of years and updated by illustrations and interpolated text specifically grounded in the political events of Charles's reign, additions that never reappeared in subsequent copies. Part Four concentrates on manuscripts produced during the reign of Charles VI, the last French king to reign in Paris before the English interregnum. Perhaps because there was little direct royal patronage for manuscripts while Charles VI was king, most illustrated copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> produced during his reign were conservative. One group made by Parisian booksellers for the nobility shared a concern for the celebration of the <i> religion royale</i> popular since the early fourteenth century, and a second group sought to guide Charles VI with a new kind of mirror for kingly behavior. Only a few books were innovative; in response to the absence of royal leadership, manuscripts painted for members of the court by the Master of the <i>Cité des Dames</i> offered creative representations of the past.</p><p class="normal">The turbulent reign of Charles VI is a logical endpoint for this study because production of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> ceased for a time in Paris from Charles VI's death in 1422 through Charles VII's exile and the regency of the duke of Bedford for the English king, Henry VI. By the time Charles VII was restored to the throne and production resumed in the mid-fifteenth century, the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was no longer current because the last event it recorded had occurred in 1381. It therefore lost its position as official history.</p><p class="normal">By the late fifteenth century the audience for the history recorded in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> had changed, and Paris was no longer the sole center for its production. Copies produced after the reign of Charles VI were therefore perceived, illustrated, and used differently. The problems posed by these copies</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">xxii</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">are very different from those raised by books produced during the first 150 years of the text's existence and will thus be sketched only briefly in the concluding chapter.</p><p class="normal">From the late thirteenth to the early fifteenth century, the Parisian audience, to which the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> appealed as a quasi-official history of France, commissioned illustrated copies that differed as much from one another as did their individual patrons. Although illustrations may not have played as vital a role as text in forming the political outlook of the <i> Grandes Chroniques's</i> owners, our perception of the political culture of late medieval France is enriched by analyzing these pictures in the contexts of artists' production, patronage, contemporary literature, and historical events. Because the pictorial cycles of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> frequently reflect the political attitudes of the manuscripts' owners, they document the different perceptions of kingship engendered by the chronicle. Moreover, in a few special cases, they provide commentary on contemporary events. The illustrations to the <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> thus provide additional insight into the impact of vernacular history on its readers.</p><p class="normal">I am pleased to acknowledge the generosity of many scholars during the time that I have worked on this topic: François Avril, Joan Diamond, Bernard Guenée, Gilette Labory, Gilbert Ouy, Nicole Roccati, Gabrielle Spiegel, and Patricia Danz Stirnemann. Elizabeth A. R. Brown and Walter Cahn read earlier versions of the book; their thoughtful criticism improved it. Sandra Hindman, the supervisor of the dissertation that forms the core of my study, deserves special thanks for the guidance she gave as I wrote my dissertation and the advice, encouragement, and friendship she has continued to provide in the years since I finished it.</p><p class="normal">Numerous grants and fellowships supported my work on <i>The Royal Image</i> . The Samuel H. Kress Foundation funded the research for my dissertation, the first stage of this book. Subsequent research, revision, and expansion of the text were made possible by a summer Grant-in-Aid (in 1985) and Fellowship for Recent Recipients of the Ph.D. (in 1987) from the American Council of Learned Societies, and by a J. Paul Getty Postdoctoral Fellowship in the History of Art and the Humanities (in 1987–88). The book is being published with the generous support of an Arnold O. Beckman Research Award from the Research Board of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p><p class="padded">Finally I would like to thank my husband, John, for his good will, generosity, and humor, and my daughter Jacquelin, for the joy she brought as I worked on this project.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">xxiii</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2><p class="noindent">I would like to thank the following people and institutions for providing photographs and permission to reproduce them: Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery: figure 97; Berlin, Deutsche Staatsbibliothek: color plate 8 and figures 102, 105, 110, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, and 118; Brussels, Bibliothèque Royale Albert Ier: color plate 2 and figures 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 109, 121, 122, and 123; Cambrai, Bibliothèque Municipale: figures 16 and 17; Castres, Bibliothèque Municipale: color plate 3 and figures 26, 27, 52, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, and 68; Mr. J.

Because of its place of origin, the chronicle has been interpreted as an attempt to make the facts of French history accessible to those who could not read Latin.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> Although this was certainly one motivation, the literary structure and content of the chronicle clearly shows that Primat, the monastic author-translator, deliberately wrote a new history, based on a Latin Dionysian (from Saint-Denis) compilation but supplemented by information drawn from the newly emerging tradition of vernacular prose history. To understand how the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> helped shape the royal image in France, it is therefore essential to examine the historiographic tradition of Saint-Denis and the tradition of regional vernacular historiography. Further, because the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was commissioned during the reign of Louis IX, the chronicle must be considered in the light of Louis's political ideology.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">Louis IX's Political Ideology</h3><p class="noindent">Recent studies of French political thought suggest that Capetian ideology, of which the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is an important manifestation, was firmly established by the mid-thirteenth century.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup> During Louis IX's reign, members of the court and of the abbey of Saint-Denis blended ideas first formulated among a handful of chroniclers and poets in the circle of Louis's grandfather, King Philip Augustus, into a coherent theory of kingship. Louis's saintly personality and dedication to the Crusades earned him a reputation in Europe as a preeminent Christian king.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> Those close to Louis IX built upon his saintly reputation by promoting the concept of Christian kingship through expressions of royal power such as ceremonials, artistic commissions, and the text of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Although few of these expressions can be connected directly to Louis's patronage, they embody ideas about the special nature of French kingship that were important to his government.</p><p class="normal">The French king was presented as the <i>rex christianissimus</i> in the ceremony of coronation, three versions of which were elaborated during the reign of</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">2</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">Louis IX: the <i>Ordo</i> of Reims, c. 1230; the <i>Ordo</i> of 1250; and the Last Capetian <i>Ordo</i> (the <i>Ordo</i> of Sens), c. 1250–70.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> As early as the <i>Ordo</i> of Reims, the ceremony contributed to the development of the mythology of kingship by stressing the origin of the holy oil with which the French king was anointed, oil thought to have been miraculously delivered by God at the baptism of Clovis, the first Christian king of France. Among the prerogatives given the king to reinforce his special status was the right to take communion of both bread and wine, a privilege normally restricted to the priesthood. Ideas about sacred monarchy expressed in the <i>Ordo</i> of Reims were developed further in the Last Capetian <i>Ordo</i> , which stressed that the French king was the "only one among all kings to be consecrated with heaven-sent oil." This <i>ordo</i> , probably used from Philip III through Philip of Valois, helped define the special nature of French kingship.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup></p><p class="normal">The ordination of the French kings at their coronation gave them the miraculous power to cure scrofula, the "king's evil," in a second ceremony celebrating France's Christian kingship. Cures of illness by the king's touch are recorded as early as the reigns of Philip I and Louis VI, but after its first mention in a monastic treatise of the early twelfth century the royal practice of touching for the "king's evil" was not clearly discussed in chronicles or accounts until descriptions of the reign of Louis IX were written.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> These descriptions indicate that Louis IX's reign marked, if not the revival of the practice, at least its increased visibility in midthirteenth-century France, and they clearly demonstrate that Louis possessed the power to heal because he was king of France, not because he was saintly.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup></p><p class="normal">Louis's artistic commissions also promoted the holiness of French kingship. The Sainte-Chapelle, built to house newly acquired relics of Christ's passion, was dedicated in 1248, just before Louis set out on his first crusade. Its stained glass program places an unusual emphasis on Old Testament kingship, including Louis as the only king from the Christian era.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup> Commissions such as the Old Testament Picture Book (Pierpont Morgan Library, M. 638) merge Old Testament history and French kingship in an even more sophisticated way. Through secularized representations of royal actions in Old Testament stories, they infuse biblical action with contemporary resonance; in the process, biblical history becomes more secular and French royal history more sacred.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup></p><p class="normal">Later in Louis IX's reign, royal commissions centered more frequently on French kingship without the mediation of Old Testament models. Thus coins struck during Louis's monetary reforms in the 1260s associated the king's shield with the cross and the legend "Christus vincit, Christus regnat, Christus imperat," an assertion of Louis's sovereignty that presented him implicitly as Christ's representative on earth.<sup class="ref">[10]</sup> Since the barons were forbidden to copy Louis's <i>écu d'or</i> , these coins became a powerful symbol of his monarchy.</p><p class="normal">Similar attitudes toward the French monarchy are evident in commissions undertaken by the monks at Saint-Denis. In a move Louis surely approved in the 1260s, the abbey translated the bodies of several kings and queens of France to elaborately sculpted tombs arranged around the crossing of the abbey church.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup> This arrangement celebrated the genealogical continuity of the French ruling house, the descent of French kings from Merovingians to Carolingians and, through Louis VIII and Philip Augustus, from Carolingians to Capetians. The proximity of the royal tombs in the church to those of Saint Denis and his companions also attested to the special relationship between the French house and</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">3</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">France's patron saint. French kings therefore appeared in a privileged position suited to their status as "most Christian," a status that would be impressed upon all the pilgrims who came to the abbey church to visit the graves of the martyrs.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup></p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">The Tradition of Regional Vernacular History</h3><p class="noindent">The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was only one of many vernacular prose histories that appeared in France in the early thirteenth century.<sup class="ref">[13]</sup> Precursors of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> , such as the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle (c. 1200–30), the chronicle of the Anonymous of Chantilly (c. 1210—30), the <i>Chronique des rois de France</i> by the Anonymous of Béthune (before 1223), and the <i> Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i> of the Ménestrel of Alphonse of Poitiers (before 1260), were regional or national histories written specifically for a lay audience ignorant of Latin.<sup class="ref">[14]</sup> They served purposes different from those of the Latin universal chronicles favored by monastic audiences or the <i>chansons de geste</i> of the nobility.</p><p class="normal">Authors of the earliest vernacular histories emulated existing genres of French literature such as the epic.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup> In the thirteenth century, however, they consciously changed the narrative structure of vernacular history, distancing it from that of the epic, to give more credibility to the stories recounted in the chronicle.<sup class="ref">[16]</sup> In the process, historiographers forged a new French literary language to convey a "literature of fact."<sup class="ref">[17]</sup></p><p class="normal">Among the early French histories, the <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> is the preeminent example of this "literature of fact." Adapting the language and form of vernacular history, Primat translated the Latin chronicles preserved at the abbey of Saint-Denis in the 1270s and drew upon contemporary French histories such as the Anonymous of Chantilly's <i>Chronique des rois de France</i> and the Ménestrel of Alphonse of Poitiers's <i>Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i> to write a royal history that displaced earlier examples of the genre by the early fourteenth century.<sup class="ref">[18]</sup></p><p class="padded">The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was written near Paris, the seat of French government, for a Parisian audience consisting of the king and those who worked closely with him. Unlike such vernacular histories as the French Pseudo-Turpin chronicle, whose origins in northern France and Flanders were noble and perhaps antiroyal,<sup class="ref">[19]</sup> the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is a quintessentially royalist text. It is therefore a good vehicle for studying the creation and development of the royal image in court circles between the late thirteenth and the early fifteenth centuries.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">The Latin Chronicle Tradition at Saint-Denis</h3><p class="noindent">The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> took its present shape over a period of 100 years, during which the monks of Saint-Denis translated into French the Latin chronicles that they had compiled.<sup class="ref">[20]</sup> From the time of the first copy, dated around 1274, until the mid-fourteenth century, the task of continuing the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was entrusted to the abbey. Drawing on rich Latin and vernacular traditions, Primat, the original monastic author-translator, produced a French text that traced the history of the French kings from the fall of Troy through the reign of Philip Augustus. He added elements from contemporary vernacular histories to a translation of writings that had been assembled in Latin anthologies by Dionysian compilers as</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">4</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">early as the first quarter of the thirteenth century: the Latin histories of Aimoin of Fleury, Sigebert of Gembloux, Einhard, Pseudo-Turpin, Hugh of Fleury, the continuator of Aimoin, and Guillaume of Jumièges.<sup class="ref">[21]</sup> Primat interwove these Latin and vernacular sources in a genealogical frame, producing a sequence of royal biographies that for the most part began with the king's coronation and ended with his death.</p><p class="normal">As his primary Latin source, Primat used an anthology (B.N. lat. 5925) made at Saint-Denis in the 1250s. He placed the French texts in the same order as many of the Latin ones and incorporated marginal notes from that manuscript, which he may have written himself to comment on and correct its text.<sup class="ref">[22]</sup> Like the earliest translator of the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle, Primat modified and supplemented this source.<sup class="ref">[23]</sup> He edited it; added translations of texts such as the Latin <i>Descriptio qualiter</i> (designed to authenticate relics owned by the abbey) and the life of Louis VII, neither of which was present in B.N. lat. 5925; clarified portions of his translation from Latin by comparing it to contemporary vernacular chronicles; and smoothed over transitions between the disparate elements that made up the Latin manuscript.<sup class="ref">[24]</sup></p><p class="normal">Primat also structured his <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> differently from the Latin anthology. As the arrangement of decorated initials, rubrics, and chapter lists in these manuscripts makes clear, the Latin compendium was designed to present a collection of histories with their individuality preserved, whereas the first <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Ste.-Gen. 782) was conceived as a unified whole. In the Latin manuscript large decorated initials reinforce the originality and autonomy of component parts, marking Aimoin's <i> Epistula in librum de gestis Francorum ad Abbonem abbatem</i> (fol. 1), Aimoin's preface to the <i>Historia Francorum</i> (fol. IV), the four books of Aimoin's <i>Historia Francorum</i> and the <i> Gesta Dagoberti</i> (fols. 6, 19, 34V, 69V, and 73), the <i>Vita Caroli Magni</i> by Einhard (fol. 123), the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle (fol. 132), the <i>Gesta Ludovici Pii imperatoris</i> (fol. 149V – followed by shortened lives of his successors), the prologue to the <i>Vita Ludovici VI Grossi regis</i> and the <i> Vita</i> (fol. 199V), and the prologue to the <i>Gesta Philippi Augusti</i> and the <i>Gesta</i> (fols. 248V–249V). Primat chose to omit the two longer passages that preceded Aimoin's history and the prologues that set apart the lives of Louis VI and Philip Augustus. Further, he prefaced each book (except that describing the life of Louis VII, which came from another source) with chapter lists. Primat also added a prologue and subdivided the text of B.N. lat. 5925. Thus the life of Charlemagne was divided into five books and that of Philip Augustus into three; the life of Charles the Bald was made into a single book.<sup class="ref">[25]</sup> As we shall see, many of Primat's new subdivisions were reinforced by illustrations, perhaps to draw special attention to those portions of the text.</p><p class="normal">Because B.N. lat. 5925 was a <i>recueil</i> , it contained no prologue to the work as a whole. Primat integrated part of the proem of Aimoin's Latin chronicle with which B.N. lat. 5925 began (fol. 6), with an edited version of the prologue of a contemporary vernacular history commissioned by Louis IX's brother, the <i> Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i> by the Ménestrel of Alphonse of Poitiers. To these he added material of his own to shape a royalist reading of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[26]</sup></p><p class="normal">Primat's prologue is most telling when it departs from its models. Certain additions and omissions reveal the bias of the Dionysian historiographer. Whereas</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">5</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">the Ménestrel of Alphonse of Poitiers enumerated diverse sources for his text—ranging from lives of saints to "a book which describes the <i>gestes</i> of the French kings which is at Saint-Germain-des-Près"—Primat listed only the chronicles of Saint-Denis.<sup class="ref">[27]</sup> Similarly, Primat stressed genealogy to a greater extent than did the Ménestrel, perhaps because of Saint-Denis's role as royal necropolis.<sup class="ref">[28]</sup> Some changes in the Ménestrel's prologue clarify the didactic purpose and audience of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> : Primat declared that the king and princes "with lands to govern" should "profit from the example of history."<sup class="ref">[29]</sup> Still other alterations introduce a common literary topos in which the translator who has undertaken the work at the request of his patron humbly begs the pardon of his readers for the inadequacy of his translation.<sup class="ref">[30]</sup></p><p class="normal">Primat used a paragraph from Aimoin's Latin proem as a transition from the Ménestrel's text to Primat's largest original contribution to the prologue. Although Aimoin's <i> Epistula</i> and <i>Praefatio</i> were included in B.N. lat. 5925, their subject matter was too specific for the prologue to the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> ; the <i>Epistula</i> was addressed to Aimoin's abbot, and the <i>Praefatio</i> described the customs and institutions of Gaul and Germany.<sup class="ref">[31]</sup> Primat used the most generalized portion of Aimoin's <i>Proemium</i> , a text following the preface, which celebrated the prowess, fame, and devotion of the ancient Franks.<sup class="ref">[32]</sup> Primat's adaptation first mentions the Trojan origins of the French, then discusses the ferocity with which the French fought their enemies and the mercy with which they treated their subjects, and concludes with a description of the reverence that inspired the French to convert to Christianity.<sup class="ref">[33]</sup></p><p class="normal">This description of the French people provides a smooth transition to Primat's major addition to the prologue: two long passages that reinforce themes of holiness and seem to relate specifically to the political ideology of Louis IX's court. The first passage describes France's special role as defender of the church; it stresses the holiness of the French nation in an elaboration on Aimoin's description of the ancient Franks.<sup class="ref">[34]</sup> Primat then tells why France merits her special status: first, because Saint Denis protects France and, second, because Paris is the center of learning "by which the holy church is sustained and enlightened," having moved to France from Greece and Rome—an event referred to as the <i> translatio studii</i> .<sup class="ref">[35]</sup> These original passages end with a prayer that God maintain learning and chivalry in France.<sup class="ref">[36]</sup></p><p class="normal">Primat's additions to the prologue draw attention to the genealogy of the French kings, but they also praise the holy nation that the kings govern under the protection of Saint Denis. Indeed, by juxtaposing his reference to the <i>translatio studii</i> with the prayer that follows it, Primat suggests that France and her kings must strive continually to merit their special status in the eyes of God.<sup class="ref">[37]</sup> Thus Primat's own additions to the prologue cast the chronicle in a didactic, even moralizing, frame; they lead readers, whether royal or noble, to anticipate a history of the holy kingdom of France and its most Christian kings that will provide models for their own behavior.</p><p class="normal">The additions to the prologue, the interpolations of texts like the <i>Descriptio qualiter</i> and the life of Louis VII, the use of vernacular histories to clarify and expand the text, and the restructuring of the Latin source (B.N. lat. 5925) demonstrate Primat's intention to shape a history for a vernacular audience. Three of his</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">6</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">changes in particular distinguish the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> from other works. First, the revised structure of the French text, reflected in book divisions and decoration, pays increased attention to the lives of Charlemagne, Charles the Bald, and Philip Augustus. Second, the language of the translation is more "objective" than that of the contemporary vernacular histories that Primat used as sources. Third, original additions to the prologue place the text that follows squarely within the framework of Louis IX's royal ideology. The following chapters consider whether the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> 's illustrations, the most obvious additions to this vernacular chronicle, were equally innovative.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">7</span> ―</div><h1 class="Heading-Heading2">PART I—<br /> THE FIRST ILLUSTRATED COPIES OF THE <i>GRANDES CHRONIQUES</i></h1><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">9</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter One—<br /> Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i></h2><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">Contemporary Representations of Kingship at the Court and the Abbey of Saint-Denis:<br /> Precedents for the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i></h3><p class="noindent">Dionysian and courtly commissions, rather than other vernacular histories, provide precedents for the cycles of decoration in the earliest copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . In view of the origins and patronage of the translation of the chronicle, this is not surprising. Because the French translation of the Latin chronicles of Saint-Denis began during Louis IX's reign, the earliest manuscript (Ste.-Gen. 782) must be considered with other commissions focusing on kingship that were produced for the saintly king and his successors. Further, because the text of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was translated by Primat, a monk of Saint-Denis, and the illustrations of the presentation manuscript were probably planned with the advice of Primat or Abbot Matthew of Vendôme, the pictorial cycles in the earliest <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> are analogous to those commissions by the abbey or the court under the supervision of the abbey. The pattern of courtly and monastic commissions in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries demonstrates how depictions of kingship were shaped by patronage and colored by self-interest.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading4">Kingship in the Royal Context</h3><p class="noindent">The fortunes of the Capetian house flourished during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. When the first copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was decorated shortly after the death of Louis IX in 1270, the Capetians were in firm control of France. By the reign of Philip the Fair (1285–1314), France was the dominant power in Europe, able to challenge and defeat even the pope. Although the last Capetians, Louis X (1314–16), Philip V (1316–22), and Charles IV (1322–28), were troubled by a dearth of male heirs, the institution of the monarchy remained powerful.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup></p><p class="normal">Popular commissions responded to the concerns of the reigning king. Before Saint Louis, references to French kingship were couched most frequently in terms of the biblical antecedents of the French monarchs, the kings of Judah.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup> Depictions of kings from the Old Testament mingled with those of queens and prophets in jamb statues, such as those at Saint-Denis and Chartres; later, sculpted</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">10</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">Old Testament kings predominated in the galleries on the facades of cathedrals.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> Galleries of kings may have been more explicitly dynastic; as early as the thirteenth century, literary references document the popular perception that the statues in the gallery of Notre-Dame represented kings of France.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup></p><p class="normal">Ceremony and art dealing more specifically with the king also associated biblical with French kingship. One of the most important ceremonies to do this was the French coronation, versions of which were drafted around 1230 and again around 1250.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup> The sculpture of Reims cathedral, the site of the royal coronation, commemorates in more durable form the equation of Old Testament and French rulers expressed in the words of the coronation ceremony. Thus on at least one level, the interior facade of Reims is, as Sadler has shown, a collection of biblical <i>exempla</i> directed to the newly crowned king.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup></p><p class="normal">Pictorial programs focusing on kingship evolved during the reigns of the last Capetians. Early commissions executed for Louis IX continued to portray kingship in terms of Old Testament models. For instance, artists depicted biblical scenes in a group of Parisian monuments in manuscript and stained glass executed for Louis. These emphasized human rather than divine action and concentrated primarily on Old Testament kings.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup> The changed subject matter and new narrative style in these cycles invested religious history with a "new prescriptive force" to become an example for royal behavior.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup> After Louis's canonization in 1297, hagiographic programs, frequently presented within a dynastic framework, became more common at court.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup> The presence of a royal saint allowed subsequent rulers such as Philip III or Philip the Fair to glorify the royal house by promoting the cult of their saintly forebear.<sup class="ref">[10]</sup></p><p class="padded">During the reign of the last Capetian kings, royal commissions, whether biblical, hagiographic, or dynastic, manifested concern with legitimacy and dynastic continuity.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup> Increasingly, courtly commissions emphasized the continuous succession of the three races of French kings, a succession whose length and holiness, confirmed by the sainthood of Louis IX, were the subject of the <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading4">Kingship in the Dionysian Context</h3><p class="noindent">Throughout the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the fortunes of the abbey of Saint-Denis were closely connected to those of the Capetian kings.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup> As early as the twelfth century, Abbot Suger succeeded in weaving together the destinies of France and the abbey. He acted as regent while Louis VII was on crusade; secured the privileges of guarding the coronation regalia and the <i>oriflamme</i> , the official standard of the French kings; and established the abbey as the burial place for France's rulers.</p><p class="normal">Subsequent abbots followed Suger's lead in promoting Dionysian involvement in France and the king's involvement in the abbey. Abbot Matthew of Vendôme (1258–86) acted as regent when Louis IX was on his second crusade and handled the day-to-day administration for Louis's successor, Philip III.<sup class="ref">[13]</sup> Perhaps at the request of Louis, this same abbot gave visual expression to the abbey's role as royal necropolis by commissioning an extensive tomb program.<sup class="ref">[14]</sup> The deliberate interweaving of abbey and realm continued during the tenure of Giles of Pontoise (1304–26). He had been sponsored for the abbacy by Philip IV, had</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">11</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">acted as a royal councillor, and was an executor of Philip's will. In his commissions Giles of Pontoise continued the long-standing tradition of presenting the French ruler with objects that glorified his kingship and demonstrated the special role of the abbey in royal history.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup> Throughout this period the abbey's royal programs seem to have had a consistent aim: to combine self-promotion with promotion of the royal house. Programs aimed at a larger audience as well as those geared to a single viewer, the king, demonstrate this consistency of purpose.</p><p class="normal">Two Dionysian commissions of the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries exemplify this merging of self-promotion and royal promotion in the abbey's patronage. The program of tombs completed by Matthew of Vendôme in 1267 glorified kingship but also aimed to secure the rights of Saint-Denis over private foundations like Royaumont as the burial place for French kings.<sup class="ref">[16]</sup> Similarly, the presentation copy of Ivo of Saint-Denis's <i>Vita et Passio Sancti Dionysii</i> (B.N. fr. 2090–92 and B.N. lat. 13836), commissioned during the reign of Philip IV by Giles of Pontoise and given to Philip V around 1319, combined a <i>vita</i> of Saint Denis with a chronicle stressing his miraculous interventions in French history. This text was intended to reawaken royal devotion to Saint Denis as much as to promote kingship.<sup class="ref">[17]</sup></p><p class="padded">Although these commissions consistently promoted the abbey, their portrayal of kingship and their dynastic content developed over time. The arrangement of tombs changed after the death of Louis IX and again after his canonization, evolving away from the original schematic demonstration of the origins of the Merovingian, Carolingian, and Capetian kings of France and their relationships to one another. The addition of a gilded tomb for Louis IX sometime before May 1282 affirmed his importance, as did Philip IV's directive in 1306 that the bodies of four Carolingian rulers and Philip III and Isabella of Aragon be moved to make room for his own tomb next to that of Saint Louis. In the process the tombs' program shifted from celebrating the succession of dynasties to concentrating on Louis IX, France's holy king.<sup class="ref">[18]</sup> Similarly, when the presentation copy of Ivo of Saint-Denis's <i>Vita et Passio</i> was prepared for Philip V, its text was translated and miniatures were added to reflect the special importance dynastic themes held for Philip.<sup class="ref">[19]</sup> Similar royal and Dionysian preoccupations influenced the development of cycles of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> .</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">The Copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques<br /></i> Presented to Philip III:<br /> A Mirror of Princes</h3><p class="noindent">The earliest surviving <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Ste.-Gen. 782) is a luxurious manuscript commissioned around 1274 by the monks of Saint-Denis for presentation to Philip III, who had succeeded his father, Louis IX, in 1270.<sup class="ref">[20]</sup> It contained the newly translated vernacular version of the chronicles of Saint-Denis and 36 miniatures and historiated initials. Parisian artists who had undertaken commissions for Louis IX decorated the book.<sup class="ref">[21]</sup> Any analysis of its cycle of decorations must consider these circumstances of production.</p><p class="normal">Such an analysis must also consider the hierarchy of decoration, the scale and positioning of miniatures in relation to one another, and the relationships between text and illustration. Such an approach refines previous interpretations</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">12</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">and shows that the content of the pictures in this chronicle is closer in tone to contemporary Dionysian cycles than to royal cycles commissioned by Louis IX or Philip III.</p><p class="normal">The iconography of Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is particularly inventive. Although the pictures in this new text employ diverse models, they transformed them into a focused program. For instance, a compositional pattern for a battle scene employed as a shop model in the stained glass of Saint-Denis (for the capture of Nicaea by the crusaders) and of Chartres (for the capture of a Spanish city) was adapted to represent Philip Augustus's capture of Le Mans (fol. 295).<sup class="ref">[22]</sup> In this case, the adaptation does not seem to have influenced the content of the scene. Parisian artists who worked in varied media used this model to represent any number of battles.</p><p class="normal">Some pictorial models may, however, have been more closely tied to their original texts. The clearest example of this is the Dream of Charlemagne (see Fig. 5), which illustrates a portion of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> translated from the chronicle of Pseudo-Turpin. The two scenes chosen for Philip III's manuscript are similar to those selected for such early monuments based on the text of the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle as the thirteenth-century <i> châsse</i> of Charlemagne at Aix-la-Chapelle. As in the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> , this image combines the vision of the starry sky with the appearance of Saint James. The illustration of Saint James appearing to Charlemagne in the beginning of the Latin Pseudo-Turpin chronicle in the twelfth-century <i>Codex Calixtinus</i> and its fourteenth-century copies is also similar.<sup class="ref">[23]</sup> Although these earlier monuments form part of a rich visual tradition based on the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle—a tradition within which the image in Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> belongs—the precise relationship between the illustration in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> and the earlier tradition is difficult to establish. Because the events represented in each image are described in both the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle and the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , the similarities between the <i>châsse, Codex Calixtinus</i> , and the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> may be coincidental.<sup class="ref">[24]</sup> Artists may have arrived at their visual formulations independently.</p><p class="normal">The most sophisticated use of models in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> occurs in the adaptation of imagery from one text to illustrate another, as in the frontispiece of the chronicle. The first chapter of Book I of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> concentrates on tracing the genealogy of the French from Francion, the mythical son of Hector whose descendants founded France, whereas the picture that illustrates it concentrates on the rape of Helen. The beginning of the genealogy, which describes how Priam, ruler of Troy, sent his son Paris to Greece to avenge a slight committed by the Greek king, provided an opportunity to insert the frontispiece: Paris's vengeance was the abduction of Helen. The text of the chronicle goes on to describe the siege and destruction of Troy by the outraged Greeks and to tell how the few survivors of the city scattered all over the world.<sup class="ref">[25]</sup></p><p class="normal">Only the first part of this brief Trojan account is illustrated in the frontispiece (Fig. 1).

According to the prologue, the chronicle is to be a "mirror of life" in which "each person can find good and evil, beauty and ugliness, sense and folly, and profit in everything through the example of history."<sup class="ref">[29]</sup></p><blockquote><p class="noindent">And because there have been three generations of kings in France since it all began, this history will be divided into three principal books: where the first will speak of the generation of Meroveus, the second of the generation of Pepin, and the third of the generation of Hugh Capet. Each of these books will be subdivided into diverse books, according to the lives and deeds of diverse kings; ordered by chapters to understand the material more easily and without confusion. The beginning of this history will be taken at the noble line of the Trojans from whom it [the French line] is descended by long succession.<sup class="ref">[30]</sup></p></blockquote><p class="normal">At the end of Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> a special French poetic colophon, rarely copied in later manuscripts, addresses Philip directly.<sup class="ref">[31]</sup> Developing one theme sounded in the prologue—that of learning from the deeds of prior kings—it informs Philip that the manuscript was made for him to study and read in the hope that he would be a wise king. According to the poem, Philip should emulate the deeds of the good kings recorded in the chronicle and shun the example of the bad.</p><p class="normal">In their focus on the education of a young ruler these passages tie the chronicle to a newly forming tradition, the Mirror of Princes, a genre of political literature that remained popular throughout the Middle Ages.<sup class="ref">[32]</sup> Although Mirrors of Princes took varied forms, ranging from poetry to scholastic prose, they shared a royal audience and a content designed to teach a prince to govern with sound moral principles. The Capetian court of Louis IX, which probably provided the impetus for the translation of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , played an important role in generating and consuming this type of political literature.<sup class="ref">[33]</sup> Indeed, the prologue and poetic colophon establish a reading of the chronicle that is consistent with our knowledge of Louis IX's use of history; Joinville, one of Louis's biographers, describes how the king told his children stories of past rulers to give them examples to follow and avoid.<sup class="ref">[34]</sup></p><p class="normal">The miniatures of presentation that illustrate the prologue and poetic colophon frame the cycle of pictures in this manuscript and work with their texts to establish how the book should be read. In the first picture (Fig. 3), a kneeling monk humbly presents the chronicle to the king. The second picture (Fig. 4), the largest in the manuscript, transforms the presentation that inaugurates the chronicle, just as the poetic colophon elaborates themes presented in the prologue. In this two-column miniature the king is still enthroned and in his regalia, and Primat still presents his book, but Matthew of Vendôme rather than the king dominates the scene. Supervising the presentation, the imposing abbot stands so tall that the king must look up at him, and he and his monks occupy two-thirds of the picture's space. This miniature calls attention to the giving of the gift rather than its reception, and it suggests that the voice in the poem below it is Matthew's.<sup class="ref">[35]</sup> In doing so it celebrates the abbot's role in guiding Philip III and the important historiographic work done by Matthew of Vendôme and his monks.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">16</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00002.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 3<br /> Presentation of book to Philip III. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Ms. 782, fol. 1.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Paris.</p><p class="normal">The distribution of miniatures in the chronicle proper does not follow the simple pattern established by the textual divisions. Primat's translation of the Latin chronicle is laid out as a series of books, all but one of them (the life of Louis VII) preceded by chapter lists: five books tell of the Merovingians and of Pepin (the first Carolingian); five books recount the exploits of Charlemagne; two describe Charlemagne's first two descendants—Louis the Pious and Charles the Bald; one records the lives of the later Carolingians and of the Capetians up until Louis VI; one each is dedicated to Louis VI and Louis VII; and three report the deeds of Philip Augustus.<sup class="ref">[36]</sup></p><p class="normal">The miniatures in Philip III's manuscript are of two types. Larger, columnwide miniatures mark the beginnings of books describing the lives of the Merovingian rulers, the imperial Carolingians (Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, and Charles the Bald), and Philip Augustus. Smaller historiated initials decorate books and chapters that Matthew of Vendôme must have perceived as less important to Philip III—those that record the lives of the last Carolingians and all Capetian rulers except Philip Augustus.

Others relate more closely to the dynastic frame, the succession of races, also described in the prologue. Still others intertwine the histories of France and the abbey of Saint-Denis. As will become clear, all these themes are interdependent, so that the pictures weave together the textual themes of good kingship, dynastic continuity, and historical identity between France and Saint-Denis.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading4">Models of Kingship</h3><p class="noindent">The Trojan frontispiece and the subcycles of the lives of Charlemagne and Philip Augustus shed light on the ideals of kingship promoted in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> given to Philip III. A comparison of the frontispiece with its probable model and of the illustrations of the lives of Charlemagne and Philip Augustus with the subsequent tradition helps to pinpoint consistent aims in the cycle.</p><p class="normal">As discussed earlier, the frontispiece of the first copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> emphasizes the Trojan ancestry of the French kings.

Except for its opening miniature, the subcycle of the life of Charlemagne resembles early cycles of his life based on the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle and is typical of later cycles in the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[37]</sup> Nonetheless, the repetition of the figure of Charlemagne in scenes from his life attracts the reader's attention. Thus the dream of Charlemagne encompasses two scenes (Fig. 5): in one the king first sees the vision of the starry road, and in the other Saint James appears to explain it to him. In the miniature of Charlemagne's coronation (Fig. 6) two images invert the relationships between the emperor and the pope. In the upper scene the church is supreme, and Charlemagne kneels to be crowned emperor in Rome at the hands of the pope; in the lower scene the state takes priority, and the pope pleads with Charlemagne to commute the sentences of those condemned by the emperor for degrading the pontiff.</p><p class="normal">Although these scenes derive directly from the chronicle's text, they depart from it in one important visual detail—they emphasize Charlemagne's kingship</p><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00004.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 5<br /> Charlemagne has vision of the starry sky; Saint James<br /> appears to sleeping Charlemagne. <i> Grandes Chroniques<br /> de France</i> . Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Ms. 782, fol.<br /> 141. Photograph: Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">19</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">rather than his imperial status.

It was employed primarily to justify territorial expansion.<sup class="ref">[42]</sup> In the popular imagination, reflected in <i>chansons de geste</i> of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Charlemagne's empire was equated with the kingdom of France: 170 passages in the <i>chanson de Roland</i> make this equation.<sup class="ref">[43]</sup></p><p class="normal">In the late thirteenth century, when this manuscript of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> was produced, the association of France with the empire and the French king with the emperor seems to have had a different use. Despite, or perhaps because of, a botched attempt to secure the imperial crown, Philip III placed more emphasis on defining the limits of French kingship than on claiming the empire.<sup class="ref">[44]</sup> Political texts produced during his reign consistently underscore the French king's sovereignty—he is <i>princeps in regno suo</i> who "takes his power from no one except God and himself" (<i>le roy ne tient de nului fors de dieu et de lui</i> )—without any reference to the empire.<sup class="ref">[45]</sup></p><p class="normal">The identification of the French king with Charlemagne in a ceremony described in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> further strengthened French kingship. Philip was the first king to use Charlemagne's sword, <i>Joyeuse</i> , in the ceremony of coronation, thus emphasizing Charlemagne's role as ancestor of the French kings.<sup class="ref">[46]</sup> Certainly, the portrayal of Charlemagne as a French king in the illustrations of Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was deliberate and, moreover, compatible with his consistent political posture.</p><p class="normal">Illustrations of the life of Philip Augustus are equally important in this manuscript, both as models of kingship for Philip Augustus's namesake and possibly as a further means of associating Philip III with Charlemagne. The hierarchy of decoration in the manuscript, as well as one particularly powerful miniature, mark this segment of the text with a special subcycle.</p><p class="normal">A historiated initial of the king enthroned begins the chapter list, and three miniatures illustrate the life of Philip Augustus. Only Philip Augustus's life has a historiated initial mark the chapter list, and miniatures rather than historiated initials illustrate the account of his reign—the first in the manuscript since the histories of the early Carolingians. Doubtless Philip Augustus alone of the Capetians receives such attention in part because he held a special place in the thoughts of Philip III. Philip Augustus was presented along with Saint Louis as a model for Philip III, as, for instance, in the dedication verses to Guillaume de Nangis's <i>Life of Saint Louis</i> .<sup class="ref">[47]</sup> Other writings from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries describe Philip Augustus as one of the first of a series of holy kings to rule France.</p><p class="normal">The first miniature of Philip Augustus's life (Fig. 7) suggests this king's holiness and miraculous birth: Christ swoops down from behind a cloud to present a young crowned king to Louis VII and his wife, who kneel in prayer with representatives of a cross section of society. This image is more emblematic than narrative. Instead of illustrating Louis VII's Christological vision (Philip Augustus giving the barons blood to drink from a chalice) or the actual birth of an heir—images that became canonical illustrations for this text in later copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> —this miniature focuses on Philip's sobriquet, <i> Dieudonné</i> .

The text describes how the king, his queen, and all the clergy and people of the realm prayed for the birth of a son. God heard their prayers and gave them Philip, a son whom Louis "nourished healthily and introduced plainly in the faith of Christ and the commandments of the holy church" and whom he had crowned at Reims when he was "of appropriate age."<sup class="ref">[48]</sup></p><p class="normal">The portrayal of Philip as a crowned child holding a scepter contradicts part of the narrative; he was not crowned until he was 14 years old. Indeed, Philip's dress alludes to Louis VII's prayer, also recorded in the chapter, in which Louis requests an heir to rule: "Lord, give me a son, heir of my body, noble governor of the realm of France."<sup class="ref">[49]</sup> This boy clad in the attributes of kingship comes in answer to the prayer of the king and the populace for a "governor." The picture thus celebrates both the birth of Philip Augustus and the God-given kingship of France.</p><p class="normal">In this manuscript Philip Augustus and Charlemagne not only provide Philip III with distinct models for French kingship, but are also associated with</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">22</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">each other. This connection is emphasized by the layout of the cycle of decoration. A reader coming upon the group of miniatures illustrating the life of Philip Augustus might well recall that Charlemagne was the last ruler in this manuscript to have such a cycle.</p><p class="normal">Textual evidence provides further reasons for associating Philip Augustus with Charlemagne. The most famous text to do so is the <i> reditus regni ad stirpem Karoli Magni</i> , the prophecy that seven generations after the usurpation of the French throne by Hugh Capet, France would be returned to a ruler of Carolingian descent.<sup class="ref">[50]</sup> In this copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , discussion of the <i>reditus</i> is limited to a small paragraph at the beginning of Hugh Capet's life which states that Philip Augustus married Elizabeth of Hainaut expressly to recover the line of Charlemagne.<sup class="ref">[51]</sup> In later copies of the chronicle an expanded discussion of the <i>reditus</i> appears at the beginning of the life of Philip Augustus's son, Louis VIII, who fulfilled the prophecy because he was descended from the Carolingians on both his mother's and father's sides.<sup class="ref">[52]</sup> Perhaps because Louis's life was not included in Philip III's manuscript, Philip Augustus is presented as the prime agent of the <i>reditus</i> .</p><p class="normal">The <i>reditus</i> affected Primat's translation of his sources. In describing the second coronation of Philip Augustus, which took place in Saint-Denis in 1180 during his marriage to Elizabeth of Hainaut, Primat transformed his Latin source, a text by Rigord, by explicitly referring to Charlemagne. The Latin text described how Elizabeth's uncle, Philip of Flanders, carried a sword with honor before the king; Primat's version speaks of "Philip of Flanders, who on this day carried <i>Joyeuse</i> , the sword of the great king Charlemagne, before the king as is right and customary at coronations of kings."<sup class="ref">[53]</sup></p><p class="padded">These visual and textual references to Charlemagne and Philip Augustus are provocative because they may echo Philip Augustus's identification with Charlemagne, voiced most explicitly in the <i> reditus</i> . Primat's interpolation, moreover, may have been an attempt to establish a precedent for Philip III's use of Charlemagne's sword in his coronation and to strengthen the identification between Philip III and his great Capetian ancestor Philip Augustus. Mention of the sword <i>Joyeuse</i> was probably intended to recall Charlemagne, Philip Augustus's illustrious predecessor, and to refer to Philip III, his namesake who also used Charlemagne's sword in the ceremony. Thus both text and pictures present Charlemagne and Philip Augustus to Philip III as dual models of kingship.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading4">Dynastic Continuity</h3><p class="noindent">Other illustrations in Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> develop the dynastic theme of the prologue. These merge, yet differentiate, the sequence of Merovingian, Carolingian, and Capetian rulers that stretches back to Troy, and in the process they celebrate the legitimacy of the Capetians and of Philip III.</p><p class="normal">Two historiated initials break the pattern of illustrations in the first portion of the manuscript to address the transfer of government from Merovingian to Carolingian. The first (Fig. 8) portrays the coronation of Chilperic II, in a chapter that begins with a rubric, "Ci commence li fait du noble prince Charles Martel," which directs attention away from Chilperic to the mayor of the palace, Charles Martel.

In this section historiated initials subdivide several chapters outlined in the chapter list. The clusters these form again imply that a transition of dynasties is a reward for good government. A sequence of scenes in one chapter creates a precedent for Capetian rule. In the first cluster (Fig. 10) Normans invade France because the Carolingian king, Charles the Simple, is too young and too weak to govern. In desperation the barons turn to the mayor of the palace, Odo Capet, and crown him king (Fig. 11). Odo governs but remains loyal to young Charles. As soon as Odo dies and the realm reverts to Charles the Simple, the political situation degenerates. The Normans invade again, only to be driven from the realm by the duke of Burgundy (Fig. 12). A second cluster of historiated initials represents the chaos that preceded Hugh Capet's accession to the throne. A sequence of three historiated initials shows the coronation of Louis V, the last Carolingian king (Fig. 13); the conflict between Louis's uncle, Charles, and Hugh Capet's army, which broke out because Hugh would not accept Charles's succession (Fig. 13); and the resolution of the crisis—Hugh Capet, descendant of Odo and, like Odo, mayor of the palace,</p><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00009.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 10<br /> Invasion of the Normans. <i>Grandes<br /> Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque<br /> Sainte-Geneviève, Ms. 782, fol. 208v.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Sainte-<br /> Geneviève, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">25</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">becomes king (Fig. 14).

Such legitimacy can be confirmed by blood, as the <i>reditus</i> suggests, but it is not necessarily created by it.<sup class="ref">[56]</sup> This view seemed to be foremost at Saint-Denis from the 1260s to 1280s, for it shaped other commissions, including the large sculpted tomb program for the abbey church and the Latin guide to the tombs written by Guillaume de Nangis.<sup class="ref">[57]</sup> The combination of distinct lines unified by the <i>reditus</i> in the tombs and in the Latin <i>Abbreviated Chronicle</i> supports my interpretation of Philip III's program of decoration. All three—the tombs, the Latin chronicle, and the pictorial cycle of Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> —trace the lines of office of the French king and note each spot where succession based on good government and succession based on blood diverge. But in each the careful documentation of genealogical discontinuity is secondary to the celebration of continuity of the long line of good governors. This continuity was confirmed by the <i>reditus</i> , which reunified legitimacy of blood with legitimacy of succession to office in the Capetian descendants of Philip Augustus.<sup class="ref">[58]</sup></p><p class="normal"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00010.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 11<br /> Coronation of Odo Capet. <i>Grandes<br /> Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque<br /> Sainte-Geneviève, Ms. 782, fol. 208v.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Sainte-<br /> Geneviève, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">26</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00011.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 12<br /> Normans driven from France by the duke of Burgundy. <i> Grandes Chroniques de<br /> France</i> . Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Ms. 782, fol. 209. Photograph by the author.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">27</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00012.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 13<br /> Coronation of Louis V; Army of Charles of Lorraine puts to flight that of Hugh Capet. <i> Grandes<br /> Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Ms. 782, fol. 219. Photograph by the author.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">28</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00013.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 14<br /> Hugh Capet pardons the count of Flanders.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Ms. 782, fol.<br /> 219v.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, Paris.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading4">The Royal House and the Abbey of Saint-Denis:<br /> A Shared History</h3><p class="noindent">The impetus toward self-promotion characteristic of commissions sponsored by the abbey of Saint-Denis explains the presence of one rare miniature in this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . The illustration for the first book of the life of Charlemagne comprises two scenes (Fig. 15). In the lower register, Childeric III, the last Merovingian king, is deposed and forced to enter a monastery.<sup class="ref">[59]</sup> Above this scene Pope Stephen II crowns Pepin, the first Carolingian ruler. Perhaps in an attempt to feature the coronation at Saint-Denis in which the pope took part, the composition in this miniature inverts the narrative structure common to every other multitiered miniature, in which the story unfolds from left to right and from top to bottom. This is therefore a specially tailored image whose subject does not recur in any later cycles.<sup class="ref">[60]</sup></p><p class="normal">Although dynastic interests account in part for the inclusion of the miniature of Pepin's coronation, the history of Saint-Denis may explain its prominence. Because the ceremony took place at Saint-Denis, it was as much a part of the history of the abbey that produced the text as it was of the king who received the manuscript.<sup class="ref">[61]</sup> The illustration of Pepin's coronation served as a reminder to the king of the intertwined history of the abbey and the French royal house.</p><p class="normal">Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is a carefully crafted text decorated by illustrations that clarify the chronicle's dynastic and Dionysian content.

These observations may explain why this pictorial cycle spawned no progeny despite its presence in the royal library at the Louvre.<sup class="ref">[62]</sup> Because Philip's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was commissioned for a special audience at a particular time, its pictures tailor the reading of the text to suit the needs of both Philip III and the abbey of Saint-Denis.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">30</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter Two—<br /> Manuscripts Produced during the Reigns of the Last Direct Capetians</h2><p class="noindent">Manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> produced during the reigns of the last Capetians are simpler in conception than is Philip III's book.

Indeed, it is difficult to determine whether the pictures in many of these books were intended to shape a reading of the text. It is unclear whether the events highlighted by pictures were important to a specific patron, whether they were selected for him, or whether they were prepackaged by the editor before a patron arrived. Yet there are ways of coming to grips with the cycles in these manuscripts. Once the late Capetian manuscripts have been examined carefully, certain books reveal affinities with courtly and royal programs from the reign of Philip IV.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">Genealogical Manuscripts</h3><p class="noindent"><i>Libraires</i> producing many of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> for the court adapted their illustrations to portray one of the many themes that shaped Philip III's manuscript: dynastic continuity.

The chronicle in Cambrai includes the French and Latin dedication poems that appear in Philip III's <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> and in three later manuscripts, one of which belonged to Charles V.

On the basis of style, Avril dates the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in Paris to 1315–20, an attribution that is supported by a textual interpolation that provides a <i>terminus post quem</i> of 1315.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup></p><p class="normal">In planning illustrations for these manuscripts, the <i> libraires</i> took their cue from the portion of the prologue that describes the genealogy of the French kings. The pictures repeat basic patterns, emphasizing enthroned rulers in the chronicle in Cambrai and coronations in the manuscript in Paris. The cycle from the Cambrai manuscript is the simpler. Its historiated initials, which mark normal divisions in the text, contain enthroned kings holding either swords or scepters, as for instance in the picture of Clovis (Fig. 16). The only deviation from the pattern occurs at the beginning of the third book of the life of Charlemagne (Fig. 17), where an emperor holds an orb and a scepter to commemorate Charlemagne's imperial coronation.</p><p class="normal">The cycle decorating the Paris manuscript is structured on the same principle but executed with greater sophistication.

In this manuscript reigns of kings form textual units, and as a result the density of illustration varies radically. For instance, illustrations of the coronations of Louis III, Odo Capet, and Charles the Simple (fols. 140–141) break what normally constitutes the seventh chapter of the life of Louis the Stammerer into three segments. In other parts of the manuscript many folios separate miniatures. Thus the sequential miniatures illustrating the coronation of Louis the Pious as co-emperor by Charlemagne (fol. 90v) and the coronation of Louis the Pious as emperor (fol. 115) are 25 folios apart.</p><p class="normal">The iconography of the Paris book's cycle of illustration was carefully coordinated before the gatherings were given out to at least nine different artists.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup> Each scene incorporates details drawn from its text. Thus when the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> lists three of the king's brothers attending his coronation, the miniature includes them.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup> The designer of the manuscript even elaborated the text on occasion by using elements drawn from conventions of representation to identify characters.

These, like B.N. fr. 2615 and Cambrai, B.M. 682, also reject the <i>reditus</i> as a structuring principle for representations of dynastic kingship. The series of <i> montjoies</i> , or markers, erected on the road between Paris and Saint-Denis was an early and public example of such a dynastic program.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup> In place from the late thirteenth century, these monuments were identical in type: each was topped by a cross and decorated by fleurs-de-lis, and each contained three niches filled with generalized representations of French kings who varied in pose from one monument to the other.

The most notable courtly commission of this sort was the decoration of the Grande Salle of the Palais de la Cité under Philip IV. There a series of labeled polychromed statues portrayed French kings from Pharamond to Philip himself.<sup class="ref">[13]</sup> Contemporary descriptions make clear that these were perceived as commemorations of the office of king. In the 1320s Jean de Jandun described the statues in terms of succession to office: "For the honor of their glorious memory, the statues of all the kings of France who occupied the throne up to the present are gathered in this place. Their likeness is so expressive that at first glimpse one would believe they were alive."<sup class="ref">[14]</sup></p><p class="normal">Philip IV's commissions at Saint-Denis also concentrated on royal succession rather than the sequence of dynasties or the <i> reditus</i> . In 1306 Philip IV ordered the tombs at Saint-Denis rearranged to move his and his parents' tombs to the Carolingian side of the choir. This change merged the division of ruling houses that had been so carefully established in the 1260s.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup> Although some scholars interpret the rearrangement as an attempt to place Philip III's and Philip IV's tombs close to that of their holy ancestor, Louis IX, it also blended the lines so that the overwhelming impression on a visitor to the abbey would be comparable to that of Jean de Jandun when he faced the sculpture of the Grande Salle of the Palais de la Cité.</p><p class="normal">Royal taste for the emphasis on the long line of kings eventually affected Dionysian commissions. During the reigns of Philip IV and his sons even the monks of Saint-Denis abandoned the <i>reditus</i> as a means of structuring royal succession. A telling example is the third portion of Ivo of Saint-Denis's <i> Vita et Passio</i> (B.N. lat. 13836), part of a manuscript commissioned by Philip IV but presented to Philip V c. 1319.<sup class="ref">[16]</sup> This book merged the histories of France and Saint-Denis by appending at the end of Saint Denis's <i>vita</i> a historical compilation decorated by pictures of enthroned kings woven into a genealogical framework that is much more explicit than that of any contemporary copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .</p><p class="normal">Marginal notes in a 1330s version of the <i>Vita et Passio</i> preserved at the abbey of Saint-Denis (B.N. lat. 5286) contribute to a reconstitution of the pictorial program in the manuscript presented to the king.<sup class="ref">[17]</sup> Several of these notes refer to images in the king's book that present special models of kingship in Charlemagne and Saint Louis or stress the importance of the French house.<sup class="ref">[18]</sup> One image in particular could have been included in the king's book only for dynastic reasons.

This book was commissioned from Thomas of Maubeuge, a noted Parisian <i>libraire</i> , by Pierre Honnorez of Neufchâtel in Normandy.<sup class="ref">[22]</sup> Apparently Thomas based his manuscript on a copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> to 1223, which copies an <i>exemplaire</i> that seems to have circulated among Parisian booksellers until the early fifteenth century, and supplemented that text with Guillaume de Nangis's amplified chronicle for the lives of Louis VIII through Louis X.<sup class="ref">[23]</sup> To organize the text Thomas turned not to royal or courtly models of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> but to contemporary vernacular histories, specifically to the <i>Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i> by the Ménestrel of Alphonse of Poitiers, one of the texts whose prologue was adapted for the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[24]</sup></p><p class="normal">This copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is the only one whose text follows the tripartite division outlined in the section of the prologue taken from the Ménestrel's chronicle and used to structure manuscripts of that text. Thomas of Maubeuge did as the derivative section of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> 's prologue mandates: he divided the history into three principal books that deal with the "generations" of Meroveus, Pepin, and Hugh Capet. To clarify the organization of the text further, Thomas provided a genealogically structured table of contents in the first gathering, which was added after the manuscript was completed through the life of Louis X. Besides listing certain important passages and noting the folios on which they appear, the chapter list explains how to use the text when it is divided into three: "And to know how to find the generation by the number, you will find in the first generation on each page the number .i., in the second .ii., and in the third .iii. And thus you will find the things which are there."<sup class="ref">[25]</sup> Within each of the subdivisions of the text proper the pagination begins anew.</p><p class="normal">The earliest manuscripts of the <i>Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i> , dating from the thirteenth century, append genealogical trees that function like Thomas's genealogically ordered chapter list.<sup class="ref">[26]</sup> These diagrams distinguish the Merovingians, Carolingians, and Capetians from one another so clearly that few other illustrations are needed.<sup class="ref">[27]</sup> As a result, the <i> Abrégé</i> provided few pictorial models for Thomas. The textual relationship between these books therefore makes the independence of Thomas's illustrations even more noteworthy. Indeed, they differ distinctly from the few illustrated manuscripts of the <i>Abrégé</i> and from the copies of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> produced under courtly or Dionysian patronage. In selecting his pictures, Thomas seems to have forged an independent cycle—one that may provide insights into nonroyal uses of history in the early fourteenth century.</p><p class="normal">Directions to the rubricator and illuminator preserved in B.N. fr. 10132<sup class="ref">[28]</sup> suggest that the genesis of this pictorial cycle was similar to that described for contemporary romances. In romances verbal guides written as directions to the illuminator often indicated the subjects for illuminations and explanatory captions in the form of rubrics often summarized the chapters and explained their miniatures.<sup class="ref">[29]</sup></p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">38</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">In B.N. fr. 10132 this practice was limited to material derived from the first of the two textual models used for the portion of this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> finished in the 1320s.<sup class="ref">[30]</sup> Apparently Thomas used a fully rubricated copy of Guillaume de Nangis's amplified chronicle for the second portion of the manuscript describing events from 1223 to 1316, because that part has rubrics for every chapter and contains no marginal guides to the illuminator or rubricator. In contrast the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> to 1223 that Thomas used as a source for the first portion of the book seems not to have been fully rubricated. Because original rubrics and notes to the illuminator survive in that part of the manuscript, the creative process involved in emphasizing selected texts and images is most evident there.</p><p class="normal">With the exception of the fourth book of the lives of the Merovingians, which has rubrics for each chapter, rubrication is scattered in the portion of Thomas's text based on the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Not all illustrated chapters have rubrics, and not all rubricated chapters have illustrations. Nonetheless, selected cases in which a rare combination of directions to the illuminator and rubricator survives demonstrate how the <i>libraire</i> constructed the pictorial cycle.<sup class="ref">[31]</sup></p><p class="normal">These marginal directions were first published by Berger and Durrieu, who described the positions of the notes to the rubricator in the lower or side margins and the notes to the illuminator in the lower margins.<sup class="ref">[32]</sup> They suggested that the notes were written by two separate hands: the first, the scribe of the text and rubric, wrote notes for the rubricator, and the second wrote notes for the illuminator in a more cursive hand. Berger and Durrieu concluded that Thomas of Maubeuge's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was created through the successive intervention of three people: the copyist, who was also the rubricator; the director of the illumination; and the illuminator.</p><p class="normal">Gilbert Ouy's suggestion that the two sets of directions were written by the same hand employing different styles of script presents a different vision of the creation of the book in which at any given time one person was responsible for copying the text, writing the notes dictating the content of rubrics and subjects for illumination, and rubricating the manuscript.<sup class="ref">[33]</sup> Certain inaccuracies in the pictorial cycle support his observation. For example, on folio 256 (Figs. 22 and 23) the directions to the illuminator follow the notes to the rubricator in the lower margin. First is the note for the rubric that celebrates King Robert's descent from Hugh Capet and his scholarly bent, and second is the note for the illumination that describes how, with plenty of soldiers, he besieges a city.<sup class="ref">[34]</sup> It seems likely that someone wrote the note to the illuminator after completing the note to the rubricator; for that person the "he" of the illuminator's note was clearly King Robert, who had just been mentioned by name in the rubricator's note. Robert's identity was not so clear to the artist, who apparently read only the notes written in the script used for directions about pictorial content. He painted a generic scene of knights approaching a castle, rather than a king leading a siege.<sup class="ref">[35]</sup> When directions to the rubricator and the illuminator were not juxtaposed on the same folio, the scribe knew that the artist would not have seen the note to the rubricator and was careful to specify in the direction to the artist the presence of "the king" or "the emperor." The artists followed these directions, thereby producing more accurate representations of the events described in the chapter than those produced on folios where directions to the illuminator immediately</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">39</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00021.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 22<br /> Knights approach a castle. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque<br /> Nationale, Ms. fr. 10132, fol. 256. Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">40</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00022.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 23<br /> Notes to the illuminator and rubricator. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Nationale,<br /> Ms. fr. 10132, fol. 256. Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00023.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 24<br /> Battle of Charles of Anjou and Manfred.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 10132, fol.<br /> 371v.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">41</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">followed directions to the rubricator.

The treatment of pictures showing battles exemplifies the way in which the artist who followed the marginal notes tailored these stock scenes to fit various situations. The battle of Manfred and Charles of Anjou (Fig. 24) represents the basic composition—a confrontation between a king and a knight on ground defined by hillocks made of black and white swirls. Artists could add details to this basic image. Extra knights and portions of dismembered bodies appear in the battle of Charles of Anjou against Conradin and Henry of Spain (Fig. 25); in a miniature painted by this artist in a later copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Castres, B.M.) trees fill in the representation of a preliminary skirmish before the battle of Bouvines (Fig. 26), and a complement of knights aid Philip Augustus in that battle (Fig. 27). Although none of the instructions for these specific pictures survive, it is quite likely that the directions given the artist for each of these miniatures specified the representation of a battle and that he adapted a stock scene to fill the need.<sup class="ref">[36]</sup></p><p class="normal">The relation between the content of the illuminations and the rubrics that act as explanatory captions is revealing as well.

However, when directions to the illuminator are absent, pictures often illustrate more elaborate rubrics that function as captions. The most obvious examples of this occur in a sequence of four rubrics in Books I–III, which provide such detailed descriptions that they could function as directions to the illuminator, although only three are illustrated in B.N. fr. 10132. These captions differ from those given in the chapter list and in such earlier copies of the chronicle as Ste.-Gen. 782. They seem to have been part of a text that circulated among Parisian <i>libraires</i> , because they resurfaced in a number of late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[38]</sup></p><p class="normal">Although most images in this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> are composites assembled by the artist from stock compositions to illustrate written directions for "a battle," the cycle itself was carefully constructed. Indeed, the structure of this cycle of illustration differs distinctly from those that I have termed "royal" or "genealogical." The first two pictures in particular reinforce the preoccupation with dynasties exhibited in the tripartite division of text in this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . The first miniature depicts the destruction of and flight from Troy (Fig. 28). Its placement at the beginning of the prologue is rare, because the Trojan story forms part of the first chapter of Book I. A unique image derived from the iconography of the tree of Jesse (Fig. 29) displaced the Trojan image as an illustration for the first book of the chronicle. It shows a recumbent king from whom grows a tree bearing fruits that are crowned and uncrowned male heads.</p><p class="normal">The rubrics for these two pictures establish a relationship between them. A rubric under the illustration of the destruction of Troy is better suited to explain the tree: "Here begins a genealogy of the dukes who reigned before there was any king in France, and then, of the kings who reigned after them."<sup class="ref">[39]</sup> The image of the tree of descent shows the uncrowned heads (dukes) and crowned heads (kings) forming part of the same tree. Its rubric alludes to the destruction: "Here begins a genealogy of the kings of France and how they descended first from those who fled Troy."<sup class="ref">[40]</sup> The displacement of the Trojan scene to include the tree of descent at the beginning of Book I emphasizes the importance to this book of the length of the French line.

Because this image is unusual, a reader might interpret it as a deliberate visualization of a political prophecy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, this seemingly innovative picture was the easiest way to illustrate the text that follows it.

Both the pictorial cycle and the textual organization of this manuscript are very different from contemporary Dionysian, royal, and courtly programs. Thomas of Maubeuge was the only editor to be faithful to the division of the texts outlined in the prologue of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> and to attempt in the first few illustrations of the program to reinforce the prologue's dynastic message. Both the organization of the text and the paired introductory miniatures in this copy of the chronicle concentrate on the succession of the three races of French kings. Although the</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">47</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">rest of the cycle is less innovative, it is nonetheless an important source for examining aspects of the history that interested the broader audience who bought manuscripts from <i> libraires</i> . This chronicle manifests less concern with questions of dynastic succession than preoccupation with traditional French heroes. Unlike many royal and courtly manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , which were tied closely to royal self-perception and to the changing political situation in France, such apolitical manuscripts as that commissioned from Thomas of Maubeuge retained their popularity through the reigns of the early Valois.<sup class="ref">[46]</sup></p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">49</span> ―</div><h1 class="Heading-Heading2">PART II—<br /> DYNASTIC CHANGE AND THE REPRESENTATION OF HISTORY IN THE MID-FOURTEENTH CENTURY</h1><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">51</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter Three—<br /> Textual and Pictorial Innovation in John the Good's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i></h2><p class="noindent">Because the last Capetians left no male heirs, the Capetian and Valois kings during the first half of the fourteenth century were plagued by the problem of royal succession.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> When Louis X died in 1316, his wife was pregnant; his brother Philip, named regent for the duration of the pregnancy, became king when the newborn son died, because the treaty regulating the regency had laid the groundwork for the elimination of Louis's daughter from the succession. An assembly of barons confirmed Philip's selection in 1317. Philip V died without a male heir. He was succeeded by his younger brother Charles IV, who left a daughter and a pregnant queen at his death. Because of the precedent for female exclusion set in 1316, Isabelle, the sister of Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV, was not considered for the succession after her youngest brother died. The barons instead chose Isabelle's cousin Philip of Valois as regent, and when Charles IV's widow gave birth to a daughter, they declared Philip king in 1328.</p><p class="normal">Two claimants to the French throne, Edward III of England and Charles of Navarre, objected to this exclusion of women; each claimed succession through his mother—Edward III through Isabelle, sister of the last three Capetian kings, and Charles of Navarre through Jeanne of Burgundy and Navarre, daughter of Louis X. The English claim, pressed from 1337, constitutes one of the primary causes of the Hundred Years' War. The younger pretender, Charles of Navarre, began to maneuver for the throne only during the 1350s.</p><p class="normal">Although the conflict between England and France escalated during the reign of Philip of Valois, most of the attacks were aimed at Philip's descendants, particularly John the Good, Philip's heir when the Hundred Years' War began.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup> Perhaps because of his shaky status, John actively commissioned manuscripts, particularly political texts. His <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> , one of the earliest of his manuscripts, is therefore best seen in its political context.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup></p><p class="normal">The copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> produced for John the Good (B.L.

Whether commissioned by John or by someone close to him at court, the manuscript offers a rare opportunity to examine the ideal of kingship deemed appropriate for the young heir to the throne. Further, the dense marginal annotations provide insights into the maturation of John's political thought.</p><p class="normal">Although the text in John the Good's chronicle is structured essentially like that of Philip III's, its content differs. Like Philip III's chronicle, John the Good's is divided into a sequence of books, each of which (with the exception of Louis VII's life) is introduced by a chapter list. John's manuscript, however, continues the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> with lives of Louis VIII and Saint Louis, both without chapter lists.</p><p class="normal">The text in John's book was edited carefully by someone who went back to Primat's primary Latin source (B.N. lat. 5925) preserved in the library of Saint-Denis. Certain passages in the Latin manuscript were included without the corrections provided in Primat's French translation; other passages that Primat interpolated into his translation were omitted.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup> The compiler need not have been a monk of Saint-Denis, however, since he had access to such Parisian sources as the cartularies of Notre-Dame in Paris, which he used on at least one occasion to correct the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[8]</sup> Further, his translation of Saint Louis's life consistently suppresses remarks relating to the Abbey of Saint-Denis.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup></p><p class="normal">Most revisions in the body of John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> clarify the chronicle by specifying where events described in the text took place and by adding phrases like "près de Paris" to locate obscure places.<sup class="ref">[10]</sup> They also recommend further reading in the lives of saints for the history of the Merovingian rulers of France.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup></p><p class="normal">John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> apparently retained its status as an important translation throughout his reign. Later in John's lifetime, the text of this manuscript was revised a second time.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup> The primary source for this revision was once again the Latin compilation (B.N. lat. 5925) preserved at Saint-Denis. Delisle showed that the editor prepared for his revision of John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> by annotating B.N. lat. 5925 with cross-references to a historical manuscript from Saint-Germaindes-Près (now B.N. lat. 12711), references to the chapter divisions of the French chronicle, and French glosses about faulty translations in the text of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[13]</sup> After verifying the translation in John the Good's manuscript, the editor annotated it extensively in French; his work was written in a clear Gothic bookhand in the margins (see, for example, Fig. 42).</p><p class="normal">Delisle correctly suggested that the revisions must have been made at court because the editor had easy access to manuscripts from Saint-Denis, Saint-Germain-des-Près, and the royal library. According to Delisle, the editor was Pierre d'Orgemont, the chancellor of John's son, King Charles V, who is thought to have supervised the continuation of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in the 1370s during Charles's reign.<sup class="ref">[14]</sup> Delisle speculated that John's chronicle was annotated as a prelude to the production of Charles V's magnificent manuscript.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">53</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">Textual evidence, however, supports a simpler theory—that John the Good ordered the revision. Both the tone of the annotations and their subject are consistent with the initial translation done for John. Like the body of John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , the elaborate marginal annotations primarily retranslate Primat's Latin source. They thus share the concern for clarity and authenticity that informed John's manuscript in the 1330s and follow the same method of compilation. Moreover, Delisle's theory fails to explain why Pierre d'Orgemont would collate several manuscripts and annotate John the Good's chronicle in preparation for his work for Charles V only to turn to another textual model for the first portion of Charles's manuscript, Philip III's copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Ste.-Gen. 782), preserved in the royal library. Finally, the few cursive annotations in the margins of B.L. Royal 16 G VI do not support Pierre's authorship of the new translation. These notes were not written by the same hand (presumably Pierre d'Orgemont's) that covered the margins of the first <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> with cursive directions to the scribe of Charles V's manuscript.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup> The inescapable conclusion is that the editor of Charles V's book had little or nothing to do with the production of the chronicle preserved in the British Library.<sup class="ref">[16]</sup></p><p class="normal">The relation between the marginal annotations and the pictures in John's chronicle suggests that the marginalia were designed to enhance John's manuscript, not to prepare for a more authoritative version of the chronicle. Two annotations comment on miniatures to clarify the text. The first corrects faulty heraldry in a miniature from the life of Louis VI (fol. 301), which should depict Henry I of England sleeping with his arms at the ready but shows the arms of France rather than England beside the recumbent king. A referencing mark, :/, like those used to insert annotations, appears in the margin closest to the arms in the miniature, and above it ":/ Angleterre" is written in cursive. A second marginal note in Gothic bookhand explains an ambiguous picture in the life of Philip Augustus (fol. 362v), showing a king, presumably John of England, paying homage to Philip Augustus. The accompanying text describes a visit of the English king to France and recounts an incident in which King John failed to comply with Philip Augustus's request to come to Paris as a peer. The picture does not illustrate either incident. Apparently this confusion was evident to the annotator of John the Good's manuscript: he added a marginal note later in the same chapter, beside a text describing how Philip gave Arthur, the nephew of John, the counties of Brittany, Anjou, and Poitou, along with 200 knights and a sum of money, explaining the illustration with a phrase drawn from the Latin life of Philip Augustus: "King Philip received him [Arthur] perpetually in liege homage."<sup class="ref">[17]</sup></p><p class="normal">The iconography of Saint Denis also supports the Parisian provenance for the manuscript. Three scenes (fol. 183, Charlemagne prays at Saint-Denis; fol. 235v, Charles the Bald gives gifts to Saint-Denis; and fol. 302v, Louis VI prays at the abbey of Saint-Denis) include a distinctly Parisian representation of Saint Denis: Denis appears with all but the top of his head intact (Fig. 31). This image is in keeping with the assertion of the canons of Notre-Dame that they possessed the relic of the top of Saint Denis's cranium. First proposed during the reign of Philip Augustus, this claim was immediately contested by the monks of Saint-Denis and continued to be a subject of active debate into the fifteenth century when it came to trial before the Parlement of Paris.<sup class="ref">[18]</sup> If Royal 16 G VI were a gift to John from</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">54</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00030.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 31<br /> Charles the Bald presents gifts to Saint-Denis. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> British Library, Royal 16 G VI, fol. 235v. By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal">the monks, as Ste.-Gen. 782 had been to Philip III, it is doubtful that such imagery would have been included.</p><p class="normal">If we reject Delisle's theory that Charles V's chancellor directed the revision of this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , then the London chronicle takes its rightful place as an important example of John's literary patronage. Following the lead of his mother, Jeanne of Burgundy, John the Good commissioned numerous translations of religious books and politically oriented texts, many of which were densely illustrated.<sup class="ref">[19]</sup> The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> surviving in the British Library may well be one of the earliest of these commissions.</p><p class="normal">Pictures are integral parts of John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Almost every chapter has a miniature; 418 illustrations contain over 600 scenes. Curiously, this wealth of imagery has never been fully examined, despite its significant difference from all other royal copies of the chronicle. This neglect may be the result of John's image as a <i>chevalier</i> who loved the hunt, relished battle, and lived luxuriously,<sup class="ref">[20]</sup> a view that colored certain interpretations of his manuscript and led scholars to dismiss its pictures as derivative. Stiennon and Lejeune, for example, concluded that the</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">55</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">manuscript derived its cycle of Roland from <i>chansons de geste</i><sup class="ref">[21]</sup> and that its pictures did not even illustrate the chronicle. Historians of art have therefore restricted their analyses of this book to studies of style.<sup class="ref">[22]</sup></p><p class="normal">Yet the illustrative cycle of John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is never purely derivative but creatively modifies its sources, as demonstrated in its relation to Philip III's chronicle (Ste.-Gen. 782), which, as the only other copy of the text known to have been in the royal library, may have been a source, and to a historical and hagiographic text also preserved in the royal library, the <i> Vita et Passio Sancti Dionysii</i> of Ivo of Saint-Denis.</p><p class="normal">If the compiler of John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> consulted Philip III's book, he adapted only certain aspects of its pictorial layout. For example, in both royal manuscripts the lives of the imperial Carolingians (Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, and Charles the Bald) are more densely illustrated than other royal lives. Philip's manuscript, however, places great emphasis on the imperial Carolingians, thus associating Philip Augustus with the early Carolingians—particularly with Charlemagne—as royal models for Philip III. John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , on the other hand, does not involve the imperial Carolingians in a system of sophisticated pictorial cross-references but simply illustrates their texts and, through variations in scale and density, emphasizes themes already present in the chronicle. Most of the numerous illustrations to the lives of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, and Charles the Bald in John's chronicle concentrate on themes that provide appropriate models for his kingship: Charlemagne's military prowess and his piety. The fact that John took part in battle from an early age might explain why the seven pictures (fols. 141v, 143, 144, 145v, 147, 148v, and 149v) illustrating Charlemagne's campaigns in the second book of his life are two columns wide. Charlemagne's piety is a less common theme for a prince's book; nonetheless, John's manuscript contains a pair of double miniatures followed by a series of seven scenes in which Charlemagne in Constantinople receives the relics of Christ's suffering (fols. 159, 160), brings the relics home (fol. 161v), witnesses their miraculous properties (fol. 162v), and displays them to the populace at the fair of Lendit (fol. 163). Indeed, Charlemagne's recovery and adoration of Christ's relics are given more emphasis than the crusade by which they were acquired. Such an unusual combination of military prowess and religious devotion was doubtless intended to demonstrate the desired balance between worship and action in a Christian king.</p><p class="normal">The admonitions added to the text to look for more information in the lives of the saints were taken to heart in its program of illustrations. The pictures of John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> blend images drawn from a variety of hagiographic traditions into an integrated cycle that closely illustrates its text. For example, one particularly dense subcycle in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> relates to an illustrated saint's life preserved in both the Dionysian and royal libraries: the <i>Vita et Passio Sancti Dionysii</i> by Ivo of Saint-Denis.<sup class="ref">[23]</sup></p><p class="normal">Ivo of Saint-Denis's history, the third portion of the <i>Vita et Passio</i> , begins with the fall of Troy and ends in the reign of Philip V. Even though its structure, like that of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , follows a sequence of royal biographies, its content focuses on the role in French history of Saint Denis and the abbey that bears his name. Predictably, one of the fullest royal cycles in Ivo's historical</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">56</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">compilation illustrates the life of Dagobert, the royal founder of the abbey of Saint-Denis.</p><p class="normal">Dagobert's life is also the most densely illuminated of the Merovingian kings in John's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> ; five 2-column miniatures are among 14 pictures dedicated exclusively to Dagobert.

Two subsequent miniatures show why Dagobert needed to seek refuge at the tomb. In the third, Dagobert's tutor insults him, and Dagobert humiliates his tutor as a punishment (Fig. 34).

By stressing King Clotaire's exclusion from his son's refuge, John's chronicle shifts the focus away from Saint Denis's tomb—the center of attention in Ivo's Dionysian text—to the royal story, the relation between father and son.</p><p class="normal">As this small portion of the cycle of Dagobert's life demonstrates, the illustrative program of this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is independent of contemporary iconographical sources. The pictures of Dagobert's life are not simply quotations from preexisting, mainly Dionysian, cycles. They are free adaptations designed to focus attention on Dagobert. Indeed, the parallel scenes of Dagobert's hunt and sanctuary in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> are two of only five large scenes among the 14 minatures that illustrate his life. They are given large scale as an important early manifestation of Dagobert's special status, just as the last large miniature, in which Dagobert establishes his testament in conference (fol. 107), demonstrates the full fruition of his kingly wisdom as he provides for his succession.</p><p class="normal">Numerous other sources for the illustrations of John the Good's <i>Grande Chroniques</i> probably exist; Stiennon and Lejeune imply parallels with the</p><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00037.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 38<br /> Hunt of the stag. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British Library, Royal 16 G VI, fol. 92.<br /> By permission of the British Library.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">60</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00038.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 39<br /> Dagobert in sanctuary. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British Library, Royal 16 G VI, fol. 93v.<br /> By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal">illustration of romances, although this has not yet been proven.<sup class="ref">[25]</sup> Despite its numerous sources, however, John's chronicle is a carefully constructed whole in which the densest cycle of pictures to appear in any manuscript of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> complements a thoroughly revised and glossed text.

Crusading imagery and the representation of relics are carefully detailed in pictures that may have been timely responses to contemporary politics. If there is one overarching theme in the cycle as a whole, however, it is the celebration of France's God-given kingship, whose holy character was confirmed by the sainthood of Louis IX.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">Politics and the Problem of Succession</h3><p class="noindent">The illustration to the prologue and the changes to its text establish the theme of succession as central to John the Good's <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> . The prologue's miniature (Plate 1) is a nonnarrative image showing the coronation of an enthroned pagan king of France flanked by a pagan duke and two Christian rulers. Their costumes identify them: the duke wears a circlet, and the kings wear crowns adorned with fleurons; checkered patterns mark the robes of pagan rulers, and the fleur-de-lis, given to the French during the reign of Clovis, the first Christian king, distinguishes Christian rulers.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">62</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">The pagan duke stands on a pedestal to the left of the enthroned king, and the Christian kings stand on pedestals to the right. This arrangement suggests that they should be interpreted as the predecessor and successors of the king whose coronation is taking place. If this is the case, then the sequence of pagan duke to pagan king to Christian kings identifies the coronation as that of Pharamond, the first king of France.</p><p class="normal">To an audience familiar with the court, as readers of this royal manuscript would have been, this miniature must have recalled the sequence of sculpted kings, beginning with Pharamond, that decorated the Grande Salle of the royal palace. A change in the prologue reinforces the pictorial reference. Just after the description of the three lines of kings who governed France, John's chronicle modifies the phrase in the prologue, "The beginning of this history will be taken at the noble line of the Trojans from whom it [the French line] is descended by long succession," to read "is descended by succession of time."<sup class="ref">[27]</sup> Neither picture nor text places undue stress on the relationship of these rulers by blood. Both seem to celebrate instead the continuity of the office of king, to which the king is elected and in which he is supported by the barons who help place the crown on his head in the miniature.</p><p class="normal">These changes in image and text may have been timely responses to the difficulties created by the succession of the early Valois kings. In the late 1330s, when this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was produced, Edward III was the main threat to John the Good, claiming the French throne and waging campaigns against the French in propaganda and on the battlefield. Edward's claim, supported by his political and military maneuvers, helps to clarify the imagery of the introductory miniature and to reveal its relation to its text and perhaps to the rest of the cycle.</p><p class="normal">Edward's anti-Valois propaganda, which centered on John, the heir apparent, rather than his father, Philip, the first Valois king,<sup class="ref">[28]</sup> may well have begun before Edward claimed the kingship of France in 1337. As early as 1332 Philip anticipated a difficult succession and had his barons swear to support John should Philip die while on crusade. John's need for protection lasted through the 1340s; in 1347 his brother-in-law, Charles IV, the Holy Roman Emperor, promised to aid John if his succession were threatened.</p><p class="normal">In 1340 Edward's agents disseminated a poster containing a French translation of the Latin letter in which Edward claimed to be the legitimate heir to Charles IV, the last Capetian, who died in 1328, and assumed the royal style of King of France and England.<sup class="ref">[29]</sup> This translated letter, posted on church doors in northern France, was so inflammatory that Philip ordered all copies confiscated and all who posted it or permitted it to be posted imprisoned.</p><p class="normal">Edward's propaganda was so broadly disseminated that it affected the visions recorded in the late 1340s by Saint Bridget of Sweden,<sup class="ref">[30]</sup> an anti-French author often quoted by the English in their political writings. In one vision the Virgin Mary appeared to Bridget and contended that Philip was a legitimate king, since he had been selected by the barons of France and had not come to the throne by violence,<sup class="ref">[31]</sup> and should therefore rule France until his death. Many asserted, however, that Edward was closer to the inheritance of the throne than Philip and should be designated by Philip as his successor.<sup class="ref">[32]</sup></p><p class="normal">Such threats to John's legitimacy may explain why the prologue and its miniature present succession to the throne as a "succession of time" rather than</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">63</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">a succession of blood. Such an argument could be used to defuse English claims. Other portions of the cycle focus on the same themes as Edward's propaganda, celebrating descent from Saint Louis and the idea of a crusade, while promoting France's holy kingship.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">Saint Louis:<br /> The Model <i>Roi Très Crétien</i></h3><p class="noindent">Almost from the moment of his death, Louis IX became a model for royal behavior against whom subsequent kings were measured and often found wanting. Royal descent from Louis cut in two directions; while the canonization of a French king gave the Capetians proof that they were part of a line of <i>rois très crétiens</i> , Louis's life was a reproach to subsequent kings who, not gifted with sanctity, had difficulty living up to his example.<sup class="ref">[33]</sup> Nonetheless, devotion to the royal saint was strong, particularly among members of the royal house. Such patrons as Louis's daughter, Blanche; his wife, Marguerite; his grandson, Philip IV; Jeanne de Navarre; and Jeanne d'Evreux commissioned portraits of Saint Louis and cycles of his life in panel paintings, frescoes, stained glass, and manuscripts.<sup class="ref">[34]</sup> These cycles celebrated Louis IX's sanctity and the special status of the Capetians who were related to the saint.</p><p class="normal">Saint Louis played an important role in polemical discussion from the moment Philip of Valois succeeded the last direct Capetian. Philip viewed himself as the head of the Capetian house and often used references to Saint Louis, particularly during the first troubled years of his reign, to add the prestige of his royal ancestor to his own acts.<sup class="ref">[35]</sup> He ordered coinage early in his reign "of the weight and law of Saint Louis" and refrained from doctoring its composition until 1337 because of the value of its symbolic connection.<sup class="ref">[36]</sup> Between 1329 and 1331 a series of documents issued by Philip's chancery adopted the form employed by the Capetians, opening with an invocation and closing with the royal monogram and signatures of court officials. Cazelles notes that this literary form was abandoned as soon as Edward III confirmed the legitimacy of the Valois succession by acknowledging in 1331 that his homage of 1328 to the French should have been liege.<sup class="ref">[37]</sup></p><p class="normal">While Edward continued to claim the throne of France, however, he celebrated his own descent from Saint Louis. In the 1340 letter posted in northern French churches, he stressed that he did not want to infringe on the rights of the French people, but rather he wanted to return France to the "good laws and customs which existed in the time of our ancestor [and] progenitor Saint Louis, king of France."<sup class="ref">[38]</sup> He also emphasized the need for peace in Christian countries so that a crusade could be mounted to free the Holy Land.<sup class="ref">[39]</sup> The notion of a unified crusade of the Western nations was a recurring theme that became intertwined toward the end of the Hundred Years' War with prophecies of the last world emperor.<sup class="ref">[40]</sup> When Edward's letter was written and John's book painted, however, the references to a crusade probably related more closely to claims of direct descent from Saint Louis, the last crusading king of France, rather than to claims to world empire. They refer as well to the legitimate French king's status as "most Christian king."</p><p class="normal">The crusading reference in Edward's letter was probably a jibe at Philip and John.

The first two illustrate Louis's first crusade: one represents the dastardly behavior of the infidels (Fig. 41, assault on a castle by the Tartars); the second represents the response of the Christians (Fig. 42, the pope sends Bishop Odo to Paris; nobles listen to Bishop Odo</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">65</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00041.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 42<br /> Pope sends Bishop Odo to Paris; Nobles take the cross. <i> Grandes Chroniques de<br /> France</i> . British Library, Royal 16 G VI, fol. 403. By permission of the British Library.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">66</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00042.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 43<br /> Louis receives a letter about the Holy Land.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British Library,<br /> Royal 16 G VI, fol. 426v.<br /> By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00043.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 44<br /> Attack of the Tartars in the Holy Land. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British Library, Royal 16 G<br /> VI, fol. 427. By permission of the British Library.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">67</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">and take the cross). In the third subdivision in Louis's life a pair of miniatures explains why the French became involved in Louis's second crusade, in which he died. They illustrate the arrival of a letter from the pope and then represent its contents describing attacks by the infidels (Fig. 43, Charles of Anjou in council receives a letter from the pope; Fig. 44, attack of the Tartars in the Holy Land).</p><p class="normal">Aside from miniatures whose subjects can be classed as administrative (receptions of envoys and meetings with various heads of state; fols. 403v, 405, 406, 407, 407v, 408v), all other pictures of Louis's crusades bring out two themes: his victories in the Holy Land and his sanctity. Miniatures of Louis's triumphs in his first crusade show the battle and capture of Damietta (409v, 410v), but his religious devotion attracts more emphasis in such scenes as the pilgrimage to Nazareth (fol. 415v) or the burial of the dead after the massacre at Sidon (fol. 416v). The miniatures illustrating Louis's second crusade celebrate his sainthood more emphatically. Louis is nimbed throughout this final sequence of 10 pictures, which culminates with his instructions to his son (fol. 443v) and his death (Fig. 45).</p><p class="normal">In keeping with French policy of the 1330s and 1340s, this emphasis on Louis IX's life is less a call to a crusade than a celebration of the saintly king from whom John was descended and of the holy kingship to which John was</p><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00044.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 45<br /> Death of Saint Louis. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British Library, Royal 16 G VI, fol. 444v.<br /> By permission of the British Library.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">68</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">heir. The possibility that this celebration of descent from Louis IX may have had an anti-English component is strengthened by John's choice in 1350 to be crowned with the "crown of Saint Louis" rather than that of Charlemagne. This act was simultaneously a sign of his devotion to the saint and an affirmation of his legitimacy as successor to Saint Louis and to Philip of Valois.<sup class="ref">[44]</sup></p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">The Prerogatives of Holy Kingship</h3><p class="noindent">Two sets of images in John the Good's copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> introduce themes that were to become particularly important in the reigns of John and later Valois kings. Images in the life of Clovis refer to the <i>sacre</i> by the holy oil sent from God, and a rare picture in the life of Saint Louis refers to the king's role in the cure for scrofula. Both represent privileges that the French king claimed as the <i>roi très crétien</i> .</p><p class="normal">The right to be anointed with special oil sent from heaven distinguished the French ruler from all other rulers in Christendom and made him the equal, if not the superior, of the Holy Roman Emperor.<sup class="ref">[45]</sup> This right, which originated in the reign of Clovis, the first Christian king of France, is the subject of two large miniatures in John's chronicle. In the first (Fig. 46) Clovis routs the Germans under the protection of Christ, who gazes down at the battle.<sup class="ref">[46]</sup> The text explains that Clovis won this battle because he vowed to convert if given a victory. In the second large miniature (Fig. 47) Clovis is baptized by the holy oil brought by a dove. The only other large illustration (Fig. 48) in Clovis's life involves another miraculous sign from God. In it, messengers sent to the church of Saint Martin at Tours to ask for a sign of victory were greeted as they entered by the psalm, "Sire thou did gird me with strength for the battle. . . . Thou did make my assailants sink under me."<sup class="ref">[47]</sup> All three of these distinctive pictures celebrate the French kings' close relationship to God.</p><p class="normal">The holiness of Saint Louis's kingship is emphasized by the use of halos that focus particular attention on two sequences from the cycle of 60 pictures illustrating his life. This practice seems deliberate, since the halos have no discernible structural or textual function in these portions of the manuscript. It does not seem to be an artistic trait, since the two artists who painted these sequences did not use halos in other portions of Louis's life that they painted. Neither is it a case of mixing models from varied sources, since the scenes in which Louis wears a halo do not break down into iconographical units whose models could be isolated.</p><p class="normal">The most densely illustrated sequence begins when Louis takes the cross to go on his second crusade (fol. 436v); it continues through the series of 10 pictures that show the events that led to Louis's death in Tunis. In this sequence halos draw attention to a crusading subcycle that culminates in Louis's saintly death (Fig. 45).</p><p class="normal">The use of halos elsewhere in Louis's life is more puzzling. Only two from a series of scenes dedicated to his saintly behavior represent Saint Louis wearing a halo: Louis attending confession and being scourged by his confessor (Fig. 49), and Louis feeding the poor (fol. 423v). Ordinarily the authority of the pictorial model or peculiarities of the artist explain such intrusions, but such is not the case here.

The two pictures precede a miniature (Fig. 50) that occurs in no other copy of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> and, to my knowledge, in no manuscript predating the reign of Charles VII.<sup class="ref">[48]</sup> It represents a special prerogative given the French kings after their unction with the holy oil: the ability to cure scrofula, the disease known as "the king's evil." The picture shows Louis IX speaking as he touches the neck of a man who kneels before him; the text emphasizes Louis's devotion by describing how he introduced the sign of the cross into the ritual in order to minimize his own agency in the cure: "King Louis had the custom that while saying the words [of the ritual] he always made the sign of the cross which by the virtue of Our Lord cures the sick more than the royal dignity."<sup class="ref">[49]</sup> It is therefore likely that Louis was given a halo in the two previous scenes to reinforce God's role rather than his own in the third scene. A reader turning the pages in sequence would be struck by the lack of a halo in the picture of the cure for scrofula. The image would reinforce the textual reference to the role of Christ, rather than the king, in effecting the cure. One of the marginal glosses attests to the continued importance of this point at the time that John's manuscript was annotated: "Why</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">71</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00048.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 49<br /> Louis IX at confession; Louis disciplined by his confessor.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British Library, Royal 16 G<br /> VI, fol. 423. By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal">he [Saint Louis] attributes this virtue to the sign of the cross and not to the royal dignity."<sup class="ref">[50]</sup></p><p class="normal">This celebration of Louis's miraculous powers as king emphasizes his devotion and humility, but it also has political significance, for the ability of the French kings to cure the "king's evil" was being challenged for the first time. Throughout most of the fourteenth century, the ability of the French and English kings to perform miraculous healing had been accepted as fact and as a gift shared equally by both monarchies.<sup class="ref">[51]</sup> During the Hundred Years' War, however, the ability to cure may have become a sign of legitimacy. In the late 1340s a Frenchman was imprisoned for six years because he asserted that the king of England should be king of France because he cured scrofula better.<sup class="ref">[52]</sup></p><p class="normal">Perhaps because of the shaky political situation that existed in France, John the Good's <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> differs markedly from the book in the royal library that should logically have been its model: Philip III's <i>Grandes</i></p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">72</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00049.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 50<br /> Cure of scrofula. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British<br /> Library, Royal 16 G VI, fol. 424v.<br /> By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal"><i>Chroniques</i> (Ste.-Gen. 782). Philip III's manuscript was commissioned for him by the monks of Saint-Denis during a time of peaceful succession to the throne. Its text celebrates the royal line descended from Troy and the role of the abbey of Saint-Denis in French history. The pictures reinforce these themes in a program of just 36 images that illustrate their own texts carefully, but also establish visual cross-references intended to provide specific models of government for Philip.</p><p class="normal">The circumstances under which John's book was produced affected its content and appearance. Elements of its text and pictorial cycle suggest that it originated in the Parisian court rather than the Dionysian abbey. Its pictures support this interpretation, for their density is analogous to other commissions of John the Good and their form reflects contemporary styles in romances and saints' lives. These pictures function differently from those in Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Although the 600 scenes relate to their texts as closely as the pictures in the earlier chronicle, the density of the cycle in John's manuscript, which illustrates almost</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">73</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">every chapter of the text, made it impossible to implement the kind of cross-referencing that structures Philip III's book. Instead, the book's designer sought to break up the sequence of pictures by employing variations in scale and by playing on the presence or absence of such iconographic details as halos. Several images featured in this way focus the reader's attention on themes of Christian kingship, particularly on those that would bolster John's shaky position within the new Valois line <i> vis-à-vis</i> his English competitor.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">74</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter Four—<br /> The Courtly Response in Manuscripts by the Master of the <i>Roman de Fauvel</i></h2><p class="noindent">Most manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> that survive from the mid-fourteenth century were nonroyal copies made by Parisian booksellers for a courtly audience. The owners of these books, unlike the owners of the sophisticated, self-conscious royal manuscripts, did not belong to the long line of kings descended from Troy. Their ancestors had participated in battles, advised kings, or taken part in ceremonies described in the pages of the chronicle, yet rarely had they been protagonists. These courtly patrons therefore commissioned books that reflected their own roles in history by celebrating <i>les français</i> as well as <i> le roy</i> .<sup class="ref">[1]</sup></p><p class="normal">The earliest owners of these nonroyal books are unknown. It is therefore hard to determine whether a given program of illustration was selected because of its importance to a specific patron. It has been established, however, that many of these manuscripts were painted by the same artists.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup> A careful comparison of their cycles of illustration with those of royal commissions like John the Good's can therefore provide a clear picture of the different perceptions of history—particularly dynastic history like that of the <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> —among contemporary audiences.</p><p class="normal">The distinctive perspective of the courtly audience during the reigns of the early Valois kings can be seen in three copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Switzerland, private collection; B.R. 5; and Castres, B.M.) dating from the 1330s. They were illustrated by an artist who belonged to a group of miniaturists known collectively as the Master of the <i>Roman de Fauvel</i> .<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> Working for members of the nobility, this group of artists decorated a wide variety of texts: ancient and French history, romances, moralized Bibles, and saints' lives.</p><p class="normal">Little is known about the earliest provenance of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> manuscripts illustrated by the Master of the <i> Roman de Fauvel</i> , although all seem to have been courtly. By the 1340s the manuscript in Castres belonged to the wife of the French chancellor, and in the fifteenth century the chronicles now in Brussels and Switzerland were in the collection of the duke of Burgundy.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> The <i>libraires</i> who produced them could have had little access to royal models; their lives of Saint Louis, Philip III, and Philip IV are similar to one another but different from those of contemporary royal manuscripts. For example, in all the books from this group the life of Saint Louis incorporates the French translation of the continuation of Guillaume de Nangis used by Thomas of Maubeuge in his manuscript from the 1320s.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">75</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">Like Thomas of Maubeuge, the designers of these books apparently took the taste of their patrons into account by personalizing both text and pictures. Thus an unedited text describing John of Jerusalem's trip to Rome to ask for papal assistance for the Holy Land was apparently included in the Brussels chronicle to satisfy the requirements of a patron with a particular interest in this incident. Because the pictorial cycles in these manuscripts are as varied as their texts, a comparison of texts and images should cast light on the perceptions of French history by noble audiences in the mid-fourteenth century.</p><p class="normal">In analyzing the nobility's use of history, it is important to take into account the stock illustrations often used in decorating medieval books. For instance, an illustration of the baptism of Clovis, the first Christian king of France, in the manuscript in Brussels (Fig. 51) is quite closely related to a similar illustration in the Castres manuscript (Fig. 52). Although certain figures change—a queen in the Brussels version becomes a monk in the Castres version, a monk in the Brussels illustration becomes a bishop in the Castres miniature—the basic configuration is identical; it is simply expanded from its miniature format in the Castres manuscript to fill an oblong space in the book in Brussels. The similarity between battle scenes painted in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> overseen by Thomas of Maubeuge (B.N. fr. 10132) in the 1320s and those in the gathering of the Castres chronicle on which the same artist collaborated demonstrates the continuity of such models.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup></p><p class="normal">Because so many images in the Master of the <i>Roman de Fauvel's Grandes Chroniques</i> are stock scenes, it may be rash to suggest that their iconography expresses any individual owner's concerns.

Between the end of the life of Philip Augustus and the beginning of that of Louis VIII is a chapter (fol. 308) illustrated by the arrival of King John of Jerusalem at Rome (Fig. 60), describing how King John came to Rome to seek help and was supported by both the pope and Frederick, the Holy Roman Emperor, whose daughter John married. The following text establishes that John was effectively the last Christian King of the Holy Land. A royal manuscript might suggest that the French king should be the successor to John or, at the very least, might call for a crusade, but the Brussels text does neither. Instead, it changes the subject and describes once again the death and burial of Philip Augustus, perhaps to provide a transition to the life of Philip's son, Louis VIII, which follows the description of Philip Augustus's death.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup></p><p class="normal">The third manuscript, located in Castres, uses exceptional images to personalize and universalize the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .

Unlike the other two, this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was frequently updated, taking its present shape in a series of four or five campaigns over a period of 20 to 25 years. As originally planned, the book was the work of two scribes who wrote the history of France through the death of Philip Augustus, a frequent terminus for the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> and the endpoint for the manuscript in the Swiss private collection.

Spaces for illuminations were left in this section but were never filled.</p><p class="normal">This frequent updating suggests that the manuscript in Castres was as vital to its owners as royal copies of the chronicle had been to Philip III and John the Good. Thus, even if we cannot be completely sure of the identity of the original patron of this <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> , we may gain our clearest insights by examining how this highly valued manuscript reflects the historical perspective of its nonroyal audience.</p><p class="normal">The provenance of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in Castres suggests that the earliest owner was a figure at court. An inscription added above the chapter describing the Battle of Courtrai (Plate 3) in the first continuation is the earliest indication of ownership. Written in a different hand from that of the text, the inscription states, "These chronicles belong to Madame Jeanne d'Amboise, lady of Revel and of Tisauges,"<sup class="ref">[14]</sup> thus providing a precise date for the inscription. After the death of her second husband, the Seigneur de Tisauges, Jeanne married Guillaume Flote, Seigneur de Revel and chancellor of France from 1338 to 1348, whose first wife died in 1339.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup> The first owner of the book was probably Jeanne, a member of her family, or her husband. Guillaume Flote may have been the owner, since he commissioned other works decorated by this artist.<sup class="ref">[16]</sup></p><p class="normal">The placement of Jeanne's <i>ex-libris</i> strengthens the hypothesis that the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was given to Jeanne after her marriage. It appears above a miniature that represents one in a series of battles that Philip IV waged against rebellious Flemish forces between 1297 and 1304, when Jeanne was young. These battles were important for her family's history because her grandfather, Anseau de Chevreuse, the bearer of the <i> oriflamme</i> of France, the royal flag associated with Charlemagne, was killed during the campaign.<sup class="ref">[17]</sup> Had this been Jeanne's personal copy of the text, the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle, where her grandfather was killed, would probably have been illustrated. Since the Battle of Courtrai was the only image in the book to commemorate the Flemish campaign, however, it received her <i> ex-libris</i> .</p><p class="normal">The Battle of Courtrai had special significance for Jeanne's husband. Guillaume Flote's father, Pierre, was one of the few loyal French who remained with Robert of Artois and died at Courtrai after the rest of the French forces fled the field. In a rare illustration to this chapter the miniature below Jeanne's signature glorifies the bravery of men like Robert of Artois and Pierre Flote. It shows the turning point in the battle, when Robert of Artois, resplendent in his arms, rode directly at the Flemish who attacked as most of the French fled.<sup class="ref">[18]</sup> In the miniature a few soldiers visible beyond Robert fight with him. It is clear that Robert and this noble minority are doomed; they will take their places with the dead soldiers who litter the ground.</p><p class="normal">The illustration to the Battle of Courtrai is thus one of those rare instances when the royal history recorded in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> merges with the history of the nobility.

Of 65 miniatures, 13 are unique among those illustrating the Master of the <i>Roman de Fauvel's</i> manuscripts. These treat three broad themes: the first reveals the extent to which Dionysian legends fascinated a broad audience, the second examines the universal moral applications of French history, and the third concerns the relationship between the king and his vassals.

The text makes clear that this illustrates the founding of the abbey. A second image represents a later benefice allegedly given to the abbey by Charles the Bald (Fig. 62)—the Fair of Lendit. This picture, representing a shoe merchant, goldsmith, and clothes salesman at the fair, cuts its chapter in two in order to appear directly above the text explaining that Charles the Bald moved the fair from Aix-la-Chapelle to Saint-Denis at the same time that he presented a collection of relics of Christ's passion to the abbey.<sup class="ref">[19]</sup> Those who came to the fair and adored the relics were given a special indulgence. In Jeanne d'Amboise's book the merchants—part of the concrete reality that any visitor to the fair would see—are represented in the miniature rather than the legendary events or the ostentation of the relics that decorated John the Good's book (Fig. 63). Thus the emphasis would seem to be on economic reality rather than devotion to an illustrious ancestor (as in the contemporary royal manuscript). The final Dionysian picture expands the traditional representation of Charles the Bald's vision of hell (Fig. 64), which chastised him</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">86</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00062.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 63<br /> Ostentation of the relics. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British Library, Royal 16 G VI, fol. 163.<br /> By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal">into leading a good life. A second vision (Fig. 65), in which Charles the Bald appears to a monk of Saint-Denis seven years after his death, is represented less frequently. At this appearance Charles urged the monk to persuade the king of France and the abbot of Saint-Denis to move his body to the abbey.</p><p class="normal">These Dionysian images, very different in tone from those included in royal manuscripts, may reflect a popular perception of French history. The Fair of Lendit was an event experienced by many in Paris. Jongleurs sang <i>chansons de geste</i> , which, like the sermons given by the monks at the fair, explained how the relics came to the abbey. Moreover, the kings featured in the Dionysian pictures of Jeanne's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> —Dagobert and Charles the Bald—were the most visible of Merovingian and Carolingian rulers buried at Saint-Denis. Anyone touring the array of royal tombs in the abbey church would be struck by Dagobert's elaborate stone tomb near the altar and Charles the Bald's golden tomb in the place of honor in the choir.</p><p class="normal">The universal moral message of French history is the theme of one of the most interesting of the unique miniatures in this manuscript—a moral exemplum drawn from the life of Charlemagne. This picture (Fig. 66) illustrates the confrontation between Charlemagne and Agolant, a Moslem leader, during Charlemagne's crusade to rid Spain of pagans. One of only two <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> to illustrate this theme, Jeanne's book is the only one in which the picture is carefully placed to subdivide the chapter so that it is near the text that draws a broad Christian moral.<sup class="ref">[20]</sup> The chapter recounts how Agolant decided that it</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">87</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00063.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 64<br /> Charles the Bald's vision of hell. <i> Grandes Chroniques<br /> de France</i> . Castres, Bibliothèque Municipale, fol. 177.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Municipale, Castres.</p><p class="normal">was expedient to convert to Christianity after a series of defeats at the hands of Charlemagne's armies.

When asked the identity of 12 scruffily dressed men crouching on the dirt far from him, Charlemagne responded that they were poor men, "messengers of Christ," who were fed every day in memory of the apostles. Agolant was unimpressed by Charlemagne's treatment of Christ's messengers. He refused baptism, withdrew his troops, and recommenced battle. The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> draws the broad and obvious moral: "If Charlemagne lost King Agolant and his men, who would not be baptized because he saw the poor treated so villainously, what will happen on the day of judgment to those who in this mortal life despised the poor and treated them villainously? . . .

The first image (Fig. 67) represents Philip Augustus speaking to councillors and establishing the testament that he made when he left for the Crusades with Richard the Lionheart. Philip's testament designated those who should rule during his absence and made provisions for a regency if he were to die in the Holy Land. The rubric accompanying this picture emphasizes not Philip's wisdom as ruler, but the effect of his action on those left behind. This scene receives a different emphasis in John the Good's book, the only other to illustrate it.

The clearest illustration of this theme is an event in the story of the Battle of Bouvines, which pitted the French forces against those of the English king and the Holy Roman Emperor. One of the knights who made the battle possible was Ferrand, count of Hainaut and brother-in-law of the French king, who allowed the English and German forces to assemble at his chateau and allied himself with them against Philip Augustus, his liege lord. Two scenes represent Ferrand's punishment. First a standard workshop scene (Fig. 27) represents the French victory at Bouvines at which he was captured; then an exceptional image (Fig. 68) shows Ferrand being paraded in Philip's triumphal entry into Paris.

They did not provide a model of living history to their owners, but rather testified to popular reactions to the French past. For the patron of the book now in Switzerland (private collection), possession of the royal text was most important; illustration did little to shape a personal reading of the chronicle. In the chronicle now in Brussels (B.R. 5) pictures reveal an awareness of the importance of succession and the role of such models of kingship as Charlemagne in guaranteeing it.

The readers of Jeanne's chronicle knew that they would probably never have a place in its pages, and perhaps as a result even the exceptional pictures in this book reinforce generalized readings of the text.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">93</span> ―</div><h1 class="Heading-Heading2">PART III—<br /> THE <i>GRANDES CHRONIQUES</i> OF KING CHARLES V</h1><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">95</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter Five—<br /> The First Stage of Execution (before 1375)</h2><p class="noindent">During the reigns of the first Valois kings, manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> continued to offer different visual solutions to the problem of illustrating the chronicle. This situation changed when Charles V became king in 1364. Charles commissioned a continuation of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> that added accounts written at court about his father's and his own reign to the traditional history written by the monks at Saint-Denis about the Merovingians, Carolingians, and Capetians.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> The copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (B.N. fr. 2813) that this continuation expanded became an authoritative manuscript influencing a generation of royal and courtly books.</p><p class="normal">Charles V's manuscript incorporated the history of a new branch of the Capetians—the Valois—into the official history of the French kings at a time when the English crown was challenging the legitimacy of the Valois rulers. The addition of this new illustrated text to the king's copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was a timely reaction to contemporary politics and a typical one for this bibliophile king.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup></p><p class="normal">This version of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> took its present form in a series of four distinct campaigns of systematic modification and amendment<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> that enable us to trace the evolution of the complex interplay of words and images that characterizes Charles V's book. During the first stage of execution Henri de Trévou, the first scribe, wrote a two-volume chronicle that ended with the life of Philip of Valois. In the second stage of work Raoulet d'Orléans, the second scribe, introduced running titles, changed the last folios of the life of Philip of Valois, and added the narrative of the lives of John the Good and Charles V up to the events of 1375. During the third stage of production Raoulet d'Orléans recorded events from fall 1375 to spring 1379 and inserted five sets of text and miniatures into the first portion of the manuscript.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> The fourth and final stage occurred in the fifteenth century when the manuscript was rebound into one volume.</p><p class="normal">Because it dates from three distinct moments in Charles V's reign (before 1375, before 1377, and after 1378), this manuscript offers a rare opportunity to reconstruct the genesis and expansion of a political program. During the second and third stages of production the editors of the manuscript altered the focus of the original decorative program to reflect current political concerns by adding new text and miniatures and, on rare occasions, by substituting new text and illustrations for those in the first section of the manuscript. Pictures added in these stages refer</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">96</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">to miniatures in earlier segments of text, either by adopting parallel formats or by using similar iconographical detail. These references provide secondary levels of interpretation to the text that become comprehensible when we analyze the three different versions of the manuscript as separate entities.</p><p class="normal">Miniatures decorating the first portion of Charles V's book are the least complicated in placement, format, and content. Usually positioned at the head of major divisions in the text, these images are, with few exceptions, one column wide. They depict coronations, battles, or court scenes in a generalized fashion. Perhaps because of their straightforward portrayal of events, these pictures have not been a subject of study.</p><p class="normal">Nevertheless, certain texts and illustrations in the first part of the manuscript are especially noteworthy. The hierarchy of decoration within the pictorial cycle; the relationship of Charles V's manuscript to its textual model, which also doubled as a <i> maquette</i> or dummy for the disposition of miniatures; and the divergences in the program of Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> from that of a small group of manuscripts that closely copy it suggest that certain illustrated segments of the text were particularly important to the king. The lives of Charlemagne, Louis the Pious, Philip Augustus, and Saint Louis clearly have special significance, and the history of the early Norman dukes is detailed with a precision found in no other version of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .</p><p class="normal">The format of certain miniatures presented as large double or four-part pictures distinguishes them as more important than other illuminations in the book. For example, the frontispiece to the manuscript (fol. 4) is a large image encompassing four scenes. The first pictures for the lives of Charlemagne (fol. 85v), Louis the Pious (fol. 128), Philip Augustus (fol. 223), and Saint Louis (fol. 266v) are all double miniatures. Double miniatures also illustrate two scenes from the story of Roland (fols. 124, 128).</p><p class="normal">Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Ste.-Gen. 782), the model for a large portion of the text, provides further evidence for the significance of text, miniatures, and subcycles dealing with the dukes of Normandy, Charlemagne, and the concept of legitimacy. Kept in the royal library, this manuscript contains fourteenth-century marginal annotations addressed to Henri de Trévou, the scribe of Charles V's manuscript.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup> These dictate the placement or, in one case, the suppression of miniatures in Charles's chronicle and advocate the rearrangement of certain texts. Almost all these dictates were acted upon.</p><p class="normal">Two differences between Philip's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> and Charles V's are unheralded by the marginal notes directed to Henri. These address the problem of legitimacy; they include the suppression of the chapter on Hugh Capet, the first of the Capetian line, and the introduction from another source of the life of Louis VIII, which had not yet been written when Primat completed his translation.</p><p class="normal">Four later books modeled on Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> stress many of the same texts and include miniatures of the same subjects. Yet a comparison of these manuscripts suggests that certain innovations in the program of Charles V's book appealed to a narrow audience. For example, a manuscript of unknown provenance (Lyon, B.M. 880); two texts owned by Charles V's son, Charles VI (B.N. fr. 10135 and fr. 2608); and one owned by Charles VI's chamberlain, John of Montaigu, (Vienna, ÖNB 2564) neither omit Hugh Capet's life nor place great emphasis on the history of the Norman dukes. These features are unique to Charles</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">97</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">V's manuscript.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> A comparison of these manuscripts also suggests that the dense cycle illustrating the life of Saint Louis may have had a special significance for certain kings of France since it appears only in Charles V's and Charles VI's copies.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">Politics in the Duchy of Normandy</h3><p class="noindent">Charles V's interest in the history of the Norman dukes is not surprising in light of contemporary events. In the mid-1350s John the Good made Charles duke of Normandy.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup> In this capacity he had to contend with the attempts of his cousin, Charles of Navarre, to foment rebellion from his base in Evreux as part of an attempt to win the French throne. The situation was complicated by the activities of the English king, Edward III, a second claimant to the throne who periodically invaded Normandy. Charles V's attempts to gain control of Normandy were successful. With the Treaty of Brétigny in 1360 and Charles of Navarre's homage at Vernon in 1371, Charles V made tentative peace with his rivals. Nevertheless, as the French land closest to England, the duchy of Normandy remained a point of contention throughout Charles V's reign.</p><p class="normal">Charles's role as duke of Normandy may explain the pictorial emphasis on the lives of Norman dukes in his chronicle. By emphasizing a number of events in the history of the early dukes, rubrics and illustrations introduced into the book establish parallels between Charles's ducal predecessors and his royal ancestors. Some of the textual changes specified in the margins of Philip III's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> highlight the activity of the early Norman rulers. First, they suggest the inclusion of new rubrics that increase the prominence of Dukes Rollo (Robert I) and Raoul of Normandy and Kings Louis, Lothar, Robert II, and Henry of France. In addition, they advocate the subdivision of certain chapters to stress divine intervention in the conquest of Normandy (the appearance of Saint Benedict to Count Sigillophes), emphasize the Christianity of the early dukes (the baptism of Rollo at which he took the name Robert), and discuss treachery against the Normans (the treason of the count of Flanders). They also note the Normans' ability to seek peace (alliance with King Lothar of France) and praise their repulsion of an English invasion (by Ethelred II) and their willingness to go on crusade. The only chapter formed by subdivision that deals with a French king discusses Robert II's generosity to the abbey of Saint-Denis just before his death.</p><p class="normal">The placement of miniatures, also noted in the margins of Philip's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , places equal emphasis on the importance of the Norman subcycle. For instance, the only annotation recommending suppression of an image occurs on folio 209 (Figs. 12 and 69), where a note to Henri suggests that he skip a miniature depicting Richard of Burgundy chasing the Normans out of his realm in order to insert a picture of the Normans landing in Neustria, two paragraphs later, at the commencement of the description of Rollo's activities. Three other miniatures illustrate chapters created by the subdivision of this portion of Primat's text.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup></p><p class="normal">These newly subdivided chapters describe traits in the Norman predecessors of Charles V that were normally attributed to French kings.

Charlemagne's importance for French kingship and his special significance to Charles V must have been a factor in the elaboration of this sequence of illustrations.<sup class="ref">[10]</sup> Charles had a <i>chambre de Charlemagne</i> in his Hôtel Saint-Pol and was often compared to Charlemagne in the prefaces of works that he commissioned, such as Raoul de Praelles's translation of the <i> City of God</i> in 1375.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup> Charles V was the first French king actively to promote the cult of Charlemagne. In a speech delivered in 1378 Charles even referred to "saint charlemaine," a status that Charlemagne was not usually accorded.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup></p><p class="normal">As Charles V's only canonized ancestor, Saint Louis also earned a special place in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Devotion to Louis was widespread, particularly among his Capetian descendants, who commissioned numerous cycles of his life.

The four-part miniature (Fig. 71) preceding Book I illustrates the Greeks landing in Troy, their assault on the city, Francion founding Sicambria, and the defeat of the armies of Emperor Theodosius by Trojan descendants. The emperor's defeat is strongly emphasized. As the imperial army flees the Trojan onslaught, the emperor tumbles from his horse to land prominently in the foreground. The miniature clearly celebrates the Trojan ancestry of French kings: in the final, triumphal scene, for example, the Trojan king wears a tunic strewn with fleurs-de-lis, and his horse is richly draped in material of the same pattern. The triumph of the Trojans over the Roman emperor is therefore emblematic of the independence of France from the empire, as stressed in contemporary political theory.</p><p class="normal">Such comparisons of royal and imperial status are restricted to royal manuscripts.

It includes the image of the fallen emperor and signals the French presence by fleur-de-lis finials atop the towers of Troy. A third frontispiece from a contemporary, nonroyal <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (B.N. fr. 17270, fol. 2v) also copies the four-part composition of Charles V's manuscript, but it suppresses the fleur-de-lis of France and the tumbling emperor. Although justified by the narrative, the careful equation of the Trojan and French kings and the inclusion of the fallen emperors in the two royal manuscripts elaborate upon their texts. The nonroyal manuscript omits any such elaboration, although the editor would have been familiar with the royal versions.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">Dynastic Legitimacy and the Reditus</h3><p class="noindent">Charles V's concerns with the legitimacy of dynastic succession probably caused the suppression of the chapter on Hugh Capet when Charles's book was copied from Primat's presentation copy. The first portion of the suppressed text advances the doctrine of the <i>reditus regni ad stirpem Karoli Magni</i> . This was desirable material but could easily be omitted because the interpolated life of Louis VIII reiterates and expands upon the <i>reditus</i> theme. The second portion of Hugh Capet's life may have been the section that led to the chapter's suppression. In describing Hugh's reign, it includes an episode in which Hugh unjustly imprisons Arnoul, the archbishop of Reims, because Arnoul, though a bastard, is descended more directly than Hugh from the line of Charlemagne. As a result of his abuse of kingship, Hugh Capet is excommunicated. Only when Arnoul is freed and restored to his post is the ban lifted. Hugh Capet's fear of an illegitimate descendant of Charlemagne and the implication that Hugh was not a legitimate ruler may have provided sufficient reason for suppressing the passage in Charles V's book; it was uncomfortably close to events surrounding the Valois succession to the Capetians, when English claimants believed that they were more closely related to Saint Louis than were the Valois kings of France.</p><p class="normal">Hugh's life could be skipped without disrupting narrative continuity, because the chapters that precede and follow it provide a smooth transition. Charles of Lorraine's life ends by noting that after Hugh Capet ensured the extinction of Charlemagne's line, he had himself crowned in the city of Reims, and the life of Hugh Capet's son Robert begins with the statement that after Hugh died, Robert became king. Revisions in the text of Charles's chronicle thus ensured that the Capetians succeeded the Carolingians with a minimum of controversy.</p><p class="normal">Notes to Henri de Trévou in Philip's book reinforce the idea that the textual editing deliberately minimized questions about Hugh's legitimacy as ruler. The note to Henri in the margin of Hugh Capet's life in Ste.-Gen. 782 is the only one to show equivocation on the part of the designer. It originally consisted of the word "hyst," meaning "miniature." But "hyst" is crossed out and replaced by the words "une vignette," meaning "historiated initial"—"une" placed to the right of "hyst" and "vignette" to the left, thus downgrading the illustration originally planned for the passage on Hugh Capet.<sup class="ref">[13]</sup> Ultimately the picture was downgraded even further when this note was erased (it is now visible only under ultraviolet light) and the life of Hugh Capet was omitted from Charles V's chronicle.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">103</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">In Charles's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> the illustration to the life of Louis VIII, the only other text to deal explicitly with the <i>reditus</i> and with dynastic change also minimizes the turbulence of the transition from Carolingian to Capetian government. Instead of featuring Louis's coronation or his actions in Aquitaine, as do virtually all earlier copies containing this text, this picture (Fig. 73) illustrates a prophecy that fixed a time for the <i>reditus</i> and provided a reason for the transition from Carolingian to Capetian government. According to this prophecy, Saint Valery rewarded Hugh the Great, the father of Hugh Capet, for translating his body and that of Saint Riquier. To thank Hugh the Great, Saint Valery appeared to him in a dream and revealed that Hugh's descendants would reign as kings of France for seven generations—precisely the amount of time between Hugh Capet and Philip Augustus, whose son Louis VIII fulfilled the <i> reditus</i> .<sup class="ref">[14]</sup></p><p class="normal">By illustrating the Valerian prophecy, the miniature beginning Louis VIII's life leads the reader to skip over the preliminary materials of the chapter, which describe Hugh Capet's usurpation and the <i>reditus</i> , and to dwell on the miraculous promise to Hugh Capet's father, here shown as a king.

This theme affected the rearrangement of chapters in the lives of the early dukes of Normandy, discussed earlier in this chapter. It also explains the inclusion of double miniatures in the story of Roland.</p><p class="normal">Two double miniatures from the life of Charlemagne represent a kingly prerogative: meting out justice in a just cause. Charlemagne's life was much more densely illuminated in Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> than in its textual model; a cycle of nineteen miniatures replaces the five decorating the earlier book. Of the miniatures in Charles's codex, two in particular were laid out with special care. Twice in Book V of the life of Charlemagne (the story of Roland) a notation dictated that space should be left for a double miniature, a form of decoration that occurs only four times in over 380 folios and that in every other case heads the first chapter of a king's life.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup> These pictures illustrate a crime and its punishment. A double miniature (Fig. 74) represents the gifts sent as a false sign of peace to Charlemagne by Marsile, the Saracen king, with the help of Ganelon, one of Charlemagne's trusted advisors, and the subsequent battle in which Ganelon's treacherous act results in the slaughter of Charlemagne's men. The second pair of miniatures (Fig. 75) shows the just punishment for Ganelon's treason against a king. In one image the outcome of single combat determines Ganelon's guilt; in the second picture Ganelon is quartered by two horsemen.</p><p class="padded">The part of Charles V's manuscript written by Henri de Trévou is illustrated by generalized images, but these pictures nonetheless express ideas that become increasingly important in the formation of the program of illustration in subsequent continuations of this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Through the rearrangement or suppression of texts and the importance accorded certain miniatures by their different formats, the first portion of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> focuses attention on Charles V's rights to Normandy, emphasizes the continuous descent of Capetian from Carolingian, and stresses the importance of saintly ancestors and just behavior. Finally, it highlights rulers of France who were also emperors and may assert the power of the French king <i>vis-à-vis</i> the emperor.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">106</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter Six—<br /> The Second Stage of Execution (c. 1375—77)</h2><p class="noindent">In contrast to the first stage of production of Charles V's <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> , which recorded French history from the fall of Troy to the death of Philip of Valois in 1350, the second portion describes only 25 years, from the accession of John the Good in 1350 to the ordinance of 1375, which established the age of majority for French kings at 14.</p><p class="normal">The quarter century recorded in this portion of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was a time of marked change in the political fortunes of France.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> Early in his reign John the Good, Charles V's father, was captured by the English at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. Charles then began a gradual consolidation of power, first as <i>lieutenant de roi</i> and regent during his father's captivity and finally as king after John's death in England in 1364. The text reports a string of successes for the French house: the negotiation of a tentative peace with England; the suppression of rebellions fueled by Charles V's relative, Charles of Navarre, in Paris and Normandy; the homage of Charles of Navarre before Charles V; and, most important, the birth of a royal heir to Charles V and Jeanne of Bourbon.</p><p class="padded">A cycle of 26 miniatures faithfully mirrors the events recorded in the text. Most of these miniatures depict Charles's struggle with Étienne Marcel, the provost of Paris, or with Charles of Navarre, a claimant to the French throne. A second, smaller group of miniatures celebrates positive events of the reign by depicting important ceremonies. The large scale of these ceremonial pictures and their attention to details of costume and armorial bearings establish their importance. Their images evoke two broad themes: the idea of French supremacy over the English through the glorification of ideals of kingly behavior exemplified by John the Good, and the continuity of the Valois line in Charles's heir, Charles VI. In both cases the miniatures combine with their texts to focus on the past and future of the Valois line.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">Kingship and Internal Politics</h3><p class="noindent">Textual changes in the first continuation of Charles V's <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> promote ideals of kingly behavior in the context of contemporary political rivalries, exaggerating English misconduct and minimizing French deficiencies. When Raoulet d'Orléans continued Henri de Trévou's text, he substituted four rewritten pages for the last few folios of the life of Philip of Valois and made editorial changes in the first part of the same gathering.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup> Almost all the leaves immediately preceding</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">107</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">the substitution are corrected more carefully than in the first portion of the book. In fact, three folios before the change of scribe, a sizable paragraph dealing with the abbey of Saint-Denis is crossed out emphatically and a red <i>vacat</i> (void) penned in its margins (fol. 383). This unflattering paragraph refers to Philip of Valois's request for the abbey's gold crucifix as a war subsidy despite a papal inscription on its base threatening excommunication of the person who dared remove it from the abbey.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> This account of kingly greed, like the account of Hugh Capet's jealousy in the first portion of the chronicle, was probably deemed unsuitable in a royal commission.</p><p class="normal">A few folios later, in the substituted text, an elaborate description of the siege of Calais reveals a more extensive example of pro-French editing. Later versions of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> contain the text that probably originally existed in Charles's manuscript. They simply state that Philip of Valois arrived too late to help the residents of Calais, who surrendered because they had nothing to eat.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> This book, however, stresses the "great care and diligence" with which Philip tried to help the city; the wickedness of the English king, who broke a treaty to continue the siege; and the suffering of the people of Calais, reduced to eating horses, cats, dogs, and rats, before their surrender.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup></p><p class="normal">Like these texts, prominent images also promote French superiority over the English. They laud the kingly behavior of John the Good and denigrate the English. For example, one of the most striking miniatures in this portion of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , a picture of the meeting and feast of the Order of the Star (Fig. 76), illustrates a chapter that describes the treachery of the English, who broke a treaty with the French to capture the city of Guines.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> This picture commands the reader's attention by its position and scale; it follows the text that it illustrates, and it is one of only three miniatures in the whole manuscript that fill three-quarters of a page each.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup></p><p class="normal">The rubric to this chapter suggests that the miniature of the Order of the Star is related to the text that precedes it. In Charles V's manuscript the traditional rubric for the third chapter of John the Good's life, "How the city and castle of Guines were captured by the English, the day that the king of France celebrated with the Order of the Star at Saint-Ouen," is expanded to include the phrase, "which feast is portrayed and illustrated below."<sup class="ref">[8]</sup></p><p class="normal">The picture illustrates a discussion between the king and several members of the order on the occasion of a feast. Regarding this episode, the text simply states that John the Good founded the order in October 1351 and that the members wore stars on their hoods or mantles. The picture, on the other hand, includes more specific details of costume: white tunics, red mantles, pearl-studded fillets that the participants tied around their foreheads, and complicated stars.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup></p><p class="normal">Because the order no longer existed in the 1370s, this image is an archaeological reconstruction. Both the royal accounts relating to the execution of elements of costume and John the Good's ordinance sent to a group of nobles and princes in 1351 to recruit members offer proof that the costumes included in the painting were authentic.<sup class="ref">[10]</sup> Thus, when this miniature was painted, more than 20 years after the event, the artist incorporated evidence derived either from an eyewitness account of the events or from court documents.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup></p><p class="normal">Why lavish so much attention on a miniature that not only departs from traditional placement and scale but also addresses a subject of apparently little</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">108</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00075.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 76<br /> Order of the Star. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Nationale,<br /> Ms. fr. 2813, fol. 394. Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">109</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00076.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 77<br /> John the Good enters London. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr.<br /> 2813, fol. 438. Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal">significance to the text? The answer lies in the motivation for the founding of the order and in the contemporary perception of its goals. The full title of the order, Company of Knights of Our Lady of the Noble House at Saint-Ouen, gives a clue to its purpose.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup> To create a tighter bond between John and members of the nobility, the order intertwined the cult of the Virgin with a series of regulations that restricted the conditions under which a member could do battle. Ties like the one created by this order became increasingly necessary for the French as loyalties shifted during the Hundred Years' War.</p><p class="normal">Even more important to an understanding of this picture, however, is the relationship between the Order of the Star and the English Order of the Garter, founded by Edward III.<sup class="ref">[13]</sup> The rules and goals of these orders changed in response to each monarch's need to ensure the loyalty of his troops and, more important, in response to developments on the other side of the channel. Thus the Order of the Star, founded approximately three years after its English counterpart, was a rallying point for French chivalry—a political statement expressing clear opposition to the English and perhaps responding to the Order of the Garter.</p><p class="normal">The relationship between this miniature and its text confirms the political interpretation of the Order of the Star in France. While the text focuses on the neglect of a treaty by the English and their use of treachery to capture a city, the miniature presents a picture of the victorious French king united with his loyal knights, who stand in opposition to those who threaten the realm. Thus French virtue is contrasted with English decadence.</p><p class="normal">The only other two-column miniature featuring John the Good offers a more specific glorification of kingly behavior.

Of the 175 pictures in this manuscript, it is one of only two derivative miniatures, a status that raises questions about its function in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Though derivative, it is not an exact copy of its model. Subtle changes in composition and heraldry, which alter the image to fit its new setting, can be explained by careful consideration of the specific context of Charles V's manuscript and the more generalized context of contemporary historical events.</p><p class="normal">The image was painted between 1375 and 1377 to decorate a continuation of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , written at court, that ends in a chapter covering two events of 1375: the publication in the Parlement of Paris of the ordinance regulating the majority of the French kings and the making of a treaty with the English at Bruges.<sup class="ref">[17]</sup> Apparently the chronicle was thought complete at this time and was probably bound. This continuation provides the specific context for the miniature.</p><p class="normal">In the detail employed the portrayal of the ceremony in this miniature differs from depictions in the manuscript of the commencement of other kings' reigns. Compare, for example, the details of the illustration of John the Good's coronation (Fig. 79), painted in the same campaign as the double scene of Charles V</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">112</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">and Jeanne of Bourbon. In this image the fleur-de-lis identifies the coronation as French, but it is impossible to identify the king. In the double miniature the king and queen hold recognizable objects: Charles grasps a scepter representing Charlemagne enthroned, which was made for him and is still preserved in the Louvre, and Jeanne of Bourbon holds in her right hand the scepter of Dagobert, known from eighteenth-century drawings by Montfaucon.<sup class="ref">[18]</sup></p><p class="normal">Scholars have explained the specificity of this picture by citing its models—images from Charles V's commemorative <i> Coronation Book</i> (Plates 5 and 6).<sup class="ref">[19]</sup> The <i>Coronation Book</i> , produced in 1365 under Charles V's direct supervision, was decorated by the same workshop that later painted the double picture in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Because it formed part of the royal library, the <i>Coronation Book</i> was an authoritative and convenient model for the images in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . This relationship provides a plausible explanation for the compositional similarity of the images, but it makes their other differences even more problematic.</p><p class="normal">One puzzling difference is the moment chosen to illustrate the beginning of Charles V's reign. Instead of the moment of coronation, the picture in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> represents a portion of the ceremony that occurred after the coronation proper—a symbolic expression of support for the new king and queen by the clerical and lay peers. The text of the chronicle does not mention this occurrence. It states that the king and queen were crowned and lists some of the nobles in attendance.<sup class="ref">[20]</sup> Strictly speaking, the miniatures of the coronations of Charles V and Jeanne of Bourbon from the <i>Coronation Book</i> would have been more appropriate models if the only goal of this picture were the commemoration of the event recounted in the text.<sup class="ref">[21]</sup></p><p class="normal">Another significant divergence from the <i>Coronation Book</i> is evident in the placement of the queen's picture next to the king's. As recorded in the <i>Coronation Book</i> , the ceremony of the queen's coronation was begun only after the king's was finished. The double miniature in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> thus juxtaposes two pictures that were separated by 11 folios and as many miniatures in the <i>Coronation Book</i> . This representation of parallel moments from the two ceremonies glosses over the temporal separation between them and, in the process, gives more prominence to the queen, presenting her on an almost equal footing with the king.</p><p class="normal">The heraldry of the double miniature in Charles V's chronicle is also subtly different from that of its models. In the <i>Coronation Book's</i> treatment of the king's coronation, one image (Plate 5) shows the king flanked by the count of Flanders, the duke of Bourbon, the count of Toulouse, the duke of Anjou, the archbishop of Reims, and the bishop of Beauvais. The corresponding miniature of the queen's coronation (Plate 6) shows the queen flanked by the count of Toulouse, the count of Étampes, the bishop of Beauvais, and the archbishop of Reims.<sup class="ref">[22]</sup></p><p class="normal">The positions of three people changed when these scenes were copied into the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Plate 4). In the scene showing the peers supporting the crown after the coronation of the queen, the duke of Burgundy replaced the count of Toulouse, and the duke of Bourbon replaced the count of Étampes.<sup class="ref">[23]</sup> In the scene with the king, the count of Étampes takes the position near the king that the duke of Bourbon held in the <i>Coronation Book</i> .</p><p class="normal">These careful heraldic changes do not increase the historical accuracy of the picture. Of the peers distinguished by heraldry in the miniatures, the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> only mentions the presence of the archbishop of Reims; the bishop</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">113</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">of Beauvais; Louis, duke of Anjou; and Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy at the ceremony.<sup class="ref">[24]</sup> Although not mentioned specifically in the text of the chronicle, the count of Étampes, the count of Flanders, and the duke of Bourbon were peers at the time of the coronation; they were listed as such in both Charles V's <i>Coronation Book</i> and the conflicting list of peers that appeared in the <i>Traité du sacre</i> , the commentary on the ceremony of coronation commissioned by Charles V from Jean Golein in 1374.<sup class="ref">[25]</sup></p><p class="normal">Whether the counts of Flanders and Toulouse were really present at the coronation is not germane to this discussion, since the counts appear in both the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> and the <i> Coronation Book</i> . More intriguing are the differences introduced in the <i>Grandes Chroniques:</i> the duke of Burgundy is brought into the scene of support for the queen, and the positions of the duke of Bourbon and the count of Étampes are changed to place the duke of Bourbon by the queen.</p><p class="normal">Because the dukes of Bourbon and Burgundy and the count of Étampes were present at the coronation, pictorial or written accounts of the ceremony cannot explain discrepancies between these pictures. In fact, the reason may have been Charles V's concerns for the education of his heir. Charles V's first child, who became Charles VI, was born in 1368 during the period between the execution of the <i>Coronation Book</i> and the <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . The birth of a son, which had been eagerly anticipated for 18 years, ensured the continuity of the Valois line. To safeguard this continuity in the event of his death, Charles V promulgated three ordinances in 1374.<sup class="ref">[26]</sup> One concerned the age of majority. Published in the Parlement of Paris in 1375, it was the subject of the last chapter of Charles V's life in this copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . It thus closed the reign that began with the scene of the peers' support. In many ways this ordinance marked a logical ending for this version of the chronicle, which was written and painted between 1375 and 1377, while Charles V was still king. Although it did not complete Charles V's life, it did provide a plan for a smooth transition to his son's government.</p><p class="normal">A second ordinance, which was not included in the chronicle, charged Jeanne of Bourbon with the education and upbringing of her children and provided her with two principal assistants: her brother-in-law, Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy; and her brother, Louis, duke of Bourbon. The association of Philip and Louis with the queen in this special charge must have been reason enough to include them with her in this picture and could help to explain why the queen's picture was placed next to the king's—to demonstrate the provisions for legitimate government.</p><p class="normal">The decision to depict a moment of support rather than the moment of coronation may also reflect Charles V's concern with providing a smooth transition to the government of his heir. A contemporary text, the <i>Traité du sacre</i> by Jean Golein, provides insights into the significance of this ceremony.<sup class="ref">[27]</sup> Completed in the same year as the ordinance on government and contemporary with the painting of the miniature in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , Golein's treatise glosses the events of the coronation with an explanation of their symbolic meaning. In his treatise Golein frequently stresses the peers' role in assisting in the just government of France as defenders of king and realm. According to Golein, "The peers surround the king to signify the forces who surround Solomon, all of them expert with the sword, skilled in battle, because if they [the peers] are not presently holding their swords, they are nearby to be taken when it is time to defend the king and realm."<sup class="ref">[28]</sup></p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">114</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">Perhaps dual images of baronial support were represented in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> to show that the peers were ready to defend their present king (Charles V) and to uphold the government of his descendants—a government in which the queen and the peers flanking her were supposed to play an important role.</p><p class="normal">On the most basic level, this picture is a special commemoration of Charles V's and Jeanne of Bourbon's coronations in 1364, deriving its iconography from the official commemorative manuscript of the coronation. However, this commemorative function may be less important than a second function: to introduce Charles V's reign while simultaneously alluding to its conclusion—to the provisions for government under the young dauphin and the peers' duty to protect and defend the realm and their king, no matter what his age.</p><p class="normal">Support for this interpretation is found in an analysis of a miniature representing the baptismal procession of the dauphin (Fig. 80), the only other large ceremonial picture from this version of Charles's life.<sup class="ref">[29]</sup> The theme of dynastic continuity to which the miniature of baronial support only alludes is amplified in the representation of the procession that took place in 1368 when Charles's firstborn son was christened. This illustration reflects its narrative, which describes the order of the large procession and lists the distinguished guests in attendance.<sup class="ref">[30]</sup> Of particular interest is the description of Queen Jeanne of Evreux, widow of Charles IV, carrying the dauphin between his two godfathers, Charles of Montmorency and Charles of Dammartin, in the procession to the church. To increase compositional clarity in the miniature, the queen is placed slightly behind the godfathers, in a position that further emphasizes her important role in the event.

Dating from the 1380s, the continuations of the <i>Chronique abrégée</i> include a description of the baptism identical to that of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> except that Jeanne of Evreux's part in the ceremony is suppressed, and Charles of Montmorency carries the infant, accompanied by Charles of Dammartin.<sup class="ref">[33]</sup> This deviation is notable in a text that copies Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> so carefully that it transcribes one of the marginal notes unique to this royal manuscript.<sup class="ref">[34]</sup> The exact significance of this break from the official account preserved in Charles's manuscript remains undetermined. It may be that Jeanne of Evreux's death in 1371, which ended her negotiations between the houses of France and Navarre, also lessened her utility as a symbol of Capetian support for the Valois line. A second possibility is that the compiler of the <i>Chronique abrégée</i> noted an inconsistency in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , which he rectified. The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> describes Jeanne of Evreux carrying the dauphin but also includes her among the distinguished guests following behind in the procession, "la royne Jeanne, la Duchesse d'Orliens sa fille."<sup class="ref">[35]</sup></p><p class="padded">The miniatures that punctuate Raoulet d'Orléans's first continuation of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> function differently from those in the earlier portion of the manuscript. Illustrations to the life of John the Good and the first part of the life of Charles V document Charles's gradual consolidation of power. At the same time, a small group of texts and images of ceremony that are unique to this manuscript addresses different issues. Their assertion of French supremacy through illustrations of John the Good's kingship and through the emphasis on the Valois succession in images of Charles VI manifests underlying political and dynastic themes that reach fuller expression in the third part of the manuscript.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">116</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter Seven—<br /> The Third Stage of Execution (after 1379)</h2><p class="noindent">The third stage of production of Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> —Raoulet d'Orléans's second continuation—spans the shortest period, beginning with events of fall 1375 and terminating in April 1379.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> Unlike the second portion of the chronicle, which documents Charles V's consolidation of power, this part describes a difficult time in France's history. With the exception of the state visit of the Holy Roman Emperor, the events of this era were bleak. After the death of the Black Prince in 1376 and Edward III in 1377, an infant, Richard II, assumed the English throne with a government dominated by his uncles. War with England resumed, the confessions of Jacques la Rue and Pierre le Tertre confirmed the long-suspected treachery of Charles of Navarre, and the Papal Schism began.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup></p><p class="padded">During this stage of production several changes were made to earlier portions of the manuscript, and new material was introduced. A new frontispiece was added to the first volume, and four sets of leaves were excised from the lives of Saint Louis and Philip of Valois, written in the chronicle's first stage, and replaced by illustrated texts addressing the question of Valois legitimacy and thus reinforcing many of the themes present in earlier portions of the book. The miniatures executed in Raoulet's second continuation further promote the theme of French kingship by defining the king's relation to the emperor, with particular emphasis on his primacy in France. Indeed, this is a central focus of this continuation: 17 miniatures portray events from the Holy Roman Emperor's visit to Paris in 1378.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">The Five Substitutions</h3><p class="noindent">The five substitutions of this continuation comprise two texts dealing with homage, illustrated with three miniatures; a third text describing events that surrounded Philip of Valois's succession to the throne of France, illustrated with one miniature; a fourth text, a short prefatory paragraph to the life of Saint Louis, with a full-page frontispiece and author's portrait; and a frontispiece for the whole manuscript. Each of the substituted folios contains textual or visual material unique to Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Seen together, they constitute a forceful reaffirmation of the legitimacy of the Valois line in response to English claims to the French throne, accomplished in part by the assertion of parallels between Saint Louis and his Valois descendants.</p><p class="normal">The type of homage owed to the French king by the English ruler for his duchies in France had long been an issue between France and England and was</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">117</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">of particular importance to the early Valois rulers.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> The dispute was rooted in the Treaty of Paris, concluded between Louis IX and Henry III in 1259, which called upon the French king to cede certain lands to the English king in return for his liege homage. Criticized for having alienated important lands in the treaty in exchange for mere homage, Louis retorted, as Joinville notes, "It seems to me that that which I give Henry III, I use well because he was not my vassal, and because of this event he enters into my homage."<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> The English kings grudgingly renewed their homage at each change of reign: Edward I paid homage to Philip IV of France in 1286, and Edward II paid homage to Philip IV (1308) and Philip V (1320). In none of these cases, however, did the king pay liege homage because he did not swear the oath of fidelity.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup></p><p class="normal">When Philip of Valois came to the throne in 1328 he, like his predecessors, summoned the English king to pay homage for his duchies in France.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> Edward III arrived at Amiens in 1329 but, like his father and grandfather, pledged a less-binding, conditional homage that omitted the oath of fidelity to the French ruler. Twice in 1330 Edward was summoned to appear in France in order to confirm that the homage of 1329 had been liege and to swear the oath of fidelity. In 1331 Edward sent a letter to Philip stating that he should have performed liege homage in 1329; however, he did not make the trip to France and, in fact, never performed liege homage in person.</p><p class="normal">The issue of liege homage is the focus of two of the four sets of substituted leaves in Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . As Paulin Paris and others have noted, these insertions expand short discussions of homage in the lives of Saint Louis (chapter 84) and Philip of Valois (chapter 6) with three miniatures and the texts of two documents from the <i>Trésor des chartes:</i> the Treaty of Paris and the letter Edward III sent Philip in 1331.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup></p><p class="normal">In the first miniature of homage (Fig. 81) Henry III kneels before Saint Louis and clasps his hands while witnesses peer from either side of the royal pair and from the lower margin of the page. Rather than occupying the traditional place at the head of the chapter, this miniature precedes the text of the Treaty of Paris, in which the English king first agreed to pay liege homage to the French king and his heirs for lands in France (Gascony, including Bordeaux and Bayonne, and the channel islands) and to renounce claims to lands held by the French in Normandy, Anjou, Touraine, Maine, and Poitou.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup></p><p class="normal">Two miniatures in the second insertion (Figs. 82 and 83) illustrate the letter sent to Philip of Valois in 1331, which not only confirmed that Edward should have performed liege homage in 1329, but also described the form that all future ceremonies of homage should adopt.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup></p><p class="normal">The illustrated texts interpolated into the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> at this stage of production blur distinctions between the homage that took place in 1329 and that which was described in 1331, distorting the actual ceremony of homage to bolster the French position and promote the legitimacy of the Valois line. Textual changes in the manuscript manipulate the description of the events of 1329 to imply that the English king unequivocally accepted the Valois succession immediately after Philip of Valois's accession in 1328, rather than three years later. In addition, the chapter describing the 1329 ceremony of homage incorporates the letter written in 1331, preceded by a paragraph stating that the plain homage paid in 1329 was just like the liege homage described in the letter.

The original rubric shows the English king as a less-than-willing participant: "How the king of England went to sea to go to the city of Amiens <i>where the above-mentioned king had</i> to pay homage to the king of France for the duchy of Aquitaine and for the county of Ponthieu as vassal of the king of France [my italics]."<sup class="ref">[11]</sup> Its corrected version, "How the king of England went to sea to go to the city of Amiens to pay homage to the king of France . . . ," suggests that the homage was freely offered.</p><p class="normal">The illustration that immediately follows this rubric freezes the English king's action as he prepares to kneel and extend his hands to clasp those of the French monarch. The next picture, at the bottom of the folio on which the letter begins, portrays a later moment of the ceremony, drawing its details directly from the description of homage in the letter. In this two-column miniature Edward kneels and places his hands, which are rendered in a scale larger than the rest of the image, within those of the French king. Aiding the French king is his chamberlain, dressed in a long, side-split mantle or <i>hérigaut</i> marked at the shoulder by three bands of white.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">119</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00081.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 82<br /> Edward III prepares for homage before Philip of Valois.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Nationale,<br /> Ms. fr. 2813, fol. 357.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00082.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 83<br /> Edward III's homage before Philip of Valois. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 2813, fol. 357v.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">120</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00083.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 84<br /> Edited rubric. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque<br /> Nationale, Ms. fr. 2813, fol. 357.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal">The moment represented in the three illustrations reinforces the political content of their texts. The miniature of Henry III's homage and the two miniatures of Edward III's homage all focus on the gesture of <i>immixtio manuum</i> (handclasp)—significantly, the moment at which the vassal was most abject. This may have been the reason for illustrating it rather than another moment, such as the <i>osculum</i> (kiss). Also significant is the chamberlain's action in Edward's homage, for it marks the instant at which the English king swears the oath and thus submits to French authority. The presence of witnesses in all the miniatures verifies this act of submission.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup></p><p class="normal">Additional visual details further stress the English king's submission to his French lord. In all three miniatures the English king wears a heavy gold crown, although the ceremony demands that the person swearing homage be bareheaded. This deviation was doubtless employed to identify both Henry III and Edward III. Indeed, contemporary illustrations of homage such as those decorating Charles's manuscript of the <i>Homages du comtè de Clermont</i> , known through an eighteenth-century copy made for Roger de Gaigniéres, often identify figures through details of dress.<sup class="ref">[13]</sup> In the depiction of the homage of Louis II of Bourbon from this manuscript, for instance, court personages are easily identified by their arms. Further, Louis is not bareheaded while offering homage but wears a thin circlet. Nonetheless, it is tempting to see the addition of crowns to the standard English arms as yet another way of emphasizing the king's submission.<sup class="ref">[14]</sup> The English monarch paid homage in 1259 and 1329 as duke of Gascony and Poitou, not as king of England. His representation in royal regalia presents the event as the homage of a king rather than a duke.</p><p class="normal">One of a series of contemporary letters documenting the negotiations between Philip of Valois and Edward III, added during the second continuation of Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , describes the ceremonies of plain and liege homage, clearly demonstrating that the only distinction between the two ceremonies was the wording of the oath.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup> The events represented in the added miniatures—the chamberlain's speech for the French king and the <i>immixtio manuum</i> —could therefore have been part of either ceremony. Yet the submission symbolized by the gesture of <i>immixtio manuum</i> seems to have been as important</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">121</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">an issue in the late fourteenth century as the propriety of liege or plain homage had been at the beginning of Philip of Valois's reign. Writers who favored the English side challenged Valois legitimacy by denying that the English king had performed this symbolic gesture, despite the fact that duplicates of the homage documents were available in England. Froissart, in a redaction of his chronicle, possibly identical to that presented in 1361 to the English queen, Philippa of Hainault, included this account of Edward III's homage before Philip of Valois: "The king Edward of England did homage by mouth [i.e., kiss] and words only, without putting his hands between the hands of the king of France."<sup class="ref">[16]</sup> A little later he asserted, "Many murmur in England that their lord was closer to the heritage of France than was king Philip."<sup class="ref">[17]</sup></p><p class="normal">The textual source for Book I of Froissart's history—the chronicle of Jean le Bel—gives this account added significance,<sup class="ref">[18]</sup> for the description of homage is one of the few original passages that Froissart interpolated into Jean le Bel's text to produce the first redaction of his chronicle. Since this text was destined for the English queen, the interpolation of an original account questioning the legitimacy of the French ruling house doubtless reflects contemporary English political rhetoric and the importance of the <i>immixtio manuum</i> as a symbol of submission.</p><p class="normal">The inserted miniatures of homage thus function on three levels: they provide a clear illustration of the inserted documents; they underline the French view of the homage by emphasizing the gesture of submission and by identifying the participants through details of costume; and they illustrate Charles V's historic speech before his uncle, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, in 1378—a summary of which formed part of the continuation of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> written at the same time that the insertions were substituted into earlier portions of the manuscript.<sup class="ref">[19]</sup></p><p class="normal">This speech, given before the royal council and the university community, outlined a litany of English provocations justifying the French resumption of war. Charles V opened his discourse with a description of the two incidents of homage, which are painted with extraordinary care and added to the manuscript. He then discussed the Treaty of Brétigny and the letter of confirmation that outlined the renunciations to which the English agreed. He further explained how, at each turn, the English had broken their word; they aided Charles of Navarre and condoned the Black Prince's atrocities in France. He emphasized that the French continued, despite these breaches of faith, to send messengers beseeching the English to rectify matters. Finally, Charles concluded, his nation had no alternative but to resume war with the English.</p><p class="normal">The summary of Charles's speech places great emphasis on proof of his assertions. References to documents shown to the emperor appear throughout. For example, the emperor was shown the "letters on this matter" (the letter of 1331 on homage); the "other, older charters" in which the "kings of England renounced lands" (Treaty of Paris); and the "treaty of the peace" (Treaty of Brétigny). Almost all these texts either already appeared in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> or were inserted into Charles V's personal copy during Raoulet's second continuation.</p><p class="normal">Charles V's speech had an impact on other portions of the manuscript as well. Marginal notes added by Raoulet d'Orléans single out almost all the other events cited by Charles V in his discourse and described earlier in the <i> Grandes</i></p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">122</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><i>Chroniques</i> . Although <i>notas</i> are the most common form of annotation, detailed marginalia occasionally single out texts because of their relationship to the speech. One annotation even corrects a text (chapter 20) written during the second stage of execution, which states that the Black Prince imprisoned representatives of Charles V for a long time and "still holds them, in great contempt of the king and his sovereignty."<sup class="ref">[20]</sup> Next to this statement is a marginal note, underlined and framed by brown pen lines, which states, "Note: he had them killed."<sup class="ref">[21]</sup> This note updates the earlier continuation to conform with the version of the story given by Charles V in his speech when, in listing the excesses of the Black Prince, he said that the prince "had them taken and murdered evilly, against God and justice and in offense of the king and the realm of France."<sup class="ref">[22]</sup> This example is one of many that prove how carefully the director of the manuscript's layout underscored the relation between portions of text executed during the first and second stages of the manuscript and that portion written after the emperor's visit in 1378. The introduction of new texts containing specific images and the addition of complex marginal notes to texts already present in the manuscript draw attention to events and documents cited in Charles V's speech.</p><p class="normal">The third substitution of texts and images focuses exclusively on the problem of Valois legitimacy. In Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> the first chapter of the life of Philip of Valois substitutes, as Paulin Paris and Jules Viard note, a description of Philip's uncontested accession to the throne for the traditional discussion outlining English and Navarrese claims.<sup class="ref">[23]</sup></p><p class="normal">The care with which this alteration was accomplished is striking. Text, rubric, and illustration differ from their counterparts in all other <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . The miniature of the coronation of Philip of Valois at the head of the first chapter initially appears to be a logical choice for the first illustration to a king's reign (Fig. 85) and, understandably, has not attracted attention. Yet almost every other manuscript of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> postdating Charles's copy provides a different image and rubric. Instead of the coronation, events such as a discussion between barons, a homage, or a battle are most commonly illustrated.<sup class="ref">[24]</sup></p><p class="normal">A correction to the list of chapters dealing with Philip of Valois, which has been overlooked by compilers of critical editions of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , suggests that the text surviving in later manuscripts, and most often illustrated by the baronial debate, may also have been the original in Charles V's copy. At the beginning of the chapter list on a folio written by Henri de Trévou (Fig. 86) an unknown rubric for chapter 1 was carefully scraped and the coronation rubric substituted by Raoulet d'Orléans. This new rubric ("How Philip, Count of Valois, received the government of the realm and of his coronation") may in fact have replaced the same rubric as that found in later manuscripts ("The first chapter addresses the question of to whom the government of the realm should be entrusted").<sup class="ref">[25]</sup></p><p class="normal">Just as the changed rubric and text in Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> gloss over the difficult transition from Capetian to Valois, the new miniature also portrays a smooth transfer of power. By illustrating Philip of Valois's coronation, this miniature underlines his continuity with those who had reigned before. Few modern readers looking at the revised account in Charles V's manuscript would suspect that Philip's accession contributed to the Hundred Years' War.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">123</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00084.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 85<br /> Coronation of Philip of Valois. <i> Grandes Chroniques de<br /> France</i> . Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 2813, fol. 353v<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00085.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 86<br /> Chapter list, life of Philip of Valois. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 2813, fol. 352.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">124</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">The fourth insert, the frontispiece to the life of Saint Louis (Fig. 87), contains six scenes: the nativity of Saint Louis, the education of Saint Louis, Saint Louis's care for the leper monk at Royaumont, Saint Louis washing the feet of the poor, the burial of the crusaders' bones at Sidon, and Saint Louis's submission to scourging by his confessor. These images reflect the Valois interest in the royal saint,<sup class="ref">[26]</sup> glorifying him as the ancestor of the Capetian and Valois lines and thus reinforcing the theme of dynastic legitimacy conveyed by the other inserted texts and illuminations.</p><p class="normal">Like Philip of Valois and John the Good, Charles promoted dynastic legitimacy by invoking his direct Valois ancestors and his saintly Capetian ancestor, Louis.<sup class="ref">[27]</sup> To stress continuity within the new dynasty, Charles decided to be crowned on Trinity Sunday, as his grandfather had been.<sup class="ref">[28]</sup> In another expression of dynastic pride, undertaken shortly after his coronation, he commissioned tombs for both his grandparents, Philip of Valois and his first wife, Jeanne of Burgundy; his father, John the Good; himself; and his queen, Jeanne of Bourbon, to make the first three Valois kings visible near their Capetian, Carolingian, and Merovingian ancestors in the royal necropolis at Saint-Denis.<sup class="ref">[29]</sup></p><p class="normal">Even Charles's ordinance establishing the age of majority at 14 invoked Louis IX above other French kings. The text, whose publication in Parlement in 1375 was the subject of the last chapter of the second stage of execution of Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , cites Saint Louis among biblical and historical <i>exempla</i> of kings who assumed their majority at 14, even though historical evidence suggests that Louis IX was, in fact, 12 at the time.<sup class="ref">[30]</sup> A long passage in praise of Saint Louis as patron of France and as a model of good kingship follows.<sup class="ref">[31]</sup></p><p class="normal">The inserted frontispiece to the life of Saint Louis constitutes a part of this pervasive Valois tradition. Like many Capetian commissions and like John the Good's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , its textual source is the <i>Vie de Saint Louis</i> by Guillaume de Saint-Pathus. Although most of its imagery derives from Saint-Pathus as well, certain deviations from established iconography are distinctive.<sup class="ref">[32]</sup></p><p class="normal">The most innovative scene in the frontispiece, the nativity of Saint Louis, is the only miniature with no textual nor pictorial basis. Its inclusion establishes a relationship between the baby Louis and Charles V's infant son, later Charles VI, as he appears in the large two-column miniature of his baptismal procession from the chronicle's second stage of execution (Fig. 80). This comparison is relevant because Charles V and Jeanne of Bourbon had waited 18 years for the birth of their son. Their desire for an heir was strong enough to cause changes emphasizing fertility in the coronation <i>ordo</i> used in 1364.<sup class="ref">[33]</sup></p><p class="normal">Almost every other <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> that illustrates Charles VI as a baby also includes a portrait of his younger brother,<sup class="ref">[34]</sup> nor does any other <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> picture Saint Louis as an infant. By omitting a picture of the birth or baptism of Charles's second son, Louis, in 1372 and including a picture of an infant whose presence is not even demanded by the text, this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> establishes a connection between the dauphin Charles and Louis IX that underscores the expression of Capetian-Valois continuity in the insertions of homage and of the coronation of Philip of Valois.</p><p class="normal">A second scene in the frontispiece is more concerned with Louis's kingship than with his place in Valois genealogy.

The authority of Louis's royal dress, his prominent position under a baldachin with his teacher on a low bench before him, and the absence of his mother shift the emphasis to Louis's kingship and away from the more conventional presentation of the instruction of a prince. This altered focus may reflect a changing ideal of kingship under Charles V, who earned his sobriquet, "the Wise," through his scholarly pursuits and who was often cited along with Saint Louis in discussions of the education of a French king.<sup class="ref">[36]</sup></p><p class="normal">The fifth and final insert in Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is a miniature long thought to represent the coronation of Charles VI (Fig. 89).

Moreover, there is no evidence that an account of the coronation was ever there. Over 50 blank pages are ruled at the end of the manuscript with no sign that anything has been cut out. The simplest explanation may therefore be that this coronation scene was inserted, along with the other pages, in the third stage of execution of the manuscript. Indeed, it may have been planned to serve as a full-page frontispiece to the first volume of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , just as the inserted leaf with scenes from the life of Saint Louis acted as an extratextual frontispiece to the second volume of the chronicle.</p><p class="padded">The coronation miniature makes more sense in this context. It represents precisely the same moment chosen to introduce Charles V's life in his manuscript—the moment when the king is supported by the peers—but it serves a slightly different purpose here. In Charles V's life the image is packed with realistic details and heraldic charges, reflecting the specific problems with legitimacy and succession that Charles V faced in the 1370s. This frontispiece is more universal; it even includes spectators in the lower register. The fleur-de-lis drapery in the image of the monarch and in the background identifies the coronation as French, but no other figure in the scene is identified by heraldry. Instead, 12 blank shields are isolated on the ground in the lower margin, probably designed to receive the arms of the 12 peers who, according to tradition, assist in the ceremony. The image therefore celebrates France's sacred kingship and alludes to the peers' role, specified by Golein, in supporting and defending the king and the realm.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">The Visit of the Holy Roman Emperor</h3><p class="noindent">The description of the emperor's visit to Paris in 1378 is the most densely illuminated segment of text in Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[37]</sup> In this subcycle, 18 miniatures decorate 13 folios. They portray the visit from the arrival of the emperor's letter announcing his impending trip (fol. 464) to letters received at court after his departure (fol. 480). The action between concentrates on ceremony. In this portion of the chronicle, text and image together emphasize the preeminence of the French over the emperor. For example, two miniatures illustrate the chapter in which the emperor stayed in the imperial city of Cambrai at the insistence of Charles's messengers, so that he could play his customary imperial role in the religious ceremony celebrated at Christmas without interfering with Charles's kingly role. The first miniature shows the pomp of his entry into Cambrai and the second his part in the celebration of the Christmas mass. The <i>Grandes Chroniques's</i> text makes the issue clear: "Because the emperor customarily said the seventh lesson at matins, dressed in his imperial clothes and insignia, he was advised by the king's men that he could not and would not be permitted to do this in the king's realm."<sup class="ref">[38]</sup> The second miniature shows the imperial ceremony in such detail that the first few words of the seventh lesson, which the emperor declaimed, are inscribed on the book placed on the podium.<sup class="ref">[39]</sup></p><p class="normal">Other miniatures in this section of text are notable for their scale as well as for their close relation to their texts. For instance, a sequence of three miniatures (fols. 469, 470, 470v) illustrates the emperor's approach to Paris, the meeting of emperor and king, and their entry into Paris; the miniatures increase in size from</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">129</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00089.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 90<br /> Entry of Charles V, Charles IV, and Wenceslaus into Paris.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .Bibliothèque Nationale,<br /> Ms. fr. 2813, fol. 470v.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal">one and one-half columns, to two columns, to three-quarters of a page.<sup class="ref">[40]</sup> As in the picture of the emperor in Cambrai, these images stress French ascendancy. The <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> records that Charles V, in order to emphasize the ban on imperial signs on French soil, purposefully chose dark horses, rather than the white ones traditionally given to emperors, for Charles IV and his son Wenceslaus when they met the French king outside Paris. In the illustration of the entry (Fig. 90) the emperor and his son ride dark horses while Charles V sits astride a white horse and wears a crown in place of the hat required by the text.<sup class="ref">[41]</sup> It is likely that this detail of costume was introduced to emphasize Charles's equality with the Holy Roman Emperor.</p><p class="normal">The largest and most problematic miniature in the subcycle of the imperial visit is that of the Great Feast (Fig. 91). This picture, along with the Order of the Star miniature discussed in Chapter 6, is one of only two illustrations in Charles V's manuscript referred to directly in its accompanying text. As in the image of the Order of the Star, the passage preceding the miniature of the Great Feast refers explicitly to the picture that follows: "And thus they went without a great hurry . . . to the large dais with the marble table and the grouping of figures and</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">130</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00090.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 91<br /> Great Feast. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 2813, fol.<br /> 473v. Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">131</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">their positions were as described below and as is figured in the miniature hereafter portrayed."<sup class="ref">[42]</sup> With the exception of a few simplifications required to depict a large crowd in a small area, the illustration conforms to the description of the diners that begins just below the picture. It records the positions of Emperor Charles IV, Charles V, Wenceslaus, and the bishops who dined with them. The representation of the play, which fills the right side and the foreground of the miniature, however, contains elements not specified by the text. The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> states that the play was about the history of Godfrey of Bouillon and the conquest of Jerusalem. It speaks of Peter the Hermit, of Godfrey, and of the "noble knights who were at the conquest of Jerusalem," but it does not identify these knights. The picture, however, includes four sets of arms, on the boat and on the individual knights who storm Jerusalem: Godfrey of Bouillon's arms are at the stern of the ship at the far left, England's are on a spear, Auvergne's on the mast, and Flanders's at the bow.</p><p class="normal">Contemporary descriptions of this crusade demonstrate that the storming of Jerusalem portrayed in the miniature includes at least two anachronisms. Godfrey was not king during the assault on Jerusalem; he was crowned later.<sup class="ref">[43]</sup> Further, the counts of Flanders and Auvergne participated in the assault, but the king of England was not there. Instead, his brother, Robert of Normandy, took part.<sup class="ref">[44]</sup> Artistic error alone cannot explain the latter discrepancy; besides adding an extra lion to the arms of Normandy, thus transforming Normandy's two lions into England's three, the artist also placed a crown on the head of the figure who bears these arms and stands at the foot of the ladder outside Jerusalem's walls. Clearly the artist intended to portray the king of England.<sup class="ref">[45]</sup></p><p class="normal">The description that the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> gives for selecting this play provides a possible explanation for these changes. According to the chronicle, the king chose to have the story of Godfrey of Bouillon performed because he believed that there was no better example to put before the noblest men in Christendom who "were best able, ought, and should undertake such a feat in the service of God."<sup class="ref">[46]</sup> Taken at face value, this statement suggests that the play was intended to kindle crusading fervor in those who watched it. This is difficult to prove, since there is little evidence that Charles V was ever seriously interested in a crusade.<sup class="ref">[47]</sup></p><p class="normal">A comparison of this image with that of the Order of the Star suggests a different explanation for its prominence in the manuscript. Not only are the miniatures of the Order of the Star (Fig. 76) and the Great Feast (Fig. 91) thematically related, they are also large in scale, occupying three-quarters of a manuscript page; they incorporate elements not described in the chronicle; and they are the only two miniatures in the manuscript to be referred to explicitly by their texts. It is possible that the picture of the Great Feast, painted in the third stage of execution, was designed to refer back to the Order of the Star, painted in the second stage, just as other miniatures and texts from the third stage refer back to the second.</p><p class="normal">As we have seen, the miniature of the Order of the Star celebrates John the Good and French chivalry and, by contrast, denigrates the English whose treachery is the actual subject of the text it illustrates.<sup class="ref">[48]</sup> Given the relationship between these miniatures, it is reasonable to suggest that the Great Feast may have had a similar function within the framework of the imperial visit. The portrayal of the English king in the capture of Jerusalem when it was known that he did not participate</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">132</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">suggests that its function was to convey a message about England similar to the message conveyed in Charles V's speech.<sup class="ref">[49]</sup></p><p class="normal">One of Charles's goals for the imperial visit was to persuade the Holy Roman Emperor to condemn England's actions in the Hundred Years' War. The plea he delivered before the emperor the night after the state dinner at which the play was performed (and recorded in the text of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> two chapters after the description of the dinner), presented a litany of dastardly English deeds that contrasted markedly with the portrayal of the English monarch in the play.<sup class="ref">[50]</sup> Charles described an English king who broke treaties and ordered the murder of emissaries, but the crusading play portrays a heroic English king assisting in a triumph over the infidel. Whether this idealized king is Richard the Lionheart, a hero of the Third Crusade, or simply an invention of the designer of the play or program of decoration is unimportant. His heroic stature emphasizes the evil of Edward III as Charles described him. This contrast between exemplary and reprehensible behavior in picture and text is very similar to that established by the Order of the Star miniature and text.</p><p class="normal">The portrayal of the arms of Flanders and Auvergne in the Great Feast miniature may constitute an additional contemporary reference. Of all the nobles who were with Godfrey when he stormed the walls of Jerusalem only the counts of Flanders and Auvergne accompany him in this miniature. They may have been selected because the counties of Flanders and Auvergne belonged to Philip, duke of Burgundy, and John, duke of Berry, two of Charles's brothers, who played important roles in the protocol of the emperor's state visit.<sup class="ref">[51]</sup> The depiction of their predecessors as counts in the play may have been a compliment to them.</p><p class="normal">By analyzing the three stages in the production of Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> we can thus chart the changing concerns of one French king. As first conceived, the book ended with the life of Philip of Valois and was illustrated with generalized pictures whose images reflect the young king's particular concerns: the history of his ducal predecessors in Normandy; his holy ancestors, Charlemagne and Saint Louis; the concept of legitimacy; and the idea of empire.</p><p class="normal">During the second stage of execution the text was expanded to include the reigns of John the Good and Charles V to the events of 1375. One series of pictures focuses on Charles's difficulties with Étienne Marcel and the Estates General and with Charles of Navarre, carefully incorporating detail drawn from the chronicle into illustrations that relate exclusively to their own texts. A second series of miniatures depicts ceremonies. These pictures not only illustrate events described in the text but also work together to develop dynastic themes—the promotion of John the Good as a model of good kingship and the assurance of Valois continuity in the person of the dauphin Charles.</p><p class="normal">Perhaps as a response to the worsening political situation in France, the use of miniatures of ceremony was more common during the third stage of execution. All but two of these illustrations assert French ascendancy over the empire. Finally, Valois legitimacy is emphasized by four illustrated texts and one full-page miniature executed during the third stage for substitution into the first portion of the manuscript.</p><p class="normal">Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is radically different from those versions that went before. Unlike its predecessors, it includes a continuation written at court that brings it up to the present and describes the acts of its patron. Perhaps</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">133</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">because Charles V was a politically astute monarch as well as a noted bibliophile, pictures and text in his <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> were altered almost every time the political situation changed. His chronicle therefore records events of his reign and reflects his changing political thought and contemporary French propaganda during a stressful time in French history. During Charles V's lifetime the book was probably available only to the king and a select group of courtiers. Nevertheless, this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> addresses the same issues as the more public celebrations of monarchial authority expressed in speeches, ordinances, or ceremonies.

Charles V had planned for a balanced government in which Charles VI's uncles, Philip of Burgundy and Louis of Anjou, would control separate areas and counter each other's ambitions until Charles was 14.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> Instead, the regency council was dominated by Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy, after Louis of Anjou departed for Naples in 1381. From Charles V's death until Charles VI finally took control in 1388, the French dukes entrusted with the regency concentrated more on promoting their own interests than on serving the state.</p><p class="normal">When Charles attained his majority in 1388, the structure of government changed. The young king turned away from the dukes and toward advisors who had worked for his father; these counsellors began to provide stability and continuity in policy. However, shortly after he began to rule independently, Charles was beset by a bout of mental illness in 1392.</p><p class="normal">This illness was perhaps the most important factor shaping the political climate of Charles VI's reign. He seemed to recover from his first <i>crise</i> by September of 1392 but had a second attack in June of 1393 that lasted until January 1394. This pattern of illness and remission continued; in 30 years Charles had about 43 "absences," as they were euphemistically called in the documents.</p><p class="normal">Charles's mental illness posed special problems for the court and the government of France. Frequently, when he was "absent," Charles did not know himself or his family. The dilemma that the court faced centered on the fact that, at least in the beginning, Charles seemed capable of governing between his attacks.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup> For a period of approximately 20 years—from the onset of the condition in 1392 until around 1414 when it overcame the king—the members of the French court had no way to gauge whether Charles could govern at any given time. The question of who should govern was of central importance, and there were diverse opinions as to the correct answer.</p><p class="normal">One solution would have had the royal heir act as regent, but Charles's sons were sickly. His first son, Charles, died in 1386 at the age of three months; his second son, also called Charles, died in 1401 at the age of 9; a third son, Louis of Guyenne, died in 1415 at 18; and a fourth, John of Touraine, died in 1417 at 17. The only son to survive Charles VI, another Charles, was disinherited in 1420. Thus government by the heir was possible only during the second decade of the fifteenth century, when Louis of Guyenne was dauphin.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">138</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">After the failure of a series of regency councils that governed for the underage dauphins, France succumbed in 1409 to a civil war.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> With the exception of Louis of Bourbon, an uncle of Charles VI who remained a royalist, most of the king's relatives and the members of the royal court joined one of two factions: the Burgundian, headed at first by Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, and then, after 1404, by Philip's son, John the Fearless; and the Orléanist, initially led by Charles VI's brother, Louis of Orléans, and, after Louis's assassination in 1407, by Louis's son, Charles of Orléans; by Charles's father-in-law, Bernard of Armagnac; and periodically by John of Berry.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup></p><p class="normal">By 1404 the political fight for control broadened to include the dauphins—especially Louis of Guyenne, who lived to be almost 19 years old—and the dauphin's mother and primary guardian, Queen Isabeau of Bavaria. Indeed, Louis became so powerful that by 1409 he was empowered to act in the king's stead when Charles was "absent."</p><p class="normal">The pattern of literary patronage also changed when Charles VI succeeded to the throne. Charles V had been a sophisticated literary patron whose commissions for translations or for the composition of new texts reflected his political thought.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup> Charles VI was very different from his father, apparently sharing none of his concern with political theory. As Monfrin notes, patronage at court during Charles VI's reign was more preoccupied with "responding to the private interest of individual patrons than with serving the intellectual formation of a group."<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> Louis of Orléans, Charles VI's brother, was the only member of the royal family whose patronage was influenced by Charles V's example. Louis commissioned copies of many of the political and literary texts translated for his father, in part to present himself as the logical choice as successor once Charles VI's illness made evident his inability to govern.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup> Even when politically motivated, Louis's commissions also responded to his private interests.</p><p class="normal">Jacques Krynen demonstrates how the model for the production of political literature during the time of Charles V altered under Charles VI. During the reign of Charles V,<sup class="ref">[8]</sup> members of the royal entourage wrote most of the polemical literature, frequently at the express command of the king. While Charles VI reigned, intellectuals outside the court joined those who worked for the court to produce a literature that focused on the person of the king. Especially noteworthy is the consistency of focus that Krynen found in these writings, whether notarial, courtly, or academic. None questioned Charles VI's ability to rule, despite his increasingly obvious insanity and the dire state of the country, where civil war raged and the Hundred Years' War with England dragged on. Rather, most political writers manifested a loyalty toward the monarchy and the person of the king that impelled them to seek new ways to strengthen the Christian kingship of France and to urge the powers who actually governed France—the princes of the blood, the queen, and the dauphin—to do the same.</p><p class="normal">By the early fifteenth century, political theory had become the province of the royal chancery or, less frequently, of the University of Paris. Tracts written by such authors as Jean de Montreuil, a member of the chancery, or by Jean Gerson, chancellor of the university, formulated the political rhetoric of the French government and the factions that battled for power within it.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup> These unillustrated tracts and sermons, rather than contemporary copies of the chronicle, are the successors to the political program of Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">139</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">For example, Jean de Montreuil's <i>Traité contre les anglais</i> of 1413 built upon the political arguments first formulated in Charles V's 1378 speech before the Holy Roman Emperor, adapting almost verbatim its repudiation of English pretensions to the French throne. Summarized in Charles V's <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> and subsequently in families E and F of the <i>Chronique abrégée</i> and Christine de Pizan's biography of Charles V, this speech remained the basis for anti-English treatises throughout the reign of Charles VI. A chancery dossier, the <i>Mémoire grossement abrégée</i> , compiled by Jean de Montreuil in 1390, preserves the inverted chronological structure established by Charles V's speech, discussing Edward III's homage to Philip of Valois before Henry III's homage to Saint Louis. It then cites the "c'est assavoir" clause in the Treaty of Brétigny, which was annotated in Charles V's manuscript, and the Black Prince's killing of Palot and Chaponval, the imprisoned representatives of Charles V. Subsequently, this chancery dossier became one of the sources for the <i>Traité contre les anglais</i> , which exists in two French redactions and one Latin redaction dating between 1413 and 1416.<sup class="ref">[10]</sup></p><p class="normal">Other authors, like Christine de Pizan or Philip de Mézières, shared Jean Gerson's firm belief in the monarchy.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup> The work of these royalists exhorted the king to encourage good government and counseled the queen and princes of the fleur-de-lis to work for peace and for the good of France. Christine de Pizan's writings in particular focus on themes that became important in copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> produced during the second half of Charles VI's reign.</p><p class="normal">The pictures in <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> manuscripts produced from the 1380s through the first quarter of the fifteenth century parallel the literary development Krynen describes. After an initial period in which royal and courtly manuscripts imitated the chronicle produced for Charles V, books created for all levels of patronage began to concentrate on the monarchy. The sheer number of manuscripts that survive from this era attests to the transformation of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> from royal history to national history. Cycles of illustration range from the mass-produced to the carefully crafted, yet all celebrate the <i> religion royale</i> . Although none question Charles VI's ability to govern, a small group recognize the realities of government during the latter years of Charles VI's reign and introduce pictorial models that establish precedents for the involvement of the dukes, queen, and dauphins in government.</p><p class="normal">A handful of <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> produced in the last quarter of the fourteenth century are conservative, drawing from Charles V's manuscript for both the layout and content of their miniatures.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup> Although closely related, the cycles from these manuscripts differ significantly from Charles V's chronicle. None emulate the sophisticated layering of miniatures that added to the political content in Charles's codex, even though the editor of at least one of them clearly understood the structure of Charles V's book, whose text he copied.</p><p class="normal">The earliest <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (B.N. fr. 10135) from this group belonged to Charles VI and was probably painted for him during Charles V's lifetime, since the Master of the Coronation of Charles VI, the artist of the frontispiece of this manuscript, painted several miniatures in the third stage of Charles V's <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> . Its cycle is almost identical to Charles V's as it appeared at the end of the first stage of execution. Of all the manuscripts based on Charles V's book, it alone copies the frontispiece with its anti-imperial overtones and the dense cycle illustrating the life of Saint Louis, the saintly model for French kingship. It thus</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">140</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">shares the emphasis on French independence and on royal models that dominates Charles V's book prior to 1375.</p><p class="normal">Because this chronicle was probably presented to Charles VI while he was dauphin, it provides insights into the education of a prince during the late fourteenth century. Its text offers historical models for the royal heir, while its pictures provide ideological models based on certain concerns of Charles V. These images thus serve a purpose similar to that of Philip de Mézières's <i>Songe du vieil pelerin</i> or Christine de Pizan's <i>Livre des fais et bonnes meurs du sage roi Charles V</i> , which are in part panegyrics on Charles V written during the early years of Charles VI's reign and designed to encourage good government.<sup class="ref">[13]</sup></p><p class="normal">Three other copies of the chronicle (B.N. fr. 2608; Vienna, ÖNB 2564; and Lyon, B.M. 880), painted in the 1390s or in the early years of the fifteenth century, show how important the model of Charles V was to Charles VI and the court even 10 to 15 years after his death. On the basis of their iconography, these three books form a group that differs in pictorial content from Charles V's manuscript.</p><p class="normal">The most important manuscript (B.N. fr. 2608) from this group was painted for Charles VI after he became king. Significantly, it is the only chronicle whose text demonstrably copies Charles V's manuscript, but does not do so indiscriminately. Indeed, the way in which the editor incorporates some of the marginal notes relating to Charles V's speech proves that sophisticated readers understood the complex interrelationship of text and images in Charles V's book but did not necessarily find it relevant to their needs.<sup class="ref">[14]</sup> Because Charles VI's manuscript contains the shortened description of the emperor's visit in 1378, omitting the royal speech, the scribe copied only those notes that were comprehensible in the text of the shortened chronicle. He also transcribed marginal annotations commenting on select clauses in a letter from the English king (Charles V, ch. 13) but omitted the charters about homage and their illustrations, the note recording the deaths of the messengers sent to the Black Prince, and the note concluding that the French were justified in recommencing war with England. These notes and the substituted texts and miniatures on homage in Charles V's manuscript had provided documentation for the content of Charles V's speech; in a manuscript without the summary of the speech they would have been superfluous.</p><p class="normal">Although the designer of Charles VI's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (B.N. fr. 2608) had access to Charles V's complex program and understood it, he chose to omit much of it and focus instead on Saint Louis, as had Charles VI's earlier chronicle (B.N. fr. 10135). He used Charles V's manuscript as a guide for the layout of illustrations. Of the 76 miniatures in B.N. fr. 2608, only 15 do not copy images in Charles V's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Yet, in many ways, what was left out of this illustrative program is as telling as what was included. Most images dealing with Charles V's rise to power and with English strife were omitted, perhaps because France was negotiating peace with England throughout the 1390s. Indeed, the English scenes that do appear are almost laudatory. They include the English encounter with the French outside Reims (fol. 481v); the Treaty of Brétigny (fol. 483v); and the coronation of Richard II (fol. 521v), Charles VI's future son-in-law.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup></p><p class="normal">The most innovative aspect of the decorative cycle in Charles VI's second copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is its emphasis on Saint Louis, a focus it shares with earlier books produced for Charles V and Charles VI but handles very differently. Two iconic images of Louis IX in this chronicle stress special qualities of French government. The most distinctive is an illustration to the prologue (Fig. 92) in</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">141</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00091.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 92<br /> Presentation of chronicle to Saints Louis and Denis. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 2608. fol. 1. Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">142</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">which a monk kneels to present the chronicle to Saint Louis and Saint Denis. Although he is not portrayed in the scene of presentation, Charles VI is alluded to on this folio, since the crowned arms of <i>France moderne</i> appear at the bottom of the page supported by two <i>cerfs volants</i> , winged stags, a favorite emblem of the king in the 1380s and 1390s.<sup class="ref">[16]</sup> The scene of presentation to the two saints is one of the few scenes that do not appear in the model. In fact, among all the copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> that I have inspected, it is the only scene to represent a presentation of the book to someone other than the king.</p><p class="normal">On one level the inclusion of these two saints is not surprising. Throughout the Middle Ages, Saint Denis was both a royal and a national saint.<sup class="ref">[17]</sup> Indeed, the prologue that this scene illustrates represents Saint Denis's protection of France as a reward for France's holiness. Even if Saint Louis failed to achieve the same level of national popularity, his cult was strong in the Parisian basin, and he was a royal model for government.<sup class="ref">[18]</sup> The pairing of these saints can thus be seen as an expression of royal and national devotion.</p><p class="normal">Yet Louis IX had rarely been associated with Saint Denis in a visual context before this image. To my knowledge, the miniature in Charles VI's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> constitutes one of the earliest secular examples of Saint Denis and Saint Louis paired alone. When they do appear together, they are most frequently portrayed as protectors of the French royal house in politically charged religious images dating from the reign of John the Good to that of Charles VII.<sup class="ref">[19]</sup> In this miniature, however, the saints replace the king, a substitution that must have been particularly appropriate during Charles VI's absences in the 1390s.</p><p class="normal">Saint Denis had long been considered the protector of royal health, a responsibility in which Saint Louis, as royal saint, participated. As early as 1335 when Charles VI's grandfather, John, duke of Normandy, was ill, relics of Christ and Saint Louis preserved at Saint-Denis were credited with his cure.<sup class="ref">[20]</sup> In 1392 Charles VI himself gave a <i>châsse</i> to house relics of Saint Louis to the abbey of Saint-Denis in thanks for intervention in his illness. Thus while the substitution of these saints for the king in the scene of presentation in Charles VI's book certainly evokes the idea of holy sponsorship of the history contained in the manuscript, it may also evoke the idea of heavenly protection for the king who was so often "absent"—both from this picture of presentation and from his people.</p><p class="normal">The second picture of Saint Louis (Fig. 93) at the beginning of Louis's life simultaneously glorifies the holy patron of France and sacred character of French kingship. Nimbed and crowned, Saint Louis sits on a faldstool and holds a scepter topped by a fleur-de-lis as two praying angels hover to either side. Although it is customary for kings to hold scepters when enthroned in state, the gesture is given special importance in this picture where Saint Louis clasps his scepter in a cloth-draped hand.</p><p class="normal">No precise textual source explains Louis's gesture, which signals the sacredness of the symbol of his rule. Although the second chapter of Louis's life describes his coronation, the description does not explain the presence of the angels, the halo, or the holiness of the symbol of government—the scepter topped by a fleur-de-lis. The closest source in the chronicle for this picture is a passage in Louis's life that explains the significance of the fleur-de-lis and describes how crucial the virtues symbolized by its three leaves are for good government: "The leaf which is in the middle symbolizes Christian faith for us, and the other two beside it</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">143</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00092.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 93<br /> Saint Louis enthroned. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 2608. fol. 311v.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal">symbolize learning and chivalry which should always be prepared to defend the Christian faith. And as long as these three—faith, learning, and chivalry—reside in France, the realm of France will be strong and firm, full of wealth and honor."<sup class="ref">[21]</sup></p><p class="normal">The image at the beginning of Louis's life thus merges two ideas: the concept that the French king was the <i>rex christianissimus</i> who governed a holy realm and the idea that the fleur-de-lis, miraculously given to the French, confirmed God's favor. Both ideas had formed part of French political theory since the reign of the last Capetians, but they emerged with special power in the writings of the university community during the reign of Charles VI, most notably in Jean Gerson's letters and sermons written during the 1390s.<sup class="ref">[22]</sup></p><p class="normal">The theme of France's holy kingship and the exhortation to good government implicit in this iconic miniature differ from the emphasis on Louis's life as a model of kingship presented by the pictures in Charles V's manuscript and in Charles VI's earlier copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (B.N. fr. 10135). Both earlier books present several facets of Louis's life as models. For instance, the inserted frontispiece to the life of Saint Louis in Charles V's manuscript (Fig. 87) presents Louis as a model of kingship, of devotion, and of charity and is thus an appropriate introduction to the pictorial cycle in that chronicle. The iconic picture of Saint Louis from Charles</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">144</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">VI's later copy of the chronicle, on the other hand, draws the reader's attention to the themes of good government and the ideals of kingship that were important in the era when Charles VI took control of the government only to fall ill.</p><p class="padded">A brief consideration of the other two manuscripts from this group of three reinforces the special nature of the representations of Saints Denis and Louis in the king's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . One of the manuscripts (Vienna, ÖNB 2564) that copied Charles VI's book belonged to John of Montaigu, the <i> grand-maître</i> of France under Charles VI.<sup class="ref">[23]</sup> The second (Lyon, B.M. 880) was probably also a courtly commission and may have been the direct model for John of Montaigu's book.<sup class="ref">[24]</sup> Although the pictorial layouts of these chronicles are almost identical to that in the king's manuscript, their individual miniatures differ significantly in content. Thus a traditional image of a monk composing the text replaces the presentation miniature with Saint Louis and Saint Denis, and many of the supernatural and holy elements of the miniature from the beginning of Saint Louis's life are suppressed. Clearly, the images featuring Saint Louis were seen as particularly appropriate for the king, since in the rest of their cycles these two manuscripts copied Charles VI's book closely. Indeed, the interrelationship of the cycles in these three copies of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> signals the continued authority of royal copies of history early in the reign of Charles VI.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">145</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter Nine—<br /> Popular Manuscripts and the <i>Religion Royale</i></h2><p class="noindent">While Charles V's and Charles VI's lavish manuscripts were garnering a limited courtly following, less costly copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> were being produced by booksellers for the growing Parisian book trade. First owners are known with certainty for only two surviving manuscripts: one book (Ste.-Gen. 783) belonged to Regnault d'Angennes, the chamberlain of the dauphin, Louis of Guyenne; and a second (B.N. fr. 6466–67) was presented to John of Berry by Jean de la Barre, the receiver general of finance in Languedoc and the duchy of Guyenne.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> If these are representative owners, then they did not differ radically from the owners of manuscripts that copied royal models.</p><p class="normal">Illustrations in manuscripts produced for the book trade are independent of royal models and of one another. Perhaps because the royal library was out of bounds for the average Parisian bookseller, each editor seems to have developed new solutions to the problem of illustrating the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> . Yet these manuscripts do have some elements in common. They have shorter cycles of decoration, which average between 30 and 50 miniatures and often have a looser relationship to their text than the cycles in royal manuscripts or those based on royal models. Miniatures in these cycles almost always mark the beginning of a king's reign and frequently illustrate a vivid story from one of the chapters. For instance, the beginning of the fifth book of the chronicle is illustrated in two iconographical groups by a picture of King Dagobert supervising the construction of the abbey of Saint-Denis, an event recounted in the ninth chapter. In some groups miniatures have little textual basis; in others they are based on erroneous readings of the text. For instance, certain copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> transform the Empress Richilda, who presented a sword and scepter to Louis the Stammerer, into an emperor.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup></p><p class="normal">A comparison of three versions of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> —Valenciennes, B.M. 637, W. 138, and B.N. fr. 2604—offers a rare glimpse into the activities of the Parisian book trade at the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century, when Charles's illness had been recognized but an overt political struggle had not yet developed.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> These books, whose earliest owners are unknown, include a version of the chronicle that is related to Thomas of Maubeuge's early fourteenth-century manuscript, but they also provide a fully rubricated continuation to the accession of Charles VI in a version that had become</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">146</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00093.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 94<br /> Charlemagne presents Louis the Pious to a bishop.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Valenciennes,<br /> Bibliothèque Municipale, Ms. 637, fol. 134.<br /> Photograph: Bibliothèque Municipale, Valenciennes.</p><p class="normal">standard by the late fourteenth century. Furthermore, they share unconventional iconography whose subjects are described in notes to the illuminator preserved in the margins of the manuscript from Valenciennes.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup></p><p class="normal">A comparison of individual pictures not derived from their texts demonstrates the close relationship between the three cycles and these directions to the illuminator. For example, the Valenciennes miniature illustrating the life of Louis VII portrays a scene of homage that is never described in the life of that king but nonetheless appears in identical form in the book from Paris. Similarly, a peculiar illustration from the third book of Philip Augustus's life, which may illustrate the pope ordering Amaury de Bene to cease his heretical preaching, appears only in these three copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[5]</sup></p><p class="normal">Even the textually based pictures in these manuscripts are nearly identical. For instance, the picture introducing the life of Louis the Pious in the manuscripts from Valenciennes and Paris (Figs. 94 and 95) follows the directions recorded in the margins of the former manuscript: "How the king, accompanied by two nobles directly behind him, holds his young son by the hand and presents him to two bishops and the first [bishop] blesses him and behind him [the bishop]</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">147</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00094.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 95<br /> Charlemagne presents Louis the Pious to a bishop. <i> Grandes<br /> Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 2604, fol.<br /> 145. Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal">is a chaplain."<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> Furthermore, all three manuscripts have identical scenes for the first book of the life of Philip Augustus (Figs. 96 and 97), an image that was also described precisely by the marginal note: "An armed king without a helmet sits on a bench; many armed men with shields behind; right in front are three kneeling and bareheaded men who present swords by their points and cry for mercy."<sup class="ref">[7]</sup></p><p class="normal">The iconographical relationship between the three manuscripts is unquestionable, but the reason for the relationship is not totally clear. For instance, not every illustration in the three chronicles is based upon the Valenciennes notes; in the Valenciennes chronicle itself, 4 of 25 miniatures have no marginal directions; and in the Paris and Baltimore manuscripts 12 of 31 and 5 of 12 pictures, respectively, are independent of the directions preserved in the Valenciennes book.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup></p><p class="normal">Indeed, even scenes that derive unquestionably from the directions differ in detail from one book to another. This fact clearly rules out the possibility that one book copied another and suggests instead that each responded independently to similar instructions.

With one exception (Valenciennes, B.M. 637, fol. 154, completed by Valenciennes, Artist III), these artists worked in separate gatherings, so it is quite unlikely that they saw one another's work. The similarities in the iconographical programs of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in Valenciennes, Baltimore, and Paris are therefore better interpreted as productions supervised by the same <i>libraire</i> than as productions by artists working in the same workshop. Apparently the <i>libraire</i> who supervised these manuscripts maintained a master list of directions to <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> illuminators, part of which survives in the margins of the Valenciennes manuscript.</p><p class="normal">This <i>libraire</i> seems to have tailored his repertoire to the needs of his patrons. Individual images from these books may be identical, but their cycles are not. The manuscript in Baltimore, a fragment containing the second half of the chronicle,</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">150</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">contains miniatures at the beginning of each book that are as wide as a single column of text. The chronicle in Paris is complete, and its cycle follows a standard pattern with a four-part frontispiece and a single picture at major book divisions. The only deviation occurs within the first book of the chronicle, where a double miniature marks the chapter describing Clovis's baptism. The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in Valenciennes is the most elaborate cycle of this group. Its decoration includes two four-part miniatures and a two-column-wide miniature of early Merovingian rulers; it omits several miniatures from the reigns of the last Capetians that appear in the other two chronicles. The pattern of addition and omission in the Valenciennes chronicle places special emphasis on the lives of the early Merovingians and singles out Clovis, the first Christian king of France.</p><p class="normal">Although this unusual emphasis on Merovingian kings is difficult to explain, the emphasis on Clovis can be understood as a manifestation of the <i>religion royale</i> .<sup class="ref">[10]</sup> Exceptional miniatures in the manuscripts in Paris and Valenciennes illustrate events from Clovis's life.

Clovis is even more important in the book in Valenciennes; there the battle and baptism scenes are separated from their texts and combined to form a second frontispiece with pictures of Clovis and Clotilda enthroned and of Clovis's son, King Clodomir, supervising the execution of King Sigismund of Burgundy (Fig. 98). This new frontispiece to Book II of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> blends narratives from Book I and Book II to present an image of the founding and early years of the Christian kingdom of France. It thus constitutes a visual counterpart to the traditional frontispiece in the manuscript, showing the founding of France by Trojan refugees and the early years of the pagan kings of France (Fig. 99).<sup class="ref">[11]</sup></p><p class="normal">Clovis's status in the Paris and Valenciennes manuscripts reveals the strength and broad appeal of the <i>religion royale</i> at the turn of the century and emphasizes the importance of Clovis to its dissemination. Although Clovis had been revered as the model of a warrior king as early as 1300, he was more renowned as a model of good and just kingship and as a saint by the late fourteenth century. With the active encouragement of Charles V, Clovis's cult began to flourish. It was most popular during the reign of Charles V's grandson, Charles VII.

Beginning in the reign of Charles V, pictures in royal copies of the chronicle most frequently stressed the lives of Charlemagne and Louis IX, two saints from whom the Valois proudly claimed descent. Clovis and other Merovingian kings were rarely featured in the dynastic programs of royal manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> or, for that matter, in arguments asserting the legitimacy of the Valois line. For instance, when dynastic arguments are marshaled in <i>Le songe du vergier</i> to prove that France was established "according to God and the Holy Scriptures," the account begins with Pepin. Although the <i>Songe</i> mentions the holy unction, it attempts to prove legitimacy by the sanctity of the Valois kings' Carolingian and Capetian ancestors; thus it omits Clovis.<sup class="ref">[13]</sup></p><p class="normal">For the Valois kings of the late fourteenth century, Clovis's significance lay predominantly in the fact that the holy unction, which first appeared at his baptism and which signaled divine sanction for his reign, was used at the coronations of later French kings, including the Valois monarchs. Thus in royal texts written at the time of Charles V references to Clovis are confined almost exclusively to discussions of the sacred symbols of French monarchy, as for instance in the preface to the translation of Augustine's <i>City of God</i> or in Jean Golein's <i>Traité du sacre</i> .<sup class="ref">[14]</sup></p><p class="normal">Conversely, such popular commissions as the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in Valenciennes sought to glorify French kingship rather than justify Valois legitimacy. As a result, they broke from the royal dynastic tradition and focused special pictorial attention on Clovis as the first of the long line of Christian kings of France.</p><p class="normal">Image not available</p><p class="caption">Plate 1<br /> Coronation of Pharamond. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . British<br /> Library, Royal 16 G VI, fol. 3. By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal">Image not available</p><p class="caption">Plate 2<br /> Pagan and Christian kings of France. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque<br /> Royale, Ms. 5, fol. 1. Copyright Bibliothèque Royale Albert Ier, Brussels.</p><p class="normal">Image not available</p><p class="caption">Plate 3<br /> Battle of Courtrai. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Castres, Bibliothèque<br /> Municipale, fol 353v. Photograph: Bibliothèque Municipale, Castres.</p><p class="normal">Image not available</p><p class="caption">Plate 4<br /> Peers support the crowns of Charles V and Jeanne of Bourbon. <i> Grandes Chroniques de<br /> France</i> . Bibliothèque Nationale, Ms. fr. 2813, fol. 439. Photograph: Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris.</p><p class="normal">Image not available</p><p class="caption">Plate 5<br /> Peers support the crown of Charles V. <i> Coronation Book</i> . British Library,<br /> Cotton Tiberius B VIII, fol. 59v. By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal">Image not available</p><p class="caption">Plate 6<br /> Peers support the crown of Jeanne of Bourbon. <i> Coronation Book</i> . British<br /> Library, Cotton Tiberius B VIII, fol. 70. By permission of the British Library.</p><p class="normal">Image not available</p><p class="caption">Plate 7<br /> Trojan fugitives at sea (Helenos, Aeneas, and Antenor?); Presentation of book to Charles<br /> VI. <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Pierpont Morgan Library, M. 536, fol. 2. ©The Pierpont<br /> Morgan Library 1991.</p><p class="normal">Image not available</p><p class="caption">Plate 8<br /> Abduction of Helen; Punishment of Troy; Flight of the Trojans; Presentation<br /> of book to Charles VI. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Berlin, Deutsche Staatsbibliotek,<br /> Phill. 1917, fol. 1. Photograph: Deutsche Staatsbibliotek Berlin.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">153</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2B">Chapter Ten—<br /> Advice to the Nobility in Manuscripts Produced in the Style of the Master of the <i>Cité des Dames</i></h2><p class="noindent">A second group of manuscripts, painted for the nobility and members of the court in the style of the Master of the <i> Cité des Dames</i><sup class="ref">[1]</sup> during the early fifteenth century, are noteworthy for their response to contemporary events rather than any generalized ties to the <i>religion royale</i> . Their designers seem to have taken the admonition of the prologue to heart; in a pictorial program tied strongly to the complex and unsettled history of early fifteenth-century France, they guide the reader to "find good and evil, the beautiful and ugly, sense and folly, and to profit from all [this] through the example of history."<sup class="ref">[2]</sup></p><p class="normal">The Master of the <i>Cité des Dames</i> popularized a new mode of courtly illustration during the latter part of the reign of Charles VI. One reason for his popularity in courtly circles was probably his realistic style; he could evoke the interiors where the courtiers lived and the clothing and political emblems that they loved to wear,<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> yet he could also strip settings and costumes to their essential elements if that was more appropriate to the cycle.</p><p class="normal">Books produced by the Master of the <i>Cité des Dames</i> are an ideal source for exploring the kind of political guidance given to the nobility during the period of the French civil war. Four cycles by this artist survive, dating approximately from 1405 to 1415: Mazarine 2028, c. 1405–08; Phillipps 1917, c. 1409–10/15; M. 536, c. 1410–12; and B.R. 3, c. 1410–15.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> The number of cycles in this style makes it relatively easy to screen out stock workshop scenes and concentrate instead on pictures that were specially tailored for one or more of these manuscripts. Analyzed in this way, the pictures clearly offer varied but timely advice to those charged with ensuring stable government in France—advice similar to that written by partisans of the political parties and by moderates like Christine de Pizan and Jean Gerson.</p><p class="normal">Manuscripts produced for the court by the Master of the <i> Cité des Dames</i> diverge from the pattern of illustration in such royal copies as Philip III's, John the Good's, or Charles V's, whose carefully coordinated pictures and texts together convey a political message. They differ too from courtly commissions whose pictures bear a looser relationship to their text and work to reinforce general royalist or universal themes in the chronicle. In the new mode, important political commentary appears in manuscripts made for the princes of the blood or for their supporters.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">154</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">In the most sophisticated of these books, exemplified here by a chronicle in New York (M. 536), the text is edited to emphasize Burgundian interests, and the pictures form a tightly woven cycle that provides an independent counterpoint to the text. This appropriation of an illustrational mode hitherto restricted to royal copies of the chronicle provides an interesting parallel to political developments in France, where the queen and the princes of the blood were increasingly involved in royal government (and thus in the kind of history traditionally recorded in the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> ) and where writers independent of the court sought to preserve the monarchy.</p><p class="normal">The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> now in Berlin (Phillipps 1917) differs radically from that in New York. Its text is conventional, and its illustrations incorporate fifteenth-century political devices and emblems into historical images to provide a commentary on the present. This method of glossing illustration to make a political statement is only as sophisticated as the editor of the book chooses to make it.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup></p><p class="padded">Not all the manuscripts painted by the Master of the <i> Cité des Dames</i> are illustrated in such innovative ways. Some, like the manuscripts in Paris (Mazarine 2028) and Brussels (B.R. 3), have more in common with courtly books from earlier periods. They contain some illustrations whose unusual subject matter relates to contemporary politics, but even these show the concern with preserving the monarchy that characterizes political literature of the early fifteenth century.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">The Role of the Princes of the Blood</h3><p class="noindent">The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> of circa 1410–12 in New York (M. 356) has the most secure connections with one of the two partisan groups, the Burgundian and the Orléanist parties, as textual evidence demonstrates. Although this <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> has no <i>ex libris</i> and is not listed in any surviving inventory from royal or ducal collections, certain textual peculiarities find their closest analogies in an unillustrated copy of the chronicle (B.R. 4) that belonged to Philip the Bold of Burgundy and remained in the Burgundian library after his death in 1404.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> Both the illustrated chronicle in New York and the unillustrated one in Brussels incorporate a Latin poem at the end of Saint Louis's life that occurs elsewhere only in royal copies of the chronicle. Further, both extend the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> past its usual ending by appending a continuation of Guillaume de Nangis. In this pair of manuscripts alone, the chronicle ends with a description of the death in 1384 of the count of Flanders, the Burgundian dukes' predecessor as ruler of Flanders. Finally, both these books and no others condense the description of one of the most important royal events of the late fourteenth century—the visit of the Holy Roman Emperor to Charles VI's father, Charles V—from 12 chapters to 20 lines of text.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup></p><p class="normal">Although the manuscript from Berlin (Phillipps 1917) contains the standard version of the text of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , its provenance suggests that it too was made in a Burgundian milieu. Arms added to the initial on folio 1 are those of a member of the Rolin family, which was active in Burgundian service. The most prominent member of this family, Nicholas Rolin, was employed by Philip the Bold; entered the service of Philip's son, John the Fearless, in 1408, working as counsellor, lawyer, and <i> maître des requêtes</i> ; and became chancellor of Burgundy under John's son, Philip the Good, in 1422.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup></p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">155</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">The pictures in these Burgundian <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> emphasize the governmental role of the French dukes—Charles VI's brother and uncles—and stress dynastic themes. These concerns are most evident in the frontispiece shared by M. 536 and Phillipps 1917 and in the distinctive form in which both manuscripts represent coronations. It is striking, then, that while pictures may convey parallel messages in these chronicles, they do so through two distinct modes of illustration.</p><p class="normal">Most frequently, frontispieces to the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> portray stories from the fall of Troy and the foundation by Trojan refugees of the kingdom that later became France. Visual solutions to the problem of illustrating these stories vary even in the <i> oeuvre<sup class="ref">[*]</sup> of the Cité des Dames</i> shop. For instance, the frontispiece (Fig. 100) from a copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in Paris, which will be discussed in more detail later, concentrates exclusively on the flight from Troy. Frontispieces from M. 536 (Plate 7) and Phillipps 1917 (Plate 8) break from this tradition by making allusions that have no textual basis but are decidedly biased toward the Burgundian party. Both frontispieces contain three scenes from the Trojan story that at first glance seem identical but are not. In Phillipps 1917 the abduction of Helen and the punishment of Troy are in the upper register. At the lower left the flight of Aeneas to Rome represents the survivors of Troy who scatter all over the earth. In contrast, the frontispiece in M. 536 concentrates exclusively on the aftermath of the destruction. It makes no reference to the abduction of Helen and does not represent the destruction of the city. Instead it shows a diverse group of fugitives at sea (Helenos, Aeneas, and Antenor?), ranging from a king and queen to members of the nobility and soldiers.</p><p class="normal">The fourth frames jump forward in time to show the presentation of a manuscript to Charles VI, an event with no textual basis. By juxtaposing the reigning king with scenes from Trojan history, these pictures promote the Trojan origin of the French line, which was accepted throughout the fifteenth century.<sup class="ref">[9]</sup> Further, since the text of the chronicle describes the exploits of French rulers in an unbroken chain stretching from Priam of Troy to Charles VI, these frontispieces introduce the whole book by giving visual form to the beginning and the end of this chain.</p><p class="normal">It is unlikely that either of these manuscripts was destined for Charles VI, even though they show him enthroned in the frontispiece. Indeed, in both images (Figs. 101 and 102) Charles is shown nostalgically, sitting on a throne under a canopy decorated in red, green, and white, the emblematic colors that Charles bore until 1392, the year his madness struck.<sup class="ref">[10]</sup> By the time these two manuscripts were made, Charles VI's colors were white, green, red, gold, and black, the colors represented in such presentation scenes as the frontispiece to the <i>Dialogues of Pierre Salmon</i> , a manuscript presented to Charles VI in 1411. Thus, instead of being shown in these <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> as he was in 1410–12, the approximate date for these manuscripts, Charles VI is shown as he was before his illness became debilitating, during the golden period of his reign.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup></p><p class="normal">Although these frontispieces derive from the same iconographic source, their iconography is used in very different ways. As we will see later, Phillipps 1917 further glosses the frontispiece and miniatures through the manuscript by including political devices. Perhaps because the text is more conventional in this book, its pictures had to carry the full weight of its message. On the other hand, the designer of M. 536, with its Burgundian version of the text, stripped scenes of all</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">156</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00099.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 100<br /> Flight from Troy. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Mazarine, Ms. 2028,<br /> fol. 2. Photograph: Bibliothèque Mazarine, Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">157</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00100.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 101<br /> Presentation of book to Charles VI. <i> Grandes Chroniques<br /> de France</i> . Pierpont Morgan Library, M. 536, fol. 2.<br /> Photograph courtesy of the Pierpont Morgan Library.</p><p class="normal"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00101.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 102<br /> Presentation of book to Charles VI. <i> Grandes Chroniques<br /> de France</i> . Berlin, Deutsche Staatsbibliothek, Phill. 1917,<br /> fol. 1. Photograph: Deutsche Staatsbibliothek Berlin.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">158</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00102.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 103<br /> Coronation of Charlemagne. <i> Grandes Chroniques de<br /> France</i> . Pierpont Morgan Library, M. 536, fol. 83v.<br /> Photograph courtesy of the Pierpont Morgan Library.</p><p class="normal">devices and emblems and relied instead on the cumulative effect of the whole cycle to convey its pictorial message.</p><p class="normal">In M. 536 broad themes organize the pictures. The reader is not led to recognize themes and interpretations of history by the nonverbal yet explicit use of emblems or devices. Instead his perception is formed subtly by an insistent repetition of subjects and, in a few miniatures, by the use of something as understated as a particularly striking background motif. In this way M. 536 promotes its timely theme—the return of France to good government—and presents the French dukes as the agents who will accomplish this feat.</p><p class="normal">Two miniatures in M. 536, central to the content of the program, are the coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo (Fig. 103) and the coronation of Louis VIII and Blanche of Castile (Fig. 104). Charlemagne's coronation is a standardized scene, identical iconographically to that in Phillips 1917 (Fig. 105). The most innovative feature of the version in the Morgan Library is its background, where an elaborate checkerboard pattern is formed by blue lozenges, each containing a tiny fleur-de-lis.

Thus, in the coronations of Philip V, Charles V (Fig. 107), and Charles, VI, French dukes assume active roles as king-makers. The power of the ducal presence intensifies with each repetition of the basic composition in a cumulative and deliberate effect. The stress on dukes in coronations in this manuscript differs from that given the same scenes in the Parisian copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Fig. 108) where, for instance, the illustration of Charles V's coronation, like that of Louis VIII, emphasizes the agency of the clergy. Miniatures in M. 536 differ from those in the Brussels manuscript, where, instead of a coronation, a picture like that introducing the life of Charles V (Fig. 109) emphasizes both the king's power and a moment of Burgundian history in which Charles invested his brother, Philip the Bold, with the duchy of Burgundy.</p><p class="normal">The Burgundian manuscript in the Morgan Library may have a partisan text, but its pictorial message is moderate, claiming only that the dukes have a role in governing France. Pictures in Phillipps 1917 convey a similar message but are more biased. This manuscript, executed in the first decade of the fifteenth century, predates Louis of Guyenne's assumption of power and contains pictures glossed with references to the Burgundian-Orléanist conflict that take a decidedly Burgundian stance.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">162</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00107.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 108<br /> Coronation of Charles V and Jeanne of Bourbon. <i> Grandes Chroniques<br /> de France</i> . Bibliothèque Mazarine, Ms. 2028, fol. 427v.<br /> Photograph by the author.</p><p class="normal"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00108.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 109<br /> Charles invests Philip the Bold with the<br /> duchy of Burgundy. <i>Grandes<br /> Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque<br /> Royale, Ms. 3, fol. 414v. Copyright<br /> Bibliothèque Royale Albert Ier, Brussels.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">163</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">The difference between the Burgundian chronicles in New York and Berlin is most clear in the frontispiece. In the frontispiece of M. 536, history and current events are separated; Charles VI takes his place in the fourth frame, and the Trojan story fills the other three frames. Images in Phillipps 1917 do not preserve this distinction of eras. Rather the fifteenth-century emblems and devices introduced in three of the four frames overtly merge different historical periods and refer explicitly to other members of the royal family. The designer is thus able to gloss history without changing the text.</p><p class="normal">Only one of the scenes in the frontispiece to the Phillipps manuscript is set totally in the early fifteenth century. In the fourth frame of the frontispiece (Fig. 102), the counsellor who stands next to Charles VI is John the Fearless, Charles VI's cousin, who became duke of Burgundy in 1404. John carries a hammer comparable to those he holds in other portraits dating from the first two decades of the fifteenth century.<sup class="ref">[14]</sup> At the same time, details in the Trojan story portrayed in the other frames gloss John's political opponent negatively. In the first frame of the same frontispiece (Fig. 110) Paris's gold collar of mail equates him with Louis of Orléans, Charles VI's brother and John's political rival who was assassinated in 1409. This is a simplified version of the collar of the Order of the Porcupine, which appears in greater detail in a portrait of Louis (Fig. 111) from Christine de Pizan's collected works in London, a contemporary manuscript painted by the same artists.<sup class="ref">[15]</sup> The Order of the Porcupine, sometimes called the Order of the Mail, was founded in 1393 by Louis of Orléans, who often wore the collar with or without its dangling porcupine. Thus Louis of Orléans is identified with Paris, whose passion for Helen of Troy started the Trojan war.</p><p class="normal">Additional details in the frontispiece may reinforce this negative interpretation. The second frame (Fig. 112) portrays the Greek king Menelaeus who, like John the Fearless, does not appear in M. 536 (Plate 7). Even though his presence is justified by the text of the chronicle, Menelaeus evokes the French king because he wears a blue robe decorated with gold—the heraldic colors, if not the precise emblems, of France. These details of costume added to the pair of miniatures in the upper register provide an extratextual commentary suggesting that, just as Paris stole Helen from King Menelaeus, Louis of Orléans stole Isabeau from Charles VI. If such a reading of the frontispiece was intended, this could be one of the first images to refer to the rumor widely disseminated in Burgundian literature of the 1420S that Louis of Orléans and his sister-in-law, Isabeau of Bavaria, had an illicit relationship.<sup class="ref">[16]</sup></p><p class="normal">The differences between the New York and Berlin frontispieces demonstrate the flexibility of the Master of the <i>Cité des Dames's</i> mode of glossing. By adding a few details, he could transform a politically neutral image like the frontispiece to M. 536 into a polemical one. Other emblematic elaborations in Phillipps 1917 reinforce the role of the duke of Burgundy as an especially trusted assistant to King Charles VI. For instance, in the image of the coronation of Charlemagne as emperor (Fig. 105), both the pope and a spectator wear emblems that were popular in the early fifteenth century. The pope's robe is sprinkled with blazing suns that evoke the arms of Pope Alexander V (1409–10), who was supported by the French and elected to end the schism; the most prominent spectator to the left wears a robe covered with schematic planes, emblems of John the Fearless.<sup class="ref">[17]</sup> No complex message is hidden in this scene; rather, the reference to Alexander V situates the</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">164</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00109.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 110<br /> Abduction of Helen. <i> Grandes Chroniques de<br /> France</i> . Berlin, Deutsche Staatsbibliothek, Phill. 1917,<br /> fol. 1. Photograph: Deutsche Staatsbibliothek Berlin.</p><p class="normal"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00110.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 111<br /> Christine presents her book to Louis of<br /> Orléans. Christine de Pizan, <i> L'Épistre<br /> Othéa</i> . British Library, Harley 4431, fol.<br /> 95. By permission of the British Library.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">165</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00111.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 112<br /> Punishment of Troy. <i> Grandes Chroniques de<br /> France</i> . Berlin, Deutsche Staatsbibliothek, Phill. 1917,<br /> fol. 1. Photograph: Deutsche Staatsbibliothek Berlin.</p><p class="normal">pictorial gloss in the present, after 1409 when Alexander took office, and the portrayal of John the Fearless assisting at Charlemagne's coronation reiterates the message of the frontispiece—John's loyalty to Charlemagne's namesake, Charles VI.<sup class="ref">[18]</sup></p><p class="normal">Phillipps 1917 shares with M. 536 the innovative representation of coronations in which the dukes take an active role. Their basic pictorial vocabulary can be seen, for instance, in representations of the coronation of Charles V and Jeanne of Bourbon (Figs. 107 and 113). Dukes wearing circlets of gold are prominent in each image, and the message—that the dukes contribute significantly to making a king—is clear, particularly when this type of coronation is compared to the Master of the <i>Cité des Dames'</i> s stock scene (Fig. 108).</p><p class="normal">Although the form and content of individual coronation pictures may be identical in M. 536 and Phillipps 1917, their function in the program of miniatures is not. The Morgan Library's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> uses such scenes sparingly. The first royal coronation, at the life of Louis VIII, appears within the framework of the <i>reditus</i> , and subsequent scenes of royal coronation (at the lives of Philip V, Charles V, and Charles VI) were doubtless intended to recall that dynastic structure by echoing its compositional type. Coronations in Phillipps 1917 are not so tightly woven into a dynastic framework; rather they are unified by the concept of the Christian kingship of France.</p><p class="normal">This theme, which found broad popularity in the fifteenth century through the <i>religion royale</i> , is initiated by the first coronation scene in this manuscript, the coronation of Clovis (Fig. 114). Most of the following coronation sequences assume this form, but the coronations of Saint Louis (Fig. 115) and Louis IV (Fig. 116) are more complex compositions.

Louis's sainthood confirmed the Christian kingship of France that Clovis had initiated, and, as we have seen, Capetian and Valois kings descended from Louis were quick to promote his sanctity.</p><p class="normal">Louis IV's coronation is the second to represent barons in distinctive costumes. This picture does not celebrate Christian kingship so much as the role of the barons in ensuring continuity. It commemorates the return of the legitimate king to the throne by the barons of France, who brought the young Louis IV back to France after his mother had fled with him to England. Like the distinctive coronation type that occurs throughout M. 536 and Phillipps 1917, this image concentrates on the support of the barons for the monarchy and their action on its behalf. It is tempting to see this image as a reference to a contemporary event in French history. In 1405 John the Fearless and his supporters brought the dauphin back to Paris when his mother, Isabeau of Bavaria, and his uncle, Louis of Orléans, sought to remove him from the capital and free him from Burgundian control.</p><p class="normal">The frontispiece, the illustration of Charlemagne's coronation, and the generalized representations of coronation demonstrate how pictures in this specific chronicle work as contemporary glosses to establish independent parallels between French history and events from the time of Charles VI. The pro-Burgundian, anti-Orléanist message of this manuscript is cumulative, as in M. 536, but it operates on a simpler level. The pictures and text of M. 536 are so closely interwoven that the message of its pictorial program depends upon a consideration of all its parts. In Phillipps 1917, however, the accumulation of information from a sequence of images may refine the political message, but each individual image contains enough information to convey its message independently.</p><p class="normal">What is most striking about these two copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> is that, no matter how the message is conveyed, the underlying call for ducal or baronial responsibility is pervasive. This emphasis on noble support for the king had more parallels in contemporary royalist political writings than in pictorial cycles illustrating previous <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .</p><p class="normal">Such authors as Christine de Pizan and Jean Gerson realized the dukes' powers and exhorted them to work for the good of the monarchy. Christine dedicated her works first to Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy; then to Louis, duke of Orléans; and finally to John, duke of Berry, reflecting her changing opinions about who would be best equipped to govern the realm as custodian for the young dauphin during Charles VI's madness. In times of crisis, Christine and Gerson directly addressed the dukes to encourage them to place the French realm above their own ambitions. After the aborted kidnapping of the dauphin Louis by Louis of Orléans in 1405, Christine's <i>Lettre à la reine</i> and Gerson's sermon, <i>Vivat rex</i> , called for peace and emphasized the importance and the responsibilities of the king and his counsellors, a theme to which Gerson returned again in the sermon, <i>Veniat pax</i> of 1408, and which Christine addressed in <i>Lamentacion sur les maux de la guerre civile</i> in 1410.<sup class="ref">[19]</sup> These texts, like the pictures in the Morgan Library's <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , expressed the hope current in the first decades of the fifteenth century that the dukes of France would responsibly safeguard the French monarchy rather than expand their own power.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">169</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">The insistent presence of the dukes in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> also mirrors political reality. When these manuscripts were painted, the princes of the blood were actively involved in the government of France, and Burgundian power seemed to be at its strongest. By the end of December 1409, John the Fearless had become sole guardian of Louis of Guyenne and was thus in a position to influence the dauphin, the virtual ruler of France, during Charles VI's attacks.<sup class="ref">[20]</sup> John shared the regency briefly with the duke of Berry in 1410, but by the end of the civil war in 1412, John the Fearless was in a strong position in the government and at the height of his power.</p><h3 class="Heading-Heading3">The Role of the Queen and the Dauphin</h3><p class="noindent">Equally concerned with contemporary problems, other manuscripts of the chronicle painted by the Master of the <i>Cité des Dames</i> focus on the queen and the dauphin rather than the dukes. The pictures in a <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> now in Paris (Mazarine 2028), which predates the assassination of Louis of Orléans in 1407, provide nonpartisan commentary on the conflict between Louis of Orléans and John the Fearless and the importance of Queen Isabeau of Bavaria's role in politics. A second chronicle, in Brussels (B.R. Ms. 3), dates from the second decade of the fifteenth century when the dauphin, Louis of Guyenne, approached his maturity; some of its images refer to the importance of his education. Together these books address additional issues of concern to the court and to Parisian intellectual circles in the first part of the fifteenth century. Like the chronicles in Berlin and New York, they could be termed royalist books. They support those who sought to preserve the French monarchy but concentrate on different agents of preservation.</p><p class="normal">An imposing frontispiece and three rare subjects gloss French history with contemporary commentary in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> from the Bibliothèque Mazarine. As in Phillipps 1917, pictures in this chronicle include arms and devices that identify figures from French history with contemporary personages. They celebrate the French dynasty and comment on the civil war in France.</p><p class="normal">The Trojan frontispiece (Fig. 100) embodies a dynastic theme. Within this miniature, two boats fleeing the burning city of Troy display the arms of France and Brittany. This juxtaposition is perplexing at first, because the text of the chapter describes the refugees from Troy but does not mention the Bretons. Instead, the chronicle notes three major countries founded by Trojan refugees: Italy, founded by Aeneas; Britain, by Brut; and France, by Francion.</p><p class="normal">This use of Breton arms becomes clear when we consider the source for the description of Brut's life in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> , Geoffrey of Monmouth's <i>History of the Kings of Britain</i> .<sup class="ref">[21]</sup> Geoffrey's text stresses the interrelated histories of Britain and Brittany, which was colonized by the descendants of Brut. When Britain was in difficulty, the Bretons sent armies to aid their island relatives. War, pestilence, and famine, however, eventually defeated the Britons, who emigrated as a nation to Brittany. Thus, as Geoffrey of Monmouth describes it, "From that time, the power of the Britons ceased in the island, and the Angles began their reign."<sup class="ref">[22]</sup> Although the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> never refers explicitly to the history of Brittany, it does echo Geoffrey: "From this Brut descended all the kings who were in the land [Britain] up until the time when the English, who came from one of</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">170</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00116.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 117<br /> Queen Clotilda divides the realm among her sons. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Mazarine, Ms. 2028, fol. 14. Photograph by the author.</p><p class="normal">the countries of Saxony called Angle, took the land for which [reason] it is called England."<sup class="ref">[23]</sup> We could say, then, that the Trojan refugees in this miniature bear Breton arms because the Bretons, rather than their English supplanters, were of Trojan descent.</p><p class="normal">Contemporary history provides another motive for the use of Breton arms. In 1396, Jeanne of France, third daughter of Charles VI and Isabeau of Bavaria, married John of Montfort, heir to the duchy of Brittany.<sup class="ref">[24]</sup> The alliance of these two houses was politically motivated. Notoriously independent, Breton dukes placed the security of their duchy before their duties as vassals of the French king. By securing a marriage tie with the Breton house, the French sought to strengthen relations between the Bretons and the French. The heraldic display in the frontispiece thus implies that the recent connection of the two houses has its roots in their shared Trojan ancestry.</p><p class="normal">Other pictures in the chronicle refer to internal French politics. For example, the illustration to the second book (Fig. 117) shows Queen Clotilda dividing the realm among her four sons, pictured as kings. Two of these kings have special attributes: the king at the far right clasps a stick, and the king at the far left holds a schematized hammer. These are generalized references to the political emblems of Charles VI's brother and cousin—the <i> bâton noueux</i> or knotty stick of Louis,</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">171</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00117.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 118<br /> Queen Clotilda divides the realm among her sons. <i> Grandes<br /> Chroniques de France</i> . Berlin, Deutsche Staatsbibliothek,<br /> Phill. 1917, fol. 14. Photograph: Deutsche Staatsbibliothek Berlin.</p><p class="normal">duke of Orléans, and the hammer of John the Fearless, duke of Burgundy.<sup class="ref">[25]</sup> The history of Queen Clotilda's sons clarifies the references to these noble cousins.<sup class="ref">[26]</sup> After Clotilda partitioned the realm, two of her sons formed a greedy alliance to battle one of their brothers. Only Queen Clotilda's active intervention prevented fratricide. The use of Burgundian and Orléanist emblems in a scene of Clotilda and her sons may therefore comment on the deadly rivalry between these blood relations of Charles VI.</p><p class="normal">The timeliness of this image is confirmed by representations in the two later manuscripts of the Master of the <i>Cité des Dames</i> , neither of which includes the simplified hammer. In the pro-Burgundian manuscript, Phillipps 1917, for example (Fig. 118), Clotilda's son at the far left is the only one to retain his emblem. Without the opposing hammer, the baton loses its overlay of political meaning and serves as a neutral sign of office.<sup class="ref">[27]</sup></p><p class="normal">The inclusion of Clotilda with her sons may also address a second theme that permeated royalist, as opposed to Burgundian or Orléanist, political writings of the early fifteenth century—the importance of the queen in governing the realm. Certainly the theme of queenly power is expressed in two other pictures from the Paris manuscript: the coronation of Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious, as King of Aquitaine (Fig. 119) and the discussion of the royal succession after the death</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">172</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00118.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 119<br /> Coronation of Louis the Pious as king of Aquitaine.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque<br /> Mazarine, Ms. 2028, fol. 131. Photograph by the author.</p><p class="normal">of the last Capetian king (Fig. 120). Never before had queens been included in these scenes. The second in particular shows the queen, an expectant mother, as an important protagonist in discussions about the future government of France. Probably because of the short lives of French dauphins (three had died by 1397), the image recalls an important theme in contemporary politics and literature—Queen Isabeau of Bavaria's role in the government of France and the hope that she would interfere to regulate the chaos caused by the rivalry of the dukes.</p><p class="normal">The major source of Isabeau's power was her role as one of the regents charged with the <i>tutelle</i> , or education, of the dauphin in case the king should die or be absent from the realm.<sup class="ref">[28]</sup> Charles V had been the first king since Saint Louis to give such a prominent role to the queen. His laws were adopted by Charles VI and his council in 1393—right after Charles's first attack of insanity—and remained in effect until 1407.<sup class="ref">[29]</sup> Under their provisions, Louis of Orléans became regent if the king died or was "absent," and Isabeau of Bavaria and the dukes of Burgundy and Berry were charged with the education of the prince. As royalist writers like Christine de Pizan recognized, Isabeau's role as guardian of the dauphin and peacemaker in a regency government became especially important once the dukes of Burgundy and Orléans became openly hostile in 1405.<sup class="ref">[30]</sup></p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">173</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00119.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 120<br /> Discussion of the royal succession. <i> Grandes Chroniques de France</i> .<br /> Bibliothèque Mazarine, Ms. 2028, fol. 354v. Photograph by the author.</p><p class="normal">The close relationship between royalist sentiment and pictorial imagery in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in Paris continues in later chronicles by artists from the <i>Cité des Dames</i> workshop. The <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in Brussels (B.R. 3) dates from the second decade of the fifteenth century when Charles VI's heir, Louis of Guyenne, was in his early teens. Perhaps as a result of the dauphin's maturity, distinctive miniatures in this book focus exclusively on the importance of the education of dauphins.</p><p class="normal">Three pictures in this book show the interaction of a king and his son. One shows King John the Good, Charles VI's grandfather, investing his young son, Charles, with the Dauphiné (Fig. 121). Two others offer examples of good and bad kingship that were especially appropriate to a dauphin named Louis. The miniature beginning Louis the Stammerer's life (Fig. 122) shows Louis compromising himself to gain power; he gives the barons anything they want in order to win their favor. In the process, Louis grasps his son's wrist to compel him to participate. A complementary image from another section of the chronicle shows the prince's willing compliance when his father is a positive influence. In this picture from the beginning of the life of Saint Louis (Fig. 123), the young Louis sits next to his father, Louis VIII, and helps supervise the burning of heretics.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">174</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00120.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 121<br /> John the Good invests Charles with the Dauphiné.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Royale,<br /> Ms. 3, fol. 373.<br /> Copyright Bibliothèque Royale Albert Ier, Brussels.</p><p class="normal">Neither miniature faithfully reflects the chronicle's text.<sup class="ref">[31]</sup> Louis the Stammerer had two sons—Louis and Carloman—neither of whom was mentioned in the chapter that this picture illustrates.

This sort of elaboration ranges from the inclusion of characters described in the text but rarely visualized (as in Jeanne of Evreux's presence at the discussion of the royal succession in Mazarine 2028), to the addition of historical characters who contradict their text (Saint Louis happily burning heretics in B.R. 3), to the insertion of anachronistic emblems and devices into stock scenes (as in the Burgundian hammer and the Orléanist Order of the Porcupine in the frontispiece</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">176</span> ―</div><p class="noindent"><div class="illgrp"><img src="https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/jd/ft8k4008jd/figures/ft8k4008jd_00122.jpg" alt="figure" /></div></p><p class="caption">Figure 123<br /> Louis VIII and his son Louis supervise the burning of heretics.<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> . Bibliothèque Royale, Ms. 3,<br /> fol. 248. Copyright Bibliothèque Royale Albert Ier, Brussels.</p><p class="normal">of Phillipps 1917). In these glosses, immediately perceptible to a careful reader of one chapter or the whole manuscript, the overarching message of the program of decoration conveys the same message as each individual part.</p><p class="normal">The Master of the <i>Cité des Dames'</i> s more complicated method of glossing encompasses the whole program of decoration. In this system, most commonly seen in kings' books, individual pictures carry only a portion of the message. Images work in sequences, building a message through repeated compositions (as in the series of coronations in M. 536) or through visual cross-referencing (as in the pair of <i>exempla</i> for the education of the dauphin in B.R. 3). The message of the whole is much more than a sum of its parts—and often is very subtle, perhaps explaining why this kind of cycle occurs most frequently in manuscripts like that in New York where the text has been edited to promote a partisan view.</p><p class="normal">These manuscripts provide important evidence for a changing view of history in the fifteenth century. In the late fourteenth and the early fifteenth century the princes of the blood emerged simultaneously as major participants in government and as important patrons of the arts,<sup class="ref">[33]</sup> and during the reign of Charles VI the blood relations of the king began to assume a special status—to share, in a sense, some of the holiness of the French king, as they shared some of the responsibilities</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">177</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">of government. At this time, therefore, the decorative programs in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> worked to extend to the king's blood relations the prologue's directive that the king should seek models in its pages. The conviction, held by the princes of the blood and the court, that the blood relations of the king also had a mandate to govern inspired the creation of such advice books as the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> decorated by the Master of the <i> Cité des Dames</i> .</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">179</span> ―</div><h2 class="Heading-Heading2">EPILOGUE—<br /> THE <i>GRANDES CHRONIQUES</i> IN THE LATE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</h2><p class="noindent">The fortunes of France took a turn for the worse after about 1415.<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> Just as it became evident that Charles VI's mental illness would no longer permit him to take an active role in government, the dauphin, Louis of Guyenne, died. The next dauphin, John of Touraine, was returning to Paris in 1417 when he became ill and also died. Armagnacs who controlled the capital and the government of Charles VI named the new dauphin, Charles (later Charles VII), lieutenant general of the king. At the same time Queen Isabeau, who had fled Paris in 1417, established a provisional government at Troyes and appointed Duke John the Fearless of Burgundy governor general of the realm. Both Armagnacs and Burgundians sought to guarantee their legitimacy by gaining control of King Charles VI and the city of Paris. In 1418 when the Burgundians staged a successful coup, the dauphin Charles fled to Bourges and established a government-in-exile there.</p><p class="normal">Despite the assassination of John the Fearless in 1419, Burgundian forces were sufficiently powerful to retain control of the capital and negotiate the Treaty of Troyes with the English in 1420. This treaty ostensibly ended the Hundred Years' War, because it provided that Henry V of England would drop his claim to French territories during Charles VI's lifetime if Charles would designate Henry and his heirs as successors to the kingdom of France. Shortly after the signing of the treaty, the dauphin Charles was summoned to a <i>lit-de-justice</i> , a judicial session of Parlement, investigating his role in the murder of John the Fearless. When the dauphin did not appear, he was formally disinherited and banished.</p><p class="normal">Henry V became king of France after Charles VI died in 1422, but Henry died shortly thereafter, and his infant son, Henry VI, succeeded to the dual monarchy. France was governed on his behalf by a regent, the duke of Bedford, who resided in Paris. Because the dauphin Charles also claimed the throne from his court in the Loire valley, civil war resumed. Charles VII was crowned king in Reims in 1429 with the help of Joan of Arc, and by 1437 he and his successful forces entered Paris. By 1453 Charles VII's army had reconquered France.</p><p class="normal">The lack of a French royal presence in the capital from about 1420 to 1440 helps explain the dearth of illustrated manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> after the first quarter of the fifteenth century. Because the chronicle had been popular among a Parisian audience intimately associated with the Capetian and Valois kings of France, there was little place for the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> as an expression of French national pride once the English took control of the government in Paris.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">180</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">The English rulers did not patronize illustrated copies of the chronicle, preferring dynastic imagery that centered on Saint Louis, an ancestor that Henry V and Henry VI shared with the French. The duke of Bedford and members of his Anglo-French chancery promoted dynastic ideas in coinage, in posters hung in the city of Paris, and in public ceremonial.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup></p><p class="normal">The <i>religion royale</i> was renewed in Paris only after the restoration of the Valois to the throne in the mid–fifteenth century, and it was strongest during the reigns of Louis XI and Charles VIII, the last Valois kings.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup> Although the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> was revived at the late fifteenth-century French court, it had lost its position as the preeminent royal history, probably because its content was out of date. The account recorded in the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> ended early in Charles VI's reign; it was superseded by a Latin chronicle and a complete life of Charles VI written by Michel Pintoin, the <i>religieux</i> of Saint-Denis, and Pintoin's chronicle was continued with a Latin life of Charles VII written by Jean Chartier.<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> The lives of Charles VI and VII were translated into French; Juvenal des Ursins translated Charles VI's life in the early 1430s, and Jean Chartier revised and updated his Latin life of Charles VII in a French translation. These translations were paired most frequently with Pintoin's Latin chronicle rather than with the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .</p><p class="normal">Two groups of <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> exemplify the different functions of the chronicle in Parisian circles after the mid–fifteenth century. The first group consists of unillustrated texts on paper or on mixtures of parchment and paper that belonged (when provenance is known) to secretaries and notaries and to members of the Parlement.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup> These inexpensive books filled a practical need; they provided a chronology for persons charged with maintaining the state archives and doubtless also assisted them in their increasingly common role as writers of history.</p><p class="normal">A second illustrated group of <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> reflects the Parisian nobility's increased interest in the expression of dynastic issues in public ceremonial. The most famous of these is the copy of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> completed in the mid–fifteenth century by Jean Fouquet for Charles VII (B.N. fr. 6465), a chronicle illustrating such ceremonies as <i> sacres</i> , entries, and funerals that paid special attention to the pomp surrounding the visit of the Holy Roman Emperor to Charles V in 1378.<sup class="ref">[6]</sup> Two other manuscripts in Paris (B.N. fr. 5729 and Arsenal 5128) with identical layouts document the continuing interest in this ceremonial genre during the last quarter of the fifteenth century. Their text consists of an excerpt from the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> describing the visit of the Holy Roman Emperor to Charles V in Paris in 1378 and is decorated by a miniature of the meeting of Charles V and Charles IV outside Paris. The concentration on Charles V in this pair of abridged texts may have royal and imperial connotations; these books glorify Charles V, the last direct royal ancestor of Louis XII, who was king when they were produced.<sup class="ref">[7]</sup> The interest manifested in the visit of the Holy Roman Emperor may also relate to the imperial aspirations of the French monarchs in the late fifteenth century.<sup class="ref">[8]</sup></p><p class="normal">In this late period illustrated Parisian copies of the <i> Grandes Chroniques</i> most commonly commemorated ceremonies that provided precedents for the public celebrations increasingly popular under the last Valois kings. In this respect, these manuscripts relate more closely to contemporary books like those that memorialized the <i>tableaux</i> from royal entries than to earlier copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[9]</sup></p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">181</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">Courts outside of Paris seem to have been the primary audience for illustrated manuscripts of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in the second half of the fifteenth century. Guillaume Fillastre commissioned a <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> (Leningrad, Public Library, Saltykov-Schedrin Er. fr. 88) decorated by Simon Marmion, for presentation in the 1450s to Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. A manuscript dated 1471 now in Paris (B.N. fr. 2609), is attributed to Robinet Testard and was probably executed in the Loire valley near Poitiers where Testard was active. Even Thomas Thwaytes, the English king Henry VII's "tresorier de ses ville et marches de Calays," commissioned a multivolume manuscript (B.L. Royal 20 E I–20 E VI) produced in Calais in 1487 as a gift for the English monarch.<sup class="ref">[10]</sup> These non-Parisian manuscripts contain updated texts and extensive narrative cycles that illustrate French history without the stress on ceremonial evident in many contemporary Parisian copies of the chronicle. They seem to have met a new regional taste for dynastic and courtly literature that is especially well-documented for the Burgundian court.<sup class="ref">[11]</sup></p><p class="padded">By the late fifteenth century, the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> seems to have been considered one history among many—and it was not the most important. Although Vérard printed specially illuminated royal versions of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> on vellum, French kings of the late fifteenth century were interested in more modern histories.<sup class="ref">[12]</sup> Thus Louis XI carried with him in his travels the mid-fifteenth-century <i>Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i> by Noël de Fribois rather than the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .<sup class="ref">[13]</sup> Although the royal myths described in the chronicle continued to be popular into the sixteenth century, other, more contemporary, histories incorporated them and these, rather than the <i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> , shaped the royal image.</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">183</span> ―</div><h2 class="normal">Notes</h2><h3 class="normal">PREFACE</h3><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
1. The impetus for the translation of the Latin histories probably came during the reign of Saint Louis, because the translation of the text was completed in the 1270s and the Latin <i>
recueil</i>
, one source for it, was completed in the first half of the thirteenth century. Further, a reference in the prologue that the translator undertook the work "at the command of a man whom he neither could nor should refuse" . . . (enprist il ceste ouvre à fere par le commandement de tel home que il ne pout ne ne dut refuser) has led some to postulate the direct patronage of Saint Louis. For this, see Gabrielle Spiegel, <i>

In a section of his book devoted to "aids to readers," Guenée attempts to describe in general terms the role of pictures in manuscripts. Although his discussion remains broad, he is one of the few historians to suggest that illustrations of historical accounts may contribute to an understanding of their text. See Guenée, <i>
Histoire et culture historique</i>
, 237-41.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
8. In contrast, most other vernacular histories seem to have been illustrated with limited pictorial cycles. Thus the earliest surviving manuscript of the chronicle of the Anonymous of Chantilly (Vat. Reg. 624) is unillustrated; only the late fifteenth-century version (Musée Condé, Ms. 869) has a pictorial cycle. Further, although the Johannes translation of the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle was illustrated from the mid-thirteenth century with one to three historiated initials, the most densely illuminated copies of the text are a pair dating from the early fourteenth and mid-fifteenth centuries and illustrated by 15 miniatures. See Ronald Walpole, ed., <i>
The Old French Johannes Translation of the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle: A Critical Edition</i>
 (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1976); and Rita Lejeune and Jacques Stiennon, <i>
La légende de Roland dans l'art du Moyen-Âge</i>
 (Brussels, 1969), 1:270-75, 2: plates 265-79, XXXVII. The only complete surviving manuscript (B.N. n. a. fr. 6295) of the Anonymous of Béthune is a late thirteenth-century book illustrated by a series of historiated initials.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
9. Although Paulin Paris, Jules Viard, and Roland Delachenal note variants in their editions of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, they give priority to royal copies of the manuscript. Viard and Delachenal use as their base manuscripts the first <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 (Ste.-Gen. 782) for text through the life of Saint Louis and Charles V's book (B.N. fr. 2813) for the life of Louis VIII and for the lives of Philip III to the beginning of Charles VI. Because Charles V's manuscript ends abruptly in 1379, the edition was completed by a transcription from B.N. fr. 17270.</p><p class="indent">
Their selection of texts presents a somewhat lopsided view of what constitutes a typical copy of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
. For instance, priority is given to the translation of Louis IX's life added in the fourteenth century to the first <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 (Ste.-Gen. 782) although an earlier translation of Guillaume de Nangis's <i>
Gesta Ludovici IX</i>
 existed in John the Good's manuscript (B.L. Royal 16 G VI), and a different translation taken from Guillaume de Nangis's amplified chronicle (of c. 1316-18) appears in a series of manuscripts made by Parisian <i>
libraires</i>
 (B.N. fr. 10132; Castres, B.M.; Grenoble, 407 Rés.). Of these earlier translations, the version in John's manuscript is published in an appendix to Viard's edition in which footnotes describe different readings from B.N. fr. 10132. In addition, the life of Charles V recorded in Delachenal's edition corresponds to that in Charles V's manuscript (B.N. fr. 2813), which differs significantly from that in virtually every other manuscript containing the text (here Delachenal gives variant readings in his footnotes).

3. See Jordan, <i>
Louis IX</i>

For Jordan, Louis's subsequent actions—his subjugation of the barons, his active role in bringing peace to the Christian West, and his public manifestations of royal charity and devotion—were motivated by a desire to become worthy to succeed in his next crusade. For further discussion and for support of the theory that Louis's actions were intended to demonstrate that the Capetians were legitimate kings because they merited kingship, see Robert J.

18. On Primat's originality, see Guenée, "<i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>

Grandes Chroniques</i>
. Although studies have suggested that Primat drew from epics and earlier vernacular histories, no one has yet undertaken a systematic analysis of Primat's reliance on them. Mandach cites a few examples to show that Primat consulted epics, and Pierre Botineau has shown that Primat used the vernacular chronicle of the Anonymous of Chantilly as a reference when he had difficulty translating his Latin sources.

 of the Anonymous of Béthune in one complete manuscript, and the <i>

19. For an interpretation of the vernacular translations of the <i>
Pseudo-Turpin</i>
 chronicle as partisan texts that originated in northern France and Flanders among a group of nobles opposed to Philip Augustus's centralizing policies, see Spiegel, "<i>
Pseudo-Turpin</i>
." She examines the motives for sponsoring translations as professed in the prologues of the six independent versions of the French Pseudo-Turpin chronicle and analyzes these motives in relation to the historical circumstances faced by the patrons of the translations in early thirteenth-century France and Flanders. Although the origins of the translations seem to be political on at least one level, the popularity of the French Pseudo-Turpin chronicle may have persisted because of the popularity of legends of Charlemagne.

20. As early as the first quarter of the thirteenth century during the reign of Philip Augustus, the monks of Saint-Denis compiled a Latin volume that assembled texts tracing French history from the fall of Troy through the life of Louis VI. This volume (Vat. Reg. lat. 550) later served as a model for a second compilation (B.N. lat. 5925) made during Louis

IX's reign. B.N. lat. 5925 included the life of Philip Augustus as well and was probably the Latin basis for the translation of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
. Both these books remained in the abbey's library at least until the fourteenth century. For discussion of these manuscripts, see Spiegel, <i>
Chronicle Tradition</i>

21. Little is known about Primat beyond the fact that he was a monk at Saint-Denis and a historian; he wrote at least one other history—a life of Saint Louis, which was continued through the life of Philip the Bold. For a summary of the literature on Primat, see Spiegel, <i>
Chronicle Tradition</i>
, 83-92.</p><p class="indent">
Although Primat's chronicle, the original draft of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, is of primary concern for the moment, it should be noted that the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 was continued through the reign of Philip of Valois (1328-50), with a life of Louis VIII and translations from the Latin chronicle and continuations of Guillaume de Nangis (for the era to 1340), and an original French text (for 1340 to 1350). In the 1370s authorship of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 definitely shifted from monastery to court, when Pierre d'Orgement probably wrote the account of the reigns of John the Good and Charles V. Shortly after Charles V's death in 1380, two chapters describing the accession of Charles VI were added. This is the most common terminus for the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, although at least two other manuscripts (M. 536 and B.R. 4) have texts that continue past the traditional stopping point to end in 1384. See Spiegel, <i>
Chronicle Tradition</i>
, 117-26, and Chapters 3, 5-7, and 10 of this book.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
22. Léopold Delisle, "Notes sur quelques manuscrits du Musée Britannique," <i>
Mémoires de la Société de l'histoire de Paris et de l'Ile-de-France</i>
 4 (1878): 206-7. This observation, and the fact that the earlier Dionysian compilation (Vat. Reg. lat. 550) did not contain the life of Philip Augustus that was in B.N. lat. 5925 and translated in Primat's <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, makes it likely that Primat used B.N. lat. 5925 rather than Vat. Reg. lat. 550, the earlier Dionysian anthology, as a source for the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
23. For a discussion of the ways in which Johannes, one of the earliest translators of the Pseudo-Turpin chronicle, modified his Latin source, see Walpole, who contends that Johannes "made the structure more orderly and clear, the style more natural and convincing." Walpole, ed., <i>
Old French Pseudo-Turpin</i>
, 1:xvi.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
24. A few texts translated in the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 were not included in the Latin compilation. One of these, the <i>
Descriptio qualiter</i>
, seems to have been copied from a manuscript of the same textual family as B.N. lat. 12710. See Viard, ed., <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, 3:xii-xiii, 155, 160-61, 197. For a discussion of the popularity of the <i>
Descriptio qualiter</i>
 and an analysis of a cycle of stained glass at Saint-Denis based upon the text, see Elizabeth A. R. Brown and Michael W. Cothren, "The Twelfth-Century Crusading Window of the Abbey of Saint-Denis: Praeteritorum Enim Recordatio Futurorum est Exhibitio," <i>
Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</i>
 49 (1986): 11-40. A second text not present in B.N. lat. 5925 was the life of Louis VII, a copy of which was intercalated into B.N. lat. 5925 in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century (after the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 was translated) by a second scribe who also continued the manuscript with the lives of Louis VIII, Saint Louis, and Philip III. See Delisle, "Notes sur quelques manuscrits," 206-10; and Spiegel, <i>
Chronicle Tradition</i>
, 68-71. Spiegel argues convincingly that this historical <i>
recueil</i>
 was not compiled as a draft for the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, but was simply a copy of texts including "the best of what was known to deal with French history." Schneidmüller's demonstration that B.N. lat. 5925 depends on Vat. Reg. 550, a historical compendium from the first portion of the thirteenth century, supports her conclusion. See Schneidmüller's "Ein Geschichtskompendium."

14. No documents concerning this commission survive. Wright believes that Matthew of Vendôme was solely responsible for the tombs, whereas Erlande Brandenburg speculates, on the basis of passages describing the renovation of the choir and the translation of the royal ashes in Guillaume of Nangis's <i>
Life of Saint Louis</i>
, that Louis IX played an active role in the commission as well. Sources give conflicting dates for translation of the bodies and hence for the completion of the project. These range from 1263-64 in the <i>
Annales Sancti Dionisii</i>
 to 1267 in Guillaume of Nangis's text. For the program of tombs and the date of completion of the project, see Sommers, "Royal Tombs of Saint-Denis"; Wright, "Royal Tomb Program"; and Erlande-Brandenburg, <i>

18. The arrangement of tombs completed between 1264 and 1267 emphasized two points central to French political theory: first, that the Carolingian and Capetian races were founded by members of families that each had a tradition of governance in France, and second, that by virtue of their Carolingian blood, Louis VIII and Philip Augustus accomplished the <i>
Reditus regni Francorum ad stirpem Karoli Magni</i>
, the return of France to Carolingian rule, and thus were legitimate rulers, descendants of both the Carolingian and Capetian lines. The inclusion of Louis IX's tomb and subsequent rearrangement during the reign of Philip the Fair neglected these familial divisions and placed the tombs of Philip the Fair
continue</p><p class="indent">
and his parents on the Carolingian side of the choir, in close proximity to the tomb of Saint Louis. For this, see Gabrielle Spiegel, "The <i>

In its original form, the manuscript contained the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 through the life of Philip Augustus. Sometime in the early fourteenth century one folio (presumably blank) was excised following fol. 326, and the life of Louis IX was added. Still later, probably in the reign of Charles V, who signed the chronicle (fol. 374v), a map of the world with Jerusalem at its center was painted on fol. 374v at the end of the manuscript.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
21. Branner identified one of the artists who worked on the manuscript (Artist I in my Catalogue of Manuscripts) as an artist based in Paris, a member of the Main Line of the Sainte-Chapelle group. This group painted a number of religious books, ranging from an Evangeliary used in the Sainte-Chapelle and a Sequentiary for the king's <i>
capella</i>
, to Decretals and texts by Aristotle. For discussion of this style, see Robert Branner, <i>
Manuscript Painting in Paris during the Reign of Saint Louis: A Study of Styles</i>
 (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1977), 129, 236-37.</p><p class="indent">
For the argument that Philip III's copy of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 was made at the abbey of Saint-Denis, see Nebbiai-Dalla Guarda, <i>
La bibliothèque</i>
, 48-49, 310. I question the validity of Nebbiai-Dalla Guarda's attribution of Philip III's book to Saint-Denis because of the location of the artist's workshops in Paris. It seems much more likely that Matthew of Vendôme would have had the presentation manuscript made by the best scribes and artists who worked for the court, as Giles of Pontoise did later for the <i>
Vita et Passio</i>
 of Ivo of Saint-Denis. For the presentation manuscript, see Lacaze, <i>

This French poem and its accompaniment (a second Latin poem) are preserved in a very small group of manuscripts: B.L., Add. 38128, an unillustrated manuscript written sometime after the death of Philip III in 1385 (poems at the end of the life of Philip Augustus—and the end of the manuscript); Cambrai, B.M. 682, an illustrated manuscript dating from the early fourteenth century (poems between the lives of Louis VII and Philip Augustus); Switzerland, Private Collection, an illustrated manuscript of c. 1330 (poems between the lives of Louis VII and Philip Augustus); and B.N. fr. 2813, Charles V's luxurious manuscript, written and painted in the 1360s and 1370s (poems between the lives of Philip Augustus and Louis VIII).

In Ste.-Gen. 782 these poems are written on the verso of fol. 326, the last leaf of text in the book as it existed in the late thirteenth century, by a different scribe from the one who did the rest of the gathering.

33. Genet argues for a more restricted definition of Mirrors of Princes and for consideration of the political contexts that generated them. His preliminary findings suggest that
continue</p><p class="indent">
the court of Henry II in England was the first to have a "renaissance" of political literature, but the French Mirrors of Princes seemed closely linked to Saint Louis. Most were written in Latin in the second half of the thirteenth century by mendicants who moved in the circle of scholars close to Louis IX. Though Genet's definition of a Mirror of Princes is narrow, his observations demonstrate at the very least that this class of text was quite popular in France during the latter half of the thirteenth century.

42. For this interpretation of Philip Augustus's devotion to Charlemagne, see Spiegel, "<i>
Reditus</i>
," 164-71. Spiegel examines the function of the cult of Charlemagne at the court of Philip Augustus. She notes its intrusion into an official register where, she suggests, the juxtaposition of the Sibylline and Valerian prophecies with an account of Philip's conquest of Bouvines was intended to legitimate Philip's conquests. Spiegel sees the presence of these texts in a royal register as a sign that "the cult of Charlemagne has passed from the level of poetry to that of politics." For further discussion of this register, see Baldwin, <i>

The Latin text of Guillaume de Nangis's <i>
Abbreviated Chronicle</i>
, written sometime between 1286 and 1294, includes short descriptions of the kings of France, starting with Priam and tracing their descent to Philip IV. The earliest surviving copy (B.N. lat. 6184) has in its margins a sketchy genealogical tree designed to guide the reader through the often multicolumned text by concentrating on the royal line and on important events and people. As in the program of tombs, the Latin chronicle presents the Carolingians and Merovingians as a continuous line, because Pepin was descended from Blitildis, a legendary daughter of the Merovingian king, Clotaire II (fol. 8). The <i>
Abbreviated Chronicle</i>
 also, like the tombs, presents Hugh Capet's line as separate and promotes the <i>
reditus</i>
 as a means of returning the Capetians to the "progeny of Charlemagne" (fols. 11-12). It resembles the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 in introducing the <i>
reditus</i>
 at the beginning of Hugh Capet's life.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

4. In suggesting that the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 in Cambrai was a royal recension, I do not mean to imply that it was based upon Philip III's copy, which was preserved in the royal library, because at least one other contemporary draft of the chronicle containing the poems survives in London (B.L. Add. 38128). An addition to the genealogy in ch. 16 of the first book of the life of Philip Augustus (fol. 270) of that unillustrated manuscript refers to the death of Philip III in 1285 but not to that of Philip IV in 1315.</p><p class="indent">
The textual filiation between Ste.-Gen. 782; Cambrai, B.M. 682; and B.L. Add. 38128 has not been fully explored, but there is evidence that none of the three is totally dependent on either of the others. For example, Cambrai, B.M. 682 includes the Latin and French poems that appear in Ste.-Gen. 782 but places them in a different position in the text (fols. 289-290, before the life of Philip Augustus) from that of either B.L. Add. 38128 (fol. 308) or Ste.-Gen. 782 (fol. 326v), where the poems appear at the end of Philip Augustus's life. But B.L. Add. 38128 and Ste.-Gen. 782 are not identical either, because B.L. Add. 38128 and Cambrai, B.M. 682 include interpolated rubrics that were not present in Ste.-Gen. 782. Apparently these rubrics were a late thirteenth-century addition to the text of the chronicle; a later hand added them to the margins of Ste.-Gen. 782 when it served as a textual model for Charles V's <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
. For this, see Chapter 5 of this book.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

17. The <i>

version was split into two (B.N. fr. 2090-2092 and B.N. lat. 13836), and a second remained whole (perhaps B.N. lat. 5286). Both were cited by the monks of Saint-Denis in 1410 in the trial over the relic of Denis's head, which has led Delaborde to suggest that B.N. lat. 13836 was from the royal library and B.N. lat. 5286 from the abbey library. See Henri-François Delaborde, "Le procès du chef de Saint Denis en 1410," <i>
Mémoires de la Société de l'histoire de Paris et de l'Ile-de-France</i>
 11 (1884): 352-53.</p><p class="indent">
Lacaze believes that B.N. lat. 5286 was a draft for the king's presentation manuscript. Bähr's position is diametrically opposed to that of Lacaze, suggesting that B.N. lat. 5286 postdates 1322 and copies the royal manuscript. For this, see Lacaze, <i>
Vie de Saint-Denis</i>
, 57-87; and Bähr, <i>
Saint Denis und seine Vita</i>
, 133-200, lxx-xciv. In an analysis of the history that forms the third part of the <i>
Vie de Saint Denis</i>
, Grémont suggested that B.N. lat. 5286 was an early fourteenth-century copy after B.N. fr. 2090-2092 and lat. 13836. For a summary of his findings, see Grémont, "Yves de Saint-Denis."</p><p class="indent">
A comparison of the illustration of the historical portion of B.N. lat. 13836 and the portions of B.N. lat. 5286 that correspond to it led me to disagree with Lacaze. The style of the miniatures in B.N. lat. 5286 is related generically to that of Artist I in John the Good's <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 (B.L. Royal 16 G VI), a manuscript painted c. 1335-40, so it is unlikely that this manuscript was the model for B.N. lat. 13836.</p><p class="indent">
To try to establish whether B.N. lat. 5286 copied B.N. lat. 13836, I compared the texts of 10 folios in B.N. lat. 13836 (fols. 87-97) with their equivalents in B.N. lat. 5286 (fols. 199-203). The results of this comparison make it unlikely that B.N. lat. 5286 copied the royal manuscript (B.N. lat. 13836) as Bähr and Grémont would have it. The Latin texts of the two manuscripts are not identical. However, because marginal corrections written in light brown ink in B.N. lat. 5286 relate to the text in B.N. lat. 13836, it is possible that the later copy was corrected after the royal manuscript. If this is true, then B.N. lat. 5286 is an important witness to the original cycle of B.N. lat. 13836, since some of the notes in B.N. lat. 5286 describe miniatures where pages are currently missing from B.N. lat. 13836 and where there is no illustration in B.N. lat. 5286. These notes and the pictures that illustrate the first portion of B.N. lat. 5286-a portion now lacking from B.N. lat. 13836-provide valuable insights into the appearance of the complete pictorial cycle of the copy presented to Philip V.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

22. The information regarding Thomas of Maubeuge's commission, appearing on fol. 1 in the introductory materials (fols. 1-6), is transcribed in the Catalogue of Manuscripts in this book.</p><p class="indent">
Thomas of Maubeuge was well-known as an editor and as one of the few <i>
libraires jurés</i>
 at Paris in 1316 and 1323. See Paul Delalain, <i>
Libraires Parisiens</i>
, 10-14, 18, 27; and Rouse, "Book Trade," 53-54, 102. His patrons came from the university and the nobility and even included

one king. Thomas sold books to Mahaut of Artois in 1313 and received a <i>
quittance</i>
 from her in 1329. See Chrétien César Auguste Dehaisnes, <i>
Histoire de l'art dans la Flandres, l'Artois, et le Hainaut avant le XV</i><sup>
e</sup>
 siècle (Lille, 1886), 432-33. Thomas sold a romance to the Count of Hainaut in 1323 and may have sold a "rommant de moralité sur le bible" to King John the Good in 1349. See Leopold Delisle, <i>
Le cabinet des manuscrits de la Bibliothèque Imperiale</i>
 (Paris, 1868-81), 1:15 n. 9, 3:304 n. 2; and Rouse, "Book Trade," 53-54.</p><p class="indent">
Elizabeth A. R. Brown's observation (letter of November 1989) that the colophon is written in the past tense raises some questions about the date of the manuscript's completion. The colophon refers to "Philip [V] who <i>
was</i>
 the son of Philip the Fair and brother of Louis [X]" (<i>
philippe qui fu filz phelippe li biaux</i>
), and mentions the commission in the past tense as well, "Pierre Honnorez of Neufchâtel in Normandy had [this book] written [<i>
fist escrire</i>
]. . . . by Thomas of Maubeuge . . . the year of grace of our Lord 1318."</p><p class="indent">
This colophon is written by the scribe (who completed the book through the life of Louis X) as the introduction to a genealogically structured table of contents on a gathering (fols. 1-6) added to the beginning of the book. Thus it is quite possible that the scribe might describe the task of producing the book, which was finished as he wrote the colophon, in the past tense. The reference in the past tense to Philip V, who died in 1322, may indicate that the book was not completed until after the king's death. This date may be supported by artistic evidence, because the artist who painted the first part of B.N. fr. 10132 also collaborated with the Master of the <i>
Roman de Fauvel</i>
 on a <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 (Castres, B.M.) that can be dated to the 1330s. See text pages 82-90.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
23. B.N. fr. 10132 was later continued with a French translation and continuation of the chronicle of Jean de Saint-Victor for events from 1316 to 1329. The version of Guillaume of Nangis's Life of Saint Louis that Thomas of Maubeuge uses in Pierre Honnorez's manuscript is different from that used in a contemporary courtly manuscript (B.N. fr. 2615), or slightly later in the manuscript made in the 1330s for John the Good when he was still dauphin (B.L. Royal 16 G VI), or in the continuation added to Cambrai, B.M. 682. See Spiegel, <i>

26. The earliest copies of the <i>
Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i>
 that I have consulted are from the thirteenth century; they include B.N. fr. 5700, whose text dates before 1285 (it contains a reference to Philip III, "Philippe qui ores et sera roi"); B.N. fr. 13565; and B.N. fr. 4961, which probably predates 1297, the date of the canonization of Saint Louis about whom it says, "et dist on qu'il est sainz." Fourteenth-century copies consulted include B.N. fr. 2815 (which contains the text of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 for descriptions of kings from Philip I to Philip III) and B.N. n. a. fr. 10043.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
27. When other illustrations are included in the <i>
Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i>
, they either reinforce the divisions of the text into three dynasties or focus on Clovis, the first Christian king of France. Thirteenth-century examples are simply illustrated. B.N. fr. 4961 begins with the genealogical diagrams. It has no illuminations, but vignetted initials mark the beginnings of the lives of Clovis (fol. 9), Pepin and Charlemagne (fol. 31), and Hugh Capet (fol. 67). B.N. fr. 13565 has a sequence of genealogical diagrams at the end of the manuscript and limits its illustration to an enthroned king at the prologue (fol. 1). B.N. fr. 5700 begins with genealogical charts, then prefaces the prologue with a full-page miniature
continue</p><p class="indent">
of four kings. This faces the page on which the prologue actually begins, which is illustrated by the baptism of Clovis.</p><p class="indent">
In the fourteenth century, manuscripts of the <i>
Abrégé de l'histoire de France</i>
 were revised to suppress a paragraph in the prologue that identifies the Ménestrel and to include a text close to the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 for descriptions of reigns from Philip I through Philip III. For this, see Spiegel, <i>
Chronicle Tradition</i>
, 82; and Mandach, <i>
Chronique</i>
, 148-51.</p><p class="indent">
Both fourteenth-century copies that I consulted suppress the genealogical charts common in the thirteenth-century redaction. One (B.N. n. a. fr. 10043) is an unillustrated book of small format. The other (B.N. fr. 2815) is of larger format and illustrated to reflect the two sources for its text. In the portion containing the Ménestrel's chronicle, combinations of miniatures and historiated initials mark the prologue (fol. 1, four kings) and the three races: the Merovingians (fol. 7, miniatures of Clovis's battle and baptism; historiated initial of an enthroned king), the Carolingians (fol. 25, miniature of the pope receiving a letter; historiated initial of King Pepin standing on a lion), and the Capetians (fol. 58v, miniature of Hugh Capet enthroned). In the portion derived from the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 are miniatures for the lives of Philip I (fol. 60v), Louis VI (fol. 74v), Louis VII (fol. 101v), Philip Augustus (fols. 118v, 136, 156, 163v), Louis VIII (fol. 172v), Louis IX (fol. 174v), and Philip III (fol. 182). None of these pictorial cycles have affinities with Thomas of Maubeuge's <i>

30. Thomas of Maubeuge's first model was a copy of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, which terminated at the end of Philip Augustus's life, where B.N. fr. 10132 now has a red "Éxplicit" (fol. 362). This "Éxplicit" seems to have been the terminus for the model alone, since B.N. fr. 10132 continues to fol. 400 with discussions of the events of 1223 to 1316 taken from the amplified chronicle of Guillaume de Nangis. In the mid-fourteenth century another scribe appended a translation and continuation of Jean de Saint-Victor's text to describe events from the accession of Louis X to 1330. Though illuminated, this later section has no directions to the illuminator and is unrubricated.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

33. Gilbert Ouy made these observations in a conversation on December 12, 1980. He also noted that when the directions to the rubricator were copied into the text, the scribe often made the forms more archaic. Thus on fol. 255 the marginal note reads, "Ci commence la vie au roi hue chapet," but the rubric that copies it states, "Ci commence la vie le roy hue chapet." These archaic literary forms are also used in the colophon identifying Thomas of Maubeuge.

35. In all but one case (fol. 299) where directions to the illuminator and rubricator appear on the same folio, the direction to the illuminator employs "il" to refer to "le roy," as described in the note to the rubricator, but the artist, who only read the direction addressed to him, neglected to include the king. See fols. 237, 256, 314, and 329v.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

38. Several copies of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 incorporate into their texts four extra passages, which I have transcribed from B.N. fr. 10132:</p><blockquote><p class="noindent">
I. Fol. 29v between Book I, chs. 15 and 16: "Ci devant raconte comment le roi cloovis fu Roys et comment il conquist soissons et mist empes tout son Royaume et comment .s.

This rubric has no miniature, but it does have an elaborate five-line decorated initial.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="noindent">
II. Fol. 32 before Book I, ch. 20: "Ci apres devise comment le Roi cloovis fu baptisiez de mesire saint Remi de Rains et une partie du peuple qui la estoit et comment nostre sire li envoia le saint cresme par le saint esperit en semblance de coulon en .i. vessel qui portoit a son bec. et comment il fonda sainte genevieve du mont a la requeste crotilde sa fame." This rubric is illustrated by the baptism of Clovis.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="noindent">
III. Fol. 36 before Book II, ch. 1: "Ci devise comment le Roy cloovis et sa fame crotilde sont en leur pales et comment les iiij fils sont devant euls et comment le roy devisa le royaume en .iiij. parties se que chascun sot a sener an sien royaume." This rubric is illustrated by Clovis and Clotilda standing in the presence of their four sons.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p class="noindent">
IV. Fol. 57 before Book III, ch. 1: "Ci endroit raconte comment le Roy chilperich espousa la suer brunechaut mes a ce temps tenoit il pluseurs fames en soingnantage dont il avint que lune de ses soingnans fist tent envers le Roy desus dit quil estrangla en son lit sa fame quil avoit espousee en son dormant." This rubric is illustrated by King Chilperic strangling his wife in her bed.</p></blockquote><p class="indent">
These passages appear either as rubrics or as texts that precede or follow rubrics between Book I, chapters 15 and 16; and preceding Book I, chapter 20; Book II, chapter 1; and Book III, chapter 1. They first survive in Thomas of Maubeuge's manuscript and never appear in royal copies of the text, although they are quite common in books produced by the late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century book trade.

John seems to have been very interested in the vernacular. Among his commissions for religious texts translated into French are the Bible of Jean de Sy (B.N. fr. 15397) and the densely illuminated <i>
Bible moralisée</i>
 (B.N. fr. 167). For these, see Paris, Grand Palais, <i>
Les fastes du gothique</i>

Decades</i>
 (I, III, and IV) to serve, as the prologue states, as a treatise of "political, military, and moral education." See Monfrin, "Humanisme et traduction," 172. Jean de Vignay's translation of the <i>
Échecs moralisés</i>
 of Jacques de Cessoles, done between 1337 and 1350, before John was king, translates Cessoles's text but introduces strictly political interpolations into John's copy. For this, see Beaune, <i>

26. Only five chapters are subdivided by illustrations. These occur once in Book III of the lives of the Merovingians (fol. 62, miracle at mass/ baptism of Jews/ death of Pricus/ Aetherius and the criminous clerk), twice in the life of Louis the Pious (fol. 203v, Louis receives a present of plate/ Saint Hilduin, abbot of Saint-Denis, translates the relics of Saints Peter, Paul, and Marcellus, and fol. 208, meeting of Louis the Pious and Pope Gregory), and three times in the life of Saint Louis (fol. 400v, assault on a castle by Tartars; fol. 403, the pope sends Bishop Odo to Paris where he preaches the crusade; and fols. 426v-427, Louis receives a letter from the pope that describes a series of attacks on the Holy Land).</p><p class="indent">
The illustration of chapters by multiple miniatures takes two forms: in six cases a pair of miniatures precedes a chapter, and in ten cases miniatures bracket their chapter—that is, one picture illustrating events from the first portion of the chapter precedes it, and a second picture illustrating an event described toward the end of the chapter follows it. With the exception of two instances (marked with question marks in the following list) the placement of rubrics in the chapter clarifies whether a sequence of pictures at the beginning of a chapter represents a double miniature (when both pictures follow the rubric) or bracketing miniatures (when a rubric follows the miniature that illustrates the end of the preceding chapter).</p><p class="indent">
Double miniatures include: fols. 151-151v, Charlemagne builds Aix-la-Chapelle/ the bridge over the Rhine burns, and Charlemagne gives orders to a bishop; fols. 158v-159, Charlemagne in council and the Crown of Thorns divided for Charlemagne; fols. 171-171v, a battle in which Agolant was killed, and a battle; fols. 251v-252 (?) the murder of Duke William, and King Louis IV takes custody of young Duke Richard; fol 306, the murder of Charles, Count of Flanders, and the murderers hanged; fols. 426v-427, Saint Louis in council receives a letter from the pope, and the battle of Tartars in the Holy Land (the event described in the letter).</p><p class="indent">

She believes that his choice was a deliberately anti-English gesture that promoted John, rather than Edward III, as legitimate successor to Louis IX.

3. Avril provides the most comprehensive list to date of works grouped around artists collectively known as the Master of the <i>
Roman de Fauvel</i>
. Known patrons include royalty (Queen Jeanne de Bourgogne, wife of Philip of Valois), government offices (the royal archives), and courtiers (Louis, duke of Bourbon; Guillaume Flote, chancellor of France). Avril associates the style employed in these books with Geoffroy of Saint-Léger who, like Thomas of Maubeuge, operated a shop on the Rue Neuve Nostre-Dame in Paris. Geoffroy was documented as both a bookseller and an illuminator. Avril speculates that the location of Geoffroy's shop in the Rue Neuve Nostre-Dame rather than in the university quarter may reflect a desire for a bourgeois audience. For this, see Avril's contribution in Roesner, ed., <i>
Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, MS fonds français 146</i>
. The three copies of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 (B.R. 5; Castres, B.M.; and Switzerland, private collection) that I am discussing here are closest stylistically to the manuscripts that Avril groups as the late work of the Master of the <i>
Roman de Fauvel</i>
, datable in the 1330s.</p><p class="indent">
For further discussion of Geoffroy of Saint-Léger, see Rouse, "Book Trade," 43, 53; and, for an analysis of notations made by Geoffroy in manuscripts that have made scholars question his role as illuminator, see Maurits Smeyers and Bert Cardon, "Brabant of Parijs?

Joan Diamond argues for a more restricted division of hands in the work attributed to the Master of the <i>
Roman de Fauvel</i>
. She identifies one artist whom she dubs the Royal Master (after a royal missal, B.L. Harley 2891), whose <i>
oeuvre

 corresponds in large part to the work that Avril describes as early Fauvel. See Udovitch, "The Papeleu Master." She believes the painter of the <i>
Roman de Fauvel</i>
 to be a follower of the Royal Master's style (letter of July 16, 1983). Her division of hands seems to be confirmed by the activity of both the Royal Master and the Master of <i>
Fauvel</i>
 in separate gatherings of B.N. fr. 2615, a <i>

 of c. 1315 discussed in Chapter 2 of this book.</p><p class="indent">
The closeness of style among different artists placed in this group is an example of what Joan Diamond describes as a period style. She demonstrates that individual artists worked together on temporary collaborations in styles that seemed to crystalize around particular text types. For example, she points out that the loose, rapid manner of the Royal Master seemed to be seen as particularly suited to vernacular books with text miniatures.

7. The only exception to the practice of drawing the subject matter of illustrations from the text is the illustration to the last book of Philip Augustus's life.

Livre des information des princes</i>

In both books the aspect of the script and the letter forms are identical, and such secondary details as the decoration for catchwords (a flourished box) and the abbreviation for <i>
nota</i>
 are the same. These stylistic comparisons are confirmed by the fact that marginal notes to the scribe in Ste.-Gen. 782, the textual model

25. Two of the peers included in these pictures may have been represented only by proxy. Although the county of Toulouse had reverted to the throne by the time of Charles V's reign, it is possible that Charles appointed someone to represent this ancient peerage. The chronicles of Charles V's coronation are silent on this point, but representation by proxy was a practice in the coronations of Charles VII in 1429 and of subsequent kings. If scholars are correct in asserting that Louis of Male, count of Flanders, did not attend Charles's coronation, he may have been represented by proxy as well. For the list of peers in the <i>

5. Chaplais, "1259 à 1303"; idem, "1303 à 1377". The homage before Philip IV is the most common representation of this ceremony in copies of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
. It occurs in 31 of the illuminated copies that I consulted. To my knowledge, no other manuscript pictures Henry III's homage before Saint Louis. Only two other royal manuscripts (B.N. fr. 10135 and B.L. Royal 20 C VII) include the homage of Edward III before Philip of Valois as the miniature for chapter 6 of Philip of Valois's life. In addition a small group of manuscripts with related iconography (B.N. fr. 2606; B.L. Add. 15269; Oxford, Douce 217; and Guildhall 244) begin the life of Philip of Valois with a scene of homage. The moment of the ceremony chosen in these images of homage varies, ranging from the <i>
osculum</i>
, or kiss; to variants of the <i>
immixtio manuum;</i>
 to transitional movements (for instance, advancing toward the king, extending a hand, or beginning to kneel). As we shall see, some of these pictures are comparable to the smaller images of homage appearing in the lives of Saint Louis and Philip of Valois in Charles V's <i>

12. Le Goff has studied the ritual of homage from an anthropological perspective, and although he points out that no medieval documents interpret the role of homage symbolically, he isolates components of the ritual: the homage (a verbal expression of willingness to serve and the <i>
immixtio manuum</i>
), the fealty (an oath), and the investiture of the fief (the presentation by the lord to the vassal of a symbolic object). He analyzes the <i>
immixtio manuum, osculum</i>
, and investiture in terms of the relationship that they embody between lord and vassal. He concludes that the <i>
immixtio manuum</i>
 creates an unequal relationship between lord and vassal, the <i>
osculum</i>
 makes them equal, and the investiture involves the lord and vassal in a reciprocal arrangement. See Jacques le Goff, "The Symbolic Ritual of Vassalage," in <i>
Time, Work, and Culture in the Middle Ages</i>

Recent research by Palmer has made interpretation of these passages and analysis of Froissart's work as a whole more difficult. Palmer demonstrates that all existing manuscripts of Froissart's chronicle contain references to historical events that date their composition to the 1390s at the earliest. In addition, he shows that no purely first or second editions of the text exist; each manuscript contains a mixture of what may originally have been first and second redactions.

It is likely that this passage was part of the original version. The text on homage appears in each version of the chronicle except the Amiens manuscript (which Palmer has shown was edited to be pro-French and whose authenticity as a work of Froissart's needs further exploration).

Descent from Saint Louis remained a popular theme in Valois programs throughout the reigns of the last Valois kings at the end of the fifteenth century. During this late period it found expression in public celebrations rather than chronicle illustration or political treatises. For example, <i>
tableaux vivants</i>
 in royal entries often depicted a royal version of the tree of Jesse, with Saint Louis as originator of the line. For studies of royal entries, see Bernard Guenée and Françoise Lehoux, <i>
Les entrées royales françaises de 1328 à 1515</i>
 (Paris, 1968); and Lawrence Bryant, <i>
The King and the City in the Parisian Royal Entry Ceremony: Politics, Ritual, and Art in the Renaissance</i>
, Travaux d'Humanisme et Renaissance, no. 216 (Geneva, 1986). For a discussion of the popularity of Saint Louis in the late fifteenth century, see Hindman and Spiegel, "Fleur-de-lis Frontispiece," 381-407.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
32. Written early in the fourteenth century, Saint-Pathus's text focuses exclusively on the youth and charitable acts of Saint Louis as pictured in the frontispiece. The eleventh chapter discusses his charity toward the poor and the sick and his care for the dead and cites among other examples Saint Louis's custom of washing the feet of several poor monks each Saturday, his kindness toward the leper monk of Royaumont, and his burial of the decomposed bodies at Sidon. Chapter 14 describes Louis's penitence and cites as one instance his submission to scourging by his confessor. The <i>
Vie de Saint Louis</i>
 by Guillaume de Saint-Pathus established the order of the pictures in the frontispiece. See Saint-Pathus, <i>
Vie de Saint Louis</i>
, 80, 94-95, 99-102, 122-23. The illustrations of Saint Louis's care for the leper of Royaumont, Saint Louis washing the feet of the poor, the burial of the Crusaders' bones at Sidon, and Saint Louis's submission to scourging by his confessor are identical in iconography to many Capetian images. The iconography of the miniature depicting the education of Saint Louis, to be discussed below, is not as close. For these Capetian commissions see Chapter 1, note 9. The <i>
Vie de Saint Louis</i>
 does not describe the birth of Louis IX. To my knowledge, no other commission based on Saint-Pathus's text illustrates this scene.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

36. The issue of the proper education of a prince, important to Charles V, was the subject of literary discussion during his son's reign. Philip de Mézières, appointed tutor to the dauphin by Charles V, expressed his own views on the education of princes in a book, <i>
Le songe du vieil pelerin</i>
, addressed to the young Charles VI in the 1390s. It stresses the importance of education as one of many themes and cites Louis IX and Charles V as two kings who took an active role in educating themselves and their children. A second text to laud Charles V is Christine de Pizan's <i>
Le livre des fais et bonnes meurs du sage roi Charles V</i>
, commissioned by Charles's brother Philip the Bold of Burgundy in 1404. This eulogistic biography puts great stress on the king's intellectual accomplishments and his good government. Numerous books, sermons, and letters written by members of the court and university community during the last portion of the fourteenth century and the early fifteenth century focus, as do Philip de Mézières's and Christine de Pizan's works, on the important problem of a prince's education. For discussion of these texts and of the ideal education for a prince in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, and for reference to the influence of the models of Saint Louis and Charles V, see Krynen, <i>

Fourteenth-century accounts of the capture of Jerusalem do not describe the English king as being (or having been) present. For instance, a manuscript of the <i>
Roman de Godefroi de Bouillon</i>
 dated 1337 that compiles the first and second cycles of the crusades (B.N. fr. 22495) specifies who was with Godfrey: "asses tost empres le duc entrent eu li cuens de flandres, li ducs de normandie, Tancred le vailla[n]s, hue li cuens de saint-paul, bauduin de borc, Gascel de bediers &amp; mainte autre bon chevalier que l'en ne peust pas toz nommer" (fol. 70).

Les fastes du gothique</i>
, 410, no. 350.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
45. The English king's presence was noted as anachronistic by Loomis, "Secular Dramatics," 251. However, she viewed the inclusion of the English king, whom she identified as Richard the Lionheart from the Third Crusade, as a mistake occasioned by the influence of "a familiar representation of the <i>
Pas Saladin</i>
." I believe that the fidelity with which extratextual detail is presented in this manuscript makes her interpretation unlikely. Loomis's own observation (based on a comparison of the description of the play in 1378 with a description of a play of the <i>
Pas Saladin</i>
 [1389] in Froissart's chronicle) that the same set may have been used in both plays supports an interpretation of the details in the miniature as realistic.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

Other anachronisms—the use of the arms of Jerusalem, which were not yet extant at the time of the First Crusade, and the representation of a crowned Godfrey before he had captured the city and been crowned—might be caused by a need to identify Godfrey with an attribute of kingship (a crown) and reference to his domain (Jerusalem).</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

19. The earliest known instance of the pairing of Saints Denis and Louis in a secular celebration occurred in a <i>
mystère</i>
 at the entry of Charles VII into Paris in 1437. Even in this entry, Saints Denis and Louis appeared in a quasi-religious context; they were grouped in one scene with other saints popular in Paris—Thomas, Maurice, and Geneviève—as one of a series of <i>
mystères</i>
 that included the seven deadly sins, the seven virtues, and scenes from the life of Christ. Bryant considers that their presence at the Painter's Gate refers to the king's juridical obligations. On this entry, see Guenée and Lehoux, <i>
Entrées royales</i>

A painting of circa 1350 from Saint Michael's chapel in the royal palace commemorated the attachment of the Dauphiné to France in a picture that showed Blanche of Navarre; Philip of Valois; and the dauphin, Charles, at the crucifixion, under the protection of Saint Louis and Saint Denis. In the reign of Charles VII (circa 1450) a painting done for the Parlement of Paris showed Saint Louis (a portrait of Charles VII), Saint Denis, Saint Charlemagne, and Saint John the Baptist flanking a crucifixion.

Although only two identifiable manuscripts produced for the book trade survive, other sources enable us to construct a broader picture of ownership for these books. Guenée rightly suggests that surviving inventories and other marks of ownership point to a restricted audience of kings and princes of France, close counsellors to the king, and nobles. Of those in government service, only members of the chancery demonstrated an interest in the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, and that was mostly in the late fifteenth century. Members of other governmental groups seem not to have owned these chronicles. Thus, in a study of libraries of members of Parlement during the reign of Charles VI, Autrand found only <i>
compendia</i>
 (like that of Vincent of Beauvais), ancient history, and Trojan history. See Guenée, <i>
Histoire et culture historique</i>

4. Although Meiss dates three of these manuscripts (Phillipps 1917, M. 536, and Mazarine 2028) between 1410 and 1412, I believe that the manuscripts now in the Bibliothèque Mazarine and in Berlin are of earlier date. The other books in which the <i>
Épistre</i>
 Master, the second artist in Mazarine 2028, worked date from 1403-1408. Further, the secondary decoration in the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 in Paris is closer to that in other manuscripts painted c. 1405-1407 by the Master of the <i>
Cité des Dames</i>
 and the <i>
Épistre</i>
 Master than it is to the chronicles in Brussels and New York painted around 1410 by the Master of the <i>
Cité des Dames</i>
.</p><p class="indent">
Finally, Phillipps 1917 bears the closest stylistic relationship to the <i>
Épistre Othéa</i>
 in B.L. Harley 4431, a book dated by Hindman to 1408-10/15. For Meiss's dating of these manuscripts, see Meiss, <i>

5. Beaune outlines the growth in popularity of emblems and devices when these manuscripts were made in the early fifteenth century. She suggests that until approximately 1382 armorial displays were most common in royal and noble clothing. Between approximately 1382 and 1450, however, kings and princes began to distribute to one another and to their followers clothing marked with devices, emblems, and mottos that frequently reflected current politics. By the latter half of the fifteenth century, the proliferation of symbolic emblems abated, and royalty sought to distinguish themselves through dress from their followers. See Beaune, "Costume et pouvoir en France," 125-46 and 127-28 especially. For further discussion of orders, see Philippe Contamine, <i>
Guerre, état et société à la fin du Moyen-Âge</i>
 (Paris, 1972), 668-76. For an example of a complicated program in which an

6. B.R. 4 originally contained the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 from the Trojan origins through the life of Philip Augustus. This portion of the book dates from the first half of the fourteenth century. In the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century it was continued through the description of the death of Louis of Male in 1384. The incipits of this manuscript correspond to those cited in a description of a book belonging to Philip the Bold in the inventory made in 1420 after the death of Philip's son, John the Fearless: "no. 153. Item. ung autre livre des croniques de France couvert de cuir rouge à deux fermoeurs d'argent dorez, armoriez aux armes de feu monseigneur le duc Philippe l'un rond et l'autre quarré commencant ou IIe fueillet <i>
Fil en sa prison</i>
 et au derrenier fueillet <i>
Le roy d'engleterre</i>
." It probably corresponds to the reference in the inventory done after Philip the Bold's death in 1404: "Premièrement les croniques de France fermans à deux fermoeurs d'argent armoriez aux armes de feu mondit seigneur." For this identification, see Georges Doutrepont, <i>

Most copies of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 from the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries include in their description of the imperial visit chapters 62-65, the second half of 66, and 77-79 in the life of Charles V. In place of these seventeen and a half chapters, B.R. 4 and M. 536 include versions of the following passage: "En cellui temps mil ccc lxxvii l'empereur de romme Charles le iiij<sup>

 de ce nom vint veoir le roy de france Charles son nepueu à paris qui lui fist très parfaitement grant chière et très honnorablement et grandement le receut et le tient plusieurs jours.

Et luy fist pluseurs notables et grans dons de vaissiaux d'or et d'argent de reliques et autres ioyaux" (M. 536, fol. 363v).</p><p class="indent">
M. 536 edits the text of the life of Charles V most actively. Whereas the lives of Philip of Valois and John the Good in M. 536 have different chapter divisions than in Delachenal's edition, their text corresponds to it. The life of Charles V, however, omits the text of chapters 13-14 (attempts to negotiate the marriage of Philip the Bou:ld, 1368), 19-20 (letters sent between France and England), 22 (treaty regarding the marriage of Philip the Bold and Margaret of Flanders), 25-26 (trip of the duke of Burgundy to Paris; the raising of taxes), 53-79 (the imperial visit), 82-84 (burial of Queen Jeanne of Bourbon), 89 (confession of Jacques la Rue), 93-97 (papal election of Urban VI, then his rejection and Clement VII's election), and 101 (a recapitulation of the papal election). I cannot state with certainty that B.R. 4 and M. 536 contain identical texts, because I have not collated them.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
8. Because the Rolin arms were added to the initial, it is difficult to say with certainty that the chronicle was made expressly for a member of the Rolin family. Further, the arms are <i>
engrélé</i>
, which usually means that the book belonged to a third son, although these are not the arms of Nicholas's third son, Jean Rolin, as described by Fontenay. For more on Rolin, his family, and his patronage, see Charles Bigarne, <i>

The canopies in these scenes of presentation vary in the distribution of color; in the manuscript in the Morgan Library the canopy is green and the fringe red and white, while in the chronicle in Berlin the canopy is red and the fringe green and white.

Hindman suggests that the selection of red, green, and white may have had Burgundian overtones as well. For their use as Burgundian colors, see Hindman, <i>
Épistre Othéa</i>
, 120. Beaune cautions that Burgundian colors were not used as systematically as royal ones; white, green, and red predominate in Burgundian documents, but they were frequently used in pairs (white and red or green and red). See Beaune, "Costume et pouvoir," 143. De Vaivre is even more tentative in his discussion of color, cautioning that the use of colors was flexible and that, as a result, colors cannot be identified as closely with a person as his device (verbal motto or visual motif) may be. For this, see Jean-Bernard de Vaivre, "À propos des devices de Charles VI," <i>
Bulletin Monumental</i>
 141 (1983): 93.</p><p class="indent">
Nonetheless, a consideration of the archival material published by Delaborde makes clear that, while robes of red, of green, or of red, white, and green might be commissioned for the duke or for members of his family, only three entries mention colors specifically as part of the duke of Burgundy's devices. At least in 1412, the date of all three references, John the Fearless's colors were white, green, and black. The first describes a payment, "pour iii aulnes de vert, blanc et noir, dont on a fait les brodeures de la devise de MdS [mon dit seigneur] sur lesdittes houppellandes." The second records a payment for the embroidery on the sleeves of eight robes of a large plane, three branches of broom, and leaves "faittes à sa devise et de ses trois couleurs." Although the second reference does not specify what his three colors were, a subsequent entry that commissions harnesses does: "à chascun desdis harnoix, deux pendans de trois couleurs, l'une blanche, l'autre verde, et l'autre noire, lesquels sont semez de rabos et de couppeaux de laton doré, à la devise de MdS."

Les ducs de Bourgogne</i>
, part 2 (Paris, 1849-52), 1:70 no. 219, 84 no. 239, 90 no. 259. Thus it is highly unlikely that the colors in the frontispieces to the <i>

The picture of Menelaeus in Phillipps 1917 may have been intended as a kind of "device," like the collar of mail from the Order of the Porcupine that identifies Louis of Orléans, the hammer that identifies John of Burgundy, and the imperial arms that identify Aeneas.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
17. Although the arms are not precisely those of Pope Alexander (<i>

For example, during the period of John the Fearless's guardianship, very few of the dauphin's staff were Burgundian appointments. By 1413 the dukes of Guyenne and Burgundy were at odds; from then until he died, Louis opposed John the Fearless. For this, see Famiglietti, <i>

It is impossible to determine whether references to the Burgundian-Orléanist conflict were avoided in this particular image in the manuscript in Berlin because they cast the Duke of Burgundy in a negative light. This may be possible since the figure who was identified negatively as the Duke of Burgundy in the manuscript now in the Bibliothèque Mazarine is, in the book now in Berlin, the only son to mimic his mother's distinctive hand gesture, perhaps identifying with the saintly, conciliatory behavior of Clotilda, a former princess of Burgundy.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

Indeed Isabeau's power gained through her son was such that the government stopped when she fled Paris with the dauphin after the execution of John of Montaigu in 1409. This precipitated John the Fearless's treaty of friendship with Isabeau when he recognized her important political role. However, John was named sole guardian later in that year, when Isabeau received her own treasury, apparently in exchange for surrendering the <i>
tutelle</i>
 of the dauphin to John the Fearless. For this, see Maurice Rey, <i>

5. Of the approximately 30 copies of the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 that survive from the mid-fifteenth century, at least 20 were unillustrated; of these 20, 18 were written on paper or on paper gatherings with outer leaves of parchment. Colophons provide an idea of the audience for these books. They seem to have been written by notaries for their own use or by scribes for the use of other bureaucrats. Thus on the last page of B.N. fr. 4955 is a signature by a notary and secretary to Charles VII: "Escript par moy, Pierre de Taise. 1460.—de Taise." B.N. fr. 2612, fol. 319v, contains the inscription: "Ces croniques ont estre escriptes de la main de Nahei Fertuag pour maistre Jehan Blondeau praticien en la court de perlement.

These books usually included the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
 to the 1380s and supplemented the chronicle with other histories to continue it to the late fifteenth century. Although the first edition was unillustrated, the 951 woodcuts from Antoine Vérard's edition in 1493 established the pictorial cycle for subsequent printed versions of the text. Few of the pictures in Vérard's densely illustrated book relate closely to their texts. Original pictures created for the book are repeated several times without alteration within the cycle of illustrations, but the majority of the images were adapted without change from sources that had absolutely no relationship to the chronicle. Illustrations come from sources as diverse as the Old Testament (Samson, or Absalom hanging from a tree by his hair), ancient history (Battle of Amazons), or Josephus. Even the title to the last printed edition of the chronicle confirms that Guillaume Eustache viewed it in a different light. He sought to present the chronicle as a universal history; the title includes a list of nations whose histories were described in the <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>

Other manuscripts may belong in this first group. For instance, Royal 16 G VI, John the Good's <i>
Grandes Chroniques</i>
, contains 412 miniatures painted by at least six artists. Only once do two artists work in one gathering; Artist VI paints a bifolium in a gathering decorated by another artist. Similarly, Cotton Nero E II (a book from the early fifteenth century that contains the royal arms) contains only one gathering (no. 22) in which artists collaborated.</p><p class="indent">
A third manuscript from this group may well belong in the other. The Virgil Master and a close follower collaborated on two gatherings in W. 139, a manuscript in which several different artists were at work. If the artist who collaborated with the Virgil Master (and emulated his style) was an assistant, they may have worked in the same shop.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">
4. The group of manuscripts in which artists collaborated on gatherings also includes B.N. fr. 20350, a late fourteenth-century manuscript whose arms suggest that it may have been royal, and B.N. fr. 20352-53, an early fifteenth-century book.</p></div><div class="note"><p class="noindent">

Although the majority of the books listed in the Catalogue of Manuscripts were either illustrated by one artist or have no surviving miniatures,<sup class="ref">[1]</sup> 26 manuscripts were painted by two or more artists. These can be divided into two groups: one in which the basic units of the book were gatherings on which (once they had been told what subject to paint) the assigned artists worked independently and produced books that combine diverse styles, and another in which artists collaborated on individual gatherings and seem to have worked more more closely together, since the style of the miniatures in these manuscripts is much more homogeneous. The first group seems to have been produced independently of the court.<sup class="ref">[2]</sup> Although it includes the first <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> presented to Philip III, most of its books are nonroyal; among them are the chronicle supervised by Thomas of Maubeuge, Jeanne d'Amboise's manuscript in Castres (which may be associated with Geoffroy of Saint-Léger), and the group of three books that follow directions to the illuminator preserved in the margins in the chronicle in Valenciennes.<sup class="ref">[3]</sup></p><p class="normal">Most manuscripts in the second group are from the royal circle of Charles V; they include Charles V's chronicle (B.N. fr. 2813) and several books copied after it for John of Berry (Ex-Bute) and Charles VI (B.N. fr. 10135 and B.N. fr. 2608).<sup class="ref">[4]</sup> These may be commissions executed for court by the group of <i>libraires</i> , artists, scribes, and binders who worked for the king. Their distribution of hands suggests that the artistic unit was an individual bifolium. Closer supervision by the <i>libraire</i> might account for their homogeneity of style.</p><p class="normal">Whereas several painters who decorated these chronicles were sophisticated artists (for example, the Master of the Coronation of Charles V, the Master of the Coronation Book, the Master of the Bible of Jean de Sy, the Boucicaut Master, the Virgil Master, or the Master of the <i>Cité des Dames</i> ), many more were artists whose work is less refined and, perhaps because of this, unpublished. Their style is similar to the hasty, economical style popularized in the early fourteenth century for vernacular illustration.<sup class="ref">[5]</sup> They work on the unadorned parchment ground in grisaille or in ink sketches colored with thin washes of color. In order to begin to document the activity of these less sophisticated painters and to provide comparative material for better known artists, I append a list of artists who painted more than one <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> .</p><hr class="pb" /><div align="center">― <span class="run-head">184</span> ―</div><p class="noindent">Artist of B.N. fr. 2597:<br /><i>Épistre Othéa</i> (Cambridge, Newnham College Library, Ms. 900 95)<sup class="ref">[6]</sup></p><p class="normal">Artist I of Baltimore, W. 138:<br /> W. 138 (Artist I); Valenciennes, B.M. 637 (Artist IV)</p><p class="normal">Artist I of Baltimore, W. 139:<br /> W. 139 (Artist I); B.N. fr. 2814</p><p class="normal">Artist I of Brussels, B.R. 2:<br /> W. 126, dated 1402–10 (Artist II); B.R. 2 (Artist I); B.N. fr. 23140 (main miniature and patterns of marginal decoration); Munich, Cod.

Each manuscript description is divided into several categories. In the Collation section, the numeral preceding the parentheses indicates the number of the gathering, the numeral within the parentheses refers to the first folio of the gathering, and the numeral that follows tells how many folios made up the gathering. When applicable, notes describe whether a folio was inserted into (<i>tipped</i> ) or missing from (<i>lacks</i> ) the gathering or whether an unused folio was cut (<i>excised</i> ) from the gathering. Detailed incipits are provided, since medieval inventories frequently quote either the first line of the second folio of the manuscript or the first line of the second folio of the chronicle's text, as well as the first line of the last folio. The explicits are useful for preliminary grouping of textual families.</p><p class="normal">The Miniatures section lists the folio number, text citation (which follows the text divisions in Viard's and Delachenal's critical editions), and subject of each picture. These text citations aid in the comparison of cycles in different manuscripts. I also note when miniatures have been cut out or when offsets indicate that a missing page had illustrations. Only when a miniature deviates from a normal, single-column width is its scale described; the abbreviation FPM indicates a full-page miniature and HI a historiated initial.</p><p class="normal">The Style section records the number of artists who worked on each chronicle. Any who worked on other copies of the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> are cited in Appendix I. The Provenance section provides evidence derived from inventories, signatures, and heraldry about the earliest owners of these manuscripts. The References section lists publications relevant to the manuscripts. Full bibliographical references for works cited more than three times are provided in the Selected Bibliography. Publications that concentrate on manuscript style are noted in Appendix I.</p><p class="normal">The abbreviations <i>T</i> and <i>R</i> stand for text and rubric. The plus signs (+, ++, +++) refer to sequences of pictures that subdivide chapters.</p><p class="normal">Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery, W. 138<br /><i>Grandes Chroniques de France</i> (from Philip Augustus to 1380)</p><p class="normal">COLLATION: 1(1)8–22(169)8; 23(177)10; 24(187)8–27(211)8; 28(219)10; 29(229)4, 4th excised; 30(232)8–33(256)8; 34(264)8, 8th excised. <i>Incipits:</i> This manuscript begins with signature <i>j</i> ; thus 8–9 gatherings are missing.

On fol. 374v is a signature of Charles V (see <i>Librairie</i> ). Delisle was unable to locate this book in the inventories of Charles V, perhaps because of confusion about the text on the second folio. I have identified this manuscript with a book inventoried in the royal collection in 1373 that was still in the collection in 1411, 1413, and 1423. "986: Unes Croniques de France, en françois, couvertes de veluyau à fleurs de lis, a trois bouillons d'argent, escriptes de lettre de forme à deux coulombes.

Il les a rendues" [note found in update in 1380 of inventory of 1373]. The prologue ends and the text of the chronicle begins on fol. 2v; thus the second full page of the chronicle's text is fol. 4 ("empères . ."), but the second folio to contain text of the chronicle is fol. 3 ("contrée . . .
