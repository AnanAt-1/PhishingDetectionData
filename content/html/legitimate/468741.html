The  Whipple  Home  School  for  the 

Deaf, 


MYSTIC,  CONNECTICUT, 
1869-1893. 


By  MARGARET  WHIPPLE  HAMMOND, 

Stiferintendent  of  the  School. 


THE  WHIPPLE  HOME  SCHOOL  FOE  THE  DEAF. 

The  Whipple  Home  School  was  founded  by  Jonathan  and 
Zerah  Whipple  about  twenty  years  ago. 

Jonathan  Whipple  had  a  deaf  son,  Enoch,  who  is  still  living, 
at  the  age  of  sixty-eight  years.  Jonathan  observed  that  Enoch 
watched  his  mouth  very  closely  while  he  was  talking,  and  that 
if  Enoch  did  this  he  understood  him.  He  also  found  that  by 
having  Enoch  watch  his  mouth  whUe  he  pronounced  different 
words  the  boy  would  speak  distinctly,  when  otherwise  he 
failed.  Jonathan  Whipple  was  a  man  of  indomitable  will  and 
perseverance  and  he  determined  to  teach  his  son  to  speak  and 
read  the  lips  well.  This  he  succeeded  in  doing,  so  that  now 
there  is  certainly  no  better  living  example  of  the  value  of  this 
method  of  teaching  the  deaf  than  Enoch  Whipple.  He  reads 
the  lips  perfectly,  speaks  sonorously  and  distinctly,  and  is  a 
man  of  strict  integrity  and  broad  cultivation. 

Jonathan  Whipple  at  all  times  advocated  this  method  of 
teaching  the  deaf,  but  no  real  plans  for  a  school  materialized 
untU  his  grandson,  Zerah  Whipple,  was  about  twenty  years 
old.  Zerah  was  a  thoughtful  young  man  and  a  good  student. 
He  became  greatly  interested  in  his  grandfather's  methods 
and  determined  to  devote  his  life  to  the  instruction  of  the 
deaf  by  the  oral  method.  This  he  did  conscientiously  and 
well.  He  invented  the  Whipple's  Natural  Alphabet,  which  is 
atUl  of  great  assistance  to  the  teachers  in  their  work. 

The  School  was  quite  extensively  advertised,  and  it  grew  in 
numbers  until  a  dozen  or  so  pupils  from  all  parts  of  the 
United  States,  and  from  little  children  to  grown  men  and 
women,  were  under  his  instruction.  In  a  few  years  Zerah 
purchased  from  the  heirs  of  one  of  Mystic's  deceased  wealthy 
citizens  his  former  summer  residence  and  moved  his  little 
School  there.  This  was  an  admirable  situation  for  the  School, 
and  its  location  has  not  since  been  changed.  The  house  is 
little  over  a  mile  from  the  village  of  Mystic,  healthfuUy  buUt 
and  situated  on  a  high  hill,  commanding  a  beautiful  view  of 
the  vUlage,  river,  and  sound.  One  can  judge  of  the  healthful- 
ness  of  the  location  of  the  School  from  the  remarks  of  one  of 
the  teachers.     She  casually  observed  that  she  had  taught  there

two  years  and  the  services  of  a  physician  had  not  been  re- 
quired for  any  scholar  during  that  time. 

Zerah  Whipple  did  not  make  a  success  of  the  School  finan- 
cially, as  he  was  never  able  to  lift  the  mortgage  from  the  prop- 
erty ;  but  he  was  a  wonderful  teacher,  as  all  of  his  pupils  wiU 
testify. 

At  first  the  School  was  supported  by  the  parents  of  the 
pupils  and  friends  of   the    School,    making  in  all  about  three 


THE  WHIPPLE  HOME  SCHOOL  FOR  THE  DEAF. 


hundred  dollars  a  year  for  each  pupil.  Finally  Zerah  suc- 
ceeded in  persuading  the  State  legislature]  of  Connecticut  and 
later  that  of  New  Jersey  to  appropriate  one  hundred  and  sev- 
enty-five dollars  a  year  for  each  pupil  [from  its  State.  This 
secured  the  advantages  of  his  School,  to  the  poor,  but  added 
nothing  to  his  finances,  for  more  teachers  were  needed  and 
they  absorbed  the  profits. 

Zerah  Whipple  died  while  still  a  young  man,  with  his  work 
but  just  begun.  His  brother-in-law,  Frank  Whipple,  soon 
took  charge  of  the  School,  and  about  this  time  the  State  of 
New  Jersey  withdrew  its   appropriation   and   transferred  its

pupils  to  the  Trenton  sign  school.  In  the  meanwhile  deaf 
schools  had  been  established  in  many  of  the  other  States,  the 
advertising  ceased,  and  soon  the  School  numbered  no  paying 
pupils  outside  of  the  State  of  Connecticut. 

Frank  Whipple  did  not  make  a  financial  success  of  the 
school,  the  number  of  pupils  gradually  decreasing  until, 
about  six  years  ago,  he  was  offered  a  position  as  articulation 
teacher  in  the  Cahfornia  Institution  at  Berkeley.  This  he  ac- 
cepted, and  an  aunt  of  Zerah  Whipple's,  Mrs.  Margaret  Whip-

pie  Hammond,  assumed  charge  of  the  School.  It  again  began 
to  increase  in  numbers,  and  now  for  several  years  it  has 
averaged  about  twenty  pupils.  Two  regular  teachers  and  one 
assistant  teacher  are  employed.  The  assistant  teaches  and 
observes  and  takes  care  of  the  girls  out  of  school-hours.  A 
man  is  employed  to  take  charge  of  the  boys  out  of  school. 

This  School  is  and  has  always  been  conducted  on  the 
strictly  oral  plan.  No  signs  have  ever  been  taught  in  the 
School,  and  the  use  of  them  has  at  all  times  been  discouraged. 
Every  child  is  taught  articulation  and  lip-reading,  and  by 
means  of  these  the  English  branches  are  taught. 


6  The  Whipple  Home  School. 

The  School  session  begins  the  second  Wednesday  in  Sep- 
tember and  closes  the  first  Friday  in  June,  with  about  a  week's 
vacation  at  Christmas- time,  when  the  children  may  either  go 
home  or  remain  at  School.  Most  of  the  vegetables,  milk,  and 
eggs  are  supplied  by  the  farm  attached  to  the  School,  and  the 
strawberries  raised  there  are  sold  to  the  merchants  of  the  vil 
lage  in  exchange  for  groceries. 

The  boys  help  about  the  farm  out  of  school-hours,  and  the 
girls  learn  to  cook,  sew,  and  help  about  the  housework. 

In  the  past  two  years  neither  parents  nor  friends  of  the 
School  have  given  over  twenty-five  doUars  for  any  pupil,  but 
with  the  help  from  the  farm  and  the  State  appropriation  of 
$175  for  each  pupil  the  School  has  been  maintained  comfort- 
ably and  well.  The  School  is,  as  its  name  indicates,  a  Some 
School.  All,  including  the  scholars,  are  members  of  one  large 
family.  All  eat  at  the  same  table,  use  a  common  sitting-room^ 
and  are  in  all  respects  made  to  feel  as  if  they  were  at  home. 

The  School  is  evenly  divided  between  the  two  teachers  and 
graded  as  carefully  as  possible.  Much  individual  attention  is 
given  to  each  scholar,  the  assistant  being  always  ready  to 
devote  extra  time  to  those  pupils  who  may  need  it  most.  The 
teachers  are  supplied  with  aU  books  and  apparatus  that  they 
think  will  assist  them  in  their  work,  though  the  general  School 
library  is  small,  no  donations  from  outside  having  ever  been 
made  to  it.  Great  pains  are  taken  to  awaken  an  interest  in 
the  pupils  in  reading,  and  all  the  books  and  periodicals  that 
the  means  of  the  School  will  allow  are  procured.  The  proprie- 
tors of  the  School  are  glad  at  all  times  to  entertain  any  one 
who  may  wish  to  visit  the  School  and  see  what  is  there  being 
accomplished. 

The  present  ofiicers  of  the  School  are  : 

Mrs.  Maegaket  Hammond, Superintendent. 

Miss  Ida  Hewitt, Teacher. 

Miss  Lizzie  Donohue, " 

Miss  Grace  Adams, Assistant  Teacher.

society  whose  object  was  to  erect  an  orphanage  for  orphans  of 
the  Lutheran  Church  within  the  State  of  Michigan.     For  this

purpose  ten  acres  of  land  were  purchased  some  twelve  miles 
west  of  Detroit,  within  the  confines  of  Royal  Oak,  Oakland 
county,  Michigan,  on  which  was  erected  a  building  of  adequate 
dimensions  for  the  time.  The  Eev.  G.  Speckhard,  then  pastor 
of  a  society  in  Sebewaing,  Huron  county,  Michigan,  was  called 
to  take  charge  of  the  orphanage.  Pastor  Speckhard  accejjted 
the  call  and  assumed  charge  of  the  orphanage,  and  also  of  the 
Lutheran  congregation  at  Royal  Oak.  He  was  accompanied 
by  two  deaf-mute  children,  natives  of  Saginaw  county,  Michi- 
gan, whom  he  had  already  for  several  years  successfully  in- 
structed by  the  German  oral  method,  and  whose  parents  desired 
that  he  should  continue  to  so  instruct  them  in  order  to  enable 
them  to  be  confirmed  in  the  Lutheran  faith.  This  system  of 
orally  instructing  the  deaf  was  well  known  to  Pastor  Speck- 
hard, as  he  had  twenty  years  previously  taught  the  same  in  the 
German  Deaf-Mute  Institution  at  Priedberg,  in  the  Grand 
Duchy  of  Hesse- Darmstadt — a  system  of  instruction  then  un- 
known not  only  in  the  State  of  Michigan,  but  also  in  other 
States  of  the  Union.  Nevertheless,  this  system  met  with 
speedy  approval,  and  consequently,  within  ten  months,  no  fewer 
than  fifteen  deaf-mute  pupils  had  presented  themselves  to  the 
Rev.  Mr.  Speckhard  for  German  oral  instruction.  This  unex- 
pectedly compelled  the  society  in  question  either  to  decide  on 
carrying  out  their  original  design  of  establishing  an  orphan 
asylum  or  to  found  an  institution  for  deaf-mutes,  because  to 
conduct  and  sustain  two  benevolent  institutions  having  entirely 
different  ends  in  view  was  out  of  the  question.  After  mature 
deliberation,  it  was  decided  to  found  a  deaf-mute  institution, 
more  especially  because,  meanwhile,  other  provisions  had  been 
made  for  orphans  by  the  establishment  of  an  orphanage  at 
Addison,  Du  Page  county,  in  the  adjoining  State  of  Illinois, 
where  also  the  orphans  of  Michigan  could  be  accommodated, 
and  more  especially  because  an  institution  under  the  auspices 
of  the  Lutheran  Church  where  deaf-mutes  of  the  Lutheran 
faith  could  be  instructed  had  been  seriously  desired  for  some 
time  past.  The  orphans,  therefore,  were  transferred  to  the 
Home  at  Addison,  and  the  Michigan  Institute  was  then  incor- 
porated, and  devoted  exclusively  to  the  instruction  of  deaf- 
mutes  according  to  the  German  oral  method. 

The  existing  structure,  which  soon  proved  inadequate,  ne- 
cessitated plans  for  enlargement.  As,  however,  for  divers 
reasons,  it  became  desirable  to  have   the  Institution  in  the 


The  German  Lat/ieran  Institution.  5 

vicinity  of  the  city  of  Detroit,  a  suitable  location  was  looked  for, 
whereupon  a  noble-minded  American,  Mr.  Philetus  William 
Norris,  of  Norris,  Wayne  county,  Michigan,  tendered  to  the  as- 
sociation the  generous  gift  of  twenty  acres  of  land,  improved 
with  sundry  farm  buildings,  provided  the  Institution  should  be 
removed  to  Norris.  This  praiseworthy  oifer  was  gratefully 
accepted.  At  once  arrangements  were  made  to  erect  there  a 
suitable  building  to  accommodate  some  fifty  pupils.  The 
structure  was  commenced,  proceeded  satisfactorily,  and  was 
happily  completed  early  during  the  year  1875.  It  is  true  this 
encumbered  the  society  with  an  indebtedness  of  $15,000, 
which,  owing  to  the  stringency  of  the  times,  entailed  innumer- 
able cares  and  responsibilities  upon  the  Institution,  to  over- 
come and  satisfy  which  demanded  no  small  amount  of  thought 
and  labor.  But  the  work  has  been  accomplished  with  God's 
assistance,  the  undertaking  not  only  holding  its  own,  but 
meanwhile  actually  advancing  in  prosperity  ;  so  that  to-day  it 
has  paid  off  nearly  all  of  its  debt,  besides  adding  numerous 
conveniences  and  improvements  to  the  Institute  building  and 
erecting  three  teachers'  residences.  The  total  expenses  of 
erection,  improvement,  maintenance  of  pupils,  salaries  of 
teachers,  matrons,  and  other  employees  have  been  and  are  de- 
frayed from  voluntary  contributions  and  gifts  bestowed  by 
members  of  the  Evangelical  Lutheran  Church  in  this  country  ; 
in  particular  by  those  of  the  aforesaid  Evangelical  Lutheran 
Synodal  Conference.  Thus  far  no  State  support  has  been 
received  and  none  is  asked  for. 

The  transfer  of  the  Institution  from  Royal  Oak  to  Norris, 
as  stated,  occurred  in  February,  1875,  the  Institution  then 
comprising  23  pupils,  together  with  the  director,  G.  Speck- 
hard,  and  family,  and  Mr.  H.  Uhlig,  who,  in  January,  1875, 
had  been  called  into  service  as  an  assistant  instructor  from 
the  Theological  Seminary  at  St.  Louis,  Missouri.  The  cere- 
mony of  dedication  took  place  on  the  following  17th  day  of 
May,  and  was  attended  by  a  large  concourse  of  friends  and 
patrons  from  Detroit  and  vicinity,  the  deaf  pupils  on  that  oc- 
casion giving  evidence  of  the  results  of  their  instruction  by 
speaking  orally  in  public.  Their  efforts  met  with  general  ap- 
probation. At  the  same  time  those  present  inspected  the  in- 
terior arrangements  of  the  Institution  building.  The  latter 
is,  exclusive  of  basement,  a  three-story  brick  structure,  46  x  74 
feet,  ornamented    with   a   belfry.     The  basement  comprises  a

cellar,  store-rooms,  a  bake  oven,  laundry  and  bath  rooms.  On 
the  first  floor  are  two  spacious  school-rooms,  a  dining  hall, 
which  serves  at  the  same  time  as  the  boys'  study,  a  kitchen, 
and  on  either  side  wash-rooms  for  the  children — the  one  for 
the  boys  being  on  the  east,  and  that  for  the  girls  on  the  west 


side  of  the  building.  On  the  second  floor  are  the  living-rooms 
of  the  matron  and  husband,  or  "Hauseltern  "  (the  so-called 
''  Institution  father  and  mother  "),  dormitories  for  the  girls, 
their  rooms  for  study  and  industrial  classes,  and  an  apartment 
for  the  sick.  On  the  third  floor  are  an  additional  school-room, 
dormitories  for  the  boys,  and  a  guest  chamber.  Fire-escapes 
are  provided  from  each  story.     All  of  the  apartments  have

high  ceihngs  and  are  bright  and  cheerful,  while  the  stairways 
and  halls  are  wide  and  convenient. 

Thus  arranged,  the  activity  of  the  Institution  increased  to 
such  an  extent  that,  within  the  year  1875,  another  instructor; 
Mr.  G.  Eitzman,  was  engaged.  This  gentleman,  however, 
after  serving  some  eighteen  months,  withdrew,  and  it  devolved 
again  upon  the  remaining  two  instructors,  Messrs.  Speckhard 
and  Uhlig,  to  divide  the  labor  of  the  school-work.  This  con- 
tinued until  November  20, 1879,  when  the  Institution  sustained 
a  most  severe  loss  in  the  sudden  demise  of  its  founder  and 
faithful  director,  the  Rev.  G.  Speckhard.  The  assis  tant  in- 
structor, H.  Uhlig,  who  had  been  specially  prepared  for 
the  arduous  duties  of  deaf-mute  training,  was  then  ap  pointed 
to  succeed  the  deceased  as  director,  which  position  he  has 
held  ever  since.  Messrs.  L.  Zeile  and  H.  Witte  were  then 
called  in  as  assistant  instructors,  and  in  place  of  Mrs.  Speck- 
hard, who,  with  her  deceased  husband,  had  supervised  the 
domestic  arrangements  of  the  Institution,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  F. 
Vogt  were  installed  as  Institution  father  and  mother — manager 
and  matron.  At  the  same  time,  they  assumed  charge  of  the 
farm  connected  with  the  Institution,  heretofore  conducted  by 
farm  hands.  Instructor  Witte,  however,  left  the  Institution 
in  the  year  1883,  and  Mr.  L.  Krause  took  his  place,  which  he 
continues  to  hold  at  the  present  time.  In  the  year  1885  Mr. 
Zeile  retired  and  Mr.  J.  G.  Etter  succeeded  him  as  instructor, 
but  also  withdrew  in  1892.  Meanwhile  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Vogt 
also  left,  and  Mr.  and  Mrs.  J.  Ketel  were  chosen  as  manager 
and  matron,  which  positions  they  now  hold. 

The  total  number  of  pupils  since  the  foundation  of  the  In- 
stitution amounts  to  183,  distributed  as  follows  :

8  The  German  Lutheran  Institution 

ks,  above  stated,  there  are  at  present  only  two  instructors, 
the  director,  H.  Uhlig,  and  Mr.  L.  Krause ;  a  third  will  be 
apjDointed  at  an  early  day. 

The  total  expenditure  for  maintenance  of  the  Insti- 
tution during  the  last  fiscal  year  aggregated...    $4,257  00 
The  total  receipts  during  the  same  period  were . .  .      4,717  00 
Of  this  latter  sum  the  parents  of  puj)ils  paid  on  ac- 
count of  board 1,310  31 

Board,  however,  is  only  paid  by  parents  able  to  do  so  ;  others 
are  exempt.  The  maximum  amount  charged  for  board  is  $10 
per  month.  This  sum,  however,  is  only  paid  by  very  few  ;  by 
far  the  greater  number  of  those  who  pay  do  so  according  to 
their  ability. 

The  total  valuation  of  the  property  of  the  Institution,  real 
and  personal,  is  estimated  to  be  $25,000. 

In  regard  to  the  school  proper,  and  more  especially  the  work 
of  instruction,  as  already  stated,  the  oral  method  in  the  Ger- 
man language  is  taught  and  used.  This  German  oral  method 
of  instruction  is  conducted  strictly  in  the  manner  and  accord- 
ing to  the  system  which  prevails  in  nearly  all  of  the  deaf-mute 
institutions  of  Germany,  which  is  designated  as  the  speech- 
method. 

The  first  thing  done  with  a  j)upil  upon  entry  is  to  have  him 
engage  in  breathing  exercises ;  that  is  to  say,  lung  gymnastics 
are  employed,  with  a  view  systematically  to  encourage  the 
emission  of  single  sounds,  the  teacher  slowly  emitting  sounds 
in  a  clear  and  natural  manner  and  encouraging  the  pupil  to 
imitate  them.  As  a  rule,  the  beginning  is  made  with  the  con- 
sonants h,  b,  d,  etc.  In  cases,  however,  where  the  pupil,  in 
repeating,  inclines  more  readily  to  give  vowel  sounds,  vowels 
themselves  are  at  first  substituted  for  consonants.  After  a  few 
hours  thus  devoted  to  practice  on  single  sounds,  several  of  the 
easier  sound  combinations  are  secured  and  determined,  and 
soon,  with  a  view  to  impart  greater  interest  and  eagerness,  sig- 
nificant sounds  and  word  combinations  present  themselves, 
which  are  readily  and  eagerly  comprehended  by  the  youthful 
beginners  in  speech.  As  accessories  in  attaining  this  end,  use 
is  made  of  a  collection  of  pictorial  mural  reading  charts  pre- 
pared and  published  by  the  director  of  the  school  at  Frankf  ort- 
on-the-Main,  Mr.  J.  Vatter.  In  this  way,  utilizing  these  by 
story  and  otherwise,  the  first  speech,  lip-reading,  and  instruc- 
tion in  writing  is  given.     It  follows,  of  course,  that  all  which 


The  German  Lutheran  Institution.  9 

the  pupil  has  thus  correctly  articulated  is  permanently  secured 
to  him  by  writing,  as  likewise  that  writing  from  the  very  first 
is  steadily  called  into  requisition  and  daily  practiced. 

The  acquisition  and  definite  determination  of  all  sounds  in 
connection  with  and  relation  to  significant  words,  with  scholars 
of  ordinary  capacity,  takes  from  six  to  eight  months— longer, 
however,  in  the  case  of  the  more  dull  and  intellectually  feeble. 
By  the  time  a  pupil  has  thoroughly  familiarized  himself  with 
the  contents  of  the  mural  charts,  he  has  also  advanced  suffi- 
ciently to  be  able  to  read  printed  matter,  and,  therefore,  now 
receives  his  first  reader,  entitled  "  Object  and  Language  In- 
struction." The  pupil  is  here  confronted  with  sentences,  and 
henceforth  is  taught  to  read  by  sentences,  and  so  to  speak  and 
think.  In  addition  to  this  reader,  in  which  grammar  receives 
systematic  consideration,  forms  of  speech  in  sentences,  such  as 
the  responses  to  queries  like  "  where,"  "  whereof,"  "  where- 
unto,"  "why,"  "wherefore,"  etc.,  are  specially  practised,  as 
also  are  all  manner  of  substitute  forms  of  speech,  the  language 
of  personal  intercourse,  and  of  whatever  transpires  in  the  daily 
routine  of  life.  Furthermore,  a  special  course  of  object  les- 
sons is  introduced  about  this  time,  as,  in  fact,  during  the  entire 
course  of  instruction,  by  observations  in  natura,  models,  and 
pictures.  At  this  time  also,  after  the  requisite  preliminary  ex- 
ercises in  numbers  have  been  had,  the  study  of  arithmetic  is 
commenced,  first  with  numbers  ranging  from  1  to  10,  then  1 
to  20,  and  later  1  to  100. 

It  requires  from  two  to  three  years  for  the  material  con- 
tained in  the  first  reader  to  be  thoroughly  mastered.  "When 
this  is  done,  the  pupil  receives  his  second  reader,  in  which  not 
only  grammar  is  introduced  in  its  more  extended  form,  but 
the  contents  generally  pay  due  attention  to  descriptive  and 
narrative  forms  of  speech.  The  special  exercises  in  the  forms 
of  speech  already  referred  to  are  continued,  as  also  are  all 
those  involving  the  more  difficult  vocal  and  consonant  combi- 
nations, for  the  latter  of  which  J.  Vatter  has  issued  special 
language  charts  as  a  basis.  At  this  stage  of  the  pupil's  prog- 
ress, and  even  earlier  at  times,  biblical  history  is  introduced, 
and  somewhat  later  religious  instruction  is  given.  This  is  at 
first  of  the  simplest  kind,  and  then  gradually  augmented. 
Geography,  more  especially  that  of  the  United  States,  is  also 
taught,  as  well  as  the  more  important  features  of  natural  and 
political  history.     Practice  in  arithmetic  now  embraces  the

four  ground  rules,  with  numbers  in  words  and  figures,  and  in 
some  cases  includes  simple  work  in  fractions.  On  the  part  of 
the  pupils,  brief  compositions  and  other  work  which  involves 
writing,  such  as  keeijing  a  diary,  letters,  etc.,  are  exacted,  in 
which  to  some  extent  they  have  already  had  some  practice. 
Likewise  drawing  and  ornamental  penmanship  have  meanwhile 
been  added  to  the  curriculum,  together  with  the  study  of  the 
English  language.  The  latter,  however,  is  confined  to  writing, 
as  the  repeated  efforts  made  have  shown  us  that  it  is  too  much 
and  too  difficult  for  deaf  children  to  learn  simultaneously 
equally  well,  orally,  two  different  languages  during  a  period 
of  only  six  years'  attendance  at  school,  which  frequently, 
alas  !  ignorant  parents  even  abbreviate. 

It  is  true  one  of  the  languages  suffers  to  the  extent  of  only 
being  learned  in  its  written  form,  whereas  the  other,  the  orally 
acquired  language,  also  suffers  somewhat.  We  must,  how- 
ever, accommodate  ourselves  to  circumstances  and  do  the  best 
we  can,  and  not  what  one  might  prefer  to  do  on  his  own  ac- 
count. 

This  applies  equally  to  the  matter  of  taking  children  into 
school  to  be  instructed  under  the  same  roof  regardless  of  their 
mental  capacity,  whether  gifted  or  of  feeble  intellect.  Owing 
to  the  fact  already  stated,  that  our  Institution  was  primarily 
founded  in  order  that  all  the  deaf  belonging  to  the  Lutheran 
Church  might  be  made  acquainted  with  the  Lutheran  faith  to 
the  extent  that  they  might,  in  later  years,  of  their  own  per- 
sonal volition,  become  members  of  their  mother  church,  it  is 
requisite  that  the  German  oral  language  shall  at  all  times  take 
precedence  in  our  speech  intercourse,  so  that  by  means  of  the 
same  our  scholars  may  finally,  on  leaving  school,  be  enabled 
to  be  confirmed  in  the  said  faith.  Therefore,  in  addition  to 
other  essentials,  it  becomes  incumbent  upon  us  that  at  all 
events  during  the  second  half  of  the  entire  school  term  special 
attention  be  given  to  the  matter  of  religious  instruction. 

In  addition  to  the  mental  labor  which  the  pupils  are  called 
upon  to  do  in  the  school  proper,  they  are  also  taught  to  do  suit- 
able work  out  of  school-hours.  The  girls  are  employed  in  the 
kitchen,  in  the  dining-room,  in  the  laundry,  in  the  sewing- 
room,  at  repairing,  etc.,  while  the  boys  are  put  to  work  in  the 
yards,  in  the  gardens,  and  upon  the  fields,  prepare  wood,  and 
perform  such  other  duties  upon  the  premises  as  are  helpful 
and  to  which  they  may  be  assigned. 


The  German  Lutheran  Institution.  11 

The  study  and  school  hours  daily  comprise  five  and  a  half 
hours,  and  the  annual  school  term  extends  from  September 
1st  to  July  15th.  In  addition  to  the  summer  vacation,  there 
are  holidays  of  eight  days  each  at  Christmas  and  Easter. 

The  age  of  admission  for  pupils  varies  from  eight  to  fifteen 
years ;  applicants  exceeding  that  age  are  only  taken  exception- 
ally. 

The  library  of  the  Institution  contains  some  four  hundred 
volumes  and  pamphlets,  together  with  a  collection  of  pictures, 
charts,  and  other  appliances  of  service  in  object-lessons. 

The  Evangelical  Lutheran  Synod  of  Missouri  and  other 
States  exercises  general  supervision  over  the  Institution, 
whereas  the  immediate  control  devolves  upon  a  board  of 
managers,  the  members  whereof  are  residents  of  Detroit, 
Michigan,  consisting  at  present  of  the  following-named  gentle- 
men :

The  St.  John's  Institute  for  Deaf- 

Mutes, 


ST.  FRANCIS,  WISCONSIN, 
1876-1893. 


By  Rev.  M.  M.  GEREND, 

President  of  Ihe  Iiistitule. 


THE  ST.  JOHN'S  INSTITUTE  FOE  DEAF-MUTES. 

St.  John's  Institute  is  located  at  St.  Francis,  near  Mil- 
waukee, Wis.  This  Institute  was  established  in  the  year  of  our 
Lord  1876,  by  the  Rev.  Theodore  Bruener,  and  formally  opened 
May  10,  1876,  the  opening-day  of  the  Centennial  Exposition  at 
Philadelphia.  The  building  now  occupied  by  the  deaf-mutes 
was  completed  in  the  summer  of  1879,  and  dedicated  in  the 


month  of  December  of  the  same  year.  It  is  a  solid  three-story 
structure,  of  cream-colored  brick  and  pleasing  style  of  archi- 
tecture ;  heated  by  a  furnace,  with  liberal  provision  for  ventila- 
tion. It  is  surrounded  by  ornamental  grounds,  woods,  and 
farming  lands,  and  well  adapted  for  the  care  of  the  unfortunates 
needing  its  protection.  The  Institute  will  now  comfortably 
accommodate  80  pupils,  and  is  maintained  by  contributions  and 
bequests  of  kind  friends  of  the  poor  deaf-mutes,  and  a  tuition 
fee,  which,  however,  is  so  low  that  it  is  within  the  reach  of 
nearly  every  one  in  need  of  the  advantages  offered  by  this 
humane  institution. 

This  being  a  diocesan  establishment,  deaf-mutes  of  the  arch- 
diocese of  Milwaukee  not  able  to  pay  even  this  small  tuition 
fee  will  be  admitted  on  presenting  a  certificate  testifying  to- 
their  poverty  and  promising  to  pay  all  they  can  under  existing 


4  The  St.  Johns  InMtute. 

circumstances.  This  certificate  must  be  signed  by  their  re- 
spective pastors. 

The  methods  of  work  embrace  quite  all  of  those  that  have 
proved  efficient  in  similar  institutions,  and  pupils  are  taught 
not  only  secular  branches,  but  also  instructed  in  the  truths  of 
holy  religion,  so  as  to  be  enabled  to  make  a  living  in  the  world 
and  at  the  same  time  attend  to  their  spiritual  welfare. 

Rev.  Father  Bruener,who  worked  for  the  Institute  with  untir- 
ing zeal,  was  called  to  a  new  field  of  labor  December  29, 1879, 
and  was  succeeded  by  Rev.  John  Friedl.     This  reverend  gen- 


KEV.  M.  31,   GEEEND. 


tleman,  who  had  charge  about  one  year,  was  succeeded  by  Eev. 
Charles  Fessler.  Father  Fessler  was  at  the  head  of  the  Insti- 
tute for  nine  years,  and  his  efforts  in  its  behalf  during  all  this 
time  were  unremitting. 

The  majority  of  the  inmates  being  the  children  of  poor  par- 
ents, and  donations  for  this  noble  cause  so  very  scarce,  it  seemed 
at  one  time  that  the  Institute  must  be  closed.  The  present 
rector  of  the  Catholic  Normal  School  and  Pio  None  CoUeo-e, 
Rev.  M.  M.  Gerend,  was  appointed  protector  of  St.  John's 
Institute  August  15,  1889,  by  the  Mt.  Rev.  M.  Heiss,  of  blessed

memory.  Father  Gerend,  in  order  to  place  the  Institute  on  a 
solid  basis  and  rid  it  for  all  time  to  come,  if  possible,  from 
financial  embarrassment,  requested  the  Mt.  Rev.  Archbishop  to 
approve  of  the  building  of  spacious  workshops  for  the  manu- 
facture of  church  furniture  (altars,  confessionals,  baptismal 
fonts,  stations,  statues,  pulpits,  and  all  kinds  of  cabinet  and 
carved  vi^ork  used  in  churches).  This  request  the  Archbishop 
cheerfully  granted,  assigning  even  for  this  purpose   shortly 


before  his  death  one  thousand  dollars  of  the  late  Father  Wis- 
bauer's  estate  left  to  him  for  charitable  distribution. 

The  shops  were  at  once  erected  (February,  1890),  and  well 
furnished  with  all  the  necessary  machinery,  and  at  present  the 
Institute  can  boast  of  having  the  best  plant  of  its  kind  in  the 
northwest.  Orders  come  in  from  every  side  and  $30,000 
worth  of  work  is  turned  out  annually.  The  Institute  resorted 
to  the  manufacture  of  church  furniture  for  two  reasons  :  In  the 


6  The  St.  Joh7\!s  [nstitution. 

first  place,  because  this  industry  combines  many  trades,  such 
as  carving,  cabinet-making,  carpentering,  painting,  decorating, 
gilding,  drawing,  designing,  etc.,  and  thus  gives  es'ery  pupil 
ample  opjiortunity  to  fit  himself  to  compete  with  his  fellow- 
man  in  making  an  honest  living  after  he  leaves  the  school ;  in 
the  second  place,  because  it  brings  to  the  Institute  a  class  of 
patrons  who  would  naturally  jjrefer  to  purchase  from  an  estab- 
lishment having  so  laudable  an  object. 

At  present  the  Institute  has  three  departments,  viz.,  school, 
industrial,  and  domestic. 

First.  The  School  Department,  in  which  pupUs  are  taught 
reading,  writing,  arithmetic,  geography,  catechism,  Bible  his- 
tory, etc.,  is  under  the  control  of  competent  teachers.  Prof. 
L.  W.  Mihm,  who  has  been  connected  with  the  Institute  for 
seventeen  years,  has  charge  of  the  boys,  and  Sisters  of  St.  Fran- 
cis instruct  the  girls. 

Second.  The  Industrial  Department,  where  boys  are  taught 
various  trades,  is  superintended  by  Mr.  E.  Brielmaier,  who  has 
established  a  reputation  as  an  architect  and  altar  builder 
throughout  the  northwest. 

Third.  The  Domestic  Department,  in  which  girls  perform 
the  usual  household  duties  and  learn  baking,  cooking,  sewing, 
needlework,  etc.,  is  under  the  supervision  of  Sisters. 

This  plan,  which  gives  time  for  study,  work,  and  recreation, 
develops  the  moral,  intellectual,  and  physical  nature  of  the 
inmates,  and  prepares  these  poor  unfortunate  beings, who  would 
otherwise  be  a  burden  to  the  community,  for  a  useful  life. 

The  results  accomplished  the  last  year  have  surpassed  even 
the  most  sanguine  expectations.  God  has  apparently  blessed 
the  undertaking. 

Adjoining  St.  John's  Institute  a  "  Memorial  Chapel "  has 
been  built  in  memory  of  the  late  Archbishop  of  Milwaukee, 
Mt.  Eev.  Michael  Heiss,  D.  D.,  the  earnest  friend  and  kind 
benefactor  of  these  unfortunates.

1877-1893.

Pyincipnl  of  the  School. 


THE  DEPARTMENT  FOR  THE  DEAF  OF  P.  KNAPP'S 
INSTITUTE. 

F.  Khapp's  Institute  was  founded  by  Prof.  Frederick  Knapp, 
of  Wiirtemberg,  a  graduate  of  the  Normal  College  at  Ess- 
lingen,  who  in  1850,  at  the  age  of  twenty-nine  years,  emigrated 
to  the  United  States  and  settled  in  Baltimore.  At  Esslingen 
Mr.  Knapp  attained  the  distinction  of  being  a  so-called  "star''

student,  equivalent  to  the  highest  rank  for  scholarship,  obli- 
gating him,  during  the  last  year  of  his  studies,  to  take  also  the 
special  course  instituted  to  qualify  graduates  for  the  instruc- 
tion of  the  deaf,  and  render  him  available  not  only  as  a  candi- 
date for  employment  in  an  ordinary  academic  school,  but  also 
qualified  as  a  teacher  of  the  deaf,  with  increased  emolument — 
a  feature  of  normal  instruction  prevalent  at  the  time  in  all  of 
the  better  class  of  normal  institutions  of  Germany. 

Mr.  Knapp's  Institute  was  opened  in  the  year  1853  as  a 
German  and  English  Academic  School,  with  76  i^upils  on  its 
roll.     It  rapidly  increased  in  j^opularity  until,  in  1876,  it  at- 


4  F.  Kiiapp's  Institute. 

tained  an  attendance  of  896  pupils,  with  a  corps  of  26  teachers, 
constituting  it  the  largest  purely  private  school  (conducted 
without  board  of  managers,  solely  by  the  principal)  in  the 
country.  Adding  German  to  the  curriculum  of  the  public 
schools  of  Baltimore  during  that  year  resulted  in  a  sudden 
decrease  of  attendance ;  this  continued  for  several  years,  until 
it  finally  remained  at  its  present  average  of  250  to  300  pupils. 

The  Institute  was  duly  authorized  to  confer  the  collegiate 
degrees  of  A.  B.  and  A.  M.,  and  its  graduates,  both  hearing 
and  deaf,  rank  among  the  foremost  citizens  of  the  country.  It 
has  educated  over  17,000  children  and,  among  them,  graduated 
not  less  than  100  deaf,  which  latter,  so  far  as  I  have  informa- 
tion, are  all  doing  well,  and  frequently,  in  letters  and  verbally, 
refer  with  grateful  feelings  to  their  Alma  Mater. 

In  1877  a  gentleman  of  Baltimore,  who  had  known  Prof. 
Knapp  abroad,  called  on  him  and  stated  that  he  had  a  con- 
genitally  deaf  little  daughter,  aged  ten  years,  whom  he  would 
like  Prof.  Knapp  to  "  teach  to  talk  "  as  they  did  in  Germany, 
knowing,  as  he  did,  that,  inasmuch  as  Prof.  Knapp  was  a  "  star  " 
graduate  of  the  Esslingen  College,  he  must  understand  the 
art  of  teaching  speech  to  the  deaf.  At  first  Prof.  Knapp, 
whose  school  then  had  upwards  of  600  pupils  on  its  rolls,  hesi- 
tated, but  was  finally  persuaded  to  trj'  the  experiment,  know- 
ing, as  he  said  at  the  time,  that  it  could  be  done,  but  it  was  a 
question  whether,  with  all  his  other  responsibilities  in  so  large 
a  school,  he  could  devote  sufficient  time  and  attention  to  make 
it  a  success.  He,  therefore,  took  the  child  into  his  school  con- 
ditionally. Very  soon  after,  another  German  parent,  Mr. 
Charles  Paulus,  having  a  deaf  child,  who  had  heard  of  the 
progress  Prof.  Knapp  was  making  with  his  little  deaf  pupil, 
called  and  pleaded  to  have  his  little  child  also  taught  speech  ; 
then  a  third  and  a  fourth  came  along,  until  a  small  class  was 
organized,  which  eventually  reached  fourteen  in  number,  and 
was  then,  so  far  as  it  related  to  the  acquisition  of  speech  and 
lip-reading,  constituted  a  distinct  and  separate  department,  on 
the  same  order  as  there  were  Hebrew,  French,  and  Music  De- 
partments. The  pupils  in  the  Deaf  Department  took  part,  at 
the  time,  in  all  of  the  regular  academic  classes  just  as  soon  as 
they  had  attained  sufficient  command  of  articulate  speech  and 
facility  in  reading  the  lips  to  enable  them  to  be  assigned  to 
their  respective  grades.  This  Deaf  Department  soon  became 
one  of  absorbing  interest  to  Prof.  Knapp,  until  he  eventually 


F.  Knapps  Iriditute.  5 

devoted  himself  to  it  exclusively.  His  evident  success  as  a 
teacher  of  articulate  speech  resulted  finally,  in  1880,  in  the 
drafting,  on  the  part  of  the  memorialists,  and  presentation  of 
the  following  Memorial  to  the  General  Assembly  of  Maryland, 
with  their  signatures  appended  : 

Mbmokial  to  the  General  Assembly  of  Makyland. 

To  the  Honorable  the  General  Assembly  now  in  Session  : 

Your  memorialists  beg  leave  respectfully  to  recall  your  attention  to  a 
subject  of  vital  import  to  a  class  of  deeply  afflicted  children  of  this  State, 
whose  painful  disabilities  appeal  most  strongly  to  your  sympathies  for 
pecuniary  aid,  viz  -. 

The  Indigent  Mutes. 

Prof.  F.  Knapp's  Institute  on  Holliday  street,  in  Baltimore,  Md.,  was 
founded  in  the  year  1853,  and  has  been  since  then  in  successful  operation. 
It  has  received  patronage  from  every  State  in  the  Union,  from  several 
Territories,  and  from  Germany,  France,  Demarara,  and  Brazil.  Its  yearly 
roster  has  at  times  numbered  as  many  as  800  pupils,  under  a  faculty  of 
twenty  teachers.  The  total  number  of  pupils  who  have  received  instruc- 
tion in  this  Institute  approximates  16,000. 

The  Institution  was  incorporated  with  power  to  confer  degrees  by  act 
of  legislature  in  1864.  The  principal  received  his  education  in  Esslingen, 
Germany,  and  after  graduation  he  was  assigned  to  duty  in  the  Deaf  and 
Dumb  School — his  efforts  in  this  connection  receiving  marked  approval. 
A  number  of  the  parents  of  mute  children,  aware  of  his  skill,  in  the  spring 
of  1877,  induced  him  to  form  a  class  for  their  especial  instruction.  This 
tuition  was  so  marked  in  its  good  effects  on  the  children  that  it  soon 
became  evident,  from  inquiry,  that  there  was  pressing  need  for  suitable 
provision  to  be  made  in  this  city  for  instruction  for  the  deaf  and  dumb 
in  articulation.  A  department  was  accordingly  incorporated  in  the  cur- 
riculum of  the  school  for  this  class  of  pupils.  At  the  expiration  of  the 
year  1879  there  were  18  pupils  instructed  by  the  principal  and  2  assistant 
teachers.  Provision  was  urgently  demanded  for  mutes  who&gt;e  parents  or 
friends  were  not  able  to  incur  the  expense  of  their  education,  many  of 
whom  would  not  send  their  children  of  tender  ages  from  home  among 
strangers,  even  if  they  had  the  means  of  doing  so,  which  fact  was  brought 
to  the  notice  of  the  legislature  of  1880. 

The  marked  feature  of  Prof.  Knapp's  system  of  instruction  is  that  he 
not  only  educates  mutes  in  all  the  departments  of  learning,  but  he 
literally  and  positively  teaches  the  dumb  to  speak.  His  pupils  hold  oral 
conversation  and  deliver  public  addresses  from  platforms,  as  your 
memorialists  can  testify  of  their  personal  knowledge  and  from  reliable 
testimony. 

Although,  strange  to  say,  but  little  was  known  of  Prof.  Knapp's 
instruction  of  mutes  until  within  the  last  few  years,  Knapp's  Institute  has 
for  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century  beeudoinga  grand  work  in  imparting 
English  instruction  to  German  children  and  others,   and  during  that 


6  F.  Knapji's  Institu.te. 

period,  notwithetauding  the  embarrassments  that  private  schools  have 
undergone,  he  has  neither  asked  for,  nor  received,  one  dollar's  aid  from 
either  city  or  State  until  the  year  1880,  when  the  legislature  made  an 
appropriation  for  the  education  of  twelve  indigent  mutes.  With  a  view 
of  giving  to  these  children  the  benefit  of  all  the  latest  discoveries  and 
appliances  for  mute  instruction,  and  of  making  such  full  return  to  the 
State  as  earnest  endeavors  would  secure,  during  the  past  summer^  Prof. 
Knapp,  at  his  own  expense,  and  with  certain  loss  to  himself  from  an 
absence  from  the  conduct  of  his  business,  visited  the  most  celebrated 
schools  for  mutes  in  Germany,  France,  and  Switzerland — in  all,  22  insti- 
tutes— closely  observing  their  methods  and  comparing  the  value  of  re- 
sults. "While  in  Germany  he  had  opportunity  to  compare  views  with  the 
delegates  from  that  country  who  had  recently  returned  from  the  Inter- 
national Congress  of  Mute  Instructors,  held  at  Milan,  Italy,  in  May,  1881, 
the  testimony  of  which  was  overwhelmingly  in  favor  of  the  system  of 
articulation  in  mute  instruction,  as  placed  on  record  by  formal  resolution 
and  adoption.  Of  all  the  minute  details,  appliances,  and  methods  of  this 
instruction.  Prof.  Knapp  fully  possessed  himself,  and  his  Institution  is 
now  conducted,  and  has  been,  on  the  plan  endorsed  and  approved  by  two 
hundred  of  the  most  prominent  and  learned  instructors  of  this  class  of 
youths.  The  pressure  upon  him  to  receive  into  his  Institution  other  in- 
digent mutes  than  those  founded  by  the  State  has  necessitated  the 
incurring  of  largely  increased  expenditures,  and  he  is  not  financially 
able,  nor  should  he  be  expected,  to  receive  and  educate  at  his  own  cost 
a  large  number  of  pupils  who  are  unable  to  pay.  It  is  in  behalf  of  these 
unfortunate  and  afflicted,  the  wards  of  the  State  for  the  past  two  years, 
for  whom  failure  on  your  part  to  make  proper  provisions  would  at  this 
point  of  their  education  be  an  act  of  unkindness — in  fact,  injustice — that 
your  petitioners  now  appeal  to  your  honorable  body,  and  most  respect- 
fully ask  that  Knapp's  Institute,  in  view  of  its  remarkable  success  in  the 
training  of  these  particular  children  and  others,  be  placed  on  the  list  of 
beneficiaries,  and  that  the  sum  of  fifteen  hundred  dollars  per  annum,  for 
the  next  two  years,  be  appropriated  to  enable  it  to  continue  to  give 
speech,  education,  enlightenment,  and  power  of  usefulness  to  indigent 
mutes,  under  such  regulation  as  your  honorable  body  may  deem  right 
and  proper,  and  your  petitioners,  as  in  duty  bound,  will  ever  pray.

With  a  view  to  give  some  practical  illustration  to  the  mem- 
bers of  the  Maryland  legislature,  Prof.  Knapp  was  prevailed 
upon  by  his  friends  to  take  all  of  the  children  comprising  the 
Deaf  Department  of  his  Institute  (some  twentj'-fivein  number) 
to  Annapolis,  a  special  car  having  been  generously  provided 
by  the  president  of  the  Baltimore  &amp;  Ohio  Railroad,  an  account 
of  which  appeared  in  the  journals  of  the  day,  as  follows  : 

[Annapolis  corresponclence  of  tlie  Baltimore  American,  Thursday,  Marcli  11,  1880.] 

Education  oe  the  Deaf  and  Dumb. 
Professor  Knapp  was  here  to-day,  with  eighteen  pupils  of  his  Deaf  and 
Dumb  Institute,  on  North  Holliday  street,  Baltimore,  for  the  purpose  of 


8  F.  Kuapp's  Institute. 

exhibiting  to  the  members  the  proficiency  attained  by  them  in  the  art  of 
speaking,  reading,  and  writing  under  his  instruction,  an  appropriation  of 
f  1,200  a  year  being  asked  for  the  support  of  the  Institution.  The  pupils 
appeared  first  before  the  Committee  on  Ways  and  Means,  and,  afterwards, 
before  the  Governor,  and  gave  exhibitions  of  their  skill.  On  motion  of 
Mr.  McClure,  the  use  of  the  hall  of  the  House  of  Delegates  was  given 
to  Professor  Knappand  his  pupils.  The  exhibition  was  largely  attended, 
and  the  members  were  highly  pleased  with  it.  The  manner  in  which  the 
deaf  and  dumbpupils  were  taught  to  speak,  repeat  and  answer  questions, 
read  and  write,  was  regarded  as  remarkable.  Professor  Knapp  has  ap- 
plied to  the  legislature  for  an  appropriation  of  *  1,200  a  year  to  carry  on 
the  Deaf  and  Dumb  Institution,  and  the  impression  made  to-day  was 
very  favorable. 


[The  Morning  Herald,  Ihnrsday,  March  11,  1880.] 
The  most  interesting  delegation  that  has  been  here  this  session  arrived 
this  morning.  Led  by  Professor  Knapp  and  accompanied  by  several 
assistant  teachers,  eighteen  deaf  and  dumb  children,  boys  and  girls, 
entered  the  State  House,  attracting  a  curious  crowd  as  the  mutes  marched 
in  regular  order  toward  the  room  of  the  Committee  of  Ways  and  Means. 
Professor  Knapp  has  eighteen  deaf  and  dumb  pupils  attending  his  Insti- 
tute, and  there  are  four  others  who  wish  to  attend  but  are  too  poor. 
Recognizing  the  great  good  h-)  is  doing  the  State  by  caring  for  and 
teaching  these  worse  than  helpless  children,  he  asks  the  legislature  to 
mate  an  annual  appropriation  of  4jl,200  to  be  used  solely  for  this  pur- 
pose, which  will  thus  euable  him  to  teach  each  child  at  a  nominal  sum. 
"When  the  little  ones  filed  in  the  room  this  morning,  the  Professor  stood 
ojiposite  them,  and  by  motion  of  his  mouth  asked  them  all  sorts  of 
questions,  the  answers  to  which  were  comparatively  clear  and  distinct. 
They  are  taught  altogether  by  facial  expression,  movements  of  the 
mouth,  and  pictorial  illustrations.  One  or  two  little  fellows,  hardly  tall 
enough  to  see  over  the  top  of  the  table,  gave  their  answers  with  such 
readiness  that  the  looker.s-on  were  astonished,  and  well  they  might  be. 
The  most  advanced  pupil  in  the  class  is  Miss  Henrietta  Hecht,  a  bright 
and  pretty  little  miss  of  fourteen  years. 

Mr.  Chapman,  chairman  of  the  Committee  of  Ways  and  Means,  and 
Mr.  Boberts,  of  Prince  George,  who  interrogated  the  little  ones,  seemed 
well  pleased  with  their  efforts.  Later,  accompanied  by  Mr.  Emerich,  the 
little  delegation  called  on  the  Governor,  who,  in  his  hearty  way,  bade 
them  welcome.  Later  still,  the  hall  of  the  House  of  Delegates,  after 
adjournment,  was  given  up  to  them,  and  they  were  again  questioned, 
their  replies  creating  a  great  deal  of  amusement  and  sympathy.  Miss 
Hecht  informed  the  assembled  gentlemen  that  she  was  very  much  pleased 
with  Governor  Hamilton,  and  thought  him  a  pleasant  and  agreeable 
gentleman.  Mrs.  Koberts,  wife  of  Mr.  Joseph  K.  Roberts,  and  several 
other  ladies  who  were  present,  talked  with  the  little  ones. 

As  above  stated,  all  of  the  deaf  children  were  taken,  even 
such  as  had  been  in  school  but  tv?o  days  and  had  not  yet  learned 


F.  Knapp's  InstitMte.  9 

to  articulate,  as  Prof.  Knapp  desired  to  show  to  members  of 
the  legislature  clearly  the  character  of  instruction  given  at  dif- 
ferent stages  of  progress,  and  have  them  judge  of  the  result 
themselves.  The  committee-room  where  he  was  to  exhibit  his 
class  proved  too  small  for  all  who  desired  to  witness  the  exhi- 
bition, whereupon  the  legislature  took  a  recess  at  noon  ,and 
accorded  to  him  the  use  of  the  Assembly  hall,  where  he  impro- 
vised a  school-room,  and  for  two  hours  illustrated,  by  actual 
practice  with  the  pupils  of  different  grades,  his  system  of  teach- 
ing speech  and  reading  of  the  lips,  commencing  with  children 
who  could  not  articulate  at  all,  then  with  those  who  could 
articulate  and  read  from  the  lips  "Papa."  "Mamma,"  then  those 
who  could  speak  and  read  short  sentences,  and  so  on  until 
finally  he  told  one  of  the  pupils  in  his  own  words  to  "  thank 
the  gentlemen  for  the  use  of  their  hall,  telling  them  that  you 
have  been  treated  very  kindly,  but  were  now  very  hungry  and 
wanted  your  dinner,"  all  of  which  the  pupil  did  orally,  with 
perfect  distinctness,  to  the  great  delight  of  the  large  audience 
present.  The  exhibit  proved  so  satisfactory  to  the  Committee 
of  Ways  and  Means  that  the  appropriation  asked  for  by  the 
memorialists  was  granted  on  the  same  day,  although  Prof. 
Knapp  himself  had  not  asked  for  or  received  any  recognition 
of  the  kind  before.  Since  then  this  annual  stipend  towards 
the  support  of  the  Deaf  Department  of  Prof.  Knapp's  Institute 
has  been  continued  unintermittedly  up  to  the  present  time. 
This  by  no  means  covered  the  expenses  of  the  Deaf  Depart- 
ment, as  the  number  of  non-paying  pupils  taught  was  always 
in  excess  of  the  twelve  for  whom  allowance  was  made  by  the 
legislature — this  excess  amounting  to  as  many  as  nine  pupils 
in  one  year,  exclusive  of  pay  pupils. 

As  a  matter  of  history,  I  here  append  letters  from  the  Mayor 
of  the  city  of  Baltimore  and  from  the  State  Superintendent  of 
Public  Instruction,  showing  the  estimates,  at  the  time,  put  by 
these  officials  upon  the  Deaf  Department  of  Prof.  Knapp's  In- 
stitute :

,  Deab  Sib  :  I  am  very  desirous  of  getting  a  just  estimate  of  the  value 
of  the  Deaf-Mute  Department  in  Mr.  P.  Knapp's  Institute  on  Holliday 
street.  I  have  visited  the  In.'ititute,  and  Mr.  K.  has  explained  his  theory  to 
me.  But  the  school  was  not,  and  is  not  now,  in  operation,  so  that  I  did 
not  see  what  it  is  so  needful  I  shall  see,  viz.,  practice.  He  referred  me 
to  you,  sir,  however,  as  one  who  has  visited  his  school  and  witnessed  his

method  in  practice.     May  I   ask  your  candid   opinion  upon  what  you 
saw  ?     How  does  his  scliool  stand  in  public  opinion  ? 

Your  opinion  will  decide  the  character  of  my  answer  to  a  Virginian 
mother  who  has  written  to  me  to  inquire  about  the  school. 

Hoping  you  will  pardon  the  liberty,  and,  if  convenient,  give  me  an 
answer  to-morrow, 

I  remain,  very  respectfully,  yours,

Kev.  David  Baee. 
Deae  Sie  :  I  have  received  yours  of  August  27th. 

I  have  on  several  occasions  visited  Mr.  Knapp's  school  for  the  instruc- 
tion of  deaf-mutes,  and  have  been  much  surprised  at  the  results  produced. 
I  have  seen  children,  born  deaf  and  dumb  (at  least,  so  I  am  informed),  who 
could  both  speak  and  understand  when  spoken  to,  learning  truly  to 
translate  the  motion  of  the  lips.  I  have  myself  full  confidence  in  the 
success  of  his  method,  and  would  unhesitatingly  send  a  child  so  afflicted, 
if  under  my  control,  to  his  school.  Although  I  had  often  heard  of  this 
method  of  instruction  for  the  deaf  and  dumb,  I  had  little  faith  in  it 
until  I  saw  the  practical  results  at  Professor  Knapp's  school. 

I  think  that  if  you  could  see  what  he  has  accomplished  for  his  pupils 
you  would  agree  with  me  in  recommending  a  trial  of  his  system. 
I  am,  very  truly,

Prof.  F.  Knapp. 

Deak  Sie  :  My  visit  to  the  Institute  under  your  charge,  last  fall,  gave 
me  unexpected  pleasure.  I  was  especially  interested  in  the  education  of 
the  deaf-mutes,  and  I  sincerely  congratulate  you  on  the  success  you  have 
obtained  in  teaching  them  to  speak.  The  methods  which  you  pursue 
are  not  only  philosophical,'  but  experience  has  proved  them  to  be  also 
practical  and  successful. 

I  have  the  honor  to  be,  your  obedient  servant, 

M.  A.  NEWELL, 
Superintendent  of  Public  Instruction. 

The  instruction  of  the  deaf  was  a  matter  of  paramount  inter- 
est to  Prof.  Knapp.  No  applicant  was  ever  known  to  have 
been  turned  away  by  him,  no  matter  how  unpromising ; 
neither  have  any  pupils,  to  my  knowledge,  ever  been  discharged 
on  account  of  dullness  or  inability  to  acquire  speech.  Prof. 
Knapp  contended  that  there  was  no  credit  in  teaching  a  bright 


F.  Knapp's  Institute.  11 

child — anybody  could  do  that ;  he  would  test  the  ability  and 
qualifications  of  teachers  by  giving  them  some  of  his  deaf  chil- 
dren to  instruct.  A  teacher  who  applied  to  him  for  employ- 
ment in  the  academic  department  was  asked  for  his  creden- 
tials. Upon  exhibiting  them,  Prof.  Knapp  at  once  said,  "  Why, 
look  here,  if  you  were  a  '  star '  pupil  at  Esslingen,  as  your 
diploma  states,  you  must  have  also  taught  in  the  deaf  class 
attached  to  the  College.  When  I  was  there  the  good  pupils 
were  assigned  to  that  department ;  did  you  not  also  teach 
there?"  The  applicant  replied,  "I  had  to."  Prof.  Knapp 
then  said,  "  Don't  you  think  it  would  be  well  for  you  to  try 
and  teach  the  deaf  and  dumb  here  %  I  do  not  need  a  teacher 
for  any  other  department  than  that  of  the  deaf.  If  you  care 
to  go  to  work  in  my  deaf  department,  I  will  give  you  a  trial." 
The  trial  proved  entirely  successful  and  the  man  was  engaged. 
Prof.  Knapp,  upon  principle,  treated  those  of  his  pupils 
who  entered  the  Deaf  Department  upon  perfect  equality  with 
the  hearing  pupils  of  his  Institute.  He  would  treat  a  deaf 
child  very  much  upon  the  order  he  might  have  treated  a  pupil 
just  arrived  from  Spain,  who  could  speak  neither  German  nor 
English.  He  would  first  have  to  be  taught  to  speak  and  un- 
derstand English  or  German.  Deaf  children,  therefore,  upon 
entering  his  Institute,  were  assigned  to  special  teachers  in 
articulation  and  lip-reading  until  sufficiently  qualified  to  enter 
one  or  another  of  the  hearing  classes.  When  not  in  their 
articulation  class-room,  seats  would  be  assigned  to  them  be- 
tween and  among  hearing  pupils.  In  the  play-room  at  recess, 
or,  if  boarders,  after  school  and  at  meals,  they  would  freely 
intermingle  with  their  hearing  associates.  In  penmanship, 
drawing,  and  even  other  studies,  they  could  at  once  enter 
classes  according  to  their  age  or  ability.  Prof.  Knapp  con- 
tended, from  the  very  beginning,  that  as  soon  as  a  deaf  child 
was  able  to  go  into  a  hearing  class  of  any  kind,  he  should  be 
put  there ;  he  contended  that  the  more  the  deaf  commingled 
with  the  hearing,  the  less  would  they  notice  their  defect.  And, 
to  attain  this  feeling  of  freedom  from  the  thought  of  being 
afilicted,  hearing  children  in  the  Institute  were  never  allowed 
to  "motion  "  to  any  deaf  child  when  they  wanted  anything  or 
desired  to  direct  his  attention  to  any  object.  If  hearing 
children  were  found  doing  so,  they  were  at  once  sent  from  the 
room,  and  admonished  by  being  told,  "  You  can't  read  the 
lips,  but  that  child  can ;  speak  to  him,  therefore."     Hence, 


12  F.  Knapp's  Institute. 

hearing  children,  as  a  rule,  never  think  of  using  gestures  to 
our  deaf  children  ;  on  the  contrary,  they  constantly  speak  to 
them  just  the  same  as  they  do  to  their  hearing  associates. 
Our  deaf  children  use  neither  gestures  nor  manual  alphabet. 
Prof.  Knapp  never  permitted  such  a  thing.  If  at  any  time  a 
child,  either  hearing  or  deaf,  v?as  discovered  making  signs  or 
using  the  manual  alphabet,  he  would  put  gloves  on  that  child's 
hands,  and  children  always  dreaded  wearing  gloves,  it  being 
an  evidence  of  stupidity  and  punishment.  It  is  something 
that  seldom  occurs  now,  as  the  older  children  avoid  doing  so 
from  both  habit  and  principle,  knowing  it  to  be  wrong. 

One  of  the  peculiarities  of  the  mode  of  teaching  in  Prof. 
Knapp's  Institute  is  the  custom  he  devised  of  finding  some 
excuse  for  a  recess  whenever  he  observed  the  attention  of  his 
pupils  to  be  lagging.  Whenever  he  went  into  a  class-room  to 
conduct  an  examination,  he  invariably  commenced  at  the  foot 
of  the  class,  rarely  questioning  the  brighter  pupils  at  the  head. 
He  employed,  at  times,  quite  original  means  to  attain  given  re- 
sults in  a  class.  Thus,  whenever  he  taught  fractions  in  a  deaf 
class,  he  would  use  either  apples  or  oranges,  dividing  them  into 
halves,  quarters,  and  sixteenths.  The  same  would  be  done  in 
the  subtraction  of  fractions,  and  the  eating  of  the  orange  or  its 
fractional  parts  was  always  made  conditional  upon  correct 
answers. 

If  he  desired  to  inculcate  punctuality,  for  instance,  he  would 
entrust  his  watch-key  to  the  delinquent  and  require  him  to  be 
punctually  on  hand  with  it  at  the  hour  of  opening  the  school, 
in  order  that  he  might  wind  up  his  watch,  which  generally  had 
the  desired  effect.  To  prevent  any  thought  of  being  a  subject 
of  charity  arising  in  a  child's  mind,  he  would,  when  such  a 
child  needed,  for  instance,  a  suit  of  clothing,  institute  some- 
thing of  rivalry  for  a  prize,  taking  care  that  the  child  in  need 
should  prove  the  winner.  He  would  then  probably  say  to  the 
child,  ''What  is  it  you  want — a  watch?  Oh,  no;  you  don't 
want  a  watch  merely — you  want  a  suit  of  clothes  with  a  watch 
thrown  in,"  and  in  this  way  the  child  would  not  be  made  to  feel 
that  he  was  getting  the  clothes  as  a  matter  of  charity.  He 
was  called  by  all  pupils,  young  and  old,  simply  "  Papa  Knapp." 

Finally,  he  contended  that  there  should  never  be  more  than 
thirty  deaf  in  any  school  where  the  deaf  were  taught.  He 
would  multiply  small  schools  rather  than  encourage  the  aggre- 
gation of  the  deaf  in  large  institutions.     He  would  have  the 


F.  Knapp's  Institute.  13 

deaf  live  among  and  be  with  hearing  people  in  families,  in  busi- 
ness, at  recreations,  and  not  congregate  solely  among  them- 
selves ;  the  latter,  he  contended,  converted  them  into  a  distinct 
class  of  afflicted  and  defectives,  whereas,  if  they  learned  to 
speak  and  read  the  lips,  and  associated  with  the  hearing,  their 
defect  would  not  be  anything  like  as  apparent  or  detrimental 
to  their  obtaining  employment  and  enjoying  the  fullness  of 
life,  it  being  a  notable  fact  that  the  early  association  of  the 
deaf  with  the  hearing,  and  their  ability  to  speak  with  and  un- 
derstand the  latter,  gave  rise  to  friendships  in  later  life  which 
proved  an  important  factor  in  securing  desirable  positions. 

Prof.  Knapp's'Institute,  at  the  time  of  his  decease,  January 
7,  1893,  had  268  pupils  upon  its  rolls,  including  24  deaf  chil- 
dren. These  latter  are  preliminarily  taught  articulation  and 
lip-reading  by  the  son  (Wm.  A.  Knapp)  and  daughter  (Bertha 
A.  Knapp)  of  the  late  Prof.  Knapp,  his  successors  in  charge 
of  the  Institute,  assisted  by  the  following  teachers  :  Miss  Agnes 
Lacey  and  Miss  Elvina  S.  Kapp.

THE  McCOWEN  OEAL  SCHOOL  FOR  YOUNG  DEAF 
CHILDREN. 

HiSTOBiOAL  Statement. 

The  McCowen  Oral  School  for  Young  Deaf  Children  was 
established  in  Chicago  in  1883,  under  the  name  of  "  The  Voice 
and  Hearing  School  for  the  Deaf,"  its  first  location  being  at 
No.  3363  Indiana  avenue. 

The  principal.  Miss  Mary  McCowen,  was  formerly  a  teacher  in 
the  Nebraska  State  Institute  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb  at  Omaha, 
where  she  acquired  the  sign-language  and  used  it  in  the  class- 
room. Led  by  previous  long  experience  in  the  public 
schools  to  believe  that  better  results  ought  in  some  way  to  be 
obtained  for  the  deaf,  Miss  McCowen  made  a  thorough  study 
of  the  history  of  deaf-mute  instruction  and  of  the  methods  then 
employed,  and  began  giving  her  leisure  time  to  experiments  in 
different  directions.  During  the  school  year  of  1881-'2  a  num- 
ber of  audiphones  were  presented  to  the  Institution,  and  the 
superintendent,  knowing  of  Miss  McCowen's  experiments, 
asked  her  to  make  use  of  them,  and  afforded  her  every  facility 
for  making  a  thorough  test  and  experiment  as  to  the  possibili- 
ties of  developing  latent  hearing  by  this  means. 

Experiments  in  Developing  Latent  Hearing. 

The  results  of  these  continued  experiments  were  so  satisfac- 
tory that  in  September,  1882,  the  beginning  class  in  the  Insti- 
tution, numbering  about  twenty,  was,  at  her  request,  assigned 
to  her  for  oral  and  aural  training — the  first  instance,  so  far  as 
known,  where  a  class  of  deaf  pupils  were  taught  exclusively 
by  the  auricular  method  or  the  persistent  use  of  latent  hear- 
ing, which  latent  hearing  has  since  been  proved  by  tests  in 
numerous  institutions  of  this  country  to  exist  in  not  less  than 
ten  per  cent,  of  their  pupils. 

During  the  latter  part  of  the  year  the  use  of  the  audiphones 
was  almost  wholly  discontinued,  from  the  fact  that  the  pupils 
had  discovered  that  without  the  audiphones  they  could  really 
hear,  and  were  happy  to  be  relieved  of  the  necessity  of  hold- 
ing the  instrument  in  position,  which  was  necessarily  weari- 
some and  had  become  irksome  to  them. 


The  McCowen  Oral  School.  5 

The  results  of  this  year  far  surpassed  all  expectation,  and 
believing  that  if  such  improvement  in  voice  and  language 
could  be  obtained  where  the  pupils  used  the  sign-language 
exclusively,  except  during  the  few  hours  in  the  class-room, 
much  more  might  justly  be  expected  where  pupils  were  sur- 
rounded entirely  by  speaking  people.  Miss  McCowen  severed 
her  connection  with  the  Nebraska  Institution,  and  in  October, 
1883,  opened  in  Chicago  her  private  home  School. 

Peivate  School. 

Although  the  School  was  originally  intended  for  the  educa- 
tion of  that  class  of  the  deaf  having  hearing  susceptible  of 
training,  the  totally  deaf  were  not  refused  admission,  and  after 
a  time  they  formed,  as  they  still  do,  a  large  proportion  of  the 
most  successful  pupils  of  the  School,  lacking  only  in  that  more 
perfect  modulation  of  the  voice  which  even  a  slight  degree  of 
hearing  makes  possible. 

EaELY  EnUCATION  FOE  THE  DeAF. 

Convinced  that  one  cause  for  the  comparatively  meagre  re- 
sults in  many  institutions  was  the  fact  that  pupils  were  not 
admitted  until  the  most  impressionable  years  were  past,  this 
School, /"roni  the  first,  gave  special  prominence  to  the  necessity 
for  earlier  education  for  the  deaf,  and  in  its  first  circulars  an- 
nounced that  pupils  would  be  received  at  the  age  of  five  years. 
A  few  months'  experience,  however,  made  it  evident  that  even 
this  involved  too  great  a  loss  of  time,  and  soon  a  pupil  was 
received  at  the  age  of  four,  and  then  one  at  three,  since  which 
time  the  very  early  education  of  the  deaf  has  been  advocated 
and  the  Infant  Kindergarten  Department  has  been  a  special 
feature  of  the  School,  in  harmonious  relations  with  the  more 
advanced  classes,  thus  forming  the  ideal  home  school. 

Eapid  Geowth. 

Within  six  months  the  School  outgrew  its  first  quarters  on 
Indiana  avenue  and  was  removed  to  63d  and  Wabash  avenue, 
into  a  large  residence  with  spacious  and  attractive  grounds, 
thus  securing  necessary  room  for  outdoor  recreation.  As 
time  went  on,  the  increase  in  numbers  justified  the  increase  in 
school-room  facilities,  and  to  the  latest  and  best  apparatus  of 
every  kind  were  added,  for  the  more  advanced  pupils,  a  shop 
for  wood-carving,  a  regular  font  of  type,  and  also  a  type- 
writer. 


The  McCowen  Oral  School.  7 

Later  this  property  was  purchased,  and  in  1888  it  was  thor- 
oughly remodelled  and  refitted,  and  more  roomy  quarters  were 
provided  for  the  increasing  Kindergarten  department. 

Destroyed  by  Fire. 

In  February  of  the  following  year,  during  the  temporary 
absence  in  the  city  of  the  principal,  the  building  and  contents 
were  totally  destroyed  by  fire,  although,  fortunately,  without 
accident  or  injury  to  any  of  the  family.  Eeturning  in  the 
evening,  only  smoking  ruins  were  found.  Before  bed-time, 
however,  a  house  had  been  rented,  partially  furnished,  and 
provisioned.  Thanks  to  the  neighbors  and  friends,  who 
brought  in  supplementary  supplies  of  all  kinds,  for  temporary 
use,  the  children  retired  comfortable  in  their  new  home,  and 
the  next  day  school  work  was  resumed. 

This  place,  though  the  grounds  were  spacious  and  the 
house  ample  for  living  apartments,  lacked  class-room  accom- 
modation, and,  permission  being  obtained,  a  school-house  with 
three  class-rooms  and  a  gymnasium  was  at  once  erected  on 
the  grounds.  These  quarters  at  6027  Indiana  avenue  were 
occupied  until  May,  1890,  when  the  School  was  transferred  to 
its  present  location,  6550  Yale  avenue,  which  property,  in  the 
meantime,  had  been  pui'chased  and  remodelled'  for  its  occu- 
pancy. 

Incorporation. 

In  November,  1890,  the  School  was  incorporated  under  the 
name  of  "  The  McCowen  Oral  School  for  Young  Deaf 
Children,"  with  the  following  gentlemen  as  board  of  trustees  : 

John  W.  Steeeteb,  M.  D.,         .         .         .         .         Fresident. 

Sidney  O.  Blair,  ......     Secretary. 

John  C.  Black,         ......  Treasurer. 

A.  C.  Baetlett. 
O.  S.  A.  Spragtte. 
Joy  Morton. 
W.  S.  Henderson. 

They  assumed  the  financial  control  of  the  School,  leaving- 
Miss  McCowen  entirely  free  to  carry  out  her  advanced  ideas 
with  regard  to  the  age  of  admission  of  pupils,  and,  as  before, 
in  full  control  and  management  of  the  School.  A  large  neigh- 
boring house  was  soon  rented  for  the  better  accommodation 
of  the  family. 


The  McCowen  Oral  School.  9 

In  the  summer  of  1892  the  ten-room  house  next  adjoining 
the  School  on  the  north  was  purchased,  and  serves  as  dormi- 
tories for  the  girls.  A  building  for  school-rooms  and  gym- 
nasium was  also  erected  between  the  two,  immediately  in  the 
rear,  a  covered  walk  on  the  second  floor  connecting  it  with 
both.  In  the  original  building,  an  eighteen-room  house,  are 
the  office,  reception-room,  family  parlor,  dining-rooms,  kitchen, 
and  the  dormitories  for  the  boys. 

The  expenses  of  the  School  are  met  by  tuition  fees,  sup- 
plemented by  donations,  there  still  being  no  permanent  endow- 
ment. 

The  School  has,  from  the  first,  published  a  monthly  paper, 
called  7%e  New  Method,  which  is,  so  far  as  we  know,  the  only 
one  published  by  an  oral  school. 

Childeen  Continually  in  the  Care  or  Teachers. 

The  home-life  of  the  pupils  is  made  to  conform  as  nearly 
as  possible  to  that  of  the  best  family  home,  they  being  en- 
couraged by  their  teachers  to  have  a  knowledge  of  and  an 
interest  in  all  the  details  of  home-life,  each  being  taught  to 
yield  his  special  preferences,  when  necessary,  to  the  best  in- 
terests of  all.  The  older  are  interested  in  the  younger,  and 
the  little  ones,  in  turn,  learn  many  things  from  them  more 
naturally  and  more  rapidly  than  if  associated  only  with  grown 
persons.  The  regular  lessons  are  conducted  in  the  school- 
rooms at  regular  school-hours ;  the  education  of  the  child, 
however,  begins  when  he  rises  in  the  morning,  and  ends  only 
when  he  falls  asleep  at  night.  While  dressing  and  undressing 
he  is  taught,  not  laboriously  but  gradually,  by  daily  repetition, 
the  names  of  the  different  articles  of  clothing  and  the  language 
expressing  the  different  actions  involved,  as  "Button  my  shoe," 
"  Unbutton  my  apron,"  "  Put  on,"  "  Take  off,  "  Comb  my 
hair,"  etc.  In  the  bath-room,  as  they  gather  regularly  after 
each  meal  with  a  teacher,  they  are  taught  the  names  and  lan- 
guage pertaining  thereto,  as  water,  soap,  wash,  wipe,  sponge, 
towel,  toothbrush,  etc. 

In  the  dining-room  the  classes  of  children,  with  their  teachers, 
sit  at  separate  tables.  A  grace  suitable  to  the  comprehension 
of  each  class  is  written  on  the  black-board  ajid  read  in  concert ; 
a  few  simple  words  for  the  youngest,  and  for  the  older  pupils 
such  forms  as  are  in  use  in  Christian  families.     While  the  food 


The  McCowen  Oral  School.  11 

is  being  served,  and  during  the  progress  of  the  meal,  the  chil- 
dren are  taaght  the  names  of  the  different  articles  of  food  and 
of  table  and  dining-room  service,  and  from  the  first  are  ex- 
pected to  ask  by  word  of  mouth  for  what  they  want.  At  first 
the  attempt  to  speak  the  name  is  accepted,  as  "  Bread  "  ;  as  this 
by  repetition  becomes  more  and  more  distinct  the  complete 
sentence  is  required,  as  "  I  want  bread "  ;  later,  one  after 
another,  all  the  polite  forms  of  table  talk  are  taught  and  prac- 
tised until  they  become  habitual.  Older  classes  engage  in 
conversation  with  the  teacher  on  the  current  topics  of  the 
day. 

During  play-hours,  as  well  as  in  the  class-room,  the  children 
are  continually  in  the  care  of  the  teacher,  who  participates  in 
their  games  and  recreations,  and  forestalls  mischief  by  prop- 
erly directing  their  energies.  This  affords  the  best  possible 
opportunity  for  studying  the  individual  characteristics  of  each 
child,  thus  rendering  it  possible  to  adapt  the  instruction  of 
the  class-room  to  his  real  capabilities.  Another  advantage  of 
this  constant  presence  of  a  teacher  is  that  the  chUd  struggling 
to  express  a  thought  is  given  at  once  the  proper  word,  and 
thus  unconsciously  forms  the  habit  of  trying  to  express  him- 
self in  words  rather  than  in  motions,  which  he  must  otherwise 
inevitably  do ;  and  being  continually  addressed  in  connected 
language  he  naturally  acquires  facility  in  lip-reading,  which 
he  does  in  advance  of  his  ability  to  put  his  own  thought  into 
speech,  just  as  a  hearing  babe  understands  what  is  said  to 
him  long  before  he  is  able  to  make  any  response  in  words. 

Hand-Woek. 

The  art  department  comprises  instruction  in  pencil  and 
charcoal- drawing,  sketching  from  life  and  nature,  designing, 
painting  in  water  colors,  and  clay-modelling  ;  a  lesson  in  one 
of  these  being  given  daily  to  all,  even  the  youngest.  The 
babies,  however,  have  their  work  for  some  time  at  the  black- 
board, charcoal  and  the  pencil  only  being  introduced  after 
they  have  acquired  considerable  ease  in  holding  the  chalk,  and 
a  good  free  movement. 

We  consider  the  small  hand-slate,  as  generally  used  in 
schools,  the  greatest  enemy  to  good  hand-work,  and  banish  it 
from  our  premises. 

Our  Art  room  is  in  every  sense  a  "  study  "  room,  the  ability 
to  represent  the  object  presented  by  the  teacher  accurately 


The  McCowen  Oral  School.  13 

and  with  dispatch  being  considered  of  more  importance  than 
the  making  of  beautiful  "pictures." 

The  results  of  these  careful  lessons  are  visible  on  the  black- 
boards of  every  school-room.  Prom  the  first  baby  sentence 
sent  home,  every  "  letter "  is  filled  with  illustrations,  and 
■Christmas  cards,  birth-day  remembrances,  and  souvenirs  for 
all  occasions  are  the  work  of  their  own  hands,  made  with  little 
assistance,  and  by  the  older  pupils  usually  without  even  a 
suggestion,  proving  to  our  satisfaction  that  careful  work  in 
the  beginning  pays  in  every  department. 

The  Swedish  system  of  sewing  is  taught,  and  this,  with  the 
Tegular  lessons  and  sloyd,  are  given  to  all  pupils  above  the 
kindergarten. 

KiNDEBGAKTEN. 

We  make  the  kindergarten  system  the  basis  underlying  all 
the  work  of  the  School,  having  had  from  one  to  three  trained 
kindergartners  since  the  opening  of  the  second  year  of  school, 
and,  believing  that  a  happy  occupation  induces  thought  and 
furnishes  the  best  possible  incentive  to  speech,  we  give  great 
prominence  to  every  department  of  hand-work.  Believing, 
also,  that  the  ability  to  picture  a  thought  and  to  write  it  in 
words  adds  to  its  accuracy,  and  tends  directly  to  habits  of 
more  careful  observation  and  reliable  memory,  the  kindergar- 
ten is,  therefore,  associated  at  once  with  drawing  and  writing 
on  the  black-board.  The  little  tot  of  three,  being  given  several 
times  every  day  short  free-arm  exercises  on  the  black-board, 
learns  to  hold  the  chalk  lightly  and  move  the  arm  properly, 
and  is  prepared  to  take  up  both  drawing  and  writing  with 
ease  and  facility.  When  this  ease  of  movement  is  once 
thoroughly  acquired,  what  is  to  many  a  task  becomes  to  him 
a  pleasure,  and  the  black-board  is  henceforth  a  never-ending 
source  of  instruction  and  amusement,  giving  him  an  avenue  of 
almost  perfect  expression,  and  furnishing  his  teacher  an  op- 
portunity of  supplying  the  word  for  which  he  hungers. 

The  kindergarten  department  comprises  the  babies  and 
least  advanced  pupils,  who  during  school-hours  occupy  the 
gymnasium,  a  room  45  x  25.  They  work  in  small  classes  and 
are  separated  by  black-board  screens,  which  are  easily  moved 
and  admit  of  freedom  for  the  children. 

The  beginners  have  short  lessons  with  the  bright  colors  and 
pleasing  forms  of  the  kindergarten,  which,  with  drawing, 
"writing,  Delsarte,  and  the  preparatory  articulation  exercises, 


The  McCowen  Oral  School.  15 

serve  to  promote  habits  of  attention  and  self-control,  and  to 
develop  the  povrer  of  observation.  At  the  same  time,  as  they 
are  always  addressed  by  speech,  they  learn  to  recognize  lan- 
g'uage  in  sentences,  and,  after  a  time,  to  speak  oft-repeated 
easy  words  and  to  imitate  the  hand-work  in  the  various  de- 
partments, and  these,  with  the  necessary  frequent  rests  and 
games,  occupy  the  time. 

The  second  class  continue  the  exercises  for  the  cultivation 
of  the  sense  of  sight  and  touch,  but  give  more  time  to  articu- 
lation and  the  acquisition  of  a  vocabulary,  using  the  kinder- 
garten occupations  as  an  incentive  to  speech,  and  writing  and 
•drawing  freely  in  every  lesson. 

The  third  class  give  less  time  to  the  kindergarten  occupa- 
tions, take  simple  combinations  of  numbers  with  objects, 
draw  and  write  on  the  black-board  with  rapidity  and  ease, 
learn  to  translate  script  into  print,  using  primers  and  very 
easy  books  ;  the  chief  object  of  every  lesson  being  the  develop- 
ment of  thought  and  a  better  and  freer  use  of  elementary 
language. 

The  older  classes  have  regular  lessons  from  text-books,  such 
as  are  used  in  the  public  schools.  The  most  advanced  class 
comprises  three  pupils — eleven,  twelve,  and  thirteen  years  of 
Age,  the  last  two  congenitally  deaf — who  have  been  in  school 
six  and  seven  years.  They  have  lessons  in  arithmetic, 
geography,  history,  physiology,  and  word-analysis.  Their 
perfect  understanding  by  speech-reading  and  their  unusual 
ability  to  express  their  thoughts  without  hesitancy  in  either 
spoken  or  written  language  confirm  the  conviction  that  has 
been  growing  upon  us  for  the  past  nine  years,  namely,  that 
infant  kindergarten  schools  are  a  necessity  for  the  best  de- 
velopment of  the  deaf. 

Summary. 

1.  Teach  the  deaf  child  in  infancy  the  things  a  hearing  child 
unconsciously  learns  during  that  period. 

2.  Use  kindergarten  methods ;  give  the  child  something  to 
do,  then  supply  the  word  to  express  the  awakened  thought. 

3.  Surround  the  child  with  black-boards  ;  teach  drawing  and 
writing  from  the  beginning — the  first  for  the  sake  of  freedom 
of  expression,  and  the  latter  for  accuracy — and  insist  upon 
accuracy  from  the  beginning. 


The  McCowen  Oral  School.  17 

4.  Encourage  the  child  to  ask  questions,  and  cultivate  in 
him  a  desire  personally  to  investigate  everything  that  comes 
within  his  observation. 

5.  Place  books  suited  to  his  comprehension  vrithin  his 
reach,  encourage  him  to  read  aloud,  take  the  time  to  talk 
freely  and  frequently  with  him. 

By  using  this  natural  method  from  early  infancy,  a  deaf 
child  will  acquire  a  knowledge  and  use  of  language  which  will 
enable  him  to  take  up  the  regular  school-room  curriculum  at 
much  less  disadvantage  than  is  possible  where,  as  under  existing 
circumstances,  a  large  per  cent,  of  deaf  children  from  ten  to 
fifteen  years  of  age  are  still  struggling  with  the  a,  b,  a  of 
language. 

Ten  years  ago,  in  1883,  our  School  opened  as  the  only  one, 
so  far  as  known,  to  solicit  very  young  deaf  children  as  pupils, 
and  from  that  time  there  has  been  a  steady  growth  of  public 
opinion  favoring  the  earlier  education  of  the  deaf.  In  1888, 
five  years  later,  the  "  Sarah  Fuller  Home  for  Little  Children 
Who  Cannot  Hear "  was  established  in  Massachusetts.  In 
1889  the  "  Albany  Home  School  for  the  Oral  Instruction  of 
the  Deaf,"  and  in  1892  the  "  Home  for  the  Training  in  Speech 
of  Deaf  Children  before  they  are  of  School  Age  "  in  Philadel- 
phia followed. 

We  hope  these  little  schools  are  but  the  beginning,  and  that 
the  next  ten  years  will  see  established  all  over  the  Union,  in 
the  great  centres  of  population,  infant  kindergartens  for  the 
deaf,  where  thej'  will  not  only  be  taught  to  talk,  but  will  be 
given  that  careful  training  of  the  whole  nature,  by  skilful 
kindergarten  methods,  which  are  now  considered  absolutely 
necessary  for  the  proper  development  of  the  latent  possibilities 
of  the  hearing  child  and  are  immeasurably  more  necessary  for 
the  deaf  child. 

To  Parents  and  Peiends. 

Things  to  Rememher  in  Addressing  Deaf  Children. 

1.  Gain  the  attention  of  the  child  before  addressing  him. 

2.  Speak  naturally ;  be  sure  the  first  word  is  understood ; 
if  necessary  unduly  to  emphasize  a  new  word  in  first  giving  it, 
repeat  the  sentence  till  it  is  easily  recognized  when  spoken  in 
a  perfectly  natural  manner. 

3.  Avoid  mouthing. 

4.  Avoid  speaking  slowly  or  separating  words.

5.  Avoid  confining  yourself  to  a  limited  vocabulary  or  to 
any  one  form  of  expression.     Use  a  variety  of  idioms. 

G.  Use  correct  conversational  forms  of  language  always  in 
addressing  the  child.

The  Ephpheta  School  for  the  Deaf, 


CHICAGO,  ILLINOIS, 

I884-I893. 


By  MARY  C.  HENDRICK,       * 

Principal  of  Ihe  School. 


THE  EPHPHETA  SCHOOL  FOR  THE  DEAF. 

In  October,  1884,  the  Ephpheta  School  for  the  Deaf  was 
opened  in  a  rented  room  on  "West  Twelfth  street,  Chicago.  Only 
two  pupils  were  enrolled  on  the  day  of  opening,  but  before 
the  end  of  the  year  the  number  had  increased  to  fifteen.  At 
the  end  of  the  second  year  there  were  twenty-eight  pupils  in 
school,  a  number  which  necessitated  more  ample  accommoda- 
tions and  the  services  of  another  teacher. 

Up  to  this  time  the  School  was  a  day-school ;  but,  as  applica- 
tions had  been  received  for  the  admission  of  pupils  living  at 
a  distance,  it  was  decided  to  receive  a  limited  number  of 
boarders.  The  necessary  rooms  were  secured  at  St.  Joseph's 
Home,  409  S.  May  street,  and  there  the  School  still  remains. 


ST.  JOSEPH'S  HOME,  CHICAGO,  ILLINOIS. 


In  the  winter  of  the  third  year  modelling  in  clay  and  wood- 
carving  were  introduced,  and  have  since  been  continued,  with 
the  result  of  cultivating  the  taste  of  the  pupils  and  giving 
them  practice  in  the  use  of  tools.  Sewing  is  taught  to  all  the 
girls,  and  dressmaking  to  those  who  show  taste  for  it.  All 
the  girls  also  receive  practical  instruction  in  domestic  econoriij'. 

During  its  nine  years  of  existence  one  hundred  and  thirty-

four  pupils  have  been  enrolled  in  the  School,  and  at  the 
present  time  (February,  1893)  seventy-seven  are  accommodated, 
of  vrhom  forty-five  are  boarders.  The  corps  of  teachers  has 
been  increased  to  seven,  one  of  whom  is  a  former  pupil. 

The  Ephpheta  School  is  a  private  school  and  is  supported 
by  voluntary  contributions  from  its  friends,  notably  from  the 
members  of  the  Ephpheta  Society,  to  whom  the  officers  of  the 
School  [feel  they  owe  a  deep  debt  of  gratitude  for  interest 
shown  and  help  given.

The     Mariae     Consilia     Deaf-Mute 
Institution, 


ST.  LOUIS,  MISSOURI, 
1885-1893. 


By  Sister  MARY  ADELE  HENNESSY, 

Principal  of  the  Institution. 


THE  MARI^  CONSILIA  DEAF-MUTE  INSTITUTION. 

The  Catholic  deaf-mute  children  under  the  care  of  the  Sis- 
ters of  St.  Joseph  of  Carondelet  were  transferred  to  the  above- 
named  Institution  in  September,  1885. 

They  then  consisted  of  twenty-five  girls ;  two  years  later, 
the  boys,  under  the  care  of  the  same  sisterhood  in  Hannibal, 
Mo.,  were  added  to  the  inmates  of  Marise  Consilia,  where  they 
are  taught,  with  the  other  members,  the  usual  course  of  in- 
struction. 

This  is  done  by  the  "  combined  system."  The  manual  alpha- 
bet, pantomime,  writing,  speech  and  lip-reading  are  used  only 
as  a  means  for  acquiring  the  proper  use  of  language,  while  aU. 
the  pupils  are  led,  as  nearly  as  can  be,  to  articulate  their  ideas. 

One  teacher  is  devoted  to  this  purpose  and  has  had  unlooked- 
for  success  in  her  labors. 

The  girls  are  taught  plain  and  fancy  needlework,  music,  and 
painting ;  out  of  school-hours  they  are  initiated  into  the  many 
practical  household  duties  that  must  in  the  future  fall  to  their 
lot. 

The  boys  have  an  opportunity  of  learning  type-setting, 
printing,  and  gardening,  though  at  present  these  advantages 
are  rather  limited.  The  school  terms  are  the  same  as  in  other 
educational  institutions,  with  the  usual  two  months'  vacation 
in  summer  and  a  week  or  ten  days  during  the  Christmas  holi- 
days. The  pupils  attend  religious  exercises  every  morning  in 
the  chapel ;  the  older  ones  belong  to  a  Sodality,  which  brings 
them  together  every  Sunday  afternoon,  when  the  Kev.  Chap- 
lain gives  them  a  lecture. 

A  circulating  library  is  also  at  their  disposal,  intended  to 
render  useful  their  hours  of  leisure. 

The  Institution  has  now  an  average  attendance  of  about 
fifty  pupils  of  both  sexes,  most  of  whom  are  boarders. 

Four  teachers  are  constantly  employed ;  this  number  includes 
the  principal. 

Thus  far  this  School  has  been  supported  mainly  by  the  en- 
deavors of  the  community  in  charge,  though  a  small  tuition 
fee  is  required  of  those  able  to  pay.

is  rejected  for  want  of  means ;  neither  does  a  difference  of 
religious  views  exclude  any  one. 

Within  the  past  year  the  Sisters  of  St.  Joseph  have  bought 
a  very  fine  piece  of  property  in  the  southern  part  of  the  city, 
about  one-half  mile  south  of  the  electric  railway,  with  the  in- 
tention of  removing  thereto  the  deaf-mute  boys,  where  they 
may  have  desirable  facilities  for  learning  trades  and  other  in- 
dustries. 

It  is  hoped  that  this  new  Institution  may  be  in  readiness  by 
the  coming  September. 

This  work  is  especially  dear  to  the  Sisters  of  St.  Joseph,  as 


MABI^  CONSILIA  DEAF-MUTE  INSTITUTION. 


it  was  the  main  object  which  caused  the  congregation's  foun- 
dation in  the  United  States. 

In  1836  the  Et.  Rev.  Bishop  Eosati,  then  presiding  over  the 
diocese  of  St.  Louis,  invited  them  from  Lyons,  France,  for  the 
express  purpose  of  instructing  deaf-mutes. 

The  Sisters  appointed  for  the  work  set  about  learning  the 
methods  then  used  in  the  deaf-mute  schools  of  St.  Etienne, 
France,  and,  leaving  their  native  land,  were  the  first  to  open  a 
Catholic  school  for  this  afflicted  class  west  of  the  Mississippi. 
They  settled  in  South  St.  Louis  in  1837,  and  here  Sisters  St. 
John  and  Celestine  undertook  their  duties  as  teachers  of  deaf- 
mutes.  The  former  became  foundress  of  the  congregation  in 
Philadelphia,  while  the  latter  remained  in  the  first  house  and 


The  Marim  Consilia  Institution.  5 

became  the  first  superioress-general  of  the  Sisters  of  St. 
Joseph  of  Carondelet. 

The  congregation  dates  back  to  1650,  when  the  first  mem- 
bers were  established  by  Rev.  Jean  Paul  Medaille ;  but  they, 
with  the  many  other  religious  congregations,  were  scattered 
during  the  revolution,  many  of  them  suffering  imprisonment, 
and  were  saved  from  the  guillotine  only  by  the  fall  of  Robes- 
pierre. In  1793  Napoleon  permitted  them  to  resume  their 
community  life,  and  Lyons  was  then  the  city  to  open  her  gates 
to  them.  Since  then  it  has  been  looked  upon  as  the  mother 
house  of  the  congregation  in  Europe.

The    Keeler    Private    Articulation 
Class  for  Deaf-Mutes, 


27  East  Forty-Sixth  St.,  New  York  City, 
1885-1893. 


By  SARAH  WARREN  KEELER, 

Principal  of  the  School. 


THE  KEELEE   PRIVATE   ARTICULATION  CLASS 
FOR  DEAF-MUTES. 

This  School  was  established  in  1885  by  its  present  principal, 
who  for  ten  years  had  been  an  instructor  of  articulation  in  the 
New  Tork  Institution  for  the  Improved  Instruction  of  Deaf- 
Mutes.  When  opened  it  was  located  No.  72  Fiftieth  street, 
from  which  place  it  was  removed  to  No.  618  Lexington  avenue, 
and  since  has  been  conducted  by  the  principal  in  connection 
with  her  academic  school  for  girls,  located  at  27  East  Forty- 
Sixth  street,  New  York. 

The  following  principles  govern  the  mode  of  instruction  at 
this  School : 

First.  All  articulate  sounds  are  produced  by  the  vibrations 
of  the  vocal  cords. 

Second.  The  vibrations  of  the  vocal  cords  may  be  felt  on  the 
larynx,  thorax,  nose,  lips,  and  head. 

Third.  The  non-vocal  sounds  are  produced  by  causing  the 
vocal  organs  to  assume  the  correct  position  for  any  given 
sound,  and  while  they  retain  that  position  exhale  the  breath, 
either  gently  or  expulsively,  as  the  sound  requires. 

Fourth.  A  deaf-mute  learns  to  produce  any  given  sound  by 
attention,  by  observing  the  position  and  changes  of  position 
of  the  vocal  organs  of  his  teacher,  by  feeling  on  one  hand  the 
sound  vibrations  in  the  throat,  etc.,  of  the  teacher,  and  on  the 
other  hand  like  vibrations  in  his  own  throat,  etc.,  and  by  con- 
trolling and  using  his  breath  in  a  manner  precisely  similar  to 
that  of  his  teacher. 

The  deaf  may  be  classified  as  follows : 

First.  Congenital,  or  those  born  deaf. 

Second.  Semi-deaf,  or  those  born  with  a  slight  degree  of 
hearing  whicli  they  still  retain. 

Third.  Semi-mutes,  or  those  who  heard  in  childhood  and 
acquired  a  knowledge  of  speech  before  becoming  deaf. 

A  semi-mute  having  acquired  a  knowledge  of  language  pre- 
vious to  the  illness  which  resulted  in  deafness  requires  constant 
practice  in  articulation ;  otherwise  impaired  speech  and  eventu- 
ally complete  loss  is  the  result. 

In  common  with  the  congenitaUy  deaf,  the  semi-deaf  should 


4  The  Keeler  Articulation  Clasi^. 

acquire  a  thorough  knowledge  of  lip-reading — the  art  of 
understanding-  the  speech  of  other  persons  by  carefully  and  in- 
tently watching  the  lips  and  other  vocal  organs  with  their 
changes  of  position  in  speaking.  The  ability  to  do  so  ma- 
terially aids  the  hearing  power  of  the  partially  deaf. 

The  semi-deaf,  by  a  proper  system  of  training,  can  learn  to 
modulate  the  voice  and  attain  a  natural  tone  when  speaking. 

As  a  rule,  all  of  the  deaf  who  have  been  taught  speech  in 
this  School  converse  freely  with  one  another,  readily  read  the 
lips  of  others  talking  to  them,  and  almost  exclusively  associate 
with  hearing  people. 

Neither  the  manual  alphabet,  gestures,  nor  signs  of  any  kind 
are  permitted  in  the  School,  all  instructions  being  imparted 
either  orally  or  by  writing.  Some  of  the  pupils  attending 
these  classes  have  left  to  attend  private  or  public  schools  as 
soon  as  they  felt  sufficiently  qualified  to  do  so,  and  some  have 
attended  ordinary  academic  schools  whilst  members  of  our 
articulation  classes. 

In  all  instances  where  the  pupils  of  our  classes  have  been 
normally  endowed  intellectually,  they  have  acquitted  them- 
selves creditably  when  attending  schools  for  the  hearing. 

The  classes  have  been  conducted  by  the  principal,  assisted 
by  one  or  more  teachers  or  students  receiving  normal  training. 

The  age  of  pupils  attending  these  classes  has  varied  from 
nine  to  eighteen  years.  The  number  of  pupils  attending  dur- 
ing the  school  year  ending  June,  1892,  was  nine,  comprising 
five  boys  and  four  girls,  and  the  average  annual  attendance 
since  the  organization  of  the  class  in  1885  has  also  been  nine.

THE  ST.  MAEY'S  INSTITUTE  FOE  DEAF-MUTES. 

The  St.  Mary's  Institute  for  Deaf-Mutes  was  opened  in  the 
year  1886,  under  the  auspices  of  an  order  of  the  Eoman  Catholic 
church,  in  order  that  a  school  for  the  deaf  might  be  provided 
in  Minnesota,  in  which  pupils  of  Catholic  families  should 
receive,  in  addition  to  the  instruction  given  in  secular  schools, 
instruction  in  the  Catholic  religion,  and  should  be  placed  under 
Catholic  influences. 

The  Institute  has  been  conducted  since  its  first  opening  at 
536  Mississippi  street,  St.  Paul,  Minnesota. 

The  first  principal  of  the  Institute  was  Miss  Boucher,  for- 
merly of  New  York.  In  1889  Miss  Boucher  was  succeeded  by 
Miss  Nardin,  of  Buffalo,  who  still  holds  the  position. 

The  Institute  opened  with  nine  pupils.  At  present  the  num- 
ber is  forty-five,  of  whom  twenty-two  are  male  and  twenty- 
three  female.  About  eighty  pupils  in  all  have  received  instruc- 
tion. 

In  general,  the  minimum  age  of  admission  is  six  years,  but 
there  two  pupils  under  that. 

The  number  of  teachers,  including  the  principal,  is  four. 

Both  the  manual  and  the  oral  methods  of  instruction  are 
pursued  in  the  Institute.  Some  of  the  pupils  are  taught  exclu 
sively  by  the  oral  method,  and  part  of  those  taught  by  the 
manual  method  receive  special  training  in  articulation  and 
speech-reading.  In  the  year  1891  forty  of  the  forty-seven  pu- 
pils were  taught  to  speak  and  read  speech. 

The  number  of  hours  passed  in  the  school-room  daily  is 
six  and  a  half. 

The  industries  taught  are  dressmaking,  printing,  shoemak- 
ing,  and  tailoring. 

The  annual  vacation  extends  from  June  25  to  the  first  Mon- 
day in  September. 

The  Institute  is  supported  by  voluntary  contributions,  tuition 
fees,  and  the  profits  of  an  institution  which  supplies  homes  at 
reasonable  rates  to  homeless  working  women. 


The  Sarah  Fuller  Home  for  Little 
Children  who  cannot  Hear, 


WEST    MEDFORD,    MASSACHUSETTS, 
1 888-1 893. 


By     SARAH     FULLER, 

President  of  the  Corporation. 


THE    SARAH    FULLER   HOME    FOR   LITTLE    CHIL- 
DREN WHO  CANNOT  HEAR. 

The  Sarah  Fuller  Home  was  founded  and  incorporated  in 
June,  1888,  as  a  home  and  kindergarten  for  very  young  deaf 
children.  Miss  Fuller,  for  twenty  years  principal  of  the 
Horace  Mann  School  for  the  Deaf,  in  Boston,  had  long  been 
convinced  that  deaf  children  would  acquire  speech  with  com- 
parative ease  if  they  could  be  taught  at  an  earlier  age  than 
that  at  which  they  can  enter  the  public  schools,  and  that  an 
elementary  knowledge  of  speech-reading  would  also  be  ob- 
tained. In  accordance  with  this  idea,  and  in  response  to  an 
appeal  niade  by  Mrs.  Francis  Brooks,  many  generous  friends 
contributed  money  for  the  beginning  of  this  work.  An  attrac- 
tive cottage,  situated  in  a  beautiful  orchard  on  the  banks  of 
the  Mystic  river,  in  West  Medford,  was  hired  for  this  Home 
School.  It  was  fitted  and  furnished,  the  necessary  assistants 
procured,  and  the  Home  opened  on  June  fifteenth,  with  one 
pupil.  By  October,  nine  pupils  had  been  admitted.  Since 
the  opening  of  the  school,  twenty-seven  children  have  been 
received.  There  are  now,  March  first,  eighteen  hundred  ninety- 
three,  eleven  children  under  instruction. 

'  The  thought  underlying  all  work  with  these  little  ones  is 
that  speech,  as  it  is  seen  upon  the  lips  of  those  about  them, 
should  convey  its  full  meaning  to  them,  and  that  every  possi- 
ble encouragement  should  be  given  them  to  imitate  the  move- 
ments of  the  mouth  in  speech  and  to  use  their  voices.  Involun- 
tary sounds  made  by  the  children  are  noted,  and  each  one  is 
reproduced  by  teacher  and  pupil  until  a  habit  of  associating 
definite  appearances  of  the  mouth  with  certain  sounds  is  well 
fixed.  Through  this  incidental  work,  and  by  a  carefull}'  ar- 
ranged plan  for  the  development  of  the  more  difficult  elements 
of  speech,  the  pupUs  acquire  a  vocabulary  in  a  way  similar  to 
that  in  which  hearing  children  learn  to  speak  the  language  of 
the  nursery.  Their  teachers  and  attendants  use  speech  with 
them  constantly,  encouraging  every  effort,  however  crude,  to 
speak  the  names  of  their  toys  or  express  their  wishes  in  speech. 
They  spend  portions  of  each  day  in  the  school-room,  where 
they  learn  to  associate  spoken,  written,  and  printed  names 


TTie  Sarah  Fuller  Home.  5 

"with  objects.  They  also  learn  to  recognize  number  groups 
and  different  colors,  and  to  write  upon  black-board  and  slate. 

Pictures,  charts,  and  slated  cloth  cover  the  walls  of  the  va^ 
lious  rooms,  and  boxes  containing  crayon  and  erasers,  within 
•easy  reach  of  the  little  ones,  furnish  ample  material  for  amuse- 
ment and  instruction.  The  slated  cloth  also  answers  another 
purpose,  as  it  enables  teachers,  attendants,  and  visitors  to 
write  whatever  they  say  to  the  children.  Picture  books  and 
magazines  fill  the  shelves  of  the  bookcase,  to  which  the  chil- 
dren have  free  access,  and  the  thumb-marked  pages,  with  their 
worn  edges,  testify  to  the  many  happy  hours  spent  in  an  eager 
search  for  some  favorite  picture,  the  name  of  which  they  can 
speak.  It  is  believed  that  a  habit  of  reading  may  be  begun 
with  very  young  deaf  children,  and  a  use  of  books  made  at- 
tractive to  them.  One  of  the  delights  of  the  time  immedi- 
ately preceding  the  dinner  and  the  tea  hours  is  the  oppor- 
tunity given  for  poring  over  books  and  finding  familiar  words 
and  phrases  with  illustrations  of  them.  The  repeated  de- 
mands for  the  teachers'  time  and  attention,  and  the  shouts  of 
delight  as  one  and  another  make  a  discovery,  are  conclusive 
•evidences  of  the  power  of  words  to  present  living  pictures  to 
children. 

The  following  sketch  of  a  visit  to  the  Home,  published  in 
1888  under  the  title  of  "  L  eaves  from  the  Orchard,"  by  Miss 
Edith  Parker  Jordan,  gives  an  interesting  description  of  the 
methods  pursued  with  the  children  : 

It  was  a  bright,  clear  day  in  early  autumn  when  I  made  my  first  visit 
to  this  little  home. 

Leaving  the  cars  at  the  "West  Medtord  station,  I  passed  the  church, 
then  turning  abruptly  to  the  left,  as  directed,  followed  the  railway  for  a 
short  distance  back  toward  Boston.  "You  can't  fail  to  find  it,"  I  had 
been  told  ;  and  even  before  I  saw  the  name  over  the  door  of  a  neat  little 
white  cottage  I  felt  I  had  reached  the  house — a  general  atmosphere  of 
happiness  and  "  home  "  surrounded  it.  Through  the  window  I  caught 
a  glimpse  of  little  faces,  and  when  the  door  was  opened  by  the  house- 
keeper, immediately  from  the  hallway  I  entered  the  school-room.  This 
is  the  picture  I  saw :  a  room  flooded  with  sunshine,  a  lady  seated  at  one 
side  of  a  low  table  (shaped  like  a  horseshoe),  a  row  of  little  people  on 
the  other,  calling  to  mind  the  conventional  geography  representation  of 
&amp;  ooralialand — the  teacher,  calm,  serene,  in  the  lagoon;  the  children 
bobbing,  dancing,  like  the  wavelets  on  the  outer  coast.  Bright,  happy 
little  folk  they  were,  the  eldest  six,  others  a  year  or  two  younger,  and  the 
youngest — "  Baby,"  I  called  her,  for  she  was  nothing  more — only  three 
years  old.    On  the  table  before  them  were  splints,  blocks,  and  boards  with 


The  Sarah  Fuller  Home.  7 

colored  pegs.  These  they  were  busily  sorting  and  arranging  as  pleased 
their  fancy.  It  was  interesting  to  notice  the  tastes  displayed ;  one  in- 
dustriously placing  her  splints  in  piles  of  different  colors,  casting  aside 
all  of  an  unattractive  green  and  carefully  hoarding  the  blue  and  red  ; 
another,  at  his  teacher's  left  hand,  was  diligently  setting,  alternately, 
black  and  white  pegs  in  a  diagonal  line,  declining  all  assistance  from  the 
little  boy  who  stood  beside  him.  Thus  they  plied  their  nimble  fingers, 
and  I,  while  talking  with  their  teacher,  observed  the  appointments  of 
the  room.  In  one  corner  stood  a  long,  low  black-board  covered  with  the 
first  attempts  of  baby  fingers  in  penmanship  ;  above  it,  on  the  wall,  a 
set  of  shelves  laden  with  labelled  toys  and  objects  of  all  sorts — a  dog 
and  cat  standing  amicably  side  by  side,  a  stranded  boat,  a  ball,  a  fan, 
and  hosts  of  others.    Pictures  and  charts  adorned  the  other  walls. 

Taking  from  the  shelf  a  worsted  ball  and  the  cat,  the  teacher  directed 
the  oldest  boy  to  write  the  name  of  each  object.  After  a  struggle  with 
an  unmanageable  letter,  she  went  to  his  assistance,  and  soon  "ball" 
appeared  in  a  good  round  hand.  "Baby,"  not  to  be  outdone,  must  show 
what  she  could  do,  so,  running  to  the  board,  with  her  chubby  hand  pro- 
duced an  astonishing  number  of  big  round  o's  and  x's,  shaking  her  curls 
in  delight  at  her  achievement. 

"  You  shall  see  how  these  little  ones  learn  to  speak,"  said  the  teacher, 
and  from  the  floor,  where  "  Baby  "  now  sat  playing  with  some  blocks,  she 
took  a  doll,  and  calling  a  little  one  in  kilts  to  her  side,  placed  a  finger  of 
one  little  hand  upon  her  throat.  With  the  other  hand  at  his  own,  he 
intently  watched  her  mouth  as  she  spoke  the  word  d/&gt;ll.  Slowly  and  dis- 
tinctly came  the  response  "  d-o-U."  "And  his  mouth  was  opened  im- 
mediately and  his  tongue  loosed,  and  he  spake  "  f  with  new  power  these 
words  were  borne  in  upon  me  as  I  listened. 

"  None  of  the  exercises,"  said  the  teacher,  "  exceed  twenty  minutes. 
It  is  now  time  for  them  to  go  out  to  play  in  the  orchard  ;"  and,  in  charge 
of  an  attendant,  off  they  trooped,  leaving  me  to  hear  this  history  of  the 
Home,  and  interesting  stories  of  its  little  ones. 

"  This  Home  was  founded,"  said  she,  "  upon  the  conviction  that  little 
deaf  children  can  learn  to  speak  at  as  early  an  age  as  others,  if  the  nat- 
ural sounds  which  all  children  make  in  infancy  are  properly  utilized. 
The  fact  that  parents  of  deaf  infants  rarely  discover  the  condition  of 
their  children  until  after  the  age  when  they  would  naturally  use  speech 
is  strong  proof  of  the  absence  of  any  apparent  difference  between  them 
and  hearing  children.  The  voice  of  a  deaf  child  in  laughing  or  crying 
is  not  unlike  that  of  others  ;  and  why  should  a  mother  think  it  knows 
nothing  of  sound  ?  Miss  Sarah  Fuller,  Principal  of  the  Horace  Mann 
School  for  the  Deaf,  in  Boston,  has  long  believed  that  it  is  possible  to 
teach  little  deaf  children  to  imitate  speech  by  sigjit,  as  we  ourselves 
learned  it  from  hearing,  and  her  wish  to  open  a  '  Home  School,'  where 
little  children  whose  parents  have  not  time  to  instruct  them  could  be  re- 
ceived, has  been  most  happily  realized  by  the  beneficence  of  Mrs.  Francis 
Brooks,  of  Boston.  In  response  to  an  appeal  from  Mrs.  Brooks,  other 
generous  friends  contributed  cordially  to  aid  in  establishing  this  the  first 
infant  school  for  the  deaf  in  America.

"  The  first  pupil  to  be  received  was  a  '  baby  boy,'  one  would  have  said, 
so  immature  he  seemed  when  he  came  from  his  home,  which  was  poor, 
comfortless,  and  with  little  in  it  to  stimulate  thought.  Soon  his  ready 
adoption  of  the  new  ways  of  life  with  us  showed  that  he  possessed  a 
very  observing  mind.  At  table  he  imitated  so  carefully  and  unobtru- 
sively those  about  him  that  no  one  would  have  suspected  he  was  not  '  to 
the  manor  born.'  A  prouder  child  could  not  be  found  than  my  little 
man  when  he  comprehended  that  the  six  letters  J-o-s-e-p-h  represented 
himself.  He  was  somebody ;  he  realized  for  the  first  time  his  own  per- 
sonality. He  was  the  nucleus  around  which  others  soon  gathered  and 
now  form  a  happy  little  family.  One  little  girl,  of  unknown  parentage, 
a  little  waif  '  out  of  the  everywhere  into  the  here,'  is  enjoying  her  first 
home.  Clinging  and  affectionate,  she  shows  a  longing  for  the  '  mother 
love  '  she  never  knew.     I  assure  you,  full  measure  is  given  her  here. 

"Now,  let  me  show  you  our  house,"  said  she,  rising,  and  leading  the 
way  to  the  sitting-room,  bright  with  fresh  walls,  dainty  curtains,  and 
pretty  antique  furniture,  past  a  little  bedroom  where  tired  babies  may 
take  a  noonday  nap,  up  the  staircase,  whose  left-hand  turning  brought 
us  to  the  children's  sleeping-rooms.  At  the  foot  of  the  beds,  where  it 
catches  the  waking  eyes  of  the  children,  stands  a  screen,  gay  with  pic- 
tures, affording  inexhaustible  fields  of  discovery  during  the  tedious  pro- 
cess of  dressing.  The  genial  sun,  now  fast  declining,  shone  full  upon 
the  snowy  pillows,  leaving  a  good-night  benediction  for  the  little  heads. 

Out  in  the  orchard,  under  a  huge  old  apple  tree,  we  found  the  chil- 
dren. Eagerly  they  showed  me  the  pile  of  sand,  where  they  were  dig- 
ging, the  wheelbarrow,  the  shovels,  and  the  apples — so  many  they  had 
gathered.  At  the  foot  of  the  orchard  slowly  winds  the  Mystic  river. 
Over  it  one  looks  out  across  the  marshes — picturesque  with  clumps  of 
grass,  hay-ricks,  and  narrow  lines  of  shallow  water,  to  the  scattered 
houses  on  the  outskirts  of  the  town.  In  and  out  among  the  quince  and 
pear  trees  we  found  our  way  to  a  little  building,  planned  and  fitted  up 
expressly  for  the  children's  play-room.  Along  on  one  side  of  the  room 
was  a  low  seat  or  locker,  in  which  they  keep  their  toys  and  various  games. 
A  large  tray  of  sand  serves  for  play,  as  well  as  for  the  first  steps  in  draw- 
ing and  writing.  "  In  this  play-room,"  said  the  teacher,  "  the  children 
are  as  free  as  in  the  orchard,  and  when  the  weather  is  stormy  or  unsuit- 
able to  be  in  open  air  we  come  here  for  games  and  for  exercise." 

.  Gathering  the  little  ones  together,  we  returned  to  the  house,  and  each 
little  high  chair  at  the  table  was  quickly  occupied  by  a  happy,  hungry 
child.  Beside  each  plate  stood  a  card — "  a  bill  of  fare" — by  which  the 
child  learns  to  indicate  its  wants  before  it  can  speak  words. 

"This  is  a  veritable  dollies'  house!"  I  cried,  "but  peopled,  as  my 
;3hildhood's  fancy  longedfor,  with  animated  dolls.  No  aggressive  signs  of 
'  grown-up  people '  meet  one  in  this  place.  It  is  indeed  a  children's 
home,  pure  and  fresh  as  the  little  souls  confided  to  its  care."  I  could 
not  turn  away  from  this  charming  little  home  without  one  more  look  at 
its  children,  snugly  tucked  in  bed  for  the  night.  As  I  said  "Good-bye," 
and  paused  a  moment  at  the  gateway,  a  gust  of  wind  sweeping  through 
the  trees  whirled  the  autumn  leaves  about  my  feet.     I  gathered  this

handful,  aud  liope  that  you  too  may  go  and  see  how  little  deaf  childi-en 
live,  love,  and  learn  in  the  Sarah  Fuller  Home. 

By  October,  1891,  it  was  found  that  the  needs  of  the  little 
school  had  outgrown  its  accommodation.  There  had  also 
come  changes  in  the  neighborhood  which  made  its  removal 
desirable.  Accordingly,  the  purchase  was  made  of  a  house 
and  stable  with  some  sixty  thousand  square  feet  of  land  on 
Woburn  street,  and  in  the  following  January  the  Home  was 
removed  to  this  place.  The  estate  is  situated  on  high,  dry 
land ;  it  has  a  southern  exposure,  and  there  is  a  wood  and 
pasture  near  it.  The  stable  was  remodelled  and  a  large  play- 
room made  there  for  the  children.     The  walls  of  this  play- 


room are  hung  with  charts,  and  with  slated  cloth  presenting 
the  names  of  toys  and  various  articles  about  the  room.  Port- 
able slates  and  a  large  tray  of  sand  serve  for  play  as  well  as 
for  the  first  lessons  in  drawing  and  writing.  A  light,  airy 
room,  extending  over  the  entire  length  of  the  front  of  the 
building,  suitably  furnished,  can  be  used  in  case  of  serioua 
illness  or  contagious  disease. 

In  October,  1892,  the  Home  sustained  a  great  loss  in  the 
death  of  Mrs.  Francis  Brooks,  its  founder.  Mrs.  Brooks's 
syihpathies  were  quick  and  tender,  and  she  appreciated,  as  but 
few  can,  the  discouragements  and  difficulties  that  beset  the 
way  of  little  deaf  learners.  Her  plans  for  them  were  wrought; 
out  of  careful  observation  of  child  nature  and  child  need,  and

were  well  considered.  It  is  well  known  how  fully  she  gave  of 
herself  and  of  her  wealth  to  make  real  her  ideal  life  for  little 
deaf  children,  and  to  give  joy  and  comfort  to  parents  who 
crave  the  blessing  of  speech  for  their  children. 

It  may  be  said  that  this  Home  School,  begun  as  an  experi- 
ment, has  proved  a  great  success,  and  that  the  results,  shown 
in  the  progress  of  the  children,  in  their  health  and  their  hap- 
piness, are  entirely  satisfactory. 

Terms  of  Admission. 

Pupils  under  five  years  of  age  are  received,  and,  in  order  to 
preserve  as  fully  as  possible  the  family  life,  the  number  of 
pupils  is  limited  to  ten. 

One  hundred  and  fifty  dollars  per  yeai;  is  charged  for  board 
and  instruction.

THE  EASTEEN  IOWA   SCHOOL  FOR  THE  DEAF. 

I  WAS  born,  raised,'  and  educated  in  Indiana.  From  the  fall 
of  1860  to  the  summer  of  1868  I  was  connected  with  the  In- 
diana Institution  for  the  Deaf  as  a  teacher. 

In  1869  I  established  the  Nebraska  Institute  for  the  Deaf 
at  Omaha,  and  for  three  years  was  its  principal,  and  was  ex- 
officio  one  of  the  trustees. 


UE  COUitSKT  FRENCH. 


In  1885  I  obtained  the  necessary  legislation  to  establish  the 
Wyoming  School.  A  building  was  erected  by  the  Legislature 
in  1886,  but  owing  to  political  dissensions  no  means  have  as 
yet  been  provided  for  carrying  on  the  School. 

In  the  fall  of  1888  I  came  to  Dubuque,  Iowa,  and  opened 
the  "  Eastern  Iowa  School  for  the  Deaf,"  in  October  of  the 
same  year. 

The  School  has  been  supported  by  general  contributions, 
fairs  and  exhibitions.     Eooms  are  rented  and  furnished  for  the 


4  The  Eastern  Iowa  School. 

School.  It  is  carried  on  as  a  clay-school,  the  same  as  the 
hearing  schools.  During  the  past  four  years  eighteen  pupils 
have  been  in  attendance.  During  the  time  nearly  $3,000  has 
been  raised  for  the  benefit  of  the  School.  The  purpose  of  our 
work  is  to  secure  an  enactment  of  the  legislature  to  establish 
the  School  in  Eastern  Iowa,  and  make  provision  for  its  sup- 
port. The  Iowa  School  for  the  Deaf  at  CouncU  Bluffs  is  on 
the  western  border  of  the  State.  A  large  majority  of  the 
deaf  children  live  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  State.  Poverty 
prevents  many  from  going  so  far  away  to  school.  It  is  esti- 
mated that  there  are  about  two  thousand  deaf-mutes  in  the 
State,  half  of  whom  are  of  school  age. 

I  am  both  priacipal  and  teacher  of  this  School,  and  have 
been  ever  since  its  organization. 

Linnie  Haguewood,  a  deaf,  dumb,  and  blind  girl,  the  only 
one  in  Iowa,  has  been  connected  with  this  School.  She  learns 
through  the  sense  of  feeling  the  raised  letters  for  the  blind, 
spelling  on  the  fingers,  feeling  objects  and  speUing  their 
names.  She  is  now  thirteen  years  old,  and  if  her  education  is 
carried  on  she  will  become  very  intelligent  and  one  of  the  rare 
objects  of  the  School. 

The  study  hours  are  from  9  A.  M.  to  12  M.,  and  from  2  to 
4  P.  M.  The  School  session  extends  from  September  15  to 
June  12.      No  industries  are  taught  in  the  School  at  present.

THE  KINDEEGAETEN  AND  PEIMAEY  SCHOOL  FOE 
HEAEING  AND  DEAF  CHILDEEN,  WASHINGTON, 
D.  C. 

In  the  year  1883,  when  Dr.  A.  Graham  Bell  opened  his  ex- 
perimental private  school  for  very  young  deaf  children,  I  was 
a  teacher  in  Mrs.  Spier's  Kindergarten  for  hearing  children 
conducted  in  the  same  building,  No.  1234  Sixteenth  St.,  Scott 
Circle.  The  little  deaf  children  of  Dr.  Bell's  class  mingled 
freely  with  the  hearing  children  of  our  school  in  all  the  plays, 
most  of  the  exercises,  and  many  of  the  occupations  incident 


MISS  ANNA  SCHMITT. 


to  kindergarten  methods.  After  the  retirement  of  Miss  Ger- 
trude Hitz,  the  teacher  of  Dr.  Bell's  School,  I  participated 
more  actively  in  its  immediate  work,  occasionally  teaching  the 
deaf,  and  up  to  its  close  kept  the  records  and  took  charge  of 
the  lesson  papers,  all  of  which  have  been  carefully  preserved. 
I  closely  observed  Dr.  Bell  in  his  special  work  with  the  chil- 


4        Kindergarten  and  Primary  School  for  Hearing 

dren  at  the  time,  and,  furthermore,  had  the  good  fortune  to 
be  a  member  of  his  adult  or  parents'  class,  where  I  enjoyed 
the  advantage  of  gaining  valuable  information  relative  to  the 
theories  which  must  underlie  all  successful  articulation  work. 
The  instruction  of  little  deaf  children  in  speech  and  speech- 
reading  became  a  matter  of  absorbing  interest  to  me,  and 
hence,  when  Dr.  Bell  discontinued  his  experimental  class,  I 
determined  to  incorporate  his  ideas  of  teaching  very  young 
deaf  children  in  connection  with  hearing  children,  as  a  perma- 
nent and  integral  feature  of  the  Kindergarten,  which  I  have 
done  ever  since  January,  1888.  No  deaf  child  applying  to 
enter  my  Kindergarten,  numbering  from  twenty-five  to  thirty- 
five  pupils,  was  thereafter  denied  admission  on  account  of  its 
deafness,  and  I  have  had  as  many  as  three  such  children  at 
one  time  in  my  school.  Sometimes  there  has  been  only  one,  at 
other  times  none  at  all ;  but  the  school  has  at  no  time  been 
closed  to  them.  In  addition  to  this,  private  lessons  in  speech- 
reading  and  articulation,  which  I  had  previously  given  to  adult 
deaf,  were  continued. 

The  methods  pursued  in  teaching  speech  or  lip-reading  and 
articulation  to  these  little  children  were  identical  with  those 
an  intelligent  mother  employs  in  teaching  her  little  hearing 
child  to  talk.  This  I  term  the  "  Natural  Method,"  and  fol- 
lowing it  out  in  our  School  has  resulted  in  securing  well-mod- 
ulated sounds  from  our  little  deaf  wards  and  a  surprising 
expertness  in  speech-reading  on  their  part,  without  any  of  the 
drawbacks  which  enforced  unnatural  instruction  of  the  kind 
would  have  upon  very  young  children.  In  fact,  they  seemed 
to  enjoy  their  lessons  just  as  much  as  the  child  having  normal 
hearing.  It  is  true  such  procedure  demands  inexhaustible 
patience,  perseverance,  keen  perception  of  the  child's  capacity, 
and  a  close  analysis  of  the  means  to  be  employed  in  developing 
its  perceptive  faculties.  Our  invariable  rule  has  been  to  make 
no  distinction  whatever  between  the  deaf  and  hearing  children. 
When  speaking  to  the  former  we  use  the  same  provincialisms 
and  abbreviations  as  we  do  with  the  hearing,  so  that  the  eye 
of  the  deaf  child  may  catch  exactly  the  same  idea  which  im- 
presses itself  upon  the  hearing  child  through  its  ear.  To  find 
the  idiom  of  a  language  it  must  first  be  presented  to  the  child, 
and  to  use  it  correctly  it  must  be  understood.  We  have  found 
that  this  mode  of  proceeding  resulted  in  natural  forms  of 
speech  and   natural   intonation.      And  it   is   surprising  how 


and  Deaf  Children,  Washington,  D.  C.  5 

readily  some  deaf  children  can  acquire  this  unconstrained 
speech,  and  readiness  in  reading  speech  from  the  lips.  How 
readUy  they  detect  the  use  of  foreign  words,  for  instance,  and 
how  quick  they  will  be  in  correcting  the  pronunciation  of  their 
hearing  companions  !  I  will  state  a  recent  experience  which 
will  graphically  illustrate  and  practically  verify  my  attempt  to 
teach  acoordiag  to  the  "  Natural  Method." 

A  small  deaf  girl,  only  eight  years  of  age,  who  had  been 
under  instruction  only  a  few  weeks,  laughed  outright  when  a. 
little  hearing  companion  said  "  fee  "  for  "  three."  I  had  hardly 
noticed  the  mispronunciation,  and,  in  fact,  let  it  pass  uncor- 
rected, because  I  wanted  to  see  how  this  deaf  child  could  fol- 
low what  her  little  hearing  companion  said.  I  was  delighted 
to  observe  this  readiness  on  the  part  of  little  Helen  to  follow 
the  purport  of  the  little  boy's  talk  and  at  the  same  time  to  de- 
tect with  her  eye  an  inaccuracy  of  pronunciation  which  even 
he,  who  was  possessed  of  two  sound  ears,  failed  to  notice. 
Did  not  this  observant  little  speech-reader  (and  you  must 
admit  that  she  did  read  speech)  see  that  the  boy  gave  the 
sound  of  ./"for  that  of  th?  Did  she  not  see  and  read  what  I 
heard? 

A  school  of  this  character,  where  little  deaf  children  are 
taught  with  hearing  associates,  requires  teachers  to  be  spe- 
cially alert  in  laying  siege  to  every  impulse  and  desire  of  a  deaf 
child,  and  to  utilize  such  as  a  basis  upon  which  to  build  up 
articulation,  language,  and  speech-reading  work.  Were  the 
principle  which  prevails  in  this  School  followed  out  with  very 
young  deaf  children,  both  at  home  and  in  kindergartens,  the 
result  would  greatly  lighten  the  labors  of  future  teachers  of 
such  scholars,  vastly  facilitate  their  acquisition  of  knowledge, 
and  impart  a  joy  to  the  children  themselves  which  even  the 
delight  of  their  hearing  companions  could  not  excel. 

The  School  consists  of  two  subdivided  departments  and  one 
special  department : 

I.  Kindergarten.     Divisions  A  and  B. 
II.  Primary  or  advanced  class.     Divisions  A  and  B. 

III.  Special.     Articulation,  Speech-reading,  and  German. 

All  subjects  are  taught  by  the  natural  method,  teachers 
adapting  themselves  to  the  capacity  and  needs  of  the  pupils. 

The  curriculum  for  all  pupUs  in  the  Primary  or  Advanced 
Class,  whether  hearing  or  deaf,  embraces  the  English  ele- 
mentary branches,  as  follows : 


6      Kindergarten  and  Vrimary  School  for  Hearing,  etc. 

Heading :  By  sound  and  sight ;  the  constant  writing  of  what 
the  pupil  reads. 

'Writing :  Complete  thoughts.  Copying,  dictation,  with 
only  slight  exercises  in  the  forming  of  exact  letters  accordmg 
to  the  Spenoerian  system. 

Spelling :  Not  by  rote.  Sounding,  reading,  and  writing 
thereof.     Constructing  sentences  therewith. 

Arithmetic :  Oral  or  mental,  through  object  teaching. 
Practical,  including  all  the  functions,  slowly  taught. 

Geography :  Introduced  with  sand  mounds  or  a  sheet  of 
sand,  then  oral  work,  and  at  last  simple  descriptive  geogra- 
phies. 

History  :  Orally ;  later,  simple  stories. 

Natural  History :  All  branches  taught  naturally,  teacher 
only  using  text-books. 

Physiology  and  Physics :  With  the  two  foregoing  subjects, 
only  taught  elementarily. 

German  :  By  natural  method. 

Language  Lessons:  Grammar.  Word  analysis  in  simi^le 
forms. 

Drawing:  Kindergarten,  free-hand,  illustrative,  and  funda- 
mental geometrical  drawing. 

Music :  Vocal,  including  imitative  accurate  singing,  kinder- 
garten songs  and  games,  etc.,  being  led  by  adult  or  piano. 

Calisthenics  :  Breathing  exercises,  with  and  without  dumb- 
bells. 

In  the  month  of  January,  1893,  this  School  had  on  its  rolls 
twenty-two  hearing  children  and  one  deaf  child.  The  average 
attendance  during  the  past  four  and  a  half  years  has  been  31. 
Its  present  location  is  No.  220  E  street  N.W.  Its  corps  of 
teachers  consists  of  the  principal,  assisted  by  Miss  E.  F.  Bul- 
lard,  of  New  Orleans,  and  the  Misses  C.  C.  Stratton,  Emma 
Siebert,  and  Eleanora  Hines,  all  of  Washington,  at  present 
taking  a  special  course  of  Kindergarten  Normal  Training.

THE  ALBANY  HOME  SCHOOL  FOE  THE  ORAL 
INSTRUCTION  OF  THE  DEAF. 

The  Albany  Home  School  for  the  Oral  Instruction  of  the 
Deaf  being  one  of  the  youngest  schools  in  the  United  States, 
its  history  wUl  be  very  brief. 

It  was  organized  in  September,  1889,  in  a  very  modest  way, 
first  as  a  private  home  school,  where  the  deaf  of  Albany  and 
vicinity  could  be  orally  taught.  Very  soon  after  its  establish- 
ment, applications  were  made  from  other  States,  and  from 
parents  of  this  State  who  were  not  able  to  pay  tuition  but 
were  anxious  to  avail  themselves  of  the  School's  peculiar  privi-

leges  and  advantages  for  their  children.  It  was  deemed  best 
to  have  the  School  incorporated,  which  was  done  in  January, 
1891 ;  and  in  February,  1892,  we  succeeded  in  getting  a  bill 
passed  and  approved  amending  the  act  of  the  legislature  of 
the  State  of  New  York,  providing  for  the  care  and  education

of  the  deaf  under  twelve  years  of  age.  According  to  this 
amendment,  children  as  young  as  five  years  can  be  admitted 
to  any  one  of  eight  schools  in  Nevs^  York  State — that  of  Albany 
being  the  latest  incorporated — and  their  education  provided 
for  by  the  county  in  which  the  child  lives,  if  parents  are  unable 
to  afford  the  expense.  Thus  the  School  is  supported  by  tui- 
tion fees  and  county  appropriations. 

The  Home  School  began  with  two  little  boys  of  six  and 
seven  years  of  age,  and  an  older  sister,' not  deaf,  of  one  of  the 
boys,  as  a  companion.  The  older  boy  had  had  a  private  in- 
structor at  home  for  a  time  previous.  The  other  one  came 
fresh  to  the  work.  In  January  two  little  girls  of  four  and 
five  years  were  added  to  the  number.  In  the  spring  more 
ample  accommodations  were  secured,  and  another  little  boy 
of  eight  was  numbered  among  the  pupils.  Up  to  the  present 
time  there  have  been  sixteen  different  pupils  connected  with 
the  School,  besides  other  children  not  strictly  pupils.  One 
left  for  a  time  and  afterwards  returned.  A  girl  of  fourteen, 
who  had  attended  one  of  the  large  schools,  and  been  taught 
by  signs,  came  to  the  School  for  several  weeks,  and  had  made 
some  advancement  in  speaking,  became  discouraged,  and 
longing  for  the  old  associates  and  easier  method  of  express- 
ing herself,  her  parents  yielded  to  her  entreaties  and  allowed 
her  to  return  to  her  former  surroundings. 

A  young  man,  having  a  serious  impediment  of  speech, 
attended  for  lessons  in  articulation  and  enunciation.  After 
three  months  of  daily  lessons  and  practice,  he  found  himself 
greatly  benefited  by  the  exercises  similar  to  those  given  to 
deaf  people  through  the  laborious  process  of  speech-reading. 
One  boy,  now  eleven  years  of  age,  has  been  in  attendance  at 
the  Albany  Academy,  and  his  teacher  reports  : 

I  hardly  know  how  to  express  my  growing  surprise  as  the  months 
haye  passed  away.  When  he  eame  to  me,  I  was  filled  with  wonder 
when  I  saw  what  he  had  accomplished  in  spite  of  his  limitations.  Com- 
paring him  with  other  boys  of  his  age,  he  stood  well,  but  the  best  test 
of  your  work,  to  my  mind,  has  not  been  what  he  accomplished  while 
directly  under  your  care,  but  what  that  training  enabled  him  to  do 
when  put  into  a  regular  school  fur  hearing  boys.  He  has  not  failed  as 
the  year  has  grown,  and  now  stands  among  the  first  in  his  class  in  read- 
ing, spelling,  and  language  work.  In  arithmetic  also  he  ranks  well.  In 
history  and  geography  he  does  not  do  as  well,  because,  of  course,  he 
has  not  learned  to  talk  as  fluently  as  is  necessary  in  a  topical  recitation. 
All  this  work  done  in  the  midst  of  boys  who  can  hear,  and  in  a  school 
where  there  cannot  be  much  individual  work,  speaks  a  stronger  word 


The  Albany  Home  School.  5 

for  your  work  than  any  I  could  utter.  Of  one  thing  I  am  sure  :  unless 
he  had  had  most  careful  training  with  you,  it  would  have  been  utterly 
impossible  for  him  to  have  done  this  work.  As  far  as  my  opinion  of 
your  work  goes,  I  can  say  this  :  When  any  one  sees  one  of  these  afflicted, 
children  talking,  playing,  working  so  happily  in  the  midst  of  their  more 
fortunate  brothers  and  sisters,  how  can  one  speak  any  but  the  very 
highest  words  of  praise  in  favor  of  the  training  which  alone  produces 
such  results. 

And  now  I  shall  have  to  record  one  saddening  circumstance 
that  occurred  in  January,  1893.  After  a  Christmas  merry- 
making, to  which  the  relatives  of  the  children  and  friends  of

the  School  contributed,  School  closed  for  a  holiday  of  ten  days 
and  the  children  living  near  were  taken  home  for  a  time. 
During  that  time  one  of  the  pupils,  a  bright,  beautiful  little 
gill  of  eight  years  of  age,  was  taken  sick  at  her  home  and  died 
after  a  few  days'  illness  of  pneumonia.  While  our  hearts  are 
sad  because  we  miss  the  bright,  attractive  presence  of  one  of 
our  most  intelligent  pupils,  an^  member  of  our  household, 
we  feel  that  "  it  is  well  with  the  child,"  especially  as  the  mother 
was  also  taken  away  a  few  days  later  by  the  same  disease. 

In  the  Albany  Home  School  for  the  Oral  Instruction  of  the 
Deaf,  totally  or  partially  deaf  children  who  have  never  talked 
are  taught  to  articulate  by  speech^reading.  Speech-reading  is 
taught  those  who  have  lost  their  hearing,  either  wholly  or  par- 
tially, after  learning  to  talk,  to  enable  them  to  understand 
others  without  the  use  of  signs  or  the  manual  alphabet.  The 
higher  education  of  these  children  is  conducted  by  means  of 
speech,  or  what  is  called  the  oral  method,  in  much  the  same 
manner  as  in  schools  for  hearing  children.  The  elements  of 
language  are  first  taught,  then  combinations  of  elements,  then 
words. 

Speech  reading  is  an  invaluable  acquisition  for  adults  who 
have  become  deaf,  or  whose  hearing  is  impaired  to  such  a 
degree  that  they  cannot  understand  ordinary  conversation. 

A  course  of  training  has  been  arranged  to  prepare  oral 
teachers  of  the  deaf. 

Although  arrangements  have  been  made  for  the  admission 
and  education,  by  appointment  from  the  counties,  of  a  limited 
number  of  children  whose  parents  are  unable  to  pay  for  then- 
education,  it  does  not  interfere  with  the  special  character  of 
the  School — its  home-like  and  refining  influences  and  associa- 
tions more  readily  obtainable  in  a  select  school.  "While  the 
good  work  done  at  the  large  or  State  schools  cannot  be  esti- 
mated, it  is  thought  that  the  younger  children  can  be  better 
trained  in  such  a  school  as  this.  As  the  name  implies,  it  is  a 
Home  School,  where  children  can  be  received  at  an  earlier  age 
than  the  regulations  of  the  larger  schools  will  permit,  and  have 
the  care  and  family  associations  and  privileges  which  are  often 
lacking  in  institution  life,  and  which  young  children  require  for 
their  proper  development,  physically,  morally,  and  intellectually. 
The  value  of  this  will  be  seen  when  it  is  stated  that  it  is  of  the 
greatest  importance,  in  order  to  achieve  the  best  results,  to 
begin  the  instruction  of  the  little  ones  in  articulation  as  near 


The  Albany  Hoine  School.  7 

as  possible  at  the  age  when  a  hearing  child  learns  to  talk. 
According  to  a  simple  and  self-evident  law  of  nature,  an  organ 
or  set  of  organs  of  a  living  body, when  not  applied  for  its  legiti- 
mate function,  will  become  inflexible  and  immobile  from  non- 
use,  or  deformed  from  misuse.  It  is  so  with  the  vocal  cords  or 
organs  of  speech.  If  left  for  eight  or  ten  or  more  years  with- 
out use  for  the  purposes  of  speech,  the  child  will  lose  command 
of  them  entirely,  or  form  habits  of  discordant,  harsh,  and  mo- 
notonous utterance,  not  observable  by  the  deaf,  but  disagree- 
able to  all  hearing  people. 

A  parent  will  be  amply  repaid  for  sending  a  child  to  an  oral 
school  as  young  as  three  or  four  years,  even  at  some  incon- 
venience. If  a  hearing  child,  after  having  learned  to  talk,  has 
been  made  deaf  by  disease,  he  should,  immediately  upon  his 
recovery,  be  sent  to  a  school  where  his  speech  will  be  retained 
and  where  he  will  be  taught  to  understand  from  the  lips.  In 
such  cases  it  is  common  to  delay  so  long  that  serious  loss  of 
speech  results.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to  encourage  the 
child  to  retain  the  use  of  his  voice,  and  to  pronounce  common 
words  by  watching  the  lip  motions  and  facial  expression,  or 
by  feeling  the  muscular  action  or  the  breath. 

I  will  repeat  here  a  paragraph  taken  from  a  former  report. 
It  has  been  asserted  by  some  of  our  educators  who  advocate 
the  use  of  signs  for  teaching  the  deaf,  that  persons^bf  intelli- 
gence and  education  acquire  the  art  of  speech-reading  with 
comparative  ease,  and  that  those  taught  by  the  "  eclectic " 
system  become  better  speech  readers  and  more  fluent  articu- 
lators than  those  taught  exclusively  by  the  oral  system.  For 
this  reason  the  mind  of  the  deaf  child  just  beginning  to  learn 
should  first  and  all  along  be  disciplined  and  informed  by  means 
of  the  manual  signs.  This  is  said  to  prepare  the  way  and  ren- 
der easier  the  teaching  of  speech  and  speech-reading.  This  is 
not  my  experience  nor  the  experience  of  those  who  have  been  a 
much  longer  time  in  this  work  than  I.  First,  in  regard  to 
laying  the  foundation,  I  prefer  to  start  with  the  speech 
movement  of  the  vocal  organs — call  them  facial  signs,  if  you 
wiU.  I  have  no  special  objection  to  that  word  in  its  general 
sense.  For,  while  it  is  true  that  context  is  one  of  the  keys  to 
speech-reading,  stiU  it  is  mainly  built  on  a  cultivated  habit  of 
perception  and  accurate  observation.  The  eyes  are  trained  to 
detect  the  slightest  and  most  delicate  shades  and  variations  in 
tlie  muscular  action  and  expression  of  the  vocal  and  facial 


8  The  Albany  Home  School. 

organs  which  mean  words,  and  words  mean  ideas.  No  time  is 
better  to  begin  to  train  into  this  habit  of  nice  observation  than 
very  early  childhood.  What  does  all  our  system  of  kinder- 
garten and  object  and  illustrative  teaching  mean  if  it  does  not 
mean  just  this  %  Teach  a  child  two  ways  of  doing  a  thing — 
manaal  signs  and  lip  signs — and  he  will  not  select  and  adopt 
that  which  will  be  of  the  most  benefit  to  him — speech — but  he 
will  choose  the  easier,  at  the  loss  of  all  the  facility  he  would 
obtain  by  the  persistent,  constant,  and  exclusive  practice  of 
the  other.  Just  as  wise,  I  think,  are  those  parents  who  do  not 
take  their  children  to  any  particular  church,  or  teach  them  the 
moral  right  or  wrong  of  any  course  of  action,  leaving  them  to 
choose  as  the  conscience  or  intuition  indicates  as  they  grow 
older.  The  trouble  is  that,  when  it  comes  to  selecting  for 
themselves,  the  conscience  itself,  by  which  they  could  be 
guided,  seems  to  be  lacking,  and  the  intuition  left  to  run  riot 
will  do  so  still.  The  ability  to  choose  wisely  belongs  to  "those 
who,  by  reason  of  use,  have  their  senses  exercised  to  discern 
both  good  and  evil." 

I  have  given  lessons  in  speech-reading  to  a  number  of  adults, 
intellectual  and  well-informed  people,  who  had  become  par- 
tially deaf.  The  few  who  persevered  against  all  obstacles  and 
difficulties,  acquiring  a  facility  in  the  art,  have  told  me,  time 
and  time  again,  that  it  was  the  most  difficult  thing  they  ever 
tried  to  learn,  and  their  great  regret  has  always  been  that  they 
had  the  habits  of  years  to  contend  against,  always  exclaiming, 
"  If  I  were  only  younger,  I  know  I  could  learn  this  so  much 
easier !  "  More  give  it  up  in  disgust  or  despair  than  persevere. 
Is  it  strange  when  so  few  adults  undertake  any  new  acquisi- 
tion or  accomplishment  which  requires  indomitable  and  long 
continued  practice "? 

In  1892  the  School  was  removed  to  the  beautiful  and  health- 
ful suburb  of  Pine  Hills,  in  the  western  part  of  the  city.  The 
house,  originally  a  roomy  farm-house,  has  been  renovated  and 
refitted,  with  wide  verandas  and  ample,  cheerful,  and  whole- 
some accommodations,  good  system  of  drainage,  city  water 
supply,  and  electric  lights.  The  building  stands  high,  on  a  ter- 
race, with  wide  spreading  lawn  and  a  variety  of  beautiful  old 
trees  that  render  it  very  attractive  and  home-like. 

A  kindergarten  of  day-pupils,  composed  of  the  neighbor- 
hood hearing  children,  in  which  the  deaf  children  have  some 
exercises  every  day  with  the  hearing  children,  has  been  added 
to  the  School. 


The  Albany  Home  School.  9 

Next  June,  1893,  closes  the  fourth  year  of  the  Albany  Home 
School  for  the  Oral  Instruction  of  the  Deaf.  One  teacher, 
Miss  Carrie  Marvin,  was  trained  here  and  served  for  two  years, 
and  now  occupies  a  similar  position,  having  charge  of  an  oral 
class  in  the  State  school  of  Indiana,  and  is  believed  to  be  doing 
some  excellent  work  there  in  teaching  the  deaf  to  speak.  One 
boy  has  been  prepared  to  enter  an  academy  with  hearing  boys, 
where  he  is  making  excellent  progress.  One  young  man  hav- 
ing an  impediment  in  his  speech  has  been  greatly  benefited. 
Three  teachers  are  now  connected  with  the  School  in  training 
and  as  assistants.  The  pupils  now  in  school  are  exceptionally 
intelligent  and  attractive  children,  and  very  busy,  orderly,  and 
happy  at  their  work  or  recreation  in  their  school  and  home 
life,  yielding  cheerful  obedience  to  their  teachers  and  the 
regulations  of  the  School,  and  it  is  especially  gratifying  to  be 
able  to  state  that  the  School  has  gone  forward  steadily  and 
successfully  during  the  period  covered  by  this  little  history. 
The  remarkable  rollicking  healthfulness  of  the  children  has 
very  often  been  the  occasion  of  notice  and  comment  by  those 
interested  and  visitors.  This  has  been  mainly  due  to  regular 
habits  and  plenty  of  sleep  and  out-of-door  exercise.

NOTEE  DAME  FEMALE  SCHOOL  FOE  THE  DEAF. 

About  twelve  years  ago  several  Catholic  adult  deaf-mutes 
from  different  institutes  applied  to  us  for  religious  instruction. 
This  was  given  at  first  by  means  of  writing  and  the  manual 
alphabet.  However,  finding  this  method  insufficient  to  accom- 
plish the  desired  object,  namely,  the  thorough  instruction  in 
Christian  doctrine,  we  studied  the  English  order  of  signs, 
which  we  have  continued  to  use  with  persons  who  have  been 
educated  by  the  manual  method. 

Ll  1890,  at  the  earnest  request  of  Archbishop  Elder  and  some 
of  the  reverend  clergy,  we  opened  a  gratuitous  day-school  for 
female  deaf  children  in  which  the  oral  method  is  pursued  as 
much  as  possible.  The  branches  taught  are  language,  com- 
position, history,  geography,  arithmetic,  penmanship,  drawing, 
and  needlework.  The  number  of  pupils  attending  at  present 
is  twelve.  This  School  is  connected  with  the  Academy  of  the 
Convent  of  Notre  Dame  on  Sixth  street.

THE  DEAF-MUTE  INSTITUTION  OF  THE  HOLY 
EOSAEY. 

The  Deaf-Mute  Institution  of  Rosary  Solitude  is  beautifully- 
situated  in  one  of  the  healthiest  localities  of  Louisiana,  in  a 
pretty  rural  district  called  Chinch  uba,  county  of  St.  Tam- 
many. It  is  about  thirty  miles  northeast  from  New  Orleans, 
and  occupies  a  beautiful  site  in  the  heart  of  the  "Piney 
Woods,"  which  rank  among  the  healthiest  in  the  South,  is 
favored  with  rich  productive  soil,  surrounded  with  magnificent

woods  and  glades  that  abound  in  mineral  springs,  which  have , 
been  utilized  through  artesian  bores,  that  yield  sixty  or  eighty 
gallons  a  minute. 

This  house  of  charity  is  the  first  Catholic  institution  of  its 
kind  in  the  South,  and  by  its  erection  a  long-felt  want  has 
been  supplied,  and  the  hearts  of  Catholic  parents,  who  here- 
tofore were  either  obliged  to  keep  their  poor  unfortunate  little

ones  at  home  and  let  them  grow  up  in  ignorance,  or  else  send 
them  to  an  institution  in  which  they  receive  no  knowledge  of 
our  holy  faith,  were  gladdened,  as  now  an  opportunity  was 
afforded  them  to  give  their  deaf-mute  children  a  religious 
education  as  well  as  their  speaking  and  hearing  children. 

The  founder  of  this  valuable  Institution  is  the  Very  Eev. 
Canon  Mignot,  who  with  untiring  zeal  devotes  a  large  portion 
of  his  time  as  well  as  his  means  to  the  service  of  this  afflicted 
portion  of  Christ's  suffering  poor.  With  the  approval,  bless- 
ing, and  hearty  cooperation  of  His  Grace,  Most  Rev.  F.  Jans- 
sens,  Archbishop  of  New  Orleans,  the  Institution  was  opened 
for  the  reception  of  pupils  on  the  the  1st  of  October,  1890,  in 
the  building  hitherto  known  as  "Kildara  House"  at  Chin- 
chuba,  and  the  management  thereof  confided  to  the  Dominican 
nuns,  who  since  1846  have  conducted  some  of  the  ablest  insti- 
tutions of  the  kind  in  Europe  and  Australia,  and  who  thus 
brought  to  their  work  not  alone  knowledge  as  teachers,  but 
also  technical  experience  that  only  constant  intercourse  with 
deaf-mutes  can  ensure. 

The  secular  system  of  instruction  adopted  by  the  nuns  con- 
forms to  that  employed  by  the  leading  institutions  of  America. 
It  imparts  a  thorough  knowledge  of  language,  while  it  avoids 
all  abstruse,  complicated  forms  that  serve  only  to  embarrass 
deaf-mute  students  and  to  retard  the  progress  they  are  re- 
quired to  make  in  each  grade  or  class. 

The  domestic  industrial  arts  and  trades  which  form  the 
circle  of  duties  marked  out  for  men  and  women  of  the  world 
have  their  place  in  the  curriculum  drawn  up  for  Chinchuba, 
and  in  due  time  the  Institution,  which  is  as  yet  in  its  infancy, 
will  also  have  a  bakery,  shoe-  and  tailor-shop,  printing  and 
other  work-rooms,  where  those  branches  can  be  studied  with 
much  profit  and  success. 

Religious  instruction  and  moral  training  form  the  most 
important  and  difficult  parts  of  the  deaf-mutes'  education,  yet 
it  is  the  accomplishment  of  these  grand  ends  the  nuns  pur- 
pose to  attain  in  the  work  of  charity  God  has  committed  to  ' 
their  care.  The  Catholic  religion  alone  is  taught,  but  aU  sects 
are  received  and  their  religious  opinions  respected. 

The  original  building  of  the  Institution  soon  became  too 
small  to  accommodate  both  the  boys  and  girls,  and  therefore 
a  new  structure  was  erected  at  a  little  distance  from  the  old 
house,  and  27  children — 15  boys  and  12  girls — are  at  present 


Institution  of  the  Holy  Rosary.  5 

lodged  and  provided  for  under  the  sheltering  roof  of  Rosary 
Solitude.  Improvements  are  still  being  made.  Girls  of  all 
ages  are  admitted  and  boys  under  the  age  of  fifteen  years. 
Pupils  receive  board  and  tuition  free  of  charge,  and  the  most 
advanced  and  perfected  methods  are  resorted  to  for  their  in- 
struction. The  "  Audig^ne,"  invented  by  Monsignor  Verrier  in 
France,  as  applied  at  Chinchuba,  has,  so  far,  yielded  most  en- 
couraging results.  Its  reputation  is  now  firmly  established 
in  France,  vp^here  it  has  not  only  lent  a  most  valuable  assist- 
ance to  the  oral  method,  but  has  also,  in  some  cases,  proved  a 
curative  agent. 

Since  last  September  the  sisters  of  Notre  Dame  have  taken 
charge  of  the  Institution  and  have  been  very  successful  in 
their  endeavors.  They  not  only  teach  religion  and  bring 
up  the  children  confided  to  their  care  in  good  morals,  but  also 
give  them  a  thorough  education  in  teaching  them  a  trade  so 
they  may  be  able  to  become  good  and  useful  citizens.

1890-1893. 


By  LILLIE  EGINTON  WARREN, 

Principal  of  the  School. 


THE  WAREEN  ARTICULATION  SCHOOL. 

The  Warren  Articulation  School  was  opened  in  October, 
1890.  It  grew  out  of  an  increased  number  of  private  pupils 
under  Miss  Warren.  The  aim  of  the  School  is  to  develop  the 
voice  and  give  as  exact  articulation  as  possible.  Children  are 
admitted  at  the  age  of  three  years  and  even  younger.  Lessons 
of  balf  an  hour  daily  or  every  other  day  are  given  first,  and  the 
time  is  gradually  lengthened. 

Six  pupils  form  a  morning  class,  with  a  session  of  three 
hours,  from  9.30  to  12.30.  Each  pupil  receives  as  much  indi- 
vidual attention  as  would  be  given  by  a  visiting  governess, 
while  the  presence  of  other  scholars  imparts  a  wholesome 
stimulus,  in  no  other  way  obtainable.  All  the  pupils  have 
special  vocal  and  articulative  exercises  daily  to  give  inflexions  to 
the  voice  and  ease  of  movement  to  the  organs  of  speech.  The 
effort  is  made  to  forget  the  pupUs  are  deaf,  with  the  view  of 
making  them  appear  as  much  as  possible  Hke  hearing  children. 

All  the  work  of  the  School  is  based  on  Bell's  Visible  Speech. 
The  symbols  are  used  with  the  pupil  from  the  first ;  as  soon 
as  possible  the  ordinary  letters  are  introduced,  and  the  symbols 
employed  solely  for  correcting  the  articulation  and  for  vocal 
exercises.     The  manual  alphabet  is  not  used. 

Private  instruction  is  given  to  adults  who  have  become 
more  or  less  deaf,  and  to  hearing  adults  and  children  who 
stammer,  stutter,  lisp,  nasalize,  or  possess  other  defects  in 
speech. 

Aural  instruction  receives  attention  in  this  School,  efforts 
being  made  first  with  whistles,  bells,  the  clapping  of  hands, 
and  other  noises.  The  following  report  of  cases  to  June,  1892. 
is  taken  from  an  article  in  the  New  York  Medical  Record, 
October  22, 1892.  During  the  year  1892-'3  the  same  aural  drill 
is  continued,  with  pleasing  results. 

Case  I. — A  boy  who,  at  four  years  of  age,  after  continued  efforts  to 
call  h-is  attention  to  sounds,  began  to  notice  the  clapping  of  bands, 
whistling,  and  a  trumpet.  At  the  end  of  seven  months'  daily  drill  he 
hears  a  bell,  the  hand-organ,  a  canary's  song,  and  the  barking  of  a  dog. 


4  The  Warren  Articulation  School. 

He  eviufes  much  pleasure  at  singing  when  near,  and  turns  quickly  at 
the  sound  of  a  whistle  in  an  adjoining  room,  behind  closed  doors.  He 
can  repeat  readily  a  number  of  words  when  spoken  near  either  ear,  or  at 
a  distance  of  a  few  inches  in  loud  or  low  voice.  Some  of  the  words  have 
breath  sounds,  as  papa,  ship,  whip,  shoe,  flower,  and  up. 

Case  II. —A  girl,  ten  years  of  age.  She  had  no  perception  of  sound 
until  last  December.  At  the  end  of  five  months  she  can  hear  and  repeat 
a  number  of  words ;  she  can  distinguish  and  give  high  and  low  notes 
very  well.  When  standing  outside  of  a  room  with  doord  closed,  she  can 
tell  when  the  piano  accompanies  singing  and  when  the  instrument  only 
is  heard. 

Case  III.  — A  girl,  four  years  of  age.  Last  October,  when  I  saw  her 
first,  she  noticed  the  ticking  of  a  watch  and  heard  the  music-box  and 
whistle.  She  made  no  attempt  to  repeat  the  sound  of  the  voice,  and 
could  not  locate  noises.  At  the  end  of  six  months'  instruction  she  can 
determine  the  source  of  sounds,  and  has  learned  people  and  objects  have 
names.  She  can  repeat  readily  and  distinctly  a  number  of  words  when 
spoken  a  short  distance  from  her  ears,  as  boy,  sew,  ball,  bell,  doll,  and 
mouth.     She  has  learned  to  repeat  a  little  sentence,  as  "  I  see  baby." 

Case  IV. — A  boy,  ten  years  of  age.  When  three  years  old,  after  con- 
tinued practice,  he  could  repeat  a  few  words  heard  through  a  double 
speaking-tube.  At  five  years  he  could  distinguish  about  thirty  words, 
if  spoken  slowly  and  very  distinctly,  but  he  became  confused  if  two  or 
more  were  repeated  making  a  sentence.  When  nearly  ten  his  hearing 
of  speech  had  not  improved  to  any  extent,  but  he  would  turn  quickly  at 
the  sound  of  whistles  and  bells.  After  the  past  seven  months'  careful 
work,  he  can  recognize  familiar  words  when  spoken  at  a  distance  of  six 
feet,  and  begins  to  notice  what  people  say  in  the  horse-car  and  other 
places.  He  understands  and  answers  questions  spoken  some  inches 
from  his  ear,  and  in  his  reading-lesson  his  pronunciation  can  be  cor- 
rected through  his  hearing  alone. 

Case  V. — A  girl,  five  years  of  age.  When  four  she  was  considered 
wholly  deaf.  As  her  parents  live  a  long  distance  from  the  city,  her  in- 
struction has  been  carried  on  for  a  few  months  only  at  a  time ;  enough 
has  been  gained,  however,  for  home  training  to  be  possible.  The  child 
awoke  gradually  to  an  enjoyment  of  many  sounds.  Within  fourteen 
months  of  her  first  lesson  she  has  acquired  quite  a  vocabulary,  and  has 
learned  a  number  of  sentences.  She  expresses  herself  by  these  words 
at  all  times,  and  uses  the  sentences  properly.  She  has  begun  to  answer 
questions,  having  at  first  merely  repeated  them. 

It  will  be  seen  from  the  above  that  various  noises  are  recognized  and 
enjoyed  before  the  human  voice  is  noticed ;  the  power  to  determine  the 
source  of  these  sounds  grows  by  constant  practice ;  words  are  heard 
for  a  while  when  spoken  near  the  ear,  their  familiarity  admitting  of 
longer  distance  later ;  a  memorizing  of  these  words  finally  takes  place  ; 
and  even  after  they  are  first  heard  and  repeated  there  is  still  a  noticeable 
slowness,  which  is  overcome  gradually.  How  gradually  can  be  appreci- 
ated by  those  only  who  have  daily  led  the  pupil  step  by  step,  against  his 
will,  through  the  early  difBculties  of  learning  to  listen.

THE  HOME  FOE  THE  TEAINING  IN  SPEECH  OF 
DEAF  CHILDREN  BEFORE  THEY  ARE  OF 
SCHOOL  AGE. 

In  May,  1891,  Senator  J.  B.  Showalter,  at  the  request  of  Miss 
Emma  Garrett,  then  principal  of  the  Pennsylvania  Oral  School 
for  the  Deaf  at  Scranton,  introduced  a  bill  into  the  Pennsyl- 
vania legislature  asking  for  an  appropriation  of  $15,000  for  the 
building  of  a  "  Home  for  the  training  in  speech  of  deaf  chil- 
dren before  they  are  of  school  age."  Dr.  Thomas  May  Pierce, 
of  the  Business  College  of  Philadelphia,  had  strongly  urged 
this  as  the  best  way  of  obtaining  the  pecuniary  support  Miss 


MISS  EMMA  GAREETT. 


Garrett  desired.  The  bill  received  hearty  support  from  all 
over  the  State,  and  was  passed.  The  sum  being  found  insuffi- 
cient to  purchase  desirable  land,  some  delays  occurred. 
Finally,  Col.  Joseph  M.  Bennett  generously  presented  the 
Commission,  consisting  of  Governor  Pattison,  Lieut.-Governor 
Watres,  Auditor-General   Gregg,    S.    Edwin   Megargee,   and

ment avenues,  just  beyond  the  Philadelphia  Park,  where  a  fine 
building  on  the  cottage  plan  is  in  process  of  erection. 

A  number  of  little  ones  were  awaiting  admission  into  the 
"Home,"  and  Col.  Bennett  loaned  the  old  buildings  of  the 
Methodist  Orphanage  as  temporary  quarters.  The  work  of  the 
"  Home  "  began  there  on  February  1,  1892,  and  has  been  car- 
ried on  with  great  success  with  funds  raised  by  the  Misses 
Garrett. 

The  enterprise  has  been  aided  in  various  ways  by  the  State 
Board  of  Charities,  the  management  of  the  Pennsylvania  Oral 
School  for  the  Deaf  at  Scranton,  and  the  Western  Pennsylvania 
Institution  for  the  Deaf  at  Pittsburg,  Mr.  Talcott  Williams,  of

In  the  first  report  of  the  Home,  published  in  1892,  the 
managers  speak  as  follows  of  the  principal : 

Miss  Emma  Garret,  the  principal  and  founder  of  the  Home,  comes  to 
this  work  with  a  ripe  experience.  In  the  winter  of  1877-'78  she  studied 
in  the  School  of  Vocal  Physiology  in  Boston  (then  one  of  the  schools  of 
the  Boston  University),  under  Professor  A.  Graham  Bell,  the  mechanism 
of  speech  and  the  teaching  of  speech  to  the  deaf,  and  graduated  No.  1 
in  a  class  of  twenty-one.  She  has  ever  since  been  laboring  to  have  all 
deaf  children  given  the  opportunity  to  learn  speech  and  lip-reading.  In 
1882  she  read  a  paper  before  a  convention  of  teachers  of  the  deaf,  held 
at  Jacksonville,  111.,  entitled  "  A  Plea  that  the  Deaf  of  America  be 
Taught  to  Use  Their  Voices." 

In  September,  1878,  she  went  to  the  Pennsylvania  Institution  for  the 
Deaf  and  Dumb  at  Philadelphia,  to  teach  articulation  as  it  was  then 
taught  there — a  daily  half-hour  drill  to  selected  pupils,  who  received  all 


Pennsylvania  Home  for  Training  in  Speech.  7 

their  education  through  the  manual  alphabet  and  signs.  In  1881,  in 
response  to  her  urgent  requests,  aided  by  encouraging  words  from  Mr. 
Charles  C.  Harrison,  then  one  of  the  directors  of  that  Institution,  she 
•was  permitted  to  take  charge  of  a  branch  for  oral  instruction  where  the 
pupils  should  be  educated  entirely  through  the  acquired  speech  and  lip- 
reading.  She  began  in  two  rooms  at  Seventeenth  and  Chestnut  streets 
with  eighteen  pupils,  and  in  two  and  a  half  years  had  gathered  seventy- 
six,  the  school  being  meanwhile  transferred  to  a  house  at  Eleventh  and 
Clinton  streets,  Philadelphia.  In  her  report  for  March,  1882,  Miss  Gar- 
rett earnestly  requested  that  all  new  pupils  taken  into  the  Institution 
should  be  taught  by  the  oral  method.  In  1881,  at  the  request  of  Mr. 
Henry  Belin,  Jr.,  Judge  Hand,  and  other  philanthropic  men  of  Scranton, 
who  were  anxious  to  provide  an  education  for  the  large  proportion  of 
deaf  in  that  locality,  Miss  Emma  Garrett  went  to  Scranton  to  establish 
the  Pennsylvania  Oral  School  for  the  Deaf.  She  remained  principal  of 
the  Institution  for  seven  years,  until  1891,  during  which  time,  the  building 
provided  by  the  State  being  filled  to  overflowing,  a  second  building  was 
made  necessary,  and  is  now  being  erected. 

In  1889  this  school  received  a  medal  from  the  Paris  Exposition.  In 
1890  Miss  Garrett  visited  the  oral  schools  for  the  deaf  in  seven  countries 
of  Europe.  In  1891  she,  with  great  regret,  resigned  her  position  at 
Scranton  to  found  the  present  Home,  feeling  that  to  be  her  next  duty. 

By  the  intelligent  co-operation  of  our  two  assistants,  Miss 
Anna  C.  Reinhardt  and  Miss  Elizabeth  I.  Fowler  (who  were 
trained  by  ourselves),  and  by  the  support  of  the  Board  of  Di- 
rectors, the  first  year  of  the  work  in  our  Home  has  been  little 
short  of  ideal.  We  shall  enter  our  comfortable  new  building, 
surrounded  with  fine  old  trees,  in  the  summer  of  1893.  It  is 
very  near  our  present  temporary  quarters,  but  "  every  build- 
ing clothes  itself  with  the  poetry  of  human  life,  bringing  into 
visibility  different  human  relations,"  and  our  thoughts  will 
often  revert  to  the  happy  year  spent  here. 

We  began  work  in  temporary  quarters  on  Monument  ave- 
nue, near  Ford  road,  Philadelphia,  February  1, 1892,  and  had 
fifteen  little  ones  within  a  week  after.  We  have  since  had  an 
average  attendance  of  eighteen  pupils. 

The  most  advanced  pupils  entered  at  varying  times  between 
February  1  and  April  25.  They  were  all  either  born  deaf  or  lost 
hearing  before  acquiring  speech  ;  therefore,  they  represent 
the  most  afHicted  class  of  the  deaf. 

I  can  only  say  of  these  pupils  that  many  of  them  are  now 
chatterboxes— not  perfect  in  speech  yet,  but  they  give  spon- 
taneous expression  in  speech  to  most  of  their  childish  emo- 
tions. They  speak  hundreds  of  words,  and  understand  many 
more  on  the  lips.  Their  lip-reading  is  so  true  that  they  very 
readily  learn  a  new  word.     They  are  always  addressed  in  rapid

speech,  and  therefore  read  the  lips  quickly  when  spoken  to 
naturally  and  in  language  within  their  vocabulary. 

From  the  time  we  bid  them  "  Good  morning,"  when  they 
knock  at  our  doors  as  they  pass  our  rooms,  until  the  "  Good 
night  "  before  going  to  bed,  they  are  constantly  being  talked 
to  as  hearing  children  are.  At  breakfast  they  ask,  "  Give  me 
some  oatmeal,  or  biscuit,  mUk,  sugar,  butter,  bread,  potato, 
mush,  orange,"  or  whatever  there  may  be  for  that  meal,  and 
understand  when  asked  to  pass  any  of  these  articles  to  the 
person  named,  and  when  they  are  to  thank  and  when  to  be 
thanked.  A  little  girl,  who  came  to  us  in  a  very  delicate  con- 
dition, is  given  cream,  and  they  understand  it  is  "  because 
Frederika  is  thia,"  and  that  we  want  to  make  her  fat.  They 
understand  the  difference  between  some  and  a  or  an —  for  ex- 
ample, some  potato,  a  potato.  They  know  the  name  of  every- 
thing pertaining  to  the  table  furniture — table,  table-cloth, 
napkin,  bib,  tray,  knife,  fork,  spoon  (large  and  small). 

They  have  been  taught  to  eat  as  people  in  our  best  circles 
do,  and  it  has  become  a  habit  with  them.  They  would  under- 
stand if  asked  to  "  change  seats  "  with  any  one  at  the  table. 
If  we  omit  to  help  them,  they  remind  us,  "  You  forgot,"  etc., 
and  look  for  the  "  I'm  sorry "  in  reply.  They  understand 
when  asked  if  they  like  certain  articles  of  food,  though  we 
try  to  train  them  to  eat  all  good  things  in  moderation.  They 
converse  in  their  childish  way  at  the  table  with  each  other  ; 
occasionally,  when  a  little  teasing  is  going  on,  we  hear  the  cry, 
"  Stop  !  "  This  is  not  very  frequent,  however,  as  they  are 
taught  to  be  loving  and  considerate  of  others. 

They  understand  when  told  to  put  on  their  hats,  coats,  and 
overshoes  to  go  out  at  what  we  call  "  physical-exercise  periods.'' 
They  understand  the  direction  to  walk,  walk  softly,  slowly, 
fast. 

They  use  their  speech  to  each  other  as  far  as  it  goes,  and 
occasionally  electrify  us  by  such  directions  to  each  other  as 
"  Wipe  your  nose."  They  say,  "  Be  careful,"  "After  while," 
"  Never  mind,"  etc.  A  teacher  asked  a  little  girl,  who  was 
spreading  her  bread  with  some  difficulty,  to  pass  her  the  bread  ; 
she  replied,  "  After  while."  She  did  not  mean  to  be  rude,  but 
she  had  noticed  that  when  her  teacher  was  engaged  she  had 
promised  to  give  attention  to  certain  things  "After  a  while," 
and  she  onlj''  meant  she  would  pass  the  bread  as  soon  as  she 
was  through  the  work  in  hand — viz.,  spreading  her  bread. 
Very  recently  their  attention  was  directed  to  the  difference 


10        Pennsylvania  Home  for  Training  in  Speech. 

between  youth  and  old  age,  and  an  attendant,  coming  to  the 
table  after  a  little  unusual  exertion,  laid  her  hand  on  the  table, 
and  the  child  next  to  her  observed  it  tremble,  and  cried  out  in 
natural  intonation,  "  Oh  my,  grandmother  !  " 

We  allow  our  children  to  talk  naturally,  abbreviating  occa- 
sionally as  cultured  people  do.  A  little  five-year-old  boy,  who 
performs  some  curious  and  original  acrobatic  feats,  has  been 
called  "  funny,"  and,  when  asked  what  he  is,  he  replies,  "  I'm 
a  funny  boy."  A  little  five-year-old  girl,  who  began  to  speak 
last  March,  when  asked,  "  What  are  you  ? "  replies,  "  I'm  a 
sweet  girl ;  "  and  to  the  question,  "  Who  gave  you  your  ring  ?  " 
"  My  brother  Wilhe,"  and  to  "  Do  you  love  Willie  ?  "  "  Yes." 
Another  when  told,  "  Show  me  your  golden  hair,"  responds  by 
turning  his  little  head  on  one  side  to  let  the  light  fall  on  it. 

Our  children  are  in  their  "  Training  Nursery "  five  hours 
each  day.  At  breakfast,  dinner,  and  supper  (occupying  about 
two  hours  more)  they  have  with  them  to  assist  them  to  speak 
and  teach  them  correct  table  manners,  etc.,  the  principal, 
teachers,  and  attendants.  Their  food  (not  drink,  as  tea  and 
coffee  are  not  given  them)  is  nearly  always  the  same  as  that  of 
grown  jDersons,  differing  usually  only  in  amount.  Oui-  bill  of 
fare  is  simple,  but  we  have  had  remarkable  immunity  from  ill- 
ness. We  have  meat  but  once  a  day,  as  a  usual  thing.  Des- 
serts are  usually  farinaceous,  varied  with  fruit.  Pie  does  not 
enter  into  the  bill  of  fare.  Children  are  guarded  against  kindly 
but  injudicious  feeding  by  guests.  All  packages  of  "good 
things  "  are  gratefully  received,  and  given  to  the  little  ones  at 
the  proper  time  and  in  safe  amounts. 

Periods  in  the  Training  Nursery  are  from  half  an  hour  to 
one  hour  and  a  quarter  in  length.  Pupils  go  from  Training- 
Nursery  teachers  to  other  teachers  for  their  physical  exercise, 
bathing,  etc.,  under  the  direction  of  the  principal.  All  are 
from  Pennsylvania,  except  two  from  the  South.  The  Penn- 
sylvania pupils  do  not  go  to  their  homes  until  the  habit  of 
speech  is  fixed,  but  their  parents  are  allowed  to  visit  them  at 
any  time.  Children  out  of  the  State  are  pay  pupils,  and  are 
allowed  to  go  home  at  Christmas.  The  mother  of  one  of  these 
cheers  our  hearts  by  writing  :  "  My  little  girl  makes  no  signs." 
She  also  says  :  "  I  am  much  pleased.  A  friend  came  in  whose 
name  is  Harvey ;  I  told  her  his  name,  and  we  were  surprised 
to  hear  her  repeat  it  so  distinctly ;  her  first  attempt  at  other 
new  words  surprised  and  pleased  me."  This  little  girl  has 
only  been  under  instruction  six  months,  and,  as  she  was  five 


12        Pennsylvania  Home  for  Training  in  Speech. 

years  old  on  entering,  we  had,  therefore,  to  discourage  the 
signs  that  had  been  made  to  her  for  years. 

Some  of  our  little  ones  who  were  taken  to  the  Zoological 
Gardens  will  say  in  response  to  the  question,  "  What  did  you 
see  at  the  Zoo  ?  "  "  I  saw  a  lion,  camel,  rhinoceros,  elephant, 
fox,  many  monkeys,  many  birds,"  etc.  Before  being  taken 
there  they  were  shown  good  pictures  of  animals,  among  these 
a  panther  and  giraife,  and  when  asked  if  they  had  seen  the 
last  two  at  the  Zoo,  they  responded  in  rather  an  injured  man- 
ner, "  No  panther,"  "  No  giraife,"  as  though  all  shown  in  their 
pictures  should  have  been  "  at  the  Zoo." 

We  are  in  the  country  district  of  Philadelphia,  and  near  us 
are  fields  and  other  rural  surroundings,  thus  giving  us  an 
opportunity  to  teach  them  about  country  objects  and  the  lan- 
guage of  them,  and  yet  we  are  only  fifteen  minutes  from  Broad 
street  Station,  Philadelphia,  to  our  railway  station,  Bala, 
Schuylkill  Div.  P.  E.E.  We  take  the  children  to  Bala  to  see 
real  locomotives  (which  word  they  speak  quite  well),  cars,  etc., 
and  in  on  the  train  with  us  to  Philadelphia.  On  the  way  we 
cross  the  Schuylkill  river,  and,  having  been  taught  the  name 
on  these  trips,  they  always  shout  "River !  "  when  we  reach  it. 

They  were  all  taken  to  Atlantic  City  last  summer  for  a  ten 
days'  stay,  and  learned  the  names  of  the  principal  things  there 
— ocean,  sand,  shells — and  learned,  by  tasting,  that  the  water 
of  the  ocean  is  salt.  We  told  them  that  we  called  the  "large 
water  "  ocean,  and  tried  to  keep  it  in  their  memory  on  our  re- 
turn by  showing  them  as  good  pictures  of  it  as  we  could  ob- 
tain. A  dear  little  cripple  at  the  seashore,  who  had  been 
intently  watching  us  with  our  little  ones,  heard  some  one  say, 
"  How  do  you  suppose  they  get  those  deaf  children  to  talk  ?  " 
He  replied,  "Why,  don't  you  seel  They  talk  to  them  aU  the 
time ;  that's  the  way  they  learn  to  talk."  This  sweet  child 
had  solved  the  simple  problem  which  seems  so  difficult  for 
many  of  his  elders  to  understand. 

Even  some  teachers  of  the  deaf  seem  prone  to  strew  the 
pathway  of  the  deaf  with  unnecessary  obstacles,  with  the  hope 
that  they  will  be  helps  to  the  acquisition  of  speech,  when  the 
secret  of  the  whole  work  is  imitation.  We  address  speech  to 
the  deaf  child's  eye,  in  language  suited  to  its  understanding, 
where  the  mother  of  the  hearing  child  addresses  her  child's 
ear. 

If  a  mother  talked  to  a  deaf  infant  from  birth,  it  would  feel 
the  necessary  vibration  for  speech  on  her  breast,  throat,  etc.;

but  as  mothers'  stop  talking  to  their  deaf  infants  as  soon  as 
they  learn  they  are  deaf,  they  unconsciously  do  the  worst 
thing — viz.,  stop  letting  them  see  speech  and  feel  it  on  chest, 
throat,  etc.  "We  have  to  make  up  for  this  by  letting  our  little 
pupils  feel  vibration  of  words  for  a  short  time  in  the  beginning 
of  our  work,  but  depend  principally  on  sight  rather  than 
feeling. 

A  communication,  expressing  our  views  of  the  simplicity  of 
our  work,  appeared  in  the  February  (1892)  number  of  the  Si- 
lent Educator.  It  was  an  extract  from  the  letter  of  an  Eng- 
lish lady  who  was  born  deaf,  and  who  had  been  taught  to 
speak,  and  who  has,  as  she  says,  "  never  met  a  deaf  person  in 
all  these  years."     She  says  she  could  understand  well  what 

A ■  (probably  her  teacher)  said  at  seven  years,  and  th^t  in 

their  walks  they  both  chatted  the  whole  time.     She  says  A 

sent  her  the  first  ten  numbers  of  the  Silent  Educator.  After 
some  good  words  for  that  journal,  and  reference  to  an  Ameri- 
can convention  of  teachers  of  the  deaf,  she  adds :  "  But  one 
thing  struck  me — that  perhaps  teachers  make  rather  too  much 
ado  about  this  or  that  method  of  teaching,  instead  of  treating 
the  children  as  much  like  hearing  children  as  possible.  I 
may  be  quite  wrong,  but  that  is  the  impression  the  articles 
and  questions  about  teaching  made  on  me.  As  far  as  I  re- 
member, I  have  always  been  treated  as  nearly  like  a  hearing 
person  as  possible,  with  the  result  that  now  I  very  soon  forget 
that  there  is  a  diiference." 

Apropos  of  this  deaf  English  lady's  congratulation  upon  her 
good  fortune  in  being  always  associated  with  hearing  people, 
we  may  refer  to  an  article,  entitled  "  An  Interesting  Pupil,"  in 
the  April  (1884)  number  of  the  A  merican  Annals  of  the  Deaf, 
in  which  Miss  Emma  Garrett  made  the  statement  that  her 
"  ideal  education  for  a  deaf  child  was  that  he  should  never  see 
another  deaf  chUd."  She  taught  this  "  Interesting  Pupil  " 
eight  months,  and  then  went  to  Scranton  to  establish  the 
Pennsylvania  Oral  School  for  the  Deaf.  Miss  Mary  S.  Garrett 
has  carried  on  his  education  for  the  past  eight  years,  and  his 
attainments  are  little  short  of  marvellous.  By  constantly 
surrounding  our  little  ones  with  speech  in  our  present  "  Home," 
we  approximate  very  closely  to  the  "  ideal  "  referred  to. 

We  have  no  wall  slates  or  black-boards  in  our  Training 
Nursery.  Mothers  teach  their  hearing  infants  to  understand 
spoken  language  before  they  understand  written  speech,  and 
we  follow  the  same  natural  plan.     When  we  began  work  here 


14         Pennsylvania  Home  for  Training  in  Speech. 

we  decided  to  receive  pupils  from  iwo  to  eight  years  of  age, 
and  give  them  a  six  years'  course.  Little  ones  entered  from 
two  and  a  half  to  six  years  of  age,  the  majority  being  nearer 
the  maximum  age.  We  of  course  prefer  the  minimum  age  of 
two  years — teaching  them,  as  nearly  as  possible  for  us,  to 
speak  at  the  time  at  which  hearing  children  learn  to  talk.  As 
some  who  entered  were  several  years  past  the  "  natural  age  " 
to  learn  to  talk,  we  of  course  consider  them  the  same  as  in- 
fants in  speech,  and  shall  give  them  the  benefit  of  our  "  six 
years'  course." 

As  some  were  past  our  minimum  age,  we  are  teaching  them 
to  write,  but  without  attaching  any  meaning  to  it  until  they 
know  how  to  talk,  as  the  hearing  infant  is  quite  proficient  in 
speech  before  learning  to  write.  We  have  devoted  but  one 
short  period  a  day,  from  4  to  4.30  P.  M.,  to  this  writing  lesson, 
but  the  tots  have  made  surprising  progress  in  writing,  and 
when  we  are  ready  to  attach  meaning  to  the  writing  the  diffi- 
culties of  penmanship  will  be  over  for  them.  If  most  of  our 
pupils  had  entered  at  our  minimum  age — two  years — the  mat- 
ter of  writing  would  not  have  received  any  consideration  until 
such  time  as  hearing  children  learn  to  write. 

Our  little  ones  are  taught  to  speak  by  the  word  method. 
In  Miss  Emma  Garrett's  first  work  in  teaching  deaf  children 
of  school  age  to  talk,  in  1878,  she  used  the  single-element 
method  for  one  year  in  deference  to  those  who  had  been  longer 
in  the  work;  but  it  seemed  to  her  unnatural,  and  she  gave  it 
up  after  a  year's  trial.  Hearing  later  of  great  results  being 
attained  in  Italy  by  the  syllabic  method,  she  prepared  a  driU 
for  that  method,  and  tried  it  a  short  time ;  but  for  about  nine 
years  she  has  in  her  own  teaching  used,  the  word  method, 
which,  properly  applied,  results  in  better  lip-reading  and 
speech.  At  a  jaubiic  exhibition,  four  months  after  we  opened 
the  "Home,"  one  of  the  pupils  pointed  out  forty-six  objects  in 
one  minute  from  his  teacher's  lips. 

Our  children  show  the  parts  of  the  body,  including  such 
words  as  cheek,  chin,  forehead,  eyebrow,  eyelashes,  shoulder, 
elbow,  back,  heart,  stomach,  ankle,  muscle,  fat,  bone,  etc. 
They  apply  this  knowledge,  understanding  a  reference  to  a 
toothache,  fat  boy,  thin  boy,  and  speak  of  bone  in  fish  and 
meat.  They  also  show  the  same  love  of  imagination  that  hear- 
ing children  do.  A  little  girl,  who  entered  speechless  April 
25,  1892,  remarked,  while  looking  at  a  picture  of  a  gii-1  feeding 
chickens,  "  The  chickens  can't  say  Thank  you."     She  also  said, 


Pennsylvania  Some  for  Training  in  Speech.         15 

when  her  teacher  pretended  to  hug  her  doll,  "  Oh,  be  careful ! " 
A  little  boy,  while  playing  with  a  stuffed  printed-cloth  cat, 
said,  "  The  cat  is  not  very  well."  A  little  girl,  playing  with 
her  doll  the  other  day,  said,  "  My  doll  has  the  backache." 
Another  child  saw  that  on  laying  her  doll  down  the  eyes  closed, 
and  she  fairly  shouted,  "My  doll  is  asleep."  They  tell  us 
their  dolls  have  blue  or  brown  eyes,  fat  cheeks,  the  color  of 
their  dresses,  etc. 

One  morning,  when  a  little  boy  had  forgotten  to  knock  at  a 
teacher's  door  on  his  way  down  stairs  to  bid  her  "  Good 
morning,"  as  was  his  custom,  he  said  to  her  at  the  breakfast- 
table,  "  I  forgot  to  knock  at  the  door."  Our  three-year-old 
girl  did  something  rather  cute  a  day  or  two  ago,  and  the  same 
boy  said,  "  Laura  is  a  funny  baby." 

The  children  understand  laughing,  smiling,  crying,  pouting, 
and  many  verbs.  I  have  heard  a  child  say,  "  Oh,  look  !  blue 
flowers  on  the  table  !  "  "  Look  at  the  sun  on  the  floor."  They 
understand  a  direction  like  "Put  the  ball  on  the  floor  near  the 

wardrobe  ;"  "  Give   the    apple    to ;"   "  Show  me  the  man 

feeding  the  chickens,"  etc.  (in  a  picture) ;  "  Show  me  the  girls 
carrying  the  books;"  "Show  me  a  boy  with  an  umbrella;" 
"Drink  your  milk;"  "Wash  your  hands,"  etc. 

For  many  years  we  have  labored  to  induce  parents  to  do  in 
their  own  homes  just  what  we  are  doing  for  the  young  deaf 
children  under  our  care,  but  experience  shows  us  that  the 
cases  are  rare  where  they  accomplish  anything. 

Wide  circulation  was  given  to  a  paper  written  by  Miss  Mary 
S.  Garrett,  in  1886,  entitled  "  Directions  to  Parents  of  Deaf 
Children  for  their  T  reatment  from  Infancy,  in  order  that  they 
may  learn  Speech  and  Lip-Eeading."  This  paper  was  clearly 
presented,  and  ought  to  have  aided  j^arents  if  anything  could. 
It  was  read  before  the  Medical  Society  of  Pennsylvania,  re- 
printed in  the  Medical  and  Surgical  Reporter,  Philadelphia, 
by  request,  and,  later,  by  the  Volta  Bureau,  Washington, 
D.  C. 

Finally  it  was  decided  to  establish  a  Home  where  we  could 
do  it  all  for  them.  That  the  success  of  the  work  may  be  shown 
where  it  will  be  as  helpful  as  possible  we  have  been 
awarded  space  in  the  fascinating  Children's  Building  at 
Chicago,  where  we  shall  transport  the  work  of  our  Training 
Nursery  next  summer. 

On  the  recommendation  of  Gov.  Pattison,  Lieut.-Gov. 
Watres,  and  Executive  Com.  Farquhar,  the  State  Commission.

The  building  is  arranged  with  regard  to  the  points  of  the 
compass,  so  that  all  the  rooms,  including  living-rooms,  train- 
ing and  night  nurseries,  teacher's  apartments,  kitchen,  servant's 
rooms  and  porches,  will  receive  the  proper  amount  of  ventila-

rooms occupying  the  best  positions,  at  the  southeast  end.

The  halls  are  wide  and  hght,  the  stairs  easy  for  children  to 
climb,  and  the  most  careful  arrangement  has  been  made  for 
escape  from  any  part  of  the  building  in  case  of  fire. 

The  sleeping  nurseries  for  two-thirds  of  the  children  are  on 
the  first  floor,  with  direct  communication  with  the  fire-escape. 

The  kitchen  is  in  a  separate  wing,  well  lighted  and  venti- 
lated, and  a  laundry  of  the  same  size  is  provided  beneath.

and  additional  teachers'  and  servants'  rooms. 

The  building  wUl  be  heated  by  steam,  indirect  method,  the 
radiators  being  all  placed  in  the  basement. 

A  safety  sectional  boiler  will  be  used,  placed  at  the  north,

A  thorough  system  of  ventilation  has  been  adopted,  outlet* 
being  placed  at  the  floor  levels  of  the  rooms,  connecting  with 
a  large  stack,  which  is  heated  by  radiators,  insuring  a  strong 
upward  suction,  and  will  be  in  continual  operation.

LESSONS  DRAWN  FROM  THE  PAST  HISTORY  OF  THE  EDUCA- 
TION OF  THE  DEAF  TO  GUIDE  US  IN  OUR  PRESENT 
WORK.     BY  MARY  S.  GARRETT. 

History  shows  that,  in  every  age,  any  deficiency  in  mental  development 
or  in  the  ability  to  communicate  with  others,  or  in  being  self-supporting, 
which  the  deaf  have  shown,  may  be  charged  to  the  ignorance  of  their 
social  environment  and  not  to  any  inability  of  the  deaf  to  learn,  be,  or  do- 
anything  and  everything  for  which  they  are  given  the  opportunity. 
Aristotle  declared  deaf-mutes  to  be  incapable  of  instruction,  and  the- 
poet  Lucretius  endorsed  his  opinions  as  late  as  50  B.  C.  Under  the  laws- 
of  Lycurgus  they  were  exposed  to  die,  and  the  ancient  Roman  s  threw 
deaf  infants  into  the  Tiber.  The  authorities  of  those  days  ranked  them 
with  imbeciles.  Modern  experience  proves  that  it  was  the  ignorance  of 
the  authorities,  and  not  any  mental  deficiency  in  their  victims,  which 
made  them  "  dumb."  Fortunately  for  the  victims,  the  authorities  only 
had  power  over  the  bodies  of  the  sufferers,  and  the  climax  of  their 
cruelty  only  opened  the  doors  of  the  higher  life  to  them. 

Occasionally  parents  would  hide  away  their  deaf  offspring  and  give 
them  some  instruction,  to  which  they,  of  course,  responded,  and 
gradually  it  dawned  upon  some  minds  that  they  might  not  be  idiots. 
From  that  time  until  the  second  half  of  the  eighteenth  century  we  read 
of  isolated  cases  of  deaf  persons  in  different  countries  who  were  vari- 
ously educated,  according  to  the  skill  and  knowledge  of  their  teachers, 
and  also  of  some  schools  in  the  monasteries. 

It  is  said,  however,  that  as  late  as  the  present  century  the  pagans  of 
India  and  other  Asiatic  countries  were  still  in  the  habit  of  killing  their 
deaf  infants. 

The  schools  and  work  established  through  the  Abbe  de  I'Epe'e,. 
Heinieke,  Amman  before  him,  and  by  Braidwood,  all  give  evidence  that 
the  deaf  were  only  waiting  their  chance  to  absorb  and  take  in  everything: 
that  is  allowed  them. 

We  owe  them  the  best  we  have.  Ever  since  the  Abbe  Tarra,  President 
of  the  International  Convention  of  Teachers  of  the  Deaf,  held  at  Milan 
in  1880,  who  had  had  an  experience  of  thirty  years  in  teaching  the  deaf — 
the  first  ten  by  the  sign  method,  the  second  ten  by  the  combined,  and- 


Pennsylvania  Home  for  Training  in  Speech.         19 

the  third  ten  by  the  oral  method — gave  as  his  verdict  that  "  Every  deaf 
child  capable  of  being  taught  by  signs  is  capable  of  being  taught  by  the 
oral  method,  without  exception,"  it  has  seemed  to  us  that  the  question 
of  methods  was  settled,  and  that  from  that  time  nothing  remained  to  be 
done  but  to  work  for  the  effectual  and  intelligent  application  of  the 
method.  If  there  are  any  flaws  in  its  application,  let  us  find  them  and 
correct  them. 

Why  should  we  make  deaf  children  wait  until  they  are  of  school  age  to 
learn  the  speech  and  language  that  the  hearing  learn  before  'i 

We  know  they  can  learn  at  the  natural  age  if  we  only  help  and  guide 
them  and  surround  them  with  speech,  and  only  speech.  The  deaf  child 
who  only  gets  the  oral  school  training,  even  though  it  be  the  best  possi- 
ble, is  forever  more  or  less  handicapped  by  what  it  lost  beforehand. 

While  the  present  need  is  for  efficiently  and  intelligently  conducted 
homes  and  schools  for  the  training  in  speech  and  education  of  the  deaf, 
may  we  not  hope  that,  within  a  few  generations,  society  may  do  its 
whole  duty  to  them  so  entirely  that  they  may  everywhere  be  an  active 
part  of  their  social  spheres  and  no  longer  need  special  provision  of  any 
kind?  Such  a  state  of  affairs  would  be  a  no  greater  stride  in  progress 
than  has  already  been  made  in  their  behalf,  and  it  is  exactly  in  the  line 
of  what  is  being  done.  All  that  is  needed  is  to  give  every  deaf  child  the 
same  amount  of  repetition  of  language  that  a  hearing  one  gets  when  it 
is  learning,  and  direct  its  attention  invariably  to  the  mouth,  to  the  ex- 
clusion of  every  other  mode  of  communication.  The  habit  of  looking 
at  the  mouth  is  very  soon  acquired  in  this  way. 

In  regard  to  the  learning  of  trades  by  the  deaf,  we  know  that  they 
must  ply  them  among  hearing  people ;  then  why  not  learn  them  from 
hearing  people  ?  We  know,  from  experience,  that  it  is  possible  for  them 
to  do  so,  and  would  plead  earnestly  that  they  be  allowed  the  opportunity 
of  accustoming  themselves  to  working  among  the  people  with  whom 
they  will  later  be  forced  to  do  business.  Let  us  in  every  way  try  to  lead 
them  forward  ;  they  will  do  their  share  of  the  work  if  we  only  give  them 
a  genuinely  fair  chance. 


THE  POSSIBILITIES  OF  THE  OEAL  METHOD  FOK  THE  DEAF. 
AND  THE  NEXT  STEPS  LEADING  TOWARDS  ITS  PEEFEC- 
TION.     BY  MAEY  S.  AND  EMMA  GAEEETT,  JUNE,  1890. 

In  order  to  know  how  to  give  the  deaf  the  benefit  of  the  natural 
method  of  teaching,  which  is  deservedly  so  much  in  favor  in  these  pro- 
gressive days,  we  must  carefully  study  and  investigate  nature's  methods 
and  laws. 

We  notice  that  hearing  and  deaf  children  begin  to  babble  sounds  like 
syllables  when  they  are  a  few  months  old ;  it  is  alike  natural  to  them  to 
talk ;  they  inherit  the  tendency  to  express  their  feelings  and  desires  with 
their  voices.  Here,  then,  our  work  begins.  The  caretakers  of  the  hear- 
ing baby,  the  world  over,  understand  this,  or,  at  least,  act  as  though  they 
do  and  they  meet  and  encourage  the  baby  efforts  by  addressing  its  ear 
with  simple  words  and  sentences,  incessantly  repeated,  in  connection  with 
the  objects  and  ideas.     Every  successful  effort  of  the  infant  is  haile  d 


20         Pennsylvania  Home  for  Training  in  Speech. 

with  delight,  and  it  is  continually  encouraged  to  repeat  each  new  attain- 
ment for  the  delectation  of  admiring  relatives  and  friends.  Not  only  is 
a  word  or  a  sentence,  as  soon  as  learned,  constantly  used  in  its  proper 
place  as  a  medium  of  communication,  but  no  other  means  than  speech 
are  ased  as  the  child  develops.    The  result  we  aU  know — the  child  talks. 

If,  on  the  contrary,  there  should  not  only  be  no  notice  taken  of  the 
hearing  child's  first  efforts,  but  it  should  be  kept  in  ignorance  of  speech 
by  hearing  none  (it  such  conditions  are  possible),  and  know  nothing  but 
motions  and  signs,  it  would  grow  up  dumb. 

It  is  natural  for  deaf  children  to  make  their  eyes  do  duty  for  their 
ears.  The  work  of  their  caretakers  is,  therefore,  plain  ;  let  them  first 
use  ingenuity  and  skill  in  directing  the  attention  of  the  children  to  the 
mouth,  and  never  distract  their  attention  from  it  by  motions  of  any  sort 
made  by  the  hand.  By  nature  they  are  imitative  ;  by  nature  they  in- 
cline to  talk  ;  by  pature  what  they  do  continually  becomes  a  habit.  The 
caretakers'  duty  is  to  give  them  only  speech  to  imitate,  and  plenty  of  it, 
as  the  hearing  children  get  it ;  to  meet  their  natural  impulse  to  talk  with 
every  possible  aid,  and  to  see  that  they  use  it  constantly,  that  it  may  be- 
come the  habit  of  their  lives  as  it  is  of  the  hearing  children. 

We  learn  from  nature  that  our  different  organs  are  developed  by  use 
and  exercise,  and  that  disuse  impairs  them.  Therefore,  a  deaf  child's 
voice  and  speech  organs  are  more  likely  to  be  injured  by  not  beginning 
to  use  them  at  the  natural  period  than  by  commencing  to  talk  at  the  age 
normal  children  commence. 

Deaf  children  who  are  guided  and  trained  to  speech  from  infancy  are 
more  likely  to  have  natural  voices  than  those  whose  voices  are  unnatu- 
rally neglected  until  they  are  older. 

It  is  among  the  possibilities  of  the  oral  method  that  these  simple 
facts  may  become  so  well  and  generally  understood  that  ali,  deaf 
children  will  be  thus  treated  in  their  own  homes.  The  present  need, 
however,  is  for  the  establishment  of  Homes  where  deaf  children  can  be 
trained  in  speech  from  the  time  they  are  discovered  to  be  deaf  until  they 
are  of  school  age.     We  are  about  to  establish  one  in  Pennsylvania.* 

Europe  has  set  us  the  example  of  superseding  sign  schools  by  oral 
schools,  and  we  can  help  her  by  showing  her  that  the  training  must 
begin  in  babyhood  and  before  the  children  are  of  school  age. 

In  the  Home  it  will  be  the  duty  of  every  one  connected  with  the 
establishment  not  only  to  refrain  from  signs,  but  to  be  in  the  habit  of 
talking  with  the  children  and  of  using  every  effort  to  have  them  talk  a.s 
constantly  as  though  they  could  hear. 

No  manipulators  or  pencils  will  be  used  in  the  training  ;  they  are  un- 
necessarily trying  to  the  children ;  if  they  are  trained  to  the  habit  of 
observing  the  mouth  carefully  they  will  see  the  accurate  positions  re- 
quired, and  can  learn,  by  frequent  practice,  to  get  them.  The  tones  are 
sometimes  made  disagreeable  when  manipulators  are  used,  as — because 
they  are  unpleasant  to  the  children — they  are  apt  to  affect  the  natural- 
ness of  the  tone.  Caretakers  cannot  be  too  careful  to  avoid  mouthing, 
using  their  arms  in  talking  to  the  children,  and  everything  that  is  un- 
natural, as  the  children   are   so    imitative  ;  if  we   always  give  them  tlie

right  thing  to  imitate  they  will  be  all  the  while  gaining.  It  is  a  solemn 
truth  for  us  all  to  remember  that  we  cannot  be  in  the  presence  of  little 
children  without  being  their  teachers.  Everything  we  do  and  every- 
thing we  say  have  an  influence  on  them.  It  is  a  law  of  nature  and  we 
cannot  escape  it. 

When  we  think  of  how  much  the  deaf  accomplish  in  our  oral  schools 
under  the  existing  disadvantages  of  entering  without  the  vocabulary  that 
normal  children  of  that  age  have  ;  that  the  years  they  spend  in  school 
are  usually  fewer  than  normal  people  spend  ;  that  not  only  the  general 
public  but  frequently  their  families  and  friends  do  not  yet  understand 
the  necessity  of  keeping  up  and  improving  their  speech  and  stock  of 
language  by  talking  with  them,  we  can  form  an  idea  of  the  possibilities 
of  the  method  when  it  is  perfected  by  beginning  at  the  natural  age, 
giving  them  as  much  time  at  school  as  they  require,  and  the  same  oppor- 
tunities of  the  general  communication  with  others  that  we  all  have. 

If  we  take  the  iirst  of  these  steps,  viz.,  train  them  from  babyhood  in 
speech,  it  will  "  count  "  on  the  other  two  as  if  they  enter  school  with 
some  speech  and  language  ;  they  will  gain  more  in  the  school  years,  and 
be  better  able  to  communicate  with  their  families  and  the  public  gener- 
ally when  they  go  out  into  the  world. 

Enough  cases  so  treated  have  become  like  normal  people  in  speech  and 
language  to  make  us  trust  that  others  so  treated  will  become  so.  The 
applications  that  have  already  come  to  us  for  the  admission  of  little  ones 
into  the  Home  show  that,  hard  as  it  is  for  the  mothers  to  part  with  them, 
the  benefit  to  the  children  will  induce  them  to  do  it.  The  States  pro- 
vide for  the  free  education  of  children.  As  there  is  only  one  deaf  one 
to  every  fifteen  hundred  of  the  population,  the  slight  additional  expense 
of  giving  the  afflicted  ones  the  benefit  of  all  known  opportunities  for 
their  education  ought  not  to  be  considered.  The  fact  is,  it  is  really 
economy  to  give  them  the  advantages  which  will  make  them  like  normal 
people  in  their  ability  to  communicate  with  their  fellows,  and,  therefore, 
self-supporting  and  useful  citizens. 

While  it  is  entirely  possible  to  make  them  so,  by  giving  them  equal 
advantages  with  the  normal  people,  we  cannot  hope  for  complete  success 
if  we  deprive  them  of  any  part  of  these  advantages.

1892-1893.

Privcifal  of  the  School. 


THE  CLEVELAND  DAY-SCHOOL  FOE  THE  DEAF. 

This  School  is  now  in  the  first  year  of  its  existence.  It  was 
opened  by  Mr.  John  H.  Geary,  a  semi-mute  graduate  of  the 
New  York  Institution,  and  lately  a  teacher  in  the  Arkansas 
Institute.  He  is  assisted  in  the  work  of  instruction  by  Mrs. 
Geary,  who  has  charge  of  the  articulation  department. 


JOHN  H.  GEABY. 


The  large  number  of  deaf  school  children  living  in  and  near 
Cleveland  has,  at  various  times,  led  people  interested  in  their 
education  to  attempt  to  establish  a  school  for  them.  The 
usual  course  adopted  was  to  collect  the  names  and  addresses 
of  a  goodly  number  of  these  children  and  present  the  list  to 
the  Board  of  Education,  at  the  same  time  asking  that  a  school 
be  established  for  them  in  connection  with  the  public  schools 
of  the  city.  On  the  refusal  of  the  Board  to  grant  the  petition 
the  matter  has  usually  been  dropped  for  the  time.  During 
the  past  twenty  years  nine  such  efforts  have  failed.  That 
failure  should  so  often  result  is  as  much  due,  perhaps,  to  a

lack  of  perseverance  on  the  part  of  the  promoters  of  the  proj- 
ect as  anything  else,  though  other  causes  have  not  been  vrant- 
ing. 

The  present  number  of  deaf  school  children  known  to  be 
resident  in  Cleveland  is  73.  Of  these,  about  30  attend  school 
at  the  State  Institution  in  Columbus,  a  dozen  more  attend 
various  schools  outside  of  the  State,  and  the  remaining  30  are 
expected  to  attend  this  School. 

The  School  was  opened  November  14,  1892,  with  an  attend- 
ance of  12  pupils.  This  number  steadily  increased  until  Feb- 
ruary, 1893,  when  there  was  an  enrollment  of  18.  It  is  located 
in  the  Arcade  Building,  in  the  centre  of  the  city.  It  is  but  one 
block  from  the  Public  Square,  where  all  the  street-car  lines  of 
the  city  converge.  Thus  it  is  easy  of  access  from  all  parts  of 
the  city. 

The  combined  system  of  instruction  is  employed,  as  the  ob- 
ject aimed  at  is  intellectual  improvement.  Signs  are  used  to 
a  limited  extent,  chiefly  as  a  means  of  explanation  for  some  of 
the  beginners  and  to  test  their  comprehension  ;  but  by  far  the 
greater  amount  of  instruction  is  given  through  the  manual 
alphabet.  In  the  daily  recitations  and  conversation  all  lan- 
guage is  spelled  out  just  as  it  would  be  spoken  to  hearing 
children,  and  the  importance  of  the  continual  use  of  complete 
sentences,  instead  of  disconnected  words  and  broken  English, 
is  impressed  upon  all. 

Considerable  attention  is  given  to  articulation  and  lip-read- 
ing. All  of  the  children  are  drilled  daily  in  the  articulation  of 
elementary  sounds  and  simple  English  words  and  sentences, 
the  meaning  of  which  they  know.  All  who  show  any  aptitude 
for  speech  are  given  much  individual  attention. 

Believing  that  of  aU  children  the  deaf  most  need  early,  sim- 
ple, and  pleasing  methods  of  instruction,  it  is  hoped  that  ere 
long  a  kindergarten  department  may  be  established,  from 
which  all  new  pupils  under  ten  yeai's  of  age  wUl  be  required 
to  graduate  before  they  enter  the  primary  classes. 

The  Board  of  Education  has  been  asked  to  make  provision 
for  the  education  of  the  deaf  children  of  the  city,  and  has  ap- 
pointed a  committee,  consisting  of  Messrs.  S.  S.  Ford,  W.  D. 
Buss,  Thos.  Boutall,  and  Martin  House,  to  look  into  the  mat- 
ter, and  an  early  report  is  expected.  We  have  little  doubt 
that  Cleveland  will  eventually  make  such  provision  for  its  deaf 
children  as  is  needed.

Souvent  aussi,  elles  n'ont  du  leur  origine  qua  des 
circonstances  imprevues  et  ignorees  de  la  vie  des 
hommes.  Telle  est  I'oeuvre  sympathique  des  pau- 
vres  sourds-muets  qui,  sans  le  devouement  et  la 
grande  charite  de  I'excellent  abbe  de  I'Epee,  sem- 
blaient  devoir  demeurer  de  longues  annees  encore 
dans  les  tenebres  de  leur  ignorance,  c'est-a-dire,  sans 
instruction,  sans  aucune  connaissance  du  bon  Dieu, 
ignorant  egalement  leur  nature,  leur  destinee,  etpou- 
vant  a  peine  distinguer  le  bien  du  mal.  Grace  done 
a  I'abbe  de  I'Epee,  a  ses  imitateurs  et  aux  gouver- 
nements  qui,  les  premiers,  ont  tendu  une  main  secou- 
rable  aux  malheureux  sourds-muets,  il  est  permis  de 
concevoir  aujourd'hui,  pour  I'avenir  de  ces  pauvres 
creatures,  les  plus  consolantes  esperances.  Les  hom-

Fondation  et  developpements  de  I'lnstitut. 

La  fondation,  sans  aucune  ressource  pecuniaire, 
d'une  institution  de  S3urds-muets,  n'est  pas  I'ceuvre 
d'un  jour  :  le  temps,  le  devoument  et  I'esprit  de 
sacrifice  sont  necessaires  pour  cela.  C'est  dire,  par 
consequent,  que  notre  institution  eut,  des  son  debut, 
bien  des  difficultes  et  des  epreuves  a  surmonter. 
Aussi  n'est-ce  qu'apres  plusieurs  essais  repetes  dans 
diverses  parties  de  la  province,  qu'elle  put,  en  1850, 
^tre  etablie  d'une  maniere  stable,  a  I'endroit  ou  elle 
se  trouve  maintenant. 

Des  1830,  la  Legislature  clu  Bas-Canada  (Quebec) 
prit  des  mesures  pour  secourlr  cette  classe  malheu- 
reuse  de  la  societe.  M.  R.  McDonald,  avocat  de 
Quebec,  fut  envoye  a  Hartford,  aux  frais  de  la  pro- 
vince, pour  etudier  le  systeme  d'enseignement.  En 
183 1,  M.  McDonald  jeta  a  Quebec  les  bases  d'une 
institution  qui  ne  dura  que  jusqu'en  1834,  faute  de 
ressources  necessaires. 

En  1836,  M.  I'abbe  Prince,  directeur  du  college 
de  Saint-Hyacinthe,  et  plus  tard,  en  1852,  premier 
eveque  de  Saint-Hyacinthe,  eut  la  genereuse  pensee 
d'adjoindre  au  pensionnat  du  college,  une  ecole  pour 
les  sourds-muets.  II  appela  pour  la  diriger  M.  Caron, 
el^ve  sourd-muet  de  M.  McDonald,  et,  afin  de  pou- 
voir  admettre  un  certain  nonibre  d'enfants  pauvres, 
il  soUicita  de  la  Legislature,  des  secours  pecunlaires

qui  lui  furent  refuses  ;  les  trois  eleves  qui  se  presen- 
terent  ne  pouvant,  par  leur  modique  pension,  payer 
les  honoraires  de  I'instituteur,  cette  seconde  ecolefut 
encore  fermee,  apres  trois  annees  de  sacrifice. 

En  1847,  M.  I'abbe  Lagorce,  cure  de  Saint- Char- 
les, sur  le  Richelieu,  ayant  dans  sa  paroisse  deux 
sourds-muets  auxquels  il  voulait  faire  faire  la  pre- 
miere communion,  fit  venir  M.  Caron  qui  avait  dirige 
Fecole  de  Saint-Hyacinthe  et  regut  ces  enfants  dans 
son  presbytere.  Ceci  lui  donna  I'idee  de  fonder  une 
institution  pour  ces  pauvres  malheureux.  II  en  fit 
part  a  M.  I'abbe  Prince  qui  I'engagea  a  attendre  le 
retour  de  Monseigneur  de  Montreal,  alors  en  Europe. 

Vers  la  fin  de  1848,  Mgr  de  Montreal,  voyant 
evidemment  que  le  gouvernement  ne  voulait  point 
s'occuper,  ou  du  moins  se  charger  des  quinze  cents 
sourds-muets  en  Canada,  se  mit  lui-meme  a  la  tete 
de  I'oeuvre  et  entreprit  de  fonder  une  ecole  dont  il 
offrit  la  direction  a  M.  I'abbe  Lagorce. 

Ce  digne  pr^tre  n'hesita  point  a  quitter  sa  cure  de 
Saint-Charles  pour  se  consacrer  a  I'enseignement  de 
ces  pauvres  infirmes  denues  de  tout  moyen  d'ins- 
truction.  Apres  avoir  regu,  durant  quelques  semai- 
nes  seulement,  des  renseignements  bien  incomplets, 
et  avec  le  secours  du  jeune  Caron  dont  nous  avons 
deja  parle,  il  ouvrit  son  ecole  le  27  novembre  1848, 
dans  une  maison  particuliere  a-  I'extremite  nord  de 
la  ville,  au  Pied-du-Courant,  aujourd'hui  Hochelaga. 

Cette  premiere  fondation  ne  reunit  qu'un  tres  petit 
nombre  d'eleves  et  ne  put  se  soutenir  qua  force  de 
sacrifices,  n'ayant  pour  toute  ressource  que  le  pro- 
duit  de  quelques  bazars  et  la  charite  publique. 

En  1849,  M.  ledocteur  P.  Beau  bien,  pere  de  I'hono- 
rable  ministre  actuel  de  I'agriculture,  pour  la  province 


lO  Fondation  et  Dheloppements. 

de  Quebec,  que  nous  considerons|a  bon  droit  comme 
I'un  de  nos  bienfaiteurs  insignes  et  devoues,  ayant 
offert  un  terrain  au  Coteau  Saint-Louis  pour  y  fon- 
der un  etablissement  religieux,  Mgr  Bourget  eut  des 
lors  la  pensee  d'y  faire  construire  une  maison,  pour 
y  fixer  I'institution  des  sourds-muets. 

Vers  le  milieu  de  septembre  de  la  meme  annee, 
Mgr  de  Montreal  mettant  toute  sa  confiance  dans  la 
divine  Providence,  commen9a  la  batisse.  Bientot  de 
petites  souscriptions,  des  dons,  diverses  sommes 
empruntees  permirent  de  continuer  rapidement  les 
travaux.  Quatre  mois  plus  tard,  on  fut  etonne  d'a- 
percevoir  au  milieu  d'une  carriere,  sur  un  terrain 
inculte,  un  grand  edifice  en  pierre,  eleve  comme  par 
enchantement,  ayant  80  pieds  de  longueur,  sur  43  de 
largeur  et  a  3  etages. 

Au  mois  de  mai  1850,  M.  Lagorce  qui  se  trouvait 
tres  a  I'etroitdans  son  logement  du  Pied-du-Courant, 
transfera  son  ecole  a  cette  nouvelle  maison  dontl'in- 
terieur  n'etait  encore  qu'a  moitie  termine.  II  fut 
done  oblige  de  s'occuper  de  faire  achever  les  travaux 
commences  et  de  pourvoir  aux  besoins  de  cette  vaste 
maison  sans  ressources  suffisantes  et  nullement  orga- 
nisee. 

C'est  avec  ce  modeste  personnel  enseignant  que 
debuta  Finstitution  actuelle  des  sourds-muets  qui  est 
placee  sous  le  patronage  de  Sa  Grandeur  Mgr  I'Ar- 
cheveque  de  Montreal  et  protegee  par  le  Goaverne- 
ment  Provincial  ;  eile  fut  incorporee  en  1874. 

A  M.  I'abbe  Lagorce  revient  done  I'honneur  d'avoir 
fonde  I'institution  actuelle  des  sourds-muets  qu'il 
confia,  quelques  annees  plus  tard,  aux  "  Clercs  de 
Si' Viateu)'"  dontW  fut  lui-meme  un  des  membres 
pendant  quelque  temps.

Comme  deja  les  ressources  etaient  minimes,  il  fal- 
lait  aller  a  reconomie  et  ne  s'accorder  que  rindispen- 
sable  qui  trop  souvent  n'etait  meme  pas  le  neces- 
saire. 

.  Ceci  explique  le  manque  d'unite  dans  I'amenage- 
ment  de  la  maison  qui,  au  premier  abord,  ne  laisse 
pas  de  surprendre,  avec  ses  petites  pieces  basses 
d'etage,  ces  escaliers  de  ci  de  la,  etc.,  etc.  On  s'a- 
per9oit  facilement  qu'une  annexe  a  ete  ajoutee  a  me- 
sure  que  la  caisse  le  permettait,  et  tout  cela,  naturel- 
lement,  sans  plan  d'ensemble,  allant  au  plus  presse 
et  surtout  tachant  d'obtenir  le  plus  de  place  possi- 
ble dans  un  petit  espace  :  probleme  qui  se  resout 
toujours  au  detriment  de  I'ordonnance  et  de  I'aspect. 
C'est  ainsi  que  le  premier  batiment,  d'abord  a  trois 
etages,  en  a  cinq  aujourd'hui ;  que  la,  chapelle  inte- 
rieure  est  devenue  le  refectoire  des  professeurs  et 
que  les  ateliers  places  dans  la.  maison  ont  ete  trans- 
portes  de  I'autre  cote  de  la  rue  Saint-Louis  et  relies 
par  un  viaduc  au  corps  du  batiment  principal. 

Dans  tous  les  rapports  de  I'institution,  on  trouve 
toujours  de  la  part  des  Directeurs,  I'expression  des 
memes  plaintes  et  des  memes  regrets,  a  propos  de 
I'exeguite  du  local,  tant  le  besoin  d'un  nouvel  edifice 
se  fait  sentir. 

Aussi  la  partie  vraiment  bien  amenagee  est-elle 
celle  des  ateliers  :  on  avait  de  I'espace,  on  I'a  utilise  ; 
tout  est  large,  parfaitement  ecl'aire  et  dans  de  bonnes 
conditions.  Ce  batiment  est  une  construction  en 
briques,  de  75  pieds  de  longueur,  par  45  de  largeur, 
et  a  3  etages. 

Sans  vouloir  refaire  ici  I'histoire  des  debuts  plus 
que  modestes  de  I'institution,  nous  ne  pouvons  pas- 
ser sous  silence  la   part  revenant,  dans  les  resultats

obtenus,  aux  divers  directeurs  de  I'etablissement  qui 
ont  succede  au  digne  abbe  Lagorce. 

Le  premier  d'entre  euxfut  le  reverend  Frere  M.-J. 
Young,  religieux  sourd-muet  de  la  Congregation  de 
Saint- Viateur,  que  Mgr  Bourget,  en  1S55,  avait 
appele  de  France  au  Canada. 

II  prit  la  direction  de  I'ecole  en  1856  et  eut  pour 
collegues  dans  I'enseignement,  les  Freres  A.  Belanger 
et  D.  Mainville,  pour  econome,  le  Frere  Prosp.  Ter- 
riault.  Avec  un  devouement  admirable,  il  mit  sa 
vive  intelligence  au  service  des  malheureux  sourds- 
muets  auxquels  il  portait  et  porte  encore  un  grand 
interet  etdont  il  peut  mieux  que  tout  autre  apprecier 
I'infortune. 

On  comprend  aisement  quel  surcroit  de  travail  il 
dut  s'imposer  pour  etre  a  la  fois  directeur,  procureur 
et  professeur.  Mile-End  etait  alors  loin  du  cen- 
tre de  la  ville,  les  communications  extremement  diffi- 
ciles,  les  ressources  restreintes.  Aussi  etait- ce  a 
pied  que  ce  bon  Frere,  apres  ses  classes,  se  rendait 
a  la  ville  pour  veiller  aux  interets  de  ses  pensionnai- 
res  et  de  I'oeuvre  qui  lui  etait  confiee; 

II  lui  fallait  de  plus  donner,  tous  les  dimanches, 
trois  instructions  cbnsecutives,  I'une  aux  sourds-muets 
de  I'institution,  une  autre  chez  les  sourdes-muettes, 
rue  Saint-Denis,  et  la  troisieme  dans  la  chapelle  Saint- 
Joseph,  rue  de  la  Cathedrale.  Gn  comprend  facile- 
ment  les  grandes  fatigues  qu'il  eut  a  supporter  et  les 
sacrifices  qu'il  dut  s'imposer  pendant  toute  son  admi- 
nistration ;  cependint  ce  bon  Frere  a  conservejusqu'a 
ce  jour  toute  sa  premiere  energie.  La  mimique 
expressive  avec  laquelle  il  traduit  sespensees  indique 
qu'il  n'a  Hen  perdu  de  sa  haute  intelligence.

J.  M.  YOUNG,    C.  S.  V. 

Deuxieme  Directeiir  de  I'lnstitution. 

(1856  a  1863). 


Fondatw7i  et  D^veloppements.  18 

Durant  la  gestion  du  Frere  Young,  trois  Peres  de 
la  communaute  des  Clercs  de  Saint- Viateur  ont  eu  la 
direction  spirituelle  de  I'etablissement  :  le  Pere  Jac- 
ques Duhaut,  de  1856  a  1857  ;  le  Pere  Lahaye,  de 
1857  a  1861  ;  le  Pere  Thibaudie  de  1861  a  1862. 

En  1863,  le  Pere  Belanger  fut  appele  a  succeder 
au  bon  Frere  Young.  Pendant  les  vingt  ans  que  ce 
devoue  Pere  dirigea  I'institution,  il  la  fit  beneficier  de 
sa  grande  experience  dans  les  affaires  et  d'undevou- 
ment  qui  ne  s'est  jamais  rebute,  malgre  les  difficultes 
nombreuses  et  parfois  bien  penibles  qu'il  eut  a  sur- 
monter. 

A  deux  reprises,  il  dut  se  rendre  en  Europe  pour 
y  etudier  les  methodes  suivies  dans  les  etablissements 
consacres  a  I'enseignement  des  sourds-muets.  En 
i87o  d'abord,  et  de  ce  premier  voyage,  il  rapporta 
les  principes  qui  lui  permirent  de  commencer  I'ensei- 
gnement de  I'articul^tion  qui,  jusqu'a  cejour,  a  pro- 
duit  de  si  beaux  resultats ;  ensuite,  en  1880,  pour 
assister  au  congres  de  Milan  et  s'edifier  sur  les  avan- 
tages  de  I'instruction  des  sourds-muets,  par  la  me- 
thode  orale  pure. 

Ce  fut  sous  I'administration  du  Pere  Belanger,  en 
1863,  que  furent  commences  les  premiers  ateliers,  au 
nombre  de  trois  :  la  reliure,  Xiniprimerie  et  la  cor- 
donnerie  qui,  en  1871,  furent  transportes  dans  un 
batiment  en  briques,  construit  a  cette  fin,  et  servant 
aujourd'hui  de  refectoire  pour  les  professeurs.  Les 
chefs  de  ces  ateliers  etaierit  :  le  Frere  Young  pour 
la  reliure,  le  Frere  D.  Mainville  pour  I'imprimerie  et 
le  Frere  Needham,  sourd-muet,  pour  la  cordonnerie. 

L'annee  1873  fut  particulierement  remarquable 
pour  notre  institution,  par  la  visite  de  Son  Excellen- 
ce la  Comtesse  Dufferin,  accompagnee  de  ses  deux

enfants,  le  jeune  Lord  Arthur  de  Clarendon  et  Lady 
Blackwood. 

Lady  Pufferin  ayant  apprls  qu'il  existait  a  Mon- 
treal une  institution  ou  I'articulation  etait  enseignee 
aux  sourds-muets,  avec  succes,  voulut  se  rendre 
compte,  par  elle-meme,  des  effets  produits  par  un 
precede  encore  unique  au  Canada. 

Son  Excellence  fut  regue  par  M.  le  Chanoine 
Fabre,  le  Revd  Pere  Belanger,  directeur  de  I'institu- 
tion  et  plusieurs  autres  membres  du  clerge  qui  I'ac- 
compagnerent  a  la  salle  ou  les  eleves  lui  presen- 
terent  I'adresse  suivante : 

A  Son  Excellence  madame  la  Comtesse  Dufferin. 

Madame, 

Nous,  les  eleves  de  I'lnstitution  des  sourd-muets,  vous  prions 
d'accepter  nos  sinceres  remerciments  pour  I'attention  toute  bien- 
veillante  que  vous  portez  a  notre  classe  infortunee. 

Votre  illustre  personne,  digne  de  Son  Excellence  Lord  Duf- 
ferin, a  conquis  le  respect  et  I'affection  de  ceux  avec  qui  elle  a 
ete  en  rapports,  par  les  nombreux  actes  de  courtoisie  et  d'affa- 
bilite  qui  marquent  tous  ses  pas. 

Les  rares  verlus  comme  les  excellentes  qualit^s  que  possede 
Son  Excellence  Lord  Dufferin  sont,  Madame,  bien  representees 
en  votre  illustre  personne. 

Nous  regrettons  que  nos  voix  soient  encore  si  peu  cultivees. 
Nous  nous  contenterons  done  de  partager  la  haute  opinion  qu'a, 
de  Vos  Excellences,  le  peuple  montr^alais,  et  de  nous  unir  aux 
concerts  de  felicitations  qui  s'elevent  de  toutes  parts,  et  dans 
lesquel's  vos  vertus,  vos  merites  et  vos  talents  sont  si  hautement 
et  si  justement  proclames. 

Lady  Dufferin  dont  la  haute  intelligence  et  I'esprit 
de  judicieuse  observation  se  sont  manifestes  dans  ses 
visites  k  nos  maisons  d  education,  repondit  dans  ces 
termes :

"  Je  suis  heureuse  d'avoir  pu  realiser  un  vceu  que 
"  j'avais  forme  depuis  que  je  suis  a  Montreal,  celui 
"  de  visiter  cette  institution  devenue  celebre  dans  la 
"  province,  par  la  perfection  de  cet  enseignement  d'ar- 
"  ticulation  qu'elle  a  inaugure  dans  ce  pays.  Je  dois 
"  avouer  que  les  preuves  qui  viennent  de  passer  sous 
"  mes  yeux  relevent  dans  mon  esprit  la  haute  opi- 
"  nion  que  je  m'en  etais  formee. 

"  M.  le  Directeur,  I'oeuvre  a  laquelle  vous  vous 
"  etes  devoue  avec  tant  de  zele  merite  tous  les  en- 
"  couragements.  Elle  est  digne  de  toutes  les  sym- 
"  pathies,  et  je  puis  vous  assurer  que  la  miennevous 
"  a  ete  acquise  du  moment  que  j'ai  ete  informee  des 
"  sacrifices  que  vous  avez  faits,  pour  le  soulagement 
"  de  ces  pauvres  sourds-muets." 

En  1878,  notre  institution  eut  I'honneur  d'obtenir 
una  medaille  pour  ses  travaux  a  I'exposition  univer- 
selle  de  Faris. 

Cette  meme  annee  I'edifice  de  I'institution  fut 
eleve  d'un  etage,  surmonte  d'un  toit  frangais. 

Enfin,  en  188  r,  le  Pere  Belanger,  cet  ami  infati- 
gable  des  sourds-muets,  construisait  les  ateliers  actuels 
et,  I'annee  suivante,  amenageait  la  ferme  de  Terre- 
bonne dont  nous  parlerons  un  peu  plus  loin. 

Toujours  sur  la  breche,  il  ne  cessa  dans  ses  ecrits, 
dans  ses  rapports,  dans  ses  discours,  d'appeler  I'atten- 
tion  publique  sur  le  sort  des  malheureux  sourds- 
muets  et  de  solliciter  des  membres  du  Gouvernement 
de  Quebec,  des  subventions  destinees  a  parfaire 
I'oeuvre  commencee. 

Lorsqu'en  1883,  il  quitta  I'institution  pour  aller  aux 
Etats-Unis  refaire  sa  sante  epuisee  a  I'oeuvre  des 
sourds-muets,  il  laissa  I'etablissement  en  bonne  voie 
de  prosperite,  et  I'enseignement  sur  un  pied  excellent.

II  s'occupait  du  progres  de  ses  eleves  avec  une 
sollicitude  toute  paternelle,  heureusement  seconde 
dans  ses  efforts  par  le  Frere  A.  Charest,  aujourd'hui 
procureur  de  la  maison,  le  Frere  A.  Groc,  sourd-muet 
arrive  de  France  en  1866,  encore  professeur  a  I'ins- 
titution,  et  le  Frere  E.  Terriault,  actuellement  prefet 
des  etudes,  lequel,  malgre  une  sante  delicate,  apporte 
un  zele  precieux  a  la  cause  des  sourds-muets.  Parmi 
les  autres  professeurs  competents  reunis  par  le  Pere 
Belanger,  nous  tenons  a  citer  en  particulier  les  Freres 
Lafond,  Gaudet  et  Mercure.  Le  premier,  attache  a 
I'institution  depuis  plus  de  douze  ans  et  longtemps 
prefet  des  etudes,  achevait  au  moment  de  sa  mort 
arrivee  au  mois  de  juillet  dernier,  un  programme 
deludes  destine  a  faciliter  le  developpement  intellec- 
tuel  des  sourds-muets  et  dont  nous  parlerons  dans  la 
niethode  d'enseignement. 

Durant  I'annee  scolaire  1883-84,  le  reverend  Frere 
Charest  cumula  la  charge  de  Directeur  et  celle  de  Pro- 
cureur ;  mais  comme  ces  deux  fonctions  exigeaient  un 
travail  excessif  pour  un  seul  homme,  il  ceda,  en 
1884,  la  direction  de  la  maison  au  Reverend  Pere 
Boucher  qui  n'a  occupe  cette  charge  que  pendant  un 
an  et  quelques  mois.  Durant  ce  court  espace  de 
temps,  on  a  pu  cependant  apprecier  le  zele  et  le 
devouement  avec  lesquels  il  s'occupait  de  ses  eleves 
et  des  interets  de,  I'institution. 

Le  16  octobre  1884  etait  un  jour  de  fete  et  de 
bonheur  pour  les  sourds-muets  de  Mile- End.  Sur 
invitation  du  Revd  Pere  Boucher,  Directeur,  Son 
Excellence  Dom  Henri  Smeulders,  delegue  apos- 
tolique  pour  le  Canada,  voulut  bien  venir  visiter 
notre  institution,  accompagne  de  son  secretaire,  le 
Revd  Pere  de  Brie  et  de  plusieurs  reverends   Peres

Oblats  de  I'Eglise  Saint- Pierre.  A  son  arrivee,  Son 
Excellence  fut  regue  par  le  Revd  Pere  Beaudry,  Su- 
perieur  des  Clercs  de  Saint-Viateur,  le  Pere  Bou- 
cher, directeur,  les  Peres  Ducharme,  Peeman  et 
Masse. 

A  cause  de  I'exeguite  de  notre  chapelle,  la  messe 
fut  celebree  a  I'eglise  paroissiale,  ensuite  Mgr 
dejeuna  a  I'institution,  puis  fit  la  visite  des  ateliers  et 
termina  par  les  eleves  qui  lui  presenterent  I'adresse 
suivante  : 

A   SON    EXCELLENCE    DOM   HENRI    SMEULDERS    COMMISSAIRE 
APOSTOLIQUE    EN   CANADA   (l) 

Excellence^ 

Les  Sourds-Muets  de  I'institution  Catholique  de  Montreal 
presentent  a  Votre  Excellence,  les  sentiments  de  leur  profonde 
reconnaissance  et  de  leur  filial  amour. 

Les  infortun^s,  sur  la  terre,  se  nourrissent  du  pain  de  la  cha- 
rite.  Ceite  nourriture  celeste,  ils  la  trouvent  toujours  en  abon- 
dance  dans  la  religion  chretienne  et  dans  le  coeur  des  apotres  de- 
voties  de  Jesus  Christ. 

Nous  connaissons  la  large  part  que  vous  faites,  dans  votre 
coeur  paternel,  a  la  classe  des  Sourds-Muets  ;  car  Votre  Excel- 
lence leur  a  prouve  son  amour  par  ses  paroles  et  par  ses  actes. 

C'est  done  avec  bonheur  qu'en  ce  jour  d'allegresse  nous  ve- 
nons,  nous  aussi,  adresser  nos  humbles  hommages  a  votre  per- 
sonne  veneree. 

Oui,  nous  accourons  avec  confiance  aupres  de  vous,  comme 
autrefois  les  malheureux  de  la  Judee  s'approchaient  du  divin 
Co'.solateur,  et,  impuissants  a  exprimer  convenablement  les  sen- 
timents qui  nous  animent,  nous  ne  pouvons  que  r^peter  avec 
ceux  que  vous  entourez  de  votre  soUicitude  :  Amour,  reconnais- 
sance au  grand  Pont'fe  Leon  XII  et  a  son  illustre  Reprdsen- 
tant. 

Depuis  1885,1a  direction  de  la  maison  est  confiee 
au  Revd  Pere  Manseau. 

En  1887,  une  annexe  en  briques,  de  115  pieds  de 
longueur,  85  pieds  de  largeur  et  a  4  etages,  fut  ajou- 
tee  a  la  partie  nord  de  I'institution,  faisant  face  a  la 
rue  Saint-Louis.

Comme  nous  le  disions  au  commencement,  les 
epreuves  n'ont  pas  manque  a  notre  Institut  depuis 
sa  fondation. 

En  1889,  un  violent  incendie  detruisit  les  precieux 
ateliers  construits  par  le  P.  Belanger,  en  1881.  Pour 
ne  pas  interrompre  I'enseignement  industriel,  con- 
sidere  comme  complement  necessaire  a  notre  ceu- 
vre,  il  nous  a  fallu  reconstruire  ces  ateliers  au  prix 
de  sacrifices  enormes,  n'ayant  re9U  pour  tout  secours 
qu'une  assurance  de  $2000.00  et  une  allocation  sup- 
plementaire  de  $3000.00,  du  gouvernement.  Aussi 
nos  pertes  seches  sont-elles  evaluees,  au  bas  prix,  a 
plus  de  $30,000,  ce  qui  retarde  d'autant  nos  projets 
de  construction  pour  la  maison  principale  dont  nous 
avons  signale  le  grand  besoin.

METHODE   D'ENSEIGNEMENT. 


La  methode  actuellement  suiviedans  notre  Institu- 
tion est  la  methode  mixte.     Expliquons-nous. 

Tous  les  eleves  arrivant  a  I'lnstitutionsont  imme- 
diatement  mis  a  I'etude  de  I'articulation,  de  la  dacty- 
lologie  et  de  I'ecriture.  Au  bout  d'un  an,  quelque- 
fois  meme  plus  tot,  nous  nous  rendons  compte  des 
aptitudes  de  I'eleve  et,  selon  son  degre  d  intelligence, 
son  age,  ses  forces  physiques  et  le  temps  dont  il 
pent  disposer,  nous  lui  apprenons  ou  le  langage  parle 
ou  le  langage  dactylologique,  et  I'ecriture. 

Les  eleves  qui  peuvent  apprendre  a  parler,  comme 
ceux  qui  n'ont  pas  les  aptitudes  requises  pour  suivre 
le  cours  d'articulation,  sont  instruits  par  la  methode 
intuitive,  dite  naturelle.  Avec  les  premiers,  nous  em- 
ployons  la  methode  orale  pure,  avec  les  seconds,  nous 
rempla^ons  I'articulation  par  la  dactylologie  et  I'ecritu- 
re, a  I'exclusion  de  tous  signes. 

Deux  raisons  nous  ont  fait  quitter  notre  ancien 
programme,  —  celui  de  la  methode  orale  pure,  — 
et  adopter  ce  nouveau  qui,  selon  la  rigueur  des  prin- 
cipes,  est  contraire  aux  regies  etablies  parle  congres 
de  Milan. 

La  premiere  resulte  du  petit  nombre  d'annees  que 
nos  enfants  sourds-muets  peuvent  consacrer  a  I'etude. 
A  Mile-End,  nos  eleves  ne  sejournent  pas,  en 
moyenne,  plus  de  cinq  ans.  Or,  on  comprend  facile- 
ment  que,  si  nous  ne  commencions  pas  leur  instruction 
dfes  la  premiere  annee,  nous  nous  exposerions,  pour 
un  certain  nombre  de  sujets,  a  ne  pouvoir  leur  donner 
dans  I'une  comme  dans  I'autre  methode,  qu'un  teitips 
relativement  restraint. 


20  Mitliode  d^enseignement. 

1^3.  secoitde  est  I'insuffisance  de  notre  local  qui  ne 
permet  pas  d'avoir,  pour  toutes  les  exigences  du 
service,  une  separation  absolue  entre  les  eleves  des 
deux  categories. 

La  vraie  raison  qui  resume  celles  ci-dessus  men- 
tionnees  est  le  manque  de  ressources.  II  faudrait 
done,  en  premier  lieu,  une  allocation  plus  elevee  du 
Gouvernement  Provincial,  ensuite,  des  dons  ou  des 
bourses  qui  permissent  a  I'administration  de  realiser 
les  vceux  souvent  exprimes  par  les  directeurs  passes 
et  presents,  de  I'lnstitution. 

La  methode  intuitive  dont  nous  nous  servons  pour 
I'enseignement,  prend  pour  modele  la  mere  ensei- 
gnant  son  enfant  doue  de  I'ouie,  a  comprendre  la  pa- 
role, a  executer  ses  demandes  ou  ses  ordres,  et  a 
exprimer  lui-meme  ce  qu'il  veut  dire.  Seulement  ici, 
c'est  lecriture  ou  la  lecture  sur  les  levres  qui  supplee 
a  I'ouie.  Ainsi  nous  ensei^nons  le  sourd-muet  a  com- 
prendre  d'abord  la  langue  ecrite,  puis  a  executer  les 
ordres  des  maitres  qui  sont  toujours  donnes  ou  par 
ecrit,  ou  par  le  moj'en  de  la  dactylologie,  ou  par  I'ar- 
ticulation,  enlin,  a  exprimer  lui-m.eme  ses  pensees  au 
moyen  de  I'ecriture. 

Comme  on  le  voit,  pour  instruire  le  sourd-muet, 
nous  faisons  subir  quelqueslegeres  modifications  aux 
mo^'ens  dont  se  sert  la  mere  pour  instruire  son  en- 
fant doue  de  I'ouie. 

C'est  done  sur  des  commandements  donnes  ou 
transmis,  des  actions  executees  par  les  eleves  ou  en 
leur  presence,  des  faits  successifs,  que  se  base  cette 
methode  intuitive,  dite  naturelle,  et  non  sur  I'ensei- 
gnement et  I'usage  des  signes  conventionnels  qui 
sont  presque  toujours  a  I'inverse    du   langage  ecrit, 


Methods  d^ enseignement.  21 

en  mettant  I'objet  au  lieu  du  sujet,  le  qualificatif  au 
lievi  de  la  chose  qualifiee,  etc.,  etc. 

Cette  methode  intuitive  qui  a  comme  moyens 
communicatifs  I'articulation,  I'ecriture,  la  dactylolo- 
gie  (epellaiion  sur  les  doigts),  et  quelques  signes  na- 
turels  toleres  durant  la  premiere  annee  d'etude  seu- 
lement,  est  reconnue  comme  une  dcs  plus  efficaces 
pour  I'enseignement  des  sourds-muets  :  elle  forme 
son  jugement,  !ui  donne  une  idee  juste  des  faits  et 
une  phraseologie  correcte. 

Tout  en  continuant  I'instruction  de  I'eleve  par  la 
methode  intuitive,  nous  consacrons  a  I'articulation 
quelques  moments  de  chaque  classe  qui  nous  met- 
tent  ainsi  en  etat  de  nous  rendre  compte  des  aptitu- 
des de  I'eleve  a  parler  et  de  la  possibilite  de  lui  faire 
suivre  la  methode  orale. 

A  la  fin  de  la  troisieme  annee  ou  au  commence- 
ment de  la  quatrieme,  ces  eleves  sont  en  etat  de 
continuer  tres  avantageusement  leur  instruction  par 
la  parole,  sans  etre  deranges  aucunement  dans  leur 
cours  deja  avance.  Alors,  au  lieu  d'employer  I'ecri- 
ture et  la  dactylologie,  nous  nous  servons  de  la  parole 
et  de  la  lecture  sur  les  levres,  moyens  plus  expeditifs 
et  plus  avantageux  que  les  deux  premiers. 

L'application  de  ce  nouveau  programme  a  donne 
d'excellents  resultats.  11  entretient  I'emulation  entre 
les  eleves  sans  les  fatiguer,  en  tenant  compte  du 
besoin  qu'ils  ont  de  se  delasser.  Les  difficultes  se  sui- 
vent  et  s'enchainent,  dans  un  ordre  rigoureux  et 
rationnel.  Le  professeur,  qiielque  etranger  qu'il  soit 
a  cet  enseignement,  en  saisit  la  methode  des  les  pre- 
mieres legons.  Les  remarquesquiaccompagnent  cha- 
cune  des  legons  lui  permettent  de  s'acquitter  de  sa 
tache  avec  fruit.  De  plus,  il  pent  toujours  consulted 


22  MSthode  d'  enseignement. 

aisement   la  partie  du  maitre,  oil  tous  les  obstacles 
sont  signales  un  a  un  et  resolus  methodiquement. 

Les  tableaux  synoptiquss  detaches  des  lefons, 
mais  qui  ne  font  qu'un  avec  elles,  presentent  aux  Ale- 
ves I'avantage  de  revoir,  en  quelques  minutes,  le  che- 
min  parcouru  et  de  rafraichir  leur  memoire  sans  la 
fatiguer. 

Au  moyen  de  ces  tableaux,  ils  apprennent  facile- 
ment  le  nom  des  parties  du  discours,  la  place  qui  leur 
est  assignee  dans  la  phrase,  et  aussi  a  corriger  eux-me- 
mes  les  fautes  qui  leur  sont  habituelles  dans  Fexpres- 
sion  de  leurs  pensees. 

En  terminant,  nous  aimons  alerepeter,  notre  nou- 
veau  programme  a  produit  des  resultats  etonnants, 
parmi  nos  eleves  que  nous  gardons  a  peine  cinq  ans, 
comme  nous  I'avons  dit  plus  haut :  il  repond  beau- 
coup  mieux  au  besoin  de  nos  enfants. 

Le  but  que  Ton  poursuit  avec  le  sourd-muet  est 
dele  rendre  capable  de  gerer  ses  affaires,  de  profiter 
de  ses  lectures  et  d'en  faire  un  homme  d'un  caractere 
ferme  et  serieux. 

Or,  etant  donnes,  d'une  part  les  nombreux  incon- 
venients  de  I'emploi  exclusif  de  I'articulation  dans 
I'enseignement  et,  d'autre  part,  reconnaissant  avec 
les  abbes  de  I'Epee  et  Sicard  que  le  sourd-muet  n'est 
completement  rendu  a  la  societe  que  lorsqu'on  lui  a 
appris  k  s'exprimer  de  vive  voix  et  a  lire  la  parole 
sur  le  mouvement  des  levres,  nous  nous  servons,  pour 
arriver  surement  a  son  intelligence,  parfois  si  rebelle 
a  saisir  ce  qu'on  lui  enseigne,  de  tous  les  procedes 
indiques :  intuition,  dessin,  ecriture,  dactylologie,  ar- 
ticulation. 

En  un  mot,  nous  nous  rangeons,  du  moins  pour 
notre  institution,  du  cote  de  la  methode  mixte.

ATELIERS. 

L'enseignement  industriel  donne  concurremment 
a  necessite  la  construction  d'ateliers  qui,  comme 
nous  I'avons  deja  dit,  sont  la  partie  la  mieux  amena- 
gee  de  notre  etablissement.  Ces  ateliers  sont  au 
nombre  de  sept. 

Couture. 

Dans  cet  atelier,  les  eleves  apprennent  a  coudre, 
a  faire  des  vetements  de  toutes  sortes  et,  ce  qui 
est  plus  difficile,  a  couper  ou  tailler  les  habits.  Un 
bon  tailleur  trouve  toujours  une  place  assuree,  car 
de  lui  depend  I'elegance  des  vetements. 

Les  eleves-apprentis  sont  sous  la  direction  d'un 
Frere  ayant  des  connaissances  speciales  et  assiste  de 
deux  contre  maitres  entendants-parlants.  lis  ont  dans 
leur  atelier  cinq  machines  a  coudre  et  tout  le  materiel 
necessaire  pour  se  perfectionner  dans  leur  metier. 

Cet  atelier  et  celui  de  la  teliure  sont  les  deux  plus 
suivis. 

Cordonnerie. 

Pres  de  la  couture  est  I'atelier  de  la  cordonnerie 
aussi  sous  la  direction  d'un  Frere  et  d'un  contremaitre 
entendant-pariant.  Ce  metier  qui  convient  si  bien  aux 
eleves  de  la  campagne,  est  suivi  par  un  assez  grand 
nombre  d'entre  eux.  On  y  apprend  tout  ce  qu'un  bon 
cordonnier  doit  savoir  pour  gagner  honorablement 
9a  vie. 


24  Ateliers. 

Reliure. 

Dans  la  reliure,  les  enfants  apprennent  a  plier  les 
pages,  ci  les  coudre  ensemble,  a  mettre  les  volumes 
sous  le  couteau,  en  un  mot,  a  preparer  le  gros  ceu- 
vre  qui  sera  acheve  par  les  apprentis.  lis  sont  diri- 
ges  dans  ces  travaux  par  deux  Freres  qui  distribuent 
et  surveillent  I'ouvrage,  aides  d'un  contremaitre 
entendant-parlant. 

Les  apprentis  n'ont  que  deiix  heures  de  classe  par 
jour ;  les  eleves,  au  contraire,  ne  vont  aux  ateliers 
que  pendant  deux  heures  et  ce  travail  est  pour  eux  une 
veritable  distraction.  Par  cette  occupation  ma- 
nuelle,ils  se  delassent  des  fatigues  de  la  classe  ;  aussi, 
rien  n'est  plus  curieux  que  de  voirl'empressementavec 
lequel  toute  la  petite  troupe  arrive  prendre  sa  place, 
pour  executer  sa  tache.  L'ardeur  et  I'emulation  ex- 
traordinaires  qui  existent  entre  tous  ces  petits  ou- 
vriers,  demandent  une  surveillance  tres  active  pour 
que  le  travail  soit  fait  avec  soin. 

Imprimerie. 

A  cote  de  la  reliure  se  trouve  Ximprimerie  qui 
depuis  vingt-deux  (22)  ans  est  sous  I'habile  direction 
du  Fr^re  J.  Coutu.  Cet  atelier,  malgre  son  impor- 
tance, ne  renferme  qu'un  petit  nombre  d'apprentis  et 
en  voici  la  raison  :  dans  "quelques  etablissements  de 
sourds-muets,  a  New-  York  en  particulier,  on  enseigne 
de  preference  aux  dleves",  le  metier  de  typographe 
et  certaines  maisoris  recherchent  specialement  ces 
buvriers  qui  doivent  a  leur  infirmite  une  attention  et 
une  application  soutenues.  Dans  notre  institution,  au 
contraire,  a  cause  du  grand  nombre  d'eleves  qui  vien- 
nent  de  la  campagne,  nous  ne  cherchons  pas  a  diriger 
les  apprentis  du  cote  de  I'imprimerie  ;  car  ce  metier  les 
eloignerait  plus  tard  de  leur  famille  pour  lesjeterau

milieu  des  grartds  centres  ou  ils  seraient  grandetnent 
exposes  de  perdre  leur  ame.  L'imprimerie  n'est 
done  desservie  en  partie  que  par  des  entendants-par- 
lants.  C'est  la  que  s'imprimeni.  non  seulement  tous  les 
livres  destines  a  I'lnstitution  des  Sourds-Muets,  mais 
encore  ceux  necessaires  aux  diverses  mafsons  sous  le 
controle  des  "  Clercs  de  Si-Viateztr"  qui,  comme 
on  le  sait,  dirigent  d'importants  etablissements  au 
Canada. 

Menuiserie. 

La  menuiserie  est  encore  un  metier  qui  convient 
aux  sourds-muets.  II  y  a  dans  I'atelier  tres  vaste, 
construit  a  cet  effet,  plusieurs  apprentis  qui  regoivent 
les  instructions  necessaires  d'un  Frere  et  de  trois  con- 
tremaitres,  dont  I'un  sourd-muet.  On  y  fait  des  travaux 
pour  I'exterieur  et  on  y  travaiUe  le  bois  avec  une  rare 
habilete. 

Les  eleves  sont  prepares  aux  travaux  qui  reclament 
la  connaissance  du  dessin,  par  une  etude  approfondie 
de  cette  branche  d'enseignement.  Un  grand  nombre 
de  dessins  a  la  plume  et  au  crayon  denotent,  chez 
plusieurs  d'entre  eux,  une  grande  facilite  et  d'heureu- 
ses  dispositions  pour  cette  etude. 

Le  dessin  lineaire,  les  coupes  de  plans  et  d'eleva- 
tion  de  bitiments  rentrent  dans  le  programme  d'en- 
seignement de  notre  institution.  Cette  etude  est  excel- 
lente  pour  les  sourds-muets  et  Ton  ne  saurait  trop  les 
engager  dans  cette  voie  qui  leur  offre  des  distrac- 
tions utiles  et  parfois  meme  leur  ouvre  le  chemin  de 
la  fortune. 

Nous  ferons  remarquer,  en  passant,  que  dans  cet 
atelier,  nos  eleves  apprennent  aussi  a  tpurner  le  bois, 
et  que  plusieurs  d'entre  eux  excellent  dans  ce  metier. 
Nous  avons  actuellement  pour  tourneur  dans  I'ate- 


26  Ateliers. 

lier  de  la  menuiserie,  un  sourd-muet  qui  a  termine  son 
apprentissage  il  y  a  environ  un  an  et  que  nous  payons 
aujourd'hui  une  piastre  par  joar  depuis  ce  temps  :  ce 
jeune  homme,  nialgre  la  grande  faiblesse  de  sa  vue, 
est  tres  habile  dans  ce  metier. 

Quand  nous  aurons  mentionne  encore  I'atelier  de 
peinture  en  bitiment  et  la  forge,  nous  aurons  fait  le 
tour  des  ateliers  de  I'institution. 

Ces  deux  derniers  ateliers  repondent  tres  bien  aux 
besoins  de  la  plupart  de  nos  eleves ;  car  un  sourd- 
muet  sachant  bien  le  metier  de  peintre  ou  de  forge- 
ron,  peut  gagner  facilement  sa  vie  a  la  campagne, 
sans  avoir  nullement  besoin  d'aller  demeurer  dans 
les  grands  centres  ou  il  est  toujours  expose  a  se  cor- 
rompre,  par  la  frequentation  des  mauvais  amis  qu'il 
rencontre  si  souvent. 

Ces  ateliers  demandent  un  grand  nombre  de  reli- 
gieux  possedant  des  connaissances  speciales  dans 
chacun  de  ces  differents  metiers. 

Le  besoin  d'avoir  des  ateliers  pour  comple- 
ter I'education  des  sourds-muets,  est  une  lourde 
charge  pour  notre  maison  ;  mais  il  nous  permet  de 
rendre  de  si  grands  services  a  nos  eleves  que  nous 
le  considerons  comme  indipensable.

FERME-ECOLE   D'OUTREMONT. 


L'agriculture !  voila  vraiment  le travail quiconvient 
au  sourd-muet  instruit.  Seul  dans  son  champ,  sous 
le  regard  de  ce  Dieu  qu'il  a  appris  a  connaitre,  en 
face  du  spectacle  magnifique  de  la  nature  qui  n'est 
plus  pour  lui  un  livre  ferme,  mais  ou  il  reconnait 
maintenant  un  reflet  de  la  majeste  et  de  la  bonte  di- 
vines, entoure  d'harmonies  mysterieuses  qui  n'ont 
pas  besoin  du  secours  de  tous  les  sens  pour  parvenir 
a  I'ame,  il  grandit  a  ses  propres  yeux,  ce  pauvre  en- 
fant jadis  rebute  partout ;  son  cceur  se  dilate,  il  se 
sent  plus  pres  de  Dieu  et  re9oit,  lui  aussi,  sa  part  de 
bonheur.  Voila  la  vie  qui  convient  au  sourd  muet ; 
c'est  aux  travaux  agricoles  qu'il  faut  le  former. 

La  Providence  elle-meme  semble  avoir  •  indique 
cette  voie,  en  ayant  permis  au  Pere  Belanger,  grace 
a  la  munificence  de  madame  Masson,  de  realiser  en- 
fin  le  voeu  si  cher  a  son  coeur. 

Au  mois  defevrier  1882,  Madame  Joseph  Masson, 
seigneuresse  de  Terrebonne,  si  connue  par  ses  gran- 
des  oeuvres  de  charite,  donnait,  sans  aucune  condi- 
tion, a  I'in^titution  des  Sourds-Muets,  un  lopin  de 
terre  de  plus  de  cent  (100)  arpents,  situe  a  quelques 
minutes  seulement  de  la  ville  de  Terrebonne,  le  long 
du  chemin  de  fer  canadien  du  Pacifique,  sur  la  ligne 
de  Quebec. 

Le  8  mai  1882,  on  y  installa  une  ferme-ecole  avec 
quatre  sourds-muets,  sous  la  direction  immediate  du 
Pere  Masse.  La  maison  d'habitation,  construite  la 
m6me  annee,  est  un  rectangle  ayant    1 1 2    pieds    de 


^8  Ferme-Ecole  d'Outremont 

fagade,  a  deux  etages,  avec  de  vastes  greniers  :  le 
premier  etage  est  solidement  construit  en  belles  pier- 
res  extraites  de  la  propriete  meme,  et  le  second  en 
bois.  On  arrive  au  second  etage,  par  une  rampe  en 
pente  douce,  d'acces  tres  facile  aux  voitures  et  aux 
chariots. 

C'est  done  la  que  commenga  Tenseignement  agri- 
cole  des  sourds-muets,  sous  la  conduite  du  Frere 
Charest  et  la  direction  immediate  du  Pere  Masse. 
Ces  deux  religieux,  dans  leur  grand  devouement  pour 
leurs  chers  eleves,  se  firent  tour  a  tour  architectes, 
mecaniciens  et  professeurs  selon  les  besoins  du  mo- 
ment. 

Terrebonne  qui  merite  son  nom  au  point  de  vue 
de  la  fertilite  du  sol,  est  un  pays  ou  Ton  peut  faire, 
avec  profit,  lelevage  des  animaux  :  c'est  de  ce  cote 
que  Ton  dirigea  I'exploitation.  Une  partie  de  la  fer- 
me  fut  mise  en  paturage,  une  autre  partie  reservee 
pour  la  culture  des  cereales,  et  une  troisieme  partie 
pour  les  plantes  fourrageres,  les  pommes  de  terre, 
etc.,  etc. 

A  cette  epoque,  le  Revd  Pere  Belanger  sollicita 
du  Gouvernement  Provincial,  I'etablissement  d'une 
grande  ecole  experimentale  a  Terrebonne  ou  I'ins- 
titution  fixerait  sa  maison  principale  :  il  ne  fut  pas 
alors  ecoute.  Comme  d'un  autre  cote,  on  ne  pou- 
vait  utiliser  avec  profit  qu'un  tres  petit  nombred'ele- 
ves,  sur  une  propriete  de  cent  (lOo)  arpents  cultives 
en  cereales  et  en  fourrage,  on  dut  songer  a  etablir 
I'ecole  d'agriculture  des  sourds-muets,  azi  noinbre 
de  quinze,  dans  une  situation  plus  favorable. 

Non  loin  de  Mile-End,  dans  la  municipalite  d'Ou- 
trem.ont,   se  trouvaient  en  vente  trois'  magnifiques 


Residence  et  constructions  rurales,    Silo,  etc.,  etc.,  de  I'Ecole  des  Sourds-Muets,  a  Outremont,  Montreal. 


Ferinc-Ecole  (V  Outreiiwnt.  29 

proprietes,  admirablernent  bien  situees  et  formant 
deux  cents  (200)  arpents  d'un  seul  tenant,  consacres 
en  grand  partie  a  la  culture  maraichere  et  pouvant 
servir  pour  une  bonne  ecole  d'agriculture  :  I'institu- 
tut  en  fit  I'acquisition  et  y  transporta  son  ecole 
d'agriculture  de  Terrebonne,  en  1887. 

Sur  une  de  ces  proprietes,  se  trouvaient  un  cotta- 
ge et  des  batiments  de  service  situes  pres  du  che- 
min  Sainte-Catherine,  au  pied  meme  de  la  montagne. 
Ces  constructions  ont  ete  conservees  telles  qu'elles 
etaient  lors  de  I'achat,  et  dans  le  cottage,  sont  loges 
les  educateurs  et  les  eleves.  Naturellement,  I'espace 
fait  defaut  et  Tamenagement  d'une  maison  privee  se 
prete  mal  aux  exigences  d'une  ecole  ;  mais  les  res- 
sources  ne  permettaient  pas  davantage. 

Les  salons,  a  gauche  en  entrant,  ont  ete  transfor- 
formes  en.  chapelle  ;  la  salle  faisant  face  a  la  porte 
d'entree  sert  de  classes  et  de  recreation  ;  a  droite,  se 
trouve  le  refectoire.  Le  dortoir  occupe  le  second 
etage,  avec  les  chambres  du  Pere  Masse,  directeur  de 
la  ferme,  et  celles  des  Freres  charges  de  I'enseigne- 
ment  et  de  la  direction  des  travaux  agricoles. 

Vingt-deux  eleves  sourds-muets,  munis  des  meil- 
leurs  instruments  aratoires,  sont  actuellernent  a  la 
ferme-ecole  ou  ils  apprennent  la  bonne  culture  ma- 
raichere, tout  en  s'instruisant  et  se  preparant  a  leur 
premiere  communion  ;  car  il  faut  bien  remarquer  que 
!a  culture  des. champs  n'est  pas  la  seule  occupation 
des  sourds-muets  de  I'ecole  d'Outremont :  le  travail 
aux  champ  ou  dans  les  granges  ne  s'eleve  jamais  a 
plus  de  cinq  (5)  heures  par  jour,^  souvent  il  est  moin- 
dre ;  la  culture  intellectuelle  est  surtout  I'objet  de  notre 
sollicitude  pour  ces  pauvres  enfants  qui  resolvent  trois 
heures  de  classe  par  jour. 


80  Ferme-Ecole  cV  Outremont 

Les  batiments  de  service  sont,  comme  la  maison 
d'habitation,  beaucoup  trop  etroits.  lis  comprennent 
I'ecurie,  la  vacherie  et  la  porcherie,  occupes  actuelle- 
ment  par  six  chevaux,  dont  trois  percherons,  huit  va- 
ches  de  race  croisee  qui  fournissent  le  lait  a  I'etablis- 
sement  et  a  I'institution,  et  une  vingtaine  de  pores. 
Voila  le  cheptel  vivant  de  la  Ferme  -  Ecole  ;  il  est 
minime,  mais  il  faut  attendre  que  les  ressources  per- 
mettent  de  construire  les  batiments  de  service  neces- 
saires,  pour  loger  convenablement  les  animaux  de 
race  perfectionnee.  D'ailleurs,  I'exploitation  de  la 
ferme  ne  se  porte  pas  a  I'elevage.  Nous  nous  appli- 
quons  a  profiter  surtout  de  la  position  rapprochee  de 
Montreal,  pour  faire  a  Outremont  de  la  culture  marai- 
chere,  dont  les  produits  trouvent  en  cette  ville  un 
debouche  assure  et  qui  a  I'avantage  de  ne  pas  limi- 
ter  le  nombre  des  bras  utilement  employes. 

La  ferme  est  consacree  en  grande  partie  a  la  cul- 
ture de  la  pomme  de  terre  et  des  legumes,  notam- 
ment  de  la  rhubarbe.  Un  beau  verger  qui  donne 
d'excellents  fruits  d'une  vente  facile,  un  petit  vigno- 
ble,  de  grandes  quantites  de  vignes  sauvages  culti- 
vees  maintenant,  sont  des  accessoires  fort  utiles  de  la 
ferme  :  on  fait  un  vin  excellent  avec  la  rhubarbe 
et  le  raisin  sauvage. 

Les  cereales  {ble,  avoine,  orge)  y  sont  cultivees  sur 
un  espace  tres  limite,  seulement  a  titre  d'enseigne- 
ment,  de  maniere  a  donner  aux  eleves  les  notions  ne- 
cessaires. 

La  culture  maraichere,  on  le  salt,  exige  de  nom- 
breux  travaux  et  il  n'y  en  a  pas  qui  puisse  mieux 
apprendre  aux  eleves  les  diverses  manieres  de  trailer 
le  sol,  les  sarclages,  I'emploi  des  engrais  et  le  drai- 


GraYUres  representant  leg   Aleves  au  travail  et  quelques-qns  des  chevaux  de  ferine  a  I'Ecok  des  Sourds-Miiets,  a  Outremont,  Montreal,

nage,  toutes  choses  d'une  importance  extreme  pour 
assurer  le  succes  des  recoltes  et,  s'il  est  permis  de  le 
dire,  toutes  choses  extremement  negligees  dans  notre 
pays,  par  la  generalite  des  cultivateurs. 

La  fumure  des  terres,  le  nettoyage  du  sol,  I'egout- 
tement  des  cham.ps,  au  moyen  de  rigoles  bien  entre- 
tenues,  sont  les  conditions  indispensables  de  toute 
bonne  culture  maraichere  :  cependant  combien  peu 
de  cultivateurs  en  tiennent  compte!  Aussi  sous  ce 
rapport,  la  ferme-ecole  d'Outremont  est  appelee, 
croyons-nous,  a  rendre  de  vrais  services,  en  prepa- 
rant  d'excellents  aides,  imbus  de  bons  principes  ;  car, 
le  pauvre  sourd-muet  qui  a  la  chance  d'entrer  dans 
notre  ecole  d'agriculture  est  certain  d'en  sortir  sachant 
lire,  ecrire,  calculer,  pouvant  faire  un  excellent  jardi- 
nier,  un  bon  laboureur,  enfin  un  cultivateur  modele. 


ETAT   ACTUEL  DE   L'INSTITUTION. 


Depuis  la  fondation  de  notre  etablissement  envi- 
rons sept  cents  (700)  sourds-muets  y  ont  regu  Fins-, 
truction  necessaire  pour  faire  leur  premiere  commu- 
nion et  acquerir  des  notions  sufEsantes  d'un  travail 
manuel.  Un  grand  nombre  d'entre  eux  ont  pu,  gra- 
ce aux  connaissances  acquises,  se  creer  des  positions 
convenables,  quelques-uns  meme  venir  en  aide  a  leur 
famille. 

II  est  sorti  de  I'institution  de  Mile- End  d'excel- 
lents  ouvriers  :  menuisiers,  tailleurs  de  marbre,  sculp- 
teurs,  dessinateurs,  graveurs,  typographes  et  pres- 
siers,  tailleurs  et  couturiers,  relieurs,  cordonniers. 
Ainsi,  a  Montreal,  nous  trouvons  trois  tailleurs,  qua- 
tre  ou  cinq  cordonniers,  plusieurs  menuisiers  tenant 
des  boutiques  pour  leur  propre  compte.  L'impor- 
tante  maison  Morgan,  a  Montreal,  emploie  dans  ses 
ateliers  de  couture  des  sourds-muets  sortis  de  Mile- 
End.  Ces  exemples  demontrent  surabondamment 
le  bien  realise  par  notre  maison  malgre  les  faibles 
ressources  dont  nous  pouvions  disposer  ;  car,  il  ne  faut 
pas  oublier  que  notre  institution  est  tres  insuffi- 
samment  subventionnee  par  le  Gouvernement  qui, 
malgre  toute  la  bonne  volonte  possible,  ne  peut  nous 
accorder  qu'un  subside  annuel  de  $9500.00. 

La  premiere  subvention  accordee  a  notre  insti- 
tution le  fut  en  1853,  et  etait  de  $600.00. 

En  1871,  sous  I'administration  Ouimet,  cette  som- 
fut  eleve  a  $1500.00,  par  I'influence  de  I'honorable 
senateur  L.  H.  Bellerose,  alors  membre  pour  Laval. 


Etat  actuel.  33 

Plus  tard,  en  1875,  sous  le  gouvernement  de  Bou- 
cherville,  elle  fut  portde  a  $5000.00 

Enfin,  en  1884,  I'administration  Ross-Taillon,  par 
I'influence  et  la  protection  del'honorable  Louis  Beau- 
bien,  membre  pour  Hochelaga,  voulut  bien  elever 
cette  allocation  au  montant  que  nous  recevons  actu- 
ellement. 

On  comprend  facilement  qu'une  aussi  faible  alloca- 
tion nous  fournit  a  peine  les  moyens  de  subvenir  aux 
besoins  les  plus  pressants  ;  car,  au  lieu  de  cent  quinze 
(115)  eleves  que  nous  recevons  actuellement, 
nous  devrions  en  recevoir  aw  mains  trois  cents  (3oo)  — 
notre  local  et  nos  finances  le  permettant  ^ — ^  pour 
pouvoir  repondre  aux  exigences  de  la  Province. 

II  est  reconnu  par  tous  ceux  qui  s'occupent  de  Fins- 
truction  des  sourds-muets,  qu'un  eleve  ne  peut  couter 
moins  de  $150.00  a  $200.00,  par  annee ;  or,  sur 
cette  somme,  la  grande  majorite  des  parents  de  nos 
enfants  ne  peuvent  jamais  payer  plus  de  $50.00, 
souvent  moins.  Nous  ne  surprendrons  done  personne 
en  disant  que  dans  les  conditions  ou  nous  nous  tfou- 
vons,  notre  maison  ne  peut  se  soutenir  que  grace 
aux  efforts  energiques  que  nous  faisons,  et  a  la  sage 
et  habile  administration  de  notre  procureur  qui  pra- 
tique la  plus  stricte  economie  pour  nous  fournir  les 
Tessources  necessaires  a  I'entretien  de  nos  eleves, 
dont  le  nombre  varie  de  cent  quinze  (115)  a  cent 
trente  (130),  dans  nos  deux  ecoles  de  Mile-End  et 
d'Outremont.  Notre  personnel  enseignant  comprend 
trente  (30)  Peres  et  Freres. 

Le  materiel  scolaire  dont  nous  avons  besoin  est 
tres  couteux  et  les  machines  pour  nos  ateliers  sont  tres 
dispendieuses.  Pour  faire  face  a  toutes  ces  charges, 
nous  n'avons  d'autres  revenus  que  le  produit  de  notre 


34  Etat  aciuel. 

travail,  un  secours  minime  du  Gouvernement  Pro- 
vincial et  la  tres  faible  pension  exigee  de  nos  eleves. 

Cependant,  on  a  vu  quelles  ameliorations  reclame 
notre  maison.  Forcement,  il  nous  faudra  bien  attendre 
des  temps  meilleurs,  pour  commencer  la  construction 
d'un  etablissement  ou  nous  puissions  separer  les 
eleves  sourds-parlants  des  sourds-muets,  et  avoir  una 
meilleure  installation  pour  les  classes  et  le  logement 
des  professeurs  qui  ont  tout  sacrifie,  afin  de  laisser 
plus  de  place  a  leurs  pensionnaires. 

Mettons  toute  notre  confiance  dans  la  Divine 
Providence  et  esperons  que,  pour  le  bien  de  nos 
chers  sourds-muets,  la  realisation  de  nos  intentions, 
n'eprouvera  pas  de  trop  longs  retards.

REGLES    ET    REGLEMENTS    POUR    L  ADMISSION 
DES   ELEVES. 

Cette  institution  fondee  en  1848,  et  incorporee  en 
1874,  est  placee  sous  le  patronage  de  Sa  Grandeur, 
Monseigneur  I'Archeveque  de  Montreal,  et  protegee 
par  le  Gouvernement  Provincial. 

Situee  dans  la  partie  la  plus  saine  de  la  ville,  au 
pied  meme  du  Mont-Royal,  elle  embrasse  un  coup 
d'oeil  magnifique  etjouit  d'unair  puretsalubre,  qui  en 
font  un  etablissement  de  premiere  classe. 

Cette  institution  est  destinee  aux  enfants  entiere- 
mentou  partiellement  sourds,  dont  I'education  ne  peut 
se  faire  dans  les  ecoles  communes. 

Ce  n'est  pas  un  asile,  mais  une  vraie  maison  d'educa- 
tion,  et  on  ne  peut  y  admettre  ou  retenir  que  ceux 
qui,  a  une  intelligence  et  a  une  sante  au  moins  ordi- 
naires,  joignent  de  bonnes  habitudes  morales  et  sont 
iges  d'au  moins  neuf  (9)  ans  ;  ceux  d'une  sante  deli- 
cate doivent  avoir  au  moins  douze  (12)  ans. 


36  ProsjK'cfns 

Les  eleves  sont  constamment  sous  la  surveillance 
de  leurs  maitres,  et  la  discipline  est  mise  en  force 
d'une  maniere  ferme  mais  en  meme  temps  paternelle. 
On  ne  fait  usage  d'aucune  punition  corporelle  :  I'hon- 
neur  et  les  recompenses  sont  les  seuls  moyens  d'emu- 
lation. 

Un  eleve  dont  la  conduite  morale  et  I'indiscipline 
seraient  un  exemple  dangereux  pour  ses  condisciples, 
est  renvoye  immediatement  a  ses  parents. 

A  la  fin  de  chaque  semestre,  un  bulletin  donnant 
la  conduite  des  eleves,  leur  application  et  leur  progres 
dans  les  etudes,  est  envoye  aux  parents  ou  aux  gar- 
diens. 

Au  departement  scientifique,  nous  avons  joint  un 
departement  industriel  ou  les  eleves,  deux  heures  par 
jour,  regoivent  une  instruction  theorique  et  pratique. 
Les  differents  metiers  dont  se  compose  ce  departe- 
ment sont  :  Xi7ii primer ie,  la  stereotypie,  la  reliiire,  la 
couUwe,  la  cordonnerie,  la  iiieninserie,  la.  peinhire  et  la 
forge. 

Comme  plusieurs  de  nos  eleves  sont  fils  de  culti- 
vateurs,  et  qu'un  certain  nombre  d'entre  eux  desirent 
se  livrer  a  I'agriculture,  nous  leur  donnons,  sur  notre 
ferme  d'Outremont,  des  legons  pratiques  d'agricultu- 
re  et  d'arboriculture. 

Le  commencement  de  I'annee  scolaire  est  le  seul 
temps  determine  pour  I'admission  des  eleves  ;  nul  ne 
■  sera  admis  apres  la  rentree,  si  ce  n'est  pour  de  graves 
raisons. 

Comme  nous  ne  pouvons  recevoir  qu'un  nombre 
restreint  d'eleves,  il  est  desirable  que  les  demandes 
d'admission  soient  faites  en  mai  ou,au  plus  tard,  en  juin. 

L'annee  scolaire  commence  le  premier  mercredi  de 
septembre  et  se  termine  le  troisieme  mercredi  de  juin. 
Aucune  vacance  n'est  accordee  au  commencement  de 
la  nouvelle  annee. 

Les  paiements  se  font  en  deux  termes,  et  chaque 
terme  est  strictement  payable  d'avance  ;  moitie  a 
I'entree,  moitie  au  premier  fevrier,

Aucune  reduction  considerable  n'est  faite  sur  les 
prix  ordinaireSj  a  moins  d'un  certificat  de  monsieur  le 
cure  de  I'enfant,  constatant  I'impossibilite  ou  se  trou- 
ve  cette  famille  d&amp;  payer  le  plein  montant  demande. 

II  ne  sera  fait  aucune  deduction  pour  les  absences 
des  eleves,  si  ce  n  est  pour  cause  de  maladie  prolon- 
ged 

Les  livres,  les  soins  medicaux  etc.,  sont  a  la  charge 
des  parents.  Ceux-ci  sont  pries  de  deposer  entre 
les  mains  du  Procureur,  la  somme  d'au  moins  deux 
($2.00)  piastres,  pour  les  depenses  imprevues  de  leurs 
enfants. 

Les  eleves  doivent  etrepourvus  de  tous  les  habits 
mentionnes  dans  le  trousseau  et  avoir  une  bonne 
malle,  capable  de  contenir  tous  les  articles  qui  de- 
vront  porter  le  nom  de  I'eleve. 

Le  costume,  qui  est  obligatoire,  doit  etre  achete  et  fait

COUKS  D'ETUDES. 

Le  cours  complet  est  de  huit  ans.  11  comprend 
deux  cours  bien  separes  :  le  frangais  et  I'anglais. 
Chacun  de  ces  cours  se  subdivise  en  deux  branches ; 
I'une  a  pour  objet  la  mithode  or  ale,  par  laquelle" 
on  instruit  le  sourd-muet  a  I'aide  de  la  parole,  de  la 
lecture  sur  les  levres  et  de  I'ecriture  ;  I'autre  comprend 
la  methode  frangaise  qui  fait  usage  de  la  dactylologie 
et  de  I'ecriture, 


38  Prospectus. 

Les  eleves  qui  peuvent  apprendre  a  parler,  comme 
ceux  qui  n'ont  pas  les  aptitudes  requises  pour  suivre 
le  cours  de  I'articulation,  sont  instruits  par  la  methode 
intuitive,  dite  naturelle.  Avec  les  premiers,  on  se 
sert  de  la  parole  et  de  la  lecture  sur  les  levres ;  avec 
les  seconds,. on  remplace  I'arrticulation  par  la  dacty- 
lologie  et  I'ecriture,  a  I'exclusion  de  tout  signe. 

La  methode  orale  n'est  applicable,  avec  succes, 
que  lorsque  le  sujet  jouit  du  parfait  exercice  de  ses 
facultes  intellect  jelles,  qu'il  n'a  pas  plus  de  quinze 
ans  et  qu'il  doit  suivre  tout  le  cours. 

Apres  avoir  acquis  la  connaissance  d'une  langue, 
les  eleves  peuvent  apprendre  I'autre  ;  mais  jamais  les 
deux  a  la  fois. 

Le  cours  d'etudes  est  celui  d'une  bonne  academie 
commerciale.  II  comprend  :  la  Grammaire,  I'Histoire, 
la  Geographie,  le  Cathechisme,  quelques  notions  sur 
les  sciences  naturelles,  I'Arithmetique,  la  Tenue  des

IN    THE   PROVINCE   OF   QUEBEC 

UNDER  THE  DIRECTION  OF  THE 

►^H  CLERICS  OF  SAINT  -  VIATOR  i-^ 

MILE-ENB,   MONTREAL,  P.  Q. 

CANADA. 


RULES   AND    REGULATIONS   FOR   THE    ADMISSION 
OF  PUPILS. 

This  Institution  founded  in  1848,  and  incorporated 
in  1874,  is  placed  under  the  p9,tronage  of  His  Grace, 
the  Archbishop  of  Montreal,  and  protected  by  the 
Provincial  Government. 

It  is  situated  in  the  healthiest  part  of  the  city,  on 
the  northeastern  side  of  "  Mount  Royal."  The  beauti- 
ful scenery  of  the  surrounding  country  and  the  piire, 
bracing  air  of  the  mountain,  contribute  to  render  this 
Institution  a  first  class  establishment. 

Montreal,  the  business  center  of  the  whole  Do- 
minion, is  easily  accessible  on  all  sides  by  the  Grand- 
Trunk  and  Canadian  Pacific  Railways ;  in  summer 
time,' on  the  East  and  West,  by  the  Ontario  and  Ri- 
chelieu boats. 

This  Institution  is  intended  for  children  who  are 
entirely  or  partially  deaf,  and  cannot  be  educated  in 
gpmmon  schools, 


44  Prosjjedus. 

It  is  not  an  asylum,  but  a  school  for  imparting 
knowledge,  and  none  can  be  admitted  or  retained, 
except  those  who  have,  at  least,  ordinary  vigor  of 
mind  and  body,  good  moral  habits,  and  attained  their 
ninth  year — unhealthy  boys  must  be  twelve  years 
old. 

Pupils  are  constantly  under  the  supervision  of  their 
professors,  and  the  discipline  is  enforced  in  a  strict, 
though  kind  manner.  Corporal  chastisements  are  not 
resorted  to  :  honor  and  rewards  are  the  only  means 
of  emulation.  Pupils  found  guilty  of  immorality  or 
open  resistance  are  in  clanger  of  being  expelled. 

At  the  end  of  every  scholastic  quarter,  a  report 
stating  the  conduct  of  the  pupils,  their  application 
and  progress  in  studies,  is  sent  to  parents  or  guardians. 

To  the  scientific  department,  we  have  added  an 
industrial  one,  in  which  the  pupils  receive  every  day, 
two  hours  of  theoretical  and  practical  lessons.  Dif- 
ferent trades  can  be  learned  in  the  following  depart- 
ments i/rw^^fe/^^',  ji?^r^(?/y/'^^^'^/%'.  book-binding,  shoe- 
making,  tailoring,  joinery, painting  and  blacksmithing. 

Practical  lessons  in  agriculture  and  arboriculture  are 
given  to  pupils  who  are  farmers'  sons,  or  who  desire 
to  devote  themselves  to  agriculture  in  after  life. 

The  beginning  of  the  scholastic  year  is  the  only 
time  deemed  suitable  for  the  admission  of  pupils, 
and  none  will  be  received  or  readmitted  at  any  other 
time,  save  for  the  most  urgent  reasons. 

The  number  of  pupils  being  limited,  it  is  desirable 
that  all  applications  for  an  admission,  be  made  either 
in  May  or,  at  least,  in  June. 

The  scholastic  year  opens  on  the  first  Wednesday 
of  September  and  closes  on  the  third  Wednesday  of 
June.    There  are  no  Christmas  nor  Easter  holidays. 

Payments  to  be  made  half  yearly  :  in  September 
and  February,  strictly  in  advance. 

No  deduction  is  made  for  absence,  except  in  case 
of  protracted  illness. 


Prospectus.  45 

No  important  deduction  will  be  allowed  on  regular 
prices,  unless  a  certificate  of  the  pupil's  parish  priest 
show  the  impossibility  for  the  family  to  pay  the  full 
terms. 

Books,  stationary  and  medical  attendance  are  extra 
charges.  As  no  advance  is  made  by  the  Institu- 
tion, parentis  will  please  deposit  with  the  Treasurer, 
the  sum  of,  at  least,  two  ($2.00)  dollars,  for  incidental 
expenses. 

Pupils  will  come  well  supplied  with  all  the  clothes 
mentionned  in  the  "  Outfit,  "  and  have  a  good  subs- 
tantial trunk  :  every  article  should  be  marked  with 
the  name  of  the  owner. 

The  uniform,  is  requisite  3,nd  should  be  bought  and 
made  at  the  Institution. 

Every  pupil,  on  his  entrance,  has  to  produce  his 
baptismal  record.

COURSE  OF  STUDIES. 

The  full  period  of  education  and  instruction  is  eight 
years.  It  includes  two  distinct  courses  :  the  English 
and  French.  Each  of  these  courses  is  subdivided  into 
two  branches,  one  taught  by  means  of  the  oral  method, 
viz  :  speech  and  lip-reading,  and  the  other  after  the 
French  Method,  which  makes  use  of  dactylology  and 
writing. 


■±6  Prospectus. 

The  pupils  who  can  attain  speech,  as  well  as  those 
who  have  not  the  dispositions  required  to  follow  the 
course  of  articuktion,  are  instructed  after  the  Intui- 
tive or  natural  Method.  With  the  former,  articulation 
and  lip-reading-  are  used ;  Avith  the  latter,  articulation 
is  replaced  by  dactylology  and  writing  :  all  signs 
being  suppressed. 

The  oral  method  is  applicable  with  success  only  to 
those  who  possess  the  use  of  all  their  intellectual  fa- 
culties, and  who,  not  being  over  fifteen  years  of  age, 
are  to  follow  the  whole  course. 

Having  acquired  the  knowledge  of  one  language, 
a  pupil  may  study  the  other,  but  both  languages  can 
never  be  taught  simultaneously. 

The  course  of  studies  is  that  of  a  good  commercial 
academy  and  embraces  Catechism,  Grammar,  His- 
tory, Geography,  the  outlines  of  natural  sciences, 
Arithmetic,  Book-Keeping,  Drawing,  Articulation, 
Lip-Reading,  etc.,  etc.  \

INSTITUTE 


FOR  THE 


Female  Deaf  and  Dumb 


OF  THE 


Province  of  Quebec. 


^=^~&amp;C:fsS~ 


INTEODUCTION 


This  Institute  was  created  in  1851,  in  the  little  town  of 
Longue-Pointe,  by  the  Sisters  of  Charity  of  Providence,  and 
under  the  auspices  of  Mgr.  I.  Bourget,  Bishop  of  Montreal.  It 
was  subsequently  removed  to  the  city  of  Montreal  in  1858,  and 
finally  established  in  1864  on  its  actual  ground  between  S.  Denis, 
Berri,  Cherrier  and  Eoy  Streets,  which  ground  covers  an  extent 
of  nearly  8  acres. 

It  has  a  rather  exceptional  site  :  standing  on  that  height 
which  seems  to  rise  as  the  first  step  of  Mount  Eoyal,  it  enjoys 
an  admirable  view  on  the  City  and  on  the  valley  of  the  St. 
Lawrence,  while  it  is  surrounded  with  a  remarkably  salubrious 
atmosphere;  its  large  body  of  buildings  is  isolated  from  the 
bordering  streets  on  the  N.  W.  and  S.  W  ,  by  vast  fruit  and 
vegetable  gardens,  which  are  agreably  ornamented  with  trees. 


2 

The  Foundress  and  first  Superior  from  1851  to  1874,  was 
Sister  Marie  de  JBonsecours.     Then  the  following  : 

2nd — Superior  :  Sr.  Ildefonse,  from  1874  to  IStT  ; 
3rd— Superior  :  Sr.  Marie- Victor,  from  1877  to  1879 ; 
4th— Superior  :  Sr.  Philippe  de  J^sus,  from  1879  to  1886  ; 
5th— Superior  :  Sr.  Marie  de  la  Merci,  from  1886  to  1889  ; 
eth^And  actual  Superior  :  Sr.  Charles  de  la  Providence, 
since  1889. 

Up  to  this  date,  the  Institution  has  admitted  739  pilpils 
who,  a  few  excepted,  have  received  a  sufficient  instruction  to  fill 
their  religious  and  social  duties.

"  PEESOISINBL  " 

OF     THE     INSTITUTION 

1. — Sisters. 

For  the  administration  and  teaching.  Sisters  of  Charity  of 

Providence 45 

Novices  and  Sisters  of  the  Congregation  of  Deaf  Mute 

Sisters 10 

Auxiliary  Sisters  (of  the  Third  Order) 12 

2. — Pupils  and  Asylum. 

The  Pemale  Deaf  and  Dumb  are  divided  into  three  great 

categories,  viz.  : 
lo     The  pupils  who  follow  the  pure  Intuitive  Oral  Method       83 
2o    The  pupils  who  follow  the  Intuitive  Manual  Method 
for  the  french  section,  and  the  Combined  Method  for 
the  english  section, 63 

To  these  must  be  added  the  pupils  who  follow  the  com- 

plemental  course  of  industry. 22 

3o  The  ancient  pupils  who,  for  need  of  protection,  remam 
in  the  Institution  after  their  initruction,  and  form  that 
department  called  the  "Asylum" 107 


These  three  categories  constitute  three  completely  distinct 
departments,  each  of  whicn  has  its  own  halls,  refect-' 
ories,  dormitories  and  play-grounds. 

•  3. — Religious  Service. 

The  religious  service  of  the  Institution  is  carried  on  by  two 

Chaplains  who  reside  in  the  establishment,  and  who  besides 

gather  every  Sunday  in  a  more  Central  House  of  the  Sisters  of 

Providence  the  Female  Deaf-Mutes  of  the  City,  and  give  them 

eligious  instructions. 

One  of  the  Chaplains  goes  to  Quebec  two  or  three  times  a 
year,  in  order  to  give  missions  and  religious  exercises  to  the  Deaf 
and  Dumb  of  that  City  and  of  the  surrounding  parishes.  And 
both  of  them  are  called  tbrouaih  the  whole  Province  to  supply 
the  Female  Deaf-Mutes  with  the  religious  helps  that  are  needed. 

4. — Medical  Sei-vice. 

The  medical  service  is  attended  to  by  two  physicians. 

And  lately,  a  regular  clinical  service  for  the  diseases  of  the 
ears,  nose  and  throat  has  been  established  in  the  Institution,  and 
is  also  intended  for  the  benefit  of  the,  pupils;  this  new  improv- 
ement has  already  given  excellent  results. 

Ill 

TEACHING 

1. — Its  end  and  spirit;  Admission;  Length  of  Studies. 

The  first  and  predominant  end  of  j  the  Institution  is  the 
teaching  of  Eeligion,  which  reveals  to  man  his  dignity  and 
destiny,  directs  him  in  his  relations  with  his  Creator  and  his 
fellow-creatures,  and  supplies  him  with  ^the  incitements  and 
consolations  necessary  to  meet  with  the  difficulties  of  life.  To 
put  this  moral  help  within  the  reach  of  all  the  unfortunate  Deaf 
and  Dumb  girls,  the  Institution  admits  even  those  who  are  in 
an  advanced  age. 


The  second  end  of  the  Institution  is  to  give  to  the  Female 

Deaf  and  Dumb  a  teaching  which  on  one  side  develops  their 

intelligence  and  enables  them  to  fill  the  duties  of  social  life,  and 

■on  the  other,  prepares  them  for  a  position  that  will  assure  their 

subsistence. '  • 

In  order  to  more  surely  reach  this  dovible  end,  the  Institution 
has  always  endeavored  to  give  to  its  teaching  all  possible 
l^erfection,  even  through  great  sacrifices.  The  Foundress,  with 
one  of  her  Sisters,  had  first  been  to  the  United-States  in  1853&gt;  to 
study  under  the  celebrated  professor  Isaac  Peet,  director  of  the 
JSTew-York  Deaf-Mutc  Institution  Washington  Heights.  After 
having  been  teaching  by  the  means  of  signs,  to  which  she  even 
added  some  trials  of  articulation,  she  crossed  to  Europe  in  1870, 
to  become  thoroughly  acquainted  Avich  the  so-called  Oral  Method 
w:hich  was  highly  praised  ;  and,  upon  her  return, — July  1870, — 
she  inaugurated  in  her  School  and  in  this  country  the  regular 
teaching  of  articulation  and  of  reading  on  the  lips,  which  even 
contributed  to  the  instruction  of  some  pupils  Later  on,  in 
1879,  the  Institution,  after  having  sent  a  delegate  to  Europe 
to  make  long  studies  of  the  various  methods,  finally  adopted  the 
pure  Oral  Method  in  its  full  rigor.  Since  then,  it  has  also  taken 
advantage  of  new  studies  and  observations  made  either  in  Europe 
or  in  the  United  States,  and  it  keeps  itself  always  acquainted 
with  all  the  new  trials  and  improvements  which  relate  to  the 
intellectual  and  industrial  training  of  the  Deaf  and  Dumb. 

Again  in  the  pursuit  of  this  double  end,  a  rather  maternal 
and  persuasive  system  of  rules  is  resorted  to,  in  order  that  the 
Deaf  and  Dumb  may  find  if  possible  iu  the  Institution  the  atten- 
tions and  sollicitudeof  their  absent  parents. 

The  regular  age  of  admission  is  9  years ;  in  some  cases 
however,  grievous  reasons  might  lead  to  the  admission  of  a  child 
under  that  age. 

For  the  safer  conveyance  of  the  children,  and  to  save 
expenses  and  trouble  to  parents,  every  year,  two  Sisters  of  the 
Institution  are  sent  to  Quebec,  either  to  take  along  with  them 
the  children  of  that  region  when  the  classes  open,  or  to  see  them 
oft"  when  the  classes  close. 

As  soon  as  possible,  a  special  department  is  intended  to  be 


created  for  the  benefit  of  those  children  who,  being  too  young  to 
follow  the  general  order  ot  the  Institution,  would  nevertheless 
be  able  to  commence  their  course  of  articulation  in  a  junior  class, 
and  in  the  mean  while  would  thereby  be  sheltered  from  so  many 
miseries  which  families  are  often  powerless  to  avert. 

The  regular  course  of  training  requires  8  years,  which  may- 
be followed  by  3  complemental  years  devoted  to  the  improving 
of  industrial  kncvledge. 

2.— Method. 

As  a  general  method,  the  teaching  is  given  in  a  thoroughly 
practical  and  eye-striking  manner,  by  means  of  persons,  actions 
things,  pictures  and  comparison.  i 

Two  essentially  difPei'ent  and  separate  methods  are  followed 
by  the  pUpils, — the  Oral  Method  and  the  Manual  Method. 

lo  The  Oral  Method  ;  education  of  the  hearing. 

The  Intuitive  pure  Oral  Method,  which  excludes  the  signs 
and  the  alphabet  of  the  fingers,  is  followed  in  its  full  rigor  in  the 
Institution.  It  first  trains  its  students  to  articulate  and  speak 
and  to  read  on  the  speaker's  lips,  then  it  teaches  them  viva  voce; 
it  employs  writing  only  as  secondary  means  and  to  help  the 
memory,  and  thereby  the  students  are  accustomed  to  attach 
ideas  directly  to  articulate  words,  — which  makes  their  speech 
more  spontaneous. 

This  Method  has  been  adopted  here  in  its  full  application  in 
1879  as  stated  above ;  it  then  composed  its  first  classes  of  the 
beginning  pupils,  and  of  some  others  who  had  already  commenced 
their  course,  and  acquired  sufficient  notions  of  articulation  and 
reading  on  the  lips  to  recite  their  lessons  and  receive  explana- 
tions'■  viva  voce".  Among  the  pupils  it  has  trained  up  to  this 
date,  we  know  60  who  after  their  studies  have  continued  to  make 
an  habitual  use  of  speech  in  their  relations  with  society 

The  Oral  Method  is  applied  even  to  students  of  narrow  un- 
derstanding and  advanced  age,  especially  when  there  is  a  hope 
that  they  can  remain  all  the  regular  time  :  for  the  results  even 
so  humble  that  they  obtain  from  it  set  them  nearer  to  the  hear- 
ing and  speaking  people  than  could  be  expected  from  any  other 


6 

method.  It  has  been  noticed  thatsome  pupils  who  had  followed 
the  oral  method  and  who  aftep  a  more  or  less  lengthy  interrup- 
tion of  their  studies  had  come  again  to  the  institution,  had  a 
more  spontaneous  although  less  distinct  speech,  and  had  enlar- 
ged the  range  of  their  knowledge  ;  this  had  never  been  observed 
here  in  so  high  a  degree  with  the  students  of  the  Mauual  Me- 
thod. 

As  an  improvement  to  the  oral  method  and  to  draw  the 
students  still  nearer  to  society,  the  education  ol  the  sense  of 
hearing  has  been  added  to  that  method  ;  the  Institution  has  two 
"Verrier  Audigenous"  and  various  ear-trumpets  :  with  or  with- 
out these  instruments,  according  to  cases,  every  day  in  several 
classes,  exercices  of  hearing  are  given  to  students  susceptible  of 
them  :  these  students  actually  number  37,  20  of  whom  have 
obtained  valuable  results,  which  may  also  be  expected  for  the 
others.     (See  Statistics). 

2o  Manual  Methojj  ;  combined  method. 

The  intuitive  Manual  or  Dactylological  Method  makes  use  of 
the  manual  alphabet  and  of  writing,  to  the  effect  of  connecting 
ideas  with  the  graphic  figures  ;  and  to  more  surely  reach  this 
end  the  method  is  applied  in  the  Institution  with  the  exclusion 
of  mimic  signs. 

The  Manual  Method  which  at  first,  owing  to  the  insufficient 
number  of  Oral  teachers,  had  to  be  followed  even  by  students 
who  might  liave  taken  advantage  of  the  oral  method,  is  now 
and  henceforth  resorted  to  only  for  those  pupils  who,  either  on 
account  of  advanced  age  or  debility,  or  other  causes,  —  cannot 
afford  to  stay  long  enough  to  learn  speech,  or  to  those  pupils 
whose  vocal  organs  are  so  affected  as  to  forbid  them  the  exerci- 
ses of  articulations;  thus  out  of  the  27  beginners  of  this  years  3 
t)nly  follow  the  Manual  Method. 

With  the  Manual  Method  can  bo  connected  the  Combined 
Method,  which  to  the  former  adds  the  use  of  speech  in  teaching. 
This  method — up  to  1879,  when  the  pure  oral  method  was  in- 
troduced— had  been  followed  by  a  good  many  pupils  who  acquired 
through  it  a  sufficient  practice  of  speech  to  be  able  to  enjoy  it 
afterwards  in  their  social  relations.  But  now,  it  is  exclusively 
applied  to  the  students  of  the  English  language,  and  it  proves  as 
Hiitisfactory  as  before. 


3o  Matters  of  Teaching. 
The  teaching  given  in  the  Institution  comprises  two  distinct 
branches.-  the  intellectual  and  the  Industrial  teaching — hence 
two  classes  of  matters. 

1. — Matters  of  the  intellectual  teaehing  : 

lo  Eeligion  and  Sacred  History. 

2o  The  French  or  the  English  language,  according  to  the  wish 

of  parents. 
3o  Grammar,  exercises  of  litterature  and  letter-writing. 
4o  Mental  and  graphic  arithmetic 
5o  Book  keeping,  (simple) . 
ffo  Geography  and  mapping. 
7o  Elements  of  N'atural  History,  Physiology  k  Physics,  specially 

with  regard  to  hygiene. 
80  History  of  Canada,  and  of  the  United  States,  a  few  notions 

of  general  history. 

2. — Matters  of  the  industrial  Teaehing. 

lo  All  the  domestic  works,  cooking,  washing,  ironing,  mending, 
etc.,  sometimes  gardening. 

2o  Various  kinds  of  sewing,  embroidering,  knitting,  weaving, 
cutting  and  making  clothes,  etc., 

3o  Drawing  and  painting,  specially  from  nature  :  various  pen- 
cil-drawing, decorative-painting,  oil-painting  on  porcelain  &amp; 
on  silk  ;  pastel,  water- color,  sepia. 

4o  Artificial  wax-flowers,  waxing  of  natural  flowers,  hair-work, 

00  Set-off  copper  working  ;  wood,  copper  and  stuff  relief  working. 

4. — Furniture  for  classes  and  industry ;  general 
Mnseum;  library. 

The  furniture  for  classes  comprises  a  large  variety  of 
objects. 

In  all  the  classes  each  pupil  has  her  own  table  and  chair 
adapted  to  her  size,  the.  table,  has  the  form  of  a  desk  and  incloses 
slates,  books,  copy-books,  etc. ;  on  the  highest  part  of  the  desk  a 
special  case  is  destined  to  the  inkstand,  pens  and  pencils ;  this 
ease  is  deep  enough,  and  its  cover  turns  up  and  upholds  the  text 
to  be  transcribed. 


Every  class  is  surrounded  inside  with  slate  or  slate-like  black- 
boards fitted  in  the  wainscots  ;  and  besides,  near  the  teacher, 
there  is  one  or  two  movable  wooden  black-boards. 

Above  those  boards  there  hangs  on  the  walls  a  great  varietj- 
of  colored  and  framed  pictures  showing  series  :  of  religious  sce- 
nes for  Sacred  History  and  Catechism,  and  of  scenes  of  domestic 
life  ;  the  various  processes  of  arts  and  trade  ;  animals,  plants, 
.minerals,  etc.  These  collections  come  from  Parisian  houses,  viz  : 
de  I'Assomption,  Hachette,  Delagrave  et  Bouasse-Lebel ;  also 
from  various  German  and  Flemish  houses,  etc.  These  pictures 
number  over  600  in  the  institution. 

Every  class  is  supplied,  specially  for  beginners,  with  a  little 
museum  that  contains  a  great  many  small  wares  destined  to  open 
and  develop  more  easily  the  intellect  of  the  children  and  to  in- 
crease their  vocabulary  ;  everything  may  be  seen  in  the  collec- 
tion, from  the  tiny  cat  and  paper  rabbit  to  the  most  simple 
utensils  of  usual  life,  coppers  and  tins,  beds,  furniture,  etc,  -  all 
this  little  stock  contributes  to  the  intuitive  teaching  of  things. 

On  the  walls  of  the  two  long  corridors  on  which  all  the 
classes  open,  over  50  beautiful  maps  are  hanging,  for  the  study 
of  history  and  geography. 

The  studio  of  drawing  and  painting  contains  a  large  variety 
of  models  :  models  after  the  great  masters,  such  as  Eaphael, 
etc ,  etc  ,  for  drawing,  or  Coreggio,  Landseer,  etc.,  for  oil- 
painting  ;  plaster  models  for  the  study  of  the  bust ;  books  of 
models  for  the  various  kinds  of  drawing,  several  treaties  by 
Smith,  etc. 

The  work  rooms  of  industrial  teaching  are  supplied  witli 
sewing  and  knitting  machines,  cards  and  spinning  wheels,  weav- 
ing looms,  frames  for  bedding,  for  cleansing  and  preparing  wool, 
etc. 

To  ail  that  furniture  must  be  added  several  maps  of  tlio 
Natural  History  collection  of  Deyrolles,  then  the  industrial 
museum  of  Dorangeon  in  12  cards,  each  of  which  shows  forty  or 
fifty  samples.  These  maps,  together  with  a  good  many  essays  in 
painting,  some  collections  in  ornithology,  numismatics,  minera- 
logy, etc.,  numerous  stereoscopic  views  of  European  large  citiesand 


monuments,   etc.  — are   the   first   articles  of  a  general  Museum 
■which  is  intended  to  serve  as  a  complement  to  the  class  furniture. 

The  text-books  comprise :  large  reading-maps,  showing 
the  process  to  be  followed  in  demutisation  ;  numerous  French 
and  English  treaties  on  pronounciation  ,  reading  on  the  lips, 
teaching  of  those  languages.  Besides,  several  foreign  English 
or  French  reviews  and  papers  with  regard  to  the  instruction  of 
the  Deaf  and  Dumb  are  received  in  the  institution. 

The  Library  has  about  2000  volumes,  a  fair  number  of 
which  are  destined  to  the  instruction  and  amusement  of  the  Deaf 
and  Dumb. 

IV 

HYGIENE    AND   GYMNASTICS. 

An  extreme  attention  is  given  to  hygiene  in  the  Institution. 
AH  the  rooms  for  the  use  of  the  Students,  such  as  school-rooms, 
recreation-halls,  refectories,  dormitories,  chapel,  are  vast,  receive 
light  through  large  windows,  are  supplied  with  excellent  heat- 
ing and  ventilating  systems. 

Besides  the  dormitories,  little  bed-rooms  have  been  prepared 
near  the  recreation-halls,  into  which  rooms  the  students,  special- 
ly beginners,  who  may  feel  tired  during  day-time  can  go  and 
rest. 

.  The  play-groundg  destined  for  out  door  recreations  are 
fine  and  large,  and  during  bad  weather  they  can  be  supplied  to 
by  the  long  outside  galleries  which  run  around  the  building  : 
specially  on  the  class-flat  these  galleries  are  enjoyed  to'  spend  the 
few  moments  of  recess  which  interrupt  the  hours  of  class. 

Every  week  or  so,  all  the  pupils  go  out  for  a  walk  which  is 
a  benefit  both  to  their  body  and  mind. 

Gymnastics  is  in  great  favor :  besides  the  particular  exercises 
required  in  some  classes,  three  times  a  week  the  pupils  are  given 
gymnastic  lessons  and  exercises,  which  do  not  only  develop  their 
physical  strength  and  rest  them  from  study,  but  contribute  also 
to  their  intellectual  education  by  exerting  their  faculty  of  obser- 
Tation  on  the  various  series  of  actions. 


10 
GENEEAL  OBSBEVATION. 

We  cannot  close  this  skort  Notice  without  including  a  few 
remarks  with  regard  to  the  exhibits  of  the  pupils  at  the  Coluni- 
Wan  Exposition, 

The  only  merit  of  these  exhibits  is  that  they  give,  as  near 
as  possible,  an  exact  idea  of  the  methods  of  teaching  followed  in 
the  Institution. 

Through  the  "s^ritten  copy-books,  it  has  been  intended  to 
make  visible  the  intellectual  teaching, — that  is  the  means  em- 
ployed to  develop  the  slumbering  intelligence  of  the  unfortunate 
Deaf  and  Dumb, — and,  as  if  to  say,  to  give  photographic  report 
of  the  teaching  in  each  class.  It  must  be  added  here  that, — 
owing  to  the  great  variety  of  age  and  to  the  difference  of  lan- 
guage of  the  students,  and  to  the  multiplication  of  courses  occa- 
sioned thereby  in  spite  of  the  rather  small  number  of  those  stu- 
dents, the  success  of  the  teaching  has  not  yet  reached  the  high 
degree  which  may  be  aimed  at,  and  which  will  certainly  be 
reached  when  the  pupils  will  come  to  the  Institution  at  a  more 
uniform  age,  and  will  then  give  rise  to  less  difficulty  of  classifi- 
cation . 

The  manual  works  of  sewing,  drawing,  etc.,  are  destined  to 
show  how  the  industrial  teaching  given  in  the  Institution  pre- 
pares the  students  to  provide  by  themselves  in  the  future  to  their 
own  subsistence. 

May  then  those  humble  exhibits  obtain  the  intended  results, 
and  the  labors  they  have  occasioned  will  be  largely  rewarded  ! !

The    Halifax    Institution    for    the 
Deaf  and  Dumb, 


HALIFAX,  NOVA  SCOTIA, 
1857-1893. 


Hv     JAMES     F  E  A  li  O  N  , 

Pniicipjl  of  the  Iiislilution. 


THE  HALIFAX  INSTITUTION  FOE  THE  DEAF  AND 

DUMB. 

The  best  possible  history  that  can  be  given  of  this  Institu- 
tion is  that  which  appears  in  the  Twentieth  Report,  written  by 
the  late  principal,  J.  Scott  Hutton,  M.  A.,  who  may  be  said  to 
have  laid  the  foundation-stone  and  added  piece  by  piece  to  the 
structure,  amid  difficulties  and  discouragements  such  as  are 
met  with  in  a  new  and  comparatively  poor  country,  with  that 
indefatigable  energy  and  zeal  for  which  he  was  so  well  known 
throughout  the  profession.  He  watched  over  its  infancy  with 
all  the  care  and  tenderness  of  a  parent ;  he  rejoiced  in  its  in- 
creasing strength,  and  labored  unceasingly  until  he  brought 
it  to  that  state  of  efficiency  in  which  it  is  found  to-day — fully 
capable  of  supplying  the  educational  wants  of  the  class  ia 
whose  interest  it  was  established. 

The  following  extract  from  the  Eeport  above  referred  to 
gives  in  detail  the  progress  and  history  of  the  Institution  up 
to  the  year  1877  : 

Thirty-six  years  ago  there  was  no  provision  within  the  Maritime 
Provinces  of  this  country  for  the  education  of  the  hundreds  of  mutes 
who,  with  scarcely  an  exception,  were  utterly  destitute  of  instruction, 
passing  through  life  in  a  condition  of  the  saddest  mental  and  moral  dark- 
ness, ignorant  alike  of  their  nature,  their  duty,  and  their  destiny.  In  a 
few  instances  legislative  aid  had  enabled  parents  to  send  their  mute 
children  to  the  States  for  the  instruction  unattainable  at  home,  but  how 
little  was  accomplished  in  this  way  may  be  seen  from  the  fact  that, 
during  the  long  period  of  fifty  years,  the  whole  number  of  mutes  re- 
ceived into  the  Hartford  Asylum  from  the  British  Provinces  was  only 
twenty-five,  and  of  these  not  more  than  six  were  supported  by  the 
Provincial  legislatures.  Of  the  twenty-five,  11  were  from  Nova  Scotia, 
5  from  Canada  East,  5  from  Canada  West,  and  4  from  New  Brunswick. 
Some  Provincial  deaf-mutes  may  have  been  educated  during  that  period 
at  other  institutions  in  the  States  besides  Hartford,  and  a  few  certainly 
— two  at  least  from  Nova  Scotia — in  the  schools  of  the  mother  country, 
but,  in  all  probability,  the  entire  number  of  British-American  mutes  who 
had  enjoyed  the  blessing  of  education  since  the  commencement  of  the 
century  would  not  exceed  thirty  or  forty. 

It  is  worthy  of  note  that  of  the  whole  number  of  mutes  from  the 
British  Provinces  mentioned  as  receiving  instruction  in  the  Hartford 
School,  previous  to  the  opening  of  institutions  for  their  benefit  nearer 
home  and  on  their  own  soil,  nearly  one-half  were  from  one  of  the  smaller, 
less  populous,  and  least  known,  though  by  no  means  the  least  important 


4  The  Halifax  Institution. 

colony — the  Province  of  Nova  Scotia.  There  is  also  reason  to  believe 
that  the  six  stated  to  have  been  supported  by  the  Provinces  were  all 
beneficiaries  of  the  legislature  of  Nova  Scotia. 

These  circumstances,  while  indicative  of  an  earlier  awakening  to  the 
claims  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  than  in  the  more  populous  and  wealthy 
sister  Provinces,  are  also  in  harmony  with  the  interesting  fact  that  the 
earliest  advocate  of  deaf-mute  education  on  the  American  continent, 
Francis  Green,  author  of  the  work  entitled  "  Vox  Oculis  Subjecta,"  pub- 
lished in  London  in  1783,  giving  an  account  of  Braidwood's  school  in 
Edinburgh,  if  not  by  birth  a  Nova  Scotian,  was  yet  identified  with  this 
Province  both  by  education  and  official  position  for  many  years,  being 
engaged  in  military  duty  in  Halifax  and  other  parts  of  the  Province  pre- 
vious to  the  outbreak  of  the  Revolutionary  war,  and  subsequently  hold- 
ing the  position  of  high  sheriff  of  Halifax  county.  About  the  beginning 
of  this  century  Mr.  Green  was  residing  in  Medford,  Mass.,  where  he 
appears  to  have  devoted  his  leisure  hours  to  advocating  in  the  journals 
the  importance  of  educating  the  deaf  and  dumb,  and  endeavoring  to 
enlist  public  sympathy  in  their  behalf.  Some  of  his  articles  may  be 
found  in  the  Boston  papers,  particularly  the  New  England  Palladium  for 
the  year  1793.  The  first  attempt  at  an  enumeration  or  census  of  the 
deaf-mutes  of  Massachusetts  and  the  United  States  was  also  due  to  Mr. 
Green's  instrumentality. 

His  son,  Charles  Green,  the  first  educated  deaf-mute  of  American 
birth,  was  a  pupil  of  Braidwood,  in  his  articulating  school  in  Edinburgh, 
from  1780  to  1786,  and,  according  to  his  father's  account  in  the  "  Vox 
Oculis  Subjecta,"  attained  remarkable  proficiency  both  in  articulate 
speech  and  in  scholarship.  This  young  man  was  unfortunately  drowned, 
shortly  after  completing  his  education,  while  shooting  wild  fowl  on  Cole 
Harbor,  in  the  neighborhood  of  Halifax.  Nova  Scotia  thus  appears  to 
claim  an  early  and  special  connection  with  the  cause  of  deaf-mute  educa- 
tion in  America. 

The  history  and  progress  of  the  Halifax  Institution,  while  presenting 
many  tokens  of  divine  goodness,  afford  an  encouraging  illustration  of 
what  may  be  accomplished  by  patient,  steady,  persevering,  and  yet  quiet 
and  unostentatious  effort.  Obscure  and  humble  in  its  origin,  this  work 
was  not  ushered  into  existence  amid  the  "  pomp  and  circumstance  of  pub- 
lic demonstration,  the  smiles  of  wealth,  the  patronage  of  rank,"  or  the 
plaudits  of  enthusiastic  multitudes.  Small,  feeble,  and  insignificant  in 
its  beginnings,  appealing  to  none  of  those  sentiments  of  national  honor 
or  personal  interest  which  exercise  so  large  an  infiuence  in  the  inception 
and  prosecution  of  many  enterprises  even  of  a  benevolent  character,  the 
Halifax  Institution  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb  has  gradually  emerged  into 
the  light  of  public  favor,  and  attained  a  position  of  usefulness  and  re- 
spectability such  as  its  most  sanguine  friends  oould,  perhaps,  hardly  have 
anticipated.  Meeting,  as  it  does,  an  important  and  acknowledged  want  in 
the  community,  it  may  now  be  fairly  regarded  as  an  accomplished  fact — 
one  of  the  permanent  institutions  of  the  country. 

The  Halifax  Institution  owes  its  origin,  incidentally,  to  Mr.  William 
Gray,  a  deaf-mute,  and  a  pupil  of  the  well-known  Mr.  Kinniburgh,  of  the 
Edinburgh  Institution.     Emigrating  from  Scotland,  presumably  with  the 


The  Halifax  Institution.  5 

expectation  of  making  a  fortune  in  the  New  World,  like  others  of  his 
compatriots,  Mr.  Gray  was  landed,  by  stress  of  circumstances,  at  Halifax 
in  the  month  of  August,  1855,  and  after  working  for  some  time  at  his 
trade  of  tailoring,  being  thrown  out  of  employment,  he  conceived  or  had 
suggested  to  him  by  a  brother  mute  and  fellow-countryman  who  hap- 
pened to  be  also  residing  in  Halifax  the  idea  of  opening  a  school  for  the 
deaf  and  dumb  as  a  means  of  subsistence. 

His  advertisement  attracted  the  attention  of  Kev.  James  C.  Cochran, 
D.  D.,  the  venerable  and  devoted  secretary  of  the  Institution,  who  imme- 
diately sought  him  out,  and  found  him  in  a  mean  lodging  in  a  poor  street, 
engaged  in  teaching  one  or  two  mutes,  the  place  being  destitute  of  the 
common  comforts  and  even  necessaries  of  life.  Mr.  Cochran's  interest  in 
the  deaf  and  dumb  had  been  first  awakened,  many  years  before,  by  meet- 
ing, on  board  an  American  steamboat,  with  the  celebrated  Laurent  Clerc, 
and  accordingly  he  now  set  himself  to  enlist  the  sympathies  of  other  be- 
nevolent persons  in  Halifax  on  behalf  of  the  neglected  deaf-mutes  of  his 
native  Province,  an  object  in  which  he  was  providentially  successful. 
Along  with  Andrew  Mackinlay,  Esq.,  custos  of  the  county,  and  for  many 
years  afterwards  the  esteemed  chairman  of  the  board  of  directors,  he 
succeeded  in  obtaining  for  the  infant  cause  the  notice  and  support  of  the 
legislature  and  the  community,  organized  a  board  of  management,  and 
took  other  steps  for  the  proper  establishment  and  equipment  of  the  school. 

The  first  legislative  aid  was  a  grant  of  $1,200  in  the  spring  of  1857,  the 
grant,  in  subsequent  years,  being  enlarged  to  f  1,600  and  $2,000,  as  the 
value  and  claims  of  the  object  became  better  understood.  This,  with  the 
voluntary  contributions  readily  obtained,  enabled  the  promoters  of  the 
infant  Institution  to  provide  more  suitable  accommodation  for  the  school, 
a,nd  to  engage  Mr.  J.  Scott  Hutton,  then  and  for  ten  years  previously  an 
instructor  in  the  Edinburgh  Institution,  as  principal,  Mr.  Gray  being  re- 
tained as  assistant  teacher. 

Bringing  from  Scotland  the  needful  books  and  apparatus  for  the  work 
kindly  donated  by  kindred  institutions  in  the  mother  country — to  the 
value  of  about  $200— Mr.  Hutton  entered  on  his  duties  in  Halifax  on  the 
4th  of  August,  1857,  with  four  pupils.  The  year  following,  the  attendance 
having  increased  to  twenty-seven,  additional  accommodation  was  pro- 
cured, a  matron  engaged,  and  the  general  management  then,  for  the  first 
time,  placed  in  the  hands  of  the  principal  and  matron,  who  henceforward 
resided  in  the  same  building  with  the  pupils,  the  school  previously  being 
only  a  day-school,  with  three  or  four  of  the  boys  boarding  in  the  house 
of  the  assistant  teacher,  and  others  with  friends  in  the  city. 

At  the  close  of  the  first  regular  session  of  the  school,  as  an  organized 
institution,  in  July,  1858,  a  public  meeting  on  its  behalf  was  held  in  the 
Mechanics'  Institute,  presided  over  by.  A.  Mackinlay,  Esq.,  president  of 
the  board,  and  attended  by  the  Bishop  of  Nova  Scotia  and  other  promi- 
nent citizens,  when,  for  the  first  time  before  a  Halifax  audience,  an  exhi- 
bition of  the  method  and  results  of  deaf-mute  instruction  was  given  in 
the  examination  of  the  pupils,  which  brought  the  condition  and  claims 
of  the  deaf  and  dumb  more  impressively  before  the  community,  and  gave 
a  valuable  impulse  to  the  new  cause. 

During  the  summer  vacation  immediately  following,  the  principal, 


6  The  Halifax  Institution. 

accompanied  by  several  of  the  pupils,  undertook  the  first  of  a  series  of 
annual  tours  in  the  Provinces  of  Nova  Scotia,  New  Brunswick,  and  Prince 
Edward  Island,  addressing  public  meetings  and  holding  exhibitions  on 
behalf  of  the  Institution,  in  the  principal  towns  and  villages,  with  grati- 
fying results  in  the  awakening  of  interest  in  a  department  of  benevolent 
effort  new  to  the  great  body  of  the  people,  the  accession  of  new  pupils, 
and  the  replenishing  of  the  funds. 

The  first  spontaneous  movement  in  the  Province  in  aid  of  the  Institu- 
tion took  place  on  the  historic  shores  of  Cobequid  Bay,  among  the 
intelligent  and  thriving  population  of  Noel,  in  the  county  of  Hants, 
where  a  bazaar  was  held  in  July  of  this  year,  at  which  the  principal  and 
several  of  the  pupils  were  present  by  invitation — an  occasion  memorable 
to  the  writer  as  the  first  on  which  he  had  the  privilege  of  advocating 
the  claims  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  before  a  rural  audience  in  the  Maritime 
Provinces.  About  two  hundred  and  fifty  dollars  was  realized  by  this — 
under  all  the  circumstances  a  most  creditable  and  cheering  result. 

In  November  of  the  same  year  (1858)  the  proceeds — amounting  to 
f  1,600 — of  a  bazaar  in  Halifax,  under  the  patronage  of  the  Countess 
of  Mulgrave,  lady  of  His  Excellency  the  Lieut. -Governor,  enabled  the 
directors  to  purchase  the  premises,  previously  rented ;  but,  in  the  ensu- 
ing year,  embracing  a  favorable  opportunity,  the  property  was  disposed 
of  by  the  board,  and  in  August,  1859,  the  present  premises,  formerly 
known  as  Brunswick  Villa,  commanding  a  magnificent  view  of  the  noble 
harbor  and  surrounding  country,  were  purchased  for  six  thousand  and 
four  hundred  dollars,  a  step  which  proved  highly  advantageous  to  the 
interests  of  the  Institution. 

On  the  17th  of  February,  1859,  a  second  exhibition  of  the  school  was 
held  in  the  Mechanics'  Institute  to  a  crowded  and  deeply  interested  audi- 
ence, and,  by  request,  repeated  on  the  14th  of  March  in  the  Temperance 
Hall,  the  largest  public  hall  in  the  city,  which  was  filled  to  its  capacity 
by  a  congregation  representing  all  classes  and  creeds  in  the  community, 
drawn  together  by  the  rapidly  growing  interest  felt  in  the  work. 

During  the  legislative  session,  the  same  spring,  we  had  the  honor  of 
giving  our  first  exhibition  before  the  members  of  both  branches  of  the 
legislature,  on  the  floors  of  the  House  of  Assembly,  to  which,  in  connec- 
tion with  similar  exhibitions  in  subsequent  sessions,  may  be  justly  at- 
tributed the  promotion  of  that  spirit  of  hearty  liberality  uniformly  dis- 
played by  the  legislature  of  Nova  Scotia  towards  the  Institution. 

In  the  spring  of  1860  the  teaching  staff  was  strengthened  by  the  acces- 
sion of  the  principal's  father,  Mr.  Geo.  Hutton,  for  nearly  forty  years 
engaged  in  the  instruction  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  in  Scotland.  Mr. 
Hutton  removed  with  his  family  to  Nova  Scotia  in  response  to  his  son's 
pressing  invitation  and  appeal  for  aid  at  a  time  when  the  fimds  were 
inadequate  to  meet  the  expense  of  an  additional  salaried  teacher  urgently 
required,  and  for  ten  years,  till  his  death  in  1870,  gave  his  voluntary 
services  to  the  Institution  without  stated  remuneration. 

In  1862  an  act  of  incorporation  was  obtained  from  the  legislature  for 
the  greater  stability  of  the  Institution. 

Additions  and  improvements  on  the  premises  have  been  made  from 
time  to  time  to  meet  the  growing  necessities  of  the  work.     In  1864:-'5  a 


The  Halifax  Institution.  7 

new  school-room  and  dormitory  were  added  to  the  building,  with  other 
improvements,  at  a  cost  of  over  $3,000.  And,  again,  in  1874  extensive 
alterations  and  additions  were  made,  including  hospital  accommodations 
and  heating  apparatus,  at  an  expense  of  about  $9,000.  These  changes 
have  about  doubled  the  original  extent  of  the  building,  besides  provid- 
ing for  the  increased  comfort  and  efficiency  of  the  establishment. 

In  1878,  Mr.  Hutton  resigned  his  position  as  principal  of 
the  Halifax  Institution  to  accept  that  of  vice-principal  of  the 
Institution  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb,  Belfast,  Ireland,  where  he 
labored  for  over  four  years  with  great  success.  He  was  suc- 
ceeded at  Halifax  by  Mr.  A.  F.  Woodbridge,  who  afterwards 
established  an  institution  in  Fredericton,  New  Brunswick. 
The  loss  which  the  Halifax  Institution  sustained  by  Mr.  Hut- 
ton's  leaving  was  more  than  compensated  by  his  work  in  Bel- 
fast. Language-teaching  took  the  place  of  grinding  in  set 
subjects,  firm  discipline  was  established,  and  the  manners  and 
morals  of  the  pupils  underwent  a  complete  change. 

In  1882,  after  accomplishing  what  was  really  a  missionary 
work,  performed  in  a  truly  Christian  spirit,  at  the  earnest  re- 
quest of  the  directors  in  Halifax  he  returned  to  the  scene  of 
his  form.er  labors,  where  he  continued  to  work  with  ever- 
increasing  success  until  1891,  when  his  career  was  terminated 
by  death — a  career  distinguished  by  enthusiasm,  ability,  self- 
sacrifice,  and,  above  all,  earnest  devotion  to  the  temporal  and 
eternal  welfare  of  those  committed  to  his  charge.  The  history 
of  the  Institution,  with  its  rise  and  progress,  constitutes  a  full 
biography  of  J.  Scott  Hutton. 

At  the  invitation  of  the  directors,  Mr.  James  Fearon,  the 
present  principal,  a  teacher  in  the  Royal  Institution  for  the 
Deaf,  Birmingham,  accepted  the  position  of  successor  to  Mr. 
Hutton,  entering  on  his  duties  in  September,  1891.  Mr.  Fearon 
began  the  work  of  teaching  the  deaf  under  Mr.  Hutton  in 
Belfast,  where  he  remained  for  over  seven  years,  afterwards 
occupying  similar  positions  in  ,  Margate  and  Birmingham, 
England. 

In  1867  the  Institution  lost  a  warm  friend  in  the  death  of 
Mr.  Andrew  Mackinlay,  who  had  been  connected  with  the 
work  from  its  inception,  and  who  did  much  to  introduce  it  to 
the  notice  and  support  of  the  community.  His  name,  with 
that  of  the  Hon.  Sec.  Rev.  J.  C.  Cochran,  was  appended  to  the 
first  public  appeal  for  funds,  which,  through  his  influence 
and  reputation,  was  so  generously  responded  to.  He  was  a 
man  of  sterling  worth,  recognized  ability,  and  extensive  use-

fulness.  In  the  same  yeai',  the  Institution  was  deprived  of  an 
able  treasurer  in  the  demise  of  Mr.  John  Duffus,  who  had 
also  been  associated  with  the  Institution  from  its  commence- 
ment. Three  years  later,  in  1870,  the  directors  were  called 
upon  to  perform  the  mournful  duty  of  recording  the  death  of 
Mr.  George  Hutton,  father  of  Principal  Hutton,  who  had 
come  over  from  Scotland  to  assist  his  son  in  his  arduous  un- 
dertaking, giving  his  valuable  services  for  many  years  gratu- 
itously.    He  was  a  man  of  large  benevolence,  original  genius

as  well  as  force  of  character,  yet,  withal,  modest  and  retiring 
in  his  disposition  and  unflagging  in  his  zeal.  Cheerful  and 
trusting  in  the  gloomiest  circumstances,  and  with  unbounded 
faith  in  Divine  Providence,  his  life  was  one  of  self-sacrifice 
and  of  long  devotion  to  the  cause  of  the  deaf  and  dumb. 

In  1875  Mr.  Charles  Murdock,  for  many  years  director  and 
chairman,  was  called  to  his  reward.  The  deep  interest  which 
he  took  in  the  deaf  was  shared  alike  by  his  family,  his  brother 
having  bestowed  the  munificent  legacy  of  $20,000,  whereby 
the  Institution  was  established  for  the  first  time  on  a  firm 
basis.     The  death  of  this  director  left  the  Eev.  J.  C.  Cochi-an, 


The  Halifax  Institution.  9 

the  venerable  secretary  of  the  Institution,  the  sole  survivor 
of  the  original  board,  and  he,  five  years  later,  after  tvrenty- 
three  years'  connection  with  the  establishment,  vras  also  gath- 
ered to  his  fathers.  His  ample  reports  shovs^  how  deeply  he 
was  interested  in  the  work  to  which  he  gave  the  first  impetus 
and  which  he  was  largely  instrumental  in  establishing.  He  was 
succeeded  by  the  present  secretary,  Eev.  Dr.  Forrest,  president 
of  Dalhousie  College,  who,  though  burdened  with  the  heavy 
responsibility  of  his  own  position,  as  well  as  the  religious,  be- 
nevolent, and  social  matters  in  which  he  takes  so  active  a  part, 
still  bestows  much  time  and  attention  upon  the  Institution, 
and  is  ever  ready,  when  called  upon,  to  give  his  valuable  coun- 
sel and  assistance  in  the  management. 

The  Honorable  D.  McNeil  Parker,  M.  L.  C,  has  been  asso- 
ciated with  the  Institution  for  over  thirty-four  years  as  honorary 
physician,  and  at  present  as  chairman  of  the  board.  His  con- 
nection dates  back  to  within  two  years  of  the  establishment 
of  the  school,  and  notwithstanding  his  professional  and  polit- 
ical duties,  as  well  as  benevolent  work  connected  with  various 
philanthropic  institutions,  he  still  finds  time  to  devote  to  the 
interests  of  the  school  for  the  deaf,  and  in  spite  of  advancing 
age  makes  a  point  of  being  present  at  almost  every  meeting 
of  the  board.

THE     ONTARIO    INSTITUTION. 


BY    PAUL    DENYS,    BELLEVILLE. 


There  is  in  every  human  heart 

Some  expectant,  workable  part, 

Where  seeds  of  love  and  truth  might  grow. 

And  iiowers  of  generous  virtue  blow; 

To  plant,  to  watch,  to  water  there — 

This  be  our  duty — be  our  care ! 

Every  age  boasts  its  own  special  achievements.  Whether 
it  be  in  the  fields  of  valor  or  the  avenues  of  art  and  learning; 
whether  in  mechanical  progress  or  scientific  discovery ;  what 
man,  mind,  inquirj'  unearths,  unravels,  unfolds,  the  annals  of 
fame,  in  their  good  time,  proudly  proclaim.  And  whilst  we 
may  with  wonder  dwell  upon  dauntless  daring,  pause  before 
the  seeming  endless  march  of  human  genius,  watch  with 
keenest  interest  all  the  developments  of  modern  research  and 
study,  there  is  one  attainment,  one  exploit,  one  triumph  which 
to-day  stands  out  in  single,  sublime  splendor — one  that  lifts 
itself  high  above  all  that  this  century,  rich  as  it  has  been  in 
skilled  accomplishments,  can  show — one  that  the  humane, 
the  good,  the  noble  shall  not  cease  to  exalt  in,  rejoice  in  and 
give  praise  for :  the  emancipation,  deliverance,  redeeming,  by 
heroic  efforts,  of  the  great  silent  family  from  the  prison  of 
darkness,  the  shackles  of  forced  isolation,  the  slumbers  of  an 
intellectual  night,  the  famine  of  a  l;ungering  and  thirsting 
soul !  .  .  The  sun  that  first  broke  upon  the  humble  home 
of  Montmarte,  that  later  touched  our  shore  with  one  of  its 


ONTAEIO    INSTITUTION    FOE 


gleams  and  is  now  shining  full  over  both  continents  has,  it 
is  conceived,  brought  glad  hope  to  many  an  anxious,  loving 
heart.  And  why  so  glad?  .  .  Ah!  Have  we,  upon  whom 
nature  has  lavished  all  her  choicest  gifts,  ever  given  a 
thought  to  the  poor  dear  ones  from  whom  the  unspeakable 
blessings  of  speech  and  hearing  were  withheld  ?  Have  we 
not  time  and  again  seen  the  big,  warm  tear  rolling  down  a 
parent's  cheek  in  the  sight  of  the  afflicted  offspring?  Has 
not  the  bright  eye  of  some  silent  child  as  his  glance,  full  of 
appeal,  rested  upon  you,  awakened  an  echo  in  your  inmost 
feelings?  Has  not  your  heart  gone  out  to  those  poor,  inno- 
cent little  ones  as  their  tiny  hand  was  extended  to  you  at, 
perhaps,  a  father's  bidding?  There  they  were  bright,  young, 
yet  captive,  and  you  would  almost  imagine — imploring  with 
their  look  your  reclaiming  action  in  their  behalf — awaiting 
the  "ephatha"  that  was  to  open  their  mind  to  light,  loosen 
their  chains  and  bring  them  to  our  society  and  companion- 
ship. Yes,  we  have  seen  and  felt  all  that  and  rejoiced  this 
age  could  boast  the  grandest  conquest  christian  heroism 
and  love,  philanthropy  and  zeal  could  inscribe  upon  their 
standards!  And  if  the  light  brought  was  in  proportion  to 
the  darkness  that  hitherto  prevailed,  one  will  easily  under- 
stand the  joy  with  which  the  breaking  beams  of  hope  were 
saluted. 

We  need  not  here  recall  how  Greece  and  Rome,  Aristotle 
and  Lucretius  looked  upon  these  disinherited  of  nature,  nor 
allude  to  the  causes  which  in  biblical  times,  were  believed 
to  preclude  speech.  .  .  Was  it  not  the  late  General 
Butler  gave  it  out  that  a  deaf-mute  at  best  was  but  half  a 
man  ?  .  .  Add  to  that  the  early  testimony  of  Augustine, 
who  would  make  faith  depend  on  the  possession  of  hearing 
and  all  the  other  negative  appreciations  that,  at  various 
times,  were  passed  upon  these  ostracised  beings  and  you  will 
not  wonder  at  the  world  rejoicing  when,  as  in  the  days  of 
miracles,  the  news  was  not  less  wonderfully  proclaimed,  "the 
Deaf  hear  and  the  Dumb  speak." 

Confidence,  says  Locke,  will  carry  us  through  many  a 
difficulty ;  and  when  that  persuasion  is  supported  by  power 
of  mind  and  fed  with  noble  impulse,  be  the  task  ever  so 
arduous,  it  eventually  must  yield.  It  was  no  doubt  under 
the  incentive  of   similar   reflections   heightened  by  burning

charity  that  the  great  De  L'Epee,  rising  equal  to'  his 
sublime  mission,  "built  himself  an  everlasting  name"  when 
he  severed,  as  with  Orlando's  sword,  the  thousand  ties  of 
past  impossibilities  from  the  car  of  future  triumph.  Skill 
and  benevolence  made  one,  brought  forth  the  regenerative 
principle  that  obtains  to-day  throughout  the  civilized  world,

able  direction.  And  here  we  may  well  ask  why  the  sum  of 
$80,000  voted  some  years  before  by  the  old  Canadian  Parlia- 
ment towards  the  erection  of  an  asylum  for  the  deaf  and 
dumb  and  the  blind  in  Upper  Canada,  was  never  expended? 
The  only  apparent  reason  may  be  sought  in  the  complica- 
tions and  political  changes  of  those  times  and  the  engrossing 
of  the    public   mind   therewith.     It    was  not  long,  however.

before  a  better  day  dawned  for  the  cause  in  this  part.  Mr. 
John  Barrett  McGann,  a  man  of  scholarly  attainments  and 
benevolent  nature,  in  1858,  opened,  at  great  personal 
sacrifices,  a  school  in  Toronto,  in  which  many  prominent 
citizens  soon  became  interested.  As  the  commencements 
of  a  work  of  this  kind  are  always  trying,  many  were  the 
difficulties  encountered.  In  1864,  Mr.  McGann  removed 
his  school  to  Hamilton,  where  he  met  with  more  generous 
support,     Public    attention    had   now   been    aroused   and  a

grand  move,  one  worthy  the  Banner  Province  of  the 
Dominion,  was  made,  which  resulted  in  the  establishing  at 
Belleville,  in  1870,  of  the  Ontario  Institution  which  stands 
to-day  a  monument  of  the  liberality  of  the  people  as  well  as 
a  credit  to  the  profession.     Ontario  does  nothing  by  halves.

Less  prompt  than  her  sister-provinces,  when  she  realized 
that  the  time  for  her  had  come  to  execute  the  grand  work, 
she  set  to  it  with  a  will,  a  munificence  that  rivalled  similar 
efforts  in  any  clime.  A  large  tract  of  land  was  purchased 
in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  Belleville — a  pretty,  young 
city  with  a  fair  name  and  fairer  people — and  a  majestic 
building  was  seen  to  rise  on  a  commanding  spot,  casting 
its  imposing  proportions  upon  the  placid  waters  of  far-

establishments  of  the  kind  in  the  United  States  and  Canada, 
whilst  in  effectiveness,  generous  provision,  careful  manage- 
ment and  general  results  we  have  the  ambition  to  believe 
ourselves  second  to  none, 


12  ONTARIO    INSTITUTION    FOR 

In  1879,  Dr.  Palmer  resigned,  being  succeeded  by  Mr.  R. 
Mathison,  the  present  Principal  of  the  School.  A  ship, 
however  gallant  and  trim,  shall  not  long  ride  the  waves  unless 
properly  manned.  At  the  first  wind  she  shall  be  dashed  on 
the  rocks  if  a  helmsman  prudent,  wise,  vigilant  stand  not 
steadfast  at  his  post.  Modesty,  therefore,  will  not  deter  a 
word  of  appreciation.  The  now  fourteen  years  of  Mr. 
Mathison's  rule  over  the  Institution  have  completely,  un- 
reservedly been  devoted  to  the  public  trust  ruling  confidence 
was  pleased  to  assign  him — a  trust  to  the  discharge  of  which 
he,  be  it  said  here,  has  brought  unswerving  loyalty,  talent 
and  credit.  The  bows  of  the  ship  were,  with  no  deviation, 
kept  pointing  to  the  port  of  the  children's  good.  Storms, 
torn  sheets,  battered  sides  never  yet  hindered  a  sailor  bold 
from  landing  his  men  in  the  desired  haven.  Not  to  speak 
of  others  who  have  given  no  uncertain  sounds,  the  hundreds 
of  children  who  took  passage  with  us  on  the  ever  perilous 
scholastic  voyage  will  bear  pleasing  testimony  to  the 
exceptional  sailing  qualities  of  our  brave  craft,  her  steadiness 
and  speed  and  general  efficient  command. 

Br.t  if  the  captain  is  brave,  are  not  his  men?  A  late 
distinguished  visitor,  vividly  impressed  with  what  he  saw, 
paid  the  school  this  ver3f  high  tribute:  "From  time  to  time 
the  staff  has  been  changed  until  now  it  seems  impossible  to 
improve  it."  Sweet  as  this  is  to  our  ears,  we  shall  not  cross 
our  arms  content  with  past  laurels,  or  sit  down  and  weep  at 
no  more  worlds  to  conquer.  Amphion  with  his  13're  could 
charm  the  stones  into  the  walls  of  Thebes,  but  there  is  no 
such  magic  for  a  teacher  of  the  deaf.  Unsparing  devotion, 
constant  toil,  method,  patience,  such  are  the  instruments 
with  which  the  sublime  edifice  is  reared.  The  world  goes 
on  and  the  success  of  to-day  should  not  be  the  sole  content- 
ment of  to-morrow:  a  reason  for  continual  effort.  And  why 
should  we  not  be  all  heart  and  mind  and  spirit  in  this  grand, 
glorious  movement  ?  Csesar  took  800  towns  and  the  world 
was  dazzled,  but  what  if  I  unfetter  a  captive,  if  I  redeem, 
save  one  immortal  soul  ?  .  .  The  divine  eloquence  of  the 
Eagle  of  Meaux,  the  songs  of  the  Swan  of  the  Meander  bring 
less  joy  to  a  mother's  ear  than  does  that  sweet  name  on  the 
heretofore  sealed  lips  of  the  child  of  her  bosom.  Let  you 
be  heartened.     Venus  gave  Galatse  life  at  the  instances  of 


THE    DEAF    AND    DUMB.  13 

Pygmalion.  Our  work  is  arduous,  but  the  recompense  shall 
not  be  beneath  Him  who  dispenses  rewards  in  the  eternal 
mansions. 

.  As  sorrows  bring  friends,  together,  so  often  do  joys.  At 
this  particular  time  we  know  not  of  a  land  that  has  greater 
reason  to  entertain  thoughts  of  thankfulness  and  tenderest 
pleasure  than  this  broad  Amercian  soil  and  its  host  of  noble 
schools.  Geographicall)-,  we  may  be  two  peoples.  In  aim 
and  heart,  we  are  one,  whilst  in  proud  results  we  fain  stand 
peerless!

The  Mackay  Institution  for  Protes- 
tant   Deaf- Mutes  and   the 
Blind, 


MONTREAL,  CANADA, 
1870-1893. 


By   HARRIET   E.  ASHCROFT, 

Superintendent  of  the  Institution. 


THE    MACKAY    INSTITUTION     FOE    PEOTESTANT 
DEAF-MUTES  AND  THE  BLIND. 

In  the  year  1868,  Mr.  J.  Barrett  McGann,  the  principal  of 
the  Upper  Canada  Institution  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb,  and 
pioneer  of  deaf-mute  education  in  the  Upper  Provinces,  was 
apphed  to  for  admission  to  his  school  of  a  deaf  girl  from  the 
Lower  Province. 

This  was  followed  by  other  applications  which  Mr.  McGann 
could  not  entertain,  and  later  on,  in  his  correspondence  with 
one  or  two  of  the  prominent  citizens  of  Montreal,  he  expressed 
hi^  wilUngness  to  bring  some  of  his  pupils  to  that  city  and 
give  a  pubUc  exhibition  of  what  could  be  done  to  ameliorate 
the  condition  of  the  deaf.  Arrangements  for  a  meeting  were 
accordingly  made,  and  with  such  success  that  a  generous 
amount  was  subscribed  by  some  of  the  gentlemen  present,  and 
the  matter  of  establishing  a  school  for  the  Protestant  deaf  of 
the  Lower  Province  was  taken  into  consideration,  and  Mr.  Mc- 
Gann was  invited  to  give  another  public  examination  of  his 
pupils  the  following  evening. 

A  few  months  later  another  public  meeting  was  called,  and 
the  following  citizens  formed  themselves  into  a  committee  to 
establish  an  Educational  Institution  for  the  Protestant  Deaf 
of  the  Province  of  Quebec  :  Mesdames  Andrew  Allan,  P.  Eed- 
path,  J.  W.  Dawson,  Major,  Bond,  Cramp,  Fleet,  Brydges, 
Moffatt,  Brown,  and  Workman  ;  Messrs.  Charles  Alexander, 
President ;  Thomas  Cramp,  Vice-President ;  Fred  Mackenzie, 
Hon.  Secretary-Treasurer  ;  Thomas  Workman,  John  Dougall 
(proprietor  Montreal  Witness),  William  Lunn,  G.  Moffatt,  J. 
A.  Mathewson,  J.  H.  E.  Molson,  Hon.  J.  J.  C.  Abbott,  E. 
Carter,  Q.  C,  P.  D.  Browne,  W.  H.  Benyon,  J.  F.  Barnard,  J. 
Leeming,  and  S.  J.  Lyman. 

It  was  resolved  to  ask  for  legislative  aid  and  to  appeal  for 
public  subscriptions.  Mr.  Thomas  Cramp  collected  $5,950, 
and  Mr.  Fred.  Mackenzie  sent  out  hundreds  of  circulars  to 
ministers  in  all  parts  of  the  Province  to  obtain  the  name,  age, 
sex,  circumstances,  etc.,  of  all  Protestant  deaf-mutes  whom 
they  might  know  of.  Still  another  public  meeting  was  held, 
when  it  was  decided,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  late  Eev. 


4  The  Mackay  Institution. 

Collins  Stone,  of  Hartford,  who  was  present  by  invitation  of 
the  board,  to  make  a  trial  with  a  small  school  under  the  man- 
agement of  Mr.  Thomas  Widd,  himself  a  deaf-mute  of  excep- 
tional intelligence. 

Mr.  Widd's  wife  was  appointed  matron.  A  small  red-brick 
house  with  ample  grounds  just  outside  the  city  limits  was 
secured  at  a  rental  of  $4.00  per  annum,  and  a  grant  of  |1,000 
having  been  received  from  the  government,  on  the  15th  of 
September,  1870,  the  school  was  ready  to  receive  pupils. 

On  November  1,  1870,  the  Institution  was  formally  opened 


THOMAS  WIDD. 


by  the  Protestant  Bishop  of  Montreal  and  Metropolitan  of 
Canada. 

During  its  first  session  sixteen  pupils  were  admitted — 
thirteen  boys  and  three  girls.  The  system  of  instruction  pur- 
sued was  simUar  to  that  of  all  British  schools — natural  signs, 
writing,  and  the  double-hand  alphabet. 

Mr.  Widd  gave  the  first  public  examination  of  his  pupils  on 
June  13,  1871,  and  in  the  same  month  a  meeting  of  the  board 
of  management  was  called,  when  it  was  decided  that  in  order 
to  increase  the  funds,  which  were  Tery  low,  Mr.  Widd,  with 
some  of  his  pupils,  should  make  a  tour  of  the  Province,  ac- 


The  Mackay  Institution.  5 

companied  by  Mr.  Fred.  Mackenzie  (who  was  ever  ready  to 
lend  a  helping  hand),  and,  by  holding  examinations  and  solicit- 
ing subscriptions,  advertise  the  school,  as  well  as  increase  its 
funds. 

On  the  20th  of  January,  1873,  the  Governor-General  of 
Canada,  Lord  Dufferin,  accompanied  by  Lady  Dufferin,  visited 
the  school  and  conversed  with  the  pupils. 

In  1875  Mr.  C.  J.  Brydges  collected  f  2,061,  and  in  1876  the 
government  grant  was  raised  to  $1,729. 

Notwithstanding  these  additions  to  the  income,  the  great 


JOSEPH   MACKAY. 


financial  depression  of  1876  affected  the  Institution  in  such  a 
measure  that  it  became  deeply  in  debt.  At  this  critical  junc- 
ture the  late  Mr.  Joseph  Mackay  purchased  a  suitable  site  and 
presented  it,  with  the  handsome  and  appropriate  building 
now  widely  known  as  the  Mackay  Institution,  for  the  abode 
and  education  of  deaf-mutes  of  this  Province. 

We  quote  the  following  from  the  Montreal  Daily  Witness, 
November  30,  1876 : 

The  sixth  annual  meeting  yesterday  of  this  useful  and  benevolent  In- 
stitution, whieh  is  situated  in  Cote  St.   Antoine,  was  one  of  the  most 


6  The  Mackay  Institution. 

interesting  and  most  important  ever  held,  and  was  marked  by  an  event 
which  is  regarded  as  the  commencement  of  an  era  in  its  history. 

The  Institution  had  long  felt  the  need  of  more  extensive  accommoda- 
tion, the  limited  capacity  of  the  building  having  compelled  the  turning 
away  of  many  applicants  who  had  desired  admission  to  its  hospitality 
and  advantages,  and  such  a  necessity  has  been  very  much  to  be  regretted, 
considering  the  fact  that  the  principal,  Mr.  Thomas  Widd,  and  his  ex- 
cellent co-laborer,  Mrs.  Widd,  have  devoted  themselves  exclusively  and 
with  whole  hearts  to  the  work  of,  so  far  as  possible,  relieving  the  mis- 
fortune of  the  deaf-mutes,  and  that  a  considerable  number  have  alreadv 
gone  out  from  under  their  efficient  training  prepared  to  earn  for  them- 
selves a  living  and  even  to  cope  with  their  more  favored  fellow-men  for 
success  in  life.  The  event  referred  to  was  no  less  than  the  receipt  from 
Joseph  Mackay,  Esq.,  an  old  friend  of  the  Institute,  of  the  donation  of 
a  lot  of  land,  and  plans  for  a  magnificent  new  building  which  he  proposes 
erecting  thereon  at  his  own  expense. 

The  meeting,  which  was  held  in  the  school-room  of  the  Institution, 
was  largely  attended.  Among  those  present  were  noticed  Chas.  Alexan- 
der (President,  in  the  chair),  Andrew  Allan,  F.  Wolferstan  Thomas,  Hugh 
McLennan,  Fred.  Mackenzie  (Secretary-Treasurer),  Esqs.,  Mr.  Duff,  Dr. 
Scott,  and  a  large  number  of  ladies. 

After  the  meeting  had  been  duly  opened,  the  chairman  made  the  fol- 
lowing remarks  t 

""We  meet  you  to-day,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  with  much  pleasure.  It  is 
now  several  years  since  our  work  of  instructing  Protestant  deaf-mutes 
began  here,  and,  though  working  amid  many  discouragements,  our  work 
has  proved  so  useful  that  its  results  more  than  compensate  the  managers 
for  all  their  anxieties  and  efforts  in  connection  with  it.  Now,  while  we 
have  been  trying  to  make  both  ends  meet,  in  the  time  of  our  anxiety 
God  raises  up  a  friend  to  help  us  in  the  very  way  we  wished — that  is,  to 
extend  our  efforts  by  means  of  a  larger  building — and  has  put  it  into  the 
heart  of  an  old  and  respected  fellow-citizen,  Joseph  Mackay,  Esq.,  to 
give  us  a  splendid  piece  of  ground  in  Cote  St.  Luke,  and  to  erect  thereon, 
at  his  own  expense,  a  stone  building  capable  of  accommodating  fifty 
students  and  their  teachers.  How  thankful  we  feel  for  this  generous 
gift  was  expressed  at  a  meeting  of  the  managers  a  few  days  ago." 

He  then  read  the  following  letter  : 

Sheeekooke  Steeet,  Monteeal, 

yovember  2t,  1876. 
Ohaeles  Alexandee,  Esq., 

President  Protestant  Institute  for  Deaf-Mutes. 
My  Deae  Sie  :  I  have  always  had  a  warm  sympathy  for  the  deaf-mutes, 
and  have  observed  carefully  the  efforts  to  improve  their  condition.  See- 
ing that  they  do  not  come  under  our  School  Board,  and  that  the  present 
accommodation  is  altogether  too  limited,  I  decided  on  procurinc  a  lot  of 
ground  in  a  healthy  situation  (Cote  St.  Antoine),  on  which  I  propose  to 
erect  a  building  capable  of  accommodating  about  fifty  pupils  with  their 
teachers,  and,  when  completed,  to  donate  it  to  trustees  for  the  use  of  the 
Protestant  deaf-mutes  of  our  Province,  trusting  that  it  may  receive  a 
liberal  support  from  our  charitable  public,  and  that  a  large  number  of 


The  Mackay  Institution.  7 

this  afflicted  class  may  receive  in  it  education  fitting  them  to  gain  inde- 
pendent livelihoods. 

The  grounds  measure  300  x  241  feet.  Accompanying  this  note  is  a 
sketch  of  the  proposed  building,  which  please  place  before  Mr.  Widd, 
principal,  and  your  committee,  from  whom  I  shall  be  very  happy  to  re- 
ceive any  suggestions  relative  to  plans. 

Yours,  very  sincerely, 

JOSEPH  MACKAY. 

Moved  by  Mr.  F.  "Wolferstan  Thomas,  Seconded  by  Mr.  Hugh  McLen- 
nan— 

That  the  warmest  thanks  of  this  meeting  are  due,  and  are  hereby  ten- 
dered, to  Joseph  Mackay  for  his  magnificent  gifts  to  the  Protestant  deaf- 
mutes  of  the  Province  of  Quebec. 

.  The  board  of  management  also  resolved  to  change  the  name 
of  the  Institution  to  the  Mackaj'  Institution  for  Protestant 
Deaf-Mutes. 

The  corner-stone  of  this  magnificent  gift  was  laid  on  the  6th 
of  June,  1877,  in  the  presence  of  a  large  number  of  ladies  and 
gentlemen. 

Mr.  Mackay  addressed  the  assembly  as  follows  : 

Mr.  Chairman,  Labies,  and  Gentlemen  :  The  Institution  for  which 
this  building  is  being  erected  has  had,  as  yet,  a  brief  career  of  useful- 
ness. Among  its  founders  and  friends  may  be  numbered  leading  citizens 
of  Montreal,  besides  other  ladies  and  gentlemen,  and  I  think  special  men- 
tion should  be  made,  in  this  connection,  of  our  worthy  chairman,  Mr. 
Charles  Alexander ;  our  secretary-treasurer,  Mr.  F.  Mackenzie;  Mr.  Thos. 
Cramp,  Mr.  Andrew  Allan,  Mr.  Dougall,  senior,  who  is  always  doing  good 
wherever  he  goes  ;  Mr.  "Widd,  the  principal  of  the  school,  as  well  as  the 
governors  and  managers,  who  have  done  good  work.  The  work  of  the 
school  was  commenced  in  1870,  with  sixteen  pupils ;  the  largest  number 
yet  in  attendance  was  twenty-five,  during  the  session  of  1874  and  1875. 
The  total  number  connected  with  the  school  from  its  formation  is  forty- 
one.  Some  of  these  have  continued  through  several  sessions,  and  others 
have  remained  for  only  a  few  months.  Of  the  twenty-two  in  attendance 
last  session,  seven  have  paid  full  fees,  five  partial  fees,  and  ten  were  free 
pupils.  Of  the  education  given,  it  may  be  sufficient  for  me  to  say  that 
it  is  under  the  able  and  judicious  direction  of  the  principal  and  his  as- 
sistants, and  embraces  intellectual  and  spiritual  culture,  as  well  as  instruc- 
tion in  several  of  the  useful  arts  of  life.  The  pupils  are  prepared,  when 
they  remain  a  sufficient  time  in  the  Institution,  to  make  their  way  in  this 
world,  and  have  their  minds  and  hearts  turned  to  the  higher  realities  of 
the  world  to  come.  What  a  blessing  to  the  afaicted !  And  thus  the 
founders  and  supporters  are  made  a  blessing  as  stewards  of  God's  bounty. 
The  government  of  our  Province  has  given  a  small  annual  grant  in  aid  of 
this  Institution,  but  its  support  has  been  chiefly  drawn  from  private 
benevolence.  Feeling  deeply  the  importance  and  value  of  the  work  done, 
and  wishing  to  promote  its  success  and  extension,  I  resolved  some  time 


8  The  Mackay  Institution. 

ago,  as  announced  in  a  letter  addressed  to  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  on  the 
24th  of  November  last,  to  erect  this  building,  and  to  place  it  and  the 
grounds  attached  to  it  in  the  hands  of  trustees,  to  be  used  by  them  and 
their  successors  for  the  education  of  the  Protestant  deaf  and  dumb  of 
this  Proviuoe.  Several  conversations  with  Mr.  Widd,  who  spoke  of  the 
immediate  necessity  of  larger  buildings  and  the  difficulties  in  obtaining 
funds,  led  to  this  decision,  specially  when,  on  mentioning  it  to  a  relative, 
the  reply  was,  "  Why  not  do  it  yourself  ?" 

I  only  add  that  I  trust  and  pray  this  building  may  be  completed  with- 
out any  accident  or  untoward  incident,  and  be  carried  to  a  speedy  and 
successful  completion  ;  and  for  years  and  generations  to  come  the  Insti- 
tution may,  through  the  Divine  favor,  prove  a  source  of  manifold  blessing 
to  the  afflicted  class  whose  good  it  seeks,  and  may  never  lack  generous, 
warm-hearted  friends,  and  wise  and  godly  instructors  to  carry  on  the 
work. 

The  Institution  is  erected  on  one  of  the  most  picturesque 
sites  in  Montreal,  commanding  a  view  of  the  St.  Lawrence  and 
Mount  Royal.  It  is  intended  to  accommodate  seventy-five 
pupils.  The  style  of  the  buUding  is  gothic  and  it  is  buUt  of 
gray  stone,  is  three  stories  in  height,  with  a  basement  and 
mansard  roof  ornamented.  It  is  heated  by  two  hot-water 
boilers,  with  coils  in  all  the  rooms.  The  work  was  designed 
and  carried  out  under  the  superintendence  of  John  James 
Browne,  a  Montreal  architect. 

The  opening  of  the  Mackay  Institution  by  Lord  and  Lady 
Dufferin  took  place  February  12,  1878. 

In  front  of  the  Institution  two  evergreen  arches  were  con- 
structed. An  immense  number  of  Montreal's  leading  citizens 
were  present,  amongst  whom  were  the  Lieutenant-Governor  of 
Quebec,  His  Lordship  the  Metropolitan  of  Canada,  Dean 
Bond,  Dr.  Dawson,  Principal  of  McGill  University,  Lieut-Gen- 
eral Smyth,  U.  S.  Oonsul-General  Dart,  C.  J.  Brydges,  Chas. 
Alexander,  Alderman  Clendenning,  T.  Cramp,  F.  Wolferstan 
Thomas,  F.  Mackenzie,  Capt.  Smyth,  Joseph  Mackay,  Edward 
Mackay,  Rev.  Dr.  De  Sola,  Colonel  Dyde,  and  most  of  the 
city  clergymen.  Precisely  at  a  quarter  past  3  o'clock  the  royal 
salute  by  Bugle  Major  Clapham  of  the  cavalrj'  announced 
the  approach  of  the  party.  Their  Excellencies  were  es- 
corted into  the  hall  and  conducted  to  their  seats  by  Mr. 
Charles  Alexander,  the  president  of  the  Institute,  the  vast  as- 
sembly rising.  , 

Rev.  Mr.  Mackay,  of  Cote  Street  Church,  read  the  parable 
of  Christ  healing  the  dumb  from  St.  Mark,  and  also  the  29th 
chapter  of  1st  Chronicles,  from  the  10th  to  the  22d  verse.     His 


The  Mackay  Institution.  9 

Lordship  the  Metropolitan  of  Canada  (Bishop  Oxenden)  then 
offered  up  a  prayer. 

Mr.  Joseph  Mackay  said: 

May  it  please  your  Excellencies,  Mr.  President,  ladies  and  gentlemen : 

It  is  exceedingly  gratifying  and  encouraging  to  the  friends  of  the  In- 
stitution that  your  Excellencies  have  become  its  patrons,  and  that  the 
Governor-General  and  the  Countess  of  Dufferin  are  present  to-day  to  in- 
augurate its  opening,  thus  following  the  example  of  Her  Most  Gracious 
Majesty  the  Queen,  who  is  ever  ready  to  promote  the  good  of  her  sub- 
jects and  the  relief  of  the  distressed.  I  am  pleased  to  see  here  to-day  so 
many  of  the  friends  of  the  afflicted  persons  for  whom  this  building  is 
provided.  I  congratulate  the  founders  and  constant  supporters — many 
of  whom  I  see  here  present — on  the  good  work  they  have  accomplished. 
And  now,  good  friends,  one  and  all,  in  providing  additional  accommoda- 
tion, I  throw  on  you  additional  responsibility  and  afford  you  greater 
scope  for  future  usefulness.  But  let  me  say  I  feel  that  you  have  only  to 
hint  at  what  is  needed  in  order  to  induce  others  to  give  freely,  as  "  stew- 
ards of  God,"  appointed  to  support  this  Institution.  We,  in  the  enjoy- 
ment of  all  our  faculties,  are  hardly  able  to  realize  the  deprivation  and 
isolation  of  the  deaf  and  dumb — by  whom  we  are  surrounded — cut  off, 
as  they  are,  from  the  tones  of  home. 

Mr.  Mackay  went  on  to  say  that  in  some  homes  three  and 
four  afflicted  ones  were  to  be  found,  and  that  this  should  call 
forth  the  sympathy  of  every  one.  They  all  hoped  to  see  their 
Institution  grow  in  strength  in  the  years  to  come. 

He  praised  the  governors  and  managers  for  the  success  that 
had  attended  their  efforts.  He  believed  that  many  present  at 
this  opening  did  not  know  the  great  work  that  was  being  done. 
From  this  time  forth  let  each  one  say,  "  I  will  contribute  my 
mite  also,"  and  the  reward  would  come  from  God  :  "  Inasmuch 
as  ye  have  done  it  unto  one  of  the  least  of  these  my  brethren, 
ye  have  done  it  unto  me."     He  continued  : 

In  sincere  thankfulness  to  God  that  I  have  been  instrumental  in  allevi- 
ating the  suffering  of  my  countrymen,  I  pray  for  life  in  the  future  to  see 
God  bless  the  work,  that  when  we  of  this  generation  are  called  away 
there  may  be  many  kind  friends  ready  to  fill  oar  place  and  carry  on  His 
work.     "  Then  to  God  alone  be  all  the  praise." 

Having  again  praised  the  managers  and  called  upon  the  citi- 
zens to  help  them  in  their  work,  he  concluded: 

I  have  the  honor  to  present  to  your  Excellencies  the  deed  of  this 
building  for  the  perpetual  use  of  Protestant  deaf-mutes  of  the  Province 
of  Quebec.  God  bless  the  Queen,  and  her  worthy  representative  now 
amongst  us. 

Mr.  Charles  Alexander  then  stepped  forward,  and,  after  a 
few  prefatory  remarks,  read  the  following  address : 


10  The  Mackay  lutstltution. 

To  His  Excellency  The  Eight  Honorable  Sir  Frederick  Temple  Hamilton 
Blackwood,  Earl  of  Dufferin,  Viscount   and   Baron   Claudeboye,   of 
Claudeboye,  in   the   County   Down,  in   the   Peerage  of  the   United 
Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and  Ireland,  Baron  Dufferin  and  Claude- 
boye, of  Ballyleidy  and  Killeleagh,  in  the  County  Down,  in  the  Peer- 
age of  Ireland,  and  a  Baronet,  K.  P.,  K.  0.  B.,  Governor-General, 
etc.,  etc. 
May  it  please   your   Excellency,  the   governors   and   managers  of  the 
Mackay  Institution   for  Protestant  Deaf-Mutes  beg  to  express  to  your 
Excellency  their  grateful  appreciation  of  the  honor  you  have  conferred 
upon  the  Institution  by  consenting  to  be  present  od  the  occasion  of  the 
opening  of  the  building  in  which  they  have,  by  the  munificence  of  a  lib- 
eral citizen  of  Montreal,  been  permitted  to  welcome  your  Excellency. 

This  Institution  was  founded,  several  years  ago,  to  educate  and  care  for 
that  unhappy  class  of  persons,  in  the  Province  of  Quebec,  who  are,  un- 
fortunately, deaf  and  dumb.  It  has  been  productive  of  much  benefit  to 
that  class  of  persons  referred  to,  and  has  been  enabled  to  supply  annu- 
ally about  30  pupils  with  comfortable  quarters  and  the  means  of  acquir- 
ing education. 

By  the  liberality  of  Joseph  Mackay,  Esq.,  the  present  building  has 
been  given,  with  the  ground  upon  which  it  stands,  for  the  future  use  of 
the  Institution,  and  the  governors  and  managers  will,  by  this  munificent 
gift,  be  enabled  largely  to  extend  the  benefits  of  the  Institution,  as  it 
can  now  accommodate  at  least  100  pupils. 

The  Institution  at  present  has  no  permanent  endowment,  and  is  sup- 
ported, in  addition  to  a  small  grant  from  the  Province  of  Quebec,  by 
voluntary  contributions.  The  governors  and  managers  have  no  doubt 
that  the  well-known  liberality  of  the  citizens  of  Montreal  will  continue 
to  support  this  Institution,  and  enable  it  adequately  to  fulfil  the  enlarged 
sphere  of  usefulness  which  is  now  open  to  it. 

The  governors  and  managers  have  great  pleasure  in  thanking  your 
Excellency  most  heartily  and  warmly  for  this  visit,  and  to  assure  your 
Excellency  that  not  only  will  your  presence  to-day  be  most  gratifying  to 
the  large  number  who  take  a  deep  interest  in  the  good  which  this  Insti- 
tution is  enabled  to  afford,  but  that  it  will  shed  a  ray  of  light  upon  the 
darkened  paths  of  those  pupils  who  to-day  are  witnesses  of  your  Excel- 
lency's gracious  sympathy  with  them,  and  be  an  abiding  record  for  all 
future  time  of  the  kind  and  generous  feelings  which  have  guided  the 
representative  of  their  beloved  Queen  in  extending  a  sympathizing  ex- 
pression to  those  whom  it  has  pleased  the  Almighty  to  aflBict. 

The  govei'nors  and  managers  beg  also  to  be  permitted  to  express  their 
Tieartfelt  thanks  for  the  great  kindness  which  has  led  Her  Excellency  the 
Countess  of  Dufferin  to  be  also  present  in  this  visit  of  sympathy  and  mercy 
to  the  aiHicted,  and  the  governors  and  managers  earnestly  pray  that  your 
Excellencies  may  be  long  spared  to  perform  similar  high  duties  to  those 
which  have  devolved  upon  your  Excellencies  during  your  residence  in 
Canada,  and  will  ever  be  borne  in  deep  and  grateful  remembrance  by 
the  people  of  this  country. 

Signed  on  behalf  of  the  Mackay  Institution  for  Protestant  Deaf- 
Mutes. 

MoNTKEAL,  February  12,  1878. 


The  Mackay  Institution.  ]  1 

An  address  on  behalf  of  the  pupils  was  read  ;  then  a  pretty 
little  girl  named  Jessie  Macfarlane,  one  of  the  pupils,  presented 
a  bouquet  of  beautiful  flowers  to  Lady  Dufferin,  who  smiled 
graciously  when  receiving  them. 

His  Excellency  replied  : 

Ladies  and  Gentlemen  :  I  can  assure  you  it  gives  me  very  great  pleas- 
ure to  have  been  permitted  to  take  part  in  the  celebration  of  this  day. 
Never  do  I  feel  more  at  home  amongst  you,  never  do  I  feel  greater  pleas- 
ure in  doing  my  official  duties,  never  do  I  feel  that  I  am  more  fitly  rep- 
resenting Her  most  gracious  Majesty  than  when  by  my  presence  I  testify 
my  sympathy  with  those  who,  like  the  managers  of  this  Institution  and 
like  their  friends,  and  especially  like  Mr.  Mackay,  are  trying  to  relieve 
the  distressed  and  lessen  calamities  like  those  of  the  persons  on  whose 
behalf  we  are  assembled  together  this  day.  Some  years  ago  I  had  the 
pleasure  of  visiting  this  establishment,  but  it  was  then  in  a  different  con- 
dition, being  in  a  small  house,  capable  of  containing  only  a  few  people. 
Now  I  find  myself  nnder  the  roof  of  a  palace.  It  was  then  the  grain  of 
mustard  seed  ;  it  has  since  become  a  great  tree,  under  the  protection  of 
whose  branches  its  inmates  dwell.  I  am  sure  it  must  be  a  gratification 
for  Mr.  Mackay  to  know  that  his  efforts  are  appreciated.  The  presence 
of  such  an  audience  is  proof  of  this.  Most  heartily  do  I  wish  success  to- 
all  your  endeavors,  and  most  warmly  do  I  congratulate  you  upon  such  a. 
measure  of  success. 

In  conclusion,  His  Excellency  declared  the  building  open 
for  the  purpose  for  which  it  was  erected. 

In  1878,  at  the  eighth  annual  general  meeting,  Mr.  Charles 
Alexander  resigned  his  position  as  president  of  the  board  of 
management ;  thereupon  the  following  resolution  was  carried 
unanimously : 

That  the  board  of  managers  cannot  allow  Mr.  Charles  Alexander  to- 
retire  from  the  office  of  president  of  this  Institution,  with  which  he  has 
been  connected  since  its  foundation,  without  expressing  their  high  appre- 
ciation of  the  valuable  services  which  he  has  rendered  for  so  many  years, 
and  they  regret  that  he  has  felt  compelled  to  relinquish  an  office  which 
he  had  filled  in  so  satisfactory  a  manner. 

The  board  further  took  this  opportunity  of  correcting  a  prev- 
alent impression  that  the  Institution  had  an  endowment  fund, 
as  it  had  none  whatever,  and  rather  more  than  half  of  its  an- 
nual expenses  had  to  be  provided  by  voluntary  subscriptions. 
There  was  a  deficit  at  the  end  of  the  year  of  $790.72.  The 
outstanding  accounts  were  also  considerable,  and  the  board 
urged  their  Protestant  fellow-citizens  to  come  to  their  aid  in 
the  interests  of  that  class  of  afflicted  persons  who  were  their 
special  charge. 


12  The  Mackay  Institv.tion. 

Shortly  after  this,  Mr.  F.  Wolferstan  Thomas  collected  a 
sum  sufficient  to  erect  ample  workshops  of  gray  stone,  and  also 
a  gallery  leading  from  the  main  building  to  the  shops.  A  print  - 
ing  office  and  cabinet  shop  were  properly  equipped,  where  the 
boys  were  instructed  in  these  trades  during  the  hours  they 
were  not  in  school. 

In  1880,  His  Excellency  the  Governor-General  and  Princess 
Louise  consented  to  become  patrons  of  the  Institution.  His 
Excellency  shortly  afterwards  visited  the  Institution.  About 
this  time,  Mr.  Frederick  Mackenzie,  who  had  labored  so  long 
and  earnestly  to  forward  the  interests  of  the  Institution,  re- 
signed his  position  as  honorary  secretary-treasurer ;  also  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  C.  J.  Brydges  resigned  their  offices  on  the  board  of 
management. 

Resolutions  of  regret  at  losing  such  good  friends  were  passed 
at  the  tenth  meeting. 

In  June,  1881,  Mr.  Joseph  Mackay  passed  to  his  rest,  and  at 
the  annual  meeting  of  the  board  the  managers  expressed  them- 
selves as  follows : 

It  is  their  sad  duty,  before  entering  on  the  usual  review  of  their  opera- 
tions for  the  past  year,  to  record  their  A-ery  deep  regret  at  the  irreparable 
loss  which  they  have  sustained  by  the  death  of  their  late  president,  Mr. 
Joseph  Mackay.  His  wise  counsel  and  zealous  co-operation  were  of  ines- 
timable value  to  the  Institution,  which  he  may  have  been  said  to  have 
founded,  and  of  which  he  was  so  munificent  a  benefactor. 

Mr.  Mackay  left  a  legacy  of  $2,000  to  the  Institution. 

Mr.  Edward  Mackay,  brother  of  the  late  Joseph  Mackay,  was 
elected  to  the  president's  chair,  which  office  he  worthily  filled 
until  the  year  1882,  when  he,  too,  passed  away. 

Mr.  Edward  Mackay  took  a  warm  interest  in  the  Institution, 
and  at  his  death  left  it  a  legacy  of  $8,000. 

Mr.  Hugh  Mackay  was  now  elected  to  fill  the  president's 
chair,  lately  occupied  by  his  uncle,  but  in  a  few  years  he  suc- 
cumbed, to  consumption.  On  his  death,  April,  1890,  he  be- 
queathed $12,000  to  the  Institution. 

Mr.  P.  Wolferstan  Thomas,  who  for  many  years  had  taken 
an  active  part  in  the  affairs  of  the  Institution,  now  became  its 
president.  The  day  of  his  election  to  this  office  proved  a  red- 
letter  day  for  the  Institution  and  its  inmates.  Nothing  could 
exceed  this  gentleman's  zeal  and  capacity,  and  from  that  day 
the  Institution  took  a  bound  forward,  and  has  ever  since 
claimed  its  right  to  be  considered  not  only  equal  to  any  school 
in  Canada,  but  second  to  none  in  the  world.

A  new  impetus  was  given  to  teachers  by  increasing  their 
salaries  and  adding  to  the  staff.  Much  more  prominence  was 
given  to  articulation,  and  the  comforts  of  the  children  were 
materially  increased. 

In  September,  1881,  Miss  H.  B.  McGann,  an  experienced 
teacher  of  the  deaf,  had  been  appointed  lady  superintendent 
and  special  teacher  of  articulation,  a  position  which  she  filled 
until  Mr.  Widd  resigned  the  office  of  principal  in  1882,  on  ac- 
count of  ill  health,  and  then  Miss  McGann  accepted  the  posi- 
tion offered  her  of  superintendent.

Mr.  Widd  had  been  connected  with  the  Institution  since  its 
inception,  and  the  best  years  of  his  life  had  been  spent  in 
helping  to  build  up  the  Mackay  Institution.  The  managers 
expressed  their  regret  at  his  withdrawal. 

In  this  year  the  Protestant  blind  of  this  Province  were  ad- 
mitted to  the  school,  and  seven  took  advantage  of  the  privilege 
of  receiving  an  education  where  their  own  religion  only  was 
taught ;  also  the  Institution  became  free  of  debt. 

In  April,  1889,  Miss  McGann  resigned  her  position  of  super- 
intendent to  be  married  to  Mr.  J.  Imrie  Ashcroft,  who  had  es- 
tablished a  school  for  the  deaf  in  Victoria,  B.  C.     By  subse-

quent  arrangements  of  the  board  of  management  Mr.  Ashcroft 
■was  induced  to  return  to  the  Mackay  Institution,  where  he  had 
been  head-teacher  for  many  years,  and  he  and  Miss  McGann 
were  united  in  marriage  in  June,  1889.  Together  they  man- 
aged the  internal  affairs  of  the  Institution  as  joint  superin- 
tendents until  November,  1891,  when  Mr.  Ashcroft  died  of  con- 
sumption. 

At  the  general  annual  meeting  the  following  resolution  of 
condolence  was  passed ; 

Moved  by  Mr.  E.  Mackay,  seconded  by  Mrs.  J.  W,  Mackedie — 
That  this  meeting  desires  to  place  on  record  their  deep  regret  at  the 
death  of  the  associate  superintendent,  Mr.  J.  Imrie  Ashcroft,  the  loss  of

whose  much  valued  services  will  be  greatly  felt  by  the  managers,  staff, 
and  pupils.  Mr.  Ashcrof  t's  abilities  as  a  teacher  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  and 
the  blind,  the  interest  he  took  in  their  welfare  and  advancement  during  the 
many  years  he  was  connected  with  the  Institute,  together  with  his  high 
sense  of  the  duties  and  responsibilities  connected  with  this  branch  of 
education,  make  his  loss  a  void  that  will  be  difficult  (ofiU;  and  they 
would  also  express  to  his  widow  their  heartfelt  sympathy  with  her  in 
this  her  heavy  bereavement ;  and  that  the  secretary  be  instructed  to 
send  a  copy  of  this  resolution  to  Mrs.  Ashcroft  and  the  press.

Mrs.  Ashcroft  again  assumed  all  the  responsibilities  at- 
tendant on  the  position  of  superintendent,  but  these  have 
been  greatly  lightened  by  the  managers,  especially  the  lady 
directresses,  Mesdames  F.  Wolferstan  Thomas,  P.  S.  Steven- 
son, and  Robert  Mackay,  who  are  always  ready  to  help  Mrs. 
Ashcroft  in  every  emergency,  and  sustain  her  in  all  difiiculties. 

The  system  of  instruction  at  the  Mackay  Institution  is  simi- 
lar to  that  used  in  all  prominent  institutions  of  the  United 
States  and  Canada.  The  one-hand  alphabet  is  used  exclusively, 
and  signs  are  used  as  little  as  possible.  The  pupils  who  learn 
to  articulate  are  encouraged  to  use  their  speech  as  much  as 
possible,  and  the  teachers  associate  freely  with  the  children, 
thereby  making  them  more  intellectual  and  brighter  than  if 
left  too  much  to  themselves.  Earnest  endeavors  have  been 
made  by  the  superintendent  to  make  this  entirely  an  articula- 
tion school,  but  the  advanced  age  at  which  many  of  these  jju- 
pils  enter  school  renders  this  almost  an  impossibility. 

The  trades  taught  are  printing,  cabinet-making,  chair-caning, 
and  dress-making.

and    Dumb, 


FREDERICTON,  NEW   BRUNSWICK, 
1882-1893. 


By   albert   F.  WOODBRIDGE, 

Principal  of  the  Institution. 


THE  FEEDEEICTON  INSTITUTION    FOR   THE  EDU- 
CATION OF  THE  DEAF  AND  DUMB. 

The  Fredericton  Institution  for  the  Education  of  the  Deaf 
and  Dumb  was  founded  by  its  present  princijpal  and  opened 
on  the  1st  of  September,  1882,  to  meet  an  imperative  need, 
and  to  supply,  as  far  as  possible,  an  ever-growing  want  in  the 
educational  requirements  of  this  Province. 


ALBERT    F.    WOODBRIDGE, 


The  following,  among  other  considerations,  led  to  its  estab- 
lishment : 

Statistics. 

In  1871  the  population  of  New  Brunswick  was  285,594,  and 
its  deaf  and  dumb  population  306.  In  1881  its  general  popu- 
lation was  321,000,  and  calculating  one  deaf-mute  for  933  of 
its  population,  which  obtained  in  1871,  its  deaf-mute  popula- 
tion at  this  time  was  344.    The  Province  within  this  decade 


4  The  Fredericton  Institution. 

added  35,000  to  her  population  and  37  to  the  number  of  the 
deaf-mutes. 

As  New  Brunswick  is  increasing  her  population  year  by 
year,  it  follows,  as  a  natural  sequence,  that  the  number  of  her 
deaf-mutes  is  increasing  in  the  same  jDroportion.  Increased 
provision,  then,  became  necessary  to  overtake  the  education  of 
these  "  children  of  silence,"  unless  New  Brunswick  was  will- 
ing to  leave  the  responsibility  of  their  education  to  a  neigh- 
boring Province,  where  but  few  could  obtain  the  privilege, 
owing  to  the  disinclination  of  parents  to  send  their  little  ones 
300  miles  away  to  school.  That  she  was  not  indifferent  to 
their  welfare  was  evidenced  by  the  encouragement  met  with 
in  the  various  sections  of  the  Province  where  the  question 
was  ventilated. 

The  establishing  of  a  home  school  for  the  deaf-mutes  of 
New  Brunswick  was  felt  and  acknowledged  in  all  quarters  to 
be  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  and  one  which  should  be  sup- 
ported by  all  who  took  an  interest  in  their  welfare. 

A  tangible  proof  of  this  encouragement  lay  in  the  collections 
made  in  various  portions  of  the  Province  for  this  purpose  ;  in 
the  promises  made  by  numerous  friends  of  the  movement  to 
seek  out  the  deaf-mute  children  of  their  respective  localities 
and  get  them  forwarded  to  Fredericton  for  education,  and  in 
the  number  of  children  who  were  waiting  to  take  advantage  of 
its  opening. 

Opening  of  the  Institution. 

On  deciding  on  its  establishment  various  difficulties  pre- 
sented themselves  for  consideration — finding  a  suitable  site 
and  building  for  our  purpose  not  being  the  least  of  these.  At 
last,  after  much  search,  both  these  conditions  were  amply  met 
in  locating  the  Institution  at  the  residence  of  Senator  Bots- 
ford,  at  Hawthorn  Hill. 

In  accordance  with  the  announcement  of  our  intention  made 
two  months  previously,  the  Institution  was  opened  for  the 
reception  of  pupils  on  the  1st  of  September,  1882.  Six  pupUs 
immediately  presented  themselves  for  admission,  which  num- 
ber was  afterwards  increased  to  eighteen. 

It  was  a  great  satisfaction  to  us  to  have  met  with  a  location 
so  beautiful  and  so  admirably  adapted  in  every  particular  to 
our  wants  and  purposes.  No  finer  site  could  be  found  in  the 
Maritime  Provinces.     The  ample  facilities  which  it  afforded 


The  Fndericton  Institution.  5 

for  fresh-air  exercise  were  most  conducive  to  the  health  and 
happiness  of  our  pupils.  The  building  was  exceedingly  con- 
Tenient,  and  all  who  paid  us  the  honor  of  a  visit  testified  to  the 
arrangements  made  for  the  children's  comfort.  The  pupils 
themselves  fully  appreciated  its  advantages,  and  their  noisy 
shouts  when  at  play  indicated  thorough  enjoyment. 

Several  well-known  gentlemen  of  the  city  kindly  consented 
to  act  as  directors.  An  appeal  was  issued  for  funds  and  we 
quietly  settled  down  to  work. 

Institution  Destroyed  by  Fiee. 

Our  prospects  appeared  exceedingly  bright,  but  after  a  few 
months  of  steady  endeavor  to  increase  the  usefulness  of  the 
Institution  and  to  bind  friends  to  its  interests  we  met  with  a 
serious  and  unexpected  discouragement  in  the  loss  of  the  Insti- 
tution by  fire. 

This  occurred  on  March  25,  1883,  and  necessitated  our  re- 
moval to  a  residence  called  "  Uplands,"  a  few  minutes'  walk 
from  Hawthorn  Hill,  and  which  was  fortunately  unoccupied 
at  the  time.  The  fire  occurred  at  8  o'clock  in  the  evening,  and 
started  at  the  barn,  which  adjoined  the  main  building.  It  was 
discovered  in  time  to  get  the  children  out  safely,  and  also  the 
furniture.  What  was  lost  was  taken  away  during  the  confusion 
incident  to  such  a  calamity.  The  building  was  totally  de- 
stroyed, but  during  the  progress  of  the  fire  friends  kindly 
removed  the  chUdren  to  places  of  safety.  In  this  connection 
our  sincere  acknowledgments  were  due  to  those  friends  who 
so  kindly  came  forward  and  rendered  valuable  assistance  dur- 
ing this  trying  ordeal. 

We  were  glad  to  be  enabled  to  reopen  school  at  "  Uplands  " 
the  following  week. 

Government  Grant. 

The  parents  of  our  pupils  have  always  been  willing  to  pay 
what  they  could  towards  the  board  expenses  of  their  children ; 
but  most  of  them  being  in  poor  circumstances,  they  have  not 
been  able  to  do  much  more  than  provide  clothing  for  them. 
We  have  relied  principally  on  Government  aid  and  voluntary 
contributions  to  sustam  the  work.  Steps  were  taken  by  the 
managing  committee  to  lay  the  claims  of  the  Institution  before 
the  Government,  and  an  annual  grant  of  $1,500  was  voted  for 
this  purpose. 


The  Fredericton  Institution. 


Purchase  of  Site. 

As  Senator  Botsford  offered  the  estate  at  Hawthorn  Hill,  the 
site  of  the  late  Institution,  consisting  of  117  acres,  for  the  very 
reasonable  sum  of  $1,000,  it  was  decided  to  devote  $500  of  the 
amount  granted  by  the  Government  for  two  years  to  secure 
this  eligible  site.  This  was  done,  and  the  estate  became  vested 
in  the  hands  of  Sir  John  Allen  and  two  other  members  of  our 
committee.  It  was  our  earnest  desire  to  erect  a  suitable  build- 
ing the  moment  funds  became  available  for  the  work. 

After  several  years  of  steady  endeavor,  marked  by  shadow  as 
well  as  sunshine,  a  feeling  in  favor  of  securing  greater  advan- 
tages for  the  deaf-mutes  of  this  Province  sprang  up  among 
our  public  men  and  friends  of  the  Institution.  Our  local  gov- 
ernment was  again  appealed  to  during  the  session  of  1888,  and 
the  cause  brought  prominently  before  them,  the  following  be- 
ing a  few  of  the  arguments  advanced  on  that  occasion  to  induce 
more  favorable  legislation  for  this  portion  of  humanity : 

The  claim  which  the  deaf  and  dumb  have  upon  their  native  place  for 
what  intellectual  advantages  it  affords  should  be  recognized  as  equally 
imperative  with  that  of  hearing  and  speaking  children.  No  doubt  exists 
as  to  the  wisdom  of  making  ample  proyision  for  supplying  every  one  of 
these  with  a  good  education,  but  the  deaf  and  dumb  are  left,  to  a  large 
extent,  dependent  on  the  charity  of  the  benevolent.  While  the  sub- 
scribers have  given  our  collectors  a  very  kind  reception,  and  have  ex- 
pressed their  satisfaction  at  the  results  which  have  been  attained  by  the 
Institution  during  the  past  year,  it  is  felt  that  to  place  the  Institution  on 
the  best  footing  and  to  give  it  a  favorable  opportunity  of  reaching  all 
the  deaf-mute  children  of  the  Province  would  be  to  make  it  a  govern- 
ment Institution,  its  e.xpenditure  to  be  defrayed  by  government  funds, 
thus  falling  upon  the  whole  Province  equally  ;  or  that  each  county  be 
called  upon  to  defray  the  expense  of  providing  an  education  for  these 
children  in  proportion  to  the  number  which  it  sends  for  instruction. 

The  adoption  of  some  such  plan  would  be  of  incalculable  benefit  to 
the  deaf-mute  population  of  New  Brunswick.  The  largest  and  most 
flourishing  institution  in  Canada — that  at  Belleville,  Ontario — is  supported 
in  this  way.  Nearly  all  the  institutions  in  the  States  are  supported  by 
the  legislature  as  a  matter  of  course,  and  the  wisdom  of  this  system  is 
evidenced  by  the  fact  that  upwards  of  twenty  thousand  children  have 
been  trained  and  educated  since  the  first  institution  was  opened  at  Hart- 
ford in  1817.  It  is  but  rational  to  conclude  that  hundreds  of  these  have 
become  good  and  respectable  citizens,  responsible  householders,  workers 
in  various  handicrafts,  payers  of  taxes,  and  supporters  of  the  State  in 
which  they  live. 

There  is  no  reason  why  New  Brunswick  should  not  take  up  the  matter 
in  earnest,  provide   a   building  capable  of  accommodating  fifty  or  sixty

children,  endow  it  that  it  may  be  properly  equipped,  take  measures  to 
induce  or  compel  the  attendance  of  children,  and  the  work,  receiving  this 
impetus,  will  be  carried  on  with  hope  and  vigor.  The  result  cannot  but 
be  a  blessing  to  the  silent  inhabitants  of  our  Province,  who  are  living  in 
a  state  of  bondage  and  isolation,  until  their  fetters  are  broken  by  the 
light  of  knowledge  and  the  power  which  knowledge  gives  of  holding 
communication  with  the  world  around  them. 

Their  condition  is  anything  but  enviable,  even  when  crowned  with  all 
the  advantages  which  education  bestows.  They  are  heavily  burdened  to 
the  close  of  life.  How  much  heavier  this  burden  becomes  as  years  ad- 
vance, and  no  helping  hand  is  stretched  forth  to  lighten  it !  Try  to 
imagine  its  weight.  None  of  the  thousand  and  one  delightful  sounds 
which  so  sensibly  affect  ourselves  can  ever  be  heard  by  them.  No  loving 
accents,  no  words  of  kindly  cheer,  no  expressions  of  sympathy  from  those 
who  are  near  and  dear,  ever  reach  their  ears.  Nature's  joyous  strains 
are  unrealized,  unappreciated,  and  unknown.  They  can  join  in  no  hymns 
of  praise,  and  for  them  the  glad  tidings  of  salvation  are  preached  in 
vain.  The  barrier  cannot  be  removed.  No  institution  can  replace  their 
loss.  Education  cannot  restore  the  precious  gift ;  yet  how  great  is  its 
power  to  alleviate  and  soften  their  deprivation !  No  amount  of  teaching 
can  give  back  the  value  of  this  lost  faculty  ;  but  to  reach  their  minds, 
although  by  another  avenue  ;  to  enable  them  to  discriminate  between 
right  and  wrong  ;  to  give  them  the  means  of  communication  with  their 
fellows  ;  to  open  the  language  of  books  and  periodicals ;  to  give  them 
an  understanding  of  the  Word  of  Life,  and  to  lead  them  to  an  intelligent 
appreciation  of  Christ's  great  sacrifice  and  the  way  of  salvation,  is  what 
it  can  do,  has  done,  and  is  doing  at  the  present  moment  to  thousands  of 
these  children  in  various  educational  centres  throughout  the  world. 

To  the  credit  of  our  Provincial  legislators,  our  pleading  was 
not  in  vain,  and  a  bill  was  passed  at  this  session  fully  recog- 
nizing the  claim  that  the  deaf-mutes  of  the  Province  were  en- 
titled to  equal  privileges,  as  regards  education,  with  hearing 
and  speaking  children,  and  provision  was  made  by  the  passing 
of  this  act  for  the  erection  of  a  building  capable  of  accommo- 
dating fifty  or  sixtjr  pupils. 

The  sum  of  $1,000  a  year  was  granted  for  the  term  of  twelve 
years  to  erect  a  suitable  building  of  brick  and  stone. 

I  made  drawings  of  a  building  which  I  thought  would  com- 
bine a  pleasing  and  attractive  exterior  with  convenience.  It 
was  desired  to  have  a  building  which  would  be  in  keeping 
with  the  location  designed  for  it — one  that  would  be,  to  a  cer- 
tain extent,  an  ornament  to  the  southern  portion  of  the  city, 
and  yet  have  its  space  so  arranged  as  to  give  the  greatest 
facilities  for  the  educational  work  we  had  in  view.  These 
drawings  were  submitted,  in  the  first  place,  to  the  committee, 
and   afterwards   to  the   Hon.  Attorney-General,  and  on  their

approval  Mr.  Clarke  was  authorized  to  draw  up  the  plans  and 
make  specifications  for  the  work.  Tenders  were  advertised 
for,  and  Mr.  Joshua  Limerick,  of  Fredericton,  was  entrusted 
with  the  erection  of  the  building  for  the  sum  of  ten  thousand 
iour  hundred  dollars. 

OuE  New  Building. 

Of)erations  were  commenced  in  the  spring  of  1889,  and  the 
main  building  completed  in  March,  1891.  Barns  and  other 
outside  buildings  were  erected  at  an  additional  cost  of  about 
four  thousand  dollars.  The  estate  on  which  the  Institution  is 
built  is  near  Salamanca,  about  a  mile  from  the  Cathedral,  and 
Tisitors  coming  up  the  river  from  St.  Johns  and  points  east 
obtain  a  good  view  of  the  building  previous  to  landing  at  the 
wharves  of  the  city. 

The  site,  which  was  also  the  site  of  the  first  Institution,  was 
purchased  after  the  destruction  of  that  building  by  fire  in 
March,  1883,  and  is  acknowledged  to  be  one  of  the  most 
b)eautiful  and  commanding  in  the  Lower  Provinces. 

The  ground  gradually  rises  from  the  gate-house  near  Sala- 
manca, and  a  carriage-drive  winds  through  a  fine  avenue 
•of  tall  spruce  and  fir  trees,  and  after  crossing  a  little  brook 
spanned  by  a  light  wooden  bridge  the  first  view  of  the  new 
building  is  obtained. 

The  drive  passes  on  in  front  of  the  building  and  joins  the 
main  road,  which  skirts  the  base  of  the  hill. 

On  reaching  the  terrace,  and  standing  near  the  site  of  the 
old  fountain,  an  extensive  and  magnificent  view  of  the  river, 
with  the  lands  beyond  dotted  with  farm-houses,  meets  the 
«ye.  To  the  left,  in  the  distance,  Mr.  Alexr.  Gibson's  cotton- 
mill  and  the  beautiful  church  at  Marysville  are  plainly  visible, 
and  its  white  sjjire  glistening  in  the  sunlight  affords  a  pleas- 
ing contrast  to  the  dark  green  of  the  woods  beyond.  The 
steep  slojje  behind  and  in  front  of  the  building  ensures  us  good 
drainage,  and  the  clear  spring  of  water  which  rises  in  the 
woods  about  a  quarter  of  a  mile  away  from  the  back  of  the 
house  is  considered  one  of  the  best  in  the  neighborhood,  and 
has  never  been  known  to  fail. 

"While  the  grounds  have  become  a  veritable  wilderness  dur- 
ing the  past  few  years  by  the  overgrowth  of  evergreens  and 
the  decay  and  destruction  of  the  fences  and  bridges,  the 
splendid  growth  of  beeches,  maples,  yellow  bii'ch,  and  other

ornamental  trees  can  be  advantageously  retained,  and  will  add 
considerably  to  the  beauty  of  the  place,  the  possibilities  of 
which,  where  nature  has  been  so  lavish,  being  apparent  even 
to  a  casual  observer. 


THE    FHEDERICTON   INSTITUTION   FOB  THE   EDUCATION   OF    THE  DEAF  AND   DUMB. 

The  building  is  56  feet  by  65  feet,  of  brick,  with  stone  base- 
ment, coignes,  and  facings,  three  stories  high,  with  mansard 
roof,  surmounted  by  an  octagon  cupola  in  the  centre.  The 
front  entrance  has  an  ascent  of  nine  long  stone  steps,  on  the  plat- 
form of  which  four  circular  grooved  pillars  are  erected  to  form 
a  portico,  surmounted  by  an  iron  balustrade,  and  suitable  to 
the  character  of  the  building. 

The  interior  is  finished  throughout  in  a  good  and  workman- 
like manner.  On  entering  the  building,  the  main  hall,  36  feet 
by  12  feet,  faces  you,  from  which  a  handsome  staircase,  with 
newel  pillars  and  rail  of  stained  walnut,  and  stained  ash  banisters,, 
leads  to  the  second  and  third  stories.  On  the  right  of  this 
hall  are  the  reception-room,  library,  and  principal's  dining- 
room.  On  the  left  are  the  drawing-room,  lady  teachers'  sitting- 
room,  and  girls'  sitting-room. 

At  right  angles  to  the  main  hall  is  a  second  haU,  seven  feet 
wide,  with  an  entrance  from  a  portico,  with  two  large  pillars, 
situated  on  the  south  side  of  the  building  and  reached  by  an 
ascent  of  five  stone  steps. 

On  the  left  of  this  hall  is  a  fine  room  32  feet  by  17  feet  6 
inches,  which  is  used  as  a  school-room.     At  the  end  of  this- 


'10  The  Fredericton  Institution. 

hall  is  a  bath-room,  the  walls  of  which  are  sheathed  four  feet  in 
stained  ash,  and  the  doors  and  windows  in  light  mahogany. 
To  the  right  is  the  gentlemen  teachers'  sitting-room.  On  the 
left  of  this  hall  is  a  third  hall,  3  feet  6  inches  wide,  which  gives 
egress  to  the  play-ground  for  the  boys,  whose  sittiag-room 
opens  into  it. 

Prom  the  second  hall,  a  staircase  leads  into  the  basement,  65 
feet  by  56  feet,  which  contains  pupils'  dining-room,  33  feet  by 
18  feet,  kitchen,  laundry,  pantry,  scullery,  dairy,  store-rooms, 
wood  and  coal  cellars,  etc. 

The  second  floor  contains  principal's  bed-rooms,  lady  teach- 
ers' bed-room,  large  and  small  girls'  dormitories,  hospital,  spare 
room,  and  bath-room. 

The  third  floor  contains  gentlemen  teachers'  bed-rooms,  large 
and  small  boys'  dormitories,  hospital,  lumber-room,  clothes- 
room,  etc. 

The  building  is  heated  by  open  fire-places  in  which  coal  is 
used,  and  hot-air  apparatus,  the  furnaces  being  located  in  the 
basement. 

From  the  cupola  a  magnificent  view  of  the  river  and  sur- 
rounding country  is  obtained. 

The  planning  of  its  arrangements  occupied  much  thought. 
Since  the  building  is  completed,  furnished,  and  equipped  with 
educational  appliances,  it  is  eminently  adapted  to  the  purpose 
which  its  promoters  had  in  view. 

The  general  exterior  of  the  building  is  pleasing  and  attrac- 
tive, and  from  its  elevated  position,  sheltered  as  it  is  by  trees 
on  the  north,  west,  and  south,  it  forms  a  striking  feature  in 
the  landscape  when  seen  from  either  the  road  or  the  river. 

Impkovements  Made  in  the  Grounds. 

A  substantial  barn,  44  feet  by  35  feet,  has  been  erected  100 
feet  to  the  left,  and  back  of  the  main  building,  with  shingled 
roof  and  sides,  divided  into  four  divisions  of  11  feet  by  35  feet 
for  barn  floor,  carriage-shed,  harness-room,  and  stables  for 
horses  and  cattle,  with  large  upper  floor  for  stormg  hay, 
oats,  etc. 

A  new  fowl-house,  28  feet  by  13  feet,  was  erected  at  the  back 
of  the  barn.  A  new  wood-shed,  27J  feet  by  17^  feet,  with  an 
upper  floor  to  store  farm  implements,  tools,  lumber,  etc. 

A  new  bridge  was  erected  across  the  brook  on  the  road  lead- 
ing into  the  avenue,  and  two  seats  placed  there  for  the  con- 
venience of  visitors. 


The  Fredricton  Institution.  11 

The  piece  of  ground,  about  half  an  acre  in  extent,  va.  front 
of  the  barn,  extending  to  the  brook  on  the  left  and  to  the  road 
which  leads  in  front  of  the  main  building,  has  been  laid  out  as 
a  fruit  and  kitchen  garden.  A  new  pine  picket-fence  was  built 
round  it,  the  land  ploughed,  graded,  and  manured,  and  a  large 
number  of  fruit  bushes  and  strawberry  plants  were  transferred 
to  it  from  the  farm. 

The  splendid  plot  of  ground,  of  about  an  acre  and  a  half, 
which  extends  from  the  brook  to  the  edge  of  the  woods  on  the 
north  side  of  the  fruit  garden,  has  been  allotted  to  the  boys 
for  a  cricket  and  base-ball  ground.  A  circular  swing,  see-saw, 
and  gymnastic  apparatus  have  also  been  erected  there  for 
them.  It  is  intended  to  clear  and  grade  a  plot  of  ground  on 
the  south  side  of  the  house  for  the  girls.  The  portion  of 
ground  formerly  intended  for  a  flower  garden  will  be  levelled 
in  the  centre  and  laid  with  turf  for  croquet,  etc.;  an  orna- 
mental fence  erected  round  it,  and  the.  flower-beds  arranged 
along  the  inside  of  the  fence. 

The  line  fence  on  the  north  side,  extending  from  the  gate- 
house to  the  well,  a  distance  of  half  a  mile,  was  repaired  and 
put  into  good  condition,  new  rails  being  used  for  most  of  it ; 
the  Hon.  Senator  Wark  undertook  one-half  and  we  completed 
the  other.  A  new,  substantial  cross  fence  was  also  erected, 
running  from  the  line  fence  at  the  well  right  across  to  the 
cemetery  line.  The  fence  in  front  of  the  building  between  the 
two  entrances  was  also  repaii'ed. 

The  gate-house  was  badly  out  of  repair ;  the  roof  leaked 
considerably  and  it  was  reshingled  ;  the  joists  and  posts  of  the 
kitchen  were  found  to  be  rotten;  fresh  joists  were  put  in,  a 
new  floor  laid,  and  the  south  wall  was  taken  out  and  a  new  one 
built.  The  rooms  on  the  first  floor  were  replastered,  and  the 
sitting-room  and  small  bed-room  repapered.  The  stone  wall 
in  front  of  the  house  was  rebuilt  and  a  new  verandah  erected 
the  whole  length  of  the  buUdiug ;  it  is  now  comfortable  and 
occupied  by  a  good  quiet  tenant. 

The  orchard  cottage,  on  the  crest  of  the  hill,  was  also  found 
to  be  ia  a  very  bad  state.  The  roof  leaked;  the  joists,  sills, 
plates,  and  corner  posts  were  found  to  be  rotten,  and  it  be- 
came dangerous  to  live  in.  Attempts  were  made  to  repair  it, 
but  it  was  impossible  to  make  a  good  job  of  it.  The  old 
buildiag,  which  had  been  in  existence  some  eighty  years,  was 
taken  down,  and  a  new  and  substantial  one  erected  on  an  im- 


]  2  The  Fredericton  Institution. 

proved  plan.  The  framework  is  good  ;  the  roof  and  sides 
have  been  shingled,  and  the  cottage  is  now  finished  and  very 
comfortable. 

The  bridge  spanning  the  brook  on  the  south  side  of  the 
house  was  found  to  be  in  a  shaky  and  unsafe  condition ;  it  was 
therefore  taken  down  and  a  new  one  erected  in  its  place. 

Hundreds  of  small  bushes  which  disfigured  the  grounds  in 
front  of  the  building  were  pulled  up  and  burnt.  It  is  intended 
that  walks  shall  be  made,  seats  erected,  and  ornamental  trees 
planted  where  they  will  add  to  the  beauty  of  the  grounds. 
Much  may  be  done  in  this  direction  to  aid  nature  and  give 
pleasure  to  every  one  visiting  the  Institution. 

The  long  avenue  leading  from  the  gate-house  to  the  build- 
ing required  a  good  deal  of  attention.  Several  of  the  tall 
spruce  trees  lining  the  lower  side  of  the  road  became  rotten 
and  were  blown  down.  These  dead  trees  and  limbs  were  re- 
moved, the  others  carefully  trimmed,  seats  placed  here  and 
there,  and  the  appearance  of  the  avenue  improved  as  far  as 
possible.  It  is  always  cool  and  affords  a  grateful  shade  even 
in  the  hottest  weather,  and  is  one  of  the  most  attractive  spots 
in  the  Institution  grounds.  This  is  one  of  the  most  beautiful 
places  in  the  whole  Province,  and  where  nature  has  done  so 
much  to  make  it  attractive  we  consider  that  money  is  wisely 
spent  in  banishing  disfigurements,  everything  that  offends  an 
artist's  eye,  etc.,  adding,  where  we  can,  to  the  subtle  and  reSn- 
ing  touch  of  nature's  handiwork. 

Our  Present  Position  and  Prospects. 

We  have  now  a  handsome  building,  well  arranged,  equipped, 
and  adapted  to  the  work  for  which  it  was  inaugurated.  This 
Institution  is  not  a  sanitarium  for  the  relief  of  deafness,  nor 
an  asylum  for  the  retreat  of  aged  and  infirm  deaf-mutes.  Its 
character  is  distinctively  and  exclusively  educational,  and  it  has 
been  established  to  secure  an  education  for  those  children 
whom  deafness  precludes  from  participating  in  the  advantages 
of  the  ordinary  schools,  which  are  so  liberally  provided  for  the 
training  of  hearing  and  speaking  children  throughout  the 
length  and  breadth  of  our  Province.  The  course  of  study 
comprises  the  common  branches,  taught  by  trained  teachers  by 
methods  which  for  years  have  been  successfully  used  in  similar 
schools  in  the  old  country  and  on  this  continent. 


The  Fredericton  Inistitution.  13 

The  sign-language,  which  is  the  natural  language  of  aU  deaf- 
mutes,  is  largely  used  as  a  means  of  instruction,  and  may  be 
discarded  afterwards.  The  deaf,  however,  cling  to  it  long  after 
their  education  is  completed  on  account  of  its  convenience,  it 
being  the  medium  by  which  thought  can  be  most  readily  inter- 
changed. It  is  invaluabl  e  as  a  stimulus  of  the  dormant  facul- 
ties, gives  free  and  unlimited  power  in  the  expression  of  ideas, 
and  is  such  a  ready  means  of  conveying  information,  of  joining 
in  social  intercourse  and  in  the  discussion  of  the  burning  ques- 
tions of  the  hour,  that  as  long  as  the  deaf  exist  it  will  remain 
a  substitute  for  vocal  speech  and  a  monument  to  its  inventor. 

In  conclusion,  the  history  of  this  Institution  so  far  has  been 
one  of  constantly  increasing  usefulness  and  prosperity.  Be- 
ginning in  a  small  way,  amid  considerable  difficulties,  it  has 
advanced  step  by  step,  gradually,  but  persistently,  growing 
year  by  year  in  favor  with  one  and  all,  till  its  circle  of 
friends  and  well-wishers  to-day  may  be  numbered  by  thou- 
sands. We  cannot  rest  satisfied,  however,  with  the  achieve- 
ments of  the  past  or  the  prosperity  of  the  present.  We  would 
stretch  forward  to  greater  conditions  of  usefulness.  While 
there  exist  deaf-mute  children  in  the  Province  uneducated,  un- 
cared  for,  and  grovelling  in  ignorance,  it  is  our  earnest  desire 
to  bring  them  within  the  sheltering  walls  of  the  Institution, 
and  unless  we  strain  every  nerve  to  reach  these  children  the 
feeling  remains  that  our  duty  is  but  partially  accomplished. 
With  the  material  support  and  sympathy  of  our  legislature 
and  our  ever-increasing  circle  of  friends,  and  strengthened  by 
the  knowledge  that  we  have  made  some  headway  since  the  in- 
ception of  the  work,  we  can  look  forward  to  the  future  with 
confidence,  believing  that  our  aims  have  the  sanction  and  bless- 
ing of  Him  "  who  made  both  the  deaf  to  hear  and  the  dumb 
to  speak."

MANITOBA  INSTITUTION 

For  the  Education  of  the  Deaf  and  Dumb, 
WINNIPEG,  MANITOBA,  CANADA. 


The  Manitoba  Institution  for  the  education  of  the  Deaf  and 
Dumb  at  Winnipeg  is  the  seventh  and  youngest  school  of  its  kind 
in  Canada,  and  with  the  exception  of  one  it  is  the  smallest  in 
point  of  attendance. 

In  the  year  1888  a  class  was  organized  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Ministerial  Association  of  \Vinnipeg  with  Mr.  J.  C.  Watson  as 
principal  and  teacher,  and  in  the  early  part  of  1889  an 
appropriation  was  made  by  the  I^egislative  Assembly  of  Manitoba 
upon  the  recommendation  of  the  Government  of  twenty-five 
thousand  dollars  for  the  erection  of  a  suitable  building  and  for  the 
maintenance  of  the  school  for  one  year.  At  the  same  time  the 
institution  was  taken  under  the  control  of  the  Government  and 
Mr.  Watson  was  confirmed  in  his  appointment  as  principal. 

The  various  steps  taken  by  the  Ministerial  Association  to 
lead  up  to  this  condition  are  herewith  recorded  by  the  Rev. 
Hugh  Pedley,  pastor  of  the  Central  Congregational  Church) 
Winnipeg,  who  was  at  that  time  the  secretary  of  the  Ministerial 
Association,and  by  this  fact  more  closely  identified  with  the  work 
than  the  other  city  pastors.  It  might  be  suggested  that  had  Mr. 
Pedley  not  been  the  secretary  at  the  time,  the  interest  manifested 
by  the  association  would  not  have  been  so  active.  : — 

"In  the  year  1888  very  largely  through  the  instrumentality  of  Mr- 
F.  H.  Francis,  of  Headingly,  Prof.  J.  C.  Watson,  a  gentleman  who 
had  been  engaged  in  work  among  deafmutes,  was  induced  to 
visit  ^Vinnipeg  with  a  view  of  starting  an  institution  for  the  training 
of  the  deaf  and  dumb.  Some  vague  assurance  of  support  had 
been  given  by  members  of  the  Government,but  when  Prof.  Watson 
arrived  nothing  definite  had  been  done,  and  he,  after  con- 
sultation with  Mr.  Francis,  brought  the  matter  before  the  Minis- 
terial Association  of   the  city    at  a  meeting  on  October  nth   1888.

2  Manitoba  Institution  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb. 

A  committee  consisting  of  the  Revs.  Jos.  Hogg,  J.  Dyke,  A.  F. 
Baird  and  Hugh  Pedley  was  appointed  to  co-operate  with  Mr. 
Watson  in  bringing  the  matter  before  the  pubhc  with  a  view  to 
making  a  beginning  as  soon  as  possible.  Acting  under  the  advice 
of  this  committee.  Prof  Watson  engaged  a  room  in  the  Fortune 
Block,  and  the  ministers  became  responsible  for  the  furnishings, 
heating  and  rent  until  the  Government  should  take  action.  Under 
such  conditions  as  these,  the  work  was  started  and  quite  a  number 
of  pupils  gathered.  The  next  step  faken  by  the  association  was 
on  January  7th,  1889,  when  arrangements  were  made  for  a  deputa- 
tion to  wait  upon  the  Government,  and  the  secretary  was  instructed 
to  invite  the  following  gentlemen  to  join  with  the  association  in 
forming  the  deputation  :  Fathers  Cherrier  and  Ouellette,  Bishop 
Machray,  Rev  A.  E.  Cowley,  Ven.  Archdeacon  Fortin,  Canon 
Pentreath,  Rev.  J.  J.  Roy,  Archbishop  Tache,  Mayor  Ryan,  Messrs. 
C.  J.  Brydges  and  Francis  and  the  editors  of  the  city  papers. 
A  week  or  two  after  the  deputation  met  at  the  City  Hall  and  went 
in  a  body  to  wait  upon  the  Government.  They  were  courteously 
received  by  Mr.  Greenway  and  his  cabinet  and  were  given  reason 
to  expect  that  the  work  would  betaken  up  by  the  Government  and 
placed  on  a  satisfactory  and  permanent  basis." 

As  the  foregoing  account  deals  more  particularly  with  the  efforts 
put  forth  by  the  Ministerial  Association  in  organizing  a  school  and 
does  not  refer  to  the  important  part  taken  by  members  of  the 
Local  Legislature  in  seconding  their  attempts  to  obtain  recognition 
from  the  Government,  the  history  of  the  pioneer  work  will  be  more 
complete  by  making  the  following  extract  from  the  last  annual 
report  of  the  principal  touching  upon  this  subject  : — 

"During  the  session  of  the  Legislature  in  188S  the  membdr  for 
Cartier,  Mr.  Gelley,  inquired  whether  the  Government  intended 
taking  any  action  towards  providing  for  the  educating  of  the 
deaf  and  dumb  children  in  the  Province,  and  was  informed 
by  the  Premier,  Hon.  Mr.  Greenwav,  that  they  were  desirous  of 
moving  in  that  direction.  A  step  further  was  taken  the  same  day 
by  Mr.  F.  H.  Francis,  member  for  St.  Francois  Xavier,  a  gentle- 
man who  for  years  has  taken  an  interest  in  the  education  of  the 
deaf  and  dumb,  arising  from  frequently  studying  the  working 
and  beneficial  results  of  the  system  in  force  in  a  school  for  this 
class  of  unfortunate  children  at  Margate,  Kent.  He  had  an  inter- 
view with  the  Premier,  and  expressed  the  hope  the  Government 
would  see  its  way  to  speedy  action,  pointed  out  that  in  one  parish 


Manitoba  Institution  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb.  3 

alone,  Headingly,  there  were  five  deafmutes  of  school  age,  ven- 
tured the  opinion  that  they  were  more  numerous  in  Manitoba 
than  was  generally  supposed,  and  offered  to  set  the  question  at 
rest  by  ascertaining  their  numbers.  With  the  consent  of  the 
(iovernment  Mr.  Francis  sent  circulars  to  the  secretary-treasurer 
of  each  school  district  soliciting  information,  and  returns  were 
received  showing  that  there  between  thirty  and  forty  of  that  class. 

Mr.  J.  C.  Watson,  of  Washington  Territory,  came  out  here  about 
this  time,  and  was  introduced  to  the  (rovernment  and  many  of  the 
citizens  of  Winnipeg  by  Mr.  Francis.  Soon  the  interest  in  the 
movement  to  establish  a  school  for  the  deaf  became  general,  meet- 
ings were  held  and  some  of  ttie  clergy  and  the  citizens  co-operated 
heartily  in  the  project.  A  plan  was  formulated  under  which  it  was 
agreed  that  each  of  the  city  churches  represented  should  bear  the 
expenses  of  the  proposed  school,  provided  the  salary  of  the  teacher 
was  paid  by  the  Government.  While  the  Government  approved 
of  the  plan,  they  were  unable  to  make  any  grant  on  the  grounds 
that  there  were  no  fundsforthe  purpose.  The  projectors  determined 
not  to  abandon  their  object,  resolved  that  the  school  (which  had 
already  been  started)  should  be  maintained,  and  they  maintained 
it,  Mr.  Francis  paying  the  salary  of  the  teacher.  In  the  beginning 
of  1889  deputations  of  the  clergy  and  laity  again  urged  the  matter 
on  the  Government  with  such  earnestness  that  the  Ministers  saw 
their  way  towards  asking  a  grant  from  the  House.  Then  the 
success  of  the  project  became  assured,  the  Government  took  over 
the  institution  and  found  quarters  for  it  in  the  public  buildings 
until  our  present  structure  on  Portage  Avenue  was  ready  for 
occupation." 

With  the  funds  appropriated  by  the  Legislature  of  1889,  twenty- 
five  thousand  dollars,  a  site  was  purchased  and  work  was  commenc 
ed  on  the  bui'ding  early  in  the  spring  and  carried  forward  until  the 
cold  weather  set  in,  the  severity  of  which  making  it  impossible  t(i 
fully  complete  the  work  during  that  year.  In  May,  1B90,  it  was 
ready  for  occupancy  and  the  whole  school  was  moved  into  the  new 
but  ding  from  its   temporary  quarters   in  the  Land  Titles  Offices. 

At  the  close  of  school  in  June  there  were  eighteen  pupils  in 
attendance  and  one  teacher,  that  duty  being  performed  by  the 
principal. 

During  the  summer  vacation  Mr.  Watson  was  forced  to  resign 
on  account  of  ill  health.  It  was  a  matter  of  deep  regret  to  himself 
and  his  friends  that  he   was  not   permitted  to  carry  on  the  work

under  the  favorable  circumstances,  which  the  Institution  had  been 
placed  shortly  before  he  left.  His  labors  among  the  deaf  of  Manitoba 
commenced  without  definite  promise  that  the  Government  would 
assume  the  responsibilityof  providing  for  their  education.  During 
the  entire  time,  about  nine  months,  the  school  over  which  he  presid- 
ed and  taught,  was  in  a  very  precarious  condition  and  to  be  oblig- 
ed to  relinquish  his  post  at  a  time  when  his  highest  hopes  had  been 
reached,  it  is  not  strange  that  his  disappointment  was  great. 
Mr.  T).  ^V.  McDermid,  late  of  the  Iowa  Institution,  and  former  y  of 
the  Ontario  Institution  located  at  Belleville,  was  appointed  to  the 
vacancy  caused  by  Mr.  Watson's  resignation,  and  Mrs.  Mary 
E.  McDermid  was  added  to  the  staff  as  his  assistant. 
On  January  ist,  1891,  Mr.  J.  R.  Byrne  «as  appointed  supervisor 
of  the  boys  with  the  additional  duty  of  assistant  teacher,  and  one 
year  later,  Jan.  ist,  1892,  Miss  Augusta  Spaight  was  added  to  the 
teaching  staff.  The  school  as  now  organized  has  three  teach- 
ers exclusive  of  the  principal,  and  with  this  number  the 
work  of  the  class-room  is  being  carried  on  in  a  most  satisfactory 
manner. 

The  attendance  has  been  increasing  gradually  since  the  opening 
of  the  Institution  though  but  a  small  number  each  year,  and 
there  are  at  the  present  time  thirty-six  in  residence.  The  following 
statement  will  show  the  total  number  who  have  been  taught 
and  the  number  enrolled  eaeh  year  since  the  school  was  found- 
ed :—

Attendance  during  the  session  of  1888-89        ....  10  pupils 

Attendance  during  the  session  of  1889-90           ....  20  pupils

Enrolled  during  the  year  1891           ......  39  pupils 

Enrolled  during  the  year  1892       ......  40  pupils 

The  total  number  who  have  received  instruction  since  the  school 
was  established  is  forty-seven. 

From  various  sources  which  are  deemed  reliable  it  is  found  that 
there  are  about  sixty  or  seventy  deaf-iTiutes  of  school  age  in  the 
Province,  but  it  is  not  probable  that  all  of  this  number  will  enter 
the  school.       The  country  is  growing  rapidly  and  we  may  look  for 


Manitoba  histitiition  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb.  5 

an  increase  in  the  attendance  from  year  to  year  in  the  same  ratio 
that  the  school  has  grown  since  its  opening.  The  management  of  the 
Manitoba  Institution  differs  considerably  from  the  American  Insti- 
tutions. The  direction  of  the  school  is  placed  under  the  control  of  the 
Department  of  Public  Works,  and  the  minister  of  that  department 
is  responsible  for  its  conduct,  as  well  as  all  other  institutions 
depending  exclusively  upon  provincial  aid  for  their  support.  Under 
the  minister  is  an  inspector  whose  duty  it  is  to  inspect  and  practically 
direct,  with  the  approval  of  the  head  of  the  department  the  affairs 
of  the  school  in  a  manner  similar  to  a  board  of  trustees.  There  is 
much  to  be  said  in  favor  of  this  system.  While  the  strictest  econ- 
omy is  observed  with  due  regard  to  the  objects  of  public  institutions 
every  requirement  when  positively  needed  is  forthcoming  with- 
out any  unreasonable  delay.  The  minister  in  charge  is  a  member 
of  the  Government,  consisting  of  an  executive  council  of  five  men 
who  are  members  of  the  Legislature  and  who  shape  the 
greater  part  of  the  legislation  of  the  country  and  prepare  all 
estimates  for  the  support  of  public  institutions  and  the  civil 
government. 

There  are  at  the  present  time  thirty-six  pupi's  in  residence,  and 
these  are  divided  into  three  classes.  As  the  school  is  practically  in. 
its  infancy  there  is  no  class  farther  advanced  than  a  class  of  four, 
years'  standing,  and  the  work  consists  principally  of  language 
lessons,  supplemented  by  simple  exercises  in  History,  Geography 
and  Arithmetic.  A  small  class  of  five  pupils  is  organized  in  articu- 
lation and  is  given  daily  instruction  in  speech  and  lip-reading.- 
We  quote  from  the  American  Annals  of  the  Deaf  the  editor's  de- 
finition of  the  combined  System  of  Instruction  which  is  the  system- 
that  has  been  in  vogue  in  this  school  since  its  opening  :  "Speech, 
and  speech-reading  are  regarded  as  very  important,  but  mental 
developement  and  the  acquisition  of  language  are  regarded  as&gt; 
still  more  important.  It  is  believed  that  in  many  cases  mental 
development  and  the  acquisition  of  language  can  be  best  promot- 
ed by  the  Manual  Method,  and  so  far  as  circumstances  permit, 
such  method  is  chosen  for  each  pupil  as  seems  best  adapted  for 
his  individual  case  Speech  and  speech-reading  are  taught  where 
the  measure  of  success  seems  likely  to  justify  the  labor  ex- 
pended." There  are  altogether  in  Canada  and  the  United 
States  fifty-eight  schools  pursuing  the  combined  system  of 
instruction. 

The  trades  that  have  been  introduced  are  printing  and  plate-

engraving.  The'outfit  being  small,  there  are  only  a  comparatively 
small  number  of  pupils  receiving  a  manual  training.  It  is  the 
(intention,  however,  of  the  Government  to  establish  a  more  thorough 
system,  so  that,  at  least,  a  majority  of  the  boys  may  have  an  oppor- 
tunity of  learnmg  some  handicraft  that  will  be  of  practical  benefit 
when  they  leave  school. 

The  female  pupils  are  taught  plain  sewing  and  fancy  work,  and 
ithe  matron  has  organized  a  small  class  in  cooking.  While  no 
boast  is  made  of  the  progress  attained  in  the  manual  arts,  we  are 
reasonably  satisfied  with  what  is  being  done  in  this  direction, 
hoping,  however,  that  the  Government  may  recognize  more  fully 
ithe  importance  of  a  practical  education  for  our  deaf  children. 

The  only  serious  mishap  that  has  taken  place  was  the  fire  which 
took  place  October  27th,  1891.  On  that  morning  flames  were 
seen  issuing  from  the  attic  of  the  bui'ding,  and  before  the  fire  depart- 
ment succeeded  in  checking  the  fire  the  roof  and  upper  flat  of 
the  building  were  totally  consumed.  The  children  were  all  in 
school  at  the  time,  and  as  the  class-rooms  are  on  the  first  floor  they 
had  no  difficulty  in  escaping.  The  furniture  of  the  institution  was 
nearly  all  saved,  but  the  oflficers,  pupils  and  servants  lost  the  greater 
part  of  their  clothing.  The  damage  to  the  bui'ding  and  furniture 
was  fully  covered  by  the  insurance,  and  in  reinstating  the  insti- 
:tution  the  improvements  made  have  greatly  added  to  its  appear- 
ance and  convenience.  \Vhi'e  the  building  was  undergoing 
repairs,  the  school  was  carried  on  in  a  building  known  as  the 
Bannatyne  castle,  a  large  comfortable  and  convenient  house,  where 
the  work  of  the  school  was  not  interferred  with  to  any  great  extent. 

Since  printing  has  been  introduced  a  little  paper,  named  the 
Silent  Echo,  has  been  published  and  issued  monthly.  The 
principal  object  in  doing  this  has  been  to  afford  the  pupils  of  the 
school  a  means  of  making  practical  use  of  the  knowledge  they 
are  receiving  and  to  establish  an  active  factor  in  the  work  of  the 
class-room  furnishing  as  it  does  a  medium  for  the  expression  of 
thought  and  cultivating  a  taste  for  reading.  The  instruction  of 
plate-engraving  has  been  carried  on  since  the  introduction 
of  printing  a  year  ago.  It  has  been  found  that  this  industry  serves  a 
double  purpose,  in  that  it  leaches  a  useful  cal'ing  and  at  the  same 
time  the  pictures  turned  out  furnish  excellent  aids  in  the  teaching 
of  language  to  the  younger  children. 

In  connection  with  the  school  a  literary  association  has  been 
established,  known  as  the  Pharnorth  Literary  Debating  Society. 
Its  membership  comprises  all  educated  deaf-mutes  living  in  the  city, 
including  the  advanced  pupils  of  the  school.  The  outside  mem- 
bers take  an  active  part  in  all  the  exercises,and  several  of  them 
holdofiice.  The  object  of  the  association  is  to  furnish  intellectual 
and  social  entertainment  to  its  members.  The  ofificers  are  as  fol- 
lows :  Honorary  president,  D".  W.  McDermid  ;  president,  J.  R. 
Byrne  ;  vice-president,  Wm.  Liddy ;  secretary-treasurer,  A.  A.

The  Fottndation  ot'  the  School. 

Don  Benito  Juarez,  the  illustrious  patriot,  had  the  ineffable 
satisfaction  reserved  to  him,  as  it  were,  to  establish  in  a 
definite  manner  the  present  National  School  for  the  Deaf  and 
the  Dumb,  for  the  third  article  of  the  law  on  public  instruc-

tion,  dated  April  15,  1861,  issued  by  virtue  of  the  discretional 
powers  with  which  he  had  been  invested,  says : 

There  shall  be  established  henceforth,  at  the  capital  of  the  Eepublic, 
a  school  for  the  deaf  and  dumb,  which  shall  be  subject  to  the  special 
regulations  to  be  made  for  the  same ;  and  as  soon  as  circumstances  shall 
thereafter  permit,  other  schools,  intended  to  meet  the  same  purpose, 
shall  be  established  at  saoh  points  in  the  Bepublie  as  shall  be  deemed 
convenient,  the  same  to  be  paid  for  out  of  the  national  funds.

Unfortunately,  the  laudable  provisions  of  this  law  were  not 
complied  with  on  account  of  the  difficult  circumstances 
brought  upon  the  whole  country  by  the  French  intervention, 
the  governmental  authorities  having  been  compelled  to  with- 
draw a  short  time  after  to  Paso  del  Norte,  a  place  called  now 
Ciudad  Juarez — that  is  to  say,  Juarez  City. 

In  1865  a  French  professor,  Mr.  Edward  Huet,  deaf  and 
dumb  by  birth,  came  to  this  country  for  the  purpose  of  estab- 
lishing, at  this  capital,  a  school  for  the  deaf  and  dumb. 

The  energy  and  activity  that  characterized  him  were  dis- 
played to  the  greatest  extent  whenever  an  enterprise  calculated 


DON    FEKUERO,    SKCEETAKY. 


to  promote  the  interests  of  his  fellow-sufferers  was  started  ; 
and  encouraged  by  an  ardent  zeal  to  extend  to  Mexico  the 
benefits  he  had  before  spread  in  Brazil,  where,  at  Rio  Janeiro, 
he  had  established  the  Imperial  Institute  for  the  Deaf  and 
Dumb  with  the  aid  of  that  country's  government,  he  presented 
himself  to  the  philanthropist  Don  Jose  Antonio  Fonseca, 
whose  learning  and  patriotism  were  widely  known,  and  ex- 
plained to  him  his  object,  soliciting,  at  the  same  time,  his 
efficient    and    well-deserved    influence    in    obtaining   official 


The  National  School  of  Mexico.  5 

patronage,  indispensable  at  that  time  to  the  realization  of  his 
scheme. 

The  moral  feelings  of  Mr.  Fonseca  having  been  vividly- 
touched,  he  accepted  with  enthusiasm  the  scheme,  and  profit- 
ing by  his  intimate  friendship  with  Don  Ignaoio  Trigueros, 
then  the  president  of  the  common  council,  and  who  was  a  man 
of  learning  and  of  noble  feelings,  succeeded  in  inducing  this 
gentleman  to  favor  so  worthy  an  object,  and  to  such  an  extent 
as  to  overcome  each  and  every  difficulty  that  was  met  with,  as

well  as  to  authorize  the  establishment  of  the  School,  which  was 
located  in  a  small  department  of  the  bailding  formerly  occu- 
pied by  the  extinct  college  of  San  Gregorio,  in  which  place 
now  stands  the  Industrial  School. 

Constitutional  order  having  been  re-established  through- 
out the  country,  the  illustrious  Don  Benito  Juarez,  wishing  to 
forward  his  humanitarian  purposes,  issued  a  decree  on  No- 
vember 28,  1867,  nationalizing  the  said  school,  which  to  that 
date  had  been  under  the  control  of  the  municipality,  ordering, 
at  the  same  time,  the  said  establishment  to  be  moved  to  the 
building  it  now  occupies,  and  the  same  to  be  denominated 
"  Escuela  Normal  de  Profesores  y  Prof esoras  para  la  ensenanza 
de  sordo-mudos  " — that  is  to  say,  "  Professional  Normal  School 


C  The  National  School  of  Mexico. 

for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb."  Hence,  the  truth  of  the  assertion  that 
to  the  illustrious  Juarez  is  due  the  credit  of  having  founded 
this  charitable  institution. 

The  System  op  Teaching. 

The  system  then  followed  in  teaching  was  that  of  the  Abbe 
de  I'Epee,  the  basis  of  which  consists  in  natural  pantomime  or 
mimicry,  to  which  are  added  such  conventional  signs  or  signals 
as  will  give  said  language  a  grammatical  character,  rendering 
its  construction  easy  throughout  its  modifications.  By  this 
system  Don  Pablo  Velasco,  Don  Luis  Jimenez,  and  Don  Jose

Maria  Marquez  graduated,  and  the  respective  diplomas  of 
professorship  were  issued  to  them  by  the  Government. 

Mr.  Huet  died,  and  the  Supreme  Government  appointed 
Professor  Marquez  in  his  stead,  by  suggestion  of  the  presi- 
dent of  said  School,  Don  Eamon  I.  Alcaraz. 

In  1883,  at  the  initiation  of  the  president  of  the  establish- 
ment, the  Supreme  Government  commissioned  Mr.  Marquez 
to  go  to  Europe  for  the  purpose  of  studying  the  different  sys- 
tems employed  in  teaching  in  the  schools  for  the  deaf  and 
dumb,  and  he  was  there  honored  by  the  appointment  of  acting 
member  and  representative  of   Mexico  in   the  International 


The  National  School  of  Mexico.  7 

Congress  of  Instructors  of  the  Deaf  and  Dumb  held  in  Brus- 
sels, to  the  deliberations  of  which  he  contributed  his  share  by- 
defending  the  purely  oral  system,  which  was  approved  by  the 
said  Congress,  as  the  best  way  or  means  of  communication  to 
enable  the  deaf  and  dumb  to  make  themselves  understood  by 
persons  enjoying  the  use  of  all  their  senses. 

Confiding  in  the  knowledge  Professor  Marquez  had  acquired 
of  the  purely  oral  system  during  the  time  he  attended  the 
principal  schools  of   Prance,   Italy,  and  Spain,  on  his  return 


GIRLS'   CLASS-BOOM. 


the  said  system  was  adopted,  and,  in  1885,  the  foundation  was 
laid  for  a  thorough  trial  of  it  with  all  the  pupils  who,  on  ac- 
count of  their  age,  were  considered  available.  The  old  system 
was  continued  with  those  who,  having  already  acquired  a 
knowledge  of  the  dactylological  system,  did  not  lend  themselves 
to  the  exigencies  of  the  new  method,  either  on  account  of 
their  physiological  condition  or  owing  to  defects  resulting 
from  their  habit  of  pantomime. 

The  system,  consisting  in  actions  or  motions  that  may  be 
easily  repeated  or  imitated  through  the  simplicity  of  their 
form,  lacks  efficiency  when  it  comes  to  abstractions ;  and  even 
when  a  pupU  is  relatively  competent  in  the  employment  or

use  of  such  means,  he  is  often  compelled  to  recur  to  the  help 
of  an  interpreter  to  make  himself  understood  by  strangers. 

All  the  obstacles  of  pantomime  which  may  be  noticed,  even  in 
the  class-room,  and  which  are  still  more  perceptible  away 
from  school,  are  not  to  be  met  with  in  the  oral  method,  the 
only  one  which  requires  no  help  nor  auxiliaries  of  any  kind, 
and  enables  a  deaf-mute  to  express  his  ideas  solely  by  the 
word  and  to  understand  others  by  reading  the  movement 
of  the  lips. 


BOYS*  CI^ASS-ROOM. 


The  method  employed  for  tuition  in  accordance  with  the 
new  or  modern  system  requires,  as  indispensable  factors,  the 
education,  as  it  were,  of  the  sight,  which  may  be  said  to  sub- 
stitute the  ear,  and  plays  an  important  part  in  the  instruction  ; 
as  also  the  practice  and  sensibility  of  feeling,  which  is  a  valu- 
able aid  and  contributes  efficiently  to  perceive  the  articulated 
sound.  To  teach  the  pupil  how  to  breathe  that  he  may 
normalize  his  breath  ;  to  compel  and  educate  the  vibrations  of 
the  vocal  apparatus  which  for  some  length  of  time  may  have 
been  inactive,  and  to  place  him  in  given  physiological  condi- 
tions, are  the  principal  objects  of  the  professor,  and  constitute 
the  basis  of  the  method  employed  to  enable  the  deaf  and  dumb 
to  speak.

Laborious  and  long  is  this  system,  and  on  that  account  it 
requires,  in  teaching,  resignation,  constancy,  and  steadiness,  as 
it  is  through  these  means  that  the  jsrofessor  succeeds  in  at- 
taining in  a  satisfactory  manner  the  reward  for  the  pains  taken, 
and  which  consists  in  making  his  pupil  utter  such  words  as 
will  express  his  feelings. 

Course  of  Study. 

The  course  of  study  embraces  the  national  language,  arith- 
metic, objective  lessons,  elementary  geometry,  geography 
(very  particularly  that  of  Mexico),  book-keeping,  drawing,  and 
penmanship. 


CLASS-EOOM. 


In  the  same  School  the  pupils  may  become  tailors,  shoe- 
makers, and  lithographers,  for  which  purpose  shops  are  main- 
tained in  the  School,  where  the  boys  may  become  familiar  with 
each  of  these  branches. 

The  constitution,  generally  unhealthy,  of  the  pupils  makes 
it  necessary,  nay,  indispensable,  to  give  them  frequent  physical 
exercises,  such  as  gymnastics  and  horticultural  practice. 

Official  Control. 

The  School  had  been  under  the  control  of  the  Minister  of 
Justice  and  Public  Instruction  from  the  time  it  was  founded 


10 


The  National  School  of  Mexico. 


in  a  definite  manner  until  July  of  last  year,  when  it  was  placed 
under  the  control  of  the  Minister  of  the  Interior. 

Sundry  Inpobmation. 

The  number  of  pupils  receiving  tuition  at  the  School  is 
thirty-four,  of  whom  ten  are  girls  and  twenty-four  are  boys. 

Persons  employed  at  the  establishment  and  professors  are 
as  follows : 

1  president  of  the  School. 

1  secretary  and  treasurer. 

1  physician.

1  tailor  (master). 

1  shoemaker  (master). 

In  accordance  with  the  regulations  of  the  School,  only  boys 
below  nine  years  or  not  exceeding  twelve  are  admitted ;  they 
have  to  answer  to  an  interrogatory  relating  to  antecedents  of 
parents  and  to  any  illness  the  boy  or  girl  may  have  suffered 
with,  for  the  purpose  of  investigating  the  cause  which  may 
have  produced  the  organic  disease  or  defect. 

The  interrogatory  is  as  follows  :

in  order  to  pronounce  the  vowels  and  consonants? 

26.  Can  he  utter  any  sounds  ? 

These  questions  are  not  always  answered  satisfactorily, 
either  because  the  person  presenting  the  child  is  ignorant  of 
his  antecedents,  or  because  the  parents  fail  to  answer  clearly 
a  number  of  them  ;  however,  it  may  be  deducted  that  the  causes 
determining  the  disease  or  defect  of  being  deaf  and  dumb  are 
the  degree  of  consanguinity  and  the  unhealthiaess  of  the 
parents. 

Conclusion. 

Such  is  in  compendium  the  history  of  this  Institute,  where 
some  pupils  have  already  acquired  instruction  enough  to  make 
themselves  understood  with  others  in  society,  either  by  writ- 
ing or  speaking,  according  to  the  time  devoted  to  their  educa- 
tion. 

At  present  this  is  the  only  School  for  the  deaf  in  Mexico ; 
one  was  opened  at  Zacatecas  in  1882,  but  it  was  afterwards 
discontinued.

AMERICAN  SCHOOLS  FOE  THE  DEAF  WHICH  HAVE 
BEEN  DISCONTINUED,  1817-1819. 

Most  of  the  American  Schools  for  the  Deaf  which  have 
existed  for  a  time  and  then  been  discontinued  are  mentioned 
incidentally  in  the  foregoing  Histories.  It  seems  desirable,  for 
convenience  of  reference,  to  recapitulate  these,  adding  brief 
notices  of  such  as  have  not  already  been  spoken  of.  Two  of 
the  schools  which  are  not  mentioned  in  any  of  the  foregoing 
Histories,  namely,  Mr.  Bartlett's  and  Dr.  Bell's,  receive  fuUer 
treatment  in  separate  articles.

Schools  which  have  been  Discontinued.  5 

Mr.  J.  B.  Edwards's  School  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb, 

Lexington,  Georgia,  1856. 
Mr.  Edwards  was  a  former  pupil  of  the  American  Asylum 
at  Hartford.     He  carried  on  this  School  as  a  private  enter- 
prise, for  a  short  time,  at  his  father's  house. 


Dr.  Piatt  H.  Skinner's  School  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb,

Palls,  New  York,  1857-1860 ;  and  Trenton,  New  Jersey, 
1860-1866. 

Dr.  Piatt  H.  Skinner,  whose  wife,  Mrs.  Jerusha  M.  [Hills] 
Skinner,  had  formerly  been  a  pupil  and  afterwards  a  teacher 
in  the  New  York  Institution,  opened  his  School  in  Washing- 
ton in  1856.  Owing  to  circumstances  which  need  not  be  re- 
lated, the  School  was  broken  up  in  a  few  months.  He  then 
removed  to  Niagara  Falls  and  opened  a  school  there,  at  the 
same  time  publishing  a  small  newspaper  entitled  "  The  Mute 
and  the  Blind."  In  this  school  blind  children  as  well  as  deaf 
were  received,  and  colored  as  well  as  white.  In  1860  he  re- 
moved the  school  to  Trenton,  New  Jersey.  See  the  History  of 
the  New  Jersey  Institution  (Article  LXIX,  Volume  II),  pages

Home  for  the  Education  and  Maintenance  of  Young 
Deaf-Mutes,  New  York  City.  1859-1862. 
At  the  time  this  school  was  established  pupils  under  twelve 
years  of  age  were  not  admitted  into  the  New  York  Institution, 
which  was  then  the  only  school  for  the  deaf  in  the  State.  The 
object  of  the  Home  was  to  provide  for  the  instruction  of  these 
young  children,  especially  those  who  lived  in  New  York  city, 
and  were  subject  to  unfavorable  influences  in  their  own  homes. 
In  1862  the  law  of  the  State  was  so  changed  as  to  allow  ad- 
mission to  the  New  York  Institution  at  six  years  of  age,  and 
this  school  ceased  to  exist.  The  total  number  of  pupils  in- 
structed was  about  thirty,  and  their  ages  varied  from  four  to 
ten  years.

The  Class  for  Deaf-Mutesinthe  Cayuga  Lake  Academy, 
Aurora,  New  York,  1871-1879. 
The  Cayuga  Lake  Academy  was  a  school  for  hearing  youth, 
of  which  the  principal  was  Charles  Kelsey,  M.  A.  A  few  deaf 
pupils,  never  exceeding  four  in  number,  were  admitted,  and 
were  taught  by  Mrs.  Kelsey  by  the  oral  method.  They  asso- 
ciated with  the  hearing  pupils  out  of  school,  but  had  separate 
instruction  in  the  class-room.  In  1879  Mr.  Kelsey  was  ap- 
pointed superintendent  of  public  schools  at  Marquette,  Michi- 
gan, and  Mrs.  Kelsey's  class  in  the  Academy  was  discontinued. 


Schools  which  have  heen  Discontinued.  7 

The  New  Brunswick  Institution  for  the  Deaf  and 
Dumb,  St.  John  and  Portland,  New  Brunswick,  Canada, 
1873-1890. 

This  Institution  began  in  1873,  at  St.  John,  as  an  "  Evening 
and  Sunday  School,"  but  in  1884  became  a  boarding  establish- 
ment. It  was  conducted  by  Mr.  A.  H.  Abell,  a  graduate  of 
the  Halifax  Institution.  A  small  appropriation  was  received 
from  the  provincial  government,  but  the  Institution  depended 
mainly  upon  subscriptions  for  its  support.  In  1879  it  was 
transferred  from  St.  John  to  Portland,  in  St.  John  county,  and 
from  lack  of  funds  the  number  of  pupils,  which  at  one  time 
had  been  thirty-nine,  was  reduced  to  four.  In  1885  the  num- 
ber had  risen  to  twenty-five,  but  in  1890,  owing  to  the  estab- 
lishment of  the  Predericton  Institution,  the  school  was  dis- 
continued. 


Mr.  Syle's  Free  Evening  Class   for   Deaf-Mutes,  New 
York  City,  1874-1878. 

This  class  was  begun  in  November,  1874,  under  the  auspices 
of  the  Board  of  Education  of  New  York  city.  It  was  techni- 
cally a  class  of  the  evening  school  held  in  Grammar  School  No. 
40,  East  Twenty-third  street,  and  was  nominally  under  the 
principal  of  that  school ;  but,  in  fact,  Mr.  (afterwards  Eeverend) 
Henry  Winter  Syle,  formerly  a  teacher  in  the  New  York  Insti- 
tution, had  the  sole  control  and  direction  of  it.  It  met  three 
evenings  in  the  week,  from  6^  to  9  o'clock.  The  pupils  were 
mostly  persons  who  had  received  some  previous  instruction, 
and  were  engaged  during  the  day  in  earning  a  livelihood.  The 
instruction  given  them  in  the  evening  class  was  chiefly  in  mat- 
ters of  practical  importance  to  them  in  their  trades  and  other 
business,  especially  mechanical  drawing,  book-keeping,  and 
colloquial  language.  Several  of  the  pupils  had  been  educated 
in  German  schools,  and  joined  the  class  in  order  to  acquire  a 
knowledge  of  English. 

In  1875  Mr.  Syle  resigned  the  direction  of  the  class  to  accept 
a  position  in  the  United  States  Mint  at  Philadelphia,  and  was 
succeeded  by  Mr.  James  S.  Wells,  a  graduate  of  the  New  York 
Institution,  formerly  a  teacher  in  the  Texas  School.  Under 
Mr.  Syle's  administration  the  average  number  of  pupils  in  at- 
tendance had  been  33.  After  he  withdrew  the  number  was 
diminished,  and  in  1878  the  class  ceased  to  exist. 


8  Schools  which  have  been  Discontinued. 

The  Erie  Day-School  for  Deaf-Mutes,  Erie,  Pennsylvania, 

1874-1884. 

The  Erie  Day-School  was  begun  through  the  efforts  of  Mr. 
Williani  Himrod,  a  gentleman  of  that  city,  who  had  a  deaf  son. 
On  inquiry  he  found  several  other  deaf  children  in  the  city,  and 
bringing  the  subject  to  the  attention  of  the  city  School  Board, 
succeeded  in  September,  1875,  in  having  a  class  organized  under 
the  control  of  the  Board.  Mr.  Nic  Bohnen,  a  teacher  in  one 
of  the  public  schools,  who  had  taught  the  deaf  for  two  years 
in  Germany,  took  charge  of  the  class.  At  first  he  taught  it 
only  for  one  hour  in  the  morning  and  another  in  the  afternoon, 
continuing  to  conduct  his  class  of  hearing  children  during  the 
other  hours  of  school ;  but  after  a  few  months  he  gave  up  his 
hearing  class,  and  devoted  his  whole  time  to  the  deaf  children. 
The  oral  method  of  instruction  was  followed. 

In  1876  Mrs.  A.  D.  Boss  took  charge  of  the  class.  She  was 
succeeded  in  1879  by  Miss  Mary  Welsh.  The  highest  number 
of  pupils  reported  at  any  time  was  11.  In  1884  the  School 
ceased  to  exist. 

The  Alleghany  City  Day-School  for  the  Deaf  and 
Dumb,  AUeghany  City,  Pennsylvania,  1875-1876. 
The  Alleghany  City  Day-School  was  begun  in  1875  by  Mr. 
Archy  Woodside,  a  graduate  of  the  Pennsylvania  Institution, 
who  had  been  at  the  head  of  the  Pittsburgh  Day-School  since 
its  establishment.  On  the  discontinuance  of  the  Alleghany 
City  School,  in  the  following  year,  its  pupils  were  placed  in 
the  Western  Pennsylvania  Institution.

Mrs.  Kelsey's  School  of  Articulation,  Marquette,  Michi- 
gan, 1879-1883. 
Mrs.  A.  M.  Kelsey,  who  had  taught  a  class  of  deaf  children  in 
the  Cayuga  Lake  Academy,  Aurora,  New  York,  for  several  years, 
removed  to  Marquette,  Michigan,  in  1879,  and  opened  a  private 
school  taught  by  the  oral  method.  The  number  of  pupils 
never  exceeded  three,  and  the  School  was  discontinued  in 
1883.

The    Philadelphia    Day-School  for  Deaf-Mutes,  Phila- 
delphia, Pennsylvania,  1880-1881. 

The  Philadelphia  Day-Sohool  for  Deaf-Mutes  was  opened 
in  1880  at  707  Fairmount  avenue,  Philadelphia,  by  Mr.  Jerome 
T.  Elwell,  a  graduate  of  the  Pennsylvania  Institution  and  of 
the  National  College.  It  began  as  a  private  school,  but  v?ith 
the  hope  that  it  would  be  adopted  either  as  a  branch  of  the 
Pennsylvania  Institution  or  of  the  school  system  under  the 
direction  of  the  city  Board  of  Education.  The  manual 
method  of  instruction  was  followed.  In  the  following  year 
Mr.  Elwell  was  appointed  a  teacher  in  the  Pennsylvania 
Institution,  and  an  oral  day-school  having  been  established  as 
a  branch  of  that  Institution,  this  school  was  discontinued.

10  Schools  which  have  heen  Discontinued. 

Miss  Mary  S.  Garrett's  Private  School  for  Teaching 
Deaf  Children  to  Speak,  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania, 
1885-1889. 
This  School  was  opened  January  12,  1885,  by  Miss  Mary  S. 
Garrett,  who  had  previously  been  a  teacher  in  the  Oral  Branch 
of  the  Pennsylvania  Institution.     It  began  with  seven  pupils, 
who  had  been  under  Miss  Garrett's  instruction  in  that  Insti- 
tution, and  others  afterwards  entered,  the  highest  number  re- 
ported in  attendance  being  fourteen.     The  School  was  discon- 
tinued in  1889,  because  the  Oral  School  at  Sorauton  became  a 
boarding-school  that  year,  and   such  of  the  pupils  as  did  not 
go  to  work  at  that  time  were  sent  there. 

The  seven  boys  who  constituted  the  first  pupils  are  aU  at 
work  now.  One  is  a  printer,  two  make  dental  instruments, 
one  is  employed  part  of  the  time  by  a  photographer  and  the 
rest  of  the  time  does  designing  and  painting,  one  is  a  cigar- 
maker,  another  works  with  his  father  who  is  a  sexton  and  car- 
penter, and  another  works  for  his  father  in  his  brickyard. 

The  New  Orleans  Public  School  for  Deaf-Mutes,  New 

Orleans,  Louisiana,  1886-1891. 
This  School  was  opened  in  January,  1886.  It  was  supported 
by  the  city  as  a  part  of  the  public-school  system.  The  teacher 
was  Mr.  Robert  B.  Lawrence,  a  graduate  of  the  New  York  In- 
stitution. The  manual  method  of  instruction  was  followed. 
The  School  had  sixteen  pupils  at  the  outset,  but  the  number

continued.

MR.    BAETLETT'S    FAMILY    SCHOOL     FOR    YOUNG 
DEAF-MUTE  CHILDREN. 

Until  the  opening  of  this  School  in  1852  pupils  were  not 
received  into  the  American  schools  for  the  deaf  until  they  were 
ten  or  twelve  years  of  age.  In  most  of  the  schools  twelve  was 
the  lowest  age  at  which  they  could  be  admitted  at  the  expense 
of  the  State.  Parents  often  brought  their  children  hundreds 
of  miles  and  pleaded  for  their  admission,  but  in  vain.  The 
children  had  to  return  to  their  homes,  and  lose  in  idleness  the 
precious  years  best  adapted  to  the  acquisition  of  language. 


DAVID   ELY  BARTLETT,    M.    A. 


Mr.  David  Ely  Bartlett,  a  graduate  of  Yale  College,  for 
twenty-four  years  an  instructor  of  the  deaf  in  the  Hartford  and 
New  York  Institutions,  a  man  of  remarkable  energy,  vigor,  en- 
thasiasm,  and  devotion,  became  convinced,  in  the  course  of  his 
experience  as  a  teacher,  that  the  exclusion  of  young  deaf  chil- 
dren from  instruction  was  a  great  loss  and  injury  to  them,  and 
determined  to  try  the  experiment  of  a  school  to  which  they 
should  be  admitted  at  as  early  an  age  as  their  parents  were 
willing  to  entrust  them  to  his  care.  Accordingly,  in  February, 
1852,  he  issued  the  following  circular : 

The  undersigned,  having  been  for  more  than  twenty  years  engaged  in 
the  instruction  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  at  the  American  Asylum  for  the 
Deaf  and  Dumb,  Hartford,  Conn.,  and  at  the  New  York  Institution  for 
the  Deaf  and  Dumb  in  the  city  of  New  York,  has  had  abundant  opportu-

nity  for  finding  out  and  learning  to  appreciate  the  peculiar  wants  of  this 
class  of  pupils,  and  the  peculiar  difiSculties  connected  with  this  depart- 
ment of  education.  He  has,  moreover,  learned  to  sympathize  with  the 
parents  of  deaf-mute  children,  in  the  difficulties  which  they  meet  in  the 
management  of  their  children  previous  to  their  education  at  school. 
Applications  are  often  made  by  the  parents  and  guardians  of  deaf-mute 
children  for  their  admission  into  our  public  institutions  for  the  deaf  and 
dumb  at  an  earlier  age  than  is  rendered  practicable  by  the  rules  of  these 
establishments. 

With  a  view  of  affording  to  such  parents  and  guardians  an  opportunity 
of  securing  the  early  education  of  their  children  which  they  desire,  the 
undersigned  has  made  provision  for  the  instruction  and  training  of  a 
select  number  of  young  deaf-mutes  in  his  family. 

The  result  of  an  experiment  he  has  been  making  with  some  little  deaf- 
mutes,  from  six  to  ten  years  of  age,  for  a  few  months  past,  has  greatly 
strengthened  and  increased  his  belief  in  the  practicability  and  advantage 
of  beginning  early  the  education  of  the  deaf  and  dumb. 

The  plan  of  training  that  he  proposes  is  one  adapted  to  the  physical, 
mental,  and  moral  wants  of  children  of  an  early  and  tender  age,  and  to 
their  advancing  years. 

Parents  and  guardians  of  deaf-mute  children  who  may  be  wishing  for 
their  children  instruction  of  this  kind  may  obtain  the  opportunity  they 
desire  by  applying  to  the  undersigned,  Fiftieth  street,  New  York,  four 
doors  west  of  the  New  York  Institution  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb. 

D.  E.  BAKTLETT. 

New  Yoek,  Febi-uary  16,  1852. 

References,  testimonials,  and  other  information  will  be  given  to  those 
who  may  wish  for  them. 

Mr.  Bartlett  opened  the  School  soon  after  the  publication  of 
this  circular.  Besides  deaf  children,  he  received  several  hear- 
ing children,  the  brothers  and  sisters  of  the  deaf  pupils. 
Their  parents  thought — and  Mr.  Bartlett  encouraged  them  in 
the  idea — that  the  co-education  of  deaf  and  hearing  brothers 
and  sisters  would  be  mutually  advantageous.  The  deaf  child 
would  have  the  comijanionship  of  one  or  more  persons  from 
his  own  home,  and  the  benefit  of  conversation  with  hearing 
children  in  verbal  language  out  of  school-hours ;  while  the 
hearing  child  would  acquire  the  abiUty  to  use  signs  and  the 
manual  alphabet  rapidly  and  fluently,  and  so  to  become  a 
ready  interpreter  between  the  deaf  child  and  the  other  mem- 
bers of  the  family  at  home. 

Mr.  Bartlett  admitted  children  into  his  School  at  the  ages 
of  four  and  a  half,  five,  six,  and  seven  years.  He  did  not  con- 
fine the  little  ones  at  first  to  a  regular  routine  of  exercises,  but 
endeavored  to  accustom  them — at  the  table,  in  their  games 
and  walks,  and  in  all  the  incidents  of  every-day  life — to  think

and  express  their  thoughts  in  alphabetic  language,  thus  mak- 
ing the  acquisition  of  language  a  matter  of  imitation,  practice, 
and  habit,  as  it  is  with  hearing  children. 

Two  years  after  the  School  was  opened,  the  father  of  one  of 
the  pupils,  writing  of  it  in  a  New  York  paper,  said  : 

Mr.  Bartlett's  pupils  compose  his  family  ;  the  children  evince  by  their 
manners  that  kind  of  confident,  trusting  familiarity  which  one  expects 
to  see  in  a  well-governed  home,  and  their  smiling,  gleeful  faces  express 
their  happiness  and  contentment.  The  family  and  the  School,  are,  how- 
ever, so  intimately  blended  that  it  is  impossible  to  speak  of  the  one  as 
distinct  from  the  other,  and  hence  any  minute  description  of  every-day 
life  in  the  house  would  seem  to  be  a  violation  of  the  sanctity  of  a  private 
home. 

I  cannot,  however,  refrain  from  saying  of  Mr.  Bartlett  that  he  is  wel 
known  to  all  interested  in  the  education  of  deaf-mutes,  especially  in  New 
York,  as  an  accomplished  scholar  and  thoroughly  a  Christian  gentleman. 
No  one  can  see  him,  as  I  have  seen  him,  without  a  conviction  that  he  is 
animated  by  all  that  patient  ze^l,  devotion,  energy,  capacity,  and  culti- 
vation that  go  to  make  up  the  character  of  the  philanthropist.  His 
excellent,  accomplished,  and  beautiful  wife  will,  I  trust,  pardon  me  for 
saying  that  she  is  literally  a  helpmeet  for  such  a  man. 

Beside  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Bartlett,  there  is  a  young  lady  (a  deaf-mute),  who 
is  an  assistant  teacher ;  a  governess,  also  a  deaf-mute,  and  others,  who 
have  the  care  of  the  children. 

Mr.  Bartlett  believes  that  his  pupils  are  to  be  won  and  led,  not  driven  ; 
and  let  any  person  behold  this  little  household  joining  their  teacher,  at 
the  close  of  the  school,  in  an  earnest  though  voiceless  acknowledgment 
to  God  for  his  goodness,  and  a  prayer  for  his  blessing  and  favor,  and 
they  will  soon  see  upon  what  foundation  the  teacher  builds. 

The  land  about  the  house  is  extensive  and  well  cultivated.  The  play- 
ground is  ample,  and  every  facility  given  for  the  development  of  the 
bodily  powers  and  the  cultivation  of  such  tastes  for  mechanical  or  other 
pursuits  as  the  pupils  may  display. 

I  have  written  thus  much,  not  for  the  purpose  of  puffing  one  whom  I 
am  proud  to  speak  of  as  a  friend,  but  because  I  believe  there  are  many 
parents  in  the  State  who  will  rejoice  to  know  that  such  a  school  as  I 
have  imperfectly  described  is  in  successful  operation.  I  am  the  father 
of  a  deaf-mute  son,  now  nine  years  old,  and  I  consider  myself  so  fortunate 
in  being  able  to  place  him  in  the  hands  of  such  a  man  as  Mr.  Bartlett 
that  I  desire  to  have  other  parents,  similarly  interested,  know  that  there 
is  such  a  School,  so  conducted  that  they  may  lay  aside  all  fear  and 
anxiety,  and  entrust  their  children  confidently  to  its  influences.  Of  the 
teacher,  I  can  say,  conscientiously,  that  I  believe  no  man  was  ever  more 
peculiarly  qualified  to  supply  a  peculiar  want  than  is  Mr.  Bartlett. 

Of  the  results  of  the  experiment  of  educating  deaf  and  hear- 
ing brothers  and  sisters  in  the  same  school,  Mr.  Bartlett  said  :*

We  find  this  beneficial  to  both  classes — to  the  deaf-mutes  in  enlarging 
their  scope  of  thought  by  bringing  their  minds  into  contact  with  those  of 
their  more  favored  companions  ;  beneficial  yet  more  -variously  to  those 
who  hear  and  speak,  quickening  their  perception,  and  improving  their 
mental  development  by  presenting  to  their  minds  language  under  entirely 
new  forms;  by  the  use  of  the  manual  alphabet  in  spelling  words ;  and 
also  by  the  by  no  means  inconsiderable  advantage  of  improved  ease  and 
expressiveness  of  manner,  induced  by  practice  in  the  use  of  gesture  lan- 
guage. 

The  late  Kev.  Henry  Winter  Syle,  who  was  a  pupil  in  Mr. 
Bartlett's  School  nearly  the  whole  time  of  its  existence,  many 
years  later  expressed  the  following  opinion  of  the  value  of  this 
associative  feature  of  the  School :  * 

I  think  my  old  schoolmates,  as  a  rule,  take  larger  and  more  sensible 
views  than  deaf-mutes  trained  in  an  institution.  They  are  not  so  clan- 
nish, and  their  minds  did  not  get  into  a  rut  at  school.  They  think  and 
feel  as  hearing  people  do.  *  *  *  I  believe  a  distinct  and  powerful  in- 
fluence was  exerted  by  the  association,  the  admixture  of  hearing  children, 
between  whom  and  the  deaf  there  was  perfect  equality  in  every  respect, 
save  where  a  difference  was  made  absolutely  necessary  bj'  the  fact  of 
deafness.  Hearing  and  deaf  children  slept  in  the  same  room,  sat  at  the 
same  table,  mixed  together,  sat  side  by  side  at  the  prayers  (which  were 
conducted  in  signs),  and,  in  certain  studies,  they  were  together  in  the 
class,  and  all  recited  manually.  *  *  *  n  was  this  association,  I  have 
no  doubt,  that  contributed  largely  to  make  my  schoolmates  feel  at  home 
and  at  ease  in  hearing  society — that  enabled  them  to  understand  how 
hearing  people  viewed  things,  and  to  view  them  in  the  same  way,  naturally 
and  habitually,  not  in  a  forced  and  foreign  way. 

The  number  of  pupils  who  attended  the  School  for  longer 
or  shorter  periods  during  the  eight  years  of  its  existence  was 
about  thirty.  Few  of  them  received  then-  entire  school  educa- 
tion here  ;  after  remaining  a  year  or  two  thej'  were  generally 
transferred  to  public  schools  for  the  deaf. 

The  School  was  not  successful  jDecuniaiily,  but  in  other  re- 
spects the  results  of  the  experiment  fully  equalled  Mr.  Bart- 
lett's expectations.  The  development  of  the  children's  minds 
through  the  free  use  of  the  sign-language  at  an  early  age,  and 
the  exercise  of  their  mental  powers  in  acquiring  the  elements 
of  verbal  language  by  a  method  of  instruction  adapted  to  their 
years,  prepared  them  for  rapid  advancement  in  their  future 
course,  and  in  due  time  gave  them  a  fuller  and  freer  use  of 
language  than  is  usually  acquired  by  deaf-mutes.  The  late  Mr. 
George  Wing,  an  intelligent  and  unprejudiced  observer,  who

"was  not  educated  at  this  School,  but  knew  some  of  its  pupils 
in  later  life,  wrote,  a  few  years  ago,  concerning  them :  * 

Several  of  Professor  Bartlett's  former  pupils  have  been  for  many  years 
among  my  intimate  friends  and  associates.  Some  of  them  are  remarkable 
examples  of  deaf-mutes,  from  infancy  using  -written  language  with  all  the 
freedom  and  accuracy  of  educated  hearing  persons.  One  of  them,  a  lady 
deaf  from  birth,  attributes  her  remarkable  facility  in  the  use  of  language 
mainly  to  her  learning  at  the  start  to  think  in  language.  Childish  and 
imperfect  though  it  was,  the  language  she  used  was  a  limng  language. 
The  words  and  sentences  spelled  with  her  childish  fingers  were  spelled 
with  the  purpose  of  communicating  thought,  and  the  signs  habitually 
used  were  representatives,  rather  than  pictures,  of  thought,  taking  much 
of  their  cast  and  sequence  from  the  mental  habits  of  the  hearing  chil- 
dren. Thus  the  entering  wedge  was  driven  and  the  way  opened  for  the 
acquirement  of  education  by  a  natural  process. 

Another  is  a  lady  who  taught  for  several  years  in  the  Minnesota  Insti- 
tution. She  is  one  of  the  few  congenital  deaf-mutes  among  my  acquaint- 
ances who  are  thoroughly  emancipated  from  deaf-mutism.  I  took  it  for 
granted  that  she  was  a  "  semi-mute."  In  the  course  of  an  intimate  ac- 
quaintance, extending  over  a  period  of  ten  years,  I  never  observed  any 
of  the  grammatical  slips  or  queer  solecisms  to  which  even  the  best  edu- 
cated deaf-mutes  are  liable.  In  questioning  her  as  to  her  recollection  of 
Professor  Bartlett's  School,  I  was  surprised  to  learn  that  she  became  to- 
tally deaf  before  she  was  a  year  old.  She  most  emphatically  declares 
that  she  traces  the  ease  and  freedom  with  which  she  uses  language  to 
her  early  instruction  and  association  at  Poughkeepsie. 

Another  of  my  acquaintances,  a  comrade  of  my  school-boy  days,  be- 
came totally  deaf  when  about  six  years  old.  He  was  placed  in  Professor 
Bartlett's  care  when  seven  years  old,  and  remained  until  he  entered  a 
New  England  college.  He  is  a  finished  scholar  and  a  writer  of  great 
merit.  His  case  is  hardly  in  point,  as  he  had  the  advantage  of  hearing 
and  speech  in  childhood  ;  but,  making  due  allowance  for  this  advantage 
and  for  unusual  native  ability,  much  remains  to  the  credit  of  early  in-  • 
struction  and  association. 

Still  another  of  Professor  Bartlett's  pupils  I  remember  as  a  bright 
boy,  remarkable  for  the  clearness  and  precision  of  his  use  of  signs.  In 
written  language  he  was,  at  the  time  I  knew  him,  decidedly  "  lame." 
He  did  not  "  take  kindly  "  to  the  change  from  Professor  Bartlett's  un- 
systematic methods  to  the  logical  and  methodical  ways  of  the  teacher 
under  whom  he  was  placed.  He  was  fonder  of  sketching  and  caricatur- 
ing his  comrades  and  teachers  than  of  study.  In  his  subsequent  life, 
however,  he  has  developed  remarkable  talent  in  many  ways.  If  success 
in  life,  the  ability  to  "  carve  one's  way  to  fame  and  fortune,"  is  a  crite- 
rion of  success  in  educational  methods,  then  this  is  a  case  of  more  than 
ordinary  success  in  educational  methods. 

The  success  of  Mr.  Bartlett's  School,  no  doubt,  had  much 
influence  in  changing  professional  and  public  opinion  as  to  the

proper  age  for  the  admission  of  deaf  children  to  school.  Two 
years  before  the  School  was  opened,  the  Convention  of  Ameri- 
can Instructors  of  the  Deaf,  meeting  in  New  York,  had  passed 
a  resolution  expressing  the  opinion  that  it  was  inexpedient  to 
receive  pupUs,  except  in  special  cases,  under  the  age  of  ten, 
and  that  twelve  would  be  a  more  suitable  age  unless  it  would 
interfere  with  the  length  of  time  spent  in  school ;  ten  years 
later  the  law  of  New  York  was  so  changed  that  pupils  could 
be  admitted  at  the  age  of  six,  and  the  Umit  has  since  then 
been  more  or  less  reduced  in  nearly  all  the  schools  of  the 
country,  while  several  schools  have  been  established  for  the 
express  purpose  of  receiving  very  young  children. 

Mr.  Bartlett  began  his  School  in  Fiftieth  street.  New  York, 
near  the  New  York  Institution.  The  following  year  it  was  re- 
moved temporarily  to  Fishkill  Landing,  on  the  east  bank  of 
the  Hudson  river,  opposite  Newburg.  In  1854  it  was  estab- 
lished at  Poughkeepsie,  New  York ;  in  1860  it  was  transferred 
to  Hartford,  Connecticut,  and  a  year  later  it  ceased  to  exist. 
During  the  remainder  of  his  life  Mr.  Bartlett  was  a  valued 
teacher  in  the  American  Asylum,  at  Hartford.  He  died  in 
1879,  in  years  aged  seventy-four,  but  in  spirit  still  in  the  en- 
joyment of  perpetual  youth.

SCHOOL. 

The  causes  which  led  to  the  establishment  of  this  School 
are  thus  referred  to  in  an  address  delivered  by  its  founder  to 
a  select  audience,  October  9,  1883,  shortly  after  its  opening : 

Many  years  ago  I  became  interested  in  the  education  of  the  deaf,  and 
anxious  for  an  opportunity  to  see  what  I  could  do  in  teaching  little  chil- 
dren. I  desired  to  get  a  very  young  child  to  experiment  with.  It  so 
happened  that  a  little  boy  five  years  of  age  was  brought  to  me,  and  I 
offered  to  undertake  his  general  education,  although  I  never  had  had 
anything  to  do  directly  with  the  education  of  the  deaf  before.  I  began 
to  study  general  methods,  but  found  great  difficulties  in  all,  because  all 
the  methods  I  studied  were  adapted  to  children  of  maturer  years.  Here 
was  a  child  of  five.  In  many  institutions  children  are  not  admitted  till 
they  are  ten  years  of  age.  I  studied  the  different  works  I  could  get  hold 
of,  and  finally  decided  to  adopt  a  method  that  was  nowhere  in  use  ;  that 
was  the  method  proposed  by  George  Dalgarno  two  hundred  years  ago. 
I  adopted  his  plan  of  teaching  a  deaf  child  to  read  and  write  in  a  natu- 
ral way,  just  as  we  teach  hearing  children  to  speak  their  mother  tongue. 
Instead  of  commencing  the  A,  B,  C's,  I  adopted  his  plan  of  writing  to 
the  child  as  I  would  speak  to  a  hearing  child. 

As  George  Dalgarno  predicted,  the  child  came  to  understand  the  writ- 
ing, just  as  a  hearing  child  comes  to  understand  spoken  words.  Then  it 
came  about  that  the  child  wanted  to  write  himself.  At  first,  of  course, 
he  did  not  have  ready  command  of  his  hands  and  fingers.  He  would 
make  known  by  gestures  and  signs  what  he  wanted  to  write,  and  I  would 
write  it.  Then  I  would  partially  erase  my  writing  and  have  him  trace 
it  over.  After  that  stage  was  reached  he  learned  his  letters  so  that  he 
could  be  able  to  put  new  words  together. 

The  experiment  with  this  single  child  was  a  great  success.  Dalgarno 
had  not  considered  very  fully  the  method  of  teaching  speech.  I  adopted 
the  system,  devised  by  my  father,  of  Visible  Speech.  That  boy,  in  one 
year,  was  using  writing  materials.  He  wrote  about  everything  that  he 
wanted  to  communicate  to  his  friends.  The  floor  would  be  strewn  with 
little  scraps  of  paper  on  which  he  had  jotted  his  thoughts.  Very  many 
of  these  messages  were  grammatical.  Some  of  them  were  very  odd, 
indeed. 

Shortly  after  that  the  need  of  developing  the  speaking  telephone  took 
my  thoughts  away  from  the  subject,  and  for  a  number  of  years  I  had  no 
practical  connection  with  the  instruction  of  the  deaf. 

Inquiries,  however,  as  to  the  cause  of  this  boy's  remarkable 
knowledge  of  written  language  led  to  the  publication  by  Dr. 


4  Dr.  BelVs  Private  Experimental  School. 

Bell  in  the  American  Annals  of  the  Deaf*  of  an  account  of 
the  lad's  early  training.  After  this  he  received  many  letters 
of  inquiry  from  parents  of  deaf  and  dumb  children  anxious  to 
do  something  for  their  children  at  home.  He  sent  out  to  these 
parents  copies  of  his  article,  and  afterwards  received  notes 
from  them  stating  that  they  were  delighted  with  the  progress 
made  by  their  children.  This,  he  thought,  showed  that  a 
great  deal  could  be  done  with  children  at  a  very  much  younger 
age  than  that  at  which  they  were  admitted  to  institutions  for 
the  instruction  of  the  deaf  and  dumb.  A  cruel  wrong,  he 
thought,  was  done  to  the  deaf  child  in  not  teaching  it  language. 
How  does  he  think  ?  [said  Dr.  Bell  on  one  occasion.]  If  we  try  to 
eliminate  from  our  consciousness  the  train  of  words  in  which  our  thoughts 
take  form,  it  is  hard  to  realize  what  remains,  yet  what  remains  is  all  the 
thought  of  a  deaf  child.  The  printed  page  of  a  book  means  no  more  to 
him,  without  instruction,  than  a  page  of  Chinese  does  to  us.  How,  then, 
does  his  mind  grow  ?  Chiefly  by  his  own  observation.  If  you  watch  the 
growth  of  the  minds  of  hearing  children,  you  will  be  astonished  to  dis- 
cover how  much  they  are  developed  by  hearing  the  experiences  of  others. 
The  deaf  child  is  cut  off  in  a  great  degree  from  the  experiences  of  others. 
If  left  to  grow  up  in  this  way,  the  condition  of  his  mind  is  lamentable. 
In  order  to  understand  it,  we  must  consider  what  our  minds  would  be  if 
we  eliminated  everything  we  ever  heard  of  or  read  of.  That  is  the  con- 
dition of  the  deaf  child  that  grows  up  without  instruction — ignorance  of 
a  depth  that  cannot  be  realized  ;  a  meageruess  of  conception  of  abstract 
things  hardly  conceivable.  It  is  an  ignorance  that  is  dangerous,  and 
upon  that  danger  to  society  rests  the  chief  argument  in  favor  of  the 
public  instruction  of  the  deaf. 

Early  in  the  fall  of  the  year  1883  a  distressed  mother  called 
upon  Dr.  Bell  to  consult  him  in  regard  to  a  bright  little  child, 
aged  four  years,  which  had  suddenly  lost  its  hearing  a  few 
months  previous,  and  whose  speech  in  consequence,  for  want 
of  intelligent  attention,  was  rapidly  becoming  so  impaired  that 
it  materially  hindered  intercourse  and  rendered  the  child  ex- 
tremely fretful  and  impatient.  The  mother's  distress,  the  ab- 
sence of  any  school  where  such  a  child,  however  bright,  might 
be  sent  for  instruction,  and  his  conviction  that  prompt  action 
would  result  in  retaining  the  gift  of  speech,  which  the  deaf 
child  yet  possessed,  combined  to  decide  his  undertaking  the 
work  himself,  and  to  this  end  he  established  at  once  what 
he  termed  an  Experimental  School.  First  of  all,  he  de- 
termined to  secure  the  services  of  a  trained  kindergarten 
teacher  unfamiliar  with,   and  therefore  impartial  as  to,  the

prevailing  methods  of  teaching  the  deaf,  but  possessing  all 
the  requisite  qualifications  for  the  work  he  proposed  to 
engage  in.  At  the  instance  of  Professor  J.  O.  Wilson,  then 
Buperintendent  of  public  schools,  he  finally  secured  the  serv- 
ices of  Miss  Gertrude  Hitz,  of  Washington,  D.  C,  and, 
having  prepared  all  requisite  preliminaries,  opened  his  School 
on  the  1st  day  of  October,  1883.      A  reporter  of   one  of  the 


MI!5S   GERTBUDE  HITZ. 


daUy  papers,  vrho  called  in  at  the  close  of  its  first  month  of 
existence,  gives  in  substance  the  following  interesting  account 
of  it,  and  the  method  of  instruction  pursued  :  * 

In  the  midst  of  the  splendid  residences  that  surround  Scott  Circle 
there  still  stands  a  little  old-fashioned  brick  house.  Ketired  from  the 
street,  with  its  modest  front  partially  concealed  by  growing  vines,  it  seems 
to  court  seclusion,  as  if  overcome  by  the  magnificence  of  its  neighbors, 
and  in  a  deprecatory  way  to  apologize  for  its  audacity  in  daring  to  be  in 
such  company.  The  lawn  which  bends  about  the  front  and  side  of  the 
house,  conforming  in  shape  to  the  segment  of  the  circle  upon  which  it 
faces,  is,  like  the  house,  old-fashioned,  with  its  hedge  and  vine-covered 
arbor.  There  is,  however,  about  the  house  and  grounds  just  now  the 
sweet  gladness  of  childish  voices  and  laughter,  which  is  never  old-fash- 
ioned. The  merry  groups  pouring  out  of  the  doors  and  flitting  about 
the  lawn  in  gleeful  play  form  a  picture  of  loveliness  about  the  old  place

wbieh  contrasts  sharply  with  the  stately  silence  of  magnificence  all; 
around  it.  If  any  one  should  attempt  to  pass  up  the  walk  which  leads  to 
the  front  entrance,  as  a  Star  reporter  did  the  other  day,  he  must  remem- 
ber to  go  slowly  ;  for  the  little  ones  are  all  about,  and  they  are  playing 
games,  and  a  thoughtless  hand  or  a  careless  foot  might  commit  irrepara- 
ble injury  and  bring  the  quiver  to  the  mouth  or  the  tear  to  the  eye  of 
some  sweet  baby  face.  So,  by  carefully  going  around  some  mystic  circle 
of  little  toddlers,  or  edging  past  a  tiny  savant  deep  in  geological  delving 
and  dirt,  the  visitor  finds  himself  on  the  front  porch.  Through  the  wide 
open  door  a  glance  reveals  the  hallway  and  stairs,  covered  with  a  rich, 
soft  carpet,  and  a  long  room  at  the  side.  A  young  lady  answers  the 
summons  of  the  bell  and  the  visitor  inquires  : 

"  Is  this  Mr.  Alexander  Graham  Bell's  school  for  deaf-mutes  ?" 

"  It  is,"  replies  the  young  lady,  and  then,  with  an  inquiring  look  at  the 
stranger,  she  continues:  ''Mr.  Bell  is  at  present  in  the  school-room; 
who  shall  I  say  called  ?  " 

Her  question  had  a  suggestive  sound,  and  imparted  au  air  of  remote- 
ness, as  if  she  had  said,  "  Mr.  Bell  is  at  present  at  the  North  Pole  ;  who 
shall  I  say  called  ?  " 

With  some  misgivings,  therefore,  the  visitor  produced  a  card,  and  the 
young  lady  was  obliging  enough  to  take  it  upstairs. 

Presently  Mr.  Bell  himself  came  down  and  greeted  the  visitor  in  his 
cordial  manner. 

"I  have  come  to  see  your  new  school,"  said  the  reporter,  rather 
abruptly. 

"  It  is  a  new  school  in  every  sense  of  the  word,"  replied  Mr.  Bell,  as 
he  led  the  way  into  the  front  room  and  took  a  seat.  ' '  We  have  hardly 
taken  possession  yet  of  this  building.  We  are  still  moving  from  the 
other  house  which  we  have  been  occupying  since  October  1st.  I  have 
rented  this  house  for  a  year,  and  it  is  about  ready  for  use." 

"  The  children  seem  to  be  rather  talkative  for  mutes,"  observed  the 
reporter,  as  a  flood  of  childish  chatter  and  laughter  floated  in  through  the 
doorway  and  windows. 

Mr.  Bell  smiled,  and  said  : 

"  I  will  show  you  my  school.  These  rooms  down-stairs  are  for  the  use 
of  a  kindergarten  school,  and  the  children  playing  outside  are  the  schol- 
ars. The  school  for  deaf-mutes  is  upstairs,  and  it  is  the  only  school  of 
the  kind  in  the  country,  for  the  reason  that  it  is  an  attempt  to  educate 
the  two  classes  of  very  young  chirldren  together.  Perhaps  you  are  not 
aware,"  he  continued,  in  an  earnest  tone  of  voice,  showing  that  he  was 
deeply  interested  in  the  subject,  "  that  there  have  been  two  methods  of 
educating  deaf-mutes.  The  first,  by  placing  them  in  schools  with  other 
children.  The  result  of  this  has  always  been  that  one  class  of  children 
has  been  neglected  for  the  other,  and  justice  done  to  neither.  Then  the 
deaf-mutes  were  placed  in  institutions  by  themselves,  and  this  has  had 
the  unfortunate  tendency  of  keeping  them  separate  and  apart  from  the 
rest  of  the  world.  Now,  in  this  school,  I  propose  to  try  a  new  experi- 
ment, which  will  be  the  mean  between  these  two  systems.  The  deaf  chil- 
dren will  be  instructed  by  themselves,  but  they  will  play  with  the  hearing 
children  in  the  play-ground,  and  join  them  for  an  hour  or  so  every  day  in 


Dr.  BelVs  Private  Experimental  School.  7 

the  kindergarten  occupations.  The  deaf  children  will  watch  the  actions 
of  the  hearing  children  and  see  them  talk,  and  thus  in  their  play-hours, 
they  will  acquire  facility  in  the  articulation  method,  which  we  will  trj^  to 
teach  them.  Children  learn  more  rapidly  from  each  other  than  they  do 
from  older  persons,  as  any  parent  will  tell  you,  and  these  little  ones  will 
supplement  the  instruction  given  to  their  less  fortunate  companions. 

"But  come  upstairs,  and  you  will  see  the  school  in  operation,"  ex- 
claimed the  inventor,  as  he  rose  to  lead  the  way. 

"  This  is  our  school-room." 

It  did  not  look  like  any  school-room  the  reporter  had  ever  seen  before. 
It  might  have  been  a  parlor.  The  doorways  and  windows  were  hun^f 
with  handsome  curtains  and  portieres,  and  the  floor  was  covered  with  a. 
soft  rug.  There  were  no  desks  or  maps,  and  in  the  recess  formed  by  the 
bay-window  was  a  cute  little  divan  that  ran  all  around  it,  just  high 
enough  for  the  little  ones  to  climb  up  on  the  soft  cushion.  There  were 
pictures  on  the  walls,  and  ornaments  on  the  mantel  and  in  the  cabinets. 
But,  after  all,  the  charm  of  the  room  was  not  in  these  things,  but  rather 
in  the  group  of  fair-haired  children  that  clustered  in  a  circle  about  a  low 
table  which  stood  in  the  centre  of  the  floor.  They  were  playing  some 
little  game  with  pieces  of  pasteboard,  and  the  teacher,  a  young  lady, 
seemed  to  be  as  absorbed  in  the  amusement  as  were  the  children.  Pres- 
ently the  group  dissolved,  and  a  new  game  was  begun  under  the  guiding 
direction  of  the  teacher,  who  was  employing  the  kindergarten  method. 

"That  little  girl  over  there,"  remarked  Mr.  Bell,  pointing  to  a  child 
whose  merry  face  was  wreathed  in  smiles,  and  who  looked  the  picture  of 
health  and  happiness,  "  lost  her  hearing  some  time  ago,  and  since  theit 
she  has  been  gradually  losing  the  power  of  speech.  She  can  talk  but 
very  little  now,  and  in  a  short  time,  if  she  continues  shut  off  from  the 
speaking  world,  she  will  lose  the  faculty  of  speech  entirely.  She  can 
now  be  made  to  understand  only  a  very  few  things.  You  can't  tell  the 
child  anything,  for  you  have  no  way  of  making  her  understand.  She  is 
gradually  forgetting  how  to  talk." 

The  little  girl,  now  six  years  of  age,  still  retains  some  few  words  of 
speech,  but  it  was  the  baby  jjrattle  which  she  had  used  before  she  had 
become  deaf.  Playing  with  her  were  two  little  girls  about  three  and  five 
years  of  age. 

"  All  of  my  deaf-mute  children  are  not  here  to-day,"  continued  the 
scientist,  as  he  caressed  a  little  head  that  was  resting  against  his  knee. 

"  These  two  little  girls  are  my  daughters.  They  are  both  able  to 
speak  and  hear  ;  but  for  the  present  I  am  going  to  have  them  with  this 
little  girl,  as  I  think  that  they  will  aid  her  in  acquiring  visible  speech: 
They  are  accustomed  to  talk  with  their  mother,  who  is  entirely  deaf,  and 
hence  the  movements  of  their  lips  are  very  distinct." 

"  Perhaps  I  can  give  you  some  idea  of  the  method  of  articulate  teach- 
ing," he  suggested,  as  he  crossed  to  the  opposite  side  of  the  room  and 
stood  in  front  of  a  white  polished  surface  which  served  as  a  black-board. 
Pointing  to  a  series  of  black  characters  that  resembled  in  their  general 
appearance  Chinese  words,  he  said  :  "  These  characters  are  a  modifica- 
tion of  the  phonetic  alphabet  invented  by  my  father.  The  lines  and 
curves  which  form  them  represent  the  shape  of  the  mouth  when  the 


S  Dr.  BeWs  Private  Experimental  School. 

■words  are  littered.  For  instance,  take  the  word  'Eun,'  which  is  repre- 
sented by  this  character.  Now,  that  is  formed  by  the  signs  phonetically 
representing  those  three  letters.  The  characters  are  taught  to  the  chil- 
dren, as  I  can  practically  demonstrate  to  you,"  and  he  paused,  and  turn- 
ing to  the  young  lady  teacher  who  was  standing  near  asked  if  the  children 
could  have  a  lesson. 

The  young  lady  thought  that  they  could,  but  just  then  the  children 
iad  begun  a  fine  game  of  hide  and  seek,  and  only  one  was  risible.  A 
murmur  of  laughter  revealed  the  hiding-place  of  another  from  behind  the 
■door ;  and,  finally,  the  little  deaf  girl  was  drawn  fi-om  beneath  the  win- 
dow-curtains, screaming  with  laughter,  and  all  the  rest  joined  in  her 
merriment. 

A  row  of  tiny  chairs  was  then  drawn  up  in  front  of  the  board,  and  the 
•children,  together  with  the  teacher,  formed  the  class.  The  inventor,  with 
a  pointer  in  his  hand,  and  his  kindly  face  winning  the  attention  of  the 
restless  little  ones,  stood  in  front  of  the  class,  and  the  singular  recitation 
began.  A  recitation  without  a  sound  being  uttered  is  like  a  river  without 
water,  but  this  was  the  kind  that  was  conducted.  Mr.  Bell  pointed  to 
one  of  the  characters  on  the  board,  at  the  same  time  moving  his  lips  as 
if  he  was  speaking  the  word.  The  first  character  represented  the  name 
of  a  child,  and  the  one  designated  readily  recognized  her  name  and  as- 
sumed an  attitude  of  attention.  ^  Then  the  pointfer  moved  along  to  another 
character,  and  the  little  girl  rose  to  her  feet.  Following  the  pointer  with 
her  eye,  and  then  watching  the  lips  of  her  instructor,  the  little  one  began 
to  walk  up  and  down,  then  ran,  and  finally  ran  to  the  door,  as  she  inter- 
preted the  visible  speech  from  the  lips  of  the  inventor.  In  this  way  the 
little  deaf  girl  was  told  to  do  a  number  of  things,  and  she  readily  com- 
prehended what  was  wanted. 

When  Mr.  Bell  turned  to  speak  to  the  visitor  the  little  ones  scampered 
away  again  to  their  play,  and  the  lesson  was  over. 

"After  this  school  has  fairly  started,"  he  remarked,  "I  don't  intend  to 
have  an  audible  word  spoken  in  the  school-room.  The  teacher  will  com- 
municate entirely  with  the  scholars  by  means  of  visible  speech.  Even 
when  they  wish  a  plaything  they  make  use  of  these  bits  of  card-board, 
which,  as  you  can  see,  contain  the  names  of  various  toys  and  objects. 
Here,  for  instance,  is  one  which  has  the  name  '  doll '  written  on  it.  The 
doll  itself  is  similarly  labeled,  and  the  child  by  comparing  the  two  soon 
becomes  familiar  with  the  written  word.  Then  when  they  see  it  on  the 
board  they  will  at  once  recognize  it." 

"Does  the  inability  to  speak  in  a  deaf-mute  mean  physical  inca- 
pacity ?  "  inquired  the  reporter,  branching  off  into  the  general  subject. 

"  Very  young  children,  who  are  hard  of  hearing  or  who  do  not  hear  at 
all,  do  not  naturally  speak,"  was  the  reply;  "  and  this  fact  has  given 
origin  to  the  term  '  deaf-mute,'  by  which  it  is  customary  to  designate  a 
person  who  is  deaf  from  childhood.  So  constant  is  the  association  of 
defective  speech  with  defective  hearing  in  childhood  that  if  one  of  your 
children,  whom  you  had  left  at  home  hearing  perfectly  and  talking  per- 
fectly, should,  from  some  accident,  lose  his  hearing,  he  would  also  nat- 
urally lose  his  speech.  This  is  so  true  that  even  a  slight  impairment  of 
hearing  is  accompanied  by  a  corresponding  imperfection  in  speech." 


Dr.  BelPs  Private  Experimental  School.  9 

"  Why  is  this  the  ease  ?  "  interrupted  the  listener. 

"  The  most  ingenious  and  fallacious  arguments  have  been  advanced  in 
explanation,"  was  the  reply.  "The  learned  Sibscota,  150  years  ago, 
argued  that  the  nerves  of  the  tongue  were  connected  with  the  nerves  of 
the  ear,  and  a  defect  in  one  caused  a  corresponding  defect  in  the  other. 
Even  now  the  majority  of  people  believe  that  deaf  children  are  dumb 
on  account  of  defective  vocal  organs.  But  why  should  children  speak  a. 
language  that  they  never  heard  ?  We  do  not,  and  no  one  would  argue 
that  our  vocal  organs  were  defective  because  we  do  not  speak  Chinese. 
It  is  a  fallacy.  The  vocal  organs  of  the  deaf  are  as  perfect  as  our 
own." 

"Why,  then,  do  they  not  speak  ?  "  asked  the  reporter. 

' '  There  is  no  reason  why  they  may  not  all  be  taught  to  speak  save 
our  ignorance  of  the  mechanism  of  speech.  The  difficulties  in  the  way 
of  teaching  them  articulation  lie  with  us.  Speech  is  the  mechanical  re- 
sult of  certain  adjustments  of  the  vocal  organs,  and  if  we  can  explain 
to  the  deaf  children  the  correct  adjustment  of  the  particular  organs 
they  possess,  they  will  speak.  The  difficulty  lies  with  us.  We  learn  to 
speak  by  imitating  the  sounds  we  hear  in  titter  ignorance  of  the  organic 
action  that  accompanies  the  sound." 

"  There  has  been  one  fallacy  which  has  greatly  impeded  progress  in 
the  education  of  the  deaf,"  continued  Mr.  Bell,  "and  that  is  the  idea  that 
thei'e  could  be  no  reason  without  speech.  It  is  difficult  for  us  to  realize 
the  possibility  of  a  train  of  thought  being  carried  on  without  words. 
The  old  theory  was  that  if  a  deaf-mute  was  to  be  taught  to  think,  he 
must  first  be  taught  to  speak,  and  attempts  were  made  to  do  this  by  imi- 
tating the  miracles  of  Christ.  As  you  saw  in  the  case  of  the  little  girl,  if 
a  child  possessed  of  its  hearing  and  speech  should  suddenly  become  deaf, 
little  by  little  the  mother  tongue  is  forgotten,  and  the  child  becomes  a 
deaf-mute.  Experience  has  shown  that  the  speech  is  very  readily  re- 
stored by  causing  the  child  to  observe  the  movement  of  our  own  vocal 
organs. 

"But  here,  again,"  continued  Mr.  Bell,  thoughtfully,  "a  new  fallacy 
has  arisen,  namely,  that  speech  is  as  clearly  visible  to  the  eye  as  it  is  au- 
dible to  the  ear.  When  we  come  to  examine  the  visibility  of  the  elemen- 
tary sounds  of  our  language,  we  shall  find  that  the  majority  are  not 
clearly  visible  to  the  eye.  When  the  lips  are  closed  we  cannot  see  what 
is  going  on  inside  the  mouth.  For  instance,  the  sounds  represented  by 
the  letters  p,  b,  m,  involve  a  closure  of  the  lips,  but  while  it  is  impossi- 
ble for  a  child  to  say  definitely  whether  the  sound  you  utter  is  p,  b,  or 
m,  he  knows  it  is  one  of  these  three,  for  no  other  sounds  involve  a 
closure  of  the  lips.  So  with  words.  He  may  not  be  able  to  tell  the  pre- 
cise word  that  you  utter,  but  it  is  possible  for  him  to  refer  it  to  a  group 
of  words  presenting  the  same  appearance  to  the  eye.  For  instance,  the 
words  '  pat,'  '  bat,'  and  '  mat '  have  the  same  appearance  to  the  eye,  but 
the  deaf  person  can  readily  distinguish  which  is  meant  by  the  context. 
As,  for  example,  were  you  to  say  that  you  had  wiped  your  feet  upon  a 
mat,  it  could  not  be  pat  or  bat. 

"  Context  is,  therefore,  the  real  key  to  the  art  of  understanding  speech 
by  the  eye,"  said  Mr.  Bell,  with  emphasis.     "  But  this  involves,  as  a  pre- 


10  i)r-  BdVs  Priivrle  Kxpenmental  School. 

requisite,  a  vernacular  knowledge  of  tLe  language.  In  eases  where  con- 
genitally  deaf  children  have  acquired  the  art  of  reading  speech  by  the 
■eye  as  perfectly  as  those  who  have  become  deaf  from  disease,  it  is  found 
that  they  have  first  acquired  a  vernacular  knowledge  of  the  language,  at 
least  in  its  written  form.  It  is  a  curious  fact,  also,  that  long  words  are 
more  visible  than  short  words.  The  gesture  language  is  used  as  vernacu- 
lar  in  our  modern  institutions,  and  this  prevents  the  acquiring  of  English 
as  a  vernacular,  and  also  causes  the  deaf  to  associate  together  in  adult 
life.  The  gesture  language  is  an  artificial  and  conventional  language 
quite  different  from  English." 

"You  propose,  then,  to   teach  one  language,"  suggested  the  listener. 

"  There  is  no  reason  that  I  can  see  for  teaching  a  person,  because  he 
happens  to  be  deaf,  a  foreign  language,"  was  the  prompt  reply.  "  By 
associating  the  deaf  children  with  the  hearing  children  as  far  as  possible, 
they  will  acquire  the  more  rapidly  the  power  of  communicating  with 
them.  If  they  have  a  language  of  their  own,  they  are  bound  to  asso- 
ciate together  in  adult  life,  and  the  consequence  is  they  intermarry  and 
their  affliction  is  transmitted  to  their  offspring,  so  that  statistics  to-day 
actually  show  that  the  deaf-mutes  are  increasing  in  number. 

"  In  regard  to  the  education  of  the  deaf  in  this  way,"  he  continued, 
"  the  system  is  not  an  untried  one.  In  1878  I  organized  a  day-school  in 
the  city  of  Greenock,  Scotland,  and  occupied  a  room  in  the  academy 
there,  which  contained,  I  should  think,  upward  of  200  hearing  children. 
In  this  room  the  deaf  children  were  taught  by  a  sjjecial  articulation 
teacher,  sent  from  .\merica.  They  were  caused  to  associate  with  the 
hearing  children  in  the  academy  in  every  way  possible.  They  played 
with  them  in  the  playground,  and  joined  them  for  instruction  in  such 
subjects  as  writing,  drawing,  sewing,  etc.  The  success  of  this  school 
has  been  so  great  that  the  board  of  education  has  recently  adopted  it  as 
a  permanency,  throwing  it  open  to  all  the  deaf  children  of  Greenock  and 
the  surrounding  towns.  I  visited  the  school  about  a  year  ago  and  found 
that  all  the  deaf  pupils  had  formed  many  friends  among  the  hearing 
pupils  of  the  academy,  with  whom  they  conversed  quite  freely  by  word 
of  mouth.  Their  vernacular  use  of  the  English  language  was  quite  re- 
markable, especially  when  we  consider  that  they  were  either  born  deaf 
or  had  lost  their  hearing  in  infancy. 

•'  The  mother  talks  to  the  child  in  whole  sentences,  and  the  child  under- 
stands what  is  said  long  before  it  can  speak.  That  is  what  I  am  doing 
with  these  little  children.  I  talk  to  them  all  sorts  of  nonsense  on  the 
l&gt;oard,  just  such  as  you  hear  in  the  nursery.  Well,  the  hearing  child,  in 
his  first  efforts  to  speak,  tries  to  remember  these  sounds,  and,  finally,  he 
■i^ucceeils,  but  at  first  imperfectly,  and  this  period  of  imperfect  speech 
continues  for  a  long  time.  The  hearing  child  uses  his  ears ;  in  my 
school  the  deaf  child  will  use  his  eyes.  That  is  all  the  difference.  After 
I  have  established  communication  with  the  child,  then  I  will  write  the 
characters  representing  the  sound  of  the  words  on  the  board.  I  will 
speak  the  words.  Then, the  child  sees  the  form  of  the  sound  just  as  the 
other  child  hears  it,  and  tries  to  imitate  it.  The  imitation  is  imperfect. 
Then,  as  the  mother  repeats  words,  and  the  child,  after  long  practice, 
attains  the  correct  pronunciation,  so  will  I  write  on  the  board  the  form 


iJr.  BeWs  Private  Experimental  School.  11 

of  the  sound  of  the  word  as  incorrectly  pronounced  by  the  child,  and 
then  the  correct  form.  The  child's  eye  sees  the  difference  between  the 
false  and  the  true  sound  and  tries  to  attain  the  latter.  He  succeeds  Just 
as  truly  as  a  baby's  prattle  is  changed  by  constant  practice  into  the  cor- 
rect forms  of  English  speech." 

The  daily  journals  of  this  School,  kept  with  rare  analytic 
exactness,  are  intensely  interesting  and  instructive  to  the  stu- 
dent of  pedagogy,  as  would  also  be  the  work  in  line-writing 
and  visible  speech  of  each  pupil ;  all  of  which  has  been  care- 
fully preserved  and  deposited  for  safe-keeping  in  the  Volta 
Bureau.  At  the  close  of  the  first  year's  existence  of  the 
School,  the  teacher,  Miss  Hitz,  summed  up  the  results,  in  part, 
in  a  paper  read  before  the  Third  Convention  of  Articulation 
Teachers  in  New  York,  June  25-28,  1884,  from  which  the 
following  extracts  are  culled  : 

As  one's  daily  surroundings  have  so  much  to  do  in  moulding  effects  and 
producing  results,  it  seems  suitfible  that  I  should  say  a  few  words  about 
our  school-rooms.  They  had  morning  and  afternoon  sunshine.  There 
was  a  large  bow-window,  with  a  cozy  seat  running  around  its  curve. 
This  window  overlooked  a  garden  which,  in  the  spring,  burst  into  a 
wonder  of  bright  colors  and  sweet  smells.  It  will  always  be  a  pleasure 
to  recall  the  memory  of  those  rooms,  with  the  air  of  the  nursery  and  a 
touch  of  home  ;  the  walls,  with  their  pictures  of  happy  children  ;  the 
open  fire-place,  the  pretty  little  chairs  and  tables,  the  curtained  shelves 
full  of  kindergarten  materials,  the  other  toys,  the  horse  with  real  hair, 
the  steam-cars,  the  beautiful  doll  with  her  own  chair  and  crib  and  trunk 
full  of  clothes.  We  had  a  museum  of  common  things — a  collection  of  as 
many  every-day,  ordinary  things  as  we  thought  of.  These  were  put  into 
bottles  and  labelled  on  one  side  in  line-writing,  and  on  the  other  side  of 
the  bottle  in  script. 

We  had  large  white-boards.  They  were  thick  plates  of  ground  glass, 
backed  by  white  cotton  cloth,  the  whole  being  simply  and  tastefully 
framed.  These  boards  were  jointly  invented  by  Prof.  Bell  and  myself. 
We  were  able  to  use  charcoal  instead  of  chalk,  which  is  certainly  more 
healthful  and  agreeable  for  such  constant  use.  The  benefit  to  the  eyes, 
thus  obtained  by  black  on  white  instead  of  white  on  black,  or,  as  it  gen- 
erally becomes,  white  on  gray,  is  acknowledged  by  the  best  oculists  and 
educators.  I  must  not  omit  to  state  that  white-boards,  when  compared 
to  black-boards,  have  a  very  great  cesthetic  value,  as  they  give  clean, 
light,  cheerful  effects  to  the  room. 

The  chief  object  of  this  school  has  been  the  development  of  speech. 
Therefore,  all  kindergarten  methods  have  been  made  subservient  to  that 
end.  We  have  had  kindergarten  principles  in  our  play,  in  our  school 
government,  and  in  our  general  work. 

In  the  pleasant  little  house  which  we  occupied  there  was  a  regular 
kindergarten  for  hearing  children  on  the  first  floor,  while  we  had  our 
special  school  for  deaf  children  on  the  second  floor.     The  deaf  children

went  down-stairs  for  all  the  kindergarten  games  and  for  most  of  ths 
kindergarten  occupations.  This  plan  has  worked  so  admirably  in  giving 
a  thoroughly  natural  companionship  among  hearing  children  that  it 
must  be  acknowledged  as  a  very  great  success. 

At  first  the  deaf  children  were  shy  about  taking  prominent  parts  in 
the  games,  but  even  on  the  first  day  my  journal  tells  us  that  a  little  boy, 
congecitally  deaf,  "  entered  with  real  enjoyment  into  the  spirit  of  the 
kindergarten  games  with  the  hearing  children,  and  actually  tried  to 
sing  !  "  Gradually,  as  our  stock  of  words  increased,  some  of  the  games 
were  intelligently  explained  and  understood,  and  now  these  little  deaf 
children  enter  so  heartily  into  the  pretty  games  that,  when  visitors  come, 
I  have  frequently  been  asked  the  convincing  question,  "  Which  are  the 
deaf  children  ?  " 

The  hearing  children  and  the  deaf  children,  thus  thrown  together  in 
their  daily  interests  and  enthusiasms,  have  learned  to  feel  a  genuine 
sense  of  companionship.  These  little  ones  have  proved  that  in  the  free, 
generous,  loving  fellowship  of  childhood  all  difficulties  are  surmounted, 
all  differences  are  forgotten.  In  their  spontaneous,  happy  way  these 
little  hearing  children  have  talked  to  the  little  deaf  children,  and  the 
deaf  children  have  understood  enough  to  make  them  want  to  understand 
still  more,  and — to  talk  also  ! 

In  our  special  work  upstairs,  we  began  by  playing,  and  have  been 
playing  ever  since,  as  much  and  as  hard  as  we  could.  At  first,  every- 
thing was  labelled — the  doors,  the  walls,  the  windows,  the  tables,  the 
chairs,  and  the  playthings.  In  order  to  give  the  children  the  idea  that 
these  pictures,  or  written  words,  were  the  names  of  the  objects  upon 
which  they  were  pasted,  we  established  what  we  called  "  the  shop-sys- 
tem." We  had  racks  filled  with  cards.  On  these  cards  were  written  the 
names  of  the  objects.  When  the  horse  was  wanted,  we  would  lead  the 
horse  to  the  card-rack  and  hunt  the  card  which  bore  the  same  word- 
picture  as  the  label  on  the  horse.  Having  found  it,  I  would  speak  the 
word  horse,  place  the  child's  hand  at  my  throat,  and  after  the  child  had 
made  an  effort  to  reproduce  the  word  in  speech,  the  card  was  handed  to 
me,  and  the  child  received  the  horse.  In  these  first  days,  it  was  not  so 
much  wlmt  was  said,  nor  Turn  it  was  said,  that  we  felt  to  be  of  impor- 
tance. Our  chief  aim  was  to  establish  the  idea  of  speech.  By  and  by, 
as  the  words  became  familiar,  we  did  not  need  the  cards  with  their  writ- 
ten symbols.  But,  instead  of  hunting  a  card,  the  children  come  to  me 
directly  and  speak  the  words. 

In  the  beginning,  we  talked  and  wrote  to  the  children  constantly,  say- 
ing anything  and  everything,  and  having  them  try  to  speak  only  the  im- 
portant words  or  nouns,  the  names  of  their  playthings,  just  as  we  natu- 
rally do  with  hearing  children  who  are  learning  to  talk.  We  introduced 
active  verbs  almost  immediately,  by  simple  class-exercises.  As  fast  as 
new  words  were  suggested  and  known,  they  were  combined  into  sen- 
tences, and,  after  a  sufficient  drill  in  class-exercises,  these  sentences 
were  transferred  to  the  reading-book.     *    *     * 

One  of  the  pleasantest  and  most  interesting  exercises  has  been  our 
"lunch."  We  had  a  set  of  doll's  dishes,  tiny  glasses,  forks,  spoons, 
knives,  napkins,  etc.,  to  match.     Sometimes  the  table  was  set  by  regular 


Dr.  BelVs  Private  Experimental  School.  13 

command  ;  that  is,  the  order  was  written  on  the  board  and  then  read  or 
spoken.  It  is  a  well-established  fact  that  all  children  like  to  eat.  It  is 
a  logical  consequence  that  children  are  very  sure  to  ask,  in  some  way,  for 
what  they  want  to  eat.  As  our  school  was  essentially  a  speech-school, 
it  was  necessary  that  the  children  should  have  some  definite  way  of  find- 
ing out  the  names  of  things.  So  we  had  the  names  of  all  the  articles  of 
food  written  on  tiny  cards  and  stuck  into  the  articles  themselves.  Each 
child  had  a  little  box  full  of  similar  cards  at  the  side  of  his  plate.  When 
he  wanted  any  special  thing,  he  would  hunt  up  a  card  in  his  pile,  and 
match  the  name  of  the  article  desired.  Then  showing  it  to  me,  I  would 
give  the  child  the  spoken  form  of  the  word  and  he  would  repeat  it. 
Gradually  the  cards  were  left  aside.  The  little  girl,  who  had  once  heard, 
began  to  speak  in  full  and  rounded  sentences,  aud  the  little  boy  would 
ask  for  what  he  wanted  by  words  instead  of  signs.  The  sentences  were 
naturally  limited,  but  among  those  which  were  frequently  used  at 
our  table  I  could  always  be  sure  that  both  children  would  understand 
whatever  I  might  ask  them.  This  lunch-exercise  has  afforded  opportu- 
nities for  a  little  training  in  table  manners,  and  has  certainly  been  a  real 
incentive  to  speech  and  speech-reading. 

We  have  learned  that  deaf  children  do  not  use  signs  if  they  can  have 
words. 

We  have  learned  that  the  kindergarten  should  be  studied  and  used  in 
the  home. 

We  have  learned  that  departments  for  deaf  children  should  be  estab- 
lished in  connection  with  free  kindergartens. 

We  believe  a  new  world  lies  before  the  deaf  child.  Language  is  to  be 
developed  naturally.  A  great  command  is  to  be  gained.  The  kindergar- 
ten is  a  means  for  this  end.  It  develops  mind  and  heart  and  the  child's 
whole  being.  It  brings  him  in  harmony  with  outward  nature.  Let  us 
be  ready  to  offer  the  little  child  a  natural  way  to  express  his  full,  eager, 
young  life.  Oh,  it  is  a  great  and  glorious  work  !  What  is  the  natural 
way  ?  Does  not  every  mother-heart  know  ?  Does  not  every  one  who 
has  felt  the  beauty  of  child-life  know  ?  Can  we  wait  until  the  school 
age  ?  For  what  was  this  sweet,  eager,  impressionable  time  of  infancy 
and  youngest  childhood  given  ?  Is  it  not  especially  for  the  general  de- 
velopment of  body  and  mind  and  heart  ?  Is  it  not  especially  for  the 
development  of  speech  ?  Ought  we  to  wait  f  How  can  we  allow  these 
little  spirits  to  be  imprisoned  by  our  neglect  of  human  nature's  most 
natural  time  for  spontaneous  speech  ?  Are  we  not  overlooking  one  of 
God's  best  opportunities? 

Miss  Hitz,  having  La  the  meantime  married,  resigned,  and 
was  succeeded  by  Miss  S.  E.  Littlefield,  of  East  Boston,  Mas- 
sachusetts, from  whose  report,  at  the  close  of  the  second  year, 
I  make  the  following  extracts : 

The  second  year  of  the  School  opened  the  first  day  of  October,  1884, 
with  four  pupils — F.  B.,  who  was  eight  years  old;  G.  H.,  five;  P.  K. , 
four  and  a  half,  and  S.  K.,  P.  K.'s  sister,  three  ;  all  of  them  born  deaf. 

G.  H.  was  in  the  School  during  its  first  year  and  had  made  progress

enough  to  furnish  a  foundation  for  future  work.  He  could  speak  many 
words  distinctly,  and  remembered  well  the  exercises  he  had  learned  the 
first  year,  reading  readily  such  sentences  as  "  Walk  to  the  door,"  and 
showing  his  comprehension  of  the  meaning  by  immediately  following 
the  direction. 

He  had  traced  throiagh  tracing-paper,  but  had  no  inclination  to  write 
by  himself  either  on  the  board  or  on  paper. 

The  only  steady  instruction  F.  B.  had  received  was  during  the  spring, 
before  he  entered  school,  when  for  a  few  weeks  he  received  special  at- 
tention ;  yet  he  had  a  vocabulary  of  eighty  words,  learned  at  different 
times,  all  of  which  he  recognized  when  written,  and  some  of  which  he 


MISS   B.   E.    LITTLEFIELD. 


spoke,  understanding  them  also  when  spoken  by  others.  He  had  tried 
to  write.  Three  o's,  a  top  to  the  first  connecting  lines  to  the  second,  and 
a  loop  to  the  third,  was  dog.  He  seemed  so  nearly  equal  to  G.  H.  in  his 
acquirements,  I  put  them  into  one  class  and  found  they  worked  well  and 
enjoyed  working  together.     They  formed  the  senior  class. 

P.  K.,  when  entering  school,  knew  a  hundred  words  and  a  number  of 
sentences.  His  father  had  taught  him  principally  by  means  of  labels. 
The  names  of  the  objects  were  also  put  on  a  card,  eight  by  twelve  inches, 
in  printed  capitals  at  first ;  afterward  the  script  form  was  found  to  serve 
as  well.     When  one  card  had  been  filled,  another  was  taken. 

S.  K.  was  a  beginner,  three  years  of  age  ;  her  only  accomplishment  the 
power  of  imitation.     This,  however,  was  of  use  to  her  ;  for,  by  imitating 


Dr.  BeWs  Private  Expe I  hnental  School.  15 

the   others,  she   gradually  learned  the   meaning  of  mvich   that  she  saw 
written. 

Two  weeks  after  the  opening  of  school  G.  0.  returned.  She  had  been 
with  G.  H.  the  previous  year  ;  could  talk  well  (had  lost  hearing  suddenly 
■at  the  age  of  five),  but  could  not  understand  speech  readily.  She  was 
with  us  only  until  Christmas,  when  she  left  to  go  to  Indiana  with  her 
mother,  remaining  away  all  winter. 

In  December,  W.  L.,  a  little  boy  nearly  five,  joined  the  class,  complet- 
ing the  number.  He  had  lost  hearing  when  beginning  to  talk.  For 
some  time  he  was  very  shy,  and  I  had  to  wait  until  he  became  accustomed 
to  the  place  and  the  people  before  making  a  beginning. 

For  a  few  weeks  we  had  our  full  number,  six,  which  made  a  large  class, 
-each  one  required  so  much  individual  attention. 

The  first  days  of  the  term  were  very  hot,  and  but  little  was  done  in 
the  way  of  work.  One  hour  was  spent  with  a  kindergarten  class  in  games 
and  occupation;  the  rest  of  the  time  was  spent  chiefly  in  making  ac- 
■quaiutance  with  the  various  toys  in  the  school-room. 

That  they  might  have  an  exercise  in  which  all  could  take  part  together, 
I  wrote  the  words  Stand,  Sit,  Walk,  Eun,  on  the  board.  This  was  tried 
-evei'y  day,  with  something  added  each  time.  They  enjoyed  the  exercise 
because  it  kept  them  in  motion. 

In  our  plan  of  school- work  it  was  arranged  that  communication  with 
the  children  should  be  by  means  of  line-writing  the  first  part  of  the  day, 
-and  by  Roman  letters  (common  script)  after  the  intermission.  As  the 
pupils  were  expected  to  copy  somp  of  the  exercises  from  the  board,  a 
knowledge  of  writing  was  necessary.  It  was  easy  to  copy  line-writing,  . 
the  characters  being  simple  lines.  All  the  writing  was  on  paper  ;  at  the 
■end  of  each  session  the  papers  were  stamped  with  a  date  and  carefully 
put  away. 

At  the  end  of  the  first  hour,  while  the  seniors  were  having  a  kindergar- 
ten game  down-stairs,  the  other  children  had  occasional  exercises  with  a 
hand-mirror,  when  they  seemed  to  be  "making  faces."  The  object  was  to 
teach  them  how  to  use  their  tongue.  They  learned  with  mirrors  to  imi- 
tate positions  of  the  mouth. 

When  the  others  returned  they  all  took  part  in  an  exercise  together, 
such  as  was  begun  the  first  day.  "  Walk  to  the  door,"  "  Stand  by  the  fire," 
"  ilunto  the  window,"  "Sit  on  the  floor,"  "  Touch,"  with  the  names  of  the 
■different  pupils  following,  and  many  other  sentences  were  taught  in  this 
way.  After  speaking  a  sentence,  I  would  point  to  it  on  the  board,  and 
if  it  was  something  new,  do  it  first  myself.  After  once  showing,  they 
usually  remembered,  for  the  same  exercise  was  given -with  slight  varia- 
tions until  the  words  became  familiar. 

Our  class  exercise  was  followed  by  a  kindergarten  occupation  with  the 
■class  down-stairs.  When  it  was  time  to  go  I  pointed  to  the  board,  where 
"  Go  down-stairs"  was  written,  at  the  same  time  speaking  the  sentence. 
This  occupation  was  one  of  the  chief  pleasures  of  the  day.  They  learned 
to  build  with  blocks,  wove  little  mats  of  colored. papej-s,  sewed  colored 
■crewels  into  eard-board,  moulded  with  clay,  folded  squares  of  tinted  paper 
into  different  shapes,  and  built  cubes  and  other  figures  with  sticks  and 
peas.     At  first  they  required  much  assistance,  but  gradually  did  with

less.  As  soon  as  they  knew  how,  they  were  encouraged  to  do  the  work 
themselves,  aud  they  took  pleasure  in  doing  it  well. 

From  11.30  to  12.30  there  was  an  intermission,  during  which  the  chil- 
dren took  lunch  and  played  under  the  supervision  of  the  kindergarten 
teacher,  thus  giving  their  own  teacher  an  opportunity  to  attend  the  par- 
ents' class,  which  met  at  that  hour,  beginning  the  9th  of  October  and 
lasting  through  the  year. 

In  that  class  theories  were  discussed,  experiments  tried,  tests  made. 

Instruction  began  with  a  study  of  the  mechanism  of  speech,  including 
the  anatomy  of  the  vocal  organs.  After  gaining  a  knowledge  of  visible 
speech,  attention  was  turned  to  line-writing,  a  shorthand  of  visible 
speech,  which  was  the  principal  means  of  communication  in  the  school- 
room. In  a  few  months  line- writing  became  so  familiar  that  some  mem- 
bers of  the  class  could  write  it  faster  than  they  could  ordinary  script. 
To  the  pupils  it  was  as  speech  to  hearing  children.  The  seniors  now 
read  it  as  fast  as  it  is  written  without  waiting  for  the  paper  to  be  turned 
toward  them — even  upside  down. 

When,  in  November,  the  subject  of  a  manual  alphabet  was  discussed, 
some  of  the  parents'  class  were  opposed  to  it ;  some  thought  it  would 
help  the  pupil  to  gain  a  clear  knowledge  of  written  language.  It  was 
necessary  to  have  one  that  would  not  require  the  constant  use  of  the 
eyes  and  so  interfere  with  speech-reading.  Mr.  Bell  told  his  experience 
with  a  glove  alphabet,  a  modification  of  Dalgarno's,  which  he  had  suc- 
cessfully tried,  and  the  class  immediately  began  learning  it,  wearing  on 
the  left  hand  a  glove  on  which  were  marked  the  letters  of  the  alphabet. 
After  becoming  familiar  with  the  positions,  the  glove  was  discarded. 
After  some  practice  this  alphabet  can  be  read  by  the  sense  of  touch.  One 
can  talk  to  a  child  while  spelling  on  his  hand,  thus  addressing  two  senses 
at  the  same  time. 

Previous  to  opening  the  Scliool  for  the  third  year,  Miss  Lit- 
tlefield  resigned,  having  been  called  home  by  the  illness  of  a 
near  relative. 

Dr.  Bell  just  at  that  time  was  deeply  engrossed  in  aifairs 
connected  with  the  memorable  telephone  litigation,  in  which 
his  character  was  ruthlessly  assailed.  His  time  and  attention 
were  imperatively  demanded  in  another  direction  than  the  af- 
fairs of  his  private  school. 

The  matter  of  selecting  for  the  third  time  a  qualified  teacher 
to  be  placed  in  charge  could  not  be  given  the  requisite  con- 
sideration, and  rather  than  continue  the  School  with  inadequate 
assistance,  debarred  as  he  was  from  giving  it  his  personal  at- 
tention, he  finally,  greatly  to  his  regret,  concluded  to  withdraw 
altogether,  and  in  October,  1885,  the  members  of  his  late 
parents'  and  students'  classes  essayed  to  continue  the  School 
on  their  own  responsibility.  To  this  end  the  following  assign- 
ment was  effected :

This  arrangement,  however,  after  a  brief  trial,  -was  discon- 
tinued, and  the  School  definitely  closed. 

As  already  stated,  the  School  was  organized  more  especially 
for  experimental  purposes,  and  during  its  brief  existence  gave

encouraging  evidence  to  those  interested  that  its  underlying 
principles  were  correct,  and  that  the  methods  pursued  in  the 
instruction  of  the  deaf,  if  conscientiously  adhered  to,  would 
accomplish  all  that  the  founder  claimed  for  them.  That  the 
School  could  not  be  continued  under  the  immediate  supervis- 
ion of  its  founder  was  a  misfortune  rather  than  his  fault  or 
the  fault  of  the  principles  which  it  aimed  to  embody  and  illus- 
trate. 

These  were  set  forth  clearly  in  a  letter,  on  record  in  the  jour- 
nal of  the  School,  written  by  Dr.  Bell  in  response  to  an  inquuy 
of  one  of  his  adult  pupils,  of  which  the  following  is  an  extract : 

The  necessary  prelimiimri/  to  good  speech  is  that  the  pupil  should  have 
a  definite  conception  of  how  we  pronounce  our  words ;  that  he  should 
have  in  his  mind  a  definite  model  which  he  attempts  to  copy.     With  this

model  in  the  mind,  the  defects  of  his  speech  will  be  due  not  to  defective 
aim,  but  to  defective  exeeiition,  arising  from  lack  of  control  of  the  organs- 
of  speech  (to  be  corrected  by  showing  him  what  he  said). 

Learning  to  speak  is  like  learning  to  shoot.  (1)  The  learner  must 
clearly  perceive  the  bull's-eye  on  the  target  befoi'e  he  can  take  aim.  (2) 
He  must  also  see  where  7m  bullet  struck  when  he  shot  wide  of  his  mark. 
The  first  and  prime  necessity  is  that  he  should  clearly  perceive  the  defi- 
nite point  on  the  target  at  which  he  is  to  aim.  It  is  evident  that,  if  the 
target  should  be  permanently  obscured  by  fog,  he  could  never  become  a. 
good  marksman,  however  much  he  might  try.  Now,  apply  this  to  the 
case  of  F.  and  G.  Their  speech  is  defective — they  are  poor  marksmen. 
What  are  we  to  do  to  remedy  the  defects  and  improve  the  speech?  The 
first  question  that  arises  is  :  "What  are  the  causes  of  the  defects  ?  Are  they 
due  to  defective  ai'TO,  to  defective  execution,  or  to  both  causes?     *    *    * 

Now,  it  is  evident  that,  before  they  can  even  attempt  to  give  the  correct 
pronunciation,  they  must  have  some  definite  idea  as  to  what  that  correct 
pronunciation  .is.  *  *  *  No  amount  of  drill  on  elementary  sounds, 
etc.,  will  be  of  avail  to  produce  good  pronunciation  if  the  model  does  not 
remain  in  the  memory.  The  elements  may  all  be  perfectly  acquired,  and 
yet  the  speech  will  be  imperfect  and  vague.  We  can  see  that  in  the  case 
of  a  semi-mute.  In  such  a  case  the  ability  to  pronounce  correctly  is  present, 
but  the  "what  to  pronounce"  is  only  vaguely  perceived. 

The  thing  of  most  immediate  importance  in  improving  the  speech  is 
to  impress  the  model  upon  the  mind.  The  experience  of  last  winter  shows 
that  it  is  not  only  necessary  to  present  the  pronunciation  clearly  and 
unambiguously,  but  pupils  must  be  led  to  copy  that  pronunciation 
clearly  and  unambiguously  from  memory  for  us.  This  memorizing  of  the 
model  pronunciation  is,  to  my  mind,  the  first  and  most  important  step. 
*     *     * 

The  only  way  we  can  be  sure  that  the  model  pronunciation  has  been 
memorized  is  by  a  resort  to  manual  reproduction.  Pupils  should  write 
or  spell  the  pronunciation. 

Our  utmost  efforts  on  articulation  alone  will,  I  firmly  believe,  be  insuffi- 
cient to  accomplish  the  result  if  the  conception  of  the  correct  pronuncia- 
tion does  not  remain  constantly  in  the  memory.  Hence  I  believe  that 
articulation  should  be  secondary  and  the  conception  of  articulation  be 
made  predominant.  To  attempt  the  constant  and  habitual  correction  of 
the  pronunciation  before  the  child's  mind  is  familiar  with  the  picture  of 
the  pronunciation  will,  I  am  sure,  result  in  the  usual  unpleasant  nagging 
process  with  which  we  are  only  too  familiar  in  articulation  schools.  Let 
our  main  efforts  be  expended,  for  the  present,  in  getting  our  pupils  to 
memorize  the  picture  of  the  pronunciation  of  the  words  and  sentences 
they  understand  when  written  and  spoken,  and  we  will  substitute  a 
power  of  inward  self-correction  for  correction  constantly  applied  only  by 
pressure  from  without.  When  we  know  that  the  picture  is  fixed  in  the 
mind,  then  pressure  from  outside  can  be  gently  applied  to  cause  the 
pupil  to  attempt  to  copy  correctly  with  the  mouth  the  model  that  is  in 
his  memory.  Till  that  model  exists  in  the  mind,  the  correction  of  his 
speech  cannot,  I  am  sure,  be  accomplished  by  our  efforts  alone.  Is  not 
speech-reading  of  importance  as  well  as  speech?    And  what  istheneees- 


20  Df-  BeWs  Private  Experimental  School. 

sary  preliminary  to  speech-readiag  ?  The  prerequisite  without  which  good 
speech-reading  is  an  impossibility 't  Is  it  not  sufficient  familiarity  with 
the  English  language  to  enable  the  pupil  to  distinguish  ambiguous  words 
by  context?  If  I  am  right,  does  it  not  follow  that  good  speech-reading  is 
:i  result  and  not  a  cause  of  familiarity  with  the  English  language  ?  Hence 
the  English  language  in  a  clear,  unambiguous  form  comes  first. 

Again,  we  come  to  writing  and  spelling  as  a  means  to  good  speech  and 
speech-reading.  A  clear,  definite  picture  of  spoken  language  existing  in 
the  mind  must  aid  speech-reading.  Familiarity  with  written  speech,  to 
my  mind,  comes  before  spoken  speech  and  speech-reading,  and  becomes 
a  cause  of  both.     *     *     * 

I  cannot  too  strongly  insist  on  the  truth  of  the  proposition  that  speech- 
reading  is  a  result,  and  not  a  cause,  of  familiarity  with  the  English  lan- 

gUilgf . 

The  immediate  reasons  which  actuated  Dr.  Bell  in  finally 
closing  the  School  altogether  are  stated  in  the  following  mem- 
oranda entered  upon  its  journal : 

I  felt  convinced  of  the  necessity  of  this  school  being  in  the  hands  of 
an  experienced  teacher ;  I  could  not  be  responsible  for  the  progress  of 
pupils  under  amateur  teachers,  unless  an  experienced  teacher  was  asso- 
ciated, or  unless  I  could  personally  be  in  constant  attendance.  The  bitter 
attacks  made  against  my  personal  honor  in  telephone  lawsuits  compelled 
me,  much  against  my  will,  to  devote  a  large  portion  of  my  time  to  the 
evidence  in  such  cases.  My  time  promised  to  be  so  fully  occupied  that 
I  could  only  hope  to  be  able  to  spend  a  short  time  occasionally  in  the 
school.  *  *  *  As  I  had  anticipated,  so  it  turned  out — my  time  was  too 
much  occupied  with  other  matters  to  allow  me  to  pay  more  than  an  occa- 
sional visit  to  the  class-rooms. 

The  pupils  occupied  the  building  during  the  remainder  of  the  school 
year  (1885-6),  and  then  I  gave  up  the  budding  and  grounds  ( which  were 
only  rented),  convinced  that  it  was  hopeless  for  me  to  carry  on  a  school 
that  would  be  satisfactory  to  me,  unless  I  could  obtain  an  experienced 
teacher  who  would  remain  permanently  in  charge.  My  first  teacher  mar- 
ried and  left  me  after  one  year.  My  second  teacher  was  compelled  to 
leave  me  on  account  of  the  death  of  her  mother.     *     *     * 

I  do  not  think  that  a  school  like  mine,  where  the  methods  of  instruction 
are  experimental,  can  be  a  success  unless  the  teacher  in  charge  remains 
permanently  for  several  years,  so  as  to  profit  by  the  results  of  our  experi- 
ments. *  *  *  I  mean  a  school  where  I  can  work  practically,  and 
develop  experimentally  new  and  better  methods  of  teaching  very  young 
deaf  children.  I  cannot  afford  to  devote  all  my  time,  and  do  not  think 
it  worth  while  to  reopen  the  school  unless  I  can  have  such  a  person  in 
charge.  (Signed)  A.  G.  B.

SUPPLEMENT 


The  Conventions  of  American  In- 
structors of  the  Deaf, 


1850-1893. 


By  the  editor. 


THE  CONVENTIONS  OF  AMERICAN  INSTRUCTORS 
OF  THE  DEAF. 

The  holding  of  Conventions  of  American  Instructors  of  the 
Deaf  was  first  suggested  by  Mr.  Luzerne  Rae,  the  first  editor 
of  the  American  Annals  of  the  Deaf,  in  the  Annals  for 
April,  1849.  Speaking  of  a  convention  of  German  Instructors 
held  in  1847  at  Pforzheim,  he  said  : 

Is  it  not  possible,  we  desire  to  ask,  for  the  American  teachers  of  the 
deaf  and  dumb  to  follow  this  example  of  their  German  brethren,  and 
come  together  occasionally  for  mutual  consultation  ?  The  great  dis- 
tances by  which  many  of  the  American  schools  are  separated  from  one 
another  is  an  obstacle,  certainly,  to  much  intercommunication,  but  yet 
it  is  not  insurmountable.  If  a  meeting  of  the  kind  suggested  should  be 
appointed  to  be  held  at  some  convenient  time  and  place  (let  us  say 
Philadelphia,  during  the  summer  vacations  of  1850),  we  are  rather  sure 
that  as  many  as  twenty-five  or  thirty  instructors  of  the  deaf  and  dumb 
could,  without  material  difficulty,  be  present,  and  we  are  very  confident 
that  they  would  not  meet  and  Separate  without  receiving  mutual  benefit 

It  has  long  seemed  to  us  that  the  education  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  was 
yet  in  comparative  infancy,  and  that  new  methods  would  sooner  or  later 
be  devised,  which  even  prejudice  must  receive  as  great  improvements 
upon  the  old.  In  respect,  especially,  to  the  acquisition  of  written  lan- 
guage—an acquisition  the  most  of  all  important  to  the  deaf-mute,  and 
yet  one  in  which  he  is  now  pre-eminently  deficient — it  has  seemed  to  us 
that  there  ijiiut  be  some  mode  of  instruction  still  hidden  in  the  future, 
superior  to  any  heretofore  employed.  We  know  of  no  better  method  to 
develop  and  bring  into  substantial  form  any  such  latent  possibility 
than  for  the  best  minds  among  the  instructors  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  to 
come  together  to  destroy  each  other's  errors  and  to  quicken  their  dili- 
gent search  after  a  "  more  excellent  way  "  than  any  in  which  they  have 
hitherto  travelled. 

On  the  23d  day  of  the  same  month  and  year  Dr.  Harvey  P. 
Peet,  Mr.  David  E.  Bartlett,  and  Mr.  J.  Addison  Cary,  of  the 
New  York  Institution,  acting  apparently  without  knowledge 
of  the  suggestion  made  by  Mr.  Rae,  addressed  a  circular  on 
the  same  subject  to  all  the  instructors  in  the  American  Insti- 
tutions. Favorable  responses  were  received,  and  a  convention 
was  called  to  meet  at  the  New  York  Institution  in  August  of 
that  year.  The  prevalence  of  cholera  that  summer  subse- 
quently rendered  it  necessary  to  postpone  the  meeting  until 
August  of  the  year  following,  1850,  when  the  First  Conven- 


4  The  Conventions  of  American  Instructors. 

tion  of  American  Instructors  of  the  Deaf  was  held  at  the  New 
York  Institution. 

The  first  Convention  was  found  so  profitable  that  it  was 
voted  to  have  another  in  the  following  year,  and  similar  meet- 
ings have  been  held  from  time  to  time  ever  since.  Until  1858 
the  Convention  met  at  irregular  intervals  of  one,  two,  and 
three  years  ;  then  they  were  interrupted  by  the  Civil  War,  and 
from  1858  to  1870  there  were  no  meetings ;  since  1870  they 
have  been  held  quadrennially.  The  places  and  times  of  meet- 
ing have  been  as  follows  : 

First  Convejition,  New  York,  August  28-30,  1850. 

Second  Convention,  Hartford,  Connecticut,  August  10-12,  1851. 

Third  Convention,  Columbus,  Ohio,  August  10-12,  1853. 

Fourth  Convention,  Staunton,  Virginia,  August  13-15,  1856. 

Fifth  Convention,  Jacksonville,  Illinois,  August  10-12,  1858. 

(Sixth  Convention.  The  Sixth  Convention,  which  was  to  have  met  in 
1861,  was  not  held,  on  account  of  the  Civil  "War.  When  the  Proceedings 
of  the  Convention  held  in  1870  were  published,  the  First  Conference  of 
American  Principals  and  Superintendents,  held  at  "Washington  in  1868, 
was  erroneously  reckoned  as  the  Sixth  Convention,  and  the  Convention 
of  1870  was  entitled  the  Seventh.  This  reckoning  has  been  continued  in 
the  titles  of  the  Conventions  held  since  that  time.) 

Seventh  Convention,  Indianapolis,  Indiana,  August  24-26,  1870. 

Eighth  Convention,  Belleville,  Ontario,  July  15-20,  1874. 

Ninth  Convention,  Columbus,  Ohio,  August  17-22,  1878. 

Tenth  Convention,  Jacksonville,  Illinois,  August  26-30,  1882. 

Eleventh  Convention,  Berkeley,  California,  July  15-22,  1886. 

Twelfth  Convention,  New  York,  August  23-27,  1890. 

In  the  First,  Second,  and  Fourth  Conventions  the  member- 
ship consisted  of  present  and  former  instructors,  trustees,  and 
directors  of  institutions,  and  State  officers  connected  with  the 
department  of  instruction,  all  admitted  on  equal  terms.  In 
the  Third  Convention  matrons  of  institutions,  and  some  other 
officers  of  the  Institution  where  the  Convention  was  held,  were 
added.  .  In  the  Fifth  Convention  the  wives  of  members  were 
included  with  the  classes  above  named.  In  the  Seventh  Con- 
vention instructors,  trustees,  directors,  and  their  wives  were 
active  members,  State  officers  being  made  honorary  members. 
In  the  Eighth  Convention  active  membership  was  limited  to 
instructors  engaged  in  the  work,  while  former  instructors  and 
other  persons  interested  were  invited  to  participate  in  the  pro- 
ceedings as  honorary  members.  The  same  is  true  of  all  the 
subsequent  Conventions,  except  that  clergymen  engaged  in 
mission  work  among  the  adult  deaf  have  been  admitted  to 
active  membership.

The  representation  of  schools  and  the  membership  in  the 
several  Conventions  have  been  as  follows :

Eleventh  Convention 43  144   110 

Twelfth   Convention 50  240   106 

The  proceedings  of  the  Conventions  have  alw^ays  been  inter- 
preted in  the  sign-language  for  the  benefit  of  the  deaf  per- 
sons present. 

The  members  of  the  Conventions  have  always  been  the 
guests  of  the  Institution  where  the  Convention  was  held. 
This  arrangement  has  enabled  them  to  become  well  acquainted 
with  one  another,  and  has  afforded  an  opportunity  for  the  in- 
formal interchange  of  views  and  the  formation  of  lasting 
friendships. 

A  stenographic  report  of  each  Convention  has  subsequently 
been  published  by  the  Institution  where  the  Convention  met, 
and  has  been  distributed  to  members  and  others  interested 
free  of  charge.  The  proceedings  have  consisted  chiefly  of  the 
reading  of  carefully  prepared  papers  relating  to  the  education 
of  the  deaf,  and  of  extemporaneous  discussions  upon  the 
topics  thus  presented,  and  other  appropriate  subjects.  Various 
resolutions  have  also  been  adopted,  though  resolutions  relat- 
ing to  matters  concerning  which  any  sharp  difference  of 
opinion  might  exist  have  rarely  been  introduced.  The  utmost 
liberty  of  expression  in  papers  and  discussions  has  always 
been  allowed  and  encouraged,  and,  while  differences  of  opinion 
have  been  freely  uttered,  the  proceedings  have  been  uniformly 
courteous  and  friendly. 

The  papers  presented  to  the  several. Conventions  have  been 
as  follows :  *

The  most  important  resolutions  passed  by  the  several  Con- 
ventions have  been  as  follows  : 

To  memorialize  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  asking  him  to  publish  a. 
list  of  the  deaf-mutes  in  the  United  States,  with  particulars  of  residence, 
age,  sex,  color,  occupation,  place  of  birth,  whether  able  to  read  and 
write  or  not,  etc.,  etc.,  J.  E.  Burnet,  i,  207,  259. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  it  is  inexpedient  to  receive  pupils  into  the 
institutions,  except  in  special  cases,  under  the  age  of  ten,  and  that 
twelve  would  be  a  more  suitable  age,  unless  it  would  interfere  with  the 
length  of  time  spent  in  school,  H.  P.  Peet,  i,  223. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  some  measures  should  be  devised  to  provide- 
for  the  instruction  and  moral  culture  of  deaf  children  before  their  ad- 
mission into  the  institutions,  L.  H.  Woodruff',  i,  225. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  the  mechanical  education  of  the  deaf  is 
second  in  importance  only  to  their  intellectual  and  moral  education,  and 
should  form  a  distinct  department  in  all  the  institutions,  W.  D.  Cooke, 
i,  225. 

Eecommending  each  instructor  to  keep  a  journal  of  school  exercises, 
and  a  record  of  observations  respecting  the  physical,  mental,  and  moral 
condition  of  his  pupils,  J.  A.  Oary,  i,  256. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  the  time  allotted  to  the  course  of  instrae-

Report  of  Committee,  S.  Porter,  iii,  85.

Appointing  a  committee  to  consider  the  subject  of  the  organization  of 
institutions,  with  special  reference  to  their  internal  arrangements,  W

Disapproving  the  sale  of  the  manual  alphabet  and  other  small  wares,

ances for  instruction,  J.  L.  Noyes,  x,  186.

Expressing  the  opinion  that  instruction  in  art  is  of  special  importance 
in  the  instruction  of  the  deaf,  /.  L.  Peet,  xi,  298. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  the  system  of  deaf-mute  instruction  exist- 
ing in  America  commends  itself  to  the  world,  for  the  reason  that  its 
tendency  is  to  include  all  known  methods  and  expedients  which  have 
been  found  to  be  of  value  in  the  education  of  the  deaf,  while  it  allows 
diversity  and  independence  of  action,  and  works  at  the  same  time  har- 
moniously, aiming  at  the  attainment  of  an  ,  object  common  to  all ;  also 
that  earnest  and  persistent  endeavors  should  be  made  in  every  school 
for  the  deaf  to  teach  every  pupil  to  speak  and  read  from  the  lips,  and 
that  such  efforts  should  be  abandoned  only  when  it  is  plainly  evident 
thrft  the  measure  of  success  attained  does  not  justify  the  necessary  amount 
of  labor ;  provided ,  that  children  who  are  given  to  articulation  teachers 
for  trial  should  be  given  to  articulation  teachers  who  are  trained  for  the 
work,  and  not  to  novices,  before  saying  it  is  a  failure  :  also  that  a  general

test  be  made,  and  those  who  are  found  to  have  sufficient  hearing  to  dis- 
tinguish sounds  should  be  taught  aurally,  E.  M.  Oallaudet,  xi,  167. 

To  memorialize  the  National  Bureau  of  Education  of  the  United  States, 
and  the  Departments  of  Instruction  in  the  several  States,  asking  them  to 
promote  the  introduction  of  the  manual  alphabet  into  the  public  schools,

Requesting  the  American  Book  Company  to  include  in  some  of  their 
publications  a  print  of  the  manual  alphabet,  with  a  short  chapter  upon 
its  history,  use,  convenience,  and  helpfulness,  P.  6.  Oillett,  xii,  284. 

Urging  the  fullest  possible  publication  of  the  returns  of  the  census 
relating  to  the  deaf,  and  the  placing  in  the  safe-keeping  of  the  Executive 
Committee  of  all  material  of  value  which  would  be  likely  to  be  destroyed 
on  the  completion  of  the  census,  A.  G.  Bell,  xii,  327. 

The  First  Convention,  as  above  mentioned,  resolved  to  pub- 
lish a  periodical  devoted  to  the  cause  of  deaf-mute  instruction, 
which  should  be  the  common  property,  as  to  its  control  and 
management,  of  all  the  institutions  for  the  deaf  in  the  country. 
It  was  decided  to  adopt  the  title,  size,  time  of  issuing,  and 
general  appearance  of  a  periodical  which  had  been  published 
by  the  instructors  of  the  Hartford  Institution  for  two  years, 
entitled  the  American  Annals  of  the  Deaf  and  Dumb,  and 
to  regard  the  new  periodical  as  the  continuation  of  the  series 
there  begun.  An  Executive  Committee  was  elected,  to  whom 
"  such  matters  as  might  be  required  by  the  Committee  were 
to  be  referred  by  the  editor,"  and  whose  duty  it  should  be 
'•  to  tender  the  editor  such  aid,  counsel,  and  advice  as  he 
might  require." 

The  publication  of  the  Annah  was  suspended  in  1861, 
owing  to  the  Civil  War,  but  it  was  resumed  by  the  First  Con- 
ference of  Principals  and  Superintendents  of  American  Insti- 
tutions for  the  Deaf,  held  in  Washington  in  1868.  The  new 
Executive  Committee  appointed  by  that  Conference  reported 
to,  and  was  re-elected  by,  the  Seventh  Convention  of  American 
Instructors  of  the  Deaf  in  1870,  and  the  Annals  has  since 
that  time  been  published  by  the  Convention.  In  1886,  by  tide 
unanimous  vote  of  the  Convention,  the  words  "  and  Dumb  " 
were  omitted  from  its  title. 


The  Conventions  of  American  Instructors.  15 

The  published  volumes  of  the  Annals  now  number  thirty- 
seven  ;  they  contain  a  large  and  important  part  of  the  litera- 
ture of  deaf-mute  instruction  in  the  English  language,  and 
many  valuable  translations  of  foreign  works,  old  and  new. 
They  are  thus  almost  indispensable  to  any  reader  of  the  lan- 
g'uage  who  wishes  to  acquaint  himself  with  the  art  of  instruct- 
ing the  deaf,  its  history  and  its  methods.  Two  Indexes,  one 
of  volumes  I-XX,  and  the  other  of  volumes  XXI-XXX,  in- 
clusive, render  a  large  part  of  their  rich  material  available  for 
consultation  and  use,  and  a  third  Index  will  be  published  on 
the  completion  of  the  fortieth  volume. 

The  existence  of  the  Convention  has  been  perpetuated  in 
the  following  manner : 

At  the  First  Convention  a  "  General  Committee,"  consisting 
of  the  heads  of  all  the  institutions  in  the  United  States,  was 
appointed  "  to  arrange  for  the  next  Convention,"  and  "  to  act 
as  a  committee  of  correspondence,  and  as  the  authoritative 
representative  of  the  Convention  when  not  in  session."  At 
the  Third  Convention  a  "  General  Committee "  was  again 
elected  "  to  act  as  the  representative  of  the  Convention  when 
not  in  session."  At  the  Pouriih  Convention  an  "  Executive 
Committee "  of  five  members  was  elected  for  the  same  pur- 
pose. At  the  Fifth  Convention  a  "  Select  Committee "  of 
three  was  appointed  to  determine  the  time  and  place  of  the  next 
Convention.  The  Conventions  having  been  discontinued  on  ac- 
count of  the  Civil  War,  the  Conference  of  Principals  and  Super- 
intendents, held  in  Washington  in  1868,  appointed  a  commit- 
tee of  five  to  make  arrangements  for  a  Convention  to  be  held 
in  1869  or  1870.  The  Seventh  Convention,  instead  of  electing 
a  separate  committee  to  represent  the  Convention  when  not  in 
session,  referred  all  invitations  for  the  entertainment  of  the 
next  Convention  to  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  American 
Annals  of  the  Deaf,  who  were  to  "  determine  the  matter, 
and  duly  announce  the  time  and  place."  The  Eighth  Conven- 
tion appointed  a  "  Standing  Executive  Committee,"  to  consist 
of  five  members,  "  to  be  charged  with  the  same  duties  as  those 
hitherto  discharged  by  the  Committee  of  the  American  An- 
nals." Since  that  time  this  Committee  has  continued  to  repre- 
sent the  Convention  when  not  in  session.  The  Committee  was 
re-elected  at  the  Eleventh  and  Twelfth  Conventions,  and  at 
the  Twelfth  was  increased  in  numbers  by  the  addition  of  two 
new  members. 


16  2^he  Conventions  of  American  Instructors. 

Until  1886  the  title  of  the  Convention  was  the  "  Convention 
of  American  Instructors  of  the  Deaf  and  Dumb."  At  the 
Eleventh  Convention,  held  in  that  year,  it  was  unanimously 
voted,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Executive  Committee,  to 
drop  the  words  "  and  Dumb  "  from  its  title. 

At  the  Tenth  Convention  it  was  voted  that  it  was  desirable 
to  combine  with  the  general  exercises  of  the  Convention  some 
of  the  features  of  normal  institute  work,  and  accordingly,  in 
connection  with  the  Eleventh  and  Twelfth  Conventions,  a  Nor- 
mal Section  was  organized.  Mr.  C.  W.  Ely,  Principal  of  the 
Maryland  School,  conducted  this  Section  in  the  Eleventh  Con- 
vention, and  Dr.  G.  O.  Fay,  of  the  Hartford  Institution,  con- 
ducted it  in  the  Twelfth  Convention. 

At  the  Twelfth  Convention  the  oral  teachers  were  "  invited 
to  form  a  section  for  the  promotion  of  articulation  teaching, 
to  be  organized  under  its  own  officers,  the  hours  of  meeting 
to  be  determined  by  the  appropriate  committee  of  the  Con- 
vention, and  to  be  so  ordered  as  to  harmonize  with  the  gen- 
eral meetings  and  with  the  Normal  Section."  An  Oral  Section 
was  accordingly  organized. 

At  the  Twelfth  Convention  the  numbers  in  attendance  had 
become  so  large  that  it  was  evident  that  the  entertainment  of 
the  Convention  in  future  would  be  a  serious  tax  upon  the  few 
institutions  capable  of  entertaining  it.  It  was  also  the  opinion 
of  some  members  that  more  frequent  meetings  would  add  to 
its  interest  and  profit.  A  committee  was  accordingly  appointed 
to  formulate  such  a  plan  as  might  seem  desirable  for  the  im- 
provement of  the  mode  of  organization.  The  committee  held 
several  meetings,  but  found  it  impracticable  to  report  a  plan 
of  reorganization  at  that  Convention,  and  the  subject  was 
finally  referred  to  the  Standing  Executive  Committee,  to  report 
at  the  next  Convention. 

At  the  Twelfth  Convention  it  was  voted  that  the  next  Con- 
vention should  be  held  in  1893,  during  the  time  of  the  "World's 
Fair,  at  such  place  as  the  Executive  Committee  might  find 
most  advantageous.  The  Committee  have  accordingly  arranged 
a  meeting  to  be  held  at  Chicago  under  the  auspices  of  the 
World's  Congress  Auxiliary  of  the  World's  Columbian  Expo- 
sition. The  meeting  will  be  international  in  character,  and 
one  of  a  series  of  congresses  to  be  held  under  the  auspices  of 
the  Auxiliary.  It  will  be  entitled  the  World's  Congress  of  In- 
structors of  the  Deaf,  and  will  assemble  July  17, 1893.    Philip

THE  CONFEEENCES  OP  PRINCIPALS  AND  SUPEE- 
INTENDENTS  OP  AMEEICAN  SCHOOLS  POE  THE 
DEAP. 

The  Pirst  Conference  of  Principals  and  Superintendents  of 
American  Schools  for  the  Deaf  was  called  by  President  Gal- 
laudet,  in  behalf  of  the  officers  of  the  Columbia  Institution,  at 
Washington,  in  1868,  "  to  discuss  such  questions  as  may  be 
brought  forward  relating  to  the  work  of  deaf-mute  education." 
There  had  been  no  meeting  of  American  teachers  of  the  deaf 
for  ten  years.  During  this  period  public  interest  in  the  sub- 
ject had  increased,  and  two  important  steps  in  the  progress  of 
the  education  of  the  deaf  in  America  had  taken  place,  viz.,  the 
establishment,  in  the  preceding  year,  of  two  oral  schools,  and, 
four  years  previously,  of  the  National  College  for  the  Deaf. 

The  objects  of  the  Conference  were  to  afford  the  heads  of 
schools  an  opportunity  to  discuss  these  and  other  subjects  of 
interest,  and  at  the  same  time  to  make  arrangements  to  resume 
the  holding  of  the  Conventions  of  American  Instructors  of  the 
Deaf  and  the  publication  of  the  American  Annals  of  the  Deaf, 
both  of  which  had  been  suspended  on  account  of  the  Civil  "War. 
The  objects  of  the  Conference  were  fully  and  satisfactorily 
attained. 

At  this  Pirst  Conference  of  Principals  and  Superintendents 
no  suggestion  was  made  with  respect  to  holding  similar  Con- 
ferences in  future  ;  but  at  the  Seventh  Convention  of  Ameri- 
can Instructors,  held  two  years  later,  a  paper  was  signed  by 
the  heads  of  schools  present,  expressing  the  opinion  that  a  bi- 
ennial informal  conference  of  principals  and  superintendents 
would  be  of  advantage  to  the  cause  of  deaf-mute  instruction, 
recommending  that  such  a  conference  be  held  in  the  years  in 
which  no  general  convention  of  instructors  occurred,  and  ap- 
pointing a  committee  to  make  arrangements  for  the  same.  The 
Conferences  have  been  held  quadrennially  since  that  time? 
alternating  with  the  quadrennial  Conventions  of  Instructors. 

The  places  and  times  of  the  several  Conferences  have  been 
as  follows : 

First  Conference,  Washington,  D.  C,  May  12-16,  1868. 
Second  Conference,  Flint,  Michigan,  August  14-15,  1872. 


4  Ihe  Conferences  of  Principals. 

Third  Conference,  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  July  12-14,  1876. 
Fourth  Conference,  Northampton,  Massachusetts,  May  25-28,  1880. 
Fifth  Conference,  Faribault,  Minnesota,  July  9-13,  1884. 
Sixth  (Gallaudet)  Conference,*  Jackson,  Mississippi,  April  14-17, 1888. 
Seventh  Conference,  Colorado  Springs,  Colorado,  August  8-11, 1892. 

The  number  of  members  present  at  the  Conferences  have 

been  as  follows : 

Principals  and 

SuperintendenU.     Honorai-y  Members. 

First  Conference 17  8 

Second  Conference 6  1 

Third  Conference  34 

Fourth  Conference  30  3 

Fifth  Conference 25  54 

Sixth  Conference 24  33 

Seventh  Conference 32  47 

The  proceedings  of  all  the  Conferences  (except  the  Second, 
at  which  there  were  no  deaf  members  present)  have  been  in- 
terpreted in  the  sign-language. 

The  members  of  the  Conferences  have  always  been  the 
guests  of  the  Institution  where  the  Conference  was  held,  and 
a  full  stenographic  report  of  the  proceedings  (except  of  the 
Third  Conference)  has  subsequently  been  published  by  the 
Institution.  A  report  of  the  Proceedings  of  the  Third  Con- 
ference was  published  in  the  American  Annals  of  the  Deaf, 
vol.  xxi,  pp.  201-253. 

Though  the  plan  of  the  Conferences,  as  originally  set  forth, 
proposed  that  they  should  be  informal,  as  a  matter  of  fact  they 
have  not  been  (except  perhaps  the  Second  Conference,  held 
in  1872)  much  less  formal  than  the  Conventions  of  In- 
structors. As  in  the  Conventions  of  Instructors,  the  proceed- 
ings have  consisted  of  papers,  discussions,  and  resolutions,  and 
they  have  been  characterized  by  the  same  freedom  of  speech 
and  the  same  courtesy  in  debate.  Persons  present  who  were 
not  superintendents  or  principals  have  usually  been  admitted 
to  all  the  privileges  of  the  meetings  except  that  of  voting. 

The  papers  presented  to  the  several  Conferences  have  been 
as  follows  rf 

*  At  the  Sixth  Conference  a  memorial  service  was  held  in  memory  of 
Thomas  Hopkins  Gallaudet,  Founder  of  Deaf-Mute  Instruction  in  Amer- 
ica, and  the  Conference,  by  request  of  the  authorities  of  tlie  Institution 
where  it  was  held,  was  named  in  his  honor  the  Gallaudet  Conference.

Arabic  numerals  to  the  page  of  the  published  Proceedings.

The  most  important  resolutions  passed  by  the  several  Con- 
ferences have  been  as  follows  : 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  the  American  system  of  deaf-mute  educa- 
tion, as  practised  and  developed  in  the  institutions  of  the  country  for 


The  Conferences  of  Principals.  7 

fifty  years,  commends  itself  as  in  a  pre-eminent  degree  adapted  to  relieve 
the  peculiar  misfortune  of  deaf-mutes  as  a  class,  and  restore  them  to  the 
blessings  of  society ;  that  it  is  the  duty  of  all  institutions  to  provide 
adequate  means  for  imparting  instruction  in  articulation  and  lip-reading 
to  such  of  their  pupils  as  may  be  able  to  engage  with  profit  in  exercises 
of  this  nature;  that  while  it  is  desirable  to  give  semi-mute  and  semi - 
deaf  children  every  facility  for  retaining  and  improving  any  power  of 
articulate  speech  which  they  may  possess,  it  is  not  profitable  except  in 
promising  cases,  discovered  after  fair  experiment,  to  carry  congenital 
mutes  through  a  course  of  instruction  in  articulation  ;  and  recommend- 
ing to  boards  of  directors  to  take  speedy  measures  to  provide  the  funds 
needed  for  the  added  force  of  instructors  necessary  for  articulation 
teaching,  S.  M.  Gallaudet  and  O.  Stone,  i,  82,  83,  119. 

Becommending  the  establishment  of  high  classes  in  all  the  institutions, 
and  that  the  course  of  study  in  those  classes  be  as  far  as  possible  in  har- 
mony with  the  course  required  for  admission  to  the  National  College, 
B.  Talbot,  i,  115. 

Approving  the  work  of  the  National  College,  and  urging  an  increase 
in  the  number  of  free  students  admitted  from  the  several  States,  /.  L. 
Peet,  i,  119. 

Urging  the  directors  of  institutions  to  foster,  to  the  extent  of  their 
ability,  the  mechanical  departments  in  each  institution,  2.  L.  Peet,  i,  125. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  the  principles  of  Dr.  Isaac  Lewis  Peet's 
"  Initial  Signs  "  are  philosophical  and  susceptible  of  extensive  applica- 
tion, and  recommending  that  earnest  endeavors  be  used  by  all  persons 
who  labor  for  the  deaf  to  bring  this  language  to  the  greatest  possible 
perfection,  P.  G.  Gillett  and  W.  J.  Palmer,  i,  114. 

Appointing  a  committee  to  arrange  for  a  resumption  of  the  Conven- 
tions of  American  Instructors  of  the  Deaf,  I.  L.  Peet,  i,  149. 

Appointing  a  committee  to  resume  the  publication  of  the  American 
Annals  of  the  Deaf,  T.  Maclntire,  i,  149. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  a  proper  classification  is  of  vital  impor- 
tance  to  success  ;  that  intellectual  development  and  mental  ability  should 
be  the  criterion  by  which  to  judge,  and  that  tardiness  in  attendance  is 
a  serious  embarrassment  in  this  work,  J.  L.  Noyes,  ii,  138. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  separate  institutions  for  the  education  of 
the  deaf  and  of  the  blind  should  be  established,  as  the  methods  of  in- 
struction are  totally  different,  W.  J.  Palmer,  ii,  151. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  Professor  Bell's  system  of  "Visible  Speech 
is  philosophical ;  that  it  promises  great  aid  in  teaching  articulation  ;  that 
it  is  deserving  of  a  thorough  experiment  in  our  institutions  ;  and  that  it 
may  be  especially  useful  in  the  correction  of  defective  utterance  among 
semi-mutes,  E.  L.  Bangs,  ii,  177. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that,  as  many  deaf  children  in  all  the  States 
are  growing  up  without  either  mental  or  moral  character,  some  system 
of  obligatory  education  should  be  enacted.  Miss  S.  Fuller,  ii,  193. 

Becommending  the  adoption  of  a  liberal  and  thorough  art  educatioUj 
with  the  view  of  extending  the  field  of  skilled  labor  in  the  arts  and  man- 
ufactures open  to  the  deaf,  T.  Widd,  iii,  224. 


8  The  Conf 67 ences  of  Principals. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  in  the  education  of  the  deaf  the  place  of 
prominence  and  honor  should  be  accorded  to  the  intellectual  and  moral 
training  of  the  pupils,  followed  by  thorough  and  well-provided  instruc- 
tion in  industrial  labor  ;  that  deaf  pupils,  where  their  slay  in  the  insti- 
tution is  limited  to  seven  years,  require  for  their  proper  intellectual 
development,  while  in  school,  the  equivalent  of  five  hours  of  daily  in- 
struction for  at  least  five  days  of  the  week  during  nine  months  of  the 
year  for  seven  years,  under  the  direction  of  well-educated,  vigorous  in- 
structors; and  that  instructors  of  the  deaf  ought  not,  as  a  rule,  to  be 
required  or  permitted  to  spend  more  than  five  hours  a  day  in  the  work  of 
the  class-room,  but  should  be  expected  to  divide  the  remainder  of  their 
time  between  study,  recreation,  and  exercise  in  such  a  manner  as  would 
best  prepare  them  to  sustain  the  drain  upon  their  intellectual  and  nervous 
forces  whit'h  is  inevitable  in  a  proper  discharge  of  their  duties  as  teach- 
ers, E.  M.  Oallaudet,  iii,  235. 

Expressing  approval  of  the  Gallaudet  Home  for  Deaf-Mutes  in  New 
York,  and  commending  it  to  the  sympathy  and  support  of  all  the  insti- 
tutions and  all  friends  of  the  deaf,  J.  8.  Hutton,  iii,  250. 

Suggesting  to  the  directors  of  the  American  Asylum  the  desirableness 
of  effecting  such  a  change  in  the  title  of  their  institution  as  to  eliminate 
therefrom  the  objectionable  word  asylum,  E.  M.  Oallaudet,  iii,  250. 

Appointing  a  committee  to  prepare  a  blank  form  for  the  collection  of 
statistics  concerning  the  deaf,  as  to  the  cause  of  deafness,  degree  of  deaf- 
ness, marriages,  and  all  information  which  is  lacking  to  make  full  and 
complete  records,  in  order  that  all  statistics  so  gained  may  be  uniform, 
J.  A.  Gillespie,  v,  295.     Eeport  of  Committee,  Annals,  xxx,  52. 

Approving  the  practice  of  some  institutions  of  retiring  on  half  pay 
officers  and  teachers  of  long  experience,  whose  vigor  and  manhood  have 
been  spent  in  the  service  of  the  institution,  M.  A.  Mutt,  v,  232. 

Kecommending  that,  in  all  cases  where  it  is  practicable,  special  teach- 
ers in  drawing  be  employed,  J.   W.  Swiler,  v,  127. 

Appointing  a  committee  to  confer  with  the  census  committee  appointed 
by  Congress,  with  regard  to  taking  the  statistics  of  the  deaf,  J.  A. 
Gillespie  and  T.  L.  Moses,  vi,  131. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  the  State  institutions  should  afford  their 
pupils  a  course  of  not  less  than  ten  years  of  primary  and  grammar-school 
instruction  ;  and  appointiug  a  committee  to  make  up  a  schedule  of  a 
course  of  study  desirable  to  be  pursued  by  pupils  who  contemplate 
attendance  upon  the  National  College ;  also  a  definite  course  of  study 
for  pupils,  so  arranged  as  to  be  applicable  to  a  term  of  from  seven  to 
eight  years,  T.  L.  Moses,vi,  218.  Eeport  of  Committee,  Annals,  xxxiv, 
127. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  in  all  schools  for  the  deaf,  pupils  who  are 
able  to  articulate  fluently  and  intelligently  should  recite  orally  in  their 
classes  and  be  encouraged  to  use  their  vocal  organs  on  every  possible 
occasion,  JV.  F.  Walker,  vii,  142. 

Appointing  a  committee  to  consider  the  subject  of  the  classification  of 
methods  of  instruction,  J.  L.  Noyea,  vii,  94. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  there  is  need  of  a  free  technical  and  in- 
dustrial school  for  the  deaf  of  the  whole  nation,  where  instruction  shall 


The  Conferences  of  Principals.  9 

be  given  in  agriculture,  the  meclianie  arts,  the  English  language,  and  the 
various  branches  of  mathematical,  physical,  natural,  and  economic 
science,  with  special  reference  to  their  application  in  the  industries  of 
life,  and  such  useful  handicraft  as  can  be  taught  in  a  school ;  expressing 
the  hope  that,  as  the  General  Government  has  recognized  by  liberal  ap- 
propriations the  value  of  such  colleges  and  institutions  for  normal  youths, 
it  will  be  possible  to  find  some  means  of  providing  such  a  one  for  the 
deaf  of  the  nation ;  and  appointing  a  committee  to  decide  upon  the  gen- 
eral course  of  instruction  at  such  an  institute,  its  methods  of  government, 
the  requirements  of  entrance  as  a  student,  the  apportionment  of  students 
among  the  different  States  and  Territories,  the  proper  location,  and  the 
amount  necessary  to  establish  and  maintain  it,  F.  D.  Clarke,  vii,  101. 

Urging  the  authorities  of  the  National  CoUege  to  provide  for  the 
travelling  expenses  of  worthy  students  residing  in  distant  States,  S.  T. 
Walker,  vii,  121. 

Expressing  the  opinion  that  the  Lyon  Phonetic  Manual  is  ingenious 
and  philosophical  and  may  be  used  as  a  valuable  aid  in  the  instruction 
of  the  deaf  in  articulation  and  speech-reading,  Miss  8.  Fuller,  vii,  145. 

The  Presidents  of  the  Conferences  have  been  as  follows : 

First  Conference,  Haevey  P.  Pebt,  Ph.  D.,  LL.  D.,  Principal  Emeritus

The  American  Association  to  Pro-

Secretary  of  the  Assocmtion. 


THE  AMERICAN  ASSOCIATION   TO   PROMOTE   THE 
TEACHING  OF  SPEECH  TO  THE  DEAF. 

The  American  Association  to  Promote  the  Teaching  of 
Speech  to  the  Deaf  was  organized  during  the  progress  of  the 
Twelfth  Convention  of  American  Instructors  of  the  Deaf,  held 
at  the  New  York  Institution  for  the  Instruction  of  the  Deaf 
and  Dumb  at  Washington  Heights,  New  York  city,  in  August, 
1890. 

This  Association  was  the  expression  of  a  growing  and  posi- 
tive conviction  among  the  educators  of  the  deaf  regarding  the 
teaching  of  speech.  It  was  an  exponent  of  the  same  spirit 
which  influenced  the  quadrennial  Convention,  held  at  Berkeley, 
California,  in  1886,  to  adopt,  unanimously,  a  resolution  which 
was,  in  effect,  that  earnest  and  persistent  efforts  should  be 
made  to  teach  every  deaf  child  while  in  school  to  speak  and 
read  the  lips. 

Although  some  of  the  schools  for  the  deaf,  in  which  speech- 
teaching  had  not  previously  been  made  prominent,  were  now 
acting  in  accordance  with  the  spirit  of  this  resolution,  and  were 
giving  instruction  in  speech  to  all  their  pupils,  yet  the  first  or- 
ganization which  had  for  its  avowed  purpose  the  furtherance  of 
the  policy  therein  advocated  was  the  result  of  a  series  of  meet- 
ings of  teachers  and  others  attending  the  Convention  of  1890 
who  were  especially  interested  in  teaching  the  deaf  to  speak. 
This  step  was  induced  by  the  promise  from  Dr.  Alexander 
Graham  Bell  of  the  munificent  gift  of  $25,000  to  be  paid  upon 
the  incorporation  of  the  Association. 

At  a  formal  meeting  in  Albany  of  the  persons  elected  and 
authorized  to  perfect  the  organization  of  the  Association, 
articles  of  incorporation  were  drawn  up,  dated,  signed,  and 
acknowledged  on  the  4th  September,  1890.  The  certificate  of 
incorporation  was  approved  by  the  Justice  of  the  Supreme 
Court  of  the  Third  Judicial  District  of  the  State  of  New  York, 
and  filed  in  the  office  of  the  Secretary  of  State  at  Albany  on 
the  16th  of  September,  1890. 

The  Association  was  organized  with  a  board  of  directors, 
nine  in  number.  The  names  and  addresses  of  the  directors 
who  were  to  manage  its  concerns  for  the  first  year  were  as 
follows :

Gardiner  G.  Hubbard,  1st  Vice-President,  "Washington,  D.  C. 

Caroline  A.  Yale,  2d  Vice-President,  Northampton,  Mass.

Philip  G.  Gillett,  Jacksonville,  111. 

David  Greenberger,  New  York,  N.  Y. 

Mary  H.  True,  Bethel,  Me. 

The  first  regular  meeting  of  the  board  of  directors  v?as  held 
on  the  16th  and  17th  of  February,  1891,  the  purpose  of  the 
meeting  being  to  frame  and  adopt  a  constitution.  At  this 
meeting  Dr.  A.  Graham  Bell  presented  to  the  Association  the 
gift  of  $25,000  in  accordance  with  the  announcement  made  by 
him  at  the  Twelfth  Convention  of  Instructors.  It  was  decided 
that  this  fund  should  be  known  as  the  Bell-Volta  Fund,  and 
should  be  held  in  the  form  of  a  permanent  investment,  the  in- 
come only  to  be  used. 

The  objects  of  the  Association  as  gathered  from  its  consti- 
tution, certificate  of  incorporation,  and  official  publications 
may  be  thus  stated  : 

First.  To  aid  schools  for  the  deaf  in  their  efforts  to  teach 
speech  and  speech-reading  by  providing  schools  for  the  train- 
ing of  articulation  teachers,  by  the  employment  of  an  agent, 
designated  as  corresponding  secretary,  who  should  by  the  col- 
lection and  publication  of  statistics  and  papers  relating  to  the 
subject,  and  by  conference  with  teachers  and  others,  dissemi- 
nate information  concerning  methods  of  teaching  speech  and 
speech-reading,  and  by  using  all  such  other  means  as  might  be 
deemed  expedient,  to  the  end  that  no  deaf  child  in  America 
should  be  allowed  to  grow  up  ''  deaf  and  dumb  "  or  "  mute  " 
without  earnest  and  persistent  efforts  having  been  made  to 
teach  him  to  speak  and  to  read  the  lips. 

Second.  To  gather  information  respecting  the  instruction 
given  in  speech  in  schools  for  the  deaf  throughout  the  country. 

Third.  To  obtain  from  the  authorities  of  the  various  schools 
for  the  deaf  a  statement  of  the  difficulties  encountered  in 
teaching  speech  to  their  pupils,  to  the  end  that  this  Associa- 
tion might  offer  such  aid  as  might  be  in  its  power  to  overcome 
these  obstacles. 

Fourth.  To  arrange  for  special  courses  of  lectures  and  dis- 
cussions upon  subjects  relating  to  the  teaching  of  speech  and 


Teaching  of  Speech  to  the  Deaf, 


ALrXANDER    GRAHAM   BELL,   M.    D.,    PH.    D. 


(i  The  A  meriian  Association  to  Promote  the 

speech-reading  to  the  deaf,  and  for  the  practical  illustration  of 
class-room  work  by  experienced  teachers  with  classes  of  deaf 
children.  To  this  end  the  Association  should  hold  summer 
meetings  annually. 

Fifth.  To  publish  a  report  of  the  general  proceedings  of  the 
Association  meetings  ;  and  from  time  to  time  to  publish  such 
papers  or  articles  as  might,  in  the  judgment  of  the  Association 
or  its  executive  committee,  be  worthy  of  special  presentation 
to  teachers  of  the  deaf,  and  those  interested  in  oral  instruction, 
under  the  title  of  circulars  of  information. 

Sixth.  To  co-operate  with  the  quadrennial  Convention  of 
the  Instructors  of  the  Deaf. 

The  Association  was  fortunate  in  securing  as  their  corre- 
sponding secretary  Miss  Mary  H.  True,  one  of  the  earliest  and 
ablest  teachers  of  speech  in  the  country.  The  official  duties 
of  this  officer  were  begun  by  visiting  the  schools  for  the  deaf 
in  the  South  and  West;  subsequently,  visits  were  made  to 
the  schools  in  the  North  and  East.  The  conferences  with  the 
several  institutions  visited  were  quasi  confidential.  No  report 
was  therefore  made  regarding  them  to  the  board.  By  respect- 
ing the  confidential  relationship  between  the  Association  and 
the  various  institutions,  the  power  and  usefulness  of  the  cor- 
responding secretary  were  greatly  augmented.  The  most 
kindly  courtesy  was  everywhere  met  with,  and  all  were  found 
ready  to  avail  themselves  of  whatever  the  Association  could 
present  that  would  promote  the  true  interests  of  the  deaf. 
Miss  True's  ripe  experience  enabled  her  to  gain  the  confidence 
and  good-will  of  all,  and  it  was  a  matter  of  no  little  regret 
when,  in  the  fall  of  1892,  her  resignation  as  corresponding 
secretary  was  presented  to  the  board  of  directors. 

The  First  Summer  Meeting  was  held  at  Crosbyside,  Lake 
George,  N.  Y.,  from  July  1st  to  10th,  1891. 

At  ten  o'clock  on  the  morning  of  the  opening  day,  the  presi- 
dent. Dr.  Alexander  Graham  Bell,  called  the  members  of  the 
Association  to  order,  and  announced  that  "  the  proceedings  of 
this  the  First  Summer  Meeting  of  the  American  Association  to 
Promote  the  Teaching  of  Speech  to  the  Deaf  will  now  be 
opened." 

After  the  transaction  of  certain  formal  preliminaries,  the 
president  delivered  his  opening  address,  from  which  the  fol- 
lowing is  taken : 


Teaching  of  Speech  lo  the  Deaf.  7 

Before  proceeding  with  the  regular  work  of  the  meeting,  a  few  words 
concerning  the  origin  of  the  Association  may  not  be  out  of  place. 

Many  of  the  members  present  can  recall  the  time  when  no  articulation 
teachers  were  employed  in  this  country,  and  when  all  our  deaf  children 
were  allowed  to  grow  up  as  "  deaf  and  dumb."  In  the  year  1867  three 
oral  schools  sprang  into  existence,  and  since  that  time  articulation 
teaching  has  assumed  importance  in  the  United  States.  The  number  of 
teachers  engaged  in  the  work  has  constantly  increased  until  now  articu- 
lation teachers  constitute  45  per  cent,  of  the  hearing  teachers  employed 
in  our  schools.  The  number  of  pupils  has  also  increased.  Previously 
to  1867,  few,  if  any,  were  taught  to  speak ;  but  last  year  we  had  under 
instruction  no  less  than  3,682  deaf  children  in  American  schools.  But 
5,219  others,  constituting  58.6  per  cent.,  or  the  majority  of  the  whole, 
received  no  instruction  whatever  in  the  use  of  their  vocal  organs.  These 
were  not  cases  of  pupils  who  had  been  placed  for  trial  in  articulation 
classes  and  had  failed.  Many  of  them,  doubtless,  could  have  been 
taught  to  speak ;  but  from  various  causes,  such  as  lack  of  trained 
teachers,  lack  of  funds,  etc.,  they  had  never  had  a  chance  to  learn.  This 
large  percentage  of  "  dumb"  in  our  schools  for  the  deaf  is  the  cause  of 
the  existence  of  this  Association.  Our  special  work  is  the  reduction  of 
that  percentage. 

Before  the  year  1874,  articulation  teachers  constituted  only  a  small 
minority  of  the  instructors  of  the  deaf,  and  they  possessed  no  organiza- 
tion of  their  own  to  advance  their  work.  In  that  year  organization  was 
for  the  first  time  effected.  On  the  twenty-fourth  of  January,  1874,  those 
teachers  who  employed  my  father's  system  of  Visible  Speech  in  the  in- 
struction of  their  pupils  met  in  convention  in  Worcester,  Mass.*  At  this 
meeting  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from  a  discussion  of  technical  details 
by  specialists  engaged  in  articulation  work  became  so  obvious  that  a 
committee  was  appointed  to  call  another  convention  to  meet  the  same 
year,  and  to  invite  the  attendance  of  all  teachers  of  articulation  and  of 
all  persons  interested  in  the  work.  This  Second  Convention  of  Articula- 
tion Teachers  met  in  Worcester,  Mass.,  on  the  thirteenth  day  of  June, 
1874.t  Oral  teachers,  of  course,  enjoyed  all  the  privileges  and  beueiits 
of  the  quadrennial  Convention  of  the  Instructors  of  the  Deaf  held  in 
America,  so  that  separate  meetings  were  not  imperatively  necessary. 
Still,  the  results  of  the  Second  Convention  of  Articulation  Teachers 
showed  that  a  very  great  advantage  would  be  derived  from  occasional 
meetings  of  this  kind,  and  a  committee  was  appointed  to  call  another 
convention  whenever  in  their  opinion  the  interests  of  articulation  teach- 
ing would  be  advanced  thereby. 

At  the  suggestion  of  Mr.  Greenberger  this  committee  decided  to  call 
another  convention  in  the  year  1884,  and  this  Third  Convention  of 
Articulation  Teachers  met  in  New  York,  June  25,  26,  27,  28,  1884,  at  the

New  York  Institution  for  the  Improved  Instruction  of  Deaf -Mutes.* 
The  results  of  this  meeting  again  proved  the  very  great  importance  of 
special  meetings  of  articulation  teachers.  But  the  opinion  was  ex- 
pressed that  the  interests  of  articulation  teaching  might  be  better 
.  advanced  by  the  organization  of  a  special  section  of  the  Quadrennial 
Convention  to  be  devoted  to  articulation  work,  rather  than  by  holding 
independent  conventions  for  the  purpose.  A  resolution  was  unanimously 
adopted  requesting  the  Eleventh  Quadrennial  Convention  of  Instructors 
of  the  Deaf,  which  was  to  meet  in  California  in  1886,  to  form  an  articu- 
lation section  to  be  devoted  to  the  discussion  of  details  of  articulation 
work  by  the  oral  teachers  of  the  Convention. 

A  committee  was  also  appointed  with  full  powers  to  call  another  sep- 
arate convention  should  they  deem  such  a  course  necessary  or  advisable. 

The  Eleventh  Quadrennial  Convention  of  the  Instructors  of  the  Deaf 
met  in  Berkeley,  California,  on  the  fifteenth  day  of  July,  1886  ;+  but  no 
formal  action  was  taken  upon  the  resolution  requesting  the  formation  of 
an  articulation  section.  The  Convention,  however,  recognizing  the 
great  progress  that  had  been  made  in  the  art  of  teaching  speech  to  the 
deaf,  and  the  injustice  of  designating  as  "  deaf  and  dumb  "  persons  who 
could  speak,  dropped  the  title  "  dumb  "  from  the  name  of  the  Conven- 
tion, and  from  the  name  of  the  Annah — the  official  organ  of  communi- 
cation among  teachers  of  the  deaf.  The  "  American  Annals  of  the  Deaf 
and  Dumb"  became  the  "American  Annals  of  tlie  Deaf"  and  the 
quadrennial  "  Convention  of  American  Instructors  of  the  Deaf  and 
Dumb  "  became  a  Convention  of  "  Instructors  of  the  Deaf."  A  Normal 
Department  of  the  Convention  was  established  in  which  articulation 
work  received  considerable  attention.  The  Convention  also  passed 
unanimously  the  following  resolutions,  which  have  had  an  important 
bearing  upon  the  organization  of  this  body : 

"  Whebeas,  The  experience  of  many  years  in  the  instruction  of  the 
deaf  has  plainly  shown  that  among  the  members  of  this  class  of  persons 
great  differences  exist  in  mental  and  physical  conditions  and  in  capacity 
for  improvement,  making  results  easily  possible  in  certain  cases  which 
are  practically  and  sometimes  actually  unattainable  in  others,  these  dif- 
ferences suggesting  widely  different  treatment  with  different  individuals ; 
it  is,  therefore, 

"  Resohed,  That  the  system  of  instruction  existing  at  present  in  Amer- 
ica commends  itself  to  the  world,  for  the  reason  that  its  tendency  is  to 
include  all  known  methods  and  expedients  which  have  been  found"  to  be 
of  value  in  the  education  of  the  deaf,  while  it  allows  diversity  and  inde- 
pendence of  action,  and  works  at  the  same  time  harmoniously,  aiming 
at  the  attainment  of  an  object  common  to  all. 

' '  Resolved,  That  earnest  and  persistent  endeavors  should  be  made  in 
every  school  for  the  deaf  to  leach  every  pupil  to  speak  and  read  from  the 
lips,  and  that  such  efforts  should  be  abandoned  only  when  it  is  plainly 
evident  that  the  measure  of  success  attained  does  not  justify  the  amount 
of  labor:

'■  Provided,  That  these  children  who  are  given  to  articulation  teachers 
for  trial  should  be  given  to  articulation  teachers  who  are  trained  for  the 
work,  and  not  to  novices,  before  saying  it  is  a  failure  ;  and 

"  Provided,  That  a  general  test  be  made,  and  that  those  who  are  found 
to  have  sufficient  hearing  to  distinguish  sounds  shall  be  taught  aurally." 

In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  California  Convention  had  unanimously 
passed  the  above  resolutions  with  provisos,  the  committee  appointed  by 
the  Third  Convention  of  Articulation  Teachers  did  not  deem  it  necessary 
to  convene  a  special  meeting  of  oral  instructors  between  the  years  1886 
and  1890. 

On  the  twenty-third  day  of  August,  1890,  the  Twelfth  Quadrennial 
Convention  of  American  Instructors  of  the  Deaf  met  in  New  York,  at 
the  New  York  Institution  for  the  Deaf  and  Dumb,  at  Washington 
Heights.*  At  that  Convention  statistics  were  presented  showing  how 
far  the  resolution  of  the  California  Convention,  which  I  have  just  read, 
had  been  carried  into  effect :

These  statistics  show  that  in  spite  of  the  California  resolution,  and 
after  four  years  of  work,  there  were  5,219  deaf  children  in  our  schools 
who  received  no  instruction  in  the  use  of  their  vocal  organs,  and  that 
these  constituted  the  majority  of  the  pupils.  The  oral  teachers  of  the 
Conveiition  met  together  for  the  purpose  of  deliberating  upon  this  re- 
sult and  of  discussing  plans  for  the  advancement  of  articulation  teach- 
ing. 

The  attention  of  the  quadrennial  Convention  was  called  to  the  fact  that 
no  formal  action  had  been  taken  upon  the  resolution  addressed  to  that 
body  by  the  Third  Convention  of  Articulation  Teachers  requesting  the 
organization  of  an  articulation  section,  and  it  was  suggested  that  some 
action  should  be  taken  at  the  present  meeting.  The  matter  was  referred 
to  the  business  committee,  which  reported  favorably  to  the  main  body. 
As  a  result  the  following  resolution  was  unanimously  adopted : 

"  Wheeeas,  At  the  last  Convention  of  Articulation  Teachers  of  the 
Deaf  and  Dumb  a  resolution  was  adopted  looking  to  the  formation  of  a 
section  of  the  American  Instructors  of  the  Deaf,  for  the  promotion  of 
articulation  teaching ;  therefore,  be  it 

' '  Resohed,  That  the  oral  teachers  of  this  Convention  be  invited  to  form 
a  section  for  the  purpose  indicated,  to  be  organized  under  its  own  offi- 
cers ;  the  hours  of  meeting  to  be  determined  by  the  appropriate  commit- 
tee of  the  Convention,  and  to  be  so  ordered  as  to  harmonize  with  the 
general  meetings  and  with  the  normal  section." 

In  response  to  this  invitation,  the  oral  teachers  of  the  Convention  met 
and  organized  an  articulation  section  upon  the  model  of  the  general  Con- 
vention. The  management  was  vested  in  an  executive  committee  of  five 
members,  consisting  of  the  following  persons  :  Miss  Caroline  A.  Yale, 
Miss  Sarah  Fuller,  Miss  Ellen  L.  Barton,  Mr.  David  Greenberger,  and 
Mr.  A.  L.  E.  Crouter.

leaching  of  Speech  to  the  Deaf. 


11 


The  oral  teachers  of  the  Convention,  recognizing  the  fact  that  we  pos- 
sessed in  America  no  chartered  body  of  a  national  character  capable  of 
receiving  donations  and  bequests  for  the  benefit  of  the  deaf,  resolved  to 
effect  a  permanent  organization  of  this  character,  to  be  devoted  to  the 
promotion  of  articulation  teaching. 

A  preliminary  organization  was  effected  on  the  27th  of  August,  1890, 
by  the  election  of  Miss  Yale  as  Chairman  and  Mr.  E.  S.  Thompson  as 
Secretary.  I  will  read  the  minutes  because  it  was  this  meeting  that  gave 
birth  to  our  Association  ;  and  the  members  who  were  present  upon  that 
occasion  are  the  original  promoters  of  this  society  and  will  hereafter  for- 
ever be  distinguished  as  The  Original  Promoters  of  the  Association.  The 
following  are  the  minutes :

"At  a  meeting  held  this  morning  Dr.  Bell  proposed  a  plan  for  a  Na- 
tional Association  for  the  Promotion  of  Teaching  Speech  to  the  Deaf. 
In  case  it  should  become  a  chartered  body  he  would  give  $25,000  to  the 
society.  Mr.  Greenberger  urged  the  necessity  of  annual  meetings  of 
articulation  teachers,  and  suggested  the  idea  of  a  summer  school. 

'  •  Moved  and  passed  that  persons  whose  names  are  on  the  list  taken  by 
the  Secretary  be  considered  members  of  the  Association.

"  E.  S.  THOMPSON,  Secietary." 

The  trustees  appointed  held  a  meeting  in  Albany,  New  York,  on  the 
fourteenth  day  of  September,  1890.  A  constitution  and  by-laws  were 
prepared,  and  "  The  American  Association  to  Promote  the  Teaching  of 
Speech  to  the  Deaf  "  was  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of 
New  York,  on  the  sixteenth  day  of  September,  1S90.  The  ti-ustees  be- 
came the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  new  Association.  It  was  decided  to 
hold  two  meetings  every  year  ;  a  meeting  of  the  whole  Association  to  be 
held  in  the  summer  time,  at  such  places  in  America  as  might  be  decided 
upon  by  the  Board  of  Directors ;  and  a  meeting  of  the  Directors  to  be 
held  in  the  winter  time.  This  is  the  first  summer  meeting  of  the  Asso- 
ciation, but  it  will  not  be  the  last.  The  large  number  of  delegates  pres- 
,ent  shows  the  very  great  interest  that  is  taken  in  our  work,  and  I  trust 
that,  as  a  result  of  this  meeting,  we  shall  find  within  the  next  year  a 
great  increase  iu  the  number  of  deaf  children  who  are  taught  to  speak, 
and  in  the  number  of  articulation  teachers  who  are  employed  in  our 
schools.     ( See  statistics  for  1891  in  Tables  I  and  II.) 

There  has  been  for  a  good  many  years  past  an  unfortunate  antagonism 
between  the  advocates  of  the  "  oral  method  "  of  instruction  and  the  ad- 
vocates of  the  "  combined"  or  "  sign  method."  This  Association  does 
not  propose  to  take  any  part  in  that  controversy.  There  is  a  great  dif- 
ference between  teaching  speech  and  teaching  Try  speech.  The  California 
resolution  shows  that  all  the  teachers  of  the  deaf  in  America,  and  all  the 
schools  for  the  deaf,  whatever  may  be  their  methods  of  instruction,  are 
unanimous  in  the  desire  to  teach  speech  to  all  of  the  deaf  who  can  be 
successfully  instructed.  The  California  resolution  defines  a  neutral 
ground  upon  which  all  teachers  of  the  deaf  may  meet  as  friends.  Upon 
this  neutral  ground  Wrf  stand,  and  we  invite  into  our  organization  sign 
teachers  and  oral  teachers,  and  all  who  believe  that  every  deaf  child 
should  be  given  the  opportunity  to  learn  to  speak  if  he  can,  and  who 
desire  to  help  in  bringing  this  about. 


Teaching  of  Speech  to' the  Deaf.  13 

Upwards  of  one  hundred  and  fifty  members  were  present 
at  this  meeting,  representing  twenty-eight  institutions  for  the 
deaf.  There  was,  therefore,  a  most  excellent  opportunity 
afforded  to  become  acquainted  with  the  various  systems  of 
speech  work.  The  meeting  was  in  all  respects  a  most  profit- 
able and  enjoyable  gathering. 

The  character  and  importance  of  the  work  accomplished 
may  be  seen  by  the  condensed  programme  here  given.

constitutes  a  most  valuable  addition  to  our  literature  upon 
subjects  pertaining  to  the  teaching  of  speech. 

Crosbyside  had  been  found  so  admirably  adapted  to  fill  all 
the  requirements  of  the  Association's  first  meeting  that  it  was 
selected  by  the  board  of  directors  as  the  place  for  the  Second 
Summer  Meeting,  which  was  in  session  from  June  29  to  July 
8,  1892.  The  interest  which  was  manifested  in  the  work  of 
the  Association  by  the  number  present  at  the  first  summer 
meeting  was  now  attested  by  a  stiU  larger  number,  upwards 
of  two  hundred  members  being  in  attendance. 

The  opening  address  of  the  president  contains  so  much  re- 
garding the  special  work  of  the  Association,  as  well  as  regard- 
ing matters  of  general  and  vital  importance  to  the  profession, 
that  it  is  here  reproduced  in  full  with  the  exception  of  a  graph- 
ically presented  statement  of  percentages  of  children  who  re- 
ceive speech  instruction  in  ninety-five  institutions  for  the  deaf, 
and  the  tables  showing  the  figures  upon  which  those  percent- 
ages are  based. 

ADDRESS. 

Ladies  and  Gentlemen  :  As  short  a  time  ago  as  the  year  1890,  such  a 
meeting  as  this  was  supposed  to  be  impossible.  Teachers  of  the  deaf, 
of  course,  have  met  in  conventions  before,  but  they  have  been  enter- 
tained at  the  expense  of  some  school  for  the  deaf.  Teachers  of  the  deaf, 
as  a  rule,  are  not  overburdened  with  means,  and  it  was  supposed  to  be 
impossible  to  bring  about  any  large  gathering  of  this  kind  at  the  expense 
of  the  teachers  themselves. 

Well,  last  year  we  tried  the  experiment,  and  one  hundred  and  fifty 
teachers  of  the  deaf  assembled  at  Lake  George— not  for  three  or  four 
days,  as  had  been  the  ease  in  conventions,  but  for  ten  days— and  paid 
their  own  expenses.  Well,  that  was  an  experiment,  and  it  was  thought 
that  we  could  not  do  that  again,  as  least  not  the  very  next  year ;  but 
again  we  have  come  together  in  increased  numbers,  full  of  energy  and 
enthusiasm  for  our  work.  On  behalf  of  the  board  of  directors,  I  may 
say  that  we  accept  this  large  gathering  as  an  endorsement  of  the  value 
of  the  work  that  was  accomplished  during  the  last  meeting.  We  accept 
it  as  a  proof  that  you  have  been  satisfied,  and  that  the  teachers  who 
came  here  last  year  from  far  and  wide,  at  considerable  expense  and  in- 
convenience to  themselves,  have  profited  by  what  they  found  here,  to 
such  an  extent  that  they  are  willing  to  incur  all  this  expense  and  trouble 
again,  in  the  belief  that  they  will  be  amply  repaid,  and  return  to  their 
schools  better  equipped  for  their  work. 

I  need  hardly  say  that  the  board  of  directors  are  highly  gratified  by 
this  mark  of  your  confidence,  and  -we  trust  that  you  will  all  go  away 
from  Lake  George  with  the  feeling  that  you  have  received  still  more  that 
is  of  value  aud  help  to  you  in  your  noble  work,  and  that  you  will  all  feel 
that  it  has  paid  you  to  come. 


It)  The  American  Association  to  Promote  the 

Upon  this  occasion  it  would  be  a  proper  thing  for  me  to  say  a  few 
words  regarding  the  object  of  our  Association ;  what  we  have  accom- 
plished during  the  past  year,  and  what  we  aim  to  do  in  the  future. 
However,  that  subject  will  come  up  in  our  meeting  this  evening,  and  it 
will  hardly,  therefore,  be  necessary  for  me  this  morning  to  do  more  than 
direct  your  attention  to  the  object  that  brings  us  together — to  the  greiit 
end  and  aim  of  our  existence  as  an  Association — and  to  give  you  some 
report  of  the  progress  of  articulation  teaching  in  America  since  our  last 
meeting. 

For  a  great  many  years  past  the  advocates  of  the  different  methods  of 
educating  the  deaf  have  been  in  generous  rivalry  with  one  another ;  and 
in  our  conventions  we  have  discussed  very  fully  the  relative  merits  of 
the  different  methods  of  instruction.  Into  the  contest  between  the  dif- 
ferent methods  of  instruction  we  don't  propose  to  go.  "We  are  an 
entirely  neutral  body.  In  1886,  at  the  California  Convention,  a  resolu- 
tion was  unanimously  adopted  by  the  entire  profession,  including 
teachers  who  were  violently  opposed  to  one  another  upon  other  subjects. 
It  was  in  effect  that  every  deaf  child  should  be  given  a  chance  to  learn 
to  speak.  It  was  in  effect  that  earnest  and  persistent  endeavors  should 
be  made  in  every  school  for  the  deaf  to  teach  every  child  to  speak  and 
read  from  the  lips.  That  is  the  platform  upon  which  we  stand.  We 
have  come  into  existence  as  an  organization,  not  to  antagonize  any 
school  or  system  of  schools,  but  to  help  schools  of  all  sorts  in  America 
to  carry  out  the  spirit  and  purport  of  that  resolution. 

Report  on  Articulation  Teaching  in  America. 

I  have  made  a  close  examination  of  the  statistics  of  articulation  teach- 
ing in  order  to  ascertain  how  far  that  resolution  has  been  carried  into 
effect.  Great  progress  is  manifest  since  our  last  Summer  Meeting,  but 
though  a  great  increase  has  taken  place  in  the  number  of  articulation 
teachers  employed,  and  in  the  number  of  deaf  pupils  taught  articulation, 
still  the  majority  of  our  pupils  have  not  yet  been  given  an  opportunity 
of  learning  to  speak.  I  beg  to  place  in  your  hands  a  detailed  analysis 
of  the  statistics  of  speech-teaching  in  American  schools  for  the  deaf, 
which  I  have  compiled  from  the  American  Annals  of  th(,  Deafior  your 
information.  The  statistics  concerning  articulation  teaching  extend  back 
only  as  far  as  the  year  1884. 

The  tables  I  have  placed  in  your  hands  will  show  you  the  total  num- 
ber of  pupils  in  each  school  for  the  deaf  in  the  United  States  and  the 
Dominion  of  Canada,  and  the  total  number  of  pupils  taught  speech  in 
each  year  from  1884  up  to  the  present  time.  From  these  figures  I  have 
calculated  the  percentage  of  pupils  taught  speech  in  each  school  for  the 
deaf,  and  the  results  are  shown  graphically  in  the  charts  placed  in  your 
hands.  The  tables  also  include  the  total  number  of  teachers  employed 
in  each  school  for  the  deaf,  and  the  total  number  of  these  who  are  en- 
gaged in  teaching  articulation. 

The  following  tables  give  a  summary  of  the  results  shown  in  detail  in 
the  Appendix.  They  exhibit  the  general  statistics  of  articulation  teach- 
ing in  the  United  States  up  to  January,  1892.

The  total  number  of  teachers  of  the  deaf  employed  in  the  United 
States  in  1890  was  641,  and  in  1891,  686.  This  is  an  increase  of  45. 
When  we  come  to  analyze  the  details,  we  find  that  this  is  an  increase 
exclusively  of  articulation  teachei'S.  This  is  shown  by  the  following  facts  : 
In  1890  there  were  213  articulation  teachers  employed,  whereas  in  1891 


18  The  American  Association  to  Promote  the 

there  were  260 — an  increase  of  47  articulation  teachers.  The  first  statis- 
tics upon  this  subject  were  collected  by  the  Annals  in  1886.  In  that 
year  we  find  articulation  teachers  constituted  32.8  per  cent,  of  the  hear- 
ing teachers  in  our  soliools  for  the  deaf;  in  1887  they  constituted  40..5 
per  cent. ;  in  1888,  44  per  cent.  ;  in  1889,  45.7  per  cent.  ;  in  1890,  45.2 
per  cent. ;  in  1891,  the  latest  returns,  50  per  cent.  Indeed,  they  consti- 
tuted one  more  than  50  per  cent.  There  were  260  articulation  teachers 
to  259  hearing  teachers  who  were  not  engaged  in  articulation  work. 

In  regard  to  the  proportion  of  deaf  pupils  taught  speech,,  the  increase 
during  the  past  year  has  been  very  marked.  In  1890  there  were  3,682 
deaf  children  in  the  United  States  taught  speech  ;  in  1891,  4,245 — an  in- 
crease of  563,  In  1890,  41.3  per  cent,  of  our  pupils  were  taught  speech  ; 
in  1891,  46  per  cent.  I  am  sure  that  this  increase  is  due  very  greatly  to 
the  stimulus  of  the  first  Summer  Meeting  of  this  Association. 

The  following  diagram  illustrates  in  a  graphical  manner  the  percent- 
age of  pupils  taught  speech  in  American  schools  for  the  deaf  siace  the 
year  1884,  when  statistics  upon  the  subject  were  first  collected  by  the 
Annals :

TAUGHT  SPEECH.  I  NOT    TAUGHT    SPEECH. 


No  attempts  to  teach  speech  have  been  made  to  the  percentage  of  pu- 
pils shown  by  the  black  lines  on  the  right-hand  side  of  the  diagram  ; 
and,  unfortunately,  these  pupils  still  constitute  the  majority  of  the 
whole.  There  is  still  work,  therefore,  for  this  Association  to  do,  for  no 
attempt  has  yet  been  made  to  teach  speech  to  54  per  cent,  of  our  pupils. 
Of  course,  the  statistics  in  the  Annals  include  the  whole  of  our  pupils, 
old  as  well  as  young ;  and  it  has  occurred  to  me,  therefore,  that  they 
may  not  give'us  a  true  indication  of  the  extent  to  which  the  California 
resolution  is  being  carried  out  in  the  country  at  large,  and  that  a  better 
indication  would  be  obtained  by  statistics  concerning  younger  pupils 
alone.  I  therefore  sent  out  a  circular  letter  of  inquiry  to  the  superin- 
tendents and  principals  of  American  schools  for  the  deaf,  requesting — 

(1)  The  total  number  of  new  pupils  admitted  during  the  school  year 
just  closed ; 

(2)  The  number  of  new  pupils  taught  speech;   and 

(3)  The  number  of  these  taught  by  speech. 

The  following  table  shows  the  results  of  the  inquiry  :

A.  Complete  returns  were  received  from  these  schools. 

Ji.  The  returns  received  from  these  -chools  did  not  state  definitely  the 
number  of  nev?  pupils  taught  by  speech.  The  Canadian  schools  marked 
'■B"  refer  to  the  two  Koman  Catholic  schools  in  Montreal.  They 
return  126  pupils,  or  41  per  cent,  of  the  whole,  as  taught  by  speech; 
but  do  not  state  how  many  of  the  new  pupils  were  so  taught. 

O.  These  schools  did  not  reply  to  the  circular  letter  of  inquiry. 

Beplies  have  been  received  from  schools  containing  7,987  pupils,  or  80 
per  cent,  of  the  whole  number  under  instruction  in  the  United  States 
and  Canada.  It  is  encouraging  to  note  that  while  46  per  cent,  of  the 
whole  number  in  our  schools  last,  year  were  taught  articulation,  70  per 
cent,  of  the  younger  pupils  were  afforded  an  opportunity  of  learning  to 
speak.  The  statistics  published  in  the  Annals  are  somewhat  defective, 
because,  while  they  give  us  the  total  number  of  pupils  taught  speech, 
they  do  not  give  us  the  number  taught  by  speech ;  so  that  we  have  no 
statistics  by  which  we  can  measure  the  progress  of  the  oral  method  of 
teaching  in  America. 

Professor  Joseph  C.  Gordon,  of  the  National  Deaf-Mute  College,  in 
some  editorial  remarks  prefacing  a  volume  entitled  "The  Education  of 
the  Deaf,"  about  to  be  issued  by  the  Volta  Bureau,  says  :  "  The  returns 
of  pupils  taught  by  speech  are  incomplete.  The  number  reported  for 
1891  is  963,  or  10.4  per  cent,  of  the  school  population."  The  above  table 
indicates  that  the  percentage,  in  the  case  of  the  younger  pupils,  must  be 
very  much  larger.  Out  of  836  new  pupils  admitted  during  the  past 
school  year,  363,  or  43  per  cent.,  were  taught  by  speech. 

This  percentage,  however,  is  probably  excessive,  because  the  table 


20  The  American  Association  to  Promote  the 

shows  that  those  schools  which  have  done  the  most  work  in  articulation 
teaching  have  been  the  most  ready  to  respond  to  inquiries  relating  to 
the  subject.  We  cannot^  therefore,  assume  that  the  percentage  holds 
for  the  schools  that  have  not  replied  to  my  circular  letter. 

Still,  even  if  we  assume  that  these  363  deaf  children  were  all  who  were 
taught  by  the  oral  method,  the  percentage  must  be  very  much  higher 
than  that  given  by  Professor  Gordon.  This  will  be  obvious  from  the  fol- 
lowing considerations  : 

The  schools  containing  these  cases  had  a  total  attendance  of  5,614 
pupils,  of  whom  836.  or  15  per  cent.,  were  new  pupils  admitted  during 
the  past  school  year. 

If  this  proportion  held  good  for  the  whole  country,  then  there  must 
have  been  a  total  of  1,385  new  pupils,  or  15  per  cent,  of  9,232,  admitted 
during  the  year  just  closed. 

Now,  363  of  these  at  least,  or  26  per  cent.,  we  know  were  taught  by 
speech.  Hence,  for  the  younger  pupils  the  true  proportion  taught  by 
speech  lies  somewhere  between  26  and  43  per  cent,  of  the  whole.  The 
lowest  estimate  very  much  exceeds  the  figures  of  Professor  Gordon. 

We  have  no  means  of  ascertaining  whether  the  proportion  of  our  pu- 
pils taught  by  speech  is  increasing  or  diminishing  ;  and  I  think  it  wouhi 
be  well  for  this  Association  to  direct  the  attention  of  the  editor  of  the 
AnnaU  to  the  importance  of  collecting  and  publishing  statistics  upon 
this  subject. 

I  have  glanced  over  the  reports  of  American  schools  for  the  deaf  that 
have  been  published  since  our  last  meeting,  and  there  are  a  few  points 
contained  in  them  to  which  I  shall  direct  your  attention. 

In  the  Twelfth  Biennial  Report  of  the  American  Asylum  at  Hartford, 
the  principal,  Dr.  Job  Williams,  gives  his  views  upon  what  constitutes 
success  in  articulation  work.     He  says  : 

"  We  hold  that  direct  and  earnest  effort  should  be  made  by  expert 
teachers  of  those  branches  to  teach  speech  and  speech,  reading  to  every 
pupil,  and  in  no  case  should  that  effort  be  abandoned  until  those  teach- 
ers are  convinced  that  the  pupil  will  never  acquire  enough  of  speech  to 
be  of  any  practical  use.  In  some  very  unpromising  cases  the  possibility 
of  acquiring  speech  is  not  given  up  for  two  or  three  years.  Here  let  me 
say  that  the  criterion  of  success  in  speech  should  not  be  perfect  natural- 
ness of  tone  and  inflection.  It  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect  that 
where  the  sense  of  hearing  is  wanting.  Intelligibility  is  the  prime  requi- 
site of  good  speech.  Tone  and  inflection  are  secondary  considerations. 
Any  pupil  who  has  mastered  speech  and  lip-reading  so  far  as  to  be  able  to 
cnrrfi  on  convei'sntion  in  regard  to  the  ordinary  affairs  of  life  in  speech  so 
plain  as  to  be  readily  understood  by  the  members  of  his  own  family,  even 
though  others  fail  to  understand  him,  should  be  counted  as  a  siiccessful 
articulator  and  lip-reader.  It  is  worth  while  to  continue  the  instruction 
in  these  branches  in  many  cases  where  the  degree  of  success  falls  con- 
siderably short  of  the  ability  to  carry  on  an  extended  conversation,  pro- 
vided that  what  of  speech  is  acquired  is  easily  understood.  We  must 
recognize  the  fact  that  intelligible  speech  is  the  readiest  and  most  ac- 
ceptable means  of  communication  with  people  in  general,  but  it  must  be 
intelligible.  It  is  worth  while  for  a  child  to  gain  even  a  limited  amount 
of  speech  and  lip-reading  (the  latter  is  as  important  as  the  former)  in  all 
eases  where  it  can  be  done  without  serious  sacrifice  in  mental  develop- 
ment and  acquisition  of  language." 


Teaching  of  Speech  to  the  Deaf.  21 

We  must  all  agree  with  Mr.  Williams  in  these  remarks.  We  should, 
of  course,  aim  to  have  our  pupils  speak  so  clearly  and  distinctly  that 
any  one  can  understand  them ;  but  I  am  sure  Mr.  Williams  is  right  in 
saying  that  a  much  lower  degree  of  proficiency  might  constitute  a  pupil 
a  successful  articulator  and  speech-reader.  Mr.  Williams  rightly  claims 
that  oral  instruction  is  successful  if  the  speech  of  pupils  is  intelligible 
to  their  friends  in  their  own  homes  and  among  their  own  people,  even 
though  others  have  difficulty  in  understanding  what  they  say.  It  is  a 
very  difficult  thing  for  a  teacher,  and  especially  for  an  articulation 
teacher,  to  realize  this.  I  have  been  myself  a  teacher  of  articulation, 
and  I  know  how  you  feel.  Your  ears  are  sensitive  to  mispronunciations, 
as  mine  were.  It  is  difficult  for  you  to  realize  that  voices  which  to  you 
may  be  disagreeable  in  tone  may  be  very  sweet  and  pleasant  to  those  at 
home.  It  is  difficult  for  you  to  realize  that  imperfect  speech  may  be 
better  than  none  at  all ;  and  that  speech  so  defective  as  to  be  unintelli- 
gible to  strangers  may  be  of  the  greatest  value  to  the  pupils,  in  their  own 
homes  and  among  their  own  people,  as  a  means  of  communication. 
This  fact  has  been  specially  impressed  upon  my  attention  by  the  report 
of  the  Mississippi  Institution,  which,  in  many  respects,  is  a  very  re- 
markable document.  That  Institution  has  had  a  class  of  twelve  pupils 
taught  altogether  by  speech  and  speech-reading.  While  all  of  them 
have  made  great  progress  in  speech-reading,  sorr:e  have  gained  but  little 
power  of  speech.     Mr.  Dobyns,  the  principal,  says : 

"  While  I  have  been  more  than  satisfied  that  the  Institution  was  justi- 
fiable in  the  small  outlay  in  this  department  of  instruction,  yet,  for  fear 
my  zeal  to  keep  pace  with  the  times  may  have  gotten  the  better  of  my 
judgment,  I  submitted  the  following  questions  to  the  parents  of  the 
pupils  in  this  claes,  knowing  they  desired  the  very  best  thing  for  their 
children." 

I  will  not  take  up  your  time  by  reading  the  questions  and  replies,  but 
will  merely  say  that  the  answers  demonstrate  that  speech  which  may  be 
thought  very  little  of  by  the  sensitive  ear  of  the  teacher  is  considered  a 
blessing  at  home.  None  of  these  parents  desire  their  children  to  be  re- 
moved from  the  oral  department  of  the  school,  but,  on  the  contrary, 
they  all  earnestly  request  that  their  children  be  continued  in  this  depart- 
ment. Where  there  is  any  difficulty  in  deciding  upon  the  value  and  suc- 
cess of  the  articulation  taught  to  our  pupils,  with  whom  should  the  de-  . 
cision  rest  ?  Surely  with  those  who  are  nearest  and  dearest  to  our  pupils 
— with  those  who  have  their  interest  most  at  heart.  Mr.  Dobyns,  I  am 
sure,  is  right  in  referring  the  question  to  the  parents  and  friends  at 
home. 

In  this  report  Mr.  Dobyns  incidentally  remarks  that  now,  whenever  a 
new  pupil  enters  the  Institution,  the  request  comes  from  the  parents  : 
"  Please  see  if  you  can't  teach  my  child  to  speak."  He  has,  therefore, 
asked  from  the  Mississippi  legislature  an  increase  of  appropriation  to 
enable  him  to  employ  another  articulation  teacher ;  and  I  am  sure  we 
all  hope  he  may  get  it. 

There  is  another  point  in  the  report  of  the  Mississippi  Institution  to 
which  I  would  direct  your  attention.     Mr.   Dobyns  has  collected  and 


22  The  American  Association  to  Promote  t/ie 

published  statistics  concerning  the  earnings  of  former  pupils,  and  he 
goes  to  his  State  legislature  with  the  proof  that  the  graduates  of  his 
school,  so  far  from  being  dependent  upon  the  public  for  support,  are 
actually  wealth-producers,  earning  annually  a  larger  amount  than  the 
State  appropriates  for  the, support  of  the  school.  He  proves  that  it  is 
not  a  matter  of  charity  to  educate  the  deaf,  and  demonstrates  that  the 
money  appropriated  for  this  purpose  is  in  the  nature  of  an  investment, 
yielding  profitable  returns  to  the  State. 

I  would  urge  all  schools  for  the  deaf  to  carry  out  this  plan  of  Mr. 
Dobyns,  and  collect  statistics  concerning  the  earnings  of  former  pupils. 
I  would  suggest  that  these  statistics  should  be  so  tabulated  as  to  distin- 
guish the  earnings  of  the  pupils  who  could  articulate  and  read  speech 
from  the  mouth  from  those  who  could  not.  I  have  no  doubt  that  pupils 
who  speak  have  an  advantage  in  life  over  those  who  do  not,  and  that 
statistics  will  demonstrate  that  their  average  earnings  exceed  the  aver- 
age earnings  of  those  who  are  unable  to  articulate.  If  this  should  turn 
out  to  be  the  ease,  what  an  argument  it  would  be  to  present  to  legisla- 
tures in  favor  of  appropriations  for  articulation  teaching ! 

One  of  our  main  objects  as  an  association  is  to  help  schools  for  the 
deaf  in  their  efforts  to  teach  speech  and  speech-reading,  and  I  do  not 
know  how  we  could  better  accomplish  that  object  than  by  collecting 
statistics  of  this  character.  I  venture  to  predict  we  shall  find  that  our 
former  pupils  who  speak,  even  though  they  may  be  unable  to  read 
speech,  earn  more  per  annum  than  those  who  are  forced  to  resort  exclu- 
sively to  manual  means  of  communication,  and  those  of  them  who  can 
read  speech,  as  well  as  speak,  are  still  better  off  in  life. 

Mr.  Davidson,  of  the  Pennsylvania  Institution,  has  suggested  another 
valuable  line  of  inquiry.  From  a  comparison  of  numerous  letters  in  his 
possession,  he  makes  the  assertion  that  orally-taught  pupils  improve  in 
their  knowledge  and  use  of  language  after  leaving  school.  I  would  sug- 
gest the  importance  of  preserving  uncorrected  letters  of  your  pupils  dur- 
ing ihe  whole  period  of  their  school-life,  and  of  keeping  up  correspondence 
with  them  after  they  leave  school.  A  comparison  of  letters,  written  by 
the  same  pupil  at  different  periods  of  time,  would  be  invaluable  as  a 
means  of  determining  his  progress  ;  and  the  correspondence  in  adult 
life  might  also  be  utilized  for  the  purpose  of  collecting  statistics  con- 
cerning the  earnings  and  general  success  in  life  of  our  pupils. 

The  pleasure  and  benefit  afforded  by  the  Second  Summer 
Meeting  was  in  no  respect  inferior  to  that  enjoyed  the  previous 
year,  and  the  programme,  though  perhaps  not  so  elaborate,  was 
full  of  profit  and  helpful  suggestions.

On  the  closing  day  of  the  meeting  Mr.  John  E.  Ray,  Prin- 
cipal of  the  Colorado  Institution,  extended  to  the  Association 
a  formal  and  urgent  invitation  to  be  present  at  the  Conference 
of  Principals  to  be  held  at  Colorado  Springs  in  August,  1892. 
He  gave  the  assurance  that  all  members  of  the  Association 
who  might  find  it  possible  to  be  present  upon  that  occasion 
would  be  most  heartily  welcomed  by  the  Institution,  whose 
hospitality  he  had  been  officially  authorized  to  extend. 


24  The,  American  Association  to  Promote  the 

The  Report  of  the  Second  Summer  Meeting,  which  will  be 
uniform  with  that  of  the  previous  meeting,  is  now  in  press, 
and  will  contain  matters  of  great  value  to  all  instructors  of  the 
deaf. 

It  is  now  (April,  1893)  too  early  to  speak  otherwise  than 
prospectively  of  the  Third  Summer  Meeting.  It  may  be 
stated,  however,  that  arrangements  have  been  made  for  hold- 
ing this  meeting  in  Chicago  from  July  14  to  28,  1893.  The 
Association  has  been  fortunate  in  securing  accommodations  in 
the  buildings  of  the  University  of  Chicago.  The  purpose  of 
this  meeting  is  to  strengthen  the  bonds  of  affiliation  among 
the  teachers  and  friends  of  the  deaf  rather  than  to  afford  a 
season  of  hard  work  and  study  such  as  has  hitherto  character- 
ized the  meetings  of  the  Association.  Aside  from  a  few  even- 
ing lectures  by  distinguished  educators,  the  general  gatherings 
of  the  members  will  be  for  the  most  part  of  a  purely  social 
nature. 

This  seems  to  be  a  fitting  time  and  place  for  rendering  the 
grateful  acknowledgments  of  the  Association  to  the  Volta 
Bureau  for  its  manifest  interest  in  and  appreciation  of  the 
work  of  the  Association.  Aside  from  the  valuable  publica- 
tions which  from  time  to  time  have  been  distributed  gratis  to 
members,  the  Bureau  also  prepared  on  the  occasion  of  our 
First  Summer  Meeting  an  exquisite  memento  entitled  "  Helen 
Keller.^Souvenir  of  the  Frst  Summer  Meeting  of  the  American 
Association  to  Promote  the  Teaching  of  Speech  to  the  Deaf." 
It  contains  a  fine  likeness  of  Miss  Keller,  a  brief  outline  of 
her  early  history,  an  account  of  her  wonderful  acquisition  of 
speech,  together  with  two  of  her  letters  in  facsimile,  the 
whole  executed  in  the  highest  style  of  typographical  art. 

The  "  A.  M.  Bell  Souvenir  of  the  Second  Summer  Meeting," 
which  was  distributed  in  the  fall  of  1892,  was  the  personal 
gift  of  Prof.  A.  Melville  Bell  to  the  teachers  then  members  of 
the  Association.  It  consists  of  a  book  folio  containing  Prof. 
Bell's  "  Faults  of  Speech,"  "  Speech-Reading  and  Articulation 
Teaching,"  "Essays  and  Postscripts  of  Elocution,"  "Bell's 
Popular  Shorthand,"  and  "  University  Lectures  on  Phonetics." 
This  collection  of  works  forms  a  most  valuable  acquisition  to 
the  library  of  all  teachers  who  were  fortunate  enough  to  have 
their  names  on  the  Association's  roll  of  membership.  This 
Souvenir  was  also  distributed  through  the  courtesy  of  the 
Volta  Bureau,  which  added  an  excellent  portrait  of  the  donor. 


Teaching  of  speech  to  the  Deaf.  25 

accompanied  by  a  brief  biography  of  Prof.  A.  Melville  Bell 
and  a  bibliography  of  his  works,  that  includes  a  list  of  some 
forty  publications.  In  the  same  case  is  also  a  Report  of  the 
Convention  of  Articulation  Teachers  held  in  1884,  and  a  pam- 
phlet on  "The  Toy  Object  Method,"  by  Miss  Estella  V. 
Sutton. 

The  Association  has  printed  and  distributed  three  publica- 
tions, designated  as  Circulars  of  Information. 

Circular  No.  1,  on  "  The  Word  Method,"  was  prepared  by 
Mr.  David  Greenberger,  Priacipal  of  the  Institution  for  the 
Improved  Instruction  of  the  Deaf.  This  is  an  able  and  inter- 
esting description  of  the  Word  Method  of  Teaching  Speech. 

Circular  No.  2,  prepared  by  Mr.  Edmund  Lyon,  of  Roches- 
ter, is  an  exposition  of  the  Lyon  Phonetic  Manual,  giving  the 
rationale  of  the  Manual,  together  with  practical  hints  regard- 
ing its  acquisition.  This  Manual  has  been  adopted  by  the 
Rochester  School  and  is  found  to  be  a  most  valuable  aid  in 
speech  work. 

Circular  No.  3  has  for  its  subject  "  The  Life  and  Work  of 
Zerah  Whipple,"  written  by  Miss  Daisy  M.  Way,  of  Kansas 
City,  who  was  at  one  time  a  pupil  in  the  Whipple  School.  To 
the  preparation  of  this  Circular  Miss  Way  has  most  conscien- 
tiously devoted  her  best  talents,  and  by  it  is  perpetuated  the 
memory  of  one  of  the  most  remarkable  pioneer  speech  instruc- 
tors of  the  deaf. 

In  writing  the  history  of  this  Association,  which  has  not  yet 
completed  the  third  year,  scarcely  more  than  its  aims,  and  the 
methods  adopted  for  their  accomplishment,  can  be  given. 
Though  we  have  the  grateful  assurance  that  its  influence  is 
being  widely  felt  and  its  work  appreciated,  yet  it  is  too  early  to 
speak  of  results.  The  seed-time  has  not  yet  passed ;  but  if  the 
high  purposes  of  the  Association  are  devotedly  adhered  to,  we 
may  confidently  expect  the  fruitage  to  be  both  fair  and  ample. 

The  Association  was  organized  not  exclusively  by,  or  exclu- 
sively for,  oralists,  but  welcomes  to  its  membership  aU  teachers 
of  the  deaf,  all  parents  of  deaf  children,  and  all  persons  inter- 
ested in  or  desirous  of  promoting  in  any  way  the  work  of 
teaching  speech  to  the  deaf.  In  short,  the  Association  com- 
mends itself  to  all  persons  interested  in  philanthropic  work, 
and  all  such  are  eligible  to  membership. 

The  friends  of  speech-teaching  united  as  an  organized  body 
in  order  that  unity  of  interest  should  give  that  co-operation 


26  The  American  Association  to  Promote  the 

which  would  not  only  secure  recognition  of  the  good  already 
accomplished,  but  stimulate  every  one  engaged  in  teaching 
speech  to  the  deaf  to  higher  results.

JEREMIAH  M.  RUSK. 

As  Governor  of  Wisconsin  he  favored   Public  \\\y  Schools  for  deat-mutes,  and  in 

1S85  signed  the  bill  providing  for  their  establishment,  under  which 

the  Wisconsin  system  is  being  developed. 


The  Wisconsin  System  of  Public  Day  Schools 
for  Deaf  Mutes. 


Wisconsin  laid  the  foundations  of  her  educational  sys- 
tem in  accordance  with  the  wisdom  and  conditions  of  the 
period.  On  these  she  has  built  her  schools  and  educational 
institutions,  which  have  developed  with  her  growth,  pro- 
gress and  enlightenment  inspired  by  a  spirit  of,  humanity. 

In  providing  for  the  education  of  her  deaf-mute  chil- 
dren she  has  shown  moral  elevation  and  refined  sympa- 
thies. 

STATE  INSTITUTION    FOR    THE   DEAF. 

The  nucleus  for  her  system  of  educating  deaf-mutes 
was  a  small  private  school  at  Delavan  opened  at  an  early 
day.  From  that  school  sprang  the  state  institution  for  the 
deaf,  which  has  taken  high  rank  among  institutions  of  its 
class.  During  a  period  of  about  twenty-five  years  no  other 
school  existed  in  Wisconsin  for  the  education  of  deaf-mutes. 
Indeed,  no  other  provision  was  suggested  or  deemed  desira- 
ble. Deaf-mute  children  were  unavoidably  removed  from 
their  homes,  separated  from  their  families,  transported  to 
Delavan  and  there  confined  in  the  state  institution  during 
the  period  of  their  education.  They  were  shut  up  with 
deaf-mutes,  with  little  opportunity  for  associating  with  hear- 
ing and  speaking  people,  and,  being  taught  mostly  by  signs, 
were  inadequately  prepared  to  associate  with  hearing  and 
speaking  communities.  They  were,  however,  well  cared  for 
and  as  well  taught  by  the  sign  method  as  possible,  and  gen- 
erally became  good  and  useful  citizens. 

The  state  institution  for  the  deaf  has  ever  been,  and  will 
doubtless  long  continue  to  be,  a  blessing  to  deaf-mutes  and 
to  the  commonwealth,  but  its  usefulness  will  increase  and  its 
right  to  exist  be  prolonged  in  proportion  as  it  advances  in 
the  oral  method  of  educating  deaf-mutes,  which  must  neces- 
sarily be  slow,  if  the  sign  and  orally  taught  deaf-mutes  are 
allowed  to  freely  mingle,  as  seems  inevitable,  in  that  institu- 
tion. 

With  the  growth  of  the  state  and  the  increase  of  the 
population,  it  became  necessary  from  time  to  time  to  enlarge 


4  PUBLIC    DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF    MUTES. 

the  institution  at  Delavan  to  meet  increasing  demands  upon 
it,  until  it  had  an  annual  attendance  of  nearly  two  hundred 
deaf-mute  children,  maintained  and  taught  at  a  per  capita 
cost  origmally  of  about  $200,  which  has  been  gradually  re- 
duced to  about  |150  per  annum;  not  counting  the  invest- 
ment in  the  plant,  which  brings  the  per  capita  cost  consider- 
ably higher. 

In  later  years,  improvements  in  the  methods  of  instruc- 
tion were  introduced  into  the  institution  at  Delavan,  where- 
by semi-mutes  and  those  believed  to  have  special  aptitude 
for  it  are  taught  orally,  and  industrial  instruction  and  train- 
ing have  also  been  introduced. 

DAWN  OF  A  BETTER  ERA. 

The  tide  of  immigration  brought  to  Wisconsin,  many 
intelligent  Germans  acquainted  with  the  articulate  method 
of  teaching  the  deaf  universal  in  Germany.  Indeed,  the  oral 
method  of  teaching  the  deaf  was  beginning  to  attract  general 
attention,  and  the  fullness  of  time  had  arrived  for  Wisconsin 
to  advance  in  this  direction.  A  few  Germans  in  Milwaukee 
started  the  movement,  the  honor  of  which  belongs  to  the  late 
Peter  L.  Dohmen  and  Mr.  Carl  Trieschmann.  They  formed 
the  acquaintance  of  Prof.  Adam  Stettner,  a  teacher  of  articu- 
lation for  deaf-mutes,  and  encouraged  him  to  open  such  a 
school  in  Milwaukee,  which  he  did  January  14,  1878,  with 
four  pupils,  which  increased  that  year  to  seventeen  pupils. 
This  was  a  boarding  and  day  school  taught  at  first  in  the 
German  language.  A  number  of  philanthropic  citizens, 
mostly  Germans,  soon  became  interested  in  the  school  and  its 
methods  of  instruction,  and  formed  an  association  to  assist  in- 
digent children  to  its  benefits  and  promote  the  spread  of  the 
oral  methods  of  educating  deaf-mutes. 

WISCONSIN  PHONOLOGICAL  INSTITUTE. 

In  June,  1878,  a  permanent  organization  was  effected, 
which  was  incorporated  under  the  title  of  the  "  Wisconsin  Pho- 
nological Institute"  January  20, 1879,  with  120  members.  For 
a  time  it  conducted  its  proceedings  and  kept  its  records  in  the 
German  language: 

The  first  officers  were  president,  Guido  Pfister ;  vice- 
president,  B.  Leidersdorf ;  secretary,  P.  L;  Dohrnen  ;  treasurer, 
L.  Teweles;  trustees,  C.  Trieschmann,  J.  F.  Singer  and  B. 
Stern.  Guido  Ptister  was  succeeded  in  the  presidency  by  Mr. 
Bernhard  Stern,  whose  energy  and  intelligent  devotion  have 
greatly  advanced  the  cause.  .    ,

ladies'  aid  society. 

Knowing  that  the  mothers  of  the  city  would  sympathize 
deeply  with  the  unfortunate  class  of  children  fostered  by  the 
institute,  the  board  of  trustees,  October,  1878,  extended  an 
invitation  to  the  ladies  of  Milwaukee  to  lend  their  assistance, 
which  they  did  by  forming,  November  15, 1878,  a  ladies'  aid 
societj',  which  soon  had  191  members  paying  quarterly  dues 
of  $1.00  each.  The  revenues  from  this  source  were  put  at 
interest,  as  a  fund  to  purchase  or  erect  suitable  buildings  for 
a  school,  but  was  subsequently  devoted  to  training  teachers 
of  the  deaf  by  the  oral  method. 

The  ladies'  aid  society  also  watched  over  the  children, 
provided  instruction  in  sewing,  and  -gave  them  delightful 
picnic  and  Christmas  entertainments.  Without  their  assist- 
ance the  institute  would  have  accomplished  much  less  than 
it  has.     Indeed,  their  aid  has  been  most  timely  and  valuable. 

The  active  membership  of  the  aid  society  is  composed 
almost  entirely'  of  German  mothers,  who,  continuing  stead- 
fastly their  work,  have  brought  much  happiness  to  the  deaf 
children  in  the  school  and  encouragement  to  the  teachers  in 
their  arduous  labors. 

For  the  progress  which  Wisconsin  has  made  in  the  edu- 
cation of  the  deaf,  by  the  oral  method  and  establishing  pub- 
lic day  schools  for  that  purpose,  and  for  the  advanced  posi- 
tion which  she  now  occupies  in  that  respect,  she  owes  a  debt 
of  gratitude  to  the  German  mothers  of  Milwaukee  and  to  the 
ladies'  aid  society  of  the  Wisconsin  phonological  institute. 

PROF.    ADAM   STETTNER'S   SCHOOL. 

The  school  for  the  oral  instruction  of  the  deaf,  opened  and 
conducted  by  Prof.  Stettner  in  Milwaukee,  and  in  which  he 
was  assisted  in  teaching  by  his  daughter,  Mary,  and  in  the 
boarding  department  by  Mrs.  Stettner,  grew  quite  rapidly, 
until  it  numbered  twenty-four  pupils.  This  school  was  not  con- 
trolled by  the  Wisconsin  phonological  institute,  but  was  under 
its  surveillance  and  patronage.  The  chief  interest  of  the  insti- 
tute in  the  Stettner  school,  was  to  give  indigent  children  its 
advantages  and  to  promote  speech  among  the  deaf  in  Wis- 
consin and  throughout  the  country,  making  use  of  the  school 
to  some  extent  to  illustrate  the  pure  oral  method  of  teacliing 
the  deaf  as  it  exists  in  Germany. 

With  these  objects  in  view  the  institute  established'  close 
relations  with  Stettner's  school,  and  these  relations  continued 
until  the  close  of  the  school  year  1883.  Prof.  Stettner  con- 
tinued his  school  until  1884. 


6  PUBLIC    DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF   MUTES. 

For  some  time  previous  to  1883,  the  institute  had  more 
and  more  felt  the  need  of  commanding  the  services  of  the 
best  obtainable  exponent  of  its  objects,  both  in  teaching  the 
deaf  speech  and  by  speech,  in  training  teachers  of  the  deaf 
by  the  oral  method,  in  presenting  the  claims  of  the  method 
and  in  the  preparation  of  necessary  text-books.  Upon  suc- 
cess in  finding  such  a  person  the  future  of  their  undertaking 
seemed  to  depend  ;  for  without  competent  teachers  little  real 
progress  could  reasonably  be  expected. 

At  this  juncture  a  member  of  the  board,  Prof.  D.  C 
Luening,  principal  of  a  Milwaukee  public  school,  happily 
directed  attention  to  Prof.  Paul  Binner,  a  teacher  of  the  Ger- 
man language  in  the  Milwaukee  public  schools,  whose  gen- 
eral education,  special  acquirements,  experience  and  aptitudes 
pointed  him  out  as  the  man  for  the  occasion.  Accordingly 
an  arrangement  was  made  by  which  he  should  prepare  for 
the  work. 

In  August,  1883,  the  institute  engaged  the  services  of 
Paul  Binner  at  a  salary  of  $1,000  per  annum  to  devote  liis 
time  to  the  cause  of  the  oral  instruction  of  the  deaf.  Mr. 
Binner  visited  the  various  articulation  schools  in  other 
portions  of  the  country  at  the  expense  of  the  institute,  to  ob- 
serve their  methods. 

On  his  return,  by  arrangement  with  the  Milwaukee 
school  board,  a  daj'  school  for  the  deaf  children  was  opened 
in  one  of  the  public  school  buildings  by  the  Phonological 
institute,  with  Mr.  Binner  in  charge  of  the  school.  The  fol- 
lowing is  the  prospectus  of  the  school  issued  at  the  time :

MILWAUKEE     DAY     SCHOOL     FOR    THE     IlIPROVED    EDUCATIOX    OF 

DEAF-MUTE  CHILDREN,  BY  THE  PURE  ORAL  OR  GERMAN 

ARTICULATE  METHOD. 

The  board  of  directors  of  the  ^'\'isconsin  phonological  insti- 
tute for  deaf-mutes  have  the  greatest  pleasure  in  announcing 
that  on  Monday,  October  15,  1883,  they  will  open,  in  the  city  of 
Milwaukee,  a  daj-  school  for  the  improved  education  of  deaf- 
mute  children.  In  this  school  the  instruction  will  be  given  by 
the  pure  oral  or  German  articulate  method,  by  which  deaf-mutes 
learn  to  speak  and  to  read  from  the  lips.  This  method  is  the 
only  one  that  can  restore  deaf-mutes  to  an  equality  with  hear- 
ing and  speaking  people.  The  day  school  is  best  adapted  to  the 
oral  method  ;  also  to  the  general  progress  and  welfare  of  deaf- 
mutes,  because  it  gives  them  free  association  with  hearing  and 
speaking  people,  and  protects  them  against  the  evils  that  un-

avoidably  arise  from  the  constant  association  of  deaf-mut(;s  with 
deaf-mutes,  which  is  a  serious  objection  to  confining  such  chil- 
dren in  deaf-mute  asylums,  institutions  and  boarding  schools, 
as  is  now  the  general  practice. 

The  object  of  our  society  is  to  spread  the  pure  oral  or  Ger- 
man articulate  method  ;  to  procure  the  establishment  of  day 
schools  for  deaf-mutes  the  same  as  for  heariiag  childreUj  as  a 
part  of  the  public  school  system  of  the  country ;  to  prepare 
teachers  of  articulation  ;  and,  as  far  as  its  limited  means  will 
allow,  aid  indigent  deaf-mutes  to  obtain  an  education.  In  be- 
half of  these  philanthropic  objects  v.-e  confidently  appeal  to  the 
intelligence,  humanity  and  benevolence  of  the  people  of  our 
state  and  country. 

The  Milwaukee  day  school  for  deaf-mutes  will  be  in  charge 
of  Professor  Paul  Binner,  who  brings  to  the  work  intelligence 
and  enthusiasm  in  the  cause.  He  will  at  once  visit  the  best 
Eastern  schools  of  articulation  for  deaf-mutes,  with  a  view  to 
adopting  in  the  Milwaukee  school  the  best  results  of  experience. 
We  are  reluctantly  compelled,  lor  want  of  funds,  to  limit  the 
number  of  pupils  to  be  received  into  our  day  school,  and  in 
order  to  carry  it  on,  are  obliged  to  charge  tuition  to  cover  a  part 
of  the  expense  of  maintaining  it.  Tuition  per  term,  payaljle  in 
advance,  will  be  $15.  The  average  cost  to  the  society  of  the  in- 
struction will  be  about  $100  per  f)upil  per  annum.  In  eases  of 
necessity  the  board  will  make  such  deductions  from  above  rates  as 
circumstances  demand,  and  its  means  will  allow.  But  it  is  hoped 
that  no  one  will  ask  it  unless  it  should  be  necessary  to  do  so. 
It  is  also  hoped  that  patrons  of  the  school  -w-ill,  if  able  to  do  so, 
cheerfully  pay  as  large  a  part  of  the  actual  cost  of  instruction  as 
they  can,  so  that  we  may  do  more  for  those  who  need  our  aid. 

We  shall  be  happy  to  be  in  communication  with  parents 
and  guardians  of  deaf-mute  children  in  Milwaukee  and  else- 
where, who  wish  thetr  children  instructed  by  the  improved 
method;  also  with  intel'igent,  cultivated  and  high-minded  young 
gentlemen  and  ladies  "v\*ho  feel  that  they  would  like  to  become 
teachers  by  this  method.']

PUBLIC    DAY    SCHOOLS. 

March  31,  1885,  the  legislature  passed  a  bill  providing 
for  the  establishment  in  incorporated  cities  and  villages  of 


b  PUBLIC   DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR   DEAF   MUTES. 

public  day  schools  for  the  instruction  of  deaf-mutes  by 
teachers  of  approved  qualifications,  to  be  ascertained  by  the 
state  superintendent,  with  state  aid  at  |100  per  pupil  for 
nine  months'  instruction  and  in  that  ratio  for  shorter  terms. 

Under  this  law  the  Milwaukee  school  board  relieved  the 
institute  of  its  school,  which  became  a  public  day  school  and 
as  such  still  exists  and  grows. 

Under  this  law,  similar  schools  taught  by  the  oral 
method  have  been  established  by  the  school  boards  of  La 
Crosse  and  Wausau. 

NORMAL    DEPARTMENT. 

Deeply  impressed  with  the  great  necessity  for  qualified 
teachers  of  the  oral  method,  the  institute  earl}"-  turned  its 
attention  to  the  subject,  but  made  little  progress  until  it 
opened  a  day  school  of  its  own  in  1883,  when  it  earnestly 
entered  on  this  branch  of  the  work,  making  the  day  school 
3.  practice  school  for  normal  students. 

In  1887  Prof.  Binner,  at  the  expense  of  the  institute 
and  by  permission  of  the  Milwaukee  school  board,  visited 
the  oral  schools  of  Germany,  Switzerland  and  England  to 
inform  himself  of  their  methods  and  management. 

By  arrangement  made  with  the  Milwaukee  school  board 
the  normal  department  of  the  institute  was  continued  under 
Professor  Binner,  in  connection  with  the  public  day  school 
for  deaf  children,  which  was  also  used  as  a  school  of  practice 
for  normal  students. 

Tuition  in  the  normal  department  has  been  free,  and 
the  institute  has  given  financial  aid  to  the  needy  normal 
students. 

By  these  means  has  the  Milwaukee  public  school  for  the 
deaf  been  supplied  with  trained  teachers,  and  several  teach- 
ers have  also  been  supplied  to  other  schools  and  institutions 
for  the  education  of  deaf-mutes  both  iii  and  out  of  Wisconsin. 

PROPAGANDA. 

Throughout  its  history  it  has  been  the  aim  of  the  Wis- 
consin phonological  institute  to  propagate  the  pure  oral 
method  of  teaching  deaf-mutes. 

It  therefore  began  its  work  by  drawing  the  attention  of 
the  community  to  the  claims  and  advantages  of  the  method, 
enlisting  the  interest  and  securing  the  support  of  parents, 
educators,  legislators,  school  boards,  philanthropists,  business 
men  and  the  press.  The  success  attending  its  efforts  has  far 
exceeded  its  anticipations.

PUBLICATIONS. 

In  addition  to  the  several  annual  reports  issued  by  the  in- 
stitute, it  published  in  1879  a  pamphlet  on  "The  Articulate 
Method  of  Teaching  Deaf-Mutes,"  edited  by  Prof.  D.  C.  Luen- 
ing.  This  was  followed  in  1887  by  a  small  book  entitled 
"The  Dumb  Speak,"  "A  History  of  the  Education  of  the 
Deaf  and  Dumb,"  prepared  by  Prof.  Paul  Binner  and  neatly 
printed  free  of  cliarge  by  Cramer,  Aikens  &amp;  Cramer,  publish- 
ers of  the  Evening  Wisconsin. 

In  1884  it  issued  a  pamphlet  giving  briefly  the  astonish- 
ing results  of  Prof.  Alexander  Graham  Bell's  investigations 
regarding  "the  formation  of  a  deaf  variety  of  the  human 
race"  by  means  of  the  sign  language,  the  segregation  and 
seclusian  of  congenital  deaf-mutes  in  institutions,  and  conse- 
quent intermarriages  between  them.  As  a  remedy  for  this 
and  other  serious  objections  to  the  prevailing  method  of  edu- 
cating and  caring  for  deaf-mutes,  this  pamphlet  urged  the 
adoption  of  the  oral  method  and  the  establishment  of  day 
schools  in  incorporated  cities  and  villages  as  a  part  of  the 
public  school  system,  with  limited  state  aid,  and  contained  the 
form  of  a  law  for  that  purpose,  the  enactment  of  which  was 
secured.  It  contained  also  an  article  by  Prof.  Paul  Binner 
on  the  "Home  Training  of  Deaf-Mute  Children." 

LEGISLATION. 

Convinced  that  the  state  institution  for  the  deaf  at 
Delavan  was  not  in  a  condition  to  do  the  best  for  the  oral 
method  of  educating  deaf-mutes,  and  that  it  must  be  at  a  seri- 
ous disadvantage  in  that  regard,  so  long  as  signs  were  taught 
or  allowed  in  that  institution,  the  Wisconsin  plionological  in- 
stitute early  saw  that  about  all  that  could  be  done  in  the 
state  institution  was  to  encourage  more  attention  to  the  arti- 
culation teaching.  Happily  much  progress  has  been  made 
there  in  this  regard  and  will  doubtless  continue,  for  the  trend 
is  strongly  toward  the  pure  oral  method. 

It  early  became  apparent  to  the  phonological  institute, 
that,  further  provision  by  the  state  was  necessary  if  any  great 
general  improvement  was  to  be  made  in  the  treatment  and 
education  of  deaf-mutes.  Accordingly  the  subject  was 
brought  to  the  notice  of  the  governor  and  the  legislature  by 
exhibitions  of  the  pupils  of  Prof.  Stettner's  school,  which,  by 
invitation  of  the  phonological  institute,  was  visited  by  Gov- 
ernor Smith  and  committee  of  the  legislature,  the  Milwaukee 
school  board  and  the  chamber  of  commerce. 


10  PUBLIC   DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF   MUTES. 

Governor  Smith,  in  his  annual  message  to  the  legislature, 
directed  attention  to  the  subject  and  urged  its  favorable  con- 
sideration. 

At  that  time  it  was  in  contemplation  to  ask  the  slate 
to  establish  a  separate  institution,  to  be  exclusively  devoted 
to  the  oral  instruction  of  deaf-mutes,  but  this  idea  was  never 
formulated  into  a  bill  or  brought  before  the  legislature. 

About  this  time  a  bill  was  introduced  into  the  legis- 
lature by  the  late  Senator  George  H.  Paiil,  which  provided 
state  aid  of  fifteen  dollars  per  month  for  each  deaf-mute 
pupil  taught  in  any  public,  private  or  parochial  school  in  the 
state. 

The  Wisconsin  phonological  institute  believed  that  this 
measure  was  not  only  unwise  from  an  educational  point  of 
view,  but  otherwise  open  to  grave  objections,  because  it 
would  give  state  support  to  private  schools  and  institutions 
and  to  parochial  schools,  and  in  this  latter  respect  violate  the 
religious  liberties  of  the  people  by  compelling  them  to  sup- 
port, against  their  will,  religious  teachings  and  worship. 

Acting  in  accordance  with  these  views,  the  Wisconsin 
phonological  institute  remonstrated  against  the  passage  of 
the  bill  and  it  was  defeated. 

The  institute  had  now  enlisted  the  interest  of  the  Mil- 
waukee school  board  in  favor  of  its  objects,  a  committee  of 
which,  through  its  president,  Hon.  Joshua  Stark,  in  1880 
made  a  strong  report  favoring  the  oral  method  and  the  duty 
of  the  board  to  provide  instruction  for  deaf-mutes,  and  in 
favor  of  public  day  schools  for  this  purpose,  with  state  aid, 
and  eloquently  urged  the  inestimable  value  of  the  iiome  and 
the  family  to  deaf-mute  children,  the  claims  of  which  the  state 
institution  for  the  deaf  cannot  suitably  respect  and  utilize. 

In  pursuance  of  this  report,  a  committee  of  the  school 
board  was  appointed  to  prepare  a  bill  for  presentation  to  the 
legislature,  giving  authority  to  the  board  to  establish  and 
maintain  a  school  or  schools  for  the  instruction  of  deaf-mutes 
residing  in  the  city,  and  pledging  the  state  to  the  pajnnent  of 
a  fixed  sum  annually  per  pupil,  towards  the  support  of  such 
a  school. 

This  action  by  the  Milwaukee  school  board  was  sug- 
gested by  a  similar  provision  in  Massachusetts,  by  which  the 
Horace  Mann  school  for  the  deaf  in  Boston  is  sustained. 

The  bill  prepared  by  the  Milwaukee  school  board  was 
introduced  into  the  legislature  at  its  session  in  1881,  but 
failed  because  its  merits  were  not  explained  -and  understood. 


WILLIAM  E.  SMITH. 


As  Governor  of  Wisconsin  lie  favored  tlie  methods  and  measures  of  tlie  Phonological 
Institute  for  the  improved  education  and  treatment  of  deaf-mutes. 


PUBLIC    DAY   SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF    MUTES.  11 

At  the  next  session  of  the  legislature,  in  1882,  the  bill  was 
again  introduced  and  much  pains  taken  to  explain  it  to  the 
committees  to  which  it  was  referred  and  to  members.  At  the 
suggestion  of  a  member  of  the  legislature  it  was  amended  so 
as  to  make  it  general  and  apply  to  all  incorporated  cities  and 
villages.  In  this  form  it  passed  the  assembly  late  in  the  ses- 
sion, but  failed  in  the  senate  for  want  of  time. 

The  following  summer  the  national  education  associ- 
ation held  its  annual  meeting  in  Madison.  The  division  for 
deaf-mute  teachers  was  addressed  by 

PROF.  ALEXANDER  GRAHAM  BELL. 

He  strongly  advocated  the  oral  education  for  the  deaf, 
and  day  schools  for  that  purpose. 

Governor  Rusk  listened  with  close  attention  and  in  his 
next  annual  message  recommended  measures  favored  by 
the  phonological  institute  and  advocated  by  Prof.  Bell,  for 
the  improved  education  and  treatment  of  deaf-mutes. 

At  that  session  of  the  legislature  the  bill  was  again  in- 
troduced, so  modified,  however,  as  to  make  the  establishment 
of  public  day  schools  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  state 
board  of  supervision  and  state  superintendent  of  public  in- 
struction, with  a  view  to  bringing  the  state  institution  for 
the  deaf  and  day  schools  for  the  deaf  into  systematic  rela- 
tions for  the  advancement  of  deaf-mute  education. 

Prof.  Alexander  Graham  Bell  became  deeply  interested 
in  this  measure,  and,  upon  invitation  of  the  committees  on 
education  of  the  senate  and  assembly,  came  from  Washing- 
ton to  Madison,  where  he  spent  two  weeks  explaining  it  to 
the  legislature  and  urging  its  passage.  On  leaving  Madi- 
son, he  placed  in  the  hands  of  each  member  of  the  legis- 
lature the  following  open  letter  to  the  committees  on  educa- 
tion of  the  senate  and  assembly,  setting  forth  his  views  regard- 
ing the  merits  of  the  bill : 

AN   OPEN   LETTER   CONCERNING   THE    BILL   RELATING    TO    THE    IN- 
STRUCTION  OF   DEAF-MUTES   IN   INCORPORATED 
CITIES   AND   VILLAGES. 

Madison,  Wis.,  Feb.  18th,  1885. 

To  the  committees    on    education    of  the  senate  and  assembly   of 
the  legislature  of  Wisconsin  : 

Gentlemen:  His  Excellency,  Governor  Rusk,  in  his  recent 
message  to  the  legislature,  has  called  attention  to  the  large  num- 
ber of  deaf  children  in  the  state  who  are  growing  up  in  igno- 
rance, and  to  the  fact  that  the  provision  made  for  their  education 


12  PUBLIC   DAY    SCHOOLS   FOR    DEAF    MUTES. 

is  yet  inadequate.  In  1880,  according  to  the  recent  census,  there 
were  in  the  state  of  Wisconsin  1,079  deaf-miites,  of  whom  600 
were  from  six  to  twenty  years  of  age.  The  total  number  of  deaf- 
mutes  returned  as  then  in  school  was  only  199.  The  following 
facts  show  that  the  means  adopted  by  the  other  states  have  also 
failed  to  bring  under  instruction  a  large  number  of  the  deaf- 
mutes  of  school  age.  (This  age  is  assumed  in  the  census  returns  to 
be  frofn  six  to  twenty  years.)  Out  of  a  total  of  33,878  deaf-mutes 
in  the  United  States  in  1880,  15,059  were  of  school  age  ;  and  the 
total  number  of  deaf-mutes  returned  as  then  in  the  institutions 
and  schools  of  the  United  States  was'only  5,893.  It  is  obvious 
that  the  best  means  of  reaching  and  bringing  under  instruction 
the  uneducated  deaf  children  of  the  country  is  a  subject  demand- 
ing immediate  and  serious  attention.  The  bill  you  are  now  dis- 
cussing, relating  to  the  instruction  of  deaf-mutes  in  incorporated 
cities  and  villages,  touches  this  question. 

It  has  given  me  great  pleasure  to  respond  to  your  cordial  in- 
vitation to  participate  in  your  deliberations,  and  I  think  I  would 
be  wanting  in  my  duty  to  the  deaf,  to  whose  interests  I  have 
given  so  many  years  of  earnest  thought,  were  I  to  leave  ^^'iscon- 
sin  without  placing  in  your  hands,  in  some  permanent  form,  the 
views  I  have  attempted  to  express  to  you  orally. 

The  moment  my  attention  was  directed  to  the  bill  now 
under  consideration,  I  recognized  the  fact  that  a  new  phase  of 
legislation  for  the  benefit  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  had  been  reached, 
of  vast  importance  to  the  deaf  and  to  society.  The  bill  rej^re- 
sents  the  first  attempt  that  has  been  made  in  the  United  States 
to  embody,  in  the  form  of  a  law,  a  principle  of  dealing  with  the 
deaf  and  dumb  that  has  long  been  seen  to  be  advisable  from  a 
theoretical  point  of  view;  and  the  example  of  Wisconsin  will  un- 
doubtedly be  speedily  followed  by  other  states.  The  principle 
involved  may  be  tersely  described  as  the  policy  of  decentraliza- 
tion, the  policy  of  keeping  deaf-mutes  separated  from  one  an- 
other as  much  as  possible  during  the  period  of  education,  and 
in  contact  as  much  as  possible  with  hearing  and  speaking  chil- 
dren ol  their  own  age.  The  difficulty  hitherto  has  been  how  to 
accomplish  this.  The  proposed  bill  promises  a  partial  solution 
of  the  problem,  and  is  an  important  step  in  advance. 

When  the  subject  of  the  education  of  the  deaf  first  engaged 
the  attention  of  the  legislature,  the  state  was  thinly  populated, 
and  deaf-mutes  were  few  in  number.  Thej'  were  so  scattered 
throughout  the  state  that  the  only  practicable  method  of  reach- 
ing them  appeared  to  be  to  collect  them  together  into  one  school. 
This  policy  of  centralization  had  also,  up  to  that  time,  been  uni- 
formly adopted  bj^  the  older  states.  In  pursuance  of  this  policy, 
it  became  necessary  to  remove  the  children  from  their  homes  in 
order  to  instruct  them,  and  this  forced  the  state  to  assume  the 
cost   of  support   as   well   as  tuition.     Dormitories  and  special 


PUBLIC   DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF    MUTES.  13 

school  buildings  were  erected,  and  in  1852  the  Wisconsin  insti- 
tution for  the  education  of  the  deaf  was  opened  at  Delavan.  A 
few  years  ago  the  buildings  were  destroyed  by  fire,  and  in  1880 
the  institution  was  rebuilt,  with  increased  accommodations.  The 
institution  is  now  comfortably  well  filled  ;  but  the  returns  of  the 
census  show,  that,  even  if  crowded  to  its  utmost  capacity,  it 
could  not  accommodate  one-half  of  the  deaf-mutes  of  school  age 
in  the  state.  It  is  now  necessary  to  consider  what  additional 
facilities  should  be  provided.  Shall  the  Delavan  institution  be 
enlarged  ?  Shall  a  new  institution  be  erected  in  another  part  ol 
the  state  ?  Or,  shall  schools  of  a  different  kind  be  established  ? 
The  promoters  of  the  bill  propose  a  new  departure. 

They  believe  that  in  many  of  the  incorporated  cities  and  vil- 
lages of  Wisconsin  the  deaf  children  could,  with  limited  state  aid, 
be  educated  in  the  localities  where  they  reside.  By  the  passage 
of  the  bill  the  state  will  offer  facilities  for  the  establishment  ol 
small  day  schools  for  deaf  children  wherever  the  parents  desire 
to  keep  them  at  home  during  the  period  of  instruction.  This 
desire,  I  am  sure,  is  very  general;  and  it  is  to  be  feared  that  in 
many  cases  the  struggle  between  parental  affection  and  the  good 
of  the  child  results  in  the  retention  of  the  child  at  home  instead 
of  sending  it  to  school.  By  sending  the  teachers  to  the  children, 
instead  of  the  children  to  the  teachers,  wherever  possible,  the 
state  will  accommodate  its  policy  to  the  wishes  of  parents,  and 
bring  comfort  and  happiness  to  many  an  afflicted  family.  The 
state,  also,  will  be  benefited  by  having  deaf  children  brought 
under  educational  influences  who  would  not  otherwise,  without 
compulsion,  be  sent  to  an  institution,  or  who  would  enter  school 
so  late  in  life  as  to  receive  but  little  benefit  from  the  course  of 
instruction. 

It  is  now  well  known  that  those  whom  we  term  "deaf- 
mutes"  have  no  other  natural  defect  save  that  of  deafaess.  They 
are  simply  persons  who  are  deaf  from  childhood,  and  many  of 
them  are  only  hard  of  hearing.  The  lack  of  articulate  speech 
which  has  led  to  their  denomination  as  "mutes"  results  from 
lack  of  instruction,  and  not  from  any  defect  of  the  vocal  organs. 
No  one  naturally  acquires  without  instruction  a  language  he  has 
never  heard.  But,  if  children  who  are  born  deaf  or  hard  of  hear- 
ing do  not  naturally  speak,  how,  then,  do  they  think  ?  It  is 
difficult  for  us  to  realize  the  possibility  of  a  train  of  thought 
carried  on  without  words ;  but  what  words  can  a  deaf  child 
know  who  has  never  heard  the  sounds  of  speech?  What 
we  think,  we  think  in  Words,  though  we  may  not  actually 
utter  sounds.  Let  us  eliminate  from  our  consciousness  the 
train  of  words,  and  what  remains  ?  I  do  not  venture  to 
answer  the  question  ;  but  it  is  this,  and  this  alone,  that  belongs 
to  the  thoughts  of  a  deaf  child.  Even  written  words,  as  found 
in  books  and  periodicals,  though  appealing  to  a  sense  possessed

by  the  deaf  child,  mean  no  more  to  him  ^vithout  instruction 
than  a  Russian  or  Chinese  book  would  mean  to  us.  ^\^ho,  then, 
can  picture  the  profound  depth  of  the  ignorance  of  the  unedu- 
cated deaf-mute  ?  If  you  would  try  to  realize  the  black  dark- 
ness of  his  mind,  consider  what  your  mental  condition  would 
be  were  you  to  wipe  out  from  your  memory  everything  you 
have  ever  heard  of  and  everything  you  have  read.  Naturally 
intelligent,  the  deaf  child  looks  out  upon  the  world  and  longs 
for  knowledge.  Common  humanity  demands  that  we  use  ever}' 
means — even  to  compulsion — to  bring  under  instruction  the  deaf 
children  of  Wisconsin.  Upon  other  grounds  also  the  education 
of  deaf  children  is  a  matter  of  importance ;  for  deaf-mutes,  if 
allowed  to  grow  up  without  instruction,  have  all  the  passions  of 
men  and  women,  without  the  restraining  influences  that  spring 
from  a  cultivated  understanding. 

Under  the  enlightening  influences  of  education  they  become 
good  citizens,  amenable  to  the  laws  of  society,  and  able  to  exer- 
cise the  franchise  intelligently.  As  deafness  is  not  necessarily  a 
bar  to  intellectual  culture,  some  are  found  capable  of  the  very 
highest  education.  This  has  been  recognized  by  Congress  by 
the  establishment  of  the  national  college  for  deaf-mutes,  at  A\'ash- 
ington,  which  is  open  to  the  deaf-mutes  of  Wisconsin.  To  show 
the  intellectual  condition  they  can  assume,  I  may  state  that  a 
number  in  this  country  support  themselves  by  literature.  Some 
are  editors,  and  contributors  to  the  magazines  and  daily  journals. 
Two  deaf-mute  brothers  in  Belleville,  Ontario,  are  successful 
lawyers.  There  are  very  few  positions  in  life  which  cannot  be 
occupied  by  deaf  persons.  Nearly  all  the  arts  and  industries 
are  open  to  them,  and  many  of  the  professions.  Even  when 
uneducated  they  are  rarely  a  burden  upon  the  communit\' ;  for 
deafness  is  no  bar  to  physical  labor.  Indeed,  it  is  to  be  feared 
that  deaf-mutes  are  sometimes  deprived  of  education  on  account 
of  the  value  of  their  labor  at  home.  By  education,  deaf-mutes 
are  raised  from  a  condition  of  mental  degradation  that  is  abso- 
lutely inconceivable,  and  from  a  social  position  but  little  re- 
moved from  slavery,  to  become  intelligent  and  valuable  mem- 
bers of  society,  and  sources  of  wealth  to  the  state. 

Success  in  the  education  of  the  deaf  and  dumb  depends 
on  the  possibility  of  teaching  them  a  language  whereliy  ideas 
may  be  imparted  and  the  mind  cultivated.  But  it  is  in  ver}' 
early  childhood  that  language  is  most  easily  acquired.  By 
adopting  a  policy  of  centralization  the  state  has  rendered  it  im- 
possible to  bring  deaf  children  under  instruction  until  after  the 
most  impressionable  period  of  life  has  been  passed,  ^^'isconsin, 
in  her  constitution,  defines  the  school  age  of  her  children  as  from 
four  to  twenty  years  ;  but  deaf  children,  to  whom  education  is 
so  vitally  important,  cannot  enter  your  institution  until  they 
reach  the  age  of  ten .  Why  should  deaf  children  be  debarred  from 
the  benefits  guaranteed  to  all  by  the  constitution  itself?

The  nearer  the  school  can  be  brought  to  the  home  the  ear- 
lier can  instruction  be  profitably  commenced.  Little  day  schools 
scattered  throughout  the  state  will  meet  a  want  that  is  sorely 
felt.  The  necessary  smallness  of  the  schools  will  be  an  element 
in  promoting  their  efficiency.  Under  equal  circumstances  of 
instruction  the  pupils  of  small  schools  make  greater  progress 
than  those  of  large  ones,  because  the  teacher  can  give  more  in- 
dividual attention  to  the  children. 

Another  advantage  of  the  small  day  school  is  the  influence 
on  the  home  surroundings  exerted  by  the  teacher.  There  is  no 
one  so  capable  of  instructing  a  little  child  as  its  own  mother  ; 
but  parents,  as  a  rule,  are  utterly  ignorant  of  all  matters  con- 
nected with  the  education  of  the  deaf.  The  proximity  of  the 
home  and  school  must  lead  to  frequent  personal  contact  between 
the  parents  and  teacher.  Information  will  be  sought  and  given, 
and  in  many  cases  the  parents  and  family  will  be  brought  to  co- 
operate intelligently  in  the  work  of  instruction. 

The  bill  contemplates  making  the  day  schools  for  the  deaf  a 
part  of  the  general  public  school  system  of  the  state,  and  school- 
rooms will  be  provided  by  the  incorporated  cities  and  villages  in 
which  such  schools  are  opened.  As  a  very  small  school-room  will 
accommodate  as  many  deaf  children  as  one  teacher  can  profit- 
ably instruct,  economical  and  other  considerations  will  usually 
lead  to  the  selection  of  a  room  in  some  building  already  occupied 
as  a  public  school,  and  thus  the  deaf  children  will  be  brought 
into  close  proximity  to  large  numbers  of  hearing  children  in  the 
same  building.  This  proximity  will  favor  the  growth  of  friend- 
ships between  the  deaf  and  the  hearing  pupils,  which  will  be 
invaluable  in  adult  life,  leading  to  business  and  social  relations 
of  the  greatest  importance.  Constant  association  with  hearing 
and  speaking  children  will  accustom  the  deaf  child  to  the  society 
in  which  he  is  to  live  in  the  future.  His  hearing  school-fellows 
and  playmates  will  be  the  men  and  Avomen  by  whom  he  will 
be  surrounded  in  adult  life.  How  important,  then,  that  deaf- 
mutes  should  have  the  opportunity  of  cultivating  the  acquaint- 
ance of  hearing  persons  of  their  own  age.  The  friendships  formed 
in  childhood  often  last  through  life.  Living  constantly  in  the 
midst  of  the  industries  and  activities  of  the  communities  in 
which  they  have  interested  personal  friends  to  encourage  and  aid 
them,  the  ways  are  open  to  them  to  acquire  any  trade,  business, 
or  profession  for  which  they  have  aptness  or  inclination.  The 
broad  fields  and  avenues  of  life  invite  them  as  they  do  the  hear- 
ing ;  whereas,  in  institutions  they  are  limited  to  a  few  mechan- 
ical trades  merely,  not  so  easily  turned  to  account  for  want  of 
that  personal  acquaintance  so  helpful  in  obtaining  desirable 
employment.  Furthermore,  industrial  education  is  being 
brought  into  the  educational  systems  of  the  large  towns,  afford-

ing  advantages  of  a  broader  and  more  thorough  kind  than  insti- 
tutions offer. 

Every  means  that  will  bring  the  deaf  child  into  closer  as- 
sociation and  affiliation  with  hearing  children  of  his  own  age 
will  promote  his  happiness  and  success  in  adult  life.  Associ- 
ation in  the  games  and  plays  of  hearing  children  will  be  an  im- 
portant element  in  bringing  this  about.  Partial  co-education 
with  the  hearing  children  of  the  public  schools  will  also  be  of  use. 
Partial  co-education  is  not  only  perfectly  feasible,  but  will  be  of  ad- 
vantage to  the  deaf  child,  and  a  means  of  economizing  the  time  of 
the  special  teacher.  Deaf  children  require  a  great  deal  of  individual 
instruction,  especially  in  the  early  steps  of  education.  Some  ot 
the  brightest  children  can  be  withdrawn  from  the  special  school- 
room for  short  periods  of  time,  with  advantage  to  the  duller 
pupils,  who  could  then  receive  the  individual  attention  of  the 
specially  skilled  teacher.  There  are  subjects  taught  in  the  public 
schools  in  which  information  is  gained  through  the  eye,  and  in 
such  branches  deaf  children  could  profitably  enter  the  same 
classes  with  the  hearing ;  for  instance,  they  could  join  the  classes 
for  practice  in  writing,  drawing,  and  arithmetic  from  the  black- 
boards and  on  the  slate,  map  drawing,  sewing,  etc.  For  other 
subjects,  special  methods  of  instruction  would  be  necessary, 
especially  in  the  earlier  stages,  and  this  necessitates  the  emploj'- 
ment  ot  a  special  teacher  and  school-room. 

I  have  no  doubt  that  some  of  the  brighter  pupils  might 
ultimately  be  able  to  dispense  with  the  special  teacher  altogether, 
as  cases  are  known  in  the  United  States  where  deaf  children 
have  successfully  taken  the  full  course  in  the  public  school,  and 
graduated  with  honor  to  themselves  and  their  teachers.  It  must 
be  remembered,  however,  that  these  are  exceptional  cases;  and, 
while  they  show  the  possibility  of  complete  co-education  in  some 
cases,  the  experience  of  the  past  has  demonstrated  the  impos- 
sibility of  this  in  the  great  majority  of  cases. 

The  pOwer  of  speech  and  reading  speech  from  the  mouth 
would  evidently  be  of  the  greatest  assistance  in  establishing  com- 
munication between  deaf  and  hearing  children.  Constant  as- 
sociation with  hearing  and  speaking  children  will  act  as  a  stimu- 
lus to  the  acquisition  of  speech,  which  stimulus  is  wanting  in  an 
institution  where  all  the  playmates  and  associates  are  deaf,  and 
where  some  of  the  teachers  themselves  cannot  hear.  It  is  well 
know  to  all  instructors  of  the  deaf,  that,  in  other  countries  than 
our  own,  deaf-mutes  are  taught  to  speak,  and  that  international 
conventions  of  teachers  of  the  deaf  have  decided  that  speech  and 
speech  reading  should  be  taught  to  all  deaf-mutes',  as  a  regular 
branch  of  their  education.  That  this  is  not  more  done  in 
America  is  due  to  many  causes,  among  the  most  important  being 
the  extraordinary  ignorance  of  the  American  people  concerning 
the  mechanism  of  speech,  and  the  consequent  difficulty  in  ob- 


PUBLIC   DAY    SCHOOLS   EOE   DEAF   MUTES.  17 

taining  competent  articulation  teachers.  I  doubt  whether  one 
person  in  ten  thousand  could  give  an  intelligible  account  of  the 
movements  of  his  mouth  in  uttering  the  simplest  sentence.  In- 
deed, so  gross  is  the  popular  ignorance  of  the  whole  subject  that, 
when  a  deaf-mute  is  taught  to  speak,  people  look  upon  it  as  a 
sort  of  miracle,  and  few  persons  seem  to  be  aware  that  what  is 
here  regarded  as  a  miracle  is  in  other  countries  an  everyday  fact. 
All  the  deaf-mutes  of  Germany  are  taught  to  speak.  In  fact,  so 
general  is  instruction  of  this  kind  that  in  1882  more  than  sixty- 
five  per  cent,  of  the  deaf-mutes  under  instruction  in  the  world, 
outside  the  shores  of  America,  were  taught  to  speak  and  under- 
stand the  speech  of  others  in  purely  oral  schools.  Inside  our 
shores  less  than  nine  per  cent,  were  to  be  found  in  oral  schools. 
In  most  of  our  institutions,  however,  though  they  may  not  be 
classed  as  oral  schools,  speech  is  taught  to  a  selected  few  of  the 
pupils.  The  latest  statistics  on  this  subject  show  that  in  May, 
1883,  fourteen  per  cent,  of  the  deaf-mutes  of  America  were  using 
speech  in  the  school-room  as  the  means  of  communication  with 
their  teacher,  eighteen  per  cent,  were  taught  to  speak  as  an  ac- 
complishment, and  sixty-eight  per  cent,  received  no  instruction 
whatever  in  articulation.  In  view  of  the  lamentable  neglect  of 
articulation  teaching  in  this  country,  it  is  encouraging  to  know 
that  of  the  deaf-mutes  in  the  institutions  and  day  schools  of  the 
New  England  states,  more  than  fifty-four  per  cent,  are  taught  to 
speak. 

In  the  light  of  the  great  success  of  articulation  teaching  in 
Germany,  the  following  fact  is  significant:  I  am  informed  that 
in  that  country  instruction  in  the  mechanism  of  speech  and  the 
anatomy  of  the  vocal  organs  forms  a  part  of  the  regular  curricu- 
lum of  the  normal  schools.  Courses  of  lectures  are  also  given 
on  the  methods  of  teaching  defective  children.  It  then  becomes 
easy  to  select  from  the  normal  schools  suitable  persons  for  teach- 
ers of  the  deaf  and  dumb.  Such  persons  require  a  thorough 
knowledge  of  the  theory  and  art  of  teaching  and  of  the  mechan- 
ism of  speech.  Then,  with  a  limited  amount  of  practical  ex- 
perience in  a  school  for  the  deaf  under  the  superintendence  of 
an  experienced  principal,  they  are  qualified  for  their  work. 

Such  a  plan  is  perfectly  feasible  in  Wisconsin,  and  is 
viewed  with  favor,  I  understand,  by  the  state  superintendent. 
A  general  knowledge  of  the  mechanism  of  speech  will  be  of  value 
to  the  teachers  of  your  public  schools  on  account  of  the  large 
number  of  children  of  foreign-born  parents  in  your  schools.  If 
you  would  preserve  the  purity  of  the  English  tongue  in  Wiscon- 
sin, you  must  teach  speech  to  the  pupils  of  the  public  schools, 
and  this  involves  a  knowledge  of  the  mechanism  of  speech  on 
the  part  of  the  teachers.  Should  the  subject  of  the  mechanism 
of  speech  receive  attention  in  your  normal  schools,  there  will  be 
no  difficulty  in  selecting  fi-om  the  students  persons  who  show

special  natural  abilities  for  articulation  work,  to  become  the 
teachers  in  the  small  day  schools  for  deaf  children  to  be  estab- 
lished under  the  provisions  of  the  bill.  Let  the  bill  be  passed, 
and  a  demand  will  arise  for  the  schools.  This  will  create  a  de- 
mand for  teachers,  and  the  demand  will  lead  to  a  suppty, 

The  promoters  of  this  bill  have  wisely  abstained  from  re- 
stricting in  any  way  the  methods  of  instruction  to  be  used  in 
the  schools.  The  measure  expresses  a  willingness  on  the  part 
of  the  state  to  accommodate  its  policy  to  the  wishes  of  the  par- 
ents of  deaf  children  to  retain  them  at  home ;  and,  in  pursu- 
ance of  this  spirit  of  accommodation,  the  bill  leaves  the  parents 
and  local  authorities  some  liberty  of  choice  regarding  methods 
of  instruction.  When  the  most  experienced  teachers  are  divided 
as  to  the  value  of  the  ditferent  methods  of  instruction,  who  is 
competent  to  decide  ?  The  state  may  rest  assured,  that,  when 
the  interests  of  their  afflicted  children  are  at  stake,  the  parents 
will  be  apt  to  make  a  careful  choice.  The  state  is  secured 
against  rash  experiments  of  a  doubtful  nature  by  the  general 
control  to  be  exercised  over  all  the  schools  by  the  state  super- 
intendent and  the  state  board  of  supervision,  who  also  control 
the  operations  of  the  Delavan  institution.  By  this  provision 
also  the  harmonious  relations  of  the  small  day  schools  to  the 
central  institution  are  guaranteed. 

It  is  to  me  a  matter  of  regret  that  the  amount  of  the  state 
aid  should  have  been  limited  to  $100  per  annum  for  each  child 
instructed;  for  it  is  obvious  that  the  higher  the  limit  fixed  bj- 
the  state  the  more  will  it  be  possible  to  extend  the  benefits  of 
the  measure  into  the  smaller  centres  of  population.  To  my 
mind,  the  limit  should  ultimately  be  fixed  at  that  amount, 
whatever  it  may  be,  which  represents  the  average  per  capita 
cost  at  the  state  institution.  I  believe,  however,  that  the 
amount  of  $100  per  annum  is  sufficient  to  test  the  operations  of 
the  plan.  Experience  will  show  how  far  the  measure  fulfills  the 
expectations  of  its  promoters,  and  if  successful  the  state  can 
then  consider  what  further  increase  of  state  aid  may  be  advis- 
able or  necessary. 

Each  centre  of  instruction,  established  under  the  provisions 
of  the  bill,  will  radiate  an  influence  into  the  surrounding 
country  districts,  and  tend  to  attract  into  the  schools  deaf-mutes 
from  these  districts.  In  this  way  many  deaf-mutes  in  rural  dis- 
tricts may  be  reached  whose  parents  Avould  object  to  send  their 
children  far  away  from  home  to  the  state  institution.  It  may 
also  be  possible,  under  the  provisions  of  the  bill,  to  establish  a 
school  in  an  incorporated  village  where  there  may  not  be  a  suffi- 
cient number  of  deaf  children  to  support  a  teacher,  by  collect- 
ing into  that  centre  a  suflicient  number  of  children  from  the 
surrounding  country.  The  nearer  the  school  approaches  to  the 
home  of  a  child  the  less  likelihood  is  there  that  he  will  escape 


PUBLIC    DAY    SCHOOLS   FOR    DEAF    MUTES.  19 

instruction.  Little  by  little,  as  the  measure  is  put  into  opera- 
tion, new  centres  of  instruction  will  arise,  each  radiating  its 
influence  into  the  neighboring  places,  so  that  ultimately  the 
benefits  of  the  bill  will  reach  into  every  nook  and  corner  of 
the  state. 

The  multiplication  of  small  schools  upon  diverse  plans 
renders  it  possible  for  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  the  country 
to  settle  by  a  natural  process  the  disputed  ]:)oints  concerning 
the  education  of  the  deaf.  A  single  state  school  with  an  estab- 
lished method  of  intruction,  like  an  established  religion,  tends 
to  intolerance.  A  number  of  small  schools  depending  for  life 
upon  the  results  produced  is  favorable  to  progress.  It  should 
be  the  duty  of  the  state  superintendent  and  state  board  of 
supervision  to  keep  careful  note  of  the  processes  employed  in 
the  various  schools  ;  and  it  should  also  be  their  duty  to  collect 
statistics  that  would  demonstrate  the  influence  of  the  methods 
of  instruction  upon  the  after  lives  of  the  pupils.  Then  we  may 
expect  progress,  and  the  state  of  Wisconsin  will  point  the  way 
for  the  other  states  to  follow. 

In  the  above  argument  I  have  attempted  to  show: 

1.  That  the  operation  of  the  bill  is  calculated  to  bring 
under  instruction  a  larger  number  of  the  uneducated  deaf  chil- 
dren of  the  state  than  would  be  possible  on  the  institution  plan. 

2.  That  their  instruction  may  be  commenced  at  an  earlier 
age  than  has  heretofore  been  practicable. 

3.  That  by  her  constitution  Wisconsin  is  pledged  to  offer 
the  benefits  of  education  to  all  her  children  between  the  ages  of 
four  and  twenty  years,  and  that  in  the  case  of  the  deaf  she  can- 
not fulfill  this  obligation,  excepting  upon  some  such  plan  as  that 
provided  for  in  the  bill. 

4.  That  the  conditions  created  by  the  bill  are  eminently 
favorable  to  the  cultivation  of  speech  and  speech  reading,  and 

5.  That  the  conditions  are  also  favorable  to  the  growth  of 
improvements  in  the  methods  of  instruction. 

In  conclusion  allow  me  to  express  my  earnest  and  heartfelt 
desire  that  you  may  see  fit  to  recommend  to  the  legislature  the 
passage  of  this  bill,  which,  in  my  opinion,  is  destined  to  confer 
untold  blessings  on  the  deaf  and  upon  society. 

I  am,  gentlemen,  yours  very  respectfully, 

Alexander  Graham  Bell. 

Although  the  legislature  hesitated  regarding  so  radical 
an  innovation,  the  bill  became  a  law  March  31,  1885. 
Thus  originated  what  is  now  pointed  to  and  known  as  "the 
Wisconsin  system,"  considered  a  model  for  other  states  in 
providing  lor  the  education  of  deaf-mutes. 


20  PUBLIC   DAY   SCHOOLS   FOR   DEAF   MUTES. 

MISS    DAISY   WAY  AND  HER  MOTHER. 

These  two  ladies  greatly  assisted  the  phonological  in- 
stitute ill  advancing  its  objects  and  most  opportunely  in 
securiijg  the  passage  of  the  law  that  has  placed  Wisconsin  in 
advance  of  other  states  in  the  education  of  deaf-mutes. 

Sickness  deprived  Miss  Way  of  hearing  at  the  age  of  five 
years  and  with  it  she  lost  her  speech.  She  was  an  only  and 
very  bright  and  beautiful  child.  He  mother  went  with  her 
to  Mystic,  Connecticut,  where  she  was  placed  in  the  Whipple 
school  of  articulation  for  the  deaf. 

At  the  end  of  one  year  she  returned  to  her  home  in  Cres- 
ton,  Iowa,  under  a  private  teacher  of  articulation  a  year, 
after  which  she  was  taught  by  her  mother.  She  entered  the 
public  school  in  classes  with  hearing  children,  successfully 
completed  the  course  and  graduated  with  honor  from  the 
high  school,  reading  in  public  an  original  essay. 

Her  father  having  lost  his  property  and  health,  it  was 
necessary  for  her  to  fit  herself  for  self-support.  With  this 
object  in  view  she  came  to  Milwaukee  to  take  a  course  in  a 
business  college,  which  she  accomplished  with  marked  suc- 
cess, and  soon  thereafter  accepted  a  responsible  position  in  a 
large  financial  institution  in  Kansas  City,  which  she  still 
occupies. 

Miss  Way  and  her  mother  spent  the  winter  of  1884^5  in 
Milwaukee  at  a  time  when  such  intelligent,  accomplished  and 
enthusiastic  representatives  of  the  oral  method  were  most 
needed. 

They  immediately  became  a  center  of  attraction  and 
around  them  gathered  not  only  the  large  circle  comprised  in 
the  phonological  institute  and  ladies'  auxiliarj^  society,  but 
many  others. 

Miss  Way's  winning  manner  and  interesting  conversa- 
tion drew  about  her  the  most  cultivated  people,  and  she  be- 
came a  social  favorite.  Both  she  and  her  mother  were  so 
deeply  interested  in  favor  of  the  oral  method  of  educating 
the  deaf,  that  they  were  more  than  anxious  to  lend  their  aid 
for  its  advancement.  While  in  Milwaukee  her  frequent 
visits  to  the  day  school  for  the  oral  instruction  of  the  deaf 
were  a  source  of  encouragement  and  inspiration.  They 
thoroughly  believed  in  small  day  schools  for  the  oral  in- 
struction of  the  deaf,  and  in  this  behalf  they  went  to  Madison 
to  urge  the  passage  of  the  bill  providing  for  day  schools  for 
the  deaf  in  incorporated  cities  and  villages  as  a  part  of  the 


MISS  DAISY  M.  WAY. 


PUBLIC    DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF    MUTES.  21 

public  school  system.  In  her  own  person,  Miss  Way  was  an 
excellent  example  of  the  benefit  that  might  be  expected 
from  such  a  measure,  both  to  pupils  and  teachers. 

The  presence  of  Miss  Way  and  her  mother  in  Madison 
was  announced,  and  members  of  the  legislature,  friends  of 
education  and  citizens  called  upon  them.  Miss  Way's  fluent 
speech,  intelligence  and  grace  surprised  and  captivated  legis- 
lators and  others,  and  so  many  hearts  were  touched  and 
minds  opened  that  it  became  comparatively  easy  to  get  tlie 
merits  of  the  bill  for  the  day  schools  for  the  deaf  considered. 
Miss  Way  and  her  mother  had  helped  to  prepare  the  way  for 
Prof.  Alexander  Graham  Bell  and  his  powerful  advocacy  of 
the  measure,  the  adoption  of  which  has  already  done  much 
for  the  benefit  of  the  deaf-mutes  of  Wisconsin  and  is  des- 
tined to  confer  untold  blessings  upon  such  children  in  other 
states  as  well,  for  whose  education  and  prospects  in  life  it 
marks  a  new  and  better  era  in  the  progress  of  deaf-mute 
education. 

STATISTICS  OF  DAY  SCHOOLS. 

There  are  now  in  operation  in  Wisconsin  three  public 
day  schools  for  the  deaf,  all  by  the  oral  method,  located  as 
follows : 

One  in  Milwaukee,  with  forty-two  pupils,  a  principal 
and  five  class  teachers  assisted  by  five  normal  students.  One 
in  Wausau,  with  five  pupils  and  one  teacher.  One  in  La 
Crosse,  with  eight  pupils  and  one  teacher.  Total  number  of 
pupils  fifty-five.    A  school  will  be  opened  in  Manitowoc  soon. 

Steps  are  being  taken  to  establish  an  oral  public  day 
school  in  Manitowoc.  In  view  of  the  special  qualifications 
required  and  the  exhausting  character  of  the  work,  the  Mil- 
waukee school  board  pays  teachers  in  the  oral  school  for  the 
deaf  $100  per  annum  more  than  it  pays  class  teachers  of  hear- 
ing children. 

The  same  course  of  studies  is  pursued  in  the  school  for 
the  deaf  as  in  hearing  schools. 

By  the  rules  of  the  board  ten  pupils  constitute  the  mini- 
mum for  a  class,  but  experience  has  shown  that  the  number 
is  too  large,  and  that  classes  of  five  are  large  enough  when 
taught  by  the  oral  method  and  that  smaller  classes  are 
preferable. 

NORMAL   DEPARTMENT. 

The  normal  department  of  the  Wisconsin  phonological 
institute  has  trained  twenty-two  teachers  by  the  oral  method. 


22  PUBLIC    DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF    MUTES. 

They  have  come  from  various  parts  of  the  country,  as  fol- 
lows: Milwaukee  9,  Chicago  1,  Iowa  1,  Boston,  Mass.,  1, 
Portland,  Me.,  1,  New  York  state  2,  New  York  city  1,  West 
Virginia  1,  Wausau,  Wis.,  2,  Washington  county.  Wis.,  1, 
La  Crosse,  Wis.,  1.,  Canada  1.  Eight  had  taught  in  liearing 
scliools  before  entering  this  work,  and  one  had  taught  six 
years  in  a  day  school  for  the  oral  instruction  of  the  deaf. 

GRADUATES. 

Graduates  from  the  day  school  for  the  deaf  in  Milwau- 
kee, have  experienced  little  difficulty  in  finding  opportuni- 
ties to  learn  such  trades  as  they  prefer.  One  has  entered  the 
public  high  school  in  classes  with  hearing  pupils,  and  one  is 
pursuing  a  course  in  a  business  college  with  the  intention  of 
taking  charge  of  her  father's  books  and  counting-room  in  a 
large  manufacturing  business.  They  are  excellent  lip  read- 
ers and  speak  quite  well,  although  one  has  a  partial  facial 
paralysis  and  the  other  suffers  from  catarrhal  troubles  that 
affect  her  speech.    .They  are  both  semi-mutes. 

PREPARATION    OF   TEXT-BOOKS. 

The  need  of  text-books  and  manuals  for  students  and 
teachers  of  articulation  has  received  the  attention  of  the 
phonological  institute.  To  supply  that  want  they  engaged 
the  services  of  Prof.  Paul  Binner,  who  began  several  years 
ago  the  preparation  of  works  on  the  "Anatomy  of  the  Or- 
gans of  Speech,"  "Physiology  of  the  Elements  of  Speech" 
and  "  Special  Pedagogy  for  Teachers  of  the  Deaf." 

These  works,  in  manuscript,  comprising  the  lectures  of 
Prof.  Binner  to  the  normal  students,  have  been  in  use  in  the 
normal  department  of  the  institute  some  time  experiment- 
ally and  proved  to  be  well  adapted  to  the  purpose  for  which 
they  were  intended. 

The  publication  of  these  books  was  delayed  until  a  con- 
venient time  for  the  institute  to  defray  the  expense,  as  pub- 
lishers could  not  be  obtained  on  account  of  the  probable 
small  demand. 

The  manuscripts  were,  during  the  past  summer,  put  in 
the  hands  of  leading  oralists  for  examination. 

During  the  progress  of  the  examination  they  found  that 
Dr.  Thomas  Arnold,  of  the  oral  scliool  for  the  deaf,  North 
Hampton,  England,  had  recently  published  a  book  covering 
much  the  same  ground  in  such  a  manner  as  they  then 
thought  rendered  the  publication  of  Prof.  Binner's  books 
unnecessary. 


PUBLIC    DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF    MUTES.  23 

From  the  preface  of  Dr.  Arnold's  book  it  appears  that  it 
was  suggested  in  1886,  while  Prof.  Binner  began  his  work 
much  earlier. 

It  thus  appears  that  Prof.  Paul  Binner  in  America  and 
Dr.  Thomas  Arnold  in  England,  were  each  working  inde- 
pendently along  the  same  lines  without  the  knowledge  of  the 
other. 

From  a  more  thorough  comparison  of  Dr.  Arnold's  book 
with  Prof.  Binner's  manuscript  it  appears  that  the  former 
does  not  adequately  supply  the  place  of  the  latter,  which  will 
probably  be  published  before  long.  This  again  adds  to  the 
honor  of  Wisconsin  in  the  line  of  progress  in  the  education 
of  deaf-mutes. 

PLEDGES  FULFILLED. 

When  the  Wisconsin  phonological  institute  engaged  the 
attention  of  the  Milwaukee  school  board  and  the  state  legis- 
lature in  behalf  of  its  objects  it  voluntarily  pledged  itself  to 
use  its  best  endeavors  to  supply  trained  teachers  by  the  oral 
method,  and  to  be  watchful  of  the  day  schools.  This  obliga- 
tion has  not  been  neglected. 

In  prosecuting  the  work  which  it  has  assumed  it  has 
spared  no  effort,  been  deterred  by  no  obstacle,  faltered  at  no 
discouragement,  but  has  given  freely  of  its  time,  ability  and 
means  for  the  good  of  the  cause  and  the  advancement  of  the 
state  in  this  direction. 

Its  money  expenditures  aggregate  about  |15,000,  con- 
sisting mostly  of  contributions  from  citizens  of  Milwaukee. 

A   DUTY    OP   THE    STATE. 

It  will  not  be  denied  that  the  duty  of  the  state  to  pro- 
vide for  the  training  of  teachers  for  the  oral  instruction  of 
deaf-mutes  is  no  less  binding  and  imperative  than  is  its  duty 
to  provide  for  training  teachers  of  hearing  children. 

For  the  latter  it  has  to  some  extent  provided,  but  not 
adequately.  For  the  former  it  has  made  no  special  provis- 
ion. To  meet  this  obligation,  however,  will  be  easy  and 
inexpensive  for  the  state  in  coimection  with  the  state  normal 
school  at  Milwaukee  and  by  joint  arrangement  with  the 
Milwaukee  school  board,  securing  the  services  of  the  teachers 
in  the  public  day  school  for  the  deaf  and  the  use  of  that 
school  for  practice  work. 

INCREASED    APPROPRIATION. 

The  development  of  the  public  day-school  system  of 
educating  deaf-mutes  by  the  oral  method  demands  that  state 


.24  PUBLIC    DAY    SCHOOLS    FOR    DEAF    MUTES. 

aid  to  such  schools  shall  be  increased  to  $  1 50  per  pupil  for  nine 
months'  instruction,  which  equals  the  cost  of  instruction  and 
support  at  the  Delavan  institution.  When  this  is  done,  not 
only  can  such  schools  be  opened  in  many  more  places,  but 
increased  compensation  will  command  the  services  of  the 
very  best  teachers,  reduce  the  size  of  classes,  insure  the  high- 
est efficiency  and  most  perfect  results  of  speech  teaching  and 
general  education.  A  bill  to  this  effect  is  now  pending  in 
the  legislature. 

CATHOLIC  SCHOOL  FOR  DEAF-MUTES. 

This  sketch  of  progress  in  Wisconsin  in  the  education 
of  deaf-mutes  would  be  incomplete  did  it  omit  to  mention 
the  school  established  and  maintained  for  that  purpose 
by  the  Catholic  church  at  St.  Francis,  a  beautiful  southern 
suburb  of  Milwaukee. 

Among  a  most  interesting  cluster  of  Catholic  educa- 
tional reformatory  and  ecclesiastical  schools  and  institutions 
at  St.  Francis  is  one  for  the  deaf-mutes,  under  the  charge  of 
Rev.  M.  M.  Gerend  assisted  by  Catholic  sisters. 

At  one  time  this  school  was  taught  by  the  oral  method, 
but  was  changed  to  a  sign  school  for  lack  of  time  to  develop 
speech. 

A  feature  of  special  interest  in  this  school  is  the  atten- 
tion given  to  carving,  drawing  and  cabinet  work,  in  which 
the  pupils  excel.  Specimens  of  their  work  in  altar  pieces, 
shown  at  the  Milwaukee  exposition,  were  marked  by  a  high 
order  of  skill.  For  such  work  the  services  of  its  pupils  are 
in  demand  and  command  good  wages. 

It  is  needless  to  add  that  the  school  was  established  and 
is  maintained  in  pursuance  of  the  policy  of  the  Roman 
Catiiolic  church,  based  on  the  opinion  that  the  best  way  to 
make  good  men  and  citizens  and  save  their  souls  is  to  com- 
bine religious  with  secular  education  in  the  same   school. 

It  is,  however,  deplored  that  in  view  of  the  noble  ser- 
vices rendered  to  the  cause  of  oral  instruction  of  deaf-mutes 
by  the  Roman  Catholic  church  and  its  representatives,  that 
in  Wisconsin  it  should  neglect  the  spiritual  advantages  of 
speech  in  the  education  of  its  deaf-mute  children.  It  is,  to 
say  the  least,  extremely  doubtful  if  so  grave  a  consideration 
as  this  should  be  made  secondary  to  skill  in  handicraft, 
however  valuable  that  may  be,  and  doubtless  is,  to  the 
pupil  and  the  community. 


LAW  OF  WISCONSIN. 


The  following  is  the  law  of  Wisconsin  providing  for  the  establishment 
and  support  of  public  day  schools  for  deaf-mutes  with  limited  state  aid  : 

AN  ACT  in  relation  to  the  instruction  of  deaf  mutes  in  incorporated  cities  and 
villages.. 

The  people  of  the  State  oj  Wisconsin,  represented  in  Senate  and  Assembly,  do  enact 

as  follows  : 

Section  i.  Upon  application  by  the  mayor  and  common  council  of  any 
incorporated  city,  or  by  the  president  and  board  of  trustees  of  any  incorporated 
village  in  the  state,  to  the  state  superintendent  of  public  instruction,  he  shall 
by  and  with  the  consent  of  the  state  board  of  supervision,  grant  permission  to 
such  city  or  village  to  establish  and  maintain,  within  its  corporate  limits,  one 
or  more  schools  for  the  instruction  of  deaf  mutes  residents  of  the  State  of  Wis- 
consin. 

Section  2.  The  mayor  of  any  incorporated  city,  and  the  president  of  any 
incorporated  village,  which  shall  maintain  one  or  more  schools  for  the  instruc- 
tion of  deaf  mutes  shall  report  to  the  state  superintendent  of  public  instruction 
and  to  the  state  board  of  supervision,  annually,  and  as  often  as  said  state 
superintendent  or  board  may  direct,  such  facts  concerning  such  school  or 
schools  as  said  state  superintendent  or  board  may  require. 

Section  3.  There  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  state  treasury  in  the  month  of 
July  in  each  year  to  the  treasurer  of  every  incorporated  city  or  village  main- 
taining a  school  or  schools  for  the  instruction  of  deaf  mutes,  under  the  charge  of 
one  or  more  teachers  of  approved  qualifications  to  be  ascertained  by  the  state 
superintendent  of  public  instruction,  the  sum  of  one  hundred  and  twenty-five 
dollars  for  each  deaf  mute  pupil"  instructed  in  any  such  school  at  least  nine 
months  during  the  year  next  preceding  the  first  day  of  July,  and  a  share  of  such 
sum  proportionate  to  the  term  of  instruction  of  any  such  pupil  as  shall  be  so 
instructed  less  than  nine  months  during  such  year. 

Section  4.  The  sums  to  be  paid  as  provided  in  next  preceding  section 
shall  be  audited  by  the  secretary  of  state  upon  the  certificate  of  the  president 
and  secretary  of  the  school  board  and  the  superintendent  of  schools  of  such  city 
maintaining  such  school,  setting  forth  the  number  of  pupils  instructed  in  such 
school  or  schools,  and  the  period  of  time  each  such  pupil  shall  have  been  so  in- 
structed in  such  school  or  schools  next  preceding  the  first  day  of  July;  and,  in 
case  any  such  school  shall  be  maintained  in  an  incorporated  village,  then  upon 
the  certificate  of  the  county  superintendent  of  schools  of  the  proper  county,  ac- 
companied by  the  affidavit  of  the  teacher  or  principal  of  such  school,  setting 
forth  the  same  facts  last  aforesaid;  all  of  which  said  certificates  and  affidavits 
shall  be  first  approved  in  writing  by  the  said  superintendent  of  public  instruc- 
tion, and  the  president  of  the  state  board  of  supervision,  which  certificates  and 
affidavits  so  approved  shall  be  filed  with  the  secretary  of  state,  who  shall  there- 
upon issue  his  warrant  upon  the  state  treasurer  in  favor  of  the  treasurer  of  such 
city  or  village,  as  the  case  may  be,  for  the  sum  which  shall  appear  to  be  due 
pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  act. 

Section  5.  A  biennial  appropriation  is  hereby  made  to  p?y  the  sum 
which  shall  each  year  become   due  and  payable,  under  this  act. 

Section  6.  This  act  shall  take  effect  and  be  in  force  from  and  after  its 
passage  and  publication. 


Home  Training  of  Deaf-Mute  Children. 


By  Paul  Binner. 


The  discovery  that  a  child  Ucks  the  sense  of  hearing  is  a  terrible  shock  to 
the  hearts  of  loving  parents.  The  discovery  and  realization  of  this  calamity 
may  have  been  gradual;  it  may  have  come  suddenly.  I  will  point  out  the 
unmistakable  signs  of  deafness,  for  in  the  early  recognition  lies  the  possibility  of 
imparting  to  the  little  one  the  benefit  oi  early  training,  thereby  fitting  the  child 
from  the  beginning  for  the  future  training  and  education  in  the  school  for  the 
deaf,  which  is  to  prepare  it  for  the  duties  of  life,  and  in  a  measure  compensate 
it  for  the  want  of  the  sense  of  hearing. 

Deaf-mutes  are  divided  into  two  classes:  Congenital  mutes  and  semi-mutes. 
Congenital  mutes  are  those  born  deaf,  and  we  class  with  them  those  who  have 
lost  their  hearing  by  disease  or  other  accident  before  they  learned  to  speak. 
By  the  term  semi-mute,  we  designate  those  who  have  lost  their  hearing  after 
they  had  acquired  the  use  of  speech.  We  shall  speak  of  the  congenital  mute 
first. 

In  families  where  deafness  has  occurred, in  which  it  is  hereditary,  a  recur- 
rence of  the  calamity  is  apprehended  and  a  discovery  of  the  existence  of  deaf- 
ness not  apt  to  be  delayed. 

No  opinion  can  be  formed  regarding  the  hearing  powers  of  a  child  until  it 
is  from  four  to  six  months  old,  for  previous  to  this  time  the  hearing  child  has 
not  become  conscious  of  the  sense  of  hearing;  the  ear  receives  sound  passively, 
unconsciously;  the  brain  is  as  yet  not  able  to  recognize  and  interpret  sound. 
But  after  this  age  the  child  becomes  cognizant  of  hearing,  and  its  general  de- 
velopment enables  it  to  show  the  impressions  which  the  various  kinds  of  sound 
have  made  upon  it.  It  will  turn  in  the  direction  from  whence  the  sound  pro- 
ceeds, and  by  its  facial  changes  show  the  impression  called  forth  by  the  voice 
or  sound.  There  are  exceptional  cases  where  a  hearing  child  does  not  show 
the  power  of  recognition  of  sound  until  it  has  become  a  year  old,  therefore  no 
conclusive  proof  regarding  the  hearing  of  a  child  can  be  established  until  it  has 
reached  the  latter  age. 

Deafness  may  be  caused  by  various  diseases — measles,  scarlet  fever,  spinal 
meningitis,  small-pox,  etc.  When  deafness  is  caused  by  measles  or  scarlet 
fever  it  is  generally  the  result  of  carelessness  or  ignorance.  Parents  cannot 
be  too  careful  in  exercising  the  utmost  caution  during  the  entire  continuance 
of  these  diseases,  and   especially  during   convalescence.      It  is  the   very   last 

26

stages  of  this  disease,  when  the  patient  is  often  looked  upon  as  entirely  re- 
covered, that  the  worst  results  follow.  A  cold,  so  easily  taken  at  this  period, 
causes  a  relapse  from  which  the  child  recovers  with  the  sense  of  hearing  des- 
troyed. A  knowledge  of  the  treacherous  character  of  these  diseases  on  the 
part  of  parents,  a  strict  obedience  to  the  orders  of  the  physician,  might  have 
averted  the  calamity.  My  personal  observation  and  enquiries  in  regard  to  the 
causes  of  deafness  in  Milwaukee  have  convinced  me  that  the  epidemic  appear- 
ance of  scarlet  fever,  during  the  winter  of  1875  to  1876,  is  the  cause  of  deaf- 
ness in  the  majority  of  cases  ranging  at  this  present  date  (1884)  from  eight  to 
fourteen  years  of  age. 

In  children  who  have  lost  their  hearing  after  having  learned  to  speak  a 
little,  or  simply  learned  to  prattle,  the  defect  will  be  easily  recognized,  but 
when  the  child  is  born  so,  or  during  early  infancy  from  some  cause  or  other  be- 
comes deaf,  then  the  discovery  of  the  want  of  this  sense  is  often  difficult.  The 
reason  for  it  is  this:  In  the  deaf-mute  the  sense  of  feeling  not  only  exists,  but 
it  develops  more  fully,  becomes  more  acute,  than  in  the  hearing  child.  Conse- 
quently, all  noise  that  produces  great  vibration,  the  fall  of  any  article  on  the 
floor,  walking  in  the  room,  or  even  out  side  of  the  room  in  a  hall,  the  rumbling 
of  a  wagon  or  railroad  train,  words,  although  spoken  behind  the  child  and  at 
some  distance,  a  call,  communicate  with  the  sense  of  feeling,  causing  the  child 
to  turn  around,  producing  the  illusive  appearance  that  the  noise  or  call  has  been 
heard.  Often,  after  it  has  been  discovered  that  something  is  the  matter  with  the 
child,  the  fact  that  it  does  not  seem  to  hear  a  stamping,  the  falling  of  any  object  upon 
the  floor,  a  loud  song  or  call  from  behind,  induces  the  belief  that  the  child  is 
only  hard  of  hearing,  and  as  the  sense  of  feeling  develops  from  day  to  day  and 
it  apparently  takes  more  notice  of  sounds  and  noises,  the  opinion  is  formed  that 
the  hearing  is  gradually  improving,  and  that  in  due  time  it  will  outgrow  the 
defect.  It  often  takes  years  before  this  illusion  is  dispelled  and  before  the  pa- 
rents realize  the  calamity  which  has  befallen  their  child.  The  aid  of  a  physician 
is  now  sought,  but  in  most  cases  he  has  come  too  late.  At  an  earlier  day  he 
might,  in  some  cases,  have  averted  the  evil.  But  the  tardy  recognition  of  the 
child's  deafness  has  also  caused  a  waste  of  precious  time  and  opportunities  for 
proper  home  training,  the  value  of  which  cannot  be  too  highly  estimated. 

From  the  foregoing  remarks  it  becomes  evident  that  great  care  must  be 
aken  in  making  tests  regarding  the  hearing  of  a  child  suspected  of  being  deaf. 
Reliable  tests  can  only  be  made  when  the  child's  attention  is  drawn  to  persons  or 
objects  in  front  of  it,  while  the  person  making  the  test  must  be  stationed  behind 
it  without  its  knowledge,  and  at  some  distance,  at  least  six  feet.  The  shrill 
sound  of  a  whistle,  a  call  bell,  such  as  is  commonly  used  in  schools  on  the 
teacher's  desk  or  found  upon  the  dining-room  table,  are  excellent  means  of 
establishing  beyond  a  doubt  the  ability  or  inability  to  hear. 

In  order  to  understand  the  term  deafness  fully,  let  me  remark  here  that  ab- 
solute destruction  of  the  hearing  powers  is  found  in  about  one-half  of  the  num- 


28  HOME   TRAINING   OP   DEAF-MUTE   CHILDREN. 

ber  of  deaf-mutes.  But  deafness  is  not  only  the  entire  absence  of  the  sense  of 
hearing,  but  any  deficiency  in  this  sense  which  disables  the  child  from  hearing 
the  ordinary  sound  of  the  voice  as  used  in  speech.  The  degrees  of  hearing 
in  such  cases  are  manifold;  they  are  almost  as  varied  as  the  degree  of  loudness 
and  the  character  of  sounds  vary.  We  cannot  enter  here  into  a  detailed  analy- 
sis. For  our  purposes  it  suffices  to  understand  that  in  a  great  many  cases  the 
ability  to  hear  the  soun4s  of  some,  or  of  all,  the  vovifels  exists  to  a  lesser  or  greater 
degree.  But  this  is  not  sufficient  for  the  child  to  hear  speech;  it  only  hears 
some  of  the  sounds  that  are  produced  in  speech,  and  even  these  are  heard 
indistinctly,  consequently  it  cannot  learn  to  speak.  In  order  to  make  even 
a  little  hearing  useful  it  is  necessary  to  find  out  the  exact  quantity  and  quality, 
so  to  speak,  of  the  hearing  that  is  left.  The  child  should  be  approached  from 
the  rear  and  a  vowel  sound,  for  instance  the  clear  "a,"  as  heard  in  the  word  father, 
pronounced  with  different  degrees  of  loudness.  Then  other  vowels  may  be 
spoken  in  the  same  way,  and  it  should  be  carefully  noted  what  vowels  and  what 
degrees  of  loudness,  penetrate  to  the  ear.  Only  repeated  trials,  at  various  times, 
will  give  a  correct  idea  of  the  quantity,  and  quality  of  hearing  which  is  left. 
With  very  young  children  great  care  must  be  exercised  in  such  tests.  The 
voice  must  not  be  too  loud  at  once,  otherwise  injury  to  the  organs  of  hearing 
may  result,  and  the  speaker  should  not  stand  to  near  the  child,  else  the  motion 
of  the  air,  caused  by  the  voice,  will  be  felt  by  the  child,  and  such  recognition 
of  the  sound  construed  by  the  parents  as  evidence  of  hearing. 

The  inability  to  learn  to  speak  is  often  supposed  to  lie  in  an  entire  absence 
or  in  a  deformity  of  the  organs  of  speech.  But  these  cases  are  so  rare  that  we 
need  not  consider  them  here.  The  reason  why  the  child  does  not  learn  to  speak 
is  the  entire  or  partial  want  of  the  sense  of  hearing.  If  there  should  be  any 
good  grounds  for  the  belief  that  the  vocal  organs  are  defective,  "tongue-tied," 
as  it  is  commonly  termed,  the  advice  of  a  reliable  physician  should  be  sought. 
By  doing  this  without  delay  parents  will  benefit  themselves  and  their  child, 
for  the  physician  can  either  remedy  the  defect  or  establish  for  a  certainty  the 
cause  of  the  abnormal  condition,  which  in  most  cases,  will  be  found  in  the 
organs  of  hearing.  Is  the  child  deaf,  the  sooner  the  parents  know  it  the  better, 
as  we  shall  see  in  the  subsequent  pages. 

The  days  are  past  when  a  deaf  person  was  looked  upon  as  wholly  unfit  for 
mental  development,  in  fact,  as  no  better  than  an  idot.  It  required  centuries 
to  dispel  this  opinion,  the  outgrowth  of  ignorance.  To-day  we  have  schools  for 
the  deaf,  and  the  country  that  does  not  provide  some  means  of  education  for 
such  children,  must  be  sought  among  the  uncivilized.  Education  in  this  branch 
is  progressive,  the  same  as  education  in  general.  In  our  country,  ^\'here  within 
the  last  twenty  years  wholesome  advances  in  educational  matters  have  taken 
place,  the  work  among  deaf-mutes  has  received  a  new  impetus  by  the  introduc- 
tion of  the  oral  or  articulate  method.  This  teaches  the  child  to  speak  and  to 
read  spoken  words  from  the  lips  of  other  persons.     This  method  is  used  inmost 


HOME   TRAINING   OF   DEAF-MUTE   CHILDREN.  29 

of  the  European  schools.  France  alone  has  not  fiilly  cast  aside  the  old  method 
of  teaching  the  sign  or  gesture  language,  and  to  spell  the  words  by  means  ol 
the  finger  alphabet.  We  will  call  this  the  French  school.  The  oral  method 
came  from  Germany  to  England,  and  from  thence  it  has  been  introduced  into 
our  country.  Owing  to  various  obstacles  its  progress  has  been  slow,  but  it  has 
taken  root  and  will  grow.  We  are  a  practical  people,  and,  although  men  will 
sometimes  cling  with  wonderful  tenacity  to  old  institutions  and  prejudices,  the 
practical  character  of  our  nation  will,  in  due  time,  aid  in  the  survival  of  the 
fittest.  In  Europe  this  method  has  displaced  the  antiquated  French  school, 
and  the  time  is  surely  coming  when  the  old  method  will  be  looked  upon  in  our 
country  as  a  thing  of  the  past. 

What  is  the  difference  in  the  two  methods?  Briefly,  this:  Theora/method 
teaches  the  child  to  speak  by  word  of  mouth  and  to  read  spoken  language  from 
the  lips  of  others.  The  deaf-mute  is  no  longer  a  mute.  With  the  other  method 
the  deaf-mute  remains  dumb  forever.  We  liberated  the  slaves  after  a  terrible 
conflict  and  after  long  years  of  waiting  and  working.  The  men  who  organized 
the  first  anti-slavery  society  in  Chatham  Street  chapel,  New  York,  in  the  year 
1833,  were  a  minority;  but  in  less  than  thirty  years  this  minority  had  grown 
into  a  powerful  majority.  The  minority  which  to-day  is  engaged  in  liberating 
the  deaf-mutes  of  our  country  from  the  bondage  of  silence  by  means  of  the  oral 
method,  has  no  less  earnest  and  zealous  advocates.  Among  those  foremost  in 
this  work  is  the  Wisconsin  Phonological  Institute,  an  association  of  gentlemen 
and  ladies  who  devote  their  energy  and  means  to  the  promulgation  and  dis- 
emination  of  the  oral  method,  and  who  have  practically  identified  themselves 
with  the  cause  by  establishing  and  maintaining  the  "  Milwaukee  Day  School 
for  the  Deaf." 

But,  in  connection  with  the  blessing  of  speech  to  the  dumb,  this  method 
carries  another,  that  of  enabling  the  day  schools  for  the  deaf  to  be  organized 
wherever  it  is  practicable,  in  our  towns  and  cities,  for  there  is  no  more  fruitful 
soil  for  the  growth  of  the  oral  method  than  where  the  child  can  be  continually 
with  hearing  people,  and  so  may  have  the  opportunity  to  practice  daily  what  it 
has  learned  in  school.  The  exile  from  home,  from  parents,  brothers  and 
sisters,  from  all  that  is  dear  to  the  child,  its  seclusion  with  a  number  of  other 
unfortunates  within  the  walls  of  an  asylum  or  institution,  where  it  becomes 
estranged  from  the  outer  world,  and  thereby  rendered  unfit  for  the  duties  of 
lite  amidst  a  speaking  and  a  hearing  world;  all  these  are  evils,  created,  aye, 
demanded,  by  the  very  nature  of  the  French  method. 

From  the  previous  dissertation  upon  the  two  methods,  it  clearly  follows 
that  all  subsequent  remarks  upon  home  education  for  the  deaf  are  based  upon 
the  oral  method. 

The  deaf  mute  is  an  intelligent  being,  therejore  he  can  be  educated.  This 
truth  we  must  fully  recognize,  in  order  to  render  the  following  pages  of  prac- 
tical value.

In  cases  where  the  disease  which  caused  deafness  affects  also  other  parts, 
the  child's  whole  constitution  may  be  more  or  less  impaired,  the  effects  of 
which  will  generally  weaken  the  intellectual  powers,  but  rarely  to  such  a  degree 
as  to  debar  the  child  from  mental  development.  Scrofulous  diseases  are  most 
apt  to  cause  such  general  degeneration.  But  where  this  is  not  the  case,  where 
the  child  was  born  deaf,  or  the  nature  of  the  sickness  which  destroyed  the  sense 
of  hearing  such  as  to  confine  its  ravages  only  to  the  ear,  then  the  physical  and 
mental  organization  is  the  same  as  that  of  a  hearing  child,  with  the  exception  ol 
the  want  of  the  hearing  organs  and  the  consequent  inability  to  speak.  How, 
then,  is  the  intellectual  development  to  take  place  ?  How  is  the  deaf-mute  to 
learn  Irom  others  when  he  cannot  understand  their  language  nor  hear  their 
speech?  The  solving  of  this  problem  rests  in  the  special  education  for  deaf' 
mutes.  But  the  results  of  the  deaf-mute  school  are  in  proportion  to  the  support 
given  by  home  training,  preparatory  to  and  continuous  with  the  child's  school  life. 
When  parents  bestow  no  more  care  upon  their  deaf-mute  child  than  to  feed  and 
clothe  it,  and  give  no  thought  to  its  moral  and  intellectual  needs,  the  subse- 
quent training  in  the  school  will  meet  with  serious  difficulties,  and  small  results 
must  be  the  inevitable  consequence  of  such  neglect;  therefore  it  is  of  great 
importance  that  the  deaf-mute,  from  infancy,  be  made  the  subject  of  special 
care.  Owing  to  his  misfortune  the  deaf-mute  is,  throughout  his  whole  life, 
more  dependent  upon  the  patience  and  forbearance  of  others,  than  a  hearing 
person.  His  earliest  education  must  tend  to  lessen  this  dependency.  Parents 
who  really  love  their  deaf-mute  child  will  take  pains  to  eradicate  the  unpleas- 
ant peculiarites  to  which  such  children  are  subject,  and  train  them  to  cultivate 
snch  manners  and  habits  as  will  make  them  agreeable  companions  to  those  with 
whom  they  come  in  contact.  The  deaf-mute  needs  a  great  deal  of  attention, 
close  observation,  careful  guidance,  and  the  better  and  the  earlier  this  is  done, 
the  sooner  will  he  learn  to  be  less  dependent  and  to  be  treated  more  like  a 
hearing  child.  As  his  physical  well-being  is  of  so  much  importance,  he  should 
not  be  effeminated  by  over-heated  rooms,  excess  of  warm  clothing,  or  confine- 
ment to  the  house.  Such  treatment  weakens  his  frame,  weakens  him  mentally 
as  well  as  physically;  he  becomes  a  burden  to  his  family  and  fellow-men,  less 
fit  to  receive  an  education,  disqualified  for  manual  labor,  and  he  is  finally  ren- 
dered discontented  and  unhappy  through  life.  The  diet  of  the  deaf-mute 
should  consist  of  wholesome  food  and  be  given  at  regular  times.  He  must  not 
be  over-fed  or  accustomed  to  dainties.  By  frequent  washing  and  bathing,  out- 
door exercise  and  light  manual  labor,  his  physical  powers  should  be  developed 
and  strengthened,  and  a  spirit  of  activity,  discipline  and  contentment  created. 
We  readily  perceive  the  value  of  a  strong,  healthy  body  in  a  hearing  child;  but 
of  much  more  value  is  it  to  the  deaf-mute  child  to  possess  a  strong  constitu- 
tion, not  easily  influenced  by  the  inclemency  of  the  weather  or  the  many  ail- 
ments which  flesh  is  heir  to,  because  his  knowledge  of  guarding  against  them 
and  his  ability  to  protect  himself  are  so  limited. 


HOME   TRAINING   OF   DEAF-MUTE   CHILDREN.  31 

Unpleasant  habits,  which  necessarily  follow  the  want  of  hearing,  should 
be  prevented  or  overcome,  such  as  a  slouchy,  noisy  gait,  audible  breathing, 
groaning,  excessive  screaming,  handling  chairs  and  other  articles  in  a  boister- 
ous manner,  slamming  the  door,  smacking  the  lips  while  eating,  etc.  The 
deaf-mute  cannot  hear  the  noise  he  makes,  therefore  the  parents  must  draw  his 
attention  to  it  and  make  him  conscious  of  the  unpleasant  nature  of  such  habits. 

In  order  to  accomplish  this,  a  means  of  communication  is  necessary. 
Through  the  ear  the  child  cannot  be  reached;  the  eye  is  the  only  channel 
through  which  communication  is  possible.  In  the  same  manner,  as  we  say 
everything  to  the  hearing  child,  we  must  show  everything  to  the  deaf  child; 
therefore  we  communicate  with  him  by  means  of  signs  and  gestures.  As  soon 
as  the  intellectual  faculties  awaken  in  the  deaf-mute,  the  eye  carries  the  images 
of  things  and  actions  to  the  brain,  where  they  are  shaped  into  ideas;  but  these 
ideas  are  not  produced  as  in  the  hearing  child,  which  associates  words  with  the 
conceptions,  for  the  deaf-mute  thinks  only  in  images  and  pictures.  We  reach 
the  intellect  of  the  hearing  child  while  it  is  yet  unable  to  speak  or  to  under- 
stand language,  by  means  of  signs  and  gestures,  using  the  hands,  arms, 
the  head  and  facial  expressions  for  the  purpose,  and  the  child  uses  the  same 
means  of  expressing  ideas.  It  motions  toward  the  door  when  it  wishes  to  be 
taken  out,  claps  its  little  hands  to  show  delight,  etc.  The  same  means  must 
be  adopted  for  the  deaf  child  and  its  gesture  language  cultivated,  enlarged, 
improved,  for  it  is  the  only  means  of  reaching  and  developing  the  intellect. 
As  the  child  grows  older  and  its  understanding  better,  these  signs  and  gestures 
will  be  improved  upon  by  the  child  and  new  ones  added.  Such  changes  and 
additions  should  be  carefully  noted  by  the  parents,  in  order  to  be  able  to  meet 
the  intellectual  advancement  of  the  child.  The  more  a  deaf  child  is  treated  like  a 
hearing  child  the  more  will  it  grow  intellectually.  Weplay  with  the  hearing  child, 
sing  to  it,  talk  with  it.  Do  the  same  with  deaf  child.  The  fact  that  the  child  can- 
not hear,  should  not  exclude  the  little  one  from  pleasant  and  instructive  pastimes; 
they  are  not  practiced  in  vain,  for  the  deaf  child  can  see,  and  that  is  the  key  to  its 
brain.  The  actions  which  the  child  sees,  the-daily  routine  work  of  parents, 
brothers  and  sisters,  watching  the  latter  at  play,  and  when  old  enough,  par- 
ticipating with  them,  the  use  of  building  blocks,  pictures  drawn  on  a  slate  or 
paper,  be  they  ever  so  crude;  in  short,  all  that  we  would  do  to  interest  a  hear- 
ing child,  tends  to  awaken  the  intellect,  cultivates  the  perceptive  power  and 
trains  the  muscles.  All  these  prepare  the  child  for  the  future  school  educa- 
tion. But  the  most  important  part  of  home  training,  in  connection  with  ges- 
ture and  other  means,  is  the  constant  use  of  spoken  language.  The  infant  will 
not  be  able  to  imitate  the  movements  of  the  lips,  but  as  physical  and  mental 
development  progresses,  the  child  will  become  conscious  of  and  familiar  with 
the  action  of  the  lips  and  tongue,  and  in  time  learn  to  imitate  wliat  it  has  seen 
so  often,  and  gradually  get  an  idea  of  spoken  language.  This  idea  of  spoken 
language,   of  sound  emitted  during  the  movements  of  lips  and  tongue,  can  be 


32  HOME   TRAINING   OF   DEAF-MUTE   CHILDREN. 

best  brought  to  the  consciousness  of  the  child  by  frequently  placing  its  hand 
against  the  tliroat  of  the  speaker,  where  the  vibration  caused  by  speaking  will 
be  plainly  felt;  placing  the  other  hand  on  the  child's  throat  will  be  apt  to  cause 
it  to  imitate  the  action.  In  cases  where  a  deaf  child  uses  the  voice  but  very 
little,  the  opportunity  should  be  made  use  of,  and  when  it  cries,  laughs,  or 
utters  any  kind  of  sound,  its  hand  brought  in  contact  with  the  vibrating  parts, 
and  in  this  manner  a  voluntary  use  of  the  voice  may  be  established.  This,  of 
course,  applies  only  to  children  over  two  years  of  age.  Many  a  hearing  child 
does  not  begin  to  speak  before  that  time.  Words  and  short  sentences  which 
occur  so  often  every  day,  for  instance,  the  names  of  members  of  the  household, 
such  words  as  "papa,"  "mainma,"  "come,"  "go,"  "  go  out,"  "good-by," 
etc.,  may  not  only  be  recognized  but  also  imitated  by  the  child,  and  this  imita- 
tion, be  it  ever  so  imperfect,  is  of  the  greatest  value  when  it  enters  school. 
The  oral  method  has  this  in  advance  of  the  other,  that  a  child  can  be,  yes, 
should  be,  sent  to  school  at  an  earlier  age  than  is  practicable  with  the  old 
inethod.  The  older  a  deaf-mute  is,  the  more  stiff  and  unwieldly  are  his  organs 
of  speech,  and  the  chances  of  making  a  good  speaker  of  the  child  are  necessarily 
lessened.  A  child  admitted  to  school  at  six  or  seven  years  of  age,  which  has 
had  the  advantages  of  early  home  training,  where  consequently  the  organs  ol 
speech  have  not  been  suffered  to  lie  idle,  but  in  a  measure  at  least,  have  been  exer- 
cised and  rendered  pliable  by  the  imitation  of  words  or  sentences,  presents 
less  difficulties  to  a  proper  development  of  the  organs  than  one  that  has  to  take 
its  first  lessons  in  the  use  of  the  organs  of  speech  when  it  enters  the  school. 
Furthermore,  home  training  has  cultivated  the  perceptive  faculties,  and  the 
progress  at  school  in  lip-reading  will  be  greatly  aided.  "When  a  child  has  been 
fortunate  enough  to  learn  to  speak  a  few  words,  the  gestures  or  signs  for  the 
objects  or  ideas  must  be  abandoned,  and  the  child  taught  to  use  the  spoken 
word  only.  We  must  always  bear  in  mind  that  gestures  and  signs  are  merely 
the  means  to  attain  the  use  of  speech  and  language. 

The  moral  training  of  the  deaf-mute  is  another  important  part  of  home 
education.  The  maxim  stated  before,  "Treat  the  deaf-mute  as  you  would  a  hear- 
ing child,"  must  be  also  applied  to  the  moral  development.  True  love,  real 
sympathy,  must  teach  parents  to  instill  into  the  heart  of  their  child  the  love  for 
all  that  is  good  and  noble,  and  to  shun  and  despise  all  that  is  degrading  and 
wicked.  The  inability  of  parents  to  deny  something  to  a  child  so  afflicted,  and 
to  allow  self-will  and  selfishness  to  rule  it,  are  promptings  of  a  sentimental 
sympathy  and  a  false  love,  which,  instead  of  fitting  the  child  for  the  duties  of 
life,  only  tend  to  unfit  it  in  every  way.  For  a  child  A\hich  grows  up  under 
such  influences  must  necessarily  become  an  unpleasant  member  of  society,  a 
burden  to  its  fellow-men,  liable  to  many  reproaches,  rebukes  and  unkind 
words  and  deeds  from  those  with  whom  it  may  come  in  contact.  Teach  the 
child  obedience,  prevent  obstinacy,  awaken  the  conscience.  This  calling  forth 
the  better  nature  of  the  child  is  brought  about  by  abstaining  from  all  passionate

reprovals,  and  by  correcting  the  child's  faults  in  a  gentle,  quiet  manner,  in  a 
spirit  of  kindness.  The  approving  or  disapproving  expression  in  the  counte- 
nance of  father  or  mother  will  soon  teach  the  child  to  discriminate  between 
good  and  evil,  and  to  obey  these  gentle  and  yet  forcible  monitors.  In  cases  of 
disobedience,  where  punishment  appears  to  be  the  only  remedy,  great  caution 
should  be  exercised  by  the  parents,  and  the  question  clearly  solved,  whether 
the  child  really -understands  the  nature  of  the  wrong,  or  the  fact  that  it  has 
disobeyed.  A  deserved  punishment,  recognized  as  such  by  the  child,  will  be 
only  a  power  for  good,  while  on  the  contrary,  it  will  harden  and  embitter  it.  In 
no  case  should  a  hearing  child,  much  less  a  deaf  child,  be  punished  by  seclusion 
in  a  dark  room.  To  place  it  in  the  corner  of  a  room,  with  the  face  toward  the 
wall,  is  a  severe  punishment,  as  it  is  thereby  entirely  excluded  from  all  inter- 
course with  the  outer  world  by  means  of  that  sense  which  does  duty  for  two, 
the  sight.  Let  earnest  love  and  true  sympathy  guide  the  parents  in  the  diffi 
cult  task  of  training  heart  and  mind  of  their  deaf  child. 

We  will  now  consider  briefly  the  condition  of  the  semi-mute,  and  in  what 
manner  we  can  assist  him.  As  stated  before,  a  semi-mute  is  a  person  that  has 
lost  his  hearing  after  he  has  learned  to  speak.  If  the  sense  of  hearing  is  des- 
troyed before  the  child  is  eight  years  of  age,  speech  will  gradually  be  lost;  after 
this  age,  the  more  advanced  in  years,  the  more  perfect  will  the  speech  remain, 
dependent,  of  course,  on  the  intellect,  previous  education  and  social  surround- 
ings. The  loss  of  hearing  in  such  a  case  is  easily  recognized.  The  child  itself 
will  realize  the  changed  condition.  In  order  to  preserve,  to  some  extent,  at 
least,  the  speech  which  the  child  had,  the  parents  should  insist  that  all  its  wants, 
all  its  communications,  be  made  in  spoken  language.  The  child  must  speak  as 
much  as  possible,  and  if  able  to  read,  practice  aloud  daily.  Faults  in  pronun- 
ciation should  be  corrected  at  once.  A  very  common  mistake  is  the  adding  of 
a  syllable  to  the  word;  for  instance,  "meat-a,"  "sheep-a."  To  ocrrect  this, 
place  its  hand  under  your  chin  against  the  throat,  and  have  the  child  do  the 
same  with  the  other  hand,  pronounce  the  word  and  have  the  child  do  the  same. 
The  vibration  felt  in  the  throat  will  readily  correct  the  error.  At  all  times 
have  the  child  carefully  watch  the  lips  of  the  speaking  person.  Although  it 
may  not  be  able  to  read  from  the  lips,  this  practice  will  prepare  the  way  for 
learning  lip-reading  in  the  school  for  the  deaf,  where  such  a  child  will  have  to 
obtain  its.  education,  as  the  school  for  hearing  children  am  not  furnish  the 
necessary  instruction. 

Where  the  hearing  is  acute  enough  to  recognize  vowels,  then  with  a 
proper  attention  on  the  part  of  the  deaf  person  lip-reading  can  be  readily  learned, 
as  most  of  the  consonants  can  be  readily  distinguished  by  the  position  of  lips 
and  tongue.  At  the  same  time,  the  lip-reading  of  vowel  sounds  should  not  be 
neglected.  For  to  converse  with  such  a  person  necessitates  an  unusually  loud, 
voice,  which  renders  communication  very  unpleasant.  If  the  deaf  person  is 
old  enough    o  help  himself  he  can  practice  the  sounds  and  the  powers  of  the

letters  before  a  looking-glass,  placing  himself  with  the  back  toward  the  window 
or  the  light.  When  he  has  become  acquainted  with  these,  and  tested  his 
knowledge  by  reading  them  from  the  lips  of  other  persons,  he  can  practice 
"words  in  the  same  manner.  When  some  proficiency  in  this  has  been  gained, 
poems  or  other  selections  which  have  been  committed  to  memory,  or  which  are 
familiar,  should  be  read  to  him  by  another  person.  Faithful  and  daily  practice 
will  gradually  teich  him  to  recognize  the  different  sounds  in  their  various  com- 
binations and  enable  him  to  read  the  words  of  other  people.  Thus  training 
the  eye  to  aid  the  ear,  the  best  results  may  be  obtained. 

Applicable  to  all  teaching  of  lip-reading  is  this:  Speak  distinctly,  but  do 
not  exaggerate.  The  speaking  person  must  show  his  lips  in  a  favorable  posi- 
tion, as  near  as  possible  on  a  line  with  the  eyes  of  the  deaf  person,  and  he 
should  face  the  light,  so  that  the  organs  of  speech  are  plainly  visible.

THE  DEMAND  for  thoroughly  qualified  articulation  teachers 
of  the  deaf  exceeds  the  supply  and  is  rapidly  increasing.  They 
command  higher  salaries  than  sign  teachers  of  the  deaf,  or  teachers 
of  hearing  children.  Oral  teachers  of  the  deaf,  who  have  a  feel-

advantages.

The  Church  Mission  to  Deaf- 
Mutes, 


NEW  YORK,  N.  Y., 
1872-1893. 


By  Rev.  THOMAS  GALLAUDET,  D.  D., 

General  Manager  of  the  Society. 


THE  CHURCH  MISSION  TO  DEAF-MUTES. 

This  Society  was  incorporated  in  October,  1872,  to  promote 
the  temporal  and  spiritual  welfare  of  adult  deaf-mutes.  It 
was  an  outgrowth  from  St.  Ann's  Free  Church,  founded  in 
October,  1852,  for  deaf-mutes  and  their  hearing  and  speaking 
friends. 

In  efforts  to  lead  deaf-mutes  and  their  families  into  pastoral 
relations  St.  Ann's  Church  has  accomplished  an  important  local 
work  in  the  city  of  New  York,  while  the  Church  Mission  to 
Deaf-Mutes  has  occupied  a  much  larger  field. 


KEV.    THOMAS    GALLAUDET,   D.    D. 


The  General  Manager  of  the  Society,  Eev.  Thomas  Gallau- 
det,  D.  D.,  was  greatly  blessed  in  pioneering  church  work 
among  deaf-mutes  in  several  of  the  larger  cities  of  our  country, 
and  in  opening  the  way  for  Messrs.  Henry  W.  Syle,  Austin  W. 
Mann,  and  Job  Turner  to  be  ordained  as  missionaries  to  then- 
silent  brethren.  At  length,  prcTvidential  circumstances  led  to 
a  division  of  the  extensive  field.  The  Eev.  Mr.  Syle  was  placed 
in  charge  of  this  special  mission  in  the  Diocese  of  Pennsyl-

vania  and  the  adjoining  Dioceses ;  the  Rev.  Mr.  Mann  in  thir- 
teen of  the  Mid-Western  Dioceses  ;  and  the  Rev.  Job  Turner 
in  the  Southern  Dioceses. 

The  missionaries  of  ''  The  Church  Mission  to  Deaf-Mutes," 
New  York,  the  Rev.  Dr.  Gallaudet,  the  Rev.  John  Chamber- 
lain, the  Rev.  Thomas  B.  Berry,  and  the  Rev.  Anson  T.  Colt, 
were  limited  in  their  operations  to  the  five  Dioceses  of  the 
State  of  New  York,  the  six  Dioceses  of  New  England,  and  the 
Diocese  of  Newark  in  New  Jersey. 

The  Rev.  Francis  J.  Clerc,  D.  D.,  has  rendered  important 
aid  to  this  peculiar  department  of  church  work.  For  several 
years  he  held  services  for  deaf-mutes  in  St.  Stephen's  Church, 
Philadelphia,  and  now  as  rector  of  St.  Paul's  Church,  Phillips- 
burg,  Central  Pennsylvania,  he  does  all  in  his  power  to  en-

courage  those  who  are  striving  to  preach  the  Gospel  to  the 
deaf  by  the  sign-language. 

The  Rev.  Henry  W.  Syle  was  taken  to  Paradise  on  Epiph- 
any, the  6th  of  January,  1890,  and  the  Rev.  J.  W.  Koehler 
became  his  successor.  The  Rev.  S.  S.  Searing,  missionary  to 
the  deaf-mutes  in  Boston  and  vicinity,  and  the  Rev.  C.  O. 
Dantzer  in  the  Diocese  of  "Western  New  York  and  Central  New 
York,  are  associates  of  "  The  Church  Mission  to  Deaf- Mutes,'* 
New  York.  The  Rev.  J.  H.  Cloud,  in  charge  of  St.  Thomas's 
Mission,  St.  Louis,  is  an  assistant  to  Rev.  Mr.  Mann.  Thus 
it  will  be  seen  that  there  are  eleven  clergymen  of  the  Protes- 
tant Episcopal  Church  in  the  United  States  who  can  minister 
to  deaf-mutes  in  the  sign-language. 

The  Church  Mission  to  Deaf-Mutes,  New  York,  has  estab- 
lished the  Gallaudet  Home  for  Aged  and  Infirm  Deaf-Mutes,  on 


The  Church  Mission  to  Deaf-Mutes.  5 

a  farm  of  156  acres,  by  the  Hudson  river,  six  miles  below 
Poughkeepsie.  The  members  of  this  afflicted  family  are  kindly 
eared  for  and  enjoy  the  great  privilege  of  religious  services  in 
chapel  every  Sunday. 

In  consequence  of  the  labors  thus  briefly  sketched,  large 
numbers  of  the  deaf-mutes  and  their  families  have  been  brought 
to  Baptism,  Confirmation,  and  the  Holy  Communion.  The 
truths  of  the  Bible  and  the  system  laid  down  in  the  Book  of 
Common  Prayer  have  been  exjDlained  to  them,  and  they  have 
been  encouraged  to  live  as  followers  of  our  Lord  and  Saviour, 
Jesus  Christ. 

The  school  training  of  deaf-mutes  lays  the  foundation  for 
church  work  among  them,  as  they  leave  the  fostering  care  of 
their  teachers  and  take  their  places  in  the  battle  of  life.  Much 
has  been  accomplished  to  enable  them  to  bear  their  great 
deprivation  cheerfully  and  bravely,  and  to  cultivate  the  hope 
of  finally  reaching  the  glorious  abodes  in  which  they  will  be 
freed  from  all  human  imperfections.
