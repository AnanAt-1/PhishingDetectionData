<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">1. What is 3D printing?</span></span></p>
<p>3D printing is also known as desktop fabrication or additive manufacturing. It is a prototyping process whereby a real object is created from a 3D design. The digital 3D-model is saved in STL format and then sent to a 3D printer.Â The 3D printer then prints the design layer by layer and forms a real object. <a href="./3d-printing.html" target="_blank">Read more..</a></p>
<p><br /></p><a name="technologies" id="technologies"></a>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. 3D printing technologies</span></span></p>
<p>There are several different 3D printing technologies. The main differences are how layers are built to create parts.Â </p>
<p>SLS (selective laser sintering), FDM (fused deposition modeling) &amp; SLA (stereolithograhpy) are the most widely used technologies for 3D printing.Â Selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) use melted or softened materials to produce layers.Â </p>
<p>This video describes howÂ laser-sintering processes melt fine powders, bit by bit, into 3D shapes.</p>

<p>Generally, the main considerations are speed, cost of the printed prototype, cost of the 3D printer, choice and cost of materials and color capabilities.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">3. The history of 3D printing</span></span></p>
<p>October 5, 2011 - Roland DG Corporation introduced the new iModela iM-01.</p>
<p>Sep, 2011 - Vienna University of Technology, a smaller, lighter and cheaper printing device has now been developed.</p>
<p>This smallest 3D printer weighs 1.5 kilograms, it costs around 1200 Euros.</p>
<p>Aug, 2011 - The world's first 3D printed aircraft created by Engineers at the University of Southampton.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">4. 3D printing applications</span></span></p>
<p>One of the most important applications of 3D printing is in the medical industry. With 3D printing, surgeons can produce patient-specific 3D printed models of patients' body parts or organs. They can use these models to plan and practice surgeries, potentially saving lives.</p>
<p>3D printing makes it possible to make a part from scratch in just hours. It allows designers and developers to go from flat screen to exact, physical part.</p>
<p>Nowadays almost everything from aerospace components to toys are being built with the help of 3D printers. 3D printing is also used for jewelry and art, architecture, fashion design, art, architecture and interior design.</p>

<p>Here are some extraordinary examples of 3D printing:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">5. What is a 3D printer?</span></span></p>
<p>A 3D printer is unlike your standard, 2D inkjet printer. On a 3D printer the object is printed in three dimensions. A 3D model is built up layer by layer. Therefore the whole process is called rapid prototyping, or 3D printing. <a href="./3d-printer.html" target="_blank">Read more..</a></p>
<p>The resolution of the current printers is around 328 x 328 x 606 DPI (xyz) at 656 x 656 x 800 DPI (xyz) in ultra-HD resolution. The accuracy is 0.025 mm - 0.05 mm per inch. The model size is up to 737 mm x 1257 mm x 1504 mm.<br /></p>
<p>The biggest drawback for the individual home user is still the highÂ <a href="./3d-printer/3d-printer-price.html" target="_blank">cost of 3D printer</a>. Another drawback is that it takes hours or even days to print a 3D model (depending on the complexity and resolution of the model). Besides above, the professional 3D software and 3D model design is also in a high cost range.Â </p>
<p>Alternatively there are already simplified 3D printers for hobbyist which are much cheaper. And the materials it uses is also less expensive. TheseÂ <a href="./3d-printer/who-make-3d-printers.html" target="_blank">3D printers for home use</a>Â are not as accurate asÂ <a href="./3d-printer/who-make-3d-printers.html" target="_blank">commercial 3D printer</a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">6.Â Whats the difference between a basic rapid prototyping machine and a 3D printer?</span></span></p>
<p>3D printers are the simple version of rapid prototyping machines. It is lower lost and less capable.Â </p>
<p>Rapid prototyping is a conventional method that has been used by automotive and aircraft industries for years.</p>
<p>In general 3D printers are compact and smaller than RP machines. They are ideal for use in offices. They use less energy and take less space. They are designed for low volume reproduction of real objects made of nylon or other plastics.Â That also means 3D printers make smaller parts. Rapid prototyping machines have build chambers at least 10 inches on a side, a 3D printer has less than 8 inches on a side. However aÂ 3D printer is capable of all the functions of rapid prototyping machine such as verifying and validating design, creating prototype, remote sharing of information etc.<br />
<br />
Consequently 3D printers are easy to handle and cheap to maintain. You can buy one of those DIY kit in the market and build up yourself. It is cheaper than the professional rapid prototyping, for $1000 or less you can have one 3D printer. While the professional rapid prototyping cost at least $50,000.<br />
<br />
3D printers are less accurate than rapid prototyping machines. Because of its simplicity the material choices are also limited.<br /></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.Â What can you make with a 3D printer?</span></span></p>
<p>In 3D printing area, people say "If You Can Draw It, You Can Make It".Â In the video below shows many items can be made with a 3D printer. However complicated objects can only be made by professional 3D printers, they are not yet affortable for common family.Â </p>

    <p>You can learn how to 3D model by learning how to use 3D modeling tools such as Rhino, Blender or SketchUp. It will take you some weeks to be familiar with 3D modeling tools such as SketchUp,Â Rhino and Blender. To become a professional user will take you at least half a year to study and practice.</p>

Greetings from Workbench Projects!

We are a very young makerspace in Bangalore, hosting and conducting a lot of workshops and events for all age groups to introduce the DIY culture and promote it
.
We have recently collaborated with Intel Education and are conducting some 3D printing demoâs in the K12 segment.

We are interested in hiring a couple of 3D printers (4 to 5 printers) for our events. This will be a regular exercise.

We are encouraged to write to you as we found your company on several forums talking about giving 3D printers on rent.

We are based out of bangalore and are looking to get these 3D printers in the month of October. If you do not give 3D printers on rent, but know someone who might, we would appreciate if you can lead us to them. If you do rent them out, please provide a quote for 5 printers to be rented for 2 days.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
