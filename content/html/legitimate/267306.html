  <div id="center"><h1>cron4j</h1>
<p><strong>cron4j</strong> is a <strong>scheduler</strong> for the <strong>Java  platform</strong> which is very similar to the <strong>UNIX cron</strong> daemon. With cron4j you can launch, from within your Java applications, any task you need at the right time, according to some simple rules. </p>
<p>The Java 2 platform already has a built-in scheduler, implemented with the class <em>java.util.Timer</em>. The cron4j scheduler, however, acts in a different way. You can say to the <em>java.util.Timer</em> scheduler something like &quot;launch this task after 5 minutes from now&quot; or &quot;launch it after 5 minutes from now, then repeat it every 10 minutes&quot;. That's all. The cron4j scheduler, instead, lets you do something a little more complex, like &quot;launch this task every Monday, at 12:00&quot;, &quot;launch it every 5 minutes, but don't launch it during the weekend&quot;, &quot;launch it every hour between the 8:00AM and the 8:00PM and launch it every 5 minutes between the 8:00PM and the 8:00AM&quot;, &quot;launch it once every day but Sunday, during every month but July and August&quot; and so on, and all that with a single line of code.</p>
<p>Programming  the cron4j scheduler is  easy, you have to know just a few methods.  The launching rules for every task must be expressed with a string called <strong>scheduling pattern</strong>, whose <strong>syntax is equal to</strong> the one used by <strong>the UNIX crontab</strong> entries. If you know how to manipulate the UNIX crontab, the most is done. If you can't, don't worry: crontab scheduling patterns rules are very simple and you can learn them in minutes. By the way, you will find them explained in the cron4j documentation.</p>
