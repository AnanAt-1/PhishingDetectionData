<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I abbandoned this project few months ago since I found the very good <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/sysutils/apcupsd/">apcupsd port</a> in FreeBSD ports tree, which works great with my APC RS 1000 ups. </p>

<h1>apcusbd</h1>
<p>A few months ago I purchased an <a href="http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23" target="_blank">APC 
  RS 1000</a> UPS device.<br />
  It comes with a USB cable to attach it to your PC, and with an APC software 
  bundle to check UPS status.<br />
  Bundled software is for MS Windows only, and since I had to attach a FreeBSD 
  server to this UPS, it was totally useless for me.<br />
  So I started searching FreeBSD ports tree to find a daemon that could listen 
  to UPS messages, and simply start commands on critical events, such as starting 
  a backup of important files on power failures, and shutting down the server 
  when battery level is too low.<br />
  I tried a few things but none of them worked with this UPS model, or they were 
  just too complex to install or use (I think that installing a 10 Megabytes package 
  just to start a command when the power fails is wast of space/time/resurces!).<br />
  Finally I found a C source that does some of the simple things I needed, but 
  it was an unfinished prototype, so I decided to develop my own daemon: <strong>apcusbd</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>Note: <a href="http://www.0x01.org/blog/?p=32" target="_blank">click here for 
  an italian description of apcusbd - clicca qui per una descrizione in italiano 
  di apcusbd</a>.</p>
<p><strong>apcusbd</strong> is a daemon, written in Perl, that lets your <a href="http://www.freebsd.org" target="_blank">FreeBSD</a> 
  box, listen in on an APC UPS attached via a USB cable, and react to the following 
  three events, launching commands you specify in configuration:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> OnBattery: utility power failure, UPS started using battery power<br />
    OnUtility: utility power restored, UPS stopped using batteries<br />
    OnShutdown: UPS on battery and battery charge level is low (under a specified 
    threshold)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three main files for <strong>apcusbd</strong> (see INSTALL document 
  in distribution package to know how to install these files on your system):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> apcusbd: this is the main Perl script. It requires Perl 5 or better. You 
    should copy it in /usr/local/sbin .<br />
    apcusbd.sh: this is the daemon control script, used to start/stop/restart 
    the daemon. You should copy it in /usr/local/etc/rc.d .<br />
    apcusbd.conf: this contains daemon configuration. Usually you will copy it 
    in /usr/local/etc (or in /etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have installed these files, you will need to configure <strong>apcusbd</strong>. 
  Please see INSTALL document for a detailed installation procedure and hints 
  about configuration.<br />
  The most difficult part of the configuration process is finding the device file 
  that your system used for the APC monitor usb unit.<br />
  Explore dmesg results to find it. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Example: </p>
  <p>on my FreeBSD box, dmesg reports following device:</p>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">%dmesg | grep -i ups<br />
    uhid0: American Power Conversion Back-UPS RS 1000 FW:7.g8 .I USB FW:g8, rev 
    1.10/1.06, addr 2, iclass 3/0</font><br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that /dev/uhid0 is the UPS device on my system, and that I had to 
  put the following line in apcusbd.conf file:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">upsdev &quot;/dev/uhid0&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also you can specify a commqnd to run for each the three events <strong>apcusbd</strong> 
  can track. Example: to send root user a message on power failure, you can add 
  the following to apcusbd.conf file:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">onbatterycmd &quot;echo power failure 
    | mail -E -s apcusbd root&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can keep track of UPS related events with syslog. Default <strong>apcusbd</strong> 
  syslog facility is local6 but you can change it in apcusbd.conf.</p>
<p>You can also add a safe-shutdown command to run when UPS is on battery and 
  battery charge level runs under a defined threshold. Example: following lines 
  let <strong>apcusbd</strong> start a system shutdown when battery level goes 
  under 5%:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">shutdownthreshold 5<br>
    shutdowncmd "shutdown -h now"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>apcusbd had been tested on a FreeBSD 5.3 with a APC RS 1000 (firmware 7.g8) 
  UPS unit. It will likely work on different configuration but I had not personally 
  tried it. If you tried a different configuration, please write it to me, so 
  that I can add your comments here.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Riccardo &quot;vic&quot; Torrini tested <strong>apcusbd</strong> v0.01 on 
    FreeBSD 4.11 and a APC RS 500 unit. He found problems with &quot;use bytes&quot; 
    Perl directive, but he succeded in making <strong>apcusbd</strong> work manually 
    adding includes files in his Perl installation. After his feedback I changed 
    the code so that it should now work with FreeBSD 4.xx too, without any hassle.</li>
