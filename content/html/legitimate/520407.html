 <h3>Laurel Anne Hill</h3>
 <p>Laurel Anne Hill is the author of <i>Heroes Arise</i>
(KOMENAR Publishing), which she describes as "her debut parable," in
October 2007. <i>ForeWord Magazine</i> selected <i>Heroes Arise</i>
for its Book of the Year Award (bronze award, 2007, science fiction
category). <i>Heroes Arise</i> also was chosen as a finalist for the
Next Generation Indie Book Awards.</p>
 <p>She grew up in San Francisco, with more dreams of adventure
than good sense or money. "I read <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>, <i>Dune</i>
and <i>"Stranger in a Strange Land</i> long before I read <i>War and
Peace</i> or Of Time and the River. Yet I first had read <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i>, <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> and many other
classics, and not as school assignments," she recalled. "The local
library was my refuge. In childhood, I used imaginary friends to cope
and survive. In my teens, novels carried me to the imaginary places I
craved. Now, my imaginary friends have returned to serve as characters
in my stories."</p>
 <p>Hill's shorter fiction and creative nonfiction have been
published in the <i>Contra Costa Times</i>, <i>Nth Zine</i>, <i>Lynx
Eye</i>, the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i>, <i>Space and Time</i>, and
a variety of small-circulation magazines. In 2005, she was awarded
first prize in the Ninth Annual Captivating Beginnings Short Story
Contest. She received an honorable mention in the 2004 Soul-Making
Literary Competition, an extended community arts outreach program of
the National League of American Pen Women, Nob Hill, San Francisco Bay
Area Branch.</p>
 <p>Hill earned B.A and M.S. degrees in Biology. Her various
occupations in the health care industry have involved medical
technology, nuclear medicine technology, pharmaceutical technical
services, drug regulatory affairs, environmental health &amp; safety
and diesel. She adds, "Please don't ask me to understand Stephen
Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i>. There is a good reason why I
chose biology and environmental health &amp; safety as a career instead
of physics."</p>
 <p>Her close brushes with death, love of family, respect for
honor and belief in a higher power continue to influence her writing
and life.</p>

 <h3>Lisa Spangenberg</h3>
 <p>Lisa Spangenberg grew up in rural New Hampshire, and kept
moving West in search of more to read, eventually earning a Ph.D. in
English from UCLA, before relocating to Seattle. Her academic area of
specialization is medieval English and Celtic languages and
literatures, particularly texts about otherworld folk and their
interactions with mortals.</p>
 <p>She's been a reader of SF and Fantasy for most of her life,
and, not surprisingly, ended up studying medieval fantasy at
university. Her academic area of specialization is medieval English and
Celtic languages and literatures, particularly texts about otherworld
folk and their interactions with mortals. She added, "If I had to pick
a favorite author I'd say Anonymous, followed by C. J. Cherryh."</p>
 <p>She is the first digital medievalist on the Web, working for
e-book and multimedia pioneer Voyager, Callipe Media, and helping
university faculty incorporate digital technology in their teaching and
research. Said Spangenberg, "People are sometimes puzzled by the idea
of a medievalist working so very closely with digital technology, but
the combination of digital technology and medieval studies isn't as
unusual as you might think. We medievalists are surprisingly
technologically savvy; there's a lot you can do with a scanner, some
manuscripts and a computer."</p>
 <p>Her latest publication is her dissertation: <i>The Games
Fairies Play: Otherworld Intruders in Medieval English and Celtic
Literary Narratives</i>. She also contributed several articles to <i>The
J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment</i>.
She serves as a sys admin at Written in Stone, a forum for readers who
like to write (<a href="http://www.macallisterstone.com/forums">http://www.macallisterstone.com/forums</a>).</p>
 <p>Her website including reviews, Celtic studies and her blog is

 <h3>Lucienne Diver</h3>
 <p>Lucienne Diver is a fifteen-year veteran of the publishing
business. She began as an agent at the prestigious Spectrum Literary
Agency and has recently moved to The Knight Agency (<a
 href="http://www.knightagency.net">www.knightagency.net</a>).</p>
 <p>Her interest in books came naturally. She said, "I'm a
voracious reader and grew up reading anything from Conan Doyle to Mary
Stewart to Isaac Asimov." As an agent, she represents over forty
authors of science fiction, fantasy, mystery/suspense and romance and
is a member of AAR, SFWA, RWA and MWA. "In general I'm more of a
fantasy gal than sf, with a lot of exceptions, " she explained. "I also
handle paranormal romance, where the boundaries with urban fantasy have
been blurring."</p>
 <p>Lucienne Diver is also a published author under her pseudonym
Kit Daniels. 2009 marks her debut under her own name with the YA novel <i>Vamped</i>
from Flux.</p>

 <h3>Michelle Sagara West</h3>
 <p>Michelle Sagara West was born, raised and has mostly lived in
Toronto, Ontario. She's worked since 1986 in one capacity or another at
Bakka, a SF/F specialty store, now Bakka-Phoenix, through two different
owners. She and her "very, very understanding husband (a necessary
quality in the spouse of a writer)," have two sons, ages ten and
fifteen.</p>
 <p>Sagara West, a 1992 Campbell Award nominee, started her first
novel, <i>Into the Dark Lands</i>, in 1986, which was eventually
published by Del Rey books at the tail end of 1991. <i>Children of the
Blood</i>, <i>Lady of Mercy</i> and <i>Chains of Darkness</i>, <i>Chains
of Light</i> followed, closing her first series at four books. Those
books were subsequently reprinted by BenBella books, as Michelle Sagara
West.</p>
 <p>She wrote four books for Luna as Michelle Sagara: <i>Cast in
Shadow</i>, <i>Cast in Courtlight</i>, <i>Cast in Secret</i> and the
forthcoming <i>Cast in Fury</i> and nine books for DAW as Michelle
West. Her first book in The House War series, <i>The Hidden City</i>,
also her first hardcover, was published this year.</p>
 <p>Michelle Sagara has just finished her first YA novel. She's
still casting about for a perfect title.</p>
 <p>"I have far too many books, and a constant lack of shelf
space; no matter what I do, books sneak into the house and slowly
spread out on every available surface. I love, and have always loved,
reading--I think that's probably the single biggest motivator in my
decision to try to write novels." Besides reading, Sagara West works
part-time, parents and writes novels. She says, "The state of my house
reflects this."</p>
 <p>Her other interests, when time allows are: anime, manga, WOW,
Firefly, Buffy, bookselling and typesetting. She also writes F/SF book
reviews. She identifies herself as a feminist.<br />

 <h3>Peri Charlifu</h3>
 <p>Peri Charlifu is a master potter and extremely talented
craftsman and artist. Years ago, I was a member of a family of potters
who owned Marshall Pottery, a seventy-year old business distributing
their products worldwide. I've seen the accumulated skills of potters
who have perfected their craft over forty years or more, and in Peri, I
recognized the same level of mastery.</p>
 <p>Peri knows his market. I've been a contributing artist at SF
conventions for over thirty years, and I recognize someone who not only
knows what fantasy fans like, but is able to tailor to the craft show
market as well. My personal favorite is his work based upon the
writings of H. P. Lovecraft. I've purchased over twenty pieces for my
home and always look to see if he's done something new along these
lines.</p>
 <p>Peri routinely shows more than a hundred pieces at SF
conventions. It's easy to see that not only is he talented, but is also
fast and reliable. I've seen art show demonstrations in which Peri has
constructed huge and beautiful creations in less than an hour. To me,
there is no better mark of professionalism than an artist who can
create something in front of a room full of spectators.</p>
 <p class="right">--Bio by David
Martin</p>
 <p>Two quotes from Peri: <br />
</p>
 <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>"Don't tell me you're an
artist, show me you're an artist."</i><br />
 <i>"Perfection is the culmination of many pieces, not a single
ideal."</i><br />
