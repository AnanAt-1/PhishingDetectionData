<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Geneva">"When my time comes--that's the way I
   wanna go," Keith said as he snapped his fingers. "Earth to heaven
   in an instant!"</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith's words went right by me at the time.
   There would be a day, though, when they would come back. For the
   moment, I busily tucked the blanket around Josiah as we headed out
   the front door for Richard's memorial service.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One day, a short time later, Keith walked
   into our bedroom looking more serious than usual--and that was
   saying a lot. He was holding the book, <I>Rees Howells:
   Intercessor</I>, in his hand as he flopped on the bed.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Did you know Rees Howells and his wife
   gave their infant son away so they could go to Africa as
   missionaries?"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"They gave him away..." I repeated, flatly.
   Already I didn't like the sound of this.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"They gave him to relatives," Keith
   continued, "and God told them they 'could never claim him again'.
   Years later, after he graduated from college, he joined his father
   in the ministry in Africa. But he was already all grown
   up."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"That's really heavy." Wasn't there
   something else we could be talking about?</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Yeah. God told him to do it."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I sure hope it was God," I said, and now I
   bit my lip, wondering what Keith was leading up to.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Mel, what if God told us to give Josiah
   away?"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I can't see how that could ever be the
   Lord's will," I shot back at once. "I mean, do you really think he
   would ask us to do that?"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I don't know. He might. God can do
   anything he wants."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Well, I always want to obey the Lord, no
   matter what it costs. But that would be a hard one. Are you saying
   you would be willing?" I pressed him.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"It would be the hardest thing I've ever
   done," he said, seriously. "But if I was one hundred percent
   positive it was God, I'd do it."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By now, my heart was so heavy it could have
   burst. I was afraid Keith was going to do something crazy. What if
   he tells me he thinks God wants us to give Josiah to somebody
   else? I was thinking, What would I do? You don't just give kids
   away, do you? My emotions were rocking.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Things had been so much easier when it was
   "just us and our stereo". We'd always said we would give the Lord
   everything. But it seemed a lot easier to give God things like
   money, comfort, and time. How do you give your child? Rees Howells
   found out. So did Abraham, with his son Isaac. The enormity of
   their commitment was staggering to me.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fortunately, it wasn't a question we needed
   an immediate answer to. We weren't going to put Josiah up for
   adoption or anything. Still, our parent-hearts were being
   painfully tested. And for the next few months Keith, in
   particular, was going through a deeper testing than I knew about
   until much later.</FONT></P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>JANUARY 15. 1979</B></FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Lord, Help Again!</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">My Jesus, please pour your strong life out
   on me...I'm almost dead I need and desire to be close to you
   ....Please, God, you know I'm serious about this. Send your angel
   to answer.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One evening, in February 1979, Keith was
   poking through his bookshelf--pulling books out, scanning a few
   pages, then putting them back. I noticed that he kept at it, until
   one book seemed to capture his interest. Keith carried it over to
   his favorite chair--a $5 Naugahyde recliner we "scored" at the
   resale store--and kicked back to read for a while. I smiled and
   shook my head. Keith was always tackling books that frightened me
   off just by their size.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It seemed like he was only half a chapter
   into it when he called me over.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Mel, do you remember this
   book?"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It didn't look familiar. "No. What's it
   about?" "It's all about revivals! Real ones!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I did remember what he was talking about
   now. The book was called Revival Lectures and it was written by a
   nineteenth-century revivalist named Charles Finney. One night
   about a year ago, Keith had phoned me from the road, sobbing into
   the phone. He had read me a whole chapter of that book over the
   phone! Keith had been reading more Finney lately and, tonight, he
   had rediscovered this particular book.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He went back to his reading now--no long
   passages to read out loud, I guessed--and I got ready for
   bed.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When I walked out into the living room to
   say goodnight, Keith was still engrossed in reading. But by this
   time, his expression had changed from excitement to total
   sobriety. Keith was so absorbed that he barely looked up as he
   mumbled a goodnight to me. I went in our room and turned out the
   light.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The next thing I knew Keith was shaking me
   awake. I was so groggy I could hardly understand what he was
   saying.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Mel, wake up. you need to get
   up."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Uh ... why?"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"It's happened! Get up. We're gonna have a
   special meeting right away."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Our voices woke Josiah up and he started to
   cry for my attention. It was barely daylight and through the haze
   of grogginess I wondered what on earth Keith was going on
   about.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I've got to go to the other houses," he was
   saying. "I'll be back."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As I turned my attention to Josiah, the
   front door slammed and Keith took off in the gray morning light.
   One of the first places he went was one of the men's dorms. Wayne
   Dillard and a few other guys were awakened the same way I'd been.
   Later on Wayne told me what happened when Keith shook him
   awake.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"As soon as I got my eyes half-way opened,
   I could see his face--it was like he was smiling from the inside
   out. He was radiant."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Wayne, wake up!" Keith said. "We've got to
   have a meeting." "Okay," Wayne mumbled, "but what time is
   it?"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"It's about six. Listen, I was out in 'The
   Ark' praying all</FONT> <FONT FACE="Geneva">night. And<B> I just
   got saved.</B>" "You what?"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>"I just got saved!"</B></FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">BY THE TIME ALL SEVEN HOUSES HEARD ABOUT
   THE SPECIAL meeting, our community was buzzing with curiosity.
   Having an early morning meeting was in itself a shock. Usually, no
   one even saw Keith before 10 a.m. because of his late-night
   schedule. I watched everyone quietly drift into The School
   House--throwing questioning glances at each other. It looked like
   all seventy of us were there--crammed into the living room, and
   spilling over into the hall and kitchen, anxiously waiting to find
   out what was going on.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As soon as I saw Keith's face I knew
   something big was going on. His eyes were clear and bright and his
   whole face was lit with a broad grin. Something had happened to
   him!</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"You know I've been struggling with a lot
   of questions about my ministry and the Lord's will for my life,"
   he began, "I've been really wanting God to be more real. Well, I
   was up all night in 'The Ark' and God showed me so much sin in my
   life that I spent the whole night weeping and crying out to Him. I
   told the Lord I wasn't going to leave 'The Ark' until I had a
   breakthrough--no matter how long it took. Finally, it happened. I
   had a touch from the Lord like I've never had in my whole life.
   And I know I just got saved--I just got saved last night." Keith's
   words stunned everyone as much as they stunned me. I could see it
   in their faces. Just got saved? I thought, What have you been if
   you haven't been saved? But Keith just kept talking, either
   ignoring or not noticing the wide-eyed surprise on everyone's
   face. "Last night I was reading Finney, and I just couldn't get
   past a chapter called 'Breaking Up The Fallow Ground'. God
   convicted me of so much fallow ground in my life--ground that's
   hard and crusty and needs to be broken up for Him."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now the happiness in Keith's eyes clouded
   over as they started to fill with tears. Blinking them back, Keith
   pulled some sheets of paper out of his Bible and unfolded them as
   he kept talking.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I've already gotten these things right
   with God, now I want to confess them to you and ask for your
   forgiveness because my sins have affected you. First of all, I
   know I haven't been a very good leader. I've wounded some of you
   with my words and my crummy attitudes .... "</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now Keith broke and really started to cry,
   but he controlled himself enough to go on.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"The Lord has also shown me areas of pride
   and unbelief in my life. I don't read my Bible enough and I don't
   pray enough, either. And I'm so undisciplined. I've been a bad
   example to all of you. I have no excuse except for being lazy and
   loving myself more than I really love God .... "</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">He went on for several minutes, pouring his
   heart out and crying.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Another area God has convicted me in is
   not trusting him for finances. When we offered the cassette of my
   'Jesus Northwest' concert in the newsletter, we said we'd send it
   for free, or for a donation. The Lord showed me we shouldn't have
   even mentioned donations after promising not to solicit funds--so
   we're going to send everybody's money back to them right
   away.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I know my sin has broken God's heart. I
   know it's hurt you, too--and I'm really, really sorry. I'm not
   worthy to bear the holy name of Christian. Please forgive
   me."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then Keith picked up his Bible and read a
   scripture to us from Hosea: "Break up your fallow ground, for it
   is time to seek the Lord until He comes to rain righteousness on
   you .... "Keith continued, "Fallow ground is ground that was once
   tilled, but has since gotten hard and unusable. Before it can
   receive seed it needs to be broken up and made soft again. Finney
   says to break up the fallow ground of our heart we need to examine
   our motives, actions, and state of mind very
   carefully."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then picking up the Finney book, Keith read
   to us. "Many people never seem to think about doing this. They pay
   no attention to their own hearts, and never know whether they are
   doing well in their walk with the Lord or not--whether they are
   bearing fruit or are totally barren."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith explained the two kinds of sin Finney
   talks about. Sins of commission are the things we do that we
   shouldn't. Included on Finney's list were--lying, cheating,
   gossip, wasting time, slandering others, love of possessions,
   vanity, envy, bitterness, hypocrisy, having a bad temper, and
   hindering the usefulness of others. Keith added in a few areas
   that Finney didn't list because they weren't as prevalent in his
   day--things like sexual sin, drugs, and involvement with false
   religions.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">And if that wasn't enough, there were the
   sins of omission~ the things we don't do that we should. Included
   in these were lack of love for God, for the Bible, for prayer, for
   the poor and needy, and for the lost all around us and in foreign
   lands. Also listed were the sins of ingratitude, neglecting to be
   careful about our words and actions, and a neglect of
   self-denial.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Then--Finney again. "There are many
   professing Christians who are willing to do almost anything in
   religion that does not require self-denial. They are so far from
   realizing that self-denial is a condition of discipleship, that
   they do not even know what it is!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">As Keith was talking an awesome sense had
   been coming over me. Instead of thinking that the things he'd done
   were so terrible, I found myself starting to examine my own heart,
   thinking, if God put the searchlight on Keith, what does all this
   mean for me? By now I was starting to make a mental list. A long
   one.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith went on to read the whole chapter out
   loud to us. It was a real "outline" for a point-by-point
   examination of our own hearts. Finney said that "general"
   confessions of sin are not good enough. Since our sins were
   committed one by one, as much as possible they need to be repented
   of one by one--confessing to God those sins committed against him,
   and confessing to other men the sins committed against them. No
   shortcuts allowed! Then Keith paused and seemed to take a deep
   breath before he continued.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I believe God wants to do something
   powerful in all of our lives. What God did for me, he wants to do
   for you. He wants all of us to have pure hearts that are soft and
   open to him. We all need to humble ourselves and break up the
   'fallow ground' of our hearts so God can be glorified. I believe
   we all need to have a breakthrough with God. I really think we all
   need to pray</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Everybody bowed their heads and closed
   their eyes. Then Keith started praying a very powerful prayer and
   a hush fell over the room. In just a moment something began to
   happen.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Suddenly one of the women burst into tears.
   She'd been sitting on the floor and now she was on her face, her
   whole body heaving with deep uncontrollable sobs. A few others
   started to weep, and the next thing we knew we were all on our
   faces, crying, and calling out to God. Actually, some of us could
   do little more than moan. The feelings were so deep it was hard to
   even put them into words. It was a gut-wrenching time of
   conviction and soul-searching. The sound of wailing started to
   rise and fill the room--and it went on and on.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After a long time, Keith asked everyone to
   go and take some time alone with God. "Go home and make out a
   list. List every area of sin that the Lord is showing you and will
   continue to show you. List it in detail. Let the Lord shine his
   spotlight into your hearts."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">We met again later that evening and over
   the next few days-- day and night. We had hours of prayer,
   weeping, and humble open confession. Everyone was being broken.
   They'd read their list of sins and ask forgiveness of God and
   those who'd been affected. There was such an awesome sense of
   God's presence in the room, sometimes overwhelming. And more often
   than not after someone shared, tears of sorrow ignited into tears
   of joy-- and even laughter as many broke through to God at deeper
   levels than ever before. They said they felt cleansed and
   refreshed in a brand new way--like their souls had just come alive
   and the weight of the world was lifted off their shoulders. It
   seemed like,</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">one by one, this was happening to
   everybody. Everybody, that is, except me.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After a few days, so many people had
   experienced their "breakthrough" I started to worry about when I'd
   get mine. Keith was beginning to worry about me, too. He'd walk
   over to me while I was lying on the floor praying and say, "Do you
   think you might be getting close?" He was so excited and had
   waited so long for this to happen, he wanted to be sure it
   happened for me, too.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of the first people Keith phoned was
   Winkie. "It's happened!" he told him. "We're having a powerful
   move of God!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Meanwhile, word was getting out locally,
   and some people from the Vineyard showed up at our ongoing
   meetings. Even some neighbors came. All with the same
   results--deep conviction of sin and a fresh touch from the
   Lord.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One night a brother from another ministry
   came and taught us about God's sacrificial love. At the end of his
   teaching he shared a story with us.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It seemed there was a man with the job of
   raising and lowering a drawbridge so passenger trains could cross
   a deep canyon. This man had one child, a son, that he loved very
   much. One day the little boy wandered toward the bridge without
   his father noticing.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Soon the father heard a train whistle. As
   he started to pull the lever to lower the bridge, he looked out
   the window, and saw that his son had crawled down into the big
   heavy gears. If he pulled the lever his son would be
   crushed!</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There were only seconds to decide. Hundreds
   of people would die if he didn't lower the bridge--all sons and
   daughters loved by someone. He took a deep breath and his heart
   screaming with pain, he pulled the lever.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The bereaved father stood helplessly at the
   window, beating on it with both fists and screaming out in
   anguish, as the train zipped quickly over the bridge. The
   passengers saw him and thought he was waving--so they waved
   happily back without realizing the price that father had just paid
   for them.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">When the story was over, every face looked
   stricken. As the meeting was dismissed I started crying. Running
   out into the dark night, I fell on my knees in the backyard with
   my face pressed into the grass. I still hadn't had a
   "breakthrough" like all the others, but with this story, I'd felt
   the heart-crushing pain of the father. In my mind's eye, I could
   only see my curly-haired Josiah in those gears.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Oh Lord," I cried, "please give me a clear
   picture of what it cost you to send your only Son to earth. I'm so
   sorry for taking your sacrifice for granted--and for not loving
   you the way you deserve to be loved. Please forgive
   me!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The next day, I left the meeting and went
   to sit in a car parked near The School House. I decided I wouldn't
   leave until I got my breakthrough. That worked for Keith, so maybe
   it would work for me. I didn't know what else to do.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I'd already made a long list of my sins and
   shared them with the ministry, repenting to God and man. I
   confessed to everyone that sometimes I got really tired of living
   in community. Also, that I was still striving for recognition in
   my songwriting and how much pride I had when Keith would say in
   concert, "Melody and I wrote this song together." My prayer life
   and my time in the Word left so much to be desired, too. I also
   confessed that I took the best baby clothes for Josiah before
   sending some donated clothing off to Mexico. I knew I'd hurt
   people by not speaking the truth in love and by being judgmental.
   To be honest, I was even judging this revival. Actually, I was mad
   at Finney, and jealous of those who were starting to look happy
   while I was feeling totally miserable. I felt like such a
   mess.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Maybe I'm not repenting in the right way, I
   thought. As I sat in that car, I was devastated by the blackness
   of my heart. I thought I loved God. Maybe I didn't love him at
   all--maybe I never did. But the thing that scared me the most was
   the fear that I might be incapable of loving God. So why should he
   love me--or forgive me, for that matter? I started to question
   every motive of my heart and felt like I was tumbling down a dark
   shaft of despair.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After a while Keith came out to talk to me.
   As much as he wanted to see me have a breakthrough, he didn't
   think camping out in a parked car was the answer. "Mel, why don't
   you come back into the house now."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I can't. I don't even know if I love God.
   How can I go to a prayer meeting?"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Mel, you love God. I know you do. Maybe
   it's not gonna happen the same way for you. Come on back
   in."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">I went back into the house, but I wasn't
   comforted. I saw the wickedness of my heart and I felt torn from
   the inside out. I didn't understand why I seemed to get "passed
   over" by the Lord.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">There finally came a point, later, where I
   just had to let it go and go on--without the happy feelings and
   with the thought that maybe I wasn't a Christian. Perhaps God
   doesn't deal with everybody in the same way, I reasoned. But then,
   maybe I only felt like I'd been left behind in the darkness. I
   decided I would serve God in that darkness as fully as everyone
   else was serving him in the light--whether or not, I was really
   saved.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After several days, when the intensity of
   it all subsided, it seemed that the Lord had drawn near to our
   community in an incredible way. Later on, we would refer to this
   time as "The Revival". Charles Finney defined revival as "a new
   beginning of obedience to God". and that was definitely what
   happened. It was a life-changing time for all of us, myself
   included--even though my memories were a bit painful.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith also knew that his statements about
   "just getting saved" came from his black and white way of looking
   at things. It was just that he'd glimpsed a walk with God that
   required such a deeper commitment, it was almost as if he'd never
   given his heart to the Lord before. He said, "It's like getting
   born again . . . again!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith believed the Lord wanted the spirit
   of revival we'd just experienced to sweep the nation. It just
   happened that the very next concert Keith had scheduled was at the
   end of March in Tulsa at Oral Roberts University--in the 11,500
   seat Mabee Center. Tulsa seemed like the perfect place to start,
   with its clusters of well-known ministries. And ORU was the
   best-known Christian university in America. When revival broke out
   there it would resound across the nation! Keith marveled at God's
   perfect planning.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It seemed that with "The Revival", Keith
   had also found his answer to our long-standing questions about
   finances.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">One afternoon he bounced into the kitchen
   and said lightly, "Mel, we're just gonna go wherever God sends us
   and not worry about money."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Well, usually you just go for offerings
   anyway." I wasn't sure why Keith was making this sound like it was
   so different from what we were already doing.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Yeah, but we're not going to worry about
   how much of an offering or honorarium we get," he replied, "or
   even if we get one at all. In fact, I really feel like God is
   telling me we need to pay our own way into these cities--and not
   ask for anything from the churches!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Now that did sound different.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith's new financial decision and his
   desire to see our revival spread had an immediate effect on his
   scheduled time at ORU. Since they didn't usually take offerings at
   the Mabee Center, they were going to bless Keith with $2,000 for
   one concert. But now the plans needed to change a bit. Keith
   didn't want the $2,000- -and he wanted to go and minister for at
   least a week.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In Keith's thinking, when Finney went into
   a city it wasn't for a "one-night stand." He stayed until the Lord
   finished doing what he wanted to do. If revival broke out, Finney
   could be in the same town for months. With what had just happened
   to Keith and our community, it sure seemed like God was up to
   something big.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">The first person Keith phoned in Tulsa was
   the ORU student body president who'd invited him in. Keith got the
   guy on the phone and explained to him what he felt God's new
   direction was--that we were to come for a week for free. The guy's
   jaw must have dropped.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">A short time later, we received a return
   phone call from this brother, saying we had a green light. Instead
   of going to the Mabee Center, Keith could preach for a week--in
   the chapel! We were all so excited we could hardly see straight.
   So we made plans to go to Tulsa and had no idea when we'd be
   back.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith said, "If revival breaks out, we
   might even end up moving to Tulsa!" He wrote a prayer bulletin and
   sent it out to the 22,000 people who were now receiving our Last
   Days Newsletter. Keith asked them to pray because we were going to
   Tulsa and he believed God wanted to pour out his Spirit and bring
   repentance--and put a spirit of prayer and conviction upon the
   city.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith was also really excited about God
   picking ORU in particular as the place to begin. Like all
   ministries do, they'd been experiencing some financial
   difficulties. Keith really hoped that if the Lord birthed this
   spiritual re-awakening in this, the "cradle" of so many other
   ministries, it would open the door for fresh blessings to pour in.
   Keith said, "God is really going to bless ORU once this revival
   breaks out there!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith sent Wayne Dillard and a few other
   guys to Tulsa two weeks ahead of the chapel meetings to meet with
   the local pastors so they could get ready and start praying. Keith
   had also planned a pastors' luncheon when he got to town so he
   could meet them and share his heart about the city-wide
   revival.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">After Wayne had been in Tulsa for about a
   week though, Keith received an upsetting call from him. "Keith,
   they don't want you to come."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Wayne explained that the student group that
   invited Keith had neglected one critical detail--they forgot to go
   through the proper channels with the change of plans. And the
   administration was surprised when they first found out about the
   upcoming revival on campus by reading about it in the school
   newspaper.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"I got a call frown the ORU administration
   today and they said they didn't invite you in so you shouldn't
   come," Wayne told him.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith figured their concerns were
   understandable. After all, they didn't really know him or his
   ministry very well. From their point of view "uninviting" him
   probably seemed like the responsible thing to do.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Maybe the administration had heard about
   Keith's steamy message a year before at Oklahoma Baptist
   University. There was a tremendous response from the students--but
   it did cause some real shock waves when Keith told
   them:</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"Going to church, or going to a Christian
   college, or going to cemetery--I mean seminary--doesn't make you a
   Christian any more than going to McDonalds makes you a hamburger!
   If there were that many on-fire people in all of Oklahoma, there'd
   be headlines all over the nation: 'Oklahoma Has
   Revival'!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">For whatever reasons, Keith's time in Tulsa
   was cancelled. Keith wasn't convinced however that the decision
   reflected the Lord's heart. He was going to pursue getting it
   reversed</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith set up twenty-four-hour prayer chains
   at Last Days and everyone started fasting. Then the next day he
   was on the phone from 8:45 a.m. until dinner time, back and forth
   to Tulsa trying to work things out. But he was told, "We're sorry
   brother. We don't really know who you are. We're responsible to
   protect the students here. We can't let you come."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith finally told them he understood their
   position--but that he felt the Lord wanted him to come anyway.
   That day, he wrote:</FONT></P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>MARCH 10, 1979</B></FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">ORU is cancelled. We're going anyway. In my
   spirit I know it's right, but the rest of me is scared!</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Had the best prayer/cry in a month. Oh! did
   I cry!</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith did have some misgivings. He wondered
   if he'd really heard from God about going. He didn't want to be
   propelled by any false desire of his own to "bring a fiery
   message" to Tulsa. In the end, Keith received what he believed to
   be confirmation from the Lord. The Vineyard was going to send us
   out with their blessings, and there was a scripture passage that
   came to us, Jeremiah 23, that convinced Keith he should go "with
   the right motives". Keith struggled up to the very last minute
   ....</FONT></P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><B>MARCH 11. 1979</B></FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In an hour and fifteen minutes, the
   Vineyard will lay hands on us to go to Tulsa and I'm not sure
   totally we're supposed to go! Oh, my pride, reputation and false
   faith all say "go". My mind and heart are divided. I can't find my
   spirit! ... I must go for the right motives. God said,
   "GO!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P>&nbsp;</P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">We loaded up "The Ark" with about
   twenty-five of our Last Days family and drove all the way to
   Tulsa. When we arrived we had no place to stay, but the student
   body president told us about a house for rent. It only had a few
   pieces of furniture and most of us slept on the floor, but it met
   our needs. We immediately started two things: A twenty-four-hour
   prayer chain and a series of meetings with the ORU administration,
   who were shocked that Keith actually came after being told not
   to.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">At Keith's first meeting with the
   administration he told them about the mighty move of God we'd just
   experienced and how he believed God wanted it to spread across the
   nation--right from their chapel!</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith was emphatic about what he felt God
   had told him. He even asked if he could rent the Mabee
   Center--though at $2,000 a night, that would mean taking out a
   loan. Though ORU had rented the arena in the past to secular
   artists like Billy Joel and Liza Minnelli. they'd continue to pray
   about it over the weekend before they gave Keith a final
   decision.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">That night when Keith got back to our
   little rented house, he announced, "It's not over yet! But we need
   a miracle."</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Twenty-four-hour prayer chains went on all
   through the weekend, and by now we were getting pretty good at it!
   Keith also called a fast. We wanted to do everything in our power
   to see God move.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the meantime, some of the local pastors
   were very open to Keith. In fact when Keith sang and shared his
   vision for the city at a pastors' luncheon it turned into a prayer
   meeting, with many tears and heart-rending prayers. Keith had also
   scheduled meetings in some other churches and schools. He was
   determined to reach the city one way or another.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">On Sunday morning, Keith preached at a
   local Baptist church in West Tulsa. The service usually ended like
   clockwork at noon, but because of the powerful move of God it
   didn't dismiss until 2:30 p.m.--and Keith was invited back for
   another service.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">That night, Keith was given the evening
   service at Tulsa Christian Fellowship--the oldest charismatic
   fellowship in the city. His message and his songs centered on
   God's broken heart over the hypocrisy of lukewarm Christianity.
   Keith often said, "Christians don't like to talk about hypocrisy
   any more than turkeys like to talk about Thanksgiving!" This night
   he was driving the point home, and his preaching was even a bit
   abrasive. He'd come with a burden to shake the congregation into a
   confrontation with themselves and with God, and I knew he was
   about to pull out all the stops.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">"You don't like it, do you?" he said. "You
   came to hear a concert, and you're getting cornered. The Christian
   walk is a bunch of squirming flesh getting nailed down to a cross.
   'Hey man, I want a padded cross. You know, a Posture-Pedic Cross
   with nice springs in it. Something comfortable.' The gospel is a
   no compromise, absolute sell-out for Jesus, one hundred percent
   walk!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Keith had been pacing the floor as he
   spoke, his piano long forgotten. "I hate to say this to you
   folks--I really love you but .... " I could feel it coming.
   Turning to the congregation, Keith pointed and said in a booming
   voice, "You brood of vipers and snakes! . . . Who call yourselves
   Christians and half-heartedly serve Him!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Instant shock ran through the place. Some
   people in the congregation had obviously been going to church
   before Keith was born--let alone born-again. Even I couldn't
   believe my ears.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">But suddenly, it didn't seem to matter. An
   overwhelming sense swept through the room. Keith had gone back to
   the piano and, as he began a song, he prayed, "Lord, these people
   can't know how much I love them. They've heard me yelling and
   screaming at them, but Lord, you know the heart you've put in me
   that hates sin and hypocrisy and compromising so much. You know
   how much I love these people and want to see them turn into
   blazing, glowing Christians. Oh God!--please bring a
   revival!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">Without hesitation, people started rushing
   forward to the altar rail, weeping and sobbing as they came and
   fell on their faces. The pastor joined Keith and they both led the
   congregation in a very powerful time of personal and corporate
   repentance. Keith recalled something the pastor had said in an
   earlier prayer and spoke it out like a battle cry--"Lord, let
   there be a revival and let it begin in me!"</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT FACE="Geneva">It seemed like revival was, indeed, going
   to break out in Tulsa!</FONT></P>
