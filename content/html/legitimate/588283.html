The City of Iloilo is its largest settlement with a total population of 447,992 inhabitants. It is a triangular island, located in the western part of the Visayas. It is about 160 km (99 mi) across. It is divided into four provinces: Aklan, Antique, Capiz and Iloilo, all in the Western Visayas Region. Just closely off the mid-southeastern coast lies the island-province of Guimaras. It is located southeast of the island of Mindoro and northwest of Negros across the Guimaras Strait. To the north and northeast is the Sibuyan Sea, Jintotolo Channel and the island-provinces of Romblon and Masbate; to the west and southwest is the Sulu Sea and the Palawan archipelago and to the south is Panay Gulf. <b><i>Panay</i></b> is the only main island in the Visayas whose provinces don't bear the name of their island</td>

Hodge, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty during the bombing and loss of the U.S.S. PANAY (PR-5), when that vessel was attacked by Japanese airplanes during patrol in the Yangtze River, China, on 12 December 1937. Fireman First Class Hodge displayed great coolness under fire while helping the Captain of the S.S. Mei Ping to get underway and alongside a dock during the attack. Though wounded in this action, he assisted in extinguishing a fire caused by the first bombing, thereby temporarily saving the ship. Salvaging a first aid kit, he then rendered first aid to many wounded Americans and Chinese. The conduct of Fireman First Class Hodge throughout this action reflects great credit upon himself, and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service</td>

<center><b>Last Survivor Recalls 1937 Attack Off China</b><p>By Ted Morris - Sierra Vista Herald via AP<br>Posted:  Sunday Jan 6, 2008 10:32:51 EST<p></center></center></center>SIERRA VISTA, Arizona - Four years before Pearl Harbor was attacked, a local man sailed on a Navy ship that was bombed and sunk by Imperial Japanese warplanes.  The incident happened on Dec. 13, 1937, as the <I><B>USS Panay</B></I> was evacuating U.S. embassy personnel from Nanking, China’s capital of that era. It was a city under siege whose downfall became the infamous Rape of Nanking.<p>The <I><B>Panay</B></I> was a gunboat that belonged to the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, whose 1930s peacetime mission included protection of American lives and property from pirates along the lawless Yangtze River, under a treaty with the Chinese.<p>One of those old Navy "river rats," 94-four-year-old Fon B. Huffman of Sierra Vista, remembers when veterans of the Yangtze Patrol could fill 20 reunion buses.<p>"Now I’m the only one left," Huffman said wistfully. He lives with his daughter and son-in-law, Nancy and Steve Ferguson.<p>Huffman joined the Navy at age 16, a farm boy from Truro, Iowa. By the time of the <I><B>Panay</B></I> incident, Huffman was a 24-year-old veteran sailor.<p>He was a water tender second class in 1937. His job was to man the boiler room, to "burn the oil and make steam."<p>Huffman remembers awakening to the attack, which began at 1:38 p.m.<p>"I was sound asleep," he said. "Bombs blasted us."<p>The <B><I>Panay</I></B> was a 191-foot-long craft with a crew of four officers and 49 enlisted men, plus a native crew of about a dozen.<p>The <B><I>Panay</I></B> was the second generation of a gunboat named for an island in the Philippines. She was armed with eight .30-caliber Lewis machine guns, four on the port side and four on the starboard.<p>The ship picked up a number of evacuees from Nanking and headed down river for Shanghai. Japanese troops had just broken into Nanking, and even though the United States was a neutral country at this time, Nanking was a dangerous place to be.<p>The evacuees aboard the <b><i>Panay</i></b> included a number of American and Italian journalists. Thus, the incident was well covered by the media of that day. One of the U.S. newsmen, Norman Alley of Universal, captured valuable newsreel of the airplanes attacking the ship and her gunners firing back.<p>Neutral British naval vessels also were involved in the incident, including their assisting the rescue of the stranded Yanks and their passengers.<p>Three men aboard the <b><i>Panay</i></b> died, and 27 were injured. From the shore, the crew watched their ship sink.<p>In newsreel and still photos, Huffman is seen throwing an improvised flotation device overboard. He had given up his own lifejacket to Alley. Huffman had received a 1-inch shrapnel wound in his right shoulder from a bursting bomb. He did not immediately report his injury and would not receive his Purple Heart Medal until 1993.<p>On the bridge, the ship’s commanders were exposed to the attack. The captain, Lt. Cmdr. James J. Hughes, was severely wounded. He gave an order to the second-in-command, executive officer Lt. Arthur "Tex" Anders to abandon ship. Anders, the father of Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders, had been wounded in his throat, was unable to speak, and he wrote the order on a wall with a bloody finger, Huffman said.<p>Fortunately, Alley’s 5,300 feet of newsreel made it back to America, but before it was released in theaters, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered 30 feet of film to be cut where it showed Japanese bombers at nearly deck level, according to Perry. This helped America to remain neutral in the early years of the Pacific war by supporting the official apology of Japan, who claimed that its pilots had made a "mistaken identity" of the nationality of the <b><i>Panay</i></b>, even though it displayed several large and conspicuous American flags that the pilots should have seen.<p>On April 22, 1938, the Japanese cut a check for $2,214,007.36 in reparation to the United States for "settlement in full" for the supposedly accidental American casualties that included the sinking of<br>the <b><i>Panay</i></b>.<p>Out of this settlement, Huffman received $1,200. He spent $800 of it on a brand new Chevrolet coupe.<p>Besides the <b><i>Panay</i></b>, he had served aboard the Navy ships <B><I>Lexington [CV 16], Augusta [CA 31], Texas [BB 35], Stack [DD 406], Hawkins [DD 873]</I></B> and <B><I>Lloyd Thomas [DD 764]</I></B>.<p>To this day, Huffman maintains a serious attitude about the <b><i>Panay</i></b> Incident. He strongly feels it was deliberate.<p>"They knew who we were."
