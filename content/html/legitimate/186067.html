Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm</h1>
<p>In recitation we talked a bit about graphs: how to represent them and how to
traverse them. Today we will discuss one of the most important graph algorithms:
<b>Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm</b>, a greedy algorithm that efficiently finds shortest
paths in a graph. (Pronunciation: &quot;Dijkstra&quot; is Dutch and starts out like &quot;dike&quot;).</p>
<p>Many more problems than you might at first think can be cast as shortest path
problems, making this algorithm a powerful and general tool. For example,
Dijkstra's algorithm is a good way to implement a service like MapQuest that
finds the shortest way to drive between two points on the map. It can also be
used to solve problems like network routing, where the goal is to find the
shortest path for data packets to take through a switching network. It is also
used in more general search algorithms for a variety of problems ranging from
automated circuit layout to speech recognition.</p>
<p>Let's start by defining a data abstraction for <b>weighted, directed graphs </b>so
we can express algorithms independently of the implementation of graphs
themselves. In a weighted graph, each of its edges has a nonnegative weight that we can
think of as the distance one must travel when going along that edge.</p>

<p>There are some constraints on the running time of certain operations in this

outgoing edges in constant time per edge. Some graph
implementations do not have these properties, but we can easily write an almost

 going from <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>1</sub></span> to <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>2</sub></span>,
an edge <span class="equation"><i>e</i><sub>2</sub></span>  going from <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>2</sub></span>
to <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>3</sub></span>, and so on. That is, all
the edges must be traversed in the forward direction. The <b>length</b>
of a path is the sum of the weights along these edges <span class="equation"><i>e</i><sub>1</span></sub>,...,
<span class="equation"><i>e</i><sub><i>n</i>-1</sub></span>. We call this
property &quot;length&quot; even though for some graphs it may represent some other
quantity: for example, money or time.</p>
<p>To implement MapQuest, we need to solve the following shortest-path problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given two vertices <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span> and <span class="equation"><i>v'</i></span>, what is the shortest path through the graph that
goes from <span class="equation"><i> v</i></span> to <span class="equation"><i>v'
</i></span>? That is, the path for which summing up the weights along all
the edges from <span class="equation"><i> v</i></span> to <span class="equation"><i> v'</i></span> results in the smallest sum possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that we can solve this problem efficiently by solving a more
general problem, the <b>single-source shortest-path problem</b>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a vertex <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span>, what is the length of the shortest path from <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span> 
to every vertex <span class="equation"><i>v'
</i></span> in the graph?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this problem that we will investigate in this lecture.</p>
<p>The single-source shortest path problem can also be formulated on an <b>undirected</b>
graph; however, it is most easily solved by converting the undirected graph into
a directed graph with twice as many edges, and then running the algorithm for
directed graphs. There are other shortest-path problems of interest, such as the <b>all-pairs
shortest-path</b> problem: find the lengths of shortest paths between all
possible source&ndash;destination pairs. The <b>Floyd-Warshall algorithm</b> is
a good way to solve this problem efficiently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Single-Source Shortest Path on Unweighted Graphs</h2>
<p>Let's consider a simpler problem: solving the single-source shortest path
problem for an unweighted directed graph. In this case we are trying to find the
smallest number of edges that must be traversed in order to get to every vertex
in the graph. This is the same problem as solving the weighted version where all
the weights happen to be 1.</p>
<p> Do we know an algorithm for determining this? Yes: breadth-first search. The
running time of that algorithm is <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>V</i>+<i>E</i>)</span>
where <span class="equation"><i>V</i></span>
 is the number of vertices and <span class="equation"><i>E</i></span>
 is the number of edges, because it
pushes each reachable vertex onto the queue and considers each outgoing edge
from it once. There can't be any faster algorithm
for solving this problem, because in general the algorithm must at least look at
the entire graph, which has size <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>V</i>+<i>E</i>)</span>.</p>
<p>We saw in recitation that we could express both breadth-first and depth-first
search with the same simple algorithm that varied just in the order in which
vertices are removed from the queue. We just need an efficient implementation of
sets to keep track of the vertices we have visited already. A hash table fits
the bill perfectly with its <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(1)</span>
 amortized run time for all operations. Here is
an imperative graph search algorithm that takes a source vertex <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span>
 and
performs graph search outward from it:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom:0px"><span class="comment">(* Simple graph traversal (BFS or DFS) *)</span>

<span class="keyword">end</span></pre>
<p>This code implicitly divides the set of vertices into three sets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <b> completed vertices</b>: visited vertices that have already been removed
    from the queue.</li>
  <li>The <b>frontier</b>: visited vertices on the queue</li>
  <li>The <b>unvisited</b> vertices: everything else</li></ol>
<p>Except for the initial vertex <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span>, the vertices in set 2 are always neighbors
of vertices in set 1. Thus, the queued vertices form a frontier in the graph,
separating sets 1 and 3. The <code>expand</code> function moves a frontier
vertex into the completed set and then expands the frontier to include any
previously unseen neighbors of the new frontier vertex.</p>
The kind of search we get from this algorithm is determined by the <code>pop</code>
function, which selects a vertex from a queue. If <code> q</code> is a FIFO queue, we
do a breadth-first search of the graph. If <code> q</code> is a
    LIFO queue, we do a depth-first search.
<p>&nbsp;If the graph is unweighted, we can use a FIFO queue and keep track of the number of edges
    taken to get to a particular node. We augment the visited set to keep track
    of the number of edges traversed from <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span>; it becomes a hash table
implementing a map from vertices to edge counts (ints). The only modification
needed is in <code>expand</code>, which adds to the frontier a newly found vertex at a
distance one greater than that of its neighbor already in the frontier.</p>

<h2>Single-Source Shortest Path on Weighted Graphs</h2>
<p> Now we can generalize to the problem of computing the shortest path
between two vertices in a weighted graph. We can solve this problem by making minor
modifications to the BFS algorithm for shortest paths in unweighted graphs. As
in that algorithm, we keep a visited map that maps vertices to their distances
from the source vertex <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span>. We change
<code> expand</code> so that Instead of adding 1 to the
distance, its adds the weight of the edge traversed. Here is a first cut at an
algorithm:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom:0px"><span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> q: queue = new_queue()
  <span class="keyword">val</span> visited: vertexMap = create_vertexMap()

    <span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="keyword">val</span> neighbors: vertex list = Graph.outgoing(v)
        <span class="keyword">val</span> dist: int = valOf(get(visited, v))
        <span class="keyword">fun</span> handle_edge(v': vertex, weight: int) =
          <span class="keyword">case</span> get(visited, v') <span class="keyword">of</span>
            SOME(d') =&gt;
              <span class="keyword">if</span> dist+weight &lt; d'
              <span class="keyword">then</span> add(visited, v', dist+weight)
              <span class="keyword">else</span> ()
          | NONE =&gt; ( add(visited, v', dist+weight);
                      push(q, v') )
    <span class="keyword">in</span>
      app handle_edge neighbors
    <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">in</span>

  expand(v0);
  <span class="keyword">while</span> (not (empty_queue(q)) <span class="keyword">do</span> expand(pop(q))
<span class="keyword">end</span></pre>
<p>This is nearly Dijkstra's algorithm, but it doesn't work. To see why,
consider the following graph, where the source vertex is <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span>
= A.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="badgraph.gif" width="184" height="84"></p>
<p>The first pass of the algorithm will add vertices B and D to the map <code>visited</code>,
with distances 1 and 5 respectively. D will then become part of the completed
set with distance 5. Yet there is a path from A to D with the shorter length 3.
We need two fixes to the algorithm just presented:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <code> SOME</code> case a check is needed to see whether the path just discovered
    to the vertex <code> v'</code> is an improvement on the previously discovered path (which
    had length <code>d</code>)<br>
  </li>

  <li>The queue q should not be a FIFO queue. Instead, it should be a <i>priority
    queue</i> where the priorities of the vertices in the queue are their
    distances recorded in visited. That is, <code>pop(q)</code> should be a
    priority queue <code> extract_min</code> operation that removes the vertex with the
    smallest distance.<br>
    <br>
    The priority queue must also support a new operation <code>
    increase_priority(q,v)</code> that increases the priority of an element <code>v</code>
    already in
    the queue <code>q</code>. This new operation is easily implemented for heaps
    using the same bubbling-up algorithm used when performing heap insertions.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these two modifications, we have Dijkstra's algorithm:</p>

<span class="keyword">end</span></pre>
<p>There are two natural questions to ask at this point: Does it work? How fast is it?</p>
<h3>Correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm</h3>
<p>Each time that <code>expand</code> is called, a vertex is moved from the
frontier set to the completed set. Dijkstra's algorithm is an example of a <b>
greedy algorithm</b>, because it just chooses the closest frontier vertex at every
step. A locally optimal, &quot;greedy&quot; step turns out to produce the global
optimal solution. We can see that this
algorithm finds the shortest-path distances in the graph example above, because
it will successively move B and C into the completed set, before D, and thus D's
recorded distance has been correctly set to 3 before it is selected by the
priority queue.</p>
<p>The algorithm works because it maintains the following two invariants:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every completed vertex, the recorded distance (in visited) is the shortest-path
distance to that vertex from <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span>.</p>
<p>For every frontier vertex <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span>, the recorded distance is the shortest-path
distance to that vertex from <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span>, considering just the paths that traverse only
completed vertices and the vertex <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span> itself. We will call these paths <b>internal
paths</b><i>.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that these invariants hold when the main loop starts, because the
only completed vertex is <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span> itself, which has recorded distance 0. The only
frontier vertices are the neighbors of <span class="equation"><i>v</i><sub>0</sub></span>, so clearly the second part of the
invariant also holds. If the first invariant holds when the algorithm
terminates, the algorithm works correctly, because all vertices are completed.
We just need to show that each iteration of the main loop preserves the
invariants.</p>
<p>Each step of the main loop takes the closest frontier vertex <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span>
and promotes
it to the completed set. For the first invariant to be maintained, it must be
the case that the recorded distance for the closest frontier vertex is also the
shortest-path distance to that vertex. The second invariant tells us that the
only way it could fail to be the shortest-path distance is if there is another,
shorter, non-internal path to <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span>. Any non-internal path must go through some
other frontier vertex <span class="equation"><i> v''</i></span> to get to <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span>. But this path must be longer than the
shortest internal path, because the priority queue ensures that <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span>
is the closest
frontier vertex. Therefore the vertex <span class="equation"><i> v''</i></span> is already at least as far away
than <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span>, and the rest of the path can only increase the length further (note that
the assumption of nonnegative edge weights is crucial!).</p>
<p>We also need to show that the second invariant is maintained by the loop.
This invariant is maintained by the calls to <code>incr_priority</code> and <code>push</code>
in <code>handle_edge</code>. Promoting v to the completed set may create new internal
paths to the neighbors of v, which become frontier vertices if they are
not already; these calls ensure that the recorded distances to these neighbors
take into account the new internal paths.</p>
<p>We might also be concerned that <code>incr_priority</code> could be called on
a vertex that is not in the priority queue at all. But this can't happen because
<code>incr_priority</code> is only called if a shorter path has been found to a
completed vertex <code>v'</code>. By the first invariant, a shorter path cannot exist.</p>
<p>Notice that the first part of the invariant implies that we can use
Dijkstra's algorithm a little more efficiently to solve the simple shortest-path problem in which we're
interested only in a particular destination vertex. Once that vertex is popped
from the priority queue, the traversal can be halted because its recorded distance is correct.
Thus, to find the distance to a vertex <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span>  the traversal only visits the graph
vertices that are at least as close to the source as <span class="equation"><i>v</i></span> 
is.</p>
<h3>Run time of Dijkstra's algorithm</h3>
<p>Every time the main loop executes, one vertex is extracted from the queue.
Assuming that there are <span class="equation"><i>V</i></span>
 vertices in the graph, the queue may contain <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>V</i>)</span>
vertices. Each pop operation takes <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(lg <i>V</i>)</span>
 time assuming the heap implementation
of priority queues. So the total time required to execute the main loop itself
is <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>V</i> lg <i>V</i>)</span>. In addition, we must consider the time spent in the function <code>expand</code>,
which applies the function <code>handle_edge</code> to each outgoing edge.
Because <code>expand</code> is only called once per vertex, <code>handle_edge</code>
is only called once per edge. It might call <code>push(v')</code>, but there can
be at most <span class="equation"><i>V</i></span>
 such calls during the entire execution, so the total cost of that
case arm is at most <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>V</i> lg <i>V</i>)</span>. The other case arm may be called
<span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>E</i>)</span> times,
however, and each call to <code>increase_priority</code> takes <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(lg
<i>V</i>)</span>
 time with
the heap implementation. Therefore the total run time is <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>V</i>
lg <i>V</i> +<i> E</i> lg <i>V</i>)</span>,
which is <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>E</i> lg <i>V</i>)</span> because <span class="equation"><i>V</i></span>
 is <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>E</i>)</span> assuming a connected graph.</p>
<p>(There is another more complicated priority-queue implementation called a <b>Fibonacci
heap</b> that implements <code>increase_priority</code> in <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(1)
</span>time, so that the
asymptotic complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm becomes <span class="equation"><i>O</i>(<i>V</i>
lg <i>V</i> +<i> E</i>)</span>; however,
large constant factors make Fibonacci heaps impractical for most uses.)</p>
