<P>Reductionism and extremism both try to keep things simple.
Reductionism attempts to reduce the complex to the simple, both
in matters of type, kind or form, and causality. Where there are
many types or forms, differing in both minor and major degrees,
reductionism -- unable or unwilling to make distinctions -- claims
there is only one type or form. Where there are many different
causes combining to produce an effect, reductionism insists there
is only one cause. Extremism, the other product of simplistic
thinking, defines an issue only in terms of its two extreme positions,
denying the possible existence of alternative positions between
the two extremes. For the extremist there is no middle ground,
only one extreme or the other. Non-support for one extreme position
is equated with support of the opposite extreme position. The
problem with simplistic thinking, whether reductionism or extremism,
is that in a world of almost infinite complexity and variety it
rarely provides an accurate or truthful portrayal of reality.</P>

<P>This problem is particularly acute in the fields of definition
and categorization. For example, racism -- the subject of this
chapter -- is a term that is frequently subject to simplistic
definitions. It is common to define racism as having only one
cause and existing in only one form, or being of a uniform type.
Definitions that describe a wide variation in types of racism,
and a great diversity in causes or motives for racism, are conspicuous
by their absence. Furthermore, the single uniform type that racism
is usually reduced to in these simplistic definitions is almost
always of an extremist character. In the hope of correcting the
distortions, misconceptions and inaccuracies inherent in simplistic
definitions, a more complete definition of racism, in its variety
of forms, kinds and types, causes and motives, will be presented
here.</P>

<P>Racism can be broadly defined as including any ideology --
or system of ideas, values, ethics and beliefs -- in which race
and racial differences are recognized and regarded as valuable
and important. It can also be defined as the opposite of racial
nihilism, which denies race and racial differences and regards
them as being without value or importance. In terms of causality
or motive racism can be based on a wide variety of opposites,
as can its own opposite -- racial nihilism. It can be based on
love or hate, knowledge or ignorance, idealism or realism, loyalty
or envy, benevolence or malice. <A HREF="#anchor362735">[Note
1]</A><A NAME="anchor368732"></A> These different bases, causes
or motives can themselves interact and blend in such a wide variety
of combinations that it is often difficult to determine which
cause is primary and which secondary. In sum, the motives or reasons
for racism are as varied and complex as anything involving humanity
is likely to be. But for purposes of discussion they can be divided
into the following categories -- factual beliefs, ethical beliefs,
values and emotions.</P>

<P>Racism based on factual beliefs includes the racism based on
the belief that one race is superior to another, as the belief
in racial superiority -- whether factually right or wrong -- is
a factual belief. (This factual belief is often improperly criticized
on ethical rather than factual grounds by racial egalitarians
who demand that all factual beliefs conform to their ethical beliefs.)
Also included in this category is the racism based on the factual
belief in significant racial differences and variation -- independent
of issues of superiority or inferiority -- coupled with the factual
belief that it would be biologically beneficial for life and humanity
to preserve that diversity. The racism based on a religious conviction
that it is fulfilling the divine will is also included in the
category of factual belief.</P>

<P>Racism based on ethical beliefs includes the racism that supports
racial rights and affirms the right of all races to life, independence
(racial self-determination or liberty) and the conditions of racial
separation required for both. At the other end of the ethical
spectrum, but also included in the category of racism based on
ethical beliefs, is the racism which rejects and denies racial
rights in favor of a racial competition for territory, dominance,
mastery and existence -- a struggle for racial survival unrestricted
by moral considerations. This form of racism -- here designated
as <I>immoral </I>racism -- is based on the ethical belief that
there are no racial rights. This belief makes it the opposite
of the racism -- here designated as <I>moral </I>racism -- that
is based on the ethical belief in racial rights. Ironically, racial
nihilism -- the opposite of racism in terms of its denial and
rejection of the importance and value of race -- also denies and
rejects racial rights, sharing this belief in common with immoral
racism, and as a consequence also favors conditions (specifically,
multiracialism) in which racial existence is not protected or
secure, but is threatened with destruction by racial competition,
replacement and intermixture.</P>

<P>Racism based on values includes the racism which regards the
qualities of one race -- usually one's own -- as more important
or desirable than those of other races. Values both influence
and are influenced by -- and are closely connected with -- emotions,
feelings and esthetic sensibilities that are deeply rooted in
the human psyche, often subjective, and perhaps partially innate
or genetic in origin. These can be either positive or negative.
There are innumerable gradations or degrees of both positive and
negative emotions, with love being the most positive and hate
the most negative. There are many different definitions of both
love and hate, but for general purposes love can be defined as
a strong positive emotion or feeling and hate as a strong negative
emotion. In terms of causality, the critics of racism commonly
define it as motivated or caused exclusively by hate, or even
as synonymous with racial hate. But there is both more than one
type of racism and more than one cause. Each type has its own
cause, and each cause creates its own type or form.</P>

<P>The emotions of love and hate are often the positive and negative
poles of the same emotion, for as it is normal to love that which
represents one's values, so it is also normal to hate that which
represents the antithesis of one's values. Similarly, it is normal
to hate that which threatens one's values with harm or destruction.
This type of hate is a derivative emotion of love, with love being
the originating, primary, active and determining emotion, motive
or cause and hate being a derivative, secondary and reactive response
to perceived threats. These two emotions, the one derived from
the other, are often confused as to primacy, but they are different
poles of the same emotion, their existence inseparably connected.</P>

<P>Although the role of love as a cause of racism is seldom admitted
by its critics, who prefer to define racism in strictly negative
terms, the fact is that the forms of racism based on values are
most commonly caused or motivated by the positive emotion of love.
Probably the most common form of racism may be simply defined
as the love of one's race, a positive emotion which evokes feelings
of loyalty to the interests of one's race and a desire to preserve
it. Since the critics of racism presently enjoy a status of cultural
dominance, and usually deny the possibility of any positive motivation
for racism, the existence of the form of racism based on love
for one's race and loyalty to its interests is not generally recognized.
Therefore the most common form of racism is not recognized as
such, and its existence is largely unconscious and invisible,
repressed by cultural norms that discourage the expression of
love for one's race.</P>

<P>The person who loves their own race may or may not love other
races also, but if they do it need not be expected that their
love or positive emotions for other races should be equal to what
they feel for their own. It is normal to have a wide range of
different emotions and feelings for different things, including
different races, to value some more than others, to have preferences,
likes and dislikes, and to discriminate on the basis of those
preferences. It is abnormal to have the same or equal feelings
or emotions for all things, including all races. Yet this is the
egalitarianism of emotions, feelings and esthetic sensibilities,
or emotional reductionism -- the reduction of a complex and diverse
variety of different types, intensities and degrees of emotion
to a single, uniform emotion in accordance with the egalitarian
principles of agapic love -- that racial egalitarianism requires.
It opposes the valuing or loving of one race -- normally one's
own -- more than other races, and condemns as immoral any person
who values or loves one race -- normally their own -- more than
other races, or who values or loves different races unequally,
or in different or unequal degrees.</P>

<P>Racism caused by values and love also includes the racism that
values or loves human racial diversity and consequently supports
racial preservation, and which may or may not love and value all
the diverse races equally in accordance with the egalitarian principles
of agapic love. The love of racial diversity is a love of humanity
which has much in common with the love of nature. The love of
humanity does not require that all the parts of humanity be loved
equally, just as the love of nature does not require that all
the parts of nature be loved equally. Love is not a level emotion,
but an uneven emotion of infinite degrees and variety. Every individual
loves different things differently. It is one of the things that
defines individuality. But it is most natural to love most that
part of nature to which one belongs, the part of which we ourselves
are a part.</P>

<P>As the causality of racism cannot be reduced to a single cause,
so racism cannot be reduced to a single form. The forms of racism
are as varied as the causes. Each cause results in a different
form, each with its own goals and methods, ends and means. For
the moral forms of racism the goal is racial preservation and
continuation, independence and liberty. For the immoral forms
the goal is racial supremacy or mastery -- the ruling, controlling
or subjugation of other races -- often attended by exploitation,
victimization or, in the most extreme versions, genocide or racial
destruction.</P>

<P>The most important distinction between the different types
or forms of racism is the one based on morality. This moral distinction
is determined by their different ethical beliefs, goals or ends,
and methods or means of achieving those goals. There are moral
and immoral ethical beliefs and values, moral and immoral goals
or ends, and moral and immoral methods or means. Morality, like
human rights, is a social construct. It is willed into existence
by the members of a society. Its purpose is to direct and regulate
behavior and relationships so as to serve and promote the general
good, the interests of the society or racial continuum as a whole.
Morality can be positive, requiring certain actions, or negative,
forbidding certain actions, but its purpose remains the same.
In practice morality can be defined as constructive behavior which
promotes the preservation and continuation of life. Immorality
is behavior that is destructive, either of oneself or others,
or of one's own race or other races.</P>

<P>A fundamental principle of morality is respect and support
for the legitimate rights and interests of all, of others as well
as oneself, the famous &quot;Golden Rule&quot; of reciprocity.
In terms of morality, the primary distinction between the different
forms of racism is between those which recognize, affirm, respect,
support and promote the legitimate rights and interests of all
races -- the &quot;Racial Golden Rule&quot; -- and those which
do not. Moral racism does, immoral racism does not. The distinction
between moral and immoral racism is similar to the distinction
between moral and immoral individualism. The defining characteristic
of individualism is the assertion and promotion of individual
rights and interests. The defining characteristic of racism is
the assertion and promotion of racial rights and interests. The
difference or distinction between the moral and immoral forms
of individualism and racism is that the moral forms respect and
promote the rights and interests of all individuals and races,
while the immoral forms only respect the rights and interests
of the subject's own self and race. This excessive subjectivity
results in the denial and violation of the rights and interests
of other individuals and races.</P>

<P>Moral racism can be defined as the recognition, affirmation
and promotion of legitimate racial rights and interests, <A HREF="#anchor363425">[Note
2]</A><A NAME="anchor376433"></A> especially the primary or vital
-- or life-essential -- right of a race to racial life (continued
existence or preservation) and independence (control of its own
life or existence in all spheres -- political, social, economic
and cultural). Immoral racism and racial nihilism can both be
defined as ideologies that deny and violate racial rights, the
difference being that the immoral racist violates the rights of
other races -- sometimes as an end in itself, but more commonly
as a means to the end of benefiting their own race -- while the
racial nihilist denies and violates the rights of all races in
general, and of their own race in particular.</P>

<P>The forms of racism that have traditionally been defined, recognized,
promoted and practiced as racism generally do not recognize or
promote racial rights. Specifically, they have not upheld the
rights of different races to life (continued existence), liberty
(independence) and the pursuit of their own evolutionary destiny,
or to the exclusive possession of their own territory as required
for the realization of these rights. In fact, the forms of racism
that have traditionally been defined and practiced as such have
denied and violated these rights. The extent of their violation
and denial of the rights of other races has varied. Some have
been restricted or governed in some degree by moral considerations,
so their violation of the rights of other races has not been total,
while others have been virtually unchecked by such concerns. Moral
racism has not yet been practiced as the guiding principle of
racial relations.</P>

<P>Before moral racism can be practiced its existence -- or at
least its possibility -- must first be generally recognized. But
the very concept of a moral form of racism is viewed with suspicion
and doubt, or outright denied, in a culture long conditioned to
racial nihilist ideology. The only forms of racism commonly recognized
as existing, or even being possible, are immoral forms, and these
usually of the most extreme varieties. As a result, and fully
consistent with the tenets of reductionism and extremism, the
recognized alternative positions on racial matters have been reduced
to the two extremes of racial nihilism and immoral racism, both
of which deny and violate racial rights.</P>

<P>Extremism views a given matter as limited to two opposite extreme
positions without other alternatives, as one or the other, either-or.
Both extremes on the issue of race claim that there is no alternative
to their position other than the opposite extreme, and deny or
ignore other alternatives, insisting they do not really exist,
or even that they cannot exist. Thus racial nihilism claims that
the only alternative to its multiracialist version of racial destruction
and violation of racial rights is the supremacist version promoted
by immoral racism, and that any deviation from racial nihilism
leads by inexorable extremist logic to acts of genocide against
other races. Likewise, immoral racism claims that the only alternative
to its supremacist version of racial destruction and violation
of racial rights is the multiracialist version promoted by racial
nihilism, and that any opposition to immoral racism is the equivalent
of promoting multiracialism and racial destruction by intermixture
and replacement.</P>

<P>Both claims are typical of the simplistic reductionist view
of causality and form, reducing the complex and diverse to the
simple and uniform. Neither will consider or admit the existence
of an alternative that promotes racial rights, preservation and
independence. Consequently, the racial issue has only been presented
and defined in the form of its two opposite destructive extremes,
with other alternatives or choices denied and excluded from consideration.
The only choice offered is between different versions of racial
destruction. But human racial diversity needs another choice,
a better choice, an alternative that recognizes and defends racial
rights and promotes racial preservation.</P>

<P>The distinction between morality and immorality often coincides
with the distinction between preservation and destruction. Moral
actions and ideas tend to preserve life. Immoral actions and ideas
are more likely to be destructive of life. Races are living things,
forms of life and continuums of life composed of generations of
living things. Therefore those ideas and actions which promote
racial preservation should be presumptively regarded as moral
(i.e., should enjoy a presumption of morality) and those which
promote racial destruction should be presumptively regarded as
immoral. Immoral racism and racial nihilism both promote racial
destruction, although the motive, the method of destruction, and
the identity of the race -- or races -- marked for destruction
are different. Moral racism is the only ideology that promotes
the preservation of all races.</P>

<P>Moral racism is the preservationist middle way, the &quot;golden
mean&quot; between the two opposite destructive extremes. It charts
a racial preservationist course between the Scylla of immoral
racism and the Charybdis of racial nihilism. It is the alternative
choice, the conservationist choice, the position that affirms
racial rights, especially the right of all races to life, liberty
(freedom) and independence (control of its own life). In this
it clearly differs from the two forms of racial extremism -- immoral
racism and racial nihilism -- which deny and violate racial rights.
Immoral racism violates the racial right to freedom and independence
by the practice of racial supremacism, in which one race rules
over, controls or is master of another, and -- in its extreme
forms -- violates the racial right to life by acts of genocide.
Racial nihilism violates the same rights by the practice of multiracialism,
in which the different races are denied the condition of racial
separation required both for continued life and for control of
their own lives.</P>

<P>The existence of moral racism is not generally recognized for
two main reasons. The first is the unwillingness of either of
the two extreme positions on race -- immoral racism and racial
nihilism -- to admit the existence of alternative positions. The
second reason is that moral racism -- the ideology of racial rights,
preservation and independence -- has not yet been consciously
defined and conceptualized, intellectually purified and morally
transvalued. This is a process that all values must go through
before being recognized and persistently practiced -- and thereby
&quot;socially constructed&quot; -- by a &quot;critical mass&quot;
of persons, or a powerful and influential minority, sufficient
to make them normative or dominant. Individualism and individual
rights, as well as environmentalism and conservation, went through
this process before being recognized as values, and so must moral
racism, with its concepts of racial rights and racial conservation.</P>

<P>The essential process of definition and conceptualization,
purification and moral transvaluation, requires above all that
moral racism be clearly distinguished from all other positions
on race, especially the various forms of immoral racism. In this
the situation of racism is similar to that of individualism. The
word individualism can be applied to any ideology that affirms
the value and importance of the individual. It is generally recognized
that there are many forms of individualism, both right and wrong,
moral and immoral. They are distinguished by their different attitude
toward the rights of others. The moral or right forms of individualism
recognize and respect the rights of both other individuals and
the larger society or race of which the individual is a part.
The immoral or wrong forms do not, but deny and violate them.</P>

<P>The fact that there are immoral forms of individualism does
not usually cause people to consider all forms of individualism
to be immoral. In spite of the immoral individualists the mainstream
culture generally sees individualism as a positive value, as morally
right and good, and regards its immoral practitioners as exceptions
to the rule. In modern Western culture individualism is more likely
to have a positive connotation than a negative, more likely to
be regarded as moral than immoral. This is because the moral forms
of individualism have been successfully defined as distinct from
the immoral forms, and so purified of any association or confusion
with them. The same should also be true of racism.</P>

<P>The name racism can be applied to any ideology -- or system
of ideas, beliefs and values -- that affirms the value and importance
of race, or that is based on racial considerations. Like individualism,
racism can be either moral or immoral, depending on its attitude
toward the rights of others. But unlike individualism, the fact
that there can be moral as well as immoral forms of racism is
not generally recognized. Consequently, racism has an almost exclusively
negative image and is routinely regarded as immoral. To be morally
transvalued, and so recognized as moral, the moral forms of racism
need to be successfully defined and conceptualized as clearly
distinct from the immoral forms, purified of any association or
connection with them (other than the fact that they are both based
on race), and thus morally evaluated by a new standard in place
of the conventional standard based on the immoral forms. It will
then be possible for moral racism -- and its concepts of racial
rights, preservation and independence -- to be socially constructed
as a normative or dominant value by the cumulative effect of the
decisions, beliefs and actions of a sufficient &quot;critical
mass&quot; or influential minority.</P>

<P>Individualism in general is characterized by the factual belief
that the individual is unique, important and has value. Moral
individualism adds to this the ethical belief that the individual
has rights, among which are the right to life and the conditions
required for life, the right to control his own life (to rule
or govern his own life), the right to the product of his own labor
(the wealth he has created), the right to his own home, and the
right to reproduce his life, so long as the exercise of these
rights does not conflict with the same rights of others. Racism
in general can be similarly defined as the factual belief that
races are unique, important and have value. Moral racism adds
to this the ethical belief that races have rights, among which
are the right to life and the conditions they require for life,
the right to control their own life and destiny (independence
and self-determination), the right to their own homeland or racially-exclusive
territory, the right to the product of their own labor, and the
right to reproduce their life and culture through their children,
limited only by the provision that the exercise of these rights
does not conflict with the same rights of other races.</P>

<P>The Lockian doctrine of individual rights holds that each person
is a sovereign being, not to be ruled by or to rule over others,
but to rule only their own life. It rejects the doctrine that
some people are justified in ruling over, controlling or being
the masters of others. This is a central concept of moral individualism.
Similarly, moral racism holds that each race is a sovereign entity,
with the right to sole power and control over its own life, existence
and destiny, in all its aspects, not to be ruled by or to rule
over other races. It rejects the doctrine of racial supremacism
-- typical of immoral racism -- that some races are justified,
or have a right, to rule over, control or be the masters of other
races.</P>

<P>As stated above, racism has an almost exclusively negative
or immoral image in the present culture, and for good reason,
since the only forms of racism generally known or recognized are
the immoral forms. It is associated with immoral means or methods,
such as intimidation or physical violence. It is associated with
immoral solutions, ends or goals, such as genocide or enslavement
of other races, or mass expulsion of other races without adequate
provision of a homeland of their own, all of which offend the
most basic civilized sensibilities. Finally, it is associated
with totalitarianism, with the rejection of the political morality
of liberal humanism and its values of democracy, individual rights
and freedom. With regard to immoral racism these associations
are well-founded. With regard to moral racism, however, they are
not, but represent the opposite of its principles, values and
goals.</P>

<P>Racial nihilism often uses extremist logic to morally discredit
all forms of racism by claiming that racism must, if taken to
its logical extreme, result in genocide. Much of the population
has been effectively conditioned to perceive racism only in this
extreme and morally discredited form. This is combined with the
use of reductionist logic to reduce racism to only one monolithic
form -- the morally discredited extremist form -- and deny the
possibility of any other form, especially a morally credible form.
Both extremist and reductionist logic disallow any differentiation
or distinction between different forms. In this matter the proponents
of immoral racism are in agreement with racial nihilism, and are
unwilling to accept the existence of an alternative moral form
of racism. They both use extremist and reductionist logic to discredit
efforts to promote a moral form of racism by claiming that, if
taken to its logical extreme, it cannot be distinguished or differentiated
from immoral racism.</P>

<P>One consequence of the general use of reductionist and extremist
logic to portray racism as monolithic, reducing it to only one
type which represents one extreme of the possible positions on
race, is that the anti-racists who oppose racism rarely qualify
their position by identifying which type or form of racism they
are <I>anti </I>or against -- the moral or right forms that promote
racial rights, liberty and preservation, or the immoral or wrong
forms that promote racial supremacy, exploitation, subjugation,
slavery or destruction. If they are only against the immoral forms
it should be explained that moral racism is also against, or <I>anti</I>
, immoral racism. Only racial nihilism is <I>anti </I>or against
both moral and immoral racism. For racial nihilism there is no
right form of racism. By its standards all racism is wrong, for
it seeks racial destruction and extinction to achieve its goal
of Oneness, of one unified and uniform human race, and therefore
opposes racial diversity, racial rights, preservation and independence
-- the principles of moral racism.</P>

<P>Another consequence of the tendency to portray racism as monolithic,
or limited to only one form, is a tendency to provide only one
definition for racism. Given the preoccupation of the currently
dominant ideology with the promotion of racial egalitarianism,
many of these simplistic definitions of racism place a great emphasis
on the issue of racial equality. Typical of these is the definition
of racism as &quot;A strongly held belief in the ethnic superiority
of one race over all others.&quot; <A HREF="#anchor364499">[Note
3]</A><A NAME="anchor390372"></A></P>

<P>The problem with the above or similar definitions is that they
are based on a factual belief (in racial superiority) rather than
an ethical belief -- on what one believes to be factually true
or false, not on what one believes to be ethically right or wrong
-- whereas moral racism is based more on ethical beliefs than
factual beliefs. It is common for anti-racism to condemn the factual
belief in racial superiority on ethical grounds by citing its
use to justify unethical practices (such as slavery or genocide).
By this logic one's perception of facts should be determined by
the effect one believes they will have on ethical conduct, and
one should deny facts that seem to disagree with one's ethical
values. Ethical judgments should not be made on factual beliefs,
but on ethical beliefs and behavior. Factual beliefs should be
regarded as morally or ethically neutral, neither moral nor immoral
in themselves. Only rigidly reductionist and extremist logic can
assert that a factual belief in racial superiority necessarily
leads to the violation of other races' rights.</P>

<P>The definition of racism as based solely on a belief in racial
inequalities (another word for differences) reflects the obsessive
concern of racial egalitarianism with the enforcement of its central
dogma of racial equality, and hence its practice of defining all
ideas and beliefs in terms of their conformance to that dogma.
Belief in racial equality is usually an act of faith. Unfortunately,
as is so often the case with beliefs based on faith, the believers
are intolerant of the nonbelievers, condemn their nonbelief on
moral grounds, and focus exclusively on this heresy of nonbelief
in their definition of them. Indeed, by their narrow definition
of racism a person who supported racial preservation, independence
and separation, but who did not believe in racial superiority,
would not be considered a racist.</P>

<P>Moral racism is based on the ethical belief in racial rights,
not on a factual belief in racial superiority or inferiority.
The latter belief is irrelevant to moral racism, as it supports
the same racial rights for all races regardless of whether they
are superior or inferior in any trait. The factual belief in racial
superiority is frequently used to justify racial mastery or supremacism,
the rule of a supposedly inferior race by a supposedly superior
race, whose &quot;right&quot; to rule is based on its supposed
superiority. But an ethical belief in racial rights would prevent
the promotion of supremacism even if it were combined with a factual
belief in racial inequality.</P>

<P>Similarly, a race need not be superior or &quot;special&quot;
to be entitled to racial rights, preservation and independence.
Many racial preservationists wrongly assume -- as do many of their
opponents -- that the case for preserving a race depends upon
establishing its superiority or special value relative to other
races. This false assumption is an all too common trap leading
many to engage in a highly partisan criticism of other races and
praise of their own in an effort to establish its greater value.
Thus many of the claims regarding racial superiority and inferiority
can be attributed to the false premise that the preservation and
independence of a race can only be justified by its superiority
to other races. Claims of racial superiority are necessary as
a justification for racial supremacism, the rule of one race over
others, but not for the advocacy of racial rights, preservation
and independence, for which such claims are irrelevant. Under
moral racism all races have an equal right to life and independence
without regard to whether or not they are &quot;special&quot;
or superior.</P>

<P>A person can be a moral racist whether they believe in racial
equality or inequality, superiority or inferiority. Such factual
beliefs are irrelevant to moral racism because it is primarily
based on an ethical belief in racial rights rather than a factual
belief in racial inequality. By its affirmation of the racial
right to life and independence moral racism opposes any form of
supremacism or rule by one race over another, regardless of whether
one race is superior, inferior or equal to the other. Moral racism
supports the above rights for all races, as moral individualism
supports the same rights for all individuals, regardless of whether
they are superior, inferior or equal. A moral racist may love,
value and prefer their own race over others, and they may believe
it is superior to others, but they recognize and support the same
rights of life, liberty (independence) and preservation for all
races, and expect this recognition and support to be reciprocated.</P>

<P>After the reference to a belief in racial inequality, the most
common terms found in definitions of racism are prejudice, bias,
discrimination, hatred, and the prefix <I>anti </I>(against).
The first three terms -- prejudice, bias and discrimination --
are, like the belief in racial inequality, sins against egalitarianism,
violating its demand that all be regarded and treated the same,
without recognition of differences or variation of preference,
love or value. There are many definitions of prejudice, but in
reference to racial relations it often means no more than having
a preference for one's own race, for its traits, qualities and
characteristics, and special concern for its interests. &quot;Bias&quot;
is commonly used to mean the same preference, and the &quot;discrimination&quot;
referred to is based on this preference.</P>

<P>From the perspective of racial nihilism, which denies the value
or importance of race and racial differences and seeks to reduce
them to zero or nothing (<I>nihil</I> ), any preference based
on race is regarded as irrational and unreasonable, arbitrary
and unfair, and, ultimately, as immoral. But all life, all living
things, and all life-forms strive to live and to continue their
life, and the life of their own life-form or kind. This is perhaps
the deepest command of nature, and it presupposes an innate or
inborn preference for one's own life and one's own life-form or
kind. The absence of this preference should probably be regarded
as a defect, potentially fatal to one's own life and the life
of one's own life-form or kind. The existence of this preference
should be regarded as harmful or immoral only to the extent that
it exceeds the legitimate needs and interests of the individual
or life-form possessing it and disregards and violates the legitimate
rights and interests of other individuals and life-forms.</P>

<P>Hatred is the strongest of negative emotions, but negative
emotions or opinions -- including hatred -- are not in themselves
immoral. What is immoral is behavior that disregards, violates
or causes harm to the legitimate rights and interests of others,
or an ideology -- or system of beliefs, values and ideas -- that
sanctions such behavior. Such behavior, and such an ideology,
is immoral whatever its emotional or other motivation, regardless
whether it is motivated by hate or love or anything in-between.
In the present culture love for one's race, preference for one's
race, or the desire to preserve and continue one's race -- including
opposition to racial intermixture and support for the conditions
of racial separation required for racial preservation and independence
-- are often wrongly described as hatred. In fact, much of the
racism described as hatred is simply the unwillingness of members
of one race to intermix with members of other races, and their
resistance to this racially-destructive process, ultimately motivated
by a desire -- whether conscious or subconscious -- for racial
preservation and continuation, separation and independence. In
the absence of any desire to harm the legitimate rights and interests
of other races, this opposition to the destruction of their own
race, or its loss of independence, would be more accurately, and
more fairly, described as motivated by love for their own race
rather than by hatred or ill-will toward other races.</P>

<P>The prefix &quot;anti&quot; means to be against. For the term
to have any moral significance, to be &quot;anti&quot; or against
a certain race or ethnic group must mean to be &quot;anti&quot;
or against the legitimate rights and interests of that race or
ethnic group, and to commit or promote harm to, or promote the
violation of, those rights. An ideology or behavior which recognizes
and respects the legitimate rights and interests of a race or
ethnic group -- especially its primary or vital (life-essential)
rights to life, liberty and the conditions required for its continued
existence and independence, specifically its own territory and
government -- cannot be accurately defined as being &quot;anti&quot;
or against that race or ethnic group in any morally significant
or meaningful sense. Also, to support, promote and advocate the
legitimate rights and interests of one's own race or ethnic group
-- such as its continued life or preservation, its racial liberty
or independence, and its right to its own territory, country or
homeland as required for its continued life and liberty -- cannot
be accurately defined as being &quot;anti&quot; or against any
other race or ethnic group in any morally legitimate sense. Moral
racism affirms and supports the legitimate rights and interests
of all races or ethnic groups, and therefore cannot be accurately
described as being &quot;anti&quot; or against any race or ethnic
group in any morally significant or meaningful sense. It is immoral
racism and racial nihilism that are &quot;anti&quot; or against
-- and which deny, violate or harm -- the vital and primary rights
and interests of races and ethnic groups.</P>

<P>Racism, nationalism and individualism all assert the importance
and value of a specific and particular entity and its right to
be separate, unique and differentiated from the mass rather than
be absorbed into it. They each assert and affirm the identity
and rights of the separate entity, including its right to life
or existence, to independence or control over its own existence,
and to freedom or self-determination, with the only limit on its
rights being that it not violate the same rights of other races,
nations or individuals. Thus one race, nation or individual does
not have a right to cause death or diminishment of life to another,
to rule over another, steal from another, or to invade or take
from another the territory or property that it requires for its
existence and independence. These three ideologies -- or <I>isms
</I>-- are thus all contrary to the various universalisms of the
Oneness creed, such as racial nihilism, which reject and deny
racial and national identity, rights and independence and seek
to absorb all the diverse races and peoples of humanity into one
vast undifferentiated mass.</P>

<P>In racism, nationalism and individualism it is moral to act
in one's own interests provided such action does not violate the
legitimate rights of others. This is the standard of morality
differentiating their moral from their immoral forms. The moral
forms respect the rights of other races, nations and individuals,
the immoral forms do not. If taken to the extreme, immoral racism
can promote genocide just as immoral individualism can promote
murder. Genocide is to racism what murder is to individualism.
They are the antithesis of moral racism and individualism.</P>

<P>According to the extremist forms of immoral racism we must
choose between our race and other races, between destroying other
races or their destroying our race. This is the adversarial concept
of racial relations which typifies immoral racism. According to
this concept (or perception) all races are seen as opponents in
a hostile conflict situation similar to war, a zero-sum competition
where if one race wins the others must lose. Thus immoral racism
naturally assumes a very hostile stance toward other races, often
expressing its attitude toward them in mean-spirited, hateful
and critical terms that convey ill-will and an intent to cause
them harm, to cause them to lose, and to violate their legitimate
rights and interests rather than recognize and respect them. Like
most extremist thinking it is not an accurate portrayal of reality,
and begins and ends with a false premise. In reality there are
other choices -- moral choices -- and other means -- moral means
-- by which racial independence and preservation can be secured.</P>

<P>The most important consideration in the relationships between
different races, as in the relationships between different individuals
or nations, is that they recognize and respect the other's rights
to life, continued existence, independence and self-determination.
For races, the fulfillment of these rights requires a condition
of racial separation, with each race possessing its own exclusive
territory with its own sovereign government. The recognition and
respect of these rights must be regarded as the primary indicator
of good will in racial relationships, to the extent that if this
recognition and respect is not present good will cannot be present
either. A race that denies these rights to another race, or violates
them, cannot be regarded as having good will toward that race.
To deny a race the conditions it requires for existence and freedom
is to wish it ill. To recognize and respect the right of a race
to the conditions it needs for life and independence is to wish
it well.</P>

<P>Moral racism avoids the adversarial concept of racial relations.
If racial rights are recognized all races would be winners in
the sense that all would be secure in their independence and continued
undiminished and undiluted existence in their own homelands. To
seek the continued existence of one race does not require the
nonexistence of another race. It is not either-or, rule or be
ruled, kill or be killed -- the position of extremist immoral
racism. It is not a matter of choosing between the existence of
one or the other. This is a false and unnecessary choice. We can
choose for all races to exist in the future even as all existed
in the past, by restoring and maintaining the conditions (territorial
separation and reproductive isolation) they require for continued
existence.</P>

<P>The mutual recognition of racial rights, the central principle
of moral racism, would foster a cooperative relationship between
races and a common effort to promote and protect racial independence
and preservation. Whereas extremist immoral racism believes that
other races must lose for it to win, moral racism believes that
all races can win, that the interests of all can be served and
protected, so that all can coexist -- which first requires that
they continue to exist -- on the same planet in peace, each in
their own homelands, each in control of their own destiny, each
respecting the rights of the others in accordance with the Racial
Golden Rule.</P>

<P>If there is such a thing as moral progress, and one should
hope there is, then humanity can learn from past errors and enjoy
progress in the moral or ethical sphere much as it has in the
material, technical and scientific spheres. It would not be limited
to the same standards of morality practiced by generations of
past centuries or long-ago millennia. The pre-human law of nature,
the brutal struggle for survival, of rule or be ruled, kill or
be killed, has been superseded by the cumulative efforts of thousands
of generations of humanity to rise above it through the recognition
(or social construction) of human rights and the Golden Rule of
live and let live. Immoral racism applies the law of pre-human
nature to racial relationships. But the relationships between
races can be raised above this brutal law by a morality that respects
and affirms racial rights, just as the relationships between individuals
have been raised above it by the morality that respects and affirms
individual rights. There are limits to how far conduct can deviate
from the laws of nature before the individual or race engages
in conduct that is self-destructive, but within those limits humanity
has sufficient leeway to create a just, humane and civilized society.

<P>Racism is many different things. It covers a multitude of both
sins and virtues. Racial supremacism is racist. Genocide is racist.
But racial independence and preservation are also racist. So is
valuing and loving one's race, being loyal to its interests and
desiring its continued existence and control over its own destiny.
The extremist claim that all forms of racism lead to genocide,
coupled with the reductionist assertion that there is only one
-- immoral -- form of racism, is a preemptive accusation often
used to discredit, suppress and prevent any consideration of alternatives
to the present destructive course of racial nihilism, especially
any attempt to promote racial preservation and independence.</P>

<P>Reductionist logic was typical of the dogmatic thinking of
medieval times when all alternatives were reduced to a Manichaean
choice between good and evil -- either obeying church dogma or
being in league with the satanic powers of darkness. In the reductionist
logic of the dominant orthodoxy of the modern world all alternatives
are reduced to a similarly Manichaean choice -- either obeying
the dogma of racial nihilism or being in league with the evil
powers of racial supremacism and genocide. With all other alternatives
eliminated by the successful use of extremist and reductionist
logic to produce such powerful Manichaean imagery, racial nihilism
has enjoyed a position of virtually unchallenged cultural dominance.</P>

<P>That the future existence of human racial diversity is now
imperiled is largely due to the success of racial nihilism in
denying the existence of any alternatives to itself other than
immoral racism. People are limited by the choices they are given.
They cannot choose a moral alternative if they are unaware that
it exists or is possible. So it has been with much of the immorality
of the past and the present. Only if a sufficient number of people
are aware of real moral alternatives to the immoral status quo
can the future avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</P>

<P>Racial nihilism has a dream of a future in which race is not
important, a dream in which separate races and racial diversity
do not exist. It is the dream of Oneness, the merging or blending
of all races into one uniform race where all the distinct traits
and qualities created by divergent evolution -- and whatever creative
force, cause or purpose might be behind that evolution -- would
be destroyed. It is the ultimate reductionist dream, a dream of
racial reductionism, of reducing the many different races to one
race, the diversity of humanity to uniformity.</P>

<P>But racial nihilism is not the only possible dream of the racial
future. There are other dreams. Moral racism also has a dream.
It is a dream of racial preservation and independence, of continued
racial existence and liberty, for all the diverse races of humanity,
sharing the world together in mutual respect for the legitimate
rights of their fellow races.</P>

<P>Moral racism supports friendly cooperation among races in matters
of joint concern and mutual benefit. It also supports the right
of each race to its own secure, separate and exclusive territory,
country or homeland as required for its continued life and independence.
It would encourage the diverse races of humanity to share the
earth as good neighbors, recognizing that a good neighbor is one
that respects the rights of others to the secure possession of
their own piece of earth and to the conditions required for their
continued existence. It is the racism that preserves, as opposed
to immoral racism, the racism that destroys.</P>

<P>The dream of racial nihilism, the dream of Oneness, is a dream
of racial reduction and destruction, promoted in the name of combating
another form of racial destruction which is claimed to be its
only alternative. The dream of moral racism is a dream of continued
racial life and racial preservation. Moral racism -- the morally
right or righteous form of racism -- is the alternative to racial
nihilism that must be considered as a matter of the utmost urgency,
as a matter of nothing less than racial life or death. It has
not been practiced in the past, but in the moral development of
humanity it must be hoped that a stage has now been reached where
it can become the practiced morality of the present and the future.
The future existence of at least one race depends upon it.</P>

These forms of pseudo-racism, as they are not really based on

racial nihilism, which evades the central concerns of race by
denying their reality, prefers to attribute racism to non-racial
motives, and can therefore only provide explanations that focus
on such peripheral distractions. There are many different forms

of the tree of knowledge it often happens that the newly acquired
knowledge, at least for a certain period of time, increases confusion
and error as much as understanding and wisdom. So it was with
Charles Darwin's epochal revelation of the mechanisms of biological
evolution. Many learned the wrong lesson, or took the right lesson
to excess, and rushed to apply the newly revealed practices and
logic of pre-human evolutionary struggle or natural selection
to human society. This school of thought, called Social Darwinism,
wrongly assumed that the discovery of more ancient behavioral

and justified a rejection of the moral concepts of civilized existence
in favor of a return to the morality that existed before civilization,
or to the even earlier behavior of pre-human animal existence.</FONT></P>

of existence should be used to identify and discard those distortions
of morality which are destructive of life, not the advances in

seek to maintain a harmonious balance between the laws of nature

of life and evolutionary progress with the desires of humanity
