#	The package includes a computation of all the local invariants of the
,	system, a regularization procedure and an index reduction scheme and
,	it can be combined with every solution method for standard index 1
,	systems. Nonuniqueness and inconsistencies are treated in a least
,	square sense. In our package we have implemented backward
,	differentiation formulas (BDF) methods and Runge-Kutta schemes.
