This page is supposed to hold all sorts of information
about the late great Soviet mainframe computer BESM-6. The last original BESM-6 at the Naval Training Center near St. Petersburg was decommissioned Oct. 28 2008. For indexing and search purposes
I'll mention БЭСМ-6 in Russian.
<p><font size=-1>
By the way, BESM stands for "Bol'shaya (or Bystrodejstvuyushchaya) Ehlektronno-Schetnaya Mashina",
that is, "Big (or High-speed) Electronic Calculating Machine". There also existed
BESM-4 (with 45-bit words), and I've even seen it once;
but I don't know anything else about it.</font>

<font color=#0000F0 size=+1>I hope that this page will eventually
persuade somebody to reimplement BESM-6, e.g. as a term project
(not down to the chip, of course; down to layout with timings).
It will be interesting to see how fast it can be today and how many
transistors will be necessary.

<img src="brz.gif" align=center alt="Picture of the cache registers" width="560" height="101">
<p>The CPU had all its registers represented on the front panel
by the neon lights; there were 8 48-bit cache registers neatly
aligned - a perfect way for the kernel to communicate with 
operators "if everything else fails". Today we have to count
beep signals from the BIOS.

<h3>Here is some brief history</h3>

<p>
BESM-6 was designed in 1965 by a group of engineers working at the
S.A.Lebedev Institute of Precise Mechanics and Computing Equipment
(ITMiVT in Russian). One of them was Mark Tyapkin, who is still with IPMCE,
afaik.
<p>
The production started in 1967, by the "SAM Plant" (SAM stands for
"Computing-Analytical Machines") in Moscow.
The base configuration included CPU, 192 Kb of core memory,
magnetic drums, proprietary magnetic tape drives, teletypes, typewriters
(with parallel interface), alphanumeric <a href=#trivia>printers</a> and punchcard/punchtape readers and writers.
About 350 copies have been made until early 80's. The later configurations
included standard 1/2 inch tapes and IBM-clone magnetic disc drives,
serial videoterminals, plotters, etc, mostly imported or clones of
the original hardware.
<p>The main purpose of BESM-6 was "number crunching", so it did not have
any specific instructions for character manipulation. The memory could only
be addressed word by word.
<p>There were one or more compilers for most widespread programming
languages: Algol-60 (3), Fortran (at least 3), Pascal (2) -
those I've used; then, there were many more.
Off the top of my head:  APL, Lisp, Planner, REFAL, Forth, C -
those I've seen working, heard of or read about.
<p>An extension of BESM-6 (named AS-6) better suited for character manipulation
has been designed, but only several (4-5) copies have been made. (I have no
information on the AS-6 instruction set extensions. Anyone?)
<p>
Later, with the advent of Elbrus in early 80's, a newer and faster IC-based version
of BESM-6 was produced as a part of the Elbrus-1 configuration; its name
was Elbrus-1K2 officially ("Elbrus" being the trademark of ITMiVT),
and SVS, which stands for "System reproducing the instruction set
(of BESM-6)", unofficially. It was about 2.5 times faster than BESM-6.
<p>
During late 80's, the 64-bit extension of BESM-6 (named Elbrus-1KB, or,
briefly, Elbrus-B), featuring the new native
instruction set and 2 BESM-6 compatibility modes (original, and with
extended memory addressing), was designed
and several copies have been made (by the same "SAM plant" that used to
make the original BESM-6's) before the collapse of the USSR.
One Elbrus-B has been used in the Meteorological Center in Moscow in 1991;
I'm unaware of its today's fate.
<p>
The element base used for Elbrus-B was hardly better than one of SVS
(that is, more than 10 years older than state of the art),
and its floating point performance,
although impressive (for 20 MHz clock frequency) 2.5 MWhetstones on 64-bit
arithmetic, was too low to be competitive.
<p>
The <a href=#techinfo>table</a> below shows how the slippage from
state of the art progressed. This page will focus on describing BESM-6
and, hopefully, SVS.

<p>
The most interesting features of BESM-6 were:<ul>
<li> Pipelined CPU (separate pipelines for CU and AU), therefore, unexact
FPE interrupts;
<li> Virtual memory addressing and paging capability
(with expandable page registers, so latest machines had up to several
megabytes of SRAM);
<li> Combined integer and floating point arithmetic unit: actually,
there was no specific instructions to perform integer arithmetic.
Floating point with suppressed normalisation was used for this purpose,
therefore integer division was tricky (does it resemble RISCs?);
<li> Each memory word had two parity bits - one for each half, the combined
parity for the whole word must have been odd. Thus, the distinction
between code and data was achieved: one had the halfword parities
even-odd, the other - odd-even, so code overwriting or branches to
data got caught as soon as an offending instruction was executed.
(The program had to ask the kernel to switch the mode of the store
instruction to "code" before generating executable code, or to use
a special system call, so using self-modifying code was discouraged.);
<li> The instruction timing was closer to RISC's than to CISC's. Most
boolean and arithmetic instructions (not multiplication and division, of course)
required 2 cycles in CU and about 5 (in average) cycles in AU;
<li> Breakpoint and watchpoint registers.
</ul>

<h3>Trivia</h3>
<p>
<h4>Printers</h4>
The printers connected to BESM-6 were similar to those old IBM line
printers with a big rotating character drum and a lot of little hammers,
and the interface was similar to the one used for IBM 1132:
an interrupt was generated when
a row of characters on the drum was ready to be struck with the hammers,
and the OS had to send a bitmap of the hammers to hit the drum to
the printer no later than 200 us after the interrupt, or it's too late - the drum keeps rotating!
That is, the interrupt rate from one printer was about
700 per second (that corresponds to approximately 6 lines per second), there were two of them, and even with both printers printing,
the decrease in responsiveness of the system was barely noticeable.
