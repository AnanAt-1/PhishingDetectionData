    Sustainable farming practices are gaining traction globally, with the aim of enhancing food security, biodiversity, and climate resilience. Among the crops that play a significant role in these practices, wheat stands out due to its diverse varieties and adaptability. This blog delves into how different wheat varieties contribute to sustainable farming.
Wheat Varieties and Soil Health
Healthy soils are fundamental for sustainable farming. Certain wheat varieties, such as winter wheat, can be used as cover crops in the off-season to prevent soil erosion, retain nutrients, and suppress weeds.

    Poultry grit is essential if you are keeping chickens. Without it, they may be unable to digest their food. There are many types of grit on the market, but they fall into two main groups — soluble and insoluble. If you are unsure which sort you should be buying, here is a quick guide to each type.
Insoluble grit
The first main type of grit is insoluble. This means that it doesn't break down inside the bird's stomach.

    You might have purchased almonds in the past plenty of times. However, you might have never actually purchased them from a bulk almond supplier before. There are many people and businesses that can benefit greatly from ordering almonds in bulk, however. These are a few examples of those who should think about buying almonds in this way.
Families That Eat a Lot of Almonds
You might think that the only people who purchase almonds in bulk are people who are buying them for business-related purposes.

    If you have recently ventured into farming, one of the first pieces of equipment that you need to purchase is a tractor. These pieces of machinery come in a vast range of options so you may be confused as to what will be best suited to your individual farming needs if you are new to the industry. And while you may be tempted to let your budget decide for you, this is not the right approach to take if you are intent of buying a reliable tractor that will serve you for years to come.

    Many measures can be taken to improve the quality of the pelletised feed that you give to your livestock. This article discusses some of the changes that farmers who make their own pelleted stock feed can implement to improve the quality of those pellets.&nbsp;
Increase the Conditioning Temperature
The quality of pelleted stock feed can be improved by increasing the temperature at which the feeds are conditioned after all the ingredients are mixed.

        <p>My name is Katherine, and three years ago, my husband and I decided to sell everything, leave the city and start our own family farm. I absolutely love it, but it is challenging. I wanted to start a blog for other small scale farmers. Here, I plan to post about our experiences and lots of tips about everything from choosing seeds to tilling dirt and getting the kids to help. Please, grab a cup of tea, get comfortable and start reading. I typically write these posts with three kittens on my lap and multiple interruptions from my kids, so I ask for your forgiveness in advance if there are any typos. Thanks for reading and enjoy!</p>
