<p>75.63 miles [<a href="#fn">1</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="FHWA Interstate Route Log, Oct. 31, 2002">]; from I-5 near Tracy to US 101 in San Rafael. I-580 does seem a
Frankenstein's monster of several freeways: the Altamont pass road, a rural
eight-lane highway now serving hapless commuters for whom a two-hour commute
is the price of affordable housing; a foothill freeway through Oakland;
a new section (opened in 1990) past the shipping docks in
Richmond; over a narrow bridge to San Quentin and Marin County.
</p>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>Interstate System Designation</h3>
<p class="first">Interstate 580 from Oakland eastward is part of California's initial
system of interstate highways, submitted by the state June 27, 1945, and
approved August 7, 1947. The original proposal lists Modesto as the
eastern terminus, because CA 99 was the original proposed location of
Interstate 5. [<a href="#fn">6</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="&quot;History of California's Interstate Routes.&quot; California Department of Transportation, November 1984.">] No numbers were assigned until the mid-1950s.
</p>
<p>In September 1955, the routing was moved (from the Nimitz Freeway, CA 17) to a proposed
MacArthur Freeway, which was eventually built.
In November 1957, the eastern end was moved with I-5 from Modesto to Tracy.
In April 1978, CA 17 from I-80 to San Rafael was designated Interstate 180 -- a
temporary designation. The CA 17 signs remained, because since CA 180 already existed. [<a href="#fn">4</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Rouse, Joe. &quot;I-880 Was Not Stolen From Sacramento.&quot; Online posting. 22 Oct 1997. news:misc.transport.road">]
Interstate 180 was changed to I-580 on July 7, 1983.
</p>
<p>According to the FHWA, there are still 0.7 miles to be constructed on I-580, between
milepost 12.50 and 13.20. The only notation in the July 1998 bulletin is "Alameda Spur".
I'm not sure what that's about. [<a href="#fn">7</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="&quot;Bulletin: ... status of development as of December 31, 1997.&quot; Federal Highway Administration, Jan. 7, 1998.">]
</p>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>Altamont Pass/Diablo Valley</h3>
<p class="first">The original four-lane divided Altamont Pass highway, from San Leandro eastward,
opened on August 4, 1938, as part of US 50.
I-580 is now eight lanes in that section, and needs them all.
The pass is well known for its forest of propellers for wind power.
</p>
<p>The interchange at I-680 in Dublin was originally a plain cloverleaf with collector-distributor
roads -- underpowered for two busy freeways. A flyover ramp from southbound 680
to eastbound 580 opened there in February 2002, part of an interchange revamp that
will finish a year early and $1 million under budget. [<a href="#fn">8</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="&quot;ACTA celebrates giant I-580/680 success.&quot; Press release, Alameda County Transportation Authority (ACTA), Feb. 13, 2002.">]
</p>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>Oakland/East Bay</h3>
<p class="first">I-580 between I-5 and I-80 was once part of a planned I-5W loop, along
with <a href="i505.html#505ca">I-505</a>; that idea was scuttled in about 1964. Mike Ballard
has seen a photo of I-580 signed as I-5W, which would have been around
1962. Sections of I-580 started opening in the mid-1960s. Until the
mid-1980s (see below), I-580 ended at the "MacArthur Maze" interchange
with I-80 at the Bay Bridge approach.
</p>
<p>The $45 million revamped interchange with <a href="ix38.html#238ca">I-238</a>, where I-580
eastbound crawls overhead like a centipede, was completed in 1989.
Contrary to what was said here before, this is not the interchange featured
on a Doobie Brothers album.
</p>
<p>Originally four lanes wide through Castro Valley, I-580 was
reconstructed some time ago with the intent to widen to eight lanes.
However, environmental litigation held that up; meanwhile, Caltrans,
needing to rebuild the highway anyway, went ahead with a compromise:
build it eight lanes wide, but leave four lanes closed off. When the
lawsuit was resolved, the lanes were opened. [<a href="#fn">16</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Oscar Voss. &quot;Re: Wide open wasted pavement on Interstates.&quot; Online posting, misc.transport.road, Sept. 11, 2003.">]
</p>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>Richmond-San Rafael</h3>
<p class="first">The 4.0-mile Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, double-decked and a narrow 2 lanes in each
direction, opened in 1956 as part of CA 17. The 12.8-mile stretch of 
Highway 17 between I-80 and US 101 was
given Interstate status in 1978 (as unsignposted Interstate 180), and officially
became part of I-580 in 1983.
</p>
<p>In 1985, new I-580 signs started going up. 580 was still not a freeway in the Richmond
docks area, though plans had been in the works since the 1950s.
The 6-lane John T. Knox freeway in this area broke ground in Feb. 1985.
This non-freeway portion was signed
"Temp I-580" until the freeway opened in 1990. [<a href="#fn">5</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Wiley, Mike">]
</p>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>Fixing the left exit at Albany</h3>
<p class="first">The I-580 exit from I-80, at the I-80/580 split in Albany, had been a
left exit since the US 40 days. In late July 1998, as part of
reconstruction between there and the I-880 interchange, Caltrans moved
the exit to the right-hand side. Confused traffic backed up for four
miles, proving that Caltrans need not spend much money on signs because
no one reads them. Here's a good quote from the San Francisco
Chronicle:<br>
"'The change is stupid if you ask me,' said Shauna Harris, who was driving to Marin Sunday
when she almost crashed her red BMW trying to muscle her way over to the right side of I-80
in order to make the I-580 split."
</p>
<p>Whatever Ms. Harris' other qualities, she wraps up a number of annoying
Bay Area personality traits - she thinks she shouldn't have to read
signs (and how dare Caltrans design roads without consulting her); she
likes to flaunt her comparative wealth (a red Beemer, "4U2NV"); her time
is more important than yours (she almost caused an accident because she
didn't want to backtrack).
</p>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>Fixing the 580/680 interchange</h3>
<p class="first">The interchange at <a href="i680.html#680ca">I-680</a> in Dublin was originally a cloverleaf, dating
back to the days when I-580 was US 50 and I-680 was CA 21. In 1986, Alameda county
passed a half-cent tax increase to fund several highway projects, including
a new flyover from 680 south to 580 east. At the time, this was the most
congested traffic movement. [<a href="#fn">13</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Richards, Gary. &quot;Mr. Roadshow.&quot; Weekly column, San Jose Mercury News, May 13, 2002.">]
</p>
<p>In Feb. 2002, the project was completed, and it is quite popular. [<a href="#fn">12</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="&quot;ACTA celebrates giant I-580/680 success.&quot; Press release, Alameda County Transportation Authority (ACTA), Feb. 13, 2002.">] However, now most
traffic comes from the Central Valley to the South Bay, stressing the 580 west
to 680 south loop; it seems a natural idea to provide a flyover there as well.
Unfortunately, there are no such plans today. [<a href="#fn">13</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Richards, Gary. &quot;Mr. Roadshow.&quot; Weekly column, San Jose Mercury News, May 13, 2002.">]
</p>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>Names</h3>
<p class="first">West of I-80, 580 is called the John T. Knox Freeway , after a State Legislator. Named by Senate
Concurrent Resolution 50, Chapt. 78 in 1980.
</p>
<p>Between I-80 and I-238, it's called the MacArthur Freeway, after General
Douglas MacArthur of WW II and the Korean War. MacArthur Boulevard (old
US 50) was named for the general in the 1950's.

<p>This is a former numbering for what is now US 75 north of <a href="i480.html#480ne">I-480</a> in Omaha.
The 4-mile freeway would have connected two limited access roads, one to the airport,
one to NW Omaha/Fremont. This route was actually signed I-580 for a while. However,
federal interstate standards for the 480/580 interchange would have doubled the cost
of constructing it. Omaha and the state declined, and removed the 580 signs on
the 2 miles of existing freeway from I-480 to Lake St. [<a href="#fn">10</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Hynes, Damon">]
</p>
<p>At least part of I-580 was approved around 1976, and right-of-way acquisition
was to start between Lake and Fort Streets in 1977. [<a href="#fn">19</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="&quot;1977 Road Costs Total $101 Million.&quot; Lincoln [Neb.] Star, July 29, 1976.">]
</p>
<p>In fall 2004, Nebraska Department of Roads began reconstruction of the 480/old 580 interchange.
Work includes removing ghost ramps to the cancelled West Freeway, elimination of left
exits, and modification of roadways with inadequate design speeds. [<a href="#fn">18</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Widden, Jesse. &quot;I-480.&quot; Online posting, misc.transport.road, US 75 interchange reconstruction in Omaha/Jan. 13, 2004.">]

<a href="http://home.pyramid.net/burghart/questions.html">Reno Quiz:
100 Things Every Reno-Sparks Resident Should Know</a> is simply: "Where is Interstate 580?"
</p>
<p>Nevada DOT plans to extend I-580 southward to the Bowers Mansion cutoff
at Washoe City by about 2007. [<a href="#fn">11</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Nevada DOT. &quot;[I-580 extension] Project History and Overview.&quot; Web page, http://www.freewayextension.com/site/hist.html.">] This will connect completed portions
with the constructed portion near I-80 and a planned Carson City bypass,
which will be complete around 2010.
</p>
<p>If you're wondering: "wasn't this freeway already signed 580 at one time?"
you're right: Interstate 580 appeared on some signs and some maps in the 1980s.
Rand McNally maps in 1985 and 1987 marked I-580, but do
not now. Surface streets approaching US 395 interchanges included I-580 signs
for about a year during the early 1980s, but were taken down.
(There were never any I-580 signs on US 395 itself or on I-80). [<a href="#fn">14</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Herron, Robert. &quot;Interstate 580 - Nevada (UPDATE).&quot; Email to Kurumi. 16 Sept 2002.">]
</p>
<p>Even today, small reference markers on US 395 say "IR 580." [<a href="#fn">2</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Field, Andrew. &quot;Great web page!&quot; Personal email, March 2, 1997. See also: his great web page :-)">]
</p>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>History</h3>
<p class="first">The idea for a US 395 freeway dates back to the 1950's. A Wilbur Smith &amp; Associates 1960
proposal also called for an Outer Belt Highway where McCarran Blvd. is now. [<a href="#fn">9</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Wilbur Smith &amp; Associates, Major Street and Highway Plan, Truckee Meadows/Washoe County, 1960.">]
The US 395 freeway in Reno opened in 1979.
</p>
<p>Planning in Washoe County dates back to 1957. The first segment opened in the early
1960s, but environmental issues held up the Winters Ranch to Glendale Avenue segment,
delaying work there until the 1980s. Opening dates:
</p><ul>
<li>Carson City/Washoe County line to Lakeview: 1964
<li>Lakeview to Winters Ranch: 1970
<li>Panther Valley to Glendale Avenue: 1973
<li>Glendale Avenue to South Virginia Street: 1980
<li>South Virginia Street to Mt. Rose Highway: 1983-1998
<li>Mt. Rose to Bowers Mansion Cutoff: construction starts soon
</ul>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>Extension toward Carson City</h3>
<p class="first">Nevada had planned to extend I-580 to Carson City by about 2005, but this was delayed.
NDOT's current plan for the Carson City Bypass as of fall 2002:
</p><ul>
<li>Phase 1: 3.8 miles, from US 395 connection to US 50; four lanes; starting fall 2003, ending
around 2006 [<a href="#fn">17</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="&quot;Carson City freeway work begins.&quot; Reno [Nev.] Gazette-Journal, Oct. 1, 2003. ">]
<li>Phase 2: 4.9 miles, from US 50 to US 50 at S. Carson St; around 2010
</ul>
<p class="first" style="margin-top: 0.5em"></p><h3>So what about the 580 numbering??</h3>
<p class="first">NDOT's position (fall 2002) is to sign I-580 from I-80 south through Carson City; i.e.
to the end of the planned bypass freeway. This would happen when the highway is completed,
around 2008. The state does not plan to sign I-580 north of I-80. [<a href="#fn">14</a><img src="note.gif" width=12 height=10 alt="note" title="Herron, Robert. &quot;Interstate 580 - Nevada (UPDATE).&quot; Email to Kurumi. 16 Sept 2002.">].
