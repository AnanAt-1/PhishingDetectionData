  <p>If you think you know it all in the C++ world, it must mean you&rsquo;re
  not talking to your colleagues very much. If I had any pretensions to knowing
  it all when I wrote my assignment-operator article ("<a href=
  "the_anatomy_of_the_assignment_operator.html">The Anatomy of the Assignment
  Operator</a>," <i>C++ Report,</i> Nov/Dec 1997), they didn&rsquo;t last long
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>The assignment-operator article drew a huge response, with a lot of people
  sending me corrections and disagreements of various kinds. The issues have
  been mounting up, so I thought maybe a follow-on article to discuss the
  issues would be appropriate.</p>

  <h3>The big mistake</h3>

  <p>One I heard about almost instantly from several people (and which
  I&rsquo;m really glad I heard about before delivering a talk on this subject
  at C++ World) was a rather serious mistake. When I first did this article, I
  had the big "right answer" like this:</p>
  <pre>
TFoo&amp;
TFoo::operator=(const TFoo&amp; that)
{
    if (this != &amp;that) {
        TSuperFoo::operator=(that);
        TBar* bar1 = 0;
        TBar* bar2 = 0;

        try {
            bar1 = new TBar(*that.fBar1);
            bar2 = new TBar(*that.fBar2);
        }
        catch (...) {
            delete bar1;
            delete bar2;
            throw;
        }

        delete fBar1;
        fBar1 = bar1;
        delete fBar2;
        fBar2 = bar2;
    }
    return *this;
}
</pre>

  <p>This was wrong, and it was caught in the review process. The problem here
  is that if you&rsquo;re trying to transactionize the assignment, so that
  either all of it happens or none of it happens, this breaks that. If an
  exception occurs trying to new up <tt>bar1</tt> or <tt>bar2</tt>, the
  <tt>TFoo</tt> part of the object won&rsquo;t have changed, but the
  <tt>TSuperFoo</tt> part will have. The call to
  <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt> can&rsquo;t go at the top of the
  function.</p>

  <p>As I said, this was caught during the review process. So when the article
  ran, this example looked like this:</p>
  <pre>
TFoo&amp;
TFoo::operator=(const TFoo&amp; that)
{
    if (this != &amp;that) {
        TBar* bar1 = 0;
        TBar* bar2 = 0;

        try {
            bar1 = new TBar(*that.fBar1);
            bar2 = new TBar(*that.fBar2);
        }
        catch (...) {
            delete bar1;
            delete bar2;
            throw;
        }

        TSuperFoo::operator=(that);
        delete fBar1;
        fBar1 = bar1;
        delete fBar2;
        fBar2 = bar2;
    }
    return *this;
}
</pre>

  <p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s wrong too. The problem is we&rsquo;re still
  hosed if <tt>TSuperFoo</tt>&rsquo;s assignment operator can also throw an
  exception, which is a reasonable thing to expect. If we succeed in creating
  our <tt>TBar</tt> objects, but <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt> fails to
  create whatever he needs to (presumably he&rsquo;s also transactionized), the
  object will correctly be left untouched, but we&rsquo;ll leak the new
  <tt>TBars</tt> we created. So the <i>right</i> answer (he said sheepishly) is
  this:</p>
  <pre>
TFoo&amp;
TFoo::operator=(const TFoo&amp; that)
{
    if (this != &amp;that) {
        TBar* bar1 = 0;
        TBar* bar2 = 0;

        try {
            bar1 = new TBar(*that.fBar1);
            bar2 = new TBar(*that.fBar2);
            TSuperFoo::operator=(that);
        }
        catch (...) {
            delete bar1;
            delete bar2;
            throw;
        }

        delete fBar1;
        fBar1 = bar1;
        delete fBar2;
        fBar2 = bar2;
    }
    return *this;
}
</pre>

  <p>The call to <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt> has to go inside the try.
  Notice that it goes <i>after</i> we create the new <tt>TBars</tt>. We want to
  make sure creating the <tt>TBar</tt>s has succeeded before we call
  <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt> because <tt>TSuperFoo::operator=()</tt> might
  succeed, changing the object, and we only want to change the object if we can
  carry out the whole assignment operation.</p>

  <p>One interesting consequence of this is that you can imagine a class with a
  fairly deep inheritance chain where every class up the chain has other
  objects it owns. You&rsquo;d call an assignment operator low in the chain,
  it&rsquo;d create the objects it needs, then it&rsquo;d call its parent,
  which would create the objects it needs and call <i>its</i> parent, and so on
  up the chain. Eventually, all of the new objects would have been created and
  would be pointed to by temporary variables on the stack. Then, at the root
  level, the assignment would finally begin to be carried out, with objects
  being deleted and the object&rsquo;s data members being changed as each
  function returned. So the allocations happen in one order and the assignments
  and deletions happen in reverse order, which feels kind of awkward at first
  glance, but it gets the job done. It also means that there has to be enough
  free memory to hold two instances of every subobject, but there really
  isn&rsquo;t a safe way around allocating all the extra memory.</p>

  <p>By the way, I&rsquo;ve also had several people question my assumption that
  the delete operations won&rsquo;t throw exceptions. Technically they&rsquo;re
  right, but I&rsquo;d strongly counsel against letting this happen. I think
  it&rsquo;s wise to declare "Destructors will not throw exceptions, nor will
  they allow exceptions thrown by functions they call to propagate out of them"
  to be a program invariant. The reason for this is that destructors are called
  in the course of <i>handling</i> exceptions. If exception-handling code can
  throw more exceptions, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult, if not downright
  impossible, for everyone to properly clean up after himself, and extremely
  difficult for the program to completely recover from the error condition and
  go on. Therefore, throwing or propagating exceptions from within destructors
  is not a good idea.</p>

  <h3>The magic three</h3>

  <p>In my previous article, I singled out C++&rsquo;s "magic three" functions,
  the default constructor, copy constructor and default assignment operator and
  said that one should always define them. This has raised a few hackles.</p>

  <p>First, several people correctly pointed out that the default constructor
  is only defined by the compiler when you don&rsquo;t create <i>any other</i>
  constructors. This is indeed true; I left this fact out for simplicity. In
  retrospect, I shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>

  <p>Several people took exception to my statement that every class should
  define the "magic three." They were disturbed by the suggestion that every
  object should have a default constructor. They&rsquo;re right. There are
  probably more objects for which it isn&rsquo;t appropriate to have a default
  constructor than there are for which it is. Oftentimes, you can&rsquo;t
  initialize an object to a meaningful state without some data being supplied
  from outside, or you can only do it by adding special-case code just to
  support a default constructor you don&rsquo;t really need.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, you even have a default constructor forced on you.
  Taligent&rsquo;s CommonPoint system did this: its serialization facilities
  required a default consructor to work right, one of the bigger architectural
  gaffes in that system, in my opinion (of course, now I&rsquo;ll get angry
  letters from ex-Taligent people explaining why it had to be that way).</p>

  <p>I think what I really meant to say in the original article didn&rsquo;t
  come through strong enough: You should always <i>declare</i> the magic three
  functions. This way, you make an explicit statement that you are not
  accepting the default implementations of these functions. If a default
  constructor isn&rsquo;t appropriate for your class, don&rsquo;t write one
  just for the sake of writing one; declare it private and give it an empty
  implementation. But be sure you declare it. Same goes for the copy
  constructor and assignment operator.</p>

  <p>A number of people also suggested an improvement to my original advice:
  "If you don&rsquo;t want it, declare it private and give it an empty
  implementation." You actually don&rsquo;t have to give an unwanted function
  an implementation at all. You can declare the function private and not define
  it. The declaration will suppress the compiler-generated version of the
  function, but not defining it saves you from having to supply dummy code that
  doesn&rsquo;t actually do anything and will never get called. Furthermore,
  while declaring the function private will prevent outside classes from
  calling it, it won&rsquo;t prevent <i>the same class</i> from calling it. If
  you don&rsquo;t supply an implementation, the class will get a link error if
  it calls its own unwanted magic functions. This is somewhat nonintuitive to
  debug, but it&rsquo;s better than having the compiler silently let the caller
  get away with calling a function nobody&rsquo;s supposed to call.</p>

  <p>I also had people take rather violent exception to my suggestion that one
  should always define the copy constructor and assignment operator, even when
  they really do what you want them to do. They pointed out that it&rsquo;s a
  lot of wasted boilerplate code, which is ugly and a pain to maintain.
  Furthermore, it&rsquo;s possible for the compiler to perform optimizations on
  the default functions that it might not be able (or willing) to perform on
  user-written code. Most importantly, if you add or delete members from the
  class, the default copy constructor and assignment operator pick up the
  changes automatically. If you define these functions yourself, you have to
  remember to maintain them when the class definition changes, or you&rsquo;ll
  have compiler errors or runtime bugs.</p>

  <p>This is all very true, but I&rsquo;ll stand by my original advice just the
  same. Boilerplate copy constructors and assignment operators are ugly code
  and a hassle to maintain, but being in the habit of always writing the copy
  constructor and assignment operator also puts you in the habit of thinking
  about just what the correct copy behavior is for all the members of your
  class. If all the members are integers, this probably isn&rsquo;t a big deal,
  but if they&rsquo;re pointers, it&rsquo;s a very big deal. Getting into the
  habit of accepting the defaults without taking the time to think about it can
  also lead to bugs down the road if you mistakenly accept the default when it
  <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> do the right thing.</p>

  <p>And, of course, you have to rely on comments to explain that you know
  about the default and are failing to define these functions <i>on
  purpose.</i> I&rsquo;m always a little uncomfortable with relying on
  documentation for things like that.</p>

  <h3>Virtual assignment</h3>

  <p>Finally, several people, including my own manager here at IBM, disputed my
  advice to make the assignment operator of a class non-virtual. Let&rsquo;s
  take a closer look at this issue.</p>

  <p>Consider the following simple example:</p>
  <pre>
X* x;

void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    x = &amp;newX;
}
</pre>

  <p>This will work right, but only if <tt>X</tt> is a monomorphic class. But
  let&rsquo;s say <tt>X</tt> is polymorphic. Pretend it has an inheritance
  hierarchy like this:</p>
  <pre>
  X
 / \
Y   Z
</pre>

  <p>That is&hellip;</p>
  <pre>
class X {
    // ...
}

class Y : public X {
   // ...
}

class Z : public X {
    // ...
}
</pre>

  <p>Now, if either <tt>x</tt> or <tt>newX</tt> points to an object of class
  <tt>Y</tt> or <tt>Z</tt>, we&rsquo;ll slice. Only the members defined in
  <tt>X</tt> will get copied. If <tt>x</tt> is an instance of <tt>Y</tt> or
  <tt>Z</tt>, the members defined by <tt>Y</tt> or <tt>Z</tt> won&rsquo;t get
  led in with new values. If <tt>newX</tt> is an instance of <tt>Y</tt> or
  <tt>Z</tt>, the members defined by <tt>Y</tt> or <tt>Z</tt> won&rsquo;t get
  copied into <tt>x</tt>. Bad news.</p>

  <p>The problem here, of course, is that we&rsquo;re calling
  <tt>X</tt>&rsquo;s assignment operator even when <tt>x</tt> isn&rsquo;t an
  instance of <tt>X</tt>. The obvious solution, therefore, would be to make
  <tt>X</tt>&rsquo;s assignment operator virtual. Then the correct assignment
  operator would be called. If we do this, the assignment operators would look
  like this:</p>
  <pre>
X&amp; X::operator=(const X&amp; that) {
    // copy X&rsquo;s members...
    return *this;
}

X&amp; Y::operator=(const X&amp; that) {
    Y&amp; y = dynamic_cast&lt;Y&amp;&gt;(that);

    X::operator=(that);
    // copy Y&rsquo;s members using y
    return *this;
}

X&amp; Z::operator=(const X&amp; that) {
    Z&amp; z = dynamic_cast&lt;Z&amp;&gt;(that);

    X::operator=(that);
    // copy Z&rsquo;s members using z
    return *this;
}
</pre>

  <p>Now, if <tt>x</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> are actually both instances of
  <tt>Y</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>&rsquo;s assignment operator will get called and
  everybody will work right. Big improvement, right?</p>

  <p>Well, consider the situation where <tt>x</tt> is a <tt>Y</tt> and
  <tt>newX</tt> is a <tt>Z</tt>. In this case, the <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> will
  fail, throwing a <tt>bad_cast</tt> exception. Now we have a problem.</p>

  <p>The <tt>bad_cast</tt> exception is good, in a way, because it traps the
  mismatched classes and causes an error, rather than just slicing silently.
  But now we have an error condition we have to handle.</p>

  <p>Remember that after an assignment succeeds, the objects on either side of
  the <tt>=</tt> are to be computationally equivalent. That is, all of their
  visible state and their behavior should be the same. This implies that they
  should be the same class. What you really want is for it to look like
  <tt>x</tt> morphed from whatever class it was to the same class <tt>newX</tt>
  is. <tt>X</tt>, <tt>Y</tt>, and <tt>Z</tt>&rsquo;s assignment operators
  can&rsquo;t do this; there&rsquo;s no way to morph an existing object from
  one class to another (well, there kind of is, but we&rsquo;ll get to it
  later). Instead, <tt>setX()</tt> has to deal with this:</p>
  <pre>
void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    try {
        x = &amp;newX;
    }
    catch (bad_cast&amp;) {
        X* temp = newX.clone();
        delete x;
        x = temp;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>Remember <tt>clone()</tt>? This is the polymorphic copy constructor. If
  you need polymorphic copy on a group of related classes, you define a virtual
  function called <tt>clone()</tt> and every class in the tree overrides it to
  call his own copy constructor. You can&rsquo;t just call <tt>X</tt>&rsquo;s
  copy constructor for the same reason you can&rsquo;t just call
  <tt>X</tt>&rsquo;s assignment operator.</p>

  <p>Another alternative is that <tt>setX()</tt> doesn&rsquo;t handle this
  condition, but some other class up the inheritance chain will have to,
  probably by doing the same thing we&rsquo;re doing here: deleting the old
  <tt>X</tt> and creating a new one of the right class. (There might be other
  meaningful ways of handling the exception, but they&rsquo;d be more
  application-specific.)</p>

  <p>The other possibility is that <i>nobody</i> handles the exception. We
  could just declare "assignment operators shall always be called with like
  classes on either side of the equal sign" as a program invariant. In other
  words, we declare heterogeneous assignment to be a condition which Should
  Never Happen.</p>

  <p>Violations of program invariants ("Should Never Happen" conditions) are
  programmer errors; they&rsquo;re things you&rsquo;re assuming you&rsquo;ll
  never run into at runtime. An exception shouldn&rsquo;t be thrown for a
  violated invariant; since you&rsquo;re not expecting it to happen at runtime,
  you don&rsquo;t want to waste time putting in lots of extra code to handle
  it; the program is just malformed. And if you throw an exception that nobody
  catches, this simply causes your program to terminate. Quietly. With no error
  messages.</p>

  <p>If your program&rsquo;s going to terminate, you want it to terminate
  loudly, proclaiming to the world that Something Went Wrong. The way you do
  this is with the <tt>assert()</tt> macro. You pass to <tt>assert()</tt> an
  expression you expect to always evaluate to <tt>true</tt>. If it evaluates to
  <tt>false</tt>, it prints an error message that usually contains the text of
  the offending expression and the line number of the assert, and then the
  program terminates. (You can also cause asserts to be compiled out in
  production versions of your program, which will cause them to fail silently
  instead.)</p>

  <p>So then instead of the dynamic cast, you can do a static cast and precede
  it with an assert:</p>
  <pre>
X&amp; Y::operator=(const X&amp; that) {
    assert(typeid(that) == typeid(*this));

    Y&amp; y = static_cast&lt;Y&amp;&gt;(that);
    X::operator=(that);
    // copy Y&rsquo;s members using y
    return *this;
}
</pre>

  <p>By the way, my original attempt at this was</p>
  <pre>
assert(typeid(that) == typeid(Y));
</pre>

  <p>You don&rsquo;t want to do it this way, because then when
  <tt>Y::operator=()</tt> calls <tt>X::operator=()</tt>,
  <tt>X::operator=()</tt> will choke because <tt>that</tt> isn&rsquo;t an
  instance of <tt>X</tt>. You&rsquo;re not concerned that "that" is some
  particular static type; you&rsquo;re concerned that "this" and "that" are the
  <i>same</i> type, whatever that type is.</p>

  <p>So anyway, using the assert is one way around the heterogeneous-assignment
  problem, and it has a lot to recommend it, in situations where you really
  know that this invariant can hold.</p>

  <p>But let&rsquo;s go back to the previous answer for a minute and assume
  we&rsquo;re going to catch the exception and finagle the assignment in
  <tt>setX()</tt>. To refresh our memory, <tt>setX()</tt> now looks like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    try {
        x = &amp;newX;
    }
    catch (bad_cast&amp;) {
        X* temp = newX.clone();
        delete x;
        x = temp;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s consider our possibilities here, ignoring <tt>Z</tt> for a
  moment. If <tt>x</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> are both instances of <tt>X</tt> or
  both instances of <tt>Y</tt>, we&rsquo;re cool. If <tt>x</tt> is an instance
  of <tt>Y</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> is an instance of <tt>X</tt>, we&rsquo;re
  also cool. <tt>Y::operator=()</tt> with throw a <tt>bad_cast</tt> exception,
  and we&rsquo;ll catch it, delete <tt>x</tt>, and new up a fresh new
  <tt>Y</tt> to assign to <tt>x</tt>.</p>

  <p>But what if <tt>x</tt> is an instance of <tt>X</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> is
  an instance of <tt>Y</tt>? In this case, we&rsquo;ll end up in
  <tt>X</tt>&rsquo;s assignment operator, and the dynamic cast will
  <i>succeed.</i> <tt>Y</tt> is a subclass of <tt>X</tt>, so dynamically
  casting a reference to a <tt>Y</tt> to a reference to an <tt>X</tt> is legal.
  Every <tt>Y</tt> is also an <tt>X</tt>. But because we&rsquo;re in X&rsquo;s
  assignment operator, we&rsquo;ll only copy over the members of <tt>newX</tt>
  that were defined in <tt>X</tt>. It&rsquo;s our old friend slicing again.</p>

  <p>What we&rsquo;d have to do to avoid this is manually check for like class
  in each assignment operator and throw the <tt>bad_cast</tt> ourselves, rather
  than relying on <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> to do it for us.</p>

  <p>Instead, my original solution to this problem was to avoid using the
  assignment operator in the first place:</p>
  <pre>
void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    X* temp = newX.clone();
    delete x;
    x = temp;
}
</pre>

  <p>I still like this. It&rsquo;s simple and clear, and it works correctly
  with no extra hassles even when <tt>x</tt> and <tt>newX</tt> are instances of
  different classes. The other solution, with the try/catch blocks, has an
  advantage in situations where the cost of deleting and newing the destination
  object is large and relatively rare (the try costs nothing in most modern
  compilers, so you in effect fast-path the case of like classes, but an actual
  throw can be quite expensive, so you achieve this fast-path effect at the
  expense of the different-classes case).</p>

  <p>If the fast-path option makes sense for your application, I&rsquo;d
  suggest avoiding the exception and doing it yourself like this:</p>
  <pre>
void setX(const X&amp; newX) {
    if (typeid(*x) == typeid(newX))
        x = newX;
    else {
        X* temp = newX.clone();
        delete x;
        x = temp;
    }
}
</pre>

  <p>Now if you avoid using the assignment operator in situations where slicing
  may be a problem, we&rsquo;re still left with the question of whether it
  makes more sense to make the assignment operator virtual or non-virtual.
  I&rsquo;m tending now to come down on the side of making the assignment
  operator virtual with an assert to check for the different-classes condition
  (since there&rsquo;s no way to handle that in the assignment operator itself
  and therefore the calling function already has to be aware of the possibility
  of polymorphism and handle it).</p>

  <p>However, there&rsquo;s another problem here. I remembered Taligent&rsquo;s
  coding guidelines discouraging virtual assignment operators, so I went back
  to see why it recommended that. I wish I had done that before. It turns out
  Taligent&rsquo;s guidelines weren&rsquo;t hard and fast on the subject.
  Instead they point out that defining</p>
  <pre>
virtual X&amp; Y::operator=(const X&amp; that);
</pre>

  <p>won&rsquo;t keep the compiler from defining</p>
  <pre>
Y&amp; Y::operator=(const Y&amp; that);
</pre>

  <p>In other words, an override of an inherited assignment operator
  doesn&rsquo;t suppress the compiler-generated default assignment operator.
  You&rsquo;d still have to do that manually by declaring it private and not
  giving it an implementation.</p>

  <p>And actually, this won&rsquo;t even work because C++&rsquo;s overload
  resolution rules will cause the suppressed version to win in some types of
  call. For instance, consider a class like this:</p>
  <pre>
class Y : public X {
    public:
        virtual X&amp; operator=(const X&amp; that);
        // other method definitions&hellip;
    private:
        Y&amp; operator=(const Y&amp; that);
}
</pre>

  <p>Now consider this code snippet:</p>
  <pre>
Y someY(/*agruments*/);
// do something with someY
Y someOtherY(/*arguments*/);
someY = someOtherY;
</pre>

  <p>Since both <tt>someY</tt> and <tt>someOtherY</tt> are instances of
  <tt>Y</tt>, the overload resolution rules will declare the nonvirtual version
  of <tt>operator=()</tt> to be the "winner," instead of the inherited virtual
  <tt>operator=()</tt>. Since the nonvirtual <tt>operator=()</tt> is private,
  you&rsquo;ll get an access-violation error at compile time.</p>

  <p>Instead, you&rsquo;d have to define the default assignment operator to
  call the virtual one. In every class that inherits the virtual one. Of
  course, this means defining it non-virtual. To see why, imagine if <tt>Y</tt>
  in the above example had a subclass called <tt>Z</tt>. If <tt>Y</tt>&rsquo;s
  <tt>operator=()</tt> was virtual, <tt>Z</tt> would have to override it, then
  it would have to override <tt>X</tt>&rsquo;s <tt>operator=()</tt>, and then
  it would have to replace its own default assignment operator. Cutting any
  corners here risks creating situations where the "winning" function,
  according to the overload-resolution rules, is a function that is not
  accessible or isn&rsquo;t implemented. Clearly, this gets ridiculous quickly
  as the inheritance hierarchy gets deeper.</p>

  <p>One side effect in either case is that you have to define an override of
  the virtual <tt>operator=()</tt> even when you don&rsquo;t strictly need one;
  otherwise, the "default" one will hide the virtual one.</p>

  <p>So there you go. A truly foolproof method of handling polymorphism in
  assignment operators involves declaring <i>both</i> a virtual <i>and</i> a
  non-virtual assignment operator in every class (except the root class of each
  inheritance hierarchy), with the non-virtual calling the virtual and the
  virtual asserting that both objects involved are the same class. Any time a
  calling function couldn&rsquo;t guarantee the invariant would hold, it would
  have to avoid using the assignment operator and manually delete the object
  referenced by the target variable and new up a new one of the proper
  type.</p>

  <p>Beautiful, huh?</p>

  <h3>Other ways of morphing</h3>

  <p>Before I wrap this up, one more thing: I alluded earlier to the idea that
  there are ways of making an object look like it&rsquo;s morphed from one
  class to another. There are two ways to do this, neither of which is really
  all that much of a winner.</p>

  <p>One option is <i>not</i> to change the class of the object on the
  left-hand side. It&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to define assignment
  operators that take different types on the left and right-hand side. The
  operator in this case performs some kind of meaningful conversion of the
  incoming data as part of the assignment process. The result isn&rsquo;t
  really a copy, but it may produce completely appropriate results. This
  solution is definitely the right way to go for some classes in some
  applications, but it&rsquo;s not a general solution. Be sure to consider
  whether it&rsquo;s appropriate for your classes before going to all the
  trouble above.</p>

  <p>The other option is to fake inheritance using containment. In this case,
  the objects on the left and right-hand sides of the equal sign <i>are</i> the
  same class, but they behave like members of different classes because they
  own objects of different classes. The simplest version of this idea is a
  smart pointer that knows about polymorphism for a certain group of classes
  and does the right thing. All you&rsquo;re really doing here is encapsulating
  in this object&rsquo;s assignment operator the delete/new code you&rsquo;d
  otherwise have to put in client code, but hiding junk like this in a
  smart-pointer class is very often a useful and effective way to go. (This is
  the essence of the State pattern, by the way.)</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but there&rsquo;s something really scary to
  me about a language where copying state from one object to another is this
  complicated. By now, I suspect at least a dozen or two programmers have
  contributed something new to this discussion. If it takes this many
  programmers to write a simple assignment operator, think how complicated
  writing code that actually does something meaningful must be!</p>

  <p>The devil truly is in the details, especially in C++ programming.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;m sure there are still other issues, both with the original
  article and this one, that I&rsquo;ve missed. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about
  this, and I&rsquo;m interested in continuing to lean. Keep those cards and
  letters coming!</p>
