      An office is generally a room or other area in which people work, but may 
		also denote a position within an organization with specific duties 
		attached to it (see officer, office-holder, official); the latter is in 
		fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the 
		location of one&#39;s duty. When used as an adjective, the term office may 
		refer to business-related tasks. In legal writing, a company or 
		organization has offices in any place that it has an official presence, 
		even if that presence consists of, for example, a storage silo rather 
		than an office.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>An office is an architectural and design phenomenon and a social 
		phenomenon, whether it is a tiny office such as a bench in the corner of 
		a &quot;Mom and Pop shop&quot; of extremely small size (see small office/home 
		office) through entire floors of buildings up to and including massive 
		buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms an office 
		usually refers to the location where white-collar workers are employed.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span><strong>History of offices</strong><span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>The word stems from the Latin officium, as its equivalents in 
		various mainly romance languages. Interestingly, this was not 
		necessarily a place, but rather an often mobile &#39;bureau&#39; in the sense of 
		a human staff or even the abstract notion of a formal position, such as 
		a magistrature. The relatively elaborate Roman bureaucracy would not be 
		equaled for centuries in the West after the fall of Rome, even partially 
		reverting to illiteracy, while the East preserved a more sophisticated 
		administrative culture, both under Byzantium and under Islam.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>Office buildings found in the crowded streets of Bangkok, 
		Thailand.Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace 
		complex or a large temple. There was usually a room where scrolls were 
		kept and scribes did their work. Ancient texts mentioning the work of 
		scribes allude to the existence of such &quot;offices&quot;. These rooms are 
		sometimes called &quot;libraries&quot; by some archaeologists and the general 
		press because one often associates scrolls with literature. In fact they 
		were true offices since the scrolls were meant for record keeping and 
		other management functions such as treaties and edicts, and not for 
		writing or keeping poetry or other works of fiction.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>The medieval chancery was usually the place where most government 
		letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of 
		a kingdom. The rooms of the chancery often had walls full of 
		pigeonholes, constructed to hold rolled up pieces of parchment for 
		safekeeping or ready reference, a precursor to the book shelf. The 
		introduction of printing during the Renaissance did not change these 
		early government offices much.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>Pre-industrial illustrations such as paintings or tapestries 
		often show us personalities or eponyms in their private offices, 
		handling record keeping books or writing on scrolls of parchment. All 
		kinds of writings seemed to be mixed in these early forms of offices. 
		Before the invention of the printing press and its distribution there 
		was often a very thin line between a private office and a private 
		library since books were read or written in the same space at the same 
		desk or table, and general accounting and personal or private letters 
		were also done there.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span><strong>Office structure</strong><span class="style1"><strong><br>
		</strong></span>There are many different ways of arranging the space in 
		an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial 
		fashions and the culture of specific companies can be even more 
		important. Choices include, how many people will work within the same 
		room. At one extreme, each individual worker will have their own room; 
		at the other extreme a large open plan office can be made up of one main 
		room with tens or hundreds of people working in the same space. Open 
		plan offices put multiple workers together in the same space, and some 
		studies have shown that they can improve short term productivity, i.e. 
		within a single software project. At the same time, the loss of privacy 
		and security can increase the incidence of theft and loss of company 
		secrets. A type of compromise between open plan and individual rooms is 
		provided by the cubicle, possibly made most famous by the Dilbert 
		cartoon series, which solves visual privacy to some extent, but often 
		fails on acoustic separation and security. Most cubicles also require 
		the occupant to sit with their back towards anyone who might be 
		approaching; workers in walled offices almost always try to position 
		their normal work seats and desks so that they can see someone entering, 
		and in some instances, install tiny mirrors on things such as computer 
		monitors.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span><strong>Office buildings</strong><span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>A small office building in Salinas, California, United 
		States.While offices can be built in almost any location in almost any 
		building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult. 
		These requirements can be both legal (i.e. light levels must be 
		sufficient) or technical (i.e. requirements for computer networking). 
		Alongside such other requirements such as security and flexibility of 
		layout, this has led to the creation of special buildings which are 
		dedicated only or primarily for use as offices. An office building, also 
		known as an office block, is a form of commercial building which 
		contains spaces mainly designed to be used for offices.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>The primary purpose of an office building is to provide a 
		workplace and working environment primarily for administrative and 
		managerial workers. These workers usually occupy set areas within the 
		office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other 
		equipment they may need within these areas.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>An office building will be divided into sections for different 
		companies or may be dedicated to one company. In either case, each 
		company will typically have a reception area, one or several meeting 
		rooms, singular or open-plan offices, as well as toilets.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>Many office buildings also have kitchen facilities and a staff 
		room, where workers can have lunch or take a short break.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>Office and retail rental rates<span class="style1"><br>
		</span>Rental rates for office and retail space are typically quoted in 
		terms of money per floor-area–time, usually money per floor-area–year. 
		For example, the rate for a particular property may be 290 dollars per 
		square-meter–year ($290/m2·a) (or $29/ft2·a), and rates in the area 
		could range $200/m2·a–$500/m2·a.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>In many countries, rent is typically paid monthly even if usually 
		discussed in terms of years.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>Example: A particular 200 m2 space is priced at $150/m2·a: (200 
		m2) × ($150/m2·a) / (12 mo/a) = $2500/month<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>In a gross lease, the rate quoted is an all-inclusive rate. One 
		pays a set amount of rent per time and the landlord is responsible for 
		all other expenses such as costs of utilities, taxes, insurance, 
		maintenance, and repairs.<span class="style1"><br>
		<br>
		</span>The triple net lease is one in which the tenant is liable for a 
		share of various expenses such as property taxes, insurance, 
		maintenance, utilities, climate control, repairs, janitorial services 
		and landscaping.<span class="style1"><br>

		</strong></span>The examples and perspective in this article deal 
		primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view

		<br>
		</span>The Building Owners and Managers Association International (BOMA) 
		classifies office space into three categories: Class A, Class B, and 
		Class C. According to BOMA, Class A office buildings (NL, ZH) have the 
		&quot;most prestigious buildings competing for premier office users with 
		rents above average for the area.&quot; BOMA states that Class A facilities 
		have &quot;high quality standard finishes, state of the art systems, 
		exceptional accessibility and a definite market presence.&quot; BOMA 
		describes Class B office buildings as those that compete &quot;for a wide 
		range of users with rents in the average range for the area.&quot; BOMA 
		states that Class B buildings have &quot;adequate systems&quot; and finishes that 
		&quot;are fair to good for the area,&quot; but that the buildings do not compete 
		with Class A buildings for the same prices. According to BOMA Class C 
		buildings are aimed towards &quot;tenants requiring functional space at rents 
		below the average for the area.&quot;<span class="style1"><br>
