On 27 May 2009, Williams made his debut as a professional boxer and defeated Garry Gurr with a Technical knockout&nbsp;(TKO) in the second round in Sydney. On 30 June 2010, he defeated Ryan Hogan in a bout that ended by way of TKO after only two minutes and 35 seconds. Williams described the preparation for the fight as "good off-season training" for his imminent debut for the Canterbury rugby team.<br />
