<I>It has been particularly difficult to sort out the great deal of conflicting information regarding these Foster families.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
<B>Richard Foster</B> arrived in America when he was just sixteen years old.
Michael Motes states that Richard immigrated to Virginia in the ship <I>Safety</I>, which sailed on August 10, 1635. Richard settled first in Elizabeth Cittie [City] County, Virginia, where he married Sussan Garnett circa 1642. Sussan Garnett was born circa 1622 in Elizabeth City County, Virginia and died after 1660 in Gloucester County, Virginia. On November 26, 1653 Richard was granted 250 acres of land in Lynhaven Parish in Lower Norfolk County, Virginia. In 1655 he moved to Gloucester County, Virginia, where he received a grant of 200 acres for the transportation of four persons. More details on his life are to be found in <I>Forster Foster and Their Royal Descendants</I> from which the above information was taken. <A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote1anc" HREF="#sdendnote1sym">(1)</A>
Information on Richard Foster is controversial.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
Researcher B. G. Foster provided interesting reading on Richard Foster: <A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote2anc" HREF="#sdendnote2sym">(2)</A></P>

&ldquo;In 1989 I published a book <I>The Foster Family of Flanders, England,
and America</I> &ndash; all copies have long been sold &ndash; only a few remain for my grandchildren. However, I have kept and added to the genealogical portion of the Foster family. At the last count I had identified over 31,000 individuals directly kin or kin through marriage to the original Robert and Elizabeth Garnett Foster family. The name of our Foster immigrant came to me very early in my search &ndash; his name, Richard Foster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
&ldquo;This Richard Foster came to American in 1635 on the ship <I>Safety</I>. He was the son of Sir Robert Foster and a wife identified as Miss Isham, daughter of John Isham. This information was given to me originally
from Richard Foster of Alexandria, Virginia, a distant cousin whose wife was also a Foster. He had hired a professional genealogist from Atlanta, Georgia to help his wife obtain membership into the Colonial Dames. This genealogist, Mrs. Julian Lane, came up with this Richard Foster as her Foster Immigrant &ndash; then, of course, as ours.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
&ldquo;For a number of years I did not question nor ask for documentation of the status of Richard Foster as my immigrant. Many years ago I became
acquainted with Captain Ed Dittmer, whose wife was a Foster descendant. Ed was in Navel Intelligence stationed at the pentagon and on several occasions had reasons to be in San Antonio. On two of these trips he gave me a call and came over to College Station for a visit. Ed was doing Foster, Garnett, and Golding research in the original colonial county records. It was he who we give credit for identifying the children of <B>Robert and Elizabeth Garnett Foster</B> of Gloucester and Essex Counties in Virginia. It was he who first
made me stop and evaluate the records where Richard and his wife, Sussan Garnett, lived. I began to look for information that would substantiate Richard Foster&rsquo;s status as the immigrant of the large and important southern Foster family. The more I examined the records the more confused I became.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
&ldquo;After reviewing extensively the records of Lower Norfolk County, Virginia from early 1600 to the 1700s looking for proof of our Foster immigrant, I am still not certain who he is. . . . Let us exam just what has been documented on Richard Foster, Immigrant. We know that he came to the Virginia Colonies in 1635 aboard the ship, <I>Safety</I> and on the same ship was his <B>stepfather</B>, Bartholomew Hoskins. Bartholomew had married his [Richard&rsquo;s] mother, Mrs. Dorcas Foster on July 3, 1624 in St. Dunstan&rsquo;s Church, in Tepney, London, England. The records show that she was a &ldquo;widow with several children.&rdquo; One of his siblings was a sister, Ann with a brother Robert as a possibility.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
&ldquo;We know that in Lower Norfolk County, Virginia there were at least three Richard Fosters in the same time span. One of these Richard Fosters
was an attorney and would marry Dorcas Hoskins, daughter of Bartholomew and Mrs. Dorcas Foster Hoskins. It is this Richard Foster who was a member of the House of Burgess for Lower Norfolk County. It was this Richard Foster that was called Lieutenant, Captain and then Major. It was this Richard Foster who would move with his father-in-law, Bartholomew Hoskins, and brother-in-law, Richard Hoskins, to Albermarle, North Carolina. Consequently one Richard
Foster was a son-in-law to Bartholomew Hoskins and another was a stepson. No wonder there was confusion. Both of these Richard Foster were literate. There is at least one other who was illiterate and used the (W) as his signature. One of the three Richard Fosters would marry Ann Jackson on November 16, 1640 and father a child conceived out of wedlock. It is difficult to tell which one of the Richards did the dirty deed. Regardless it has but little bearing on the identification of the true immigrant. These are just a few of the
essential documented facts concerning the three Richard Fosters of Lower Norfolk County, Virginia.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
&ldquo;There are numerous citings of the marriage of <B>Richard Foster to Sussan Garnett</B>, daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth Garnett. I have found
no documentation of this marriage nor has anyone else that I have been able to contact. This does not mean it did not happen it just means that we cannot prove or disprove it. We do know that her name was not Susanna, Susannah, or Susanna (Ann) as has been reported. Some have tried to make Ann and Sussan the same person by naming her Sussanah and calling her Ann. If you read the original muster roll taken after the great Indian massacre it is spelled, Sussan. Her name was probably Susanna but the roll taker spelled it phonetically, thus Sussan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
&ldquo;The marriage date of Richard and Sussan has been reported to be in 1641 give or take a few years. As in most cases we could expect their first child in 1642 or 1643 and then a child thereafter every two years. However, it has been documented that this Richard Foster went to England in 1649 for a five-year period. He returned in 1654. Did he take his wife and family with him to England?

Richard Foster, born 1643 (undocumented). According to one researcher, there is some information on a Richard Foster: <A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote3anc" HREF="#sdendnote3sym">(3)</A> Richard Foster, born 1710 in Surrey County, Virginia and died February 1795 in Surrey County. In 1743 in Virginia he married Susannah Rand, born about 1723 and died November 26, 1794 in Virginia. They had four children: Judith Foster who married James
Clark; Ransom Foster, born about 1750 who married Elizabeth Coman; Peter G. Foster, born March 22, 1756 and was married to Ann Hall; Richard Foster, married to Elizabeth J. Hall. Richard, born 1710 was the son of Richard Foster, Jr. born 1643 and died 1715 in Abbington Parrish, Gloucester County, Virginia. This Richard was the son of Richard Forster, born 1619 in County Durham, England and Susannah &ldquo;Anna&rdquo; Garnett, born 1620. Richard Foster, born 1752 and son of William Foster and Ann Booker, was born in Amelia County, Virginia and died June 2, 1775 in Prince Edward County, Virginia. He was married to Judith Walker. Their child was Francis Foster (male or female).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Another researcher gives this information. <A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote4anc" HREF="#sdendnote4sym">(4)</A> Peter Ransome Foster is the son of Ransom Foster and Elizabeth Coman. Ransom was born about 1752, probably in Virginia, and died about 1804 in Brunswick County, Virginia. His will was made in November 1803 and proved October 1804. On September 5, 1772 he married Elizabeth Coman in York County, Virginia. She was born about 1754 and died about 1813 in Brunswick County. Together they had seven children: John Harwood (April 24, 1773 - September 28, 1850, married Sela Lightfoot and
Sarah Braswell); William (October 27, 1776 - May 2, 1826, married Fannie Lucinda Ballew); Peter Ransome (1778 - ?, married Sara James); Susannah R. (circa 1780 - before 1840; married Richard Moore); Elizabeth H. (circa 1780 - circa 1857, married George Williams); Beverly (September 25, 1785 - May 1, 1873, married Nancy Ragsdale); and Samuel (June 1787 - September 1855, married Nancy James). John and William stayed in Virginia. Peter and Samuel moved to Tennessee, Beverly and Elizabeth moved to Missouri. Ransom&rsquo;s parents were Richard Foster (circa 1725 - December 1794, Surry County, Virginia) and Susannah. It seems to be accepted that she was Susannah Rand, but no one has been able to prove this. She was probably a Ransom since
this name is used for many generations and Rand is never used. So far, there is no proof for either version. Richard and Susannah had three children mentioned in Richard&rsquo;s will: Ransom, Peter, and an unnamed daughter who had died and left a daughter named Susannah Clark. Other researchers have this family as descended from Richard and Sussan Foster&rsquo;s son, John, not Richard.</P>

Robert Foster married Elizabeth in the early 1680s in Gloucester County,
Virginia (other researchers have Robert married to a Sarah Biggs first, circa 1671, and Elizabeth circa 1686). The preponderance of evidence is that Elizabeth was a Garnett, whose father or brother was John Garnett (see Garnett family history). The Garnetts and Fosters were close neighbors living in Gloucester County. In 1692 Robert Foster, his brother John Foster, and Robert&rsquo;s brother-in-law John Garnett, along with several other families bought adjacent land in Essex County, Virginia near the Rappahannock River. This is where, in St. Ann&rsquo;s Parish on Gilson&rsquo;s Run (presently called Mount Landing Creek), Robert and Elizabeth lived and raised their
family of eleven children.</P>

According to Michael Motes, after her husband Robert died, his widow Elizabeth married Robert Charlesworth. They were found in several legal records in Essex County after their marriage. Elizabeth appeared in an Essex
County, Virginia court on March 17, 1718/19 when her son James sold his land to William Taylor and she relinquished her right of dower to the 75 acres, which had been bequeathed to James Foster in Robert&rsquo;s 1716 will. Although Elizabeth had witnessed the original deed from her son, James to William Taylor three months earlier, she was still required to relinquish her dower right to the land. This deed was dated December 12, 1718. They were living in the part of Essex County that became Caroline County, so several records of transactions were found in Caroline County up to 1736. On February 13, 1719, Robert Charlesworth bought 150 acres of land on Gilson Run, Essex County, from his step-grandson, John Foster Jr. for which he paid John Jr.
400 pounds of tobacco. They then sold the land on May 7, 1720 to James Garnett of King and Queen County for 5 pounds 5 shillings, before they moved to King William (now Caroline) County, Virginia in 1721. On Nov 14, 1735 [Caroline County?] it was ordered that Charlesworth be free from paying county levy. He may have been exempt due to his age and probably died shortly after. By 1742 she moved to Amelia County, Virginia, to join some of her Foster children there. Elizabeth died along Stock Creek in Amelia County where she is probably buried.</P>

I am pretty sure that this particular Elizabeth Garnett who married
Robert Foster was the daughter of a man named Thomas Garnett. According to the information I have, Elizabeth was born in about 1660 at Gloucester County, Virginia. Because there were several different Thomas Garnetts living around Virginia at that time frame, no one has yet satisfactorily proven which of these various Thomas Garnetts was Elizabeth&rsquo;s father. In any case, Robert Foster was apparently also related to the Garnett family since his mother is believed to have been Sussan [or Susannah] Garnett. But again, the predecessors of Robert Foster are also rather uncertain and unproven. Robert Foster was married first to a wife named Sarah Biggs. He married
second to Elizabeth Garnett in about 1681 or 1682.</P>

According to the information that I have in my files, Elizabeth Garnett was
born in 1660 (not 1663) and she died in 1716 (not 1744). Elizabeth Garnett married Robert Foster in 1682 (not 1684). Robert Foster was born in 1651 at Essex, Virginia (not Gloucester) and he died in Essex County during the year proceeding his wife&rsquo;s death in 1716.</P>

Robert Foster was the son of Richard Foster (born 1619 in Durham, England
and died about 1681 in Gloucester County, Virginia). His mother was Sussan Garnett, daughter of Thomas Garnett who had arrived in the early Jamestown colony of Virginia on the good ship <I>Swan</I> in 1610. Sussan Garnett was born at Elizabeth City, Virginia in about 1620 and she lived until about 1660. Sussan Garnett and Richard Foster married at Elizabeth City in the year 1642. They had six sons: Richard Foster, born 1643; James Foster, born 1645; William Foster, born 1647; <B>Robert Foster</B>, born 1651; Thomas Foster, born 1656; and John Foster, born 1660. It is possible, I think, that Sussan [nee Garnett] Foster actually died during childbirth or as a result of
complications following the birth of her last son John Foster in 1660 when Robert was just eleven years old.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
It is quite likely that the Elizabeth Garnett who married Robert Foster was actually related in some way to Robert Foster&rsquo;s mother, Sussan Garnett. My guess (still to be proven) is that Elizabeth was the daughter of Sussan Garnett&rsquo;s brother Thomas Garnett and was therefore the niece of Robert Foster&rsquo;s mother.</P>

The basic question . . . concerns the variance in the death dates reported for Elizabeth (Garnett) Foster, wife of Robert Foster that I have in my files compared to the research contained in a controversial book written by Dr. Billy Glen Foster, <I>The Foster Family of Flanders, England, and America</I>, as well as the research done by Marilyn herself. To clarify the discrepancy that&rsquo;s at issue here. My own Garnett database indicates that Elizabeth (Garnett) Foster (daughter of Thomas Garnett) who was the wife of Robert Foster, died in 1716 the same year as her husband Robert Foster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
On the other hand, according to Marilyn Lewis&rsquo; research, Elizabeth
Foster continued to live on after her husband&rsquo;s death in 1716. Marilyn believes that Elizabeth Foster remarried to Robert Charlesworth in about 1718 and died subsequently in about 1741. There appears to be a great deal of evidence to support Marilyn&rsquo;s conclusion that Elizabeth lived many years after 1716. For example, Marilyn&rsquo;s research provides the following points to substantiate this theory:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
(1) On June 22, 1722 Robert Charlesworth received two different land patents - one a Royal land patent for 425 acres in St. John Parish, King William County, Virginia and one a joint patent with Joseph Fulcher for 400 acres in St. John Parish, King William County.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
(2) Court records (cited by Dr. Billie Foster) show that Robert Charlesworth and Elizabeth along with Elizabeth&rsquo;s dau. Barbara Foster Loving (and family) and Elizabeth&rsquo;s sons Thomas and William, and probably Margaret and Elizabeth, Jr. moved to the above mentioned land shortly after the grants were patented. 
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
(3) Elizabeth Foster Charlesworth appeared in an Essex County, Virginia
court on March 17, 1718/19 when her son James sold his land to William Taylor and she then relinquished her right of dower to the 75 acres, which had been bequeathed to James Foster in the will of his father Robert Foster in 1716. This deed was dated Dec. 12, 1718.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
(4) In 1739 Thomas, son of Robert and Elizabeth Foster, sold to Richard and Barbara Loving (his sister) 150 acres of the 350 he patented in 1737. Thomas&rsquo;s mother, Elizabeth (Garnett/Foster) and her husband Robert Charlesworth were also there and built a home adjacent to Thomas&rsquo; land.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
(5) In 1741, Thomas Foster gave a gift of land to his mother, &ldquo;for
reason of the dutiful regard he hath for his mother, the said Elizabeth Charlesworth,&rdquo; Thomas Foster deeded &ldquo;one part of land (50 acres) . . . it being the land on which the said Robert Charlesworth now liveth.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
(6) Dr. Billie Glen Foster says that Robert Charlesworth died in Amelia
before June 22, 1745 when administration of his estate was awarded to Edward Booker. Elizabeth probably predeceased her second husband, Robert Charlesworth, and died at some time between 1742 and 1745.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
In the face of all this evidence supporting the added longevity of Elizabeth (Garnett) Foster beyond 1716, I retreated quickly to check my Garnett database hoping to determine if there were any citations or sources contained there for the apparently erroneous 1716 death date for Elizabeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
I could not find any definitive source for this 1716 death date - although the same year appears correctly for her husband Robert Foster. I can only conclude that I probably found this death date recorded somewhere in one of the many Foster family genealogies that I came across during the course of investigating the links between the Garnett and Foster families of Virginia. Or, perhaps, I made a simple error in transcribing Robert Foster&rsquo;s death date incorrectly into the database file for his wife as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-right: 1.0in; margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
My conclusion now is that there is sufficient evidence from Marilyn&rsquo;s
research to suppose that Elizabeth (Garnett) Foster did survive beyond 1716, remarried and continued to live with her second husband, Robert Charlesworth for another few decades. - Doug Garnett<BR></P>

Robert Foster was born circa 1677-1685 in Gloucester County, Virginia and
died circa 1720 in Essex County, Virginia, age 43. Robert Foster, Jr., born in Gloucester County, moved with his parents to Essex County when he was young. There he married Ann Lloyd, daughter of George and Joanna Lloyd, in 1719 (other researchers state 1706). She was born circa 1682 and possibly died after 1785. After the death of his father, Robert, Jr. inherited the plantation and land on which his parents had lived. It is likely that he lived with his parents and then with his widowed mother until her marriage to Robert Charlesworth in circa 1718. He then took over the plantation and

James Foster (Robert<SUP><I>1</I></SUP>) was born circa 1679-1687 in Gloucester County, Virginia and
died circa 1749 in Amelia County, Virginia, at age 70. James Foster had always been assumed to be the second child with his estimated birth date being 1686 in Gloucester County. In Robert Foster Sr.&rsquo;s will he left James and his brother John two parcels of land one containing 75 acres and the other 125 acres with James to have his choice. James chose the smaller parcel, possibly because it may have contained the original plantation home and out buildings. When Robert, Jr. died, James, the next oldest, should have been the heir at law of the inheritance. However, John, the younger brother, became heir at law. Perhaps James had died (which would explain the scarcity
of records for James) or John was the second child and that James was the third. Regardless, James sold his inheritance to William Taylor in 1718.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
Descendants of a James Foster believe he was the son of Robert and Elizabeth
Garnett Foster. If this is the case and James did live and marry twice (Elizabeth and Martha) and left descendants, if is difficult to understand why John and not James became heir at law for the inheritance, unless James was younger than John. It appears that additional research is needed into this James. This family of James is not documented. James Foster married (1) Elizabeth _?_ and (2) Martha _?_. Martha was born circa 1690 in Virginia. James&rsquo; children were: Thomas, George, and James (born before 1718).</P>

John Foster (Robert<SUP><I>1</I></SUP>) was born circa 1681-1689 in Gloucester County, Virginia and
died after 1760. John was born before his parents moved to Essex County. John married Isabella, thought to be a sister or daughter of John Golding of Essex County (not proven). John Golding is thought to be the father of the William Golding who married John&rsquo;s younger sister, Elizabeth Foster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
John married Isabella before 1721 in Essex County, the year that he and
Isabella bought land in Spotsylvania County, where they lived until 1741. They then moved in 1741 to a plantation on Beaverdam and Marsh Runs that John had purchased in western Orange County, Virginia. John was deeded 125 acres of land by his father (James chose the 75 acre plot). However he sold this land to his mother and her second husband, Robert Charleswood, since she was required by the will to turn over the plantation on which she lived to her son, Robert, Jr., heir-at-law of Robert Foster Sr., when she remarried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
John became heir-at-law of the land that had been deeded to his older brother, Robert Foster, Jr., when Robert died and left the land to his wife. John purchased the land and plantation from Ann Lloyd Foster, his sister-in-law, for 25 pounds sterling. John then sold the land and the plantation house to James Ridgeport. On December 2, 1721 he purchased 84 acres of land from Robert King in Spotsylvania County. It appears that John, Isabella and their
family moved into the plantation house. By this time John and Isabel
were the parents of two, possibly three, children: Sarah, Thomas,
and John, Jr.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
John Foster seemed to have been quite active in politics, since his name is
mentioned a number of times in the activities of Spotsylvania County:
witnessing deeds, wills, and serving for several years as deputy sheriff. In 1733 John received a land grant of 599 acres in what is now Culpeper County.  John and Isabella probably retained their home in Spotsylvania County. They were still living there in 1735 when he sold to John Rucker the 599 acres of land that he had patented in Culpeper County. At the time of the sale of this land, his wife Isabella was &ldquo;so sickly and impotent&rdquo; that she
could not travel to the seat of Orange County to waive her dower rights to the land. They had to send three commissioners to her home to interview her and make sure she had agreed to the sale.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
By 1735 John and Isabella had two, possibly three, additional children:
Philadelphia, Anthony, and possibly Judith. Though John and Isabella were living in Spotsylvania County, they began to purchase land in Orange County. John began to buy land in Orange County as early as 1734 or 1735. In 1734 Thomas, the oldest son of John and Isabella, was apparently not of legal age to own land (21 years), since in that year he and his father co-patented 1,000 acres of land in what is now the eastern portion of Orange County. The land was located between Berry&rsquo;s Run and Riga Run. William Wolford had
originally patented the land, but his patent had lapsed due to his not making sufficient improvements. John Foster may have patented this land for his son Thomas to improve and develop as a plantation. The land, or a portion of it, had been put into cultivation, since John was in Orange County on several occasions witnessing deeds. It is possible that his son, Thomas Foster, was living on the land and attending to it - clearing and cultivation. Thomas had not yet married.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
On November 26, 1740 John and Thomas Foster made an application to the Orange County Court for an evaluation of the improvements that had been made on this 1,000 acres of land. Andrew Harrison, Henry, Isabel and George Smith returned a report to the Orange County Court on May 28, 1741, giving a value of 164 pounds 6 shilling 8 pence which included &ldquo;the cost of 16 journey of 16 miles (from their home in Spotsylvania County) for corn and salt and of 4,000 nails brought from Northumberland County, one dwelling house, one small dwelling, 480 fruit trees, twelve acres of cleared ground, 280 panels of fence with nine logs to each panel.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
In 1739 and 1740 John and Isabella started selling off their holdings in
Spotsylvania County in the preparation for a move to Orange County in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. On May 28, 1741 John Foster bought from Joseph Phillips of Orange County a tract of 490 acres of land between March and Beaverdam Run in the Far West end of the present day Orange County, near the boundary of Greene County. Moving with John and Isabella were their son Thomas and his wife, Ann (Thomas had married Ann Garnett in 1741) and their daughter, Philadelphia and her husband, John Snell. In 1740 John Foster  witnessed a purchase of land by his son-in-law, John Snell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
In 1745 John and Thomas Foster sold the 1,000 acres of land they patented in 1734 and improved upon in Orange County to James Garnett, brother to Ann Garnett Foster. Actually, they had resold the land, since in 1738 they had sold the land to George Street. The land reverted back to them when Mr. Street was unable to make payment. Since this deed was acknowledged by both of their wives (Isabel Foster and Ann Foster) by their relinquishment of the dower rights to the land, it proves that Thomas Foster was married to Ann Garnett prior to February 1744. Since Thomas&rsquo; oldest child, Sarah was
born circa 1743 according to her will, it is certain that Thomas Foster was only married once and was not married circa 1743 to an Elizabeth Smith in Middlesex County, as claimed by some Foster researchers. Ann Foster was the only wife of Thomas Foster and the mother of his eleven children.

Isabella Foster died sometime after June 4, 1747, the date that she and her husband John Foster, along with John Haskew and his wife, Rachel, jointly sold to John Coffee of Spotsylvania County a tract of land in Orange County containing 137 acres (100 acres was taken from John Foster&rsquo;s tract of 337 acres and 37 acres were taken from Haskew&rsquo;s land). This land was located on Beaverdam Run and was part of the land that John Foster bought from Zachary Taylor in 1740. This was the last appearance of Isabella in the records of Orange County.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
In Orange County John Foster continued to be politically active with frequent references in county records witnessing deeds and wills of neighbors, providing security bonds, serving on juries and viewing routes of public roads. The last entry of John Foster in Orange County records was in 1760. No will has been found for John Foster. He either died in 1760, as some have recorded, was infirm shortly after, or moved away from Orange County to live
with one of his children until his death.</P>

<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">Thomas Foster was born circa 1715 in Essex County, and died in 1791 in
Orange County. He married circa 1741 in Essex County to Ann Garnett,
possibly daughter of Salvador and Elizabeth Muscoe Garnett. She was born circa 1720 in Essex County, and died after 1791 in Orange County. Their plantation was on the south side of the Po River. While Thomas was not of legal age (age to witness, etc.), his father and he patented 1,000 acres of land in 1743 in eastern Orange County on Riga Run just south of what is today, Unionville, Virginia. It is to be assumed that the land was improved by Thomas and his father, and was probably to be the home of Thomas when he became of age and married, or it could have been bought as an investment. However, Thomas and his father sold the improved land, all one thousand
acres, to James Garnett of Essex County, Virginia. Thomas Garnett is
thought to be Thomas Foster&rsquo;s brother-in-law.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
In 1741 Thomas Foster was granted a patent for 400 acres of land in Spotsylvania County &ldquo;amongst the branches of the Mattapony River,&rdquo; but on May 1, 1744, less than three months after he and his father had sold the 1,000 acres of land on Riga Run in St. Thomas Parish, Orange County, Virginia, Thomas sold this 400 acres. In the sale he gave his residence as &ldquo;of St. Mark&rsquo;s Parish, Orange County,&rdquo; thus indicating that he was then living in that part of Orange County north of the Rapidan River that is now Culpeper County. This move is proven by a lease dated three weeks later on May 23, 1744, when Thomas and Ann leased a plantation of 150 acres on the north side of the Rapidan River in St. Mark&rsquo;s Parish Orange County, Virginia (which is now Culpeper County) from the executors of the estate of the former royal governor, Alexander Spotswood. These 150 acres were a part of the 40,000 acre land patent called the &ldquo;Spotswood Tract.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Thomas and Ann Foster continued to live on this plantation in Culpeper County. They paid an annual rent of 800 lb. of tobacco until 1757. In was in that year that Thomas and Ann bought a plantation consisting of 975 acres of land on Mill Run. Mill Run is a tributary of Mount Run in St. Thomas Parish, in the eastern portion of Orange County. It was here that Thomas and Ann continued to raise their children and it was here that both died and were buried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
After their move back to Orange County, close neighbors of Thomas and Ann
Foster were the Jones family, Hugh and Elizabeth Jones. Elizabeth&rsquo;s
family name has not been positively identified. Morton is a possibility and there are those that believe that she was a Foster &ndash; daughter of Robert and Elizabeth Garnett Foster. Further research is needed to positively identify her. Apparently Elizabeth died and Hugh remarried a Cathy as she was named in his will. Her family name is also unidentified. Apparently Elizabeth was the mother of all of Hugh&rsquo;s children. Three Jones sons and a daughter, George, Morton, Benjamin and Frances married three daughters and one son of Thomas and Ann Foster &ndash; Phoebe, Frances, Elizabeth and Thomas.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
All eleven children of Thomas and Ann Foster moved to Wilkes County, North Carolina within a few years after the Revolutionary War. Two of the younger children, John and Lucy, remained in Orange County to look after their aging parents. Thomas Foster died in 1791 (testate), and Ann a few years later &ndash; apparently in 1798; as in 1799 John sold the land and plantation on Mill Run and he and Lucy also moved to Wilkes County.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
The parents of Ann Garnett have been identified as Thomas Garnett and Elizabeth Muscoe. Mrs. G. P. Knight in her Genealogy of the Garnett Family indicated that there are &ldquo;probably three Elizabeth Muscoe&rsquo;s that married into the Garnett family around 1700. One (1) is Elizabeth (1700-1736), daughter of Salvador Muscoe, Jr., who married Capt. James Garnett. Another seems to be (2) Elizabeth Muscoe (ca 1680 &ndash; 1750), who was a sister of Salvador, Jr., who married Thomas Garnett (ca 1675 &ndash; 1748). This is the Thomas Garnett most of us trace our lineage from. The third (3) Elizabeth (ca 1702 - ?) also married a Thomas Garnett. This Elizabeth and
Thomas have two children that have been identified &ndash; James and Ann W. Garnett.&rdquo; Mrs. King adds two more daughters &ndash; Joyce and Ave Garnett. These last two daughters have been supposedly identified in the will of the second Thomas and Elizabeth (Muscoe) Garnett. No matter where these daughters are put &ndash; they raise another question in the Garnett line. Note: both daughters married Andrews &ndash; Joyce married Thomas Andrews and Ave married a brother, Dr. Mark J. Andrews.</P>

John, Jr. and his family lived along the Orange and Louisa County line and
was recorded as buying and selling several tracts of land,possibly living on both sides of the county line. He was living in Orange County on August 22, 1745 near his father, John Foster, Sr. and his brother-in-law, John Snell, as indicated in the Orange County road construction and repair records. On March 18, 1749, John, Jr. bought 150 acres of land in Louisa County, now Albermarle County, from Benjamin Henson which bordered George Homes, on the Orange County line and on both sides of the main road, known as Durrett&rsquo;s Ordinary (An Ordinary was a tavern or inn.) He later sold this land to Hugh Boyle.</P>

During the early 1760s John Foster, Jr. was a member of Fredericksville Parish in Louisa County. This was the part of Louisa County, along the Orange County borderline, which later became a part of Albermarle County. In October of 1760 he was appointed as a reader at the Upper Church in the parish and was paid for previous service. He was elected vestryman of the newly created
Fredericksville Parish that was divided in 1762. He continued to serve as a vestryman, clerk, and reader until his death (testate) in 1764. The Will of John Foster, Jr.:</P>

Anthony Foster was the youngest son of John and Isabel Foster. He was born
circa 1727 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. He died on April 5, 1805 in Cross Anchor, Union County, South Carolina. He first married in the early 1750s in Orange County, Virginia to a Miss Tinsley (possibly Sarah) who is believed to be the daughter of Isaac and Margaret Tucker Tinsley. This is supported by family tradition, that one of Anthony&rsquo;s oldest sons was named Fielding Tinsley, and that Margaret Tucker&rsquo;s mother was Elizabeth Fielding. Anthony&rsquo;s first wife was born circa 1730 and died 1762 in Virginia. Anthony then married Sarah Golding before 1766, his first cousin, the daughter of William and Elizabeth Foster Golding (Anthony&rsquo;s Aunt and Uncle). She was born circa 1740 in Orange County and died on June 30, 1812 at Cross Anchor, Union County.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Anthony began his married life in Orange County (constituted in 1734 from
Spotsylvania County), where his first several children were born. Except from the years between 1765 until 1779, they lived in Orange County in the area near the current borders of Albermarle, Greene, and Madison Counties. Anthony had evidently inherited land there previously owned by his father, John Foster. The land was in the vicinity of Beaverdam, near John Haskew and William Lucas. Also living in the vicinity was Spencer Bobo. Anthony went on
a bond for Spencer Bobo when he was sued by James Duncanson. Spencer
Bobo&rsquo;s wife, Judith, was the likely youngest child of John and Isabel Foster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
In 1765 Anthony and his family moved to land in Orange County (now Greene county) in the Blue Ridge Mountains where he and his brother-in-law, Isaac Tinsley, Jr. jointly bought from Francis Dirkley&rsquo;s family in May. In 1766 Anthony and his family returned to the land that he had inherited from his father. On June 3, 1766, Henry Foster, of Albermarle County, Virginia, the eldest son and heir of Anthony Foster, brother to John Foster, Jr., sold to his uncle a tract 210 acres in Orange County, Virginia bordering the land of Anthony Foster and John Haskew. This deed was witnessed by John Foster (Henry&rsquo;s younger brother) and Spencer Bobo and his wife Judith.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
By 1779 Anthony and his family moved to Culpeper (now Madison) County to the area of Elk Run, a tributary of the Rapidan River, where he bought 162 acres of land from James Eastman and his wife, Sarah, on June 19, 1780. Earlier, on September 23, 1779, Anthony Foster and his wife, Sarah &ldquo;of Culpeper County&rdquo; sold to John Marshfield of Albermarle county, a 170 acre tract in Orange County on Beaverdam, which was &ldquo;formerly the property of
Anthony Foster&rsquo;s father and now occupied by Bartlett Bennett.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
By 1785 Anthony and his family moved back to Orange (now Greene) County, where he was found on the tax list in the Fredericksville Parish area, where his late brother, John Foster&rsquo;s grandchildren, were living. Anthony Foster was taxed for himself, sixteen slaves, seven horses or mules, and nine head of cattle. Joel Foster, the son of Anthony Foster and his first wife,
was enumerated just after his father on the 1787 Albermarle County, Virginia tax list. This was just before Joel&rsquo;s leaving Virginia for Newberry District, South Carolina where he is found on the 1790 Federal Census.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
On October 16, 1787, Anthony Foster &ldquo;of Albermarle County&rdquo;
bought from Lewis Garr and his wife, Catherine, of Orange County a 200 acre tract of land in Orange County (now Green). Anthony and Sarah, now &ldquo;of Rockingham County&rdquo;, were living just across the Blue Ridge Mountains in 1792. This sale disposed of their remaining land in Virginia. Anthony and Sarah and their children sold most of their belongings, loaded up their wagons and started for the long trek to South Carolina. Anthony appeared on the Spartanburg District records beginning in 1793, arriving sometime
between 1792 and 1793. Anthony was over sixty years of age, an advanced age for such a long trip to start a new life. His older children were grown and his younger children were still in their teens. He may have made the move to give his children a better opportunity. Land was cheap and plentiful in South Carolina. Maybe he wanted his children to have a new beginning where the soil was fertile and there was plenty for patenting. He probably corresponded with his son, Joel, and several cousins who were now living in South Carolina. Joel, the eldest of the surviving sons of Anthony Foster by his first wife, (possibly Isaac Tinsley&rsquo;s sister) preceded his father to South Carolina by a few years, having located in Newberry District prior to the 1790 census. Joel lived by his deceased mother&rsquo;s relative on Little River. Joel later moved to the Cross Keys area of Union County, South Carolina near his younger half-brothers after his father&rsquo;s death. Anthony Foster&rsquo;s first cousin, Thomas Meador Foster, had lived in South Carolina for years, making surveys of land patent and sales. His uncle, Thomas Foster, died there. For whatever reason, Anthony Foster and his entire family made the long trip, across North Carolina and into South Carolina. They settled in Spartanburg District.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
Anthony survived this resettlement for ten years. He died on April 5, probably near eighty years of age. Sarah died seven years later on June 30,
1812. Both are buried in marked graves, along side of their good friend

William Foster (Robert<SUP><I>1</I></SUP>) was born circa 1691-1698 in Essex County, Virginia and died
circa August 27, 1767 in Amelia County, Virginia, age 76. He was usually referred to as &ldquo;The Elder.&rdquo; He married twice, his first wife has not been identified, but she was the mother of his first five children. His second wife was Ann Booker, daughter of Richard and Rachel Webb Booker (several reports state that Ann&rsquo;s mother was Rebecca Cobbes). William and Ann married circa 1748. Ann was born circa 1726 in Virginia and died in 1790 in Amelia County. They had four children, all born in Amelia County.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
William began his married life in Essex County. Later, William along with his
sister, Barbara Loving and his brother, Thomas and their families, moved to Amelia County as early as 1736, when they were enumerated in the Amelia County tax list among the tithable inhabitants between Flat Creek and Deep Creek. In 1742 William patented 400 acres of land in Amelia County on the headwaters of Beaver Pond and branch of Flat Creek and then purchased an adjoining 353 acres of land from Irby Hudson. In 1746 he patented 13 acres in Lunenburg (Charlotte) County on the water of Spring Creek and Ash Camp Creek on Meherrin River in the same vicinity where his brother, George had settled in 1750.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
William made his will in 1763, which was probated in 1767. In his will he listed his wife, Ann. He gave his sons William, James, and John the land on which they were living in Lunenburg County. This land was the 1,340 acres that William patented in 1760. He probably purchased the land, in what would become Charlotte County, when his son, William came of age. As  William&rsquo;s other brothers, Thomas and James also came of age; they also  
occupied a portion of the original patent. In his will, William also left to his sons, John, Richard, and Booker his plantation and land in Amelia County. When William&rsquo;s will was drawn his two daughters were not married. Later, in 1764 Mary married John Mitchell. His daughter, Elizabeth, married Benjamin Hubbard in 1782, however she had borne a child, Achilles Foster, out of wedlock in 1759.</P>

Brother of George Foster</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
Thomas Foster (Robert<SUP><I>1</I></SUP>) was born circa 1696 in Essex County, Virginia and died circa
1769 in Craven County, South Carolina, age 73. Thomas married, first, Elizabeth Meador circa 1718. Elizabeth was probably a Meador since there were  Meador families in Essex County and the fact that he had a son Alexius Meador. Their marriage date is unknown. Thomas married, second, Carolyn Rogers on August 25, 1761 in Prince Edward County, Virginia. He was born in
Essex County not long after the family moved from Gloucester County.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
Thomas and Elizabeth probably married in Essex County, the part that became
Caroline County, where their first four children were born. They moved from Caroline County to Amelia County in 1737. In June 10, 1737 Thomas Foster received a royal land grant of 350 acres of land on Stock Creek in what is now the northwest corner of Amelia County south of the Appomattox River. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
After moving to Amelia County, they built their plantation house, outbuildings, cleared the land and planted orchards. Thomas may have written  his sister, Barbara Loving, to urge her and her family to leave Essex County and join them, which they did. In 1739 Thomas Foster sold to Richard and Barbara Loving 150 acres of the 350 he patented in 1737. The land was part of a tract on the upper side of Stock Creek. Thomas may have written his mother, who remarried after his father died. She and her husband Robert Charlesworth also moved from Essex to Amelia County where they built their home adjacent to Thomas Foster. In 1741 &ldquo;for reason of the dutiful regard he hath for his mother, the said Elizabeth Charlesworth,&rdquo; he deeded &ldquo;one part of land (50 acres) it being the land on which the said Robert Charlesworth now liveth.&rdquo; The fifty acres was part of the 350 acres patented by Thomas Foster. This is more proof that Robert Foster, Sr. was only married once - to Elizabeth Garnett. Thomas calls Elizabeth Garnett Foster Charlesworth, his mother. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
Robert Charlesworth died in Amelia County prior to June 22, 1745 when the
administration of his estate was awarded to Edward Booker. Elizabeth Foster Charlesworth probably died before her husband, sometime between 1742 and 1745, buried there in Amelia County.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
After the death of his mother and stepfather, Thomas Foster moved to
Spotsylvania County. From deed records we know that Thomas and his underage children were in Spotsylvania County as early as 1745, since in that year he bought land there. From the time he moved to Spotsylvania he became known as Thomas Foster, surgeon. Sometime prior to his move to Spotsylvania County it is likely he received training as a physician, probably an apprenticeship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
Thomas Foster practiced medicine in Spotsylvania County for a decade before
he returned to the Appomattox River area, this time to Cumberland County just north of Amelia County where he continued his practice of medicine. He later moved to the coastal area of South Carolina where he practiced medicine until his died in 1769. He died in St. James Santee Parish, Craven County, South Carolina. His son, Alexis Meador Foster was executor of his estate. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
Before he moved to South Carolina, Thomas Foster&rsquo;s son Alexis Meador received training as a surveyor and subsequently moved to South Carolina. Alexius Meador Foster patented much of the land in the proximity of Spartanburg and Union Districts where he was heavily involved in surveying land grants. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0; text-indent: 0.15in">
Dr. Foster&rsquo;s first wife, Elizabeth probably died before he moved to South Carolina and is probably the Thomas Foster who married on August 25, 1761 to Caroline Rogers of Prince Edward County, Virginia, where he probably was practicing medicine.</P>

Anthony Foster (Robert<SUP><I>1</I></SUP>) was born circa 1693-1698 in Essex County, Virginia and died on
February 4, 1763 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, at age 70. He was born ca 1698 or before, since he witnessed a deed on December 1, 1719 when his brother, John Foster, bought 100 acres of land in St. Anne&rsquo;s Parish, Essex County from Wm. Stapp and Joshus Stapp for 20 pounds sterling (legal age was 21 years for witnessing). Anthony married Martha circa 1720 in Essex County.

They moved from St. Anne&rsquo;s Parish, Essex County after 1725, on May 3rd of that year they recorded a purchase from Robert King of 100 acres of land in St. George Parish, Spotsylvania County on the south side of the Po River. It bordered land that his brother, John Foster had purchased from Robert King on December 12, 1721.

During the next several years Anthony accumulated considerable land, purchasing 1,657 acres of land in one transaction (he turned around and sold it back to the man from who he had originally purchased it) and 105 acres in another transaction in 1740, 331 acres in 1744, 135 acres in 1746 and on March 16, 1754 he purchased 550 acres, all in St. George Parish. There is no indication that he lived on any of this acreage but remained on the original 100 acres he purchased in 1721.

Martha Foster died after 1740 and before 1761, as 1740 was the date of the
birth of their last child and 1761 was the date of a deed transaction which lists a Sarah as Anthony&rsquo;s wife. In the deed transactions in
1755 and 1759 there was no mention of a wife. It appears that Anthony remarried sometime between 1759 and 1761 and Martha died between 1740 and 1755. The Sarah was a Mrs. Sarah Sparks, widow of Zachary Sparks. However, Martha was the mother of all seven of Anthony&rsquo;s children.</P>

Elizabeth Foster (Robert<SUP><I>1</I></SUP>) was born circa 1703 in Essex County, Virginia and died before 1777 in Ninety-Six District, South Carolina. Her father died when she
was young and she was raised by her mother and stepfather. She married William Golding in 1728 (estimated) in Caroline County, Virginia. William Golding, born circa 1704 in Essex County, was the son of John Golding and Mrs. Cassandra Wood and resided in Caroline County. By 1741 William Golding and his family had moved up the Mattaponi River to the northwest, toward the frontier land that had been opened in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Orange County. Their land was near that of John Foster, Elizabeth&rsquo;s older brother. They lived in Orange County from around 1741 to circa 1746 near the Orange County courthouse and from circa 1746 to 1771 near the Blue Ridge Mountains in what is now Greene County. They moved to the Ninety Six District in the frontier land of the upland of South Carolina in 1771.</P>

William Golding signed his last will and testament on September 4, 1777.

Robert Singleton, was born in 1652 in Gloucester County, Virginia and died in 1725. He married (1) Sarah Crow and (2) Elizabeth _?_. Robert and Sarah had four known children: Susanna, Joshua, Robert and <B>Mary Charlotte</B>. Robert Singleton had extensive land holdings in early Virginia. He lived in Gloucester County at the time of death, but he also owned land in Stafford
County. There are land records of this Robert in early Virginia records. In 1704, Robert paid quick-rent on 650 acres in Gloucester County, Kingston Parish. In 1705, Robert Singleton was granted 600 acres of land in Stafford County. His will named his daughter &ldquo;Mary, wife of George Foster.&rdquo;</P>

George Foster was literate, obtaining his education in Essex County where he

George was mentioned in the will of Robert Singleton, &ldquo;. . . and the other three hundred acres belonging to that patent I give to my two daughters, Susannah, the wife of Thomas Smithers, and Mary, the wife of George Foster.&rdquo; This land was in Stafford County, which was later broken into an additional County called Prince William. Apparently George and Mary lived on the land given them in
the will, since their children were listed as born in Prince William County.</P>

In 1734 they were living in Caroline County in the part of Essex County that was cut off when Caroline County was established in 1727-28.

George and his family moved to Lunenburg County, the Charlotte County area of southern Virginia, where many of his children lived. His sons Josiah and George Jr. and his daughter Elizabeth Dabbs were there early (Elizabeth, wife of Richard Dabbs who was the brother of our <B>Nathaniel Dabbs</B>). There is evidence that most of the family located in Charlotte, Lunenburg, and Amelia Counties. On June 1, 1750, he bought land in Lunenburg County, receiving a grant of nine hundred and eighty-five acres &ldquo;on both sides of Spring Creek Fork of Little Roanoke,&rdquo; adjoining the land of Joseph Morton,
Clement Reed, and a Mr. Womack. George and his family were also found in Stafford/Prince William/Fairfax County before they finally settled in Charlotte County. On August 10, 1756, George received a grant of an additional four hundred acres in Lunenburg County, later Charlotte County, on Cock&rsquo;s and Laton&rsquo;s Creek. This is where he made his will on February 17, 1789 and where he died, since his will was probated there on June 1, 1789. Mary Singleton Foster died prior to George&rsquo;s death. Her death is estimated to be about 1780 in Charlotte County. Mary was about 43 when her last child was born. It is possible that she died not too many years later, since she was still young enough to bear more children.</P>

Michael Motes stated: Although not yet fully documented, I am confident that
Francis Foster, for whom Robert Haney states in his pension application he served in the Revolutionary War, was the brother of Elizabeth Foster, who married Robert Haney&rsquo;s half-brother John Haney, Jr. (c. 1748-bet. 1775-1776). This Francis Foster was also the first cousin of Robert Haney&rsquo;s half-sister Elizabeth Haney who married Nathaniel Dabbs and left Charlotte Co., VA settling first in Anson Co., NC and later in Union Co., SC, where his will was probated in 1800, having been witnessed by his brother-in-law Timothy Haney, another half-brother of <B>Nathaniel Dabbs&rsquo; wife Elizabeth Haney Dabbs</B> but probably a full brother of Robert Haney.</P>

George Jr. started his family in Luneburg County. He acquired large land
holding in Luneburg and Caroline Counties. At the age of 35, George Foster Jr. died in Luneburg County. He left his wife, Mary and three living children. A daughter was born shortly after his death. His will <A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote17anc" HREF="#sdendnote17sym">(17)</A> 
was dated August 30, 1762, recorded October 5, 1762. He gave his wife Mary &ldquo;the plantation where I now live for widowhood and after her death of remarriage, this is to go to my son John Foster and his heirs. To my son Josiah, the tract of land purchased from Moses Hall containing 200 acres. To my daughter Sarah, the land in Caroline County containing 200 acres. The residue of my estate to be divided between my wife Mary and my three children, John, Josiah, and Sarah at the discretion of my executors.&rdquo; It was noted that the children were all under age. George Jr. was unaware at the time of preparing his will (he was probably on his deathbed) that Frances Ann was on the way. She was not mentioned in the will.</P>

Mary Foster, the widow, later married a Thomas Buckner. The oldest son John, for some reason, was made the ward of his Uncle William Foster. The following interesting court record is found in Charlotte County records: &ldquo;2 October 1769, We Thomas Buckner and Mary Buckner, wife of said Thomas Buckner, for and in consideration of the sum of 15 pounds lawful money of Virginia to them I hand paid by William Foster, guardian of John Foster, son and heir of George Foster, the receipt is hereby acknowledged, have devised, rebound, and forever quit claim unto John Foster heir of George Foster deceased in fifty six acres of land being all Mary Buckner&rsquo;s dower which she held in right of her late husband George Foster, being part of a tract of one hundred sixty eight acres lying on Spring Creek, being the
plantation whereon the said Mary his wife now lives. The residue the
said land being willed to John Foster, son and heir of the said
George Foster.&rdquo; It is not known why was John was made a ward of his Uncle William. It may have been necessary for William to force this action and pay for land that already belonged to his ward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
A more interesting record comes from the deed books of Charlotte County, dated October 1797, thirty-eight years later. Remember that Uncle William Foster was administrator of the estate of Josiah Foster, Jr., another son of George Foster Jr. Apparently action was taken to obtain Josiah&rsquo;s inheritance for his orphan children. This interesting record also proves the ancestral claim &ndash; Richard Foster, Josiah Foster Jr &ndash; George Foster Jr.</P>

The Foster family were in Virginia for many years. Many branches of the family lived near and in Charlotte County at this time. A land transaction in Charlotte County illustrates how close their residences were. The deed transfer was in 1798, from a Mr. Page to a Mr. Neville. The description: &ldquo;One hundred forty four acres bounded as follows, beginning at a white oak on George Foster&rsquo;s son of William Foster to a corner red oak and thence along James Johnson&rsquo;s line to George Foster&rsquo;s line, son of Josiah Foster and thence along George Foster&rsquo;s line to John Foster&rsquo;s line, then along John Foster&rsquo;s line to the beginning.&rdquo;</P>

1797, George was still in Charlotte County. He was present at the sale of the personal items from Josiah Foster Jr.&rsquo;s estate. As a purchaser in the court records, he is listed as George Foster, son of William. It is believed that he was still in Charlotte County, Virginia in 1804. His daughter was married in that year in Charlotte County to Richard Foster. The Charlotte County record: &ldquo;28 Aug. 1804.

According to a descendant, Mrs. Ruby Michael of Parma, Missouri, George Foster exercised his option for War Bounty Land. He received land on Morgan Creek, Hickman County, Tennessee in 1815. We know he was in Hickman County in 1832. He applied for a pension for Revolutionary War Service. The application, in his own words as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
&ldquo;I was mastered (mustered) into service at the court house of said County (Charlotte) as a militia. Marched from Thence to Petersburg and there remained until discharged after having served a tour of three months. From there I went home. This tour was performed in the year 1780. After this I volunteered to serve a tour of 6 weeks in 1781 which was received as one of six months by the State of Virginia. Under Captain Spencer we were marched to Guilford Court House, North Carolina and fought the battle known in history by that name which battle I was in. From there we marched to Deep Ramsey&rsquo;s Mill where I was mastered (mustered) out of service for a tour of six months although I did not actually serve that long.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
George&rsquo;s pension application was denied by the War Department because he did not serve six months minimum service and he did not have a clergyman witness his application. He had already received bounty land however!</P>

George Foster was involved in the settlement of his father&rsquo;s William&rsquo;s will in 1824. He was an executor of the estate of his sister-in-law in the 1830s.

John Haney first appeared on a 1750 List of Tithables, Lunenburg County,
Virginia, taken by Abraham Martin, with 1 tithe. He was residing near George Foster, Senior. John Haney was found in various court records from 1752 to 1791. In 1752, in Lunenburg County, John was the plaintiff in one case and provided bail for a Godfrey Jones, defendant, in another case. That John Haney married the daughter of George Foster and was the father of Elizabeth Haney is proven by the following deeds:</P>

It is almost certain that this is our John Haney, father of <B>Elizabeth
Haney Dabbs</B>, due to the amount of land he had. On March 2, 1762, John Haney purchased &ldquo;approximately 482.5 acres&rdquo; from Godfrey Jones in Lunenburg County. <A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote31anc" HREF="#sdendnote31sym">(31)</A> This land, added to the 100 acres from his father-in-law George Foster in 1753, totaled to 583 acres. The listing above implies: (1) John Haney, father of Elizabeth, had a son John who was aged 16 or older by 1764, therefore born by 1748. If this is the case, he would
probably also be a grandson of George Foster, but no provision was made for him by his grandfather; or (2) John Haney&rsquo;s father, also John or &ldquo;Jno.&rdquo; Haney was living with him at the time of the 1764 list. The second tithable in John Haney&rsquo;s household could be his son-in-law <B>Nathaniel Dabbs</B>, who married John Haney&rsquo;s daughter.</P>

Michael Motes states that one of the children of George Foster and Sarah Low is a Frances Ann Foster who married a James Haney on April 19, 1785 in Charlotte County, Virginia. James was born circa 1760 in Charlotte County, Virginia. There is no documentation that this James Haney was a son of the John Haney who married &ldquo;Miss&rdquo; Foster. This James Haney, of Orange County was a Virginia Revolutionary War Pensioner. He was a private in the Virginia Continental and died on May 7, 1833. Motes found a South Carolina
record that lists a James Hayney as an early settler in Union County (1788) and a James Hayney appointed by the court to lay out a road (1798).</P>
