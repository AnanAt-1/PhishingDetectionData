Air  Corps  of  the  Army  of  the  United  States,  and  for  other  purposes. 
******* 

Sec.  11.  Under  such  rules  and  regulations  as  he  may  prescribe  the  President  is  hereby 
authorized  to  present,  but  not  in  the  name  of  Congress,  a  medal  to  be  known  as  the  soldier's 
medal,  of  appropriate  design,  with  accompanying  ribbon,  to  any  person  who,  while  serving 
in  any  capacity  with  the  Army  of  the  United  States,  including  the  National  Guard  and  the 
Organized  Reserves,  shall  hereafter  distinguish  himself,  or  herself,  by  heroism  not  involving 
actual  conflict  with  an  enemy. 

No  more  than  one  soldier's  medal  shall  be  issued  to  any  one  person;  but  for  each  suc- 
ceeding deed  or  act  sufficient  to  justify  the  award  of  the  soldier's  medal  the  President  may 
award  a  suitable  bar,  or  other  suitable  device,  to  be  worn  as  he  shall  direct. 

Sec.  12.  Under  such  rules  and  regulations  as  he  may  prescribe,  and  notwithstanding  the 
provisions  of  section  14  of  this  Act,  the  President  is  hereby  authorized  to  present,  but  not 
in  the  name  of  Congress,  a  distinguished  flying  cross  of  appropriate  design,  with  accom- 
panying ribbon,  to  any  person  who,  while  serving  in  any  capacity  with  the  Air  Corps  of  the 
Army  of  the  United  States,  including  the  National  Guard  and  the  Organized  Reserves,  or 
with  the  United  States  Navy,  since  the  6th  day  of  April,  1917,  has  distinguished,  or  who, 
after  the  approval  of  this  Act,  distinguishes  himself  by  heroism  or  extraordinary  achievement 
while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight:  Provided,  That  no  person  shall  be  eligible  for  the  award 
of  the  distinguished  flying  cross  for  any  act  performed  prior  to  November  11,  1918,  except 
officers  or  enlisted  men  who  have  heretofore  been  recommended  for  but  have  not  received  the 
congressional  medal  of  honor,  the  distinguished  service  cross,  or  the  distinguished  service 
medal  and  except  those  officers  or  enlisted  men  who  displayed  heroism  while  serving  as  in- 
structors or  students  at  flying  schools.  No  more  than  one  distinguished  flying  cross  shall 
be  issued  to  any  one  person,  but  for  each  succeeding  act  or  achievement  sufficient  to  justify 
the  award  of  a  distinguished  flying  cross  the  President  may  award  a  suitable  bar  or  other 
suitable  device  to  be  worn  as  he  shall  direct.  In  case  an  individual  who  distinguishes  himself 
shall  have  died  before  the  making  of  the  award  to  which  he  may  be  entitled,  the  award  may 
nevertheless  be  made  and  the  cross  or  the  bar  or  other  device  presented  to  such  representa- 
tive of  the  deceased  as  the  President  may  designate,  but  no  cross,  bar,  or  other  device  herein- 
before authorized  shall  be  awarded  or  presented  to  any  individual  whose  entire  service 
subsequent  to  the  time  he  distinguishes  himself  has  not  been  honorable. 

Sec.  13.  Each  enlisted  or  enrolled  man  to  whom  there  shall  be  awarded  the  distinguished 
flying  cross  or  the  soldier's  medal  shall  be  entitled  to  additional  pay  at  the  rate  of  $2  per 
month  from  the  date  of  the  act  of  heroism  or  extraordinary  achievement  on  which  the  award 
is  based,  and  each  bar,  or  other  suitable  device,  in  lieu  of  the  distinguished  flying  cross  or 
the  soldier's  medal,  as  hereinbefore  provided  for,  shall  entitle  him  to  further  additional  pay 
at  the  rate  of  $2  per  month  from  the  date  of  the  act  of  heroism  or  extraordinary  achievement 
for  which  the  bar  or  other  device  is  awarded,  and  said  additional  pay  shall  continue  through- 
out his  active  service,  whether  such  service  shall  or  shall  not  be  contii&gt;uous. 

Approved,  July  2,  1926.

First  lieutenant.  Company  H,  364th  Infantry,  91st  Division. 

For  conspicuous  gallantry  and  intrepidity  above  and  beyond  the  call  of  duty  in 
action  with  the  enemy  near  Eclisfontaine,  France,  Sept.  26-27,  1918.  On  the 
morning  of  Sept.  26,  during  the  advance  of  the  364th  Infantry,  Lieutenant 
Bronson  was  struck  by  an  exploding  enemy  hand  grenade,  receiving  deep  cuts 
on  his  face  and  the  back  of  his  head.  He  nevertheless  participated  in  the 
action  which  resulted  in  the  capture  of  an  enemy  dugout  from  which  a  great 
number  of  prisoners  were  taken.  This  was  effected  with  difficulty  and  under 
extremely  hazardous  conditions  because  it  was  necessary  to  advance  without 
the  advantage  of  cover  and,  from  an  exposed  position,  throw  hand  grenades 
and  phosphorous  bombs  to  compel  the  enemy  to  surrender.  On  the  afternoon 
of  the  same  day  he  was  painfully  wounded  in  the  left  arm  by  an  enemy  rifle 
bullet,  and  after  receiving  first-aid  treatment  he  was  directed  to  the  rear. 
Disregarding  these  instructions  Lieutenant  Bronson  remained  on  duty  with 
his  company  through  the  night  although  suffering  from  severe  pain  and  shock. 
On  the  morning  of  Sept.  27,  his  regiment  resumed  its  attack,  the  object  being 
the  village  of  Eclisfontaine.  Company  H,  to  which  Lieutenant  Bronson  was 
assigned,  was  left  in  support  of  the  attacking  line.  Company  E  being  in  the 
line.  He  gallantly  joined  that  company  in  spite  of  his  wounds  and  engaged 
with  it  in  the  capture  of  the  village.  After  the  capture  he  remained  with  Com- 
pany E  and  participated  with  it  in  the  capture  of  an  enemy  machine  gun,  he 
himself  killing  the  enemy  gunner.  Shortly  after  this  encounter  the  company 
was  compelled  to  retire  due  to  the  heavy  enemy  artillery  barrage.  During  this 
retirement  Lieutenant  Bronson,  who  was  the  last  man  to  leave  the  advanced 
position,  was  again  wounded  in  both  arms  by  an  enemy  high-explosive  shell. 
He  was  then  assisted  to  cover  by  another  officer  who  applied  first  aid.  Al- 
though bleeding  profusely  and  faint  from  the  loss  of  blood.  Lieutenant  Bronson 
remained  with  the  survivors  of  the  company  throughout  the  night  of  the  sec- 
ond day,  refusing  to  go  to  the  rear  for  treatment.  His  conspicuous  gallantry 
and  spirit  of  self-sacrifice  were  a  source  ofgreat  inspiration  to  the  members  of 
the  entire  command. 

Major  General,  IT.  S.  Army,  retired. 

For  his  fife  of  splendid  public  service,  begun  on  Mar.  27, 1844,  having  enlisted  as  a 
private  in  the  United  States  Army  on  July  26,  1861,  and  by  successive  promo- 
tions was  commissioned  as  major  general  Feb.  10, 1906,  and  retired  by  operation 
of  law  on  his  sixty-fourth  birthday. 

Captain,  Air  Corps  Reserve,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  displaying  heroic  courage  .id  skill  as  a  navigator,  at  the  risk  of  his  life,  by 
his  nonstop  flight  in  his  ai-^&lt;iane.  the  Spirit  of  St.  Louis,  from  New  York  City 
to  Paris,  France,  May  ^(1-21,  1927,  by  which  Captain  Lindbergh  not  only 
achieved  the  greatest  virtlividual  triumph  of  any  American  citizen  but  demon- 
strated that  travel  ■•  ^ss  the  ocean  by  aircraft  was  possible. 


Second  lieutenant.  Company  K,  28th  Infantry,  1st  Division. 

For  conspicuous  gallantry  and  intrepidity  above  and  beyond  the  call  of  duty  in 
action  with  the  enemy  near  Soissons,  France,  July  18-19,  1918.  During  the 
attack,  the  2d  and  3d  battalions  of  the  28th  Infantry  were  merged,  and  after 
several  hours  of  severe  fighting,  successfully  established  a  front-line  position. 
In  so  doing,  a  gap  was  left  between  the  right  flank  of  the  French  153d  Division 
on  their  left  and  the  left  flank  of  the  28th  Infantry,  exposing  the  left  flank  to  a 
terrific  enfilade  fire  from  several  enemy  machine  guns  located  in  a  rock  quarry 
on  high  ground.  Lieutenant  Parker,  observing  this  serious  situation,  ordered 
his  depleted  platoon  to  follow  him  in  an  attack  upon  the  strong  point.  Meet- 
ing a  disorganizeil  group  of  French  Colonials  wandering  leaderlessly  about,  he 
persuaded  them  to  join  his  platoon.  This  consolidated  group  followed  Lieu- 
tenant Parker  through  direct  enemy  rifle  and  macliinc-gun  fire  to  the  crest  of 
the  hill  and,  rushing  forward,  took  the  quarry  by  storm,  capturing  six  ma- 
chine guns  and  about  40  prisoners.  The  next  day  when  the  assault  was  con- 
tinued, tyieutenant  Parker  in  command  of  the  merged  2d  and  3d  battalions

were  a  source  of  great  inspiration  to  the  members  of  the  entire  command.

Bugler,  Company  D,  111th  Infantry,  28th  Division. 

While  on  duty  as  a  runner  carrying  messages  to  company  commanders  across 
heavily  shelled  areas,  Bugler  Abbot  discovered  an  officer  lying  severely 
wounded  out  in  advance  of  the  line.  After  delivering  his  messages  he  volun- 
teered to  rescue  this  officer  unaided  and  in  so  doing  he  himself  was  badly 
wounded. 

Sergeant,  Battery  A,  10th  Field  Artillery,  3d  Division. 

Sergeant  Abercrombie,  in  charge  of  the  ammunition  detail,  realizing  that  all  the 
ammunition  at  the  guns  had  been  used  by  a  barrage  to  prevent  the  enemy 
from  crossing  the  Marne  River,  immediately  organized  his  detail  and  carried 
ammunition  by  hand  from  scattered  piles  whose  locations  wert  known  to  him 
alone,  to  the. battery  position,  a  distance  of  about  a  kilcmeter.  While  so 
engaged,  he  was  severely  wounded  but  refused  to  be  evacuated.  After  receiv- 
ing first-aid  treatment  he  ordered  that  he  be  placed  in  a  shallow  trench,  from 
which  place  he  directed  the  carriers  to  the  various  kinds  of  ammunition  and 
fuses,  thus  continuing  the  supply  of  ammunition  to  the  guns.  His  bravery 
and  utter  disregard  of  his  wounded  condition  were  an  inspiration  to  his 
comrades. 

Private,  Company  H,  355th  Infantry,  89th  Division. 

Private  Alendal  volunteered  as  a  member  of  a  patrol  which  was  to  cross  the 
Meuse  River  by  swimming,  ata  point  known  to  be  heavily  occupied  by  enemy 
detachments,  on  thenight  of  Nov.  9-10, 1918,  to  gain  information  of  theeneony 
and  to  capture  prisoners.  When  the  members  of  the  patrol  reached  the 
middle  of  the  river,  they  were  discovered  by  the  enemy  who  immediately 
opened  a  severe  fire  upon  them  using  artillery,  machine  guns,  and  hand 
grenades.  The  heavy  fire  compelled  all  but  6  men  to  return.  With  utter 
disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety  Private  Alendal,  one  of  the  remaining 
members,  continued  to  proceed  until  he  made  the  supreme  sacrifice  while 
endeavoring  to  carry  out  the  mission. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  Knut  Alendal. 

Second  lieutenant.  Company  A,  28th  Infantry,  1st  Division. 

For  extraordinary  heroism  in  action  during  the  attack  on  Berzy-ie-Sec,  France, 
July  21. 1918.  Lieutenant  Andreitsshov.e6  utterdisregard  for  personal  danger 
in  leading  his  platoon  in  the  assault.  After  being  wounded  he  with  his  men 
captured  several  prisoners  and  organized  the  positions  taken. 

Major,  Medical  Corps,  attached  to  309th  Field  Artillery,  78th  Division. 

The  mess  trench  at  Headquarters,  155th  Infantry  Brigade,  was  struck  by  a 
shell  as  the  officers  were  sitting  down  to  their  evening  meal,  several  being 
killed  and  a  greater  nimiber  wounded  by  the  shell  exploding  on  the  edge  of  the 
trench.  Major  Ashton  on  hearing  of  the  disaster  insisted  on  going  with  the 
ambulances  himself,  notwithstanding  that  the  road  to  and  the  terrain  occupied 
by  the  brigade  were  under  heavy  artillery  fire.  With  great  courage  he  ren- 
dered aid  to  the  wounded,  during  which  time  he  was  suhjecteci  to  constant 
explosion  of  phosgene  shells  and,  in  order  to  perform  his  duties,  he  was  forced 
to  remove  his  gas  mask. 

First  lieutenant.  Company  L,  318th  Infantry,  80th  Division. 

On  the  night  of  Nov.  4,  1918,  when  the  left  of  the  division  was  counterattacked 
and  temporarily  driven  back  from  La  Tliihaudine  Farm,  though  passed  by 
the  retiring  front  lines  and  under  no  obligation  to  remain  in  advance  of  them, 
Lieutenant B«?7e.t;  and  a  companion,  although  having  been  advised  to  with- 
draw, nevertheless,  decided  to  remain  and  continued  throughout  the  night 
several  hundred  yards  beyond  the  divisional  outposts  in  an  exposed  locality 
well  known  to  the  enemy,  where  thej'  were  swept  by  cross-fire  of  machine 
guns  and  under  an  intensive  artillery  bombardment,  both  by  onemy  guns 
and  by  our  own  fire.  From  this  position  they  continued  to  render  reports 
of  hostile  movements  over  a  telephone  line,  maintained  at  the  greatest  personal 
risk,  to  such  good  purpose  that  the  attack  of  the  division,  renewed  on  the 
morning  of  Nov.  5,  1918.  was  a  complete  succass.  To  this  voluntary 
e.xposure  and  gallantry  in  disregard  of  self  is  due  in  large  measure  the  success 
of  the  division  in  carrying  out  the  mission  assigned  to  it.

Lieutenant  Hanks  led  a  platoon  in  a  raid  on  the  village  of  ITaumont,  displaying 
excellent  skill  and  leadership  in  getting  the  platoon  into  the  designated  posi- 
tion under  an  intense  and  highly  concentrated  enemy  artillery  and  machine- 
gun  Are.  Upon  entering  the  village  Lieutenant  Banks  personally  captured  a 
machine  gun  and  then,  with  the  assistance  of  two  runners,  captured  eleven 
prisoners  from  adjacent  dugouts. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

Lieutenant  Banks  is  also  awarded  an  Oak- Leaf  Cluster  for  the  following  act  of 
extraordinary  heroism  in  action  during  the  attack  on  Cote-de-Chatillon, 
France,  Oct.  14-16,  1918.  Lieutenant  Banks  led  his  platoon  in  repeated 
attacks  on  the  strongly  fortified  enemy  position.  When  his  company  com- 
mander was  wounded,  Lieutenant  Banks  assumed  command  of  the  company 
and,  by  personal  observation  under  fire  of  enemy  snipers  and  machine  gun- 
ners, obtained  valuable  information  relative  to  the  enemy's  lines.  He  led 
his  company  across  an  open  field  in  the  final  attack  under  heavy  enemy 
machine-gun  and  rifle  fire  and  was  among  the  first  to  reach  the  objective. 
After  consolidating  his  position  Lieutenant  Banks,  under  a  heavy  hostile 
barrage,  again  formed  his  company  to  resist  the  counterattack  and  by  his 
skill  and  bravery  was  mainly  r&amp;sponsible  for  its  repulse.  Throughout  the 
3  days  Lieutenant  Banks  demonstrated  great  leadership  and  utter  disregard 
for  his  own  personal  safety,  thereby  setting  a  splendid  example  of  courage 
and  devotion  to  duty  to  the  men  of  his  command. 

Seraeant,  Battery  B,  10th  Field  Artillery,  3d  Division. 

Sergeant  Barnes,  while  in  charge  of  a  detached  piece,  by  his  bravery,  courage, 
and  devotion  to  duty  greatly  inspired  his  men  at  all  times.  When  an  enemy 
shell  either  killed  or  wounded  his  entire  gun  crew  excepting  one  man,  he, 
although  painfully  wounded,  assisted  the  other  wounded  members  of  his 
crew  to  the  first-aid  station. 

First  lieutenant,  167th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Although  sick.  Lieutenant  Beattie  refused  to  relinquish  his  command  and  with 
utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  danger  led  his  platoon  in  the  attack  under 
heavy  enemy  machine-gun,  artillery,  and  rifle  fire,  which  resulted  in  the 
capture  of  tlie  objective,  thereby  setting  an  example  to  his  men  of  coolness, 
outstanding  courage,  and  devotion  to  duty.  During  the  performance  of 
this  brave  act  Lieutenant  Beattie  was  struck  by  enemy  shell  fire  and  made 
the  supreme  sacrifice. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  Albert  M.  Beattie. 

Lieutenant  colonel,  320th  Field  Artillery,  82d  Division. 

In  the  face  of  terrific  enemy  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  Lieutenant  Colonel 
Beere,  accompanied  by  another  officer,  voluntarily  made  his  way  forward 
and  beyond  the  advanced  infantry  lines  for  a  distance  of  several  hundred 
yards.  Upon  reaching  the  advanced  infantry  lines  they  separated,  but  first 
made  plans  so  that  the  information  obtained  might  be  carried  hack  by  either 
officer.  After  a  very  thorough  reconnaissance  they  located  the  enemy  positions 
and  strong  points  which  were  holding  up  the  advance.  They  then  success- 
fully returned  to  our  lines  and  communicated  the  information  to  the  nearest 
artillery,  which  concentrated  fire  upon  the  critical  points  and  silenced  the 
enemy  "resistance,  thereby  permitting  the  Infantry  to  resume  the  advance. 

First  lieutenant,  119th  Infantry,  30th  Division. 

During  the  operations  against  the  Hindenburg  Line  Lieutenant  Bellamy  was 
in  command  of  Company  H,  119th  Infantry,  and  was  shortly  the  only  officer 
present.  Leading  his  company  in  the  advance  Lieutenant  Bellamy  assisted 
the  attack  on  his  left.  Before  the  objective  was  reached,  the  assaulting  com- 
pany in  his  front  lost  all  its  officers  and  suffored  many  casualties.  Discovering 
the  situation  Lieutenant  Bellamy  moved  forward,  took  command  of  the 
assaulting  wave,  and  led  it  against  the  enemy  position,  knowing  it  to  be 
strongly  entrenched.  In  the  face  of  intense  enemy  artillery,  machine-gun, 
rifle,  and  grenade  fire  he  continued  the  advance,  reached  the  machine-gun 
positions,  strong  points  and  trenches,  and  captured  them  in  hand-to-hand 
combat.  Although  wounded,  Lieutenant  Bellamy  remained  witli  his  com- 
pany, knowing  that  he  was  the  only  officer  present  in  that  section  of  the  line, 
leading  his  men  forward  to  their  objective. 

Sergeant,  Company  M,  26th  Infantry,  1st  Division. 

When  the  advance  of  his  company  was  held  up  by  direct  enemy  machine-gun 
and  artillery  fire.  Sergeant  Bilek  displayed  unusual  courage  and  leadership 
when,  without  orders  and  on  his  own  initiative,  he  skillfully  led  his  platoon 
to  a  position  on  the  flank  of  the  enemy.  He  then  launched  an  attack  which 
resulted  in  capturing  several  machine  guns  and  many  prisoners,  thereby 
enabling  his  company  to  continue  its  advance. 

Sergeant,  Company  G,  110th  Infantry,  28th  Division. 

Sergeant  Black  commanded  one  of  four  patrols  which  were  sent  out  to  attack 
and  drive  out  enemy  outposts  on  the  railroail  embankment  a  few  hundred 
yards  south  of  the  river.  As  they  advanced,  the  patrols  were  met  by  heavy 
enemy  machine-gun  and  rifle  grenade  fire  which  necessitated  the  withdrawal 
of  three  of  the  patrols.  Sergeant  Black  led  his  patrol  to  the  railroad,  drove 
out  the  enemy,  and  held  the  position  throughout  the  night  and  the  following 
day  until  ordered  to  retire,  although  repeatedly  attacked  by  the  enemy. 
During  the  operations  between  the  Vesle  and  Aisne  Itivers,  France,  Sept. 
7,  1918,  Sergeant  Black,  with  utter  disregard  of  his  own  personal  safety, 
directed  the  fire  of  his  platoon  unon  a  retreating  body  of  the  enemy,  and  while 
in  this  exposed  position  he  was  killed  in  action. 

Posthumously  awarded.   Medal  presented  to  sister,  Mrs.  Mary  Black  Andrews.

Sergeant,  Machine-Gun  Company,  363d  Infantry,  91st  Division. 

Sergeant  Black,  with  Lieut.  John  F.  Pahlke.  asked  for  and  received  permission 
to  go  forward  and  rout  out  some  enemy  snipers  who  were  annoying  the  com- 
pany. After  moving  forward  around  the  enemy's  flank  and  killing  the  snipers , 
they  decided  to  flank  some  enemy  machine  gunners  who  were  holding  up  the 
advance  of  the  regiment.  Upon  reaching  the  enemy  machine-gun  line  they 
captured  the  flank  gun  with  its  crew.  The  prisoners  were  then  made  to 
direct  them  to  the  next  gun.  This  was  repeated,  gun  after  gun,  until  more 
than  80  prisoners  were  captured  with  their  guns.  A  fter  turning  their  prisoners 
over  to  an  officer  of  their  regiment,  both  Sergeant  Black  and  Lieutenant  Pahlke 
turned  some  of  the  enemy  guns  on  the  retreating  enemy.  The  success  attained 
by  Sergeant  Black  and  his  companion,  by  their  remarkable  feat,  was  so  great 
as  to  demoralize  completely  the  enemy  resistance  and  made  it  possible  for  tha 
regiment  to  resume  the  advance  with  but  little  opposition. 

Sergeant,  Company  A,  102d  Infantry,  26th  Division. 

When  the  advance  of  his  company  was  temporarily  halted  by  machine-gun  fire 
from  an  enemy  nest,  Sergeant  Boiko  volunteered  to  flank  the  nest  and  put  the 
guns  out  of  action.  Although  under  intense  fire,  Sergeant  Boiko,  utterly 
disregarding  his  own  personal  danger,  crawled  out  from  the  lines  and  worked 
his  way  to  a  favorable  position  where  enfilade  fire  could  be  delivered  and  with 
his  pistol  silenced  the  guns,  capturing  them  and  a  portion  of  the  enemy  guH' 
crews,  thus  enabling  his  company  to  make  a  further  advance. 

Private,  Company  C,  9th  Field  Signal  Battalion,  5th  Division. 

On  Nov.  2,  1918,  Private  Bolton  advanced  with  the  assaulting  company  of  the 
60th  Infantry  into  Chery-le-Petit  and,  under  intense  enemy  artillery  and 
machine-gun  fire,  laid  telephone  lines,  thus  establishing  communication 
between  the  forward  elements  and  the  regimental  headquarters.  On  Nov.  5, 
1918,  Private  Bolton  extended  the  telephone  lines  across  the  Meuse  River  and 
to  the  bank  of  the  canal.  Undeterred  by  the  fact  that  the  bridge  across  the 
canal  was  destroyed  by  enemy  shell  fire,  Private  Bolton  under  heavy  enemy 
fire  swam  the  canal  with  telephone  equipment  on  his  back  and  established 
communication  between  the  advancing  units  of  the  regiment  and  the  regi- 
mental headquarters.  By  his  conspicuous  bravery  and  utter  disregard  of 
personal  safety  in  going  forward  as  one  of  the  first  of  the  attacking  forces. 
Private  Bolton  contributed  largely  to  the  success  of  the  engagement.

While  advancing  under  intense  machine-gun  fire.  Sergeant  Bradford  was 
severely  wounded  in  the  jaw  but  refused  to  be  evacuated  or  to  have  his 
wounds  dressed.  Observing  that  the  company  was  moving  to  a  forward 
position,  he  motioned  the  men  of  his  platoon  to  follow  him  and  continued 
leading  them  until  his  weakened  condition  made  it  impossible  for  him  to 
advanc3  farther. 

Private,  Company  H,  168th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

For  extraorJmary  heroism  in  action  during  an  enemy  raid  on  G.  C.  #11,  C.  R.

of  the  enemy,  intent  on  securing  prisoners  and,  supported  by  hand  grenades 
and  rifle  fire,  penetrated  our  lines,  Private  Brant  and  3  companions  displayed 
exceptional  bravery  and  fortitude  when  they  fought  them  hand-to-hand  and 
succeeded  in  killing  1  and  dispersing  the  remainder  of  this  superior  force. 

Second  lieutenant.  Company  A,  167th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Lieutenant  Breeding  had  been  out  with  a  patrol  into  the  enemy's  lines  when  it 
was  discovered  that  one  member  of  the  patrol  was  mi.ssing.  Lieutenant 
Breeding  with  another  officer  volunteered  to  return  into  the  enemy  lines  in 
search  of  the  missing  man,  thereby  setting  an  example  of  determination, 
energy,  and  bravery.  They  proceeded  on  their  mission  and,  while  looking 
for  the  missing  man,  discovered  one  of  the  enemy  lurking  in  the  bushes,  where- 
upon Lieutenant  Breeding  shot  and  killed  him,  bringing  the  body  into  the 
American  lines.  Valuable  information  was  obtained  which  aided  materially 
in  the  later  action  of  the  command.  Lieutenant  Breeding  was  killed  in  action 
on  July  28,  1918.

ganized his  company  and  established  a  line  of  resistance  which  withstood 
continuous  attacks  at  a  critical  point  in  the  line.  Despite  his  wounds,  he

Second  lieutenant.  Company  I,  363  Infantry,  91st  Division. 

Lieutenant  Brocopp,  with  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety,  repeatedly 
led  his  platoon  forward  in  the  face  of  severe  enemy  fire.  During  the  engage  - 
ment  his  command  captured  two  guns  of  an  enemy  field  artillery  battery. 
His  coolness,  courage,  and  bravery  were  a  great  inspiration  to  his  men  during 
the  action.  After  the  engagement  he  rendered  valuable  assistance  to  his 
company  commander  in  organizing  the  company  position  for  the  night. 

Wagoner,  Supply  Company,  166th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

In  response  to  a  caii  from  the  attacking  battalion  for  ammunition,  Wagoner 
Brooks  voluntarily  drove  a  combat  wagon  in  broad  daylight  under  intense 
artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  into  the  front-line  position  near  Fere-en- 
Tardenois,  and  delivered  the  ammunition  required  by  his  comrades  on  the 
front . 

Private,  first  class.  Company  F,  102d  Infantry,  26th  Division. 

Private  Brown  was  a  member  of  a  working  party  detailed  to  string  barbed  wire 
well  out  in  front  of  the  advance  post.  His  party  encountered  a  violent  enemy 
barrage  which  protected  enemy  assault  troops.  Private  Broun  helped  to 
fight  otf  the  enemy,  and  with  rare  coolne.&lt;;s  and  daring  continued  to  pass  back 
and  forth  through  the  hostile  barrage  collecting  our  men  and  assisting  in  the 
reorganization  of  the  party. 

Captain,  Company  E,  SOOth  Infantry,  90th  Division. 

While  advancing  through  a  violent  counterbarrage,  a  shell  struck  in  the  midst 
of  the  company  headquarters  group,  practically  annihilating  it  and  wounding 
Captain  Broun  to  such  an  extent  that  he  lay  for  a  time  unconscious.  When 
revived  ho  effected  a  reorganization  of  his  company  and  continued  the  ad- 
vance. Shortly  thereafter  he  was  wounded  a  second  time  but  refused  to  be 
evacuated,  remaining  with  his  command  through  2  days  and  nights  of  severe 
fighting.  The  personal  example  of  fearlessness  displayed  by  Captain  Broun 
inspired  his  men  and  those  of  neighboring  units  and  contributed  materially 
to  the  success  of  the  operations. 

Private,  first  class.  Company  C,  117th  Infantry,  30th  Division. 

Private  Brown  exhibited  unusual  courage  and  bravery  when  he  and  three 
companions,  though  warned  of  the  great  danger,  accompanied  their  com- 
manding officer  across  an  exposed  area  to  the  flank  of  an  enemy  machine-gun 
nest  in  order  to  draw  the  fire  of  the  machine  guns  from  the  exposed  platoons 
of  their  company,  which  were  suffering  heavy  casualties.  One  of  his  com- 
panions was  killed  and  another  fatally  wounded;  nevertheless,  the  ruse  was 
successful  and  permitted  other  men  of  the  company  to  advance  from  the  oppo- 
site flank  and  capture  the  machine-gun  nests. 

Corporal,  Company  H,  168th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

For  extraordinary  heroism  in  action  during  an  enemy  raid  on  O.  C.  #11,  C.  R. 
Chamois  sector,  France,  on  the  night  of  May  17-18,  1918.  When  about  10  of 
the  enemy,  intent  on  securing  prisoners  and  supported  by  hand  grenades  and 
rifle  fire,  penetrated  our  lines,  Corporal  Bruner  and  three  companions  dis- 
played exceptional  bravery  and  fortitude  when  they  fought  thtm  hand-to- 
hand  and  succeeded  in  killing  1  and  dispersing  the  remainder  of  this  superior 
force.  In  the  performance  of  this  act  Corporal  Bruner  was  wounded  by  an 
exploding  hand  grenade. 

Second  lieutenant,  18th  Field  Artillery,  3d  Division. 

During  heavy  shelling  by  the  enemy  Lieutenant  Carry  voluntarily  went  for- 
ward into  a  shell-swept  area  in  front  of  the  battery  position  to  assist  in  bringing 
back  a  severely  woimded  man.  Lieutenant  Carry,  assisted  by  another  oflicer 
and  an  enlisted  man,  carried  the  wounded  man  under  heavy  fire  to  a  place  of 
comparative  safety,  from  where  he  was  evacuated  to  the  rear.  The  utter  dis- 
regard for  his  own  personal  safety  displayed  by  Lieutenant  Carry  was  an 
inspiration  to  the  entire  command. 

Second  lieutenant.  Company  D,  165th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

With  great  skill  and  daring  Lieutenant  Cassidy  led  a  patrol  at  night  into  the 
enemy's  lines.  The  patrol  surprised  and  captured  an  entire  outpost,  killing 
two  and  bringing  in  four  prisoners.  His  undaunted  courage  and  leadership 
proved  an  inspiration  to  his  men  and  aided  materially  in  the  successful  accom- 
plishment of  his  mission.

arrived  and  was  given  the  necessary  orders  and  instructions.  By  his  bravery, 
coolness  under  fire,  and  devotion  to  duty.  Sergeant  Castura  was  a  great  inspira- 
tion to  the  men  of  his  command.

When  it  became  necessary  to  lay  a  line  across  a  shell-swept  area  to  the  battery's 
forward  observation  post,  Sergeant  Clark  undertook  the  task  alone  rather  than 
expose  other  men  of  the  detail  to  the  e.\treme  danger.  With  utter  disregard 
for  his  own  personal  danger,  he  went  forward  under  heavy  enemy  shell  fire 
and  put  through  and  repaired  the  line  which  was  cut  several  times  by  enemy 
fire,  and  thus  enabled  the  continuance  of  the  firing  of  the  guns  of  his  own 
organization.  His  outstanding  gallantry  under  heavy  enemy  fire  and  his 
courage  and  coolness  were  an  inspiration  to  the  men  of  his  detail. 

Private,  Sanitary  Detachment,  107th  Infantry,  27th  Division. 

Private  Clarke  displayed  great  gallantry  and  bravery  in  the  treatment  and 
evacuation  of  the  wounded.  While  advancing  with  his  company  to  the  for- 
ward unit  of  his  command,  a  most  exposed  position,  he  saw  a  British  tank 
emerge  from  a  smoke  screen,  heading  straight  for  a  small  hole  in  which  a 
group  of  14  wounded  men  were  seeking  shelter.  Private  Clarke  endeavored 
to  attract  the  attention  of  the  crew  of  the  tank  but  failing  to  do  so  he  disre- 
garded his  own  personal  danger  by  assisting  the  walking  wounded  and  drag- 
ging the  more  seriously  wounded  men  to  a  place  of  safety.  His  gallantry 
and  fearlessness  on  this  occasion  undoubtedly  saved  the  lives  of  many  of 
these  men. 

Private,  first  class.  Company  A,  117th  Train  Headquarters  and  Military  Police, 
42d  Division. 

For  extraordinary  heroism  in  action  at  St.  Hilaire-au-Temple,  France,  on  the 
night  of  July  21,  1918.  While  on  duty  as  a  town  patrol  during  an  enemy  aerial 
bombardment.  Private  Clearij,  disregarding  his  own  danger,  remained"  at  bis 
post  and  continued  to  make  his  rounds  to  see  that  all  other  troops  were  under

sacrifice.

wounded  comrades.

tacked a  nest  of  enemy  machine  guns,  forcing  the  enemy  to  retire  with  heavy 
losses.  He  held  the  position  for  3  hour.^  when,  owing  to  his  party  being  re- 
duced by  casualties  to  5  men,  he  was  compelled  to  withdraw.

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  sister,  Mrs.  Pearl  E.  Gibney. 

Private,  Company  D,  127th  Infantry,  32d  Division. 

Private  Dewitz  was  a  member  of  a  party  who  assisted  in  attacking  a  machine-gun 
ne.st  held  by  approximately  70  Germans.  Under  terrific  fire  from  the  enemy 
who  laid  down  an  artillery  barrage  upon  their  position,  they  concentrated 
their  rifle  fire  so  efi'ectively  that  32  Germans  surrendered  within  an  hour. 
After  the  prisoners  had  been  brought  in.  Private  Deuitz,  with  another  soldier, 
using  a  captured  (Jerman  gun,  established  a  machine-gun  position  under 
heavy  fire  from  both  artillery  and  machine  guns  and  delivered  fire  upon 
enamy  positions. 

Sergeant,  Company  C,  109th  Infantry,  28th  Division. 

When  the  advance  of  his  company  was  halted  by  machine-gun  fire  from  an 
enemy  nest,  Sergeant  Doyle,  utterly  disregarding  his  own  personal  danger, 
volunteered  to  locate  definitely,  and  silence,  if  possible,  the  destructive  fire. 
With  great  skill  and  bravery  he  advanced  about  500  yards  beyond  our  lines 
and  assisted  in  silencing  the  machine  guns  and  capturing  several  prisoners. 
This  courageous  action  of  Sergeant  Doyle  greatly  inspired  his  comrades  and 
enabled  his  company  to  make  a  further  advance. 

Captain,  French  Army,  senior  liaison  officer,  attached  to  the  84th  Infantry 
Brigade,  42d  Division. 

When  communication  service  had  been  broken  between  the  brigade  commander 
and  the  two  front-line  battalions  of  his  brigade,  due  to  the  enemy's  terrific  fire 
which  made  it  impossible  to  maintain  either  Signal  Corps  installations  or 
runner  service,  Captain  Drouhin  at  the  critical  moment  volunteered  to  make 
his  way  across  a  gap  between  the  two  battalions  in  order  to  carry  orders  to  the 
commanding  officers  thereof.  His  services  on  this  occasion  cannot  be  over- 
estimated and  were  accomplished  voluntarily  and  only  at  the  most  deadly 
risk  to  himself. 

Corporal,  Company  D,  362d  Infantry,  91st  Division. 

Corporal  Diigat,  in  company  with  two  other  soldiers,  while  advancing  well  to 
the  front  of  the  company  as  scouts,  encountered  eight  enemy  machine  guns 
and  four  snipers,  which  by  brave  action  and  good  judgment  weie  put  out  of 
action  and  the  enemy  killed  or  captured.  On  Oct.  1,  1918,  while  on  duty  with 
his  company  Corporal  Dugal  made  the  supreme  sacrifice. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  brother,  Cornelius  E.  Dugat. 

Corporal,  Company  D,  308th  Infantry,  77th  Division. 

After  several  attempts  had  been  made  by  large  groups  to  take  a  small  position 
in  the  woods  north  of  our  forces,  Corporal  Durr  volunteered  and  was  given 
14  men  with  instructions  to  reach  and  hold  the  position  until  relieved.  He 
made  an  attempt  to  perform  this  di.ty  and  within  a  short  time  5  of  his  men 
were  killed  and  5  wounded.  He  nevertheless  continued  with  the  4  remaining 
men  in  spite  of  heavy  enemy  resistance  and  succeeded  in  reaching  the  objective 
holding  the  position  gained  for  48  hours.  He  then  rejv  rted  to  his  com- 
manding officer  an&lt;l  returned  to  the  position  with  assurance  that  reinforce- 
ments would  be  furnished.  He  held  the  position  throughout  the  night  when 
he  again  encountered  intense  enemy  machine-gun  and  shell  fire  that  killed 
the  remaining  4  members  of  his  party.  Corporal  Durr's  display  of  extraor- 
dinary heroism  by  holding  his  position  under  trying  conditions  was  of  great 
value  to  his  organization. 

Corporal  (acting  sergeant).  Company  Q,  32Sth  Infantry,  82d  Division. 

When  in  command  of  a  i)arty  of  17  men  Serpennt  Enrty  flanked  a  German  bat- 
talion. Upon  being  suddenly  confronted  by  about  2(iU  of  the  enemy,  Ser- 
geant Enrly  decided  to  attack  despite  the  disparity  of  numbers.  By  his 
quick  decision  and  excellent  leadership  Sergeant  ?MTly  effected  a  successful 
surprise  attack,  which  he  led  and  commanded  until  severely  wounded  by 
enemy  machine-gun  fire.  The  conspicuous  gallantry  and  outstanding  leader- 
ship on  the  part  of  Sergeant  Enrly  so  inspired  the  remainder  of  his  small 
command  that  it  continued  the  attack  until  the  enemy  battalion  was  either 
killed  or  taken  prisoner. 

Private,  Company  H,  16Sth  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

For  extraordinary  heroism  in  action  during  an  enemy  raid  on  G.  C.  #11,  C.  R.

of  the  enemy,  intent  on  securing  prisoners  and  supported  by  hand  grenades 
and  rifle  fire,  penetrated  our  lines.  Private  Knlon  and  3  companions  displayed 
exceptional  bravery  and  fortitude  when  they  fought  them  hand-to-hand  and 
succeeded  in  killing  1  and  dispersing  the  remainder  of  this  superior  force.  In 
the  performance  of  this  act.  Private  Eaton  was  instantly  killed. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  mother,  Mrs.  Addie  Eaton. 

Corporal,  Company  D,  303d  Engineers,  78th  Division. 

With  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety  and  in  the  face  of  intense  enemy 
shell  fire.  Corporal  Eddl  voluntarily  crossed  No  Man's  Land  during  a 
heavy  enemy  barrage  and  brought  back  three  members  of  his  command  who 
were  wounded  and  helpless  in  front  of  the  trenches,  thereby  saving  the  lives 
of  these  men  and  setting  an  example  of  S/oldierly  courage  and  determination 
to  the  members  of  his  organization.

During  the  construction  of  a  floating  footbridge  across  the  Meuso  River  the 
engineers  were  subjected  to  violent  machine-gun  and  small-arms  fire  at  short 
range.  Private  Eller  was  undismayed  by  the  enemy's  fire  and  the  fact  that 
most  of  the  men  around  him  had  fallen.  When  the  bridge  broke,  he  lashed 
it  together  and  then  despite  his  drenched  condition  from  the  icy  water  volun- 
teered as  bridgehead  guard  on  the  enemy's  side  of  the  river. 

Private,  Company  I,  28th  Infantry,  1st  Division. 

During  the  attack  when  the  leaders  of  the  other  two  platoons  of  his  company 
had  become  casualties,  Private  Ervin  displayed  marked  courage  and  leader- 
ship in  assisting  his  platoon  commander  in  reorganizing  those  platoons  and 
in  fearlessly  leading  one  of  the  platoons  through  heavy  enemy  artillery  and 
machine-gun  fire  to  the  capture  of  the  objective.  Upon  arriving  at  the 
objective  they  were  swept  by  terrific  fire  from  an  enemy  machine-gun  nest 
which  inflicted  heavy  casualties.  Private  Ervin  called  for  volunteers  and  led 
them  in  the  face  of  direct  fire  in  a  charge  upon  the  machine-gun  nest  until  he 
fell  severely  wounded  in  front  of  the  gun  pit;  but  two  members  of  the  party 
reached  the  machine  gun,  killed  the  crew,  and  seized  the  gun.  After  being 
wounded  he  crawled  back  to  the  firing  line  and  organized  an  automatic-rifle 
post  and  refused  ro  be  evacuated  until  danger  of  counterattack  had  passed. 
Private  Ervin's  gallant  conduct  in  this  action  exemplified  exceptional  courage 
and  leadership  and  was  an  inspiration  to  his  comrades. 

Private,  Company  C,  316th  Infantry,  79th  Division. 

Private  Falacchi  with  2  other  men  occupied  a  small  shell  hole  on  the  front  line, 
there  being  no  other  troops  near  except  15  men  who  occupied  a  large  shell  hole 
a  few  yards  to  their  right.  The  morning  was  foggy  and  about  60  Germans 
crept  through  the  lines,  outflanked  the  men  in  the  large  shell  hole,  disarmed 
them,  and  ordered  tliem  to  stand  fast.  Private  Falacchi  and  his  2  companions 
immediately  opened  rapid  fire,  killing  6  of  the  Germans  and  completely 
routing  the  others,  thereby  rescuing  their  15  comrades  from  the  hands  of  the 
enemy. 

Corporal,  117th  Trench  Mortar  Battery,  42d  Division. 

Corporal  Fanning  was  in  charge  of  a  trench  mortar  emplacement  which  was 
firing  a  barrage  against  an  enemy  raid.  One  of  the  bombs  from  the  mortar 
fell  on  the  side  of  the  emplacement  and  was  rolling  into  the  emplacement  where 
the  gun  crew  of  four  other  men  were  located.  Corporal  Fanning  rushed  across 
the  emplacement,  seized  the  bomb  as  it  was  rolling,  and  unscrewed  the  fuze, 
thereby  exposing  himself  to  great  personal  danger  and  by  his  heroic  action 
saving  the  lives  of  his  comrades  in  the  emplacement. 

First  lieutenant,  Company  C,  114th  Machine-Gun  Battalion,  30th  Division. 

While  in  charge  of  a  platoon  of  his  company,  which  was  manning  the  inter- 
mediate guns  supporting  the  advancing  tnf  uitry  his  platoon  was  caught  in 
the  enemy's  countorbarrage  and  many  men  became  casualties.  Lieutenant 
Farris  reorganized  the  remaining  men  into  s&lt;iuads,  collecting  stragglers,  and 
was  able  to  push  ahead  with  all  guns  and  reached  the  objective  on  schedule 
time  despite  the  heavy  niaehine-gun  and  trench-mortar  fire  of  the  enemy. 
After  reaching  the  objective  he  olTered  his  services  to  the  Infantry  commander 
who  had  him  advance  four  of  his  machine  guns  to  protect  his  right  flank, 
enabling  the  withdrawal  of  Lewis  guns  on  that  flank  for  use  elsewhere.  His 
able  leadership  and  initiative  contributed  largely  to  the  success  of  the  opera- 
tion. 

Second  lieutenant,  Company  B,  103d  Machinc-Gun  Battalion,  2rith  Division. 

Before  diylight  on  the  morning  of  July  18,  1918,  when  his  command  arrived  at 
the  jumping  ofli  position,  Lieutenant  Fenton  discovered  that  one  platoon  was 
missing.  Not  desiring  to  send  his  runner  back  through  the  heavy  enemy 
biirrago,  Lieutenant  Ferton  turned  his  command  over  to  another  oflicer  and 
with  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety  went  to  locate  the  missing 
platoon.  Although  knocked  down  and  wounded  by  a  bursting  shell  he 
found  the  platoon  and  guided  it  around  the  barrage  to  its  position.  .Addi- 
tional ammunition  then  being  needed  by  his  organization  Lieutenant  fenton 
went  through  enemy  shell  fire  a  second  time,  arranged  for  ammunition, 
returned  and  in  spite  of  his  wounds  advanced  with  his  command,  refusing  to 
l)e  evacuated  until  it  was  relieved  3  days  later. 

(.^orporal,  Company  F,  165th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

Although  suffering  from  a  wound  received  earlier  in  the  day,  Corporal  Finnegan 
exposed  himself  to  direct  enemy  fire  while  directing  the  (lefonse  of  his  position 
during  a  stubborn  enemy  attack.  After  liaving  been  rendered  unconscious 
by  an  enemy  stick  grenade  he  was  carried  to  the  dressing  station.  When  he 
regained  consciousness  several  hours  later  he  insisted  upon  donning  his 
equipment  and  returning  to  his  organization  where  he  continued  to  serve 
with  great  bravery  until  the  enemy  was  repulsed.

Private,  Company  D,  166th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Private  Fischer,  with  Private  Charles  C.  Landon,  volunteered  to  rescue  another 
soldier  who  had  been  severely  wounded  during  the  heavy  enemy  bombard- 
ment. WMth  a  total  disregard  for  their  own  personal  safety  they  courageously 
went  forward  and  while  attemiiting  to  reach  the  wounded  soldier,  Private 
Landon  was  hit  by  a  shell  and  died  a  few  minutes  later.  Private  Fischer 
was  wounded  by  shell  fire  but  returned  to  the  first-aid  station  for  assistance 
to  bring  in  the  wounded  soldier,  refusing  to  have  his  own  wound  dressed  until 
his  mission  had  been  accomplished.

Sergeant,  first  cla.ss,  Company  C,  304th  Field  Signal  Battalion,  79th  Division. 

During  this  operation  our  telegraph  and  telephone  lines  were  being  constantlj- 
cut  by  enemy  artillery  fire.  With  utter  disregard  of  his  own  personal  danger 
Sergeant  Fisher  went  out  many  times,  night  and  day,  in  an  area  that  was 
covered  with  enemy  artillery  fire,  including  much  gas,  to  repair  breaks  in  the 
wires.  By  his  example  of  personal  bravery  Sergeant  Fisher  encouraged  the 
men  of  his  platoon  to  assist  in  maintaining  the  lines  of  communication,  thus 
enabling  messages  of  important  military  value  to  be  transmitted  in  times  of 
greatest  need. 

Sergeant,  Company  A,  11th  Infantry,  5th  Division. 

Commanding  a  platoon  in  the  attack  on  the  town  of  Jametz,  France,  and  finding 
the  attack  held  up  by  the  enemy  holding  a  bridge  with  machine  guns,  Sergeant 
FitzpntricI;  gallantly  charged  the  bridge  with  his  platoon  and  carried  it,  there- 
by allowing  those  in  the  rear  to  come  forward.  After  capturing  the  bridge  he 
immediately  reorganized  his  platoon  and,  charging  into  the  town,  captured 
five  prisoners  and  two  machine  guns. 

Captain,  167th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Captain  Flowers,  after  his  battalion  commander  v.-as  wounded  and  evacuated 
early  in  the  attack,  took  command  and  reorganized  the  remnants  of  the  2d 
and  3d  Battalions,  leading  them  to  a  successful  final  attack.  Captain  Flowers, 
disregarding  his  own  danger,  made  a  personal  reconnaissance  alone  and 
ascertained  that  the  enemy  was  preparing  for  a  counterattack.  Then  leading 
his  battalion  in  a  final  assault  the  command  repulsed  the  counterattack  and 
captured  or  killed  practically  the  entire  force  of  the  enemy.  Hi.s  disregard  for 
his  own  personal  safety,  coolness,  and  good  judgment  were  an  inspiration  to 
his  men  and  encouraged  them  to  continue  to  their  final  objective. 

Second  lieutenant,  26th  Infantry,  1st  Division. 

Throughout  the  engagement  of  Oct.  4-13,  1918,  Lieutenant  Forster  displayed 
exceptional  coolness  and  bravery  under  artillery,  machine-gun,  and  rifle  fire, 
directing  the  fire  of  his  37-mm  guns,  thereby  rendering  invaluable  assistance 
to  his  battalion  commander  by  this  action  and  in  establishing  liaison  and  ob- 
taining important  information. 

Private,  Company  G,  115th  Infantry,  29th  Division. 

Upon  learning  that  a  small  party  had  been  ambushed  by  three  enemy  machine- 
gun  nests  and  one  soldier  killed  and  an  officer  severely  wounded,  Private  Fox 
voluntarily  accompanied  an  ofl^icer  to  within  50  yards  of  the  machine-gun 
nests,  in  the  face  of  heavy  enemy  machine-gun  fire,  and  assisted  in  carrying 
the  wounded  officer  to  safety. 

Sergeant,  Companj'  D,  110th  Infantry,  28th  Division. 

After  the  enemy  had  been  driven  back  from  his  position,  and  the  new  line  was 
being  organized  by  the  1st  battalion,  a  gap  occurred  on  the  right,  toward 
which  the  enemy  made  a  determined  counterattack.  Sergeant  Fuller,  with 
utter  disregard  of  his  own  personal  danger  and  on  his  own  initiative,  assumed 
coinm.and  of  a  platoon  and  rushed  it  into  the  gap  in  the  line,  where  under 
severe  enemy  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  it  was  able  successfully  to  repulse 
the  enemy  and  break  up  the  counterattack. 

Second  lieutenant,  7th  Field  Artillery,  1st  Division. 

While  the  position  of  Battery  \,  7th  Field  Artillery,  was  being  transferred  to  a 
new  position  on  the  afternoon  of  May  18,  1918,  the  enemy  opened  fire  on  the 
old  position  where  a  few  men  remained  on  duty.  Observing  that  Corporal 
John  G.  Flynt,  one  of  these  men,  had  been  severely  wounded.  Lieutenant 
Garnsey,  with  entire  disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety,  rushed  forward 
and  carried  the  wounded  corporal  to  a  place  of  safety. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  Cyrus  Garnsey,  Jr. 

Second  lieutenant,  28th  Infantry,  1st  Division. 

Lieutenant  Garrett  displayed  great  courage  and  self-sacrifice  during  the  4  days' 
battle  south  of  Soissons,  conducting  his  platoon  with  calmness  and  good  judg- 
ment, especially  on  July  19,  I'.US,  when  he  aided  in  keeping  his  company 
together  when  large  shells  struck  among  the  men,  personally  supervising  the 
care  of  the  wounded  and  getting  them  to  aid  stations,  with  utter  disregard  of 
his  own  safety,  while  subjected  to  heavy  enemy  artillery  and  machine-gun 
fire.  Lieutenant  Garrett  displayed  extraordinary  heroism  during  the  3  days 
previous  to  the  attack  on  Exermont,  France,  by  refusing  to  be  evacuated 
although  suffering  from  an  injury  to  his  foot,  remaining  at  his  post  until 
Oct^  4,  1918,  when  acting  as  liaison  officer,  he  with  5  men  was  suddenly 
confronted  by  20  Germans,  and  while  leading  the  attack  he  made  the  supreme 
sacrifice.  His  dauntless  courage  and  excellent  example  enabled  his  men  to 
take  the  Germans  as  prisoners.

many  branches  of  the  tree  being  cut,  but  his  observation  enabled  him  so  to 
organize  his  position  that  his  command  was  able  to  repulse  successfully  three 
enemy  counterattacks,  thereby  enabling  the  battalion  to  hold  the  Bois 
Frehaut.

under  severe  enemy  machine-gun  fire  until  he  was  severely  wounded.  Al- 
though the  seriousnes.s  of  his  wound  was  apparent,  he  nevertheless  continued

the  command  over  to  his  platoon  sergeant,  giving  him  all  possible  advice  in 
the  handling  of  the  situation.  Lieutenant  Hanford  showed  an  utter  dis- 
regard for  his  own  personal  safety,  which  was  an  inspiration  to  the  entire 
command.  The  wound  received  resulted  in  his  making  the  supreme  sacrifice 
on  August  1,  1918. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  H.  C.  Hanford.

First  lieutenant.  Headquarters  Troop,  80th  Division. 

On  the  night  of  Nov.  4,  1918,  when  the  left  of  the  division  was  counterattacked 
and  temporarily  driven  back  from  La  Thibaudine  Farm,  though  passed  by  the 
retiring  front  lines  and  under  no  obligation  to  remain  in  advance  of  them.  Lieu- 
tenant Hazlegrove  and  a  companion,  although  having  been  advised  to  with- 
draw, nevertheless  decided  to  remain  and  continued  throughout  the  night 
several  hundred  yards  beyond  the  divisional  outposts  in  an  exposed  locality 
well  known  to  the  enemy,  where  they  were  swept  by  cross  fire  of  machine  guns 
and  under  an  intensive  artillery  bombardment,  both  by  enemy  guns  and  by 
our  own  fire.  From  this  position  they  continued  to  render  reports  of  hostile 
movements  over  a  telephone  line,  maintained  at  the  greatest  personal  risk, 
to  such  good  purpose  that  the  attack  of  the  division,  renewed  on  the  morning 
of  Nov.  5,  1918,  was  a  complete  success.  To  this  voluntary  exposure  and  gal- 
lantry in  disregard  of  self  is  due  in  large  measure  the  success  of  the  division  in 
carrying  out  the  mission  assigned  to  it. 

Private,  Company  B,  165th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Private  Healy  voluntarily  left  the  shelter  of  the  trenches  and  went  forward  in 
broad  daylight  some  300  yards  under  direct  fire  of  enemy  machine  guns  and 
snipers  to  the  rescue  of  one  of  his  comrades  who.  while  within  100  yards  of  the 
enemy  lines,  had  been  mortally  wounded.  His  action  prevented  the  capture  of 
this  wounded  comrade  and  retrieved  important  enemy  maps  and  documents 
which  had  been  procured  from  enemy  casualties.  The  coolness,  courage,  and 
utter  disregard  of  personal  danger  displayed  by  Private  Healy  were  an  in- 
spiration to  his  comrades. 

Corporal,  Company  G,  355th  Infantry,  89th  Division. 

Corporal  Heath  volunteered  as  a  member  of  a  patrol  which  was  to  cross  the 
Meuse  River  by  swimming,  at  a  point  known  to  be  occupied  heavily  by 
enemy  detachments,  on  the  night  of  Nov.  9-10.  1918,  to  gain  information  of 
the  enemy  and  to  capture  prisoners.  When  the  members  of  the  patrol  reached 
the  middle  of  the  river,  they  were  discovered  by  the  enemy  who  immediately 
opened  a  .severe  fire  upon  them,  using  artillery,  machine  guns,  and  hand 
grenades.  The  heavy  fire  compelled  all  but  six  men  to  return.  With  utter 
disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety,  Corporal  Heath,  one  of  the  remaining 
members,  continued  on  the  mission,  succeeded  in  crossing  the  river,  and 
immediately  thereafter  made  the  supreme  sacrifice. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  John  Heath. 

Private,  Company  K,  16Sth  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

After  he  had  been  severely  wounded  in  his  left  hand  by  a  bursting  enemy  shell. 
Private  Heiden  found  a  comrade  who  was  wounded  so  severely  that  he  could 
not  travel  unaided.  Shells  were  bursting  around  the  spot  where  this  man 
lay  and  any  halt  there  subjected  the  man  to  grave  danger,  but  Private  Heiden 
went  to  the  aid  of  the  wounded  man.  carried  him  through  the  shell  fire,  despite 
the  suffering  to  himself,  and  delivered  his  comrade  to  the  litter  beaiers. 
Private  Heiden  had  then  suffered  such  loss  of  blood  that  it  was  necessary  for 
him  to  be  carried  by  litter  the  remainder  of  the  way  to  the  dressing  station, 
but  he  insisted  that  his  comrade  be  brought  in  first  and  given  attention. 
The  spirit  of  self-sacrifice  displayed  by  Private  Heiden  on  this  occasion  reflects 
great  credit  upon  himself  and  the  Army  in  which  he  served.

Henry  was  .sent  with  his  platoon  to  effect  contact  with  American  tioops 
advancing  from  the  south.  After  penetrating  the  enemy  lines  for  several 
kilometers  he  posted  the  members  of  his  platoon  in  strategic  positions  and, 
advancing  alone  in  absolute  darkness  through  enemy  machine-gun  infested 
territory  for  a  distance  of  two  kilometers,  captured  single-handed  a  German 
major  and  his  orderly  from  whom  valuable  information  was  obtained,  and

vicinity  of  the  position  occupied  by  a  platoon  of  his  company  with  utter 
disregard  of  his  own  personal  danger  and  assisted  a  badly  wounded  officer  of 
his  company  to  shelter.  Learning  that  this  advanced  platoon  was  in  need  of 
ammunition  and  water  Private  Higley  again  gallantly  made  his  way  to  the 
exposed  position  with  canteens  of  water  and  bandoleers  of  ammunition.

and  in  utter  disregard  of  his  own  safety.  He  killed  the  gunner  and  one  other, 
captured  the  gun,  and  took  10  prisoners.  He  was  constantly  under  heavy 
enemy  fire  yet  he  pressed  on  with  undaunted  courage  and  determination.

Ilnrton,  refusing  first  aid  and,  despite  the  fact  that  he  was  speechless  and 
suffering  intense  pain,  made  his  way  under  heavy  fire  to  the  nearest  dugout 
and  summoned  aid  for  his  wounded  comrades.  He  then  returned  to  his  sta- 
tion and  assisted  in  the  evacuation  of  the  wounded. 

Captain,  110th  Engineers,  35th  Division. 

At  a  critical  period  in  the  attack  when  the  assaulting  troops  were  compelled  to 
withdraw,  Captain  Hudson  advanced  his  battalion  of  engineers  from  a  sup- 
port position  in  the  face  of  heavy  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire,  and  established 
a  line  of  resistance.  Rallying  to  his  support  elem.ents  of  retiring  units  he 
repulsed  three  strong  counterattacks  and  held  the  line  until  reinforcements 
arrived.  Although  severely  wounded  early  in  the  operations,  Captaii^  Hud- 
son refused  to  be  evacuated,  and  remained  with  his  command  throughout  the 
entire  action. 

Corpora!,  Company  K,  lC7th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Although  painfully  wounded  in  the  chest.  Corporal  fiunt  refused  to  be  evacu- 
ated, and  remained  in  command  of  his  squad  through  2  days  of  hard  fighting

devotion  to  duty  to  the  other  members  of  the  command. 

First  sergeant,  Company  E,  127th  Infantry,  32d  Division. 

After  a  temporary  halt  had  been  made  by  his  organization  to  reorganize  the 
line,  and  the  advance  was  resumed,  an  attempt  v,-as  made  by  the  enemy  to 
outflank  the  company.  On  the  exposed  flank,  under  heavy  enemy  shell  fire. 
Sergeant  Jerzakoivski  coolly  and  heroically  organized  such  a  defense  that  the 
enemy  was  unable  to  outflank  his  company  which  was  able  to  reach  its  objec- 
tive.   Sergeant  Jerzakowski  was  later  killed  in  action  on  Oct.  5,  1918. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  mother,  Mrs.  J.  Jerzakowskl. 

Private,  first  class.  Company  F,  102d  Infantry,  26th  Division. 

Private  ^oft«.?o7!  was  a  member  of  a  working  party  detailed  to  string  barbed  wire 
well  out  in  front  of  the  advance  post.  His  party  encountered  a  violent  enemy 
barrage  which  protected  enemy  assault  troops.  Private  Johnson  helped  to 
fight  off  the  enemy,  and  with  rare  coolness  and  daring  continued  to  pass  back 
and  forth  through  the  hostile  barrage  collecting  our  men  and  assisting  in  the 
reorganization  of  the  party. 

Captain,  Company  D,  6th  Engineers,  3d  Division. 

Captain  Jones,  with  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety,  courageously 
led  his  men  during  this  period,  repeatedly  passing  from  trench  to  trench 
encouraging  his  men  while  under  enemy  machine-gun  and  rifle  fire.  On  Mar. 
30, 1918,  when  all  other  officers  of  his  company  became  casualties,  he  repeatedly 
exposed  himself  to  enemy  fire  while  going  from  the  front-line  trench  to  the 
strong  point,  about  100  yards  in  front,  in  order  to  keep  the  machine-guns  in 
action,  and  directing  the  reconstruction  of  the  trenches  after  the  enemy  bom- 
bardment had  partially  destroyed  them.  This  splendid  gallantry  and  leader- 
ship displayed  by  Captain  Jones,  and  his  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal 
safety,  were  a  great  inspiration  to  the  men  of  his  command. 

Private,  Company  C,  7th  Infantry,  3d  Division. 

Learning  that  his  company  commander  was  wounded  in  making  a  reconnais- 
sance. Private  Jones,  with  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  danser,  crawled 
about  100  yards  in  advance  of  the  front  line  under  intense  machine-gun  and 
rii'e  fire,  succeeded  in  reaching  the  wounded  officer,  and  moved  him  back 
within  the  front  line.  About  an  hour  later  Private  Jones,  although  wounded, 
carried  the  ofhcer  about  a  mile  to  the  first-aid  station  in  Cierges. 

Bugler,  Company  C,  110th  Infantry,  28th  Division. 

After  all  officers  of  his  company  had  been  killed,  wounded,  or  taken  prisoner, 
Busier  Jones,  while  endea\()ring  to  return  to  his  own  lines  after  having  been 
separated  with  a  detachment  from  his  company,  took  command  and  by  his 
excellent  judgment  led  the  detachment  forward,  frequently  exposing  himself 
to  enemy  fire,  and  leading  his  men  through  the  enemy  lines.  During  this 
action  Bugler  Jones  frequently  expased  himself  to  heavy  enemy  fire  and  on 
one  occasion  rendered  first  aid  to  a  severely  wounded  comrade,  thereby  saving 
his  life.  By  his  fearlessness  and  bravery  he  inspired  his  men  and  succeeded 
in  rejoining  his  regiment.

Corporal,  Company  I,  28th  Infantry,  1st  Division. 

Having  reached  the  first  objective,  the  platoon  was  temporarily  halted  by  heavy 
enemy  machine-gun  fire.  Corporal  Kunze,  hearing  cries  for  help  from  a 
wounded  comrade  who  lay  about  200  yards  in  front  of  the  platoon,  volun- 
tarily left  shelter,  went  out  under  heavy  machine-gun  fire,  and  succeeded  in 
bringing  him  to  a  place  of  safety.  In  so  doing.  Corporal  Kunze  was  severely 
wounded. 

Second  lieutenant,  301st  Battalion,  Tank  Corps. 

After  his  tank  had  been  put  out  of  action  and  set  on  fire  by  a  direct  hit  which 
killed  four  of  the  crew,  Lieutenant  Kusener,  utterly  disregarding  his  own 
personal  danger,  entered  the  blazing  tank  which  was  still  being  fired  on  and 
dragged  tlie  remainder  of  the  crew  to  safety.  Displaying  exceptional  coolness 
and  bravery  he  then  carried  two  members  of  the  crew,  who  had  been  seriously 
wounded,  to  a  dressing  station,  the  two  trips  being  made  over  ground  swept 
by  heavy  machine-gun  fire.

pany and  the  consolidation  of  the  positions  gained. 

Second  lieutenant.  Company  A,  11th  Machine-Cun  Battalion,  4th  Division.

porarily halted  by  direct  machine-gun  frontal  fire  and  by  strong  enfilading  fire 
from  an  enemy  machine-gun  nest  in  a  stone  tower  on  a  flank.  Lieutenant 
Ladue  voluntarily  made  a  reconnaissance  in  advance  of  the  front  line,  crawling 
from  shell  hole  to  shell  hole  under  heavy  enemy  fire.  He  then  gallantly  led 
two  squads  of  machine  guns  into  a  position  of  great  danger  about  100  yards  in 
front  of  the  firing  line,  and  by  his  extraordinary  coolness  and  tactical  skill  so 
directed  the  fire  of  his  guns  that  the  machine-gun  nest  was  silenced,  thereby 
permitting  the  advance  of  the  entire  firing  line.

tions of  the  Allied  Forces.  On  the  following  day  they  again  fiew  over  the 
enemy's  lines  and,  although  attacked  by  three  patrols  of  hostile  enemy  air-

sion and  returned  with  important  information.

men  and  fearlessly  went  forward  of  his  company's  front  line,  passing  through 
the  enemy  fire,  and  entered  a  wood  which  formed  the  enemy's  front  line. 
Discovering  a  series  of  five  hostile  machine-gun  positions  he  promptly  led  a 
rush  upon  them,  overcoming  and  subduing  the  three  center  positions.  Divid- 
ing his  party,  he,  with  one  man,  rushed  the  fifth  position,  capturing  it  together

While  commanding  the  1st  Battalion,  101st  Infantry,  Captain  McConnell 
encountered  concentrated  enemy  machine-gun  fire.  Without  regard  for  his 
own  personal  safety  he  reconnoitered  in  person  in  advance  of  his  own  lines,  and 
located  heavily  entrenched  machine-gun  positions.  Returning  he  so  directed 
the  Are  of  his  own  battalion  that  it  and  the  elements  on  the  right  and  left 
were  able  to  advance.  He  led  his  battalion  successfully  through  the  attack

lines  near  Lion-devant-Dun  and  Cote  St.  Germain,  to  report  on  the  attack 
of  the  61st  Infantry  which  was  engaged  in  an  attack  on  those  places.  He 
passed  from  front-line  units  to  the  command  post  of  the  61st  Infantry  through 
severe  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  in  order  to  telephone  the  results  of  his 
reconnaissance  to  his  brigade  commander.  While  passing  through  this  heavy 
fire  for  the  third  time,  he  was  severely  wounded  in  the  right  leg  by  a  fragment 
of  shell.  Though  his  leg  was  broken  and  he  was  unable  to  walk,  he  refused 
to  be  evacuated  until  assisted  to  a  telephone  where  he  made  his  report  to  his 
brigade  commander.  He  then  refused  to  have  his  wound  dressed  until 
others  had  received  treatment.

wounded,  were  alone  in  the  second  line  of  trenches.  Although  entirely  sur- 
rounded by  overwhelming  numbers  of  the  enemy,  Sergeant  Major  MacCormack 
gallantly  stood  his  ground,  firing  his  automatic  pistol  at  enemy  soldiers  until 
orderedto  surrender  by  his  wounded  commanding  officer.  After  being  cap- 
tured he  assisted  the  wounded  officer  to  the  enemy  line^  amid  terrific  artillery  fire 
from  his  own  lines.  Ordered  by  his  battalion  commander  to  leave  him  and  seek 
shelter,  he  refused,  remaining  under  constant  and  intense  American  fire  for 
3  hours  while  assisting  the  wounded  officer  to  a  place  of  safety.  Sergeant

From  the  south  side  of  the  Vcsle,  Lieutenant  A/c/Zitain  volunteered  to  accom- 
pany the  attacking  platoons  in  the  attack  on  the  town  of  Bazoches.  He 
crossed  the  river  under  heavy  enemy  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  and 
entered  the  town.  With  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  danger  Lieuten- 
ant Mcllunin  remained  at  the  front  caring  for  the  wounded,  without  shelter, 
under  direct  enemy  machine-gun  fire,  refusing  to  seek  shelter  until  after  all 
of  the  wounded  had  been  evacuated. 

Private,  Battery  F,  107th  Field  Artillery,  28th  Division. 

When  the  battery  to  which  Private  Mclnerne;/  belonged  was  changing  position 
at  midnight,  the  detail  carrying  the  supplies  was  struck  by  a  salvo  from  an 
enemy  artillery  barrage,  killing  two  and  wounding  several  men  of  the  detail. 
When  volunteers  were  called  for  by  the  commanding  ofTicer  to  remove  the 
dead  and  wounded,  Private  Mclntrney  was  one  of  the  first  to  volunteer. 
Private  Mclnerney  secured  a  team  and  wagon  and  placed  it  in  a  sheltered 
position.  He  then  made  three  successive  trips  across  an  enemy  shell-swept 
area  of  three  or  four  hundred  yards,  each  time  carrying  one  of  the  seriously 
wounded  men  to  the  wagon.  On  the  fourth  trip  he  led  five  of  the  less  seriously 
wounded  to  the  sheltered  position.  After  placing  the  eight  men  in  his  wagon 
he  drove  with  them  to  the  field  hospital  and  later  to  the  hospital  at  Cohan.

Lieutenant  Martin  led  his  platoon  under  heavy  artillery  and  machine-gun 
fire.  LTpon  reaching  the  bank  of  the  river  he  found  no  footbridge  across  the 
river.  He  leaped  into  the  river,  swam  across  it,  stretched  ropes,  and  impro- 
vised a  pontoon  structure.  After  reaching  the  north  bank  of  the  river  he 
observed  two  men  in  danger  of  being  carried  away  by  the  current,  going  to 
their  aid  and  rescuing  them  while  under  heavy  fire  from  the  enemy.  On 
Aug.  9,  1918,  when  his  company  commander  was  wounded,  he  fearle.ssly 
placed  himself  at  the  head  of  the  most  exposed  unit  and  led  it  forward  in  a

Private  Mason,  with  another  soldier,  on  two  occasions  ran  the  telephone  Uno 
between  the  battery  and  the  forward  observation  post,  passing  through  a 
heavy  enemy  barrage.  Having  accomplished  this  task  they  discovered  that 
the  wire  had  again  been  cut  and  proceeded  tc  repair  the  line.  While  so 
engaged  his  companion  was  wounded  and  died  almost  irstantly.  Private 
Mason  continued  to  repair  the  line  under  shell  fire,  thereby  enabling  the 
batteries  of  his  battalion  to  continue  firing  effectively. 

Private,  Company  D,  107th  Infantry,  27th  Division. 

Finding  the  advance  of  his  organization  held  up  by  a  withering  enemy  machine-

and  with  utter  disregard  of  their  own  personal  danger,  they  rushed  forward 
through  an  intense  machine-gun  fire  directly  upon  the  enemy  nest,  killing  2

During  the  attacks  in  the  Bois  d'Ormont,  Sergeant  Morrison,  who  had  become 
ga.ssed  due  to  the  fact  that  he  was  unable  to  wear  his  gas  mask,  displayed

to  reach  a  place  of  safety,  although  the  area  was  swept  by  heavy  machine-gun 
fire  and  was  extremely  dangerous  to  cross.  Sergeant  Naan,  realizing  the 
serious  condition  of  the  wounded  soldier,  and  with  utter  disregard  for  his 
own  personal  safety,  dashed  across  the  enfiladed  territory,  picked  up  the 
wounded  man,  and  carried  him  to  platoon  headquarters  where  he  admin- 
istered first  aid  and  later  carried  him  to  a  place  of  comparative  safety  behind

fog  and  rain  they  penetrated  30  kilometers  behind  the  enemy's  lines  and 
succeeded  in  surprising  an  important  movement  of  enemy  troops,  descended 
to  within  60  meters  of  the  ground  to  harass  the  enemy  troop  trains,  and  re- 
turned with  information  of  the  enemy  which  was  of  vital  importance  to  the 
operations  of  the  Allied  Forces.  On  the  following  day  they  again  flew  over 
the  enemy's  lines  and  although  attacked  by  three  patrols  of  hostile  enemy 
aircraft  and  by  antiaircraft  and  machine-gun  fire  they  accomplished  their 
mission  and  retm'ued  with  important  information. 

First  lieutenant.  Company  G,  168th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

2d  Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

During  this  attack  when  his  company  commander  had  been  severely  wounded 
and  the  second  officer  in  command  had  been  killed.  Lieutenant  Nelson, 
although  wounded  himself,  displayed  remarkable  courage  and  bravery  under 
heavy  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  when  he  assumed  command  of  the 
company  and  led  it  gallantly  forward,  remaining  in  command  until  the  attack 
was  over  and  his  company  relieved. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  brother,  C.  E.Nelson. 


First  lieutenant,  130th  Infantry,  33d  Division. 

Lieutenant  Nesbit  displayed  the  utmost  bravery  and  outstanding  courage  when, 
leading  a  daylight  patrol  of  7  men,  he  succeeded  in  penetrating  the  enemy 
lines  and  obtaining  valuable  information.  His  patrol  was  surrounded  by  an 
organized  group  of  about  20  of  the  enemy.  Despite  this  numerical  superi- 
ority, he  attacked  and  together  with  his  patrol  succeeded  in  killing  several 
of  the  enemy  and  capturing  1  prisoner.  Lieutenant  Nesbit  so  successfully 
maneuvered  his  patrol  under  heavy  machine-gun  and  rifle  fire  that  he  returned 
them  to  our  lines  without  suffering  a  casualty. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

Lieutenant  Nesbit  is  also  awarded  an  Oak-Leaf  Cluster  for  the  following  act  of 
extraordinary  heroism  in  action  near  Marcheville,  France,  Nov.  10,  1918. 

During  a  raid,  Lieutenant  Nesbit  in  command  of  a  platoon  in  the  first  wave 
encountered  terrific  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  from  the  front  and  flank. 
With  utter  disregard  of  his  personal  safety  he  rushed  forward  and  so  inspired 
his  men  that  they  were  able  to  clear  out  .several  machine-gun  nests  and  hold 
the  position  gained.  Lieutenant  Neshil's  courage  and  bravery  were  a  source 
of  inspiration  not  only  to  the  men  of  his  own  platoon  but  also  to  the  members 
of  other  companies  who  participated  in  the  raid. 

Private,  first  class.  Company  L,  307th  Infantry,  77th  Division. 

When  his  commanding  officer  had  been  severely  wounded  while  making  a 
personal  reconnaissance  of  the  front  lines,  Private  Nnzzolo,  together  with  a 
comrade,  voluntarily  left  shelter  and  went  out  under  heavy  machine-gun  fire 
to  assist  him.  Locating  him,  first  aid  was  administered  and  he  was  carried 
to  a  place  of  comparative  safety  from  which  he  could  be  evacuated. 

Private.  Company  E,  101th  Infantry,  26th  Division. 

Private  O'Brien  was  one  of  a  party  of  eight  soldiers  led  by  Lieut.  Charles  E. 
Nflson  in  an  attack  upon  a  machine-gun  emiUacement,  the  fire  of  which  was 
inflicting  sever(&gt;  losses  on  his  company.  In  the  advance  2  of  the  detachment 
were  killed  and  2  wounded  Init  Private  O'Brien  with  the  remaining  members 
of  the  party,  with  unlicsitating  gallantry  and  courage,  promptly  attacked, 
captured  a  machine  gun.  killed  5  of  the  enemy,  including  1  officer,  and  cap- 
tured 11  prisoners,  thereby  aiding  in  saving  his  company  from  further  severe 
losses. 

Captain,  28th  Infantry,  1st  Division. 

As  commanding  officer  of  Company  B,  28th  Infantry,  Captain  Olirer  led  hfs 
men  against  enemy  machine-gun  nests  which  were  preventing  the  advance 
of  his  regiment,  exposing  himself  fearlessly  to  h&lt;&gt;avy  shell  and  maehine-gun 
fire.  Unalterably  detiTn]iiie(l  to  reaeli  the  objective  to  which  he  was  ordered, 
Captain  Olirer  made  the  supreme  sacrifice  when  well  in  advance  of  his  com- 
pany. His  display  of  the  highest  courage  and  self-sacrifice  so  inspired  his  men 
that  they  were  victorious  in  one  of  the  most  desperate  phases  of  the  battle  of 
Soissons. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  brother,  Ernest  F.  Oliver.

Corporal,  Company  K,  12f&gt;th  Infantry,  32d  Division. 

After  the  advance  of  his  platoon  had  l.een  stopped  by  severe  fire  from  an  enemy 
machine-gun  nest,  Corporal  Paauwe.  assisted  by  another  soldier,  reorganized 
the  platoon  and  placed  it  under  cover.  Corporal  Paauwe  and  his  companion 
then  charged  the  enemy  machine-gun  nest  and  captured  it,  together  with  I 
officer  and  20  men. 

Second  lieutenant,  Philippine  Scouts,  serving  with  Machine-Gun  Company, 
363d  Infantry,  91st  Division. 

Lieutenant  Pahlke,  with  Sgt.  Lamar  Black,  asked  for  and  received  permission 
to  go  forward  and  rout  out  some  enemy  snipers  who  were  annoying  the  com- 
pany. After  moving  forward  around  the  enemy's  flank  and  killing  the 
snipers,  they  decided  to  flank  some  enemy  machine  gunners  who  were  holding 
up  the  advance  of  the  regiment.  Upon  reaching  the  enemy  machine-gun 
line  they  captured  the  flank  gun  with  its  crew.  The  prisoners  were  then 
made  to  direct  them  to  the  next  gim.  This  was  repeated,  gun  after  gun, 
until  more  than  SO  prisoners  were  captured  with  their  guns.  After  turning 
their  prisoners  over  to  an  ofRcer  of  their  regiment,  both  Lieutenant  Pahlke 
and  Sergeant  Black  turned  some  of  the  enemy  guns  on  the  retreating  enemy. 
The  success  attained  by  I^ieutenant  Pahlke  and  his  companion  by  their 
remarkable  feat,  was  so  great  as  to  demoralize  completely  the  enemy  resistance 
and  made  it  possible  for  the  regiment  to  resume  the  advance  with  but  little 
opposition. 

Private,  first  class.  Company  E,  112th  Infantry,  28th  Divisicn. 

When  the  advance  of  the  platoon  was  being  held  up  by  heavy  enemy  machine- 
gun  fire,  PrivEite  Pearman  left  his  place  of  comparative  safety  and  succeeded 
in  getting  close  enough  to  the  machine  gun  nest  to  use  a  hand"  grenade,  which 
proved  very  successful,  killing  four  and  wounding  one  of  the  enemy,  thereby 
breaking  up  the  nest  eonipletely  and  enabling  the  platoon  to  advance. 
In  the  performance  of  this  act  Private  Pearman  was  killed  instantly. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  Lee  Pearman,  Sr. 

Sergeant,  Company  C,  354th  Infantry,  89th  Division. 

Sergeant  Peck  was  advancing  with  his  company  across  an  open  field  when  an 
enemy  machine  gun  opened  fire  on  them  from  the  right  front.  The  attention 
of  the  platoon  commander  was  occupied  by  the  enemy  in  his  front  while  the 
enemy  on  the  right  fiank  was  directing  his  gun  upon  him.  Observing  that 
the  gunner  was  aiming  directly  at  Second  Lieut.  William  .^.  Ilolrombe,  Ser- 
geant Peck  threw  himself  against  the  lieutenant,  pushing  him  into  a  shell 
hole,  thereby  saving  his  life,  but  exposing  himself  to  the  fire  of  the  hostile 
gun  which  killed  him  instantly. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  son,  Roger  W.  Peck. 

Private,  first  class.  Company  K,  165th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

During  a  heavy  enemy  ijombardment,  when  a  high  explosive  ?hell  buried  four 
men  of  his  company  in  a  shell  hole,  wounding  three  and  killing  one  of  them, 
Private  Picka.-z,  with  complete  disregard  of  his  own  safety,  left  his  shelter, 
hurried  to  their  rescue  and.  under  a  heavy  barrage  of  enemy  machine-gun  and 
artillery  fire,  assisted  in  digging  the  men  out  with  his  hands  and  carrying 
them  to  a  place  of  safety. 

Private,  first  class.  Company  G,  355th  Infantry,  89th  Division. 

Private  Ponder  volunteered  as  a  member  of  a  patrol  which  was  to  cross  the 
Meuse  River,  by  swimming,  at  a  point  known  to  be  heavily  occupied  by 
enemy  detachments,  on  the  night  of  Nov.  9-10,  1918,  to  gain  information  of 
the  enemy  and  to  capture  jirisoneis.  When  the  members  of  the  patrol  reached 
the  middle  of  the  river  they  were  discovered  by  the  enemy  who  imniediftely 
opened  a  severe  fire  iipon  them,  using  arti'lery.  machine  guns,  and  hand 
grenades.  The  heavy  fire  compelled  all  but  six  men  to  return.  With  utter 
disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety  Private  Ponder,  ore  of  the  remaining 
members,  continued  on  the  mission  and  succeeded  in  crossing  the  river. 

Private,  first  class.  Battery  E,  18th  Field  Artillery.  3d  Division. 

During  heavy  shelling  by  the  enemy  Private  Pound  voluntarily  went  forward 
into  a  sheli-swept  area  in  front  of  the  battery  position  to  assist  in  bringing 
back  a  severely  wounded  man.  Private  Pound,  assisted  by  two  officers  of 
his  battery,  carried  the  wounded  man  under  heavy  fire  to  a  place  of  compara- 
tive safety  from  where  he  was  evacuated  to  the  rear.  The  utter  disregard  for 
his  own  personal  .safety  displayed  by  Private  Pound  was  an  inspiration  to 
the  entire  command. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  brother.  Burr  Pound. 

Corporal,  Company  I,  168th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

While  advancing  with  his  platoon  Corporal  Prien  located  a  well-defended 
enemy  machine-gun  nest  manne&lt;i  by  fourteen  men.  With  utter  disregard  of 
his  own  safety  he  fearlessly  advanced  through  heavy  enemy  machine-gun 
fire  and  sinde-handedly  attacked  the  machine-gun  nest  killing  or  capturing 
the  entire  crew. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  widow,  Mrs.  Hulda  L.  Prien.

tion to  duty  were  a  great  inspiration  to  the  members  of  his  organization.

Sergeant  Quick  displayed  great  bravery  in  bringing  up  a  gun  from  the  37-mm 
platoon,  and  in  the  face  of  enemy  machine-gun  and  sniper  fire  worked  his  way 
well  ahead  of  the  front  lines  and  concentrated  his  fire  on  the  enemy  machine- 
gun  nests  in  such  a  manner  that  they  were  soon  put  out  of  action,  thereby 
paving  the  way  for  the  advancing  line. 

Private,  Company  D,  105th  Machine  Gun  Battalion,  27th  Division. 

During  the  attack  on  the  Hindenburg  line  Private  Ratchick  displayed  unusual 
coolness  and  bravery  when  on  two  occasions  he  voluntarily  carried  wounded 
comrades  to  a  dressing  station  about  1,500  yards  distant,  and  each  time  re- 
turned to  his  company  over  a  road  that  was  being  swept  by  heavy  artillery 
and  machine-gun  fire.  By  his  utter  disregard  of  personal  danger  Private 
Ratchick  set  an  example  which  was  of  the  utmost  value  to  his  company  then 
and  throughout  all  of  its  subsequent  engagements. 

Private,  Company  G,  165th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Private  Riordan  displayed  unusual  courage  and  bravery  when,  with  utter  dis- 
regard of  his  own  personal  danger,  he  left  his  shelter  and  went  forward  under 
heavy  machine-gun  and  shell  fire  in  an  attempt  to  rescue  a  wounded  comrade. 
In  the  performance  of  this  heroic  act  he  was  instantly  killed  by  a  bursting 
shell. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  brother,  John  J.  Riordan. 

First  lieutenant,  18th  Field  Artillery,  3d  Division. 

During  heavy  shelling  by  the  enemy  Lieutenant  Rivers,  without  hesitation, 
left  the  shelter  of  his  dugout  and  went  forward  to  rescue  a  severely  wounded 
man.  With  careful  deliberation  he  raised  the  wounded  man,  and  aided  by 
another  officer  and  an  enlisted  man  who  had  also  gone  forward,  they  carried 
him,  under  heavy  fire,  to  a  place  of  comparative  safety,  from  where  he  was 
evacuated  to  the  rear.  The  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety  dis- 
played by  Lieutenant  Rivers  was  an  inspiration  to  the  entire  command. 

Private,  first  class,  Battery  A,  10th  Field  Artillery,  3d  Division. 

Private  Robey,  at  great  personal  risk,  maintained  his  telephone  lines  in  spite  of 
heavy  shell  fire,  keeping  liaison  by  telephone  operation  from  Sept.  30  to  Oct. 
9,  1918.  On  the  night  of  Oct.  10-11,  1918,  Private  Robey  repaired  the  line  to 
battalion  headquarters  by  holding  the  line  in  his  hand  and  following  it  until 
the  break  was  found,  being  forced  to  pass  through  heavy  enemy  fire  of  high 
explosive  and  gas  shells,  and  wearing  his  gas  mask  continuously.  Several 
times  during  the  night  he  made  such  repairs  thus  maintaining  vitally  neces- 
sary telephone  contacts.  While  on  duty  with  his  organization  Private  Robey 
made  the  supreme  sacrifice  on  Oct.  11,  1918. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  Mark  E.  Robey. 

Private,  Company  C,  lOrth  Infantry,  27th  Division. 

After  the  advance  of  his  company  had  been  stopped  by  strong  hostile  machine- 
gun  fire,  Private  Ross,  wit)i  4  companions,  advanced  far  ahead  of  the  front  line 
to  attack  an  enemy  position  located  in  a  large  farmhouse.  By  the  accurate 
fire  of  his  rifle  and  eSective  use  of  hand  grenades,  he  succeeded  in  putting  an 
enemy  machine  gun  out  of  action  and  causing  its  crew  to  withdraw.  This 
made  it  possible  for  him  and  his  companions  to  skillfully  maneuver  in  the 
broad  daylight  to  cover  all  entrances  to  the  house  and  force  the  surrender  of 
the  entire  force  of  the  enemy,  numbering  36  men  and  2  officers.  During  the 
e.xploit  they  killed  2  Germans  who  attempted  to  take  cover  in  the  cellar. 

Private,  Company  A,  105th  Infantry,  27th  Division. 

During  the  operations  against  the  Hindenburg  line  Private  Rover,  with  an  ofH- 
cer  and  three  sergeants,  occupied  an  outpost  position  in  advance  of  the  line 
which  was  attacked  by  a  superior  force  of  the  enemy.  Private  Rover  assisted 
in  repulsing  this  attack  and  in  killing  10  Germans,  capturing  5,  and  driving 
olf  the  others.  The  bravery  and  determination  displayed  by  this  group  were 
an  inspiration  to  all  who  witnessed  it. 

Private,  Company  F,  107th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Private  Rowan  accompanied  by  another  soldier  volunteered  to  rescue  his  pla- 
toon commander  who  had  been  seriously  wounded.  Although  under  severe 
enemy  artillery,  machine-gun,  and  rifle  fire,  these  .soldiers,  with  utter  disre- 
gard for  their  own  personal  danger,  advanced  to  the  rescue  of  the  fallen  offi- 
cer, and  with  great  difficulty  carried  him  to  .safety.  This  heroic  action  on 
the  part  of  Private  Rouan  and  his  companion  without  a  doubt  saved  the  offi- 
cer's life  and  set  a  splendid  example  of  heroism,  self-sacrifice,  and  devotion 
to  duty. 

Captain,  7th  Infantry,  3d  Division. 

On  the  morning  of  Oct.  4,  1918,  Captain  Schtrien  led  the  first  %vave  of  his  com- 
pany in  an  attack  on  Hill  241,  north  of  Cierges.  Early  in  the  attack  the 
entire  company  advanced  in  the  face  of  terrific  shell  and  machine-gun  fire. 
Owing  to  the  severity  of  the  fire  the  attack  was  held  up  on  the  south  side  of 
the  hill.  Captain  Schuicn  then  personally  led  a  small  reconnaissance  party 
over  the  enemy  slope,  during  the  performance  of  wliich  he  was  severely 
wounded,  but  when  carried  back  to  our  front  lines  and  while  lying  prostrate 
on  the  ground,  being  unable  to  walk,  ho  continued  to  command  his  company 
and  so  directed  the  disposition  of  his  command  that  another  counlerattack 
was  prevented.  Having  organized  his  position  he  was  carried  to  the  first- 
aid  station.  His  brilliant  leadership  under  fire  and  his  devotion  to  duty 
after  having  been  .seriously  wounded  were  an  inspiration  to  those  who  served

Sergeant,  Company  L,  105th  Infantry,  27th  Division. 

During  the  advance  when  his  platoon  was  halted  by  heavy  fire.  Sergeant  Scott 
worked  his  way  forward  alone,  and  with  rifle  and  grenade  fire  attacked  and 
put  out  of  action  an  enemy  machine-gun  post.  His  action  enabled  his  com- 
pany to  continue  the  advance.  Later  the  same  day  he  led  a  small  detachment 
forward  to  a  dangerous  flanking  position,  engaged  the  enemy,  and  drove 
them  back.  On  Sept.  29,  Sergeant  Scott  assisted  in  carrying  a  wounded 
soldier  through  an  exposed  area  under  heavy  fire  to  a  place  of  safety. 

First  lieutenant,  119th  Infantry,  30th  Division. 

Discovering  that  the  right  flank  of  his  battalion  was  exposed  and  unprotected ^ 
Lieutenant  Scott,  with  utter  disregard  of  his  own  danger,  made  a  personal 
reconnaissance  of  the  exposed  flank  under  heavy  enemy  fire.  Returning  to 
his  company  he  reported  the  situation  to  his  company  commander  and  was 
given  two  small  platoons  to  form  a  flank  guard.  Under  withering  machine- 
gun  fire  of  the  enemy.  Lieutenant  Scott  successfully  organized  his  position 
and  by  his  fearlessness  and  imlomitable  courage  so  inspire&lt;l  his  men  that 
they  held  their  ground,  thus  preventing  a  break-through  that  might  havo 
been  fatal  to  his  regiment. 

Sergeant,  Battery  D,  76th  Field  Artillery,  3d  Division. 

When  his  battery,  in  direct  support  of  the  Infantry  in  front  of  Romagne,  suffered 
35  percent  casualties.  Sergeant  Sessionf:  continually  exposed  himself  to  violent 
artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  in  order  to  maintain  tlic  morale  of  his  section. 
Wounded  early  in  November,  he  concealed  this  fact  and  although  suffering 
greatly  continued  effectively  to  command  his  section,  and  refused  to  be 
relieved  until  after  the  armistice  when  he  collapsed  and  was  ordered 
evacuated. 

Captain,  142d  Infantry,  3fith  Division. 

While  leading  his  company  during  the  attack  on  the  morning  of  Oct.  8,  1918. 
Captain  Simpson  was  severely  wounded,  but  refused  to  be  evacuated  until 
his  senior  lieutenant  had  been  sent  to  him  in  order  that  he  could  explain  the 
tactical  situation  and  turn  over  the  command  of  his  company.  Although 
suffering  intense  pain,  Captain  Simpson  endeavored  to  conceal  the  seriousness 
of  his  wounds,  thereby  displaying  extraordinary  heroism  and  devotion  to 
duty  which  were  an  inspiration  to  the  men  of  his  company. 

Major,  167th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

After  his  battalion  had  been  engaged  against  the  enemy  for  about  2  hours  and 
had  suffered  heavy  casualties,  in  order  to  accomplish  his  mission  Afajor  Smith, 
with  utter  disregard  for  his  own  personal  safety,  placed  himself  at  the  head  of 
his  battalion  and  led  it  in  a  charge  against  the  enemy  through  heavy  hostile 
machine-gun  and  artillery  Are.  During  the  charge  Major  Smith  was  severely 
wounded  but  continued  to  lead  his  battalion  until  his  objective  was  reached. 
His  undaunted  courage  greatly  inspired  the  men  of  his  command,  raising 
their  morale  to  a  high  degree. 

Second  lieutenant,  305th  Machine-Gun  Battalion.  77th  Division. 

When  the  Meuse  River  was  reached  it  was  found  unfordable,  thereby  making 
it  necessary  to  construct  a  bridge.  Lieutenant  Smith,  in  charge  of  a  platoon 
of  four  machine  guns,  sited  two  guns  to  support  the  engineers  building  this 
bridge.  He  then  crossed  the  river  alone  under  heavy  machine-gun  fire  on 
the  partly  completed  bridge  in  order  to  locate  the  enemy.  He  advanced  on 
the  supposed  location  of  enemy  machine-gun  nests  and  fired  upon  them  with 
a  rifle.  Two  of  the  enemy  then  surrendered  and  several  others  fled.  Holding 
his  prisoners  at  the  bridgehead,  he  continued  to  fire  on  the  retreating  enemy 
until  the  bridge  was  completed  and  the  patrols  had  crossed. 

Private,  Medical  Detachment.  125th  Infantry,  32d  Division. 

Private  Smith  established  a  collecting  point  for  the  wounded  in  the  valley  north 
of  Hill  25S,  during  the  attack  of  his  battalion.  The  unit  on  the  right,  which 
was  being  subjected  to  an  extremely  heavy  machine-gun  fire  from  the  enemy 
was  unable  to  advance,  thus  exposing  the  right  flank  of  his  battalion  to  a 
severe  machine-gun  fire.  The  terrain  afforded  no  protection  to  anyone  at- 
tempting to  cross  and  a  runner  while  attempting  to  cross  this  terrain  was 
severely  wounded,  falling  in  an  expo.sed  position.  Private  Smith,  with  splen- 
did heroism  and  courage,  dashed  across  the  exposed  area  and  carried  his 
wounded  comrade  in  to  our  lines  and  rendered  first  aid. 

Private.  Company  G,  320th  Infantry,  SOth  Division. 

When  the  advance  of  his  platoon  had  been  temporarily  halted  by  intensive 
fire  from  an  enemy  machine-gun  nest,  Private  Smith  displayed  exct  ptional 
bravery  and  leadership  whon,  on  his  own  initiative,  he  organized  a  number 
of  scattered  troops  and  courageously  led  them  forward,  capturing  the  machine 
guns  and  several  prisoners,  thus  enabling  his  platoon  to  continue  the  advance. 

First  lieutenant,  1.57th  Field  Artillery  Brigade,  82d  Division. 

In  the  face  of  terrific  enemy  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  Lieutenant  Snyder, 
accompanied  by  another  officer,  voluntarily  made  his  way  forward  and  be- 
yond the  advanced  infantry  lines  for  a  distance  of  several  hundred  yards. 
I'pon  reaching  the  advanced  infantry  lines  they  separated,  but  first  made 
plans  so  that  the  information  obtained  might  be  carried  back  by  either  of- 
ficer. After  a  very  thorough  reconnaissance  they  located  the  enemy  positions 
and  strong  points  which  were  holding  up  the  advance.  They  then  success- 
fully returned  to  our  lines  and  communicated  the  information  to  the  nearest 
artillery  which  concentrated  fire  upon  the  critical  points  and  silenced  the 
enemy  resistance,  thereby  permitting  the  Infantry  to  resume  the  advance.

Sergeant,  Company  M,  168th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Sergeant  Stansbfrry,  single-handed,  captured  a  machine-gun  post  with  20  prison- 
ers. In  the  face  of  heavy  machine-gun  fire  he  later  toolc  a  pair  of  pliers  from  a 
wire  cutter  who  had  been  killed,  cut  a  path  through  the  wire,  and  led  his 
platoon  forward  in  the  attack.  The  extraordinary  heroism  displayed  by 
Sergeant  Stambeny  was  a  great  inspiration  to  the  members  of  his  organization. 

Captain,  126th  Infantry,  32d  Division. 

When  the  troops  on  the  left  cf  the  attacking  line  were  held  up  by  intense  enemy 
macliine-gun  fire  from  Cote  Dame  Marie,  Captain  Strom  volunteered  to  go 
forward  with  a  squad  of  men  to  clean  out  the  enemy  machine-gun  nests.  With 
utter  disregard  for  liis  own  personal  danger  Captain  Strom  heroically  advanced 
with  about  0  men  who  were  armed  with  rifles  and  hand  grenades,  and  suc- 
ceeded in  either  killing  or  capturing  about  12  of  the  enemy  and  completely 
silencing  the  machine  guns,  which  permitted  the  battalion  to  continue  the 
advance  and  resulted  in  the  saving  of  the  lives  of  many  of  his  comrades. 

Private,  first  class.  Medical  Detachment,  101st  Infantry,  2fith  Division. 

During  the  advance  around  Chateau-Thierry,  Company  B  of  the  regiment  tO' 
which  Private  Sullivari  was  attached  became  surrounded  by  the  enemy. 
Their  losses  were  extremely  heavy  and  it  appeared  as  though  the  entire  com- 
pany would  be  wiped  out  or  captured.  After  several  men  had  been  killed  in- 
attempting  to  pet  through  the  enemy  lines  to  obtain  assistance,  Private  Sul- 
livan volunteered  to  make  the  attempt  and  succeeded  in  getting  through  and 
bringin?  assistance  from  Company  H,  thus  enabling  the  company  to  continue 
its  advance. 

Corporal,  Company  L,  131st  Infantry,  33d  Division. 

Voluntarily  leaving  his  shelter,  Corporal  Stvabey  led  a  detachment  of  2  other 

soldiers  200  yards  across  an  open  field  swept  by  shell  fire  and  captured  a 

machine  gun  which  was  harassing  our  front  line. 


Bugler,  Company  D,  131st  Infantry,  33d  Division. 

When  his  company  was  in  a  perilous  position,  due  to  lack  of  ammunition  and 
of  water,  Bugler  Swift  volunteered  to  carry  a  msssage  requesting  aid  to  bat- 
talion headquarters,  through  a  zone  swept  by  heavy  artillery  fire,  after  two 
runners  had  been  killed  in  the  attempt.  While  carrying  the  message  he  was 
severely  wounded  but  continued  on  his  mission,  delivered  his  message,  and 
died  on  the  way  to  the  dressing  station. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  Ben  W.  Swift. 

Corporal,  Company  D,  362d  Infantry,  91st  Division. 

Although  severely  wounded.  Corporal  Tennille  continued  to  fulfill  his  duties 
in  action  and,  with  utter  disregard  of  his  own  personal  danger,  went  forward 
alone  and  captured  a  niaohine-?;tin  nest  of  2  machine  guns  and  approximately 
6  men,  routing  al!  of  the  defenders. 

Major,  13th  Cavalry,  U.  S.  Army. 

Major  Tompkins  requested  and  received  authority  to  pursue  a  superior  force 
of  bandits  into  Mexico.  Although  wounded  early  in  the  pursuit,  he  carried 
on  a  running  fight  with  the  bandits  for  several  miles,  inflicting  heavy  losses 
upon  them,  and  stopped  the  piusuit  only  when  men  and  horses  were  ex- 
hausted and  ammunition  was  reduced  to  a  few  rounds  per  man. 


Major,  111th  Machine-Oun  Battalion,  29th  Division. 

On  October  10,  1918,  north  of  Samogeux,  France,  with  utter  disregard  for  his 
own  personal  safety,  Major  Tydings  made  a  personal  reconnaissance  and 
located  the  enemy  lines.  He  also  assisted  in  the  capture  of  3  prisoners,  1 
machine  gun  and  1  minnenwerfer,  all  of  whicii  were  returned  to  our  lines. 
On  Oct.  23,  1918,  in  the  attack  on  Etrayes  Ridge,  he  again  displayed  excep- 
tional gallantry  iu  making  personal  reconnaissance  and  in  maintaining 
liaison  between  the  units  of  his  battahon  although  he  was  frequently  under 
severe  enemy  artillery  fire.  His  continued  personal  reconnaissance  of  front- 
line positions  made  possible  an  etTective  flisposal  of  machine  guns  and  artillery 
in  the  support  of  the  ellorts  of  the  Infantry  to  advance  which  contributed  in 
a  largo  measure  to  the  success  of  the  brigade  with  which  his  command  was 
operating.  The  heroic  personal  conduct  displayed  by  Major  Tydings  was 
an  inspiration  to  all  the  ollicers  and  men  of  his  command. 

Sergeant,  Company  H,  138th  Infantry,  35th  Division. 

Just  as  a  raid  was  about  to  be  launched,  Sergeant  Vonland  assumed  command 
of  a  section  almost  demoralized  by  being  deitrived  of  its  only  ollicer,  led  it  to 
its  objective,  and  protected  the  loft  flank  of  the  company.  Having  accom- 
plished this  mission  he  then  assisted  the  woiluded  back  from  the  enemy 
trenches  despite  heavy  machine-gun  and  shell  fire.  Sergeant  V'onland's 
instant  acceptance  of  the  responsibility  and  gallant  conduct  in  this  action 
demanded  exceptional  courage  and  Icadcrslnp,  and  were  an  inspiration  to&gt; 
his  comrades.

Captain,  Machine-Oun  Company,  9th  Infantry,  2d  Division. 

In  command  of  Machine-Oun  Company,  9th  Infantry,  Captain  Weems  person- 
ally took  charge  of  his  advanced  positions  and  manned  captured  enemy 
machine  guns  on  an  exposed  flank  of  the  battalion.  By  his  coolness  and  dar- 
ing in  fearlessly  exposing  himself  to  the  enemy  fire  in  order  that  he  might  per- 
sonally direct  the  fire  of  his  guns,  he  succeeded  in  breaking  down  the  counter- 
attack of  the  enemy  upon  the  exposed  flank  of  the  battalion. 

First  lieutenant.  Medical  Corps,  102d  Infantry,  26th  Division. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

Lieutenant  Wesselhoeft,  despite  intense  machine-gun  and  artillery  fire,  courage- 
ously established  and  operated  his  aid  stations  clo.se  to  the  front  lines.  On 
July  18,  1918,  when  the  infantry  retired,  he  maintained  his  aid  station  in 
advance  of  our  own  front  lines,  refused  to  leave  the  wounded  unattended,  and 
remained  with  them  until  the  lines  were  reestablished. 


First  lieutenant.  Company  M,  109th  Infantry,  28th  Division. 

Although  being  wounded  and  refusing  medical  aid.  Lieutenant  Wheeler,  real- 
izing that  his  platoon  was  almost  entirely  surrounded  by  the  enemy  and  was 
suffering  heavy  losses,  ordered  his  men  to  crawl  one  by  one  through  a  small 
opening  in  the  woods  that  he  had  just  discovered  and  which  was  not  yet 
covered  by  enemy  fire.  Taking  several  rifles  and  ammunition,  he  placed 
himself  in  an  advantageous  position  and  covered  the  withdrawal  of  his  men 
until  he  himsflf  was  entirely  surrounded  by  the  enemy.  In  so  doing,  he  was 
again  wounded  but  succeeded  in  accomplishing  his  mission.  His  coolness, 
courage,  and  utter  disregard  of  his  own  personal  danger  were  a  source  of  great 
inspiration  to  his  men. 

Corporal,  Company  H,  101st  Infantry,  26th  Division. 

His  patrol  having  withdrawn  to  our  own  lines  after  an  encounter  with  a  superior 
enemy  patrol.  Corporal  White  voluntarily  went  out  in  advance  of  our  lines, 
and  under  heavy  machine-gun  fire  brought  back  a  wounded  member  of  the 
patrol  who  had  been  left  lying  near  the  enemy  wire. 

Corporal,  Company  F,  167th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Corporal  Whitworth  accompanied  by  another  soldier  volunteered  to  rescue  his 
platoon  commander  who  had  been  seriously  wounded.  Although  under 
severe  enemy  artillery,  machine-gun,  and  rifle  fire  these  soldiers,  with  utter 
disregard  for  their  own  personal  danger,  advanced  to  the  rescue  of  the  fallen 
officer,  and  with  great  difficulty  carried  him  to  safety.  This  heroic  action  on 
the  part  of  Corporal  Whitworth  and  his  companion  without  a  doubt  saved  the 
officer's  life  and  set  a  splendid  example  of  heroism,  self-sacrifice,  and  devotion 
to  duty. 

First  lieutenant.  Medical  Corps,  attached  to  168th  Infantry,  42d  Division. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

Lieutenant  Williams  went  forward  with  his  battalion  and  cared  for  the  wound- 
ed under  difficult  circumstances.  He  was  without  shelter,  food,  and  sleep  for 
practically  three  days.  The  area  over  which  he  worked  was  constantly  swept 
with  artillery  and  machine-gun  fire  and  was  drenched  with  poisonous  gas. 
He  was  always  close  behind  his  battalion  with  his  aid  post,  the  selection  of  its 
location  being  at  all  times  for  the  benefit  of  the  wounded  and  not  as  a  matter 
of  personal  safety.  Much  of  his  work  was  at  night,  where  enemy  observa- 
tion and  ab.sence  of  suitable  cover  made  it  impossible  to  use  lights  of  any 
kind,  but  taxing  himself  to  his  fullest  powers  of  strength,  endurance,  and 
skill  he  dressed  the  wounded  in  darkness  by  sense  of  touch  alone.  Although 
given  permission  and  advised  to  withdraw  farther  to  the  rear  and  to  a  less 
exposed  position,  he  expressed  his  desire  to  remain  in  the  forward  lines  in  order 
to  give  his  services  as  soon  as  possible  to  the  wounded  men. 

Private,  first  class.  Sanitary  Detachment,  108th  Field  Artillery,  2.';th  Division. 

Private  Wilson  voluntarily  went  forward  under  heavy  enemy  artillery  fire  and 
rendered  first  aid  to  wounded  men  of  the  103d  Engineers  who  were  lying  in 
an  exposed  position.  He  then  crawled  along  a  railroad  track  for  about  300 
yards,  secured  an  ambulance  which  had  been  abandoned  due  to  the  intensity 
of  enemy  shell  fire,  and  made  three  trips  over  abridge  under  continual  fire 
to  an  advanced  dressing  station,  safely  evacuating  14  of  the  wounded. 

Second  lieutenant,  Company  E,  313th  Infantry,  79th  Division. 

After  being  wounded  in  the  arm  on  the  morning  of  Sept.  27,  1918,  Lieutenant 
Withers  refused  medical  attention  and  remained  in  command  of  his  platoon 
in  action  for  2  days  and  nights  until  ordered  to  the  rear  by  the  battalion 
surgeon  on  Sept.  29,  1918.  The  courage  and  leadership  displayed  by  Lieu- 
tenant Withers  greatly  in.spired  the  officers  and  men  of  his  battalion  and  were 
important  factors  in  the  capture  of  Montfaucon  and  the  positions  to  the 
north,  by  the  313th  Infantry.

First  lieutenant,  observer,  12th  Aero  Squadron,  Air  Service. 

Lieutenant  Wright  and  First  Lt.  Robert  C.  Puradise,  pilot,  were  assigned  the 
duty  of  locating  the  American  front  lines  during  the  larst  2  hours  of  the  Ar- 
gonne  offensive.  Unable  to  locate  the  lines  at  the  usual  altitude  maintained 
at  such  a  time,  they  flew  down  to  the  dangerous  altitude  of  50  meters,  secured 
the  important  information  sought,  and  discovered  out  lines  held  up  by  a 
strongly  held  nest  of  enemy  machine  guns.  Noting  the  exact  location  of  the 
nest  upon  their  map  they  flew  back  to  division  headquarters  and  reported 
the  exact  location  of  our  lines,  as  well  as  that  of  the  enemy  machine-gun  nest. 
With  their  plane  riddled  by  enemy  bullets,  one  control  shot  away,  they 
returned  to  the  lines,  discovered  the  enemy  nests  had  not  been  destroyed,  and 
that  they  were  inflicting  heavy  casualties  upon  our  troops.  In  the  face  of 
concentiated  enemy  fire  and  attacked  by  four  enemy  planes  they  went  down, 
their  plane  barely  skimming  the  tree  tops,  and  deliberately  fired  over  400 
rounds  into  the  enemy  nests,  thus  causing  the  enemy  gunners  to  abandon 
their  guns  and  positions  and  enabling  the  troops  of  their  division  to  resume 
their  advance.  Again  gaining  altitude  they  discovered  and  destroyed  by 
their  fire  an  enemy  signal  station,  signaling  unmolested,  two  kilometers 
north  of  the  lines.  This  act  was  performed  at  an  altitude  of  50  meters  amid  a 
storm  of  protection  fire  from  enemy  antiaircraft  guns. 

Captain,  167th  Infantry,  42d  Di-^-ision. 

Captain  Wyait  led  his  company  across  the  Ourcq  River  under  heavy  enemy 
artillery  and  machiue-eun  fire,  and  upon  reaching  the  opposite  side  of  the 
river  attacked  the  enemy  and  although  severely  wounded  he  eontmued  to 
lead  his  company  to  the  enemy's  position.  Before  reaching  his  objective 
Captain  Wyatt  personally  organized  and  led  a  squad  of  his  company  forward 
and  captured  a  machine-gun  nest  which  was  holding  up  the  advance.  His 
devotion  to  duty  was  a  great  inspiration  to  his  men  as  he  remained  in  com- 
mand until  his  objective  was  reached,  when  due  to  his  severe  wounds  he  fell 
unconscious  and  was  forced  to  be  evacuated. 

First  lieutenant,  Company  F,  355th  Infantry,  89th  Division. 

Because  of  his  known  courage  and  leadership  Lieutenant  Yarbrough  was  selected 
to  lead  a  patrol  of  15  men  which  was  to  cross  the  Meuse  River  by  swimming 
in  order  to  gain  information  and  capture  prisoners.  When  the  men  were  in 
the  middle  of  the  river  they  were  fired  upon  by  the  enemy  and  all  except  6 
men  were  compelled  to  return.  Lieutenant  Yarbrmtgh  with  the  5  remaining 
men  continued  the  advance.  Lieutenant  Yarbrough  himself  succeeding  in 
reaching  the  enemy  side  of  the  river,  where  a  few  moments  later  he  made  the 
supreme  sacrifice  while  endeavoring  to  carry  out  his  mission. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  mother,  Mrs.  Daisy  G.  Horsley.

Secretary  of  War. 

As  Secretary  of  War  during  the  World  War  Mr.  Baker  was  responsible  for  the 
organization,  development,  and  completion  of  a  military  program  which 
brought  success  to  the  American  arms.  Throughout  the  war  he  rendered 
services  of  inestimable  value  to  the  country. 

Colonel,  Infantry,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  exceptionally  meritorious  and  distinguished  services  as  Inspector,  42d 
Division;  G-5,  General  Headquarters,  American  Expeditionary  Forces  and 
G-3,  Sixth  Army  Corps.  While  serving  as  G-5,  General  Headquarters, 
American  Expeditionary  Forces,  Colonel  Baltzell  was  charged  with  the 
supervision  of  the  Army  schools,  training  inspections  of  troops,  and  the  prep- 
aration of  studies  on  military  education.  In  all  of  these  positions  of  great 
responsibility  Colonel  Baltzell  displayed  professional  attainments  of  high 
order,  untiring  energy  and  devotion  to  duty,  and  contributed  in  a  very  great 
degree  to  the  satisfactory  training  of  officers  and  troops  of  the  American  Expe- 
ditionary Forces  and  to  the  development  of  the  present  system  of  military 
schools  in  the  United  States. 

Major,  Medical  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

At  the  time  of  the  influenza  epidemic  in  1918,  Major  Beach  was  serving  as  camp 
surgeon  at  Camp  Greene,  North  Carolina.  By  his  foresightedness  in  provid- 
ing ample  hospital  facilities  during  the  early  stages  of  the  epidemic  and  by 
his  efficient  action  in  directing  the  care  of  patients,  he  was  primarily  respon- 
sible for  a  large  reduction  in  the  mortality  rate  at  that  camp.  His  efforts  were 
untiring  and  he  continued  until  he  was  stricken  with  the  malady  in  its  most 
serious  form.  He  showed  a  rare  devotion  to  duty  in  that,  although  himself 
a  sufferer  from  the  disease,  his  efforts  were  unabated. 

Major,  Infantry,  U.  S.  Army. 

Major  Caffey  rendered  valuable  services  as  assistant  to  the  Assistant  Chief  of

Army.  By  his  remarkably  keen  foresight,  his  rare  qualities  of  leadership,  his 
fearless  courage  and  sound  judgment  and  ability,  he  contributed  immeas- 
urably to  the  success  attained  by  the  commands  with  which  he  served  and 
rendered  services  of  great  value  to  the  American  Expeditionary  Forces.

ous services  in  connection  with  the  studies  of  epidemic  influenza  and  pneu- 
monia, and  due  to  the  high  degree  of  efTiciency  displayed  by  him  the  mortality 
rate  at  this  port  was  held  to  a  minimum.  Colonel  Camming' s  research  work 
while  at  this  port  has  proved  of  great  value  to  the  military  forces. 

Lieutenant  colonel.  Cavalry,  U.  S.  Army. 

As  inspector  of  the  5th  Army  Corps,  Colonel  Dallam  demonstrated  an  unusually 
high  degree  of  professional  attainments,  ability,  and  devotion  to  duty  in  the 
tasks  assigned  to  him,  including  the  inspection  of  conduct  and  methods  of 
supply,  instruction  of  troops,  and  investigation  of  vital  and  difficult  problems 
of  administration,  thereby  contributing  materially  to  the  successful  operations 
of  the  5th  Army  Corps,  and  rendering  important  services  to  the  .\merican 
Expeditionary  Forces  in  the  operations  against  the  enemy  during  the  St. 
Mihiel  and  Meuse-Argonne  offensives. 

Major,  Adjutant  General's  Department,  U.  S.  Army. 

As  adjutant  general,  Base  Section  No.  1,  St.  Nazaire,  France,  and  as  acting 
chief  of  staff  of  that  section  from  Sept.  4  to  Dec.  14,  1918,  Major  Daniell  dis- 
played unusual  executive  and  administrative  skill,  ^ound  judgment,  and 
devotion  to  duty  in  the  nmltiplicily  of  detail  involved  in  the  operation  of  the 
section,  notably  in  connection  with  tioop  moveu.ent  problems.  The  grave 
responsibilities  placed  upon  Major  Daniell  were  met  in  a  sij-'nally  successful 
manner,  and  he  contributed  materially  to  the  successful  operations  of  Base 
Section  No.  i,  American  Expeditionary  Forces. 

Major  general,  U.  S.  Army. 

After  having  organized  the  26th  Division,  General  Edwards  commanded  it  with 
distinction  during  all  but  18  days  of  its  active  service  at  the  front.  The  high 
qualities  of  leadership  and  unfailing  devotion  to  duty  displayed  by  him  were 
responsible  for  the  marked  esprit  and  morale  of  his  comnumd.  To  his  marked 
tactical  ability  and  energy  are  largely  due  the  brilliant  successes  achieved  by 
the  20th  National  Guard  Division  during  its  operations  against  the  enemy 
from  Feb.  4,  1918.  to  Nov.  11,  1918.    General  Eduards  died  Feb.  14,  1931.

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

A  bronze  oak -leaf  for  exceptionally  meritorious  and  distinguished  services. 

\s  personal  representative  of  the  President  in  Nicaragua  and  Chairman  of  the 
Electoral  Board  during  1927  and  1928,  General  McCoy  combined  to  a  marked 
degree  the  qualities  of  diplomat  and  soldier  and  displayed  excellent  and  sound 
judgment  in  a  position  of  great  responsibility,  conducting  a  difficult  mission 
with  fairness,  justice,  and  tact,  thereby  commanding  the  respect  of  all  factions, 
the  acceptance  by  all  political  parties  of  the  results  of  the  election,  and  the 
free  expression  of  the  Nicaraguan  people.  In  connection  with  our  relations 
with  Latin  America  this  outstanding  achievement  of  General  McCoy,  in  the 
face  of  seemingly  insurmountable  obstacles,  has  brought  great  credit  to  him- 
self and  to  the  Army  of  the  United  States.

Private,  Company  H,  16th  Infantry,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  displayed  at  Fort  Jay,  N.  Y.,  June  6,  1936.  Seeing  a  prisoner 
crawl  through  the  raihng  on  top  of  the  sea  wall  near  the  Fort  Jay  greenhouse 
and  jump  into  the  water,  Private  Addaman  unhesitatingly  plunged  into  the 
strong  tidal  current  of  New  York  Bay  and  with  much  difficulty  succeeded 
in  rescuing  him  from  drowning  and  bringing  him  safely  to  shore. 

First  lieutenant,  Philippine  Scouts  (Q.  M.  C),  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  during  a  fire  at  the  gasoline  station,  Fort  William  McKinley, 
P.  I.,  on  July  27,  1928.  Lieutenant  Allen  saw  the  flames  around  the  gasoline 
station  while  200  yards  away.  Rushing  past  others  who  were  running  wildly 
away  from  the  fire  in  fear  of  an  explosion,  Lieutenant  Allen  disregarding  his 
own  danger  and  risk  of  life  reached  the  station  and  courageously  extinguished 
the  fire  in  the  funnel  through  which  gasoline  was  pouring  into  the  tank, 
thereby  preventing  a  serious  explosion. 

Captain,  27th  Infantry,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  displayed  January  20, 1932,  south  of  Pohakea  Pass,  Island  of  Oahu, 
Territory  of  Hawaii.  While  participating  in  a  reconnaissance,  Capt.  Emmett 
M.  Connor,  27th  Infantry,  fell  from  the  top  of  a  precipitous  mountain  to  a 
spot  300  feet  below,  breaking  one  leg  and  both  shoulders.  At  constantly 
recurring  risks  to  their  lives.  Captain  Andino  and  eight  soldiers  of  his  com- 
mand voluntarily  descended  to  the  aid  of  Captain  Connor,  administered 
first  aid,  strippedthemsel  ves  of  their  shirts  to  improvise  a  litter  and  to  provide 
warmth  for  the  injured  officer,  and  rescued  Captain  Connor.  For  4H  hours 
Captain  Andino  and  his  party  worked  cutting  a  trail  1,200  feet  over  precipices 
and  through  heavy  junglelike  underbrush.  They  carried  Captain  Connor 
down  this  precarious  trail,  where  a  misstep  might  have  resulted  in  death  or 
serious  injury,  and  delivered  him  to  the  hospital,  thereby  saving  him  from 
probable  fatal  effects  of  his  injuries.  The  heroic  conduct  and  devotion  to 
duty  displayed  by  Captain  Andino  reflect  great  credit  upon  himself  and  the 
Army. 

Major,  13th  Field  Artillery,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  displayed  in  rescuing  Pvt.  icl.  Alexander  J.  Kaye,  Service  Battery, 
13th  Field  Artillery,  from  drowning  at  Mokuleia,  Oahu,  Territory  of  Hawaii, 
on  the  evening  of  Apr.  21,  1933.  When  the  boat  in  which  they  were  riding 
capsized  on  a  surf-swept  coral  reef,  Private  Kaye  who  was  unable  to  swim 
ashore  clung  to  the  overturned  boat  while  his  companion  swam  ashore  to 
summon  aid.  In  response  to  the  call  for  help  Major  Andrus  and  three  com- 
panions, at  great  risk  of  their  lives,  went  to  the  rescue  in  two  small  rowboats. 
In  the  darkness  and  heavy  surf  both  boats  were  swamped  and  the  rescue 
party  swept  out  to  sea  making  their  way  back  with  difficulty.  Nevertheless, 
they  persisted  in  their  efforts  of  rescue  and,  after  several  hours  of  perilous 
effort  working  in  darkness  and  rough  sea,  succeeded  in  getting  a  line  to  the 
capsized  boat  and  bringing  Private  Kaye  safely  to  shore. 

Staff  sergeant,  70th  Service  Squadron,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  near  Oleander,  Calif.,  about  seven  miles  south  of  Fresno,  Calif., 
on  May  2,  1930.  While  riding  in  the  pilot's  cockpit  as  mechanic  in  charge  of 
Army  Fokker,  C-2  Transport,  the  micarta  propeller  blades  of  the  right  engine 
broke  at  the  hub  and  were  thrown  off,  one  blade  passing  through  the  cabin, 
the  other  striking  and  seriously  damaging  the  entering  edge  of  the  right  wing. 
The  damage  caused  by  the  blades  and  the  terrific  vibration  of  the  engine 
caused  a  violent  wing  fiutter  attendant  with  full  loss  of  aileron  control.  Par- 
tial fore  and  aft  control  remained  to  the  pilot  but  the  control  wheel  was  bounc- 
ing back  and  forth  through  a  considerable  arc.  Fearing  that  the  plane  would 
go  to  pieces  at  any  moment,  the  pilot  directed  Sergeant  Arthur  to  clear  the 
cabin  of  the  six  enlisted  men  who  were  passengers.  After  complying  with 
this  order.  Sergeant  Arthur,  instead  of  leaving  the  plane  himself,  elected  to 
remain  that  he  might  be  of  assistance  to  his  pilot  in  case  of  a  serious  crash 
which  seemed  imminent.  With  complete  disregard  of  his  own  personal 
safety  Sergeant  Arthur  remained  with  the  plane  until  the  landing  had  been 
made,  when  he  promptly  assured  himself  of  his  pilot's  safety.  Sergeant 
Arthur's  conduct  reflects  great  credit  upon  himself  and  the  military  service. 

Private,  Service  Battery,  4th  Coast  Artillery,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  displayed  during  a  fire  in  the  submarine  mine-loading  room  at 
Fort  Grant,  Canal  Zone,  on  Jan.  20,  1933.  Private  Babb  forced  his  way  mto 
the  mino-loading  room  and  removed  a  burning  box  containing  highly  explo- 
sive mine  detonators  and  extinguished  the  Arc,  thus  preventing  an  explosion 
which  would  undoubtedly  have  resulted  in  serious  damage  to  and  loss  of 
Government  property.

Private,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  at  Biggs  Field,  Fort  Bliss,  Tex.,  Juno  21,  1930.  Private  Bailey 
was  on  watch  in  the  airplane  hangar  on  the  evening  of  June  21,  1930,  when 
fire  broke  out  on  the  floor  near  a  7.-;0-gallon  tank  truck  filled  with  gasoline. 
When  Private  Bailey  first  saw  the  fire  it  had  caught  the  hose  on  the  rear  of  the 
tank  truck  and  the  flames  had  reached  the  top  of  the  tank,  which  was  filled 
with  aviation  gasoline.  With  disregard  of  his  own  personal  danger  Private 
Bailey  extinguished  the  fire,  thereby  preventing  considerable  damage  to  the 
truck,  building,  and  equipment,  had  an  explosion  occurred.  The  prompt 
action  on  the  part  of  Private  Bailey,  his  courage  and  bravery,  reflect  great 
credit  upon  himself  and  the  military  service. 

Contract  surgeon,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  on  July  10,  1926,  during  the  explosions  at  the  Lake  Denmark

surgeon  for  Picatinny  Arsenal,  was  in  his  oflice  in  Dover,  N.  J.,  when  he

of  other  serious  detonations,  they  reached  the  injured  woman,  rendered  first 
aid,  and  dispatched  the  patient  to  the  hospital.  The  rescue  was  made  at  a 
time  when  there  was  a  continuous  roar  of  exploding  magazines  and  when  the 
air  wns  filled  with  flying  shells,  stones,  and  fragments  of  buildings,  and  was 
effected  shortly  before  the  third  heavy  explosion  occurred.

risk  of  fatal  burns  to  his  own  person  extinguished  the  flames.  Although

submitting  to  treatment  for  his  own  injuries.

For  heroism  displayed  during  a  fire  at  the  Infantry  School  Reproduction  Plant,

The  water  supply  having  been  destroyed,  the  only  means  of  stopping  the 
fire  which  was  spreading  rapidly  over  the  entire  city  was  to  demolish  the 
partially  standing  structures  in  certain  areas.  Sergeant  Bennett  was  charged 
with  the  placing  and  detonating  of  the  charges  to  elTcct  this  demolition  and 
remained  for  2^  days  on  almost  continuous,  duty  in  the  burning  district.

tremors  which  caused  walls  and  roof  tiles  to  fall.  Disregarding  the  danger 
from  falling  stone  and  buildings  and  the  further  danger  of  placing  quantities 
of  explosives  in  close  prcximitv  to  the  fire,  Sergeant  Benmtt  placed  his  charges 
and  directed  the  efforts  of  his  men,  thereby  aiding  materially  in  cxtinguishinR 
the  fire  and  preventing  further  loss  of  life  and  propertv.

Private,  first  class.  19th  Pursuit  Squadron,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  displayed  in  assisting  in  saving  the  lives  of  three  men  from  drowning 
at  Haleiwa,  Oahu,  Territory  of  Hawaii,  on  Feb.  15,  1936.  A  boat  in  which 
two  soldiers  and  a  civilian  were  riding  capsized  in  the  rough  and  shark-infested 
waters  about  a  mile  from  shore,  placing  them  in  imminent  danger  of  drowning. 
When  an  attempt  to  rescue  them  by  means  of  a  small  craft  proved  futile  due 
to  the  e.xtremely  strong  current  and  high  waves,  Private  Bossert  and  another 
soldier  obtained  a  14-foot  open  outboard  motor  boat  and,  at  great  danger  to 
themselves  and  with  much  difficulty,  succeeded  in  reaching  the  men  and 
bringing  them  safely  to  shore. 

Corporal,  Headquarters  Battery,  8th  Field  ArtUlery,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  near  Honolulu,  Territory  of  Hawaii,  Nov.  18,  1930.  During  a 
violent  cloudburst  an  automobile  containing  three  occupants,  one  of  whom 
was  an  invalid,  was  swept  over  the  Moanalua  Bridge  into  a  swift,  turbulent 
stream  in  which  debris  of  every  description  was  being  carried  downstream. 
Corporal  Boutdin,  the  driver  of  the  automobile,  with  utter  disregard  for  his 
own  personal  danger  remained  with  the  other  occupants  in  the  car,  although 
told  to  leave  before  the  water  had  risen  to  a  dangerous  stage.  When  it  became 
apparent  that  the  car  would  be  swept  otT  the  bridge,  he  jumped  into  the  deep, 
raging  current,  swam  to  a  tree  and  with  much  difEculty  succeeded  in  rescuing 
the  invalid  member  of  the  party  as  she  drifted  by  and  held  her  up  on  a  limb 
of  the  tree  in  a  place  of  comparative  safety  for  several  hours  until  help  arrived. 
The  heroism  and  loyalty  displayed  by  Corporal  Bouldin  on  this  occasion

striker,  forcibly  disarmed  him,  and  placed  him  under  arrest.  His  courage 
and  coolness  averted  serious  trouble  in  a  tense  situation.

fire  from  reaching  the  open  tank ,  thereby  preventing  less  to  adjoining  property

For  heroism  at  Fort  Bragg,  N.  C,  June  4,  1931.  During  the  firing  of  a  155-mm 
howitzer  by  Battery  A,  5th  Field  Artillery,  the  muzzle  blast  ignited  the 
camouflage  net,  which  in  turn  ignited  the  grass  and  brush  in  the  immediate 
vicinity  of  the  howitzer.  Private  Coderre  and  the  members  of  the  gun  squad, 
with  utter  disregard  of  the  danger  of  an  explosion  from  shells  which  were  on

founded.

Army. 

For  heroism  at  Randolph  Field,  Tex.,  Jan.  25.  1932.  During  a  welding  opera- 
tion in  the  engineering  shop,  the  high-pressure  acetylene  cylinder  failed  to 
function,  resulting  in  a  disrupted  connection  between  the  hose  and  welding 
torch,  which  in  turn  caused  the  free  stream  of  gas  issuing  from  the  hose  to 
become  ignited  and  a  dangerous  explosion  to  become  imminent  by  the  rapid 
burning  of  the  hose  leading  to  the  cylinder.  Witnessing  the  accident.  Ser- 
geant Collins,  disregardful  of  his  own  personal  danger,  ran  to  the  cylinder, 
closed  it  valves,  and  extinguished  the  fire,  thereby  preventing  an  explosion 
of  the  gas  cylinder  and  serious  injury  to  personnel  in  the  building  and  damage

For  heroism  near  Honolulu,  Territory  of  Hawaii,  Nov.  18,  1930.  During  a 
violent  cloudburst,  an  automobile  containing  three  occupants  was  swept  over 
the Mcanalua  Bridge  into  a  swift,  turbulent  stream  in  which  debris  of  every 
description  was  being  carried  downstream.  The  occupants  of  the  car  suc- 
ceeded in  gaining  temporary  safety  among  the  branches  of  a  tree  in  the  midst 
of  the  flood  but  their  lives  were  imjieriled  by  the  rising  water,  .\fter  several 
attempts  had  been  made  to  rescue  them.  Private  Compo,  with  utter  disregard 
of  his  own  per.sonal  danger,  voluntarily  ventured  out  into  the  deep  raging 
current  and  had  almost  reached  the  persons  he  was  endeavoring  to  help 
when  he  was  swept  downstream  and  barely  escaped  being  drowned.  Al- 
though Private  Compo  was  unsuccessful  in  rescuing  these  persons,  the  at- 
tempt to  do  so  under  such  unfavorable  circumstances  characterizes  it  as  an 
act  of  outstanding  heroism. 

Private  first  class.  Company  E,  108th  Quartermaster  regiment,  Illinois  Na- 
tional Guard. 

For  heroism  displayed  at  Camp  Custer,  Mich.,  Aug.  17, 1936.  When  a  convoy

gallon  metal  drum  located  on  the  floor  of  the  station  wagon  was  also  being 
filled.  In  so  doing,  an  electric  spark  caused  the  gasoline  in  the  drum  to  ignite. 
Private  Cowan,  an  attendant  ot  the  refueling  station,  with  utter  disregard 
of  his  cwn  safety  drove  the  blazing  wagon  from  the  immediate  vicinity  of 
the  other  trucks  and  a  large  quantity  of  gasoline  to  an  isolated  area,  thereby 
preventing  destructive  fire,  explosions,  and  the  jeopardizing  of  life  and 
property.

and  several  enlisted  men,  when  one  of  the  enlisted  men  in  crossing  a  swollen 
branch  of  Duck  River  accidentally  fell  into  the  stream  and  was  drowning. 
Sergeant  Crone,  realizing  that  prompt  action  was  necessary  in  order  to  save 
the  soldier's  life,  jumped  into  the  water  fully  clothed  and,  unassisted,  reached 
the  soldier  and  brought  him  to  shore.  Sergeant  Crowe's  conduct  reflects  great 
credit  upon  himself  and  the  military  service.

of  the  Cniteil  States  Army  Transport  Camhrai,  Private  Dalton,  who  was  a 
member  of  the  guard  but  not  on  duty  at  the  time,  disregarded  personal  danger 
and  dived  overboard  in  an  attem[)t  to  save  the  drowning  patient.  He  man- 
aged to  get  hold  of  the  garments  of  the  sinking  body  but  the  suction  of  the 
propeller  pulled  him  away.  Although  Private  Dalton  was  unsuccessful  in 
rescuing  the  patient,  the  attempt  to  do  so  under  such  unfavorable  circum- 
stances and  at  the  risk  of  his  own  life  characterizes  it  as  an  act  of  outstanding 
heroism.

shot  by  the  bandit.  Corporal  Fox  who  was  stationed  in  front  of  the  recruiting 
office  on  Alarket  Street  was  attracted  by  the  report  of  gunshots  in  a  shop  close 
by  and  immediately  ran  to  the  scene.  With  the  assistance  of  a  passer-by 
Corporal  Fox  intercepted  the  bandit,  still  in  possession  of  his  gun,  subduing 
him  only  after  a  severe  struggle  and  then  held  him  captive  until  the  arrival  of 
the  police.  The  prompt  and  fearless  action  on  the  part  of  Corporal  Fox  reflects 
great  credit  upon  himself  and  the  military  service.

the  excruciating  heat,  succeeded  in  removing  the  exposed  explosives  to  a  place 
of  safety.  Thereupon  they  extinguished  the  flames  and  brought  a  daneerous 
fire  under  control.  The  high  degree  of  heroism  displayed  by  Corporal  Freeman

sibly of  human  life  and  is  characteristic  of  that  splendid  standard  upon  which

the  front  cockpit  of  the  burning  plane  and  extricated  one  of  the  passengers. 
Then,  upon  learning  that  the  pilot  was  still  in  the  cockpit,  Lieutenant  Ginvan- 
noli,  realizing  that  his  own  life  was  in  constant  peril  from  fire,  smoke,  and  fuel 
explosions,  rushed  back  into  the  flames  and  after  repeated  and  determined 
efforts,  being  badly  burned  in  the  attempt,  succeeded  in  extricating  the  pilot

the  river,  falling  over  on  its  side  with  the  wheels  in  the  air,  caught  fire,  the 
escaping  gasoline  burning  on  the  surface  of  the  water.  The  river  bank  at  this 
point  being  12  to  15  feet  high  and  slightly  overhanging  made  it  impossible  to 
climb  out  of  the  water  unassisted.  The  two  officers  were  clinging  to  parts  of 
the  burning  plane,  still  above  water,  both  appearing  to  be  in  a  dazed  condition, 
when  Private  Glover  and  Pvt.  Pniil  W.  Lemons,  who  were  early  on  the  scene, 
entered  the  water,  went  to  the  rescue  of  the  ofTicers,  succeeded  in  getting  them 
away  from  the  burning  plane  and  gasoline,  and  afloat  until  additional  assist- 
ance arrived,  when  the  ofTicers  were  taken  ashore  with  the  aid  of  ropes.  The 
bravery  and  courage  displayed  by  the.&lt;:e  two  soldiers  at  the  risk  of  their  lives 
reflect  great  credit  both  upon  themselves  and  the  military  service.

bers of  the  party  which  resulted  in  the  success  of  the  expedition,  four  of  the

For  heroism  at  Fort  Bragg,  N.  C,  June  4,  1931.  During  the  firing  of  a  155-mm 
howitzer  by  Battery  A,  5th  Field  Artillery,  the  muzzle  blast  ignited  the 
camouflage  net  which  in  turn  ignited  the  grass  and  brush  in  the  immeiliate 
vicinity  of  the  howitzer.  Private  Hill  and  the  other  members  of  the  gun 
squad,  with  utter  disregard  of  the  danger  of  an  explosion  from  shells  which 
were  on  a  burning  paulin  in  the  midst  of  the  flames,  rushed  from  the  gun 
pit  and,  despite  the  excruciating  heat,  succeeded  in  removing  the  exposed 
explosives  to  a  place  of  safety.  Thereupon  they  extinguished  the  flames 
and  brought  a  dangerous  fire  under  control.  The  high  degree  of  heroism  dis- 
played by  Private  Hill  on  this  occasion  contributed  to  the  saving  of  Govern- 
ment property  and  possibly  human  life  and  is  characteristic  of  that  splendid 
standard  upon  which  the  traditions  of  our  Military  Establishment  are 
founded.

carious trail,  where  a  misstep  might  have  resulted  in  death  or  serious  injury, 
and  delivered  him  to  the  hospital,  thereby  saving  him  from  probat)le  fatal 
effects  of  his  injuries.  The  heroic  conduct  and  devotion  to  duty  displayed  by

Steiuart  as  passenger,  crashed  into  the  bank  of  the  Missouri  River  while 
attempting  to  make  a  landing  during  a  heavy  rainstorm.  The  plane  fell  into 
the  river,  falling  over  on  its  side  with  the  wheels  in  the  air,  caught  fire,  the 
escaping  gasoline  burning  on  the  surface  of  the  water.  The  river  bank  at 
this  point  being  12  to  15  feet  high  and  slightly  overhanging  made  it  impossible 
to  climb  out  of  the  water  unassisted.  The  two  officers  were  clinging  to  parts 
of  the  burning  plane,  still  above  water,  both  appearing  to  be  in  a  dazed  con- 
dition, when  Pvt.  Sidney  R.  Glover  and  Private  Lemons,  who  were  early  on 
the  scene,  entered  the  water,  went  to  the  rescue  of  the  officers,  succeeded  in 
getting  them  away  from  the  burning  plane  and  gasoline,  and  afloat  until  addi- 
tional a.ssistance  arrived,  when  the  officers  were  taken  ashore  with  the  aid  of 
ropes.  The  bravery  and  courage  displayed  by  these  two  soldiers  at  the  risk 
of  their  lives  reflect  great  credit  both  upon  themselves  and  the  military 
service.

precipitating  the  occupants  into  the  turbulent  waters  where  they  gained 
temporary  safety  by  clinging  to  the  branches  of  a  tree.  Sergeant  Long,  who 
was  in  a  camp  nearby,  learned  of  the  accident,  and,  with  utter  disregard  of 
his  own  danger,  went  to  their  assistance.  By  wading  and  swimming  he 
reached  a  position  where  he  could  be  tied  to  a  rope  and  let  down  the  stream  to 
a  point  where,  after  numerous  trials,  he  was  able  to  pass  a  rope  to  Colonel 
Persons  and  the  three  civilians  clinging  to  the  trees,  repeating  this  operation 
until  all  were  rescued.  The  heroic  conduct  and  devotion  to  duty  displayed 
by  Sergeant  Long  reflect  great  credit  upon  himself  and  the  Army.

howitzer  by  Battery  A,  5th  Field  Artillery,  the  muzzle  blast  ignited  the 
camouflage  net  which  in  turn  ignited  the  grass  and  brush  in  the  immediate 
vicinity  of  the  howitzer.  Sergeant  Mackey  and  the  other  members  of  the  gun 
squad,"  with  utter  disregard  of  the  danger  of  an  explosion  from  shells  which 
were  on  a  burning  paulin  in  the  midst  of  the  flames,  rushed  from  the  gun  pit 
and,  despite  the  e.xcruciating  heat,  succeeded  in  removing  the  exposed  ex- 
plosives to  a  place  of  safety.  Thereupon  they  extinguished  the  flames  and 
brought  a  dangerous  fire  under  control.  The  high  degree  of  heroisin  dis- 
played by  Sergeant  Mackey  on  this  occasion  contributed  to  the  saving  of 
Government  property  and  possibly  of  human  life  and  is  characteristic  of  that 
splendid  standard  upon  which  the  traditions  of  our  Military  Establishment 
are  founded.

ron, Air  Corps,  had  fallen  into  a  dark  open  well,  Private  Mauchline,  with 
utter  disregard  of  his  own  personal  danger,  dived  head  first  into  the  well, 
without  knowledge  of  the  conditions  therein,  and  after  several  attempts 
succeeded  in  recovering  the  body  of  Private  Ltjtle.  It  was  afterwards  found 
that  the  well  was  30  feet  deep  and  that  it  contained  18  feet  of  water.  The 
prompt  and  courageous  effort  on  the  part  of  Private  Mauchline  to  save  the 
life  of  a  comrade  under  such  adverse  conditions  constitutes  an  act  of  e.xeep- 
tional  heroism.

utter  disregard  of  his  own  personal  danger  Private  Medley  immediately 
reached  through  the  burning  gasoline,  shut  off  the  flow  of  gasoline  from  the 
tank  truck,  and  then  dragged  the  flaming  gasoline  container  from  under  the 
truck,  thus  preventing  an  explosion  that  would  undoubtedly  have  resulted

succeeded  in  working  his  way  over  the  fuselage  to  the  pilot's  cockpit,  released

Corporal,  Battery  A,  12th  Coast  Artillery,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  at  Fort  Monroe,  Va.,  Apr.  4,  1931.  When  an  explosion  occurred  on 
board  the  United  States  Public  Health  Service  boat  Heron,  setting  tiro  to  it, 
Corporal  Homps  acted  promptly  and  intelligently  in  organizing  and  directing 
the  removal  of  the  burning  boat  from  the  vicinity  of  the  wharf  to  which  it  was 
tied  up,  and  preventing  the  spread  of  fire  to  other  Government  boats  and 
property.  This  act  was  performed  in  the  face  of  the  grave  danger  of  further 
explosion  of  three  tanks  of  gasoline  on  board  the  Heron.  The  coolness  and  vig- 
orous action  of  Corporal  Romps  and  his  disregard  of  personal  danger  reflect 
great  credit  upon  himself  and  the  military  service.

and,  despite  the  excruciating  heat,  succeeded  in  removing  the  exposed  explo- 
sives to  a  place  of  safety.  Thereupon  they  extinguished  the  flames  and  brought 
a  dangerous  fire  under  control.  The  high  degree  of  heroism  displayed  by 
Corporal  Ross  on  this  occasion  contributed  to  the  saving  of  Government

an  attempt  to  rescue  his  passenger.  He  was  driven  back  by  the  intense  heat, 
but  returned  to  the  other  side,  and  after  repeated  and  determined  efforts,

save  the  boy's  life  as  the  tide  had  just  turned  flood.  Sergeant  Topper,  accom- 
panied by  two  comrades,  with  the  aid  of  planks  and  rope,  proceeded  out  into

vicinity  of  the  howitzer.  Sergeant  Tullos  and  the  other  members  of  the 
gun  squad,  with  utter  disregard  of  the  danger  of  an  explosion  from  shells  which

sives to  a  place  of  safety.  Thereupon  they  extinguished  the  flames  and  brought 
a  dangerous  fire  under  control.  The  high  degree  of  heroism  displayed  by 
Sergeant  Tullos  on  this  occasion  contributed  to  the  saving  of  Government

founded.

engineer,  took  a  line  from  the  Heron  and  towed  it  into  deep  water  away  from 
other  Government  vessels  and  property.  He  then  assisted  in  bringing  the 
yawl  alongside  the  burning  boat  and  removing  its  pilot  to  a  place  of  safety. 
His  courage  and  skillful  handling  of  the  yawl  in  the  face  of  the  grave  danger  of 
further  explosion  of  the  gasoline  tanks  on  board  the  Heron  reflect  great  credit 
upon  himself  and  the  military  service. 

IMajor,  Ordnance  Department,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  on  July  11,  1926.  during  the  explosions  at  the  Lake  Denmark  Naval 
Ammunition  Depot,  near  Dover,  N.  J.  Major  Zornig,  one  of  a  party  of  eight 
men,  entered  the  burning  area  at  6.30  a.  m.  to  search  for  First  Lt.  George  W.' 
Bott,  jr.,  United  States  Army,  who  was  known  to  have  been  in  the  powder 
factory  at  the  time  of  the  first  explosions  late  the  preceding  afternoon. 
Throughout  the  search  they  were  in  close  proxin'ity  to  burning  magazines 
and  exposed  to  frequent  explosions  of  large-caliber  shells  and  small-arms  ammu- 
nition. While  there  was  still  possibility  of  more  serious  detonations,  and  at  the 
risk  of  their  lives,  they  located  the  body  of  Lieutenant  Bott  and  with  great 
difficulty  succeeded  in  removing  it  from  the  wreckage  to  a  point  outside  the 
danger  zone. 

Corporal,  1st  Platoon,  Headquarters  Battery,  1st  Coast  Artillery,  U.  S.  Army.

1934.  An  observation  plane  piloted  by  Second  Lt.  Morris  Goldberg,  Air 
Corps,  and  containing  one  passenger,  crashed  into  a  harbor  defense  searchlight 
tower,  hung  to  the  tower  and  burst  into  flames.  Corporal  Zychoirnhi,  together 
with  a  companion,  at  imminent  danger  to  their  own  lives  from  explod  ng 
machine-gun  bullets  and  flaming  gasoline,  dashed  through  the  Oames  and 
rescued  Lieutenant  Goldberg  from  the  burning  airplane.

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 
For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from  Mitchel  Field,  Long 
Island,  N.  Y.,  to  Langley  Field,  Hampton,  y&amp;.,  on  Dec.  12,  1926.  While 
flying  at  an  altitude  of  1,000  feet  over  Rockaway  Beach,  Long  Island,  N.  Y., 
the  engine  in  Lieutenant  Aldworth's  airplane  instanteously  and  completely 
failed.  Efforts  to  start  the  engine  proving  to  no  avail,  and  being  fully  aware 
of  the  danger  to  himself,  Lieutenant  Aldworth,  disregarding  his  own  safety 
and  mindful  only  of  the  safety  of  the  crowds  on  the  beach,  displayed  excellent 
judgment  and  great  courage  when  he  maneuvered  his  airplane  to  avoid  the 
crowds  on  the  beach  and  crashed  into  the  breakers  offshore.  His  airplane 
turned  over  im.mrdiately  with  great  force  and  left  Lieutenant  Aldivorlh 
submerged  below  the  surface,  from  which  position  he  e.\tricated  himself  and 
was  assisted  ashore. 

First  lieutenant,  Air  Corps.  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  displayed  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  on  Dec.  14,  1934. 
kn  airplane  piloted  by  Lieutenant  Anderson  while  maneuvering  over  San 
Francisco,  Calif.,  caught  fire.  Directing  his  mechanic  to  jump  and  preparing 
himself  to  do  likewi.se.  Lieutenant  Anderson,  observing  that  he  w'as  directly 
over  the  city,  returned  to  the  cockpit,  despite  the  fact  that  it  was  almost 
completely  enveloped  in  flames,  piloted  the  burning  plane  away  from  the 
city  and  then  jumx)ed  from  the  plane  in  his  parachute  into  San  Francisco 
Bay.  The  parachute  submerged  and  he  was  in  grave  danger  of  drowning 
until  rescued  by  one  of  the  crew  of  the  U,  S.  S.  Oklahoma.  Had  Lieutenant 
Anderson  not  displayed  an  extraordinary  amount  of  courage,  coolness,  and 
disregard  for  his  own  self,  the  airplane  would  probably  have  crashed  in  a 
congested  part  of  the  city,  thus  possibly  causing  considerable  loss  of  life  and 
destruction  to  private  property. 

Captain,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Captain 
Anderson  wa^  scientific  observer  of  the  National  Gengraphic  ."Society- Army 
Air  Corps  Stratosphere  Balloon  Flight,  which  took  otT  from  the  vicinity  of 
Rapid  City,  S.  Dak.,  July  28,  19.34,  and  landed  near  Loomis,  Nebr.,  that  same 
date.  He  assisted  in  piloting  the  balloon  into  the  stratosphere  to  an  altitude 
of  60,613  feet,  and  in  making  continuous  scientific  observations  en  route,  and 
when  the  balloon  became  disabled  through  circumstances  beyond  human 
control,  did  attempt,  under  most  adverse  and  hazardous  conilitions,  to  land 
successfully  the  disabled  aircraft  in  order  to  preserve  the  scientific  records 
that  had  been  obtained.  By  the  exercise  of  cool  judgment  and  foresight  under 
these  conditions,  certain  scientific  records  were  saved  and  the  disabled  air- 
craft was  abandoned  only  when  it  was  clearly  evident  that  not  to  do  so  would 
prove  disastrous  to  human  life. 

Oak-Leaf  Clu.ster. 

Captain  Anderson  is  also  awarded  an  Oak-Leaf  Cluster  for  the  followfng  act  of 
extraordinary  achievement  as  pilot  and  assistant  scientific  observer  of  the 
National  Geographic  Society-Armj'  Air  Corps  Stratosphere  Balloon  Flight 
which  started  from  the  vicinity  of  Rapid  Citj',  S.  Dak.,  on  Nov.  11,  1935,  and 
successfully  landed  near  White  I&gt;ake,  S.  Dak.,  with  the  scientific  equipment 
and  the  valuable  records  it  contained  intact.  In  performing  this  flight, 
Captain  Anderson  distinguished  himself  by  extraordinary  achievement, 
coolness,  and  confidence  in  piloting  the  largest  and  the  most  heavily  equipped 
balloon  ever  flown  to  a  greater  height  than  had  previously  been  attained  by 
man. 

First  lieutenant,  .\ir  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  and  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial 
flight.  On  November  20.  19.35,  Lieutenant  Armstrong  (then  temporary  cap- 
tain) was  piloting  an  airplane  with  three  passengers  and  a  copilot,  from  David, 
Republic  of  Panama,  to  .\lbrook  Field.  Canal  Zone.  While  flying  at  an 
altitude  of  approximately  4.000  feet  over  jungle  and  mountainous  terrain,  the 
right  engine  of  the  airplane  disintegrated.  Lieutenant  Armslrnnij,  realizing 
the  possibility  of  the  remaining  motor  quitting  and  with  no  landing  area 
visible,  signalled  to  the  copilot  and  passengers  to  jump,  a  comparatively  safe 
proceeding  at  that  time.  Witti  the  airplane  thus  lightened  and  with  the 
assistance  of  the  copilot  who  did  not  jump  when  ordered  to,  I&gt;ieutenant 
Armstrong  then  piloted  tlie  airplane  to  a  safe  landing  on  a  distant  fiel&lt;i.  His 
courage  and  coolness  in  this  emergency  undoubtedly  resulted  in  saving  the 
lives  of  the  pas.sengers  and  by  preventing  a  crash  landing  saved  the  airplane 
from  destruction.

Lieutenant  colonel.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  as  pilot 
and  commanding  officer  of  a  bombardment  squadron  of  10  airplanes,  from 
Washington,  D.  C,  to  Fairbanks.  Alaska,  and  return,  from  July  19,  1934,  to 
Aug.  20,  1934.  By  his  untiring  energy,  fearless  leadership,  and  extraordinary 
professional  skill,  Lieutenant  Colonel  Arnold  organized,  directed,  and  com- 
pleted over  18,000  miles  of  exceptionally  dangerous  flying,  including  a  nonstop 
flight  from  Juneau,  Alaska,  to  Seattle,  Wash.,  a  distance  of  950  miles  over 
water,  under  extremely  adverse  weather  conditions,  without  the  loss  of  per- 
sonnel or  equipment,  to  demonstrate  successfully  the  mobility  of  the  Air 
Force  and  to  establish  new  records  for  the  Army  Air  Corps  in  aerial  photog- 
raphy and  long  distance  mass  formation  flying. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieu- 
tenant Benton,  as  one  of  the  pilots  of  the  airplane  Detroit  during  the  Pan 
Ameriran  flight  starting  on  Dec.  21, 192fi.  displayed  initiative,  resourcefulness, 
and  a  high  degree  of  skill  under  the  many  trying  conditions  encountered. 
Tireless  energy,  sound  judgment,  and  personal  courage  characterized  his  con- 
tribution to  the  success  of  the  expedition  until  Feb.  26,  1927,  when,  due  to  an 
accident  at  Buenos  Aires,  .\rgentina,  resulting  in  the  complete  destruction  of 
his  airplane,  he  made  the  supreme  sacrifice.  In  the  efficient  performance  of  his 
arduous  duties  he  aided  in  the  accomplishment  of  an  exploit  which  brought 
great  credit  to  himself  and  to  the  Army  of  the  United  States. 

Posthumously  awarded.   Medal  presented  to  widow,  Mrs.  Zelma  C.  Benton. 

American  civilian. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  July  28-30, 

1931.    Mr.  Boardman  achieved  a  5,011.8-mile  nonstop  trans- Atlantic  flight 

from  the  United  States  to  Istanbul,  Turkey. 

Master  sergeant,  68th  Service  Squadron,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  hr&gt;roism  while  participating  in  aerial  flights.  On  May  19, 1919,  at  McCook 
Field,  Dayton,  Ohio,  Sergeant  BoltrieU  made  the  first  jump  to  be  performed 
by  Army  personnel  with  a  manually  operated,  free-type  parachute.  At  that 
time  parachute  jumping  of  any  kind  was  considered  extremely  hazardous. 
In  spite  of  this.  Sergeant  BottrieU  repeatedly  jeopardized  his  life  while  making 
parachute  test  jumps  from  airplanes  flying  at  various  speeds  and  at  various 
altitudes  to  perfect  this  parachute.  By  hi.s  untiring  effort,  fearlessness,  and  dis- 
regard of  personal  danger,  Sergeant  BottrieU  aided  materially  in  proving  the 
free-type  parachute  not  only  possible  but  practical  for  airplane  use. 

Captain,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  aerial  flights.  By  his 
vision,  initiative,  courage,  and  perseverance.  Captain  Bruner  rendered  ex- 
ceptionally valuable  services  to  the  Government  of  the  United  States  by  de- 
veloping and  perfecting  night-flying  equipment,  thus  making  it  possible  for 
military  and  commercial  airplanes  to  traverse  the  length  and  breadth  of  the 
United  States  during  the  hours  of  darkness. 

Captain  (first  lieutenant),  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from  March  Field,  Calif.,  to 
Bakersfield,  Calif.,  Nov.  12,  1935.  While  piloting  a  C-14  airplane  carrying 
three  passengers,  Captain  Buckman  was  seized  by  an  excruciating  pain  in  the 
vicinity  of  his  heart,  when  he  was  approximately  50  miles  from  his  destination. 
Although  s'ldering  intensely,  Captain  Buckman  maintained  control  of  his 
ship  and  effected  a  safe  landing  at  Bakersfield  Airport,  Calif.,  where  he  col- 
lapsed and  died  shortly  afterward. 

Posthumously  awarded.  Medal  presented  to  widow,  Mrs.  Madeline  S.  Buck- 
man. 

Second  lieutenant.  Air  Corps  Re.serve,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieutenant  Caldwell, 
together  with  Lt.  Inin  A.  Woodring,  Air  Corps,  was  selected  to  carry  out 
secret  orders  given  by  the  War  Department  to  receive  a  document  of  inter- 
national importance  at  Vancouver,  Canada,  on  Oct.  15,  1930.  and  deliver  it 
to  representatives  of  the  State  Department  at  Newark,  New  Jersey,  not  later 
than  noon  October  18.  The  orders  given  to  the  pilots  stressed  the  necessity 
of  disregarding  the  ordinary  peacetime  precautions  in  order  to  pet  the  docu- 
ment to  its  destination  on  scheduled  time.  Extremely  hazardous  flying 
conditions  were  encountered  in  Wyoming,  snow  and  sleet  destroying  all 
visibility  from  the  ground  to  an  altitude  of  16,000  feet.  Although  the  airplanes 
being  used  in  the  flight  were  of  pursuit  type,  selected  for  speed,  and  not 
suitable  for  extensive  blind  flying,  and  the  pilots  reilized  the  dangcs  involved , 
they  were  determined  to  take  no  chances  in  .delaying  the  successful  accom- 
plishment of  their  mission.  Lientenant  Caldwe'l  remained  with  his  flight 
leader  until  the  total  lack  of  visibility  caused  a  separation  between  them,  and 
he  crashed  to  earth  at  2.15  p.m.,  October  15,  1930.  about  1' j  miles  east  of  Look- 
out, Albany  County,  Wyo.,  and  was  killed.  Lieutenant  Culdu-fll's  disregard 
of  danger  in  his  endeavor  to  carry  out  successfully  liis  important  mission  was 
in  accordance  with  the  best  traditions  of  the  Air  Corps  and  reflects  great 
credit  on  himself  and  the  United  States  Army. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  father,  F.  0.  Caldwell.

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from 
Concord,  N.  H.,  to  East  Brewster,  Mass.,  and  return,  on  the  night  of  Feb.  9, 
1936.  Havin;;  been  notified  that  seven  Civilian  Conservation  Corps  enrollees 
were  stranded  on  an  ice  floe  in  Cape  Cod  Bay,  Corporal  Connor  served  as  a 
member  of  the  crew  of  an  airplane  which  took  olT  during  the  hours  of  darkness, 
under  dangerous  flying  conditions  due  to  weather,  and  successfully  located 
the  men,  dropped  a  message  to  them,  and  reported  their  location,  thereby 
being  chiefly  responsible  for  saving  their  lives. 

Lieutenant,  French  Army  Reserves. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieu- 
tenant Costes  and  Lt.  Cmdr.  Joseph  Lebrix,  displaying  exceptional  skill, 
initiative,  and  resourcefulness,  made  an  extremely  hazardous  aerial  journey 
of  3.5,000  miles,  in  the  course  of  which  they  arrived  in  the  United  States  in 
February  1928,  by  air,  after  making  the  first  nonstop  flight  across  the  South 
Atlantic. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  and  extraordinary  achievement  displayed  while  piloting  a  Douglas 
amphibian  over  the  Canal  Zone,  on  May  31,  1934.  When  about  100  yards 
from  the  edge  of  Gatun  Lake,  at  an  altitude  of  approximately  1.400  feet, 
mechanical  failure  caused  a  portion  of  the  right  motor  to  penetrate  the  pilot's 
cockpit  with  such  force  that  the  copilot  was  fatally  injured  and  fell  across 
Lieutenant  Couslnnd  and  the  controls.  The  plane  started  into  a  spin,  but 
I..ieutenant  Cousland,  disregarding  his  own  serious  injuries  from  flying  glass, 
ordered  his  passengers  to  r?tain  their  seats  and  by  his  courage,  i&gt;resence  of 
mind,  and  complete  mastery  of  the  art  of  piloting,  maneuvered  the  disabled 
aircraft  to  a  safe  landing  on  the  surface  of  the  stump-studded  lake. 

Second  lieutenant.  Air  Service.  U   S.  Army.

1920,  Lieutenant  Crumrine  exhibited  a  splendid  spirit  of  cooperation,  per- 
severance, fortitude,  courase,  and  skill,  which  aided  materially  in  the  suc- 
cessful completion  of  this  pioneer  flight  to  Alaska. 

American  civilian. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  aerial  flights.  Over  a 
long  period  of  years,  Mr.  Curtiss,  by  his  initiative,  untiring  energy,  and  cour-

energy,  broad  vision,  and  technical  knowledge  assisted  materially  in  the  or- 
ganization of  this  important  expedition.  His  leadership,  skill,  sound  judg- 
ment, and  courageous  conduct  were  vital  factors  in  bringing  to  a  successful 
completion  this  mission  of  good  will.  In  the  excellent  performance  of  his

of  extraordinary  acliievement  while  participating  in  aerial  flights.  During 
March  1924,  at  McCook  Field,  Dayton,  Ohio,  Lieutenant  Dnolittle,  piloting  a 
Fokker  F\V-7  jiursuit  air[)lane,  performed  a  series  of  acceleration  tests  re- 
quiring skill,  initiative,  endurance,  and  courage  of  the  highest  type.  In  these 
tests  a  recording  accelerometer  was  mounted  in  the  airplane  and  the  accelera- 
tions taken  for  the  following  maneuvers:  Loops  at  various  air  speeds;  single 
and  multijile  barrel  rolls;  power  spirals;  tail  spins,  power  on  and  power  off; 
half  loop,  half  roll,  and  Immelman  turn;  inverted  flight;  pulling  out  of  dive  at 
various  air  speeds;  flying  the  air|)lanc  on  a  level  course  with  considerable  angle 
of  bank;  and  flying  in  bumpy  air.  In  these  tests  the  airplane  was  put  through 
the  most  extreme  maneuvers  possible  in  order  that  the  flight  loads  imposed 
upon  the  wings  of  the  airplane  under  extreme  conditions  of  air  combat  might 
be  ascertained.  These  tests  were  put  through  with  that  fine  combination  of 
fearlessness  and  skill  which  constitutes  the  essence  of  distinguished  flying. 
Through  them  scientific  data  of  great  and  permanent  importance  to  the  Air 
Corps  were  obtained.

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Captain 
Eaker,  as  one  of  the  pilots  of  the  airplane  San  Francisco  during  the  Pan  Amer- 
ican flight,  Dec.  21,  192'),  to  May  2, 1927,  displayed  initiative,  resourcefulness, 
and  a  high  degree  of  skill  under  the  many  trying  conditions  encountered 
throughout  the  flight.  His  tireless  energy,  sound  judgment,  and  personal 
courage  contributed  materially  to  the  successful  completion  of  this  mission  of 
good  will.  In  the  efficient  performance  of  his  arduous  duties  he  aided  in  the 
accomplishment  of  an  exploit  which  brought  great  credit  to  himself  and  to  the 
Army  nf  the  United  States. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

Captain  Eaker  is  also  awarded  an  Oak-Leaf  Cluster  for  an  act  of  extraordinary 
achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  On  Jan.  1-7,  1929,  he 
acted  as  relief  pilot  of  the  airplane  Question  Mark  on  the  refueling  flight,  at 
and  near  Los  Angeles,  Calif.,  which  remiined  in  the  air  a  total  of  150  hours  40 
minutes  and  15  seconds,  a  period  of  continuous  flight  longer  than  any  previous 
flight  ever  accomplished.  By  his  endurance,  resourcefulness,  and  determina- 
tion he  demonstrated  future  possibilities  in  aviation  which  were  heretofore  not 
appreciated,  and  thus  reflected  great  credit  upon  himself  and  the  Army  of  the 
United  States. 

First  lieutenant,  Air  Corps  Reserve,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieu- 
tenant Eielson  as  pilot,  accompanied  Capt.  George  H.  Wilkins  (an  English 
subject),  from  Point  Barrow,  Alaska,  to  Dead  Man's  Island,  Archipelago  of 
Spitzbergen,  on  Apr.  15-16,  1928,  without  stop,  a  distance  of  more  than  2,200 
miles.  The  severity  of  the  weather,  the  storm  area  through  which  they 
passed  with  no  hope  of  outside  aid  in  case  of  a  forced  landing,  and  the  complete 
success  of  the  enterprise  distinguish  this  as  one  of  the  most  extraordinary 
aerial  accomplishments  of  history. 

Master  sergeant.  Air  Service,  U.S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  As 
assistant  engineer  ofl^cer  and  chief  mechanic  of  the  Alaskan  Flying  Expedition 
in  a  flight  from  Mitchel  Field,  N.  Y.,  to  Nome,  Alaska,  and  return,  from  July 
15  to  Oct.  20,  1920,  Sergeant  English  exhibited  a  splendid  spirit  of  cooperation, 
perseverance,  fortitude,  courage,  and  skill,  which  aided  materially  in  the 
successful  completion  of  this  pioneer  flight  to  Alaska. 

Second  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  As  aide  to  First  Lt.  Paul 
Evert,  Air  Corps,  pilot,  during  the  National  Balloon  Race  starting  from  Bettis 
Field,  Pittsburgh,  Pa.,  on  May  30,  1928.  Their  balloon  was  struck  by  light- 
ning or  received  a  heavy  charge  of  electricity  during  a  severe  electrical  storm 
while  over  Youngwood,  Pa.,  at  an  altitude  of  approximately  1,200  feet,  in- 
stantly killing  the  pilot,  setting  the  balloon  on  fire,  and  severely  shocking  and 
partially  paralyzing  Lieutenant  Ent.  He  endeavored  to  revive  his  pilot,  not 
being  sure  that  he  had  been  killed,  but  was  unsuccessful,  .\lthough  the  bal- 
loon was  burning  and  slipping,  he  maneuvered  it  to  land  safely  without  injury 
to  private  property.  When  the  balloon  collapsed  about  20  feet  above  the 
ground  the  remaining  hydrogen  gas  burned  quickly,  destroying  the  envelope 
and  net.  Disregarding  his  own  personal  safety  and  with  great  devotion  to 
duty,  Lieutenant  Ent  stayed  with  the  balloon  at  the  risk  of  his  life  instead  of 
landing  with  his  parachute.  His  courage,  daring,  and  heroism  reflect  great 
credit  upon  himself  and  the  Army  of  the  United  States. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieu-

resourcefulness,  and  a  high  degree  of  skill  under  the  many  trying  conditions 
encountered  throughout  the  flight.  His  tireless  energy,  sound  judgment,  and 
personal  courage  contributed  materially  to  the  successful  completion  of  this 
mission  of  good  will.  In  the  efficient  performance  of  his  arduous  duties  he 
aided  in  the  accomplishment  of  an  exploit  which  brought  great  credit  to  him- 
self and  to  the  Army  of  the  United  States. 

Major,  (^hief  of  Irish  Free  State  Air  Force. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Major 
Fitzmaurice,  with  his  two  companions,  .\pr.  12-13,  1928,  by  their  exceptional

Major  (captain),  20th  Bombardment  Squadron,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievenscnt  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from 
Concord,  N.  II.,  to  East  Brewster,  Mass.,  and  return,  on  the  night  of  Feb.  9, 
1936.  Having  been  notified  that  seven  CiviUan  Conservation  Corps  enrollees 
were  stranded  on  an  ice  floe  in  Cape  Cod  Bay,  Major  Giles,  accompanied  by 
an  officer  and  two  enlisted  men,  took  off  in  an  airplane  during  the  hours  of 
darkness,  under  dangerous  Hying  conditions  due  to  weather,  and  successfully 
located  the  men,  dropped  a  message  to  them,  and  reported  their  location, 
thereby  being  chiefly  responsible  for  saving  their  lives. 

Second  lieutenant,  Air  Corps  Reserve,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  On 
Aug.  16-17,  1927,  Lieutenant  Goebcl  piloted  an  airplane  on  a  nonstop  flight 
from  Oakland,  Calif.,  to  Wheeler  Field,  Honolulu,  Territory  of  Hawaii,  a 
distance  of  2,400  miles,  in  25  hours  and  17  minutes.  By  his  skill,  resourceful- 
ness, and  courage  in  this  accomplishment  Lieutenant  Gnebel  demonstrated 
the  feasibility  of  airplane  communication  between  the  United  States  and  its 
Pacific  possessions,  reflecting  great  credit  upon  himself  and  the  Army  of  the 
United  States. 

Captain,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  aerial  flights.  On  Mar.  9,  1927,  Captain 
Gray  attempted  to  establish  the  world's  altitude  record  for  aircraft,  but  due 
to  faulty  oxygen  apparatus  he  fainted  at  an  altitude  of  27,000  feet,  recovering 
consciousness  after  52  minutes,  when  his  balloon,  having  overshot  its  equi- 
librium point,  descended  to  an  atmosphere  low  enough  to  sustain  life.  Un- 
daunted by  this  experience.  Captain  Gray,  on  May  4,  1927,  made  a  record 
attempt  when  he  attained  an  altitude  of  42,470  feet,  higher  than  any  other 
earth  creature  has  over  gone.  On  his  descent,  however,  his  balloon  failed  to 
parachute,  and  it  was  necessary  for  him  to  descend  from  8,000  feet  in  a  para- 
chute. Witli  faith  still  unshaken,  and  displaying  great  courage  and  self- 
reliance.  Captain  Gray,  on  Nov.  4,  1927,  made  the  third  attempt,  which 
resulted  in  his  making  the  supreme  sacrifice.  Having  attained  an  altitude 
of  42,000  feet  he  waited  for  10  minutes,  testing  his  reactions,  before  making  a 
last  rapid  climb  to  his  ceiling  and  a  more  rapid  descent  to  safe  atmosphere. 
Undoubtedly  his  courage  was  greater  than  his  supply  of  oxygen,  which  gave 
out  at  about  37,000  feet. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  widow,  Mrs.  Marion  M.  Gray. 

Captain.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from  Wright  Field,  Ohio, 
to  Indianapolis,  Ind.,  July  22,  1936.  While  making  a  carbon  monoxide  test 
flight  of  a  new  Army  airplane  at  an  altitude  of  2,000  feet,  the  engine  hurst 
into  flames  and  smoke.  Captain  Griffith,  the  copilot,  and  tlie  pilot,  without 
thought  of  themselves  directed  the  crew  of  observers  to  jump  and  then  by 
switching  gas  valves  and  using  fire  extinguishers  succeeded  in  extinguishing 
the  fire,  thereby  preventing  not  only  possible  loss  of  life  but  destruction  to 
valuable  Government  property. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.S  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  On  Jan. 
1-7,  1929,  Lieutenant  Halverson,  with  Second  Lt.  Ehrond  R.  Quesada,  Air 
Corps,  acted  as  relief  pilot  of  the  airplane  Question  T^Iark  on  the  refueling 
flight,  at  and  near  Los  Angeles,  Calif.,  which  remained  in  the  air  a  total  of 
150  hours,  40  minutes,  and  15  seconds,  a  period  of  continuous  flight  longer 
than  any  previous  flight  ever  accomplished.  By  their  endurance,  resource- 
fulness, and  determination  they  demonstrated  future  possibilities  in  aviation 
which  were  heretofore  not  appreciated,  and  thus  reflected  great  credit  upon

cord, N.  H.,  to  East  Brewster,  Mass.,  and  return,  on  the  night  of  Feb.  9, 
19.36.  Having  been  notified  that  seven  Civilian  Conservation  Corps  enrollees 
were  stranded  on  an  ice  floe  in  Cape  Cod  Bay,  Staff  Sergeant  Hamilton 
served  as  a  member  of  the  crew  of  an  airplane  which  took  off  during  the  hours 
of  darkness,  under  dangerous  flying  conditions  due  to  weather,  and  success- 
fully located  the  men,  dropped  a  message  to  them,  and  reported  their  location, 
thereby  being  chiefly  responsible  for  saving  their  lives.

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  As  assist- 
ant pilot  and  navigator  of  a  United  States  Army  airplane,  by  his  riiasterly 
skill,  courage,  endurance,  and  tenacity  of  purpose,  with  his  pilot.  Lieutenant 
Hegenberger  successfully  navigated  his  airplane  on  June  28-29,  1927,  from  Oak- 
land, Calif.,  to  Honolulu,  Territory  of  Hawaii,  over  the  greatest  expanse  of 
open  sea  yet  crossed  in  a  nonstop  flight.  Lieutenant  Ilegenberger,  with  full 
knowledge  of  the  dangers  and  difficulties  traversed  over  2,400  miles  of  the 
Pacific  Ocean  with  marvelous  accuracy  of  direction,  and  thereby  demon- 
strated conclusively  the  practicability  of  accurate  aerial  navigation.  His 
masterful  exploit  is  worthy  of  the  greatest  praise  and  has  bestowed  much 
credit  on  the  United  States  Army. 

Captain,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

Captain  Hegenberger  is  also  awarded  an  Oak-Leaf  Cluster  for  an  act  of  extraor- 
dinary achievement  while  participating  in  aerial  flights.  By  his  initiative, 
energy,  and  courage.  Captain  Hegenberger  rendered  exceptionally  valuable 
services  to  the  Government  of  the  United  States  in  the  execution  of  a  series 
of  aerial  flights  culminating  with  a  solo  instrument  flight  and  landing  on  May 
9,  1932,  in  connection  with  the  testing  and  development  of  the  Air  Corps  Sys- 
tem of  Instrument  Flying  and  Landing. 

Staff  sergeant.  Air  Corps,  U.S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  On  Jan. 
1-7,  1929,  Sergeant  Hooe  acted  as  mechanic  of  the  airplane  Question  Mark  on 
the  refueling  flight,  at  and  near  Los  Angeles,  Calif.,  which  remained  in  the 
air  a  total  of  150  hours,  40  minutes,  and  15  seconds,  a  period  of  continuous 
flight  longer  than  any  previous  flight  ever  accomplished.  By  his  endurance,

Captain,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from  Wright  Field,  Ohio,  to 
Indianapolis,  Ind.,  July  22,  1936.  While  making  a  carbon  monoxide  test 
flisfht  of  a  new  Army  airplane  at  an  altitude  of  2,000  feet,  the  engine  hurst

fire,  thereby  preventing  not  only  possible  loss  of  life  but  destruction  to  val- 
uable Government  property. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from  Luke  Field,  Territory 
of  Hawaii,  to  Hilo,  Island  of  Hawaii,  on  May  14,  1930.  Lieutenant  Jones 
was  flight  leader  of  3  Loening  amphibian  pianos  which  were  part  of  a  flight 
of  16  planes  engaged  in  a  tactical  training  flight,  and  was  accompanied  by  Lt. 
Walter  T.  Meyer,  radio  operator.  At  about  11:07  a.  m.,  one  of  the  bombing 
planes  fell  out  of  control  at  an  altitude  of  about  8,000  feet,  and  the  crew  were 
forced  to  take  to  their  parachutes,  landing  in  a  rough  sea.  At  the  time  of 
the  accident  and  throughout  the  day  a  very  strong  wind  was  blowing,  whip- 
ping up  the  waves  to  a  dangerous  height.  After  Lieutenant  Meyer  had  sent 
out  a  radio  SOS  call  telling  of  the  accident,  Lieutenant  Jones  landed  his 
plane  in  an  attempt  to  rescue  the  men  in  the  water.  Owing  to  the  force  of 
the  wind  and  waves,  and  a  missing  motor  which  finally  stopped,  they  were 
unsuccessful  in  their  efforts  to  maneuver  their  plane.  However,  by  landing 
in  close  proximity  to  the  men  in  the  water  the  crew  of  a  Navy  flying  boat  was 
able  to  see  the  men  and  eftect  their  rescue.  Lieutenant  Jones  was  not  rescued 
from  his  plane  until  about  1  a.  m..  May  15, 1930. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Service,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieuten- 
ant Ke.tly  with  First  Lt.  Jolin  A.  Macready,  departed  from  Mitchel  Field, 
Long  I.sland,  N  Y.,  at  12:36  p.  m..  May  2,  1923,  in  the  Army  transport  air- 
plane T-2,  on  a  nonstop  transcontinental  flight.  They  cncountcreil  practi- 
CPlly  every  hazard  of  flying  and  displayed  remarkable  ingenuily,  skill,  and 
persnveranco  in  overcoming  the  many  handicaps  imposed  upoi&gt;  thein  by 
the  elements  and  the  mechanical  equipment  used  by  tlicin.  They  arrived 
at  Rockwell  Field,  Coronado,  Calif.,  at  12:26  p.  m..  May  3,  1923,  thus  success- 
fully completing  the  first  transccntinental  nonstop  flight  in  the  history  of 
aviation. 

Major,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Major 
Kepner  was  pilot  and  commander  of  the  National  Geographic  Society — 
Army  Air  Corps  Stratosphere  Balloon  Flight,  which  took  off  from  the  vicinity 
of  Rapid  City,  S.  Dak.,  July  28,  19.34,  and  landed  near  Loomis,  Nebr.,  that 
same  date.  He  assisted  in  piloting  the  balloon  into  the  stratosphere  to  an 
altitude  of  60,613  feet  and  in  making  continuous  scicniine  observations  en 
route,  and  when  the  balloon  became  disabled  through  circumstances  beyond 
human  control,  did  attempt,  under  most  adverse  and  hazardous  conditions, 
to  land  successfully  the  disabled  aircraft  in  order  to  preserve  the  scientific 
records  that  had  been  obtained.  By  the  exercise  of  cool  judgment  and  fore- 
sight under  these  conditions,  certain  scientific  records  were  saved  and  the 
disabled  aircraft  was  abandoned  only  when  it  was  clearly  evident  that  not  to 
do  so  would  prove  disastrous  to  human  life.

crossed  in  a  nonstop  flight.  Lieutenant  Maitland,  with  full  knowledge  of  the 
dangers  and  difficulties,  traversed  over  2,400  miles  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  with 
marvelous  accuracy  of  direction,  and  thereby  demonstrated  conclusively  the

of  the  greatest  praise  and  has  bestowed  much  credit  on  the  United  States 
Army.

First  lieutenant.  First  Pursuit  Group,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  on  Feb.  7,  1923.  Lieutenant 
Meredith,  upon  learning  that  an  injured  man  was  lying  at  the  point  of  death 
on  Beaver  Island  in  Lake  Michigan,  voluntarily  made  a  hazardous  flight 
from  Selfridge  Field.  Mich.,  for  the  purpose  of  taking  medical  aid  to  the 
patient,  no  other  means  of  transportation  being  possible  owing  to  the  frozen 
condition  of  the  lake.  Extremely  dangerous  flying  conditions  were  encoun- 
tered, blinding  snow  and  nist  destroying  the  visibility,  thus  making  it  neces- 
sary to  land  along  the  shore  in  order  to  determine  the  location  of  the  island. 
In  so  doing  it  was  discovered  that  the  compass  had  an  error  and  tl;e  supply 
of  gasoline  was  limited.  However,  due  to  the  urgency  of  the  mission.  Lieu- 
tenant Meredith  continued  the  flight,  thus  enabling  a  doctor  to  reach  the 
patient  in  time  to  be  of  service. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from  Luke  Field,  Territory 
of  Hawaii,  to  Hilo,  Island  of  Hawaii,  on  May  14,  1930.  Lieutenant  Meyer, 
accompanying  Lt.  Vlysses  0.  Jones  in  a  Loening  amphibian  plane,  was 
radio  officer  of  3  amphibians  which  were  part  of  the  group  flight  of  16  planes 
engaged  in  a  tactical  training  flight.  At  about  11:07  a.  ra.  one  of  the  bombing 
planes  fell  out  of  control  at  an  altitude  of  about  8,000  feet,  and  the  crew  were 
forced  to  take  to  their  parachutes,  landing  in  the  rough  sea.  At  the  time  of 
the  accident  and  throughout  the  day  a  very  strong  wind  was  blowing,  whip- 
ping up  the  waves  to  a  dangerous  height.  After  Lieutenant  Meyer  had  sent 
out  a  radio  SOS  call  telling  of  the  accident.  Lieutenant  Jones  landed  his 
plane  in  an  attempt  to  rescue  the  men  in  the  water.  With  disregard  for  his 
own  personal  safety  Lieutenant  Meyer  risked  his  life  by  going  out  on  the 
end  of  the  lower  right  wing,  which  was  at  times  submerged,  in  an  attempt 
to  rescue  one  of  the  men  from  the  water.  Owing  to  the  force  of  the  wind 
and  waves,  and  a  missing  motor  which  finally  stopped,  they  were  unsuccess- 
ful in  their  efforts  to  maneuver  their  plane.  However,  by  landing  in  close 
proximity  to  the  men  in  the  water  the  crew  of  a  Navy  flying  boat  was  able 
to  see  the  men  and  effect  their  rescue.  Lieutenant  Meyer  stayed  with  his 
plane  until  rescued  about  1:30  a.  m.,  May  15,  1930,  endangering  his  life  re- 
peatedly during  the  last  hour,  trying  to  secure  tow  ropes,  thrown  from  a 
naval  aircraft  tender,  in  an  attempt  to  save  his  plane.

First  lieutenant,  Air  Corps,  XT.  s.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  In  an  aerial  flight  near  the  Wayne  County 
Airport,  Romulus,  Mich.  On  Aug.  23,  1931,  while  leading  a  formation  flight, 
the  airplane  of  a  formation-mate,  flying  on  his  flank,  was  thrown  hy  a  terrific 
air  current  into  the  airplane  piloted  hy  Lieutenant  Afcor,  disabling  the  tail 
group  of  the  latter's  airplane  and  causing  it  to  become  almost  entirely  un- 
controllable. Ignoring  the  opportunity  to  jump  from  the  airplane  and  save 
himself,  Lieutenant  j\loor  endeavored  first  to  save  his  passenger  and  repeatedly 
ordered  him  to  jump.  The  passenger  eventually  jumped  and  landed  safely 
with  parachute,  but  in  so  doing  unbalanced  the  airplane  which  immediately 
fell  out  of  control,  crashed  to  the  ground,  and  burst  into  flames,  resulting  in 
Lieutenant  Monr's  death  and  the  destruction  of  the  airplane.  The  circum- 
stances under  which  Lieutenant  ^A/oor  sacrificed  his  life  in  an  effort  to  save  the 
life  of  his  companion  furnish  an  outstanding  example  of  the  loyalty  and  the 
heroism  which  characterize  the  traditions  of  the  military  service. 

Posthumously  awarded.    Medal  presented  to  daughter,  Katherine  A.  Moor. 

Sergeant,  2d  Balloon  Company,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  \rmy. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  at  Pope  Field,  Fort  Bragg, 
N.  C,  on  the  night  of  Dec.  3-4,  1931.  During  a  severe  wind  and  rainstorm 
the  Army  dirigible  TC-71  broke  from  its  moorings  while  preparations  were 
being  made  by  the  crew  to  start  the  engines  and  cast  it  off  to  ride  out  the 
storm.  Sereeant  Neff  succeeded  in  getting  the  right  motor  started  but  was 
unable  to  start  the  left  motor  from  within  the  car.  Realizins  that  the  airship 
was  not  under  full  control  and  in  great  danger  of  being  wrecked  and  the  crew 
injured,  he  immediately  discarded  his  parachute  and  with  complete  disregard 
of  his  own  safety,  climbed  out  of  the  car  upon  the  unprotected  outrigger  of 
the  wildly  plunging  dirigible  and,  working  in  the  darkness  in  this  perilous 
position,  "succeeded  in  hand-cranking  the  left  motor,  thereby  bringing  the 
airship  under  full  engine  control.  Sergeant  Neff's  heroic  action  in  risking  his 
life  to  save  the  airship  from  destruction  and  the  crew  from  injury  was  in  ac- 
cordance with  the  best  traditions  of  the  Air  Corps  and  reflects  great  credit 
upon  himself  and  the  military  service. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Service,  U.  S.  Army.

were  stranded  on  an  ice  floe  in  Cape  Cod  Bay,  Lieutenant  Patrick  together 
with  another  officer  and  two  enlisted  men  took  off  in  an  airplane  during  the 
hours  of  darkness,  under  dangerous  flying  conditions  due  to  weather,  and 
successfully  located  the  men,  dropped  a  message  to  them,  and  reported  their 
location,  thereby  being  chiefly  responsible  for  saving  their  lives.

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  On 
Jan.  1-7,  1920,  Lieutenant  Quesada,  with  First  Lt.  Harry  A.  Haherson,  Air 
Corps,  acted  as  relief  pilot  of  the  airplane  Question  Mark  on  the  refueling  flight, 
at  and  near  Los  Angeles,  Calif.,  which  remained  in  the  air  a  total  of  150  hours, 
40  minutes,  and  15  seconds,  a  period  of  continuous  flight  longer  than  any  pre- 
vious flight  ever  accomplished.  By  their  endurance,  resourcefulness,  and 
determination  they  demonstrated  future  possibilities  in  aviation  which  were 
heretofore  not  appreciated,  and  thus  reflected  great  credit  upon  themselves 
and  the  Army  of  the  United  States. 

Second  lieutenant,  Air  Corps  Reserve,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from  Luke  Field,  Territory 
of  Hawaii,  to  Ililo,  Lsland  of  Hawaii,  on  May  14,  1930.  Lieutenant  Bavlings 
was  pilot  of  a  Loening  amphibian  plane,  flying  number  three  position  in  the 
flight  of  3  amphibians  which  were  part  of  a  group  flight  of  16  planes  engaged 
in  a  tactical  training  flight.  At  about  11 .07  a.  m.,  one  of  the  bombing  planes 
fell  out  of  control  at  an  altitude  of  about  8,000  feet,  and  the  crew  were  forced 
to  take  to  their  parachutes,  landing  in  the  rough  sea.  At  the  time  of  the 
accident  and  throughout  the  day  a  very  strong  wind  was  blowing,  whipping 
up  the  waves  to  a  dangerous  height.  With  disregard  for  his  own  personal 
safety  Lieutenant  Rawlings  landed  his  plane  in  close  proximity  to  the  men  in 
the  water  in  an  attempt  to  effect  their  rescue,  but  owing  to  the  high  wind  and 
waves,  and  a  missing  motor,  he  was  unable  to  maneuver  his  plane  after  land- 
ing. However,  by  his  prompt  action  the  crew  of  a  Navy  flying  boat  was  able 
to  see  the  men  in  the  water  and  effect  their  rescue.  Lieutenant  Rawlings  and 
his  mechanic  were  not  rescued  from  their  plane  until  about  7  p.  m.,  that  day.

1923,  they  piloted  an  airplane  refueled  in  flight  for  37  hours,  15  minutes,  14^ 
seconds,  breaking  the  endurance  record,  the  speed  records  from  2,500  to  5,000 
kilometers  and  the  distance  record  (5,300  kilorreters).  By  their  endurance, 
resourcefulness,  and  determination  they  reflected  great  credit  on  themselves 
and  the  Army  of  the  United  States.

Captain,  Air  Corps,  V.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Captain 
Stevens  was  scientific  observer  of  the  National  Geographic  Society — Army 
Air  Corps  Stratosphere  Balloon  Flight,  which  took  off  from  the  vicinity  of 
Rapid  City,  S.  Dak.,  July  28,  1934,  and  landed  near  Loomis,  Nebr.,  that 
same  date.  He  assisted  in  piloting  the  balloon  into  the  stratosphere  to  an 
altitude  of  60,613  feet,  and  in  making  continuous  scientific  observations  en 
route,  and  when  the  balloon  became  disabled  through  circumstances  beyond 
human  control,  did  attempt,  under  most  adverse  and  hazardous  conditions, 
to  land  successfully  the  disabled  aircraft  in  order  to  preserve  the  scientific 
records  that  had  been  obtained.  By  the  exercise  of  cool  judgment  and  fore- 
sight under  these  conditions,  certain  scientific  records  were  .saved  and  the 
disabled  aircraft  was  abandoned  only  when  it  was  clearly  evident  that  not  to 
do  so  would  prove  disastrous  to  human  life. 

Oak-Leaf  Cluster. 

Captain  Stevens  is  also  awarded  an  Oak-Leaf  Cluster  for  an  act  of  extraordinary 
achievement  as  commander  and  scientific  observer  of  the  National  Geo- 
graphic Society — Army  Air  Corps  Stratosphere  Balloon  Flight  which  started 
from  the  vicinity  of  Rapid  City,  S.  Dak.,  on  Nov.  11,  1935,  ascended  to  the 
greatest  height  ever  attained  by  man,  and  successfully  landed  near  White 
Lake,  S.  Dak.,  with  the  scientific  equipment  and  the  valuable  records  it 
contained  intact.  Captain  Stevens  disnlayed  a  steadfastness  of  purnose.  a 
thoroughness  of  preparation,  and  professional  attainments  of  the  highest 
character  in  the  execution  of  this  flight.  To  his  scientific  knowledge  may  be 
attributed  in  large  measure  the  acquisition  of  valuable  data  regarding  the 
realm  of  the  stratosphere. 

First  lieutenant,  Air  Service,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  As 
flight  commander  and  pilot  of  one  of  the  planes  of  the  .Maskan  Flying  Expedi- 
tion in  a  flight  from  Mitchel  Field,  N.  Y.,  to  Nome,  Alaska,  and  return, 
from  July  15  to  Oct.  20,  1920,  Lieutenant  Slreett  exhibited  expert  leadership, 
perseverance,  fortitude,  and  courage,  and  much  credit  is  due  him  for  the 
successful  completion  of  this  pioneer  flight  to  Alaska. 

StafT  sergeant,  4th  Observation  Squadron,  Air  Corps,  V.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight  from  Luke  Field,  Territory 
of  Hawaii,  to  Hilo,  Island  of  Hawaii,  on  May  14,  1930.  Sergeant  Summen 
was  mechanic  in  a  Loening  amphibian  plane  piloted  by  Lt.  Edwin  W.  Raw- 
lings,  flying  number  three  position  in  the  flight  of  3  amphibians  which  were 
part  of  a  flight  of  16  planes  engaged  in  a  tactical  training  flight.  At  about 
11.07  a.  m.,  one  of  the  bombing  planes  fell  out  of  control  at  an  altitude  of  about 
8,000  feet,  and  the  crew  werf  forced  to  take  to  their  parachutes,  landing  in  the 
rough  sea.  At  the  time  of  the  accident  and  throughout  the  day  a  very  strong 
wind  was  blowing,  whipping  up  the  waves  to  a  dangerous  height.  After  his 
pilot  had  landed  his  plane  in  an  attempt  to  r3seue  the  crew.  Sergeant  Summers 
worked  tirelessly  on  the  motor,  which  was  missing  bailly,  attempting  to  keep 
it  going  so  that  the  plane  could  be  maneuvered  to  the  vicinity  of  the  personnel 
in  the  water.  Although  unsuccessful  in  their  attempt  to  efifect  the  rescue  by 
their  landing  in  close  proximity  to  the  men  in  the  water  the  crew  of  a  Navy 
flying  boat  was  able  to  see  the  men  and  elTect  their  rescue.  Sergeant  Summers 
and  his  pilot  were  not  rescued  from  their  plane  until  about  7  p.  m.,  that  day. 

First  lieutenant,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Between

great  persom!  hazard  piloted  an  0-J  airplane  in  tests  to  determine  the  spinning 
characteristics  of  this  type  of  plane,  which  resulted  in  invaluable  data  being 
made  available  to  airplane  designers.  This  test  was  voluntary  and  above  the 
call  of  duty  and  reflected  great  credit  on  the  Air  Corps  and  the  Army  of  the 
United  States. 

First  lieutenant,  Air  Corps,  V.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieu-

First  lieutenant,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  On  Nov.  20,  1935,  Lieuten- 
ant Wallace  (then  temporary  captain)  served  as  copilot  on  an  airplane  travel- 
ing from  David,  Republic  of  Panama,  to  Albrook  Field,  Canal  Zone.  While 
flying  at  an  altitude  of  approximately  4,000  feet  over  jungle  and  mountainous 
terrain,  the  right  engine  of  the  airplane  disintegrated.  The  pilot,  realizing  the 
possibility  of  the  remaining  motor  quitting  and  with  no  landine  area  visible, 
signaled  to  the  copilot  and  passengers  to  jump.  Lieutenant  W^allace  directed 
the  passengers  to  jump  but  he  remained  and  assisted  the  pilot  in  making  a 
safe  landing.  Lieutenant  Wallace's  courage  and  coolness  in  this  emergency 
undoubtedly  resulted  in  saving  the  lives  of  the  passengers  and  preventing  a 
crash  landing. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieu- 
tenant Weddington,  as  one  of  the  pilots  of  the  airplane  St.  Louis  during  the 
Pan  American  flight,  Dec.  21,  1926,  to  May  2,  1927,  displayed  initiative,  re- 
sourcefulness, and  a  high  degree  of  skill  under  the  many  "trying  conditions 
encountered  throughout  the  flight.  His  tireless  energy,  sound  judgment,  and 
personal  courage  contributed  materially  to  the  successful  completion  of  the 
mission  of  good  will.  In  the  efficient  performance  of  his  arduous  duties  he 
aided  in  the  accomplishment  of  an  exploit  which  brought  great  credit  to  him- 
self and  to  the  Army  of  the  United  States. 

First  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieu- 
tenant Whitehead,  as  one  of  the  pilots  of  the  airplane  New  York  during  the  Pan 
American  flight,  Dec.  21,  1926,  to  May  2,  1927,  displayed  initiative,  resource- 
fulness, and  a  high  degree  of  skill  under  the  many  trying  conditions  encoun- 
tered throughout  the  flight.  His  tireless  energy,  sound  judgment,  and  per- 
sonal courage  contributed  materially  to  the  successful  completion  of  this

self and  to  the  Army  of  the  United  States. 

Second  lieutenant.  Air  Corps,  LT.  S.  Army. 

For  heroism  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Lieutenant  Woodring, 
as  flight  leader,  accompanied  by  Lt.  William  W.  Caldwell .  Air  Corps  Reserve, 
flying  P-12C  airplanes,  left  Rockwell  Field  October  11  under  secret  'Wax 
Department  orders  for  the  purpose  of  receiving  a  document  of  international 
importance  at  Vancouver,  Canada,  on  Oct.  15  and  delivering  it  to  an  agent 
of  the  State  Department  at  Newark,  N.  J.,  not  later  than  noon  of  Oct.  18, 
1930.  The  orders  given  the  two  pilots  stressed  the  necessity  of  disregarding  ordi- 
nary peacetime  precautions  to  get  the  document  through  on  scheduled  time. 
Extremely  hazardous  flying  conditions  were  encountered  in  Wyoming,  snow 
and  clouds  completely  destroying  visibility  from  the  ground  to  an  altitude  o( 
16,000  feet.  Although  the  airplanes  being  used  in  the  flight  were  of  pursuit 
type,  selected  for  speed,  and  not  suitable  for  extensive  blind  flying,  and  the 
pilots  realized  the  dangers  involved,  they  were  determined  to  take  no  chances 
in  delaying  the  successful  accomplishment  of  their  mission.  Lieutenant 
Caldwell,  blinded  by  the  storm,  crashed  to  his  death.  Lieutenant  Woodring 
arrived  at  Newark  at  7  p.  m.,  Oct.  16,  1930.  and  delivered  the  document. 
The  successful  accomplishment  of  this  mission  in  the  face  of  extreme  danger 
reflects  great  credit  not  only  upon  himself  but  also  upon  the  United  States 
Army. 

Captain,  Air  Corps,  U.  S.  Army. 

For  extraordinary  achievement  while  participating  in  an  aerial  flight.  Captain 
Woolsey,  as  one  of  the  pilots  of  the  airplane  Detroit,  during  the  Pan  American 
flight  starting  on  Dec.  21, 1926,  displayed  initiative,  resourcefulness,  and  a  high 
degree  of  skill  under  the  many  trying  conditions  encountered.  Tireless 
energy,  sound  judgment,  and  personal  courage  characterized  his  contribution 
to  the  success  of  the  expedition  until  Feb.  26,  1927,  when  due  to  an  accident  at 
Buenos  Aires,  Argentina,  resulting  in  the  complete  destruction  of  his  airplane, 
he  made  the  supreme  sacrifice.  In  the  efficient  performance  of  his  arduous 
duties  he  aided  in  the  accomplishment  of  an  exploit  which  brought  great 
credit  to  himself  and  to  the  Army  of  the  United  States.
