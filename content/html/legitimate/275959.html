<h1>RefControl</h1>

<div>RefControl is an extension for <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>
that lets you control what gets sent as the HTTP 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.36">Referer</a>
on a per-site basis.
</div>

<div>This can be useful in a number of situations:
<ul>
	<li><b>Privacy</b> - Perhaps you think webmasters don't have any business knowing
		where you found the link to their site.  You can configure RefControl to not
		send the referrer to any site except for ones you explicitly list.
	</li>
	<li><b>Broken sites</b> - Some sites perform misguided referrer checks in the name of
		"security".  These checks don't add any real security since the referrer is easily
		faked and can often 
		<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141641">cause problems</a>
		when the browser's behavior changes.  You can configure RefControl to send these
		sites whatever they are expecting and work around this kind of problem.
	</li>
	<li><b>Fun</b> - Send humorous things, secure in the knowledge that they are being
		written into the server's log file for the amusement of anyone who might later
		discover them there.  Ok, maybe that's not much fun, but RefControl will let you
		do it anyway.
	</li>
</ul>

<div><a name="help"><b>Instructions</b>:</a><br />
<div>
You create a list of sites, and the referrer that should be sent for each site.
To adjust settings for a single site, use the name of that site in the list
(for instance <b>www.example.com</b>).
</div>

<div>If you use <b>example.com</b> in the site list then the
action will apply to all sites in the example.com domain (mail.example.com, images.example.com, etc.).
More specific items in the list take precedence.  Assume the following settings:
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
	<tr><th>Site</th>				<th>Action</th></tr>
	<tr><td>example.com</td>		<td><b>&lt;Block&gt;</b></td></tr>
	<tr><td>www.example.com</td>	<td><b>&lt;Forge&gt;</b></td></tr>
</table>
Then the referrer will be forged for requests to www.example.com and it will be blocked for 
requests to all other example.com sites.
</div>

<div>For the referrer, the following options are available:
<ul>
	<li><b>Normal</b> - send the referrer as it would normally be sent without interference from RefControl.</li>
	<li><b>Block</b> - send no referrer to this site.</li>
	<li><b>Forge</b> - send the root of the site as the referrer.  In the above screenshot, all pages from
		<b>www.example.net</b> will use <b>http://www.example.net/</b> as the referrer.</li>
	<li><b>Custom</b> - type in any string and RefControl will use that as the referrer.  You can use 
		<a href="variables.html">variables</a> in this string.</li>
</ul>
There is also a checkbox <b>3rd Party requests only</b>.  If this box is checked,
the option selected above will take effect only for 3rd Party requests
(when the site is not the same as the referring site).  Examples:<br /><br />
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" width="100%">
	<tr><th>Page With Link</th>				<th>Page Linked To</th>						<th>3rd Party Request?</th></tr>
	<tr><td>http://www.example.com/</td>	<td>http://www.example.net/</td>			<td>Yes</td></tr>
	<tr><td>http://www.example.com/</td>	<td>http://images.example.com/</td>			<td>Yes</td></tr>
	<tr><td>http://www.example.net/</td>	<td>http://www.example.net/page2.html</td>	<td>No</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<div>
Additionally, you can specify the default behavior for any site not in the list.  You can set
this to something other than <b>Normal</b> if you want to be more protective about your privacy.
Setting it to <b>Block</b> for <b>3rd Party requests only</b> is a fairly good compromise between
privacy and not breaking sites.
If you change the default behavior and then want a site to get sent the actual referrer, 
add it to the list and set it to <b>Normal</b>.
</div>
</div>

<div><b>Testing</b>:<br />
<div>
There's a <a href="/cgi-bin/ref.cgi">test page</a> which will display the referrer
that was sent by your browser.  You can use this to test your installation and settings.
</div>

<div>If you want to see the referrer that Firefox sent for a page, you can enable the
status bar display.  There are two options:
<ul>
	<li><b>None</b> - Nothing will appear in the statusbar at all.</li>
	<li><b>Referer</b> - The Referer will be displayed directly in the status bar,
		possibly trimmed if it is long.
		Hovering over this with the mouse will show the full Referer in a tooltip.</li>
</ul>
If you'd rather not use the status bar display, you can also right click on the page and select
"View Page Info".  Then, on the General tab, look for Referring URL.
