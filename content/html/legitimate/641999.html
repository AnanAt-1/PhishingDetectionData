<h1><b>Early Missionaries of Madawaska Territory</b> </h1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Prior to the arrival of Acadians in the upper St.John River valley, French 
  missionaries consciously worked to convert the Maliseets and other first nations 
  in the Maritimes region to Roman Catholicism. </P>
<P>The Bishop of Qu&eacute;bec, Joseph-Octave Plessis, noted that the Maliseets 
  living at Madawaska had requested Father Adrien Leclerc of L'Isle Verte to visit 
  them once a year. Beginning in 1786, Leclerc spent several weeks each summer 
  with them, as did his successor, Joseph P&acirc;quet. Maliseets from other villages 
  would come to Madawaska at these times.</P>
<P>Plessis notes, however, that as more and more Acadians and Canadians established 
  themselves around the Maliseet village at Madawaska, the Maliseet moved away:</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The cur&eacute;s of Saint-Andr&eacute; (Kamouraska), Monseigneurs Amiot, 
    V&eacute;zina, Dorval, who were charged, after the priests from L'Isle Verte, 
    with serving this mission, ended up no longer finding any Indians, but rather 
    French who already numbered 24 families in 1792, when they addressed the Bishop 
    of Quebec for permission to build a chapel. <span class="s08">[<a href="../aroostook/sources.htm#plessis">Plessis</a>, 
    p.124]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<P>Indeed, it appears that the Church was purposely encouraging the Maliseet to 
  settle down in Tobique.&nbsp; John Jennings, in his history of the Catholic 
  Church in New Brunswick, notes that Father Fran&ccedil;ois Ciquard, assigned 
  to the mission from 1794 to 1798, wrote to the Bishop of Qu&eacute;bec:</P>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Ciquard reported his effort to deal with two difficulties associated with 
    the Maliseet missions, the mobility of the population and the effects of alcohol.&nbsp; 
    Father Ciquard's approach was to try to settle the Maliseet at Tobique and 
    insist that he would serve them only there or at Madawaska.</p>
  <p>Ciquard reported that shortly after his arrival in the colony, he had discussed 
    the question of the settlement of the Maliseets with the governor in Fredericton, 
    Thomas Carleton.&nbsp; He indicated that both he and the governor were in 
    agreement that it was best that the Natives be given land at Tobique where 
    they could take up agriculture and be protected from alcohol.&nbsp; This would 
    then be the focus of the missionary's service to them, although he would still 
    have some traveling for special purposes and to serve the settlements of French 
    Catholics.&nbsp; This cooperatoin with the British officials extended even 
    to financial support, for the colonial authorities paid a stipend to the missionary 
    serving the Natievs in the St.John River Valley.&nbsp; For Ciquard, this stipend 
    was &pound;50... <span class="s08">[<a href="../aroostook/sources.htm#jennings">Jennings</a>, 
    p.127]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<P>Thus the first missionaries in the valley were serving the Maliseet population. 
  &nbsp; But the Acadians, who were Roman Catholics, also relied on the services 
  of these missionaries. And as Plessis noted above, as the native population 
  dwindled, the Acadian and Canadian population grew, thus providing more demand 
  for the missionaries' services.&nbsp; These were missionaries not in the sense 
  that they were sent to convert people; rather, they were sent to watch over 
  and tend to the religious needs of the Catholic population in an area that did 
  not have its own established parish infrastructure.</P>
<P>Below is a list of the early missionary priests who were responsible for the 
  Madawaska settlements, the dates of their tenure, and their home parishes. As 
  you can see, they all came from either L'Isle Verte or Kamouraska, both of which 
  were the major sources of settlers from Qu&eacute;bec in the Valley. With the 
  establishment of St. Basile parish (St-Basile-le-Grand) in about 1804, and especially 
  after 1807, the priests were resident at (assigned permanently to) St. Basile.</P>
<P>At first the parish of St. Basile included the entire upper St. John Valley. 
  In 1838 St. Bruno was formed into a separate parish; the church of St. Bruno 
  had already existed for a number of years before that (before 1831), but with 
  priests residing at St. Basile. Likewise, Ste-Luce in Frenchville had had a 
  church or chapel for many years before it was set aside as its own parish, with 
  the coming of <a href="../dionne/d9155.htm">Father Henri Dionne</a> in August 
  1843. The dividing line between St. Basile and Ste. Luce parishes was however 
  set much before this; by 1831, in their <a href="../aroostook/deane-kavanagh.htm">report 
  on the Madawaska settlements</a>, Deane and Kavanagh note that the dividing 
  line between these two parishes was &quot;Harford Brook&quot; (now, probably, 
  Three Mile Brook, in N.B.)</P>
