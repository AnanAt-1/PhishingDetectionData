FOREWORD 


At  6  a.m.,  on  February  9,  1971,  the  Los  Angeles,  Cali- 
fornia, area  was  struck  by  a  disastrous  earthquake  of 
Richter  magnitude  6.5.  First  reports  did  not  indicate  how 
severe  was  the  'quake  nor  how  extensive  the  damage;  but, 
within  minutes,  police  and  other  emergency  agencies  acted. 
In  less  than  two  hours,  the  American  National  Red  Cross 
had  shelters  operating,  and,  within  the  same  span  of  time, 
scientists  were  at  work  studying  the  effects  of  the  earth- 
quake. 

Soon  It  became  apparent  that  the  communities  of  San 
Fernando,  Saugus,  and  Sylmar,  in  the  northwestern  San 
Fernando  Valley,  sustained  the  greatest  damage.  Nearly 
all  deaths  attributed  to  the  earthquake — a  total  of  64 — 
were  in  these  communities. 

Seismological  records  showed  that  the  main  shock  oc- 
curred at  14  h  00m  41.65  (GMT).  Its  epicenter  was  near 
latitude  34°24'  N  and  longitude  118°24'  W,  in  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains.  The  focal  depth  was  calculated  to  be 
8.4  ±  4  km.  There  were  35  aftershocks  with  a  Richter 
magnitude  of  4.0  or  more  recorded  within  the  first  seven 
minutes  following  the  main  shock;  aftershocks  of  similar 
magnitude  continued  through  the  year. 

The  San  Fernando  earthquake — as  it  has  been  called — 
occurred  near  the  center  of  the  largest  concentration  of 
strong-motion  recording  instruments  in  the  United  States. 
At  that  time,  there  were  about  340  instruments  in  the 
area,  which  provided  the  largest  number  of  strong-motion 
records  ever  written  by  any  earthquake.  One  of  them,  an 
accelerograph  located  at  Pacoima  Dam,  virtually  at  the 
epicenter,  measured  the  strongest  ground  motion  ever 
recorded. 

In  the  long,  geologic  view,  this  earthquake  was  but  one 
of  a  myriad  of  'quakes  that  must  have  taken  place  during 
the  uplifting  of  the  Transverse  Ranges,  of  which  the  San 
Gabriels  are  a  part.  It  was  one  of  many  movements  that, 
totalled  together,  pushed  the  mountains  upward  a  matter 
of  miles. 

Yet  it  is  the  smaller  parts  of  this  small  geologic  event  that 
tell  the  story.  Geologists  spent  many  months  measuring  sur- 
face effects  in  detail  to  prepare  the  most  complete  docu- 
ment ever  made  of  these  earthquake  features — a  document 
that  will  be  studied  for  years  to  come. 

Shattered  ridge  tops — "plowed  ground" — noted  in  earth- 
quakes before  but  not  in  such  profusion,  indicated  a  con- 
centration of  shaking  energy  along  narrow  hills  capped 
by  thin  sedimentary  beds.  Many  such  areas  were  mapped 
by  geologists  of  the  California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geol- 
ogy in  the  year  following  the  earthquake;  one  paper  in 


this  volume  suggests  a  means  by  which  the  required  energy 
might  have  been  concentrated  on  the  ridge  tops. 

Painstaking  care  allowed  the  mapping  of  the  many  fault 
traces  and  surface  breaks  (see  plate  3)  which  formed  on 
intricate  pattern.  Geologists  combined  field  work  and 
photogeology  to  map  thousands  of  landslides  triggered  or 
reactivated  by  the  shocks.  The  landslides  were,  fortunately, 
in  the  hills  where  there  were  few  buildings  to  damage. 

The  destruction  of  buildings  and  tragic  loss  of  life 
dramatically  revealed  the  unsafe  construction  of  some 
buildings.  Total  monetary  loss  from  the  earthquake 
amounted  to  an  estimated  $511  million,  or  $71  per  person 
in  the  Los  Angeles  area. 

In  spite  of  this  high  loss,  most  buildings  behaved  very 
well.  No  public  school  building  collapsed,  although  sev- 
eral that  were  built  before  the  "Field  act" — the  law  re- 
quiring that  school  buildings  be  built  to  earthquake-re- 
sistant construction  standards — had  to  be  razed.  Very 
few  structural  defects  developed  in  schools  meeting  these 
standards,  and  no  school  was  seriously  damaged.  Had  stu- 
dents been  in  any  of  these  earthquake-resistant  schools  at 
the  time  of  the  earthquake,  they  would  have  been  safe. 

Most  of  the  buildings  designed  and  constructed  to  similar 
standards  held  up  well.  On  the  whole,  connections  between 
different  parts  of  structures  were  the  weakest. 

The  San  Fernando  earthquake  has  given  us  an  op- 
portunity to  reassess  our  position  in  regard  to  earthquakes. 
Engineers  have  had  an  opportunity  to  reassess  building 
codes,  seeking  out  weaknesses  and  re-examining  the  provi- 
sions that  proved  good;  geologists  and  seismologists  have 
been  able  to  reassess  their  perception  of  crustal  response 
to  earthquakes,  and  to  reconsider  how  they,  as  scientists, 
should  organize  their  study  of  any  earthquake;  agencies 
of  various  levels  of  government  have  reassessed  their  posi- 
tion in  regard  to  earthquake  safety. 

Such  study  and  reassessment  does  pay  off,  as  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake  has  shown.  The  deaths,  unfortunate 
though  they  were,  nearly  all  took  place  in  buildings  that 
were  not  built  to  earthquake-resistant  codes.  The  casualty 
factor  in  personal  residences  in  the  shaken  area  was  less 
than  one  person  per  million.  Since  most  people  were  at 
home,  this  is  a  phenomenally  low  casualty  rote,  and  clearly 
reflects  the  wisdom  of  good  building  codes  and  thorough 
enforcement.  Had  such  a  strong  earthquake  struck  in  as 
highly  a  populated  area  where  good  construction  based 
on  the  best  available  knowledge  did  not  prevail,  the 
tragedy  would  have  been  nearly  incalculable.

CHAPTER   1 

Tectonic  Seffing  of  fhe  San  Gabriel  Mountains 

by  D.  M.  Morton  ^  and  A.  K.  Baird  ^ 


The  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  a  part  of  the  Transverse 
Range  Province  and  perhaps  part  of  a  much  larger 
transverse  structural  province,  have  undergone  re- 
peated deformation  giving  rise  to  east-trending  struc- 
tures. Structures  within  pre-Mesozoic  batholithic  rocks, 
and  structures  and  chemistry  of  batholithic  rocks,  indi- 
cate these  east-trending  structures  had  their  inception 
by  Late  Cretaceous  time,  and,  perhaps,  much  earlier. 
Deformation  resulted  in  the  formation  of  depositional 
basins,  folds,  and  faults. 

A  frontal  fault  system,  the  Malibu  Coast-Cuca- 
monga,  marks  the  southern  margin  of  the  western 
Transverse  Ranges  and  separates  basement  with  abun- 
dant Precambrian  rocks  in  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains from  basement  rocks  in  the  Peninsular  Ranges 
which  do  not  contain  rocks  of  known,  or  even  sus- 
pected, Precambrian  age.  The  San  Gabriel  Mountains 
have  been  uplifted  along  the  frontal  fault  system, 
which  has  had  a  dip-slip  component  totaling  at  least 
IO,SOO  feet  in  several  localities. 

Considerable  evidence  indicates  the  fault  system 
along  the  entire  south  front  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains has  undergone  repeated  Quaternary  displace- 
ments. These  displacements  have  consisted  largely,  if 
not  entirely,  of  reverse  dip-slip  movement.  At  the 
present  time,  these  movements  may  be  relieving  elastic 
strain  accumulating  on  the  San  Andreas  fault  zone. 

GENERAL 

The  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  a  lenticular  range  about 
60  miles  long,  are  bounded  by  major  fault  zones  on 
the  north  (San  Andreas),  south  (Cucamonga),  and 
southwest  (Sierra  Madre).  Soledad  Canyon  forms  the 
northwestern  topographic  boundary.  Plutonic  and 
metamorphic  basement  rocks,  which  comprise  most  of 
the  mountains,  range  in  age  from  over  1700  m.v. 
(Silver,  1966,  1971)  to  20  m.y.  (Hsu,  et  al,  1963). 

The  other  ranges  of  prominence  are  the  San  Bernar- 
dino, Santa  Monica,  and  Santa  Ynez.  These  are  physio- 
graphically  and  structurally  anomalous  east-trending 
mountains  which  are  set  athwart  the  othetAvise  con- 
sistent northwest  grain  of  the  state.  Evidence  indicates 
this  east-trend  pre-dates  considerably  the  geomorpho- 
logically  youthful  mountain  ranges.  Their  present 
physiography  merely  reflects  the  much  older  structure. 
The  Province  extends  from  off^shore,  where  sea  floor 
highlands  form  the  channel  islands  on  the  continental 
borderland,  eastward  some  300  miles  to  the  vicinity  of 
the  Little  San  Bernardino  Mountains,  where  physio- 
graphic expression  of  the  province  becomes  vague 
(plate  1 ).  The  southern  margin  of  the  Province  is  well

delineated  by  a  frontal  fault  system:  the  combined 
Malibu  Coast-Cucamonga  fault  complex.  This  com- 
plex, from  west  to  east,  consists  of  the  Malibu  Coast, 
Santa  Monica,  Raymond  Hill,  Sierra  Madre,  and  Cuca- 
monga faults.  The  Banning  fault  is  assumed  to  be  an 
eastward  continuation  of  the  frontal  fault  system,  off- 
set to  the  southeast  by  the  San  Jacinto  fault.  The 
northern  margin  of  the  Province  is  less  clearly  defined 
except  for  the  steep  north  slope  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains,  which  provides  a  sharp  physiographic 
boundary  (at  the  San  Andreas  fault)  against  the  Mo- 
jave  Desert  Province. 

On  a  large  scale,  the  Transverse  Ranges  Province 
has  long  been  considered  part  of  a  major  structural 
feature  that  extends  eastward  into  Texas.  This  was 
recognized  prior  to  1902  by  R.  T.  Hill  (1902,  p.  172- 
173)  as  a  "transverse  line."  Later  Ransome  (1915,  p. 
29+-295)  drew  attention  specifically  to  Hill's  "trans- 
verse line"  to  which  he  gave  the  name  "Texas  Line- 
ament." Ransome  noted  the  eastward  and  westward 
parts  are  relatively  well  defined  (he  considered  Point 
Conception  as  the  western  terminus);  but,  over  the 
total  length,  it  is  relatively  vaguely  defined  "and  per- 
haps in  part  imaginary  .  .  ."  (p.  295).  This  transverse 
structure  (Texas  Lineament)  has  received  repeated 
attention  and  comment  (for  example,  R.  T.  Hill,  1928; 
Baker,  1933,  1934;  Albritton  and  Smith,  1957;  and 
Muehlberger,  1965). 

In  addition  to  the  Texas  Lineament,  speculation  has 
revolved  about  the  coincidence  of  the  southern  margin 
of  the  province  with  the  Murray  fracture  zone.  Some 
have  questioned  whether  the  alignment  is  fortuitous 
(for  example,  Gilluly,  1970,  p.  64,  66-67,  68-69; 
Menard,  1955,  p.  1197).  However,  Vacquier,  et  al. 
(1961,  p.  1253),  state  all  magnetic  and  bathymetric 
expression  of  the  Murray  fracture  zone  stops  east  of 
124°  W.  longitude  with  a  4°  longitudinal  gap  between 
the  eastern  end  of  the  zone  and  the  Channel  Islands. 
This  has  been  supported  by  von  Huene  (1969,  1971) 
who,  from  continental  shelf  data,  found  Transverse 
Range  structures  developed  since  late  Miocene  or 
early  Pliocene  time.  He  considered,  however,  that  there 
may  have  been  a  more  extensive  pre-Miocene  Murray 
fracture  system  extending  on  shore. 

Though  the  question  of  a  definite  or  genetic  rela- 
tionship to  larger  structural  features  (that  is,  the  Texas 
Lineament  and  Murray  Fracture  Zone)  is  unresolved, 
the  Transverse  Ranges  Province,  as  an  entity,  remains 
a  structural  feature  of  first-order  importance  within 
California. 

A  notable  feature  of  the  Province  is  the  abundance 
of  rocks  of  Precambrian  age.  South  of  the  Malibu 
Coast-Cucamonga    fault    system     (in    the    Peninsular 


California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology 


Bull.  196 


R;ingcs  Province),  there  nrc  no  known,  or  even  sus- 
pected, Prccnmbrian  ngc  rocks  (Baird,  et  al.,  1971). 
Furthermore,  published  dates  for  Mesozoic  granitic 
rocks  in  the  Snn  Cahricl  .Mountains,  bv  both  K-.\r 
method  (Evcrnden  and  Kistjcr,  1970)  and  Pb  method 
(Silver,  1971),  gi\c  ages  of  10  to  45  m.\-.  less  th;in  the 
Mesozoic  granitic  rocks  in  the  Peninsular  Ranges  Prov- 
ince. These  facts  suggest  that  a  fundamental  division 
exists  within  basement  rocks  of  southern  California. 
The  line  marking  these  differences  is  the  frontal  fault 
system  of  the  Transverse  Ranges  to  the  west;  to  the 
east,  where  the  boundary  curves  southward,  it  coin- 
cides with  the  Salton  Trough. 

AGE  OF  THE  TRANSVERSE  STRUCTURES 
Throughout  the  Transverse  Ranges  Province,  east- 
trending  stnictures  predominate.  In  metamorphic  rocks 
this  common  orientation  stands  out  in  contrast  to  the 
quite  uniform  northwest  structural  orientation  in  the 
Peninsular  Ranges  Province  (Baird,  et  al.,  1971).  Some 
cast-trending  structures  have  obviously  been  in  part 
produced  or  intensified  during  Tertiary  deformations 
(for  example,  the  eastern  Santa  iMonica  Alountains  area 
as  shown  by  Hoots,  1930);  however,  most  east-west 
structures  had  their  origins  prior  to  the  emplacement 
of  .Mesozoic  plutonic  rocks  as  demonstrated  by  trun- 
cated foliation  and/or  layering  against  the  plutonic 
rock  bodies. 

.Many  of  the  granitic  plutons  have  an  east-trending 
elongation  and  an  internal  foliation  and/or  layering 
with  a  similar  east-trend,  which  is  again  in  marked 
contrast  to  the  northwest  trend  in  the  plutonic  rocks 
and  structures  of  the  Peninsular  Ranges  Province. 
Moreover,  the  areal  distribution  of  major  elemental 
chemistr\-  and  specific  gravity  of  the  rocks  directly 
coincides  with  the  batholithic  structures  in  the  rvvo 
provinces.  Such  trends  exist  throughout  the  San 
Gabriel  and  San  Bernardino  .Mountains,  whereas  north- 
west trends  occur  throughout  the  Peninsular  Ranges 
(Baird,  et  al.,  1970). 

For  post-batholithic  rocks,  east-trends  predominate 
throughout  the  Transverse  Ranges  and  again  stand  in 
contrast  to  the  northwest  trends  in  the  Peninsular 
Ranges  to  the  south  and  the  Coast  Ranges  to  the  north 
(Baird,  ct  al.,  1971).  Crowell  (1971,  p.  106)  stated  that 
sedimentary  patterns  for  the  Cretaceous,  Paleocene,  and 
Foccne  suggest  an  east-trending  fracture  system  for 
those  times.  Winterer  and  Durham  (1962)  believed 
the  southeastern  \'entura  basin  was  prohabl\-  a  deposi- 
tional  site  during  the  Paleocene;  Oakeshott  (1958,  p. 
62)  deduced  that  the  eastern  Ventura  basin,  including 
the  Soledad  basin,  was  in  existence  b\'  late  Eocene 
time;  and  Edwards  (1971)  presented  evidence  for 
deposition  in  the  \'entura-Soledad  basin  by  late  Eo- 
cene time,  accompanied  by  deformation  and  a  north- 
south  oscillation  of  the  shoreline.  However,  Yerkes 
and  Campbell  (1971)  indicated  pre-middle  Miocene 
shorelines  retained  their  north-northwest  trend  through 
the  Transverse  Ranges. 

Clearly,  since  middle  Miocene  time,  there  has  been 
deformation  resulting  in  east-trending  .structures.  In  the 
western  Santa  Monica  Mountains,  Campbell,  et  al., 
(1966,  p.  5)  showed  that  rocks  of  Late  Cretaceous  age 


were  at  least  gentl&gt;-  folded,  apparently  about  a  west-to- 
northwest  axis  prior  to  emplacement  of  a  series  of 
three  detachment  sheets  during  latest  middle  Miocene 
time.  The  detachment  sheets  were  themselves  later 
folded  about  an  cast-trending  axis.  Hoots  (1930,  espe- 
cially cross-section  E-E')  diagrammatically  indicated 
repeated  folding  of  the  rocks  in  the  eastern  Santa 
Monica  Mountains.  His  cross-sections  show  the  Juras- 
sic Santa  Monica  Slate  to  have  been  deformed  about  an 
easterly  trending  axis  prior  to  the  deposition  of  Upper 
Cretaceous  rocks  ("Chico"),  with  subsequent  similar 
folding  affecting,  in  sequence,  "Chico"  rocks,  middle 
Miocene  Topanga  rocks,  and  finali\-  the  Modelo 
Formation  of  late  Aliocene  age.  From  Pliocene  time 
on,  repeated  east-trending  deformation  was  common 
throughout  the  Transverse  Ranges. 

MAJOR  FAULTS  OF  THE  SAN  GABRIEL  MOUNTAINS 

Inactive  Faults 

Vincent  thrust.  Perhaps  the  oldest  recognizable 
fault  in  the  Transverse  Ranges  is  the  west-  to  north- 
west-striking X^incent  thrust  together  with  assumed 
related  faults  of  the  San  Gabriel  and  San  Bernardino 
iMountains  area.  Ehlig  (1968)  considered  the  cataclastic 
deformation  associated  with  the  \^incent  thrust  to  have 
occurred  probably  in  Late  Cretaceous  after  the 
emplacement  of  Mesozoic  batholithic  rocks.  He  be- 
lieved the  upper  plate  moved  northeastward.  Burchfiel 
and  Davis  (1970)  considered  the  Vincent  thrust  to  be 
part  of  a  large  two-sided  thrust  complex  (zivischenge- 
hirge)  centered  on  the  Alojave  Desert,  northeast  of  the 
San  Gabriel  .Mountains.  They  inferred  the  upper  plate 
to  have  moved  wcsrw^ard  with  a  minimum  displacement 
greater  than  75  miles. 

Large-magnitude  east-trending  and  north-dipping 
shear  zones  are  present  in  the  frontal  part  of  the  south- 
eastern San  Gabriel  .Mountains  (Alf,  1948;  Hsu,  1955). 
Here  both  granitic  and  high-grade  metamorphic  rocks 
have  been  cataclastically  deformed,  probably  during 
the  last  part  of  Cretaceous  time.  Orientations  of  minor 
structures  within  these  rocks  indicate  a  major  com- 
ponent of  dip-slip  movement  (D.  M.  .Morton,  unpub- 
lished mapping).  Both  the  temporal  and  genetic 
relations  of  these  cataclastic  rocks  to  those  of  the  Vin- 
cent thrust  are  unknown. 

Scm  Gabriel  fault.  The  San  Gabriel  fault,  now  con- 
sidered by  many  to  be  inactive,  is  an  important 
younger  fault  with  Tertiary  movement.  Crowell  be- 
lieved it  to  have  had  a  right  lateral  displacement  of 
about  20  miles  and  a  dip-slip  movement  of  as  much 
as  14,000  feet  (1952,  1954).  .Movement  on  this  fault 
occurred  from  early  late  .Miocene  time  to  about  the 
end  of  the  Pliocene  epoch  and  was  locally  reactivated 
during  the  Pleistocene  (Crowell,  1952,  1954).  Ehlig 
(1966,  p.  60)  found  basement  rock  contacts  oft- 
set  13  miles  in  the  central  San  Gabriel  .Mountains 
along  this  fault.  However,  Paschall  and  Off  (1961), 
in  the  eastern  \'entura  basin,  have  deduced  an  alter- 
native sense  of  movement  for  the  San  Gabriel  fault. 
They  found  e\idcncc  for  at  least  four  alternations 
of  uplift  and  subsidence,  each  of  which  included  thou- 
sands of  vertical  feet  of  movement  during  the  Tertiary, 


1974 


San  Fernando  Earthquake — Geology  and  Geophysics 


and  suggested  that  the  total  fault  movement  was  pre- 
dominantly, if  not  entirely,  vertical. 

Faults  of  the  San  Andreas  System 

There  are  other  faults  in  the  San  Andreas  system  in 
addition  to  the  San  Andreas  fault  itself  in  the  eastern 
San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Oldest  of  these  is  the  appar- 
ently inactive  Punchbowl  fault,  which  merges  with 
the  San  Andreas  in  the  Devore  area  and  has  a  some- 
what sinuous  trace  northwestward  to  the  Devils 
Punchbowl  area  (Dibblee,  1968).  For  most  of  its 
length,  it  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  sheared 
gneiss  within  the  fault  zone.  West  of  the  Punchbowl 
ifault  is  the  active  Glen  Helen  fault,  exposed  in  the 
west  side  of  lower  Cajon  Creek.  It  extends  southeast- 
ward into  the  San  Bernardino  Valley,  and  to  the  north- 
west it  turns  abruptly  westward  entering  Lytle  Creek 
where  it  may  join  the  San  Jacinto  fault.  The  San 
Jacinto  fault,  west  of  the  Glen  Helen  fault,  enters  the 
San  Gabriel  Mountains  near  the  mouth  of  Lytle  Creek. 
Branches  of  the  San  Jacinto  strike  westward  to  west- 
southwest  paralleling  the  length  of  the  mountain  range. 
Dibblee  (1968)  suggested  that  the  San  Jacinto  fault 
dies  out  in  the  upper  reaches  of  the  creek.  Several 
other  apparent  right-lateral  faults  are  west  of  the  San 
Jacinto  fault. 

Left-Lateral  Faults 

Northeast-striking  left-lateral  faults  occur  in  the 
eastern  San  Gabriel  Mountains  in  the  vicinity  of  San 
Antonio  Canyon.  Two  of  these  offset  the  Vincent 
thrust  about  4  miles  (Dibblee,  1968;  Rogers,  1965) 
and  a  third  offsets  the  Punchbowl  fault  (D.  M.  Mor- 
ton, unpublished  mapping).  Farther  west  in  the  Pa- 
cifico  Mountain  area  are  several  left-lateral  northeast- 
striking  faults,  including  the  Transmission  Line,  Pole 
Canyon,  and  Magic  Mountain  faults  (Oakeshott,  1958; 
Jennings  and  Strand,  1969),  with  lateral  displacement 
of  the  order  of  1  to  2  miles. 

Transverse  Faults 

The  most  impressive  east-trending  structure  of  the 
Transverse  Ranges  Province  is  the  frontal  fault  system 
which  is  the  boundary  between  the  greatly  contrasting 
basement  rocks  of  the  Transverse  Ranges — especially 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountains — with  the  Peninsular 
Range  Province  to  the  south.  It  extends,  east  to  west, 
from  the  San  Jacinto  fault  to  offshore  in  the  Malibu 
area.  East  of  the  San  Jacinto  fault,  the  frontal  fault 
system  appears  to  be  offset  by  the  San  Jacinto  fault 
about  15  miles  right  laterally,  where,  in  the  San  Gor- 
gonio  Pass  area,  it  is  termed  the  Banning  fault  (Allen, 
1957;  Sharp,  1967).  Immediately  west  of  the  San 
Jacinto  fault  the  prevailing  name  for  the  frontal  fault 
is  the  Cucamonga;  further  west,  in  the  Azusa-Sierra 
Madre  area,  it  is  the  Sierra  Madre;  through  Pasadena, 
the  Raymond  Hill;  in  the  vicinity  of  Beverly  Hills, 
the  Santa  Monica;  and  in  the  Malibu  area,  the  Malibu 
Coast  fault.  Between  Monrovia  and  Sierra  Madre  the 
system  branches  to  the  west  (or  the  two  merge  to  the 
east)  with  the  main  (principal)  continuation  being 
west\vard  along  the  Raymond  Hill  fault.  The  second 
fault  zone  extends  to  the  northwest  and,  in  turn, 
branches  into  two  fault  zones.  The  northernmost  zone, 


which  enters  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  is  apparently 
a  branch  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault  (Oakeshott,  1954), 
although  some  have  considered  it  to  be  the  continua- 
tion of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  (for  example,  Bailey 
and  Jahns,  1954).  The  southern  fault  zone  lies  be- 
tween the  Verdugo  Mountains,  to  the  south,  and  the 
San  Gabriel  Mountains  and  projects  westward  into 
northern  San  Fernando  Valley  area  (Bailey  and  Jahns, 
1954;  Oakeshott,  1954,  1958),  and  has  been  considered 
to  be  the  Sierra  Madre  zone  (Oakeshott,  1958). 

From  the  Sylmar  area,  where  the  maior  breaks 
have  been  termed  the  Lopez  fault  (M.  L.  Hill,  1930) 
and  Hospital  fault  (Oakeshott,  1958),  the  zone  con- 
tinues westward  as  the  Santa  Susana  fault  (thrust)  into 
the  Santa  Susana  Mountains.  South  of  the  Santa  Su- 
sana A4ountains  several  east-trending  faults  such  as 
Mission  Hills,  Granada  Hills,  and  Northridge  Hills 
(Wenrworth  and  Yerkes,  1971,  p.  8)  are  part  of  the 
frontal  fault  system.  For  the  structural  details  of  the 
northern  San  Fernando  Valley  area,  see  Oakeshott, 
this  Bulletin. 

Throughout  its  extent  the  frontal  fault  system  is 
characterized  by  moderate  to  shallow  northward  dips 
into  the  mountains.  Only  in  the  area  immediately  west 
of  Little  Santa  Anita  Canyon  do  vertical  dips  prevail 
(Morton,  1971)  but  these  shortly  pass  into  northward- 
dipping  faults  to  the  west  (Saul,  1971). 

Magnimde  of  displaceiiievt.  As  evidenced  by  the 
abruptly  rising  mountain  front  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains,  there  must  have  been  considerable  recent 
reverse  dip-slip  movement  on  the  frontal  fault  system. 
Dip-slip  separation  on  the  Cucamonga  fault  segment 
can  only  be  estimated.  Eckis  (1928,  p.  226)  consid- 
ered a  vertical  displacement  of  4,000  to  5,000  feet; 
this  is  probably  a  very  conservative  figure. 

In  the  Azusa-Duarte  area,  two  exploratory  wells 
drilled  about  a  mile  and  a  half  south  of  exposed  gra- 
nitic rocks  bottomed  at  depths  of  6,914  feet  and  7,854 
feet  in  middle  Miocene  Glendora  Volcanics  and 
Topanga  Formation  respectively  (California  Division 
of  Oil  and  Gas,  1962,  1969).  These  rock  types  crop 
out  adjacent  to  the  well  sites  where  they  form  a  large 
overturned  synclinal  structure  produced  by  move- 
ment on  the  frontal  fault  (Morton,  1971;  Shelton, 
1955).  Basement  rocks  rise  abruptly  3,000  feet  above 
the  valley  floor,  suggesting  the  total  vertical  displace- 
ment here  is  on  the  order  of  10,000  feet. 

At  the  mouth  of  Big  Santa  Anita  Canyon,  thrusting 
of  gneiss  over  older  alluvium  (Morton,  1971)  suggests 
vertical  displacements  on  the  order  of  4,000  feet  on  a 
northern  branch  of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone,  or  a 
southern  branch  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault.  Offset  base- 
ment on  the  Raymond  Hill  fault,  to  the  south,  is  prob- 
ably of  the  same  order  of  magnitude. 

More  spectacular  yet  is  the  displacement  indicated 
by  the  available  information  from  Sunra&gt;-  Oil  Com- 
pany's Stetson-Sombrero  well  #1.  This  well  was  drilled 
1  mile  north  of  Sylmar  and  about  half  a  mile  south 
of  granitic  rock  basement  (Oakeshott,  1958).  It  had 
a  total  depth  of  12,027  feet  and  apparently  was  wholly 
within  nonmarine  Saugus  Formation  of  Quaternary 
age  (Oakeshott,  1958).  However,  rumors  say  that  the 


California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology 


Bull.  196 


well  bottomed  in  rocks  bearing  upper  Pliocene  brack- 
ish water  fauna.  This  would  suggest  the  total  sedi- 
mentary section  adjacent  to  the  mountain  front  may 
be  of  the  order  of  20,000  feet.  A  similar  geologic 
setting  is  indicated  by  Richfield  Oil  Corporation's 
T.I.  &amp;  T.l  well,  drilled  about  2  miles  west  of  the 
Stetson-Sombrero  #1.  This  well,  located  just  south  of 
the  Santa  Susana  fault,  was  entirely  within  continental 
sediments,  presumably  Saugus  Formation,  for  its  entire 
depth  of  8.207  feet. 

Ycrkes  and  Campbell  (1971)  considered  the  left-lat- 
eral component  of  movement  for  the  frontal  fault 
s&gt;'stem  to  be  more  than  50  miles  and  to  have  been 
initiated  in  mid-Miocene  time  in  response  to  sea-floor 
spreading  (Campbell  and  Yerkes,  1971). 

Recency  of  fault  movement.  Throughout  the  ex- 
tent of  the  frontal  fault  zone,  there  is  abundant  evi- 
dence for  displacement  during  or  after  Pleistocene 
time.  Wentworth,  et  al.  (1970),  indicate  that,  for  most 
of  the  frontal  fault  system  west  of  Glendora,  there  is 
evidence  for  fault  displacement  between  11,000  and 
.^00,000-500,000  years  ago. 

In  the  L\tle  Creek  area,  basement  has  been  thrust 
over  steeply  dipping  continental  beds  of  probable 
Pliocene  or  early  Pleistocene  age.  West  of  Lytle 
Creek,  the  alluvial  fan  at  the  mouth  of  Day  Canyon 
is  cut  b\-  several  scarps,  the  youngest  of  which  is 
10-15  feet  high  and  3  miles  long.  An  older  modified 
scarp  is  120  feet  high,  and  a  yet  older  scarp  in  the 
alluvial  fan  is  200  to  280  feet' high  (Eckis,  1928,  p. 
230).  Two  drainages  west,  at  the  mouth  of  Cuca- 
monga  Canyon,  there  are  two  scarps  in  alluvial  fan 
deposits,  a  younger  10-foot  and  an  older  60-75  foot 
scarp  (Eckis,  1928,  p.  229-230).  Several  miles  south 


of  the  mountain  front  are  several  modified  scarps  (for 
example.  Red  Hill  and  Indian  Hill)  in  late  Pleistocene 
alluvium. 

In  the  Azusa-Duarte  area,  faulting  was  contempora- 
neous with  and  followed  the  deposition  of  the  late 
Pleistocene  San  Dimas  Formation  (Morton,  1971). 
Such  physiographic  breaks  as  Bradbur\'  Mesa  may  be 
the  expression  of  considerably  younger  modified 
scarps. 

North  of  Arcadia,  gneiss  (Precambrian?)  has  been 
thrust  over  Quaternary  (late  Pleistocene?)  alluvium 
at  the  mouth  of  Santa  Anita  Canyon  (Morton,  1971), 
and  to  the  south  the  Raymond  Hill  fault  forms  a  scarp 
in  alluvium  50  to  150  feet  high  (Fckis,  1934,  p.  69). 
Proctor  et  al.  (1970,  p.  8)  report  11  occurrences  of 
basement  rocks  thrust  over  Quaternary  deposits  along 
a  2 2 -mile  long  segment  of  the  frontal  fault  system 
west  of  Glendora. 

Relation  of  movement  oji  the  frontal  fault  system 
to  the  San  Andreas  system.  Some  consider  recent 
movement  on  the  frontal  fault  system  is  in  response 
to  accumulating  elastic  strain  on  the  San  .\ndreas  fault 
system  (for  example,  Don  L.  Anderson,  as  quoted  in 
California  Geology,  1971,  v.  24,  p.  73).  The  faulting 
on  the  frontal  faults  is  believed  to  be  produced  by 
north-south  compression,  which  is  a  component  of 
strain  normally  producing  right  lateral  strike-slip 
movement  on  the  more  westward-striking  part  of  the 
San  Andreas  fault  as  it  enters  the  Transverse  Ranges 
Province  from  the  north.  If  this  is  the  case,  the  present 
day  strain  release  is  probably  taking  advantage  of  the 
older  east-trending  break  in  the  Transverse  Ranges 
structure. 


CHAPTER  2 

Geologic  Framework  of  the  Son  Gabriel  Mountains ' 

by  Perry  L.  Ehlig  ^ 


Although  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  was  un- 
predictable in  its  location  and  timing,  the  faulting  and 
associated  uplifting  of  the  mountains  were  not  unex- 
pected. The  San  Gabriel  Mountains  have  long  been 
recognized  as  a  young,  tectonically  active  range.  They 
form  an  impressively  rugged  barrier,  60  miles  long 
and  about  20  miles  wide,  separating  the  Mojave  Desert 
on  the  north  from  the  low-lying  San  Fernando,  San 
Gabriel,  and  Pomona  valleys  on  the  south.  The  south- 
ern margin  of  the  range  juts  up  abruptly  from  the 
adjoining  alluvial  valleys.  It  is  controlled  by  a  complex 
series  of  interconnecting,  northward-dipping  reverse 
faults  including  the  fault  which  caused  the  San  Fer- 
nando earthquake.  The  northern  margin  of  the  range 
nearly  coincides  with  the  trace  of  the  San  Andreas 
fault  but  is  controlled  by  arching  and  differential  ero- 
sion, as  well  as  faulting.  The  interior  of  the  range  is 
deeply  dissected  by  streams.  The  most  prominent 
peaks  rise  8000  to  10,000  feet  above  sea  level  in  the 
eastern  and  north-central  parts  of  the  range  and  5000 
to  7000  feet  above  sea  level  in  the  south-central  and 
western  parts.  The  highest  peak  is  10,062-foot  Mount 
San  Antonio. 

SUMMARY 

The  San  Gabriel  Mountains  are  a  major  east-west- 
trending  range  within  the  Transverse  Range  province 
of  southern  California  which  contain  900  square  miles 
of  exposed  igneous  and  metamorphic  rocks  (see  plate 
1  in  pocket). 

Precambrian  gneiss  and  amphibolite  form  the  host 
for  several  ages  of  intrusive  rocks  within  the  central 
and  western  parts  of  the  range.  Precambrian  anorthos- 
ite  and  related  rocks  crop  out  in  a  highly  deformed 
layered  intrusion  of  80  square  miles  in  the  western  part 
of  the  range.  Permian-Triassic  Lowe  Granodiorite 
forms  a  northwest-trending,  compositionally  zoned 
pluton  of  100  square  miles  within  the  central  and 
northwestern  parts  of  the  range.  Mesozoic  granitic 
rocks  and  associated  migmatite  are  abundant  in  the 
center  of  the  range. 

In  the  northeastern  part  of  the  range,  the  terrane 
is  truncated  by  the  southwesrvvard-dipping  Vincent 
thrust  fault.  A  thick  zone  of  mylonitic  rocks  is  de- 
veloped along  the  thrust.  Mesozoic(?)  Pelona  Schist 
underlies  the  thrust.  The  10,000  feet  of  exposed  schist 
is  derived  from  well-bedded  graywacke  and  shale  in- 
terbedded  with  basaltic  tuff  and  chert.  The  schist  un-

derwent  metamorphism  to  the  grcenschist-facies  grade 
synchronous  with  burial  beneath  the  Vincent  thrust. 

The  southwestern,  eastern,  and  extreme  north- 
eastern parts  of  the  range  contain  Paleozoic  (?)  meta- 
sedimentary  rocks  that  were  extensively  converted  to 
gneiss  and  migmatite  during  intrusion  of  Mesozoic 
granitic  rocks.  These  rocks  are  in  fault  contact  with 
rocks  in  the  interior  of  the  range. 

The  internal  structure  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains is  complicated  by  the  intermingling  of  igneous 
and  metamorphic  rocks,  by  multiple  episodes  of  meta- 
morphism, and  by  faulting.  The  orientation  of  foliation 
is  variable  but  commonl\'  strikes  northwestward  at 
about  45  degrees  to  the  long  axis  of  the  range.  The 
Vincent  thrust  underlies  much  of  the  range.  Rocks 
of  the  upper  plate  of  the  thrust  may  be  a  relatively 
thin  veneer  concealing  the  structure  deep  within  the 
range. 

Several  major  high-angle  faults  transect  the  range. 
The  most  prominent  include  the  San  Gabriel,  San 
Jacinto,  and  San  Andreas  faults,  all  of  which  strike 
between  west  and  northwest  and  have  right-lateral 
displacements  of  many  miles. 

The  San  Gabriel  Mountains  owe  their  present 
height  and  configuration  to  uplift  since  the  mid-Pleis- 
tocene. Uplift  has  been  accomplished  by  reverse  fault- 
ing along  the  southern  front  of  the  range  and  arching 
along  the  northern  margin.  The  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake resulted  from  displacement  along  the  most  west- 
erly segment  of  the  frontal  fault  s&gt;'stem. 

The  San  Gabriel  Mountains  are  part  of  a  contin- 
uous uplift  that  extends  eastward  into  the  San  Ber- 
nardino Mountains  and  westward  into  the  Santa  Susana 
Mountains.  The  uplift  is  superimposed  upon  older 
structures  rather  than  being  controlled  by  them.  The 
uplift  is  a  product  of  crustal  shortening  and  may  re- 
sult from  compression  along  the  bend  in  the  San 
Andreas  fault  or  from  clockwise  rotation  of  Baja 
California. 

GEOLOGIC  SETTING 

The  relatively  simple  geomorphic  boundaries  of 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  are  superimposed  upon  a 
geologically  complex  terrane  cut  by  several  major 
faults.  Most  of  the  exposed  rocks  arc  of  metamorphic 
and  intrusive  igneous  origin  and  range  from  Precam- 
brian to  Miocene.  Cenozoic  sedimentar\-  rocks  arc 
locally  present  near  range  margins,  particularly  near 
the  west  end  in  the  area  affected  by  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  and  on  the  north  adjoining  the  San  Jacinto 
and  San  Andreas  faults.

it  and  the  San  Jacinto  fault  to  tiic  northeast.

The  southwest,  east,  and  northeast  parts  of  the 
range  are  underlain  by  crystalline  rocks  which  differ 
from  those  in  the  interior  and  are  separated  from  them 
b\-  strike-slip  faults.  To  the  south  of  the  San  Gabriel 
fault,  the  southwestern  part  of  the  range  and  the 
nearb\'  X^erdugo  Mountains  and  San  Rafael  Hills  are 
underlain  by  crystalline  rocks  consisting  of  remnants 
of  Paleozoic(?)  metasedimentary  rocks  interspersed 
through  gneiss,  migmatite,  and  granitic  rocks.  A  sim- 
ilar terrane  containing  a  better  preserved  metasedi- 
mentary section  occurs  east  of  the  San  Antonio  fault 
in  the  eastern  part  of  the  range;  however,  it  is  bounded 
on  the  south  by  a  belt  of  mx'lonite  and  granulite- 
facies  rocks.  Rlue  Ridge,  situated  between  the  San 
Jacinto  and  San  .'\iulreas  faults,  is  composed  of  Pelona 
Schist.  Pinyon  Ridge,  northwest  of  Rlue  Ridge,  is 
composed  of  gneiss,  migmatite,  and  granitic  rocks. 
The  terrane  north  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  contains 
Paleozoic(?)  marble  immersed  in  gneiss,  migmatite, 
and  granitic  rocks. 

The  eastern  end  of  the  range  contains  stocks  and 
dikes  of  light-colored,  fine-  to  medium-grained  ma.s- 
sive  quart/  monzonite.  Dikes  and  sills  extending  from 
the   main   bodies   change   into   quartz-latite   porphyry 


u  ith  a  conspicuous  decrease  in  grain  size.  The  quartz 
monzonite  is  of  special  interest  because  it  intrudes  the 
Pelona  Schist  and  V^incent  thrust  and  has  generally 
been  assumed  to  be  of  late  Cretaceous  age.  Dating 
b&gt;-  the  K-A  and  Rb-Sr  methods  indicates  it  is  early 
Miocene  in  age  (Hsu  et  al.,  1963). 

Middle  Miocene  dikes  of  andesite,  basalt,  and  dia- 
base are  locally  common  in  the  southern  and  eastern 
parts  of  the  range. 

ROCK  FORMATIONS 
Precambrian  Gneiss 

The  oldest  dated  rocks  in  the  region  are  quartzo- 
feldspathic  gneisses  and  amphibolite  exposed  in  the 
Soledad  Basin  northwest  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains. 
Uranium-lead  isotope  ratios  in  zircon  indicate  some 
of  these  rocks  arc  1.7  billion  years  old  (Silver,  1971). 
Gneiss  that  may  have  been  part  of  the  same  Precam- 
brian terrane  occurs  in  many  places  within  the  range 
but  is  generally  affected  by  younger  metamorphism 
and  igneous  intrusions. 

One  of  the  most  distinctive  units  is  the  Menden- 
hall  Gneiss  described  and  named  by  Oakeshott  (1958, 
p.  21-29).  This  gneiss  is  mainly  exposed  in  the  western 
part  of  the  range  north  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault  and 
south  of  the  anorthosite  complex.  It  was  subjected  to 
high  temperature  granulite-facies  metamorphism  1.4 
billion  years  ago  (Silver,  1963).  During  this  metamor- 
phism, pre-existing  gneiss,  amphibolite,  and  granitic 
rocks  Avere  converted  to  mineral  assemblages  consist- 
ing of  pyroxene,  garnet,  pertiiitic  feldspars,  and  blue 
quartz.  In  man\-  areas  Mesozoic  metamorphism  has 
converted  the  pyroxene  and  garnet  to  hornblende  and 
biotite;  however,  some  of  the  blue  quartz,  antiperthite, 
and  distinctive  relic  textures  have  been  preserved. 
Remnants  of  the  Mendcnhali  Gneiss  also  occur  be- 
tween the  north  and  south  branches  of  the  San  Ga- 
briel fault  north  of  Altadena  and  in  the  north-central 
part  of  the  range. 

Compositionalh-  layered  quartzofeldspathic  gneiss 
and  amphibolite  having  a  complex  history  hut  showing 
no  evidence  of  granulite-facies  metamorphism  are 
widely  distributed  in  the  east-central  and  southeast- 
central  parts  of  the  range.  These  are  probably  Precam- 
brian but  have  not  been  dated. 

Anorthosite-Gabbro-Syenite  Complex 

A  structurally  complex  body  of  anorthosite  and 
related  rocks  is  exposed  over  an  area  of  about  80 
square  miles  in  the  western  San  Gabriel  Mountains. 
The  complex  is  described  in  reports  bv  Miller  (1931, 
1934);  Oakeshott  (1937,  19.';4,  1958);'Higgs  (1954); 
and  Crowell  and  Walker  (1962).  Purplish  gray  and 
l)lue-gra&gt;-  to  white  andesinc  anorthosite  is  the  most 
abundant  rock  type.  Next  in  relative  abundance  is 
gabbro,  in  which  the  pyroxene  has  been  replaced  by 
amphibole,  and  sxcnite,  part  of  which  contains  blue 
([uartz.  iMan\-  of  the  rocks  arc  exceptionalK-  coarse 
grained  and  have  unusual  textures. 

This  complex  was  emplaccd  1.22  billion  \xars  ago 
(Silver,  1963,  1971).  Recent  studies  by  Carter  (1971) 
indicate    the    complex    was    initially    stratiform    with

prominent  compositional  layering  produced  by  gravi- 
tational settling  of  crystals.  The  structure  has  subse- 
quently become  complex  as  a  result  of  several  episodes 
of  deformation. 

Metamorphosed  gabbro,  p\-roxenitc,  and  perido- 
tite,  which  were  once  part  of  the  main  body,  occur  as 
pendants  in  Lowe  Granodiorite  and  Mesozoic  granitic 
rocks  in  the  northern  and  east-central  parts  of  the 
range. 

A  tectonic  inclusion,  more  than  2  miles  long  and 
several  hundred  feet  thick,  of  extensively  mylonitized 
anorthosite  and  anorthositic  gabbro  occurs  along  the 
\'^incent  thrust  fault  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the 
range.  It  was  probably  dragged  along  the  sole  of  the 
thrust  from  an  anorthositic  terrane  that  once  existed 
to  the  north  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  but  has 
subsequently  been  displaced  by  the  San  .Andreas  fault. 
The  probable  offset  source  terrane  (Crowell,  1962) 
is  presently  exposed  on  the  north  side  of  the  San  An- 
dreas fault  in  the  Orocopia  .Mountains,  130  miles  south- 
east of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains. 

Lowe  Granodiorite 

The  Lowe  Granodiorite  crops  out  in  a  northwest- 
trending  pluton  exposed  over  an  area  of  about  100 
square  miles  in  the  central  part  of  the  range.  The 
pluton  is  compositionally  zoned  and  foliated  parallel 
to  its  sharply  defined,  nearly  vertical  western  margin. 
The  margin  consists  of  medium-grained  hornblende 
diorite.  This  grades  inward  into  a  lighter  colored 
coarse-grained  hornblende  quartz  diorite.  At  an  aver- 
age distance  of  about  half  a  mile  east  of  the  margin, 
orthoclase  phenocrysts  are  conspicuous.  Further  to  the 
east,  hornblende  diminishes,  orthoclase  phenocrysts 
become  large — as  much  as  10  cm  long — and  abundant, 
and  garnet  is  scattered  through  the  rock.  In  the  inte- 
rior of  the  pluton,  the  rocks  are  nearly  white  and 
contain  little  besides  feldspar.  Some  are  largely  com- 
posed of  sodic  oligoclase  or  albite.  Throughout  the 
pluton,  the  quartz  content  is  low,  generally  varj^ing  on 


cither  side  of  10  percent.  The  eastern  margin  of  the 
pluton  has  been  fragmented  by  younger  granitic  in- 
trustions  but  appears  to  have  been  less  regular  than 
the  western  margin. 

The  Lowe  Granodiorite  was  named  and  initially 
described  by  Miller  (19.H,  p.  41-46).  Detailed  map- 
ping has  shown  that  part  of  the  rocks  he  described 
and  mapped  are  actually  younger  Mesozoic  granitic 
rocks.  The  Parker  Diorite,  described  by  Miller  (1934, 
p.  37-39)  from  exposures  at  the  west  end  of  the  range, 
is  actually  the  border  facies  of  the  Lowe  Granodiorite. 

Uranium-lead  isotope  ratios  in  zircon  from  Lowe 
Granodiorite  indicate  an  age  of  about  220  ±  10  mil- 
lion years  (Silver,  1971). 

Metamorphosed  Volcanic  Dikes 

Metamorphosed  dikes  are  common  in  the  Lowe 
Granodiorite  and  all  older  rocks  but  are  absent  from 
and  truncated  by  the  IVlesozoic  granitic  rocks.  Dikes 
derived  from  basalt  and  andesite  are  most  common. 
They  presently  consist  of  hornblende  and  plagioclase 
with  metamorphic  textures  and  are  referred  to  as  am- 
phibolite  dikes.  They  are  typically  only  a  few  feet 
thick  and  have  straight,  parallel  \\alls.  Some  contain 
angular  inclusions  of  the  wall  rock. 

Metamorphosed  rhyolite  dikes  containing  scat- 
tered phenocrysts  of  quartz  in  an  aphanitic  ground- 
mass  occur  in  a  belt  several  miles  wide  extending 
northward  through  the  west-central  part  of  the  range. 
The  most  prominent  dikes  were  emplaced  along  gently 
dipping  joints  and  form  sill-like  sheets  as  much  as  50 
feet  thick.  Several  of  these  can  be  traced  for  more 
than  a  mile  without  showing  evidence  of  significant 
post-emplacement  deformation. 

In  general,  dikes  in  the  western  half  of  the  range 
show  little  evidence  of  deformation  since  their  em- 
placement. This  suggests  that  the  pre-.Mesozoic  rocks 
remained  nearh-  rigid  during  the  emplacement  of 
Mesozoic  granitic  rocks.  Many  of  the  amphibolite 
dikes  in  the  east-central  part  of  the  range  are  e.xten-

sively  deformed.  Part  of  the  deformation  post-dates 
the  emplacement  of  cross-cutting  granite  aplitc  and 
pegmatite  dikes  and  ma\-  be  associated  with  the  Vin- 
cent thrust. 

Mesozoic  Granitic  Rocks 

Mesozoic  granitic  rocks,  ranging  from  quartz  di- 
orite  to  quartz  monzonitc  in  composition,  intrude  ail 
other  pre-Cenozoic  rock  units  except  the  Pelona  Schist. 
The  quartz  dioritc  is  general!)-  composed  of  40  to  60 
percent  sodic  andesinc,  15  to  25  percent  quartz,  10 
to  25  percent  hornblende  and  5  to  10  percent  biotite. 
The  quartz  monzonitc  gcneraly  contains  nearly  equal 
amounts  of  quartz,  calcic  oligoclase,  and  orthoclasc 
with  5  to  10  percent  biotite  as  the  only  dark  mineral. 
Granodioritc,  an  intermediate  rock  type  abundant  in 
many  areas,  is  generally  rich  in  biotite  and  poor  in 


hornblende.  All  are  medium  grained. 

The  largest  Mesozoic  granitic  intrusion  crops  out 
over  an  area  of  about  75  square  miles  in  the  central 
part  of  the  range.  There  is  complete  gradation  from 
quartz  dioritc  to  quartz  monzonitc  within  the  pluton, 
but  the  most  abundant  rock  is  probably  granodioritc. 
On  the  west,  the  intrusion  forms  a  sharp,  nearly 
vertical,  north-trending  contact  with  the  Lowe  Grano- 
dioritc and  shows  little  evidence  of  stoping  or  assim- 
ilation. On  the  east,  it  has  an  irregular  contact  with 
large  areas  in  which  the  adjoining  rocks  are  brecciated 
or  plasticall\'  deformed  and  intricate!)-  intruded  by 
granitic  material.  Associated  granitic  aplite  and  peg- 
matite dikes  are  abundant  in  the  terrane  cast  of  the 
pluton  but  absent  from  the  terrane  to  the  west.  The 
southern  part  of  the  pluton  has  been  offset  westward 
along  the  San  Gabriel  fault.  It  is  exposed  in  the  vicin-

east-west  across  the  western  part  of  the  range  a  short 
distance  north  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault.  Angular  inclu- 
sions of  wall  rock  are  locally  abundant  along  the 
margins  of  the  plutons,  suggesting  emplacement  by 
stoping.  The  composition  of  the  plutons  ranges  from 
quartz  diorite  to  quartz  monzonite  with  granodiorite 
most  abundant.  An  age  of  about  80  million  years  has 
been  determined  for  granodiorite  from  one  of  the  plu- 
tons (Carter,  1971). 

Foliated  quartz  diorite  and  granodiorite  are  abund- 
ant in  areas  containing  Paleozoic  (?)  metasedimentary 
rocks.  They  appear  to  have  provided  the  heat  required 
to  convert  the  sedimentary-  rocks  into  gneiss  and  mig- 
matite.  Quartz  diorite  from  Ontario  Peak  in  the  eastern 
part  of  the  range  has  been  dated  at  about  105  million 
years  using  the  rubidium-strontium  method  (Hsu  et  al, 
1963). 

Pelona  Schist 

About  10,000  feet  of  Pelona  Schist  crops  out  in  a 
southwest-dipping,  right-side-up  sequence  between  the 
San  Jacinto  fault  and  the  Vincent  thrust  fault  as  de- 
scribed by  Ehlig  (1958,  p.  83-133;  1968,  p.  295-297). 
Metamorphism  occurred  under  low-temperature  dyna- 
mothermal  conditions  producing  highly  developed 
schistosity  parallel  to  bedding.  The  dominant  schist 
type  is  composed  of  quartz,  albite,  and  muscovite  with 
minor  amounts  of  epidote,  actinolite,  and  chlorite.  It 
is  gray  because  of  finely  disseminated  graphite;  it  has 
been  derived  from  sandstone,  siltstone,  and  shale. 
Green  albite-epidote-chlorite-actinolite  schist,  derived 
from  basaltic  tuff,  is  common  in  the  upper  part  of  the 
sequence.  Quartzite  derived  from  chert  is  a  minor 
rock  type. 

Metamorphism  of  the  Pelona  Schist  is  interpreted 
to  have  occurred  during  the  Late  Cretaceous  simul- 
taneously ^\ith  movement  along  the  Vincent  thrust 
(Ehlig,  1959;  1968,  p.  297-298).  The  depositional  age 
of  the  Pelona  Schist  is  not  kno\\n;  however,  the  fact 
that  it  is  of  low  metamorphic  grade  with  a  simple 
metamorphic  history  and  is  not  intruded  by  Mesozoic 
granitic  rocks  suggests  that  deposition  may  have  oc- 
curred only  shortly  before  metamorphism. 

The  Pelona  Schist  forming  Blue  Ridge  to  the 
north  of  the  San  Jacinto  fault  contains  the  same  lith- 
ology  as  that  to  the  south  but  differs  in  detail.  It  is 
believed  to  have  been  displaced  from  Sierra  Pelona 
by  about  25  miles  of  right-slip  along  the  San  Jacinto 
fault  (Dibblee,  1967,  p.  114;  Ehlig,  1968,  p.  301). 

Paleozoic(?)  Metasediments  and  Associated  Gneiss 
and  Migmatite 

The  crystalline  rocks  in  the  southwestern  part  of 
the  range,  south  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault,  consist 
mainly  of  intermixed  quartz  diorite,  granodiorite, 
gneiss,  and  migmatite.  These  rocks  have  a  simple  min- 
eralogy- consisting  of  various  combinations  of  quartz, 
plagioclase,  orthoclase,  biotite,  and  hornblende.  The 
migmatite,    gneiss,    and    amphibolite    were    metamor-

phosed  to  their  existing  condition  during  intrusion  of 
the  quartz  diorite  and  granodiorite  and  show  no  evi- 
dence of  an  earlier  metamorphism. 

Rocks  of  obvious  sedimentary  origin  occur  in 
scattered  remnants  within  this  terrane.  These  include 
marble,  bedded  calc-silicate  rocks,  quartzite,  graphite 
schist,  and  aluminous  schist.  The  metasedimentary 
rocks  most  commonl\'  occur  interlayered  with  gneiss 
or  as  lenses  and  pods  in  migmatite.  This  suggests  the 
possibility  that  the  gneiss  and  migmatite  were  also 
derived  from  sedimentary  rocks. 

Similar  relationships  exist  in  the  eastern  part  of 
the  range  east  of  the  San  Antonio  fault.  However,  the 
metasedimentary  rocks  are  better  preserved.  A  section 
containing  1 5  members  \\ith  a  total  thickness  of  about 
7300  feet  has  been  delineated  along  the  west  side  of 
Ontario  Ridge  (Ehlig,  1958,  p.  51-57).  The  original 
lithology  included  quartz  sandstone,  dolomite,  siltstone, 
and  shale. 

The  terrane  north  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  is 
extensively  migmatized;  however,  mappable  marble 
units  are  well  preserved.  One  unit  several  hundred 
feet  thick  is  exposed  for  a  distance  of  6  miles. 

There  is  no  direct  evidence  that  the  metasedimen- 
tary rocks  are  Paleozoic.  However,  in  each  of  the 
three  areas,  the  rocks  appear  to  have  undergone  a 
single  major  metamorphism  associated  with  intrusion 
of  Mesozoic  granitic  rocks.  There  is  no  evidence  of 
a  complex  history  like  that  experienced  b_\'  Precam- 
brian  rocks  of  the  central  and  western  San  Gabriel 
Mountains.  In  addition,  the  lithology  of  the  metasedi- 
mentary rocks  is  grossly  similar  to  that  of  fossiliferous 
Paleozoic  rocks  in  eastern  California. 

GEOLOGIC  STRUCTURE 

Transverse  Range  Problems 

The  origin  of  the  east-west  trend  of  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains,  as  well  as  the  other  Transverse 
Ranges,  is  a  major  tectonic  problem.  Is  the  trend  in- 
herited from  the  structure  of  the  pre-Cenozoic  crys- 
talline rocks  that  underlie  the  range,  or  is  it  a  young 
feature  superimposed  upon  the  older  structures?  Also,

what  controls  the  boundaries  of  the  range  and  the 
mechanics  of  its  uplift?  The  answers  to  these  questions 
are  prerequisites  t&lt;i  the  development  of  a  reliable  model 
for  predicting  the  location,  nature,  and  intensity  of 
faulting  and  earthquakes  associated  with  range  uplift. 
Partial  answers  can  be  obtained  through  a  detailed 
reconstruction  of  the  structural  histor\-  of  the  rocks 
exposed  within  the  range.  Considerable  progress  has 
been  made,  but  the  results  are  still  sketchy. 

Structure  Shown  by  Foliation 

The  abundance  of  igneous  intrusions  and  the  in- 
termingling of  igneous  and  mctamorphic  rocks  have 
created  a  complex  structure  within  much  of  the  range. 
However,  most  of  the  rocks  show  foliation  in  rela- 
tivel\-  simple  patterns.  The  orientation  of  foliation 
varies  considerabl\-  from  place  to  place  but  most  typ- 
icalK'  strikes  northwestward  at  about  45  degrees  to  the 
long  axis  of  the  range.  Foliation  in  the  east-central  part 
of  the  range  tends  to  dip  southwestward  at  moderate 
angles,  whereas  that  in  the  west-central  and  western 
parts  tends  to  be  nearl\'  vertical  or  steeply  inclined 
toward  the  east.  Foliation  in  the  southeastern  part  of 
the  range  differs  notabl\'  from  that  in  most  other  areas; 
it  tends  to  strike  nearly  due  east  and  dip  northward 
at  moderate  to  high  angles. 

Vincent  Thrust  Fault 

Possibly  the  most  important  structural  feature  in- 


fluencing the  distribution  of  rocks  at  depth  is  the 
V'inccnt  thrust  fault.  The  thrust  is  e.xposed  in  the 
northeastern  part  of  the  range  where  it  has  displaced 
Mesozoic  granitic  and  older  rocks  northeastward 
across  the  top  of  the  Pelona  Schist.  The  e.xposed 
thrust  dips  southwestward  at  about  30  degrees.  Bed- 
ding in  the  undcri\ing  Pelona  Schist  is  nearly  parallel 
to  the  thrust  surface  in  most  areas.  In  view  of  this 
and  the  fact  that  erosion  has  exposed  about  10,000 
feet  of  schist  without  uncovering  its  base,  the  schist 
ma\-  extend  a  considerable  distance  to  the  south  and 
west  beneath  the  thrust.  To  put  it  another  way,  as 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  are  eroded  downward,  the 
area  of  schist  outcrop  will  expand  southward  and 
westward.  Fven  if  the  schist  extends  only  a  few  miles 
southw  ard  beneath  the  thrust,  the  thick  zone  of  mylon- 
itic  rocks  along  the  base  of  the  thrust's  upper  plate 
must  continue  beneath  all  or  most  of  the  eastern  part 
of  the  range.  The  displacement  along  the  thrust  is  not 
less  than  10  miles  and  is  probably  much  greater  than 
that.  The  reconstruction  of  the  initial  position  of 
Pelona  Schist  exposed  north  of  the  San  Jacinto  fault 
indicates  that  it  originally  extended  along  the  entire 
north  side  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  and  connected 
to  the  schist  exposed  on  Sierra  Pelona  to  the  west 
(Ehlig,  1968,  p.  301).  In  this  reconstruction,  the  Vin- 
cent thrust  would  also  extend  along  the  north  side  of 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  and  connect  with  an  equiv-

alent  thrust  along  the  southern  margin  of  the  Sierra 
Pelona. 

Mylonitic  zones  which  may  be  extensions  of  the 
Vincent  thrust  are  exposed  in  three  other  areas  within 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Mylonitic  rocks  about 
1000  feet  thick  are  exposed  in  an  area  of  about  2 
square  miles  south  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault  in  the  cen- 
tral part  of  the  range.  These  rocks  are  very  similar 
to  those  of  the  Vincent  thrust  and  would  be  very  close 
to  the  exposed  position  of  the  thrust  if  the  strike-slip 
displacement  along  the  San  Gabriel  fault  could  be  re- 
moved. 

Several  hundred  feet  of  mylonitic  rocks  are  ex- 
posed beneath  anorthosite  and  related  rocks  in  Mill 
Canyon  in  the  western  part  of  the  range  (Carter, 
1971).  The  upper  part  of  the  mylonitic  sequence  is 
derived  from  anorthosite,  but  the  lower  part  is  derived 
from  amphibolite  and  granodiorite  which  are  different 
from  any  other  rocks  exposed  in  nearby  areas.  Thus 
it  appears  that  the  anorthosite  complex  is  underlain  by 
a  major  thrust  fault,  perhaps  an  upward  arched  seg- 
ment of  the  Vincent  thrust. 

A  thick  sequence  of  rocks,  mostly  mylonite,  crops 
out  in  a  northward-dipping,  east-striking  belt  near  the 
southeast  margin  of  the  range  east  of  the  San  Antonio 
fault.  These  rocks  have  been  investigated  by  Alf 
(1948)  and  Hsu  (1955),  but  their  tectonic  significance 
has  not  been  determined.  Several  miles  north,  similar 
mylonites  occur  in  the  upper  part  of  the  thick  se- 
quence of  south\\ard-dipping  mylonitic  rocks  along 
the  Vincent  thrust.  In  both  areas,  the  mylonites  cut 
Mesozoic  granitic  rocks  and  could  be  the  same  age. 
Perhaps  the  belt  of  mylonite  near  the  southeastern 
margin  of  the  range  is  the  down-dip  extension  of  the 
Vincent  thrust  which  has  been  tilted  and  uplifted  into 
its  present  position  by  Cenozoic  deformation. 

Geophysical  studies  might  help  to  trace  subsurface 
extent  of  the  Vincent  thrust  and  the  thrust  faults 
that  produced  the  mylonite  exposed  in  Mill  Canyon 
and  in  the  southeastern  part  of  the  range.  Perhaps  the 
igneous  and  metamorphic  rocks  that  form  the  bulk  of 
the  exposures  within  the  range  terminate  downward 


against  a  thrust  fault.  Significantly  different  rocks  may 
be  present  at  the  depths  where  earthquakes  originate. 

Cenozoic  Faults 

The  San  Gabriel  Mountains  owe  their  bold  south- 
ern front  to  Quaternary  uplift  along  a  system  of 
reverse  faults  collectively  referred  to  as  the  Sierra 
Madre  fault  system.  In  addition  to  these  faults,  several 
major  high-angle  faults  transect  the  range  without  di- 
rectly influencing  the  range's  configuration.  The  most 
prominent  include  the  San  Gabriel,  San  Jacinto,  and 
San  Andreas  faults,  all  of  which  strike  between  north- 
west and  west  and  appear  to  have  right-lateral  dis- 
placements of  man\'  miles.  Next  in  prominence  are 
a  number  of  northeast-striking  faults  which  appear  to 
have  both  vertical  and  left-slip  along  them.  The  most 
important  of  these  are  the  Soledad  fault  along  the 
northwest  margin  of  the  range  and  the  San  Antonio 
fault  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  range. 

Minor  faults  with  displacements  of  a  few  inches 
to  tens  of  feet  are  common  throughout  the  range  but 
appear  to  have  little  influence  upon  the  distribution 
of  rock  units.  Many  result  from  slippage  along  pre- 
existing joints  and  probably  accommodate  changes  in 
shape  brought  about  by  distortion  of  the  brittle  rocks. 

San  Gabriel  Fault 

The  San  Gabriel  fault  enters  the  western  San 
Gabriel  Mountains  east  of  Newhall  and  trends  south 
65  degrees  east  across  the  southwestern  part  of  the 
range  to  Big  Tujunga  Canyon  where  it  splits  into  a 
northern  branch  and  a  southern  branch.  The  northern 
branch  continues  eastward  for  12  miles  along  a  trend 
of  about  south  70  degrees  east  and  then  bends  nearly 
due  east  and  extends  across  the  center  of  the  range 
to  the  community  of  Mount  Baldy  where  it  is  trun- 
cated by  the  San  Antonio  fault.  The  trace  of  the 
northern  branch  is  well  marked  by  major  canyons 
w  hich  have  been  eroded  along  it.  The  southern  branch 
trends  south  50  degrees  east  from  Big  Tujunga  Can- 
yon to  the  front  of  the  range  above  Altadena  where 
it  bends  eastward  and  becomes  entwined  with  the  sys-

tern  of  frontal  faults.  It  is  generally  believed  to  con- 
tinue eastward  along  the  range  front,  but  perhaps  it 
trends  southeastward  into  the  San  Gabriel  Valle&gt; 
concealed  beneath  a  mantle  of  alluvium.  The  southern 
branch  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault  is  frequently  referred 
to  as  the  Sierra  Madrc  fault;  however,  as  used  here, 
the  "Sierra  .Madre  fault"  refers  exclusively  to  the  sys- 
tem of  reverse  faults  along  the  southern  margin  of  the 
range. 

Crowe!!  (1952,  1962,  1968)  has  presented  evidence 
indicating  that  the  segment  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault 
which  extends  northwestward  from  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  has  a  total  right-lateral  displacement  of 
about  30  miles,  of  w  hich  about  20  miles  has  occurred 
since  late  Miocene  time.  If  the  rocks  were  returned  to 
their  presumed  original  positions,  gneiss  similar  in  ori- 
gin and  histor\-  to  the  Mcndenhall  Gneiss,  but  pres- 
entl\-  exposed  along  the  west  side  of  the  fault  south 
of  Gorman,  would  be  placed  next  to  the  Mendenhall 
Gneiss  in  the  southwest  corner  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains.  This  would  rectify  the  existing  mismatch 
of  crystalline  rocks  across  the  San  Gabriel  fault  in  the 
western  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  .\s  presently  seen, 
Precambrian  Mendenhall  Gneiss  on  the  north  side  of 
the  fault  is  only  mildl\-  affected  by  Mesozoic  meta- 
morphism;  whereas.  Paleozoic  (?)  metasedimentary 
rocks  on  the  south  side  arc  intricately  intruded  by 
Mesozoic  granitic  rocks  and  largely  converted  to 
gneiss  and  migmatite. 

Within  the  central  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  the 
northern  branch  of  the  fault  has  a  net  right-slip  of 
about  14  miles  as  shown  by  the  offset  of  the  vertical 
western  margin  of  the  Lowe  Granodiorite.  If  the  rocks 
along  the  north  branch  were  returned  to  their  prefault 
position,  the  south  branch  of  the  fault  would  split  off 
very  close  to  the  20-degree  bend  in  the  trace  of  the 
north  branch  and  would  be  in  alignment  w ith  the  trace 
further  west.  This  suggests  that  the  bend  in  the  north 
branch  may  be  an  original  feature  produced  by  the 
intersection  of  two  faults. 

West  of  where  the  San  Gabriel  fault  splits  into 
two  branches,  rocks  on  opposite  sides  of  the  fault  are 
mismatched.  Removal  of  14  miles  of  right-slip  along 
the  north  branch,  so  as  to  place  rocks  in  their  original 
position,  fails  to  improve  the  match  west  of  the  split. 
Dip-slip  faulting  does  not  appear  to  provide  a  solution. 
The  \-oungcst  tcrranc  is  on  the  south  side  of  the  fault, 
suggesting  the  south  side  has  moved  down  relative  to 
the  north  side.  However,  Mesozoic  rocks  imply  the 
opposite  sense  of  movement.  Granitic  rocks  on  the 
south  side  are  coarser  grained  and  more  mafic  than 
those  on  the  north  and  have  extensivcl\'  migmatized 
the  rocks  they  intrude,  whereas  those  on  the  north 
have  onl\'  niildl\-  affected  the  rocks  the\'  intrude.  Thus, 
strike-slip  faulting  appears  to  provide  the  most  plau- 
sible explanation  for  the  mismatch.  If  the  net  right- 
slip  is  about  30  miles  (Crowcll,  1968,  p.  327),  the  net 
right-slip  along  the  southern  branch  of  the  fault  should 
be  about  16  miles  and  rocks  in  the  southwest  corner 
of  the  range  should  have  been  adjacent  to  those  along 
the  southern  branch  of  the  fault  prior  to  faulting.  This 
would  improve  the  match  of  Mesozoic  granitic  rocks, 
hut  the  ol^er  rocks  would  still  be  mismatched.  Perhaps 


the  differences  could  be  explained  by  dip-slip  displace- 
ment with  the  south  side  down,  or  perhaps  the  right- 
slip  along  the  southern  branch  of  the  fault  is  more  than 
16  miles. 

The  San  Gabriel  fault  was  nearly  continuously 
active  from  late  Oligocene  to  the  Pleistocene  as  shown 
bv  data  collected  northwest  of  the  range  bv  Crowell 
(1952,  1962,  1968).  Rocks  within  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  provide  limited  data  on  the  timing  of  dis- 
placements. The  earliest  faulting  predated  the  intru- 
sion of  middle  Miocene  dikes  in  the  central  part  of 
the  range.  The  dikes  are  locally  concentrated  along 
the  northern  branch  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault,  and  a 
few  occur  along  the  southern  branch.  Although  the 
dikes  are  commonly  disrupted  by  younger  faulting, 
in  some  places  they  clearly  intrude  intensely  sheared 
rocks,  and  baked  fault  gouge  occurs  locally  along  their 
margins. 

In  the  western  part  of  the  range,  Pliocene  con- 
glomerates south  of  the  fault  are  displaced  from  their 
source  areas  north  of  the  fault.  Conglomerate  at  the 
top  of  the  lower  Pliocene  marine  section,  which  crops 
out  west  of  the  mouth  of  Big  Tujunga  Canyon,  con- 
tains clasts  of  Lowe  Granodiorite  and  cataclastic  .Men- 
denhall Gneiss  similar  to  that  exposed  between  Straw- 
berr\-  Peak  and  Devil's  Canyon  in  the  central  part  of 
the  range.  The  conglomerate  lacks  clasts  of  anorthosite 
and  Mendenhall  Gneiss  of  the  types  which  occur 
across  the  fault  from  the  conglomerate's  present  posi- 
tion. A  right-slip  of  12  to  18  miles  is  indicated  if 
sediment  transport  was  from  north  to  south.  The  dis- 
placement might  be  as  little  as  6  to  8  miles  if  sediment 
transport  was  more  nearly  east  to  west. 

A  sliver  of  fossiliferous  Pliocene  marine  sandstone 
(Pml  on  the  Geologic  Map  of  California)  occurs 
along  the  San  Gabriel  fault  in  Gold  Canyon,  1  Yz 
miles  west  of  Big  Tujunga  Canyon.  A  gravel  lens 
W'ithin  it  is  composed  of  pebbles  and  cobbles  of  Lowe 
Granodiorite.  No  clasts  of  anorthosite  or  .Mendenhall 
Gneiss  were  observed.  The  closest  possible  source  area 
is  on  the  north  side  of  the  southern  branch  of  the 
fault,  7  miles  to  the  east.  The  furthest  possible  source 
area  is  more  than  20  miles  to  the  east.  .\  right-slip  of 
7  miles  would  be  the  minimum  displacement  along  the 
southern  branch  of  the  fault  and  would  not  include 
contemporaneous  movement  along  the  northern  branch. 

Middle-to-uppcr  Pliocene  marine  conglomerate 
crops  out  east  of  Newhall,  north  and  west  of  the 
entrance  to  Placerita  Can\on  State  Park,  and  less  than 
a  mile  south  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault.  The  conglom- 
erate contains  small  subangular  clasts  of  .Mendenhall 
Gneiss,  anorthosite,  and  gabbro.  The  closest  possible 
source  is  along  the  north  side  of  the  fault  about  4 
miles  to  the  east,  and  the  furthest  possible  source  is 
about  12  miles  to  the  cast.  The  area  directly  across 
the  fault  is  underlain  by  .Miocene  and  Pliocene  sedi- 
mentary rocks  containing  round  clasts  of  man\-  differ- 
ent rock  t\pes,  thus  precluding  it  as  a  source  area. 

Lower  Pleistocene  alluvial  sediments  of  the  Sau- 
gus  Formation  are  faulted  and  strongly  deformed 
where  tiie\'  occur  along  the  soutii  side  of  the  San 
Ciabriel  fault  in  Little  Tujunga  Can\on,  but  there  is 
little  evidence  for  major  strike-slip  faulting.

The  Glen  Helen  fault,  within  the  San  Jacinto 
fault  zone  enters  the  east  end  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  with  a  strike  of  about  north  45  degrees 
west.  It  cuts  across  ridge  spurs  along  the  cast  side  of 
Lytle  Creek,  gradually  curving  so  as  to  strike  about 
north  60  degrees  west  where  it  enters  the  canyon 
bottom  near  Glen  Ranch.  From  there,  the  San  Jacinto 
fault  extends  along  the  bottom  of  Lytle  Creek  to  the 
drainage  divide  and  thence  along  the  bottom  of  Prairie 
Fork  of  the  San  Gabriel  River  to  Vincent  Gap  where 
its  strike  is  about  north  65  degrees  west.  From  Vincent 
Gap  it  continues  westward  across  the  drainage  of  Big 
Rock  Creek  for  about  10  miles  and  then  curves  to 
within  half  a  mile  of  the  San  Andreas  fault;  this  seg- 
ment of  the  San  Jacinto  fault  is  referred  to  as  the 
Punchbowl  fault  on  the  Geologic  Map  of  California. 
West  of  its  convergence  with  the  San  Andreas  fault, 
it  is  essentially  part  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  zone,  pos- 
sibly representing  the  most  southerly  major  break 
which  is  called  the  Nadeau  fault. 

Southeast  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  the  San 
Jacinto  fault  has  been  very  active  in  recent  time  as 
attested  to  by  several  historic  earthquakes  and  abun- 
dant topographic  evidence  of  surface  faulting.  Recent 
displacement  has  been  primarily  right-lateral.  A  total 
right-lateral  displacement  of  about  15  miles  has  oc- 
curred along  the  fault  within  the  Peninsular  Ranges  of 
southern  California  (Sharp,  1967,  p.  717). 

Within  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  topography 
along  the  San  Jacinto  fault  is  erosional  in  origin.  There 
is  no  obvious  topographic  evidence  of  recent  displace- 
ment such  as  that  seen  along  the  San  Andreas  fault  to 
the  north.  Perhaps  recent  displacements  along  the  San 
Jacinto  fault  south  of  the  range  have  been  accommo- 
dated by  movement  along  the  San  Andreas  fault 
within  the  range. 

A  total  right-slip  of  about  25  miles  appears  to 
have  occurred  along  the  San  Jacinto  fault  within  the 
San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Dibblee  (1967,  p.  114)  has 
correlated  the  fault  separating  Pelona  Schist  of  Blue 
Ridge  from  granitic  rocks  of  Pinyon  Ridge  in  the 
northeastern  part  of  the  range  with  a  similar  fault 
along  the  north  side  of  Sierra  Pelona  west  of  the  range. 
My  own  studies  indicate  the  Pelona  Schist  of  Blue 
Ridge  is  similar  to  that  of  Sierra  Pelona;  and  the  Pe- 
lona Schist,  \'incent-thrust  rocks,  and  intrusions  of 
quartz-monzonite  porphyry  exposed  in  the  Crafton 
Hills  east  of  Redlands  are  similar  to  those  in  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains  south  of  the  San  Jacinto  fault 
(Ehlig,  1968,  p.  301).  The  apparent  difference  in  dis- 
placement within  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  as  com- 
pared to  that  in  the  Peninsular  Ranges  may  be  ac- 
counted for  by  movement  on  the  Banning  fault  or 
other  faults  within  the  San  Andreas  fault  system. 

San  Andreas  Fault 

The  San  Andreas  fault  strikes  north  64  degrees 


west  in  a  nearly  straight  line  along  the  northern  edge 
of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Offset  drainage  channels 
fault  line  troughs,  sag  ponds,  pressure  ridges,  and 
scarps  provide  abundant  evidence  of  recent  move- 
ment. The  principal  component  of  Quaternary  dis- 
placement is  right-lateral.  V^ertical  displacement  is  com- 
mon but  changes  along  the  fault  trace  and  lacks  regional 
consistency.  In  fact,  the  San  Andreas  fault  extends 
from  low  terrain  in  Cajon  Pass  to  high  terrain  in  the 
Wrightwood-Big  Pines  area  and  back  down  to  low 
terrain  near  Valyermo  without  obviously  influencing 
the  broad-scale  topography.  This  suggests  (1)  that 
the  mechanism  of  range  uplift  is  independent  of  the 
position  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  and  (2)  that  uplift 
and  erosion  are  rapid  enough  to  mask  the  effect  of 
lateral  offset  of  topography  by  slippage  along  the 
San  Andreas. 

Evidence  for  displacement  along  the  San  Andreas 
fault  has  been  reviewed  by  Crowell  (1962).  A  net 
right-slip  of  130  miles  is  suggested  by  the  fact  that 
the  Orocopia  .Mountains  (north  of  the  San  Andreas 
fault  in  southeastern  California)  contain  rocks  similar 
in  origin,  history,  and  age  to  those  in  the  western  San 
Gabriel  Alountains  south  of  the  fault  (Crowell  and 
Walker,  1962;  Silver,  1971).  For  the  purposes  of  this 
report,  it  is  important  to  note  that  crystalline  rocks 
to  the  north  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  are  unlike  those 
to  the  south  along  the  entire  length  of  the  San  Ga- 
briel Mountains. 

Soledad  Fault 

The  Soledad  fault  is  traceable  for  a  distance  of 
about  10  miles  along  the  north  side  of  Soledad  Canyon 
at  the  west  end  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  midwa&gt;' 
between  the  San  Gabriel  and  San  Andreas  faults.  It 
has  an  average  trend  of  north  75  degrees  east  and  dips 
steeply  toward  the  north  but  is  deformed  and  is  offset 
by  several  younger  faults  (Oakeshott,  1958,  p.  95; 
Carter  and  Silver,  1971).  Major  dip-slip  displacement 
occurred  along  it  between  lata  Eocene  and  early 
Miocene  allowing  several  thousand  feet  of  volcanic 
and  clastic  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Vasquez  Forma- 
tion to  accumulate  in  the  Soledad  Basin  north  of  the 
fault  synchronous  with  uplift  and  erosion  of  plutonic 
rocks  to  the  south  (Jahns  and  Muehlberger,  1954). 
Movement  along  the  Soledad  fault  ceased  around 
mid-Miocene  time.  During  the  upper  Miocene,  the 
Mint  Can\'on  Formation  was  deposited  on  top  of  the 
Soledad  fault,  thus  concealing  it.  Erosion  combined 
with  regional  tilting  toward  the  west  has  exposed  the 
Soledad  fault  eastward  from  the  base  of  the  .Mint 
Canyon  Formation.  Near  its  easternmost  exposure, 
plutonic  rocks  crop  out  on  both  sides  of  the  fault. 
Further  to  the  east,  the  Soledad  fault  is  concealed 
beneath  allu\ium  in  Soledad  Canyon  and  its  exact 
position  has  not  been  determined. 

The  Soledad  fault  is  ofen  selected  as  the  north- 
western boundary  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  This 
is  an  arbitrary  choice  in  that  there  has  been  no  fault 
movement  during  the  major  epoch  of  range  uplift. 
Differences  in  topograph}-  across  it  are  the  result  of 
differential  erosion.  Where  plutonic  rocks  crop  out  on 
both  sides,  there  is  little  contrast  in  topography  across 
it.

San  Antonio  Fault 

The  San  Antonia  fault  extends  northeastward 
along  San  Antonio  Canyon  (Wash)  in  the  eastern 
part  of  the  range.  It  is  truncated  b&gt;'  the  San  Jacinto 
fault  on  the  north  and  appears  to  curve  \\cst\vard  and 
form  part  of  the  frontal  fault  svsteni  on  the  south. 
Rocks  of  different  origin  and  histor\-  arc  juxtaposed 
along  all  but  the  northern  part  of  its  trace  where 
there  is  Pelona  Schist  on  both  sides.  The  granitic- 
gncissic  complex  of  the  central  San  Gabriel  Mountains 
is  exposed  on  the  west  side.  The  northern  part  of  the 
complex  has  been  mylonitized  and  partially  recrystal- 
iized  where  it  overlies  Pelona  Sciiist  along  the  Vincent 
thrust  fault.  The  complex  probably  represents  Pre- 
cambrian  crust  modified  by  Alesozoic  intrusion  and 
metamorphism. 

The  area  east  of  the  San  Antonio  fault  is  underlain 
by  Paleozoic  (?)  metasedimentary  rocks  intruded  and 
metamorphosed  by  Mesozoic  granitic  rocks.  A  belt  of 
cataclastic  rocks  and  mylonite,  several  thousand  feet 
thick,  extends  nearly  due  east  cross  this  terrane  in  the 
southern  part  of  the  range.  Rocks  south  of  the  mylo- 
nite belt  iiave,  in  part,  undergone  granuiite-facies 
metamorphism,  \\'hereas  those  to  the  north  are  entirely 
of  amphibolite  facics.  In  the  northern  part  of  the  area, 
several  thousand  feet  of  mylonitic  rocks  overlie  the 
Pelona  Schist  along  tlie  Vincent  thrust  fault. 

Relationships  along  the  San  Antonio  fault  appear 
to  require  a  large  strike-slip  displacement.  Simple  dip- 
slip  displacement  can  be  ruled  out  because  of  the 
following  relationships: 

1.  The  northern  branch  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault, 
which  is  essentially  vertical  and  has  about  14  miles  of 
right-slip  along  it,  is  truncated  along  the  west  side  of 
the  San  .Antonio  fault.  The  nearest  fault  on  the  cast 
side  is  in  Icehouse  Canyon  2  miles  north.  Rocks  along 
this  Icehouse  Canyon  fault  are  different  from  those 
along  the  San  Gabriel  fault. 

2.  Although  the  \'incent  thrust  fault  is  exposed 
on  both  sides  of  the  San  Antonio  fault,  mylonitic  rocks 
on  the  east  side  are  several  times  thicker  than  those  on 
tiie  west  and  contain  rocks  of  metasedimentary  origin 
whereas  those  to  the  west  do  not.  Thus  the  two 
m\lonitic  sequences  could  not  have  formed  side  by 
side. 

3.  The  mylonite  belt  which  occurs  on  the  east 
side  near  the  front  of  the  range  has  no  counterpart 
on  the  west  side. 

About  3  miles  of  left-slip  appears  to  have  occurred 
along  a  branch  of  the  San  Antonio  fault,  a  sequence 
of  metascdimentar\-  rocks  is  exposed  in  Evey  Canyon 
l)et\\  ccn  two  branches  of  the  San  .Antonio  fault  near 
the  front  of  the  range.  What  appears  to  be  the  same 
sequence  of  rocks  is  exposed  to  the  east  of  the  fault 
near  Cascade  Canyon,  3  miles  to  the  north.  In  both 
areas,  the  rocks  dip  steeply  toward  the  north  and  strike 
nearly  perpendicular  to  the  San  Antonio  fault. 

Sierra  Madre  Fault  System 

The  Sierra  .Madre  fault  system,  as  referred  to  here, 
includes  all  faults  along  the  southern  front  of  the  San 
Gabriel  .Mountains  that  have  participated  in  the  Qua- 
ternary uplift  of  the  range.  The  fault  system  is  signifi- 


cantl\-  more  complex  than  is  suggested  by  the  rela- 
tively simple,  bold  southern  face  of  the  range.  It 
appears  to  be  broken  into  five  or  six  segments,  each 
10  to  15  miles  long  and  composed  of  numerous  indi- 
vidual faults.  Several  of  the  faults  curve  into  the  range 
even  thougli  the  continuity  of  topography  within  the 
range  indicates  the  entire  range  has  been  uplifted 
essentially  as  a  single  block.  The  complexit\-  appears 
to  be  due  to  a  combination  of  four  factors:  (1)  con- 
trol of  frontal  faults  by  pre-existing  faults,  (2)  restric- 
tion of  movement  to  a  single  segment  during  each 
individual  carrh(]uake,  (3)  splaying  of  the  movement- 
zone  as  it  approaches  the  surface,  and  (4)  deformation 
or  rotation  of  fault  surfaces  into  orientations  unfavor- 
able for  recurrent  movement.  Limited  exposures  indi- 
cate that  the  frontal  faults  generally  dip  30  to  70 
degrees  northward  under  the  range. 

The  San  Fernando  earthquake  resulted  from 
movement  along  the  San  Fernando-Sunland  segment 
of  the  Sierra  .Madre  fault  system.  This  segment  is 
about  12  miles  long,  extending  from  Big  Tujunga 
Canyon  on  the  east  to  the  join  between  the  San  Ga- 
briel Mountains  and  the  Santa  Susana  Mountains  on 
the  west.  The  earthquake  was  initiated  b\'  sudden 
slippage  at  a  depth  of  8  miles  beneath  a  point  I'A 
miles  northeast  of  the  trace  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault 
and  directly  beneath  the  surface  contact  bersveen  the 
crystalline  rocks  and  sedimentar\-  rocks  of  the  Soledad 
Basin.  From  there,  the  slippage  propagated  southward 
and  upward  along  a  surface  inclined  at  about  45  de- 
grees and  striking  west-northwest  (.Allen,  Hanks,  and 
\\'hitcomb,  this  bulletin).  Faulting  broke  the  ground 
surface  along  the  south  limb  of  the  Little  Tujunga 
s\ncline.  Details  of  surface  faulting  and  geolog\-  are 
presented  b\-  Kahlc  ct  ill.  plates  2  and  3.  In  general,  the 
near-surface  movement  followed  a  \oung  fault  zone 
that  developed  parallel  to  bedding  in  the  underKing 
sedimentary  rocks.  The  surface  displacement  includes 
both  rever.se-slip  with  the  nortii  side  up  and  left-slip. 

The  earthquake  caused  no  movement  along  the 
prominent  fault  zone  separating  exposed  basement 
rocks  from  sedimentar\-  rocks  along  the  northern  limb 
of  the  Little  Tujunga  syncline.  As  I  interpret  the 
geology,  reverse  faulting  began  along  the  range  front 
during  Pliocene-Pleistocene  time  and  was  accompanied 
by  downfolding  of  the  Little  Tujunga  syncline  along 
the  fault's  leading  edge.  .As  a  result  of  the  faulting, 
the  prism  of  basement  rock  exposed  between  the  San 
Gabriel  fault  and  the  Little  Tujunga  syncline  was  de- 
tached from  its  roots.  .As  reverse  faulting  continued  at 
depth,  near-surface  crustal  shortening  was  assimilated 
by  synclinal  folding  of  the  sedimentary  rocks  and 
backward  rotation  of  the  detached  prism  of  basement 
rock.  In  relatively  recent  time,  the  Little  Tujunga 
s\ncline  has  become  tight  and  more  resistant  to  fold- 
ing. As  a  result,  the  reverse  faulting  has  extended 
across  the  axial  surface  of  the  svncline  and  has  prop- 
agated upward  along  bedding  planes  within  the  south- 
ern limb  of  the  syncline. 

The  eastern  and  western  limits  of  faulting  during 
the  San  Fernando  earthquake  coincide  with  disconti- 
nuities in  the  pattern  of  frontal  faults.  Tlie  eastern  limit 
is  along  the  bottom  of  Big  Tujunga  Canyon.  As  the 


1974 


San  Fernando  Earthquake — Geology  and  Geophysics 


17 


frontal  faults  approach  the  mouth  of  the  canyon  from 
either  side,  they  curve  back  into  the  range.  Bedding 
within  sedimentary  rocks  adjoining  the  faults  has  been 
upturned  so  as  to  strike  parallel  to  the  faults.  As  a 
result,  sedimentary  rocks  on  opposite  sides  of  the  can- 
yon strike  nearly  at  right  angles  to  each  other.  Al- 
though the  western  limit  of  faulting  is  not  marked  b\' 
surface  ruptures,  a  linear  array  of  aftershocks  (Allen 
and  others,  1971)  occurred  along  the  zone  of  defor- 
mation and  tear  faults  developed,  separating  the  struc- 
tures of  the  southwestern  San  Gabriel  iMountains  from 
the  thrust  faults  and  folds  of  the  Santa  Susana  Moun- 
tains to  the  \\est.  This  suggests  that  the  San  Fernando- 
Sunland  segment  of  the  frontal  fault  system  is  a 
structural  unit  and  that  earthquakes  produced  by  its 
displacement  are  triggered  at  different  times  than 
earthquakes  produced  by  displacements  along  adjoin- 
ing segments  of  the  frontal  fault  system. 

The  segment  of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  system  ex- 
tending from  Big  Tujunga  Canyon  eastward  10  miles 
to  where  the  south  branch  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault 
emerges  from  the  range  appears  to  constitute  a  single 
unit.  Although  the  faults  are  concealed  by  alluvium 
in  most  places  along  this  segment,  the  nearly  linear 
range  front  suggests  that  the  faults  are  nearly  straight, 
with  an  average  strike  of  about  north  60  degrees  west. 
Both  ends  of  the  segment  curve  inward  toward  the 
range. 

The  central  part  of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  system 
is  complicated  by  several  faults  which  curve  into  the 
range.  The  most  westerly  is  the  south  branch  of  the 
San  Gabriel  fault.  It  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the 
"Sierra  Madre  fault";  but,  as  previously  indicated,  it 
is  a  nearly  vertical  strike-slip  fault  which  shows  no 
evidence  of  recent  displacement.  .-Xbout  10  miles  fur- 
ther east,  the  frontal  faults  appear  to  curve  northeast- 
ward into  the  range  and  join  the  Sawpit  Canyon  fault. 
The  picture  is  further  complicated  by  the  Raymond 
Hill  fault  ^\•hich  joins  the  range  front  a  mile  south  of 
the  Sawpit  Canyon  fault  and  trends  west-southwest- 
ward  across  the  northwestern  San  Gabriel  Valle^^  It 
produces  a  very  prominent  scarp  in  alluvium  with 
the  north  side  up.  Further  east  along  the  range  front, 
faults  curve  northeastward  up  Big  Dalton  and  San 
Dimas  Canyons.  The  details  of  the  frontal  fault  sys- 
tem are  fairly  well  known  in  this  area  as  a  result  of 
investigations  by  the  Metropolitan  Water  District 
of  Southern  California  (Proctor,  Payne,  and  Kalin, 
1970). 

North  of  Pomona,  che  range  front  jogs  northeast- 
ward 4  miles  to  the  mouth  of  San  Antonio  Canyon. 
Although  the  frontal  fault  is  not  exposed  in  this  area, 
the  jog  is  in  alignment  with  a  branch  of  the  San  An- 
tonio fault  which  extends  north-northeastward  across 
the  interior  of  the  range. 

To  the  east  of  San  Antonio  Canyon,  the  frontal 
faults  extend  about  north  85  degrees  east  for  14  miles 
to  the  San  Jacinto  fault  at  the  east  end  of  the  range. 
This  segment  of  the  Sierra  iMadre  fault  system  appears 
to  move  as  a  unit  and  is  referred  to  as  the  Cucamonga 
fault  zone.  It  is  marked  by  young  fault  scarps  de- 
scribed by  Eckis  (1928). 


Much  more  must  be  learned  about  the  Sierra 
Aladre  fault  system  before  we  will  be  able  to  predict 
the  location  of  future  fault  displacements  and  thercb\' 
prevent  damage  such  as  occurred  during  the  San  Fer- 
nando earthquake.  Unfortunatel\-,  poor  exposures  limit 
the  amount  of  data  that  can  be  gathered  from  surface 
observations. 


AGE  AND  MECHANISM  OF  RANGE  UPLIFT 

How  long  have  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  ex- 
isted as  a  mountain  range?  One  might  answer  that 
part  of  the  range  dates  back  to  at  least  Oligocene. 
.Mountains  occupying  the  same  area  as  the  northwest- 
ern part  of  the  modern  range  shed  sediments  westward 
and  northward  into  the  Soledad  basin  almost  continu- 
ously from  Oligocene  to  present.  However,  the  pre- 
Pleistocene  physiography  was  quite  different  from  that 
of  today.  For  example.  Pliocene  marine  rocks  occur  in 
the  southwestern  part  of  the  range,  and  .Miocene  ma- 
rine rocks  occur  along  the  southwestern  and  south- 
central  range  margins.  Alluvial  deposits  of  Miocene 
and  Pliocene  age  exposed  along  the  northeastern 
margin  of  the  range  were  derived  from  the  Alojave 
Desert  region  to  the  north  and  northeast  and  show 
no  evidence  of  a  mountain  range  to  the  south. 
Also,  reconstruction  of  displacements  along  the  San 
Gabriel,  San  Jacinto,  and  San  Andreas  faults  indicate 
that  currently  adjacent  rocks  \\-ere  many  miles  apart 
in  mid-Cenozoic  time.  Thus  it  is  inappropriate  to 
correlate  precisely  pre-Pleistocene  mountains  with  the 
modern  range. 

x^s  best  as  can  be  determined,  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  proper  began  to  acquire  their  modern  con- 
figuration during  the  early  Pleistocene  but  did  not 
acquire  their  present  height  until  late  Pleistocene  and 
Holocene  time.  Uplift  of  the  eastern  half  of  the  range 
is  recorded  by  a  reversal  in  the  source  direction  of 
alluvial  deposits  along  the  northeastern  range  margin. 
Whereas  the  Miocene  and  Pliocene  deposits  came  from 
the  Mojave  Desert  and  contain  no  clast  t_\pes  charac- 
teristic of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountain  basement  terrane. 
Pleistocene  gravels  came  from  the  south  and  contain 
abundant  clasts  of  Lowe  Granodiorite,  Pelona  Schist, 
and  other  rock  types  characteristic  of  a  San  Gabriel 
Mountain  source.  Although  the  western  part  of  the 
range  north  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault  has  been  a  posi- 
tive area  since  at  least  the  Oligocene  epoch,  the  area 
south  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault  was  below  sea  level  as 
recently  as  the  Pliocene  and  was  the  site  of  thick  ac- 
cumulations of  alluvium  during  early  Pleistocene  time. 

There  are  remnants  of  a  subdued  erosion-surface 
and  alluvial  terrace  deposits  in  many  places,  particu- 
larl\'  near  the  range  margins  and  along  the  sides  of 
major  drainage  systems.  The\"  indicate  that  the  San 
Gabriel  iMountains  were  quite  low  in  mid-Pleistocene 
time,  with  broad  valleys  extending  into  the  interior  of 
the  range.  Late  Pleistocene  and  Holocene  uplift  has 
resulted  in  rapid  down-cutting  of  major  drainage 
channels  and  has  produced  steep-sided  \^-shaped  can- 
yons. Less  uplift  has  occurred  in  the  western  part  of 
the  range  than  the  eastern  part. 

Why  have  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  been  up-

lifted,  and  what  controls  their  size  and  shape?  The 
answer  cannot  he  obtained  from  the  rocks  exposed 
within  the  range.  Whereas  the  range's  internal  geolog\- 
is  very  complex  l)ccausc  of  multiple  stapes  of  nieta- 
morphism,  intrusion,  and  faulting,  range  uplift  has 
followed  a  relativel&gt;'  simple  pattern  of  reverse  faulting 
along  the  southern  margin  and  broad  arching  along 
the  northern  margin.  I'"urthcrmorc,  rather  than  being 
an  isolated  range,  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  are  part 
of  a  continuous  chain  of  mountains  within  the  Trans- 
verse Range  proxince  of  southern  California.  The  San 
Bernardino  Alountains  are  directl\-  east  of  them 
across  the  San  Andreas  fault.  The  r\vo  ranges  arc  sep- 
arated by  Cajon  Canyon  which  has  formed  by  erosion 
of  sheared  basement  rock  and  Tertiar\-  strata  along  and 
adjacent  to  the  San  Andreas  fault.  Pleistocene  alluvial 
deposits  form  bluffs  interconnecting  the  two  ranges 
north  of  Cajon  Canyon.  The  deposits  have  been  tilted 
northward  toward  the  Mojave  Desert  along  their  en- 
tire exposed  length  of  27  miles.  Redding  dips  10  to  25 
degrees  north  in  the  lower  part  of  the  deposits  and 
5  to  15  degrees  north  in  the  upper  part. 

The  Santa  Susana  Mountains  are  a  westward  ex- 
tension of  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains.  They  are  under- 
lain b\-  several  thousand  feet  of  Cenozoic  strata,  mostl\' 
of  marine  origin.  As  recentl\'  as  lower  Pliocene,  ocean 
depths  of  2000  to  3000  feet  arc  believed  to  have 
existed  in  the  central  part  of  the  range  (Winterer  and 
Durham,  1962,  p.  314).  Lower  Pleistocene  alluvial  de- 
posits \\  hich  are  folded  into  a  tight  syncline  along  the 
southern  margin  of  the  Santa  Susana  Mountains  con- 
tain clasts  of  schist  derived  from  Sierra  Pelona,  15 
miles  to  the  northeast  at  its  closest  point.  The  deposits 
contain  all  other  clast  types  found  in  the  Soledad 
Basin  and  adjacent  basement  terranc  north  of  the  San 
Gabriel   fault.   Apparently,  an  alluvial  slope  drained 


southward  across  the  Soledad  basin  and  Santa  Susana 
.Mountains  to  a  trough  along  the  northern  edge  of 
the  San  Fernando  \'^alley  in  lower  Pleistocene  time. 
Thus,  uplift  of  the  Santa  Susana  .Mountains  has  oc- 
curred during  the  late  Pleistocene  and  Holocenc. 
Unlike  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  uplift  was  accom- 
plished b\-  tight  folding  in  combination  with  thrust 
faulting;  however,  this  difference  in  st\le  of  deforma- 
tion is  due  to  the  presence  of  a  thick  sequence  of  thin- 
bedded  sedimentary  rocks. 

In  conclusion,  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  are  a 
segment  of  the  much  larger  Transverse  Ranges  prov- 
ince, and  their  uplift  is  apparcntK-  due  to  the  same 
causes  as  those  that  have  produced  the  Transverse 
Ranges.  The  Transverse  Ranges  form  a  roughly 
wedge-shaped  province  that  opens  westward  with  an 
apical  angle  of  about  15  degrees.  The  present  ranges 
have  been  formed  by  Pleistocene  and  Holocene  crustal 
shortening  along  a  north-south  axis.  It  is  commonly 
assumed  that  the  shortening  has  been  caused  b\-  redi- 
rection of  strike-slip  movement  along  the  bend  in  the 
San  Andreas  fault,  .\nother  possibility  is  that  sea-floor 
spreading  is  occurring  more  rapidly  in  the  southern 
part  of  the  Gulf  of  California  than  the  northern  part. 
This  would  result  in  a  clockwise  rotation  of  Baja 
California  and  southern  California  southward  from  the 
San  .\ndreas  fault  and  could  produce  the  Transverse 
Ranges  b\-  a  nutcracker-like  lever  action.  Whichever 
may  be  the  cause  of  the  crustal  shortening,  the  base- 
ment rocks  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  are  deform- 
ing as  a  competent,  semirigid  unit  with  brittle  rup- 
ture along  the  south  side  and  arching  on  the  north  side. 
The  San  Fernando  earthquake  provides  proof  that 
range  uplift  is  still  going  on  and  that  earthquakes  are 
likely  to  occur  along  other  segments  of  the  range  front 
within  the  foreseeable  future. 


CHAPTER  3 

Geology  of  the  Epkenfral  Area' 

by  Gordon  B.  Oakeshott  ^ 


The  pattern  of  principal  ground  rupturing,  land- 
sliding,  and  ground  shaking  in  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  and  its  aftershocks  consists  of  a  roughly 
triangular  area  about  20  km  on  a  side,  although  some 
landsliding  took  place  over  30  km  from  the  epicenter. 
The  epicenter  of  the  main  shock  is  about  the  apex  of 
this  triangle;  the  aftershock  pattern  approximates  the 
eastern  and  western  sides;  and  the  irregular,  discon- 
tinuous surface  ruptures  in  the  fault  zone  make  a  base 
to  the  triangle  about  15  km  long. 

The  fault  break  that  caused  the  earthquake  origi- 
nated at  a  hypocenter  about  8  km  deep  in  the  crystal- 
line rocks,  13  km  north-northeast  of  San  Fernando, 
and  progressed  upward  toward  the  south  at  an  average

rate  of  about  2  Yi  km  per  second  (Allen,  this  Bulletin; 
and  Bolt,  this  Bulletin).  Maximum  deformation  was 
elevation  of  the  mountain  block  about  2  m  and  shift 
of  that  block  westward  (left-lateral  slip)  by  2  m. 
The  San  Fernando  Valley  block,  south  of  the  fault 
trace,  showed  little  or  no  movement.  Amount  of 
crustal  shortening  along  a  N  20°  E  line  was  on  the 
order  of  2  m. 

The  complex  1971  San  Fernando  fault  trace  at 
the  foot  of  the  mountains  on  the  sloping  floor  of  the 
San  Fernando  Valley  is  irregular  and  discontinuous, 
and  the  strike  of  the  trace  changes  from  N  70°  W 
in  the  Lakeview-Tujunga  segment  through  due  W  in 
the  Sylmar  segment  to  SW  in  the  Santa  Susana  fault 
zone.  At  the  ground  surface,  dip  and  net  slip  of  the 
fault  vary  within  wide  limits  along  the  strike.  Seis- 
mological  data  show  that  the  initial  fault  rupture  at 
the  hypocenter  was  on  a  fault  surface  dipping  50°  N 
and  that  the  average  dip  of  the  fault  surface  was  about

associated  bedding-plane  fault  called  the  Oak  Hill  foult  (Kamb  ef  al.,  1971;  Proctor  et  al.,  1972).  The  visible  dip  of  the  fault  plane  is  north, 
parallel  to  the  dipping  thin  sandstone  beds  of  the  Modelo  outcrop  on  the   upthrown  side.   Height   of  the   fault  scarp   is  close  to  3   feet.

vision of  Mines  and  Geology  (Barrows,  Kahle,

these  attitudes  flatten  until  many  near-surface  fault 
dips  are  20°  or  less. 

THE  CRYSTALLINE  ROCKS 
The  "core"  (which  may  well  be  cut  off  by 
thrust  faulting  of  large  displacement  at  depth)  of  the 
western  San  Gabriel  Mountains  consists  of  coarse- 
grained crystalline  rocks  of  great  variety  which  range 
in  age  from  Precambrian  to  Late  Cretaceous.  The 
mountains  are  flanked  on  three  sides  by  sedimentary 
strata  derived  from  the  crystalline  rocks  and  repre- 
senting all  epochs  of  the  Tertiary  and  Quaternary 
periods. 

The  oldest  known  rock  unit  in  the  western  San 
Gabriel  Mountains  is  the  Precambrian  Mendenhall 
Gneiss,  a  retrograded,  charnockitic  granulite  of 
obscure  origin  whose  blue-quartz-feldspar  gneiss,  am- 
phibolite,  and  biotite-hornblende  gneiss  may  repre- 
sent rocks  of  sedimentary,  volcanic,  and  plutonic 
origin.  These  rocks  crop  out  over  9  square  miles  in  a 
belt  just  north  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault  and  are  shown 
in  the  geologic  map  (plate  1).  The  anorthosite- 
gabbro  group  of  rocks,  also  of  Precambrian  age,  which 
crops  out  over  80  square  miles  of  the  western  San 
Gabriel    Mountains,    has    intruded    the    Mendenhall 


Gneiss.  Radiometric  age  of  the  anorthosite  and  related 
rocks  is  1.22  billion  years;  lead-zinc  age  for  the  Men- 
denhall Gneiss  is  1.44  billion  years  (Silver,  et  al., 
1963).  Principal  rock  types  in  the  San  Gabriel  an- 
orthosite-gabbro  complex  are  andesine  anorthosite, 
gabbroic  anorthosite,  anorthositic  gabbro,  metagabbro, 
metanorite,  diorite  and  metadiorite,  metapyroxenite, 
titanomagnetite  rocks,  a  minor  amount  of  olivine  gab- 
bro, hornblende  norite,  hornblende  gabbro,  and  small 
bodies  of  gabbro  pegmatite.  These  rocks  are  all  facies 
of  the  anorthosite-gabbro  group  of  nearly  the  same 
age.  Certain  facies  overlapped  in  time  of  formation, 
and  contacts  may  be  sharp  or  gradational. 

The  outcrop  of  the  anorthosite  body  is  oval  in 
plan,  the  long  axis  trending  N  70°  W  for  19  miles 
north  of  and  parallel  to  the  San  Gabriel  fault;  the 
body's  depth  and  what  underlies  it  are  unknown.  In- 
ternal structural  features,  including  bordering  platy 
flow  banding,  discontinuous  fractures  and  granulation, 
mafic  tabular  bodies,  block  structure,  and  micro-shat- 
tering of  pyroxene  and  plagioclase  crystals,  are 
features  which  developed  in  the  body  of  gabbroic- 
anorthosite  magma  while  it  crystallized  slowly,  under 
pressure,  from  its  outer  to  its  inner  portions.  Contacts 
of  the  anorthosite  group  \vith  the  older  gneisses  are 
essentially  concordant,  but  local  discordant  relation- 
ships with  Mendenhall  Gneiss  occur. 

If  the  depth  of  hypocenter  of  the  main  shock  of 
February  9  was  truly  about  8  km,  then  the  initial  fault

break  probably  took  place  in  the  Precambrian  rocks. 

Three  major  groups  of  rocks  of  uncertain  age 
probably  represent  parts  of  the  ver\-  long  period  of 
time  from  Late  Precambrian  to  Late  Cretaceous. 
They  are  the  Pelona  Schist,  Placerita  Formation  and 
the  "diorite  gneiss"  (Geologic  column,  figure  2).  The 
mica-chlorite-albite  schist,  actinolite-albite  schist, 
quartz-biotite  schist,  quartzite,  and  acrinolite-talc 
schist  of  the  Pelona  are  regionally  metamorphosed 
fine-grained  sedimentary  and  volcanic  rocks  which  do 
not  appear  in  the  cpicentral  area  proper  (See  Ehlig, 
this  Bulletin)  but  appear  in  a  large  block  a  few  miles 
north  of  the  epicenter. 

The  Placerita  Formation  consists  of  metamor- 
phosed sedimentary  rocks  that  appear  as  roof  pend- 
ants in  Late  Cretaceous  granitic  rocks,  south  of  the 
San  Gabriel  fault.  Rock  types  include  crystalline  lime- 
stone and  dolomite,  graphitic  schists,  and  feldspathic 
gneiss  that  closely  resemble  the  Mississippian  Furnace 
limestone  and  mctasedimentary  rocks  of  the  San  Ber- 
nardino Mountains  in  many  respects;  their  correlation 
is  suggested.  The  Placerita  metasedimentary  rocks 
are  intimately  associated  with  dark  dioritic  gneiss,  mig- 
matites,  and  biotitc  schist  mapped  collectively  as 
"diorite  gneiss".  The  latter  may  well  correlate  with 


the  border  facies  of  the  Lowe  Granodiorite  (Ehlig, 
this  Bulletin),  age  220  ±  10  million  years  (Permian- 
Triassic). 

Granodiorite,  quartz  monzonite,  granite,  and 
other  granitic  rocks  exposed  in  about  30  square  miles 
of  the  epicentral  area  probably  correlate  wth  similar 
plutonic  rocks  in  the  Transverse  and  Peninsular 
Ranges,  the  Mojave  Desert,  and  southern  Sierra  Ne- 
vada, w  hich  arc  of  Late  Cretaceous  atje.  A  few  radio- 
metric dates  on  the  order  of  70  million  years  in  the 
San  Gabriel  Mountains  have  been  obtained.  It  is  prob- 
able that  an  ancestral  San  Gabriel  Mountain  range 
was  built  in  Cretaceous  time.  This  range  was  eroded 
to  a  low  level  by  the  close  of  the  Cretaceous  and 
Paleocene  seas  transgressed  the  site. 

THE  SEDIMENTARY  ROCK  FORMATIONS 

The  topographic  and  structural  high  of  the  Ceno- 
zoic  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  probably  in  existence 
continuously  during  post-Paleocene  time,  furnished 
sediments  to  form  the  many  thousands  of  feet  of 
Cenozoic  marine  and  continental  sedimentary  forma- 
tions, with  intercalated  volcanic  rocks,  which  flank 
the  western  end  of  the  mountains  on  three  sides.  The 
San  Gabriel  fault  divides  the  eastern  Ventura  basin

into  two  local  provinces  of  quite  different  geologic 
history:  the  Soledad  basin  northeast  of  the  fault  and 
the  San  Fernando  basin  south  of  the  fault. 

In  the  Soledad  basin,  late  Eocene  to  late  Miocene 
time  is  represented  by  an  aggregate  thickness  of  nearly 
14,000  feet  of  nonmarine  fluviatile  and  lacustrine  sedi- 
ments and  interbedded  volcanic  rocks  comprising  the 
Vasquez,  Tick  Canyon,  and  Mint  Canyon  formations. 
The  three  formations  have  unconformable  relation- 
ships, and  none  has  been  recognized  southwest  of  the 
fault.  The  Modelo  Formation  of  the  Mohnian-Del- 
montian  foraminiferal  stages  unconformably  overlies 
the  Mint  Canvon  Formation. 


In  the  San  Fernando  basin,  middle  Eocene  marine 
beds  of  the  Domengine  Formation  crop  out  in  Els- 
mere  Canyon,  and  wells  in  the  area  have  penetrated 
marine  beds  of  the  Meganos,  Capay,  and  Domengine 
stages  of  late  Paleocene  to  middle  Eocene  age.  The 
middle  Miocene  nonmarine  sandstone,  conglomerate, 
and  volcanic  flows  of  the  Topanga(?)  Formation  un- 
derlie at  least  3000  feet  of  marine  beds  of  the  Modelo 
Formation  of  the  Luisian  and  Mohnian  stages  of  mid- 
dle and  upper  Miocene.  The  marine  Paleocene  "Mar- 
tinez" Formation  crops  out  onlv  as  slivers  in  the  San 
Gabriel  fault  zone.  Thus,  the  Soledad  and  San  Fer- 
nando basins  were  probably  first  developed  in  late

Eocene  time  as  the  western  San  Gabriel  Mountains 
rose.  Paleocene  seas  were  the  last  to  cross  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountain  area. 

Pliocene  time  is  represented  by  marine  rocks  of 
the  lower  Pliocene  Repetto  Formation  and  middle  and 
upper  Pliocene  Pico  Formation,  south  of  the  San 
Gabriel  fault.  The  marine  Pliocene  has  a  maximum 
thickness  of  about  4000  feet  in  San  Fernando  basin, 
in  contrast  to  not  more  than  200  feet  in  Soledad  basin. 
The  nonmarine  and  brackish-water  upper  Pliocene 
Sunshine  Ranch  Member  of  the  Pico  Formation  has  a 
thickness  of  3000  feet  at  Van  Norman  Reservoir  and 
a  maximum  thickness  of  1300  feet  in  Soledad  basin. 


The  term  "Towsley  Formation"  (Winterer  and  Dur- 
ham, 1962)  used  in  some  papers  in  this  Bulletin  may 
include  some  late  A'liocene  and  early  Pliocene  units 
as  used  in  this  paper. 

The  continental  lower  Pleistocene  Saugus  For- 
mation is  widely  distributed  both  north  and  south  of 
San  Gabriel  fault;  maximum  thickness  is  6400  feet  in 
San  Fernando  basin  but  only  650  feet  in  Soledad 
basin.  Reddish  fanglomerate  of  the  middle  (?)  Pleisto-

STRUCTURAL  PROVINCES  AND  HISTORY 
Cenozoic  structural  history  of  San  Fernando  area 
involves  three  geologic  provinces:  the  western  end  of 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountain  block  of  pre-Tertiary  crys- 
talline rocks,  the  Soledad  basin  of  nonmarine  Tertiary- 
Quaternary  sedimentary  rocks  at  the  northeastern  end 
of  the  Ventura  basin,  and  the  San  Fernando  basin  of 
marine  Tertiary-nonmarine  Quaternary  sedimentary 
rocks  at  the  southeastern  end  of  the  Ventura  basin, 
marginal  to  the  Los  Angeles  basin.  The  Cenozoic  rec- 
ord shows  that  intermittent,  frequent  uplift  of  the 
San  Gabriel  mountain  block  has  taken  place,  acceler- 
ated at  times,  with  faulting,  folding,  and  readjustments 
around  the  margins  of  that  competent  crystalline 
block.  Major  northwest-trending  and  northeast-trend- 
ing faults  slice  across  crystalline-rock  and  sedimen- 
tary provinces  and  obliquely  across  the  prevailing 
east-west  trend  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  A  major 
zone  of  reverse  faults  separates  the  crystalline  block 
from  flanking  Cenozoic  stratified  rocks  along  the 
south  side  of  the  range,  but  some  of  the  individual 
faults  in  this  zone  are  within  the  sedimentary  units 
or  within  the  crystalline-rock  units. 

Structure  of  the  area  is  dominated  by  the  San 
Gabriel  fault,  which  extends  obliquely  across  the  west- 
ern San  Gabriel  Mountains.  The  pattern  of  faulting 


consists  of;  1 )  a  principal  series  of  north-dipping  shear 
planes  along  the  San  Gabriel  fault  zone  trending  N 
65°  W  and  showing  right-lateral  movement;  2)  in 
the  north  block,  a  series  of  complementary  left-lateral 
faults  trending  predominently  N  65°  E;  and  3)  in 
the  south  block,  the  series  of  north-dipping  reverse 
faults  of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone. 

Right-lateral  strike-slip  movement  on  the  San 
Gabriel  fault  has  probably  been  on  the  order  of  4 
luiles  in  Quaternary  time,  judging  by  displacement 
of  older  faults  and  sediments  that  lie  on  the  crystalline 
rocks.  Profound  differences  in  rock  types  and  in  geo- 
logic history  of  the  terrane  north  of  the  San  Gabriel 
fault  and  that  to  the  south  indicate  the  importance 
of  that  fault  zone.  The  Placerita  fault  is  a  major  local 
branch  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault.  A  sliver  of  late  Plio- 
cene beds  of  the  Pico  Formation  some  1300  feet  wide 
represents  a  synclinal  downdropped  block  within  the 
San  Gabriel  fault  zone.  This  would  require  an  appar- 
ent 1000-foot  post-Saugus  (post-early  Pleistocene) 
component  of  displacement  on  the  Placerita  fault,  in 
which  relative  movement  was  down  on  the  north 
side.  On  the  south  plane  of  the  San  Gabriel  fault 
nearby,  there  is  an  apparent  vertical  component  of 
displacement  of  700  feet  up  on  the  north  side.  At 
Sierra  Highway,  the  most  reasonable  section  that  can 
be  drawn  shows  the  north  block  of  the  San  Gabriel 
fault  to  have  been  raised  a  minimum  of  1500  feet  in 
post-Pacoima  (mid-Pleistocene)  time.  Initial  move- 
ments in  the  San  Gabriel  fault  zone  may  have  taken 
place  as  early  as  the  time   of  the  Late   Cretaceous

orogcn\-,  but  there  is  no  positive  evidence  to  indicate 
movement  on  this  fault  in  latest  Quaternary  time. 
Subsequent  fault  activity  ma&gt;'  well  have  transferred 
to  the  San  Andreas  fault  about  20  miles  to  the  north- 
east 

The  principal  faults  north  of  the  San  Gabriel 
fault  zone  are  northeast-trending  and  have  a  large 
component  of  left-lateral  horizontal  displacement  and 
a  significant  vertical  component.  They  range  in  time 
of  latest  movement  from  pre-Miocene  to  Late  Qua- 
ternary. The  Soledad  fault  is  a  normal  dip-slip  fault 
that  parallels  Soledad  Canyon  and  separates  the  Ter- 
tiary Mint  Canyon  and  Vasquez  formations  of  the 
Soledad  basin  from  Precambrian  anorthosite  of  the 
San  Gabriel  massif.  It  has  probably  defined  this  margin 
of  the  basin  since  late  Eocene  or  early  Oligocene  time. 

The  dominant  fold-structure  of  the  southern  sedi- 
mentary area,  or  San  Fernando  basin,  is  the  asym- 
metrical Little  Tujunga  syncline,  which  changes  its 
west-to-east  trend  from  N  60°  E  parallel  to  the  Santa 
Susana  fault  zone  through  due  E  and  S  70°  E  paral- 
lel to  the  faulting  of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone. 
North  limb  of  the  syncline  is  very  steep  to  over- 
turned and  is  partly  cut  out  by  the  Sierra  Madre  faults. 

Unconformities  between  the  successive  Cenozoic 
formations  in  San  Fernando  area  show  that  otogenic 
movements  took  place  locally  at  various  times,  but 
the  mid-Pleistocene  otogenic  epoch  overshadowed  all 
the  others  in  intensity.  During  the  faulting  and  ac- 
companying folding,  the  massif  of  pre-Tertiary  crys- 
talline rocks  behaved  essentially  as  a  competent  block 
undergoing  intermittent  elevation,  with  adjustments 
within  that  block  accomplished  by  faulting,  shearing, 
and  fracturing. 

THE  SIERRA  MADRE  FAULT  ZONE 
The  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone  is  a  series  of  arcuate 
convex-southward  reverse  faults  which  generally 
separate  the  pre-Tertiary  crystalline  rocks  on  the  north 
from  Cenozoic  sedimentary  formations  on  the  south. 
The  faults  are  discontinuous  and  of  variable  dip  from 


15°  to  near-vertical;  all  dip  northward,  with  the  crys- 
talline rocks  thrust  upward  toward  the  south  over 
Quaternary  sediments  and  the  mid-Pleistocene  Pacoima 
Formation;  some,  of  course,  are  post-alluvium.  Dis- 
placements have  been  essentially  of  the  dip-slip  type 
and  are  as  great  as  600  m  on  any  one  fault.  The  fault 
zone  (figure  3)  is  comprised  of  the  following  discon- 
tinuous faults,  from  west  to  east:  the  Grapevine,  Som- 
brero, Hospital,  Buck  Canyon-Watt,  an  unnamed  fault 
in  upper  Kagel  Canyon,  Lopez,  Sunland,  and  Rowley 
faults,  and  probably  continues  eastward  along  the  en- 
tire front  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  "Sierra 
Madre"  came  from  an  old  name  for  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains,  not  from  the  town  of  Sierra  Madre.  East- 
ward, the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone  appears  to  cut  across 
the  right-lateral  southeast-trending  San  Gabriel  fault 
and  continue  as  the  frontal  fault  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  north  of  the  town  of  Sierra  Madre.  The 
San  Fernando  fault  of  February  9,  1971,  must  cut  the 
San  Gabriel  fault  at  depth,  as  seen  in  geologic  section 
(figure  4). 

The  Grapevine  and  Sombrero  faults,  and  subsidi- 
ary lesser  faults,  represent  continuing  faults  in  the 
northeast  end  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust-fault  zone. 
The  Grapevine  fault  is  exposed  on  a  very  steep,  high, 
topographic  slope  where  the  Placerita  Formation- 
diorite-gneiss  complex  has  been  thrust,  at  angles  of 
40°  to  50°,  or  steeper,  over  folded  and  disturbed  beds 
of  the  early  Pliocene  Elsmere  Member  of  the  Repetto 
Formation.  The  north-trending  Sombrero  fault  shows 
the  same  relationships  but  has  a  near-vertical  dip  in 
Sombrero  Canyon.  Hill  1876  is  an  interesting  khppe 
of  the  crystalline-rock  complex  lying  on  the  lower 
Pliocene  Elsmere  Member.  Careful  inspection  leaves 
this  feature  open  to  various  interpretations,  but  it 
seems  most  likely  that  the  klippe  represents  a  mid- 
Pleistocene  subsidiary  gravity  fault  along  the  front  of 
an  active  Grapevine  fault. 

The  Hospital  fault  strikes  due  east  for  2  miles 
along  the  steep  mountain  front  from  Olive  X'^icw  Sana-

torium  to  the  Veterans  Administration  Hospital.  The 
fault  dips  from  45°  to  60°  N  and  has  thrust  crystalline 
rocks  over  the  strongly  folded  fanglomerate  of  the 
mid-Pleistocene  Pacoima  Formation;  the  fault  does  not 
appear  to  have  displaced  Late  Quaternary  terrace  grav- 
els, but  this  remains  uncertain.  It  can  be  approximately 
traced  throughout  most  of  its  course,  but  the  precise 
contact  is  usually  obscure.  Apparent  dip  of  this  fault, 
as  well  as  that  of  the  east-west  portion  of  the  Grape- 
vine fault,  may  have  been  lowered  by  slumping  on  the 
steep  slope;  dip  at  depth  is  probably  steeper.  Barrows 
(this  Bulletin)  does  not  consider  the  Hospital  fault  to 
be  important  and  does  not  consider  that  it  extends  west 
of  Loop  Canyon;  however,  it  appears  to  cut  out  the 
north  limb  of  the  Little  Tujunga  syncline  (Oakeshott, 
1958);  and  immediately  south  of  the  fault,  in  the  axis 
of  the  western  prolongation  of  the  Little  Tujunga 
s\Ticline,  crystalline  basement  lies  at  a  depth  of  more 
than  12,000  feet  in  Sunray  Oil  Company  Stetson-Som- 
brero I  (Oakeshott,  1958).  Thus,  the  total  of  down- 
folding  and  throw  on  the  Hospital  fault  must  be  on 
the  order  of  4  km  (lYz  miles).  This  could  be  attrib- 
uted predominantly  to  folding,  rather  than  faulting; 
Barrows  certainly  mapped  on  a  much  larger  scale  and 
spent  much  more  time  on  the  area  than  I  did. 

The  Buck  Canyon-Watt  fault  marks  the  north- 
west and  northern  limit  of  the  Saugus  Formation  in  the 
Little  Tujunga  area.  The  Buck  Canyon  fault  strikes 
generally  N  75°  to  85°  E  and  continues  toward  the 
east  as  the  Watt  fault.  The  plane  of  the  Buck  Canyon- 
Watt  fault  dips  generally  northward;  but  the  dip  is 
variable,  usually  bet^\•een  45°  and  75°.  Cretaceous 
granodiorite  has  been  thrust  over  the  Saugus  Forma- 
tion along  the  Buck  Canyon  section  of  the  fault;  along 
most  of  the  length  of  the  Watt  fault,  the  upthrown 
side  consists  of  the  Paleocene  "Martinez"  Formation 
caught  between  that  fault  and  the  DeAlille  branch  of 
the  San  Gabriel  fault.  At  the  head  of  Lopez  Canyon, 
the  loop  and  anomalous  reversed  dip  in  the  Buck  Can- 
yon fault  are  probably  Late  Quaternary  landslide  ef- 
fects. Saugus  strata  steepen  rapidly  from  south  to 
north,  approaching  the  Watt  fault,  until  at  the  contact 
attitudes  of  bedding  equal  those  of  the  fault  plane. 
Martinez  beds  on  the  upthrown  side  are  contorted  and 
fractured.  Throw  is  at  least  600  m  as  inferred  from  the 
fact  that  the  base  of  the  Saugus  Formation  along  Gold 
Creek  if  projected  northward,  downdip,  would  inter- 
sect the  fault  plane  at  least  600  m  below  the  surface; 
Saugus  beds  do  not  appear  north  of  the  fault.  Displace- 
ment on  the  fault  lessens  toward  the  west;  in  upper 
Buck  Canyon  an  estimate  of  300  m  of  vertical  displace- 
ment can  be  made.  The  fault  steepens  and  dies 
out  in  granitic  rocks  in  Limekiln  Canyon.  At  the 
eastern  end  of  the  Buck  Canyon-Watt  fault  its  several 
elements  strike  into  the  San  Gabriel  fault  zone. 

From  upper  Kagel  Canyon  to  Buck  Canyon  a 
northeast-trending  reverse  fault  dipping  25°  NW  has 
thrust  the  crystalline  rocks  over  Saugus  strata.  The 
fault  has  a  throw  of  60  to  200  m.  At  its  southwest  end, 
trend  of  this  fault  swings  about  to  parallel  the  Lopez 
fault,  and  may  merge  with  it. 

The  Lopez  fault  strikes  generally  N  70°  W  as  it 
crosses  Kagel  and  Lopez  Canyons.  It  continues  east- 


\\ard  to  within  500  m  of  Little  Tujunga  Canvon  where 
its  strike  changes  abruptly  to  N  35°  F.  Where  the 
strike  is  westerly,  dip  of  the  fault  is  from  50°  to  75° 
N;  at  the  type  locality  in  Lopez  Canyon  it  is  50°  N. 
An  overturned  anticline  with  due  east  strike  at  Lopez 
Canyon  strikes  acutely  into  the  fault  and  plunges  25° 
W.  This  minor  fold  on  the  south  side  of  the  fault  and 
the  swing  in  strike  of  the  fault  in  Kagel  Canyon  in  the 
north  block  suggest  a  possible  small  right-lateral  com- 
ponent of  displacement  in  this  part  of  the  Lopez  fault. 
Just  east  of  upper  Kagel  Canyon  is  the  small  De  Oro 
branch  fault  (Hill,  1930)  with  a  well-exposed  plane 
dipping  5°  N  which  is  cut  off  by  another  dipping  60° 
N.  The  block  of  granitic  rock  here  lying  on  a  5° 
slope,  like  the  Sombrero  klippe,  probably  represents 
post-Saugus  gravity  slumping  along  the  steep  scarp  of 
a  reverse  fault.  Displacement  along  the  Lopez  fault 
dies  out  to  the  north  in  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  and  at 
the  west  end  in  Pacoima  Canyon.  Alaximum  vertical 
displacement  may  be  estimated  near  the  major  bend  of 
the  fault,  using  the  base  of  the  Saugus  Formation  as 
the  reference  plane;  this  gives  a  figure  of  about  250  m. 

The  Sunland  fault  is  another  element  of  the  Sierra 
Madre  fault  zone  which  is  complicated  by  several  sub- 
sidiary faults,  although  it  is  essentially  a  reverse  fault 
with  granodiorite  thrust  over  sedimentary  rocks  as 
young  as  the  Saugus  Formation.  Slivers  of  middle(?) 
iMiocene  Topanga  volcanic  rocks  and  the  upper  Mio- 
cene Modelo  Formation  lie  between  branches  of  this 
fault.  Strike  of  the  Sunland  fault  varies  from  N  65° 
W  in  its  western  part  to  N  25°  E  near  its  eastern  end 
where  the  fault  dies  out  in  granitic  rocks  in  Tujunga 
Canyon.  Exposures  of  the  north  plane  show  near-ver- 
tical dips  but  mapping  of  the  Sunland  fault  proper 
shows  north  dips  of  about  50°  at  the  type  locality 
just  west  of  Ebey  Canyon.  Saugus  and  Alodelo  strata 
steepen  and  are  overturned  at  the  fault.  Perfectly  ex- 
posed Saugus  beds  lying  unconformably  on  gneiss  in 
Little  Tujunga  Road  and  similar  contacts  600  m 
farther  southeast  preclude  the  extension  of  the  fault 
northwestward  beyond  Herreres  Ranch.  An  explora- 
tory well,  Intex  Cleeves  2  (Oakeshott,  1958),  in  Cot- 
tonwood Glen  passed  through  the  Saugus  Formation 
at  a  depth  of  1,505  feet,  indicating  the  absence  of  any 
significant  fault.  Thus  the  Sunland  fault  dies  out  under 
a  rock  slide  near  Herreres  Ranch.  Maximum  vertical 
displacement  on  this  fault  must  be  quite  large,  possibly 
600  to  1,200  m. 

The  Rowley  fault  is  the  most  easterly  group  of 
faults  in  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone  discussed  here. 
In  the  town  of  Tujunga,  the  most  easterly  of  three 
fault  planes  is  a  15  m-wide  zone  of  brecciated  grano- 
diorite with  a  N  25°  W  strike  and  a  vertical  dip. 
The  main  Rowley  fault  plane,  next  west,  is  not  per- 
fectly exposed;  its  dip  is  obviously  east  and  granodio- 
rite is  thrust  over  very  coarse  east-dipping  conglomer- 
ate of  the  lower  Pliocene  Repetto  Formation.  The 
latter  is  faulted  against  west-dipping  basalt  flows  of 
the  middle  (?)  Miocene  Topanga  Formation. 

Mission  Hills  Faults 

A  fault  zone,  comprising  three  faults,  is  perfectly 
exposed  in  Sepulveda  Boulevard  road  cuts  at  the  south- 
eastern margin  of  Van  Norman  Reser\'oir  in  the  Mis-

sion  Hills.  Most  southerly  of  these  fault  planes  is  a 
reverse  fault  that  dips  60°  S  and  thrusts  rocks  of  the 
Modcio  Formation  on  the  north  limb  of  the  Mission 
Hills  anticline  over  the  lower  Pliocene  Repeto  Forma- 
tion. The  next  fault  north  dips  55°  S  and  has  thrust 
Repetto  sandstone  over  fossiliferous  sandstone  of  the 
middle  Pliocene  Lower  Pico  Member  of  the  Pico  For- 
mation. The  most  northerly  of  the  group  is  a  normal 
fault  dipping  75°  N,  which  has  dropped  upper  Plio- 
cene Sunshine  Ranch  beds  against  Lower  Pico. 

A  north-dipping  Mission  Hills  thrust  was  postu- 
lated, supported  by  the  anomalous  geologic  section 
reported  in  Universal  Consolidated  well  Panorama  1 
(Oakeshott,  1958).  It  was  argued  that,  if  such  a  fault 
exists,  it  might  be  expected,  by  analogy,  to  have  fea- 
tures similar  to  faults  of  the  Santa  Susana-Sierra  Madre 
zone.  That  is,  its  trace  should  be  convex  southward, 
its  trend  should  turn  to  northerly  around  the  eastern 
end  of  Mission  Hills,  it  should  dip  about  40°  to  50°  N, 
and  it  should  die  out  within  a  mile  or  two,  both  east 
and  west.  The  southwestern  end  of  the  1971  San  Fer- 
nando fault  may  well  be  part  of  the  Mission  Hills 
thrust. 

Pacoima  Hills  Fault 

A  well-exposed  east-trending  normal  (?)  fault, 
dipping  50°  N,  in  the  Pacoima  Hills  has  brought 
granodiorite  up  on  the  south  side  against  sedimentary 
and  volcanic  rocks  of  the  Topanga  Formation.  Four 
miles  east,  in  the  Verdugo  Hills,  these  formations  are 
in  unconformable  contact.  Viewing  the  Pacoima  Hills 
as  a  \vesrvvard  outlier  of  the  Verdugo  Hills  structural 
high,  this  fault  may  be  of  small  displacement.  Bailey 
and  Jahns  (1954)  projected  it  5  miles  east  as  a  buried 
fault  along  the  south  side  of  Tujunga  Valley.  How- 
ever, the  most  reasonable  structural  section  appears  to 
show  no  necessity  for  a  Tujunga  Valley  fault  with 
large  throw. 

The  San  Fernando  Fault,  1971 

The  fault  which  caused  the  earthquake  of  Febru- 
ary 9,  1971,  is  thoroughly  discussed  in  this  Bulletin  by 
many  authors.  Allen  and  Bolt,  for  example,  each  dis- 
cuss its  characteristics  from  the  seismic  records;  Kahle, 
Barrows  et  al.  have  mapped  it  and  recorded  its  geo- 
logical characteristics  in  great  detail  (plate  2).  I  wish 
only  to  call  attention  here  to  a  few  of  the  pertinent 
features  of  this  active  fault  in  the  context  of  its  place 
in  the  Sierra  Aiadre  fault  zone. 

1)   Hypocenter    of    the     earthquake    was  north     of    the 

San    Gabriel    foult    ot    a    depth    of    about    8  km    in    brittle, 

cryitalline   gabbroic   rocks   and/or  gneisses   of  relatively   high 
density   and   high   seismic-wave   velocities; 


2)  The  initiol  rupture,  on  a  fault  surface  dipping  about 
50**  N,  progressed  upward  and  southward  through  perhaps 
five  formations  of  decreasing  density  (Precambrion  gobbro 
or  gneiss.  Cretaceous  granodiorite.  Tertiary  volconics,  Ter- 
tiary morine  sediments,  and  Quaternary  sediments.  Near- 
surface  Quaternary  gravels  (including  Sougus,  the  oldest) 
extend  to  depths  of  ai  much  as  4  km  in  the  area.  The 
fault  must  have  cut  and  displaced  the  Son  Gabriel  and 
Hospital  fault  surfoces  (See  Geologic  Structure  Section,  figure 
3).  Near-surface  dip  of  the  Son  Fernando  fault  surface  was 
20     or  less;  overage  dip  was  about  35°. 

3)  Detailed,  large-scale  mapping  and  measurement  of 
any  attitudes  of  the  foult  surface  in  outcrop  have  demon- 
strated highly  irregular  and  variable  attitudes  but  pre- 
dominantly low  dips; 

4)  The  Lakeview-Tujunga  segment  of  the  fault  ttrikei  N 
70°  W;  the  Sylmor  segment  strikes  due  W;  and  the  Santa 
Susano  segment  strikes  SW — thus,  the  fault  surface  is  a  com- 
plex, warped  surface.  The  discontinuity  in  the  trace  at  its 
right-angle  turn  in  lower  Pacoima  Canyon  suggests  a  tear  or 
break  in  the  fault  surface  there  (Sharp,  this  Bulletin). 

5)  The  surface  of  crystalline  bedrock  below  the  Tertiary* 
Quaternary  sediments  of  the  Son  Fernando  basin  is  extremely 
steep  and  has  high  relief  (Oakeshott,  1958);  for  example,  the 
crystalline  rock  surface  exposed  in  the  Verdugo  Mountalns- 
Pocoimo  Hills  plunges  westward  over  400  m  per  km. 

Even  the  short  review  of  structural  history  in 
this  paper  shows  that,  geologically,  February  9,  1971, 
was  merely  the  latest  repetition  of  a  pattern  which  was 
established  in  mid-Pleistocene  time  at  least  a  million 
years  ago. 

Relationship  of  Damage  to  Geology 

Steinbrugge  and  others,  writing  in  this  Bulletin, 
have  noted  the  concentration  of  building  damage  a) 
along  the  fault  trace,  and  b)  in  a  second  belt  closer 
and  parallel  to  the  mountain  front  in  the  Sylmar  seg- 
ment of  the  fault.  Of  course,  reasons  for  damage  to 
buildings  in  the  fault  trace  are  obvious.  Furthermore, 
the  width  of  ground  rupture  and  zone  of  fault-trace 
damage  are  relatively  great  because  of  the  low  dip 
of  the  fault.  Damage  tends  to  be  concentrated  in  the 
upper  plate,  partly  because  it  is  thin  and  vulnerable 
to  failure  and  partly — in  this  case — because  the  upper 
plate  did  the  active  moving. 

Reasons  for  concentrated  damage  in  the  belt 
along  the  mountain  front  are  less  obvious,  but  this 
damage  zone  coincides  with  the  axis  of  the  Little 
Tujunga  syncline  where  the  loosely  consolidated 
Quaternary  sediments  reach  extraordinarily  great 
depths. 

The  "topographic"  effect  of  the  high-relief  sur- 
face of  crystalline  bedrock  which  underlies  the 
Quaternary  and  Tertiary  sediments  of  the  basin  gives 
opportunity  for  complexities  of  near-surface  earth- 
quake waves  and  ground  response.  Here  is  a  fertile 
model  for  study. 


CHAPTER  4 

Ground  Water  Geology 
of  the  San  Fernando  Valley^ 


by  Glenn  A.  Brown  ' 


The  author  of  this  paper  intends  to  set  forth  the 
hydrogeoiogic  framework  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley 
as  it  was  developed  prior  to  the  February  9,  1971, 
earthquake  and  to  appraise  the  effect  of  that  earth- 
quake on  ground  water  conditions  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  city  of  San  Fernando. 

Most  of  the  hydrogeoiogic  information  in  this 
paper  was  prepared  by  the  author  for  the  State  Water 
Rights  Board,  which  was  appointed  Referee  in  1958  in 
the  case  City  of  Los  Angeles  I'y.  City  of  Snn  Fernando 
et  al.  The  histor&gt;'  of  litigation  over  water  in  the  Upper 
Los  Angeles  River  Drainage  Basin  assists  greatly  in 
the  understanding  of  the  recharge,  occurrence,  and 
movement  of  ground  water  in  San  Fernando  \^alley. 
A  brief  history  of  litigation  is  included  in  this  paper. 

The  total  ground  water  storage  capacity  of  the  San 
Fernando  \'alley  has  been  estimated  to  be  in  excess  of 
3,500,000  acre-feet.  A  more  precise  estimate  is  not  ob- 
tainable due  to  the  unknown  depth  of  the  water-bear- 
ing deposits  in  the  east-central  parts  of  the  valley. 
Studies  of  the  change  in  storage  utilizing  the  specific 
yield  method  indicated  that  about  600,000  acre-feet 
had  been  removed  from  storage  from  the  historic 
high-water  levels  in  1944  to  the  lowered  water  levels 
in  1957. 

Several  hydrologic  "subareas"  were  established  for 
use  in  the  Report  of  Referee.  These  were  the  San 
Fernando  hydrologic  subarea,  the  Sylmar  hydrologic 
subarea,  the  V'erdugo  hydrologic  subarea,  and  the 
Eagle  Rock  hydrologic  subarea.  The  subareas  were 
established  for  purposes  of  description  and  data  tab- 
ulation. The  subareas  are  separated  from  each  other 
by  faults,  folds,  alluvial  constrictions,  or  man-made 
works.  The  San  Fernando  subarea  is  subjacent  to  each 
of  the  other  subareas  and  receives  surface  drainage 
from  all  of  them.  The  Sylmar,  \'erdugo,  and  Eagle 
Rock  subareas  are  not  directl\'  interrelated  or  interde- 
pendent upon  one  another. 

Brief  History  of  Litigation 

Litigation  over  water  has  been  one  of  the  primar\' 
motivations  to  seek  a  better  understanding  of  the  ori- 
gin, occurrence,  and  movement  of  ground  water 
within  the  San  Fernando  \'allcy  (Upper  Los  Angeles 
River  Drainage  Basin).  The  history  of  A\ater  rights  in 
California  is  one  of  numerous  judicial  decisions  as  a 
result  of  litigation  between  \\ater  users  in  the  water-

shed  of  the  upper  Los  Angeles  River.  This  brief  his- 
tory is  included  to  provide  an  understanding  of  the 
legal  problem  and  how  geologic  studies  have  been 
used. 

The  Pueblo  of  Los  Angeles  w  as  founded  by  land- 
grant  proclamation  in  1781.  The  proclamation  gave 
title  to  an  area  of  approximately  28  square  miles  and 
the  rights  to  take  the  waters  of  the  Los  Angeles  River 
for  municipal  use. 

The  first  known  test  of  the  grant  was  in  1810, 
when  certain  citizens  of  Los  Angeles  reported  to  the 
Spanish  Military  Commander  at  Santa  Barbara  that  the 
Fathers  of  Mission  San  Fernando  had  built  a  dam 
diverting  water  that  supplied  the  Pueblo.  The  commit- 
tee appointed  to  investigate  reported  that  the  dam 
\\  as  causing  suffering  and  damage.  The  Mission  Fathers 
finally  acknowledged  the  superior  rights  of  the 
Pueblo.  They  did  ask,  however,  for  permission  to  use 
sufficient  water  for  irrigating  land  necessary  to  the 
/Mission.  This  ^\•as  granted  with  the  definite  under- 
standing that  they  would  cease  to  use  the  water  when- 
ever the  Pueblo  decided  that  such  use  was  causing  a 
diminution  of  the  needed  municipal  supply. 

The  Act  of  1850,  which  incorporated  the  City  of 
Los  Angeles  under  American  rule,  provided  that  the 
City  should  succeed  to  the  propert\-  rights  and  powers 
of  the  Pueblo. 

In  the  case  Feliz  vs.  Los  Angeles  in  1881,  it  was 
clearly  stated  that  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  had  a 
right  to  all  of  the  waters  of  the  Los  Angeles  River  if 
required  for  municipal  purposes  or  for  use  of  its  in- 
habitants. This  action  was  brought  bv  Anastacio  Feliz 
against  the  Cit\'  for  cutting  water  off  from  his  irriga- 
tion ditch.  The  lower  court  decided  against  the  city, 
but  the  upper  court  reversed  the  decision. 

In  1903,  the  case  of  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  vs. 
Los  Angeles  Farming  and  Milling  Company  was  heard, 
and  the  decree  stated  that  the  Companx'  had  no  right 
to  take  or  use  the  waters  of  the  Los  Angeles  River 
except  in  subordination  to  the  paramount  right  of  tlie 
City  of  Los  Angeles. 

The  case  of  City  of  Los  Angeles  vs.  Lagiina  Irri- 
gation Company  in  1904  had  a  similar  outcome  with 
the  exception  that  all  diversion  works  were  to  be  re- 
moved. 

The  geographic  setting  of  the  case  of  Burr  vs. 
Maclay  Rancbo  ]Vater  Co.,  1908,  was  in  the  vicinit&gt;' 
of  the  Cit\-  of  San  Fernando  and  removed  from  the 
main  tributaries  of  the  Los  Angeles  River.  The  case 
is  of  interest  because  it  \\  as  held  that  the  trial  court 
had  the  power  to  make  reasonable  regulations  for  the

use  of  the  common  suppl\-  of  ground  water  by  the 
respective  parties.  The  decision  fixed  times  during 
whicli  each  party  might  withdraw  water,  as  well  as 
the  quantities  that  might  be  withdrawn. 

The  decision  in  l.os  Angeles  vs.  Biiffingtoii  ct  j/., 
1909,  was  one  of  the  more  important  ones  in  field  of 
water  rigiits  in  that  surface  water  and  ground  water 
were  for  the  first  time  interrchited.  The  State  Supreme 
Court  made  tiie  following  classic  analogy:  "Unques- 
tionably the  San  Fernando  Valley  is  a  great  natural 
reservoir  and  supply  of  the  Los  Angeles  River.  Un- 
qucstionab!\-  the  cutting  off  of  this  suppl&gt;'  w  ould  as 
completcI\-  destroy  the  Los  Angeles  River  as  would 
cutting  off  the  Great  Lakes  destroy  the  St.  Lawrence." 
With  legal  cornerstone  firml\-  in  place,  the  Cit\'  of 
Los  Angeles  filed  the  next  noteworthy  action  in  1938: 
Los  Angeles  vs.  Glendale  and  Ihirhank.  This  case  was 
decided  in  favor  of  the  Cit\'  of  Los  Angeles,  upholding 
the  Pueblo  Right;  however,  the  defendants  were  al- 
lowed to  continue  the  use  of  the  \\  ater  as  long  as  there 
was  a  surplus,  in  other  words,  as  long  as  the  basin  was 
not  being  ovcrdrafted. 

Due  to  the  decline  in  ground  water  levels,  the 
Cit&gt;'  of  Los  Angeles  filed  a  new  action  in  1955,  City 
of  Los  Angeles  vs.  City  of  San  Fernando  et  al.  This 
case  had  over  200  defendants,  each  of  whom  used 
more  than  1  acre-foot  of  ground  water  per  &gt;ear. 

In  June  of  1958,  the  State  Water  Rights  Board 
was  appointed  Referee  by  the  court  under  Section 
2001  of  the  California  Water  Code.  The  Referee  was 
ordered  to  prepare  a  factual  report  that  A\ould  serve 
as  "prima  facie"  evidence  within  the  framework  of  the 
Order  of  Reference.  Certain  items  of  the  Order  of 
Reference  contain  the  subject  material  for  this  paper. 

"1.1  The  geographic  and  hydrologic  boundaries  of  the  water- 
shed of  the  Los  Angeles  River  and  its  tributaries  above  the 
junction  of  the  surfoce  channels  of  the  Los  Angeles  River  and 
the  Arroyo  Seco  at  a  point  designated  as  Los  Angeles  County 
Flood  Control  District  Gaging  Station  F-57." 

The  watershed  above  Cage  F-57  contains  329,000 
acres,  of  which  206,000  acres  are  classed  as  hill-and- 
mountain  areas  and  123,000  acres  are  vallc\-  floor.  The 
Los  .\ngeles  River  is  the  principal  stream  draining 
the  watershed.  The  \'erdugo.  Big  Tuiunga,  Little 
Tujunga,  Pacoima,  Bull  Canyon,  Aliso,  Browns  Can- 
yon, Dayton,  and  Bell  Creeks  and  Arro\ o  Calabasas 
constitute  the  major  secondary-  streams  which  arc 
tributary  to  the  Los  Angeles  River. 

"1.2  The  complete  geology  insofar  as  It  affects  the  occurrence 
and  movement  of  ground  water  and  the  surface  and  ground 
water  hydrology  of  sold  area". 

Ihc  Report  of  Referee  was  completed  in  Jul&gt; 
1962.  The  author  of  this  paper  was  responsible  for 
the  preparation  of  the  geologic  and  w  ater-(]ualit\'  sec- 
tions of  that  report  w  hile  in  the  employ  of  the  Cali- 
fornia Department  of  Water  Resources. 

The  trial  court  in  the  case  City  of  Los  Angeles 
vs.  City  of  San  Fernando  et  al.  found  in  favor  of  the 
defendants  by  ruling  that  prescriptive  rights  prevailed 
over  the  City  of  Los  .\ngclcs  Pueblo  Rights.  This  case 
is  currcntl)'  under  appeal. 

.\  prescriptive  right  to  the  use  of  water  is  based 
on   continuous    use    adverse    to   prior   rights   for   five 


\  ears  and  failure  of  the  owners  of  the  prior  rights  to 
file  legal  action  to  protect  themselves  during  that  time. 
.\ction  b\-  the  owner  of  prior  rights  then  becomes 
barred  b&gt;'  the  statute  of  limitation  and  the  right  of 
the  subsequent  appropriator  is  called  a  prescriptive 
right  to  use  of  water. 

Previous  Investigation 

Previous  bulletins  and  papers  that  dealt  primaril\' 
with  the  geology  near  the  area  of  investigation  pertain 
mainh-  to  the  sedimentary  and  crystalline  rocks  in  the 
hills  and  mountains  around  the  edges  of  the  \alle\-  fill. 

Several  authors  have  divided  the  area  under  in- 
vestigation into  numerous  basins  and  subbasins.  For 
the  most  part,  these  divisions  were  made  at  or  near 
locations  where  there  is  a  change  in  ground  water  stor- 
age capacit&gt;',  a  drainage  (topographic)  divide,  struc- 
tures that  retard  the  flow  of  underground  water  to- 
ward the  Los  Angeles  Narrows  or  a  combination  of 
these  physical  features. 

California  State  Department  of  Public  Works, 
Division  of  Water  Resources,  "South  Coastal  Basin 
Investigation,  Geology  and  Ground  \Vater  Storage 
Capacity  of  \'alley  Fill",  Bulletin  Xo.  45,  1934,  con- 
tains detailed  and  broad  coverage  of  the  geology  of  the 
area  and  the  interrelationship  of  the  geology  and  the 
ground  water.  Particular  reference  is  made  to  the 
geologic  features  of  the  valley  fill  and  to  the  water- 
bearing rocks.  This  work  has  been  studied  in  detail, 
and  data  pertaining  to  specific  \ield  and  storage 
capacity  have  been  slightl\-  modified  and  utilized  in 
the  present  report.  The  modifications  were  based  on 
an  additional  25  years  of  records  and  data.

Well-Numbering  System 

The  well-numbering  svsteni  used  here  is  that  used 
by  the  Los  Angeles  County  Flood  Control  District. 
The  first  two  numbei-s  represent  the  officially  assigned 
luimber  of  the  old  6-minute  quadrangle  series  that 
covered  Los  .\ngeles  County.  Fach  quadrangle  was 
divided  into  a  grid  system  w  ith  the  number  1  through 
9  plus  0  being  assigned  to  both  the  abscissa  and  the 
ordinate.  .\  letter  designation  after  the  numbers  in- 
dicates that  there  is  more  than  one  w  ell  w  ithin  a  given 
grid  location.  .V  w  ell  number  4850-B  w  ould  therefore 
be  located  on  quadrangle  number  48;  5  represents  the 
abscissa  and  0  the  ordinate  location;  and  B  indicates 
that  this  is  the  third  well  to  be  constructed  in  that 
grid  section. 

Hydrologic  Subareas 

The  \alley  floor  is  in  general  an  alluvium-filled 
basin  approximatciv  23  miles  long  and  12  miles  wide.

San  Fernando  Earthquake — Geology  and  Geophysics

Based  on  physiography  and  geologic  features,  the 
vallev  has  been  divided  into  the  four  hydrologic  sub- 
areas  already-  discussed:  the  San  Fernando  subarea,  the 
Svlmar  subarea,  the  \'erdugo  subarea  and  the  Eagle 
Rock  subarea.  Little  is  known  of  the  depth  of  alluvium 
in  the  central  and  eastern  part  of  the  San  Fernando 
subarea,  but  it  may  exceed  1,000  feet  west  of  Burbank. 
The  geologic  events  which  affected  the  valley 
floor  and  the  bordering  hills  and  mountains  as  a  whole 
during  formation  of  the  structural  features  must  be 
considered,  as  well  as  features  now  expressed  by  to- 
pography, in  order  to  depict  their  effect  on  the  occur- 
rence and  movement  of  ground  water. 

g£olog;c  formations 

The  geologic  formations  may  be  divided  into  two 
general  groups:  the  nonwater-bearing  rocks  and  the 
water-bearing  rocks. 

The  nonwater-bearing  rocks  do  not  absorb,  trans- 
mit, or  yield  water  readily.  They  are  the  "Basement 
Complex"  rocks  and  the  Cretaceous  and  Tertiary 
sediments  of  the  "Chico"  formation  and  the  Martinez, 
Domengine,  Topanga,  Modelo  (Puente),  Repetto,  and 
Pico  Formations.  Water  wells  pumping  from  these 
rock  units  generally  yield  less  than  100  gallons  per 
minute. 

The  water-bearing  rocks — all  of  which  absorb, 
transmit,  and  yield  water  readily — consist  of  alluvial 
deposits  of  Quaternary  age  and  include  the  Saugus 
Formation,  older  alluvium  (including  "terrace"  de- 
posits), and  Holocene  alluvium.  This  study  deals 
mainly  with  the  character  and  extent  of  the  water- 
bearing rocks.  Properly  designed  and  constructed 
water  wells  may  yield  more  than  2000  gallons  per 
minute  from  these  rock  units. 

The  stratigraphy  of  the  area  of  investigation  is 
shown  in  table  1. 

The  geological  mapping  performed  by  many  pre- 
vious workers  has  been  compiled  and  supplemented 
where  necessary  by  work  of  the  staff  of  the  Water 
Rights  Board  and  is  presented  as  figure  1,  "Areal 
Geology". 

Nonwater-Bearing  Rocks 

The  nonwater-bearing  rocks,  which  are  made  up 
of  relatively  impervious  formations  that  underlie  and 
surround  the  more  pervious  formations,  differ  from 
the  water-bearing  rocks  in  three  respects:  (1)  the 
nonwater-bearing  rocks  are  for  the  most  part  rela- 
tively impervious  and  therefore  store  comparatively 
little  water  which  they  yield  to  wells  very  slowly; 
(2)  where  per\-ious  beds  or  zones  occur  within  the 
nonwater-bearing  rocks,  the  movement  of  ground 
water  and  recharge  from  outcrops  is  generally  so 
restricted  b\'  faults,  structural  position,  or  physical 
character  of  the  materials  that  supplies  of  water  ob- 
tained from  such  beds  or  zones  are  too  limited  to  be 
comparable  to  ground  water  supplies  obtainable  from 
the  water-bearing  rocks;  and  (3)  the  quality  of  the 
water  found  in  some  of  these  rock  units  is  generally 
unsuitable  for  most  beneficial  uses. 

There  are  several  types  of  openings  in  the  non- 
water-bearing rocks,  including:   original  interstices  in 


porous  beds  of  the  sedimentary  rocks;  interstices  in 
the  weathered  zone;  fractures  and  joint  openings  below 
the  surface  (including  openings  along  bedding  planes 
and  planes  of  schistosity);  and  openings  caused  or  en- 
larged by  solution  of  the  country  rock. 

In  most  places,  both  the  sedimentary  and  cr\stal- 
line  nonwater-bearing  rocks  are  so  impervious  that 
they  &gt;ield  ver\-  little  water  to  wells  and  consequently 
are  of  no  value  except  for  domestic  or  stock-\\'atering 
purposes.  The  limited  amount  of  water  contained  in 
the  nonwater-bearing  series  in  the  hill  and  mountain 
areas  is  available  for  transpiration  and  evaporation, 
and  for  effluent  stream  flow.  Since  the  rate  of  move- 
ment of  \\ater  through  the  nonwater-bearing  rocks  is 
generally  slow,  water  derived  from  one  season's  pre- 
cipitation may  be  held  over  for  ensuing  years.  In  a 
few  places,  pervious  strata  or  fracture  zones  in  the 
nonwater-bearing  rocks  may  yield  water  freely  to 
wells.  However,  in  most  cases  such  production  is  short 
lived  because  of  the  relatively  small  storage  capacity 
and  inadequate  recharge  areas. 

Water-Bearing  Rocks 

Ground  water  occurs  in  three  principal  \\ater- 
bearing  formations;  the  Pleistocene  Saugus  Formation 
(including  upper  Pliocene  Sunshine  Ranch  beds),  Late 
Quaternary  older  alluvium  (including  Pacoima  Forma- 
tion and   terrace  deposits),   and   Holocene   alluvium. 

Lower  Pleistocene  Saiigiis  FoiDiation.  The  Sau- 
gus Formation  in  the  San  Fernando  Valley  is  gener- 
ally restricted  to  marine  and  terrestrial  deposits  of 
probable  lower  Pleistocene  age  (Oakeshott,  1958) 
usually  lying  ^\•ith  angular  unconformit\'  on  formations 
of  all  ages  from  the  Basement  Complex  to  the  Pico 
Formation. 

The  Saugus  Formation  crops  out  in  the  hills  and 
southern  flanks  of  the  mountains  along  the  northern 
portion  of  the  valley  floor  and  underlies  the  other 
water-bearing  sediments.  The  maximum  thickness  is 
6400  feet  as  measured  on  the  east  side  of  Lopez  Can- 
\on.  Two  miles  east  of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon,  the 
formation  thins  rapidl}'  to  2000  feet.  The  formation 
also  thins  in  a  southwesterly  direction  to  about  3000 
feet  at  the  Van  Norman  Reservoirs.  There  are  no  out- 
crops of  the  Saugus  Formation  in  the  Santa  Monica 
Mountains,  Simi  Hills,  or  \^erdugo  Mountains,  indi- 
cating that  the  formation  is  restricted  to  the  northern 
portion  of  the  valley. 

The  ^\•ater-bearing  portion  of  the  Saugus  Forma- 
tion consists  of  light-colored,  poorly  sorted,  looseh- 
consolidated  conglomerate  and  coarse  sandstone,  com- 
monly cross-bedded,  which  ^\■ere  deposited  as  fluviatile 
and  alluvial  fan  sediments.  Throughout  the  Saugus 
Formation,  layers  and  lenses  of  clayc\"  gravel  have 
been  formed  by  \\eathering  of  the  original  materials 
in  place. 

In  general,  the  water-bearing  capacity  of  the  Sau- 
gus Formation  is  somewhat  lo\\er  than  the  older  allu- 
vium (terrace  deposits). 

Upper  Pleistocene  older  alhiviinii  (terrace  depos- 
its). The  lower,  more  folded  portions  of  the  older 
alluvium  have  been  differentiated  by  some  investigators 
from  the  less  folded  deposits  and  the  name  Pacoima 
Formation  (Oakeshott,  1958)  has  been  proposed  for

this  middle  Pleistocene  deposit.  Except  for  the  more 
pronounced  folding  and  overthrusting  of  Basement 
Complex,  there  is  little  difference  between  this  unit 
and  the  remainder  of  the  older  alluvium. 

The  older  alluvium  was  derived  from  deposits 
left  by  modern  streams  in  earlier  cycles  of  erosion 
with  the  source  areas  little  different  from  those  of 
the  present  streams. 

Lithologically,  the  materials  in  all  the  older  allu- 
vium and  terraces  are  broadly  similar,  consisting  of 
brown  to  grayish,  dirt\',  unsorted,  angular  to  sub- 
angular  detritus,  entirely  of  local  origin.  There  are 
numerous  breaks  in  the  deposition  of  the  material 
during  which  extensive  weathering  took  place,  form- 
ing horizons  of  ancient  soils.  Consolidation  is  poor, 
and  the  deposits  are  only  locally  cemented.  Deposition 
of  alluvial  materials  now  taking  place  indicates  that 
topography  and  drainage  were  nearly  similar  when 
the  older  alluvial  deposits  were  being  laid  down.  The 
belts  of  terrace  deposits  are  broader  than  present 
stream  deposits  in  some  places  and  were  probably 
formed  by  streams  flowing  at  slightly  lower  gradients 
and  in  broader  valleys.  This  would  be  a  logical  ex- 
planation, in  part,  because  of  the  finer  grained  nature 
of  some  of  the  older  alluvium  as  compared  to  the 
Holocene  deposits.  The  main  explanation  for  the 
higher  clay  content  is  the  formaion  of  residual  clays 
by  weathering. 

The  water-bearing  character  of  these  deposits  is 
variable,  depending  upon  the  source  area.  West  of  the 
vicinity  of  Van  Norman  Reservoir  and  along  the 
southern  boundary  of  the  valley,  local  streams  from 
the  hills  have  deposited  fine  debris  derived  from  the 
predominantly  sedimentary  rocks  of  that  region.  East 
of  Van  Norman  Reservoir,  Pacoima  Creek,  Big  Tu- 
junga  Creek,  Little  Tujunga  Creek,  V^erdugo  Creek, 
and  other  streams  have  deposited  alluvial  cones  which 
consist  almost  entirely  of  coarse  crystalline  debris 
from  the  mountains  to  the  north  and  east. 

Holocefie  alhiviiim.  Rejuvenation  caused  in- 
creased gradients  of  the  streams  tributary  to  the  Los 
Angeles  River  at  the  close  of  Pleistocene  time  and 
accelerated  erosion  from  the  mountains  and  deposition 
in  the  valley.  Holocene  deposits  east  of  Pacoima  Wash 
and  north  of  the  Los  Angeles  River  consist  of  pre- 
dominantly coarse,  thick  accumulations  of  boulder, 
gravel,  and  sand  in  coalescing  alluvial  fans,  becoming 
finer  grained  farther  from  the  canyon  mouths.  West 
of  Pacoima  Wash  and  south  of  the  Los  Angeles  River, 
the  sediments  \\ere  derived  from  predominantly  sedi- 
mentary rocks,  are  finer  grained,  and  were  deposited 
in  much  the  same  manner  as  the  underlying  older 
alluvium. 

Character  of  Quaternary  u-ater-bearing  alluvhnii. 
As  previously  stated,  the  sediments  in  the  western  por- 
tion of  the  valley  floor  are  of  a  different  nature  than 
those  found  in  the  eastern  portion  and,  therefor,  have 
different  ^\•ater-bearing  characteristics. 

It  was  not  possible  to  distinguish  the  Saugus  For- 
mation from  the  older  alluvium  by  using  the  available 
well  logs,  with  the  exception  of  the  Sylmar  hydro- 
logic  subarea,  so  it  was  assumed  that  in  all  other  areas 
the  two  formations  had  similar  water-bearing  charac- 
teristics. 


Well  logs  show  the  western  part  of  the  valley 
floor  to  have  an  average  of  about  75  percent  clay,  5 
percent  sand,  and  20  percent  gravel.  Although  the 
smaller  streams  of  this  area  probably  bring  down  con- 
siderable amounts  of  fine  material,  the  low  percentage 
of  sand  compared  to  gravel  suggests  that  the  finer 
grained  components  have  been  decomposed  to  clay. 
These  sedimentary  materials  probably  break  down 
more  readily  under  the  influence  of  weathering  than  do 
the  crystalline  rocks  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the 
valley.  An  average  analysis  of  material  from  wells  of 
the  coarser  crystalline  material  in  the  eastern  portion 
of  the  valley  floor  shows  20  percent  clay,  35  percent 
sand,  and  45  percent  gravel.  These  deposits  were  orig- 
inally coarser  than  those  farther  west  and  apparently 
do  not  break  down  as  quickly  through  weathering. 
The  coarser  grained  materials  exhibit  noticeable  dif- 
ference in  directional  permeability. 

SJRUCIURAL  FEATURES 

The  structure  of  the  Upper  Los  Angeles  River 
Area  is  rather  complicated.  The  rough  topography  of 
the  Basement  Complex  and  extensive  folding  and  fault- 
ing of  the  rocks  in  the  hills  and  mountains  indicate 
that  the  older  rocks  beneath  the  alluvium  of  the  valley 
are  folded  and  possibly  faulted;  therefore,  the  over- 
lying alluvium  probably  varies  in  thickness.  With  the 
exception  of  the  faulting  and  folding  along  the  north- 
ern half  of  the  valley,  there  is  no  definite  evidence 
that  any  of  the  other  faults  or  folds  have  influenced 
the  Holocene  alluvium. 

Faulting 

Structure  of  the  area  is  dominated  by  the  San 
Gabriel  fault  system.  The  north  dipping  thrust  faults 
of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains,  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  fault  in  the  Santa 
Susana  Mountains  on  the  north,  and  the  faulted  anti- 
clinal structure  of  the  Santa  Monica  .Mountains  on 
the  south  are  also  important  fault  features. 

San  Gabriel  fault  zone.  The  San  Gabriel  fault 
zone  has  strong  topographic  expression — the  faults 
appearing  prominently  on  aerial  photographs  because 
of  displaced  geologic  units,  offset  drainage,  strike 
valleys,  notched  ridges,  subparallel  faulting,  fracturing, 
and  folding. 

Verdiigo  fault  zone.  The  \''erdugo  fault  zone 
along  the  south  edge  of  the  \'erdugo  Mountains,  ap- 
proximately parallel  to  San  Fernando  Road,  and  the 
Eagle  Rock  fault  to  the  east  appear  to  be  a  part  of,  or 
are  related  to,  the  San  Gabriel  fault  system. 

Sierra  Madre  fatilt  zone.  The  Sierra  Madre  fault 
zone  is  a  series  of  curved,  convex-southward,  reverse 
faults,  which  separates  nonwater-bearing  sedimentary 
and  pre-Tertiary  crystalline  rocks  on  the  north  from 
the  Cenozoic  sedimentary  formations  on  the  south. 
The  faults  are  discontinuous  and  dip  from  15  degrees 
to  vertical;  all  dip  northward  \\ith  the  older  sedimen- 
tary and  crystalline  rocks  thrust  upward  toward  the 
south  over  sediments  as  late  as  the  mid-Pleistocene 
Pacoima  Formation  of  the  water-bearing  series.  Dis- 
placements have  been  essentially  of  the  dip-slip  t\pe 
and  are  as  great  as  2,000  feet  on  any  one  fault.  Dis-

placement  rapidly  dies  out  as  the  strikx  of  each  of 
these  reverse  faults  changes  from  the  general  east-west 
trend  to  a  more  northerly  trend. 

Northriiigc  Hills  (atilt.  The  Northridgc  Hills 
fault  is  a  high-angle  fault.  Knowledge  of  its  existence 
is  based  primarily-  on  the  numerous  oil  test  iioles  which 
have  been  drilled  in  the  Northridge  Hills.  Logs  of 
these  wells  indicate  that  the  Alodelo  Formation  has 
been  displaced  between  500  and  1,000  feet  along  the 
dip  of  the  fault.  The  apparent  movement  along  the 
fault  has  been  dip-slip  with  the  north  block  up. 

Mission  Hills  fiiiilt.  A  minor  fault  zone  compris- 
ing three  faults  is  perfectly  exposed  in  Sepulveda 
Boulevard  road  cuts  just  cast  of  Lower  \'an  Norman 
Reservoir  in  the  .Mission  Hills.  These  faults  are  prob- 
ably related  to  both  tiic  San  Gabriel  and  the  Sierra 
Madrc  fault  s\stems.  The  most  southerly  of  these 
fault  planes  is  a  60  degree  south-dipping  reverse  fault 
with  rocks  of  the  .Modelo  Formation  on  the  nortii 
limb  of  the  Pacoima  Hill  anticline  thrust  over  the 
lower  Pliocene  Rcpctto  Formation.  The  next  fault 
north  dips  55  degrees  south  and  has  thrust  Rcpctto 
.sandstone  over  fossiliferous  sand.stonc  of  the  middle 
Pliocene  lower  member  of  the  Pico  Formation.  The 
most  northerly  of  the  group  is  a  normal  fault  dipping 
75  degrees  north,  with  upper  Pliocene  beds  down 
dropped. 

Pacoivm  Hills  fault.  \  well-exposed  east-trend- 
ing normal  fault  dipping  50  degrees  north  in  the  Pa- 
coima Hills  has  brought  Basement  Complex  up  on  the 
south  side  against  sedimentary  and  volcanic  rocks  of 
the  Topanga  Formation.  Four  miles  east  in  the  Ver- 
dugo  Mountains,  these  formations  are  in  unconform- 
able contact.  Displacement  along  this  fault  may  be 
small.  Bailey  and  Jahns  (1954)  projected  this  fault  5 
miles  east  as  a  buried  extension  along  the  south  side 
of  Tujunga  \'alle_\\  However,  the  most  reasonable 
structural  section  shows  no  necessity  for  a  Tujunga 
Valley  fault  (Oakeshott,   1958). 

Raymond  fault.*  The  Ra&gt;'mond  fault  separates 
tile  Topanga  Formation  in  the  northern  upthrown 
block  from  the  iModcIo  Formation  in  the  south  block. 
It  is  mostly  concealed  by  the  older  alluvium  along 
York  Boulevard,  but  evidence  of  its  approximate  loca- 
tion is  given  by  outcrops  near  the  fault  zone.  This 
fault  is  ver\-  likely  a  high-angle  reverse  fault,  as  shown 
by  overturned  beds  in  the  Topanga  Formation  along 
the  .Arroyo  Seco. 

Eagle  Rock  fault.  The  Eagle  Rock  fault  sepa- 
rates the  Basement  Complex  rocks  to  the  north  from 
the  Topanga  Formation  to  the  south.  It  is  a  vertical  or 
high-angle  reverse  fault  with  the  north  block  up 
(Weldon,  1955).  No  alluvium  has  been  displaced  by 
the  Eagle  Rock  fault,  indicating  that  movement  on  this 
fault  stopped  before  movement  stopped  on  the  Ray- 
mond fault.  The  questionable  extension  of  the  Eagle 
Rock  fault  westward  to  the  Verdugo  fault  is  based 
on  a  steplikc  difference  in  ground  water  level  in  the 

•  The  Raymond  fault  was  named  by  Dr.  .T.  P.  Biiwalda  in  his 
definitive  1040  unpiibli.shed  report  on  the  Raymond  Basin. 
The  name  "Raymond  Hill  fault"  i.s  used  on  plate  1,  this 
bulletin.  .\11  reports  on  the  ground  water  geology  of  the 
area  have  used  the  name  "Raymond  fault." 


mouth  of  Verdugo  Canyon.  The  general  structural 
pattern  also  suggests  that  the  Eagle  Rock  fault  may 
be  related  to  the  X'^erdugo  fault  system. 

Effects  of  Faulting  on  Ground  Water  Movenfient 

There  are  numerous  wa_\s  in  w hich  faulting  may 
affect  the  movement  of  ground  water.  Some  of  the 
more  important  are  listed  as  follows: 

1.  Impervious  rock  may  be  brought  into  contact  with  the 
water-bearing  series,  thus  reducing  the  underflow  cross-sec- 
tional  area. 

2.  Continuous  pervious  strata  in  the  alluvium  ma/  be  offset 
and  mode  discontinuous. 

3.  Impervious  gouge  may  be  formed  as  a  result  of  the  grind- 
ing   action    during    recurrent    movement   along   the    fault. 

4.  Repeated  uplift  and  depression  of  one  or  both  sides  of  a 
fault  block  may  allow  alternate  weathering  of  the  surface 
deposits  with  resultant  formation  of  large  quantities  of  im- 
pervious residual  clay  in  the  vicinity  of  the  fault. 

5.  Strata  may  be  folded  or  overturned  so  that  their  position 
is  unfavorable  for  percolation  of  water  through  them. 

6.  Fault  fractures  may  be  sealed  by  chemical  deposits. 

7.  Brittle  material  may  become  cracked  or  brecciated,  thus 
creating  a  more  permeable  condition  along  the  line  of  fault- 
ing, which  will  allow  the  zone  to  act  as  a  conduit  and  carry 
water.  This  condition  has  been  observed  to  exist  to  a  minor 
extent  in  the  vicinity  of  the  water  supply  tunnels  in  the  Ver- 
dugo suborea. 

A  combination  of  all  but  the  first  and  last  phe- 
nomena is  believed  to  have  resulted  in  the  formation 
of  an  impediment  along  the  A'crdugo  and  La  Tuna  Can- 
\on  faults.  Extensive  research  and  work  lias  been  done 
by  the  Los  .\ngeles  County  Flood  Control  District  on 
the  effect  of  these  faults  on  their  spreading  operation 
of  water  from  Hansen  Dam   (Thayer,   1945). 

Folding 

In  the  San  Fernando  \"alley,  regional  dips  of  the 
sedimentary  formations  are  away  from  the  pre-Cre- 
taceous  crystalline  rocks  which  form  the  mountains 
around  the  valle\-.  Unconformities  between  the  suc- 
cessive Cretaceous,  Tertiar\-,  and  Quaternary  forma- 
tions show  that  otogenic  movements  took  place 
locally  at  various  times;  but  the  mid-Pleistocene  oro- 
geny overshadowed  all  of  the  others  in  intensity.  Dur- 
ing the  faulting  and  the  accompan\-ing  folding,  the 
crystalline  rocks  beha\e  esscntiall\-  as  a  competent 
block  undergoing  intermittent  elevation  with  adjust- 
ments within  the  block  accompanied  by  faulting, 
shearing,  and  fracturing,  .\round  the  margins  of  the 
Basement  Complex,  the  sedimentary-  strata  reacted  ac- 
cording to  their  competence  and  the  local  intensit\' 
of  the  stresses  applied  by  developing  a  series  of  dis- 
continuous folds  closely  related  to  the  faults.  Coni- 
monI\-,  local  synclines  are  developed  on  the  down- 
dropped  fault  blocks  and  anticlines  on  the  upthrown 
blocks. 

The  dominant  fold  structures  affecting  the  storage 
and  flow  of  underground  water  in  tlie  San  Fernando 
X'alley  arc  located  onl\-  along  the  northern  border  of 
the  valle\'.  Inasmuch  as  the  other  folds  have  little  or 
no  effect  on  the  ground  water,  no  extensive  study  was 
made  of  them. 

The  Little  Tujunga  syncline  (figure  1),  located

fault,  is  one  of  the  principal  structural  features  along 
the  north  edge  of  the  valley.  The  axis  of  this  fold 
closely  parallels  the  trace  of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault 
zone,  following  it  with  a  west-northwest  trend  in  the 
area  from  Tujunga  to  the  Veterans  Administration 
Hospital  at  Pacoima  Canyon,  \\here  it  has  been  over- 
ridden by  the  crystalline  rocks  along  the  Hospital 
fault. 

The  Verdugo  Mountains,  Pacoima  Hills,  and  Mis- 
sion Hills  comprise  the  remnants  of  an  elevated, 
faulted  anticlinal  block  trending  north  IS  degrees  west 
across  the  northern  part  of  the  valley.  Structurally, 
the  highest  part  of  this  block  is  in  the  central  part  of 
the  Verdugo  Mountains,  where  granitic  rocks  are  ex- 
posed. This  anticlinal  structure  is  flanked  by  the  To- 
panga  and  Modelo  Formations  and  plunges  westward 
to  the  vicinity  of  Hansen  Flood  Control  Dam.  It  is 
faulted  up  to  expose  granitic  rocks  and  the  Topanga 
Formation  in  the  Pacoima  Hills,  and  plunges  west  an 
estimated  8600  feet  in  the  next  4  miles  (Oakeshott, 
1958). 

The  most  prominent  fold  of  the  Mission  Hills 
is  the  east-trending  Mission  Hills  anticline  just  south 
of  Lower  Van  Norman  Reservoir,  which  exposes  dia- 
tomaceous  shale  of  the  Modelo  Formation  at  the  south- 
east end  of  the  reservoir.  This  fold  may  be  the  result 
of  drag  on  the  Allssion  Hills  thrust  fault.  The  strong 
westward  plunge  of  this  structure  is  indicated  by  Re- 
petto,  lower  Pico,  and  upper  Pico  beds  which  suc- 
cessively overlie  exposures  of  the  Modelo  Formation 
on  the  north  and  south  limbs  of  the  anticline. 

Geophysical  studies  of  nonwater-bearing  rocks  in 
the  western  portion  of  the  San  Fernando  hydrologic 
subareas  made  by  various  oil  companies  show  a  series 
of  three  synclines  with  two  intervening  anticlines  that 
have  an  easterly  plunge  in  the  nonwater-bearing  rocks. 
This  structure  is  somewhat  simpler  than  was  originally 
postulated  by  Eckis  in  California  Division  of  Water 
Resources  Bulletin  45  (1934). 

QUAJERNAR-f  GEOLOGIC  HISTORY 

The  rise  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  and  other 
ranges  and  hills  was  accelerated  during  early  Pleisto- 
cene time.  The  water-bearing  Saugus  Formation  (in- 
cluding Sunshine  Ranch  Formation,  Oakeshott,  1958) 
is  represented  b)'  fluviatile  and  alluvial  fan  sediments 
derived  during  the  early  Pleistocene  from  the  then 
existing  San  Gabriel  Alountains.  The  sediments  from 
the  San  Gabriels  merge  into  marine  sediments  derived 
from  the  Santa  Susana  Mountains  to  the  west.  There  is 
no  evidence  of  a  similar  deposit  along  the  base  of  the 
Santa  Monica  Mountains,  indicating  that  during  Sau- 
gus time  this  portion  of  the  area  was  undergoing 
erosion. 

The  mid-Pleistocene  orogen\'  was  the  major  event 
in  building  the  modern  mountain  ranges  and  hills 
around  the  perimeter  of  the  valley.  At  that  time,  the 
Saugus  and  all  older  formations  were  intensely  folded, 
and  large  movements  took  place  in  the  San  Gabriel 
and  other  fault  zones  at  the  northern  edge  of  the 
valley.  The  Santa  Monica  Mountains,  Simi  Hills,  and 
Santa  Susana  Mountains  were  elevated  with  the  latter 
two  cutting  off  the  San  Fernando  Valley  from  the 


Ventura  Basin.  The  major  streams  accelerated  their 
erosion  and  incised  deep  canyons  in  the  mountains. 
Some  of  the  first  products  of  post-Saugus  erosion  are 
represented  in  the  dark  brow  n  and  reddish  fanglomer- 
ate  of  the  Pacoima  Formation  (Oakeshott,  1958). 
Strata  of  this  formation  have  been  locally  folded  in 
and  near  fault  zones,  particularly  in  the  fault  zone 
west  of  the  Veterans  Administration  Hospital  north 
of  San  Fernando. 

Post-Saugus  erosion  of  the  higher  lands  has  con- 
tinued through  upper  Pleistocene  to  the  present  time. 
Erosion  during  this  time  has  been  modified,  acceler- 
ated, or  interrupted  by  repeated  elevation  of  the 
mountain  masses.  A  succession  of  terraces  produced  by 
deposition  from  the  various  streams  has  been  devel- 
oped and  then  incised  or  eroded  as  the  stream  gradient 
has  been  modified.  Most  of  the  terrace  deposits  paral- 
lel present  drainage  courses,  indicating  that  they  were 
left  by  these  same  streams  in  earlier  cycles  of  erosion. 

Erosion  and  elevation  of  the  land  mass  has  con- 
tinued to  the  present  time.  The  alluvial  fill  during  this 
time  has  been  derived  from  t\vo  types  of  material, 
which  have  had  a  profound  effect  on  the  permeability 
of  the  aquifers  and  on  the  quality  of  the  water.  West 
of  the  vicinity  of  \'an  Norman  Reservoir  complex  and 
along  the  southern  portion  of  the  valley,  local  streams 
from  the  hills  have  deposited  debris  from  predomi- 
nantly sedimentary  rocks  of  that  region  forming  rela- 
tively tight  deposits  that  have  low  specific  yields.  East 
of  the  \'an  Norman  Reservoirs,  the  streams  of  the 
Pacoima,  Little  and  Big  Tujunga,  Verdugo,  and  other 
drainages  along  the  northern  edge  of  the  valley  have 
formed  alluvial  fans  consisting  almost  entirely  of 
coarse  crystalline  debris  of  high  specific  yields  from 
the  San   Gabriel  and  V^erdugo  Mountains. 

The  coalescing  alluvial  fans  from  the  major  trib- 
utaries to  the  north  have  forced  the  Los  Angeles  River 
to  the  southern  margin  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley. 

GEOLOGIC  CONDITIONS  AFFECTING 
OCCURRENCE  AND  MOVEMENT  OF  GROUND  WATER 

Geologic  conditions,  along  with  the  supply  and 
disposal  of  water  itself,  control  the  occurrence  and 
movement  of  ground  water  in  the  Upper  Los  Angeles 
River  Basin.  Features  such  as  faults,  folds,  and  litho- 
logic  variations  have  a  pronounced  effect  on  the  eleva- 
tion of  the  ground  water  surface  and  the  direction  of 
ground  water  movement. 

The  source  of  ground  water  suppl&gt;'  to  the  hy- 
drologic subareas  is  infiltration  of  direct  rainfall,  sur- 
face runoff  from  adjacent  hill  and  mountain  areas, 
artificial  spreading  of  surface  runoff  and  imported 
waters,  and  a  minor  amount  of  underground  percola- 
tion of  water  from  the  mountain  masses  to  the  allu- 
vium. Outflow  of  the  supply  is  by  pumping  for  man's 
consumptive  use,  export,  surface  runoff,  and  by  under- 
flow of  small  amounts  out  of  the  area  through  the 
Los  Angeles  Narrows. 

The  Basement  Complex,  the  pre-Quaternar&gt;'  sedi- 
ments, and  the  volcanic  rocks  which  underlie  the 
study  area  at  depth  are  relatively  impervious;  and  any 
contribution  of  ground  water  from  them  is  probably 
small.  The  investigation  has  revealed  no  evidence  of

subsurface    outflow    other    than    througli    the    Los 
Angeles  Narrows. 

San  Fernando  Hydrologic  Subarea 

All  but  about  9  percent  of  the  upper  Los  Angeles 
River  ground  \\ater  basin  is  included  in  the  San  Fer- 
nando hydrologic  subarea.  The  subarea  is  readil\'  di- 
vided into  eastern  and  western  units  on  the  basis  of 
the  type  of  alluvial  fill  in  each  unit.  The  valle\'  fill 
of  the  western  portion  of  the  area  is  essentially  fine- 
grained material  derived  from  the  surrounding  sedi- 
mentary rocks.  These  fine-grained  materials  transmit 
water  at  a  relatively  slow  rate,  whereas  the  coarse- 
grained detritus  of  the  eastern  portion  of  the  subarea 
transmits  water  at  a  relatively  fast  rate.  The  coarse- 
grained detritus,  with  high  permeabilities  and  high 
yields,  has  been  eroded  mainh'  from  the  granitic 
Basement  Complex.  The  deposits  are  essentially  sand 
and  gravel  with  some  fine  material  in  the  interstices; 
in  places,  boulders  up  to  3  feet  in  diameter  are  rela- 
tively common.  The  ground  water  storage  capacity 
of  the  coarse  deposits  of  the  eastern  unit  is  much 
greater  than  that  of  the  fine  deposits  in  the  west.  In 
In  fact,  about  two-thirds  of  the  ground  water  in 
storage  in  the  San  Fernando  hydrologic  subarea  lies 
beneath  the  eastern  third  of  the  surface  area. 

Western  portion.  In  the  northwestern  portion  of 
the  subarea,  a  prominent  fault  extends  northeastward 
from  the  vicinity  of  Chatsworth  Reservoir,  crossing 
Topanga  Canyon  Boulevard  and  Devonshire  Street  in 
the  valley  fill  (figure  1).  This  fault  has  displaced  the 
nonwater-bearing  materials  forming  a  steep  ground 
water  gradient  on  the  order  of  80  feet  in  height.  The 
area  is  underlain  at  shallow  depths  by  Cretaceous  sand- 
stone northwest  of  the  fault  and  the  Alodelo  shale  at 
greater  depth  south  of  the  fault. 

The  Xorthridge  Hills  fault  forms  a  barrier,  or 
partial  barrier,  to  the  movement  of  ground  water 
either  by  offsetting  permeable  beds  or  by  bringing 
less  permeable  materials  closer  to  the  surface.  The 
exact  difference  in  water  levels  across  the  fault  is  not 
known.  To  the  east,  the  upper  portion  of  the  fault  has 
presumably  been  removed  by  erosion  by  the  combined 
action  of  Pacoima  and  Tujunga  Creeks. 

The  small  arcuate  fault  shown  west  of  the  inter- 
section of  Balboa  Boulevard  and  \'entura  Boulevard 
has  had  no  known  effect  on  the  movement  of  ground 
water.  The  existence  of  this  fault  is  based  primarily  on 
the  apparent  vertical  offset  of  the  upper  member  of 
the  Alodelo  Formation  that  crops  out  on  the  north 
side  of  the  fault. 

Ground  water  is  nearer  the  surface  in  the  western 
portion  of  the  hydrologic  subarea.  This  area  is 
bounded  on  the  east  by  Reseda  Boulevard,  on  the  south 
b\'  the  Los  Angeles  River  and  to  the  west  by  Topanga 
Canyon  Boulevard.  The  northern  boundary  is  some- 
what irregular,  extending  north  of  Roscoe  Boulevard 
near  Reseda  Boulevard.  This  area  was  studied  in  detail 
by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture,  Soil  Conserva- 
tion Service,  during  the  period  1947  through  1950 
(Donnan  et  j/.,  1950).  Their  investigation  pointed  out 
the  following  conclusions: 

Wafer  level  fluctuations  recorded  by  the  piezometers  installed 
by  the  Soil  Conservation  Service  were  cyclic  with  precipitation; 


these  water  levels  also  responded  to  irrigation  water  applied 
in  excess  of  the  consumptive  use;  and  deep  artesian  and/or 
pressure  wells  within  the  orea  leaked  into  the  shallow  rone 
to  the  extent  that  small  ground  water  mounds  were  developed 
around  certain  wells.  The  source  of  the  confined  water  ap- 
pears to  be  aquifers  in  the  Saugus  Formation.  The  Saugus 
Formation  presumably  underlies  the  alluvium  at  relatively 
shallow  depths.  These  aquifers  are  recharged  by  precipita* 
tion  on  the  surface  exposure  of  the  Saugus  Formation  to  the 
north. 

Ground  water  under  pressure  in  the  western  por- 
tion of  the  subarea  is  in  small  localized  gravel  lenses 
confined  by  clay  strata. 

Eastern  portion.  The  over-all  permeability  of  the 
alluvial-fan  deposits  below  Hansen  Dam  has  been  re- 
duced by  faulting.  Gravel  beds  displaced  by  thin  clay 
seams  in  the  fault  planes  have  been  observed  at  the 
130-foot  level  in  the  Arrow  Rock  Products  gravel 
pit  south  of  well  4916-B.  These  sheared  gravels  do  not 
represent  the  main  trace  of  the  Verdugo  fault;  how- 
ever, they  illustrate  how  the  associated  faults  may 
act  as  partial  barriers  to  the  movement  of  ground 
water. 

There  are  two  marked  breaks  in  the  ground 
water  surface  in  this  area.  The  first  essentially  under- 
lies Hansen  Dam  and  appears  to  be  a  steep  ground 
water  gradient  over  the  north-dipping  Modelo  sand- 
stone on  which  the  dam  is  founded  and  into  the  upper 
portion  of  the  area  near  the  gravel  pits.  A  well,  lo- 
cated about  1000  feet  .south  of  Hansen  Dam,  and 
the  exploratory  drill  holes  for  the  dam  (La  Rue,  1943) 
indicate  that  nonwater-bearing  rocks  are  at  about  900 
feet  elevation,  whereas  approximately  10,000  feet  south 
of  Hansen  Dam  near  the  \"erdugo  fault  zone  the  base 
of  the  water-bearing  rocks  is  about  600  feet  deeper, 
Iving  between  elevation  200  and  300  feet  above  sea 
level.  The  second  break  in  the  ground  water  surface 
is  at  the  Verdugo  fault.  On  January  20,  1945,  there 
was  a  75-foot  difference  in  the  elevation  of  the  water 
table  observed  between  wells  4895  and  4905-A.  These 
wells  straddle  the  \"erdugo  fault  and  are  3000  feet 
apart.  The  difference  in  ground  surface  elevation  be- 
tween the  wells  is  28  feet.  Considering  the  high  per- 
meabilitv  of  the  aquifers  tapped  by  these  wells  and 
the  lack  of  heavy  draft  in  the  area,  a  water  table  with 
an  over-all  slope  of  1 50  feet  per  mile,  about  2  !&lt;  times 
as  great  as  the  surface  slope,  seems  improbable  when 
compared  to  the  normal  water  table  slope  in  the  north- 
ern part  of  San  Fernando  A'alley.  The  normal  slope 
of  the  water  table  in  these  sediments  is  about  15  feet 
per  mile  or  about  a  third  of  the  surface  slope.  These 
facts  alone  warrant  the  assumption  that  the  \'erdugo 
fault  zone  is  at  least  a  partial  barrier  to  the  movement 
of  ground  water.  Observations  of  this  condition  were 
initially  reported  by  Warren  N.  Thayer  (1945)  of 
the  Los  Angeles  County  Flood  Control  District. 

Between  the  southeastern  corner  of  the  Mission 
Hills  and  the  southwestern  side  of  the  Pacoima  Hills, 
there  is  a  very  sharp  difference  in  the  ground  water 
surface  of  approximately  250  feet.  This  discontinuit\- 
in  water  levels  is  discernible  between  wells  4841  and 
4842.  It  is  assumed  that  this  feature  is  caused  by  a 
difference  in  the  elevation  of  the  underlying  non- 
water-bearing materials.  \'ery  little  is  known  about

this  feature  because  of  the  lack  of  mcH  data  in  the 
vicinit)". 

Another  difference  in  ground  w  ater  levels  is  pres- 
ent in  tiic  Suniand  area  adjacent  to  Tujunga  Wash. 
This  difference  apparently-  is  due  to  faulting  in  the 
nonwater-bcaring  rocks  with  the  water  surface  being 
about  ."iO  feet  lower  on  the  northwest,  Tujunga  Wash 
side  of  the  feature. 

A  steplike  w  atcr  surface  is  present  below  the  sub- 
merged X'erdugo  dam  of  tiie  Cit&gt;-  of  Glcndale.  The 
submerged  dam  is  located  beneath  tiie  Cit\'  of  Glcn- 
dale X'erdugo  Recreation  .Area.  The  steps  in  the  water 
surface  are  due  to  the  offsets  in  the  Basement  Com- 
plex along  the  \''erdugo  fault  zone.  No  surface  evi- 
dence of  any  faults  that  might  form  a  barrier  to  the 
movement  of  ground  water  has  been  found.  The  \\ater 
surface  elevation  at  \'erdugo  well  39&lt;^3-A  is  generall\- 
about  90  feet  higher  than  well  396.3,  which  is  located 
about  two-thirds  of  a  mile  downstream;  and  the  water 
levels  at  a  well  two-thirds  of  a  mile  farther  down- 
stream are  2.?0  feet  lower  yet. 

The  water-bearing  rocks  of  the  Los  Angeles  River 
Narrows  are  very  permeable.  The  City  of  Los  Angeles 
has  two  well  fields  in  the  area.  Because  of  heavy 
pumping,  large  depressions  have  been  created  in  the 
ground  \\ater  surface.  The  largest  of  these  pumping 
depressions  is  at  the  large  bend  in  the  Los  Angeles 
River  \\here  the  river  begins  its  southerly  course 
through  the  Narrows.  This  \\ell  field  and  nearby  wells 
immediatcK'  north  have  created  a  pumping  depression. 

The  historic  rise  of  water  at  the  lower  end  of  the 
upper  Los  Angeles  River  basin  is  due  in  part  to  the 
reduction  in  the  cross-sectional  area  as  the  stream  ap- 
proaches the  Los  Angeles  County  Flood  Control  Dis- 
trict F-57  gage.  The  maximum  depth  of  water-bearing 
rocks  near  Figucroa  Street  (Gage  F-57)  is  about  110 
feet,  whereas  the  maximum  depth  at  the  Pollock  well 
field  near  Fletcher  Boulevard  is  260  feet. 

Rising  water  has  licen  noted  in  the  past  in  the 
vicinity  of  Los  Feliz  Boulevard,  about  3.5  miles  up- 
stream from  the  primary  area  of  rising  w  ater.  This  was 
probably  due  in  part  to  a  constriction  or  reduction 
of  the  cross-sectional  area  of  water-bearing  rocks.  The 
constriction  is  caused  by  the  small  buried  hill  of  non- 
water-bearing  rock  just  downstream  from  Los  Feliz 
Boulevard. 

Movement  of  ground  ivater.  The  slope  of  the 
water  surface  and  direction  of  ground  water  move- 
ment in  the  unconfined  zones  of  the  San  Fernando 
hydrologic  subarca  is  generally  to  the  east  toward  the 
Los  Angeles  River  Narrow  s. 

The  ground  water  in  general  moves  away  from 
the  surrounding  hills  and  mountains  to  percolate  into 
the  permeable  portions  of  the  alluvial  fans. 

Syimar  Hydrologic  Subarea 

I'onnatioiis.  The  nonwater-bearing  rocks  that 
form  the  northern  boundary  of  the  subarea  are  com- 
posed essentially  of  Basement  Complex;  however,  in 
the  northwestern  portion  of  the  area,  rocks  of  the 
sedimentar\-  Repctto  Formation  arc  faulted  against  the 
Basement  Complex.  The  Repetto  Formation  also  oc- 
curs along  the  southeastern  boundary  and  again  in 


the  Mission  Hills,  where  it  is  overlain  by  a  thin  section 
of  nonwater-bearing  Pico  Formation. 

The  water-bearing  deposits  in  the  S\lmar  subarea 
consist  of  the  Saugus  Formation,  older  (Pleistocene) 
alluvium,  and  Holocene  alluvium.  The  Saugus  For- 
mation is  about  6400  feet  thick  and  is  composed  of 
strata  tiiat  vary  grcatl&gt;-  in  permcabilit\-.  Some  members 
of  the  formation  make  good  aquifers  while  others  are 
aquitards.  Tiie  older  alluvium  may  be  a  maximum  of 
300  to  500  feet  thick  west  of  the  X'eterans  Adminis- 
tration Hospital,  in  the  northeastern  portion  of  the 
subarea.  These  materials  are  composed  of  coarse  detri- 
tus derived  from  the  Basement  Complex;  however,  in 
some  places  residual  cla&gt;-  has  developed  as  a  result 
of  \\ eathering.  The  Holocene  alluxium  attains  a  thick- 
ness of  50  to  60  feet  in  Pacoima  Wash  where  the 
erosive  action  of  the  stream  has  incised  the  water- 
bearing units  and  then  backfilled  the  eroded  area  ■with 
vcr\'  coarse  granitic  debris.  In  the  remainder  of  the 
subarea,  where  Holocene  alluvium  occurs,  it  consti- 
tutes onI\-  a  thin  veneer  on  top  of  Pleistocene  older 
alluvium  and  Saugus  Formation. 

Structure.  The  geology  of  the  S\lmar  subarea 
is  greatl\-  complicated  by  faulting  and  folding.  The 
nonwater-bearing  rocks  materials  to  tiic  north  of  the 
subarca  have  been  faulted  and  in  part  thrust  south- 
ward over  portions  of  the  water-bearing  Saugus  For- 
mation. The  compressive  forces  that  are  related  to  the 
thrust  faulting  are  also  related  to  the  formation  of  the 
Little  Tujunga  syncline,  the  most  important  structural 
feature  of  the  subarea.  At  least  6000  feet  of  Saugus 
Formation  and  an  even  greater  thickness  of  older  non- 
water-bearing sediments  have  been  folded  into  an 
as\-mctric  s_\ncline  with  the  north  limb  overturned. 
This  syncline  has  been  truncated  b\-  erosion  and  cov- 
ered by  a  veneer  of  Pleistocene  older  and  Holocene 
alluvium.  The  southeastern  boundary  of  the  subarea 
was  first  belic\ed  to  have  been  formed  onl\-  by  the 
steep,  north-dipping  beds  of  the  nonwater-bearing 
Repetto  Formation  that  is  part  of  the  same  synclinal 
structure.  Howcxer,  the  surface  breaks  accompan\ing 
the  Fcbruar\-  9  earthquake  show  quite  clearly  that  this 
boundar\'  of  the  subarea  is  a  fault. 

Field  investigation.  Within  the  section  between 
P'oothill  Boulevard  and  .Mission  Hills,  there  is  a  very 
marked  discordance  in  water  levels.  In  order  to  lo- 
cate more  accurately  the  break  in  the  water  surface, 
20  bucket  auger  holes  were  drilled  in  1959.  Nine  of 
the  20  holes  were  drilled  l)\-  the  Cit\'  of  San  Fer- 
nando, five  by  the  City  of  Los  .Angeles,  and  the  re- 
maining six  by  the  State  Water  Rights  Board.  Repre- 
sentatives of  the  Board  were  present  at  the  drilling  of 
all  holes  and  prepared  detailed  logs  of  each  boring. 
The  logs  from  the  drilling  program  were  used  to  con- 
struct a  peg  model  which  aided  the  anal\sis.  The 
boundary  of  the  subarca  was  delineated  on  the  basis 
of  water  levels  between  Syimar  notch  and  Pacoima 
notch.  The  anal\'sis  of  available  water  level  data,  data 
obtained  from  the  test  holes,  and  the  geolog\-  of  the 
area  as  determined  during  the  San  Fernando  Refer- 
ence Stud&gt;-  indicated  the  following: 

1.  Water  levels  northwest  of  the  break  in  the  water  $ur- 
foce  were  obout  50  feet  higher  thon  those  to  the  southeast 
of  the  break.

2.  Water  levels  northwejt  of  the  breok  were  considared 
to  be  related  to  the  eroded  ends  of  confined  aquifers  !n  the 
Sougus  Formation. 

3.  Water  levels  southeast  of  the  break  were  considered 
to  be  free  ground  water  levels  in  coarse  alluvial  deposits 
which  have  the  Pacoima  drainage  os  a  source  area. 

4.  The  discordance  in  water  levels  is  related  fo  the 
eroded  south  flank  of  the  Little  Tujunga  syncline  which  has 
been  covered  with  a  thin  veneer  of  alluvium. 

5.  Subsurface  flow  from  the  Sylmor  subarea  to  the  San 
Fernando  subarea  hos  been  found  only  ot  two  places;  namely, 
the  Sylmar  ond  Pacoima  Notches.  There  is  hydraulic  continuity 
between  the  conflned  aquifers  and  the  veneer  of  alluvium 
thot  overlies  the  eroded  south  flank  of  the  Little  Tujunga  syn- 
cline. 

6.  Continuity  exists  between  the  Sylmar  and  San  Fer- 
nando subarea  through  the  saturated  alluvium  in  the  two 
notches. 

7.  The  configuration  of  the  break  in  water  surface 
through  the  Sylmar  and  Pacoima  Notches  was  considered  os 
not  being  sharp  enough  to  be  caused  by  a  fault  but  wos  still 
a  steep  gradient. 

Tliese  conclusions  were  subsequent!)-  modified  b&gt;- 
the  occurrence  of  the  zone  of  ground  rupture  related 
to  the  February  9,  1971,  earthquake,  indicating  that 
faulting  \\as  involved. 

Occiirreucc  and  inovcvient  of  grotmd  ivater.  The 
information  obtained  from  the  test  holes  drilled  in 
1959  greatl\-  aided  the  understanding  of  the  occurrence 
and  movement  of  ground  water  within  the  subarea. 
The  noticeable  pressure  rise  of  the  water  surface 
which  took  place  in  several  of  the  test  holes  during 
and  immediatel)'  after  drilling,  coupled  with  the  fact 
that  there  arc  historic  records  of  artesian  flows  for  the 
.Mission  well  field  and  the  City  of  San  Fernando  well 
field,  indicate  that  a  confined  water  system  exists 
within  the  Sylmar  subarea.  The  test  drilling  indicated 
that  a  free  ground  water  area  of  limited  size  is  present 
between  the  two  well  fields.  .\11  wells  in  the  subarea 
derive  their  water  supplies  from  the  confined  aquifers 
of  the  Saugus  Formation.  In  12  of  the  20  test  holes, 
Saugus  Formation  was  encountered  and  partially  pene- 
trated before  saturated  materials  were  reached. 

There  is  a  decline  in  water  level  in  the  free 
ground  water  area  in  the  Sylmar  subarea  coincident 
with  heavy  pumping  of  the  Alission  well  field.  There- 
fore, on  the  basis  of  the  period  of  record  available,  it 
is  concluded  that  the  free  ground  water  area  is  in 
hydraulic  continuity  \\  ith  the  confined  aquifer. 

The  Sylmar  and  Pacoima  Notches  are  the  prin- 
cipal areas  of  subsurface  escape  from  the  subarea.  The 
slope  of  the  ground  water  surface  through  the  S\lmar 
Notch  suggests  that  sniall  c]uantities  of  w  ater  are  flow- 
ing over  a  relati\el\-  impermeable  lip  or  harrier.  Data 
on  the  slope  of  the  ground  water  surface  through  the 
Pacoima  Notch  are  not  available. 

The  e.\act  location  and  extent  of  the  forebay  or 
recharge  area  for  the  confined  aquifers  are  not  defin- 
itelv  known;  however,  the  permeable  alluvial  deposits 
in  Pacoima  \A'asli  are  in  a  favorable  position  to  re- 
charge the  dipping  aquifers  of  the  Saugus  Formation 
that  are  in  contact  w  ith  the  stream  gravels  in  the  in- 
cised and  backfilled  portion  of  Pacoima  Wash.  Tiiesc 
permeable  deposits  act  as  a  sponge,  holding  water  for 
release  into  the  aquifers  of  the  Saugus  Formation. 
Ground  water  contours  indicate  that  there  is  a  down- 


ward slope  of  the  w  ater  surface  from  Pacoima  Wash 
toward  the  lower  portion  of  the  subarea  where  the 
majority  of  extractions  are  made.  Routing  studies  made 
by  the  staff  of  the  Water  Rights  Board  on  the  Sylmar 
subarea  indicate  that  the  water  suppl&gt;'  from  Pacoima 
Creek  that  could  remain  in  the  water-bearing  mate- 
rials above  the  Pacoima  submerged  dam  would  not  be 
sufficient  to  maintain  the  water  levels  in  the  area 
through  a  normal  period  of  w et  and  dry  \ears.  Deep 
percolation  of  precipitation  and  applied  water  and  of 
runoff  from  iiill  and  mountain  areas  are  also  major 
sources  of  recharge.  Such  recharge  is  believed  to  per- 
colate through  the  alluvial  blanket  and  enter  some  of 
the  truncated  aquifers  of  the  Saugus  Formation. 

The  hydraulic  gradient  under  static  conditions  in- 
dicates that  it  is  improbable  that  Lower  \'an  Norman 
Reservoir  has  contributed  w  ater  to  the  subarea  in  the 
past.  Records  of  well  4830,  about  2,000  feet  east  of 
the  reservoir,  show  that  water  levels  have  dropped 
below  elevation  1,120  feet  (high  water  surface  of 
Lower  \'an  Norman  Reservoir)  onl\-  six  times  between 
1932  and  1954.  Under  pumping  conditions,  the  water 
levels  are  lowered  about  90  feet  and  a  favorable  gradi- 
ent toward  the  well  could  be  developed  in  various 
aquifers  between  the  .Mission  w  ell  field  and  the  Lower 
\'an  Norman  Reservoir.  However,  the  available  in- 
formation is  insufficient  to  support  a  conclusion  that 
flow  occurred  while  the  well  was  being  pumped. 

It  is  possible  that  ground  water  can  move  west- 
ward in  the  Saugus  Formation  from  the  vicinitv'  of 
Kagcl  and  Lopez  Can\()ns  which  lie  immediately  to 
the  east  of  Pacoima  ^Vash,  since  a  favorable  h\draulic 
gradient  exists  and  the  synclinal  structure  of  the 
Saugus  Formation  plunges  westward.  The  amount  of 
water  that  could  be  derived  from  the  Kagcl-Lopez 
area  would  be  relatively  small  since  the  area  of  tribu- 
tary drainage  adjacent  to  the  permeable  formation 
is  small.  Wells  located  in  the  upper  Kagel  Canyon  area, 
penetrated  approximately  900  feet  of  the  Saugus  For- 
mation. Since  the  yields  of  these  wells  are  ver_\-  poor 
and  water  le\els  are  declining,  it  ma&gt;'  be  inferred  that 
ground  water  is  being  mined. 

Since  the  recharge  from  the  Pacoima  W'ash  area, 
coupled  with  deep  percolation  of  precipitation  and 
delivered  water  on  the  remaining  surface  of  the  sub- 
area,  appears  to  have  been  of  sufficient  magnitude  to 
maintain  water  levels  at  their  historic  levels,  historic 
recharge  from  Lower  \'an  Norman  Reservoir  or 
Kagel  and  Lopez  Canyons  is  improbable. 

A\'ater  level  fluctuations  within  the  eastern  por- 
tion of  the  S&gt;lmar  subarea  are  represented  b\'  hydro- 
graphs  of  wells  5939  and  5969,  which  are  shown  on 
figure  4.  Water  levels  in  the  lower  portion  of  the 
subarea  have  declined  about  80  feet  below  the  1944-4^ 
high-water  levels. 

Verdugo  Hydrologic  Subarea 

The  w  atcr-hearing  materials  of  the  \'crdugo  sub- 
area  are  surrounded  b\'  a  complex  of  granitic  and 
mctamorphic  rocks  w  hich  have  been  highl\-  fractured. 
.Miller  (1934)  mapped  the  rocks  in  two  main  groups, 
the  \\'ilson  Diorite  and  the  San  Gabriel  Formation. 
The  Ba.sement  Complex  yields  only  small  amounts 
of  water  to  springs  and  tunnels  from  fracture  systems

w  liicli  in  turn  :irc  supplicil  !)&gt;•  infiltration  of  precipita- 
tion. The  over-all  average  flow  from  each  of  these 
tunnels  and  springs  has  been  estimated  to  be  about 
20  gpm. 

The  valley  fill  is  composed  essentiall)'  of  coarse 
detritus  that  has  been  deposited  in  a  series  of  coalesc- 
ing fans.  The  principal  source  area  has  been  the  San 
Gabriel  .Mountains.  \\'cll  logs  indicate  a  fairly  high 
content  of  sand,  gra\cl,  and  boulders,  as  well  as  con- 
siderable cla\'  in  the  matrix  of  sonic  of  these  materials. 
Since  material  in  the  area  north  of  I'oothill  Boulevard 
has  a  lower  specific  \icld,  wells  in  tiiis  portion  of  the 
basin  have  mucii  lower  production  than  wells  lower  in 
the  valley. 

.\  series  of  cross-sections  and  bedrock  contours 
draw  n  through  the  subarca  indicate  that  the  elevation 
of  bedrock  decreases  toward  the  soutiieast  in  the  La 
Canada-Pickcns  Can\()n  area  and  that  a  buried 
ancestral  Pickens  A\'ash  slopes  soutiiwcst.  Available 
ground  water  level  measurements  indicate  that  tiic 
ridge  obstructs  the  flow  of  ground  water  from  the 
northeast  to  the  V'erdugo  subarea  under  low  w'ater- 
table  conditions  such  as  those  of  the  fall  of  1958;  how- 
ever, the  water  was  above  the  ridge  in  such  high 
water-table  years  as  1944. 

Geologic  studies  do  not  indicate  that  there  are 
an\-  sources  of  ground  water  entering  the  \'erdugo 
subarca  from  outside  the  watershed  along  faults  or 
fracture  systems. 

Direction  of  ground  tuater  movement.  The 
ground  water  in  the  Verdugo  subarea  moves  south- 
ward from  the  mouths  of  canyons  in  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  toward  \^erdugo  Canyon. 

Water  level  fluctuations  within  the  Verdugo  sub- 
arca are  represented  by  the  hydrograph  in  figure  5. 

Eagle  Rock  Hydrologic  Subarea 

The  Eagle  Rock  subarea  is  in  the  eastern  portion 
of  the  Los  Angeles  River  drainage  basin  adjacent  to 
the  Los  Angeles  River  Narrows.  The  surface  drainage 
flows  generall\-  towards  the  vicinity  of  Eagle  Rock 
Boulevard,  then  southwest  to  the  Los  Angeles  River. 
The  total  tributary  drainage  of  the  area  abo\c  the 
Ra\iiiond  fault  and  its  intersection  with  Eagle  Rock 
Boulevard  is  about  2910  acres. 

The  subarea  is  an  artesian  basin  in  which  all  pres- 
cnt-da\-  pumping  is  at  the  lower  end  of  the  pressure 
area. 

Formations.  Topanga  and  Pucnte  (Modelo) 
Formations  arc  the  principal  nonwater-bearing  rock 
units  cropping  out  in  the  area  surrounding  the  water- 
bearing rocks,  although  highh'  fractured  Basement 
Complex  is  present  in  the  hill  area  to  the  north. 

The  water-bearing  materials  are  composed  essen- 
tially of  older  alluvial  deposits  (Pleistocene)  of  sand, 
gravel,  and  considerable  cla\'.  Holocene  alluvium  con- 
stitutes onl\-  a  thin  veneer  along  the  stream  channels. 

The  Eagle  Rock  and  Raymond  faults  arc  the  main 
fault  features  of  the  area.  The  Eagle  Rock  fault  sepa- 
rates the  Basement  Complex  to  the  north  from  the 
Topanga  Formation  to  the  south  and  is  a  vertical  or 
high-angle   reverse  fault  with  vertical  movement  of 


several  hundred  feet.  Xo  alluvium  has  been  displaced 
by  the  Eagle  Rock  fault  (U'cldon.  1955). 

The  Raymond  fault  separates  the  Topanga  forma- 
tion in  the  northern  upthrown  block  from  the  Puente 
Formation  in  the  south  block.  The  trace  of  the  fault 
is  concealed  by  the  older  alluvium  along  York  Boule- 
vard, bur  an  approximate  location  is  indicated  by  out- 
crops near  tiic  fault  /one.  There  is  no  surface  indica- 
tion tiiat  nio\cmcnt  on  the  Raymond  fault  has  affected 
the  older  alhnium;  iiowe\cr,  some  movement  must 
have  occurred  prior  to  the  deposition  of  the  gravell_\- 
aquifer  materials  to  cause  the  change  from  the  essen- 
tially fine-grained  materials  of  the  low  cr  aquitard.  It  is 
quite  probable  that  traces  of  such  movement  have  been 
buried  during  the  deposition  of  the  upper  aquitard 
material. 

Occurrence  and  vwvemein  of  ground  ii-ater.  A 
detailed  study  of  well  logs,  water  level  data,  and  geol- 
og\'  has  led  to  the  conclusion  that  a  simple  artesian 
basin  exists  in  the  Eagle  Rock  subarea.  The  lower  end 
of  the  aquifer  abuts  against  the  Ra\mond  fault  and 
the  nonwater-bearing  Puente  Formation.  The  pressure 
area  extends  northward  toward  Colorado  Boulevard. 

Because  of  a  lack  of  data  in  the  upper  portion 
of  the  pressure  area  and  in  the  forebay,  an  accurate 
determination  of  the  extent  of  the  pressure  area  cannot 
be  made  at  this  time.  However,  it  is  estimated  that  the 
pressure  area  has  an  area  of  approximatel\-  250  acres 
and  the  foreba&gt;-  has  an  area  of  about  5.^0  acres.  Based 
on  a  pressure  area  of  250  acres,  a  thickness  of  10  feet, 
and  a  specific  yield  of  19  percent  the  storage  in  the 
pressure  aquifer  is  estimated  to  be  475  acre-feet.  All 
wells  located  within  the  assumed  pressure  area  have 
had  a  record  of  artesian  flows. 

Study  of  the  L^.S.  Department  of  Agriculture 
Soil  Surve\-  of  the  Los  .\ngcles  area,  California,  1919, 
indicates  a  long,  narrow  area  of  Chino  cla\'  loam  ex- 
tending northward  in  the  vicinity  of  Eagle  Rock 
Boulevard.  This  soil  probabl\'  supported  both  phreato- 
phytes  and  hydrophytes.  The  water  to  sustain  the 
plants  would  represent  the  overflow  from  a  full  pres- 
sure aquifer.  If  the  aquifer  were  full  and  had  no  addi- 
tional capacir\-  for  storing  water,  additional  water 
flowing  into  the  foreba\'  would  remain  outside  the 
confining  la&gt;cr  or  aquitard.  \\'ithdrawal  of  \\ ater  from 
the  confined  aquifer  would  create  available  storage. 

The  Eagle  Rock  artesian  system  is  supplied  ^ith 
water  by  percolation  of  runoff  and  of  applied  irriga- 
tion water. 

Direction  of  ground  ii-atcr  mova)ient.  Ground 
water  in  the  Eagle  Rock  subarea  moves  southward. 
There  is  no  known  subsurface  escape  of  ground  water 
from  the  pressure  aquifer.  The  Raymond  fault  appears 
to  be  an  effective  barrier  to  ground  water  movement 
in  this  subarea. 

SAN  FERNANDO  EARTHQUAKE 

The  follow  ing  discussion  concerns  the  relationship 
betw  een  the  surface  faulting  that  occurred  as  a  result 
of  the  February  9,  1971,  San  Fernando  earthquake  and 
( 1 )  the  previousl&gt;-  discussed  boundary  between  the 
Sylmar  and  San  Fernando  subareas  and  (2)  the  per- 
formance of  certain  water  wells  in  the  vicinitx'  of  S;in 
Fernando  during  and  after  the  earthquake.

A  discordance  in  the  ground  water  surface  was 
noted  in  the  area  northeast  of  the  city  of  San  Fer- 
nando during  previous  ground  water  investigations. 
As  stated,  a  scries  of  20  Inicket-auger  holes  was  drilled 
to  supplement  the  available  water-\vell  data.  The  line 
representing  the  break  in  \\ater  surface,  which  was 
originalK-  used  as  the  boundars-  between  the  Sylmar 
and  San  Fernando  subareas,  closcl\-  fits  tlie  surface 
faulting  in  tiie  Alission  Weils  segment  and  approxi- 
mates the  faulting  in  the  S\'lmar  segment  of  the  1971 
San  Fernando  fault.  The  gap  between  the  two  fault 
segments  was  the  area  most  intensively  explored  witii 
bucket-auger  borings  and  the  break  in  water  surface 
was  most  accurately  determined.  It  is  suggested  that, 
in  tills  area,  the  break  in  water  surface  be  used  as  the 
inferred  location  of  the  missing  fault  trace  (see  figure 
6).  The  greatest  deviation  between  the  trace  of  sur- 
face faulting  and  the  line  originally  mapped  occurs 
in  the  vicinity  of  Foothill  Boulevard.  However,  in  that 
area,  water  level  data  Mere  lacking,  and  the  break  was 
located  only  by  geologic  judgment  based  on  outcrops 
of  nonwater-bearing  formations  located  farther  to  the 
east  near  Pacoima  Wash. 

The  position  of  the  ground  water  surface  within 
the  Sylmar  subarea  has  been  studied  to  determine  if  a 
relationship  exists  between  the  depth  to  water  and 
drainage  from  single-famil\-  wood-frame  dwellings  and 
breaks  in  utilit\-  lines.  No  such  relationship  was  found. 
The  Saugus  Formation  and  older  alluvium  contain 
both  confined  and  semiconfincd  ground  water.  Some 
unconfincd  ground  \\atcr  occurs  in  the  Holocene  al- 
luvial deposits  of  Pacoima  Wash  and  several  other 
small  stream  channels.  The  S\lmar  subarea  is  readily 
divisible  into  two  parts:  an  eastern  portion,  which  con- 
tains the  majority  of  active  wells,  and  a  western  por- 
tion, which  contains  the  \'an  Norman  Reservoirs  and 
almost  no  active  wells.  The  eastern  portion  is  separated 
from  the  western  portion  b\-  a  topographic  divide 
that  extends  north\vard  from  tiie  northernmost  tip  of 
the  .Mission  Hills  (in  the  vicinity  of  the  Los  Angeles 
Department  of  Water  and  Power  Olive  Switching  Sta- 
tion) to  a  point  on  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains  near 
Foothill  Boulevard.  The  general  direction  of  ground 
water  movement  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the  subarea 
is  from  tiie  vicinit_\'  of  Pacoima  \\'ash  soutinwestward 
toward  the  water  wells  of  the  Cit\'  of  San  Fernando 
and  of  the  City  of  Los  ."Xngeles.  Some  ground  \\ater 
moves  from  tlie  direction  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains on  the  north  toward  the  same  well  fields.  The 
ground  ^\■ater  levels  in  the  eastern  portion  of  the  S)-I- 
mar  subarea  gcncralK'  declined  from  the  Iiistoric  highs 
in  the  early  and  mid  1940s  due  to  ground  water  \\itli- 
draw  als  b\-  tiie  Cit\-  of  San  Fernando  and  tlic  Cit\-  of 
Los  Angeles  Mission  well  fields. 

The  direction  of  ground  water  movement  within 
the  western  portion  is  toward  Upper  \'an  Norman 
Reservoir.  The  general  direction  of  movement  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  Juvenile  Hall  is  from  northeast  to 
southwest. 

Prior  to  the  construction  of  Lower  San  Fernando 
Dam  in  19L^,  the  stream  deposits  in  the  channel  sec- 
tion provided  an  avenue  for  the  exit  of  subsurface 
water  from  tiic  western  part  of  tiie  S\Imar  subarea. 


Since  the  completion  of  Lower  Van  Norman  Reser- 
voir in  1918  and  Upper  Van  Norman  Reservoir  in 
1921,  the  naturall\-  occurring  subsurface  outflow  has 
been  cut  off  for  all  practical  purposes. 

Ground  water  recharge  to  the  Sylmar  subarea  is 
accomplished  by  the  percolation  of  rainfall  and  run- 
off from  the  various  tributary  canyons,  as  well  as 
the  percolation  of  applied  Owens  River  water.  The 
major  portion  of  land  area  within  the  Sylmar  Basin 
lies  within  the  corporate  limits  of  the  City  of  Los 
,\ngeles.  The  water  supply  for  the  Cit\-  of  Los 
.•\ngeles,  S\'lmar  District,  is  obtained  from  the  Owens 
River  .\i]ueduct.  All  of  the  pumpage  from  the  City 
of  Los  .\ngeles  .Mission  well  field  is  exported  from  the 
S\'lmar  subarea  to  the  San  Fernando  subarea. 

Approximately  three-quarters  of  the  land  area  of 
tlie  city  of  San  Fernando's  total  of  2.3  square  miles  lies 
(Jutside  of  the  S\lmar  subarea,  \et  all  of  the  city's 
water  supply  prior  to  the  earthquake  was  obtained 
from  wells  in  the  Sylmar  subarea.  Water  levels  in  the 
eastern  portion  have  declined  because  pumpage  has 
exceeded  the  recharge  from  natural  and  imported 
sources.  Historically,  two  areas  of  ground  water  close 
to  the  ground  surface  have  been  reported  in  the  Syl- 
mar subarea.  These  areas  were  described  in  testimony 
of  the  Btirr  vs.  Maclny  litigation  (see  section  on  "Brief 
liistor\-  of  litigation,  this  chapter)  as  being  the  East 
and  AV'est  Cicncgas.  The  175-acre  East  Cienega,  some- 
times referred  to  as  the  Porter  Cienega,  was  the  larg- 
est. It  extended  from  the  .Mission  Hills  in  the  vicinitv 
of  the  present-day  Mission  well  field  to  the  City  of  San 
Fernando  w  ells  located  near  Fourth  Street  and  Hub- 
bard .Avenue.  AVells  drilled  in  this  area  before  the 
turn  of  the  centur\-  were  artesian. 

The  80-acre  \\'estern  Cienega  was  located  north- 
cast  of  the  northeast  arm  of  Lower  \'an  Norman 
Reservoir.  Prior  to  the  construction  of  the  freewa&gt;", 
and  during  times  of  high  \\  ater  levels  in  the  reservoir, 
a  small  seepage  pond  was  formed  east  of  Sepulveda 
Boulevard.  The  seepage  pond  was  covered  by  a  large 
fill  for  the  Golden  State  Freewa&gt;'.  The  earthquake 
damage  to  the  freeway  in  that  location  may  be  di- 
rectl\-  related  to  this  earlier  history  of  near-surface 
ground  water. 

Rising  water  from  both  Cienegas  w  as  diverted  to 
.Mission  San  Fernando  for  domestic  and  irrigation  uses. 
These  diversions  constitute  the  earliest  reported  hy- 
draulic works  in  the  northern  portion  of  the  San  Fer- 
nando \'alle&gt;'.  The  areal  extent  of  the  old  Cienegas 
was  \erified  by  detailed  pedological  surveys.  High 
calcium  carbonate  and  high  organic  carbon  contents 
were  used  to  delineate  former  areas  of  near-surface 
ground  water. 

.■\  third  area  of  near-surface  ground  water  was 
ilclincarcd  during  the  investigation  of  ground  displace- 
ment at  San  I'ernando  \'alle\'  Juvenile  Hall,  conducted 
1)\-  Fugro,  Inc.  Borings  made  after  the  February  9, 
1971,  earthquake  revealed  the  presence  of  ground 
water  at  depths  ranging  from  6  to  30  feet  below- 
ground  surface  in  the  area  of  ground  rupture.  The 
materials  containing  the  near-surface  ground  water  arc 
overlain  by  soils  cemented  by  calcium  carbonate. 
These  soils  arc  similar  to  those  found  in  the  East  and 
West  Cienegas.  It  is  quite  evident  that  the  near-surface

ground  water  contributed  to  ground  rupturing  at  the 
Juvenile  Hall  facility  and  in  the  open  field  area  im- 
mediately to  the  south.  Damage  to  some  of  the  fills  for 
the  Jensen  Filtration  plant  may  also  be  related  to  the 
near-surface  ground  water  around  Upper  Van 
Norman  Reservoir. 

Performance  of  Water  Wells 

There  arc  records  and  data  on  more  than  400 
water  wells  in  the  upper  Los  Angeles  drainage  basin. 
About  190  of  the  w  ells  are  owned  by  the  City  of  Los 
Angeles.  The  remaining  wells  are  those  belonging  to 
the  200+  defendants  in  the  case  City  of  Los  Angeles 
vs.  City  of  SiV!  Fernando  et  al.  or  their  successors.  The 
Cities  of  Los  Angeles,  Glcndale,  and  Burbank  are  the 
largest  pumpers  of  ground  water.  A  recently  con- 
ducted survey  of  the  water-well  owners  indicates  that 
the  only  water  wells  that  suffered  any  noticeable 
damage  during  the  February  9,  1971,  earthquake  were 
those  belonging  to  the  City  of  San  Fernando.  As  a 
result  of  earthquake  damage  to  the  City  of  San 
Fernando  well  No.  7,  and  the  high  bacteria  content  in 
other  City  wells,  the  City  of  San  Fernando  extracted 
1526.06  acre-feet  less  than  their  legally  allotted  amount 
of  2,737  acre-feet  during  the  1971  water  year  ending 
September  30,  1971.  Emergency'  connections  with  the 
Metropolitan  Water  District  feeder  lines  allowed  the 
City  of  San  Fernando  to  continue  limited  water  dis- 
tribution. As  a  result  of  the  decreased  pumping  in  the 
Sylmar  subarea,  ground  water  levels  have  risen. 

Ground  Water  Level  Fluctuations 

The  effects  of  ground  shaking  caused  by  the  San 
Fernando    earthquake    were    recorded    on    numerous 


continuous  water-level  recorders  in  southern  Califor- 
nia. Well  no.  4915,  located  in  the  Consolidated  Rock 
Products  Sun  Valley  pit  below  Hansen  Dam,  is  the 
closest  well  to  the  S\lmar  area  that  \\as  equipped  with 
a  continuous  water-level  recorder.  This  well,  3  miles 
south  of  the  ground  rupture  along  the  Tujunga  seg- 
ment of  the  San  Fernando  fault,  recorded  a  deflection 
of  about  0.5  foot  in  the  water  surface  during  the  earth- 
quake. The  water  surface  returned  to  its  original  level 
immediately  after  the  main  shock.  Interpretation  of 
the  recorder  chart  and  other  well  measurements  by 
personnel  at  the  Cit&gt;-  of  Los  Angeles  Department  of 
\\'ater  and  Pow  cr  indicates  that  there  were  no  perma- 
nent changes  in  ground  water  elevations  directly  at- 
tributable to  the  February  9,  1971,  earthquake.  The 
short-term  water-level  fluctuation  within  recorder 
well  4915  was  attributed  to  ground  shaking  and  vibra- 
tion of  the  well  structure  itself.  The  Cities  of  Glendale 
and  Burbank  indicated  that  there  were  no  earthquake- 
induced  eff'ects  noted  in  any  of  their  water  wells. 

Proctor  et  al.  ( 1972)  of  Aletropolitan  Water  District 
suggest  that,  in  general,  water  levels  in  observation 
holes  north  of  the  surface  rupturing  rose  abruptly, 
then  slowly  subsided  to  near  their  original  position. 
The  two  tables  of  measurements  presented  in  the 
Proctor  paper  suggest  that  no  clear-cut  relationship 
exists  between  the  pre-  and  post-quake  measurements. 
Some  of  the  differences  are  of  such  small  magnitude 
that  one  might  suspect  differences  in  barometric  pres- 
sure as  the  cause.  Other  measurements  that  indicate  a 
rise  may  be  related  to  normal  seasonal  fluctuations 
such  as  are  illustrated  on  the  hydrographs  of  wells  5939 
and  5969,  which  were  on  an  upward  trend  prior  to  the 
earthquake. 


CHAPTER  5 


Geology  of  the  Southeast  Slope  of  the  Sonta  Susano  Mountains  and 
Geologic  Effects  of  the  San  Fernando  Earthquake 


by  Richard  B.  Saul' 


ABSTRACT 

Sedimentary  rocks  of  Late  Tertiary  and  Quaternary 
age  exposed  at  the  north  edge  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley 
record  the  time,  scope,  and  duration  of  episodes  of  folding 
and  faulting  that  generated  the  present  landscape. 

In  the  southeast  quarter  of  the  Oat  Mountain  quad- 
rangle and  the  adjacent  part  of  the  San  Fernando  quad- 
rangle, west  of  the  San  Diego  Freeway,  there  are  three 
structural  provinces:  northern,  southern,  and  eastern.  The 
northern  province  is  comprised  of  rocks  and  structures  lying 
above  the  sole  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust;  the  southern 
province,  the  folded,  faulted,  and  eroded  rocks  underlying 
the  north  edge  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley;  and  the  east- 
ern province,  the  rocks  and  structures  involved  in  Late 
Quaternary  uplift  of  the  western  end  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains,  of  which  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  Feb- 
ruary 9,  1971,  was  an  episode. 

Most  of  the  surface  breaks  and  structural  damage 
were  confined  to  a  zone  along  the  trace  of  the  Santa 
Susana  thrust,  probably  as  a  result  of  local  amplification 
of  ground  shaking.  West  of  San  Fernando  Pass,  permanent 
ground  deformation  accompanying  the  earthquake  was 
distributed  along  favorably  oriented,  pre-existing  planes 
of  weakness. 

The  Santa  Susana  fault  probably  has  been  inactive 
since  the  middle  Pleistocene.  The  faults  most  active  during 
the  earthquake  are  not  relatable  to  it  in  time  or  space. 
The  Devonshire  and  Northridge  Hills  faults  have  been  sites 
of  Late  Quaternary  displacement. 

Mapping  in  detail  suggests  that  further  refinement  of 
some  local  stratigraphic  units  is  needed. 


This  report  is  based  on  detailed  geologic  mapping 
of  the  south  slope  of  the  Santa  Susana  Mountains,  in 
the  Oat  Mountain  and  San  Fernando  quadrangles.  The 
mapped  area  extends  eastward  from  Limekiln  Can- 
yon *  to  San  Fernando  Pass,  southward  from  San 
Fernando  Pass  to  the  Mission  Hills,  and  to  the  east 
shore  of  the  Van  Norman  Reservoirs.  It  was  studied 
originally  by  W.  S.  W.  Kew  (1924). 

Subsequent  exploration  for  oil  in  this  area  led  to 
discovery  of  four  fields,  two  of  which  continue  to 
yield  oil  (Leach,  1948).  The  largest  producing  field, 
Aliso  Canyon,  is  described  by  Hazzard  (1944)  and 
Hanson  and  Saunders  (1962);  the  other  field,  Cascade, 
is  described  by  Roth  and  Sullwold  (1962).  The  two

east  edge  of  the  San  Fernando  quadrangle. 


smaller,  inactive  fields  are  Horse  Meadows,  described 
by  Stewart  (1962)  and  Cordova  (1965),  and  Mission, 
described  by  Cassell  and  Sanem  (1962). 

Following  Kew's  work,  the  principal  published 
reports  on  the  area  are  those  of  Oakeshott  (1958), 
who  mapped  the  area  now  covered  by  the  San  Fer- 
nando, Sunland,  Mint  Canyon  and  Agua  Dulce  7'/:' 
quadrangles;  Winterer  and  Durham  (1962),  who 
mapped  west  of  San  Fernando  Pass;  and  Jennings  and 
Strand  (1969),  who  compiled  the  regional  geology 
on  the  Los  Angeles  Sheet  of  the  Geologic  Atlas  of 
California  (see  plate  1,  this  Bulletin). 

Important  unpublished  theses  are  those  by  Bishop 
(1950),  who  mapped  from  Limekiln  Canyon  west  to 
the  Los  Angeles- Ventura  County  line;  Jennings  (1957), 
who  worked  from  Limekiln  Canyon  east  to  San  Fer- 
nando Pass;  and  Merifield  (1958),  who  mapped  from 
the  San  Fernando  Pass  area  eastward  along  the  front 
of  the  western  San  Gabriel  Mountains. 

The  work  for  this  report  ^\'as  funded,  in  part, 
through  a  cooperative  project  with  the  Los  Angeles 
County  Engineer  and  the  Los  ,\ngeles  County  Flood 
Control  District.  In  addition  tiic  author  is  indebted  to 
S.  H.  Aiayeda,  William  Davis,  and  John  Weldon,  engi- 
neering geologists  with  the  Los  Angeles  Department  of 
Water  and  Power,  and  to  Union  Oil  Company  for 
sharing  their  data  and  ideas. 

Although  the  effects  of  the  February  9,  1971, 
earthquake  were  sparse  in  this  area,  the  rocks,  the 
geologic  structure,  and  the  landscape  yield  abundant 
data  on  the  distribution,  sequence,  and  magnitude  of 
the  mountain-building  process,  of  which  the  earth- 
quake was  the  most  recent  episode.  Therefore,  geology 
is  stressed  in  this  report. 

STRATIGRAPHY 

Previous  workers  have  found  it  convenient  to 
group  the  rocks  exposed  in  this  area  into  two  prov- 
inces: a  southern  province,  comprised  of  the  rocks 
lying  south  of  and  beneath  the  Santa  Susana  thrust 
fault,  and  a  northern  province,  comprised  of  the  rocks 
in  and  above  the  thrust.  A  third  or  eastern  province, 
added  herein,  is  represented  by  the  Mission  Hills  and 
adjacent  terrain  (figure  1). 

Rocks  as  old  as  Late  Cretaceous  are  present  at 
depth  in  the  southern  and  nortliern  provinces.  In  the 
part  of  the  eastern  province  mapped  for  this  report, 
test  wells  have  penetrated  no  rocks  older  than  Mio- 
cene; however,  in  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  to  the 
east,  rocks  of  Precambrian  age  are  exposed.  Only  the 
rocks  exposed  at  the  surface  will  be  discussed  in  this 
report.

Figure  ^.  The  three  structural  provinces.  The  space  (B)  at  the  top  of  the  drawing  marks  what  may  be  a  border  zone  between  the  northern 
and  eastern  provinces.  If  it  exists,  this  zone  is  irregular  and  extends  at  least  as  far  south  as  the  axis  of  the  Mission  anticline.  Within  and  east 
of  the  zone,  the  east  end  of  the  northern  province  hos  become  incorporated  in  the  tectonically  active  eastern  province.  Folds  and  faults  in  both 
the  northern  and  southern  provinces  have  probably  undergone  continued  deformation  and  displacement  where  they  have  become  incorporated 
in, or  lie  adjacent  to, the  eastern  province. 


Northern  Province 

Topanga  Fonuat'ion.  East  of  Limekiln  Canyon, 
the  oldest  rocks  exposed  above  the  Santa  Susana  thrust 
arc  244  m  (800  feet)  of  interlayercd  arkosic  and  con- 
glomeratic sandstone,  shale,  and  silty  shale  of  the 
middle  .Miocene  Topanga  Formation  (Kew,  1924). 
The  area  of  outcrop  is  limited  to  an  erosional  basin 
athwart  the  axis  of  the  eastward-plunging  Oat  Moun- 
tain anticline  at  the  cast  end  of  .-Miso  Canyon  oil  field. 
The  base  of  the  formation  is  not  exposed  here.  At  the 
type  locality-  in  Topanga  Canyon,  the  contact  with 
the  overlying  Modelo  Formation  is  a  marked  angular 


unconformity  (Susuki,  19.f2).  At  .\liso  Canyon,  this 
contact  appears  to  be  conformable  and  is  drawn  arbi- 
trarily at  the  top  of  the  uppermost  sandstone  unit 
prominent  enough  to  include  in  the  dominantly  sandy 
Topanga  Formation. 

A  brief  description  of  the  Topanga  Formation  is 
as  follows,  from  the  top  down: 

About  30  m  (100  feet)  of  white  and  light  brown,  well- 
sorted.  Finegrained,  soft,  quartz-rich,  arkosic  sandstone  con- 
taining lenses  of  cobble  conglomerate  and,  to  the  west, 
Inlerbedded  siltstone.  The  contoct  with  the  overlying  Modelo 
Formation  is  paralleled  by  a  zone  of  fractured,  light  brown 
sandstone   9   to   12   m   (30   to   40   feel)   thick.

Approximately  121  m  (395  feet)  of  interbedded,  soft  gray 
to  dork  gray,  light  brown-weathering,  arkosic  siltstone,  sandy 
siltstone,  and  silty  sandstone.  A  few  resistant  carbonate- 
cemented  beds. 

A  shale  member  about  18  m  (60  feet)  thick  consisting 
of  brown  to  black,  light  gray  to  brown  weathering,  silty 
clay  shale  bearing  a  microfossil  fauna  of  the  ValyuUneria 
Californica  zone  (Luisian). 

A  basal  sandstone  member  with  an  exposed  thickness  of 
about  80  m  (260  feet)  composed  of  white  to  medium  gray, 
soft,  arkosic,  fine-grained  sandstone. 

Modelo  Formation.  Accurate  descriptions  of  the 
stratigraphy  of  the  upper  Miocene  Modelo  Formation 
(Eidridge  and  Arnold,  1907)  have  been  made  difficult 
by  large-scale  thrust  faulting  in  rocks  that  change 
facies  laterally.  Stratigraphically  equivalent  but  litho- 
logically  differing  rocks  are  juxtaposed  locally  in  fault- 
bounded  masses  stacked  up  along  the  trace  of  the 
Santa  Susana  fault  zone. 

A  rough  composite  section  includes  approximately 
1036  m  (3300  feet)  of  sediments  as  follows,  from  top 
down: 

An  upper  shale  member  roughly  153  m  (500  feet)  thick 
that  interfingers  with  the  overlying  Towsley  Formation.  It 
consists  of  block  to  gray,  brown-weathering  silty  sand  beds 
ranging  from  less  than  a  centimeter  to  as  much  as  10  m 
thick.  This  is  a  soft,  deeply  weathered  member  which  spalls 
and   stakes   in   fresh   exposures. 

A  sandstone  member,  275  m  (900  feet)  maximum  thick- 
ness, composed  of  light  gray  to  tan,  brown-weathering, 
generally  well-indurated,  fine-  to  coarse-grained,  arkosic 
sandstone  interbedded  with  subordinate  amounts  of  shaly 
sandstone  and  silty  shale.  Graded  beds  are  common;  coarser 
grained  sand  generally  is  at  the  base  of  such  beds  where 
load  costs  and  similar  turbidite  structures  ore  apt  to  be 
present. 

A  shale  member  183  m  (600  feet)  thick  ranging  in  com- 
position from  almost  pure  diatomite  through  gray,  silty, 
foraminiferol  shale  and  shaly  siltstone.  Where  best  exposed, 
in  one  of  the  lowest  thrust  wedges,  this  member  is  capped 
by  a  block  to  dark  brown,  silty,  clay  shale  unit  that  has 
lost  any  semblance  of  internal  order  or  sequence  to  pervasive 
shearing  during  transport  within  the  thrust  zone.  A  light 
gray  tuff  bed,  about  30  cm  (one  foot)  thick,  is  associated 
with  the   most  diotomaceous   part  of  this   member. 

A  member  about  240  m  (800  feet)  thick  consisting  of  white 
to  light  brown,  porcelaneous  shale  and  interbedded  black 
thinly  bedded  fissile  shale,  black  to  brown  silty  cloy  shale, 
and  silty  sandstone.  The  lower  third  of  this  member  is  domi- 
nontly  porcelaneous  shale;  the  upper  two-thirds  more  abun- 
dantly interbedded  with  the  softer,  less  silicic  beds.  Silty 
sandstone  beds  increase  in  abundance  and  thickness  toward 
the  top  of  the   member. 

A  150-meter-thick  (500  foot)  basal  member  characterized  by 
black-to-brown,  silty  cloy  shale  with  subordinate  amounts  of 
porcelaneous  shale  and  light  gray,  white-weathering,  limy 
concretions    and    concretionary    beds. 

Near  the  sole  of  the  thrust,  the  diotomaceous  shale  mem- 
ber lies  beneath  the  sandstone  member.  In  the  uppermost 
thrust  plate,  on  the  north  flank  of  the  Oot  Mountain  anticline, 
this  strotigrophic  interval  is  occupied  by  porcelaneous  and 
black-to-brown  silty  clay  shale  of  the  upper  port  of  the 
porcelaneous  shale   member. 

Toivsley  Formation.  The  upper  Miocene  to  lower 
Pliocene  Towsley  Formation  was  described  by  Wint- 
erer and  Durham  (1954)  as  being  characterized  by 
coarse-grained  rocks  deposited  by  turbidit&gt;'  currents 
in  deep   water.   Subsequently    (1962),   these  authors 


stated,  "The  lithology  and  thickness  of  the  Towsley 
Formation  change  markedly  from  place  to  place  so 
that  the  designation  of  a  section  truly  typical  of  the 
formation  as  a  whole  is  impossible."  As  with  the  un- 
derlying Modelo  Formation,  additional  stratigraphic 
confusion  is  found  in  the  zone  of  the  Santa  Susana 
thrust. 

Here  the  Towsley  Formation  is  exposed  through 
a  thickness  of  about  610  m  (2000  feet)  in  the  crest  of 
the  Oat  Mountain  anticline  and  as  a  partial  section  in 
a  large  thrust  block  at  the  mouth  of  Bee  Canyon.  The 
exposed  rocks  are  predominantly  hard,  light  gray, 
light-to  dark-brown-weathering,  fine-grained,  poorly 
sorted  sandstone  interbedded  with  silty,  gray,  brown- 
weathering  shale  and  siltstone.  The  sandstone  contains 
abundant  structures  and  stratification  commonly  as- 
cribed to  turbidites.  Some  beds  include  abundant, 
dark-brown-weathering  concretions.  Conglomerate, 
though  generally  subordinate,  is  relatively  more 
abundant  in  the  upper  half  of  the  section.  The  rocks 
in  the  fault  block  at  the  mouth  of  Bee  Canyon  appear 
to  be  part  of  the  lower  half  of  the  section. 

Fico  Formation.  Exposures  of  the  Pliocene  Pico 
Formation  (Kew,  1924)  are  confined  to  fault  blocks 
lying  between  Bee  Canyon  and  San  Fernando  Pass 
and  a  narrow  outcrop  above  the  Santa  Susana  thrust 
in  the  Pass.  The  base  of  the  formation  exposed  in  San 
Fernando  Pass  is  light-to  dark-brown-weathering  sand- 
stone and  conglomerate  of  varying  thickness  that  in- 
terfingers with  the  underlying,  less  conglomeratic 
Towsley  Formation.  In  the  fault  zone,  conglomerate, 
sandstone,  and  fossiliferous  sandstone  and  gray  silt- 
stone are  exposed.  The  contact  with  the  overlying 
Sunshine  Ranch  Member  of  the  Saugus  Formation  is 
in  an  overturned  syncline  in  the  Santa  Susana  fault 
zone  just  west  of  the  Pass. 

Snnshine  Ranch  Meinber  of  the  Saugiis  Formation. 
In  1958,  Oakeshott  quoted  J.  C.  Hazzard's  unpub- 
lished use  of  the  name  "Sunshine  Ranch  Formation," 
typically  exposed  in  the  vicinit\'  of  Van  Norman 
Reservoirs;  however,  Oakeshott  mapped  it  as  the  upper 
member  of  the  Pico  Formation.  Winterer  and  Durham 
(1962)  treated  the  Sunshine  Ranch  as  a  member  of  the 
Saugus  Formation.  In  this  report,  the  fossiliferous  beds 
at  the  base  of  Hazzard's  "formation"  are  placed  in 
the  Pico  Formation  (fossil-bearing  beds  higher  in  the 
section  alluded  to  by  Winterer  and  Durham  were  not 
found);  and  the  Sunshine  Ranch,  stripped  of  marine 
affinities,  was  mapped  as  a  member  of  the  Saugus 
Formation.  The  probable  Pliocene-lower-Pleistocene 
age  of  the  Saugus  Formation  is  discussed  by  Oakeshott 
(1958),  who  considers  the  Sunshine  Ranch  to  be  late 
Pliocene.  This  age  has  been  further  confirmed  by  the 
discovery  (March  1972)  of  a  horse  bone  and  teeth. 
C.  A.  Repenning  (U.S.  Geological  Survey)  found 
these  to  be  a  crushed  rostrum  bearing  the  incisors  and 
one  canine  and  an  isolated  left  upper  jaw  tooth, 
probably  a  first  molar,  belonging  to  a  middle  or  late 
Pliocene  species  of  Fliohippus.  The  field  locality 
(U.S.G.S.  NN  19-3)  is  on  the  north  edge  of  the  axial 
trench  of  the  proposed  new  dam  in  the  Van  Norman 
Reservoir  complex,  about  180  m  (600  feet)  below  the

top  of  the  Sunshine  Ranch   Member  of  the  Saugus 
Formation. 

Above  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  and  west  of  San 
Fernando  Pass,  an  incomplete  section  of  the  Sunshine 
Ranch  Member  of  the  Saugus  Formation  is  exposed 
in  a  fault  block  within  tiic  zone  of  the  tiirust  roughl\' 
244  m  (800  feet)  wide  and  4&lt;')0  m  (1500  feet)  long. 
Here  this  member  is  dominantl&gt;-  soft  gray  siltstonc 
with  a  few  thin  beds  of  characteristic  white  nodular 
limestone,  concretionary  gray,  coarse-grained,  poorly 
sorted  sandstone  beds  and  subordinate  amounts  of  light 
gray,  moderately  hard  conglomeratic  sandstone.  A 
complete  description  of  this  member  is  included  in 
the'  following  section  on  the  southern  province. 

Southern  Province 

Modclo  Formation.  The  onh-  exposures  of  the 
upper  Miocene  Modelo  Formation  in  this  province  arc 
rvvo  small  adjacent  bodies  bounded  by  faults,  lying 
within  the  zone  of  the  Dcvonsliire  fault  on  the  east 
side  of  Limekiln  Canyon.  These  arc  diatornaceous 
shale,  limy  concretionary  beds,  earthy  organic  shale 
impregnated  with  petroleum,  and  chert.  Subsurface 
data  (Stewart,  1962)  indicate  that  rocks  of  this  age 
lie  about  300  m  (1000  feet)  below  the  surface  at  this 
site  with  no  fault  evident  to  explain  tlieir  presence  at 
the  surface;  however,  these  rocks  appear  to  be  related 
to  a  thrust  block  of  similar  rocks  exposed  above  the 
sole  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  zone  between  Limekiln 
Canvon  and  Bull  Canyon.  The  nearest  outcrop  of  the 
body  is  about  2  km  (a  mile)  north-northeast,  where 
Limekiln  Canyon  cuts  the  thrust  at  the  north  edge  of 
Horse  Flats.  Microfossils  in  the  diatomite  of  the  two 
outcrop  areas  are  the  same  age  (Alohnian).  This  prob- 
lem will  be  discussed  further  in  the  section  on  struc- 
ture. 

?ico  Formation.  The  Pico  Formation  interfingers 
with  the  overlying  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  of  the 
Saugus  Formation.  As  previously  mentioned,  in  this 
work,  the  boundary  was  drawn  above  the  highest 
recognizable  marine  fossil  or  the  lateral  projection  of 
such  fossil-bearing  beds.  The  fossils  and  the  character 
of  the  fossil-bearing  rock  suggest  as  man&gt;'  as  three  dis- 
tinct near-shore  environments  from  outcrop  to  out- 
crop in  the  present  discontinuous  exposure.  It  is  prob- 
able that  the  mapped  boundary  does  not  represent  the 
same  stratigraphic  horizon  through  its  entire  length 
because  it  marks  a  zone  of  transition  that  was  once  a 
coast  line.  Furthermore,  the  position  of  the  present 
outcrop  in  relation  to  the  former  coastal  zone  is  un- 
known. 

In  this  province,  the  upper  part  of  the  Pico  For- 
mation is  exposed  in  the  faulted  and  eroded  axes  of 
the  Hadle&gt;-  and  Amission  anticlines.  In  these  exposures, 
it  is  generally  soft  to  moderately  firm,  white  to  light 
tan,  silty  to  coarse-grained,  locally  fossilifcrous  .sand- 
stone; bur,  in  an  outcrop  just  cast  of  Shoshone  Avenue, 
the  upper  contact  is  drawn  above  a  soft,  gray,  fossilif- 
crous siltstonc. 

The  exposures  of  the  Pico  Formation  in  the 
southern  province  represent  30  to  60  m  (100  to  200 
feet)  of  a  total  thickness  reported  (Cassell  and  Sanem, 
1962)  to  be  in  excess  of  610  m  (2000  feet)  in  wells 
drilled  for  petroleum. 


Sunshine  Ranch  Meviber  of  the  Saugus  Formation. 
The  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  is  comprised  of  about 
707  m  (2320  feet)  of  nonmarine  sediments  of  Plio- 
Plcistocene  age.  The  basal  60  to  90  m  (200  to  300 
feet)  is  dominantly  soft  light  brown-weathering  sand- 
stone and  conglomerate  with  siltstonc  and  interbedded 
claysrnnc.  The  upper  275  to  300  m  (900  to  1000  feet) 
arc  characterized  by  green-gray  claystone  and  gray 
siltstonc  interbedded  with  light  gray  to  light  brown 
sandstone  and  conglomerate.  Some  sandstone  beds  con- 
tain limy  concretions.  Cross-bedding  is  common  in 
tiie  coarser  sediments.  Local  unconformities  and  chan- 
nel-fill structures  are  common.  White  nodular  lime- 
stone ranging  from  thin  discontinuous  beds  to  solid 
layers  more  than  a  foot  thick  are  sparsely  distributed 
tlirough  the  silt  and  clay-rich  units.  In  the  upper  half 
of  the  member,  the  nodular  limestone  beds  become 
less  pure.  .\s  the  upper  contact  is  approached,  in- 
creasing amounts  of  enclosed  fine  sand  and  silt  change 
the  color  of  the  limestone-rich  beds  from  white  to 
shades  of  gray. 

The  contact  bet\\een  the  Sunshine  Ranch  Mem- 
ber and  tiie  overlying  upper  part  of  the  Saugus  For- 
mation is  drawn  at  the  base  of  a  bluff-forming  sandy 
conglomerate.  Along  the  northeast  flank  of  the  Mis- 
sion anticline,  there  is  a  slight  angular  unconformit&gt;' 
at  this  contact. 

Upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation.  The  lower- 
to-middlc  Pleistocene  upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Forma- 
tion is  comprised  of  about  488  m  (1600  feet)  of  dom- 
inantK"  coarse-grained,  nonmarine  sedimentary  rocks. 
Some  siltstonc  beds  resemble  those  in  the  Sunshine 
Ranch  .Member;  bur,  in  general,  the  finer  grained  beds 
of  this  unit  are  tan  or  brown,  and  clay-sized  material 
is  less  abundant.  Cliannel  and  fill  strucuires  and  cross- 
bedding  are  common.  Some  channel  gravels  are 
densely  cemented  by  calcium  carbonate.  In  the  upper 
half  of  this  sequence,  rounded  siltstonc  pebbles  be- 
come common,  suggesting  reworking  from  some  not- 
too-distant  uplifted  area.  In  the  upper  third  of  the 
upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation,  tan-  and  brown- 
weathering  siltstonc  is  dominant. 

Throughout  the  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  and  in 
all  but  the  uppermost  10  to  15  percent  of  the  upper 
part  of  the  Saugus  Formation,  the  pebbles  and  cobbles 
in  the  coarse  units  consist  predominantly  of  igneous 
and  metamorphic  rock  types.  .\t  present,  these  rock 
t\pes  arc  exposed  on  the  north  slope  of  the  San  Gabriel 
.Mountains  and  in  .Mint  and  Soicdad  Canyons  northeast 
as  far  as  the  edge  of  tiie  Mojavc  Desert.  Some  60  to 
90  m  (200  to  300  feet)  below  the  top  of  the  Saugus 
Formation,  cobbles  and  pebbles  of  igneous  and  meta- 
morphic rocks  dwindle  essentially  to  zero  through  a 
.section  10  to  20  m  (30  to  65  feet)  thick.  They  are 
gradually  replaced  by  reworked  sandstone  concretions 
and  ever  more  angular  fragments  of  porcelaneous  shale, 
rocks  common  in  the  Towslcy  and  Modclo  Forma- 
tions now  exposed  to  the  nortli  in  the  Santa  Susana 
.Mountains  (photo  1).  Through  the  above  transition, 
beds  of  coarse  clastic  debris  become  proportionately 
dominant  over  the  interbedded,  tan  siltstonc  that  is 
otherwise  so  predominant  in  the  upper  third  of  the 
upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation.  In  addition,  angu-

lar  fragments  of  porcelaneous  shale  become  essentially 
the  only  reworked  rock  type  in  the  coarse  clastic  beds. 

The  upper  15  to  20  m  (50  to  65  feet)  of  the  shale- 
fragment-rich  beds  at  the  top  of  the  Saugus  Formation 
are  thick,  cliff-forming,  debris-flow  breccias  cemented 
by  caliche  (photo  2).  Although  they  contain  local  un- 
conformities in  the  form  of  channel-fill  and  scour-fill 
structures,  layering  is  parallel  to  that  in  the  Saugus 
Formation  of  which  they  are  the  upper  part.  Bishop 
(1950)  estimated  a  thickness  of  198  m  (650  feet)  for 
the  shale-fragment-rich  upper  beds  of  the  Saugus  For- 
mation Mest  of  the  area.  Jennings  (1957)  suggested  a 
thickness  of  92  m  (300  feet)  in  Limekiln  Canyon. 

Teirace  deposits.  Quaternary  terrace  deposits  re- 
lated to  the  erosion  of  the  present  topography  lie  on 
ridge  crests  and  slopes  along  Limekiln  and  Aliso  Can- 
yons and  beneath  the  level  area  along  the  axis  of  the 


Horse  Flats  synclinc  at  Horse  Flats.  The  terrace  de- 
posits generally  consist  of  subangular  to  angular  shale 
fragments  and  more  or  less  eroded  and  broken  limy 
and  sandy  concretions.  The  Horse  Flats  deposits,  which 
are  more  silty,  include  pond  deposits.  Older  terrace 
deposits  commonly  are  cemented,  at  least  in  part,  by 
caliche  (Johnson,  1967).  Old  stream  channels  can,  in 
places,  be  traced  by  exposures  of  massive  and  banded 
travertine  similar  to  deposits  forming  in  present  water 
courses  (photo  3).  Slack  (1967)  has  described  this 
process  in  a  stream  in  Inyo  County. 

There  is  no  necessary  connection  between  the  trav- 
ertine and  caliche  deposits  and  faults  or  former  hot 
springs.  Except  for  one  zone  of  hydrothermal  alteration 
beneath  the  sole  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  at  the 
mouth  of  Bee  Canyon,  the  thrust  zone  is  not  mineral- 
ized. Where  it  is  mineralized,  the  altered  sediments  are

silicified  and  are  generally  unlike  caliche  or  travertine. 
Caliche  and  travertine  deposits  are,  in  this  area,  de- 
posited by  cold,  calciuni-carbonate-saturated  ground 
water  in  or  emanating  from  masses  of  carbonate-rich 
.Modelo  shale.  Part  of  the  former  extent  of  some  large, 
deeply  eroded  landslides  derived  from  the  thrust  zone 
can  be  traced  by  resistant  calcium  carbonate  deposits 
formed  in  them  and  around  their  former  perimeters. 
Such  deposits  are  part  of  the  evidence  of  massive  ero- 
sion of  tiic  thrust  zone. 

The  Quaternary  terrace  deposits  are  unconforma- 
ble on  all  older  rocks.  They  do  not  appear  to  be  de- 
formed, but  it  is  possible  that  they  are  cut  by  one  or 
more  faults  within  the  Devonshire  fault  zone. 

Eastern  Province 

Modelo  Formation.  In  this  province,  the  upper 
■Miocene  .Modelo  Formation  is  exposed  along  the  axis 
of  the  .Mission  Hills  anticline.  Most  of  this  exposure 
consists  of  platy,  punk&gt;-,  gray-to-white-weathering  dia- 
tomaceous  shale  interbcdded  with  limy  and  concre- 
tionary layers.  The  diatomaccous  shale  is  overlain  by 
IS  m  (50  feet)  of  brown-weathering  silty  shale.  Along 
the  south  flank  of  the  anticline,  there  is  a  poorly  ex- 
posed, well-indurated,  fine-  to  medium-grained,  tan- 
weathering  sandstone  that  may  be  parr  of  the  Modelo. 
This  sequence  appears  to  correlate  with  the  rocks  ex- 
posed above  the  sole  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  be- 
tween Limekiln  and  Bull  Canyons  in  the  northern 
province. 

Toivsley  Forvtat'ton.  Rocks  of  the  Mio-Plioccne 
Towsley  Formation  are  exposed  in  a  sheared  and 
faulted  syncline  in  a  fault-bounded  block  on  the  north 
flank  of  the  .Mission  Hills  anticline.  Dark  gray  to  black, 
brown-weathering,  silty  shale  lies  along  the  axis  of  the 
fold  and  against  the  northern  bounding  fault.  BeIo\v 
the  shale,  the  more  exposed  south  flank  of  the  syncline 
comprises  massive,  hard,  light  to  dark  brown-weather- 


ing sandstone  with  thin  intcrbeds  of  siltstone  and  a  few 
feet  of  hard,  dark  brow  n-wcathering  conglomerate  at 
the  base  of  the  exposed  section. 

Fico  Formation.  The  upper  183  m  (600  feet)  of 
the  Pliocene  Pico  Formation  were  formerly  (as  late  as 
the  summer  of  1971)  exposed  along  the  banks  of  Bull 
Creek,  east  of  Balboa  Boulevard  and  north  of  Rinaldi 
Street.  This  exposure  is  now  largely  obscured  by  a 
flood-control  channel.  The  upper  122  m  (400  feet)  of 
this  section  consist  of  interbedded  silt&gt;-  sandstone, 
sandy  conglomerate,  light  tan  and  gray  siltstone  and 
gray  and  tan  clay  shale.  The  lower  61  m  (200  feet) 
comprise  interbedded  gra\-  to  tan  sandy  and  sparsely 
pebbly  siltstone  and  silty  clay  shale.  Except  for  a 
shell  bed  a  foot  or  two  thick  at  the  contact  with  the 
overlying  Sunshine  Ranch  A4ember,  this  part  of  the 
section  appears  to  be  unfossiliferous. 

The  top  of  the  Pico  Formation  is  exposed  in  bull- 
dozer cuts  and  trenches  just  southwest  of  the  west 
abutment  of  Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  and  in  cuts  in 
the  floor  of  the  former  reservoir  just  upstream  from 
the  dam.  Here,  the  rocks  are  sparsely  fossiliferous,  fine, 
silty  sandstone  and  sandy  conglomerate  grading  down- 
ward into  fractured  claystone  and  clay  shale.  In  one 
exposure  north  of  the  dam,  highly  fossiliferous,  coarse- 
grained sandstone  surrounds  what  appear  to  be  dis- 
oriented blocks  of  silt&gt;'  sandstone.  These  blocks  prob- 
abl\-  were  rubble  at  the  foot  of  a  low  sea  cliflF  or 
ocean-floor  fault  scarp. 

Sunshine  Ranch  Member  of  the  Sauf^is  Formation. 
In  this  province,  the  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  is  an 
eastward  extension  of  the  rocks  exposed  in  the  south- 
ern province  except  that  the  contact  with  the  overly- 
ing upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation,  though  dis- 
tinct, is  less  well  marked  by  any  topographic  feature. 
The  contact  is  drawn  in  a  zone  of  transition  to  the 
more  dominantly  coarse,  clastic  rocks  at  the  base  of 
the  upper  part  of  the  formation  and  as  an  extension

Photo  3.  A  stereoscopic  photo  of  a  hillslope  remnant  of  a  former  water  course  in  which  rock  and  organic  debris  were 
cemented  together  with  calcium  carbonate  derived  from  saturated  surface  water.  The  channel  has  since  migrated  downslope 
to  the  right.  The  openings  are  the  former  site  of  uncemented  debris  deposited  during  periods  of  increased  flow  of  unsaturat- 
ed woter.  The  capping  carbonate,  slanting  down  from  the  upper  left  at  the  top  of  the  picture,  may  be  cemented  debris  once 
involved  in  blocking  and  diversion  of  the  channel.  This  deposit  is  on  the  west  margin  of  a  massive  landslide  area  lying 
east  of  the  Mission   Point  road  and  about  550  m   (1800  feet)   northwest  of  the   intersection  of  Doric   Street  and  Neon  Way. 


along  strike  of  the  contact  as  mapped  to  the  west  in 
the  southern  province. 

Upper  part  of  the  Snugtis  Formation.  In  the  east- 
ern province,  the  upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation 
is  also  an  eastward  extension  of  the  section  exposed  in 
the  southern  province,  except  that,  on  the  south  flank 
of  the  .Mission  Hills  syncline,  the  upper  beds,  rich  in 
shale  fragments,  are  missing.  The  absence  of  the  upper 
beds  is  probably  due  to  erosion,  but  it  may  be  that 
they  were  never  deposited  in  this  area.  Rocks  of  that 
lithology  are  exposed  at  the  west  end  of  the  syncline. 

Older  alhivhmi.  In  the  Van  Norman  Reservoir- 
Mission  Hills  area,  there  are  Quaternary  alluvial  de- 
posits lying  unconformably  on  the  eroded  older  rocks. 
On  the  south  flank  of  Mission  Hills  and  south  of  the 
west  abutment  of  the  lower  dam  (photo  4),  these  beds 
have  been  tilted  and  faulted. 

These  rocks  consist  of  interbedded,  iron-stained 
conglomerate  and  sandy  conglomerate  derived  in  part 
from  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains  and  tan  silty  sand- 
stone. The  age  of  these  deposits  is  uncertain.  Oake- 
shott  ("1958,  p.  86-87)  considered  these  beds  to  be 
part  of  his  middle  to  early  upper  Pleistocene  Pacoinia 
Formation.  AVeber  (this  Bulletin)  has  included  them 
with  his  "older  floodplain  deposits."  Similarly  weath- 
ered, older  alluvial  fans  of  the  San  Dimas  Formation 
(Eckis,  1928)  lying  to  the  east  along  the  south  margin 
of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  are  old  enough  to  have 
been  overridden  by  late  Quaternary  uplift  on  the 
Sierra  .Madre  fault  zone.  West  of  the  Van  Norman 
Reservoir  complex,  deposits  of  similar  age  are  most 
apt  to  resemble  the  uppermost  beds  of  the  Saugus 
Formation  in  being  rich  in  Miocene  shale  fragments 
and  cemented  b)'  caliche.  In  and  west  of  the  Aliso 
Canyon  area,  such  deposits  underlie  remnants  of  an 
old  erosion  surface  and,  as  at  Lower  San  Fernando 


Dam,  are  unconformable  on  the  Saugus  Formation. 
Some  of  the  old  surface  is  mapped  as  caliche,  but  the 
original  debris  included  such  diverse  material  as  land- 
slide deposits  (unit  designated  Qls  in  plate  2),  slope 
wash,  alluvium,  and  soil. 

SJRUaURE 

The  Three  Provinces 

The  three  provinces  (figure  1)  are  parts  of  struc- 
tural units  far  larger  than  the  areas  considered  in  this 
report.  The  northern  province  is  part  of  the  Santa 
Susana  Mountains.  The  southern  province  is  the 
faulted  and  folded  north  edge  of  rocks  lying  beneath 
the  San  Fernando  Valley.  The  eastern  province, 
though  it  contains  rocks  similar  in  age  and  origin  to 
those  in  the  southern  province,  appears  to  have  a 
structural  history  more  related  to  the  southernmost  of 
the  two  blocks  that  comprise  the  west  end  of  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains. 

The  Sequence  of  Events  and  Related  Features 

The  abrupt  transition  from  igneous  and  metamor- 
phic  to  sedimentary  rock  types  in  the  coarse  clastic 
beds  in  the  upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation  marks 
the  onset  of  the  Quaternary  orogen_\'  in  this  region. 
The  60  to  90  m  (200  to  300  feet)  of  conformable  beds 
deposited  during  and  after  the  transition  indicate  that 
uplift  at  a  new  source  was  well  under  way  before  the 
southern  province  was  folded  in  the  area  where  its 
rocks  are  now  exposed.  The  abundant  .Modelo  shale 
debris  in  the  top  beds  of  the  Saugus  came  from  the 
northern  province.  The  eastern  province  could  not 
have  been  the  source.  This  is  explained  as  follows. 

In  the  eastern  province,  the  Modelo  Formation  is 
exposed  in  the  .Mission  Hills  and  in  the  foothills  of 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  between  Pacoima  Wash

and  Big  Tujunga  Canyon.  In  the  Mission  Hills,  the 
Modelo  Formation  is  not  well  enough  exposed  even 
now  to  yield  the  range  of  rock  types  found  as  clasts 
in  the  Saugus.  Further,  the  fault  system  in  which  these 
hills  have  formed  cuts  the  unconformity  between 
older  alluvium  and  the  Saugus  Formation.  The  Modelo 
is  more  completely  exposed  between  Pacoima  Wash 
and  Big  Tujunga  Canyon;  but,  here,  it  was  not  yet 
deformed  and  uplifted  when  the  clasts  in  the  Saugus 
were  deposited,  for  it  is  overlain  by  essentially  con- 
formable Plio-Pleistocene  sedimentary  rocks. 

Tertiary  sedimentary  rocks  are  exposed  at  the  ex- 
treme \vest  end  of  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains,  east  of 
San  Fernando  Pass;  however,  here  the  Modelo  Forma- 
tion is  missing,  either  because  it  never  was  deposited 
that  high  on  the  surface  of  the  older  pre-Tertiary 
rocks  or  because  it  was  eroded  before  the  deposition 
of  the  Towsley  Formation  (Oakeshott,  1958,  plate  1; 
Winterer  and  Durham,  1962,  plate  44). 

The  fragments  of  Tertiary  sedimentary  rocks  in 
the  upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation  were  eroded 
from  the  initial  uplift  of  the  Santa  Susana  Mountains. 

In  this  area,  the  rocks  of  the  southern  province 
lie  in  four  major  folds  (figure  1).  From  west  to  east 
the\'  are:  the  Hadley  anticline,  the  Horse  Flats  syn- 
cline,  the  Mission  anticline,  and  the  Mission  Hills 
syncline.  Except  for  the  .Mission  Hills  syncline  (dis- 
cussed later),  the  axial  trend  of  these  folds  appears  to 
be  so  divergent  from  the  trace  of  the  Santa  Susana 
fault  here  as  to  suggest  that  they  predate  it;  how- 
ever, if  the  full  extent  of  the  Santa  Susana  fault  trace 
is  considered  (Bailey,  1954),  the  three  folds  in  question 
appear  essentially  parallel  to  its  over-all  trend.  Fur- 
thermore, the  axial  planes  of  the  Mission  anticline  and 
the  Horse  Flats  syncline  dip  northeastward  in  accord- 
ance with  the  thrust-generating  stress. 

It  seems  likely  that  the  folding  of  the  southern 
province  took  place  during  the  mid-Pleistocene  im- 
mediately before  and  while  it  was  being  overridden 
by  the  Santa  Susana  thrust.  This  was  the  first  major 
event  in  the  Quaternary  deformation  of  the  region. 
The  stress  appears  mainly  to  have  been  from  northeast 
to  southwest.  Perhaps  the  more  easterly  orientation  of 
the  east  end  of  the  thrust  zone  was  caused  by  drag  in 
the  older,  less  easih-  deformed  rocks  now  exposed  at 
the  west  end  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  A  de- 
crease in  the  magnitude  of  displacement  at  the  east  end 
of  the  thrust  zone  is  suggested  by  the  fact  that  the 
sedimentary  rocks  exposed  there  are  younger  than 
those  comprising  the  zone  of  the  thrust  farther  west. 
In  a  discussion  of  a  10-km  (6-miIe)  segment  of  the 
Santa  Susana  thrust,  Hazzard  (1944)  postulated  a  maxi- 
mum north-south  displacement  of  2480  m  (8000  feet). 
Ingram  (1959)  suggests  vertical  displacement  of  1550 
m  (5000  feet)  and  horizontal  displacement  of  4  to 
5  km  (2  to  3  miles).  If  the  isolated  outcrop  of  the 
Modelo  Formation  just  cast  of  Limekiln  Canyon  and 
south  of  Horse  Flats  is  the  faulted  remnant  of  a 
klippe,  the  sole  of  the  thrust  was  once  at  least  1 860  m 
(6000  feet)  south  of  its  present  trace  at  Limekiln 
Canyon;  thus  the  volume  of  rock  removed  by  erosion 
during  the  last  million  and  a  half  years  would  be  large 
indeed.  It  is  noteworthy  that  rocks  and  structures 
such  as  those  described  by  Kahlc  (this  Bulletin),  be- 


fore and  beneath  the  Lakeview  fault,  are  not  found  in 
this  area. 

In  any  event,  the  trace  of  the  north-to-northeast- 
dipping  Santa  Susana  thrust  has  been  moved  north  by 
deep  erosion.  The  sole  of  the  thrust  is  obscured  by  a 
variety  of  surficial  deposits,  some  of  which  cover  the 
entire  zone.  I  found  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  dis- 
placement in  the  fault  zone  has  affected  any  of  these 
deposits  prior  to  the  limited,  local  effects  of  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake.  Indeed,  the  evidence  suggests 
that  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  has  been  inactive  since  the 
middle  Pleistocene.  The  involvement  of  this  fault  zone 
in  effects  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  (to  be  dis- 
cussed later)  is  more  aptly  attributable  to  the  fact  that 
a  small  eastern  segment  of  it  overlaps  the  currently 
active  west  end  of  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains. 

Several  authors  (Bishop,  1950;  Jennings,  1957;  Slos- 
son  and  Barnhart,  1967)  have  suggested  late-Pleistocene 
displacement  on  the  Santa  Susana  thrust.  These  work- 
ers described  post-Saugus  Pleistocene  terraces  as  hav- 
ing been  deformed  and  overridden  by  the  thrust.  Their 
descriptions  make  it  apparent  that  they  have  applied 
the  term  terrace  (with  an  attached  late-Pleistocene  age 
connotation)  to  the  uppermost  beds  of  the  Saugus 
Formation.  There  is  insufficient  evidence  that  they 
were  once  part  of  a  terraced  landscape  to  define  them 
as  terrace  deposits.  These  beds  probably  are  no  younger 
than  middle  Pleistocene,  for  they  are  (as  previously 
described)  the  uppermost  beds  of  the  Saugus  Forma- 
tion. 

Starting  in  the  middle  Pleistocene,  an  important 
group  of  faults  developed  during  the  folding  of  the 
Saugus  Formation.  Alovement  bet\\een  the  sandstone 
layers  in  the  Saugus  Formation  forced  most  adjustment 
to  take  place  in  the  ^\•eaker,  clay-rich  beds  between 
the  sandstone  layers,  as  air  might  adjust  to  spaces  be- 
tween bent  playing  cards.  Some  of  these  faults  were 
confined  to  a  single  bedding  plane  or  to  a  narrow 
crushed  zone  an  inch  or  two  wide;  but,  just  as  com- 
monly, the  entire  clay-rich  unit  was  completely 
sheared  (photo  5).  Near  the  surface,  the  shear  planes 
and  voids  in  these  faults  are  apt  to  be  filled  with 
caliche.  Some  faults  cut  across  bedding  (generally  at 
lo\\'  angles)  bet^vccn  the  weak  beds.  Such  faults  are 
most  abundant  in  zones  of  intense  deformation  such  as 
that  near  the  sole  of  the  Santa  Susana  fault  (figure  3). 

Most  of  the  faults  that  parallel  the  folding  in  the 
Saugus  Formation  are  a  result  of  stress  before  and 
beneath  the  Santa  Susana  thrust.  However,  subsequent 
Late  Quaternary  faulting  and  folding  in  the  west  end 
of  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains  has  periodicall\'  reacti- 
vated many  of  these  faults,  especially  those  in  the  .Mis- 
sion Hills  syncline  as  is  manifest  in  some  of  the  dis- 
placements that  occurred  during  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  (photo  6). 

The  Aliso  fault,  which  cuts  the  southwest  flank  of 
the  Mission  anticline,  has  been  subject  to  displacement 
at  least  as  late  as  early-to-middle  Pleistocene.  This 
fault  has  displaced  rocks  as  \'oung  as  the  base  of  the 
upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation.  Erosion  has  re- 
moved any  evidence  of  its  effect  on  the  uppermost 
beds  of  the  Saugus;  however,  the  apparent  separation 
of  the  Sunshine" Ranch-Saugus  contact  suggests  small 
total  displacement.

feet  west  of  the  west  obutment  of  Lower  Son  Fernondo  Dam.  This  is 
one  of  the  few  such  beds  in  the  basal  part  of  the  Sunshine  Ranch 
Member  of  the  Sougus  Formation.  It  is  one  of  a  set  of  northeast- 
trending  sheared  beds  and  faults  crossing  the  bed  of  Lower  Von 
Norman  Reservoir,  and  almost  certoinly  was  a  site  of  displacement 
during  the  uplift  of  the  Mission  Hills  anticline.  Note  the  well-exposed 
shear  plane  near  the  head  of  the  hammer. 


The  Devonshire  fault  zone  has  been  active  later 
than  the  Santa  Susana  fault.  It  has  completely  shattered 
the  low,  open  arch  of  the  Hadlcy  anticline;  and,  if  the 
.Miocene  rocks  exposed  in  its  zone  arc  part  of  a  klippe, 
it  has  cut  the  sole  of  the  thrust.  If  tiie  .Miocene  rocks 
are  a  remnant  of  a  landslide,  displacement  in  the 
Devonshire  fault  zone  could  still  he  considered  post- 
thrust.  One  fault  in  this  zone  appears  to  have  disturbed 
the  old  caliche-cemented  surface  of  probable  Late 
Quaternary'  age  described  under  "Older  Alluvium." 
The  Devonshire  fault  probably  should  be  considered 
active. 

The  Northridpe  Hills  fault,  a  short  segment  of 
which  was  covered  in  this  mapping,  is  a  high-angle 
fault  along  \\  hich  displacement  has  been  late  enough  to 
fault  and  fold  the  uppermost  beds  of  the  Saugus  For- 
mation. Ground  water  flow  is  affected  b\'  this  fault  as 
far  southeast  as  the  San  Diego  Freewa\-  (California 
State  \\'ater  Rights  Board,  1962'). 

The  choice  of  the  Mission  Hills  fault  (extended  as 
proposed  in  figure  1)  as  the  west  boundary  of  the 
eastern  province  is  based  upon  detailed  surface  map- 
ping and  subsurface  data.  At  best,  this  fault  is  only  one 


of  numerous  faults  that  might  be  considered  the 
boundary  of  the  west  end  of  the  San  Gabriel  .Moun- 
tains. 

The  greatest  uplift  and  fault  displacement  in  the 
eastern  province  are  in  and  around  the  Mission  Hills 
anticline  (figure  2).  The  east-trending  .Mission  Hills 
anticline  has  moved  upw  ard  as  a  piercemcnt-like  stnic- 
ture  bounded  on  the  south  by  the  concealed  .Mission 
Hills  fault  zone  and  on  the  north  by  a  fault  zone  that 
dips  north  in  the  subsurface.  The  I -ate  Quaternary 
age  of  this  movement  is  indicated  b\-  the  deformed  and 
faulted  older  alluvium  on  the  south  flank  of  the  .Mission 
Hills  and  just  southwest  of  the  west  abutment  of 
Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  (photo  4).  Older  alluvium 
exposed  in  a  trench  is  also  faulted  just  southeast  of  the 
east  abutment  of  the  L'pper  San  Fernando  Dam. 

During  or  after  the  upward  movement  of  the  .Mis- 
sion Hills  anticline,  the  adjoining  part  of  the  province 
moved  upward  and  west  to  southwestward.  Ero- 
sion of  the  uplifted,  north-dipping  beds  has  produced 
the  apparent  left-lateral  separation  in  the  Sunshine 
Ranch-Saugus  contact  on  the  northwest  boundary  of 
the  province.  The  actual  displacement  on  this  bound- 
ary could  have  been,  in  part,  right-lateral  oblique 
(figure  2).  The  right-lateral  faults  cutting  the  north- 
east flank  of  the  Mission  anticline  could  represent  a 
northwestward  dispersion  of  deformation  on  this  side 
of  the  eastern  province,  in  contrast  to  the  south-bound- 
ing fault  segment  where  deformation  and  faulting  arc 
more  concentrated.  At  any  rate,  it  is  more  logical  to 
attribute  these  faults  to  force  emanating  from  the  east- 
ern province  than  from  the  northern  province  because 
the  probable  south-southwest  direction  of  movement 
of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  would  have  been  more  apt 
to  displace  such  faults  in  a  left-lateral  sense  near  its 
east  end. 

The  existence  of  the  .Mission  Hills  syncline  is  as- 
sumed on  the  basis  of  the  attitude  of  exposed  strata  and 
a  reasonable  match  of  beds  from  one  flank  to  the  other. 
The  presence  and  magnitude  of  faulting  in  the  con- 
cealed part  of  this  structure  is  uncertain.  The  limited 
subsurface  data  available  support  the  presence  of  a 
southeast-dipping  fault;  but  additional  subsurface  data 
are  needed  to  determine  the  extent  of  this  fault  or  of 
other  faults,  such  as  the  Olive  \new,  that  can  be  pro- 
jected toward  the  area  from  the  northeast. 

The  rocks  at  the  west  end  of  the  .Mission  Hills 
syncline  (figure  3)  were  disturbed  because  they  were 
close  to  the  sole  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust.  They  were 
displaced  to  an  undetermined  extent  by  reverse  faults. 
Whether  these  reverse  faults  continue  eastward  can  be 
determined  only  by  using  subsurface  information.  F.ven 
if  they  do  extend  easrward,  they  are  probably  no 
more  active  than  the  Santa  Susana  fault. 

The  trend  of  the  .Mission  Hills  syncline  is  roughly 
parallel  to  the  trace  of  the  Santa  Susana  fault.  Indeed, 
this  structure  probably  first  formed  in  response  to 
stress  adjacent  to  the  east  end  of  the  fault  zone;  how- 
ever, the  present  asymmetry  of  the  .Mission  Hills  syn- 
cline indicates  greater  deformation  in  its  south  flank. 
This  deformation  seems  clearly  to  have  tieen  a  response 
to  compression  on  the  north  flank  of  the  piercement- 
like  block  of  older  rocks  exposed  in  the  Mission  Hills 
just  east  of  Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  (figure  2).

Tilt-Altered  Surface  Drainage 

In  the  southern  province,  the  drainage  pattern  is 
strongly  controlled  hy  the  structure  except  for  Lime- 
kiln Canyon,  which  is  superposed.  In  the  eastern  prov- 
ince, the  drainage  is  largely  of  cross-cutting,  super- 
posed character.  This  pattern  may,  in  part,  be 
attributed  to  the  fact  that  the  folds  lie  athwart  the 
drainage  issuing  from  San  Fernando  Pass;  but  there  is 
also  evidence  of  a  possible  Late  Quaternary  change  in 
drainage  pattern  (figure  4).  The  geology  of  the  east- 
em  province  and  the  effects  of  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  indicate  upward  and  westward  displace- 
ment of  that  area.  Stream  channel  patterns  suggest  an 
eastward  shift  of  drainage  in  response  to  eastward  tilt 
of  the  part  of  the  eastern  province  included  in  this 
area. 

The  stream  course  issuing  from  Bee  Canyon, 
which  now  turns  eastward,  may  once  have  flowed 
south  through  the  broad  channel  now  occupied  by 
the  insignificant  north  branch  of  Bull  Creek.  The  three 
narrow  \-alleys  immediateh*  to  the  east  probabh'  are 
normal  ohsequent  tributaries  of  Bull  Creek  with  gradi- 
ents reduced  b&gt;'  eastw  ard  tilting.  The  channel  of  Bull 
Creek,  between  its  main  tributary  and  the  southern 
margin  of  the  hills,  and  channel  c  (figure  4)  are  en- 
trenched, possibly  as  a  result  of  uplift.  Data  on  tribu- 
taries b,  c,  and  d  were  derived  from  pre-development 
(1952)  vertical  aerial  photographs.  The  north  fork  of 
Bull  Creek  stays  on  the  east  side  of  its  valley  as  does 
the  main  channel  south  of  their  confluence;  and,  upon 
leaving  the  hills,  the  main  course  veers  sharply  east 
like  that  of  Bee  Canyon.  Bull  Creek  Canyon  appears 
to  have  been  tilted  easr\\ard.  Such  tilt  probably  was 
the  result  of  Late  Quaternary  activation  of  the  faults 
bounding  the  west  side  of  the  eastern  province  (figure 
2).  The  San  Fernando  earthquake  yielded  data  that 
appear  to  support  this  view ,  the  data  of  greatest  inter- 
est being  on  tiie  direction  of  vertical  and  horizontal 
movement,    the    distribution    of    damaged    structures 


late  in  1967.  The  Torso  Street  breok  (see  plote  3,  locotion  3)  occurred 
re  typical  of  the  upper  part  of  the  Sougus  Formation.  Unit  a  is  light- 
and  soft  sandstone  with  beds  of  pebble  conglomerote.  The  pebble  beds 
and  subordinate  amounts  of  angular  porcelaneous  shale  fragments.  Unit  d 
concretions,  lithologicolly  similar  and  probably  equivalent  to  the  upper, 
lines  are  planes  of  shearing  with  one-barbed  arrows  showing  relative 
Sana   thrust  once  lay   a   short  distonce   above   these   beds;   its   eroded   trace 


(Greensfelder,    1971),  and  the   distribution  of  after- 
shocks (U.S.  Geological  Survey  staff,  1971). 

In  summary,  the  sequence  of  events  in  this  area  is: 

1.  Essentially  uninterrupted  deposition  of  sediments  from 
middle  Miocene  to  middle  Pleistocene  time,  the  uppermost 
beds  of  which  record  the  onset  of  orogeny. 

2.  The  middle  Pleistocene,  post-Saugus  pre-older  alluvium 
thrust  faulting  and  folding  of  rocks  in  and  adjacent  to  the 
zone  of  the  Sonto  Susona  thrust,  and  the  formation  of  the 
Sonta  Susona  Mountains. 

3.  Late  Pleistocene  to  Holocene  uplift  of  the  west  end  of 
the  Son  Gabriel  Mountains  and  Mission  Hills.  Concurrent 
uplift  and  modification  of  the  east  end  of  the  Santo  Susona 
fault  zone  and  adjacent  associated  structures.  Concurrent 
displocement  on  the  zones  of  the  Devonshire  and  Northridge 
Hills  faults. 

Surface  Breaks  Associated  with  the  San  Fernando 
Earthquake  of  February  9,  1971 

Surface  breaks  of  probable  tectonic  origin.  A  sur- 
face break,  clearly  identifiable  as  a  fault,  disrupted  the 
San  Diego  Freeway  and  formed  low  scarps  and  breaks 
in  cuts  and  adjacent  natural  slopes  on  the  north  flank 
of  the  Alission  Hills  (57).*  This  displacement  was  re- 
verse, north  side  up  about  20  cm  (8  inches),  on  bed- 
ding planes  in  the  Sunshine  Ranch  ,\Iember  of  the 
Saugus  Formation  (photo  6).  This  is  part  of  the  Res- 
ervoir segment  of  surface  breaks  (Weber,  this  Bul- 
letin). This  displacement  fits  the  model  described  in 
figure  2;  but  the  mechanics  of  the  deformation  differ 
from  the  model  in  that  the  fault  zone  above  which 
maximum  deformation  took  place  lies  north,  rather 
than  south,  of  the  Mission  Hills.  Local  uplift  was  cen- 
tered at  the  junction  of  the  San  Diego  and  Golden 
State  Freeways.  Differential  vertical  movement  be- 
tween this  area  and  the  Mission  Hills  exceeded  60  cm 
(2  feet).  The  break  (piioto  6)  lies  at  about  the  30  cm 
(  1  foot)  contour  line  on  the  soutli  fiank  of  tiic  uplift 
(Ricliard  R.  Hopkins,  Bureau  of  Engineering,  City  of 
Los  Angeles,  personal  communication,  1972).

The  stream  issuing  from  Bee  Canyon  (large  arrow  2)  once  occupied  the  brood,  south-southeast-trending  channel  a  (lorge  arrow  1).  Chonnels  b, 
c,  and  d  may  hove  had  their  gradients  lowered  by  tilting,  thus  allowing  debris  to  accumulate  in  their  valleys.  The  north  fork  of  Bull  Creek,  W, 
occupies  a  valley  that  is  broader  than  that  occupied  by  the  more  vigorous  main  course.  The  north  course,  W,  and  the  main  channel  south  of  their 
confluence  at  X,  appear  to  have  migrated  to  the  east  side  of  their  valley  (W,  X,  Y)  and,  like  the  present  drainage  from  Bee  Canyon,  takes  a  sharp 
eastward  turn  as  it  leaves  the  hills  (2).  Below  the  confluence  (X),  the  channel  (X,  Y,  Z)  is  entrenched,  possibly  due  to  uplift,  and  as  a  conse- 
quence channel   c   has  also   become   entrenched.

In  other  exposures  of  the  Sunshine  Ranch  Member 
and  the  upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation,  there 
were  numerous  small  displacements  on  bedding  planes, 
few  of  which  showed  measurable  separations. 

There  was  evidence  of  small  displacements  of  bed- 
ding planes  in  a  bedrock  outcrop  on  the  west  shore 
of  Upper  \'an  Norman  Reservoir.  To  the  ^est,  where 
the  \\est  end  of  .Mission  Hills  s\nc!ine  is  exposed  by 
grading,  1  to  2  cm  (three-quarters  of  an  inch)  of  re- 
verse displacement  (north  side  up)  occurred  roughly 
parallel  to  bedding.  This  break  had  a  lateral  extent  of 
about  240  m  (800  feet)  south  of  and  across  Torsa 
Street  (3).  Where  the  break  crossed  Torsa  Street, 
between  Neon  Way  and  Tyson  Place,  the  sidewalks 
and  curb  were  chipped  and  buckled  by  compression. 
For  future  reference,  tiiis  will  be  called  the  Torsa 
Street  break  (figure  3).  At  this  site,  most  of  the  faults 
probably  were  first  caused  by  drag  beneath  the  sole 
of  the  Santa  Susana  fault. 

The  westward  component  of  movement  gener- 
ated by  the  earthquake  (Greensfeldcr,  1971)  was 
parallel  to  the  axis  of  the  Mission  Hills  syncline.  The 
permanent  ground  deformation  ma\'  have  been  ab- 
sorbed through  small  parallel  displacements  on  the 
many  shear  zones  in  the  Sunshine  Ranch  .Member  and 
upper  part  of  the  Saugus  Formation.  Robert  V.  Sharp 
(this  Bulletin)  has  suggested  similar  structural  control 
of  deformation  parallel  to  bedding  planes  in  folded 
rocks  to  the  east  of  this  area. 

The  sole  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  was  the  site 
of  a  small,  generally  left-lateral  displacement  traceable 
from  a  point  about  a  half  a  kilometer  (a  quarter  of  a 
mile)  northeast  of  the  San  Diego  Freeway  west  to  an 
area  just  east  of  the  mouth  of  Bee  Canyon  (Barrows 
and  others,  1971).  The  surface  expression  of  this  dis- 
placement  ranges   from   sharp,   localized   offsets   and 


cracks  in  bedrock  and  paving  through  parallel  and 
en  echelon  zones  of  diffuse  cracks  and  small  rockfalls 
to  no  discernible  disruption.  The  most  obvious  break 
was  a  30  cm  (12-13  inches)  offset  in  the  road  to  the 
St.  \'incent  de  Paul  Boys  Camp,  a  bedrock  exposure 
of  the  thrust  (photo  7).  Conversely,  the  alluvium  of 
San  Fernando  Pass  showed  no  clear  surface  breaks. 
To  the  west,  this  break  appears  to  turn  northwest 
across  the  zone  of  the  thrust  into  the  mouth  of  Bee 
Can_\'on  where  it  disappears. 

It  is  difficult  to  categorize  this  break.  It  probably 
is  not  tectonic  in  the  sense  that  it  represents  fault  dis- 
placement extending  to  great  depth;  however,  it  is  at 
the  west  end  of  a  zone  of  ground  breaks  extending 
eastward  (parallel  to  and  possibly  coincident  with  an 
active  I -ate  Quaternary  scarp)  that  includes  a  tectonic 
displacement  just  west  of  Pacoima  Gin_\'on  (Weber, 
Barrows,  this  Bulletin).  The  displacement  in  the  trace 
of  the  Santa  Susana  fault  is  most  aptly  described  as 
response  of  a  pre-existing  fault  to  stress  originating  in 
another  fault  system. 

Structural  damage  relatable  to  this  break  includes 
minor  damage  to  the  .Metropolitan  Water  District 
Balboa  Inlet  Tunnel  about  490  m  (1600  feet)  from 
the  south  portal  (Duke,  1971,  p.  234).  The  rcinforced- 
concretc  bridge,  built  where  Balboa  Boulevard  crosses 
the  freeway,  was  jammed  against  its  southwest  abut- 
ment (18).  The  projected  trace  of  the  sole  of  the 
thrust  passes  beneath  this  structure.  The  northwest 
leg  of  a  steel  power-line  tower,  situated  in  the  zone 
of  the  thrust,  buckled,  suggesting  up-dip  displacement 
(photo  8).  At  this  site,  overlooking  the  west  side  of 
San  Fernando  Pass,  displacement  appears  to  have  been 
less  confined  to  the  sole  of  the  thrust. 

The  Cascade  oil  field  lies  about  a  half  a  kilometer 
(a  quarter  of  a  mile)  north  of  the  surface  breaks  on 
the  Santa  Susana  thrust.  AV^ells  in  this  field  penetrate

the  sole  of  the  thrust.  The  wells  in  the  Aliso  Canyon 
oil  field  also  penetrate  the  thrust  but  in  an  area  less 
disturbed  by  the  San  Fernando  earthquake.  The  fol- 
lowing observations  were  made  by  and  obtained  from 
California  Division  of  Oil  and  Gas  engineers  R.  John- 
son and  G.  Ledingham  on  February  18  and  19,  1971: 

"McCulloch  well  No.  'Mission-Visco'  [Cascade  oil  field]  1 
sanded  up  and  was  being  pulled;  well  No.  'Mission-Visco'  2 
was  shut  down  due  to  a  landslide;  and  well  No.  'Misslon- 
Visco'  3  was  shut  down  due  to  movement  of  the  pumping 
unit  in  response  to  settling  of  the  mat  fill.  Several  oil  field 
pipelines  were  broken,  and  many  road  surfaces  were 
cracked.  It  was  reported  that  the  field  seemed  to  be  produc- 
ing  more   gas   after   the   earthquake."

Aliso'  wash  tank  has  been  damaged  but  appeared  to  be 
in  use.  Many  oil  field  pipelines  were  broken.  Several  land- 
slides were  observed,  and  at  least  three   roads  were  closed." 

Two  breaks  formed  across  the  north-northwest- 
trending  crest  of  the  cliff  on  the  northeast  wall  of  Bee 
Canyon  (9)  northwest  of  Cascade  oil  field.  The 
smaller,  more  northerly  break  was  down  15  cm  (6 
inches)  on  the  south  side;  and,  near  by,  the  more 
southerly  break  was  down  about  60  cm  (2  feet)  on 
the  south  side.  Where  exposed  in  the  scar  of  a  fresh 
rockfall,  the  southern  break  appears  to  have  resulted 
from  renewed  movement  on  pre-existing  shear  planes, 
whose  iron-stained  surfaces  dip  75°  north  at  the  top 
of  the  cliff  and  appear  to  curve  to  a  shallower  angle, 
roughly  coincident  with  the  bedding  about  60  to  90  m 


(200  to  300  feet)  across  the  cliff  face.  The  subsurface 
configuration  of  the  north  break  is  not  evident. 

Other  surface  breaks.  Just  north  of  Lower  San 
Fernando  Dam,  a  bedding-plane  fault  is  exposed  on 
the  crest  of  an  isolated  prominence,  the  upper  6  to  10 
m  (about  20  to  30  feet)  of  which  stood  above  water 
as  an  island  in  the  former  reservoir.  A  displacement  of 
2  cm  (about  three  quarters  of  an  inch),  down  on  the 
north  side,  occurred  at  the  top  of  the  island  (53).  This 
fault  was  subsequcnth'  traceable  some  250  m  (about 
820  feet)  southwest  through  two  artificial  cuts,  but 
there  was  no  discernible  displacement  in  those  ex- 
posures. The  significance  of  this  break  is  not  certain. 
Such  a  small  displacement  demands  optimum  surface 
conditions  for  expression;  a  bedrock  surface  normal 
to  the  direction  of  movement  like  that  at  the  top  of 
the  island,  for  example.  Most  of  the  west  slope  of  the 
island  is  covered  by  loose  cobbiy  sand.  Cracking  fol- 
lowed down  the  bedding  across  the  narrow  exposure 
above  the  water  line  on  the  steep  east  slope  of  the  is- 
land. If  this  break  had  great  lateral  extent,  most  of  it 
would  have  been  under  wet  unconsolidated  sediments 
and  water.  During  the  draining  of  the  reservoir,  wave 
action  and  aftershocks  would  have  further  reduced 
surface  expression.  The  strongest  arguments  against 
calling  this  break  tectonic  appear  to  lie  in  the  pos- 
sibility of  its  being  ridge-top  lurching  and  in  that  it 
does  not  fit  the  model  proposed  in  figure  2. 

A  bedding  plane  displacement  in  the  shale  of  the 
Modelo  Formation  was  found  near  the  water  line  just 
east  of  the  lower  dam.  This  break  was  not  found  in 
pristine  condition,  and  the  degree  of  modification  by 
water  or  shaking  was  not  evident.  It  has  an  exposed 
length  of  4  to  5  m  (about  15  feet)  and  is  up  on  the

greater  than  30  cm  (a  foot).

northwest  about  10  cm  (4  inches).  The  northeast  end 
of  tliis  break  appears  to  be  truncated  by  a  joint  or 
fault  of  small  displacement.  Similar  joints  or  faults  arc 
common  in  exposures  up  the  slope,  and  it  is  possible 
that  this  isolated  break  resulted  from  downslopc  rota- 
tion of  a  block  of  shale  either  during  the  earthquake 
or  at  some  earlier  time.  In  the  latter  instance,  lake- 
shore  erosion  could  have  considerabK"  modified  the 
evidence.  A  tectonic  origin  for  this  break  cannot  be 
completel\-  discounted  without  more  data  on  the  de- 
tailed geology  of  this  slope. 


One  manifestation  of  locally  intense  ground  mo- 
tion was  the  "shattered  ridge"  (photo  9).  West  of 
San  Fernando  Pass,  this  effect  was  concentrated,  with 
few  exceptions,  in  and  near  the  Santa  Susana  thrust 
zone  on  a  group  of  low  ridges  northeast  of  the  mouth 
of  Bee  Canyon. 

On  a  typical  "shattered"  ridge,  the  accumulated 
weathered  rock  and  soil  appears  to  have  been  tossed 
(photo  9).  The  suggested  vertical  acceleration  greater 
than  1  g  is  difficult  to  account  for  in  the  area  in  which 
the  ridges  lie,  but  it  is  possible  that  local  refraction  of 


1974 


San  Fernando  Earthquake — Geology  and  Geophysics

wave  motion  took  place.  (See  Davis  and  West,  this 
Bulletin).  Effects  of  strong  motion  are  in  a  zone  in 
and  south  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust.  In  the  Bee  Can- 
yon area,  part  of  the  thrust  zone  was  affected.  To 
the  west,  the  effects  are  concentrated  in  a  rapidly 
narrowing  belt  south  of  (beneath)  the  sole  of  the 
thrust.  The  sole  of  the  thrust  marks  a  sharp  lithologic 
and  topographic  break.  As  Richter  (1958,  p.  60) 
stated,  "Normally  we  expect  earthquake  intensity  to 
be  higher  on  loose  material  than  on  basement  rock; 
but  this  holds  only  when  there  is  no  great  difference 
in  conditions  along  the  path.  Then  the  absorption  of 
energy  takes  place  chiefly  near  the  surface,  but  the 
amplitude  of  seismic  waves  is  actually  increased  there 
and  the  effects  on  structures  are  greater." 

Some  ridges  bear  evidence  of  both  horizontal  and 
vertical  movement.  One  such  ridge  is  a  hogback  just 
above  the  zone  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust  and  west  of 
the  Cascade  oil  field  (8).  The  crest  of  this  narrow 
steep-sided  prominence  had  been  graded  for  a  drilling 
site  (photo  10).  Bedding  planes  in  both  the  natural 
and  cut  surface  parallel  the  crest  of  this  northeast- 
trending  ridge  and  dip  60°  to  75°  southeast.  Vertical 
displacement  in  excess  of  30  cm  (1  foot)  occurred 
on  one  bedding  plane,  and  numerous  lesser  displace- 
ments and  tension  cracks  opened  up  along  other 
planes.  Locally,  the  tension  cracks  give  the  ridge  the 
appearance  of  opening  like  a  book  standing  on  its 
spine.  Abundant  rockfalls  scar  the  flanks  of  the  ridge. 

A  break  occurred  on  a  ridge  in  the  zone  of  the 
thrust  north  of  the  Torsa  Street  area  (5).  Here  dis- 
placement between  shale  and  overlying  sandstone 
caused  a  crack  about  25  cm  (10  inches)  wide  and 
25  cm  (10  inches)  down  on  the  the  south  side.  The 
trend  of  this  ridge  is  normal  to  the  bedding.  The 
cracking  diminished  down  the  flanks  of  the  ridge,  be- 
coming untraceable  before  reaching  the  bottom. 


*^ 


On  some  ridges  near  the  mouth  of  Bee  Canyon, 
slumps  occurred  on  the  northeast-facing  slopes  in 
greater  abundance  than  on  those  facing  southwest. 
This  could  be  viewed  as  inertial  lag  behind  a  north- 
'east-to-southwest  force,  but  other  factors  complicate 
this  simple  view.  Northeast-facing  slopes  tend  to  be 
more  moist,  better  \\  oodcd,  and  more  deeph-  mantled 
with  surficial  deposits  than  those  with  southwest  ex- 
posure. Horizontal  motion  is  suggested  on  some  dis- 
turbed ridge  tops  (photo  9)  by  preferred  orientation 
of  soil  clods  bearing  remnants  of  the  pre-earthquake 
surface,  but  these  effects  commonly  grade  downward 
into  slope  failures,  and  more  often  than  not  such  ori- 
entation can  be  related  to  some  such  feature. 

Most  slope  failures  were  earthquake-triggered 
slumps  or  rockfalls  at  sites  where  such  features  have 
been  a  major  part  of  the  normal  mass-wasting  process 
and  could  have  been  expected.  Renewed  movement 
occurred  in  some  old  landslides,  one  of  the  most  im- 
portant being  in  the  face  of  the  Balboa  Boulevard  cut 
southwest  of  the  freeway  overpass  (17).  Here  exca- 
vation removed  support  from  the  head  and  crown  of 
an  old  slide.  Earthquake  shaking  triggered  movement 
in  the  poorly  supported  mass.  Highway  cuts  experi- 
enced similar  failures  at  San  Fernando  Pass  (Evans, 
this  Bulletin). 

Some  cracks  in  streets  and  structures  in  subdivi- 
sions in  the  hilly  area  west  of  the  Van  Norman  Res- 
ervoir complex  may  be  attributable  to  displacement 
between  fills  and  subjacent  materials,  but  such  bound- 
aries are  not  generally  easy  to  trace.  A  crack  on  the 
east  side  of  Darla  Avenue  (4)  may  be  considered  an 
example. 

Whatever  their  cause,  the  shattered  ridges  and 
adjacent  slope  failures  here  and  in  other  areas  affected 
by  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  present  problems  for 
consideration  in  future  development.  Even  such  older.

probabl)'  innctivc  fault  zones  as  the  Santa  Susana 
should  be  suspect  as  potential  zones  of  refraction  and 
related  surface  eflFects. 

Most  of  the  cracking  affecting  low-lying  alluvial 
surfaces  west  of  the  San  Diego  Frec\va\'  was  concen- 
trated in  and  around  Upper  Van  Norman  Reser\'oir. 
Here,  Quaternary  sediments  lie  in  the  eroded  axial 
trough  of  the  Mission  Hills  synclinc.  Botii  surface 
water  and  ground  water  is  normally  ponded  in  this 
area. 

The  Torsa  Street  break  (?)  may  be  a  manifesta- 
tion of  westward  compression  in  the  area  northwest 
of  the  Van  Norman  Reservoirs.  The  same  sense  of 
motion  is  seen  in  the  response  of  surface  structures 
too  rigid  to  absorb  all  of  the  force  by  compression. 
East-west-oriented  blacktop  facing  on  levees  around 
Upper  Van  Norman  Reservoir  moved  westward, 
buckling  and  overlapping  pavement  on  the  west  side. 
Upper  San  Fernando  Dam  bowed  about  1.5  m  (5  feet) 
downstream.  In  the  \^an  Gogli  Sciiool  area,  curbs  and 
sidewalks  were  chipped  and  buckled.  TIic  period  of 
shaking  following  the  initial  shock  resulted  in  a  gen- 
eral subsidence  and  east\\-ard  and  southeastward  move- 
ment of  alluvium.  This  caused  numerous  tension  cracks 
in  the  alluvium  and  in  such  slightly  compressed  bodies 
as  the  recentl\'  laid  blacktop  pavements  in  the  area 
around  \''an  Gogh  School  (6).  Tlic  pattern  of  tension 
cracks  suggests  that  tlie  direction  of  subsidence  may 
have  been  controlled,  to  some  extent,  by  the  configur- 
ation of  the  bedrock.  Tliis  and  similar  cracking  to  the 
east  is  attributed  to  landsliding  bv  Youd  and  Olsen 
(1971). 

Abundant  large  slumps  damaged  levees  at  the 
north  end  of  Upper  V■^r\  Norman  Reservoir,  and  one 
slump  heading  just  nortli  of  the  powerhouse  discon- 
nected that  structure  from  the  aqueduct  rube.  Sand 
boils  in  the  lake  bed  adjoining  some  levcc  failures  in- 
dicate at  least  partial  liquefaction  of  unconsolidated 
sediments  during  earthquake-induced  shaking. 

March  31  Aftershock 

The  impact  of  the  damaging  March  31  aftershock 
was  most  severe  in  the  vicinity  of  Rinaldi  Street  and 
Wilbur  Avenue  (2)  in  Granada  Hills.  The  epicenter 
of  this  event  was  beneath  the  Mission  anticline  at  a 
depth  of  2  km  (a  mile  and  a  quarter),  about  2.4  km 
(a  mile  and  a  half)  to  the  northeast  of  the  above  inter- 
section (Allen,  personal  communication,  1972).  The 
magnitude  was  4.6  as  reported  by  the  California  Insti- 
tute of  Technoiog\-.  Ground  cracks  opened  in  older 
alluvium  south  of  Rinaldi  Street  in  the  vicinity  of 
Yolanda  .Avenue,  where  two  houses  were  severely 
damaged;   cracks   opened   bet\veen    bedrock   and    fill 


north  of  Rinaldi  Street  along  Volanda  Avenue.  Sev- 
eral two-story,  single-famil_\'  dwellings  on  Twin  Hills 
.■\ venue,  about  1.6  km  (a  mile)  northwest  of  the 
Rinaldi  Street-Wilbur  Avenue  corner,  required  ex- 
tensive repairs  to  dry-wall  interior  finish  and  brick 
chimneys.  In  addition,  some  cracks  that  opened  dur- 
ing the  February  9  earthquake  were  reactivated  during 
this  aftershock.  Surface  effects  of  the  aftershock 
appear  to  lie  along  the  general  strend  of  the  Devon- 
shire fault  zone  as  projected  southeast  beneath 
alluvium. 

.\t  the  Darby  Street  Elementary  School  (1), 
about  1.6  km  (a  mile)  southeast  of  the  Rinaldi  Street- 
Wilbur  Avenue  intersection,  the  blacktop  in  the  school 
yard  was  compressed.  The  principal  manifestation  of 
the  compression  consisted  of  arcuate  folds,  convex 
toward  the  east  and  southeast,  as  much  as  10  cm  (4 
inches)  high  and  about  1.5  m  (5  feet)  from  crest  to 
crest.  These  wave-like  folds  formed  in  r\vo  groups. 
The  larger  group — three  wcll-devciopcd  folds  and  one 
low  indistinct  fold  with  a  Ku  lal  extent  of  about  1 5  m 
(50  feet) — formed  about  39  m  (130  feet)  northwest 
of  the  southeast  corner  of  the  school  yard.  The  second 
group — two  lower,  less  distinct  folds  of  slightly  less 
lateral  extent — lay  on  a  line  with  the  larger  group 
and  about  30  m  (100  feet)  north  of  it.  The  school 
buildings  sustained  only  minor  damage. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Except  for  limited,  coincidental  response  to  the 
Februar\-  9  earthquake  at  its  east  end,  the  Santa  Susana 
fault  probably  has  been  inactive  since  the  middle 
Pleistocene.  The  faults  most  active  during  the  earth- 
quake cannot  be  equated  to  the  Santa  Susana  fault  in 
time  or  space;  however,  the  Santa  Susana  fault  zone 
appears  to  have  caused  increased  ground  motion  in  and 
near  the  area  of  its  outcrop  by  serving  as  a  surface  of 
reflection  and  refraction  of  seismic  waves. 

Late  Quaternary  uplift  of  the  west  end  of  the 
San  Gabriel  Alountains  appears  to  extend,  or  at  least 
to  have  affected,  rocks,  structures,  and  stream  courses 
as  much  as  2.4  to  3.2  km  (a  mile  and  a  half  to  2  miles) 
west  of  the  Van  Norman  Reservoirs.  The  San  Fer- 
nando earthquake  is  the  latest  event  in  this  uplift. 

The  Devonshire  and  Northridge  Hills  faults,  lying 
en  echelon  and  west  of  the  Februar\-  9  break,  have 
been  sites  of  Late  Quaternar)'  displacement  and  prob- 
abl\-  are  active. 

Evidence  from  detailed  geologic  mapping  suggests 
that  the  Sunshine  Ranch  "Member"  should  soon  be 
elevated  to  tlic  rank  of  foijihition  and  that  at  least  one 
new  member  should  be  recognized  at  the  top  of  tlie 
Saugus  Formation. 


CHAPTER  6 


Surface  Effects  and  Related  Geology  of  the 
San  Fernando  Earthquake  in  the  Sylmar  Area 


by  F.  Harold  Weber,  Jr.' 


ABSTRACT 

Most  of  the  economic  loss  from  the  earthquake  oc- 
curred in  the  Sylmar  area.  This  loss  was  due  partly  to  the 
surface  effects  of  faulting,  partly  to  ground  shaking,  and 
partly  to  a  combination  of  faulting  and  shaking.  The  prin- 
cipal surface  effects  of  faulting  occurred  on  the  San  Fer- 
nando fault  zone,  along  the  south  edge  of  the  Sylmar 
inlier  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley. 

Minor  surface  effects  of  the  earthquake  occurred 
along  the  Santa  Susana  fault  zone  southwest  and  north- 
east of  San  Fernando  Pass.  There  was  small  left-lateral 
and  reverse  displacement  along  the  lower  Santa  Susana 
fault  northeast  of  the  pass  for  at  least  450  m  (1500  feet). 
Here  the  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  of  the  Saugus  Forma- 
tion of  Plio-PIeistocene  age  was  faulted  south  over  the 
upper  member  of  that  formation.  Shattered  ridges  to  the 
north  of  the  fault  suggest  that  intense  ground  shaking  oc- 
curred in  the  area. 

Detailed  mapping  east  of  Grapevine  Canyon  dis- 
closed a  series  of  thrust  faults  which  apparently  place 
succeedingly  older  rock  units  over  younger  ones,  from 
Pacoima  Formation  of  middle  Pleistocene  age  at  the  base 
to  basement  complex  of  pre-Tertiary  age  at  the  top.  There 
were  minor  surface  breaks  along  tension(?)  faults  north  of 
the  eastern  lower  Santa  Susana  fault  which  extends  con- 
cealed along  the  front  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  from 
Sombrero  Canyon  to  the  Olive  View  Hospital  area.  Pre- 
earthquake  reverse  displacement  along  this  fault  of  the 
surface  on  which  the  marine  Towsley  Formation  (late  Mio- 
cene-early Pliocene)  was  deposited  may  be  greater  than 
3.5  km  (2  miles).  Northwest  of  the  Olive  View  Hospital 
complex,  there  were  minor  surface  effects  along  the  east- 
ern lower  Santa  Susana  fault  and  possibly  along  the  Olive 
View  fault.  These  faults  respectively  place  undifferentiated 
Towsley/Pico  Formations  over  Pacoima  Formation  and 
Pacoima  Formation  over  older  alluvium  of  late(?)  Pleisto- 
cene age.  The  Olive  View  Hospital  complex  probably  was 
damaged  principally  by  ground  shaking.  An  east-north- 
east-trending fault  may  extend  concealed  beneath  alluvium 
along  the  front  of  the  foothills  there.  If  activity  occurred 
along  the  fault  at  depth,  perhaps  shaking  was  amplified 
at  the  surface  in  the  vicinity  of  the  hospital. 

Ground  cracks  and  sand  boils  developed  in  the  north- 
western Sylmar  area,  accompanied  by  severe  damage  to 
the  San  Fernando  Juvenile  Hall,  Golden  State  Freeway, 
Pacific  intertie  Terminal,  and  other  facilities.  Strong  curvi- 
linear cracks  in  alluvium  northeast  of  the  Juvenile  Hall 
extend  southwest.  Their  development  accompanied  settling,

lurching,  and  possible  sliding  along  wet,  fine  sandy  layers 
which  liquefied  during  shaking.  Similar  ground  cracks  were 
also  common  for  0.8  km  (half  a  mile)  north  and  northeast 
of  the  Juvenile  Hall,  and  were  well  developed  1.6  km  (1 
mile)  to  the  west.  Branch  faults  of  the  Santa  Susana  zone 
may  project  northeast  through  the  Juvenile  Hall  area,  and 
activity  along  these  faults  beneath  the  surface  of  alluvium 
may  have  amplified  shaking  in  the  area. 

The  San  Fernando  fault  zone  extends  east-northeast 
into  the  Mission  Hills  through  the  site  of  Lower  San  Fer- 
nando Dam,  part  of  which  failed  by  sliding  north  into  Van 
Norman  Reservoir  (see  Cortright,  this  Bulletin).  No  fault 
rupture  is  known  to  extend  into  the  dam.  The  Reservoir 
segment  of  the  fault  zone  is  the  name  used  in  this  report 
for  the  complex  of  faults  northeast  of  the  dam  site.  The 
principal  fault  break  of  the  segment  was  wholly  in  arti- 
ficial cuts  in  the  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  of  the  Saugus 
Formation,  'i  trends  east,  dips  north,  and  is  300  m  (1000 
feet)  long;  it  shows  left-lateral  and  reverse  offsets. 

The  Mission  Wells  and  Sylmar  segments  of  the  San 
Fernando  fault  zone  trend  east-northeast  in  alluvium 
through  heavily  populated  portions  of  Sylmar.  Spectacular 
ground  rupture  and  accompanying  fault  breaks  formed  a 
swath  perhaps  360  m  (1200  feet)  wide  and  demonstrated 
large  left-lateral,  normal  (vertical),  and  shortening  (thrust) 
components  of  fault  movement.  The  faults  dip  about  50°- 
60°N.,  essentially  parallel  to  bedding  of  the  succession  of 
Modelo  Formation,  Towsley/Pico  Formations,  and  Saugus 
Formation,  which  lie  mostly  beneath  a  veneer  of  alluvium. 

Pre-earthquake  scarps  along  the  Sylmar  and  Mission 
Wells  segments  are  delineated  topographically  on  the  old 
San  Fernando  topographic  quadrangle  maps  of  the  U.  S. 
Geological  Survey.  A  fault  north  of  the  Sylmar  segment, 
with  a  scarp  also  delineated  topographically,  is  exposed 
in  the  Foothill  Freeway.  Although  only  slightly  active  dur- 
ing the  earthquake,  it  shows  older  alluvium  on  the  north 
faulted  up  perhaps  30  m  (100  feet)  or  more.  Apparently 
none  of  these  faults  was  mapped  before  the  earthquake. 

The  earthquake  caused  damage  away  from  areas  of 
obvious  fault  rupture  in  the  gently  sloping  Sylmar  area. 
The  damage  is  assumed  to  hove  been  caused  by  ground 
shaking.  Some  street  cracks  may  be  parallel  to  bedding- 
plane  faults  in  the  Saugus  Formation  which  is  assumed  to 
underlie  the  alluvium. 

Study  of  the  surface  geologic  effects  of  the  earth- 
quake and  of  the  areal  geology  in  the  Sylmar  area  shows 
a  complex  relationship  between  faulting,  ground  shaking, 
and  damage.  Better  understanding  of  the  geologic  en- 
vironment and  its  probable  response  to  future  earthquakes 
is  necessary  for  wise  future  land-use  and  building  design.

As  used  here,  the  Sylmar  area  includes  most  of  the 
conimunitv  of  Sylmar  iii  the  city  of  Los  Angeles  along 
with  the  cir\-  of  San  Fcrnaiuio  and  adjoining  portions 
of  Los  Angeles  Count&gt;-  in  tlic  San  Gabriel  Mountains 
and  foothills.  Most  of  the  structures  damaged  in  the 
earthquake  were  in  this  area,  as  follows:  water  storage 
and  electrical  transmission  and  conversion  facilities  of 
the  Los  Angeles  Cit&gt;'  Department  of  Water  and 
Power;  facilities  under  construction  for  Metropolitan 
Water  District  of  Southern  California;  Los  Angeles 
County  Olive  View  Hospital;  dams  and  other  facilities 
of  the'  Los  Angeles  Count)-  Flood  Control  District; 
Golden  State,  Foothill,  and' San  Diego  Freeways;  San 
Fernando  and  Svlmar  Industrial  Parks;  Holy  Cross 
Hospital;  Indian'  Hills  Medical  Center;  and  a  large 
number  of  commercial  and  apartment  buildings, 
schools,  single-family  dwellings,  underground  utility 
lines,  and  streets. 

The  damage  occurred  almost  \\holIy  within  about 
15  seconds  of  fhe  initial  shock  at  6:01  a.m.  on  February 
9,  1971.  The  resultant  geologic  effects  ranged  from 
slight  to  spectacular,  witli  tlie  range  of  damage  at 
each  construction  .site  or  localitv'  being  dependent 
upon  its  particular  relationship  to  these  geologic  ef- 
fects. It  is  the  purpose  of  this  report  to  describe  the 
geologic  effects  and  to  relate  them  generally  to  the 
damage.  In  contrast,  there  have  been  numerous  studies 
made  of  individual  sites  where  damage  occurred,  and 
many  reports  have  been  written  covering  specialized 
topics  of  the  geology  and  seismology  of  the  earthquake 
(consolidated  references,  tiiis  Bulletin). 

This  report  is  based  on  neari\'  a  year's  study  in  the 
field  of  tiie  geolog\-  related  to  the  earthquake.  The 
work  began  as  a  reconnaissance  of  the  entire  region  in 
collaboration  with  colleagues  of  the  California  Division 
of  Mines  and  Geology  and  phased  into  a  detailed 
stud\-  of  the  Sylmar  area,  using  maps  of  the  scale  of 
1  inch  equals  400  feet  provided  by  the  City  of  Los 
.■\ngcles.  In  addition,  post-  and  pre-earthquake  aerial 
photographs  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  San 
Fernando  topographic  quadrangle  (1966)  were  used 
in  mapping. 

This  report  supersedes  previous  reports  (Barrows 
and  others,  1971,  and  California  Division  of  Mines  and 
Geolog\%  1971)  on  surface  effects  of  the  1971  earth- 
quake in  the  Sylmar  area  prepared  by  the  California 
Division  of  Mines  and  Geology. 

GEOLOGIC  SETTING  OF  THE  SYLMAR  AREA 
The  Sylmar  area  includes  the  very  western  part 
of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  which  are  separated 
from  the  Santa  Susana  Mountains  to  the  ^\•est  by  San 
Fernando  Pass.  The  Santa  Susana  fault  zone  bends 
northeastward  from  the  frontal  area  of  the  Santa  Su- 
sana Mountains  into  the  steep  front  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains,  but  faults  of  this  zone  broke  at  the  surface 
onl\-  minimall\-  during  the  earthquake. 

South  of  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains  lies  a  gently 
south-sloping  surface  or  plain  w  hich  is  an  inlier  of  the 
northern  part  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley.  This  sur- 
face is  separated  by  the  Mission  and  Pacoima  Hills 
from  the  major  part  of  the  valley  to  the  south.  Most 
of  the  damage  from  the  earthquake  occurred  within 
the  Sj'Imar  inlier  or  along  its  edges,  because  of  the 


proximit\-  of  the  epicenter  to  the  concentration   of 
people  and  construction  there. 

At  the  south  edge  of  this  inlier  lies  the  western 
part  of  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone,  the  principal  zone 
of  faulting  involved  in  the  earthquake.  This  zone  was 
not  recognized  in  the  Sylmar  area  before  the  earth- 
quake, although  portions  of  it  had  been  mapped,  espe- 
cialK-  in  the  Lower  Van  Norman  Reservoir  area  by 
Kcw  (1924).  Union  Oil  Companv  (1953),  Bailev  and 
Jahns  (1954),  Jennings  (1957),  and  Oakeshott  (1958). 
in  addition,  an  impediment  to  the  southward  flow  of 
ground  water  out  of  the  Sylmar  area,  as  described  by 
California  State  Water  Rights  Roard  (1962),  is  essen- 
tially along  faults  of  the  San  Fernando  zone  (Brown, 
this  Bulletin).  Faults  of  the  zone  may  extend  south- 
westward  froiu  the  Sylmar  area  at  least  as  far  as 
Chatsworth  in  the  very  \\estern  part  of  the  San  Fer- 
nando Valley;  to  the  east,  they  extend  to  Sunland,. 
where  they  join  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone.  Three 
segments  of  surface  breaks  were  named  during  studies 
immediately  after  the  earthquake  by  geologists  of 
California  Institute  of  Technoloev  (Kamb  and  others, 
1971)  and  the  U.  S.  Geologicaf  Survey  Staff  (1971). 
These  are  the  Mission  Wells,  Sylmar,  and  Tujunga 
segments.  One  additional  segment,  the  Lakeview.  was 
defined  by  the  California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geol- 
ogy (Barrows  and  others,  1971,  and  this  Bulletin).  A 
fifth  segment,  the  Reservoir, is  delineated  in  this  report. 

In  the  following  pages. the  geologic  effects  of  the 
earthquake  in  the  Sylmar  area  are  described  generally 
in  order  from  west  to  ea.st,  beginning  with  the  Santa 
Susana  fault  zone  in  the  San  Fernando  Pass  area  and 
extending  east  and  southeast  to  the  eastern  end  of  the 
Sylmar  segment  of  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone  near 
the  Pacoima  Wash. 

GEOLOGY  AND  SURFACE  EFFEaS 
IN  THE  SYLMAR  AREA 

Santa  Susana  Fault  Zone 

The  Santa  Susana  fault  zone  extends  northeastward 
from  the  Santa  Susana  .Mountains  across  San  Fernando 
Pass  and  into  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains.  Faults  of  the 
zone  extend  eastward  along  the  front  of  the  mountains 
to  the  vicinity  of  Olive  View  Hospital.  Such  faults  as 
the  Sombrero  seem  to  split  from  the  zone  and  trend 
toward  the  north-northeast  into  the  range.  Also  in- 
cluded in  the  zone  arc  probable  concealed  faults  that 
extend  northeastward  across  the  \"an  Nomian  Reser- 
voir area  to  the  vicinity  of  Olive  \^iew,  where  the 
Olive  View  fault  is  exposed.  The  area  of  these  con- 
cealed faults  is  described  in  a  later  section  of  this  re- 
port. 

Sa)i  Fernando  Pass  area.  The  Santa  Susana  fault 
zone  in  the  San  Fernando  Pa.ss  area  consi.sts  of  two 
principal  faults,  which  are  referred  to  as  the  lower  and 
the  upper  Santa  Susana  faults  (photo  1).  The  trace  of 
the  lower  fault,  both  southwest  and  northeast  of  the 
pass,  was  clearly  expressed  by  the  effects  of  the  earth- 
quake. \  mole  track  and  accompanying  features  due 
to  shaking  extend  nonheastward  into  the  Sylmar  area 
from  theOat  Mountain  quadrangle  (Saul,  this  Bulle- 
tin). From  a  point  about  half  a  mile  (1  km)  south- 
southwest  of  the  pass,  a  mole  track  was  traced  north-

northeastward  across  a  swale  and  up  onto  a  flat  area 
roughly  180  m  (600  feet)  west  of  Balboa  Boulevard 
and  just  \\est  of  the  top  of  the  large  road  cut  there 
(12).  The  fault  break  extended  down  the  north  side 
of  this  hill  but  could  not  be  traced  northward  into  a 
pre-earthquake  bedrock  landslide.  No  break  was  found 
north  of  the  landslide  in  colluvium  above  the  fault  in  a 
small  canyon  or  beyond  in  fill  for  the  Golden  State 
Freeway  (plate  2);  but  it  is  in  this  area,  beneath  the 
colluvium  in  the  canyon  and  apparently  in  the  plane 
of  the  fault,  that  the  Balboa  feeder  tunnel  of  the  Met- 
ropolitan Water  District  was  severely  cracked  during 
the  earthquake  (19).  This  location  was  given  by  H. 
J.  Mills,  general  manager  of  the  District,  as  about 
1500  feet  north  of  the  south  portal  (Duke,  1971,  p. 
226).  Cracks  also  appeared  approximately  along  the 
trace  of  the  fault  in  part  of  the  freeway  and  in  the 
eastern  aqueduct  tunnel  of  the  Los  Angeles  City  De- 
partment of  Water  and  Power  beneath  the  freeway. 
The  Balboa  Boulevard  bridge,  which  crosses  the  free- 
way above  the  concealed  fault,  was  severely  damaged 
(18). 

Northeast  of  the  freeway,  a  mole  track  was  traced 
in  bedrock  at  least  450  m  (1500  feet).  At  one  locality 
(20)  along  this  trace,  steeply  dipping  to  overturned 
beds  of  the  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  of  the  Saugus 
Formation    clearly   overlie    younger,    generally    very 


gently  southeast-dipping  beds  of  tlie  upper  member 
of  the  Saugus  Formation  (photo  2).  Here  the  caliche- 
bearing  fault  trace  extends  along  a  steep  outcrop  and 
displays  left-oblique  offset  of  8  to  10  cm  (3  to  4 
inches),  although  this  figure  may  be  exaggerated 
slightl\"  by  landsliding.  The  dip  of  the  lower  Santa 
Susana  fault  is  about  20°  N.  In  this  area,  Winterer  and 
Durham  (1962,  plate  44)  mapped  the  fault  150  m  (500 
feet)  north  of  its  actual  location  and  show  the  actual 
location  as  a  depositional  contact  between  the  Sunshine 
Ranch  Member  and  the  upper  member  of  the  Saugus 
Formation.  Intense  shaking  in  the  area  is  suggested  by 
shattered  earth  on  ridsjcs,  such  as  that  located  about 
230  m  (750  feet)  north  of  (20)   (photo  3). 

Intensified  shaking  or  slight  displacement  may 
have  occurred  along  the  upper  Santa  Susana  fault  be- 
tween the  Golden  State  Freeway  and  Grapevine  Cin- 
\'on,  where  prominent  cracks  extend  across  several 
ridges  (23).  To  the  \\cst,  activity  along  this  fault  may 
have  caused  damage  to  the  aqueduct  lines  just  north 
of  the  cascades  (21).  Another  ground  crack  in  this 
area  seems  to  show  small  left-lateral  offset  along  a 
branch  of  the  Santa  Susana  fault  zone  (22). 

The  U.  S.  Geological  Survey  Staff  (1971,  p.  75) 
reported  that  no  tectonic  movement  occurred  along 
the  Santa  Susana  fault,  and  geologists  of  the  California 
Institute  of  Technolog\-  (Kamb  and  others,  1971,  p.

41-54)  did  not  discus.s  the  fault  zone.  Nevertheless, 
.Mcehan  (1971,  p.  241)  noted  that  movement  occurred 
on  the  fault.  The  surface  breaks  of  the  Santa  Susana 
fault  zone  in  the  San  Fernando  Pass  area  extended 
generally  along  a  part  of  the  western  edge  of  the 
Chatsworth  segment  of  the  aftershock  area,  as  shown 
by  Hanks  and  others  (1971,  p.  21-23,  figure  1).  Per- 
haps several  of  these  aftershocks,  reported  to  have 
occurred  at  depths  of  9-11  km  (5V:-7  miles),  may 
have  occurred  down  dip  from  the  surface  breaks  of 
the  fault  zone. 

Grapevine  Canyon-Soi7ibrero  Canyon  area.  In 
the  northeast  fork  of  Grapevine  Canyon,  cracks  oc- 
curred in  alluvium  and  fill,  and  one  slight  break  may 
have  occurred  along  a  fault  of  the  zone  just  north  of  a 
ranch  house  which  was  severely  damaged  and  later 
razed  (24).  In  addition,  breaks  occurred  in  a  major 
gas  line  that  extends  through  the  area,  but  the  ground 
along  the  traces  of  faults  was  not  examined  thoroughly 
soon  enough  after  the  earthquake  to  determine 
whether  ground  cracks  here  were  directly  related  to 
faulting.  One  mole  track  in  the  area  extended  north- 
northwest  down  a  hill  slope  for  50  m  (160  feet),  en- 
tirel&gt;-  within  the  upper  member  of  the  Saugus  Forma- 
tion, where  shattered  ridges  and  landslides  are 
common;  but  it  does  not  seem  to  be  part  of  a  through- 
going  f"ult  (25). 

The  Grapevine  fault  (Oakeshott,  1958)  is  a  re- 
verse fault  which  separates  basement  complex  from 
the  Towslcy  and  Pico  Formations.  This  and  addi- 
tional faults  in  the  area  also  have  been  mapped  by 
Hollowav  (1940),  Mcrificld  (1958),  and  Winterer  and 


Durham  (1962).  The  Grapevine  fault  was  examined 
for  signs  of  activity'  after  the  earthquake,  but  none 
was  discovered  (plate  2).  Possible  minor,  prc-carth- 
quake  faulting  occurred  in  the  very  southwest  part  of 
Pleistocene  terrace  deposits  (Pacoima  Formation?) 
north  of  the  east  fork  of  Grapevine  Canyon;  but  the 
Grapevine  fault  does  not  seem  to  offset  these  deposits. 

The  Santa  Susana  fault  zone  continues  east  from 
the  upper  part  of  the  northeast  fork  of  Grapevine 
Canyon  to  the  Olive  View  Hospital  area.  Features  as- 
sociated with  shaking  and  possible  small  displacements 
occurred  during  the  earthquake  along  faults  of  this 
zone  in  partial  reflection  of  the  very  complicated,  pre- 
existing fault  pattern.  Faults  are  very  difficult  to  map 
in  this  area  because  of  this  complexity',  and  because  the 
lithology  of  late  Miocene  to  middle  Pleistocene  clastic 
sedimentary  rocks  (the  Towsley,  Pico,  Saugus,  and 
Pacoima  Formations)  commonly  changes  so  gradualK' 
and  subtly  that  division  and  recognition  of  mappable 
units  is  very  difficult.  Furthermore,  many  outcrops  arc 
severely  weathered  and  thus  difficult  to  study,  and 
older  alluvium  conceals  man\-  parts  of  faults. 

In  the  Oat  Mountain  area  to  the  west,  oil  ^vell  data 
from  the  Aliso  Can\on  field  indicate  that  the  lower 
Santa  Susana  fault  has  an  apparent  fold  in  it  (Holston, 
1952).  Similar  folding  or  bcnding-ovcr  may  have  oc- 
curred along  the  fault  zone  here,  further  complicating 
the  structural  picture. 

The  present  mapping  demonstrates  that,  in  the 
area  between  the  cast  fork  of  Grapevine  Canyon  and 
the  vicinity  of  Sombrero  Canyon,  development  of  a 
series   of  thrust   faults   has   placed   older   rock  units

successively  over  younger  units  (plate  2).  At  the  base 
of  the  series,  fractured  and  sheared  Sunshine  Ranch 
Member  of  tiie  Saugus  Formation  is  partially  thrust 
over  Pacoima  Formation  or  older  alluvium;  next,  un- 
differentiated Towsley/Pico  Formations  are  thrust 
over  the  Sunshine  Ranch  .Member;  and  at  the  top  of 
the  sequence  lies  gneiss  of  the  basement  complex  which 
is  brecciatcd  along  tJie  fault  contact  but  retains  its 
lithologic  character  at  the  top,  giving  the  appearance 
of  a  possible  gravity  fault  of  tectonic  origin,  rather 
than  that  of  a  landslide.  The  lowermost  and  most 
soutiierly  fault,  as  partly  projected  from  Grapevine 
Canyon  to  tlie  Olive  \'iew  area,  is  temied  the  eastern 
lower  Santa  Susana  fault  (plate  2).  No  evidence  was 


discovered  for  the  south-trending  San  Fernando  fault 
as  mapped  by  iMerifield  (1958). 

Geologic  surface  effects  of  the  earthquake  in  this 
area  were  limited  mostly  to  landsliding.  One  group  of 
small  breaks,  up  on  the  south  side,  extends  across  a 
ridge  north-northeast  of  Yarnell  Street  and  the  Foot- 
hill Freeway  (30).  These  cracks  imply  breaking  along 
a  northeast-trending,  high-angle  fault  which  seemed  to 
cut  across  the  thrust  sequence  (plate  2). 

Surface  breaks  occurred  along  faults  west  of  Som- 
brero Ranch  house,  which  was  extensively  damaged 
during  the  earthquake.  The  principal  activity  was 
along  a  segment  of  a  fault  that  strikes  east  and  varies 
in  dip  along  strike  from  moderately  north  to  steeply

south  (plate  2).  The  north  side  of  this  fault  moved  up 
a  maximum  of  about  5  cm  (2  inches)  relative  to  the 
south  side  across  one  ridge  crest  (31). 

Sovibrero  Canyon  to  Olive  Vicu;  Hospital  area. 
Additional  faulting  occurred  to  the  cast  toward  Olive 
\'^iew  Hospital,  along  the  projected  trace  of  the  east- 
ern Santa  Susana  fault  zone  at  the  base  of  the  steep 
front  of  the  mountains.  The  To\\slc\'  Formation  ap- 
parcntl&gt;'  is  overturned  progressively  to  a  point  at  the 
edge  of  tiic  mountains  where  it  dips  25°  N.,  suggesting 
that  the  fault  beneath  it  has  a  very  gentle  dip  (plates 
2  and  5).  To  the  north,  the  surface  on  which  the  late 
.Miocene  and  early  Pliocene  marine  .sediments*  of  the 
TowsIe\'  Formation  were  deposited  extends  northeast, 
up  along  the  side  of  the  mountains  to  the  north  at 
least  as  high  as  2700  feet,  indicating  that  uplift  of  this 
early  Pliocene  marine  shoreline  has  been  about  900  m 
(.^000  feet)  in  the  \\estcrn  San  Gabriel  Mountains 
north  of  Olive  \'icw  since  early  Pliocene  time. 

The  site  of  the  Sunray  Oil  Company  exploratory 
oil  well,  Stetson-Sombrero  1,  is  south  of  the  fault 
(plate  2).  This  well  was  drilled  to  a  depth  of  12,027 
feet  in  nonmarinc  sedimentar\-  rocks,  probably  mostly 
of  the  Saugus  Formation.  Perhaps  these  rocks  were 
deposited  to  such  great  thickness  in  a  synclinal  trough 
along  the  front  of  the  range  which  had  begun  to 
develop  in  early-middle?  Pleistocene  time.  The  trough 
may  be  represented  now  by  a  concealed  link  between 
the  .Mission  Hills  and  iMerrick  synclincs  (plate  2).  It 
is  probable  that  the  section  may  be  exaggerated  in 
thickness  by  faulting.  .\  possible  structural  relation- 
ship here  is  shown  in  cross-section  A- A'  (plate  5).  It 
suggests  that  the  surface  on  which  the  Towsley  For- 
mation was  deposited  has  been  displaced  at  least 
.^.5  km  (more  than  2  miles)  to  the  south  by  reverse 
faulting  (thrusting). 

Offsets  of  younger,  Pleistocene  features  are  not 
so  easy  to  detect.  It  is  possible  that,  if  terrace-like  de- 
posits of  older  alluvium  at  the  1750-foot  level  in  the 
mountains  arc  equivalent  to  the  lower  part  of  the 
Pacoima  Formation  (as  in  the  Wilson  Canyon  area), 
reverse  offset  of  the  base  of  this  formation  is  at  least 
225m  (750  feet).  To  distinguisii  among  the  Qua- 
ternary nonmarinc  rock  units  is  difficult  because  of 
the  \ariabilit\'  of  ]itholog\'  and  the  probable  discon- 
formitx'  of  contacts.  For  example,  north  of  the  west- 
ern end  of  Olive  View,  the  Pacoima  Formation  is 
composed  mostly  of  constituents  derived  from 
the  TowsIe\-  Formation  which  caps  the  basement  com- 
plex to  the  north.  In  poor  outcrops,  the  Pacoima  For- 
mation is  similar  to  the  Towsley  Formation.  Deep 
weathering  in  exposures  of  uplifted  former  surfaces, 
such  as  just  north  of  Olive  \'ie\\',  causes  pebbly  con- 
glomerate of  different  units  to  look  very  similar.  In 
addition,  the  marine-nonmarinc  boundary  between 
Pico  Formation  and  Saugus  Formation  may  transgress 
upwarti  from  southwest  to  northeast,  further  compli- 
cating interpretation  of  structure. 

To  the  east,  in  the  Wilson  Canyon  area,  the  Pa- 
coima Formation  is  derived  mostly  from  dioritic  gneiss 
and  related  basement  rocks;  therefore,  it  is  practically

identical  to  jounger  units  of  similarly  derived  older 
alluvium  (Barrows,  this  Bulletin). 

Steeply  dipping  tension  faults  lie  to  the  north  of 
the  concealed  trace  of  the  eastern  lower  Santa  Susana 
fault  between  Sombrero  Canyon  and  the  Olive  \'iew 
Hospital  area.  One  such  fault  between  Sombrero  and 
Hog  Canyons  was  active  during  the  earthquake  (32). 
Further  to  the  east,  fault-like  cracks  cut  the  crests  of 
three  adjacent  ridges  just  north  of  the  eastern  lower 
Santa  Susana  fault  (33).  These  breaks  may  be  similar 
to  stronger  breaks  north  of  the  principal  reverse 
faults  of  the  Tujunga  and  Lakeview  segments  to  the 
east  (plate  3),  but  no  conformable  breaks  were  found 
along  the  apparent  trace  of  the  eastern  lower  Santa 
Susana  fault  in  this  vicinity. 

Continuing  casr«  ard  toward  Olive  View,  a  well- 
defined  reverse  fault  dipping  about  45°  N.  across  the 
ridge  west  of  Schoolhouse  Canyon  clearl\-  has  placed 
contorted  rocks  of  probable  Pico  Formation  of  Middle 
Pliocene  age  over  \ounger  north-dipping  Pacoima  For- 
mation of  probable  middle  Pleistocene  age  (34).  Cross 
fractures,  slight  upward  bowing,  and  landsliding  along 
the  fault  on  the  west  side  of  the  canyon  suggest,  at 
least,  that  shaking  was  intensified  along  it  (photo  4). 
The  fault  extends  across  a  powerline  road  cut  in  bed- 
rock along  the  ridge  crest  here,  but  the  road  had  been 
regraded  before  it  was  observed  the  day  after  the 
earthquake  b\'  Allan  G.  Barrows;  and  it  is  not  known 
whether  displacement  occurred  in  the  road. 

The  area  from  Schoolhouse  Canyon  east  to  Wilson 
Can\on,  north  of  Olive  View,  was  mapped  slightly 
differently  from  Merificld  (1958)  or  as  adapted  by 
Jahns  and  others  (1968)  and  Proctor  and  others 
(1972).  The  present  mapping  resembles  more  closely 
that  of  Union  Oil  Company  (1953).  Along  the  east 
side  of  Schoolhouse  Canyon,  fossilifcrous  sandstone, 
probabl\-  of  the  Pico  Formation,  is  clearl\-  thrust  over 
Pacoima  Formation;  and  intense  landsliding  along  the 
fault  suggests  that  it  was  active  here  in  1971  or  that 
shaking  was  intensified.  Further  east,  a  small  fault 
break  extends  45  m  (150  feet)  over  two  ridges;  this 
fault  strikes  east,  dips  75°  S.,  and  on  the  eastern  end 
brings  Towsle\-  or  Pico  Formation  up  over  older 
alluvium  or  Pacoima  Formation  (36).  .Maximum  meas- 
urable displacement  in  the  earthquake  was  about  2  cm 
(O.R  inch)   (photo  5). 

The  principal  north-dipping  fault  continues  east- 
ward and  northeastward,  apparently  at  least  to  a  point 
near  where  a  relatively  new  water  tank,  partly  on  fill, 
was  severe!)-  shaken  and  damaged  (38).  This  fault  was 
mapped  as  the  northeast  segment  of  the  Olive  View 
fault  by  Alerifield  (1958);  but,  for  this  report,  the 
segment  is  considered  as  the  easternmost  part  of  the 
lower  Santa  Susana  fault.  The  fault  may  die  out  in  bed- 
ding of  the  Pacoima  Formation  or  beneath  alluvium. 
To  the  northwest  of  the  tank,  faults  trend  north  to 
northeast,  similar  to  the  Sombrero  fault  and  others  that 
angle  off  into  the  basement  complex  (plate  2).  The 
nearl&gt;-  continuous  trend  of  a  zone  of  marble  layers  of 
the  Placerita  Formation  into  this  area  from  at  least  2 
miles  to  the  northwest  suggests  that  only  small  offsets 
occur  along  these  north-  to  northwest-trending  faults. 

The  name  Olive  View  fault  is  applied  to  the 
fault  zone  that  lies  bervveen  the  eastern  lower  Santa

Susana  fault  and  the  most  northwesterly  buildings  of 
the  Olive  View  Hospital  comple.x  (plate  2).  This  fault 
zone  is  best  exposed  in  Schoolhouse  Canyon  and  just 
west  of  Wilson  Canvon.  Between  the  canyons,  the 
principal  fault  is  best  defined  as  a  vegetational  linea- 
ment visible  on  aerial  photographs.  All  along  its  trace, 
this  fault  has  such  suggestions  of  earthquake  activity 
as  thin  cracks  across  ridge  tops,  a  bent  pipe  where  the 
fault  apparently  extends  into  Wilson  Dam,  and  cracks 
across  asphalt  pavement  and  in  the  Olive  \'iew  laundry 
building  (plate  3).  At  the  southwestern  end,  a  small 
fault  on  the  east  side  of  Schoolhouse  Canyon  shows 
slight  displacement,  and  several  cracks  that  extend  for 
about  60  m  (200  feet)  southwest  of  the  canyon  may 
be  along  a  southwest  extension  of  a  fault  of  this  zone 
(35).  Where  best  exposed  in  Schoolhouse  Canyon  and 
just  west  of  Wilson  Canyon,  faults  of  the  Olive  View- 
fault  zone  dip  moderately  to  steeply  north,  with  Pa- 
coima Formation  on  the'  north  side  overriding  older 
alluvium  on  the  south  side  (plates  2  and  5).  Both  the 
Schoolhouse  Canyon  and  Wilson  Canyon  Dams  were 
damaged  during  the  earthquake.  The  area  of  Wilson 
Canyon  and  to  the  east  is  described  in  this  Bulletin 
by  Barrows.

Olive  Vieiv  Hospital  area.  The  badi&gt;-  damaged 
Olive  View  Hospital  complex  lies  at  the  southern 
edge  of  the  foothills  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains, 
partl\'  on  alluvium  and  partly  on  artificial  fill  (plate 
2).  There  are  known  faults  in  the  vicinit\',  especially 
in  the  foothills  tf)  the  north  f)f  most  of  the  buildings; 
and  it  is  possible  that  intensified  shaking  and  small 
displacements  ma&gt;-  have  occurred  along  some  of  them 
during  the  earthquake  (as  discussed  previously).  It  is 
not  clear  \\  hcther  faults  arc  present  immediatcl&gt;'  south 
of  the  foothills;  but  a  topographic  scarp  along  the 
hills  just  to  the  south  of  the  most  easterly  buildings 
cast  of  Wilson  Canvon,  witli  Pacoima  Formation  and 
older  alluvium  seeminglv  uplifted  to  the  north,  gives 
the  appearance  of  a  fault  scarp  or  fault-line  scarp 
(Barrows,  this  Bulletin). 

No  definite  evidence  was  found  to  show  that  a 
fault  lies  here  although  ground  cracks  (up  slightly 
on  the  north)  east  of  tiie  east  parking  lot  (lot  J)  of 
the  main  hospital  building  ma\-  represent  surface  ex- 
pression of  possible  faulting  (40)  (photo  6).  However, 
a  south-trending  magnetometer  traverse  here  revealed 
only  a  ver\"  small  magnetic  anomah',  and  a  traverse 
several  hundred  feet  to  the  cast  showed  no  anomaly 
suggestive  of  a  buried  fault  scarp,  as  is  common  across 
know  n  fault  scarps  ciscw  here  in  the  earthquake  area 
(Chapman  and  Chase,  this  Bulletin). 

The  new  Olive  Wqw  Hospital  buildings  were 
designed  in  1964  to  meet  earthquake  code  changes  of 
that  year.  Construction  was  completed  in  1970.  All 
four  buildings  were  badl\-  damaged:  The  main  build- 
ing, which  moved  slightl\'  north  and  cast,  \\as  severely 
damaged,  with  three  of  its  four  stairwells  falling  over; 
and  the  psychiatric  building  moved  south  and  east  (a 
walled  embankment  lay  to  its  north)  and  collapsed. 

The  buildings  were  constructed  partly  on  artificial 
fill  and  partly  on  &gt;ounger  alluvium,  which  is  probably 
more  than  .^6  m  (100  feet)  deep  at  the  mouth  of  Wil- 
son Can\on  (plate  2).  The  younger  alluvium  consists 
of  relativeh'  coarse,  essentiall\'  unconsolidated  sand 
and  gravel  deposited  by  the  stream  in  Wilson  Canyon 
before  a  flood  control  dam  was  built  there.  The  fill 
on  which  the  main  hospital  building  was  constructed 
seems  to  have  failed  at  least  partially  (photo  7).  Many 
tensional  and  compressional  cracks  and  other  surface 
features  developed  in  asphalted  areas  and  over  such 
buried  structures  as  the  cast-west  .Maclay  High  (wa- 
ter) Line  aqueduct  of  the  Los  Angeles  Cit\-  Depart- 
ment of  Water  and  Power.  These  features  were 
mapped  by  James  E.  Kahle  and  .■\llan  G.  Barrows  in 
March  1971  and  are  shown  in  the  vicinity  north  of 
(39). 

.Most  investigators  have  concluded  that  the  build- 
ings at  Olive  View  were  damaged  by  strong  ground 
motion  and  not  by  faulting.  Regarding  the  main  build- 
ing, Frazier  and  others  (1971,  p.  142)  stated  that  it 
is  ".  .  .  doubtful  if  the  hospital  could  have  taken 
another  5  seconds  of  shaking."  \Vhether  one  or  more 
faults  extend  east-northeastward  or  west-north\vest- 
ward  through  or  beneath  the  new  hospital  area  is 
speculative  as  far  as  present  knowledge  is  concerned. 
F'.ven  if  sucli  faults  do  exist,  it  is  speculative  whether 
even    slight    displacement   at    depth    did    occur    and

whether  displacement  or  other  activit&gt;'  did  enhance 
or  exaggerate  ground  shaking  at  the  surface  in  the 
area.  Monitoring  of  aftershocks  in  the  earthquake  area 
was  attempted  by  Warrick  and  Joyner  (1971,  p.  91- 
96)  to  determine  the  degree  of  shaking  in  different 
rock  types,  but  results  were  only  partiall_\-  successful. 
It  seems  reasonable,  however,  that  shaking  of  fill  or 
unconsolidated  younger  alluvium  would  be  relatively 
greater  than  consolidated  or  cemented  sedimentary 
deposits. 

Small,  older  buildings  north  of  the  new  buildings 
were  constructed  mostly  on  younger  alluvium.  Most 
were  not  damaged  extensively  and  still  arc  usable. 
Older  buildings  in  the  western  area  were  constructed 
partly  on  older  alluvium,  partly  on  fill  derived  from 
older  alluvium,  and  partly  on  younger  alluvium  (37). 
Although  it  is  difficult  to  distinguish  the  exact  bound- 
aries of  these  three  types  of  material  here,  areas  of  fill 
seem  to  have  been  especially  susceptible  to  failure  by 
sliding,  presumably  caused  by  shaking.  Fills  for  the 
Foothill  Freeway  in  the  area  also  failed  by  sliding 
caused  by  shaking. 

Southeast  of  the  Olive  View  area  is  a  zone  com- 
prised of  two  segments  of  relatively  strong  street 
cracks  and  lesser  ground  cracks,  which  extends  south- 
east in  alluvium  for  about  1  km  (3300  feet)  from  just 
southeast  of  Bledsoe  Street  to  Polk  Street  (41).  The 
zone  is  interpreted  as  a  possible  fault  break  which  may 
follow  the  trend  of  bedding  of  the  Saugus  Formation 
beneath  the  alluvium.  The  zone  is  nearly  parallel  to 
the  strike  of  the  r\vo  closest  exposures  of  the  Saugus 
Formation  to  the  north  and  south  (plate  2).  The  zone 
lies  along  the  northern  edge  of  a  small,  northwest- 
trending  secondary  bulge  in  the  generally  west-trend- 
ing zone  of  maximum  change  in  elevation  during  the 
earthquake  (figure  3).  Houses  along  the  zone  were 
damaged. 

Geologic  evidence  does  not  seem  to  indicate  that 
a  zone  of  intensified  shaking  lies  specifically  along  the 
front  of  the  San  Gabriel  Alountains  from  the  Olive 
\^iew  Hospital  area  east  to  the  \^eterans  Administra- 
tion Hospital  area.  As  has  been  proposed  elsewhere, 
such  a  zone  would  extend  east  from  Olive  View 
through  the  area  of  Almetz  and  Aldergrove  Streets 
where  houses  were  badly  damaged  (see  also  Stein- 
brugge,  this  Bulletin)  (43),  but  the  severe  damage 
here  was  to  split-level  houses  ^\•ith  bedroom-over- 
garage  plan  (Slosson,  this  Bulletin;  Steinbruggc,  this 
Bulletin);  and  split-level  houses  also  were  badly  dam- 
aged on  Fenton  Avenue  between  Tyler  and  Polk 
Streets  (42),  which  is  about  a  quarter  to  half  a  mile 
south  of  the  mountains  and  south  of  the  zone  sug- 
gested. In  the  east  end  of  the  zone,  the  houses  that 
were  badh"  damaged  southeast  of  the  \^eterans  Ad- 
ministration Hospital  were  of  two-story  design  (46). 
The  building  code  of  the  Cit&gt;-  of  Los  Angeles  does 
not  provide  for  differences  in  construction  between 
one-  and  two-story  houses.  Additional  bracing  could 
have  prevented  many  total  losses  of  these  houses  ac- 
cording to  Frazier  and  others  (1971,  p.  290). 

Many  of  these  badly  damaged  houses  were  built 
partially  or  wholly  on  artificial  fill.  The  relationship 
of  damage  to  house  design  and  building  site  was  not 


analyzed  for  this  report.  To  do  this,  the  sites  for  all 
houses  of  a  specific  design  in  a  tract  should  be  classi- 
fied as  bedrock,  \ounger  or  older  alluvium,  or  par- 
tiall\'  or  wholly  artificial  fill.  Other  factors  could  then 
be  related:  orientation  of  the  house  on  its  site  and 
its  orientation  relative  to  the  epicenter,  to  the  re- 
gional slope  angle,  and  to  the  estimated  attitude  of 
bedding  in  bedrock  at  surface  or  below  alluvium  or 
fill. 

Northwestern  Sylmar 

The  northwestern  side  of  the  Sylmar  inlier  of  the 
San  Fernando  Valley  constitutes  a  belt  of  serious  eco- 
nomic loss  from  damage  in  the  earthquake.  The  belt 
includes,  from  roughly  northeast  to  southwest,  damage 
to  the  Foothill  and  Golden  State  Freeways  and  their 
interchanges,  the  San  Fernando  Juvenile  Hall  of  the 
County  of  Los  Angeles,  the  Southern  Pacific  railroad 
bed  and  tracks,  the  Pacific  Intertie  Terminal  (includ- 
ing the  Sylmar  Converter  Station),  Upper  San  Fer- 
nando Dam  and  Van  Norman  Reservoir  of  the  Los 
Angeles  City  Department  of  Water  and  Power,  the 
Joseph  P.  Jensen  Filtration  Plant  of  the  iMetropolitan 
Water  District,  the  Van  Gogh  School  (Saul,  this  Bul- 
letin), residences,  and  other  buildings.  The  estimated 
cost  of  repair  and  replacement  of  damaged  structures 
and  apparatus  in  the  area  was  more  than  S50  million 
(Steinbrugge,  this  Bulletin). 

The  surface  effects  and  damage  within  this  belt 
lie  along  a  northeast-trending  alluvial  area  ^yhich  con- 
tains not  only  the  trace  of  the  concealed  Mission  Hills 
syncline  but  a  zone  of  probable  faulting,  most  of 
which  also  is  concealed.  Most  of  the  buildings  and 
other  structures  damaged  were  constructed  at  least 
partly  on  fill  over  younger  alluvium,  which  in  this 
area  ranges  from  silt  and  fine  sand  to  relatively  fine 
gravel.  At  the  south  edge  of  the  area.  Upper  San  Fer- 
nando Dam  is  abutted  in  north-dipping  beds  of  the 
Saugus  Formation.  A  facility  of  Bendix  Corporation 
constructed  on  Saugus  Formation  and  fill  slightly 
southeast  of  the  belt  of  damage  was  not  damaged 
severely. 

The  Mission  Hills  syncline  is  concealed  but  ex- 
tends into  the  area  from  the  southwest,  probably  to- 
wards the  Sombrero  Ranch  area  (plate  2).  Steeper 
dips,  generally  to  the  southeast,  suggest  that  the  axial 
plane  of  the  syncline  dips  southeast.  In  addition,  one 
or  more  faults  are  believed  to  extend  through  the  area: 
J.  C.  Hazzard,  for  Union  Oil  Company  (1953),  pro- 
jected a  branch  of  the  Santa  Susana  fault  northeast 
through  the  area  from  its  bedrock  exposures  to  the 
southwest;  Merifield's  work  (1958)  delineating  faults 
was  adapted  bv  Jahns  and  others  (1968)  and  further 
modified  after  the  earthquake  by  Proctor  and  others 
(1972). 

Surface  breaks  from  the  earthquake  m  this  area 
included  manv  ground  cracks,  sand  boils,  cracks  in 
concrete  and  asphalt,  and  shattered  earth  on  ridges  in 
low  foothills  to  the  northwest  underlain  by  the  Saugus 
Formation.  Ground  cracks  were  widespread  in  the 
area,  in  natural  ground  and  in  fill.  From  southwest  to 
northeast,  thev  occurred  locally  as  follows:  abundant 
pavement  cracks  in  the  Van  Gogh  School  area  and

ground  cracks  a  fourth  to  half  a  mile  north  of  the 
school  (\\);  cracks  in  the  fill  for  the  Joseph  P.  Jensen 
Filtration  Plant  (10);  bank  failures  and  sand  boils  in 
the  northern  part  of  \'an  Norman  Reservoir  (13); 
and  curvilinear  ground  cracks  which  extend  from 
northeast  of  San  Fernando  Juvenile  Hall  southwest 
into  the  Pacific  Intertic  Terminal  area  (14).  There 
were  other  ground  cracks  northeast  of  the  Juvenile 
Hall  in  the  area  of  Herrick  Avenue  and  Yarnell  Streets 
(26),  at  the  west  end  of  Norris  Street  (29),  and  scat- 
tered sparseK'  to  the  cast  of  tiic  Juvenile  Hall  toward 
Roxford  Street  (28). 

The  strong  curvilinear  cracks  to  the  northeast 
of  the  Juvenile  Hall  extended  southwest  at  least  900  m 
(nearly  3000  feet)  to  the  Pacific  Intcrtie  Terminal  in 
a  zone  as  wide  as  450  m  (nearly  1500  feet)  (photo  8). 


Photo  8.  View  northeast  from  front  parking  lot  of  San  Fernando 
Juvenile  Holl  shows  severe  damage  to  building.  It  also  shows  northwest 
margin  of  ground  cracking  caused  by  shoking  and  consequent  move- 
ment of  ground  in  right  port  of  photograph  to  southwest  toward  cam- 
era. Cracks  in  foreground  show  right-lateral  displacement;  those  on 
opposite  end  of  porking  lot  (off  the  right  side  of  photograph)  show 
left-lateral  displacement.  Photo  by  James  E.  Kohle. 

The  cracks  within  an  olive  grove  northeast  of  the  Hall 
clearly  showed  vertical  displacement  downward  on 
their  concave  sides  (27).  This  implies  that  the  ground 
inside  cither  settled  downward  during  shaking  or 
lurched  or  slid  southwcstward  at  an  angle  of  slightly 
less  than  1°,  even  though  maximum  slope  of  the 
ground  surface  in  the  area  more  toward  the  south  or 
south-southeast  is  at  an  angle  slighth-  greater  than  1°. 
Further  evidence  of  lurching  or  sliding  is  that  man- 
made  features  within  the  perimeter  of  cracking  are 
displaced  right  lateralK-  on  the  northwest  side  and  left 
laterally  on  the  southeast  side  (15).  .-Mso  within  the 
perimeter,  the  Southern  Pacific  railroad  tracks  \\ere 
bent  comprcssionally. 

Such  strong  features  of  ground  cracking  in  moist 
fine-grained  sandy  alluvium,  along  with  development 
of  sand  boils  at  the  surface,  impl\-  that  liquefaction  of 
sub-surface  strata  occurred  during  shaking,  causing 
gravitational  lurching  or  sliding.  Structures  built  on 
the  ground,  thus,  were  damaged  by  a  combination  of 
shakmg  and  ground  movement. 


Detailed  studies  of  the  relationship  of  the  geo- 
logic features  of  the  earthquake  to  damage  in  the 
Juvenile  Hall-Pacific  Intertie  area  have  been  made  by 
Youd  (1972,  p.  105-109)  and  by  Smith  and  Fallgre'n 
(this  Bulletin).  A  discussion  relating  damage  to  geol- 
ogy was  provided  by  Scott  (1971,  p.  299-331). 

The  ground  failure  of  the  Juvenile  Hall  and  Pa- 
cific Intcrtie  area  was  described  as  a  landslide  by  Youd 
(1971,  p.  105-109),  who  stated  that  the  ".  .  .  move- 
ments were  of  landslide  origin,  predominantly  by 
lateral  spreading  .  .  ."  He  also  stated  that  surveying 
data  along  San  Fernando  Road  would  allow  very  small 
left-lateral  tectonic  displacement  of  a  possible  north- 
east-trending fault  through  the  Juvenile  Hall  area, 
although  the  displacements  which  he  observed  in  the 
Juvenile  Hall  area  were  much  larger.  In  a  later  ab- 
stract, Youd  (1972)  stated  that  the  results  of  his  study 
"establish"  that  the  down  slope  movements,  as  large 
as  5.7  feet,  were  of  landslide  origin. 

Three  soil  t&gt;'pes  are  included  within  the  Juvenile 
Hall  area  of  ground  cracks  according  to  the  small- 
scale  map  of  soils  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley  pre- 
pared by  Holmes  and  others  (1917).  iMost  of  the  soil 
in  the  area  is  classified  as  Yolo  loam;  the  more  south- 
erly area  is  Yolo  sand\'  loam;  a  small  area  at  the  north- 
cast  is  Hanford  silt  loam;  and  the  area  of  cracks  is 
bordered  on  the  southeast  by  Dublin  clay  loam.  The 
Yolo  loam  is  said  by  Holmes  and  others  (1917)  to  be 
".  .  .  easily  penetrated  b\'  roots  and  water  and  re- 
tentive of  soil  moisture."  Thus,  the  Yolo  loam  would 
seem  to  be  ground  that  might  be  subject  to  liquefac- 
tion during  intense  earthquake  shaking. 

The  alluvium  slightly  south^\•est  of  the  Southern 
Pacific  railroad  tracks  is  known  to  be  at  least  41  m 
(135  feet)  deep,  as  a  California  Division  of  Highways 
drill  hole  to  that  depth  did  not  reach  bedrock.  The 
depth  to  the  ground  water  table  is  less  than  3  m  (10 
feet)  southwest  of  the  tracks  and  deepens  to  the 
northeast  (Brown,  this  Bulletin).  The  water  table 
deepens  to  7.5-9  m  (25-30  feet)  near  the  northeast 
edge  of  the  Juvenile  Hall  ground  cracks.  Trenches 
(T  9,  T  10,"  and  T  11)  dug  across  cracks  in  the 
Juvenile  Hall  area  were  examined  by  Allan  G.  Bar- 
rows and  James  E.  Kahle.  The  trenches  showed  cracks 
descending  to  moist  gravelly  layers  and  layers  of  moist 
siltv  sand  "from  depths  of  1.7  m  (5.5  feet)  to  at  least 
2.7  m  (9  feet),  the  greatest  depth  of  the  trenches 
(photos  9  and  10). 

Southwest  of  the  Juvenile  Hall  area,  the  cracks 
seem  to  diminish  in  strength  at  the  flood  control  chan- 
nel at  the  northeastern  edge  of  the  Pacific  Intertie 
Terminal  (15).  Southwest  of  the  channel,  the  strong- 
est effects  ma\'  lie  in  alluvium  beneath  fill,  which  here 
extends  to  \''an  Norman  Reservoir  and  around  its 
north  edge  (plate  2).  These  effects  may  extend  to 
the  surface  south  of  the  fill  as  numerous  sand  boils, 
which  were  noted  in  the  north  part  of  the  lake  bot- 
tom after  the  reservoir  was  partiall&gt;'  drained.  On  the 
other  hand,  these  sand  boils  may  have  been  caused  by 
subsurface  effects  unrelated  to  ground  cracks  to  the 
northeast,  or  they  may  have  been  caused  by  intense 
sliding  of  the  bank  around  the  north  edge  of  the 
reservoir  (photo  11).

Upper  San  Fernando  Dam  also  was  intensely- 
shaken  and  moved  horizontally  south  1.5  m  (5  feet) 
and  slumped  0.9  m  (3  feet)  as  reported  by  Duke 
(1971,  p.  228-229)  and  by  Scott  (1971,  p.  302-314). 
North-dipping,  reverse  faults  in  older  alluvium  and 
Saugus  Formation  just  southeast  of  the  dam  apparently 
were  not  active  during  the  earthquake  (plate  2).  Small 
landslides  did  occur  in  the  area,  however;  and  shat- 
tered earth  was  found  on  at  least  one  ridge  south  of 
the  dam  (plate  3). 

Farther  southwest,  strong  cracks  developed  in  the 
fill  for  the  Joseph  P.  Jensen  Filtration  Plant  (10). 
Damage  to  the  plant,  which  was  under  construction, 
was  attributed  by  Marachi  (1972)  to  "liquefaction  of 
a  layer  of  saturated  silt&gt;-  sand  alluvium  at  a  depth 
of  about  15  m  (50  feet)";  the  compacted  fill  also 
settled.  Acceleration  here  was  estimated  at  about  0.4  g

in  a  statement  by  H.  J.  Mills,  general  manager  of  the 
Metropolitan  Water  District,  reported  by  Duke  (1971, 
p.  226).  Strong  north-northcast-trending  cracks  also 
developed  west  of  the  fill  in  natural  ground  west  of 
Balboa  Boulevard  (11);  at  least  some  of  these  cracks 
were  down  on  the  east.  They  seemed  similar  to  the 
cracks  in  the  Juvenile  Hall  area,  except  that  they  were 
not  curvilinear. 

A  relationship  between  surface  breaks  in  the 
Juvenile  Hall- Van  Norman  Resers^oir  area  and  possi- 
ble faulting  cannot  be  discounted  entirely.  Faulting 
in  bedrock  in  the  area  may  have  extended  up  into  the 
alluvium  and  possibly  amplified  the  shaking,  or  some 
of  the  breaks  may  represent  the  surface  effects  of 
faulting. 

Evidence  for  prior  faulting  in  the  northwestern 
alluvial  area  of  the  Sylmar  inlier  is  based  partly  on 
projection  into  the  area  of  faulting  in  bedrock  to  the 
northeast  and  southwest  and  partly  on  gcomorphic 
evidence.  A  fault  was  mapped  in  the  Olive  View  Hos- 
pital area  and  named  the  Olive  \^iew  fault  by  Meri- 
ficld  (1958),  who  projected  it  southwest  just  north 
of  \^an  Norman  Reservoir. 

Merificld's  work  \\'as  modified  by  Jahns  and 
others  (1968),  who  delineated  a  North  Olive  View 
fault  as  well  as  the  Olive  View  fault  of  Merifield, 
both  projected  southwestward  from  bedrock  in  the 
northwestern  Olive  V^iew  area.  The  North  Olive  \''iew 
fault  was  projected  southwest  about  to  the  1399-foot 
elevation  benchmark  at  Foothill  Boulevard.  This  pro- 
jection was  made  on  the  basis  of  a  relatively  abrupt 
20-25  m  (70-80  foot)  change  upward  in  the  ground 
water  level  from  southeast  to  northwest  as  determined 
by  a  drilling  program  along  the  route  of  the  proposed 
San  Fernando  tunnel.  Tiiis  w  ork  was  further  modified 
bv  Proctor  and  others  (1972),  who  projected  the 
North  Olive  \'icw  fault  about  1  mile  farther  south- 
west and  modified  the  location  of  the  Olive  View 
fault  to  bring  the  two  faults  nearly  parallel  to  the 
strong  ground  cracks  northeast  of  the  Juvenile  Hall 
(plate  3).

In  earlier  work  of  Union  Oil  Company  (1953), 
j.  C.  Hazzard  extended  a  iirancli  of  the  Santa  Susana 
fault  into  this  area  from  the  southwest. 

Aerial  photographs  of  the  region  show  at  least 
two  apparent  fault  lines  trending  northeastward  in  the 
area  of  the  Juvenile  Hail.  Tiic  more  southeasterly  of 
these  lines  is  extended  on  plate  2  soutiiw  cstward  be- 
yond its  photographic  lineament  to  an  abrupt  bend  in 
tiic  Grapevine  Creek  drainage,  now  covered  by  fill 
for  the  Pacific  Intertic  Terminal  (plate  2).  Alost  of 
the  ground  cracks  which  developed  north-northeast 
or  northeast  of  San  Fernando  Juvenile  Hall  were  at 
least  slightl)'  curvilinear,  suggesting  that  they  were 
not  breaks  alone  faults;  but  rwo  2-story  houses  at  the 
west  end  of  Slorris  Street  were  severely  damaged 
where  ground  cracks  occurred,  implying  intense  shak- 
ing there  (29).  As  well,  the  photographic  lineaments 
do  not  seem  to  lie  exactly  along  the  trends  of  any  of 
these  cracks,  although  the  lineaments  are  not  precise 
linear  features  but  rather  zones  commonly  of  narrow 
but  indeterminate  width. 

Further  gcomorphic  evidence  of  possible  faulting 
and  relativcl\-  recent  Quatcrnar\'  uplift  of  hills  north 
of  the  alluvial  area  consists  of  abrupt  changes  in  stream 
gradients  at  the  mouths  of  Grapevine  and  other 
nearb\-  canyons,  with  resultant  fan  deposits. 

Surveying  data  in  a  report  by  the  Office  of  the 
Los  Angeles  County  Engineer,  Surveying  Division, 
(1972)  implies  that  horizontal  displacements  in  the 
western  Sylmar  area  during  the  earthquake  were  gen- 
erally to  the  south  and  southeast,  averaging  9-12  cm 
(0.3-0.4  feet)  in  the  San  Fernando  Pass  region.  Eleva- 
tion change  data  made  available  to  the  Division  by  the 
Los  Angeles  City  Surveyor  show  that  vertical  increases 
in  elevation  in  the  Sylmar  area  gradually  diminished 
to  the  west  from  a  maximum  of  2.47  m  (8.1  feet) 
near  Pacoima  Wash  channel  to  about  0.3  m  (0.9  feet) 
just  west  of  the  Juvenile  Hall  area.  This  change  im- 
plies that  the  general  intensity  of  tectonic  activit&gt;^ 
dies  out  to  the  west,  as  does  the  general  intensity'  of 
surface  effects  (figure  3). 

Ground  breaks  in  the  Saugus  Formation  just 
northwest  of  the  belt  of  damage  were  probably  fault 
lircaks  (16),  which  are  essentially  parallel  to  the  lower 
Santa  Susana  fault  to  the  northwest. 

It  is  also  possible  that  the  /Mission  Hills  syncline 
through  this  area  was  further  developed  during  the 
earthquake.  A  trend  of  decrease  in  vertical  elevation 
changes  lie?  along  the  southeast  edge  of  the  syncline 
(figure  2),  as  a  similar  effect  occurred  along  the  Mer- 
rick syncline  (Barrows,  this  Bulletin). 

San  Fernando  Fault  Zone 

The  San  Fernando  fault  zone  is  similar  to  other 
roughlx-  west  to  west-northwest  trending,  north-dip- 
ping reverse  fault  zones  of  the  Transverse  Ranges  of 
southern  California.  The  X'erdugo  fault  is  a  part  of 
this  SNStem  and  may  extend,  concealed  from  the  south- 
cast,  toward  the  San  Fernando  zone  near  Mission  Hills. 
The  Mission  Hills  fault,  concealed  just  south  of  Mis- 
sion Hills,  may  be  part  of  the  San  Fernando  zone  or 
the  V'erdugo  zone. 

The  principal  faults  of  the  San  Fernando  zone  dip 
north  irregularly  at  the  surface,  from  20°-2S°  N.  to 


vertical,  suggesting  that  the  fault  planes  may  be  rather 
sinuous.  Preliminar\-  interpretation  of  seismic  data  by 
Whitcomb  (1971,  p.  30-32)  suggests  that  the  principal 
fault  plane  affected  by  the  earthquake  dips  about  45°- 
50°  north  (also,  see  Bolt,  this  Bulletin).  Preliminary 
fault  plane  solutions  also  were  made  by  Dillinger  and 
Espinosa  (1971,  p.  142-149)  but  were  less  conclusive 
about  the  dip. 

In  the  Sylmar  area,  fault  traces  of  the  San  Fer- 
nando zone  generally  lie  along  the  contacts  bcr\\een 
tiie  Modclo  Formation  of  middle-late  Miocene  age  and 
the  Tow  sle\-  and  Pico  Formations  of  very  late  .Miocene 
to  middle  Pliocene  age  (plate  2).  These  rocks  are 
comnionl\-  folded  near  the  fault  zone  but  dip  moder- 
ateh"  north  over-all.  They  are  succeeded  generally 
north  of  the  zone  b\'  the  thick  nonmarinc  sequence  of 
the  Saugus  Formation,  including  its  Sunshine  Ranch 
Member  of  cstuarinc  origin.  The  Pacoima  Formation 
(Oakcshott,  1952)  overlies  the  Saugus  Formation  dis- 
conformably  in  the  foothills  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains, and  the  lithologic  constituents  reflect  a  change 
in  source  area  for  these  fluviatile  deposits  (Barrows, 
this  Bulletin).  The  r^vo  principal  folds  in  the  Sylmar 
area  arc  the  .Mission  Hills  anticline  in  the  Mission  Hills 
and  the  Mission  Hills  syncline  just  north  of  the  Mis- 
sion Hills. 

Reservoir  segment.  The  Reservoir  segment  is 
named  after  the  Reservoir  fault,  perhaps  the  most 
prominent  fault  to  have  been  delineated  in  the  south- 
ern Amission  Hills  before  the  earthquake  (Union  Oil 
Company,  1953).  The  segment  seems  to  comprise 
literally  a  tangle  of  faults  much  more  complex  than 
along  other  parts  of  the  zone  (plate  2),  but  this  un- 
usual complexity  is  probabl&gt;"  more  apparent  than  real 
because  the  rocks  in  the  southern  Alission  Hills  area, 
especially  on  the  east  side  of  former  Lower  Van 
Norman  Reservoir,  have  been  widely  exposed  in  cuts 
for  freeways  and  roads;  thus  a  complexity  of  faulting 
has  been  disclosed  A\hich  is  not  uncommon  in  such 
cuts  elsewhere  in  the  region.  In  addition,  trenches  and 
cuts  for  geologic  exploration  by  the  Los  Angeles 
Department  of  Water  and  Power  dug  along  the  edges 
of  the  former  reservoir  also  disclosed  many  pre-earth- 
quake  faults  (as  mapped  bv  Saul,  this  Bulletin,  plate  2). 

Pre-earthquake  faults  of  the  Reservoir  segment 
apparently  extend  concealed  northeast  into  the  .Mission 
Flills  through  the  area  of  the  site  of  Lower  San  Fer- 
nando Dam  and  toward  the  .Mission  Wells  segment. 
Faults  of  the  zone  were  mapped  in  the  area  by  Kew 
(1924)  but  not  extended  to  the  northeast;  they  were 
mapped  in  greater  detail,  especially  from  excellent 
exposures  along  cuts  for  old  Sepulveda  Boulevard  by 
Union  Oil  Company  (1953).  Part  of  the  zone  also 
was  mapped  by  Oakeshott  (1958).  Faults  of  the  zone 
dip  both  north  and  south,  and  dips  along  individual 
faults  var\-.  For  example,  the  dip  of  the  most  southerly 
fault  ranges  from  35°  south  to  nearly  vertical  just  from 
old  Sepulveda  Boulevard  (Blucher  .\venue)  75  m  (250 
feet)  eastward  to  the  west  side  of  the  San  Diego  Free- 
wa&gt;'. 

The  principal  tectonic  rupture  in  the  zone,  which 
is  the  strongest  and  best-documented  rupture  near 
Lower  San  Fernando  Dam,  lies  at  the  north  edge  of  the

Reservoir  segment,  where  it  occurred  \vliolI\'  in  man- 
made  cuts  (58).  This  east-trending,  north-dipping 
fault  displayed  both  reverse  and  left-lateral  sense  of 
movement  where  it  broke  the  Golden  State  Freeway. 
On  the  east  edge  of  the  San  Diego  Freeway,  successive 
concrete  drain  segments  for  a  distance  of  about  90  m 
(.^00  feet)  north  of  the  fault  were  overthrust  south  at 
the  seams  a  total  of  about  20  cm  (8  inches)  (photo 
12).

area  showed  that  seams  in  concrete  drain  along  east  side  of  freeway

tive southward  compression  of  approximately  8  inches  (20  cm).  Photo

Surface  effects  also  suggested  that  several  other 
faults  of  this  segment  were  active  during  the  earth- 
quake, if  only  l)ecausc  of  possible  intensified  shaking 
along  them;  such  shaking  may  have  caused  slight  dis- 
placement and  landsliding  in  artificial  cuts.  For  exam- 
ple, a  prominent  fault  that  strikes  northeast  and  dips 
north  was  displaced  slightly  upward  on  its  south  side 
in  the  west  cut  of  the  San  Diego  Frcewaw  Prominent 
cracks  along  this  fault  extended  northeast  away  from 
the  east  cut  of  the  freeway  for  about  30  m  (100  feet) 
across  a  flat,  artificiall\-  cut  surface  (57).  Additionally, 
a  minor  bedding-plane  fault  with  displacement  is  at 
the  north  end  of  the  west  cut.  A  crack  also  extended 
across  Rlucher  Avenue  (old  Sepulveda  Boulevard)  be- 
rv\cen  roadcut  exposures  of  a  fault,  and  repair  here 
of  a  pipeline  extending  along  the  avenue  suggested 
activitN-  along  the  fault  (55). 

There  ma\'  ha\c  been  displacement  along  a  south- 
east-dipping bedding  plane  fault  which  extends  south- 
\vcst  from  the  west  edge  of  Blucher  Avenue,  west  of 
the  Division  of  Highways  .station  (56).  Here,  the  con- 
tacts of  a  cla\ey  fine-grained  sandstone  or  siltstone 
layer  within  a  cf)ngl()mcrate  sequence  of  the  Sunshine 
Ranch  Member  of  the  Saugus  Formation  seem  to  have 
been  shaken  and  displaced.  The  rocks  abo\e  the  claye\- 
layer  appear  to  have  moved  slightly  upward  to  the 
north. 


To  the  east  of  this  break,  the  asphalt  cover  for  the 
fill  at  the  Division  of  Highwa\s  maintenance  station 
was  cracked;  a  landslide  de\eloped  in  the  west  part 
of  Blucher  .Avenue,  trending  toward  Lower  Van  Nor- 
man Reservoir.  Damage  in  this  small  area  was  minimal. 

Fault  breaks  along  the  trend  of  bedding  of  the 
Saugus  Formation  elsewhere  in  the  epicentral  area  may 
be  similar  secondary  effects  of  intensified  shaking  (see 
also  Saul  and  Barrows,  this  Bulletin). 

There  is  no  evidence  that  major  fault  rupture 
extended  to  the  Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  which 
partl\-  failed  by  sliding  northward  into  the  reservoir, 
though  prior  mapping  by  Kew  (1924)  shows  con- 
cealed faults  beneath  younger  alluvium  on  which  the 
h)-draulic  fill  for  the  dam  was  placed  (Cortright,  this 
Bulletin).  However,  a  small  break  relatively  close  to 
the  dam  was  mapped  by  Saul  (this  Bulletin)  (52). 
Cracks  without  displacement  developed  in  bedding  at 
the  top  of  the  ridge  245  m  (800  feet)  cast-northeast 
of  the  east  abutment  of  the  dam  (51).  Surficial  land- 
sliding  occurred  west  of  the  cracks  above  the  edge 
of  a  prominent  cut,  and  rocks  fell  off  the  cut  toward 
the  reservoir  during  the  earthquake.  Landsliding  also 
occurred  along  the  edges  of  a  ridge  directly  south  of 
the  east  abutment.  The  recorded  ground  acceleration 
nearest  to  the  dam  was  at  8244  Orion  Street,  about 
7  km  (4%  miles)  south;  maximum  vertical  accelera- 
tion there  was  .28  g  (Maley  and  Cloud,  1971,  p.  165; 
Cloud  and  Hudson,  this  Bulletin). 

Northwest  of  the  Reservoir  segment,  a  group  of 
surface  breaks  extended  northwestward  toward  Van 
Norman  Reservoir.  These  breaks  were  essentially  par- 
allel to  the  bedding  of  the  Saugus  Formation,  which 
underlies  much  of  the  area;  and  one  such  break  seemed 
to  be  essentially  along  the  northeast-dipping  contact 
between  the  upper  member  of  this  formation  and  the 
lower.  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  (plate  2)  (59).  Where 
it  crossed  part  of  the  concrete  surface  of  the  Golden 
State  Freeway  as  a  crack,  this  fault  break  showed 
small  reverse  and  left-lateral  displacement;  and  where 
it  extended  northwest  beyond  the  concrete  into  a  low 
cut,  it  became  a  mole  track. 

The  second  relatively  prominent  surface  break  cut 
a  ridge  capped  by  thin  older  alluvium  southwest  of 
the  Golden  State  Freeway  (61).  The  break  seemed 
similar  to  those  which  lay  5 'A  km  (3'/3  miles)  to  the 
east  in  the  Harding  School  area.  The  strike  of  the 
break  was  northwestward,  essentially  parallel  to  the 
underlying  Saugus  Formation.  It  was  about  135  m 
(about  450  feet)  long,  with  the  north  side  do-\\Ti  a 
maximum  of  about  15  cm  (6  inches).  Near  the  north- 
west end,  a  mole  track  la&gt;'  just  southwest  of  the  prin- 
cipal cracks.  There  were  many  additional  surface 
effects  of  the  earthquake  south  and  southeast  of  this 
break.  They  included  ground  cracks,  severe  cracking 
and  settling  of  the  fills  for  the  freeway,  and  crack- 
ing of  a  concrete  channel  west  of  the  freeway  (60) 
(photo  13). 

Northwest  of  these  breaks,  there  was  a  small 
break  in  the  Saugus  Formation  at  the  southeast  end 
of  a  debris  basin  (62).  AVest  of  this  locality,  at  least 
r\vo  pre-earthquake  faults  were  exposed  in  a  Los  An- 
geles Department  of  Water  and  Power  trench  which

onstrate 3  m  (10  feet)  or  more  of  reverse  offset  of 
the  contact  between  the  Saugus  Formation  and  older 
alluvium.  It  also  seemed  to  have  a  slight  south-facing, 
pre-earthquake  scarp  along  it  at  the  top  of  the  trench. 
The  more  northerly  fault  had  only  0.4  m  (1.3  feet) 
offset  in  a  prominent  sand  layer  in  the  older  alluvium; 
but,  at  the  top  of  the  trench,  a  wedge  of  soil  and  slope 
wash  that  extended  down  into  the  fault  suggested 
relatively  recent  pre-earthquake  activity. 

Mission  Hills  and  Verdiigo  faidts.  The  totally 
concealed  Mission  Hills  fault  was  mapped  by  Oake- 
shott  (1958)  at  least  partially  on  the  basis  of  evidence 
from  e.xploratory  oil-well  data.  Additional,  more  re- 
cent data  strongly  suggest  that  a  high-angle  reverse 
fault  extends  along  the  south  edge  of  the  Mission  Hills 
toward  the  possible  northeast  extension  of  the  Verdugo 
fault  (plates  2  and  5).  Alluvium  just  south  of  the 
Mission  Hills  thickens  abruptly  to  75  m  (250  feet) 
or  more  according  to  cross-section  E-E''of  plate  5B 
of  California  State  Water  Rights  Board  (1962),  prob- 
ably indicating  considerable  later  Quaternary  move- 
ment along  the  fault  which  caused  the  present 
Mission  Hills  to  form  north  of  it. 

Reverse  displacement  on  the  .Mission  Hills  fault 
just  east  of  the  Golden  State  Freeway  is  indicated  by  a 
cross  section  of  Union  Oil  Company  (1953).  This 
cross  section,  which  was  updated  recently  by  the 
company  to  account  for  the  latest  exploratory  well 
data,  shows  about  1200  m  (4000  feet)  of  reverse 
displacement  of  the  boundary  between  the  upper 
Mohnian  and  Delmontian  Stages  of  the  upper  Miocene. 

The  Verdugo  fault  may  extend  concealed  into  the 
area  from  the  southeast.  On  plate  2  of  this  Bulletin, 
the  fault  is  extended  along  a  ground  water  cascade 


plotted  by  the  California  State  Water  Rights  Board 
(1962,  plate  30  and  others).  Southeast  of  the  Alission 
Hills,  major  vertical  off.sct  along  the  Verdugo  fault 
and  perhaps  the  Northridge  Hills  fault  zone  has 
dropped  the  basement  rocks  in  the  San  Fernando  Val- 
lev  area  5500  m  (18,000  feet)  relative  to  the  basement 
rocks  in  the  highest  part  of  the  \'crdugo  Hills  to  the 
north  (interpreted  from  Corbato,  1963).  Offset  along 
these  and  related  faults  must  decrease  northwest  from 
the  \^erdugo  Hills  toward  the  Sylmar  area,  however, 
for  the  highest  elevation  of  the  basement  rocks  de- 
creases northwesr\\'ard  from  the  top  of  the  Verdugo 
Mountains  (3077  feet)  to  the  Pacoima  Hills  (1294 
feet)  and  to  the  .Mission  Hills.  Wells  drilled  to  about 
minus  9000  feet  in  elevation  in  the  Mission  Hills  area 
have  not  reached  basement. 

The  Verdugo  fault  also  is  considered  to  be  a  high- 
angle  reverse  fault  \\'hich  dips  nortii,  although  it  dips 
70°  south  where  the  California  State  Water  Rights 
Board  (1962,  p.  A-23)  observed  it  cutting  Quaternary 
older  alluvium  near  Burbank. 

Surface  breaks  apparently  did  not  occur  along  the 
Mission  Hills  and  \^erdugo  faults  during  the  earth- 
quake but  structures  approximately  along  the  trace  of 
the  concealed  Mission  Hills  fault  did  sustain  considera- 
ble damage.  Included  was  structural  damage  to  the 
modern  Holy  Cross  Hospital  (built  in  1950)  and  the 
nearly  new  Indian  Hills  Medical  Center,  both  multi- 
.storied  buildings  (54).  Aleman\-  High  School  and  the 
Rinaldi  Street  overpass  of  the  San  Diego  Freeway  also 
were  damaged.  Fills  for  the  freeway  spread  inward 
2-3  cm  (1+  inches)  toward  Rinaldi  Street  from  both 
the  north  and  south  directions  as  measured  from  offset 
sidewalks  (50).  The  cracks  in  the  sidewalks  on  Rinaldi 
Street  beneath  the  San  Diego  Freeway  were  repaired 
after  the  February  9  earthquake  but  reopened  slightly 
during  the  .March  31  aftershock,  when  Alemany  High 
School  was  damaged  again. 

No  permanent  ground  displacement  was  observed 
by  the  writer  in  this  area,  although  numerous  cracks 
in  asphalt  parking  lots  and  in  curbs  could  be  ob- 
served in  the  area  of  the  high  school  and  the  hospital 
and  at  the  Farmers  Insurance  Building,  about  a  block 
south  on  Sepulveda  Boulevard.  Ground  shaking  ap- 
pears to  have  been  relatively  strong  in  the  area,  judg- 
ing from  extensive  cracking  of  pavement  there.  With 
regard  to  damage,  Frazier  and  others  (1971,  p.  214) 
stated,  "The  Indian  Hills  Medical  Center  Building 
demonstrates  that  the  minimum  building  code  require- 
ments for  this  type  of  structure  lead  to  extensive  dam- 
age when  the  ground  motion  has  a  peak  acceleration 
in  the  range  of  30%  to  40%  g-" 

A  group  of  tensional  and  compressional  cracks 
formed  in  the  western  corner  of  the  city  of  San  Fer- 
nando (70).  Most  were  in  streets;  some  were  in  curbs 
and  sidewalks;  and  a  few  broke  the  ground  surface. 
These  cracks  may  be  related  to  possible  faults  in  bed- 
rock which  is  roughly  14-45  m  (50  to  150  feet) 
beneath  the  alluvium  here.  Strike  of  the  cracks  was 
northwest  to  east-northeast.  Possible  faults  along  these 
trends  are  indicated  on  plate  2  even  though  the  cracks 
do  not  seem  to  have  consistent  patterns  of  offset.  It 
is  also  possible  that  the  cracks  and  damage  were  related

to  shaking  of  wet  sand&gt;-  layers  of  alluvium,  but  this 
docs  not  seem  likely.  .\  shopping  center,  older  houses, 
schools,  and  churches  were  damaged.  The  cracks 
extended  toward  downtown  San  Fernando  where 
man\-  older  unrcinforccd  buildings  were  badly  dam- 
aged; but,  in  the  downtow  n  area,  nn!\-  minor  cracking 
in  pavements  could  lie  observed   (71). 

The  Pacoima  Hills  fault  (Oakeshott,  1958)  is  a 
north-dipping  fault  with  basement  complex  on  the 
south  and  Tertiary  sedimentary  and  volcanic  rocks 
in  the  Pacoima  Hills  north  of  the  fault.  It  was  exam- 
ined for  surface  expressions  of  activity-  during  the 
earth(]uakc,  but  none  was  found  (77).  Neither  were 
sucli  effects  found  along  the  projected  trace  of  the 
\'erdugo  fault  south  of  the  hills.  Preliminary  survey- 
ing data  compiled  by  the  Los  Angeles  Counr\-  Engi- 
neer, Survey  Division,  (in  press)  show  that  the  ground 
in  the  hills  at  trianguladon  station  "Pacoima  2"  appar- 
ently moved  relatively  south-southwest  0.78  m  (2.54 
feet)  during  the  event. 

Mission  Wells  scgiucjit.  The  Mission  Wells 
break  of  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone  seems  to  be  a 
southwest  extension  of  the  dramatic  ground  breaks  of 
the  S\lmar  segment  to  the  northeast  (plate  2).  Actu- 
ally, the  Mission  Wells  segment  may  be  a  more  south- 
crl&gt;"  fault  en  echelon  with  the  fault  breaks  of  the 
Syimar  segment.  The  Alission  Wells  break  demon- 
strated both  left-lateral  and  reverse  offset  along  nearly 
its  entire  length  from  Osceola  Street  northeastward 
to  the  Southern  Pacific  railroad  tracks. 

The  bedrock  geologic  relationships  of  the  Mission 
Wells  segment  arc  best  exposed  on  the  north  side  of 
Osceola  Street,  just  west  of  Rossiter  Avenue  (69). 
Here  the  fault  dips  about  60°  N.  and  places  north- 
dipping  Saugus  Formation  over  Modelo  Formation 
which  strikes  cast,  parallel  to  the  fault,  and  dips  south 
(plates  2  and  5).  South  facing  scarps  along  a  mole 
track  of  the  break  in  backyard  lawns  northwest  of 
Osceola  Street  were  as  high  as  12  cm  (5  inches).  At 
14901  Osceola  Street,  part  of  a  concrete  patio  was 
uplifted  on  the  north  about  15  cm  (6  inches)  and 
thrust  south  about  20  cm  (8  inches).  Left-lateral  off- 
set along  the  segment  was  probably  no  more  than 
2-3  cm  (about  1  inch)  and  showed  curbs  bowed  xtry 
slightly. 

There  was  damage  along  the  fault  to  houses,  a 
trailer  park,  Osceola  Street  School,  streets,  and  public 
utilities.  Two  houses  on  a  bedrock  cut  northwest  of 
Osceola  Street,  under  which  the  fault  broke,  were 
so  severely  damaged  that  they  required  demolition. 
In  contrast,  most  houses  on  older  alluvium  under 
which  the  .Mission  AVells  break  apparently  passed  have 
been  repaired. 

The  relationship  between  the  Mission  Wells  seg- 
ment and  faults  of  the  Reservoir  segment  is  not  ex- 
actly clear.  The  .Mission  Wells  fault  may  extend 
south-southeast  beyond  where  its  surface  break  dies 
out,  or  it  ma\'  extend  to  the  southwest  toward  the 
Reservoir  fault  segment. 

Between  the  .Mission  Wells  and  Syimar  segments, 
a  slight  pre-earthquake  rise  in  slope  can  be  observed, 
such  as  on  Ralston  .Avenue  across  a  field  northeast  of 
the  Southern  Pacific  railroad  tracks   (figure  4)    (68). 


The  area  north  of  the  interval  between  the  Mission 
\\'clls  and  S\lmar  segments  rose  at  least  slightly  in 
elevation  during  the  earthquake  according  to  survey- 
ing data  (figure  3;  Burford  and  others,  1971,  p.  81), 
even  though  there  apparcnth'  were  no  ground  breaks. 

The  .Mission  Wells  segment  died  out  at  the  rail- 
road tracks,  just  about  where  the  Syimar  notch 
(opening)  in  the  ground  water  impediment  described 
by  the  'California  State  \\'ater  Rights  Board  (1962) 
reaches  its  greatest  depth,  about  15  m  (50  feet).  It 
ma\-  be  coincident  that  a  fault  rupture  did  not  occur 
at  the  surface  between  the  .Mission  Wells  and  S\lmar 
segments;  but  more  reasonably,  probable  faulting  in 
the  bedrock  dissipated  into  the  thicker  alluvium  here 
before  reaching  the  surface.  The  Syimar  "notch"  ap- 
parcntl\-  extends  from  slightly  west  of  San  Fernando 
Road  to  about  Fourth  Street  just  southeast  of  Hubbard 
Street.  Within  75  m  (250  feet)  north  of  the  notch, 
bedrock  lies  5  m  (15  feet)  or  less  beneath  the  surface; 
whereas,  within  about  150  m  (500  feet)  south  of  the 
notch,  the  depth  to  bedrock  increases  to  20  m  (65 
feet)  or  more  as  interpreted  from  cross  sections  of  the 
California  State  Water  Rights  Board  (1962,  plate  5H). 
.•\  part  of  the  probable  buried  fault  scarp  east  of  the 
railroad  tracks  also  has  been  delineated  b\-  a  magnetic 
anomal\'  (Chapman  and  Chase,  this  Bulletin),  exactl\' 
along  the  projected  extension  of  the  fault  break 
mapped  to  the  west. 

The  .Mission  Wells  segment  may  extend  east  to 
Meyer  and  Lazard  Streets  in  San  Fernando,  where 
cracks  occurred  (76).  Thus  the  segment  may  extend 
concealed  eastward  toward  the  more  southerly  fault 
break  in  the  San  Fernando  Industrial  Park  (88),  rather 
than  northeast  toward  the  Syimar  segment. 

Even  though  the  exact  geologic  relationships  along 
the  .Mission  \A'ells  and  Syimar  segments  are  not  clear, 
a  strong  hypothetical  fault  trendinsi  north-northwest 
as  postulated  by  Merifield  (1958,  figure  5)  does  not 
seem  necessary  to  account  for  the  apparent  offset  in 
the  contact  between  the  Saugus  Formation  and  older 
rocks  as  projected  cast  from  the  .Mission  Hills  and 
west  from  the  Pacoima  A\'ash  area.  Hypothetical  con- 
cealed contacts  between  formations  shown  on  the 
accompanying  geologic  map  (plate  2)  suggest  a  rea- 
sonable stratigraphic  and  structural  match  of  the  rocks 
underlying  tlie  alluvium  between  the  Mission  Wells 
segment  and  the  San  Fernando  Industrial  Park  to  the 
east  without  such  a  cross  fault. 

Syhiiar  seppnent.  The  fault  breaks  which  make 
up  the  S\'lmar  segment  of  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone 
comprise  some  of  the  most  spectacular  effects  of  fault- 
ing in  the  earthquake  region.  These  breaks  extend 
east-northeast  from  near  Hubbard  Street  and  Glen- 
oaks  Boulevard  across  a  portion  of  the  most  heavily 
populated  part  of  Syimar  and  San  Fernando  to  just 
east  of  Pacoima  Wash  channel.  The  breaks  include  a 
swath  of  ground  cracks,  mole  tracks  and  cracked, 
broken,  and  compressed  pavement,  sidewalks  and 
curbs  as  much  as  275-360  m  (900  to  1200  feet)  wide, 
depending  on  the  limits  of  what  is  considered  faulting 
(photos  14,  15,  16,  and  17).

was  constructed  beneath  it;  severely  damaged  middle  house  was  un-

segment  extended  through  corner  of  building  in  far  carport  and  crossed

There  was  extensive  damage  along  the  Sylmar  seg- 
ment to  shopping  centers  and  other  businesses  at 
Glenoaks  Boulevard  and  Hubbard  Street,  to  many 
residential  houses,  to  a  modern  apartment  building,

damaged,  but  houses  on  north  (up-faulted)  side  were  generally  badly

replaced  an  older  one  (78).  At  one  site  where  a  fault 
break  cut  through  a  single-family  dwelling,  the  house 
had  been  razed  and  a  new  one  had  been  constructed 
partly  on  the  obvious  fault  scarp.  The  badly  damaged 
modern  apartment  building,  through  a  corner  of 
which  the  fault  passed,  had  been  razed;  and  the  re- 
sulting vacant  lot  had  no  apparent  trace  of  a  fault  in 
it  (sT).  Other  houses  had  been  removed.  The  Foothill 
Freeway,  with  a  spectacular  bend  added  to  it  during 
the  earthquake,  had  not  been  repaired  (8.^).  Between 
.Maclay  Avenue  and  Newton  Street,  every  house  had 
been  razed  along  the  path  of  the  main  break.  Sewer 
lines  and  streets  still  were  under  repair.  To  the  south-

cast,  most  of  the  badl\-  damaged  commercial  buildings 
of  the  San  Fernando  Industrial  Park  had  been  repaired 
and  were  being  used  again. 

The  most  \\esterl\-  breaks  of  the  fault  segment  were 
on  the  southwest  side  of  Hubbard  Street,  about  230  m 
(750  feet)  southwest  of  Cienoaks  Boulevard,  and  in 
front  of  The  Gables  (a  convalescent  liospital).  Diag- 
onally across  Hubbard  Street  to  the  southwest,  there 
were  compression  features  in  asphalt  curbing;  but  no 
trace  of  a  fault  break  was  apparent  (75).  To  the  cast- 
northeast  along  the  zone,  near  the  San  Fernando- 
S\'lmar  boundar\-,  the  segment  narrowed  and  bent 
slightly  to  trend  almost  due  east.  Just  cast  of  Pacoima 
Wnsh  channel,  a  single  break  bent  southeast  along  the 
base  of  the  curve  in  the  hills  and  apparently  died  out 
althougli  a  break  along  rlic  same  trend  to  the  south 
in  the  San  Fernando  Industrial  Park  was  probably 
along  the  same  fault  (plate  2).  Southeast  and  cast  from 
the  mdustrial  park,  the  fault  breaks  are  part  of  the 
Tujunga  segment  (Barrows,  tliis  Bulletin). 

The  details  of  faulting  along  the  Sylmar  segment 
during  the  earthquake  have  been  reported  cspeciall&gt;' 
bv  geologists  of  the  California  Institute  of  Technolog\' 
(kamb  and  others,  1971,  p.  41-54)  and  the  U.  S.  Geo- 
logical Survey  (1971,  p.  55-76;  Sharp,  this  Bulletin; 
and  Bonilla,  1972  and  in  press). 

Fault  breaks  of  the  segment  demonstrated  left- 
lateral,  normal  (vertical)  and  shortening  (thrust)  com- 
ponents of  faulting.  For  example,  on  the  principal 
break  in  younger  alluvium  just  cast  of  Newton 
Street,  a  fence  was  offset  left  laterally  30  cm  (12 
inches);  vertical  offset  (down  on  the  south)  was  also 
30  cm  (12  inches)  (T5).  On  Comcta  Avenue  in  San 
Fernando,  the  major  southerly  break  showed  curbs 
offset  left  laterally  1.15  m  (3.7  feet)  and  the  ground 
surface  down  vertically  on  the  south  side  23  cm  (9 
inches).  Shortening  to  the  south  of  the  southwest 
sidewalk  along  Glenoaks  Boulevard  at  the  southern 
periphery  of  the  fault  segment  was  about  50  cm  (1.6 
feet).  In  addition  to  damage,  these  displacements  have 
created  surveying  and  legal  problems  for  re-establish- 
ment of  property  lines  (F,lling\\ood  and  Williamson, 
1971;  Mitchell,  1971).  Horizontal  displacements  along 
the  Sylmar  segment,  as  measured  by  geodetic  survey- 
ing methods,  reached  at  least  1  m  (3.18  feet)  (Los  An- 
geles County  Engineer,  Survey  Division,  1972,  fig- 
ure 10). 

The  fault  breaks  of  the  segment  lie  along  the 
front  of  a  group  of  relatively  young,  low  hills  which 
consist  of  older  alluvium  overlying  north-dipping  beds 
of  the  Towslcy/Pico  Formations  and  the  Saugus  For- 
mation. This  older  alluvium  is  bouldery  and  relatively 
coarse  grained;  it  is  derived  from  the  gneiss  and  other 
igncous-metamorphic  rocks  present  in  the  San  Ga- 
briel Mountains  to  the  north.  It  lies  as  a  veneer  of  per- 
haps 3  to  10  m  (10  to  35  feet)  in  average  thickness 
and  is  similar  to  the  older  alluvium  which  lies  par- 
tialh'  draped  over  the  Mission  Hills  to  the  south\vcst. 
It  is  probabl\"  similar  to  much  of  the  older  alluvium 
above  the  bedrock  surface  of  the  entire  Sylmar  inlier 
of  the  San  Fernando  Valley.  A  southeasterly  trending 
magnetometer  traverse  across  Hubbard  Street  just 
southwest  of  Glenoaks  Boulevard  delineated  a  strong 


anomaly  across  the  fault  zone  probably  caused  by  a 
change  in  the  character  or  thickness  of  the  magnetite- 
bearing  alluvium  (Chapman  and  Chase,  this  Bulletin). 
Subsurface  expression  of  the  fault  segment  was 
relatively  obscure  \\here  alluvial  materials  underlie 
ground  breaks:  especiall)'  &gt;'oung,  unconsolidated  sand 
and  gravel,  such  as  on  the  east  side  of  Newton  Street. 
Hardly  a  trace  of  the  fault  could  be  observed  here  in 
the  walls  of  a  trench  dug  by  the  Division  of  Mines 
and  Geology  across  a  prominent  scarp  (T5,  plate  3). 
In  a  trench  (Tl3,  plate  3)  examined  1)\'  James  E. 
Kahic,  \\  hich  was  dug  by  the  Division  into  more  con- 
solidated older  alluvium  just  northeast  of  the  Foothill 
Freeway,  a  primary  fault  break  dips  50°-55°  N.  Bed- 
ding of  the  Towslcy/Pico  Formations  to  the  west  on 
Gladstone  Avenue  and  slightly  north  of  the  fault 
break  strike  parallel  to  the  fault  and  dip  55°-60°  N. 
(figure  2,  plate  2).  Older,  moderately  consolidated 
alluvium  in  the  sides  of  a  large  trench  dug  to  repair 
the  badl\'  broken,  buried  flood  control  channel  on 
Eighth  Street,  between  Gridlc\'  and  Fcrnmont  Streets, 
seemed  to  shou^  little  or  no  evidence  of  faulting  below 
mole  tracks  of  the  fault  segment  \\hich  extended  to 
the  edge  of  the  trench  (80).  Nearby,  a  narrow,  more 
accessible  trench  to  replace  utilit\'  lines  along  Knox 
Street,  just  southeast  of  Orange  Grove  Avenue, 
showed  a  similar  lack  of  geologic  expression  where  a 
mole  track  was  exposed  in  lawns  on  both  sides  of  the 
street. 

The  principal  trend  of  maximum  elevation  in- 
crease in  the  Sylmar  area  during  the  earthquake  ex- 
tends cast  from  the  intersection  of  Glenoaks  Boule- 
vard and  Hubbard  Street  to  a  point  just  south  of  Lopez 
Dam  in  Pacoima  Wash  (figure  3).  The  trend  lies  es- 
sentially along  the  north  edge  of  the  Sylmar  segment. 
The  point  surveyed  by  the  Cit_\-  of  Los  Angeles  which 
had  the  greatest  rise  in  elevation  is  about  180  m  (600 
feet)  north  of  where  the  principal  fault  of  the  segment 
crossed  Newton  Street  (84).  This  rise  was  2.47  m 
(8.1  feet).  On  the  east  end  of  the  trend,  the  inter- 
section of  Glenoaks  Boulevard  and  Hubbard  Street 
rose  nearl\'  1.5  m  (5  feet),  from  an  elevation  of  about 
1179  feet  to  about  1184  feet;  whereas  to  the  south- 
west about  410  m  (1350  feet),  the  intersection  of 
Hubbard  Street  and  Herrick  .Avenue  rose  only  0.12  m 
(0.4  feet)  from  its  previous  ele\ation  of  1149  feet. 
This  rise  in  elevation  (up-dip  to  the  north)  of  the 
principal  reverse  faults  of  the  Sylmar  segment  sug- 
gests that  the  ground  surface  here  bowed  upward 
slightly  during  the  earthquake  (figure  2).  Thus  a 
sense  can  be  gained  of  how  the  area  of  older  alluvium 
north  of  the  principal  faults  has  begun  to  "grow"  into 
hills  during  faulting  during  earthquakes. 

The  Tujunga  segment  extends  west  into  the  San 
Fernando  Industrial  Park  area  and  seems  to  split,  with 
one  branch  extending  north  toward  the  Sylmar  seg- 
ment and  another  branch  extending  slightly  north  of 
west.  The  \\'est-trending  branch  demonstrated  left- 
lateral  reverse  displacement;  and,  judging  by  a  south- 
sweeping  bend  up  onto  a  small  rise  where  the  grade 
for  the  uncompleted  Foothill  Freeway  had  been  pre- 
pared, the  fault  may  dip  very  gently  north  there  (88). 
This  branch  extended  west-northwest  as  a  mole  track

with  parallel  tension  cracks  north  of  it  through  a  field 
which  once  was  part  of  Pacoima  Wash  before  a  chan- 
nel was  built  for  it.  The  fault  break  could  not  be 
traced  west  of  the  channel;  but,  if  the  fault  does  ex- 
tend concealed  to  the  west,  it  ma&gt;'  trend  toward  the 
east  end  of  the  Alission  Wells  segment,  perhaps  gen- 
erally along  the  concealed  contact  between  the  Alodelo 
and  Towsley  Formations  (plate  2). 

Considerable  damage  occurred  in  the  San  Fer- 
nando Industrial  Park,  where  many  of  the  light  in- 
dustrial buildings  Mere  constructed  of  concrete  tilt-up 
walls  and  panelized  ph^vood  roofs.  In  the  eastern  part 
of  the  Park,  a  fault  break  seems  to  have  extended 
through  the  California  National  Guard  building,  which 
sustained  very  little  damage;  this  building  is  reported 
to  have  been  built  according  to  Field  Act  standards. 
The  degree  of  shaking  in  the  area  was  suggested  by  a 
resident  directly  across  Foothill  Boulevard  from  the 
large  scarp  west  of  the  site  for  the  former  Foothill 
Nursing  Home  (90);  he  stated  early  the  morning  of 
the  earthquake  that,  when  he  came  out  of  his  house  on 
the  south  side  of  the  boulevard,  people  in  cars  who 
stopped  there  after  the  shaking  had  blood  on  their 
faces,  suggesting  the  degree  to  which  they,  and  possi- 
bly their  automobiles,  had  been  tossed  around. 

North  of  the  Sybnar  segment.  There  wzs  a  prom- 
inent group  of  fault  breaks,  street  cracks,  and  broken 


curbs  300  to  600  m  (1000  to  2000  feet)  north  of  the 
eastern  part  of  the  Sylmar  segment,  in  the  Harding 
School  area  and  vicinity.  The  fault  breaks  strike  slightly 
north  of  east  and  seemed  to  fan  out  slightly  to  the 
west,  a\\ay  from  the  trend  of  the  Sylmar  segment. 
Though  the  breaks  occurred  in  relatively  thin  older 
alluvium,  they  probably  strike  parallel  to  bedding  of 
the  underlying  Saugus  Formation,  similar  to  a  break 
to  the  west  at  locality  61  near  the  site  of  former 
Lower  Van  Norman  Reservoir. 

The  most  southerly  of  these  breaks  was  exposed 
in  the  Foothill  Freeway  (82)  (photo  18);  this  fault 
broke  very  slightly  left  laterally  and  down  slightly 
to  the  south  at  the  northeast  edge  of  the  freeway.  In 
the  northeast  freeway  cut,  the  fault  seemed  to  dip 
steeply  north  with  total  pre-earthquake  reverse  dis- 
placement of  perhaps  30  m  (100  feet)  or  more  of  the 
very  gently  north-dipping  angular  unconformity  be- 
tween the  Towsley /Pico/Saugus  sequence  (Plio-Pleis- 
tocene)  and  the  overlying  older  alluvium  (Pleis- 
tocene). 

The  faults  north  of  the  one  exposed  in  the  free- 
way are  on  the  north  side  of  the  trend  of  maximum 
elevation  change  (85).  These  breaks  were  offset  ver- 
tically and  downward  to  the  north,  commonly  ac- 
companied    by     small     right-lateral     displacements.

Houses,  Aka  .Mesa  Convalescent  Hospital  (formerly 
Higliland  Sanitarium),  and  Harding  School  were  dam- 
aged. At  least  one  of  the  faults  extended  east  into  the 
base  of  Lopez  Dam,  which  was  damaged.  Where  the 
trace  of  one  of  these  breaks  was  observed  in  a  small 
cliff  just  west  of  Lopez  Dam,  the  ground  .seemed  to 
contain  an  abundant  growth  of  pre-earthquake  vegeta- 
tion, but  a  nearly  horizontal  unconformit\'  exposed 
there  of  Saugus  Formation  overlain  by  older  alluvium 
has  essentialK'  no  appreciable  pre-earthquake  offset. 
These  breaks  may  reflect  tension  release  within  bed- 
ding planes  of  the  Saugus  Formation.  Rocks  to  the 
north  of  the  west  trend  of  maximum  elevation  rise 
arc  step-faulted  down  to  the  north  to  reflect  decreasing 
change  in  elevation  in  that  direction  (figures  2  and  4). 

A  lesser  trend  or  "nose"  of  elevation  increase 
s\\  ings  northwest  from  near  Hubbard  Street  and  Fen- 
ton  Avenue  and  extends  toward  the  Olive  View  Hos- 
pital area  according  to  data  of  the  Los  Angeles  City 
Surveyor  (figure  2).  A  third  trend  extends  west  from 
near  tiie  intersection  of  Hubbard  Street  and  Foothill 
Boulevard  to  near  the  intersection  of  Tyler  Avenue 
and  Borden  Street,  then  southeast  to  San  Fernando 
Road  between  Roxford  and  Bledsoe  Streets,  follo\\'ing 
a  0.6  m  (2  foot)  maximum  contour. 

The  detailed  topography-  of  the  1953  U.  S.  Geo- 
logical Survey  map  of  the  San  Fernando  quadrangle 
shows  several  fault  scarps  in  the  Svlmar  area  (figure  4). 
The  topography  clearly  shows  the  scarp  of  the  main 
Sylmar  segment  from  the  Pacoima  Wash  area  at  least 
as  far  west  as  Orange  Grove  Avenue  and  suggests  that 
the  scarp  has  a  maximum  height  of  at  least  7.5  m  (25 
feet).  It  also  seems  to  express  the  scarp  of  the  fault 
exposed  in  the  Foothill  Freewa\'  for  a  distance  of  at 
least  1200  m  (4000  feet)  and  perhaps  1800  m  (6000 
feet).  The  map  also  shows  the  trace  of  a  possible  third 
fault  to  the  north,  which  would  also  have  a  south- 
facing  scarp  (plate  2).  Surface  cracks  along  this  third 
apparent  fault  trace  do  not  seem  to  indicate  faulting, 
however  (86).  The  map  also  was  useful  in  differen- 
tiating the  uplifted  and  dissected  older  alluvium  from 
the  younger  alluvium  in  this  area,  as  shown  on  plate  2. 

Central  Part  of  the  Sylmar  Inlier 

The  area  in  the  central  part  of  the  Sylmar  inlier 
was  considerably  damaged,  but  the  damage  was  not 
easily  related  to  the  tectonic  features  of  the  earth- 
quake. For  example,  in  the  area  immcdiateK'  west  of 
the  intersection  of  Hubbard  Street  and  Foothill  Bou- 
levard, shopping  centers,  S\lmar  High  School,  a  large 
apartment  building  (Frida\-  USA)  at  12960  Dronfield 
Avenue  (79),  and  an  enclosed  reservoir  at  Hubbard 
Street  and  Dronfield  .\ venue  were  damaged.  Tiic  area 
lies  along  a  trend  of  elevation  increase  (figure  3),  but 
faults  that  lie  to  the  cast  did  not  break  this  far  west. 
Xo  permanent  ground  cracks  were  seen  although 
street  cracks  through  this  area  commonly  trend  west. 
Some  of  them  were  comprcssional  and  accompanied 
broken  curbs  and  sidewalks. 

Two  strong  comprcssional  breaks  in  the  Foothill 
Freeway  at  .Astoria  Street  and  comprcssional  effects  to 
the  southeast  along  Foothill  Boulevard  in  this  area 
could  not  be  linked  directly  to  faulting. 


The  geology  of  the  nearly  flat  surface  of  the  Syl- 
mar inlier  of  the  San  Fernando  \'alley  is  of  interest  be- 
cause much  damage  from  the  earthquake  occurred  on 
it;  _\'et,  most  of  it  was  not  faulted,  although  bedrock 
beneath  alluvium  may  have  been  faulted.  The  bed- 
rock surface  of  the  inlier  was  formed  by  erosion  be- 
fore it  was  covered  by  boulder\-  late(r)  Pleistocene 
and  Holocene  alluvium.  The  surface  north  of  the  fault 
zone  is  in  the  initial  stages  of  uplift  and  erosion,  as 
the  area  east  of  Pacoima  Wash  is  in  a  similar  but  more 
advanced  stage. 

The  gently  south-dipping,  nearly  flat  surface  of 
the  Sylmar  inlier  is  within  the  same  general  (275  to  425 
m,  900  to  1400  feet)  elevation  range  as  similar  moun- 
tain and  hill  front  surfaces  elsewhere  in  this  region 
that  are  covered  by  veneers  of  alluvium  or  colluvium. 
Fxamplcs  of  such  surfaces  include  the  eastern  Simi 
Valle\'  area  and  parts  of  the  Thousand  Oaks  area. 
These  surfaces  seem  beveled  and  uplifted  similar  to 
known  400,000-\car-old  marine  terraces  as  high  as 
400-425  m  (1300  to  1400  feet)  in  the  coastal'Palos 
\'erdes  Hills  and  \^entura  areas.  No  marine  deposits 
have  been  found  on  the  interior  surfaces,  but  perhaps 
csruarine  deposits  have  been  overlooked.  The  very 
northern  edge  of  the  Sylmar  surface  is  about  490  m 
(1600  feet)  in  elevation,  about  the  same  as  that  of 
Horse  Flats  and  other  uplifted  areas  to  the  west. 

The  intensity  of  surface  effects  in  the  central  part 
of  the  Sylmar  area  may  be  related  at  least  partly  to  the 
thickness  of  the  alluvial  cover  above  the  Saugus  For- 
mation which  is  presumed  to  be  present  at  depth 
here.  Younger  and  older  alluvium  probabl&gt;'  thicken 
generalh'  from  east  to  west,  averaging  7.5  to  15  m 
(20  to  50  feet)  thick  according  to  cross  sections  of  the 
California  State  Water  Rights  Board  (1962,  plate  5B). 
In  the  north  part  of  the  Sylmar  area,  the  alluvium 
reaches  depths  of  60  m  (200  feet)  according  to  cross 
sections  of  a  report  by  Jahns  and  others  (1968). 
Where  possible  fault  activity  in  bedrock  extends  up- 
ward to  the  surface  in  alluvium,  surface  cracks  and 
damage  may  reflect  trends  of  faulting  below  as  in  the 
vicinitN'  of  F.ldridge  Avenue  and  Sayre  Street  (87). 
.Many  street  cracks  in  the  flat  part  of  S&gt;-lmar  seem  to 
trend  parallel  to  the  general  strike  of  the  Saugus  For- 
mation below  the  alluvium,  but  this  could  not  be 
proven.  Generally,  the  local  abundance  and  intensity 
of  street  cracks  and  broken  curbs  reflect  the  intensity 
of  local  damage,  but  no  exact  relationship  to  this  pat- 
tern could  be  established. 

A  possible  fault  break  comprises  a  zone  of  street 
cracks  west  of  Sylmar  High  School,  northeast  of  Her- 
rick  Avenue  (74).  .At  14733  Lakeside  Street,  a  ground 
depression  extended  across  the  front  yard  and  into  the 
house,  where  there  was  a  crack  in  the  concrete  porch 
base.  This  zone  was  mapped  tentatively  as  a  fault 
break  (plates  2  and  3). 

Southw  est  of  this  feature  lies  the  Sylmar  Industrial 
Park  in  the  vicinit&gt;'  of  Bledsoe  Street  and  Bradley 
.Avenue,  where  several  buildings  were  structurally 
damaged  during  the  earthquake  (65).  Abundant  cracks 
in  asphalt  streets  and  parking  lots,  broken  curbs,  and 
severe  cracks  in  buildings  were  seen  here.  A  few  of 
the  cracks  could  be  traced  into  the  ground,  especially

those  alontr  S:iii  Fcrnnncio  Rond  northeast  of  the  rail- 
roail  tracks  near  T&gt;Icr  Street.  One  remote  but  perhaps 
related  ground  crack  trending  northwest  was  observed 
in  a  wasli  between  San  Fernando  Boulevard  and  Co- 
balt Street  (63).  The  dominant  trend  of  the  street 
cracks  of  the  Svlmar  Industrial  Park  is  southwestward 
into  the  F.l  Dorado  School  area  (66).  The  cracks  in 
the  Industrial  Park  and  School  areas  generally  showed 
no  vertical  offset,  but  some  did  show  left-lateral  dis- 
placement. The  reason  for  tiie  cracks  in  the  area  is 
not  known;  perhaps  the\-  arc  related  to  liquefaction  of 
soils  during  shaking  and  involving  concealed  fault  ac- 
tivity. 

There  were  relativeh-  strong  street  cracks  and 
damaged  houses  in  the  vicinity  of  Cobalt  Street  and 
Dronfield  Avenue  in  the  \ounger  alluvium,  but  they 
could  not  be  related  to  faulting  (72);  similar  street 
cracks  and  damage  in  the  vicinity  of  Sayrc  Street  and 
Eldridge  Avenue  may  be  related  to  possible  fault  ac- 
tivity at  depth  (87).  A  strong  break  across  Astoria 
Street  just  northeast  of  Garrick  Avenue  was  probably 
formed  by  the  effects  of  compaction  or  compression 
during  shaking  in  a  small  fill  for  part  of  the  street 
there  (44)  (photo  19). 


Photo  19.  Comprcssionol  break  in  sidewalk,  parking,  and  curb  of 
Astoria  Street  about  30  m  (100  feet)  northeast  of  Garrick  Avenue  (lo- 
colity  44).  View  is  northwest,  neorly  half  a  mile  southwest  of  Veterans 
Administrotion  Hospital.  Feature  does  not  extend  beyond  street  area 
and  therefore  probably  connot  be  ottributed  to  faulting;  more  likely  it 
wos  caused  by  the  shaking  of  the  eorthquoke,  perhaps  acting  on  a 
relatively  weak  fill  in  this  portion  of  the  street.  House  wos  not  badly 
domoged. 

At  two  localities,  older,  pre-carthquake  street 
cracks  seem  to  have  been  reactivated  during  the  earth- 
quake: RIedsoe  Street,  just  north  of  Glenoaks  Boule- 
vard (73)  and  Roxford  Street,  north  of  Bradley  Ave- 
nue (64).  Perhaps  these  cracks  were  caused  originally 
by  settling  of  the  ground  surface  caused  by  compac- 
tion of  the  alluvium. 

Street  cracks  do  not  seem  to  be  related  generally 
to  soil  types  in  the  alluvium.  In  the  area  called  "San 
Fernando  La  Cienega"  by  the  California  State  Water 
Rights  Board  (1962),  there  was  rclati\el\'  little  damage 
ami  little  street  cracking.  This  area  lies  along  San  Fer- 
nando Road  from  just  west  of  Oro  Grande  Street,  cast 
to  about  the  intersection  of  Hcrrick  Avenue  and  Hub- 


bard Street  (67).  The  area  was  judged  by  the  Califor- 
nia State  Water  Rights  Board  (1962),  on  the  basis  of 
the  calcium  carbonate  content  of  its  soil,  to  have  had 
a  very  high  water  table  (1.2  m  (4  feet)  below  the 
surface)  before  water  was  first  removed  intensively 
for  agriculture  nian\"  years  ago.  If  the  water  table  had 
been  close  to  the  surface  during  the  earthquake,  dam- 
age probably  would  have  been  much  greater. 

CONCLUSIONS 
The  San  Fernando  earthquake  affected  the  very 
northern  edge  of  the  hea\ily  populated  portion  of  the 
Los  Angeles  region.  .Although  the  earthquake  resulted 
in  death  and  injury  to  people  and  more  than  S500  mil- 
lion in  damage,  the  results  of  a  similar  6.4  magnitude 
event  in  a  slightly  more  densely  populated  portion  of 
the  region  could  have  been  far  more  devastating.  As  a 
lesson  from  only  partial  disaster,  the  earthquake  has 
offered  a  unique  opportunit\-  to  stud\'  its  geologic  ef- 
fects relative  to  the  damage  in  the  Svlmar  area. 

To  go  along  with  the  good  luck  of  having  the 
earthquake  occur  at  6:00  a.m.,  it  was  also  good  luck 
that  none  of  the  severcl\"  damaged  hospitals  lay  di- 
rcctl\-  over  a  fault  that  ruptured  during  the  earth- 
quake. Generall)-,  w  here  single-story  houses  and  small 
commercial  buildings  stood  along  faults  that  ruptured, 
they  were  severely  damaged;  where  similar  buildings 
stood  near  the  severely-  damaged  hospitals,  they  were 
not  severely  damaged. 

To  study  the  spectacular  geologic  effects  along  the 
principal  earthquake  faults  is  scicntificall\-  important, 
but  serious  damage  in  this  earthquake  occurred  in 
man\'  areas  apparenth-  with  little  relationship  to  fault- 
ing. A  pragmatic  field  method  for  better  relating  the 
cause  of  widespread  damage  to  the  geologic  and  seis- 
mic effects  is  needed;  such  a  method  could  result  in 
a  .Mcrcalli-t\pc  map  prepared  A\ithout  interpreting 
nongeologic  effects.  The  map  would  tie  the  effects  of 
faulting  and  ground  shaking  to  the  areal  geology  and 
thus  create  a  better  guide  for  planning  in  an  area  af- 
fected b\'  an  earthquake,  as  well  as  in  other  areas. 
The  features  utilized  in  making  such  a  map  would 
range  from  mundane  street  cracks  to  spectacular  fault 
breaks  and  would  include  such  shaking  effects  as  shat- 
tered soil,  landslides,  and  even  the  effects  on  certain 
plants  (like  prickly  pear  cactus,  the  leaves  of  which 
tend  to  break  off). 

In  addition,  accelerographs  should  be  placed  on  a 
wide  variet\-  of  rock  types  and  geologic  environments 
just  after  a  main  earthquake.  Thus,  data  on  shaking 
during  aftershocks  could  be  analyzed  and  related  to 
the  over-all  geologic  environment  and  the  pattern  of 
damage. 

Earthquake  EfFecfs  on  Rock  Types 

No  analysis  was  made  in  the  Sylmar  area  to  relate 
.surface  features  to  individual  geologic  units.  The  rela- 
tionship of  landsliding  and  other  surface  features  to 
formations  cast  of  the  S\lmar  area  has  been  discussed 
by  .Morton  and  by  Barrows  (this  Bulletin). 

The  Saugus  Formation  seems  to  be  prone  to  minor 
faulting  along  certain  clay-bearing  layers,  and  the 
faults  of  the  San  Fernando  zone  are  essentially  along 
bedding  planes  and  formational  contacts  of  the  upper

Artificial  fills  commonly  failed  by  seismic  com- 
paction and  lateral  spreading.  Cracks  developed  in 
artificial  fills  at  many  localities  ranging  from  large  fills 
for  freewa\'s  to  small  house  pads. 

Need  for  Geologic  Mapping 

The  geologic  mapping  that  was  a  part  of  this 
study  resulted  in  a  partially  successful  attempt  to  dif- 
ferentiate varieties  of  older  and  younger  alluvium. 
Differentiation  of  these  units  is  necessary  if  the  Qua- 
ternary geologic  and  seismic  histor\'  of  southern  Cali- 
fornia is  to  be  fully  understood.  The  ^\•ork  also  has 
illustrated  that  all  vintages  of  aerial  photographs  and 
topographic  maps  are  useful  in  relativeh'  large-scale 
mapping.  Use  of  geophysical  methods,  ground  water 
knowledge,  trenches,  and  water  and  explorator\'  oil 
well  data  are  also  necessary  to  study  faulting  properly. 
The  post-earthquake  mapping  showed  that,  in  an 
area  populated  b)-  more  than  50,000  people,  with  a 
very    large    capital    investment    and    relativeh^    well- 


studied  geology,  a  great  deal  was  not  known.  This  is 
partly  because  of  the  complexit\-  of  the  geology  and 
the  need  for  larger-scale  study,  partly  because  some 
of  the  work  was  done  before  artificial  cuts  yielding 
exposure  of  critical  geologic  features  were  made  avail- 
able and  because  not  all  of  tiic  knowledge  had  been 
collated  into  a  single  basic  map  or  group  of  maps. 

Faulting 

Age.  Slightly  west  of  upper  Sombrero  Canyon, 
the  surface  on  which  the  lower  beds  of  the  Towsley 
Formation  (late  Miocene  or  earl\-  Pliocene)  lie  un- 
conformably  on  crystalline  rocks  ma\-  be  thrust  more 
than  3.5  km  (more  than  2  miles)  south  on  the  north- 
dipping  eastern  end  of  the  Santa  Susana  fault.  The 
sea  cliff  that  probably  marked  the  edge  of  the  inland 
advance  of  the  marine  deposits  was  uplifted  at  least 
900  m  (3000  feet)  from  its  former  sub-sea  level  ele- 
vation. In  the  Oli\e  \'iew  area,  the  eastern  Santa  Su- 
sana fault  places  marine  beds  of  Pliocene  age  over 
the  Pacoima  Formation  of  middlc(?)  Pleistocene  age.

Reverse-fault  displacement  of  the  surface  on  which  the 
Pacoima  Foimation  may  have  been  deposited  is  per- 
haps more  than  225  m  (750  feet)  to  the  south. 

The  north-dipping  Olive  View  fault  shows 
Pacoima  Formation(?)  fauitcd-up  at  least  10  m  (30 
feet)  against  older  alluvium  of  late  (?)  Pleis- 
tocene age.  In  the  Foothill  Frec\\a&gt;'  north  of  the  Syl- 
mar  segment,  the  angular  unconformity  between  older 
alluvium  and  a  Pliocene  sequence  is  reverse-faulted  at 
least  30  m  (100  feet)  vertically.  The  angular  uncon- 
formity is  along  the  bedrock  surface  of  the  Sylmar 
inlier.  This  surface  may  have  been  uplifted  a  maximum 
of  400-425  m  (1300-1400  feet)  from  sea  level  during 
middle-to-late  Pleistocene  time  if  the  surface  is  similar 
to  known  marine  terraces  in  the  coastal  area  which  are 
uplifted  to  about  that  elevation,  and  in  the  Palos 
V^erdes  Hills  arc  known  to  be  about  400,000  years  old. 

Pre-earthquake  scarps  along  this  fault  and  the 
Sylmar  and  Mission  Wells  segments  are  delineated  by 
topography  of  the  1953  and  older  San  Fernando  quad- 
rangle maps  of  the  U.  S.  Geological  Survey,  implying 
that  the  scarps  are  relatively  young.  The  apparent 
scarp  along  a  part  of  the  Sylmar  segment  may  be  8  m 
(25  feet)  or  more  in  height. 

Complexity.  Large-scale  mapping  during  the 
present  study  delineated  faults  of  the  area  more  pre- 
cisely than  previous  work,  but  the  fault  pattern  is 
complex,  as  is  illustrated  by  the  tangle  of  faults  exposed 


in  freeway  and  other  cuts  in  the  Mission  Hills  area. 
The  problem  of  mapping  faults  is  made  even  greater 
by  a  widespread  alluvial  cover  and  commonly  a  grad- 
ual change  in  lithology  among  the  Cenezoic  forma- 
tions that  makes  differentiation  difficult. 

Artificially  cut  frrotmd.  Many  of  the  prominent 
ground  ruptures  along  some  faults  appeared  only 
\\herc  those  faults  were  exf&gt;osed  in  artificially  cut 
ground  (for  example,  the  principal  fault  of  the  Reser- 
voir segment  in  the  Mission  Hills). 

Possible  subtle  effects.  Ground  cracking  in  al- 
luvium and  extensive  damage  to  the  San  Fernando 
Juvenile  Hall  and  vicinity  from  liquefaction  during 
shaking  may  also  be  subtle  effects  of  faulting.  For 
example,  if  faulting  in  bedrock  dissipated  upward 
into  alluvium,  shaking  along  the  trend  of  the  faulting 
at  the  ground  surface  may  have  been  amplified.  Also 
involved  in  tectonic  activity  here  may  be  further  fold- 
ing of  the  Mission  Hills  syncline. 

Other  street  and  ground  cracks  on  the  gently 
sloping  Sylmar  inlier  also  may  have  resulted  from  the 
effects  of  faulting  of  various  intensities  at  various 
depths  beneath  the  ground  surface,  especially  along 
bedding  planes  of  the  Saugus  Formation. 

The  earthquake  illustrated  a  need  to  understand 
how  the  effects  of  various  faulting  in  bedrock  are 
amplified  upward  to  the  surface  in  alluvium.

CHAPTER    7 


Surface  Effects  and  Related  Geology  of  the  San  Fernando  Earthquake 
in  the  Foothill  Region  Between  Little  Tujunga  and  Wilson  Canyons 


by  Allan  G.  Barrows  ' 


ABSTRACT 

Surface  faulting  exhibiting  both  left-lateral  and  dip- 
slip  components  of  displacement  along  the  Tujunga  seg- 
ment of  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone  produced  abundant 
scarps,  cracks,  and  ridges  at  the  base  of  the  foothills  be- 
tween Little  Tujunga  Canyon  and  Pacoima  Wash.  Detailed 
geological  mapping  has  shown  that  the  Tujunga  fault  seg- 
ment of  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone  could  have  been 
recognized  from  natural  as  well  as  artificial  exposures 
prior  to  the  earthquake.  The  measured  dip  varies  from  10° 
to  50°  north  along  the  segment.  Trenches  across  the  earth- 
quake scarps  revealed  a  record  of  previous  faulting  be- 
tween alluvial  materials  and  overriding  Tertiary  sediment- 
ary rocks.  In  one  trench  near  the  mouth  of  Lopez  Canyon, 
the  Tertiary  rocks  have  been  thrust  over  the  alluvium  more 
than  13  m  (43  feet).  Also  exposed  in  this  trench  is  a  record 
of  previous  faulting  of  slope  wash  deposits  over  alluvium 
suggestive  of  very  youthful  activity  along  the  Tujunga  seg- 
ment. 

Within  the  foothills,  surface  faulting  took  place  dis- 
continuously  along  the  Kagel  fault,  along  the  Oak  Hill 
fault  and  others  that  parallel  the  bedding  planes  of  en- 
closing strata,  and  along  other  minor  faults  of  various 
orientations.  At  several  places  along  the  trend  of  the 
Kagel  fault,  scarps  formed  that  are  not  above  the  actual 
fault  trace  itself.  They  may  represent  new  faults  that  de- 
veloped in  response  to  some  conditions  unique  to  this 
earthquake. 

Landslides,  rockfolls,  and  other  forms  of  slope  failure 
in  the  terrain  north  of  the  Tujunga  segment  resulted  from 
severe  ground  motion  and  surface  faulting.  The  lithology 
of  the  underlying  rocks,  as  well  as  the  steepness  of  the 
topography,  exerted  control  over  the  localization  of  land- 
slides. Spectacular  shattered  ridge  tops  are  locally  abun- 
dant and  widespread  within  the  foothill  region.  These  fea- 
tures, which  resemble  plowed  ground,  are  localized  where 
thin  soil  or  terrace  deposits  cover  sharp  ridges  or  peaks  in 
the  underlying  sedimentary  rocks. 

Damage  due  to  surface  faulting  was  restricted  to  dis- 
ruption of  roods  and  utilities  and  affected  only  a  few  build- 
ings. Most  damage  to  structures  resulted  from  severe 
ground  movement  although  londsliding,  especially  in  Kagel 
Canyon,  and  surface  cracking  resulting  from  differential 
settlement  of  artificial  fill  were  responsible  for  a  signifi- 
cant amount  of  damage. 

With  the  exception  of  surface  faulting  on  the  Vet- 
erans fault,  numerous  slope  failures  and,  locally,  shattered 
ridges,  the  effects  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  on  the 
surficial   geology  along   the  mountain   front  between   Pa-

coima  Canyon  and  Wilson  Canyon  are  rather  slight  com- 
pared to  the  damage  to  man-made  structures.  East  of  the 
Veterans  Administration  Hospital,  the  well-defined  scarp 
of  the  Veterans  fault  can  be  traced  for  300  m  (1000  feet) 
across  graded  bedrock  surfaces  parpllel  to  bedding  in  the 
Saugus  Formation.  South  of  the  fault,  terrace  deposits  have 
been  dropped  down  4  to  6  m  (15  to  20  feet)  as  a  result 
of  previous  fault  movements.  The  discontinuous  western 
portion  of  the  Veterans  fault  can  be  followed  120  m  (400 
feet)  beyond  the  clearly  developed  scarp  to  Condlewood 
Drive.  Surface  faulting,  which  may  or  may  not  be  along  a 
continuation  of  the  Veterans  fault,  is  expressed  as  a  low 
scarp  in  old  alluvial  fan  deposits  west  of  Condlewood 
Drive.  This  fault  could  be  traced  to  within  390  m  (1280 
feet)  of  the  collapsed  Veterans  Administration  Hospital. 
Between  Loop  Canyon,  north  of  the  Veterans  Admin- 
istration Hospital,  and  Olive  View,  no  reverse  or  thrust 
fault  of  the  Sierra  Madre  system  is  exposed  between  the 
basement  complex  and  the  Pleistocene  sedimentary  rocks. 
Certain  topographic  and  structural  geologic  features  in 
this  vicinity  are  interpreted  in  this  report  as  implying  the 
presence  of  a  fault  along  the  base  of  the  foothills  between 
Olive  View  and  May  Canyon.  There  was  no  surface  fault- 
ing along  the  trend  of  this  conjectural  fault  or  along  the 
actual  contact  between  the  basement  rocks  and  the  sedi- 
mentary rocks  north  of  the  fault. 


Since  it  deals  with  the  ereology  and  surface  ef- 
fects of  two  areas  of  unequal  size  and  dissimilar  de- 
velopment of  surface  effects,  this  paper  is  divided 
into  two  sections.  The  most  convenient  dividing  line 
between  these  two  areas  is  Pacoima  Canyon  and 
Wash. 

Field  work  began  immediately  after  the  earth- 
quake in  the  areas  of  most  abundant  surface  effects, 
especially  where  surface  breaks  due  to  faulting  were 
concentrated.  Initially,  mapping  of  the  surface  effects 
was  emphasized  because  these  effects  are  subject  to 
modification  or  destruction  by  weather  and  the  ac- 
tivities of  man.  When  most  of  the  effects  had  been 
recorded  (Barrows  and  others,  1971),  the  emphasis 
shifted  to  detailed  geological  mapping  so  that  the 
observed  effects  could  be  related  to  the  underlying 
geology.  The  two  contiguous  areas  discussed  in  this 
paper  comprise  about  10  square  miles,  most  of  which 
is  east  of  Pacoima  Wash.  Mapping  was  done  on  aerial 
photos  at  scales  ranging  from  1 :  2400  to  1 :  6000.  Num- 
bers in  parentheses  within  the  text  refer  to  localities  in

FOOTHILL  REGION  BETWEEN  LITTLE  TUJUNGA 
CANYON  AND  PACOIMA  WASH 
Geologic  Fromework 

Two  major  components  dominate  the  structural 
framework  of  this  area:  the  series  of  discontinuous, 
north\\ard-dipping  thrust  faults  of  the  Sierra  Madre 
fault  zone  and  the  .Merrick  syncline  (plate  2).  The 
folding  of  the  Tertiary  and  Quaternary  sedimentary 
units  into  the  partially  overturned  Merrick  syncline 
provided  the  primary  structural  control  for  the  cur- 
rent topography  in  the  foothill  region.  The  details 
of  the  formation  of  this  syncline  are  not  pertinent  to 
the  subject  of  this  paper,  but  the  coincidence  of  the 
axial  trace  of  this  fold  to  the  trend  of  the  thnist  faults 
to  the  north  implies  a  similar  orientation  of  the 
stresses  that  produced  both  of  these  structures. 

The  thrust  faults  of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone 
include,  from  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  to  Pacoima 
Canyon:  Little  Tujunga  fault,  Lopez  fault,  and  Buck 
Canyon  fault.  These  structures  separate  pre-Tertiary 
rocks  of  the  basement  complex  on  the  north  from 
terrestrial  sediments  of  the  Saugus  and  Pacoima  For- 
mations on  the  south.  Where  exposed,  the  faults  range 
in  dip  from  10°  to  60°  N.  but  generally  dip  less  than 
30°.  In  a  few  places  (for  example,  on  the  west  side  of 
upper  Kagel  Canyon),  south  dips  can  be  measured  on 
fault  planes  at  the  contact  bct\veen  the  Saugus  For- 
luation  and  the  overlying  rocks  of  the  basement  com- 
plex. These  particular  attitudes  are  best  explained  as 
resulting  from  large-scale  landsliding  in  the  vicinit&gt;' 
of  the  fault  trace.  The  upper  Kagel  Canyon  locality 
has  been  interpreted  as  such  (plate  2).  Oakeshott 
(1958,  p.  93)  suggested  that  the  anomalous  reversed 
dip  on  the  Buck  Canyon  fault  at  the  head  of  Lopez 
Canyon  could  also  be  the  result  of  such  landslide 
effects. 

.\s  plate  2  shows,  very  large  landslides  are  a  char- 
acteristic feature  of  the  basement  terrain  north  of  the 
Sierra  Madre  fault  zone,  as  well  as  across  the  trace  of 
the  faults  themselves.  No  evidence  \\'as  found  during 
the  field  work  that  would  be  helpful  in  determining  the 
actual  age  of  any  of  these  large  slides.  Extending  from 
the  vicinity  of  the  large  composite  landslides  at  the 
head  of  Marek  Can\on  arc  several  stream  canyons 
that  arc  choked  with  great  volumes  of  unsorted  an- 
gular debris  that  evidcntU-  represent  debris  flow  de- 
posits. These  large  tlcbris  flows  formed  along  the  steep 
mountain  front  in  basement  rocks  as  additional  mani- 
festations of  the  conditions  under  which  the  large 
landslides  formed.  It  inay  be  that  large  landslides  pro- 
vided a  supply  of  loose  material  saturated  by   rains 


during  a  prolonged  wet  period  and  that  a  large  earth- 
quake triggered  the  debris  flows.  Their  spatial  asso- 
ciation with  faults  of  the  Sierra  Madre  system  lends 
support  to  this  h\pothcsis.  The  well-preserved  aspect 
of  the  deposits,  expressed  as  relatively  level  surfaces 
into  which  modern  streams  have  made  little  headway, 
suggests  youthfulness.  However,  as  Howell  (1949,  p. 
46)  suggested,  it  may  be  that  the  deposits  arc  so  po- 
rous that  streams  have  tended  to  cut  their  channels 
in  the  Saugus  Formation  where  runoff  is  possible.  If 
this  is  the  reason  for  the  unusual  topography  on  and 
adjacent  to  these  deposits,  their  \'outhfulness  may  be 
more  apparent  than  real. 

The  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9, 
1971,  dramaticall\-  revealed  the  presence  of  a  pre- 
viously unrecognized  member  of  the  Sierra  Madre 
family  of  northward-dipping  thrust  faults — the  San 
Fernando  fault  zone.  Faults  of  this  zone,  however, 
rather  than  separating  basement  rocks  from  younger 
sedimentary  rocks,  transect  the  sedimentary  units 
themselves.  During  the  field  in\cstigations,  the  north- 
ern faults  of  the  Sierra  Madre  fault  zone  (Little  Tu- 
junga fault,  Lopez  fault.  Buck  Canyon  fault)  were 
carcfull\-  inspected  for  features  indicati\c  of  surficial 
movement  during  the  earthquake,  but  no  e\idence  was 
found.  The  surface  effects  that  developed  along  the 
San  Fernando  fault  zone  to  the  south  provide  an 
abundance  of  features  which  are  described  and  dis- 
cussed below.

mouths  of  Lopez  (photo  2),  Kagel,  and  Little  Tu- 
junga Canyons  and  disappear  near  the  mouth  of  Cas- 
sara  Canyon.  In  some  places  (93,  118),  the  breaks  of 
the  Tujunga  segment  define  a  single  continuous  fault- 
line  scarp,  whereas  in  other  places  the  segment  con- 
sists of  numerous  interrupted,  locally  multiple  (104) 
scarps  and  cracks  that  vet)-  closely  approximate  the 
change  in  slope  at  the  base  of  the  foothills.  Asym- 
metrical compression  ridges  and  mole  tracks  are  the 
southernmost  surface  features  of  thrust  faulting.  Lo- 
cally, abundant  tensional  cracks  and  high-angle  fault 
scarps  are  common  immediately  north  of  the  thrust 
fault  scarps  (94)  (photo  3). 

The  scarps  of  the  Tujunga  segment  attain  their 
greatest  height,  85  to  90  cm  (2.8  to  3  feet),  near  the 
western  end  (90).  In  general,  the  scarps  range  be- 
tween 40  cm  (16  inches)  and  50  cm  (20  inches)  high 
over  their  most  continuous  stretches.  As  is  the  case 
with  the  Oak  Hill  and  ^''eterans  faults,  the  best  or 


sharpest  scarps  developed  where  artificially  graded  or 
leveled  land  surfaces  were  intersected  by  the  faults. 

The  compressiona!  aspect  of  the  thrust  fault 
scarps  is  readily  observable  at  many  places  (118,  104). 
Direct  measurement  of  the  amount  of  shortening 
across  the  fault  is  only  locally  possible,  however.  The 
best  place  to  measure  shortening  is  where  there  has 
been  displacement  nf  linear  man-made  features.  One 
such  place  where  the  shortening  was  measured  is  in 
the  orange  groves  of  .Middle  Ranch  (118).  The  aver- 
age shortening  of  two  lines  measured  in  the  groves  on 
the  east  side" of  Little  Tujunga  Wash  is  1  m  (3.3 
feet).  On  the  west  side  of  the  wash,  measurement  of 
the  change  in  the  spacing  of  the  trees  in  three  rows 
across  the  fault  scarp  averages  1.2  m  (3.9  feet). 

A  noteworthy  example  of  horizontal  movement 
in  the  direction  of  the  horizontal  component  of  slip 
is  provided  bv  the  offset  of  grooves  in  a  road  in  the 
trailer  park  Mest  of  Lopez  Canyon  (T  8;  also  see  map

in  plnrc  4).  By  coincidence,  the  road  is  oriented  paral- 
lel with  the  horizontal  component  of  slip.  The 
grooves,  which  are  nearly  perpendicular  to  the  road, 
were  offset  159  cm  (5.2  feet)  when  the  road  pave- 
ment moved  northward  relative  to  the  trailer  pad 
where  portions  of  the  grooves  remain.  That  this 
measurement  does  not  represent  the  exact  amount  of 
shortening  is  suggested  by  the  measurement  of  the 
ciiange  in  length  of  a  steel  pipe  on  the  southeast  side 
of  tlic  road  (plate  4).  This  pipe  was  buckled  and 
broken  and  appears  to  have  been  shortened  119  cm 
(^.9  feet)  where  the  fault  crosses  it.  This  measure- 
ment is  similar  to  that  in  the  orange  groves  of  Middle 
Rancli  wiiicli  implies  that  the  maximum  amount  of 
shortening  was  similar  toward  both  ends  of  the  Tu- 
junga fault  segment. 

The  horizontal  component  of  slip  for  faults  along 
the  Tujunga  segment  is  predominantly  left  lateral  (89, 
92,  1 17),  except  near  its  eastern  end  in  tlie  vicinit\'  of 
Little  Tujunga  Can\on  (118).  A  detailed  analysis  of 
displacements  and  slip  along  the  San  Fernando  fault 
zone  is  presented  b\  Sharp  (this  Bulletin). 

An  attempt  was  made  to  measure  the  total  amount 
of  compression  and  tension  expressed  by  the  surface 


features  north  of  the  thrust  in  a  small  canyon  N.  15° 
W.  of  the  Pacoima  Lutheran  Hospital  (105).  From 
south  to  north  across  a  gently  south-sloping  area  be- 
ginning at  the  foot  of  the  fault  scarp,  compressional 
features,  similar  to  humps  or  waves,  were  measured 
over  a  distance  of  30  m  (99  feet)  and  include  six 
scarps  or  scarplets  totaling  approximately  a  meter 
(3.28  feet)  of  shortening.  Next,  northward  is  an  18 
m  (59  foot)  zone  devoid  of  features  and  then  a  33.8 
m  (111-foot)  zone  of  35  open  cracks  over  which  the 
extension  represented  by  openings  totals  44.6  cm  (1.5 
feet).  Two  possible  explanations  of  the  fact  that  the 
measured  extension  is  less  than  half  of  the  compression 
are:  the  remainder  of  the  difference  could  be  absorbed 
in  the  loose  alluvium  that  underlies  the  entire  zone  or, 
alternatively,  additional  extension  could  have  occurred 
on  the  faults  upslope  on  the  hills  north  of  the  frontal 
scarps  (plate  3). 

The  low  to  moderate  dip  of  the  southernmost  fault 
breaks  along  the  Tujunga  segment,  ranging  from 
about  10°  to  50°  N.,  can  be  observed  where  the  trace 
of  the  fault  crosses  stream  canyons  (91,  95,  97).  Im- 
mediately north  of  the  compressional  scarp  (94,  105), 
high-angle,  even  vertical  faults  are  locally  common 
and  probably  represent  tensional  cracks  near  the  lip 
of  the  thrust  (photo  3).  Accurate  near-surface  meas- 
urement of  the  attitude  of  the  fault  plane  was  made 
in  several  trenches  (T3,  T4,  T8)  (California  Division 
of  Mines  and  Geology,  this  Bulletin).  Where  details 
were  revealed  in  trenches,  the  fault  plane  was  found 
to  coincide  with  the  attitude  of  the  bedding  in  the 
Modelo  Formation  (T3,  T8).  Very  close  to  the 
surface,  however,  the  fault  plane  flattens  out  (T8, 
plate  4)  or  even  becomes  slightly  south-dipping 
(T4). 

Geology.  Could  or  should  the  Tujunga  fault 
segment  have  been  recognized  by  geologists  before 
the  earthquake  dramatically  demonstrated  its  pres- 
ence? A  brief  review  of  earlier  geological  studies  is 
given  below  to  show  that,  although  some  geologists 
suspected  or  suggested  the  presence  of  a  fault  near 
here,  no  definitive,  unambiguous  evidence  was  discov- 
ered. Not  having  the  benefit  of  hindsight,  of  course, 
their  purposes  were  different  from  the  present  one. 
The  following  account  of  previous  work  provides  a 
background  for  the  discussion  of  those  natural  and 
artificial  exposures  that  revealed  the  presence  of  the 
fault  before  the  earthquake. 

Useful  geologic  mapping  of  this  area  can  be  consid- 
ered to  have  begun  \\ith  the  work  of  Kew  (1924). 
His  map  (scale  1:62,500)  differentiates  the  major  rock 
units  in  the  region  but  shows  no  fault  along  the  base 
of  the  foothills.  This  fact  was  noted  by  Miller  (1928), 
who  placed  a  fault  along  the  base  of  the  foothills  on 
his  sketch  map.  Miller  (1928,  p.  210),  after  pointing 
out  that  evidence  for  the  existence  of  a  fault  along 
the  base  of  the  foothills  was  not  as  good  as  that  for 
other  faults  farther  north,  said,  "but  it  scarcely  seems 
probable  that  the  straight,  bold  scarp,  rising  hundreds 
of  feet  for  a  distance  of  five  miles,  could  have  resulted 
wholly  from  erosion."  Miller's  larger  scale  map 
(1934,  scale  1:84,000)  also  shows  this  suggested  fault.

Mason  Hill  (1930)  published  the  first  detailed  map 
of  the  region  (scale  1: 37,500)  containing  work  done  in 
1928  with  H.  J.  Buddenhagen.  Hill  did  not  show  any 
fault  that  coincides  with  the  Tujunga  fault  segment. 
Aware  of  the  possibility  of  faulting  south  of  the  foot- 
hills, however.  Hill  placed  a  conjectural  "Tujunga 
fault?"  on  his  map  several  thousand  feet  south  of  the 
base  of  the  hills.  Insufficient  evidence  forced  him  to 
state  (1930,  p.  153)  that  "if  a  fault  is  present,  the  char- 
acter of  the  displacement  is  unknown,  but  by  analogy 
to  the  other  structures  [farther  north]  one  reverse 
fault  is  tentatively  shown"  on  his  geologic  cross  sec- 
tion. 

Oakeshott  published  several  maps  which  include  the 
area  traversed  by  the  Tujunga  fault  segment  (1937, 
1954,  1958),  but  he  did  not  indicate  any  faults  at  the 
base  of  the  foothills  on  any  of  them.  White  (1937), 
who  carefully  mapped  (scale  1:24,000)  the  area  be- 
tween Little  Tujunga  Canyon  and  Pacoima  Wash, 
discussed  the  evidence  for  a  "possible  Foothill  fault" 
along  the  base  of  the  hills.  As  earlier  workers  had. 
White  (1937,  p.  33)  noticed  the  physiographic  evidence 
for  a  "possible  fault  at  or  close  to  the  break  in  slope" 
and  observed  that  "this  line  cuts  across  the  horizons  in 
the  Modelo  to  some  extent,  and  is,  therefore,  not  due 
to  mere  differential  erosion."  Circumstantial  evidence, 
which  White  (1937,  p.  33)  believed  implied  faulting, 
includes  his  observation  that  Kagel  and  Little  Tujunga 
Canyons  "widen  out  to  the  north"  which  "suggests  an 
upward  movement  to  the  south"  as  does  the  presence 
of  multiple  terrace  levels  within  the  foothills.  The 
most  positive  evidence  that  White  found  remained, 
until  the  earthquake,  the  only  direct  observation  of 
actual  faults  along  what  is  now  called  the  Tujunga 
fault  segment.  Just  west  of  Lopez  Canyon,  White 
(1937,  p.  33,  plate  1)  mapped  "adobe-like  terrace  ma- 
terial .  .  .  apparently  faulted  down  on  the  south 
against  Modelo." 

Although  White  speculated  on  a  "Foothill  fault", 
his  map  shows  only  the  small  portion  west  of  Lopez 
Canyon  that  was  actually  exposed.  Credit  is  due  to  an 
undergraduate  (George,  1937)  writing  his  senior  thesis 


on  the  geology  of  the  area  between  Little  Tujunga 
and  Lopez  Canyons  for  producing  a  map  showing  the 
closest  approximation  to  the  actual  trace  of  the  Tu- 
junga fault  segment.  More  willing  to  speculate  than 
his  predecessors  (and  successors  as  well,  with  the  ex- 
ception of  Jahns  and  others,  1970)  and  with  refresh- 
ing directness,  he  placed  a  "Foothill  fault"  on  his 
map  (scale  1:24,000)  basing  his  decision  (1937,  p.  13) 
upon:  the  "remarkable  straightness  of  the  front  of  the 
foothill  range"  and  the  "relief  of  the  relatively  soft 
and  easily  eroded  Modelo  shales  which  make  up  the 
fore  part  of  the  foothills,"  which  imply  a  fault  scarp. 

Larger  scale  mapping  by  Howell  (1949,  1954,  scale 
1:12,000)  of  the  entire  area  containing  the  Tujunga 
segment  and  by  Merifield  (1958,  scale  1:12,000)  of  a 
portion  of  this  area  failed  to  turn  up  evidence  for  a 
fault  here.  Howell  noticed  the  "remarkably  straight" 
edge  of  the  foothills  north  of  Tujunga  Valley  (1949, 
p.  82)  as  earlier  workers  had.  He  stated,  however 
(1949,  p.  83),  that  "because  of  the  lack  of  positive  evi- 
dence for  its  existence,  no  fault  has  been  indicated  on 
the  map  or  sections." 

Detailed  mapping  of  the  geology  along  the  Tu- 
junga fault  segment,  mostly  on  vertical  aerial  photo- 
graphs at  a  scale  of  1:2400,  has  shown  that  natural 
exposures  provide  mostly  indirect  but,  locally,  very 
compelling  evidence  for  both  the  existence  and  the 
youthfulness  of  faulting  along  the  segment.  Artificial 
exposures  and  subsurface  information  provide  clear- 
cut  evidence  of  faulting,  had  they  been  observed  and 
analyzed  before  the  earthquake.  The  above  comment 
applies  to  the  Tujunga  segment  and  not  to  the  Lake- 
view  segment  (Kahle,  this  Bulletin).  It  is  likely  that, 
if  work  had  been  done  along  the  entire  stretch  be- 
tween Big  Tujunga  Canyon  and  Pacoima  Wash  by 
one  person  prior  to  the  earthquake,  the  evidence  ex- 
posed along  the  Lakeview  thrust  would  have  lent 
heavy  support  toward  assuming  a  conjectural  fault 
along  the  base  of  the  foothills  where  the  Tujunga 
fault  segment  broke  the  surface. 

As  discussed  above.  White  (1937)  discovered 
some  of  the  best  evidence  for  faulting  along  the  hill-

indeed  rest  upon  alluvium.  Photo  taken  by  F.

slopes  west  of  Lopez  Canvnn  Cphoto  4).  Exposed 
above  the  level  of  the  modern  alluvium  are  remnants 
of  a  distinctive,  mappable  deposit  of  poorly  sorted, 
weathered,  older  colkivium  and  alluvium  possibly  of 
debris  flow  oripin.  Both  White  (19^7')  and  Howell 
(1949)  mapped  this  unit,  but  only  White  placed  a 
fault  bervvcen  it  and  the  Modelo  sandstone  to  the 
north.  In  addition  to  the  easily  recognizable  charac- 
ter of  this  material,  an  abrupt  change  in  the  bearing 
of  the  gullies  that  dissect  the  slopes  from  S.  20°  E. 
in  the  steeper  Modelo  sediments  to  S.  35°-45°  W.  in 
the  older  alluvium  at  the  contact  of  the  r\vo  hints  at 
the  change  in  geological  conditions.  An  accurate  plot 
of  the  trend  of  the  contact  across  the  topography 
between  the  Modelo  Formation  and  the  older  allu- 
vium at  one  locality  in  particular  (photo  4)  demon- 
strates tiiat  the  Modelo  sediments  must  indeed  overlie 
the  alluvium. 

The  presence  of  terrace  deposits,  which  were 
discussed  in  detail  bv  White  (1937,  p.  18-20)  and  by 
Howell  (1949,  p.  44-48),  at  various  levels  within  the 
foothill  region  in  general  and  along  the  frontal  slope 
in  particular  (plate  2)  indicates  uplift  and  implies  re- 
peated faulting  to  accomplish  it.  The  distinctive  red- 
weathering  unit  which  has  been  mapped  as  older  col- 
luvial  deposits  beneath  the  Tujunga  segment  (plate 
2)  was  mapped  by  White  (1937,  plate  1)  as  an 
"adobe  conglomerate,"  which  he  suggested  may  be  a 
residual  ropsoil.  Unfortimately,  no  information  on  the 
actual  ages  of  the  terrace  deposits  or  older  colluvial 
debris  is'  yet  available  that  could  make  it  possible  to 
estimate  rates  of  uplift.  Gullying  of  an  old  bulldozer 
cut  in  some  of  the  loM'er  elevation  (that  is,  youngest) 
terrace  deposits  exposed  white  Modelo  sandstone 
overlying  unconsolidated  coarse  boulderv  terrace  de- 
posits atone  place  (103)  which  is  approximately  45  m 
(150  feet)  north  of  the  southernmost  fault  scarp 
formed  during  the  earthquake.  This  may  indicate  the 
presence  of  an  imbricate,  older  fault  north  of  the 
Tujunga  fault  zone. 

Undoubtedly,  the  best  artificial  exposure  of  the 
Tujunga  fault  along  the  entire  segment  was  created 
during  construction  of  the  Blue  Star  Trailer  Park  west 
of  Lopez  Canyon.  Perhaps  it  escaped  the  notice  of 
geologists  because  it  may  not  have  remained  open 
very  loner  before  being  covered  bv  a  wall  of  ma- 
sonry. The  fault  zone  is  openly  displayed  there  once 
again  because  the  wall,  which  was  broken  at  the  time 
of  the  earthquake,  has  been  removed  (map  in  plate  4). 

A  few  feet  west  of  this  cut,  the  California  Divi- 
sion of  Mines  and  Geology  excavated  a  17.7  m  (58 
foot)  trench  across  the  70  cm  (2.3  foot)  high  earth- 
quake scarp  to  expose  the  geology  (T8:  California 
Division  of  Mines  and  Geology,  this  Bulletin,  photo 
5).  This  trench  exposed  a  section  similar  to  the  arti- 
ficial exposure  in  the  Blue  Star  Trailer  Park.  A  de- 
tailed sketch  of  the  western  wall  of  the  trench  and  a 
locality  map  of  the  area  are  given  in  the  pocket  (plate 
4).  It  was  possible  to  investigate  the  geology  in  great 
detail  because  the  moist,  weakly  to  moderately  ce- 
mented units  were  easily  cleaned  and  trimmed  on  the 
walls  of  the  trench.

The  fault  scarp  was  formed  in  an  area  of  asphalt 
paving  that  covers  a  graded  bedrock  surface  on  sedi- 
mentary rocks  of  the  Modelo  Formation.  The 
straightforward  geology  in  the  vicinit&gt;-  of  the  scarp, 
revealed  by  the  trenching,  consists  of  two  fault  planes 
or  planar  zones.  The  northernmost  of  these  faults 
parallels  the  strike  (N.  80°  W.)  and  dip  (32°  N.)  of 
the  Alodelo  sandstone  and  siltstone  layers  as  a  zone 
of  moist  brown  clayey,  gougelike  material.  Slicken- 
sides,  which  plunge  22°  in  a  N.  50°  E.  direction,  were 
found  on  the  upper  surface  of  this  material. 

Most  of  the  displacement  apparently  took  place 
along  the  northern  fault  plane.  The  southern  fault 
plane  is  expressed  as  a  thinner  zone  of  loose  material, 
and  it  was  not  possible  to  tell  how  much  displacement 
occurred  along  it.  The  change  in  dip  of  the  fault  near 
the  surface  is  a  result  of  the  "falling  over"  of  the  un- 
supported upper  sedimentary  layers  above  the  fault. 

The  trench  revealed  that  the  faulting  in  this 
earthquake  took  place  within  the  Modelo  Formation 
rather  than  between  Modelo  strata  and  alluvium  as 
was  seen  to  be  the  case  at  several  other  places  along 
the  Tujunga  segment  (T3,  T4;  also  see  discussion  hy 
Kahle  of  relations  along  the  Lakeview  segment,  this 
Bulletin).  Faulting  of  this  type  is  most  likely  not  a 
unique  feature  here  but  probably  has  occurred  else- 
where (106)  along  the  segment.  The  reason  for  fault- 
ing of  this  type,  as  well  as  for  the  development  of  a 
well-defined  scarp  here,  may  be  related  to  the  fact 
that  the  bedrock  surface  had  been  graded  before  the 
earthquake.  In  general,  well-defined  scarps  elsewhere 
are  restricted  to  such  graded  surfaces  where  loose 
alluvium  or  soil  had  been  removed.  This  aspect  of 
scarp  development  is  especially  well  exemplified  by 
the  Oak  Hill  (Tl)  and  Veterans  faults  (47).  It  is 
possible  that  the  faults  exposed  in  trench  8  formed 
where  the\'  did  with  respect  to  the  Modelo/alluvium 
contact  because  the  toe  of  the  original  hillslope,  which 
was  located  probably  about  1.5  m  (5  feet)  north  of

the  southern  end  of  the  trench,  had  been  cut  away 
during  grading  operations  and  the  faulting  took  a 
more  direct  route  to  the  surface. 

A  record  of  previous  faulting  on  the  Tujunga 
fault  is  dramatically  displayed  in  the  section  exposed 
in  trench  8  (plate  4).  The  complexirv  of  the  deforma- 
tion in  the  generally  soft,  thinlv  bedded  Modelo  sedi- 
ments in  the  central  part  of  the  trench  attests  to  re- 
peated fault  movements.  The  axial  traces  of  several  of 
the  folds  shown  in  the  sketch  plunge  from  4°  to  8° 
in  a  N.  55°-60°  W.  direction  reflecting  the  lateral  as 
well  as  the  horizontal  components  of  earlier  move- 
ments on  this  fault  zone.  Further  record  of  repeated 
earlier  movements  is  given  in  the  relation  of  the  de- 
formed Modelo  Formation  and  the  underlying  older 
alluvial  debris.  A  cross  trench  (plate  4)  was  dug  near 
the  scarp  Avhere,  at  a  depth  of  more  than  4  m  (13 
feet),  the  contact  between  Modelo  sandstone  and  allu- 
vial material  was  encountered.  The  Modelo  Formation 
has  overridden  the  alluvial  material  for  at  least  13.1  m 
(43  feet).  The  displacement  on  this  fault  is  probably 
much  greater  as  suggested  by  the  uniformity  of  its 
dip,  projecting  the  evidence  in  the  cross  trench  to  the 
section  of  trench  8.  By  analogy  with  discoveries  along 
the  Lakeview  segment  (Kahle,  this  Bulletin),  the  total 
displacement  along  the  Tujunga  fault  segment  may 
approach  hundreds  of  feet.  Unfortunately  no  datable 
materal  was  found  in  the  alluvium  of  trench  8;  there- 
fore, the  pre-earthquake  faulting  can  only  be  termed 
youthful. 

At  the  southern  end  of  trench  8,  the  decurved  as- 
pect of  the  near-surface  portion  of  the  pre-earthquake 
fault  separating  underlying  alluvium  from  debris  of 
the  Modelo  Formation  and  older  slope  wash  deposits 
from  the  hill  which  extended  this  far  south  before 
grading  is  very  similar  to  the  shape  of  the  earthquake 
fault  plane  exposed  in  trench  4  (T4)  west  of  trench  8 
(T8)  at  the  base  of  a  natural  slope.  Trench  4  was  dug 
across  a  60  cm  (2-foot)  high  scarp  in  soil  and  exposed 
the  near-surface  aspect  of  the  fault  plane  that  sepa- 
rates debris  of  the  Alodelo  Formation  containing  shale 
chips,  pebbles,  and  cobbles  on  the  north  from  older 
alluvium  which  is  poorly  bedded.  The  fault  plane  dips 
north  15°  near  the  northern  end  of  the  trench,  bends 
over  near  the  surface,  and  dips  shallowly  southward, 
all  in  a  distance  of  1.8  to  2.4  m  (6  to  8  feet),  identical 
to  the  pre-earthquake  fault  in  trench  8.  The  pre-earth- 
quake fault  exposed  in  trench  8  did  not  move  during 
the  1971  event,  but  it  separates  possible  slope  wash 
deposits  from  older  alluvium.  This  relationship  sug- 
gests very  young  faulting  because  of  the  easily  eroded 
nature  of  the  deposits  above  the  decurved  portion  of 
the  fault.  Bonilla  (1972;  in  press)  has  suggested  that 
surface  faulting  may  have  occurred  on  an  older  fault 
at  the  Oak  Hill  fault  (Tl),  north  of  trench  8  about 
915  m  (3000  feet),  about  200  years  ago.  A  wood 
sample  he  found  in  collapse-rubble  (?)  just  below  the 
buried  old  fault  scarp  in  a  trench  was  dated  by  the 
radiocarbon  method  as  being  less  than  200  }"ears  old. 
It  is  also  possible  but,  unfortunately,  not  as  neatly  in- 
dicated, that  faulting  this  recent  took  place  in  the  vi- 
cinity of  trench  8  and,  by  implication,  along  the  whole 
Tujunga  segment. 


Movement  on  the  Oak  Hill  fault  and  the  Tujunga 
fault  segment  took  place  during  the  1971  earthquake 
because  the  stresses  being  released  were  of  the  appro- 
priate orientation  to  involve  both  of  these  structures. 
Therefore,  it  is  not  unlikely  that,  if  the  older  buried 
fault  scarp  1.2  m  (4  feet)  north  of  the  Oak  Hill  fault 
moved  about  200  years  ago  as  suggested  by  Bonilla 
(1972;  in  press),  the  forces  responsible  for  such  move- 
ment similarly  affected  the  Tujunga  segment. 

A  much  simpler  geological  picture  was  revealed 
in  a  trench  (T3)  dug  north  of  Carl  Street  than  in  the 
other  previously  discussed  trenches.  The  trench  was 
cut  across  a  low  7.6  cm  (3-inch)  high  compression 
ridge  exposing  a  well-defined  single  fault  plane  that 
strikes  east-west  and  dips  44°  N.  parallel  with  the  bed- 
ding of  the  Modelo  Formation.  The  fault  juxtaposes 
shale  and  siltstone  on  the  north  against  poorly  sorted 
conglomerate  with  a  coarse  sandy  matrix  which  may 
represent  an  alluvial  fan  or  debris  flow  deposit. 

Surface  Faulting  North  of  the  Tujunga  Segment 

Oak  Hill  jault.  Surface  faulting  along  the  west- 
ern end  of  the  Lakeview  thrust  (Kahle,  this  Bulletin) 
crossing  Little  Tujunga  and  Kagel  Canyons,  about  366 
m  (1200  feet)  north  of  the  Tujunga  segment,  pro- 
duced a  scarp  which  is  almost  identical  to  the  Tujunga 
fault  segment  scarp  across  Little  Tujunga  Canyon. 

Faults  other  than  thrusts  were  also  active  during 
the  earthquake  at  places  away  from  the  major  zones 
of  thrusting.  A  type  of  fault  in  which  the  dip  and 
strike  of  the  fault  parallel  the  dip  and  strike  of  the 
enclosing  strata  is  known  as  a  bedding-plane  fault. 
Such  a  fault  is  the  north-dipping  Oak  Hill  fault  (Tl) 
(Kamb  and  others,  1971,  p.  51)  in  Lopez  Canyon 
(Tl,  photo  6)  where  a  very  prominent,  partly  over- 
hanging 80  cm  (32-inch)  high  scarp  formed.  A  de- 
tailed study  of  the  effects  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Oak 
Hill  fault,  reported  by  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey 
(1971,  p.  67-69),  showed  that  this  fault  also  had  a 
left-lateral  component  of  slip  averaging  80  cm  (32 
inches). 

A  sharply  defined  scarp  developed  only  over  a 
graded  bedrock  surface  for  a  length  of  45  m  (150 
feet)  although  surface  breakage  could  be  traced  for  al- 
most 245  m  (800  feet)  along  this  fault.  A  trench  about 
23  m  (75  feet)  east  of  the  well-defined  scarp  was  cut 
in  unconsolidated  alluvium  and  fill  across  a  mole  track 
or  surface  hump  of  the  Oak  Hill  fault.  Even  though 
the  ground  at  the  surface  was  cracked  and  \\-arped,  no 
evidence  of  faulting  was  seen  in  the  walls  of  the  trench. 
Evidently  movement  in  the  loose  material  is  distrib- 
uted in  such  a  way  that  it  escapes  detection  in  cross 
section.  A  lack  of  planar  marker  layers  (for  example, 
beds),  which  would  attest  to  offset,  is  a  primary-  rea- 
son for  failure  to  observe  the  faulting.  Elsewhere,  in 
several  trenches  across  scarps  of  the  Tujunga  segment 
in  a  field  east  of  the  mouth  of  Lopez  Canyon,  evi- 
dence for  faulting  was  lacking  where  the  trenches  dis- 
sected only  unconsolidated  soil,  slope  wash  debris,  or 
alluvium.  It  can  be  concluded  from  these  observations 
that  trenches  in  unconsolidated,  massive  or  unstrati- 
fied  materials  may  be  of  little  or  no  value  when  it 
comes  to  determining  whether  or  not  faulting  has  oc- 
curred.

The  north  side  of  the  Oak  Hill  fault  moved  up 
in  north-dipping  strata.  Elsewhere,  on  other  bedding- 
plane  faults  (98,100),  the  north  side  moved  down  in 
north-dipping  strata  by  amounts  equal  to  or  greater 
than  south-side  down  faults  (photo  7).  Faults  that 
transect  bedding,  the  most  important  of  which  is  the 
Kagci  fault  discussed  below,  were  also  active  during 
the  earthquake  (111;  101). 

Kagel  fault.  The  Kagel  fault,  originally  mapped 
and  named  by  Hill  (1930),  strikes  N.  75°  E.  across  the 
strike  of  the  bedding  in  both  the  Modelo  and  Tows- 
ley/Pico Formations,  as  well  as  across  the  contact  be- 
tween them  (plate  2).  During  the  earthquake,  the 
Kagel  fault  may  have  been  active  over  its  entire 
length;  but  surface  breaks  are  not  continuous  along 
its  trend.  The  dip  of  the  fault  varies  along  the  strike. 
Although  Hill  reported  a  75°  N.  dip  in  a  canyon  bot- 
tom about  610  m  (2000  feet)  east  of  Dexter  Park,  the 
exposure  from  which  he  determined  this  dip  could 


not  be  found.  The  fault  is  exposed,  however,  in  a 
roadcut  on  the  ridge  east  of  Dexter  Park.  At  this  lo- 
cality, the  fault,  which  dips  almost  vertically,  is  ex- 
pressed as  a  zone  of  gouge  separating  coarse  con- 
glomerate on  the  south  from  deformed  gray  sandstone 
on  the  north. 

White  (1937),  George  (1937),  and  Howell 
(1949)  all  considered  the  Kagel  fault  to  be  a  reverse 
fault  which  dips  about  60°s  in  the  vicinit&gt;'  of  Kagel 
Canyon.  Hill  (1930,  p.  152)  stated  simply,  without 
elaboration,  that  drag  effects  along  the  fault  sug- 
gested a  left-lateral  component  to  displacement  along 
the  Kagel  fault.  George  (1937,  p.  15)  also  considered 
that  a  lateral  component  to  the  faulting  was  likely. 
White  (1937,  p.  29)  and  Howell  (1949,  p.  83),  on  the 
other  hand,  considered  the  Kagel  fault  to  be  simply  a 
reverse  fault.  .Ml  of  these  workers  mapped  the  well- 
exposed  folds  in  Kagel  Canyon  which  are  spatially 
related  to  the  Kagel  fault  (plate  2),  as  did  Merifield

Photo  7.  North-dipping  bedding-plane  fault  in  sandstones  of  Towsley/ 
Pico  Formation  on  ridge  east  of  Indion  Canyon  (locality  98,  plate  3). 
Scarp  is  1  m  (3.2  feet)  high.  This  scarp  is  stratigraphically  very  close 
to  the  contact  with  the  overlying  Sougus  Formation.  Note  shattered 
ground  in  background. 


(1958),  who  arerued  that  these  folds  in  the  Modelo 
Formation  implied  strike-slip  movement  along  the 
Kagel  fault.  He  reasoned  (1958,  p.  44)  that,  if  the 
Kagel  fault  is  "assumed  to  be  a  reverse  fault  (that  is, 
a  fault  resulting  from  compression),  the  movement 
would  be  opposed  to  that  of  the  other  faults  in  the 
area,  in  which  north  has  exxlusivelv  moved  up.  If  on 
the  other  hand  it  is  a  normal  fault,  it  is  difficult  to 
explain  the  compression  folds  almost  certainly  related 
to  the  faulting.  Consequently,  left-lateral  strike-slip 
movement  best  explains  the  observed  relations."  He 
estimated  a  total  horizontal  separation  of  about  1067 
m  (3500  feet)  of  the  base  of  the  Towsley/Pico  For- 
mation along  the  Kagel  fault. 

If  the  features  resulting  from  movements  along 
the  Kagel  fault  during  the  earthquake  are  indicative 
of  previous  faulting,  the  earthquake  provided  support 
for  the  position  that  the  Kagel  fault  has  both  normal 
and  left-lateral  components  of  movement.  Most  of 
the  scarps  formed  during  the  earthquake  are  up  on 
the  north.  The  greatest  vertical  offset  was  85  cm 
(2.8  feet)  (102).  Most  of  these  scarps  are  vertical 
and  probablv  do  not  reflect  the  true  dip  of  the  fault. 
That  the  fault  is  south  dipping  is  indicated  by  the 
slightly  irregular  trace  where  it  crosses  topoeraphy, 
as  shown  on  the  geologic  map.  Just  east  of  the  bottom 
of  Bartholomaus  Canyon  (107),  the  actual  fault  plane 
was  exposed  as  a  result  of  the  earthquake.  The  Kagel 
fault  dips  46°  S.  and  here  separates  sheared  and  frac- 
tured conglomerate  of  the  Towsley/Pico  Formation 
from  gray  gypsiferous,  highly  contorted  shale  and 
siltstone  of  the  Modelo  Formation.  Movement  here 
was  up  on  the  south  rather  than  down  as  is  much 
more  common  for  the  Kagel  fault  surface  breaks. 
However,  60  m  (200  feet)  upslope  (eastward)  and 
also  at  the  top  of  the  ridge,  scarps  developed  which 
are  down  on  the  south.  The  explanation  for  this 
change  in  the  facine  direction  of  the  scarps  mav  lie 
in  a  consideration  of  the  lateral  component  of  fault- 
ing. In  the  bottom  of  Kagel  Canvon.  the  total  offset 


on  the  Kaccl  fault  was  25  cm  (10  inches)  left  lateral 
as  measured  in  the  road. 

The  surface  breaks  map  (plate  3)  shows  that  the 
highest  scarps  formed  at  the  tops  of  ridges  (102)  and 
on  west-facing  slopes.  Curiously,  east-facing  slopes 
(Bartholomaus  Canyon  and  Kagel  Canvon,  for  exam- 
ple) lack  even  minor  evidence  of  surface  breakage. 
The  western  side  of  Kagel  Canyon  is  also  the  site  of 
large  landslides  in  the  Modelo  shale  and  siltstone, 
which  moved,  in  part,  during  the  earthquake,  de- 
stroying several  houses. 

Spatially  related  to  movements  along  the  Kagel 
fault  are  surface  cff^ects  not  on  the  trace  of  the  fault 
but  probably  related  to  movements  at  depth  along  it. 
Such  a  feature  is  a  large,  reactivated  landslide  on  the 
east  side  of  Bartholomaus  Canyon  (photo  8).  As  the 
geologic  map  shows,  this  landslide  is  one  of  three 
slides  on  the  east  side  of  Bartholomaus  Canvon  that 
was  reactivated  by  the  earthquake.  A  large  slide  on 
the  west  side  of  the  canyon  did  not  move  during  the 
earthquake.  The  relation  of  the  slides  to  the  folds  in 
the  Modelo  Formation  suggests  that  perhaps  minor 
movements  on  these  folds  may  have  occurred.  Sur- 
face effects  in  Kagel  Canyon  may  also  be  related  to 
this  phenomenon. 

Currently  available  exposures  of  the  Kagel  fault 
indicate  that  it  dies  out  in  the  bedding  of  a  soft  gray 
silty  sandstone  unit  of  the  Towsley/Pico  Formation 
about  457  m  (1500  feet)  east  of  Dexter  Park.  Further- 
more, the  lack  of  deformation  in  the  sedimentary 
layers  east  of  there,  similar  to  that  encountered  in 
Kagel  Canyon,  supports  the  concept  of  diminishing 
movement  on  the  Kagel  fault  and  dispersal  into  bed- 
ding-planes. The  development  of  excellent  scarps 
(photo  9)  at  localities  115,  114  is  somewhat  puz- 
zling because  these  scarps  do  not  appear  to  coincide 
with  the  trace  of  the  Kagel  fault.  At  one  localit&gt;' 
(115),  the  scarp  is  about  90  m  (300  feet)  north  of 
the  Kagel  fault,  which  is  exposed  in  a  roadcut  on  this 
ridge.  This  particular  scarp  formed  very  close  to  the 
topographically  highest  point  on  this  ridge  and  paral- 
lels the  strike  of  the  bedding  in  the  Towsley/Pico 
sediments  but  dips  70°  to  80°  S.,  whereas  the  beds 
dip  50°  N.  This  particular  scarp  may  represent  a 
new  fault  formed  near  the  end  of  the  Kagel  fault  in 
response  to  the  movements  during  this  earthquake. 
East  of  this  locality  (114),  the  north-facing  scarp, 
which  also  is  situated  at  the  very  top  of  a  small  peak, 
may  have  resulted  from  focusing  of  shaking  energy 
attested  to  by  the  shattered  ground  hereabouts  and 
the  rockfalls  and  slope  failures  in  this  vicinit&gt;'  and 
may  not  actually  be  a  "fault"  scarp.  This  intense 
shaking  also  appears  to  have  caused  the  heavy  damage 
to  new  U.S.  Forest  Service  facilities  in  lower  .Marek 
Can\on.  No  evidence  was  found  that  \\'ould  indicate 
that  the  Kagel  fault  extends  that  far  east.  The  surface 
cracks  in  the  roads  of  the  facility'  all  appear  to  be 
related  to  the  compaction  of  fills  at  the  contact  with 
cuts  or  edge  breakage  due  to  bank  failures  in  the  ter- 
race material  thereabouts. 

Along  the  western  end  of  the  Kagel  fault,  scarps 
similar  to  the  one  at  locality  115  formed  north  of  the 
actual  fault  trace.  These  scarps  also  had  the  largest

Surface  Effects  Other  Than  Faulting 

Lividslidcs.  Various  kinds  of  earthquake  effects  in 
addition  to  surface  faulting  arc  widespread  and  abun- 
dant in  the  area  north  of  the  Tujunga  segment  (plate 
}).  Perhaps  the  most  widespread  surface  features  are 
the  slope  failures  triggered  b\-  the  earthquake  or,  in 
some  cases,  b\-  aftershocks.  .Mthough  Morton  dis- 
cusses these  effects  elsewhere  in  this  Bulletin,  it  is  ap- 
propriate to  mention  them  here  to  emphasize  their 
obvious  or  apparent  relation  to  the  underlying  geol- 
ogy- 


A  comparison  of  the  surface  breaks  map  (plate  3) . 
with  the  geologic  map  (plate  2)  demonstrates  the 
lithologic  control  over  the  formation  of  landslides  as 
Morton  has  pointed  out  (1971a;  1971b;  this  Bulletin). 
In  the  area  north  of  the  Tujunga  segment  and  south 
of  the  basement  rocks,  most  larger  landslides  occurred 
in  rocks  of  the  Modelo  Formation  and  Towsley/Pico 
Formations  with  relatively  few  forming  in  the  region 
underlain  by  the  Saugus  Formation.  Within  the  Sau- 
gus  Formation,  many"  of  the  larger  slides  are  failures 
of  the  steep  banks  of  terrace  or  fan  deposits  resting  on 
tilted  Saugus  beds  and  not  failures  of  the  Saugus  rocks 
themselves.  Conversely,  minor  soil  failures,  cracking, 
and  falling  away  of  the  sharp  edges  of  ridges  under- 
lain bv  Saugus  rocks  appear  to  be  more  common  than 
in  the  areas  underlain  by  the  older  Tertiary  rocks. 
The  varied  lithology,  as'  well  as  the  steeper  topog- 
raphy developed  on  it,  helps  to  explain  the  abundancp 
of^  slope  failures  in  the  terrain  underlain  by  the  older

Tertiary  sediments  (photo  10).  An  additional  cause 
may  be  the  proximity  of  these  units  to  the  zone  of 
surface  faulting  and  the  probable  greater  ground  mo- 
tion to  which  they  \\ere  subjected. 

The  reactivation  of  large  landslides  in  Bartholo- 
maus  Canyon  (photo  8)  has  already  been  mentioned 
under  the  discussion  of  the  Kagel  fault.  A  causal  re- 
lationship to  movements  on  the  Kagel  fault  ^\•as  in- 
ferred there.  The  large  rockfalls  directly  along  the 
Kagel  fault  resulted,  not  only  because  of  severe 
ground  movements,  but  because  faulting  in  the  past 
has  juxtaposed  resistant,  coarse  conglomerate  against 
weak  siltstone  and  shale  and  cliffs  naturally  formed 
along  their  contact. 

As  the  surface  effects  map  (plate  3)  shows,  nu- 
merous large  rockfalls  formed  in  the  vicinitv'  of  Pa- 
coima Dam  and  in  the  rugged  gorge  of  Pacoima 
Canyon.  One  of  the  largest  of  these  rockfalls  (photo 
11)  did  not  form  during  the  major  shock  but  fell  sev- 
eral hours  later  as  is  proved  by  its  absence  in  photo 
12.  This  is  an  illustration  of  a  geologic  hazard  created 
directly  by  an  earthquake.  It  remains  an  unknown 
threat  of  danger  not  yet  past  until  recognized  or,  of 
course,  until  it  falls. 

Several  very  large  landslides  of  unknown  age  are 
shown  on  the  geologic  map  in  the  area  underlain  by 
basement  rocks.  Only  one  of  these  slides  (upper  Kagel 
Canyon  above  the  trace  of  the  Lopez  fault)  was  par- 
tially "reactivated"  by  the  earthquake  in  the  same 
manner  that  landslides  in  the  sedimentary  rocks  to  the 
south  were.  The  large  composite  slides  that  conceal  the 
trace  of  the  Little  Tujunga  fault  in  upper  .Marek  Can- 
yon exhibited  a  distinctive  kind  of  response  to  the 
earthquake.  These  slides  contain  large  blocks  of 
granodiorite  and  other  basement  rock  types  ranging 
up  to  tens  of  feet  on  a  side.  Because  the  slide  did  not 
move  as  a  bod\'  during  the  earthquake,  it  is  assumed 
that  the  earthquake  waves  moved  through  the  slide 
rather  than  affecting  it  as  a  unit  relative  to  the  bed- 
rock beneath  it.  Large,  prcvioush-  fractured  blocks 
within  the  slides,  however,  became  disjointed  and 
some  of  them  cracked  and  fell  apart. 

Small  landslides  and  debris  falls  formed  in  Maple 
Canyon  along  the  toe  of  a  huge  landslide  north  of 
Kagel  Mountain,  but  there  is  no  evidence  that  this 
slide  moved  downslopc  as  a  unit.  The  scarps  that 
formed  along  the  top  of  Kagel  Mountain  (49)  can  be 
followed  discontinuousl\-  for  thousands  of  feet  (plate 
3).  They  appear  to  offset  bedrock,  locally,  and  are 
down  on  the  upslope  side  in  certain  places.  They  may 
be  related  in  some  way  to  movement  of  what  may  be 
a  large  landslide  on  the  north  slope  of  Kagel  .Moun- 
tain. 

Settlaijent  of  fill.  Differential  settling  or  com- 
paction of  artificial  fill  due  to  shaking  resulted  in  the 
formation  of  surface  cracks  and  non-rcctonic  scarps 
at  the  contact  of  the  fill  with  natural  ground.  This 
phenomenon  was  locally  responsible  for  considerable 
damage.  particularl\-  to  roads  and  other  paved  areas. 
Cracking  around  the  boundaries  of  a  large  sanitary 
landfill  (plate  3)  on  the  hilltop  west  of  the  mouth  of 
Lopez  Canyon  is  a  prime  example  of  surface  breakage 
of  this  t\-pe.  Settling  of  fills  in  the  vicinity  of  Camp

Shattered  ridge  tops.  Another  distinctive  cate- 
gor\'  of  non-faulting  surface  effects  is  the  remarkable 
and,  locally,  spectacular  development  of  shattered 
ridge  tops.  The  distribution  of  these  features  is  plotted 
in  plate  ?.  In  general,  this  effect  is  expressed  as  cha- 
otic disruption  of  soil  where  it  is  commonly  less  than 
60  cm  (2  feet)  thick  along  ridge  crests  and  peaks 
underlain  by  sandstone  and  conglomerate  strata.  The 
shattering  ma\'  be  localizxd  along  certain  strata  (99, 
110,  ll.V,  photos  7  and  13),  or  it  may  be  concentrated 
where  there  is  especially  angular  topography  (109, 
112).  .\n  example  of  the  association  with  particular 
layers  is  shown  in  photo  13  (110).  In  this  case,  a 
sandy  cobble  conglomerate  layer  of  the  Saugus  For- 
mation exhibited  shattering  at  ridge  tops  for  550  m 
(1800  feet)  along  the  strike  of  the  bedding.  The  in- 
duration and  lithology  of  tiiis  bed  is  not  noticeably 
different  from  that  of  undisturbed  beds  above  and  be- 
low it  in  the  Saugus  Formation.  An  explanation  for 
localization  here  is  suggested  by  the  presence  of  minor 
surface  faults  which  bracket  the  bed  at  the  eastern 


end  of  the  shattered  portion  and  beyond  the  western 
end  (plate  3).  The  shattering  of  the  soil  along  this 
layer  may  represent  a  dispersal  at  the  surface  of  en- 
ergy that  was  concentrated  here  alone  bedding  planes. 
In  addition,  the  rocks  are  not  as  well  lithified  here  as 
they  are  where  bedding-plane  faults  did  develop  (98, 
for  example).

Shattering  was  well  developed  in  areas  of  badland 
topography  (109)  and  in  areas  characterized  b\'  the 
presence  of  numerous  sharp  peaks  and  ridge  crests 
that  are  typical  of  terrain  underlain  by  the  Saugus 
Formation  (112).  Within  areas  subjected  to  the  same 
intensity  of  shaking,  only  the  tops  of  narrow  ridges 
were  shattered.  This  suggests  that  the  cohesiveness  of 
the  soil  \\'as  overcome  at  these  localities  by  magnifica- 
tion of  the  energy  relative  to  the  surface  area  due  to 
the  focusing  effect  of  converging  planes  or  surfaces. 
Less  well-indurated  materials  lying  on  more  consoli- 
dated rocks  also  were  shattered  in  less  angular  but 
topographically  high  places  (photo  14).  The  shatter- 
ing of  terrace  deposits  on  Sugarloaf  (108)  is  an  ex- 
ample of  this  type.

An  additional  observation  concerning  the  locali- 
zation and  lithologic  control  of  shattered  ridge  tops 
can  be  made  by  comparing  plates  2  and  3.  Of  special 
interest  is  the  restriction  of  shattered  ridge  tops  to 
rocks  of  the  Towsley/Pico  Formation  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  contact  with  the  overlying  Saugus  Formation. 
This  particular  feature  is  best  seen  east  and  west  of 
Kagel  Canyon.  The  localization  of  shattered  ridges  in 
rocks  near  this  contact  is  noteworthy  here.  Strong 
ground  effects,  of  which  shattered  ridges  are  an  indi- 
cation, were  also  demonstrated  by  the  damage  to  Los 
Angeles  County  Fire  Station  No.  74  in  the  Dexter 
Park  area  of  Kagel  Canyon. 

The  evidence  for  unusually  high  acceleration  in 
the  vicinit\'  of  the  fire  station  was  discussed  by  Mor- 
rill (1971),  who  also  presented  several  pictures  of  the 
exceptionally  strong  effects.  In  this  vicinity,  bedding- 
plane  faults  in  the  Towsley/Pico  rocks  with  left- 
lateral  displacement  of  5-10  cm  (2^  inches)  were 
common  across  Kagel  Canvon  Road  (plate  3).  Water 
tanks  on  the  ridge  east  of  Dexter  Park  were  moved 
and  connections  to  pipes  broken.  Water  tanks  west  of 
Kagel    Canyon    also    moved    ofT    their    foundations, 


buckling  the  steel  plates  near  their  bases  and  breaking 
the  connections  with  pipes.  Within  Dexter  Park  it- 
self, the  road  and  the  stone  ■wall  along  the  east  side 
of  the  park  \\as  cracked  almost  exactly  at  the  contact 
of  the  Towsley  'Pico  and  Saugus  Formations  and  not 
noticeably  affected  elsewhere.  Cracking  of  the  road 
entering  the  park  on  the  west  side  past  the  Count&gt;-  fire 
station  was  restricted  to  that  portion  overlving  Tows- 
ley/Pico rocks.  Minor  damage  to  this  road  developed 
onl\-  localK'  over  Saugus  rocks.  Farther  to  the  cast 
along  the  contact,  strong  shattering,  abundant  rock- 
falls,  and  damage  to  man-made  structures  such  as  the 
U.S.  Forest  Service  facility  in  Marek  Canyon  were 
concentrated  along  but  not  restricted  to  rocks  of  the 
Towsley/Pico  Formation  as  they  were  in  Kagel  Can- 
\'on.  As  suggested  under  the  discussion  of  the  Kagel 
fault,  very  strong  shaking  within  the  Saugus  Forma- 
tion at  the  Forest  Service  facility  ma\'  have  been  re- 
lated in  some  way  to  the  amplification  of  ground 
movement  bevond  the  end  of  surface  faulting  along 
the  Kagel  fault. 

The  abundant  surface  effects  and  damage  result- 
ing from  higher  acceleration  along  the  contact  be- 
tween the  Saugus  and  underlying  rocks  must  be  re- 
lated to  the  differences  in  the  underlying  geology. 
The  better  cemented,  better  sorted  Towsley/Pico 
rocks  evidently  responded  differenth-  to  the  passage 
of  earthquake  energy  than  the  Saugus  rocks,  which 
are  less  well  consolidated  and  lithologically  more 
varied.  Perhaps  the  Saugus  sediments  are  capable  of 
dispersing  energy  better.  What  took  place  along  the 
contact  during  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  implies 
that  the  gross  lithological  differences,  as  well  as  the 
physical  properties  of  the  rocks  themselves,  should 
certainly  be  taken  into  account  when  studies  are  made 
of  sites  for  critical  facilities. 

Post-earthquake  surveying  data  provided  addi- 
tional support  for  the  correlation  of  earthquake  ef- 
fects and  the  contact  between  the  Towsley/Pico  and 
Saugus  Formations.  In  their  preliminary  survey.  Bur- 
ford  and  others  (1971,  p.  81)  reported  that  the  largest 
vertical  displacements  they  documented  were  on  the 
loop  through  Kagel  and  Lopez  Canyons.  The  largest 
change  in  elevation,  2.281  m  (7.48  feet)  (Burford 
and  others,  1971,  figure  1),  lies  almost  precisely  on 
the  formational  contact  in  Lopez  Canyon.  Further 
data  support  the  preliminary  observations.  Savage 
(1971,  figure  5)  presented  a  map  in  \\hich  the  great- 
est changes  in  elevation  (at  least  2  m)  were  contained 
within  an  elongated  closed  contour  bounding  the  area 
of  permanent  uplift  that  extends  from  Little  Tujunga 
to  Pacoima  Canyon.  The  axis  of  this  area  of  highest 
permanent  deformation  coincides  very  closely  with 
the  formational  contact  discussed  above.  West  of  Pa- 
coima Canyon,  the  trend  of  the  greatest  elevation 
changes  also  appears  to  correspond  closely  with  the 
contact  (see  discussion  of  this  area  by  Weber,  this 
Bulletin). 

The  concentration  of  effects  and  magnitude  of 
permanent  surface  deformation  at  the  formational 
contact  may  be  related  to  the  gross  geologic  struc- 
ture, as  well  as  to  the  difference  in  lithology  between 
the  rocks.  Savage  (1971,  p.  112)  has  suggested  that 
the  earthquake  "faulting  appears  to  be  in  response  to

a  north-south  compressive  force  whicli  acts  upon  the 
whole  region."  No  doubt  forces  of  similar  orientation 
in  the  past  were  responsible  for  tlic  development  of 
the  very  large  overturned  fold  that  is  tiie  Merrick 
svnclinc  as  well  as  the  north-dipping  thrust  faults.  It 
is  cxtreniel\-  difficult  to  prove  that  actual  folding  did 
occur  in  this  structure  during  the  earthquake.  .Minor 
surface  effects  in  the  center  of  the  .^Ierrick  syncline 
were  locallv  strong  (for  example,  in  Limekiln  Canyon 
and  near  Little  Tujunga  Canyon).  Weber  (this  Bulle- 
tin) discusses  circumstantial  evidence  suggesting  fold- 
ing(?)  in  the  Juvenile  Hall  area. 

PACOIMA  CANYON  TO  WILSON  CANYON 

With  the  exception  of  surface  faulting  on  the 
Veterans  fault,  numerous  slope  failures,  and,  locally, 
shattered  ridges — the  effects  of  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  on  the  surficial  geology  of  this  area  are 
rather  slight  compared  to  the  damage  to  man-made 
structures.  Because  there  will  continue  to  be  ques- 
tions as  to  \\h&gt;-  this  area  experienced  such  severe 
ground  motion  without  producing  major  geological 
surface  effects,  an  account  of  the  geologic  framework 
is  given  below.  This  is  followed  b\-  a  discussion  of 
effects  which  were  produced.  The  geolog\'  was 
mapped  on  post-earthquake  aerial  photos  at  a  scale  of 
1  inch  equals  200  feet  (1:2400).  Almost  every  ridge 
top  and  stream  bottom  was  traversed  as  were  all  the 
roads  in  the  area. 

Geologic  Framework 

The  geology  along  the  front  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  in  this  vicinity  consists  of  the  pre-Ter- 
tiary  granitic  and  metamorphic  rocks  of  the  basement 
complex  with  Pleistocene  and  younger  terrestrial  sedi- 
mentary rocks  either  deposited  upon  or  faulted 
against' them  (plate  2).  This  discussion  concerns  the 
geologv  of  the  foothill  belt  which  is  450  to  900  m 
(1500  to  3000  feet)  wide  and  lies  between  the  allu- 
vial cover  of  the  northeastern  Sylmar  plain  on  the 
south  and  the  basement  complex  on  the  north.  Within 
this  narrow  belt,  rocks  of  the  lower  Pleistocene  por- 
tion of  the  Saugus  Formation,  middle  Pleistocene  Pa- 
coima  Formation,  upper  Pleistocene  terrace  and  allu- 
vial fan  deposits,  and  Holocene  alluvium  arc  exposed. 

Structurally,  folding  is  the  dominant  feature  but 
faulting  is  locally  significant.  A  detailed  discussion  of 
the  geolog\-  of  the  Saugus  and  Pacoima  Formations 
is  given  below,  so  that  an  assessment  of  the  signifi- 
cance of  the  faulting  can  be  made. 

Exposures  of  Saugus  Formation  are  limited  to 
small  areas  east  of  the  \'eterans  Administration  Hospi- 
tal site  and  near  the  mouth  of  .May  Canyon.  Oakeshott 
(1958,  p.  84)  has  ably  summarized  the  lithology  of  the 
Saugus  Formation  which  consists  of  "light-colored, 
poorly  sorted,  looseh"  consolidated  conglomerate  and 
coarse  sandstone,  commonly  crossbedded,  which  were 
deposited  as  fluvatile  and  alluvial-fan  sediments  around 
the  western  end  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains."  Sau- 
gus conglomerate  in  this  area  contains  numerous  boul- 
ders and  cobbles  of  anorthosite  and  related  rocks,  as 
well  as  the  more  abundant  granitic  rock  types.  Saugus 
beds  dip  uniformly  to  the  northeast  or  northwest  and 
presumably  form  a  continuous  section  of  northward- 


dipping  rocks,  concealed  by  alluvium,  extending  be- 
neath the  Svlmar  plain  from  the  foothill  belt  south- 
ward, approximately  3.2  km  (2  miles),  to  the  contact 
with  the  Tow slc\7 Pico  Formation  (plate  2). 

The  middle  Pleistocene  Pacoima  Formation  was 
named  by  Oakeshott  (1952),  who  designated  as  the 
type  locality  exposures  near  the  mouth  of  Pacoima 
Canyon  about  a  half  mile  south  of  Pacoima  Dam. 
Oakeshott  (1958,  p.  86)  described  the  Pacoima  Forma- 
tion as  a  fanglomerate  or  sedimentary  breccia  which 
"is  ver\-  poorly  sorted,  consisting  of  sharply  angular 
pebbles  and  boulders  of  a  wide  size  range  all  deposited 
together  with  a  dark  brown  or  reddish-brown  mud- 
stone-soil  matrix."  All  the  clasts  in  the  Pacoima  are  lo- 
cally derived,  except,  of  course,  those  that  arc  re- 
worked from  the  Towsley  Formation  west  of  Wilson 
Canyon.  Rock  types  can  be  recognized  in  the  deposits 
that  are  identical  to  those  cropping  out  just  upslope  in 
the  basement  complex. 

The  Pacoima  Formation  is  readily  distinguished 
from  the  Saugus  Formation  because  it  has  much  poorer 
bedding,  poorer  sorting,  and  much  more  angular  clasts 
of  local  derivation;  it  lacks  the  distinctive  anorthosite 
and  other  distanth-  derived  rocks  found  in  the  Saugus; 
and  it  is  commonlx"  dark  brown  or  red  in  contrast  to 
the  light  gra\-  or  white  of  the  Saugus  sediments.  The 
contact  between  the  Saugus  and  Pacoima  Formations 
is  exposed  in  lower  Loop  Canyon,  where  there  is  a 
20°  to  40°  depositional  angular  discordance,  east  of 
the  mouth  of  Alay  Canyon  where  the  formations  are 
almost  conformable,  and  west  of  .May  Canyon,  where 
there  is  10°  to  20°  of  discordance. 

The  contact  berween  the  Pacoima  Formation  and 
the  basement  rock  is  a  variable  one.  Northeast  of  the 
Veterans  Administration  Hospital,  the  basement  rocks 
have  been  thrust  over  the  Pacoima.  Just  east  of  Loop 
Can\on,  the  Pacoima  is  in  depositional  contact  on  the 
basement.  West  of  Loop  Canyon,  the  contact  is  a 
.south-dipping  normal  fault  that  can  be  traced  as  far 
as  the  canyon  north  of  the  .May  Canyon  debris  dam. 
The  remainder  of  the  contact  to  the  west  is  a  deposi- 
tional one. 

These  conclusions  are  in  contrast  to  those  of 
Oakeshott  (1958),  who  showed  the  contact  east  of 
Loop  Can\on  between  Pacoima  and  basement  rocks  to 
be  a  depositional  one.  Between  Loop  Can&gt;"on  and 
Wilson  Canyon,  Oakeshott  (1958,  p.  86)  stated  that 
"the  basement  crystalline  rocks  have  been  thrust 
southward  over  the  Pacoima  Formation  at  angles  vary- 
ing from  45°  to  60°,  cutting  out  the  north  limb  of  the 
Little  Tujunga  [.Merrick]  syncline."  The  "thrust"  to 
which  Oakeshott  referred  was  defined  by  him  (1958, 
p.  93)  as  the  Hospital  fault.  He  considered  the  type 
locality  of  the  fault  to  be  0.5  km  (0.3  mile)  north  of 
the  Veterans  Administration  Hospital  evidently  in  an 
exposure  on  the  .Mav  Canyon  truck  trail  on  the  west 
side  of  Loop  Can\on  where  he  showed  it  dipping  60° 

Although  Merifield  (1958)  depicted  a  "Hospital 
fault"  on  his  map,  he  showed  it  differenth'  from  Oake- 
shott. Merifield  (1958,  p.  37)  said  that  "a  dip  of  60° 
north  was  obtained  on  the  [Hospital]  fault  in  an  ex- 
posure on  the  ridge  ca.st  of  Loop  Canyon;  furthermore, 
the  straight  character  of  the  fault  [across  the  topog-

raphy]  suggests  the  dip  is  nowhere  much  less  than  this 
figure."  Alerifield  differed  in  locating  this  "fault",  as 
well  as  in  its  attitude.  His  map  shows  it  trending 
northwest  away  from  the  Pacoima-basemcnt  contact 
about  halfway  between  May  and  Wilson  Canyons. 

The  detailed  mapping  during  the  present  study, 
some  excellent  new  exposures,  and  an  emphasis  on  the 
geology  specifically  along  this  contact  have  resulted 
in  a  geologic  map  considerably  different  from  that  of 
earlier  \\-orkers.  The  particular  evidence  available  from 
east  to  west  along  this  contact  is  discussed  below  in 
detail  so  that  the  factors  can  be  assessed  from  which 
the  present  conclusions  were  dra\\'n.  Finally,  impli- 
cations of  these  conclusions  with  respect  to  the  earth- 
quake are  discussed. 

Between  Pacoima  Canyon  and  Loop  Canyon,  ex- 
ploration pits  and  bulldozed  roads  have  made  new 
exposures  on  the  lower  slopes  along  the  mountain 
front.  One  of  these  roads  exposes  the  thrust-faulted 
contact  between  slightly  foliated  granodiorite  on  the 
north  and  Pacoima  Formation  on  the  south.  The  dip 
of  the  fault  is  20°  to  the  north  and  the  Pacoima  For- 
mation dips  32°  N.  directly  beneath  the  fault.  A 
few  feet  west  of  this  roadcut,  there  is  a  natural  expos- 
ure of  granodioritic  rocks  overlying  reddish  Pacoima 
Formation  in  a  steep--v\-alled  gully.  The  mapped  fault 
trace  closely  follows  the  contours,  confirming  the 
shallowness  of  dip  as  measured  in  the  roadcut.  Aloving 
westward  to  the  ridge  just  east  of  Loop  Canyon,  the 
contact  bet^\een  Pacoima  and  basement  rocks  dips 
moderately  toward  the  south  as  is  shown  by  the  inter- 
section of  the  contact  with  the  topography.  Further- 
more, this  contact  is  a  depositional  one  as  is  reflected 
in  the  similarity  between  the  dip  of  the  contact  and  the 
dip  of  the  bedding  in  the  Pacoima  Formation.  The 
map  shows  that  the  Pacoima  beds  arc  folded  into  a 
gentle  syncline.  The  beds  near  the  basement  dip  away 
from  the  contact  rather  than  to\\ard  it  as  is  the  case  to 
the  east,  discussed  above,  where  the  basement  is  thrust 
over  the  sediments. 

An  analogy  can  be  drawn  to  the  thrust  fault  east 
of  Pacoima  Canyon  where  basement  rocks  overlie 
Saugus  Formation.  It  is  common  along  the  Lopez 
fault  and  the  Little  Tujunga  fault  for  the  Saugus  beds 
to  dip  at  rather  gentle  angles  toward  the  overriding 
fault  (plate  2).  It  is  so  common,  in  fact,  that,  in  the 
absence  of  an  exposure  of  the  actual  fault  contact,  to 
have  the  bedding  dip  gcntU'  to^\•ard  the  basement 
rocks  ma_\'  be  taken  as  a  valid  criterion  to  infer  the 
presence  of  such  an  overthrust  fault.  As  suggested  on 
the  geologic  map  (plate  2),  the  thrust  faulting  between 
basement  and  sediments  east  of  Loop  Canyon  may  be 
the  western  end  of  movements  along  the  Buck  Canyon 
fault.  The  geometry  of  the  northward-dipping  thrust 
faults,  most  likely  related  to  deformation  associated 
with  the  San  Gabriel  fault  and  diminished  offsets  at 
their  southwestern  ends,  provides  additional  support 
for  considering  the  faulting  west  of  Pacoima  Canyon 
to  be  analogous  to  that  to  the  east. 

It  is  now  appropriate  to  look  at  the  exposures  of 
the  contact  in  Loop  Canyon  that  Oakeshott  (1958) 
defined  as  the  type  locality  for  the  "Hospital  fault." 
The  large  roadcuts  along  the  May  Canyon  truck  trail 
provide  practically  continuous  exposures  of  the  geol- 


ogy north  of  the  Veterans  Administration  Hospital. 
Even  though  the  Pacoima  Formation  is  a  very  coarse 
sedimentary  breccia  at  this  locality,  the  excellent  ex- 
posures made  it  possible  to  determine  the  attitude  of 
rude  bedding  in  the  formation.  The  continuation  of 
the  s\ncline  visible  east  of  Loop  Canyon  was  easily 
mapped  along  the  road. 

Near  the  contact  with  the  basement  rocks,  the 
coarse  Pacoima  debris  dips  60°  to  70°  S.  and  is  sep- 
arated from  the  granodiorite  by  a  thin  sequence  of 
medium-grained,  sandy  sedimentary  breccia  beds  in- 
terlayered  with  beds  of  coarser  debris.  Oakeshott 
(1958,  photo  66)  interpreted  this  finer  grained  deposit 
to  be  Saugus  Formation  and  concluded  that  the  Pa- 
coima sits  unconformably  on  it  here;  however,  as  can 
be  seen  in  his  photo,  there  are  coarser  beds  inter- 
layered  with  the  finer  debris.  These  coarser  beds  are 
lithologically  identical  to  the  thicker  Pacoima  beds  a 
few  feet  higher  in  the  section.  Furthermore,  the  ma- 
terial composing  the  finer  light-colored  sedimentary 
breccia  is  very  angular  and,  in  hand  specimen,  appears 
to  be  lithologically  identical  to  the  granodiorite  di- 
rectly in  contact  with  it.  There  has  been  faulting  at 
this  locality,  and  a  zone  of  gouge  and  /or  caliche  about 
3  cm  (1  inch)  thick  that  dips  82°  S.  separates  the  base- 
ment rock  from  the  sediments.  This  contact  can  be 
followed  westward  over  a  low  ridge  to  the  western 
slope,  where  it  is  also  exposed  and  dips  60°  south.  No 
reverse  faulting  was  observed  between  the  basement 
and  the  Pacoima  Formation,  although  there  are  sev- 
eral faults  with  various  attitudes  within  the  fractured 
basement  rocks.  The  dip  of  the  Pacoima  beds  is  away 
from  the  basement,  and  the  material  closest  to  the  con- 
tact appears  to  be  very  locally  derived.  This  suggests 
that  perhaps  the  Pacoima  has  been  folded  as  the 
frontal  portion  of  the  mountains  rose  and  tilted 
toward  the  south,  rather  than  being  thrust  over  the 
sediments. 

Cropping  out  about  30  m  (100  feet)  north  of  the 
contact  along  the  truck  trail  are  extremely  sheared,  no 
longer  identifiable  basement  rocks  no\\-  expressed  as  a 
zone  of  gritty,  greenish  gouge  containing  \\hat  ap- 
pear to  be  crushed  white  and  pink  remnants  of 
granitic  dikes.  A  special  symbol  is  used  on  the  geo- 
logic map  to  indicate  that  the  attitude  of  shear  planes 
in  these  outcrops  is  variable.  The  dip,  however,  is 
uniformly  to  the  west,  ranging  from  10°  to  50°.  This 
highly  sheared  zone  continues  northward  along  the 
road  and  is  ^\'ell  exposed  east  of  the  road  on  a  small 
ridge  that  extends  into  the  canyon.  Material  of  this 
kind  was  not  found  on  the  east  wall  of  Loop  Canyon, 
nor  could  it  be  traced  very  far  to  the  west.  It  is 
suggested  that  this  shear  zone  represents  ancient  tec- 
tonic movements.  The  present  outcrop  pattern  sug- 
gests that  this  zone  is  a  "fossil"  fault  zone  and  is 
probably  unrelated  to  the  more  recent  diastrophism 
involving  the  rise  of  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains  during 
Pleistocene  time. 

The  straightness  of  the  contact  across  rugged 
topography  east  of  the  canyon  north  of  the  .May  Can- 
yon debris  dam,  also  observed  by  Merifield  (1958), 
implies  a  ver\'  steep  boundar\-  between  the  basement 
and  Pacoima  rocks.  The  chaotic  nature  of  the  Pacoima 
Formation  makes  it  difficult  and,  locally,  impossible  to

determine  the  nttinidc  of  the  unit.  In  the  lower  por- 
tion of  the  formation,  west  of  the  syncline  near  Loop 
Canyon,  the  bedding  is  better  developed  and  dips 
moderately  and  consistently  toward  the  basement. 
However,  the  dips  obtained  closest  to  the  contact 
range  from  70'  to  90°  north.  Where  exposed,  the 
contact  has  all  the  appearances  of  being  a  depositional 
one  with  the  sediments  resting  on  granodioritc  and 
foliated  dioritic  rocks.  Nevertheless,  as  the  sparse  atti- 
tudes and  geometry  of  the  trace  indicate,  the  contact 
must  be  a  steep  to  vertical  fault  from  Loop  Canyon 
to  the  north-trending  canyon  behind  May  Canyon 
debris  dam  (plate  2). 

From  this  canyon  west  to  Wilson  Canyon,  the 
Pacoima  Formation  is  in  depositional  contact  on  a  va- 
riety of  basement  rock  types.  A  continuation  of  the 
gentle  frontal  syncline  reappears;  and  the  trace  of  the 
contact  is  irregular  on  the  map,  reflecting  the  low  to 
moderate  dips"  of  the  Pacoima  rocks.  The  Pacoima 
Formation  in  this  vicinity  is  covered  locally  by  the 
remnants  of  a  dark  red  deposit  of  alluvial  fan  debris 
that  has  been  dissected  and  partialh-  eroded  away. 
This  alluvial  fan  deposit  is  very  similar  in  appearance 
to  the  Pacoima  Formation  and  no  doubt  formed  un- 
der similar  conditions;  however,  the  fan  rests  uncon- 
formably  on  the  synclinally  folded  Pacoima  beds  and 
is,  therefore,  younger  than  the  Pacoima  Formation. 

Conjectural  Fault  East  of  Olive  View 

Intensive  mapping  of  the  geology  along  the 
mountain  front  has  revealed  that  the  contact  between 
the  basement  rocks  and  the  Pacoima  Formation,  de- 
scribed by  Oakeshott  (1958)  as  the  Hospital  fault, 
changes  from  a  steep  south-dipping  to  vertical  norrnal 
fault'to  depositional.  Present  exposures  do  not  provide 
any  evidence  for  a  north-dipping  thrust  fault  of  the 
Sierra  .Madre  s\stem  between  Loop  Canyon  and  Olive 
\' iew.  This  observation  leads  to  the  question,  if  such  a 
structural  relation  exists  between  the  basement  rocks 
and  the  vounger  sedimentary  rocks  along  this  portion 
of  the  San  Gabriel  Range  as  it  characteristically  does 
elsewhere  east  and  west  of  here,  just  where  could  it 
be?  ... 

The  coniectural  fault  cast  of  Olive  View  as 
shown  on  the  geologic  map  (plate  2)  is  based  upon  a 
variety  of  circumstantial  evidence.  This  evidence  does 
no  more  than  suggest  the  presence  of  conditions 
which  can  be  ascribed  to  faulting.  The  coniectural 
fault  is  also  based  upon  the  present  high  elevation  of 
the  basement  rocks  and  folding  in  the  nearby  sedi- 
ments which  may  imply  such  a  structure.  The  evi- 
dence is  sufficient  only  for  speculation  on  such  a  fault. 
To  prove  or  disprove  the  existence  of  this  hypotheti- 
cal fault,  it  would  be  necessary  to  employ  geophysical 
and  other  methods  to  investigate  the  hidden  geology 
in  this  vicinity. 

Nevertheless,  the  circumstantial  evidence  for  this 
conjectural  fault  is  abundant  and  consists  of  several 
different  kinds  of  features.  Between  Olive  ^'iew  and 
the  canyon  north  of  .Ma\-  Can\'on  debris  dam,  an 
abrupt  topographic  scarp  trends  toward  the  northeast 
along  the  base  of  the  uplifted  and  dissected  alluvial 
fan  deposits  which  overlie  Pacoima  and  Saugus  beds. 
The  best  development  of  this  scarp  is  just  east  of  Wil- 


son Canyon  channel  along  the  front  of  the  flat  where 
the  long,  tile-roofed  building  is  situated.  Here  the 
scarp  is  approximateh-  12  to  \5  m  (40  to  50  feet) 
high.  .\I)out  244  m  (ROO  feet)  east  of  Wilson  Canyon 
channel,  the  concrete  structure  of  the  Maclay  High 
Line  .Aqueduct  was  damaged  where  it  intersects  the 
scarp  and  had  to  be  excavated  and  repaired  there.  The 
scarp  has  been  dissected  b\-  a  small  canyon  about  488 
m  (1600  feet)  east  of  Wilson  Canyon  channel.  Near 
the  mouth  of  this  small  canyon,  clumps  of  reeds  lie 
on  a  line  nearK-  coincident  with  the  projected  trend  of 
the  scarp.  The  reeds  impl\-  a  near-surface  water  sup- 
ply, possibly  springs.  Farther  to  the  east,  the  scarp  is 
discontinuous  and  appears  to  bend  to  a  N.  60°  E.  di- 
rection across  the  slope  on  the  fanglomeratc  deposits 
west  of  May  Canyon  debris  dam.  That  the  abrupt 
aligned  changes  in  the  topograph)-  suggest  faulting 
is  well  demonstrated  by  the  Tujunga  segment  of  the 
San  Fernando  fault  zone.  While  there  ma\-  be  alterna- 
tive explanations  for  the  development  of  the  scarp 
described,  faulting  must  be  considered  as  an  entirely 
possible  cause. 

Evidence  from  the  mapped  geolog&gt;'  for  the  con- 
jectural fault  consists  of  the  observed  changes  in 
structure  both  east  and  west  of  the  canyon  north  of 
Ma\-  Can\on  debris  dam.  The  high-angle  fault  that 
separates  basement  rocks  from  the  Pacoima  Forma- 
tion does  not  continue  west  of  this  canyon.  The 
change  in  strike  of  bedding  across  this  canyon  and  the 
change  in  the  elevation  of  the  Saugus/Pacoima  con- 
tact, as  well,  suggest  that  a  fault  may  underlie  the 
alluvium  in  the  canyon.  Not  only  is  the  geologic 
structure  different  but  so  is  the  geomorphology  cast 
and  west  of  the  above  mentioned  canyon.  To  the 
east,  streams  flow  southwestward  and  westward 
toward  this  canyon;  but  only  small  gullies  have  de- 
veloped on  the  west  side.  However,  old  alluvial  fan 
deposits  which  cap  the  dissected  ridges  in  the  Pa- 
coima and  Saugus  Formations  are  dramatically  differ- 
ent in  degree  of  preservation  on  the  west  of  this 
can\on,  where  the  drainage  is  also  well  developed 
toward  the  southwest,  implying  a  tilting  in  that  direc- 
tion. The  implication  that  the  differences  in  these 
features  ma\'  have  been  the  result  of  differential 
structural  histories  on  either  side  of  this  canyon  sup- 
ports the  concept  of  a  fault  separating  them  as  shown 
on  the  geologic  map. 

Veterans  Fault 

This  fault  (47)  has  received  much  attention  be- 
cause it  is  the  only  example  of  surface  faulting  that 
could  be  found  associated  with  the  earthquake  in  the 
area  between  Pacoima  ^^'as!^  and  Olive  \''iew  near 
the  mountain  front.  \^er\"  detailed  mapping  has  not 
disclosed  any  additional,  similarly  notable,  tectonic 
features;  but  it  has  expanded  the  previously  mapped 
limits  of  surface  breakage  beyond  the  well-defined 
scarp  of  the  X'crcrans  fault. 

Surface  faulting  has  different  aspects  where  the 
surficial  materials  change  along  the  trace  of  the  Vet- 
erans fault.  A  well-defined  I5-to-20  cm  (6-to-8  inch) 
high  scarp  (photo  15)  could  be  followed  about  300  m 
(1000  feet)  across  graded  bedrock  surfaces  from 
Wallabv    A\enue    to    Grabcr    .\venue.    The    scarp

terminated  on  the  eastern  end  against  a  scarp  formed 
by  tiie  settlement  of  artificial  fill.  On  the  \\-est,  be- 
tween Grabcr  Avenue  and  CandleM-ood  Drive,  the 
faulting  did  not  produce  a  continuous  scarp;  but  it 
could  be  followed  as  an  alignment  of  humps,  cracks, 
and  damaged  houses.  This  120  m  (400  foot)  stretch 
transects  artificial  fill  and  stream  channel  deposits  of 
Loop  Canyon.  Possibly,  the  lack  of  Mell-exprcssed 
surface  breaks  in  these  unconsolidated  materials  is 
similar  to  that  discussed  in  relation  to  the  surface  ex- 
pression of  the  Oak  Hill  fault.

West  of  Candlewood  Drive,  surface  breakage 
could  be  traced  discontinuously  except  for  the  low 
scarp  on  top  of  the  old  alluvial  fan  deposits  which 
could  be  followed  for  120  m  (400  feet)  to  within 
390  m  (1280  feet)  of  the  collapsed  ^''eterans  Adminis- 
tration Hospital  buildings.  This  low  scarp  is  only  1 
to  5  cm  (0.5  to  2  inches)  high  (photo  16).  It  is  de- 
batable whether  the  surface  breakage  west  of  Candle- 
wood  Drive  is  a  manifestation  of  movements  along  a 
continuation  of  the  \\'ell-defined  Veterans  fault  to 
the  east.  There  are  certain  similarities  in  surface  ex-

pression  which  are  noted  below  although  the  western 
faulting  does  not  appear  to  be  parallel  to  bedding  in 
the  Saugus  Formation  as  is  that  along  the  Veterans 
fault. 

The  eastern  portion  of  the  Veterans  fault  paral- 
lels the  north-dipping  bedding  planes  in  the  Saugus 
Formation;  and,  from  Graber  Avenue  to  ^^'allaby 
Avenue,  the  Saugus  Formation  has  been  faulted 
against  later  Quaternary  terrace  deposits.  The  terrace 
deposits,  which  rest  on  tilted  Saugus  beds,  are  4  to  6 
m  (\5  to  20  feet)  thick  at  the  fault  as  measured  in 
the  cuts  on  the  east  side  of  Graber  Avenue.  This  in- 
dicates that  faulting  has  occurred  on  the  \^eterans 
fault  man\-  times  in  the  relatively  recent  past. 

Prior  to  the  grading  of  the  terrain  traversed  by 
the  Veterans  fault,  several  terrace  levels  were  visible 
there.  .Miller  (1928,  plate  32b)  presented  a  photo- 
graph which  shous  these  terraces.  Oakeshott  (1958, 
p.  87-88)  also  noticed  these  terraces  and  made  specific 
reference  to  them:  "Five  distinct  steps,  easily  seen  on 
the  west  side  of  Pacoima  Wash  and  well  marked  on 
the  1:24,000  Sylmar  topographic  map,  actually  repre-

sent  five  stages  of  deposition,  altliougli  tiie  oldest  and 
\"oungest  arc  separated  onl\'  250  feet  in  elevation." 
Using  the  1935  map,  to  wliicii  Oakcsliott  referred, 
and  tiic  photograph  presented  by  Miller,  it  is  possible 
to  plot  the  boundaries  of  these  terrace  levels  quite 
accurately  Superimposing  these  boundaries  on  the 
modern  topographic  map  at  the  same  scale  and  plot- 
ting the  trace  of  the  \''eterans  fault  reveals  a  nearly 
perfect  correlation  lictwcen  tiie  boundary  of  the  sec- 
ond and  third  levels  upslopc  and  the  trace  of  the 
fault.  The  lack  of  this  many  terrace  levels  imme- 
diately north  of  the  small  canyon  north  of  Wallaby 
Avenue,  where  one  would  expect  the  crosional  and 
depositional  regimes  to  I)e  almost  identical,  supports 
the  conclusion  that  faulting  on  the  \'eterans  fault  cre- 
ated two  levels  from  the  same  original  surface.  Natur- 
ally, without  exposures  of  the  fault,  this  extra  level 
would  lie  interpreted  as  another  terrace.  Topographic 
suggestions  of  relatively  young  faulting  are  much 
more  casil\-  perceived  on  tJic  older  topographic  maps 
because  of  the  5-  and  25-foot  contour  intervals  used 
on  them.  Additional  examples  of  the  utility  of  these 
maps  are  given  b\-  AVeber  (tiiis  Bulletin). 

.Man\-  have  searched  for  evidence  of  the  continua- 
tion of  the  Veterans  fault  both  east  and  west  of  its 
surface  expression.  To  the  east,  no  evidence  of  fault- 
ing was  found  in  Pacoima  Wash  or  across  the  paved 
road  east  of  the  wash  or  within  the  outcrops  of 
Saugus  Formation.  Pacoima  AVash,  of  course,  is  filled 
with  loose,  coarse  alluvium  which  could  easily  dis- 
perse the  effects  of  faulting  of  the  magnitude  of  that 
which  developed  along  the  Veterans  fault. 

Interpretations,  by  others,  of  the  various  earth- 
quake-produced features  beyond  the  western  end  of 
the  well-de\eloped  scarp  which  extends  to  Graber 
.\venuc  arc  different  from  those  presented  below. 
Kami)  and  others  (1971,  p.  51)  show  a  dasjied  contin- 
uation on  their  map  and  state  that  "a  southwestward 
extension  of  about  250  m  be\-ond  the  recognizable 
scarp  is  defined  by  a  zone  of  major  structural  damage 
to  houses."  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  staff  (1971, 
p.  72)  also  were  of  the  opinion  that  faulting  might 
continue  toward  the  southwest,  noting  that  "a  short 
scarp  with  vertical  offset  observed  on  Hubbard  Street 
[Gavina  Avenue]  would  have  a  southwcstcrI\'  trend." 
They  also  considered  an  alternative  interpretation  of 
the  break  across  Gavina  Avenue,  saying  that  "although 
the  rupture  has  the  appearance  of  a  tectonic  feature, 
it  conceivably  could  represent  the  bulged  toe  of  an 
unexpectedl\'  large  landslide  whose  upslope  limits 
have  not  been  recognized." 

Those  surface  effects  which  extend  to  the  south- 
west across  Gavina  Avenue  and  continue  across  nu- 
merous streets  in  a  line  almost  parallel  to  and  just  east 
of  Hubbard  Street  consist  of  unusually  heavy  damage 
to  houses  (Kamb  and  others,  1971)  and  of  numerous 
cracks  across  streets  and  curhings.  These  effects  are 
shown  in  plate  3.  Comparison  of  the  geologic  (plate 
2)  and  surface  effects  maps  (plate  3)  shows  that  this 
zone  of  effects  corresponds  to  the  boundary  between 
old  alluvial  fan  deposits  and  alluvium.  This  pre-exist- 
ing change  in  slope,  which  is  still  visible  trending  west 
across  a  field  southwest  of  Simshaw  Avenue,  was 
modified  during  grading  operations;  and  differentia! 


movements  in  the  materials  underKing  this  area  were 
probably  responsible  for  the  stronger  surface  effects. 
The  break  on  Gaxina  A\enue  referred  to  b\-  the  U.S. 
Geological  Surve\-  (1971)  overlies  the  buried  bound- 
ary- of  the  old  channel  of  Loop  Canyon;  and,  there- 
fore, it,  too,  may  be  a  result  of  differential  response 
of  natural  materials  and  artificial  fill. 

The  interpretation  that  the  \'cterans  fault  surface 
breakage  continues  to  the  west  rather  than  to  the 
southwest  is  based  upon  both  observed  earthquake- 
produced  effects,  some  of  which  are  enumerated 
above,  and  on  very  detailed  geologic  mapping  b)- 
F.  H.  Weber,  Jr.,  in  the  vicinit&gt;-  of  the  hillside  west 
of  Candlewood  Drive.  The  Saugus  Formation  is  well 
exposed  in  the  large  roadcut  at  the  bend  in  Hubbard 
Street.  Tiie  Saugus  beds  are  unconformabh-  overlain 
by  alhnial  fan  deposits  which  underlie  the  entire  \^ct- 
erans  .Administration  Hospital  site.  The  contact  be- 
tween the  Saugus  and  fan  deposits  can  be  followed 
northward  to  a  southeast-trending  gully  about  90  m 
(300  feet)  north  of  Hubbard  Street.  This  gully  con- 
tains slope  wash  debris  and  thick  brush  which  conceal 
the  contact.  It  is  exposed,  however,  on  the  north  side 
of  the  gully.  This  contact  appears  to  be  a  minimum  of 
7.6  m  (25  feet)  higher  there  than  it  would  be  if  it 
were  projected  from  the  place  where  it  is  last  seen  on 
the  south  side  of  the  gull\'.  These  observations  have 
been  interpreted  as  the  locus  of  a  fault  which  exhibits 
similar  total  vertical  displacement  to  the  \'eterans 
fault  farther  east.  Excavation  of  the  debris  in  the  gully 
would  remove  the  current  ambiguities  in  the  interpre- 
tation. The  fault,  described  above,  which  strikes  across 
the  flat  (photo  16)  can  be  traced  directly  to  this 
gully.  .Although  there  are  minor  cracks  at  various 
places  on  the  \'eterans  Administration  Hospital  site, 
no  other  surface  faulting  was  observed  near  the  hos- 
pital buildings. 

Additional  Surface  Effects  West  of  Pacoima  Wash 

The  features  associated  with  the  \'cterans  fault 
have  received  much  attention  because  they  are  the 
only  recognized  expression  of  surface  faulting  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  tragedy  at  the  \'eterans  .Administration 
Hospital.  Elsewhere  along  the  mountain  front,  how- 
ever, two  other  kinds  of  surface  effects  were  observed 
which  provide  a  record  of  the  severe  ground  motion 
there.  Of  these  two,  shattered  ridge  tops  are  less 
common  but  are  identical  in  appearance  to  those  al- 
ready described  east  of  Pacoima  Wash  where  they 
are  relatively  abundant.  North  of  the  V^eterans  fault 
and  north  of  ^Vallaby  Avenue  (48),  there  is  a  rem- 
nant of  original  terrain  that  was  left  unmodified  dur- 
ing the  grading  operations  in  the  area.  This  low  ridge 
is  underlain  by  north-dipping  beds  of  the  Saugus 
Formation  with  a  thin  veneer  of  Quaternary  terrace 
deposits  on  top.  These  terrace  deposits  were  violently 
disrupted  and  shattered  during  the  earthquake  (photo 
17).  Although  shattering  is  not  common  in  this  area, 
it  does  occur  elsewhere.  In  Loop  Canyon  north  of 
the  Pacoima-basement  rock  contact,  two  narrow 
ridges  of  dioritic  gneiss,  capped  b\-  thin  terrace  de- 
posits, are  likewise  shattered  (45).  Other  terrace  de- 
posits in  this  vicinity  are  not  shattered.

Probably,  the  shattering  was  localized  at  these 
places  because  the  combination  of  a  narrow  bedrock 
ridge  capped  by  thin  terrace  deposits  provided  the 
necessary  conditions.  Shattering  on  Sngarloaf  (108) 
east  of  Lopez  Canyon  also  occurred  in  terrace  deposits 
overlying  Saugus  beds.  In  detail,  shattering  there 
developed  only  where  the  terrace  deposits  are  thin 
and  the  ridge  top  is  relatively  narrow.  In  contrast, 
shattering  did  not  appear  to  develop  on  the  top  of 
Sugarloaf  (108),  where  the  terrace  deposits  are 
thicker  and  the  ridge  is  broader. 

Shattered  ridge  tops  are  not  common  between 
the  \^eterans  Administration  Hospital  site  and  Olive 
\^iew  probably  because  the  appropriate  geological 
and  topographical  conditions  are  not  present  there.  A 
few  narrow  ridges  underlain  by  north-dipping  Paco- 
ima  beds  are  shattered  just  west  of  the  Veterans  Ad- 
ministration Hospital  site. 

Slope  failures  are  much  more  common  than  shat- 
tering in  this  area.  The  typical  failure  is  characterized 
by  the  downslope  movement  of  soil  predominantly 
on  the  north  sides  of  east-west-trending  ridges.  This 
effect  is  especially  common  on  the  north  slopes  of 
ridges  in  the  Pacoima  Formation  east  of  Olive  View 
Hospital  (plate  3).  One  uncommonly  large  landslide 
did  occur  west  of  Loop  Canyon  (plate  3).  The  edge 
breakage  in  old  alluvial  fan  deposits  northeast  of  the 
Veterans  Administration  Hospital  is  a  typical  example 
of  bank  failure  (photo  18). 

The  permanent  change  in  the  shapes  of  man-made 
structures  relative  to  their  surroundings  provides  a 
record  of  the  vector  of  greatest  ground  motion  dur- 
ing the  earthquake;  for  example,  the  main  Olive  Vie\\' 
Hospital  building,  the  roofs  of  collapsed,  partially 
constructed  houses  near  the  Veterans  fault  (photo 
17),  a  large  log  lodge  north  of  Wilson  Canyon  debris 
dam  (photo  19),  and  many  of  the  older  structures  at 
the  Olive  View  site  that  moved  off  their  foundation-" 
and  were  not  built  on  filled  ground.  All  of  these 
structures  provide  an  indication  of  the  inertial  effect 
on  structures  which  were  unable  to  return  to  their 


original  location  or  shape  after  the  passage  of  earth- 
quake ground  waves.  The  predominant  failure  of 
north-facing  slopes  in  this  vicinity  is  analogous. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The  myriad  surface  effects  of  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  have  been  intensively  investigated  and  re- 
corded in  great  detail.  During  the  study  of  the  geol- 
ogy of  the  area  where  the  effects  are  most  abundant, 
heavy  emphasis  \\'as  placed  upon  learning  about  those 
features  which  might  have  indicated,  before  the  earth- 
quake, something  about  what  could  have  been  ex- 
pected. Major  structural  features  were  also  examined 
because  their  position  or  orientation  and  inferred^ 
structural  history  is  analogous  to  that  of  structures 
that  were  active  during  this  event.  The  greatest  utility 
of  this  work  will  be  in  the  application  of  what  has 
been  learned  here  to  other  areas  where  youthfulness 
of  surface  faulting  is  suspected.  Many  of  the  observa- 
tions and  conclusions  from  this  study  are  presented 
in  the  following  list. 

Little  Tujunga  Canyon  to  Pacoima  Wash 

1.  Movements  on  the  Tujunga  segment  of  the 
San  Fernando  fault  zone  created  abundant  scarps, 
ridges,  mole  tracks,  and  cracks  that  were  concentrated 
along  the  base  of  the  foothills  between  Little  Tujunga 
Canyon  and  Pacoima  Wash. 

2.  Surface  faulting  along  the  Tujunga  segment 
is  expressed  over  a  relatively  broad  zone  extending 
as  much  as  hundreds  of  feet  north  of  the  compres- 
sional  scarps  at  the  edge  of  the  thrust. 

3.  In  addition  to  the  predominant  dip-slip  com- 
ponent, a  significant  left-lateral  component  of  dis- 
placement is  characteristic  of  most  of  the  surface 
faulting  within  this  area. 

4.  Surface  faulting  on  such  faults  as  the  Kagel, 
which  transects  the  strike  of  enclosing  strata,  and  the 
Oak  Hill,  which  parallels  bedding,  was  widespread

north  of  the  Tujunga  segment,  mostly  within  1200  m 
(4000  feet)  of  the  frontal  scarps. 

5.  Damage  from  surface  faulting  in  the  Tujunga 
segment  was  restricted  to  roads  and  utilities  and  af- 
fected very  few  buildings  because  of  the  sparsity  of 
buildings  in  the  area. 

6.  The  best-developed  scarps  resulting  from  sur- 
face faulting  cross  areas  that  had  been  artificially 
graded  so  that  bedrock  was  exposed. 

7.  A  record  of  previous  faulting  on  the  Tujunga 
segment  was  revealed  in  a  trench  which  exposed  more 
than  13  m  (43  feet)  of  Tertiary  sedimentary  rocks 
overlving  alluvium. 

8.  At  one  locality,  the  juxtaposition,  by  faulting, 
of  slope  wash  deposits  over  alluvial  material  along  the 
Tujunga  segment  implies  ver&gt;'  youthful  movement 
prior  to  the  earthquake  on  this  fault  zone. 

9.  Trenches  excavated  across  mole  tracks  in  un- 
consolidated alluvium  were  of  little  or  no  value  for 
determining  details  of  faulting  because  of  the  absence 
of  marker  units  which   might  have   been   displaced. 

10.  .'\pplication  of  the  techniques  of  very  detailed 
mapping  (scales  as  large  as  1:2400)  to  the  search  for 
potentialiv  active  or  young  faults  would  have  re- 
vealed, in  natural  as  well  as  artificial  exposures,  both 
the  existence  and  the  youtJifulness  of  the  Tujunga 
fault  segment  before  the  earthquake. 

11.  The   highest   scarps   and   greatest   offsets   on 


the  Tujunga  fault  segment  occur  toward  its  eastern 
and  western  ends.  It  is  probable  that  the  different  as- 
pect in  tiie  central  portion,  characterized  by  multiple 
scarps,  is  a  result  of  movements  along  the  Kagel  fault. 

12.  No  reactivation  as  a  result  of  the  earthquake 
was  observed  on  the  Little  Tujunga  fault,  the  Lopez 
fault,  or  Buck  Canyon  fault— all  members  of  the 
Sierra  Aladre  fault  system,  which  separates  basement 
rocks  from  Pleistocene  sedimentary  rocks. 

13.  The  above-mentioned  faults  are  covered  in 
many  places  by  old  fan  and  terrace  deposits  which 
are  undisturbed.  The  youthfulness  of  the  rocks  in- 
volved in  faulting  along  the  Tujunga  segment  implies 
a  change  in  activity  in  relativeh'  recent  time  toward 
the  southernmost  fault  of  the  Sierra  .Madrc  "family". 

14.  Comparison  of  the  geologic  map  and  surface 
effects  map  demonstrates  the  lithologic  and  topo- 
graphic control  over  the  distribution  of  landslides  and 
rockfalls. 

15.  Reactivation  of  the  very  large  landslides  that 
characterize  the  basement  terrain  north  of  and  across 
faults  of  the  Sierra  .Madre  s&gt;stem  was  ver&gt;'  limited. 
Debris  in  some  of  these  slides  moved  from  shaking, 
hut  the  slides  did  not  move  downslope  as  a  body. 

16.  .-Ml  of  the  large  rockfalls  did  not  occur  at  the 
time  of  the  main  earthquake.  Those  that  fell  later, 
especially  large  ones  near  Pacoima  Dam,  are  cxaniples 
of  geologic  hazards  that  must  be  recognized  and  iden-

tificd  during  rapid  reconnaissance  of  tiie  area  affected 
by  the  earthquake  by  experienced  personnel. 

17.  The  surface  breakage  associated  with  differ- 
ential settling  of  artificially  filled  land  relative  to 
natural  ground  was  particularly  damaging  to  roads 
and  other  paved  areas. 

18.  Shattered  ridge  tops  that  resemble  plowed 
ground  are  a  spectacular  and  relatively  widespread 
feature  of  this  earthquake  and  are  indicative  of  a  con- 
centration of  shaking  energy.  This  feature  was  local- 
ized along  the  tops  of  angular  peaks  or  ridges  where 
soil  or  terrace  cover  is  thin.  It  also  developed  in  sand- 
stone strata  on  sharp  ridges. 

19.  Earthquake  effects  were  concentrated  along 
the  contact  between  the  Towsley/Pico  and  Saugus 
Formations.  Shattered  ridges,  strong  shaking  reflected 
in  heavy  damage  to  structures  and  water  tanks, 
ground  cracks  and  minor  bedding-plane  faults  arc  all 
much  more  abundant  in  the  vicinity  of  this  contact. 
Post-earthquake  surveying  data,  gathered  by  others, 
support  the  field  observations  of  a  concentration  of 
effects  along  this  contact  by  indicating  that  the  area 
of  greatest  permanent  change  in  elevation  coincides,  in 
general,  with  this  contact. 

Pacoima  Canyon  to  Wilson  Canyon 

1.  The  only  e.xample  of  surface  faulting  near  the 
mountain  front  in  this  vicinity  is  the  \^etcrans  fault, 
which  can  be  traced  as  a  well-defined  scarp  for  300  m 
(1000  feet)  across  an  artificially  graded  bedrock  sur- 
face and  for  an  additional  120  m  (400  feet)  across  fill 
and  alluvium. 

2.  Along  the  Veterans  fault,  Quaternary  terrace 
deposits  are  4  to  6  m  (15  to  20  feet)  thick  where  they 
are  juxtaposed  against  Saugus  Formation,  providing  a 
record  of  previous  youthful  activity  on  this  fault. 

3.  Before  grading  of  the  terrain  traversed  by  the 
Veterans  fault,  topographic  evidence  was  ambiguous 
and  was  logically  interpreted  as  a  change  in  level  be- 
tween t\vo  terraces  where  there  appeared  to  be  five 
such  levels. 


4.  West  of  the  surface  effects  directly  associated 
with  the  Veterans  fault,  a  low  fault  scarp  that  crosses 
the  flat  surface  of  an  old  alluvial  fan  can  be  traced  to 
within  390  m  (1280  feet)  of  the  V^etcrans  Admin- 
istration Hospital.  An  apparent  offset,  a  minimum  of 
7.6  m  (25  feet),  of  the  contact  between  Saugus  Forma- 
tion and  overlying  alluvial  fan  deposits  in  a  gully  at 
the  eastern  end  of  this  scarp  suggests  prior  youthful 
activity  on  this  fault  similar  to  that  cited  above  along 
the  Veterans  fault. 

5.  Northeast  of  the  Veterans  Administration  Hos- 
pital, the  basement  complex  has  been  thrust  over 
Pleistocene  Pacoima  Formation  along  a  fault  that  dips 
20°  N.  North  of  the  Veterans  Administration  Hos- 
pital, the  Pacoima  rests  on  basement  rocks  in  a  deposi- 
tional  contact.  West  of  Loop  Canyon  to  the  can\'on 
north  of  May  Can\'on  debris  dam,  the  contact  between 
basement  rocks  and  Pacoima  Formation  is  a  steeply 
south-dipping  to  vertical  normal  fault.  West  of  this 
canyon,  the  Pacoima  Formation  sits  depositionally 
upon  the  basement  rocks  and  is  unconformably  over- 
lain by  an  uplifted  and  dissected  alluvial  fan. 

6.  A  conjectural  fault  has  been  inferred  on  the 
basis  of  a  topographic  scarp  and  geologic  relations 
along  the  base  of  the  foothills  bet\veen  Wilson  Can- 
yon Channel  and  the  canyon  north  of  the  May  Can- 
yon debris  dam. 

7.  In  this  region  there  was  no  surface  faulting 
resulting  from  the  earthquake  along  the  basement-sedi- 
mentary rock  contact  or  along  the  trend  of  the  con- 
jectural fault. 

8.  The  heavy  structural  damage  in  this  vicinity 
was  related  to  severe  shaking.  The  failure  by  edge 
cracking  and  downslope  movement,  especially  of 
north-facing  slopes,  is  analogous  to  the  effects  ex- 
hibited by  man-made  structures  which  were  unable 
to  return  to  their  original  location  or  shape  after  the 
passage  of  the  initial  earthquake  ground  motion.  These 
features  recorded  the  inertial  effect  of  bodies  sub- 
jected to  a  south-  or  southwest-trending  vector  of 
ground  motion. 


CHAPTER    8 


Surface  Effects  and  Related  Geology  of  the  Lakeview 
Fault  Segment  of  the  San  Fernando  Fault  Zone 


by  James  E.  Kahle  ' 


ABSTRACT 

The  San  Fernando  earthquake  was  caused  by  move- 
ment on  a  zone  of  thrust  faults  dipping  northward  into 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  The  movement  was  accom- 
panied by  surface  faulting  which  was  subsequently  mapped 
as  several  separate  fault  segments  collectively  named  the 
San  Fernando  fault  zone.  One  part  of  this  fault  zone, 
called  the  Lakeview  fault  segment,  is  described  in  this 
report. 

Such  evidence  for  surface  faulting  as  vertical  dis- 
placement, cracking  adjacent  to  the  scarp,  and  landsliding 
along  the  trace  is  compelling  and  is  discussed  in  detail. 
It  was  necessary  to  map  the  related  geology  in  detail  to 
establish  the  character  and  magnitude  of  previous  faulting 
on  the  thrust.  Gathering  the  evidence  needed  to  delineate 
the  fault  trace  and  to  understand  the  geologic  history  of 
the  thrust  was  facilitated  by  the  excellent  exposures  formed 
by  fault-triggered  landslides.  At  least  475  m  (1550  feet) 
of  pre-earthquake  movement  was  measured  on  the  fault. 
An  attempt  was  made  to  evaluate  the  evidence  available, 
exclusive  of  surface  effects,  to  determine  whether  the  fault 
might  hove  been  recognized  as  active  prior  to  the  earth- 
quake. Its  age  could  have  been  determined  as  Holocene; 
its  potential  for  renewed  activity  would  have  been  recog- 
nized; but  no  consensus  regarding  its  potential  for  disaster 
could  have  been  expected. 

In  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9, 
1971,  surface  faulting  occurred,  rather  unexpectedly, 
from  the  area  north  of  jMission  San  Fernando  to  Sun- 
land  on  an  alignment  subsequent!)'  called  the  San  Fer- 
nando fault  zone.  Surface  faulting  on  the  Santa  Susana 
fault  zone  is  described  elsewhere  in  this  Bulletin 
(Weber;  Saul).  The  Lakeview  segment  of  the  San  Fer- 
nando fault  zone,  here  called  the  Lakeview  fault,  broke 
the  surface  of  the  ground  over  a  linear  distance  of  6.8 
km  (4.2  miles)  between  Kagel  Canyon  and  Big  Tu- 
junga  Canyon  (shown  on  plate  2  in  red  and  on  plate  3). 
Rocks  of  Miocene  age  were  thrust  upward  and  south- 
southwestward  an  average  of  80-120  cm  (2.5^.0  feet) 
over  rocks  of  Holocene  and/or  Pleistocene  age  in  this 
earthquake.  Surface  faulting  occurred  along  a  com- 
plex, north-dipping  fault  plane  which  trends  approxi- 
mately N.  70°  W.  Scarps  were  formed  in  the  alluvium 
of  Tujunga  Valley  and  along  the  frontal  slopes  of  the 
foothills  westward  across  ridges,  hillsides,  and  canyon 
bottoms  as  far  as  Kagel  Canyon.  Many  small  landslides 
and  other  surface  effects  mark  the  trace  of  the  fault  in 
the  hills  north  of  Tujunga  Valley.

The  hilly  area  covered  in  this  report  is  not  heavily 
developed;  consequently,  damage  was  relatively  light 
as  compared  to  other  areas  affected  by  the  earthquake 
(Weber,  this  Bulletin;  Slosson,  this  Bulletin).  Several 
houses,  utility  lines,  and  roads  in  Kagel  Canyon  and 
the  roads  and  utilities  in  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  and 
Big  Tujunga  Canyon  were  damaged  by  surface  break- 
age on  the  Lakeview  fault. 

Detailed  mapping  of  the  surface  breaks  and  the  re- 
lated geology  has  been  in  progress  since  the  earth- 
quake. The  purpose  of  this  mapping  was  a)  to  record 
as  fully  as  possible  the  surface  breaks  and  other  sur- 
face effects  formed  at  the  time  of  the  earthquake 
(plate  3);  b)  to  identify  any  potentially  hazardous 
conditions  caused  by  the  earthquake;  and  c)  to  under- 
stand the  complex  geological  history  of  this  well- 
exposed  active  thrust  fault. 

These  studies  will  provide  a  data  base  for  contin- 
uing observations  of  the  long-term  effects  of  the  earth- 
quake on  this  area.  Observations  of  the  climatological 
modification  of  the  disturbed  ground  surface — espe- 
cially in  areas  where  potential  hazards  from  landslide, 
mudflow,  and  rapid  erosion  might  develop — will  be 
necessary  for  many  years.  A  clear  understanding  of 
the  detailed  geology  of  this  once  poorly  recognized 
and  very  complex  part  of  a  larger  active  fault  system 
may  help  in  the  identification  of  other  as  yet  unrecog- 
nized active  faults  in  California.  Hopefully,  it  will  also 
provide  some  information  on  how  often  future  earth- 
quakes are  likely  to  occur  in  this  and  other  areas 
if  enough  is  learned  about  its  history. 

The  detail  shown  along  the  Lakeview  fault  on  plate 
2  is  only  representative  of  the  complex  geology  and 
does  not  impl_\'  that  the  work  is  complete  enough  to 
serve  all  the  above  purposes.  Enough  has  been  done 
to  demonstrate  the  great  value  of  such  detailed  work 
and  to  provide  a  firm  foundation  for  future  observa- 
tions and  continuing  study. 

The  earthquake  called  attention  to  the  complex  geo- 
logic setting  of  the  Lakeview  fault  and  made  it  neces- 
sary to  modify  much  of  the  existing  geologic  map- 
ping. Approximately  2  km  (IV4  miles)  of  the  Lake- 
view  fault  had  been  recognized  before  the  earthquake 
and  discussed  in  an  unpublished  report  (Jahns  and 
others,  1970).  Surface  faulting  coincided  with  some 
sections  of  other  previously  mapped  faults  (Barrows; 
Weber;  Saul;  this  Bulletin)  but  at  only  a  few  places 
in  the  area  of  this  report.  Significant  differences  in  the 
interpretation  of  the  geology  arc  discussed  in  the  sec- 
tions on  rock  t&gt;pes  and  structure.  Minor  differences 
are  discussed  in  the  section  on  surface  effects.

The  general  geology  of  the  area  between  Little 
Tujunga  Canyon  and  Big  Tujunga  Canyon  is  outlined 
briefly  in  the  sections  on  descriptive  geology  and 
structure.  .More  detailed  discussions  arc  included  for 
the  area  immediately  adjacent  to  the  Lakeview  fault. 

The  major  part  of  this  report  concerns  the  varied 
surface  effects  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  in  the 
region  between  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  and  Big  Tu- 
junga Canyon.  Surface  faulting,  the  most  significant 
effect,  is  described  from  west  to  east  a  short  section 
at  a  time.  Such  additional  effects,  as  cracks  in  soil, 
landslides  and  rockfalls,  shattered  ridges,  and  failure 
of  fills  are  discussed  under  separate  headings.  Where 
these  effects  are  adjacent  to  the  surface  faulting,  they 
are  included  with  the  sectional  descriptions. 

Numbers,  alone  and  within  parentheses  in  the 
text,  refer  to  localities  on  the  surface  effects  map 
(plate  3).  Measurements  indicated  on  this  map,  in  the 
Lakeview  fault  area,  are  accurate  within  ±2  cm  (54 
inch)  in  most  cases. 

DESCRIPTIVE  GEOLOGY 
Pre- Tertiary   Rocks 

The  prc-Tertiary  rocks  of  the  basement  com- 
plex are  described  fully  by  Oakeshott  (1958)  and  by 
Fhlig  (this  Bulletin).  These  are  the  source  rocks  for 
most  of  the  Quaternary  deposits  described  in  this  re- 
port. Because  of  the  wide  v^ariety  of  rock  types  pres- 
ent, it  was  not  feasible,  in  the  present  study,  to  try  to 
identify  any  specific  source  areas  for  particular  de- 
posits. 

Tertiary  Rocks 

Topanga  Formatioii.  The  only  rocks  of  the  To- 
panga  Formation  exposed  within  the  mapped  area  are 
basalt  flows  north  of  the  Sunland  fault.  Most  of  the 
geology  shown  on  plate  2  in  this  vicinit&gt;'  was  compiled 
from  Beatie  (1958)  who  described  the  Topanga  For- 
mation in  considerable  detail.  Oakeshott  (1958,  p.  64) 
characterized  these  rocks  as  "black  compact  vesicular 
basalt  with  no  visible  phenocrysts  ...  in  a  series  of 
flows  alternating  with  beds  of  coarse  reddish-brown 
breccia."  Sharp  (1934)  mapped  part  of  the  Modelo 
Formation,  shown  on  plate  2  north  of  the  Sunland 
fault,  as  rocks  of  the  Topanga  Formation.  He  also 
mapped  some  of  the  patches  of  Modelo  to  the  west  as 
Topanea  rocks,  but  the  more  recent  work  was  fol- 
lowed for  this  report. 

Modelo  FoYDiation.  Rocks  of  the  Modelo  Forma- 
tion above  the  Lakeview  fault  are  mostly  thin-bedded, 
silty,  and  occasionally  siliceous  shale  intcrbedded  with 
fine-grained  arkosic  sandstone.  A  few  thin  diatoma- 
ccous  shale  beds  and  minor  arkosic  conglomerate  beds 
are  present.  These  rocks  are  probably  correlative  with 
the  middle  or  upper  part  of  the  Alodelo  Formation 
to  the  west.  Rocks,  probably  correlative  with  the 
lower  part  of  the  Modelo  Formation,  crop  out  below 
the  Lakeview  thrust  from  Schwartz  Canyon  eastward 
to  the  Lakeview  Terrace  Sanitarium.  Beds  of  coarse- 
to  fine-grained,  buff  to  &gt;el!owish-brown  arkosic  sand- 
stone and  pebble  conglomerate  predominate  here.  Sili- 


ceous shale  beds  of  the  Modelo  Formation  are  in  fault 
contact  with,  and  underlie,  silty  shale  and  sandstone 
beds  of  the  Modelo  Fomiation  on  the  slopes  imme- 
diately east  of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon. 

ToivsJey/Pico  Fontjation  (undifferentiated). 
Conglomerate,  sandstone,  and  dark  gray  shale  over- 
I\'ing  the  Modelo  Formation  conformably  in  this  area 
are  referred  to  as  Towsley/Pico  Formation.  These  are 
called  the  Repetto  Formation  by  Oakeshott  (1958) 
and  may  be  correlative  with  rocks  of  the  Towsley 
Formation  farther  west;  meager  collections  of  early 
Pliocene  fossils  in  the  Little  Tujunga  area  were  made 
by  Hill,  Oakeshott,  and  Howell  (Oakeshott,  1958,  p. 
79).  Steep  cliffs  formed  by  the  resistant  conglomerate 
beds  of  the  Towsley/Pico  Formation  characterize 
the  contact  with  soft  shale  beds  of  the  Modelo  For- 
mation. Large  landslides  in  the  shale  beds  along  this 
contact  commonly  contain  large  blocks  of  the  con- 
glomerate. Several  of  these  landslides  were  partially 
reactivated  during  the  earthquake.  An  exceptionally 
large  one  in  Schwartz  Canyon  (plate  2)  had  a  fresh 
10  m  (32-foot)  scarp  at  its  head  near  the  ridge  top. 
In  places,  the  toe  of  the  slide  dammed  the  stream 
channel. 

Saugus  Fontiation.  The  area  underlain  by  the 
Saugus  Formation  was  not  mapped  in  detail.  It  is 
characterized  by  poorly  to  moderately  consolidated, 
light-gray  pebbly  conglomerate  and  medium-  to 
coarse-grained  sandstone  with  interbedded,  reddish- 
brown  mudstone  layers.  Beatie  (1958)  and  Oakeshott 
(1958)  described  the  Saugus  Formation  fully. 

Quaternary  Rocks 

"Thnist  sequence''.  Young  rocks,  probably  late 
Pleistocene  through  Holocene,  have  been  overridden 
hundreds  of  meters  by  rocks  of  Miocene  age  to  form 
the  stratigraphic  sequence  which  helps  to  identify  the 
Lakeview  thrust  fault.  This  closely  related  sequence  of 
rocks  under  the  thrust  plane  is  called  the  "thrust  se- 
quence" in  this  report  for  convenience.  It  is  a  distinc- 
tive and  mappable  unit  and  may  be  analogous  to  other 
rock  sequences  perhaps  present  under  other  active 
thrust  faults  in  adjacent  areas.  This  sequence  of  rocks 
is  as  vital  to  the  interpretation  of  the  Lakeview  fault  as 
the  surface  breaks.  Three  members,  whose  contacts 
are  largely  gradational,  can  be  conveniently  differen- 
tiated. In  this  report  and  on  plate  2,  they  include  an 
older  alluvial  terrace  gravel  (Qot);  a  mi.xed  sedimen- 
tary unit  called  alluvium-breccia  (Qab);  and  a  breccia 
unit  (Qbx)  which  is  believed  to  be  largely  tectonic 
but  partly  sedimentary  in  origin.  The  inferred  age  of 
this  sequence  ranges  from  the  present  to  more  than 
60,000  years  old  and  is  probab!\-  much  older.  The  evi- 
dence for  this  age  is  discussed  in  the  section  on  the 
Lakeview  fault. 

Older  terrace  gravel.  The  older  terrace  gravel  is 
an  unconsolidated  to  poorly  consolidated  unit  consist- 
ing of  interbedded  boulder  gravel  and  bouldery 
cobble-to-pebble  gravel  which  is  25-30  m  (80-100 
feet)  thick  containing  discontinuous  lenses  and  layers 
of  coarse-grained  sand  and  fine-pebble  gravel.  Bedding

is  vague  to  invisible  and  very  irregular,  both  laterally 
and  vertically.  In  both  composition  and  texture,  this 
unit  closely  resembles  the  alluvium  of  Big  Tujunga 
Wash  and  Tujunga  Valley,  suggesting  a  similar  source 
and  fluviatile  deposition.  Igneous  and  metamorphic 
clasts,  most  likely  derived  from  the  basement  complex 
to  the  north,  predominate.  Clasts  of  anorthosite  are 
common.  A  few  volcanic  clasts  and  rare  clasts  of  sedi- 
mentary rocks  which  resemble  rocks  of  the  Modelo 
Formation  or  Towsley/Pico  Formations  are  present. 

Outcrops  of  older  terrace  gravel  are  nearly  con- 
tinuous along  the  front  of  the  foothills  between  Little 
Tujunga  Canyon  and  the  Lake  view  Terrace  Sani- 
tarium. East  of  Schwartz  Canyon,  the  base  rests  on 
eroded  and  truncated  beds  of  the  lower  Modelo  For- 
mation 25-35  m  (80-115  feet)  above  the  base  of  the 
hills.  Westward  from  Schwartz  Canyon,  the  base  of 
this  unit  is  buried  by  modern  alluvium.  Most  of  the 
unit  is  not  covered  since  the  thickness  of  the  exposed 
part  is  still  greater  than  25  m  (80  feet). 

The  older  terrace  gravel  thickens  to  30  m  (100 
feet)  or  more  along  the  base  of  the  hill  east  of  Little 
Tujunga  Canyon  where  shale  of  the  Modelo  Forma- 
tion appears  to  be  in  fault(?)  contact  above  it.  This 
ancestral  part  of  the  Lakeview  fault  zone  did  not  move 
during  the  earthquake.  Higher  on  this  hill  another 
imbricate,  and  possibly  contemporaneous,  sequence  of 
terrace  gravel  lies  depositionally  on  top  of  the  first 
shale  unit.  More  shale  of  the  Modelo  Formation  lies 
above  this  gravel  unit,  also  in  fault  (?)  contact,  sug- 
gesting a  sequence  of  imbricate  thrust  faults  which  is 
discussed  more  fully  below  (plate  2). 

This  unit  has  been  mapped  previously  as  terrace 
gravel  but  only  as  remnants  of  a  partly  eroded  surface 
deposit  along  the  base  of  the  hills  (Sharp,  1934; 
Howell,  1949;  Beatie,  1958;  Oakeshort,  1958).  At  one 
locality,  just  west  of  Oliver  Canyon  (129),  Oakeshott 
showed  rocks  of  the  Modelo  Formation  thrust  over 
older  terrace  gravel  with  the  fault  dipping  north  60°. 
Howell  showed  the  same  fault  dipping  64°  N.  but 
within  rocks  of  the  Modelo  Formation. 

Alluvitmi-breccia.  This  unit  is  probably  transi- 
tional between  the  older  terrace  gravel  and  the  breccia 
unit  of  the  "thrust  sequence."  It  is  well  exposed  by 
recent  slides.  Beds  containing  clasts  of  well-rounded 
fluviatile  sand  and  pebble-size  material  derived  from 
the  basement  complex  are  mixed  with  angular  pebble- 
size  shale  clasts  derived  directly  from  the  nearby  Mo- 
delo Formation.  The  percentage  of  silt-  and  sand-size 
material  is  greater  in  this  unit  than  in  the  older  terrace 
gravel  or  the  modern  alluvium,  suggesting  that  some 
of  this  finer  grained  detritus  may  also  have  been  de- 
rived from  the  Modelo  Formation  nearby.  Bedding  is 
vague  to  well  defined.  The  unit  is  generally  mod- 
erately consolidated  to  unconsolidated. 

Another  common  type  of  bedding  in  this  unit 
contains  a  high  percentage  of  clay,  silt,  and  fine-sand 
clasts  mixed  with  coarse  angular  shale  debris  but  con- 
tains only  a  few  well-rounded  clasts  of  basement  rock. 
It  closely  resembles  mudflow  or  debris  flow  material 
and  is  moderately  well  consolidated.  Where  not  well 
exposed  and  seen  only  as  surficial  debris,  it  is  easily 


mistaken  for  slope  wash  similar  to  that  derived  di- 
rectly from  the  Alodelo  Formation.  Locally,  layers  of 
caliche  can  be  seen  interbedded  with  these  "flow" 
layers  suggesting  that  this  and  the  other  mi.xed  beds 
may  have  accumulated  downslope  from  a  nearby  rap- 
idly eroding  area  of  moderately  high  relief.  The  pres- 
ent position  and  structure  of  the  Lakeview  fault 
supports  speculation  that  an  ancient  fault  scarp  may 
have  been  situated  a  short  distance  to  the  north  while 
these  rocks  were  being  deposited.  This  would  probably 
be  an  area  of  high  relief  and  a  likely  source  of  debris 
for  contributing  material  to  an  area  of  general  fluvial 
deposition.  No  well-defined  contacts  between  this  unit 
and  those  above  and  below  it  were  observed.  The 
lower  contact  is  typified  by  a  sharp  change  in  grain 
size.  The  upper  contact  is  probably  gradational. 

Breccia.  The  breccia  unit  consists  exclusively  of 
debris  derived  from  shale  of  the  Modelo  Formation. 
The  material  in  this  debris  was  probably  formed  by 
brecciation  of  the  Modelo  shale  during  fault  move- 
ment, but  colluvium  from  this  source  appears  to  have 
been  partly  redistributed  by  sedimentary'  and  mass 
wasting  processes  and  to  have  accumulated  in  places 
as  thick,  wedge-shaped,  vaguely  bedded  layers.  It  oc- 
curs only  directly  beneath  the  thrust  plane.  It  is  com- 
monly white  to  light  gray  and  very  loose.  Along  a  few 
of  the  higher  ridges,  it  seems  to  have  accumulated  to  a 
thickness  of  5-10  m  (15-30  feet),  but  in  most  areas  it 
occurs  as  a  thin  discontinuous  layer  of  brecciated 
Modelo  shale  less  than  5  m  (15  feet)  thick.  Although 
it  may  be  present  nearly  everywhere  along  the  thrust, 
only  the  thicker  accumulations  are  shown  on  plate  2.  In 
a  few  places,  particularly  where  the  thrust  crosses  can- 
yon bottoms,  it  is  apparently  missing.  This  suggests 
that,  where  shale  of  the  Modelo  Formation  has  over- 
ridden the  older  alluvium  and  the  mixed  alluvium- 
breccia  for  only  a  short  distance,  significant  brecciation 
due  to  fault  movement  has  not  had  an  opportunity  to 
develop.  At  other  locations,  where  faulting  has  oc- 
curred on  bedding  planes  in  shale  of  the  Modelo  For- 
mation, little  gouge  or  debris  was  seen.  Perhaps  gouge 
and  fault  breccia  form  best  ^\■he^e  unlike  material  is 
juxtaposed  and  the  cumulative  displacement  is  very 
large. 

Older  albivimn  (undifferentiated).  Many  areas 
bordering  Big  Tujunga  Wash  and  Tujunga  Valley 
have  small  aprons  of  alluvial  fan  deposits  and  extensive 
deposits  of  inactive  flood  plain  alluvium  which  appear 
to  be  unaffected  by  present-day  flooding.  These  were 
combined  on  the  map  as  undifferentiated  older  allu- 
vium, except  in  a  few  places,  and  consist  of  sandy, 
boulder-to-pebble  gravel  very  similar  to  that  in  the 
present-day  stream  channels.  The  fan  deposits  contain 
a  limited  variety  of  rock  types  reflecting  the  type  of 
source  material  available  in  the  separate  canyons. 

Older  alluvial  fan  deposits.  In  the  eastern  part  of 
the  area,  older  apparently  inactive  alluvial  fans  have 
been  differentiated  from  the  older  alluvium.  The  com- 
position of  these  fans  is  somewhat  different  from  most 
of  the  older  alluvium.  Clasts  of  dioritic  rocks  are  very 
abundant,  and  in  places  these  fans  are  nearly  mono- 
lithologic.

Terrace  gravel.  Most  of  the  terrace  deposits  are 
unconsolidated  to  poorly  consolidated,  fluviatile, 
l)(nildcr\-.  pebblc-to-cobbic  gravel,  and  fine  to  coarse 
sand.  Thc&gt;-  occur  at  widely  varying  elevations  and 
have  been  differentiated  from  areas  of  older  alluvium. 
In  one  location,  just  south  of  the  Lakeview  Terrace 
Sanitarium,  there  are  three  superposed  levels  of  ter- 
race deposits,  probably  closely  related  to  previous 
faulting.  Some  terrace  deposits  along  the  Sunland 
fault  appear  to  be  displaced  by  fault  scarps  visible  on 
air  photos,  and  near  I.ittle  Tujunga  Canyon  some  of 
these  are  shown  as  hypothetical  faults  on  the  geologic 
map  (plate  2). 

Alluvhn)!.  The  stream  channels  and  active  flood 
plains  of  Big  Tujunga  Wash,  Tujunga  Valley,  and 
Little  Tujunga  Canyon  contain  sandy,  pebble-to- 
boulder  gravel.  The  clasts  are  well  rounded  and  are 
mostly  derived  from  the  various  basement  rocks  pres- 
ent in  the  areas  drained.  Some  very  large  boulders, 
old  bridge  debris,  and  pieces  of  culvert  in  Tujunga 
Valley  indicate  the  torrential  nature  of  occasional 
floods. 

STRUCTURE 
Introduction 

The  surface  breaks  formed  along  the  Lakeview 
fault  at  the  time  of  the  earthquake  are  prima  facie 
evidence  of  its  existence.  The  equally  important  geo- 
logical evidence  of  major  thnisting  in  this  area  is 
discussed  in  this  section.  The  portion  of  the  Lake- 
view  fault  that  had  been  mapped  prior  to  the  earth- 
quake moved  again  during  this  earthquake.  Surface 
faulting  occurred  in  many  places  where  no  faults  had 
been  mapped  before,  and  the  near-continuity  of  some 
of  these  breaks  permits  a  four-fold  extension  of  the 
known  length  of  the  Lakeview  fault. 

Other  geologic  features,  now  exposed  by  landslid- 
ing  and  therefore  more  easily  recognized  than  before 
the  earthquake,  have  provided  a  better  opportunity 
to  interpret  the  geologic  structure  than  was  pre- 
viously possible.  .Most  earlier  work  was  done  at  scales 
designed  to  yield  a  regional  understanding  of  the 
geology  of  much  larger  areas  than  that  affected  by 
movement  on  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone. 

Three  major  faults  are  discussed  here  (which  in- 
cludes references  to  previous  work):  the  Lakeview 
fault,  the  Wild  wood  fault  (here  considered  part  of 
the  Lakeview  fault),  and  the  Sunland  fault.  Move- 
ment also  occurred  on  the  east  end  of  the  Tujunga 
fault  segment;  the  structure  of  this  area  is  discussed 
in  the  section  on  the  Lakeview  fault.  For  a  more  com- 
plete description  of  the  Tujunga  fault  segment,  see 
Barrows  (this  Bulletin). 

Lakeview  Fault 

The  Lakeview  fault,  as  considered  in  this  report, 
is  a  large  thrust  fault  along  which  surface  faulting 
occurred  from  Kagel  Canyon  to  Big  Tujunga  Can- 
yon. It  was  believed,  for  a  time,  that  a  series  of  dis- 
connected scarps  in  several  canyons  was  the  only 
expression  of  faulting  visible  in  this  area  and  that  any 
possible  movement  in  the  adjacent  hills  was  masked 
by  landslides  (Kahle  and  others,  1971,  p.  75;  Kamb 


and  others,  1971,  p.  49;  U.  S.  Geological  Survey, 
1971,  p.  71).  Very  detailed  mapping  of  the  surface 
breaks  in  the  hills  revealed  a  surprising  degree  of 
continuity;  and,  though  irregular  and  occasionally 
difficult  to  follow,  when  combined  with  the  strati- 
graphic  and  structural  evidence,  the  fault  can  be 
traced  with  confidence. 

The  Lakeview  fault  can  be  divided  into  t\vo  sec- 
tions which  have  very  different  characteristics.  Be- 
tween Kagel  Canyon  and  the  alluvium  of  Tujunga 
Valley,  the  trace  is  sinuous  and  irregular  and  meas- 
ures 6.8  km  (4.2  miles)  along  the  trace  with  a  straight- 
line  distance  of  4.6  km  (2.8  miles)  from  one  end  to 
the  other.  It  parallels  the  front  of  the  hills  and  is 
located  an  average  of  0.4  km  (!4  mile)  north  of  and 
up  slope  from  the  base  of  the  hills.  The  difference  be- 
tween the  actual  length  of  the  trace  and  the  straight- 
line  distance  is  more  than  2  km  (1!4  miles)  and  is 
due  to  the  low  angle  of  dip  of  the  fault  plane  inter- 
secting the  irregular  topography.  Eastward  from  the 
vicinit&gt;-  of  the  Lakeview  Terrace  Sanitarium,  the 
trace  is  more  nearly  linear  through  the  alluvium  of 
Tujunga  Valley  and  Big  Tujunga  Wash  and  can  be 
followed  as  far  as  the  north  side  of  Bill  Lane  Camp 
(138),  a  linear  distance  of  2.3  km  (1.4  miles).  The 
average  dip  of  the  fault  in  the  foothill  section  is  25° 
±  10°  N.,  but  to  the  east  it  steepens  to  as  much  as 
65°  N. 

Several  kinds  of  evidence  have  been  found  which 
substantiate  movement  on  the  Lakeview  fault.  The 
trace  in  the  hills  is  nearly  continuous;  and  surface  dis- 
placement, where  visible,  is  consistent  on  both  ridge 
tops  and  in  the  alluvium  of  the  canyon  bottoms — in- 
variably up  on  the  north.  In  Tujunga  Valley,  the 
trace  is  prominent  and  distinct,  cutting  both  recent 
and  older  alluvium.  Characteristic  landslides,  restricted 
to  the  trace,  occur  on  many  hillsides  bet^veen  Little 
Tujunga  Canyon  and  the  Lakeview  Terrace  Sani- 
tarium. Shale  of  the  Modelo  Formation,  which  over- 
lies the  thrust,  was  moved  outward  on  the  slope 
enough  to  drop  away  as  rockfalls  and  small  land- 
slides. Debris  and  dust  have  accumulated  on  the  slopes 
below  these  breaks,  simulating  "skin-type"  slides  or 
thin  soil  failures.  Commonly,  the  slope  below  the 
break  is  nearly  undisturbed,  except  for  flattened 
brush  and  cones  of  loose  debris.  In  some  places,  ma- 
terial both  above  and  below  the  thrust  plane  has 
fallen,  providing  excellent  exposures  of  the  Modelo- 
"thrust  sequence"  fault  contact. 

The  "thrust  sequence"  occurs  below  the  fault 
plane,  in  one  form  or  another  nearly  everywhere,  ex- 
cept in  the  alluvium  of  Tujunga  Valley.  The  breccia 
unit  is  very  thin  or  missing  in  many  places  and  could 
onl\-  be  shown  diagrammatically  on  the  map  (plate 
2).  Weathering  since  the  earthquake  has  changed  the 
appearance  of  the  breccia  unit  and  the  shale  above 
the  fault  plane.  The  color  contrast  has  been  enhanced 
— the  shale  has  turned  dark  brown;  and  the  breccia, 
nearly  white  or  light  gray.  The  other  units  of  the 
"thrust  sequence"  are  also  well  exposed  in  many  of 
the  slides  but  are  little  changed,  except  for  the  re- 
moval of  dust  by  wind  and  rain.

Between  Oliver  Canyon  and  Schwartz  Canyon, 
the  dip  of  the  fault,  inferred  from  the  trace,  is  20°- 
30°  N.  in  the  canyon  bottoms.  It  changes  gradually  to 
nearly  horizontal  farther  south  until,  near  its  southern- 
most extent  (131),  it  dips  approximately  10°  S.  The 
older  terrace  gravel  of  the  thrust  sequence  in  Oliver 
Canyon  dips  10°-15°  S.  at  the  front  of  the  hills  and 
10°  N.  beneath  the  trace  near  where  it  crosses  the  can- 
yon bottom.  This  apparent  "anticlinal"  warp  and  the 
corresponding  warp  in  the  thrust  surface  suggest 
penecontemporaneous  deformation  of  the  thrust  and 
the  rocks  under  the  thrust. 

Remnants  of  terrace  deposits,  25  m  (80  feet)  or 
more  above  the  present  stream  level,  are  present  from 
the  Lakeview  Terrace  Sanitarium  to  the  mouth  of 
Akens  Canyon,  all  at  about  the  same  elevation.  They 
begin  at  the  point  where  the  fault  leaves  the  hills  and 
are  north  of  the  present  fault  scarp.  It  seems  likely 
that  the\'  reflect  previous  episodes  of  activity  on  the 
Lakeview  fault.  The  bluffs  along  Tujunga  Valley 
probably  represent  a  fault-line  scarp;  the  terraces  have 
been  eroded  northward  and  away  from  the  fault  in 
the  alluvium  to  form  the  present  cliffs.  This  area  has 
been  elevated  so  rapidly  that  Ebey  Canyon  and  sev- 
eral small  can&gt;'ons  which  cut  through  the  terrace  de- 
posits have  a  much  steeper  gradient  where  they  enter 
Tujunga  Valley.  Their  courses  are  similar  to  hanging 
valleys. 

Erosion  in  several  canyons  has  dissected  the  ter- 
race deposits,  but  the  terrace  surfaces  that  remain  are 
reasonably  level.  .Many  houses  have  been  built  here, 
but  none  was  so  badly  damaged  that  it  required  demo- 
lition. 

Rocks  of  the  thrust  sequence  thin  and  may  disap- 
pear east  of  the  Lakeview  Terrace  Sanitarium.  Two 
fault  traces  could  be  mapped  in  the  alluvium  of  Tu- 
junga Valley.  These  traces  merge  to  one  about  400  m 
(1300  feet)  east  (135)  of  where  they  first  become 
visible.  This  suggests  that  rocks  of  the  thrust  sequence 
may  pinch  out  beneath  the  surface  in  Tujunga  Valley. 

The  evidence  for  previous  large-scale  displace- 
ment on  the  Lakeview  fault  is  overwhelming.  A  442  m 
(1450  feet)  cumulative  horizontal  component  of 
thrusting  (heave)  was  measured  from  the  ridge  be- 
tween Oliver  Canyon  and  Schwartz  Canyon  to  the 
point  where  the  scarp  crosses  Sch^\■artz  Canyon.  Shale 
of  the  Modelo  Formation  has  been  thrust  southward 
over  units  of  the  "thrust  sequence."  This  horizontal 
component  may  be  extended  30  m  (100  feet)  from 
drill  hole  data  which  indicates  shale  of  the  Modelo 
Formation  over  gravel  at  a  depth  of  7  m  (23  feet) 
about  18  m  (60  feet)  north  of  the  fault  trace  in 
Schwartz  Canyon  (Proctor  and  others,  1972).  The  to- 
tal heave  measured  is  475  m  (1550  feet).  The  greatest 
vertical  component  measured  (throw)  was  about  55  m 
(180  feet)  from  the  fault  trace  on  tlie  ridge  west  of 
Oliver  Canyon  (130)  to  the  canyon  bottom;  therefore, 
the  minimum  figure  for  displacement  on  the  Lakeview 
fault  is  approximately  equal  to  the  heave. 

The  age  of  the  rocks  in  the  "thrust  sequence"  is 
inferred  from  their  affinit\'  to  other  similar  rocks  in 
the  area.  Bonilla  (in  press)  found  evidence  allowing 
him  to  date  tentatively  a  previous  episode  of  faulting 


on  a  fault  in  Lopez  Canyon  which  also  moved  in  this 
earthquake.  He  suggests  a  recurrence  interval  of  200 
years  for  such  events.  If  we  accept  this  figure  and 
postulate  a  slip  of  150  cm  (5.0  feet)  on  the  Lakeview 
fault  for  each  previous  event,  the  time  needed  to  ac- 
cumulate 475  m  (1550  feet)  of  movement  would  be 
about  60,000  years.  This  may  be  close  to  the  age  of 
the  base  of  the  alluvium-breccia  unit  of  the  "thrust 
sequence."  The  older  terrace  gravel  unit  would  be 
much  older  than  that  since  it  had  to  be  deposited  be- 
fore movement  on  the  fault  began  to  influence  the 
accumulation  of  the  alluvium-breccia  unit.  Both  the 
breccia  unit  and  alluvium-breccia  unit,  therefore,  ap- 
pear to  be  timc-transgressive,  decreasing  in  age  ver- 
tically and  to  the  south. 

The  Lakevie\\-  fault  segment  and  the  Tujunga 
fault  segment  are  quasi-imbricate  and  overlap  linearly 
for  about  2  km  (1%  miles)  between  Kagel  Canyon 
and  Cassara  Canyon.  This  accounts  for  the  double 
scarp  in  Little  Tujunga  Canyon.  Displacements  de- 
crease and  appear  to  die  out  on  the  west  end  of  the 
Lakeview  fault  and  on  the  east  end  of  the  Tujunga 
fault.  The  two  segments  do  not  join.  The  faults,  \\hich 
are  about  350  m  (1150  feet)  apart,  both  dip  north.  A 
sequence  of  older,  inactive,  imbricate  thrust  faults 
has  been  tentativeK-  mapped  on  the  hill  east  of  Little 
Tujunga  Canyon,  suggesting  that  the  imbricate  rela- 
tionship of  the  Lakeview  fault  and  the  Tujunga  fault 
has  persisted  in  this  area  since  its  inception.  Thrust 
faults  are  commonly  mapped  as  more  than  one  anas- 
tomosing trace,  but  the  evidence  above  suggests  that 
an  en  echelon  imbricate  pattern  may  be  common  and 
may  persist  for  long  periods  of  geologic  time. 

Other  imbricate,  probably  sympathetic,  move- 
ment has  occurred  within  the  "thrust  sequence." 
Breaks,  with  a  vertical  component  of  displacement 
an  order  of  magnitude  less  than  those  on  the  main 
trace,  occurred  between  the  older  terrace  gravel  and 
alluvium-breccia  unit  east  of  Schwartz  Canyon  (133). 
Elsewhere,  similar  breaks  suggest  movement  along  the 
contact  between  the  older  terrace  gravel  and  the 
alluvium-breccia  unit,  but  they  could  not  be  traced 
for  any  great  distance. 

Surface  faulting  on  the  Lakeview  fault  coincided 
with  only  small  portions  of  the  faults  shown  on  pub- 
lished maps.  An  unpublished  geologic  map  (Jahns  and 
others,  1970,  plate  1),  b\-  the  Metropolitan  Water  Dis- 
trict of  Southern  California,  delineated  and  named 
nearly  2.0  km  (1  '4  miles)  of  the  Lake\icw  thrust  prior 
to  the  earthquake.  This  portion  of  the  thrust,  between 
Oliver  Can\on  (128)  and  the  Lakexicw  Terrace  Sani- 
tarium (134),  broke  essentially  where  it  had  been 
mapped,  with  minor  variations  (Proctor  and  others, 
1972).  .\lthough  this  was  compiled  at  a  scale  of 
1:12,000,  it  is  significant  that  the  geologic  interpreta- 
tion necessary  to  identify  this  as  a  thrust  fault  resulted 
from  mapping  done  at  a  scale  of  1:4,800  (R.  Crook, 
Jr.,  personal  communication,  1971). 

Oakcshott  (1958,  plate  1)  shows  a  high-angle  re- 
verse fault  (129)  dipping  60°  N.  between  rocks  of  the 
Modelo  Formation  and  terrace  gravel  now  recognized 
as  part  of  the  "thrust  sequence."  This  part  of  the 
Lakeview  fault  broke  during  the  earthquake,  but  the

movement  is  involved  in  a  reactivated  "tectonic  slide" 
portion  of  the  tlirust  which  will  he  discussed  later.  A 
small  portion  of  a  fault  mapped  hy  Howell  (1949; 
1954)  corresponds  with  the  location  of  the  Lakevicw 
fault  in  this  same  area  (129).  He  projected  it  as  a  high- 
angle  fault,  from  here  across  Oliver  Canyon  at  ap- 
proximatel&gt;-  the  same  place  that  the  Lakevicw  fault 
broke;  but  he  then  extended  it  northeast  into  rocks  of 
the  Towsley/Pico  Formation. 

The  "Wildwood  fault"  was  first  named  by  How- 
ell (1949.  1954),  but  a  fault  with  the  same  general 
location  and  trend  w-as  shown  on  maps  bv  Kew  (1924, 
plate  1),  Hill  (1930),  and  Miller  (1934).  High-angle 
faults  have  been  shown  on  maps  by  various  authors 
through  a  saddle  on  the  ridge  east  of  Little  Tujunga 
Canvon  (119)  in  subparallel  directions  generally 
trending  X.  65°  W.  as  far  west  as  Kagel  Canyon  and 
easrvvar'd  to  Cassara  Canyon.  Beatie  (1958)  shows  a 
roughlv  coincident  fault  but  does  not  name  it.  Jahiis 
and"  others  (1970,  plate  1)  essentially  follow  Beatie 
and  Howell  and  call  it  the  "Wildwood  fault". 

The  "Wildwood"  fault  is  not  shown  on  plate  2 
because  it  was  located  onl\-  approximately  by  previous 
workers.  Moreover,  the  present  surface  breaks  indi- 
cate a  different  direction  and  a  much  different  char- 
acter to  the  faulting  here  than  that  of  the  faults 
mapped  previously.  The  Wildwood  fault  is  considered 
here  to  be  part  of  the  Lakeview  fault. 

The  Lakeview  fault  broke  through  the  saddle  on 
the  ridge  east  of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  as  a  low- 
angle  thrust  dipping  less  than  25°  N.  and  striking 
approximatelv  N.  75°  W.  subparallel  to  bedding. 
Legge  (1937!  plates  11  and  15)  and  Nolte  (1937,  p. 
25-26)  interpreted  crumpled  bedding  present  in  a 
saddle  (120)  just  east  of  this  location  (119)  as  a 
flexure  instead  of  a  fault.  The\'  projected  this  flexure 
on  the  same  trend  as  some  of  the  faults  mentioned 
above.  A  minor  fault  did  occur  in  this  saddle  (120) 
during  the  earthquake,  but  it  could  not  be  followed 
bevond  the  ridge  crest  more  than  a  few  feet.  These 
"flexed"  beds  arc  now  known  to  be  located  on  the 
upper  plate  of  the  thrust,  where  such  isoclinal  folding 
could  be  intense.  It  seems  to  be  more  reasonable  to 
interpret  these  aligned  saddles  as  the  locus  of  an  ac- 
tive flexure.  The  nature  of  the  faulting  and  folding 
interplay  here  mav  help  explain  some  of  the  disagree- 
ment bet\veen  different  maps  in  this  area. 

Sunland  Fault 

No  unequivocal  evidence  for  1971  movement  was 
seen  along  the  Sunland  fault,  a  high-angle  reverse 
fault;  but  ground  breakage,  shattered  ridges,  and  par- 
ticularl\-  landslides  and  rockfalls  north  of  the  eastern 
end  of  the  fault  suggest  the  possibilit&gt;'  of  minor  sym- 
pathetic movement  or  at  least  a  concentration  of 
severe  shaking  in  the  rocks  of  the  upper  plate.  Rocks 
of  the  basement  complex,  patches  of  the  Modelo  For- 
mation, and  basalt  of  the  Topanga  Formation  have 
been  thrust  over  the  Saugus  Formation  along  the  Sun- 
land fault.  The  geology  shj)wn  on  plate  2  in  the  vicin- 
ity of  the  Sunland  fault  was  compiled  from  Beatie 
(1958)  and  Oakeshott  (1937;  1958;  field  maps).  They 
have  adequately  described  the  feature,  and  the  writer 


has  supplemented  the  peology  by  air  photo  interpre- 
tation for  possible  evidence  of  faulting  between  Her- 
rcrcs  Ranch  and  Cold  Creek.  Sharp  (1934)  suggested 
an  interpretation  of  the  northwestern  end  of  the  Sun- 
land fault  similar  to  that  shown  on  plate  2  by  ex- 
rending  it  to  Cold  Creek. 

SURFACE  FAULTING  AND  SURFACE  EFFECTS 
General  Features 

It  frequently  is  difficult  to  distinguish  surface 
breaks  due  to  faulting  from  those  due  to  other  causes 
such  as  lurching,  differential  settling,  landsliding,  or 
shattering  of  the  soil  layer.  The  criteria  used  to  iden- 
tify surface  faulting  are  primarily  continuity,  amount 
of  displacement,  and  linearity  of  the  fractures,  as  well 
as  displacement  of  rock  units  or  fresh  movements 
along  bedding  planes.  Where  the  surface  evidence  is 
in  unconsolidated  material,  as  it  most  commonly  is, 
the  most  important  characteristics  arc  continuity  and 
the  amount  of  vertical  offset  combined  with  any  or 
all  of  the  other  criteria.  The  surface  faulting  present 
in  this  area  is  characterized  by  much  associated 
ground  cracking  which  is  too  dense  to  show  on  the 
map  (plate  3).  It  is  usually  clear  from  the  charac- 
teristic mole  tracks  and  the  displacement  which  series 
of  breaks  is  the  main  surface  fault. 

Surface  faulting  on  the  Lakeview  segment  of  the 
San  Fernando  fault  zone  can  be  traced  from  the  ridge 
just  west  of  Kagel  Canyon  to  the  hill  on  which  Bill 
Lane  Camp  is  located  east  of  Big  Tujunga  Wash.  The 
trace  is  nearly  continuous,  except  where  hidden  by 
old  landslides,  thick  accumulations  of  slope  wash,  or 
brush.  Until  sufficient  detailed  mapping  of  the  trace 
and  the  related  geology  had  been  done,  the  continuity 
of  the  Lakeview  fault  w-as  not  well  established  and 
its  imbricate  but  separate  relationship  with  the  Tu- 
junga fault  could  not  be  verified  (Barrows  and 
others,  1971;  Barrows,  this  Bulletin). 

Many  cracks  which  are  not  a  direct  result  of 
surface  faulting  are,  nevertheless,  closely  related  to 
fault  movement  and  are  discussed  with  the  descrip- 
tions of  surface  faulting.  Other  cracks  and  surface 
effects  are  discussed  separately. 

The  surface  breaks  and  other  surface  effects  were 
mapped  on  l:2400-scale  air  photos  flown  by  Ameri- 
can Aerial  Surveys,  Inc.,  on  Febniary  12,  1971,  and 
on  l:4800-scalc  air  photos  flown  along  Tujunga  Val- 
ley by  I.  K.  Curtis  Services  on  February  11,  1971. 
Some  of  the  rockfalls  and  landslides  shown  on  plate 
3  were  interpreted  from  other  air  photos  flo\\Ti  four 
months  later  (.Morton,  this  Bulletin)  which  were  also 
used  to  map  other  surface  effects  north  of  the  Lake- 
vie\\'  fault  area.  The  l:2400-scale  photos  are  barely 
adequate  for  recording  all  the  major  surface  effects. 
Surface  faults  arc  shown  on  the  geologic  map  (plate 
2)  in  red  and  on  the  surface  effects  map  (plate  3). 
Cracks,  landslides  resulting  from  the  earthquake,  and 
other  surface  effects  are  shown  only  on  plate  3. 

Detailed  Descriptions 

Ka^el  Cavyon  to  Little  TtiJTnit^a  Canyon.  Sur- 
face breaks  on  the  Lakeview  fault  could  not  be  traced 
beyond  the  ridge  top  west  of  Kagel  Canyon  where 
the  road  was  broken.  From  the  hillside  west  of  Kagel 


1974 


San  Fernando  Earthquake — Geology  and  Geophysics

Canyon,  the  fault  trace  is  nearly  continuous  eastward 
to  Little  Tujunga  Canyon.  The  vertical  component  of 
movement  increases  eastward  as  far  as  the  east  side 
of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  where  it  then  decreases 
rapidly  as  the  fault  scarp  disappears  in  landslide  debris 
near  the  base  of  the  hill.  There  are  some  cracks  be- 
tween the  base  of  the  hill  and  the  top  of  the  ridge 
east  of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon,  but  no  continuity 
could  be  established. 

Along  the  creek  bottom  in  Kagel  Canyon,  a 
fence  built  of  horizontal  redwood  boards  bolted  to- 
gether at  their  ends  appeared  to  be  displaced  verti- 
cally 25  cm  (10  inches).  Weathering  marks  on  the 
partially  rotated  horizontal  members  of  the  fence  al- 
lowed a  reconstruction  of  its  pre-earthquake  position 
and  indicated  that  one  span  had  been  built  over  a 
pre-existing  sharp  change  in  ground  level  at  the  point 
where  the  fault  broke.  This  suggests  that  a  previous 
scarp  may  have  been  present  here  and  that  the  ap- 
parent vertical  displacement  was  less  in  this  event  than 
could  be  measured  on  the  ground. 

In  a  small  gully  crossing  the  trace  of  the  Lakeview 
fault  west  of  the  road  in  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  (116), 
a  small  slide  has  exposed  shale  of  the  Modelo  Forma- 
tion lying  on  top  of  unconsolidated  bouldery  cobble 
gravel  (photo  1).  These  units  are  in  fault  contact;  and, 
although  the  fault  moved  in  this  earthquake,  it  did  not 
move  an  amount  sufficient  to  account  for  the  total 
thrust  component  of  at  least  3.0-4.5  m  (10-15  feet) 
which  can  be  measured  here. 

Little  Tujimga  Canyon  to  Cassara  CaJiyon.  A  well- 
defined  surface  break,  with  a  vertical  component  of 
25  cm  (10  inches)  and  a  left-lateral  component  of 
about  20  cm  (8  inches),  occurred  on  the  first  ridge 
top  east  of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon.  From  here  to 
Cassara  Canyon,  the  trace  is  nearly  continuous  except 
where  obscured  by  slope  wash  and  old  landslide  debris 
on  the  hillside  west  of  Cassara  Canyon.  The  surface 
break  is  marked  by  numerous  landslides  triggered  di- 
rectly by  movement  of  the  Lakeview  fault,  which  help 
to  identify  the  fault  and  to  expose  the  rocks  involved. 

The  fault  broke  across  the  top  of  the  ridge  west 
of  Cassara  Canyon;  however,  it  broke  north  of  where 
it  would  be  expected  to  break,  judging  by  the  mapped 
geology  (121).  Rocks  of  the  Modelo  Formation  are  in 
fault  contact  above  rocks  of  the  "thrust  sequence" 
around  the  nose  of  the  ridge  76  m  (250  feet)  south 
of  the  present  breaks.  Little,  if  any,  movement  oc- 
curred along  this  part  of  the  fault  contact,  which  can 
be  followed  along  both  sides  of  the  hill  to  where  it 
merges  with  the  1971  fault  trace.  From  this  ridge  west- 
ward, the  trace  separates  similar  shale  beds  of  the 
Modelo  Formation  and  trends  subparallel  to  the  bed- 
ding. This  contact  appears  to  merge  with  parts  of  the 
inactive  imbricate  fault  sequence  discussed  earlier 
(plate  2). 

Minor  breaks  with  the  north  side  down  occurred 
along  bedding  planes  of  the  Modelo  Formation  in 
several  places  just  north  of  the  main  surface  fault  but 
could  not  be  followed  more  than  a  few  tens  of  feet. 
These  appear  to  be  an  expression  of  over-all  thrusting 
forces,  perhaps  due  to  irregularities  of  the  thrust  plane 
or  relaxation  of  the  strain  when  the  fault  moved.  Sim- 
ilar faults  occurred  north  of  the  Sylmar  fault  segment

near  the  Highland  Sanitarium  (85)  (Weber,  this  Bulle- 
tin) and  elsewhere. 

In  the  prominent  saddle  (123)  north  of  the  large 
hill  between  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  and  Cassara  Can- 
yon near  the  contact  of  the  Modelo  Formation  and  the 
Towsle\VPico  Formation,  large  en  echelon  breaks 
trending  northeast  suggest  a  left-oblique-normal  to 
normal  sense  of  movement  with  the  northwest  side 
down  (photo  2).  Some  ambiguity  exists  here  between 
measured  slip  direction  and  calculated  slip  direction 
which  ranges  from  approximately  S.  88°  W.  to  N. 
45°  W.  These  slip  directions  diverge  toward  both  ends 
of  the  breaks.  These  faults  cut  bedrock  of  diverse 
textures  as  well  as  soil.  They  cross  the  ridge  at  an 
acute  angle  \\ith  the  downslope  side  up  on  the  east 
side  of  the  ridge  and  the  downslope  side  down  on  the 
west  side  of  the  ridge.  The&gt;-  are  nearly  normal  to 
bedding  and  appear  to  have  a  large  lateral  component 
of  movement,  all  of  which  suggests  a  tectonic  origin. 
A  large  extensional  component  of  movement,  the 
limited  linear  extent  of  the  cracks,  and  their  location 
near  the  heads  of  two  large  pre-existing  landslides 
suggest  a  landslide  origin.  The  writer  favors  the  tec- 
tonic rather  than  landslide  alternative,  recognizing  that 
a  significant  interrelationship  between  the  two  prob- 
ably exists.  Similar  conditions  may  have  influenced  the 
formation  of  the  other  large  landslides  present  along 
the  contact  between  the  .Modelo  Formation  and  the 
Tow  sley/Pico  Formation. 

Other  breaks  occur  on  the  ridges  north  and  west 
of  the  head  of  Cassara  Canyon  (124).  Most  of  these 
displaced  bedrock  or  thin  soil  but,  unfortunately,  have 
been  obliterated  by  fire-break  maintenance  work. 
Parts  of  a  few  surface  breaks  are  still  visible  adjacent 
to  the  firebreaks.  The  two  with  8  cm  (3  inches)  of 
displacement  (see  plate  3)  do  not  appear  to  be  land- 
slide related  and  might  be  related  to  the  break  to  the 
south  (123),  but  no  continuity  can  be  established.  The 
one  with  12  cm  (4.7  inches)  of  displacement  crosses 
the  ridge  at  an  angle  to  bedding,  and  the  rest  seem  to 
be  due  to  displacement  along  bedding  planes.  Those

with  18,  10,  and  4  cm  (7,  4,  and  1.5  inches)  of  dis- 
placement also  parallel  bedding;  but  their  origin  may 
be  related  to  a  landslide  on  the  north  side  of  the  ridge 
(see  plate  2),  although  they  do  not  seem  to  parallel 
the  landslide  scarp. 

Some  movement  occurred  along  the  base  of  the 
hills  on  the  east  end  of  the  Tujunga  fault  segment,  cast 
of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon;  but  it  was  irregular  and 
discontinuous.  Breaks,  roughly  aligned  and  mostly 
compressional,  are  visible  across  several  of  the  streets 
near  the  base  of  the  hills.  Breaks  could  not  be  found 
in  the  house  lots  between  the  streets  except  west  of 
the  end  of  Christy  Avenue  where  a  small  mole  track 
crossed  two  lawns.  East  of  Christ&gt;'  Avenue,  no  evi- 
dence of  faulting  was  found  although  some  minor 
cracks  did  occur  in  a  few  driveways  farther  on. 

Cassava  Canyon  to  Oliver  Canyon.  The  trace  of 
the  Lakeview  fault  between  Cassara  Canyon  and  Oli- 
ver Canyon  is  complex  and  difficult  to  delineate.  Some 
portions  have  moved  as  imbricate  plates.  One  area  ap- 
pears to  be  crossed  by  a  series  of  tear  faults,  and  the 
trace  in  other  places  is  discontinuous  or  masked  by 
slope  wash. 

The  hillside  east  of  Cassara  Canyon  is  partly  cov- 
ered b\-  thick  slope  wash  or  old  landslide  debris  mak- 
ing it  difficult  to  identif\-  the  main  trace  here.  Discon- 
tinuous cracks  and  disturbed  soil  can  he  followed 
about  half  wa\'  up  the  hill  where  a  good  scarp  is  visible 
crossing  a  small  ridge.  Shale  of  the  Modelo  Formation 
is  in  fault  contact  above  breccia  or  alluvium-breccia 
units  here,  bur  a  short  distance  on  up  the  hill  the  trace 
becomes  diffused  b\'  branching  or  by  forming  a  series 
of  discontinuous  northeast  trending  tension  cracks.  In 
places,  these  cracks  are  en  echelon,  indicating  a  large 
left-lateral  component  of  movement  and  a  vertical 
component  with  the  southeast  (downslopc)  side  up. 
These  tension  cracks  can  be  followed  intermittently 


ncarh-  to  the  top  of  the  hill  marked  1748  east  of  Cas- 
sara Canyon  (125).  Thc\-  are  believed,  by  the  writer, 
to  represent  the  surface  expression  of  a  zone  of  left- 
lateral  tear  faulting  which  crossed  the  hill  here  instead 
of  breaking  around  its  cast  side,  where  the  fault  con- 
tact between  the  Modelo  Formation  and  the  "thrust 
sequence"  can  be  mapped.  Xo  movement  occurred  on 
this  part  of  the  fault  contact  because  the  rocks  of  the 
Modelo  Formation  w  hich  did  move  in  the  next  canyon 
to  the  north  (126)  are  not  continuous  across  the  gap 
of  this  canyon  and  hence  could  not  push  the  rocks  of 
the  Modelo  Formation  on  the  cast  side  of  hill  1748 
(sec  plate  2).  Movement  on  this  inferred  tear  fault  has 
apparently  been  enough  to  cause  a  large  slump  fracture 
along  the  east-west  ridge  line  of  hill  1748.  .^n  old  slide 
or  patch  of  terrace  gravel  may  be  what  has  slumped; 
but  exposures  are  poor,  and  the  topographic  expression 
is  ambiguous. 

A  small  landslide  took  place  east  of  Cassara  Canyon 
(122)  between  the  first  of  August  1971  and  Septem- 
ber 14,  1971,  downslope  from  and  including  previ- 
ously mapped  tension  cracks,  possibly  related  to  the 
above-mentioned  tear  faulting.  The  slide  is  in  shale  of 
the  Modelo  Formation,  but  no  apparent  triggering 
mechanism  could  be  determined.  There  had  been  no 
recent  rain.  Why  the  slide  occurred  six  months  after 
the  earthquake  is  unknown,  but  it  is  important  to  real- 
ize that  slides  can  happen  long  after  an  earthquake. 

Movement  took  place  between  the  alluvium-brec- 
cia unit  and  the  older  terrace  gravel  unit  of  the  "thrust 
sequence"  east  of  Cassara  Canyon.  The  terrace  gravel 
is  thin  here  and  overlies  a  wedge  of  sandstone  and  shale 
of  the  Modelo  Formation.  This  movement  may  be  re- 
lated to  the  tear  faulting  inferred  in  this  area  or  could 
be  due  to  sympathetic  movement  accompanying  that 
on  the  main  thrust.

Distinct  scarps  are  visible  in  both  the  west  (126) 
and  east  branches  (and  on  the  hill  separating  these 
branches)  of  the  canyon  which  parallels  the  power 
line  between  Cassara  Canyon  and  Oliver  Canyon.  An 
80-cm  (31-inch)  vertical  component  was  measured  in 
the  alluvium  of  the  west  branch;  and  a  30-cm  (12- 
inch)  component  in  the  alluvium  of  the  cast  branch. 
In  small  slides  along  the  trace,  rocks  of  the  Modelo 
Formation  are  well  exposed  and  are  in  fault  contact 
upon  a  thin  breccia  unit  and  the  alluvium-breccia  unit 
of  the  "thrust  sequence". 

The  north-dipping  fault  trace,  on  the  hillside  east 
of  this  canyon,  is  truncated  by  south-dipping  cracks 
along  the  \\est  side  of  what  the  writer  believes  is  a 
tectonic  slide  (127).  This  slide  moved  in  previous 
earthquakes  (displacing  part  of  the  thrust)  and  was 
reactivated  in  the  1971  earthquake.  The  trace  which 
marks  the  scarp  of  this  slide  can  be  followed  from 
here  across  several  small  ridges  to  the  north-south 
ridge  west  of  Oliver  Canyon  (129). 

Vertical  displacement  as  large  as  160  cm  (63 
inches)  was  measured  on  the  central  part  of  this  arcuate 
scarp  which  curves  southward  on  its  eastern  end.  In 
this  vicinity,  the  scarp  crosses  a  ridge  and  then  runs 
parallel  to  it,  displacing  the  ridge  line  relative  to  the 
hillside  60  cm  (24  inches)  downward  on  the  west  side 
(uphill  side)  of  the  scarp.  Cracks  and  other  surface 
breaks  and  detailed  geologic  relationships  suggest  that 
this  slide  has  displaced  a  portion  of  the  thrust  fault 
which  is  now  part  of  the  slide,  but  is  still  identifiable 
and  partly  active.  The  thrust  plane  is  severely  warped 
within  the  bounds  of  the  slide,  but  rocks  of  the  Modelo 
Formation  are  still  in  fault  contact  with  rocks  of  the 
"thrust  sequence".  Attitudes  of  the  Modelo  Formation 
in  the  slide  are  irregular  and  complicated  by  internal 


minor  faulting  but,  in  general,  indicate  a  rotation  of 
the  slide  mass.  A'lovcment  along  the  displaced  thrust 
plane,  within  the  landslide  mass,  can  be  seen  at  several 
places  around  the  base  of  the  hill.  In  order  for  the 
tiirust  plane  to  be  displaced,  rocks  of  the  "thrust  se- 
quence" under  the  fault  must  also  be  involved  in  the 
slide.  However,  since  no  recent  movement  of  the  rocks 
below  the  displaced  thrust  plane  could  be  detected,  it 
is  likeh-  that  the  lower  parts  of  the  slide  ma\'  now  be 
inactive  and  that  present  movement  is  taking  place 
mosth'  on  the  displaced  thrust  plane. 

The  breaks  outlining  this  slide  are  considered 
tectonic  and  are  mapped  as  fault  breaks  because  they 
appear  to  be  the  direct  result  of  movement  on  the 
thrust  where  it  intersects  the  slide  plane.  A  road  cut 
on  the  west  margin  of  the  slide  exposes  conclusive 
evidence  for  repeated,  presumably  tectonic,  movement 
on  this  slide  plane  and/or  fault.  The  present  displace- 
ment, which  is  less  than  50  cm  (20  inches)  here,  oc- 
curred along  an  old  break  which  previousl\-  displaced 
shale  of  the  jModelo  Formation  at  least  l'/2-2  m  (5- 
6/2  feet)  down  on  the  south.  The  scarp  formed  by 
this  former  break  has  loose,  jumbled,  unbedded  sand 
and  shale  debris  deposited  downslope  from  it  on  top 
of  the  displaced  rocks  of  the  .Modelo  Formation.  The 
cracks  formed  in  this  earthquake  extend  on  down  the 
face  of  the  cut  and  displace  debris  and  sand  which  fill 
the  older  crack.  None  of  this  debris  is  fresh  enough  to 
have  been  deposited  since  the  earthquake.  The  east 
margin  of  the  slide  (129)  appears  to  displace  the  thrust 
plane,  and  a  lateral  component  of  movement  consistent 
■with  this  concept  can  be  measured  on  a  ridge  top  here. 

Along  the  hillside  west  of  Oliver  Canyon,  the  fault 
is  \\xll  exposed  by  small  slides  (130)  (photo  3),  and  a 
continuous  trace  is  visible.  A  scarp  with  a  I53-cm  (5- 
foot)  vertical  component  of  displacement  can  be  mea-

surcd  where  the  fault  crosses  the  alluvium  of  the  can- 
yon. The  road  in  the  canyon  bottom  was  displaced, 
and  a  barn  on  the  scarp  was  badly  damaged  (photo 
4).  The  fault  dips  about  30"  N.  here;  and  its  contact 
with  fluvial  gravel,  dipping  about  10'  N.,  is  visible  in 
a  slide  on  the  west  side  of  the  canvon. 

Oliver  Canyon  to  Sclm-nytz  Canyon.  Between  Oli- 
ver Canvon  and  Schwartz  CauNon,  the  fault  is  gcner- 
allv  a  single  easily  followed  mole-track  scarp  except 
M-here  landslides  have  exposed  the  rocks  involved 
(132).  It  is  a  less  prominent  trace  in  this  stretch,  com- 
pared to  some  other  areas,  but  is  still  distinct.  Where  it 
traverses  part  of  the  hillside  cast  of  Oliver  Canyon,  it 
is  either  hidden  by  slope  wash  or  did  not  move  enough 
to  form  surface  breaks.  This  is  also  true  a  short  dis- 
tance along  the  hillside  west  of  Schwartz  Canyon, 
close  to  \\  here  the  trace  crosses  the  alluvium. 

The  dip  of  the  fault  in  this  section  changes  from 
about  30°  N.  in  Oliver  Canyon  to  about  10°  S.  near 
the  distal  end  of  the  lobate  trace  (131).  This  warp 
of  the  fault  plane,  discussed  earlier,  appears  to  be  a  re- 
flection of  warping  in  the  undcrl&gt;-ing  rocks.  It  may 
also  be  partly  due  to  tlic  large  horizontal  component 
of  thrusting  here;  the  rocks  of  the  upper  plates  have 
been  pushed  down  the  front  of  the  hill  faster  than 
erosion  can  remove  them. 

The  ridge  ber^veen  Oliver  and  Schwartz  Canyons 
was  faulted  and  scvcrel&gt;-  cracked.  Large  tension  cracks 
formed  over  a  broad  area  of  the  hilltop,  part  of  which 
has  been  cultivated.  Bedrock  can  be  seen  in  many  of 
the  open  cracks;  and  a  soil  layer,  as  much  as  50  cm 
(1.6  feet)  thick,  has  been  exposed.  The  area  is  bounded 
on  the  east  and  west  sides  b&gt;-  long  continuous  north- 
east-trending cracks  considered  b\-  the  writer  to  be 
fault  breaks.  These  breaks  are  displaced  an  average  of 
50  cm  (1.6  feet)  vertically  upward  on  their  downhill 
sides.  The  fault  on  the  \\est  side,  \\hich  is  12  m  (40 


feet)  below  the  crest  of  the  ridge  along  its  central 
parr,  ascends  the  ridge  at  either  end.  This  fault  is 
superposed  on  a  pre-existing  bench  along  the  hillside 
which  was  presumably  formed  by  previous  faulting  in 
the  same  place  and  with  the  same  sense  of  movement 
(D.  H.  Radbruch,  personal  communication).  The 
fault  on  the  east  side  cuts  across  the  head  of  a  gully 
transecting  rocks  of  the  Modelo  Formation  normal  to 
the  strike  of  the  bedding.  The  area  between  these  two 
faults  is  laced  with  both  small  and  large  cracks,  many 
of  w  hicli  ma\-  also  be  faults  since  they  extend  into  the 
bedrock.  They  have  been  mapped  as  cracks  because 
thc\-  appear  to  be  caused  by  lateral  spreading  of  the 
wliole  area  between  the  bounding  faults.  Desiccation 
cracks  in  the  cultivated  field  appear  to  have  expanded 
\\ith  fresh  breakage  along  their  edges.  Some  of  the 
openings  appear  to  have  widened  farther  than  normal, 
which  also  suggests  spreading. 

Large  older  landslides  occur  on  both  sides  of  the 
ridge,  north  of  the  badl\-  cracked  area;  but  none  was 
reactivated  in  the  earthquake.  A  few  cracks  adjacent 
to  the  slide  scarp  on  the  A\est  side  of  the  hill  may  be 
related  to  consolidation  of  the  material  in  the  slide,  but 
no  significant  movement  occurred.  \  medium-sized 
rotational  slide,  unlike  the  "skin  slides"  which  occur 
along  the  fault,  formed  above  the  Lakevie\\-  fault  trace 
on  tiie  west  side  of  Schwartz  Canyon.  The  roe  of  this 
slide  coincides  with  the  fault  trace,  suggesting  that  it 
ma\-  have  been  triggered  by  movement  on  the  fault  as 
\veil  as  by  shaking.  This  may  be  a  reactivated  older 
slide,  hut  it  is  now  difficult  to  decide  this  without  pre- 
carthquake  data.

Canyon,  it  is  difficult  to  follow  the  scarp.  Midway 
along  the  hillside,  it  is  well  exposed  where  it  forms 
the  sole  of  a  landslide  which  extends  above  the  trace 
nearly  to  the  top  of  the  ridge.  The  fault  is  distinct 
where  it  crosses  the  ridge  east  of  Sch\\artz  Canyon, 
and  it  can  be  traced  with  confidence  as  far  as  the  small 
canyon  east  of  the  Lakevie\\'  Terrace  Sanitarium 
through  a  series  of  small  landslides  which  expose  the 
fault  contact. 

Landslides  along  this  portion  of  the  fault  trace 
deserve  special  mention  because  they  are  much  more 
common  here  and,  locally,  are  nearly  continuous 
along  the  trace.  All  are  atypicial  "skin  slides"  directly 
related  to  fault  movement.  The  contact  between  the 
Modelo  Formation  and  the  alluvium-breccia  and/or 
the  breccia  unit  of  the  "thrust  sequence"  is  well  ex- 
posed where  the  slides  occurred.  The  breccia  unit  is 
ver\'  thin  and  is  apparently  absent  in  some  places.  The 
amount  of  movement  on  the  thrust  does  not  seem  to 
be  an\'  greater  here  than  elsewhere,  but  the  steepness 
of  the  slopes  may  be  a  factor  which  controlled  the 
density  of  the  slides.  Beds  of  the  mixed  alluvium-breccia 
unit  are  commonly  in  direct  fault  contact  with  rocks 
of  the  Modelo  Formation  here.  The  mixed  alluvium- 
breccia  unit  becomes  thinner  toward  the  east. 

A  second  line  of  imbricate,  weaker  faulting,  men- 
tioned earlier,  can  be  traced  along  the  top  of  the  older 
terrace  gravel  unit  of  the  "thrust  sequence"  around 
the  nose  of  the  two  hills  between  Schwartz  Canyon 
and  the  Lakeview  Terrace  Sanitarium  (1.^3).  The 
scarp  here  is  less  distinct  than  that  of  the  main  fault, 
but  its  expression  is  nearly  continuous.  Small  land- 
slides occur  ver\-  close  to  the  fault  trace  both  above 
and  below  it  but  do  not  form  a  consistent  pattern 
along  the  trace  as  do  those  along  the  main  fault. 


The  soil  is  severel_\'  cracked  on  the  slopes  above, 
in  bet^\'een,  and  below  the  main  and  lesser  traces  of 
the  thrusting.  Patches  of  shattered  soil  are  abundant, 
and  some  of  the  cracks  have  a  "tipped-our\vard"  sense 
of  movement  on  them  (photo  6).  The  soil  cover  ap- 
pears to  have  been  shaken  so  severely  that,  instead  of 
slumping  on  the  hillside  as  would  be  expected  of  loose 
material  and  rotating  so  that  the  slope  of  the  original 
surface  is  less  steep  ("tipped-inward"),  blocks  of  soil 
seem  to  have  been  flung  outward  from  the  hillside 
and  to  have  rotated  so  that  the  slope  of  the  original 
surface    became    steeper     ("tipped-outward").    This

phenomenon  was  also  noticed  in  the  San  Francisco 
earthquake  of  1906.  Crandall  (Lawson,  1908,  p.  253) 
described  cracks  several  hundred  feet  long,  a  mile 
east  of  the  main  trace  of  the  San  Andreas  fault,  with 
several  inches  of  downthrow  on  the  uphill  side.  Much 
of  tiic  soil  and  perhaps  some  of  the  underl\ing  rock 
has  been  loosened  in  this  way.  During  periods  of  heavy 
rain,  sufficient  water  may  collect  in  these  cracks  to 
cause  serious  sliding  or  mudflow  problems  in  the  area. 
This  possibiiit\',  combined  with  the  fact  that  houses 
have  been  built  close  to  the  base  of  the  hills  here, 
should  be  cause  for  serious  concern  each  time  it  rains 
and  particularly  during  heavy  rains  (Morton,  this 
Bulletin). 

Lakevieiv  Terrace  Samtariimi  to  Bill  Lane  Camp. 
From  tiic  small  canyon  east  of  the  Lakcview  Terrace 
Sanitarium,  the  fault  trace  is  poorly  defined  or  hidden 
until  it  enters  the  alluvium  of  Tujunga  Valley.  It  ap- 
pears to  cross  a  terrace  deposit  cast  of  this  small  can- 
yon, but  the  evidence  is  equivocal  where  only  very 
small  mole  tracks  can  be  seen  on  the  surface  of  the 
terrace. 

The  fault  scarps  in  the  coarse  boulder)^  alluvium 
of  Tujunga  \'^alley  trend  subparallel  to  the  current 
stream  channel,  crossing  it  in  several  places  and  causing 
ponding  of  sediments  or  forming  short  reaches  with 
a  sharply  steepened  gradient.  The  scarps  cut  various 
kinds  of  alluvium,  such  as  soft  sand  deposits  (photo  7) 
(135),  gravel  deposits  (photo  8)  (136),  boulderly  flood 
channels,  areas  of  sparse  soil  accumulation  with  light 
vegetation,  bulldozer  cuts,  bridle  trails,  and  islands  of 
flood  debris.  \''arious  components  of  movement  were 
measured;  vertical  components  range  from  20  to  130 
cm  (8-51  inches)  and  left-lateral  components  range 
from  20  to  100  cm  (8-39  inches).  Some  evidence  was 
found  suggesting  a  moderate  compressional  compo- 


nent. This  may  account  for  the  commonly  sharp, 
well-defined  trace  and  for  the  steepness  of  the  scarp 
face,  close  to  the  angle  of  repose  for  loose,  dr\-,  granu- 
lar material.  Little  cracking  could  be  found  cxxept 
ver&gt;-  close  to  the  trace  (photo  9)  (135),  which  con- 
trasts sharply  with  the  area  adjacent  to  the  fault  trace 
in  the  hills  to  the  west. 

The  fault  trace  in  the  alluvium  of  Tujunga  Valley 
was  distinct  and  easily  followed  over  most  of  its  length 
shortl\'  after  the  earthquake.  Ver&gt;-  soon  after  it 
formed,  it  \\'as  modified  1)\-  flowing  \\ater  or  buried 
by  sediment  where  it  crossed  the  present  stream  chan- 
nel. In  the  rest  of  the  alluvium  of  the  flood  plain,  the 
scarps  were  still  well  defined  a  \car  after  being  formed 
although  wind  and  rain  have  modified  them  slightly 
and  horse  and  motorcycle  traffic  has  nearly  obliterated 
some  small  sections.  The  linearity  of  the  trace  and  an 
ambiguous  exposure  of  a  jumbled  but  partly  aligned 
zone  of  cobbles,  dipping  approximately  45°  N.  in 
trench  6,  suggests  a  steeper  dip  on  this  part  of  the 
fault  than  farther  west  along  the  Lakeview  fault. 

Very  rough  estimates  of  slip  were  made  at  several 
points  where  a  strong  left-lateral  component,  as  well 
as  a  \ertical  component,  could  be  measured  on  features 
displaced  by  the  fault  and  crossing  it  at  an  acute  angle; 
suggested  dips  are  greater  than  45°  N.  Near  the  mouth 
of  Ebey  Canyon,  a  dip  of  60°  N.  was  measured  on  a 
fresh  scarp  at  the  base  of  the  bluff  which  had  at  least 
100  cm  (39  inches)  of  reverse  dip-slip  movement  on 
it  (photo  10)  (137).  Slickensides  on  this  scarp  benveen 
rocks  of  the  Towsley/Pico  Formation  and  the  al- 
luvium of  Tujunga  Valley  formed  in  this  earthquake. 
Older  slickensides  would  presumably  have  been  oblit- 
erated when  the  alluvium  was  being  deposited.  The 
plunge  of  the  slickensides  is  nearly  coincident  with 
the  dip,  indicating  a  slip  direction  close  to  S.  30°  W.

A  slight  rotarion  of  the  slickensides  was  visible  (photo 
11)  (137),  suggesting  a  left-lateral  component  of  mo- 
tion as  the  fault  started  to  move  but  which  rapidly 
changed  to  dip-slip  movement.  Three  months  after 
the  earthquake,  this  evidence  had  been  nearly  obliter- 
ated by  caving  of  the  cliff  face  (photo  12)  (137). 
The  Lakeview  fault  scarp  crosses  Oro  Vista  Ave- 
nue and  displaces  the  road  100  cm  (39  inches)   left 


laterally  and  40  cm  (16  inches)  vertically  with  the 
north  side  up.  Ea.st  of  here,  the  fault  trace  swings  from 
an  east  trend  to  a  northeast  trend  and  disappears  in  an 
area  covered  by  fill.  It  reappears  along  the  north  side 
of  the  hill,  labeled  Bill  Lane  Camp  on  the  map,  as  a 
scarp  in  bedrock  separating  rocks  of  the  Towsley/Pico 
Formation  and  rocks  of  the  Alodelo  Formation  (138).

angle  has  been  offset  15  cm  (6  inches)  left  laterally. 
Because  of  the  angle  of  intersection  of  the  fault  trace 
and  the  fence,  the  amount  of  movement  on  the  fault 
required  to  form  that  much  offset  on  the  fence  would 


be  about  45  cm  (18  inches)  left  lateral.  No  measurable 
vertical  component  could  be  found,  and  the  fault  could 
not  be  followed  farther  than  this.  The  alluvium  of 
Big  Tujunga  Canyon  bct^xen  here  and  Count\'  Camp 
Fifteen  (141)  was  searched  carefully,  but  no  unam- 
biguous evidence  for  faulting  was  found.

southwesnvard  from  the  main  fault  trace.  These  are 
mapped  as  cracks  because  they  traverse  the  slope  above 
and  may  be  related  to  the  large  landslide  seen  on  this 
hill.  This  slide  was  not  activated  by  the  earthquake, 
but  much  of  the  loose  material  in  it  was  disrupted. 
In  line  with  these  cracks  and  at  the  south  base  of 
the  hill,  a  small  fault  scarp  was  detected  where  shale 
of  the  Modelo  Formation  had  been  thrust  25  cm  (10 
inches)  over  a  mixed  unit  of  alluvium  and  breccia  very 
similar  to  the  alluvium-breccia  unit  under  the  Lake- 
view  fault.  This  alluvium-breccia  mixture  overlies 
coarse,  boulder&gt;'  older  alluvium  which  does  not  re- 
semble the  older  terrace  gravel  of  the  "thrust  se- 
quence" except  for  being  fluvial  in  origin.  It  is  nearly 
monolithologic  alluvium  composed  of  boulders  and 
gravel  much  coarser  grained  and  with  many  more 
clasts  of  diorite  than  the  older  terrace  gravel  to  the 
west  or  the  gravel  of  Tujunga  \"alley.  It  is  probably 
an  old  terrace  deposit  and  has  been  mapped  as  older 
terrace  gravel. 

Other  Faults 

Minor  faults,  with  vertical  displacements  from  5 
to  35  cm  (2-14  inches)  but  of  limited  length,  were 
found  at  scattered  locations  north  of  the  Lakeview 
fault  area.  Because  this  area  was  covered  only  in  re- 
connaissance, it  is  safe  to  assume  that  a  more  thorough 
study  might  reveal  additional  faulting,  such  as  that 
found  in  the  area  north  of  the  Tujunga  fault  (Bar- 
rows, this  Bulletin,  and  plate  2). 

On  a  spur  of  Yerba  Buena  Ridge  (142),  several 
faults  and  associated  small  cracks  occurred  in  bedrock 
of  the  basement  complex.  They  cross  the  ridge  crest 
and  have  vertical  displacements  of  5-15  cm  (2-6 
inches)  with  the  south  or  do^^•nslope  side  up  where 
they  traverse  the  hillsides.  No  lithologic  controls 
could  be  found  to  explain  their  origin,  and  they  do 


not  appear  to  be  related  to  landsliding.  They  resemble 
similar  faults  and  cracks  on  Kagel  .Mountain  (49)  (see 
Barrows,  this  Bulletin). 

A  fault  which  occurs  partly  in  terrace  deposits 
and  partly  in  bedrock  in  the  upper  reaches  of  Doane 
Canyon  moved  upward  on  the  north  side  35  cm  (14 
inches).  This  fault  appears  to  separate  basalt  of  the 
Topanga  Formation  from  rocks  of  the  Modelo  Forma- 
tion near  its  eastern  end  but  does  not  correspond 
closely  with  the  geology  compiled  for  the  map  in  this 
area.  It  is  evident  from  the  geologic  map  (plate  2) 
that  this  break  is  close  to,  but  not  on,  one  of  the 
mapped  traces  of  the  Sunland  fault.  Sharp  (1934) 
shows  a  fault  in  this  area  corresponding  more  closely 
\\  ith  this  break  than  the  geology  compiled  for  plate  2. 

Minor  bedding-plane  faults  with  less  than  15  cm 
(6  inches)  of  reverse  movement  occur  in  the  area  west 
of  Big  Tujunga  Canyon  (139)  and  near  the  mouth  of 
Ebey  Canyon.  None  of  these  faults  appears  to  be  very 
long  but,  during  the  earthquake,  would  have  seriously 
damaged  any  structures  built  over  them. 

Other  Surface  EfFects 

Cracks  not  related  to  faulting.  Cracking,  which  is 
ubiquitous  along  the  main  fault  traces,  is  usually  but 
not  always  restricted  to  the  upper  plate  and  in  many 
places  extends  upslope  for  many  tens  of  feet.  Be- 
cause of  the  scale  of  plate  3,  most  of  these  minor 
cracks  cannot  be  shown.  The  areas  of  significant 
cracking  have  been  discussed  under  the  detailed  de- 
scriptions of  the  fault  breaks. 

The  natural  cutbanks  of  streams,  the  eroded  edges 
of  terrace  deposits,  and  the  steep  edges  of  some  ridges 
showed  many  cracks  and  slumps.  Many  of  these  ef- 
fects were  not  extensive  enough  to  be  shown  in  plate 
3.  Since  they  are  commonly  related  to  landslides  or 
rockfalls,  their  density  should  be  evident.

Some  cracks  crossed  Mr.  Glcason  Avenue,  just 
south  of  County  Camp  Fifteen  (141).  These  cracks, 
together  with  cracks  in  the  alluvium  along  the  west 
side  of  the  road  (140),  which  also  broke  a  water  line 
in  several  places,  suggest  possible  fault  movement;  but 
the  evidence  is  ambiguous. 

Man\'  prominent  cracks  and  other  effects  are  visi- 
ble in  the  terrace  deposits  and  the  soil  along  the  Sun- 
land  fault  west  of  Big  Tujunga  Canyon  (139).  These 
appear  to  be  due  mostly  to  severe  shaking.  The  bases 
of  many  of  the  isolated  patches  of  poorlv  consolidated 
terrace  gravel  appear  to  have  moved  enough  to  cause 
intermittent  cracking  in  the  soil  at  the  contact  with  the 
underl\-ing  Tcrtiar\-  rocks.  Large  boulders  are  very 
abundant  near  the  base  of  tlicsc  terrace  deposits  and 
ma\-  have  acted  as  "bearings,"  amplifying  the  shaking 
effects. 

Shattered  rid^e  tops.  A  \'ery  unusual  surface  ef- 
fect, largely  restricted  to  ridge  tops,  was  M'idcspread 
as  a  result  of  this  earthquake.  The  soil  on  literally 
hundreds  of  ridge  tops  throughout  the  cpiccntral  area 
\\'as  completely  sliatrcrcd,  prcsumabi\-  b\-  severe  shak- 
ing. Cobbic-sizc  clods  of  dr)-  soil  appear  to  have  been 
broken  loose  and  tossed  about,  in  some  places  being 
partially  disintegrated  and  occasionally  being  turned 
completely  upside  down. 

This  phenomenon  has  been  called  shattered  earth 
(Nason,  1971,  p.  97),  sliattcrcd  ridge  tops  (Kahle  and 
others,  1971;  Barrows  and  others,  1971),  and  shattered 
ridges  (Evans,  this  Bulletin).  This  sort  of  thing  has 
apparently  happened  in  other  earthquakes  but  has 
never  been  reported  over  so  large  an  area  (plate  3). 
Others  have  used  the  terms  "exploded  ridge"  and 
"plowed  ground"  to  describe  these  features.  Davis  and 
West  (this  Bulletin)  discuss  the  effects  of  topography 
on  ground  morion. 

Oldham  (1899,  p.  10),  in  his  report  on  the  great 
Indian  earthquake  of  1897,  quoted  a  report  by  A.  A. 
Howell  which  deserves  repeating:  ".  .  .  where  the  soil 
is  sand\'  and  the  surface  fairl\-  level,  the  ground  looks 
as  if  a  steam  plough  had  passed  over  it,  tearing  up  the 
turf  and  throwing  the  clods  in  every  direction,  some 
up  hill  and  some  down,  and  in  man\'  cases  turning 
the  sods  completely  o\cr,  so  that  only  the  roots  of 
the  grass  are  visible." 

R.  Crandall  (in  Lawson,  1908,  p.  253),  in  de- 
scribing the  effects  of  the  1906  earthquake  on  Cahill's 
Ridge  south  of  San  Francisco  said:  "In  an  area  of 
limestone,  a  small  patch  some  30  feet  in  diameter  was 
torn  up  as  rlio  it  had  been  plowed  and  iiarrowed,  and 
no  large  pieces  of  sod  were  left  intact."  He  also 
noticed  the  "tipped-outward"  appearance  of  peripheral 
cracks  (commonly  associated  with  shattered  ridge  tops 
in  the  San  Fernando  earthquake)  and  says:  "There 
was  a  slight  downthrow  on  the  uphill  side  to  be 
noticed  in  some  of  these  cracks,  which  eliminated  the 
possibilit&gt;'  tiiar  rhc\-  were  cracks  preparatory  to  land- 
sliding."  Bonilia,  in  describing  tiie  effects  of  the  San 
Francisco  earthquakes  of  March,  1957  (1959,  photo 
1),  shows  a  picture  of  very  similar  cracks  and  de- 
scribes them:  ".  .  .  as  though  an  explosion  had  been 
set  off  bencatii  it  .  .  ."  These  descriptions  could  as 
well  be  applied  to  the  shattered  ridge  tops  caused  by 
the  San  Fernando  earthquake. 


The  shattering  effect  seen  in  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  appears  to  be  restricted  to  ridge  tops  of 
various  widths  and  shapes,  albeit  relatively  narrow,  sug- 
gesting some  topographic  control;  but,  in  many  places, 
only  short  stretclies  of  long  uniform  ridges  were  af- 
fected. The  trend  of  the  ridges  whicii  shattered  seems 
to  be  random.  Lithologic  controls  appear  to  be  a 
strong  factor  also  (Barrows,  this  Bulletin).  In  one 
place,  near  San  Fernando  pass,  shattering  was  seen 
with  no  difference  in  appearance  in  both  soil  cover 
and  adjacent  bedrock.  In  the  area  between  Little  Tu- 
junga Canyon  and  Big  Tujunga  Canyon,  most  of  the 
shattering  seen  was  restricted  to  unconsolidated  ter- 
race gravel,  to  soft  sandstone  and  shale  beds  in  the 
upper  part  of  the  TowsIe\'/Pico  Formation,  or  to  a 
narrow  zone  in  the  Saugus  Formation  about  460  m 
(1500  feet)  south  of  the  Sunland  fault.  Shattered  ridge 
tops  were  also  common  near  the  surface  faults. 

Landslides  and  rockfalls.  Morton  (this  Bulletin) 
has  described  tiie  character  and  distribution  of  land- 
slides and  rockfalls  in  the  whole  epicentral  tract 
(shown  in  red  on  plate  3).  The  landslides  along  the 
Lakevicw  fault  have  been  described.  There  seems  to 
be  a  local  abundance  of  landslides  and  rockfalls  in  the 
area  north  of  and  adjacent  to  the  Sunland  fault,  par- 
ticularl\'  near  its  eastern  end.  This  may  represent  more 
severe  shaking  in  the  rocks  of  the  upper  plate  of  the 
Sunland  fault,  perhaps  in  response  to  slight  movement 
on  it  or  to  the  more  broken  character  common  to 
rocks  in  the  upper  plate  of  a  thrust. 

Fill  failure.  Failure  in  artificial  fill  was  widespread. 
Fills,  particularly  along  secondary  and  fire  access 
roads  or  where  ovcrsteepened  by  erosion,  commonly 
were  affected  b&gt;^  the  earthquake.  Roadcuts  commonly 
failed  along  their  upper  edges.  Controlled  artificial  fill 
fared  somewhat  better,  but  it  was  not  uncommon  to 
see  cracking  and  slumping  of  the  angular  edges. 
Structures  set  back  far  enough  from  the  edge  were  un- 
affected in  some  cases.  Fills  in  other  areas  responded 
poorl\-  (Weber;  Barrows;  Saul;  this  Bulletin).  This 
kind  of  cracking  is  not  indicated  on  plate  3  because, 
in  this  study,  it  was  not  possible  to  evaluate  the  vary- 
ing degrees  of  engineering  control  employed. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Movement,  mainly  on  the  San  Fernando  fault 
zone,  caused  tiie  Fcbruarv  9  earthquake.  Prominent 
scarps  were  formed  wiiich  made  it  possible  to  deline- 
ate several  formcrh'  unrecognized  faults.  The  displace- 
ment on  the  Lakevicw  fault  segment  was  as  large  as 
that  on  the  other  segments  of  the  San  Fernando  fault 
zone;  but,  except  for  the  scarps  in  Tujunga  Valley, 
the  trace  was  much  less  evident.  Its  continuit)-  was 
not  recognized  for  a  time  because  the  evidence  was 
hidden  by  a  profusion  of  landslides.  Detailed  mapping 
rcxcaled  a  pattern  of  displacement  consistent  with 
the  geological  units  and  their  relationships  under  the 
fault.  .\  distinctive  sequence  of  rocks  is  critical  to 
the  interpretation  of  active  thrusting  and,  along  with 
the  heave  measured  on  the  fault,  supplies  evidence 
that  the  fault  probablv  has  been  active  for  the  last 
60,000  plus  \cars. 

The  Lakcview  fault  is  imbricate  and  consists  of 
several   planes  between   Kagel   Canyon   and   Cassara

Canyon.  This  evidence  suggests  that  connected,  anas- 
tomosing thrust  faults,  as  commonly  mapped,  may  be 
an  oversimplification. 

Surface  faulting  is  confined  to  a  zone  ranging 
from  about  3  m  (10  feet)  to  as  wide  as  475  m  (1550 
feet)  because  of  the  sinuous  nature  of  the  gently 
dipping  trace.  Significant  but  secondat}-  faulting  also 
occurred  across  a  zone  3  to  5  km  (2  to  3  miles)  wide 
north  of  the  main  trace. 

With  enough  detailed  geologic  mapping,  even 
without  such  aids  as  trenching  and  drilling,  there  is  a 
very  good  chance  that  much  of  the  Lakeview  fault 
segment  could  have  been  identified  before  the  earth- 
quake. It  is  also  very  likely  that  no  amount  of  map- 
ping, drilling,  and  trenching  could  have  located  the 
places  where  secondary  faulting  took  place.  The  other 
surface  effects,  particularly  shattered  ridge  tops  and 


landslides,  were  even  more  widespread  and  would  be 
even  more  difficult  to  predict.  If  the  trace  of  a  fault 
is  well  know  n,  it  can  be  a\oidcd;  but  secondary  fault- 
ing and  the  other  surface  effects  can  be  just  as  devastat- 
ing to  any  structure  located  where  they  occur.  This 
has  serious  implications  for  an\-  attempts  to  zone  simi- 
lar areas  for  development  or  in  attempting  to  evaluate 
any  area  for  seismic  hazard. 

The  writer  has  attempted  to  demonstrate  the 
value  of  geologic  mappings  in  delineating  an  active 
fault.  It  is  always  helpful,  of  course,  to  know  that  a 
fault  is  active  before  one  attempts  to  prove  it.  Along 
the  Lakeview  fault,  the  geologic  evidence  for  late 
Holocene  thrusting  seems  compelling  enough  to  have 
raised  the  suspicion  that  the  Lakeview  fault  was  ca- 
pable of  renewed  movement,  even  without  the  proof 
of  a  magnitude  6.4  earthquake  accompanied  by  major 
surface  faulting.

The  willing  cooperation  and  assistance  of  many 
residents  in  the  area,  giving  both  time  and  informa- 
tion, is  gratefully  acknowledged.  Gordon  B.  Oake- 
shott  graciously  lent  his  very  valuable  field  maps 
(1:24,000  scale)  on  which  he  had  originally  mapped 
the  geology  for  his  bulletin  on  the  San  Fernando 
quadrangle  (1958).  Valuable  discussions  in  the  field 
with  many  staff  members  of  the  California  Division  of 
Mines  and  Geology,  with  Dorothy  Radbruch  of  the 
U.  S.  Geological  Survey,  and  with  Richard  Crook,  Jr., 
and  Mark  H.  McKeown  of  the  Metropolitan  Water 
District  of  Southern  California  were  very  helpful.  Ed 
Heath  and  Bob  Dickey  of  F.  Beach  Leighton  and 
Associates  assisted  in  logging  the  trenches  dug  by  the 
Division  in  the  area.  Examination  of  the  trenches  dug 
by  the  U.  S.  Geological  Survey,  at  the  invitation  of 
M.  G.  Bonilla,  proved  very  useful.  State  and  local 
agencies  cooperated  fully. 


CHAPTER  9 

Geologic  Effects  of  the  Son  Fernando  Earthquake 
in  the  Newhall-Saugus-Valencia-Solemint  Area 


by  James  R.  Evans  ' 


A  brief  survey  was  made  of  geologic  effects  and 
their  relation  to  major  damage  in  the  Newhali-Saugus- 
Valencia-Solemint  area  (see  figure  1)  in  the  first  seven 
days  after  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February 
9,  1971.  All  photos  used  in  this  report  were  taken 
during  that  period. 

jMost  earthquake  damage  can  be  related  in  a  broad 
way  to  the  four  geologic  environments  discussed  in 
this  article.  In  order  of  decreasing  economic  signifi- 
cance, these  are: 

1)  Ground  cracking  and  shaking  of  the  upper  Miocene 
and  lower  Pliocene  Towsley  Formation,  the  Pliocene  Pico 
Formation,  and  the  Pliocene  Sunshine  Ranch  Member  of 
the  Saugus  Formation. 

2)  Ground  shaking  of  graded  alluvial  covers  on  Quater- 
nary terrace  deposits.  Pliocene  and  lower  Pleistocene  Saugus 
Formation,    and    upper    Miocene    Mint    Canyon    Formation. 

3)  Ground  shaking  of  pre-Cretaceous  granitic,  anortho- 
sitic,   and   gabbroic    rocks    in   the   San   Gobriel   Mountains. 

4}   Ground  shaking   and   cracking   in   the  Saugus   Formation. 

GROUND  CRACKING  AND  SHAKING 
IN  PLIOCENE  FORMATIONS 

Damage  in  this  geologic  environment  was  cen- 
tered in  the  San  Fernando  Pass-Grapevine  Canyon 
area  north  of  the  Van  Norman  Reservoirs.  The  im- 
portance of  the  area  to  greater  Los  Angeles  cannot 
be  overemphasized.  Not  only  does  the  Los  Angeles 
City  Aqueduct  system  pass  though  here,  but  there 
are  distribution  tunnels  for  the  California  Water 
Project  (not  yet  in  operation)  and  the  Golden  State 
Freeway  with  overpasses  near  the  intersection  of  the 
Sierra  Highway  (Antelope  Valley  Freeway)  and  the 
Foothill  Freeway.  In  addition,  the  Southern  Pacific 
Railroad  line  and  tunnel  pass  beneath  the  freeway 
overpass  nervvork. 

All  of  these  major  structures  were  damaged  dur- 
ing the  earthquake.  Water  transport  was  stopped  in 
the  Los  Angeles  City  system  because  of  breaks  and 
cracks  in  lines.  The  very  high  Antelope  Valle&gt;'  Free- 
way overpass  collapsed  onto  the  Golden  State  Free- 
^•ay  about  100  feet  (30  m)  below  and  then  onto  the 
railroad  tracks  just  south  of  the  railroad  tunnel  en- 
trance (photo  1  and  California  Division  of  Highways 
[this  Bulletin]).  Rail  service  was  out  for  four  days, 
and  trains  -were  rerouted.  Normal  traffic  flow  on  the 
Golden  State  Freewa&gt;'  was  interrupted  for  a  few 
months,  until  temporar&gt;"  freeway  structures  could  be 
completed.  Freeway  bridge  and  overpass  structures 
had  not  been  rebuilt  as  of  January  1972.

The  types  of  geologic  failures  found  in  this  area 


1)   Slope  failure  by  shaking: 

a.  down  the  dip  of  beds  at  moderate  slope  angles. 

b.  across  the  dip  of  beds  at  steep  angles. 

c.  debris  falls  and  dry  debris  flows  on  steep  slopes. 

2}  Ground  cracking  in  soils  and  rocks,  locally  resulting  in 
shattered  ground  on  steep,  narrow  ridges  underlain  by  steeply 
dipping  weak  rocks. 

3)  Ground  rupture  (faulting?)  with  displacement  of  surface 
rocks. 

4)  Cracking  in  roads,  road  fills,  and  fills  adjacent  to  the 
Los  Angeles  City  Aqueduct  and  Golden  State  Freeway  struc- 
tures. 

Slope  Failure 

The  most  prominent  earthquake-triggered  land- 
slide in  the  area  was  along  a  ridge  about  2000  feet 
(600  m)  south  of  the  Sierra  Highway  intersection 
with  the  Golden  State  Freeway.  It  is  adjacent  to  a 
100-foot-high  (30  m)  cut  on  the  west  side  of  the  exist- 
ing freeway  system  and  about  125  feet  (38  m)  above 
it  (photo  2). 

In  plan,  the  slide  mass  is  about  750  feet  (227  m) 
long  in  a  northeast  direction  and  about  450  feet 
(136  m)  across.  The  mass  e.xtends  down  slope  about 
200  feet  (60  m)  from  the  ridge  top.  Because  of  the 
irregular  failure-surface  of  the  slide,  it  is  difficult  to 
determine  thickness  of  the  mass  without  trenching  or 
drilling.  If  an  average  thickness  figure  of  24  feet  is 
used,  there  were  about  900,000  cubic  feet  (225,000 
m^)  of  material  involved  in  the  failure.  This  is  prob- 
ably a  minimum  figure. 

Strong  vibration  caused  water-laden  beds  in  the 
Towsley  Formation  to  fail  along  and  across  bedding 
planes  and  to  lurch  out  and  down  slope  through  the 
(2:1)  cut.  The  To\\sley  Formation  here  is  composed 
of  interbeddcd  porous  brownish  sand\-  silt  and  grayish 
friable  fine-grained  sandstone.  Beds  strike  northwest 
and  dip  about  20°  northeast.  These  rocks  are  in- 
herently very  weak,  particularly  when  saturated  with 
water;  and  much  support  was  removed  when  the  free- 
way cut  was  made.  Consequently,  rocks  in  the  upper 
part  of  the  slope  could  not  stand  under  the  intense 
shaking.  Near  the  ridge  top,  blocks  of  rocks  10  to  15 
feet  (3  to  4.5  m)  across  and  10  feet  (3  ni)  or  higher 
broke  apart  and  slid  away  from  each  other  (photo  3). 

The  lower  part  of  the  mass  apparently  broke 
away  from  the  slope  across  bedding  planes,  lurched 
outward  through  the  cuts,  and  virtually  crumbled  and 
"flowed"  down  slope.

On  the  east  side  of  the  Golden  State  Freeway, 
just  soutli  of  its  intersection  with  the  Sierra  Highway, 
another  mass  of  Towsley  Formation  failed  through  a 
100-foot-high  (30  m)  cut  of  1 '/i :  1  ratio  (photo  4). 
This  failure  was  in  water-laden,  highly  fractured  silt- 
stone  and  sandstone  similar  to  the  beds  described 
above;  however,  there  were  significant  differences  be- 
tween these  failures.  In  this  second  slide,  the  cut  slope 
was  steeper  and  the  rock  mass  was  only  roughly  half 
as  large  in  plan  view;  however,  because  of  the  arcu- 
ate nature  of  the  slide  plane,  it  had  a  greater  average 
thickness.  Possibly  the  cubic  feet  were  nearly  the 
same,  but  drilling  would  be  needed  to  confirm  this. 
The  second  slide  mass  lurched  forward  but  did  not 
come  down  slope  more  than  several  \'ards.  This  mass 
failed  across  the  strike  of  beds  \\'hich  trend  east- 
northeast  and  dip  about  60^  north,  and  the  long  a.xis 
of  the  mass  trended  west-south\\est.  The  toe  of  the 
mass  largely  remained  buttressed  by  pre-existing  fill 
in  a  canyon  adjacent  to  the  south-southeast.  The  toe 
is  only  about  50  feet  (\5  m)  from  the  freeway;  in 
Januar\-  1972,  this  mass  still  posed  a  threat  to  traffic 
should  it  fail  after  heavy  rains  or  during  an  earth- 
quake. 


As  of  January  1972,  neither  of  these  two  slide 
areas  had  been  corrected.  Extensive  grading,  resulting 
in  a  lower  angle  for  the  cut  faces,  \\ill  be  necessary 
for  correction. 

A  large  debris-fall  occurred  on  the  hill  just  west  of 
the  portal  of  the  Los  Angeles  City  Aqueduct.  Here,  a 
ver\'  steep,  natural  slope  existed  on  fractured,  west- 
trending,  steeply  dipping  tan  siltstone  and  sandstone  of 
the  Pico  Formation.  The  water-saturated  ^eak  rocks 
could  not  withstand  the  strong  shaking  on  the  steep 
slope.  Rocks  broke  into  pieces  a  fraction  of  an  inch 
to  as  much  as  several  feet  across  and  fell  or  rolled 
downslope  (photo  5).  Although  this  was  the  largest 
such  failure  observed  in  this  area,  other  small  debris 
falls  and  dr&gt;-  flows  were  very  common  along  steep 
slopes,  particularly  along  cuts  on  the  Grapevine  Can- 
yon road  and  in  the  Magazine  Canyon  area. 

Ground  Cracking 

Two  ridges  exhibited  the  peculiarly  cracked 
ground  referred  to  here  as  shattered  ridges.  One  was 
in  the  Towsley  Formation  in  the  N\\''4  of  Section 
19  under  transmission-line  towers  of  the  Los  Angeles

100  feet  (30  m)  apart  on  a  narrow,  steep  northeast- 
trending  ridge  extending  out  from  the  main  rnountain 
mass.  A  northwest-trending  and  steeply  dipping  fault 
separates  the  ridge  from  the  mountain  mass,  which  is 
composed  largely  of  pre-Cretaceous  biotitc  schist  and 
diorite  gneiss.  Thin  beds  of  fractured  siltstone,  sand- 
stone, and  shale  in  the  Towsle\-  Formation  strike 
northeast  parallel  to  the  long  narrow  ridge  and  dip 
about  80°  to  the  northwest.  The  steeply  inclined 
weak  beds  failed  under  the  strong  earthquake  motion. 
Crack  swarms  and  intcnseh-  broken  zones  were  de- 
yeloped  in  the  top  few  feet  of  weathered  bedrock  and 
soil.  Cracks  extend  about  200  feet  (60  m)  along  the 
ridge  under  both  towers.  Several  footings  and  em- 
bankment supports  for  the  towers  were  undermined 
or  failed,  but  fortunately  the  towers  did  not  fall 
(photo  6).

Another  shattered  ridge  (Hill  1863,  San  Fernando 
71/2'  quadrangle)  was  just  west  of  the  Los  Angeles 
City  Aqueduct  and  adjacent  to  the  access  road  to  the 
tank  that  feeds  the  air-splasher  drain.  Geologic  condi- 
tions here  are  similar  to  those  described  above.  The 
ridge  is  elongate  in  a  westerly  direction,  parallel  to  the 
strike  of  soil-mantled  siltstone  beds  in  the  Pico  Forma- 
tion. Beds  dip  very  steeply  north.  Cracks  and  broken 
ground  were  visible  for  about  300  feet  (90  m)  along 
the  ridge. 

The  access  road  to  the  tank  area  near  the  ridge 
showed  cracks  in  the  asphalt,  mostly  at  a  high  angle 
to  the  center  line.  Road  fill  also  cracked  but  mostly 
parellel  to  the  road.  Rock  falls  from  steep  road  cuts 
and  natural  slopes  were  common  in  the  fractured  and 
fine-grained  rocks  of  the  Pico  Formation.  The  as- 
phalt-covered cut  at  the  west  end  of  Hill  1863  failed 
locally.  Extensive  cracking  in  the  asphalt  took  place  in 
the  tank  area.  Sinking  occurred  locally  on  asphalt- 
covered  fill  over  the  pipeline  leading  into  the  tank. 

i\n  area  of  deformation  was  noted  in  clastic  rocks 
of  the  Pico  Formation  near  the  air-splasher  drain. 
x\bout  mid-May  down  the  hill  and  about  20  feet  (6 
m)  east  of  the  drain  were  two  surface  cracks  and  an 
area  of  shattered  ground.  Both  cracks  were  Avell  ex- 
posed in  a  small  cliff.  The  crack  to  the  -west  trended 
north  parallel  to  the  drain,  was  nearly  vertical,  and 
extended  down  at  least  3  feet  (1  m).  About  3  feet 
(1  m)  west,  there  was  another,  larger,  crack.  This 
crack  trended  a  little  cast  of  north,  and  near  the 
ground  surface  rocks  were  pulled  apart  several  inches 
along  it.  It  is  exposed  for  a  few  tens  of  feet  (several 
meters)  along  the  strike  and  in  the  cliff  face  for  about 
10  feet  (3  m)  of  depth  at  right  angles  to  the  dip. 
Near  the  surface,  the  crack  dips  55°  east,  but  within  a 
distance  of  only  several  feet  it  shallows  in  a  gentle 
arc  to  about  30°  east  (photo  7).  A  few  feet  to  the

south  is  a  zone  of  shattered  ground  about  20  feet  (6 
m)  wide  and  100  feet  (30  m)  long  parallel  to  the 
drain.  Both  the  cracks  and  shattered  ground  ha%'e 
resulted  from  strong  ground  siiaking  in  fractured 
weak  rocks. 

Further  down  slope,  in  a  flattish  area  near  where 
the  drain  and  pipeline  pass  under  the  Golden  State 
Freeway,  a  different  tvpc  of  damage  occurred.  This 
area  is  underlain  1)\-  siltstones  of  the  Sunshine  Ranch 
Member  of  the  Saugus  Formation,  w  ith  a  local  thin 
alluvial  cover.  Drain  walls  were  cracked  and  broken 
near  the  underpass,  as  were  water  pipes.  The  roof 
of  the  underpass  failed,  dropping  down  about  a  foot 
and  a  half  (half  a  meter)  on  the  east  and  breaking  one 
of  eight  attached  electric  lines.  An  air  gap  was  visible 
against  the  west  wall  of  the  underpass  where  shaking 
had  caused  the  wM  to  separate  from  the  adjacent  fill. 
The  floor  of  the  underpass  adjacent  to  the  ^\'all  was 
cracked  for  about  150  feet  (4.'&gt;  m)  from  the  northeast 
entrance. 

About  500  feet  (150  m)  north  of  the  underpass  a 
200-foot-long  (60  m)  crack,  as  much  as  2  inches  (5 
cm)  wide,  opened  up  parallel  to  the  drain.  The  crack 
was  in  fill  and  about  2  feet  (2/3  m)  from  the  side 
wall  of  the  drain.  In  the  same  area  are  two  culverts 
which  carry  water  from  the  older  pipeline  system  to 
the  new  one.  Cracks  developed  in  the  fill  adjacent  to 
and  parallel  ^\•ith  the  culvert  walls. 

.Minor  ground  cracks  in  the  Towsley  Formation 
are  well  exposed  in  a  25-foot  (8  m)  cut  along  the  ac- 
cess road  for  the  Saugus  pipeline  (Pipeline  Station 
7774-55.05),  .southwest"  of  Hill  1879  (San  Fernando 
IVz'  quadrangle)  and  east  of  the  Sierra  Highway  in- 
tersection ^\■ith  the  Golden  State  Freeway.  Beds  ex- 
posed in  the  cut  are  much  fractured,  friable,  brownish 
siltstone  and  light  gray,  fine-grained  sandstone.  They 
strike  east-nortlieast  and  dip  60°  north-northwest.  A 
3-foot  (1  m)  high  cut  was  made  at  right  angles  to  the 
road  cut  and  at  a  high  angle  to  bedding  to  install  an  air- 
vent  tower  (this  is  the  highest  elevation  in  this  area  for 
the  pipeline).  The  tower  is  about  35  feet  (11  m)  in 
elevation  above  the  pipeline,  .\ftcr  excavation  the  area 
around  the  tower  was  backfilled  and  a  concrete  fac- 
ing was  placed  on  the  road  cut.  During  strong  shak- 
ing, cracks  developed  ncarl\-  parallel  to  the  excava- 
tion (right  angles  to  the  cut)  from  the  surface  down 
to  about  20  feet  (6  m).  Cracks  were  visible  on  the 
hilltop  parallel  to  the  vent-cut  for  a  few  yards  to  the 
northeast. 

Ground  Rupture 

There  was  ground  rupture  about  600  feet  (180 
m)  north  of  the  Los  .Angeles  City  .\queduct  under- 
pass of  the  Golden  State  Freeway.  Rupturing  took 
place  on  an  elongate  south-trending  ridge  at  an  eleva- 
tion of  about  1425  feet  (430  m)  in  a  location  under 
the  westernmost  pipeline.  This  area  is  underlain  b\- 
soil-covered  siltstone  of  the  Sunshine  Ranch  Member 
of  the  Saugus  Formation.  North-trending  ground 
cracks  and  depressions  were  observed  in  a  zone  about 
15  feet  (5  m)  wide  and  40  feet  (12  m)  long.  At  the 
south,  a  west-trending  rupture  /one  appeared  to  trun- 
cate the  cracks  and  passed  under  the  pipeline,  ruptur- 
ing the  foundation  and  buckling  a  drain  pipe  in  the

process  (photo  8).  Soil  was  hea\ed  up  near  the  inter- 
section. This  feature  plus  the  buckled  drain  implied 
compression  and  possible  faulting.  Xo  bedrock  was 
observed;  there  was  a  grass  cover  on  the  soil,  so  no 
definitive  information  was  obtained  about  the  rupture. 
As  a  result  of  ground  deformation,  the  foundations 
for  the  pipeline  were  tilted  down  on  the  east  and  ro- 
tated to  the  south  several  inches  for  a  distance  of 
about  150  feet  (50  m). 
Cracking  in  Roads,  Road  Fills,  and  Other  Fills 

Cracks  dexclopcd  in  nearly  all  road  fills  of  any 
size,  as  well  as  in  fills  adjacent  to  the  aqueduct,  free- 
way underpass,  and  bridge  structures.  F,xtensi\e  cracks 
were  found  in  both  asphalt  and  concrete  road  paving. 

GROUND  SHAKING  ON  GRADED  ALLUVIUM 

Buildings  of  various  sorts  erected  on  graded  allu- 
vial cover  over  the  Saugus  and  .Mint  Canyon  Forma- 
tions were  badly  damaged  by  ground  shaking. 

In  downtown  New  hall,  all  of  the  four  existing 
uiircinforccd  masonrs-  buildings  sustained  such  severe 
structural  damage  that  thc\'  were  inuuediatel\'  con- 
demned and  demolished  soon  after*.  Other  downtown 
buildings  had  such  minor  damage  as  cracked  plaster 
and  broken  w  indow  s;  there  was  extensive  breakage  of 
merchandise  shaken  froni  shelves  in  stores. 

Two  old  wooden  frame  houses  (24739  Walnut 
Avenue  and  24746  Xcwhall  .Xxenue)  were  shaken  off 
their  foumlarion  supports  (two-b&gt;-fours  placed  on 
end  on  mudsills)  and  partiall\"  collapsed.  Soon  after 
the  earthquake,  they  were  condemned  and  de- 
molished. 

Several  Southern  California  Gas  Company  gas 
mains  in  Newhall  cracked  or  were  broken.  One  main 
caught  on  fire  and  burned  until  mid-morning  of  Feb- 
ruary ')  before  being  extinguished.  Another  main  ex- 
plotlcd  during  the  first  strong  morion,  creating  an 
8-foot-deep  (2.5  ni)  crater.  .A  motorist  was  driving 
by  at  just  that  moment;  his  car  slid  slowly  into  the 
crater  as  the  walls  began  to  slip  back  into  the  center

after  the  initial  explosion  (photo  9).  Fortunately  the 

main  did  not  catch  fire;  and  the  motorist  escaped 
unhurt. 

Water  from  a  broken  main  flooded  the  basement 
of  the  Pacific  Telephone  Company  oflice,  damaging 
equipment  and  stopping  all  telephone  service  to  the 
greater  Newhall  area.  Si.x  pump  trucks  were  required 
to  remove  the  water,  but  some  service  was  restored 
by  afternoon.  This  incident  gave  rise  to  the  rumor 
that  Newhall  was  flattened  by  the  earthquake. 

In  Valencia,  buildings  in  the  Old  Orchard  and 
L&gt;'ons  Plaza  Shopping  Centers  sustained  such  light 
damage  as  fallen  ceiling  panels,  wall  cracks,  and  nu- 
merous broken  display  windows.  Liquor  stores,  mar- 
kets, and  drug  stores,  however,  had  heavy  damage  to 
bottled  and  canned  goods  which  were  toppled  over 
and  destroyed.  New  homes  north  of  Lyons  Avenue 
and  west  of  the  Old  Orchard  Shopping  Center  had 
light  damage.  The  toppling  of  brick  chimnevs  and 
block  walls  was  common,  as  was  cracking  of  walls 
adjacent  to  window  frames.  Street  and  driveway 
cracks  were  numerous  also. 

Thatcher  Glass  Company  in  Saugus  sustained  the 
most  damage  to  any  industry  in  this  entire  area.  Two 
of  their  three  furnaces  were  broken  and  molten  glass 
oozed  from  splits  down  to  the  floor  and  around  the 
furnace  foundations,  melting  part  of  them.  The  foun- 
dation of  the  third  furnace  \\'as  damaged  but  not 
severely.  A  million  or  more  bottles  were  broken. 
About  500  of  the  700  employees  of  the  plant  were 
out  of  work  for  about  two  months.  Total  damage  was 
at  least  a  million  dollars. 

Directly  across  San  Fernando  Road  from 
Thatcher  Glass  Company,  a  garage  and  a  pet  shop, 
both  made  of  unreinforced  masonry,  had  extensive 
structural  damage  and  were  condemned  and  de- 
molished. 

Solemint  was  the  hardest  hit  of  any  communit&gt;' 
in  the  area  under  discussion.  It  is  only  about  5  miles 
(8  km)  northwest  of  the  epicentral  area.  Not  only 
are  most  structures  on  graded  alluvium,   but  water 


well  data  indicate  there  is  a  relatively  high  ground- 
water surface  in  at  least  part  of  the  area. 

Water  level  in  a  Los  Angeles  County  Flood  Con- 
trol well  near  the  intersection  of  Camp  Plent\-  and 
Soledad  Canyon  roads  was  30  feet  (9  m)  below  the 
surface  in  January  1971;  31  feet  on  February  10,  1971; 
and  30  feet  in  September  1971.  During  April  1969, 
the  ^\'ater  level  was  only  7  feet  (2  m)  below  the  sur- 
face. Another  well,  about  2000  feet  (600  m)  east  of 
Solemint  Junction  and  just  north  of  Soledad  Canyon 
Road,  showed  the  following  levels  below  the  surface: 
9  feet  (2.7  m),  Januarv  1971;  10  feet  (3  m),  February 
10,  1971;  17  feet  (5  m),  September  1971. 

A  prominent  north-northeast-trending  swarm  of 
discontinuous  ground  cracks  was  developed  about  4000 
feet  (1.2  km)  west  of  Solemint  Junction.  These  were 
well  exposed  over  a  zone  as  wide  as  75  feet  (20  m)  on 
Soledad  Canyon  Road,  where  they  broke  asphalt  pav- 
ing and  curbs  and  disrupted  water  lines.  Some  cracks 
continued  north  across  the  road  through  a  broken 
block  wall  and  into  Plumwood  Avenue.  Tract  homes 
in  this  area  sustained  broken  chimneys,  block-wall 
failure,  and  other  street  cracking  not  on  line  with 
the  prominent  swarm.  South  of  Soledad  Canyon 
Road,  the  swarm  of  discontinuous  cracks  could  be 
traced  through  an  open  field  as  far  south  as  the  Santa 
Clara  River  flood-control  levee,  a  distance  of  roughly 
1000  feet  (300  m).  The  reason  for  the  development 
of  the  cracks  and  their  apparent  linearity  is  not 
known.  They  may  represent  a  fault  zone  on  which 
there  was  little,  if  any,  displacement;  they  may  be  a 
result  of  localized  strong  earth  motion  in  alluvium 
with  a  high  ground  water  surface;  or  they  may  indi- 
cate a  shelf  area  in  bedrock,  now  covered  by  allu- 
vium. 

Damage  in  the  North  Oaks  Shopping  Center  in 
Solemint  was  extensive.  The  roofs  of  Grant's  Depart- 
ment Store  and  the  Builders  Emporium,  both  made  of 
unreinforced  brick,  partially  collapsed;  and,  because 
some  of  the  beams  supporting  the  roof  had  been 
shaken  away  from  the  brick  w^alls,  those  sections  ad- 
jacent to  the  wall  collapsed.  Both  buildings  were  com- 
pletely repaired  within  two  months  after  the  earth- 
quake. All  stores  in  the  Shopping  Center  had 
extensive  damage  to  goods,  and  nearly  all  display  win- 
dows were  broken.  Asphalt  pavement  in  the  parking 
lots  was  cracked. 

Tract  homes  in  the  Solemint  area  sustained  block- 
\\  all  failure,  chimney  damage,  and  wall  cracks.  Streets 
and  driveways  cracked  because  of  shifting  of  the  road 
base  by  shaking. 

Mobile-home  parks,  of  which  there  are  several  in 
the  Solemint  area,  had  extensive  damage.  Nearly  all 
the  trailers  were  shaken  off"  their  jacks,  some  so 
quickly  that  the  jacks  pierced  the  trailer  floors.  Other 
trailers  were  warped  during  the  shaking  process.  One 
trailer  at  the  Cordova  Mobile  Home  Park  snapped 
the  gas  main  as  it  went  off  the  jacks  and  burned.  All 
of  the  280  mobile  homes  in  the  Park  sustained  at  least 
S500  damage. 

Damage  in  Friendly  \''allcy,  south  of  Solemint 
Junction,  was  significant  but  not  severe.  Windows  in 
commercial    buildings   were    broken,    and    there   was

some  wall  nnd  merchandise  damage.  Tract  homes  in 
this  area  showed  block-wall,  chimney,  and  other 
minor  damape.  Streets  cracked.  All  Mater  service  to 
FriendK-  X'alley  was  stopped  on  February  9,  as  main 
lines  broke  in  two  places. 

GROUND  SHAKING  IN  THE  CRYSTALLINE  ROCKS 

Most  damage  in  this  geologic  environment  was 
restricted  to  roads,  road  cuts,  and  fills.  Rock  falls  and 
debris  flows  were  common  on  steep  slopes  in  the 
northern  part  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  but  be- 
cause the  area  is  little  developed  there  was  little  dam- 
age to  structures.  The  largest  known  rock  fall  took 
place  on  the  steep  and  fractured  slopes  of  the  Schmitt 
Quarry  in  the  central  part  of  Section  16  about  a  mile 
and  a  half  east  of  Lang,  adjacent  to  Soledad  Canyon 
Road. 

There  were  small  slides  in  road  cuts,  extensive 
cracks  in  asphalt  paving,  and  cracks  in  every  road 
fill  along  Sand  Canyon  and  Little  Tujunga  roads  from 
Live  Oak  Campground  to  at  least  the  Pacoima  Reser- 
voir area.  Cracks  in  nearly  every  fill  paralleled  the 
road,  and  cracks  in  the  asphalt  paving  were  commonly 
at  high  angles  to  the  road  center  line.  This  section  of 
road  was  closed  for  several  days  after  the  earthquake. 

Placerita  Canyon  Road  was  similarly  damaged 
from  the  west  edge  of  the  State  Park  to  within  about 
a  mile  of  its  intersection  with  Sand  Canyon  Road. 
Within  a  day,  debris  was  cleared  away  so  that  traffic 
could  pass.  There  was  similar  damage  to  Soledad  Can- 
yon Road.  Road  cracks  and  minor  slides  occurred 
locally  from  just  west  of  Soledad  Guard  Station  all 
the  way  to  Ravenna. 

An  unusual  condition  developed  on  a  road-cut 
failure  about  a  mile  east  of  the  Soledad  Campground 
on  Soledad  Canyon  Road.  The  steep,  irregular  cut  is 
on  fractured  anorthositc  cut  by  numerous  irregularly 
shaped  dark,  fine-grained  dikes.  Adjacent  to  the  cut 
and  about  50  feet  (15  m)  above  road  level  is  a  home 
on  a  cut-and-fill  pad.  A  well-reinforced  block  wall 
was  built  near  the  edge  of  the  cut.  During  strong 
shaking,  parallel  cracks  developed  on  both  sides  of 
the  wall.  Near  the  center  of  the  wall,  rock  broke  out 
from  under,  leaving  an  air  gap  and  several  yards  of 
the  wall  foundation  exposed.  Because  of  the  steel  re- 
inforcement in  the  block  wall,  it  did  not  fail.  From 
road  level,  the  wall  now  looks,  in  part,  like  a  bridge 
(photo  10). 


GROUND  CRACKING  AND  SHAKING 
IN  THE  SAUGUS  FORMATION 

Most  damage  in  this  geologic  environment  was 
restricted  to  roads,  road  cuts,  and  fills.  Rock  falls  and 
debris  flows  were  common  on  steep  slopes  in  the 
northern  part  of  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains,  but  be- 
cause the  area  is  little  developed  there  was  little  dam- 
age to  structures.  The  largest  known  rockfall  took 
place  on  the  steep  and  fractured  slopes  of  the  Schmitt 
Quarry  in  the  central  part  of  Section  16  about  a  mile 
and  a  half  east  of  Lang,  adjacent  to  Soledad  Canyon 
Road. 

In  the  Rye  Canyon  Facilit\-  of  Lockheed  Aircraft 
Company  northeast  of  Castaic  Junction,  walls  in  sev- 
eral buildings  were  cracked  from  ceiling  to  floor.  As- 
phalt paving  on  the  parking  lot  for  the  main  office 
building  had  numerous  cracks,  but  the  cracks  did  not 
extend  into  the  surrounding  ground. 

There  were  ground  cracks  developed  in  one  area 
of  the  Princess  Estates.  The  highest  hill  in  the  tract 
had  been  graded  on  nearly  flat-lying  beds  of  the  Sau- 
gus  Formation.  Here,  at  the  end  of  Goldstream  Way, 
a  generally  west-trending  crack  swarm  was  developed. 
The  swarm  was  about  100  feet  (30  m)  wide,  roughly 
200  feet  (60  m)  long,  and  ended  at  a  cliff  face  on  the 
east.  Observations  on  the  cliff^  face  indicate  that  the 
cracks  were  nearly  vertical  and  did  not  extend  down 
more  than  20  to  30  feet  (6  to  9  m).  The  concrete 
slabs  for  t\\'o  unfinished  houses  and  the  asphalt  paving 
on  Goldstream  Wav  were  cracked  also.

Seismicolly  Triggered  Landslides  in  the  Area 
Above  the  San  Fernando  Valley 


by  Douglas  M.  AAorton 


Thousands  of  landslides  were  triggered  by  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971,  in  an  area 
of  250  km  ^  in  the  hilly  and  mountainous  terrain  above 
San  Fernando  Valley.  A  few  pre-existing  slides  were 
activated,  and  many  new  slides  formed.  The  gross  dis- 
tribution of  the  slides  was  controlled  primarily  by  the 
intensity  of  ground  shaking,  but  important  local  varia- 
tions in  the  density  of  landslides  reflect  variations  in 
the  character  and  structural  history  of  local  geologic 
formations  (table  1).  Some  landslides  were  localized 
along   fault   breaks.    The    earthquake    also   produced

slides are  plotted  on  plate  3  (this  Bulletin).

1971  storms. 


Table   ?.     Litbology  of  Quaternary  and  Terfiary  formations 


Formation 

Description 

Quaternary  alluvial  and 
terrace  deposits 

Stream-channel  and  flood-plain  deposits  consisting  of  a  great  variety  of  unconsolidated  and  loosely  consoli- 
dated brownish  and  grayish  "dirty",  unsorted,  angular  to  subangular  detritus  of  local  origin;  some  local  cemen- 
tation. 

Pleistocene  Pacoima 

Poorly  sorted  fanglomerate  or  sedimentary  breccia  consisting  of  sharply  angular  pebbles  and  boulders  of  wide 
size  range  deposited  with  a  dark  brown  or  reddish-brown  mudstone-soil  matrix.  Crudely  bedded  or  unstratified; 
lightly  cemented  in  some  places. 

Pleistocene  Saugus 

Light-colored,  poorly  sorted,  loosely  consolidated  conglomerate  and  coarse  sandstone,  commonly  crossbedded; 
deposited  as  fluviatile  and  alluvial-fan  sediments  around  the  western  end  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Much 
of  it  is  quite  well  cemented  and  will  stand  in  very  steep  slopes  without  failure.  Red  and  greenish  mudstone  and 
sandstone  in  lower  part. 

Pliocene  Towsley- 
Repetto 

The  base  of  the  "Towsley"  may  be  late  Miocene;  "Repetto"  is  early  Pliocene;  and  "Pico"  is  usually  middle 
and  late  Pliocene.  These  are  well-stratified  marine  sedimentary  rocks  which  are  predominantly  sandstone  but 
range  from  siltstone  to  conglomerate.  Massive  lenticular  conglomerate  beds  occur  in  some  sections  of  all  three 
units.  There  is  a  great  deal  of  siltstone  and  fine  sandy  shale  in  the  Repetto  unit  which  tends  to  break  down  or 
disintegrate  when  water-saturated.  The  thickbedded  conglomerate  members  tend  to  maintain  steep  and  re- 
sistant slopes. 

Modelo 

Wide  lithologic  variation  and  lenticularity  of  strata  characterize  the  Modelo,  but  fine  to  coarse  arkosic  sand- 
stone and  conglomerate  make  up  the  largest  proportion.  Thin-bedded  siliceous,  calcareous,  silty,  and  diatomaceous 
shales  are,  nevertheless,  the  most  distinctive  and  typical  lithologies  of  this  formation. 

some  areas  of  highly  fractured  rock,  especially  along 
ridge  tops,  that  are  likely  to  give  rise  to  abundant 
landslides  or  mudflows  when  saturated. 

This  report  updates  earlier  reports  (Morton, 
1971a,  1971b)  summarizing  a  photointerpretive  investi- 
gation of  landslides  triggered  by  the  earthquake.  The 
investigation  used  black-and-white  aerial  photographs 
taken  for  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  on  February  10, 
1971,  (American  Aerial  Surveys,  Inc.,  scale  1:10,000); 
color  photographs  taken  on  February  18,  1971,  (U.S.

time  of  the  earthquake.  Now  with  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey. 


LANDSLIDING 

Although  landsliding  was  a  direct  and  immediate 
response  to  ground  rupture  and  shaking  during  the 
earthquake,  some  rockfalls  continued  for  several  days 
along  steep  canyon  walls  (for  example,  Pacoima  and 
Little  Tujunga  Canyons).  Some  of  these  rockfalls  may 
have  been  triggered  by  aftershocks.  The  landslides 
were  concentrated  south-southwest  of  the  epicenter  of 
the  main  shock,  along  and  adjacent  to  the  area  of  tec- 
tonic surface  rupture,  and  within  the  area  of  principal 
aftershocks.

Local  variation  in  landslide  density  reflected  the 
character  of  local  rock  units  (table  1),  degree  of  frac- 
turing and  faulting,  and  the  presence  of  already 
formed  landslide  deposits.  Physiography  apparently 
controlled  the  density  of  landslides  only  where  slopes 
were  extremely  steep. 

Of  the  thousands  of  landslides  generated  or  reacti- 
vated, only  the  larger  ones  and  those  whose  displace- 
ment was  sufficient  to  produce  landslide  morphology 
or  to  give  rise  to  bare  areas  stripped  of  vegetation 
could  be  mapped  from  the  aerial  photographs  (figure 
1).  Landslides  within  the  valley  area  were  not  studied; 
for  the  nature  of  those  landslides  see  Youd,  1971,  and 
Smith  and  Fallgren,  this  Bulletin. 

TYPES  OF  SLOPE  FAILURES 

Rockfalls,  soil  falls,  debris  slides,  avalanches,  and 
slumps  were  the  principal  t&gt;'pes  of  landslides  triggered 
by  the  earthquake.  Surficial  (0.2  to  1  m  thick)  debris 
slides  and  avalanches  were  probably  the  most  wide- 
spread and  common  types  of  failure  and  were  espe- 
cially pronounced  in  areas  underlain  by  sedimentary 


rocks  (photo  1).  Some  minor  failures  were  localized 
along  a  single  bed  in  a  sedimentary  sequence  (photo 
2).  Rockfalls  were  common  on  steep-walled  canyon 
faces  cut  in  well-fractured  basement  rock  but  also  oc- 
curred in  sedimentary  rock  where  a  particularly  re- 
sistant bed  cropped  out  on  oversteepened  slopes 
(photo  3).  Soil  falls  occurred  mainly  at  the  free  face 
of  recent  stream  terrace  deposits  along  major  drain- 
ages but  were  also  common  along  some  ridges.  Slump- 
ing took  place  largely  on  reactivated,  pre-existing 
(pre-earthquake)  slumps  (photo  4). 

Some  landslides  in  the  hilly  area,  especially  be- 
tween Big  and  Little  Tujunga  Canyons  (Lakeview 
fault  segment),  resulted  from  primary  fault  displace- 
ment (Kahle,  this  Bulletin).  This  landsliding  originated 
by  a  combination  of  shaking  and  concomitant  over- 
steepening  due  to  thrusting  of  upper  plate  material  up- 
ward and  southward  towards  the  valley.  These  land- 
slides are  onlv  along  the  lines  of  fault  rupture  (photo 
5).

shaking  is  particularly  clear  in  the  westward-striking 
Pico,  Modeio,  Towsley,  and  Saugus  Formations  west 
of  the  San  Fernando  Valley.  There,  the  number  of 
landslides  decreases  markedly  along  strike  westward 
from  the  valley,  awa\-  from  the  area  of  aftershocks 
and  most  intense  tectonic  rupturing. 

Previously  weakened  rock  commonly  failed.  A 
number  of  old  landslides  were  reactivated,  as  shown 
by  fresh  scarps  from  0.25  to  about  10  m  high  (photo 
4).  Sonic  small  oversteepened  old  scarps  failed  as  debris 
slides.  Other  large,  old  slides  failed  in  part,  generating 
a  number  of  small  new  slides  generally  concentrated 
along  the  toe  of  the  old  slide  (for  example,  in  Pacoima 
Canyon,  figure  3).  Other  landslides  were  localized  by 
crushed  rock  along  older,  inactive  fault  zones.  Thus, 
the  San  Gabriel  fault  zone  was  the  locus  of  a  narrow 
band  of  landslides  north  of  Placerita  Canyon  (fig- 
ure 4). 

Landslides  were  also  common  in  excavations,  and 
many  roads  were  blocked  by  failures  in  cur  slopes 
(photo  6).  There  were  innumerable  minor  rockfalls 


Angtias 


in  roadcuts  in  the  area  of  figure  1  and  eastward 
throughout  most  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Fill 
failure  was  common. 

Large  rotational  or  complex  landslides,  which  are 
characteristic  of  the  San  Gabriel  and  Santa  Susana 
Mountains  (Morton  and  Streitz,  1969;  Saul,  this  Bul- 
letin), did  not  form  during  the  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake. Apparently  such  slides  form  under  different 
circumstances;  for  instance,  without  seismic  shaking 
at  times  when  the  ground  is  saturated  by  prolonged 
or  heavy  rain  or  by  seismic  shaking  with  longer  pe- 
riod vibrations  or  of  longer  duration  than  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake. 

Ground  fracturing  throughout  most  of  the  area  of 
figure  1  is  closely  related  to  landsliding.  Fracturing, 
not  accompanied  by  landsliding,  appears  to  be  most 
pronounced  along  ridge  tops,  where,  given  sufficient 
rainfall,  the  highly  fractured  surficial  materials  may 
give  rise  to  abundant  debris  slides  and  flows.  These 
materials  may  now  conceivably  have  the  potential  for 
generating  more  landslides  than  were  triggered  during

the  earthquake.  However,  rains  during  December  1971 
totaling  5  to  7  inches  in  the  area  resulted  in  no  sig- 
nificant failures  in  this  fractured  rock.  This  indicates 
that  greater  rainfall  is  required  to  initiate  failures. 
Lawson  (1908,  p.  386)  noted  that  cracks  developed 
without  landslide  movement  during  the  1906  San 
Francisco  earthquake.  Heavy  rainfall  during  the  fol- 
lowing 1906-07  winter  produced  many  slides  in  this 
fractured  ground,  which  Lawson  attributed  directly 
to  the  combination  of  fractured  ground  and  rainfall. 
DISTRIBUTION  OF  LANDSLIDES 
Landslide  distribution  controlled  by  rock  type  is 
best  seen  in  the  vicinity  of  Lopez  and  Bartholomaus 
Canyons  (figure  2  and  table  1).  Here,  numerous  land- 
slides formed  on  outcrops  of  the  Modelo  and  Tows- 
ley  Formations,  while  relatively  few  formed  on  the 


immediately  adjacent  Saugus  Formation.  There  were 
numerous  rockfalls  where  highly  fractured  basement 
rock  was  exposed  on  steep  slopes,  especially  along 
such  major  drainages  as  Pacoima,  Little  Tujunga,  and 
Big  Tujunga  Canyons.  Rockfalls  at  the  mouth  of 
Pacoima  Canyon  (figure  3)  covered  sizable  areas  but 
apparently  consisted  only  of  surficial  material. 

In  general,  landsliding  occurred  where  there  has 
been  little  residential  development,  largely  because  of 
the  steepness  of  the  natural  slopes.  Had  some  areas 
been  extensively  developed,  such  as  the  hilly  portion 
west  of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon,  landsliding  w-ould 
probably  have  exacted  a  considerable  toll.  In  addition 
to  the  failure  of  natural  materials,  failures  in  fill  would 
be  likely,  as  evidenced  by  widespread  failures  of  such 
material  elsewhere  during  the  earthquake.

Trenches  Dug  Across  Surface  Breaks 
of  fhe  San  Fernando  Fault 

by  the  California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology 
in  cooperation  with  F.  Beach  Leighton  &amp;  Associates 


Brief  descriptions  of  the  findings  in  fifteen  back- 
hoe  trenches  dug  by  the  California  Division  of  Mines 
and  Geology  in  cooperation  with  F.  Beach  Leighton 
and  Associates  are  given  here.  Trenching  was  done  in 
April  1971  to  examine  the  active  San  Fernando  fault 
zone  in  detail.  Logs  of  the  trenches  were  made  by 
E.  G.  Heath  and  R.  H.  Dickey  of  F.  Beach  Leighton 
and  Associates  and  by  J,  E.  Kahle  and  A.  G.  Barrows 
of  the  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology.  Logs  of  the 
trenches  may  be  consulted  in  the  Los  Angeles  District 
Office  of  the  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology.  Trench 
locations  are  shown  on  plate  3.  The  log  of  trench  8  is 
shown  on  plate  4. 


Trench  1:  Lopez  Canyon.  Trench  across  the  Oak  Hill  fault  scarp.  Bed- 
ding-plane fault  strikes  N.  75°  W.,  dips  62°  N.,  and  Is  nearly  coinci- 
dent with  attitude  of  sandstone,  siltstone,  and  conglomerate  strata. 
Displaced  base  of  slope  wash  and  alluvium  is  81  cm  (32  inches)  down 
on  the  south  side. 

Trench  2:  Lopez  Canyon.  Trench  across  mole  track  of  Oak  Hill  fault 
in  unconsolidated  fill  and  alluvium.  Although  surface  is  cracked,  no 
faulting  was  observed  in  the  trench. 

Trench  3:  Ridge  north  of  Carl  Street.  Trench  across  compression  ridge 
exposed  well-defined  single  fault  plane  that  strikes  east-west,  dips 
44°  N.,  and  coincides  with  ottitude  of  overlying  bedding.  Fault  jux- 
taposes Modelo  shale  on  the  north  over  colluvial  debris  with  coarse 
sandy   matrix   which   may   be   on   alluvial   fan   or  debris  flow   deposit. 

Trench  4:  Ridge  west  of  Blue  Star  Trailer  Court  and  north  of  Poxton 
Street.  Trench  across  60  cm  (2-foot)  scarp  in  soil  exposed  near-surface 
aspect  of  fault  plane  that  separates  Modelo  debris  on  the  north  con- 
taining shale  chips,  pebbles,  and  cobbles  from  poorly  bedded  old 
alluvium  and  colluvlum,  on  the  south.  In  most  of  the  exposure,  the 
fault  plane  dips  north  15°  but  bends  over  near  the  surface  and  dips 
shollowly  southward. 

Trench  5:  Pacoima  Wash  near  Newton  Street.  Trench  across  30  cm 
(1-foot)  scarp  of  Sylmar  fault  segment.  Fault  could  not  be  seen  In  the 
unconsolidared,  bouldery  alluvium.  Coving  limited  exposure  to  1.2  m 
(4-foot)  depth. 

Trench  6:  Big  Tujunga  Wash,  south  of  Big  Tujunga  Creek.  Trench 
across  50  to  60  cm  (20-  to  24-inch)  scarp  In  modern,  flat-lying,  boul- 
dery alluvium.  Directly  beneath  the  surface  offset,  a  jumbled  zone  dips 
approximately  45°  northward;  but  coarseness  of  material  and  lock  of 
marker  units  made  It  difficult  to  determine  whether  faulting  had  oc- 
curred. 

Trench   7:    Big    Tujunga    Wash,    north    of    Big    Tujunga    Creek.      Trench 


across  38  cm  (15-inch)  scarp.  Flat-lying  to  shollowly  south-dipping, 
sandy  and  bouldery,  moist  alluvial  layers,  which  ore  overlain  by  soil 
and  fill,  vaguely  appear  to  be  folded  beneath  scarp.  May  represent  a 
dispersion  of  a  discrete  fault  plane  in  unconsolidated  materials. 

Trench  8:  Blue  Star  Trailer  Court,  west  side  of  Lopez  Canyon.  Trench 
across  70  cm  (2.3-foot)  scarp  in  graded  bedrock  surfoce.  Movement 
during  earthquake  took  place  on  two  parallel  fault  planes  that  coin- 
cide with  the  N.  80°  W.  strike  and  32°  N.  dip  of  bedding  In  Modelo 
siltstone  and  sandstone.  Near  the  surface,  however,  the  northernmost 
fault  plane  bends  over  and  becomes  horizontal.  Trench  also  exposed 
north-dipping  undisturbed  fault  contact  between  overlying  highly  con- 
torted Modelo  sandstone  strata  and  reddish-brown  alluvial  and  col- 
luvial debris  (see  plate  4,  this  Bulletin). 

Trench  9:  Son  Fernando  Valley  Juvenile  Hall  grounds.  Trench  across 
main  trace  of  northern  set  of  cracks  in  football  field.  Moin  crock  was 
traced  in  moist  sandy  and  sllty  soil  containing  abundant  roots  to  a. 
depth  of  1.7  m  {5.5  feet)  to  the  upper  surface  of  a  gravelly  layer 
where  it  appeared  to  stop.  This  suggests  that  movement  took  place 
along  the  surface  of  the  gravelly  layer.  See  Smith  and  Fallgren,  this 
Bulletin,  for  background  on  Juvenile  Hall  area. 

Trench  10:  San  Fernando  Valley  Juvenile  Hall  between  inner  and  outer 
compound.  Trench  across  trace  of  southern  set  of  cracks.  Main  crock 
strikes  N.  10°  W.  and  extends  nearly  vertlcolly  2.75  m  (9  feet)  to 
bottom  of  trench  through  layers  of  silty  sand,  many  with  high  organic 
content. 


Trench    11:  South  of  Son  Ferno 
Juvenile  Hall.  Trench  in  open 
filled    crack    was    traced    2.75 
bottom   of  trench   In   dark    bro^

^eld  across  sand  boil.  Light  brown,  sand- 
m  (9  feet)  from  center  of  sand  boil  to 
Ity   sand.   The   filled   crack   represents 


the  fracture  through  which  material  travelled  to  surface  during  forma- 
tion of  the  sand  boil.  Its  total  depth  is  unknown. 

Trench  12:  Vacant  lot  at  12670  Gladstone  Avenue,  Sylmar.  Trench 
across  surface  cracks  aligned  with  fault  scarps  east  and  west  of  lot.  No 
significant  breaks  were  seen  in  the  unconsolidated  pebbly  to  bouldery 
conglomerate  and  Interlay ered  sand  strata  although  strata  appeared 
to  bend  to  conform  to  surface  warp  or  scarp. 


Trench  13:  North  shoulder  of  Foothill  Freeway,  west  of  Moclay  Street. 
Trench  across  30  cm  (1 -foot)  E-W  scarp  or  warp.  Fault  plane  dipping 
52  N.  was  traced  as  a  zone  of  looser  material  separating  gravelly 
and  cobbly  deposits  with  a  reddish  sandy  matrix  on  the  north  from 
adobe-like  material  of  possible  mudfiow  origin  on  the  south.

Ground  Displacement  of 
Son  Fernondo  Volley  Juvenile  Holl  ond 
the  Sylmor  Converter  Station 


by  Jay  L.  Smith  ^  and  Richard  B.  Fallgren  ^ 


The  San  Fernando  Valley  Juvenile  Hall  and  the 
Sylmar  Converter  Station  were  severely  damaged  dur- 
ing the  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971.  Although  lo- 
cated in  a  region  of  moderate  to  heavy  shaking  (Modi- 
fied Mercalli  intensity  about  VIII),  the  damage  to 
these  facilities  was  unusually  severe  owing  to  ground 
displacement.  Results  of  investigations  conducted  for 
the  County  of  Los  Angeles  and  the  Department  of 
Water  and  Power  of  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  have 
shown  that  local  soil  and  geologic  conditions  were  re- 
sponsible for  ground  displacement  and  damage  (Fall- 
gren and  Smith,  1971a  and  1971b).

Both  the  Juvenile  Hall,  a  juvenile-detention  facility,

The  area  is  approximately  7'/4  miles  south  of  the  epi- 
center of  the  February  9  earthquake  and  2'/2  miles 
northwest  of  the  known  surface  ruptures  along  the 
Sylmar  segment  of  the  San  Fernando  fault.  Damage 
to  the  facilities  resulted  from  severe  shaking  and  dif- 
ferential ground  movement.  Heaviest  damage  to  build- 
ings was  in  the  vicinity  of  the  permanent  ground  dis- 
placement (Youd,  1971). 

ZONE  OF  DISPLACEMENT 

The  limits  of  the  zone  of  displacement  are  indicated 
by  the  pattern  of  ground-surface  ruptures  shown  on 
figure  2.  The  zone  is  4000  feet  long  with  a  maximum 
width  of  900  feet.  It  extends  from  a  point  500  feet 
northeast  of  the  Juvenile  Hall  to  within  the  Sylmar 
Converter  Station  site  at  the  edge  of  Upper  Van 
Norman  Reservoir.  The  ground  surface  descends  ap- 
proximately 40  feet  in  elevation  along  the  length  of 
the  zone,  an  average  slope  of  about  1  percent.  Move- 
ment within  the  zone  was  downslope  in  a  southwest 
direction.  The  north  boundary  of  the  zone  bisects  the 
Juvenile  Hall  site  and  transects  the  southeastern  third 
of  the  Converter  Station  site.  Ground  ruptures  along 
this  boundary  indicate  right-lateral  slip,  and  the  trend 
of  major  cracks  is  generally  parallel  to  the  direction 
of  movement  of  the  displaced  zone.  The  south  bound- 
ary of  the  zone  crosses  the  southeast  corner  of  the 
Juvenile  Hall  site  and  extends  into  the  Converter  Sta- 
tion site  south  of  the  main  building.  Ground  ruptures 
along  this  boundary  are  characterized  by  left-lateral 
slip,  and  the  larger  cracks  generally  trend  nearly  north 
in  an  ew  echelon  pattern,  approximately  45  degrees  to 
the  direction  of  gross  movement. 

The  amount  of  relative  lateral  movement  within  the 
displaced  zone  (figure  3)  is  based  on  measured  offsets 
of  curbs  and  property  lines  crossing  the  zone.  These 
offsets  indicate  as  much  as  5  feet  of  relative  lateral 
movement  at  the  Juvenile  Hall  site.  The  same  magni- 
tude of  relative  movement  occurred  as  far  to  the 
southwest  as  Sepulveda  Boulevard,  adjacent  to  the 
Converter  Station.  However,  southwest  of  the  drainage 
channel,  which  separates  the  Converter  Station  from 
Sepulveda  Boulevard,  the  lateral  movements  measured 
were  no  greater  than  2  feet. 

The  ground  cracks  were  examined  to  depths  of  15 
feet  in  trenches  excavated  across  the  displacement-zone 
boundaries  at  the  Juvenile  Hall  and  southwest  of  San

Fernando  Road.  In  general,  the  cracks  died  out  and 
curved  inward  ^ith  depth  toward  the  interior  of  the 
zone  of  displacement.  Figure  4  represents  the  condi- 
tions encountered  in  a  trench  trending  nearh-  north 
across  the  north  boundary  of  the  zone  on  the  Juvenile 
Hall  site.  The  largest  crack  coincides  with  a  7-inch 
vertical  displacement  of  the  ground  surface,  and  under- 
l\ing  soil  contacts  are  similarly  displaced.  Near  the 
bottom  of  the  trench,  however,  the  crack  is  coincident 
w  ith  a  displaced  soil-contact  that  has  almost  twice  the 
amount  of  offset  of  higher  strata.  In  view  of  the  lateral 
continuity  of  the  boundaries  of  the  involved  soil 
horizons,  such  a  difference  must  represent  evidence  of 
prior  displacement.  Narrow  vertical  zones  of  soft  soil, 
truncated  at  the  top  by  alluvium  and  fill  soil,  were 
also  found.  Since  vertical  displacement  is  not  apparent, 
these  zones  most  probably  represent  loosel\-  filled  ten- 
sion cracks  produced  by  displacement  prior  to  1971. 


GEOLOGIC  AND  SOIL  CONDITIONS 

Juvenile  Hall  and  the  Sylmar  Converter  Station  are 
near  the  intersection  of  Grapevine  Canyon  and  Wel- 
don  Can\on,  both  south-draining  valleys  of  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains  (figure  5).  These  valleys,  and 
others  immediatcl)'  to  the  east  and  west,  have  steep 
flanking  ridges  and  gently  sloping  alluvial  fans  at  their 
mouths.  The  fans  have  accumulated  in  a  northeast- 
trending  depression  in  the  Saugus  Formation  between 


the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  and  the  .Mission  Hills.  This 
depression  generally  coincides  with  the  projected  trend 
of  the  Mission  Hills  syncline  (Merifield,  1958). 

The  east-flanking  ridge  of  Grape\ine  Can\on  e.\- 
tends  into  the  northwest  corner  of  the  Juvenile  Hall 
site.  The  ridge  is  underlain  b&gt;-  siltstone,  sandstone,  and 
conglomerate  of  the  Saugus  Formation.  The  maximum 
depth  to  bedrock  beneath  the  Juvenile  Hall  site  and 
in  the  central  part  of  the  depression  is  unknown.  Bed- 
rock is  not  exposed  at  the  Converter  Station  site. 

The  alluvial  fans  beneath  the  Juvenile  Hall  site  de- 
veloped during  late  Pleistocene  and  Holocene  time  at 
the  mouths  of  Grapevine  Can\on  and  smaller  valle\s 
immediately  east.  They  were  deposited  chiefly  by 
torrential  streamflow  and  occasional  mud-flows.  Large 
composite  fans  have  also  developed  belo\\-  Sombrero 
and  Weldon  Canyons.  As  a  consequence  of  the  merg- 
ing of  three  fans — the  \^'eldon  fan  from  the  north- 
west, the  Grapevine  fan  from  the  north,  and  the  Som- 
brero fan  from  the  northeast — a  low  land  has  developed 
at  their  intersection  in  the  area  bet\\een  Juvenile  Hall 
and  Upper  \'an  Norman  Reservoir,  including  the  Con- 
verter Station. 

The  properties  of  the  alluvium  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  sites  were  investigated  by  means  of  bucket-auger 
borings  as  deep  as  SO  feet  and  by  penetrometer  sound- 
ings along  the  Golden  State  Freew  a\-.  The  profile  of 
materials  along  a  section-line  crossing  the  Juvenile 
Hall   from   northwest  to   the  southeast   is  shown  in

figure  6.  This  section  is  taken  along  a  line  transverse 
to  the  direction  of  movement  within  the  zone  of  dis- 
placement. The  sand  and  silt  are  typical  of  material 
near  the  termini  of  most  merging  alluvial  fans.  The 
significant  feature,  however,  is  the  existence  of  a  soft, 
saturated  zone  underlying  the  dense,  dry  upper  zone. 
Alluvium  in  the  soft  zone  consists  of  sandy  silt  and 
fine  sand  of  a  uniform  texture.  A  similar  profile  was 
disclosed  in  a  penetrometer  survey  by  the  California 
Division  of  Highways   (C.  E.  Marek,  written  com- 


munication, September  1971)  along  the  Golden  State 
Freeway  (figure  7). 

Contours  of  depth  to  ground  water  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  Juvenile  Hall  are  based  on  data  from  the  recent 
bucket-auger  borings  and  from  nearby  wells.  The 
ground  water  surface  generally  conforms  to  the  topog- 
raphy, being  nearest  the  ground  surface  in  the  low 
area  south  of  the  Juvenile  Hall.  (See,  also,  paper  by 
Brown,  this  Bulletin).

boundaries  of  the  zone  of  displacement  are  related  to 
the  existence  of  relatively  brittle  surface  soils,  both 
natural  and  fill.  The  natural  surface  soils,  where  ex- 
posed on  the  Juvenile  Hal!  site,  consist  of  hard,  dry, 
and  slightly  cemented  clayey  sand  to  a  depth  of  sev- 
eral feet.  An  exposure  of  this  is  shown  in  photo  1, 
where  the  underlying  softer  soils  have  been  consoli- 
dated by  the  blast  from  a  small  dynamite  charge  dur- 
ing a  seismic  refraction  survey.  The  fill  soils,  because 
of  their  relatively  dense  and  dry  conditions,  are  also 
brittle  as  compared  to  the  moist  deeper  soils.  Long 
and  reiativel\-  continuous  ground  ruptures  along  the 
north  boundary  of  the  displacement  zone  were  gen- 
erally found  in  the  crust-like  soils  described  above. 
Due  to  the  lack  of  brittle  surface  soils,  surface  ruptures 
along  the  south  boundary  were  shorter  and  less  well 
developed,  tending  toward  an  en  echelon  pattern. 

A  generalized  profile  near  the  center  of  the  dis- 
placed zone,  based  on  the  borings,  shows  20  feet  of 
medium  dense  and  moist  silty  sand  overlying  a  10-foot- 
thick  layer  of  soft,  saturated  sandy  silt  and  fine  sand. 
The  response  of  this  soil  to  lateral  forces  generated  by 
the  earthquake  would  result  in  large,  nonelastic  shear- 
ing strains  throughout  the  depth  of  the  soft  soil  layer. 
Shear  strain  in  this  layer  during  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  may  have  resulted  in  a  maximum  net  down- 
slope  lateral  displacement  of  the  ground  surface  on  the 


order  of  3  inches  during  each  cycle  of  strong  shaking. 
The  San  Fernando  earthquake  produced  about  20 
c\cles  of  strong  shaking.  Therefore,  a  total  ground 
surface  displacement  of  about  5  feet  can  be  accounted 
for  in  this  way.  Displacement  away  from  the  center  of 
the  zone  of  movement  was  less,  depending  on  the 
thickne.ss  and  consistency  of  the  soft  layer. 

Some  of  the  saturated  soils  in  the  zone  of  displace- 
ment consist  of  uniform,  fine  sand  with  a  mean  grain 
size  between  0.075  and  0.2  mm.  These  soils  have  a  po- 
tential for  liquefaction  during  strong  shaking  (Seed, 
1971).  The  existence  of  sand  boils  in  the  high  ground 
water  area  southeast  of  Juvenile  Hall  is  evidence  of 
this  local  liquefaction.  However,  soils  with  liquefac- 
tion potential  are  not  sufficiently  widespread  through- 
out the  zone  of  displacement  to  account  for  the  lack 
of  stability  of  the  area  during  the  earthquake.  The  soft 
and  loose  saturated  soils  have  sufficiently  low  strength 
under  static  conditions  to  account  for  the  downslope 
ground  movement  during  strong  shaking.  Large-scale 
liquefaction  would  have  resulted  in  much  greater  dis- 
placements. It  is  concluded,  therefore,  that  liquefac- 
tion played  a  minor  role  in  the  performance  of  the 
site  during  the  earthquake. 

Two  northeast-trending  faults  have  been  recognized 
in  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  immediately  above  Olive 
View  Hospital  (figure  5).  These  are  the  Olive  View  and

North  Olive  View  faults  (Proctor,  1968).  Projection  of 
one  of  these  faults  to  the  southwest  through  the  site 
was  made  by  Merifield  (1958).  A  careful  examination 
was  made  of  the  hillside  exposure  of  these  faults  after 
the  earthquake  of  February  9.  There  are  irregular  and 
discontinuous  cracks  associated  with  slumping  on  steep 
slopes  in  many  nearby  places.  Except  for  a  thrust  dis- 
placement of  less  than  an  inch  across  one  shear  surface 
about  100  feet  long  within  the  zone  (F.  Harold 
Weber,  Jr.,  oral  communication),  no  evidence  was  ob- 
served that  slip  occurred  on  the  Olive  View  faults 
during  the  San  Fernando  earthquake.  Trenches  across 
the  zone  of  displacement  within  and  outside  Juvenile 
Hall  disclosed  no  evidence  of  offset  lithology  in  the 
upper  15  feet  of  alluvium  attributable  to  slip  on  a 
fault.  Survey  data  indicate  that  there  has  been  net 
relative  displacement  of  a  few  inches  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  Juvenile  Hall  and  Converter  Station  outside  of 
the  displacement  zone  (Youd,  1972).  This  movement 
may  be  related  to  displacements  across  faults  in  the 
underlying  rock  during  the  earthquake  of  February  9. 
It  is  our  opinion,  however,  that  tectonic  slip,  if  any, 
on  the  Olive  View  faults  was  minor  and  did  not  in- 
fluence the  displacement  of  the  ground  at  Juvenile 
Hall. 

Our  investigation  indicates  that  ground  displacement 
under  future  seismic  conditions  can  be  expected  to  re- 


main confined  to  the  zone  of  displacement  that  de- 
veloped during  the  San  Fernando  earthquake.  This 
conclusion  is  based  on  the  lateral  extent  of  the  soft 
soils  responsible  for  the  movement  and  on  geologic 
evidence  that  past  displacement  has  occurred  along  this 
same  zone. 

CONCLUSIONS 

1.  Permanent  ground  displacement  in  the  vicinit&gt;' 
of  Juvenile  Hall  and  the  Converter  Station  was  the 
result  of  settlement  and  gradual  migration  of  soft 
soil  downslope  in  a  narrow  zone  during  the  earthquake. 

2.  The  zone  owes  its  displacement  to  the  combined 
effects  of  deposition  of  soft  alluvium  in  a  bedrock  de- 
pression, coalescing  alluvial  fans,  and  the  presence  of 
near-surface  ground  water. 

3.  While  it  is  likely  that  local  liquefaction  of  soils 
m  the  displaced  zone  took  place,  soils  with  liquefac- 
tion potential  are  not  sufficiently  widespread  through- 
out the  zone  to  account  for  the  lack  of  stability 
during  the  earthquake. 

4.  Tectonic  slip  on  faults  in  the  vicinity  could  not 
be  demonstrated  as  a  cause  of  the  displacement. 

5.  Past  displacements  of  a  similar  nature  have  oc- 
curred in  the  area  and  additional  displacements,  with 
characteristics  similar  to  those  of  February  9,  1971, 
may  be  expected  in  future  earthquakes. 


CHAPTER    13 


History  and  Dofo  of  Crusfol  Movement  Investigations 

in  California' 


by  Roger  W.  Greensfelder ' 


Crustal  movement  occurs  in  two  basic  forms: 
1)  fault  slip,  which  may  take  place  either  through 
brittle  fracture,  causing  an  earthquake,  or  as  aseismic 
plastic  flow,  called  "creep";  2)  distortion  or  strain 
(see  glossary)  which  may  be  distributed  over  a  region 
many  miles  wide.  We  are  chiefly  concerned  with 
aseismic  fault  slip  and  fault-related  strain  in  this  dis- 
cussion. 

Visible  fault  rupture  accompanying  an  earthquake 
was  apparently  first  recognized  in  1819  after  the 
Cutch,  India,  earthquake  (Richter,  1958,  p.  189). 
Since  that  time,  surface  faulting  has  been  reported  on 
most  continents,  most  notably  in  western  North 
America,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  and  Turkey  (Richter, 
1958,  p.  200-201).  Creep  and  strain  are  subtler  phe- 
nomena than  rupture  and  so  were  not  recognized  until 
recently.  The  phenomenon  of  earth  strain  was  recog- 
nized first  by  H.  F.  Reid  (1910,  p.  16-28)  in  his 
analysis  of  triangulation  data  in  connection  with  the 
great  1906  "San  Francisco"  earthquake.  Fault  creep 
(though  not  called  by  that  name)  was  first  reported 
in  the  literature  by  T.  W.  Koch  (1933)  in  connection 
with  the  active  Buena  Vista  thrust  fault  near  Taft, 
Kern  County,  California,  which  had  caused  consid- 
erable damage  to  oil  wells  and  pipelines  passing  over 
or  through  the  fault. 

Most  historic  surface  faulting  in  North  America 
has  taken  place  in  California  and  western  Nevada 
(Bonilla,  1967).  The  earliest  unmistakable  occurrence 
of  historic  surface  faulting  in  California  (and  the 
United  States  for  that  matter)  was  in  connection  with 
the  great  Fort  Tejon  earthquake  of  1857,  which  was 
accompained  by  surface  rupture  on  a  225-miIe-long 
segment  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  between  Cholame 
and  San  Bernardino  (figure  1);  right  lateral  offset  was 
perhaps  as  much  as  10  m.  However,  earlier  earth- 
quakes were  accompanied  by  ground  breakage  of  an 
unspecified  nature:  in  1836  on  the  Hayward  fault;  in 
1838  on  the  San  Andreas  fault,  San  Francisco  penin- 
sula; and  in  1852  on  the  Big  Pine  fault.  Since  1857, 
surface  rupture  has  been  reported  for  19  earthquakes 
in  California  (figure  1),  the  most  recent  being  that 
which  accompanied  the  San  Fernando  earthquake. 

Although,  in  its  most  general  sense,  the  term 
"crustal  movement"  includes  short-period  motions 
caused  by  the  passage  of  seismic  waves,  this  discussion 
is  limited  to  permanent  and  ultra-long  period  (greater

than  1  year)  deformations.  Such  deformations  are  not 
always  closely  associated  with  seismic  energy  release, 
but  certainly  interest  in  earthquake  prediction  is  chiefly 
responsible  for  recently  increased  eff^orts  to  monitor 
crustal  movement.  In  regard  to  earthquake  prediction, 
the  measurement  of  long-term  strain  rates,  as  well  as 
short-term  precursory  strain  events,  is  of  particular 
importance. 

Geodetic  triangulation  (see  glossary)  following 
the  1906  earthquake  provided  the  first  instrumental 
measurements  of  crustal  displacements,  and  until  very 
recently  triangulation  \\as  the  onl\'  instrumental 
method  employed  for  that  purpose.  In  the  late  1950s, 
precise  electro-optical  distance  ranging,  capable  of 
much  greater  accuracy  than  triangulation,  came  into 
use;  and  it  is  only  within  the  last  6  years  that  con- 
tinuous recording  of  fault  slip,  strain,  and  tilt  has  been 
employed  specifically  to  study  aseismic  crustal  move- 
ment and  earthquakes.  All  of  these  are  discussed  below. 

GEODETIC  AND  LOCAL  SURVEYS 
Geodetic  Triangulation 

Instrumental  measurement  of  crustal  movement  in 
California  began  in  1906,  when  the  U.S.  Coast  and 
Geodetic  Survey  reobserved  their  primary  trangula- 
tion  network  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  region,  which 
had  been  set  up  during  the  years  1851  to  1887.  The 
1906-07  resurvey  revealed  that  right-lateral  displace- 
ment, \\hich  occurred  at  the  time  of  the  1906  "San 
Francisco"  earthquake,  decreased  with  distance  from 
the  San  Andreas  fault.  These  data  were  thoroughly 
analyzed  by  H.  F.  Reid  (1910,  p.  16-28)  and  provided 
the  basis  for  his  elastic  rebound  theory  of  earthquake 
generation.  The  primary  net  was  reobserved  in  1922, 
and  the  results  of  this  and  the  1906-07  resurvey  formed 
the  basis  for  a  systematic  program  of  special-pattern 
surveys  to  measure  horizontal  movement  along  the 
San  Andreas  fault.  These  have  been  described  bv 
iMeade  (Meade  and  Small,  1966;  Meade,  1963,  1968, 
1970),  and  their  locations  and  data  are  briefly  sum- 
marized here  in  table  1  and  figure  2. 

Local  Triangulation 

Creep  on  the  San  Andreas  fault  was  discovered  in 
1956  when  Steinbrugge  and  Zacher  (1960)  investigated 
damage  at  the  Taylor  (also  called  "Almaden"  or 
"Cienega")  Winery,  which  sits  directly  astride  the 
fault  about  7  miles  south  of  Hollister.  Reinforced  con- 
crete walls  and  concrete  slab  floors  had  been  cracked,

and  progressive  deformation  had  thrown  some  columns 
so  far  out  of  plumb  that  they  had  been  rebuilt  in  1954. 
Subsequent!)',  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  set 
up  a  small  quadrilateral  figure  across  the  fault  on  the 
north  side  of  the  winery.  It  has  been  resurveycd  an- 
nually since  1957;  results  show  that  creep  movement 
averages  1.5  cm/yr  (Meade,  1966,  p.  387).  The  first 
creep  recorder,  which  was  installed  in  the  winery  in 
1957  (Tocher,  1960),  has  indicated  an  average  rate  of 
displacement  of  1.3  cm/yr. 


In  1960,  creep  was  reported  on  the  Hay  ward  fault 
by  Cluff  and  Steinbruggc  (Radbruch  ct  al.,  1966,  p. 
8-12),  who  found  a  building  damaged  b\'  right-lateral 
movement  on  the  fault.  Since  then,  right-lateral  offset 
of  culverts,  sidewalks,  railroad  tracks,  and  other  struc- 
tures has  been  found  all  along  the  Ha\'ward  fault  be- 
tween Berkeley  and  I-rcmont  (Radbruch  et  al.,  1966). 

Because  it  was  recognized  in  the  carh'  1960s  that 
creep  could  be  a  major  hazard  to  engineering  struc- 
tures, the  California  Department  of  Water  Resources

supported  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  in  a 
cooperative  effort  to  detect  creep  at  locations  where 
the  California  Aqueduct  would  cross  active  faults.  In 
1964  and  1965  small  quadrilateral  figures  (several  hun- 
dred meters  across)  were  set  up  at  21  aqueduct-fault 
crossing  sites  (figure  3).  Most  have  been  resurveyed 
annually  or  biannually  since  then.  The  sites  are  on  the 
San  Andreas,  Hayward,  Calaveras,  Sunol,  Pleasanton, 


Nacimiento,  White  Wolf,  San  Jacinto,  and  Cleghom 
faults.  Creep  has  been  measured  at  sites  on  the  first 
five  faults  named  above  in  the  greater  San  Francisco 
Bay  region.  At  the  other  crossing  sites,  measurements 
lie  within  the  range  of  probable  error. 

Beginning  in  1966,  the  Seismological  Laboratory 
of  the  California  Institute  of  Technology  established  a 
number  of  fault-crossing  angulation  nets  with  a  maxi- 


168

nniin  dimension  of  about  400  ni.  In  these  nets,  lateral- 
fault  displacement  is  determined  hv  monitoring  an- 
gular ciiangcs  between  lines  radiating  from  a  point 
on  one  sitie  of  the  fault  to  several  points  on  the  other. 
These  nets,  now  about  38  in  number,  are  chiefly  in 
southern  California  south  of  the  Transverse  Ranges 
and  on  the  San  Andreas,  San  Jacinto,  Coyote  Creek, 
and  Imperial  faults;  there  arc  also  several  on  the 
central  San  Andreas  fault  (Clarence  .\llen,  1971, 
personal  communication)  (see  figure  1  for  fault  loca- 
tion). Nets  on  the  central  San  Andreas  fault  have  been

surveyed  as  man\-  as  40  times;  on  the  Imperial  and 
Coyote  Creek  faults,  1 2  times;  and  on  others,  from  one 
to  nine  times.  In  the  Imperial  Valley  region,  Hilcman 
et  al.  (1971)  reported:  "definite  or  suspected  move- 
ments have  been  observed  along  parts  of  the  San 
Jacinto,  Coyote  Creek,  Superstition  Hills,  Imperial, 
and  San  Andreas  faults;  no  movement  has  been  de- 
tected along  the  Elsinore  and  Superstition  Mountain 
faults  or  along  the  San  .•\ndreas-Banning-Mission  Creek 
fault  system  northwest  of  Alecca  Hills". 

Electro-Optical  Distance  Ranging 

When  construction  of  facilities  of  the  California 
State  Water  Project  began  in  the  late  1950s,  the  De- 
partment of  Water  Resources'  Consulting  Board  for 
Earthquake  Analysis  recommended  a  program  to  meas- 
ure rates  of  crustal  movement  in  the  neighborhood  of 
active  faults.  Survey  lines  crisscrossing  faults  of  the 
San    .Andreas   svstcm    from    San    Francisco    to    Palm 


Springs  were  established  (figure  4).  The  work  con- 
sisted almost  cntirel\-  of  repeated  measurements  of  the 
lengths  of  these  lines  by  Geodimeter  (sec  glossary). 
Progress  of  the  project  to  earh-  1968  has  been  described 
by  Hoffman  a  al.  (1968).  In  1968,  the  California  Divi- 
sion of  Mines  and  Geology  assumed  responsibility  for 
the  geodimeter  program  and  considerabl\-  augmented 
the  original  survey  scheme,  adding  a  number  of  closed 
figures  as  well  as  "crisscross"  lines  (Greensfeldcr  and 
Crice,  1971,  p.  109). 

Distances  can  be  determined  by  geodimeter  to  an 
accuracy  of  about  ten  times  that  of  first-order  triangu- 
lation, which  is  normalh-  accurate  to  about  10  ppm 
(see  glossary).  This  means  that  crustal  movement  can 
be  detected  in  one-tenth  the  time  period  (reobscrva- 
tion  interval)  required  by  triangulation  methods. 

Measurements  on  more  than  100  lines  have  been 
made  annually  or  as  frcquentl&gt;-  as  possible  since  1959. 
Most  of  these  lines  cross  faults  at  angles  smaller  than 
30  degrees  and  are  therefore  particularl\-  useful  for 
detecting  strike-slip  movement.  In  the  following  dis- 
cussion, the  term  "movement"  is  used  in  describing 
the  geodimeter  data,  because  these  data  actuallv  express 
the  combined  displacements  attributable  to  both  fault

line  lengths  is  nnicli  grciitcr  where  f;iult  creep  occurs 
than  where  it  docs  not.  In  other  words,  in  the  zone — 
gcner;ill\-  about  10  km  wide  and  centered  on  a  fault 
trace — occupied  by  the  geoilinieter  lines,  displacement 
of  points  on  one  side  of  the  fault  trace  relative  to  points 
on  the  other,  and  hence  the  change  in  length  of  lines 
connecting  those  opposing  points,  is  much  greater 
where  fault  slip  occurs  than  where  it  does  not,  over 
a  period  of  10  or  so  &gt;'cars.  If  below  some  depth,  per- 
haps about  20  km,  tectonic  plates  are  moving  more 
or  less  as  rigid  units,  then  the  above  results  implv  that, 
where  faults  are  "locked"  (that  is,  not  creeping), 
significant  strain  must  be  accumulating  outside  the 
zone  crossed  by  the  geodimcter  lines. 

The  greatest  average  movement  rates  detected 
over  the  past  decade  were  along  the  San  Andreas  fault 
between  the  Pinnacles  and  Parkficld.  In  this  region, 
movement  has  been  relati\el\-  uniform  at  a  rate  of 
about  }  to  }'/:  cni/\r.  Bevond  this  segment  of  the 
fault,  movement  dies  off  to  essentially  zero  near  Wat- 
sonvillc  on  the  north  and  near  Cholame  on  the  south 
(figure  4). 

Gcodimeter  lines  crossing  the  Hayward  fault  in- 
dicate right-lateral  movement  averaging  1 '/;  cm/yr, 
and  comparable  motion  appears  on  the  Calaveras  fault 
south  of  its  junction  with  the  Hayward  fault  about  6 
miles  south  of  Mt.  Hamilton.  North  of  this  point,  how- 
ever, movement  on  the  Cala\'eras  fault  dies  off  to  near 
zero  between  Mt.  Hamilton  and  Mt.  Diablo.  Thus  it 
appears  that  some  movement  on  the  San  Andreas  fault 
south  of  HoUister  is  transferred  to  the  Calaveras  fault, 
and  this  in  turn  is  shifted  to  the  Hayward  fault. 

In  the  Santa  Clara  Valley  and  Hollister  region 
and  in  the  Cholame  Valley  area,  the  lengths  of  the 
geodimeter  lines  have  changed  in  an  erratic  fashion. 
These  changes,  however,  can  be  correlated  with  local 
earthquakes  (Hoffman  et  al.,  1968;  Greensfelder  and 
Crice,  1971).  Along  the  Carrizo  Plain-San  Bernardino 
segment  of  the  San  Andreas  fault,  the  data  indicate  no 
fault  slip  and  only  slight  strain  accumulation;  the  strain 
is  observed  in  the  San  Bernardino  region,  across  the 
San  Andreas  and  San  Jacinto  fault  zones,  and  takes  the 
form  of  north-south  compression  at  a  rate  of  around 
Vz  ppm/yr  (Hoffman  et  al.,  1968,  p.  69). 

In  a  recent  review  of  the  data  gathered  by  the 
State's  geodimeter  program,  the  California  Division  of 
Mines  and  Geology  has  found  strong  evidence  for  a 
cyclical  variation  of  dilatational  (see  glossary)  .strain 
\\  ith  amplitude  of  2  to  3  ppm  and  period  of  7  to  8 
years.  This  effect  appears  to  be  synchronous  from 
San  Francisco  to  San  Bernardino,  and  appears  as  a 
periodic  change  of  length  on  man\-  lines.  Because  of 
the  relative  infrequenc\'  of  observation,  the  effect  is 
clearly  discernible  onl\'  on  lines  which  are  not  dis- 
turbed by  the  much  larger  effect  of  fault  slip. 

Other  organizations  have  begun  to  apply  electro- 
optical  ranging  to  the  measurement  of  crustal  move- 
ment. The  National  Center  for  Earthquake  Research 
of  the  U.S.  Geological  Surve&gt;'  began  its  monitoring 
program  in  1965  and  In-  1970  had  established  eight 
small  nets  from  the  San  I'"rancisco  Ba\'  Area  to  the 
Hollister  region:   seven  across  the  San  Andreas  fault 


and  one  across  the  Calaveras  fault.  Until  recently  four 
of  these  were  monitored  fortnightl\',  and  the  others, 
annuall&gt;-.  In  1970,  the  NCER  triangulated  and  trilat- 
erated  (see  glossary)  most  of  the  Salinas-Hollister  net- 
work, which  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey 
triangulated  in  1930,  1951,  and  1962.  The  1970  data 
are  consistent  with  those  of  the  earlier  surveys,  indi- 
cating continued  combined  right-lateral  motion  of  2 '/I 
cm/_\r  across  the  San  Andreas,  Sargent,  and  Cala- 
veras faults.  In  1971,  this  network  was  extended  to 
Gilroy. 

In  1969  the  National  Ocean  Survey,  formerly  the 
U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Surve\-,  began  trilateration 
using  a  geodimeter  when  a  special  purpose  survey  was 
set  up  in  the  Anza-Borrego  Desert  area,  in  connection 
with  the  1968  Borrego  Mountain  earthquake.  In  the 
same  \ear,  the  National  Ocean  Survey  trilaterated  the 
Fort  Ross  net  and  established  a  trilateration  net  in  the 
Bodega  Bay  area.  In  1970,  a  trilateration  net  was 
established  in  the  Stone  Canyon  area,  about  16  miles 
southeast  of  Hollister. 

The  Geology  Department  of  the  Universitv'  of 
California,  Santa  Barbara,  established  a  trilateration  net 
across  the  Santa  Barbara  Channel,  an  area  of  high  seis- 
micity,  in  1970-71.  This  net  will  probably  be  remeas- 
ured  in  about  5  years.  In  1970,  the  Department  of 
Geological  Sciences  at  the  University  of  California, 
Riverside,  in  cooperation  with  Imperial  College,  Lon- 
don, set  up  a  long  trilateration  arc  (see  glossary) 
across  the  Imperial  fault;  the  arc  was  remeasured  twice 
in  1971,  but  results  have  not  yet  been  published. 

Leveling 

The  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  began  level- 
ing work  in  California  in  1906,  and  about  30,000  miles 
of  first-order  and  20,000  miles  of  second-order  leveling 
and  releveling  had  been  completed  by  1966  (Meade 
and  Small,  1966,  p.  390).  The  most  intensive  releveling 
has  been  and  continues  to  be  in  the  San  Joaquin  Valley 
area,  where  rapid  subsidence  due  largely  to  ground 
water  withdrawal  poses  a  continuing  hazard  to  the 
operation  of  hydraulic  systems,  particularly  the  Cali- 
fornia Aqueduct.  There  has  been  more  than  22  feet 
of  subsidence  at  one  place  in  the  San  Joaquin  Valley 
(Meade  and  Small,  1966,  p.  390). 

In  1935,  five  level  lines  were  establislied  across  the 
San  Andreas  fault  between  the  vicinity  of  Maricopa 
and  the  San  Jacinto  Mountains,  each  of  which  had 
been  releveled  from  two  to  eight  times  b\'  1966  (Meade 
and  Small,  1966,  p.  391).  These  and  other  level  data 
have  generally  been  insufficiently  analyzed  to  allow 
the  dra\ving  of  conclusions  concerning  vertical  tec- 
tonic movements.  However,  on  the  basis  of  releveling 
between  Mettler  in  the  southern  San  Joaquin  A'^alley 
and  Gorman  in  the  Tchachapi  Mountains,  Lofgren 
(1966)  concluded  that  uplift  accompan\ing  the  1952 
Kern  Count\'  earthquake  reached  a  maximum  of  nearly 
2  feet  in  the  Wheeler  Ridge  area.  He  also  concluded 
that  vertical  tectonic  movement  has  continued  in  the 
Tchachapi  Mountains  since  1952.  This  continuing 
movement   has   an   cast-west   axis  of   flexure   about   2

miles  south  of  Grapevine;  however,  absolute  vertical 
movement  is  unknown. 

Several  short  level  lines  were  set  up  across  the 
San  Andreas  fault  on  the  San  Francisco  Peninsula  by 
the  National  Center  for  Earthquake  Research  in  1968. 
In  1969,  the  center  established  several  "tilt  arrays" — 
actually  very  small  leveling  arrays — on  the  Calaveras, 
San  Andreas,  and  Coyote  Creek  faults.  The  Geology 
Department  of  the  University  of  California,  Santa 
Barbara,  set  up  seven  fault-crossing  level  lines  in  the 
vicinity  of  Santa  Barbara  and  four  such  lines  in  Death 
Valley  in  1970.  Significant  vertical  movement  has  not 
been  reported  on  any  of  these. 

ALIGNMENT  ARRAYS  AND  CREEPMETERS 

Since  1964,  about  60  creepmeters  (see  glossary) 
and  58  alignment  arrays  (see  glossary)  have  been  put 
into  operation  by  the  Earthquake  Mechanism  Labora- 
tory of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Ad- 
ministration and  the  National  Center  for  Earthquake 
Research  of  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey.  Most  of 
these  are  located  on  the  San  Andreas  and  Hay%vard 
faults.  Creepmeters  and  alignments  are  frequently 
located  at  the  same  sites,  in  order  to  determine  what 
fraction  of  fault  slip  is  recorded  by  the  creepmeters. 

Data  from  alignment  arrays  indicate  that  most 
fault  displacement  occurs  in  a  zone  less  than  6  m  wide 
at  most  sites  (Raleigh  and  Burford,  1969,  p.  380). 
Creepmeters  have  shown  that  fault  creep  is  episodic 
at  most  sites,  the  episodes  being  called  creep  events, 
and  that  these  are  not  simultaneous  at  different  sites 
but  propagate  along  the  fault  at  apparent  rates  of  less 
than  10  km/day;  most  creep  events  involve  fault  seg- 
ments from  several  to  20  km  long  (Nason,  1971,  p.  31). 

Creepmeters,  alignment  arrays,  and  offset  struc- 
tures show  that  the  maximum  slip-rate  on  the  San 
Andreas  fault  has  been  about  2.5  cm/yr  over  the  last 
60  years,  and  occurs  on  the  segment  between  Bear 
Valley,  north  of  San  Benito,  and  Middle  Mountain, 
north  of  Parkfield,  a  distance  of  about  90  km  (see 
figure  1  for  locations).  Northward  from  Bear  Valley, 
total  slip  since  1906  dies  out  to  zero  apparently  near 
Watsonville  (Nason,  1971,  p.  12);  southward  from 
Middle  Mountain,  total  slip  for  the  last  40  years  drops 
to  zero  a  short  distance  south  of  Cholame  (Brown  and 
Wallace,  1968,  p.  30-33).  Slippage  on  the  most  active 
central  segment  is  predominantly  aseismic;  however, 
a  significant  fraction  of  slippage  on  the  end-segments 
may  have  occurred  during  moderate-magnitude 
(M  =  4-6)  earthquakes.  The  fact  that  the  crustal 
movement  rate  determined  from  triangulation  and 
geodimeter  measurements  along  the  Bear  Valley- 
Middle  Mountain  segment  is  Yi  to  1  cm/yr  greater 
than  the  creep  rate  suggests  that  right  lateral  strain  is 
accumulating  there. 

Active  slippage  has  been  observed  all  along  the 
Hayward  fault,  from  San  Pablo  to  Fremont,  at  rates 
of  0.5  to  0.7  cm/yr.  On  the  Calaveras  fault,  slippage 
decreases  from  1.2  cm/yr  at  Anderson  Reservoir  (20 
km  south  of  Mt.  Hamilton)  to  0.6  cm/yr  in  Hollister; 
north  of  Mt.  Hamilton,  little,  if  any,  slip  is  occurring 
(Nason,  1971,  p.  14-16). 


STRAIN  METERS 

The  quartz-rod  strain  meter  (see  glossary)  was 
designed  by  Hugo  Benioff  (1959,  p.  1019-1032)  for 
secular  (that  is,  long-term  trend),  tidal,  and  .seismic 
strain  measurements.  This  instrument  was  first  installed 
at  Dalton,  about  33  km  NW  of  Pasadena,  in  1953; 
since  then,  similar  instruments  have  been  installed  at 
Mr.  Palomar  (1954),  Lake  Isabella  (1957),  and  Pasa- 
dena (1959).  These  instruments  have  an  intrinsic  strain 
sensitivity  approaching  lO"'";  however,  usejul  sensi- 
tivity in  the  ultra-long  period  range,  from  1  day  to  1 
year  and  greater,  is  limited  to  appro.ximately  lO''^  by 
background  noise  caused  chiefly  by  thermally  and 
barometrically  induced  strains,  both  in  the  ground 
and  directly  in  the  instrument,  as  well  as  by  fluctua- 
tions in  ground  water  levels. 

A  quartz-rod  strain  meter  was  installed  in  1967 
at  Earthquake  Mechanism  Laboratory's  Stone  Canyon 
Observatory  30  km  south  of  Hollister.  The  Seismo- 
graphic  Station  of  the  University  of  California,  Berke- 
ley, established  its  San  Andreas  Geoph\sical  Observa- 
tory on  the  Harris  Ranch  about  a  mile  north  of  the 
Almaden  Winery  in  1968;  a  quartz-rod  strain  meter  is 
included  in  its  complement  of  instruments. 

The  Institute  of  Geophysics  and  Planetary  Physics 
of  the  University  of  California,  San  Diego,  has  de- 
signed, built,  and  recently  installed  r^vo  laser-inter- 
ferometer strain  meters  which  operate  over  an  800- 
meter  base  above  ground  level.  These  instruments  have 
a  sensitivity  of  10"^",  and  flat  response  from  0  to  1 
megacycle/second.  One  of  the  strain  meters  is  located 
at  Camp  Elliot,  near  San  Diego;  and  the  other,  at 
Pinyon  Flat,  in  the  Santa  Rosa  Mountains. 

The  instruments  described  above  have  not  yet 
provided  significant  information  on  secular  strain 
changes,  although  they  have  been  quite  useful  in  the 
study  of  very  long-period  surface  waves. 

TIITMETERS 

Seven  "permanent"  tiltmeter  (see  glossary)  sta- 
tions are  currently-  in  operation  in  California.  The  first 
was  installed  at  Lake  Isabella  in  1964  by  the  California 
Institute  of  Technology;  the  Earthquake  Mechanism 
Laboratory  installed  a  tiltmeter  at  Stone  Canyon  in 
1966  and  more  recently,  installed  a  similar  instrument 
near  the  Buena  Vista  fault.  During  1969-71,  the  Na- 
tional Center  for  Earthquake  Research  installed  four 
two-component  mercury  tiltmeters:  at  San  Francisco, 
Berkele\',  Mt.  Hamilton,  and  Fremont  Peak  (13  km 
southwest  of  Hollister). 

Anomalous  tilt  events  have  been  observed  prior  to 
earthquakes  in  Japan,  where  tiltmeters  have  been  op- 
erated for  many  years.  Rapid  accelerations  in  ground 
tilting,  beginning  several  hours  before  earthquakes  of 
magnitude  4'/2-j-'  were  observed  during  the  1966 
Matsushiro  earthquake  s\\  arm  (Hagiwara  and  Rikitake, 
1967,  p.  765). 

The  Danville  earthquakes  (M  =  4.0)  of  June  11 
and  12,  1970,  located  on  the  Calaveras  fault  zone  about 
25  km  east  of  Oakland,  were  preceded  by  tilting 
which  began  29  hours  before  the  first  shock  as  re-

corded  on  the  Berkeley  and  San  Francisco  Presidio 
instruments  operated  bv  the  National  Center  for 
larthquakc  Research  (Wood  ct  nl.,  1971).  At  -29 
hours,  the  tilt-vector  on  the  Berkeley  instrument,  which 
had  been  pointing  down  and  parallel  to  the  Hayward 
fault,  began  to  swing  around  toward  the  Danville 
earthquakes'  epicenter.  B\-  -13  hours,  the  vector  had 
"locked"  in  the  direction  of  the  epicenter,  where  it 
remained  until  after  the  .second  shock,  when  it  swung 
back  parallel  to  the  fault,  but  now  180  degrees  from 
its  initial  azimutli.  These  data  suggest  that  tiltmeters 
may  be  a  key  element  in  an  earthquake  warning  system. 

EARTHQUAKES  AND  CRUSTAL  MOVEMENT 
Accumulation  of  Strain 

Controversy  has  arisen  over  the  suggestion  that 
fault  slip  due  to  creep  and  small  earthquakes  in  the  cen- 


tral portion  of  the  San  .Andreas  fault  system  (that  is, 
Hollister  to  Parkficld)  acts  as  an  effective  "safety 
valve"  preventing  the  accumulation  of  strain  in  that 
region.  In  1968  C.  R.  Allen  (1968,  p.  77)  hypothesized 
that  strain  release  on  each  of  five  segments  of  the  sys- 
tem is  characterized  by  one  of  r\vo  basic  modes  of 
seismic  and  creep  behavior.  One  mode  shows  frequent 
small-to-large  earthquakes  (up  to  Richter  magnitude 
7 '/; )  and  creep  and  is  common  to  the  northern,  central, 
and  southern  "active"  areas  (figure  5);  the  other  mode 
is  characterized  by  infrequent  great  earthquakes  (mag- 
nitude 8-|-),  few  small-to-largc  shocks,  and  no  meas- 
urable creep  and  is  common  to  the  200-plus-mile  seg- 
ments which  ruptured  during  the  great  1857  (Fort 
Tejon)  and  1906  (San  Francisco)  earthquakes. 

In  analyzing  geodimeter  and  triangulation  data, 
Scholz  and  Fitch  (1969,  p.  6663)  concluded  that  strain 
is  accumulating  everywhere  along  the   San   Andreas

fault  at  a  rate  of  about  1  ppm/yr  and  that  fault  slip 
due  to  creep  and  minor  seismicity  "do  not  release  an 
appreciable  amount  of  the  accumulating  strain  and 
hence  do  not  serve  as  a  safety  valve  to  prevent  major 
earthquakes  as  Allen  (1968)  has  suggested."  In  a  later 
paper  the  same  authors  (Scholz  and  Fitch,  1970)  find 
that  meanired  creep  on  the  San  Andreas,  Hayward, 
and  Calaveras  faults  can  account  for  only  one-third  of 
the  geodimeter  line  changes  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay 
Area-to-San  Benito  region;  and,  if  there  is  no  unde- 
tected creep,  then  principal  strain  rates  must  be  about 
'/2  ppm/yr.  They  then  explore  the  possibility  that  un- 
detected creep  on  minor  faults  can  explain  the  geo- 
dimeter data.  By  postulating  undetected  creep  at  rates 
of  1.0,  1.0,  and  2.0  cm/yr  on  the  Sargent,  Silver  Creek, 
and  Paicines  faults  respectively  and  assuming  that 
creep  on  all  faults  extends  to  great  depth  (perhaps 
100  km),  the  geodimeter  results  can  be  accounted  for 
with  no  accumulation  of  strain.  Scholz  and  Fitch 
(1970,  p.  4447)  point  out  that  measurements  of  creep 
on  these  minor  faults  must  be  made  before  we  can 
predict  seismic  risk  in  the  region. 

Savage  and  Burford  (1970)  have  made  a  thorough 
analytical  review  of  triangulation  data  from  five  tec- 
tonically  active  areas  of  California:  Hollister,  Cholame, 
Santa  Barbara  Channel,  Owens  Valley,  and  Imperial 
Valley.  They  found  no  evidence  for  strain  accumula- 
tion in  the  Hollister,  Santa  Barbara  Channel,  and 
Owens  Valley  areas  for  the  periods  1930-62,  1880- 
1923,  and  1934-56  respectively.  Near  Cholame,  accu- 
mulation of  shear  strain  along  the  San  Andreas  fault 
from  1932  to  1962  appears  to  have  been  directly  caused 
by  slip  a  few  miles  to  the  north  accompanying  the 
1934  Parkfield  earthquake;  no  significant  strain  accu- 
mulation occurred  there  from  1951  to  1962.  In  Impe- 
rial Valley,  however,  the\'  found  an  average  accumula- 
tion of  0.4  ppm/yr  right-lateral  shear  strain  parallel 
to  the  Imperial  fault  and  extending  over  a  zone  perhaps 
100  km  wide. 

In  their  recent  discussion  of  Scholz  and  Fitch's 
work  (1969,  1970),  Savage  and  Burford  (1971)  reiter- 
ated their  view  that  fault  slip  accounts  for  the  geodetic 
observations  of  crustal  movement  on  the  San  Andreas 
fault  between  San  Juan  Bautista  and  Cholame.  They 
cite  both  recent  fault-creep  observations  and  apparent 
rigid  behavior  of  the  crustal  blocks  flanking  this  sec- 
tion of  the  fault.  Similarly,  they  show  that  the  geodi- 
meter lines  crossing  the  Hayward  and  Calaveras  faults 
are  compatible  with  right-lateral  movement  at  the 
higher  creep  rates  recently  observed  on  these  faults. 
In  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area,  the  geodimeter  and 
triangulation  data  do  not  prove  that  strain  is  accumu- 
lating there;  according  to  Savage  (1971,  p.  815),  ".  .  . 
sensible  strain  accumulation  obtains  only  within  a  zone 
extending  a  few  kilometers  on  either  side  of  the  major 
faults,  and,  consequently,  strain  accumulation  is  not 
easily  distinguished  from  fault  creep."  Nason  (1971, 
p.  191)  concurred  in  these  findings,  saying  that  ".  .  . 
the  geodimeter  measurements  do  not  indicate  a  large 
elastic  strain  accumulation  of  the  type  suggested  by 
Scholz  and  Fitch  (1969,  1970)." 


Earthquake  Warning  vs.  Earthquake  Prediction 

To  "predict"  means  to  tell  or  declare  beforehand; 
foretell;  prophesy.  To  "warn"  means  to  caution  or 
notify  of  possible  danger  or  risk,  and  so  a  warning 
does  not  connote  the  certainty  of  a  prediction.  Earth- 
quake prediction  may  not  be  possible  for  many  years, 
because  of  the  many  physical  parameters  which  would 
have  to  be  accurately  monitored  to  provide  sufficient 
information  for  prediction.  These  parameters  include 
stress,  strain,  temperature,  water  content,  and  detailed 
mechanical  properties  (viscoelastic  constants)  in  and 
of  the  rocks  at  great  depths  (up  to  15  km  or  more) 
in  the  earth's  crust.  All  of  these  can  now  be  measured 
on  the  surface  or  at  shallow  depths  (up  to  about  1 
or  2  km);  however  subsurface  measurements  are  ex- 
tremely expensive  and  not  presently  feasible  at  depths 
greater  than  perhaps  5  km.  Even  an  adequate  near- 
surface  measurement  program  would  cost  many  mil- 
lions of  dollars  annually. 

Earthquake  warning,  however,  may  be  closer  at 
hand.  Field  observations,  laboratory  experiments,  and 
theory  all  indicate  that  anomalous  earth  deformation 
may  be  detectable  prior  to  the  occurrence  of  earth- 
quakes, at  least  shallow-focus  earthquakes.  In  Califor- 
nia, data  from  recently  established  very  dense  perma- 
nent and  temporary  seismograph  networks  have  shown 
that  earthquakes  occurring  in  the  San  Andreas  fault 
system  have  focal  depths  no  greater  than  15  km.  This 
suggests  that  above  1 5  km  the  crust  is  relatively  brittle 
(assuming  earthquakes  occur  by  a  process  of  brittle 
fracture)  while,  below  that  depth,  crustal  rocks  are 
relatively  plastic.  Presumably,  an  earthquake  occurs 
when  progressive  plastic  deformation  (creep)  in  the 
lower  crust  loads  the  brittle  upper  crust  to  its  breaking 
strength. 

Laboratory  experiments  in  rock  mechanics  have 
shown  that,  under  certain  conditions,  creep  in  perido- 
tite  and  dunite  may  be  unstable,  and  may  accelerate  in 
exponential  fashion;  that  is,  the  creep  rate  is  an  ex- 
ponential function  of  applied  stress  (Scholz,  1971,  p. 
lUGG  127).  In  this  fashion,  linear  accumulation  of 
strain  (hence,  stress)  in  the  near-fault  region  at  great 
depth  could  give  rise  to  accelerating  creep  on  the  fault 
itself.  This  accelerated  creep  should  be  observable  at 
the  surface  as  accelerated  strain  and  tilt. 

It  is  not  to  be  expected  that  all  such  accelerated- 
strain  events  will  be  followed  b&gt;'  a  significant  earth- 
quake. Major  (1971,  p.  154-155)  has  observed  frequent 
aseismic  strain  episodes  on  strain-meter  records  from 
the  Aleutian  Islands,  which  he  associated  with  creep 
episodes  on  a  deep  shear  zone.  However,  we  expect 
that  the  proportion  of  aseismic  versus  seismic  strain 
episodes  varies  depending  on  tectonic  regime,  and  it 
may  be  that,  in  certain  regions,  all  strain  episodes  with 
geographic  extent  and  magnitude  above  some  thresh- 
old values  should  be  considered  as  earthquake  warn- 
ings. Furthermore,  experience  may  show  that  strain 
episodes  which  are  short-term  precursors  of  earth- 
quakes have  unique  characteristics.  Hence  we  feel  that 
earthquake  warnings  with  some  useful  degree  of  reli- 
ability may  be  possible  on  an  empirical  basis,  without 
thorough  and  detailed  knowledge  of  all  geophysical 
parameters  affecting  earthquake  occurrence.

GLOSSARY  OF  TECHNICAL  TERAAS 

Alignment  array,  .^n  initially  straight  row  of  monu- 
ments set  at  right  angles  across  an  active  fault  trace; 
progressive  fault  slip  is  observed  by  repeated  observa- 
tion of  horizontal  displacement  of  these  monuments 
from  their  initial  positions  relative  to  each  other. 

Arc.  A  long,  narrow  triangulation  network,  gener- 
allv  a  chain  of  quadrilateral  survey  figures. 

Creepmeter.  A  displacement  meter  for  lueasuring 
creep.  It  actually  measures  the  change  in  distance  be- 
tween two  monuments  on  opposite  sides  of  a  fault 
trace.  Typically,  the  instrument  provides  a  continuous 
chart  recording  of  displacements. 

Dilatation.  .\  component  of  plane  strain,  equal  to 
the  change  in  area  per  unit  area.  It  ma\'  be  thought  of 
as  an  omni-directional  extension  or  contraction. 

Geodimeter.  "Geodimeter"  is  the  trade  name  for 
the  most  common  type  of  electro-optical  distance 
measuring  instrument  and  is  often  used  genetically  to 
denote  all  such  instruments.  The  instrument  is  capable 
of  measuring  distance  with  an  error  less  than  ±  1  part 
per  million;  this  amounts  to  ±1  millimeter  in  1  kilo- 
meter. 

Part(s)  per  million  (ppm).  One  part  per  million  is 
equal  to  1/1,000,000.  Fractional  error  is  commonly 
stated  in  ppm. 


Strain.  In  its  most  general  sense,  strain  is  the  de- 
formation of  a  body  due  to  stress  or  force.  As  used 
here,  strain  has  the  restricted  meaning  of  continuous 
deformation  in  a  horizontal  plane;  that  is,  plane  strain. 
Strain  is  expressed  as  a  change  in  length  per  unit  length 
in  a  given  direction;  this  quantit&gt;'  is  a  dimensionless 
number  and  is  here  stated  in  parts  per  million  (ppm). 

Strain  meter.  .An  instrument  for  measuring  strain. 
In  geophysical  applications,  the  quartz-rod  extensom- 
eter  is  most  commonly  used.  This  instrument  typically 
t)perates  over  a  base  10  to  30  m  long  and  has  a  sen- 
sitivity of  .001  part  per  million  or  better;  it  actually 
measures  change  in  distance  between  two  monuments, 
the  quartz  rod  serving  as  a  constant-length  reference. 

Tiltmeter.  .An  instrument  to  measure  change  in  the 
attitude  or  slope  of  the  local  ground  surface. 

Triangulation.  The  process  of  measuring  the  angles 
necessary  to  determine  precisely  the  positions  of  monu- 
ments in  a  trigonometric  survey;  in  this  process,  the 
earth's  surface  is  divided  into  a  series  of  triangles.  A 
transit  or  theodolite  is  the  instrument  used  to  measure 
these  angles. 

Trilateration.  The  process  of  measuring  the  lengths 
necessary  to  determine  precisely  the  positions  of  monu- 
ments in  a  trigonometric  survey.  An  electronic  or 
electro-optical  distance  ranging  instrument,  such  as  a 
Geodimeter,  is  normally  used  in  such  a  survey. 


CHAPTER    14 

Earth  Movements  from  Geodetic  Measurements^ 

by  J.  C.  Savage',  R.  O.  Burford',  and  W.  T.  Kinoshifa' 


The  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971, 
was  accompanied  by  pronounced  earth  movements  in 
the  northern  part  of  San  Fernando  Valley  along  the 
front  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Extensive  geodetic 
control  existed  over  a  part  of  this  area,  and  resurveys 
of  that  control  permit  quantitative  measure  of  the  de- 
formation produced  by  the  earthquake.  Unfortunately, 
the  pre-existing  control  is  confined  largely  to  the 
southwest  quadrant  of  the  zone  of  deformation.  Never- 
theless, changes  in  the  horizontal  and  vertical  geodetic 
control  in  the  region  affected  by  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  of  February  9,  1971,  are  consistent  with 
that  predicted  for  a  simple  dislocation  model  with  the 
following  parameters:  fault  length  along  strike  15  km; 
fault  width  (measured  down  dip)  8  km;  depth  to  top 
of  fault  0.75  km;  dip  45°N.10°E.;  reverse  slip  2  m; 
and  left  slip  2  m.  The  maximum  deformation  (2  m  up- 
lift and  2  m  left  shift)  is  concentrated  just  north  of 
the  zone  of  tectonic  rupture,  and  the  deformation  is 
reduced  to  about  a  quarter  of  its  maximum  value 
within  5  km  north  of  that  zone.  Deformation  south  of 
the  zone  of  tectonic  rupture  is  appreciably  smaller 
(less  than  0.1  m  subsidence  and  0.6  m  horizontal  dis- 
placement). Repeated  surveys  after  the  earthquake 
show  that  up  to  0.4  m  of  afterslip  occurred  in  the 
days  following  the  earthquake. 

RELATIVE  VERTICAL  MOVEMENT 
NEAR  THE  SURFACE  RUPTURES 

The  general  pattern  of  vertical  displacement  accom- 
panying the  earthquake  was  derived  by  comparing 
postearthquake  leveling  observations  with  adjusted 
elevations  based  on  surveys  completed  for  the  most 
part  during  the  period  1960-63.  However,  elevations 
based  on  1929  observations  provided  the  only  pre- 
earthqiiake  vertical  control  available  for  portions  of 
the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  area  north  of  the  surface 
ruptures.  The  pre-earthquake  control  was  compiled 
from  several  different  sources,  combining  the  results 
of  different  categories  of  leveling  (degrees  of  resolu- 
tion or  quality)  from  first  down  to  fourth  order.  The 
apparent  vertical  changes  shown  in  figures  1  and  2  arc 
thus  still  in  a  preliminary  state,  but  it  is  very  unlikel\' 
that  later  adjustments  will  appreciably  affect  the  con- 
tour pattern  shown  in  figure  2. 

The  general  features  of  the  vertical  movement  pat- 
tern (figure  2)  include  abrupt  upwarping  associated 
with  south-facing  scarps  over  a  zone  of  surface  frac- 
tures 0.3  to  1.2  km  in  width,  slight  downward  move-

ment  combined  with  minor  northward  tilt  south  of 
the  zone  of  surface  rupture,  and  pronounced  uplift 
combined  with  strong  northward  tilt  on  the  north  side 
of  the  zone.  The  maximum  uplift  just  north  of  the 
zone  of  fractures  varies  between  1  and  2.5  m  along 
distinct  segments  of  the  break,  and  the  uplift  decreases 
to  about  0.5  m  within  distances  of  2.5  to  4.5  kilometers 
north  of  the  zone  of  surface  breakage.  The  vertical 
movements  shown  are  related  to  a  reference  mark  on 
the  north  side  of  Hansen  Lake  which  probably  moved 
downward  about  0.02  m  relative  to  a  tidal  bench  mark 
in  the  San  Pedro  area. 

An  interesting  feature  evident  in  the  contour  pattern 
is  the  en  echelon  arrangement  of  distinct  segments  of 
the  zone  of  steep  upwarping,  corresponding  to  a  simi- 
lar relationship  between  the  Tujunga  and  Svlmar  seg- 
ments of  the  surface  break  (see  figure  1  for  the  loca- 
tion of  those  segments).  The  pattern  is  stepped  to  the 
north  as  the  steep  upwarp  is  traced  from  east  to  west, 
and  the  maximum  uplift  at  the  south  edge  of  the  north 
block  seems  to  decrease  abruptly  about  1  m  at  each 
northward  step.  The  east-west  trending  axis  of  maxi- 
mum uplift  from  north  of  the  Tujunga  segment  to 
north  of  the  Sylmar  segment  is  not  noticeably  shifted, 
however.  This  pattern  could  be  due  to  transfer  of  slip 
within  a  kilometer  or  so  of  the  ground  surface  from  a 
~  45°  dipping  fault  plane  onto  steeper  bedding-plane 
faults,  combined  \\ith  an  abrupt  decrease  in  total  dis- 
placement and  a  more  efficient  transfer  of  slip  onto 
steeper  planes  on  the  Sylmar  segment. 

A  north-south  oblique-slip  tear  fault  in  the  hanging- 
wall  block  connecting  the  east  end  of  the  Sylmar  seg- 
ment with  the  \\est  end  of  the  Tujunga  segment  is 
postulated  on  the  basis  of  the  pattern  of  surface  fault- 
ing and  vertical  movement.  The  possible  tear  fault 
^\'ould  have  a  vertical  slip  component  of  perhaps  2  m 
\\ith  the  east  side  up,  combined  \\ith  riglit-latcral  and 
east-west  contractional  components  of  about  the  same 
amount.  North  of  the  east  end  of  the  Sylmar  segment, 
possible  displacement  across  the  north-south"  trend 
would  be  at  maximum  only  about  half  the  value  esti- 
mated above,  representing  the  apparent  difference  in 
movement  between  the  blocks  north  of  the  Tujunga 
and  Sylmar  segments  (about  0.7  m  difference  in  up- 
lift, for  example).  This  difference  probably  dies  out 
to  the  north;  it  cannot  be  documented  in  the  area 
between  the  Veterans  Administration  Hospital  and 
Pacoima  Reservoir  (figure  2).  The  tear-fault  interpre- 
tation is  supported  by  the  presence  of  the  north-south 
trending  mountain  front  and  by  a  diffuse  north-south 
band  of  surface  fractures  tending  to  connect  the  two 
main  segments.  Changes  in  grade  along  streets  crossing 
certain  of  these  fractures  demonstrate  that  the  east

The  possible  northward  swing  of  tiic  0.5  ni  contour 
in  the  area  east  of  Pacoinia  Reservoir  is  probablv  due 
to  pre-carthquake  uplift  subsequent  to  the  1929  level- 
ing along  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  combined  with  up- 
lift associated  with  the  earthquake.  A  qualitative  elastic 
rebound  model  illustrated  as  a  set  of  vertical  displace- 
ment profiles  in  figure  3  shows  the  effect  of  comparing 
postearthquake  levels  with  leveling  data  obtained  at 
various  pre-earthquake  times.  The  older  the  pre-carth- 
quake observation,  the  more  secular  uplift  due  to  grad- 
ual clastic  loading  will  be  included  \vith  the  changes 
due  to  elastic  rebound  during  the  earthquake. 

Profiles  of  vertical  deformation  constructed  from 
the  contours  along  the  lines  A-A'  and  B-B'  shown  in 
figure  2  are  presented  in  parts  .\  and  B  of  figure  4. 
These  profiles  illustrate  clearl\-  the  contrasts  in  vertical 
movement  and  tilt  between  the  north  and  south  blocks 
as  well  as  the  differences  in  uplift  and  tilt  between  the 
blocks  north  f)f  the  Sylmar  and  Tujunga  segments. 
The  suggestion  that  the  vertical  uplift  may  have  been 
sharply  accentuated  just  north  of  the  zone  of  surface 
fractures  b\-  transfer  of  slip  onto  steeper  splay  faults 
off  the  main  slip  plane  is  also  illustrated.  As\nimetry 
in  vertical  deformation  across  the  fault  trace  is  pre- 
sumably due  to  lack  of  constraint  on  the  hanging  wall 


block  as  the  break  propagated  toward  the  surface 
rather  than  to  lack  of  a  downward  slip  component  on 
the  footwall  block. 

Appreciable  vertical  uplift  along  Placerita  Canyon 
Road  and  Sand  Canyon  Road  in  an  area  about  4  km 
west  of  the  main-shock  epicenter  (about  10  km  north 
of  the  Sylmar  segment)  was  disclosed  by  comparison 
of  postearthquake  unadjusted  elevations  with  pre- 
carthquake  constrained  elevations  (1970  adjustment) 
for  which  the  bulk  of  observations  were  com- 
pleted during  the  period  1963-69  (figure  1). 
Preliminary  values  of  uplift  in  the  area  vary  between 
-f-  0.110  and  +  0.296  m  relative  to  a  tidal  bench  mark 
in  the  vicinity  of  San  Pedro.  The  uplift  changes 
abruptl\-  from  about  +  0.1  m  to  about  -j-  0.3  m  from 
west  to  east  at  the  intersection  of  the  two  roads,  a 
possible  indication  of  an  upw arp  o\erlying  the  north- 
west edge  of  the  buried  slip  plane.  Uplift  values  from 
this  area  arc  not  included  on  the  profiles  of  observed 
vertical  displacement  (profiles  .\-.V  and  B-B'  of  figure 
4),  although  a  northward  extrapolation  of  the  trend  in 
tilt  at  the  north  end  of  profile  A-.^'  predicts  about 
-f  0.25  m  for  the  area. 

There  is  ample  evidence  that  stations  quite  remote 
from  the  cpiccntral  region  toward  the  northwest  also 
were  uplifted  during  the  period  196S-197I  by  as  much 
as  -f  0.08  to  -j-O.ll  111  (Ellingwood  and  Williamson,

1971,  pp.  1.'&gt;1-152).  These  changes  are  not  unusual 
within  the  Transverse  Ranges  Province  and  suggest 
that  the  uplift  indicated  in  Placerita  Canyon  and  Sand 
Canyon  probabl\'  cannot  be  attributed  solely  to  earth- 
quake-associated deformation. 

The  ~  350  microradian  northward  tilt  on  the  sur- 
face of  the  hanging-wall  block  north  of  the  Sylmar 
segment  of  the  surface  break  was  confirmed  by  inde- 
pendent pre-  and  postearthquake  leveling  data  along 
the  Wilson  Drainage  Channel  bet\\'een  Pacoima  Wash 
Channel  and  Wilson  Debris  Basin  just  north  of  Olive 
View  Hospital.  These  data  were  furnished  by  the  Los 
Angeles  office  of  the  District  Engineer,  U.S.  Army 
Corps  of  Engineers. 

CHANCES  IN  HORIZONTAL  CONTROL 
The  area  affected  by  the  San  Fernando  earthquake 
was  covered  by  a  relatively  dense  network  of  triangu- 
lation  most  of  which  was  established  within  a  fe\\- 
years  of  1935.  After  the  earthquake,  36  lines  (figure  5) 
connecting  16  stations  (see  table  1  for  identification 
of  stations  and  abbreviations  used  in  this  paper)  were 
remeasured  using  a  Geodolite,  a  precise  electro-optical 
distance-measuring  device.  A  comparison  of  the  two 
survevs  showed  that  the   distances  bet\veen  stations 


changed  as  shown  in  table  2.  The  accuracy  of  the  dis- 
tances deduced  from  the  pre-earthquake  survey  is 
about  10  ppm.  The  accuracy  of  the  postearthquake 
survey  is  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude  better.  Thus, 
the  uncertainty  in  the  changes  in  line  length  shown  in 
table  2  should  be  about  10  ppm. 

The  zone  of  tectonic  rupture,  which  presumably 
represents  the  fault  trace,  is  also  sketched  in  figure  5. 
Comparison  of  figure  5  and  table  2  shows  that  lines 
which  cross  the  zone  of  tectonic  rupture  at  a  high 
angle  (for  example,  PLl  to  P2,  TUJ  R.Ml  to  6P10, 
SF8  to  P2)  tend  to  be  shortened  by  the  earthquake, 
suggesting  reverse  faulting.  Lines  which  cross  the  zone 
of  tectonic  rupture  at  low  angles  and  trend  X^\'  (for 
example,  6P10  to  PLl)  tend  to  be  lengthened,  whereas 
similar  lines  which  trend  NE  (for  example,  P2  to  TUJ 
RiMl)  tend  to  shorten.  These  low-angle  lines  then  sug- 
gest left-lateral  slip  on  the  fault.  A  more  detailed  dis- 
cussion of  the  horizontal  displacements  will  be  given 
in  the  following  section  where  comparison  can  be 
made  with  a  theoretical  model. 

There  is  reason  to  believe  that  some  of  the  changes 
in  line  lengths  ma&gt;-  be  due  to  surficial  land  motions 
which  are  not  tectonically  significant.  This  is  possibly 
the  case  at  PLl,  a  station  located  on  a  hilltop  traversed

slip  on  the  deepest  sections  of  the  fault  (the  solid  fault  line  which  ex- 
fends  to  indeterminate  depth  in  the  figure).  The  sudden  deformation

by  large  cracks.  These  cracks  arc  clearly  associated 
witii  dew n-slope  movements  of  large  masses  of  earth, 
but  because  of  the  complcxit\'  of  the  crack  distribu- 
tion, it  is  not  possible  to  be  certain  of  the  direction  in 
\\ hich  the  liilltop  was  carried,  if  indeed  it  was  moved. 
A  second  example  is  station  MES.\  located  on  the 
south  end  of  a  ridge  which  breaks  off  sharply  to  the 
soutii  into  the  San  Fernando  \'allcy.  Several  large  east- 
west  cracks  cut  the  ridge  witiiin  100  m  north  of  the 
station  suggesting  down-slope  motion  to  the  south. 
Landslide  motion  near  PLl  and  MESA  has  been 
mapped  by  Morton  (1971;  see  his  figures  4 A  and  4B), 
but  those  slides  would  not  ha\c  shifted  the  station 
marks.  The  ground  near  station  MAYS  2  also  exhibited 
main-  small  cracks,  and  minor  surficial  movement  is 
possible  there.  No  obvious  evidence  of  appreciable 
surficial  movement  was  detected  at  the  other  stations. 

As  can  be  seen  in  figure  5,  the  postearthquakc  sur- 
veys do  not  control  the  position  of  station  FAST.  We 
have  used  the  postearthquakc  measurements  of  the 
National  Geodetic  Survey  to  calculate  changes  for 
two  additional  lines,  F.\ST  to  MISSION  (shortened 
.OKm)  and  1"..\ST  to  M.W  (shortened  .10m),  which, 
together  witli  the  line  PF.2  to  F.-\ST,  control  that 
position. 

Almost  ail  of  tiie  pre-earthquake  data  were  based 
on  surveys  completed  in  the  period  1930—40.  Three 
stations  were  surveyed  later.  Of  these  one  (PE2)  was

because  of  strain  accumulation  preceding  the  earth- 
quake; this  is  the  same  phenomenon  explained  in  figure 
3  for  vertical  motions.  However,  the  data  available  on 
pre-earthquake  strain  accumulation  (Whitten,  1971) 
suggest  that  strain  accumulation  probably  did  not  ex- 
ceed the  estimated  survey  error  (10  ppm),  and  thus 
the  effect  of  pre-earthquake  movement  after  1935  is 
not  thought  to  be  significant. 

A  DISLOCATION  MODEL  OF  FAULTING 
The  major  features  of  the  surface  deformation  pro- 
duced by  faulting  can  be  approximated  by  a  simple 
dislocation  model  in  which  the  fault  is  represented  by 
a  rectangle  of  arbitrary  dip  w  ithin  an  elastic  half  space 
(figure  6).  The  displacement  field  generated  by  im- 
posing a  constant  slip  across  that  rectangular  surface 
is  readily  calculated  from  algebraic  expressions  given 
by  Mansinha  and  Smylie  (1971).  The  advantage  of 
such  a  representation  is  that  comparison  of  the  ob- 
served surface  deformation  with  the  calculated  defor- 
mation allows  one  to  infer  the  position,  attitude,  and 
extent  of  the  fault  as  well  as  the  slip  on  the  fault. 

Figure  6  shows  the  parameters  of  fault  dip  (&amp;),  fault 
length  (2L),  fault  width  (W),  and  depth  to  the  top  of 
the  fault  surface  (h)  needed  to  describe  the  fault 
model.  In  addition,  the  position  of  the  origin  of  coor- 
dinates, the  dip  direction,  and  rvvo  components  of  slip 
(dip  slip  and  strike  slip)  must  be  specified.  Table  3 
shows  the  parameters  chosen  for  the  dislocation  model 
employed  in  this  paper.  The  fault  length  has  been 
chosen  to  match  the  length  of  the  observed  zone  of 
surface  rupture.  The  dip  was  suggested  by  the  distri- 
bution of  aftershocks.  The  other  parameters  were 
chosen  to  make  the  calculated  surface  deformation  ap- 
proximate the  observed  deformation.  The  position  of

elevation  changes  across  the  dislocation  model  is  shown 
in  figure  4C;  this  profile  can  be  compared  directly 
with  the  observed  profiles  in  figures  4A  and  4B.  These 
comparisons  show  that  although  the  dislocation  model 
reproduces  the  gross  features  of  the  deformation,  the 
details  are  not  well  modeled  (for  example,  maximum 
observed  uplift  exceeds  2  m,  but  the  maximum  pre-

dieted  uplift  is  1.2  m).  A  better  fit  could  be  obtained 
by  increasing  the  reverse  component  of  slip  and  also 
the  dip  in  the  dislocation  model.  However,  we  have 
chosen  not  to  make  those  changes  because  \\c  believe 
the  discrepancies  between  observation  and  model  are 
due  to  the  greater  complexity  in  faulting  as  the  fault 
plane  approaches  the  free  surface.  As  shown  in  figures 
4A  and  4B,  subsidiary  faults,  dipping  more  steeply 
than  the  main  fault,  are  thought  to  carry  the  slip  from 
the  top  of  the  main  thrust  plane  to  the  free  surface. 
Geological  evidence  for  these  subsidiary  faults  is  cited 
by  Sharp  (this  Bulletin).  The  zone  of  tectonic  rupture 
is  then  the  trace  of  the  subsidiary  faults  on  the  free 
surface.  It  is  clear  that  such  steeply  dipping  faults  will 
enhance  the  vertical  uplift  near  the  toe  of  the  thrust. 
The  results  of  a  simple  dislocation  calculation  modeling 
this  effect  are  shown  in  figure  8,  \\  hich  represents  a

subsidiary  fault  (dip  65 °N.  10°E.,  width  0.83  km, 
length  15  km,  2  m  reverse  slip,  2  m  left  slip)  which 
joins  the  top  of  the  main  fault  to  the  surface.  The 
effect  of  the  subsidiary  fault  is  to  increase  the  maxi- 
mum uplift  and  tilt  of  the  northern  block  very  appre- 
ciably. Thus  we  suggest  that  the  overall  fit  in  figure  7 
could  be  improved  by  introducing  an  imbricate  struc- 
ture near  the  toe  of  the  thrust. 

It  is  reasonable  to  e.xpect  that  the  focus  of  the  main 
shock  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  \\ould  lie  on 
the  fault  plane.  Yet  it  is  clear  from  figure  7A  that  our 
model  fault  does  not  fulfill  this  expectation.  In  fact, 
the  model  fault  would  have  to  be  almost  twice  as  wide 
to  reach  the  focus  A\hich  lies  at  a  depth  of  about  13 
km  and  at  a  distance  of  13  km  N  of  the  zone  of  tec- 
tonic rupture.  Figure  4D  shows  a  north-south  profile 
of  the  vertical  deformation  expected  for  a  fault  of 
sufficient  width  to  reach  the  earthquake  focus.  It  is 
clear  that  the  narrow  fault  model  (figure  4C)  is  the 
better  fit  to  the  observed  deformation;  the  wider  fault 
model  requires  a  more  extensive  north-south  distribu- 
tion of  vertical  deformation.  The  difficult)-  that  simple 
fault  models  yield  what  are  apparently  too-narrow 
fault  widths  has  been  encountered  before  (for  example. 
Savage  and  Hastie,  1969,  p.  1943)  and  appears  to  be 


associated  with  the  restriction  that  slip  on  the  model- 
fault  plane  is  constant.  It  appears  more  likely  that  slip 
decreases  down  dip  along  the  fault  surface,  approach- 
ing zero  slip  at  the  lower  end.  Inasmuch  as  the  model 
employed  makes  no  provision  for  variabilit\'  in  slip 
\\  ith  depth,  the  fault  width  must  be  reduced  to  com- 
pensate for  the  smaller  slip  at  depth. 

The  survey  data  (figure  1)  indicate  an  uplift  of 
about  0.25  m  occurred  roughly  4  km  west  of  the  epi- 
center (just  beneath  the  c  in  "epicenter"  in  figure  7A) 
in  the  period  1963-71.  As  was  discussed  earlier  it  is  not 
certain  how  much  of  this  displacement  ^\'as  associated 
with  gradual  regional  uplift  rather  than  the  sudden 
earthquake  movement.  The  dislocation  model  de- 
scribed in  table  3  yields  an  uplift  of  about  0.06  m  in 
this  area,  and  the  wider  model  of  figure  4D  yields 
about  0.40  m.  Presumably,  a  dislocation  model  with 
variable  slip  on  the  fault  plane  could  be  designed  to 
account  for  any  intermediate  uplift  in  this  area. 

Figure  7B  shows  the  horizontal  surface  displacement 
predicted  b&gt;'  the  model  fault  of  table  3.  Also  shown 
in  that  figure  are  the  horizontal  displacements  of  the

course,  yields  only  the  relative  displacements  of  the 
stations,  and  an&gt;-  rigid-body  motion  (translation  and 
rotation)  ma&gt;'  be  applied  to  the  net  as  a  whole  without 
changing  the  relative  displacements.  We  have  selected 
the  rigid-body  motion  to  give  what  appears  to  be  the 
best  fit  to  the  displacement  field  calculated  from  the 
dislocation  model.  This  choice  turned  out  to  be  essen- 
tialh'  equivalent  to  liolding  the  position  of  SISTER 
ELSIF  and  the  azimuth  SISTER  ELSIE  to  PE2  fixed. 
AV'e  emphasize,  how  ever,  that  this  choice  was  not  arbi- 
trary but  rather  the  consequence  of  a  fitting  procedure. 
The  displacements  calculated  from  the  dislocation 
mode!  are  in  qualitative  agreement  with  the  displace- 
ments inferred  from  the  surve\'s,  but  the  quantitative 
fit  is  not  good.  The  largest  discrepancy,  that  at  PLl, 
may  be  due  in  part  to  surficia!  down-slope  movement 
at  that  station  as  was  discussed  in  the  preceding  section. 
However,  Burford  et  al.  (1971,  p.  84)  have  reported 
relative  horizontal  motion  of  comparable  magnitude 
(2  m)  measured  from  the  changes  in  distances  between 
street  intersections  across  the  Sylmar  segment  of  rup- 
ture (0.7  km  south  of  SI  12  in  figure  7B).  Thus,  we 
do  not  believe  the  indicated  movement  at  PLl  is  neces- 
sarily anomalous.  We  think  the  most  likely  explanation 
for  these  ratiier  large  horizontal  motions  near  the  toe 
of  the  thrust  is  that  they  are  produced  by  subsidiary 
faults.  This  explanation,  of  course,  is  the  same  as  that 
advanced  for  the  large  vertical  motions  observed  near 
the  toe  of  the  thrust  (figure  8).  Downslope  motions 
may  have  affected  MESA,  though  there  the  discrep- 
ancy is  not  so  serious.  Uncertainties  of  as  much  as  0.2 
m  in  the  displacement  of  the  triangulation  stations  on 
the  western  edge  of  the  network  relative  to  those  on 
the  eastern  edge  may  have  been  introduced  as  the  re- 
sult of  accumulation  of  errors  in  the  pre-earthquakc 
surveys;  this  may  account  in  part  for  the  anomalousl\- 
large  displacement  indicated  at  BLUFF. 

Jungels  and  Anderson  (1971)  have  reported  that  dis- 
continuities in  the  tilt  and  strain  recordings  at  Isabella 
(147  km  N.  of  the  epicenter)   and  in  strain  at  the 


University  of  California,  San  Diego,  (210  km  S.E.  of 
epicenter)  occurred  at  the  time  of  the  earthquake.  Pre- 
sumabh'  these  discontinuities  represent  permanent  de- 
formation imposed  by  the  earthquake,  and  conse- 
(juentl)'  the  magnitudes  of  those  discontinuities  can 
be  compared  with  the  permanent  strains  and  tilts  at 
those  localities  calculated  from  the  dislocation  model 
of  table  3.  The  comparison  is  shown  in  table  4.  The 
agreement  is  at  best  order  of  magnitude  onl\-,  and  in 
one  case  (N.  .38°\V^  tilt  at  Isabella)  not  even  that.  The 
sense  of  strain  (that  is,  compression  rather  than  ten- 
sion) calculated  from  the  dislocation  model  for  the 
N.  52 °F.  component  at  Isabella  is  opposite  the  observed 
offset.  The  significance  of  the  lack  of  good  agreement 
between  the  far-field  deformation  calculated  from  the 
dislocation  model  and  actualK'  observed  is  not  clear. 
The  possibility  that  the  far-field  observations  are  dis- 
torted by  local  effects  (joints  or  faults  in  the  neighbor- 
hood) cannot  be  neglected,  nor  can  the  possibility  that 
the  dislocation  model  is  inadequate  in  the  far  field  be- 
cause of  the  use  of  a  uniform  clastic  half  space  to  ap- 
proximate the  spherical  heterogeneous  earth.  All  that 
can  be  said  is  that  the  agreement  in  table  4  is  better 
than  has  been  reported  for  any  earthquake  in  the  past.

tation of  the  average  properties  of  the  faulting  asso-

ciated  with  the  San  Fernando  earthquake.  We  believe 
a  better  description  would  include  variability  of  slip 
with  depth  on  the  fault  (for  example,  double  the  width 
of  the  fault  and  have  slip  decrease  linearly  from  the 
maximum  value  of  2  m  left  slip  and  2  m  reverse  slip  at 
upper  end  to  zero  at  the  lower  end)  and  subsidiary 
faults  near  the  toe  of  the  thrust. 

MEASUREMENT  Of  AFTERSUP 

Continued  slip  on  tectonic  fractures  has  been  ob- 
served following  a  number  of  California  earthquakes 
(Nason,  1969),  most  recently  following  the  1966  Park- 
field  and  1968  Borrego  Mountain  earthquakes  (Wal- 
lace and  Roth,  1967;  Smith  and  Wyss,  1968;  Burford, 
1972).  The  term  "afterslip"  for  this  phenomenon  has 
been  proposed  by  Nason  (1969,  1971)  to  emphasize  a 
space-time  relationship  to  aftershocks.  Afterslip  seems 
an  acceptable  term  inasmuch  as  decay  in  rate  of  con- 
tinued slip  apparently  parallels  a  similar  decay  in  fre- 
quency of  aftershocks  (Smith  and  Wyss,  1968), 
although  it  has  not  been  conclusively  demonstrated 
that  afterslip  is  generated  directly  by  sudden  slips  asso- 
ciated with  aftershocks  (Schoh  et'ni.,  1969,  p.  2058). 
Afterslip  may  in  fact  be  essentially  an  aseismic  phe- 
nomenon; although  directly  related  to  processes  ini- 
tiated during  large  earthquakes,  the  character  of  after- 
slip  is  thus  far  indistinguishable  from  that  of  fault 
creep. 

Observations  conducted  by  several  different  groups 
of  investigators  within  a  few  days  following  the  Feb- 
ruary 9,  1971,  main  shock  quickly  established  that 
afterslip  would  make  a  relatively  minor  contribution 
to  the  total  fault  slip  (Nason,  1971;  Lahr  ct  al.,  1971; 
Burford  ct  al.,  1971).  Precise  leveling  measurements 
across  the  Sylmar  segment  of  the  surface  break  re- 
peated several  times  through  a  200-day  period  by  Syl- 
vester and  Pollard  (this  Bulletin)  demonstrate  that 
significant  vertical  displacements  occurred,  the  char- 
acter of  which  indicates  definite,  though  minor,  after- 
slip  activit}-.  Reports  from  local  residents  that  offsets 
on  minor  fractures  north  of  the  Sylmar  segment  con- 
tinued to  grow  for  several  days  following  the  main 
shock  indicate  that  afterslip  nia\-  have  been  occurring 
on  subsidiar\-  faults  (U.S.  Geological  Survey  staff, 
1971,  p.  61).' 

\'arious  measurement  techniques  Mere  employed  in 
the  effort  to  detect  afterslip  at  a  number  of  localities 
along  the  prominent  surface  breaks.  The  methods  in- 
cluded repeated  distance  ranging  over  certain  of  the 
long  lines  used  in  the  horizontal  displacement  measure- 
ments described  above,  repeated  measurements  of  hori- 
zontal angles  and  lengths  within  small-scale  monument 
arrays,  installation  of  a  mechanical  displacement  re- 
corder, and  repeated  leveling  along  lines  of  monuments 
traversing  the  tectonic  surface  ruptures.  The  repeated 
leveling  was  the  most  successful  technique  employed, 
both  because  the  afterslip  had  a  significant  vertical 
component  and  because  the  afterslip  activit\-  was 
usually  diffused  across  a  fairly  wide  zone. 

We  earlier  reported  (Burford  et  al.,  1971,  p.  84) 
changes  in  length  for  several  lines  (SF8  to  PLl,  PLl 
to  MAYS2,  PE2  to  SF8,  and  PLl  to  PE2)  in  the  post- 
earthquake  period  February  11  to  February  23,  1971. 
These  changes  are  now  suspect  as  an  intermittent  mal- 


function in  the  temperature  control  of  the  crystal  oven 
in  the  Geodolite  was  detected  shortly  after  those  pre- 
liminarv  surveys  were  completed.  Thus,  we  cannot 
eliminate  the  possibility  that  the  changes  reported  were 
merely  a  consequence  of  etiuipment  failure.  The  sur- 
veys reported  earlier  in  this  paper  were  made  after 
the  malfunction  was  corrected. 

Five  small-scale  monument  arrays  were  installed 
across  surface  breaks  during  the  week  following  the 
main  shock,  two  on  the  Sylmar  segment,  one  on  the 
Tujunga  segment,  and  two  on  separate  breaks  in 
the  band  of  discontinuous  fractures  north  of  the  Tu- 
junga segment.  The  locations  of  these  arra_\s  are  shown 
by  positions  of  letter  symbols  A  through  E  in  figure  9. 
With  one  exception  (site  B)  all  of  the  array  configura- 
tions were  measured  more  than  once  during  Februar}% 
1971,  by  occupying  a  central-point  station  with  a  Wild 
T-3  theodolite  and  measuring  horizontal  and  vertical 
angles  to  the  outlying  monuments  at  distances  between 
50  and  225  m  from  the  instrument  station.  Distances 
to  two  points  from  the  instrument  station  within  each 
array  were  measured  by  angle  readings  on  Wild  sub- 
tense bars.  Repeated  horizontal  angle  measurements 
were  sufficiently  precise  for  detection  of  horizontal 
displacements  of  about  1.5  to  5.5  mm  (3  standard  de- 
viations), a  range  of  resolution  largely  dependent  upon 
distance  from  the  instrument  to  the  outlying  station. 
On  the  same  basis  repeated  vertical  angle  readings 
showed  a  range  of  resolution  from  about  1  to  about 
7.5  mm,  while  subtense-bar  angle  readings  were  only 
good  for  resolving  horizontal  distance  changes  greater 
than  15  mm. 

Significant  changes  in  the  small-scale  arrays  were 
recorded  at  only  two  sites  indicated  in  figure  9  as  loca- 
tions D  and  E.  At  the  Pierce  arra\-  (site  D),  measure- 
ments on  February  24  compared  with  initial  measure- 
ments on  February  11,  1971,  showed  that  a  monument 
85  n)  north  of  the  most  prominent  fault  scarp  rose 
3.2  ±  0.6  mm  while  a  monument  85  m  south  of  the 
scarp  rose  1.9  ±  0.6  mm  (standard  deviations)  relative 
to  the  instrument  station.  Measurements  at  the  Tujunga 
array  (site  E)  on  February  23  compared  with  initial 
measurements  on  February  12,  1971,  showed  that  a 
monument  on  the  north  side  of  minor  surface  cracks 
rose  9.7  ±  0.5  mm  w  hile  a  monument  about  90  m  south 
of  the  cracks  dropped  3.7  ±0.3  mm  relative  to  the 
instrument  station  which  was  also  south  of  the  cracks 
b\-  about  28  m.  No  other  significant  changes  were 
detected  in  the  remeasurenients  of  the  small-scale 
arrays. 

A  pair  of  \ertical  wire  extensometers  were  installed 
in  a  borehole  drilled  through  the  bedding-plane  reverse 
fault  exposed  in  Lopez  Canyon  about  900  m  north  of 
the  main  break  of  the  Tujunga  segment  (near  site  C, 
figure  9).  The  fault  scarp  site,  instrument  character- 
istics, and  preliminary  results  were  discussed  in  a  pre- 
vious report  (Burford  et  al.,  1971,  p.  84,  85).  Unfor- 
tunateh-,  considerable  doubt  was  cast  on  the  results 
from  the  extensometers  due  to  discover)'  of  possible 
instabilit\-  in  the  instrument  mounting  frame  at  the 
time  the  site  was  abandoned  in  July,  1971.  The  casing 
for  the  borehole  was  supported  in  part  by  friction 
between  the  outer  wall  of  the  casing  and  the  sidewall 
of  the  boring  and  in  part  by  steel  anchor-bars  welded

to  the  outside  of  the  casing  and  resting  on  the  ground 
surface.  The  instruments  were  attached  to  a  frame 
resting  on  the  steel  anchor-bars.  During  the  time  of 
operation,  part  of  the  casing  load  supported  by  friction 
was  transferred  to  the  anchor  bars,  perhaps  particu- 
larl\-  at  the  times  of  slight  shaking  during  the  larger 
aftershocks  on  February  20  (Burford  et  al.,  1971,  table 
3),  when  step-like  vertical  contraction  events  were 
recorded.  Some  vertical  e.xtension  events  were  also 
recorded,  however,  and  these  were  generally  charac- 
terized by  the  gradual  onset  of  displacement  typical 
of  creep  events  on  the  San  Andreas  fault.  An  interpre- 
tation of  the  vertical  extension  events  recorded  by  the 
instruments  as  an  indication  of  continued  reverse  slip 
on  the  fault  plane  is  supported  by  slight  changes  in 
level  readings  across  the  scarp  discussed  below. 

Repeated  precise  leveling  observations  were  carried 
out  by  crews  from  the  Topographic  Division  of  the 
U.S.  Geological  Survc\-  along  several  lines  of  monu- 
ments indicated  in  figure  9.  The  results  of  comparisons 
of  each  repeat  traverse  with  the  initial  levels  deter- 
mined soon  after  the  earthquake  are  shown  in  figure 
10.  Results  from  all  but  the  Gridlcy  line  (Line  2  in 
figure  9)  gave  some  indication  of  afterslip. 


The  Amission  Wells  line  (line  1  in  figure  9)  was 
routed  through  a  gap  between  the  southwest  end  of 
the  Sylmar  segment  and  the  northeast  end  of  the  Mis- 
sion Wells  segment  of  the  surface  break.  However, 
the  line  was  terminated  on  a  bench  mark  along  the 
railroad  at  a  point  near  the  northeast  end  of  the  Mission 
Wells  segment.  Fractures  passed  b\-  both  sides  of  the 
bench  mark,  and  level  changes  at  that  point  were  some- 
what erratic.  Relative  level  changes  at  the  remainder 
of  the  stations  show  that  between  February  21  and  22, 
1971,  the  area  along  a  projection  of  the  ends  of  the 
two  surface  breaks  was  uplifted  about  38  mm  relative 
to  the  north  end  of  the  level  line,  and  a  tilt  component 
of  about  40  microradians  in  the  direction  N.26°W. 
was  produced  on  the  surface  of  the  northwest  block. 
The  initial  tilt  and  relative  uplift  subsequently  col- 
lapsed and  at  the  same  time  points  southeast  of  the  line 
connecting  the  ends  of  the  two  surface  breaks  began 
to  drop,  suggesting  the  growth  of  a  downwarp  or 
slight  scarp  facing  southeast  w  hich  had  an  additional 
height  of  about  17  mm  by  April  5,  1971,  the  time  of 
the  final  observations. 

Level  changes  detected  along  Lopez  Can_\on  line 
(line  3  in  figure  9)  were  relativel\-  minor  but  some-

what  similar  to  those  along  the  Mission  Wells  line. 
During  the  period  February  16  to  April  2,  1971,  the 
vertical  component  of  clisplaccnient  across  the  main 
l)rcaU  of  the  Tujunga  segment  increased  by  about  17 
mm  while  an  additional  uplift  of  about  5  mm  occurred 
across  a  200  m  zone  including  the  surface  trace  of  the 
reverse  fault  discussed  above.  The  northward  tilt  of 
tlie  surface  north  of  tiic  main  fault  break  was  increased 
by  about  8  microradians  during  the  period  of  repeated 
measurements. 

Level  changes  along  the  Pierce  line  (line  4  in  figure 
9)  are  marginall\-  significant  but  are  consistent  in  indi- 
cating continued  upwarping  or  slight  growth  of  soutii- 
facing  scarps  across  a  200  m  zone  on  the  south  side  of 
tlic  most  prominent  surface  break  produced  during  the 
initial  rupture.  The  maximum  increase  in  the  uplift 
from  south  to  north  was  about  5  mm  from  Fcbruar\- 
15  to  February  25,  1971.  Afterslip  at  this  locality  was 
thus  barely  detectable  and  must  have  been  restricted 
to  extremely  shallow  portions  of  subsidiary  slip  planes, 
since  the  main  scarp  showed  no  significant  continued 
displacement  and  the  uplift  died  out  a  short  distance 
north  of  the  zone  of  afterslip  activit&gt;'. 

The  Little  Tujunga  line  (line  5  in  figure  9)  showed 
minor  changes  in  levels  except  for  one  interval  in  the 
vicinity  of  tlie  east  end  of  a  discontinuous  break  pass- 
ing tiirough  the  center  of  Section  5,  T.  2  N.,  R.  14  W. 
This  interval  showed  a  +  0.420  m  change  between 
survcNs  on  February  14  and  17,  1971.  Other  significant 
level  changes  occurred  at  the  north  end  of  the  line, 
which  developed  an  additional  15  to  20  mm  upwarp, 
and  at  the  site  of  the  main  break  at  the  mouth  of  Little 
Tujunga  Can\-on,  where  stations  5  through  14  dropped 
7  tf)  8  mm  relative  to  adjacent  points  and  a  possible 
nortii-facing  scarp  7.5  mm  high  might  iiave  developed 
just  south  of  the  main  scarp. 

The  large  uplift  occurred  within  a  zone  of  several 
minor  fractures  which  showed  only  slight  signs  of 
afterslip  activity.  In  spite  of  lack  of  evidence  of  major 
fracturing  in  the  surface  material,  we  conclude  that 
tile  data  are  not  in  error  and  that  the  movement  must 
have  occurred.  The  change  in  level  must  represent  the 
development  of  a  south-facing  monocline  in  surface 
materials  caused  b\'  underlying  eastward  migration  of 
slip  off  the  end  of  the  prominent  ~  0.5  ni  scarp  A\ell 
exposed  in  the  adjacent  stream  bed  (U.S.  Geological 
Survey  staff,  1971,  figure  2). 

Afterslip  apparcntl\-  was  best  developed  across  por- 
tions of  the  surface-break  trend  w  here  the  near-surface 
slip  was  either  discontinuous  or  poorly  developed.  The 
measurements  across  the  more  prominent  scarps  sucii 
as  along  the  main  break  of  the  Tujunga  segment  and 
the  0.8  m  scarp  north  of  the  main  break  in  Lopez 
Canyon  showed  onl\'  minor  changes.  Precise  leveling 


was  by  far  the  most  profitable  technique  employed 
in  the  search  for  evidence  of  afterslip,  and  should  be 
considered  the  most  effective  potential  method  for 
afterslip  studies  follow  ing  future  earthquakes  that  arc 
accompanied  by  surface  faulting  w  ith  appreciable  dip- 
slip  components.

CHAPTER    15 

Displacement  on  Tectonic  Ruptures^ 

By  Robert  V.  Sharp  ^ 


Tectonic  slip  was  determined  at  24  locations  along 
surface  ruptures  formed  at  the  time  of  the  1971  San 
Fernando  earthquake.  The  slip  vectors  generally  re- 
vealed a  marked  thrust  component  of  movement,  in 
addition  to  a  left-lateral  component,  along  the  Tu- 
junga  segment  of  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone.  How- 
ever, slip  vectors  determined  for  the  Sylmar  and  Mis- 
sion Wells  segments  of  the  zone  indicate  much  smaller 
thrust  components  and  instead  reflect  movement  con- 
sisting of  predominant  left-lateral  and  vertical  com- 
ponents. The  position  and  orientation  of  the  rupture 
traces,  when  combined  with  dips  inferred  from  the 
slip  vectors,  suggest  substantial  curvature  of  the  princi- 
pal fault  surface  at  depth.  The  composite  fault  surface 
suggested  by  surficial  dips  and  geologic  structure  is 
consistent  with  crustal  uplift '  data  and  aftershock 
distribution. 

Although  tectonic  ruptures  formed  by  the  1971  San 
Fernando  earthquake  were  clearly  expressed  at  the 
ground  surface,  the  fault  surfaces  generalh-  were  not 
exposed.  As  a  consecuence,  the  amount  and  direction 
of  slip  *  on  the  faults  were  commonly  not  directly 
measurable.  However,  they  could  be  measured  indi- 
rectly- by  combining  apparent  offsets  on  natural  and 
manmade  features  along  the  traces  of  the  surface 
breaks.  This  paper  describes  and  interprets  a  series  of 
slip  vectors  at  specific  points  along  the  fault  traces 
(see  figure  1);  such  information,  in  turn,  reveals  the 
dip  of  the  fault  at  the  surface  of  the  earth  (figure  2). 
The  inferred  dips,  together  with  other  dips  measured 
at  exposures  of  the  faults,  provide  an  important  datum 
for  reconstructing  a  composite  slip  surface  in  the 
shallow  part  of  the  crust.  Surficial  dips  can  then  be 
compared  to  the  probable  orientation  of  the  fault 
surface  at  greater  depth,  as  derived  from  the  relation- 
ship of  the  faults  to  bedding  in  the  rocks,  as  well  as 
the  location  of  the  main  shock  and  the  distribution  of 
aftershocks.  The  array  of  slip  vectors  suggests  im- 
portant surficial  deviations  from  the  over-all  slip  model 
of  simple  left-oblique  thrust  faulting. 

DETERMINATION  OF  SUP  VECTORS 

In  this  study,  slip  vectors  have  been  determined 
chiefly  by  geometrically  combining  a  vertical  compo- 


•  "Slip"  refers  herein  to  net  movement  (see  figure  3).

nent  indicated  by  the  height  of  a  scarp  with  lateral 
separations  or  dimensional  changes  on  two  horizontal 
and  nonparallel  linear  features  offset  by  the  fault.  The 
geometric  relation  of  the  various  measurements  and  the 
length  and  orientation  of  slip  vectors  is  shown  in  figure 
3.  Because  the  slip  vector  and  the  strike  of  the  fault  at 
the  point  of  observation  both  lie  in  the  surface  of  fault 
movement,  the  orientation  of  the  fault,  including  the 
direction  and  amount  of  dip,  is  established,  as  shown  in 
figure  4. 

Horizontal  components  of  most  slip  vectors  shown 
in  figure  1  were  determined  either  by  field  measure- 
ment of  offset  features  or  b\-  scaling  the  offsets  from 
l:2400-scale  vertical  air  photos.  Horizontal  offsets 
were  measured  in  the  field  chiefly  by  projecting  the 
position  of  an  offset  linear  feature  visually  from  the 
opposite  side  of  the  fault  to  the  near  side  and  scaling 
the  offset  with  a  tape;  such  determinations  are  proba- 
bly accurate  to  within  a  tenth  of  a  meter.  In  addition, 
horizontal  dimensional  changes  that  were  more  accu- 
rately measured  by  geodimeter  along  some  streets  in 
the  San  Fernando  area  are  used  in  this  study.  Hori- 
zontal offsets  scaled  from  air  photos  are  about  as  accu- 
rate as  those  measured  with  a  tape  in  the  field;  several 
checks  of  relatively  large  offsets  determined  from 
photos  closely  matched  corresponding  field  measure- 
ments. 

Vertical  components  of  displacement  were  also  de- 
termined by  various  methods.  Alost  measurements  were 
made  by  visual  projection,  using  the  ground  surface 
on  opposite  sides  of  the  fault  scarp  as  the  reference. 
A  few  measurements  came  from  leveling  surveys,  and 
two  were  obtained  from  plane-table  surveys  of  scarps 
on  the  trace  of  the  fault  (see  notes  in  table  1).  In  gen- 
eral, control  on  the  vertical  components  is  probably 
about  as  accurate  as  that  on  the  horizontal  components. 

To  minimize  errors  in  determining  individual  slip 
vectors,  all  the  component  offsets  or  dimensional 
changes  were  measured  as  near  as  possible  to  each 
other.  This  is  important  because  a  slip  vector  calcu- 
lated from  components  measured  at  widely  separated 
points  is  not  necessarily  a  simple  average  of  the  actual 
slip  at  the  two  points.  Relative!}'  large  errors  could 
result  if  components  were  measured  at  various  places 
along  a  fault  strand  where  displacement  was  changing 
abruptly  in  either  magnitude  or  direction,  or  both. 
Widely  scattered  measurements  along  the  Tujunga 
segment  probabK'  could  yield  relatively  large  errors 
because  slip  appears  to  be  moderately  variable  over 
short    distances    there.    However,    components   were

V  is  cell  diagonal.  Apparent  lateral  separation  a  of  linear  feature  at 
angle  a  from  fault  strike;  opporent  loterot  separation  b  of  second 
linear  feature  at  angle  ^  from  first;  vertical  component  of  slip  Is  c; 
plunge  ongle  of  slip  vector  is  ir;  azimuth  angle  of  slip  vector  (meas- 
ured from  fault  strike)  is  7;  length  of  vectors  shown  in  figure  1  corre- 
sponds to  horizontal  component  of  slip  vector,  he. 


measured  within  25  m  of  each  other  along  the  Tujunga 
segment,  so  the  computed  slip  vectors  are  probably 
reasonably  accurate  (see  table  1).  On  the  other  hand, 
some  parts  of  the  rupture  zone,  for  example  the  Sylmar 
segment  (figure  1),  show  only  slight  changes  in  slip 
along  much  of  the  trace.  \Vhen  slip  components  from 
widely  separated  points  along  this  fault  segment  are 
combined  into  a  slip  vector,  the  errors  that  result  are 
probably  only  slight. 

Three  checks  on  the  accuracy  of  the  slip  vectors  are 
included  among  those  shown  on  figure  1.  Vector  Y,  on 
the  Mission  Wells  segment,  was  determined  at  the 
location  of  an  exposure  of  the  fault  surface  that 
showed  slickensides.  The  computed  fault  dip  of  80°  N 
is  close  to  the  observed  dip  of  74°;  and  the  plunge  of 
the  computed  slip  vector,  31°N  59°  E,  closely  corres- 
ponds to  the  observed  sHckenslides,  which  plunge  29° 
N  55°  E.  \'ector  I  west  of  Lopez  Canyon  provided  a 
more  limited  check  in  that  the  fault  dip  exposed  in  a 
trench  dug  after  the  earthquake  was  used  to  calculate 
the  slip  vector.  How  ever,  the  computed  plunge  of  the 
slip  vector,  17°  N  55°  E,  corresponds  closely  to  the 
plunge  of  sHckenslides  observed  in  the  trench,  20°  N 
60°  E.  A  third  check,  on  vector  L  in  upper  Lopez 
Canyon,  has  been  described  previouslv  bv  M.  G. 
Bonilla  (U.S.  Geological  Survey,  1971,' p.  68-69);  a 
moderate  discrepancy  between  the  computed  slip  vec- 
tor and  sHckenslides  exposed  there  suggests  that  the 
latter  formed  during  a  previous  episode  of  fault 
movement. 

DISPIACEMEHI  ON  THE  SAN  FERNANDO 
FAULT  ZONE 
Tujunga  Segment  * 

Slip  varies  more  in  amount  and  direction  along  the 
zone  of  surface  ruptures  from  Pacoima  \\'ash  eastward 
to  Sunland  than  along  other  segments  of  the  1971 
breaks.  The  relatively  large  movement  that  was  meas- 
ured at  the  \\  estern  end  of  the  Tujunga  segment  (vec- 
tors L  J,  K,  figure  1  and  table  1 )  is  similar  in  amount 
and  direction  to  that  determined  along  the  Sylmar 
segment  just  west  of  Pacoima  Wash.  The  largest  slip 


in  the  Tujunga  .segment  (vector  I),  measured  at  the 
trailer  park  west  of  Lopez  Canyon,  was  about  2.1  m. 
Its  left-lateral  component  is  about  2.4  times  greater 
than  the  dip-slip  component.  Even  larger  slip  (not 
indicated  in  figure  1)  is  suggested  at  a  scarp  1.5  m 
high  found  farther  east  in  Oliver  Canyon  (see  Proc- 
tor and  others,  1972,  figures  10  and  12).  A  20°  dip 
on  the  fault  there  implies  a  slip  vector  of  at  least  4.4 
m.  However,  Mr.  R.  Cowan,  owner  of  the  property, 
indicated  that  part  of  the  present  height  of  the  scarp 
is  pre-earthquake  in  age,  so  that  slip  there  could  not  be 
accurately  estimated.  Although  large  slip  is  possible  at 
Oliver  Can\on,  east  of  Lopez  Canyon  all  measured 
slip  vectors  are  smaller  and  generally  less  systematic 
than  to  the  west.  All  but  two  vectors  (B  and  C  in  Big 
Tujunga  Wash)  east  of  Lopez  Canyon  have  a  substan- 
tial compressional  component  normal  to  the  fault 
trace.  However,  the  sense  of  the  lateral  component 
changes  from  uniformlv  left-lateral  in  the  western 
part  to  intermixed  slightly  right-  or  left-lateral  vectors 
in  the  central  part  (vectors  D  through  G)  and  back 
to  uniformly  left-lateral  near  the  eastern  terminus  of 
ground  rupture.  Although  nearly  all  of  the  vectors 
are  consistent  with  southward  overthrusting  of  the 
San  Gabriel  mountain  mass  relative  to  the  valley,  in- 
ternal spreading  and  piling  up  in  the  overthrust  block 
is  also  implied  b\'  the  changes  in  sense  of  lateral  com- 
ponents along  the  Tujunga  segment.  The  two  vectors 
that  show  predominantlv  strike-slip  in  Big  Tujunga 
Wash  (B  and  C)  may  reflect  anomalous  surface  geom- 
etry of  a  northward-dipping  thrust  fault  beneath  the 
thick  unconsolidated  alluvium,  despite  the  fact  that  the 
slip  vectors  indicate  steep  southward  dip  in  the  allu- 
vial material.  The  sinuous  traces  of  the  faults  there  in 
fact  suggest  shallow-dipping  slip  surfaces. 

Sylmar  Segment 

The  trace  of  the  Sylmar  segment  on  the  alluvial  sur- 
face near  the  city  of  San  Fernando  is  straighter  and 
more  continuous  than  along  most  of  the  Tujunga  seg- 
ment farther  east.  In  terms  of  slip  determined  along 
this  segment,  it  is  the  zone  of  both  the  most  consistent 
and  greatest  measured  fault  displacements.  Slip  appar- 
ently is  uniformh-  2.0  m  or  greater  from  near  the 
southwestern  end  of  the  segment  at  Glenoaks  Boule- 
vard eastward  at  least  to  Foothill  Boulevard  (vectors 
R  through  W,  figure  1  and  table  1).  Moreover,  the

horizontal  component  at  Freeway  210  (0.2  km  east  of 
vector  R)  is  also  apparently  greater  than  2  m  (a  com- 
plete slip  vector  was  not  obtained  there,  however). 
The  greatest  slip  occurred  between  .\delpiiia  and 
Orange  Grove  Avenues  (vectors  S,  T,  and  V'),  where 
it  measured  2.4  to  2. .I  ni.  The  left-lateral  component  in 
this  part  was  about  1.3  times  as  great  as  tiic  dip-slip 
component.  It  is  nntcworth)'  that  slip  vectors  in  the 
Sylmar  segment  lie  close  to,  or  on  line  with,  the  trace 
of  the  principal  break.  Such  a  relation  implies  minor 
comprcssional  components  of  offset  normal  to  the  fault 
trace,  leaving  transcurrent  (strike  slip)  and  vertical 
components  as  the  dominant  elements  of  movement. 
Fault  movement  near  the  eastern  end  of  the  Sylmar 
segment  and  in  the  complex  zone  of  surface  rupturing 
and  bending  farther  southeast  in  the  San  Fernando 
Industrial  Park  area  appears  to  be  substantially  smaller 
than  to  the  west.  In  spite  of  great  variation  in  strike 
of  individual  ruptures,  three  of  four  slip  vectors  are 
oriented  in  the  southwest  quadrant  essentially  parallel 
to  others  farther  w  est  in  the  segment.  One  slip  vector, 
N,  was  not  associated  with  an\-  obvious  rupture,  yet 
the  ground  changed  dimensions  by  an  amount  consist- 
ent with  other  slip  vectors  in  the  general  area.  Vector 
M  is  unusual  because  it  is  oriented  nearly  perpendicular 
to  all  other  slip  vectors  in  the  immediate  area,  but  the 
anomal&gt;-  could  be  explained  by  a  large  nontectonic 
component  of  thrusting  at  the  toe  of  a  large  landslide 
mass  on  the  steep  slope  immediately  to  the  east.  This 
interpretation  is  supported  by  abundant  landslide  scars 
observed  on  the  slope  and  by  geodetic  data  that  show 
an  anomalously  large  westward  shift  of  the  hilltop 
above  the  slope  (Savage  and  others,  this  Bulletin,  sta- 
tion PL  1  in  figure  7). 

Mission  Wells  Segment 

Like  the  Sylmar  segment,  which  is  aligned  with  it, 
the  Mission  \\'ells  segment  is  continuous  and  nearly 
straight.  However,  fault  movement  on  this  zone  is 
much  smaller  than  the  largest  found  on  the  other  seg- 
ments. Two  slip  vectors,  X  and  Y,  are  essentially 
equal,  amounting  to  about  0.5  m  of  fault  movement. 
The  orientation  of  the  slip  vectors  very  nearly  coin- 
cides with  the  trace  of  the  fault  rupture,  as  along  much 
of  the  Sylmar  segment.  The  left-lateral  components 
apparently  are  about  L5  to  L7  times  greater  than  the 
dip-slip  components,  a  somewhat  greater  ratio  than 
found  along  the  Sylmar  .segment. 

GEOMETRY  OF  THE  FAULT  SURFACES 

.Angles  of  dip  of  the  tectonic  ruptures  that  have 
been  measured  in  the  field  or  inferred  from  the  slip 
vectors  are  shown  in  figure  2.  These  dips  generally 
suggest  that  most  c)f  the  fault  segments  that  moved 
during  the  earth(iuake  arc  essentially  bedding-plane 
faults  where  thc\-  emerge  at  the  ground  surface.  This 
general  relationship  is  shown  by  exposures  of  the  fault 
and  bedding  along  the  Tujunga  segment,  by  bedding 
exposed  near  the  Sylmar  and  Mi.ssion  Wells  segments, 
as  well  as  b\  regional  bedding  orientation  relative  to 
the  overall  trace  of  surface  rupture.  The  array  of  in- 
ferred and  observed  fault  dips  .suggests  that  thcMission 
Wells  and  Sylmar  segments  on  the  valley  surface  dip 


steepl\-  to  verticall)-,  whereas  the  Tujunga  segment 
dips  shallowly  to  moderately  northward  beneath  the 
margin  of  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains.  The  fault  seg- 
ments transecting  the  floor  of  San  Fernando  \'alley 
arc  considerably  straightcr  and  more  continuous  than 
the  breaks  along  the  front  of  the  range,  which  also 
suggests  that  the  near-surface  dip  of  the  faults  is 
steep.  Despite  the  absence  of  obvious  displacement  at 
the  northeastern  end  of  the  .Mission  AV'ells  segment, 
right-stepping  en  echelon  fractures  ob.servcd  on  the 
natural  ground  .surface  also  suggest  left-lateral  move- 
ment on  a  steep  fault  surface  at  that  point. 

Bv  considering  the  relative  positions  of  the  fault 
traces  and  the  fault  dips  and  directions  of  slip,  a  fairly 
simple  composite  surface  of  tectonic  movement  was 
constructed  that  shows  how  the  disconnected  surface 
ruptures  could  merge  into  a  single  continuous  zone  of 
slip  at  depth.  The  shape  of  the  slip  surface,  illustrated 
in  figure  5,  is  designed  to  be  consistent  with  geologic 
relationships  at  the  surface  and  with  the  net  regional 
dip  indicated  by  aftershocks  of  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake. 

The  shape  of  the  slip  surface  along  the  eastern  part 
of  the  Sylmar  segment  and  along  the  Tujunga  segment 
has  been  drawn  to  reflect  downward  curvature  of  bed- 
ding in  rocks  adjoining  the  faults.  Exposures  of  the 
fault  in  Cenozoic  sediments  along  the  Tujunga  seg- 
ment indicate  that  the  slip  surface  is  esscntiall\-  parallel 
to  bedding  (Kamb  and  others,  1971;  U.S.  Geological 
Survey,  1971;  Barrows  and  others,  this  Bulletin).  The 
regional  strike  of  bedding  along  the  front  of  the  San 
Gabriel  .Mountains  also  parallels  the  trace  of  the  Tu- 
junga segment  (see  Oakeshott,  1958,  plate  1;  .Metro- 
politan Water  District,  1968).  .\ssuming  that  the  ob- 
served conformable  relationship  holds  for  at  least  a 
short  distance  downdip,  the  slip  surface  would 
abruptly  steepen  only  a  few  hundred  meters  north  of 
its  trace.  This  steepening  is  indicated  b\-  the  general 
increase  in  dip  of  bedding  from  about  30°  at  the  range 
front  to  as  much  as  85°  a  short  distance  farther  north 
(Oakeshott.  1958;  .Metropolitan  Water  District,  1968). 
However,  it  should  be  emphasized  that  parallelism  of 
the  slip  surface  and  bedding  probably  does  not  con- 
tinue to  a  ver\-  great  depth,  perhaps  less  than  1  or  2 
km,  because  aftershock  data  suggest  a  net  regional 
northward  dip  on  the  fault  surface  of  about  35°  (Allen 
and  others,  this  Bulletin),  whereas  regional  geology 
suggests  that  bedding  is  steep  to  much  greater  depths. 
Thus,  the  inclination  of  the  deep  part  of  the  Tujunga 
segment  shown  in  figure  5  probably  is  similar  to  that 
observed  at  the  fault  trace. 

A  shallow -dipping  range-front  fault  that  rolls  to  a 
steeper  dip  while  maintaining  es.sentially  the  same 
strike  may  explain  the  pattern  of  maximum  vertical 
uplift  shown  by  Savage  and  others  (this  Bulletin,  figure 
2).  Their  data  indicate  that  a  linear  maximum  of 
crustal  uplift  immediately  north  of  the  Sylmar  segment 
continues  eastward  into  the  projecting  part  of  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains,  rather  than  deflecting  southward 
around  the  margin  of  the  range,  as  might  be  expected 
from  the  position  of  the  trace  of  the  Tujunga  seg- 
ment. The  pattern  of  uplift  could  result  from  move- 
ment on  a  shallow -dipping  fault  that  steepens  as  it 
approaches  the  ground  surface.

Dips  inferred  from  the  slip  vectors  along  the  Sylmar 
segment  are  generally  steep,  but  near  its  eastern  termi- 
nus the  fault  apparently  dips  moderately  to  the  north 
(see  figure  2).  The  Sylmar  segment  may  be  nearly 
concordant  in  dip  with  the  moderately  steep  bedding 
revealed  at  scattered  exposures  between  Pacoima  Wash 
and  Hubbard  Street  (California  State  Water  Rights 
Board,  1962,  p.  52;  Proctor  and  others,  1972,  figure 
3).  In  the  same  area,  concordance  in  strike  is  shown 
by  the  attitude  of  bedding  on  both  local  and  regional 
scales.  For  e.xample,  the  apparent  regional  trend  of  the 
base  of  the  Saugus  Formation  (see  Oakeshott,  1958, 
plate  1),  \\hich  is  essentially  conformable  to  bedding 
above  and  below  the  contact,  is  nearly  parallel  to  the 
trace  of  the  Sylmar  and  Mission  Wells  segments. 

A  similar  parallelism  bet^\'een  the  slip  surface  and 
bedding  is  also  suspected  for  the  Alission  Wells  seg- 
ment. Bedding  is  not  kno\\n  to  be  visible  adjacent  to 
the  zone  of  surface  rupture,  but  0.4  km  on  strike  from 
the  west  end  of  the  1971  break  beds  of  the  Pico  For- 
mation are  essentially  parallel  to  the  steep  fault  surface 
exposed  at  vector  Y  (Oakeshott,  1958,  plate  1). 

If  the  probable  steep  surficial  dip  along  the  western 
part  of  the  Sylmar  segment  and  the  iMission  Wells  seg- 
ment is  reconciled  with  the  regional  dip  of  the  fault 
zone  at  greater  depth,  as  shown  by  the  locations  of 
aftershock  hypocenters  (Allen  and  others,  this  Bulle- 


tin), another  warp  in  the  fault  surface  is  suggested.  In 
figure  5,  this  warp  is  depicted  as  the  downward  flat- 
tening of  dip  of  these  fault  segments,  joining  an  essen- 
tially smooth  and  shallow-dipping  fault,  the  surface 
trace  of  which  may  lie  at  or  near  the  Alission  Hills 
thrust  (see  Oakeshott,  1958,  plate  1).  Southwcstward 
motion  of  the  northern  block  \\ould  not  pile  material 
up  there,  as  along  the  eastern  part  of  the  1971  surface 
ruptures  if  the  dip  is  relatively  smooth  to  the  near 
surface.  By  contrast,  along  the  zones  \\here  the  dips 
are  steep,  the  thrust  component  of  movement  at  great 
depth  may  require  upward  release  through  a  larger 
component  of  crustal  uplift  adjacent  to  the  faults  on 
the  northern  side. 

The  surficial  dips  inferred  from  the  slip  vectors  and 
their  downward  projection  suggested  by  surface  geol- 
ogy provide  the  primary  basis  for  the  reconstruction 
of  the  warped  fault  surface  shown  in  figure  5.  The 
form  of  the  fault  surface  at  great  depth  is  controlled 
only  by  the  gross  pattern  of  aftershocks.  Although 
representation  of  the  zone  of  rupturing  at  depth  as  a 
single  surface  is  an  oversimplification,  in  vie\\'  of  the 
irregular  vertical  distribution  of  aftershocks,  much  of 
the  tectonic  slip  ma\-  have  occurred  within  a  relativcK' 
narrow  zone  of  rock.  Of  course,  considering  that  the 
ground  surface  broke  at  a  number  of  places  at  con- 
siderable distance  from  the  most  prominent  zone  of

rupture  (sec  Biirrous  and  others,  this  Bulletin),  the 
pattern  of  fault  slip  in  the  overthrust  montainous  block 
is  obviously  more  complicated  tiian  here  suggested. 
However,  the  emergence  of  relatively  steeply  dipping 
ruptures,  such  as  the  scarp  in  upper  Lopez  Canyon 
near  the  concealed  near-vertical  zone  of  the  fault  sur- 
face, would  be  expected  because  the  overthrust  block- 
must  deform  internalK-  to  accommodate  the  curvature 
of  the  principal  slip  surface. 

The  slip  surface  illustrated  in  figure  5  has  an  essen- 
tially smooth  sole  at  great  depth,  .\ccording  to  .Mien 
and  others  (this  Bulletin,  figure  5),  however,  the  rea- 
son for  the  major  southwestw  ard  deflection  of  the  rup- 


ture trace  in  the  western  part  of  the  S\'lmar  segment 
and  in  the  Mission  Wells  segment  is  that  the  sole  is 
w  arped  at  depth.  Their  inferred  north-northeast-trend- 
ing and  steepl\'  westward-dipping  zone  \\  ould  raise  the 
slip  surface  to  a  higher  level  east  of  the  bend  in  the 
Sylmar  segment.  How  ever,  the  probable  bedding-plane 
slip  relationship  for  most  of  the  rupture  zone  suggests 
that  the  steeplv  dipping  zones  shown  at  or  near 
the  ground  surface  may  cffectivel&gt;'  cancel  the  effect  of 
the  major  irregularities  of  the  fault  traces.  .\  reasonable 
downward  projection  of  these  steepl&gt;'  dipping  zones 
could  \ieid  an  approximatel\'  smooth  sole  for  the 
principal  slip  surface,  although  the  control  on  its 
shape  at  that  depth  admittedly  is  weak.

Determined  by  Remeasuring  Gravity

ABSTRACT 

Between  March  1971  and  February  1972,  one  to  seven 
remeasurements  of  gravity  were  made  at  each  of  88  grav- 
ity stations  established  between  1958  and  1970  in  the 
vicinity  of  San  Fernando  by  C.  E.  Corbato,  R.  B.  Grannell, 
J.  F.  Long,  W.  F.  Hanna,  R.  H.  Chapman  and  S.  L.  Rob- 
bins.  The  gravity  network  was  retied  to  the  University  of 
California  at  Los  Angeles,  where  a  tidal  gravity  record 
showed  no  gravity  change  at  the  time  of  the  earthquake 
(L.  B.  Slichter,  written  communication,  1971). 

Statistically  significant  decreases  in  gravity  (&gt;0.06 
mgal)  were  recorded  at  about  20  stations  north  of  the  zone 
of  thrust-fault  surface  ruptures.  The  maximum  decrease 
measured  was  — 0.45  mgal  between  Little  Tujunga  and 
Big  Tujunga  Canyons,  where  the  interpolated  elevation 
increase  was  about  -\-7  m.  In  general,  the  gravity  changes 
(Ag)  are  proportional  to  changes  in  elevation  (AE)  accord- 
ing to  the  least  squares  relation  Ag  ^ — 0.21 5AE  ± 
0.026  (s.d.),  where  AE  in  meters  yields  Ag  in  mgal.  The 
slope,  — 0.215  mgal/m,  corresponds  to  a  Bouguer  reduc- 
tion density  of  2.2g/cm').  The  changes  in  Bouguer  anoma- 
lies reduced  by  the  density  of  unsaturated  alluvium  (2.0 
g/cm')  are  small  (^0.08  mgal)  and  indicate  that  the  up- 
lift involved  primarily  the  stacking  of  surficial-type  layers 
on  the  pre-earthquake  surface  level,  as  might  be  expected 
in  thrust  faulting. 

Detailed  changes  in  Bouguer  anomalies  along  Foothill 
Boulevard,  though  barely  significant,  are  systematic,  being 
generally  positive  north  of  the  Sylmar  segment  of  the  sur- 
face ruptures.  Corrections  have  been  made  for  observed 
changes  in  the  local  water  table  level  between  1958  and 
1971;  and  the  residual  data  were  interpreted  as  a  sub- 
surface movement  at  a  centroid  depth  of  120  m,  perhaps 
representing  the  net  sum  of  the  displacements  of  the  bot- 
tom 1-2  m  of  beds  within  the  Cenozoic  section  by  higher 
density  beds  beneath  resulting  from  left-oblique  reverse 
movement  of  the  northern  block. 

The  overage  free-air  anomaly  within  the  area  of  uplift 
increased   about  0.20   mgal,   whereas   isostatic   anomalies

increased  somewhat  less,  about  0.12  mgal;  but  that  in- 
crease extended  over  a  larger  area.  Whatever  the  state 
of  isostatic  compensation  before  the  earthquake,  the  re- 
gion of  uplift  is  now  slightly  heavier.  Much  of  the  mass 
increase  in  the  uplifted  area  may  hove  come  from  the 
region  of  the  epicenter,  where  a  positive  inverted  "U" 
shaped  gravity  change  con  be  explained  by  subsidence 
and  mass  removal. 

On  February  9,  1971,  a  moderate  earthquake  (ap- 
proximately 6'/2  magnitude  on  the  Richter  scale)  oc- 
curred in  the  northern  San  Fernando  Valley  and  adja- 
cent parts  of  the  San  Gabriel  Alountains,  California. 
The  year  following  a  study  was  made  of  gravity 
changes.  Left  oblique  thrust-fault  ruptures  that  formed 
along  the  San  Fernando  fault  system  strike  approxi- 
mately east-west  and  dip  between  30°  and  75°  north 
(Sharp,  this  Bulletin;  Barrows  and  others,  1971). 
Available  data  on  change  in  elevation  indicate  that  up- 
lift associated  with  the  faulting  locally  exceeded  2  m 
along  an  east-trending  axis  about  2  km  north  of  the 
surface  fractures;  farther  north,  the  amount  of  uplift 
decreased  more  gradually,  exceeding  -|-0.5  m  for  some 
distance  into  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  (Burford  and 
others,  1971;  Savage  and  others,  figure  2,  this  Bulle- 
tin). Precise  data  on  leveling  prior  to  the  earthquake 
are  not  available  for  much  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains, and  the  extent  and  amount  of  elevation  change 
in  the  region  10-20  km  north  of  the  surface  ruptures 
is  not  well  known. 

The  core  of  the  San  Gabriel  iMountains  consists  of 
Precambrian  to  .Mesozoic  metamorphic  and  plutonic 
rocks  flanked  by  thick  sections  of  Cenozoic  marine 
and  nonmarine  sedimentary  rocks.  All  of  these  rocks 
show  widespread  evidence  of  deformation  throughout 
the  Cenozoic  Era  (Oakeshott,  1958).  The  San  Fer- 
nando \^alley  is  a  depositional  basin  with  a  thickness 
of  as  much  as  5  km  of  sedimentar\'  strata  dating  from 
middle  Miocene  time  (Corbato,  1963).  The  northern 
margins  of  the  \'alley  are  bounded  by  a  series  of 
north-dipping  thrust  faults  (Wentwortli  and  Yerkes, 
1971). 

There  have  been  limited  studies  of  gravity  changes 
accompanying  previous  earthquakes  in  Japan  (Matu- 
zawa,  1964,  p.  41),  in  Alaska  (Barnes,  1966,  1969;  and 


196 


California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology 


Bull.   196 


Rice,  1969),  and  in  New  Zealand  (Hunt,  1970).  The 
most  definitive  of  these  studies  is  that  by  Barnes,  who 
reported  gravity  changes  at  about  35  stations  in 
Alaska  after  the  8.4-magnitude  earthquake  of  March 
27,  1964.  The  gravity  changes  (Ag)  ranged  from  —0.4 
to  +0.5  mgal  and,  at  least  in  the  uplifted  area,  were 
related  to  elevation  changes  (AE)  by  the  Bouguer 
relation  for  an  assumed  density  of  about  2.7  g/cm' 
(Ag  =  —0.20  AE,  where  AE  in  meters  yields  Ag  in 
mgal).  However,  the  Ag-AE  data  showed  a  significant 
scatter  from  linearity  and  suggested  a  free-air  relation- 
ship (that  is,  Ag  =  —0.31  AE)  over  a  portion  of  the 
downdropped  area.  Hunt  (1970)  also  reported  a 
Bouguer  relation  between  gravity  and  elevation 
changes  for  the  1968  Inangahua  (New  Zealand)  earth- 
quake; but  he  had  only  two  reoccupiable  gravity  sta- 
tions within  the  uplifted  area,  and  these  showed  a 
change  in  gravity  of  —0.18  and  —0.36  mgal.  The 
corresponding  elevation  changes  were  +1.2  and  +1.8 
m,  giving  slopes  Ag/AE  of  —0.15  and  —0.20  mgal/m, 
respectively. 

These  pioneer  studies  introduced  a  new  method  for 
studying  geodetic  movements  associated  with  earth- 
quakes, but  their  data  were  rather  meager  and  the  re- 
sults inconclusive  as  regards  both  geodetic  applications 
and  the  determination  of  subsurface  movements. 

As  Barnes  pointed  out,  the  sensitivity,  calibration, 
and  stability  of  gravity  meters  are  now  sufficient  to 
make  studies  reliable.  There  are  two  important  requi- 
sites for  detecting  gravity  changes:  (1)  the  vertical 
component  of  tectonic  displacements  needs  to  be  of 
the  order  of  Y)  m  or  more,  as  at  San  Fernando  (hori- 
zontal displacements  have  not  yet  been  studied  and 
they  will  probably  need  to  be  large);  and  (2)  re- 
liable gravity  stations  must  have  been  established  in 
the  area  prior  to  the  earthquake. 

Finding  reliable  gravity  stations  to  reoccupy  after 
an  earthquake  is  usually  difficult.  Fortunately,  in  the 
San  Fernando  area,  the  density  of  reoccupiable  sta- 
tions was  such  that  a  study  could  be  made.  These  sta- 
tions include:  (a)  a  gravity  survey  of  the  San  Fer- 
nando Valley  by  Corbato  (1963)  made  in  1958  using 
a  Worden  gravimeter  (W88)  and  very  tight  contror, 
(b)  unpublished  data  in  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains 
obtained  by  Shawn  Biehler  in  1964  and  by  R.  B.  Gran- 
nell  and  J.  F.  Long  in  1970  using  LaCoste  and  Rom- 


berg gravity  meter  G22;  (c)  rvvo  gravity  base  stations 
established  by  Chapman  (1966)  in  1963  using  a  La- 
Coste and  Romberg  gravimeter  G22;  (d)  two  moun- 
tain gravimeter  calibration  loops — (1)  the  Mt.  Wilson 
loop  established  by  Harrison  and  Corbato  (1965) 
using  a  LaCoste  and  Romberg  geodetic  gravimeter 
(DL-1),  located  on  the  southeast  side  of  the  earth- 
quake area,  and  (2)  the  Mt.  Pinos  loop  established  by 
the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (Barnes  and  others,  1969) 
using  several  LaCoste  and  Romberg  gravimeters,  lo- 
cated northwest  of  the  earthquake  area;  and  (e)  two 
U.S.  Geological  Survey  field  stations  located  about  13 
km  north  of  Newhall. 

We  regard  all  of  the  data  of  these  surveys  to  be 
accurate  to  dr0.05  mgal  or  better,  except  those  ob- 
tained by  Grannell  and  Long,  whose  data  in  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains  have  a  marginal  accuracy  of 
±(0.05-0.12)  mgal.  Because  of  their  strategic  loca- 
tion in  areas  where  gravity  changes  of  0.10  to  0.50 
mgal  were  considered  possible  on  the  basis  of  eleva- 
tion changes,  40  of  their  stations  were  also  reoccupied. 

REOCCUPATION  OF  STATIONS 
Between  March  1971  and  February  1972,  one  to 
seven  remeasurements  of  gravity  were  made  at  each 
of  88  gravity  stations  selected  from  the  surveys  listed. 
Data  for  48  of  the  88  stations  reoccupied  are  based 
on  direct  ties  to  either  base  station  MvV-l  located  at 
the  University  of  California  at  Los  Angeles  (UCLA) 
or  base  station  MW-2  at  the  California  Institute  of 
Technology  (Cal  Tech)  (figure  9).  Grannell  and 
Long's  data  were  tied  to  Chapman's  (1966)  base  sta- 
tion 307  at  San  Fernando  City  Hall.  The  base  station 
at  UCLA  was  Corbato's  (1963)  prime  base  for  his  San 
Fernando  Valley  survey  and  is  the  starting  point  of 
the  Mt.  Wilson  calibration  range.  L.  B.  Slichter  (writ- 
ten communication,  1971)  provided  a  copy  of 
UCLA's  tidal  gravimeter  recording  for  the  period 
covering  several  hours  before  until  several  hours  after 
the  earthquake  (figure  1).  Tidal  gravity  level  before 
and  after  the  shocks  indicates  that  there  was  no  grav- 
ity change  at  UCLA. 

We  are  satisfied  that  there  was  no  gravity  change 
at  Cal  Tech  within  the  reliability  of  five  pre-  and  six 
post-earthquake  measurements  made  with  LaCoste  and 
Romberg  meters  relative  to  UCLA  or  our  prime  base

from  0200  to  1100  shown  on  the  record  are  in  Pacific  Standard  Time.  The  magnitude  of  the  main  shock  and  the  four  aftershocks  having  magnitudes 
greater  than  5  are  shown  ot  their  approximate  time  positions  ofter  Allen  ond  others  (1971).  Each  of  the  10  horizontal  lines  moking  up  a  vertical 
Kole  represent  an  increment  of  0.014  mgal.  Tidal  gravity  at  UCLA  hod  de:reased  about  0.3  mgal  from  0200  to  0600:41.6  PST,  the  time  of  the  main 
shock.  The  pen,  after  being  knocked  off  scale,  returned  to  the  same  sinuous  level  about  0620  PST  ofter  seismic  motion  from  the  second  5.1  magni- 
tude aftershock   had   subsided.   No  earthquake-induced   change   in   grovity   occurred  at  UCLA  greater  than  the  accuracy  of  the  record  (±0.001   mgal).

in  Menlo  Park  (Oliver,  1965).  The  gravity  difference 
(Ag)  between  the  means  of  the  two  sets  of  data  is 
Ag  =  0.00  ±  0.05  (s.d.)  mgal. 

Several  ties  have  been  made  between  the  base  sta- 
tion at  UCLA  and  Chapman's  base  at  San  Fernando 
Cit&gt;'  Hall,  a  base  station  at  Exposition  Park,  Los  An- 
geles (MP-lS,  one  starting  point  for  the  Mt.  Pinos 
calibration  range),  a  U.S.  Air  Force  base  station 
(LA-K)  at  the  Los  Angeles  International  Airport 
(Jablonski,  1970),  a  California  Division  of  Mines  and 
Geology  base  station  (CH320),  also  at  the  Los  An- 
geles International  Airport  (Chapman,  1966),  and  the 
U.S.  Geological  Survey  Regional  Center  in  Menlo 
Park.  None  of  these  ties  show  evidence  for  any  grav- 
ity change. 

All  of  the  above  base  station  ties,  the  calibration 
loops  to  Mt.  Wilson  and  Mt.  Pinos,  and  most  of  Cor- 
bato's  data  in  San  Fernando  Valley  were  remeasured 
with  two  LaCoste  and  Romberg  gravity  meters  G17 
and  G161.  These  two  meters  were  checked  for  cali- 
bration and  stability  just  prior  to  and  immediately 
after  completion  of  the  measurements  by  running 
them  over  the  Mt.  Hamilton  calibration  range  east 
of  San  Jose,  California  (Barnes  and  others,  1969).  The 
Biehler  1964  data  and  two  of  the  Long  pre-earthquake 
data  in  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  were  reoccupied 
by  Biehler  and  S.  W.  Smith  relative  to  the  Cal  Tech 
base  with  LaCoste  and  Romberg  meter  G22.  The 
Grannell  and  the  Long  data  were  rerun  using  LaCoste 
and  Romberg  meter  G141.  The  last  group  of  reoccu- 
pation  data,  those  along  Foothill  Boulevard  in  San 
Fernando  (figure  6),  were  obtained  primarily  by 
Alewine  using  a  Worden  Master  W533.  Alewine  made 
at  least  five  ties  to  each  of  the  eight  stations,  and  his 
mean  values  were  checked  at  two  stations  with  La- 
Coste and  Romberg  instruments  which  agreed  within 
±0.01  mgal.  All  of  the  reoccupation  observed  gravity 
values  relative  to  UCLA  or  Cal  Tech  are  probably 
accurate  to  ±0.03  mgal,  whereas  the  single  loop  data 
relative  to  San  Fernando  City  Hall  are  considered 
reliable  to  ±0.05  mgal  (see  Woollard,  1964). 

Most  of  the  88  stations  reoccupied  are  located 
within  5  km  north  of  the  tectonic  ruptures,  the  area 
of  greatest  vertical  movement  (figure  2).  Very  little 
vertical  control  was  available  in  the  northeast  part  of 
the  "area  of  aftershocks"  reported  by  Wesson  and 
others  (1971)  and  reproduced  in  figure  2.  We  con- 
centrated in  this  northeast  sector  and  tried  to  bracket 
the  area  quickly  to  serve  as  a  guide  to  the  more  ac- 
curate but  much  slower  and  expensive  precision-level 
surveys  for  determining  the  extent  of  uplift. 

Table  1  gives  the  principal  facts  for  all  the  stations 
plotted  in  figure  2.  The  most  important  facts  are  the 
changes  in  gravity,  elevation,  and  Bouguer  anomalies. 
It  is  also  important  to  note  the  years  in  which  the  pre- 
earthquake  measurements  were  made,  in  particular  the 
difference  in  the  time  the  original  gravity  and  the  ele- 
vation controls  were  established;  for  example,  1964 
versus  1929  respectively,  for  station  Bl  56.  The  uncer- 


tainties in  both  the  gravity  and  elevation  changes  are 
somewhat  variable  and  must  be  considered  in  interpre- 
tation of  the  data.  The  changes  in  Bouguer  anomalies 
(table  1,  last  column)  were  calculated  on  the  assump- 
tion that  the  surficial  materials  displaced  above  the 
pre-earthquake  surface  have  a  density  of  2.0  g/cm*. 
If  the  actual  densities  of  these  unsaturated  late  Ceno- 
zoic  deposits  were  actually  lower  or  higher  by 
0.2  g/cm^,  the  changes  in  Bouguer  anomalies  would 
be  altered  by  only  0.01  mgal  per  meter  of  elevation 
change. 

The  gravity  changes  within  the  immediate  vicinity 
of  the  area  of  aftershocks  (figure  2)  are  plotted  and 
contoured  as  figure  3.  The  measured  gravity  changes 
marked  by  circled  dots  have  been  supplemented  by 
releveling  data  converted  to  gravity  changes  accord- 
ing to  the  formula  Ag  (in  mgal)  =  —0.215  AE  (in 
meters).  This  relation  is  based  on  a  least  squares  linear 
fit  of  the  data  in  table  1,  for  which  both  the  gravity 
change  (Ag)  and  elevation  change  (AE)  were  deter- 
mined. These  data  are  plotted  on  figure  4;  the  least 
squares  line  is  shown  and  corresponds  to  a  Bouguer 
gradient  for  a  density'  (q)  of  2.2  g/cm^,  a  value 
slightly  higher  than  the  2.0  g/cm^  used  in  the  reduc- 
tion of  Bouguer  anomaly  changes  (table  1). 

The  measured  gravity  changes  (figure  3)  have  been 
contoured  with  an  interval  of  0.1  mgal  using  the  re- 
leveling  data  converted  to  equivalent-gravit\'-change 
as  supplemental  control.  The  general  form  of  the  con- 
tours is  independent  of  the  values  computed  from  re- 
leveling  data,  the  latter  contributing  mostly  toward 
the  closing  of  the  —0.10  and  —0.20  contours  west 
of  Sylmar  and  in  the  vicinity  of  Big  Tujunga  Canyon. 
In  areas  where  the  gravit\'  and  releveling  data  coin- 
cide or  interfinger,  they  are  surprisingly  consistent 
within  the  uncertainties  in  the  gravity  changes  of  0.04 
to  0.10  mgal.  This  consistency  and  the  continuity  of 
plotted  Bouguer  anomalies  within  the  contour  pat- 
tern suggest  that  our  calculated  uncertainties  (table  1) 
are  somewhat  conserA'ative  and  that  much  of  the 
gravit&gt;'-change  data  is  actually  good  to  0.01  to  0.04 
mgal. 

South  of  the  zone  of  tectonic  ruptures,  measured 
gravity  changes  are  less  than  the  uncertainties  of  the 
measurements  except  at  station  CR12,  located  about 
2  km  south  of  San  Fernando  Dam  (table  1,  figure  2). 
The  data  for  this  station  are  enigmatic  because  they 
indicate  a  significant  gravity  decrease  of  0.15  mgal 
at  a  location  where  it  is  rather  certain  that  the  eleva- 
tion has  not  changed  (see  footnote  6,  table  1).  The 
gravit&gt;'  decrease  is  based  on  four  independent  ties 
yielding  observed  gravity  values  of  —0.13,  —0.13, 
—0.15,  and  —0.19  mgal  lower  than  the  average  of 
Corbato's  (1963)  three  measurements  in  1958.  The 
enigma  could  be  an  error  in  our  relocation  of  Cor- 
bato's measurement;  but  the  station  is  distinctive,  being 
directly  over  a  contractor's  mark  (Robbins  and  others, 
1972).  The  apparent  local  decrease  of  about  0.15  mgal 
in  Bouguer  anomaly  as  well  as  in  gravity  may  be  real, 
and  a  closed  —0.10  mgal  contour  around  the  station 
has  been  included  in  the  contour  map.

Elevation   change   (AE)   in   meters 


Figure  4.  Plot  of  gravity  changes  versus  elevation  changes  listed  in  table  1.  Corresponding  station  numbers  and  rectangles  of  uncertainty  ore  indi- 
cated for  each  point.  A  least  squares  line  was  fit  to  all  points  having  a  AE  &gt;  0.2  m  except  B156  and  177;  these  points  were  deleted  from  the 
calculation  because  of  their  larger  uncertainty  (±0.10  mgal).  Least  squares  line  corresponds  to  a  simple  Bouguer  relation  between  Ag  and  AE, 
assuming  the  average  density  of  roclts  malting  up  the  elevotion  change  is  2.2  g/cm'.  A  line  corresponding  to  the  free-air  gradient  is  shown  for 
comparison. 


EVIDENCE  FOR  SURFACE  MOVEMENTS 
A  plot  of  gravity  changes  with  changes  in  elevation 
(figure  4)  shows  a  nearly  linear  relation.  This  means 
that  the  gravity  remeasurements,  where  available,  can 
be  used  to  predict  rapidly  and  help  guide  the  slower 
and  more  costly  releveling  measurements.  From  figure 
4,  we  have  the  least  squares  relation 

Ag  =  — 0.215  AE±  0.026  (s.d.)  (1) 

where  the  elevation  change  AE  in  meters  yields  a 
gravity  change  Ag  in  mgal.  In  the  calculation,  stations 
393,  446,  B156,  and  L77  were  not  included,  either  be- 
cause their  elevation  changes  were  small  (&lt;0.2m)  and 
would  unduly  bias  the  computed  slope  or  because 
uncertainty  in  the  gravity  changes  (±0.10  mgal)  is 
relativel}'  large.  The  least  squares  line  was  also  com- 
puted including  these  four  stations — making  a  total 
of  14  Ag  — AE  points — and  their  effect  is  to  increase 
the  slope  (absolutely)  to  —0.224  mgal/m  and  to 
increase  the  standard  deviation  to  0.040  mgal.  The 
objective  inclusion  of  all  data  &gt;Melds  a  least  squares 
slope  that  is  still  significantly  Jess  than  the  free-air 
gradient  (—0.309  mgal/m)  and  correspond  to  a  Bou- 
guer reduction  density  of  2.0  g/cm^. 

Preferring  equation  (1)  above,  the  reciprocal  rela- 
tion for  geodetic  purposes  becomes,  to  two  significant 
figures: 

^  AE  =  -4.5  (Agio)  (2) 

where  a  is  the  uncertainty  in  the  gravity  change.  For 
example,  for  station  CR14  (table  1),  Ag  =  0.30  mgal 
and  a  =  ±0.04,  making  the  predicted  AE  from  the 
measured  gravity  change  4.5  (0.30  ±  0.04)  =  1.35  m 
±0.18  m.  Other  examples,  such  as  station  446,  would 
not  agree  as  well  \\ith  the  measured  elevation  change. 
A  comparison  of  the  gravity  change  contours  (fig- 
ure 3)   with  the  contour  map  of  elevation  changes 


(Savage  and  others,  this  Bulletin,  figure  2)  further  at- 
tests to  the  close  relation  between  the  two  sets  of 
data.  (The  0.10  mgal  contour  interval  on  the  gravity 
change  map  is  nearly  equivalent  to  the  0.5  m  interval 
on  the  elevation  change  map.)  The  northward  bulge 
in  the  0.10  and  0.20  mgal  contours  in  the  area  east  of 
Pacoima  Reservoir  (figure  3)  is  also  partially  indicated 
by  the  elevation  changes  measured  in  Little  Tujunga 
and  Big  Tujunga  Canyons  (shown  in  parentheses  in 
figure  3,  indicating  that  elevation  changes  were  con- 
verted to  equivalent  gravity  changes).  Because  the 
elevation  changes  in  this  area  are  relative  to  1929  levels 
and  because  the  northward  swing  is  contrary  to  the 
general  pattern  of  vertical  displacement  determined  for 
a  dislocation  model  (Savage  and  others,  this  Bulletin, 
figure  7),  the  elevation  change  may  include  pre-earth- 
quake  secular  uplift  due  to  gradual  clastic  loading  be- 
tween 1929  and  1970.  However,  the  gravity  changes 
in  the  area  east  of  Pacoima  Reservoir  are  relative  to 
initial  gravity  measurements  in  1964  and  1970  and,  if 
anything,  are  larger  than  the  1929-based,  gravity-con- 
\erted  eIe\ation  changes  (figure  3),  suggesting  that 
most  of  the  uplift  between  Pacoima  Reservoir  and  Big 
Tujunga  Canyon  probably  took  place  at  the  time  of 
the  earthquake  and  not  during  the  preceding  40  years. 
One  intriguing  possibility  suggested  by  the  gravity 
data  is  that  local  decreases  in  elevation  were  effected 
by  the  earthquake.  T\\'o  areas  of  possible  elevation  de- 
crease (areas  of  positive  gravity  changes)  are  located 
in  the  mountain  range  both  northeast  and  northwest 
of  the  ma.\-imum  observed  gra\-it\-  decreases  (figure 
3).  These  data  are  less  precise  (±0.10  mgal)  than 
most  of  the  values  obtained  in  other  areas  from  the 
gravity  remeasurements,  but  seven  of  the  values  are 
larger  than  the  estimated  error  and  thus  are  probably 
significant.    The    largest    measured    gravity    increase

(+0.31  mgal),  located  about  1  km  northwest  of  Pa- 
coima  Reservoir  (figure  3),  implies  an  elevation  de- 
crease, using  equation  (2),  of  (—4.5)  (0.31)  or  about 
—  1.4  m.  Savage  and  others  (this  Bulletin)  report  local 
slumping  in  the  vicinity  of  this  point  as  well  as  an 
anomalous  horizontal  displacement  (sec  station  Mesa, 
their  figure  7).  The  amount  of  slumping  was  estimated 
by  Savage  (oral  communication,  1972)  to  have  been 
about  0.7-1.0  m  based  on  the  combined  heights  of 
three  fresh  scarps  located  within  100  m  north  of  the 
station.  If  this  estimate  is  correct,  it  is  reasonable  that 
about  +0.2  mgal  of  the  +0.31  mgal  gravity  change 
is  due  to  surficial  land  motion  and  that  only  the 
difference  of  about  +0.1  mgal  can  be  attributed  to 
regional  tectonic  movement  at  the  time  of  the  earth- 
quake. This  corrected  determination  of  regional  in- 
crease at  Mesa  is  consistent  with  increases  of  +0.02 
to  +0.14  mgal  determined  at  six  nearby  stations.  A 
vertical-angle  remeasurement  of  elevation  is  available 
at  just  one  of  these  stations,  that  at  May  (figure  3), 
which  shows  a  decrease  in  elevation  since  1935  of 
— 0.2  ±  0.4  m  (J.  C.  Savage,  oral  communication, 
1972). 

Another  geodetic  application  of  measuring  gravity 
changes  is  evident  in  the  long  distance  over  which 
the  relative  vertical  movements  can  be  easily  deter- 
mined. In  this  study,  we  not  only  know  that  there  was 
essentialh-  no  vertical  movement  of  the  central  part 
of  San  Fernando  Valley  relative  to  UCLA  within  the 
limits  of  our  remeasurements  (±0.04  mgal  or  the 
elevation-equivalent  of  ±0.18m),  but  we  are  also 
reasonably  sure  that  UCLA  has  not  moved  vertically 
between  1965  and  post-earthquake  1971  relative  to 
our  prime  base  for  California  at  the  USGS  offices  in 
Menlo  Park,  some  320  miles  north.  If  there  were  any 
question  about  a  possible  coincidental  subsidence  of 
Los  Angeles  Basin  and  San  Francisco  Bay,  extensive 
gravity  calibration  runs  between  iMenlo  Park  and  such 
distant  points  as  Mt.  Hamilton,  Sentinel  Dome  in 
Yosemite  Park,  and  Mt.  Lassen  indicate  no  significant 
vertical  movement  since  1962  (Oliver,  1969).  Our 
mea.surements  indicate  that  during  this  period  there 
was  no  gravity  change  and  probably  no  significant 
vertical  movement  of  San  Fernando  Valley  south  of 
the  rupture  zone  relative  to  Los  Angeles  Basin  and  to 
the  specified  mountains  of  central  and  northern  Cali- 
fornia. 

EVIDENCE  FOR  SUBSURFACE  MOVEMENTS 
That  the  ratio  of  the  gravity  changes  to  elevation 
changes  in  northern  San  Fernando  Valley  falls  along 
the  Bouguer  gradient  instead  of  the  free-air  gradient 
(figure  4)  means  that  in  some  way  mass  was  added 
beneath  the  gravity  stations;  that  is,  the  uplift  did  not 
take  place  by  a  simple  vertical  expansion  of  the  north- 
ern block. 

Independent  evidence  supporting  this  conclusion 
comes  from  the  study  of  water  levels  in  wells  within 
the  area  of  uplift,  for,  if  a  dilatation  of  the  ground 
occurred  north  of  the  fault,  the  water  levels  should 
have  dropped  due  to  the  volume  expansion.  Observa- 
tions of  this  phenomenon  are  numerous  for  the  case 
of  tidal  deformation  (.Melchior,  1966,  chapter  6).  In 


the  uplifted  area  north  of  the  Sylmar  fault  segment 
(figure  3),  most  of  the  water  levels  remained  the  same 
(±1  m)  relative  to  the  ground  surface,  according  to 
pre-  and  post-earthquake  records  of  the  Los  Angeles 
Flood  Control  District  (C.  C.  Green,  written  commu- 
nication, 1971).  Monthly  records  for  two  of  these 
wells  are  plotted  in  figure  5;  the  locations  of  the 
wells  arc  shown  on  the  gravity  change  map  (figure  3).

indicated  on  figure  6.  Monthly  measurements  of  water  levels  mode  by

communication,  1971);  change  in  surface  elevations  interpolated  from 
releveling   data  of  Burford  and  others  (1971). 

Corrections  for  the  surface  uplift  have  been  made  and 
the  data  indicate  that  the  water  level,  particularly  in 
well  5958B,  moved  upward  about  the  same  amount  as 
the  surface,  as  if  it  \\ere  confined  in  a  rigid  block.  In 
other  parts  of  the  disturbed  area,  Proctor  (personal 
communication,  1972)  reported  dramatic  drops  of  10- 
30  m  in  five  wells  north  of  the  Tujunga  segment  of 
the  fault  in  Kagel  Canyon  (figure  3);  and  it  may  be 
more  than  coincidence  that  our  one  observation  of

gravity  change  in  the  Kagel  area,  station  559,  plots 
midway  between  the  slopes  corresponding  to  free-air 
and  Bouguer  gradients  (figure  4).  Some  dilatation 
may  have  occurred  locally,  but  the  evidence  from 
both  gravity  and  water  level  changes  indicate  that 
most  of  the  thrust  sheet  moved  as  a  rigid  block  and 
added  mass  to  the  area. 

Evidence  for  the  manner  in  which  mass  was  added 
comes  from  the  analysis  of  change  in  Bouguer  ano- 
malies. The  changes  can  be  interpreted  using  the  same 
methods  as  the  interpretation  of  Bouguer  anomalies 
themselves.  In  this  case,  detailed  measurements  along 
Foothill  Boulevard  (figure  6)  show  that  the  decrease 
in  gravity  of  0.34  mgal  north  of  the  Sylmar  segment 
of  the  fault  is  nearly  nullified  by  making  a  correction 
for  the  vertical  movement  of  the  station  (free-air 
effect)  and  the  attraction  of  the  material  making  up 
the  elevation  change,  assumed  to  have  a  density  of 
2.0  g/cm^  (Bouguer  correction).  We  are  able  to  ex- 
plain most  of  the  gravity  change  by  a  simple  stacking 
of  surficial  layers,  having  a  density  approximately  that 
of  alluvium,  on  the  pre-earthquake  surface  level. 

Although  the  changes  in  Bouguer  anomalies — grav- 
ity changes  corrected  for  changes  in  surface  elevation 
— are  small  (.08  mgal  or  less),  they  do  form  a  pattern 
of  gradually  increasing  negative  changes  north  of  Han- 
sen Reservoir  and  then  rising  abruptly  at  station  449, 
just  south  of  the  Sylmar  rupture  and  remaining  slightly 
positive  northward  as  far  as  Olive  View.  Although  the 
data  for  any  given  point  have  a  statistical  uncertainty 
of  ±0.06  mgal,  most  of  the  points  are  probably  good 
to  0.02-0.03  mgal  as  suggested  by  the  continuity  of 
the  pattern  itself.  To  understand  these  data,  we  need 
to  consider  what  subsurface  mass  changes  might  have 


taken  place  between  the  initial  gravity  measurements 
in  1958  and  post-earthquake  1971. 

The  most  obvious  change  in  mass — and  the  only  one 
for  which  any  data  are  available — is  due  to  water  table 
fluctuation.  Water  levels  in  selected  wells  have  been 
measured  in  the  northern  San  Fernando  X'^allcy  by  the 
Los  Angeles  County  Flood  Control  District  since  1928; 
these  records  (mostly  unpublished)  show  that  the 
water  table  is  at  a  depth  of  30  to  50  m  and  has  been 
dropping  steadily  since  about  1950.  Figure  8  shows 
this  drop  in  a  well  located  just  north  of  the  Sylmar 
rupture  \\here  the  gravity  decreased  about  0.26  mgal 
(#5969  in  figure  3).  In  this  well,  the  water  level  had 
dropped  about  15  m  between  1958  and  the  fall  of 
1970  and  then  rose  an  anomalously  large  8  m  between 
October  1970  and  iMarch  1971,  leaving  a  net  change 
of  about  —9  m  between  the  times  that  the  rsvo  sets 
of  gravity  measurements  were  made.  Assuming  a  28 
percent  porosity  for  the  alluvium  at  a  depth  of  about 
50  m — a  porosity  that  corresponds  to  the  measured 
saturated  density  of  2.2  g/cm^  (Corbato,  1963,  figure 
6)  and  a  grain  density  of  2.67  g/cm^ — the  effect  on 
gravity  of  the  9-m  drop  in  water  level  is  about  — 0.11 
mgal,  using  an  infinite  sheet  approximation  for  the 
water  table.  This  gravity  effect  is  obviously  signifi- 
cant, being  slightly  larger  than  the  largest  change  in 
Bouguer  anomalies  observed  along  section  A-A'  (—0.08 
mgal  at  station  446).  Thus,  some  attempt  at  correcting 
the  change  in  Bouguer  anomalies  for  the  change  in 
level  of  the  water  table  is  necessary. 

Unfortunately,  most  of  the  water  wells  near  Foot- 
hill Boulevard  for  which  1958  water  levels  are  avail- 
able were  subsequently  closed  off  by  a  court  decision, 
and  for  both  1958  and  1971  measurements  at  only  two

wells  within  1  km  of  Foothill  Boulevard  arc  available 
(figure  6).  An  accurate  calculation  of  the  gravity 
change  expected  from  the  change  in  level  of  the  water 
table  is  impossible.  However,  a  rough  two-dimensional 
model  of  the  water  table  changes  along  A-A'  from 
1958  to  1970  to  1971  has  been  made  in  figure  6  by 
taking  differences  along  the  profile  between  a  1958 
contour  map  prepared  b\-  the  California  State  Water 
Rights  Board  (1962,  plate  30)  and  another  contour 
map  for  fall  1970  made  by  the  Los  Angeles  City  De- 
partment of  Water  and  Power.  The  fall  1970  profile 
(figure  6)  has  been  updated  to  March  1971  using 
seven  well  measurements  (circled  dots  in  figure  6) 
made  available  b\'  the  I-os  Angeles  County  Flood  Con- 
trol District.  The  levels  in  five  of  these  wells  did  not 
change  more  than  2  m  between  fall  1970  and  spring 
1971,  an  example  being  well  #5958B,  the  monthly  data 
for  which  is  shown  in  figure  8.  B\'  contrast,  both  wells 
#4860B  and  #5969  on  opposite  sides  of  the  Sylmar 
rupture  had  large  seasonal  variations;  the  variation  of 
4!/:  m  at  #4860B  was  gradual  and  did  not  result  from 
the  earthquake  effects,  except  for  perhaps  0.2  m,  the 
amount  of  surface  uplift  (figure  5). 

The  surprising  part  of  the  change  in  water  table 
between  1958  and  1971  is  the  rise  of  3  to  6  m  south 
of  the  Sylmar  rupture.  This  result  was  unsuspected 
because  of  the  decrease  in  Bouguer  anomalies  over  the 
same  area.  Moreover,  the  decrease  in  gravity  of  —0.15 
mgal  2  miles  south  of  Van  Norman  Reservoir  (figure 
3)  is  consistent  with  a  lowering  of  the  water  level  of 
about  8  m  between  1958  and  1970.  Perhaps  the  rise 
south  of  the  Sylmar  rapture,  if  real,  is  a  result  of 
diffusion  of  water  from  Hansen  Reservoir,  which  has 
been  intermittently  filled  since  1952.  In  any  case,  the 
abrupt  drop  in  water  table  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
Sylmar  rupture  seems  to  be  adcquatcl\'  documented, 
and  we  have  computed  the  gravitational  effect  of  the 
water  level  changes  shown  by  the  stippled  area  (figure 
6).  The  computation  was  done  on  an  IBM  360/65 
computer  using  a  U.S.  Geological  Surve\-  modification 
of  TaK\  ani's  two-dimensional  program  (Talwani  and 
others,  1959).  The  results  of  the  computation  are 
plotted  at  horizontal  intervals  of  about  0.22  km 
(crosses  in  figure  6)  and  indicate  that  the  effect  of 
the  change  in  water  table  is  indeed  of  the  same  order 
of  magnitude  as  the  change  in  Bouguer  anomalies,  but 
of  opposite  sign,  being  positive  south  of  the  Sylmar 
rupture  and  negative  to  the  north. 

The  residual  gravity  change  (that  is,  the  difference 
between  the  computed  effect  of  the  change  in  water 
table  and  the  change  in  Bouguer  anomalies)  is  illus- 
trated in  figure  7  (upper  profile).  We  wish  to  stress 
the  uncertainties  in  this  profile,  the  parent  anomal_\' 
change  itself  being  Iargcl\-  statistical!)-  insignificant. 
However,  we  believe  that  the  general  form  of  the 
residual  is  significant  and  that  it  poses  a  curious  con- 
straint on  dislocation  models  of  subsurface  movements 
associated  with  the  San  Fernando  earthquake.  We  have 
sketched  r\\o  subsurface  models  of  densit\'  changes 
(figure  7)  which  gcncralls'  satisfy  the  gravity  residual 
and  make  some  intrinsic  sense  i)ur  which  are  difficult 
to  reconcile  with  the  expected  density  changes  based 


on   published   concepts  of  subsurface  movements  as 
illustrated  in  the  generali/.ed  section  (figure  7). 

In  model  1,  a  decrease  in  density  of  0.28  g/cm'  of  a 
10-m-thick  plate  of  material  at  a  depth  of  about  120  m 
is  invoked,  together  with  a  similar  density  increase  to 
the  north  of  the  fault  in  the  form  of  a  step.  The  step 
could  cither  be  geometric  (as  pictured)  or  in  the 
densit\'  increase.  Geologically,  model  1  could  result 
from  a  10-  to  12-mctcr  lowering  of  a  perched  water 
table  south  of  the  fault  combined  with  the  steplike 
rise  to  the  north  but  could  not  result  from  just  dis- 
placements of  beds  with  different  densities  associated 
with  reverse  faulting.  The  effect  is  too  large  to  be 
explained  by  a  movement  of  only  2  m  by  a  scries 
of  beds  who.se  total  integrated  contrast  is  limited  to 
about  2.7  —  2.2  =  0.5  g/cm^.  Model  1  is  also  shown 
in  the  generalized  section  at  true  scale. 

Model  2  is  also  not  very  appealing  geologically.  It 
represents  the  other  end  of  a  mathematical  bracket 
wherein  a  minimum  change  in  density  contrast  of  O.OI 
g/cm^  is  assumed  to  have  taken  place  throughout  the 
upper  250  m  of  material,  the  change  again  being  nega- 
tive to  the  south  and  positive  to  the  north  of  the  Syl- 
mar rupture.  A  density  change  of  0.005-0.010  g/cm' 
implies  a  strain  release  of  2  —  4X10"^  and  could 
conceivably  occur  in  the  upper  300  m  of  material  de- 
picted in  figure  7  as  the  result  of  strain  relaxation 
associated  with  elastic  rebound;  but  again,  the  ex- 
pected change  from  elastic  rebound  is  in  the  wrong 
direction,  being  negative  to  the  north  of  the  fault 
(see  Savage  and  others,  this  Bulletin,  figure  3).  We  are 
not  satisfied  with  the  residual  change  and  the  models 
(figure  7)  and  hope  that  additional  data  being  obtained 
will  help  clarify  the  problem.  As  an  alternative,  for 
example,  if  the  residual  gravity  low  south  of  the  Syl- 
mar rupture  is  not  real  and  better  data  demonstrate 
that  the  horizontal  extent  of  gradients  at  the  edges  of 
the  anomalies  are  larger,  then  the  gravity'  high  to  the 
north  of  the  fault  can  be  explained  in  terms  of  the 
displacements  of  the  bottom  1  to  2  m  of  beds  by 
higher  density  material  beneath  as  indicated  sche- 
matically b\'  the  shaded  wedges  in  the  generalized 
section   (figure  7). 

CHANGE  IN  THE  STATE  OF  ISOSTATIC  BALANCE 
The  state  of  isostatic  balance  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  is  not  well  known  nor  is  its  nature  under- 
stood. Some  degree  of  regional  balance  is  indicated  by 
a  northeastward  decrease  in  Bouguer  gravity  anoma- 
lies, which  generally  corresponds  to  an  increase  in 
the  average  elevation  of  topography  (Gilluly  and 
others,  1968,  figures  10-15).  The  general  level  of 
Bouguer  anomalies  in  the  area  of  the  gravity  change 
(figure  3)  is  — 70  to  — 80  mgal  (Corbato,  1963,  Map 
2),  and  these  values  are  reduced  to  isostatic  anomalies 
of  0  to  — 20  ingal,  depending  on  the  depth  of  com- 
pensation and  the  isostatic  system  assumed  in  the 
reduction  (Duerksen,  1949,  station  numbers  246,  314 
and  3151.  Granncll  and  Bichlcr  (1971)  have  reported 
more  detailed  gravity  measurements  showing  that  the 
mountains  ha\c  little  effect  on  this  regional  gravity 
gradient,   implying  that  there   is   no   local   mountain

root  beneath  the  San  Gabriel  block.  This  conclusion 
is  supported  by  the  interpretation  of  seismic  data  from 
the  Cannikan  explosion  (iMellman,  1972)  but  in  dis- 
agreement with  the  interpretation  of  seismic  refraction 
and  reflection  data  of  Roller  and  Healy  (1963,  figure 
10),  who  concluded  that  a  normal  30-km  crust  be- 
neath Los  Angeles  thickens  to  about  40  km  beneath 
the  San  Gabriel  Alountains.  Interpretation  of  Roller 
and  Healy's  seismic  data  is  inconclusive  as  to  the  com- 
pleteness of  compensation. 

Whatever  state  of  compensation  existed  before  the 
earthquake,  it  is  clear  that  the  region  of  uplift  and 
gravity  change  (figure  3)  is  now  slightly  heavier. 
Average  free-air  anomalies  are  regarded  as  one  measure 
of  isostatic  compensation;  in  this  case,  free-air  anoma- 
lies increased  algebraically  by  an  amount  equal  to  the 
negative  of  the  difference  in  slopes  between  the  free- 
air  gradient  ( —  0.309  mgal/m)  and  the  least-squares 
fit  of  the  changes  in  gravity  to  the  change  in  eleva- 
tion data  (—0.215  mgal/m)  times  the  elevation 
change  (AE)  at  any  station;  that  is,  0.094AE.  This 
simple  formula,  of  course,  is  an  approximation  and 
subject  to  the  same  local  variations  as  the  residual 
changes  in  the  Bouguer  anomalies,  which  average 
about  +0.1  mgal  over  the  area  of  uplift  between  the 
Sylmar  fault  segment  and  Olive  View^  (figure  7).  If 
we  take  AE  ^  1  m  as  the  average  value  of  the  uplift 
in  area,  the  average  free-air  anomaly  increased  about 
0.2  1)1  gal. 

Isostatic  anomalies  did  not  increase  as  much.  They 
are  determined  by  adding  the  gravitational  effect  of 
some  perfectly  compensating  mass  system  to  Bouguer 
anomalies.  The  changes  in  isostatic  anomalies  asso- 
ciated with  the  earthquake  (AIAi)  are  the  sums  at 
various  locations  (i)  of  the  residual  changes  in  Bou- 
guer anomalies  (ABAi)  plus  the  effect  of  changes  in 
a  compensating  model  necessary  to  support  the  added 
mass  (AICi);  that  is, 

AIAi  =  ABA,  +  AIQ. 
As  we  have  seen  in  the  previous  section,  ABA,  is  posi- 
tive north  of  the  Sylmar  segment,  negative  to  the 
south,  and  nowhere  exceeds  0.18  mgal  (figure  7).  AIQ 
was  obtained  by  assuming  an  Airy-Heiskanen  scheme 
of  compensation  for  a  crustal  thickness  of  T  =  20 
km — this  will  give  a  maximum  estimate  (see  Oliver, 
1960) — and  adding  an  increment  of  crustal  thickness 
of  (2.67/0.6)  AEj  or  a  maximum  of  about  10  m  on 
to  the  bottom  of  the  presumed  mountain  root.  For  a 
two-dimension  approximation,  the  calculation  reduces 
to  measuring  a  series  of  plane  angles  (A0)  subtended 
at  the  earth's  surface  by  a  series  of  semi-infinite  hori- 
zontal slabs,  and  using  the  relation

duces to  10

where  0i  is  in  degrees.  For  the  mirrored  geometrj^ 


of  uplift  along  A-A'  at  a  depth  of  20  km  (figure  3) 
S0i  directly  above  the  compensating  mass  is  110°, 
A0  varying  from  3°  to  30°.  Titus  the  niaximuiii 
change  in  isostatic  correction,  AlCmax  =  (.0258) 
(110)/180  ~  0.02  vigal.  Additional  angular  measure- 
ments show  that  the  effect  drops  off  very  slowly  to 
the  north  or  south,  becoming  about  half  at  a  hori- 
zontal distance  of  tS  km.  The  effect  of  increasing  the 
crustal  thickness  to  T  =  40  km  is  to  decrease  the  at- 
traction by  about  20  percent  (0.004  mgal).  The 
change  in  isostatic  anomalies  within  the  area  of  uplift 
is  largely  determined  by  the  change  in  Bouguer  anom- 
alies, but  a  small  positive  change  of  0.01  mgal  ex- 
tends over  much  of  the  San  Gabriel  block. 

The  above  analysis  quantifies  the  conclusion  that 
additional  mass  was  introduced  (probably  from  the 
north)  that  has  not  yet  been  compensated.  Some  of 
the  additional  mass  may  be  effectively  compensated  by 
the  rsvo  areas  of  positive  gravity  change  (figure  3) 
which  indicate  a  drop  in  elevation  from  mass  removal. 
The  axis  of  maximum  gravity  increase  forms  an  in- 
verted "U"  and  is  partially  coincident  with  the  north- 
ern limit  of  the  area  of  aftershocks  (figure  2).  This 
relation  supports  the  conclusion  of  Wesson  and  others 
(1971)  that  the  envelope  of  aftershocks  represents  the 
edge  of  a  dislocated  thrust  sheet.  Mass  removal  and 
subsidence  could  be  expected  at  the  northern  edge  of 
the  south\\'ard-moving  sheet  similar  to  the  formation 
of  a  bergschrund  as  glaciers  pull  away  from  their 
immobile  ice  adhering  to  the  headwall  of  a  valley.  Per- 
haps further  adjustments,  not  necessarily  in  our  life- 
time, ma\'  provide  infonnation  on  the  state  of  com- 
pensation of  the  San  Gabriel  block.  For  example,  if  the 
southern  part  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  had  been 
in  perfect  isostatic  balance  before  the  earthquake,  we 
would  expect  the  block,  in  the  absence  of  other  tec- 
tonic forces,  eventually  to  sink  partly  back  toward 
its  pre-earthquake  level  by  an  amount  nih/02,  where 
oi  is  the  average  density  of  the  thrust  plate,  Oo  the 
density  of  whatever  substratum  is  buoying  up  the 
mountain  range  (upper  mantle.'),  and  h  the  average 
change  in  elevation  of  the  uplifted  area.  Using  oi  = 
2.67  g/cm^  02  =  3.27  g/cm^,  and  h  ==  1  m,  the  present 
uplifted  surface  would  need  to  sink  0.S2  vi  to  regain 
its  former  state  of  balance.  Partial  fall-back  has  been 
observed  in  connection  with  other  earthquakes.  A 
striking  example  is  the  1960  Chilean  earthquake,  where 
a  shoreline  was  raised  1  ',&gt;  m  and  subsequently  dropped 
about  70  percent  of  the  previous  rise  to  about  Vi  m 
five  months  after  the  earthquake  (Saint-Amand,  1961, 
p.  16). 

If  the  San  Gabriel  block  was  overcompensated 
prior  to  the  earthquake,  as  is  more  likely  the  case  judg- 
ing by  geologic  evidence  for  the  recenc\-  of  large  verti- 
cal movements — these  movements  predominate  for  the 
last  five  million  years — one  would  expect  the  block  to 
continue  rising  by  a  series  of  discontinuous  events.  On 
the  other  hand,  if  the  mountains  north  of  San  Fernando 
are  undercompensated,  one  would  expect  the  area  to 
be  sinking,  which  is  contrary  to  geologic  evidence,  and 
moreover  to  continue  sinking  more  than  the  0.82  m 
calculated  above  for  return  to  a  state  of  isostatic 
balance.

Isostaric  forces  probably  play  a  secondary  role  in 
the  tectonic  movements  of  the  San  Gabriel  block,  the 
primary  role  being  thought  by  many  geologists  to  be 
a  horizontal  north-south  compression  with  the  Trans- 
verse Ranges  acting  as  a  buttress  beneath  which  a 
southern  coastal  plate  is  being  thrust  (Wentworth  and 
Yerkes,  1971,  p.  6).  Perhaps  the  measurement  of  future 
gravity  changes  in  this  area  would  help  resolve  some 
of  these  questions  and  provide  added  evidence  of  sub- 
surface movements.  To  this  end,  we  have  prepared 
detailed  descriptions,  sketch  maps,  and/or  pictures  of 
the  87  gravity  stations  listed  in  table  1  and  recommend 
that  most  of  these  stations  be  remeasured  every  two 
years  to  monitor  future  changes.  Figure  9  is  an  example 
of  these  station  descriptions  and  describes  the  prime- 
base  MW-2  at  the  California  Institute  of  Technology. 
This  material  is  on  file  at  the  offices  of  the  Cali- 
fornia Division  of  Alines  and  Geology  and  the  U.S. 
Geological  Survey  (Robbins  and  others,  1973.) 

CONCLUDING  REMARKS 
The  San  Fernando  earthquake  presented  the  best 
opportunity  we  have  had  for  studying  the  relation 
between  changes  in  gravity  and  elevation  as  extensive 
measurements  had  been  made  in  this  metropolitan 
suburb.  The  AG-AE  plot  in  figure  4  shows  convinc- 
ingly that  the  gravity  changes  are  related  to  the  eleva- 
tion changes  by  a  Bouguer  gradient  rather  than  a 
free-air  gradient.  The  linearity  of  the  relation  Ag  = 
— 0.215AE  ±  0.026  at  San  Fernando  indicates  that  grav- 
ity can  probably  be  used  in  future  earthquakes  to  out- 
line rapidly  an  area  of  elevation  change  relative  even 
to  points  as  much  as  1000  km  away  if  the  change  is 
greater  than  ±0.3  m.  This  method  could  be  most 
important  in  a  very  large  earthquake. 

The  detailed  measurements  along  Foothill  Boulevard 
(figure  6)  place  serious  constraints  upon  subsurface 
movements  attributed  to  the  reverse-oblique  faulting 
recognized  at  the  surface.  These  constraints  are  made 
somewhat  uncertain  by  the  lack  of  accurate  knowledge 


of  ground  water  changes  between  1958  and  1971;  but, 
in  general,  we  believe  that  the  tectonic  movements 
involved  the  addition  of  mass  to  the  area  and  that  most 
of  the  gravity  change  was  caused  by  a  simple  stacking 
of  surficial  layers  on  the  pre-earthquake  surface  level, 
as  might  be  expected  in  thrust  faulting. 

Between  the  Sylmar  fault  segment  and  Olive  View 
Hospital,  there  is  a  curious  relation  between  the  loss 
in  mass  associated  with  the  withdrawal  of  ground 
water  since  about  1950  and  the  excess  mass  now  im- 
posed on  the  pre-earthquake  surface.  They  are  7iearly 
equal;  that  is,  the  addition  of  mass  at  the  time  of  the 
earthquake  (top  curve,  figure  6)  in  a  sense  compensates 
isostaticallv  for  the  loss  of  water  mass  subtracted  b)' 
pumping  (stippled  area,  bottom  section,  figure  6).  This 
relation  must  be  fortuitous,  for  the  maximum  with- 
drawal was  only  about  25  m  (figure  8);  at  28  percent 
porosity,  this  amounts  to  a  water  column  only  7  m 
thick.  Aioreover,  the  ^\'ithdrawal  of  water  under  Bur- 
bank,  in  the  southern  part  of  San  Fernando  Valley, 
has  been  significantly  greater  (California  State  Water 
Rights  Board,  1962,  plate  31)  and  no  major  earth- 
quakes are  known  to  have  occurred  there.  If  a  region 
is  already  strained  by  vertical  extension  nearly  to  the 
point  of  rupture,  a  slight  reduction  in  load  such  as  the 
lowering  of  the  water  table  by  25  m  could  conceivably 
trigger  the  rupture. 

Gravity  might  be  a  useful  tool  for  monitoring  the 
water  table  where  inadequate  well  data  are  available, 
as  well  as  for  rapidly  detecting  vertical  movements  and 
subsurface  mass  changes.  About  14,000  new  gravity 
stations  were  established  in  1968-70  throughout  Cali- 
fornia at  intervals  of  2  to  5  miles  (Chapman,  1969; 
Oliver,  1969;  Rietman,  1969);  20  to  50  percent  of  these 
stations  are  reoccupiable  to  within  0.1  m  vertically 
and  1  m  horizontally  (equivalent  to  a  repeatability  of 
±.03  mgal).  This  study,  along  with  Barnes'  (1966) 
work  on  the  Alaskan  earthquake,  indicates  a  need  for 
accurate,  reoccupiable  gravity  stations  in  other  seis- 
mically  active  regions  throughout  the  world.

CHAPTER  17 


Magnetic  Anomalies  and  Active  Faults 
in  the  San  Fernando  Area 

by  Rodger  H.  Chapman  ^  and  Gordon  W.  Chase  ^ 


Magnetic  observations  in  the  northern  part  of 
the  San  Fernando  Valley  by  the  California  Division 
of  Mines  and  Geology  show  that  faults  that  displaced 
Quaternary  alluvium  during  the  earthquake  of  Feb- 
ruary 9,  1971,  are  commonly  marked  by  magnetic 
anomalies.  These  anomalies  are  probably  caused  by 
abrupt  changes  in  thickness  of  the  alluvium  and  pos- 
sibly by  the  presence  of  other  magnetite-bearing  rocks 
in  the  vicinity  of  the  fault  zones. 

In  this  part  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley  area,  the 
alluvium  is  derived  in  large  part  from  igneous  rocks 
which  crop  out  in  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  to  the 
north  and  east  (Oakeshott,  1958,  p.  117).  Some  of 
these  igneous  rocks,  which  range  in  composition  from 
anorthosite  and  gabbro  to  granite,  contain  a  significant 
amount  of  magnetite-ilmenite;  thus  the  alluvium  may 
have  a  relatively  high  magnetic  susceptibility  in  com- 
parison to  most  of  the  Tertiary  and  Quaternary  sedi- 
mentary rocks  with  which  it  is  in  contact  in  this  area. 
Certain  other  sedimentary  rocks,  particularly  the 
Pleistocene  Saugus  Formation,  may  also  contain  a 
relatively  high  proportion  of  magnetite-ilmenite. 

Because  of  the  association  of  magnetic  anomalies 
and  faults  in  the  San  Fernando  area,  magnetic  methods 
were  used  by  the  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology  to 
guide  additional  geophysical  work  and  augment  geo- 
logic mapping,  especially  in  parts  of  the  area  where 
surface  breaks  did  not  occur  during  the  recent  earth- 
quake. This  report  is  a  brief  summars'  of  the  initial 
results  of  the  geophysical  measurements. 


FIELD  WORK 

Field  measurements  consisted  of  one  or  more 
lines  of  magnetometer  readings  oriented  approximately 
normal  to  the  trend  of  the  known  or  suspected  faults 


This  paper  was  presented  by  Dr.  Chapman  at  the  annual 
meeting  of  the  Society  of  Exploration  Geophysicists,  held 
at  Anaheim,  California,  November  2G-30,  1972.  It  has  been 
released  for  publication  by  the  Editor  of  Geophysics.

under  investigation.  Station  spacings  generall&gt;'  were  at 
intervals  of  from  50  to  100  feet.  The  measurements 
were  taken  with  either  an  Askania  vertical-intensity 
magnetic  balance  with  a  sensitivity  of  about  10  gam- 
mas per  scale  division  or  a  Jalander  vertical-intensity 
fluxgate  magnetometer  with  a  reading  accuracy  of 
about  10-15  gammas. 

In  some  parts  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley  area  the 
usefulness  of  ground  magnetic  measurements  is  limited 
by  the  presence  of  various  man-made  structures  con- 
taining iron  or  steel.  Particular!}-  common  are  urban- 
ized areas  with  associated  utility  lines,  reinforced- 
concrete  highways,  canal  linings,  bridges,  railroads, 
pipelines,  transmission  towers,  and  culverts.  Some  of 
these  structures  disturb  the  magnetic  field  for  hori- 
zontal distances  of  several  hundred  feet.  An  attempt 
was  made  to  avoid  such  magnetic  disturbances;  but, 
even  in  areas  that  were  believed  to  be  relatively  free 
of  these  effects,  unknown  buried  metallic  objects 
probabi)'  contribute  to  the  "noise"  seen  in  the  results. 

AREAS  STUDIED 
Little  Tujunga  Canyon 

In  Little  Tujunga  Canyon,  the  San  Fernando 
fault  zone  is  marked  b\'  two  prominent  fault  scarps 
which  formed  in  the  Februar\-  9,  1971,  earthquake. 
The  southernmost  scarp,  or  Tujunga  segment,  showed 
a  vertical  displacement  of  40  to  50  cm.;  the  northern 
most  scarp,  or  Lakeview  segment,  showed  a  displace- 
ment of  20  to  50  cm.  (Barrows  and  others,  1971). 

Line  A-A',  plate  3  and  figure  1,  is  a  short,  east- 
trending  line  w  hich  crosses  the  Quaternar\'  alluvium  in 
the  can\on  and  is  close  to  outcrops  of  Tertiary  sedi- 
mentar\-  rocks  (Modclo  Formation)  on  both  sides  of 
the  wash  (Oakeshott,  1958,  plate  1).  This  line  is 
included  to  show  the  magnetic  effect  of  the  alluvium. 
Although  the  data  are  characteristically  "noisy",  the 
magnetometer  profile  shows  a  distinct  positive  anoni- 
al\-  which  corresponds  to  the  location  of  the  stream 
wash.  The  amplitude  of  this  anomaly  probably  repre- 
sents,  in   a   general   wa\-,   the   thickness  of   alluvium

present  along  this  particular  cross  section  of  the  wash. 

Line  R-B',  plate  ?  and  figure  1,  is  a  line  which 
follows  the  gcnti\-  sloping  wash,  upstream  in  a  north 
to  northeast  direction,  and  crosses  the  traces  of  both 
faults  mentioned  above.  The  magnetic  profile  shows 
many  irregularities,  most  of  which  arc  probably 
caused  b\'  \ariations  in  the  concentration  of  natural 
magnetic  materia!  in  the  alluvium.  The  most  notable 
feature  of  this  profile,  iiowevcr,  is  the  steep  magnetic 
gradient  located  close  to  the  position  of  tiie  Tujunga 
segment  scarp.  This  gradient  appears  as  a  step  in  the 
profile  (downward  to  the  north)  with  a  magnitude 
of  about  200  gammas.  \Micther  or  not  an  anoniah'  is 
associated  with  the  trace  of  the  Lakeview  segment 
on  this  profile  is  difficult  to  determine  because  of  the 
level  of  the  background  "noise". 

According  to  R.  J.  Proctor  (written  communica- 
tion, 1971)  seismic  profiles  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Tu- 
junga segment  scarp  in  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  show 
a  layer  with  a  velocit\'  of  8000  feet  per  second  at  a 
depth  of  about  12  feet,  just  north  of  the  scarp,  and  a 
layer  with  a  velocity  of  6500  feet  per  second  at  a 
depth  of  about  50  feet,  south  of  the  scarp.  There  is 
also  a  ground  water  "cascade"  or  change  in  ground 
water  level  at  about  the  same  location  (California  State 
Water  Rights  Board  Report,  1962,  v.  1,  plate  30).

Plate  3  shows  tiic  location  of  four  prcliminarv  norrli- 
trending  magnetometer  lines,  Ci-C'i,  Q-Co,  Ca-C'a, 


C,-C'j,  located  about  half  a  mile  east  of  Lakeview 
Terrace  Sanitarium.  In  this  area.  Barrows  and  others 
(1971)  have  recorded  a  vertical  displacement  on  the 
south-facing  scarp  in  the  range  of  55  to  80  cm.  Mag- 
netic profile  C''-C^'  (figure  2)  shows  a  steep  gradient 
close  to  the  location  of  the  known  fault  trace  which 
results  in  an  abrupt  increase  in  the  magnetic  field  of 
about  .300  gammas  from  north  to  south.  Profiles 
Ci-C'i,  Ca-C':;  are  east  of  and  parallel  to  Ci-C'j.  Each 
of  these  profiles  also  shows  a  steep  magnetic  gradient; 
howe\er,  the  position  of  the  anomal\-  apparcnth'  di- 
verges southward  from  the  mapped  scarp  from  west 
to  east.  Tills  suggests  that  if  the  anomal\'  is  caused  by 
a  buried  fault  scarp,  the  surface  ruptures  during  the 
recent  earthquake  did  not  follow  the  older,  or  at 
least  most  prominent,  fault  zone  in  this  direction  (see 
plate  3). 

The  results  of  seismic  work  in  the  area  near  pro- 
file Ci-C'4  by  Proctor  (written  communication,  1971), 
indicate  a  la&gt;er  with  a  velocit\-  of  8000  feet  per  second 
at  a  depth  of  about  16  feet  to  the  north  of  the  fault 
scarp,  and  a  la\er  with  the  same  velocity,  at  a  depth 
of  about  24  feet,  south  of  the  scarp.  If  the  magnetic 
susceptibility  of  the  alluvium  were  approximately 
constant  throughout  the  area,  one  would  expect  the 
size  of  tiie  observed  anomaly  to  be  roughly  propor- 
tional to  the  fault  displacement  in  the  alluvium.  In  a 
comparison  between  the  results  obtained  in  Little 
Tujunga  Cannon  and  Big  Tujunga  W^ash,  however, 
the  reverse  is  observed:  The  anomal\-  in  Big  Tujunga 
Wash  is  the  larger  of  the  two,  but  the  change  in 
thickness  of  alluvium  (from  .seismic  data)  is  smaller, 
riiis  is  evidence  that  the  efl^ecti\c  magnetic  siisccpti- 
l)iiir\'  (iience,  magnetite  content)  of  the  alluvium 
varies  appreciabh'  from  one  place  to  another  as  might 
be  expected.

Magnetometer  lines  located  in  Big  Tujunga  Wash 
east  of  tlie  eastern  end  of  the  mapped  tectonic  break- 
age failed  to  provide  evidence  for  any  subsurface  con- 
tinuation of  the  fault  zone  in  this  direction. 

The  Veterans  Fault 

In  the  northern  part  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley 
near  tiie  foothills  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains,  there 
was  extensive  damage  to  structures  as  a  result  of  the 
February  9  earthquake;  but  there  is  onl\'  one  known 
tectonic  surface  break  between  the  Golden  State 
Freeway,  on  the  west,  and  Pacoima  Wash  on  the  east 
(U.S.  Geological  Survey,  staff,  1971,  p.  71).  This 
break,  the  \'^eterans  fault,  is  located  mainly  in  a  par- 
tially completed  housing  subdivision  east  of  the  U.S. 
\'^eterans  Hospital  and  west  of  Pacoima  AVash  (Bur- 
rows and  others,  1971).  North  of  the  fault  are  found 
exposures  of  the  Pleistocene  Saugus  and  Pacoima 
Formations;  south  of  the  fault,  terrace  deposits  (older 
Quaternary  alluvium,  see  plate  2). 

A  series  of  four  short,  closely  spaced  magnetom- 
eter lines  Ji-J'i,  J2-J'2,  Js-J's,  and  ]^-]\  (plate  3  and 
figure  3)  was  obtained  over  the  fault  break  in 
an  unfinished  part  of  the  subdivision  east  of  Rajah 
Street.  Three  of  these  four  profiles  are  marked  by 
very  distinct  magnetic  anomalies,  or  sharp  breaks  in 
the  profiles,  with  amplitudes  of  between  100  and  200 
gammas  each,  located  close  to  the  known  position  of 
the  fault.  On  these  profiles  the  magnetic  field  increases 
from  the  Pacoima  Formation  on  the  north  side  of  the 
fault  to  alluvium  on  the  south  side.  The  south  end  of 
the  fourth  profile,  Jj-J's,  is  apparently  disturbed  by  a 
magnetic  anomaly  caused  by  metallic  objects  near 
Tucker  Street. 

Magnetometer  lines  were  run  both  east  and  west 
of  the  known  surface  break  of  the  Veterans  fault. 


Lines  in  Pacoima  Wash,  to  the  east,  show  no  evidence 
for  an  extension  of  the  fault  in  this  direction.  Further- 
more, no  surface  breaks  were  found  in  the  alluvium 
in  this  area  following  the  February  earthquake  to  sug- 
gest a  hidden  fault  zone  (Barrows  and  others,  1971). 
To  the  west,  magnetic  anomalies  which  may  represent 
a  continuation  of  the  fault  were  found  on  a  line  along 
Loop  Canyon  crossing  Hubbard  Street  (west  of  Can- 
dlewood  Drive),  and  on  lines  northeast  of  Simshaw 
Street,  south  of  the  Veterans  Hospital  (lines  K,  L,  and 
M,  plate  3  and  figure  3).  Although  work  is  still  in- 
complete in  this  area,  the  anomalies  are  evidence  that 
the  \''eterans  fault  continues  from  the  mapped  break 
in  a  direction  just  south  of  west  through  a  field  below 
the  \'eterans  Hospital  (see  plate  3).  From  this  area,  it 
ma\'  continue  into  the  housing  subdivision  southwest 
of  Simshaw  Street. 

The  Veterans  fault  anomah'  appears  to  increase 
from  approximately  100  gammas  in  amplitude  at  the 
eastern  end  of  the  mapped  surface  break  (line  Ji-J'i) 
to  about  200  gammas  on  the  Loop  Canyon  line  (K) 
and  to  nearly  300  gammas  on  the  lines  south  of  the 
\'eterans  Hospital  (lines  L  and  .M).  This  ma\-  indicate 
a  westward  increase  in  either  the  oflFset  on  the  fault 
or  in  the  contrast  in  magnetic  susceptibility.  The  large 
amplitude  of  this  anomaly,  which  is  comparable  to 
that  found  on  the  Tujunga  and  Lakeview  fault  seg- 
ments, suggests  that  the  \^eterans  fault  is  also  a  sig- 
nificant structural  break  which  must  have  a  history  of 
movement  in  Holocene  geologic  time. 

If  there  is  a  significant  western  extension  of  the 
\'eterans  fault  zone,  as  suggested  by  the  present  work, 
tectonic  activity  along  this  zone  could  explain  the 
notable  damage  which  occurred  at  the  \^cterans  Hos- 
pital, even  though  no  tectonic  surface  breaks  have 
been  mapped  in  this  area.  In  the  area  west  of  the  Vet- 
erans Hospital,  no  magnetic  anomalies,  which  could

(plate  3). 

The  Mission  Wells  and  Sylmar  Fault  Segments 

The  Mission  Wells  and  S\lmar  fault  segments  are 
both  located  chiefl&gt;'  in  the  relativelv  flat  part  of  San 
Fernando  \'alle\'  at  sonic  distance  from  tiie  footiiills. 
Because  most  of  this  area  is  within  subdivisions  of  the 
Citv  of  San  Fernando,  it  proved  to  be  one  of  the  more 
difficult  places  in  \\  hicii  to  olitain  useful  magnetic  data. 
l'"or  example,  near  cit\  streets  the  readings  were  affected 
by  numerous  buried  utility  lines  and  in  Facoima  Wasii, 
south  of  Lopez  dam,  the  data  \\  ere  unreliable  because 
of  the  presence  of  fences  and  a  reinforced  concrete 
ditch  lining  near  the  location  of  the  fault  break.  The 
only  data  utilized  in  this  area  were  obtained  in  the  few 
fields  and  open  spaces  that  could  be  found. 

Although  surface  breaks  related  to  the  recent 
earthquake  are  not  continuous  between  the  Mission 
XA'clls  and  Sylmar  segments  of  the  fault,  these  two  seg- 
ments ma\'  represent  one  favdt  zone,  continuous  at 
depth,  which  is  also  a  ground  water  barrier  in  this 
area  (\\'ent\\orth  and  Ycrkes,  1971,  p.  1.^),  (Califor- 
nia State  Water  Rights  Board,  1962,  v.  2,  figure  A-1). 
Drill  hole  data  suggest  that  the  alluvium  in  the  area 
generally  between  the  two  fault  segments  is  thicker 
than  that  in  the  \icinity  of  the  surface  breaks,  and  this 
ma\'  represent  a  buried  drainage  system,  called  the 
Sylmar  "notch",  where  it  crosses  the  ground  water 
barrier  (California  State  Water  Rights  Board,  1962, 
V.  2,  p.  15).  Two  magnetometer  lines  (E-E'  and  F-F', 
plate  3)  were  run  in  an  open  field  just  northeast  of 
San  Fernando  Road  beyond  the  easternmost  end  of 
the  ground  breakage  associated  with  the  Mission  ^Vells 
segment  of  the  fault;  one  short  line  (D-D',  plate  3) 
was  located  in  small  fields  northeast  of  Herrick  Ave- 
nue near  the  intersection  with  Hubbard  Street,  and 
another  line  (N-N')  was  located  parallel  to  and  just 
southwest  of  Glen  Oaks  Boulevard  near  the  intersec- 
tion with  Hubbard  Street.  Profiles  F.-E'  and  F-F' 
( figure  4)  show  relatively  small  but  distinct  magnetic 
anomalies,  or  gradients,  which  appear  as  steps,  60  to 
SO  gammas  in  amplitude,  close  to  the  projected  ex- 
tension of  the  Mission  Wells  surface  ruptures.  Line 
F-F'  may  contain  more  than  one  step.  Similarly  lines 
D-D'  and  N-N'  (figure  4)  show  distinct  magnetic 
anomalies  each  with  amplitudes  of  more  than  100 
gammas.  The  steep  gradient  in  each  case  is  near  a  line 
projected  between  the  Mission  Wells  and  S\'lmar  fault 
segments.  In  these  examples,  howc\'cr,  the  anomalies 
are  reversed;  that  is,  the  level  of  the  magnetic  field 
is  higher  on  the  north,  presumably  upthrown,  side  of 
the  projected  fault.  The  reason  the  usual  magnetic 
anomal\'  relationship  is  not  observed  on  these  lines  is 
unknow  n;  however,  a  possible  cause  may  be  found  in 
the  local  geologic  setting.  The  Pleistocene  Saugus 
Formation  north  of  the  fault  zone  in  this  area  is  over- 
lain b\-  only  a  shallow  cover  of  alluvium,  but  south 
of  the  fault  Tertiary  sedimentary  rocks  are  overlain 
by  a  much  thicker  layer  of  alluvium  (California  State 
VVatcr  Rights  Board,  1962,  v.  2,  p.  15).  It  may  be  that 
the  gravels  which  characterize  the  Saugus  Formation 


are  more  magnetic  in  the  area  north  of  the  fault  than 
is  the  alluvium  south  of  the  fault,  especially  if  the 
alluvium  in  this  part  of  the  valle\-  contains  less  mag- 
netite than  is  found  closer  to  the  mountain  fronts. 
Measurements  of  the  magnetic  susceptibilit&gt;'  of  sam- 
ples of  these  sedimentary  units  might  resolve  this 
problem.  Whatever  the  true  cause  of  these  anomalies, 
liowever,  the  results  tend  to  confirm  the  possible  con- 
tinuit\-  of  the  fault  between  the  Mission  AVells  and 
Sylmar  surface  breaks. 

Olive  View-Juvenile  Holl  Area 

A  number  of  magnetometer  lines  were  located 
both  east  and  west  of  the  Olive  \'iew  Hospital  and 
near  Ju\enile  I  lall  in  an  attempt  to  identif\-  possible 
faults  in  this  area  near  the  mountain  front.  These  lines 
show  no  major  anomalies  near  Olive  \'iew  Hospital  or 
Juvenile  Hall  which  might  suggest  important  faults, 
even  though  earthtiuake  damage  in  these  locations  was 
severe.  However,  two  nearl\-  parallel  lines  G-C  and 
H-H',  west  of  the  Olive  \'^iew  Hospital,  do  show  an 
anomal)'  of  possible  significance  (plate  3  and  figure  5). 
These  lines  extend  generalh'  southward  from  near  the 
alluvium-Pacoima  Formation  contact  at  the  base  of  the 
San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Most  of  the  magnetometer 
stations  were  located  in  olive  groves  and  were  rel- 
ativel\'  free  from  spurious  magnetic  effects,  but  some 
w  ere  affected  b\-  ufilit\-  lines  and  highwa\s.  In  order 
to  eliminate  the  most  ob\ious  irregularities,  a 
"smoothed"  version  of  each  profile  (dotted  line)  is 
also  show  n  in  figure  5. 

South  of  Foothill  Boulevard,  both  lines  show  very 
distinct  anomalies,  each  consisting  of  a  positive-neg- 
ative pair  with  a  peak-to-pcak  amplitude  of  from  150 
to  200  gammas.  The  positive  anomalies  are  on  the  south 
side  on  both  profiles. 

The  causes  of  these  observed  anomalies  are  not 
known,  but  the  characteristics  of  the  anomalies  indi- 
cate a  source  no  deeper  than  a  few  hundred  feet. 
Therefore,  they  do  not  originate  in  the  basement  rocks, 
which  arc  believed  to  be  at  a  depth  of  several  thou- 
sand feet  in  this  area  (California  State  Water  Rights 
Board,  1962,  v.  1,  plates  5  and  5B).  Offset  of  alluvium, 
or  of  some  other  relati\el\-  magnetic  rock  along  a 
fault  zone,  is  a  possible  cause  for  these  anomalies;  a 
dipping  magnetic  la\cr  or  bed  is  another. 

Magnetometer  lines  southwest  of  G-G'  and  H-H' 
show  some  indication  that  the  trend  of  this  anomaly 
ma\'  continue  soutliw  estward,  perhaps  at  least  as  far 
as  San  l''crnando  Roail  near  the  junction  with  Olden 
Street.  On  the  other  hand,  a  northeast  continuation  has 
not  been  itlentificd  with  ccrtaint\'  from  limited  work 
ilonc  betw  ecu  lines  G  and  1 1  and  the  Oli\c  \'iew  Hos- 
pital. 

.Assuming  that  the  anomalies  are  caused  b&gt;'  a  fault, 
the  approximate  location  of  this  possible  fault  is  shown 
on  the  profiles  (figure  5)  and  on  plate  3.  It  ma\'  be 
significant  that  this  location  is  somewhat  south  of,  but 
nearly  parallel  to,  that  given  for  the  Olive  \'iew  fault 
proposed  by  Merifield  (195S)  and  also  shown  on  the 
Los  Angeles  sheet  of  the  Geologic  Map  of  California 
(Jennings  and  Straiul,  1969).  Additional  geophysical 
ilata  and  possibl)-  subsurface  data  will  be  needed  to 
identify  more  clearK-  the  source  of  this  anomaly.

DISCUSSION  AND  CONCLUSIONS 

The  magnetometer  observations  in  the  San  Fer- 
nando Valley  area  discussed  above  show  that  distinct 
magnetic  anomalies  are  associated  with  traces  of  some 
of  the  known  active  faults  where  the  faults  cross 
alluvium  or  other  magnetite -bearing  rocks.  These  mag- 
netic anomalies  are  apparently  most  often  caused  by 
the  abrupt  thickening  of  the  alluvium  on  the  down- 
thrown  side  of  the  fault.  In  effect,  the  anomalies  rep- 
resent fault  scarps  which  have  been  preserved  by  burial 
in  the  alluvium. 

The  theoretical  anomaly  to  be  expected  on  a  line 
crossing  a  faulted  magnetic  bed  can  be  calculated  by 
means  of  the  expressions  given  by  Heiland  (1946,  p. 
395,  397).  For  example,  curve  A,  figure  6,  shows  the 
vertical  intensity  anomaly  calculated  for  a  vertically 
faulted  bed  about  35  feet  thick,  buried  at  a  depth  of 
15  feet,  assuming  an  effective  magnetic  susceptibility 
of  0.0025  emu.  This  example  approximates  the  dis- 
placement indicated  by  seismic  work  in  Little  Tujunga 
Canyon.  The  strike  of  the  edge  of  the  bed  is  assumed 
to  be  approximately  magnetic  east.  Because  the  active 
faults  we  are  concerned  with  in  the  San  Fernando 
Valley  are  probably  reverse  or  thrust  faults,  curve  B, 
figure  6,  is  given  to  show  a  comparison  with  the  case 
of  a  fault  surface  dipping  at  an  angle  of  45°  to  the 
north.  As  shown  in  figure  6,  the  theoretical  curve  for 
the  reverse  or  thrust  fault  has  a  less  steep  magnetic 
gradient  over  the  fault  and  a  less  pronounced  mag- 
netic minimum.  In  actual  examples,  however,  this  dis- 
tinction may  be  difficult  to  recognize.  The  magnetic 
susceptibility  used  for  the  theoretical  profiles,  0.0025 
emu,  was  chosen  to  produce  an  anomaly  approxi- 
mately the  same  size  as  those  actually  observed,  but 
no  magnetic  susceptibility  measurements  have  been 
made  on  samples.  This  value  is  somewhat  high  even 
considering  the  types  of  igneous  rocks  present  in  the 
alluvium,  so  it  may  be  that  the  actual  fault  displace- 
ment in  this  example  should  be  greater  and  the  mag- 


netic susceptibility  correspondingly  less. 

Some  of  the  observed  magnetic  profiles  in  the 
San  Fernando  area  show  a  distinct  resemblance  in 
shape  to  the  theoretical  profiles  in  figure  6  (see  figures 
2  and  3);  however,  in  other  examples  the  anomalies 
are  distorted,  partly  because  of  "noise,"  and  topo- 
graphic effects,  and  variations  in  thickness  and  mag- 
netic susceptibility  of  the  alluvium.  Therefore,  the 
most  easily  recognized  feature  of  these  fault-line 
anomalies  in  most  cases  is  probably  the  steep  magnetic 
gradient  which  should  be  located  close  to  the  fault 
zone. 

If  the  alluvium  were  fairly  uniform  in  magnetic 
characteristics,  it  might  be  possible  to  estimate  the 
relative  displacement  of  a  buried  fault  by  the  ampli- 
tude of  the  magnetic  anomaly.  However,  as  mentioned 
above  in  comparison  of  results  at  Little  Tujunga  Can- 
yon and  Lakeview  Terrace  Sanitarium,  the  size  of  the 
anomaly  did  not  correlate  with  displacement  as  shown 
by  seismic  measurements.  It  is  likely  that  the  magnetite 
content  of  the  alluvium,  hence  magnetic  susceptibility, 
varies  widely  throughout  the  area. 

Although  it  was  found  difficult  to  estimate  fault 
displacement  from  the  amplitude  of  a  magnetic  anom- 
aly, the  observed  anomalies  do  indicate  that  the  cumu- 
lative displacement  on  many  of  the  faults  is  consider- 
ably greater  than  that  resulting  from  the  most  recent 
episode  of  fault  movement.  Furthermore,  in  some 
places  the  observed  anomalies  suggest  extensions  of 
fault  zones  that  apparently  did  not  cause  surface  rup- 
tures in  the  recent  earthquakes. 

The  use  of  surface  magnetic  measurements  is 
limited  in  much  of  the  San  Fernando  Valley  area  by 
the  presence  of  man-made  structures  and  materials; 
however,  data  analysis  techniques  and  possibly  con- 
tinuous-recording mobile  ground  or  low-level  airborne 
magnetometers  might  be  useful  in  eliminating  some  of 
the  undesirable  magnetic  effects  in  future  work. 


SUPPLEMENT 


Additional  geophysical  data  were  obtained  in  the 
San  Fernando  area  in  order  to  provide  more  information 
on  some  of  the  fault  zones  discussed  in  the  first  part  of  this

MAGNETIC  DATA 
Tujunga  Canyon-Lakeview  Area 

Nevv  magnetic  profiles  were  obtained  both  east  and 
west  of  lines  Ci-Ci'  and  C4-C4'  (plate  3  and  figure  2)  along 
the  surface  breaks  associated  with  the  Lakeview  segment 
of  the  fault.  As  indicated  in  the  first  part  of  this  report,  the 
magnetic  anomaly  that  is  associated  with  the  fault  in  this 
area  apparently  diverges  southward  from  the  surface  rup- 
ture of  the  fault  east  of  line  C4-C4'.  As  can  be  seen  on  plate 
3,  this  anomaly  trend  may  represent  an  extension  of  a  branch 
of  the  Lakeview  segment  of  the  fault  that  did  not  cause  a 


surface  rupture  during  the  recent  earthquake.  East  of  line 
Ci-Ci',  however,  the  magnetic  gradient  characteristically 
associated  with  the  fault  is  less  steep  and  covers  a  wider 
area,  as  indicated  on  line  Cs-Cs'  (plate  3  and  figure  7). 
This  relatively  broad  gradient  may  represent  the  combined 
effects  of  more  than  one  fault  in  this  part  of  the  area.  Fur- 
ther east,  as  shown  by  line  C7-C7'  (plate  3  and  figure  7), 
the  usual  steep  magnetic  gradient  is  once  again  present — 
now  directly  over  the  surface  rupture  of  the  Lakeview  seg- 
ment near  the  north  end  of  the  profile. 

Line  Cn-Cis^  located  about  a  quarter  of  a  mile  east 
of  the  Lakeview  Terrace  Sanitarium  (plate  3  and  figure  8), 
crosses  the  surface  breaks  of  the  southern  branch  of  the 
Lakeview  segment  of  the  fault  in  Big  Tujunga  Wash.  This 
profile  is  also  marked  by  a  distinct  magnetic  anomaly  over 
the  fault  zone,  which  suggests  a  pronounced  subsurface 
displacement.  Westward  from  line  C13-C13',  the  mapped 
surface  breaks  on  the  branch  of  the  fault  in  Big  Tujunga

Wash  end  east  of  the  Lakeview  Terrace  Sanitarium  (plate 
3).  For  more  than  a  mile  and  a  half  in  this  direction — 
between  the  sanitarium  and  the  apparent  end  of  the  Tujunga 
fault  segment  east  of  Little  Tujunga  Canyon — there  are  no 
mapped  surface  breaks  along  the  northern  edge  of  the 
Wash.  Although  no  magnetometer  data  are  available  in  the 
area,  the  large  magnetic  anomalies  at  Little  Tujunga  Canyon 
on  the  west  and  the  sanitarium  on  the  east  suggest  a  possi- 
ble continuous  fault  segment  between  these  two  areas. 

Figure  9  is  a  comparison  of  the  magnetic  anomaly 
actually  observed  on  line  C4-C4'  in  Big  Tujunga  Wash  with 
a  theoretical  anomaly  calculated  by  means  of  the  expression 
given  by  Heiland  (1946,  p.  397)  for  a  magnetic  slope. 

The  slope  of  the  fault  surface  is  assumed  to  be  45°  north. 
The  alluvium  was  assumed  to  be  approximately  150  feet 
thick  south  of  the  fault  and  about  15  feet  thick  north  of 
the  fault  on  the  basis  of  a  drill  hole  in  Oliver  Canyon, 
west  of  this  area,  that  showed  terrace  deposits  displaced 
at  least  this  much  (Proctor  and  others,  1972,  p.  1611).  The 
theoretical  anomaly  also  assumes  a  contrast  in  magnetic 
susceptibility  of  0.002  emu/cm^  between  the  alluvium  and 
the  underlying  rocks.  Except  for  the  north  end  of  the  pro- 
file in  this  example,  the  theoretical  anomaly  approximates 
the  observed  anomaly  reasonably  well.  Although  no  at- 
tempt has  been  made  to  measure  the  magnetite  content  of 
the  alluvium  in  this  area,  the  calculated  magnetic  suscepti- 
bility would  probably  correspond  to  a  difference  in  the 
average  magnetite  content  of  roughly  1  to  2  percent. 

The  Veterans  Fault 

Additional  magnetometer  lines  were  added  south  and 
east  of  the  Veterans  Administration  Hospital  in  order  to 
examine  in  more  detail  the  anomaly  in  this  &amp;rz&amp;i  which  was 


discussed  on  page 21  5.  Line  Rs-Rs'  (plate  3  and  figure  10) 
crosses  this  anomaly  in  an  open  field  below  the  hill  east 
of  the  Veterans  Administration  FHospital.  The  hill  in  the 
northern  part  of  this  area  may  cause  some  distortion  of  the 
magnetic  field;  however,  the  amplitude  of  the  anomaly  is 
more  than  400  gammas  on  this  line.  Thus,  if  this  anomaly  is 
caused  by  a  fault,  it  is  one  of  the  larger  such  anomalies 
found  thus  far  in  the  San  Fernando  area. 

The  anomaly  south  of  the  Veterans  Administration 
hlospital  was  traced  westward  part  way  across  the  open 
field  (line  R4-R4',  plate  3  and  figure  10),  where  the  anomaly 
either  bends  toward  the  southwest  or  is  offset  in  this 
direction.  If  it  does  continue  in  this  direction,  it  enters  a 
city  subdivision,  where  it  was  not  possible  to  continue 
detailed  magnetic  work. 

SE\SmQ  AND  GRAVITY  DATA 

To  determine  the  possible  usefulness  of  other  geo- 
physical methods  for  tracing  the  "active"  fault  zones  in 
the  San  Fernando  area,  a  few  detailed  seismic  refraction 
and  gravity  profiles  were  made  in  parts  of  the  area.  For 
the  seismic  profiles,  a  12-channel  Midwestern  portable 
seismic  refraction  unit  was  used.  Energy  was  supplied  by 
a  300-pound  weight  that  was  dropped  along  a  track  to 
strike  a  steel  plate  on  the  ground.  The  geophone  cables 
used  were  220  and  550  feet  long  with  a  corresponding 
geophone  spacing  of  20  and  50  feet.  Shot  points  were 
taken  at  each  end  and  at  the  center  of  each  geophone 
cable  and,  in  some  cases,  at  offset  locations  beyond  the 
end  of  the  cable.  The  gravity  data  were  obtained  by 
means  of  a  Worden  gravimeter  with  a  scale  constant  of 
approximately  0.10  milligals  per  scale  division.

figure  1)  yielded  data  that  was  very  similar  to  that  reported 
by  Proctor  (1972,  p.  1616).  North  of  the  surface  break, 
the  interface  between  layers  having  velocities  of  approx- 
imately 1000  and  8000  feet  per  second  was  found  at  a 
depth  of  about  8  feet.  South  of  the  surface  break,  layers 
characterized  by  velocities  of  approximately  1500,  3300, 
and  8000  feet  per  second  were  found  at  depths  of  5,  21, 
and  51  feet,  respectively.  Thus,  the  high  velocity  layer  is 
apparently  offset  vertically  over  40  feet  along  the  fault 
in  this  area. 

Figure  11  shows  line  R7-R7',  a  seismic  and  magnetic 
profile,  located  south  of  the  Veterans  Administration  Hos- 
pital dred  and  just  west  of  the  southern  part  of  line  Rs-Rs' 
(plate  3).  The  seismic  profile  is  550  feet  long  and  crosses 
the  location  of  the  possible  fault  shown  on  line  R?  and 
plate  3.  This  profile  fails  to  show  evidence  of  significant 
fault  displacement  of  the  deepest  layer  detected  (approx- 
imately 4000  feet  per  second).  It  does  show  a  layer  with 
an  intermediate  velocity  (2500  feet  per  second)  present 
on  the  south  end  of  the  seismic  profile  that  apparently 
pinches  out  near  a  possible  fault.  If  such  a  fault  is  present, 
as  suggested  by  the  magnetic  data,  it  might  not  have  been 
detected  because  of  the  limited  depth  of  penetration  of 
the  seismic  energy.  Alternatively,  the  magnetic  anomaly 
may  have  a  cause  other  than  faulting,  perhaps  a  contact 
between  two  rock  units  such  as  older  alluvial  fan  deposits 
and  the  Saugus  Formation  that  may  have  similar  seismic  ve- 
locities but  different  magnetic  susceptibilities. 

Figure  12  is  a  gravity  profile  on  line  B-B',  which 
crosses  the  Tujunga  segment  of  the  San  Fernando  fault  in 
Little  Tujunga  Canyon.  This  corresponds  to  a  part  of  mag- 
netic profile  B-B'  (figure  1).  The  gravity  data  are  Bouguer 
anomalies  calculated  for  an  assumed  density  of  2.67  g/cm'. 
Although  the  gravity  profile  is  characterized  by  a  relatively 
steep  gradient  downward  to  the  north,  which  is  believed 
to  represent  an  anomaly  on  a  regional  scale,  there  is  no 
evidence  of  a  local  anomaly  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Tujunga 
segment  of  the  fault.  Other  gravity  profiles  in  this  area  also 
failed  to  show  any  features  that  could  be  interpreted  as 
fault-related  anomalies.  It  is  likely  that  the  explanation  for 
the  lack  of  gravity  anomalies  over  these  fault  zones  is  the 
relatively  small  difference  in  density  between  alluvium  and 
the  older  Quaternary  and  Tertiary  rock  units  offset  by  the 
fault.

CHAPTER      18 

Afterslip  on  the  Sylmar  Fault  Segmenf 

by  A.  G.  Sylvester  ^  and  D.  D.  Pollard  ^ 


ABSTRACT 

A  series  of  first-order  precision  levelings  of  two  200  m 
long  lines  shows  that  more  than  6  mm  of  vertical  afterslip 
occurred  in  the  period  from  4  to  330  days  following  the 
main  shock  of  the  1971  San  Fernando  earthquake.  This  is 
only  about  1  percent  of  the  total  vertical  component  of 
slip  measured  at  the  site  shortly  after  the  earthquake,  and 
it  is  negligible  compared  with  afterslip  documented  for 
other  recent  California  earthquakes  at  Parkfield  in  1966 
and  at  Borrego  Mountain  in  1968. 

These  data  suggest  that  the  available  stored  elastic 
strain  energy  may  have  been  completely  released  through- 
out the  rupture  volume  during  the  main  earthquake  and 
main  aftershocks,  so  that  there  was  little  or  no  residual 
strain  to  be  relieved  by  afterslip.  Experimental  studies  of 
rock  deformation  suggest  that  this  mechanism  of  strain 
release  is  probably  typical  of  crustal  blocks  capable  of 
supporting  high  normal  stresses  and  separated  by  "com- 
pressionol"  types  of  faults  like  the  thrust  fault  responsible 
for  the  1971  San  Fernando  earthquake. 


Detailed  geodetic  studies  following  some  recent  Cali- 
fornia earthquakes  have  shown  that  displacement  may 
continue  at  the  fault  trace  for  many  months  after  the 
main  shock  (Wallace  and  Roth,  1967;  Smith  and 
Wyss,  1968;  Scholz  and  others,  1969;  Burford,  in 
press).  Typically,  the  rate  of  the  displacements  de- 
creases logarithmically  with  time,  corresponding  to  a 
similar  decrease  in  the  frequency  of  aftershocks.  Nason 
(1969)  termed  this  phenomenon  "afterslip"  and  noted 
that  the  number  of  documented  cases  is  small.  The 
displacements  following  the  1966  Parkfield  earthquake 
were  episodic  with  no  obvious  direct  relationship  be- 
tween local  seismic  activity  and  afterslip  (Smith  and 
Wyss,  1968;  Scholz  and  others,  1969);  however,  it  is 
not  clear  if  this  is  typical  and  can  be  expected  for  all 
earthquakes. 

The  location,  rate,  and  duration  of  the  displacements 
may  provide  important  information  for  understanding 
the  mechanisms  of  earthquakes  and  aftershocks  (Nason, 
1971);  but  the  information  is  likely  to  be  of  equal 
importance  to  engineers  involved  in  reconstruction  of 
pipelines,  streets,  bridges,  and  buildings  across  the 
traces  of  surface  ruptures  in  residential  and  commer- 
cial areas. 

The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine  if  after- 
slip  occurred  on  part  of  one  of  the  main  surface  rup-

tures  in  Sylmar  and,  if  so,  to  attempt  to  determine  its 
rate  and  relationship  to  aftershocks. 

PROCEDURE 

An  X-shaped  figure  was  established  and  surveyed 
on  13  February  1971  (PST)  across  the  central  part  of 
the  Sylmar  fault  segment  (U.  S.  Geological  Survey, 
1971)  where  the  zone  of  surface  rupturing  is  relatively 
narrow  and  well  defined  (figure  1).  Initial  horizontal 
and  vertical  components  of  slip  were  determined  from 
displaced  sidewalks  and  curbs  and  amounted  to  nearly 
2  m  and  %  m,  respectively  (Kamb  and  others,  1971; 
U.  S.  Geological  Survey,  1971).  Several  extension 
fractures  broke  Cometa  Avenue  between  our  Points  A 
and  IP  (figure  1).  Each  fracture  extended  into  private 
yards  on  each  side  of  the  street  for  unknown  distances 
and  exhibited  from  1  to  5  cm  of  vertical  displacement 
and  from  0  to  2  cm  of  right-lateral  displacement. 

Each  monument  is  an  8-cm  PK  nail  driven  into  the 
15-cm  thick  asphalt  street  until  the  base  of  the  head 
was  flush  with  the  surface  of  the  street.  Care  was 
taken  to  locate  the  points  in  parts  of  the  street  which 
we  guessed  (and  hoped)  would  survive  the  inevitable 
excavation  of  damaged  underground  utility  lines  and 
as  far  as  possible  from  fresh  cracks.  The  nearest  crack

to  any  of  the  points  was  a  hairline  extension  fracture 
4  m  southeast  of  A  (figure  1).  No  cracks  were  ob- 
served in  the  streets  beyond  the  projections  of  our 
lines.  Point  D  (figure  1)  was  finally  obliterated  by 
street  repair  crews  prior  to  the  resurvey  of  August  20, 
but  its  probable  elevation  in  subsequent  resurveys  has 
been  calculated  from  elevations  of  surrounding  auxili- 
ary monuments.  A  trench,  1  m  deep,  was  dug  within 
half  a  meter  of  IP  sometime  around  March  1  and 
filled  shortly  thereafter.  The  elevation  of  IP  changed 
anomalously  with  respect  to  the  endpoints,  but  the 
change  also  occurred  before  the  excavation  and  thus 
is  probably  not  attributed  to  settling  of  the  ground 
around  the  trench,  as  is  discussed  in  the  next  section. 
Angles  were  turned  to  each  endpoint  with  a  shaded 
Wild  T-2  theodolite  at  IP.  Street  repair  crews  and 
heavy  sightseeing  traffic  during  the  first  two  weeks 
precluded  safe  and  accurate  taping  of  distances,  so 
distances  from  IP  to  the  endpoints  were  measured 
with  the  T-2  and  a  Wild  subtense  bar.  The  mean 
precision  of  the  angles  for  all  surveys  is  ±1  second, 
but  the  error  associated  with  the  distances  is  ±  2  cm 
which  exceeds  horizontal  component  of  afterslip  we 
would  expect  from  our  leveling  data  by  an  order  of 
magnitude. 

Each  leg  of  the  X-figure  was  leveled  independently, 
the  only  point  in  common  being  IP.  All  leveling  was 
double-run  with  balanced  sights  of  approximately  25  m 
using  a  shaded  Wild  N-3  tilting  level  with  two  Wild 
invar  leveling  rods.  The  leveling  was  usually  done  in 
the  morning  or  late  afternoon  when  heat  refraction 
eff^ects  were  slight  or  not  present.  Closing  errors  of 
each  leg  of  each  survey  were  less  than  0.3  mm.  The 
estimated  average  error  for  any  given  point,  as  ob- 


tained by  comparison  of  our  repeated  levelings  on 
diff'erent  dates  in  stable  areas  elsewhere,  is  ±0.2  mm. 
The  initial  leveling  was  done  on  13  February,  four 
da&gt;'S  after  the  main  shock.  Observations  were  repeated 
on  20  and  22  February,  6  and  30  March,  13  May, 
20  August  1971,  and  4  January  1972.  iMonuments  W, 
X,  Y,  Z  (figure  1)  were  established  and  leveled  on 
March  6  to  get  a  better  idea  where  the  slip  was  taking 
place. 

RESULTS 
The  seven  relevelings  show  minor  cumulative  dif- 
ferences among  the  elevations  of  the  five  points.  The 
magnitude  and  consistency  of  the  displacements  are 
consistent  with  afterslip  measurements  across  surface 
ruptures  elsewhere  in  the  meisoseismal  area  (Burford 
and  others,  1971;  Lahr  and  others,  1971;  Nason,  1971; 
Savage  and  others,  1972).  The  elevation  differences  of 
each  set  of  repeat  measurements  are  compared  with 
the  initial  set  in  figures  2  and  3.  In  figure  2,  C  and  D 
are  arbitrarily  fixed  to  show  the  relative  elevation 
changes  of  A,  B,  and  IP  across  the  fault.  In  figure  3, 
the  common  point  of  the  two  lines,  IP,  is  arbitrarily 
fixed  to  show  the  relative  elevation  changes  of  end- 
points  of  the  lines.  It  is  clear  that  A  and  B  have  risen 
consistently  relative  to  C  and  D  and  that  IP  has 
dropped  relative  to  the  four  endpoints. 

The  cumulative  displacements  of  A  and  B  relative 
to  C  and  D  are  plotted  in  figures  4  and  5  which  show 
that  nearly  half  of  the  displacement  occurred  within 
10  days  of  the  first  leveling.  The  rate  decreased  loga- 
rithmically to  about  1  mm  per  100  days  after  May  13. 
This  corresponds  to  the  general  decline  in  the  fre- 
quency of  the  aftershocks  (Espinosa  and  others,  1971).

Figure  5.  Cumulative  vertical  displacement  vs.  log  time  of  point  B  with  respect  to  point  D.  The  elevation 
differences  for  the  surveys  of  20  August  and  4  January  (open  circles)  ore  approximate,  because  the  eleva  - 
tion  of  D    had  to  be  calculated  from  elevations  of  surrounding  auxiliary  monuments. 


The  magnitude  of  the  displacements,  however,  is  small 
compared  to  the  initial  vertical  component  of  slip  of 
75  cm  at  this  locality  determined  bv  Kamb  and  others 
(1971)  and  by  the  U.S.G.S.  (1971)'.  Indeed,  the  rather 
even  and  minor  displacements  we  measured  may  be 
attributed  merely  to  gradual  dehydration  of  the 
ground  from  winter  to  summer.  However,  inasmuch 
as  the  greatest  elevation  change  occurred  within  a  few 
days  of,  and  is  consistent  in  direction  with  the  main 
initial  displacement  (north  block  up  relative  to  the 
south  block,  figure  1),  we  consider  the  data  show 
evidence  of  real,  but  minor,  afterslip  on  this  portion 
of  the  fault. 

The  anomalous,  but  consistent,  drop  of  IP  relative 
to  the  endpoints  may  be  due  to  one  of  the  following 
mechanisms: 

1.  compaction  of  the  ground  which  wos  dilated  by  fracturing  near 
the  fault  scarp; 

2.  southward  tilting  of  the  south  edge  of  the  north  block  about 
an   oxis  parallel   to,  and   north   of,  the  fault  scarp;   and 

3.  slight  near-surface  lateral-spreading  of  the  ground  and/or  of 
a  major  slab  of  the  asphalt  street  downhill  (south)  toward  the 
free  face  of  the  scarp. 

Longer  level  lines  and  more  data  points  would  be 
required  to  make  a  clear  choice  among  the  possibilities; 
however,  the  third  mechanism  is  supported  by  the 
triangulation  data  which  show  that  the  angle  C-IP-D 
consistently  increased  by  an  amount  about  equal  to 
the  sum  of  the  changes  of  the  other  three  angles,  all 


of  which  decreased.  Angle  A-IP-B  should  not  have 
changed  unless  movement  occurred  on  a  minor  frac- 
ture north  of  IP.  We  cannot  rule  out  this  possibility, 
but  further  speculation  about  the  behavior  of  a  single 
data  point  does  not  seem  warranted. 

DISCUSSION 

This  study  and  others  (Lahr  and  others,  1971; 
Nason,  1971;  Burford  and  others,  1971:  Savage  and 
others,  1972)  show  that  afterslip  accounts  for  less  than 
2  percent  of  the  total  slip  from  ly^  to  330  days  fol- 
lowing the  main  shock  of  the  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake. This  is  of  particular  interest  in  view  of  the 
relatively  large  contribution  of  afterslip  to  the  total 
slip  in  the  recent  California  earthquakes  of  comparable 
magnitudes  at  Parkfield  and  Borrego.  The  evidence 
from  both  earthquakes  suggested  that  afterslip  may  be 
the  result  of  the  delay  in  propagation  of  slip  from 
relatively  rigid  basement  rocks  through  the  overlying 
relative  nonrigid  sedimentary  rocks  (Smith  and  Wyss, 
1968;  Scholz  and  others,  1969;  Burford,  in  press). 

Approximately  3-4  km  of  sedimentary  rock's  overlie 
the  crystalline  basement  in  the  Sylmar  area,  based  on 
a  gravity-density  model  of  the  San  Fernando  \''alley 
(Corbato,  1963).  The  upper  part  of  the  sedimentary 
sequence  is  composed  of  as  much  as  1,800  m  of  par- 
tially indurated  sand  and  gravel  of  the  Plio-Pleistocene 
Saugus  Formation  which  closel)'  resembles  the  rela- 
tively thin  veneer  of  overlying  unconsolidated  alluvium

(Wentworth  and  Yerkes,  1971).  Thus  the  sedimen- 
tary blanket  is  apparently  comparable  in  thickness  and 
lithologic  character  to  those  at  Parkfield  and  Borrego 
Mountain;  but  the  absence  of  significant  afterslip  at 
Sylmar  does  not  support  the  slip  propagation  delay 
mechanism  outlined  above,  unless  basement  is  much 
shallower  beneath  the  surface  ruptures  than  Corbato's 
model  suggests. 

The  afterslip  phenomenon  may  be  related  in  a  more 
fundamental  way  to  the  mechanism  and  relative  effi- 
ciency of  release  of  stored  elastic  strain  throughout 
the  entire  rupture  volume  rather  than  just  within  the 
near  surface  portion  of  it  (Nason,  1969).  Experimen- 
tal studies  of  rock  deformation  (Byerlee  and  Brace, 
1968)  have  shown  that  rock  failure  at  low  pressure 
occurs  in  most  rock  types  by  abrupt  faulting  with 
low  stress  drops  followed  by  stable  sliding  which  is 
analogous  to  afterslip.  At  high  pressures  and  low  tem- 
perature, however,  faulting  occurs  only  by  sudden, 
violent  stick  slip  with  relatively  large  stress  drops; 
no  movement  follows  the  initial  faulting  because  the 
stored  elastic  strain  energy  is  almost  completely  re- 
leased in  the  single  "main  shock." 

Extension  of  these  experimental  results  to  earth- 
quakes suggests  that,  when  the  stress  reaches  a  critical 
value  for  slip  on  a  segment  of  a  fault  between  two 
strongly  compressed  crustal  blocks,  violent  and  sudden 
faulting  will  take  place  along  the  entire  segment  (By- 
erlee and  Brace,  1968).  Thus,  available  stored  elastic 
strain  would  be  released  abruptly  and  almost  com- 
pletely throughout  the  entire  rupture  volume,  and 
further  movement,  including  afterslip,  ^\■ould  be  pre- 
cluded until  the  slow  process  of  stress  build-up  and 
strain  accumulation  again  reach  the  critical  value  for 
violent  and  sudden  release.  The  hypothesis  suggests  that 
this  process  should  be  expected  with  earthquakes  on 


"compressional"  type  faults  which  concentrate  rela- 
tively high  stresses.  In  California,  these  would  include 
bent  sections  of  major  strike-slip  faults  (Wyss  and 
Brune,  1971)  as  well  as  high-angle  reverse  faults  and 
thrust  faults  like  the  complex  Sierra  Madre  fault  system 
along  part  of  which  the  1971  San  Fernando  earthquake 
occurred. 

Clearly,  many  more  detailed  geodetic  studies  are 
needed  along  all  of  California's  major  faults,  not  only 
to  document  the  mechanism  of  strain  release  after 
earthquakes,  but  also  to  document  the  mechanism  of 
strain  accumulation  before  earthquakes. 

AS  WE  GO  TO  PRESS 

Short  segments  of  first-order  lines,  leveled  initially 
by  other  surveyors  shortly  after  the  earthquake,  were 
releveled  early  in  1972  to  determine  the  variation  in 
afterslip  along  the  length  of  the  Sylmar  fault  segment. 
The  results  are  summarized  in  figure  6  which  shows 
that  afterslip  is  small  or  absent  on  the  east  end  of 
the  Sylmar  segment  where  the  maximum  uplift  oc- 
curred and  is  larger,  though  still  negligible,  on  the 
M'estern  end  of  the  Sylmar  segment  and  on  the  Mission 
Wells  segment  where  initial  uplift  was  less  than  0.5  m. 
The  elevation  changes  occur  where  the  level  lines 
cross  the  principal  displacement  zone  and  are  not 
functions  of  the  length  of  the  repeated  line  as  is  sug- 
gested by  the  figure.  The  elevation  changes  are  nor- 
malized to  a  rate  in  millimeters  per  year  merely  to 
show  the  variation  along  the  fault  with  respect  to 
the  interval  of  lapsed  time. 

Observed  elevation  data  for  initial  levelings  were 
generously  provided  to  us  by  VTN  Engineers  of 
Van  Nuys  and  by  the  Survey  Division  under  the

Angeles.

CHAPTER  19 

Effects  of  the 

Earthquake  on 

Residential  Areas^ 

by  James  E.  Slosson  ' 


The  violent  earthquake  that  shook  the  general  Los 
Angeles  area  on  February  9,  1971,  brought  havoc  and 
devastation  to  the  northern  portion  of  the  San  Fer- 
nando Valley  and  the  San  Fernando  Pass  area.  The  ex- 
tent of  damage  decreased  radially  away  from  the  cen- 
ter of  destruction.  Damage  was  noticeable  more  than 
30  miles  from  the  epicenter.  The  earthquake  had  a 
magnitude  of  6.S.  Its  epicenter  was  located  in  a  remote 
portion  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  approximately  3 
miles  south  of  the  Antelope  Valley  Freeway  (Inter- 
state 14).  Zones  of  surface  rupture  associated  with  fault- 
ing were  within  the  general  San  Fernando-Sylmar  area, 
approximately  9  miles  south  of  the  epicenter.  The 
zones  of  rupture  correspond  with  the  area  of  maximum 
energy  release.  The  fault  motion  or  displacement  was 
associated  with  a  relatively  steep,  high-angle  reverse 
fault  that  dips  steeply  from  the  surface  rupture  zone 
in  San  Fernando-Sylmar  to  a  depth  of  7  to  8  miles 
below  the  epicentral  area.  Thus  a  block  or  portion  of 
the  San  Gabriel  Alountains  was  thrust  upward  toward 
the  south,  or  toward  the  San  Fernando  Valley.  Asso- 
ciated with  the  main  thrust  motion  was  a  lateral  com- 
ponent (left-lateral  motion)  that  was  lesser  but  still 
significant. 

The  Februar\-  9  earthquake  occurred  at  approxi- 
matel}'  6:00  a.m.,  a  time  when  most  people  were  still 
at  home.  Considering  the  damage  to  the  freeway  sys- 
tem in  the  San  Fernando-Sylmar  area  and  to  the  public 
and  commercial  buildings  in  the  west-central  portion 
of  Los  Angeles  along  with  the  crowded  condition  that 
generally  prevails  on  the  streets  and  sidewalks  of  Los 
Angeles,  both  the  fatalities  and  injuries  would  have 
been  much  higher  if  the  earthquake  had  occurred  even 
an  hour  later. 

In  retrospect,  the  inhabitants  of  the  areas  most 
severely  damaged  were  lucky  that  the&gt;'  were  at  home 
when  the  temblor  struck.  The  typical  one-story,  sin- 
gle-family dwelling  \\ithstood  the  great  forces  of 
energy  released  by  the  earthquake  remarkably  well. 
Some  single-family  dwellings  were  damaged  and  some 
were  destroyed,  but  there  were  only  two  fatalities  as 
compared  to  56  fatalities  associated  with  other  types  of 
structures.  This  fact  is  even  more  remarkable  when  it 
is  considered  that  over  90  percent  of  the  people  within

the  area  of  the  earthquake  were  in  residential  structures 
at  6:00  a.m.  on  February  9. 

The  residential  areas  that  received  the  greatest 
amount  of  damage  were  the  city  of  San  Fernando, 
where  approximately  30  percent  of  the  residential 
structures  sustained  appreciable  damage,  and  the  city 
of  Los  Angeles,  where  severe  damage  occurred  in  the 
suburb  of  Sylmar.  Also  \\ithin  the  city  of  Los  Angeles, 
there  was  lesser,  but  still  important,  damage  in  the 
suburbs  of  Granada  Hills,  Sunland-Tujunga,  and  Pa- 
coima.  Regions  \\ithin  Los  Angeles  County  ^hich 
were  damaged  included  the  Kagel  Canyon-Little  Tu- 
junga  Canyon  area  and  the  Saugus-Ncwhall  area. 

Plate  3  illustrates  graphically  the  areas  of  major 
destruction  as  related  to  the  zones  of  faulting  and  other 
entities  of  the  geological  environment. 

PRINCIPAL  ZONE  OF  DAMAGE 
City  of  San  Fernando 

San  Fernando,  a  small  incorporated  area  in  Los 
Angeles  County,  incurred  the  highest  per  capita  per- 
centage of  damage  to  residential  structures.  San  Fer- 
nando is  2.4  square  miles  in  size  and  maintained  5210 
living  units  at  the  time  of  the  1970  census.  A  detailed 
study  performed  by  the  City  of  San  Fernando  after 
the  earthquake  listed  165  singlc-famil\'  dwellings  as 
demolished,  100  empty  residential  buildings  needing 
rehabilitation,  and  150  with  major  damage  (over  S7500 
per  unit).  Also  listed  \\ere  26  apartment  living  units 
demolished  and  75  damaged  and  in  need  of  major 
repair.  In  all,  approximately  1500  of  5210  units  sus- 
tained appreciable  damage.  Originall\',  270  units  were 
tagged  as  unsafe,  but  this  number  \\as  cvcntuall&gt;"  in- 
creased to  300.  The  statistics  cvcntuall\-  indicated  that 
an  estimated  30  percent  of  the  residential  units  were 
appreciably  damaged  with  the  total  for  these  losses 
calculated  at  $12,125,000.  It  is  further  estimated  that 
30  to  35  percent  of  all  of  structures  in  San  Fernando 
were  damaged. 

The  area  in  San  Fernando  that  Iiad  the  highest 
residential  damage  was  the  pre- 193 3  section  of  town. 
However,  the  most  concentrated  damage  occurred  in 
a  zone  where  extensive  ground  rupture  inferred  to  be 
associated  with  faulting  took  place. 

City  of  Los  Angeles 

Within  Los  Angeles,  the  heaviest  damage  occurred 
in  that  area  closest  to  the  zone  of  surface  expression  or 
surface  rupture  associated  with  the  earthquake.  This

diate vicinitN'  of,  the  surface  expression  of  the  fault 
motion.  The  unsafe  or  severely  damaged  apartments, 
however,  showed  a  different  statistical  and  geographi- 
cal pattern,  with  the  greatest  number  (greater  than  80 
percent)  being  located  within  the  general  downtown 
Los  Angeles  area  some  20  or  more  miles  from  the  area 
of  greatest  residential  damage. 

Figure  1  depicts  the  location  of  vacated  structures 
within  the  city  of  Los  Angeles.  It  clearly  shows  the 
greatest  damage  to  residential  structures  to  be  in  the 
Granada  Hills,  Sylmar,  and  Sunland-Tujunga  areas  and 
the  greatest  damage  to  apartment  buildings  to  be  in 
the  Central  Los  Angeles  area. 

The  higher  loss  in  apartment  buildings  for  Los 
Angeles  is  almost  directly  associated  \\-ith  time  of  con- 
struction. The  pre-1933  structures  had  a  much  higher 
loss  factor  than  the  modern  structures.

The  total  of  the  statistics  from  the  City  of  San 
Fernando,  City  of  Los  Angeles,  and  County  of  Los 
Angeles  indicates  that  approximately  19,771  single- 
family  dwellings  were  damaged  and  730  \\erc  demol- 
ished or  required  major  rehabilitation.  Ninety-rvvo 
apartment  buildings  w  ere  demolished  or  required  ma- 
jor rehabilitation,  and  2,077  apartment  buildings  were 
damaged.*  The  total  estimated  monctar\-  loss  associ- 
ated \\ith  these  affected  structures  is  %91  million,  of 
\\hich  S5S  million  loss  was  to  single-family  dwellings. 
Population  w  ithin  the  areas  of  strong  to  very  strong 
ground  shaking  (.20g  to  .50g)  under  the  jurisdiction 
of  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  exceeds  one  million;  out 
of  this  population,  there  was  one  recorded  fatality 
within  a  residential  structure.  Therefore,  the  casualt&gt;- 
factor  for  occupants  of  the  residential  structures  in  the 
northeast  part  of  Los  Angeles  \\  as  less  than  1  person 
per  1,000,000.  In  addition,  the  statistics  for  residential 
structures  within  the  entire  area  affected  by  strong 
to  very  strong  ground  shaking  indicate  that  there  were 
two  fatalities  (including  the  one  listed  for  the  City  of 
Los  Angeles)  in  a  region  with  a  population  of  approx- 
imately 2,500,000.  This  region  includes  the  affected 
City  of  Los  Angeles  and  tiic  unincorporated  portions 
of  Los  Angeles  Count_\-  such  as  Saugus-Ncw  hall  and 
the  foothills  bounding  San  Fernando  (population  less 
than  1,000,000).  Thus  the  casualty  factor  for  residen- 
tial structures  within  the  entire  area  affected  by  strong 
to  \erv  strong  ground  shaking  \\as  somewhat  less  than 
1  person  per  1 ,000,000. 

Considering  that  approximately  90  percent  of  the 
people  in  these  areas  were  in  their  residences  at  the 
time  of  the  earthquake,  the  casualt\-  factor  for  the 
February  9,  1971,  earthquake  Mas  phenomenally  low, 
averaging  approximately  one  in  one  million.** 

The  damage  factor  within  a  given  area  was  gener- 
all\-  high  for  older,  masonr&gt;'  t&gt;pes  of  residences.  The 
modern  homes,  with  some  exceptions,  performed  quite 
well.  Some  of  the  damage  was  associated  with  consoli- 
dation and  settlement  of  fills  in  tracts  for  single  lots 
developed  prior  to  1963  Mhen  the  modern  grading 
codes  were  introduced.  Many  of  the  severely  damaged 


*  Also  damased  in  Los  Angeles  County  were  1,707  mobile  homes 
for  which  no  monetary  loss  factor  has  been  determined.

strictly  enforced  in  Los  Angeles  than  in  other  cities  in  Cali-

structures  were  located  upon  fill  material  where  the 
sites  were  graded  prior  to  the  early  1950s  (no  grading 
regulations  prior  to  1952).  The  largest  number  of  ,se- 
riousi)-  damaged  or  dcstro\ed  liomes  \\ ere  located  on 
alluvial  deposits;  and,  in  turn,  tlie  greatest  damage  was 
associated  whh  the  le.ss  consolidated  alluvium. 

DAMAGE  RELATED  TO  THE 
GEOLOGIC  ENVIRONMENT 
Surface  Rupture  Associated  With  Faulting 

One  of  the  most  iiea\ily  damaged  zones  was  the 
area  within  San  Fernando  together  with  a  portion  of 
Sylmar  that  extends  from  near  the  intersection  of 
Foothill  Boulevard  and  Maclay  Avenue  to  and  through 
the  intersection  of  Clenoaks  Boulevard  and  Hubbard 
Street.  This  rupture  zone  extended  west  and  east 
through  less  populated  areas  where,  for  this  reason, 
less  destruction  occurred.  Within  this  zone,  Avhich 
averaged  a  few  hundred  feet  in  width,  almost  every 
structure,  both  housing  and  commercial,  was  cither 
damaged  or  destroyed.  See  photos  1,2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7. 

This  zone  of  surface  rupturing  appears  to  be 
closeK'  related  to  a  fault  zone  that  had  been  considered 
inactive  and  was  only  subtl\-  suggested  b\'  topography 
but  was  more  clearly  delineated  b\-  presence  of  a 
groundwater  barrier.  The  most  recent  prc-February-9 
activity  appears,  from  available  data,  to  have  occurred 
thousands  or  even  tens  of  thousands  of  years  ago. 

Other  less  extensive  zones  of  rupture  w  ere  noted 
in  the  Kagel  Can\on  and  Little  Tujunga  area  of  the 
Cit\'  of  Los  Angeles.  Few  structures  were  over  or  im- 
mediately adjacent  to  rupture  zones  due  to  the  more 
remote,   hill\-  nature  of  the  terrain,  so  that  far  less

damage  due  to  fault-induced  ground  rupture  oc- 
curred. Some  commercial  structures  were  affected, 
and  almost  all  of  the  utilities  were  ruptured  and  made 
temporarily  inoperative. 

Fault  offset  was  measurable  in  the  residential  tract 
at  the  northerl\-  terminus  of  Hubbard  Street  in  the 
suburb  of  Sylmar.  In  this  zone,  the  vertical  fault  off- 
set was  6  inches  to  .^0  inches  and  t\pificd  the  high- 
angle  reverse  fault  pattern  of  the  February  9  earth- 
quake. The  tract  directl\'  affected  was  in  various 
stages  of  construction,  ranging  from  occupied  homes 
to  structures  in  the  framing  stage.  .\11  were  greatly 
affected.  See  photos  8,  9,  10,  11,  12  and  figure  2. 

Surface  Rupture  Associated  With  Lurching 

Many  housing  areas  overlying  alluvial  materials 
and/or  pre-1936  fill  materials  were  subjected  to  intense 
shaking  and  resulting  ground  rupture.  The  ruptures 
generally  ranged  from  small  to  hairline  cracks.  Often 
these  cracks  continued  into  the  footings  and  structural 
portions  of  the  residential  units.  Photo  13  was  taken

to  show  the  general  pattern  and  magnitude  of  these 
cracks.  Photos  14,  15,  16,  and  17  were  taken  in  the 
vicinity  between  Olive  View  Hospital  and  the  Vet- 
erans Administration  Hospital.  This  cracking  in  this 
zone  appears  to  be  the  result  of  its  geologic  location. 
The  uplifted  bedrock  mass  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains is  immediately  to  the  north  and  bounds  the  al- 
luvial apron  upon  \\hich  the  housing  area  shown  in 
these  photos  and  Olive  View  Hospital  are  located. 
The  inferred  effect  is  one  of  high  velocity  earthquake 
waves  being  transmitted  through  the  bedrock  into 
alluvial  material  which  slowed  the  velocity  and  con- 
verted the  waves  into  waves  of  lower  velocity  and 
higher  amplitude — thus  creating  slower,  longer  shak- 
ing conducive  to  the  production  of  lurch  cracks. 


I  dispio 


Figure  2.      Sketches    showing    the    type    of    damage    associated     with 
ground   damage,   (figure  6   from   U.S.   Geological  Survey   Bulletin   733) 

A  similar  zone  of  lurch  cracks  bounds  the  zone  of 
fault-induced  rupture  between  Foothill  Boulevard  and 
Hubbard  Street.  Apparently,  when  fault  rupture  oc- 
curs in  an  area  mantled  by  alluvium,  many  of  the  rup- 
tures extend  to  the  surface.  In  addition,  the  energy 
released  in  the  ruptured  zone  resulted  in  intensive 
shaking  which,  in  turn,  created  lurch  cracks. 

Ground  cracks  induced  by  lurching  arc  also 
noticeable  in  areas  of  man-made  fill  extending  from 
Big  Tujunga  Canyon  to  the  Knoll  wood  area  of  Gra- 


nada Hills  and  in  various  locations  within  the  Saugus- 
Newhall  region  (see  photo  18).  The  extent  and  degree 
of  rupturing  appears  to  be  associated  with  the  method 
of  placing  these  fills.  As  an  example,  fills  at  Camp 
Karl  Holtcn  in  Little  Tujunga  Canyon  were  severely 
damaged  (see  photo  19)  as  compared  to  no  noticea- 
ble damage  at  the  Hathawa\-  School,  also  in  Little 
Tujunga  Cannon   (sec  photo   20). 

There  are  three  main  factors  to  consider  when 
evaluating  the  degree  of  rupturing  associated  with 
man-made  fills.  One,  of  course,  is  the  proximity  of  the 
fault  rupture  or  location  of  maximum  energy  release; 
the  second  is  the  type  of  material  (solid  bedrock,  al- 
luvium, water-saturated  alluvium,  etc.)  on  which  the 
fill  is  placed;  and  the  third,  and  most  important,  is  the 
method  of  fill  placement  and  the  supervision  or  quality 
control  factor. 

Damage  Resulting  From  Intense  Shaking 

Generally  there  was  a  direct  correlation  between 
the  amount  of  structural  damage  and  the  proximity  of 
the  location  of  maximum  energy  release  and/or  the  sur- 
face expression  of  the  fault.  Giving  consideration  to 
the  type  of  structure,  the  era  of  construction,  and  the 
degree  of  control  by  both  governmental  agencies  and 
the  contractor  (quality  control)  there  is  still  a  greater 
damage  factor  associated  with  the  nearness  of  the 
energy  release.  Thus  the  San  Fernando-Sylmar  area 
was  most  severely  damaged,  and  the  areas  further 
away  were  less  damaged. 

Settlement  and  Other  Related  Fill  Failures 

Settlement  of  fill  materials  was  noted  from  the  La 
Crescenta  Valley  to  the  Granada  Hills  area  in  the 
fault  zone  and  in  the  Saugus-Newhall  area  near  the 
epicenter.  Generally,  there  was  a  very  noticeable 
relationship  between  the  number  and  degree  of  failures 
and  the  time  the  fill  was  placed.  In  areas  such  as  Kagel 
Canyon,  where  almost  all  of  the  fill  was  placed  prior 
to  the  initiation  of  grading  codes,  failure  was  nearly 
universal.  In  areas  where  the  fill  was  placed  as  an 
engineered  fill,  but  prior  to  the  modern,  effective  grad- 
ing codes  which  \\ere  developed  by  the  City  of  Los 
Angeles  in  1963  and  more  recently  followed  by  Los 
Angeles  County,  the  failures  were  less  extensive.  Few, 
if  any,  failures  occurred  in  areas  graded  since  the  de- 
velopment of  the  modern  codes.  This  strongly  sug- 
gests that  good  engineering  practices  and  quality 
control  supervision  should  be  mandatory  in  areas  sub- 
ject to  earthquake  activity. 

DAMAGE  RELATED  TO  TYPES  AND 
VINTAGE  OF  STRUCTURES 

In  general,  pre- 193  3  residential  structures  sustained 
greater  damage  than  modern  structures.  The  greatest 
damage  appeared  to  be  associated  with  stone  and  other 
masonry  residential  structures,  especially  in  San  Fer- 
nando (see  photos  3  and  21).  Damage  to  multi-story 
apartment  houses  shows  a  strong  relationship  to  vin- 
tage, as  is  indicated  by  figure  1  which  shows  the 
greatest  number  of  vacated  apartment  buildings  to  be 
located  in  the  pre-1933  section  of  Los  Angeles  (Holly- 
wood and  central  Los  Angeles).

The  wood-frame  and  stucco,  one-  and  two-story 
residential  structures  survived  the  earthquake  rela- 
tively well.  Some  of  the  modern,  split-level,  two-story 
residential  structures  with  the  second  floor  over  the 
garage  proved  to  be  very  susceptible  to  earthquake 
failure  (sec  photos  15  and  22).  The  failure  of  this  type 
of  structure  was  related  to  one  or  more  factors.  The 
first  and  most  important  of  these  factors  was  the  lack 
of  structural  wall  support  for  wall  area  occupied  by 
the  garage  door;  steel  bracing  in  the  garage  door  area 
was  shown  on  the  approved  plans  but  was  never 
placed.  A  second  factor  was  related  to  the  often  inade- 


quate structural  tie  btew  ccn  tlie  r\vo-story  portion  and 
the  single-story  portion.  A  third  weakness  was  the 
bracing  of  the  cripple  walls  of  the  one-story  portion 
which  failed,  allowing  this  portion  to  settle,  thus  re- 
moving support  and  alio\\ing  or  causing  failure  of  the 
two-story  portion  (see  photos  23  and  24). 

The  following  are  items  that  were  noted  as  typical 
failures  associated  with  single-family  dwellings  and 
apartment  buildings. 

A.   Chimney  onchoroge:   Pull-out  strips;   nails  pulled   out;   and 
wood-tie  failure  occurred;  chimney  fell  (see  photo  25).

C.  Brocing  in  exferior  walls  and  cripple  walls  of  dwe//ings.- 
Failures  of  wolls  indicated  inadequate  bracing  (see  photo

D.  Cutting,  notching,  ond  boring  of  wood  studs:  Splitting  or 
failure  of  wood  studs  indicated  excessive  cutting,  notching, 
and  boring  of  studs. 

E.  We  and  cement  shingle  root  attachments:  Consideroble 
shifting  of  tile  and  cement  shingles. 

F.  Ties  between  different  levels  of  wood  frome  cons/rucfion 
and  individual  components,  particularly  in  split-level  con- 
struction   and    individual   components:    Numerous    structural 


foilures   occurred    between    different   levels   of   wood    frame 
construction;   large   header   beoms  pulled  away  from  seats. 

G.  Anchoroge  of  wafer  heoters:  Many  water  heaters  fell  over 
in  the  earthquake;  apparently  this  was  usually  the  result  of 
the  utilization  of  flexible  tie  connections. 

H.  Stapled  oncfioroge  of  gypsum  board  and  wo//boord  in 
shear  wo//s:  Staples  did  not  appear  to  hold  as  well  as  nor- 
mal nail  construction;  extensive  cracking  at  gypsum  joints 
was  evident;  improper  adjustment  of  mechanical  stapling 
machines  may  have  been  a  major  factor.

J.  Anchorage  of  non-bearing  parlitions:  Many  non. bearing 
partitions  were  dislodged. 

K.  Anchorage  of  lighting  fixtures:  Mony  lighting  fixtures  fell 
during  the  eorthquoke. 

I.  Accejjibi/ity  of  vlilily  shutoff  devices:  The  movement  of 
water  heaters  and  forced  air  furnaces  created  a  fire  hazard 
due  to  dislocated  gas  lines  and  vents;  the  failure  of  ceiling 
light  fixtures  and  the  dislodging  or  failure  of  wolls  affected 
electrical  systems  and  presented  a  ftre  hazard.

HAZARDOUS  EXTERNAL  CONDITIONS 
Water  Supply 

Tlic  near-failure  of  tiie  San  Fernando  Dam  clearly 
indicated  the  hazard  posed  by  the  presence  of  housing 
areas  in  the  proximit\-  of  a  non-modern  dam  and  reser- 
voir. Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  was  located  \\ithin  2 


miles  of  the  zone  of  fault  rupture  and  on  strike  with 
it  and  high  energy  release.  It  is  assumed  the  equivalent 
peak  lateral  acceleration  in  the  vicinity  of  the  dam  was 
betw  een  0.4g  and  0.5g.  The  force  and  intensity  of  the 
shaking  caused  a  failure  on  the  upstream  side  of  the 
dam.  This  reduced  the  freeboard  to  a  few  feet  and 
placed  the  dam  and  some  80,000  people  immediately 
downstream  in  danger  for  approximately  48  hours.  A 
zone  between  the  San  Diego  Freewa\-  and  Balboa 
Boulevard  extending  from  the  downstream  face  of  the 
dam  near  Rinaldi  Street  to  the  Los  Angeles  River 
Channel  some  7  miles  awa&gt;'  was  evacuated  until  the 
water  level  was  reduced  in  the  reservoir  and  the  haz- 
ard passed  (sec  paper  b\-  Cortripht  in  this  bulletin). 

Modern  dams  constructed  \\  ith  modern  equipment, 
current  engineering  techniques,  and,  above  all,  ade- 
quate knowledge  of  the  geologic  environment  should 
not  present  a  similar  hazard.  Lower  San  Fernando 
Dam  was  completed  first  in  191.')  utilizing  conven- 
tional hydraulic  fill.  Upper  San  Fernando  Dam,  com- 
pleted b\-  the  semi-li\'draulic  fill  method  in  1921,  also 
sustained  damage.  A  new  smaller  dam  w  ithin  the  \'^an 
Xorman  Reservoir  Complex  survived  the  earthquake 
without  damage.  The  concrete-arch  Pacoima  Dam 
sustained  no  significant  damage  in  spite  of  high  ground 
acceleration. 

Several  large  water  storage  tanks  were  damaged. 
The  most  spectacular  damage  was  to  the  tank  at  Olive 
\'icw  Hospital  w  hich  developed  a  w  rinkle  at  the  base 
and  ruptured  as  shown  in  photo  27.  Others  included 
the  large  Los  Angeles  Department  of  Water  and 
Power  Sesnon  Tank  in  the  Porter  Ranch  area  and  a 
Metropolitan  \\'ater  District  tank  near  the  Jensen  Fil- 
tration Plant.  Almost  all  of  the  storage  tanks  in  the 
S\lmar-San  Fernando  area  were  toppled,  ruptured,  or 
liad  their  attachment  lines  severed. 

The  water  system  for  the  City  of  San  Fernando  was 
devastated.  The  sole  suppl\"  from  a  once  intricate  sys- 
tem of  wells  and  tanks  was  one  well  in  the  northern 
section  of  town.  Wells  were  ruptured;  reservoirs  were 
cracked  (two  beyond  repair);  and  the  distribution 
SNStem  was  so  fractured  that  it  had  to  be  almost  en- 
tirely rebuilt. 

Among  the  hazards  associated  w  ith  urban  develop- 
ment in  areas  subject  to  earthquakes  are  the  damaging 
effect  on  the  suppl&gt;-  system  and  the  hazards  presented 
1)\-  older  reservoirs.  Many  households  in  the  Sylmar- 
San  Fernando  area  were  without  Cit&gt;'  water  for  1 
week  to  4  weeks. 

Other  Utilities 

Natural  gas  lines  within  the  Sylmar-San  Fernando 
area  were  ruptured,  creating  a  danger.  FTad  these  fail- 
ures occurred  during  working  hours  when  traffic 
would  have  been  heavier,  the  danger  of  fires  would 
also  ha\e  been  much  greater.  These  failures  also  left 
many  people  w  ithout  gas  for  cooking  and  heating  for 
many  weeks. 

Electrical  lines  were  severed,  creating  a  fire  danger 
and  a  potential  for  electrocution.  The  electrical  sys- 
tems w  ithin  the  main  area  of  devastation  were  non- 
functional for  periods  up  to  a  week.  Some  fires  at- 
tributed to  electrical  failures  did  occur,  and  a  few

homes  were  lost  due  to  fire.  Another  difficulty  asso- 
ciated with  this  type  of  fire  is  the  inability  to  contact 
the  fire  department  following  an  earthquake  because 
of  telephone  malfunction. 

Other  utilities  that  were  damaged,  directly  affecting 
the  residential  areas  of  Sylmar-San  Fernando  and  some 
of  the  immediately  adjacent  areas,  were:  Se\\er  lines, 
which  became  inoperative,  creating  potential  ground- 
water pollution;  Streets,  impeding  and  halting  traffic; 
storm  drains;  telephone  facilities,damaged  by  severed 
lines  and  devastated  plants;  reduction  in  hospital  and 
other  emergency  facilities'  availability,  and  partial  loss 
of  communication  with  emergency  equipment.  Good 
communications  during  and  after  an  earthquake  are 
imperative,  and  a  workable  emergenc\'  information 
plan  must  be  prepared  before  the  next  earthquake 
occurs. 

In  conclusion,  damage  to  public  facilities  greatly 
endangered  and  inconvenienced  the  inhabitants  of  the 
residential  areas  and  demonstrated  the  total  reliance 
on  these  systems  by  people  living  in  modern  urban 
areas. 

CODE  CHANGES  AND  CONSTRUCTION 
TECHNIQUE  REVISIONS 

As  a  result  of  the  February  9,  1971,  earthquake, 
many  jurisdictions  and  governmental  entities  have 
changed  or  are  changing  codes  and  regulations  regard- 
ing earthquake  hazards.  Almost  all  should  be  beneficial; 
some  appear  to  be  nonfunctional  and  confusing;  and 
one  possible  change  appears  to  be  a  step  backward. 
Probably  the  most  realistic  and  beneficial  are  the 
changes  that  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  has  made  in  its 
building  codes  and  requirements  for  the  design  of 
structures  in  urban  areas  subject  to  earthquake  activity. 

The  changes  in  building  codes  for  the  City  of  Los 
Angeles  will  provide  greater  safety  and  hopefulh-  will 
eliminate  many,  if  not  almost  all,  of  the  problems  that 
led  to  damage  in  the  February  9  earthquake.  The  in- 
crease in  cost  for  a  typical  single-family  dwelling  or 
apartment  building  should  be  minimal.  Estimates  indi- 


^ 


cate  that  the  increase  should  be  less  than  1  percent  of 
the  total  construction  cost.  The  majority  of  the 
changes  in  the  code  are  those  requiring  closer  super- 
vision and  quality  control  of  w  ork  performed. 

It  is  feared  by  some  conmiunity  leaders  that  high 
standards  and  strict  enforcement  may  drive  away  the 
building  industry,  but  public  safety  suffers  wherever 
this  philosophy  prevails.  Some  feel  that  the  need  to  re- 
establish the  econonn-  promptly  must  be  given  prime 
consideration,  and  thus  some  local  governments  tend 
to  reduce  standards  rather  than  require  the  high  stand- 
ards essential  to  prevent  repetition  of  the  same  errors 
and  damage. 

Some  of  the  obvious  and  necessary  changes  that 
the  City  of  Los  Angeles  has  made  in  their  building 
requirements  are  listed  in  the  Appendix  to  this  report.

t'lon  engineering,  seismic  engineering,  and  engineering 
geology  reports  for  all  major  structures.  In  addition, 
similar  detailed  data  will  become  a  requirement  for 
urban  development  within  areas  subject  to  earthquake 
hazards  located  in  the  City  and  County  of  Los  An- 
geles. Hopefully,  to  prevent  and/or  minimize  the  dam- 
age and  loss  of  life  wrought  by  the  earthquake,  which 
is  one  of  the  greatest  of  the  geologic  hazards,  other 
jurisdictions  and  governmental  entities  will  require 
similar  technical  data. 

A  report  of  the  *'Task  Force  on  Earthquake  Haz- 
ard Reduction,  May  4,  1970"  issued  by  the  Institute  of 
Governmental  Studies  at  the  University  of  California, 
Berkeley,  suggested: 

"Urban  Planning  for  Seismic  Safely 

All  plans  and  land  use  controls  at  every  level — federal, 
state,  regional,  and  local — should  have  earthquake-anticipa- 
tion components  suited  to  prevailing  seismic  and  soil  condi- 
tions. 

1.  Urban  areas  near  geologically  young  or  active  earth- 
quake faults,  and  those  farther  away  that  are  likely  to  expe- 
rience significant  earthquake  shaking,  should  be  zoned  for 
building  purposes.  Construction  in  such  zones  should  be  subject 
to  regulations  by  governmental  agencies  that  are  capable  of 
administering  and  enforcing  them  on  fair  and  equitable  bases. 
These  controls  should  be  designed  to  minimize  future  casualties 
and  property  damage,  so  far  as  is  economically  feasible.  The 
regulations  should  be  related  to  the  proximity  of  faults,  the 
likelihood  of  major  earthquakes,  estimates  of  their  probable 
maximum  magnitude,  soil  and  water-table  conditions,  hills  and 
other  natural  features,  population  concentrations,  and  the  de- 
gree to  which  known  hazards  can  be  minimized  by  raising 
design  standards. 

2.  As  the  state  governments  expand  their  roles  In  earth- 
quake-hazards reduction,  they  will  need  to  include  earthquake 
anticipation  components  in  all  planning  for  state-supported 
facilities,  and  to  require  appropriate  earthquake-anticipation 
components   in   the    plans   of  all   subsidiary   local    governments. 

Information  Before,  During  and  After  Earthquakes 

1.  Data  on  ground  movement  should  be  obtained  before, 
during   and   after   major  earthquakes.  Special   efforts   must  be

devoted  to  the  placement  of  additionol  strong-motion  seismic 
equipment.  This  is  essential  for  the  collection  of  information 
needed  to  develop  improved  structural  designs  for  earthquake 
resistance.  Because  of  their  crucial  nature,  strong-motion  data 
on  destructive  earthquakes  anywhere  in  the  world  should  be 
obtained,  whenever  possible. 

2.  Better  mops  of  several  kinds  are  required,  including  more 
definitive  selsmicity  or  earthquake  probability  mops;  more 
detailed  [maps  of]  earthquake  geologic  hazards  of  metropoli- 
tan areas;  more  Informative  maps  of  faults  (Including  dis- 
placement histories,  especially  over  the  past  two  million  yeors); 
and  improved  maps  of  deposits  at  or  near  the  surface. 

3.  The  earthquake  safety  of  older  structures  should  be  re- 
appraised, OS  should  that  of  old  and  new  facilities  when  new 
hozords  ore  discovered. 

4.  Public  ofRcIols,  the  public  and  disaster  relief  agencies 
such  OS  the  Red  Cross,  should  be  appropriately  and  system- 
atically involved  in  planning  how  best  to  prepare  for  an  earth- 
quake. They  should  be  thoroughly  briefed  on  what  to  do  dur- 
ing and  after  on  earthquake.  State  and  local  governments 
need  Informotlon  on  the  protective  and  recovery  measures  that 
can  be  taken. 


5.  During  and  after  on  earthquake,  good  communicotions 
will  be  essential  among  responsible  federal,  state,  and  local 
ofRcials,  and  voluntary  relief  agencies  such  as  the  Red  Cross. 
If  this  goal  Is  to  be  ochieved,  a  centralized  emergency  infor- 
mation facility — and  a  workoble  emergency  Information  plan 
— must  be  in  existence  before  the  earthquake  occurs," 

The  California  Legislature  has  considered  a  num- 
ber of  bills  related  to  earthquake  studies,  safety,  and 
insurance.  Possibly  the  most  beneficial  measure  to  the 
home  owner,  if  passed,  would  be  one  w  hich  requires 
that  engineering  geology  reports  be  submitted  for  all 
future  subdivisions  in  California  where  geologic  haz- 
ards exist.

"SEISMICITY  SECTION'' 

The  guide  that  follows  was  submitted  to  the  Qty

the  Association  of  Engineering  Geologists.  It  was  sub- 
mitted as  a  guide  for  the  preparation  of  the  "Seismicity 
Section"  that  will  be  required  in  the  Engineering  Ge- 
ology reports  that  are  currentl\-  required  by  the  Cit&gt;' 
of  Los  Angeles.  The  scope  and  geographical  references 
can  be  expanded  slightly,  and  this  guide  could  become 
useful  for  other  geographical  areas. 

These  seismic  or  earthquake  sections  to  the  engi- 
neering geology  reports  may  be  requested  or  prepared 
for  projects  ranging  in  size  from  a  single  lot  to  a 
master  plan  for  large  acreage  and  in  scope  from  a 
single-famil\'  dwelling  to  large  engineered  structures 
such  as  hospitals  and  high-rise  buildings  and  for  geo- 
graphic sites  near  a  potentially  active  fault  to  more 
remote  sites.  A  format  should  be  flexible  in  approach, 
method,  and  technique.  This  format  permits  tailoring 


to  the  appropriate  scope  and  the  opportunity  for  re- 
sponsible additions  as  the  state  of  the  art  improves. 
The  investigation  should  be  adjusted  to  the  magnitude 
of  the  environmental  factors  affecting  seismic  risk  and 
.safet\-  and  to  the  intended  use. 

In  view  of  the  seismicity  of  the  entire  southern 
California  area,  engineering  geology  reports  submitted 
to  the  City  of  Eos  Angeles  should  include  seismic  data 
which  bear  a  relationship  to  tlie  geologic  stability  of 
tlie  landscape  and  the  proposed  structures  to  be  placed 
there. 

The  seismic  evaluation  of  a  site  for  land  use  plan- 
ning needs  to  be  thorough  enough  to  cover  all  type 
of  potential  earthquake  or  seismic  damage  but  lucid 
enough  so  that  it  is  understandable  to  the  layman.  The 
common  earthquake-related  phenomena  that  should  be

considered  by  the  engineering  geologist  in  his  ap- 
praisal of  the  over-all  seismic  risk  and  safety  are: 
(1)  ground  displacement  along  a  fault,  (2)  ground 
failure  (liquefaction,  settlement,  landsliding),  and  (3) 
ground  shaking.  In  presenting  such  data,  the  engineer- 
ing geologist  should  give  a  brief  but  clear  description 
of  the  seismic  and  tectonic  history  of  the  area  and 
for  the  site.  In  addition,  attention  should  be  given  to 
geologic  features  \\hich  ma\-  adversely  affect  the  site 
in  the  event  of  a  large  earthquake  in  the  general  area 
or,  if  probable,  lesser  magnitude  earthquakes  nearby.

The  seismic  section  of  the  engineering  consul-

tiic  major  or  regional  faults  and  a  discussion  of  the 
tectonic  mcclianics  and  other  relationships  of  signifi- 
cance; location  of  local  faults  and  a  discussion  of  their 
relationship  to  the  regional  fault  pattern;  evidences  of 
local  or  regional  fault  strain  and  creep;  pertinent 
parameters  of  ground  motion  and  focal  mechanics, 
if  known. 

It  is  relatively  easy  to  justify  and  prepare  building 
codes  that  provide  great  safety.  The  performance  of 
single-famil\'  residential  structures  during  the  Febru- 
ary 9,  1971,  earthquake  is  a  tribute  to  American  sci- 
ence, engineering,  and  skills.  In  contrast  to  the  r\vo 
casualties  out  of  an  estimated  2.5  million  living  in  the 
area  of  strong  motion  shaking  from  an  earthquake  of 
6.5  magnitude,  an  earthquake  of  lesser  magnitude  (5.7) 
struck  the  coast  of  North  .Africa  in  1960  and  killed 
approximately  one-third  of  tiiose  residing  in  the  town 
of  .Agadir  (casualties  estimated  at  11,000  out  of  a  total 
population  of  33,000).  Alany  other  such  examples  can 


be  given  for  other  areas  of  the  world  subject  to  earth- 
quake hazards.  Consequentl&gt;',  even  though  the  mone- 
tar\-  loss  was  high,  tiie  number  of  casualties  and  the 
actual  percentage  of  loss  of  dwellings  at  San  Fernando 
was  low.  An  estimated  830  residential  structures  were 
demolished  or  required  major  rehabilitation  out  of  a 
total  of  approximately  400,000  residential  structures  in 
close  proximit_\-  to  the  earthquake,  or  about  0.2  per- 
cent as  compared  to  a  30  percent  to  90  percent  loss  by 
earthquakes  in  some  other  areas  of  the  world.  It  should 
be  reiterated  that  the  greatest  damage  in  the  San  Fer- 
nando earthquake  occurred  to  the  older  dwellings 
which  were  built  prior  to  the  1933  Long  Beach  earth- 
quake and  the  development  of  modern  codes  and  the 
Field  Act.  It  can  be  assumed  that  almost  all  of  the 
structures  that  sustained  great  damage  would  have 
withstood  the  effects  or  would  have  received  much 
less  damage  if  built  to  the  new  codes  established  by  the 
Cit}'  of  Los  Angeles.  Tiic  exception  to  this  condition 
would  be  dwellings  w  hich  might  be  constructed  di- 
rectly over  rupture  directl\'  associated  with  fault  dis- 
placement. 

The  dangers  associated  with  fault  displacement 
can  be  essentially  eliminated  b\-  proper  master  plan 
design  or  zoning.  One  of  the  first  attempts  to  reduce 
the  earthquake-fault  hazard  by  the  effective  use  of  a 
master  plan  was  the  Porter  Ranch  development — 
planned  in  the  early  1960s.  The  Santa  Susana  fault  sys- 
tem was  recognized  as  well  as  geologic  indications  that 
the  fault  had  been  active  as  recently  as  10,000  to 
11,000  years  ago.  Even  though  the  code  did  not  re- 
quire that  earthquake  hazards  be  given  consideration 
in  master  plan  design  or  in  engineering  and  engineer- 
ing geology  studies,  the  Design  Engineers  accepted  the 
geologic  data  and  recommendations  that  no  portion  of 
the  development  be  placed  on  the  upper  thrust  plate 
of  the  fault.  Photo  2  8  is  of  the  central  portion  of  the 
Porter  Ranch  project;  the  Santa  Susana  fault  s\-stem

Tlicsc  same  geologic  data  were  later  utilized  to 
discourage  one  of  the  major  water  purveyors  from 
constructing  a  dam  on  the  fault  trace,  with  the  pro- 
posed reservoir  to  be  located  on  tiic  upper  thrust  plate. 
The  Scsnon  Water  Tank,  w  liich  was  severel&gt;'  dam- 
aged, was,  however,  placed  approximately  on  the  trace 
of  the  fault  zone — contrar\-  to  the  recommendations  of 
the  engineering  geologist  under  contract. 

It  seems  logical  that  all  future  designs  for  urban 
development  in  California  should  give  full  considera- 
tion to  earthquake  as  well  as  other  geologic  hazards. 
At  small  added  cost,  man  can  design  and  construct 
dwellings  to  w  ithstand  almost  all  earthquake  activity. 
However,  he  should  give  very  detailed  consideration 
to  designing  the  plan  so  that  structures  arc  not  pro- 
posed or  constructed  on  the  trace  of  potentially  active 
faults,  as  it  is  currently-  not  possible  to  construct  dwell- 
ings that  can  withstand  fault  displacement. 

Other  factors  that  should  be  given  careful  thought 
while  designing  a  master  plan  in  earthquake-prone 
areas  are: 

1)  Methods  of  placing  engineered  fiil  to  reduce  the  effects  of 
lurching.  This  method  should  include  detailed  soil  engineering 
and  engineering  geology  studies  as  well  as  supervision  during 
construction  to  assure  that  all  unsuitable  materials  are  re- 
moved and  that  the  fill  is  founded  on  materials  which  can 
support   it  so   OS  to  render   the   fill   safe  and   stable.   2)   Areas 


that  may  be  subject  to  subsidence  and/or  consolidation,  so  as 
to  ovoid  them  as  building  sites  unless  rendered  safe  and 
stable.  Generally,  such  oreos  con  be  reodily  interwoven  into 
the  greenbelt  or  noturol  preserve  portions  of  the  plan  or 
utilized  for  recreational  purposes.  3)  Areas  thot  possess  the 
potential  for  liquefaction.  4)  Topographic  high  oreos  which 
possess  adverse  geologic  conditions  that  could  become  the 
sites  of  landslides,  rockfolls,  or  other  moss  movements  should 
be  ovoided  os  should  the  areas  above  and  below.  More  than 
1000  landslides  of  vorying  sizes  and  dimensions  were  trig- 
gered by  the  February  9,  1971,  earthquake.  Many  of  the 
larger  ancient  landslides  of  southern  Colifornio  were  appar- 
ently triggered  by  past  earthquake  activity.  Thus  it  becomes 
apparent  that  thorough  soil  engineering  and  engineering 
geology  studies  should  be  required  for  all  areas  possessing 
geologic  hazards.  The  Turnagoin  Bay  landslide  thot  devas- 
tated a  housing  tract  in  Anchorage,  Alaska,  is  a  good  ex- 
ample of  what  con  happen  and  why  these  studies  ore  neces- 
sary. 5)  The  method  of  placing  engineered  fill  so  os  to  prevent 
londsliding  or  settlement  of  the  fill.  Engineered  fill  should  be 
placed  in  accordance  with  good  practices  and  the  provisions 
of  Chapter  70  most  current  Edition  of  the  Uniform  Building 
Code.  Detailed  soil  engineering  and  engineering  geology 
investigations  can  be  utilized  to  determine  where  and  how 
fill  materials  can  be  safely  placed. 

In  summary,  it  is  possible  through  prudent  plan- 
ning or  zoning  to  avoid  the  obvious  hazards  and  elimi- 
nate or  remedy  other  hazards.  Since  open  space, 
grecnbelts,  and  natural  preserves  are  a  parr  of  all  ir.od-

crn  master  plans,  it  becomes  obvious  that  these  ameni- 
ties can  be  designed  so  that  the  hazardous  areas  are  not 
used  for  dwellings  or  other  structures.  Many  of  the 
areas  hazardous  for  structures  can  be  used  for  recrea- 
tional and  park  facilities.  It  would  be  much  better  to 
have  a  greenbelt,  bicycle  trails,  or  parks  along  a  poten- 
tially active  fault  trace  rather  than  housing.  By  ar- 
ranging land  use  to  the  environmental  controls  rather 
than  attempting  to  force  the  environment  to  adjust  to 
the  plan,  man  can  avoid  many  geologic  hazards.  We 
can  adjust  to  the  environment  and,  through  science 
and  engineering,  use  it  effectively,  efficiently,  and 
safely.  We  cannot  continue  to  force  nature  to  adjust 
to  man's  desires. 

Legislation  must  be  passed  which  requires  realistic 
and  prudent  use  of  geologic  data  and  engineering  cri- 
teria to  decrease  the  hazards  related  to  earthquakes. 
Man  has  the  tools  and  knowledge  to  greatly  increase 
the  safety  of  living  in  California  and  at  a  very  modest 
cost.  California  can  be  the  leader  in  earthquake  knowl- 
edge and  design. 

In  relation  to  the  subject  of  zoning,  this  quotation 
from  the  "Task  Force  on  Earthquake  Hazard  Reduc- 
tion, May  4,  1970"  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Govern- 
mental Studies  at  the  University  of  California,  Berke- 
ley, is  pertinent: 

"Zoning  and  Police  Power 

4.  The  zoning  of  bays,  shorelines,  floodplains,  wetlands  and 
open  space  hos  established  ample  precedent  for  limiting  or 
prohibiting  land  development  when  an  important  public  in- 
terest is  at  stake.  These  same  principles  apply  in  the  case  of 
zoning  to  reduce  earthquake  hazards,  or  prevent  their  crea- 
tion by  future  urban  development.  In  addition  to  zoning, 
building  code  restrictions  are,  or  course,  a  time-honored  exer- 
cise of  the  police  power. 

5.  Inadequacies  in  seismic  safety  controls  are  obviously  not 
caused  by  a  lack  of  legal  aufhority.  The  real  problem  lies  in 
these  circumstances:  (1)  the  primary  pow^r  to  regulate  and 
enforce  is  lodged  with  the  cities  and  counties,  many  of  which 
have  proven  vulnerable  to  developmental  pressures;  (2)  local 
political  "will"  is  often  lacking  for  the  adoption  of  strong 
regulations  where  they  ore  necessary;  and  (3)  local  staff 
capabilities  ore  too  limited  to  insure  thorough  and  uniform 
enforcement.  Consequently  we  cannot  rely  solely  on  local 
government  to  provide  the  policing  required  for  effective 
earthquake-hazard  reduction." 

CONCLUSIONS 

Even  though  the  earthquake  on  February  9,  1971, 
damaged  approximately  20,000  houses — destro&gt;'ing  or 
nearly  destroying  830  of  them — it  can  be  concluded 
that  the  residential  structures  performed  extreme!)' 
well  from  the  standpoint  of  safety,  considering  the 
forces  involved.  No  occupied  residential  structure  col- 
lapsed as  a  result  of  shaking  although  a  few  were  de- 
stroyed b\'  fire.  Structures. overlying  and  immediately 
adjacent  to  zones  of  rupture  associated  with  fault  dis- 
placement \\ere  more  greatly  damaged  than  those  a 
few  blocks  awa\'.  Single-stor\'  residential  structures 
generally  fared  better  than  two-story  homes — split 
level  structures  with  the  second  story  over  the  garage 
suffering  the  worst  fate.  Failures  were  generalh' 
related  to  the  type  of  foundation  materials  in  the  fol- 
lowing order:  1)  Those  constructed  on  older  (pre- 
1963)  fill  which  was  either  not  properly  engineered 


or  where  alluvial-slopewash  was  not  removed  prior  to 
placement  of  fill  were  the  most  severely  damaged;  2) 
those  on  loose  alluvial  foundation  materials  were  less 
damaged;  3)  those  on  semi-consolidated  alluvial  mate- 
rials were  even  less  damaged;  and  4)  those  founded  on 
properly  engineered  fill  or  bedrock  were  least  dam- 
aged. 

Revisions  to  building  codes  such  as  those  prepared 
b\'  the  Technical  Advisory  Board  for  the  City  of  Los 
Angeles,  Department  of  Building  and  Safety  (see  Ap- 
pendix) will  improve  the  safety  of  residential  develop- 
ment. It  appears  that  strengthening  of  structures  can 
be  accomplished  in  design  and  construction  at  a  very 
small  increase  in  cost  of  construction. 

Requirements  for  complete  geologic  and  engineer- 
ing studies  prior  to  design  of  major  engineering  works 
or  adoption  of  master  plans  will  further  reduce  the 
hazards  presented  by  earthquakes.  Finall}',  but  not 
least  in  virtue,  the  proper  use  of  engineering  and  geo- 
logic data  for  zoning  can  be  a  verj'  effective  mecha- 
nism in  reducing  the  danger  to  the  public. 

Review  of  the  geologic  features  near  the  site  that 
may  indicate  recent  fault  or  seismic  activit&gt;'.  The 
amount  of  detail  in  the  study  should  be  commensu- 
rate with  the  intended  land  use,  the  complexity  of  the 
area,  and  the  seismic  historj-.  If  such  features  exist,  this 
review  should  include  a  field  investigation  of: 

Location  of  historic  or  recent  ground  rupture  or  displace- 
ment along  faults  and  location  of  other  earthquake-induced 
ruptures  such  as  are  caused  by  lurching,  settlement,  and 
liquefaction.  The  evidence  for  existence  of  ground  rupture 
should  include:  location,  orientation,  length,  width,  and  other 
physical  characteristics  of  ruptures;  estimate  of  amount  and 
sense  of  displacement  on  ruptures;  type  of  faults  and  dating 
of  most  recent  displacement  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
inferred  surface  effects  and  estimated  acceleration  and  age 
of  youngest  faulted  unit  (including  soil). 

Examination  of  stereoscopic  time-lapse  aerial  photographs 
with  special  emphasis  on  fault  location. 

Review  of  survey  and  strain  gauge  records  to  determine  if 
strain  or  creep  is  discernible. 

Leveling  records  (for  example,  Baldwin  Hills  indicating  area 
of  subsidence). 

Field  mapping  of  foults,  using  detail  commensurate  with 
intended  land  use.  The  geologic  map  and/or  geologic  report 
for  the  site  shall  show  or  report  upon  any  geologic  feotures 
relating  to  the  presence  of  faults  on  the  site  or  in  nearby 
areas  (sag  ponds,  offset  bedding,  offset  drainoge  courses, 
offset  ridges,  kerncols,  shutterridges,  foceted  spurs,  scarps, 
vegetation  alignments).  The  thickness  and  nature  of  the  various 
earth  materiols  which  affect  the  seismic  damage  potential  of 
a  site  should  be  reported. 

Review  of  ground  water  data  to  determine  if  ground-water 
barriers  or  other  ground-water  anomalies  moy  suggest  the 
presence  of  a  fault  or  fault  activity. 

Record  of  earthquake  domage.  Analysis  should  be  made  of 
all  site  damage  sustained  due  to  shaking,  surface  fault  rup- 
ture, or  other  causes  related  to  earthquakes  in  historic  times. 
Analysis  may  include  damage  factors  in  nearby  pertinent 
areas. 

Exploration  may  be  required  if  the  site  is  on  or 
near  an  active  or  potentially  active  fault.  The  explora- 
tion should  be  tailored  to  the  scope  of  the  investiga- 
tion, since  different  physical  situations  demand  differ- 
ent approaches.  The  methods  of  exploration  may 
include,  but  not  be  limited  to:

1)  Trenching  ocross  active  foult  lones  and  probable  or  pos- 
sible octive  foults  to  determine  width  of  lone,  nature  of  zone 
materials,  recency  of  movement,  location  of  active  troce  within 
the  zone,  and  onolysis  of  fault  plane  geometry.  Orientation  of 
trenches  should  be  shown  on  the  geologic  map;  logs  of 
trenches  shall  be  included  within  the  geologic  report.  2)  Geo- 
physical studies  which  may  indicate  types  of  materials,  depth 
to  ground  water,  ground  water  anomalies,  depth  to  bedrock, 
subsurface  fault  displacement,  and  dynomi:  properties  of  sur. 
flcial  soils  and  rocks  Including  at  least  density  and  velocity. 
3)  Borings  to  determine  earth  materials  and  depth  to  water, 
to  obtain  samples  of  soil  for  analysis  by  soils  engineering  and 
geophysicol  surveys,  and  to  provide  additional  pertinent  in- 
formation. 

Other  data  that  may  be  significant  in  evaluating 
the  seismic  relationship  of  the  site  and  the  intended 
land  use,  including  but  not  limited  to: 

The  types  of  earth  materials  that  structures  will  be  founded 
on;  the  distribution,  thickness,  and  origin  of  surface  soils,  allu- 
vium, and  alluvium-like  materials  (this  may  include  some  poorly 
consolidated  Plio-Pleistocene  sedimentary  rock  materials);  the 
depth  to  bedrock  materials  (specifically  hard  rock  moterials) 
ond  character  of  bedrock  materials;  location  of  the  water 
table,  variation  in  water  levels,  and  such  anomalies  as  ground- 
water barriers;  and  the  topographic  setting. 

Graphic  materials  will  be  helpful  in  presenting 
much  of  the  data.  These  materials  should  include: 
various  kinds  of  geologic  maps,  cross  sections,  trcncii 
and  borehole  logs,  and  geophysical  profiles. 

For  sites  on  or  near  active  or  potentially  active 
fault  zones,  geologic  investigation  should  be  directed 
at  determining  the  history  of  earthquake-related 
ground  rupture,  particularly  displacement. 

Perhaps  the  most  important  sections  of  the  report 
are  the  conclusions  and  recommendations.  They  ma\' 
be  brief  or  very  detailed.  Thc&gt;-  ma\-  include  but  need 
not  be  limited  to: 

Estimate  of  magnitudes  of  earthquakes  that  may  be  gen- 
erated on   faults   near  enough  to  af?ect  the  site,  the  distance 


of  the  faults  from  the  site,  and  the  probable  mognitude  of 
the  earthquake  ot  the  epicenter  and  at  the  site. 

An  over-all  seismic  evaluation  of  the  site  based  on  the  his- 
tory and  potential  for  ground  displacement  due  to  faulting, 
ground  shaking,  ground  rupture  due  to  lurching,  liquefaction, 
settlement  of  soils  and  fill,  landslide  octivity,  and  failure  re- 
lated to  high  fluid  pressure. 

An  evaluation  should  be  presented  of  the  geologic  or  engi- 
neered features  that  may  effect  the  site  if  on  earthquake 
should  occur.  These  could  include:  steep  slopes  and  cliffs,  ex- 
cavated slopes,  sidehill  fills,  thick  or  deep  fills,  high  woter 
toble,  topogrophy,  and  other  pertinent  features. 

Delineation  of  zones  of  varying  risk. 

Determination  of  the  potential  acceleration  thot  may  affect 
the  site,  detailing  the  type  of  underlying  materials  (for  ex- 
ample, bedrock,  firm  sediments,  soft  sediments,  or  soft,  satu- 
rated sediments). 

Analysis  of  the  proposed  development  and/or  grading  con- 
sidering the  earth  materials  and  an  over-all  geologic  environ- 
ment in  relation  to  seismic  potential. 

Analysis  of  placement  ond/or  orientation  of  structures,  in 
regard  to  seismic  potential,  especially  location  with  respect  to 
noturol  geologic  features;  possible  effect  of  offsite  properties; 
possible  effects  of  offsite  engineered  structures;  possible  effect 
on  utilities. 

These  studies  should  be  prepared  by  geologists, 
seismologists,  and  engineers  in  conformit&gt;-  with  profes- 
sional registration  laws  of  tiie  state. 

PLANNING  AND  ZONING  AS  TOOLS  IN 
REDUCING  EARTHQUAKE  HAZARD 

Currently,  the  most  efficient  and  effective  methods 
of  reducing  earthquake  dangers  are:  (1)  to  provide 
realistic  codes  or  guidelines  for  construction  such  as 
those  of  the  City  of  Los  .\ngcles  and  (2)  to  prepare 
master  plans  for  urban  development  that  \\ill  a\oid  or 
compensate  for  the  hazards.

San  Fernando  Earthquake  and

ABSTRACT 

Improved  hypocentral  locations  have  been  obtained 
for  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  and  its  larger  after- 
shocks through  the  use  of  data  from  portable  stations 
installed  In  and  around  the  aftershock  area  subsequent 
to  the  main  shock.  The  main  shock,  at  14  00  41.8  GMT 
on  9  February  1971,  is  now  assigned  a  magnitude  (MjJ  of 
6.4  and  a  location  at  34°  24.7'  N,  118°  24.0'  W,  h  = 
8.4  km.  Fifty-five  aftershocks  of  magnitude  4.0  and  greater 
had  occurred  through  31  December  1971.  The  lunate- 
shaped  epicentral  distribution  of  aftershocks  is  consistent 
with  the  idea  of  southward  thrusting  along  a  disc-shaped 
fault  surface,  and  aftershock  depths  as  well  as  aftershock 
focal  mechanisms  suggest  that  the  thrust  surface  dips  about 
35°  toward  N  20°  E.  However,  a  distinct  linear  alignment 
of  left-lateral  strike-slip  aftershocks  parallel  to  the  motion 
direction  near  the  west  boundary  of  activity  suggests  that 
the  fault  surface  has  a  steep  flexure  along  this  line,  down- 
stepped  to  the  west,  and  both  the  planar  distribution  of 
aftershocks  and  the  local  geology  support  this  concept. 


The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  describe  the  seis- 
mologic  aspects  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  9 
February  1971  and  its  aftershocks  and  to  interpret 
these  earthquakes  in  terms  of  a  tectonic  model  of  the 
associated  faulting.  Several  reports  on  these  subjects 
were  prepared  by  the  authors  within  3  weeks  follow- 
ing the  earthquake  (Allen  et  al.,  1971;  Hanks  et  al., 
1971;  Whitcomb,  1971;  Division  of  Geological  and 
Planetary  Sciences,  1971),  and  this  paper  updates 
these  studies  utilizing  information  recorded  by  the 
Caltech  network  through  31  December  1971.  By  this 
time,  the  principal  aftershock  activity  seems  to  have 
concluded,  although  small  aftershocks  still  continue. 
During  the  seismological  investigations,  particular  ef- 
fort has  been  made  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the 
tectonic  mechanism  of  the  earthquake — the  configura- 
tion of  the  fault  surface,  the  source  mechanism  of  the 
main  shock  and  aftershocks,  and  the  tectonic  environ- 
ment of  the  faulted  region.  Preliminary  conclusions 
on   these   topics   are   summarized   herein,   although    it

should  be  recognized  that  studies  are  vigorously  con- 
tinuing, and  much  detailed  substantiating  evidence  as 
well  as  possible  modifications  will  be  presented  in  sub- 
sequent papers. 

SE]SMOlOGlC  ENVIRONMENT 

In  the  years  prior  to  1971,  the  San  Fernando  area 
was  characterized  by  low  to  moderate  seismic  activity 
not  unlike  that  of  many  other  parts  of  southern  Cali- 
fornia. Indeed,  the  1934-1963  strain-release  maps  (Al- 
len et  al.,  1965)  indicated  that  the  northern  San  Fer- 
nando Valley  was  seismically  less  active  than  most 
other  parts  of  the  greater  Los  Angeles  area.  Nothing 
that  has  been  recognized  in  the  very  recent  seismic 
history  seems  to  suggest  that  this  area,  more  than  any 
other  area,  was  particularly  likely  to  experience  a  mag- 
nitude 6.4  earthquake.  It  should  be  kept  in  mind,  how- 
ever, that  an  earthquake  of  at  least  this  magnitude 
occurs  somewhere  in  the  southern  California  region 
on  the  average  of  about  once  every  4  years  (Allen 
et  ill.,  1965),  and  in  this  sense  the  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake was  no  great  surprise.  An  earthquake  of  this 
same  magnitude  occurred  in  1968  in  the  Borrego 
Alountain  area  220  km  southeast  of  Los  Angeles,  but 
damage  was  small  because— unlike  the  1971  event — it 
occurred  in  a  remote  location. 

Bet\veen  1934  and  1971,  which  is  the  interval  during 
which  epicentral  locations  of  southern  California  earth- 
quakes have  been  listed  by  the  California  Institute  of 
Technology,  only  about  ten  earthquakes  of  magnitude 
3.0  and  greater  occurred  in  the  area  that  corresponds 
to  the  epicentral  region  of  the  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake (Figures  1,  2).  Prior  to  1934,  however,  one 
earthquake  is  of  special  importance;  this  is  the  .so- 
called  Pico  Canyon  earthquake  of  1893  (Townley  and 
.\llen,  1939),  which  was  apparently  centered  only 
slightly  west  of  the  1971  epicenter  and  was  of  only 
slightly  lesser  magnitude.  It  does  indicate,  significantly, 
that  moderate  earthquakes  of  this  size  were  not  un- 
known in  the  region. 

Although  most  of  the  faults  of  the  San  Fernando 
area  had  not  been  generally  recognized  by  geologists 
and  seismologists  as  "active"  prior  to  1971,  abundant 
unpublished  evidence  indicated  that  some  were  active. 
Particularly  along  the  Tuiunga  segment  of  the  San 
Fernando  fault,  geologists  of  the  Metropolitan  Water 
District  had — long  before  the  earthquake — carefully

documented  the  thrusting  of  older  rocks  over  very 
young  gravels  (Proctor  et  al.,  1972  ),  along  the  same 
fault  which  broke  on  9  February.  On  the  other  hand, 
such  evidence  of  geologically  very  recent  displace- 
ments is  becoming  more  and  more  widespread  along 
many  faults  in  coastal  California,  and  there  was  no 
known  reason  to  have  picked  out  the  San  Fernando 
fault  more  than  many  others  as  being  a  particularly 
likcl\  candidate  for  an  earthquake  in  1971.  The  lesson 
is  clear:  until  we  gain  better  geologic  and  seismologic 
understanding  of  the  relative  activity  of  various  fault 
zones,  all  of  coastal  California  must  be  considered  to 
be  one  of  relativcl\'  high  earthquake  hazard. 

HYPOCENJRAL  LOCATIONS 

In  our  earlier  papers,  Allen  et  al.  (1971)  summa- 
rized the  scismological  data  of  the  first  3  weeks  based 
only  on  the  permanent  stations  of  the  Caitcch  network, 
while  Hanks  ct  al.  (1971)  located  much  more  pre- 
cisely a  number  of  aftershocks  during  a  particular 
18-hour  period  on  the  basis  of  Caltech  portable  sta- 
tions installeti  in  the  epicentral  region  within  a  few 
hours  of  the  main  shock.  In  this  paper,  we  attempt  to 
use  data  from  the  Caltech  portable  stations,  in  addi- 
tion to  those  of  several  other  agencies  (table  1,  fig- 
ure 1 )  to  establish  correction  factors  to  make  more 
effective  use  of  the  more-distant  permanent  stations 
that  were  the  only  source  of  seismic  information  dur- 
ing the  first  few  hours  when  the  great  bulk  of  after-

shock  activity  occurred  as  well  as  later  in  the  after- 
shock sequence  when  most  of  the  portable  stations 
had  been  removed.  For  the  purpose  of  presenting  a 
homogeneous  body  of  data,  only  shocks  of  magnitude 
4.0  and  greater  have  been  listed  in  table  2  and  por- 
trayed in  figure  2.  We  feel  that  this  listing  is  relatively 
complete  even  within  the  first  few  minutes  following 
the  main  shock,  for  which  we  relied  heavily  on  the 
low-gain  (4x,  l(X)x)  instruments  of  the  Pasadena 
network,  as  well  as  on  the  remarkable  6-minute-long 
accelerograph  record  from  Pacoima  Dam  (Trifunac 
and  Hudson,  1971). 

Twenty-two  aftershocks  of  magnitude  3.5  and 
greater  that  were  particularl\-  well  located  by  the 
portable  stations  were  used  to  establish  correction  fac- 
tors for  the  more-distant  permanent  stations.  In  gen- 
eral, the  portable  stations  that  were  used  included 
most  of  the  CIT  and  FAIL  stations  (table  1),  as  well 
as  the  three  USGS  indicated  stations  for  a  more  lim- 
ited number  of  shocks,  .'\lthough  the  more-distant 
stations  of  the  Caltech  network  (those  indicated  by 
an  asterisk  in  table  1)  were  not  used  in  the  precise 
locations,  time  residuals  at  these  stations  were  calcu- 
lated in  each  case,  and  the  average  travel-time  correc- 
tion factors  thus  obtained  for  these  and  the  other 
permanent  stations  are  as  follows:

In  addition,  correction  factors  were  applied  to  some 
of  the  portable  stations  in  the  southwestern  part  of 
the  aftershock  region,  where  considerable  thicknesses 
of  alluvium  and  sedimentary  rocks  are  locally  present, 
as  contrasted  to  the  basement  rocks  that  closely  un- 
derlie most  of  the  rest  of  the  area.  These  correction 
factors,  based  on  the  local  geology,  were:  BLA,  —.5; 
BRC,  -.3;  OMM,  -.3;  SUS,  -.2;  LTU,  -.2  sec. 
All  of  the  above  travel-time  correction  factors  were 
applied  to  a  computer-location  program  based  on  the 
three-layer  southern  California  crustal  model  of  Press 
(1960).  In  actualit\',  this  model  is  clearly  a  gross  over- 
simplification; in  their  explosion  calibration  of  the 
US  Geological  Survey  network  in  this  same  area, 
Wesson  and  Gibbs  (1971)  demonstrated  that  the  local 
geology  and  crustal  structure  are  very  complicated 
and  variable. 

One  effect  of  using  both  the  travel-time  correction 
factors  and  the  larger  number  of  close-in  stations  has 
been  to  assign  generally  shallower  hypocentral  depths 
than  those  obtained  earlier.  Thus,  for  example,  the 
hypocenter  of  the  main  shock  is  now  assigned  a  depth 
of  8.4  km  (table  2)  instead  of  the  earlier  13.0  km 
(Allen  et  al.,  1971),  although  the  effect  on  the  loca- 
tion of  the  epicenter  is  less  than  1  km. 

Hypocenters  obtained  in  this  study  have  been  di- 


vided into  three  categories  of  accuracy  (table  2),  de- 
pending on  the  number  and  location  of  stations  used 
in  the  solution  and  on  the  standard  error  of  the  com- 
puter solution.  We  feel  that  "A"-quality  locations  are 
generally  accurate  to  \\ithin  2  km  horizontalh-  and 
4  km  vertically.  "B"-quality  hypocenters  are  felt  to 
be  accurate  to  within  4  km  horizontally  and  8  km 
vertically;  and  "C"-quality  solutions  are  still  less  ac- 
curate. Those  hypocentrai  locations  in  the  vicinitv  of 
the  main  shock  probably  are  much  better  than  these 
standards,  and  the  depths  of  the  deeper  shocks  are 
more  accurately  determined  than  those  of  shallow 
focus.  The  figures  represent  somewhat  subjective  but 
conservative  judgments  based  on  attempts  at  location 
under  a  wide  variety-  of  assumptions,  as  well  as  on 
the  comparison  of  .some  of  our  solutions  with  the 
largely  independent  US  Geological  Survey  solutions 
based  on  explosion  calibration  (R.  Wesson,  personal 
communication). 

Because  of  the  difficulty  in  obtaining  hypocentral 
solutions  for  the  numerous  large  aftershocks  that  oc- 
curred within  the  first  10  minutes  following  the  main 
shock  (table  2),  it  is  dangerous  to  attempt  to  draw 
conclusions  about  possible  migrations  in  aftershock 
activity  with  time.  It  nevertheless  may  be  significant 
that  all  of  the  larger  aftershocks  that  we  have  located 
in  the  southwestern  extremity  of  the  aftershock  zone 
— near  Chatsworth  and  Granada  Hills  (figure  2) — 
occurred  relatively  late  in  the  aftershock  period.  The 
largest  flurry  of  activit\-  started  almost  2  months  after 
the  main  shock  and  included  the  shallow  magnitude

4.6  shock  of  31  March  tiiat  locally  caused  more  dam- 
age in  Granada  Hills  than  did  the  main  shock  itself 
(Barrows  et  al.,  this  volume). 

MAGNITUDES 

The  local  magnitude  (Mj,)  of  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  main  shock  was  tentatively  given  as  6.6 
b\'  Allen  et  al.  (1971)  and  Division  of  Geological  and 
Planetary  Sciences  (1971)  on  the  basis  of  initial  ex- 
amination of  the  low-gain  (4.\)  Wood- Anderson  NS 


seismogram  written  at  Pasadena.  Subsequently,  other 
low-gain  instrumental  records  of  the  Pasadena  net- 
work have  been  examined  in  detail,  and  we  herein 
update  our  original  estimate  of  Mi.  on  the  basis  of  rec- 
ords from  Riverside,  Cottonwood,  and  Santa  Barbara, 
in  addition  to  Pasadena.  .Ml  normal-magnification 
(2800)  Wood-Anderson  instruments  were  off-scale, 
such  as  those  at  Barrett  and  Tincmaha.  Resulting  mag- 
nitude assignments  from  the  various  low-gain  instru- 
ments are  as  follows:

The  Pasadena  determination  is  subject  to  the  addi- 
tional uncertainty  that  the  —log  Ao  correction  (Rich- 
ter,  19.58)  is  a  very  sensitive  function  of  distance  for 
epicentral  distances  of  less  than  50  km. 

On  the  basis  of  these  determinations,  we  assign 
M,.  =  6.4  to  the  San  Fernando  earthquake.  This  com- 
pares closely  to  the  mean  magnitude  of  6.48  assigned 
by  Bolt  and  Gopalakrishnan  (this  volume)  from  four 
stations  of  the  Berkeley  network.  The  PDE  listing  by 
the  National  Earthquake  Information  Center  of 
NOAA  is  Ms  =  6.2,  mh  =  6.5,  based  on  279  stations 
reporting. 

Magnitudes  have  been  assigned  to  aftershocks  (ta- 
ble 2)  on  the  basis  of  readings  from  eleven  standard 
Wood-Anderson  torsion  seismometers  at  six  widely 
spaced  stations  of  the  southern  California  network 
(Pasadena,  Barrett,  Cottonwood,  Riverside,  Santa  Bar- 
bara, Tinemaha).  .Most  magnitudes  have  been  deter- 
mined b&gt;'  averaging  the  readings  from  at  least  five  of 
these  stations.  It  is  significant,  however,  that  the  av- 
erage standard  deviation  for  individual  station  read- 
ings for  20  aftershocks  of  magnitude  4.0  and  greater, 
each  recorded  at  five  or  more  stations,  was  0.30.  Con- 
sidering this  large  variation  observed  on  standard  in- 
struments in  a  wide  variety  of  azimuths  from  the  epi- 
center, some  of  the  discrepancies  between  Caltech  and 
Berkeley  magnitudes  reported  by  Bolt  and  Gopala- 
krishnan (this  volume)  are  not  surprising. 

FOCAL  MECHANISMS  AND 
TECTONIC  INTERPRETATIONS 

Fault-plane  .solutions  for  the  main  shock  have 
been  carried  out  independentlx-  by  several  investiga- 
tors (Canitez  and  Toksoz,  in  press;  Dillinger  and  Es- 
pinosa,  1971;  Wesson  et  al.,  1971;  Whitcomb,  1971a), 
and  they  agree  that  the  basic  mechanism  of  initial 
faulting  was  that  of  a  thrust  striking  about  N  70°  W, 
dipping  about  50°  NE,  and  including  a  significant 
component  of  left-lateral  slip  in  addition  to  the  thrust 
component.  This  agrees  remarkabl\-  well  with  the 
surface  obser\ations  of  faulting  in  the  Sylmar-San 
Fernando  area,  some  13  km  farther  south.  Kamb  et  al. 
(1971),  for  example,  report  the  overall  trend  of  the 
surficiai  fault  break  to  be  N  72°  W  with  north  dips 
averaging  about  42°;  they  also  report  "nearly  equal 
amounts  of  north-south   compression,   vertical   uplift

(north  side  up),  and  left-lateral  slip." 

The  hypocentral  locations  of  the  main  shock  and 
aftershocks  presented  herein  support  the  idea  of  dis- 
placement on  a  north-dipping  thrust  fault,  and  it 
seems  particularly  likel\-  that  the  lunate  distribution 
of  aftershock  epicenters  (figures  2,  3;  Allen  et  al., 
1971;  Hanks  ct  nl.,  1971;  Wesson  et  al.,  1971)  reflects 
the  edge  of  the  disc-shaped  segment  of  the  fault  plane 
that  slipped  during  the  earthquake,  \\here  stresses  re- 
mained high  following  the  main  shock.  Very  few 
aftershocks  occurred  in  the  vicinity  of  the  surface 
break,  presumably  because  stresses  were  completely 
relieved  there.  Two  principal  areas  of  interest  remain: 
(1)  aftershocks  near  Granada  Hills  and  Chatswoith, 
at  the  southwest  end  of  the  aftershock  zone  (fig- 
ure 2),  are  south  of  the  projected  trace  of  the  thrust 
fault  and  therefore  do  not  fit  so  simple  a  picture  of 
thrusting;  and  (2)  focal-mechanism  studies  of  after- 
shocks (Whitcomb,  1971a,  1971b)  include  many 
shocks  of  strike-slip  character  that  demand  an  explan- 
ation more  complicated  than  that  of  a  simple  thrust 
surface. 

Disregarding  momentarily  tiiose  aftershocks  near 
Granada  Hills  and  Chatsworth,  it  is  clear  from  fig- 
ure 4  that  riic  a\crage  dip  of  the  zone  of  faulting 
north  from  the  fault  trace  is  considerabh'  less  than 
the  .'&gt;0°  dip  indicated  by  the  focal  mechanism  of  the 
main  shock.  One  might  explain  this  by  systematic  er- 
rors in  the  depth  assignment  of  the  hypocenters 
shown  in  figure  4,  but  substantiating  evidence  of  the

relatively  shallow  dip  of  the  fault  zone  is  given  by 
the  motion  vectors  of  individual  focal-mechanism  so- 
lutions. For  some  65  aftershocks,  the  motion  vectors 
closely  concentrate  around  an  average  plunge  of  36° 
toward  N  20°  E,  which  corresponds  closely  to  the 
dip  of  the  hypothetical  fault  surface  passing  through 
the  hypocenter  of  the  main  shock  and  the  main  con- 
centration of  aftershock  hypocenters  (figure  4).  We 
prefer  to  believe,  therefore,  that  the  steep  dip  of  the 
fault  plane  portrayed  by  the  focal  mechanism  of  the 
main  shock  represents  only  the  very  initial  motion, 
and  that  the  fault  displacement  then  propagated  to 
the  surface  along  a  zone  dipping  some  15°  less  steeply. 
The  focal-mechanism  data  on  which  this  and  the  fol- 
lowing arguments  are  based  will  be  presented  in  detail 
in  a  separate  paper  by  Whitcomb;  the  principal  ideas 
have  already  been  presented  in  Whitcomb,  1971a  and 
1971b. 

It  is  clear  from  figure  3  that  the  aftershocks  of 
dominanti)'  strike-slip  character  delineate  a  relatively 
\\  ell-defined  north-trending  zone  west  of  the  epicen- 
ter of  the  main  shock.  If  the  solutions  portrayed  right- 
lateral  slip,  this  zone  might  be  visualized  as  a  typical 
tear  fault  (Hills,  1963)  extending  toward  the  ground 
surface,  but  their  consistent  portrayal  of  left-lateral 
slip  demands  instead  that  the  thrust  surface  turn 
doii-ii-iiwd  along  this  zone.  These  strike-slip  earth- 
quakes topically  occur  on  fault  surfaces  dipping 
steeph-  w  estward,  and  we  thus  visualize  a  linear,  steep 
flexure  in  the  fault  surface  along  this  zone  (figure  5). 
Under  this  hypothesis,  most  of  the  strike-slip  after- 
shocks should  be  deeper  than  the  thrust  aftershocks 
to  the  east,  and  this  is  permitted  but  not  demanded 
by  the  data  of  figure  4.  It  is  significant,  however,  that 
all  but  one  of  the  few  thrust-type  aftershocks  deeper 
than  the  main  shock  (figure  4)  occur  \\ithin  and  west 
of  the  flexural  zone,  suggesting  that  the  flexure  is  in 
essence  a  north-plunging,  steep-flanked  monocline 
that  simply  steps  down  the  thrust  plane  to  a  some- 
what greater  depth  west  of  the  flexure,  perhaps  bv 
3-5  km.

Figure  5.  Schematic  structural  contour  mop  showing  simplifieci  con- 
tours, in  kilometers,  on  fault  plane  and  showing  monoctinol  flexure 
that  might  exploin  strike-slip  aftershock  mechanisms  on  steep  west- 
dipping  flank  of  flexure  in  fault  surface. 


If  indeed  a  flexure  exists  along  the  zone  of  strike- 
slip  aftershocks,  one  geometric  effect  would  be  to  dis- 
place the  trace  of  the  thrust  fault  to  the  south  on  the 
\\'est  side  of  the  flexure  (figure  5),  and  this  may  be 
the  explanation  of  the  aftershocks  near  Granada  Hills 
and  Chatsworth  that  are  south  of  the  trace  of  the 
fault  as  projected  westward  from  the  Svlmar  and 
Tujunga  segments.  Furthermore,  their  predominant 
thrust-type  focal  mechanisms  are  consistent  with  their 
being  west  of  the  flexure,  in  analogy  to  those  thrust- 
t&gt;pc  aftershocks  at  the  very  northwest  corner  of  the 
aftershock  area  (figure  3).  It  is  also  significant  that 
all  of  the  thrust-type  aftershocks  west  of  the  flexure 
.seem  to  have  occurred  well  after  the  initiation  of 
aftershock  activity,  on  or  after  1  I  Februar\-;  the  larger 
shocks  in  the  Chatsw  orth-Granada  Hills  area  (fig- 
ure 2)  all  occurred  after  30  March  \cr\'  late  in  the 
aftershock  period. 

Further  support  for  the  existence  of  a  north-trend- 
ing flexure  comes  from  the  mapped  geolog\-  of  the 
area  (Went worth  and  Yerkes,  1971,  figure  2).  The 
trace  of  the  Santa  Susana  thrust,  which  lies  parallel  to 


and  some  4  km  north  of  the  San  Fernando  fault,  makes 
a  distinct  bend  north  of  Granada  Hills  in  exactly  the 
manner  postulated  for  the  San  Fernando  fault  (fig- 
ure 5).  Furthermore,  the  fact  that  basement  rocks  are 
widel\-  exposed  in  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  east 
of  this  zone,  whereas  only  younger  sedimentary  rocks 
are  exposed  to  the  west,  strongly  supports  the  con- 
cept of  a  flexural  down-step  to  the  west  in  this  area. 
Thus  we  argue  that  the  San  Fernando  earthquake 
was  caused  by  displacement  on  a  thrust  fault  or  zone 
of  thrust  faults  dipping  about  35'  north  and  striking 
about  N  70°  W.  Particularly  where  the  fault  trace 
trended  more  westerh',  as  along  the  S&gt;lmar  segment, 
significant  left-lateral  slip  occurred.  .\  steep  flexure 
in  the  thrust-fault  surface,  parallel  to  (and  probably 
controlling)  the  direction  of  slip  and  down-stepped 
to  the  w  est,  tended  to  limit  the  zone  of  initial  breaking 
on  the  west  and  led  to  numerous  aftershocks  of  left- 
lateral  strike-slip  character  on  the  steep  west-dipping 
flank  of  the  flexure.  Some  thrust  displacement  oc- 
curred later  on  the  down-stepped  segment  of  the 
thrust  fault  west  of  the  flexure,  as  indicated  by  after- 
shocks in  the  Chatsworth-Granada  Hills  area  and  in 
the  northwestern  extremity  of  the  aftershock  zone 
north  of  Solemint.  Whitcomb  (1971a;  1971b)  has 
pointed  out  that  many  of  the  aftershocks  east  of  the 
main  epicenter  have  fault-plane  solutions  which  are 
consistent  with  normal  faulting  along  steep  northwest- 
trending  faults;  for  simplicit\-,  such  shocks  have  not 
been  shown  on  figures  3  and  4,  but  these  events  agree 
with  the  concept  of  compressional  release  resulting 
from  a  southward  thrust  toward  the  San  Fernando 
Valley.

Magnitudes,  Aftershocks,  and  Fault  Dynamics^ 

by  Bruce  A.  Bolt^  and  B.  S.  Gopalakrishnan^ 


MAGNITUDE  OF  THE  MAIN  SHOCK 
The  principal  shock  occurred  at  14h  00m  41.6s 
(GMT)  near  latitude  34°  24.0'  N  and  longitude  118° 
23.7'  W.  The  focal  depth  was  calculated  to  be  13  km 
(hypocenter  determination  by  Allen  et  al.,  1971).  A 
later  computation  by  Allen  et  al.  (1972)  gives  a  depth 
of  8.4  ±  4  km.  Because  of  the  size  and  proximity  of 
the  main  shock,  the  Richter  magnitude  could  not  be 
assessed  directly  by  the  California  Institute  of  Tech- 
nology network  of  Wood-Anderson  seismographs. 
The  readings  of  the  Wood-Anderson  seismographs  of 
the  Berkeley  network  are  given  in  table  1.  In  previous 
work,  small  additive  adjustments  were  derived  empiri- 
cally to  make  California  Institute  of  Technology  and 
Berkeley  magnitudes  agree  numerically.  These  adjust- 
ments, shown  in  table  1,  were  applied.

The  resulting  mean  Richter  magnitude  is  6.48  ±  0.15. 
The  magnitude  calculated  by  Allen  et  al.  (1972)  from

work is  6.4. 

UST  OF  AFTERSHOCKS 

The  short-period  seismographs  of  the  Berkeley  te- 
lemetry network  are  sensitive  enough  to  detect  all  the 
aftershocks  in  the  San  Fernando  Valley  region  down 
to  magnitude  2.8.  The  most  sensitive  are  the  vertical 
Benioff  seismographs  at  Priest  (A  =  282.8  km)  and 
Jamestown  (A  =  434.4  km);  the  Wood-Anderson  seis- 
mographs at  Mt.  Hamilton  and  Berkeley  yield  a  com- 
plete set  of  aftershocks  only  down  to  magnitude  4.0.

It  should  be  pointed  out  that  there  is  not  always  an 
agreement  betsveen  the  magnitudes  given  in  table  2 
and  those  of  Allen  et  al.  (1971)  given  in  the  last  col- 
umn of  the  table.  Some  earthquakes  assessed  at  Ml  ^ 
4.0  at  California  Institute  of  Technology  were  re- 
corded with  smaller  magnitudes  at  Berkeley  and 
Mount  Hamilton.  The  greatest  discrepancy  is  for  the 
earthquake  of  February  21,  1971,  (Origin  time  02:42: 
17  GMT)  for  which  the  Berkeley  magnitude  is  4.2

Aftershocks  in  the  list  in  table  2  began  about  10 
minutes  after  the  main  shock.  Prior  to  14h  lOm,  the 
records  of  the  seismometers  were  too  disturbed  to 
allow  separation  of  events.  Fortunately,  the  Pacoima 
strong-motion  accelerometer  continued  to  record  for 
about  7  minutes  after  being  triggered  by  the  main 
shock  (Maley  and  Cloud,  1971),  making  it  possible  to 
study  the  aftershocks  in  the  first  7  minutes  following 
the  main  shock.  Table  3  lists  these  aftershocks.  The 
magnitudes  \\ere  computed  by  taking  the  magnitude 
of  the  main  shock  (not  listed  in  table  3)  to  be  6.5  and 
comparing  the  peak  vertical  amplitudes  of  each  after- 
shock with  the  peak  vertical  amplitude  of  the  main 
shock.

A  copy  of  the  three-component  accelerogram  for 
the  aftershock  at  14h  02m  48s  is  given  in  figure  1.  This 
accelerogram  is  typical  of  many  of  the  aftershocks. 
The  interval  between  the  high-frequency  onset  (15 
Hz.)  and  the  longer  pulse-like  packet  (0.8  Hz.)  is  1.7 
seconds.  This  time  difference  is  appropriate  for  a 
P-wave  onset  followed  by  an  S-wave  packet  from  a 
focus  at  a  depth  of  about  1 3  km,  along  the  fault  plane 


under  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  (see  figure  5).  This 
interpretation  is  supported  by  the  much  smaller  ampli- 
tude of  the  second  packet  (S  waves)  on  the  vertical 
component  of  ground  acceleration  (central  trace  in 
figure  1)  compared  with  the  same  onset  on  the  hori- 
zontal components. 

Figure  2  shows  a  plot  of  the  logarithm  of  the  num- 
ber (N)  of  earthquakes  in  this  sequence  (given  in 
table  2)  with  magnitude  greater  than  or  equal  to  M 
(for  M  ^  4.0).  We  can  represent  the  relationship  be- 
tween log  N  and  magnitude  by  a  straight  line  with 
the  equation  log  N  =  a  —  bM  where  a  and  b  are  con- 
stants. Then  from  figure  2,  by  least  squares,  b  =  0.64, 
if  the  main  shock  is  included  and  1.01  if  the  main  shock 
is  e.xcluded.  When  the  35  aftershocks  immediately  fol- 
lowing the  main  shock  listed  in  table  3  are  added,  the 
corresponding  b  values  become  0.78  and  1.16,  respec- 
tively. The  difference  may  be  marginally  significant. 

The  mean  value  of  'b'  for  all  southern  California 
earthquakes  from  1934  to  1963  was  found  to  be  0.86 
(Allen  et  al.,  1965).  Aftershock  sequences  were  in- 
cluded in  the  study.  These  workers  found  a  'b'  value 
of  1.01  for  the  Los  Angeles  Basin.  The  'b'  value  for 
aftershock  sequences  is  usually  less  than  that  for  over- 
all seismicity.  Udias  (1965)  obtained  a  value  of  0.49 
for  the  Salinas- Watsonville  sequence  of  August  31, 
1963,  and  0.41  for  the  sequence  of  September  14,  1963.

least  squares  fit  with  the  main  shock  included.  The  dashed  line  is  the 
fit  with  the  main  shock  excluded.

Figure  3.      Plot  of  occurrence  (M  vs.  time)  of  aftershocks.  The  magnitude  cutoff  is  4.0. 


McFa-IIIv  ct  al.  (1967)  got  a  value  of  0.63  for  the  Park- 
field  sequence  of  1966  (main  shock  included  in  the 
three  cases). 

Lomnitz  (1966)  pointed  out  that,  in  an  aftershock 
sequence,  the  earthquakes  are  stable  about  the  mean, 
hut  the  \ariance  of  magnitude  tends  to  be  correlated 
with  the  rate  of  occurrence  of  events;  that  is,  there  is 
a  w  ider  scatter  of  magnitudes  at  the  beginning  of  the 
sequence  than  towards  the  end.  In  this  case,  a  plot  of 
M  vs.  time  for  M  ^  4.0  is  consistent  with  the  stability 
of  the  mean  (figure  3). 

Figure  4  is  the  cumulative  plot  of  the  occurrence  of 
aftershocks.  The  magnitude  cut-off  for  these  data  was 
2.8.  The  plot  indicates  that  it  would  be  October  1971 
before  the  scismicity  returns  to  normal,  taken  as  three 
cartiiquakes  per  month  with  M  ^  2.8. 

ENERGY  AND  SIRMN  RELEASE

Assume  log  F  =  9.9 -f-  1.9iM,.  —  .024Mr.  The  seis- 
mic energy  released  by  the  main  shock  is  then  1.7  x  10-' 
ergs.  The  total  energy  released  by  the  aftershocks 
(M  ^  4)  is  4.9  X  10'"  ergs.  From  strain  theorv,

where  V  is  the  volume  of  the  rock  where  the  energy 
is  stored,  f  is  the  average  elastic  strain,  and  |i  is  the 


modulus  of  rigidity.  Benioff  (1965)  assumed  for  the 

Kern  County  sequence  of  1952  that  the  surface  area  of 

the  strain  zone  was  defined  by  the  area  covered  by  the 

epicenters  of  the  aftershocks  and  tiiat  the  depth  of  the 

strain  zone  was   .35  km.,  the  thickness  of  the  crust. 

Here,  \vc  assumed  that  the  depth  of  the  strained  zone 

associated  \\ith  the  seismic  activity  was  the  depth  of 

the  deepest  earthquake  of  the  sequence.  Wesson  ct  al. 

(1971)  have  located  the  aftershocks.  The  surface  area 

covered  b\'  the  aftershocks  is  about  600  sq.  km.  and 

the  deepest  aftershock  occurred  at  a  depth  of  about

74°  W,  vertical  and  S  16°  E)  were  resolved  into  the 
resultant  motions  in  the  direction  of  the  strike  of  the 
fault  (T),  in  the  downdip  direction  of  the  fault  (L), 
and  along  the  normal  (N)  to  the  fault  plane.  The 
strike  of  the  fault  plane  was  taken  to  be  N  72°  W  and 
the  dip  55°. 

The  resolution  was  done  as  follows.  The  digital  card 
deck  of  the  original  records,  sampled  at  intervals  of 
.02  second,  was  converted  to  continuous  analog  signal 
on  magnetic  tape,  using  an  IBM  1800  computer  and  a 
special  program.  The  analog  signals  were  then  com- 
bined using  an  analog  computer  to  obtain  the  three 
resultants  T,L,N.  The  resolved  accelerograms  are  re- 
produced in  figure  6. 

The  aim  of  this  vectorial  resolution  was  to  disen- 
tangle the  recorded  motion,  taking  the  mechanism  of 
rupture  into  account. 

The  transverse  component  T,  on  the  simple  model 
of  predominantly  thrust  faulting  (figure  5),  should  be 
relatively  small  and  composed  mainly  of  Love,  surface 
shear,  wave  motion.  In  fact,  figure  6  shows  that  the 
amplitudes  of  the  first  5  seconds  of  the  T  record  are 
significantly  less  than  those  of  the  L  and  N  records. 
Further,  the  large,  relatively  long-period  pulse  (marked 
Si)  about  1  second  after  the  begmning  of  L  and  N  is 
not  strong  in  T.  (Some  left-lateral  fault  displacement 
was  observed  along  the  fault  rupture.) 

On  the  resolved  traces,  the  maximum  acceleration 
was  0.8  g  for  L  and  1.1  g  for  N.  This  large  acceleration 
in  the  direction  normal  to  the  fault  plane  can  be  ex- 


plained on  the  basis  of  a  double-couple  source  mech- 
anism (figure  5).  When  the  fault  breaks  at  the  focus 
F,  in  addition  to  the  sudden  fling  parallel  to  the  fault 
plane,  this  mechanism  demands  a  comparable  strong 
displacement  along  a  plane  normal  to  the  fault  plane. 
A  similar  effect  was  seen  on  the  Cholame  accelerogram 
(on  the  component  normal  to  the  San  Andreas  fault) 
for  the  1966  Parkfield  earthquake  (see  Bolt,  1970). 

We  have  made  an  attempt  to  explain  some  of  the 
phases  on  the  resolved  accelerograms  on  the  basis  of 
a  moving  rupture  and  seismic  wave  theory  applied  to 
a  homogeneous  elastic  half-space  (figure  5).  Even 
though  the  interpretation  is  oversimplified  and  specu- 
lative because  the  geologic  structure  near  the  source 
and  the  detailed  dynamics  of  the  rupture  are  not  in- 
corporated, the  principal  effects  should  be  accounted 
for. 

We  assumed  that  the  accelerometer  at  Pacoima  was 
triggered  by  the  direct  P  arrival  from  the  focus  of  the 
main  shock  or  within  about  a  half  second  of  it.  Sup- 
port for  this  comes  from  the  following  observations: 
1)  The  first  wave  packet  of  the  aftershocks  which 
continued  to  be  recorded  on  the  Pacoima  record  ap- 
peared very  similar  in  character  to  the  early  wave 
pattern  of  the  main  shock.  2)  The  interval  between 
the  first  wave  arrival  and  the  larger  amplitude  long- 
period  arrivals  (near  Si  in  figure  6)  was  about  1.7 
seconds  for  both  the  main  shock  and  the  aftershocks. 

Assume  that  the  dislocation  moved  from  F  to  T 
(figure  5)  with  a  velocity  of  2.5  km/sec  along  the  fault

nnd  that  F  and  S  waves  were  generated  at  eacli  point 
of  this  moving  source.  Let  the  average  crustal  P  ve- 
locity he  5.5  km/sec  and  the  S  velocity  he  3.3  km/sec. 
Then  the  first  S  phase  (direct  ray  path)  should  arrive 
at  Pacoima  ahout  1.7  seconds  after  the  first  P.  This 
theoretical  arrival  is  marked  S,  in  figure  6;  it  coincides 
with  the  beginning  of  the  long-period  phase  on  the 
accelogram.  A\'c  thus  interpret  the  beginning  of  the 
long-period  motion  as  the  arrival  of  the  first  shear 
wave  by  a  direct  path  from  the  focus. 

This  inference  is  supported  t)\-  the  rclativcl\'  long- 
period  of  the  phase  (1.2  seconds).  It  is  hardly  present 
on  the  T  component,  whereas  it  is  pronounced  on  the 
L  and  N  components.  This  suggests  that  the  motion 


is  of  the  S\'  type  (vcrticalK'  polarized  shear  waves). 
S^  marked  the  theoretical  arrival  time  of  the  SV-pulsc 
from  the  dislocation  source  as  it  moved  through  the 
point  on  the  fault  (A  in  figure  5)  nearest  to  Pacoima 
at  a  rupture  velocity  of  2.5  km/sec.  By  this  time,  the 
1.2-sccond  period  acceleration  pulse  on  the  record  was 
about  complete.  The  ground  displacement  has  been 
computed  by  a  double  integration  of  the  Pacoima  ac- 
celerogram by  Trifunac  and  Hudson  (1971).  This 
showed  that  the  ground  at  Pacoima  has  been  displaced 
1)\-  some  tens  of  cms  when  So  arrives.  R  is  the  theo- 
retical arrival  time  of  the  first  Rayleigh  surface  wave, 
through  basement  rock,  generated  at  the  point  T  where 
tiic  rupture  reaches  the  surface.  Because  the  distances

l)Ct\vccii  Pacoiina  and  the  primary  wave  sources  arc 
small,  it  is  doubtful,  theoretically,  whether  Rayleigh 
waves  could  contrilnite  significantly  to  the  Pacoima 
shaking. 

The  simple  two-dimensional  model  of  the  source 
and  the  crust  (without  ver\'  low  velocit\-  surficial 
layers)  adopted  above  appears  able  to  explain  the  main 
features  of  the  first  third  of  the  observed  accelerogram. 
The  remaining  part  of  the  record,  which  contains 
large-amplitude  higii-frequency  motion,  is  still  unac- 
counted for. 

Three  explanations  for  the  major  part  of  the  later 
shaking  might  be  suggested.  First,  displacement  of  the 
fault  in  several  stages.  Because  there  is  only  one  major 
step  on  the  Pacoima  displacement  record,  this  alterna- 
tive is  unlikely.  Secondl\-,  trapped  seismic  wave  propa- 
gation in  surficial  Iow-velocit\-  material,  with  scatter- 
ing, dispersion  and  mode  interference.  The  strongest 
high-frequency  accelerations  in  the  last  half  of  the 
record  would  then  he  associated  with  waves  traveling 
as  slowly  as  a  few  thousand  feet  per  second.  These 
waves  would  be  similar  to  "ground-roll."  However, 
the  Pacoima  site  is  on  the  crystalline  rocks  of  the  San 
Gabriel  mountains  \\  hich  have  much  higher  transmis- 
sion velocities.  Further,  this  mechanism  entails  heavy 
attenuation  of  high  frequencies,  contrary  to  the  waves 
observed. 

The  third  explanation  depends  on  the  three-dimen- 
sional nature  of  the  fault  model  (Bolt,  1972).  Rupture, 
no  doubt,  also  spread  horizontally  from  the  focus  on 
the  dipping  fault  plane.  Fault  rupture  extending  15  km 


along  the  strike  from  F  in  figure  5  would  reach  its 
horizontal  extremity  in  15/2.5  =  6  sees,  and  the  sur- 
face (east  of  Tujunga  Canyon)  in  about  30/2.5  =  12 
sees.  During  this  dislocation,  high-frequency  S  waves 
would  radiate  outwards  through  the  cr\stalline  rock  to 
Pacoima  with  a  speed  of  3.3  km/sec.  In  this  way,  high- 
frequency  little-attenuated  waves  could  continue  to  ar- 
rive at  Pacomia  for  14  sec  after  P. 

Suppose  the  fling,  'v,'  along  tiie  fault  behaves  like  a 
damped   elastic   oscillator,   with   amplitude   given  by 

v  =  D(l  -|-nt)e-"V2, 
where  D  is  the  total  fault  offset  and  n  is  the  damping 
constant.  Then  tiic  absolute  maximum  acceleration  is 
n-  D/2  initially.  From  figure  6,  the  pulse  width  is  about 
1.2  seconds,  so  that  n  «  1.7.  From  the  field  measure- 
ments, D  =«  2  meters.  Thus,  the  predicted  peak  accel- 
eration of  the  SV  pulse  is  about  0.3  g.  The  measured 
acceleration  of  the  1.2  second  pulse  (between  Si  and 
S2)  from  the  N  component  of  figure  6  is  about  0.5  g, 
in  reasonable  agreement.

Strong  Motion  Data  from  the 
San  Fernando,  California,  Earthquake  of  February  9,  197V 


by  William  K.  Cloud  ^  and  Donald  L  Hudson  ' 


The  San  Fernando,  California,  earthquake  of 
February  9,  1971,  occurred  virtually  at  the  center  of 
the  largest  concentration  of  strong-motion  recording 
instruments  in  the  United  States  cooperative  network 
(see  Table  1 ).  As  a  result,  an  unprecedented  amount  of 
valuable  data  on  strong  ground  and  building  motion

cording  program.  The  benefit  to  earthquake  engi- 
neering that  eventually  will  be  derived  from  applica- 
tion of  these  data  will  be  a  highly  rewarding  payoff 
for  a  long-range  and  patient  investment  in  engineering 
seismology  by  the  Seismological  Field  Survey  unit  of 
NOAA's  Environmental  Research  Laboratories,  in 
cooperation  with  numerous  institutes,  organizations, 
and  individuals. 

The  beginning  of  the  program  in  engineering  seis- 
mology dates  back  to  the  early  1930s  when  the  Coast 
and  Geodetic  Sun'ey  designed  the  first  strong-motion 
seismographs  and,  with  the  cooperation  of  engineers, 
installed  a  small  network  of  these  instruments  in  Cali- 
fornia (Cloud,  1964).  Responsibility  for  the  nervvork 
was  assigned  to  the  Seismological  Field  Survey,  a 
newly  formed  unit  of  the  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey 
with  headquarters  in  San  Francisco.* 

Under  supervision  of  the  Seismological  Field  Sur- 
vey, the  network  was  gradually  expanded  but  re- 
mained small  until  commercially  developed  strong- 
motion  accelerographs  became  available  in  the  early 
1960s.  Prior  to  this  time,  only  custom-built  instruments 
originally  designed  by  the  Survey  could  be  obtained 
in  limited  numbers.  Introduction  of  commercially 
available  strong-motion  accelerographs  at  a  modest 
cost  plus  the  introduction  of  simplified  seismoscopes 
acted  as  a  stimulus  to  growth  of  the  network.  A  fur- 
ther factor  in  the  growth  of  the  netw  ork  was  agree- 
ment by  the  Coast  and  Geodetic  Surve&gt;'  to  accept 
privately  owned  instruments  into  the  network  for 
maintenance. 

The  availabilit\-  of  modern  instruments  and  Seis- 
mological Field  Survey  supervision  encouraged  organ- 
izations such  as  the  California  Institute  of  Technology, 
California  Department  of  Water  Resources,  U.S.  Bu- 
reau of  Reclamation  and  the  U.S.  Corps  of  Engineers 
to  increase  greatly  their  involvement  in  the  program. 
Also,  individual  building  owners,  subject  to  provisions 
of  local  building  codes,  found  the  situation  to  their  ad- 
vantage. This  was  especially  true  in  southern  Califor- 
nia where  Los  Angeles  and  Beverly  Hills,  in  1965,  were 
the  first  cities  in  the  United  States  to  pass  a  non-retro- 
active ordinance  requiring  building  owners  to  install 
three  accelerographs  in  buildings  of  more  than  six- 
stories.  The  requirement  and  its  later  inclusion  in  the 
appendix  of  the  Uniform  Building  Code  was  a  major 


*  As  a  result  of  recent  governmental  reorganization,  the  Seis- 
mological Field  Survey  is  now  a  unit  of  the  National 
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration's  Environmental 
Research  Laboratories.

reason  for  over  half  of  the  accelerographs  in  the  net- 
work being  concentrated  in  the  area  affected  by  the 
San  Fernando  earthqualce. 

Considering  the  concentration  of  instruments 
(over  200  accelerographs  and  140  seismoscopes),  it 
was  a  fortunate  circumstance  that  prior  to  the  earth- 
quake the  Seismological  Field  Survey  ERL,  NOAA, 
and  the  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  Laboratory, 
California  Institute  of  Technology,  had  cooperated 
closely  for  years  on  the  engineering  seismology  pro- 
gram and  had  worked  as  a  team  on  previous  earth- 
quakes. The  combined  expertise  of  the  two  organiza- 
tions provided  an  immediately  available,  on-site  means 
of  handling  the  large  amount  of  strong-motion  data 
resulting  from  the  earthquake.  Efforts  of  the  Seismo- 
logical Field  Survey  were  directed  primarily  toward: 

(a)  Collecting,  developing,  and  labeling  records; 

(b)  Servicing  of  instruments; 

(c)  Making  preliminary  determinations  of  maxi- 
mum accelerations; 

(d)  Processing    and    analyzing    of    seismoscope 
records; 

(e)  Distributing     and     collecting     questionnaire 
cards  to  determine  intensity. 


While  efforts  of  the  Earthquake  Engineering  Research 
Laboratory  were  directed  primarily  toward: 

(a)  Production  of  accurate  archival  copies  of  all 
accelerograms  as  well  as  copies  suitable  for 
digitization  and  data  processing; 

(b)  Production  of  multiple  copies  suitable  for 
immediate  display  and  distribution  to  all  in- 
terested parties; 

(c)  Accurate  digitization  of  all  useable  records 
compatible  with  past  accelerogram  analysis; 

(d)  Presentation  of  all  accelerograms  in  a  stand- 
ard form,  and  preparation  of  corrected  accel- 
erograph  data,  integrated  velocity  and  dis- 
placement curves,  and  various  spectra. 

INTENSITY  DISTRIBUTION 
Results  obtained  from  an  over  2000  questionnaire 
card  canvass  by  the  Seismological  Field  Surve\-  sup- 
plemented by  reports  of  field  investigators  indicate 
that  the  main  shock  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake 
was  felt  over  appro\imatel\-  80,000  square  miles  of 
California,  Nevada,  and  Arizona.  A  preliminar\-  draft 
of  intensit\-  distribution  prepared  by  Airs.  Nina  Scott 
of  the  Seismological  Field  Survey  is  shown  in  figure  1.

A'laximum  intensity  VIII  to  XI  on  the  Modified  Mer- 
calli  Scale  of  1931  was  assigned  to  the  most  affected 
area,  the  larger  value  to  reflect  spotty  catastrophic 
damage  such  as  occurred  to  the  Olive  View  and  other 
hospitals,  to  the  Sylmnr  Converter  Station,  to  freeway 
structures,  and  to  reflect  damaging  surface  ruptures. 

STRONG-MOTION  ACCELEROGRAPH  RECORDS 

Two  hundred  and  forty-one  accelerograms  were 
recorded  during  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  in  the 
southern  California  region,  making  this  earthquake  b&gt;' 
far  the  best-recorded  event  in  the  brief  histor\'  of 
strong-motion  seismology.  When  it  is  considered  that 
many  important  earthquakes  of  recent  times,  such  as 
the  great  Alaskan  earthquake  of  1964,  did  not  result 
in  even  one  record  of  strong  ground  motion,  the 
unique  value  of  this  unusual  wealth  of  data  will  be- 
come obvious. 

The  maps  of  figures  2,  3,  and  4  show  in  succes- 
sively greater  detail  the  location  of  the  accelerograph 
stations  in  the  area.  At  each  station,  the  number  indi- 


cates the  approximate  value  of  the  peak  ground  level 
acceleration  recorded  at  that  site. 

A  more  detailed  indication  of  the  peak  accelera- 
tion results,  along  with  details  of  the  station,  will  be 
found  in  table  II,  which  arranges  the  stations  in  order 
of  their  distance  from  the  epicenter.  In  this  table,  only 
those  stations  out  to  a  distance  of  some  60  km  have 
been  included,  since  the  more  distant  stations  have  in 
general  progressively  smaller  motions.  Complete  data 
for  all  stations  will  be  found  in  Hudson,  1971. 

About  175  of  the  accclerographs  were  located  in 
large  buildings  in  Los  Angeles  as  the  result  of  an 
amendment  to  the  building  code  in  1965,  which  re- 
quired three  strong-motion  accclerographs  in  all  new 
buildings  over  si.\  stories  in  height,  .\bout  30  accclero- 
graphs were  on  dams  and  other  h\draulic  structures, 
and  an  additional  30-40  stations  were  ground  stations, 
many  located  along  faults  or  in  arrays  across  the  San 
Andreas  fault. 

Representative  records  from  three  ground  sites 
are  shown  in  figures  5,  6,  and  7.  A  set  of  three  accel- 
erograms from  the  nearest  instrumented  tall  building 
to  the  epicenter  (20  km)  is  shown  in  figure  8.

Figure  7.     AR-240  occelerograph  record  from  crest  of  Santo  Felicia  Dam,  33  km  from  epicenter. 


MAXIMUM  ACCELERATION 

Included  among  the  records  obtained  was  the 
notable  accelerogram  from  Pacoima  Dam,  located  vir- 
tually at  the  center  of  the  epicentral  region,  as  shown 
in  figure  9.  This  record,  one  horizontal  component  of 
which  is  shown  in  computer  plotted  form  in  figure  10, 
showed  relatively  high-frequency  peak  accelerations 
as  large  as  1.25  gm.  These  peak  values  are  larger  by  a 
factor  of  two  than  measured  before  during  an  earth- 
quake. It  must  be  kept  in  mind,  however,  that  peak 
acceleration  values  alone  do  not  correlate  with  dam- 
age to  structures  and  that  duration  and  frequency  con- 
tent are  also  important  factors.  Although  the  accelero- 
gram recorded  at  Pacoima  Dam  is  undoubtedl\'  that 
of  very  strong  ground  motion,  it  is  for  some  structures 
not  the  most  destructive  type  of  motion  that  has  been 
measured  (Housner,  1970). 

Because  of  the  importance  of  the  Pacoima  Dam 
record  and  of  the  rather  special  conditions  at  the  site, 
a  brief  description  of  the  installation  will  be  given 
(Trifunac  and  Hudson,  1971):  The  accelerograph  is 
mounted  on  a  concrete  foundation  firmly  attached  to 
a  small  gneissic  granitic  ridge  adjacent  to  and  above 
one  abutment  of  the  concrete  arch  dam.  This  jointed 
and  fractured  ridge  was  severely  affected  by  the  earth- 
quake, as  evidenced  by  extensive  cracks  in  the  gunite 
coating,  manv  of  which  penetrate  into  the  rock  below. 
A  small  rock  slide  occurred  some  15  feet  from  the 
accelerograph  but  fortunately  was  not  large  enough 
to  disturb  the  accelerograph  foundation.  After  the 
earthquake,  the  instrument  mounting  pier  was  still  sol- 
idly attached  to  the  foundation  rock,  and  the  mount- 
ing bolts  attaching  the  accelerograph  to  the  pier  ^\•ere 
tight  and  undisturbed.  Although  some  cracks  were 
observed  near  the  instrument  house,  apparently  none 
of  them  penetrated  to  the  base  of  the  accelerograph 
pier.  The  only  sign  of  permanent  disturbance  was  a 
small  permanent  tilt  of  the  instrument  during  the 
earthquake,  which  could  be  estimated  to  be  of  the 
order  of  half  a  degree.  This  tilt  was  just  sufficient  to 
close  the  electrical  contacts  on  the  horizontal  starting 
pendulum  so  that  the  accelerograph  continued  run- 
ning after  the  main  shock  for  some  6  minutes  until  the 


supply  of  photographic  paper  was  exhausted.  During 
this  interval,  at  least  30  aftershocks  were  recorded,  and 
in  this  sense  the  small  permanent  tilt  of  the  rock  may 
be  considered  as  a  fortunate  accident.  In  no  other  case 
has  such  an  exact  sequence  of  initial  aftershock  been 
recorded  in  the  epicentral  region. 

After  the  earthquake,  complete  tests  made  on  the 
accelerograph  showed  that  the  instrument  \\as  func- 
tioning correctly  and  that  there  were  no  significant 
disturbances  to  the  mechanism.  The  peak  acceleration 
values  remained  on  scale  on  the  photographic  paper, 
and  there  is  no  evidence  of  an  appreciable  nonlinear 
response  at  the  maximum  amplitudes  involved.  The 
qualirs'  of  the  photographic  trace  was  excellent  and 
permitted  an  accurate  and  complete  digitization. 

There  is  no  reason  to  doubt  that  the  accelerograph 
at  the  Pacoima  Dam  site  accurately  recorded  the  true 
motions  of  its  foundation  pier.  A  question  ma\-  be 
asked,  however,  as  to  the  relationship  ber^veen  the 
accelerations  on  the  particular  ridge  under  unusually 
complex  conditions  of  local  geolog\'  and  the  whole 
pattern  of  acceleration  measured  in  the  region.  How 
the  peak  accelerations  at  Pacoima  Dam  should  be  ex- 
pected to  compare  with  values  at  the  caretaker's  house 
below  the  dam,  where  little  damage  occurred,  or  at 
the  nearb\'  Olive  View  Hospital,  where  major  damage 
occurred,  are  questions  which  cannot  be  answered  in 
the  present  state  of  the  art.  It  seems  likely  that  details 
of  local  topography  and  geology  ma&gt;'  influence  such 
peak  values  in  a  major  way;  but,  until  many  more 
measurements  are  made,  there  can  be  no  definite  con- 
clusions for  specific  cases. 

Except  for  the  maximum  acceleration  recorded  at 
the  Pacoima  Dam  station,  maximum  accelerations  re- 
corded at  strong-motion  ground  level  stations  during 
the  San  Fernando  earthquake  were  not  unusual  in  com- 
parison with  maximum  accelerations  recorded  at  var- 
ious distances  from  epicenters  during  other  earthquakes. 
As  figure  11  indicates,  the  attenuation  of  maximum 
acceleration  with  distance  from  epicenter,  with  the  one 
e.xception,  agrees  reasonably  well  with  the  superim- 
posed curves  developed  by  Cloud  and  Perez  (1970) 
using  data  shown  in  figure  12.  Note  in  figure  12  that,

ence  directly  to  the  treatment  of  the  San  Fernando 
records  (Hudson,  1971). 

For  each  record,  reproduction  of  a  computer  plot 
plus  a  complete  print-out  of  the  digitized  record  is 
being  published  in  the  series  of  reports  "Strong-Motion 
Earthquake  Accelerograms  —  Digitized  and  Plotted 
Data,  Volume  I,  Uncorrected  Accelerograms,"  Earth- 
quake Engineering  Research  Laboratory,  California 
Institute  of  Technology.  At  the  time  of  the  San  Fer- 
nando earthquake.  Vol.  I,  Parts  A  and  B,  containing 
40  records  from  past  earthquakes,  had  been  published. 
Because  of  the  special  importance  of  the  San  Fernando 


earthquake,  the  sequence  of  past  earthquakes  was  in- 
terrupted, and  Vol.  I,  Part  C  (dated  July  1971),  con- 
tains the  first  of  the  San  Fernando  series  (Brady  et  al., 
1971). 

During  the  past  few  years,  several  automatic  digi- 
tal imaging  processes  have  been  developed  for  special 
applications,  such  as  the  digitization  of  space  photo- 
graphs, and  of  bubble-chamber  tracks  for  particle 
physics  investigations.  Several  of  these  systems  are 
directly  applicable  to  accelerograph  digitization.  The 
main  problems  in  the  use  of  such  equipment  are  (1) 
the  availability  of  the  special  equipment,  (2)  the  rel-

atively  complex  computer  programming  involved,  and 
(3)  establishing  accuracy  of  the  process.  Sample  earth- 
quake accelerograms  have  been  digitized  on  a  repre- 
sentative completely  automatic  system,  and  it  appears 
that  satisfactory  results  can  be  obtained  at  an  attractive 
cost  figure.  For  future  earthquake  accelerogram  anal- 
ysis, such  automatic  systems  offer  considerable  prom- 
ise and  will  no  doubt  be  widely  applied. 

In  digitizing  accelerograms  from  the  San  Fernando 
Earthquake,  priority  was  given  to  those  records  needed 
by  engineers  studying  particular  buildings. 


Once  the  digitized  data  are  available,  it  is  a  rel- 
atively simple  matter  to  carry  out  a  number  of  impor- 
tant calculations.  One  of  these  is  the  computation  of 
integrated  ground  velocity  and  displacement  curves 
from  the  accelerograms.  Various  errors  involved  in 
these  computational  processes  have  been  examined  in 
detail  in  previous  investigations,  and  standard  methods 
had  been  evolved  which  could  be  applied  directly  to 
the  San  Fernando  accelerograms  (Trifunac  and  Hud- 
son, 1970;  Trifunac  et  al.,  1971;  Trifunac,  1970;  Tri- 
funac, 1971;  Hudson,  et  al,  vol.  II,  1971).  Similarly,

history    of    the    strong-motion    recording    progr&lt; 


Envelope 


the  calcularion  of  response  spectrum  curves  and  of 
Fourier  spectra  have  been  extensively  investigated,  and 
suitable  computer  programs  had  been  worked  out 
which  were  available  for  direct  application  (Hudson 
et  al.,  vols.  Ill  and  IV,  1971).  A  number  of  these  calcu- 
lations have  already  been  completed,  but  in  view  of 
the  large  number  of  records  available,  and  of  the  time 
required  for  publishing  the  reports,  it  will  be  a  matter 
of  several  years  before  the  whole  backlog  of  past 
strong-motion  earthquake  accelerograms  can  be  com- 
pleted.* 

Figure  10  shows  an  example  of  a  computer  plot 
of  a  corrected  strong-motion  accelerogram,  along  with 
the  calculated  integrated  ground  velocity  and  displace- 
ment. Figure  13  is  a  plot  of  the  response  spectrum  to 
correspond  with  the  component  of  acceleration  shown 
in  figure  10  for  Pacoima  Dam.  Figures  14  and  15  are 
additional  examples  of  response  spectrum  calculations 
and  will  indicate  one  form  in  which  all  the  records 
will  be  ultimately  available. 

APPLICATION  OF  ACCELEROGRAPH  RESULTS 

The  information  contained  in  the  accelerograms 
can  be  used  in  several  different  wa\s  to  carrv  out  fun- 


•  In  the  meantime,  such  data  will  be  available  on   request 
on  an   individual  basis  for  the  more  important  sites. 


damental  investigations  in  earthquake  engineering  and 
strong-motion  seismology.  Some  of  these  applications 
will  now  be  outlined,  along  with  specific  examples. 

EARTHQUAKE  SOURCE  MECHANISMS 

The  accelerogram  obtained  at  Pacoima  Dam,  vir- 
tually at  the  center  of  the  epicentral  region  and  di- 
recth'  over  the  main  thrust  fault  involved  in  the  earth- 
quake, offers  an  unparalleled  opportunity-  for  studies 
of  earthquake  source  mechanisms.  Not  only  was  the 
main  shock  recorded,  but,  as  was  mentioned  above,  the 
initial  sequence  of  some  30  aftershocks  immediately 
following  the  main  shock  was  also  recorded.  From  this 
continuous  record  of  the  main  shock  and  its  immediate 
aftersiiocks,  basic  source  parameters  such  as  stress 
drops,  seismic  moments,  magnitudes,  and  spectral  prop- 
erties have  been  determined  for  comparison  with  later 
aftershocks  in  the  developing  pattern  of  propagating 
fracture  (Hudson  et  ai,  vol.  IV.  1971;Trifunac,  1971). 
This  initial  aftershock  information  fills  an  important 
parr  of  the  gap  in  the  data  before  the  regular  seismo- 
logical  instrumentation  began  to  acquire  aftershock 
information.  .\  complete  analysis  of  the  earthquake 
taking  into  account  the  whole  sequence  of  events  and 
comparisons  w  ith  distant  recordings  w  ill  no  doubt  con- 
siderably advance  current  understanding  of  earthquake 
source  mechanisms.

LOCAL  DISTRIBUTION  OF  EARTHQUAKE 
GROUND  MOTION 

A  second  important  application  of  the  accelero- 
gram is  to  describe  the  variation  of  ground  shaking 
over  the  area  affected  b\'  rhc  earthquake  in  accurate 
quantitative  terms.  Although  there  were  not  as  many 
accelcrograph  stations  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the 
epicentral  area  as  one  would  have  liked,  there  were 
enough  in  various  directions  to  clearly  indicate  the 
great  complexity  of  the  pattern  of  ground  shaking. 
Stations  to  the  north  of  the  epicenter,  such  as  Castaic 
and  Lake  Hughes,  showed  in  some  cases  unusuall\' 
high  peak  accelerations  compared  with  stations  at  a 
similar  distance  to  the  south.  The  explanation  for  such 
variations  must  be  sought  for  in  local  geological  con- 
ditions and  in  variations  in  travel  path  geometries  and 
will  no  doubt  result  in  a  more  realistic  appraisal  of  the 
true  complexity  of  the  problem. 

The  distribution  of  ground  shaking  over  the  entire 
southern  California  region  is  indicated  by  the  maps 
of  figures  2,  3,  and  4.  At  each  accelcrograph  station, 
the  peak  ground  acceleration  in  fractions  of  gravity  is 
indicated.  This  quantitative  description  of  the  distribu- 
tion of  ground  shaking  is  of  course  a  key  feature  in 
an  understanding  of  the  effects  of  the  earthquake  on 
structures  and  makes  it  possible  to  carry  out  a  much 
more  derailed  investigation  of  the  implications  of  the 
event  for  the  development  of  earthquake  resistant  de- 
sign than  has  been  feasible  for  any  previous  earthquake. 
Taken  in  connection  with  the  seismoscope  results, 
which  fill  in  additional  details  of  local  distribution,  the 
detail  obtained  in  this  earthquake  is  better  by  orders 
of  magnitude  than  has  been  obtained  in  any  past  earth- 
quake. 

A  preliminary  evaluation  of  the  general  pattern  of 
ground  motion  distribution  tends  to  suggest  that  the 
true  state  of  affairs  as  revealed  by  the  measurements 
is  rather  more  complicated  than  had  been  contemplated 
by  certain  simplified  models.  It  seems  highly  unlikely 
that  any  single  factor,  such  as  thickness  of  soil  layers, 
distance  from  faults,  etc.,  will  be  adequate  for  even 
a  rough  description  of  the  pattern. 

The  acceleration  measurements  should  also  make 
it  possible  to  enhance  the  significance  of  isoseismal 
intensity  maps  based  on  postcard  surveys.  By  correlat- 
ing varying  aspects  of  the  acceleration  measurements 
with  the  Modified  Mercalli  intensities,  it  may  be  pos- 
sible to  improve  the  usefulness  of  these  subjective 
evaluations.  Since  such  intensity  data  are  the  only  in- 
formation available  for  many  important  earthquakes 
of  the  past,  as  well  as  for  many  current  earthquakes 
occurring  in  regions  with  little  strong-motion  instru- 
mentation, they  will  be  of  great  importance  to  im- 
prove the  intensity  values. 

THE  EARTHQUAKE  AS  A  STRUCTURAL  DYNAMIC  TEST 

A  third  important  application  of  the  accelerograms 
is  to  the  calculation  of  the  dynamic  structural  prop- 
erties of  buildings  in  which  multiple  accelerographs 
had  been  placed.  In  1965  the  City  of  Los  Angeles 
added  to  its  building  code  a  requirement  that  three 
strong-motion   accelerographs  should   be  installed   in 


each  new  structure  over  six  stories  in  height.  One  of 
these  instruments  was  to  be  installed  in  the  basement 
to  record  the  input  earthquake  ground  motion,  and  the 
other  two  were  to  be  placed  at  the  top  of  the  building 
and  at  an  intermediate  location  to  describe  the  earth- 
quake response  of  the  structure.  In  1970  the  Uniform 
Building  Code  adopted  this  accelcrograph  regulation 
in  an  appendix  which  was  adapted  by  a  number  of 
cities,  .^t  the  time  of  the  earthquake,  over  50  buildings 
were  instrumented  under  these  regulations,  and  these 
code  stations  thus  constituted  by  far  the  major  source 
of  accelerographs  for  the  southern  California  ner^vork. 

Figure  8  shows  a  typical  set  of  three  accelero- 
grams from  a  building,  in  this  case  the  instrumented 
building  nearest  the  epicenter  (20  km).  It  will  be  noted 
that  the  peak  ground  acceleration  was  0.27  g,  while 
the  8th  floor  roof  showed  peak  accelerations  of  0.39  g. 
Although  these  acceleration  values  are  considerably 
larger  than  would  be  contemplated  by  the  seismic  de- 
sign force  .specifications  of  the  buildins:  code,  no  sig- 
nificant structural  damage  was  suffered  by  the  building. 
There  was,  however,  a  considerable  amount  of  non- 
structural damage  to  the  building  and  its  contents, 
which  cost  approximately  $100,000  to  repair.  The 
situation  at  this  building  is  a  good  example  of  the  way 
in  which  accelcrograph  readings  make  it  possible  to 
study  the  true  structtiral  characteristics  in  considerable 
detail.  Without  the  measurements,  it  would  have  been 
virtually  impossible  to  have  inferred  from  the  appear- 
ance of  the  building  and  its  contents  what  the  ground 
motions  had  actually  been,  and  estimates  of  input 
forces  might  well  have  been  off  by  a  factor  of  2  or  3. 

In  table  3  a  and  b  are  shown  some  typical  multi- 
story buildings  for  which  complete  acceleration  data 
were  obtained  during  the  earthquake.  It  will  be  noted 
that  peak  accelerations  of  the  order  of  0.40  g  were  not 
uncommon  at  upper  floor  locations.  When  it  is  re- 
membered that  the  highest  accelerations  to  which  it 
has  been  possible  to  excite  full-scale  multi-story  build- 
ings by  means  of  vibration-generator  test  equipment 
is  of  the  order  of  0.03  g  to  0.04  g,  it  will  be  seen  that 
the  earthquake  has  involved  accelerations  of  about  10 
times  the  magnitude  of  past  tests.  The  earthquake  may 
thus  be  thought  of  as  a  structural  dynamic  test  on  a 
vast  scale.  At  one  stroke,  some  50  structures  have  been 
dynamically  tested  under  measured  conditions  at  force 
levels  far  beyond  the  capabilities  of  any  other  test 
procedure. 

STRUCTURAL  RESPONSE 

As  an  example  of  the  way  in  which  the  accelero- 
grapii  records  can  be  used  to  interpret  such  dynamic 
tests  of  structures,  the  results  of  an  analysis  of  the 
Kajima  Building  will  be  outlined.  A  notable  investiga- 
tion of  this  structure  has  been  conducted  by  Dr.  K. 
Muto  (1971)  of  the  Kajima  Corporation,  based  on  the 
accelerograms.  Figure  16  shows  schematically  the  way 
in  which  the  actual  stnicture  is  represented  by  a  sim- 
plified mathematical  model.  The  initial  object  of  the 
investigation  is  to  define  the  model  numerically  and 
to  verify  its  general  appropriateness  and  accuracy  by 
showing  that  it  can  in  fact  represent  the  measured  re- 
sponse of  the  actual  building  to  this  particular  earth-

quake. 

The  lowest  curve  of  figure  17  is  the  acceleration 
time  record  obtained  in  the  basement  during  the  earth- 
quake. The  upper  solid  curves  are  the  measured  accel- 
erations recorded  at  upper  floor  locations  during  the 
earthquake.  Tiie  dotted  curves  are  the  calculated  re- 
sponses using  the  mathematical  mode!  of  figure  16  with 
the  measured  basement  acceleration  as  the  input  mo- 
tion. The  numerical  parameters  of  the  mathematical 
model  such  as  stiffnesses  and  damping  values  were  in 
effect  adjusted  by  var\'ing  them  over  small  ranges  so 
that  the  calculated  and  measured  accelerations  agreed 
as  closely  as  possible  over  the  duration  of  the  record. 
The  excellent  agreement  obtained  indicates  that  the 
relatively  simple  mathematical  mode!  of  figure  16  does 
in  fact  result  in  a  reasonably  accurate  representation 
of  the  actual  structure. 

Having  once  established  the  validity  of  the  math- 
ematical model,  the  distribution  of  such  factors  as  the 


shear  forces  can  be  calculated  for  all  floors.  Figure  18 
summarizes  this  shear  force  distribution  for  the  Kajima 
Building.  The  curve  on  the  left  gives  the  standard  de- 
sign seismic  shear  forces  as  presented  by  the  lateral 
force  provisions  of  the  Structural  Engineers  -\ssocia- 
tion  of  California  seismic  code.  The  middle  curve  rep- 
resents the  measured  shears  during  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake,  determined  as  described  abo\e.  The  right- 
hand  curve  represents  the  ultimate  strength  limiting 
conditions  at  the  various  floors.  It  will  be  noted  that, 
although  this  particular  earthquake  loaded  the  struc- 
ture to  about  tw  ice  the  code  design  values,  the  ulti- 
mate resistances  were  not  approached.  This  illustrates 
in  a  graphic  way  the  possible  large  gaps  between  the 
prescribed  code  forces  and  the  ultimate  resistances. 
It  is  of  course  always  advisable  to  provide  a  suitable 
margin  of  safety  between  design  forces  and  ultimate 
resistances,  but  it  is  also  important  in  the  interests  of 
economy    that    this    margin    be    reasonably    uniform

throughout  the  structure  and  that  its  true  value  be 
known. 

Having  learned  from  the  above  analysis  the  extent 
to  which  the  dynamical  calculations  agree  with  meas- 
urenicnr,  the  response  of  the  building  to  other  input 
ground  motions  can  now  be  carried  out  with  some 
assurance.  In  this  \\n\\  the  important  (juestion  as  to 
how  the  building  would  have  pcrformeti  had  it  been 
located  in  the  epicentral  region  can  be  answered  with 
a  reasonable  accuracy.  By  carrying  out  an  analysis  of 
the  above  type  for  all  of  the  instrumented  buildings 
in  the  Los  Angeles  region,  the  \cr\-  important  question 
of  how  modern  high-rise  buildings  will  behave  under 
the  highest  possible  seismic  forces  can  be  answered 
without  waiting  for  the  destructive  earthquake  itself. 
Without  the  accelcrograph  measurements,  it  would  of 
course  be  virtually  impossible  to  answer  this  critical 
question  with  any  degree  of  assurance. 

CODE  DESIGN  FORCES 

The  acceleration  values  measured  during  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake  were  considerably  larger  than 


had  been  generally  anticipated  for  an  event  of  that 
size.  It  has  of  course  alwa\s  been  recognized  that  the 
lateral  force  coefficients  specified  in  earthquake-resist- 
ant design  codes  are  not  to  be  directl&gt;'  equated  to 
earthquake  ground  accelerations.  Such  coefficients 
must  always  be  considered  as  an  integral  part  of  a 
whole  design  technique,  involving  standardized  calcu- 
lation procedures,  prescribed  allowable  stresses,  and  a 
thorough  knowledge  of  standard  constructional  details. 
On  the  basis  of  the  San  Fernando  measurements,  it  is 
clear  that  the  prescribed  lateral  force  coefficients  seri- 
ously underestimate  the  actual  seismic  forces.  The 
performance  of  most  structures  also  makes  it  clear 
that  the  true  ultimate  resistance  of  most  structures 
have  also  been  underestimated.  These  two  underesti- 
mations  cannot  always  be  expected  to  exactl\'  compen- 
sate. The  earthquake  demonstrated  forceful!)'  that,  al- 
though this  standard  design  philosoph\'  may  result  in 
man\'  satisfactor\'  structures  of  a  conventional  type, 
there  may  be  disastrous  exceptions.  The  new  buildings 
which  collapsed  with  loss  of  life  at  the  Olive  View- 
Hospital  satisfied  the  specific  requirements  of  the 
building  code,  but  the\-  did  not  meet  the  all-important

of  reformulating  the  basic  earthquake-resistant  design 
codes  to  keep  step  with  the  rapidh'  improving  knowl- 
edge of  the  basic  nature  of  earthquake  motions  and 
forces  and  with  ever-improving  methods  of  structural 
analysis. 

NATURAL  PERIOD  MEASUREMENTS 

The  accelerograph  measurements  in  buildings 
throw  a  considerable  light  on  another  aspect  of  struc- 
tural dynamic  anal\'sis,  involving  the  determination  of 
the  natural  periods  of  structures. 

A  rclativeh'  simple  measurement  which  will  reveal 
significant  information  about  the  dynamic  properties 
of  a  structure  is  an  experimental  determination  of  the 
natural  periods  of  vibration  (Housner,  1962;  Hudson, 
1971).  Since  the  natural  period  involves  both  the  mass 
and  the  flc\ihilir\-  of  a  structure,  an  experimental  veri- 
fication of  a  calculated  period  will  provide  a  useful 
check  on  the  validit\-  of  both  the  mathematical  models 
anti  the  numerical  values  emplo\-ed. 

Another  application  of  natural  period  information 
involves  the  idea  that  large  building  vibrations  caused 
b&gt;'  a  damaging  earthquake  might  result  in  permanent 
changes  of  the  period.  Such  changes  have  in  fact  been 
observed  during  past  earthquakes  (Fsteva  y  Nicto, 
1967;  Cloud  and  iMalcy,  1970).  It  might  thus  be  pos- 
sible to  infer  from  a  measured  change  in  natural  period 
during  an  earthquake  that  significant  structural  dam- 
age had  occurred  which  might  not  be  evident  from  a 
superficial  examination  of  the  building.  In  that  event, 
a  relativelv  expensive  structural  examination  might  be 


justified.  Such  studies  can  be  made  onl\-  if  there  exists 
a  large  body  of  pre-earthquake  period  measurements 
to  form  a  basis  of  comparison  with  post-earthquake 
measurements.  This  has  been  the  motivation  behind  an 
extensive  program  of  determination  of  natural  periods 
of  structures  carried  out  by  the  Seismological  Field 
Survey  of  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric 
.Administration. 

The  natural  periods  of  buildings  arc  usually  deter- 
mined by  recording  small  vibrations  caused  by  wind 
excitations.  The  motions  are  of  course  much  smaller  by 
several  orders  of  magnitude  than  those  associated  with 
damaging  forces,  and  one  of  the  main  questions  in- 
volves the  extent  to  which  properties  determined  at 
these  very  low  levels  can  be  extrapolated  to  larger 
excitation.  The  information  obtained  during  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake  from  the  building  accelerographs 
goes  a  long  way  to\\'ards  clarif\'ing  this  situation. 

In  table  4  are  sho\\n  data  from  several  buildings 
for  which  lo\\'-level  period  measurements  are  available 
both  before  and  after  the  earthquake  and  can  be  com- 
pared directly  with  values  obtained  during  the  much 
larger  motions  of  the  earthquake.  The  records  of  fig- 
ure 19  are  typical.  The  low-level  ^\•ind-excited  and 
man-excited  (Kuroiwa,  1967)  periods  were  determined 
unambiguously  from  records  of  the  type  shown  in 
figure  19  (a  and  c).  The  accelerogram  reproduced  in 
figure  19  (b)  shoM's  that,  after  the  initial  transient  part 
of  the  earthquake  which  excited  simultaneously  a  num- 
ber of  modes  of  vibration,  the  building  motion  settled 
down  into  a  clear  single-frequency  sinusoidal  oscilla- 
tion at  its  fundamental  period,  which  is  clearly  evident 
on  the  record  and  can  be  directly  measured  \\ith  con- 
siderable accuracy. 

A  very  important  fact  which  emerges  from  table 
4  and  figure  19  is  that  the  period  of  the  building  dur- 
ing the  relativcK"  large  motions  of  the  earthquake  is 
considerably  longer  than  the  low-level  periods  deter- 
mined from  the  wind  excitation.  This  pronounced  non- 
linear behavior  must  ah\ays  be  kept  in  mind  when 
comparing  periods  of  mathematical  models  with  pe- 
riods experimentally  determined.  It  is  hoped  that  a 
stud\"  of  the  very  complete  data  obtained  during  the 
San  Fernando  earthquake  will  permit  an  accurate  as- 
sessment of  these  nonlinear  effects. 

Although  table  4  indicates  that  there  was  a  consid- 
erable permanent  shift  in  natural  period  caused  by  the 
earthquake  in  man\-  buildings,  apparentlx"  none  of  the 
buildings  suffered  significant  structural  damage.  The 
potential  usefulness  of  period  shifts  as  an  indication 
of  l.idden  damage  thus  becomes  questionable.  If  even 
larger  period  changes  can  occur  without  serious  struc- 
tural damage,  it  ma&gt;-  be  difficult  if  not  impossible  to 
decide  the  amount  of  period  shift  for  a  particular 
structure  which  should  be  taken  as  an  indication  of 
structural  damage  rather  than  nonstructural  damage. 
It  is  hoped  that  detailed  studies  now  being  made  of  a 
number  of  the  instrumented  buildings  will  provide  a 
definitive  answer  to  such  questions.

accelerographs  that  constitute  the  main  source  of  in- 
formation from  the  strong-motion  network,  there  are 
in  the  southern  California  region  over  1 20  seismoscopes 
which  provide  valuable  supplementary  data. 

The  seismoscope  is  a  simplified  device  which  di- 
rectly records  for  all  horizontal  directions  of  one  point 
on  the  response  spectrum  curve.  It  consists  of  a  free 
conical  pendulum  which  can  move  in  any  horizontal 
direction.  The  \\  ire  fle.xure  pivot  support  point  of  the 
pendulum  moves  with  the  ground,  and  the  resulting 
angular  deflections  relative  to  the  instrument  frame 
are  recorded  by  a  scriber  on  a  smoked  spherical  watch 
glass.  Eddy  current  damping  is  provided  by  an  alum- 
inum disk  in  the  form  of  a  segment  of  a  spherical  shell, 
which  moves  between  the  poles  of  a  permanent  mag- 
net SN'stem.  Since  the  motion  in  the  horizontal  plane  is 
traced  out  as  a  permanent  record,  the  sequence  of 
events  can  he  followed  even  though  no  time-recording 
is  employed  and  the  directions  of  maximum  motions 
are  indicated. 

The  natural  period  of  the  seismoscope  pendulum 
is  a  nominal  0.75  seconds,  and  the  damping  is  adjusted 
to  approximately  10  percent  of  critical  damping.  These 
values  give  a  response  spectrum  point  near  the  middle 
of  the  range  of  structural  interest  and  hence  provide  in 
a  physically  meaningful  wax-  a  quantitative  measure  of 
the  damaging  effects  of  the  earthquake.  Since  15  to  20 
seismoscopes  can  be  acquired  for  the  cost  of  one  time- 
recording  accelerograph,  the  seismoscope  can  be  effec- 
tively' used  to  fill  in  gaps  in  the  network  coverage  and 
thus  to  supplement  the  more  complete  information 
obtained  from  the  accelerographs. 


The  map  of  figure  20  shows  the  seismoscope  sites 
producing  records  during  the  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake. Centered  on  each  station  is  a  line  segment  whose 
length  is  proportional  to  the  maximum  excursion  on 
the  seismoscope  plate  and  w  hose  direction  indicates  the 
direction  of  the  maximum  response.  Some  120  records 
\\cre  obtained,  and  it  is  evident  from  figure  20  that 
the  readings  reveal  in  a  striking  way  the  great  complex- 
ity of  the  pattern  of  local  distribution  of  heavy  ground 
shaking.  Tabular  values  of  the  spectrum  responses  and 
of  associated  information  such  as  distance  from  the 
epicenter  were  compiled  in  Hudson's  report  (1971). 

In  figure  21  are  sho\\n  several  examples  of  seis- 
moscope records  photograpiied  directly  from  the  orig- 
inal glass  record  plates.  In  all  figures.  North  is  upward, 
and  the  diagonal  line  is  tiie  N.67AV.  direction  which 
approximates  the  strike  of  the  fault. 

The  two  sites  of  figures  21  (a)  and  (b)  are  lo- 
cated le.ss  than  half  a  kilometer  apart  on  the  same  geo- 
logical and  soil  conditions  consisting  of  250-300  m  of 
old  alluvium  over  crystalline  rock.  The  somewhat 
larger  values  of  figure  21  (a)  perhaps  reflect  a  differ- 
ence in  the  interaction  between  the  9-storv  reinforced 
concrete  Millikan  Library  building  and  the  foundation 
soils,  compared  with  the  2 '  j  -story  concrete  Athenaeum 
building.  Accelerograph  recordings  were  made  at  the 
same  sites,  and  further  studies  will  be  necessary  to 
fully  explain  the  situation. 

A  comparison  of  figures  21  (a)  and  (b)  with 
figure  21  (c)  is  also  instructive.  The  station  at  the 
Seismological  Laboratory  figure  21  (c)  is  located  ort 
a  cr\stalline  rock  of  a  granitic  character,  weathered

near  the  surface.  Comparisons  made  bcn\ecn  ground 
motions  measured  at  the  Scismological  Laboratory  and 
at  the  Caltech  campus  for  small  earthquakes  have 
sho\\-n  on  the  average  significantl&gt;'  higher  motions  at 
the  campus  (Gutenberg,  1957).  For  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake,  ho\\ever,  in  the  same  period  ranges,  the 
motion  on  the  rock  at  the  Scismological  Laboratory 
was  somewhat  larger  than  on  the  campus  alluvium. 
This  conclusion  is  also  confirmed  by  accelerograph 
recordings  at  the  same  t\vo  sites.  In  addition,  it  can 
be  noted  from  figure  21  (c)  that  the  motion  at  the 
Scismological  Laborator\-  was  almost  uni-directional, 
to  a  more  striking  extent  than  at  any  other  station  in 
the  whole  network.  This  indicates  ho\\'  the  seismo- 
scope  can  reveal  certain  significant  details  of  strong 
ground  motion. 

The  two  lower  figures  of  figure  21  show  unusu- 
all\'  large  responses  on  the  abutment  and  crest  of  the 
dam  at  Fagle  Rock  Reservoir.  Referring  to  the  map 
of  figure  20  it  will  be  seen  that  these  appear  to  be 
anomalousK-  high  values  for  the  distance  from  the  epi- 
center, although  they  seem  to  be  part  of  a  band  of 
unusually  high  values  following  along  the  base  of  the 
mountains.  The  record  of  figure  21  (d)  from  the  \''an 
Nuys  High  School  is  another  example  of  large  values, 
in  this  case  sho\\ing  excellent  detail. 

The  seismoscope  records  from  the  abutment  and 
crest  of  the  lo^^'er  San  Fernando  Dam  are  of  unusual 
interest  as  they  are  the  only  measurements  of  the 
strong  ground  shaking  at  this  important  site,  other 
than  one  peak-reading  accelerograph  on  the  failed 
crest.  In  view  of  the  great  importance  of  a  complete 
stud\-  of  the  failure  of  the  dam,  a  special  effort  has 
been  made  to  deduce  from  the  seismoscope  record  on 
the  abutment  approximate  values  of  the  ground  accel- 
eration (Scott,  in  press).  A  recovery  of  the  ground 
acceleration-time  history  from  the  seismoscope  plate 
can  in  theory  be  accomplished,  but  in  practice  it  is 
only  under  certain  spcciall\-  favorable  conditions  that 
a  useful  accuracy  can  be  attained.  In  the  case  of  the 
Lower  San  Fernando  Dam,  it  is  believed  that  the  ac- 
curacy of  the  response  spectrum  curves  calculated 
from  the  acceleration-time  record  derived  from  the 
seismoscope  record  is  of  the  order  of  10-20  percent. 

SUMMARY 

The  main  shock  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake 
(Richter  magnitude  6.&gt;  BRK,  6.4  PAS;  Modified  .Mer- 
calli   Scale   maximum   intensity    XI;    felt   area    80,000 


square  miles)  was  recorded  b\-  241  accelerographs  and 
120  seismoscopcs.  These  more  than  double  the  number 
of  strong-motion  instrument  records  that  were  avail- 
able prior  to  the  earthquake. 

Among  the  more  significant  results  from  prelim- 
inary analysis  of  the  records  are  the  following: 

1.  The  highest  earthquake  accelerations  ever  measured,  1.25 
g  horizontolly  and  0.72  g  vertically,  were  recorded  on  the 
abutment  of  Pacoima  Dam,  8  km  from  the  reported  epicenter. 
The  previous  maximums  were  0.5  g,  recorded  a  few  hundred 
feet  from  surface  faulting  on  alluvium  during  the  June  27, 
1966,  Porkfleld,  California,  earthquake,  and  about  0.6  g  re- 
corded at  Ko/na  Dam,  India,  December  11,  1967. 

2.  Except  for  the  high  frequency  peak  accelerations  at  Pa- 
coima Dam,  attenuation  of  maximum  ground  occelerotion  with 
distance  from  epicenter  is  reasonably  consistent  with  the  em- 
pirical equations  developed  from  earthquakes  recorded  in  the 
past. 

3.  The  large  values  of  the  Pacoima  Dam  site  maximum  accel- 
erations coupled  with  additional  large  high-frequency  accel- 
eration peaks  from  Peruvian  earthquakes  and  from  Koyna, 
India,  indicate  a  need  to  investigote  in  more  detoil  accelera- 
tions in  the  period  range  below  0.1  sec, 

4.  During  the  earthquake,  the  fundamental  periods  of  most 
instrumented  buildings  were  considerably  longer  than  those 
measured  under  light  wind  excitation  before  and  after  the 
earthquake. 

5.  Fundamental  periods  of  many  buildings  meosured  after  the 
earthquake  under  light  wind  excitation  were  found  to  be 
somewhat  longer  than  when  measured  prior  to  the  earth- 
quake, indicating  that  the  earthquake  had  caused  some  alter- 
ation in  the  dynamic  properties  of  the  structures.  In  no  cose 
was  any  significant  structural  damage  associated  with  these 
period  changes. 

6.  Peak  acceleration  exceeded  0.3  g  on  the  top  floors  of  20 
high  rise  buildings.  No  significant  structural  damage  was  ob- 
served. 

The  unprecedented  amount  of  valuable  data  on 
strong  earthquake-generated  motion  obtained  during 
the  San  Fernando  earthquake  marks  a  major  step  for- 
\yard  in  engineering  seismology  and  indicates  the  addi- 
tional information  that  may  be  anticipated  from  the 
rapidl\-  increasing  network  of  strong-motion  instru- 
ments in  the  United  States  and  other  countries.

CHAPTER     23 


A  Preliminory  Evoluofion  of  the  Effects  of  Topography 

on  Ground  Motion^ 


by  Lawrence  L.  Davis  ^  and  Lewis  R.  West  ' 


The  ground  motion  at  any  particular  site  is  a  func- 
tion of  numerous  parameters  and  variables  acting  at 
the  source,  along  the  transmission  path,  and  at  the  local 
receiver  site.  In  assessing  the  safety  of  any  given  site, 
accurate  ground-motion  predictions  are  required.  The 
accuracy  of  the  ground-motion  predictions  depends 
upon  the  degree  to  which  the  numerous  interacting 
phenomena  are  understood  and  accounted  for  in  the 
prediction. 

The  effects  under  consideration  in  this  paper  are 
those  at  and  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  recording 
site.  Much  work  has  been  done  toward  understanding 
the  effect  of  the  rock  and  soil  profile  at  the  recording 
site  (Murphy  et  al,  1971;  Schultz,  1967;  Murphy  and 
Davis,  1969),  but  a  principal  problem  remaining  in  the 
area  of  recording  site  effects  is  the  effect  of  topog- 
raphy on  ground  motion.  Neither  the  extent  to  which 
ground  motion  might  be  affected  by  topography  nor 
what  the  parameters  of  a  topographic  feature  are  that 
influence  ground  motion  is  known.  The  effects  prob- 
ably are  not  important  when  the  seismic  wave  lengths 
are  much  longer  than  the  dimensions  of  the  topo- 
graphic feature;  however,  since  in  many  engineering 
applications  short  wave  lengths  (high-frequency 
motion)  may  be  expected  on  steep  slopes,  the  effects 
need  to  be  better  understood. 

There  is  empirical  evidence  that  topography  does 
affect  ground  motion  and,  in  particular,  that  motion 
can  be  amplified  on  the  crest  of  a  topographic  feature. 
In  1968,  Clarksmobile,  a  nuclear  detonation  at  the 
Nevada  Test  Site,  provided  a  hint  that  topography 
might  be  important.  At  numerous  recording  instru- 
ments deployed  in  and  around  Tonopah,  Nevada, 
amplitudes  recorded  on  mountain  tops  were  larger 
than  the  amplitudes  recorded  in  the  valley. 

More  recently,  Boore  (1972)  reported  that  churned 
ground  and  overturned  boulders  were  observed  fol- 
lowing several  earthquakes.  These  observations  were 
noted  only  on  ridge  crests  or  other  topographically 
high  features.  In  the  same  paper,  Boore  examined  cal- 
culated SH  waves  incident  on  three  different  topo- 
graphic models  and,  using  spectral  ratios  of  the  ampli- 
tudes at  various  points  on  the  topographic  feature,  he 
found  that  amplitudes  on  the  crest  were  amplified  and 
that  amplitudes  along  the  flanks  could  either  be  ampli- 
fied (to  a  lesser  degree  than  on  the  crest)  or  damped 
depending  on  the  geometry  of  the  model  and  the  posi- 
tion on  the  flank.   As  one  might  expect,  his  results 

'  Manuscript  submitted  for  publication  August  11,  1972.

Vegas,  Nevada. 


showed  that  the  amplification  (or  damping)  is  depend- 
ent upon  the  relationship  between  the  dimensions  of 
the  topographic  feature  and  the  wave  length  of  the  in- 
cident wave;  that  is,  the  effects  are  frequency-de- 
pendent. 

In  another  recent  investigation  (Aboudi,  1971), 
the  effects  of  a  small  surface  obstacle  with  slightly 
different  properties  than  the  elastic  half-space  were 
examined.  The  results  showed  that  Rayleigh  and  re- 
flected waves  were  influenced  by  the  presence  of  a 
surface  feature. 

DESCRIPTION  OF  INSTRUMENTATION  PROGRAMS 
Two  field  programs  obtained  data  on  the  effects 
of  topography  on  ground  motion.  Seismic  instruments 
were  placed  at  the  crest  and  at  the  base  of  Kagel 
Mountain  and  Josephine  Peak  during  May  1971,  while 
aftershocks  from  the  February  9  San  Fernando  earth-

quake  were  srill  occurring.  Figure  I  shows  the  loca- 
tions of  the  two  mountains  and  the  epicenters  of  after- 
shocks recorded.  The  innuntains  \\ere  selected  because 
of  their  cas\'  access  via  roads,  uniform  geology,  and 
relativel\'  simple  geometry.  Mountains  with  uniform 
geology  were  selected  so  that  any  difference  between 
motions  at  the  top  and  at  the  bottom  of  the  mountains 
could  be  attributed  to  topography  rather  than 
geology. 

Three  component  L-7  velocity-meter  systems  were 
installed  and  operated  by  the  Special  Projects  Party 
of  the  Earth  Sciences  Laboratory,  National  Oceanic 
and  Atmospheric  Administration.  King  (1969)  gave  a 
detailed  description  of  the  L-7  velocity-meter  system. 
One  vertical  and  two  horizontal  (oriented  north/south 
and  east/west)  seismometers  were  installed  at  each 
station — Station  82  on  the  crest  of  Kagel  Mountain 


and  Station  83  at  the  base  of  Kagel  Mountain  near 
Pacoima  Dam.  Station  80  was  located  on  top  of 
Josephine  Peak,  Station  81  was  at  the  base  of  the 
peak  in  Tujunga  Canvon.  Figure  2  shows  the  con- 
figuration of  Kagel  Mountain  and  the  location  of  the 
rwo  seismic  stations.  Josephine  Peak  with  its  instru- 
ment location  is  illustrated  in  figure  3. 

SEISMIC  DATA 
The  velocity  seismograms  were  processed  to  ob- 
tain acceleration  and  displacement  time  histories  and 
pseudo  relative-velocity  (PSRV)  spectra  with  5  per- 
cent damping.  PSRV  spectra  are  useful  for  characteriz- 
ing the  spectral  composition  of  a  seismogram.  The 
PSRV  spectrum  represents  the  peak  response  of  an 
ensemble  of  single-degree-of-freedom  oscillators  to  the 
input  ground  motion  and,  for  low  values  of  damping,

is  a   close   approximation   to   the   Fourier   amplitude 
spectrum  (Lane,  1972). 

Good-quality  data  were  recorded  at  the  crest  of 
Kagel  Mountain  (Station  82)  and  at  the  base  (Station 
83,  near  Pacoima  Dam);  Station  82  recorded  on  only 
two  components  (vertical  and  north/south)  while 
Station  83  recorded  all  three  components  of  motion. 
Four  aftershock  signals  recorded  at  the  Kagel  Moun- 
tain stations  were  selected  for  processing  and  analysis. 
At  Josephine  Peak,  only  two  good-quality  aftershock 
signals  were  recorded  at  both  stations;  all  three  com- 
ponents of  motion  were  recorded. 

DISCUSSION 

The  effects  of  topography  can  be  determined  by 
comparing  the  ground  motion  on  a  topographic  fea- 
ture with  the  motion  recorded  at  the  base  of  the  fea- 
ture. Any  difference  should  be  caused  by  topography 
as  long  as  other  effects,  unrelated  to  topography,  can 
be  eliminated  or  minimized.  These  other  effects  would 
be  caused   by  variations  in  the  source,   transmission 


path,  or  local  receiver  site  regimes.  Source  effects  were 
eliminated  by  taking  crest-to-base  ratios  of  the  data 
separately  for  each  aftershock.  Transmission  path  ef- 
fects were  minimized  by  keeping  the  distance  between 
the  crest  and  base  stations  small  relative  to  the  distance 
between  the  aftershock  epicenter  and  the  suite  of 
stations.  The  effects  of  local  station  geolog&gt;'  were 
minimized  by  selecting  mountains  with  uniform 
geology  such  that  the  crest  and  base  stations  could 
be  placed  on  the  same  geologic  material.  PSRV 
spectral  ratios  (ratios  of  the  motion  at  the  top  to 
motion  at  the  bottom)  are  shown  on  figures  4  and  5 
for  Kagel  Mountain  and  Josephine  Peak.  Crest-to-base 
ratios  of  the  peak  amplitudes  are  listed  in  table  1.  The 
peak  amplitude  is  the  largest  amplitude  recorded  on  the 
seismogram,  independent  of  its  time  of  arrival  or 
period. 

The  ground  motion  recorded  at  the  top  of  each 
mountain  is  considerably  larger  than  that  recorded  at 
the  base.  The  spectral  ratios  show  that  the  topographic 
amplification   is    frequency-dependent,    as    would    be

expected.  It  is  also  evident  tiiat  the  manner  in  which 
the  motions  arc  amplified  is  different  for  each  moun- 
tain; that  is,  the  amount  of  amplification  and  the  period 
ranges  that  are  amplified  are  different.  The  mountains 
are  different  in  size,  altliough  they  are  similar  in  shape 
(the  ratio  of  the  half  width  to  the  height  is  nearly  con- 
stant— appro.ximately  3'/:,  an  average  slope  of  about 
16°).  Kagel  Mountain  is  smaller  than  Josephine  Peak, 
with  a  height  of  about  1400  feet  and  a  half  width  of 
roughly  5000  feet.  Josephine  Peak  has  a  height  of  3500 
feet  and  a  half  width  of  12,000  feet.  There  is  a  very 
noticeable  difference  in  the  shape  of  the  spectral-ratio 
curve  with  mountain  size  (see  figures  4  and  5).  At 
Kagel  .Mountain,  the  amplification  occurs  over  a 
narrow  range  of  periods.  At  the  larger  mountain, 
Josephine  Peak,  the  spectral-ratio  cur\c  shows  ampli- 
fication o\er  a  very  wide  range  of  periods.  Also,  the 
peak  spectral  ratios  were  considerably  greater  than  the 
peak  amplitude  ratios  (particularly  on  Kagel  Mountain 
and  to  a  lesser  degree  at  Josephine  Peak).  Since  PSRV' 
amplitudes  are  dependent  on  the  duration  (number  of 
continuous  cycles)  of  motion  (I.ane,  1972),  this  is  an 
indication  of  longer  signal  duration  at  the  tops  of  the 
mountains  (longer  duration  is  ver\-  noticeable  on  the 
Kagel  Mountain  seismograms — see  figure  6).  The 
longer  duration  could  be  caused  by  resonance  of  the 
mountain  or  could  be  the  effects  of  bod\'-\\ave  re- 
flection and  refraction  within  the  mountain. 


Kagel  Mountain 

At  Kagel  Mountain  the  north /south  component 
spectral  amplitudes  at  the  crest  arc  more  than  10  times 
greater  than  at  the  base  for  periods  between  0.2  and 
1.0  second  and  20  to  as  much  as  30  times  greater  at 
periods  around  0.4  to  0.5  second  (sec  figure  4).  Ratios 
of  the  vertical-component  spectra  are  less  consistent 
than  the  horizontal  north/south  and  generally  show 
much  less  amplification. 

Comparisons  of  the  velocit\'  seismograms  recorded 
at  the  crest  and  base  from  .Xftershock  A  are  shown  in 
figure  6.  The  seismometers  were  oriented  in  the  north/ 
south  direction  (transverse  with  respect  to  the  direc- 
tion to  the  epicenter).  There  is  a  ver\-  noticeable  dif- 
ference in  the  duration  and  amplitude  of  the  shear 
waves.  The  shear  waves  on  the  crest  exhibit  many 
more  cycles  of  motion  and  larger  amplitudes  than  the 
base.  It  is  possible  that  the  mountain  was  excited  at 
the  resonant  period  b\-  the  shear-wave  motion.  Assum- 
ing a  10,000  ft/sec  velocit\-  for  the  shear  waves  and 
using  a  0.5  second  period  (which  is  where  peak  ampli- 
fication occurs),  a  wave  length  of  5000  feet  is  obtained, 
which  coincides  with  the  half  width  of  Kagel  Moun- 
tain. So  it  appears  feasible  for  the  shear  waves  to  cause 
resonance,  because  the  \\  ave  lengths  are  comparable  to 
the  dimensions  of  the  mountain. 

Peak  vclocit\'  amplitudes  at  the  crest  are  about  2  to 
4  times  larger  than  those  at  the  base,  but  it  can  be  seen 
(figure  6)  that  the  later  part  of  the  shear  wave  arrival 
is  many  times  larger  at  the  crest  than  at  the  base.  The 
amplification  in  the  time  domain  in  this  part  of  the 
record  is  comparable  to  that  seen  in  the  frequency 
domain. 

Josephine  Peak 

The  Josephine  Peak  spectral-ratio  data  show  ampli- 
fication over  a  broader  range  of  periods  than  w'as  ob- 
served at  Kagel  .Mountain.  The  ratios  of  the  horizontal 
component  PSRV  spectra  tend  to  peak  at  periods  of 
about  0.15  second,  0.2  to  0.3  second,  and  1.5  to  2.0 
seconds.  The  amount  of  amplification  is  roughly  the 
same  at  each  of  three  period  ranges  and  is  a  factor  of 
about  3  for  the  north/south  component  and  about  5 
for  the  east/west  component.  As  noted  at  Kagel 
Mountain,  the  ratios  of  the  vertical  components  show- 
less  amplification  than  the  horizontal  components. 

North/south  component  vclocit\'  seismograms  re- 
corded at  the  crest  and  at  the  base  of  Josephine  Peak 
from  Aftershock  D  are  shown  on  figure  7.  The  north/ 
south  direction  is  approximately  transverse  with  re- 
spect to  the  direction  to  the  epicenter.  It  is  seen  that 
the  amplitude  at  the  crest  is  greater  than  at  the  base 
over  much  of  the  seismogram.  The  difference  in  peak 
velocity-  amplitudes  is  a  factor  of  about  2.  The  distinct 
difference  in  shear-\\'ave  duration  that  was  observed  at 
Kagel  Mountain  is  not  noticeable  at  all  at  Josephine 
Peak.  Evidently  there  was  shear  wave  amplification, 
but  the  dimensions  of  the  mountain  relative  to  the  in- 
coming wave  lengths  were  not  closch'  enough  matched 
to  produce  the  type  of  amplification  seen  at  Kagel 
Mountain.  There  is  amplification  in  the  longer  period 
(1.5  to  2.0  seconds)  range,  which  was  not  observed  at 
the  smaller  mountain.  This  would  be  expected  because 
the  larger  mountain  should  affect  the  longer  periods.

Again,  assuming  that  the  shear-wave  vclocit\'  is  around 
10,000  ft/sec  (\\hich  means  tlic  surface-wave  velocity 
is  roughlv  9000  ft/sec),  the  wave  length  at  a  period  of 
1.5  seconds  is  13,500  feet,  which  is  about  the  half 
width  of  Josephine  Peak  (12,000  feet). 

SUMMARY 
The  data  collected  at  Kagel  Mountain  and  Jose- 
phine Peak  indicate  that  seismic  signals  can  be  signifi- 
cantly affected  by  topography.  This  observation  is 
important  in  terms  of  the  seismic  safety  of  facilities 
built  on  topographic  prominences.  The  widely  ac- 
cepted belief  that  structures  built  on  hardrock  arc  less 
susceptible  to  damaging  ground  motion  than  those  on 
unconsolidated  materials  could  be  a  misleading  general- 
ization; that  is,  selecting  a  hardrock  site  on  a  mountain 


rather  than  an  alluvium  site  in  a  valley  might  not  im- 
prove, and  might  even  worsen,  the  seismic  risk  to  the 
facility-.  The  largest  amplification  of  motion  at  the 
crests  of  these  mountains  (relative  to  the  base)  is  as 
large  or  larger  than  the  amplification  normally  caused 
bv  the  presence  of  near-surface  unconsolidated  layers. 
The  amount  of  amplification  and  the  periods  at 
which  it  occurs  vary  with  the  size  of  the  mountain 
and  are  probabl\-  a  function  of  the  relationship  be- 
tween the  wave  lengths  of  the  incoming  signal  and 
the  dimensions  of  the  mountain.  While  there  is  some 
correlation  noted  between  the  amplification  and  the 
half  width  of  the  mountain,  it  is  not  clear  that  this 
dimension  is  necessarily  the  important  one.  Other  di- 
mensions, such  as  height,  slope,  general  shape,  etc., 
might  also  be  important  factors.

CHAPTER  24 
Eorthquoke  Risk  in  Relation  to  Earthquake  Characteristics  ' 

by  Bruce  A.  Bolt    ' 


MAGNITUDE  AND  INTENSITY 

The  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971, 
is  of  considerable  interest  because  of  its  unusually  high 
intensity-  along  the  southern  foothills  of  the  San  Ga- 
briel Mountains  and  in  the  northern  San  Fernando 
Valley  (see  figure  1).  The  peak  accelerations  of  the 
earthquake,  recorded  at  Pacoima  Dam,  reached  1  '/4  g 
horizontally  (Trifunic  and  Hudson,  1971).  Accelera- 
tions greater  than  0.2  g  were  measured  at  five  sites 
within  30  km  of  the  epicenter.  In  her  paper,  Scott 
(1971)  assigned  a  ma.ximum  Modified  .Mcrcalli  intens- 
ity of  VIII-XI  to  the  San  Fernando  and  Sylmar  re- 
gions. The  Wood-Anderson  seismographs  of  the 
Berkeley  network  gave  a  mean  Richter  magnitude  of 
6.48  ±'  0.15  (Bolt  and  Gopalakrishnan,  1972).  The 
high  values  for  peak  acceleration  and  intensity  for  an 
earthquake  of  this  moderate  magnitude,  say  6.5,  caused 
some  surprise  among  e.xperts. 

In  order  to  assess  the  strong  ground  motion  involved 
in  an  earthquake,  seismologists  and  engineers  have  long 
sought  a  usable  empirical  relationship  between  magni- 
tude and  maximum  intensity.  A  number  of  empirical 
curves  exist,  but  there  are  many  exceptions  and  no 
agreed  form. 

In  this  earthquake,  like  that  of  April  18,  1906,  the 
hazard  to  life  and  propert\'  had  t^\'o  major  causes: 
ground  shaking  and  gross  ground  displacement  along 
the  ruptured  fault  segments  in  the  San  Fernando  Val- 
ley and  surrounding  hills.  Secondary  hazards  were 
from  landsliding  and  "avalanches". 

After  weighing  the  evidence,  it  seems  to  me  that  the 
amplitude  of  the  ground  shaking  in  parts  of  the  meizo- 
seismal  area  during  this  earthquake  was  about  as  ex- 
treme as  one  might  expect  in  earthquakes  of  even 
greater  magnitude.  The  magnitude  of  an  earthquake 
can  be  misleading  insofar  as  propensity  to  damage  and 
risk  to  life  is  concerned;  an  earthquake  model  for  risk 
evaluation  more  .satisfactory  than  magnitude  is  as  fol- 
lows: 

The  magnitude  of  a  shallow  earthquake  increases 
as  the  length  of  fault  rupture  associated  with  it  in- 
creases. In  other  words,  the  larger  the  magnitude,  the 
more  extensive  is  the  severe  shaking  along  the  fault 
zone.  So  far  as  intensity  of  shaking  near  the  fault 
rupture  is  concerned,  the  crucial  difference  between 
a  moderate  and  great  magnitude  earthquake  is  due  to 
the  longer  duration  of  strong  shaking  in  great  earth-

quakes.  The  farther  the  fault  rupture  propagates,  the 
longer  the  seismic  waves  which  arrive  at  any  site. 
.As  the  wave  train  continues  to  pass,  the  frequency 
spectrum  of  ground  motion  at  the  site  will  shift 
toward  low  frequency.  This  is  because  the  waves  of 
higher  frequency  attenuate  relatively  quickly  as  the 
distance  between  site  and  moving  rupture  increases. 

This  model  should  be  kept  in  mind  when  interpret- 
ing the  field  observations  in  this  paper.  It  is  consistent, 
incidentally,  with  the  main  effects  of  the  California 
earthquake  of  April  18,  1906.  The  Report  of  the  State 
Earthquake  Investigation  Commission  shows  a  Rossi- 
Forel  intensit)'  of  X  (the  highest  on  that  scale)  all 
along  the  ruptured  San  Andreas  fault.  As  Louderback 
(1942)  pointed  out,  however,  this  indicates  only  that 
the  fault  broke  the  surface;  structures  along  the  fault, 
such  as  ranch  houses,  were  usually  little  damaged  from 
shaking.  With  hindsight,  this  magnitude  8'/4  earth- 
quake can  be  said  to  have  produced  ma.ximum  Modi- 
fied Mercalli  intensity  of  IX  at  many  places  in  the 
coastal  region  from  San  Benito  Count\-  to  Humboldt 
County;  where  soil  properties  were  particularly  un- 
favorable to  shaking,  intensity  X  may  apply. 

GROUND  SHAKING 

There  was  much  damage  from  pure  ground  shaking 
in  the  San  Fernando  earthquake.  From  a  field  survey 
made  of  damaged  houses  in  the  meizoseismal  area 
(Bolt,  1971)  immediately  following  the  earthquake,  I 
conclude  that  ground  vibrations  (with  damaging  fre- 
quencies &gt;  Ic/s)  were  no  more  intense  along  the  zone 
of  thrust  faulting  in  San  Fernando  than  along  the 
foothills  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  in  the  vicinity 
of  Olive  View.  Man\-  wood-frame  dwellings,  for  ex- 
ample, in  both  areas  su.stained  little  or  no  structural 
damage.  Within  the  faulted  zone  in  San  Fernando,  it 
was  often  difficult  to  disentangle  shaking  damage  from 
that  due  to  shifted  foundations,  which  was,  for  many 
buildings,  the  more  probable  cause  (photo  11).  Cer- 
tainly the  rapid  decrease  in  building  damage  within  a 
t)lock  on  each  side  of  the  fault  offsets  was  striking, 
indicating  that  the  shaking  in  the  immediate  vicinity 
of  the  fault  was  not  as  severe  (see  photos  4,  12)  as  in 
other  parts  of  the  meizoseismal  region. 

Unfortunately  for  research  studies,  some  rock  and 
soil  foundation  conditions  were  not  represented  in  the 
meizoseismal  region.  For  example,  in  the  San  Fernando 
city  area,  surficial  soil  and  alluvium  remained  com- 
pacted; ground  water  played  a  rather  minor  role. 
Major  water-associated  features,  such  as  liquefaction,

lurching,  and  differential  settlement,  were  generally 
restricted  to  the  area  about  Sylniar  Juvenile  Hall  and 
Van  Norman  reservoirs. 

By-and-Iarge,  the  more  modern  dwellings  withstood 
shaking  without  loss  of  life  or  structural  damage. 
Wood-frame  houses  generally  survived  well  through- 
out the  area  of  strong  shaking  both  in  San  Fernando 
and  in  Sylmar  along  the  foothills.  Some  damaged 
houses  were  already-  deteriorated  with  age;  dry  rot  and 
termites  had  left  some  older  timber  structures  in  a 
weak  condition.  Some  \\ood-frame  houses  not  in  the 
fault  zone  shifted  on  or  off  their  foundations. 

The  strong  ground  shaking  caused  unusual  damage 
to  one  particular  design  of  split-level  house,  particu- 
larly those  in  the  new  housing  developments  of  the 
upper  Sylmar  area. 

Photo  1  shows  one  such  house.  The  garage  has  col- 
lapsed, pulling  the  second  story  away  from  the  first 
storw  The  large  door  area  in  the  garage  front  had 
replaced  shear  bracing  such  as  is  common  in  other 
types  of  two-story  dwellings.  Adequate  shear  bracing 
and  tiedowns  must  be  provided  even  if  there  are 
large  openings  in  the  structure.  The  type  of  sheathing 
on  garage  walls  in  these  houses  gave  little  shear 
strength. 

Some  older  brick  homes  collapsed  while  others  of 
reinforced  masonry  performed  well.  In  several  places, 
reinforced  block  construction,  usually  one  or  two 
stories  in  height,  survived  the  shaking  without  dam- 
age (see  photo  8). 

Photo  2  shows  the  backyard  of  a  particularly  well- 
built  modern  brick  house  in  the  faulted  zone  of  San 


Fernando.  The  damage  from  shaking  appeared  minor, 
although  loose  objects  inside  the  house  were  thrown 
down.  As  may  be  seen  in  photo  2,  the  light  roof  of  the 
patio  collapsed  and  the  air  conditioner  toppled  but 
chimne&gt;-  and  swimming  poo!  were  intact.  An  unusual 
hazard  to  life  was  noted  here:  the  severe  vibrations 
caused  \\ater  to  overtop  the  pool  and  inundate  a  base- 
ment room  which  \\as  used  as  a  bedroom.  Fortunately 
the  occupant  scrambled  to  safet_\'  in  the  darkness. 

While  the  brick  house  was  not  much  damaged  by 
shaking,  it  sustained  major  structural  fractures  from 
the  faulting  of  the  ground  beneath.  One  side  had 
broken  away  from  the  other  and  dropped  several  cms. 
A  wood-frame  house  would  probably  be  easier  to  re- 
pair. 

FAULTING 

The  earthquake  was  associated  with  major  thrust 
faulting  (photo  3)  along  the  edge  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  and  in  the  valley  floor,  which  broke  the 
ground  surface  more  or  less  continuously  for  at  least 
I5  km.  Although  the  ground  breakage  was  complex 
in  places,  the  principal  strike  Mas  nearly  east;  the  dip 
was  35°  to  55°  to  the  north  (Ronilla  et  al.,  1971). 

In  recent  years  great  emphasis  has  been  placed  by 
some  people  on  hazard  to  structures  built  straddling 
fault  zones.  Because  little  damage  has  occurred  his- 
torically in  this  way,  the  ground  breakage  through 
the  single-family  dwellings  of  San  Fernando  provides 
an  opportunity  to  examine  the  matter. 

In  the  flat-lying  San  Fernando  area,  even  in  the 
zone  of  greatest  ground  displacement  (about  1  m  ver- 
ticallv  and  1  m  laterally),  no  substantial  wood-frame

of  houses  in  the  area,  although  still  standing  after  the 
earthquake,  had  to  be  demolished;  and  many  more 
required    expensive    repairs.    It   is   a    traged&gt;"   that   no

scheme  of  insurance  for  geological  hazards  has  yet 
been  worked  out  which  gives  reasonable  coverage  for 
dwelling  damage  to  all  citizens. 

In  considerations  of  seismic  risk,  this  earthquake 
gives  an  illustration  of  extensive  tectonic  ground 
breakage  in  a  region  w^here  no  fault  was  drawn  on 
the  available  geologic  maps.  There  had  been  indirect 
evidence,  mainh'  based  on  ground  water  levels,  of  pos- 
sible faults  under  the  surface  of  the  valley  alluvium 
(Oakcshott.  IQ.'^R).  For  some  unknown  mechanical 
reason,  the  mapped  thrusts  along  the  base  of  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains,  such  as  the  Grapevine,  Hospital, 
and  I.opez  faults,  showed  no  surface  displacement 
after  this  earthquake. 

In  contrast  with  purel\-  strike-slip  faulting,  such  as 
on  the  San  .Andreas  in  1906,  when  little  en  echelon 
faulting  accompanied  the  main  break,  the  thrusting  in 
San  Fernando  produced  a  fractured  zone  up  to  200  m 
wide  in  places.  Compression  produced  specialized  and 
often  spectacular  damage,  for  example,  to  water  and 
gas  mains  (photo  14).  Effects  of  the  thrusting  were 
often  transferred  into  a  wider  area  by  the  works  of 
man.  Such  transfer  of  displacement  is  shown  in  photo 
^  taken  on  Orange  Grove  Avenue,  San  Fernando,  on 
the  da\-  of  the  earthquake.  The  concrete  slab  has  been 
ejected  from  the  space  between  the  slabs  below  it 
after  shortening  of  the  whole  cit\-  block  by  1.7  m.  A 
corresponding  piece  of  ejected  curbing  was  found  at 
the  other  end  of  the  block.

Hall  is  distinguished  by  broken  lines.  The  extreme 
damage  in  this  area  was  somewhat  different  from  that 
in  San  Fernando.  There  were  many  gravitational 
slides,  particularly  in  the  filled  land.  A  shallow  ground

Fault  thrusting   caused    by  shortening   of 


water  table  (less  than  2  m  down)  permitted  the  seismic 
shaking  to  produce  soil  liquefaction  phenomena: 
slumping,  lurching,  sand  boils  (see  Youd,  1971). 

M\'  original  impression  after  a  rapid  field  study  was 
that  there  was  also  evidence  of  tectonic  thrust  faulting 
with  some  left-lateral  displacement  under  this  zone. 
Some  of  this  evidence  is  as  follows:  First,  there  was 


a  linear  zone  of  ground  breakage  running  through  the 
Juvenile  facilit\-  across  Highway  5  and  Sepulveda 
Boulevard  through  Sylmar  Converter  Station  across 
the  top  of  Van  Norman  reservoir.  Left-lateral  dis- 
placement of  about  0.5  m  could  be  seen  clearly  along 
Sepulveda  Boulevard  and  along  a  concrete  canal  paral- 
lel to  it  (photo  6).  Secondh',  the  east-west  zone  of

either  by   underlying   tectonic   displacement  on  the  Mission   Hills  fault  or  by  on  extensive  landslide.

breakage  could  be  traced  westwards  into  the  new 
housing  dcxclopmcnts  along  the  foothills  north  of

evidence  for  undcrl\ing  tectonic  displacement.

ng    walls,    sidewalk,    and 


An  interpretation  in  terms  of  primary  tectonic  dis- 
location has  not  been  accepted  by  a  number  of  geolo- 
gists. Youd  (1971),  for  example,  prefers  to  interpret 
the  surface  fissures  completely  in  terms  of  a  large 
landslide  with  head  along  the  margin  of  the  hills  and 
toe  in  the  floor  of  the  Van  Norman  reservoirs.  This 
model  shows  slippage  on  a  liquefied  layer  of  sandy 
loam  along  a  gentle  slope  of  less  than  3°.  One  reason 
that  Youd  chose  this  interpretation  is  that  there  is 
change  from  left-lateral  to  right-lateral  slip  from  the 
southern  to  the  northern  part  of  the  disturbed  zone 
along  Sepulveda  Boulevard.  His  model  fails  to  explain 
left-lateral  displacements  northeast  of  Juvenile  Hall, 
greater  compression  of  Southern   Pacific  rail  tracks 


across  the  zone  than  of  the  imderlying  embankment, 
and  compressional  damage  and  Assuring  west  of  Bal- 
boa Boulexard.  The  elastic-rebound  theory  predicts 
that  greater  permanent  crustal  displacements  will  oc- 
cur in  tiic  zone  of  faulting  than  some  distance  away. 
My  preferred  model  is  that  some  thrusting  and  left- 
lateral  displacement  occurred  at  depth  along,  and  to 
the  south  of,  the  Olive  \'iew  fault.  The  surface  ex- 
pression of  this  primary  motion  was  complicated  and 
obscured  by  considerable  gravitational  sliding  made 
possible  by  decreased  shear  strength  of  wet,  near- 
surface  sand\'  sf)iis.  The  pattern  of  aftershocks,  which 
has  a  high  level  of  activit\-  north-south  through  the 
region  of  the  Highway  5  interchange,  gives  a  little 
support  for  this  model. 

ADEQUACY  OF  BUILDING  CODES 

An  important  lesson  from  this  earthquake  is  that 
significant  changes  in  structural  design  take  place  so 
gradually  over  the  vears  that  the  consequences  to  seis- 
mic risk  may  not  be  recognized. 

Clear  examples  concern  masonry,  the  modern  de- 
sign of  singlc-famil\-  wood-frame  houses  and  the  use 
of  reinforced  concrete  in  massive  structures.  This 
earthquake  demonstrated  that  \velI-constructed  con- 
crete block  structures,  unlike  much  older  brick  ma- 
sonry, have  high  seismic  resistance  (photo  8).  Of 
course,  if  built  straddling  tectonic  ruptures,  e\cn  mod- 
ern masonry  ma\"  be  heavily  fractured,  as  were  the 
concrete  pavements  across  the  thrusts  in  San  Fernando. 

As  alrcad&gt;'  mentioned,  some  modern  wood-frame 
houses,  presumal)l\-  built  to  code,  collapsed  in  this 
earthquake.  In  most  cases,  unlike  in  the  older  type 
of  house  with  relativeK'  small  windows  and  separate 
garage,  there  was  a  lack  of  shear  bracing  provided  in 
the  walls  on  the  ground  level  (usuall\-  the  garage — 
sec  photo  I).  Tiic  following  list  contains  a  number 
of  points  \\  hich  it  would  be  prudent  to  incorporate  in 
the  design  and  upkeep  of  wood-frame  houses  to  mini- 
mize seismic  damage. 

(a)  Exterior  sheathing  should  be  waterproof  ply- 
wood of  -pr  inch  minimum  thickness  adequately 
nailed.  Because  garage  doors  and  large  windows  pre- 
sent special  hazards,  such  additional  internal  bracing 
as  pl\\vood  sheathing  should  be  used. 

(b)  Internal  lighting  fixtures  and  utilit\'  equipment 
(water  heaters,  refrigerators,  wall  stoves)  should  be 
fastened  to  structural  elements  securel)'  enough  to 
withstand  accelerations  in  excess  of  0.5  g  (photo  9). 

(c)  Masonry  chimneys  should  be  adequately  rein- 
forced and  braced  to  structural  elements  to  prevent 
collapse  into  the  living  area  (photo  10),  or  light- 
weight flues  should  be  used.  Reinforcing  using  4  rods 
of  vertical  steel  docs  not  provide  sufficient  safety  in 
iiigh  earthquake-risk  zones. 

(d)  The  frame  and  sill  plates  should  be  inspected 
periodicall\-  to  assure  that  the  wood  structure  built 
to  resist  lateral  forces  and  tied  to  concrete  founda- 
tions has  not  been  damaged  by  termites  or  fungus. 

(e)  Since  concrete-block  walls  in  gardens  often  col- 
lapse during  seismic  shaking,  all  concrete-block  walls 
should  be  tied  to  adequate  footings.

Finall\-,  the  failure  of  the  psychiatric  A\-ard  at  Olive 
\^ie\\'  Hospital  and  the  heav\-  damage  of  the  main 
facility'  is  a  very  disturbing  commentary  on  the  ade- 
quac\'  of  building  codes.  The  thrust  mechanism  of 
this  earthquake,  which  had  greater  vertical  accelera- 
tions than  any  previously  recorded  in  California,  prob- 
ably was  a  factor  in  causing  the  great  amount  of 
damage.  A  committee  of  the  Structural  Engineers  .\s- 
sociation  of  Southern  California  has  given  its  opinion 
"that  the  lateral-force  design  of  the  two  structures 
generalh-  complied  with  the  building  codes  in  exist- 
ence at  the  time.  Failures  in  both  units  occurred  in 
columns  due  to  increases  in  \ertical  loads  as  a  result 
of  vertical  accelerations  of  the  ground  and  high  lateral 
accelerations  causing  severe  shear  and  bending 
stresses." 

The  Olive  View  buildings  were  reinforced  con- 
crete; it  would  appear  that  evaluation  of  the  design 
of  reinforced  concrete  structures  is  subject  to  con- 
siderable uncertaint\-  at  the  present  time.  The  need 
for  continuous  reworking  of  earthquake  design  codes 
suggests  that,  \\hilc  the  members  of  the  engineering 
profession  must  take  a  central  place  in  such  considera- 
tions, it  would  be  ad\antageous  to  associate  seismolo- 
gists, geologists,  and  other  interested  professionals. 

SITE  EVALUATION 

Stud\"  of  the  earthquake  emphasizes  the  great  im- 
portance of  adequate  site  evaluation  for  structures  in 
an  earthquake-prone  area.  The  concept  is  familiar  to 
a  small  number  of  seismologists,  engineers,  geologists, 
and  planners;  but  there  is  a  need  to  have  it  accepted 
more  wideU".

For  many  years,  rhc  Atomic  Encrg\-  Commission 
has  required  the  sites  of  proposed  nuclear  power  reac- 
tors to  be  evaluated  thoroughly  for  seismic  hazards 
(Fischer  and  Murphy,  1970).  Consultants  from  the 
disciplines  of  geology,  seismology,  soils  engineering, 
and  structural  engineering  carr\'  out  the  assessment. 

There  are  two  main  situations.  First,  for  major 
structures  with  a  high  level  of  human  occupancy  or 
w  ith  long  life  expectation  in  regions  where  great  earth- 
(]uakes  have  occurred  and  the  seismicit\'  is  high,  there 
is  no  need  to  introduce  the  detailed  probahilit\-  as- 
pects of  earthquake  occurrence.  The  assumption  can 
he  made  from  the  outset  that  the  structure  must  sus- 
tain without  danger  of  collapse  the  greatest  earth- 
(]uake  intensit\-  mechanicalK-  feasible  at  the  site.  From 
a  study  of  the  historical  seismicity,  a  .seismologist  can 
estimate  this  maximum  intensity  of  shaking  on  firm 
ground  near  the  site.  After  allowance  for  an\-  modifi- 
cation of  the  intensit\-  at  the  actual  site  bv  the  soils, 
the  ground  acceleration  can  then  be  estimated.  Specifi- 
cation of  acceleration  levels  as  a  function  of  frequency 
and  the  duration  of  strong  shaking  define  a  design 
earthquake  for  the  site  in  question. 

The  second  situation  arises  when  large  earthquakes 
arc  known  historicalK-  but  are  ver\'  infrequent.  Assess- 
ment of  site  response  alone  is  no  longer  sufficient.  Tn 
terms  of  prohabilit\',  there  is  low  seismic  risk  because 
the  time  betw  een  damaging  earthquakes  is  very  long. 
(In  the  case  of  the  St.  Lawrence  Sea\\a\-,  perhaps  sev- 
eral centuries.)  The  analysis  requires  a  treatment  in 
terms  of  probability.  For  example,  if  a  return  period 
of  one  hundred  \'ears  is  selected  as  tolerable  to  the 
owner,  communitx',  and  users,  then  the  design  earth- 
quake would  have  as  its  peak  acceleration  that  \\hich 
might  be  expected  of  an  earthquake  with  a  probabilitN' 
of  one  in  one  hundred  \ears.  Of  course,  economic 
and  social  factors,  as  well  as  building  use,  will  change 
the  acceptable  odds. 

The  \'eterans'  Administration  faces  botii  situations 
describeil  above.  Its  hospitals,  of  many  designs  and 
ages,  are  located  in  mam  states,  each  in  a  different 
tectonic  envirouTuent.  .After  the  tragic  collapse  of 
some  of  the  hospital  buildincs  at  Sylmar  during  the 
Februar\    earth(]uakc,  the  Administration  took  action 


to  stud\-  the  oxerall  situation  (see  Rolt,  1971b).  A  spe- 
cial "F,arth(]uake  and  \\'ind  Ff)rces  Committee"*  was 
set  up  in  .Xpril  1971.  The  principal  objectives  were  to 
review  and  revise  building  codes  for  future  VA  design 
and  to  prepare  guidelines  for  the  estimation  of  risk 
for  present  hospitals.  Site  evaluation  is  clearly  of  criti- 
cal importance  in  both  cases. 

ASSESSMENT  OF  INTENSITY  IN  THE  FAULTED  AREA 
From  the  field  stud\-  that  began  on  the  morning  of 
the  earthquake.  Dr.  Robin  .Xdams,  who  is  familiar 
with  intensit\-  assessments  in  New  Zealand,  and  I  con- 
cluded that  the  highest  Modified  Mercalli  intensity 
reached  in  San  Fernando  was  IX  with  a  few  restricted 
areas  of  X  in  S\lmar.

across  Orange  Grove  Avenue,  San  Fernando.  Wood-frame  house 
straddles  faulting  in  street  and  curbing.  Note  chimney,  air  conditioner, 
and  TV  antenna  in  place. 


To  recapitulate,  grade  IX:  "General  panic.  Ma- 
sonr\'**  D  destro\ed;  masonry  C  heavily  damaged, 
sometimes  with  complete  collapse;  iuasonr\-  B  seriously 
damaged.  (General  damage  to  foundations.)  Frame 
structures,  if  not  bolted,  shifted  off  foundations. 
Frames  racked.  Serious  damage  to  reservoirs.  Under- 
ground pipes  broken.  Conspicuous  cracks  in  ground. 
In  alluviated  areas,  sand  and  mud  ejected,  earthquake 
fountains,  and  craters." 

It  is  difficult  to  find  any  area  of  the  meizoseismal 
zone  in  which  this  description  was  exceeded.  Even  in 
the  zone  of  severe  thrust  faulting  in  San  Fernando, 
man\'  wood-frame  houses  survived  in  quite  surprising 
fashion  (photo  II — note  antennas  and  chimney  stand- 
ing). Thrust  fault  movement  was  responsible  for  se- 
vere damage  to  pavements  in  a  narrow  zone,  yet  struc- 
tures nearby  had  little  damage  to  foundations  and 
little  racking  of  frames  (photo  12).  There  are,  of 
course,  more  complexities  of  damage  and  felt  reports 
than  are  covered  by  the  present  Modified  Mercalli 
scale;  this  leads  to  marked  differences  in  assessing  the 
intensit\"  level.  The  variation  in  description  between

grades  IX  and  X,  given  the  present  building  condi- 
tions, makes  selection  difficult.  The  matter  would  not 
he  important  except  that  prediction  of  acceleration  in 
future  earthquakes  often  hinges  on  such  selections. 
The  time  is  overdue  for  a  careful  reconstruction  of 
the  Mercalli  Scale  as  used  in  California.  A  study  group 
from  the  relevant  disciplines  should  review  the  present 
scale  in  the  light  of  recent  California  earthquakes  and 
damage  to  various  types  of  structures. 

There  were  variations  in  intensity  over  short  dis- 
tances in  this  earthquake.  For  example,  damage  to 
homes  in  San  Fernando  within  a  block  of  the  thrust 
faulting  was  much  less  than  one  might  expect.  Near 
the  Pacoima  Dam,  where  accelerations  exceeding  1  g 
were  recorded,  the  brick  chimney  at  the  caretaker's 
cottage  did  not  fall! 

Airs.  Scott  (1971)  tentatively  assigned  maximum  in- 
tensity up  to  XI  to  a  small  area  of  the  San  Fernando 
foothills.  This  assignment  was  based  upon  (a)  failure 
of  the  Veterans'  Administration  hospital  and  the  Olive 
View  hospital  at  Sylmar,  (b)  major  damage  to  the 
\^an  Norman  Dam,  (c)  severe  damage  to  water  and 
power  facilities,  (d)  collapse  of  freeway  overcross- 
ings,  (e)  major  ground  rupture,  and  (f)  bending  of 
railroad  tracks.  Grade  X  would  appear  to  cover  (a), 
(b),  (c),  (d),  and  (e)  adequately.  Grade  XI  has  a 
short  and  limited  definition:  "Rails  bent  greatly.  Un- 
derground pipelines  completely  out  of  service."  Of 
the  many  miles  of  railroad  track  in  the  meizoseismal 
area,  there  was  great  distortion  only  in  a  few  hundred 
m  (for  example,  across  the  Sylmar  Juvenile  Hall 
ground  rupture). 

SOCIAL  BEHAVIOR 

On  our  field  inspection  in  San  Fernando  and  Sylmar 
after  the  earthquake.  Dr.  Adams  and  I  were  contin- 
ually impressed  by  the  generally  calm  response  of  the 
population.  Many  people  with  severely  damaged 
homes  moved  out  to  the  front  lawns  and  sat  there 
during  the  day  (see  photos  11  and  12).  During  the 
warm  night  of  February  9,  many  residents  slept  on 
the  lawns  and  in  cars.  Aftershocks  caused  concern; 


tiierc  were  reports  inter  of  children  being  disturbed 
in  behavior  by  the  continuing  shaking. 

A  major  contribution  to  the  excellent  community 
reaction  was  the  availabilit&gt;'  of  transistor  radios  in 
almost  ever\'  home.  Despite  failure  of  the  electrical 
SN'stem,  there  was  ne\er  a  time  in  which  the  popula- 
tion was  not  aware  of  the  general  situation.  Radio 
stations  devoted  much  of  February  9  to  discussions  of 
the  earthquake  and  the  wa&gt;-  in  which  problems  were 
being  met. 

The  lack  of  water  proved  to  be  not  too  much  of 
a  problem.  People  now  usually  have  a  good  reserve 
of  drinkable  materials  stored  and  in  refrigerators.  The 
request  for  the  people  to  sta\-  out  of  the  damaged  area 
seemed  to  he  generalK'  followed  on  the  morning  of 
the  earthquake.  There  was  very  little  activit)'  on  the 
roads  throughout  the  area.  One  could  drive  with  con- 
siderable ease  through  San  Fernando.  It  was  not  until 
some  days  later  that  sightseers  started  to  come.  They 
were  not  greeted  with  very  much  warmth. 

The  experience  of  this  earthquake  reinforced  the 
need  to  maintain  certain  basic  equipment  in  homes  in 
earthquake  areas:  portable  fire  extinguishers,  a  first 
aid  kit,  and  a  transistor  radio. 

TYPE  OF  EARTHQUAKE  IN  RELATION  TO  HAZARD 

Loss  in  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  emphasized 
the  need  for  a  more  sophisticated  conception  of  earth- 
quake risk.  Histf)rical  world-wide  evidence  using 
earthquake  effects  indicated  previously  that  earth- 
quake mechanisms  play  an  important  role  in  the  pat- 
tern of  ground  shaking.  Theoretical  seisniological 
models  were  defined  which  included  this  concept  (see 
Bolt,  1970,  p.  14);  but  no  detailed  quantitative  predic- 
tions of  intensity  as  functions  of  distance,  fault  type, 
and  geology  have  yet  been  worked  out.  Earthquakes 
associated  with  transcurrent  rupture  of  the  San  An- 
dreas fault,  such  as  the  April  18,  1906,  earthquake  and 
the  Imperial  Valley  1940  shock,  should  not  be  used  to 
develop  universal  models  of  ground  shaking  and  in- 
tensity. 

In  the  1952  Kern  County  earthquakes,  both  left- 
lateral  and  reverse  dip-slip  motion  occurred  on  the 
White  Wolf  fault.  In  the  1971  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake, the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  were  thrust  to  the 
south  over  the  valley.  Faulting  dynamics  with  a  sub- 
stantial vertical  component  of  slip  lead  to  special 
ground  response  of  both  theoretical  and  practical  im- 
portance. Along  the  San  Fernando  thrust  fault  zone, 
the  breadth  of  the  broken  ground  due  to  the  faulting 
was  generall\-  greater  than  along  much  of  the  1906 
San  Andreas  transcurrent  rupture.  In  many  places  en 
echelon  fissures  developed  in  the  1971  faulting  over 
a  200  m  wide  belt.  Thrusting  and  left-lateral  offsets 
caused  up-buckling  and  rotation  of  the  ground.  This 
vertical  distortion  led  to  particularK'  serious  disloca- 
tions in  road  pavements  (photo  13)  with  attendant 
increase  of  risk  from  lack  of  access.  Tectonic  com- 
pression caused  severe  damage  to  underground  utility 
systems  (photo  14). 

Finally,  the  thrusting  mechanism  produced  a  dif- 
ferent frequency  spectrum  of  ground  shaking  than 
previously  noted.  Instrumental  measurements  at  Pa-

cninia  Dam,  for  example,  on  the  southern  edge  of  the 
upthrust  block  show  peak  vertical  accelerations  of

sistent with  the  type  of  damage  to  such  buildings  as

through  the  concrete  basement  roof.  Sustained  vertical 
accelerations,  on  the  other  iiand,  are  not  likely  to 
produce  as  spectacular  failures  as  lateral  shaking  in 
structures  with  small  shear  strength.  Thus,  the  vertical 
portion  of  the  siiaking  in  the  San  Fernando  and  Syl-

much  damage  to  trees,  utilit\-  poles,  chimneys,  roof 
fixtures,  or  wooden  frames.

CHAPTER  25 

Building  Damage  in  San  Fernando  Valley  ' 

by  Karl  V.  Steinbrugge,'  Eugene  E.  Schader,^  Donald  F.  Moron  * 


ABSTRACT 

Objectives  of  this  paper  are  to  review  the  most  im- 
portant building-damage  information  and  to  analyze  rela- 
tionships of  damage  to  soils  and  geology. 

The  Los  Angeles  County  Coroner's  Office  reported  58 
deaths  directly  attributable  to  the  February  9  earth- 
quake out  of  a  current  population  of  7,032,000.  Total 
loss  to  buildings  and  structures  has  been  estimated  at 
$511,000,000. 

Highest  acceleration  ever  recorded  in  an  earthquake 
v/as  recorded  at  Pacoima  Dam  during  this  earthquake.  The 
fracturing  of  the  rock  during  the  earthquake  and  the  in- 
strument's location  on  an  outcrop  of  crystalline  rock  at 
the  dam  may  have  significantly  influenced  the  recording 
with  respect  to  unfractured  rock.  Duration  of  strong  motion 
was  about  12  seconds. 

The  number  of  buildings  astride  the  fault  trace  were 
few  compared  to  the  total  number  of  buildings  in  the 
vicinity,  but  those  on  the  trace  were  severely  damaged. 

About  25  percent  of  ail  dwellings  in  the  hardest-hit 
area  had  losses  over  5  percent  of  value.  This  represents 
1  percent  of  ail  the  dwellings  in  the  San  Fernando  Valley 
considered  in  this  study.  There  was  no  noticeable  difference 
between  the  performance  of  concrete-slab  floors  and  wood- 
joist  floors.  One-story  dwellings  performed  substantially 
better  than  two-story  dwellings  and  much  better  than  com- 
bination one-and-two-story  dwellings.  Modern  dwellings 
performed  better  than  older  ones.  Calculated  average  loss 
for  all  dwellings  is  6.6  percent.  Steel-frame  and  reinforced- 
concrete  highrise  buildings  generally  performed  well. 

Two  zones  of  higher-than-average  dwelling  damage 
exist:  one  contiguous  with  the  zone  of  faulting  in  the  valley, 
and  the  other  along  the  base  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains. There  may  be  a  relationship  between  the  alluvial 
soils  and  sedimentary  strata  and  the  firmer  rock  of  the 
foothills. 

Detailed  instrumental  and  theoretical  studies  of  the 
dynamic  properties  of  soils  and  stratified  sedimentary  for- 
mations, particularly  varying  thickness  of  alluvial  materials 
on  irregular  bedrock  surfaces,  must  be  given  high  research 
priority.

The  objectives  of  this  paper  are  to  review  the 
most  important  building  damage  information  gathered 
by  the  authors  and  their  analysis  of  it  and  to  analyze 
the  geographic  distribution  of  damage  in  order  to  de- 
termine the  relationship  of  damage  to  surficial  soils  and 
geology. 

One  of  the  two  principal  resources  used  is  the  in- 
surance-oriented report  "San  Fernando  Earthquake, 
February  9,  1971",  by  Steinbrugge,  Schader,  Biggie- 
stone,  and  Weers,  and  its  back-up  information;  major 
condensations  of  it  are  included  in  this  study.  The  sec- 
ond resource  consisted  of  the  substantial  amount  of 
information  made  available  from  the  forthcoming  de- 
finitive engineering  volumes  being  prepared  by  the 
Earthquake  Engineering  Research  Institute  (EERI)  in 
cooperation  with  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmos- 
pheric Administration  (NOAA),  Department  of  Com- 
merce. Both  these  publications  will  be  very  useful  for 
persons  wishing  to  study  the  more  detailed  data  upon 
which  this  paper  is  based,  since  we  cannot  here  discuss 
damage  to  numerous  important  structures  and  struc- 
tural types,  such  as  the  Sylmar  Converter  Station,  Syl- 
mar  Juvenile  Hall  facilities,  and  older  non-earthquake- 
resistive  brick  buildings. 

The  Area  of  Heaviest  Shaking 

The  region  that  was  most  heavily  shaken  is  in  the 
northern  suburbs  of  the  city  of  Los  Angeles  and  in 
the  adjacent  small  communities.  Figure  1  shows  the 
distance  between  the  earthquake's  epicenter  and  the 
population  centers. 

For  the  purposes  of  this  report,  the  heavily  shaken 
area  of  San  Fernando  Valley  is  defined  by  the  outer 
geographic  boundaries  shown  in  figure  2,  although  the 
discussion  of  damage  will  include  other  areas.  The 
northern  limits  are  bounded  by  the  base  of  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains.  However,  there  were  areas  of 
moderate  damage  to  newer  structures  north  of  this 
limit  near  Solemint  Junction,  Newhall,  and  Saugus. 
Southern  limits  are  bounded  by  the  Santa  Monica 
Mountains  and  by  the  Los  Angeles  River  at  the  foot 
of  the  mountains.  The  eastern  limits  generally  follow 
the  Verdugo  Mountains,  part  of  the  San  Gabriel 
range.  The  western  limits  are  the  topographic  changes 
in  elevation  of  the  Santa  Susana  Mountains  and  the 
Simi  Hills. 

The  Valley  is  now  primarily  a  residential  area  as 
agriculture  has  been  phased  out.  Businesses  serving  the 
communities  are  concentrated  along  the  major  thor- 
oughfares. Light  industrial  construction  has  grown  in 
the  post-World  War  II  period.  Most  manufacturing 
plants  are  located  along  the  two  railroads.

and  its  relationship  to  southern  California  cities. 


The  City  of  San  Fernando,  incorporated  in  1911, 
is  an  enclave  within  the  City  of  Los  Angeles.  San  Fer- 
nando's  one  principal  business  district,  which  is  along 
San  Fernando  Road  (formerly  Porter  Avenue),  has 
brick  masonry  construction  of  the  old  buildings  vcr)' 
much  in  evidence.  The  brick  structures,  built  prior  to 
the  earthquake-resistant  design  requirements  of  the 
present  building  codes,  used  the  poor  quality  sand- 
lime  mortar  that  was  standard  at  the  time.  Buildings 
for  several  blocks  along  Maclay  Avenue  northeast  of 
San  Fernando  Road  also  represent  the  earlier  period 
of  the  city.  The  older  dwellings  that  surround  this 
early  business  district  were  those  that,  in  general,  were 
the  most  severely  damaged  by  the  earthquake. 

Mission  San  Fernando  Rey  de  Espana,  seventeenth 
in  the  chain  of  California  missions,  is  in  the  city  of 
Los  Angeles  and  slightly  beyond  the  southern  limits  of 
the  City  of  San  Fernando.  Built  originally  in  1806,  the 
mission  chapel  was  first  damaged  by  the  1812  earth- 
quake. The  February  9,  1971,  earthquake  severely 
damaged  the  thick  adobe-walled  chapel  (photo  1)  of 
the  Mission  and  cracked  the  white-washed  arches  of 
the  Convento  Building  along  Mission  Boulevard.  The 
fate  of  the  chapel  has  not  &gt;'et  been  decided;  however, 
efforts  to  reinforce  the  Convento  Building  are  under- 
way. Although  damaged,  the  Mission  stood  slightly 
more  than  1  mile  from  the  heavily  damaged  Lower  San 
Fernando  Dam  and  about  half  a  mile  from  the  severely 
damaged  Holy  Cross  Hospital  without  collapsing.

ally   built  in  about  1806. 

Most  of  the  other  d\\ellings  within  the  valley  are 
post-World  War  II.  Construction  is  mainly  wood 
frame  and  stucco  with  some  brick  and  stone  veneer  on 
the  front  lower  half  of  some  dwellings.  Dwellings 
throughout  the  valley  showed  minor  interior  cracking, 
mostly  in  the  older  plastered  interiors.  Also,  chimneys 
made  of  brick  and  unreinforced  concrete  in  some  of 
the  older  buildings  were  broken. 

The  heavily  hit  area  of  San  Fernando  Valley  had 
a  population  of  1,284,200  in  1970  within  the  289  square 
miles  outlined  in  figure  2.  If  we  include  the  duplex 
units  as  one-unit  structures,  302,619  dwellings  (one- 
unit  structures)  exist  within  the  area  outlined. 

Life  Loss  and  Injuries 

The  Los  Angeles  County  Coroner's  Office  re- 
ported 58  deaths  (table  1)  directly  attributable  to  the 
February  9  earthquake  out  of  a  current  population 
of  7,032,000.  The  collapses  at  the  Veterans  Administra-

tion  Hospital  in  the  foothills  of  San  Fernando  Valley 
immediately  claimed  41  lives;  six  died  later  as  a  result 
of  injuries  sustained.  This  was  the  largest  life  loss  at 
one  location  incident  to  the  earthquake.  Three  deaths 
occurred  at  Olive  X'^iew  Hospital;  one  due  to  falling 
building  materials  and  two  when  life-supporting  power 
supplies  failed.  One  person  died  in  the  roof  collapse  of 
the  old  brick  masonn*-  Midnight  Mission  (a  charitable 
facility)  in  downtown  Los  Angeles.  If  the  shock  had 
occurred  minutes  before  when  the  upper  dormitor\' 
area  was  fully  occupied,  the  death  toll  would  have 
been  greatly  increased.  The  person  who  died  had  left 
the  building  but  was  standing  in  front  of  it.  A  collaps- 
ing freeway  bridge  killed  two  men  when  their  truck 
was  crushed  under  a  fallen  span  in  the  heavily  shaken 
area  of  San  Fernando  Valley.  One  person  died  from  in- 
juries resulting  in  a  fall  from  the  freeway.  Four  deaths 
occurred  in  dwellings.  Heart  attacks  reportedly  took 
nine  lives;  however,  the  County  Coroner's  report  does 
not  list  these. 

Information  on  injuries  and  other  earthquake-re- 
lated emergency  cases  was  compiled  by  the  Hospital 
Council  of  Southern  California.  The  information  in  this 
paragraph  and  in  table  2  is  based  on  their  compilation 
from  replies  received  from  127  hospitals.  In  addition, 
the  Red  Cross  treated  the  minor  injuries  of  more  than 
3000  persons.

Dollar  Losses 

The  total  loss  to  buildings  and  structures,  exclud- 
ing land  and  building  contents,  has  been  estimated  by 
the  authors  at  $511  million;  a  breakdown  of  this  value 
is  given  in  table  3.  The  qualitv  of  the  $511  million 
estimate  is  only  fair,  and  probably  it  is  on  the  low  side. 

Undoubtedly,  incompatible  data  exist  in  the  back- 
up material  for  table  3.  Value  can  be  based  on  replace- 
ment value,  current  market  value,  or  assessed  value, 
among  others.  Loss  can  be  insured  loss  (a  dollar  de- 
ductible may  have  been  applied  before  the  loss  was 
paid),  loss  as  defined  by  the  cost  to  bring  the  structure 
back  to  its  original  (not  new)  condition,  and  loss  as 
defined  by  actual  repair  costs,  among  others.  These 
variables  in  definitions,  plus  political  and   emotional

celeradons  of  this  earthquake  were  the  highest  ever 
recorded,  being  104  percent  of  gravity  (iMaley  and 
Cloud,  1971)  for  the  greatest  single  pulse  with  a  num- 
ber of  other  peak  accelerations  being  in  the  50  percent 
to  75  percent  of  gravity  range.  Subsequently,  Trifunac 
and  Hudson  (1971)  have  reported  125  percent  of 
gravity  peaks  in  two  horizontal  directions. 

The  strongest  shaking  began  1  to  2  seconds  after 
the  instrument  started  to  record,  and  this  strongest 
shaking  lasted  for  about  8  seconds.  The  over-all  strong 
motion  lasted  about  12  seconds. 

The  instrument  was  located  on  a  rock  outcrop  at 
the  left  (south)  abutment  of  the  dam.  The  rock  around 
the  instrument  was  fractured  by  the  earthquake,  thus 
permanently  tilting  the  instrument's  foundation.  The 
fracturing  of  the  rock  during  the  earthquake  and  the 
instrument's  location  on  an  outcrop  may  have  signi- 
ficantly influenced  the  recording  with  respect  to  the 
unfractured  rock — probably  increasing  it — although 
this  cannot  be  proven.  The  12-second  duration  of 
strong  shaking  is  undoubtedly  correct.  It  is  interesting 
to  note  the  Pacoima  concrete-arch  dam  had  no  struc- 
tural impairments,  although  the  right  (north)  abut- 
ment was  found  to  be  slightly  more  than  1  inch  higher 
than  the  other  abutment  after  the  earthquake. 

The  significance  of  this  "highest-ever"  recording 
may  be  debated  for  years  to  come.  A  true  upper  limit 


of  horizontal  acceleration  of  75  percent  of  gravitv'  on 
unfractured  bedrock  for  this  earthqthike  does  not  seem 
unreasonable  to  the  authors  instead  of  104  percent  or 
125  percent  as  reported.  (There  undoubtedly  is  an  up- 
per limit  for  earthquakes,  but  such  a  limit  is  unknown.) 
This  reduced  value  is  reasonably  consistent  with  the 
authors'  observations  of  the  highly  intensified  damage 
found  along  the  nearby  base  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains: at  Olive  View  Hospital,  at  the  \^eterans  Admin- 
istration Hospital,  and  in  wood  frame  dwellings  be- 
t\veen  them. 

The  full  significance  of  the  high  horizontal  earth- 
quake accelerations  and  their  resulting  forces  becomes 
more  apparent  when  it  is  realized  that  modern  codes 
require  a  lateral  force  coefficient  of  13.3  percent  of 
gravity  for  the  conventional  one-stor\"  rigid  structures 
as  compared  to  the  possibly  75  percent  of  gravity 
actually  obscr\-ed.  With  factors  of  safet\-  against  major 
structural  damage  approaching  twice  the  13.3  percent 
value,  or  about  25  percent,  it  appears  that  the  actual 
forces  at  Pacoima  Dam  could  be  interpreted  as  being 
three  times  as  great  as  required  b\-  usual  good  practice 
as  based  on  code  requirements. 

The  reasoning,  though  incomplete,  presented  in 
the  previous  paragraph  could  readily  explain,  in  part, 
the  intensified  damage  found  at  Olive  \'iew  Hospital, 
the  \^eterans  Administration  Hospital,  and  in  wood

frame  dwellings  located  between  them.  However, 
extrapolation  is  not  entirely  satisfactory  since  the  band 
of  damage  along  the  base  of  the  San  Gabriel  Moun- 
tains containing  these  buildings  was  not  a  vcr\-  wide 
band.  The  band  of  damage  is  particularly  narrow  for 
single-family  wood  frame  dwellings.  It  has  been  ob- 
served in  some  other  earthquakes  that  accentuated 
damage  is  found  at  the  discontinuity  between  uncon- 
solidated alluvial  valley  soils  and  firmer  soils  (or  rock) 
in  the  foothills.  The  full  significance  of  this  band  of 
accentuated  damage  requires  much  more  study. 

To  summarize,  the  adequacy  of  present  lateral- 
force  code  values  for  buildings,  other  than  high-rise, 
may  be  insufficient  by  100  to  200  percent,  especially 
wherever  there  exists  the  potential  for  ground-dis- 
turbed areas  such  as  those  identified  in  the  San  Fer- 
nando earthquake.  This  condition  may  occur  more  fre- 
quently in  metropolitan  Los  Angeles,  particularly  in  its 
northern  section,  than  previously  believed.  Considering 
this,  the  code  cannot  everywhere  be  offered  as  a 
reasonable  "minimum"  for  safety. 

Vertical  accelerations.  In  addition  to  the  larger- 
than-anticipatcd  recorded  horizontal  accelerations  and 
forces,  substantial  vertical  forces  were  also  exerted. 
Examples  of  the  damage  resulting  from  vertical  accele- 
rations are  shown  in  the  section  discussing  Olive  View 
Hospital. 

The  authors  observed  "tossed  earth",  like  freshly 
disc-harrowed  land  prepared  for  planting,  on  the  top 
of  the  hills  just  north  of  Olive  View  Hospital.  This 
suggested  unusual  vertical  forces  in  addition  to  hori- 
zontal forces. 

Similar  evidences  of  vertical  earthquake  forces 
were  found  following  the  1969  Santa  Rosa  earthquake, 
among  others. 

Presently,  no  American  building  code  requires 
consideration  of  vertical  earthquake  forces  in  building 
design.  Certainly,  this  void  in  the  building  codes  must 
be  rectified. 

Soil  Conditions 

Earthquake  motions  are  often  substantially  modi- 
fied as  they  travel  from  bedrock  through  alluvial  soil 
to  a  building.  The  structural  characteristics  of  soils 
generally  tend  to  be  poor  throughout  the  San  Fer- 
nando Valley.  Earthquake  damage  relating  to  the  ap- 
parent amplification  of  seismic  motions  through  soil 
is  of  major  concern,  particularly  in  some  areas.  Also, 
damage  due  to  permanent  differential  settlements, 
lurching,  and  landslides  is  important.  Such  movements 
resulted  in  severe  damage  to  the  Jensen  Filtration 
Plant  and  to  the  Juvenile  Hall  facilities  in  Sylmar. 

Soil  conditions  at  specific  sites  arc  discussed  else- 
where in  this  paper.  Ho\\ever,  a  general  discussion, 
contributed  by  Herbert  J.  Rccker,  President  of  Pa- 
cific Soils  Engineering,  Inc.,  follows: 

The  valley  floor,  encompauing  some  160  squore  miles,  is 
relatively  flat  with  o  gentle  southeast  gradient.  Soil  of  the 
basin  is  olluvium  derived  from  the  parent  bedrock  of  the 
boundary  mountoin  system.  The  alluvium  ranges  in  composi- 
tion and  consistency  from  very  flne-groined,  highly  expansive 
clays  in  the  southern  port  of  the  valley  derived  from  marine 
shales  (Modelo  and  Topongo  Formotions)  of  the  Santa  Monica 
Mountains   to    the    very   coarse-grained    sand,    grovel,    cobble. 


ond  boulder  sediments  derived  from  the  granitic  rocks  of  the 
Son  Gabriel  and  Verdugo  Mountains  bounding  the  valley  on 
the  northeast.  The  alluvial  deposits  in  the  basin  exceed  a 
thousand  feet  in  thickness  and  range  from  soft,  wet,  and 
highly  compressible  materiol,  such  ai  is  found  in  oreos  to 
the  northwest  of  the  Sepulveda  Flood  Control  Basin,  to  the 
relatively  dense  sand,  gravel,  and  cobble  deposits  of  the 
north-central   valley  area   olong   the   old   Tujunga   flood   plain. 

Types  of  Building  Construction 

Building  sites  for  residential  construction  in  the 
valley  range  drastically  from  building  pads  developed 
on  natural  grade  or  in  shallow  cut  or  fill  throughout 
the  main  valley  floor  area  to  building  pads  created  by 
deep  cut  and  fill  grading  or  ovcr-the-slope  construc- 
tion in  the  hillside  areas  peripheral  to  the  valley  floor. 

Building  pads  on  natural  grade  or  in  shallow  cut 
and  fill  typicail)'  use  conventional  shallow  spread-type 
footings  having  nominal  reinforcement  except  where 
expansive  clay  soils  are  present.  Where  it  is  deter- 
mined that  expansive  clays  (fine-grained  soils  which, 
when  changed  in  moisture  content,  change  in  volume) 
are  present  in  the  foundation  system,  special  treatment 
is  required,  such  as:  deepening  of  footings,  use  of  ad- 
ditional reinforcement  in  both  floor  slabs  and  footings 
as  ^\■ell  as  use  of  granular  base  material,  and  moisture- 
barrier  membranes  beneath  the  house  floor-slabs. 

Where  building  pads  are  in  deep  cuts  or  are 
over-the-slope  construction  and  pads  may  consist  of 
engineered  compacted  fill  which  may  reach  a  thickness 
of  100  feet  or  more,  conventional  shallop-  spread  foot- 
ings, nominally  reinforced,  have  been  used. 

Construction  sites  for  industrial  and  commercial 
(high-rise)  buildings  are  primarily  in  the  main  valley 
area.  Soil  conditions  governing  the  design  of  footing 
systems  for  these  buildings  are,  as  discussed  above, 
quite  variable,  depending  on  the  locality.  As  a  general 
rule,  one-story  industrial  and  one-  to  three-story 
wood  frame  residential  (apartment)  structures  may  be 
satisfactorily  supported  on  conventional  spread  foot- 
ings with  some  sites  requiring  reprocessing  (excava- 
tion and  recompaction)  of  the  upper  few  feet  of  sur- 
face soils  in  order  to  maintain  footing  settlements 
within  tolerable  limits.  An  alternative  foundation 
treatment  economically  competitive  with  the  reproc- 
essing procedure  is  the  use  of  drilled  cast-in-place 
friction  piles  or  caissons. 

Faulting  and  Energy  Release 

The  geological  and  seismological  aspects  of  the 
earthquake  are  effectively  treated  by  the  authors  of 
the  companion  papers  in  this  volume.  However,  it  is 
of  value  to  re-examine  briefly  some  of  these  aspects 
from  an  engineering  viewpoint  as  it  relates  to  earth- 
quake-damage distribution. 

Figure  3  is  a  cross  section  drawn  looking  west 
through  the  faulted  region.  The  downtown  district  of 
the  city  of  San  Fernando  is  at  the  left  and  the  epicenter 
at  the  right.  Figure  3  is  the  authors'  simplified  and 
somewhat  idealized  interpretation  of  the  available  data. 

With  respect  to  figure  3,  the  earthquake's  energy 
is  stored  as  strain  energy  in  the  rock  around  the  fault 
plane.  Thus  the  earthquake's  energy,  which  causes  the 
vibrational  damage,  need  not  be  (and  usually  is  not) 
centered  beneath  the  epicenter  at  the  focus.  The  evi-

dence  available  to  date  suggests  that  the  centroid  of 
the  released  energy  volume  was  south  of  the  epicenter 
and  focus,  possibly  near  a  point  between  and  beneath 
locations  C  and  D  in  figure  3.  Under  these  assumptions, 
the  high  concentration  of  damage  between  points  B 
and  C  in  figure  5  becomes  more  meaningful  since  the 
structures  between  these  locations  are  much  closer  to 
the  earthquake's  energv  center  than  implied  by  the 
attention  given  only  to  the  epicentral  distance. 

The  actual  fault  movement  during  the  earthquake 
was  complex  and  differed  in  many  details  from  the 
thrust- fault  idealization  shown  in  figure  3.  The  move- 
ment also  had  a  left  lateral  component. 

The  number  of  buildings  astride  the  fault  trace 
were  few  compared  to  the  total  number  of  buildings 
in  the  vicinity,  but  buildings  on  the  fault  trace  usually 
are  severely  damaged.  Moreover,  building  damage  was 
more  extensive  than  expected  in  areas  north  of  the 


surface  faulting  when  compared  to  similar  buildings 
south  of  the  surface  faulting.  One  explanation  of  the 
greater  damage  north  of  the  surface  faulting  is  that 
the  upward  movement  in  this  area  resulted  in  severe 
vertical  forces  on  structures.  A  witness  at  Olive  View 
Hospital  reported  a  sharp  vertical  upward  movement 
as  the  first  sensation. 

Earthquake  Bracing  Systems 

The  amount  of  earthquake  damage  is  not  only  a 
function  of  the  building's  strength,  but  to  a  great  ex- 
tent it  is  a  function  of  the  design  methods  used  in 
achieving  the  required  strength.  A  brief,  simplified 
review  of  the  principal  bracing  systems  of  the  build- 
ings discussed  in  this  paper  follows: 

In  a  general  sense,  earthquake-bracing  for  all  types 
of  buildings  usually  may  be  divided  into  two  types: 
frame  action  (by  column  and  beam  bending)  and 
shear  walls  (by  bracing  walls).  A  combination  of 
these  may  exist.  Additionally,  there  are  other  variants, 
such  as  X-bracing  systems,  but  these  are  compara- 
tively few. 

Frame  action.  In  buildings  where  the  steel  or 
reinforced  concrete  frame  resists  earthquake  forces, 
the  columns  and  beams  resist  these  forces  in  bending 
as  may  be  seen  in  figure  4.  The  story-to-story  move- 
ment, or  story  drift,  may  be  as  much  as  inches  and 
still  not  overstress  the  columns  and  beams.  However, 
story  drifts,  which  normall\-  are  expected  to  occur 
in  an  earthquake,  will  shatter  floor-to-floor  partitions, 
continuous  elevator-shaft  and  stair  walls,  stairs,  plumb- 
ing, exterior  walls,  and  other  items  extending  bet\veen 
stories.  Therefore,  buildings  with  numerous  partitions.

such  as  hospitals,  hotels,  and  tiic  like,  can  have  substan- 
tial interior  and  exterior  damage,  possibly  approaching 
50  percent  of  building  value,  \ct  still  be  considered 
structurall)'  safe.  In  recent  _\ears,  increasing  attention 
has  been  given  to  damage  control  of  the  building's  out- 
side skin  features,  particularly'  glass  and  precast  con- 
crete facings,  but  not  to  the  interiors  including  stairs 
and  elevators. 

Shear  i;-.7//.f.  A  shear-wall  building  (figure  4)  is 
normally  quite  rigid  \\hcn  compared  to  a  framed 
structure  which  resists  earthquake  forces  by  bending. 
In  shear-wall  buildings,  the  earthquake  forces  are  re- 
sisted by  the  shear  walls  which  act  as  bracing  walls. 
Shear  walls  usually  are  of  reinforced  concrete  but 
ma\'  be  of  reinforced  grouted  brick  or  reinforced 
hollow  concrete  block.  The  entire  shear  wall  ma&gt;' 
rotate  if  the  soil  beneath  its  footings  is  relatively  soft, 
causing  localized  damage  around  the  wall.  With  low 
design-stress  limits  in  shear  walls,  deflection  due  to 
shearing  forces  is  negligible.  Shear-wall  construction 
is  an  excellent  method  of  bracing  buildings  to  limit 
their  damage,  and  this  t\'pc  of  construction  normally 
is  econoniicall\-  feasible  up  to  at  least  10  stories.  How- 
ever, the  architectural  and  functional  requirements 
must  also  be  tailored  to  the  concept  of  damage  con- 
trol and  repair.  Interior  shear  walls  placed  around  ele- 
vator equipment  cores  and  stairwells  are  compara- 
tively difficult  to  repair  and  may  interfere  \\-ith  func- 
tion and  occupancy  during  repair. 

The  one-stor&gt;'  light  industrial  buildings  in  the  San 
Fernando  area  arc  gcnerall\"  of  the  "box  system"  con- 
cept. Box  system  means  that  the  roof  and  the  exterior 
walls  are  intended  to  act  in  a  manner  similar  to  the 
top  and  sides  of  a  box  when  the  box  is  pushed  side- 
wa_\s.  The  pl\'\\'ood  roof  deck  (top  of  the  box),  there- 
fore, would  act  as  a  horizontal  diaphragm;  that  is, 
stressed  skin.  The  exterior  (and  interior)  unit  ma- 
sonry walls  or  tilt-up  concrete  walls  parallel  to  the 
direction  of  ground  motion  act  as  bracing  walls,  or 
"shear  walls".  Interior  columns  do  not  resist  any  sig- 
nificant amount  of  earthquake  force  in  the  box  system 
concept.  This  box  system  concept  for  earthquake  re- 
sistive design  is  quire  valid,  and  its  effectiveness  de- 
pends primarily  on  the  connections  bet\\  een  the  struc- 
tural elements.  The  size  and  number  of  openings  in 
an\'  shear  wall  are  of  major  concern  in  the  effective- 
ness of  this  svstcm. 

WOOD  FRAME  DWELLINGS 

Survey  of  Dwelling  Damage 

The  Pacific  Fire  Rating  Bureau  made  a  detailed 
study  of  the  damage  to  over  12,000  dwellings  through- 
out the  most  heavily  hit  area  of  San  Fernando  Valley. 
House-to-house  inspection  identified  location;  age; 
number  of  stories;  floor  construction;  degree  of  dam- 
age to  foundations,  \\ood  frame,  interior  finish  by 
type  of  finish,  exterior  finish  by  type  of  finish  (in- 
cluding veneer),  and  chimne\s;  ground  disturbance, 
including  faulting;  and  swimming  pool  damage,  among 
others. 

The  hardest-hit  regions  of  dwelling  damage  ex- 
tended from  upper  Granada  Hills  north  of  Rinaldi 
Street  on  the  west,  acrt)ss  the  \allc\-  to  the  east,  and 
up  into  the  San  Gabriel  foothills  and  Pacoima  Canyon 


in  S\lmar,  figure  2.  The  eastern  limits  extended  along 
the  foothills  into  Pacoima,  consistent  with  the  damage 
around  the  Pacoima  .Memorial  Lutheran  Hospital. 
However,  the  entire  survey  is  not  depicted  on  figure 
S.  .Mthough  there  was  damage  to  older  and  poorly 
constructed  dwellings  be&gt;ond  the  southern  survey 
limits  shown  on  figure  5,  the  benefits  from  extending 
the  detailed  inspections  southward  were  far  out- 
weighed b\-  the  meagerness  of  the  potentially  useful 
information. 

DzicUinsr  construction.  Dwelling  construction 
was  almost  universally  of  conventional  wood  frame. 
Exterior  wall  foundations  were  concrete  and  were 
continuous  for  the  exterior  stud  walls  of  newer  build- 
ings. Soil  throughout  the  inspected  areas  was  gen- 
erall\"  \\cak  alluvial  sand  and  gravel. 

\Vood-frame  dwelling  construction  in  southern 
California  has  mostly  follo\\-cd  two  distinct  patterns. 
One  pattern  is  platform  construction,  which  typically 
provides  a  continuous  concrete  foundation  at  the 
dwelling's  perimeter.  Interior  supports  for  this  sys- 
tem are  square  concrete  piers,  often  embedded  into 
the  ground  6  inches,  with  posts  and  girders  support- 
ing the  wood  floor  joist  s&gt;"stem  above.  A  wooden  sill 
bolted  onto  the  top  of  the  exterior  concrete  footing 
provides  nailing  for  a  crippled  stud  wall,  used  where 
the  lot  is  not  level.  Otherwise,  good  practice  would 
have  the  floor  joist  resting  on  the  bolted  sill,  blocked 
continuousl)',  and  with  diagonal  or  plywood  floor 
sheathing  providing  the  platform  surface  upon  which 
the  framing  is  erected. 

A  second  type  which  prevailed  more  often  was 
the  concrete  slab  on  grade  (that  is,  on  soil)  with  bolts 
embedded  into  the  monolithic  slab  footing  providing 
anchorage  for  a  treated  wood  sill. 

The  wood  framing  described  above  typically  fol- 
lowed the  Los  .Angeles  City  Code  Standard  Type  V 
sheet  derails.  Bolted  single  sill  plates,  vertical  studs 
16  inches  on  center,  and  double  top  plates  made  up 
the  structural  wall  system  with  a  standard  1-inch 
let-in  brace  at  each  corner  of  the  building  and  along 
every  25  lineal  feet  of  wall. 

Definitions  of  daviaire  by  construction  coiiipo- 
Ttevt.  The  inspectors  described  damage  to  the  various 
dwelling  construction  components  in  words.  The  fol- 
lowing  arc,  in  ver\-  summarx"  form,  examples  of  the 
damage  definitions  which  were  used  in  the  survey. 

With  respect  to  the  wood  frame,  building  distor- 
tions accompanied  by  a  separation  of  the  wood  frame 
from  its  foundation  or  portions  of  the  roof  or  walls 
distressed  to  a  point  of  incipient  failure  defined  the 
damage  as  severe.  .Minor  cracking  of  the  stucco  finish 
along  the  line  where  dissimilar  materials  joined  (such 
as  along  the  wood  sill  join  line)  was  assessed  as  slight 
damage  when  accompanied  b\-  minor  cracking  located 
diagonall&gt;-  at  window  corners.  Damage  appraised  to 
(]ualif\-  for  neither  slight  nor  severe  then  was  desig- 
nated moderate,  a  mid-range  qualification. 

Turning  to  another  example,  the  degrees  of  dam- 
age to  interior  plaster  and  g\psum  board  were  defined 
as  follows:  Severe  when  portions  of  the  plaster  were 
loose  or  had  fallen  as  a  result  of  extensive  cracking 
of  walls  or  ceiling  or  when  the  gypsum  board  (dry-

wall)  panels  required  replacement  or  retaping  of 
joints;  slifrht  when  old  cracks  enlarged  and  minor 
new  cracks  formed,  with  repair  involving  spackling 
of  plaster  or  puttying  of  gypsum  board  panels;  and 
moderate  when  damage  was  between  the  two  ex- 
tremes. 

Similar  definitions,  also  in  much  greater  detail, 
were  used  for  the  other  damage  descriptions  for  con- 
struction components.  Photos  2  through  8  show  exam- 
ples of  damage.

Analysis  of  Dwelling  Damage 

The  word  description  of  damage  to  a  construction 
component  (that  is,  exterior  finish,  etc.)  was  converted 
to  a  percentage  loss  for  the  entire  dwelling,  and  later 
a  percentage  loss  was  calculated  for  each  statistical 
area  outlined  on  the  map  (figure  5).  Then,  to  assess 
the  total  dollar  loss,  a  mean  value  of  the  dwellings 
within  each  statistical  block  was  calculated. 

The  cost  figures  were  broken  down  by  construc- 
tion component,  bv  building  value  (less  than  $20,000; 
120,000  to  130,000;  and  over  130,000),  and  by  period 
of  construction  (pre-1940,  1940-1949,  and  1949-pres- 
ent).  All  loss  values  exclude  the  value  of  the  land. 
Repair  costs  were  not  increased  by  earthquake  repair 
since  there  was  a  sufficiently  skilled  labor  pool  avail-

able  and  the  demands  on  construction  materials  did 
not  distort  local  markets — thereby  providing  loss  data 
of  good  quality  for  this  study. 


The  information  from  the  dwelling  damage  sur- 
vc\^  and  the  cost  data  were  computerized  with  the  fol- 
lowing results.  Since  the  area  selected  for  stud;.'  was 
within  the  most  heavily  shaken  area  and  the  area  of 
ground  disturbance,  the  loss  values  arc  probably  high. 

Distribution  of  damage  by  construction  covipo- 
iient.  Table  6  shows  the  percentage  of  the  total  num- 
ber of  the  wood-frame  dwellings  as  a  function  of  the 
type  of  damage.  There  were  more  reports  of  "no 
damage"  to  exterior  stucco  (plaster)  than  to  the  in- 
terior plaster  or  gypsum  board.  It  may  be  that  the 
homeowner,  wlio  normal!)'  accompanied  tiic  inspec- 
tor, was  familiar  with  the  interior  cracks  (new  or  pre- 
carthquakc)  whereas  he  may  not  have  noticed  exterior 
cracks.  Also,  repainting  interior  finishes  often  hides 
cracks  \\hicli  during  an  earthquake,  may  open  and 
close  slightly,  destroying  the  paint  bridge  although 
the  crack  may  not  have  lengthened.  This  "new"  crack 
is,  quite  appropriately,  new  damage,  even  though  paint 
within  the  crack  may  prove  its  pre-earthquake  exist- 
ence. Exteriors  are  less  subject  to  this  type  of  scrutiny.

•  Total  brick  chimney  damast  was  found  in  2.3 ^J  of  the  cases.  "Totir'  means 
exactly  that,  essentially  no  briclis  were  left  standing,  or  the  chimney  was  other- 
wise so  damaged  as  to  be  non-rcpairablc. 

Of  the  interior  finishes  in  table  6,  "severe"  and 
"moderate"  damage  occurred  to  plaster  nearly  twice 
as  often  as  to  gypsum  board. 

Brick  chimneys  (listed  also  in  tabic  6),  before  re- 
inforcing steel  was  used  in  their  construction,  were 
damaged  in  even  slight  shocks.  Had  chimneys  not 
been  "generally  reinforced,  the  "none"  value  would 
have  been  close  to  zero  instead  of  67.6  percent.  While 
the  present  standards  need  continued  improvement, 
the\'  were  impressive  in  reducing  losses. 

It  is  difficult  to  state  the  number  of  houses  which 
were  total  losses.  Certainly,  \\hcn  the  damage  ex- 
ceeded .50  percent  of  the  dwelling's  replacement  value, 
serious  consideration  should  have  been  given  to  re- 
placement. Serious  damage  to  the  frame  is  one  ex- 
cellent indicator;  this  study  found  217  dwellings  which 
had  severe  frame  damage  and  probabl\'  were  total 
losses  to  the  owners.  However,  other  interests  often 
came  in  later  to  salvage  and  repair  many  of  the  newer 
l)uildings.  Another  guide  to  total  losses  was  the  num- 
ber of  houses  condemned  by  the  City  authorities;  these 
numbers,  however,  are  based  on  inconsistent  data  and 
may  reflect  "instant  redevelopment"  by  governmental 
authorities.

PERCENTAGE   OF   DWELLINGS

VALUE  GIVEN   BY  CURVE 


Figure  6.      Percentage  of  loss  of  wood  frame  dw 


Masonry  veneer,  such  as  brick,  was  not  common. 
A  total  of  75.7  percent  of  the  dwellings  had  no  veneer 
while  22.6  percent  had  no  more  than  1  to  10  percent 
of  the  exterior  elevation  veneered.  Of  those  veneered, 
there  was  no  damage  or  only  slight  damage  to  94.5 
percent  of  the  structures. 

Most  of  the  446  swimming  pools  inspected  were 
along  the  foothills  where  much  heavier-than-normal 
dwelling  damage  was  found.  Shifting  sidewalks,  crack- 
ing in  street  paving,  and  disturbed  soil  were  common 
near  or  around  the  pools,  all  evidence  of  heavy  ground 
shaking.  Two  hundred  eleven  pools  had  no  damage; 
137  had  slight  damage;  19  had  moderate  damage;  and 
79  had  severe  damage.  The  amount  of  damage  ^^•as 
almost  invariably  related  to  the  amount  of  ground 
disturbance  around  the  pool. 

The  inspectors  were  asked  to  note  all  dwellings 
where  sidewalks  shifted  or  broke,  underground  utili- 
ties were  out,  or  the  soil  was  disturbed.  These  types  of 
evidence  were  found  in  10.1  percent  of  all  dwellings 
inspected.  It  is  reasonable  to  state  that  soil  disturbance 
resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in  damage. 

Vercenta^e  loss  deteiiii'matioTis.  Figure  6  shows 
the  results  of  the  determination  made  for  12,037  in- 
spected dwellings  in  the  hardest  hit  areas  contained  in 
figure  5.  The  data  in  figure  6  do  not  include  the  many 
thousands  of  cases  of  negligible-to-very-slight  damage 
— usually  far  less  than  5  percent  of  value — found 
throughout  much  of  eastern  San  Fernando  \'^alley;  nor 
does  it  include  the  extremcl\'  few  cases  of  damage 
which  exceeded  50  percent  throughout  this  same  area. 
In  figure  6,  the  data  for  losses  over  5  percent  are  of 
high  qualit\-  but  drop  off  quickK'  below  5  percent. 
Only  the  general  case  for  losses  of  less  than  5  percent 
has  been  plotted,  and  the  data  are  of  second-order 
quality. 

Using  "all  dwellings"  as  a  reference  in  figure  6, 
it  is  evident  that  older  dwellings,  such  as  those  con- 
structed before  1940  fared  worse  than  did  more  recent 
construction.  Two-story  dwellings  fared  even  more 


poorly;  however,  the  sample  was  small  (less  than  3 
percent  of  the  total)  and  included  many  older  build- 
ings. Dwellings  of  part  one  and  part  two  stories  fared 
poorest  of  all;  no  doubt  this  reflected  the  particular 
design  characteristics  (photo  9).  Interestingly,  no  es- 
sential difference  could  be  detected  in  the  relative  per- 
formance of  wood-joist  floors  vs.  concrete-slab  floors 
on  grade,  even  though  the  structures  with  concrete- 
slab  construction  were  usually  newer. 

Figure  6  leads  to  the  foilowing  conclusions,  pro- 
vided the  previously  described  qualifications  are  kept 
in  mind: 

1.  About  25  percent  of  all  of  the  dwellings  in  the 
hardest-hit  area  had  losses  over  5  percent.  This 
represents  1  percent  of  all  of  the  dwellings  in  the 
San  Fernando  Valle)'  considered  in  this  study; 
stated  in  a  different  way,  about  3,200  dwelling

units  out  of  more  than  300,000  had  5  percent  or 
greater  loss. 

2.  There  was  no  noticeable  difference  between  the 
performance  of  concrete-slab  floors  and  wood- 
joist  floors. 

3.  One-stor\-  dwellings  performed  substantiall&gt;' 
better  tiian  did  two-sror\-  dwellings,  and  much 
better  than  combination  one-and-r\\o-story  dwell- 
ings. 

4.  Modern  dwellings  performed  noticcabI\'  better 
than  did  older  d\\ellings. 

Gcofri-aphic  distribution  of  heaviest  direlliiif^  dm)i- 
age.  The  12,037  dwellings  examined  were  divided 
into  62  tracts.  The  boundaries  of  each  tract  were  de- 
termined on  the  basis  of  area,  number  of  dwellings, 
and  distribution  of  damage,  in  order  to  minimize 
differences.  The  area  show  n  in  figure  5  includes  about 
80  percent  of  these  tracts. 

In  the  preparation  of  figure  5,  the  average  percent- 
age dollar  loss  per  dwelling  was  computed  and  rounded 
off  to  the  nearest  whole  percent;  these  loss  percentages 
arc  shown  for  each  tract.  The  calculated  average  loss 
per  d\\elling  is  6.6  percent  for  all  tracts. 

The  heavily  stippled  tracts  in  figure  5  include  all 
those  having  the  average  6  percent  loss  or  greater.  At 
least  two  zones  of  higher-than-avcrage  dwelling  dam- 
age e.xist:  one  contiguous  with  the  zone  of  faulting  in 
the  San  Fernando  \'allcy  and  the  other  along  the  base 
of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains.  Additionally,  the  ac- 
centuated damage  along  the  base  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  includes  Olive  \^icw  Hospital  and  the  Vet- 
erans Administration  Hospital  which  arc  discussed 
elsewhere  in  this  paper.  Figure  5  is  somewhat  mislead- 
ing since  the  zone  of  intensified  damage  ^\•as  normally 
no  more  than  several  cit\'  blocks  wide. 

In  another  and  independent  approach,  we  plotted 
all  structures  inspected  and  posted  "unsafe"  by  the 
City  of  Los  Angeles  as  shown  by  the  dots  on  figure  5. 
(Unsafe  structures  within  the  city  of  San  Fernando 
were  not  plotted  as  the  bases  of  comparison  were  not 
compatible.)  The  dots  on  figure  5  (unsafe  structures) 
included  structures  that  were  not  dwellings.  The  "un- 
safe" posting  did  not  indicate  the  amount  of  loss  and 
nia\-  have  been  influenced  by  non-structural  considera- 
tions. However,  the  correlation  between  the  Los  An- 
geles posted  "unsafe"  structures  and  the  dwelling- 
damage  pattern  is  excellent.  It  will  be  noted  that  the 
heaviest  concentration  of  unsafe  structures  was  against 
the  base  of  the  hills  (shown  at  the  top  of  the  map) 
and  along  the  fault  breakage. 

The  reason  for  this  intensified  damage  appears  to 
be  related  to  the  discontinuity  between  the  soft  allu- 
vial soil  in  the  valle\'  and  the  much  firmer  soil  and 
rock  in  the  foothills.  Certainl\-,  it  is  a  geologically' 
hazardous  area  and,  surprisingly,  more  hazardous  on  a 
tract  basis  than  the  tracts  showing  fault  movement. 

Mobile  Homes 

While  mobile  homes  are  structurally'  quite  differ- 
ent from  wood-frame  dwellings,  their  earthquake-per- 
formance characteristics  arc  similar.  A  mobile  home  is 
a  coach  unit  which  is  transported  on  wheels  to  a  site 
where  it  can  be  raised  off  its  wheels  and  leveled.  The 


wheels,  but  not  the  axle  spindles  and  drum  unit  which 
the  wheels  and  tires  fasten  to,  may  be  removed  and 
stored. 

To  set  up,  the  coach  is  rolled  into  place  above  one 
of  several  t\'pes  of  piers  placed  at  intervals  of  about  6 
feet  along  the  main  frame.  A  jack  on  the  top  of  each 
pier  is  then  screwed  into  contact  with  the  undercar- 
riage until  the  coach  is  level  and  steady  on  the  mounts. 
Where  there  are  soft  soils,  concrete-block  masonr\'  or 
flat  cement  patio  blocks  are  used  to  spread  the  load  so 
as  to  prevent  settling.  Utilities  are  then  hooked  up;  an 
aluminum  skirt  is  attached  around  the  base;  and  stairs 
are  placed  at  the  doorway. 

The  trailers  that  were  significantly  damaged  did 
not  have  the  piers  anchored  to  the  ground,  nor  were 
the  screwjack  levelers  at  the  top  of  the  piers  fastened 
to  the  frame  of  the  coach.  The  support  was  structur- 
all\'  poor;  the  earthquake  vividl\-  demonstrated  this. 
The  precast-concrete  pxramid-shaped  piers  rolled 
over,  dropping  the  coach  and  often  piercing  the  ply- 
wood floor.  Photo  10  is  an  example  of  typical  damage.

UGHJ  INDUSTRIAL  CONSTRUCTION 

This  examination  of  the  performance  of  light  in- 
dustrial construction  included  61  buildings,  all  in  the 
hardest-hit  area  of  the  San  Fernando  \^alley.  Probably 
all  examined  structures  were  built  within  the  past  10 
\ears,  and  therefore  all  should  have  been  designed  and 
constructed  in  accordance  with  the  earthquake-bracing 
provisions  of  the  building  codes  of  the  City  or  County 
of  Los  Angeles.  The  Los  Angeles  earthquake  provisions 
and  the  structural  requirements  for  construction  types 
discussed  herein,  generally  speaking,  are  essentially  the 
same  as  those  found  throughout  California.  Fifty-six  of 
the  buildings  were  examined  in  detail  in  this  study; 
they  represent,  b\-  far,  the  best  earthquake  test  of  their 
construction  type  to  date — an  experience  of  substantial 
value  for  all  earthquake-prone  areas. 

The  buildings  were  one  ston,'  and  one  floor  but 
two  stories  high,  and  few  had  mezzanines.  All  were  in 
two  industrial  tracts  (Arroyo  tract  and  Bradley  tract). 


1974 


San  Fernando  Earthquake — Damage

Their  locations  are  shown  on  figure  2.  These  structures 
were  all  light  industrial  buildings  with  plywood  roofs 
and  tilt-up  concrete  or  unit-masonry  ^^■alfs,  except  for 
a  small  section  of  one  plywood  roof  which  was  of  un- 
damaged poured  gypsum.  For  all  practical  purposes,  all 
buildings  examined  had  plywood  roofs. 

Of  the  61  buildings  in  the  two  tracts,  56  were 
examined  in  detail,  both  inside  and  out;  interior  access 
to  the  other  five  structures  was  denied.  The  data 
gathered  included  detailed  measurements,  assessment, 
and  photography  of  the  damaged  areas;  the  examina- 
tion of  construction  drawings  when  available;  and  the 
review  of  actual  repair  costs  A\hen  available.  Damage 
was  catalogued  for  each  structure — stating  the  type 
and  extent  of  roof  damage,  ground-floor  damage,  wall 
damage,  and  the  degree  of  soil  disturbance  at  the  site. 
Dollar  losses  were  computed  as  well  as  the  pre-earth- 
quake  "present  worth"  values  determined. 

Construction  Characteristics  and 
Earthquake  Design  Features 

All  unit-masonry  walls  (brick  and  hollow  con- 
crete block)  were  reinforced  with  steel  and  had  roof- 
to-wall  ties  as  required  by  the  building  code.  Some  had 
floor-to-M'all  ties.  All  reinforced  concrete  walls  were 
of  the  tilt-up  type  (precast  reinforced  concrete  wall 
panels  which  \\cre  tilted  into  place),  with  the  tilt-up 
wall  panels  usually  interconnected  by  poured-in-place 
pilasters  of  reinforced  concrete.  In  a  (ew  structures, 
structural  steel  columns  were  used  instead  of  rein- 
forced concrete  pilasters,  but  no  significant  difference 
in  damage  pattern  was  noted. 

Whatever  the  wall  material,  all  buildings  had  ply- 
\\ood  roofs  which  A\ere  intended  to  act  as  diaphragms 
("stressed  skin"  in  one  sense  of  the  phrase)  in  the 
event  of  an  earthquake.  The  diaphragms  typically 
were  supported  by  wood  joists  and  beams  which 
were  supported  in  turn  on  wooden  glulam  or  tapered 
steel  beams.  (Glulam  beams  are  normally  fabricated 
from  glued-togetlier  2"x4"  or  2"x6"  wood.)  Interior 
columns,  where  present,  were  usually  steel,  although 
some  structures  iiad  concrete  and  wood  columns. 

Typical  roof  diaphragm-to-wall  connection  detail 
consisted  of  a  4-inch-thick  ledger  which  was  bolted  to 
the  wall.  Purlins  were  hung  from  the  ledger  in  metal 
hangers  and  a  plywood  diaphragm  nailed  to  the  ledger 
and  purlins. 

Soil  in  both  tracts  was  structurally  weak  alluvium. 
However,  nominalh-  sized  rcinforced-concrcte  spread 
footings  and /or  drilled-concrete  friction  piling  are 
quite  adequate  for  all  normal  conditions.  Soil  in  the 
Arroyo  tract  was  described  in  a  soils  engineering  re- 
port for  a  specific  site:  " The  boring  penetrated 

SVi  feet  of  dense  cohesionless  sand  containing  30  to 
50  percent  of  gravel  and  cobbles  to  12  inches  in  di- 
ameter. Drilling  was  ver\-  difficult  because  of  caving 
and  the  large  proportion  of  cobbles.  Only  one  rela- 
tively undisturbed  sample  could  be  obtained  from  this 
formation " 

Types  of  Damage — Arroyo  Tract 

The  Arroyo  industrial  tract  is  on  the  north  edge 
of  the  San  Fernando  \'allev  adjacent  to  the  foothills 


of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  (figure  2).  Significant 
ground  breakage,  including  faulting,  in  and  about  some 
of  the  buildings  caused  extensive  damage.  Severe  dam- 
age to  other  buildings  was  principally  due  to  vibration. 
While  buildings  on  sites  where  there  was  signifi- 
cant ground  breakage  were  often  badly  damaged,  the 
degree  of  damage  resulting  from  soil  disturbance  was 
not  necessarily  in  keeping  with  outx\ard  appearance  of 
the  building.  The  obvious  damage  to  the  building 
shown  in  photo  1 1  would,  at  first  glance,  indicate  pos- 
sible total  loss  to  the  structure.  The  badly  damaged 
portion  of  the  building  is  an  entry  walkway  of  wood 
frame  construction.  The  main  portion  of  the  building, 
though  damaged,  performed  reasonably  well;  the 
corner  at  the  edge  of  the  compression  zone  in  the  soil 
was  only  slightly  affected.

ground  movement.  E.  G.  Zoc/ier  photo. 

Conversely,  in  another  case,  the  outward  appear- 
ance of  the  building  did  not  indicate  how  severely  it  was 
damaged.  The  earth  movements  at  this  location  caused 
one  structure  and  an  adjoining  one  to  move  together 
so  that  the  first  building  is  now  from  8  to  12  inches 
hiside  the  formerly  adjacent  structure  (photo  12). 
This  movement,  when  combined  with  a  reported  6- 
inch  separation  between  buildings  prior  to  the  earth- 
quake, indicates  ground  shortening  and/or  building 
movement  of  24  inches  or  more;  this  is  corroborated 
by  the  amount  of  overriding  of  the  sidewalk  in  front 
of  the  building  (photo  13).  The  resulting  damage  to 
the  two  structures  can  be  seen  in  photo  14. 

Unfortunately,  the  type  of  damage  directly  or  in- 
directly due  to  ground  displacements  cannot  be  over- 
come by  existing  earthquake-resistive  design-and-con- 
strucdon  practices,  nor  is  it  practical  to  do  so.  How- 
ever, site-planning  can  and  must  avoid  geologically 
hazardous  locations  as  far  as  the  state  of  the  art  allows. 

The  remaining  structures  in  the  Arroyo  tract  were 
not  known  to  have  been  subjected  to  severe  ground 
displacement.  The  only  rcinforced-concretc  tilt-up- 
wall  building  in  this  tract  to  have  a  wall  panel  collapse 
was  not  on  a  site  having  visible  major  ground  displace- 
ment, although  the  building  lengthened  about  6  inches 
in  a  north-south  direction.  The  severe  damage  that  v.-as

sustained  by  this  structure,  photo  15,  must  be  at-

for  both  tilt-up-wall  and  diaphragm  connections 
(photo  16)  as  well  as  to  the  increase  in  building  length. 

Types  of  Damage — Bradley  Tract 

The  Bradlc)-  tract  is  approximately  3  miles  west 
and  slightly  north  of  tlic  Arroyo  tract.  Ground  dis- 
turbance in  this  tract  was  markedly  less  than  that  in 
the  Arroyo  tract.  As  a  result,  the  damage  to  the  build- 
ings in  the  Bradley  tract  must  be  attributed  more  to

More  than  half  of  the  buildings  in  the  Bradley 
tract  had  portions  of  their  roofs  collapse;  see,  for  an 
e.xample,  photo  17.  Only  three  buildings  had  partial  wall 
collapse;  see,  for  an  example,  photo  18.  A  large  num- 
ber of  buildings  sustained  damage  at  the  roof-beam  (or 
girder) -to-wall  connections.  These  connection  failures 
were  noted  where  portions  of  roofs  collapsed  (photo

pressures  on  the  freestanding  walls,  as  well  as  those 
sections  of  the  roof  A\hich  completeh-  collapsed,  indi- 
cated a  reserve  of  strength  at  the  foundation  level  and 
an  inadequacy  of  the  generally  accepted  roof-to-wall 
standard  connection  details.  While  the  tilt-up  \\alls 
rarely  collapsed,  there  were  man\-  small  cracks  in 
them.  Separations  or  movements  at  the  precast  wall-to- 
poured-pilaster  juncture  were  very  common,  with  or 
without  wall  collapse. 

Typical  damage  to  buildings  with  dock-height 
floors  was  cracking  of  wall  panels,  and  in  some  cases, 
cracking  of  columns  on  the  first  floor  level.  This  type 
of  damage  occurred  even  if  the  roof  diaphragm  re- 
mained intact.

Data  Analysis 

The  S6  buildings  in  the  Arroyo  and  Bradley  tracts 
which  were  examined  in  detail  gave  the  opportunity 
to  determine  dollar  losses  accurately  and  establish 
pre-earthquakc  present-worth  values.  In  summary,  the 
pre-earthquake  "present-worth"  value  was  $11,699,000 
while  earthquake  loss  \\as  established  at  12,065,000, 
or  17.7  percent. 

The  other  industrial  tracts  located  outside  the 
heavily  shaken  area  had  far  less  damage,  usually  negli- 
gible or  none,  except  along  the  Soledad  road  north 
of  the  area  under  study.  It  is  reasonable  to  believe 
now  that  the  average  loss  for  buildings  throughout  the 
San  Fernando  \'alley  was  less  than  3  percent,  possibly 
less  than  1  percent. 


l_l 


Figure  7  shows  the  loss  distribution  by  type  of  wall 
construction.  Clearly,  almost  half  of  the  buildings  ex- 
amined had  less  than  10  percent  loss;  the  right  side  of 
figure  7  shows  losses  under  5  percent  to  be  common. 

Figure  7  also  shows  that  unit-masonry  (reinforced 
brick  and  reinforced  hollow  concrete  block)  per- 
formed well.  The  data  in  figure  7  should  not  be  inter- 
preted to  mean  that  unit-masonry  walls  performed 
better  than  tilt-up  walls,  despite  the  rapid  comparative 
drop-off  in  loss  to  unit  masonry.  The  sample  is  too 
small  and  other  problems,  such  as  the  larger  diaphragm 
areas  in  tilt-ups,  do  not  allow  accurate  quantitative 
comparison  between  the  relative  performance  of  brick 
and  hollow-concretc-block  walls  with  tilt-ups.  How- 
ever, based  on  field  observations,  their  performances 
appeared  to  be  about  equal.  In  any  event,  the  data 
show  that  unit-masonry  and  tilt-up  walls  can  be 
equally  effective  earthquake-bracing  elements,  but 
there  is  no  available  information  to  compare  them 
with  poured-in-place  reinforced  concrete  walls. 

Further  examination  of  figure  7  indicates  major 
ground  disturbance  at  the  site  increases  the  loss,  and 
this  is  more  vividly  pointed  out  in  greater  detail  in 
table  8.  Clearly,  when  there  w-as  no  or  slight  ground 
disturbance  at  the  site,  losses  were  under  20  percent.

Ground  disturbance  indicators: 

None  or  slight:  No  cracks  or  hairline  cracks  to  one-eighth  inch  in 
paving  or  ground. 

Noticeable:  Cracks  in  paving  or  soil  to  seven-eighths  inch. 

Moderate:  Cracks  in  paving  or  soil  to  lyi  inches.  Offset  in  curbs, 
buckling  of  sidewalks  or  curbs,  indicating  1-  to  2-inch  compressional 
effects. 

Major:  Cracks  over  Ij^  inches.  Compressional  effects  in  paving,

more  than  2  inches.  Faulting. 

A  30  percent  probable  maximum  loss  in  value  for  all

Buildings  subjected  to  ground  upheaval  and  lateral 
riirust  such  as  that  found  in  the  Arroyo  tract  cannot 
be  expected  to  come  through  such  an  experience 
imscathcd.  Aluch  of  the  damage  found,  however, 
could  have  been  avoided  or  markedly  reduced  had 
careful  attention  been  given  to  the  design  and  con- 
struction details.  The  need  for  adequate  and  appro- 
priate geologic  and  soil  information  is  vcr_\-  important.

art  of  soils  engineering  ;ind  the  identification  of 
geologic  hazards  leaves  much  to  be  desired  at  this  time. 

All  evidence  indicates  that  the  buildings  in  these 
two  industrial  tracts  were  subjected  to  seismic  forces 
greater  than  the  design  forces  required  in  any  Amer- 
ican building  code.  Despite  this  evidence,  no  building 
collapsed  totally  nor  did  any  appear  to  be  on  the 
verge  of  total  collapse. 

Based  on  reviews  of  the  plans  or  physical  inspection, 
or  both,  there  were  buildings  where  the  horizontal 
reinforcement  shown  on  the  drawings  or  provided 
would  not  comply  with  the  minimum  requirements 
of  the  Uniform  Building  Code.  Unquestionably,  had 
these  buildings  been  appropriately  designed  for  code 
forces,  they  would  have  survived  markedly  better. 

Present  practices  for  roof-to-wall  ties  are  quite  in- 
adequate. They  probably  represent  the  most  critical 
detail  in  terms  of  hazards.  Had  a  more  positive  anchor- 
age system  of  purlin-to-hanger  and  then  to-wall  been 
required,  far  less  damage  would  have  resulted.  The 
ends  of  all  main  framing  roof  members  such  as  glulam 
girders  should  be  anchored  to  the  walls  (or  pilasters) 
in  a  manner  that  \vi\\  take  t\\"ice  the  total  seismic  de- 
sign force  due  to  the  contributing  tributary  area. 
When  these  members  are  spliced,  the  splices  should 
provide  continuity  to  transmit  these  lateral  forces 
across  the  building.  The  secondary  framing  perpen- 
dicular to  the  main  framing  should  be  treated  simi- 
larly except  that  the  wall  connections  and  splices 
might  be  concentrated  on  members  not  more  than 
8  feet  apart. 

The  failure  of  the  typical  wood  diaphragm-to- 
wall  connection  \\-as  so  \\-idespread  and  similar  that 
it  indicates  a  basic  weakness  in  this  system.  Further- 
more, the  type  of  failure  here  results  in  a  sudden, 
or  "brittle",  type  of  collapse  which  can  be  hazardous. 
Connections  must  be  developed  \\hich  have  adequate 
redundancy  or  toughness  so  that  sudden  collapse  is 
prevented  even  though  large  overstress  occurs.  Dy- 
namic tests  should  be  conducted  on  full-scale  assem- 
blies to  determine  the  mode  of  failures  and  to  make 
necessary  improvements. 

The  joining  of  precast-concrete  tilt-up-panel 
walls  must  be  improved.  The  prevailing  practice,  as 
noted  from  plans  and  from  ph\'sical  inspections,  of 
extending  onl\-  half  of  the  horizontal  wall  reinforce- 
ment into  the  poured-in-place  concrete  pilaster  and 
also  providing  less  than  the  minimum  length  of  bar 
lap  necessary  for  full-bar  development,  is  inadequate. 
Full-bar  development  (by  bond)  is  mandatory  for  im- 
proved performance. 

HIGH-RISE  CONSTRUCTION 

Prior  to  the  1933  Long  Beach,  California,  earth- 
quake, buildings  in  the  metropolitan  Los  Angeles  area, 
including  high-rise  construction,  were  not  generally 
designed  to  resist  earthquake  forces.  Until  1956,  a  Los 
Angeles  City  Ordinance  limited  the  height  of  build- 
ings to  13  stories  or  150  feet,  at  which  time  a  revision 
in  the  ordinance  removed  this  height  limit  for  steel- 
framed  structures.  Shortly  thereafter,  concrete  and 
any  other  s\-stcm  of  materials  was  authorized  for  high- 
rise  construction  \\hen  certain  tests  and  studies  were 
performed.  This  change  in  the  height  limit  was  more

likely  due  to  economic  pressures  and  civic  pride  than 
to  advances  in  the  technology  of  earthquake  engi- 
neering. 

Over  190  buildings,  eight  stories  and  higher,  have 
been  built  in  Los  Angeles  County  since  1947,  and  all 
have  been  designed  to  be  earthquake-resistive.  In  addi- 
tion, there  were  probably  over  100  older  high-rise 
buildings  throughout  the  same  area  built  before  1933 
and  therefore  not  specifically  designed  to  resist  earth- 
quake forces. 

Modern  Earthquake-Resistive  Buildings 

Figure  8  is  a  compilation  of  reported  losses  to  29 
reinforced  concrete  buildings,  7  to  20  stories  in  height, 
located  from  13  to  24  miles  south  of  the  instrumen- 
tally  determined  epicenter  of  the  earthquake  (see 
figure  9).  The  city  of  San  Fernando  and  the  Sylmar 
and  Pacoima  districts  of  Los  Angeles  are  approxi- 
mately 5  to  7  miles  south  of  the  epicenter,  and  one 
may  thereb\'  reduce  by  that  amount  each  of  the  dis- 
tances in  the  table  when  considering  a  building's  prox- 
imity to  the  severely  shaken  area  or  to  the  center  of 
energy-release  of  the  shock. 

Figure  10  is  a  compilation  of  reported  losses  to 
30  completed  steel-frame  buildings,  6  to  42  stories  in 
height,  all  in  the  general  vicinity  of  the  concrete  struc- 
tures (figure  9).

rurally  damaged  wirh  a  reporred  loss  of  1400,000. 
However,  the  authors  know  of  no  significant  struc- 
tural damage  to  completed  steel-frame  high-rise  build- 
ings although  several  reinforced-concrete  buildings 
^\•ere  structurally  damaged.  With  those  exceptions, 
observed  damage  patterns  were  about  the  same. 

Fle.xibly  framed  buildings,  whether  concrete  or 
steel,  received  mostly  cosmetic  damage  on  February 
9  when  relatively  stiff  stair-elevator  and  utility  cores 
within  the  frame  experienced  large  story-to-story  rel- 
ative movements.  In  taller  buildings  elevator  cables 
and  the  containment  of  elevator  counterweights  were 
damaged  and  caused  further  damage.  These  features 
must  receive  more  design  attention  in  the  future. 

The  high  percentage  of  damage  to  store  win- 
dows and  other  damage  along  Ventura  Boulevard 
suggest  an  amplified  ground  motion  for  the  valley 
alluvium  where  it  terminates  at  the  Santa  Monica 
Mountains  along  the  southern  boundary'  of  the  San 
Fernando  Valley.  This  higher-than-average  damage 
may  be  a  reduced-scale  counterpart  to  that  observed 
along  the  north  edge  of  the  valley  in  the  vicinity  of 
Olive  View  Hospital  and  the  Veterans  Administration 
Hospital. 

Figures  8  and  10  show  losses  in  terms  of  cents 
per  square  foot  of  total  floor  area  (above  ground)  as 
functions  of  epicentral  distance  and  of  types  of  con- 


struction (concrete  and  steel).  Losses  include  building 
and  equipment  repair  costs.  Occasionally,  loss  of  con- 
tents was  included  when  it  could  not  be  segregated, 
but  these  losses  \\ere  small  and  have  no  significant 
effect  on  the  conclusions. 

The  following  conclusions  may  be  drawn  from 
an  examination  of  figures  8  and  10: 

1.  Steel-frame  and  reinforced-concrete  high-rise

15  to  25  miles  from  the  epicenter,  with  excep- 
tions as  noted  below.

San  Fernando  Earthquake — ^Damage

Non-Earthquake-Resistive  Buildings 

Older  non-earthquake-resisrive  high-rise  buildings 
performed  quite  badly  when  compared  to  modern 
high-rise  construction,  based  on  limited  selected  infor- 
mation on  older  structures  in  the  downtown  Los  An- 
geles area. 

The  eight  buildings  examined  were  erected  be- 
tween 1906  and  1916,  prior  to  enactment  of  earth- 
quake requirements  in  the  Los  Angeles  City  code;  that 
is,  the  engineering  design  considered  only  the  vertical 
loadings  and  not  earthquake  forces.  However,  during 
that  construction  period,  fireproofing  of  the  steel 
jrames  often  was  a  monolithic  concrete  covering 
which  inherently  developed  a  strong  "composite" 
structure  of  steel  and  concrete.  This  is  not  common 
under  present  construction  methods  which  employ  a 
sprayed-on  light-weight  asbestos  material. 

Six  of  the  buildings  examined  had  steel  frames, 
and  the  other  r\vo  had  reinforced-concrete  frames. 
Dollar  loss  as  a  percentage  of  assessed  market  value 
ranged  from  5  percent  to  26  percent.  These  losses, 
when  compared  to  the  less  than  1  percent  loss  for 
almost  all  modern  earthquake-resistive  buildings,  make 
a  substantial  case  for  best  modern  practice  in  high-rise 
construction  in  moderate  earthquakes. 

HOSPITALS 

Four  major  hospital  complexes  in  the  San  Fer- 
nando Valley  contained  buildings  which  were  struc- 
turally damaged;  two  of  them  had  buildings  collapse. 
The  U.S.  Office  of  Emergency  Preparedness  reported 
that  17  hospitals  were  damaged  or  destroyed — one 
Federal,  one  County,  and  15  private  hospitals.  The 
collapsed  and  structurally  damaged  buildings  were  at 
Olive  View  Hospital,  Holy  Cross  Hospital,  Pacoima 
Memorial  Lutheran  Hospital,  and  the  U.S.  Veterans 
Administration  Hospital.  They  are  shown  on  figure  2. 
Other  hospitals  in  San  Fernando  Valley  were  damaged, 
but  none  required  closure. 

Many  of  the  privately  owned  medical-center 
buildings  distributed  throughout  the  San  Fernando 
Valley  sustained  varying  degrees  of  damage.  At  least 
three  of  them  were  significantly  damaged;  namely, 
Indian  Hills  Medical  Center,  Foothill  Medical  Build- 
ing, and  Pacoima  Lutheran  Professional  Building. 

Nursing  homes  were  also  damaged.  Most  interest- 
ing among  these  is  the  Foothill  Nursing  Home  where 
surface  faulting  traversed  the  site  (photo  20),  lifting 
the  structure  about  3  feet  above  the  street  in  front 
of  it.  This  one-story  reinforced  hollow-concrete-block 
structure  was  unoccupied  and  unused  at  the  time  of 
the  earthquake.  Although  racked  by  vibration  and 
permanent  ground  displacements  beneath  it,  the  build- 
ing did  not  collapse.  Its  earthquake  performance  under 
these  conditions  \\as  comparativeh'  excellent — cer- 
tainly the  life-safety  hazard  was  substantially  less  than 
that  at  some  buildings  at  the  Olive  View  and  Veterans 
Administration  Hospitals. 

All  of  the  foregoing  specifically  mentioned  build- 
ings were  in  the  area  of  ground  disturbance  or  ver\- 
close  to  it.  Not  unexpectedly,  their  earthquake  dam- 
age represents  the  heaviest  found  to  buildings  used 
for  these  purposes.

The  case  history  of  Olive  View  Hospital  and  a 
summary  description  of  the  Veterans  Administration 
Hospital  are  included  in  the  following  paragraphs  be- 
cause of  their  special  importance. 

Olive  Viev/  Hospital 

The  licensed  880-bed  Olive  View  Hospital, 
owned  by  the  County  of  Los  x\ngeles,  consists  of  a 
large  number  of  buildings,  35  of  \\hich  may  be  50 
or  more  years  old  and  many  of  \\hich  were  con- 
structed prior  to  the  introduction  of  earthquake-re- 
sistive construction  that  followed  the  1933  Long 
Beach  shock. 

The  complex  of  buildings  which  forms  Olive 
View  Hospital  is  shown  on  figure  2.  All  of  these 
structures  are  in  the  band  of  substantially  heavier-than- 
normal  damage;  see,  for  example,  figure  5  which  shows 
the  distribution  of  damaged  dwellings  near  the  hospital 
complex. 

Not  all  buildings  were  seriously  damaged,  although 
heavy  damage  was  common.  Several  recently  con- 
structed one-story  concrete-frame  structures  located 
about  100  yards  A\est  of  the  new  hospital  ^\■ere  un- 
damaged. Damaged  structures  included  masonr\'  as 
well  as  wood-frame  construction.  However,  of  sur- 
prise and  great  concern  was  the  damage  to  a  newly 
completed  group  of  three  buildings.  Figure  1 1  is  a 
plot-plan  of  these  three  buildings  and  photo  21  is  an 
over-all  view. 

Three  people  died  at  this  hospital,  all  in  the  newly 
completed  earthquake-resistive  .Medical  Treatment  and 
Care  Building.  That  any  lives  should  be  lost  in,  and 
excessive  damage  occur  to,  a  structure  that  was  be- 
lieved to  be  earthquake-resistive  is  disturbing. 

Medical  Trcm/ient  and  Care  Building.  The  Med- 
ical Treatment  and  Care  Building,  henceforth  called 
the  Medical  Building,  has  five  stories  and  a  basement. 
Since  it  is  on  a  gentl\-  sloping  site,  the  basement  is 
above  grade  on  the  east  and  south  elevations,  below 
grade  on  the  north  elevation,  and  mixed  above  and 
below  grade  on  the  west  elevation.  The  basement 
retaining  walls  were  self-supporting  and  structurally

separated  from  the  building  frame  by  4  inches.  As 
shown  in  figure  11,  the  basement  extends  well  beyond 
the  confines  of  the  outer  walls  of  the  rest  of  the 
building,  except  at  the  north  stair-tower.  Generally, 
landscaping  existed  above  the  basement  where  it  ex- 
tended be&gt;-ond  the  building's  exterior  walls. 

The  Aledical  Building  was  of  reinforced-concrete 
construction,  completed  in  1970.  Foundations  were 
reinforced-concrete  spread-type  on  alluvial  soil.  From 
a  structural  standpoint,  one  may  view  the  Medical 
Building  as  five  distinct  buildings,  with  the  four  tow- 
ers containing  the  stairs  and  day-room-areas  struc- 
turally separated  4  inches  from  the  main  building.  All 
stair-towers  except  the  one  on  the  north  were 
supported  on  the  first-floor  framing  over  the  basement 
area.  The  north  stair-tower  had  its  own  foundations 
outside  the  basement. 

Test  borings  and  excavations  made  before  con- 
struction started  showed  brownish  gray  fine  sand, 
medium  gravel,  and  boulders  at  least  3  feet  in 
diameter. 

A  total  of  606  patients  \\as  in  this  structure  at 
the  time  of  the  shock,  plus  98  staff  members.  Bed 
capacity  was  820. 

Medicn!  Trecitinent  and  Care  Building — earth- 
quake-bracing system.  The  earthquake-bracing  con- 
sisted of  both  frame  bending  and  shear  A\'alls.  ^Vith 
respect  to  the  main  section  of  the  building  (that  is, 
excluding  the  stair  towers),  the  first  story  and  base- 
ment-level earthquake-bracing  was  in  the  form  of 
column  bending.  Concrete  walls  around  the  elevators 
and  interior  stairs  in  the  first  story  were,  by  design- 
er's intent,  constructed  w'nh  a  slip-joint  \\'hich  ^\■ent 
through  these  \\-i\h  and  thereby  prevented  them  from 
acting  as  shear  walls.  As  a  result,  the  first-story  brac- 
ing had  aspects  of  the  flexible  first-story  concept 
which  has  been  known  for  years  but  rarely  used. 
Above  the  first  story,  shear  walls  were  used  for  the 
bracing  system. 

The  four  stair  towers  next  to  the  main  building 
were,  as  noted  before,  structurally  independent  of  the 
main  building. 

Medical  Treatment  and  Care  Building — earth- 
quake dai/iage.  Earthquake  damage  was  excessive  in 
the  first  story  and  basement,  with  little  damage  above 
the  first  story.  This  abrupt  change  in  rigidity  at  the 
second-floor  level  undoubtedly  contributed  to  the 
severe  damage  at  the  first-story  level.  The  building 
was  leaning  as  much  as  2  feet  in  a  northerly  direction 
after  the  shock,  \\ith  essentiall\'  all  of  this  permanent 
offset  (story  drift)  in  the  first  story.  The  first  story 
nearly  collapsed. 

Photos  21  through  34  show  vie\\'S  of  the  exterior 
elevations  and  some  of  the  detailed  damage.  The  spi- 
rally wrapped  reinforced-concrete  columns  (photo 
24)  performed  much  better  than  the  tied  columns 
(photo  25).  Certainly  there  was  a  substantial  reserve 
of  strength  in  the  spirally  wrapped  columns,  or  the 
building  would  have  collapsed,  as  it  was  so  far  out 
of  plumb.  Some  steel  reinforcing  bars  in  columns  were 
broken;  where  the  bars  were  fractured,  the  fractures 
were  near,  but  not  in,  the  welds  (photo  26).  Precast- 
concrete  wall  panels  failed  when  portions  of  the 
building  collapsed    (photo   27).  While  nonstructural

precast-concrete  facings  should  not  be  expected  to  be 
intact  after  the  building  begins  to  collapse,  it  is  not 
unreasonable  to  hope  for  shattered  panels  which  do 
not  leave  their  backing  walls. 

There  was  evidence  of  pounding  of  the  first  floor 
against  the  retaining  walls.  Damage  in  the  first  stor\" 
was  probabl\'  increased  by  the  frame  suddcnl\'  strik- 
ing the  retaining  walls  when  the  building  oscillated 
northward.  This  ma\-  be  one  of  the  reasons  for  the 
2-foot  building  offset  to  the  north. 

Damage  to  first-story  ceiling  tile  (photo  28), 
elevator  doors  (photo  29),  telephone  equipment  in  the 
basement  (photo  30),  and  other  features  was  excessive.

coiinnents.  Power  failed;  communications  were  out; 
four  stair  towers  were  useless;  elevators  \\ere  inopera- 
tive; and  the  hospital  was  on  the  verge  of  collapse. 
The  staff  did  not  panic,  and  patients  were  successfully 
evacuated  to  other  hospitals.  Three  lives  were  lost; 
two  when  power  failed  and  the  electrically  operated 
life-support  systems  stopped  and  the  tiiird  when  a 
person  w  ho  attempted  to  lea\c  the  building  w  as  struck 
outside  by  a  collapsing  portion  of  tiie  building.  The 
time  of  day  (6:01  a.m.)  found  very  few  people  in 
the  first  story,  basement,  and  stair  towers.  Life  loss 
would  have  been  significantly  higher  had  the  earth- 
quake occurred  later  in  the  day. 

No  faulting  was  found  in  the  area,  but  the  ground 
motion  was  sufficiently  severe  to  crack  pavements 
and,  in  some  nearby  places,  leave  cracks  in  the  soil. 

Duration  of  the  strong  motion  was  short,  prob- 
ably not  much  difTcrcnt  from  the  12  seconds  recorded 
at  the  nearby  Pacoima  Dam.  Continued  shaking  would 
have  progressive!)'  weakened  the  columns  and  un- 
doubtedly caused  building  collapse. 

The  building  cost  S2.^  million  and  probably  rep- 
resents a  total  loss,  although  some  suggestions  have 
been  made  for  saving  the  upper  stories. 

Psychiatric  Building.  This  stnicture  was  a  r\vo- 
story  reinforced  concrete-frame  building  designed  in 
1965-66  and  constructed  between  1966  and  1969.  The 
plan  was  roughl&gt;'  T-shapeii,  with  a  first  floor  area 
of  about  40,000  square  feet  and  a  second  floor  area 
of  about  23,000  square  feet. 


The  roof  and  the  second  floor  were  reinforced- 
concrete  pan-joist  systems  with  4/4 -inch  slabs  and 
12-inch-decp  joists  except  for  8-inch-thick  two-way 
slabs  in  the  center  cast-west  bay  of  the  second  floor. 
The  first  floor  \vas  a  4-inch-thick  reinforced-concrete 
slab  on  grade.  Walls  were  mostly  glass  except  for 
several  non-bearing,  reinforced  hollow  concrete-block 
filler  wall  panels  in  both  the  first  and  second  stories. 
The  hollow  concrete-block  wall  panels  were  separated 
1  inch  from  structural  frame  at  their  sides  and  top. 
Lightweight  concrete  was  specified  for  all  concrete 
above  grade. 

The  lateral-force-resisring  s&gt;^tem  consisted  of 
reinforced  concrete  roof  and  second  floor  diaphragms 
which  distributed  lateral  forces  to  the  rigid  frame 
bents  along  both  axes.  Second-floor  and  low-roof  dia- 
phragms were  at  two  levels,  with  the  low  roof  being 
about  2  feet  below  the  second  floor.  This  complex 
layout  resulted  in  numerous  different  rigid  frames  in 
both  directions. 

Very  small  torsional  loads  were  produced  because 
of  small  eccentricities  between  centers  of  rigidity  and 
mass  at  both  levels. 

An  approximate  evaluation  of  the  lateral-force 
adcquac&gt;-  indicated  that  the  ultimate  capacity  of  the 
columns  in  shear  and  bending  would  be  reached  with 
loads  produced  by  accelerations  between  15  and  25 
percent  of  gravity. 

Cause  of  the  collapse  was  ground  motion,  both 
vertical  and  horizontal,  which  induced  stresses  in  the 
lateral-force-rcsisting  elements  beyond  their  ultimate 
capacity.  Specificall\-,  the  first-story  columns  failed, 
dropping  the  second  floor  onto  the  first  floor  (photo 
35).  The  second  floor  also  was  translated  toward  the 
south  and  east,  rotating  slightly  counter-clockwise 
when  viewed  from  above.  The  center  of  rotation  was 
somewhere  near  the  northeast  corner.  Photo  36  shows 
the  remains  of  a  reinforced-concrete  column. 

A  possible  cause  for  the  building  rotation  could 
be  the  performance  of  the  north-south  reinforced- 
masonr\'  non-bearing  walls  in  the  southeast  corner 
area.  These  non-bearing  walls  probably  acted  as  shear 
\\'alls  during  the  excessive  deflections  which  led  to 
failure  and  thereby  prevented  the  east  portion  of  the

building  from  translating  as  far  south  as  the  west 
portion. 

The  second  story  columns  were  severely  cracked 
and  bent  but  did  not  collapse.  Interior  partitions,  ceil- 
ings, fixtures  and  other  contents  at  the  .second  story 
level    were  also  seriously  damaged. 

It  is  reasoned  that  column  failure  started  with 
shear-type  failures  which  combined  with  strong  xeni- 
cal  loading,  causing  the  concrete  to  crack  and  shatter. 

The  time  of  day  proved  to  be  most  fortunate. 
According  to  the  hospital  authorities,  normal  day 
use  would  have  found  about  300  persons  in  the  col- 
lapsed first  story.  Undoubtedly,  a  very  large  majorit}- 
of  these  persons  would  have  been  killed  had  the  earth- 
quake occurred  during  \\'orking  hours. 

Central  Heating  and  Air  Conditioning  Plant. 
The  Central  Heating  and  Air  Conditioning  Plant  is  a 
one-story-and-mezzanine  independent  building  (figure 
11).  By  contrast,  it  performed  well  as  a  building, 
although  the  equipment  did  not.  This  mixed-construc- 
tion building  showed  some  damage  to  reinforced  hol- 
lo\\--concrete-block  shear  walls  but  lost  its  steel 
flat-bar  x-bracing  in  a  temporary  wall  (photo  37). 
The  original  value  of  the  building  has  been  placed  at 
$1.5  million,  with  building  loss  estimated  at  20  percent 
to  25  percent. 

Boilers  shifted  as  much  as  4  feet  and  caused  a 
small  fire.  Photos  38  and  39  show  the  damage  to 
piping  and  other  equipment.  Possibly  the  most  im- 
portant lesson,  ho\\ever,  comes  from  the  failure  of 
unanchored  and  poorly  anchored  equipment  required 
for  standby  power.  Photo  40  shows  the  failure  of 
unanchored  batteries  required  for  activating  this 
standby  power,  and  photo  41  shows  the  damage  to 
the  emergency  generator.  It  is  mandatory  that  standby 
power  equipment,  as  well  as  emergency  communica- 
tions equipment,  be  strongly  and  very  conservatively 
braced.  Bracing  of  this  t\pe  of  equipment  is  too  often 
neglected  by  all  concerned. 

Other  structures.  In  the  immediate  vicinity*  of 
the  three  previously  described  buildings  are  several

other  new  structures.  Photo  42  shows  the  seriously 
damaged  ambulance  carport  south  of  the  .Medical 
Building;  there  was  evidence  of  high  vertical  accelera- 
tion. The  Assembly  Building  was  also  badly  damaged 
and  leaning  to  the  north.  Photo  43  shows  the  typical 
serious  cracking  of  the  roof  cantilevers  of  the  Fume 
Exhaust  Building  north  of  the  Medical  Building,  again 
explainable  by  high  vertical  acceleration. 

Much  older  construction  elsewhere  on  this  hospi- 
tal site  also  was  heavily  damaged.  Photo  44  shows  the 
collapse  of  an  unreinforced  hollow-concrete-block 
building.  Old  wood-frame  structures  typically  fell 
when  their  unbraced  cripple-studs  gave  way  (photo 
45);  this  type  of  damage  very  rarely  leads  to  loss  of 
life.

the  hill  near  the  tank  was  shattered  by  the  shaking; 
the  pavement  around  the  building  ^\•as  buckled  or 
cracked;  and  cracks  were  opened  in  the  ground. 

The  foregoing  are  consistent  with  very  heavy 
horizontal  ground  shaking  on  soft  soil.  This  is  par- 
tially confirmed  by  the  several  overturned  concrete 
benches  (photo  34);  roughh'  made  calculations  sug- 
gest earthquake  forces  of  two-thirds  (67%)  of  grav- 
ity. This  is  well  over  code-required  forces;  this 
subject  is  more  thoroughly  discussed  in  the  section 
on  earthquake  forces.  \^ertical  acceleration  was  also 
excessiveh'  high  as  evidenced  by  failed  cantilever 
beams  and  by  some  broken  basement  columns. 

It  may  be  stated  in  summary: 

1.  Vertical  and  horizontal  earthquake  forces  sub- 
stantialh-  exceeded  the  code  values.  Certainly 
the  building  codes  need  strengthening  in  this 
regard  for  structures  located  in  similar  types 
of  geologically  hazardous  earthquake  settings. 
Also,  the  basic  philosophy  of  what  constitutes 
acceptable  damage,  considering  the  actual  lat- 
eral-force levels,  must  be  re-examined. 

2.  The  damage  to  the  recently  completed  rein- 
forced-concrete  structures  appears  to  be  exces- 
sive when  compared  to  other  construction 
types  at  the  site.  The  need  for  greater  ductilit&gt;' 
and  toughness  was  emphasized  by  the  superior 


behavior  of  spirall\"  wrapped  reinforccd-con- 
crete  columns  as  compared  to  tied  reinforced 
concrete  columns. 

3.  Structures  having  facilities  vitally  needed  after 
an  earthquake,  such  as  hospitals,  must  contain 
special  damage-control  features  necessary  for 
continued  safe  occupancy.  Damage  control 
must  be  included  in  the  mechanical  and  elec- 
trical features,  as  well  as  in  the  structure. 

4.  Only  the  time  of  da&gt;'  prevented  a  loss  of  life 
in  terms  of  hundreds  of  persons  instead  of 
only  three. 

Veterans  Administration  Hospital 

The  complex  of  buildings  which  constitutes  the 
Veterans  Administration  Hospital  is  located  at  the 
base  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  adjacent  to  Paco- 
ima  Canyon  (figure  2).  Pacoima  Dam,  with  its  high 
recorded  earthquake  forces,  is  little  more  than  a  mile 
away. 

Construction  details  are  still  not  adequately 
known  to  the  authors.  However,  much  of  the  prc- 
1933  construction  is  of  reinforced  concrete,  including 
the  collapsed  structure.

Times  photo. 

The  San  Fernando  \'eterans  Administration  Hos- 
pital (420  beds)  consisted  of  about  26  buildings  and 
their  additions  built  before  193  3  and  therefore  with- 
out earthquake-resistive  features.  Earthquake-resistive 
features  ^\■ere  incorporated  into  the  design  of  about 
21  buildings  and  their  additions  built  after  1933. 

The  older  buildings  A\xre  generally  constructed 
with  reinforced-concretc  frames  ^hich  were  designed 
to  carry  only  vertical  loads;  unreinforccd  hollow-clay- 
tile  exterior  filler  walls  were  used  in  conjunction  with 
these  frames.  A  few  were  constructed  with  wood 
frames  and  unrcinforced  hollo\\-clay-tile  bearing 
walls. 

The  newer  major  structures  generally  had  rein- 
forced-concrete  frames  and/or  bearing  walls.

Permanent  ground  movements  probably  did  not 
play  a  significant  role  in  the  damage  at  this  site; 
rather,  severe  ground-shaking  was  the  principal  cause 
of  the  damage.  Four  of  the  old  (pre-1933)  buildings 
totall)'  collapsed  during  the  initial  movements  of  the 
main  shock  while  the  remainder  suffered  varying  de- 
grees of  damage,  mostly  severe.  Four  of  the  newer 
buildings  suffered  some  damage,  but  the  remainder 
of  the  earthquake-resistive  buildings  were  essentially 
undamaged. 

This  is  a  good  example  of  the  superior  perform- 
ance of  structures  especially  designed  to  resist  strong 
earthquake  forces  when  compared  to  the  older  build- 
ings without  earthquake-resistive  features. 

Forty-seven  persons  died  in  the  collapse  of  the 
structures  or  later  from  injuries  suffered  in  the  col- 
lapse, and  this  represented  the  majority  of  the  deaths 


in   the  entire  earthquake.  Some  damage  details  and 
rescue  operations  may  be  seen  in  photos  47  and  48. 

It  should  be  clearly  noted  that  the  Veterans  Ad- 
ministration Hospital  is  located  in  the  band  of 
accentuated  damage  found  along  the  base  of  the  San 
Gabriel  Mountains. 

Hospital  Damage:  A  Special  Problem 

The  exceptionally  heavy  damage  to  hospital 
buildings,  nursing  homes,  and  medical-center  buildings 
points  out  a  very  serious  public  problem.  Hospitals 
and  related  occupancies  arc  a  much  greater  and  more 
vital  need  after  a  disaster  than  before  it.  However,  the 
minimum  earthquake  requirements  of  virtually  all 
building  codes  allow  all  occupancies,  including  hos- 
pitals, to  receive  structural  damage,  providing  the 
people  \\ithin  the  structure  can  safely  leave  the  build- 
ing. More  specifically,  the  "Recommended  Lateral 
Force  Requirements  and  Commentary"  (1968)  by  the 
Structural  Engineers  Association  of  California  states 
on  page  3?  regarding  expected  building  damage: 

1.  Resist   minor   earthquokes  without  damage. 

2.  Resist  moderate  earthquakes  without  structural  damage  but 
with    some    non-structurol    damage. 

3.  Resist  major  earthquokes,  of  the  intensity  of  severity  of  the 
strongest  experienced  in  California,  without  collapse,  but  with 
some   structural   as  well   as   non-structural   damage. 

Seismologically  and  geologicalK'  speaking,  the 
San  Fernando  earthquake  was  a  moderate  shock,  but 
the  damage  to  hospitals  exceeded  even  that  expected 
for  a  major  earthquake.  The  future  does  not  look 
good  if  Olive  View  Hospital  is  an  indicator. 

The  aforementioned  criteria  tiiay  be  satisfactory 
for  office  buildings,  but  surely  public  interest  is  much 
better  served  if  hospital  structures  arc  designed  with 
sufficient  damage-control  features  so  as  to  assure  that 
the  structure  \\\\\  remain  functional  after  the  event. 
This  means  placing  severe  limits,  not  only  on  permis- 
sible structural  damage,  but  on  permissible  elevator 
damage,  telephone  and  other  communication  damage, 
standb\-po\\ cr  damage,  and  the  like.  Ccrtainl\-,  hospi- 
tals must  be  kept  nut  of  fault  zones.  Any  attempt  to 
replace  these  facilities  should  come  under  the  scrutiny 
of  all  disciplines,  with  site  location  based  on  more 
factors  than  being  politically  favorable. 

GEOGRAPHIC  DISTRIBUTION  OF  DAMAGE 

Building  damage  was,  of  course,  very  heavy  along 
the  surface  expression  of  the  fault.  However,  the  geo- 
graphic distribution  of  damage  on  either  side  of  the 
fault  ruptures  is  of  principal  interest  in  the  following 
discussions. 

The  distribution  of  heaviest  dwelling  damage  in 
San  Fernando  \'alley  is  clearly  evident  in  figure  5. 
These  data  are  of  particular  significance  because  of 
the  large  number  of  dwellings  examined,  the  use  of 
consistent  sampling  methods,  and  the  reasonable  uni- 
formit\'  of  dwelling  contruction.  It  will  be  noted  in 
figure  5  that  a  band  of  intensified  damage  exists  along 
the  base  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  as  well  as  along 
the  surface  faulting. 

Equally  impressive  to  the  authors,  but  requiring 
a  more  subjective  evaluation,  was  the  geographic  dis-

tribution  of  damage  to  certain  hospitals,  certain  med- 
ical buildings,  the  Sylmar  Juvenile  Hall  Facility,  the 
Jensen  Water  Treatment  Plant,  and  two  groups  of 
freeway  overpasses — all  substantially  north  of  the 
surface  faulting.  The  locations  of  these  structures 
roughly  formed  a  band  of  damage  on  thick,  coarse 
aluvial  soil  overlying  thousands  of  feet  of  partly  con- 
solidated, sharply  downfoldcd  sedimentary  materials 
parallel  to  the  base  of  the  foothills  of  the  San  Gabriel 
Mountains  (figure  12  ,  and  Oakeshott,  1958,  plate  3, 
Geologic  Structure  Sections).  This  is  also  true  for 
the  area  betvveen  the  surface  faulting  and  the  band 
of  damage  at  the  base  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains. 
However,  by  an\-  standard  known  to  the  authors,  the 
over-all  damage  north  of  the  surface  faulting  was 
substantially  greater  than  south  of  it.  It  was  evident 
that  the  locations  of  accentuated  damage  to  the  struc- 
tures mentioned  in  this  paragraph  were  in  close  agree- 
ment \\'ith  the  d\\'elling  damage  pattern  in  figure  5. 

Another  viewpoint  on  the  geographic  distribution 
of  damage  was  obtained  from  a  review  of  damage  to 
the  underground  water,  sewer,  and  gas  systems. 
Figure  12  lists  the  breaks  to  these  systems  (excluding 
service  breaks)  in  accordance  with  the  tract  numbers 
established  for  the  dwelling  study.  These  data  are 
from  incomplete  maps  and  other  partial  records  since 
repairs  were  not  completed  when  the  information 
was  gathered,  particularly  for  the  city  of  San  Fer- 
nando. Additionally,  within  that  city  some  lines  were 
so  badly  shattered  that  they  were  abandoned  and  it 
was  not  reasonable  to  count  the  breaks.  However, 
within  the  city  of  San  Fernando,  faulting  was  defi- 
nitely the  cause  of  the  large  majority  of  the  breaks. 

It  is  evident  that  the  underground  lines  suffered 
most  heavily  in  the  same  tracts  where  dwelling  and 
other  structures  were  most  heavily  damaged.  Exclud- 
ing fault-related  breaks  to  water  mains,  gas  mains,  and 
sewers,  the  remaining  breaks  can  be  primarily  at- 
tributed to  violent  shaking  beyond  the  alluvium's 
capacity  to  remain  intact.  The  foregoing  is  based  on 
numerous  pipe  breaks  examined  by  the  authors  during 
field  investigations.  The  locations  of  the  pipe  breaks 
strongly  suggest  that  the  surface  of  the  thick  alluvial 
materials  folded  downward  in  a  syncline  along  the 
base  of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  was  the  most 
heavily  shaken  if  it  can  be  assumed  that  the  structural 
strength  and  dynamic  characteristics  of  the  alluvial 
materials  were  not  vastly  different  throughout  the 
studied  portion  of  the  area  shown  in  figure  12.  Based 
on  information  available  to  date,  this  assumption 
seems  reasonable. 

Exact  correlation  between  the  number  of  pipe 
breaks  and  building  damage  is  not  to  be  expected 
because,  as  mentioned,  pipe-breakage  data  are  incom- 
plete. Additionally,  the  number  of  miles  of  mains  in 
each  tract  was  not  compiled  at  the  time  of  this  writ- 
ing. (Obviously,  the  number  of  breaks  per  mile  per 
tract  would  be  more  meaningful  than  the  total  number 
of  breaks.)  Lastly,  the  pre-earthquake  condition  of  the 
lines  is  not  known  to  the  authors,  although  we  do 
know  of  some  breaks  in  lines  that  were  so  badly 
rusted  that  only  moderate  pressure-surges  within  the 
lines  could  have  caused  failures.  Despite  these  incon- 


sistencies, the  evidence  strongly  indicates  that  damage 
to  the  underground  water,  gas,  and  sewage  mains  cor- 
related well  with  building  damage. 

While  the  locations  of  pipeline  damage  and  build- 
ing damage  were  in  good  agreement,  observable  per- 
vianent  ground  differential  displacements  outside  of 
the  faulted  areas  were  not  so  clearly  related  and  were 
few  in  number.  Asphalt  pavement  cracks  were  com- 
mon, and  shifted  concrete  sidewalks  (and  sidewalk 
cracking)  wcve.  common.  However,  in  the  case  of 
cracks  in  asphalt  pavement,  the  width  of  the  pave- 
ment crack  was  substantially  greater  than  the  width 
of  the  ground  crack  (if  any)  below  the  pavement 
crack;  photo  49  is  one  such  example.  This  suggests 
that  the  violent  ground  motions  left  more  visible  evi-

than  the  soil  cracks. 


dences  in  the  asphalt  pavements  which  were  more 
rigid,  and  probably  much  stronger,  than  their  support- 
ing soils.  It  appears  that  the  underground-pipeline  fail- 
ures follo\\ed  a  pattern  similar  to  the  asphalt-paving 
breakage.  Photos  50  and  51  are  examples  of  pipeline 
damage  which  is  closely  related  to  fault  movement  in 
these  instances. 

The  geographic  distribution  of  damage  in  this  sec- 
tion of  the  San  Fernando  \''alley  clearly  points  out 
areas  requiring  detailed  instrumental  and  theoretical 
investigations.  Similar  geologic  conditions  appear  to 
be  very  common  throughout  the  Los  Angeles  Basin 
as  well  as  throughout  California.  The  identification  of

these  areas  is  mandatory  for  progress  in  good  land-use 
planning  in  seismic  areas  as  well  as  providing  the  basis 
for  building-code  provisions  necessary  to  minimize 
damage.  Intensified  damage  on  alluvium  has  been  men- 
tioned in  reports  on  other  earthquakes.  For  one  ex- 
ample, Miller  (in  Steinbrugge,  1970)  points  this  out 
as  one  possible  explanation  for  intensified  damage  in 
the  1969  Santa  Rosa,  California,  earthquakes. 

It  is  a  feeling  on  the  part  of  some  engineers  that 
an  apparently  related  problem  exists  in  the  band  of 
intensified  damage  found  along  (or  near)  Ventura 
Boulevard.  The  damage  along  this  southern  edge  of 
San  Fernando  Valley  (figure  2)  strongly  suggests  that 
motion  here  may  have  also  been  amplified.  Because  of 
Ventura  Boulevard's  greater  distance  from  the  earth- 
quake's energy  source,  the  damage  patterns  were  not 
nearly  as  pronounced  as  those  found  to  the  north.  It 
seems  reasonable  that  the  previously  recommended 
studies  should  include  both  the  north  and  south  bound- 
aries of  the  San  Fernando  Valley. 

In  conclusion,  detailed  instrumental  and  theoreti- 
cal studies  of  the  dynamic  properties  of  soil,  particu- 
larly the  alluvial  material  and  Tertiar\'-Quaternary 
sedimentary  formations,  leading  to  land-use  planning 
regulations  and  building  code  revisions,  if  necessary, 
must  be  given  high  research  priority.

CHAPTER     26 

Performance  of  Public  School  Buildings^ 

by  J.  F.  Meehan  * 


The  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971, 
clearly  demonstrated  the  vast  difference  in  the  per- 
formance of  public  school  buildings  constructed  under 
the  provisions  of  the  Field  Act  and  school  buildings 
constructed  before  its  enactment.  School  buildings 
constructed  since  the  enactment  of  the  Field  Act  in 
1933  were  damaged  far  less  than  those  built  before 
that  year.  Practically  every  conceivable  form  of  school 
building  construction  was  exposed  to  the  San  Fer- 
nando earthquake  motion.  No  public  school  building 
collapsed. 

A  strong-motion  instrument  on  the  east  abutment 
of  Pacoima  Dam  recorded  the  earthquake  accelera- 
tions that  were  the  highest  ever  recorded  anywhere 
in  the  world — in  the  0.50  to  0.75-g  range  with  several 
high-frequency  excursions  to  1.25  g.  The  duration  of 
the  strong  motion  portion  was  approximately  12 
seconds. 

LEGAL  CONSIDERATIONS 

The  Field  Act  was  enacted  by  the  California 
State  Legislature  within  about  one  month  after  the 
March  10,  1933,  earthquake  in  Long  Beach.  That  6.3 
Richter-magnitude  earthquake,  with  its  epicenter  just 
offshore  from  Newport  Beach,  extensively  damaged 
structures  throughout  the  Long  Beach,  Compton,  and 
Whittier  areas,  as  well  as  causing  some  damage  to 
downtown  Los  Angeles  buildings.  School  buildings 
within  this  area  were  heavily  damaged,  and  many  col- 
lapsed. Although  there  may  have  been  more,  it  is  re- 
ported that  one  student  died  as  a  result  of  injuries 
sustained  from  falling  debris  in  a  Norwalk  High 
School  gymnasium  (oral  communication  from  K.  V. 
Marr).  The  Long  Beach  earthquake  occurred  at  5:54 
p.m.  on  a  Friday  afternoon.  Had  the  1933  Long  Beach 
earthquake  occurred  during  school  hours  or  at  a  time 
when  the  buildings  were  occupied  for  sciiool  func- 
tions, the  death  toll  would  have  been  horrif\ing.  If  the 
1971  San  Fernando  earthquake  had  occurred  during 
such  occupied  hours,  it  is  very  doubtful  whether  any 
deaths  would  have  occurred  in  any  public  school 
buildings  constructed  since  the  enactment  of  the  Field 
Act. 


'  Submitted  for  publication  July  5,  1972.  A  more  complete  re- 
port will  be  given  in  the  EERI/NOAA  report  on  this 
earthquake,  which  will  be  distributed  by  the  U.S.  Depart- 
ment of  Commerce. 

"Research  Director  and  Supervising  Structural  Engineer, 
Schoolhouse  Section,  California  Office  of  Architecture  and 
Construction. 


The  Field  Act  applies  only  to  public  school  build- 
ings through  all  grades,  up  to  and  including  junior  or 
community  college  level,  constructed  in  1933  or  later; 
it  does  not  apply  to  private  schools. 

The  Act,  found  in  Sections  15451  through  15465 
of  the  California  Education  Code,  requires  the  De- 
partment of  General  Services  to  approve  or  reject  the 
plans  and  supervise  the  construction  of  all  new  school 
buildings  regardless  of  cost  and  additions  and  altera- 
tions to  school  buildings  if  the  cost  of  such  work 
exceeds  $10,000.  Plans  must  be  prepared  by  an  archi- 
tect or  structural  engineer,  and  the  construction  must 
be  under  his  charge. 

The  Act  requires  continuous  construction  inspec- 
tion by  an  approved  inspector.  It  also  requires  all  those 
in  charge  of  construction  (the  architect,  structural 
engineer  and  other  professional  engineers,  the  inspec- 
tor, and  the  contractor)  to  provide  a  verified  state- 
ment indicating  that  the  construction  conforms  to 
the  approved  plans  and  specifications  in  every  particu- 
lar. The  Act  states  that  anyone  who  makes  a  false 
statement  in  the  verified  report  or  violates  any  of  the 
provisions  of  the  Act  is  guilty  of  a  felony.  The  Act 
also  requires  the  Departinent  of  General  Services,  if 
requested,  to  examine  existing  school  buildings  and 
report  on  their  structural  condition.  It  establishes  fees 
for  the  services  performed  by  the  State,  requires  the 
Department  to  adopt  regulations,  and  makes  other 
related  provisions. 

The  Schoolhouse  Section  of  the  Office  of  Archi- 
tecture and  Construction  in  the  Department  of  Gen- 
eral Services  provides  the  services  required  of  the 
State  by  the  Field  Act. 

All  public  school  plans  are  prepared  by  architects 
or  structural  engineers  in  the  private  sector,  and  the 
general  construction  supervisor  is  the  responsible 
charge  of  such  architects  or  structural  engineers.  The 
plans  and  construction  are  reviewed  by  structural  en- 
gineers in  the  State  Schoolhouse  Section.  The  plan 
review  is  rather  detailed,  whereas  the  construction  re- 
view is  rather  broad,  as  the  field  representatives  in 
the  Schoolhouse  Section  have  many  projects  simul- 
taneousK-  under  construction.  This  field  review  is,  in 
general,  an  extension  of  the  plan  review;  further,  the 
field  engineer  provides  many  other  services  to  the 
school  board. 

The  Field  Act  does  not  contain  building  regula- 
tions, but  it  does  require  the  California  State  Depart- 
ment of  General  Services  to  adopt  detailed  building

rcgularions.  These  regulations  are  published  in  Title 
24  Qilifornia  Administrative  Code.  Title  24,  CAC, 
contains  basic  building  regulations  which  arc  at  this 
time  basically  the  1970  Uniform  Building  Code  and 
are  applicable  to  all  State  buildings.  It  also  contains 
exceptions  to  the  basic  regulations  for  special  occu- 
pancies such  as  for  public  school  buildings.  Title  21, 
California  Administrative  Code,  contains  the  same 
special  building  regulations  gi\en  in  Title  24,  C.\C, 
applicable  to  public  school  buildings,  further,  it  con- 
tains testing  and  inspection  requirements  for  schools 
and  the  operational  regulations  adopted  to  enforce  the 
provisions  of  the  Field  Act. 

The  Field  Act  docs  not  apply  to  those  public 
school  buildings  constructed  prior  to  1933.  Recent 
legislation  revised  the  Garrison  Act,  Section  15503 
through  15518,  California  Fducation  Code,  to  require 
that  all  public  school  buildings  built  before  1933  have 
their  structural  condition  determined  by  January  1, 
1970.  If  found  unsafe,  the  buildings  cannot  be  used 
for  school  purposes  after  June  30,  1975,  unless  they 
have  been  rehabilitated  to  meet  the  requirements  of 
the  Field  Act.  The  law  absolves  the  school  board 
members  of  personal  liability,  if  prescribed  steps  are 
taken  to  alleviate  the  hazards. 

PUBLIC  SCHOOL  BUILDING  DAMAGE 
At  the  time  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake,  there 
were  110  masonr\-  buildings  in  use  by  the  Los  An- 
geles Unified  School  District  which  had  been  con- 
structed prior  to  the  enactment  of  the  Field  Act  and 
which  had  not  yet  been  strengthened  to  meet  those 
standards.  All  pre-Field  Act  buildings  in  this  district 
had  been  previously  examined,  and  the  worst  had 
been  replaced  or  strengthened  over  the  years.  This 
last  group  had  been  considered  to  be  the  best  of  the 
lot  and  were  scheduled  for  strengthening  in  the 
future. 

In  addition  to  the  110  masonry  buildings,  there 
were  53  wood-frame  buildings,  409  portable  buildings, 
and  3  bleachers  built  prior  to  the  Field  Act  which 
were  in  use.  .'\fter  the  San  Fernando  earthquake,  all 
of  these  pre-Field-Act  buildings  were  re-examined  by 
a  special  committee  of  leading  earthquake  engineering 
experts  who  recommended  that  some  buildings  be 
demolished  immediately  because  of  their  damage  or 
inherentK-  hazardous  construction,  that  some  buildings 
be  rehabilitated  for  continued  use,  and  that  some  build- 
ings be  abandoned  before  June  30,  1975.  Within  1'/: 
years  after  the  San  Fernando  earthquake,  the  Los 
.■\ngcles  Unified  School  District  had  removed  from 
service  or  rehabilitated  about  100  of  their  pre-Field- 
Act  school  buildings. 

ShortU-  after  the  earthquake,  all  school  buildings 
in  the  Los  .^ngcles  Unified  School  District  were  ex- 
amined. At  that  time,  there  were  over  660  schools, 
consisting  of  over  9200  individual  buildings.  The  ex- 
amination includeti  both  pre-Field-.\ct  buildings  and 
post-Field-Act  buildings.  This  examination  clearly 
showed  the  relari\cl\'  high  performance  of  the  post- 
Field-Act  buildings.  Major  structural  failures  and 
construction  defects  were  noted  in  the  pre-Field-Act 
buildings,  whereas  what  defects  there  were  in  most 


post-Field-Act  buildings  were  minor. 

The  most  common  type  of  damage  found  in  post- 
Field-Act  buildings  was  in  finish  materials.  Plaster  was 
cracked,  without  structural  significance,  merely  re- 
quiring patching  and  repainting;  ceiling  construction 
was  damaged,  and  parts  of  ceiling  materials  fell  to  the 
floor;  light  fixtures  were  damaged  or  fell  to  the  floor; 
mechanical  items  such  as  heaters,  air  conditioner  units, 
duct  \vork,  and  heater  grilles  were  displaced;  and 
equipment  on  shelves  was  thrown  to  the  floor.  A  few 
structural  defects  were  observed.

Information  in  table  2  indicates  the  amount  of  actual 
or  estimated  dollar  loss  to  all  public  school  districts  sur- 
rounding the  area  affected  by  the  earthquake.  Most  of 
the  values  given  in  table  2  are  contract  costs  of  the 
work;  however,  the  values  given  for  both  Los  .Angeles 
districts  are  estimates  made  shonly  after  the  earth- 
quake. The  contractual  costs  in  these  estimates  could 
be  reduced  if  a  less  costly  method  of  repair  can  be 
developed,  or  they  may  be  increased  if  additional  dam- 
age is  discovered  upon  opening  the  damaged  areas  of 
the  building  for  repairs. 

No  segregation  was  made  in  table  2  for  contracts 
or  estimates  for  minor  repairs  to  pre-Field-.Act  school 
buildings  and  post-Ficld-.Act  school  buildings;  there- 
fore, this  S2.9  million  loss  applies  to  both  pre  and  post- 
Field-Act  construction.  In  order  to  obtain  a  clearer 
picture  of  the  comparative  performance  of  the  two 
types  of  construction,  it  can  be  reported  that  the 
replacement  cost  of  six  pre-Field-Act  school  buildings 
damaged  in  the  Los  .-Xngeles  District  amounts  to  an 
additional  $10.3  million.  Thus  the  total  loss  of  pre- 
Field-Act  and  post-FieId-.\ct  public  school  buildings 
is  113.2  million. 

The  1969/70  estimated  value  of  all  buildings  and 
appurtenances  (not  including  land  cost)  in  the  Los 
Angeles  Unified  School  District  amounts  to  $850  mil- 
lion, with  an  additional  $100  million  for  equipment. 
Based  upon  these  figures,  the  Los  .Angeles  Unified 
School  District  had  an  estimated  1.3  percent  loss  of 
the  present  \alue  of  the  buildings  and  appurtenances. 
.Most  of  this  was  attributable  to  pre-Field-Act  building 
damage. 

Another  interesting  comparison  can  be  made  of 
the  loss  at  school  buildings  within  5  miles  of  the 
Pacoima  Dam.  There  are  19  public  schools  in  the  Los

Angeles  Unified  School  District  within  5  miles  of  the 
Pacoima  Dam.  The  estimated  costs  for  repair,  clean-up, 
etc.,  amount  to  |1  million.  This,  too,  includes  losses  at 
pre-Field-Act  and  post-Field-Act  schools.  The  esti- 
mated value  of  the  buildings  and  site  improvements 
(exxlusive  of  land)  amount  to  145  million.  Therefore, 
within  a  5-mile  radius  of  Pacoima  Dam,  the  public 
school  buildings  experienced  a  2.2  percent  loss  of  the 
present  estimated  value.  An  interesting  dollar  loss 
comparison  can  be  made  here.  Steinbrugge  and  others 
(1971,  p.  24)  reported  that,  in  an  area  some\\-hat  com- 
parable to  the  5-mile  radius  of  Pacoima  Dam,  there 
was  a  6.6  percent  loss  in  dwellings;  that  is,  in  the 
12,000  dwellings  investigated  by  the  team,  there  \vere 
$12.4  million  losses  in  a  total  dwelling  value  of  f  189.4 
million  e.xclusive  of  personal  property  losses  and  land 
value  losses.  A  sampling  of  over  1000  dwellings  by  the 
Los  .\ngeles  County  Assessor's  Office  revealed  a  21.5 
percent  loss. 

It  should  be  mentioned  here  that,  although  there 
Mas  considerable  damage  to  pre-Field-Act  public 
school  buildings  and  some  nominal  damage  to  post- 
Field-Act  public  school  buildings  in  the  stricken  area, 
no  public  school  building  collapsed  from  the  San 
Fernando   earthquake. 

BUILDING  DAMAGE  EXAMPLES 

Figure  1  shows  the  location  of  the  public  schools 

at  the  time  of  the  earthquake  and  the  other  locations 


mentioned  in  this  report.  It  should  be  noted  that  the 
public  schools  are  well  distributed  around  the  epi- 
center of  the  earthquake  and  throughout  the  affected 
area. 

Damage  results  from  various  sources  and  reasons. 
There  are  two  types  of  damage.  One  type  is  "struc- 
tural" damage  and  that,  as  the  name  implies,  applies 
to  the  damage  in  the  structure  or  the  load-carrving 
members.  The  other  type  of  damage  is  frequently 
termed  "non-structural"  damage.  .As  that  name  implies, 
covers  all  other  types  of  damage  found  in  the  finishes 
and  treatments  as  well  as  mechanical  and  electrical 
devices.  Basically,  there  are  two  sources  of  damage — 
one  source  is  from  the  vibrations  alone  and  the  other 
from  ground  fracturing,  separating,  or  thrustincr,  cou- 
pled \\ith  vibrational  damage.  Building  codes  gen- 
erally do  not  pro\-ide  for  ground  fracturing,  separat- 
ing, or  thrusting.  If  such  ground  failures  occur,  the 
building  certainly  cannot  restrict  the  whole  surround- 
ing geology  from  performing  in  its  natural  manner; 
however,  under  certain  conditions,  there  are  some 
design  precautions  which  can  be  exercised  to  reduce 
the  effects  of  such  an  event.  Building  codes,  ho^-ever, 
intend  to  provide  minimum  safeguards  based  upon 
economic  considerations  and  the  state  of  the  art  or 
level  of  knowledge.  Although  there  have  been  great 
strides  made  recently  in  earthquake  engineering,  there 
is  much  more  to  be  learned  concerning  this  very  com- 
plex subject.  A  few  specific  examples  of  the  general

type  of  damage  experienced  by  school  buildings  will

Los  Angeles  High  School 

Los  Angeles  High  School  is  more  than  20 
miles  from  the  Pacoima  Dam.  (1)  The  main  build- 
ing (photo  1)  on  this  high  school  site  was  a  pre-Field- 
Act  building  constructed  in  1917,  contained  about 
200,000  square  feet  of  floor  area  and  was  constructed 
of  wood  floors,  concrete  frames,  unreinforced  brick 
masonry  exterior  walls,  unreinforced  hollow  clay  tile

The  building  was  supported  by  spread  footings.  Two 
long  sections  of  the  parapet  and  adjacent  brick  veneer 
fell  off"  one  portion  (photo  2).  Portions  of  the  debris 
fell  through  the  lower  wood  roof  to  the  floor  below 
(photo  2).  Other  portions  fell  on  the  exit  stairway 
and  into  the  court  yard  area  (photo  3).  The  exterior

building  \\alls  were  heavily  cracked,  as  were  building 
interior  partitions;  light  fixtures  fell  to  the  floor;  and 
equipment  was  thrown  abo^jt.  Typical  interior  wall 
damage  is  sho\\"n  in  photos  4  and  5.  The  ^^'al!s  of  the 
chime  tower  were  heavily  damaged.  If  the  earthquake 
had  lasted  a  few  seconds  longer,  there  would  have 
been  much  greater  damage.  This  building  was  de- 
molished at  a  cost  of  about  $127,000;  the  replacement 
cost  will  be  more  than  S8  million.  There  was  no  dam- 
age to  the  many  post-Field-Act  school  buildings  at 
this  site. 

Morningside  Elementary  School 

.Momingside  Elementary  School  (2)  is  about  4 
miles  from  Pacoima  Dam  and  is  comprised  of  both 
pre-Field-Act  buildings  and  post-Field-.\ct  buildings. 
One  pre-Field-Act  building  constructed  in  1917  was 
rehabilitated  in  1964  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the 
Field  .^ct  (photo  6).  This  building  sustained  damage 
amounting  to  cracks  in  the  old  and  new  walls;  several 
roof  anchors  pulled  loose;  plaster  was  damaged 
throughout  the  building;  and  light  fixtures  fell.  The

estimated  cost  of  repair  to  this  building  was  about 
$69,000. 

The  other  pre-Fieid-Act  building  had  not  been 
rehabilitated.  Masonry  walls  throughout  the  building 
were  extensively  damaged  (photo  7).  The  parapets 
were  on  the  verge  of  falling  (photo  8).  Light  fixtures 
fell  or  were  displaced.  The  cost  to  demolish  this 
1 3,000-square-foot  building  is  estimated  at  about 
$13,000,  and  the  estimated  cost  to  replace  it  is  about 
$442,000.  The  present  value  of  the  buildings  and  site 
improvements  amounts  to  about  $1.4  million.

Van  Gogh  Street  Elementary  School 

Van  Gogh  Elementary  School  (3)  is  about  6^ 
miles  from  the  Pacoima  Dam.  This  school  was  con- 
structed in  1968  under  the  provisions  of  the  Field  Act. 
There  was  extensive  ground  cracking  throughout  the 
site  and  building  (photo  9).  Shortly  after  the  earth- 
quake, it  was  reported  that  the  site  would  be  aban- 
doned; however,  the  site  was  examined  geologically 
and  the  buildings  were  investigated  structurally,  re- 
sulting in  the  decision  to  repair  the  site  and  buildings 
and  continue  their  use.  The  site  is  on  the  flank  of  a

rather  broad  alluvial  fan,  and  it  is  believed  the  ground 
displacement  was  due  to  liquefaction.  Depth  of  the 
alluvium  is  unknown  but  exceeds  35  feet.  The  build- 
ing, which  is  supported  on  several  feet  of  recompacted 
soil  or  engineered  fill,  is  wood  frame  supported  by 
spread  footings.  Ground  cracking  caused  the  founda- 
tions and  slabs  on  grade  to  crack  (photo  10),  as  well 
as  the  walls  and  roof  (photo  11). 

One  wood  dragtie  in  the  roof  structure  broke  in 


tension  where  the  slope  of  grain  across  the  2-x-6-inch 
beam  was  about  1  in  5  or  6.  Light  fixtures  and  plaster 
were  damaged.  The  steel  tube  lunch-shelter  columns 
were  bent  several  inches  out  of  plumb.  A  4-foot-high 
retaining  wall  was  rotated  out  of  place,  and  the  stem 
failed  at  the  top  of  the  foundation  and  at  the  level  of 
the  adjacent  sidewalk.  Estimated  cost  to  repair  the  site 
and  building  was  $104,000.  The  present  value  of  site 
improvements  and  the  buildings  is  projected  to  be 
about  $1.2  million.

Hubbard  Street  Elementary  School 

Hubbard  Street  Elementary  School  (4)  is  the 
closest  school  to  the  Pacoima  Dam;  it  is  about  2  miles 
from  the  dam  and  less  than  a  mile  from  the  collapsed 
X'eterans  .Administration  Hospital.  The  ground  was 
nominally  cracked  as  indicated  in  photo  12.  The  build- 
ings, which  were  constructed  under  the  provisions  of 
the  Field  Act,  consist  of  classroom  buildings,  a  multi- 
purpose building,  and  several  bungalows,  all  of  wood- 
frame  construction.  The  primar\-  structural  damage  at 
the  site  consisted  of  as  much  as  6  inches  of  lateral 
displacement  of  the  wood-cripple-stud  walls  support- 
ing the  bungalows,  causing  the  plywood  to  loosen, 
separating  the  entry  porches,  and  breaking  the  gas 
lines.  In  several  areas,  acoustical  tile  fastened  to  the 
ceiling  with  adhesive,  fell  to  the  floor.  Over  half  the 
stem-mounted    light    fixtures    fell    or    were    partially 


down.  In  general,  the  buildings  were  in  good  struc- 
tural condition.  The  estimated  cost  for  debris  removal 
and  cleanup  was  $2,300;  the  estimate  for  minor  re- 
pairs to  building  and  site  was  $37,600  and  the  estimate 
for  loss  in  equipment  was  $1,800  for  a  total  estimated 
loss  of  $42,000.  The  present  value  of  site  improve- 
ments and  buildings  is  projected  to  be  about  $1.3 
million. 

Fenfon  Avenue  Elementary  School 

Fenton  Avenue  F.lcmentary  School  (5)  is  about  4 
miles  from  the  Pacoima  Dam  and  about  'g  mile  from 
the  Tujunga  .segment  of  the  San  Fernando  fault  zone. 
It  is  also  about  a  quarter  of  a  mile  from  the  Pacoima 
Lutheran  Hospital,  a  recently  constructed  building 
\\hich  was  so  damaged  that  it  was  vacated  and  later 
demolished.  The  Fenton  Avenue  School  site  showed 
some  nominal  ground  cracks.  There  was  very  little 
damage  to  the  school  buildings.  .-Ml  buildings  were 
built  under  the  provisions  of  the  Field  Act  and  consist 
of  classroom  buildings  (photo  13),  a  multi-purpose 
building,  and  bungalow  buildings.  All  construction 
was  of  wood  framing.  Damage  consisted  of  broken 
light  fixtures,  some  plaster  cracking,  and  slight  pound- 
ing between  the  arcade  steel  column  framing  and  the 
wood  building  construction  (photo  14).  Bungalows 
were  displaced  as  much  as  4  inches  Iaterall&gt;\  There 
was  essentially  no  structural  damage.  The  cost  estimate 
for  minor  repairs  to  buildings  and  site  amounted  to 
$4,600;  the  cost  for  repair  of  movable  equipment  was 
$20;  and  the  cost  for  textbooks  and  other  losses  was 
$900,  for  a  total  estimated  loss  of  $5,520.  The  present 
value  of  the  buildings  and  site  improvements  amounts 
to  over  $1  million. 

Sylmar  High  School 

Sylmar  High  School  (6)  is  about  3 '4  miles  from 
the  Pacoima  Dam.  The  site  had  a  great  deal  of  ground 
crackings  and  cracking  of  the  foundations  and  slabs 
on  grade.  It  is  estimated  roughh-  that  the  site  shorten- 
ed about  a  foot.  The  school  \\as  all  post-Field-Act 
construction.  .Ml  the  buildings  in  this  high  school  plant 
arc  of  one-story  wood  construction,  except  the  gym-

nasium  which  is  a  prestressed  concrete  folded-plate 
roof,  with  walls  of  reinforced  concrete,  resting  on 
concrete  piles.  The  gymnasium  floor  had  some 
settlement  and  two  roof  beams  were  spalled  a  bit  at  a 
cross  beam  used  to  support  gymnastic  equipment 
(photo  15).  This  cross  beam  was  added  after  the 
building  was  built  and  not  installed  under  Field  Act 
provisions.  No  damage  could  be  found  to  the  gym- 
nasium piles. 

There  was  considerable  damage  due  to  ground 
breakage.  Many  sidewalks  and  slabs  on  grade  were 
broken  throughout  the  site    (photo   16).  Equipment 


was  thrown  about;  light  fixtures  fell  to  the  floor  in 
several  rooms;  plaster  was  cracked  and  fell;  and  ar- 
cades pounded  together  at  the  joints  and  librar\-  books 
were  thrown  from  the  shelves  (photo  17).  A  large 
retaining  wall  rotated  about  8  inches.  A  flag  pole  bent 
at  the  first  lower  welded  point  (photo  18),  and  a 
flood-light  pole  bent  at  the  upper  welded  joint.  This 
site  sustained  the  greatest  amount  of  damage  which 
was  primarily  due  to  the  ground  cracking  and  dis- 
placement, of  any  post-Field-Act  construction.  The 
estimated  cost  for  the  repairs  to  the  building  and  site 
was  about  $485,000;  the  cost  for  debris  removal  was

b&gt;-  the  S\'lmar  Disaster  Committee  for  several  meet- 
ings and  by  the  Los  Angeles  Department  of  Water 
and  Power  as  a  temporary  garage  and  storage  facility 
for  a  month  following  the  earthquake.  The  present 
value  for  the  buildings  and  site  improvements  is  a  bit 
over  $5  million.

is  about  7  miles  northwest  of  the  Pacoima  Dam  in  the 
Newhall-Solemint  area  and  about  2'/:  miles  from  the 
epicenter.  All  buildings  were  built  under  the  provi-

Steel;  the  exterior  was  of  reinforced,  grouted,  brick 
masonry.  The  site  contained  some  ground  cracks 
(photo  19).  Light  cracking  occurred  at  the  corners 
of  the  reinforced,  grouted,  brick-masonry  walls  where 
steel  beams  were  anchored  to  these  walls  (photo  20). 
When  repairs  were  made  to  these  beam-wall  connec- 
tions, it  was  noted  that  the  construction  details  did 
not  conform  to  the  details  shown  on  the  plans;  that 
is,  certain  welds  and  anchor  bolt  ties  were  omitted. 
Ceiling  and  light  fixtures  became  unraveled  (photo 
21).  There  arc  five  schools  in  this  school  district.  All 
school  buildings  are  post-Field-.Act  construction,  and 
the  total  contractual  cost  for  the  repair  of  damage  in 
this  district  amounted  to  $42,212.

CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS 
This  earthquake  clearly  brought  out  the  differ- 
ence in  the  performance  of  pre-Field-Act  buildings 
and  post-Field-Act  buildings.  Obviously,  pre-Field- 
Act  buildings  can  be  very  hazardous.  Fortunately,  the 
strong  earthquake  motion  for  this  moderate  earthquake 
lasted  only  about  12  seconds,  as  recorded  at  Pacoima 
Dam.  Aluch  greater  damage  Mould  have  occurred  if 


the  duration  of  motion  had  been  longer  or  if  the  epi- 
center had  been  closer  to  the  buildings. 

Although  this  report  is  directed  to  the  perform- 
ance of  public  .school  buildings  in  this  earthquake, 
many  buildings  constructed  in  the  era  prior  to  the 
enactment  of  the  Field  Act  (which  applies  only  to 
public  school  buildings)  \\erc  constructed  to  the  same 
or  similar  standards  and  these  other  buildings  could  be 
equally  hazardous.  In  the  interest  of  public  safety, 
all  hazardous  buildings  should  be  examined  and  cor- 
rected by  competent  personnel. 

If  less  non-structural  damage  is  desired  in  such 
items  as  light  fixtures,  ceilings,  glass,  and  other  archi- 
tectural treatments  as  well  as  mechanical  or  electrical 
equipment — more  consideration  must  be  given  to  the 
internal  design  and  construction  of  such  fixtures  and 
to  their  methods  of  anchorage.  Such  damage  and  haz- 
ards can  be  reduced  with  little  additional  cost  to  the 
total  project. 

Much  more  research  is  needed  in  the  field  of 
earthquake  engineering.  There  is  much  work  to  be 
done.  Rspecially  needed  are  more  strong-motion  earth- 
quake records  on  all  types  of  geologic  and  soil  con- 
ditions *,  and  in  engineering  structures;  also  needed  is 
the  construction  of  a  complete  three-component  earth- 
quake-motion platform  to  reproduce  strong  earth- 
quake motion.  Such  facilities  as  the  "shaking  platform" 
will  permit  testing  large  assemblies  of  various  types  of 
man-made  construction  under  completely  controlled 
conditions.  It  is  also  important  to  visit  sites  of  strong 
earthquake  motion  with  the  view  of  revising  and 
enforcing  building  regulations. 

One  of  the  reasons  the  post-Field-Act  public 
school  buildings  performed  so  well  was  the  require-

nicnt  for  continuous  inspection  to  assure  that  the 
actual  construction  complies  with  the  designer's  in- 
tent. This  is  performed  in  r\vo  ways  as  required  by 
the  Field  Act.  One,  is  by  the  architect  and  structural 
engineers  who  periodically  visit  the  building  during 
all  stages  of  construction  to  assure  that  their  de- 
sign intent  is  carried  out,  and  the  other  is  lay 
the  inspectors  at  the  project  who  continuously  in- 
spect for  compliance  with  the  contract  documents. 
Good  building  regulations  and  plans  are  valueless  if 
construction  does  not  conform  to  their  requirements. 
Good  inspection  assists  the  contractor  in  performing 
his  duties  and  provides  assurance  to  the  owner.  In- 
spection of  buildings  after  the  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake revealed  errors  in  construction  which  indicate 
that  inspection  procedures  must  be  improved  or  ap- 
plied  more   consistently.    Another    reason   the    post- 


Field-Act  buildings  performed  well  is  the  required 
independent  review  of  the  plans  and  specifications,  by 
competent  personnel,  for  conformance  with  the 
adopted  building  regulations.  Actually,  there  is  very 
little  difference  between  the  building  code  adopted 
for  public  school  buildings  and  those  codes  adopted 
by  local  agencies.  There  is,  however,  a  difference  in 
enforcement. 

Some  structural,  vibrational  damage  occurred 
which  substantiates  the  point  that  the  adopted  build- 
ing regulations  arc  not  overly  conservative.  Interested 
technical  groups  are  studying  the  effects  of  the  earth- 
quake in  order  to  propose  revisions  to  the  building 
regulations.  Several  code  revisions  have  been  or  are 
in  the  process  of  being  adopted  by  various  enforcing 
agencies. 


CHAPTER  27 


Highway  Damage  in  the 
San  Fernando  Earthquake ' 

by  California  Division  of  Highways' 


The  area  affected  by  the  earthquake  lies  in  the 
northwestern  San  Fernando  Valley  immediately  south 
of  the  San  Gabriel  Mountains  in  the  Transverse 
Ranges  of  Southern  California. 

Major  road  damage  was  concentrated  within  an 
area  of  12  square  miles  in  the  northern  San  Fernando 
X'alley  and  involved  about  10  miles  of  freeway.  The 
heaviest  concentration  of  road  damage  occurred  at 
the  Route  5/210  (Golden  State/Foothill  Freeway) 
Interchange  and  along  the  completed  5-mile  portion 
of  Interstate  Route  210.  Portions  of  Interstate  Routes 
5  and  405  (San  Diego  Freeway)  and  State  Routes  2 
and  14  also  sustained  moderate  to  heavy  damage.* 

FREEWAY  DAMAGE 

On  Route  5,  damage  extended  from  the  Mission 
separation  structure  to  the  Santa  Clara  River  over- 
head structure.  The  heaviest  concentration  of  damage 
occurred  between  the  Route  5/405  Interchange  and 
5/14  Interchange.  Damage  to  the  roadway  consisted 
of  settlement  at  bridge  approaches  and  buckling, 
heaving,  and  cracking  of  concrete  pavement  at  various 
locations.  Fill  was  distorted  in  some  of  the  higher 
bridge  approaches,  and  two  slides  occurred  in  cut 
slopes  between  Balboa  Boulevard  and  Route  14.  Dam- 
age to  structures  ranged  from  minor  cracking  and 
spalling  of  joints  to  total  destruction  of  several  bridges. 
The  bulk  of  the  damage  occurred  within  the  limits  of 
two  construction  contracts,  one  that  included  the 
Route  5/14  Interchange  and  a  second  that  included 
the  Route  5/210  Interchange. 

On  Route  14,  the  damage  extended  from  the 
Route  5/14  Interchange  to  the  Santa  Clara  River.  The 
major  damage  was  concentrated  in  the  Route  5/14 
Interchange  area  which  was  under  construction  at  the 
time  of  the  quake.  There  was  damage  to  all  structures, 
again  ranging  from  minor  cracking  and  spalling  to  the 
loss  of  complete  portions  of  bridges.  The  damage  on

Route  14  at  the  easterly  end  consisted  of  settlement  of 
approaches,  offsetting  of  alignment,  and  minor  crack- 
ing and  spalling  of  both  the  Solemint  and  Santa  Clara 
River  Bridges.  There  \\'as  no  particular  damage  to  the 
roadway  on  Route  14  (the  new  freeway  roadways  for 
this  project  had  not  been  completed). 

On  Route  210,  there  was  damage  to  both  road- 
way and  structures  throughout  the  completed  portion 
of  this  freeway,  \\hicii  extended  from  its  intersection 
with  Route  5  to  the  Maclay  Street  separation  struc- 
ture. Throughout  this  total  area,  the  freeway  settled 
on  a  somewhat  uniform  grade  line.  The  effect  was 
obvious  at  bridges,  where  the  settlement  ranged  from 
6  inches  to  approximately  2  feet,  with  the  greatest  dis- 
tortion on  the  easterly  end  of  the  project.  Pavement 
was  buckled,  broken,  and  separated  for  several  hun- 
dred feet  each  side  of  the  structures.  The  sides  of  fills 
were  distorted.  Structural  damage  ranged  from  minor 
damage  to  wing  walls  and  slope  paving  to  rotation  and 
settlement  of  abutments,  spalling  and  cracking  of 
columns,  and  displacement  of  wing  walls.  The  street 
sections  beneath  the  various  undercrossings  had  dam- 
aged curbs,  sidewalks,  slope  paving  and  some  cracking 
of  roadway  sections. 

On  Route  405,  damage  extended  from  San  Fer- 
nando Mission  Boulevard  undercrossing  to  the  inter- 
section with  Route  5.  Damage  consisted  of  settlement 
at  bridge  approaches,  buckling  and  breaking  of  pave- 
ment as  on  the  other  routes,  and  relatively  minor  dam- 
age to  the  bridge  abutments  and  wing  walls. 

On  Route  2,  the  damage  was  confined  to  a  series 
of  small  slides  although  fill  settled  and  pavement  was 
cracked  in  one  place.  The  damage  extended  from  ap- 
proximately 2  to  6  miles  east  of  La  Caiiada.

EmergcncN-  repair  work  and  construction  of 
detours  through  the  damaged  area  cost  about  $1,- 
640,000.  Permanent  restoration  of  the  freeway-  facili- 
ties will  cost  about  $12,100,000  including  about  $6,- 
400,000  to  restore  the  bridges  and  $5,700,000  for  all 
other  facilities.  These  figures  do  not  include  engineer- 
ing costs  and  may  be  increased  if  hidden  damages  are 
uncovered  during  reconstruction. 

CUT  SLOPES 

Se\eral  slides  in  cut  slopes  were  caused  by  the 
quake.  The  three  largest  slides  occurred  on  construc- 
tion projects  but  would  have  had  little  effect  on  the 
traveled  wa\'  even  if  the  road  had  been  in  service.  One 
exception  was  a  bedding  plane  failure  on  Route  5. 
This  slide,  shown  in  photo  I,  would  have  blocked 
Ramp  "V"  which  is  designed  to  connect  southbound 
traffic  from  Route  14  with  San  Fernando  Road.  The 
other  two  slides  (one  of  which  had  previously  shown 
a  tendency  to  slide)  de\eloped  in  the  upper  portions 


of  the  slopes  and  did  not  collapse  completely.  Moderate 
to  large  volumes  of  earth  materials  were  involved  in 
the  three  larger  slides. 

Smaller  slides  were  much  less  spectacular.  Some 
moved  so  slightly  that  the&gt;'  were  not  detected  during 
the  initial  damage  survey.  These  slides,  however,  did 
affect  the  traveled  waj'  by  thrusting  the  pavement 
sections  up,  causing  diagonal  and  longitudinal  cracks 
and  raising  portions  of  the  pavement  noticeably. 

The  behavior  of  cut  slopes  depended  upon  the  type 
of  material  in  the  slope.  For  example:  slopes  in  dense, 
stiff,  brittle  materials  (silts  and  silty  sands  containing 
enough  nonplastic  fine  material  to  have  become  desic- 
cated enough  to  appear  cemented)  fractured  and  shat- 
tered badly  over  distances  of  20  to  30  feet  behind 
the  top  of  the  cut  and  often  in  the  face  itself.  Ex- 
amples are  shown  in  photos  2  and  3.  Materials  of 
moderate  density  and  a  slightly  greater  moisture  con- 
tent showed  far  fewer  cracks  and  no  shattering.  Often 
onl&gt;-  one  or  two  large  cracks  were  found  along  the

slope  top.  Slopes  in  loose  materials  cracked  behind  the 
slope  (where  the  surface  was  desiccated)  in  a  parallel 
pattern,  and  the  slope  moved  succcssiveh-  in  small 
amounts  at  each  crack  toward  the  unsupported  sur- 
face. This  type  of  material  also  sloughed  and  slumped 
in  the  slope  face. 

Overall  cut-slope  performance  was  considered 
very  good  from  the  standpoint  of  slide  development — 
most  slopes  did  not  fail,  even  during  strong  ground 
motion — although  three  major  slides  did  occur  in 
very  large  cuts.  The  potential  damage  from  large-cut 
slope  failures  is  very  real,  however;  and  large  cuts 
should  be  evaluated  by  geologists  and  engineers  for 
their  failure  potential  in  high  earthquake-risk  areas. 


EMBANKMENTS  AND  FILL  DAMAGE 

Embankments  were  damaged  in  several  ways,  in- 
cluding shear  failure,  subsidence  due  to  dcnsification, 
spreading,   and    longitudinal   and    transverse   cracking

caused  b\^  ground  motion. 

Fill  damage  caused  by  foundation  soil  response 
to  the  earthquake  consisted  of  (I)  subsidence  due  to 
the  more  pronounced  dcnsification  of  looser  under- 
lying sands  and  gravel  and  (2)  slipouts  initiated  in  the 
weaker,  fine-grained  soils.  No  reasonable  treatment 
outside  the  scope  of  current  procedures  is  available  for 
these  problems.  For  example,  the  foundation  failure 
on  Route  5  resulted  in  a  vertical  subsidence  of  only 
1  foot  and  even  less  lateral  movement.  The  lack  of 
greater  movement  indicates  that  the  foundation  ma- 
terial had  good  strength  prior  to  the  quake. 

Differential  movement  at  abrupt  cut/fill  contacts 
resulted  in  transverse  cracks  and  vertical  displace- 
ments across  the  pavement.  For  very  shallow  fills,  the 
problem  was  minor. 

The  type  of  damage  most  often  observed  was 
subsidence  due  to  vibrator\-  dcnsification  by  earth- 
quake shaking  of  fill  and  foundation  materials,  both 
of  which  consist  of  nonplastic  silt\",  gravelly  sands 
except  at  a  few  locations.  Subsurface  soils  (earth 
materials")  were  densified,  not  only  under  fills,  but  in 
areas  outside  the  influence  of  added  fill  weight. 
Greater  dcnsification  did  occur  under  the  fills,  how-

ever,  especially  at  locations  where  the  materials  were 
very  loose  prior  to  the  quake.  Generally,  earthquake 
densification  of  foundation  materials  resulted  in  much 
greater  fill  subsidence  than  densification  of  the  fill 
itself  because  the  deposits  of  alluvium  affected  by  the 
ground  vibrations  w  ere  in  a  looser  pre-quake  condition 
than  the  fill  and  are  substantially  thicker  at  most  loca- 
tions than  is  the  fill. 

The  contribution  of  subsurface  soil  (natural 
foundation  materials)  densification  to  fill  subsidence 
can  casil&gt;-  be  detected  at  locations  where  ripid  inclu- 
sions in  natural  ground  pass  under  the  fills.  This  type 
of  differential  subsidence  occurred  at  the  Polk  Street/ 
210  Interchange  and  on  Route  5,  just  north  of  Rinaldi 
Street.  At  both  locations,  a  reinforccd-concrete-box 
drainage  channel  was  crossed  by  fills  about  25  feet 
thick.  Differential  subsidence  resulted  from  the  earth- 
quake, and  a  ridge  or  high  area  in  the  roadway  sur- 
face was  created  over  the  non\ielding  inclusion.  Af, 
the  fill  on  either  side  of  the  rigid  element  subsided, 
shear  cracks  were  formed  in  the  fill  slope,  beginning 
at  the  toe  and  extending  up  the  slope  face.  Where  the 
movement  was  relatively  small,  the  cracks  extended 
only  about  half  wa&gt;-  up  the  slope.  As  total  subsidence 


increased,  the  cracks  continued  to  develop  and  ex- 
tended across  the  roadu  ay.  Some  were  and  some  were 
not  reflected  in  the  paxement  section  but  could  be 
observed  in  unpaved  medians  and  shoulders. 

Some  spreading  of  fills  near  structures  was  asso- 
ciated with  densification  within  the  fill  proper  due  to 
the  tendency-  for  movement  toward  unsupported  sur- 
faces. This  type  of  spreading  in  the  fill  proper  was 
minimal,  fairK-  uniform  and  confined  for  the  most 
part  to  the  ends  of  approach  fills  under  bridges.  Fill 
spreading  caused  by  lateral  movement  in  foundation 
soils  during  densification  was  observed  at  a  few  loca- 
tions bur  was  limited  in  amount  due  to  the  inherent 
high  shear  strength  of  foundation  soils.  This  resulted 
in  bulging  in  the  lower  half  of  fill  slopes  and  forma- 
tion of  longitudinal  tension  cracks  in  the  upper  half 
as  the  fill  subsided  differentiall\-  in  a  plane  normal  to 
centerlinc.  Enough  lateral  movement  near  the  fill  toe 
at  some  locations  caused  minor  thrusting  of  inside 
curb  and  gutter  sections  of  freeway  ramps.  .^Iso,  as 
the  fills  subsided,  the  lateral  component  of  slope 
paving  movement  sheared  and  rotated  the  curbs  along 
the  surface  streets  under  the  freeway  structures,  as 
shown  in  photo  4.

Slipouts  (earth  slides  in  embankments)  varying 
in  size  and  amount  of  movement  occurred  in  fills  at 
several  locations.  iMaximum  movement  was  small 
(inches,  or  a  few  feet)  but  was  sufficient  to  cause 
differential  vertical  displacements  at  longitudinal  joints 
in  pavement  slabs  (photo  5),  diagonal  cracks  across 
the  pavement  at  the  flanks,  and  minimal  thrusting  near 
the  toe.  Larger  movements  were  prevented  by  the  high 
strength  of  fill  and  foundation  materials.  The  larger 
slipouts  underwent  the  greatest  movement  and  were 
observed  to  have  occurred  in  lf&gt;ng  fills,  all  of  which 
M-ere  20-30  feet  high.  The  smaller  slipouts  often 
underwent  very  little  movement  and  in  some  cases 
were  difficult  to  detect.  They  usually  occurred  in 
fills  crossing  small  ravines  and  developed  because  of 
differential  response  by  fill  and  natural  ground.  Conse- 
quently, lateral  limits  of  these  slides  generall\'  followed 
the  cut/fill  contact. 

Three  fill  slipouts  caused  by  plastic-type  move- 
ments in  fine-grained  compressible  foundation  soils 
occurred  within  one  fairly  small  area  on  Route  5  just 
east  of  the  Lower  Van  Norman  Lake.  These  slipouts 
involved    more    vertical    and    lateral    movement    than 


those  occurring  in  fills  only.  The  portion  of  fill  under- 
going movement  dropped  a  maxiiuum  f)f  1  to  1.5  feet. 
Lateral  movement  was  somewhat  less  due  to  the  rota- 
tional effect,  but  large  cracks  up  the  fill  slope  were 
formed  at  the  flanks.  These  slipouts  covered  a  larger 
portion  of  the  roadw  ay  than  those  in  fills  only. 

The  over-all  effect  of  fill  subsidence  was  a  loss 
in  roadwa\'  profile  at  cut/fill  contacts  and  bridges.  In 
some  cases,  espcciallv  at  bridges,  this  abrupt  change 
in  profile  was  large  enough  to  prevent  traffic  from 
using  the  road.  In  some  other  cases,  the  bump  at 
bridge  approaches  was  accentuated  but  traffic  could 
still  use  the  facility. 

Damage  to  fills  with  respect  to  shear  failure  was 
considered  minor  despite  the  fact  that  three  slipouts  did 
dcxelop  in  ver\'  good  material.  I^his  suggests  that  high 
fills  should  be  evaluated  for  their  failure  potential  in 
high  earthquake-risk  areas.  Subsidence  due  to  densifi- 
cation  within  tiie  fill  cannot  be  eliminated  entirely 
and  can  be  reduced  only  by  keeping  fill  iicights  as 
low  as  practical.  It  is  ver\'  doubtful  whether  increased 
compaction  beyond  that  prcsentK'  required  would  be 
cconomicallv  desirable.

BRIDGE  APPROACHES 

\\'idcsprcad  settlement  at  bridge  approaches  oc- 
curred on  all  freeways  surv-c&gt;ed  for  damage.  This 
[&gt;rol)lcm  varied  according  to  distance  from  the 
lieavil\-  damaged  area  and  stage  of  construction  of  the 
road.  For  example,  on  existing  Routes  5  and  405  south 
of  the  Mission  Hills,  the  problem  clearK-  affected  the 
"rideabilitv",  especially  on  Route  405,  even  after 
aspiialtic  concrete  patciics  were  hastily  placed  at  ap- 
proaches to  relieve  the  abruptness  of  changes  in  pro- 
file, .^n  important  factor  is  that  settlement  was  not  so 
great  as  to  prevent  traffic  from  using  the  facilities 
without  further  repair  work.  The  effect  was  much 
worse  on  Route  210,  which  was  closed  to  traffic  for 
(]uitc  a  long  period,  as  there  were  differences  in  road- 
w  a\-  profile  in  excess  of  1  foot  at  some  bridge  ap- 
proaches (photos  6,  7,  8). 

Settlement  at  approaches  is  the  result  of  subsi- 
dence of  embankments  and  structural  backfill  material. 
.Although  the  backfill  material  subsides  more  due  to 
dcnsification  than  the  fill  itself,  it  is  usualh'  the  fill  and 


nor  the  structural  backfill  that  is  the  principal  cause 
of  the  problem.  This  is  because  of  the  bridging  action 
of  the  reinforced-concrete  approach  slab  which  is  sup- 
ported at  the  bridge  deck  b\'  the  paving  notch  and  at 
its  other  end  by  fill  material.  The  slab  acts  as  a  ramp 
up  to  and  down  from  the  bridge  deck.  The  fact  that 
the  slal)  is  unsupported  b\-  the  structural  backfill  be- 
comes important  onl\-  if  the  slab  (1)  falls  off  the 
paving  notch,  (2)  fails  by  cracking,  or  (3)  is  of  in- 
sufficient length  to  provide  adequate  bearing  area  on 
the  fill.  If  an\'  of  the  three  conditions  exists  or  occurs, 
the  situation  is  worsened  and  it  first  appears  that  the 
structural  backfill  only  is  entirel\-  responsible  for  the 
problem  instead  of  merely  contributing  to  it. 

THE  PAVEMENT  SECTION 

Damage  to  the  pavement  section  was  found  to 
depend  almost  entirely  on  the  response  of  underl\ing 
materials  to  the  ground  motion  and  shocks  generated 
b\'  the  quake.  The  most  prevalent  types  of  damage 
consisted  f)f  lateral  and  longitudinal  separation  between

San  Fernando  Earthquake — Damage

Portland  cement  concrete  (PCC)  slabs  at  joints,  differ- 
ential vertical  movement  and  resulting  loss  of  pave- 
ment plane,  transverse  and  diagonal  cracking,  and 
buckling  at  compression  zones. 

Separation  between  slabs  with  no  detectable  loss 
of  constructed  roadway  plane  was  usually  small  and 
resulted  from  the  response  of  fills  to  ground  shaking. 
Some  of  the  slabs  separated  by  moving  over  the  ce- 
ment treated  base  (CTB)  which  remained  uncracked. 
Other  of  the  PCC  slabs  and  CTB  remained  bonded 
together  but  moved  due  to  cracks  developed  in  the 
CTB.  Separation  without  crack  development  in  the 
CTB  probably  resulted  from  ground  shocks  suffi- 
cientlv'  large  to  break  the  bond  between  the  slab  and 
base.  This  type  of  separation  was  infrequent  since  in 
most  instances  slab  separation  resulted  from  another 
type  of  damage  or  response. 

Slab  separation  was  generally  accompanied  by 
differential  vertical  movements  over  areas  of  various 
sizes.  Actual  relative  vertical  and  horizontal  move- 
ments between  any  two  adjacent  slabs  were  often 
quite  small  and,  at  some  locations,  even  difficult  to 
observe  except  from  certain  vantage  points.  Neverthe- 
less, the  paving  plane  was  disrupted  and  could  be  felt 
when  driving  over  the  affected  slabs  at  freeway  speeds. 
These  differential  vertical  movements  occurred  mostly 
in  fill  sections  where  the  underlying  fill  material  had 
subsided  and  created  a  dip,  but  some  were  noted  in 
cut  sections  \\  here  the  slabs  had  been  raised  due  to  an 
upthrusting  action  at  the  toe  of  potential  slides  involv- 
ing the  cut  slope. 

Slab  separation  accompanied  b\-  differential  ver- 
tical displacements  along  longitudinal  joints  was  noted 


at  a  few  locations  in  fill  sections.  These  were  locations 
of  well-delineated  slipouts  within  the  fill.  If  enough 
movement  had  occurred  within  the  slipout  delineation, 
diagonal  cracks  across  slabs  were  in  evidence. 

Slab  cracking  at  locations  other  than  joints  re- 
sulted from  relative  movement  along  the  contact  be- 
tween cut  and  fill.  Where  original  ground  was  very 
steep,  movement  was  practically  vertical  and  no  dif- 
ferential horizontal  movement  along  the  crack  was 
noted.  Separation  along  joints  was  noted  at  some  places 
but  was  apparently  absent  at  others. 

Diagonal  cracks  not  associated  with  slipout  delinea- 
tions resulted  from  differential  lateral  movement  of 
underlying  materials  such  as  the  Juvenile  Hall  slide. 
This  t\pe  of  cracking  was  generally  accompanied  by 
rotational-type  slab  separation  at  joints  on  eitiier  side 
of  the  diagonal  shear  crack. 

The  separation  of  slabs  in  the  vicinity  of  separation 
structures  is  believed  to  have  been  partly  caused  by 
the  action  of  the  structure  being  transmitted  through 
the  approach  slabs  to  the  pavement  slabs,  especially 
near  those  structures  that  experienced  the  more  violent 
motion. 

The  remaining  type  of  damage  to  the  pavement 
section  consists  of  compression  buckles  (photos  9,  10, 
11).  This  phenomenon  occurred  almost  exclusively  in 
at-grade  sections,  the  one  exception  being  in  cut  along 
the  line  of  contact  between  bedded  sediments  and  al- 
knium.  This  type  of  damage  is  believed  to  result  from 
compressional  shortening  within  natural  ground. 

Faulting  due  to  tectonic  activity  resulted  in 
slight-to-moderate  road  damage.  The  San  Fernando 
fault  zone,  for  example,  crossed  routes  210,  5,  and  405

almost  normal  to  roadMa\s  at  locations  sufficiently  re- 
moved from  separation  structures  that  no  damage  to 
bridges  resulted.  Tiie  fault  crossed  Routes  5  and  40.'&gt; 
immediatcl\-  south  of  their  junction  (just  east  of  the 
Lower  Van  Norman  Dam),  where  both  roadways  are 
in  cut,  and  resulted  in  ver\-  minor  breakage  in  the 
pavement  section.  The  thrusting  effect,  however,  did 
disrupt  the  pavement  profile  as  the  north  side  of  the 
fault  break  moved  up  relative  to  the  south  side.  The 
break  in  roadwav  profile  was  not  serious  and  was 
feathered  in  fairly  easil\-  with  asphalt  cement  (.-XC) 
patching.  The  fault  crossed  Route  210  about  550  feet 
west  of  the  Maclay  Avenue  undercrossing  at  a  loca- 
tion where  the  roadway  was  almost  at  grade.  Up- 
thrusting  of  the  north  side  was  more  pronounced  than 
at  the  Routes  5  and  405  fault  trace,  and  a  mucii  wider 
zone  was  affected  as  shown  in  transverse  cracks  in 
pavement  slabs  and  separation  and  vertical  displace- 
ments of  slabs  at  joints.  Damage  was  more  severe  than 
at  the  Routes  5  and  405  fault  trace  due  to  the  greater 
relative  vertical  movement  at  the  main  fault  trace  and 
the  longer  lengths  of  pavement  w  ithin  the  fault  zone. 


Only  two  locations  on  Route  14  roadbed  settled 
sufficiently  to  require  repair  work:  namely,  the  ap- 
proaches to  the  Solemint  Overliead  Bridge  and  the 
Santa  Clara  River  Bridge. 

Damage  to  Foothill  Boulevard  consisted  of  nu- 
merous cracks  of  varying  width  in  the  .\C  pavement; 
vertical  displacement  at  .\C  pavement  cracks;  broken 
sections  of  curb,  gutter,  sidewalk,  and  driveways; 
minor  cracking  and  spalling  of  catch  basins;  and  dras- 
tic upheaval  of  the  pavement,  curb,  gutter,  and  side- 
w  alk  at  two  locations.  Some  of  the  damage  was  caused 
by  surface  fault  displacement;  and  some,  b\-  failure  of 
embankments  or  cut  slopes. 

DRAINAGE  STRUCTURES 
Damage  to  drainage  structures  was  largely  de-

fairly  minor  damage  observed  was  crackins  in  con- 
crete licadwalls,  as  shown  in  photo  12. 

One  of  the  most  serious  problems  involving  dam- 
age to  drainage  structures  w  as  differential  movement 
which  affected  invert  profiles.  .\t  most  locations  of 
pipes  under  fills,  the  sags  in  profiles  resulted  from 
foundation  subsidence.  At  some  locations  it  appeared 
that  flow  directions  ma\-  ha\e  been  reversed. 

Inspection  of  major  drainage  structures  in  the 
earthquake  affected  area  on  Routes  .^,  405,  210,  and  14 
revealed  considerable  damage  resulting  in  hairline 
cracks  longinidinall\-  and  transver.selv  or  peripherally 
due  to  seismic  effects  and  disturbance  of  soils.  The 
distress  in  the  embankments,  due  to  severity  of  the 
earthiiuakc  disturbance,  caused  excessive  stresses  on 
these  structures  and  resulted  in  damage  to  reinforced 
concrete  pipes,  lK)\es,  and  inlet  structures. 

Inspection  of  the  reinforced-concrcte  boxes 
showed  certain  similarities  of  distress.  There  were 
three  and  sometimes  four  longitudinal  cracks  in  the 


range  of  0.002-inch  and  1/6-inch  width  going  down 
the  middle  of  the  exterior  walls  and  at  the  "spring" 
line,  half  way  above  the  invert.  There  were  '/i-inch 
and  .V  16-inch  cracks  at  the  top  and  bottom  of  the 
exterior  and  middle  walls  of  boxes,  and  spalling  with 
exposed  rebar  was  noticeable  at  several  of  the  joints. 

Similarly,  there  was  considerable  hairline  crack- 
ing in  the  pipe  culverts.  Most  of  the  cracking  was 
nearly  horizontal  (continuous)  about  3  or  4  feet  "above 
the  invert.  Both  sides  of  the  pipe  were  cracked.  In 
addition,  there  were  numerous  transverse  cracks  ex- 
tending above  and  below  the  horizontal  cracks  at 
almost  every  pipe  joint. 

.■\t  the  Route  5/210  Interchange  area,  an  87-inch 
reinforced-concrete  pipe  \\as  fractured  to  the  extent 
that  the  reinforcing  steel  was  exposed.  A  208-foot 
length  of  the  pipe  was  severely  damaged,  requiring 
a  protective  steel  liner  plate  inside.  This'damaged  por- 
tion had  spalling  with  rebars  exposed,  twisted,  and/or 
sheared.  Cracks  varying  from  3/16-  to  J^-inch  width

with  displacement  as  much  as  1  Vi  to  2  inches  was 
noticeable  at  the  joints.  The  remaining  portions  of 
the  pipe  could  be  repaired  by  injecting  epoxy  adhe- 
sive under  pressure  into  the  cracks  and  epoxy  grouting 
the  spalled  transverse  joints. 

A  42-inch  corrugated  steel  pipe  also  sustained 
severe  joint  separation  in  this  area.  It  was  believed  that 
this  pipe  could  be  repaired  without  replacement.  Sev- 
eral of  the  drop  inlets  in  the  area  were  badly  cracked, 
and  some  were  tilted  to  the  e.xtent  that  the  connecting 
pipes  \\ere  broken.  Several  of  the  drop  inlets  and  con- 
necting pipes  appeared  to  require  replacement. 

A  39-inch  reinforced-concrete  pipe  near  the  Olive 
View  Hospital  on  Route  210  was  severely  disjointed 
and  offset.  Several  vertical  corrugated-steel  pipe  risers 


from  cross  culverts  to  drop  inlets  were  badl\'  distorted, 
although  it  appeared  that  only  one  \\'ould  require  re- 
placement. 

Inspection  of  an  84-inch  unreinforced,  cast-in- 
place  concrete  pipe,  located  to  the  east  of  Route  5 
and  south  of  Roxford  Avenue  approximately  3.'i  feet 
east  of  the  toe  of  the  freeway  fill,  revealed  considerable 
damage  due  to  the  soil  disturbance.  Cracks  as  wide  as 
'/8  inch  were  noticeable  in  the  4,  10,  2,  and  7  o'clock 
positions.  The  inside  surface  of  the  pipe  was  dislocated 
with  'X-  to  '/i-inch  offset  along  these  fractures.  A 
length  of  600  feet  was  badly  damaged  and  appeared 
no  longer  serviceable.  At  all  other  locations,  the  exist- 
ing pipe  could  be  salvaged  by  epoxy  injection  and  spot 
patching. 


CHAPTER    28 

Damage  to  Highway  Bridge  Structures' 

by  J.  Penzien^  and  R.  W.  Clough^ 


INTRODUCTION 

This  paper  is  based  on  a  report  entitled  "Observa- 
tions of  the  Damages  of  Highway  Bridge  Structures, 
San  Fernando,  California,  Earthquake  of  February  9, 
1971",  prepared  by  the  authors  in  April  1971,  at  the 
request  of  the  Office  of  Research,  Structures,  and  Ap- 
plied Mechanics  Division,  Federal  Highway  Admin- 
istration, Washington,  D.C.,  for  submission  to  the  Di- 
vision Structural  Engineer,  Federal  Highway  Admin- 
istration, Sacramento,  California. 

As  the  field  investigation  was  carried  out  on  12  and 
n  February  1971,  3  and  4  days  following  the  earth- 
quake, clearance  and  demolition  had  considerably 
changed  damage  patterns.  For  this  reason,  this  report 
is  not  a  complete  documentation  of  the  damage  ob- 
servable immediately  following  the  earthquake. 

The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  give  a  general  over- 
view of  the  damage  to  bridge  structures  caused  by  the 
earthquake  and  to  evaluate  some  of  the  damage  as  it 
relates  to  design  considerations. 

INTENSITIES  OF  GROUND  MOTION 
Although  the  earthquake  was  of  moderate  magni- 
tude, accelerograph  measurements  and  the  observed 
damage  to  structures  indicate  that  intensity  in  the 
immediate  vicinity  of  the  epicentral  area  was  probably 
near  the  upper-bound  level  for  earthquakes;  i.e.  peak 
accelerations  of  the  order  of  0.6  g. 

Since  intensity  decreased  rapidly  with  distance  from 
the  epicenter,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  intensities  at 
the  locations  of  the  damaged  highway  structures;  such 
assessment  will  most  likely  be  made  as  soon  as  all  re- 
corded strong  motion  accelerograms  have  been  proc- 
essed and  analyzed.

rangement of  bridges  and  overcrossings  at  the  inter- 
change of  Golden  State  Freeway  and  Foothill  Free-

collapsed  overcrossing  [3]*  which  carried  northbound 
traffic  from  the  Golden  State  Freeway  onto  Foothill 
Freeway.  Photo  1  shows  this  overcrossing  and  the 
adjacent  box  girder  span. 


Photo   1.     Overcrossing  at  the  Golden  State  Freeway  and  Foothill  Free- 
way interchange  [3]. 

Two  possible  causes  of  collapse  of  this  overcrossing 
were  (1)  the  large  vibratory  motion  induced  in  the 
super-structure  bv  the  high-intensity  vertical  and  hori- 
zontal ground  acceleration  and  (2)  the  relative  ground 
displacement  between  abutment  and  column  supports. 
Unfortunately,  it  was  very  difficult  to  assess  the  rela- 
tive importance  of  these  two  causes. 

In  the  background  of  photo  2  is  the  damaged  San 
Fernando  Road  overhead  [21  which  is  located  at  the 
intersection  of  the  Golden  State  Freeway  and  the 
Southern  Pacific  Railroad.  The  central  section  of  this 
bridge  (original  freeway)  was  built  with  steel  girders 
and  a  reinforced  concrete  deck  while  the  v.vo  outside 
sections  (widened  freeway)  were  built  entirely  of  re-- 
inforced  concrete.  During  the  earthquake,  the  central 
section  fell  off  one  of  its  supports  and  was  damaged. 
The  outside  precast  prestressed  concrete  sections  re- 
mained in  position  but  had  to  be  removed  after  the 
earthquake  to  provide  access  along  the  railroad. 

Photo  3  presents  a  close-up  view  of  this  bridge  at 
the  same  location  where  the  simple  span  crossing  the 
railroad  (front  foreground)  had  been  removed.  In  the 
background  of  this  photo,  one  can  see  the  precast  pre-

stressed  concrete  structures  to  the  north  along  the 
Golden  State  Freeway.  It  is  significant  to  note  the 
verv  narrow  ledges  which  provided  bearing-support 
surfaces  for  the  simple  span.  The  advisability  of  using 
such  narrow  support  surfaces  in  seismic  areas  should 
be  seriously  questioned. 

A  close-up  view  of  the  reinforced  concrete  bridge 
system  to  the  left  (south)  of  the  railroad  is  shown 
again  in  photo  4.  Here,  many  of  the  stiflFer  columns 
failed  b&gt;-  shearing  as  shown  in  photo  5,  while  the 
more  flexible  columns  sustained  flexural  damage  at 
their  tops  as  shown  in  photo  6. 

Photo  7  shows  a  close-up  view  of  similar  flexural 
damage  in  another  nearb\-  column  in  the  same  struc- 
ture. In  the  column  shown  in  photos  5  to  7,  the  main 
reinforcing  bars  on  both  sides  have  been  buckled  by 
the  flexural  compressive  forces.  Once  the  concrete 
cover  spalls  off  the  bars,  the  ties  are  inadequate  to 
provide  the  needed  lateral  constraint  to  the  main  re- 
inforcing bars  and  to  provide  containment  for  the 


concrete.  Such  damage  reduces  the  flexural  energy- 
absorption  capacity  of  these  columns. 

An  inspection  of  the  bearing  and  rocker  supports  of 
this  same  bridge  reveals  that  there  was  large  relative 
displacement  of  the  box  girders  and  their  abutment 
supports.  For  example,  photo  8  shows  how  one  end  of 
a  box  girder  deck  moved  to  the  left  on  its  bearing 
support  approximately  1  foot  \\\th  respect  to  the 
abutment. 

If  one  observed  these  same  bridge  structures  from 
the  top  rather  than  the  bottom,  he  could  easily  see 
the  large  settlment  caused  by  vibration-induced  com- 
paction of  the  soil  fills  leading  up  to  the  bridge  abut- 
ments. Photo  9  shows  the  large  vertical  offset  of  one 
of  the  south  abutments. 

The  highest  overcrossing  at  the  Golden  State  Free- 
way and  Foothill  Freeway  interchange,  which  was 
designed  to  carry  south-bound  traffic  entering  the 
Golden  State  Freeway  from  Foothill  Freeway,  was 
damaged  in  this  manner:

Starring  at  the  south  abutment  of  this  overcrossing, 
as  shown  in  photo  10,  the  first  span  of  the  box  girder 
deck  fell  on  to  the  side  slope.  Shown  in  the  foreground 
of  this  same  figure  is  the  San  Fernando  Road  overhead 
with  its  missing  span  along  the  Southern  Pacific  Rail- 
road.

Foothill  Freeway  interchange  [4]. 

The  box  girder  deck  of  this  770-foot-long  over- 
crossing  was  supported  on  six  central  piers  in  addition 
to  the  end  abutments.  The  two  central  piers  at  the 
south  end  of  the  overcrossing  were  supported  on 
spread  footings  which  were  in  turn  supported  on 
driven  concrete  piles.  Each  of  the  four  central  piers 
located  at  the  north  end  of  the  overcrossing  were  sup- 
ported directly  on  a  single  round  pile  cast  directly  in  a 
6-foot-diameter  drilled  hole.  The  box  girder  deck  had 
one  expansion  joint  near  mid-crossing  in  addition  to 
those  at  the  abutments. 

Farther  north  along  this  same  overcrossing,  one 
could  observe  sections  of  the  collapsed  structure  in 
their  fallen  positions  as  shown  in  photo  11.  Note  that 
this  portion  of  the  overcrossing  fell  in  a  westerly 
direction.

Considering  the  location  and  orientation  of  abut- 
ments and  the  expansion  joint  and  the  general  curvature 
of  the  deck  as  seen  in  a  plan  view,  it  is  quite  apparent 
that  the  deck  w  as  highly  constrained  against  large  dis- 
placement in  all  directions  except  the  west.  Therefore, 


it  is  easily  understood  why  the  structure  collapsed  in 
a  westerly  direction. 

Photo  12  shows  the  last  deck  span  where  it  crashed 
through  an  overcrossing  [51  of  the  Golden  State  Frce- 
u  a\'  which  directs  traffic  coming  from  the  north  along 
the  Golden  State  Freeway  onto  Foothill  Freeway 
going  east. 

A  close  look  at  the  columns  of  this  overcrossing 
indicates  that  they  generalK-  failed  at  the  bottom  be- 
cause of  the  superposition  of  high-flexure  forces  onto 
the  axial  forces.  The  column  shown  in  photo  13  also 
experienced  flexural  cracking  at  intermediate  points 
where  it  crashed  through  the  San  Fernando  Road  over- 
crossing.  Such  cracks  would  be  expected  under  such 
severe  impact. 

Of  much  greater  significance,  however,  are  the 
characteristics  of  failure  which  were  observed  at  the 
bases  of  these  columns.  Photo  14  shows  failure  charac- 
teristics typical  of  the  columns  supported  on  the  6- 
foot-diameter  cast-in-drilled-hole  piles.  It  is  quite  ap- 
parent that  the  anchorage  of  the  main  reinforcing  bars 
(no.  18  bars)  where  they  extended  into  the  supporting 
pile  was  inadequate.  Bond  failure  along  the  main  re- 
inforcing bars  was  quite  evident  at  these  locations.

State    Freeway   and 


Photo  1 5  shows  the  base  of  one  of  the  two  columns 
that  were  supported  on  spread  footings.  The  main  re- 
inforcing bars  entered  the  footing  and  were  bent  out- 
ward  to  provide  added  anchorage.  It  is  quite  apparent 
tliat  the  relatively  small  ties  (no.  4  bars)  could  not 
possibly  have  provided  the  required  containment  of 
main  reinforcing  bars  and  the  enclosed  concrete.  Lat- 
eral forces  developed  in  the  main  reinforcing  bars 
caused  spalling  of  the  concrete  cover,  thus  causing 
complete  loss  of  bond  with  the  concrete. 

of  the  two  possible  causes  of  collapse,  the  large 
vibratory  motion  induced  in  the  super-structure  by 
the  high  intensity  vertical  and  horizontal  ground  ac- 
celeration and  the  ground  displacement  between  abut- 
ment and  column  supports,  the  authors  think  that  the 
vibrator\-  motion  was  the  major  cause  of  the  collapse 
of  this  structure. 

Motion  and  displacement  can,  of  course,  combine 
to  produce  movement  at  abutments  and  expansion 
joints.  In  this  case,  the  relative  displacement  was  cer-

and  State  Highway  14  interchange  is  shown  in  the 
upper  left  of  the  map  (figure  1 ). 

Several  of  the  ovcrcrossings  in  this  interchange 
were  still  under  construction  at  the  time  of  tlic  earth- 
quake, as  seen  in  photo  16.  In  the  foreground  of  this 
northerly  view,  one  can  see  a  row  of  newly  con- 
structed columns  for  an  overcrossing.  Immediately

photo  19,  which  gives  a  view  of  the  central  column 
from  its  top  toward  bottom. 


Photo   16.     Collapsed  overcrossing  at  the  Golden  State  Freeway  and 
State  Highway  14  interchange  [7]. 


Behind  the  second  overcrossing,  the  highest  over- 
crossing  [7]  in  the  interchange  can  he  seen,  terminat- 
ing at  one  of  its  expansion  joints.  From  this  point  on 
to  the  right  (cast),  a  ^54-foot-long  section  of  the  over- 
crossing  collapsed  during  the  earthquake.  This  long, 
prestrcssed-concretc  section  of  bridge  deck  was  sup- 
ported at  each  end  on  bearing  supports  at  expansion 
)oints  and  b\-  a  single  central  column  standing  ap- 
proximatcl\-  160  feet  high.  This  column  can  be  seen 
lying  in  its  fallen  position  nn  tiic  side  hill  directly  be- 
hind the  steel  formwork  shown  in  photo  16. 

The  initial  cause  of  collapse  of  this  structure  appears 
to  ha\e  been  the  large  relative  deck  displacement  of 
the  west  expansion  joint  w  hich  allowed  the  box  girder 
to  fall  off  its  bearing  supports.  The  falling  cantilevered 
portion  of  the  deck  span  pulled  the  deck  system  to 
the  west,  permitting  the  east  end  of  the  span  also  to 
fall  off  its  supports.  Roth  cantilevered  portions  of  the 
deck  span  broke  off  at  the  top  of  the  central  column 
allowing  them  to  fall  almost  dircctl\-  down  from  their 
original  positions.  The  central  column  fell  to  the  west, 
(photo  17),  landing  nearl\-  on  top  of  the  west  portion 
of  the  deck  span.  The  top  of  the  central  column 
landed  directly  on  a  new  truck  crane,  which  was 
totally  destroyed  (photo  18). 

The  eastern  portion  of  the  deck  slid  down  the 
central  column  as  indicated  bv  the  dark  abrasive  mark-

way. The  location  of  the  Foothill  Boulevard  under- 
crossing  at  its  intersection  with  the  Foothill  Freeway 
can  be  seen  in  figure  1  [9].  Two  similar  reinforced- 
concrete,  box-girder  bridges  carry  the  Foothill  Free- 
way traffic  over  Footliill  Boulevard  at  this  point.  These 
two  parallel  bridges  are  shown  from  below  in  photo 
22,  as  vie\\'ed  from  Foothill  Boulevard  toward  the  west. 

The  central-span  columns  of  the  east  bridge  sus- 
tained heavy  shear  damage,  followed  by  vertical  crush- 
ing of  the  broken  concrete  causing  the  main  reinforc- 
ing bars  to  buckle  outwards.  Clearly,  the  ties  (no.  4 
bars)  provided  were  inadequate  to  contain  the  con- 
crete and  provide  stabilit\'  for  the  main  reinforcing 
steel.  The  progressively  heavier  damage  observed  from 
the  innermost  column  towards  the  outermost  column 
\\ould  suggest  that  significant  torsional  displacement 
was  produced  b&gt;'  the  earthquake.

The  Roxford  Street  bridge  [35]  was  a  simple-span, 
prestressed-concrete  bridge.  No  damage  to  the  deck 
and   abutments   was   observed   at  this   undercrossing.

However,  one  wing-wall  had  been  totally  broken  away 
from  its  abutment,  as  shown  in  photo  23.  and  recent 
excavations  have  revealed  heavy  damage  to  the  piles 
supporting  the  abutments.  Dainage  such  as  this  indi- 
cates that  very  high  pressure  was  applied  to  the  abut- 
ments during  the  earthquake. 

Ground  vibration  at  this  overcrossing  caused  com- 
paction of  all  fill  placed  around  the  abutments,  pro- 
ducing further  damage  due  to  differential  settlement. 
Photo  24  shows  the  amount  of  differential  settlement 
next  to  the  abutments  at  one  end  of  this  bridge.  The 
tire  skid  marks  on  the  pavement  are  a  vivid  reminder 
of  the  hazard  to  moving  vehicles  caused  by  such 
settlement. 

Polk  Street  Undercrossing  at  Foothill  Freeway. 
The  damage  observed  at  the  Polk  Street  undercrossing 
f.^8l  at  Foothill  Freeway  was  similar  to  that  at  the 
Roxford  Street  undercrossing;  i.e.,  damage  caused  by 
backfill  settlement  near  the  abutments  and  damage  to 
the  wing- wall.  Large  compressive  ground  deforma- 
tion caused  the  asphalt  pavement  to  buckle  upwards 
in  one  location  near  this  undercrossing,  as  shown  in 
photo  25.

showed  no  structural  damage,  settlement  of  the  fill 
caused  differential  vertical  displacement  at  the  abut- 
ments. Near  this  bridge,  excessive  compressive  ground 
deformation  caused  upward  buckling  of  the  asphalt 
pavement  similar  to  that  in  photo  25. 

Bledsol  Street  Undercrossing  at  Foothill  Freeivay. 
Resides  settlement  of  fill,  longitudinal  oscillation  of  the 
bridge  at  the  Bledsol  Street  undercrossing  [36]  ap- 
parently was  strong  enough  to  force  crushed  rock  out 
of  a  weep  hole,  as  shown  in  photo  26.  There  was  no 
evidence  that  water  had  forced  the  rock  out  of  the 
hole  or  out  of  other  holes  where  the  same  thing  oc- 
curred. 

Tyler  Street  Pedestrian  Overcrossing  at  Foothill 
Freeivay.  The  Tyler  Street  pedestrian  overcrossing 
[37]  at  Foothill  Freeway  was  fairly  heavily  damaged, 
mainly  along  its  longitudinal  axis,  because  of  vibra- 
tion. The  amount  of  permanent  longitudinal  displace- 
ment could  be  most  readily  .seen  at  the  north  support 
as  show  n  in  photo  27.  This  deformation  caused  serious 
fiexural  damage  at  the  tops  of  the  columns.  Although 
onl\-  minor  damage  could  be  observed  at  the  bases 
of  these  columns  (photo  28),  considerable  fiexural 
damage  should  be  expected  at  the  level  of  the  footings.

This  simple-span  bridge  [20]  has  a  bearing  support  at 
one  abutment  and  a  pinned  support  at  the  other.  The 
longitudinal  forces  developed  in  the  bridge  deck  dur- 
ing the  earthquake  were  sufficient  to  cause  severe  flex- 
ure-cracking in  the  diaphragm  abutment  at  the  pinned 
end. 

SaJita  Clara  Overhead  Crossing  on  State  Highway 
14.  Considerable  pounding  damage  along  the  expan- 
sion joints  of  the  Santa  Clara  overhead  crossing  on 
State  High\va\'  14  was  observed,  (photo  29),  as  well  as 
a  buckled  flexible  splice  (photo  30)  in  a  steel  conduit 
to  be  placed  within  the  concrete  bridge  curbing  which 
had  not  yet  been  poured. 

Shear  damage  and  design  specifications.  The  maxi- 
mum base  shears,  occurring  in  linear  elastic  structures 
responding  as  single-degree-of-freedom  systems  to 
horizontal  ground  motions,  can  be  evaluated  using  re- 
sponse spectrum  curves.  For  example,  extrapolating  G. 
Housner's  design-response  spectrum  curves  (1970, 
p.  94)  to  a  period  of  vibration  T  equal  to  4.9  seconds 
and  using  a  damping  coefficient  of  5  percent  of  critical, 
one  obtains  a  base  shear  coefficient  approximately  equal 
to  0.085  g  for  the  El  Centro,  California,  earthquake 
of  1940.  A  period  of  4.9  seconds  is  assumed  in  this 
example,  as  it  corresponds  to  the  transverse  period  of 
vibration  given  by  the  code  formula  T  =  0.32  V  D/P  , 
where  D  =  dead  load  reaction  of  structural  and  P  = 
force  required  for  1  inch  horizontal  deflection  of 
structure  (California  Division  of  Highways,  1968,  pp. 
2-24)  for  the  high  overcrossing  which  collapsed  at 
the  Golden  State  Freeway-State  Highway  14  inter- 
change [7]. 

It  is  extremely  significant  that  this  base  shear  coeffi- 
cient (0.085  g)  is  much  greater  than  the  design  base 
shear  coefficient  (C)  of  0.030  g  given  by  the  empirical 
code  formula  C  =  0.05/^^  T  .  This  simple  com- 
parison alone  indicates  that  the  present  code  seismic 
forces  are  too  low  for  design  purposes.

CONCLUSIONS  AND  RECOMMENDATIONS 

Ground  Motion 

While  it  is  difficult  to  assess  quantitatively  the  in- 
tensities at  the  location  of  the  damaged  highway 
structures,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  similar  in- 
tensities will  occur  during  future  earthquakes  of  mod- 
erate to  large  magnitude.  Full  consideration  should, 
therefore,  be  given  to  this  possibilit\-  in  the  design  of 
all  highway  structures  located  in  seismically  active 
regions. 

Seismic  Forces 

The  use  of  the  formula  C  =  0.05/-^rT~  in  the 
design  of  high\\a\-  bridge  structures  should  be  seriously 
questioned  and  reconsidered  for  several  reasons: 

(1)  It  was  originally  developed  for  use  in  the  design 
of  buildings,  which  are  not  equivalent  to  bridges 
in  their  earthquake  behavior.  Specifically,  it  is 
known  that  nonstructural  components,  such  as  in- 
terior walls  and  exterior  cladding,  contribute 
significantly  to  the  earthquake  response  of  build- 
ings. 

(2)  The  seismic  coefficient  prescribed  for  the  design 
of  buildings  does  not  represent  the  full  force  ex- 
pected by  a  major  earthquake;  it  is  expected  that 
inelastic  deformation  will  result  from  a  major 
earthquake,  and  the  designer  is  expected  to  insure 
adequate  ductile  deformability  of  the  structure. 

(3)  The  formula  for  evaluation  of  the  period  of  vi- 
bration of  the  structure  is  grossly  oversimplified. 
It  must  be  recognized  in  evaluating  the  vibration 
period  that  the  bridge  deck  will  be  subject,  in 
many  cases,  to  lateral  flexure  during  earthquakes. 

Causes  of  Collapse 

Two  possible  causes  of  collapse  of  the  high  over- 
crossings  [3,  4,  71  are:  (1)  large  vibratory  motion  in- 
duced in  super-structures  by  high-intensity  vertical 
and  horizontal  ground  acceleration  and  (2)  relative 
ground  displacement  between  the  abutment  and  col- 
umn supports.  It  is  the  opinion  of  the  authors  that 
vibratory  motion  was  the  major  cause  of  the  collapse 
of  these  structures.  We  found  no  evidence  that  relative 
displacement  was  a  contributing  factor. 

Design  Considerations 

1.  Expansion  Joints — Collapse  of  the  high  over- 
crossings  was  initiated  b\'  bridge  spans  falling  off  their 
supports  at  abutments  and  expansion  joints  due  to  ex- 
cessive displacement  of  the  spans  relatixe  to  their  sup- 
ports. This  t\'pc  of  behavior  should  he  carefully  ex- 
amined and  corrective  measures  should  be  taken  as 
soon  as  possible.  Full  consideration  should  be  given 
to  eliminating  expansion  joints  wherever  feasible,  to 
widening  bearing  supports,  and  to  providing  more  ef- 
fective ties  across  expansion  joints. 


2.  Columns — ^Failure  in  the  central  portion  of  the 
shorter  stiff  columns  was  caused  by  transverse  shear 
forces,  while  end  failure  in  the  larger,  more  flexible 
columns  was  caused  by  flexura!  forces.  In  each  case, 
there  was  a  noticeable  lack  of  transverse  ties.  Clearly, 
the  design  details  of  columns  should  be  carefully 
examined,  particularly  with  regard  to  size  and  place- 
ment of  reinforcing  bars  and  ties,  and  corrective 
measures  should  be  taken  to  improve  their  performance 
under  ultimate  loading  conditions  involving  reverse 
deformation  cycles  such  as  occur  during  major  earth- 
quakes. 

3.  Column  Caps — There  appears  to  be  a  serious 
lack  of  reinforcing  bars  tying  column  caps  onto  their 
respective  box  girder  bridge  decks.  Corrective  measures 
should  be  taken  to  improve  this  design  detail. 

4.  Column  Foundations — Failure  at  the  base  of  col- 
umns for  both  types  of  support;  i.e.,  single  cast-in- 
place  pile  and  spread  footings  with  driven  piles 
showed  inadequate  anchorage  of  tlie  main  reinforcing 
bars.  Corrective  measures  should  be  taken  so  that 
sufficient  anchorage  is  provided  to  develop  the  full 
strength  of  the  main  reinforcing  bars. 

5.  Abutments  and  Wing  Walls — Failure  in  abut- 
ments and  wing  walls  were  caused  by  large  dynamic 
forces  transmitted  by  backfill  earth  pressure  and  by 
seismic  forces  developed  in  the  bridge  decks.  The 
design  details  of  these  structures  should  be  re-examined 
and  appropriate  corrective  measures  should  be  taken 
to  improve  their  performance  characteristics. 

Design  Philosophy 

The  present  elastic  design  philosophy  using  equiva- 
lent static  loading  to  represent  seismic  effects  should 
be  reviewed  and  appropriate  code  changes  should  be 
made  to  improve:  (1)  response  to  the  dynamic  char- 
acter and  intensity  of  seismic  loading;  (2)  structural 
characteristics  under  ultimate  loading  conditions,  par- 
ticularly strength  and  ductility;  and  (3)  behavior  when 
deformed  beyond  the  elastic  limit. 

Needed  Research 

The  damage  to  bridge  structures  during  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake  point  up  the  urgent  need  for 
both  theoretical  and  experimental  research  related  di- 
rectl&gt;-  to  seismic  effects  on  bridge  structures. 

It  is  recommended  that  theoretical  studies,  consisting 
mainly  of  dynamic  analyses  of  several  of  the  high 
overcrossings  which  failed,  be  initiated  as  soon  as  pos- 
sible and  that  experimental  investigations  be  under- 
taken as  soon  as  meaningful  programs  can  be  defined. 
These  experimental  studies  should  include  investiga- 
tions of  bond  and  confinement  in  typical  large-size  pier 
sections,  as  well  as  of  the  dynamic  behavior  of  typical 
bridge  systems. 


CHAPTER   29 

Effects  of  the  San  Fernando  Earthiquake 

on  tfie 
Van  Norman  Reservoir  Complex  ' 


by  Clifford  J.  Cortright  ' 


The  purpose  of  this  report  is  twofold:  (1)  to 
document  in  preliminary  form  the  effects  of  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971,  on  the  Van 
Norman  Reservoir  Complex,  particularly  on  the 
Upper  and  Lower  San  Fernando  Dams  which  were 
severely  affected;  and  (2)  to  indicate  the  nature  of 
the  investigations  being  conducted,  together  with  a 
preliminary  analysis  of  the  mechanics  of  the  slide 
which  took  place  at  Lower  San  Fernando  Dam. 

Immediately  following  the  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake of  February  9,  1971,  an  investigation  of  the 
effects  of  the  earthquake  on  the  Van  Norman  Reser- 
voir Complex  was  initiated  by  the  State  Division  of 
Safety  of  Dams.  Such  an  investigation  of  Lower  San 
Fernando  Dam  is  extremely  important,  whether  or 
not  the  dam  is  reconstructed.  This  dam  is  one  of  the 
more  than  30  hydraulic  fill  dams  within  jurisdiction 
of  the  State  with  respect  to  safety.  There  is  an  urgent 
need  to  know  what  happened,  why  it  happened,  and 
what  needs  to  be  done  to  assure  that  under  comparable 
circumstances  it  would  not  happen  to  any  other  of 
these  dams. 

As  someone  has  said,  with  undisguised  naivete, 
each  earthquake  is  a  surprise.  We  in  California  have 
long  since  learned  to  expect  earthquakes  from  time  to 
time — we  k?iow  we  are  going  to  have  them — and  for 
years  we  have  designed  structures  to  be  earthquake- 
resistant.  Yet,  when  we  have  a  quake,  we  are  sur- 
prised— surprised  by  its  location,  by  its  timing,  by  its 
effect  on  people,  by  its  effect  on  structures.  Certainly, 
there  is  nothing  more  unsettling,  more  fear-evoking, 
than  a  rupturing  and  strong  shaking  of  the  earth. 

The  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9, 
1971,  was  no  less  a  surprise  than  its  major  predecessors. 
For  one  thing,  its  location  was  completely  unexpected. 
For  another,  that  the  movement  occurred  along  a 
thrust  fault  is  in  itself  unusual.  Then,  too,  although 


^  Manuscript  submitted  for  publication  October  5,  1971.  The  field 
investigation  was  conducted  and  the  report  on  the  history 
and  effects  of  the  earthqualce  was  prepared  by  Roger  E. 
Stephenson,  Alberico  A.  Coluzzi,  and  Warren  D.  Pedersen 
of  the  State  Division  of  Safety  of  Dams.  The  section  on  the 
Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  slide  has  been  abridged  from  a 
preliminary  report  prepared  by  H.  Bolton  Seed,  K.  L.  Lee, 
and  I.  M.  Idriss  of  the  Department  of  Civil  Engineering  of 
the  University  of  California,  Berkeley.

partment of  Water  Resources. 


registering  a  magnitude  of  only  6'/2  on  the  Richter 
scale,  it  developed  the  largest  ground  accelerations 
ever  recorded.  And,  for  an  earthquake  of  such  rela- 
tively moderate  magnitude,  its  effect  on  structures 
was  phenomenal,  despite  an  extremely  short  duration 
of  strong  shaking  of  only  12  or  13  seconds. 

Damage  resulted  from  fractures,  lurching,  shak- 
ing, and  differential  movement.  Actual  ruptures  of  the 
earth,  of  streets,  of  utilities,  of  buildings,  were  com- 
mon along  the  fault  trace  in  San  Fernando  and  Syl- 
mar  and  elsewhere  (see  figure  1).  A  major  water  sup- 
ply tunnel,  under  construction,  had  differential  vertical 
movement  exceeding  6  feet.  Damage  from  shaking 
predominated,  however,  to  hospitals,  schools,  and 
other  major  buildings;  to  highway  interchanges;  to 
power  switchyards  and  water  treatment  facilities;  and 
to  the  two  major  dams  of  the  Van  Norman  Reservoir 
Complex — Upper  and  Lower  San  Fernando  Dams. 

This  report  has  to  do  primarily  vAth  these  two 
dams.  Why  did  they  respond  as  they  did?  What  were 
the  earthquake  forces  involved?  Why  was  the  re- 
cently constructed  rolled  fill  embankment  of  the 
Lower  Van  Norman  Bypass  Dam  apparently  unaf- 
fected by  the  earthquake,  with  so  much  damage  else- 
where in  the  vicinity?  These  are  questions  which  need 
to  be  resolved,  and  this  interim  report  will  set  the 
stage  toward  such  resolution.  These  questions  are 
pertinent,  not  only  to  the  Van  Norman  Reser\'oir 
Complex  and  to  repair  or  reconstruction  of  the  dams 
involved,  but  to  all  embankment  dams  which  have 
similar  characteristics. 

Both  Upper  and  Lower  San  Fernando  Dams  are 
hydraulic  fills.  There  are  30  other  hydraulic  fill  dams 
within  jurisdiction  of  the  State  for  safet&gt;^  Will  these 
dams  react  similarly  if  subjected  to  a  similar  earth- 
quake? Or  how  about  an  even  larger  earthquake,  a 
great  earthquake  like  San  Francisco  in  1906  or  Fort 
Tejon  in  1857?  Are  all  hydraulic  fill  dams  suspect? 
Many  dams  throughout  the  United  States  are  hydraulic 
fills,  and  some  are  very  large.  For  example,  the  Fort 
Peck  Dam  on  the  Missouri  River  in  Montana  is  to  date 
the  largest  earthfill  ever  constructed  in  the  western 
hemisphere;  it,  too,  is  a  hydraulic  fill.  The  Kingsley 
Dam  on  the  North  Platte  River  in  Nebraska  is  a  very 
large  hydraulic  fill.  The  Miami  Conser\'ancy  District 
in  Ohio  built  several  such  dams  before  1920.  Cobble 
Mountain  Dam  and  Quabbin  Dike  in  Massachusetts  are

hydraulic  fill  dams.  Several  of  these  dams  are  in  the 
range  of  1.50  to  250  feet  in  height.  With  the  advent  of 
the  wheel  scraper  and  an  effective  tamping  roller  in 
the  early  1930,s,  and  later  the  high  speed,  large-capacity 
loading  and  hauling  equipment  and  even  better  rollers, 
h\'draulic  fill  dams  have  become  economically  obsolete 
in  the  United  States.  However,  between  about  1910 
and  1941,  the  h\draulic  fill  was  a  most  popular  method 
of  constructing  earth  dams  because  of  its  economy  in 
terms  of  construction  methods  then  available.  There- 
fore, the  investigations  conducted  at  the  Van  Norman 
Reservoir  Complex  are  of  significant  importance  to 
the  entire  dam-building  profession,  not  only  here  in 
California,  but  throughout  the  United  States  and 
possibly  the  world. 

HISTORY  AND  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE 
VAN  NORMAN   RESERVOIR  COMPLEX 

Los  Angeles  Aqueduct 

Los  Angeles,  established  by  the  Spanish  Crown 
in  1781,  had  grown  to  a  city  of  a  half  million  by  1913. 
By  this  date  the  local  water  resources  had  been  well 
developed;  and,  in  order  to  ensure  an  adequate  water 
supply  and  to  prepare  for  the  potential  growth  of  the 
area,  an  additional  source  of  water  was  required.  The 
search  for  a  dependable  water  supply  was  started  in 
early  1900;  and,  after  the  consideration  of  various 
alternatives,  the  decision  was  made  to  bring  water 
from  the  Owens  River  by  what  was  to  be  known  as 
the  Los  Angeles  Aqueduct.  The  work  on  the  first 
phase  of  the  aqueduct  was  started  in  late  1907  and 
completed  in  1913  at  a  cost  of  $23  million.  This  phase 
began  with  the  hcadworks  diverting  the  Owens  River 
into  the  aqueduct  near  the  town  of  Aberdeen,  30 
miles  south  of  Bishop,  in  Owens  Valley,  Inyo  County. 


By  a  series  of  canals,  tunnels,  siphons,  and  reser- 
voirs, water  was  conveyed  southward  along  the  east 
side  of  the  Sierra  Nevada,  across  the  Alojave  Desert 
(Antelope  Valley),  and  initially  into  San  Fernando 
No.  2  Reservoir,  now  known  as  Lower  Van  Norman 
Reservoir,  and  later,  in  1922,  into  San  Fernando  No.  1 
Reservoir,  now  kno\\n  as  Upper  \''an  Norman  Reser- 
voir. The  original  design  of  the  aqueduct  provided  for 
a  mean  annual  flow  of  400  cubic  feet  per  second  of 
water  at  the  terminus.  However,  historically  the  aver- 
age annual  flow  has  been  on  the  order  of  440  cfs,  or 
a  total  annual  quantit\'  of  about  320,000  acre-fcct.  In 
1932,  Tinemaha  Reservoir  was  constructed  on  the 
Owens  River  near  Independence,  and  in  1940  the 
water  tributary  to  the  Mono  Basin  was  brought  into 
the  system  with  the  completion  of  the  Mono  Craters 
Tunnel  and  Crowley  Lake. 

In  1970  the  second  Los  Angeles  Aqueduct  was 
completed,  and  an  additional  flow  of  approximately 
285  cfs  was  routed  into  the  Van  Norman  Reservoir 
Complex.  The  capacit&gt;'  of  this  second  aqueduct  from 
the  Bouquet  Reservoir  pipeline  to  the  Van  Norman 
Reservoirs  is  approximately  350  cfs,  thus  allowing 
Bouquet  Reservoir  to  be  used  as  both  a  storage  and 
a  regulating  reservoir. 

The  importance  of  the  Los  Angeles  Aqueducts 
is  readil\'  apparent  when  it  is  noted  that,  prior  to  the 
Februar\-  9  earthquake,  it  was  estimated  that  these 
supply  lines  would  carry  about  80  percent  of  the 
City's  suppl\"  in  the  \ear  1970-71. 

Lower  San  Fernando  Dam 

In  order  to  provide  for  terminal  storage  at  a  loca- 
tion close  to  the  cir\'  and  at  an  elevation  that  would 
provide  for  efficient  delivery  of  water  to  the  distribu- 
tion system,  the  construction  of  Lower  San  Fernando

Dam  (Lower  \'an  Norman  Reservoir)  was  started  in 
1912.  Although  at  that  time  the  economy  of  the  site 
was  questioned  because  of  the  large-size  dam  re- 
quired for  the  amount  of  storage  to  be  gained,  it  was 
finall\-  given  favorable  consideration  because  of  the 
suitability  of  construction  material  close  to  the  dam 
for  hydraulic  fill  construction. 

Between  1912  and  1915,  the  embankment  was  con- 
structed to  about  Elevation  1080  at  the  axis  and  1090 
at  the  upstrcani  and  dow  nstream  edges  (streambed  at 
axis  was  approximately  at  Elevation  995)  using  mate- 
rial hydraulicked  from  the  floor  of  the  reservoir. 

The  dam  is  founded  on  a  dense  clay  alluvium 
with  lenses  of  sand  overlying  an  impervious  complex 
of  shales  and  sandstones  to  a  reported  depth  of  about 
35  feet.  There  are  reported  to  be  three  cutoff  trenches 
through  this  alluvium  which  are  backfilled  with  hy- 
draulicked material. 

The  dam  was  essentially  a  hydraulic  fill  embank- 
ment capped  by  a  potpourri  of  wagon-dumped  and 
rolled  fill  founded  on  alluvium  with  three  cutoff 
trenches  to  bedrock;  it  had  an  upstream  slope  of 
2/2 :1;  downstream  slopes  of  2!;:1  and  4^1:1;  with  a 
20-foot  berm  at  Elevation  1096,  a  height  of  142  feet, 
crest  width  of  20  feet,  and  a  length  of  2180  feet.  It 
\\as  faced  upstream  with  lightly  reinforced  concrete 
and  had  a  3-foot-high  concrete  parapet  wall  at  the 
upstream  edge  of  the  crest.  Altogether,  about  3.3  mil- 
lion cubic  yards  of  embankment  were  used  in  con- 
struction to  impound  25,500  acre-feet  of  A\'ater. 

In  1967  on  the  recommendation  of  the  City's 
consultants,  concurred  in  by  the  State  Division  of 
Safety  of  Dams,  the  reservoir  w'as  being  operated  at 
a  maximum  water  surface  elevation  of  1125  or  9.65 
feet  below  the  spillway  crest  elevation.  This  additional 
freeboard  was  maintained  because  of  uncertainty  with 
respect  to  construction  methods,  the  history  of  the 
dam,  and  the  results  of  the  City's  slope-stability  anal- 


ysis performed  in  1967.  As  part  of  the  City's  long- 
range  facilit)'  improvement  program,  this  dam  was 
scheduled  to  be  strengthened  or  reconstructed  about 
1973  or  1974.  The  Lower  Van  Norman  Bypass  Reser- 
voir had  been  completed  and  placed  into  service  in 
July  1970  in  preparation  for  taking  the  Lower  Van 
Norman  Reservoir  out  of  service  for  alteration. 

Surveillance  of  the  Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  in- 
cluded measuring  horizontal  movement  and  settle- 
ment of  the  dam  through  monuments  located  initially 
on  the  parapet  wall  and  later  in  the  embankment  on 
the  dam  crest.  Observation  wells  ^\•ere  located  on  the 
upstream  and  downstream  slopes  of  the  dam  to  meas- 
ure the  phraetic  line  within  the  embankment  at  vari- 
ous locations.  Seepage  collected  by  drains  in  the 
foundation  of  the  dam  w  as  routineK"  measured  and  re- 
corded. A  Wilmot  seismoscope  and  a  Teled\Tie  peak- 
recording  accelcrograph  were  located  on  the  crest 
near  the  center  of  the  dam,  and  another  Wilmot 
seismoscope  was  located  on  the  east  (left)  abut- 
ment. Three  tiltmeters  were  located  at  the  crest,  on 
the  Elevation  1096  berm,  and  at  the  toe  of  the  dam. 
All  surveillance  data  were  reviewed  periodically  by 
the  Los  Angeles  Department  of  Water  and  Power  and 
the  State  Division  of  Safety-  of  Dams. 

Lower  San  Fernando  Dam,  Geology  and 
Foundation  Conditions 

The  dam  embankment  in  the  channel  section  and 
the  lowermost  portions  of  the  abutments  rest  on 
Holoccne  alluvium  which,  according  to  City  records, 
consists  of  dense  clay  with  lenses  of  sand  and  gravel. 
This  alluvium  attains  a  maximum  thickness  of  approxi- 
mately 35  feet  beneath  the  dam.  Three  earth-filled 
cutoff  trenches  constructed  prior  to  the  placement  of 
the  hydraulic  fill  intercept  this  alluvial  section  and 
extend  into  the  underlying  sedimentary  bedrock. 

Three  marine  sedimentary  formations  comprise

the  bedrock  that  forms  the  abutments  and  the  founda- 
non  beneath  the  alluvium  and  the  hydraulic  and  rolled 
fills.  These  formations  from  oldest  to  youngest  and 
from  east  to  west  are  the  Modelo  of  late  Aliocene 
age,  the  Repetto  of  early  Pliocene,  and  the  lower 
member  of  the  Pico  of  middle  Pliocene  age. 

The  Modelo  Formation  underlies  the  east,  al- 
ways called  the  left,  abutment.  It  extends  under  the 
dam  a  short  distance  toward  the  west,  dipping  about 
40  degrees  southwesterly  beneath  the  dam.  It  consists 
of  gray  to  brown,  thinly  stratified  diatomaceous  shale, 
siliceous  shale,  and  siltstone.  The  upper  30  to  50  feet 
of  the  Modelo  Formation  are  weathered  to  varying 
degrees  and  contain  numerous  gypsum-filled  seams 
along  joints,  fractures,  and  bedding  planes.  It  is  on 
this  weathered  and  fractured  phase  that  the  left  end 
of  the  dam  rests.  Dissolving  of  this  gypsum  by  reser- 
voir waters  through  the  years  is  believed  to  have  been 
a  cause  of  the  excessive  seepage  through  the  left  abut- 
ment which  existed  prior  to  extensive  grouting  of  the 
abutment  in  1964. 

The  next  younger  formation,  the  Repetto  For- 
mation, overlies  the  Modelo  Formation  and  likewise 
dips  \\esterly  toward  the  right  abutment.  It  consists 
of  clay,  siltstone,  and  diatomaceous  shale.  Its  subsur- 
face extent  as  measured  on  the  dam  axis  is  approxi- 
mately 800  feet  from  Station  3+00  to  Station  11-fOO. 
The  nature  of  the  contact  here  between  the  Modelo 


and  the  Repetto  Formations  is  not  known  with  any 
degree  of  certainty. 

The  lower  member  of  the  Pico  Formation  is  in 
normal  depositional  contact  with  the  underlying  Re- 
petto Formation  and  extends  westerly  from  about 
Station  11+00  to  beyond  the  end  of  the  dam  and 
forms  the  entire  right  abutment.  The  Pico  Formation 
here  at  the  dam  consists  largeK-  of  massive,  friable, 
coarse  gray-\\hite  sandstone  with  lesser  amounts  of 
finer-grained  sandstone.  The  Pico  Formation,  as  well 
as  the  underlying  Repetto  Formation,  dips  from  30  to 
50  degrees  northwesterly. 

The  most  significant  structural  feature  at  the 
dam  is  the  Alission  Hills  anticline,  the  north  limb  of 
which  forms  the  left  abutment.  The  anticline  plunges 
from  30  to  45  degrees  to  the  west.  The  highly  frac- 
tured nature  of  the  .Modelo  Formation  on  the  left 
abutment  may  in  part  be  attributable  to  the  folding  of 
the  beds  along  the  anticlinal  axis. 

Upper  San  Fernando  Dam 

The  Upper  San  Fernando  Dam,  a  semihydraulic 
and  dry-fill  embankment,  \\as  constructed  to  provide 
flexibility  of  operation  and  supplementary  storage  at 
the  terminus  of  the  Los  Angeles  Aqueduct.  The  semi- 
hydraulic  fill  portion  ^\•as  constructed  to  about  Eleva- 
tion 1200  in  1921  by  using  about  500,000  cubic  yards 
of  material  obtained  from  the  reservoir  area  of  the 
valley  floor.  Although  it  M'as  originally  planned  to  be

constructed  tn  Flevation  1238  in  1922,  the  dam  was 
instc;id  raised  tn  I'lc\ation  121S  In'  pincintj  some  50.000 
cubic  yards  of  compacted  dry  fill  on  the  upstream 
side.  The  dry-fill  material  was  obtained  from  side-hill 
borrow,  spread  in  thin  la\'crs,  sprinkled  and  wagon- 
rolled.  The  completed  section  of  the  dam  has  a  2.5:1 
concrete  paved  upstream  slope,  a  crest  20  feet  wide, 
and  a  downstream  slope  of  2.5:1  with  a  100-foot  berm 
at  Elevation  1200.  Originally,  the  reservoii-  capacit&gt;' 
was  1977  acre-feet,  but  the  storage  capacit&gt;"  was  re- 
duced to  1848  acre-feet  b\-  siltation  during  the  1938 
flood  and  later  by  the  construction  of  the  dikes  along 
the  western  side  of  the  reservoir.  These  dikes  provide 
flood-control  protection  and  divert  the  local  upstream 
runoff  and  debris  from  the  reservoir. 

The  method  of  construction  used  material  hauled 
by  wagons  from  the  borrow  area  to  the  edges  of  the 
embankment  where  it  was  dumped  then  dispersed  by 
monitors  working  from  barges  floating  in  the  center 
pool.  This  was  common  procedure  when  water  was  in 
short  supply  and  it  was  necessary  to  recycle  the  pool 
water.  The  rolled-fill  section  was  probably  placed  in 
similar  manner  to  otiiers  built  at  the  time.  It  was  com- 
mon procedure  to  haul  the  material  from  the  borrow, 
deposit  on  the  fill  and  spread  in  lifts  using  teams  and 
Fresno  scrapers  and,  after  sprinkling,  to  provide  com- 
paction by  routing  the  haul  w  agons  over  the  area. 

Available  cross  sections  of  the  dam  show  a  cutoff 
trench  extending  to  a  depth  of  4  feet  into  alluvium  for 


a  width  of  30  feet.  This  was  probably  intended  only  to 
cut  off  rodent  holes  and  vegetation.  Recent  exploration 
indicates  alluvium  has  a  depth  of  50  feet. 

.An  outlet  tower  stands  just  upstream  of  the  toe 
of  the  embankment  at  about  the  midpoint  of  the  dam. 
The  tower  is  founded  on  alluvium  at  about  Elevation 
1149  and  rises  about  90  feet  to  Elevation  1239.  It  is 
similar  to  the  towers  at  the  lower  reservoir  having  a 
constant  outside  diameter  of  20  feet  and  stepped  in- 
ternal diameters  of  about  16,  14,  12,  and  10  feet.  The 
tower  connects  to  an  8-foot-diametcr  concrete  cast- 
in-place  outlet  pipe.  This  pipe  has  a  62-inch  inside  di- 
ameter reinforced-concrete  steel  cylinder  pipe  with 
lead-filled  joints  inserted  through  it  with  the  annular 
space  between  the  two  filled  with  concrete  for  the  up- 
stream 160  feet. 

In  1968  a  second  outlet  was  constructed  by  con- 
crete encasement  of  a  99-inch  welded  steel  pipe 
through  the  right  abutment  at  an  inlet  elevation  of 
1185.  In  addition  to  these  outlets,  it  has  been  standard 
procedure  to  operate  the  reservoir  to  spill  water  into 
the  lower  reservoir  through  the  overflow  spillway  at 
the  left  of  the  dam.  A  bypass  of  the  upper  reservoir  is 
available  through  an  open  channel  \\  hich  skirts  the  east 
side  of  the  reservoir  and  connects  the  aqueduct  above 
the  reservoir  with  the  spillway  chute  going  into  Lower 
Van  Norman  Reservoir.  As  part  of  the  City's  over-all 
facility  improvement  program,  the  upper  rcscr\-oir  was 
scheduled  to  be  used  without  overflowing  the  spill-

way,  together  with  the  newl\-  constructed  Lower  Van 
Norman  Bypass  Reservoir,  during  the  reconstruction 
of  the  Lowxr  San  Fernando  Dam  which  was  sched- 
uled for  about  1973  or  1974. 

Movement  and  settlement  data  are  obtained  by 
periodic  resurveys  of  monuments  located  in  the  para- 
pet \\all  and  embedded  in  the  embankment  at  the 
center  of  the  dam  crest.  Observation  wells  have  been 
placed  on  the  downstream  slope  and  berm  to  deter- 
mine the  elevation  of  the  phreatic  line  within  the  em- 
bankment. Drains  are  provided  at  the  abutment  con- 
tacts and  toe  of  the  dam.  Flow  from  these  drains  is 
measured  regularly.  A  basin  drain  was  provided  to 
remove  any  water  that  accumulates  under  the  dumped 
backfill  in  the  area  below  the  dam.  This  drainage  sys- 
tem was  constructed  in  1965.  Sun'eillance  measure- 
ments are  made  regularly. 

Geologic  and  foundation  conditions  at  Upper  San 
Fernando  Dam  are  not  nearly  so  well  understood  as 
they  are  at  the  lower  dam.  Little  or  no  exploration  had 
been  conducted  at  the  upper  dam  up  to  the  time  of 
the  start  of  the  investigation  following  the  February  9 
earthquake.  Information  is  now  (1971)  being  obtained 
by  the  current  drilling  and  sampling  program. 

The  dam  embankment  is  known  to  be  founded  on 
Holocene  alluvium,  which  recent  exploration  has 
shown  to  be  about  50  feet  thick.  The  right  abutment 
consists  of  beds  of  the  Saugus  Formation  striking 
parallel  to  the  axis  of  the  dam  and  dipping  north- 
westerly approximately  60  degrees.  The  Saugus  For- 
mation probably  is  of  ear!\-  Pleistocene  age  and  con- 
sists of  light-colored,  well-graded,  poorly  cemented 
conglomeratic  sandstone  and  coarse-grained  sandstone. 
Some  finer-grained  phases  are  present  also.  The  Saugus 
Formation  is  believed  to  have  been  deposited  as  fluvia- 
tile  and  alluvial-fan  sediments  rather  than  as  marine 
sediments.  The  presence  of  small  to  moderate  amounts 
of  cementing  material  renders  these  sediments  rela- 
tively impenaous. 

Fanglomerate  deposits  of  the  Pacoima  Formation 
of  Pleistocene  age  cover  the  left  abutment.  It  is 
suspected,  however,  that  these  older  alluvial  sediments 
constitute  a  capping  of  the  abutment  and  that  the 
excavation  for  the  left  end  of  the  dam  and  for  the 
spillwa\'  encountered  the  underlying  beds  of  the 
Saugus  Formation,  similar  to  those  that  appear  on  the 
right  abutment  of  the  dam. 

EFFECTS  OF  THE  EARTHQUAKE 

The  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971,  which 
centered  about  10  miles  north  of  the  city  of  San 
Fernando  at  a  depth  of  about  S  miles  and  registered  6.6 
on  the  Richter  scale,  caused  loss  of  life  and  property 
throughout  the  north  portion  of  the  San  Fernando 
Valley.  Energy  released  b\-  the  earthquake  subjected 
the  Van  Norman  Reser\'oir  Complex,  1  Vz  miles  west 
of  San  Fernando,  to  severe  ground  motion.  The  Lower 
San  Fernando  Dam  was  severely  damaged  and  had  to 
be  taken  out  of  senice;  the  Upper  San  Fernando  Dam 
was  impaired  and  had  to  be  operated  at  a  lowered 
water  surface  elevation.  The  facilities  through  which 
water  discharges  into  the  Upper  \^an  Norman  Reser- 
voir were  rendered  unusable.  The  Lower  \^an  Norman 


Bypass  Reservoir  Dam  showed  surface  cracks  in  the 
asphalt  lining;  however,  no  damage  to  the  embank- 
ment or  structures  \\as  detected.  Peripheral  structures 
of  the  complex,  that  isolate  the  three  storage  reservoirs 
from  stormfiows,  apparently-  suffered  only  minor 
damage. 

Lower  Son  Fernando  Dam 

The  Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  was  the  worst  dam- 
aged of  all  the  dams  in  the  complex.  The  embankment 
including  the  parapet  wall,  the  dam  crest,  most  of  the 
upstream  slope,  and  a  portion  of  the  do\\nstream  slope 
for  a  length  of  about  1800  feet  slid  into  the  reser\'oir. 
As  much  as  800,000  cubic  yards  of  dam  embankment 
may  have  been  displaced  into  the  reservoir,  resulting 
in  a  loss  of  about  30  feet  of  dam  height. 

Shortly  after  the  major  damage  to  the  dam  had 
been  assessed,  several  hundred  sandbags  were  filled  and 
stored  on  the  downstream  slope  above  the  Elevation 
1095  berm.  These  were  made  ready  for  use  in  the  event 
that  aftershocks  would  bring  about  a  significant  de- 
crease in  the  minimum  freeboard  remaining.  Because 
of  the  critically  reduced  freeboard,  the  uncertain  de- 
gree of  damage  to  the  Upper  San  Fernando  Dam  and 
the  possibility  of  strong  aftershocks,  residents  in  an 
endangered  area  below  the  dam  were  evacuated. 

The  east  outlet  tower  \\-as  cracked  at  the  base, 
broken  off  about  20  feet  above  the  base,  and  came  to 
rest  in  an  upstream  orientation.  The  sliding  earthfill 
and  concrete  slope  paving  covered  the  remaining  up- 
right stem  of  the  tower  and  blocked  the  opening  to 
the  outlet  conduit,  temporarily  restricting  flow 
through  this  outlet  to  approximatel\-  100  cfs.  Within  a 
short  period,  the  entrance  to  the  tower  stem  became 
sufficientl\-  cleared  so  that  this  outlet  was  quite  effec- 
tive in  evacuating  the  reservoir.  The  west  tower  (on 
the  right  abutment)  did  not  suffer  any  noticeable  dam- 
age and  was  used  to  dewatcr  the  resenoir  to  about 
Elevation  1091,  the  invert  of  the  lowest  operating  gate. 
During  erosion  and  clearing  of  the  debris  that  had 
blocked  the  broken  east  tower  stem,  small  pieces  of 
concrete,  as  -well  as  earth,  were  carried  into  the  outlet 
line  and  into  the  distribution  mains. 

Since  mid-1966,  the  Lower  Van  Norman  Reser- 
voir had  been  operated  at  restricted  storage,  with  maxi- 
mum operating  level  not  permitted  to  fill  above  Eleva- 
tion 1125,  about  10  feet  below  spillway  crest.  At  the 
time  of  the  earthquake,  the  reservoir  was  storing  about 
11,000  acre-feet  of  water  compared  to  its  capacity'  of 
20,500  acre-feet.  The  water  surface  elevation  was 
about  1109  and  25  feet  below  the  dam  spillway, 
about  35  feet  below  the  dam  crest.  Inflow  to  the  reser- 
voir was  about  475  cfs  via  the  Upper  \^an  Norman 
Reservoir  bypass  channel.  Upper  San  Fernando  Dam 
operating  spilhva\-,  and  Lower  V^an  Norman  B\'pass 
Reservoir  operating  spillway.  Outflow  from  the  reser- 
voir was  about  190  cfs  from  Tower  No.  1  (east), 
through  the  78-inch,  reinforced  concrete  pipe,  and 
about  200  cfs  from  Tower  No.  2  (west)  at  the  right 
abutment,  through  the  72-inch  welded  steel  pipe,  for 
a  total  of  about  390  cfs. 

As  soon  as  possible  following  the  quake,  all  the 
inflow  to  the  reservoir  was  turned  off.  As  the  center

had  slid  over  it,  combined  flow  through  both  towers 
increased  to  about  650  cfs.  Most  of  the  outflow  from 
the  towers  was  taken  into  tlie  Cit&gt;''s  delivery  system. 
Some  was  wasted  through  three  12-inch  blowofi^  valves 
discharging  into  the  unpaved  channel  downstream 
from  the  dam  and  finally  into  the  nearby  Bull  Creek 
channel.  The  Corps  of  Engineers  provided  additional 
evacuation  capacity-  by  installing  pumps  near  the  shore- 
line a  short  distance  upstream  from  the  right  outlet 
tower.  These  pumps,  having  a  combined  capacity-  of 
about  70  cfs,  discharged  into  the  Lower  San  Fernando 
spillway  chute  which  also  enters  Bull  Creek  channel. 
During  peak  evacuation,  when  all  available  outlets 
were  being  used,  a  maximum  outflow  from  Lower 
Van  Norman  Reservoir  of  about  700  cfs  was  attained. 

After  the  reservoir  surface  had  been  reduced  to  a 
safe  level,  the  flow  was  reduced  and  blended  with 
better  quality  water  to  improve  the  overall  quality  of 
water  delivered  into  the  system.  As  the  reservoir 
drained  to  the  point  where  only  unsatisfactory  water 
remained,  deliveries  into  the  system  were  curtailed  and 
the  remaining  water  was  flushed  into  Bull  Creek. 

Surveillance  data  were  taken  as  quickly  as  possible 
following  the  earthquake,  and  it  was  noted  that  seep- 
age had  increased  for  a  short  period.  Several  seepage 
flows  became  turbid  at  first,  but  all  cleared  within 
.^6  hours  after  the  'quake.  Observation  wells  were 
measured  and  showed  an  initial  rise  in  water  surface 
elevation  which  later  returned  to  normal  and  de- 
creased with  the  evacuation  of  the  reservoir.  The  seis- 
moscope  and  the  accclerograph  located  on  the  dam 
crest  opposite  the  cast  tower  went  into  the  water 
with  the  sliding  embankment  but  were  recovered 
intact  after  the  water  level  had  receded. 


Upper  San  Fernando  Dam 

The  'quake  damaged  the  Upper  San  Fernando 
Dam  by  causing  it  to  move  downstream  and  to  slump 
downhill.  The  dam  crest  moved  about  5  feet  down- 
stream and  settled  about  3  feet  vertically.  The  up- 
stream concrete  slope  paving  was  displaced  and  dam- 
aged, particularly  near  Elevation  1198,  which  is  coin- 
cident with  the  contact  between  the  "semihydraulic" 
and  wagon-rolled  embankment.  The  reservoir  was 
drawn  down  quickly  to  Elevation  1193,  then  con- 
tinued in  operation  to  provide  aqueduct  water  into 
the  City's  system.  The  outlet  tower  remained  upright 
although  considerably  damaged.  The  outlet  line  from 
the  tower  was  severely  afi'ected  by  the  dam's  move- 
ment and  several  openings  developed. 

Shortly  after  the  main  shock,  it  was  discovered 
that  very  muddy  water  was  issuing  from  the  down- 
stream toe  of  the  dam.  This  water  appeared  to  be 
coming  from  around  the  outside  of  the  old  outlet 
line,  wiiich  was  in  use.  After  the  gates  in  the  outlet 
tower  were  closed  along  with  a  gate  downstream  in 
the  outlet  line  and  the  pressure  removed  from  this 
portion  of  the  line  between  the  tower  and  the  closed 
gate  by  opening  two  blowoff  valves,  the  flow  at  the 
toe  of  the  dam  dropped  to  an  insignificant  rate  (15 
to  20  gpm)  and  cleared  up  considerably.  These  valve 
operations  stopped  po.ssible  serious  erosion  of  the 
dam. 

The  .second  outlet  through  the  west  (right) 
embankment  withstood  the  'quake  without  any  visi- 
ble damage  and  remained  operable.  The  concrete  open 
clianncl  spillwa&gt;'  at  the  left  end  of  the  dam  was 
cracked  transversely  downstream  of  the  crest  and 
bulged   through  a  portion  of  the  chute   section.  In

line  with  the  transverse  crack  was  the  Upper  Van

to  accept  flow  directly  from  the  aqueduct  and  by- 
pass the  pumping  plant  and/or  the  reservoir,  with 
discharge  into  Lower  \^an  Norman  Reservoir.  The 
lining  of  the  bypass  channel  and  entrance  into  the 
spillway  chute  were  quite  badly  damaged. 

The  water  surface  elevation  at  the  time  of  the 


'quake  was  about  1213.2  or  about  0.7  foot  above  the 
spilh\ay  crest.  The  reservoir  was  spilling  into  the 
Lower  \'an  Norman  Reservoir  as  a  normal  operating 
procedure.  The  inflow  to  the  City  system  was  about 
485  cfs  from  the  First  Aqueduct  and  75  cfs  from 
the  Second  Aqueduct.  Of  this  total  inflow  of  560  cfs, 
the  high  elevation  suppK'  lines  which  are  serviced 
from  points  above  the  complex  were  taking  40  cfs.

Inflow  to  tiic  Upper  \'an  Norman  Reservoir  was 
400  cfs.  An  additional  45  cfs  was  taken  from  the 
Ciiatswortli  High  Line  at  a  point  between  the  Upper 
\'an  Xornian  and  the  Lower  \'an  Norinan  Bypass 
Reservoirs  leaving  475  cfs  going  into  the  Lower  Van 
Norman  Rescr\oir.  The  Upper  \'an  Norman  Reser- 
voir and  the  Lower  \'an  Norman  Bypass  Reservoir 
were  both  spilling. 

The  Second  .\qucduct  was  damaged  by  the 
'quake.  However,  it  was  being  shut  down  by  pre- 
vious scheduling  so  that  all  the  flow  was  from  the 
First  Aqueduct,  which  was  immediate!)'  closed,  re- 
sulting in  a  complete  sluitdown  of  water  entering  the 
complex.  The  First  Acjucduct,  higii  elevation  service 
lines,  the  San  Fernando  Powerplanr,  and  the  42-inch 
line  connecting  the  54-inch  tower  line  with  the  99- 
inch  Lower  \"an  Norman  B\'pass  line  downstream  of 
the  dam  were  all  damaged.  Drawdown  of  Upper  \'an 
Norman  Reservoir  was  accomplished  with  flows  of 
L50  cfs  through  the  Chatsworth  High  Line  and  be- 
tween L^O  and  225  cfs  through  two  24-inch-diamcter 
holes  cut  in  the  99-inch-diamctcr  Lower  \^an  Nor- 
man Reservoir  bypass  line  where  it  crosses  the  spill- 
way chute  at  the  Bull  Creek  channel.  The  outlet 
tower  at  Upper  San  Fernando  Dam  was  damaged  but 
standing.  The  access  bridge  to  the  tower  had  par- 
tially fallen  into  the  reservoir,  which  caused  a  delay 
in  the  closing  of  that  outlet.  This  evacuation  pro- 
cedure was  used  to  stop  the  inflow  into  the  Lower 
\'an  Norman  Reservoir,  which  was  being  drawn 
down  as  rapidiv  as  possible,  and  resulted  in  lowering 
the  water  surface  of  Upper  \'an  Norman  Reservoir 
to  about  Elevation  1193. 

Because  of  damage  to  the  powerplant,  use  of  the 
penstock  water  system  was  provided  by  connecting 
twelve  12-inch  steel  pipes  to  the  penstock  to  bypass 
the  powerplant  and  to  allow  aqueduct  water  to  enter 
the  Upper  \'an  Norman  Reservoir  through  a  tem- 
porar\'  standpipc  located  in  the  aftcrba\'  area.  Addi- 
tional water  was  delivered  via  the  cascade  through 
a  portion  of  the  repaired  reservoir  bypass  channel 
and  was  diverted  into  the  afterba&gt;'  area.  Subsequent 
repairs  were  made  to  the  remainder  of  the  bypass 
channel  to  allow  water  to  enter  downstream  from  the 
east  directh'  into  tiic  reservoir  instead  of  through  the 
afterbay  as  was  done  prcviouslw  .\  120-inch  b\-pass 
line  is  being  constructed  and  will  be  in  operation 
sometime  in  .August  1971. 

The  drainage  system  of  the  Upper  San  Fernando 
Dam  received  an  increase  in  inflow  and  some  struc- 
tural damage  as  indicated  by  the  gravel  carried 
through  the  cast  contact  drain  into  the  measuring 
vault,  which  was  distorted  b\'  the  'quake. 

Lower  Van  Norman  Bypass  Reservoir 

The  Lower  \'an  Norman  B)-pass  Dam,  which  is 
located  along  the  west  side  of  Lower  \'an  Norman 
Reservoir,  was  not  damaged  by  the  earthquake  of 
Fcbruar\-  9,  1971,  except  for  limited  superficial  crack- 
ing of  the  asphalt-concrete  lining.  .Minor  cracks  were 
observed  in  the  lining  on  both  the  upstream  and 
downstream  faces  of  the  dam.  The  dam  embankment 
was  inspected  at  these   locations  b\-   cutting  through 


the  asphalt  lining,  and  no  distortion  or  damage  to 
the  dam  embankment  was  found. 

At  the  time  of  the  'quake,  the  reservoir  was 
spilling  into  Lower  \'an  Norman  Reservoir.  The  in- 
flow to  the  bypass  reservoir  at  this  time  was  120  cfs 
froiu  the  Upper  San  Fernando  Reservoir,  and  all  this 
inflow  was  spilling  into  Lower  \'an  Norman  Reser- 
voir because  gates  in  lines  leading  off  the  99-inch 
bypass  reservoir  outlet  line  were  closed.  After  the 
'quake,  the  operation  was  modified  as  soon  as  pos- 
sible so  as  to  prevent  overflow  into  the  Lower  Van 
Norman  Reservoir,  which  was  being  drawn  down. 
Fluctuations  are  now  being  restricted  to  elevations 
below  the  operating  spillwa\-  crest  and  are  dependent 
on  dow  nstrcam  service  and  storage  demand. 

The  drainage  s\stem  of  this  dam  has  not  been 
affected  b\'  the  'quake;  and  the  movement  and  settle- 
ment information,  together  with  the  surficial  inspec- 
tion, indicate  that  this  reservoir  is  safe  for  normal 
operation. 

SOILS  INVESTIGATIONS  FOLLOWING  THE  EARTHQUAKE 

Immediatel\-  following  the  February  9  earth- 
quake, it  was  clear  that  this  unusual  event  required 
an  immediate  and  thorough  investigation.  Not  only 
would  it  be  necessary  to  learn  what  had  happened 
at  the  San  Fernando  Dams,  but  also  why  and  whether 
it  might  happen  at  other  similar  dams  under  similar 
circumstances.  In  order  to  have  the  most  knowledge- 
able and  up-to-date  expert  information  in  the  field  of 
dynamic  soils  testing  and  the  analysis  of  earth  em- 
bankments under  seismic  conditions.  Dr.  H.  Bolton 
Seed,  Chairman  of  the  Department  of  Civil  Engineer- 
ing, Universit&gt;'  of  California,  Berkeley,  was  retained 
by  the  Division  of  Safety  of  Dams.  ^Vith  the  con- 
currence of  the  Los  Angeles  Department  of  Water 
and  Power,  he  was  requested  to  formulate  and  direct 
a  soils  investigation  of  the  two  damaged  San  Fernando 
Dams. 

AVith  Dr.  Kenneth  Lee  and  others  from  the  Uni- 
versity, Dr.  Seed  immediately  laid  the  groundwork 
for  an  investigation  program  at  both  dams.  A  co- 
operative program  was  developed  jointly  with  the 
Los  .\ngelcs  Department  of  AVater  and  Power  and 
the  California  Department  of  \A'atcr  Resources.  The 
following  paragraphs  describe  briefls'  the  principal 
aspects  of  Dr.  Seed's  recommended  exploration  pro- 
grams.

walls  of  the  trenches. 

4.  Drill  about  15  or  20  test  holes  4  or  5  inches 
in  diameter  b\'  rotary  methods,  in  three  lines 
transverse  to  the  dam  axis,  close  to  the  three 
trenches  or  their  upstream  and  downstream 
extensions.  Such  holes  are  to  be  spaced  ap- 
proximately equidistant  from  one  another, 
from  the  upstream  face  to  the  downstream 
toe,  and  to  extend  to  bedrock  or  a  short  dis- 
tance into  bedrock. 

5.  Obtain  undisturbed  samples  from  the  drill 
holes  described  above,  at  5-foot  intervals.  Ob- 
tain penetration  resistance  values  by  standard 
penetration  sampler  at  5-foot  intervals  in  be- 
tween the  undisturbed  samples.  For  the  three 
holes  in  the  core  zone,  substitute  vane  shear 
testing  for  the  standard  penetration  resistance 
testing. 

6.  Drill  large-diameter  bucket-auger  holes  to  ex- 
plore for  slide  surfaces. 

7.  Conduct  downhole  seismic  exploration  in  four 
to  six  drill  holes  to  determine  shear  wave 
velocity  of  the  different  media  in  and  under- 
lying the  dam. 

Upper  San  Fernando  Dam 

The  investigation  at  Upper  San  Fernando  Dam 
paralleled  the  one  at  the  lower  dam,  with  the  excep- 
tion of  the  mapping  (items  1  and  2).  In  addition,  the 
City's  need  for  maintaining  the  Los  Angeles  aqueduct 
system  in  service  has  required  continued  use  of  the 
upper  reservoir.  Therefore,  it  was  drawn  down  only 
enough  to  make  immediate  repairs  then  restored  to 
a  reduced  working  level.  Thus,  exploration  is  neces- 
sarily limited  upstream  of  the  crest. 

STUDY  OF  THE  LOWER  SAN  FERNANDO  DAM  SLIDE 

A  very  preliminary  analysis  of  the  major  slide 
which  occurred  at  the  Lower  San  Fernando  Dam  was 
made  by  H.  Bolton  Seed,  K.  L.  Lee,  and  L  M.  Idriss, 
based  on  assumed  soil  characteristics.  The  following 
is  briefly  adapted  from  their  report. 

The  epicenter  of  the  earthquake,  which  had  a  magnitude 
of  6.6,  was  located  about  8  miles  northeast  of  the  domsite, 
but  evidence  of  fault  breaks  was  found  within  a  mile  or  so  of 
the  dam.  Very  strong  shaking  was  developed  for  a  period  of 
about  12  seconds,  and  strong  motion  records  Indicate  thot 
ground  motions  in  the  vicinity  of  the  dam  probably  had  a 
maximum  acceleration  of  about  0.4  to  0.5  g. 

The  slide  occurred  on  the  upstream  face  of  the  dam,  taking 
out  the  crest  and  the  upper  30  feet  of  soil  on  the  down- 
stream slope.  As  previously  noted,  at  the  time  of  the  earth- 
quake, the  water  level  in  the  reservoir  was  about  35  feet 
below  the  crest,  leaving  about  4  feet  of  soil  as  the  remaining 
freeboard.  Eighty  thousand  people  living  downstream  of  the 
dam  were  immediately  ordered  to  evacuate,  and  the  water 
level  in  the  reservoir  was  lowered  as  rapidly  as  possible;  for- 
tunately, no  further  movements  developed.  However,  the  mar- 
gin by  which  a  major  disaster  was  averted  was  uncomfortably 
small.  If  the  City  had  not  been  operating  the  reservoir  at  a 
water  level  lower  than  normal,  if  the  earthquake  shaking  had 
continued  for  a  few  seconds  longer,  or  if  the  Upper  San 
Fernando  dam,  which  moved  downstream  5  feet  during  the 
earthquake,  had   released  additional  water  into  the  reservoir. 


the  remaining  embankment  could  have  been  overtopped.  The 
Los  Angeles  Department  of  Water  and  Power  and  the  Cali- 
fornia Department  of  Water  Resources  (Division  of  Safety  of 
Dams)  are  making  detailed  studies  of  the  slide  to  ensure  that 
similar  events  will  not  occur  in  the  future. 

Seismic  Stability  Investigations  Prior  to  the  Earthquake 

In  a  general  review  of  the  seismic  stability  of 
earth  dams  throughout  California,  conducted  in  1966, 
the  earthquake  resistance  of  the  Lower  San  Fernando 
Dam  \\'as  investigated  by  means  of  a  conventional 
anal\'sis  procedure  using  a  seismic  coefficient  of  0.15. 
This  value  was  recommended,  based  on  the  known 
and  expected  seismicity  of  the  region,  b\-  a  consulting 
board  appointed  by  the  Los  Angeles  Department  of 
Water  and  Power. 

The  strength  of  the  soil  comprising  the  embank- 
ment A\as  determined  by  means  of  direct  shear  and 
triaxial  compression  tests  on  undisturbed  samples.  The 
rate  of  loading  in  these  tests  ma\'  have  been  too  fast 
for  full  drainage  of  the  samples  to  occur,  but  the  data 
were  interpreted  conservatively  to  provide  strength 
parameters  for  analytical  purposes. 

Stability  computations  were  made  using  the  con- 
ventional method  of  slices  for  the  combined  effects  of 
(1)  an  earthquake  represented  by  a  seismic  coefficient 
of  0.15  and  (2)  a  partial  drawdown  of  the  reservoir 
level  from  El.  1125  to  El.  1100.  These  computations 
showed  a  minimum  factor  of  safety  of  1.01.  Using  an 
effective  angle  of  friction  of  35°  for  the  sand  in  the 
shells  of  the  embankment,  the  computed  factor  of 
safety  would  have  been  about  1.08  for  a  seismic  coef- 
ficient of  0.1. 

Based  on  the  results  of  these  studies,  it  was  con- 
cluded that,  since  the  method  of  analysis  was  based  on 
conser\'ative  strength  values  and  force  applications  in 
keeping  with  conventional  practice,  the  dam  was  safe 
against  an\'  anticipated  ground  motion  if  the  water 
level  were  not  allowed  to  exceed  Elevation  1125.  The 
reservoir  has  been  operated  with  this  restriction  during 
the  past  few  years. 

Preliminary  Analysis  of  the  Lower 
San  Fernando  Dam  Slide 

The  slide  which  occurred  in  the  Lower  San  Fer- 
nando Dam  during  the  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971, 
was  due  to  liquefaction  of  the  hydraulic  fill  on  the  up- 
stream side  of  the  embankment  as  evidenced  by  the  ex- 
tent of  lateral  movement  of  the  slide  material.  Ad- 
ditional evidence  of  the  degree  of  liquefaction  of  the 
soil  was  also  provided  by  the  performance  of  the  pile- 
supported  footing  of  the  footbridge  to  the  central  in- 
take tower.  After  the  slide  occurred,  the  slender  steel 
piles,  still  standing  verticall\-  and  supporting  the  foot- 
ing, projected  about  15  feet  above  the  soil  below, 
which  had  moved  horizontally  about  70  feet  from  its 
original  positions.  Thus  a  large  quantity  of  slide  ma- 
terial moved  around  and  through  these  piles  without 
causing  any  significant  lateral  deformation;  it  is  dif- 
ficult to  imagine  how  this  could  have  occurred  \\'ithout 
a  high  degree  of  liquefaction  in  the  surrounding  soil. 
The  movement  of  this  foundation  also  indicates  that 
the  base  of  the  slide  extended  well  down  towards  the 
base  of  the  embankment.

A  preliminary  annl&gt;'sis  of  rhc  liquefaction  po- 
tential of  tlic  soil  in  rhc  embankment  has  been  made 
using  the  simplified  analysis  procedure  suggested  by 
Seed"  and  Idriss  (1970);  that  is,  by  comparing  the 
cyclic  stress  conditions  induced  by  the  earthquake 
with  those  determined,  either  on  the  basis  of  previous 
field  experience  or  by  laboratory  tests,  to  cause  lique- 
faction of  the  soil. 

Stress  Conditions  Causing  Liquefaction  and 
Evaluation  of  Liquefaction  Potential 

Several  years  ago,  a  number  of  borings  were  made 
to  determine  the  characteristics  of  the  embankment 
soils.  It  was  found  that  the  material  graded  gradually 
from  a  coarse  sand  and  gravel  near  the  outer  portion 
of  the  shells  through  coarse  sand  and  fine  sand  to  a 
claye\'  core  near  the  center.  The  main  part  of  the  em- 
bankment consisted  therefore  of  cohesionless  soil  rang- 
ing from  fine  sand  to  sandy  gravel  with  the  general 
characteristics  of  coarse  sand. 

An  evaluation  of  the  liquefaction  potential  of  the 
different  sections  of  the  embankment  may  be  made  by 
comparing  the  stress  ratios  induced  by  the  earthquake 
\\ith  the  stress  ratio  likely  to  produce  liquefaction,  pre- 
viously determined  to  be  about  0.23.  For  an  earth- 
quake similar  to  the  February  9  shock,  producing  crest 
accelerations  of  about  0.4  g,  liquefaction  would  be  ex- 
pected over  a  substantial  depth  range  under  the  up- 
stream slope.  However,  the  computed  stress  ratios 
show  that  liquefaction  is  not  likely  to  develop  in  the 


downstream  portion  of  the  emt)ankment.  This  is  in 
reasonable  accord  with  the  actual  slide  movement. 

On  the  basis  of  preliminar\'  and  necessarily  ap- 
proximate analysis,  the  embankment  might  have  with- 
stood about  10  seconds  of  ground  shaking  producing 
a  maximum  crest  acceleration  of  about  0.3  g.  However, 
since  there  are  likel\-  to  be  zones  in  the  embankment 
where  the  relative  density  soil  is  somewhat  less  than  55 
percent,  the  maximum  crest  acceleration  for  which 
liquefaction  would  not  have  occurred  might  be  of  the 
order  of  0.27  g;  the  corresponding  base  acceleration 
would  be  about  0.20  g. 

Similarly,  if  the  relative  density  of  the  embank- 
ment soils  had  been  about  75  pei-cent,  the  embankment 
might  well  have  been  able  to  withstand  the  intense 
shaking  without  liquefaction  or  detrimental  deforma- 
tion. For  earthquakes  of  greater  magnitude,  for  which 
shaking  would  be  of  longer  duration,  limiting  accelera- 
tion would  be  somewhat  lower  than  indicated  above. 

While  the  preceding  analysis  is  grossK-  simplified, 
it  seems  to  provide  a  reasonable  picture  of  the  mechan- 
ism of  slope  failure  and  the  conditions  causing  the 
major  slide  in  the  Lower  San  Fernando  Dam.  .As  fur- 
ther information  is  developed,  based  on  measurements 
of  site  conditions,  laboratory  determinations  of  soil 
characteristics,  and  more  complete  determinations  of 
stress  conditions  w  ithin  the  embankment,  it  is  expected 
that  the  mechanics  of  sliding  at  the  Lower  San  Fer- 
nando Dam  will  be  well  defined.  Knowledge  gained 
from  this  investigation  should  be  extraordinarily  useful 
in  anal\zing  the  effects  of  earthquakes  on  other  hy- 
draulic fill  dams. 


CHAPTER  30 


An  Engineering  Study  of  fhe 

Behavior  of  Public  Utilities  Systems  in  the 

Son  Fernondo  Earthquake  of  February  9,  1971 ' 


by  Donald  F.  Moran  ^  and  C.  Martin  Duke  ' 


The  utility  systems  are  some  of  the  essential  "life- 
lines" of  the  community.  Disruption  of  these  "lifelines" 
can  result  in  financial  loss,  disruption  of  normal  and 
emergency  operations,  and  loss  of  life. 

Financial  losses  were  large  (22  million  dollars  at 
Sylmar  Converter  Station  alone),  and  the  loss  of  life 
among  the  80,000  persons  living  below  the  heavily 
damaged  Lower  Van  Norman  Dam  could  have  been 
great  (figure  1).  Loss  of  electrical  energy  and  commu- 
nications crippled  emergenc\'  operations,  and  gas  leak- 
age caused  some  nonstructural  fires. 

Damage  to  utilities  generally  followed  the  same 
pattern  as  in  past  earthquakes.  Buried  conduits  were 
damaged  where  permanent  earth  movements  occurred; 
equipment,  when  not  properly  anchored  and  braced, 
was  severely  damaged  and  some  old  nonearthquake- 
resistant  buildings  and  hydraulic-fill  dams  were  nearly 
destroyed. 

One  of  the  most  significant  aspects  of  this  earth- 
quake is  the  amount  of  attention  that  has  been  directed 
toward  the  behavior  of  utilities  and  toward  improving 
the  "state  of  the  art"  of  earthquake  engineering  of  this 
"lifeline." 

Prior  to  the  February  9,  1971,  earthquake,  the 
"state  of  the  art"  of  earthquake  engineering  in  the 
public-utility  sector  was  low  when  compared  to  earth- 
quake engineering  of  buildings.  However,  there  were 
some  notable  exceptions. 

Following  the  Long  Beach  Earthquake  of  1933, 
several  electric  utility  companies  realized  the  impor- 
tance of  the  continuing  operation  of  their  critical  fa- 
cilities in  the  event  of  a  severe  earthquake.  As  a  result 
the\'  adopted  increased  lateral-force  factors  in  the 
design  of  important  plants  and  equipment.  They  arbi- 
traril\-  doubled  the  !0-percent-of-gravit\  lateral-force 
factor  which  was  generalh'  being  used  in  codes  at  that 
time. 

The  superior  performance,  in  the  February  9 
earthquake,  of  electrical  facilities  designed  in  accord- 
ance w  ith  these  conservative  standards  emphasizes  the

wisdom  of  those  decisions.  There  are  still  some  weak 
links,  generally  in  electrical  equipment,  that  require 
additional  research  and  the  development  of  design 
criteria.  A  re-examination  of  the  arbitrary  20-percent- 
of-gravity  factor  is  also  in  order.  It  would  be  more 
rea,sonable  to  use  the  spectral-response  approach  con- 
sidering actual  earthquake  motions  and  then  design  for 
the  acceptable  level  of  damage. 

Some  time  after  1933,  the  telephone  companies 
also  adopted  lateral-force  design  criteria  for  anchorage 
and  bracing  of  equipment.  This  practice  was  effective 
in  that  only  isolated  damage  f)ccurred,  and  that  where 
these  criteria  were  not  observed. 

Similar  steps  were  taken  in  the  liquid-fuels  field 
and  results  are  encouraging. 

Earthquake  forces  have  not  generally  been  con- 
sidered in  the  design  of  buried  conduits  and  other 
buried  structures.  Above-ground  water  tanks  have  re- 
ceived some  attention  but  need  much  more. 

This  report  summarizes  what  utilities  existed  prior 
to  the  earthquake  and  what  damage  the\-  sustained. 
Reasons  for  the  damage  are  presented  where  they  are 
known  at  this  time,  including  relation  to  permanent 
ground-movements  as  they  affected  utilities. 

Recommendations  for  improvements  are  not  in- 
cluded since  they  are  still  in  the  process  of  evaluation 
and  development. 

The  information  presented  in  this  report  is  a  brief 
summary  of  subcommittee  reports  for  a  complete 
report  prepared  by  the  Earthquake  Engineering  Re- 
search Institute  (EERI)  for  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA),  Department  of 
Commerce. 

The  authors  are  indebted  to  the  various  subcom- 
mittees of  the  EERI/NOAA  San  Fernando  Earthquake 
Investigation  Committee  concerned  with  utilities,  and 
to  the  agencies  and  utilities  they  represent,  for  their 
generous  assistance  in  the  preparation  of  this  prelim- 
inarv  summarv. 


WATER  SYSTEMS 

Included  in  this  section  are  supply  systems  con- 
sisting of  aqueducts  and  wells;  major  distribution 
systems;  storage  in  dams  and  tanks;  treatment  plants; 
and  minor  distribution  s\stcms.  Dams  are  covered  in 
detail  in  other  papers  in  this  Bulletin  (Cortright)  and

are  included  here  nnl\'  in  that  the\-  are  parts  of  water 
systems. 

Supply  Systems 

The  major  suppl\'  s\stems  include  the  California 
Aqueduct,  Metropolitan  \\'atcr  District  (.MWD) 
Colorado  River  Aqueduct,  and  Los  x\ngeles  Depart- 
ment of  Water  and  Po\\er  Aqueducts  (figure  2). 

The  California  Aqueduct  crosses  the  Garlock  and 
San  Andreas  faults  at  several  locations  in  open  channel. 
Other  major  facilities  of  this  system  in  the  earthquake 
area  include  two  pumping  plants  (Oso  and  Pearblos- 
som)  and  one  dam  (Castaic).  These  structures  were 
designed  to  resist  a  static  lateral  force  based  on  50 
percent  of  gravity  and  a  vertical  force  factor  of  3? 
percent  of  gravity.  In  addition,  articulation  was  pro- 
vided in  critical  areas  of  civil,  mechanical,  and  elec- 
trical features  to  allow  for  vertical  or  horizontal  move- 
ments that  may  occur  due  to  the  different  responses 
of  these  features  to  ground  shaking.  Inspection  con- 
ducted immediately  following  the  earthquake  revealed 
no  structural  damage  to  any  of  these  facilities,  although 
some  suspended  light-fixtures  in  buildings  and  light- 
weight shelf-items  required  some  attention. 

The  Colorado  River  Aqueduct  was  not  damaged. 

Two  aqueducts  of  the  LADWP  have  a  terminus 
in  the  heavily  shaken  area  (figure  1).  The  first  aque- 
duct, constructed  prior  to  1913,  was  badly  cracked  in 
the  cascades  and  in  high-speed  and  by-pass  channels 
but  was  made  operable  by  February  16,  1971.  A  21- 


milc  section  of  the  first  aqueduct  from  the  terminus 
northward  was  drained  and  inspected.  This  section 
consists  primarily  of  tunnel  reaches  lined  with  unre- 
inforced  concrete.  Inspection  revealed  hundreds  of 
new  fractures  in  the  concrete  lining  (photo  1).  These 
cracks  were  repaired  by  chipping  to  a  depth  of  I  inch 
and  resealing  w  ith  mortar. 

A  penstock  section  of  the  first  aqueduct  was  dam- 
aged because  of  severe  vertical  and  horizontal  move- 
ment. Reinforced-concrete  anchor  blocks  were  shat- 
tered as  the  pipe  elongated  at  two  expansion  joints. 
Supporting  piers  were  displaced  horizontally  and 
verticalK-  (photo  2). 

The  second  Los  Angeles  Aqueduct  was  being  shut 
down  at  the  time  of  the  earthquake.  Damage  was  ex- 
tensive to  the  76-inch-diameter  welded-stcel  part  of 
this  aqueduct  north  of  Terminal  Hill.  A  massive  slide 
moved  foundations  and  did  serious  damage  to  pipes 
(photo  3).  Repairs  to  this  aqueduct  were  not  com- 
pleted until  April  8,  1971. 

The  cascades  for  the  second  aqueduct  are  a  heav- 
ily reinforced  concrete  box  section  which  sustained 
only  minor  cracking. 

Wells 

Approximatel\'  21  water  wells  were  located  in  the 
epiccntral  area.  Eleven  of  these  are  owned  and  oper- 
ated by  the  LADWP;  seven  are  Cit\-  of  San  Fernando 
wells;  and  three  are  owned  b\-  the  County  of  Los 
Angeles.

All  of  the  21  wells  were  drilled  in  rhc  uiiconsoli- 
d;ncd  sand,  gra\cl,  and  finer  sediments  iindcrlxing  the 
rel;ui\cly  flat  surface  of  the  San  Fernando  X'allcw  The 
wells  are  in  the  area  of  se\erc  difTerential  ground 
niovcnienr. 

Of  the  21  wells,  20  withstood  the  severe  ground- 
shaking  and  movement  withf)ut  an\'  appreciable  dam- 
age. One  well,  in  the  cit\'  of  San  Fernando,  was  se- 
\crcl\-  damaged  h\  the  earthquake.  The  major  impact 
of  the  earthquake  on  the  wells  in  the  cit\-  of  San 
Fernando  was  the  contamination  resulting  from  dam- 
age to  well  casing,  and  the  man\-  broken  sewer  lines 
and  septic  tanks  in  the  area. 

The  condition  of  the  wells  was  judged  principally 
b\'  comparing  yield,  sand  content  of  w  ater,  action  of 
the  pump,  and  the  results  of  bacteriological  tests  prior 
to  and  after  the  earthquake. 
Major  Distribution  Systems 

The  Metropolitan  Water  District  and  the  Los 
Angeles  Department  of  \Vater  and  Power  are  the  onl\' 
organizations  with  extensive  major  water-distribution 
facilities  in  the  earthquake-afTected  area.  The  MWD's 
500  miles  of  distribution  pipelines  and  tunnels  outside 
of  this  area  came  through  the  earthquake  with  rel- 
ativel\-  little  damage,  and  delivery  of  water  to  the 
District's  26-member  agencies  continued  without  in- 
terruption (figure  2).  Both  agencies,  on  the  other 
hand,  had  considerable  damage  to  their  major  distribu- 
tion facilities  in  the  San  Fernando  \'allev  area.

The  iMW'l^  sustained  damage  to  its  Balboa  Inlet 
Tunnel  and  San  Fernando  Tunnel  (figure  I),  which 
were  still  under  construction.  The  Balboa  Inlet  Tunnel 
is  14  feet  in  diameter  and  appro\imatel\-  1  mile  long. 
At  a  point  about  1  ."^OO  feet  from  the  downstream  ter- 
minus, this  tunnel  was  damaged  for  a  distance  of  about 
100  feet  near  the  fault  crossing.  The  concrete  tunnel 
lining  was  badly  spalled  and  cracked,  and  some  of  the 
reinforcing  steel  was  deformed  but  not  broken  (photo 
4). 

The  San  Fernando  Tunnel  is  18  feet  in  diameter 
and  29,000  feet  in  length.  At  the  time  of  the  earthquake 
the  tunnel  was  about  two-thirds  excavated,  being 
driven  from  the  east  portal.  Damage  was  very  minor, 
consisting  principalh'  of  cracking  and  spalling  of  a  few 
of  the  concrete  tunnel  supports.  However,  surveys 
indicate  that  the  east  portal  of  the  tunnel  is  now  7 
feet  higher  relative  to  the  Magazine  Can\on  Shaft. 
This  is  not  expected  to  have  any  serious  effect  upon 
the  h\-draulics  or  the  operation  of  the  tunnel,  as  it  Mill 
be  operated  as  a  pressure  conduit. 

The  L.-\D\\'P  sustained  damage  to  two  welded- 
steel  trunk  lines;  the  Granada  (photo  5)  and  Susana 
Trunk  Fines;  and  two  concrete  gravitx'  conduits,  the 
Maclay  and  Chatsworth  High  Fines.  One  of  the  res- 
ervoir towers  in  the  Fowcr  \'an  Norman  Reservoir 
(figure  1)  sheared  at  its  base  and  toppled  over  while 
the  other  stood  intact,  although  it  \\  as  severel\-  cracked. 
Neither  of  these  towers  had  been  designed  to  resist 
carth(]uake  forces.  Two  other  major  lines,  also  in  the 
area  that  suffered  the  greatest  damage  to  other  facil- 
ities, w  ere  not  damaged  significantl\'. 

Storage  Facilities 

Fable  I  is  a  partial  summary  of  storage  facilities 
in  the  area  and  damage  to  each. 

Damage  to  old  wood  roofs  is  to  be  expected  since 
the\  were  not  designed  to  resist  lateral  forces  due  to 
carth(|uakes.  Damage  to  modern  wcldcd-steel  tanks  is 
disturbing  and  indicates  that  l)etter  design-criteria  must 
be  developed. 


The  damage  to  the  underground  concrete-finished 
water  reservoir  at  the  Jensen  Filtration  Plant  poses  an 
mteicsting  problem.  Prior  to  this  carthduake,  antiseis- 
mic  design  of  undergrounil  structures  received  little 
attention.  Behavior  of  the  finished  \\  ater  reservoir  was 
apparentlv  much  like  buildings  above  ground.  The 
roof  diaphragm  failed  at  pour-lines  adjacent  to  extc- 
rif)r  walls,  and  subsequent  lateral  movements  caused 
damage  to  exterior  w  alls  and  interior  colunuis  (photos 
6  and  7).

The  failure  of  the  Lower  and  Upper  \'an  Norman 
13ams  is  covered  in  detail  in  other  papers.  (See  Cort- 
right,  this  Bulletin).  These  are  h\draulic  earth-fill  dams 
originally  built  during  1912  to  1915.  Loss  of  reservoir 
capacit\-  due  to  near-failures  of  these  dams  has  seriously 
reduced  water  storage  capacity'  in  this  area. 

None  of  the  compacted-fill  debris  dams  in  the 
region  of  strong  shaking  sustained  an\-  significant  dam- 
age, though  there  was  some  damage  to  their  spillwa\'S 
and  outlet  structures.  Some  transverse  cracking  was 
found  at  the  crest  of  some  of  the  dams,  due  perhaps 
to  a  "w  hipping"  action  during  the  earthquake.  Explor- 
ation indicated  that  the  cracks  were  shallow  and  did 
not  affect  the  integrit\-  of  the  structures.  The  con- 
crete-arch Pacoima  Dam,  on  a  rock  foundation,  with- 
stood the  strongest  ground  motion  ever  recorded 
w  ithout  significant  damage  to  the  concrete  structure. 

Treatment  Facilities 

The  largest  treatment  plant  in  the  hea\il\-  shaken 
area  was  the  S4.^-million  Joseph  Jensen  Filtration  Plant 
which  was  under  construction  and  about  S5  percent 
complete  (figure  1). 

Damage  to  portions  of  the  plant  was  extensive, 
particularly  in  the  area  of  the  finished  w  atcr  reservoir 
(discussed  previously  under  storage  facilities)  and  por- 
tions of  the  effluent  conduit.  .\  major  landslide  occurred 
in  the  fill  area  at  the  southeast  portion  of  the  site.  This 
slide  had  a  plan  dimension  of  about  2500  feet  by  800

easterly  movement  of  about  3  to  5  feet. 

This  landslide  had  a  detrimental  effect  on  struc- 
tures. Most  of  the  existing  e.xposed  and  buried  struc- 
tures in  the  north  area  of  the  slide  moved  eastward  on 
the  order  of  Yi  to  1  foot,  causing  many  expansion 
joints  to  open. 

The  south  area  of  the  site  contained  the  finished 
water  reservoir,  effluent  conduit,  overflow  conduit, 
and  the  Bee  Can\-on  storm  drain.  The  damage  to  the 
effluent  and  overflow  conduits  (photo  13)  and  the 
storm  drain  consisted  primarily  of  slight  to  moderate 
distress  in  joints  w  hich  C)pened  ]A  to  3  inches. 

The  mixing  and  settling  basins  are  underlain  b\' 
compacted  fill  ranging  in  thickness  from  a  knife  edge 


near  the  middle  of  the  settling  basins  to  approximately 
30  feet  at  the  east  end  of  the  mixing  basins.  Settlement 
of  the  basins  \\  as  in  direct  proportion  to  the  fill  depth, 
up  to  about  5  inches  at  the  east  wall  of  the  mixing 
basins.  Structural  distress  of  the  basins  was  minor  and 
consisted  basicalh*  of  opening  of  expansion  joints  and 
minor  joint  spalling,  as  well  as  damage  to  the  launder 
troughs  which  had  not  yet  been  secured  to  the  col- 
umns (photo  14). 

The  chemical  building  sustained  failures  of  struc- 
tural-steel members  (photo  15).  The  service-center 
building  had  fairl\'  severe  cracking  and  spalling  at 
w  all-to-floor  connections,  particularly-  w  here  the  two 
w  ings  of  the  building  connect.

voir was  turbid. 

.Ail  chlorination  and  treatment  installations  were 
reported  operating,  and  no  serious  damage  was  found. 
The  \'an  Norman  area  lost  the  operating  power  sup- 
pl&gt;'  and  had  to  operate  on  cmergenc\-  equipment. 
Power  was  lo.st  at  the  Macla)'  High  Line  Chlorination 
Station,  and  emergenc\"  equipment  was  used. 

The  recently  completed  program  of  securing  all 
chlorine  cxiiiulcrs  l)y  chains  and  load-hinders  undouht- 
edl\'  prevented  broken  connectors,  ilaniage  to  tiic 
chlorination  facilities,  and  release  of  chlorine  liquid 
and  gas. 

.\ftcr  the  initial  inspection  of  facilities,  emergency 
operating  procedures  were  started.  Chlorine  dosage 
was  increased  in  some  s\stems.  F,mcrtienc\    chlorina-

Minor  Distribution  Systems 

The  damage  to  potable  w  ater  distribution  s\stcm 
scriouslx  disrupted  the  supply  in  S\lmar  and  San  Fer- 
nando. Broken  underground  piping  interrupted  service, 
re(]uiring  the  use  of  tank  trucks  to  haul  emergencx' 
supplies.  Fortunatel\-  the  total  area  so  affected  was 
small  and  there  \\  as  ample  water  which  could  be  piped 
in  from  outside  areas.

maintained  with  the  City  of  Los  Angeles  system  for 
backup. 

Earthquake  damage  to  the  water  lines  in  San  Fer- 
nando occurred  mainly  in  the  northwestern  corner  of 
the  city.  This  area  is  bounded  by  Eighth  Street  on  the 
north,  Glenoaks  Boulevard  on  the  south,  Orange 
Grove  Avenue  on  the  east,  and  Hubbard  Avenue  on 
the  west  and  is  within  the  zone  of  intense  surface 
rupturing  (figure  3). 

In  the  extreme  northern  section  of  San  Fernando, 
the  U.  S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  replaced  the 
heavily  damaged  underground  piping  with  a  surface 
system.  In  other  city  areas  the  Metropolitan  Water 
District,  City  of  Pasadena,  City  of  Burbank,  and  City 
of  Long  Beach  furnished  emergency  repair  crews  and 
MWD  temporarily  connected  to  one  of  their  supply 
lines. 

The  principal  damage  in  the  water  lines  was  to 
the  pipe  joints  which  were  crushed;  bells  and  spigots 
were  broken;  and  joints  opened  and  misaligned  (photo 


16).  The  most  prevalent  damage  to  uncoated-steel 
water  mains  was  very  small  holes  resulting  from 
internal  water  pressure  on  pipe  walls  \\eakened  by 
corrosion  and  earthquake  movement.  There  was  some 
damage  where  pipe-repair  clamps  had  been  installed. 

There  was  widespread  damage  to  cast-iron  pipe, 
taking  the  form  of  circumferential  cracks  resulting 
from  the  earth  movement.  In  locations  where  the 
movement  of  the  earth  was  more  pronounced,  some 
cast-iron  mains  were  shattered.  Most  joint  failures  in 
both  steel  and  cast-iron  mains  were  cement-caulked. 

The  bodies  of  some  automatic  vacuum-breaker 
and  air-release  valves  were  cracked.  In  others  the  ball 
float  was  crushed  by  the  surge  of  water.  The  bell 
connections  of  a  number  of  gate  valves,  elbows,  tees, 
and  offsets  were  broken  off. 

The  major  cause  of  damage  to  service  lines  to 
individual  customers  was  the  rigidit\-  of  the  parts  and 
connections.  Vertical  and  horizontal  ground-displace- 
ment sheared  off  ball-and-socket  elbows  and   meter

connections;  broke  service  clamps,  corporation  and 
curb  valves,  and  tubing  on  copper  services;  and  caused 
the  breakage  and  distortion  of  the  meter  casings.  The 
rigidit\-  of  galvanized  lines  resulted  in  the  breakage  of 
elbows,  couplings,  and  pipe. 

Compression  and  tension  stresses  ruptured  joints 
and  broke  meter  inlet  and  outlet  connections  (photo 
17).  Water-meter  gaskets  were  blown  by  water  surges. 

The  collapse  of  the  East  Outlet  Tower  at  the 
Lower  V^an  Norman  Reservoir  caused  sand  and  debris 
to  enter  the  water  distribution  system  and  damage  the 
water-meter  pistons,  causing  them  to  stick,  making  the 
meter  inoperable.

Pacoima  Wash,  Lopez  Canyon  Channel,  and  Glenoaks 
Boulevard  Drain,  all  in  the  San  Fernando-Sylmar  area 
(figure  1). 

There  were  separations  of  concrete-box  culverts; 
catch  basins  were  damaged;  there  was  extensive  spall- 
ing  of  concrete;  concrete  channel-walls  were  displaced; 
and  in  one  case,  a  12-  b\'  22-foot  reinforced  concrete 
box  structure  failed  over  a  length  of  about  500  feet 
where  it  crossed  the  fault  (photo  18).  Damage  was 
associated  with  permanent  ground  movement  and  not 
with  vibration. 

Sewers 

The  sewers  were  damaged  in  the  zones  of  faulting 
and  ground  cracking.  The  pattern  of  damage  was 
roughly  the  same  as  for  the  water  lines  (figure  3). 
The  types  of  sew  cr-system  damage  included  broken 
pipe,  broken  joints,  pulled  joints,  changes  in  grade, 
and  shifted  and  cracked  manhole  structures.  Essentially 


none  of  the  sewer  damage  could  be  attributed  directly 
to  ground  shaking. 

In  general,  the  more  flexible  plastic  compression 
joint  suffered  less  damage  than  the  more  rigid  type 
joints.  Also,  larger  pipes  sustained  greater  relative  dam- 
age than  the  smaller  pipes.  The  principal  damage  was 
probably  caused  by  permanent  ground  displacement 
rather  than  vibration,  although  hairline  cracks  in  pipes 
undoubtedly  resulted  from  vibration. 

Television  inspection  of  the  area's  sewers  was  nec- 
essary to  assess  the  damage.  It  is  estimated  that  about 
20  percent  of  the  sewers  will  require  replacement  or 
reconstruction.  Despite  the  extensive  damage,  all  sewers 
w'cre  kept  in  operating  condition  through  emergency 
repairs  pending  the  necessary  permanent  reconstruction. 

ELECTRICAL  UTILITIES 

Since  the  Long  Beach  earthquake  of  1933,  most 
California  electrical  utilities  have  developed  antiseismic

criteria  for  the  design  of  important  and  critical  facil- 
ities. These  criteria  are  generally  in  e.xcess  of  those 
required  by  local  building  codes.  The  behavior,  in  this 
earthquake,  of  facilities  designed  under  these  conserv- 
ative criteria  was  good.  The  most  dramatic  \\  eaknesses 
were  in  the  behavior  of  electrical  equipment.  Most  of

this  equipment  was  purchased  under  specifications 
which  required  a  lateral-force  resistance  of  about  20 
percent  of  gravity,  but  the  resulting  designs  or  instal- 
lations were  inadequate  to  resist  the  strong  lateral 
forces  in  the  cpiccntral  area.  Included  in  this  section 
are  generating  facilities,  transmission  lines,  terminals, 
s\\  itching  stations,  distributing  stations,  and  distribut- 
ing systems. 

Electrical  Generating  Facilities 

The  V'allcy  Steam  Plant  (LADWP)  with  a  gen- 
crating  capacity  of  512,000  K\\'  is  located  about  10 
miles  south  of  the  epicenter.  This  modern  plant,  in- 
cluding all  equipment,  \\  as  designed  to  resist  lateral 
forces  equi\'alent  to  about  20  percent  of  gravity.  Be- 
havior in  the  earthquake  \\as  remarkabl\'  good,  the 
only  damage  being  one  broken  lightning  arrester. 
■Maximum  ground  acceleration  in  this  area  is  estimated 
at  .^0  to  40  percent  of  gravity. 

The  San  Fernando  H\droelectric  Ceneratine  Plant 
No.  3  (LAD^^T),  is  a  small  (6000  Kw)  facility 
located  just  north  of  the  Upper  \'an  Norman  Res- 
ervoir. This  old  rcinforced-concrete  structure,  built 
in  1927,  was  not  designed  to  resist  earthquake  forces. 
The  area  beneath  and  surrounding  the  plant  subsided 
appro.ximately  2  feet  during  the  cartln]uakc.  The  struc- 
ture was  undermined  b\'  water  because  of  a  break 
in  the  inlet  penstock  near  the  turbine  case  under  the 
building.  Structural  damage  was  severe.

Two  ln\'droclcctric  generating  plants  (LADWP), 
located  in  San  Frantisquito  Can\c)n  about  14  miles 
north  of  the  epicenter,  sustained  onlv  minor  damage. 
Thc\'  were  constructed  in  1917  and  1920  of  reinforced 
concrete  witiiour  specific  antiscismic  features. 

The  San  Onofre  Xuclear  Ceneratmg  Plant  is  the 
onl\  major  nuclear  power  facilitv  within  the  general 
area,  l^ocatcd  about  S3  miles  south  of  the  epicenter, 
it  was  not  damaged.  Ma.ximum  acceleration  recorded 
at  the  site  was  only  2  percent  of  gravity.  Several 
nuclear-research  reactors  in  the  Los  Angeles  area  per- 
formed well  in  this  earthquake. 

Transmission  Lines 

Towers  for  transmission  lines  are  ilesigncd  for 
hcaxy  lateral  forces  due  to  wind  and  for  loads  due  to 
broken-conductor  conditions.  None  sustained  damage 
because  of  ground  shaking,  except  as  noted  below. 

About  49  tf)wers  of  the  L.-\D\\'P  were  affected 
b\  earth  displacement  and  fissuring.  The  foundations 
of  19  towers  were  displaced  enough  to  bend  and  dam- 
age steel  members  within  the  tow  ers.  Where  transmis- 
sion lines  cross  a  known  fault,  conductors  are  placed 
perpendicular  to  the  fault  trace  so  as  to  minimize 
change  in  span  length  due  to  fault  movement. 

ApproxiiuateK'  8K  towers  of  the  Southern  Cali- 
fornia Fdison  Cf).  (SCF.)  were  affectctl  b\'  cartii  dis- 
placement. Thc\  rc(]uired  exca\ation,  grading  backfill, 
and  compaction.  .A  number  will  recjuire  crib  walls. 
Tops  of  two  partial!)  erected  towers  toppled  o\er 
on  the  S\lmar-Gould  line  which  was  under  construc- 


tion (figure  1).  These  two  towers  of  contemporar\' 
design  had  been  temporarily  bolted  together  the  night 
before  the  earthquake,  in  preparation  for  final  w  elding. 

Electrical  Terminals 

The  S\lmar  Comerter  Station  is  the  major  elec- 
trical terminal  in  the  S\lmar-San  Fernando  area,  serv- 
ing as  the  southern  terminus  of  the  Pacific  intertie. 
This  high  \  oltage  conxerter  station  is  located  just  east 
of  the  Upper  \'an  Xorman  Reser\oir  (figure  1).  The 
area  was  affected  by  lateral  and  \ertical  soil  movement 
associated  with  a  large  areal  movement  referred  to  b\- 
some  as  the  Juvenile  Hall  Slide.  Permanent  lateral 
movements  at  the  converter  station  amounted  to  }  to 
5  feet  in  a  westcrh  direction.  In  the  same  area,  there 
w  ere  differencial  lateral  and  \ertical  permanent  urouinl 
deformations  due  to  faulting.  Survess  made  after  the 
earthquake  have  confirmed  the  presence  of  differential 
lateral  and  vertical  ground  movements  in  these  areas. 
.Manv  breaks  occurred  in  underground  conduit  runs. 

The  damage  to  building  structures  would  not  in 
itself  have  caused  shutdown  of  the  terminal.  However, 
iiiassi\e  damage  to  electrical  C()ui[imcnt  at  this  location 
will  re(]uire  18  to  24  months  to  repair  or  replace  and 
comprises  the  major  portion  of  the  estimated  22-mil- 
lion-dollar  loss — about  40  percent  of  total  value. 

The  building  structures  at  the  converter  station, 
ilesigned  for  20  percent  of  gra\it\'.  suffered  only  minor 
damage.  The  ser\  ice  building  and  \al\e  hall  arc  two 
separate  steel  structures  above  the  first  floor.  How- 
ever, below  the  first  floor  there  is  no  separation.  Most

of  tlic  dnniagc  occurred  in  the  hascinciu  ;irc;i  under  the 
building  separation.  There  was  some  settlement  of  base- 
ment walls. 

Bracing  members  and  low  concrete-apron  walls  of 
two  large,  open,  steel-frame  structures  (each  .^00  by 
^26  by  60  feet  high)  used  to  support  radio  interference 
screens  on  the  east  and  west  sides  of  the  main  intertie 
building  were  severely  damaged  l)\'  ground  movement 
(photos  19  and  20).  These  structures  arc  light;  bracing 
was  adequate  to  resist  lateral  forces  in  excess  of  100 
percent  of  gravit\'.  Other  considerations,  such  as  \\  ind, 
governed  the  bracing  design. 

In  general,  tiie  damage  to  electrical  equipment  \\  as 
caused  by  ground  xibration  rather  than  permanent  soil 
movements. 

.Ml  of  the  42  mcrcur\-arc  \alves  and  current 
ilividers  in  the  \al\e  ba\'  \vcre  damaged  (photos  21 
and  22).  The  current  dividers,  weighing  about  8000 
pounds  each,  were  hung  1)\-  four  insulators  from  the 
roof  framing  and  were  connected  to  the  valves  below . 
The  valves  were  supported  on  platforms  supported  b\' 
vertical  insulators  resting  on  the  floor. 

Failure  occurreti  at  the  insulator  suspensions  of 
all  of  the  current  dividers,  and  several  fell  to  the  floor. 
Swinging  movements  of  the  current  ilividers  damaged 
connections  to  the  valves,  and  falling  dividers  caused 
severe  damage  to  the  valves.  None  of  the  valve-support 
insulators  were  damaged. 

In  the  outdoor  vards,  there  was  severe  damage  to 
air  circuit  breakers,  filter  reactors,  and  filter  capacitor 
racks  (photos  2.^-26). 


.Analvsis  has  indicated  that  the  air  circuit-breakers 
v\  hich  have  heavy  heads  on  single  tall  porcelain  col- 
umns have  natural  periods  in  the  range  which  are 
amplified  by  periods  identified  in  ground  motion  rec- 
ords of  the  earthquake. 

The  brittle  insulator  materials  were  unable  to 
withstand  significant  bending  loads. 

\'incent  500  Kv  Substation,  Southern  California 
I  dison  (SCF,),  with  some  similar  cciuipmcnt,  sustained 
onlv  minor  damage  to  electrical  equipment.  This  sta- 
tion is  about  16  miles  northeast  of  the  epicenter. 

Switching  Stations 

The  Olive  Switching  Station  (I.AI)\\'P),  located 
half  a  mile  east  of  the  Svlmar  Converter  Station  (fig- 
ure I),  was  put  out  of  service  totallv .  Seven  trans- 
formers toppled  on  their  sides,  and  other  equipment 
was  severelv  ilamaged  (photo  27).  The  transformers 
and  ecjuipment  w  ere  not  adei]uatclv  anchored. 

Other  switching  stations  of  i,.ADA\'P  and  SCE 
were  tlamaged  in  varying  degrees,  including  the  S\'l- 
mar  Sw  itching  Station  just  north  of  the  Svlmar  Con- 
verter Station  where  all  of  the  live  tank  air  circuit 
breakers  w  ere  damaged.

including  sxiichronous  condensers,  transformers, 
switches,  lightning  arrcstors,  and  two  air-blast  circuit 
breakers. 

Distribution  Systems 

Some  285  small  distribution  transformers  were  so 
il;inKigcd  as  to  ha\c  to  be  replaced.  These  were  almost 
all  overhead  pole  mounted  transformers  (photo  2S). 
Thirty  wood  poles  required  replacement. 

There  were  about  240  primarv  wires  down  and 
4.^0  feeder  outages. 

All  power  to  customers  was  back  in  service  by 
February  12,  1971. 

GAS  SYSTEMS 

The  San  Fernando-Sylmar  area  is  supplied  with 
natural  gas  b\'  the  Southern  California  Gas  Companw 
Pacific  Lighting  Service  Companx ,  an  affiliate,  operates 
transmission  lines  in  the  San  Fernando-Sximar  area  as 
w  ell  as  throughout  most  of  southern  California. 

Transmission  Systems 

A  portion  of  the  transmission  s\-stem,  handling 
the  deliveries  of  California  gas  from  San  Joaquin  \'al- 
le\  south  to  the  Los  .•\ngeles  Basin,  was  damaged  to 
the  extent  that  four  welded-steel  lines  had  to  be  shut 
down  in  the  San  Fernando  area.  Damage  to  the  four 
12-  to  26-inch  lines  occurred  between  Newhall  and 
San  Fernando  and  resulted  in  the  loss  of  gas  supply 
in  the  San  Fernando-S\lmar  area. 

The  greatest  damage  was  sustained  b\'  a  16-inch 
transmission  line  in  Foothill  Boulevard  and  Glenoaks 
Boulevard.  In  this  6-mile  length  of  pipeline,  there  were 
52  separate  breaks  (photo  29).  Five  miles  of  a  12-inch 
transmission  line  have  been  abandoned  between  Sylmar 
and  San  Fernando  due  to  numerous  breaks.  Nine  breaks 
occurred  in  a  one-mile  length  of  a  26-inch  transmission 
line  in  the  Svlniar  area.  Over  all,  a  total  of  68  trans- 
mi.ssion-line  breaks  were  repaired  in  restoring  service. 
Control  of  gas  flow  ing  through  the  area  A\as  accom- 
plished by  closing  main-line  valves  on  the  affected 
pipelines  except  for  one  break  where  the  leakage  was 
monitored  but  allowed  to  continue  to  prevent  addi- 
tional customer  outages.  Continuation  of  suppl\'  to  the 
Los  .Xngelcs  Basin  area  was  also  aided  b\  an  eight-hour 
curtailment  of  large  steam-plant  loads  in  the  San  Fer- 
nando \'alle\'  area. 

Distribution  Systems 

Ihe  gas-distribution  pipe  system  was  seriousix' 
damaged  within  an  1  l-to-12-square-mile  area  in  the 
northeast  section  of  San  Fernando  \'alle\  including 
Sylmar  and  the  city  of  San  Fernando.  This  triangular 
area  is  bounded  on  the  west  by  the  Golden  State 
Freewa\ ,  on  the  south  by  the  Pacoima  Wash,  and  on 
the  north  b\-  the  San  Gabriel  .Mountains.  The  distri- 
bution facilities  w  ithin  this  area  w  ere  supplied  mostI&gt;'.

Suppl&gt;'  was  lost  to  eight  distribution  regulator  stations 
supplying  some  17,000  customers. 

6nl\-  two  or  three  fires  occurred  in  the  streets  at 
broken  gas  lines.  Fire  damage  to  structures  due  to  gas 
leakage  \\as  minor. 

The  distribution  system  in  the  hard-hit  area  con- 
sists principally  of  2-,  3-,  and  4-inch  welded-steel  mains 
and  '/^-inch  ^\  elded-steel  service  lines.  Service  was  gen- 
crallv  restored  in  the  hard-hit  area  bv  Februar\'  22, 
1971'. 

Damage  to  gas  lines  was  caused  principally  by 
permanent  ground  movement.  The  areal  pattern  of 
breaks  was  generallv  consistent  with  that  for  other 
t\'pes  of  underground  conduits. 

OIL  AND  GASOLINE  FACIUmS 

A  4-inch  and  an  8-inch  crude-oil  line  were  sep- 
arated in  the  zone  of  faulting  in  the  Sylmar  area.  There 
w  ere  a  few  minor  leaks  and  floating-roof  dislocations 
in  storage  tanks,  but  no  leaks  in  underground  distri- 
bution tanks  were  evident.  Several  service  stations  were 
structurall\'  damaged,  but  none  collapsed.  Refineries 
had  very  minor  damage,  and  some  wells  increased 
tiicir  productivity. 

This  industry  has  been  working  on  improvements 
in  nntiscismic  design  standards  since   1933. 

COMMUNICATION  SYSTEMS 

("ommunications  systems  include  telephone,  radio, 
amateur  radio,  and  television  facilities.  The  w  orst  dam- 


age was  to  poorI\'  anchored  telephone-switching  equip- 
ment. Damage  to  modern  tclcpiionc  buildings  and  other 
communication  facilities  and  equipment  was  minor. 
However,  there  were  interruptions  of  service  due  to 
power-supply  outages. 

Telephone 

The  area  aff^ected  by  this  earthquake  is  served  by 
the  Pacific  and  The  General  Telephone  Companies. 
The  General  Telephone  Compan\'  sustained  the  worst 
damage  at  their  Sylmar  Central  Office.  Ninet&gt;'-five 
percent  of  the  automatic  switching  equipment  was 
buckled  or  bent,  lying  on  the  floor  or  against  adjacent 
frames  and/or  walls  (photo  30).  This  damage  was 
caused  b&gt;'  the  heav\-  shaking  and  inadequate  anchorage 
of  the  equipment  to  the  building. 

To  speed  repairs,  the  damaged  equipment  was  re- 
moved completely  from  the  building  (photo  31). 

Damage  to  this  facility  affected  9500  customers. 
Ser\ice  was  restored  by  iMarch  19,  1971,  about  5  weeks 
after  the  earthquake. 

There  was  minor  damage  to  telephone  equipment 
at  other  locations  such  as  the  Newhall  Central  Oflice 
where  flooding  due  to  a  ruptured  water  main  caused 
a  temporary  shutdown. 

Alodern  buildings  housing  telephone  facilities  gen- 
erallx'  sustained  only  minor  damage.  Older  non-eartii- 
quake-resistant  telephone  structures  were  moderately 
damaged. 

Overloading  of  telephone  circuits  caused  partial 
breakdown  of  the  Los  Angeles  system. 

Telephone  companies  have  been  aware  of  poten- 
tial earthquake-damage  to  equipment  for  man&gt;'  years. 
The\-  have  adopted  criteria  and  de\eloped  details  for 
anchorage  and  bracing  of  equipment.  Evidently  some 
of  the  criteria  and  details  require  improvement  in  de- 
sign and  installation. 

Radio  and  Television 

Power  failure  to  receivers  caused  communication 
blackouts  in  the  heavily  damaged  area,  except  via  bat- 
ter\-operated  sets,  including  radios  in  automobiles.  A 
television  station  in  Rurbank  was  forced  to  use  its 
truck-mounted  auxiliary  transmitter. 

Amateur  radio,  of  use  in  lieu  of  malfunctioning 
telephones,  was  not  curtailed  by  the  'quake  except 
where  electrical  power  was  out. 

SUMMARY  AND  CONCLUSIONS 

In  general,  the  "state  of  the  art"  in  utilits'  or  "life- 
line" earthquake  engineering  is  at  a  relatively  low  level 
as  compared  to  structural  building  earthquake  engi- 
neering, although  there  are  some  important  exceptions. 

This  earthquake  has  stimulated  considerable  activ- 
it&gt;'  in  the  "lifeline"  earthquake-engineering  field,  and 
significant  progress  should  result  as  this  stimulation  is 
carried  through  to  improvements  in  criteria  and  con- 
struction practices. 

The  lessons  learned  from  this  earthquake  are  not 
significantiv  different  from  those  learned  from  recent 
past  shocks.  However,  there  was  a  concentration  of

modern  utilities  in  tiic  hca\'il\-  shnken  ;irc;i  w  iiicli  pro- 
\  iiicd  ;i  good  test  of  present  practices.  The  main  lesson 
reiterated  is  that  structures  and  eijuipmcnt  must  be 
specificali\-  designed,  detailed,  and  constructed  to  resist 
strong  seismic  forces  in  order  for  them  to  escape  dam- 
age in  an  earthquake.  Poorly  designed,  detailed,  and 
constructed  facilities  are  ferreted  out  h\-  earthquakes 
and  the  "w  eak  links"  are  exposed. 

Several  conclusions  can  be  reached: 

1.  Modern  steel  water-storage  tanks  and  olil  water- 
reservoir  roof  structures  performed  poorl}-.  Old  h\- 
draulic  earth-fill  dams,  not  designed  to  resist  earthquake 
loads,  performed  poorly,  w  ith  two  experiencing  near- 
failure. 

2.  Underground  conduits  for  water,  sewage, 
storm-water,  gas  and  petroleum  w  ere  damaged,  mainl\' 


because  of  permanent  differential  ground-movements 
rather  than  due  to  \ibration.  Fffective  pre\entive  meas- 
ures in  this  fielii  will  l)e  difficult  to  de\elop.  Potential 
ground-movement  areas  should  be  identified. 

3.  Large  undergrouml  structures  such  as  the  Fin- 
ished Water  Reservoir  at  the  Joseph  Jensen  Filtration 
Plant  require  special  attention.  Apparentl\-  thc\-  act 
much  like  structures  abo\e  grade.  More  research  is 
needed,  along  with  development  of  design  criteria. 

4.  Electrical  power  eijuipmcnt  performed  poorI\'. 
l''ailures  w  ere  due  to  inadeiiuatc  anchorage  and  bracing 
and  in  some  cases  to  inade(]uare  aseismic  details  within 
the  equipment. 

5.  Communication  ccpiipnicnt  in  the  telephone  in- 
dustrv  performed  well  except  for  several  failures  due 
to  inadequate  or  poorly  detailed  and  constructed  an- 
chorages and  bracing. 


Section  4 


Disaster  Response 


CHAPTER    31 

Emergency  Operations  for  Earthquakes'^' 


Emergenc&gt;-  operations,  following  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake,  were  those  measures  and  actions  taken  by 
local  government  departments  and  agencies,  the  Amer- 
ican Red  Cross  and  nongovernmental  agencies  and 
associations  to  save  lives,  aid  the  injured,  preserve 
propert\',  mitigate  hardship  and  expedite  recovery. 

The  earthquake  provided  a  test  of  the  ability  of 
these  organizations  to  cope  with  an  emergency.  Also  it 
was  an  opportunity  to  evaluate  emergency  plans 
and  procedures.  For  these  reasons  the  Commission  re- 
viewed in  considerable  detail  the  emergency  operations 
that  were  conducted  after  the  earthquake.  The  Com- 
mission's investigation,  although  centered  on  the  actual 
conduct  of  operations,  included  study  of  the  legal 
basis  for  coordination. 

Federal  financial  assistance  was  provided  local  gov- 
ernments and  individuals  under  Public  La^\•  91-606, 
the  Disaster  Relief  Act  of  1970,  and  other  applicable 
public  laws,  but  this  category  of  assistance  was  not 
reviewed  in  detail. 

Operations,  in  general,  were  well  conducted  and 
effective,  but  every  disaster  points  the  way  to  making 
improvements  in  plans,  procedures  and  preparations 
for  such  contingencies.  The  Commission's  recommen- 
dations \\ith  respect  to  emergency  operations  are  di- 
rected to  this  end. 

LEGAL  BASIS 

The  legal  basis  in  California  for  local  government 
emergency  operations  is  the  California  Emergency 
Services  Act  of  1970. 

Local  governments  normally  enact  ordinances  pro- 
viding for  their  emergency  duties  and  functions. 

CALIFORNIA  MASTER  MUTUAL  AID  AGREEMENT 

The  basis  for  providing  mutual  aid  among  local 
governments  and  the  State  is  the  California  Master 
Mutual  Aid  Agreement.  The  signatories  thereto  agree 
to  provide  assistance  to  each  other  whenever  the  con- 
ditions of  disaster  or  of  extreme  peril  are,  or  are  likely 
to  be,  beyond  the  control  of  the  services,  personnel 
or  equipment  of  the  affected  jurisdictions. 

Only  four  local  governments  in  Los  .Angeles  County 
are  not  signatory  to  the  California  Master  Mutual  Aid 
Agreement,  but  all  four  contract  \\ith  the  County  of 
Los  Angeles  for  essential  service.  Thus,  the  County 
provides  and  receives  mutual  aid  on  their  behalf. 
Therefore,  it  may  be  assumed  that  for  practical  pur- 
poses all  local  governments  in  Los  Angeles  County  are 
signatories  to  the  agreement. 


*  Reprinted  from  Report  of  the  Los  Angeles  County  Earthquake  Comn 
sion,  San  Fernando  earthquake,  February  9,  1971. 


COORDINATION 

The  California  Emergenc\-  Services  .Act  makes  man- 
datory the  establishment  of  County  operational  areas 
for  \var  emergencies,  which  are  described  as  links  "in 
the  swstem  of  communications  and  coordination  be- 
tween the  State's  emergency  operating  centers  and  the 
operating  centers  of  the  political  subdivisions  com- 
prising the  operational  area(s)."  It  is  further  stated  in 
the  Act  that  count\'  operational  areas  ma\'  be  utilized 
in  non-war  emergencies. 

The  Los  Angeles  Countv  Operational  Area  was  or- 
ganized pursuant  to  the  Act  with  the  Sheriff  desig- 
nated as  the  individual  who  is  responsible  for  providing 
the  communications  link  indicated  and  providing  the 
necessary  operational  coordination.  The  legislative 
bodies  of  seventy-five  of  the  seventy-seven  cities  of 
Los  .Angeles  County  have  passed  resolutions  concur- 
ring with  this  arrangement. 

The  decision  to  activate  county  operational  areas, 
throughout  California,  in  non-war  emergencies  rests 
with  the  local  governments  concerned.  Currently,  no 
agreement  or  understanding  exists  among  the  local 
governments  in  Los  Angeles  County  to  activate  the 
Los  .Angeles  Count)-  Operational  Area  for  emergencies 
other  than  war  or  otherwise  to  provide  for  coordina- 
tion among  local  governments. 

Coordination  betsveen  and  among  counties  is  the 
responsibility  of  the  State.  The  California  Emergency 
Services  Act  and  the  California  Emergenc\-  Operations 
Plan  provide  for  intercounty  coordination. 


EMERGENCY  COMMUNICATIONS 

Communications  svstems  are  an  essential  element  in 
the  conduct  of  emergency  operations.  In  the  February 
9,  1971,  earthquake  land-line  communications  again 
proved  to  be  vulnerable  to  damage.  Because  of  this 
it  is  concluded  that  radio  should  be  the  primar\-  com- 
munications system  for  use  in  emergencies. 

Many  radio  s&gt;'stems  are  available  for  disaster  appli- 
cation in  Los  Angeles  Count\-,  but  primary  reliance 
is  placed  upon  those  operating  on  public-safety  chan- 
nels that  are  assigned  to  local  governments  by  the 
Federal  Communications  Commission  for  police  and 
fire  departments  and  for  general  government  use,  and 
to  nongovernmental  agencies  such  as  schools  and  pri- 
vate ambulance  companies. 

The  HE.AR  (Hospital  Emergency  Administrative 
Radio)  S\stem  received  its  start  several  years  ago  when 
the  Federal  Communications  Commission  made  several 
radio  frequencies  available  for  hospital  use.  Many  hos- 
pitals in  Los  .Angeles  County  have  installed  HE.AR 
radio   equipment  and  others  are   doing  so  as   funds

for  communications  equipment  become  available.  Re- 
cently, the  County  Board  of  Supervisors  authorized 
the  Sheriff's  Department  and  the  County  Fire  Depart- 
ment to  install  radio  equipment  operating  on  HE.'XR 
frequencies,  thus  linking  count\'  government  to  the 
system.  The  HI^.^R  S\stcm  is  an  important  contri- 
bution to  the  conduct  of  emergenc\-  operations. 

Back-up  radio  communications  are  provided  by  the 
R.'VCFS  (Radio  .\mateur  Civil  Emergency  Services) 
organization.  This  is  a  volunteer  organization  com- 
posed of  amateur  radio  operators  who  operate  their 
own  equipment,  which  includes  mobile  and  portable 
units.  The  cmcrgenc\'  potential  of  the  R.ACFS  organ- 
izations, with  hundreds  of  registered  amateur  operators 
in  Los  Angeles  Countw  is  great.  However,  the  opera- 
tors must  be  organized,  trained  and  motivated.  The 
Sheriff's  Department  has  undertaken  the  task  of  or- 
ganizing RACFS  on  a  countywide  basis  and  to  provide 
essential  training. 

However,  it  is  abundantl&gt;-  clear  that  any  radio  sys- 
tem that  is  based  partiall\'  upon  land  lines  and  rel_\"ing 
on  commercial  power  is  ver\'  vulnerable.  Emergency 
power  is  essential,  and  such  facilities  must  be  installed 
to  resist  severe  shaking  without  loss  of  function.  Re- 
dundant systems  also  should  he  considered  so  that  a 
single  case  of  damage  would  not  prevent  communi- 
cating entirely. 

.Man&gt;'  local.  State  and  Federal  radio  systems  arc 
available.  The  problem  is  to  harness  these  systems  for 
emergenc\-  use  by  providing  the  necessary  intercon- 
nect stations.  The  means  to  do  so  can  be  determined 
only  b\-  a  detailed  study  of  available  systems  and  the 
equipment  required  to  provide  linkage  bervveen  sys- 
tems. This  should  be  undertaken  and  a  countywide 
communications  plan  prepared. 

DISASTER  DECLARATIONS 

The  County  Board  of  Supervisors  declared  a  local 
emergcncv  promptly  upon  con\cning  on  the  morning 
of  Fel)ruar\-  9,  1971.  The  Chairman  of  tiie  Board  also 
contacted  the  Governor  and  recommended  that  the 
Governor  (1)  declare  a  state  of  emergenc\'  and  (2) 
recommend  to  the  President  that  he  declare  Los  An- 
geles Count\'  a  major  disaster  area.  Both  the  Governor 
and  the  President  acted  within  hours.  The  latter's 
declaration  of  Los  Angeles  County  as  a  major  disaster 
area  paved  the  way  for  substantial  Federal  assistance. 

JURISDICTIONS  INVOLVED 

Three  local  governments — the  Cit\-  of  San  Fernando, 
the  City  of  Los  .•\ngeles,  and  the  County  of  Los  An- 
geles— bore  the  brunt  of  the  San  Fernando  earthquake. 
Much  of  the  se\erc  damage  occurred  along  the  Los 
Angeles  County-City  boundary  in  the  northern  part 
of  the  San  Fernando  V^alley.  As  a  result,  there  was  an 
unusual  commingling  of  emergency  operations.  For 
example,  Olive  View  Hospital  and  San  Fernando  Ju- 
venile Hall,  both  heavily  damaged,  are  County  facili- 
ties that  are  located  in  the  Cit&gt;-  of  Los  .AngeJes.  The 
San  I'^ernando  \'ctcrans  Hospital  is  a  Federal  facilit\' 
located  in  Count}-  (unincorporated)   territory  and  is 


almost  entirely'  surrounded  by  the  Cit\'  of  Los  .Angeles. 
The  heavily  damaged  segment  of  the  State  highwa\' 
sNstem  lies  both  in  flic  Count\'  and  City  of  Los  .An- 
geles. The  San  Fernando  Dams  and  \'an  Norman  Lakes 
lie  wholly  in  the  Cit\'  of  Los  .Xngeles. 

LAW  ENFORCEMENT  OPERATIONS 

The  evacuation  of  persons  lixing  below  the  San  Fer- 
nando Dam  \\  as  handled  cffcctivel\-  by  the  Los  An- 
geles Police  Department.  In  accordance  with  plans 
previousl\-  prepared,  approximately  80,000  people  were 
evacuated  from  the  threatened  area.  It  required  four 
da&gt;s  to  drain  the  reservoir  to  a  level  safe  enough  to 
permit  the  evacuees  to  return  to  their  homes. 

Following  the  report  that  a  building  had  collapsed 
at  the  San  Fernando  \'eterans  .Administration  Hos- 
pital, Cit\'  of  Los  Angeles  Fire  and  Police  Department 
units  were  dispatched  immediatel\'  even  though  it  was 
a  Count)'  operational  responsibilitv.  The  Cit\'  units 
initiated  rescue  operations  and  continued  them  until 
an  orderK    transfer  could  be  made  to  Count\'  units. 


FIRE  AND  RESCUE  OPERATIONS 

Large  earthquakes  may  cause  destructive  Hres  as 
occurred  in  Tok\-o  in  1923  and  in  San  Francisco  in 
1906.  Some  fires  did  occur  in  San  Fernando  \'alley 
but,  fortunate!}-,  not  to  the  extent  of  a  major  threat. 
The  City  of  Los  .\ngeles  on  February  9  reported  436 
fire  calls  as  compared  to  a  Februarx'  dail\'  average  of 
sevent\-three.  There  were  actualh'  128  fires,  of  which 
two  were  major.  The  Citv  of  San  Fernando  had  only 
three  fire  calls  directl\-  attributable  to  the  earthquake 
and,  of  these,  only  one  was  a  structural  fire,  which 
was  minor.  The  County  of  Los  .Angeles  responded  to 
thirty-two  fire  calls. 

Rescue  calls  were  similarl\'  increased.  The  Cit&gt;"  of 
Los  Angeles  received  457  on  February  9  as  compared 
to  a  Februar\-  dail\-  average  of  276.  The  City  of  San 
Fernando  Fire  Department  responded  to  147  rescue 
calls  and  the  Count}-  to  six.  Fortunatel}-,  most  of  these 
were  of  a  minor  nature.  The  exception  was  the  San 
Fernando  \''eterans  Hospital,  where  round-the-clock 
heavy-rescue  operations  were  conducted  over  a  period 
of  four  days. 


HELICOPTER  RECONNAISSANCE 

The  Cit}-  of  Los  Angeles  Police  and  Fire  Depart- 
ments, the  Sheriff's  Department  and  County  Fire  De- 
partment dispatched  helicopter  reconnaissance  flights 
to  tiie  general  earthquake  area  shortly  after  the  initial 
shock.  Their  \alue  in  a  damage-surve}'  role  was  ampl}- 
demonstrated.  An  even  greater  value  w-ould  have  been 
realized  had  this  information  been  made  available  to 
other  interested  departments  and  agencies. 

BUILDING  INSPECTIONS 

The  damage  caused  to  structures  throughout  the 
eartlu]uake  area  imposed  an  immediate  and  heavy  de- 
mand for  building  inspectors.  The  City  of  Los  Angeles

diverted  practical!)-  its  entire  force  of  about  250  build- 
ing inspectors  to  the  stricken  area.  For  tlie  first  two 
weeks  this  force  worked  evenings  and  weekends  in 
addition  to  regular  working  hours.  In  the  month 
following  the  earthquake  27,160  structures  were  in- 
spected in  Los  Angeles  Cit&gt;'  territory. 

The  Count)-  Engineer  assigned  a  team  of  fort&gt;-  build- 
ing inspectors  to  survey  structures  immcdiateh-  after 
the  earthquake  occurred.  .'X.pproximatel)-  4,000  build- 
ings were  inspected  in  unincorporated  Count)-  terri- 
tory during  the  first  four  weeks  after  the  earthquake. 

The  Cit)-  of  San  Fernando,  with  onl)-  one  building 
inspector  and  one  electrical  inspector,  w-as  faced  ^\-ith 
an  inspection  task  far  exceeding  its  capabilities.  The 
State  Division  of  Housing  and  Community  Develop- 
ment w  as  contacted  and  provided  eight  inspectors  for 
four  da)'s.  The  State  Office  of  General  Services  also 
was  contacted  and  provided  two  inspectors  through 
the  Office  of  Architecture  and  Construction  for  a 
combined  time-total  of  three  man-months.  The  Cit)' 
of  San  Fernando  hired  one  additional  inspector  on  a 
temporary  basis.  In  the  weeks  following  the  earth- 
quake ever)-  one  of  the  .5,200  dwellings  in  the  City  of 
San  Fernando  was  inspected. 


TRAFFIC  DISRUPTION 

Traffic  was  seriously  disrupted  on  Interstate  5  and 
State  Highway  14,  which  are  main  traffic  arteries  to 
and  from  the  north  and  northwest.  By  early  evening 
of  Februar)'  9,  one  lane  of  traffic  was  established  in 
each  direction  on  State  Highwa)-  14;  b)*  Februar)-  19 
two  lanes  of  traffic  w-ere  established  in  each  direction 
on  Interstate  5.  Pending  emergenc)-  repair,  alternate 
routes  w-ere  established  that  passed  the  heavily  dam- 
aged area. 

In  this  particular  instance,  serious  consequences  did 
not  result  from  disruption  of  these  two  main  highways. 
However,  the  earthquake  did  demonstrate  the  vulner- 
abilit)-  of  a  metropolitan  area  that  is  heavih-  dependent 
upon  its  highway  system.  .\n  earthquake  of  greater 
magnitude  could  cause  extensive  and  prolonged  traffic 
interruption  and  isolate  large  areas  of  the  Count)^ 

RESTORATION  OF  UTILITIES 

.Ml  utilities  in  the  earthquake  area  were  disrupted. 
Restoration  of  service,  however,  was  surprisingly 
quick  considering  the  damage  sustained.  .Municipal 
water  w^as  restored  to  most  of  the  area  in  four  to  five 
days  and  to  all  areas  in  eleven  days.  Pow-er  was  re- 
stored in  two  days  to  all  parts  with  the  exception  of 
the  evacuated  area  below  San  Fernando  Dam,  which 
had  power  again  by  the  evening  of  February  12  when 
residents  were  permitted  to  return  to  their  homes. 

Gas  service  was  restored  to  most  customers  in  five 
days  and  to  the  remainder  in  eleven  days.  The  tele- 
phone system  was  back  in  service  for  R,000  customers 
in  six  days,  with  complete  restoration  of  service  in 
tw-ent)--one  da)-s.  Repair  of  sewer  lines  was  a  tedious 
and  time-consuming  task  because  of  the  difficulty  in 
locating  the  man)-  breaks;  nevertheless,  emergenc)' 
repairs  were  virtually  completed  within  rwo  weeks. 


WATER  SUPPLY 

Breaks  in  water  lines  throughout  the  disaster  area 
caused  an  acute  shortage  of  water  for  basic  needs.  A 
local  brewing  compan)-  responded  to  the  emergency 
b)-  suppl)-ing  pure  water  from  its  brewery  in  Van 
Nu)s.  Tw  ent)-eight  4,000-gallon  tanks  w  ere  delivered 
to  various  locations  filled — and  refilled — with  water 
that  had  been  boiled,  ciiilled  and  rcchlorinatcd.  .More 
than  400,000  gallons  of  water  was  distributed  during 
the  period  that  w  ater  was  in  short  supply  in  the  earth- 
quake area. 

MEDICAL  CARE 

Approximate!)-  2,400  people  sustained  earthquake- 
related  injuries,  of  which  the  great  majorit)-  were  rela- 
tively minor. 

One  of  the  most  serious  aspects  of  the  earthquake 
w-as  the  fact  that  four  hospitals — Olive  \^iew-  Hospital, 
San  Fernando  \'eterans  Hospital,  Pacoima  .Memorial 
Lutheran  Hospital  and  HoK-  Cross  Hospital — were  so 
severe!)-  damaged  that  the)'  could  no  longer  function. 
The  effect  w-as  to  remove  from  use  a  total  of  1,553 
beds,  which  necessitated  the  transfer  of  about  that 
many  patients. 

RED  CROSS 

.Ministering  to  the  needs  of  disaster  victims  was  a 
major  task.  The  American  Red  Cross  carried  most  of 
the  load.  The  Los  Angeles  Chapter  office  w-as  activated 
within  forty-five  minutes  following  the  earthquake, 
and  key  personnel  and  volunteers  were  alerted.  Within 
hours  six  Red  Cross  slickers  were  established  in  schools 
of  the  Los  Angeles  Cit)-  L^nified  School  District;  in 
the  next  few  days,  as  the  need  arose,  four  additional 
shelters  were  activated.  .\  total  of  175,000  meals  was 
served,  plus  52,000  sandwiches.  Additionally,  eight 
mobile  canteens  were  operated.  The  cost  of  the  mass- 
feeding  operations  was  about  SI 25,000.  Ten  relief  cen- 
ters w  ere  established  to  meet  the  emergency  needs  of 
people  for  such  items  as  rent,  food,  clothing,  medical 
and  nursing  care,  and  minor  household  needs. 

The  Red  Cross  assisted  over  11,000  families  at  a  cost 
in  excess  of  $1,148,000.  The  Salvation  Arm)-  and  other 
charitable  organizations  also  made  notable  contribu- 
tions to  the  relief  of  disaster  victims. 

DISASTER  ASSISTANCE  CENTERS 

The  San  Fernando  Farthqunke,  as  might  be  ex- 
pected, created  a  variet)-  of  human  needs:  food, 
clothing,  shelter,  medical  attention,  debris  removal, 
disaster  loans  and  others.  .Assistance  was  available  for 
ministering  to  all  of  tiiesc  needs  from  the  .\merican 
Red  Cross  and  \-arious  Federal  and  local  government 
agencies.  In  order  to  provide  on-the-spot  help  the 
three  jurisdictions  most  seriousl)-  involved — the  County 
and  the  cities  of  Los  Angeles  and  San  Fernando — 
acting  jointl)-,  established  assistance  centers  in  the 
stricken  area.  These  centers,  well-publicized  and  staffed 
with  representatives  of  the  xarious  disaster  relief  agen- 
cies, greatly  facilitated  rendering  of  assistance  to 
individuals.

MUTUAL  AID 

Altlimigh  this  earthquake  ranks  as  one  of  California's 
major  disasters,  recourse  to  the  provisions  of  the  Cali- 
fornia Master  Mutual  Aid  Agreement  was  limited. 
The  eniergencx'  operating  resources  of  the  Coimt\'  and 
Cit\'  of  I. OS  .\ngeles  were  not  iindul\-  extended.  The 
Cit\'  of  San  Fernando,  with  less  extensive  means  and 
lying  \\holl\'  within  the  earthquake  area,  felt  tiic  strain 
upon  its  resources  far  more  than  the  Count&gt;'  and  City 
of  Los  .-Xngcles.  Mutual  aid  was  pro\ided  primarily  by 
the  State  in  assigning  building  inspectors  to  the  area. 

Assistance  from  other  jurisdictions  was  available  and 
would  ha\c  been  provided  promprl\'  upon  request.  In 
the  hours  that  followed  the  earthquake  assistance  was 
offered  b\'  unaffected  local  governments  both  from 
within  and  without  Los  Angeles  County. 

NEED  FOR  BETTER  TEAMWORK 

The  Commission's  review  of  operations,  conducted 
by  local  government  departments  following  the  earth- 
quake, revealed  certain  weaknesses.  These  did  not 
seriously  impair  the  performance  of  the  various  gov- 
ernmental agencies  involved  in  this  particular  event 
because  operational  requirements  were  w  ell  within  the 
capabilities  of  local  agencies.  However,  in  a  disaster 
of  greater  proportions  the  inadequacies  noted  would 
have  been  magnified  and  would  have  resulted  in  wasted 
motion  and  uneconomical  utilization  of  available  re- 
sources, and  could  have  caused  a  chaotic  situation. 

Most  apparent  was  the  fact  that  the  local,  State  and 
Federal  agencies  that  were  involved  conducted  their 
emergcncx"  activities  independently  of  each  other  at  a 
time  when  team  effort  or  coordination  would  have 
been  mutualK'  helpful.  This  was  evidenced  by  the  al- 
most total  lack  of  communication  among  the  agencies. 
Some  agencies  received  reports  from  the  field,  mostly 
from  mobile  units,  w  ithin  minutes  after  the  earthquake 
occurred.  Other  agencies  dispatched  helicopters  to 
ascertain  the  extent  of  damage.  Information  obtained 
from  these  sources  was  not  passed  to  other  agencies 
of  the  same  jurisdiction  or  to  interested  agencies  of 
other  jurisdictions.  The  result  w  as  that  information  of 
the  full  extent  of  the  disaster  was  slow  to  reach  some 
responsible  agenc\'  heads. 

The  situation  at  the  San  Fernando  Veterans  Hospital 
was  not  known  until  7:2  3  a.m.,  when  Cit\"  of  Los 
,\ngeles  Fire  Department  personnel  on  a  helicopter 
reconnaissance  flight  spotted  the  hca\\-  damage.  L^nits 
of  the  Cit\-  of  Los  Angeles  Fire  Department  were  dis- 
patched promptl\-  to  the  scene.  The  Count\-  Fire  De- 
partment, w  hich  has  responsibilit&gt;'  for  fire-fighting  and 
rescue  operations  in  this  unincorporated  area,  did  not 
become  aware  of  the  situation  until  9:05  a.m.,  and  the 
Sheriff's  Department  was  not  informed  of  it  until  10:30 
a.m. 

The  District  Engineer  of  the  United  States  Arm&gt;- 
Corps  of  Engineers  reported  that  his  emergency  op- 
crating  center  was  opened  shortl\-  after  7  a.m.,  Febru- 
ary 9,  and  that  he  arrived  there  at  7:15  a.m.  About 
7:45  a.m.  he  witnessed,  on  commercial  television,  the 
damage  to  the  San  Fernando  Veterans  Administration 
Hospital  and  proceeded  there  by  helicopter,  arriving 


shortl\'  after  9  a.m.  He  stressed  to  the  Commission  the 
need  for  a  tie-in  between  the  Federal  radio  network 
and  local  police  and  fire  department  networks. 

The  general  manager  of  the  Department  of  Building 
and  Safet\',  Cit\'  of  Los  .Angeles,  reported  that  his  de- 
partment was  not  able  to  ascertain  the  areas  of  heaviest 
damage  until  midaftcrnoon.  He  stressed  the  need  for 
a  central  fact-finding  center  in  such  situations. 

The  State  Division  of  Highways  district  office  in 
Los  Angeles  received  reports  of  severe  damage  to  the 
State  highwax'  system  w  ithin  a  few  minutes  after  the 
event  as  did  the  Los  .\ngelcs  Zone  \'  office  of  the 
California  Highwa\'  Patrol.  F,mergenc\-  traffic-control 
measures  were  initiated  promptly. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

\Vithin  the  current  state  of  scientific  knowledge,  it 
is  not  possible  to  predict  the  time  of  occurrence,  the        I 
location  or  the  strength  of  future  earthquakes.  How-       \ 
ever,  on  the  basis  of  past  experience,  strong  shaking        I 
can  be  expected  throughout  the  metropolitan  Los  An- 
geles area  in  the  future  as  in  the  past.  Therefore,  it  is 
most  important  that  the  experience  gained  from  the 
San  Fernando  earthquake  be  translated  into  usable  and 
effective  plans  and  measures  for  future  earthquakes. 
I  he  Commission  belic\es  that  the  implementation  of        , 
the  follow  ing  recommendations  will  improve  substan-        I 
tiall\'  the  ability  of  jurisdictions  in  Los  Angeles  Count\' 
to  cope  with  a  major  earthquake  disaster. 

Local  governments  should  establish  emergency  op- 
erating centers  for  the  collection  and  dissemination  of 
information  and  for  the  direction  and  coordination  of 
cmergenc\'  operations  in  the  event  of  a  major  disaster. 
Integral  to  the  emergencx'  operating  centers  should  be 
adequate  communications,  including  interconnect  sta- 
tions to  ensure  cmcrgenc\'  utilization  of  all  major  com- 
munications systems  M'ithin  the  jurisdiction. 

Local-government  communications  s\"stems  should 
not  be  dependent  solel\'  upon  land  lines  and  commer- 
cial power.  Communications  s\stems  and  emergency 
power  installations  should  be  designed  and  constructed 
so  that  the\'  can  survive  ver\-  strong  shaking  without 
loss  of  function. 

Local-government  officials  should  evaluate  and  up- 
date their  plans,  procedures  and  preparedness  measures 
for  coping  with  the  effects  of  damaging  earthquakes 
in  the  light  of  the  experience  derived  from  the  Feb-     ■ 
ruary  9,  1971,  event.  ■ 

Particular  attention  should  be  given  to:    (1)  estab-    T 
lishing  plans  for  coping  with  major  conflagrations  co- 
incident with  widespread   disruption   of  the    normal 
water  suppK'  and  adverse  meteorological  conditions  as     I 
ma&gt;-  occur  following  a  major  earthquake;  (2)  the  uti-     I 
lization  of  helicopters  and  fixed-wing  aircraft  for  dis-      • 
aster  reconnaissance  and  for  the  prompt  dissemination 
of  emergenc\'  information  obtained  therefrom  to  in- 
terested agencies;   (3)   the  training  of  personnel   for 
heavy-rescue  operations;  (4)  the  conducting  of  peri- 
odic carthc]uakc  exercises  for  training  of  staff  person- 
nel; (5)  preparing  plans  for  meeting  a  heavy  demand 
for  building  inspectors  to  inspect  damaged  structures; 
(6)   preparing  plans  for  the  evacuation  of  hospitals,

penal  and  correctional  institutions;  (7)  providing  the 
means  of  supplying  and  distributing  potable  water 
when  the  normal  water  supply  is  disrupted;  (8)  pre- 
paring detailed  plans  for  the  establishing  of  disaster 
assistance  centers  to  serve  individuals  in  need  of  help, 
and  (9)  the  preparation  of  contingency  plans  for  the 
rapid  evacuation  of  persons  living  below  dams. 

County  and  city  governments  in  Los  Angeles  County 
should  take  steps  to  provide  for  the  activation  of  the 
Los  Angeles  County  Operational  Area  organization  for 
major  non-war  disasters  when  the  situation  indicates 
that  interjurisdictional  coordination  of  emergency  op- 
erations is  advisable. 

The  County  of  Los  Angeles,  having  responsibility 
for  countywide  coordination  of  emergency  operations 
in  war  emergencies  and  as  agreed  upon  for  non-war 


emergencies,  should  establish  an  emergency  operating 
center  to  function  on  a  countywide  as  well  as  jurisdic- 
tional basis.  This  center  must  have  radio  links  to  key 
local.  State  and  Federal  radio  systems.  The  nucleus  of 
the  emergency  operating  center  should  be  operational 
on  a  day-to-day  basis  and  he  capable  of  being  expanded 
quickly  to  full-scale  operations  following  the  onset  of 
major  disasters. 

A  study  of  the  communications  systems  in  Los  An- 
geles County  that  would  be  available  for  emergency 
utilization  should  be  undertaken  with  the  object  of 
determining  communications  deficiencies.  A  county- 
wide  communications  plan  also  should  be  prepared. 

A  count&gt;'\\ide  emergency  transportation  plan  should 
be  established  to  ensure  movement  of  essential  supplies, 
equipment  and  personnel  to  areas  of  need  in  Los 
Angeles  County  when  normal  routes  are  disrupted. 


CHAPTER  32 

Disaster  Response-Assistance  to  Individuals^ 

by  Frederic  I.  Ross  ' 


6:00:40  a.m.,  February  9,  1971— Thousands  of 
Los  Angeles  Basin  citizens  were  rudely  awakened  to 
"disaster".  Within  minutes,  emergency  agencies  were 
in  action,  massing  and  deploying  resources  to  relieve 
the  human  misery  that  inevitably  must  follow. 

By  6:40  a.m.,  Los  Angeles  Police  Department 
command  posts  were  strategically  located  throughout 
the  city's  affected  area,  making  situational  reports  to 
the  Police  Department's  Central  Emergency  Control 
Center,  which  was  functioning  by  6:30  a.m.  These 
operations  began  in  accordance  with  a  well-developed 
LAPD  emergency  plan. 

By  7:00  a.m.,  the  Control  Center  had  developed 
a  fairly  composite  assessment  of  the  over-all  emer- 
gency situation  within  the  city.  Of  top  priorit)^  was  a 
possible  threat  to  80,000  persons  living  below  San 
Fernando  Dam.  Acting  on  a  Los  Angeles  Department 
of  Water  and  Power  report  of  potential  dam  failure, 
received  shortly  after  7  a.m.,  the  LAPD  put  into  effect 
a  planned  evacuation  operation.  Evacuation  area  pe- 
rimeters \vere  established  from  maps  which  had  been 
prepared  in  anticipation  of  such  need.  By  7:30  a.m., 
LAPD  field  commanders  had  begun  evacuation  oper- 
ations. 

Almost  immediately,  on  notification  of  potential 
dam  failure,  the  LAPD  advised  an  already-girding 
local  American  National  Red  Cross  (ANRC)  Chapter 
of  a  need  for  shelters  to  receive  evacuees. 

A  few  minutes  after  8  a.m.,  the  first  Red  Cross 
shelter  was  in  operation.  By  9:10  a.m.,  four  more 
centers  were  open  and  providing  for  the  first  few 
hundred  confused  and  dazed  evacuees,  whose  numbers 
would,  before  the  night,  swell  to  over  6000. 

The  Red  Cross  response  was  one  of  professionally 
planned  precision.  By  previous  arrangement  with 
school  districts,  specified  schools,  on  notification  from 
the  Red  Cross,  were  opened  as  shelters.  Professional 
and  volunteer  Red  Cross  personnel  and  members  of 
the  Los  Angeles  County  Department  of  Public  Social 
Services  speedily  moved  into  the  designated  shelters 
and  systematically  put  tried  and  tested  emergency 
procedures  into  effect.  Food  stores  were  laid  in;  cots 
and  bedding  were  provided;  medical  facilities  were 
set  up;  and  arrangements  were  made  for  satisfaction  of 
other  personal  needs  as  they  arose. 

Through  the  ensuing  week,  the  Red  Cross 
moved  quickly  to  establish  or  participate  in  assistance 
centers  as  new  geographical  areas  of  need  became 
apparent.

^  Manuscript  submitted  for  publication  June  30,  1971. 
'At  time  of  earthqualse,   State  Office  of  Emergency   Services, 
Sacramento. 


Before  8  a.m.  of  February  9,  1971,  the  Los  An- 
geles Area  (U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture)  Food 
and  Nutrition  representative  had  informed  the  Red 
Cross  of  surplus  food  warehouse  locations  and,  under 
singular  statutory  authority,  approved  emergency  use 
of  the  food  stores. 

Within  30  minutes  of  the  first  temblor,  Gardner 
Davis,  Office  of  Emergency  Services  Field  Represen- 
tative, had  activated  the  Region  I  Emergency  Opera- 
tions Center  and  established  contact  with  the  Los 
Angeles  Police  Department,  the  Los  Angeles  Count&gt;' 
Sheriff's  Office,  and  other  emergency  response  agen- 
cies. As  information  became  available  to  the  Region  I 
office,  it  was  relayed  to  the  Sacramento  Office  of 
Emergency  Services. 

From  6  a.m.  until  8:30  a.m.,  reports  were  disarm- 
ingly  void  of  significant  havoc.  There  were  reports  of 
a  damaged  but  apparently  safe  San  Fernando  Dam, 
of  broken  glass,  scattered  fires,  and  ruptured  gas,  elec- 
tric, and  water  lines;  but  most  situations  appeared 
under  control.  Then,  in  the  ensuing  hour,  the  spectre 
of  disaster  became  manifest.  News  of  casualties  under 
broken  buildings  at  the  Olive  View  Hospital  was  fol- 
lowed shortly  by  word  of  a  devastated  Veterans  Ad- 
ministration Hospital.  Then  came  varying  reports  of 
imminent  dam  rupture,  of  collapsed  highway  over- 
passes, and  of  extensive  private  home  damage.  San 
Fernando  City  broke  an  almost  3-hour  silence  with  an 
urgent  plea  for  assistance.* 

At  the  Office  of  Emergency  Ser\nces  in  Sacra- 
mento, an  almost  routine  morning  erupted  into  posi- 
tive action.  Intelligence  was  consolidated  from  tele- 
phone, television,  teletype,  and  radio  reports.  Facts, 
figures,  and  status  of  casualties  and  destruction  were 
compiled  and  rushed  by  Deputy  Director  R.  Dale 
DeStaffany  to  the  Office  of  the  Governor,  where  the 
Chief  Executive  evaluated  the  situation  and  by  10:30 
a.m.,  had  proclaimed  a  "state  of  emergency"  in  Los 
Angeles  County  and  directed  full  State  agency  par- 
ticipation in  mitigation  and  recover)'  operations. 

The  Governor  then  relayed  a  request  to  the  Presi- 
dent of  the  United  States  for  Federal  assistance.  By 
1:30  p.m.,  the  President  had  declared  a  "major  dis- 
aster" in  the  affected  area  and  directed  the  full  appli- 
cation of  Federal  resources  to  supplement  State  and 
local  disaster  response. 

*Xotable  among  agencies  providing  desperately  needed  drinking 
water  to  San  Fernando  City  and  other  affected  areas  were 
Jos.  Schliti!  Brewing  Co.  and  Arrowhead  Puritas  Water. 
These  companies  delivered  and  strategically  situated  327,000 
gallons  and  over  .")0,000  gallons  of  pure  water,  respectively. 
Sparklets  and  Coca  Cola  also  provided  water,  but  the 
quantities  are  not  known.  The  California  National  Guard 
provided  and  maintained  33  600-gallon  trailers  of  drinking 
water  at  affected  schools.

Even  prior  to  the  Governor's  proclamation,  key 
representatives  from  various  State  agencies  began  to 
assemble  at  the  Region  I  EOC.  Geological  field  in- 
vestigations by  the  State  Division  of  Mines  and  Ge- 
ology had  begun  by  8:00  a.m.  By  1 1  a.m.,  the  Division 
of  Highways,  Department  of  Water  Resources,  Office 
of  Architecture  and  Construction,  Military  Depart- 
ment, Department  of  Justice,  Highway  Patrol,  Depart- 
ment of  Public  Health,  and  the  Department  of  Hous- 
ing and  Communit&gt;-  Development  were  represented 
atthe  EOC.  Almost  simultaneously,  the  Federal  Office 
of  Emergency  Preparedness,  in  anticipation  of  a 
Presidential  Declaration,  activated  a  field  office  within 
the  Region  I  EOC. 

At  approximately  2  p.m.,  the  Governor  was  in 
Los  Angeles  receiving  a  briefing  from  Michael  Colby, 
Office  of  Emergency  Services  Regional  Manager,  and 
representatives  from  other  State  and  local  agencies. 
Within  three  hours  thereafter,  John  McCoy,  OES 
Director,  and  Gordon  Larkin,  State  Coordinating 
Officer,  were  on  their  way  to  the  disaster  area. 

On  the  morning  of  February  10,  1971,  represen- 
tatives from  Federal,  State,  and  local  agencies  joined 
with  the  Federal  and  State  coordinating  officers  to 
map  a  plan  of  cooperative  emergency  action. 

Of  primary  concern  was  the  prompt  relief  of 
human  suffering  and  reduction  of  hazard.  All  day  of 
the  tenth  was  occupied  with  these  immediate  objec- 
tives. On  the  eleventh  of  February,  attention  was  di- 
rected to  providing  the  affected  populace  with  post- 
emergency  assistance.  This  included  temporary 
housing,  loans  for  home  repair  and  replacement,  and 
unemployment  benefits. 

The  Federal  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban 
Development  (HUD)  was  designated  by  OEP  to 
provide  temporary  housing  and  rent  and  mortgage- 
payment  assistance  to  disaster  victims.  It  was  deter- 
mined that  HUD  would  make  its  resources  available 
through  the  Los  Angeles  City  Housing  Authority  and 
the  Los  Angeles  County  Urban  Affairs  Department, 
respectively. 

Under  the  Federal  Disaster  Relief  Act,  a  home- 
owner whose  home  was  made  unhabitable  by  the 
earthquake  was  authorized  up  to  a  year's  free  rental 
in  suitable  temporary  housing.  A  person  renting  a 
home  that  was  made  unhabitable  by  the  earthquake 
was  provided  the  same  service  if  his  over-all  cost  of 
living  was  increased  significanth-  through  having  to 
change  residence.  HUD  was  also  authorized  to  assume 
either  rent  or  mortgage  payments  for  up  to  12  months 
for  those  persons  with  notice  of  eviction  or  fore- 
closure who  were  unable  to  meet  payments  because 
of  earthquake-induced  financial  hardship. 

Financial  assistance  for  repair  and  replacement  of 
homes,  furniture,  and  other  designated  personal  effects 
was  provided  by  the  Federal  Small  Business  Adminis- 
tration (SB.\)  in  the  form  of  low  interest  long-term 
loans.  These  loans  were  made  available  to  qualified 
applicants  at  a  SVs   percent  interest  rate,*  a  30-year

term,  and  with  a  $2500  forgiveness  feature.  Under  the 
forgiveness  clause,  after  the  first  S500  of  a  loan  is 
repaid,  the  remainder  of  the  amount  ow'ed  is  reduced 
by  as  much  as  $2500.  Thus,  if  a  person  borrows  $5000, 
he  has,  after  repaying  $500  of  the  amount,  only  $2000 
remaining  to  pay.  On  these  terms,  an  individual  could 
borrow  up  to  $50,000  for  repair  or  replacement  of  his 
disaster-damaged  home.  A  person  could  also  borrow 
up  to  $10,000  under  the  same  terms  for  repair  or  re- 
placement of  personal  property  damaged  or  lost  in  the 
quake.  However,  the  sum  of  a  home  loan  and  a  per- 
sonal property  loan  to  the  same  individual  cannot  ex- 
ceed $55,000. 

Such  loans  may,  however,  only  apply  to  losses, 
or  parts  of  losses,  w'hich  are  not  covered  by  insurance 
or  other  means.  Thus,  if  half  of  a  $10,000  loss  were 
covered  by  insurance  or,  perhaps,  by  a  Red  Cross 
grant,  then  the  borrower  could  only  get  an  SBA  loan 
for  the  remaining  $5000. 

The  SBA  may  also  defer  payment  of  principal 
and/or  interest  on  such  loans,  if  such  deferment  is 
requested  within  the  first  three  years  of  the  loan  term. 
In  the  San  Fernando  Valley  disaster,  a  5-month  de- 
ferral of  both  principal  and  interest  was  automatically 
granted.  A  disaster-damaged  home  could  also  be  re- 
financed for  up  to  the  same  amount  and  under  the 
same  terms  as  for  a  new  loan,  except  that  to  be  eligible, 
damage  to  the  home  must  exceed  50  percent  of  its 
fair  market  value.

interest  existing  loans  made  or  insured  by  them.  FHA 
could  also  suspend  payments  of  interest  and/or  princi- 
pal for  up  to  five  years  on  loans  they  insured.  FAHA 
may  extend  the  term  of  a  refinanced  FAHA  loan  up 
to  40  years.  As  with  the  SBA,  the  FAHA  may  also 
forgive  up  to  |2500  on  any  disaster  loan  they  make 
under  PL  91-606,  and  they  may  defer  payment  of 
principal  and/or  interest  if  a  request  for  such  defer- 
ment is  made  within  the  first  three  years  of  the  loan 
term.  As  of  June  25,  1971,  there  were  no  known  ap- 
plicants for  FHA  or  FAHA  refinancing  or  payment 
suspension. 

The  U.S.  Veterans  Administration  has  authority 
to  excuse  part  or  all  of  a  VA-insured  mortgage  on 
property  damaged  or  destroyed  by  a  disaster.  This 
authority-,  which  is  exercised  on  an  individual  basis, 
may  apply  to  a  house  being  purchased  under  veterans' 
entitlement  or  to  an  administrator-acquired  house  (re- 
possession) used  as  security  for  a  VA  loan.  As  of 
June  25,  1971,  the  VA  had  excused  the  remaining 
debt  on  three  "repossessions"  that  were  destroyed  by 
the  quake. 

The  California  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs 
(DVA),  under  Article  3.7,  Section  989  of  the  Military 
and  Veterans  Code,  is  authorized  to  indemnify  disaster- 
incurred  home  losses  suffered  by  persons  purchasing 
homes  under  the  Cal-Vet  program.  In  the  San  Fer- 
nando Valley  disaster,  the  Department  of  Veterans 
Affairs  filed  over  600  claims  under  the  above  section; 
and  they  estimated  a  total  disbursement  of  1500,000 
will  result  from  these  claims. 

On  the  scene  to  provide  unemployment  compen- 
sation for  those  whose  employment  was  curtailed  as 
a  result  of  the  temblor  was  the  California  Department 
of  Human  Resources  Development  (HRD).  They  not 
only  processed  claims  under  State  law,  but  adminis- 
tered the  Federal  program  of  the  U.S.  Secretary  of 
Labor.  The  Federal  program  provided  assistance  to 
individuals  rendered  unemployed  by  the  quake  but 
who  were  ineligible  for  State  unemployment  benefits. 
State  benefits  range  from  $50  to  $65  per  week  for 
26  weeks  (and  longer  under  certain  circumstances). 
Federal  benefits  came  to  $55  a  week  for  the  same  time 
period.  Of  the  latter,  HRD  processed  over  4500  claims. 
The  number  of  claims  processed  wholly  under  the 
State  program  could  not  be  ascertained  because  dis- 
aster claims  were  indistinguishable  from  those  rou- 
tinely processed. 

Time  and  regulatory  gaps  in  government  assist- 
ance were  effectively  filled  by  the  Red  Cross,  with 
total  outlay  of  approximately  $  1  Vi  million,  broken 
down  in  the  following  areas:

As  a  hypothetical  case  in  assistance  to  a  home 
owner,  let  us  assume  an  individual  was  purchasing  a 
$25,000  home  (including  $5000  raw  land  value)  which 
sustained  $15,000  (75  percent)  damage  from  the  earth- 
quake and  is  now  unhabitable.  Here  is  a  man  and  his 
wife,  their  house  broken  and  askew  on  its  foundation, 
their  children  hungry  and  crying,  perhaps  one  or  more 
of  them  suffering  injury — What  are  they  to  do?  Where 
are  they  to  go? 

The  first  move  is  to  the  Red  Cross,  which  is  nor- 
mally the  first  on  the  scene  with  emergency  shelter, 
food,  clothing,  medical  aid,  and  counselling.  After 
seeing  to  the  family's  immediate  needs,  the  Red  Cross 
counsellor  will  assess  the  family's  straits  and  refer  the 
homeowner  to  the  appropriate  government  agency  or 
agencies  for  recovery  assistance.  If  needed  assistance 
is  not  reasonably  available  from  other  agencies,  the 
ANRC  may  provide  it  from  its  resources. 

In  this  instance,  it's  probable  that  the  Red  Cross 
is  located  in  one  of  six  assistance  centers,  set  up  to 
provide  easy  access  to  a  broad  grouping  of  assistance 
agencies.  Other  agencies  represented  in  the  centers 
may  include  HUD,  SBA,  HRD,  and  other  Federal, 
State,  and  local  offices  which  may  have  resources 
available  for  individual  assistance.  Such  centers  were 
conceived  as  a  single  convenient  point  to  provide  dis- 
aster victims  with  as  immediate  and  complete  recovery 
assistance  as  reasonably  possible.  Thus,  our  hypotheti- 
cal case  is  simply  referred  to  another  desk  within  the 
same  building. 

First,  he  must  find  temporary  housing  while  ar- 
ranging financing  and  awaiting  repair  of  his  home.  For 
this,  he  will  be  referred  to  the  local  agency  administer- 
ing the  HUD  temporary  housing  and  assistance  pro- 
gram. In  the  San  Fernando  earthquake,  these  were 
the  Los  Angeles  Housing  Authorit&gt;'  representing  the 
Cit&gt;-  and  the  Urban  Affairs  Department  representing 
Los  Angeles  County.  Here,  with  minimal  processing, 
he  will  be  provided,  rent-free  for  up  to  12  months,  a 
temporary  home  of  proper  size  and  qualit}'  to  house 
the  family.   He  has  the  option  of  selecting  a  home

from  available  listings  or  going  out  on  his  own  and 
finding  a  home  which  meets  the  prescribed  standards 
and  price  ceiling. 

After  arranging  temporary  housing,  he  must  now 
tackle  financial  arrangements  for  satisfying  his  origi- 
nal mortgage  and  effecting  necessary  repairs  to  his 
damaged  home. 

Let  us  assume  he  had  a  110,000  equity  in  the 
home,  with  his  loan  being  paid  off  at  7  percent  interest 
rate,  over  a  30-}ear  term.  Thus,  he  is  not  only  faced 
with  a  $15,000  repair  cost,  but  a  loan  balance  of 
$15,000,  with  monthly  payments  of  $222  (including 
ta.xes  and  insurance).  Under  these  circumstances,  he 
could  refinance  his  original  loan  and  gain  a  new  loan 
for  home  repair,  both  at  5'/^  prccent  interest;  and, 
since  his  home  damage  \\as  in  excess  of  50  percent  of 
fair  value,  he  could  obtain  both  loans,  and  consolidate 
them,  through  the  Small  Business  Administration.  If 
damage  had  been  less  than  50  percent  of  fair  value, 
and  his  home  loan  insured  by  either  FHA  or  FAHA, 
he  could  still  have  had  his  original  loan  refinanced 
through  these  agencies. 

Now,  a  combined  loan  of  $30,000  (less  $2,500 
forgiveness)  at  5'/8  percent  interest  rate  would  result 
in  monthly  pa&gt;-mcnts  of  $206,  sixteen  dollars  less  than 
his  original  payments,  but  with  another  full  30  years 
for  repayment.  No\\',  let's  make  his  situation  even 
worse.  Let's  assume  that  his  wife's  job  and  resulting 
supplemental  income  \\erc  eliminated  because  of  the 
quake.  He  nou-  finds  the  total  famih-  net  income  is 
not  sufficient  for  him  to  qualify  for  the  needed  loan. 
His  net  income  now  will  qualify-  him  for  only  a 
$20,000  loan.  At  this  point,  let's  say  that  he  is  able  to 


provide  $2,500  from  personal  resources  to  reduce  the 
loan  need  to  $25,000 — still  beyond  his  means;  and 
worse  yet,  he  has  received  notice  of  foreclosure  on  his 
original  loan.  Here,  he  can  return  to  HUD,  who  may, 
under  such  circumstances,  make  his  mortgage  pay- 
ments for  him  for  up  to  12  months.  Then,  he  can  turn 
again  to  the  Red  Cross,  who  may  provide  the  home- 
owner with  an  outright  grant  of  the  $5,000  needed  to 
qualify  him  for  the  SBA  loan.  He  now  negotiates  a 
$20,0()0  loan,  with  monthly  payments  of  only  $164. 
If  his  circumstances  are  relatively  insecure  and  he 
finds  making  the  above  payments  may  incur  a  hardship 
at  this  critical  point  in  time,  the  SBA  may  defer 
monthly  payments  until  he  is  in  a  better  financial 
situation. 

Had  our  disaster  victim's  original  home  loan  been 
insured  or  made  by  the  U.S.  Veterans  Administration 
and  his  abilit\-  to  repay  significantly  impaired,  he  may 
have  had  all  or  part  of  his  loan  balance  cancelled. 
Similarly,  had  his  home  been  security  for  a  loan  made 
by  the  Y \  in  the  sale  of  administrator-acquired  prop- 
erties (repossessions),  the  indebtedness  could  also  be 
excused  on  an  individual  basis.  And,  if  he  had  been  so 
fortunate  as  to  have  acquired  his  home  under  the 
California  Department  of  Veterans  .\ffairs  "Cal-Vet" 
program,  his  home  could  have  been  repaired  or  re- 
placed at  no  cost  to  him. 

On  the  other  hand,  in  a  perhaps  less-than-ethical 
approach,  our  hypothetical  disaster  victim  could  sim- 
pl\-  default  on  his  original  loan  and  obligate  himself 
onl\-  w  ith  the  new  low-interest  loan.  This  was,  in  fact, 
the  route  taken  by  some  in  the  San  Fernando  Valley 
disaster.

San  Fernando  Earthquake — Disaster  Response 


441 


♦ 


In  the  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9, 
1971,  there  were  many  noble  and  generous  individuals 
and  agencies  who  contributed  immeasurably  to  the 
relief  and  recovery  of  stricken  citizens.  To  appro- 
priately recognize,  in  this  writing,  all  these  contribu- 
tions would  require  many  times  the  space  allowed  in 
this  bulletin.  Therefore,  except  for  necessary  "stage- 
setting"  developments,  this  article  has  been  restricted 
to  the  few  major  sources  of  recovery  assistance  to 
individuals.  The  objective  has  been  to  delineate  and 


clarify  assistance  offered  by  these  agencies  to  enlighten 
the  reader  on  advances  being  made  in  organized  and 
planned  disaster  relief. 

Assistance  provided  by  agencies  discussed  herein 
is  summarized  in  table  3,  which  contains  general  in- 
formation as  it  relates  to  the  San  Fernando  earthquake. 
For  details  concerning  eligibility,  qualifications,  limi- 
tations, and  procedures,  you  should  contact  the  pro- 
viding agency.

Minimizing  Losses 


CHAPTER  33 

Legislative  and  Adminisfrafive 

Earthquake-Protective  Measures 

by  State  Government  in  California 

by  Gordon  B.  Ookeshott '  and  Wesley  G.  Bruer  * 


HISTORY  OF  OFFICIAL  STATE  INVOLVEMENT 
The  San  Fernando  earthquake  produced  a  wealth 
of  instrumental  data,  far  more  than  ever  obtained  from 
any  previous  earthquake.  It  is  already  one  of  the  most 
thoroughly  studied  earthquakes  in  history,  and  studies 
are  continuing.  In  addition  to  the  voluminous  earth- 
science  data  generated  by  this  event,  more  information 
is  already  available  on  loss  of  life,  injuries,  and  prop- 
erty damage  than  for  any  other  American  earthquake. 
This  mass  of  data  has  advanced — and  will  continue  to 
advance — the  body  of  knowledge  in  all  fields  neces- 
sary to  reduce  losses  effectively  in  future  seismic 
events. 

Conclusions  and  recommendations  have  followed 
every  earthquake,  increasing  in  number  and  detail 
with  successive  earthquakes.  A  century  ago,  after  the 
great  Owens  Valley  earthquake  of  1872,  the  editor  of 
the  Inyo  Independeitt  concluded  that  "severe  and  ap- 
palling as  this  great  convulsion  of  the  earth  unques- 
tionably was,  it  is  a  settled  conviction  with  all  here 
that  not  a  person  would  have  been  killed  or  hurt  had 
their  houses  all  been  made  of  wood".  He  then  made 
the  recommendation  ". . .  to  forever  eschew  adobe, 
brick,  and  stone  in  buildings"  (Oakeshott  et  al.,  1972). 
The  single-stor&gt;%  wood-frame  house  has  proved  its 
worth  in  many  subsequent  earthquakes  in  California. 
(See,  for  example,  Steinbrugge  in  this  Bulletin).  After 
San  Francisco  1906,  the  California  Earthquake  Com- 
mission (Lawson  et  al.,  1908)  said:  "It  is  evident  that 
much  of  the  damage  to  houses,  as  well  as  to  their 
contents,  could  be  avoided  by  judicious  construction. 
The  disadvantages  of  certain  classes  of  structure 
should  be  acknowledged  and  search  made  for  more 
successful  styles.  Houses  practically  earthquake-proof 
can  be  built  easily  and  cheaply."  Today's  structural 
engineers  confirm  that  man-built  structures  can  be 
made  highly  earthquake-resistant  at  an  added  cost  of 
a  few  percent  of  the  total  cost  of  construction  if  earth- 
quake-resistant measures  are  incorporated  in  the  de- 
sign. 

What  is  being  done  to  reduce  earthquake  risk  in 
California?  The  San  Fernando  earthquake,  unlike  so 
many  previous  California  earthquakes,  continues  to 
receive  great  attention  from  all  levels  of  government, 
from  universities,  and  from  the  private  sector,  more 
than    two    years    after    the    event.    It    may    have

provided  the  impetus  for  efforts  which  will  lead  to  a 
truly  significant  improvement  in  seismic  safety  for  the 
citizens  of  the  state.  While  the  programs  of  other 
entities  are  no  less  important,  the  seismic  safety  ac- 
tivities of  the  State  of  California  are  the  primary  sub- 
ject of  this  report. 

Perhaps  the  first  official  evidence  of  concern  of 
the  State  of  California  about  earthquakes  was  reprinted 
in  full  in  the  8th  Annual  Report  of  the  State  Min- 
eralogist (since  1961,  again  "State  Geologist")  of 
State  Geologist  J.  D.  Whitney's  two  papers  on  the 
Owens  Valley  earthquake  of  1872,  originally  published 
in  the  Overland  Monthly  of  September  and  October 
of  1872.  It  is  interesting  that  the  earthquake  of  1872 
was  felt  in  Sacramento  and  that  the  new  capitol  was 
damaged  when  an  iron  column  was  broken. 

The  first  major  step  in  State-of-California  partici- 
pation in  earthquake  investigations  was  taken  by  Gov- 
ernor George  C.  Pardee  when,  three  days  after  the 
great  San  Francisco  earthquake  of  April  18,  1906,  he 
appointed  the  State  Earthquake  Investigation  Com- 
mission. The  Commission  was  chaired  by  Professor 
A.  C.  Lawson,  famous  Universit&gt;'  of  California  geolo- 
gist, and  manned  by  greats  of  the  time,  including  J.  C. 
Branner  of  Stanford's  Geology  Department,  G.  K. 
Gilbert  of  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey,  H.  F.  Reid, 
professor  of  geology  at  Johns  Hopkins,  and  several 
noted  astronomers.  Following  the  earthquake,  the 
Carnegie  Institution  of  Washington  published  the 
monumental  Report  of  the  State  Earthquake  Investiga- 
tion Commission*  which  remains  one  of  the  greatest 
accounts  of  an  earthquake  ever  published. 

Nineteen  thirty-three  was  a  year  of  disaster,  with 
California's  third  most  costly  earthquake  occurring  in 
the  Long  Beach  area  on  March  10.  Scandalous  struc- 
tural failure  of  dozens  of  school  buildings  caused  the 
Legislature  to  pass  the  "Field  Act".  This  Act  requires 
the  State  Office  of  Architecture  and  Construction  to 
set  up  rules  and  regulations  concerning  earthquake 
safety  in  design  and  construction  of  school  buildings. 
These  regulations  are  now  included  in  Title  21  and 
Title  24  of  the  California  Administrative  Code.  The 
law  is  not  retroactive,  so  California's  public  school 
buildings  are  now  categorized  as  approved  or  unap- 
proved. The  Act  has  been  highly  successful  in  reduc- 
ing damage  in  subsequent  earthquakes.  The  problem 
of  the  continued  use  of  the  older  tmapproved  school 
buildings  is  being  attacked  by  the  new  revision  of  the

Garrison  Act  requiring  that  such  buildings  he  brought 
up  to  earthquake-resistive  standards  by  June  30,  1975, 
or  their  use  discontinued. 

July  21,  1952,  is  a  date  to  remember  in  California 
earthquake  history.  The  major,  magnitude  7.7  Arvin- 
Tehachapi  earthquake  caused  the  loss  of  14  lives  and 
$60  million  in  property  at  the  same  time  that  it  con- 
firmed the  successful  application  of  the  Field  Act  in 
maintaining  a  low  level  of  damage  to  schools.  Cali- 
fornia Division  of  Mines  Bulletin  171,  Earthquakes  hi 
Kern  County  during  1952,  firmly  established  earth- 
quake investigation  and  publication  as  a  proper  ac- 
tivity of  the  California  Division  of  Mines  and  launched 
the  Division  on  an  accelerating  program  of  earthquake 
investigation  and  publication. 

CALIFORNIA  LEGISLATURE'S  JOINT  COMMITTEE 
ON  SEISMIC  SAFETY 

Senate  Concurrent  Resolution  No.  128 — Relating 
to  a  Joint  Committee  on  Seismic  Safety — was  filed 
with  the  Secretary  of  State  August  25,  1969.  The  Joint 
Committee  on  Seismic  Safety  thus  set  up  consists  of 
four  members  of  the  State  Senate  plus  four  members 
of  the  Assembly;  the  Committee  is  advised  by  five 
Advisory  Groups,  each  made  up  of  14  or  15  authori- 
ties in  the  field.  The  Joint  Committee  "shall  file  a  final 
report  with  the  Legislature  not  later  than  June  30, 
1974".  . . .  "The  final  report  shall  contain: 

a)  The  results  of  the  detailed  study   mode  by  the  Committee. 

b)  A  plan  for  continuous  revision  of  the  study  as  new  infor- 
mation is  obtained. 

c)  A  plan  to  minimize  the  probable  loss  of  life  and  prop- 
erty and  to  minimize  the  disruption  of  the  local  economy 
should   an   earthquake  disaster  occur. 

d)  A  plan  for  appropriate  and  effective  response  to  the  im- 
mediate   problems    arising    after    an    earthquake    disaster. 

e)  Such  other  information  and  recommendations  as  the  com- 
mittee  deems   desirable." 

The  Joint  Committee  is  chaired  by  Senator  Alfred 
E.  Alquist  of  San  Jose.  The  Committee  is  assisted  by 
five  technical  advisory  groups  in  the  fields  of  En- 
gineering Considerations  and  Earthquake  Sciences, 
Governmental  Organiration  and  Performance,  Dis- 
aster Preparedness,  Land  Use  Planning,  and  Post- 
earthquake  Recovery  and  Redevelopment.  Over  sev- 
enty of  California's  foremost  experts  in  these  fields 
contribute  their  time  and  knowledge  while  serving  on 
these  groups. 

The  first  report  of  the  Seismic  Safety  Committee 
(Legislature,  1970)  summarized  the  work  of  the  Ad- 
visory Groups  to  June  30,  1970,  including  organiza- 
tion, program  plan,  a  summary  history  of  surface 
faulting  and  moderate-to-great  earthquakes,  objectives 
and  work  schedules,  and  a  scenario  description  of 
effects  expected  in  earthquakes. 

The  Joint  Committee  held  two  hearings  during 
1970;  and  the  information  gained,  together  with  the 
extensive  background  material  developed  by  the  tech- 
nical Advisory  Groups,  enabled  legislators  of  the  Joint 
Committee  and  other  members  of  the  State  Legisla- 
ture to  propose  a  series  of  bills  related  to  earthquake 
safety. 

The  San  Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9,  1971, 
greatly    stimulated    interest    and    action    concerning 


earthquakes  and  their  effects  in  California.  On  April 
27,  1971,  enabling  legislation  (Joint  Rules  Committee 
Resolution  No.  7)  was  passed,  asking  the  Chairman 
of  the  Joint  Committee  on  Seismic  Safety  to  appoint 
a  "special  three-man  subcommittee  to  conduct  an  in- 
depth  investigation,  and  report  on  its  findings  relevant 
to  events  prior  to,  during,  and  after  the  Los  Angeles 
earthquake  of  February  9,  1971".  Complete,  in-depth 
studies  by  the  consultants  to  the  subcommittee  were 
published  in  July  1972  in  the  following  earthquake 
subject  areas:  structural  engineering,  geological  and 
-scismological  lessons,  dams  and  soils,  city  lifelines, 
land-use  planning,  disaster  preparedness,  and  govern- 
ment organization  and  performance. 

The  Joint  Committee  continues  to  promote  in- 
creased seismic  safety  through  the  channels  of  public 
information  dissemination,  public  hearings,  investiga- 
tions of  past  disasters  and  current  standards,  introduc- 
tion of  legislation,  and  development  of  new  proposed 
policies  and  programs. 

The  final  report  and  recommendations  of  the  Joint 
Committee  were  presented  to  the  Legislature  in 
1974. 

RECENT  LEGISLATION 

About  50  pieces  of  legislation  dealing  with  earth- 
quakes were  introduced  at  the  1971  session  of  the 
State  Legislature,  a  large  part  of  it  through  members 
of  the  Joint  Committee  on  Seismic  Safety.  Perhaps  the 
most  far-reaching  bills  which  were  passed  by  the 
Legislature  and  signed  into  law  by  the  Governor  were 
Senate  Bills  351  and  691.  They  require  that  all  general 
plans  of  local  government  consider,  among  other  ele- 
ments, a  seismic  safety  element  consisting  of  an  identi- 
fication and  appraisal  of  seismic  hazards.  The  Division 
of  Mines  and  Geology  received  numerous  requests 
from  local  government  for  guidelines  in  considering 
this  element.  In  response  to  the  need,  the  Governor's 
Earthquake  Council  prepared  Suggested  interim  guide- 
lines. The  Division's  work  in  the  field  of  earthquake 
investigations  and  its  County  co-operative  programs 
(see  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology  in  the  appendix 
of  this  paper)  are  furnishing  much  information  useful 
to  local  government  in  constructing  their  "seismic 
safety  element". 

Senate  Bill  1374,  also  of  long-range  importance, 
was  approved  by  the  Governor.  It  directs  the  Division 
of  Mines  and  Geology  to  organize,  monitor,  purchase 
and  install  strong-motion  instruments  in  representative 
structures  and  geological  environments  in  the  state. 
The  new  law  provides  funds  from  an  assessment  of  7^ 
on  each  $1000  of  the  cost  of  new  building  construc- 
tion. In  response,  the  State  Geologist  appointed  the 
Strong-Motion  Instrumentation  Board  and  the  Division 
began — in  July  1972 — to  purchase  and  install  the  first 
group  of  ten  accelerographs  at  strategic  points 
throughout  the  state.  The  first  major  goal  is  to  so  dis- 
tribute these  strong-motion  seismographs  as  to  get  a 
usable  record  of  ground  motion  wherever  in  the  state 
a  magnitude  6,  or  greater,  earthquake  may  occur.  Such 
records  are  of  great  significance  in  the  design  of  struc- 
tures for  earthquake  safety. 

Other   legislation   which   became   law  in    1971    in- 
cludes: Senate  Bill  386  which  allows  a  refund  for  taxes

paid  on  stocks  of  alcoholic  beverages  damaged  by  the 
recent  southern  California  earthquakes;  SB  388  which 
allows  a  refund  for  taxes  paid  on  cigarettes  damaged 
by  the  earthquakes;  SB  479  which  requires  a  geologic 
investigation  of  prospective  additions  to  schools  and 
proposed  school  sites;  AB  579  which  appropriates  $1 
million  for  disaster  indemnity  for  veterans;  SB  682 
requiring  the  Department  of  Public  Works  to  conduct 
and  complete  an  investigation  of  the  geological  condi- 
tions before  ending  the  reconstruction  of  highways; 
and  SB  778  requiring  building  departments  of  a  city 
or  county  to  maintain  plans  of  the  buildings,  for 
which  that"  department  has  issued  permits,  to  be  kept 
on  public  record. 

In  addition,  a  number  of  resolutions  were  passed 
dealing  with  a  moratorium  on  mortgage  payments 
(Senate  Concurrent  Resolution  38),  Federal  disaster 
relief  funds  (Assembly  Joint  Resolution  33),  a  Los 
Angeles  earthquake  study  (Assembly  Concurrent 
Resolution  44),  and  Senate  Concurrent  Resolution  84 
on  the  State  Capitol  earthquake  safety.  The  Los  Ange- 
les earthquake  study  (ACR  44)  was  completed  by  the 
consultants  hired  by  the  Hayes  subcommittee  and 
published  in  July  1972  (Legislature,  1972).  In  accord- 
ance with  SCR  84,  the  State  Architect  evaluated  the 
safety  of  the  West  Wing  of  the  Capitol.  This  old 
building,  built  in  the  late  1860s,  was  declared  unsafe 
by  the  State  Architect;  and  he  issued  a  report  in  July 
1972  with  estimated  costs  for  different  plans  for  re- 
habilitation and  reconstruction.  Meanwhile,  the  his- 
toric old  building  has  been  declared  out-of-bounds  for 
the  groups  of  school  children  which  have  toured  the 
Capitol  for  many  years. 

As  always,  many  bills  failed  to  survive  the  scrutiny 
of  legislative  committees,  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  A 
few,  which  dealt  with  such  matters  of  importance  as 
hospital  safety,  dangerous  buildings,  and  hazardous 
fault  zones,  were  recast  and  introduced  at  the  1972 
session  of  the  Legislature. 

Over  30  items  related  to  seismic  safety  were  con- 
sidered at  the  1972  session.  Early  in  the  1972  session. 
Resolution  No.  1,  cosponsored  by  Senator  Alquist  and 
Assemblyman  Hayes,  was  adopted  to  establish  a 
Seismic  Safety  Week  and  to  provide  for  the  placement 
of  historical  markers  on  the  fault-line  in  the  San 
Fernando  area.  Important  1972  measures  passed  and 
signed  by  the  Governor  include:  SB  519  concerning 
the  structural  safety  of  hospitals  in  earthquakes;  SB 
689  making  clarifying  changes  concerning  geologic 
and  soils  investigations  of  public  school  sites;  SB  896 
which  provides  that  cities  and  counties  shall  adopt 
emergency  procedures  for  evacuation  and  control  of 
populated  areas  below  dams  and  that  inundation  maps 
be  prepared;  SB  895  concerning  an  improved  basis  for 
fee  collecting  in  support  of  the  strong-motion  instru- 
mentation program;  SB  1324  requiring  that  the  State 
Council  on  Intergovernmental  Relations  provide  guide- 
lines for  the  preparation  of  seismic  safety  elements  now 
required  of  all  cities  and  counties;  SB  1452  providing 
that  the  school  bonds  intended  to  replace  Field-Act 
structures  need  only  receive  a  simple  majority  of  votes 
to  be  approved;  AB  2329  establishing  procedures  re- 
garding title   to   earthquake-disturbed  lands;  and  SB 


591  revising  the  seismic  safety  clement  to  require  ap- 
praisal of  mudslides,  landslides,  and  slope  stability  in 
general.  The  Governor  signed  SB  520  which  requires 
the  State  Geologist  to  prepare  maps,  for  the  use  of 
local  government,  to  designate  special  studies  zones 
along  major  active  faults.  The  new  law — effective  in 
March  1973 — expands  the  membership  of  the  State 
iMining  and  Geology  Board  and  instructs  that  body 
to  develop  policies  and  criteria  necessary.  The  Divi- 
sion of  Mines  and  Geology  began  tooling  up  for  this 
major  project  in  December  1972  in  anticipation  of 
the  measure's  becoming  law,  and  the  maps  were 
completed  by  the  end  of  1973. 

GOVERNOR'S  EARTHQUAKE  COUNCIL 

Prompted  by  the  need  for  a  broadly  coordinated 
approach  to  the  reduction  of  earthquake  hazards.  Gov- 
ernor Ronald  Reagan  appointed  the  Governor's  Earth- 
quake Council  in  January  1972.  The  Council  is  de- 
signed to  gather  all  forces  concerned  with  earthquake 
research  and  preparedness  in  California  under  a  single 
banner.  The  Council  consists  of  35  members  and  30 
alternates  representing  all  levels  of  government,  the 
universities,  the  private  sector,  and  the  general  public. 

The  Legislature's  Joint  Committee  on  Seismic 
Safety  is  formally  represented  on  the  Council,  and  a 
number  of  Advisory  Group  members  also  serve  on  the 
Council.  This  overlapping  membership  facilitates  full 
cooperation  between  the  Joint  Committee  and  the 
Council,  which  is  the  policy  of  both  organizations. 

The  Earthquake  Council  is  charged  with  advising 
the  Governor  on  measures  of  any  nature  that  should 
be  undertaken  to  reduce  future  earthquake  losses  in 
California.  These  recommendations  are  not  restricted 
to  those  for  action  by  State  agencies  but  are  to  en- 
compass all  entities  with  capabilities  in  earthquake- 
related  fields. 

The  organizational  meeting  of  the  Governor's 
Earthquake  Council  was  held  on  February  28,  1972. 
Its  chairman  is  a  member  of  the  Governor's  Cabinet, 
James  G.  Stearns,  Secretary  for  Agriculture  and  Serv- 
ices. The  Vice-Chairman  is  Herbert  R.  Temple,  Jr., 
Director  of  the  State  Office  of  Emergency  Services. 
Secretary  was  Wesley  G.  Bruer,  State  Geologist.  The 
Council  is  guided  by  a  nine-man  Steering  Committee 
consisting  of  the  officers  and  one  representative  from 
each  of  the  following  categories:  Federal  agencies, 
State  agencies,  universities,  local  government,  private 
organizations,  and  the  public-at-large.  Under  the  Steer- 
ing Committee  are  the  Preparedness  and  Response 
Committee  and  the  Research  and  Investigations  Com- 
mittee, chaired  by  the  Council  \^ice-Chairman  and 
the  Secretary,  respectively.  These  last  two  committees 
are  further  divided  into  sub-committees.  Alany  other 
individuals,  in  addition  to  formally  appointed  Council 
representatives  and  alternates,  contribute  their  special 
expertise  to  the  work  of  the  sub-committees  at  the 
request  of  sub-committee  chairmen. 

The  principal  effort  of  the  Council  to  date  has 
been  to  review  and  evaluate  the  recommendations  con- 
tained in  several  recent  and  comprehensive  studies  of 
earthquake  hazards  and  to  consider  other  feasible 
hazard-reduction  measures.  In  addition  to  recommend- 
ing that  certain  measures  be  taken,  special  attention 


I

will  be  given  to  means  of  implementing  the  recom- 
mendations. The  great  failing  of  most  previous  studies 
in  earthquake-hazard  reduction  has  not  been  in  scope 
or  content  but  in  lack  of  follow-through;  that  is,  no 
viable  mechanism  has  been  set  in  motion  to  carry  out 
the  recommendations  effectively. 

The  primary  thrust  of  Council  recommendations 
is  directed  toward  actions  which  may  be  taken  ad- 
ministratively by  all  types  of  public  and  private  enti- 
ties, although  not  exclusively  so.  The  primary  thrust 
of  recommendations  developed  by  the  Joint  Commit- 
tee on  Seismic  Safety  has  been  toward  legislation  at 
the  State  level  but  again  not  to  the  exclusion  of  other 
kinds  of  recommendations. 

The  first  report  to  the  Governor  by  the  Council 
was  completed  in  November  1972  and  was  approved 
by  Governor  Ronald  Reagan  on  December  12,  1972. 

Other  actions  by  the  Council  include  the  issuance 
of  a  statement  on  April  28  in  support  of  Proposition  2 
on  the  June  6  California  primary  election  ballot  to 
provide  State  financial  assistance  to  school  districts  to 
bring  schools  up  to  earthquake-resistant  standards  as 
required  by  law  by  June  30,  1975.  Proposition  2  was 
passed  at  the  June  6  election.  The  Council  also  has 
prepared  Suggested  hitermi  guidelines  for  the  seisifjic 
safety  element  in  general  plans  required  by  local  gov- 
ernments. The  Guidelines  has  now  been  distributed 
to  city  and  county  administrators  under  the  letterhead 
of  the  California  Council  on  Intergovernmental  Rela- 
tions which  is  represented  on  the  Council. 

CONCIUS/ON 

The  presentation  of  detailed  recommendations  for 
reducing  future  earthquake  losses  is  beyond  the  scope 
of  this  paper.  Indeed,  it  would  be  presumptuous  to  do 
so  here  in  view  of  the  massive  efforts  currently  being 
made  in  this  field  b&gt;'  the  Governor's  Earthquake  Coun- 
cil and  the  Legislature's  Joint  Committee  on  Seismic 
Safety,  in  which  both  authors  of  this  paper  are  par- 
ticipating. 

Recommendations  are  being  made  by  these  rvvo 
organizations  in  dozens  of  categories,  both  legislative 
and  administrative,  including  many  dealing  with:  pre- 
paredness, response,  and  recovery;  research  in  geology, 
seismology,  and  engineering;  socio-economic,  plan- 
ning, and  governmental  response  studies;  construction 
of  new  facilities  of  all  types;  rehabilitation  or  abandon- 
ment of  existing  hazardous  buildings,  dams,  bridges 
and  other  structures;  insurance;  information  and  edu- 
cation; and  the  creation  of  one  or  more  successor  co- 
ordinating bodies  to  carry  on  the  work  of  implement- 
ing these  recommendations. 

Careful  estimates  of  losses  from  future  severe 
earthquakes,  if  experienced  by  urban  areas  in  their 
present  ph\-sical  condition,  anticipate  fatalities  in  the 
thousands  and  damages  in  the  billions  of  dollars.  Most 
of  these  fatalities  and  some  of  the  damages  arc  pre- 
ventable if  the  proper  measures  arc  taken  before  the 
disaster  strikes.  \\'c  strongK-  urge  that  the  recommen- 
dations of  the  Joint  Committee  on  Seismic  Safety  and 
of  the  Governor's  Earthquake  Council  be  given  full 
consideration  and  support;  most  importantly,  such  of 
those  recommendations  as  are  approved  b\-  the  Legis- 
lature and  the  Governor  must  be  implemented  quickly 


and  thoroughly.  The  lives  of  thousands  of  Califomians 
are  in  the  balance. 

One  last  word  about  the  San  Fernando  earth- 
quake: if  the  current  efforts  in  earthquake-risk  reduc- 
tion— so  greatly  stimulated  by  that  event — are  suc- 
cessfully carried  out,  the  San  Fernando  earthquake 
will  indeed  have  achieved  a  significance  far  beyond 
that  warranted  by  its  Richter  magnitude.

Earthquake-Related  Activities  of  California  State  Agencies  ' 

OFFICE  OF  ARCHITECTURE  AND  CONSTRUCTION 

The  Office  of  Architecture  and  Construction  has  four 
specific  functions:  to  enforce  the  Field  Act,  to  do  earthquake 
research  and  develop  earthquake  regulations  and  codes,  to 
supervise  design  and  construction  of  various  state  facilities 
assigned,  and  to  report  on  repairs  of  disaster  damage. 

Since  the  Field  Act  was  passed  after  the  1933  Long 
Beach  earthquake,  efforts  have  been  directed  toward  min- 
imizing the  possibility  of  earthquake  damage  to  school  struc- 
tures. The  many  investigations  and  reports  (particularly, 
Mcehan  in  this  Bulletin)  indicating  low  public  school  damage 
in  the  1971  San  Fernando  earthquake  attest  to  the  success 
of  this  program. 

Much  information,  gained  from  the  review  of  the  per- 
formance of  school  buildings  exposed  to  earthquakes,  has 
been  used  to  develop  new  codes  and  enforcement  procedures. 

The  design  of  State  facilities  to  current  lateral-force 
standards  is  a  normal  procedure  in  OAC's  architectural  and 
engineering  development  of  projects.  An  example  is  the  lat- 
eral-force resistance  designed  into  the  new  Administration 
and  Librar&gt;-  Building  at  Ha&gt;'ward  State  University,  where 
design  criteria  in  excess  of  the  minimum  standards  were  in- 
corporated in  the  structure  because  of  the  close  proximity  of 
the  active  Hay  ward  fault.  On-site  construction  supervision 
insures  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  plans  and 
specifications  of  the  contract.  Experiences  with  recently  com- 
pleted public  buildings  in  the  San  Fernando  area  justify  this 
approach. 

OAC  is  involved  in  post-disaster  investigation  and  re- 
porting, whether  the  disaster  is  caused  by  an  earthquake  or 
by  fire  and  floods,  .\cting  as  representatives  of  the  Depart- 
ment of  Finance  and  the  State  Office  of  Emergency  Services, 
equitable  costs  are  recommended  for  federal  grants  to  local 
government  to  accomplish  repair  or  replacement  of  damaged 
buildings,  utilities,  and  other  related  projects.  Investigation 
in  the  field  actually  commences  on  disaster  day.  The  damage 
is  assessed  to  assist  the  Governor  in  determining  the  magni- 
tude of  the  disaster  and  to  assist  him  in  determination  of  the 
basis  for  requesting  a  Presidential  declaration  so  that  federal 
aid  can  be  provided.  Since  the  earthquake  in  1971,  OAC  has 
investigated,  inspected,  and  prepared  reports  on  more  than 
2000  claims  amounting  to  over  $275  million.  Much  additional 
work  remains  to  be  done. 

OFFICE  OF  EMERGENCY  SERVICES 

The  Office  of  Emergency  Services  is  authorized  by  the 
Emergency  Services  Act  (Chapter  7  of  Division  1  of  Title  2 
of  the  Government  Code),  which  places  it  within  the  Gov- 
ernor's Office. 

The  Act  designates  the  Director  as  the  State  Director  of 
Civil  Defense  and  State  Emergency  Planning  and  further 
'  .\dapted   from  statements   prepared   by   agencies  of  the   State 

and   presented   to   the   Governor's   Earthquake   Council   by 

Robert  B.  Jansen  on  February  28,  1972.

states,  "During  a  state-of-\var  emergency,  a  state  of  emer- 
gency, or  a  local  emergency,  the  Director  shall  coordinate  the 
emergency  activities  of  all  state  agencies  in  connection  with 
such  emergency."  The  act  also  charges  the  Office  to  develop 
and  maintain  the  State  Emergency  Plan,  which  is  the  basis 
for  state  agency  and  local  government  emergency  plans. 

The  Office  maintains  a  communications  center,  through 
which  the  Governor's  Office  receives  a  flow  of  information 
from  every  geographic  and  organizational  area  of  the  state. 
A  State  agency  or  a  local  government  official  may  notify  the 
Office  that  a  disaster  exists  or  is  imminent.  Immediate  noti- 
fication may  make  it  possible  to  anticipate  an  emergency  and 
blunt  its  effects  by  accelerated  preparations  or  even  to  pre- 
vent an  emergency   from   enlarging  to  disaster  proportions. 

The  Office  administers  and  coordinates  federal  disaster 
relief  activities  and  federal  financial  support  in  recovery 
efforts  after  a  major  disaster  has  been  declared  under  the 
authority  of  Public  Law  91-606. 

The  Office  is  responsible  for  coordinating  State  agencies 
in  developing  postdisaster  damage  assessment,  including  input 
from  local  governments  and  the  private  sector. 

The  responsibilities  of  OES  are  not  limited  to  earth- 
quakes, nor  are  they  significantly  different  for  other  major 
emergencies. 

DIVISION  OF  HIGHWAYS 

The  responsibility  for  the  operation  of  the  state  high- 
way system,  which  forms  the  framework  upon  which  the 
major  portion  of  the  state's  vehicles  travel,  imposes  a  heavy 
obligation  to  maintain  communications,  even  in  times  of 
disaster. 

The  objective  of  the  Division  of  Highways,  which  is  in 
the  Department  of  Public  Works,  is  to  prevent  any  traffic 
disruption  and,  in  the  event  of  such  catastrophes  as  earth- 
quakes and  floods,  to  restore  traffic  facilities,  at  least  tempo- 
rarily, as  soon  as  possible. 

It  is  impossible  to  design  structures  so  as  to  prevent 
all  damage;  the  forces  involved  are  too  overpowering  to  be 
fully  resisted.  It  is  to  be  expected  that  highway  structures 
caught  in  the  focal  area  of  destruction,  as  some  were  in  San 
Fernando,  will  be  considerably  damaged.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  Division  of  Highways  feels  a  great  responsibility  to 
prevent  any  loss  of  life  and  is  dedicated  to  a  program  of  de- 
signing highway  structures  that  will  not  collapse. 

The  valuable  lessons  learned  from  the  San  Fernando 
earthquake  were  immediately  incorporated  into  all  the  de- 
signs then  in  preparation  and  into  all  the  bridges  then  under 
construction.  A  program  has  been  instituted  to  go  back  into 
existing  bridges  which  contain  demonstrated  weaknesses  and 
strengthen  them. 

A  number  of  design  refinements  are  being  made  to  cor- 
rect demonstrated  weaknesses.  In  addition,  there  are  sev- 
eral research  programs  underway  seeking  to  develop  dynamic 
designs  for  earthquake  resistance.  These  recognize  that  the 
violent  motion  to  which  the  structures  may  be  subjected  can, 
in  some  cases,  because  of  the  additive  nature  of  the  wave 
motions  build  up  forces  considerably  higher  than  derived 
from  the  application  of  static  forces.  These  studies  should 
enable  more  realistic  determination  of  forces  and  movements 
and  lead  to  more  adequate  designs.  The  design  philosophy  is 
that,  while  it  is  to  be  expected  that  some  damage  will  result 
from  a  severe  earthquake,  every  effort  must  be  made  to 
prevent  total  collapse. 


Contracts  are  being  let  in  a  continuing  program  to  re- 
view existing  structures  to  improve  earthquake  resistability. 

DEPARTMENT  OF  HOUSING  AND  COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT 
The  enabling  authority  for  the  Department  of  Housing 
and  Community  Development  may  be  found  in  the  California 
Health  and  Safety  Code  and  the  Labor  Code. 

In  the  area  of  earthquake-related  responsibilities  and 
activities,  the  Department  has  responsibility  for  development, 
interpretation,  and  enforcement  of  statewide  building  and 
housing  standards. 

The  Department  also  works  closely  with  other  concerned 
State  agencies  in  the  development  of  building  standards  ap- 
plicable to  all  building  occupancies. 

DEPARTMENT  OF  INSURANCE 

This  Department  regulates  insurance  companies  trans- 
acting business  in  California  under  authority  granted  in  the 
Insurance  Code.  The  regulatory  objectives  of  the  Department 
relate  to  assuring  the  solvency  of  the  companies  pro\'iding 
coverage  to  California  policyholders  and  to  the  practices  of 
those  companies  as  they  affect  public  interest.  Specifically, 
companies  providing  earthquake  coverage  do  so  under  a  com- 
petitive system  wherein  the  rates  which  apply  to  the  cov- 
erage afforded  must  be  adequate  to  insure  solvency,  not  un- 
reasonably high  for  the  insurance  afforded,  and  not  unfairly 
discriminatory. 

Because  of  the  importance  of  insurance  as  a  potential 
factor  in  long-term  rehabilitation  of  property  damage  caused 
by  earthquakes,  the  Department  of  Insurance  has  taken  an 
active  interest  in  the  availability  of  earthquake  insurance  and 
the  problems  inherent  in  underwriting  this  type  of  coverage. 
As  a  member  of  the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Com- 
missioners subcommittee  on  the  availability  of  essential  in- 
surance, the  Department  has  participated  in  development 
of  a  program  being  presented  to  the  private  insurance  in- 
dustry that  could  lead  to  universal  earthquake  coverage  on 
homes  and  small  businesses  while,  at  the  same  time,  assuring 
that  the  effects  of  a  catastrophe  would  not  render  insurance 
companies  insolvent. 

COUNCIL  ON   INTERGOVERNMENTAL  RELATIONS 

The  Council  on  Intergovernmental  Relations  is  most  di- 
rectly involved  in  earthquake-related  activities  through  the 
recently  adopted  amendment  to  the  State  Planning  Law, 
which  requires  all  cities  and  counties  to  adopt  seismic  safety 
elements  as  part  of  their  general  plans.  CIR  provides  both 
technical  and  financial  assistance  to  local  government  in  the 
preparation  of  their  general  plans. 

CIR  distributed"  Suggested  Interim  Guidelines  For  The 
Seismic  Safety  Element^' as  prepared  by  the  Governor's  Earth- 
quake Council,  to  all  local  governments  in  July  1972, 

In  order  to  provide  more  advanced  guidelines  for  the 
preparation  and  content  of  seismic  safety  elements,  CIR  has 
developed  a  demonstration  seismic  safety  element  project.  A 
$66,000  grant  has  been  earmarked  for  a  three-city  seismic 
safety  program  to  be  conducted  in  1972-73  in  San  Pablo,  El 
Cerrito,  and  Richmond  in  western  Contra  Costa  County.  The 
California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology  is  preparing  the 
geologic  studies  under  contract  with  these  local  governments. 

CIR  staff  is  also  currently  reviewing  and  preparing  rec- 
ommendations for  revising  the  State  Planning  and  Zoning 
Law.  The  seismic  safety  element  requirement  of  the  State 
Planning  Law  will  also  be  considered  in  relation  to  other  plan- 
ning considerations.

California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology 


Bull.  196 


DIVISION  OF  MINES  AND  GEOLOGY 
The  responsibilities  of  the  California  Division  of  Mines 
and  Geology  in  the  Department  of  Conservation  are  as  fol- 
lows: (a)  to  represent  the  State's  interest  in  information 
pertaining  to  earthquake  and  other  geologic  hazards;  (b)  to 
conduct,  with  city  and  county  governments  or  federal  and 
other  state  agencies,  large-scale  geological  investigations  to 
identify  and  pro\'ide  timely  delineation  of  geological  hazards 
in  and  adjacent  to  metropolitan  areas;  (c)  to  organize  and 
monitor  a  strong-motion  instrumentation  program  in  the  state 
of  California;  and  (d)  to  identify  quickly  potential  post- 
earthquake  geologic  hazards,  particularly  weakened  slopes, 
that  could  be  activated  by  aftershocks. 

The  Division's  authority  is  provided  in  the  Public  Re- 
sources Code.  Its  objectives  are  to  reduce  losses  of  life  and 
property  caused  by  earthquakes  by  timely  identification  and 
delineation  of  earthquake  hazards  and  by  providing  ground- 
motion  response  data  useful  in  designing  and  building  struc- 
tures to  resist  earthquake  damage.  A  significant  addition  to 
the  Division's  earthquake  responsibilities  came  in  March 
1973  when  SB  520  requiring  the  State  Geologist  to  designate 
hazardous  fault  zones  became  law. 

The  earthquake-related  activities  include:  (a)  Geodim- 
eter  sur\-eys  along  the  San  Andreas  fault  system  to  measure 
changes  in  the  accumulation  of  crustal  strain;  (b)  tilt- 
meter  monitoring  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  system  for  dif- 
ferential vertical  changes;  (c)  installation  of  strong-motion 
instruments  on  carefully  selected  soil  and  rock  sites  and 
structures  throughout  the  state;  (d)  mapping  surface  breaks 
and  earthquake-triggered  landslides  in  the  vicinity  of  such 
recent  earthquakes  as  the  1971  San  Fernando  earthquake; 
(e)  publication  of  information  on  earthquakes  as  a  means 
of  public  education;  (f)  preparation  of  a  geologic  map  of 
California  showing  faults,  classified  as  to  their  recency  of 
movement;  (g)  cooperating  with  various  counties  and  cities 
in  preparing  seismic  hazard  analyses  and  providing  informa- 
tion necessary  for  the  preparation  of  seismic  safety  elements 
of  general  plans;  (h)  mapping  critical  segments  of  active 
faults;  (i)  providing  data  on  seismic  risk  to  California 
Power  Plant  Siting  Committee;  (j)  performing  required  staff 
work  for  the  Governor's  Earthquake  Council;  (k)  as  a  part 
of  the  HUD-Urban  Geology  Master  Plan  project,  preparation 
of  maps  of  California  show^ing  tsunami  vulnerability,  historic 
earthquake  recurrence,  expectable  earthquake  intensity,  and 
historic  earthquake  epicenters;  and  (/)  serving  as  a  clearing- 
house for  crustal-strain  monitoring  activities  and  programs 
and  instrumentation  in  California  by  publication  of  a  news- 
letter. 


MINING  AND  GEOLOGY  BOARD 

The  functions  of  the  Mining  and  Geology  Board  are  set 
forth  in  the  Public  Resources  Code,  Section  667,  as  follows: 

"The  board  shall  represent  the  State's  interest  in  the 
development,  utilization  and  conservation  of  the  mineral 
resources  of  the  state,  and  in  the  development,  collec- 
tion, collation  and  dissemination  of  geologic  information 
necessary  to  the  understanding  and  utilization  of  the 
state's  terrain  and  in  information  pertaining  to  earth- 
quake and  other  geologic  hazards.  It  may  establish  poli- 
cies conforming  to  the  provisions  of  State  statutes  to 
govern  the  administration  of  the  Division  of  Mines  and 
Geology" 


The  Board  advises  the  California  DiN-ision  of  Mines  and 
Geology  and  the  Department  of  Conservation  on  policies  and 
recommendations  for  programs  in  the  field  of  earthquakes 
and  other  geologic  hazards.  The  Geologic  Hazards  Committee 
of  the  Board  consists  of  a  geologist  member,  a  seismologist 
member,  and  a  structural  engineer  member.  Members  of  this 
committee  are  active  in  a  wide  range  of  groups  involved  in 
earthquake  studies  of  various  kinds;  they  bring  a  broad 
overview  of  activnties  conducted  in  this  field  to  the  Board, 
the  Division,  and  the  Department  and,  conversely,  dissem- 
inate information  to  other  groups  about  the  earthquake-re- 
lated activities  of  the  California  Division  of  Mines  and 
Geology. 

OFFICE  OF  PLANNING  AND  RESEARCH 
The  Office  of  Planning  and  Research  in  the  Governor's 
Office  is  in  the  process  of  preparing  a  statewide  plan  and  im- 
plementation program  for  protecting  land  and  water  resources 
which  are  of  statewide  significance  in  terms  of  California's 
natural  resource  base  and  the  preservation  and  enhancement 
of  environmental  quality  as  required  by  Government  Code 
Section  65049.  An  example  of  the  areas  to  be  covered  in- 
cludes ''areas  which  require  special  development  regulation 
because  of  hazardous  or  special  conditions  such  as  earth- 
quake fault  zones,  unstable  slide  areas,  flood  plains  and 
watersheds." 

Another  area  of  responsibility  for  OPR  is  the  evaluation 
of  environmental  impact  statements.  Although  the  evaluation 
is  specifically  from  the  standpoint  of  land  use  and  population, 
these  two  areas  are  related  to  any  potential  adverse  effect 
they  may  have  on  the  environment,  as  well  as  any  potential 
adverse  effect  the  environment  (earthquakes,  etc.)  may  have 
on  them. 

In  addition,  OPR  is  coordinating  the  development  and 
operation  of  a  statewide  environmental-monitoring  system  to 
assess  the  implications  of  present  growth  and  development 
trends  on  the  environment  and  to  identify,  at  an  early  time, 
potential  threats  to  public  health,  natural  resources,  and  en- 
vironmental quality.  This  bears  an  obvious  relationship  to 
earthquake-hazard  prevention  and  related  early  warning  sys- 
tems. 


DEPARTMENT  OF  REAL  ESTATE 

One  of  the  functions  of  the  Department  of  Real  Estate 
is  to  administer  the  Subdivided  Lands  Act.  This  Act  provides, 
in  part,  that  a  subdivider  is  required  to  give  a  copy  of  the 
subdivision  public  report  prepared  by  the  Department  of  Real 
Estate  to  each  prospective  purchaser  of  a  lot  or  parcel  in  a 
subdivision.  The  Department,  in  this  public  report,  discloses 
whether  geological  conditions  are  such  as  to  constitute  a 
hazard  to  the  tract  or  structures  thereon. 

The  Department's  responsibility  regarding  earthquake- 
related  conditions  is  one  of  full  disclosure  to  the  first  pur- 
chaser or  prospective  purchaser  of  lots  or  parcels  in  a  sub- 
division. 


DEPARTMENT  OF  WATER  RESOURCES 
The  Department  of  Water  Resources  is  responsible  for 
construction  and  operaUon  of  the  State  Water  Project  and  for 
the  safety  of  dams  in  California,  other  than  those  federally 
owned.  Authority  for  conducting  earthquake-related  investi- 
gations derives   from   this   responsibility.   The   objective  of

San  Fernando  Earthquake — Minimizing  Losses

these  programs  is  to  develop  the  data  and  technology  re- 
quired to  construct  and  maintain  safe,  economical,  and  re- 
liable water-supplies  and  facilities  and  to  assure  the  safety  of 
dams. 

In  19S8,  a  Consulting  Board  for  Earthquake  Analysis 
was  created  which  has  continued  to  provide  guidance  in  for- 
mulating and  implementing  a  comprehensive  program  of  seis- 
mological  and  earthquake  engineering  investigations.  This 
Board  consists  of  five  authorities  representing  seismology, 
geolog&gt;',  structural  engineering,  soil  mechanics,  and  construc- 
tion practices. 

The  Department's  seismic  investigations  fall  into  three 
categories : 

1.  Identification    and    evaluation    of    earthquake-related    haz- 
ards  at   sites   for   dams   and   water-supply   facilities. 

2.  The    study    of    seismic-related    ground    motions    and    defor- 
mations and   the   response   of  superimposed   structures. 

3.  The    design    of    dams    and    water-project    facilities    to    with- 
stand earthquake  effects. 

The  DWR  Sacramento  headquarters  serves  as  a  focal 
point  for  a  cooperative,  statewide  network  of  stations  selected 
from  six  separate  networks  of  seismographs  operated  by  the 
California  Institute  of  Technology-,  University  of  Nevada, 
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  Univer- 
sity of  California.  U.S.  Geological  Sur\-ey,  and  California  De- 
partment of  Water  Resources.  Seismic  disturbances  detected 
by  these  instruments  are  telemetered  to  Sacramento  where 
they  are  displayed  by  lights  on  maps.  The  Control  Center, 
which  is  manned  continuously,  is  thus  alerted  to  the  location 
of  any  significant  earthquakes  with  respect  to  dams  and  ele- 
ments of  the  State  Water  Project.  This  cooperative  seismo- 


graph network  is  the  only  one  in  California  which  approaches 
statewide  coverage. 

The  Department  also  sponsors  a  strong-motion  seismo- 
graph program,  comprised  of  91  seismoscopes  and  51  ac- 
celerometers.  These  instruments  are  located  near  facilities  of 
the  State  Water  Project  and  on  structures  of  the  State  Water 
Project.  This  program  has  evolved  to  meet  requirements  for 
analysis  procedures  and  design  which  are  an  outgrowth  of 
new  knowledge  of  earthquakes  and  of  the  dynamic  properties 
of  materials.  The  systems  are  triggered  during  a  seismic 
event  to  record  accelerations,  stresses,  and  hydraulic  pres- 
sures of  a  dynamic  and  transient  nature. 

Output  from  the  instrumentation  program  is  evaluated, 
following  all  significant  seismic  disturbances,  in  a  continuing 
endeavor  to  improve  earthquake-design  criteria.  Valuable  in- 
formation was  obtained  from  DWR-NO.\.\  instruments  during 
the  Parkfield  earthquakes  of  June  27,  1966.  and  the  San 
Fernando  earthquakes  of  February  9,  1971. 

Due  to  the  unparalleled  events  accompanying  the  San 
Fernando  earthquake  of  February  9.  1971,  DWR's  Division 
of  Safety  of  Dams  has  increased  its  earthquake-engineering 
program  substantially.  An  engineering  investigation  of  the 
effects  on  Van  Norman  Reser\'oir  Complex  was  initiated  to 
determine  the  mechanism  of  the  slides  in  the  two  hydraulic- 
fill  dams.  The  Division  has  required  owners  of  other  hy- 
draulic-fill dams  to  conduct  earthquake-engineering  investiga- 
tions and  will  require  strengthening  of  any  dam  not  found 
earthquake  resistant.  The  Division  is  also  helping  a  county- 
organized  task  force  to  prepare  a  report  advising  the  Los 
Angeles  County  Board  of  Supervisors  on  those  recommenda- 
tions of  the  Los  Angeles  County  Earthquake  Commission 
which  relate  to  dams.
