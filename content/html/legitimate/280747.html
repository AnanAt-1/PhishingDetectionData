<H2>What it does</H2>
The perl script 
"<A HREF="scripts/index.html">mathinhtml</A>" allows anyone to easily include 
mathematical content in web pages.  For example, it will convert the
string

<P><CODE>
The graph of &lt;EQ>y = {x^3 \over x-4}&lt;/EQ> looks like
&lt;CENTER>&lt;GR>plot [-18:13][-200:300] x**3/(x-4) &lt;/GR>&lt;/CENTER>
</CODE><P>

into the output:<P>

The graph of <IMG  SRC="IMG_0.png" WIDTH="76" HEIGHT="41" ALT="y = {x^3 over x-4}" TITLE="y = {x^3 over x-4}" ALIGN="CENTER"> looks like
<CENTER><IMG  SRC="IMG_1.png" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="252" ALT="plot [-18:13][-200:300] x**3/(x-4)" TITLE="plot [-18:13][-200:300] x**3/(x-4)" ALIGN="TOP"></CENTER>

HREF="examples/index.html">examples of mathinhtml output</A>.<P>


<H2>How it all started</H2>
In Fall 2002, I wanted to provide my calculus students with web pages
of homework problems.  Faced with the daunting task of assembling (and
then keeping track of) collections of dozens of images for each page,
I looked about for some way to automate the process.  I wanted to be
able to write a web page, pretending that web browsers could interpret
standard mathematical notation, and then have it translated into a web
page that could really be interpreted by all browsers. Finding nothing
that suited my needs, I decided to write such a translator myself.


<H2>How it works</H2>
Mathinhtml works by scanning a "mathinhtml source file" for special
elements, and replacing those elements by text or a link to an image
file.  The current default elements and their actions include<P>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD>&lt;EQ> . . . &lt;/EQ></TD>
<TD>The contents are run through TeX in "display style", and the
resulting dvi file is converted to an image file.  The element is
replaced by a link to this image file.</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>&lt;GR> . . . &lt;/GR></TD>
<TD>The contents are run through gnuplot with some added options for
graphing, then the resulting postscript file is converted to an image
file.  The element is replaced by a link to this image file.</TD>
</TR>
<TD>&lt;DIA> . . . &lt;/DIA></TD>
<TD>The contents are run through the perl script gpdiagram, then the
resulting postscript file is converted to an image file.  The element
is replaced by a link to this image file.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
In addition, there are tags &lt;TEX> . . . &lt;/TEX> and &lt;GNUPLOT> . . . 
&lt;/GNUPLOT> that feed their contents directly to their respective
programs.

<P>The script is designed for easy extensibility, so you can add
additional elements as you see fit.  Mathinhtml can drive any program that
takes a text file as input and produces text or a postscript file
as output.

<H2>Alternatives to mathinhtml</H2>
There are a number of different approaches to putting mathematical
objects on web pages.<P>

If you prefer writing web pages in a "what you see is what you get"
environment, then try <A
HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</A>.  If you prefer
writing in a markup language, but would rather write in LaTeX than in
html, then see Steve Mayer's <A
HREF="http://www.mayer.dial.pipex.com/tex.htm"> TeX Converter</A>
page.  If you prefer to write in html, then mathinhtml will suit your
needs.  If you don't need to include graphs on your pages, then have a
look at <A
HREF="http://www.math.uio.no/~martingu/gladtex/">GladTeX</A> also.

<H2>Requirements</H2>

This script has been tested only for Linux and Windows 98, but I'd
like it to be as portable as possible.  To that end, I intentionally
wrote it to use software that is free (as in beer and speech) and
available for a wide range of operating systems.<P>

Mathinhtml requires perl 
(<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/info/software.html">
          http://www.perl.com/pub/a/language/info/software.html<A>)
and Ghostscript
(<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/ghostscript/ghostscript.html">
         http://www.gnu.org/software/ghostscript/ghostscript.html</A>)
for its basic operations.  To use the EQ element, you will need TeX 
(<A HREF="http://www.ams.org/tex/public-domain-tex.html">
          http://www.ams.org/tex/public-domain-tex.html</A>).
To use the GR element, you will need gnuplot
(<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnuplot.info/pub/gnuplot">
          ftp://ftp.gnuplot.info/pub/gnuplot<A> 
   - see the README file for what it all means).

<H2>Installation</H2>
<UL>

<LI>Download the <A HREF="scripts/index.html">mathinhtml script</A>.

<LI>If necessary, alter the beginning of the script to correspond
with the program names on your system.  Windows users will need to rename
the file to <CODE>mathinhtml.bat</CODE>.

<LI>Check that it all works by downloading <A
HREF="test/test.mih">test.mih</A> into a temporary folder, running
the command <CODE>mathinhtml test.mih test.html</CODE> and looking at 
<CODE>test.html</CODE> with your favorite browser.
</UL>

<H2>Use</H2>

Mathinhtml is a "web page preprocessor".  What this means is that you
write a "mathinhtml source file" for your page, and mathinhtml
translates this source file to the actual html file that you put on
the web.  Any editorial changes must be made to the source file, which
must then be retranslated.<P>

The mathinhtml source file contains everything (text, html markup, and
"ordinary" images) that you want in your html page, except for the
mathematical images (e.g. equations and graphs).  In the places that
these math images are to appear, the source file contains special
elements that describe to mathinhtml what the math images should look
like.  For example, the element <CODE>&lt;EQ>y=x^2&lt;/EQ></CODE>
tells mathinhtml that you want an image of the equation <IMG  SRC="IMG_2.png" WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="21" ALT="y=x^2" TITLE="y=x^2" ALIGN="CENTER">
to appear at that point.<P>

To get a feel for this, use your favorite text editor to make some
changes to the test.mih file (that you downloaded to check your
installation), then run "mathinhtml test.mih test.html", and look at
test.html with your favorite browser to see the effect of those
changes.  Note in particular that (for efficiency) mathinhtml
retranslates only those images that you have altered.

<H2>Stability and feedback</H2>

I am releasing this software under the "release early and often"
mantra.  Among other things, this means that this is currently beta
software, that its specifications are not yet completed, and that it
is likely to have bugs.  While I will try to maintain backward
compatibility, future versions may drift in ways as yet
unpredictable.<P>

I'd very much appreciate bug reports (and suggested solutions if you
have them), requests for features, and notes of appreciation.  While
the script suits my needs, I am sure that there are many ways it can
be improved, and your feedback will help that process greatly. I can
be reached at millermj.mail.lemoyne.edu (replace the first dot with an
@).

<H2>Security</H2>
The mathinhtml script should NOT be used in an insecure environment
(for example, as part of an interactive web page where untrusted users
can type in input to be translated by mathinhtml.)  The reason is that
pathological input may allow a malicious user to compromise your
machine.

<H2>Specifications</H2>

A "mathinhtml source file" is an html file which includes "special
elements".  The specifications for special elements are below;
everything else is copied unchanged to the output file (and so must be
well-formed html.)<P>

To define terms, label the parts of the special element 
<CODE>&lt;EQ ALIGN="TOP">y=x^2&lt;/EQ></CODE> as follows.<P>

<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD>&lt;EQ ALIGN="TOP"></TD><TD>start tag      </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>EQ                 </TD><TD>tag name       </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ALIGN="TOP"        </TD><TD>attribute      </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ALIGN              </TD><TD>attribute name </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>TOP                </TD><TD>attribute value</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>y=x^2              </TD><TD>contents       </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>&lt;/EQ>            </TD><TD>end tag        </TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>

For special elements, mathinhtml requires the following:
<UL>

<LI>All tags must be balanced (every start tag must have a
corresponding end tag.)

<LI>Tag names may not contain whitespace.

<LI>All attribute values must be in quotes (either single-quotes
or double-quotes), and the value itself may not contain the kind of quotes
that deliminate it.

<LI>Contents and attribute values may contain any characters (including
&lt;, &gt; and &amp;) except the strings &lt;P>, &lt;BR>, &lt;LI> and
&lt;TD> and the end tag of the element.

</UL>

<H2>What mathinhtml really does</H2>

Mathinhtml reads your source file in chunks (parts ending with &lt;P>,
&lt;BR>, &lt;LI> and &lt;TD>). It then scans each chunk for special
elements, extracting the tag name, attributes and contents of each.
As directed by the rules for that element (located at the beginning of
the script), mathinhtml formats the contents according to the "input"
rule(s), writes the formatted text to the file
<CODE>tempfile.n</CODE>, then asks your operating system to run the
programs specified in the "action" rule. If this creates a file named
<CODE>tempfile.ps</CODE>, then the script converts this to an image
file and replaces the special element by a link to that image file;
otherwise, the script replaces the special element by the text output
of your action rule.<P>

Html attributes (e.g. <CODE>ALIGN="TOP"</CODE>) may be included in the
element rules (e.g. as <CODE>attrib => 'ALIGN="TOP"'</CODE>) or within
an individual element's start tag (e.g. as
<CODE>&lt;EQ&nbsp;ALIGN="TOP"> y=x^2 &lt;/EQ></CODE>).  Attributes set
for individual elements override those set by the rules, which
override those set by the mathinhtml script itself.


<H2>Adding elements to mathinhtml</H2>

If you frequently find yourself typing the same thing, you may want to
define a new element.  This can be done by cloning an existing element and
then altering the "input" line accordingly.  For an example of how to
do this, look at the mathinhtml script to see how the rules for EQ are
derived from the rules for TEX.<P>

If you want to do something that cannot be easily accomplished from
TeX or gnuplot, you may want to add a new program to mathinhtml's
repertoire.  To do this, you will need to find a program that can
produce either a text or a postscript version of what you want in your
html file.  Create the rules for your new element in accordance with
"What mathinhtml really does" (above).

<CENTER><H1>Improvements and workarounds</H1></CENTER>

<H2>To do - new features</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Allow a "preprocess" rule for each element.  This rule would
be perl code which would be applies to the contents of the element 
before they were written to <CODE>tempfile</CODE>.
<LI>Improve print quality.
<LI>Decide how to present TeX errors.
<LI>Compress images.
</UL>


<H2>To do - fix bugs</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Get image baselines better aligned with text baselines.
</UL>

<H2>Workarounds</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Ghostscript antialiasing bug
   <UL>
   <LI>Symptom: "Unrecoverable error: range check in .putdeviceprops"
   <LI>Cause: Old versions of ghostscript don't allow antialiasing in png 
       files.
   <LI>Workaround: Edit the mathinhtml script and set -dTextAlphaBits=1 and 
       -dGraphicsAlphaBits=1 in the subroutine ps2png.
