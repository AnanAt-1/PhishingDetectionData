<B>Jan 5:&#160; Sidus Pictures buys remake rights to Fukasaku's <I>Fall Guy</I></B>&#160;&#160;  According to a Japanese newspaper report, Sidus Pictures CEO Tcha Seung-jai has purchased remake rights to the late Japanese director Fukasaku Kinji's <I>Fall Guy</i> ("Kamata koshin-kyoku").  The comic romance about a film star who abuses the generosity of an adoring fan was a critical and popular smash upon its release in 1982.  Having signed a contract for the rights with writer Tsuka Kouhei, Sidus -- the company responsible for <I>Memories of Murder</i> (2003), Korean-Japanese co-production <I>Rikidozan</i> (2004), and many other films -- is currently developing the script.<P><br>

<B>Jan 10:&#160; Jeonju festival unveils digital omnibus project</B>&#160;&#160;  At a press conference on January 10, the Jeonju International Film Festival presented the directors who will take part in the 2005 "Digital Short Films by Three Filmmakers" project.  Every year, three well-known international directors are each asked to shoot a 30-minute short film, and then the films are screened together during the festival in Jeonju.  This year's participating filmmakers will be Korean director Song Il-gon (<i>Flower Island</i>, <i>Spider Forest</i>), Japanese director Tsukamoto Shinya (<i>A Snake of June</i>, <i>Tetsuo</i>), and Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul (<i>Tropical Malady, Blissfully Yours</i>).<P><br>


<B>Jan 11:&#160; Kim Soo-yong resigns as head of ratings board</B>&#160;&#160;  Kim Soo-yong, the veteran director who has led a controversial reign as chairman of the Korea Media Ratings Board, submitted his resignation to the government as promised on January 11.  Kim was taking responsibility for a bribery scandal involving a member of the games rating committee, and although he was not believed to be personally involved in the scandal, he resigned as the senior figure in charge.  Until the board's current three-year term expires on June 6, his position will be filled by former vice chairman Lee Gyeong-soon.<P><br>



<B>Jan 25:&#160; PiFan fires staff, will not hire festival director</B>&#160;&#160;  Amid continuing controversy, the organizing committee of the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan) decided on January 25 to fire its programmers and related staff, and to hold its 9th edition in July without a festival director.  The decision comes against a public backlash against the festival for its decision to fire popular festival director Kim Hong-joon on December 29.  Citing an inability to work amidst the controversy, Kim's replacement Jung Hong-taek also submitted his resignation on January 21.  The organizing committee, headed by Bucheon mayor Hong Geon-pyo, said it would hire new programmers and staff in the coming weeks who would fulfill the duties of the former festival director.<P><br>

<B>Jan 31:&#160; Seoul court orders <I>President's Last Bang</i> to be cut</B>&#160;&#160;  On January 31, the Seoul Central Court ordered that four minutes of documentary footage be removed from Im Sang-soo's controversial <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#lastbang">The President's Last Bang</A></i>, a loose retelling of the assassination of authoritarian president Park Chung-hee in 1979.  The court was ruling on a lawsuit to block the film's release filed by Park's son, Park Ji-man, who argued that the film would damage the reputation of the former president.  While rejecting the lawsuit, the judge ruled that four minutes of documentary footage inserted in the film could cause viewers to become "confused" about fiction and reality.  The ruling provoked a furious response from the industry, and widespread debate about freedom of expression in contemporary Korean society.  Production company MK Pictures, meanwhile, decided to replace the censored footage with four minutes of black screen, considering that the ruling came only three days before its scheduled Feb 3 release.  MK also filed a lawsuit to have the decision reversed.  The film's release had already been thrown into disarray when distributor CJ Entertainment announced on January 26 that it was dropping the film from its lineup and recalling its $1m investment, due to "political sensitivities."<P><br>

<p>

<B>Feb 9:&#160; Japanese film collector rumored to hold <I>Arirang</i> (1926) dies</B>&#160;&#160;  Legendary Japanese film collector Abe Yoshishige, who together with his father amassed a collection of 50,000 classic films, passed away in Osaka on February 9 at the age of 81.  With no heir, the collection has gone into the care of the Japan Foundation, who charged the National Film Center with examining and cataloguing the estimated 450,000 reels of film. Rumours had previously surfaced that Abe was holding a copy of <I>Arirang</i> (1926), Korea's most famous silent-era film that was hailed as a masterpiece, and which was believed to have been irrevocably lost.  A visiting Korean scholar is said to have confirmed that an entry existed in Abe's records reading "Arirang / 9 reels / contemporary drama", together with entries for 60 other classic Korean films, but the existence of such prints was never confirmed.  Representatives from the Japan Foundation have expressed hope that the print of <I>Arirang</i> will be found in the coming months, and stated that they may request the help of film specialists from Korea in locating and identifying the print.<P><br>


<IMG SRC="leeej4.jpg" HEIGHT=200 ALT="Lee Eun-ju" ALIGN="right" HSPACE=16 VSPACE=8>

<B>Feb 22:&#160; Actress Lee Eun-ju commits suicide</B>&#160;&#160;  <A HREF="actors.html#leeej">Lee Eun-ju</A>, who starred in nine films since her debut in 1999 including <I>Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors</i> (2000), <I>Bungee Jumping of Their Own</i> (2001), <I>Lovers Concerto</I> (2002), <I>Taegukgi</I> (2004) and <I>The Scarlet Letter</I> (2004), was found dead in her apartment on February 22 after hanging herself.  The 24-year old had been undergoing treatment for depression in the year before her death.  Lee's body was cremated, amidst a massive outpouring of grief from fans and members of the film industry.<p><br>


<B>Feb 22:&#160; Four colonial-era films discovered</B>&#160;&#160;  Following a search carried out at the request of Korean Film Archive chairman Yi Hyo-in, four Korean films made between 1938 and 1941 were discovered in archives in China.  Three of the four can be characterized as pro-Japanese propaganda films: <I>Gunyong-yeolcha</i> (1938, 66 min.) by Seo Gwang-jae, <I>Jip-omneun cheonsa</i> (1941, 73 min.) by Choi In-gyu, and <I>Jiwonbyeong</I> (1941, 56 min.) by An Seok-young.  The fourth film is a melodrama titled <I>Eohwa</i> (1939, 52 min.) by An Cheol-young, about the daughter of a poor fisherman who drowns at sea.  The films now rank as the oldest complete Korean features to survive to the present day.  Also discovered in Japanese archives were five newsreels: four made in 1945 documenting Korea's newfound independence and totaling 30 minutes, and one made in 1938 totaling 12 minutes.<p>

<B>Mar 15:&#160; CJ announces partnership with Japan's Kadokawa</B>&#160;&#160;  CJ Entertainment, which in the past year has emerged as Korea's most powerful film company, announced a wide-ranging partnership with Japanese company Kadokawa Holdings on March 15.  The two companies agreed to produce films together -- including projects based on Kadokawa books, manga or movies -- and to cooperate in the fields of investment, international sales, book publishing, and multiplex construction.  In particular, Kadokawa will share its expertise with CJ in the field of publishing, while CJ will help Kadokawa in expanding its exhibition chain.  Incidentally, both companies also own investment stakes in Hollywood's DreamWorks, raising the possibility that future co-productions will also involve the US company in some way.<p><br>

<B>Mar 17:&#160; <I>April Snow</i> press visit attracts 350 journalists</B>&#160;&#160;  In one of the most visible displays yet of Korean pop culture's newfound influence in the Asian region, a visit to the set of Hur Jin-ho's upcoming film <I><A HREF="kfilm05.html#aprilsnow">April Snow</A></i> attracted over 350 local and international press members, including 100 reporters who flew in at their own expense from Japan.  Also present at the event were journalists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and Singapore.  The primary draw for the news outlets who sent these journalists was actor Bae Yong-joon (<I><A HREF="kfilm03.html#scandal">Untold Scandal</A></i>), who has developed an unprecedented fan following in Japan after the broadcast of his TV drama <I><A HREF="http://www.koreanfilm.org/tvdramas/wintersonata.html">Winter Sonata</A></i>.  According to distributor Show East, from 50-100 Japanese tourists per day have been staying in Samcheok, the small city in Kangwon Provice that hosts the film's shooting, in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the actor.<p>

<B>Apr 13:&#160; Former PiFan programmers announce rival fest</B>&#160;&#160;  The former director and programmers of the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival, who were fired under the initiative of Bucheon mayor Hong Geon-pyo (see Jan 25), have announced that they will hold a rival event in Seoul during the same week as PiFan.  The "Real Fantastic Film Festival" will run in July on one-twentieth the budget of its larger rival, and will feature approximately 50 films, including "Marx Attacks! -- Sci-fi Movies from Eastern Europe" organized with the Neuchatel festival of Switzerland.  "We don't intend this to be an 'anti-PiFan' event that denies their right to hold a festival, however we felt that holding RealFanta during the same period as PiFan would be the best way to call attention to the problems occuring in Puchon," said Kim Hong-joon, the former festival director at Puchon.  Festival organisers are also exploring the possibility of finding a new, permanent home for their event from next year.  With dozens of letters of support received from abroad and the Korean Producers' Association promising that not a single Korean film will be submitted to Puchon, RealFanta will enjoy a significant moral edge over its rival.<p>

<B>Apr 28 - May 6:&#160; 2005 Jeonju International Film Festival</B>&#160;&#160;  The Jeonju International Film Festival, held in the southwestern city of Jeonju, wrapped up its sixth edition on May 6 with a star-filled screening of Yim Phil-sung's <I><A HREF="kfilm05.html#antarctic">Antarctic Diary</A></i>.
Featuring a total of 176 films, the festival issued a total of 69,000 tickets for this year's event, which exceeded the organizers' goal of 55,000.  The Woosuk award for best film in the Indie Vision section went to Russian director Marina Razbezhkina for her film <I>Harvest Time</i> (2004), while the top prize in the Digital Spectrum section, the JJ Star award, was shared between Czech documentary <I>Czech Dream</i> (2004) by Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda and Chinese film <I>Oxhide</I> (2004) by Liu Jia Yi.  Retrospectives were devoted to Japanese director Somai Shinji and a focus on Maghreb Cinema from Morocco and Tunisia.  Buzz films at the event included the opening film, Digital Short Films by Three Filmmakers (see Jan. 10) and Kim Jin-sung's <I><A HREF="kfilm05.html#geochilmaru">Geochilmaru: The Showdown</A></i>, a $200,000 digital feature starring eight real-life martial arts masters in a competition staged in the mountains.

<B>May 11-22:&#160; Record number of Korean films at Cannes</B>&#160;&#160;  A record seven Korean feature films were selected to screen in various sections of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.  Featured in the main competition section was the sixth film by Hong Sang-soo <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#geukjangjeon">Tale of Cinema</A></i>, which received a somewhat muted reception and did not receive any awards.  Meanwhile Kim Jee-woon's <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#bittersweet">A Bittersweet Life</A></i> was presented as a special out-of-competition screening and drew widespread press coverage and largely positive reviews. <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#bow">The Bow</A></i>, the 12th film by noted director Kim Ki-duk, was selected as the opening film of the Un Certain Regard sidebar section.  Two Korean features also screened in the Director's Fortnight sidebar: Ryoo Seung-wan's <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#cryingfist">Crying Fist</A></i>, which ended up taking home a FIPRESCI Award, and Im Sang-soo's <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#lastbang">The President's Last Bang</A></i>, which was also very well received.  Finally, ethnic Korean director Zhang Lu presented his Chinese-Korean co-production <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#graininear">Grain in Ear</A></i> in the Critics Week section, where it was presented with a small prize.  Finally, the 15-minute short <i>walk On a Little More</i> by Shim Min-young screened in the Cinefondation section for film students.  Apart from Hong Sang-soo, this marked the first trip to Cannes for all of these filmmakers.<p><br>


<B>May 28:&#160; An Cheongsook named new KOFIC chair</B>&#160;&#160;  As the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) embarked upon its third three-year term since its re-organization in 1999, An Cheongsook, a former editor of weekly film magazine <i>Cine21</i> and a longtime journalist for the Hankyoreh Newspaper, was named the organization's new chairperson.  She replaces Lee Choong-jik, who was credited with bringing some much-needed stability during his term from 2002-2005, following the strife-ridden years of 1999-2002.  Eight other film industry people join An on KOFIC's board of commissioners, including vice chair Lee Hyun-seung (director of <i><A HREF="kfilm00.html#ilmare">Il Mare</A></i>), documentary filmmaker Kim Dong-won (<i><A HREF="docs.html#repatriation">Repatriation</A></i>), actress/film professor Chang Mi-hee (who also served as vice chair in the previous term), and leading producer Shim Jae-myung (<I><A HREF="kfilm00.html#jsa">JSA</A>, <A HREF="kfilm05.html#lastbang">The President's Last Bang</A></i>) of MK Pictures.<p><br>

<p>

<B>Jun 1:&#160; Cinema Service and CJ merge sales divisions</B>&#160;&#160;  CJ Entertainment and Cinema Service, two of Korea's biggest film companies, agreed to carry out a merger of their international sales divisions on June 1.  Although the two companies had formerly been rivals, they have moved closer in recent times with CJ providing financing for many of Cinema Service's films and buying out a non-controlling 40% of the company.  As a result of the merger, the combined sales division (which will go under the name of CJ Entertainment) will represent far more films than any other company which sells Korean films to foreign territories.<p><br>


<B>Jun 24:&#160; KOFIC to be relocated to Busan </B>&#160;&#160;  The Korean Film Council (KOFIC), which has operated in Seoul since its establishment in 1973, is scheduled to move to the city of Busan sometime between the years 2008 and 2012.  The decision was included in a far-reaching government plan announced on June 24 to relocate government-run organizations out of the capital, thus giving a boost to regional economies.  Joining KOFIC in Busan, which is famous for the Pusan Film Festival, will be the Korea Media Ratings Board.  The Korean Film Archive, which has already opened construction on a new Seoul-based facility to open in 2007, is scheduled to remain in Seoul. The decision to move KOFIC opens up some difficult questions, such as whether to also relocate the Korean Academy of Film Arts and the Namyangju Studio Complex, both of which are operated by KOFIC.<p><br>

<B>Jun 24:&#160; Korean producers lash out at talent management companies</B>&#160;&#160;  On June 24, the Korean Motion Picture Producers Association called a press conference to launch a stinging attack on the activities of talent management companies.  Producers charged that management companies were taking advantage of the increasing power of major stars, particularly in the Asian market, by charging high fees and also demanding co-production status for films which starred a company's actors.  Claiming that such activities were illegal in many other markets, including Hollywood, the producers association called for an end to the practice.  Shortly after the press conference, a group of talent management companies agreed to discuss the producers' concerns, and both sides announced a temporary resolution to the issue a month later.  However, shortly after the producers' press conference, an article was published in which director/producer Kang Woo-suk of Cinema Service lambasted Korean actors for being "greedy" and "money-obsessed," indicating actors Choi Min-shik and Song Kang-ho by name.  This spat ultimately drew far more press coverage than the original press conference, with Choi and Song demanding and eventually receiving an public apology from Kang.<p><br>

<B>Jul 8:&#160; <i>Marathon</i> wins Grand Bell Awards</b>&#160;&#160;  Jeong Yun-cheol's debut feature <i>Marathon</i>, about an autistic boy encouraged by his mother to do long-distance running, came away the big winner at the 42nd Grand Bell Awards held on July 8. The film won 7 of the 24 awards presented at the event, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Cho Seung-woo), Best New Director, Best Planning, Best Screenplay, Best Music, and a Popularity Award for Cho Seung-woo.  Other awards included a Best Jury Prize to Ryoo Seung-wan's <i>Crying Fist</i>, Best Actress for Kim Hye-soo (<i>Hypnotized</i>), Best Director to Song Hye-sung (<i>Rikidozan</i>), Best Supporting Actor to Hwang Jeong-min (<i>A Bittersweet Life</i>), and Best Supporting Actress to Na Mun-hee (<i>Crying Fist</i>).  <p><br>

<B>Jul 14-23:&#160; PiFan and rival festival Real Fanta compete for audiences</b>&#160;&#160;  After growing in its first eight years into Korea's second-most prominent film festival, the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival was wracked by controversy in 2005.  Following the dismissal of popular festival head Kim Hong-joon in late December 2004, and the subsequent firing of the programming team and much of the festival's staff in January, the festival opened under a widely-observed boycott by audiences and press members.  At the same time, Kim and his former programming team opened a smaller rival festival in Seoul called the Real Fantastic Film Festival (see Apr 13).  The Real FFF ultimately won over strong support from the local film industry and sold roughly 50% of its tickets.  PiFan saw a major drop in attendance and received just the bare minimum of local press coverage, though many international guests described themselves as being "won over" by the efforts of programmer Zeong Cho-sin and other staff members to hold the event amidst the many difficulties facing them.  On July 23, PiFan's top award was presented to Canadian director Paul Fox's <i>The Dark Hours</i>.<p><br>

The film would ultimately become the highest grossing Korean film within the calendar year 2005 (although hit film <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#kingandclown">King and the Clown</A></i>, released on December 29, would go on to sell more tickets in 2006).  Unusually, the success of the film took place as another film adapted from a Jang Jin stage play, <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#baksu">Murder, Take One</A></i> (released on August 12, and directed by Jang himself) went on to sell another 2.5 million tickets. <p><br>

Although the film did not win any awards from the official jury, it was presented with three minor awards from alternate juries (see festival awards section below).  In addition, Hong Joon-won's short film <i>Happy Birthday</i> screened in the festival's short film competition section.<p><br>

<B>Sep 15:&#160; <i>Welcome to Dongmakgol</i> selected as Oscar entry</b>&#160;&#160;  On September 15, a five-member jury appointed by the Korean Film Council chose <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#dongmakgol">Welcome to Dongmakgol</A></i> as Korea's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of the 2006 Academy Awards.  Each country has the right to choose and submit one film per year to be included in this category.  The film was selected from among 8 applications submitted by film production companies, with the other films being Kim Ki-duk's <i><A HREF="kfilm04.html#3iron">3-Iron</A></i>, Lee Myung-se's <i>Duelist</i>, Hur Jin-ho's <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#aprilsnow">April Snow</A></i>, Park Chan-wook's <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#geumja">Sympathy For Lady Vengeance</A></i>, Jeong Yun-cheol's <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#marathon">Marathon</A></i>, Ryoo Seung-wan's <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#cryingfist">Crying Fist</A></i> and Kim Jee-woon's <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#bittersweet">A Bittersweet Life</A></i>.

<B>Sep 20:&#160; Restored <i>Robot Taekwon V</i> unveiled</b>&#160;&#160;  Following a two-year restoration effort, classic animated feature <i>Robot Taekwon V</i> (1976) by Kim Cheong-ki was screened for journalists in Seoul.  The first Korean film to be digitally restored in its entirety, the $1 million Korean Film Council-financed restoration was carried out by 72 people who restored each of the film's 108,852 frames one by one.  The restoration involved color correction, reduction of grain, erasing of dirt and scratches, and the creation of a new 5.1ch Dolby soundtrack.  The film, which holds nostalgic value for many Koreans who grew up in the 1970s, tells the story of two inventors and their children who join forces against a mad scientist.  Previous partial restorations of Korean films include Yu Hyun-mok's <i>An Empty Dream</i> (1966) and Im Kwon-taek's <i>Mandala</i> (1980).<p><br>

Both the program itself (a record 307 films) and the side events that took place at the festival were expanded, including the launch of the Asian Film Academy (AFA) for young Asian filmmakers.  Organizers also announced midway through the event that a major film market -- dubbed the Asian Film Market -- would be unveiled in the 2006 edition.  A record crowd attended the festival, with 192,970 tickets issued, and a total of 7,647 local and international guests were registered.  The New Currents jury, chaired by Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, presented the top award to Zhang Lu's Chinese-Korean co-production <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#graininear">Grain In Ear</A></i>, while Korean independent film <i><A HREF="kfilm05.html#unforgiven">The Unforgiven</A></i> also picked up three awards.

<B>Oct 29:&#160; Korea hosts first Bollywood production</B>&#160;&#160;  The city of Seoul provides the backdrop for the first-ever Bollywood film to shoot in Korea.  <i>Gangster: A Love Story in Korea</i> by veteran director Mahesh Bhatt opened 25 days of shooting on October 29 with a scene taking place during a fireworks display in Han River Citizen's Park.  About 70-80% of the film will take place in Seoul, with the Seoul Film Commission providing logistical assistance.  "We are delighted to be the first to be shooting in Seoul, particularly because the South Korean film industry has become a formidable force in the entertainment arena," says the director. "We have a lot to learn from our Asian brothers rather than from the West. It is this that has prompted us to be the first in India to usher a new dawn in Indo-Korean relations."<p><br>

Although an IMAX screen devoted exclusively to documentaries has operated in Building 63 in Seoul since the 1980s, the new screens will be the first in Korea to show feature films in enhanced 2D and 3D formats.  By 2007, CGV plans to open further screens in Ilsan, Wangshimni, Daegu, and Gwangju.  CGV also announced that the new screens would abide by Korea's Screen Quota system by screening enhanced versions of local films.<p><br>

<B>Dec 7:&#160; Im Kwon-taek's 100th film suspended</B>&#160;&#160;  The opening of shooting for <i>Cheon-nyeon-hak</i>, the 100th film by veteran director Im Kwon-taek (right), was called off on December 7 after losing its main investor.  Lotte Entertainment, which previously agreed to fully finance the feature with the understanding that a major star would be cast in a lead role, pulled out when the star casting fell through.  The situation drew widespread press coverage, calling attention to the fact that even an established director such as Im couldn't attract finance without a star actor.<p><br>


<B>Dec 15:&#160; Korea's first film labor union created</B>&#160;&#160;  The Korean film industry's first ever labor union was officially launched on December 15.  The Federation of Korean Movie Workers' Union opened with an initial 320 members, including assistant directors and crew members in lighting and cinematography.  With a consensus arising among the film industry that the difficult working conditions of crew members needs to be addressed, the union will push to provide such benefits as a minimum wage, overtime pay, and social security to crewmembers.  The union also hopes to introduce legislation protecting workers' rights.  The union was officially recognized by the Ministry of Labor on January 2.

<b><I>Windstruck</i> in Japan:</b>&#160;  Kwak Jae-yong's <I><A HREF="kfilm04.html#windstruck">Windstruck</A></I> (2004) featuring popular star Jeon Ji-hyun set a new record as the most successful Korean film ever released in Japan.  According to distribution company Warner Bros Japan, the film reached the 1.82 billion yen mark (1.37 million admissions) on January 16, vaulting over the 1.8 billion yen earned by <I>Shiri</I> in 2000.  Released on December 11, 2004 on 302 screens (a new record for a Korean film), the film has enjoyed sustained popularity among Japanese viewers, seeing little dropoff at the box-office from week to week.  This reverses a trend of largely disappointing results for Korean films at the Japanese box-office in the past couple years.&#160;&#160; (updated on Jan. 22)<P><br>


<b>50-film retrospective in Paris:</b>&#160;  The Cinematheque Francaise in Paris is holding a 50-film retrospective of Korean cinema from January 5 - February 26.
