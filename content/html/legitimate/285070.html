Is a desire to role-play normal for an adult? Yes.  "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women are merely players."  But our 
everyday theatre does not always provide us with exciting, interesting roles to play.  An ordinary manager, for example, plays
the same dull scenes with his boss and neighbours day, after day, after day without a hope of ever changing it.  He might fit 
much better for a role of noble Galahad or Don Huan, or even a mighty king, who knows?  Everyone, well, at least almost 
everyone has a need to completely change his environment, to live another life once in a while.  Most people just do not 
recognize it as a need, that's all.

The Hobbit Games is one of the main events for CIS live action rpg fans.  If you do not know what
"hobbit" means, (and I hardly could believe in that), you might want to read <I>The Lord of the Rings</I> by J. R. R. Tolkien.  If you want to know more right now, click <A HREF="tolkgold.html">here</A>.
