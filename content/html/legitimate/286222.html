<h1>GURPS: Blue Planet</h1>

This is an unofficial conversion of <a
href="http://www.biohazardgames.com/bp.html">
Biohazard Games'</a> science-fiction roleplaying game <b>Blue
Planet</b> into GURPS.  The reason for the conversion is obvious:
I was extremely impressed with their setting, but rather unimpressed
with the system they provided.  This rather rudimentary conversion
is now obsolescent since an actual GURPS Blue Planet supplement
(which I helped playtest) is on its way.
