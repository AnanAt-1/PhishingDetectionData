ber 20, 1888,  at  3:30  p.  m.,  the  following  members  being  present :  Hon.  John 
Francis,  Hon.  V.  J.  Lane,  Hon.  F.  P.  Baker,  Judge  S.  A.  Kingman,  Hon. 
D.  W.  Wilder,  Hon.  James  Smith,  Maj.  Benjamin  F.  Simpson,  Hon.  James 
F.  Legate,  Hon.  W.  C.  Edwards,  Hon.  E.  J.  Dallas,  Hon.  Martin  Mohler, 
Hon.  T.  D.  Thacher,  and  the  Secretary,  F.  G.  Adams. 

Letters  w^ere  read  from  Hon.  Edward  Russell,  President  of  the  Society, 
and  from  Prof.  I.  T.  Goodnow  and  Hon.  L.  R.  Elliott,  expressing  regrets 
at  their  inability  to  be  present  at  the  meeting. 

The  President  and  Vice-Presidents  being  absent.  Judge  Kingman  was 
called  to  the  chair,  on  motion  of  Hon.  F.  P.  Baker. 

The  Secretary  then  read  the  report,  which  was  approved  on  motion  of 
Mr.  Legate,  and  ordered  for  publication. 

On  motion  of  Mr.  Legate,  it  was  voted  that  a  committee  be  appointed, 
composed  of  three  citizens  of  Topeka,  to  act  in  connection  with  the  Presi- 
dent and  Secretary  of  the  Society,  to  confer  with  the  Executive  Council  and 
the  Legislature,  and  to  take  charge  of  the  matter  of  procuring  suitable  rooms 
in  the  State  House,  when  completed,  for  the  library  and  collections  of  the 
Society.  The  President  appointed  F.  P.  Baker,  T.  D.  Thacher  and  John 
Francis  members  of  the  committee. 

The  Secretary  called  the  attention  of  the  Board  to  a  letter  from  Senator 
Plumb,  transmitting  a  letter  of  Col.  R.  J.  Hinton,  in  which  the  latter  pro- 
poses to  dispose  of  some  historical  manuscripts  and  papers  which  he  has. 
collected.  On  motion,  the  Secretary  was  directed  to  confer  with  Colonel 
Hinton  upon  the  subject. 

On  motion  of  Mr.  Edwards,  the  following  resolution  was  adopted,  and 
ordered  to  be  submitted  to  the  annual  meeting  for  its  consideration : 

Whereas,  The  Kansas  State  Historical  Society  has  always  considered  that  its 
library  and  collections  were  being  gathered  and  made  up  wholly  as  the  property  of 
the  State;  and,  whereas,  the  Legislature,  by  act  of  March  10, 1879,  declared  the  Society 
to  be  a  trustee  of  the  State,  and  its  library  and  collections  of  every  kind  to  be  the 
inalienable  property  of  the  State:  therefore, 

Resolved,  That  this  Society  hereby  formally  declares  it  to  be  the  intention  of  the 
Society,  that  its  library  and  collections  hitherto  gathered,  and  all  that  shall  hereafter 
be  gathered,  are,  and  are  to  become  the  exclusive  property  of  the  State  of  Kansas, 
for  the  use  of  the  people  of  the  State;  and  the  Society  fully  accepts  the  terms  and 
conditions  expressed  and  contained  in  said  act  of  March  10,  1879. 

On  motion,  the  meeting  adjourned.

the  time  for  concluding  the  yearly  work  of  the  Society  and  making  up  the 
annual  report  was  changed  from  the  third  Tuesday  of  January  to  the  third 
Tuesday  in  November.  This  change  was  made  for  the  object  of  giving

sentation to  the  annual  meeting,  and  before  the  meeting  of  the  Legislature. 
The  report  here  presented,  then,  exhibits  the  work  of  the  Society  during 
the  period  commencing  with  January  18th,  1887,  and  ending  with  Novem- 
ber 19th,  1888,  or  about  one  year  and  ten  months,  instead  of  for  the  full 
period  of  two  years,  as  has  been  the  case  with  former  biennial  reports.

The  tables  which  the  report  contains  show  perhaps  as  well  as  tables  and 
exhibits  can,  the  character  and  extent  of  the  work  done  by  the  Society  dur- 
ing the  period  which  the  report  covers. 

Included  in  the  pamphlet  accessions  are  5,393  newspaper  cuttings,  which 
have  been  mounted  and  placed  in  the  library  classification.  These  are  the 
accumulations  of  many  years.  They  relate  chiefly  to  Kansas  history,  local 
and  general,  to  biography,  proceedings  of  local  pioneer  gatherings,  and  of 
various  State  societies  and  associations.  Mounted  in  scrap-books  and  placed 
in  the  library,  they  are  thus  made  convenient  for  reference. 

MENTION  OF  SOME  DONATIONS. 

Among  the  most  liberal  of  the  donors  of  books  and  pamphlets  may  be 
mentioned  Rev.  S.  L.  Adair,  of  Osawatomie;  Hon.  F.  P.  Baker,  Hon.  T.  D. 
Thacher,  Mr.  A.  S.  Huling  and  Hon.  D.  M.  Valentine,  of  Topeka;  Prof 
I.  T.  Goodnow  and  Mrs.  B.  F.  Mudge,  of  Manhattan ;  Hon.  Geo.  W.  Mar- 
tin, Kansas  City ;  Hon.  Eli  Thayer,  of  Worcester,  Massachusetts ;  Dr.  Sam- 
uel A.  Green,  Secretary  of  the  Massachusetts  Historical  Society,  Boston ;  and 
the  Essex  Institute,  Salem,  Massachusetts.  Prof.  Goodnow  has  given  from 
his  thirty-three  years'  savings  in  Kansas  a  mass  of  historical  material  of  in- 
estimable value,  consisting  of  books,  pamphlets,  magazines,  manuscripts, 
maps,  newspaper  files  and  other  papers.  Hon.  D.  M.. Valentine  has  given 
the  Society  ninety-four  pamphlets,  chiefly  consisting  of  Kansas  political  and 
other  publications  thoughtfully  saved  by  him  during  his  thirty  years'  resi- 
dence in  Kansas.  One  of  the  most  valuable  gifts  of  books  to  the  Society  has 
been  that  made  by  Hon.  George  W.  Martin,  now  of  Kansas  City,  Kansas, 
consisting  of  100  copies  of  "  Wilder's  Annals,"  1875  edition.  This  book  has 
been  much  sought  for  by  libraries  and  institutions  with  which  our  Society 
makes  exchanges,  and  the  gift  enables  us  to  effect  exchanges  securing  the 
augmentation  of  our  library  by  many  valuable  volumes  otherwise  beyond 
our  reach. 

Of  the  662  manuscript  papers  contributed,  there  are  many  which  are  of 
historical  interest.  Among  such  may  be  mentioned  the  record  books  of 
early  Topeka  social  organizations,  given  by  Mrs.  Ashbaugh ;  the  muster- 
rolls,  given  by  Judge  L.  D.  Bailey,  containing  a  record  of  the  first  military 
organization  in  what  is  now  Lyon  county ;  Dr.  George  W.  Brown's  contri- 
butions to  anti-slavery  and  early  Kansas  history ;  the  contributions  made  to 
John  Brown  history  by  John  Brown,  jr.,  Theodore  Botkin,  Hon.  Horace  L. 
Jones,  Hon.  O.  E.  Morse,  Col.  William  A.  Phillips,  and  Capt.  J.  A.  Pike ; 
the  autobiographical  sketches  by  lady  editors  of  Kansas  newspapers ;  the 
mass  of  petitions  of  the  women  of  Kansas  for  municipal  suffrage,  presented 
to  the  Legislature  of  1887 ;  and  the  voluminous  original  records  of  Kansas 
history  contained  in  the  contributions  made  by  Mrs.  Lawrence,  the  widow 
of  Amos  A.  Lawrence,  a  most  liberal  benefactor  of  Kansas  in  the  earliest 
days  of  trial.     These  manuscripts  contain  a  large  portion  of  the  records  of

the  work  of  the  New  England  Emigrant  Aid  Company,  of  which  Mr.  Law- 
rence was  the  treasurer. 

Of  maps  and  atlases  donated  to  the  library,  the  atlas  to  accompany  the 
Ohio  Geological  Survey,  given  by  Mr.  Robert  Clarke,  of  Cincinnati,  ac- 
companied as  the  gift  was  by  that  of  the  volumes  of  the  Survey,  is  worthy 
of  special  mention ;  as  is  also  the  gift  by  Mr.  F.  E.  Jerome,  of  Russell,  of 
the  atlas  to  accompany  the  Michigan  Geological  Survey.  Mr.  John  P.  Ed- 
wards, of  Quincy,  Illinois,  has  added 'to  the  gifts  before  made  by  him  of 
Kansas  maps  and  atlases,  by  contributing  large  wall  maps  of  three  Kansas 
and  one  Missouri  county.  Professor  Goodnow's  very  large  gift  to  the  So- 
ciety was  acccompanied  by  eighteen  valuable  maps.  The  gift  made  by  J. 
H.  Meacham  of  his  voluminous  illustrated  atlas  of  Brown  and  Nemaha 
counties  is  an  important  contribution  to  the  materials  of  Kansas  history. 
The  Iowa  atlas  given  by  Mr.  A.  W.  Stubbs  is  a  valuable  record  of  the  history 
of  a  neighboring  State.  Messrs.  Wasser  and  Flint,  of  Girard,  have  added 
again  to  their  contributions  of  Kansas  maps.  Mr.  Henry  Kuhn's  gift  of 
Boudinot's  map  of  the  Indian  Territory  is  an  important  contribution. 
Rand,  McNally  &amp;  Co.  have  added  largely  to  the  gifts  which  they  had  be- 
fore made  of  maps  of  the  States  and  Territories.  The  archaeological  map 
made  and  given  to  the  Society  by  Mr.  William  Griffing  is  an  interesting 
record  of  original  investigation  of  the  antiquities  of  Kansas. 

Noteworthy  among  the  pictures  added  to  the  gallery  is  a  crayon  portrait 
of  Senator  Ingalls,  a  gift  of  the  artist,  Mr.  A.  Montgomery ;  a  crayon  por- 
trait of  Col.  Alexander  S.  Johnson,  given  by  himself  by  special  request ; 
and  a  portrait  of  Chester  Thomas,  sr,,  given  by  members  of  his  family. 
Mr.  Robert  Tracy,  of  St.  Joseph,  Mo.,  has  given  photo  portraits  of  Maj. 
William  P.  Richardson  and  Dr.  John  H.  Stringfellow,  both  prominent 
figures  in  the  earliest  period  of  Kansas  Territorial  history ;  the  family  and 
friends  of  Prof.  B.  F.  Mudge  have  given  a  portrait  of  that  most  prominent 
early  worker  in  Kansas  science;  Thomas  W.  Heatley  has  given  an  original 
photo  portrait  of  Richard  Realf,  and  a  fine  crayon  copy  of  this  portrait  has 
been  given  the  Society  by  Mrs.  Peacock,  who  executed  it;  H.  T.  Martin, 
the  photographer,  has  contributed  cabinet  photos  of  members  of  the  Legis- 
lature and  the  executive  officers  of  1887-8, 136  in  number.  Numerous  other 
portraits  and  pictures  have  also  been  contributed  to  the  Society's  very  large 
collection  of  this  class  of  historical  material.  Ex-Gov.  Frederick  P.  Stanton, 
now  a  resident  of  Farmwell,  Virginia,  has  given  the  Society  a  fine  marble 
bust  of  himself,  executed  many  years  ago  by  Horatio  Stone.  This  gift  will 
ever  be  regarded  by  the  Society  and  by  the  people  of  Kansas  as  an  inter- 
esting memorial  of  one  whose  official  career  was  marked  by  invaluable 
services  in  times  of  great  need. 

Conspicuous  among  the  contributions  is  the  gold  medal  w^hich  was  pre- 
sented by  Victor  Hugo'and  his  associates  in  France,  in  1874,  to  the  widow 
of  Capt.  John  Brown,  in  testimony  of  the  recognition  by  the  donors  of  the 


Sixth  biennial  Report.  9 


supreme  sacrifice  made  by  the  Kansas  martyr  in  behalf  of  human  rdghts. 
The  medal  has  been  deposited  with  the  Historical  Society  by  Capt.  John 
Brown,  jr.,  and  his  brothers  and  sisters,  regarding  as  they  do  our  Society 
as  the  appropriate  custodian  of  the  memorials  of  their  illustrious  father. 

Of  war  memorials  may  be  mentioned  the  gift  by  Maj.  James  B.  Abbott  of 
his  sword,  a  relic  of  the  early  troubles  in  Kansas,  as  well  as  of  the  war  of  the 
Kebellion,  also  the  gift  by  the  same  of  an  English  musket,  a  relic  of  Confed- 
erate arms  employed  on  our  border  in  Price's  raid,  and  a  Pro-Slavery  flag,  a 
relic  of  the  Kansas  Territorial  troubles ;  the  gift  by  Mrs.  Hannah  Ritchie 
of  the  sword  and  gun  of  Gen.  John  Ritchie,  memorials  of  the  services  ren- 
dered by  a  distinguished  and  honored  pioneer  citizen  of  Kansas  in  the  w^ar 
for  the  preservation  of  the  Union.  Hon.  A.  Washburn  gives  an  interesting 
relic  of  the  war  of  the  Revolution,  and  Dr.  S.  B.  Prentiss  the  same  of  the 
Pro-Slavery  troubles  of  1856.  Interesting  relics  of  the  war  of  the  Rebellion 
have  been  given  by  Mrs.  Lititia  Watkins,  Mr.  W.  A.  Warren,  J.  W.  Rich- 
ardson, W.  E.  Richey,  and  Mrs.  Sophia  Ashbaugh. 

Of  files  of  newspapers.  Rev.  S.  L.  Adair  has  given  thirty-six  volumes, 
Hon.  F.  P.  Baker  sixteen,  and  Prof.  I.  T.  Goodnow  sixty-two.  These  with 
the  others  contributed  swell  the  number  of  files  given  the  Society  in  addi- 
tion to  those  contributed  in  regular  issues,  to  one  hundred  and  twenty-eight 
in  number.  These  added  to  the  volumes  of  newspapers  and  periodicals  which 
have  accumulated  through  regular  newspaper  issues  received,  chiefly  from 
gifts,  make  up  1,995  volumes  of  this  most  valuable  class  of  historical  ma- 
terials received  during  the  period  covered  by  the  report. 

CHARACTER  OF    THE   LIBRARY. 

The  lists  and  tables  which  this  report  contains  show  that  there  is  being 
made  up  by  this  Society  for  the  use  of  the  people  of  Kansas  a  library  of 
history  and  reference,  remarkable  in  its  growth,  and  still  more  remarkable 
in  the  character  and  value  of  the  materials  which  it  contains.  They  show 
that  notwithstanding  much  embarrassment  the  growth  of  the  library  and 
collections  has  steadily  continued  from  year  to  year  during  the  thirteen 
years  of  the  Society's  existence,  and  that  in  that  time  there  have  been  placed 
on  the  library  shelves  more  than  forty-eight  thousand  volumes  of  books, 
newspaper  files  and  pamphlets ;  and  in  addition  to  these,  this  and  former  re- 
ports show  a  collection  of  manuscripts,  pictures,  statuary,  relics  and  objects 
of  historical  illustration  of  every  kind  and  description  almost  countless  in 
number. 

The  character  of  these  materials  is  such  as  was  contemplated  in  the  or- 
ganization of  the  Society  and  such  as  the  law  directs  the  Society  to  bring 
into  its  library  and  collections.  They  are  chiefly  the  printed  and  written 
records  of  the  people  of  Kansas;  records  which  go  to  show  the  sacrifices 
and  achievements  of  our  first  settlers  in  establishing  freedom  on  our  soil ; 
records  of  the  daily,  weekly,  monthly  and  yearly  transactions  of  the  people 


10  STATE  HISTOBICAL  SOCIETY. 

in  social,  moral,  educational  and  material  progress;  in  the  building-up  of 
our  towns,  with  their  depots  of  trade,  their  manufactories,  and  varied  in- 
dustrial establishments ;  records  which  show  the  unexampled  progress  in  the 
construction  of  lines  of  railroad  transportation ;  in  the  opening  and  plant- 
ing of  farms,  orchards  and  vineyards;  records  of  the  march,  year  by  year, 
of  our  frontier  people  toward  the  border,  still  experimenting  with  the  powers 
of  nature,  and  still  subduing  obstacles  which  for  all  the  ages  before  had 
been  deemed  insurmountable.  The  history  of  the  struggles  and  triumphs 
of  the  people  of  Kansas,  from  the  earliest  day  to  the  present,  have  been 
and  are  being  more  fully  recorded  by  pen  and  printing-press  than  ever  be- 
fore was  that  of  any  people ;  and  our  Historical  Society  is  very  fully  gather- 
ing in  and  placing  accessibly  on  its  shelves  the  record  as  thus  being  made 
up.  The  published  statistics  of  the  libraries  of  the  country  show  that  the 
library  of  the  Kansas  Historical  Society  is  the  largest  historical  library 
west  of  the  Mississippi  river,  and  the  largest  but  one  west  of  the  Alleghany 
Mountains.  When  it  is  considered  that  this  library  is  not  composed  of 
evanescent  books  of  the  literature  of  the  day,  written  and  printed  for  the 
amusement  of  the  hour,  and  then  no  longer  sought  for  reference  or  for  any 
other  use,  but  that  it  chiefly  contains  the  original  records  of  the  facts  in 
the  history  of  our  own  pioneer  people,  of  the  first  generation  of  the  founders 
and  builders  of  the  State,  it  may  be  well  said  that  when  we  speak  of  its 
remarkable  growth  in  the  number  of  its  volumes,  we  present  a  feature  of 
but  slight  consideration  compared  with  that  of  the  character  of  the  volumes 
which  it  contains  as  original  materials  of  history. 

And  not  only  is  the  history  of  our  own  people  being  gathered  into  this 
library,  but  as  the  law  directs,  the  library  is  being  made  one  of  very  widely 
extended  reference,  in  general  history,  in  science,  and  in  all  subjects  of 
social,  educational,  and  literary  research. 

RELATION  OF  THE  SOCIETY  TO  THE  STATE. 

The  kind  of  work  being  done  by  the  Society,  and  the  relation  which  it  sus- 
tains to  the  State,  are  peculiar;  hence  the  duties  imposed,  and  the  privileges 
conferred  upon  it  by  law,  are  not  so  well  understood  as  they  should  be.  There 
is  but  one  other  institution  in  the  country  so  nearly  like  this  in  object  and 
scope,  and  in  its  connection  with  the  State,  as  to  admit  of  comparison.  The 
Wisconsin  Historical  Society  is  much  like  ours,  and  afforded  the  model 
upon  which  our  work  in  its  incipiency  was  planned  and  in  the  main  has 
since  been  carried  forward.  Both  are  voluntary  associations.  Their  mem- 
bers and  officers  are  private  citizens  elected  by  the  societies.  Their  mode  of 
work  has  been  devised,  and  is  being  carried  forward  upon  plans,  rules  and 
regulations  made  by  themselves.  But  what  they  do  is  for  the  people  of  the 
State.  Their  library  and  all  their  collections  are  the  property  of  the  State, 
placed  in  rooms  provided  by  the  State,  and  are  inalienable  and  irremovable. 
The  expenses  of  the  work  of  the  Society  are  chiefly  defrayed  by  the  State. 


Sixth  Biennial  Re  poet.  11 


This  relation  of  the  State  Historical  Society  to  the  State  is  essential  to  the 
existence  of  a  historical  society  in  a  new  State  where  there  are  no  opulent 
citizens  to  found  and  maintain  such  a  society.  So  far  as  there  has  been  any 
experience  in  such  work,  it  is  the  relation  best  calculated  to  secure  the 
making  up  of  a  public  historical  collection  in  any  State ;  a  work  which  it  is 
everywhere  conceded  every  State  should  have  by  some  means  done  for  it, 
and  the  neglect  of  which  is  greatly  deplored  where  it  has  been  left  undone. 
Such  a  society  is  greatly  stimulated  to  exertion  to  fulfill  the  public  require- 
ments. Where  by  law  the  society  is  made  the  trustee  and  servant  of  the 
State  its  work  is  not  perfunctory  like  that  of  the  State  official,  whose 
term  of  service  is  determined  upon  political  considerations.  The  existence 
of  the  Society  and  its  continued  support  are  dependent  upon  its  fulfillment 
of  the  public  demand  and  expectation  year  by  year  and  continually.  This 
has  been  and  must  ever  be  the  experience  of  such  a  relation  to  the  State  of 
a  voluntary  association  of  this  character. 

LEGAL  REQUIREMENTS. 

The  act  of  the  Legislature  of  1879,  by  which  the  Society  was  made  the  trus- 
tee of  the  State  and  its  collections  the  property  of  the  State,  makes  it  the 
•duty  of  the  Society  to  make  up  a  library  of  "  books,  maps  and  other  materials 
illustrative  of  the  history  of  Kansas  in  particular  and  the  West  generally ; 
.  .  .  to  purchase  books  to  supply  deficiencies  in  the  various  departments 
of  its  collections,  and  to  procure  by  gift  and  exchange  such  scientific  and 
historical  reports  of  the  Legislatures  of  other  States,  of  railroads,  reports  of 
geological  and  other  scientific  surveys,  and  such  other  books,  maps,  charts 
and  materials  as  will  facilitate  the  investigation  of  historical,  scientific,  so- 
cial, educational  and  literary  subjects,  and  to  cause  the  same  to  be  properly 
bound ;  to  catalog  the  collections  of  the  said  Society  for  the  more  convenient 
reference  of  all  persons  who  may  have  occasion  to  consult  the  same ;  to  bi- 
ennially prepare  for  publication  a  report  of  its  collections  and  such  other 
matter  relating  to  its  transactions  as  may  be  useful  to  the  public;  and  to 
keep  its  collections  arranged  in  convenient  and  suitable  rooms,  to  be  pro- 
vided and  furnished  by  the  Secretary  of  State,  as  the  Board  of  Directors 
shall  determine." 

Considering  the  novelty  of  such  a  relation  of  a  State  to  an  association  of 
its  private  citizens,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  duties  thus  imposed  by  the 
State  and  the  compensation  given  for  performing  them  should  not  for  a 
time  be  properly  adjusted.  The  Society  has  not  been  in  the  habit  of  com- 
plaining of  lack  of  appreciation  and  compensation ;  for  the  public  appre- 
ciation has  always  and  everywhere  been  made  most  manifest,  and  the  Society 
has  always  been  confident  that  the  lack  of  adequate  means  for  carrying  on 
its  work  would  prove  to  be  but  temporary.  The  membership  of  the  Society 
now  extends  to  every  county  in  the  State.  The  most  valuable  part  of  the 
current  accessions  to  its  library,  namely  the  newspaper  issues,  and  locally 


12  STATE  HISTOBIGAL  SOCIETY. 


printed  matter,  are  being  freely  contributed  by  members  of  the  Society, 
from  every  county  in  the  State.  The  faithful  performance  of  the  most  im- 
portant part  of  its  work,  that  of  caring  for  these  local  contributions,  employs 
more  than  half  the  time  of  the  clerical  force  of  the  Society.  It  is  not  to  be 
supposed  that  a  society  whose  work  is  being  done  wholly  for  the  people  of 
the  State,  whose  working  membership  embraces  every  part  of  the  State,  and 
the  results  of  whose  work  have  come  to  be  appreciated  by  all  classes  of  in- 
telligent people  in  the  State,  will  remain  for  a  much  longer  period  in  a  state 
of  embarrassment  for  want  of  means  to  carry  forward  the  work  assigned  to  it. 

BROAD   FIELD  OF  WORK. 

The  duty  imposed  by  the  Legislature  upon  the  Society  to  place  in  it&amp; 
library  with  the  publications  of  our  own  State,  those  of  other  States  and 
those  of  learned,  social  and  scientific  institutions  generally,  so  as  to  make 
up  a  library  which  shall  give  every  citizen  of  the  State  facilities  for  the  in- 
vestigation of  "historical,  social,  educational  and  literary  subjects,"  are  so 
comprehensive  that  its  library  undertaking  may  be  said  to  be  unlimited  in 
its  object  and  scope. 

The  broad  field  from  which  the  materials  of  this  library  are  being  gathered 
has  proven  to  be  a  very  fruitful  one.  While  our  best  garnerings  are  from 
within  our  own  State,  the  limits  of  the  work  of  the  Society  are  boundless. 
So  interwoven  has  been  the  history  of  Kansas  with  that  of  the  principal 
events  of  the  whole  country,  and  so  much  has  the  work  of  the  Society 
enlisted  a  general  interest,  its  library  has  come  to  be  the  recipient,  largely 
by  gift,  of  not  only  the  materials  of  the  history  of  the  whole  country,  but 
of  everything  of  a  literary  and  scientific  character  relating  to  all  parts  of 
the  country.  The  library  is  becoming,  at  a  cost  involving  little  more  than 
that  of  freight  and  postage,  care  and  keeping,  a  library  of  reference  very 
broad  in  its  scope.  Its  growth  would  be  far  more  rapid,  and  its  accessi- 
bility and  consequent  usefulness  to  the  public  would  be  far  greater,  were 
adequate  means  given  the  Society  to  employ  a  suflicient  clerical  force,  and 
if  the  State  had  been  able  to  fulfill  its  undertaking  to  furnish  "suitable  and 
convenient  rooms  for  the  collections." 

The  State  of  Kansas  in  legalizing  the  work  of  the  State  Historical  Soci- 
ety and  giving  such  a  breadth  and  scope  to  the  objects  aimed  to  be  accom- 
plished by  it,  intended  no  half-way  work.  The  action  of  the  Legislature 
was  prompted  by  the  conviction  which  has  always  rested  in  the  minds  of 
our  people,  that  Kansas  has  made  and  is  making  a  history  unique  in  its 
character  and  unparalleled  in  the  magnitude  of  the  principles  which  had 
been  and  are  being  vindicated  and  exemplified  on  our  soil.  The  materials 
of  our  own  history,  and  of  our  world-wide  related  history,  are  such  as  no 
State  ever  before  had  spread  out  for  the  gathering. 

And  the  willing  helpers  in  the  work  are  as  widespread  as  are  the  mate- 
rials.    The  interest  in  the  work  of  the  Kansas  Historical  Spciety  is  as  broad 


Sixth  biennial  Repobt.  13 


as  the  country  itself.  Said  the  Secretary  of  the  Massachusetts  Historical 
Society:  "Massachusetts  helped  to  redeem  and  make  Kansas, —  it  will  help 
its  Historical  Society."  Said  Henry  Ward  Beecher  in  accepting  a  mem- 
bership in  our  Society :  "  I  need  not  say  how  deep  an  interest  I  have  taken 
in  her  noble  progress  and  renowned  prosperity.  She  well  deserves  the  title 
'New  England  of  the  AVest.' "  Said  William  Lloyd  Garrison  :  "The  for- 
mation of  such  a  society  is  cause  for  special  congratulation,  and  an  event  of 
historical  importance  far  beyond  the  limits  of  the  State;  —  for  there  is  noth- 
ing more  thrilling  in  American  history  than  the  struggle  to  secure  freedom 
and  free  institutions  to  Kansas  —  a  struggle  which,  if  it  had  terminated 
otherwise  than  it  did,  would  have  been  fraught  with  appalling  consequences 
not  only  to  the  State  itself,  but  to  the  whole  country.  How  different  would 
have  been  the  fate  of  Kansas,  if  slavery  had  been  successfully  established 
upon  her  soil !  Under  the  plastic  hand  of  freedom,  how  astonishing  has  been 
her  growth  in  intelligence,  industry,  enterprise,  population,  and  material 
prosperity ;  and  at  the  present  time  what  strides  she  is  making  in  develop- 
ing her  ample  resources,  and  how  irresistible  is  the  magnetism  by  which  she 
is  drawing  to  herself  from  all  quarters  a  mighty  immigration  that  can 
scarcely  fail  to  place  her,  ere  long,  in  the  front  rank  of  States.  This  is  her 
fitting  recompense  for  having  gone  through  a  baptism  of  blood  and  an 
ordeal  of  fire  with  such  firmness  and  devotion  to  the  sacred  cause  of  free- 
dom. May  her  *  peace  be  as  a  river,'  and  her  *  prosperity  as  the  waves  of 
the  sea.' " 

It  is  in  the  preservation  of  the  materials  of  the  history  of  the  growth  and 
development  of  Kansas  during  the  past  thirteen  years  that  the  work  of  the 
Society  is  most  complete  and  comprehensive.  Before  our  Society  had  begun 
its  work,  the  printed  materials  of  the  history  of  the  earlier  days  had  in 
large  part  been  dissipated  and  destroyed.  The  materials  of  the  present 
day,  as  they  are  daily  and  weekly  being  issued  from  more  than  a  thousand 
busy  printing-presses,  are  all  being  saved  in  the  library  of  our  Society.  In 
its  growth  and  development  Kansas  has  gone  forward  until  \\  has  reached, 
with  all  the  appliances  of  the  best  civilization  the  world  has  ever  known, 
the  remotest  boundaries  of  our  State;  and  now  are  to  be  found  newspaper 
presses  in  every  county.  These  papers  make  a  record,  w^eek  by  week,  of  all 
the  events  occurring  in  the  growth  of  these  new  counties,  and  complete  files 
of  all  are  being  preserved  in  the  library  of  the  State  Historical  Society,  the 
gift  of  their  generous  and  thoughtful  publishers. 

PROVINCE   OF  A  HISTORICAL   SOCIETY. 

That  the  Kansas  State  Historical  Society  is  well  fulfilling  the  mission 
assigned  it  by  the  Legislature,  and  according  to  the  highest  standards  es- 
tablished for  an  institution  charged  by  a  State  with  the  duty  of  forming  a 
library  of  historical  and  other  materials  for  the  use  of  the  people,  may  be 
quoted  here  a  single  testimonial  as  to  what  ought  to  be  done  for  the  accom- 


14  STATE  HI8T0BICAL  SOCIETY. 

plishment  of  such  object.  It  is  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Henry  A.  Homes,  who 
for  forty  years,  and  till  his  death  a  few  months  since,  was  the  eminent  libra- 
rian of  the  general  library  of  the  State  of  New  York.  It  is  found  in  an 
article  prepared  by  him  contained  in  the  United  States  Government  publi- 
cation entitled,  "Public  Libraries  in  the  United  States  of  America;  their 
History,  Condition,  and  Management,"  published  by  the  Department  of  the 
Interior,  in  1876.  In  a  paragraph  in  which  he  makes  a  statement  of  the 
special  province  of  a  general  State  library,  as  distinct  and  separate  from 
that  of  a  library  of  law  reports,  statutes,  journals  of  the  Legislature,  and 
State  documents,  he  says : 

"A  State  library  will,  of  course,  make  it  one  of  its  special  aims  to  collect  works  of 
American  history  in  general  just  so  far  as  the  means  at  its  disposal  will  admit.  But 
of  all  the  purposes  for  which  it  exists,  none  respond  so  directly  to  the  wants  of  the 
largest  number  of  the  citizens  of  a  State  as  to  aim  to  collect  all  the  materials  access- 
ible to  illustrate* the  history  of  the  State,  its  counties,  its  towns,  and  its  citizens. 
The  authorities  of  the  library  will  therefore  be  attentive  to  secure  all  local  histories 
and  biographies,  manuscript  collections  of  the  papers  of  its  eminent  citizens,  the 
official  proceedings  of  all  counties  and  towns,  reports  of  all  societies,  charitable, 
commercial,  manufacturing,  military  and  secret,  and  as  many  of  the  newspapers 
printed  in  the  State  as  can  be  obtained,  with  its  almanacs,  and  business  and  town 
directories.  To  these  will  naturally  be  added  works  in  science  and  the  arts  which 
relate  more  particularly  to  the  productions  of  the  State.  An  honorable  historic 
consciousness  will  be  promoted  by  securing  works  of  merit  of  all  kinds  written  by 
citizens  of  the  State." 

NEWSPAPERS  AS  MATERIALS  OF  HISTORY. 

The  following  is  quoted  from  the  same  high  authority : 

"Much  might  be  said  regarding  the  value  of  the  different  classes  of  books  just 
mentioned,  a  value  which  grows  with  successive  years.  We  will,  however,  single  out 
from  among  them  for  particular  notice  the  class  of  newspapers.  For  many  towns 
and  counties  they  are  the  only  printed  record  of  the  earliest  facts  of  local  history. 
Their  value  in  libraries  is  already  recognized  in  our  Western  States.  The  Indiana 
State  Library  receives  twenty-eight  newspapers  as  an  annual  gift;  Minnesota  was 
receiving  forty  in  1862;  and  Ohio  received  twenty-eight.  The  New  Jersey  Library 
invites  donations  of  the  same  kind.  There  can  be  little  doubt  that  the  publishers 
of  a  large  proportion  of  the  newspapers  of  any  State  would  preserve  and  give  to  the 
State  the  file  of  each  year,  on  the  single  condition  that  it  should  be  promptly  bound 
and  be  made  accessible  to  the  public.  It  would  be  equitable  and  useful  to  provide 
by  statute  that  each  publisher  sending  a  newspaper  should  receive  a  copy  of  the  laws 
of  the  session." 

This  eminent  librarian  singles  out  from  among  the  most  important  of  all 
the  subjects  of  collection  the  local  newspaper.  And  yet  what  a  meager 
showing  he  makes  as  to  what  the  State  libraries  of  the  country  were  twelve 
years  ago  doing  in  this  department  of  work :  Indiana,  twenty-eight  news- 
papers; Minnesota,  forty;  Ohio,  twenty -eight.  And  they  are  doing  no 
better  to-day.  State  libraries  never  have  effectively  done  the  most  appro- 
priate work  for  a  library  of  local  history  and  general  reference  for  the 


Sixth  Biennial  Repobt.  15 

people.     They  have  a  paramount  object  besides,  and  to  that  their  chief 
work  is  naturally  and  necessarily  confined. 

It  was  left  to  the  voluntary  associations  of  private  citizens  forming  the 
Wisconsin  Historical  Society  and  the  Kansas  Historical  Society,  to  prop- 
erly inaugurate  and  carry  forward  this  kind  of  work.  The  board  of  direct- 
ors of  the  Wisconsin  Historical  Society  at  their  annual  meeting  in  January 
last,  reported  as  contained  in  their  library,  5,240  volumes  of  newspaper 
files;  and  to  this  class  of  library  materials  they  particularly  refer  as  being 
"the  fountain-head  of  modern  history." 

SPIRIT  OF  THE   KANSAS   PRESS. 

The  New  York  State  Librarian  suggested  that  publishers  should  be  com- 
pensated for  their  newspapers.  That  might  do  for  New  York,  Indiana,  and 
Ohio.  But  Kansas  newspaper  publishers  see  the  matter  in  a  different  light ;  it 
was  they  who  organized  the  Society,  and  no  sooner  was  it  organized  than  they 
began  freely  to  give  their  regular  issues.  Not  only  that,  but  the  veteran 
editor  who  had  published  his  paper  from  away  back  in  the  eari^ly  history  of 
Kansas  Territory  got  together  his  scattered  duplicates  until  he  had  made  up 
for  the  Society  a  complete  file,  not  a  number  missing.  At  least  one  file  thus 
given  we  have,  covering  a  period  now  of  more  than  thirty  years.  So  the 
publisher  of  the  newspaper  starting  in  a  frontier  county,  hearing  of  the  work 
our  Society  is  doing,  of  which  he  is  pretty  sure  to  hear  even  before  his  first 
issue  is  out,  with  alacrity  puts  the  State  Historical  Society  on  his  mail 
book.  Thus  the  work  of  the  newspaper  man's  enterprise,  zeal  and  ambi- 
tion goes  to  posterity.  And  who  shall  say  that  he  will  not  do  better  work; 
more  for  the  good  of  the  people  a  history  of  whose  doings  he  records,  than 
if  he  felt  that  the  issues  from  his  press  were  but  for  a  day,  speedily  to  pass 
from  the  face  of  the  earth  as  has  been  the  common  experience  where  no  his- 
torical society  has  existed  to  save  the  issues  of  the  press  and  place  them 
between  fire-proof  walls  built  by  the  State  for  the  preservation  of  its  sacred 
archives.  The  newspaper  men  and  women  of  Kansas  are  putting  it  in  the 
power  of  the  Historical  Society  which  they  founded  to  do  better  work  in 
making  up  a  library  of  the  best  materials  of  local  history  than  is  being 
done  by  any  other  society  or  institution  in  the  world. 

That  the  publishers  of  Kansas  newspapers  appreciate  the  work  being 
done  by  the  Historical  Society  which  they  established,  a  single  quotation 
may  be  given  from  among  hundreds.    Says  the  editor  of  a  leading  daily : 

"This  Society,  as  its  name  implies,  is  the  custodian  and  conservator  of  the  his- 
tory of  Kansas.  A  copy  of  almost  every  newspaper  published  in  this  State,  from 
its  organization,  and  prior  to  that  period,  through  its  earliest  Territorial  days,  may 
be  found  on  tile  in  its  rooms.  From  that  established  in  1854  down  to  the  journals 
of  to-day,  a  copy  of  each  is  there  carefully  preserved,  thus  making  a  continuous 
and  unbroken  history  of  the  State  to-day.  A  copy  of  every  book  written,  by  Kan- 
sans,  may  be  found  on  its  shelves;  so  of  thousands  of  foreign  newspapers  and 
pamphlets;  and  all  the  addresses  and  speeches  embodying  matters  relating  to  Kan- 


16  STATE  HISTOBICAL  SOCIETY 


sas  affairs  are  there  compiled  and  sto^ved  away.  A  copy  of  each  annual  Agricultural 
Report,  which,  by  the  way,  are  the  fullest,  completest,  and  most  accurate  reports  of  the 
kind  prepared  by  any  State  in  the  Union,  is  there  preserved.  Copies  of  the  pro- 
ceedings of  every  Legislature  and  every  State  convention,  a  record  of  the  minutes 
of  every  important  public  gathering  ever  held  in  Kansas,  are  kept  there.  The  walls 
and  cases  of  this  office  are  adorned  with  portraits  of  Governors  of  Kansas,  of  many 
other  historial  characters,  and  of  the  various  Territorial  and  State  Legislatures. 
Glass  cases  arranged  about  the  rooms  contain  Kansas  relics  of  all  sorts,  conveniently 
placed.  In  short,  everything  of  an  historical  character  is  being  gathered  up  and 
consigned  to  its  proper  place  in  the  archives  of  this  Society. 

"  The  value  of  our  State  Historical  Society,  aside  from  its  general  purposes,  as 
the  custodian  of  Kansas  history,  as  an  aid  in  litigation,  can  hardly  be  overestimated. 
A  prominent  attorney  of  this  city  a  few  years  ago,  in  an  important  patent  case, 
found  himself  compelled  to  establish  a  certain  date  and  fact  vital  to  his  client.  He 
searched  high  and  low,  far  and  near,  without  avail.  At  last  it  occurred  to  him  that 
he  might  at  least  get  a  clue  from  the  State  Historical  Society.  He  went  to  Topeka 
and  was  handed  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Society  the  public  directory  containing  the 
very  date  and  fact  he  needed. 

"The  men  who  organized  this  Society  builded  better  than  they  knew.  Their 
efforts  to  maintain  it  through  all  these  years  have  already  been  amply  rewarded  in 
the  practical  as  well  as  sentimental  benefit  it  has  conferred  upon  the  citizens  of 
Kansas,  and  the  appropriations  made  by  the  Legislature  for  its  support  have  been 
among  the  best  investments  the  State  has  ever  made.  Its  utility  will  be  more  appre- 
ciated from  year  to  year,  and  long  after  its  projectors  and  present  patrons  have 
passed  from  the  stage  of  action,  its  work  and  accumulations  will  abide  among  the 
most  cherished  possessions  of  the  Kansans  who  are  to  be." 

THE  WORK  EXCEEDS  THE  MEANS. 

The  law  makes  it  the  duty  of  the  Society  to  catalog  this  library.  This 
calls  for  consideration  the  subject  of  the  long-continued  embarrassment  of 
the  Society  for  want  of  adequate  appropriations  by  the  Legislature  to  carry 
on  its  work,  a  subject  which  has  been  repeatedly  presented  before  in  these 
reports.  The  present  very  poorly  paid  clerical  force  is  insufficient  to  prop- 
erly perform  the  current  work  of  the  Society,  which  has  hitherto  been 
necessarily  confined  to  that  of  gathering  in  the  accumulations,  making  a  rec- 
ord of  them,  having  them  bound,  classifying  and  arranging  them  on  the 
shelves,  acknowledging  gifts,  and  conducting  the  very  extensive  correspond- 
ence involved  in  reaching  out  for  material,  widely  scattered  as  are  the 
people  who  have  for  manifest  causes  had  connection  with  the  events  of 
Kansas  history  from  the  earliest  days.  It  has  thus  far  been  impossible  to 
comply  with  the  requirement  to  catalog  the  library.  The  meager  appro- 
priations have  Compelled  the  payment  to  the  clerks  employed  of  less  than 
one-half  the  amount  paid  to  employes  in  other  departments  of  the  State. 
Double  the  amount  should  be  paid  to  present  employes,  and  an  additional 
force  should  be  employed.  The  scanty  provision  made  by  the  State  to  ena- 
ble the  Society  to  perform  its  work  has  no  precedent  in  the  legislation  of 
any  State.  While  Kansas  gives  $4,250  to  its  Historical  Society,  Wisconsin 
has  for  many  years  given  annually  more  than  $9,000.

LACK   OF  ROOM. 

The  present  embarrassment  of  the  Society  for  lack  of  room  for  its  collec- 
tions, and  the  urgent  demand  at  this  time  that  provision  shall  be  made  in 
the  State  Capitol  when  completed  for  the  future  needs  of  this  library,  must 
again  be  mentioned. 

The  law,  as  has  been  quoted,  has  made  it  the  duty  of  the  Secretary  of 
State  to  furnish  convenient  and  suitable  rooms  for  the  library  and  collec- 
tions, such  as  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Society  shall  determine.  Of 
course  it  has  been  thus  far  out  of  the  power  of  the  Secretary  of  State  or 
any  other  authority  to  comply  with  this  requirement  in  the  uncompleted 
state  of  the  Capitol  building.  But  in  view  of  the  progress  being  made 
toward  the  completion  of  the  Capitol,  at  the  annual  meeting  two  years  ago, 
the  Board  presented  the  subject  in  its  report  to  the  Society,  and,  during  the 
session  of  the  Legislature  following,  a  conference  was  held  between  the  legis- 
lative committee  of  the  Society  and  the  joint  committee  of  the  Legislature 
on  the  State  Library,  to  whom  the  Governor's  recommendation,  that  proper 
legislation  should  be  had  for  the  maintenance  of  the  work  of  the  Society, 
had  been  referred.  The  committee  of  the  Legislature  responded  to  the 
wishes  of  our  committee,  and  the  following  concurrent  resolution  was  intro- 
duced by  the  committee  in  the  House  of  Representatives,  and  was  adopted : 

House  Conoubkent  Resolution  No.  22,  1887. —  "5e  it  resolved  by  the  House  of 
.  Representatives,  the  Senate  concurring  therein,  That  the  State  House  Commissioners 
be,  and  they  are  hereby  instructed,  that  in  the  preparation  of  the  plan  of  the  main 
building  of  the  State  House,  and  in  the  assignment  of  rooms,  ample  provision  be 
made  for  the  valuable  collections  of  historical  material  of  the  State  Historical 
Society,  and  for  its  future  growth." 

When  the  resolution  came  before  the  Senate  it  failed  to  pass.  A  com- 
mittee has  been  appointed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  to  confer  with  the 
Executive  Council  and  the  Legislature  in  relation  to  rooms  for  the  library 
and  collections  of  the  Society  in  the  Capitol  when  completed. 

SOCIETY'S  SEAL. 

During  last  year,  at  the  suggestion  of  President  Wilder,  an  engraved  seal 
for  the  Society's  use,  with  a  design  deemed  appropriate,  was  procured  to  be 
made  in  Washington,  through  the  kind  offices  of  Senator  Plumb.  The 
design  combines  the  seal  of  the  State  of  Kansas,  with  the  coats  of  arms  of 
France  and  Spain  at  the  periods  of  the  sovereignty  of  those  powers  over 
Louisiana  Territory,  of  which  the  territory  within  the  bounds  of  Kansas 
formed  a  part. 

ADDRESSES   BEFORE    THE    SOCIETY. 

At  the  annual  meeting,  January  17,  1888,  addresses  were  delivered  by 
the  following  persons : 

Hon.  D.  W.  Wilder  delivered  the  annual  address,  briefly  sketching  the 


18  STATE  Historical  Society. 

history  of  the  Society.  Other  addresses  were  delivered  upon  subjects  per- 
taining to  Kansas  history,  as  follows : 

Prof  I.  T.  Goodnow,  Manhattan,  Personal  Reminiscences,  being  an 
account  of  the  founding  of  Manhattan  by  a  New  England  Emigrant  Aid 
party  in  1855,  of  which  party  Prof  Goodnow  was  the  leader. 

Hbn.  S.  A.  Kingman,  Topeka,  on  the  Growth  and  Development  of 
Kansas. 

Prof.  W.  H.  Carruth,  Lawrence,  on  the  subject  of  the  Origin  of  Kansas 
Geographical  Names. 

C.  A.  Hiller,  Esq.,  Salina,  on  the  Padouacas,  and  other  Aboriginal  Tribes 
of  Kansas. 

C.  F.  Scott,  Tola,  on  the  subject  of  the  Pioneer  Press  of  Kansas. 

Hon.  H.  N.  Lester,  Syracuse,  on  the  Colonization  of  the  Upper  Arkansas 
Valley  in  Kansas. 

Hon.  J.  Ware  Butterfield,  Florence,  on  the  subject  of  the  Kansas  Histor- 
ical Society,  the  character  of  its  work,  and  the  importance  of  maintaining  it. 

Columbus  Borin,  of  Oberlin,  on  Kansas,  her  History,  her  History-mak- 
ers, and  her  Historical  Society. 

Hon.  James  F.  Legate,  Leavenworth,  on  the  Pioneers  of  Kansas,  refer- 
ring particularly  to  the  services  of  Joel  K.  Goodin,  Samuel  C.  Pomeroy, 
John  Brown,  and  some  others. 

Noble  L.  Prentis,  Newton,  on  the  subject  of  the  Swedish,  Bohemian,  Irish, 
and  other  colonies  of  foreigners  in  Kansas. 

Historical  papers  were  prepared  and  presented  to  the  meeting  by  persons 
who  were  not  present,  as  follows : 

John  P.  Jones,  of  Coldwater,  on  the  subject  of  the  alleged  Exploration  of 
Lieut.  Du  Tisne,  in  1719,  of  the  country  of  the  Osages,  Pawnees  and  Pa- 
douacas. 

J.  S.  Painter,  of  Garden  City,  on  Southwestern  Kansas,  its  settlement, 
development,  and  transformation. 

Prof  C.  A.  Swensson,  of  Lindsborg,  on  the  History  of  the  Swedish  Amer- 
ican settlements  in  Kansas. 

Printed  or  manuscript  copies  of  most  of  these  addresses  and  papers  are  in 
the  files  of  the  Society,  and  should  form  a  part  of  a  volume  of  collections 
which  should  be  published  at  an  early  day. 

TERM  OF  OFFICE  OF  PRESIDENT. 
At  the  annual  meeting  in  January,  1888,  Hon.  D.  W.  Wilder,  having  held 
the  office  of  President  for  one  year,  resigned  the  position,  and  Hon.  Edward 
Russell  of  Lawrence  was  elected  in  his  stead  for  the  unexpired  term  of  one 
year.  This  was  done  in  pursuance  of  the  suggestion  made  by  Gen.  Wilder 
and  approved  by  a  vote  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  that  it  would  be  better 
for  the  interests  of  the  Society  that  the  term  of  the  office  of  President  should 
be  but  for  one  year,  instead  of  two  years  as  provided  in  the  constitution. 


Sixth  biennial  Report.  19 


An  amendment  of  the  constitution  for  this  object  has  been  proposed  and 
placed  in  the  minutes  of  the  Society  for  consideration  at  the  annual  meeting 
in  1889.     It  is  in  the  following  words: 

"  The  elective  officers  of  the  Society  shall  consist  of  a  President  and  two  Vice- 
Presidents,  who  shall  hold  their  offices  for  the  term  of  one  year,  and  until  their  suc- 
cessors shall  be  chosen;  a  Secretary  and  a  Treasurer,  who  shall  hold  their  offices  for 
the  term  of  two  years,  and  until  their  successors  shall  be  chosen;  said  officers  to  be 
chosen  by  the  Board  of  Directors  from  their  members,  their  election  to  be  made  at 
the  first  meeting  of  the  Board  subsequent  to  the  annual  meeting  of  the  Society,  and 
their  terms  of  office  shall  begin  at  the  date  of  their  election  and  qualification  in 


At  this  meeting,  also,  Hon.  William  A.  Phillips,  of  Salina,  was  elected 
one  of  the  Vice-Presidents,  in  the  place  of  Hon.  Henry  H.  Williams,  who  has 
removed  from  the  State.

CHARACTER  OF   THE  LIBRARY. 


The  library  accessions  have  somewhat  exceeded  in  number  the  average  of 
former  periods.  They  have  been  of  the  same  general  character.  The 
purchases  of  books  have  been  chiefly  confined  to  works  more  or  less  directly 


State  Histobical  Society. 


pertaining  to  Kansas.  Gifts  and  exchanges  have  been  more  miscellaneous. 
As  formerly,  they  have  been  largely  the  publications  of  the  educational, 
scientific,  social,  charitable  and  economic  departments  of  other  States  and  of 
the  United  States  Government ;  and  of  the  publications  of  the  voluntary 
societies  and  institutions  of  this  and  of  foreign  countries.  These  go  to  enrich 
our  library  in  those  departments  which  so  much  at  the  present  time  engage 
the  attention  of  students  and  writers  seeking  full  and  exact  information  as 
to  the  social  and  economic  problems  of  the  day.  Our  library  is  constantly 
consulted  by  such  inquirers,  not  merely  of  the  locality  of  Topeka,  but  from 
all  parts  of  the  State. 

While  our  accessions  have  been  largely  such  as  pertain  to  the  history  and 
progress  of  the  State  and  country  in  the  more  remote  past,  they  have  been 
complete  in  the  collection  of  the  materials  of  the  history  of  Kansas  for  the 
period  of  the  two  years  covered  by  this  report.  It  is  the  work  of  saving  the 
materials  of  the  history  and  of  the  intellectual  and  moral  life  of  the  present, 
that  a  historical  society  in  the  final  summing-up  has  been  found  to  have  been 
most  useful.  The  books  and  pamphlets  issued  from  the  press  of  Kansas  have 
been  more  numerous  during  the  past  two  years  than  in  any  other  like  period. 
These  have  all  been  gathered  into  our  library.  They  embrace  a  wide  range 
of  subjects,  historical,  social,  political,  scientific,  and  literary. 

The  addition  to  the  number  of  volumes  of  our  newspapers  and  periodicals 
continues  to  be  a  marked  feature  in  the  growth  of  our  library.  Experience 
brings  constant  proof  of  the  great  value  of  this  department.  We  have  now 
10,050  volumes  of  this  class.  Of  these,  nearly  8,000  volumes  are  of  Kansas 
newspapers.  These  represent  every  county  and  considerable  town  in  the  State. 
They  contain  the  social,  political  and  economic  history  of  every  county  and 
locality.  In  very  large  part  they  are  the  only  files  of  such  papers  that  have 
been  preserved,  and  therefore  are  the  only  records  in  existence  of  a  large  por- 
tion of  the  local  information  which  they  contain.  These  files  are  consulted 
by  people  of  all  classes.  They  are  consulted  by  teachers,  students,  and  local 
historians  and  writers  for  information  as  to  the  early  settlements,  the  organ- 
ization of  societies,  churches,  schools,  corporations,  and  municipal  government ; 
by  political  and  other  writers  for  the  proceedings  of  political  conventions  and 
all  public  gatherings,  and  for  the  records  of  public  men ;  and  they  are  con- 
sulted by  attorneys  and  public  officers  for  official  and  legal  notices. 

Historical  writers  in  these  days  seek  for  original  information  as  to  the 
early  beginnings  and  the  every-day  progress  of  the  social  life  of  the  people. 
And  they  have  come  to  learn  that  it  is  in  the  columns  of  the  daily  and  weekly 
newspaper  that  this  information  has  been  most  fully  recorded,  and  that  no- 
where else  are  exact  data  to  be  found.  Teachers  and  students  in  our  educa- 
tional institutions  are  more  and  more  learning  that  the  study  of  the  history 
and  development  of  their  own  State  and  locality  are  worthy  of  their  attention, 
and  our  files  are  frequently  being  consulted  by  attendants  upon  schools  and 
•colleges  in  all  parts  of  the  State.  No  little  of  the  correspondence  of  the  Sec- 
retary is  employed  in  giving  information  sought  by  students,  teachers,  and 


Seventh  Biennial  Hepobt. 


other  inquirers  for  such  local  information.  It  is  a  matter  of  congratulation 
and  pride  that  in  its  number  of  volumes  of  newspapers,  our  library  far  ex- 
ceeds, in  its  own  local  domain,  that  of  any  other  library  in  any  other  State  or 
country. 

The  regular  issues  of  all  newspapers  and  periodicals  now  being  published 
in  Kansas  are  being  freely  given  to  the  Society  by  the  publishers;  of  all 
classes,  parties  and  creeds.  The  bound  files  are  being  constantly  consulted 
by  people  of  all  classes ;  for  facts  of  local  and  general  history,  of  science, 
public  economy,  and  social  life.  The  truth  of  the  testimony  of  the  best  librar- 
ians of  the  country  as  to  the  usefulness  of  newspaper  files,  is  every  day  being 
verified  in  the  use  which  the  people  are  making  of  the  files  in  our  library.  In 
organizing  this  branch  of  the  work  of  the  Society,  we  were  guided  in  the  outset 
by  such  advice  as  that  given  by  Hon.  A.  R.  Spoffbrd,  who  has  long  been  the 
librarian  of  the  Congressional  Library  at  Washington,  the  largest  library  in 
America.     That  veteran  librarian  says : 

"While  the  files  of  the  journals  of  any  period  furnish,  unquestionably,  the  best 
instruments  for  the  history  of  that  epoch,  it  is  lamentable  to  reflect  that  so  little 
&lt;;are  has  ever  been  taken  to  preserve  a  fair  representation  of  those  of  any  age.  The 
destiny  of  nearly  aU  newspapers  is  swift  destruction,  and  even  those  which  are  pre- 
served, commonly  survive  in  a  provokingly  fragmentary  state.  The  obvious  causes 
of  the  rapid  disappearance  of  periodical  literature  are  its  volume,  necessarily  in- 
creasing every  year,  the  difficulty  of  lodging  the  files  of  any  long  period  in  our 
narrow  apartments,  and  the  continual  demand  for  paper  for  the  uses  of  trade.  To 
these  must  be  added  the  great  cost  of  binding  files  of  journals,  increasing  in  the 
direct  ratio  of  the  size  of  the  volumes.  As  so  formidable  an  expense  can  be  incurred 
by  very  few  private  subscribers  to  periodicals,  so  much  the  more  important  is  it  that 
the  public  libraries  should  not  neglect  a  duty  which  they  owe  to  their  generation  as 
well  as  to  those  that  are  to  follow.  These  poor  journals  of  to-day,  which  everybody 
is  ready  to  stigmatize  as  trash  not  worth  the  room  to  store  or  the  money  to  bind, 
are  the  very  materials  which  the  man  of  the  future  will  search  for  with  eagerness,  and 
for  some  of  which  he  will  be  ready  to  pay  their  weight  in  gold.  These  representatives 
of  the  commercial,  industrial,  inventive,  social,  literary,  political,  moral  and  religious 
life  of  the  times,  should  be  preserved  and  handed  down  to  posterity  with  sedulous 
care.  No  historian,  or  other  writer  on  any  subject,  who  would  write  conscientiously 
or  with  full  information,  can  afford  to  neglect  this  fruitful  mine  of  the  journals, 
where  his  richest  materials  are  to  be  found." 

During  the  past  few  months  a  great  change  has  taken  place  in  the  political 
character  of  Kansas  newspapers.  Nearly  one  hundred  have  been  established 
to  promote  the  political  views  of  an  organization  new  to  Kansas  politics ;  or 
have  changed  from  allegiance  to  other  organizations  to  support  the  views  of 
this.  Whether  it  shall  prove  that  this  change  shall  mark  the  beginning  of  a 
permanent  era  in  political  progress,  or  whether  it  shall  prove  to  have  been 
but  a  manifestation  of  temporary  discontent  as  the  result  of  temporary  de- 
pression, it  is  certain  that  our  Historical  Society  has  preserved  the  fullest 
record  of  the  history  of  a  widespread  and  profound  political  agitation  among 
the  people  ever  preserved  in  any  State  or  country.  Fifteen  years  ago  the  Kan- 
sas State  Historical  Society  was  organized,  as  was  said  in  the  first  paper 
drawn  in  contemiDlation  of  its  organization,  "for  the  purpose  of  saving  the 


STATE  HISTOBICAL  SOCIETY. 


present  and  past  records  of  our  twenty-one  years  of  eventful  history."  These 
words  looked  backward  to  the  gathering  of  the  materials  of  the  proud  his- 
tory which  Kansas  had  before  that  time  made.  But  Kansas  had  not  then 
stopped  making  history.  The  work  has  since  gone  steadily  forward.  The 
State  Historical  Society  succeeded  beyond  all  expectations  in  gathering  up 
the  materials  of  the  former  history.  At  the  same  time  it  has  carefully  and 
industriously  saved  the  materials  of  the  history  of  current  events,  and  of  all 
social,  material  and  political  movements  since  it  was  organized.  It  is  now 
found  that  the  record  of  the  history  since  the  Society  was  formed  is  of  little 
less  value  than  that  of  what  had  occurred  before.  As  individuals,  or  as 
members  of  social  organizations,  or  political  parties,  we  may  not  always  be 
satisfied  with  the  record ;  the  record  may,  indeed,  be  that  of  sore  disappoint- 
ment. But  in  the  final  sumjming-up,  when  the  people  of  the  future  genera- 
tions for  whom  the  work  of  the  Historical  Society  is  done,  shall  pass  upon 
the  usefulness  to  them  of  our  collections,  they  will  bless  us  that  we  have 
preserved  all  the  materials  of  the  history  of  all  that  has  transpired. 

Among  the  larger  gifts  of  books  and  pamphlets,  besides  those  coming  from 
our  own  citizens  have  been  as  usual  many  from  the  East ;  given  by  persons 
whose  life-work  seems  to  be  largely  that  of  aiding  to  build  up  libraries,  as  a 
means  of  promoting  education  among  the  people,  and  whose  attention  has 
been  drawn  to  Kansas  by  influences  which  have  ever  made  this  the  favorite 
State  for  the  expenditure  of  benevolences,  and  for  the  promotion  of  enter- 
prises in  the  interest  of  human  progress.  Of  the  larger  contributors  the  fol- 
lowing names  may  be  mentioned :  Dr.  Samuel  A.  Green,  Rev.  Dr.  Caleb  D. 
Bradlee,  and  Mr.  J.  P.  Mendum,  all  of  Boston ;  Prof  A.  S.  Gatschet,  of 
Washington,  D.  C;  and,  of  our  own  State,  Hon.  D.  W.  Wilder,  Rev.  J.  W. 
D.  Anderson,  Rev.  M.  O.  Harrington,  Rev.  D.  D.  Proper,  and  Messrs.  A.  S. 
Huling,  L.  R.  Elliott,  Frank  A.  Root,  F.  O.  Popenoe,  and  C.  E.  Pond. 

The  manuscript  accessions  as  usual  have  been  large,  and  the  papers 
acquired  are  of  much  historical  interest.  Those  contributed  by  Col.  D.  H. 
Home,  Rev.  Dr.  Bradlee,  Col.  William  A.  Phillips,  Benjamin  Singleton, 
Sidney  Hayden,  W.  H.  R.  Lykins,  and  William  Barnes,  are  especially 
worthy  of  mention.  Those  of  Mr.  Lykins  relate  to  early  movements  among 
Kansas  settlers  in  securing  titles  to  their  lands  and  in  the  sale  and  distribu- 
tion of  town-lot  interests.  Those  given  by  Mr.  Barnes  are  papers  which 
show  the  work  of  an  Eastern  emigrant  aid  organization  in  promoting  the 
colonization  of  Kansas,  influenced  largely  by  an  interest  in  the  Free-State 
side  of  the  great  political  struggle  which  convulsed  the  country  during  the 
early  years  of  the  Territorial  period. 

The  accessions  of  pictures  and  portraits  have  been  large.  ISToteworthy 
among  these  are  the  portraits  of  members  of  the  Legislature,  and  State  officers, 
and  of  other  public  men  and  prominent  citizens  of  the  State ;  some  of  which, 
as  those  of  Hon.  E.  P.  McCabe,  Hon.  F.  P.  Baker,  Hon.  E.  N.  Morrill,  Gov. 
John  A.  Martin,  and  of  Chief  Justice  A.  H.  Horton,  are  of  large  size,  and 
executed  in  a  high  style  of  the  photographic  art  or  of  that  of  the  painter's

skill.  A  gift  to  the  Society  of  a  plaster  copy  of  Brackett's  bust  of  John 
Brown,  given  by  Mrs.  Mary  E.  Stearns,  of  Medford,  Massachusetts,  is  worthy 
of  special  mention,  especially  as  this  is  but  one  of  eight  given  by  the  donor 
and  her  friends  in  Massachusetts  to  different  societies  and  institutions  in 
Kansas.  A  lifelike  statuette  of  Henry  Ward  Beecher,  given  by  Maj.  J.  B. 
Pond,  of  New  York,  is  an  attractive  object  in  our  rooms. 

Among  the  larger  accessions  of  volumes  of  newspaper  files  will  be  noticed 
those  contributed  to  the  library  by  Prof.  I.  T.  Goodnow,  Hon.  John  Speer, 
Hon.  F.  P.  Baker,  Hon.  James  R.  Mead,  Dr.  Caleb  D.  Bradlee,  and  Hon. 
John  Maloy. 

Interesting  war  and  other  relics  have  been  given  the  Society  by  Hon.  John 
Davis,  W.  W.  Phillips,  Esq.,  Hon.  L.  D.  Bailey,  W.  H.  H.  Fox,  Rev.  Dr. 
Bradlee,  Hon.  Sol.  Miller,  Hon.  A.  D.  Walker,  Mr.  T.  A.  Stanley,  and  Man- 
hattan Lodge  of  I.  O.  O.  F.,  the  last  mentioned  being  that  of  the  sword  of 
Gov.  Green,  of  the  war  of  the  Rebellion. 

CATALOG. 

The  last  Legislature  increased  the  appropriation  for  the  Society  in  the  item 
of  clerk  hire  with  the  view  to  the  cataloging  of  our  library.  Much  time  has 
been  given  during  the  past  year  and  a  half  to  this  work.  It  is  a  measure  of 
great  importance,  as  it  is  intended  through  such  catalog  to  exhibit  to  the 
public  a  detailed  showing  of  what  the  library  contains,  and  to  make  its  entire 
contents  accessible  for  reference.  This  work  has  so  far  progressed  as  to 
promise  the  early  publication  of  a  first  volume.  It  was  confidently  expected 
that  such  a  volume  would  have  been  issued  before  the  present  time.  It  is  a 
work  requiring  the  greatest  care  in  order  to  insure  accuracy  and  complete- 
ness ;  and  all  experience  in  library  cataloging  has  shown  that  the  measure  of 
time  within  which  such  work  can  be  accomplished  cannot  be  correctly  esti- 
mated. 

The  first  volume,  now  in  preparation,  will  consist  of  and  be  confined  to  a 
catalog  of  matter  exclusively  pertaining  to  Kansas.  It  will  show  the  works 
of  Kansas  history,  literature,  science,  and  all  books  and  pamphlets  which  have 
been  written  and  published  in  Kansas  or  about  Kansas,  with  indexes  in 
many  instances  showing  their  particular  contents.  It  will  show  the  various 
Kansas  church  and  society  publications.  It  will  give  an  index  to  Kansas 
documentary  history,  showing  the  publications  of  the  Legislature,  of  the  State 
executive  departments,  and  the  State  charitable,  educational,  and  other  insti- 
tutions. It  will  point  out  those  numerous  Congressional  and  executive  papers 
of  the  United  States  Government,  issued  during  the  period  of  our  Territorial 
history,  and  published  in  the  United  States  documentary  volumes,  with  full 
indexes  to  the  most  important  of  this  class.  Subsequent  volumes  of  the 
catalog  will  show  the  manuscript  and  museum  collections  of  the  Society  and 
the  various  works  of  history,  science,  political  and  social  economy,  which  go 
to  make  up  the  general  library.

FOURTH  VOLUME. 

During  the  present  year  the  Secretary  has  compiled  and  had  published  the 
fourth  volume  of  the  Collections  of  the  Society.  This  volume  makes  an  ex- 
hibit of  the  work  of  the  Society  during  the  four  years  preceding  the  period 
covered  by  this  report,  and  includes  the  historical  papers  presented  at  the 
several  annual  and  other  meetings  held  in  that  time.  It  also  contains  the 
official  correspondence  pertaining  to  the  office  of  Governor  of  Kansas  Terri- 
tory during  the  latter  part  of  Gov.  Shannon's  administration  in  1856,  and  of 
Governor  Geary's  administration  from  September  9, 1856,  to  March  10, 1857, 
including  the  official  executive  minutes  kept  by  Gov.  Geary.  These  docu- 
ments relate  to  a  considerable  portion  of  the  most  stirring  period  of  Kansas 
Territorial  history.  They  have  been  gathered  from  Congressional  documents 
published  about  that  period.  These  documents  have  hitherto  lain  hidden 
from  the  general  public,  and  much  of  what  they  contain  will  be  found  to  be 
new  to  students  of  Kansas  history.  The  book  has  an  alphabetical  index  of 
sixty  pages,  pointing  to  every  subject  and  almost  every  name  contained  in  it ; 
also  a  chronological  index  to  the  contents  of  the  public  documents.  These 
official  papers,  added  to  those  pertaining  to  the  administrations  of  Gov.  Reeder 
and  Gov.  Shannon  contained  in  our  third  volume  of  Collections,  make  a  full 
record  of  this  class  of  historical  material  through  the  first  three  and  a  half 
years  of  Kansas  Territorial  history. 

ROOMS. 

As  the  Capitol  building  is  soon  to  be  completed,  it  is  to  be  hoped  that  not 
many  months  will  elapse  before  the  Society  will  have  given  it  suitable  accom- 
modations for  its  library  and  collections  and  ample  provision  for  its  future 
growth.  This  subject  will  no  doubt  have  the  careful  attention  of  the  appro- 
priate committee  of  the  Society. 

UNION   OF   LIBRARIES. 

The  State  Senate  at  the  last  session  of  the  Legislature  appointed  a  com- 
mittee to  devise  and  to  recommend  to  the  Senate  at  the  coming  session  of  the 
Legislature  measures  of  legislation,  amendatory  of  existing  laws,  for  the  more 
effective  and  economical  administration  of  the  State  government  in  its  various 
departments.  The  committee  invited  our  State  Historical  Society  to  make  sug- 
gestions of  changes  which  might  be  desirable  in  the  law  governing  the  Society. 
The  subject  was  considered  by  members  of  your  executive  committee,  and  a 
draft  of  a  bill  to  take  the  place  of  the  present  law  was  prepared  and  given  the 
Senate  committee.  The  proposed  bill  contained  substantially  the  provisions  of 
the  existing  law ;  making  the  Society  the  trustee  of  the  State,  responsible  to  the 
State  for  all  its  work,  and  making  its  entire  collections  the  property  of  the  State, 
to  be  kept  in  the  State  Capitol  for  the  use  of  all  the  people  for  all  time.  The 
bill  placed  the  financial  administration  and  general  management  of  the  Society 
more  under  the  care  and  control  of  the  executive  officers  of  the  State,  by 


SEVENTH  BIENNIAL  REPOBT.  11 


providing  that  the  Governor  and  other  constitutional  State  officers  shall,  by 
virtue  of  office,  be  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  that  they  shall 
compose  a  majority  of  the  committee  to  audit  accounts,  to  make  rules  gov- 
erning the  care  of  the  library,  and  to  supervise  the  purchase  of  books,  and 
the  expenditure  of  all  moneys  appropriated  by  the  Legislature  for  the  use  of 
the  Society. 

It  seems  that  the  Senate  committee,  instead  of  approving  the  legislation  pro- 
posed by  our  committee,  propose  a  consolidation  of  the  State  Historical  Society 
with  the  State  Library,  virtually  abolishing  the  State  Historical  Society.  But 
it  is  hardly  to  be  presumed  that  the  Legislature  would  seriously  entertain  a 
proposition  of  this  kind. 

Such  legislation  as  would  bring  the  two  institutions  into  relations  which 
would  harmonize  and  economize  the  library  work  of  the  State  would  no 
doubt  be  desirable ;  for  economy  to  the  State,  for  the  convenience  of  users  of 
the  two  libraries,  and  as  promotive  of  efficient  work  in  the  collection  of  such 
library  materials  as  should  be  brought  together  in  the  State  Capitol  for  pub- 
lic use.  Such  a  measure,  or  one  virtually  contemplating  the  same  object,  was, 
early  in  the  existence  of  the  State  Historical  Society,  considered  by  our  board 
of  directors  in  conference  with  the  Trustees  of  the  State  Library.  The  Board 
of  Directors  proposed  to  the  trustees  that  a  line  of  distinction  should  be 
drawn  between  the  two  libraries ;  that  the  State  Library  should  be  confined 
to  what  is  always  the  primary  and  essential  work  of  State  libraries,  that  of 
making  up  a  library  of  books  of  law  and  of  such  works  of  reference  as  may 
be  needed  for  the  use  of  the  Supreme  Court  and  attorneys  practicing  therein, 
and  by  State  officers  and  the  Legislature;  and  that  the  State  Historical 
Society  should  have  given  to  it  the  miscellaneous  department  of  the  State 
Library ;  the  work  of  which  has  been,  so  far  as  it  has  gone,  essentially  of  the 
same  character  as  that  of  the  State  Historical  Society.  This  would  be  a  clear 
line  of  demarkation;  and  it  is  one  which  experience  in  other  States  has 
proven  to  be  practicable  and  efficient.  In  the  State  of  New  York,  under  the 
care  of  the  Regents  of  the  State  University,  the  State  Library  has  grown  up 
with  such  a  division,  there  being  separate  libraries  and  separate  librarians  for 
the  law  and  for  the  miscellaneous,  or  the  general  library,  as  it  is  there  called. 
In  Wisconsin,  where  of  all  States  the  State  Library  work  has  been  done 
most  efficiently,  this  line  of  distinction  has  been  for  thirty-five  years  in  force. 
There  the  State  Library  has  the  law  side  and  the  State  Historical  Society  has 
the  miscellaneous  and  historical  side.  The  one  has  grown  up  with  ample 
maintenance  for  official  and  judicial  use,  and  the  other  is  equally  well  sup- 
ported in  gathering  a  library  of  the  materials  of  the  history  of  the  State  and 
of  the  social,  political  and  scientific  history  of  the  country.  No  other  State 
in  the  Union  possesses  so  valuable  a  general,  historical  and  miscellaneous 
library  as  does  Wisconsin. 

But  the  Trustees  of  the  State  Library,  upon  consideration  found  that  ex- 
isting laws  did  not  authorize  them  to  accept  the  proposal  of  the  State  His- 
torical Society.     Such  authority  has  not  yet  been  given  by  the  Legislature ; 


12  State  Histobical  Society. 

and  for  fifteen  years  the  two  libraries  have  been  growing  up  in  more  or  less 
conflict,  and  with  more  or  less  detriment  to  public  economy  and  to  public 
usefulness.  This  legislation,  it  would  seem,  should  now  be  had ;  legislation 
clearly  defining  the  work  of  the  two  institutions,  giving  to  the  State  Library 
its  essential  and  appropriate  work  of  providing  for  the  needs  of  the  Supreme 
Court,  and  to  the  State  Historical  Society  that  of  making  up  a  reference 
library  of  history,  science,  political  and  social  economy,  and  of  such  materials 
as  will  be  useful  to  students  of  the  history  of  their  State  and  of  the  country. 

There  are  but  few  examples  showing  the  experience  of  other  States  in  an 
effort  to  make  up  a  full  general  or  historical  library ;  in  but  few  of  the  States 
are  such  libraries  being  built  up  and  maintained  by  the  State.  In  almost  all 
of  the  States  there  is  one  so  called  State  Library.  This  is  under  the  control 
of  the  Governor,  or  of  the  judicial  department  of  the  State,  and  the  collec- 
tion of  books  is  almost  exclusively  confined  to  law  books  and  books  of  ref- 
erence for  the  use  of  the  Supreme  Court.  Beyond  this  object  little  attention 
is  given  to  the  building  up  of  a  library.  But  in  States  where  historical 
societies  have  been  maintained  by  the  State,  their  chief  object  being  the 
making  up  of  a  library  of  the  materials  of  the  State,  and  all  its  localities, 
such  institutions  have  become  the  pride  and  glory  of  the  people.  And  where 
the  State  has  failed  to  have  this  work  done  the  neglect  has  eventually  come 
to  be  deplored  by  all. 

All  experience  has. proven  that  historical  societies,  connected  with  the 
State  and  made  responsible  to  the  State,  as  is  our  society,  do  the  work  of 
building  up  a  general  library  and  a  library  of  historical  materials  for  the  use 
of  the  people  far  more  effectively  than  do  State  libraries  however  managed. 
The  general  side,  the  miscellaneous  side,  the  historical  side  of  a  State  library, 
by  whatever  name  it  may  be  called,  if  under  the  management  of  a  sole 
executive  officer  of  the  State  or  of  the  judicial  department  of  the  State,  is 
more  remotely  in  contact  with  the  people,  is  less  directly  in  sympathetic  com- 
munication with  the  people ;  its  managing  board  is  not  so  immediately  respon- 
sible to  the  people ;  and  above  all,  its  entire  work  is  not  done  for  the  use  of 
the  whole  people.  What  is  done  on  the  popular  side  is  only  of  secondary 
consideration  compared  with  the  primary  object  of  the  existence  of  the 
library. 

On  the  other  hand,  with  the  suggested  line  of  separation,  the  historical  or 
miscellaneous  side  of  the  work  given  to  a  State  historical  society  composed 
of  an  interested  membership  of  the  more  intelligent  citizens  of  the  State,  re- 
siding in  all  parts  of  the  State,  the  work  is  carried  on  efficiently  and  with  a 
view  to  the  benefit  of  the  whole  people.  Such  a  society  engages  the  popular 
interest.  Its  library  comes  to  be  held  in  esteem  by  all  the  people,  as  a  place 
where  all  may  resort  for  the  examination  of  original  sources  of  information, 
as  to  the  earliest  and  latest  events.  The  citizen  takes  pride  in  contributing 
to  such  a  library,  and  its  accessions  come  to  be  made  up  in  large  part,  from 
year  to  year,  by  voluntary  gifts.  Besides  the  gratification'  of  serving  the 
State  through  contributions  to  an  honored  institution  of  the  State,  and  in  so 


I

doing  contributing  to  that  which  will  promote  the  education  of  the  people,  it 
often  happens  that  donors  find  here  a  means  by  which  their  library  treasures, 
which  might  otherwise  become  scattered  and  lost  to  good  uses,  may  be  kept 
together  and  made  of  perpetual  benefit.  The  increase  of  such  libraries  is 
found  to  be  in  greater  ratio  year  by  year.  They  seem  to  contain  within 
themselves  a  principle  of  acceleration,  and  to  illustrate  the  truth  of  the 
maxim  that  "To  him  that  hath  shall  be  given."  Such  has  been  the  ex- 
perience in  the  growth  of  our  Historical  Society.  For  fifteen  years  it  has 
been  maintained  by  the  State,  and  has  sustained  a  growth  and  popularity  un- 
precedented. 

The  Board  of  Directors  calls  attention  to  this  subject  at  the  present  time, 
because  it  is  one  of  vital  interest  to  the  Society.  The  just  demand  of  the 
people  for  an  economical  administration  of  public  afiairs  applies  to  the  library 
work  of  the  State,  and  should  be  enforced.  The  library  materials  of  the  State 
must  soon  be  given  new  places  in  the  completed  Capitol  building.  There  is 
every  reason  w^hy  the  Legislature  should  permanently  establish  a  plan  for  the 
State  Library  work.  It  is  the  dut}^  of  the  Society  to  see  to  it  that  the  work 
in  which  it  has  been  so  long  engaged  at  the  demand  of  the  people  and  with 
their  manifest  approval,  should  not  be  sacrificed  or  its  efficiency  impaired.

STATE  HISTOBIGAL  SOCIETY. 


The  Kansas  State  Historical  Society  had  its  origin  in  action  taken  by  the 
editors  and  publishers  of  Kansas.  At  a  meeting  of  the  State  Editors'  and 
Publishers'  Association  in  1875,  a  resolution  was  adopted,  under  which  a  com- 
mittee was  appointed,  in  the  language  of  the  resolution,  "for  the  purpose  of 
saving  the  j^resent  and  past  records  of  our  21  years  of  eventful  history."  The 
events  of  17  years  have  since  been  added  to  those  of  the  period  named.  The 
Society  began  as  a  voluntary  association,  without  recognition  by  the  State. 
But  it  brought  its  collections  into  the  State  House  from  the  first.  Soon  the 
value  of  its  work  became  recognized  by  the  State ;  means  were  appropriated 
by  the  Legislature  for  its  support,  and  rooms  in  the  Capitol  building  were 
designated  for  its  use.  In  1879  a  law  was  passed  making  the  Society  the 
trustee  of  the  State,  and  defining  its  duties  and  its  relations  to  the  State.  The 
law  declares  the  collections  of  the  Society  to  be  the  property  of  the  State,  and 
the  Society  has  accepted  the  conditions  imposed  by  this  projvision.  The  law 
broadened  the  scope  of  the  work  of  the  Society  beyond  that  of  a  mere  collec- 
tion of  Kansas  historical  materials,  to  that  of  making  up  a  general  library  of 
reference,  especially  in  the  departments  of  history,  science,  sociology,  and  the 
useful  arts.  To  augment  its  collections,  the  law  gives  the  Society  60  bound 
copies  each  of  the  publications  of  the  State  and  its  various  institutions,  for 
use  in  exchanges  with  other  societies  and  institutions ;  and  for  the  yearly  use 
of  the  Society,  a  small  sum  is  api3ropriated  for  the  purchase  of  books  to  supply 
deficiencies  in  the  various  departments. 

Under  these  fostering  provisions,  a  library  of  reference  in  the  departments 
contemplated  has  grown  up  not  exceeded  in  the  number  of  its  volumes  and . 
in  their  value  as  such  materials  by  more  than  one  library  west  of  the  Alle- 
ghany mountains.  There  are  other  historical  society  libraries  which  have 
long  been  receiving  far  greater  appropriations  for  the  purchase  of  library  ac- 
cessions, but  not  one  has  grown  more  rapidly.  This  fact  of  the  rapid  growth 
of  our  library  by  gifts  is  no  doubt  in  no  small  measure  attributable  to  the 
prominence  which  Kansas  has  had  from  the  beginning  of  its  history  in  affairs 
of  world-wide  interest.  The  events  of  the  territorial  period  of  our  history 
were  the  prelude  to  the  civil  war.  From  that  time  to  the  present,  Kansas 
has  been  eventful  in  social  progress  and  in  political  agitation.  The  fact  that 
such  a  State  is  making  up  a  historical,  scientific  and  political  library  has  at- 
tracted the  attention  of  the  libraries  and  institutions,  not  only  of  this  entire 
country,  but  of  the  world.  Our  society  makes  exchanges  with  libraries  and 
institutions  in  all  of  the  States,  and  in  many  foreign  countries.  Thus  this  li- 
brary is  being  made  up  with  little  cost  to  the  State. 

From  lists  and  statements  appended  to  this  report,  it  will  be  seen  that  the 
growth  of  the  library  and  collections  has  been  equal  to  that  of  former  peri- 
ods, and,  in  important  respects,  greater.  Our  lists  of  acknowledgments  show 
that  the  accessions  by  gift  and  exchange  during  the  past  two  years  have 
come  from  more  than  2,000  different  sources.  More  than  half  of  the  persons, 
societies  and  institutions  giving  these  publications  reside  outside  of  Kansas. 


EIGHTH  BIENNIAL  REPOBT. 


The  gifts  relate  to  the  history  and  progress  of  the  country,  from  the  earliest  to 
the  latest  period.  They  are  very  largely  of  those  classes  of  library  materials 
which  record  in  particular  detail  the  events  of  the  period  covered  by  the  re- 
port, events  in  all  the  affairs  of  human  activity ;  they  record  the  thoughts,  the 
sentiments,  the  social  movements,  and  the  efforts  at  human  progress  in  all 
respects. 

BOOKS. 

The  growth  of  the  library  in  books  of  historical  reference  of  permanent 
value  has  been  very  gratifying.  By  exchanges  effected  through  the  Inte- 
rior Department  at  Washington,  331  volumes  of  the  publications  of  the 
United  States  Government  of  a  political  and  scientific  character  have  the 
past  two  years  been  added.  The  gift  of  513  volumes  of  books,  made  by 
the  Thomas  Crane  Library,  of  Quincy,  Mass.,  is  one  of  great  interest.  The 
books  are  largely  United  States  Government  records,  beginning  with  those  of 
the  First  Congress,  which  met  in  New  York  in  1789.  These  contain  the  defi- 
nite and  detailed  history  of  the  very  beginning^  of  our  permanent  national 
existence.  These  books  came  from  the  home  of  two  Presidents  of  the 
United  States.  Some  of  them  contain  the  autograph  of  one  of  these,  John 
Quincy  Adams,  of  whose  library  they  once  formed  a  part.  They  are  the 
direct  gift  of  Hon.  Chas.  Francis  Adams,  a  worthy  descendent  of  the  line, 
who  is  the  present  trustee  of  the  library  which  held  these  books  as  dupli- 
cates. To  our  former  Kansas  citizen  of  the  territorial  period,  Hon.  Chas. 
A.  Foster,  of  Osawatomie,  the  Society  is  indebted  for  the  thoughtful  act  of 
calling  the  attention  of  Mr.  Adams  to  the  appropriateness  of  this  gift.  The 
gift  is  an  illustration  of  the  fact  that,  in  its  effort  to  preserve  the  materials  of 
its  history,  Kansas  has  the  interest  and  sympathy  of  intelligent  and  liberal 
people  throughout  the  country. 

Hon.  Thomas  Ryan,  United  States  Minister  to  Mexico,  always  a  liberal 
contributor  to  the  library  of  the  Society,  has  given,  during  the  two  years,  197 
volumes  of  books  from  his  private  collection.  Prof  I.  T.  Goodnow,  a  devoted 
literary  collector  through  all  the  years  of  Kansas  life,  has  given  from  his  own 
store  13  books  and  837  pamphlets.  Dr.  Samuel  A.  Green,  of  the  Massachu- 
setts Historical  Society,  has  continued  to  enrich  our  library,  by  the  gift,  during 
the  two  years,  of  35  books  and  187  pamphlets.  The  long  list  of  contributors 
of  this  class  is  remarkable,  as  showing  the  sources  of  the  growth  of  our  library. 

PAMPHLETS. 

The  pamphlet  accessions,  7,502  in  number,  are  in  large  part  the  reports  of 
societies  and  institutions.  These  show  the  work  of  numberless  thoughtful 
and  earnest  people,  engaged  in  individual  or  in  associated  endeavor  to  pro- 
mote some  movement  or  some  measure  intended  to  benefit  mankind.  Of  the 
historical  value  of  this  class  of  library  materials,  Lord  Beaconsfield  once  said : 
*'  Pamphlets,  those  leaves  of  an  hour,  and  volumes  of  a  season,  and  even  of  a 
week,  slight  and  evanescent  as  they  appear,  and  scorned  at  by  opposite  par- 


State  Historical  Society. 


ties,  while  each  cherishes  its  own,  are  in  truth  the  records  of  the  public  mind 
— the  secret  history  of  a  people." 

NEWSPAPERS   AND   PERIODICALS. 

It  is  with  gratification  that  we  refer  to  the  continued  evidences  of  the  use- 
fulness of  the  newspaper  department  of  our  Society.  While  at  all  times  our 
newspaper  files  are  found  the  best  source  of  information  as  to  what  has  trans- 
pired in  all  affairs  in  all  parts  of  the  State,  their  usefulness  is  made  more 
especially  apparent  during  the  progress  of  great  political  canvasses.  It  is 
then  that  the  political  platforms  of  the  past  are  reexamined,  and  the  records 
which  have  been  made  by  candidates  in  former  years  are  scrutinized.  In 
these  times  of  quick  and  close  communication,  by  telegraph,  telephone,  and 
railroads,  the  people  of  the  State  are  at  such  times  brought  into  the  closest 
communication.  The  whole  people  confer  together  as  in  one  assembly.  Every 
possible  thing  bearing  upon  questions  at  issue  and  upon  the  characters  of 
men  up  for  office  is  discussed  by  all.  What  a  county  platform  may  contain, 
adopted  years  ago  in  the  farthest  corner  of  the  State,  comes  to  be  considered 
of  prime  importance,  as  affecting  the  present  status  of  a  party  or  a  candidate. 
Our  library,  the  only  place  where  the  facts  in  full  may  be  established,  is  at 
once  consulted.  Our  9,054  volumes  of  Kansas  newspaper  files  contain  the 
political  records  of  men  and  parties  in  Kansas  for  all  the  years  that  have 
gone  before. 

This  is  but  one  feature  of  the  value  of  newspaper  files  as  materials  of  the 
history  of  the  past.  They  contain  a  record  of  all  in  human  thought  and  in 
human  activity  in  the  past.  In  the  language  of  the  late  Gov.  John  A.  Martin, 
who  was  among  the  founders  and  builders  up  of  this  Society,  these  newspaper 
files  contain  "every  essential  fact  connected  with  the  growth  and  develop- 
ment of  the  communities  in  which  they  are  jDublished :  marriages  and  deaths ; 
the  establishment  of  business  and  manufacturing  enterprises,  and  their  changes ; 
transfers  of  property ;  the  erection  of  all  important  buildings ;  the  results  of 
elections ;  the  opening  of  streets ;  the  building  of  railroads ;  fires  and  floods ; 
the  municipal  policies  suggested,  discussed,  and  adopted ;  and  the  daily  life, 
thoughts,  hopes,  triumphs  and  disappointments  of  an  aspiring  and  energetic 
community."  Such  is  the  character  of  the  historical  information  in  the  Kan- 
sas newspaper  files  in  the  library  of  our  State  Historical  Society  respecting 
every  county  and  every  community  in  the  State.  There  is  no  part  of  the 
State  whose  history  in  all  these  particulars  is  not  here  to  be  found. 

What  Kansas  is  doing  in  saving  materials  of  the  history  of  the  State 
through  its  newspaper  files  is  being  done  to  a  considerable  extent  by  other 
Western  historical  societies,  but  by  none  to  so  great  an  extent  as  by  our  So- 
ciety. Our  example  is  awakening  Eastern  historical  societies  to  the  impor- 
tance of  this  work.  Says  the  report  of  the  Connecticut  Historical  Society  for 
1891:  "It  is  admitted  by  all  that  newspapers  are  the  one  great  source  of 
printed  material  for  the  making  of  history.     Also  that  the  historical  societies

of  the  East  are  far  behind  those  at  the  West  in  collecting  this  material, 
should  certainly  keep  files  of  the  Connecticut  papers."

MANUSCRIPTS. 

The  manuscript  accessions  have  been  unusually  large.  Among  the  most 
valuable  of  this  class  ever  received  into  the  library  of  the  society  is  the 
journal  kept  by  the  missionary,  Rev.  Jotham  Meeker,  the  gift  of  Mrs.  Will- 
iam T.  Keith,  of  Oakland,  Cal.,  the  surviving  daughter  of  Mr.  Meeker. 
This  journal  consists  of  three  books,  containing  in  all  732  closely-written 
foolscap  pages.  The  entries  begin  with  September  10,  1832,  and  end  with 
January  4,  1855,  the  last  entry  having  been  made  eight  days  before  the  death 
of  Mr.  Meeker.  They  give  an  account  of  his  journey  in  1832  from  Cincin- 
nati, by  the  way  of  the  Ohio  river,  the  Ohio  canal,  and  the  lakes,  to  Sault 
Ste.  Marie ;  of  his  residence  there  for  a  few  months,  and  then  of  his  removal 
to  the  Indian  Territory — now  Kansas  —  and  of  his  continued  residence  here 
until  his  death.  While  at  Sault  Ste.  Marie,  he  invented  his  remarkable  pho- 
netic alphabet,  which  he  adjusted  to  all  Indian  languages,  and  which  came 
to  be  employed  by  many  missionaries  in  their  early  work  among  the  Indians. 
Coming  to  the  Indian  Territory,  Mr.  Meeker  brought  with  him  from  Cincin- 
nati a  printing  press,  which  he  set  up  at  the  Shawnee  Baptist  Mission,  a  few 
miles  out  from  Kansas  City,  and  began  printing  in  March,  1834.  He  printed 
editions  of  many  instruction  books,  hymn  books,  tracts,  and  portions  of  the 
Bible,  in  the  Shawnee,  Delaware,  Ottawa,  and  other  languages.  The  alphabet 
used  being  strictly  phonetic,  the  task  of  learning  to  read  was  practically 
only  that  of  learning  the  characters  of  the  alphabet.  Children  and  adults 
alike  were  quickly  enabled  to  read  the  Bible  and  other  books  in  their  own 
tongues.  Missionary  effort  became  greatly  stimulated  through  the  use  of 
this  remarkable  invention.  This  journal  of  Mr.  Meeker  contains  the  whole 
history  of  his  printing.  The  library  of  the  society  contains  several  of  the 
small  books  printed  by  Mr.  Meeker  in  this  alphabet.  But  the  Indian 
languages  were  not  languages  of  civilization,  and  no  abiding  results  followed 
the  use  of  the  Meeker  phonetic  alphabet,  except  as  its  use  opened  to  the  un- 
tutored mind  of  the  Indian  the  nature  and  power  of  the  white  man's  books, 
and  influenced  him  to  have  his  children  taught  the  white  man's  language 
and  literature. 

The  manuscript  journal  exhibits  the  daily  life  of  the  missionary  and  his 
family  in  the  wilderness,  and  the  life  and  customs,  and,  in  too  many  instances, 
the  degraded  condition,  of  the  rude  aborigines,  greatly  demoralized  and  cor- 
rupted as  they  were  through  intercourse  with  the  frontier  white  people,  from 
contact  with  whom  they  had  been  removed  from  further  east,  only  again  to 
be  subjected  to  like  influences  in  their  new  homes  in  the  new  Territory. 

This  journal  had  remained  in  the  possession  of  different  members  of  Mr. 
Meeker's  family  for  more  than  37  years  since  his  death.  The  generous 
thoughtfulness  of  the  daughter  in  finally  placing  it  in  the  library  of  our  So- 
ciety must  always  be  held  in  grateful  appreciation. 


State  Histobigal  Society, 


Valuable  gifts  of  manuscripts  have  been  made  to  the  Society  by  former 
residents  of  Kansas  who  have  long  been  absent.  Hon.  William  Hutchinson, 
a  prominent  citizen  of  Kansas  during  the  territorial  period,  but  who  has  re- 
sided for  30  years  past  in  Washington  city,  has  given  upwards  of  70  manu- 
script papers,  consisting  chiefly  of  letters  of  prominent  persons  who  were 
active  in  early  Kansas  affairs.  Among  the  writers  appear  the  names  of  Dr. 
W.  W.  Updegraff;  Jas.  Kedpath,  Justin  S.  Morrill,  C.  K.  Holliday,  Henry 
Harvey,  Hugh  S.  Walsh,  W.  W.  Ross,  R.  J.  Hinton,  E.  P.  Watson,  Thos. 
Ewing,  jr.,  S.  C.  Pomeroy,  Lucy  Larcom,  Henry  J.  Adams,  Geo.  W.  Colla- 
more,  Marcus  J.  Parrott,  Henry  J.  Raymond,  Gov.  A.  H.  Reeder,  Gov.  Chas. 
Robinson,  Geo.  W.  Brown,  Dr.  Jos.  P.  Root,  Eli  Thayer,  Augustus  Wattles, 
William  Hutchinson,  W.  Y.  Roberts,  A.  Curtis,  Thos.  W.  Higginson,  C.  C. 
Parker,  E.  B.  Whitman,  Mrs.  Jennie  E.  Eddy,  Mrs.  J.  M.  Howard,  H.  Miles 
Moore,  G.  W.  Hutchinson,  O.  C.  Brown,  and  W.  H.  Russell. 

Mr.  Hutchinson  was  a  member  of  the  Wyandotte  constitutional  con- 
vention, and  during  the  territorial  period  was  a  correspondent  of  the  New 
York  Times,  the  Boston  Journal,  and  other  Eastern  papers.  He  was  among 
the  victims  of  the  Lawrence  raid  of  May  21,  1856.  Besides  the  manuscripts 
mentioned,  Mr.  Hutchinson  has  given  from  his  collections  a  large  number 
of  pamphlets  and  newspapers  of  great  interest  as  containing  materials  of 
Kansas  history. 

Col.  Richard  J.  Hinton,  who  was  also  a  citizen  of  Kansas  during  the  ter- 
ritorial times,  as  an  active  newspaper  correspondent,  and  who  has  been  promi- 
nent in  literary  and  scientific  work  at  Washington  and  elsewhere  since,  has 
given  the  Society  many  valuable  manuscripts,  chiefly  of  Kansas  territorial 
and  war  history,  and  others  of  literary  interest.  Among  the  writers  of  these 
appear  the  names  of  President  Andrew  Jackson,  Martin  F.  Conway,  W.  D. 
Howells,  Jos.  Medill,  Fred.  P.  Stanton,  John  Swinton,  Gen.  John  McNeil, 
Gen.  S.  R.  Curtis,  Walt  Whitman,  Richard  Realf,  Edward  E.  Ropes,  Frank 
J.  Merriam,  and  S.  Hatch.  Colonel  Hinton  was  a  correspondent  of  the  New 
York  Tribune,  the  Chicago  Tribune,  and  other  papers.  He  is  the  author  of 
the  valuable  Kansas  book  entitled,  "  The  Army  of  the  Border,"  published  in 
1864,  and  which  c(mtains  a  very  full  history  of  the  raid  of  Gen.  Sterling 
Price,  which  threatened  the  destruction  of  Kansas,  and  which  was  repelled 
by  our  people.  With  the  manuscripts  are  also  given  newspapers,  newspaper 
clippings  and  other  papers  containing  matter  relating  to  the  Kansas  territor- 
ial history  and  the  history  of  the  civil  war. 

Orville  C.  Brown,  of  Adams,  N.  Y.,  has  given  many  manuscripts  and  j^apers 
of  much  historical  interest.  Mr.  Brown  was,  more  than  any  other  person,  the 
founder  of  Osawatomie,  having,  in  1854,  settled  there  with  the  company  that 
selected  the  town-site.  He  possessed  comparatively  large  means,  which  he 
-expended  in  improvements.  He  was  one  of  the  largest  sufferers  from  the  re- 
peated raids  which  were  made  by  Pro-Slavery  parties  upon  the  town  in  1856. 
The  manuscripts  given  relate  in  considerable  part  to  Mr.  Brown's  son,  Spen- 


Eighth  Biennial  Report. 


cer  Kellogg  Brown,  who,  a  boy  12  years  of  age,  was  taken  a  prisoner  into  Mis- 
souri at  the  sacking  of  Osawatomie,  August  30, 1856.  Young  Brown  became 
an  active  and  daring  soldier  in  the  War  of  the  Rebellion,  largely  in  scouting 
service.  He  was  finally  captured  by  Confederate  troops,  was  confined  for 
a  long  time  in  the  Mississippi  Penitentiary,  then  taken  to  Castle  Thunder, 
Richmond,  and  was  there  tried,  convicted  and  executed  as  a  spy,  under  cir- 
cumstances which  left  on  his  father's  mind  the  full  belief  of  his  innocence  of 
the  oflfense  for  which  his  life  was  sacrificed  in  the  cause  of  the  Union.  The 
manuscripts  and  other  materials  in  our  library  relating  to  the  history,  perils 
and  sacrifices  of  this  intrepid  boy  would  make  a  volume  of  thrilling  interest. 

From  J.  DeWitt  Walsh,  of  North  Topeka,  have  been  received  108  manu- 
script papers  of  the  late  Territorial  Secretary,  Hon.  Hugh  S.  Walsh,  relating 
to  the  Territorial  Legislature  of  1858  (the  first  Free-State  Legislature),  in- 
cluding vouchers  and  accounts  of  members  and  officers  of  the  Legislature;  of 
W.W.Ross,  legislative  printer;  and  of  numerous  persons  furnishing  supplies; 
certified  to  by  Gov.  J.  W.  Denver,  C.  W.  Babcock,  President  of  the  Council, 
G.  W.  Deitzler,  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  and  Geo.  F.  War- 
ren, Sergeant-at-Arms.  Included  in  this  gift  is  also  a  large  number  of  bills 
and  papers  relating  to  the  legislative  proceedings. 

Mr.  Samuel  Bernstein,  of  Cincinnati,  has  given  the  Society  a  copy  of  his 
eulogy  delivered  at  the  funeral  of  the  late  Col.  John  C.  Vaughan,  in  the 
chapel  of  the  Cincinnati  Crematory,  on  the  26th  of  September  last;  also  a 
copy  of  a  letter  written  by  Col.  Joseph  Medill,  of  Chicago,  containing  remi- 
niscenses  of  Colonel  Vaughan.  These,  with  other  papers  which  the  Society 
has  collected,  aflbrd  quite  full  materials  for  a  sketch  of  the  life  of  a  man  long 
prominent  in  the  history  of  Kansas,  and  who,  before  Kansas  had  a  history, 
had  made  a  national  reputation  as  connected  with  historical  events  of  great 
interest. 

PICTURES. 

The  pictures  added  to  the  collections  are  chiefly  portraits  of  citizens  of  the 
State  of  more  or  less  prominence  in  affairs  of  the  State's  history.  Ex-Gov. 
Samuel  J.  Crawford  has  added  to  our  portraits  of  former  chief  executives  of 
the  State  a  life-size,  oil-painted  portrait  of  himself,  by  Woodman.  The  John 
Brown  portraiture,  before  so  largely  represented  in  our  collections,  has  re- 
ceived the  accession,  by  gift  of  the  artist,  of  Woodman's  original  oil-painted 
portrait,  so  widely  known  through  the  engraved  copy  published  in  the  Cen- 
tury Magazine  in  1882.  Among  other  portrait  accessions,  the  following  are 
worthy  of  note  :  A  large,  life-like  photograph  of  the  late  Senator  Plumb,  the 
gift  of  Mrs.  Plumb ;  photograph  of  Hon.  A.  Carter  Wilder ;  of  Gen.  John 
A.  Halderman ;  Col.  R.  J.  Hinton ;  Lieut.  Gov.  Joseph  P.  Root ;  Col.  John 
C.  Vaughan ,  Sec.  Hugh  S.  Walsh ;  Rev.  Pardee  Butler ;  Rev.  S.  L.  Adair ; 
Horace  Greeley,  and  Oliver  Johnson.  Other  portraits  of  interest  will  be 
found  in  the  list,  elsewhere  in  this  report. 

In  our  lists  of  war  relics  and  miscellaneous  contributions  are  mentioned

tributed by  Prof.  I.  T.  Goodnow,  Col.  Richard  J.  Hinton,  Hon.  William 
Hutchinson,  and  others. 

CATALOGING. 

The  subject  of  cataloging  of  the  library  of  the  Society  is  one  to  which 
reference  is  again  to  be  made,  with  regret  that  no  catalog  volume  has  yet 
been  published.  The  work  of  preparing  such  a  volume  has  gone  forward 
with  as  much  activity  as  has  been  practicable  with  the  force  of  library  work- 
ers employed.  The  labor  of  cataloging  a  library  of  historical  materials, 
such  as  ours,  cannot  be  estimated  in  comparison  with  that  of  the  work  of 
cataloging  libraries  of  books  alone,  such  as  make  up  other  libraries.  Our 
library  of  Kansas  history  is  composed  of  an  innumerable  multitude  of  books, 
pamphlets,  magazines,  newspapers,  newspaper  scraps.  State  documents,  re- 
ports of  State  institutions,  reports  of  railroads,  and  charitable,  scientific  and 
many  other  societies.  All  these  our  Society  is  cataloging  in  full,  with  con- 
tents where  the  book  contains  a  variety  of  subjects,  and  with  bibliographical 
and  biographical  notes.  This  kind  of  cataloging  will  not  only  show  what 
the  library  contains,  but  wall  point  to  the  political,  literary,  social  and  scien- 
tific history  of  the  State.  Items  are  now  prepared  sufficient  for  a  catalog 
volume.     This  will  soon  be  published. 

world's  fair. 

On  application  to  the  Kansas  Board  of  Managers  for  the  World's  Colum- 
bian Exposition,  a  room  has  been  assigned  for  the  use  of  the  Society  in  the 
Kansas. building  at  Chicago  for  a  historical  exhibition.  The  Board  of  Di- 
rectors has  appointed  a  committee  to  take  into  consideration  the  subject  of 
the  kind  of  display  which  should  be  made  by  the  Society.  The  prominence 
which  Kansas  has,  during  nearly  40  years  past,  occupied  in  the  history  of  the 
country  makes  it  appropriate  that  our  State  should  have  a  full  representa- 
tion from  its  historical  collections  at  the  greatest  of  all  historical  expositions. 

REPUBLICATION. 

The  editions  of  the  earlier  volumes  of  the  collections  of  the  Society  have 
long  been  exhausted  and  should  be  republished.  The  editions  are  limited  to 
2,500  copies.  These  scarcely  serve  to  supply  the  demand  of  persons  whose 
names  appear  in  the  publications  as  donors  to  the  library  and  collections. 
There  is  a  large  demand  besides  which  can  only  be  partially  supplied.  Not 
only  should  the  out-of-print  editions  be  republished,  but  the  editions  of  future 
publications  should  be  larger.     The  Society  should  have  for  use  in  connection.

with  the  Kansas  World's  Columbian  Exposition  at  least  a  small  supply  of 
the  several  editions  of  its  publications,  in  effecting  exchanges  with  other  insti- 
tutions, and  in  supplying  other  imperative  demands. 

ROOM    FOR   THE   SOCIETY. 

The  subject  of  the  need  of  additional  room  for  the  library  and  collections 
of  the  Society  again  demands  mention  in  this  report.  For  the  proper  shelv- 
ing of  our  library  and  the  proper  placing  of  our  portraits  and  museum  col- 
lections, there  is  need  of  four  times  as  much  room  as  that  now  occupied.  Our 
Board  has  made  careful  estimates  of  our  needs.  The  library  materials  which 
the  Society  possesses  have  from  the  first  been  carefully  entered  upon  our  ac- 
cession records,  and  full  statements  of  their  number  and  character  have  been 
made  from  year  to  year  in  the  reports  of  the  Society.  Our  collections  now 
fill  every  nook  and  corner  of  the  main  room  of  the  Society,  from  floor  to 
ceiling;  they  occupy  cases  in  the  corridors,  and  they  occupy  three  rooms  in 
the  cellar  of  the  State  House.  This  library  and  these  collections  are  in  all 
respects  the  kind  of  materials  which  the  Society  is  by  law  required  to  gather 
into  the  State  Capitol  for  the  use  of  the  people.  They  do  not  consist  of  trash 
or  valueless  matter  in  any  respect.  They  consist  of  the  very  materials  which 
go  to  make  up  the  history  of  the  State  and  the  country.  One  single  room  in 
the  State  House  cellar,  only  reached  through  darkness,  grime,  and  dust,  con- 
tains upwards  of  5,000  volumes  of  papers,  which  contain  the  actual  history 
of  every  county  in  the  State  during  the  past  17  years,  and  in  large  part  the 
history  of  Kansas  for  all  the  years  from  the  earliest  settlement  of  Kansas 
Territory.  In  other  cellar  rooms  and  corridors  are  more  than  100  large  boxes 
of  books,  which  contain  the  actual  political  history  of  the  country  since  the 
foundation  of  the  Government.  The  amount  of  proper  library  space  which 
these  books  demand,  in  order  that  they  may  be  properly  placed,  is  determined 
by  the  well  established  rules  of  library  architecture  and  shelf  room.  It  is 
readily  shown  to  be  four  times  the  room  space  now  given  the  Society  in  the 
Capitol  building.  Our  large  collections  of  museum  relics,  of  intense  interest 
to  the  youth  and  masses  of  our  people,  are  so  crowded  and  huddled  into  the 
few  cases  which  our  scant  room  gives  them  that  they  cannot  be  seen  with  the 
least  satisfaction. 

The  Board  has  made  all  possible  eflTort  to  have  adequate  room  provided  for 
our  present  and  future  needs  in  the  Capitol  building  when  it  shall  be  com- 
pleted. No  designated  or  contemplated  rooms  for  the  Society  are  to  be  seen 
in  the  present  plans  of  the  building.  In  order  that  there  may  be  provision 
made,  our  Board  has  asked  from  the  State  Executive  Council  directions  to 
to  the  Board  of  Public  Works  and  State  Architect  to  reexamine  the  plans  of 
the  building,  together  with  such  assignments  as  are  contemplated  for  the  vari- 
ous departments  of  the  State,  with  a  view  to  determine  in  what  part  of  the 
building  rooms  may  yet  be  provided  for  the  Society.  It  is  hoped  that  this 
examination  will  be  made,  and  that  information  will  be  elicited  which  will 
lead  to  provision  for  adequate  accommodations  for  the  Society.

REPORT 


The  ninth  biennial  report  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Kansas  State 
Historical  Society  is  herewith  presented.  It  shows  the  work  of  the  Society 
during  the  two  years  from  November  15,  1892,  to  November  20,  1894.  Its 
publication  has  been  delayed  owing  to  deficiency  in  funds  in  the  state  i)rint- 
ing  department. 

This  Society  has  been  engaged  in  its  work  for  19  years.  For  this  period 
it  has  been  intrusted  by  the  people  of  the  state  with  the  duty  of  collecting 
the  scattered  materials  of  the  eventful  history  of  Kansas  and,  taking  these 
materials  as  a  basis  of  making  up  in  the  state  capitol  a  general  library  of 
reference  for  the  use  of  the  people.  The  Society  was  formed  by  the  Kansas 
State  Editorial  Association  in  1875.  That  association,  then  embracing  in 
one  body  a  large  representation  of  the  intelligent  and  thoughtful  people  of  the 
whole  state,  at  the  annual  meeting  held  at  Manhattan  in  April  of  that  year 
appointed  a  committee  to  organize  a  State  Historical  Society.  The  committee 
organized  this  Society.  Work  was  begun  by  the  beginning  of  the  centennial 
year  ( 1876).  That  year  the  collections  into  the  library  numbered  408  bound 
and  unbound  volumes,  including  volumes  of  newspaper  files.  From  this 
small  beginning  the  library  has  grown  to  the  number  of  79,900  volumes,  be- 
sides an  almost  innumerable  collection  of  manuscripts,  pictures,  and  historical 
relics  and  memorials  of  every  description. 

During  the  period  covered  by  the  report  there  have  been  added  to  the 
library  1,460  volumes  of  books;  5,346  unbound  volumes  and  pamphlets; 
2,776  volumes  of  newspapers  and  periodicals;  481  single  newspapers  con- 
taining matter  of  special  historical  interest;  326  maps,  atlases,  and  charts; 
2,891  manuscripts;  312  pictures  and  other  works  of  art;  17  pieces  of  scrip, 
currency,  and  coin  ;  2  war  relics  ;  and  387  miscellaneous  contributions. 

Thus,  to  the  library  proper,  of  books,  pamphlets,  newspapers,  and  period- 
icals, during  the  two  years  have  been  added  9,582  volumes.  Of  these,  9,073 
have  been  procured  by  gift  and  exchange,  and  509  by  purchase. 

The  total  of  the  library  at  the  present  time  is  as  follows:  15,874  bound 
volumes  of  books,  48,617  unbound  volumes  and  pamphlets,  15,409  bound 
newspaper  files  and  volumes  of  periodicals  ;  in  all,  79,900  volumes.

Of  the  accessions  of  books  and  pamphlets  during  the  two  years,  385  vol- 
umes have  been  purchased  and  6,421  have  come  by  gift  and  exchange.  Of 
newspapers  and  magazines,  189  volumes  have  been  purchased  and  2,587 
have  been  donated  to  the  Society.  The  lists  and  tables  in  the  report  show 
the  sources  from  which  all  the  accessions  of  the  different  classes  have  come . 

KANSAS    NEWSPAPERS. 

To  the  bound  volumes  of  newspapers  and  magazines  published  in  Kan- 
sas, 1,635  volumes  have  been  added  during  the  two  years.  These  have  all 
been  donated  to  the  Society  by  the  publishers.  The  library  now  contains 
on  its  shelves  10,689  bound  volumes  of  Kansas  newspapers  and  magazines. 
This  is  a  larger  collection  of  local  historical  materials  of  this  class  than  is 
contained  in  any  other  library  in  the  world.  Of  newspapers  and  maga- 
zines published  in  other  states,  the  library  contains  4,720  volumes. 

SOURCES  —  LEGAL    REQUIREMENTS. 

The  accessions  to  the  library  come  by  gift,  by  exchange,  and  by  purchase- 
Those  by  gift  and  exchange  come  largely  from  societies  and  institutions,  and 
from  state,  government,  municipal  and  other  public  authorities.  The  pur- 
chases come  from  booksellers.  These  three  means  of  building  up  the  library 
are  contemplated  in  the  law  which  recognized  our  Historical  Society  as  an 
institution  of  the  state  and  provided  for  its  maintenance  and  the  care  of  its 


NINTH  BIENNIAL  REP  OB  T. 


collections — the  act  of  the  legislature  of  1879.  In  the  language  of  the  act, 
it  is  the  duty  of  the  Society  to  procure,  "  by  gift  and  exchange,  scientific  and 
historical  reports  of  the  legislatures  of  other  states,  of  railroads,  reports  of 
geological  and  other  scientific  surveys,  and  of  such  other  books,  maps, 
charts,  and  materials  as  will  facilitate  the  investigation  of  historical,  scien- 
tific, social,  educational  and  literary  subjects,"  and  "to  purchase  books  to 
supply  deficiencies  in  tlie  various  departments  of  its  collections." 

The  Society  had  been  engaged  in  its  work  three  years  before  its  duties 
were  specifically  defined  by  law.  The  law  was  evolved  from  the  experience 
of  those  three  years.  With  little  money  expended,  by  1879  a  library  of 
4,300  volumes  had  been  made  up  by  the  Society  in  the  statehouse.  It  had 
grown  almost  wholly  from  gifts  and  exchanges.  Now  the  state  by  law  pro- 
vided for  the  care  of  the  library,  and  for  its  future  growth.  To  enable  the 
Society  to  augment  its  collections  through  exchanges,  the  legislature  pro- 
vided that,  with  one  exception,  there  should  be  given  it  60  bound  copies  of 
all  of  the  publications  of  the  state  and  of  its  institutions.  It  made  the 
Society  "  the  trustee  of  the  state,"  imposed  upon  it  definite  duties  in  the  dis- 
charge of  its  trust,  and,  with  the  Society's  consent,  took  its  library  and  col- 
lections into  its  keeping  as  the  property  of  the  state. 

The  legislature  made  it  the  duty  of  the  Society  to  continue  as  hitherto  in 
its  work  of  making  up  a  library  of  reference  in  history,  science,  education, 
politics,  and  in  the  various  departments  of  human  knowledge,  by  soliciting 
gifts  and  making  exchanges,  and  by  purchasing  such  books  as  might  be 
necessary  to  supply  the  deficiencies  in  the  various  departments.  Purchases 
had  become  quite  necessary.  A  foundation  had  been  made  for  a  large 
library  of  general  reference  in  all  departments.  Experience  had  shown  that 
the  growth  by  gift  and  exchange  was  resulting  in  making  a  library  very 
incomplete  in  its  various  departments.  As  a  consequence,  in  the  use  of  the 
library,  there  would  be  found  but  incomplete  sets  of  books  upon  any  subject 
of  investigation.  The  law,  for  this  reason,  provided  that  purchases  should 
be  made  to  supply  the  deficiencies  in  such  sets,  so  that  a  well-rounded  and 
well-filled  library  of  reference  should  be  made  up  for  the  use  of  students, 
investigators,  and  writers  upon  all  subjects  of  common  inquiry. 

PURCHASES   INSUFFICIENT. 

Up  to  the  present  time,  the  appropriations  for  purchases  have  been  wholly 
inadequate  to  supply  deficiencies.  They  have  been  usually  but  S500  annually. 
This  is  a  trifling  and  insignificant  amount  compared  with  the  accessions  by 
gift,  and  compared  with  what  is  being  expended  by  other  states  for  such  pur- 
chases. Wisconsin,  Minnesota,  Illinois,  and  Iowa,  for  example,  give  for  the 
purchase  of  books  for  their  historical  libraries  from  S3,000  to  $5,000  an- 
nually. 

Take  one  class  of  gifts  alone  —  that  of  newspapers  and  magazines.  The 
newspaper  publishers  of  Kansas  are  giving  to  the  library,  annually,  about 
860  volumes.     These,  at  the  rates  paid  by  subscribers,  would  give  to  the  pub- 


STATE  HISTORICAL  SOCIETY. 


lishers  an  aggregate  of  at  least  $1,000  per  year.  This  sum  is  thus  being  do- 
nated annually  to  the  state  by  one  class  of  our  citizens  to  aid  in  building  up 
the  historical  library  of  Kansas.  The  generosity  of  these  givers  stands  in 
striking  contrast  with  the  meagerness  of  the  state  appropriations  for  acces- 
sions to  the  library.  This  library  is  for  the  use  of  all  the  people  of  the  state. 
No  other  part  of  the  library  is  being  so  much  consulted  as  are  the  newspaper 
files.  In  them,  search  is  made  by  citizens  of  all  parts  of  the  state  for  legal 
notices,  for  dates  and  details  of  occurrence  of  events,  for  facts  concerning  the 
organization  and  movement  of  political  and  social  bodies,  and,  in  fact,  con- 
cerning all  the  numberless  subjects  which  enter  into  the  busy  life  of  our  peo- 
ple, and  which  find  so  full  a  record  in  our  local  newspapers. 

Our  library  contains  the  files  of  the  newspapers  of  every  county  in  the 
state.  Considering  the  small  proportion  in  numbers  which  the  class  of  news- 
paper publishers  bears  to  the  number  of  citizens  of  the  state  at  large,  the 
generosity  of  the  one  class  by  no  means  finds  proper  recognition.  These  news- 
paper people  were  the  founders  of  the  State  Historical  Society.  To  them  the 
;state  owes  the  existence  of  a  library  already  unequaled,  in  the  value  of  its 
local  historical  material,  by  that  of  any  state  of  the  union.  It  is  certainly 
demanded  that  the  state  should  respond  to  the  liberality  of  the  newspaper 
publishers,  by  adequate  appropriations  for  making  this  library  complete  in 
all  its  departments. 

NEWSPAPERS   AS    MATERIALS    OF    HISTORY. 

It  cannot  be  said  that  these  newspaper  files  are  not  worth  in  this  library 
the  price  of  their  subscription  rates.  They  contain  the  history  of  Kansas. 
No  part  of  Kansas  history  can  be  written  without  consulting  these  files. 
Hon.  Nelson  Case,  of  Oswego,  the  author  of  the  recently  published  history 
of  Labette  county,  one  of  the  most  complete  histories  yet  written  of  any 
Kansas  county,  says: 

"  I  think  that  anyone  who  has  considered  the  matter,  and  especially  any- 
one who  has  had  any  experience  in  writing  local  history,  will  agree  with  me 
in  saying  there  is  no  help  so  complete  and  accurate  as  the  home  newspaper 
in  giving  the  happenings  in  any  community." 

Says  Hon.  John  Maloy,  the  very  capable  historian  of  Morris  county : 

"Speaking  of  the  importance  of  the  newspaper  files  in  your  Society's 
rooms,  I  do  not  think  the  history  of  any  county  in  our  state  could  be  writ- 
ten without  consulting  them.  ...  I  could  not  now  do  anything  in  the 
way  of  sketching  the  history,  biography  or  incidents  of  Morris  county 
without  having  recourse  to  the  files  of  your  library.  I  regard  the  State 
Historical  Society  as  one  of  the  indispensable  institutions  of  our  state ;  one, 
however,  too  little  appreciated  and  too  begrudgingly  aided  and  fostered  by 
legislation." 

In  a  recent  article  in  the  Forum  magazine,  President  Eliot,  of  Harvard 
University,  says  of  the  American  newspapers  of  the  present  time,  that, 
"  Taken  together  with  magazines  and  the  controversial  pamphlets,  they 


NINTH  BIENNIAL  EEPOBT. 


shed  more  light  on  the  social,  industrial  and  political  life  of  the  people  of 
the  United  States  than  was  ever  shed  before  on  the  doings  and  ways  of  any 
people.  Many  people,"  he  says,  "  are  in  the  habit  of  complaining  bitterly 
of  the  intrusion  of  the  newspaper  reporter  into  every  nook  and  corner  of  the 
state,  and  even  into  the  privacy  of  the  home ;  but  in  this  extreme  publicity 
is  to  be  found  the  means  of  social,  industrial  and  governmental  reform  and 
progress." 

The  newspaper  which  thus  enlightens  the  public  becomes  an  enduring 
record  of  history  when  preserved  in  a  library.  It  carries  down  to  the  suc- 
ceeding generations  the  story  of  the  social,  industrial  and  political  life  of 
the  people,  as  the  world  moves  forward  in  change  and  progress.  For  Kansas,, 
all  the  newspapers  published  in  the  state  are  thus  being  preserved.  A  news- 
paper association  established  the  Society,  and  newspaper  publishers  are  mak- 
ing the  most  valuable  additions  to  its  library. 

Our  Society  stands  foremost  among  the  historical  societies  in  this  country 
in  the  work  of  saving  newspapers  as  materials  of  local  history.  Various 
causes  have  prompted  the  Society  to  diligence  and  thoroughness  in  this  work ; 
chiefly,  that  the  Society  was  established  by  newspaper  men  ;  that  the  news- 
paper men  of  the  state  have  always  comprised  the  principal  membership  of 
the  Society ;  and  that  they  have  always  taken  a  pride  and  interest  in  the 
work  which  the  Society  is  doing  for  the  state.  Historical  societies  and  libra-, 
rians  have  always  valued  this  library  feature.  But  it  would  seem  that  never,, 
until  iu'  the  instance  of  our  Society,  has  an  institution  been  so  constituted  as 
that  sufficient  attention  and  labor  have  been  given  to  this  department  to  make 
its  work  thorough  and  complete. 

Twenty-two  years  ago,  Hon.  A.  R.  Spoffbrd,  the  distiiiguished  librarian  of 
Congress,  the  foremost  of  all  library  makers,  said,  in  the  Centennial  History 
of  Libraries  in  the  United  States,  1876 : 

"The  modern  newspapers  and  other  periodical  publications  afford  the 
truest,  the  fullest,  and,  on  the  whole,  the  most  impartial  image  of  the  age  we 
live  in  that  can  be  derived  from  any  single  source.  Taken  together,  they 
afford  the  richest  materials  for  the  historian,  or  the  student  of  politics,  of  so- 
ciety, of  literature,  and  of  civilization  in  its  various  aspects.  What  precious 
memorials  of  the  day  even  the  advertisements  and  brief  paragraphs  of  the 
newspapers  of  a  century  ago  afford  us.     .     .     . 

"  While  the  files  of  the  journals  of  any  period  furnish  unquestionably  the 
best  instruments  for  the  history  of  that  epoch,  it  is  lamentable  to  reflect  that 
so  little  care  has  ever  been  taken  to  preserve  a  fair  representation  of  those  of 
any  age.  The  destiny  of  nearly  all  newspapers  is  swift  destruction,  and  even 
those  which  are  preserved  commonly  survive  in  a  provokingly  fragmentary 
state.  These  poor  journals  of  to-day,  which  everybody  is  ready  to  stigma- 
tize as  trash,  not  worth  the  room  to  store  or  the  money  to  bind,  are  the  very 
materials  which  the  man  of  the  future  will  search  for  with  eagerness,  and  for 
some  of  which  he  will  be  ready  to  pay  their  weight  in  gold.  These  represent- 
atives of  the  commercial,  industrial,  inventive,  social,  literary,  political, 
moral  and  religious  life  of  the  times  should  be  preserved  and  handed  down 
to  posterity  with  sedulous  care.  No  historian,  or  other  writer  on  any  sub- 
ject, who  would  write  conscientiously  or  with  full  information,  can  afford  to

neglect  this  fruitful  mine  of  the  journals,  where  his  richest  materials  are  fre- 
quently to  be  found." 

Said  our  own  lamented  governor,  John  A.  Martin,  referring  to  the  files 
of  his  own  newspaper,  afterwards  mainly  destroyed  by  fire: 

''iPiled  up  in  the  corner  of  the  Champion  office  is  the  most  complete  his- 
tory of  Atchison  that  will  ever  be  written.  It  is  comprised  in  35  bound 
volumes  of  the  Chmnjnon,  weekly  and  daily,  from  the  first  issue  made  by 
the  present  proprietor,  February  20,  1858,  up  to  the  present  time.  In  these 
papers  —  many  of  them  beginning  to  take  on  the  yellow  hue  of  age  —  every 
essential  fact  connected  with  the  growth  and  development  and  daily  life  of 
the  city  of  Atchison  is  recorded  —  marriages  and  deaths;  the  establishment 
of  business  and  manufacturing  enterprises,  and  their  changes ;  transfers  of 
property ;  the  erection  of  all  important  buildings ;  the  results  of  elections ; 
the  opening  of  streets;  the  building  of  railroads;  fires  and  floods;  the  mu- 
nicipal policies  suggested,  discussed,  and  adopted ;  and  the  daily  life, 
thoughts,  hopes,  triumphs  and  disappointments  of  an  aspiring  and  energetic 
community  are  all  embodied  in  these  files." 

SOME   CLASSES    OF   BOOKS. 

It  must  not  be  thought  that  our  Society,  in  its  high  appreciation  of  its 
newspaper  work,  is  neglecting  other  departments.  Within  its  means,  it  is 
making  up  a  very  full  library  of  reference  in  every  department.  luto  this 
library  is  being  brought  everything  published  in  Kansas  upon  all  subjects. 
In  its  general  library,  it  is  becoming  very  full  in  works  relating  to  the  dis- 
covery, exploration  and  settlement  of  the  Western  country,  and  of  this  class 
contains  no  less  than  835  volumes;  in  works  relating  to  Indian  history, 
442  volumes;  in  general  history.  United  States  history,  and  the  history  of 
the  several  states,  we  possess  2,875  volumes;  in  biography,  1,026  volumes; 
in  science,  4,088  volumes;  in  education,  1,956  volumes;  in  political  science 
and  political  economy,  3,910  volumes;  relating  to  trade  and  commerce,  1,120 
volumes;  to  agriculture,  1,154  volumes;  in  religion,  1,206  volumes;  relating 
to  charitable  subjects,  1,417  volumes. 

The  history  of  this  country  during  the  last  40  years  has  hinged  upon  the 
history  of  Kansas.  The  industry  and  efficiency  of  the  Kansas  State  Histor- 
ical Society,  in  collecting  the  materials  of  Kansas  history  and  of  the  history 
of  the  country  in  all  respects,  has  attracted  the  attention  of  appreciative  people 
everywhere.  Hence,  around  our  nucleus  of  local  history  has  grown  up, 
mainly  by  gift  and  exchange,  the  publications  of  almost  every  society  and 
institution  throughout  this  country  and  of  many  in  the  old  world.  The  lists 
of  donations  contained  in  our  ninth  biennial  report  show  that  accessions, 
chiefly  of  books  and  pamphlets,  come  from  more  than  a  thousand  different 
sources. 

WAR   BOOKS. 

In  respect  to  special  features  of  library  collections,  there  are  two  classes  of 
books  in  which  the  library  should  be  made  very  complete :  First,  all  books 
written  about  Kansas  history,  and  books  of  Kansas  authorship  of  all  kinds ; 


Ninth  Biennial  Eepobt.  11 

and  second,  books  written  upon  the  history  of  the  war  of  the  rebellion.  As 
to  the  first  class,  the  library  is  being  made  complete  by  the  generous  gifts  of 
Kansas  authors  and  publishers.  In  resj^ect  to  the  latter  class,  it  is  far  from 
being  made  complete.  It  may  be  said  that  the  period  of  the  early  history  of 
Kansas,  during  which  our  people  struggled  through  unsurpassed  difficulties 
into  a  state  existence,  was  but  a  prelude  to  the  war  of  the  rebellion.  The 
war  for  the  preservation  of  the  union  and  of  its  free  institutions  raged  for  six 
years  in  Kansas ;  was  fought  almost  single-handed  here  by  our  pioneer  set- 
tlers before  it  was  taken  up  by  the  nation  and  fought  out  to  its  glorious  end. 
Every  well-written  book  pertaining  to  the  war  should  be  brought  into  the 
state  historical  library.  A  nucleus  for  such  a  library  of  war  history 
has  been  gathered  in,  numbering  511  volumes.  There  are  yet  hundreds  of 
volumes  pertaining  to  the  details  of  the  war,  written  in  large  part  by  the  ac- 
tors in  it,  which  should  be  brought  into  the  library  in  order  that  it  shall  be 
made  a  complete  library  of  reference  as  to  the  history  of  the  great  epoch  in 
which  Kansas  history  formed  so  considerable  a  feature.  A  very  moderate 
estimate  would  call  for  a  present  expenditure  of  a  sum  of  not  less  than  $1,000 
for  the  purchase  of  books  of  this  class. 

SPECIAL   GIFTS. 

Of  the  2,891  manuscript  papers  and  books  of  special  interest  given  the 
Society  during  the  two  years,  may  be  mentioned  those  given  by  Mr.  Orville 
C.  Brown,  of  Adams,  N.  Y.  Mr.  Brown  was,  more  than  any  other  person, 
the  founder  of  Osawatomie.  He  was  a  prominent  citizen  of  Kansas  during 
the  entire  territorial  period,  and  active  in  public  aflTairs  in  many  useful  ways. 
He  met  with  serious  losses  from  pro-slavery  depredations  and  outrages.  His 
manuscripts  given  the  Society  relate,  in  large  part,  to  matters  of  early  Kan- 
sas history. 

Hon.  J.  C.  Burnett  gives  some  interesting  papers  relating  to  political 
affairs  at  important  crises  in  Kansas  histor3^ 

Prof.  I.  T.  Goodnow  before  his  death,  which  occurred  less  than  a  year 
ago,  added  to  his  former  gifts  many  manuscripts  of  much  interest  relating 
to  public  affairs  in  the  later  '50s,  especially  relating  to  the  founding  of  the 
State  Agricultural  College  —  an  institution  to  the  establishment  of  which  he, 
perhaps,  contributed  more  of  wise  effort  than  any  other  person. 

Gen.  John  A.  Halderman  has  again  given  bountifully  from  his  stores  of 
papers  saved  through  a  long  period  of  public  life,  extending  from  the  earliest 
Kansas  days  to  the  present  time.  -Among  these  papers  are  many  letters 
written  by  Gov.  Andrew  H.  Reeder  and  other  prominent  public  men  of 
Kansas  territorial  times,  and  by  many  others  in  different  parts  of  this  coun- 
try and  of  the  world. 

The  manuscript  papers  of  the  late  Hon.  James  Hanway,  which  have  for 
a  number  of  years  been  in  the  possession  of  the  Society  as  a  conditional  de- 
posit, have,  through  the  generosity  of  his  son,  Mr.  John  S.  Hanway,  of  Lane, 


12  State  Histobical  society. 

been  brought  permanently  into  the  collections  of  the  Society.  These  papers 
are  of  great  interest  as  reflecting  the  life  work  of  an  earnest  student,  indus- 
trious writer,  and  faithful  public  servant,  for  many  years  an  active  citizen  of 
Kansas  and  a  zealous  promoter  of  her  best  institutions. 

Col.  R.  J.  Hinton  has  contributed  important  additions  to  his  former  gifts,  , 
including  many  papers  relating  to  early  Kansas  free-state  immigration,  to 
measures  of  resistance  against  pro-slavery  aggression,  to  John  Brown  his- 
tory, and  to  the  war  of  the  rebellion. 

Rev.  J.  D.  Knox  has  given  valuable  manuscript  papers  and  books  re- 
lating to  the  history  of  the  freedmen's  exodus  from  the  Southern  states  to 
Kansas,  and  to  the  work  of  the  Kansas  Freedmen's  Relief  Associatiou  in 
caring  for  the  exiles  in  1879-'81 . 

Miss  Eva  Ryan,  of  Hiawatha,  has  given  some  autograph  poems  of  the 
late  Mrs.  Ellen  P.  Allerton. 

J.  B.  Whitaker,  of  Topeka,  has  given  a  large  number  of  official  papers, 
which  illustrate  the  methods  of  the  pro-slavery  party  in  harassing  and  per- 
secuting free-state  settlers. 

The  Kansas  Baptist  convention,  at  its  late  session  at  Winfield,  upon  the 
suggestion  of  Rev.  J.  B.  Thomas,  of  Topeka,  voted  to  place  the  important 
papers  of  the  convention,  not  needed  for  immediate  use,  in  the  custody  of 
our  Society.  These  have  been  brought  into  our  collections,  numbering  261 
pamphlets,  containing  the  minutes  and  proceedings  of  Kansas  Baptist 
associations  and  conventions;  2,202  manuscript  papers,  and  37  manuscript 
books.  Mr.  Thomas  contributed  from  his  own  collection  72  pamphlets. 
This  denomination  publishes  more  largely  than  any  other  the  proceedings  of 
its  local  organizations. 

This  is  the  third  instance  in  which  ecclesiastical  bodies  of  Kansas  have 
chosen  to  place  in  our  state  archives  the  materials  of  the  early  history  of 
their  organization  and  work.  The  two  former  deposits  were  made  by  confer- 
ences of  the  Methodist  Episcopal  church  —  the  parent  organization,  the  Kan- 
sas Conference,  and  the  South  Kansas  conference.  Church  organizations 
have  always  been  powerful  promoters  of  the  immigration  of  the  better  class 
of  settlers  into  the  new  states.  The  circumstances  attending  the  settlement 
of  our  own  state  invited  the  incoming  of  people  imbued  with  religious  prin- 
ciples and  enthusiasm.  The  organizations  of  these  bodies  were  effected  at 
the  time  our  earliest  political  organizations  were  being  formed.  The  minis- 
ters of  the  churches  were  among  the  active  men  in  political  movements. 
The  nature  of  their  calling  brought  theltn  into  the  closest  relations  with  the 
people  in  their  homes,  in  their  social  intercourse,  in  their  educational  move- 
ments, and  in  all  the  higher  relations  of  our  best  elements  of  civilization. 
The  history  of  Kansas  churches  is,  in  large  part,  the  history  of  the  better 
Kansas.  Our  Society  has  reason  to  feel  a  great  degree  of  gratification  at  the 
confidence  reposed  in  it  as  the  custodian  of  the  records  of  these  bodies. 
Taken  together  with  the  very  large  body  of  original  records  of  the  work  of 


Ninth  Biennial  Repobt.  18 

the  early  missionaries  of  Kansas,  of  Meeker,  McCoy,  Pratt,  Johnson,  Sim- 
merwell,  and  others,  which  have  been  brought  into  our  library,  and  of  which 
frequent  mention  has  been  made  in  these  reports,  it  may  be  doubted  if  any 
library  in  the  Mississippi  valley  now  contains  so  great  a  fund  of  materials 
of  missionary  and  religious  history  as  are  crowded  into  our  limited  fireproof 
receptacle.  The  scantiness  of  the  room  for  the  placing  of  these  precious 
memorials  calls  loudly  for  more  ample  provision  for  their  keeping. 

Kev.  Lewis  Bodwell,  of  Clifton  Springs,  N.  Y.,  has  given  the  Society  a 
very  interesting  set  of  views  of  the  oldest  Congregational  church  buildings 
erected  in  Kansas,  together  with  portraits  of  the  pastors  and  their  wives. 
Rev.  L,  P.  Broad,  included  in  a  large  gift  of  materials  showing  his  recent 
work  as  missionary  of  the  Congregational  churches  in  Kansas,  has  also  given 
pictures  of  two  Congregational  churches,  one  of  them  that  of  a  sod  church  in 
Osborne  county. 

An  interesting  relic  of  war  history  is  a  map  made  by  Col.  William  Tweed- 
dale,  of  Topeka,  showing  the  mode  of  construction  of  the  New  Madrid  canal, 
a  device  which  led  to  the  capture  of  Island  No.  10,  in  the  Mississippi  river, 
April  7,  1862.  The  canal  was  planned  by  the  donor  of  this  map  and  it  was 
constructed  under  his  supervision. 

In  this  connection  may  be  mentioned  a  set  of  church  charts  brought  into 
the  library  through  the  World's  Columbian  Exposition.  These  charts  con- 
tain data  and  statistics  pertaining  to  the  founding  and  history  of  178  churches 
and  Sunday  schools  of  all  denominations  in  the  various  counties  of  Kansas, 
in  many  instances  with  portraits  of  pastors  and  views  of  church  edifices. 
These  form  a  unique  and  interesting  collection  of  materials  of  Kansas  church 
history.  In  the  gathering  of  this  history  an  ingenious  blank  chart  devised 
by  Mrs,  J.  C.  Trotter,  of  Wichita,  has  been  used.  Mrs.  A.  M.  Clark,  secre- 
tary of  the  AVorld's  Fair  board  of  managers,  is  deserving  of  great  credit  for 
the  interest  taken  by  her  in  bringing  these  charts  into  our  library. 

Orville  C.  Brown,  of  Adams,  N.  Y.,  has  given  a  large  number  of  interest- 
ing views  and  portraits.  Supt.  W.  M.  Davidson,  of  Topeka,  has  given  a 
large  number  of  views  of  schoolhouses  in  different  portions  of  the  state. 
Warren  Foster,  of  Hutchinson,  has  placed  in  our  collection  a  very  interest- 
ing memorial  descriptive  of  Abraham  Lincoln's  home  in  Kentucky  and  re- 
lating to  his  marriage.  Col.  R.  J.  Hinton  has  given  an  interesting  collection 
of  John  Brown  portraiture.  A  very  fine  portrait  of  the  late  Hon.  John  C. 
Vaughan  has  been  given  the  Society  by  Hon.  Joseph  Medill,  of  Chicago. 

A  life-sized  portrait  of  Governor  Lewelling  has  been  added  to  our  collec- 
tion of  portraits  of  Kansas  governors,  the  gift  of  friends  of  the  governor 
among  the  state  officers  and  others. 

A  fine  oil-painted  portrait  of  the  late  Henry  J.  Adams,  the  gift  of  mem- 
bers of  his  family,  has  also  come  into  the  collections.  Mr.  Adams  was 
among  the  most  prominent  of  the  early  settlers  of  Kansas,  was  elected  gov- 
ernor under  the  Leavenworth  constitution  in  1858,  and  held  many  positions 
of  honor  and  trust.     The  portrait  is  the  work  of  the  artist  George  M.  Stone. 


14  State  Historical  society. 

In  compliance  with  the  request  of  the  Society,  Maj.  James  S.  Phillips,  of 
the  U.  S.  navy,  has  added  to  our  picture  gallery  a  fine  oil-painted  portrait  of 
his  father,  the  late  Col.  Wm.  A.  Phillips. 

Messrs.  Pennell  &amp;  Zellner,  photographers,  Junction  City,  have  contributed 
some  excellent  views  taken  at  Fort  Riley  and  vicinity,  and  H.  S.  Stevenson, 
photographer,  Leavenworth,  has  given  like  views  of  the  vicinity  of  Leaven- 
worth and  the  fort. 

Dr.  L.  F.  Went  worth,  of  Osawatomie,  has  added  to  our  picture  collection 
a  very  fine  set  of  views  taken  at  Osawatomie,  including  those  of  the  build- 
ings of  the  state  insane  asylum,  representing  various  stages  of  the  history  of 
the  growth  of  that  institution,  a  view  of  the  John  Brown  monument,  also  of 
the  house  of  Rev.  S.  L.  Adair,  built  by  him  in  1855,  in  which  he  still  re- 
sides, and  in  which  John  Brown  made  his  home  during  his  tarrying  in 
Osawatomie,  from  1855  to  1859. 

Valuable  newspaper  files  have  been  given  by  Hon.  Joel  K.  Goodin,  of 
Ottawa,  John  S.  Han  way,  of  Lane,  A.  S.  Huling,  of  Topeka,  V.  J.  Lane,  of 
Kansas  City,  Z.  F.  Riley  and  F.  A.  Root,  of  Topeka,  Gov.  A.  J.  Smith,  of  the 
soldiers'  home,  Leavenworth,  Mrs.  Jenny  M.  Ward,  of  Ottawa,  and  others. 

An  interesting  relic  of  the  barbarism  from  which  our  country  escaped 
during  the  period  of  the  history  of  Kansas,  is  a  slave  shackle  taken  by  Jo- 
seph McFarland,  now  of  Wichita,  from  the  ankle  of  a  negro  slave  in  Missouri, 
a  short  time  before  the  war  of  the  rebellion,  and  brought  by  donor  to  Kansas 
and  deposited  by  him  in  the  collections  of  our  Society.  Geo.  J.  Remsburg, 
of  Atchison,  has  added  to  his  former  gifts  of  mound-builders'  relics.  R.  J. 
Traver,  of  Leoti,  has  given  some  very  interesting  relics  from  an  Indian  bur- 
ial receptacle  in  Wichita  county. 

Capt.  P.  H.  Coney  has  added  interesting  relics  of  the  Lapland  exhibit  at 
the  World's  Fair.  Many  interesting  relics  of  the  investment  of  the  state- 
house  by  the  state  militia  in  February,  1893,  have  been  given  by  various 
persons  of  the  different  parties  w^ho  took  part  in  the  interesting  events  of  that 
brief  period ;  among  these  is  the  sledge  hammer  used  by  Speaker  George  L. 
Douglass  in  opening  the  door  of  the  house  of  representatives,  and  which  has 
been  deposited  by  him  in  our  collections. 

Among  the  objects  of  interest  displayed  at  the  World's  Columbian  'Expo- 
sition, at  Chicago,  several  have  been  deposited  in  the  collections  of  our  His- 
torical Society.  Among  them  may  be  mentioned  that  deposited  by  Mrs. 
Elizabeth  Magie,  of  Girard,  for  the  Grand  Chapter  of  the  Order  of  the 
Eastern  Star  in  Kansas,  being  a  large  banner,  in  an  elaborately  carved  oak 
frame,  and  showing  on  its  face  representations  of  the  local  chapters  through- 
out the  state ;  an  elegant  banner  deposited  by  the  Woman's  Columbian  Club 
of  Jewell  county,  at  the  hands  of  Mrs.  A.  M.  Clark ;  a  fine  carved  and  up- 
holstered chair,  exhibited  by  the  Woman's  Columbian  Club  of  Nemaha 
county,  and  deposited  by  Mrs.  Mary  E.  Todd,  secretary ;  design  executed  on 
oak,  in  carved  work  and  oils,  for  the  Woman's  Relief  Corps,  department  of

OBITUARY. 

During  the  last  two  years  death  has  made  sad  inroads  upon  the  promi- 
nent membership  of  the  Society. 

Col.  William  A.  Phillips  died  November  30,  1893,  at  Fort  Gibson,  while 
on  a  business  trip  to  the  Indian  Territory.  He  had  always  been  a  promi- 
nent figure  in  Kansas  history  and  had  been  President  of  this  Society.  Me- 
morial proceedings  were  had  at  the  annual  meeting  in  1894. 

Hon.  Timothy  Dwight  Thacher  died  January  17,  1894.  He  had  been  a 
citizen  of  Kansas,  with  only  a  brief  absence,  since  1857,  and  had  all  the 
time  taken  a  leading  part  in  public  affairs.  He  had  been  President  of  the 
Society,  and  always  one  of  the  most  useful  counselors  in  the  conduct  of  its 
work. 

Joseph  C.  Hebbard  died  January  22,  1894.  He  was  an  early  citizen  of 
Kansas,  and  an  early  member  of  this  Society  and  of  its  Board  of  Directors. 
As  a  journalist,  he  had  learned  to  value,  more  perhaps  than  any  other,  the 
collections  of  the  Society,  as  furnishing  data  upon  which  to  base  exact  state- 
ments in  journalistic  work  in  all  matters  pertaining  to  Kansas.  His  loss  to 
the  Society  cannot  be  estimated. 

Prof  Isaac  T.  Goodnow  died  March  20,  1894.  He  was  one  of  the  earliest 
settlers  in  Kansas,  and  was  one  of  the  numerous  class  who  came  to  the  new 
territory  with  the  high  purpose  of  aiding  to  establish  good  institutions  in  the 
new  state  to  be  founded.  He  came  well  equipped  in  learning  and  maturity 
of  good  character  to  perform  a  useful  part  in  carrying  out  such  aims.  Dur- 
ing his  life  here  he  occupied  many  positions  of  honor  and  usefulness.  He 
was  one  of  the  most  active  members  of  the  State  Historical  Society,  and  one 
of  the  most  bountiful  contributors  to  its  collections. 

Ex-Gov.  James  M.  Harvey  died  April  15,  1894.  He  was  a  Kansas 
soldier  in  the  war  for  the  preservation  of  the  union,  a  legislator,  for  two 
terms  governor  of  the  state,  and  a  United  States  senator  from  Kansas.  For 
a  number  of  years  he  was  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  this  Society, 
and  always  manifested  an  interest  in  its  work. 

Ex-Gov.  Charles  Robinson  died  August  17,  1894.  His  name,  from  the 
very  beginning  of  the  settlement  up  to  the  day  of  his  death,  was  con- 
spicuously linked  with  the  history  of  Kansas.  He  ranked  foremost  among 
the  founders  of  the  state,  and  for  more  than  a  generation  was  one  of  the  most

prominent  of  its  leading  citizens.  One  of  the  earliest  Presidents  of  thi&amp; 
Society,  he  was  always  among  the  most  useful  of  its  members.  At  our  last 
annual  meeting  he  was  present  with  the  Board  of  Directors,  of  which  he  had 
always  been  a  member,  and  took  an  active  and  interested  part  in  the  pro- 
ceedings. 

Memorial  proceedings  respecting  these  late  distinguished  members  of  our 
Society  have  been  initiated  by  our  Board  of  Directors. 

PHONOGRAPH. 

The  Board  has  ventured  upon  an  experiment  with  the  Edison  phonograph 
as  a  means  of  making  and  preserving  historical  records.  The  experiment 
has  been  carried  to  the  extent  of  procuring  the  records  of  the  voices  of  Ex- 
Governors  Crawford,  Osborn,  Glick,  and  Lewelling,  and  of  Chief  Justice 
Horton.  Unfortunately,  Governor  Robinson  was  not  reached  in  time  to  pro- 
cure a  record  of  his  voice ;  but,  upon  request,  Mrs.  Robinson  consented  to 
read  into  the  phonograph  a  portion  of  Governor  Robinson's  inaugural  ad- 
dress ;  and  thus  her  voice  was  put  on  record  in  lieu  of  that  of  her  recently 
deceased  husband's.  Brief  extracts  from  the  inaugural  or  other  official  ad- 
dresses have  been  recorded  upon  phonographic  cylinders,  to  be  preserved  for 
use  at  any  time,  and  for  all  time,  as  unique  historical  records  of  the  voices  of 
the  representative  officers  of  the  state  in  the  earlier  period  of  her  history.  It 
is  for  the  Society  and  the  legislature  to  determine  whether  the  experiment 
has  so  far  demonstrated  the  utility  of  this  mode  of  preserving  history  as  to 
warrant  its  continuance,  within  such  prudent  limits  as  may  be  established. 

ROOMS. 

The  subject  of  rooms  for  the  accommodation  of  the  library  and  collec- 
tions of  the  Historical  Society  is  still  one  of  the  most  important  that  can 
engage  the  Society's  attention.  The  legislature  at  its  last  session,  1 893,  granted 
three  additional  rooms,  in  the  south  wing  of  the  statehouse,  and  made  an  ap- 
propriation for  furniture  and  shelving  for  the  same.  These  added  rooms,, 
though  far  short  of  supplying  our  present  needs,  have  greatly  facilitated  the 
placing  of  the  library  and  the  general  work  of  the  Society. 

The  grant  was  made  under  a  concurrent  resolution  in  the  following 
words  : 

Resolved,  That  the  rooms  now  occupied  by  the  supreme  court  commis- 
sioners, in  the  basement  of  the  south  wing  of  the  capitol  building,  be  assigned 
for  the  additional  and  temporary  use  of  the  State  Historical  Society,  and 
that  it  shall  be  the  duty  of  the  state  executive  council  to  cause  suitable 
shelving  and  furniture  to  be  immediately  supplied  to  said  rooms  for  such  use. 

The  ^Society  began  its  work  nearly  19  years  ago,  without  need  of  room,  ex- 
cept desk  room  for  the  Secretary  and  room  for  a  bookcase.  These  simple 
needs  were  found  in  the  state  offices,  generously  and  encouragingly  given. 
From  time  to  time  since,  as  needs  demanded  and  as  far  as  the  unfinished  con- 
dition of  the  statehouse  would  admit,  rooms  have  been  provided,  so  that  now 


NINTH  BIENNIAL  REPORT.  17 

the  Society  occupies  more  room  than  any  other  department  in  the  statehouse. 
It  would  occupy  twice  as  much  as  now  if  its  library  and  collections  were  suita- 
bly placed.  The  rooms  now  occupied  are  in  different  parts  of  the  basement 
portion  of  the  capitol  building,  widely  separated,  and  situated  in  every  way 
inconvenient  for  use  and  access  to  the  public. 

In  view  of  the  contemplated  provision  for  the  completion  of  the  capitol 
building,  it  is  urgently  demanded  that  plans  should  now  be  adopted  for  per- 
manent and  ample  rooms  for  the  Society.  During  the  last  session  of  the  leg- 
islature this  subject  of  permanent  rooms  was  brought  before  that  body,  and 
the  state  architect  was  consulted  by  a  legislative  committee ;  but  as  no  action 
was  taken  for  the  completion  of  the  building,  nothing  was  done  toward  pro- 
viding permanent  quarters  for  the  Society. 

In  estimating  for  room  space  for  our  library  and  collections,  we  have 
taken  the  rooms  of  the  Wisconsin  state  historical  library  as  in  considerable 
measure  an  index  of  our  needs.  That  society  occupies  three  floors  of  a  wing 
of  the  state  capitol  building  at  Madison,  built  mainly  for  the  use  of  the 
society,  and  completed  in  1884.  Each  floor  containing  these  rooms  is  106 
feet  in  length  by  62  feet  in  breadth.  The  floor  space  of  the  three  floors  js 
nearly  20,000  square  feet.  The  area  of  the  floor  space  occupied  by  our 
Society  at  present  is  about  3,000  feet.  Thus,  the  Wisconsin  society  occupies 
nearly  seven  times  as  much  room  as  our  Society.  The  library  of  the  Wis- 
&lt;3onsin  society  contains  160,000  volumes.  Our  library  contains  79,000 
volumes;  our  library  being  nearly  one-half  as  large  as  the  Wisconsin 
library,  but  possessing  but  about  one-seventh  as  much  room.  The  Wiscon- 
sin society  occupies  three  and  a  half  times  the  room  of  one  of  the  floors  of  a 
wing  of  our  state  capitol  building. 

These  statements  show  that  our  library  should  have  provided,  for  its 
present  and  future  needs,  room  space  at  least  equal  to  that  of  two  entire 
floors  of  a  wing  in  our  statehouse.  These  statements  are  based  upon  actual 
measurements.  They  are  made  in  accordance  with  library  experience  and 
library  rules  derived  from  experience.  At  our  present  rate  of  increase,  all 
the  space  of  two  floors  of  one  of  the  wings  of  our  capitol  building  will  be 
required  to  answer  the  needs  of  our  Society  within  the  next  five  years.  A 
conference  with  the  state  architect  on  this  subject  has  led  to  the  opinion, 
that  in  view  of  existing  plans  for  the  completion  and  occupancy  of  the 
capitol  building,  and  in  view  of  assignment  of  room  already  made  and  con- 
templated, provision  for  the  Historical  Society  can  best  be  made  in  the  east 
wing,  the  two  main  floors  being  given  for  that  object.  The  rooms  on  those 
floors,  as  now  understood,  will  be  mainly  or  wholly  vacated  by  the  depart- 
ments now  occujDying  them  by  their  removal  into  other  portions  of  the 
building.'!^ 


*  These  recommendations  as  to  room  for  the  permanent  home  for  the  Society  In  the  capitol  build- 
ing, as  made  by  our  Board  of  Directors  at  the  November  meeting,  1894,  received  the  approval  of  the 
legislature  of  1895,  through  the  passage  of  a  concurrent  resolution  directing  that  the  two  floors  of  the 
east  wing  of  the  capitol  below  the  senate  chamber  be  fitted  up  for  the  Kansas  State  Historical  Society, 
when  they  shall  be  vacated  by  the  present  occupants.  — 


18  STATE  HISTORICAL  SOCIETY, 

Our  Society  has  calls  for  present  legislative  action  to  supply  its  urgent 
needs,  as  follows :  Provision  for  permanent  rooms  in  the  completed  capitol 
building,  additional  temporary  room,  increased  funds  for  the  purchase  of 
books,  additional  appropriation  for  clerk  hire,  and  provision  for  present 
printing  needs.  Our  clerical  workers — always  industrious,  skillful,  and 
faithful  —  have  never  been  adequately  paid.  Some  of  them  should  have  in- 
creased salaries.     And  there  is  an  imperative  demand  for  an  additional  clerk. 

Provision  should  be  made  at  the  very  outset  of  the  session  of  the  legisla- 
ture for  the  printing  of  this  report  and  for  the  printing  of  the  catalogue  of 
the  Kansas  portion  of  our  library,  now  ready  for  the  printer.  Our  Society, 
as  before  mentioned,  in  respect  to  the  printing  of  this  report,  has  fallen  under 
the  misfortune  resulting  from  the  scant  printing-  appropriation  made  by  the 
legislature  of  1893. 


MEETINGS,  1893 -'94. 


BOARD   OF  DIRECTORS'  MEETING  — JANUARY  17,  1893. 

The  meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  preparatory  to  the  seventeenth 
annual  meeting  of  the  Society,  was  held  in  the  Society's  rooms,  January  17, 
1893,  at  3  p.  M. 

The  following  members  were  present :  Hon.  Jas.  S.  Emery,  Hon.  A.  R. 
Greene,  Hon.  F.  P.  Baker,  Hon.  S.  C.  Wheeler,  Col.  D.  R.  Anthony,  Hon. 
William  Sims,  Hon.  T.  D.  Thacher,  M.  Weightman,  Hon.  Geo.  W.  Martin, 
Hon.  S.  A.  Kingman,  Hon.  V.  J.  Lane,  Hon.  P.  G.  Lowe,  Mrs.  S.  N.  Wood, 
Col.  C.  K.  Holliday,  George  D.  Hale,  Dr.  P.  McVicar,  Hon.  W.  H.  McBride, 
Hon.  John  Guthrie,  and  Secretary  F.  G.  Adams. 

A.  R.  Greene,  Vice  President,  presided,  in  the  absence  of  Gov.  Thos.  A. 
Osborn,  the  President. 

The  Secretary  stated  the  business  of  the  meeting  to  be  the  consideration 
of  reports  of  committees. 

Judge  Emery,  for  the  committee  previously  appointed  on  the  World's 
Columbian  Exposition,  made  a  verbal  report,  stating  that  the  committee  rec- 
ommend that  an  exhibit  be  made  from  the  collections  of  the  Society,  consist- 
ing of  the  portraits  of  prominent  Kansans,  of  pictures  illustrating  the  history 
of  the  state,  a  full  collection  of  books  by  Kansas  authors,  as  complete  a  col- 
lection as  possible  of  newspapers  published  in  one  or  two  of  the  older  and 
newer  counties,  and  of  mound-builder,  Indian  and  other  relics  peculiar  to 
Kansas  history.  Judge  Emery  mentioned  that  various  private  collections 
had  been  oifered  the  Society  by  Kansas  citizens  for  display  in  connection 
with  the  Historical  Society's  exhibit. 

On  motion  of  Mr.  Baker,  the  Committee  was  continued,  with  full  power 
to  act  in  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  Society's  exhibit,  including  the  pres- 
entation of  a  bill  asking  the  legislature  for  an  appropriation  to  defray  the 


Ninth  Biennial  Report.  19 

actual  expenses  of  such  exhibit,  with  the  understanding  that  no  salary  should 
be  paid  from  such  appropriation. 

The  Secretary  then  read  the  report  of  the  Committee  on  Nominations. 

The  committee  appointed  to  make  arrangements  for  a  Whittier  celebration 
reported  that,  owing  to  lack  of  time,  they  had  done  nothing  in  the  matter, 
and,  at  their  request,  the  committee  was  discharged. 

A  resolution  was  adopted  requesting  the  incoming  officers  and  Executive 
Committee  to  appoint  a  Committee  on  Legislation. 

The  Secretary  presented  the  subject  of  needed  additional  room  for  the 
Society.  On  motion  of  Colonel  Anthony,  a  resolution  was  adopted  request- 
ing the  Legislative  Committee  to  act  with  the  President  and  Secretary  to  frame 
a  bill  for  presentation  to  the  legislature  making  provision  for  room  sufficient 
for  the  present  and  future  needs  of  the  Society. 

On  motion  of  Judge  Kingman,  the  President  appointed  the  following  com- 
mittee of  three  to  draft  resolutions  on  the  services  and  death  of  Col.  Samuel 
N.  Wood,  viz.:  Col.  D.  R.  Anthony,  Hon.  J.  C.  Hebbard,  and  Hon.  George 
\V.  Martin. 

ANNUAL   MEETING   OF   THE   SOCIETY  — JANUARY  17,  1893. 

The  seventeenth  annual  meeting  of  the  Society  was  held  in  the  senate 
chamber,  the  evening  of  January  17,  1893;  Vice  Pres.  Albert  R.  Greene 
in  the  chair. 

The  Secretary  read  an  abstract  of  the  eighth  biennial  report  of  the  So- 
ciety. 

Hon.  AV.  H.  T.  Wakefield,  of  Lawrence,  read  a  paper  on  "Squatter  Courts 
in  Kansas." 

Colonel  Holliday  then  gave  a  brief  history  of  the  origin  and  of  the  events 
of  the  "Wakarusa  War." 

A  paper  written  by  Mrs.  Lois  H.  Walker  (formerly  Mrs.  George  W. 
Brown)  was  then  read,  relating  to  the  bringing  into  Lawrence,  by  herself 
and  Mrs.  S.  N.  Wood,  of  ammunition  from  the  house  of  Mrs.  J.  B.  Abbott, 
for  the  use  of  the  free-state  men  during  the  Wakarusa  war,  and  Mrs.  Wood 
made  a  brief  verbal  statement  of  her  memories  of  the  event. 

The  portrait  of  Col.  S.  N.  Wood  was  then  presented  to  the  Society  by  his 
widow,  Mrs.  Margaret  L.  Wood,  in  the  following  words : 

Mr.  President  :  One  whom  the  people  of  Kansas  will  never  forget ; 
one  who  was  a  true  friend  of  Kansas,  and  consequently  a  true  friend  of  the 
State  Historical  Society,  and  an  earnest  worker  for  the  objects  for  which  it 
was  instituted ;  one  who  was  a  friend  to  his  fellow-men,  and  whose  heart  held 
a  wealth  of  tenderness  and  compassion  for  all  who  suffer  from  wrong,  oppres- 
sion, and  poverty;  one  to  whom  the  hand  of  want  never  reached  out  in  vain. 
He  may  have  had  faults ;  I  have  forgotten  what  they  were.  They  called 
him  a  fighter,  and  a  foe  to  be  dreaded ;  but  whether  friend  or  foe,  in  the  face 
of  want  and  suffering,  his  heart  was  as  tender  as  the  heart  of  a  child.  That 
you  may  keep  his  features  in  mind ;  that  you  may  not  in  this  life  forget  him, 
and  may  know  him  when  you  meet  him  on  the  blest  immortal  shore  of  a  bet- 
ter land,  I  present  you  this  portrait  of  Samuel  N.  Wood. 


20  State  Historical  society. 

Secretary  Adams  accepted  the  portrait  in  behalf  of  the  Society. 
Colonel  Anthony  read  the  following  resolutions,  which  were  unanimously 
adopted  by  the  Society : 

Whereas,  By  the  hand  of  a  cowardly  assassin,  the  Hon.  Samuel  N. 
Wood  has  been  taken  from  us ;  and 

Whereas,  Colonel  Wood  was  an  earnest  and  most  useful  member  of  this 
Society;  a  man  who  himself  helped  to  make  Kansas  history;  a  leader  and  a 
tower  of  strength  in  the  early  struggles  against  slavery;  a  strong,  earnest, 
aggressive  laborer  in  the  cause  of  right,  as  he  saw  the  right;  a  bitter,  unre- 
lenting foe  to  every  wrong  that  presented  itself  to  him  as  wrong:  therefore, 

Resolved,  That  it  is  with  deep  sorrow  that  we  have  heard  of  the  untimely 
and  tragic  death  of  Colonel  Wood ;  and 

Resolved,  That  it  is  our  opinion  that  there  is  a  radical  defect  in  laws  that 
are  impotent  to  punish  his  assassin;  and 

Resolved,  That  we  extend  to  his  bereaved  widow,  who  stood  by  him  for  so 
many  years,  and  was  in  truth  his  helpmate  in  every  good  work,  our  heartfelt 
sympathy,  and  hereby  express  the  sincere  hope  that  she  may  continue  long 
to  supplement  his  faithful  work,  to  which  she  herself  so  largely  contributed; 
and 

Resolved,  That  these  resolutions  be  spread  upon  the  minutes  of  this  Soci- 
ety, and  a  copy  of  them  be  furnished  to  Mrs.  Margaret  L.  Wood,  the  widow. 

The  Kansas  poems  of  John  G.  Whittier  were  then  read  by  Hon.  T.  D- 
Thacher.  Mr.  Thacher  prefaced  the  reading  by  appropriate  remarks  relat- 
ing to  the  character  of  Whittier  and  his  great  sympathy  with  the  people  of 
Kansas  in  their  efforts  to  plant  the  institutions  of  freedom  upon  the  soil  of 
the  new  territory.  The  poems  read  were  the  following:  "The  Kansas  Emi- 
grant's Song,"  "Le  Marais  du  Cygne,"  "The  Burial  of  Barber,"  and  verses 
relating  to  John  Brown. 

The  President  offered  the  following  resolution,  which  was  adopted,  relat- 
ing to  the  subject  of  private  exhibits  offered  the  Society  for  use  at  the  Chi- 
cago exhibition : 

Resolved,  That  the  World's  Fair  committee  be  authorized  and  instructed 
to  accept  from  private  donors  contributions  to  the  Kansas  historical  collec- 
tions in  the  Kansas  building  at  the  World's  Fair  exhibition,  such  objects  of 
historical  interest  as  the  owners  may  present  for  that  purpose,  the  committee 
to  use  its  discretion  as  to  accepting  or  rejecting  such  offers. 

The  following  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  were  then  elected,  for 
the  term  of  three  years,  ending  January  21,  1896:  Jas.  B.  Abbott,  Lucien 
Baker,  W.  L.  Brown,  J.  B.  Chapman,  E.  B.  Cowgill,  Chas.  S.  Davis,  Mrs. 
Anna  L.  Diggs,  Levi  Dumbauld,  A.  G;  Forney,  Warren  Foster,  H.  N.  Gaines, 
J.  M.  Hagaman,  J.  C.  Hebbard,  E.  W.  Hoch,  J.  K.  Hudson,  McCown  Hunt, 
Mrs.  Laura  M.  Johns,  L.  D.  Lewelling,  J.  T.  Little,  Dr.  S.  McLallin,  Dr. 
Peter  McVicar,  P.  B.  Maxson,  Sol.  Miller,  M.  M.  Murdock,  N.  L.  Prentis, 
J.  B.  Remington,  William  Rogers,  Chas.  F.  Scott,  Robert  H.  Semple,  A.  A. 
Stewart,  S.  O.  Thacher,  W.  H.  T.  Wakefield,  A.  B.  Whiting,  and  C.  A.  Wood- 
worth  ;  the  latter  to  fill  vacancy  caused  by  the  removal  of  Rev.  J.  W.  D.  An- 
derson from  the  state.

The  Secretary  read  the  report  of  the  World's  Fair  committee,  as  follows, 
which  was  adopted: 

The  committee  appointed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  to  take  charge  of  the

on  the  application  of  the  committee,  the  Kansas  board  of  managers,  which 
was  appointed  under  the  act  of  the  legislature  making  an  appropriation  for 
the  general  Kansas  exhibit,  granted  to  the  Society  the  sum  of  $500  for  use 
in  making  a  historical  exhibit  in  the  Kansas  building.  From  the  library 
and  collections  of  the  Society  a  selection  was  made  of  Kansas  books  and 
pictures,  and  these  were  shipped  to  Chicago  and  placed  in  the  rooms  assigned 
for  the  Society's  use.  It  is  believed  that  the  historical  exhibit  so  made  con- 
tributed no  inconsiderable  share  to  the  interest  which  attached  to  the  Kansas 
exhibits.  Herewith  is  given  a  detailed  statement  (see  daybook  No.  2,  p. 
82)  of  the  expenditures  in  placing,  caring  for,  and  returning  the  exhibit  to 
the  rooms  of  the  Society,  from  which  it  will  be  seen  that  less  than  the  entire 
sum  of  $500  was  expended,  the  balance  remaining  in  the  hands  of  the  board 
of  managers,  being  the  sum  of  $51.02. 

Respectfully  submitted.  C.  K.  Holliday.

plied by  three  members  to  be  appointed  by  the  chair.  The  motion  was

On  motion  of  Colonel  Holliday,  the  report  of  the  Committee  on  Nomina-

Resolved,  That  the  chancellors  and  presidents  of  all  chartered  Kansas 
universities  and  colleges  should,  by  virtue  of  their  office,  be  considered  as 
corresponding  members  of  the  Historical  Society,  and  that  certificates  to  that 
effect  should  be  issued  to  such  officers  by  the  Secretary. 

Judge  Kingman  then  offered  the  following  resolution,  which  was  adopted  :

speedy  relief,  and  to  his  family  the  warmest  sympathy  in  their  anxiety  and
