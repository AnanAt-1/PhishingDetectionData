On the game-winning goal, the rookie center took a feed from Jon Sim and found the back of the net just 24 seconds into the middle frame. It was Umberger's 16th goal of the season. Antero Niittymaki made 32 saves to pick up the victory in net, as the Phantoms finished a four-game road trip with three wins against just one loss. Philadelphia returns to the Wachovia Spectrum on Friday to face Worcester on its home ice.<br>

							<p>Led by their top line of Patrick McMahon, Lou Sarcone and Justin Kinniry, Cherokee skated to an easy 6-1 win over Washington Township and won its second title in four years. With the familiar #23 jersey worn by Jeff Burd, hanging behind their bench, this emotionally driven group of young men, with one goal in mind, got stronger with each game. Coach Rumbus prior to the game told his players that this was the last year that Jeff's name could go on the trophy, but to go out and also play for each other. Cherokee goalie Bobby Casolaro played a strong game in nets, while the top line accounted for eight points, with McMahon and Kinniry scoring two goals each.<br>

In handing Township its first loss in the double elimination tournament, Cherokee will now host Township on Wednesday night at the Skate Zone in Voorhees. Fred Brewer scored three goals for Township and Kinniry also had a hat trick for Cherokee. Township will need stronger play from their defense and better goaltending, but that still might not be enough as this Cherokee team has raised its level during this tournament. After Brewer gave Township its only lead at 1-0 early in the game, Cherokee scored twice in less than two minutes to take control of the game. First Sarcone broke in with defenseman Steve Sheridan, who had a solid game for Cherokee, and after drawing the defenseman over Sarcone slid the puck to Sheridan and his one-timer beat Matt Corvino and tied the game at 1-1.<br>

The Phantoms auctioned off the team's purple third jerseys from the 2003-04 season, with a portion of the proceeds to be donated to the Phantoms Wives Charities. Silent bidding for the game-worn jerseys was held in the Wachovia Spectrum concourse and ran through the second intermission. The highest silent bids were then used as the starting point for the live auction at Bullies Sports Bar and Restaurant following the game. All Phantoms players and coaches who were on last season's team helped to personally auction off their own jerseys. <br>

Cherokee needs to win Monday to force a second game on Wednesday night at Voorhees. The teams met earlier in the tournament with Township winning 4-2.

Lou Sarcone led the attack with four goals and Matt Loprete added two, Moorestown had goals from five different players. In front of a standing room only crowd at the Skate Zone in Voorhees, both teams came into the game knowing that if you lose your season is over. Super sophomore TJ Brennan put Moorestown on top early in the game as his slap shot along the ice found the long side corner for a 1-0 lead. Cherokee had some opportunities to tie but Colin Higgins stoned Zach Sawyer and Pat McMahon to keep Cherokee off the board. Late in the period Cherokee had a two-man advantage, but excellent penalty-killing by Kevin Schaffer and Mike Bodine denied Cherokee.<br>

The loss ended the Phantoms' four-game winning streak, but Philadelphia still finished 4-1 on its longest road trip of the season. It was the Phantoms' first loss in Cincinnati since March 28, 2001 as they went 5-0-1 in their last six trips there.<br>

Cherokee 2 now advances to the next round and will face Paul VI at Hollydell on Friday night. Shawnee, coming off a 10-5-3 season and a berth in the Flyers Cup, could not muster much offense in the playoffs, scoring just 5 goals. Cherokee 2 has played solid defense and enjoyed hot goaltending by SJ Broadt. Mike Prince led the attack with two goals as Cherokee jumped out to a 3-0 lead after the first period and never looked back.<br>

							<p>Fred Brewer had a goal and three assists to lead Washington Township over a very tough Cherokee 2 squad 6-2 in second round playoff action at Hollydell on Wednesday night. After having a bye in the first round, Township drew Cherokee 2 fresh off its defeat of Paul VI on Monday night, thanks in large part to the stellar play in nets by S.J. Broadt. And after a scoreless first period, Broadt was still on his game turning away all 12 shots. Marco Jordan got Township on the board early in the second period on a nifty pass from Brewer and Chris Keyser. Matt Corvino, playing well in nets for Township, made that lead stand until the last three minutes of the period. With Cherokee down a man, Shane Kelly was sent in by Matt Cardillo and Steve Dellavecchia, and his short-handed goal tied the game at 1-1, heading into the final period.<br>

Brown, who also quarterbacks the football team, gave Rancocas a 1-0 lead three minutes into the game, scoring on a breakaway. West Deptford had a golden opportunity to climb back into the game late in the period as they had a four-minute power play that carried over into the second period. Unfortunately they not only did not capitalize, but Brown, stole the puck and scored a short-handed goal to make it 2-0 early in the second period.<br>

Most of the teams will play on the road, with Washington Township and Moorestown the only two teams hosting games at Voorhees. The Tournament will begin on March 14th. We believe this is the most teams invited to the Flyers Cup from South Jersey since the inception of the league back in 1993.

From the opening period, West Deptford did not look like the 12th seeded team, the last one to make the playoffs, they played as if they belonged and they sure shocked the Vikings. West Deptford carried the play in the first period as they out-shot Eastern 11-8 and scored with just over a minute remaining as Tyler Chellew put home a rebound of a shot by Kevin Walsh. The Vikings responded twenty seconds later as Torin Lawson got the equalizer with the assists going to Chris Ball and Chris Lieg.<br>

Brennan led a balanced attack as five different players scored for Moorestown. Paul VI in their final regular season appearance played well for the first ten minutes of the game, but frustration seem to grow as the game wore on. After Brennan scored at the three-minute mark on a nifty move along the left circle, Paul VI responded on the power play as Rich Ferro feathered a cross-ice pass to Dustin Isbert in front and his goal tied the score at 1-1. That was the extent of the offense for Paul VI despite eleven power play opportunities, they were only able to cash in once and that was the difference in the game.<br>

								<p>Washington Township scored twice in the third period to snap a 5-5 tie and defeat Clearview 7-5 before a packed house at Hollydell. In a game that was tight throughout, where neither team could get an edge or any kind of momentum, Townships&#x2019; depth was a huge factor in this win. Clearview seemed to have the edge in fans in the stands, and Chris Riggs gave them something to cheer about early, as he scored in the opening thirty seconds. Township responded on the power play as Dave Smetaniuk scored with Fred Brewer and Mike Rohach assisting.<br>

							<p>Jon Sim registered two goals and an assist as the Philadelphia Phantoms rolled to a 4-1 victory over the Providence Bruins tonight at the Wachovia Spectrum to extend their club-record win streak to 15 games. Philadelphia is now tied for the second-longest winning streak in AHL history and can match the record of 16 straight victories on Friday when it hosts the Hershey Bears at the Wachovia Center. The Baltimore Skipjacks established the current league record during the 1984-85 season.<br>

						<p>Nine different players scored as Cherokee rolled over Highland 10-0 in the South Jersey High School Ice Hockey League action at the Skate Zone in Voorhees on Monday night. Cherokee scored six goals in the first period and never looked back and were led by Patrick McMahon with two goals and two assists, Dan Altieri and Angelo DiBatista added a goal and an assist. One can only wonder if the league will wake up and correct this unbalanced schedule. For example, the two games we saw last night would have been more competitive had they switched opponents.<br>

						<p>Holy Cross was looking for its first win of the season, but Clearview had too much firepower as they defeated the Lancers 7-0 in action at Voorhees on Monday night. Seven different players scored for Clearview and Holy Cross could only manage 9 shots for the game, and just one in the final period. After Mike Sullivan and Andrew Michaels gave Clearview a 2-0 lead after one period, a four goal second period put the game out of reach. After Steve Short's laser-like blast just over the blue line caught the long side and put Clearview up 3-0 in the first minute of the second period, Clearview continued to put the pressure on Holy Cross.<br>

						<p>The Moorestown Quakes have been just under the radar this season while winning their first six games, but after Monday night&#x2019;s shutout of the Eastern Vikings by 4-0, they are definitely a team to watch. With three lines and unselfish play they resemble the formula the Vikings have used to win consecutive titles the last two years. Eastern started out strong and controlled play for the first six minutes of the game launching nine shots during that time but it was their inability to convert on the power play that would wind up costing them. After Moorestown killed off the first of seven Vikings advantages, the game seemed to turn as the Quakes proceeded to pepper Eastern goalie Ryan Doner with the next thirteen shots. Mike Bodine finally beat Doner, after Kyle Rupin made a great hustle play to keep the puck in at the point, putting home a rebound with Colin Corley and Kevin Schaffer getting the assists.<br>

Led by a hat trick from Tyler Chellew, I was expecting tired legs in the third period, but playing with a lead seem to inspire these Eagles and they played a strong third period and Timber Creek seemed a step behind. West Deptford carried the play for the first two periods, out-shooting Timber Creek 33-6, and actually set a team record holding Timber Creek without a shot on goal in the second period. Gary Scott scored the first of his two goals in the opening period and Timber Creek despite being out-shot 16-6, led 1-0, thanks in large part to the play of goaltender Derek Cafasso.<br>

Smith, along with the rest of his team, was disappointed with their power ranking, which had them listed at number eight. Coach Deroschers took the opportunity prior to the game to point out the ranking and challenged his team to prove us wrong.<br>

							<p>In a battle of the Eastern Conference's two division winners from a year ago, the Hartford Wolf Pack pulled out a 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phantoms tonight at the Hartford Civic Center in the 2004-05 AHL season opener for both clubs.

LaBarbera earned AHL Most Valuable Player honors last season after leading the league in wins (34) and shutouts (13).<br>

						<p>Ryan Morris, Dustin Isbert and Brett Balco scored goals late in the third period to break open a close game as Paul VI captured its first win of the season, defeating St. John Neumann 5-1 at Hollydell on Friday night. Neumann goalie Andrew McKissick was the only reason Neumann was still in the game as his team could only generate two shots through the first two periods, while he faced twenty four. Eric Pollag scored the only goal of the first period, his first as an Eagle, as his shot from the blue line found the short side.<br>
