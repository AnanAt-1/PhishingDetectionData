<p>Anybody can learn HTML! Many readers have used my book, <a rel="" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761526943/creatyourfirstwe"><i>Learn HTML In a Weekend</i></a>, now out in a 3rd Edition, to learn HTML and create effective and attractive web sites. My book has been rated <img src="../images/stars-5-0.gif"> out of five by 7 out of 10 reader reviews at Amazon.co.uk and by 7 out of 14 reader reviews at Amazon.com. (Mac users, see the section on the <a href="#createmac">Mac edition</a> below.)</p>

<p>Yes, it can be done! Many, many of my readers have been able to learn HTML in a weekend or less. You should feel free to take longer, if you wish, of course. I won't hurry you, but encourage you to go at your own pace. The point is, however, that ANYBODY can learn HTML and start creating their own very attractive and effective web pages in a very short period of time. Why wait?</p>

<div class="quote2"><p>"What can I say? BRILLIANT! You simply MUST buy this book, it really does teach you HTML. I picked it up on a Thursday, and had my first webpage on the internet by that Saturday, complete with scrolling bars, forms, graphics, animations, sound...the list goes on! It is one of the best buys that I have ever made." -- from a <A rel="nofollow" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=creatyourfirstwe&path=tg/stores/detail/-/books/0761526943/customer-reviews">customer review</a> at Amazon.com.</p></div>

<p>Start out by reading up on the Web (Friday Evening), learn basic HTML (Saturday Morning) and intermediate HTML (Saturday Afternoon), learn all about creating HTML tables (Saturday Evening), get hands-on experience creating framed web sites (Sunday Morning), learn all about forms (Sunday Afternoon), and create web art special effects using Paint Shop Pro (Sunday Evening). In the appendixes, you'll find an HTML quick reference, an XHTML/XML compatibility guide, a list of non-keyboard character codes, an explanation of using relative URLs, an introduction to cascading style sheets, and a rundown on adding much desired features, such as background sounds, hit counters, guestbooks, GIF animations, Java applets, and more.</p>

<h2>Steve Callihan's Other Web Publishing Books</h2>

<p>I've authored a number of other books on web publishing. Here's a rundown on my other web publishing books:

<p><a rel="" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789726173/creatyourfirstwe"><img class="cover" src="../webbooks/cssbook.jpg" align="left" width="125" height="157"></a>My latest book, which covers using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design web pages and sites that are visually richer, more efficient, and accessible.</p>

<div class="quote2"><p>"I can't tell you how pleasantly surprised I was when I worked thru this book. It is filled with explanations and examples to work thru and covers all the important topics of CSS." -- from a <A rel="nofollow" HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=creatyourfirstwe&path=tg/stores/detail/-/books/0789726173/customer-reviews">customer review</A> at Amazon.com.</p></div>

<p>The current generation of browsers (IE 5 & 6, Netscape 6, and Opera 5 & 6) all support virtually all of CSS1 and much of CSS2 -- the time for CSS is now! CSS allows you to create web designs that are impossible in HTML -- specify any font size, add margins and padding to any element, set borders and backgrounds for any element, position elements anywhere on the page, and much, much more. Learning the basics of CSS is easy -- anybody can start using CSS right away to enhance the appearance and impact of their web pages.</p>
