In November 1960, the airport was renamed Montreal-Dorval International Airport/Aéroport international Dorval de Montréal.

With an operations zone of 70 km² (27 sq mi) and a buffer zone of 290 km² (112 sq mi), it became the largest airport in the world. Many connecting flights to Canadian centres were transferred to Montréal-Mirabel and 23 international airlines moved their overseas activities there. As a consequence, the mission of Montréal-Dorval was redefined to encompass domestic flights and flights to the United States. Mirabel's traffic decreased due to the advent in the 1980s of longer-range jets that did not need to refuel in Montreal before crossing the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("3143",this,"atlantic_ocean.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("3143")' href="/topics/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a><span class="hp" id="m3143"><div class="hpHeader">Atlantic Ocean</div><div class="hpContent"><div class="hpImage" id="i3143"></div>The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's oceanic divisions.

The Trudeau government had developed Mirabel Airport to handle an expected growth in international traffic, and, eventually, to replace Dorval.

With all international scheduled flights going back to Montréal-Dorval in 1997, as well as charter flights in 2004, Montréal-Dorval International Airport was finally able to become a true hub, where passengers would not have to travel to different airports depending on the type of flight. The consolidation of flights to Montréal-Dorval resulted in an increase of passenger traffic, not only because of transfer of flights, but because of new connecting opportunities. In 2000, 9.4 million passengers used the airport at a time when the maximum capacity was 7 million. In 2010, the airport handled 12,969,834 passengers, a new record.

<br />
The expansion program included the construction of several brand-new facilities, including a jetty for flights to the United States (US Preclearance Terminal), another for other international destinations (International Terminal), and a huge international arrivals complex.

Additionally, sections of the domestic area were renovated and expanded, accompanied with additional retail space. The International part of the Aeroquay satellite was demolished, leaving the domestic part for regional carriers. The completion of the CAD$716 million expansion gives Montréal-Trudeau the ability to serve 15 million passengers a year. This ironically accomplished one of the goals that was to be met with the construction of Mirabel. (In the 1970s, the federal government projected that 20 million passengers would be passing through Montreal's airports annually by 1985, with 17 million through Mirabel). Aéroports de Montréal financed all of these improvements itself, with no government grants. By the end of 2007, $1.5 billion had been spent to upgrade Montréal-Trudeau.<br />

Originally scheduled to be completed by September 2008, the 279 first-class room hotel opened its doors on 19 August 2009. Construction was slowed down because of the recession and a collapse in the Transborder market. It will eventually contain an underground train station to connect it with downtown Montreal as well as ADM's corporate headquarters, currently located in downtown Montreal.<br />
<br />
On the same day, Montreal-Trudeau airport opened the doors to the refurbished, expanded, modernized and user-friendly transborder terminal, meeting the industry's highest standards. This increased the total area of the terminal from 9320 square metre. Furthermore, the terminal is equipped with a new baggage sorting room which allows U.S. customs officers to retrieve luggage for secondary inspection.<br />
<H3>International terminal expansion (2011–2016)</H3>
In July 2011, Mr. James Cherry, the CEO of Aéroports de Montreal, announced that they're planning a two-phase expansion of Montréal-Trudeau’s international terminal. He also added that when the expansion project will be completed in 2016, the international terminal will have 17 contact gates compared to 11 currently. In other words, it will be expanded with 6 new gates. Furthermore, 2 remote stands will also be added. The total cost of the project is expected to be between CAD500 million and CAD600 million.<br />
<H3>Other projects</H3>
Starting in 2006, ADM began the next process of land access to upgrade road traffic to the airport, a new parking garage, and the improvement of the domestic terminal. On 30 November 2006, ADM announced plans to relocate numerous hangars at the western part of the airport in order to expand the Transborder and International terminals. In October 2010, it was revealed that the international jetty will be expanded with an addition of four new gates, one of which will be able to accommodate the <a class='greylink1'  onMouseover='ShowPop("12478",this,"noimage.gif", event)' onMouseout='HidePop("12478")' href="/topics/Airbus_A380">Airbus A380</a><span class="hp" id="m12478"><div class="hpHeader">Airbus A380</div><div class="hpContent">The Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by the European corporation Airbus, a subsidiary of EADS.

Aéroports de Montréal is planning to introduce an express rail shuttle service to accelerate access to the airport from the downtown core.

The main issue with the project, aside from cost, is how it will improve public transit on the West Island.
