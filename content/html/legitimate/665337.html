      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Crowned Pigeons are the largest members of
      the pigeon family. They are as large as a full grown turkey hen.
      There are 3 species of Crowned Pigeons, all are from New Guinea.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">All three are very similar and differ primarily
      in the placement of the maroon color, the size and brightness
      of the wing patch, and the size and color of the crest feathers.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">These large imposing pigeons are certainly
      among the most attractive if not the most bizarre birds. Most
      people, upon first seeing them, do not recognize them as pigeons
      due to their size. However, their size is someone deceiving,
      as the body is rather small by comparison to a similar size turkey.
      Their large, loose and fluffy feathers give them the appearance
      of being much larger than they really are.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">The sexes are identical in <B><A HREF="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35639.htm">appearance</A></B>
      but males are often larger than females, and the experienced
      pigeon breeder would likely have little trouble distinguishing
      males from females. Males do sing as most pigeons do, only the
      Crowned Pigeons are said to boom rather than coo. The loud sound
      of a male Crowned Pigeon is a series of low notes which sound
      very similar to &quot;boom boom&quot; , &quot;boom boom&quot;,
      two loud notes in rapid succession.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Crowned Pigeons have been bred in captivity
      since the 1800's but due to their slow reproductive nature (raising
      only one or two, rarely 3 young, per year) they have never been
      very common in private collections. Most Crowned Pigeons are
      held by zoos and there are only a handful of private breeds in
      the US who keep them. You can hear birds like these Crowned Pigeons
      outside your window while on a <B><A HREF="http://bookit.com/caribbean/dominican-republic/">Dominican
      Republic vacation</A></B>. Exotic pigeons among other birds such
      as pelicans, pauraques, clapper rails, and many others can be
      found in the world's greatest wildlife reserve which is found
      south of <B><A HREF="http://bookit.com/mexico/cancun/">Cancun</A></B>.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Reproduction is slow but often steady. Once
      a pair of Crowned Pigeons is established and breeding, they will
      breed regularly for many years, producing usually one or two
      offspring each year. They lay a single large white egg about
      the size of a <B><A HREF="http://www.ustr.gov/archive/Document_Library/Op-eds/2003/Committed_in_Cancun.html">chicken
      egg</A></B>. The egg hatches after 30 days of incubation, and
      the young pigeon remains in the nest, cared for by both parents,
      for an additional 30 days. One the young pigeon leaves the nest,
      it is dependent on the parents for food for an additional month.
      So the entire process of raising a single Crowned Pigeon takes
      no less than 3 months to complete. It is a very slow process.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Crowned Pigeons mature fast, and a young bird
      reaches sexual maturity at about 2 years of age though many individuals
      will not breed until they are much older. I have had Blue Crowned
      Pigeons to begin breeding as early as 2 years of age. They are
      very long lived birds, as there are reliable zoo records of breeding
      Crowned Pigeon in the mid 20's.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Their diet in captivity consist mostly of
      grain, small dry kibbled dog food, and chopped fruit. Crowned
      Pigeons essentially eat the same grains one would feed any domestic
      or exotic pigeon or game bird, but they love diced apple, banana,
      grapes and fresh raw peanuts. Practically any chopped fruit offered
      will be accepted. My Crowned Pigeons love diced longhorn cheese,
      which I provide several times per week as a source of protein
      and calcium. They prefer the cheese to any grain or fruit, but
      it should be fed sparingly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Crowned Pigeons are easily tamed and become
      very trusting birds once acclimated to an aviary. My birds will
      eat out of my hand if I offer them preferred treats. They require
      lots of room and the minimum size aviary should be at least 20
      feet long by 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall for a single pair.
      Due to their size they should be kept alone. However they are
      normally not aggressive towards other species. No more than a
      single pair of Crowned Pigeons can be kept and breed in an enclosure.
      Pairs, particularly males, are not tolerant of other Crowned
      Pigeons in their enclosure.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">They will nest in any open flat platform or
      shallow basket. Being not winter hardy, these birds should be
      kept in frost free conditions. While they will tolerate some
      low temperatures, they are very uncomfortable if temperatures
      fall below 40F and should never be allowed to experience prolonged
      freezing conditions.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">I acquired my first Crowned Pigeon in 1971,
      a male. Then a year later I purchased a female. The pair produced
      19 eggs in a single year and never paid attention to any them.
      The female would lay a egg nearly every 2 weeks. The eggs were
      fertile but hand raising Crowned Pigeons has always been extremely
      difficult, and rarely successful. Even experienced hand feeders
      at some of the best zoos in the country shun the idea of trying
      to hand raise a Crowned Pigeon. Seems many trials eventually
      result in birds not making it beyond the 21st day. For some reason
      that particular period in the young birds development is critical
      and most succumb. This is not unique to Crowned Pigeons, as nearly
      all exotic pigeons are very difficult to raise from day one.
      Nevertheless my first pair did eventually settle down during
      their second year and successfully incubated and raise young.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Many people have written to me requesting
      information about these spectacular Pigeons especially their
      cost. Currently Crowned Pigeons sell for about $2000 - $2500
      each in the private sector. I personally have not had any to
      offer for sale in recent years but other breeders in the US whom
      I have recently spoken with, quoted those prices based on birds
      they had recently sold. Pairs are rarely available from any breeder,
      because the young Crowned Pigeons are produced singly. Thus the
      surplus of even a single bird is quickly exhausted.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Finding two birds or true pairs for sale will
      never be easy. Most breeders, myself included, start by purchasing
      a single bird, sexed or unsexed it makes no difference. Then
      the search begins for a second companion to establish a true
      pair. I have found it far easier to acquire a second Crowned
      Pigeon when a mate is needed to assemble a breeding pair, than
      it is to seek out a pair of birds.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Most all of the Crowned Pigeons in US collections,
      both private and in Zoos, are part of a stud book breeding program
      established a number of years ago by US zoos. Therefore, once
      a single bird is acquired, the stud book keeper may have a greater
      incentive to find a second surplus bird for the person wanting
      to establish a pair. Bottom line, if you are truly interested
      in Crowned Pigeons, never turn down the opportunity to acquire
      a single bird.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="+1">Of all the birds I have kept these magnificent
      Pigeons are certainly among my favorite.</FONT></P>
